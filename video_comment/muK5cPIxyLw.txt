No doubt the days of the west is setting and the rise of the east is now shining. I love my country and id wish they could be in the conversation. However, have become stagnate
V..L.Audio!
Thank you Trump,
no big deal, many customers are on waiting list.
Enjoy, Maggots , 😅😅😅
And literally no one is saying it’s time to get rid of Trump. Nobody except for one person in the house. It’s a crime shame. The whole public is not saying something.
Good other countries want them planes😅😅😅
Most majority voted so now why crying?
Donald Trump is a traitor and a Fascist. Lock him up!
Well people, you voted!
This is doubtful.When  you buy an aeroplane , you pay a huge deposit , enter into a contract and no matter what the tariff or tax going to be the client would have to go with the order they placed. You will lose your deposit and face a lawsuit if you change your mind - it’s not like refusing to buy an off the shelf wine bottle
Don't give them their money back! They sent a used plane so they get 25% of their return back!
America finally feel the pain, you know those Chinese products in Costco, if it’s not selling those items, it will ship back to the manufacturer, and they don’t pay not even for shipping, so many factories were closed down because of this…
America doesn't make any parts for jets or cars or trains or just about anything..  Soon Boeing might close for good !
if they dont want our planes they can build theor own that fall out of the sky lol at least our only have door fall off lol.  short tearm pain for long tearm gain
well there was clearly a person of interest
Yep, return to sender !! 🙀🇳🇿
Making America NOT SO Great
There is a saying "Becareful for what you wish for" - America wants their products made in USA and raise prices. You got it
its ok if china returns it. other countries can buy it. china will only steal aviation updates they buy
Question for MAGA TRUMP  "HEI PSS PSS PRESIDENT  being the situation as such, whose ass is being kissed".
Love to see Democrats whine.
FAFO
FAFO
Excellent news,  let's see how that yapping went for amerikans. China now will flood its skies with Russian liners
What happens if Boeing retaliates by refuse to service all the Boeing planes in China? This is a mess
So china lost it's huge deposit and other countries snapped them up before the engines even had a chance to cool down😂
Why do you Americans put of with this crap?
Viva mexico 🇲🇽
Bye America, bye jobs!!
India is going to bye Boing
How much you selling it for $
The people around the world not stupid only Republicans voters and trump the stupid o corruption government.
Something for  MEGA to be proud of.
Dont forget trump airlines 😅😅😅😅😅
Trump is on a losing streak
Tarriffs are IMPOSED BY THE IMPORTERS... NOT the exporters...  jeez, 8th grade economics...  if I mistakenly assume importer and exporter does not need to be defined, sorry, my bad...
🤣🤣🤣
Empty shelves coming soon! Watch for it!
From England. What  i find hard to understand is why the hell font the American  government sbd prople  arrest or impeach trump. Even  a young child  wojld see what trump is doing and why
"Return to the Manufacturer " bye-bye!
We,Malaysia hv ordered 60 units of Boeing and we hit with 24%,Trump tariffs,he said imbalance trade 😂
Don't sell them any more planes. Let them build their own.
I bet you guys vote for Trump in 2028!
Ironically, that Boeing plane was made with parts from Chiina!
Good news for Airbus .
Enjoy the results of voting poorly.
THIS JUST TO TELLING YOU AND ALL HIGH STANDARD AMERICANS WHO IS BELIVES WORLDS IS RULED BY AMERICANS LAWS AND BELIVES AMERICANS IS THE ONLY ONCE HAVING SPECIALS RIGHTS ON EARTH ALONGSIDE WORLDS JUST MUST DOING ALL AMERICANS ORDERS. ONE MORE THING, THIS SHOWING HOW STUPIDS AMERICANS WHO IS VOTING DONALDUMBESTRUMP AS YOURS PRESIDENT. TRUMP RISING TARRIFF NOT JUST ECONOMIC, EVEN LAST NIGHT HIS WIFE DENNYING HIS 8NTIMACY WILL COUSING TRUMP TARRIFF GONE STUPID
Ppl at airbus 😎
Russia and China both making good air plane now. US is going down thanks to corrupted ukraine/biden war.
Who want the crushing toys.
Apparently Trump's Policy: "PUSH former Allies into China's Arms and then wonder WHY USA is standing ALONE against China". :P Genius Plan, not.
Agent Krasnov since inauguration (from 20JAN25 to 25APR25) worked tirelessly to strengthen Ruble by +10% (from 104.975 to 93.9008 for euro) AND to weaken US dollar by -10% (from 1.02785 to 1.13473 for euro). Putin is proud of his asset in White House.
Easy to resale. It's called Next in line.
China to usa : You not that guy..
As soon as the doors started falling off, I'd be returning them, tarrifs or not.
Well maybe Boeing should stop giving tons of money to republican politicians proves that corporations aren’t as smart as they think they are the price they are going to pay for their Huge tax breaks won’t matter to much if no one will buy from them congratulations you played yourself
Make it the New Air force 1 Donnie
Way to go MAGA!!
I’m rooting for Donny boy as he is making China greater than it was before while bankrupting his own country 😂🤣 Thank you Donny for this opportunity of European Union countries stock markets on a winning streak and Euro value skyrocketing 👏💪😂🤣. Please continue using the only English ward you know how to pronounce correctly “tariffs “ 😂🤣
I've told  people before that only people in financial turmoil seek bankruptcy, and no well off retiree would take on a job unless they are in financial straights.
Sorry  im missing the point of this story.  America is getting what it voted for.
Oh well
China is winning. Trump is losing.
F*****g Trump caused this stupid situation.
What countries wants to deal with America…with tariffs imposed on them? NONE! Airbus  will be the big winner…thanks to Trump ‘s tariffs..
Haha omg
AIRBUS is happy.
DEPORTED !@#$ THERE U GO IMBECILE !@#$ PRES. XI TELLING US, THERE IS NOTHING THAT CN NEEDS FROM U !@#$ ALSO NO MORE OF SALES OF CN GOODS MADE BY HARD WORKING CHINESE FOR CHEAP TO SUBSIDISE AMERICANS’ STANDARD OF LIVING, TO U SO NO MORE OF YOUR JUNK USD !@#$ USD IS NO LONGER LEGAL TENDER FOR YUAN EXCHANGE IN CN !@#$
And my MAGA Sister insists, “trust the plan, he knows what he is doing”And when I called him a faggy moron she severed all contact
Please stop the madness! This is really bad!
They will repaint in and give to airline  waiting for it new order and keep the China Airlines deposit since it was never Call Eric is still a new  built airline
How you like your Trump now
. . . HunterBiden should be President of China 😅 😂 😅 😂
There is a Yorkshire saying, if they show you The finger , give them a fist.
China makes their own aircraft’s nowadays…..won’t be long before China doesn’t need Boeing or Airbus 😂
Australia is picking up your exports…….thank you Mr Trump……
Summarizing. The plane was sent to China and China sent back to USA. It arises many questions.   Who pays freight? I mean the transportation back and forth? That's kind the question that pops in my head.
I hope the Trump Junkies are not surprised by this.......
Mexican Gulf! Forever!

We've entered the 'find out' phase of FAFO.  As an aside, Poland has already cancelled their plans to buy American F-35 fighter jets and Portugal and Canada are planning to do the same.
WOW. I'm glad I am not in the U.S. THANKS TRUMP you degenerate - Buffoon, and who cares about Wine from the U.S. Everyone knows that Europe Makes the Best Wine.
Well played MAGA, well played! 😂😂😂
Oligarchs are now crying. All they think is their own pockets.
COMAC just needed a foot in the door.
General Xi ate orange chicken for lunch.
No tax on tipps 😅 bring it home
I wander who that plane belongs to 😅
Is it a 737😅😅
Trump and his republicans are doing a fine job of killing America from within, and they are not near done yet!!!  America will be but a husk of it's former self within six months!  They are making sure America never recovers!   The Republicans have been waiting and watching and preparing for the last forty years to take over and transform America into Russia and it's happening right now, and there is noting we can do to save our country from a fascist dictator and his republicans except complain, protest and oppose in congress and the press while the fascist march on decimating this nation from within!   Trump and his Republicans took over and transformed America into a fascist dictatorship easier then Hitler and his NAZI Party took over Germany!  Disgusting!!!!  Even Putin is amazed how easy it was!
Donald trump's wisdom is mind boggling.dumb s+-t
We don’t need China. China needs us.  China needs to make a deal with us” - White House secretary Carolina leavi.
Surprise?  You’ve been trying to screw your customer, calling them names, lying about them, accusing them of taking advantage of you...  Now you expect them to pay up for your products?  What kind of lucid dream is that?  You should be happy that China is no longer “taking advantage” of merica 😂😂😂😂
When they going to send back the Air Force from china 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No countries want to buy a floating coffin.
Dear USA, you “voted” for this mess, now you clean it up!
Good
TRUMP SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR AMERICA, BUT, BY THE TIME HE ,AND, HIS REGIMEN ARE FINISHED, THERE WON'T BE AN AMERICA!!!!
ARE WE AMERICANS  PROUD OF HOW GREAT TRUMP,VANCE,MUSK,CONGRESS, AND THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS MAKING AMERICA 😢😢😢😢
trump HAS PICKED A FIGHT WITH CHINA HE CANT WIN and WHY, CHINA WILL AND IS MOPPING THE FLOOR WITH trump BEING THE ORANGE-MOP ONLY THE BEST ORANGE-MOP WILL DO ?
"A new golden age for America " he said.
#ThankYouTrump!!!
Shiped like ordered...
CHINA LOVE AMERIKA
Let's ban Canadian spirits in the US then.
well , if the plane is ordered by client , the client must already paid the majority of cost before it head for the final delivery , right ? so i guess china lost the plane plus the cost they already paid ? a very bad idea stupid idea , meanwhile Boeing already earn the majority of money and still keep the plane ?
China said to US keep your Boeing, we will fly with COMAC in the future...
America first? Fine, keep your planes.
Already spoke for, By other countries, 😅😅😅😅😅😅, So funny. Wow that was Fast,
Your president, Trump, started all of this.  He called us "nasty" and broke a free trade treaty he himself negotiated and signed.  He has threatened our sovereignty.  Don't piss off 41 million prospective consumers.  Our supermarkets have labels to indicate if the product on the shelf is Canadian now.  This won't end well for anyone.  Your news coverage glosses over Trump.  This is the Trump recession beginning.... let's hope it doesn't become a depression.
When Trump was imposing tariffs, he was thinking about America exports hamburgers and chicken fingers not heavy duty equipments.
We don't trust democrats anymore...
Trump has a lot in common with a 737MAX. It literally crashes itself into the ground despite all attempts by pilots (aka people who know what they are doing) to regain some kind of control.
Lay off it the Nama of the game.
America has no concept that it is a global joke.
But don't Boeing have back orders of 737  that can be fulfilled otherwise trump will have to admit he's fucked up
wow FOX vs Trunk😅 ,,,,the biggest issue  tim advisor economic Trump like Peter Navaro , Economic Technology not only in USA but every Country has been grow even Taliban 🤣🤣
when the EU just talk to much bla bla bla but no one have a ball to fight US trade, Cina show off with 145% tariffs to US😢
Many airlines rent a Boeing commercial aircraft.
We all hate Obama, Bush Jr/Sr, The Clintons, Evil Biden and Trump... The US funds and supports genocides since more then 50 years, no freedom, no democracy, no humanity or honesty at all.
😂😂😂😂 Americans think this is 1990
The rest of the world no longer wants products from dud countries with fascist leaders.
I-m- peach the orange
China send them back
It’s because china can’t pay for it

Yessss!
Make america pariah again 😂😂
Where are the MAGA that normally respond to Fox News?
Can the Chinese make aircraft?  They probably can the doors may even stay closed.
Well The US thinx can destroy China's economy     but they are Playing with fire!!
Making business with China supports their communist regime that even to this day persecutes people based on their religious beliefs .
I wanted trump to win cause my cheating ex (trump supporter , not even rich ) is in america
Love it,love it.But hate it for the affect on our friend and neighbor US. When I was a kid (65yrs ago) in school in the UK.Our history teacher told us that,one day the Chinese will take over the world.But not with guns, just by moving into countries and by trade. Obviously a wise man
Thnaks Donald, you certainly are an obstinate moron!
You voted. You wanted it that way. Greetings from Switzerland
This is great Trump needs to be apprehended and brought to justice.
Commies don’t need to fly anywhere. They can make their own harbor freight planes.
FAFO  you got what you voted for.   FDJT The Wannabe dictator/king and dictator lover The convicted felon and liable rapist criminal Antichrist belongs to prison  Viva Canada 🇨🇦
'Tariff China because they aren't good at all government-wise and it is bad for the US to be in the position it is in with them.  But to tariff the whole world, if it goes through, may not be too wise. '
Orange Jesus loves you ! Thoughts and prayers. Thank a magat 😂
That’s exactly what the majority of the American voters want.
😂 other countries are lining up to buy these aircraft. This just shortens the wait times for receiving aircrafts for other countries. 😂
Why are we hurting our economy? Check your 401k too.
So what about all the farmland china owns in this country,more then 100,000 acres of land growing food and making money on our land!
Serve USA companies and citizens right for electing a stupid lunatic to run amock the world economy! Asia now no longer is a pushover
Wait, if Boeing can't sell commercial jets; how tf are they going to fund the F47 program. 🤔  Not well thought out this tarrif strategy is.
Awwww self crashing tech cant find anywhere to call home except its own old lair awwww;((((
Trump is on a roll. He is even killing tourism.
LOL, juicy order to Airbus!
Trump will have you in a depression shortly.
China is broke and using tarrif war as an excuse to cancel orders and deliveries.
America should be boycotted by all the nation throughout the world!
If I was a Sales Director of Airbus, I would be rubbing my hands and waiting for a call from my contacts in China, requesting to come over for a meeting. China has painted itself into a corner as there are not THAT MANY manufacturers of aircraft in the world anyway. So when China turns up I would be thinking ; 1. they have nowhere else to go, other than small manufacturers who are not set up to build aircraft of this size and in the expected quantity. 2. our order book is already quite healthy, so we dont need to do any favours on price. In fact quite the opposite......we have AN OPPORTUNITY and need to cash in on it while the going is good.  Very high price to pay, just to make a childish, two-fingered gesture to Donald Trump ?
China tariffs on US goods before 2017 Trump 1st Tariff on China was 2%. Trump lies are the real problem and the MAGATs beleive him.
At least this 737 Max made it back, no such luck with Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
Where is Boeing mgt ?
I voted for this❤ google the highest gas price of all time and you’ll find it in June 20 22 google inflation under Trump when he gave it to Biden and you’ll find it was one percent❤
the Airbus crowd  just popped more Grug, it can happen.
This report is pure BS. What do you expect from a Democratic Party sponsored (controlled) TV station.
Karma!
china don't need anything from usa, china don't need boeing, CHINA CAN BUILD ADVANCED SOPHISTICATED AIRPLANES, usa was blackmailing HUAWEI
Boeing called Donald Trump. I'm told him that's enough. .... That's why he's doing it reversal...... It just goes to show you that the President doesn't run anything. The billionaires behind the companies actually run the show.
🗺️ ~ You know, Canada might start making many Americans mad if they don’t use TARGETED punishment. Target people in places that voted for Trump, not other places.  But I will say typically I would not like for other countries to target voters of any president that I liked or did not like. But that’s because typically the president pretty much operates as a president for everybody And maybe helped out certain areas that voted for him by putting the thumb on the scale a little bit, maybe a small benefit. It’s kinda like the cherry on top. But I know how Trump acts, and precedent of how presidents are supposed to act does not constraint him. Many of his supporters say that’s a good thing, and all of his worshipers say that’s a great thing. But following the person who has come before you and only making certain changes with the consensus of all Americans is a good thing. And so he doesn’t care about that and he’s perfectly fine punishing places that is not gonna represent because he knows they will never vote for him, then that cancels what I said before.
They sent it back!!😮😮
It was a criminal move to sell and rebuy stocks.
Not on the runway, on the apron.
The orange old man will destroy great America.
Please support President Trump "Make America Great Again'😂😂😂
You voted for a fool serves you right
Now other countries can take the opportunity to buy the flight for a bargain!
How did the USA allow itself to get into this mess? It was a great country for which, as a Brit, I had real affection. But now I find the actions (tariffs, threats to Canada, Greenland, Panama, Mexico etc and now seeking despotic control of your education establishments) taken by your Government are beyond appalling. I cannot see America ever regaining its reputation as a reliable partner in anything. All very sad but the World is showing that it can do without the USA and will leave it isolated.
Huaarghhh ha ha ha ha ha  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chinese buffet is open. Bon appétit, Airbus!
Forgot to mention the huge wait list  for planes. Those returned planes have buyers already.
🤣🤣
BULL SHIT WILL ONLY CARRY YOU SO FAR AMERICA, THE WORLD FOUND YOU OUT NOW.
Now China gets to fly their tofu jets 😂
Well done trumps you absolute genius, the president USA needed and you stuffed it up badly… well you kno
Let's find a domestic buyer. Simple.
Demand exceeds supply of 737 Max’s so these returns will simply benefit our domestic airlines who will snap them up. Everyone wins except China if you ask me.
It is not the provincial alcohol control boards that are are pulling US alcohol off the shelves except in one province. It s that Trump has so pissed off the Canadian people that we, as a people, are boycotting US products. To at least 90% of Canadians, you cannot, at this time, give the stuff away.
Sent these planes to India... Air India has order 40+ planes from Boeing .
well, it's their money. also the MAX does not have a very trustworthy flight history...
Stirring hornets' nests...this is what you get as a sample
Fox forgets what it said about China? Now it starts blaming Trump only.   With FOX’s misinformation about China and others I doubt Trump has any chance to be the president.   So face it now.  Do anything  positive helping people whom you’ve done to.
Just stop all these nonsense now before it’s too late!
Are these airplanes sent back Before or After they copied the software from it? Why is Boeing stupid enough to do what the government blocked McDonell Douglas in the 90s from doing?
Trump is really brilliant. W. T. F. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh, who cares Boeing sucks.
Don't think Canada will be buying anything from Boeing
Impeach🤡🍊💩🤮👎
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!
FAFO
Good job MAGA!
Oh waaaaah.  You cannot sell wine in China and Canada.  How about selling it in the US...or is it crap that no one would dring?
Omg the golden age of America began.
Trump lie to us😢😢
India and Malaysia said they will buy all the Boeing planes rejected by China
How do you say, "F*ck off, Donnie" in Chinese?
Maruming magnegosyo ang Tsina... sinira nila reputasyon ng Boeing para makilala ang gawa mismo ng Tsina.
bye bye Boeing.....
They are not reporting that countries that were supposed to wait 5 to 7 years for their orders want these planes that are being canceled by China.  China still just playing a bad hand
Boeing 737 Max is a death trap 😱
Boeing, you can thank mthrfkr Trump.
​@gvs376 exactly. This trade war the United States has started with its allies is beyond silly. On the one hand, doing nothing would be an appropriate response from a consumer's perspective since why would anyont want to pay more for goods. But with all of these US tariffs hitting imports of inputs the cost of goods for everybody is going to go up anyway. So countries that have been hit with tariffs have to hit back even in the short term causing pain to everyone in the hope that cooler heads eventually prevail. Basically like everyone owning nuclear weapons. But for the defensive trade response, it's better to hit fully assembled goods that are either easily swapped out or are more luxuries. So pulling American wines off the shelves doesn't really impact wine drinkers since there are plenty of substitutes. And some people might not like it but is possible to go without Kentucky bourbon for a year.
Then make the USA reunite and beside its been awhile that other countrty wants the US down specially china….so why we the people reunite for our country🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

USA should keep cleaning coal, as diaper boy proclaimed. As far as "raw earths" lolol! Well, yes many countries can mine them, but only China has a monopoly on refining over 90% of the demand. Once again USA whines while others look ahead.

How many of you so called victims voted for hitler ?
Is America great yet?
When the US government weaponise tariffs to humiliate and bully the rest of the world, this is what happens.
That should not be a surprise.  Ban Huawei, ban  Tik-Tok,  ban exports from Xinjang ban exports of microchip to China, 100% of EV from China, now overall tariff raised to 245%.  Joy to the world. 👍🇨🇦
USA will start to learn what uncertainty  does to inflation , trump tariff war has become an inflation war ,your dollar is going to hurt you , impeach the moroon, conman and liar  in the White House  .Lock him up .He is the new world dictator.
May 1st onwards you are going to see truckers suddenly realise Covid was a walk in the park.

Great again right? America first! We are sooo winning this trade war! 😂😂😂
Thank to Trump who caused the whole Chaos. He makes America weaker not great. Xi and Puntin other Presidents laughing at his chaotical plan.
Usless Trump
Tired of winning yet? 🤡
Way to go Trump, I say sarcastically
Thousand of waiting list, why worry? Somebody will grab it in no time
God, i love karma. i had no clue yall depended on trade so much. Makes the tariffs that much better. Two birds with one stone type of stuff. Kudos trump 😇
Boeing has been doing a bad job for a long time. China is right about this.
I don’t hate Donald Trump. But I am sure sorry that so many Americans overlooked his rude, aggressive, bullying style. And his lack of competence as a leader. Unfortunately, the middle and lower economic classes in the US will suffer most from this disaster. It will also take decades to restore the international goodwill that has been destroyed in a couple of months. Alas!
Great
Good for China to not let them be played by the facist regime in the US. Here in Europe we are also fed up with the derogatory attitude that the new government displays and so are many of the former allies of the US. The idea that the US has about being the center of the world, while that time has already passed.
Greedy boeing is complaining😂 oh...wait what happened to all boeing whistle blower!
No worry, Trump will take all👍
There is at least a 5 year waiting time to get a new Boeing 737 Max from order to delivery (and up to 8 years for a new Airbus A320 Neo) so any jets not purchased by China will be snapped up by others in no time at all.
That recall of the B737 probably saved Chinese lives.
Way to go dump
China is going to start building planes too.  Seems like the guy in the Oval Office over estimated how much the rest of the world is tired of American BS.  I was planning on vacationing in Tennessee but now I’m going to China.
Who cares about tariffs.
Pure genius! Manufacture a plane in China. Then "return" it to US because of tariffs. Boeing creates tariff free access to US markets using Chinese manufacturing.
EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP MADE THE SAME MISTAKE AS THE VENEZUELANS WHO VOTED FOR MADURO, AND NOW THE PRESIDENCY OF THE USA 🇺🇸 IS BEING RUN BY A GROUP OF FASCISTS, AND THE GOAL OF THIS FASCISTS THAT INCLUDES;;; THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, ELON MUSK, TRUMP AND HIS MAGA REGIME, IS TO DESTROY THE U.S. SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES TO CREATE AN AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT.
You guys, Cantwell, most of these comments are all from Leftists idiots and morons!  First off Boeing has YEARS of back orders of the 737 Max, secondly, other countries that are waiting for the 737 Max are biting at the bits to get these Chinese aircraft instead of waiting more time!  Your TDS, lies, half truths and not mentioning important facts just proves you morons are more for China than your own Country, you’d rather lie for China than admit what China has done to the world is simply indefensible!  You’re a pathetic Leftist network and nothing more!
So, it is the buying customer to pay the tariff? I thought it is US to pay the tariff if China poses a tariff.
Nice. This all happen because of stupid Trump 😂😂😂
Its ok China its only a shitty Boeing Max....
Boeing sucks....
LOL!
It even has the paint job done already😂
India says they want them. All good.
Yawnnnnnnnn.
China dosnt want your planes or anything else you have including the dollar, boohoo
Thanks to Trump for the disastrous economy and loss of jobs.
Yaah the us will cripple because of 1 man
Poland buy dont worry
Well at least Canadians don’t have to worry about paying their increased tariffs on US goods.  Their voluntary boycott has left no US goods for purchase in their marketplace.   Hey Boeing and the rest of America, are you tired of winning yet?
I did not know that a 737 had that kind of range.  In reality, it probably got returned and not put together correctly because China bought one, cloned it, and now there are dangerous Chinese knockoffs flying over the skies of China.
Trump is not worried..........he will blame the Muslims and start a war somewhere .......to fool the American public.........
Trump's policies are a mess!
Just know that they can stop delivery of parts used to produce those planes as well… all planes take a large amount of parts make around the world… now screwed by a felon in the WH, delusional, ignorant and a 6x bankrupt failed business toddler with a mind of an infant
There’s one person that you can thank, and you know who that is “Trump”. He’s all yours!!!
The dust always settles.
Trump's tariff war is well intentioned but misguided. The correct response to unfair trade tactics on the part of other countries was to treat those countries' products the way those countries treat US products. So, the CCP forces US companies to have a Chinese partner, give the Chinese partner full and unfettered access to all of the US company's IP, close all US manufacturing and transfer it to the Chinese partner, and once the Chinese partner is good at making the US company's products, the US company is kicked out of China. In response, Trump should have issued the same mandate for all CCP Chinese companies doing business in the USA. Tariffs don't work against such underhanded and targeted trade policies as those used against US companies by the CCP. Trump could also give export subsidies to US companies like other countries do. Trump could also institute a single payer healthcare system like most other advanced countries have.
Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
FAFO 😂😂😂😂 Have the day you voted for.
I GUESS EVERYTHING HAS TO BE RECALIBRATED.
Ironic that FOX played - and still plays - a major role in creating this insane situation to begin with. Tired of winning yet? If not, great news: This is only the beginning!
Lol
At least China won’t be sending the Soybean’s back. They aren’t buying any from the US. Well done Maga.
Indian airlines under tata group has expressed interest to take it.
Everybody wants to do business with USA  Sure
Trump will buy it  Make America poor again
Trump membuat china lebih mandiri untuk membuat pesawat sendiri....
You wanted it, you get it! Just claim to the orange clown!
Are the Trump supporters still tied of winning 😂😂😂😂
Suck on it Trump!! 😆 China 10 - USA 0
Trump is ruin the America
There planes cant even stay in the air
I'm tired of winning!!!
The new 💩 country.
Check the plane , probably has communication devices  spying hidden in aircraft . Not to far fetched, China has been hacking and disrupting airports around the world .
Look, we KNOW American products are crap, stop boasting about it already...
我们不只是退了波音公司的飞机，还有所有美国生产的大飞机零部件，动动脑子吧，为什么零部件也不要了？只是因为关税吗？
Aircraft demand for exceeds supply by a lot. If Boeing gives orders to other customers but not China, China cannot have enough aircrafts….
With the backlog of orders, these planes will sell FAST. India has already offered to buy any returns from China.
Bring back the China travel ban.
Stop dealing with china they are about to collapse
Wonder who is advising Trump..this is crazy..just 4 months ..he is in a mess.
America isn't Great even before all this happening Americans are brain washed that thinking America is Great
🇨🇦Incorrect you can buy US wines.   This isn’t America we have choices as citizens and have chosen to exercise them.
China realized they can make them in house. IP protection ? WTO ? International law ? Who cares ?
Thanks FOX. Good reporting.
Let China build their own, they've stolen all our other technologies anyway including military.
HOW THE HELL THEY WILL HAVE SELF-DESTRUCTING PLANES?? WHAT A SHAME!
There is a saying that goes... Who laughs last laughs longest !!!😂😂😂😂😂😂  😂😂  Trumps tarriff war backfired on him 😂
Of course they are returning US deliveries. Did anyone actually believe China is willing to accept the tariff situation ? They are independent from US goods.
Boeing IS Not good enough. 0ut! 😅
FJB
😂😂😂
感谢美国，让我们与欧洲朋友更近😊
Boeing build crap and dangerous "flying" pieces of plastic
Just wait until until the shelves become empty and hire prices hit. We haven’t even scratched the service on damage these tariffs will do. Just imagine 250 percent tax on every one in your house hold. Including kids. God help us.
Winnnnnniinnnnggggggg
Keeping & return manufacturing in the USA is critical to job growth.  China is struggling economically and can’t afford to lose US purchasing power.
Has to break eggs to make omelettes. But we'll be fed anyway
Well, maybe refusing delivery of a 737 Max is not a bad idea anyway...
Omg xiamen air
China now runs the show. A US suicidal train crash in slomo
Going Going Boeing ……bust!!!
China will buy more Airbus
Back booked for years. Next customer will want it
Now that is what I call a good plan coming together. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
China'a loss and another airlines gain, another airline will buy it, all good
i dont know why any american should care what planes china has
India is going to buy them so it’s a win win for America and India
I like chines bot reality😂😂😂 They can write..but can't sell any products and this is just beginning of truly communist China 😂😂😂
Hahahaha those Chinese “peasants” are sending a strong message to the American Hillbilly 😂😂😂😂
MAGA!!! WINNING!!? 😂😅
Disatisfied client due to poor service & RV
Lo
The Boeing returned, but China never expect Trump to back down. Because China do not care no more.
china c919 no one buy 😂😂😂😂
So again, Canada is OK charging tarrifs on American imports but, not the other way around?
A Boeing jet returns to the US not losing any parts? Amazing...!
In Europe we applaud Trumps policies! Why because he’s destroying the US economy with his stupid tariffs. Airbus is loving it and Boeing is slowly dying along with the US car industry. You voted for trump, made your bed now lie in it. 😅
They wont say it out loud, but there is a new policy in place. The policy is buy US last...
Maybe izrael will buy all those planes???
All America has to do as a people is to fire Mask from office and replace Trump ASAP. Look at what lies and bigotry have done to the British & the American people. Sad sad sad… This is sad to watch, the US & the UK, are no longer great bcz of racial disparities and tariffs. Lies and bigotry
This is a big punch in the teeth...
Even if the tariffs are dropped your regime has made the world, including all the ones who used to be allies, hate you. You don’t do business with countries that stab you in the back.
So much winning...
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
China has the right to defend itself
make China Great Again
Probably has all sorts of surveillance and spy equipment on it
The chinese weren't paying for those bolts on the door
It will get worse
Trump’s tariff policy is going down in history as the most self defeating policy in US history.
Great Revision, send it back
sell it to Air India
Good News for India
China dodged a bullet by returning Boeings....those things are death traps
I’m a Trump supporter but he has lost it.
I'm sure the airplane won't be hard to sell
Everybody feeling good about the pain we all must endure?
yeah... the Chinese peasants don't have money now 😎
Canadian here! We love MAGA & Trump tariff. It’s only fair and CREATE millions of American Jobs for blue collar workers/ engineers. I wish we have MCCA too 😢😢
Rest of the world look for alternatives ❤
Have the day you voted for!  - Love and kisses from the penguins of Heard Island 🐧🐧🐧
Good news
Imagine pissing off you biggest client for example let’s say Walmart, they account for 70% of you yearly income. One day you decided piss them off and they withdrew your contract, now you rely on the other 30% client from somewhere else. Trump, known for his previous failed business. I also blame JD Vance for calling Chinese people peasants who made most of his stuff including his eyeliner.
US thinks like they're the center of the world
What’s the point? China can manufacturer these planes in no time 😂
China made its own jet better than boieng..
That is the problem where american capitalists and businessmen are complaining of losing their business profits when gigantic tariffs are in place. If you really want to decouple from china,then stop making dealings with them,that simple
🇯🇲 Trump is doing well. 🧐🇯🇲😅😂
I am Chinese, and I believe Trump is the greatest president of the United States. He has made the world a better place. Thank you to the wise American people for choosing him. I hope Trump continues to implement better policies and keeps delivering those philosophical speeches in public.If there really is a god in the world, he must be Trump. May Trump bless you.If you think I'm a bot, then Trump will send you to hell.
"In 2024, the US goods trade deficit with China was $295.4 billion"
Surely it’s good news for Boeing, they can sell it to an airline that’s been waiting months, possibly years for their new coffin.
Is America Great Again all you people who voted for the FELON,  LITTLE DONNIE NO BRAIN?
If Seattle didn't let the area become a huge trashcan, flooded with criminals that roam the streets with dozens of arrests, nobody would have voted for Trump. Instead.Seattle leaders made everyone's life worse/ more miserable so the only option was to elect Trump.
Awesome 🎉great news 🎉
boeing should fire all their employees that voted trump
You guys are just busy talking while the Chinese boss is visiting Asia countries. They play
Indian airlines need hundreds of aircraft. They may get earlier deliveries.
Huawei phones were returned from US ports back to China during the 1st Trump administration.  Now the Americans are getting a taste of it.
Here's some jet-powered FAFO for ya
They are not telling you that another nation's airline has stepped up to buy these.
Boeing involved in so many crashes. Who wanna buy? I dnt even wanna get on a boeing
Be careful there might be soies attached to it
I am concerned that the reporter claimed that the tariffs are stopping Boeing sales. The Chinese  tariffs on USA goods is making the prices more then before. No one is stopping the sales, the Chinese government is collecting the percentage for the Chinese communist party. Same all over the world every day. No new news here, just that the tariffs have become higher from the Chinese side.
Mericans been milking the world for 40 years time to pay up
Trump was sent by the devil ro destroy America. All he has succeeded in doing is destroying US economy, putting American businesses at risk overseas and giving more countries reasons to diversify away from US.
Wow this is the biggest case of foot in mouth disease of the century
What’s with the weird reporting here? You’re literally looking at the plane with the Chinese company logo on the side and still questioning if it’s it? Or saying it was the CA government when Canadian commenters are saying that the Canadian government didn’t impose anything? What the heck
Why re you selling lasers in China?  Traitor.
I didn't know those over sized boeing lawn darts has a return policy, that's cool.
MAGAts are you happy now?? Winning right?
7天无理由😂
Good the CCP won't be able to reverse engineer and manufacture the jet for 25 cents on the dollar.
Probably the US will revert back to an agrarian society, manufacturing and trade are foreign concepts to the slob dictator Trump, the moron goof.
Politicians in Seattle are mostly communists from the democrat party.
Come on, please tell the whole true. China is not buying, other counties are beg to buy NOW.
you all voted for trump ni modo!!!!!!!!
Oh look.  The nation that just ended the lives of 7 million people with their engineered virus is now demanding respect.
give the airlliner a refund?!
No need to read all the comments to here : we all agree : America is fucked !
This is such BS!!  Boeing planes are returned regularly for inspections, upgrades and warranty replacement issue. There is no proof this plane was a China directed return. Don't believe everything the media tells you.
Good on you American! You all voted.
Trump lovers are happy now
Let 5hose drug addiction in Washington go to work to offset the loss of plane sale.
Making America Great Again. They don’t need anyone else, they have two lovely big oceans.
Trump!!!!!
lol another great deal brought to you from maga lol
US Dems politicians are now careless about the principles and know who is the US future enemies. The enemy has been controlled the government, school, states, business without any intervention. They included the leftist judges, lawyers will sell their souls to devil as long as they got the money or corrupted money. They support the criminals and illegal aliens cause they will illegal votes for them to continue the bleed the US to death.. if they won’t arrest the criminals the who will arrest them ….
SHAMAN AIR LMAO
😂
Guess he doesn’t have all the cards.
Trump is doing exactly what needs to be done for the success of our country
Commercial airplanes cost a lot of money. They figure significantly in the balance of trade.
Trump's ego is more important than American interest.
Do you think that 300 million lazy and indolent people can defeat 1.4 billion hard-working and disciplined people?
If Regan saw what Republicans have become... he'd turn in his grave 😕 They're no longer Republicans, just Nazi and Soviet agents.
😂😂😂...thanks...cheeto man...😂😂😂
oppsies
This is a non-story. Boeing has a huge backlog and US airlines will gladly accept those aircraft destined for overseas buyers if they don’t want them.
NO SE PREOCUPEN ESTADOUNIDENSES..LA EMPRESA.MEXICANA DE AVIACION.PODRIA COMPRAR UNA DOCENA DE ESOS BOEING.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stupid! Cina took that airplane and looked at everything in it now they will just copy it and call it something else!😂😂😂
Americans are like stepping in dog💩,avoid at any cost
Great. Give it to other companies who have a backlog of orders.
These are the consequences of choosing to do business with china.
Are we “Great” enough yet? Thanks Trump - what a god dam self inflicted nightmare
Are we winning yet Mr. President?
Ah yes its on the runway
Boycott everything USA. Don’t buy from or travel to USA
20 minutes later, hungry again? Trump has been a Russian spy for about 38 years and counting. An ex-KGB chief: “In 1987 I worked in… the KGB of the USSR in Moscow… our department recruited the 40 year-old businessman from the USA, Donald Trump, nicknamed ‘Krasnov’.” That’s when Trump starts buying full-page ads attacking NATO. “Putin is doing a great job of outsmarting our country.” He says. Steele report: Russian operatives gathered damaging video evidence of perverted sex acts of presidential candidate in 2013, for blackmail. Mueller said “There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election.” Trump campaign had more than 140 contacts with Russian operatives, and Trump attempted to obstruct justice at least ten times. Campaign chair lied about then finally admitted to sharing info with Russian spy. Trump, ignoring US intelligence said: “…Putin, he just said it wasn’t Russia. I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Secret meeting in Trump Tower with Russkies. Jared attempts to set up secret back channel to Russia in the Russian embassy. Trump to NATO member on prospect of Russian attack on their country “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump: “If Putin likes Donald Trump… That’s called an asset…” Yeah, a Russian asset. FBI chief Kash Patel was paid $25,000 to appear in anti-FBI video by Russian backers. “The love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it” Trump said of January 6 rioters, some of them cop-killers… “Russia if you’re listening…” “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily…” Yes, they own a seditious, treasonous felonious American president. Where do you think all those top secret docs in the bathroom ended up? Anonymous says they have evidence the election was hacked for Trump, using Starlink... Whistleblower at NLRB says 15 minutes after DOGE got busy in NLRB, Russia tried to log in, with DOGE passwords, via Starlink... Even before whistleblower filed complaint, he was threatened, along with drone footage of himself... All allegedly…
A Trump bashing hit piece of so-called "news" especially since Maria Cantwell was present!
The communist party never believes win-win , they may pretend to be nice when they are weak. Their ideology is always for fighting brutly and dominating the world.
The cargo was fortune cookies 🥠..which china doesn't need 💉🧠😵‍💫
Even Fox cant defend this now lol
Wait?! This is a Fox affiliate news station reporting this? Damn things are really bad! 😅
Perhaps *now* people will understand how Trump bankrupted *casinos* ! Time to add America to the the list - Trump Taj Mahal, Trump’s Castle, Trump Plaza Casinos, Trump Plaza Hotel, Trump Hotels & Casinos Resorts, Trump Entertainment Resorts, Trump Steaks, GoTrump, Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Mortgage, Trump The Game, Trump Magazine, Trump University, Trump Ice, The New Jersey Generals, Tour de Trump, Trump Network, yada, yada, yada ...
Checkmate! Trump is about to wave the white flag, he lost the trade war he started. It’s absolutely glorious watching the self-proclaimed 'master negotiator' get humiliated. Now it’s time to turn the tables on the US. They've been riding on unfair trade advantages for decades, lecturing everyone else while hollowing out their own credibility. Let’s make them taste a little of the medicine they’ve been dishing out to the rest of the world.
Looks like President Xi is in no hurry to make a deal with Trump.
Trump is not trustworthy to negotiate with any country, he changes his mind off and on, he is governing by his emotions at the moment.
Good. Welcome to the find out phase. Y''all voted for this sh*t. Enjoy. Love from Australia.
How satisfying! Americans are getting their wonderful creations back, thanks to their super-intelligent President!
If the plane was goint to pick up freight why was it a passenger air craft.  Freigters do not have windows
Yall asked for this and didnt warn/educate others about tariffs. Now, fuck around and find out.
And its just been reported that Trump is lowering tariffs with China. Boeing will never have access to the worlds largest aviation market. The damage done😮 Mexico's trade volume has gone up 40% and President Sheinbaum is like "we're in no hurry for trade deal"😂
Time for Boeing to move to Mexico or Canada
This dictator is going to destroy America.
all this trump this and trump that and not one person with any authority is doing one thing about it...
So much winning
I’d bet they keep at least one from all ordered.   Once they dismantle it. Reverse engineer it and steal all intellectual property they will just make their own. Not the first time it’s happened
I would be careful what you say here, you might get deported. Didn't you see what Greenland looks like?
It’s a win for the US. Keep our technology safe
This is just going to get worse in Trump's mind it time to make Russia Rich again.
We'll, you wanted a trade war. Boeing depends on foreign orders. They were already in some rough water and this could be the end. The country that invented aviation will no longer sell commercial aircraft. Airbus is happy.
😊
The US needs China a lot more than China needs the US.  Trump has no idea.
A Chinese tea company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last week.  An IPO that's now worth over $400 billion.  Meanwhile, the dictator of China is returning contracted aircraft and threating nations against doing business with the United States.  Remind us all which nation is striving for FREE TRADE.
Welcome to the new world,Trump is teaching China how to be better and more independent from USA
What a shame
So that was China airlines Liberation Day? Liberated from Boeing planes.
Look up Comac C919, an aircraft designed and built specifically in anticipation for geopolitical nonsense like this. All Trump did was give them an excuse to rip off the band aid from the first time they were cut.
Airbus in Europe will get busy
Should've invested in India instead of China. At least there is Democracy there.
I guess the pilots didn't wear suites so the Chinese sent them back to teach them respect.
Many many people choose and request stores to stock items that are not made in the USA. Why stock tarrif items when we have many free trade partners? I buy items from within my own country as well as from our trading partners other than USA. We choose how to spend our money and we choose to purchase within our own country first, then trading partners that trade fairly but also have not harmed/harming us like the USA. It is not hard to understand the whys. I don't plan on changing what I'm doing, its benefiting me and my country and partners that are being harmed as well. It is growth in the right direction.
Boycott from Canada from the threats of 51st state has massively affected USA financially in a big margin.
Anyone who actually believes that Trump is  very smart is actually declaring how stupid they are.
Canadian government mandate? False information  It is voluntary decision by local liquor control boards. And the support of the majority of Canadians to not purchase American products
USA last at the bottom!! We didn’t mandate Federally each Province decided and Canadians agreed The citizens of Canada from the ground up are not buying US products Anything but US BECAUSE Mr T wants our water minerals oil educated citizens  But not our universal healthcare or our 6 month yo one year maternity leave  Or our subsidies on daycare and dental health Canada Strong❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Merci
From a non-American. The trade is gone, the goodwill is gone, the friendship? Was it ever there. America's standing in the world is gone. Thankfully I am not an American. The loss of America is sad and highly regrettable. I personally know many lovely people there. But we will tighten our belts and re-organise and decide who we will, and who we will not trade with.
What's the tariff on moonshine
Mr. Wig ... what did you do! LOL
What exactly did you experct? Pissing everbody off and now complain? This will not end well for the US.
Yes, Make America Great Again!
China will be suffering even more ! U.S should continue raising our tariffs to China up to 300% . Boycott all Chinese products ❤
They should check this plan for software sabotage.

Deported an airplane 😂
If China returns jets then does that mean China will reject parts to fix aircraft from Boeing grounding China's commercial jets until they can be repaired.

Republicans think the US is 92% of the trading world and can dictate terms to the world. They’re finding out the hard way that the US is a tiny fraction of the global market. We just happen to be the largest economy out of all countries, but the global economy is massive.

Best commentary section I've read in a while 😂 Lauren is the best she always delivers 🎉
Aw gee. Didn't MAGArians know that countries fight back when you screw them over? See, trying to put China in its place is not that bad of an idea, but Trump decided to take a swing at every nation out there, including his allies. Stupid idea. He should get his priorities straight. If he wants to take on China, he should have met with his NATO allies, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand and had talks with them on how to do a coordinated action against China. Instead of cooperation, he decided to sever all ties and soon MAGArians will wonder where their empire went... guess what happens when you piss off the allies that are the foundation of your global power. You're about to find out.

Great tips, thanks for sharing!

This is only the beginning. GDP has already retracted. Total collapse of Tourism, liquor sales, crops, higher education tuitions aviation, defensive contracts and services will be next.

Jack Daniel's regrets the loss of 1% of their sales going to Canada 🇨🇦. 🍸 🧉 🥛 🍷
Malaysian Airlines already expressed strong interest in buying all these airplanes, actually there are strong demand for Boeing airplanes. Malaysia wants them badly because otherwise they have to wait for a long queue for Boeing to deliver. It is clear that 75 million American people and their beloved DEM and media outlets (aka disinformation outlets) do not like any good things happened under Bush (remember how they called Bush Hitler many years ago 😂) or Trump or any other Republican presidents...they just don't want people know the true or full picture...they do seem to hate America or at least hate half of the American people who are Republicans or voted Republicans...the No. 1 principle of their "reporting" is to damage Trump's or Bush's American as much as they can... I am not an American but i can see thru this very easily and cannot help wondering why the Americans still try to keep the union when they hate each other so much 😂 why not just split into two countries and so these media people can have a peaceful and relaxing life instead of working so hard every day to call Trump (previously Bush and future Republican presidents) Hitler or idiots 😂

For China and Chinese business in America, this is very bad. You can talk a lot, but in the long term, this is good for America. The US buys more from China than everyone else combined. So we'll see. Trump is doing everything right.
Why does no one at Fox News ask why Russia's biggest enemy in the USA Timothy Haugh (director of NSA) was fired by Trump? Russia the only country besides North Korea that has not been given a tariff. Russia that invaded another country and the country that made no concessions at the peace talks but now gets more than two-thirds of what it wrongly claims from Trump!?! And Fox, please also find out why the average American is allowed to bleed for these measures. Why are luxury European mega yacht yards excluded (you know the ones with the Billionaire yachts?) Fox News you can now choose on which side of history you want to end up.
US and it alliances must stop  idoing business with China and isolate China.
That will teach the Chinese a lesson. Oh wait..... LOL
Trump is so fuc**** STUPID! Only Stupid will buy American when Trump and his clusterf*** cabinet secretaries are in office.

Great policy. Now USA have more planes to fly around, more wines to drink. Big loss for China! 😂
These tariffs will kill the mid size and small businesses. Trump is helping his billionaire eliminate any potential competitors.

This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Boy, you can certainly tell this is a LIB Seattle station, what a bunch of LIB TNUC comments,  if you don't know what a tnuC is, look in the mirror!!  stnuC!!!
1:50 What is he wearing, a girly headband?
Your government is out of control, poor planning, and the lack of understanding of how international trade really works. This is crashing the world economy, and hurting not only US citizens, but people around the world.
China don't buy LNG from the USA anymore.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
This gave me chills… in the best way
Wa. state is a Communist paradise,   .
Damaged goods , tainted by usa ignorance  and bull
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
China learned from Trump last time. They are going to school him and America is going to pay.
Nobody wants USA products
The USA voted for MAGA Trump enjoy.
ok, I understand your complaint... but who did you voted for? There are consequences to election
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Well done China Return to Sender. Airbus is better. You got what you want and people are not going to be bullied into buying American sub standard items when there is better out there on the market... Now they are spreading their horizons and that has affected you... Enjoy your making a America great yet again. Maybe one day you will be respected in the world but i think that is a very long time coming.
I can t stop smiling watching this
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
Did Trump mean “make America great or grate again?” I’m actually confused by the outcome of it all
Trump is making China greater again first time was in 2016
ROTFLMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trump is only the result and true face of a broken, racist, ignorant, xenophobic, Homophobic, low IQ society. The USA has always been like this, the difference is that now, they have a president expressing publicly how they have ALWAYS felt, thought and how they've ALWAYS been.
Woohoo, Trump winning continues!!!
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Recession history repeats it self!
vote for Kamala and the USA will be in a deep  resesion... 😅😅😅😅
Is Joseph Goebbels writing Fox (News) ?...Fox (News) gives a political viewpoint..NOT actual new... Fox ( News )  has been removed from Sky News channels in Europe. It's not even to be found in the comedy channels.
😮
US use this plane to deport illegal immigrants or undocumented Chinese.  Detained by ICE.
Your Trump is a menace.
Serves you right. We have stopped buying American stuff in the UK. Even their Coffee shops are empty here. We all hate trummpy and that rude Vance
China government ordered not to accept Boeing planes not only due to Tariff  also due to the current economic condition when there is less demand for air travel in China. They can simply repaint it and deliver it to India.
This is normal . The market rearange itself. And for Boeing there are some people happy , because there is a long line of buyers waiting for their plane. Without Chinese they will receive their plane sooner. Any tarrifs are in the USA advantages. Because it was a big deficit in relationships bwith china
Good news for Airbus.
Are we Winning yet?
I hope that plane wasnt sitting on the runway as that's very dangerous for those trying to land.
Sometimes I just wonder if presidents work for themselves and/or their buddies, or they work for all the citizens because if their decisions affect mostly the citizens negatively, then why make those decisions?
MAGA Trump
So have Americans figured out that Trump is an economically illiterate conman yet or what? Vladimir Putin must be very happy with the work Trump has done for him destroying the American economy.
Very Good 👍🏻
...saying they will use their own batteries!
Thanks Trump  So much winning
Stupid leaders. Get Trump and his trolls out of power.
Boeing failed to pay the 125% Chinese tariff.  So China rejected the Boeing plane delivery.  Only brain-dead MAGA voters don't understand why.  👎
Wondering China doesn’t pay cour tariffs?
As an American, this man knows better. EVERYONE knows Canadians are boycotting us as they should be. The government mandated nothing. The citizens did this. Just like everyone else in the world. Are we great again? No. Oh right. 1930s America is what we are aiming for. When old rich white guys ruled.
But wait, there’s more… 😂😂😂
China laughing all the way to the top and the bank. Learn from history, tariffs were tried once snd they failed miserably. .
Ditch %US, ditch global %terror
Signing  contract with usa is just a joke, because thier peasants government can change the terms whenever they want
Who would fly Boeing anyway😂
Oh no.. ONE PLANE.. you pathetic loosers need to be in charge of nothing..
Thanks Trump
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How's that for America first 😂. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. MAGA trying to spin it like it's good for us, and just short term pain right now. Pffft who is still eating their baloney sandwich?
Foreign Airlines are highly unlikely to place any orders with Boeing, whilst Mango-Muzh is in ghe White Houss. Airbus already has 2,600 more orders on the books, than Boeing has.
Laughs in Airbus 😆
Trump making America great still 😂 hahaha
And there are still a bunch of idiots that think that everything is gonna be alright  and the winning is around the corner with the tariffs.  The only thing that's around the corner is desolation.
lol. The us is broke. You used to be woke. Always a joke. 😂
The orange moron economics!
Não quiseram o Trump como presidente??? Aí está, agora chorem. Trump 🤡🤡🤡💩💩💩💩
This is only understandable.
Can’t Boeing do what Chinese store owner does? Once you buy it, there is NO return! 😂
Just what Boeing needs .
The World, China, Europe, Mexico, Canada all deciding the US cannot be trusted with foreign policy changes by the hour. We are choosing to trade with trusted countries and allies. Made in America brand is not an option any more. Not even tourism or air travel through. Trump has isolated the US and use are on your own. Canada canceling F 35 order and purchasing military jets from Sweden, subs from France, Tanks from Germany, Radar system from Australia. Oil and gas reroutes to other countries. Elbows up.
World does not revolve around china, it’s time to discover new markets and establish a new relationships.
Stop buying and supporting China products!!
My president is dumb.
We ceased purchasing all USA made products. Even though all our machinery is US made, we will be buying all parts via China and at 10% the price they were from the US, copies, but very good if not better than the OEM USA made versions.
Non-returnable after removed from packaging and flew.
Boeing gets a win with a 737 Max flying to China and back again without a door falling off and MCAS anti-stall software not flying it into the ground.
Retailers decided to protest American goods! Good for them. Everyone stop bowing to that piece of crap disgrace of a vice president trump!  And on another note , how are jobs unemployment going down when he’s gutting the federal government? OH YHATD RIGHT HE LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING!!!!
Cluck cluck cluck  not too much said about the price of eggs cluck cluck cluck  You be better off with one them as president
DO UNTO OTHERS WHAT YOU WANT THE SAME DONE UNTO US
Buy Airbus shares now
As promised, Trump will make USA great again. If not this century, maybe next.
😂 MAGA🎉
Trump could well hold the record for the number of businesses that he has crashed. Well done Donald, way to go.
Send it to India and we will buy for sure
Do different things. One thing you'll do have to understand is is that this particular situation you I've got to do something about. because the problem is, is that you're now going to deal with not just tariffs. You're going to deal with China coming into the brink of wanting to be taking over your particular sector. I have been to the Boeing Seattle Museum myself. You have got to understand there's a gigantic delta museum that I need to visit over there in Atlanta, GA. The reason I say this is because you have got to go back to the old ways of making planes. The reason I'm saying this is if not, China will literally start taking over your market share, because the problem is right now, they can't even get any of the products in.
Fifty-five million dollars returned to Seattle, not including fuel. Well done, Mr. President. A great deal for America. Is this how trade works?
Return to sender. A very visual way to see the carrot and his taxes in effect making america a laughing stock...again. Hope boeing paid a tariff to import a exported plane
Blind fools only see the short term . They can’t even imagine the victory around the corner .
"If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders." - George Carlin.
Good. America needs to learn ha Trump is a liar and a failure. He is only successful because idiots perceive him to be. Hes gone bankrupt 6 times.
Good for USA! Blame it to Trump!
Is tRump going to put a 245% tariff on the Boeing? It just came from China.😂
The world no longer wants maga made crap.
IT'S ONLY THE BEGUINNING
I am sure there will be many US hospitals will close soon because they can't get medical supplies. Americans don't realised that majority of medical supplies come from China. Americans who are dependent to  dialysis treatment to live and those cancer patients having chemo therapy treatment will be the first group of Americans that will suffer first due to close down of hospital facilities. Hospital medical supplies/equipments like syringes, needles, dressings, sutures, dialysis lines, intravenous lines..etc all sources from China. All the best America...
we winning yet?
Democrats are dependent on China's money.
When Fox News reports on our government failures, then you know it’s not a beautiful thing.
Good for Airbus in europe. Thank you Donald
It's a Boeing max...  How was it even ordered?
You have got to start taking care of your mental health. My cousin in the southern part of China, his wife works at a hospital, people can't even get an appointment with the mental health doctor. If we are not going to take bigger strides. We better start taking bigger strides. Because your state is notorious for mental health issues.
You're gonna have more problems with the cars because you are a logistically positioned in a location where you have import, export rights, where before vehicles have to come in, you are in the primary position because I've been to Seattle before. Love your state. that your state is very nice place to be. But the problem is, is you have mental health issues. That's probably higher than most states that Starbucks cannot fix those problems. See the issue is this. There's a brain to gut connection and here in Texas, they're doing research on the Vargas nerve at Baylor University. The only reason they're doing this is because I managed to go over there and give them 400 pages of medical journals.
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Who remember the bush jr era
BOEING Made in America,  and parked in America  Make America Fly Again...
You have got to hire the right people, in my opinion. I have never seen this level of blatant disregard for the fact that you don't understand anything. And this is not to insult the senators or the committee. You have to understand those cargo things are do not just come back and forth, back and forth. It's not that simple. They have to clear customs as well.
Can US companies survive for another 3 years 9 months??
Can somebody tell me the name of a company rulled by trump that is a sucess?  Thank you.
Other countries would be willing to buy those airplanes but the main issue lies in the configuration and options installed on said airplanes. Having Boeing Change those options and config is costly.
I was also the cargo risk manager for Ingersoll Rand in manufacturing. The reason the cargo is being pulled back is because the thing is that it's not the tariffs that there's the problem. It's the logistical handling of the barges. That is correct. The problem is that if the barge is somewhere else in the ocean where it needs to do some type of maintenance or turn around, you're going to have a large problem. Carnival Cruise Line for whatever reason, never responded to me when I apply for the position of the being their insurance manager.  The damn thing the crate for cargoes down it has to be weighed at the port. So now that you have all these ungodly tariffs, I was the Ingersoll Rand risk manager for cargo. So therefore, every time I was around Thanksgiving, people always called me because the cargo got stuck in the port of France.
I’ll take it, if it’s paid for and the customer doesn’t want it.
We Canadians love Americans, not much your president. Long live King Charles II , yes we are a monarchy and we a have a king 👑. You have Trump. Good luck 🍀
I love all the far east commentors on here. Seems suddenly China has access to the internet.
I don't understand how a finance manager who eventually moves himself into the aviation gas fuel sector can fully understand that the scope of where he worked before, when in reality you can't even figure out who the aviation risk manager is. You were in the same elevator as the rest of us. Even the woman who has Pam Smith, who's now moved on to liquefied natural gas as a manager. She was the one that I did the training for. So the fact that you can't seem to figure out what we're in the same elevator together about the fact I was the aviation risk manager, Phillips 66 sold a refinery in Trainer Pennsylvania to Delta Airlines to hedge cost.  Lord help us.
this is what happens when you let a convicted felon run the show. once trump is gone things go back to normal.  guess congress needs to grow a spine
This is a big problem, especially in the avgas sector. I know I saw a professional that has moved on to the aviation fuel side as a finance manager, but the problem is this person will not respond to any signs of life. The thing is that I have worked with him on the Treasury floor when I was at Phillips 66. Man did not figure out who was supposed to do what, and he was there for his executive MBA. I still don't understand how, a finance manager can't seem to figure out Who does what on the aviation floor, especially when it comes down to the Phillips 66 side on the Treasury floor. The man was always positioned from the Bloomberg Index. and he knew that I reported to the assistant treasurer at the time. So, the thing is, that I'm not particularly certain. I am very convinced that I should even think about the possibility of pursuing an executive MBA. especially since I am also a Texas Longhorn.
Love it. Thank Donald for this
The US doesnt realise that China accounts for a large number of the 40,000 planes, You can kiss good bye to those orders
Boeing helped put Trump in office....enjoy the flight.
You will got more problems than you know. The only reason I say this is because I was the aviation risk manager for. Phillips 66. I told you. I told you that this was just going to be not just a channel to educate you, but that channel to educate you because I was the risk manager for aviation back when I was working in energy. The problem I think you're going to have right now is the fact that you have two problems is not to say that Seattle Boeing is homegrown. departs have to come from other places. In the history of aviation manufacturing I was mentored by Steve Safflin, the chief aviation pilot. When I was at Phillips 66 the problem is that a lot of the parts used to be handmade.
This is 100% Trump's doing. Many of us in the US didn't vote for Trump. We are simply subject to his policies and have no recourse for the next 4 years. Congress is filled with OLD and corrupt officials that only care about enriching themselves and maintaining the very situation that put us here.
Make America Great Again 😂
I don't wanna hear about stories we want  proof
Trump is secretly working for Airbus.
I guess China has more cards to play than we thought.😆😆
On the runway?? 😂😂
Theres a high probability the planes engines will not have coins tossed into them by a superstitious Chinese passenger wishing good luck for the flight.
Potentially lucky boein passengers,  they now stand some chance of surviving a flight, boeing aircraft, especilally the max versions have a reputation as a death trap.
Bad news for Boeing with China returning planes and canceling the contracts. I guess Canada's did the same thing canceled their contracts with Boeing. I guess a lot of people are. Boeing is losing everywhere. Good grief, maybe Trump will bail them out with his thousands of f-47s that he's buying
Parked on the runway……….
It must suck to be a septic yank.😂
Is one of those Boeings being returned Xi's Air Force  1?? Didn't think so
2:45  TYPICAL FOX FAKE NEWS.  People are not buying American product because they are Voting with their pocket.  You Voted for Trump, don't blame other's for spending their money wisely. Heck even in The UK we are ignoring your stuff.  You elected a tin pot dictator and his cronies and fail to realise your mistakes.  You can't blame the rest of the world for calling you out on your nonsense.  Had Europe dealt with Hitler properly back then things would not have gotten so bad.  Folk learnt from that mistake hence the kickback y'all crying about.
What do we expect. No sales no money no jobs
Hello Airbus! 🙂
China is no kidding 😂😂 trump just keep on bullshit 😂😂
Dont they know it cost money to repaint and change all the electrical equipment and label.You're going to lose money
Another big win for MAGA 😂😂😂
Trump, MAGA ant the USA just keep winning and winning.
Great job, Fox!!!
Is this a real fox channel,? Ain't they a pro_trump media?
0:35 Parked on the runway?
America is getting great with slapping of returning cargoes,,the Warehouses are full,,
sure someone will buy it.
Guess this casino called America is getting the trump treatment. Bankruptcy can’t be far.
Actually it's a more complicated situation,the plan was not returned by China. The plan was sent from boeing US to boeing China for painting, and boeing China should finish the import procedures in 30days and then it can sell it to China's airlines if every thing goes right. But now, it comes with 125% tarrif, and any customer in China won't possible to absorb the cost, so boeing decide to return the plan to US before the 30 days' dead line. Technically, neither China government nor the original customer has anything to do with the decision of returning the plan. boeing will wait to see if there will be a turning in the tarrif situation.
Southwest , Delta is still waiting for 737-8 max
If the trades are shrinking, then no need for so much $, the US government has to swallow the over printed dollars, and drives prices up.
Maybe this is a good thing EVERYONE relies too much on chinese cheap crap goods too. Time to make american goods again...... BUT there's only derelict buildings now that are left to fall too. Another pipe dream of TRUMPS! 😅
Don't worry ! Trump will buy it from you - Air Force two!
The US can just borrow more money from peasants, so they can buy these planes themselves.
But the funniest part is Trump keeps calling it the worst trade deal ever. But he forgets that Mexico and Canada are using the exact trade deal Trump made in 2018.. God you people. You can tell by the comments that this is FOX news.
TRUMP IS TRYING DO THINGS GO LOCALLY, CUT OFF CHINESE GOODS & GO LOCAL, CARS MADE LOCAL........BUT..... IT WOULD BE EXCELLENT IF THAT DID HAPPEN BUT ITS JUST A PIPE DREAM HES PUSHING. THIS SHOULDVE HAPPENED WAY BEFORE WW2 NOT NOW
Trump, the "deal maker," is like business repellent. Turns out being a nasty human being isnt good for global business. Even if America's think an a hole in the Whitehouse is okay, the world disagrees. This was an adjustment that was coming anyway.  The US officially became "too big for its britches."
Its funny reading all the Americans commenting about Canada and they don't need them.  But Americans are not smart enough to realize that 38 States largest trading partner is Canada. Tennessee and Kentucky's largest trade partner for bourbon  WAS Canada. .      If you remove oil from the trading then the USA would actually have a Surplus...
What is all the excitement about. Just democrat garbage from anti American politicians and West Coast states. The truth, Both Airbus and Boeing have at least 10 year backlogs for their jets, Any sales that are rescinded and planes returned will be scooped up by airlines in que for new airplanes.  A new paint job is all they need and off they go to an airline that will feel they won the jackpot.
In reality the Chinese can source the majority of their products they get from America through other countries, you can't say that about America.
So what wtf
Goodluck to you gay country😂
Did they (America) not imagine that the imposed tariffs would not spark a major reaction with nations outside of the US ? As ever, the arrogance & hubris of this current White House administration is unsurprising - & more ironic that it is reported by Fox News, Seattle. I'm just awaiting the  coup de grâce.
厦门航空付全款了吗？😢
17000 workers from Boeing being laid off Hmmmm and now the Emerits are cancelling their shipments as well to go with AirBus
America first means America Alone. 7 billion people on Earth and only 370 million in America. As Dumpy says, “You don’t have the cards”! FAFO!
Things from the US are not necessities for Chinese and many other countries in Asia. They are always luxury. These people can certainly live without them which they been doing for a very long time. Meanwhile Americans are depending on goods from this countries like minerals and other cheap stuffs. So who’s gonna last?  Certainly not The USA
all this winning by the Trumptards is amazing
To all the MAGA MORONS — I think you suck. You voted to destroy our country.
Boeing hasnt been quality in over a decade. They should have been out of business years ago. Trillions in governement contracts and still failing.
Trump -   “ America is strong. We are strong, economically, militarily and intellectually and superior. We are genius and ingenious”.      President XI   “ So is China. We just talk and show off and brag like you”.
Boeing should sue but leaders ignoring laws and making there own is pure lawlessness...
Make America friendly again
USA is" finding out"
🇨🇦Good youre starting to wakeup! Look I visited USA all my life & THAT comment can get me in a jail ....not coming back & good luck 👍
Too expensive with 125% tariff. US cannot sell their products anymore.
How are you liking all that greatness slump voters? Isn’t it wonderful?
The cdn gmt needs to NEGOTIATE not fight! the cdn gmt has been charging the usa 250% tariff on certain items for many years!!!
And don’t send anything back to be Copied again.
As a Canadian I am so sorry this is affecting many of our friend’s businesses and lives to the south.  Our boycotts are aimed at the Trump administration, not the good people of America, (except MAGAs who are responsible for Trump).  🇨🇦 🇺🇸
Thx Donny 😂😂 keep going same way
🤣This drama is so funny .... Emerican  account for only  ~4%  of w0rld p0pu1ation . why the96% need to f0110w ? Democracy ?
the Plane dont wear a suit...
BOEING is finished, Airbus is replacing them. You voted for it, now live with it.
Sell those to Indian's they don't even produce condoms 😂
Bridge  , still better than pay 145% tariff to the gov . There are already  second Boeing jet returns to U.S. from China
Lots of US airlines ready to take this jet.  New paint, maybe reconfigured and sold
Enjoying the clown show. Go Donald
There are already  second Boeing jet returns to U.S. from China
israel +trump make usa speed down this is the hell
Decreasing bookings are just the tip of the iceberg. Growing dislike of and diminishing trust in America are the real iceberg. Arrogant Americans, like german fascists then, will learn a valuable lesson.
Some countries (aka India) should buy this plane at deep discount, all it needs is a paint job.  Last time I checked Boeing has orders it can not fulfill for next 10 years . What’s the trouble ?
now the ? is the plane a import from china or not?
Seeing Democrat leaders use the work of Communist to attack Americans isn’t as surprising as you’d think.
The art of the F**kwit
Echoing the comments made by Canadians - the Australia government has not officially mandated "anything" (positive or negative) to do with American goods. However many retail outlets are ceasing to stock US goods (especially alcohol related) in response to hostile customer sentiment, and a staggering decrease in sales. One notable liquor retailer in Australia simply said "there is no reason to waste shelf space when customers are clearly not interested".
It is all Fascist Trump Fault
In all fairness the US has a shortage of planes and a huge waiting list to fulfill orders due to the backlash last year.  They'll just sell it to a U S airliner. No problem you guys just like living in unreasonable fear for no reason.
Make trump pay for fuel and sue trump for lost wages and payment failure
big deal. The end result will be fair trade.  USA !
my 401k has become 201k now...
Are you great again yet ?
I'll give ya $10 for it
Airbus has got to be happy with Trump! 😂
No problem, Trump said US needs nothing from anyone! Apparently he needs to sell nothing either ! Well done !! lol do you know how stupid you look ? And it just started …..
Well complete India orders we have ordered over 500 planes
Are you Amerikan ,!!??
Now customers who has been waiting many years to receive their planes can now buy this plane, new paint make some adjustments to the customers needs then here you go! On the flip side the original buyer of this plane will have to wait in line to get another plane from a competing air craft builder.
Another liberal state whining about Trump? Shocker. They'd rather sell their soul to China for a quick buck.
This is what you'll get when you f**ked around with your clients!
Better ask Trump why.
Trump is a moronic clown flailing around in total ignorance. He has to go.
Americans asked for these tariffs! Stop complaining!!!!
They were just using Boeing to copy everything about the plane anyway
How come this fox channel is not saying this is great for America? Now Americans will have one more plane to travel 😂😂😂😂
From The Netherlands Europe. Yes, so China can also buy our Airbus planes. This all thanks to your "president". Also for defence. We will increase defence in Europe, but will spend this inside Europe. Arms production is being increased and the US is not longer regarded as a reliable ally.
Oh dear, what a shame.
Reject orders, plug up American ports, lost jobs, lost revenue, lost future for America with trump in the driver seat. Thanks to FOX the lies will continue to blind Americans. Good luck u der trump.
US the big bully. Forget that US is no longer strong like in the 90s.
America is getting Great again as the result of $hi* accumulation LOL
Trump's tariffs on full swing.
Get used to it maga idiots here in Europe there's lots of people boycotting american products and it's growing by the day.
An opportunity for aircraft painters though. One careful owner, good as new.
That denial must have been a painful business flop of the US. A Dollar 500 billion worth business denied.
This is new global world order reflection as told by sir jefry sacks
MAGAs have now lots of planes where they sit and pretend that they are on vacation 😂
And no one cares about the liberal lunatics of Seattle!
Don't do business with China!
Hail King Trump
舒服~，不要以為只有你們會制裁😅😅
Meanwhile Air India and Indigo airlines to all returned jets : Mine! Mine! Mine!
President Turnip
The plane did not wear a suite so the Chinese banned it. Such an insult.
A Typical communist country government, ordering certain products off the shelves because they know if they didn’t Canadians would actually buy American products.  This is a state forced boycott.  Obviously Canada has just become CCP (Canadian Communist Party.) Now I hear they plan on changing their names to  Chinada and the people want to be referred to as Chinadians 😂
Boeing, you should say thank you to trump and JD. US increased traiff at the first place, trump should know what is this going to happen after traiff increased.
Check it for bugs or other spyware
This is funny. This is what happens when you pull childish antics for weeks: Someone does one back to you because it seems it's the only language you understand.
Send to tata
keep begging son
The contrast between China and Rússia….Russia Stole all planes , just stay with them no payements!!!😂
So much winning...
LOL, Australian, KLM and 3 other international airlines has canceled Boeing and are now only buying Airbus.
Always winning 😂❤🎉
Surprised? What could you possibly expect from a professional bankrupter and his signal administration?
Trump is doing wonders for your economy crank up the soup kitchens 😅😅
dude, can i see the refund form they filed? just for study purposed
The US was already slipping into irrelevance,Trump just brought it forward 10 years.
China need our plane but they didnt figure it out？loooooool
I just saw a used boing (yes boing, not  for sale on fb marketplace. Must be this one
Digging a trap hole... and falling right into it.
well well.... How to take "heavy" decisions when you are NOT qualified for it. The most funny part here : USA imposed FREE TRADE to the rest of the world, decades ago.  withdrawal doesn't work at all....  Oh, and why on Earth do you think there are specialists for any precise subjects ?   Because you need to know and understand how the world works in order to take the less "bad" decision !!  Send an "estate agent" in order to find a solution to the Ukraine war... How do you really think it will end ?? ...Poorly, sadly.  Sometimes, we (rest of the world..) think that we are living in a "soap opera TV serial" with USA, right now...  Frightening , really !!
So buy American products!
I’m sure the waiting list from all other customers is long so another will receive theirs early!
China has their own planes now.. 😂
Trump & Co. does not make mistakes, Trump & Co. are mistakes!
U.s consume from china super cheaper product😊😊. China consume super highprice product from u.s😅. China won😊
🥱🥱🥱
Got what you voted for😅
Brit here, while this might seem amusing, the time is coming, because of Trump and his sycophants America will end.  The dollar is on its way out, Ford Gm etc have moved abroad and  Boeing thinking of doing the same. Vacations to the USA have dropped 70% and countries abroad have stopped their orders from the USA.  Its NOT good. Once this happens, companies  will not return nor holiday makers. As for me I wont return to the USA anymore after a friend was arrested at the airport and thrown in jail, no reason given, few days later allowed out and told to go back to the UK.  The only thing we can think of, is probably his remarks about Trump on social media.  Your country is no longer democratic, has a dictator running it and has become a place to avoid.

Probably just heard about the max’s safety concerns and the inadequate oversight from the FAA.
You people need to get over this. This will go won for a little while until things gets straightened out. Quit being so fucking greedy
Boeing 737 8Max is danger model, try  to avoid flying with this model!
Huh?
Buy American products
Wel Boeing will soon get another buyer for it  ,I'm sure one owner from new clearance corner 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is not about one plane....this is the start of a landslide for Boeing and the US manufacturing.  OK,  you don't depend on parts and materials from other countries (you can't) , you build the factory and have enough skilled staff (how many years it's going to take?), finally made a product (your cost will be through the roof by this point), then surprise surprise, there is a tariff waiting for you 🤣  Good luck with selling everything domestically!
Look at those Democrats cried for China!
Well, you voted him in, enjoy the fruits of his labor
Two can play the game. Trump should have known that
Who cares that CCCP sends a plane back?
No trade deals with evil commie China. 1776% tariffs on China!
Yipee! Happy & Prosperous times are coming to the mighty U.S. of A
Hope all countries send back everything that comes from Trump, the country of the USA. Shame on those who didn't vote for Trump, but you can blame your president and vice president. Hälsning från Sverige.
The plaines are full of Iphones.
Just wait for the unemployment numbers in the next coming months! 😂😂😂😂
😂
Trade is a two way street. America needs to realize that it is not the only so called "super power" in the world. America is now facing challenges from all over the world.
Who the fuck buys boeing over airbus?
Don't blame the Chinese. A lot of people are terrified of that flying coffin called 737Max😂😂😂
😂
We don’t need Boeing
You slapped 250% tariff. What did you expect? China has alternatives to Boeing.
As with tourists, and other visitors, the USA can expect far less investment $ from outside going into the USA. The head of state operates much like a dictatorship, by decree, and without oversight, restraint, or rule of law (given court orders are now being ignored). The de facto leader, Trump, is a deeply untrustworthy and mentally unfit individual, that no one will do serious "deals" with. The problem the USA has, is not a short term problem. If we assume Trump fails to secure a 3rd term,  after he's gone, there's absolutely no guarantee that another Trump-like ruler will take his place. The USA has become an unstable and untrustworthy place to do serious long term business in. We are witnessing the fall of a global superpower, there's no turning back now, the ship has sailed.
Im getting tired of all the winning
I doubt Boeing will be affected 😂 .🤷
What a shitshow America has become - and it did it to itself.
That's the right answer. No one wants to buy American equipment, and the boycott has gone global. Boeing is close to bankruptcy. Airbus exports 70% of the market.
Not to worry.  The UK doesn't have any Chinese tariffs - Airbus will replace Boeing in China.  Thank you Donald, we really appreciate the additional jobs.  Our economy is booming thanks to you.
That's the longest trip by a 737. If true, it would have flow over 7,000 miles! The max range for a 737 Max is around 4,000 miles.
Real war
Hitler Trump dictator  Is to blame
No country is going to buy Boeing products in a short while unless they are made outside the USA.  Why would any country buy any USA products or services? Why would anyone invest in USA stocks, US treasuries, the USA dollar.  The USA regime is volatile, unreliable and too hostile and toxic to deal wth.
What a pity: BOEING aircraft are top notch.
Thanks Trump you're the best........if you want to go bankrupt!
USA LOST THIS COMMERCIAL WAR. admit it.............Sorry, Nowadays it"s shameful to be a U.S. Citizen
Xiamen Airlines is a good airline by the way. Equivalent to Delta at some respects too.
Flight of shame
Check the planes for any bombs and surveillance planted.
Yes that’s what idiots voted for 😂😂😂😂
Americans may thank Trump for offering them a recession, confusion, and soon chaos on a silver plate
Well, the most infamous drag queen, *J.D Vance* did call the Chinese people *peasants* and Trump said they are stealing American jobs so this is the direct result of those hateful, words. Things will only get worse. #Winning #FafoSeason 😂
according to fox news report, China market is collapsing, they can't afford to the price of 2.5 times. returning the jet is a rational action.
Support would be to much to ask for. Lets piss and moan says MSM.
That's an expensive "F" around and found out! A dude with multiple failed business ventures given the reins of a nation! Way to go people..
What sound an airplane makes when it bounces back from China? BOEING!
China govt should subsidize xiaomi to build their own planes to sell....
Trump can buy them all Boeing jets
Imagine what a 125% tariff does to the price of a new Boeing 737 !
The end of Donald the Soup Nazi 😄 No more soup for you!
Has anyone else wondered why is it that these countries are stopping goods going to America because they’re losing money.  Well it’s because they can’t sell to other countries who don’t want to get ripped off.
Sorry you guys are protesting now?? You should have voted better!
They might be able to deliver planes on time now to other customers 😂
This is what Americans voted for time to enjoy😂😂😂😂😂
Bunch of Boeing employees voted for this 🤡
China can build their own Boeing!
Boeing had better start emptying parking lots because they're going to have a lot of new jets piling up there again.
Do not make the mistake of thinking that when trump's tariffs are cancelled,  things will return to normal for America,  that will never happen ,
America, are you great yet?
Boeing 737 MAX is in high demand, waiting list is long. Boeing just need to refurbish and sell/leash to other countries. But in longer term, Boeing sales will be ... :-((
AIRBUS IS GOOD TOO!!!
Imagine China imposes landing fees for Boeing jets in retaliation to the docking fee on Chinese ships🤯
Yeah… because the United States should be the ONLY country who should be paying tariffs… !
Fox should stop fact checking Reuters and start fact checking themselves. lol
Don't worry all these planes are coming to India after new paint. Indian Airlines have pending orders of more than 1000 aircrafts in pipeline right now. 500+ of them are with Boeing, rest with Airbus. Thanks to China, atleast we can have our planes delivered faster.
I live in the UK, I went to my usual supermarket on Saturday and found 1ltr bottles of Jack Daniels  discounted from £36 to £20 and nobody was buying them, normally the shelves would be empty at that price, don't know if it was down to people boycotting it, just seemed a bit odd,
You need to go and check to make sure Reuters isn't lying? You need to make sure Reuters isn't making up stories? lmao. When will it occur to the dear people of the MAGA tribe that there is no such thing as fake news being spread by the established media. It took decades of hard honest work to build up trust, why would they start publishing fairy tales all of a sudden. Fake news is just another term for hard truths these people don't want to see.
Lol like it  cant be sold to other countries
Seattle How Fitting. We remember the Battle in Seattle. How people came out and protested the off shoring of almost all US manufacturing jobs. My Dad (right wing Christian zealot) called the protestors a bunch of useless hippies. Yep, that was my Dad....the guy I had to learn from and figure out life on my own.
Lol, Airbus make better, safer aircraft anyway.
cant stop winning !
It is not very original but I have a few lyrics for you and I am not even from Canada. Sorry Don McLean   A long, long time ago I can still remember how that US used to make me smile   I can't remember if I cried  But something touched me deep inside  When once again Trump lied  We uses to buy buy American Rye Drove my Chevy to the Mackenzie but the river was dry  And them good ole boys were drinking US whiskey 'n rye  I can't remember if I cried  But something touched me deep inside  When once again Trump lied  So bye, bye, American Rye Drinking US rye... that will be the day that I die That will be the day that I die   Oh, and as I watched Trump on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell   And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw us laughing with delight The days that Trump was FIRED  Bye, bye, American Rye Drinking US rye... that will be the day that I die That will be the day that I die
Being the most powerful country doesn't mean  that you have to control and can control everything in the world!!!!!!
Ihr habt Trump gewählt, nun bekommt Ihr die Quittung. 😂
Xiamen airlines buys a lot of Boeing.  The first Dreamliner I ever saw was a Xiamen airliner.
This is why no one trusts the media because they leave half the story out, always playing politics! In 2024, Boeing said there were 4,763 unfulfilled 737 Max orders, airlines have to wait 4-5 years to get their order! Boeing is going to make more money because China is going to lose their deposits and all Boeing has to do is repaint the exterior and possibly reupholster the interior to fill some of the other 4763.
They can market to Africa we can buy them
Mashallah China 🇨🇳
You can buy US alcohol in Canada. I live in British Columbia.
I hope they send them all back. No one should ever buy “American” for the next 4 years.
Time to buy Airbus shares.
Good, more wine to consume locally
Oh Fox is concerned. You can pickle your Donald in vinegar, you pushed him and now everyone in US will pay the bill.
So if China wants to buy this same plane again, would that be a second hand plane?
to all idiots that voted for trump
War is coming.....
Who wants planes that loose doors and wheels? European Airbus is much better than Boeing. Fly your own crappie planes, drink your own headache wine, eat your own plastic cheese, drive your own ridiculous RAM tanks
Where are all the trump supporters in the comments….. they’re suddenly playing dead
Common everyone has some guts. This is way over due and tge market is done because it was way overpriced. Time to buy.
Free trade means that countries sell products to earn the money to purchase products from other countries. You cannot sell aircraft to another country if you refuse to buy goods from them. Still, for Boeing, there remain the lucrative government contracts (at the moment).
Don't know anyone is waiting in line to buy Boeing?  Next they will charge airport fee against Boeing.
Thank you China. Made in America Boeing is not safe.
FOX NEWS FALSE NEWS there's too much propaganda from Fox News
Don't fall for this propaganda! Something is happening in China! There are no buyers for their products and being offered in heaps of garbage.
Be careful what you wish for and ask for, sometimes it can be devastating 😢
I am amazed that fox trump follower are not clapping for this.
Serve you right, let's see when Boeing went bankrupt, good luck to all stupid Americans.
Music to my ears!
Not having a Max is a plus.
This Australian stands by Canada ❤❤  As for the planes, well I am sure Airbus is willing and ready.
oh now we’re citing sources in news stories again and using quotes (bc no one wants to be the one to say something negative lol)
USA against the rest of the world. And the USA will winning. It is only a dream.  Wake up! That won't happen.
Trump wants to destroy America and he will succeed if you leave him in the White House. How many casinos did this "business genius" bankrupt
Trump has a bone to pick with Boeing , did in term 1. He didn’t like them not going on bended knee for him.  We know how vengeful Trump is. He has always picked battles like this for people who wouldn’t do what he wanted just because he wanted it.
Trump proves to be the biggest mistake America has to endure for 4yrs... Trump's policies can't work in the modern world...they would work only if we were in the 1940s
Trump is so dumb! He is crashing us! Wake up America impeach this orange clown!!!!
This person is telling a lie totally  India already order a big number of planes form boeing  When china not received the air craft then they decided to immediate delivery to India that;s all there is no concept of red line  Awein fazool boingian mar rha
A lot of trump's tariff damage will not be reversed. Once countries stop buying from the US and form new trading alliances with other countries that market is lost.
Now the avalanche triggered by the new US administration is beginning to slide and will, above all, bury the global trust in the USA that has been built up over decades.
Hello this is USA: ON HOLD please 😢
*In the short term, this means that European, Indian and African airlines can get their new aircraft much sooner than expected.*  However, China being a rapidly growing market with an almost homegrown alternative aircraft company, this WILL hurt within the next ten years. But as 40% of the Chinese aircraft are foreign parts, it’s hard to tell when local companies have yet to copy (sorry INVENT) these parts for full independence of US suppliers.
USA can never blink first
Sana ilagay nlng sa pinas yang mga boeng mkatulong pa sa mga taong walang trbho wag na sa china gagayahin lng nika yan 😂😂😂
China builds their own planes now. No more need for Boeings.
They know the 737Max has shit air safety records!?
Back to the sender.😂
so no shares price go up???
I was trying my best to avoid flying Boeing, thank god their planes are getting fewer in the market.
Mad Tariff Guru Trump...how on earth u Americans give him second term?Now  everyone suffering.
US stupidity has made a shoddy aircraft with a poor safety record cost twice as much, any customer would back out of a deal like that.
Trump’s tariffs strategies are to drive the market to its lowest level and his family and the rich supporters will gain from the rebound when he announces that there’s no more tariffs. All the rich wants to buy low and sell high. Thank you Trump
Well done Trump. You’ve shot America in the foot. What a big mouthed idiot
Can't wait to see how they find a way to blame this on socialism.
You reap What you sow.
Make America Poor Again…. Good Job COWARDLY REPUBLICANS!
Well fuck around and find out MAGA. Now China will go to Airbus because well, they're the only other major aircraft manufacturer and China doesn't have capacity to build all the widebody aircraft it needs for now.
And that's how the after marker Boeing part industry started in China. They already have China as clients, where most of the time it is domestic flights, and Russia under sanctions, no doubt Africa will follow soon. and of course it is the American worker who will pay the price.
Play stupid games......
Is America great yet?
China has stopped all oil and LNG imports from the US.  Russia, Australia and Qatar have won the new contracts. Same story for food imports. For beans, Brazil has totaly replaced the US. China,
Letts gooo trump 😊
Maybe this is trumps fault?
The US-China trade deficit is a complex issue, and one of the most important reasons is that the US itself has set overly broad restrictions on the types of trade items. It is not advisable to only sell the lowest-end agricultural products and restrict the export of most electronic, technology, and industrial products that are out of date for China.
Boycott US..
Very Dodgy Airplanes
Isn’t this good news for the MAGA?
At the end of the story Trump will panic after seeing China & other countries moving to Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). 😉
Airbus wins. 😂
Karma Mr Trump.  TARIFFS  it's a beautiful word.  😅😅😅😅😅😅
The voters that put this administration in Oval Office should take responsibility
Temu return
Damn you Biden, this would never have happened under Trump. Oh, wait...
Boeing quality is so f***d up, they dig their own grave
The US believes they have intimidated China. However, I bet China was already aware that something like this was forthcoming and has been preparing for years.
And that plane also brought with it  a new version of the china virus.
It's not parked on the runway ffs. It's in a parking bay. How clueless are your reporters ? And btw Indian carriers will gladly pick up any plane the Chinese don't want since we have an order backlog of almost 500 plus jets.
AIRBUS will say thank you?
They don't take hostages like usa
Trump is King Midas in reverse all he touches trurns to Shite. JD Vance the Angel of Death.
Guys it’s been really difficult to get in an order for these Boeing aircraft now is a great time to get in your orders and not have to wait years before delivery!!
So China will be using their own made- in-China  plane from now on.
Grok Who Takes the Hit? Boeing: Financial Impact: Boeing likely bears the primary financial burden. The company only receives the bulk of payment for an aircraft upon delivery. Since the plane was not delivered to Xiamen Airlines, Boeing misses out on the revenue from this sale, which could be around $55 million (pre-tariff value). Additionally, Boeing incurs costs for the return flight (fuel, crew, logistics) and storage at Boeing Field. Reputational and Market Risk: The return signals disruption in Boeing’s deliveries to China, a key market that accounted for 20% of its commercial aircraft deliveries pre-pandemic. With China reportedly ordering its airlines to halt Boeing deliveries, Boeing faces the challenge of finding new buyers for this and potentially other returned aircraft, which may require repainting and reconfiguration, adding to costs. The company is already recovering from a five-year import freeze on 737 Max jets in China due to safety concerns, making this setback particularly damaging. Mitigation Efforts: Boeing may try to sell the aircraft to another airline, such as Malaysia Airlines, which has expressed interest in acquiring jets rejected by Chinese carriers. However, this process takes time and may involve discounts, further reducing revenue. Xiamen Airlines: Contractual Obligations: It’s unclear who made the decision to return the aircraft, as neither Boeing nor Xiamen Airlines has provided a clear explanation. If Xiamen Airlines refused delivery due to the tariff burden, they might still face contractual penalties or be required to cover some costs, depending on the terms of their agreement with Boeing. For example, Xiamen has six 737 Max jets on order, and backing out could involve financial consequences if the contract remains in place. Operational Impact: Xiamen Airlines avoids the immediate cost of a 125% tariff, which could have added $68.75 million to the plane’s $55 million price tag. However, not taking delivery delays their fleet expansion, potentially affecting their operational capacity and growth plans. This could lead to lost revenue if they cannot meet demand for flights. Symbolic Gesture: Some speculate the return is symbolic, given Xiamen’s small order of six 737 Max jets compared to their 142 aircraft in use. This suggests Xiamen might absorb minimal operational impact but could still face contractual costs. Broader Stakeholders: Chinese Airlines and Leasing Companies: China’s broader directive to halt Boeing deliveries affects other airlines and leasing firms. For instance, a Chinese leasing company reported a carrier pulling out of a 737 Max commitment, forcing the lessor to seek new buyers. These entities may face financial losses or delays in fleet planning. Washington State Economy: U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell highlighted the impact of tariffs on Washington’s trade-dependent economy, particularly its aerospace sector. Boeing’s disrupted deliveries could lead to reduced production or layoffs, affecting local workers and suppliers. Global Aviation Market: The tariff war disrupts the duty-free status aviation enjoyed for decades, potentially leaving more aircraft deliveries in limbo. This could increase costs for airlines worldwide and benefit competitors like Airbus, which is expanding in China. Critical Perspective The establishment narrative, as reported by Reuters, The Guardian, and FOX 13, frames this as a direct consequence of Trump’s tariffs and China’s retaliation. However, the lack of clear statements from Boeing or Xiamen Airlines raises questions about the decision-making process. Was the return a unilateral move by Xiamen to avoid tariffs, or did Boeing recall the plane to avoid a default on delivery terms? The absence of transparency suggests possible negotiations or disputes behind closed doors. Additionally, China’s claim of no formal directive to halt deliveries (per Lin Jian’s April 16 statement) contrasts with reports of such orders, indicating potential political posturing. Conclusion Boeing likely takes the biggest hit due to lost revenue, return costs, and market uncertainty in China. Xiamen Airlines may face contractual penalties but avoids the massive tariff cost, though their fleet growth is delayed. The broader impact ripples through Washington’s economy and the global aviation industry. Without clearer details on the contract or decision to return the plane, Boeing appears to bear the heaviest immediate burden.
It is just so naive for trump voters to believe that he genuinely cares about them.
Is the plane safe, knowing that Boeing prioritize profit over safety?
Vote a moron, get a moron.  Who could have guessed?
US just shot itself in the foot with a stupid dictator wannabe.
It’s going to fall.  From the sky.  Like many others
😂
Can you believe it? Fox is putting down on Republican Rinos.
Wackjob Trump is destroying the USA economy. It is in a downward spiral.
China pulled a FAFO 😂😂
American Army is weak people are ao arogant and weak they can't even win against veitnam afganistan 😂 how can they beat china lol which 100 times stronger than Afganistan veitnam. Ocean will not save you 😂😂😂  Love china from Strongest Muslim coutry Paksitan ❤
China is going down.
Is great the Boeing has returns to US and produce great job prospects in US.
We should change the name of America to North Koreamerica
Now USA has more plans and more wine as the rest of the world 😂 Nobody should buy any goods from USA. Trump can keep everything at home. ❤
Yanks wake up,  DJT and JDV disrespect the whole world, what do you expect to happen? More of this  to come I expect.  Looking from across the pond I feel so sorry for what you have done to yourselves
you mean returning the plane occasionally crash? maybe tariff is not the only reason
Ya......the US should ban the sales of Boeing 737 to China for national security reason. LOL....MAGA my foot !!!
America will never stop china. China is new no 1.love china from pakistan   bangladesh
United, Delta and American all have outstanding orders for aircraft. Maybe Boeing will finally be able to deliver some of these aircraft to the domestic customers.
This is the part where consumers start to freak out. OMG they sent it back lmao
🇺🇲 planes are inferior
MEGA 's First Day Loading... Sorry for Keep you waiting ...
You Poor uneducated Americans sure picked the biggest M oron for President..Enjoy the destruction he is going to cause the 🇺🇸...From this day forward the 🇺🇸 will never be great again
Americans will really feel all of this in a few months. It's going to hit harder than the Great Depression. Trump hates America and all the people in it. This is his retribution on us.
I am sure that sad excuse for human being unhinged, most stupid, most dumbest convicted lunatic felon banksrupt Trump has the money to buy it.
I guess this is what happens when you think you’re king of the world and reality disagrees, when you act like a tyrant threatening the UN for Israel then threaten your allies then threaten to annex sovereign countries you seriously can’t be surprised people don’t want to do business with you. The real problem now is this delusional idea that you can force china to bend the knee by threatening all there customers, it’s twilight zone politics.
we will earn billion of billion of dollar....chilll american u got trump so 0 to worries trump will make u and your country great again...how sad we  dont have trump in our country 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahahahahahahahahahah
The amount of goods that are exported are small compared to imported goods into the USA. There will be some hardships along the way. But in the long run the tariffs will be a good thing.  Remember! China 🇨🇳, Canada 🇨🇦 and other countries can lower their tariffs and resume trade.
Shame on U. S.  Escalating tensions all over Europe
No worries. Somebody else will buy it and China can get back in line.
Shame on Donald Trump and World biggest terrorist supporter U. S.   U. S.  is responsible for destabilizing World peace and stability
😂😅
trump begging ☎☎☎☎ instead xi kick trump assh..
I think that Americans need to understand that the world has had enough of their politicians, who have deceived the people with their wars, political interference and regime change. In China they have met their match which with support of Russia, Brics and the global south will knock reality into the supposedly American economic and military might. Maybe then justice for those poor souls in the likes of Latin America, Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti, Libya and of course Palestine will be served.
trump should pay compensations from his own pocket
Usha Vance is a known street shit*er
Sucks to be Boeing.  How long before Comac takes their ENTIRE Share of the market?  There's a lot of planned aviation route expansion in the BRICS Countries, Countries that  have far better relations with China than the US.
Take care american while visiting out of US.. peopke gossiping and hate you. Whole world. They dont care!
Anymore  cards dump trump？
Good news for airbus...Thanx Trump
Unfortunatelt the elites like dumb trump won't listen to. He only listens to his canibet kiss assing him.with good words 😂😂😂
Look who Trump economic advisors are and you will understand
Canadian here. This crazy trade war is a blessing in disguise. We're far too dependant on the U.S. markets and it's about time we started selling to the rest of the planet. We have oil, natural gas, critical minerals, uranium, potash, wood products.......our true friends are in Europe and Asia. Good luck, Donnie, with making America great again!
#TrumpForPrison2025 #JdVanceForPrison2025  #DeportElonMuskImmediatelyBackToSouthAfrica 💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙
American voters also can't point to Trump and say he is the problem and we are not part of this. You also wanted other countries to bow to you. And remember there are more than 40% American people still think Trump doing the right thing.
Trump is behaving too stupid, and here is next result. Not Only China but any strong nation would do this
This is karma, well you got what you voted for, so now swallow the bitter pill you expected the rest of the world to swallow.
I thing trump saying we gonna be tire of winning
You ideot amrican can't imagine they allready pay premium form chinese product. Trump Just delay chinese growth. And in long term it's good for us power shift to china. Trump Just save you ass . From china.
N230BE - the Xiamen Air B38M aircraft - is on the TEST registration. It was not yet delivered.
Boeing planes are safest in the storage yard.
Boeing's first employee is a Chinese aeronautical engineer. Chinese will be able to build all these passengers carrier with their own homegrown engineers
Donnie,did Xi called u about this? Or is it still silent
Who did they buy from... Costco 🤷🏽‍♂️ I wonder if they needed a receipt to return that too 😂
Donald J Trump is a deal breaker not a dealmaker and working from a doctrine of thievery and cultural systematic fraud, lies and extortion.  Trump and his stooge minions are shutting down American exports.
The EU won’t buy any Boeing because they have airbus which not only supplies all of Europe but the world too taking a huge chunk of Boeings customers because Boeing has been declining fast
Considerable payment is made before anything goes to shipping for export case and point Boeing is paid in full when a Airplane is painted.  IT is the arrogance of those companies who export to China when they know full well China will not pay the export tax and did NOT collect the tax before shipping.
We've been poking China for years. This didn't start Jan 2025. And China has been preparing  They have the raw materials, the manufacturing capability and STEM knowledge to cripple us. Trump just accelerated the fall.
又赢了😊
Trump has destroyed the economy
I wwisb news were showing how American technology is been stolen by China, think if some stole from your house slowly by slowly
I don't think it's something to worry about.The backlog is huge any county can take those aircraft with minor changes.
China 🇨🇳  is on fire  🔥   , china is,tell us who is the BOSS
FAFO 🤣
So?
Why doesn't China support maga??
We Bangladeshis will sell our rare earth minerals to China when US turns to us for the minerals, thanks.
Lock us out on Chinese Market. Lol this guys are PRO China and anti america
A lot of other countries are soon going to have new routes and cheaper flights.
Nobody wants Boeing anyways. It’s not safe.
That's "the art of the deal" Chinese style, don't poke the dragon
Trump is grinding the US into the ground. He has no idea what he's doing but his billionaire buddies will be OK.
"if these tariffs persist" -- The damage is already done. Foreign countries are making permanent, long-term plans to switch to other trading partners. Even if the tariffs are lifted, only a fool would think that the US is a trustworthy partner.
boeing 737 is flying coffin. Only China want to buy it.. Even Boeing engineering do not want to use it.
Good, China should impose tax on any inbound Boeing planes from any countries into China.
Now you know why Chinese call Trump "Chuan Jianguo川建国", the name means Trump builds China. It is not MAGA, but MCGA. Wake up MAGAer,  Trump is a Chinese spy!
And you can all thank to Donald Trump 😊😅😂
Please stop calling USA America! USA is just only a part of North America
Hahahahahaahha
And still, the cult loves their orange god
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, you idiots voted for him, now suffer the consequences
Maybe Boeing can fill thier domestic orders now. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I don't like government dictating who buys or don't buys what though.
Tarrifs are on IMPORTS not EXPORTS. Sheeple here have literally never heard the word tarrif in their life until they got their talking points from the MSM. US Airlines can't get new jets fast enough, a US carrier will take this jet immediately. China can't make it's own airplanes without our engines, subsystems and avionics, COMAC is only Chinese in name only and is 15-20 years away R&D wise to get there. Airbus doesn't have the excess capacity, so the only loser here is CHINA. American, Delta, United and Southwest can't new get 737s fast enough.
Fox telling some "truth" for a change? Wonders will never cease. Rupert must be spitting tacks. Evil crook that he is.
This is what America First looks like in the real world.
Fake News 😂!
Airbus meanwhile: do nothing, and win.
*here to watch entertainment only*
Fantastic wording again here even from the title
how to say Donnie you dont have the card without saying Donnie you dont have the card
Thanks to Donald Orangutan 😂I'm glad I'm not American and have to put up with these🤡🤡🤡
Trump says tariffs are good for the USA. Surely this cannot be true?
2:45 Send that wine to Boston!!  The Illegals there will drink anything 😊
bye forever Booooooooooooooooooooeing!
All started by trump
you wanted a decouple, you got decouple why so sad?
By electing Trump Americans have obliged world’s population
give the man's plan a chance.
Trump is still awaiting a call from Beijing. 😂😂😂
have you felt the impact yet Americans?
tbere is absolutely no market for 40000 737s😅
It doesn't matter whether it's because of Trump's tariffs, as long it's a Boeing, most countries around the globe ain't buying.
FAFO 🔥🔥😂😂😂
Peasants😂😂😂 that backfired into a well taught lesson... now everyone will see US is not that big of a super power ...
maybe its because 737 max has been crashing...
Action/Reaction😮
Jdv can sell that to india while at it.🤣🤣🤣😝😝
Italian proverb: You wanted the bike? Now pedal.
Who wants to risk their lives on taking Boeing?
I'm so happy for US corporations... Thank you to all countries giving Trump the finger!
Y’all voted for him. Drive 30 minutes out of Seattle and the trump flag flies freely everywhere.
FAFO! Now the US in the beginning of the Finding Out stage! Enjoy your high prices and collapsing economy 'Muricans! Heheheheehe
Move to isolate. Consolidate power. Pre-WW2 era.
Oh NO, the world don't wanna trade with us bullys ... Who could have seen this coming 🙄
Now, who would buy their Airplane with self crashing technology?....
Fair enough. USA stops goods from China. China stops goods from USA. Trump will make America great again, by keep all goods in USA. All fellow Americans, enjoy the planes, the beans, and the corns.
President Donald Trump is illiterate in economics why he never read a books.His tariffs will cause a global disaster to our economy.
This report doesn't mention all the facts. This report only tells one sided information. Trump administration is: "balance" what China does to USA.
DUMB would say "FAKE NEWS"
Now the people of usa getting the taste of tariffs a blunder of the century made by the person who was  saying let’s make America great again so here is first result
Dumb move by an equally bigotry presidents who think he know how to intimidate other countries! Good job China n the rest of the countries who have opposed trump n his bullying attics!
China hit back hard😅
Bro this comment section is 🔥 😂😂
None of this or those items affects me or most people I know. Tariffs are an interesting strategy I'm fine with exploring. If it is a problem in 3 years, vote differently.
Trump supporter buy those aircraft.
Photo op stunt, I don't care for the Cheeto in the white house either but it was just way to piss in his direction.
TRUMP decision are right to counter CHINA for that loss to AMERICA also bear maximum loss but in end AMERICA will WIN .
In the end of the video, she wasnt sure if it was the right plane yet... what BS!
that's what you get... still waiting for someone to explain and break down the upside of all this madness that's been happening for the past 2/ 3 months 😐
You are clueless and undermining what our president can accomplish. Stop second guessing a man who has been negotiating his whole life. You arent equipped for it.
If their was a problem in the tariffs, why send the plane to China in the first place?
THIS is not a one-off. China is not waiting for USA to ban sales of Boeing to China. China is self banning itself from buying Boeing from USA.
Donald Trump and his gangster have to step down from White House right now .the whole America people will have better life .America will have stronger economic again hand and hand with China .Canada and many more countries . Trump destroyed America.
Going Great yet America 🇺🇸
Serve you right....please ask your president to buy it
If you hired a clown 🤡 as your lider, everyone else will laugh at him, and you
Trump has sunk America
China isn't stupid.  They are going out and buying what they need from other countries like Brazil and Canada where there is no tariff war.  That means lower GDP, more inflation and more unemployment for us.
All the airline companies should start buying Airbus
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Donald Trump,  the Manchurian president of PRC, In the White House.  😊😂😂😂
Boeing, Apple, Microsoft … US big firms or Brands have huge business surplus in China ..  stupid Trump only count US import goods surplus .. China can easily ban US firm business to retaliate tariff ..
Imho... America's economy is the largest in the world. America's technology is the best in the world. America's democracy is an inspiration to the world. Yet, you have a president who only has enough IQ to tie shoelaces?  Do you want to make America Grreat Again? Sure, but please don't do it at the expense of other countries.
USA economy is FU(KED  all new Boeing aircraft will be banned from going to China!! They have canned the contract!!
LOL!!!! This is what you all voted for or failed to vote against! Reap it, United States of Hate! Reap it! LOL!!!!!!!!
Interested to see FOX reporting on this as much of what is happening isn't being fully reported on.  The US is in SERIOUS trouble and I hope folks will start looking at world news and wake up.
2:32  Canada literally evaporated?  RIP!
The winning just continues and continues.  How could anyone get tired of all this winning?
I wonder if we’re screwing things up.
Cantwell has no concern over the $37 T debt.
Sell it to Taiwan for 50% off....lol.   That should piss off China.
Trump that mad genius has united the world
debra from raymond?
cmon BRICS. liberate me
Airbus is the future. 👍
China will be grounded with the planes they already bought without parts from Boeing. Raise the tariffs even higher. Canada will down to two seater prop jobs even sooner if they don't lower tariffs.
Rest assured they will go to Airbus Who will benefit? EU 😅
Order cancelled,😂
👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Boeing jet 737 Max was rejected by China, well guess for safety reason. As the world knows that 737 Max is the scariest jet in the world in term of its safety.
China still ripping us off.
the chinese are HUGE on relationship building, loyalty, and trust. they are saying bye bye to you guys.
AIRBUS stocks up
trumps America...liberation day my a$$ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Trump genius?  Much like the wily coyote was.  Nothing he has done has worked.   At least he’s consistent.
Democrat Billionaires bitching about having to tighten their  belts.  But they fail to tell you how China is doing...
Damm, the TDS is rampant in this one!
This is China American people...
oops! That will hurt
Instead of uniting America,  you are fighting with each other We Indians became slaves of England because of this split
Immediately redevelop and rebrand it for carriers in India, there's a huge waiting for ordered aircrafts.
This item can be returned in its original condition within 30 days of receipt for change of mind.
Only the beginning because China is not going to be only country that won't be buying Boeing made planes.
this is MAGA dream news
Are you tired of winning?
Stupif TRUMP FUCKING MY COUNTRY UP
You people can blame the democrats for this.  Bill Clinton started giving the US markets away years ago. The token Obama just made it worse.
Let's hope there's no restocking charge. You can thank your 1st lady DonJohnUn for the "return to sender".
This is actually what Americans have voted for😅
Airbus is smiling😊
Where are all the idiots on the comment section that voted for the orange back in November? Speak up, why so quiet now?
So much whinning, i mean winning 😂
There's more reason to ban Boeing than just the tariffs.
China necesita una leccion de humildad. la dictadura china al final caera.
If it's Boeing the Chinese ain't going.
Surprised a Boeing jet could make it that far
Trump is a lunatic destroying the economy and hurting average Americans.
This is really very bad!!!!
Give  alcohol. To Donald Trump.  Let him drink.
This will have far reaching consequences. A consumer lost will probably find alternatives. Once found, it is a consumer lost for ever...
AMERICANS ARE WEAK, LAZY, and cant stand for their entitled-asses to be uncomfortable for ONE seconds. And yall really think yall can win a trade war with CHINA😅😅😅😅😅.   Asian people pack 3 GENERATIONS into tiny homes  just to ensure their kids go to the best school and get the best education. CHINA already won, their are mentally waaay stronger to endure the war.    In 72 hours Trump had to pause the tariffs because of all the complaints he was getting. In the words of Kobe Bryant, Americans, yall are "SOFT"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Trump wants to bring back US steel and aluminum production, but the problem is its gonna hurt, manufacturing, auto motive, construction, and the airline industries. Higher input costs will make these industries less competitive... 🤷🤷Canadian steel was both cheap and high quality. Why put tariffs on us? This is no longer capitalism and free trade.
Иииииии
The next time a democrat gets elected to fix this mess again the public will just blame when when it’s not done fast enough 😂. This is why the US citizens gets played so much. There literally no incentive to try because people have short term memory 😂
lol! Our idiot in chief strikes again!, Thanks Chump!
China knows where to put the hurt.
Airbus thanks you! 🍾🥂
A normal delivery period of 2+ years upon order is needed for Boeing Aircrafts. Such huge cancellation of orders is not going to effect Boeing. At present there is only one competitor, that is Airbus. If excess orders goes to Airbus, theirs too delivery period will get doubled so Airline companies around the globe will be forced to balance the order for intended deliveries.
That's fine lets get our planes back and give them back their crap that will broke yesterday. I am going to start buying nicer things from now on. I am sure this will help me long term.
Never trust anyone from Boeing
Trump 2028 🇺🇸🇺🇸♥️♥️
WHY  CHINA  REJECTED  THE  DELIVERY..??  IS  TRUMP  KNOW  ABOUT  THIS ....😮😮
Isn’t it good news for local, it means oversupply, cheaper plane for local airlines, therefore cheaper airfare.
Why China wants a Boeing? Can they make its own airplane or they wanna to copy it?
Thats China’s  loss. Those are ordered long before they are built. Another airline will jump at the chance to buy that aircraft.
😂😂😂😂😂 Maga my 4ss
LIES as usual Got no canadian federal government rule to ban American alchool.
Good idea. Boeing planes suck
more lay off, more unemployment, more wstern peasants 🤣
Americans are hard to understand. They throw a watermelon off a bridge, and when it is smashed on the road below, they behave in shock and awe, as if they genuinely did not anticipate such an outcome.  Funny or not..  it is making the rest of us take pause.
A huge opportunity.....Why don't you try us up here in Canada? we have a huge military contract for jets scheduled.And we  know nowadays  a contract with the United States isn't worth the paper its written on....
The weird part about it maga is very happy with Trump. Are they in love with Trump or they turned into zombies 🧟‍♀️ 🤔
No one around the world wants your planes - Australia included !
Trump is destroying USA!
Now they will donate all the return aircraft to Israel 😂😂😂😂
China banning new Boeing aircraft and parts, will soon ground the entire fleet of Boeing 737 jets in China. That will be interesting to watch.
FAFO!!
Planes are already being resold 😂 Chinee CCpee 😢
Take a cup of coffee,drink it.
Trump knows the problems that drugs, illegal immigration, and debt waste your tax dollars. He needs to make changes to create a difference. Let's bring jobs back for your children. Without change, there is no improvement. Instead of saying "make someone great," maybe we should think about how to make ourselves great.  You think you can friendly say to China and other countries that their tariffs are higher (China's is 22%), while China's goods entering the USA face close to 0% tariffs. They will say we need to negotiate, but how long will that take—20 years or 30 years? Previously, no one wanted to change because they lulled you into complacency. Now is the opportunity to change.  If you give up, the game is over.
Airbus is getting orders without lifting a finger
Boeing was already only kept afloat by subsidies through military contracts.
Sir..are we winning yet..😂😂😂
Poor bird has been deserted 😅
Why do you want to sell to Chinese peasants 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It won't matter if they have a backlog of plane orders. They just chage paint scheme and deliver it to another company or country.
It's so wonderful. This is the best news ever. Thank you President Trump 👍
We don't need china crap
Don’t sell planes to china. We don’t need them.
the blue plane there does not seem to be 737 Max. but the white one behind the reporter is. Max has the split wing tip.
Zero impact to Boeing or United States. 737 Max aircraft are on a waiting order. Many airlines like Delta have placed orders and have been waiting for many years. In fact, China, sending this plane back is hilarious considering it will just go to the next person in queue.
The next time a democrat gets elected to fix this mess again the public will just blame when when it’s not done fast enough 😂. This is why the US citizens gets played so much. There literally no incentive to try because people have short term memory 😂
It would have been so great if they removed the Airline name in China and stuck on F-U Trump Air 😎😎😎😎 then sent it back 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Decoupling is coming Real now...
Who knew?  Boeing is just like Costco.
MAGA Murica fuk yeah!!
Any comments on the other airlines that have offered interest in grabbing the returned planes.
I think you guys all smart people can think of this risk when Trump play the card and moreover Vance called Chinese as Peasant. So now you can sell those to aliens in Mars.
Stupid Trumphumpers... ¿You know those people who buy an exotic leopard or chimpanzee and then it ests or rips offf their face?
This is too funny!The states is turning on truly on the road of becoming it's own prison
China is racist for not buying our airplanes! Reciprocity
trump promised you new factories, where are they?
China is getting tired of winning.
She tryed to warn ya all. but ya all got Coned by the biggest con man ever. make america great again.. ya he does a great job..
I did  say  things  can only  get  better  still  waiting
The agreed price was 55 m $. Through tariffs, it went up to 165 m $. Wouldn't you do the same?
Trump est un Idiot 🤣
dont worry  your dear fearless leader will buy it and re-start Trump Skuttle International   in the first example of  bring it home for bizniss  (all 200 unsaleable planes I guess )   problem solved    vote stupid do stupid get stupid
Boeing scares me ... I prefer Airbus
So?  Is this an onion article
😂😂😂😂
Boeing workers shouldn't be worried. They will be hired by Shein and Temu to manufacture clothes... 😂😂😂
737 Max? Oh God ....
That’s what we voted for 😂…are you sure 😢
American distributors worked so hard for 25 years to establish relationships with China. Now in 3 months- the market is destroyed. I know people who’ve lost fortunes. People on the outside have no idea.
Thanks a lot trump in less than 3 months you destroyed our economy, unfortunately the worst is yet to come.
Returning garbage
I am a Canadian. The decision to pull American booze from Canadian retail shelves was made by the PROVINCES  not our FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The WORST is still to come America. The World will not allow DUMPSTER donnie to play the tariff game. See you guys on the unemployment line.
Tariff just makes everything more expensive!  245% tariff? Just imagine $10 a dozen of eggs will be $34.50
I pity Americans on the stupidity of Trump in global trade.
Make Airbus Great Again😂
He is wrong about US alcohol in Canada. It was strictly voluntary. The Federal Gov't had nothing to do with it.
Impeach trump
So these countries like China have been levying heavy tariffs against the United States for years but now that the U.S. is actually standing up saying until you stop ripping us off, we are going to tariff you as much as you have been doing to us for decades, you people are upset about that???? Go live in communist China if you don’t like it. Go USA Go 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
It shouldn't be too difficult for foreign companies to fill the void, eventually bypassing American manufacturing entirely. Boeing in particular has been struggling with strange engineering decisions and serious safety concerns. If isolation is not what you want, you better make your feelings clear to your glorious leader.
They will just sell it to someone else. They have a big back log. They should have kept it. They ordered it before the tariffs
Flying coffin
This looks like a staged event.  Fake news
the FINDING OUT phase. enjoy!
Who cares about China?
Now it will resell as an open box
Hey Boeing, stop buying Chinese parts and supplies stop Boeing’s assembly plant line in China. Don’t sell any Boeing parts to China’s airlines.
The return of this Boeing jet from China doesn’t make any sense at all.  This blunder is on Boeing as someone has dropped the ball on the job. Didn’t Chinese government tell Boeing not to send anything to China or it will be rejected before the war trade between two countries has begun more than a week ago?
All this winning is mind numbing. Congratulations to all of us. 🤡💩
Now we are missing sleepy Joe!
Piss Poor fake news, this is all speculation. You are identifying that plane without confirming it
Tell me, is it Biden’s fault or Obama’s? I’m not really sure anymore.
Win for Airbus 😅
As someone who despises Trump, I love the way china is retaliating. But then again, who really gets the short end of the stick here??
Plus the cost to repaint over the Chinese airline name and logo😅😮
Well.. they figured made in china planes could be better quality then boeing.
Trump is a uneducated DORK .. ???
Singapore should stop ordering planes from Boeing. US has a trade surplus with S'pore and yet the S'pore is slapped with a 10% tariff for no reason at all. S'pore should at least retaliated to bring the message across to its so-called 'good friend' that we cannot be bulled just because we are small. Also, stop depending on US military equipment and diversify asap.
😂 only a stupid person or a mad one will voluntarily hurt himself.
Boeing mades terrible planes now!  They need to hire some AirBus engineers and assembly workers and fire their present workers!
Wait a minute!  I thought that China already had high tariffs on American imports.
So much winnings
To,INDIA at once
Nobody wants Boeing anymore 😭
Low and behold.
Let china used their own COMAC 999 planes let their own NATIONS peoples used their own made COMAC planes HAHHAHAH  AIRBUSS & BOIENG  MUST STOP SUPPLY ALL THE AIRCRAFT PARTS NEW PLANES AS WELL ,,,,WE CAN SEE HOW CHINA WILL BE DESPERATE
😂😂😂😂
Its up to you, people against Trump.
Who is buying this crap 😂 kudos China
Wow, Fox didn't spin this into a win for Trump?  I was fully expecting this would be explained by China experts as another downfall of China and win for USA.
That’s right. 2:37 Canada is DONE w/criminal felon, disrespecting & threatening. Goodbye USA. Canada will remember this shameful treatment.
America doesn't know what's happening.  You guys better pray hard that God changes the entire situation because a lot of people can't cope with what's going on. I ain't judging nobody, but you have got to admit that if it's true, what the media is reporting better humble yourselves before God.
The Baerskin Hoodie (advertised here) is a scam.  I ordered the product, and after more than a month, they still had not shipped it.  My credit card, fortunately, refunded the money.
Boeing is a disaster. Faulty planes, COVID, faulty planes again and now Tarrifs
This all Biden's fault. How things so hard to fix, even with Trump's business skill
Boing also realizes that buying an airbus is more expensive so business in usa will boom.
Self created tragedy. What a stupid president.
Great job mr empty head trump you are a total useless wanker
FAFO😂😂😂😂
Trump’s philosophy: business is about loose-loose, yippie 😂
Did return because it broke?
Fox, you helped elect that monster Trump.
All EU is going to AIRBUS 😂😂😂😂😂
*How many of you trump voters are still waiting for America to be great again? It’s go be a long wait*
I wonder why americans are suddenly destroying the world peace. Surely usa is ending this state system. Are we back to monarchies and empires?
Maga voters are dumb as hell.
Fox Sux
Good who in hell would want to go there anyway.
It's no longer MAGA, it's murder and madder
DON'T BLAME THEM
Airbus stock gon to the mooooonn
Ahhh, the price of stupidity. Do you get it yet, MAGAts? Or do you need to experience even more pain to wrap your primitive minds around what is happening TO YOU?!
FOX - your propaganda machine is responsible for all this. Do not think you will ever be off the hook
LNG 1.5 billion order : UK Stopped USA and given to Australia,  Boeing : billion dollar contract cancelled and given to Airbus and cost of Airbus is even low.. Also china and Russia flights are available for sale soon with even low price with more tech.. Canada : stopped visiting USA cities or beaches, also wine  Trump : we need nuclear deal with iran because Israel is sleepless USA people : due to your mad tarriff we're sleepless first give priority to USA citizen, not Israel.. Already you guys spend trillions for killing children's of Gaza 😢
Good, now stop selling spare  parts to china.
Why is everyone making a big deal about President Trumps tariffs when he is only doing what other countries do to America.
1. Boeing helped China build a factory making Boeing planes 2. China started making their domestic (copied) planes and stopped ordering from Boeing. 3. Boeing sales has nothing to do with tariffs.
Boeing donated USD 1 million to Trump inaguration, so they're just reaping what they paid for
Nobody wins .... I'm sad for hard working individuals creating this marvel of human  engineering...
billions in tax income right?  yeah riiiiight
In the short run, Air India, Indigo and Akasa Air will pick up all available Boeing planes, scheduled  for delivery for  the next 4-5 years to China. A trade/tariff war is generally not a good thing, hopefully things will with out in the long run.
You have no idea  the bad luck someone born in the year of the dog will bring: He was born in the Chinese astrological  year of the dog 1946; born to fail ( and everything he has ever touched has gone bankrupted, thanks to his dady's fortune. He is not a self made man) Herbert Hoover also born in the year of the dog 1874 brought the great depression of 1929...(1929 year of the serpent and this year is 2025 the year of the serpent, too). It is Anubis the jackal a dog who brings death, the werewolf and the moon. No wonder they are archetypes of the collective unconscious, which perfectly synchronize in every culture. The "Dog" stops you from going forward, wastes your time, impedes, causes you to stumble, insist on smelling everyone's butt, barks and bites your neighbors; Now ain't this Trump? For God's sake look at the truth...David Ben-Gurion born in the year of the dog 1886 and it has been cruelty and suffering eve since, cause dogs bring SUFFERING! Igor Girkin born in the year of the dog 1970 started the Ukraine war in 2014 (Google it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Girkin) Dogs bring suffering, cruelty and death and the Chinese know all this from 2,000 years of observation.. Dogs are weak and their cry is: "I Fear" ..Look at Ted Bundy and his immense cruelty...And what do all these 3 people have in common besides Trump Jean Caroll, Stormy Daniels and Thomas Crook ? They were all and all of them born in the year of the sheep 1943-1979-2003...You can not make this stuff up... 50 years of hard statistics prove it...
Thank God these tariffs are doing such good things for the United States. 🎪🤡🎪
Is there a restocking fee?
Boing is just going to sell the planes to another client
*Donny let's tariffs on the Island full of Penguins and Seals* 😂
No one in their right mind, wants to deal with Donald anymore! He's an idjit!!
France Airbus is happy and celebrating 🎉
We are winning so much in the tariffs' war.
It's a big damn world, there are plenty of other countries to buy those jets. More fearmongering
Donald Drum egos and pretending, Must resign as president of America immediately.
Airbus, EMBRAER, Comac celebrating every Trumpo decision
It's terrible to watch what trump is doing to US goods and services. Someone needs to fire trump. he's a terrible president!
Almost everything comes from China😢
Karma 😮 From Canada 🇨🇦
Well a quick refit and I expect an American airline will get an aircraft quicker than they were expecting. I wonder if they still have the passengers for it.
that's not parked on the runway
Check for covid or WORSE!!!    CANT EVER TRUST CHINA
Everyone is freaking out before the plan to reduce Chinese tariffs bears fruit. This had to be done there was too large of a trade imbalance,China will come around or go broke, they had the same plan for the US but it has now backfired and they are loosing they're asses.
This misinformation keeps getting repeated. The "Canadian government" did not mandate removal of US alcohol. That's done on a provinical level. Most if not all provinces elected to remove US alcohol, including BC. But it was done at the provincial level, not the federal level.
you will win so much that you might even get tired of winning, then you say Mr.President, I cannot take it anymore, it is too much of winning
This situation of rumbbling issues & wwlll immenent, all must be checked at all ports possible chemical and biological warfear and warfare
Anyone who voted for that lying idiot Trump, this is your fault. The guy lied like a rug, and you idiots believed and/or excused his lies. Wasn't it irresponsible of him to say the lie "I'll end the war in 24 hours"? How could anyone believe this is possible? He lied saying that he would reduce inflation when all along he was planning these price-increasing tariffs. Republican and Democratic economists agree that tariffs always increase prices. He lied about not having any boxes of classified documents, then when the FBI seized the boxes, revealing his lie, he lied again and said he was targeted by a weaponized DOJ, and he distracted by the childish "what about Biden?" fallacy.  (Biden said "oopsie, a couple of the thousands of documents I have are classified, come and get them", while Trump lied for years about having them in the first place and the FBI had to come seize them in a raid.)  Trump is a disaster. It took him two months to wreck the global economy, his idiot secdef has the pentagon in chaos, people are being rounded up without a trial, and Trump is ignoring a unanimous SCOTUS ruling to return a resident alien that was here legally.  Trainwreck Trump, please resign.
Why would they buy Boeing?? Did they already copy the plane?? lol
Karma 😢this is what happened when u screw others Canada 🇨🇦
You know Boeing works with more than 65 countries for manufacturing, service, and technology partnerships. Including suppliers who manufacture parts for commercial airplanes, defense products & space systems. X Boeing relies on a global network of suppliers for parts, including companies in the US, China, Japan, and Australia, with key manufacturing locations in Everett and Renton, Washington, and SC
😂 America great again Donald and Elon musk
cherry-picked stories about very specific items...  yeah, it's no wonder the news media is all over this.  Chinese reports small exporters/businesses going bankrupt because they can't get a (bail-out style) loan.  Major US corporations might dominate the market for a while, but still, many people turn a blind eye to the fact that Bill Clinton started the trade agreements long-ago.
Trump doesn’t care folks, wake up.
Traitor Dump making China great again. 😂😂😂😂😂
Now Boeing have to find other country to buy that return jet, and good luck with that.
This is Trump war against the China ! Whether Trump is right or wrong , China got to fight back.
News flash Trunp just blame Biden for exports being sent back to America
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Sell to india,they will be happy to buy
I don't know about you but I'm tired of "WINNING"
Awesome trump ,you yanks can foot the bill
Real life example of how tariffs work. The airline will have to pay 125% tariff because it's American made. Boeing surely is not paying any part of that tariff. So return it goes.  Wonder who gave the impression the SELLER pays for the tariff? 🤔
Well done Trump
Fake news from Donald trump and his maga
Boeing is done. Not only is their quality shit, now the arrogant US is asking to pay extra tariffs. Lol
Trump will stand strong and level the playing field.
This plane will be sold as "Open Box - Like New"
Keep the pressure on China, they have been indulging in unfair business practices forever. It will be difficult at first.
The Chinese make their own planes now.  Comac 919 929.   And going from end of this year for 949 big jumbo jets 😂😂😂😂😂. Awake guys.   Also the AJ planes made by China.   For international routes they will use the acreditate Airbus.     For local market and some countries in Asia they already fly C919 which is way better than Boeing 737 max.    😂😂😂😂😂 awake guys.   China no need to buy from USA anymore.   Also Russia they don’t buy.    Russia make their own planes also.  😂😂😂😂 Iran. Pakistan and all Central Asia countries buy from Rusia.  😂😂😂
Sell it to Russia ! The Donnie approves !
Winning
Nobody is going to call Donald. They do not trust you.
IMHO, Congress needs to take Dumpty's tariff power away from him. Grow a spine GOP!!! 💯🤡
China is looking to buy Carpets the flying ones😂
So the U.S has kicked another own goal.
No one was there to sign for
united states of russia is a JOKE 😂😂😂😂 world watching it sink while LOL really hard
Good call!!
It’s more than just the tariffs, which are important but not the main thing. Trump has threatened to annex Canada so it’s not surprising that Canadians are boycotting US products. I expect that after our Federal election next week, one of the new government’s top priorities will be working to refocus our Canadian trade relations with Europe rather than the US. No one should be surprised by the Canadian reaction to Trump’s annexation threat. Imagine how you’d feel if you lived in Alaska and Putin ridiculed your leaders and threatened to annex you.
"Lo and behold" and "comes on the heels of"? This is 2025 not 1625.
China has already built their own large planes and will use them in the future.  They will also develop all the other banned products like advanced chips.
With every day passing, we're getting closer to Trump being dragged out of the White House   by his short and curlies.😂
This just adds to boeing downfall.  Emirates cancelled 70 boeing orders, klm cancelled all their future orders and quantas as well.  No more money for boeing.  Looks like taxpayers will be on the hook bailing boeing out.
Everything that our beloved leader touched has crumbled ….
The art of the deal!
You know them Boeing employees voted for  Trump
GO TRUMP! America First
Voting Donald McDonald the hamburger clown...What a waste of time...
Congratulations. Welcome to the disaster 😂😂😂😂😂
Corrupt media work for ccp than the USA.  IF BOEING DIDNT CONFIRM YET WTF THIS CORRUPT CHANNEL REPORTED THE FAKE NEWS
A Democrat? Complaining?
We were never making money that much exporting anyways. Stop being scare you guys. We make up the majority of the consumer market. We have the advantage.
Do we feel great yet?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This mess is all Trump's fault.!!;
Those are Chinese tariffs, not Trumps tariffs public school education for you
Deportation purposes? Splendid
But, But we are owning the libs aren’t we? 🫤
Washington, a Democrat State, doesn’t like what Trump is doing. They didn’t seem to mind when the Democrat POTUS allowed 12,000,000 illegals into the country destroying many Republican Cities and States.
because it was your old grandfather who started all this 😅
Oh Fox... so is China the one to blame? Please.
GREAT JOB TRUMP...ASS****
Oh well FAFO
If he bankrupted 4 casinos, what the hell do you think he'll do, succeed? Once a loser, always a loser...Stop surrounding Trump in an echo chamber...The situation ain't nothing bright; in 6 months you're gonna get 30% poverty and unemployment, if this shallow, superficial, aspartame and saccharine administration of people's lives continues. And this is based on hard Ratio analysis and variable projection of the economy...  Already 6 trillion lost and this knuckle head is talking about the debt, man oh man, this dude is gonna sink ya in quick sand...The Chinese ain't the problem now, Trump is and an extremely dangerous situation..
Haha how's that MAGA working for you now serves you right for voting in Donald .....
Congratulations to the people who for trump make America great again.
Another proud moment for Trump and MAGA.  Yep, that'll fix the Chinese. 🙂
This is what people voted for or didn't get off their ass and vote...they must be soooo happy!
😂😂😂...Boeing doesnt build planes then bill you, this plane was paid for or at least 50-75% paid for, so Boeing can now resale the plane to someone else, the CHINS Refused delivery, which is a contract breech, there not getting there money back😂😂😂... on the subject of all these supposed parts we wont get from china??? Because of Tariffs, the parts are Junk, look at how many planes have caught fire, fell outta the sky, or how about FORDS/GM nonstop recalls on millions of pickups cars, from buying these 2nd rate, defective POS parts, or how many people died from TAKATA AIRBAGS defective, but we kept buying them??? so TARIFF the piss outta China, let them keep there garbage parts, we'll be fine
We have an FAA, FDC, & FDA  called China
China’s loss, they probably sold it already, there’s a backlog of 737’s orders that need to be filled.
That was the. Biggest Boeing order return ever..
And they support 45-47  ya Got what you voted for Be happy
China and Russia makes new planes now. They won't need Boeing or Airbus anymore.
I’m pretty sure Chinas domestic airlines are in trouble and they’ve been try to figure out how to cancel orders.  This is the perfect excuse.  If you follow airplane production, lead times are years, so there a huge line to get planes.  I hear India and other airlines are asking for these planes.
Donald : guys, please buy Boeing stock now and I will force team “kissing my as…” to buy these planes…
Does News Corporation (Fox News) tell their viewers they fully lied to get trump elected?
Where were these lawmakers and legislatures over the last 30 years of America bending over for China. The only reason they're mad now is because it's Trump. If you shut up and get out of the man's way he will make America wealthy.  You Democrats seem to have no problem with giving away every single dollar that Americans make only to print more. Cause higher inflation and give that away as well. Stand back, watch how it's done and keep your mouth shut!  You had no problem keeping it shut when Biden spent all that money and let everybody walk all over him and give away $350 billion in order to unalive a whole bunch of people halfway around the world. Just sit back and learn and once again because you never understand this, shut up
Cool ..  Now you know how Detroit feels with the Democrats letting every manufacturer of cars dump here and all our jobs being sent out of the country .. we have a bumper sticker here in the Detroit area " hungry ? Eat your foreign car" and the left coast is all about their foreign cars .. but on the bright side ..Boeing got the contract for the new fighter jet .. hopefully made in another state
They must take our products and buy them. That’s how free trade and commerce work!
A win is a win. Right? Riight?
Xi's Air Force One equivalent is a Boeing.  He doesn't even trust his own Chinese planes.
All these business owners and C suite voted for this. They thought they were getting tax cuts now they'll get to pay zero taxes because they'll make zero money when they start to go bankrupt.
This assholes president doesn't care if people are hurting as long as he and his family are doing ok
No penalty for breach of contract?
Trump return too putin
I thought he would be much smarter and better than last time, maybe more experience but god he's completely gone. Damn
Bring back hunter/gatherer jobs!!!
MAGA!!!😂
The peasant returned the airplane back to Boeing…JD sell that plane to India!
I truly believe Americas view's on technology advances were, "We don't have to advance we own the world and countrol governments around the globe". "What we say they have to DO and if they get out of line,we sanction them". Same with buying GOLD, they believed they had no need for gold because their Dollar was greater then GOLD. "Well US government", you dug your own grave and they are still digging. That's why US super rich WANT'S DUMB leaders, "Control them then dump them", "blame them".
Art of the deal bullshit next is mcdonald leaving china
Dont worry, we can manufacture dollar.
*China support the world. they buy and make 90% of everything on earth.*
Oh boy, we are sure being great and winning…
Reject to sender or airplane made in China? 😅😂
This is what happens when you treat your biggest customer with racism, xenophobia and disrespect.   A hard lesson to learn by USA.
China doesn’t want some crash prone Boeing.  Also USA can control China if it has Boeing planes.  All USA has to do is stop maintenance and parts to bully China.  China doesn’t want any of that.  China has its own plane the Comac.
SEND IT TO INDIA AND ENJOY GOOD DEAL!
Screw Trump.
China doesn’t want some crash prone Boeing.  Also USA can control China if it has Boeing planes.  All USA has to do is stop maintenance and parts to bully China.  China doesn’t want any of that.  China has its own plane the Comac.
Awww  that's to bad !!!
Canadian here. Please get your facts straight. The Canadian federal government did not “mandate” that all US alcohol be removed from shelves. This was a voluntary decision by local liquor control boards and supported the majority of Canadians.
Fox news never talks abaut the most danger convicted criminal Trump should be in jail in el salvador not in the white house ⚖🇱🇷⚖🇱🇷⚖🇱🇷
Air Bus will replace them thanks to America electing a fascist.  No one wants American products.
Well,you put him in charge 😂😂😂,perks of democracy
Well, you voted for this.
Don't blame China. All this winning is exhausting.
FAFO Trump. Sadly, it’s the US citizens who pays for your stupidity.
just buy and consume your own products 😅
Booohoooo
Dumpty thinks the rest of the world will bow down to him like the GOP does.  Good for the rest of the world for having a backbone and not bowing down to our traitor in our WH
They are not pulling them back. China cancelled their order.
Trump is wonderful
America made China richer than we are.
MAGA did this! They will be the cause of Americans losing jobs and business closings.
MAGA = Make Airbus Great Again 😊
So to save my stock portfolio from Trump, I have to sell my stocks in Boeing and invest in Airbus? Okay, got it. Good luck Boeing
well ask trump and the gang to buy it
hmmm boeing? isnt boeing airplanes manufactured in china
Have Boeing said thank you to Trump?
Is this part of its going great?
They didn't have to pay double the tariff. They sent the plane back to make a statement, they're done with us. Fafo amigos. Maybe president elon can put all of the boeing layed off employees to work cleaning up launch pads, or maybe Governor Trump can put them to work mowing lawns at mar a lago.
*** Hmmm, Republican Scorecard first 90 days. Dollar has lost 10.5% of its value worldwide!!!!. Dollar may lose it’s role as world’s top trading currency. **** Trump has crashed the stock market, food prices are going up, unemployment rapidly rising, other countries trading with each other and around us, America Alone now. Trump most hated man on earth, other counties stopped visiting USA states, Americans shunned across the world, coming with tax breaks for the rich, 401Ks snd IRAs down 17%…!!!! Severe constitutional crisis due to Trump’s lawless actions and defying Supreme Court Rulings…..Automobile prices up $5000 each on average, 15% of small businesses in risk of bankruzotcy…MAGAs MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?????? Really????
How many manufacturing jobs will be gone? Crap!
Great move China..
Por cortesía de TRUMP
It wasn't the Canadian government that mandated the removal of U.S. wine from shelves, it was the governments of each province and territory that makes these decisions.
I guess it's Return TO American Manufacturing after all
Trump needs to realize that this is not 1990. The world does not remove around the US.
This is perfect! Now american airlines can show their patriotism and by those returned airplanes! Its all working out.😊 🇨🇦
😂😂😂😂😂😂,  what now maga ???
"Reports from tons of international outlets". The detailed and accurate reporting of 2025.😂
The Trump affect can not be  vaccinated against .  USA is dying from TheTrumps
Let’s face it,declining in numbers of travelers into USA is because this country is not appealing anymore!
Oh cool.  Another lesson in relativity.  Action = reaction.  Our flamboyant richard is making things happen.  For the worst.  Again.
Maga, screwing America😮
Oh no the sky is falling....and some couldn't be happier about it
😂😂😂😂 this tariff will make a lot country go china 😂😂😂 to do business 😂😂
This is called an echo.
This is what happens when you vote for Trump. Good luck.
Making America Orange Again
it's not only the typical Maga People that Voted for him but millions of Other People that were stupid to Believe his was gonna make America Great , now Regretting in Silence.   There are few Farmers and Other People that came out speaking out Regretting Voting for him but its too Late for that. The most Frustrating thing is the Democrats are the Minority in the House and Senate, They're Fighting day in and day out , but they dont have the Votes.  There's Noone in the Republicans Party willing to speak out against him and Literally save America. It's a Sad Grim Situation,  The Country is on a Free Fall
Stupid people voted for a stupid president.
China don’t want self distracting Boeing and unsafe plane flying in China with chines people in it. Airbus planes are safe with good safety records. Also chine is making its own planes.
Nice tariff
People are starting to learn that if they want to do business, it won't be while they are based in the United States.
i am surprised you expected different
No problem India first
I laugh now, but this lunacy is gonna catch up.  Climate events, civil unrest, economic despair...this summer could be really unpleasant.
Speaking of shooting yourself in the foot
I support China.
We’re winning, right.? Because he said we would be tired of winning all the time. He’s the orange Jesus right?
China will buy exclusively from Airbus until the Chinese passenger jet C919 is ready. Then no more Boeing for the Chinese market
Someone said Airbus is already so high in demand after the previous Boeing blunders that they're booked for production for years into the future. Companies were only buying Boeing because they're available. Also can't wait for the Boeing F-47 flop after they already proved they can't handle military contracts year after year.
The cause of ALL this disruption is trump not other countries. Take it up with him.  He is causing the crash of your businesses.  No one will trade with the unreliable us now.
Trade War is on! Will MAGA prevail?!
US has way more to gain than lose with China trade. That B737, there is a long waiting list for the type.  Who wants to snap it up so they can fill a gap?  Or retire a old, aging tired, expensive aircraft in their fleet? Boeing will find someone fast for that aircraft.
Terrible Republicans ruining the economy
honestly, even though chinese electric cars are selling well because they operate on land, not many airlines in the world want to use chinese brand passenger planes other than in china itself? so far, world airlines have trusted 2 brands, airbus and boeing.
They should move some production to Canada for cheaper aluminum and better export access to Europe and Asia
Since boeing is not getting sales Is it cheap now?  Can i get it for myself
MISINFORMATION .... CANADIAN HERE ....  The Canadian Government doesn't tell the provinces what to do when it comes to liquor ... or ANYTHING for that matter.  Every decision that has been made regarding products from the USA on government liquor store shelves was done by each individual province.  The Canadian Government speaks for CANADA, not the provinces.  And the vast majority of shippers in ANY store are now boycotting ALL products with a MADE IN USA stamp on it.  It might be costing a little more and we may have to do without, but we are not going to support a country whose leader (if you can call him that) and his fellow flunkies show no respect to any other country.  Let's just hope that the CIA can get a guy who has better aim.  And calling Boeing Field the King Country Int'l Airport is ridiculous.  I wouldn't call it an International Airport, if anything it's a regional airport.  You want International, go to Sea-Tac.  Boeing Field has only 1 public airline, Kenmore Air and the only reason it's international, it goes to Victoria on CHARTER.
I love this... They are in denial
Good to cancel. No choice. Thanks to Trump.
Rubbish news channel - you need to tell the truth!!
This is a good thing. When china caves, it will be much more profitable to sell to them.  But you don't here these selfish, woke, idiots talking about that.  you will not here from these selfish, woke, idiots when the price of imports comes down.  If they want to sell to china so much, why don't they mover there?????
Boeing has a backlog orders of 5-8 years… they could sell this to other airlines. Indian airlines have hundreds of order waiting.
US lose huge earnings. China will always retaliate.
Yeah! Support maga🤮
My next phone won't be an Apple. Hello HuaWei, Samsung. Ditto my computer. Goodbye Netflix and Disney, hello BritBox. The USA has 4.2% of the world's population. Their output won't be missed by the rest of us. I’ve not ordered anything from Amazon since Trump mark 1.
Who needs plane that is poor quality. Its not all about tarrif war. Dont blame China for it. Boeing planes are like time bomb
us will pay  EU will not bow under Americanos #allagainstUSA
Congratulations to MAGA for having a convict President Donald Trump contributing to the demised of the World Terrorist USA's source of all WAR & BIOWEAPONS from AIDS to CORONA did MAGA know USA register CORONA early 2000 long before WUHAN, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump order the released of CORONA in 2019 using MAGA son & Daughter as carrier and I wouldn't be surprised the Eggs shortage is also from him BIRD FLU is it coincident both period are headed by Trump.
THE WORLD AT large has made china a world powerhouse because they realise like Africa they can exploit the chinese people,Whats different between africa and china is,🥁🥁China used its revenue from all countries that exploited their cheap labour to upgrade their manufacturing tools,their country and their way of living at large,🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳Now china looks literally like a futuristic Cyber punk nation full of technology beyond ,America/Trump is jealous.Imagine you have exploited nations all over and your country still looks like a 3rd world nation😂😂😂😂😂😂,China turned the game on its head
peasants not need this
The more the US bullies others...the more the US will be isolated and will lose...
Just the beginning ..... oh look at Wall Street again  Australia stands with Canada 🇨🇦 Ukraine 🇺🇦 and now China 🇨🇳  Here in Bangkok I like my TEMU free deliveries and import duty FREE 🛫 📦 Eggs here 15🥚80thb (~$2.4) 30🥚110thb (~$3.3) 😙
So much winning!
Oh well if China can put tariffs on us we can put tariffs on them so deal with it all you cry baby Democrats😂
Fox: NO!!! CHINA need US!!!! Haha
anyone who voted for trump and his billionaire friends is a dumbass
Does America feel great already? Can we stop with the nonsense?
Keep it
Think about brics when currency goes on. It will be the end of an era.
good for china..this aircraft and boeng itself is untrustworthy to fly...chinese people are safe.
Are we winning?? Asking for a friend
Boeing has a 737 backlog of almost 5,000 AC
My god!!! We never stop winning.
Good
Trump is sure to FUCK UP our economy. This is a 50 million dollar liability for Boeing. Get ready for prices to go up. China will win this war.
Taking US booze off our shelves was not mandated by our Federal Government - It was mandated by the people who did it.  We people are fighting back and our government stands behind us - not in front of us like MAGA
Wait for all the F-35’s to get cancelled. Thanks again Don!! About the only thing we still make better than anyone else and you’re 🤬ing that up too!!😡
How Donny will build an economy without buying American products? He thinks Chinese will bend down...
Hey, once America is great again, you’ll be able to make and consume your own stuff.  Hang in there guys!
This reporter and interviewer have yet to do their homework before going to the camera. Canadian Federal Government didn't stop american alcohlic drinks.  It's the provinces and consumers who show their dislike in response to d-trump's insult, threat, abuse and bully.
Trump strikes again fafo
Airbus can produce an A320 45 in a month but jet engines take 2-5 years with 25,000 parts. China can go with them but can Airbus deliver on time? While China waits, there airplanes get older and more flight time. Is that safe?
Trump is destroying America.  We have no more friends or allies.  China will become stronger because if this, and we will become weaker, it is obvious.
There was Cold War, and now we're witnessing the beginning of Cold War II.
Peasants don’t buy your boeing. 😂
Make America great again😊😅😂❤
WOW!  I'm surprised a Boeing jet was able to fly both ways without losing a part, catching fire or simply flipping over and crashing!  One of the better Boeing jets.  Your loss China.
God for you US
The biggest safety for mankind! GETTING TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT DROPPED PLANES, FALLING PARTS, DOORS OR ENGINES FALLING OFF IN MID FIGHTS.
FUCKING COMMERCIALS
This is what happens when you put A Freaking 🤡 in the White House!!!
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
The U.S. is not going to win against China. The Chinese are now boycotting U.S. goods, not just Boeing, everything made in the USA they are not buying at the department stores and grocery markets to support their government to win the war. That's what they said, "We can eat grass for 3 years, even if 30 million died. Can the U.S. go without our cheap products for 3 days? We have 1.4 billion strong, bring it on." Americans do not support their government like the Chinese support theirs. The U.S. cannot win.
How are you FOX bootlickers going to spin this, the latest fallout from Dumpty's insane tariff rampage?  I suppose you'll somehow make it all Hillary's fault?  🙄 Trump is doing exactly what he said he would.  (But FOX didn't report that , did they?)  And now all the MAGA snowflakes are crying tears in their Budweiser.
Trump isn’t looking for a fair deal.  A fair deal still put China on top trade wise
Told ya so....... Hilarious
Generous return policy.
That was the 100% best thing to do as Trump trying to treat the world like his own.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Air India will take them all...
Looks like good wine. No big deal we lose sales. Just have the growers drink more wine. They will be happy.
If the China planes crushed and crumbled  with passengers we can’t do nothing about it if Boeing planes crushed then families  of passengers can sued against the Boeing factories .
Trump’s company is privately owned not directly impacted by his tariffs
Boeing's forever off China's market, great news.  Trump will not be whining China's ripping off America.
You voted for Trump.
boycott
Airbus happy to sell 8500 planes now that China cancelled all these orders and KLM and a Spanish airline also cancelled so 160.000 jobs in Seattle are on th elite good 👍 job Donald 😂
Y'all fafo and are finding out! China said they're in for the Long Haul. They've been here for 5000yrs, and, they'll be here for another 😅😅! Fafo 😂
suck it up you greedy BSTRDS
US = low quality
China do not need America for anything. America needs China for everything
Come on folks !  It's short term pain for long term gain!  That is if you still have the lights on!  A local strings musical intrument store just announce a 30% price increase starting next month.
Surely there must be a buyer in the US who can pick up the slack.
Trump is the problem but don’t forget that the administration is equally to blame because they support Trump and his decisions none of them challenged him at any time because they are all white supremacists…. so when you make a complaint use correct wording “Trump Administration” we need to call them out make them all accountable.. they have no where to hide.
HOW DARE CHINA RETURN OUR BEAUTIFUL BIG PLANE THAT IS AMERICAN MADE BY BOEING THE BEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD.
To all the people who voted for Trump, thanks a whole lot.
Thanks Trump
Domestic enermy!
Art of the deal
The Tariff is real when you want to buy a Toshiba battery for $2, and they charge $200 for delivery fee!
Lol😂 all these countries have been robbing America, its there turn
FAFO
Imagine that. Trump bankrupting Boeing.
The end of USA Hegemony has arrived. AIPAC Zionist President Trump is worried.
Trump don't care😂😂😂
He made Mmurica a great mess again; even greater than what it was.
Good, if Trump's pointless tariffs send America's economy into the toilet perhaps Americans might think twice before electing another crackpot moron to the white house.
Trump is crazy
Another Donald duck mistake
Fook you yt again
But " we are gonna be so reach" Trump and his repeating high schooler Karoline Leavitt!
Gordon Chang should be FED chairman, he seems to be very bright person. Petition for Gordon Chang.  :)
MAGA 😂 Trump thinks America is untouchable haha until he fucked up China. 😂 China has been in this world for thousands of years, they will survive thousands more.
US logic "when u can't compete, u sanction them and bully them". This time it backfired
Planes being sent back and Mack Truck laying off many in PA....hold on to your wigs people! We're in for a bumpy ride.
When you voted for Felonius, who also wrote the Fart of the deal
Putin’s Twink is beyond incompetent.what a clown show.
India will buy all of them , there is a severe shortage of planes in india
Trump is running his presidency as if it’s his own business. Trump is a devil in the making.
You reap what you sow
Hey China. Europe has excellent wine. Whether it's white wine from Germany, red wine from France, or Italy. We Europeans also have very good beer, especially the unique Guinness from Ireland. And you Americans with your already completely overpriced domestic products. So this is what Making America Great Again looks like? Good luck with that.
Congratulations, that's what happens,. when you have Dumb and Dumber, allowed to vote and they elect incompetent, Congressman Senators, and evidently presidents., make no mistake they will do it again in 4 years.
Companies want cheap labor and china kick out those air plane company.
Relax.  Thats just part of the transistions🤣
lo what's China going to use , their own jets lol.
China calm, Macron.
Not a problem.  They'll just paint them and deliver to other customers.
This is what Trump wanted. Self manufacturing for self consumption. US can stay locked down while the rest of the world trades happily.
737 Max...please return back...
still waiting for that phone call donnie?, good luck with that. guess he's realizing how hard it is to run a country from the seat of a golf cart.
Well, half of ya voted him in so.... #winning 😅
Good news. Lower prices for us people buying stateside!
China doesn’t need the U.S.  one bit. Yeah it would be nice but if you push them …nah. Ask Washington apple farmers how trump’s tariffs worked out the last time. Once you lose a client you aren’t getting them back. As far as Canada I support them boycotting US products and travel 100%.  Trump voters you’re going to get exactly what you wanted (and deserve).
US empire will fallen soon, because no country want to kiss trumph ass. Trumph to arrogant and make china great not US
Well... Say thank you to the Orange Mussolini. And unfortunatly this is just the beggining of bad news for Boeing and other american companies.
USA is turning North America with North Korea as a reference
Malaysia want buy the airplane,but in less quantity.
There were a lot of people who put this guy in office. Who is going to put him in jail?
Nobody will be dealing with America soon is the art of the deal
One jet? Watch US stop fentanyl mail from China.
China's factories are closing and massive job lost!
Make USA great again?
Yeah, “Art of the deal” in action 😂
this is just GREAT ! 😒
MAGA comes with sacrifice, buckle up America!
Ludicrous
USA Airline also sent back AIRBUS plan delivered.  What's the Problem when China following USA Democracy and Freedom action！？
"MAGA" Making America Great Again= MAGDA". Make America Great Depression Again....
Good! Other countries get better delivery. For cn, this act will ground their entire fleet.
Buyers REMORSE.
Thanks
Good reporting! Way to go!!
Thanks for the good news!
good for china, they will only travel by foot or cycling
Don't think it's temporary. Trust has been destroyed. A bad taste has developed in the mouth.  Negotiators have been insulted as waiting to kiss his soiled ass. The revulsion is so intense that many are willing to sacrifice a decline in their standard of living.  Don't view foreigners as Americans. They react differently. Say bye bye to US exports.
Just saying as a Canadian... Great news! Last I checked ALL the biggest business leaders from Washington state donated millions to Donald Trump and were at his inauguration. So, please stop the whining and complaining.  P.S. I'm in Montreal, Quebec and it's so true about American wine, spirits, you name it NOT being sold here in Canada, anywhere. You Americans are losing billions of dollars in sales. Congrats!
Go china 🇨🇳 go china send  more massages to king trump and he’s maga. That tariffs don’t work !!!!
0:35 on the runway… more likely the apron lol
Awesome.
you done f it up felon 45
You don't make deals with a thug, a liar, a degenerate. Get rid of the buffoon you have in the White House and we will start talking business.
Thank you America  king trump and maga  that’s your tariffs
America will have so much wine ..
That's okay this is what you all wanted. Don't get upset. Be happy!
That’s what you get when you elect a felon with zero brain function!
Americans think they live in the Marvel universe with superheroes protecting them but the rest of the world do not.
🍊🤡 is going to bankrupt the US just like he bankrupted his 6 companies.
Trade wars are easy to win.  stable genius
Duh
Trump is a failure as a president and I can't believe America voted for this well at least I didn't
Oh so china was trade partner
Thousands of BOEING  direct 😢workers will be soon out of jobs, not to mentions those subcontractors! So sad just bcuz of one man voice! 🤕🤕🥵🥵😥🥴
I wonder when the plane arrived back from China, whether Trump made Boeing pay the tariff to bring it in from China 😂
We will no longer buy American products and services.  Support a worldwide boycott of all American made goods to stop these tariffs.
America fall for trade war.
Dont worry dont worry. Its all the art of the deal
Several days ago, Trump literally said that several of the countries to which he had applied the new tariffs were "kissing his ass"... This is the "kiss" that China has sent straight to his ass.
more boeing for us.....hopefully Boeing got a big deposit for this order.....
trump said he wants America first, and the world is giving him what he wants. Trump will learn the hard way that the world doesn't revolve around America 🤣🤣🤣
We will no longer buy American products and services. Support a worldwide boycott of all American made goods to stop these tariffs and spread this message.
Now american realize usa is not the center of the universe
Little donnie is happily destroying the US. He owes putin for the 2016 election. He owes the billionaires for 2024 and let's not forget 2025(theil). He's destroying us without firing one gun. Fux helped make all this happen, it cost them 800 million.
We will no longer buy American products. Support a worldwide boycott of all American made goods to stop these tariffs and spread this message.
FAFO
Far-Q A Mary Can't
It's the maintenance contracts and parts for repairs that will hurt the US in the long run.
Hell I’d return it two, it’s Boeing.
None runs a country like a store shop.
Good 👍 such a genius Trump🙌
When america is sick...the world gets a cold!!
You asked, they listened.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
President trump thank you for creating check and balances in  this world about time my kids and family thank you very much we understand the end gold and we are willing to pay more in the beginning how ever in the end we will have the lowest prices  in planet earth
it's China's lost, where else can they get a plane with outstanding features like : May Crash Any Second Auto release door plug.  Auto loosen bolts.  And other, God Knows, latest inventions? Auto release landing gears perhaps?
Impeach & Remove.
They had enough fuel to return?
Dangerous plane. Is a trojan horse.
PROUD TO BE AMERICAN! Why?
Chase 40'000 jets as long as you want! I hope for you that this opportunity is U.S. only....lol  The rest of the world hates Trump and this government and subsequently will buy elsewhere....
donal m0ng0s willl ruin us
Good!
I bet all Chinese cars have GPS info that is used for war... 😢😢😢
USA realizing that there are more countries in the world and that they don't like bullies. 😄
Are you guys great yet ?
The world is laughing at you. We can no longer trust you or take you seriously.
Chumps America. MAGAts 🫵🏻😂🍿📉
zero smpathy....you voted for this.....see ya in 4 years.
This stupid, so called President, I mean, it hurts to even calling the orange turd that. Is beyond belief! A failed bankrupt running America, you couldn’t make this shit up!
LET ME TRANSLATE TRUMP IS F&CKING INSANE !!!! -- From an economics standpoint, many experts say Trump’s view of how trade works is outdated at best. It is true that inflation-adjusted median earnings did experience a multi decade period of relative stagnation starting at the end of the 1970s. And for men, median earnings have actually been flat for the past 45 years.  But over the past 10 years, they have steadily increased for both sexes. And while the United States does have a large trade deficit, it remains a manufacturing powerhouse whose exports have never been more valuable even after adjusting for inflation.
The boomerang effect is just starting...
😂😂nice
Mak america grat agin ! Way too go mr. presidant this is werkin good
Breach of contract
Good
We are currently in the dark age of American history. It will be 20 years or so before we get out of it.
You do realize that you’ve elected the dumbest possible person 🤡 to be in the white house … 😂😅
isolation-here we come baby.  idk about the rest of you but i am getting tired of winning.  woohoo!
Any country who show weakness and throw themselves to trumps mercy ar italy first stupid country with no respect. fools
Stand UP THANKS TO TRANSGENDER TRUMP AND MUSK
Donald Trump is the most stupid president ever in history of human kind.
guess this is what America calls winning?
How many new manufacturing jobs, anyone? Is there a projection over the next year for new jobs, anyone?
4years is around the corner
40.000plamed nonody is going to have a job to trabel on a plane start to use your brain america wake up no job no money no house no wife defonately no air travel
Covid like crisis for 2025,  hope US change their trade policy.
Oh well we don’t need yall
You support an orange now you got karma
Remember trade war are easy to win
The Americans : but the world needs us right?  😂
Even if Trump reverses the tariff, the damages have been made. China is no longer buying from the USA.
LOL 😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe we should sell Fox News to China. Fox propaganda should fit in better there...
Is Donald going to ask Congress to bail out Boeing or ask them to eat up the cost? What a clown. 🤡
For national security, USA keeps the plane or donate to Russia for free 😊😊😊😊
LIBERATION DAY- Declaring a state of emergency during an economic boom and taxing US citizens by means of tariffs thus creating a national and worldwide financial crisis. Meanwhile the crony's, yes men and butt kissers remain non critical  and supportive of a completely unplanned, elementary and egotistically tailored idiotic idea!
Salvador Air may be interested…
BOEING JUST GOT TRUMPED !
Vivré Airbus 🙏
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 YOU voted for it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A great victory for our great leader and our MAGA, Donald Trump. What Trump achieved in a month, no other leader able to achieve in the past 100 years. Trump is going to eliminate all the taxes when dollar becomes zero and worthless.
Maybe China’s Xiamen Airlines just can't afford 250% tariff?
Funny that had no problem turning around
United red states of Trump all that bastard cares about
From Australia mate you lot must be just so sick of winning 😂😂
Is this why China has been investing heavily in high speed trains to move their people at high speed from province to province, or city to city  to eliminate domestic fights?
China cancelled Boeing orders of over ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE BOEING PLANES.  They will now buy the AIRBUS. Well, there goes tens of thousands of jobs, swirling down the toilet we now call the United States of America.
Support your Country! Stand with the USA why are you so divided America
luv Xiamen air. Took a regional from Shenzhen to Chengdu a few years ago. Best food package vegetarian, real cutlery. manzano banana., very friendly flight attendants. However, i must say the other passengers were incredibly rowdy for chinese people, maybe Szechuan people speak loud.
Time to buy Airbus stock!
Boeing, don't worry, nobody knows planes more than trump he has owned  them, big ones smalls ones short ones tall ones. He'll get Americans to buy at our local airlines dealer. Making America Great Again😢😢
manual not included ?
Fox News sniffs Thumps farts and licks his arse
Way to go Trump😂
Ask the clown (king trump) are we so sick of winning yet?  Elected a clown and we have a circus. Are we feeling great yet?
Anti-American thesis - the tariffs are very good for the US
Who will pay for the plane? Mexico.
" Emotional Damage.....!"
#freedumb
You voted for him America, right? He's hurting everyone in the world. First in line? His own people; his billionaire buddies will enjoy the tax cuts though. Buckle up; this is only 3 months in. There's another 45 months to look forward to.
An actual Manchurian candidate couldn’t do a better job of tanking the US economy.
Who  can afford to pay 125% tarrif my chinese goverment? Better get fine for breaking the contract than paying that amount of money. If the jet cost 100 millions, the buyers will need to paid the total of 225 millions if they want to keep the plane.
Putin has great jets for sale
Freaking awesome 😂.    China doesn't need us statement.  We still owe them 700 billion 😂
Is it me or is that port looking completely deserted? Truckers are going to be laid off in the US soon. MAGA wanted this. They’re getting it! FAFO!
Boeing rhe death trap.sold in pieces around the world ..Garbage .
That’s the president you choose,so enjoy it….enjoy & make america great again.
So that means an improvement in safety for Chinese airlines.
Go Trump! Doge!
Resell
Trumps and his dogs are stupid.
Why cannot you sell these planes to Endia? Because Boeing hired Endians to work on her planes and the quality is lower than a dumpster. You cry that Boeing's quality is going down. Yes, that's true and that's because the ill-experienced Endian labor and ill-experienced overseas Endian manufacturers.
You people will get to see how long you were hoodwinked by China and their control over western American democrats. Fools.
😂😂 good now they don't have an airplane,
Sorry, we don't want your product anymore.
All this BS because orange man wants to raise government income to offset cost of tax breaks for the wealthy. In other words, a transfer of wealth.
A smart person will not spit into the well from which he drinks.
It's not a coincidence. Seattle is the Chinese Hong Kong. Chinese Taiwan. Of the West.
The U.S. is in decline
There is no legal Precedent for this ! ... There is NO Constitutional Protection against a Criminal Cartel in  Washington DC  .... The Precious American Constitution Authors never imagined a TRUMP Criminal Cartel & it's Oligarch Capitalist Parasite takeover of Washington DC .....   It is now a Global Terrorist , Thieving & Murdering Cartel ..... After nothing is left in the Treasury or Fort Knox ......  Now it is committing Economic TREASON against it's own Citizens .....
Hopefully that Airline will buy an Airbus instead. 🙂
FOX news, this is great right? 😅
Trump was to stop all china
Seattle legalized fentanyl. For last 20 years, democrats under Chinese leadership. Have sold the country out
Recently China bought 240 million ton of soy bean 15% cheaper than USA from Brazil. Before trade war, China bought expensive soy bean and inferior Boeing from USA to offset some of the trade deficit. Now China do not have to buy those from USA anymore.
Stop crying Boeing.  We are here because you’re greedy of profit over American people.
I can't imagine anyone running for President in 2028. Imagine trying to fix this shit show? it will takes years and years
The world HAS moved on without america not could or might but HAS,  it is not just BC in Canada  that has stopped american liquor  it is the whole country. america is in deep crap but does not seem to have realized that yet. maybe stop listening to the con artist in the oval office.
Boeing has lot of orders.i don't think a new company csn replace boeing in 20 years also.thays how advanced their avionics and investment capacity on research is
China already defeated America in a political war. Through democrats that have destroyed us from within and neglected rest.
Our orange scumbag president gets worse every day.
You're in the Find Out stage of the Fuck Around part.
All these trade issues could be stopped tomorrow if the countries would simply say that they would treat the US fairly. The world has been so used to taking advantage and abusing the United States regarding trade, they believe they’re entitled to steal our IP and flood our markets with slave produced goods
TIT FOR TAT!!!!!🤑
Didn't learn anything from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. Went on to fight with China another Asian nightmare 🤷🙄
Not to come.. but more to return
You put the looney cream in power
Seattle that legalized fentanyl.  A deadly addictive substance that is sourced from Chinese labs.   China legalized opium . When they were forced to by u.k.   After losing a war.
Look on the bright side, US booze will soon be super cheap at bankruptcy asset sales.
So sad America. What your leader do to you. Thnx MAGA yall did it.
Great make America POOR again. ..We have to expect more n more job losses, people who voted for Trump need to rethink n take action.
The idiot orange criminal is definitely doing his job as he is used to…..
Seattle. Also knows as Chinese Hong Kong.
Boeing planes are union expensive anyway. Get to work Washington, get to work.
So much winning, right, magats!! lol!
Y'all may get more jobs but not no buyers 😂😂😂
China has turned Seattle into a dump. Through democrats.
It’s a reasonable decision for China. After the ridiculous tariff, those planes are extremely expensive compared to airbus and other options. Also, all the accidents that happened in the last two years. 😂
America is gonna need another president to make America great again.  Trump, what a loser……
If China wants to fight back, we can always order Boeing to cancel shipments of spare parts of their planes to China. That will really hurt China.
lol.     #CanadaStrong.❤🇨🇦.   #BoycottUSA.
You guys voted for a Musk - Trump govt so suck it up and stop whining.
The good people of Washington did not vote for Trump.
Elect a clown expect a circus.
I all hear is how you guys hate trump and his policies and how you support foreign slave trade. I thought democrats were for the people. Well I guess if you own em the its kinda the same. 😅
Boeing, Boeing, Gone
Please get it right all alcohol sales in Canada are provincial  So he pissed of the feds, tariff response only and 10 independent governments pulled US products. Get your house in order PLEASE
Elect a clown expect a circus
Is also FOX to blame been the Main source of misinformation for the MAGATS .
Whether the Trump effects or affects ? Please remove that mad man from president to save US . 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂❤❤ all things these done by Trump  for israil ❤❤ because, that illegitimate knotty child country is made by Zionist British coloniyals whites their new generation living in USA Canada Australia newsilands and Zionist Jewish from Eroup ? Please.  Dont fire the palace just for a mouse 😢😢😮😢😢😮😮😢
Trump did say, so much winning, winning......
Welcome to Trump’s America 🇺🇸 😂😂😂😂 Peace and prosperity. Promises made, promises kept.
Good, we will repaint it and give it to the next customer in line, dont need china.
Getting interesting by day
Getting interesting by day
the REAL TARIFF WAR started - it is going to be brutal for common Americans -
Ha, Ha, GFYS, get rid of the dummy in the white house and we will talk again
We’re gonna be like North Korea soon, except instead of keeping people out, we’re gonna BE KEPT OUT! We’re also kinda keeping people out too, sooooo……..
That is the result when you have a stupid guy to be the president.
Better to buy Airbus versus the Boeing lawndart.
Oh, Donny.   The mess you are making.
keep it
Comac can produced its own C919, C929 and soon C939, so who wants these tin cans with heavy tariff & detached door inn mid-air, and today, a wing catched fire on way to Orlando (or something).
Bet Americans are tired of winning!🎉
Hahaha....biggest return to sender.     What clown ruins what is working for all.
Trump doesn't understand : Chinese customers buys American at costs Starting from USD1M upwards.. its not that China imports US "Walmart goods" ,,
Trump recession is here, have fun 🇺🇸 you voted for it
Hahahahaha😂😂😂😂hahahahaha
They have cloned it already, stole,every bit of tech on it.
We don’t have to care or think about China at all. Aircrafts are now very high demand and Airlines in Europe and Australia are really need new aircrafts. If Chinese Airlines are unable to afford to buy, Boeing may sell these aircrafts to airlines in Europe and Australia without any doubt. Aircrafts are still new and unused, airlines in Europe will be a lot more happy to buy and no problem for them.
Good News for the stupid Trump
MSM is rooting for China bigly😂🎉
this is all a negotiation  period...this hurts China more then the USA
Boeing keeps on winning 👍
Nah... the world prefer Airbus.
I suspect Airbus will use the advantage of tariff free aluminium to drive Boeing out of airline production. The F*ck Trump jet, sorry, the F-47 will basically be a taxpayer bailout. It will be really expensive seeing as no countries will trust your weapons, and you'll be paying for them all by your lonesome.
Trump is destroying AMERIKAN enterprise!… Time to have him removed!
WHO WILL WORK ON NEW FACTORIES? MAGA? BRINGING MORE INMIGRANTS?
Don't forget to include Canada tourists to US dropping 50 percent, cancel investment in US, cancel all purchases of US military equipments, F35, radar system, all Provinces removing all US wines from the sales floor.......more and more and ongoing Thanks Trump
They ain losing cause Boeing is a Disgustingly Greedy country they shouldn't even be building Planes till they meet all the Stipulations they are literally killing people and Whistle blowers smh
Keep faith in Trump, LoL  An era of depression is upon us.
Congratulations ❤❤❤
how can we be so great if we owe $$$$ -36,217,073,105,000
Ding ding...another valuable asset goes broke. Said Trump..."I won at golf...."
Why is everyone acting like they can't turn this around and sell it someone else LMFAO its a brand new plane
This is just the beginning.
China has Aluminum bolls... India got Clay
Make Airbus Greater...cuz  Boeing was **** anyway
HaHa
So much winning.
If Trump says they’re kissing his ass then you know the opposite is true.Here in Canada 90 % of Canadian,s aren’t buying American products multiply that by 90% of the countries and you pretty much shove your products upwards where the sun doesn’t shine.MAWA ,make America white again ,you sick,sad country
Fyi we dont wanna buy your goods now or weeks ago
Again, maybe do a little research - provinces make rules about linquor, not federal.  Of wait, it’s Fox - no research necessary - just lies and innuendo.  You bought Donald, you wear Donald.
if putin was made potus in january he could not have infiltrated and destroyed america  quicker or better that orange man did ..thats a fact
You should check the reg in the photo then look at the reg for the plane that fits the description
And you Americans thought that King George III was insane.  Then you went ahead and elected the Trumpster, TWICE.
Boycott America, Make America Go Away President among other accomplishments.
The thing is: US needs China but it's not the other way around, China does not need US.
CHINESE SCAMMERS
Now airbus takes over.
All good. Art of the deal you say? 😂
🇨🇦 😂😂 ELBOWS UP. 💙
Xiaolin Showdown tie-in for a Domestic Airline perhaps? 😔
Yup why don’t you talk to your daddy trump. O buy the way I’m betting you voted for orange face
Thank goodness America is great again 👍👍👍
It's really foolish that Boeing didn't consult with Chinese airlines before sending all their planes there, only to be rejected. It's like traveling a thousand miles with flowers and gifts to see your girlfriend, only to be turned away at her door. 😂😂😂😂😂
Boeing is done. Trump destroyed another company. Not even his. Now the domino's fall and Maga gets to see what blind allegiance to a buffoon gets you. I hear every fast food chain is working on creating everything they sell from soybeans. For those who thought the rest of the world was gonna stand by and be bullied by the USA because some idiot came up with an equation explaining how Americans were getting screwed by every country in trade are gonna get to be great again. Greatly embarrassed by your sheer arrogance
That is  Exactly what  Trump wants.   Trump wants to end all business with  China.  And put all American suppliers to China out of business.   This is the smart one that the  Americans voted for.  So now enjoy the repercussions of  Putting a Rogue Criminal in the Presidential seat.
If trump wanted to help The USA instead of his rich buddies he would have removed tariffs .
Trump says you don't need anyone    . You can sell your alcohol and lumber and planes in the USA . All is well
So, are americans tired of the lies of thier convicted felon president? Not only to you have convicted felons in your prisons, you give them the top job in your country.  Shameful
Keep your trash USA, nobody needs it in Canada. We'd rather buy Airbus jets, jets that don't fall apart every other week. They also come with the added benefit of not getting blackmailed and bullied.
EVEYTHING that comes from fox, is suspicious......lets find out the real motivation of this "return"....
The  Chinese airline had no choice but rejected the jet due to the tarrif. The price + tarrif make the jet too expensive.
IT'S TRUMPY FAULT HE IS SCREWING THE ECONOMY MAGA MORONS VOTED FOR THIS HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE USED DUMB ASSES
Making Boeing Poor Again 😂
IMPEACHMENT is the only way we survive.
Trump is making the rest of the world united and great again.
Poor Boeing. They can’t make an extra 10 billion this year. Cry me a river.
They done copied the specs already because their Corrupt Chinese propaganda
So....Americans rather be workers than consumers - fools the whole world was your slaves and you got jealous and you want to be a slave you're going to regret it. The people that voted this man in are not going to be around to deal with the consequences I don't think Trump would live long enough to see the damage he's going to cause when you're on Social Security your house is paid off and you have no worries in the world you're having the time of your life right now just watching people suffer whole  enjoy it because everybody knows that the house and Senate  will flip he will not have four years  He has another year and a half and he doesn't get to be president again so he better get to it.
Okay but did Boeing try saying thank you even once?
If Xiamen Airlines took the plane, it will have to pay 125% tariffs incoming from USA to China.. and who wants to pay 125% on a Jumbo Jet?
Remove him from office before he turns America in to his bankrupt casinos 😂😂 ,,you MAGAS voted for this and you thought on fruits and vegetables would be affected well I guess you’re leaning the hard way or easy way, oh I don’t know only you red hat wearing freaks know
What amazes me is that no one has told Trump why US manufacturers moved their production lines out of the US. It's like they are getting a bye while the rest of the world gets tariffed.
Trump tariffs? you lose.
Permanently shut down "djt-the rapist" by any means possible!
My husband is a manager at Boeing.  Don’t worry America, his company has not been affected here in Canada.  🇨🇦  Don’t worry USA.  Trump will figure out how to raise some more distant tariffs and alter a few more things.
He has done Canada a real big favour......oil which used to go to the US (apparently 20% of US production) is now being re-routed to India, Europe and China.   The big kicker though is that Canada was giving away oil at a 20% discount to the US.   We can now get 20% MORE for the oil.   Thanks Emperor Donald !!   You said that Canada was exploiting the US......ha, ha, ha You were getting a 20% DISCOUNT off Canada you tool.
More Trump BULL SHIT he needs to be removed from OFFICE...............................................................................
DT you must remove impeachment  this felon or USA DEPRESSION  YES DEPRESSION
america, the new Russia.
Boeing SUCKS button…..
China "needs" US Airplanes badly and can't afford it with tariffs, which is exactly Trump wanted, China has officially folded their hand. Trump 2028! Masterstroke...
Boeing layoffs on the way. hahaha and Indiana is a Trump MAGA state.
Well one aircraft is only a couple of hundred million US dollars.  Trump should buy it out of his personal bank account, after all Trump is to blame for this.
That was china alone. Imagine if the world stepped buying Boeing aircraft. If Trump was a CEO,  he would be fired in no time.
(CHUCKLE) 🤭🤭🤭🤭 STILL GOT 3+ YEARS LEFT WITH THIS JACKASS!
Wait until iPhone being ship back😂
Was it full of peasants ? Hillbilly's ? Just one ?
Weak dollar is great for American exports, most commenting dems are illiterate here...
People are unhappy about Trump's actions on the China Trade. So here's an Idea  :   Why don't we just Skip it, take a Break, and deal with it in 10 years? By that time the Trade imbalance with China will be in the 2 Trillion range, and China's economy will be so addicted to Us that change would mean Regime Change . . . And then the CCP can concoct a war.
80% of these business owners have always voted republican boeing is a big backer of republicans i shed no tears for these business who reap what they sowed.
boeing gave trump a bunch of money btw... smdh
We do not need Trum
😅😅😅 Enjoy....and keep sending your taxpayers' money to Isreal.  😊
If my biggest customer return all my product,s I would be worry about the future of my business
Thoughts and Tariff's
Let China make their own planes. Temu style.
Rumors say Boeing is talking about firing thousands MAGA🎉
China can sell to other bidders with discount prices.  Than those middleman will sell them to usa for higher prices.  Consumers will pay eventually.
It's time to bring pete hegseth back to fox news.
The world needs nothing from USA and its showing good boy donny
Americans playing victims again.  Colour me shocked.
People this is alleged gaslighting from a Anti-Trump organization, so take it with a grain of salt.
our new trading partners .. sharks & Alligators  in Florida, Bears in Alaska ,  Bison in Wyoming,  Elk in Virginia ... Ohhh we are great again . Forget Canada, Europe, South America, America, we can trade locally
I love it! You magats still he's gonna maga? You fools.
Call the Orange Cheeto about how much money is being lost.
You weren’t so concerned when you demanded congress to impose a 300% tariff on Bombardier’s C Series aircraft.  That’s karma biting back hard ! 🇨🇦🤝🇨🇳
Most people in the U.S. don’t know that the country is soon out of its stockpile of rare earth minerals that are needed for electronic, auto, aviation, satellite and military industries. China produces more than 95% of the world’s total of rare earth minerals and the country just announced to restrict export of them to the USA! This is just the beginning.
TeeHee
MSM will only report negative news. They are own by Soros!! Wake up you fools!
Trump: China paid deposit though🎉
Trump is a Russian asset. He has no concepts of a plan to make the US great at all.
Is this Fox coming to grips with the negative impacts of tariffs? What a revelation! Most of us had figured it out a few months ago.
Canada should build a wall.
Boeing has more to worry about from local taxes than Tariffs on/from China.
What happened to all that money that would pour in due to Tarrifs? Are you tired of winning?. McKinley Read a history book. And Andrew Jackson?. Author of the Indian removal act.Trumps favorite Presidents Now he still rails against Biden. And Canadas prime minister and Frances leader and NATO .And vompliments dictators. And El Salvadors leader is his friend..What the hell happened to our country.. Congress? The Supreme Court?.The FBI?.The Army? A huge march on the Capitol?. Someone please stop this madness.World Courts?. Psychiatrists? I need to shut up before I am disappeared..Did.anyone hear me. Americans Unite.Plesse 🇺🇲🌄🔥🇺🇸🚀❤️✈️🤠
This is what Americans voted for.  If Washington state is not happy it's time to leave the union.
Yes!! Go Trump!!!
Is this how we bring jobs back to America?  By eliminating customers via a trade war?  Can a MAGA supporter please explain this to me in detail?
The world did not start this stupid tariff war but your ignorant president and his cronies did.
Instead of building relationship between US and China...Trump destroy it once and for all....Hehehe.  The US imported from China ($439bn USD) than China imported from America ($144.5 bn USD).  https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html  This is what many Americans do not know. In 2022, US companies earned $1.19 trillion USD in profit globally, with China contributing $0.42 trillion USD. In 2024,  the Corporate Americas in China earn half a trillion dollars.  Annually Corporate America makes tons of money in China.  In 2022, Chinese companies invested $28.7 billion in the United States, and the total market capitalization of Chinese companies listed on major U.S. stock exchanges was $848 billion as of January 8, 2024  It would appear that the US and China are going to a complete decoupling. If the US govt D-List all Chinese Companies and ousted all Chinese companies from the US....They will sell all the assets worth $ 850 Billions and then US lost China market $500 billion USD annually along with the import and export both ways. So Technically there will be no US companies in China and no Chinese companies in the US. We are back in 1950-60s era.    The Chinese are holding US debt $759 Billion USD and As of February 2025, China's foreign exchange reserves totaled US$3.240 trillion USD. If there are no trades between 2 countries. China will dump all the USD. Then the US interest rate will go up to the roof while the US debt is in $ 37.6 Trillion USD. China Debt is 15 Trillion USD.   The next day the many of international companies and local Chinese companies are waiting in line on taking over the vacuum that the US companies have left off. It is a business opportunities. All of these investment that the US has been making for the last 50 years will go out in flame and other countries will rip the benefits.   Who can sustain and endure more pain and suffering in the brink of economic collapse or who will loose more? Both will loose for sure. It is too early to tell. We will see. We have 3 years and 9 months left to go. If the complete decoupling happens fast, no flights, no exchange students,  no cultural exchange, no bilateral trade, no communications, NOTHING....both countries go dark for many many years, decades, and centuries to come
Trump 2030 🎉
The USA is ISOLATING Itself from/to the Outside World like North Korea and Turkmenistan. And the World is saying  GO AHEAD.
A great way to support Chinese plane makers; who will now make these domestically and flood the market for cheaper planes. bye bye USA's aviation business.
Very few Canadians want anything from the usa.  Just like usa doesn't need Canada.(your leader told us so)
Those 737 return by china,you just sell it to other airlines.There is backlog on 737 max.
So this plane was imported from China? Does someone need to pay tariffs on it now?
Yeah but will be new jobs from all the factories that don’t exist yet.
Meanwhile China and other countries continue to dump US Treasury Bonds. Here's to tanking the US dollar! 🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂
#ThanksTrump
Slight correction.  The Canadian federal government did not mandate the removal of US alcohol from shelves.  Those were individual provincial government decisions (equivalent to State level), but yes, the vast majority of provinces pulled US alcohol in one day and the shelves are either empty or filled with additional Canadian and international options.  We feel for you but to put this in perspective we lost 33,000 jobs in March alone.  This is equivalent to the US losing 280,000 jobs in one month.   If this continues, the job loss projections in Canada by the end of the year will be 150,000 Canadian jobs which is equivalent to 1.3 millions jobs in the US  Everyday Canadians don't hate our American friends and neighbors and we hope you understand that.
That is the biggest Amazon return in history.
Elbows up! Down with Trump. Down with Dictatorship of America.
no problem. China will buy from Europe's Airbus. Trump is too dumb to understand anything if it doesn't have boobs.
Is America 🇺🇸 great again yet 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤭🤭🤭🤭
The US can eat the return products with the tariffs very nice and crunchy !!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂 man I love America 🇺🇸 and that dumb ass president we got 😂😂😂
More Chinese teens on this page than a video game convention.
If trump the supreme braggard won't release his school records then he probably didn't take economics 101 or flunked it.
Suppose that did not want aircraft that has self crashing technology!
Stupidity Won now we all have to suffer . Thanks MAGA . We Great yet
Hey, MAGA insisted tariffs were great for American businesses
Could all of this be a result of 9% inflation?
What’s the restocking fee on a 737 Max?
Tariffs blowing Boeing, gone
They should have kept it.
We've changed our minds, America. We’re no longer interested in buying your products—and much of the world feels the same. But don’t worry, Trump will assure you everything’s fine, and you'll blindly believe him without question. Willful ignorance has long been part of the American identity; now it’s just more painfully obvious.
Gosh, as an American, I’m exhausted from all of this winning. It’s so incredibly great again, I can’t stand it.
Send it back 🥟🍤🍥🍣🍿🍩🌰🎂🍢
If Trump got rid of the tariffs from the Chinese; they will leave their 60 % taxes on our products- can we really go back to this - PICK A SIDE PEOPLE 😊
I'd be sending stuff back to the USA too, if I had anything American,  most of my stuff is from China and at the price I paid I'm holding on to it all 😁🤨.
Xi apparently didn’t read humpty trumpty’s Art of the Deal book.😂
All you crybabies need to move to China.
♨🧈+🍿
Funny how the business community elected a man who is anti-working class and anti-business.
Can’t blame them. A 737 max? Nobody want to fly in that  🚽
So much winning 🏆
Do you feel the winning yet, winning so much you dont know what to do
Did it get back with all its´s doors?
I remember during the Clinton Administration, economy in US was booming because the lowest tariff in US history.
Only thing youll be😊 chasing is your tail😂😂😂
Don’t you think you should check it for another Virus?
Are you liberated yet
Some might argue that Trump is doing China’s bidding and accelerating its rise to the top—but let’s be honest, he’s far too incompetent to have orchestrated it intentionally.
India could buy them or someone in Europe
Thanks a lot MAGA. Clown in the WH.
CEO wanted a puppet, but they got an orange killer clown.  The ringleader of "Trump's Cirque du so Lame"
Only the US loses, China will speed up their own aircraft manufacturing and Airbus, now the largest airplane builder in the world, is more than capable to supply the twin aisle aircraft China can't currently build right now.
Congratulations MAGAs! You have successfully reduced your deficit by $100millions. Keep up the great works to reduce another few billions.
Who could have predicted that choosing an unqualified and incompetent leader would lead to real consequences? It’s not like the signs weren’t there—everyone saw it coming. Yet here we are. Thanks again to the willfully ignorant MAGA loyalists for making it possible.
I’m working and making my money. Go Trump! Changes sometimes bring some pain
I hear the muffled sobs of the children ...  everyone needs to realize that this benefits the many... not the few .. stop crying.. pull your big kid pants on and have the audacity of hope that things will get better ...
Will  Boeing now open a factory in China?
This News will never be shown on FOX NEWS 🤮✈️😂
Airbus would thank US for the business
Thank trump for that
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
FDJT !        And his "Big Bucket of Stupid" administration.
A product of Mr Trump’s xenophobic policies. I supported Mr Trump but I never supported anything like this.
How do you like Trump now ?
If America wants the hurt to stop then remove Trump and mafia maga…This will only push the US into a depression
Well this seems to be going Great.     😅😅😅
boeing refuses to pay the tariff so China has no choice
The American people just don't get it. The costs are on them as the companies will only pass them onto the consumers.
Are we great again yet?!!
Malaysia is trying to buy these jets. If they have money..
If you dont impeach Trump you end up at welfare
Uh oh, this is not good news at all.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow  America is great again, lot's of materials to consume and use. American buying more local products
How many deals have been signed? [ silence......] thats what i thought!!!😂😂😂😂
I thought Democracy has a self-right mechanism, it is a people choice. Now its has selected a leader that bring kiosk to the world. What is wrong, US people or the Democracy?   One cannot just complain but not looking at what bring them there..
Poor little plane,,, look at it's face,,, how sad,,,,, "don't worry babe it'll be ok" Grate America is just ahead!
We don’t need trump
To be expected, relax it will all work out.
Thanks trump
A 737 like it was a lemon off the lot.   Anyone in the market for gently flowing jet? Should be a steal,  Everyone knows it loses half its value the moment it taxis off the dealers runway.  G-r-r-reat! 🐯
After what Wikipedia and the Boeing downfall documentary showed, it's strange that the chinese even wanted to buy Boeing airplanes instead of Airbus airplanes! But I guess their aviation safety guidelines are not as good as in Europe.
Why was that jet order canceled?
MAGA must be tired of so much winning!
Is America great again yet ? 😂
China will NOT give up. Their trade with America represents less than 2% of their GDP, BUT we import everything from them.
China has been screwing is for decades and now that the US wants to have a level playing field everyone is pissed off ! This is what happened after years and years of Leaders not doing their jobs now where paying the price !
China is now rejecting 300 Boeing Airplanes, and anything made in amerika [LNG, OIL, SOYBEANS, PORK...ETC...] US IS DONE. THE ART OF BEING STUPID TAKES A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. MAGA IDIOT.
Bye China. Thanks Trump.
Boycott Boeing. Boycott Kentucky Bourbon. Boycott America.
😅😂😂🤣😂😂😅😅😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🇺🇸🤡🇺🇸🤡🇺🇸🤡🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🤡🤡🤡
FAFO
The last month has been going rough for America i think it's only going to get a lot more terrible in the future with tourism and tariffs
5 years efter this guy America Will be sitting on diffrent chair. Right next to Argentina!
MAGA🇺🇸🇺🇸😎👍🏻
Foolish policies trying to overturn world trade has unexpected consequences?  Who would have guessed it?
Hahahaaa play dumb games and win dumb prizes!!! CONGRATS !!! You are winning every price !!!! 😂😂😂😂
Trump shot himself and us in the foot!
Why aren't the US companies absorbing the tariffs if they want the sales, after all, that is what Howard Lutnick said would occur when overseas companies wanted to sell goods into the US.
No Boeing jets to the world...that will teach them a lesson for not bending to the USA.
So much winning.
Let China build their own planes.  Look up the Comac C919, Chinese-made commercial airliner.  It's a real piece of junk; not even safe sitting on the ground.  Boeing should stop sending repair/maintenance parts to China; their whole fleet will be grounded in 6 months.
It sucks that blue states who didn't vote for the Orange Monkey are hurting from his childish trade war. Maybe he wants to make them like the poor red states
Trump needs to use the navy to block Chinese shipping and trade routes this will bring Xi to accept his terms
🤣🤣🤣
Maybe Trump wanted to destroy the US all along.
American building CRAP, no one wants it, I guess the factories will be finished being built by next week 😅😅😅😅
That’s what your president wants it
This is what Trump winning looks like, and everyone else loses.
This is not going to end well for America
This will not end well for the US and A. You guys need to do something before that point.
TRUMP is going to build a WALL BRING BACK COAL BE THE KING OF America, and than we are going to EAT THE DOGS
Airbus will struggle to keep up with the added business as a result of this stupidity
No big deal. Sell it to someone else
This is great for US airlines as they can’t get enough new planes fast enough to add to their fleets. I’m sure Boeing will have no problem transferring these planes over to US airlines.
Keep your crap America , the world does not want it and certainly does not need it .
Should never have been sold to China to begin with. China steals all high tech and makes cheap copies putting the original manufactures out of business.
MAGA = Make Asia Great Again 🔥
Penguin called trump that will buy those Boeing planes !
I'm Canadian, looks like he is putting the wine in jail.. lol. Minimum 4 year sentance..all this is caused by one nut job. Or is he the world's smartest man. Lmfao. He says he passed his cognitive test.
Airbus and Embraer as well as Comac are going to eat Boeing's market share for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Waste their time and let them make the product then you cancel the order. Love it. So rhey think the world still wants to trade with the USA after the tariff stunt that made trumps buddies billions. Trade elsewhere
OH WELL THATS how it goes when you vote for trashy trump!!! HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS OR YOU!!!! You were warned in ADVANCE now suffer!!!! 😂😂😂
Vote for garbage and all you get is garbage !   Stop crying and fix the mess you made !!
so much winning with Donald Dump
America voted for the unemployment line .
"To Ceasar what belongs to Ceasar", the US. needs China a lot more than a Trump Administration cares to admit; China on the other hand, Not so Much.
I didn't vote for Trump.  FAFO.
Stable Genius .  God help us.
Next is EU and Canada including Australia 😅
Great news for Airbus. 😊 🇬🇧
Chinas new airline planes are pretty awesome. Vietnam are already got them. So bye bye Boeing.
so LNG, Beef, Soy bean , Boeing , Wine, Rare earth materials hit to zero , America is winning or China is winning? lol , more to come
CHINA JUST SAID "CHECKMATE"---DO YOU THINK 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔PETER NAVARRO BOOK HOW TO DEFEAT CHINA------THIS WAS NOT IN YOUR BOOK, CHINA COMEBACK
Planes, tourists - the US people can enjoy their vacation in the USA, a lot of space and quiet - no tourists from outside - you want your country yours again - you‘re welcome. You can have it, no intention to come and visit - oh yes, it would be an experience to visit a prison as a tourist. No thank you. I keep my money in Europe. So sad. I hope there will be a solution especially for all citizens who lost jobs and have to pay a lot more because of the tariffs.
Airbus right now: 🤣🤣🤣
No need to worry about it. Boeing had a huge number of 737 max orders piled up. It can just give them to the other customers that are in the waitlist to recieve new 737 max jets.
I get warm and fuzzy all over every time I hear about a Trump supporter losing everything !
Tired of winning
Art of deal
Don't they normally fly them to destination for delivery? Interesting that a Boeing 747  is sitting  in a shipping yard.
3yrs 7months to go
So much winning!
Dollar is down, stock market is down, American companies are down, tourism is down. Well done Donald!!
Parked on the Runway 😂
Business people helped put him in the White House. Suck it up.
WINNING
President Trump is the best President! Make the world independent from America again!!!
American products are returning home unsold 😂😂😂
Can we get a giant Trump sticker that says "I did that" for it's tail.🎉
SEATTLE A DEM CITY FULL OF DRUGS , HOMELESS , AND THE CANUCK WEST IS MORE FULL OF DRUGS THAN SEATTLE , CANADA RUN BY THE KING BRITT , THE HEALTH CARE IN CANADA IS ALMOST HOPELESS . OH DO SEATTLE DEMS LOVE THE COMMIES THAT ONLY PAY THEIR WORKERS SLAVE WAGES OF 5 $ PER DAY . THE CHINA FOLKS EAT DOG BURGERS , POOR PUPS , AND GAVE THE WORLD COVID . THE WRIGHT BROTHERS MADE BETTER AIRCRAFT THAN BOEING ! OF COURSE THEY WERE NOT FROM SEATTLE .
Trump is responsible !!!
Of course China will send the planes back. They now have to pay 3x as much for the planes because of the tariffs. I would do the same.
The world is bigger than America.
Go woke go broke
LOL America is fu..ed
USA runs on a blackmail economy, they just use their military to bully other countries, it gives their international lawyers aka politicians a little more leverage
It was the provincial governments of Canada that are in control of their respective liquor boards. They are the ones that took away US products, not the Canadian federal government
"Return to Sender" of an Airplane must be costly
Typical ignorant comments. Reality is this is not a big issue, Boeing has a MASSIVE BACKLOG FOR ORDERS!  They will just repaint it and sell it to another airline.  You over politicized bunch of whiners are just drones repeating your NW community virtue signal, we know you like China and the idea of their government better than the "evil orange man", so why not move there, and why are so many Chinese people coming and staying here?  Check your emotions and community, or are you mad that the taxation of imports might make you have to get a real job instead of selling crap on Amazon made cheap in a place that doesn't follow your virtue signal voting practices and contradictory moral values...  Funny you want more taxes, but when it's done by someone you don't like for reasons you don't really know, in a way you don't understand, you have a problem with it; most of you cliche NW bandwagon commenters are incredibly out of touch with reality.
Yay... we in New Zealand can sell the wine that was going to America, to China without tariff and get exposure in the worlds biggest growing wine market without USA competition.  Thanks USA. 🍷🍾🍷🍾🍷🍷🍾🍾🍷🍷🍾
Are you tired of Winning Yet?
Bankruptcy is on the horizon for Boeing. Ect ect ect.
I for one think all of this is great news and you have yet to explain how it is not
America is in deep trouble. Trump ask Taiwan government to donate to US Treasuries last week.
Trump is such an idiot.
Wow, there's a real epidemic of CCP operatives in the comments sections these days. How much is Xi paying you guys?
LMAO, Like the cheese, America stands alone 😂
Good...MAGA is great... things will sell cheaper locally!
Why do you need Boeing, who needs to fly ouside America? There are still plenty of Pipers, Beechcraft, and Cessnas in the barns across the country. Gosh, there are also some in the Smithsonian.
They don't want JUNKS and a safe destruction technology 😅.
I heard that the penguins are looking to  buy those MAX 737
Boeing jet returns to U.S. from China... Better check it thoroughly for bugs and other espionage devices.
Learn to weld...
Wait until Boeing has to spend 25% for our aluminum.
Good job mr. President Trump for not giving china a plane. Boing should for American only.
Americans need to realize no other countries need stuff from America. you all do realize that.  the question is can Americans survive without the need of other countries. china  is trading with other countries because they are adult enough to negotiate a deal.  no tariff.
welcome to the find out stage
Try and sell it to Trump airlines? Trump wine bars?
Airnus will benefit in new sales
Trump might make America irrelevant!
😂😂 🍺 🍿
I
Trump does not care one bit about all this.  He bullied Vietnam into a trade deal that included a prominent win for the Trump Organization, a $1.5 billion resort development agreement in Vietnam.  The fellow has no ethics, no morals - he will reduce us all to eating grass while he and his fellow cronies strike deals to line their pockets.
Usa sucks Trump.sucks go china
Why is anyone surprised when you voted in a fascist?
Boeing is BOGO through May 15th!!
USA started it with a small punch but China has started choke slamming USA continuously on all directions. 😂.   That mad guy who the US has elected is lit from behind by China. 😂
Trump supposed to be a business man? He's a Jester.
America has been great, will be not so much soon.
The profit of one aircraft far exceeds that of importing hundreds or even thousands of containers from China, and China canceled the order of hundreds of aircraft. Welcome home from China, this will make our country great again.
Oops….this is the meme where the guy riding the bike puts a stick in the front wheel and then hurts his leg
MAGA cult poisoning American economy so oligarchs can buy everything on the cheap. 😡😡😡😡😡
Anybody have any ideas on whose side Trump is on? Maybe FOX could interview Ron Vera for an explanation of what's going on. Where is old Ron when we need him? Maybe Peter Nevaro could channel him with a hand puppet or a Ouija board.
So we FA and we are FO…
Between millions of worldwide tourists boycotting US travel, and millions of global consumers rejecting US goods,  how is this making you great again??  Good luck with that!  MAGA now equals:  Make America Go Away.  Your once great nation is now a pariah!!
MAGA rejoice - cheap wine and planes! What can you wish more for?
Trump’s bullying equals NO SALE BECAUSE OF THE ORANGE 🍊 TURD 💩 😂
Boeing planes are falling from the sky anyway   And killed a whistleblower
Not gonna be a good Christmas this year😢
Trump supporters: I voted for the economy  ._.
#onlythebest
China is cooking. Let's go haha.
Alcohol was pulled by provincial governments not federal.
Boeing is so far behind with orders this will probably benefit them as they can send it to others who are still waiting. Airbus is massively behind too and Comac is still in their early days. So if you want a plane, and China does your options are limited.
America is going down.  Thanks fox "news"
Imagine being Boeing mechanics and you voted for Donald trump lmao  You voted for your unemployment
The plane looks like it belongs to Sound Transit, lmao.
Relax, president trump will sell this jet for 10x more
We ❤what we are witnessing in America, ❤from Ballito 🇿🇦
his must be what MAGA voted for.  Great job!  Well done!  Maybe buy them using GOP secret fundings to help build US manufacturing jobs.
I wish everyone who “DIDN’T” vote for trump could sue the government for damages and losses.
President trump will sell it to the mullahs regime Tomorrow  They are beginning for Boeing's air plane pasengers but they do not wants F 35and F 16 fighter jets
Truly an orange idiot! Ignorant people elect ignorant people! Maga morons one and all!
THANK YOUR KING!!
Trump is a loser!
China will eventually lose this trade war because their biggest customer is the United States. If China does not play fair, then I see India being the biggest winner out of this because of cheap labor that the US just does not have. Also India is not regulated by a communist government.
Karma baby, karma!
Trump is making China great again not America 🤣🤣🤣🤣
No more bailouts
Its amazing that everyone saw this cluster f**k coming, except the genius's that voted him in.
karma for not releasing the 777x
Boeing employees should check to see if Bombardier are hiring.
China makes their own passenger air planes, Comac 919 which is similar the Boeing's 737. What makes you all think they would continue importing a product that they make themselves? It's not any cheaper, it's proving to be as safe, and efficient.
The best president ever. What a businessman
Airbus is 😂😂😂 on the way to the bank - thank you mr. Orange Business Genius.
MAGA - Moscow Agent Grifting America. Trump is a Russian asset. His name is KRASNOV.
america is the BEST in the world, don't worry folks!    all 195 countries will kiss our @ss.    USA! USA! USA!  we have the moral value on this one!
Not just planes. Parts as well.
Boeing is moving out anyway maria because all the taxes you guys decided to pass then you complain about tariffs you can’t get more gas lighting than that
Boeing was already struggling.
Didn’t Russia offer to buy the plane rejects by China?
Now you wish to take back your vote 😂
Strip the paint, paint it in the livery of a domestic airline, problem solved.
Get your dog under control. He's poopin on everybodies lawn. Including your own.
Americans must be getting so tired of winning under Trump.
Well, FAFO.
Its a correction stupid. Unfair trade should never have happened. So. . . . Trump is just dumping the rules.  Starting New, Fair rules that are ,,,,, FAIR,,,,,to everyone. But you want UNfair trade practices to continue. . . Why??
Wouldn't this be good for domestic airlines as they are waiting years for their planes. This could shorten the queue and reduce the wait times for delivery.
If you chased the world respectfully instead of chasing your tail, maybe you wouldn’t be in such a predicament.
Boeing is not being hurt by this. Indian airlines will line up to buy everything China declines. They have hundreds of Max orders and will jump at the chance for early delivery. They did the same during covid. Learn how aircraft sales work. 😂
Boeing is junk anyway.
Fox speaking the truth?  PM trump is in real trouble now.
Repaint it and hand it over to an American airline
Boing is done anyway. COMAC takes over.
Not a good idea to depend from American enemies like China and let them build sensitive technologies so they can steal and even sabotage America.
YES, good job. Send everything back to America.😂. We in Europe don't need American products.
Are you getting the point now?
You can thank your gutless leader for all of this.
The felon is doing BIG things. Don’t know if they’re good but they are BIG, BIGGER than any president before
China intends to BREAK Airbus-Boeing duopoly of passenger aircraft
The only countries you will not find in our liquor stores anymore are Russia and the Russian territory of United States.  That has to say something. 😂
A 200,000 was canceled but what about the billions from us that we spend with then you morron,,,,, Mr President keep the pressure going🦶
And we were told the phones have been ringing nonstop begging for deals
Thanks to the chaos loving voters, we are in trade wars that were unwarranted and the rule of law is threatened by the orange Imperialistic dictator.  We are being left without allies upon whom we can depend because of an isolationist mentality that failed in the early 20th century and will fail again in the 21st century.
Blame Trump.. not the rest of the world…
Must be going cheap, one careful previous owner, Airbus is booming, as Trump has fked the economy for good. People with brains between their legs are now going to beg on the streets 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Reality is going to hurt!
These are flying coffins anyways … this company’s safety record is a joke!
what you voted is what you get.
Don't deal with Communists!
This looks so good on Trump and his regime do you feel great jobs are not coming back to the USA
Might have been a recall as well considering it's a Boeing. 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Usa debe analizar que devolver a china......
To be fair, nobody wants to be in a Boeing jet right now.
This is sad, the real people who do real work is getting hurt.
Boeing is going............. down the toilet.............. AIrbus thanks you Donald J Chump
We don't need China, China needs us. How ever I would drastically scale down the relationship and dependency of them or any country for that matter.💯😎💨.. They are the biggest polutors in the world.  They make crap products that don't last long and so on. They are totally JUNK ANYWAYS 💯 NOTHIN 😎💨🇺🇸
Question: Is it true that the God Bless the USA Bibles are made in China ? Are your hemorrhoid potties made in China?
We Europeans will avoid Boing as well. Airbus will blossom in the future. The US. will loose big on this.
Reuters always sides with our enemy
It is not Trump's tariff war.  Other Countries started a tariff war on the United States, Trump is defending the United States from the war other Countries started.
Seattle is gonna turn into the next Detroit 😂
Make chaos, get chaos. Well, duh.
No one messes with China!
Is this how to make America great again
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. You see, we the rest of the free world, don’t have to put up with the hubris laden stupidity coming from your government. As you will soon see, we’re simply moving on from the US and we’ll do quite well. So build walls all around your country, deport everybody you don’t like and play with yourselves in your little sandbox. The USA is losing influence by the minute and your president is definitely NOT the leader of the free world any more and your currency is also losing its status by the minute. Once again; play stupid games……
Genius people have always been misunderstood by the masses.  DJT is perfectly performing the art of the deal right before everyone, don't question it, but just wait until the final reveal.
Now we can house a bunch of homeless people in these jets. Lfg!!!!
55M returned 🙆🏿‍♂️
The Chinese government informed all Chinese ans Asian countries not to order any American planes
Chinese got COMAC now .. soon they will take over the world like chinese EV
music to normal honest countrys  and nightmares for you guys USA that will bring you to Greatnes in wrong direction
Congrats orange Donnie for further dooming Boeing 😂
Trump is sooo smart! Hes making America great!
Joe Biden burn his A?S to get for BOEING, 9000 planes contract from China but Trump just did not get it how much job it creates.
America first!  Sell all the products locally to Americans.
China doesn’t want tofu planes made by Boeing. I don’t blame tariffs but safety record.
Pamberi nokuyenda mashure!!!!!
Confusing headline, confusing news, confusing comments. Let me find another source.
The world is about to boycott The United States of Chaos
As European so sorry to say America has shot your self in foot it’s all backfired Orange face Trump has no idea how economics world stage works . Trump sells this media networks to the American people their is trade war against us seems no nation is going to standby we all live on this plant we need to share each other’s business. China is world class Economy America needs to understand need to admire how china has grown it’s not a threat to America it’s facts America cannot except China is going tobe number one power house in economic growth need to take into account infrastructure,high tech,also they have abandoned of cheap labour. Sorry to say J D Vance on world stage represents America saying Chinese are  pheasant’s will at least they are proud to-be pheasants who are middle class and are  booming in china. America needs to wake up .
Rebadge the plane and sell to other airline and forfeit their advance win win for Boeing
China export to USA was 14.7% at year  2024. I think china can skip that 14.7% and sell to other countries.
This is only just the start.  China changed oil suppliers from the US to Canada. This is going to get whole lot worse for you Americans.
When does America get back that beef shipment, its time for America to get that carne asada on the grill.
It is so sad - for ChiComs.  Next country in line is happy AF!
The real victims in Washington State are the residents, the taxpayers!  If Washington has been so fluid with export trade year after year, so profitable, so strong Nationwide, then why and How did fruitcake Jay Inthlee tank the budget by 12 Billion bucks? Now, radical Democrats want to dig deeper into our pockets because Democrats cannot spend within their means! DEI-GO WOKE Go BROKE!  But they do have a 20 Million dollar- 75 Gender bathroom to accommodate 2 actual genders and people suffering from a form of MI
It's looking like China has got Trump by the short and curlies.  Oh , Trump is such a great businessman - ha ha ha
If Cantwell’s involved it’s bolixed up from the start.
madd maxx baby
Lesson #1 Never mess with China again Donald 😂
Yep, Trump is making America Great Again :)
Well done Trump 🤣🤣🤣
Good China won’t bow to anyone especially when these tariffs are outrageous, ridiculous, will cost consumers millions. China only relies on 15% of their GDP from US sales…so we the people will pay
Look at your stock market! its great again !
HOW DARE Trump pursue a level playing field regarding tariffs!  The audacity!
China is auctioning off her fleets of Boeing, that’s why they will not need parts also.  Happy now?
4500+ Chinese National students attending the UW. These students intern at every major company including Boeing. They will still get their access to innovation and technologies.
Long and behold...... Trump is just starting. I thought Fox was behind Trump on this nonsensical teriff move!
Everything is crumbling! The stock market was at 43K when Biden left, four months into this administration is down to 37K. It is only the beginning to a very painful reality for many people.
Welcome to Venezuelan States of America
😂 Just like little kid, cant talk like adults. Why would the world follow a childish country.  SHOWING WEAKNESS TO THE WORLD. 😊
Trump is a national disgrace,   and sadly, I voted for Trump. My dad worked for Boeing for 35 years. Remove Trump from office, full stop!
What a self-inflicted injury by a very dumb president!!!😢 Stupid!!!😢 Wake Up Americans!
Our "representatives" in Washington will probably try to replace that lost revenue with new and creative taxes on its citizenry and business'.
As soon as Judas "Vance" enters the Vatican, the Pope dies! 👎 Strange...  He killed the pope😢
Trump is old school,  too old, and too dumb to understand the benefits of the global economy.
"Return to Sender" may now be the growing global rejection of USA's failure-prone products! Ouch... And we heard Agent Orange was bragging how his "Liberation Day" tariffs were going to make foreigners buys billions more of made-in-USA goods. 😢 Sheesh, what a Snake oil salesman is that Donald!
Is he making us great yet? I'm not seeing it...
👏👏👏 tariffs!!
Are we great again yet?
Ah😢
Stop buying stuff made in China if you can find alternatives 🇺🇲
India will buy these Boeing planes ✈️
Trump making China better again
Fox is finally showing their true colors
God bless America! Our beloved President Trump and his administration! America FIRST!!
The Stock Markets  another Low today😢
Seeing that Boeing planes has been crashing a lot in the past few years. I'm glad China is not buying their death coffin planes.
Trump 😢is a Loser,😢  we all has to pay for his dum decisions but Magazin forks love him
Line number 7887.
Thanks tRump!
Boeing is not concerned
to bad for China they are out one plane. I am sure Boeing will be just fine selling it to another Country that now doesn't have to wait.
Can they bring some rare earth elements from China?
Will it be labled as a "demo"?
Fox is responsible for getting the orange rapist elected…Rupert Murdoch has some more damage to America than anyone…he is the kind of immigrant we don’t need in this country…down with Fox!
🍿
Only president in the world who can say stop stealing and distributing to the world,that why there is immigrants running from jobless economies
Don’t buy anything from china!
Many if not all of these corporations gave huge campaign donations and voted for this Trump Administration.  They were thinking they would get huge tax breaks tax loopholes and tax reductions.  Now they are complaining because I guess their big tax cuts won't be enough to help their company survive the Trump destruction
You can’t blame China , more than double its value that’s over 200 billion on orders , trumps winning
Carney is Evil...Carney is Evil...Carney is Evil...
America is economical toast. Dow down to 37970 , Prices and inflation going up, people getting fired and loosing their jobs by the thousands.  Now the banning of Boeing. What else is there to come. Afraid!!!
Sell it to India, problem solved
I call BS - In Canada alcohol sales is Provincially regulated not Federally.  Each provincial government pulled US alcohol from their shelves independent of each other and not under any direction from the Feds.  Few Canadians are complaining as its Buy Canadian Bye American from coast to coast to coast.  Elbows Up
So much for american exceptionalism
I wonder if anybody decided to check it for a bomb
1 jet. Kinda like the Garcia ms13 dude. Media is pumping it up like China is really going to beat the US in this tariff game😮
Make America Great Again 😂😂😂
At what cost
Boo hoo
Why is Washington buying lumber from Canada? That's like buying apples and salmon from Mexico.
Huawei was a victim of first trump administration.. This time china is playing 😂
Trump makes Boeing massive layoff again.
All Trump caused..make him go away problems will go away.  Impeach
i'm sure they will have the tax payer pickup the short fall.
Will Boeing stand strong? Will the United States endure the wrong that is being done to it? Will Maria cantwell or I should say Maria can't vote well ever shut her mouth? These are the questions of our age!
Trump has destroyed everything he has ever touched and yet his ignorant disciples blissfully wallow in his filth!
Boeing a victim of tariff war?  Really that's the problem?  Has nothing to do with FAA limiting production?
After getting sick and tired of the western propaganda against China I started living there during the winter months from 2009-2019. China blew my mind in every way possible. We are being lied to by leaders who have profited immensely off China and now want to flip the script . Do your homework!  And good luck hearing back from Boeing!  They are somewhere sucking down a $2,000 bottle of champagne!
#toldya
Let us be clear: Trump's senseless tariff war is the reason Boeing is losing business. Next come the job cuts.
