Doctors are God.thers is no God .the only God is in this world is a doctor.ya sometimes they behave rude but think from there point of view a 24×7 job .a patient . doctors are the best .
I could mostly hear the thoughts of my doc....and his team too.😂slight change now. But ...yeah. And most of them were happy with me because of this.

Something I observed at around 0:40-0:45. The character of the doctor is played by Eisha Chopra whose name is Akshata Sharma  in the vidoe which is an easter egg from The Dice Media's (Filter Copy's associate channel) famous web show What The Folks where her character's (Anita) sister name was Akshata played by Anula Navleker.
Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  make if bahu can hear thoughts

Please give us this content , not like new content
So interesting pls post more videos on doctor's or hearing thoughts ❤❤❤❤
As a doctor and an asthmatic coming from full asthma family. I really do stand by the Synchrobreathe inhalers by Cipla. I hate pharma shills and I'm way of advertisements but it really helped especially the older members of my family who don't have the lung power to use saadhaa inhalers or who have trouble pressing or holding the various parts.
OMG! Eisha is back! 🎉
OMG! Eisha is back!
OMG! Eisha is back!
Bring Saadhika❤️ as Doctor. I miss her very much🥰

Hehe
Logo change??? KYU
Hi
Repeatitivd format
And as an asthmatic myself yes asthma is manageable no need to take cold ice things start start mai todha mushkil hota hai but baad mai you get use to it 😄. Jitni bhi garmi ho i take liquids at room temperature i was diagnosed with asthma when i was in 1st standard pehele bahut galtiyaan kari taking ice and not caring about my allergens but then i started to take care of myself and now i am so much better it feels like i dont have asthma at all ppl who are non asthmatics tell them that what you felt in covid this is what we feel when we dont manage our asthma. I know it feels dry ALL THE TIME specially in april and that time all you want to do is chug a cooled drink or fridge ka thanda paani or ice water or gola. Also never had gola or ice candy in life (i was in class 1st remember experiences shuru karne se pehele khatam) anywas back to topic dryness in your lung will go at room temperature water and body will also get cooled at room temperature water. After a while you will not even miss it 😅 jab khud acha lagake toh cold things apne aap chodhu jaayengi bina kissi mushibat ke 😊.
Children say no to VAPES! lungs mai normal air loh bas 😊
Kindly add subtitles in your videos like you used to add....so that everyone can enjoy your videos😊
Thank you for making this video even i have asthma makes me feel relatable 😢
I'm always absent minded while visiting a doctor 😶‍🌫️😭
Missed elisha chopra 😊 please bring her more 😊😊
Gotcha on time,kuddos to team filter copy on being so consistent and talented. Loads of love😁
Dear asthmatics no matter how much inhaler you use you will not be able to some things like running, playing tennis and its okay. I am too asthmatic i do power walking on empty stomach for 1 hour 😁 first thing in the morning and i am already loosing weight 😊. Pollution bhi toh ab itna  badh gaya 😁😆. I respect Doctors and doctor only suggested me this.
Please make a video with Urvi Singh Anupriya caroli and Tanya sharma
Nice video Liked the Acting of Elisha Please make a part 2 of this video
