when Michael Jackson died she was like i got you then came out with another banger
She can dance. Too bad shes a loser in real-life
Wow❤❤
Her movements are so mesmerizing
You can't deny that this woman was meant to entertain. Idc what else you think about her.
I was jealous but something clicked and my heart is open to someone named Amala
Not really a follower of Doha Cat but the Memphis group styling and shout out to the 80's was epic, I saw Janet, Madonna, Prince, Cameo and much more. Well done Doja
Doja cat is a musical genius she can't make a song that I don't like💜
what the....
You know we have to post up right. Is you fully in the body. No. Then we wont be. Post up.
Right Molar right.
ate
There's fans in there then there's just other artists watching 🤨
IM SEEING A WHOLE LOTTA OF JANET
Doja is so unserious and relateable online that I forget she’s a multi-hyphenate performer. This era callback through choreo was so cool.
2:40 como se llama ese estilo de baile?
Ya catch that 80s Janet inspo ❤💯🫶🏾🙌🏾
Female Michael Jackson
ATE THIS
MOTHAAAAAAAAAAA
Whatever she does with her neck/shoulders at 2:25, I just can’t wrap my mind around it
*This is just low-key just so good🌹*

I love 80's and I love her
What just happened!!! Who knew she could dance better then her back ups, along with sing and rap 👏👏👏
Prince would approve.
Micheal Jackson rip off
Nobody is beating this girl and how she's not recognized as one of the greatest entertainers on Earth is insane.. I never knew she was this much!!!
Simply the best
it's nice not seeing any phone, just people hands
Doja did that. She's so beautiful and talented and amazing.
🤯 i literally have no words
Freemason set.
That lady playing the instrument behind her look like the lady in my video dirty Diana
SOOO GOOD to see Kenny G again! hes a legend!!!
She's dope rock
Maybe I’m a fool, but I didn’t know she could dance like that. That was incredible.
who else can give you Michael AND Janet AND Doja apart from her?
This is real performing. Fantastic!  Even eye-contact with the camera when dancing in front of the mirror. Next level.
Doja is so sickening. I freaking love to her just do anything with her talents ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is amazing and reminds me of old solo Gwen Stefani ❤❤❤❤
Along with the Kenny G cameo she should have brought out Morris day.
This is Michael Jackson coded and I LOVE IT😍
Who else had to think of Michael Jackson? 🤭
Max Headroom!!!
I don’t know if it’s the way she’s treated her fans or doing an 80s record five years too late but this album is barely clinging onto the billboard 200. Scarlett and Planet Her are higher.
artist
The choreo 2:23 ❤! The 8-Ball jacket — omgosh, the memories! The 80's was off the chain! ❤
i catch her lip singing at 1:53 , but i dont mind ✨💕
That's what I call a performance
Yoh make ny mood light❤❤❤
This Performent One of Doja Cat's performances made it impossible for me to take my eyes off the screen for even a second.
Wauw AMAZING performance...really!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks 👂🔥🤜🤛
Certain things god said dont do.
Cutting bro said because we on a different planet. I am less. No.

Kenny G has gotten me through many tough nights.  Props to Doja for introducing him to these youngins
She is THE sexiest GODDESS of Pop The face, The body, The legs, The feet 🥰

Rap Godness

She’s seriously underrated … her last album is amazing
Omg first of all kenny G! 2nd I love the vibe of the song  like an 80s beat so great 👍 👌
Anyone knew it was Kenny G on the clarinet.??
This is so fun! I love everything about this performance and the fun they are having!
This is how it should be done.
She's bringing 80s back.
Doja came out casually with one of the best MTV VMA performances ever 🥶
Kenny G in this B 😮
JESUS, DOJA 🔥💅🥵
Big thumbs up for this one.
Iconicaaa
I haven't really known about Doja much other than that massive song say so. I'm absolutely floored that was incredible! I had no idea she could dance like that, her presence was mesmerising, bravo Doja Cat.
Best music video i saw in 2025. Doja, your the ma'am.
0:32 eastenders
Paula Abdul copy...
that mic was off
0:38 se robó el protagonismo.
This was cool.
That synth bass is ridiculous, instant stank face
Doja has immaculate taste in picking her live band and Kenny G on top. Too top tier. 🙌🏾
DAMN.
sounds like kpop
real art
I knew I was going to LOVE this performance from the first second.
Who choreographed this. It’s a freakin masterpiece
Need her to do more 80s vibe music this is my favorite song of hers
Really well presented.
That’s some Illuminati Freemason bloat right there!
Haven't felt this type of excitement and energy since Britney Spears! 🎉🎉❤
Kenny G ✨️🙌💖🙏
Hear me out…………                                       Her and Tate McRae performance wise

What was the point of cutting to the boring people sitting down ?
although i hate her as a person, as a perfomer this is it. Dancing, singing, stage, everything. Not whatever tate mcrae is doing.
she's such an amazing performer!!
❤ Doja
This is disco from the 80’s!!!😮😮😮😮
Kenny G ❤🎉❤🎉, I need to see your show before you go😢😢❤🎉❤🎉❤

This sounds like dance movie soundtrack. Where is the singing or melody
Mejoro la voz 🗣️🗣️😍😍🎵🎶🎵 tiene una voz impresionante
Ella tienen un cuerpo MUI lindo 💓🫦💓👌
Okay but these background dancers said, "Oh you want me to dance? I'm about to earn this check baby!!!"
Example of born for the stage

FODA

I love seeing the 80s in 25! How does Kenny still look the same?
I LOVE YOU, DOJA! TOTAL PERFORMERR
I honestly feel out of breath like I feel physically taxed by watching this she is just so overwhelmingly talented and w such a casual attitude
eu amo issoooooo
I’ll definitely recommend this to others.
1:27 - 1:38 is just mesmerizing
The backup dancer stole the show , uk which one 🦹🏼
I didnt realize she could do all this. Too bad she likes Satan
She ate, licked the plate and then smashed it. Incredible!
Ok she came out to ,Kenny G!!!

I love this damn performance
If it’s doja it good
just love this vibee
Happy Birthday Doja 🤍🎀🩷
Happy Birthday Doja 🤍🎀🩷
Lord please bring back the 80s
I grew up in the 80s… I turned 47 this year…. She is a true student of the game. All the cultural troupes and iconography, the air guitar and Keytar… u most def captured the Flyte Time Paisely Park MN 1986 sound. I felt like I was 7 years old again because that’s how pop culture looked back then.   I’ve been following her career since “No Police”.   I was almost expecting Dick Clark or Don Cornelius to come out after the performance to get the name of the band members.  Very well done Amala
She's got strong hamstrings
mj's daughter
She's such a good performer, she's amazing.
Ate ❤
Nah not a whole Kenny G. I knew it !!!!  I Feel like a kid again
lol. I forgot how cute and little she is. Little sis. lol 🩵
Why is glo looking like that…
🔥 🔥 🔥
Unmatched. If she were a man, she’d be being called the new Michael Jackson.
SHE NAILED HER PERFORMANCE
exquisite ❤
I love this song
Such a vibe❤ such aura
At like 3:50 i recognize that dance move from something but i cant remember what

Mommy so gorgeous ❤❤

She's a great dancer ❤i love it

Doja такая талантливая: и поет, и танцует, и красивая, и умная. От танцев в этом клипе просто в восторге, не знала, что она ТАК умеет! Невероятная девушка 💔
the opening was giving Eminem rap god
I love you doja cat.
I effing love the 80'sssss and she is doing it justice! Like she is ALL INNNN! LOVE IT!
She's so talented! I really hope people recognize her greatness and creativity ❤
kenny g????
Mother
Doja Jackson ❤❤❤❤
I see a lot of MJ inspiration in her dancing, unbelievably good performance and those judges unimpressed faces at the end says it all, THEY ARE THE JEALOUS TYPE ❤
She has it all, her dancing, muscle control, body, pretty, like Janet Jackson, Madonna, Queen Latifa, all rolled together is Doja...❤ wow...my screen is melting now...
Song so good I had to do it for my school talent show...oh Doja..the woman u r💔💔💔
She's great! Is she pregnant? She looks about 3 to 4 months
MOTHER
THATS HOW ITS DONE
I LOVE HER SM 🥹💞

I’m sharing this with my friends.
Gag
It's crazy we started with Mooo! And ended up here -- I've been a fan since day one and it's insane to see her growth as an artist!
🤮🤦‍♂️💩
@Eminem

She’s such a performer!!!
So smoothly she got up from floor

This reminds of early Madonna and Janet ❤
Wow this was worse than I expected lol. I think I'll go back to another era of music.
so JANET JACKSON coded,  LOVED IT❤
The concept, inspiration, theme, & artistic aesthetic,I ain't sure but it's like MJ, Britney, City Pop, 80s to 90s combination I also heard Superstar by Jamelia. Love it!
This is so crazy
💜💜
Amazing!
So lucky to have this level of artistry in our generation ❤
Great job. Feeling the Janet vibes on this one. I remember when she first came on the scene. Could tell she was super talented. She has a lot of versatility and cares about the craft. I'm not into everything she does or sings about but the talent and chops are all there regardless. She's one of them ones that will be around for a long time.
Let’s bring it to 2 million!
Wack
oh gagged
🎧🤩💃🏾🎶👍🏾
Doja is one of the few artists where I actually return to listen to her live performances just to listen to. This one and her rock version of Say So are out of this world.
Her dancing skills are crazy good.
ICONICCCC!!!!! So many nods to the past…this is the kind of performance that we have needed for so long!!!!!! Perfection!!!
born to be a star <3
She got it down pact that is a great performer way to go Doja Cat❤🙌🏾
Lip syncing expert

MJ, Janet Jackson inspiration running all the way through this. Did not know Doja Cat can move like she did, v good.
LOVE the rap god reference at the beginning, a queen of memes truly
To the people sitting down at 4:15. Yes, this is real talent. This is an artist. This is what a performer is.

doja cat is infinitely cool. I use to listen to her song so high way back in 2017 or 18, she has grown so much.
Here at least, she has a Janet Jackson feel. I’m digging it!
80s vibe
INSANE !!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️🥹
I loved the Michael Jackson vibe 😊
3:49 is my favorite part, the dancing actually being synchronized on beat is awesome 🤩🔥🔥🔥 and props to the ones playing instruments at the same time🔥🔥 excellent work🤩🔥🔥🔥

I guess your voice has drugs.....
Literally a FLAWLESS Performance
Very nice
Bro her dancing always leaves me on the FLOOR
I have watched this sooo many times, she is so insanely good
this is a great performance
I wish this song hit as hard on the album as it does here. On the album it’s really watered down.
Doja Cat quiso hacer una buena presentación.... PERO LE SALIÓ ÉPICA!
She got THE kenny g. I HAVEN'T SEEN AWARD SHOWS PERFORMANCES LIKE THIS SINCE JANET M J BRITNEY SPEARS...
10 seconds in and she’s copied Maynard James Keenan… 😮
Song is awesome. Would be better if someone else sang it.
Opening with Max Headroom skit and thee Kenny G!! Wow! Iconic Janet Jackson, Toni Basil, Paula Abdul references throughout this performance.  Loved it all!!! ❤
Performance incrivel! Muito divertida!
I will be going to a Doja Cat concert ❤ I went to Usher, Chris Brown and now Miss Cat is NEXT! OOh and I'll be in Vegas for Bruno Mars😅 2025 for New Year!

the instrumental at the start was INSANE
Doja cat i love you
She is wearing the bikini over the shirt 😅
She is so cool, I can’t handle this 😩😩
4:14 that peek at the celebs looked so boring! Barely even a smile. What an AMAZING performance!! Absolutely LOVE this album and I wish I was there to see this! The choreo is captivatinggg
I’m so happy she made this album
There is no one like Doja Out!! She is so original and I love her
Back again go check out her snl performance ❤
Kenny G
Im in my mid 50s, this brings me back to the 80s music that I miss. I normally don't watch this stuff but she is amazing to watch i keep watching this😊
I dont know about you but those two final guitar players with ALL the 80's vibes, I wanna now the stylist and makeup! :D
Her dancing was fantastic like the song too
That was WICKED!
I hear pleasure principle vibes here and im here for it!
I got MJ vibes
Wait!!! I didn’t know she can dance 😂🔥🔥🔥
This is how pear girls dress 🍐 80s Doja is the moment
A mulher não cansa de entregar
I’m so OBSESSED with this electric piano player. The 80’s style fits her so well
80s were the best.  She gets it.  Incredible

i love this new 80s vibe its incredible
The haka inspired hand movements and facial expressions are so good 😙 did nobody else notice that? 🥝
Best song of 2025. It's like 1988 all over again 😍
Wow 🎉❤❤ 🐤🐣🐥🪿
Doja did it again! Great song! Great performance! Body is tea. She is an icon, she is the moment ❤
Good performance but why wasn't a live show???
Su guiño a Michel Jackson con pantalón ancho, zapatos negros y blusa blanca, además del ritmo ochentero y pasos retro, muero!
Mi ricorda un pó Janet Jackson negli anni '90...inizi anni 2000 😊
1:54 I think some part of the vocal was pre-recorded cause Doja forgot to lip sync the correct line here. Still, a super great performance as what Doja always brings us!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rap God intro patterns❤
2:16
oh look! One of them spawn of satan, is performing! Awesome!
incredible !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow ..she is soooo underrated.. such a amazing performance
I would like to hear her singing more. Her voice is so angelic…
I must have replayed this like 5x, it's a little of every artist in every move from each decade
That bassline at 3:51 is such a beautiful nod at Michael Jackson's Thriller! So so good!
ศิลปินDojaและนักเต้นแสดงถึงอารมณ์,สายตา,inner,ทักษะและไลน์การเคลื่อนไหวของร่างกายทำได้สุดไลน์,เต้นได้สุดๆเจ๋งๆระดับโลกสุดๆ,,,ส่วนศิลปินและนักเต้นเกาหลีส่วนใหญ่ก็ทำไม่ได้เลยตามหลังฝีมีอไม่เห็นฝุ่น,,,,ยกเว้น มีแค่-โบอะ่,เรน,แทยัง,ลิซ่า,แบมแบม,เต็นท์ เท่านั้นที่ทำได้ถึงทักษในมือระดับแบบสากล
I first took notice of Doja Cat years ago when she was runner up in a B.E.T. rap competition. She was the hardest rapper in the competition. So authentic and so real. She was able to paint a picture with words. Even tho she didn’t win she ended up surpassing the guy that did won and she has now become a global icon. 🤩
Shes the last one keeping real pop alive. I fear when she starts to wind down that era will be gone for good.
idk why but it gave janet vibes
The guitarist and key-tarist are THE servers of the year and I will broker no argument The style team deserves a Grammy for the fits alone.
this was so frickin gooooddddt
This girl is phenomenal wwwhhhheeeewwwwwww🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
my QUEEN
DUMB Doja as usual ha ha ha blah

Worshipable body. Graceful, Doja!! 🎉❤
Glo is cute
Why is no one talking about her intro being the same as Eminem’s music video “Rap God”.
her dancing oh my god!!! her moves are insane!!
apparently she has that talent on the stage
She's easily the best dancer in the game rn
Damn! This woman is greater than Janet, Madonna AND Lady Gaga!! Beyonce can sing better, but this woman has more to offer as an artist, songwriter and performer!! This woman is phenomenal. I can't believe my eyes!!
2:06 Cyndi Luper reference
❤❤
Checker board floor? Hmm
My GOD this woman raises the bar for herself and others everytime!! Always bringing something new to the table!!! I’m so glad I was alive for the Doja era!
hahaha those background dancers are everything!! They the ones bringin that 80,90's!!
HOLY MOTHER FUCKING SHIT! Are you kidding me?? I FALL IN LOVE WITH HER MORE AND MORE AND MORE!! Watching her evolution into a str8 up superstar since MOO! has been such a beautiful thing to witness. Insanely talented woman from rapping, to making her beats, how talented she is as a dancer, to her creative vision, my god she is the full package and a true force to be reckoned with. I wish my libra sister nothing but the fucking best ♡♡♡♡
Just one word : fantastic
This women can dance
She’s cute but them racial group chats I’ll never forget she had toes out for the klan ❤

Ok Kenny G still got it!!
When she said she was inspired by M.J and others I truly see that, she’s a work of art for real
Those jazz fingers are fabulous 👌 👏 👍
Woman, you are georgeous...❤❤ ... and a genius ... a throwback to the 80's.in so many ways... I Love your new  Album. ❤❤❤❤❤ See you soon 2026 in europe. 🎊😍
wow.
She killed it
THIS TOUR IS ABOUT TO GO HARRRRD!!!!
I hate those TV broadcasts that show the audience instead of the artist's performance.
2:41 fireeee
Love her so much
1:13
beyoncé who?
A great homage to Micheal & Janet Jackson
That’s was a fire performance! Old school sound, baggy jeans and pop locking! She was fire!🔥
I have to admit she killed that dance. I'm talking to Janet Jackson
Why does she have a bandana wrapped around her ankle? It’s so random for it to be there its as if she was trying to hide a ankle monitor 😅
Really ?
i kinda think shes lip synching a pre recorded live perforrmance of this song, but doesnt matter cause the vocals for this would take away from her dance moves she was doing here. still good and i might be talking shit but thats just my opinion, not slating just putting out an opinion/observation lol
shes really embracing the 80s type music rn, 80s groove, and gorgeous has the 80s makeup cover shoot vibe, love it shes so versatile. true talent xx
Greatest Artists of our Generation.... if u don't agree     Fvck me ♡
She's showing us what's she's been learning with vocal coach with harmonising  Ouaaahahh. Proud of her!
Esta estética ochentosa le queda tan bien a Doja 🙏🏻
Worddddddd 🎉🎉🎉
3:51 THRILLERRRR THRILLER NIGHTTTT
Janet Jackson influence from the start to the finish, very similar to Black cat song and Doesn’t matter.  It’s good.
❤
The reference to the creepy tv scandal about the mysterious hacker in the intro isss soooooo smart !!!!!
Nah I don’t care what yall say about Doja cat that girl is a great entertainer …  I’m not even a fan but girl is dope …
Thanks for including Kenny G, Doja❤Truly iconic 🙏🏻🙏🏻💖💖
Dang she got moves🔥
Wow😮

Doja ate ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yessss
Yooooo I DIDNT KNOW SHE CAN DANCE LIKE THAT !!!!! 😮🔥🔥🔥🔥
O início referenciando a Sweet dreams aaaaaaa
❤ 80s
The fake instruments are pretty shitty
I see so much of Janet and Madonna in Doja❤❤❤❤❤
WTF!!!! Is playing that bass 😩
Im so happy she actually sung the high note. My favorite part and she kills it❤
Mad gal!
Why am I thinking Micheal’s beat was sampled?
The opening to this is giving me eerie indiana .... anyone know what I'm talking about?  😂
Fantastic performance
충격 춤신 랩갓 아기 여왕 실존
Can't deny Doja Cat  been in her bag since day one, but that *HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM* boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
I love this woman!!!  Can you imagine her collabbing with Janet?❤
This def gave me Janet Jackson Control vibes. Bravo DojaCat bravo!!!
素晴らしい👍
Woah her stage presence is diabolical crazy and mad fucking good! Doja Cat BREAK DANCING this hefa mad talented 👏 ❤❤❤ I love the 80's and I missed the 80's great music, dope videos,  crazy clothing and wild hairstyles.
It's like Nicki minaj and Lady gaga had a baby and that baby was Doja cat!!!!!!!  But Doja is one in a trillion ❤
表演超棒
Timeless 👀

3:49 why is this move so amazing to watch 🔥🔥
Album of the year.
Everybody going wild
@3:46 You’re welcome 💖💖💖
The complete embodiment of a 1980's  performance... the arrangement, beat, dance, props, lighting, costumes was outstanding.
Divonicaaaa
what a woman ❤
The dance, the song ,the visuals
The dance break though
Oops 🫢 she dit it again
Boy, let me know if this is careless, I Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide Which one is leading me to Hell or paradise Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I'm the jealous type I'm the jealous type  He loves me But he can't hold this above me When my eyes are green, I'm ugly You're vain and hip to rushing  I'm so overtired I will not wait in this line Never seen you cry You're mine  Boy, let me know if this is careless, I Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide Which one is leading me to Hell or paradise Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I'm the jealous type I'm the jealous type  Oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm jealous Oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm the jealous type Oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm jealous Said, oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm the jealous type  Said, you wanna do what now with who? I don't need a pin drop or text tonight I ain't even coming out with you You don't wanna show me off to your ex or your friends tonight Nigga, you must be on Molly 'cause y'all ain't kick it when we started up And if she really was a friend like you said she was I would've been locked in, but I called your bluff  No girl enjoys trying to tough it out for a party boy Everyone wants you, and you love all the noise You want what you can't have, but I made a choice I'm not your toy  Boy, let me know if this is careless, I Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide Which one is leading me to Hell or paradise Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I'm the jealous type I'm the jealous type  Oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm jealous Oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm the jealous type Oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm jealous Said, oh, I'm jealous Baby, I'm the jealous type
She looks awful
Creo que la gente no entiende la calidad de "performance" que está chica entregó. Para una persona como yo que nací  en el 93' y crecí con muchos artistas en los 2000's y esperaba con ansias estos premios para verlos en Mtv y le peleaba a mi familia que no interrumpieran este tipo de premios me recordó mucho lo que en un momento en el pasado disfruté.  No la sigo, no sigo tampoco artistas de ahora pero esto, esto en particular me encantó y me recordó lo que fue mi pasado y lo extraño.   I miss everything. Mtv y los 10 + pedidos, Telehit, la revista Tú, y miles de cosas más. 😢
synth bass's killing it
So talented! Wow!
This made me go off!
Is there anyone else watching this performance over and over? I am shook by these dance moves she has!
Oh yuh, Doja channeling Janet Jackson in dat mfcka!
Love!!!
How tf did Doja get Kenny G 😭😭😭 Yo this was dope
Impressive and Impressive 🔥 🐉
I'M SO IN LOVE
The stage reminds me of a Barbie doll set I had in the 80s.😂
She’s such an amazing performer! Bringing back Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson vibes!
Ich verstehe nichts.
My first time watching her perform. Very impressed.
The choreography and doja cat is so new energy it's a new wave
so talented😮😮❤❤
isaiah coach february 28,1996 macon bibb county georgia earth
Britney spears
Her dance moves & 80s vibe! 🔥❤️
By far my fav performance from the vmas this year Her stage presence is insane😍
People forget she used to be in a breakdancing crew
Iconic! ❤💙💚
Mic sucked she deserves better
This gives me MJ vibes.. so talented and hardworking. ❤
Her stage presence is amazing
I got so excited watching this! She's exhilarating.
She's Prince Nelson reincarnated!!!
yesssssssss 🎉🎉🎉 she killed  it
Is it just me or did time fly watching this?
2:20 okayyyyy okayyyyy I knew she could move but I didn’t know she could move like that 😮‍💨
And this is why doja is mother 😎 she can SING, she can RAP, she can DANCE, PRODUCE, SHE IS MOTHER! Dont try and prove me wrong because we all know you cant! 💖
Knocked it out. For a sec it seemed like she was gonna launch into a Janet Jackson mashup. That Jam/Lewis bass line she had going on.
Il y avait Prince, désormais nous avons Princesse.  Please don't Zapp, gimme an SOS band...
I HAVE A CRUSJH ON YOU DOJA I LOVE YOU IK YOU DONT FW ME ANDWE//LL NEVER MEET BUT YOU'RE MY BAE IN ANOTHER DIMENSION ON GANGALANG
THE MOON WALK BREHH HH REH RHEARH If MJ could see this it would have kindled joy
I've sat here and watched this like 10 times and I JUST JSUTJSTUSJTSU TJSTU STUSJ the pain I feel from not being able to listen to it 1000320402350530 times at once bro
Doja 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now I want a duet with Lady Gaga, they're both icons
1:56 lmao the lipsync fail ☠️
the intro was dope!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
is there something she cant do?
Channeling Janet Jackson.
Come ON FEMALE MICHEAL JACKSON 🌹🌹🗣️🌹👏🏿🤣
This was giving Janet Jackson vibes
I love the beginning paying homage to Eminem.... Rap God was a classic and undefeated..... for those of u who didn't get the opening
That dance break though!!!! She did that!!!!!!
THIS is what the VMAs are about! Miss this level of entertainment
She sold her soul to the powers that be and it’s crazy to think people are so blinded by the shiny lights
🫰🏽💥...
I don’t think many will understand what she just did in this performance! I just witnessed GREATNESS and this is my favorite performance of the year. Bravo 👏🏾 ❤
Oh doja! You are insanely talented I didn't know this..... I never was interested in her but after this .... I'm completely mind blown 🔥💋♥️😘
not a fan of Doja but damn that was fantastic
Where’s the Perfume & Brand… Gorgeous by D-Cat….
sounds like the songs i make on AI suno lol
Jewish type;
SOOOOOOOO!!! FUCKIN GOOD!!!!! Face tight, chills EVERYWHERE! She fuckin ATE with this performance!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
I love her
Legendary Kenneth Bruce Gorelick!
Now this is real talent I love it
Putain,  je kiffe cette fille. Elle est tellement polyvalente❤🎉 du MJ à volonté
Menudo monstruo en el escenario es esta tipa. Está infravaloradísima Doja.
Stunning entrance oh my
3:13 these back up preformers are HYPNOTIC.
Yes bring back my era, 80’s best era as a pre teen and teen
She’s lip syncing. It takes special skill to dance and sing at the same time. Not everyone can do it.I do appreciate the fact that she has an instrument in the song.
That's Doja for you all
She gives me Janet Jackson vibes
the dance moment reminds me of michael jackson performances so bad!
OUTSTANDING VOICE CONTROL, HONEY.
THE DANCE BREAK!! THE BODY CONTROL!! THE VOCALS!! THE STAGE PRESENCE!! DOJA YOU ARE AMAZING!!! ❤❤
Kenny hasn't aged! and Doja is LIT!
도자 캣 ❤ 모든 게 좋다
Her Style of Music The Way She Sings , She Raps is So Amazing . 🎤🎶🎹🎼
Oh ... Your dance so well ❤
Kenny G!!! He looks the same as he did on his first album cover.
Exclusively gorgeous international RnB and Hip Hop music video
A phenomenal performance. My mom and the 80's babies loves the Kenny G feature! Love & respect
Lipsync?
damn im mad I didnt get to watch till now, EASILY BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE VMAS 2025!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 KILL IT DOJA!!! SINCE THE BEGINNING!!
doja you're perfection. so beautiful.
i’m still recoverying from thiissss
JANET JACKSON is making a revival
I know Kenny G doesn’t still look that damn young.
❤
She reminds me of MYA back in early 2000’s
is she just lip syncing?
Doja Cat is easily the best all around artist of her generation.
this is perfomance is on repeat for 2 weeks nowwww so gooooood
pure talent at it’s finest 🔥
Very 80s
KILLED!!!
What was that?!
She can sell any song lol
🔥🔥💚
2:17 I think it's a mistake to kick that piece of stick, totally careless.
hot, dance good. but nothing special. at all to blow up.
Haven’t seen Kenny G. Inna long X. It’s good seeing him 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
This is how I look in my room at 3 AM
So creative and unique!
queen
Super Bowl!!!
For the young people, this particular genre of 80s music was known as “sophisti-pop”.. try Sade-never as good as the first time, Spandau Ballet- only when you leave.  Jenevieve is another younger singer reviving the genre, with Rendezvous..
She is one of the best artist of the century, wow
Sounds like Janet Jackson and moves like Michael J.
Amazing
Me recordó al ritmo de Prince, fabulosa Doja!!
Her casually being the next MJ-tier pop star after Beyoncé
She’s giving 80s classics modern vibes
alot of Bots in the Comments . this was mediocre at best . even lipsyncing was off . she copied the entire 80s like its something new . hoping she does more than this .
🗑️
Damn log hard now
80's en force
This is MY QUEEN ya'll ❤❤
I hear a splash of Rythm Nation 😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥✨
That Doja Cat is a very talented young lady.
I don’t think anyone understands how genius the Max Headroom reference is. Max Headroom was a show that initially aired in the early days of MTV. Some guy in the 80s dressed up like him, and hacked into a television station broadcast and started being really odd. It’s a mystery that’s unsolved to this day. This was called The Max Headroom Incident, and whoever did it was an OG troll. Doja is performing on MTV referencing the hijack. It’s so multilayered.
If Michael Jackson hadn't died, I believe she and Michael Jackson would have worked together.  Just seeing the dance moves makes me miss you.  MJ
Yo, I had no idea she had this level of performance in her. This was 🔥
Bring back the 80s 😍
Love Doja ❤ this actually made me cry for happiness for her …Doja is just the best… freaking awesome….best wishes beautiful talented wonderful amazing playful Doja ….crying now…
This gave *EVERYTHANG*
She killed it and I’m not even the biggest fan of her but this was the best performance at the VMA I seen in a long time
This was EVERYTHING!!!!
shes the best performer ever seen
Absolutely stunning 🎶👏👏😍🤩 Thank you Doja 💖💐
the 80s are coming back yall!!!! I'm an 80s baby, this makes me so happy!!!
She ate
She has this I Dream of Genie shape / liquid snake kind of body movement. It's so mesmerizing
She's a proof of perfection 👌 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💯
la mejor bailarina mujer. reina de las performances
A zulu girl with some power!.
Love every bit of it.
Omg!!!
When even the woman are turned on! Doja has it!

진짜 졸라좋다
This channel is criminally underrated.
This song with Michael Jackson would be definitly FANTASTIC
Haven’t you heard!? The 80s/90s never left!
Her talent is literally insane. Like idc she’s like a Michael Jackson girl genius and no one sees it yet
Man Doja has her Fathers Legs 🦵, she moves like her Father
This girl can Perform ❤❤❤
Doja cat must collab with Abel Tesfaye. They will create a 80s inspired masterpiece
Album coming in 11 minutes
Dude the energy she exudes, and the effort she puts into this. She’s so talented and a fantastic performer. Plus the move at 3:21 the hip roll then thrust followed by the little spin out. She’s hot AF I’m not sorry lmao 🥵🔥
you need to repent lady! stop livin for the Devil…. Pick up the cross& Follow HIM👆🏼
Hints of Prince in there ❤ Doja is definitely a Talent ❤
Wow she killed that! And Kenny g yesss

This song and performance is a clear nod to Ms. Janet.
Now THIS is the VMA’s!!!!!! The VMA’s that I remember, when BRITNEY use to bring it EVERY TIME!!!! Yes Doja YESSSSSSS! ✨🫶🏽✨
omg... I LOVED this live hahahaha. love the old new doja is back looool
she is SUCH a good perfromer. Truly the standard--she was made for this.
Holy crap. I'm not an 80s gal, of the genre any way. But that was. Amazing.
perfection
Ela arrasa msm
Doja is such a great performer, it's crazy. Hard to not love her talent 😊
Eitaa que ela  vem com tudo nessa nova era. 😮❤
"Yessss❤"
She's so elegant with it 😍🫠
this is really entertainment at its highest level. great work Doja * slow clap *
AMAZING performance!!!! I love it all so much!! I'm super inspired by all the art & charm!! 😍
Fabulous is an understatement...
I miss the 80s so much. I was in high school and it was so crazy.
Kenny G!!!
Hahaha
Gotta say, Doja is def a concept Queen. Reminds me of 2005 to 2018 era of kpop back when groups had different concepts for each new album
IM GAGGEDDD
diva
She is the most talented ARTIST out there now! She's everything, does EVERYTHING!!! my my
3:21 Michael all day
that is a FORCE
Janet-Jackson-meets-Paula-Abdul-looking-like-Kylie-Minogue
She is INCREDIBLEEEEEEEE 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
can't get my eyes off her, so amazing...
Mála çopia 3 J LO
The beginning is very Grace Jones inspired.And the moves are very Janet/Michael Jackson inspired.❤
Is she back to normal?
Am I the only one who thinks Doja Cat's style on this show reminds me of JoJo's bizarre adventure? She’s absolutely stunning!
My doja🩷🥹
She knows how to perform.
Kenny G still the man with the sax. 🎷
You did that Doja!! Great to have Kenny G part of your performance 😁😁❣️❣️
Okay two things she needs to release remix feat kenny g and I need to know what top she was wearing😭
la huea wena ctm
Amazing she is beyond anything performer out there right now
My jaw is on the floor
that's how it's done
Wow Doja congratulations on a flawless performance yet again🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Not everyone lying that this was a good performance? It felt so out of place. I love Doja but this was odd - Kenny G playing the intro and disappearing, and the song falling nowhere close to the vibe of the sax, followed by her dance also being off the songs vibe. The only part I enjoyed was when she started rapping. But everything looks forcefully tied together.
She id killing it but I cant stop thinking of jojo stand poses😂😂
Killed it! And the Poppin, yo true Artist!
She killlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllled it! Super bad band behind her.... Get the funk out my face Doja🤗... Super talented❤
This is so Janet Jackson coded, I'm obsessed
Talk about Performance. On point!
She is a FANTASTIC dancer!! ❤
I love the beat❤
THE MOVES?! okayyyy
Omg... I never see her dance Just wow
Stray eighties
oh my god the intro being a reference to that one time that broadcast was highjacked by Max Headroom, i fear i love this
Gorgeous 🥰🥰
Troy the warrior was here
So why do you love DOJA CAT?? Me: *Shows them this video* 😂
everytime❤
she dances like MJ king of pop, i love it!! <3
❤❤❤
さすがダンサー 魅せる力が半端ない
This dance mesmerize me !!
😂 doja are so damn bad LOL love her!!!❤
Dear Doja. Its Jewish new year today and I want to wish God will bless you with light wisdom and health this year. You been playing with the dark recently to the point it's hard for me to listen to your music. I used to love it, but if you go in the dark and stay there too long it will make you lonely cold and miserable, and I will never wish that on you. God bless you!
no notes. wtf.
Damn ! Her dance move gives me goosebump😮❤ Damn ! She has improved a lot in dance, diehard fan of Doja❤
Meow she can dance ❤
Anyone see the Price beats ? I see Prince influences there  And Paula Abdul too. The rythme and the dance. Live "Opposite Attract"
mom
This song is FIRE ❤‍🔥
Seeing Doja cat and Conan gray in the same video healed me
My baby has blown tf up
no backing dancers, damn
The wind was a paid actor at 3:08 LITERALLY
Hi
DOJA CAT A DIVA THAT YOU AREEE
I have been saying this over and over again: DOJA CAT IS THE LADY GAGA OF THE HIP-HOP INDUSTRY, and I mean this in the best way, not her being a copycat of Gaga or something. DOJA matches Gaga's versatility and commitment to artistry. Doja can sing, Doja can write, Doja can produce, and ofc, DOJA CAN DANCE. Her multifaceted talent is often dismissed and understated.
Total garbage. What a joke.
This is suuuuuuuch a sick performance Shes a weapon
Yesss ive have been a fan of Doja Cat every since she hit the scene!!! I knew she would kill it !! Big up's 🎉
Literally the performer of our generation
❤❤❤❤
Kids are so gullible these days. This girl can't sing, dance or anything else of worth. She comes out with a bra posing all sexy and everyone goes nuts. Today's artist are worthless!
I like your song moo
So effortlessly cool 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Inspiration from Paula Abdul, Janet and Michael, Max Headroom and just a 80s vibe
I love Doja Cat so much.
actress dojaaaaaa
huhu i loveeee herr so muchh❤❤❤
❤❤🎉🎉 Keep being the amazing & talented entertainer that you were born to be!
my jaw drop omgg
Ngl song is ass, but doja maxed out her dance skills for this
Kenny G though!!!!
This could easily be a Sabrina Carpenter song
Max headroom
Pleasure principle Janet J realness okkkkuuuuuurrrrr 😊
❤
This was better than Netflix today.
Damn her dancing is insane for thissss I love it! She's always got the moves on stage but that pop n lock was sick
Fucking nailed this I watched it on my phone and tv just bc it gave what award shows USED to give us 😭😭😭
Doja Cat should perform at the next superbowl. She’s ready 😮‍💨
She is this generation’s Madonna and Janet Jackson combined. And sprinkle in some MJ and Chris Brown.
I love the 80s theme. She is 🔥 all the time
Loved it. Shows that you don’t have to be in a thong to give a great show. This is what talent looks like.
nasceu pra isso, te amo doja 😍
BEST PERFORMANCE of the night. Doja ate and left no crumbs
Wow she's talented
i loveeeeeee itttttt
Doja Cat is the greatest female rapper of this generation ❤
Back to 2013 POPPING Dodja !!!!!! wee need to see you again in the battleeeeee plzzzzzz
I really hate how the internet hollowed music out to the point ppl can't recognize how exceptional this performance was. MTV wont let it simmer like they used to. Just onto the next now!
Standing ovation her team is on it❤❤❤
Shes back to the sythetic wiggy looking wigs of her early career. And I knew she couldn't live without eyebrows lol
Omg... where tf did they dig Kenny G up... I swear im back in 1995..
i love kenny g
She's incredible!!! Best dancer making music
I can’t wait for Vie to come out. Doja is bringing the 80’s vibes back🔥
Doja is an AMAZING DANCER,however,  the overall performance was lack'n
1:59 hey that’s me in the blue on the right 😂!
2:51 I loveee the expressions of the background dancers
Folk be hating on Doja too hard. That’s how you know she’s amazing!
Janet Jackson vibes. But, Janet is the queen.
Cold
Kenny G!!! ❤😮
Giving me Paula Abdul❤
She is the first artist ive ever seen that so naturally re-creates herself through the prisms of different times and eras! So gifted and talented... we are witnessing greatness in real-time!!
mom
A sick women she loves the missing children
The the tune change on 3:12 😩 I keep replaying it
The beats to this song sound similar to a song in the movie The Fifth Element!
I am pregnant with all the illuminati witches my satanic sun pregnancies ❤️ I'm spiritually 9 months pregnant with all the illuminati witches my alien goddess reproductive system was a legion of demon gods. I'm excited your brother Mitchell is one of my pregnancies and he's so sweet ❤. I'm having beautiful babies with my husband Jay Winn 😍❤️
Long time I don't watch a performance like this on VMA....
I have never seen her perform how classy !!!❤
damn she gives me chills 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Super lame lol
I'm more in love with doja than I have ever been 😍
Amei a referência do headroom mais alguma palhaça catou a ref?Se sim curte!pq não é possível que só eu percebi,o visual o fundo,pra quem não sabe pesquisa hacker headroom
What a show 🤩
Max Headroom reference 😂👌
🔥🔥🔥🔥
She's unstoppable! I heard an 80's Paula Abdul-ish vibe 💯
Haven’t seen someone with a mic like this in yeaaaarrrsssss
So cool!
She definitely a hard worker the performance and the official music video is amazing 🎉
One part Prince, one part Expose, one part Time, with Kenny G, and all Doja Cat?!
sucks
Perfomance🙌🏾🔥
Most of her audience doesn’t know who Max Headroom is or Kenny G for that matter !
I loved the performance BUT could not hear her!!!! It would have been a 10/10 if she had a strong voice. These are the type of performances we loved in the 80s! Thank you, Doja for bringing this type of excellent stage performance and dancing back. Loved Madonna, Janet, Paula and Michael from the 80s.
Nice sax intro, beauty InsAllah 1Love D 😇
Omg nurdisina ❤🇹🇷🇹🇷
Fue la mejor presentación de esa noche, me recuerda mucho a los MTV del 2000 It look's like Old MTV Chanel, one of the BEST perfirmance of the night !
doja is the best performer
ame tanto la Scarlet Era, tanto, que me cuesta consumir esto
Gives Michael jackson vibes + early 2000s dance breaks and im sooooo here for it!
I like this Doja! That weird demonic stuff was not it.. this makes me feel good 🎉
Is there any dance style sh hasn't mastered? 😳 Consider me impressed
❤
GAG IT
❤❤
Mother cat 🎉
Mooother🎉
she looks like an upper moon rank
Wanna see Doja X Bruno Mars Collab 🫶
What in the 80s illuminati is this?.😂
The 80's was a special time period that is other-worldly. It's of no wonder why it's the most continuously represented decade of all decades across entertainment.
Wow!!! I knew that she can sing rap and dance from time to time but the dance break on this one is SUPER! Not easy to perform like this u need real talent and training for this. Love u Doja!
I can see the inspiration of Michael Jackson in this
Yall i tried this choreo and low-key ate
People always forget how talented she is.
Doja pulled a Jem and the Holograms 80's vibe! love her, so talented.
Excelente me gusta la canción
Very, Very Talented...Triple threat...😌🙏🧘...Peace
I'm so ready for this 80's inspired tour! Doja rocks! 💛
❤
Mother carried the VMA
One word, ART.
I can’t hear her mic to save my life. Sound engineers for movies and live performances are really shitting the bed these days. You can hear everything BUT the person that’s speaking or performing.
Been here since go to town! I loveeeee my doja!
Kenny G is what had me so impressed! So glad she brought him out for this! Very much an era and boy he looks the same!
Is doja bringing back dancing? I love it
I SAW GLORIA IN THE AUDIENCE ❣️❣️❣️
Tate is a great dancer but does she have this conviction? Idk
I'm so happy i forget that doja can really dance her ass off cuz everytime i see her again dancing i am totally fascinated
The way she was dancing was so snake-like very hypnotizing matches the energy of the song  😮❤
WOW
Fabulous performance by Doja cat,she has so much talent.
SHES A BAD MF REPECTFULLY!!!!
They don’t make em like this often! I think we found our next icon
New Retro Wave ❤❤
How quickly doja cat hairs change>one milasecond
Was that the girl from dhar Mann in the crowd
the hair isnt givin
Totally Early Janet Jackson vibe and melody
The choreo, the staging, the costumes, the House Party / Saved by the Bell vibes PHENOMENAL. NO NOTES 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌
Always forget that she was a professional dancer before her music career. Her dances never disappoint ❤😂
It’s giving 80s Janet 👀
Yes, Doja.🥰
Ok Kenny G, you still got it.
Your so awsome
❤❤❤❤❤❤lovely babe only i love you❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song, this performance, Doja is a Libra gal like me & it’s about to be Libra season baby. I’m the jealous type too… 80s vibe❤
te amo
Long live the 80s..❤😂
Love the 80 s sound love it
SHe ate this down ❤
She elevates her performance every time she hits the stage amazing 🤩 ❤❤❤
The stomp walk with a Thriller type beattt
Very early 2000s coded
No shit she got Kenny G on sax?!?!
❤❤
❤❤
VIE OUT IN A WEEK
mothered ❤
gagged beyond words
Oh, well, ok then! I am here for it!
Who knew the “B I’m a cow” girl had allll this talent. I love Doja so much ❤
It’s giving female Micheal jackson ❤❤❤❤❤
MJ is watching her dance and smiling <3
the blueberry pancake hat would have ruined it if not for cleavage
One thing I'll never understand is supporting and giving your money to someone who has made it clear that she don't give 2 shits about you 😂  She just wants your money 💰
Beautifully awesome, from Africa with love
period pooh
Decorations, dancing crew, Doja's voice, Kenny - everything is at high level.
Jump scare when they show all the “celebrities” in the audience looking absolutely dead inside lol
Outstanding 🎉❤
She was so fine before the bbl... another fake Hollywood loser
Sorry but she did amazingly!
Aunque ha sido funada en Latinoamérica, yo la amo. Es muy talentosa y sus canciones son todo. Tkm ojalá algún día vuelvas 😢😢
Wow!!!
❤
Wow just wow🎉
you being jealous is EXACTLY what lead you to prison. CANT WAIT 😊
YOU ATE BABY!!!!❤❤❤❤
she literally belongs in prison.
that shit made me emotional omg 😭
It’s giving Janet 😍
Alguém sabe o nome do guitarrista que aparece no final performando?
Perfection
this gal is talented yo!! i love whoever put this concept together.
Incredible all round artist, so multitalented and precise and present
Guys, does anyone know who the guitarist is that appears at the end of the performance?
Wtf!!!! doja really is a good dancer
This is why I will stan doja cat for my whole life. She really brought that 80s vibe, like she is Micheal Jackson atp.
So refreshing to see an artist that can do it all these days! She’s on another level..I saw Janet, Paula, & Michael all in this performance…and she brought out Kenny G😲Yassss Doja!!!!
This is giving Janet Jackson. Love it!
2:23 Everyone watched their careers end!
To be a fly on the wall when someone said we should have Kenny G on this
The way I cackled at every f****** reference in that performance! And I apologize I may have flipped off Doja when she started to do that head thing, you know what head thing. Get your f****** head out of the gutter, wait put it back. Its doja afterall
Bom demais seloko mano 😂
Doja gon eat up a performance every damn time!!!!!!!!
ã mo
I ❤ Doja did not disappoint her talent is amazing as a singer, dancer, and rapper. 🔥🔥🔥
She ate
you are a WINNER baby !
you're awesome
Wooooooo LAWD how she just gonna casually give one of the best VMA performances of all time? *knock knock* HELLOOOOOOOOOO? This will go down on my list of favorite VMA performances right here next to 2000 Britney VMA performance.
Wow!
This is my 5th time coming back here. The preformance was THAT good😭😭
Doja KILLED this
KENNY G MY GOATTTT
At 3.51 we can ear the intro of thriller 🥹 that's so good 😌
She did amazing !! ❤
I’ve never clicked “like” so fast.
this 80s theme song went hard...
Was it just me, or did she perform like Michael Jackson?
This make think of a opening for a anime
Lei è  LA DONNA,punto e basta.... una bellezza e sensualità unica....
had no idea Doja can dance like THAT 😮
Could this be the best upload yet?
That intro into her singing gave me chills! 🎉
I need this version on Spotify
Idk if this is right but I think her dance is a tribute to Michael Jackson
❤❤❤
Reminds me of Mette- Van Gogh waaay too much
The Michael Jackson accents in this performance are top tier 👌🏾🫶🏾
The ’80s were peak — melodic glam rock, dark melodic pop, high‑waist jeans... wish someone could press pause. Doja nailed the vibe with this revival — pure vibe, pure sass - straight up groove queen.
❤❤❤
Almost looks like one of those Elon robots
This has me emotional 🤧😭🩷
Modern day Janet Jackson 👏
Whaaat? I DID NOT KNOW she could move like this! Not to this level! Where have I been?
We want to see Doja and Chris Brown!!!!
"Momma slayed,cooked and ate that up!!😂😂
she's definitely putting dance as the main star of her new album especially after proving rap excellence in her previous release, so excited for her to keep showing her genius in every part of being a performer
I ponder if we saw the same thing. ❤
the black lady gaga
she fucking killed that shit
love her ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
The song really needs Kenny G on the original song please add him
Why no one mentioned Kenny G performed on this set on VMA commentary!!❤
we need troye sivan ft to this song pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee like my comment
He is someone I can say I wish I would've been able to meet The world is definitely lesser without him...RIP Brother
Thats dope. I m a 80s baby and she rep sooooo hard. She might out beat janet on this vma espeacilly madonna vouge performance.

Poor Kenny G.
I absolutely LOVED this performance! Miss Doja is something' else! 💖
John dojaacuurhun puuss

I NEED THIS ON APPLE MUSIC NOW
끼와 재능

I love that Doja is about her art and music! 👏🏾👏🏾

Increíbles muchachas!
Doja can do ANYTHING, LIKE ANYTHING REALLY and do it great! I love her!
The mic was failed!!!
NURDİİİİ NABIYON GIZZZ O HAREKETLER NE AYIP
The instrumentals are way better than the ones on the original song
ماكنت ادري انها محترفة فرقص!!!!
Your consistency is impressive.
a doja and jhope collab is everything I need! 🔥
So i stopped listening to doja like right after say so and when i saw this performance i was like ya shes lip syncing but NO then i heard her breathe now im hooked on doja again just like im hooked on to tate mcrae, Sabrina, Olivia and all the other pop girls ❤❤❤
Very uplifting.
Great performance ❤
Incrível 🤌
I will not ever fall out of love with song.
she got Kenny fucking G
the 2backup dancers at the end SLAYYYY!!!
This is just one big highlight😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
She looks so funny. She is so short
This is just everything, but can we PLEASE GIVE THAT GIRL IN THE YELLOW some love, cause she was working that walk and she hit that stomp walk EFFORTLESSLY. ✨
3:08 the hair blowing in the wind along with that note is so mesmerizing
She could’ve sung at least 😢
She just keeps leveling up. Sis is an even better dancer lol
U dont need mad fans...uve got real people❤
Dancer or singer? 🥱
SO GOOOD!!!
OMG dojaa!!!!!!
It's Britney Spears
Love herrrrrr performance frrrrr🔥🔥🔥💋
Doja cat parabéns pelo seu sucesso você um forte abraço pra você
I wanna see a collab of Doja and Bruno Mars. It's gonna be lit
Mannnn she threw tf downnnn made me feel like a lil kid again in the 70's! Oh wait I wasn't born yet lol
Wow. She never disappoint
Came for Doja, stayed for Kenny, came back for the dancing. 🤯
I have to say, this performance was ABSOLUTELY STELLAR. Immediately reminiscent of Janet, and Paula Abdul and technically LOCKED TF IN. Excellent job.
Peak artistry
her body control is CRAZY
Masonic puppet 🏁👁️
Doja could do Tate but Tate could never do doja
Doja Cat reviving Max Headroom in 2025 is not something I expected but I'm here for it.
Voiceovers with warmth outperform monotone delivery
DUDE.... this is fucking fire! This has some old school Janet Jackson vibe on steroids.... YES YES YES!!!
Ever time I saw this lady I feel soo cool
That was amazing... #DojaCat great performance.... Love the beat. Keep em cumming girly
5 DAYS AGO AM I EARLYE
Icon🎉
I think Prince would have liked Doja Cat. 😁
Influence from Brittany with the clothes, early Madonna sass and moves from Michael. Doja is just amazing
sorry but, are yo telling me she did not put more boobs? sorry but she did and im disapointed... no naturals :(
Whew she’s talented asf
😶‍🌫️❤Mjdojiiicatiii❤😶‍🌫️
Doja is a genius... idc idc idc❤
미쳤다 ㄷㄷ
The sad part about this is,99% of the ppl in the audience have no clue who Kenny G is… Secondly, if this was late 80s early 90s, the keytar and guitar would have been actual musicians that could dance, not dancers with props.
Love this.  It brings me back ❤❤❤doja❤❤❤😊
Aint nothing but BACKS om the whole damn stage …so much so that he had to change the damn lyrics….now the next gig…OAKLAND 😂😂😂😂😂
You can totally tell she's having a blast just vibing with everyone. Those moves were insane!
The music is redundant noise
She’s an amazing artists all around! Dancer singer rapper comedian ommgg🎉❤❤❤❤
Reminds me of Britney
We need a Doja and Bruno Colab🔥
Daaaaaaamn 😂❤❤❤
She reminds of Bruno Mars haha the way she dances, libra energy
Yall can never make me like her haha
Smashed it 🧨❤
FUCKING FIRE
Holy shit !!! Kenny looks exact same !!
Doja;s performance was steller I SAW PRINCE < Madonna , Janet  Lady Gaga and the n Just Doja she did that
MAN....JQ...smh. Biggg time fumble my guy
Damn doja nailed this performance I give her a 💯💯💯
Doja was born to be Talented fr fr
people can only dream of having this sort of stage presence
Doja shredded    Periodt❤
This choreography is so good
I feel so honored being from that era in music she is currently performing in!!!  Bring it back!!!! Doja!!!!
Very Janet jackson like and having Kenny. G IS AWESOME. SUCH AN 80S VIBE
💕💕Yo this the most insane awesome dance performances from Doja Cat so why people are hating on her 80's dance performances at VMA's she's not trying to be like nobody else just her own creative self K.💕💕
2:25 HO IS U AI?!
Whenever Doja is on the prowl i become happy!!!! She is one of the greatest!!!
Only Doja could bring Kenny fkn G back! 🎉🎉🎉
Like this comment if you’re old enough to get the Max Headroom reference 😂
Damn she should’ve been in You Got Served the way she was dancing lol .. 🔥
She is what tiktok "dancers" thought they look like
KENNY G??!
She Bad
Lembrei da Vektroid
Reminds me of Janet Jackson ❤
You got to love real talent when you see it
This performance truly opened my eyes to how impressive of an artist she is, I would kill for a studio(or live) version that I could stream or download cause imma be honest and I mean no disrespect but I think this live version blows the studio and video version, out of the water. I am in awe when I watch her performing and I really appreciate the Kenny G and Max Headroom bits. Truly an amazing live performance ❤😍🥰🔥
FREAKING HELL legendary Jazz lover SEXY Kenny G!!! *.*
Wait a minute she really got Kenny G 🤗
OMG MAX HEADROOM
Vocals, dance, rap, lyrics, production need I say more? Doja is really that girl
The legendary Kenny G!
Not Kenny G
Adding timestamps boosts replay value
icon
GAG IT DOJA!!!
Eminem already did that....
Piano guitarist is a boy or a girl?😅
Her stage presence is OUT OF THIS WORLD 💖
I wish you were for the girls #wlw
1:52 she's a performer, not a singer.
Half South African or full South African (Tyla), we have amazing talent! WOW WOW
媽咪我好愛妳
She got Chapel Roan and Nas X as background dancers?
Say what you want about her but she kills it everytime - a 10/10 performer
Kenny G-Spot in the houseeee!!!!!!!! ❤
Boring..
💯🔝🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this woman......her talent is undeniable!!!!
The song is not even original because it sounds very similar to Pleasure Principle. So you stole my song beat, dance moves from my Grammy performance and 3 of my music videos. And everybody acting like this girl is really doing something..stop the cap it's called stealing and copying 🤔🤷💯🤣
some people were born to be famousssssssssssssssssss
KENNY G never age??? Doja dance is da bomb
Fly 💸 shhhh
It's 2025 😅
1:27 im
Started cutting up @ 2:23 .  Choreography immaculate
Damn... This sucks
Finally I’ve always thought the 80s aesthetic would definitely fit Dojas vibe ❤🎉
Kenny doesn't age
Animal print leggings dancer ate down
I'm 19 but I can't explain how this performance made me feel. I love the 80's and especially 80's breakdance. Best performance of the night definitely.
Became a fan after this performance ❤
SICK
The mic they gave her is ass though
Unfortunately yes...
She’s come such a long way from the laptop in the bedroom ❤
one of the best performances in years
She is so freaking COOL!!!!!!
Ven a mexico por favor.
I smiled the whole way through.
Boy, let me know if this is careless, I (Let me know) Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide (Just can't decide) Which one is leading me to hell or paradise? (Oh) Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I’m the jealous type I’m the jealous type  [Post-Chorus] Oh, I'm jealous, baby, yeah, I’m jealous Oh, I'm jealous, baby, I'm the jealous type Oh, I'm jealous, baby, yeah, I’m jealous Oh, I'm jealous, baby, I'm the jealous type  [Verse 2] I said, "You wanna do what now with who?" I don't need a pin-drop or a text tonight I ain't even coming out with you You don't wanna show me off to your ex or your friends tonight Nigga, you must be on molly 'Cause y'all ain't kick it when we started up And if she really was a friend like you said she was I would've been locked in, but I called your bluff, ha No girl enjoys trying to tough it out for a party boy Everyone wants you and you love all the noise You want what you can't have, but I made a choice I'm not your toy (Boy, let me know)
Kenny G, Doja Cat, the music, all the dancing and the dancers especially the keyboard person, it was all perfect
FINALLY..... actual dance, music and talent was brough back to the VMA's.
You guys need to turn up her mic though cuz she's singing live
The celebrities sitting down was disappointing 😢 this performance was 🔥 and I would’ve been standing up hyping her up. Thank god the fans were there!
This is cringe, it's like someone googled what the 80s was like
This is one of the greatest VMAs performances ever! Her stage presence always surprises me
So glad to see you back Doja Cat! We want to see your talent!! Excellent performance!
A BEAST!!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
2:02 looks like soul train 🥹 we are the lasttttt generation that understand the nostalgia
Wunderschöne Frau,und dies Tanz Bewegung i Love IT❤️🤩
KENNNY GGGGG
Hands Down she is the most all around talented female  rapper out today name another female rapper who can touch her talent wise, I'll wait.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................thought so
Whatever Doja does I can do vastly better
doja 10/10 the audio mixing?? ATROCIOUS. mama deserved better :(
This felt like a fever dream in the best way possible.
So you mean to tell me we could've put Doja Cat in the Olympics & she would've beat RayGun?
I loooove this more than I thought I would! The Max Headroom intro is awesome!! 💜 And Kenny G??! He doesn't age, apparently 😆 And that guitarist..omg!!!
Doja is an icon. What more can I say? She is the total package.
She is such an incredible performer. I really admire her talent
If Michael Jackson was still alive this wouldve veen the collab of the millenium
i am READY for the album
🎉Thiz
Puro talento ❤
Amo
This was really good.   The Max Headroom reference was fun!
Viaada
We're. not. worthy.
Doja is kinda the female Chris Brown. She's a THREAT!!!!!
Kenny G!! How beautiful and sexy that intro was! It's on repeat! 🎷🎼💃
I was hoping for way more vocals than this, especially that brutal lip sync at 1:53.   :(
esta super
Pink Doja💗✅ not Dark Doja🖤
Old school vibe. New school babe. Sweet!
O M G this one of the best performances of the CENTURY!!!! Doja finally putting her true self forward!!    I really hope this breakout season for Doja doesn’t come with a sacrifice 😢 for some reason I can see Beyoncé being behind something “Aaliyah like” due to her being such a talent powerhouse😔
True artist. She is bringing the 80s back.
Thank you M. Headroom
Doja the Great   This woman is hands down the best performer and dancer out there now
PERFORMANCE COOL
😊
THE performer

Wow Kenny G !  😂❤
Why does the stage set look like a gaint Trapper Keeper?
🔥2025!!!!
Wow what a performance Doja has it all. That dancing 🔥🔥
There’s so much Michael and Janet Jackson influence in this song and choreo
Amazing Libra

What a way to take advantage of the stage! 🎉🎉🎉
I FEAR WE’RE GLOSSING OVER KENNY FUCKING G??? LIKE WHAT THE FUCK
Wie M.J. <3
Garbage
Doja cat and Bruno mars have to do a song together
I swear they edited the high note, it didn’t like that live
OMG!!! Sounds very 80's!! And like Paula Abdul sort of type, I loved It!!
Wow Redman better than 90% of all these new GenZ rappers 🤯this man turned back the clock 🕰️ on us to save hip hop
Pinocchio Know Youre  nose  Why You Want Talk with me ?  The sky Don't need make a disclame I  make money  Probaly  anxious we  Don't Care  About That  No regrets   this cigarette smock Youre nightmare The Score Hill Knew The Price  Take Youre Grâce  Cause when im alone  This is this only moment  Im feel in peace .

I love you so much So Beautiful and Crazy performance
Both times I saw her at the Echoplex for $15. Were the happiest days of my life. Broke bitch problems. Glad to see her moving on up.
Her dancing reminded me of step it up the water scene with moose
DOJA!!!!!!!
Wow i love this performance, so unique ❤ 🔥😻👌
She ATE
Feeling alot of Micheal Jackson vibes
busettt!!! nyanyi live cok
The girl can do everything ❤
12.13일이 기대된다 하ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ 콘서트 빨리ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
I don’t listen to top 40 and all that, but holy shit this is a great song.
What a performer ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🔥🔥
Doja channeling Janet Jackson and I'm HERE for it!!! Incredible performance!
Wow amazing
And Kenny G.  What the fk. ❤❤
Doja litterally gave the young people a time machine to the 80's which is kinda crazy because she wasn't born yet either. The Max Headroom character was spot on and the Keytar and break dancing, it was 100% authentic approximation.
This performance literally breaks my brain every time I watch it. Just jaw on the floor the whole time. Everything about it is perfection
Crying it's just so good
She is a icon she is a legend and man she is the moment 🔥
wowwww
This was so good!!!❤
80's beat and Kenny G's 90's nostalgic charms....
Doja comes in a form of liquid
I mean I like her and it's ok to be inspired but call her Doja Copy Cat because all she did was took pieces of Janet Jackson 's live performances and videos from the 80's. Hopefully she references Janet Jackson as her inspiration, but have some originality of your own. 🤔🤷💯🤣
Doja hit another level, the dancing and vocals both being astronomical and we just branded her a rapper
Bad ass
Dude, if Doja Cat brings back New Jack Swing, I will be front row at her next show in LA.
Doja e perfeita❤❤❤
1:00 was Doja doing the spirt fingers?❤🤪😆
A modern Paula Abdul
I LOVEEEE DOJA FOR THISSSSSS, MICHAEL AND JANET WAS ALL OVERRRRR THIS PERFORMANCE😩😩😩🤌🏾✨✨✨😍😍 the wayyyy i was SCREAMING😱😱
Yeah, Doja was born to be a performer!!!
Shes a performer great shows omg.
She's always been a great dancer. She sometimes gets outshined by fake talent...but she deserves all the spotlight. Shes a very diverse artist.
The vibe of the song is very 80s, and it impressed me, and it has some elements that remind me of Madonna and Michael Jackson. I don't know why, but her performance reminded me of them.
Was that rap god?
YES Dojaaaaaaa
Por qué nadie habla de esta presentación? Que iconica
Somethings wrong with that girl
It’s giving Janet Jackson vibes but I love it!
THE ATERY!!!!! YES DOJAAAAAAAA
I love this woman.....❤❤❤❤❤
3 days ago
I didn't know she could dance this good
love the 80's vibe, BTW when kenny G appears at the start, nobody gets who was haha
Sorry but her career is over. Last album flopped and its not lack of talent. She (and Lil Nas X) both came out as satanic and demonic. They were super proud of themselves and both made videos that were satan inspired- and just like that everyone ran in the opposite direction. They have invested so much money in her that they have forced her into the VMA like hey guys remember how much you like her. Well yes I remember but I'll never forget her true beliefs. She done.
she sings, she raps, she dances, she has the ultimate 80s artistry and vision down. doja cat is the best performer of our generation and a power woman that does it all
the kenny g feature. doja is such an epic performer who knows her 80s shit down to a t!!!!!!
she gave a tribute to Janet with this performance
MIC IS ON. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
She never disappoints with a performance, she is literally so mesmerizing
Great❤
you're really special 😆
I didnt know she could dance
I wanna know so bad who sings the trumpet 🎺😭
IMPRESIONANTE
tht was fkn amazing <33
🔥🔥🔥
Great article
What an incredible performer!!
Everybody jackin' Tory Lanez style ever since he started this trend!    😅  Good sh!t though, Doj.
Omg she is unique 😍
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 berbat bu mu sanatçı abartı ötesi
80-iger at its best, i see Prince moves

lipdub
Now imagine a Doja Cat x Bruno Mars collab 😋
Is it Friday night watching much more music? I feel like doja could revive it I'd watch it just for her
Love the song hope this isn't a ritual...look up Madonna dress u up live...virgin tour🤔
Doja so fye !!!!!
The dancing❗❣❗💥🤯🔥 Looks like MJ has decided to incarnate into Doja's body from time to time!🤩 Amazing!
This is so MJ coded! Absolutely love it

PATHETIC 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This performance is everything ❤
CHECK MATE OR WHAT, LOVE THE PINK! WHY AM I SCREAMING.... BECAUSE ITS DOJAAAAA CAAAAATT 🐮🦙🐇🐁
You know what would actually be a mind melting collab? Doja and Guerilla Toss, please and thank you!!
Makes me think of Prince in the 80's. Her & Bruno Mars should do an album or at least a couple of songs together.
She killed this performance. She had my heart in awe the entire time. 😍
how can this only have half a mil views when i've already replayed it a million times
I half expected prince to appear 🎉❤
I love how she's able to balance out her voice with her facials and actions. always impresses me
Oh, she's a performer! It's nice to see creativity, live singing, and dancing from an artist these days. Also, not enough people are talking about her homage to Max Headroom!
Tôi biết Doja cực kỳ tài năng nhưng điều này vẫn khiến tôi choáng ngợp
GAT DAMN!
Reminds me of Janet
We left the 80s behind for a reason. Why revisit it?? Just create something new. Geeze
And there she is eating and gagging bches  up ,Love U Doja
I’m getting Jackson vibes across this whole performance 👏🏼 doja you are a born performer
Woow,I must say some dance movies,don't even look human.Amazing
Great performance but the song is giving absolutely nothing
Paula Abdul vibes
Zantinoooooooo!!!!
WOW she was Beautiful
4:14 Paris Hilton and the rest of them were NOT impressed lmao
It must suck to play for peers that just look at you like they JEALOUS meanwhile fans love you.  😂.  Haters gonna hate
Her performance is incredible 🤯
I'm so proud of her omg
Max Headroom reference, Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul influences, Kenny G’s still breathless as ever, and Doja Cat’s singing and dancing talents all showcased in one instant classic performance. Wow.
its not that dojas other genres of music aint good but just that a lot people adore her disco pop
😊😮😊😮❤😊
3:34 best partttt
Vie is going to be the ERA! I literally cannot wait
👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Cmon doja !! That was amazing ♥️
Doja  is such an incredible female solo artist
Y’all can never make me hate her lmao
Yessss I love feeling of the 80s and 90s yess great performance
A reference to Grace Jones, Janet, Paula, many of the pop girlies and boys of the 80s. Its not just one. Its a reference and inspiration from many. She also did a reference to early hip hop via break dancing, which was apart of early hip hop, rap and dance. It started in the Bronx early 80s
we've come a long way since B*tch I'm a cow
The only jealous one is you, jealous of Sydney Sweeney 😂
Doja!!! 😍 this is insanely good. She keeps creating amazing art and this is amazing!
DOJA CAT - It's like Kylie Minogue and Prince made a baby
great performance
Amazing... JUST AMAZING❤
devoraste

This is so Janet coded! 😍
TEAMO REINOTA❤
Definitely made for this. She's dope

Yaay love this era

Doja Cat AND a Max Headroom reference? Obsessed
Nice Kylie Minogue vibe!!! Awesome doja you're something
prince meets jannet
We need a Doja cat and Ciara collab Asap ❤
What an icon
Hipnotizante
It reminds me of the 80s, it has something of Janet Jackson 🔥💃🏾
she's a really 360
This is called stage presence ✋
The nod to Max Headroom!
Stealing from white culture
I appreciate the ode to the 80s. Reminds me so much of 80s of Madonna and Janet. Great nod to Whitney in the very beginning.
Incredible ❤
Oh Im Jennes
the way she shocks me everytime i watch her she is just meant for the stage
❤❤❤❤

Love doja showing of her dance moves !!!! I Cant wait to see more of her!!
The 80’s with Kenny G and a Max Hederon like character
Ok Janet Jackson old moves 😊I see you beautiful 🤩
Reminds be a bit of Michael Jackson.
This deserves so much more credit! People are not recognizing the homage her artistry pays to the Legends!
I love her ability to reinventing things and making it new again. ❤
Crime to gorgeus 😭🧡💕🧡😭🧡🧡
2:20 It reminds me Bruno Mars 24k magic live

Personally this performance is better than the music video
Keytar! 🎶🔥
Top
Very good performance doja , i love the effort and 😊the time you put into this production . I predict you a good one .
Ohhh.... I love this. Kenny G was so big! It wasn't the 80s but I still had my first baby to his music! Lol
wow i didn't know she was this good
This is giving Janet Jackson
Oh my yes… 💙
I was about to be upset that they cut it before she started rapping!!
Wow, it's 🔥🔥🔥
Kenny G❤
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 girl you did that❤
WOW. my mouth was agape in the last few minutes. This performance is truly electrifying. I loved seeing all her girls SCREAMING in the front row!! And those backup dancers and musicians....like wow. Truly spectacular
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
My Libra sis
My queen my godess!
Oh doja you you know you ate this up☕️
WOWWW this is  what performing is about!!! More of this Doja Cat, my JAWWWW dropped!!!
The album is going to blow up
She is talented. : ) Her performances are always worth a watch.
We miss this mj era...
It's giving Janet Jackson and Kylie Minouge vibes
Adding context to trending clips distinguishes original uploads
The bra on the outside is soooooooooooooo 80s but I'm sure I've never seen that before
Loveeeee ❤
Perfecting her craft for sure.. 😮👏🏿🔥🔥🔥😻
Solid vocals while doing all of this dancing❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Fun. Genuine. That's Doja being Doja.
She looked best on Wildin' Out with meat
Impressive!
Doja is the Michael Jackson of our era ❤❤
This performance just screams out vie👏🏻👏🏻
THE BESSST IN SUCH A LONG TIME! LOVE IT 😭✨😻💖🐈‍⬛  Her outfit & makeup is everything!! 💖💖
People forget that her body control is UNMATCHED
its the Vans for me.
Tf 2:20
Those were some killer moves. Reminded me of Michale Jackson at the end of the performance.♥
She is the mother I never had
we will never ever see anyone like Doja. she doesnt even need to sing, her dance is just everything
that key bass tho 🎹
This is a good trac ❤❤❤
She found some gigantic "female" dancers. Those individuals were bigger than the male dancers.
I can feel 80' 90'
Very 80s and including Kenny G in the intro, Iconic.
No body got it like Doja👌🏽🔥
THAT FUCKING DANCE BREAK!!
🤢🤢🤢
2025 💜💖💓🎵💫
Ouuuu makes me think of Ms. Janet Jackson!! 🔥 🔥
DAMNNNN MAMA CAN REALLY FUCKING DANCE
this is one of her best
Absolutely loved this performance. Reminds me so much of Michael Jackson 💕
🔥
Doja ❤
She's still trying to be that girl I see
douma ???? cause man i cant unseee 😭😭
I didnt realize she was this good of a dancer 😅 clearly living under a rock cause her stuff will pop up on streaming every now and then. Guess i never saw her perform
I know they dont get the references
In all honesty Doja is so talented, so intelligent and so multifaceted. I feel unbelievably lucky to be alive at the same time as her, what a master.
I’m a jealous type ‘cause I wasn’t there to see this live!!!
You look stunning and dope performance and song took me back to the 80’s 💯💯💯💯
I love this
Doja cat she not whom you think she is ,She’s demonic she has the plan to deceive people from entering the Kingdom of Heaven. Run away from her she’s not who you think she is, run in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen
The Max Headroom - Kenny G - The Clothes - The Break dance - The Piano Guitar - The flat top - The big hair - 80's baby!!! She rocked!!
Loved it. Very 80s in the best ways musically. ❤🎉 thankyou Doja. 💓
hot damn o_o my muscles hurt watching this
They could never make me hate you doja cat
Kenny G was the man back in the day! DOJA girl YOU'RE TALENTED! ❤🎉😊
Doja Cat is so good at it; great performer! Enthralling performance; very impressive! 🤍🖤🔥✨
Wowwww I'm blown away. I didn't know Doja could dance her ass off!! She ATE and left NO CRUMBS!!!🎉🎉❤

Welcome back Kenny,  he looks great.  I like this vibe

So fucking stoked to see this side of Doja more.

What an Artist. The talent she has is phenomenal.  She gave us everything with this❤
00:05 Eminem Rap god vibes 💪🏻
OMG elle a repris tous les codes des années 80! De la clarinette aux beat, la chore. Toute ma jeunesse ❤
I wanted Kenny G to stay and dance a but with Doja! He looks so trim and great for his age! He’s 69, guys!
Masonic staging 👁️📐⬛️⬜️
oh my goddd
NOBODY IS FUCKIN WITH DOJA !!!!!
I love the performance. Love the Legendary Grace Jones replica and the Rock artist replica of the two band players on stage performance with her!🎉❤
If know doja used to pop lock back in the days so this is a ode to old doja
This has eurovision vibe
👍👍👍
Doja 🎉❤
whenever I look at any of Dojas live performances my eyes get all misty because I'm looking at excellence. She must be really proud of herself <3

CARALJO EU NEM SABIA WUE ELA DANCA, E DANCA PRA CAEALJOSNDJA SLK
I appreciated the performance cos I havent seen dancing like that since the 90s and I miss it! Just a shame the song itself isnt stronger.
Ela tinha que fazer uma música com Chris Brown e a ciara nessa pegada da dança.😯🔥
This beautiful woman is amazing.
Damn❤❤❤❤❤
NOONES ON THEIR PHONE FILMING, BEST THING EVER!
Michaela Jackson.    best female performer right now
janet jackson has entered her🙏🏻🙏🏻
THIS is dancing, this is skill. Not that bullshit dancing yall swear Tate McCrae is doing
The song, the 70's and her wig are not my thing but the dance and Doja herself were amazing 😍
What happened to MTV? Don't show music videos anymore they don't even have their own award show on it anymore?
dance god doja
Prince...Madonna..dress u up in my luv live

Demonic democrats including this demon look alike herself Charlie’s more important then these lame 304s
This is sooo cool
Zandile wethu!! 🎉
Damn! I didnt know Doja could dance. This performance is 10/10
This is a PERFORMANCE❤
Proof that you can do anything:
DOJA QUEEN YOU ARE
More of this, PLEASE!
Niceeee
Ελα μωρη ταλενταρα♥♥♥♥♥

Damn! It's like she just evolved from Charizard to Mega Charizard.
Her breast implants are very distracting.
Holy shit what a talent
Sorry Doja has ascend to a level no one can even come close to her , don’t even @ me
demonic hollywood is such a clown place man. The Floor is what many many other famous people have in their house or whatever the Black & White floor. Freemasons...
her live performances  are always just crazy beautiful
❤❤❤❤❤
I wish I knew who choreographed. This was incredible
Pierce Hawthorne's father?????
OMG KENNY G
Hands down the best performance of the night, the energy, the dance, the aesthetic, Doja gave us ALL!!!
OK I knew Doja was talented but I didn't know she was THIS talented
Goat 💥🙌👏
I didn’t really like jealous type on the first listen, but this performance is making me like it so much more.
The only good thing about this music is her bra line
어?!조혜련이 보이는듯😂❤❤ㅋㅋ

❤😮 amo você DOJA cat 🇧🇷 love you
❤
EXCITED AF FOR VIE ALBUM

OH IM JEALOUS.😭😭😭😭😭😭
This was a weak performance. One of my least favorite of the night. You are washed girl.

So beautiful queen love you Doja Cat
Dojaaaaaaa this my girllll yall ❤
I love this new energy she’s in right now. The performance WAS AMAZING! Keep thriving Doja!  You Sexy

Kenny and Doja ❤
😊
THOSE MOVES DOJA❤ THOSE MOVES!!!!!
Janet Jackson 2.0 ❤
Awesomeness DOJA!😊

90s inspired ❤ felt like I stepped into a time machine
What a woman😧🔥
She’s just a natural at reinventing herself everytime! absolute phenomenal 😍 Scarlet showcased her rap versatility and so excited for this new VIE ALBUM
They messed up her sound in her mike  cause  she was singing it but the sound was in and out, but she made it work. She's a quirky performer, I like her.

Omg she’s the coolest! This is art!
Okay Eminem rap God reference love it

My sister saw this live at home on the news my family and i were in our kitchen getting pizza and it scared her for life she said. also MY SISTER IS NINE!!!!
I’m still trying to recover from that performance
Every year she levels up but this?? this is NEXT LEVEL
Très bonne danceuse , bravo , c' est rare .

Max headroom

Remaking EMINEM😅 Intro is insane ❤🎉
Wow Kenny G
le niveau de bz
more degeneracy, what a surprise
i love you doja. one of the best performers of the 21st century, everything you've done is iconic and goes beyond what's superficial. you do pop excellently; bringing high quality art (whatever that means) to the masses. it's only u and gaga (from that prespective).
yeyyyyyyyyyyyy!!! hands down the best!
It’s like Janet Jackson possessed her body
Damn she remind me of Janet Jackson.

Thank god Sabrina and Doja were performing cause otherwise the vmas would have flopped
Mkultra freemasons song, you can even see it with the black & white floor 🥀🥀
Now this is a POP STAR ⭐❤
Great performer. Too bad the song is an 80s retread...and not in a good way
How does she do it? Bravo 👏
Doja came to SELL RECORDS!!!
Hope Doja Cat can collab with Bruno Mars! ❤
Sydney Sweeney would have done it better, honey.
I need to be at the next tour. Also this was Janet down
Dooooooojaaaaaaaaa! Sexy doll !
Holy sh*t that's Kenny G!!!!
The song has a 90s vibe to it.
HOLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY SHE CAN DANCEE AND SINGGGUHHH YOU NEVER DISAPPOINTED US DOJAAAAAA LOVE LIFE!!!
YES!!! Thank you for posting the better version 👏🏻
🥰🥰🥰🥰 catteu
Anyone knows the names of those 3 female background dancers?
I love how Doja's shoes don't include heels. it's just those samba shoes. I actually did not stream the music, i only discovered it just now. i love how she brought back the 00's type of beats. She never follow the trends, she does it in her own way
Kenny (O)G
when is the official video coming out or is it already out ?
glorilla was feeling real jealous xD , she cant sing, yung thug told her the truth, and while getting ate up by another female rapper (doja) telling her she jealous.
Seriously an amazing performance. I haven’t been this excited about a new album in a while
She killed those dance break!!
Great job!!!
Finally someone that can perform like Britney Spears
the best performer ever
This performance is just sooo crazy.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing 😻 a True entertainer ❤ She WERK that whole stage ❤
Standing Ovation 👏🏾

Shoutout to Kenny G on sax in the beginning.  I did not see that coming!  Lol
I can't wait for the new album miss cat
i became a doja cat fan after seeing this performance live.. that was such a powerhouse performance that reminds me of janet and left eye.. and she was the only one who really did have that real starpower on the vmas since britney.
This is such a big moment I dnt love dat wig but she’s growing on me so HELL YEAH
The BEST PERFORMER OF THE NIGHT
Boom 💥 👞
NGL This was better than the MTV one
Icon
A good friend of mine recently shamed my love of this as conflated to the Gaga performance from this same night. That was also good why'd you have to call it "brunch performance at the max" Idk what that even means
Yoooo!! This was hard af!! Doja hittin them moves!! 💯👏🔥
lip sync
Is... is that a max headroom reference
GURL YOU ATE THIS ..... GIVING ALL THE 80S ELEMENTS OF MADONNA JANET AND PRINCE..... FIERCE!

Kenny G !?? LOL
The rap god refrence!!!
Mami
She can sing, she can rap, she can dance, she can write, she can produce.. I mean this is really icon level talent
Incredible performance. The dancing, the singing, the stage set up, the song.. just amazing.
they uploaded this with only left side audio
Not sure why MTV’s YouTube channel cut off the entire intro and the beginning notes of Kenny G, but glad they’re here.
Tão nostalgico. Parece até uma apresentação da Raven Bexter ehehhehe meio disney, meio anos 80, meio 2000 nao sei explicar, sei que amei.
Based on the comments I'm feeling no one knows who Kenny G is. That was the highlight for me. Wish he had had more of a role in the rest of the song. ❤
Wow, I wish I could have been a part of this, been listening to you since So High.  My whole set design aesthetic is 80's and 90's, love it Doja, great job! 👏🏽💕
The stairs and checkerboard floor are freemasonic symbols. 👁️‍🗨️
자연산가슴 보기 좋았는데... 왜 수술했지???!!!!수술가슴 딱질색임
Is that Kenny G?
Love Doja so much 🩷
La ameeee ,fue increíble otra vez la rompiooo ,la amooooo, esque como bailo canto ,la pista todooo❤❤❤❤❤❤
Doja can pop and lock like crazy
2:48 the guy to the right of the screen.. am I crazy or is that not one of Sabrina’s main dancers that hasn’t danced with her recently….
She hit every single beat, her dance experience really shines w/ this. Excited for the album
Ok but the choreographyyyyyyy reminds me of how she danced back in the day 😮‍💨👏🏼
0:25 KENNY G!!!
Man, that was 80's fire. Loved it.
Been here since Moo🥴
I watched that jump walk twerk a million and one times😭😭absolutely DEVOURED!!!
https://youtu.be/16FLu8-rfAc?si=tz9-Eg0_44gGnrUl
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Perfect 👌
Ready for this new era
Masonic floor...😅
I love the nod to Janet Jackson’s mirror dance from Pleasure Principle.
Vibe of 80s and Michael - it's so cool!
MEU DEUS MARAVILHOSAS!!!!
She’s a great dancer but the song is a no for me sorry
Estou sem palavras até agora pra essa apresentação! 🇧🇷 ♥️ Grade Artista!
this backdrop in beggining needs to be thoughout the VIE's tour narrating as George Orwell's 1984 everything to create an atmosphere of her past work and the act of the concert switiching as TV programming and SHE STILL STANDING to the change of time
Yo Doja cat is amazing
🎶👑👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is very paula abdul 80s style
i knew ms doja could shake her derriere but daaaamn i had no idea she could bust them moves like that… she out there spinning, twirling, doing cartwheels, and what not and still sounds good like that at the same time 😮 that’s hella impressive!!!
Doja always tight with choreo
Best thing I seen since Micheal Jackson do shit like that holy shit doja cat is iconic!!! Plus she raps her ass off and produces she the GOAT
LITTERALL QUEEN (my fav part is the jump walk soo ICONIC)
This was insanely good
The first video clip shown was inspired by Eminem's Rap God?????
0:16 Is this a sign for jealous type Extended (mtv remix) version?? Whaaaaaaahh✨✨✨
Agnez Mo vibes 2:22 2:23 2:31
Why is nobody talking about her Max Headroom impersonation?? Literally iconic
Missed you, 2!
I was like fire the sound guy 😅
She didn't have to eat it up like that
This eats she’s such a talented dancer
I really f*ck with Doja Cat

Kenny G's last name is actually "God". He's just a very humble guy.
Great moves, pee butt.

The Eminem Rap God Reference in the Beginning??
Any other nerds like me notice they accidentally showed the video wall screen layout in the first few frames Edit: the audio on the vmas channel was done terribly i guess this show was full of technical error but still a great event none the less
DOJA IS READY FOR THE SUPERBOWL
I didn't know Doja could do this, wow! 👏🏻
I hate it when an artist is crushing it on stage and they pan to the audience and the other artists don’t look supportive talk about “jealous” 😂😂
Ela sempre entrega 🤌🏽🥵🔥 a melhor da noite!!
QUEEN
Beautiful doja
😻😻😻😻😻
I’m sorry but this song is not even all that it sounds so familiar and too similar to her other music. I need a new sound.
I see MJ and that’s a great thing😻
Masterpiece
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Doja, you are phenomenal! Sing, rap, dance, gorgeous! This to me was the best performance of the night. Queen Doja.
You always move my beautiful
Paying homage to the great Janet Jackson!
She killed the dancing sense 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I feel in the 80’ even I was born at the end of the decade those dancers and vibe on point she’s an amazing performer
😊💥🔥🔥👏💯☑️
Jennifer lopez should take good note on this performance.
She was Jem we wanted but we didn't get it.
Love it Doja bought the 80s back with perfection 😘😉🍎
Glorilla jealous

Всё ждал, когда она раздеваться начнёт...

Janet coded 🔥
Oh ye dancer
Ain't no one messing with doja she's a beast killing it in everything she does dance singing and flow effortlessly
واوو اول عربيه+ قبل ٣ ساعات
Stealing from the 80s artists and bringing nothing new.... 🥱
OMG THE PERFORMER SHE IS !!!! SHE'S TAKING THE GAME FOR FEMALE RAP
This felt like going back to the 80s. Janet, Paula, Michael, Prince, Lisa Lisa, Cameo and more of these great artists 🤗❤
Hair and clothes not the best choice in my opinion everything else was fab and the track is infectious
Doja’s performances are always so dope.
she tried to be like micheal jackson u will suffer the consenques
She killed it. Have been playing the song non-stop since the release. 👏👏👏
That's perfect love how you do it beautiful, and amazing voice ❤
THIS WAS/IS PHENOMENAL BB!!!  🔊🖤💯
Fantastic
SO EXCITED FOR VIE!! AAHH!!

Shouts out to Kenny G, and Doja's Max Headroom reference ♥️
She taking me back to my childhood ❤I love you Doja!
I’ve watched this an unhealthy amount of times
Her sharpest dance break EVERR! 🫶🏾👏🏽
Was good
Janet vibes
ARTIST! 🔥🔥🔥
That outfit was givin Demon Slayer upper moon 2.
The Boss
Love you from Panamá.  Respect
The dance break 🔥🔥🔥
DOJA… ate and left ✨NO✨ crumbs 🤣😩 🍽️
C'est lourd !
I love that Doja isn't scared to step out and be herself 💗 I loved the performance she even went back to her roots of pop locking I love that she also did a 80s theme 🥰 I love everything about the 80s 💕 Doja deserved more of a reaction from the people in the audience people should've been up out their seats that girl served 💓
every time I get a like I come watch this video again, like my farts
the doja is like a fart to me, and I love farting
Like the commeent if you're a huge doja cat fan ❤👇
This is why i like the 80s this vibe is infectious
literally born to preform LOVE!!!
Havnt seen KG in a minute
so iconic
damn the mic sucks but WOW THOSE MOVES 🤩
omg this was litterally so amazing!!! doja ate this up
2:24 i really love this 😭✨
so so good!
Why is it all the celebs in the audience are just watching her like 😐 that was such an amazing and iconic performance you can’t deny!
Janet Jackson wannabe?  She can't dance or sing and there is nothing original to see or hear... Not sure why people don't like original artists.
You killed that
Yo Ámala you didn’t have to send me into a trance like that! 2:22  Her live prowess is damn formidable.
My wifeeee omagaaad
obsessed.
I honestly didn't know how much I missed the 80s until Doja and Miley put the front and center!!
I love it!!! ❤🎉
Damn, breaking out the vintage MJ moves is giving me OG MTV vibes 🫶🏼🤍
Kenny g o my days legend
@Eminem
Her ability to entertain is insane. If you saw pink in her prime at a concert this is that same level. Something that you rarely see
Doja might actually be the only singer/dancer/entertainer that reminds of Janet Jackson, especially with the education & experience with different styles of dancing
Why is the views low OMG
Yall kilt this Doja..I'm loving this 80's era vibes, I love the 80's✨️..and your a great performer Doja,everyone kilt this👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥🔥
Great instrumental. But can’t understand a single lyric. Whoever did the sound mixing on this track did a horrible job
⬛⬜️⬛⬜️⬛⬜️⬛⬜️
Iconic ❤ luv u doja
I love ❤
Is it just me or did this kinda sound like that’s so raven intro. 2:38  ❤❤
Thanks for uploading this better sound version!
They don't make em like this anymore!!
The 80s aesthetic is everything
The best ❤🌹😍
The Janet Jackson of the 2020s.
I've been listening to her since she started out, and I've always thought that if she listened to herself, things would go in the right direction. This little woman is brimming with talent. Well done!
SHE 👏🏽 DID 👏🏽 THAT 👏🏽👏🏽🎉🎉
so talented
Crazy good
Jojo cat ❤
a real Superstar
Amazing 🤩🤩🤩
Doja Girl you killed the vocals
Dance break was awesome 🎉🎉
GAG 🎉

I watched this on the VMAs! It was fantastic! ❤
lipsinging ☢️

thought she was cool until kenny gee. y?
She's talented
Everything was great but the audio. I've never heard this song before and could not understand any of the lyrics but the hook.
She's bringing back the 80s with this one
What’s 4+4??
Wow wow wow!!! Increíble Doja!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Bailas maravilloso!
Wow, this is REALLY the era. Can we get lyric videos too?
Queen
i fear shes the only pop star who devoured every aspect vocal, dance, stage performance. OH GODJA I NEVER DOUBT YOU!
I’m sorry but it’s killing me that no one is commenting on Kenny G’s performance and the fact that he apparently hasn’t aged at all?!?!
Queen 😊
Sorry but she fkn killed it hers and gagas were the best performances
As soon as Kenny G hit those notes I knew this was gonna be lit. And the friggin Max Headroom throwback at the start? Chefs kiss Doja! This was artistic gold!
Salute us 80s babies
mother, that was jaw dropping.
Ive never understood bein #JELOUSTYPE F EM

Doja killed this performance hands down my favorite of the show. Poppin was on point didn't know she had skills like that🔥🔥🔥🔥
There’s so much reference to Janet Jackson , how amazing is that for Doja !!This 80s whole aesthetic is something that I really miss from music. Thank you ❤
I wish she was still  the girl in a cow bikini 😢
Can't wait for the album to release 👅👅🔥
duuude! i still cannot get over this. such a goosebumps-inducing performance; from the max headroom reference, kenny g's interlude radiance, and even down to the fluid jackson essence. this is why you're my favourite~!! by the way, thank you for uploading it in pristine quality!! 🌹♡ 2014 and onwards, i'll never stop being a fan of yours.
Rap god
Lady Gaga is resting.
filha legítima de janet!
She never fails to stun me. WOW!
Definitely giving Janet Jackson inspired ❤
Did anyone else dream of being on the falling couch on this exact same stage as a child or nah
The notes she hits from 3:31 are everything. He dancing is epic but over all such a stellar performance. Eeee you can see the altar switch at 2:19
she's the one
Man I love this woman so much so underrated so talented and so beautiful I will always be in love with you woman❤
Okay nahhhhhhh they all ate this TF up!!! Especially that part where the one male dancer smashing the door to introduce the other male dancers😂❤ wicked

Doja I love you. Genuinely. I love seeing you do your thing. You literally have nothing else to prove. You’re a great artist that can; rap, sing, dance your a** off, and entertain in every genre of music. ❤
You are an INCREDIBLE ARTIST !
The sound quality's better than mtv's channel😂😂
OMG !! The high note ugh 😩 ✨
Mothet never failed when it comes to choreo.. The 80's looks had my eye bawling!
That was so good. <3
BIG LOVE FROM ISTANBUL DOJAAA❤

しゅき!!‪‪❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Estou simplesmente obcecada por essa apresentação, ficou perfeitaaaaa.
SPIRIT FINGERS! SPIRIT FINGERS ✨️
She is one of the only artists that gives star quality in her performances in this generation. A future legend honestly.

one of the best presentations
THEONEＷＨＯＣＡＮＲＬＬＹＤＡＮＣＥ
Como me tatuó este video?
tksm doja, ILU 😻
4:14  Paris: vibing with the music Conan: Spiritually concerned Sombr: Ethereally confused Glorilla: Vastly entertained  Vma fan attendees: understandably awestuck
You slay, honey
The dance break kind of sounds like a part of Love Never Felt so Good by MJ ft. Justin Timberlake.
idk why but the jump stomp walk was soooo satisfying to watch omg. vie boutta be a ERA .
You are fantastik 💙💙💙🫶
such an amazing artist & that mic was ON baby 😍🔥
Why did you upload this at night??
AATTEEE
SHES SO DOPE🎉
Doja Cat actually Tickin on the VMA stage was such the perfect nod to hip-hop and really prove to me once again she is a student of Culture. A true artist that does her homework, especially for this 80s era album that she is about to gag us wit. Can’t wait for the album and other surprises that she got up her sleeve
MAMAAA
I can’t wait to listen to the full album! Doja, keep being that amazing and versatile artist and dancer. I know you’ll kill it in this new era, too! Much love 💜💙
DOJA ATE THE VMA
I knew doja is extremely talented but this still left me overwhelmed when I first saw it because her isolation and precision is just crazy and I'm impressed by her even more
🥰🔥🔥
One of Doja's best comebacks hands down   BTW free Palestine
I love how there's so many nods to Janet Jackson in this performance. Even @3:55 the two background dancers with the piano-tar are reminiscent of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with Janet Jackson/The Time.
I pray to god this entire album is all that fierce 1988 Janet Jackson vibe.
Best performer of this generation
yes girl serve us nothing. did she sing more than 4 lines the entire performance ! GARBAGE!
Amazing performance
❤❤❤well dancing
Doja is very talented…one in a generation
Damn im early, love doja
Doja cat sa mérite un trophée 🏆 🏆 🏆
She’s still a RAPPER on her way to outperform HERSELF and the Concept — don’t get me starting
Best VMA performance
9 minutes❤
divaa
Doja is an inspiration😍, if you love her leave a ❤️
When she started pop locking 😩

Турбопушка.
SHE IS SOOO GOOD AT SINGING

How hard is she slapping 😫
Doja Cat never disappoints 😍
Is that Kenny G playing the soprano saxophone in the beginning?
This muthafucka a beast 🔥💚
DOJA i am indian kitten and I want a vinyl , i never have one , also broke ,plz help 🙏🏼😞
Anyone judging this for being weird needs to open their music history books.

It was the way Ariana & Lady Gaga was reacting Doja performing / singing Jealous Type for me ! (Even know you can’t see it in this video)
A PERFORMER A STAR BABY!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kenny G is still Kenny G. He aged well. As a kid growing up in the islands, this man ,Michael Jackson and Michael Bolton was always on my rotation🕺🏽🕺🏽

One thing about Doja, She definitely can sing, dance & perform. Her stage presence has definitely been immaculate & unmatched ! This woman is definitely the MOST greatest entertainer of ALL TIME !!! Nobody is doing it like her. She’s in her OWN lane when it comes to performing, dancing, singing & stage presence. This woman was really born to be a singer, a dancer, a rapper, & an entertainer. Doja Cat is a STAR ! 👑⭐️💅🏻😍🔥
