Oner did the same pose as Vi recalling after he got the World trophy as well.  🤣🤣
These the g2 skins we would have gotten if g2 ever won worlds
Man some of the effects like Pyke E look so good. I also love all the designs especially Yones, looks like a gothic high elf or something.
Man that Yone's skin looks sick! I wanted a Galio skin at first but this one turned out great.
trash skins
é o faquer
T1 Vi - The shortest skin name ever.
T1 Vi? ❌ TV       ✅
Zeus' head hitting the cup, it's really meaningful 😂😂😂😂😂
the new cover skins look great
Galio when Faker chose Yone: Σ(ﾟ口ﾟ;)//
Galio was robbed ;-;
Wth is that sht
there is no fkaign way  you gonna postt this sylas recall mororns put chains on him from all sidees and hes hands try to reach cup and add T1 logo to it ..... i cant wait for this color skins in other sets too wp ....
Zzzz adc skin
Dinguerie le skin d'ONER
this skins is a insane bro !!!!
I miss old skins they show the teams by far better this loons like ur average skin release like the other t1 skins in 2023.  I miss something like a logo or shit on the skins
T1 logo in Pyke R. Do it.
That gnar "bonk" And Varus " Is good" As well as oner's jacket/cape
How can i buy them? I cant find them in game ffs
What is this video format? 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
The only thing i like about that Sylas skin is Faker sign however that  Yone looks lit and that Varus is my 2nd favourite
i must say that the world skins this year are excellent ! <3
How much will the Sylas skin cost?
how many T1 skins are there like wtf ? doesnt  Riot support other teams????
Shut up and take my money!
Why is there 6? Why is there Sylas and Yone?
Love how they used oner's jacket like that
Holy shit i didn't think i was about to say this, but finally some actually good skins! it happens once in a decade, but well played devs
looks cool but looks super clunky imo
The first good skins riot release in like  a few years now... And they are really good, the thematics appears to be the Jailer from WoW + Red for T1, it's not exactly their nuance of red, but I like this dark one even more! Good job riot, you finally opened my wallet in like 5 years
Why no trophy for Guma?!!!  Oner's jacket is legit because Ober really just wear his jacket like that - just hanging!
一般。。
Maybe I'm out of the loop with the pro scene but I would have assumed Faker's skin would be Gallio since he literally won game 5 of the finals because of his Gallio play.
Pls bring it to wild rift🥹
Oner's Vi is aura farming
I prefer these over the world 2023 skins
Why are there 6?
Why there are 2 skins for Faker? Sylas and Yone.
The 5 stars on the ground from Yone’s W is badass
Worth every dollar big t1 fan but not a mega fan
RIP T1 RENATA YOU'RE ALWAYS BE MISSED </3
It’s not fair, why can’t these amazing skins come to wild rift?? 😩
this is probably the best team skins riot ever release that i want it to be an actual skin line like high noon and such, i dont even care about the teams and i will buy every single one of them lol. every single skin is godtier wth, that FX is so good. GJ rito
pyke sung jin woo dagger haha
Wow there’s are fantastic. Gotta be the best batch of Worlds skins to date.
why is varus the only skin with a T1 logo in the animation ???
where are the T1 logos ?
I dont like them that much, reminds me too much of the Marauder skin line, but the recalls are nice especially the oner one with his jacket
why 6 skin? who's the other one?  like  Gnar-zeus Sylas-faker Vi- oner Varus- gumayusi Pyke- keria Yone?
imma need china or korea itself to step up because for two years now worlds skins have been below mid
These skins are insanely good
Màu sắc trắng phục làm liên tưởng đến quân đoàn hắc ám
the special effects r kinda plain ngl. and where tf is the t1 logo other than in recalls?
Oner Jacket farming some aura
No team logo , kinda feel like another theme
It underwhelming tbh
looks like trump's victory is showing here too. Finally no more woke skins.
Omfg I wanna this skin on Yone
And I thought Faker would choose Galio 😢 it's the Galio that changes the flow of the  game in that series
Don't tell me that lissandra that looks like Yone won against GALIO??!!
Vi and pyke is the best one, sylas a little too much? Look like a mod skin in the community...
it took 5 Worlds championship but finally T1 got decent skin, still miss Galio and Xin tho, well i guess they need to win it again so we gonna get those.
Was so underwhelmed by previous year looking like it sponsored Colgate toothpaste and looked NOTHING like T1  Finally some gosh damn peak T1 skins
will they ever go back to making simple skins with clean sounds ? everything sounds like fucking exploding crystals and collapsing caves
The color and design is soo premium, finally we have a good T1 skins
Sylas is so bad, only red and red, and they says it's prestige level skin The rest of them is so good
imagine the whole team's b animation all got that trophy in their hand, but only Gumma got that Baron and crousaint 😂😂
That yone is sooooooooo cool 💦💦💦💦🥵🥵🥵
Noo they butchered the varus skin
the sound effects are hurting my ears
I can't see T1 in here.
Everyone is Coven Morgana
Can't wait for the day Shen gets a new team skin. probably never happen but one can dream
Nice new marauder skins
everything is perfect except that oner recall. honestly would be cool if they just made a jacket that matched the theme and made the words oner on it
The Varus skin of Gumayusi is almost detailed with his face on it, I noticed varus's chin is like gumayusi's 🔥
Oner's jacket and Gumayusi's croissant both are so cool
Compared to any Esport skin and the old T1.  By far the best ones.
cant compare to 2023
lol i thought zeus picked camille
Gnar  AAs are very annoying to listen to.
It's so good but i really want a Galio for faker
not the edgy sweat champs.  🫩 NEXT
楚雨荨这个模型看起来很不错~
The most ugly World Winners Skin ever
llore
Best world's skin so far damn thos lighting on Sylas
I’ve never thought the esports skins were any good. But these and the ones right before are just too good.
too bad
2 skins for the goat 💀
Why does the t1 skins look so basic
HOLY
Wow, yet more poorly designed ranked skins meant purely to sell out advertisment for T1 that will be largely forgotten the second a new skin wave comes out so exciting amazing awesome sauce
SO RIOT MEANS THEY RELEASE SYLAS IN WILD RIFT NEXT SEASON. BECAUSE YONE,VI,GNAR,VARUS AND PYKE IS IN WILD RIFT. ONLY SYLAS LEFT
K đẹp lắm nhỉ
wish have all of this on wild rift🤤
Faker sylas skin is best
It's a bit infuriating that yone was chosen instead of galio
Vi Aura ❤
Imagine if zeus is in t1 and they use these again in worlds it will so manace !!
Chovy still 0 skins 😂
they should add more to make these (specifically faker’s skins) feel more t1. like add a logo or 5 stars to yone’s ult. or to sylas q. sylas seems more like a marauder skin than t1 besides the recall, bit underwhelmed by that one
Its similar to coven skinline
Am I the only who just thinks the skin looks like an alternate time line where they are from noxus?
Feel like coven or old god more than championship skin
Worst T1/SKT skin series by FAR, I'd even say worst worlds skin lineup, feels so lazy and without personality, couple of cool recall animations but that's it, and it seems like people are eating this shit up and cheering on it. Sad to see how low standards are nowadays.
i get it for the money but showcase another player other than faker for the prestige skin please! Give the other players a chance!
They look same as marauder skins. No wonder RIOT don't let Oner pick Xin Zhao cause we already got T1 Xin Zhao skin lol.
와 간지 ㅈ된다
Looks like Noxian Skin Line instead of T1
I usually don't care for world skins but riot really coming with heat for this set of skins. All of them are hellla good.
These are crazyyyyy
No T1 logo on the skills of Gnar and Vi😢
Beautiful!
Heavy is the crown theme sheesh
DAMN Faker really got the Conqueror Haki theme skins, LESGO
The skins are nice but am i the only one who wouldnt be surprised if these were pentakill skins instead, they seem rather close 👀
Galio deserved that skin, not yone, but well riot says they honor the players when they only care about money, if not ask Azir.    Ahri´s skin  that was to honor faker, if thats the case that Skin should had been for Azir.
Still no Vex skins 💀
make it gold instead of silver please…these looks like marauder skin🤦‍♂️
No gonna lie... these are the best world's skins.  The different touches are just cheeky enough without being overpowering. The effects are really well done.  I hope the splash arts are just as good!
Gangs all here! Faker, Zeus, Oner, Guma, and Kevin! *whispers* I know it's Keria, but it looks like Kevin at first glance, that's the joke. *more whispering* Oh I'M SORRY for trying to bring humor to this world along with these cool skins. Jerk. *loud whispering* Maybe I will take it up with HR! Sick of this. (Walks out)
2:52 Who’s kevin?
Sao nó không có 1 tí t1 nào
it looks coven to me
Varus >>>> todas las skins
They actually cooked! What year is this?
Sao trông nó lại như thế này
2:43 Trophy effect for every pyke R kill would be a chef's kiss for the skin. Imagine a pentakill equivalent to the 5 championship trophies of T1.
coven yone
I liked the Vi skin till i saw the jacket
This might just be the coolest World skin
Ngl, this looks like the recolored version of the IG Skins lol.
Oh my god, how much more richer t1 could get, im so jealous ❤, being a millionaire for doing what you enjoy
Oner vi skin baby!!
the sound effects are really grating, but the visuals are sick.
gnars skin looks awful
Does anyone know the reference of pyke recall? I know everyone else’s: gnar: zeus hitting his head with a trophy, yone: the faker pose, varus: guma eating croissant, and vi: the oner style jacket
Jesus Cristo 😢
About time we got some good world skins!
I don't like them (crying emoji face)
man that poor specific spot of land 😢
the recalls are insane, but you cant say they are World Winners skins without that
looks like Conqueror skin line nice
No one's notice about atlas recall that 4 strikes is zed ryze syndra and oriana
Why the hell its look like a childs of Morauder and Coven ? 🤨🤨
IS GOOOOOOOD
Yone Targaryen
Nice
Rather disappointing tbh. They don’t look like worlds skins but rather marauder’s. No T1 logo what so ever. Worst Worlds skins ever IMO
Is Rekkles the ward skin?
Their recall are amazing but I don't really like that the skins went too far from being "characters dressed as team fans" like the first ones. Into just some stylish skin with the logo on certain animations for you to remember is a team skin.
At this point just call the skin line "Faker and his little friends"
more T1 logo pls
It's GOOODDDDD..!!!!!!
Galio should have gotten it.
Is anyone gonna talk about the sylas crown/horns representing Fakers demon king name when he steals an ult. That is some good detail to this skin line. Thank you for cooking designers.
i'm so pissed that zeus took gnar and not Camille, omfg
sylas' its gonna be extra expensive... damn
Vi recall is fire tffff
I thought that was Twinktor in the splash art 😂
finally a T1's badass skins
Nice skins, but BLG should've won instead.
Finally.. About time they announce this skin set, & who are in it.
Looks like marauder skin line imo
Is goood
Need more T1 logo on skills rito tbh  You could do better than this
2:10  Varus : IT'S GOOOOOOOOD!!
no galio? :(
Darkin t1 skins
i really hope they make yones red sword alittle more spikey
shoulda been ashe/xayah for guma and renata for keria - guma only played 1 game of varus and keria only played 2 games of pyke.
these are alll SOOOO good its insane
Lmao the prestige skill looks the worst, like just a blurred mist of red color with no deals while all the normals skins have black, silver & red with very clear details.
If you show me the skins without me knowing they are from t1, I wouldn't know
Me with the thumbnail: ah, lissandra skin, no?  ...😂😂😂
Why ever on earth faker has to get 2 Skins.  But ehy whatever lookin good.
sylas prestige doesnt feel prestige
last yr t1 was better than this looks like 1300 rp skins
can someone spike fakers monster energy, I need new drx skins
Marauder skin line
It's just me or these skins look kinda ass. Look like some battlepass skin ngl
This is more like T1, last year was more of a BLG themed skin if not chroma
Not me thinking that this is lissandra on preview instead of Yone 😭😭😭
That music at the end was nasty
Why Faker got two? I mean nice but i wonder, above that the skins are amazing!
The yone sfx makes my teeth hurt
boring
W skin for T1
marauder 2.0
Galio was robbed.
Vi looks like shes using conq haki
Lets go for another yone skin .... Yeahhh... 😡
He didn't even used Yone that well lol. Should've been Galio.
where's the gold, t1 isn't jsut red.
yone got the murasama fr
Amazingggg 👍 Well let's get another world skins this year T1, 6th 🏆 is for Doran 😎 T1 fighting!!! Get back on track 💪👊
Hmnn nothing special huh.
Omg guys look its the millionth yone and pyke skin woohooo
I need to find a job ASAP so I can get some of these 😭
mid as hell
❤Pyke ❤
Nobody is gonna buy these overrated ugly skins 🥱🥱🥱
So comment section, what the damage this is gonna do on my wallet?
Pyke+yone purchased
Esta bacana pero, T1 siempre pierde con Gen.g  absurdo, no valdría la pena .
I thought this was project lmao
Great  job Riot Games
do we  know the price of each skin ?
Why does prestige has to be a different champ now, and now it has to be my main😢
All the skins look sick. Big question mark for me though is Faker Yone. If any T1 player would get Yone shouldve been Zeus. Faker could play it in a pinch but Zeus Yone was the real pick people actually feared.  If we were doing 2 skins for Faker and his legacy deathcap Galio wouldve cooler IMO. Besides that Oner Vi recall is probably the coolest recall for me. You know that the jacket on shoulders is Oner even if they removed the nameplate. If Oner ever gets to the hall of legends would love a Xin Zhao skin.
Siempre usan los mismos campeones en campeonatos ... Que aburridos
G2 skinline xD
T1 tone xấu điên
not that i'm upset at the designs overall, but why yone
Broken Covenant T1 skinline
Sick Coven skins
Yone doing fakers 'Shh' emote is peak on the recall
Boring skins 🥱🥱🥱
welcome back pentakill skins
i like how the shade of red is similar to eternum. really cool
noooo it's not t1 galio
Remember when the Worlds skins would come out in April? Pepperidge Farms remembers...
by far the ugliest T1 skins they've released
not gonna lie, those could easily be G2 theme skins with this colors....
yone doing the cringy emote at the end... yuk
Yup. I'm buying them all.   Specially that Vi skin
Just coven skins, nothing cool
Naaah the Vi jacket is OD 💀💀
yone aurafarming recall
Sylas's Recall  hoped the trophy popped up earlier for 1 more second
T1 PYKE SHOULD HAVE HEAVY IS THE CROWN IN THE PENTAKILL
nice RECOLORED Demon VI
So, previous year T1 skins are light mode and these ones are dark mode?
normlitas
I don't know Drx seems better, somewhat disappointed since it's T1 I mean it's not that bad but i expected much more at least on the recalls
the sylas skin has literaly not a single T1 logo in it :/
캬ㅏㅏ T1최고다. 사일 귀환모션 사슬 묶이는거랑 떨쳐내는거 1세트 패배 2세트 승리. 댓글에서 이런거 나타낸거라던데
Finally a Pyke skin that remembers his Bilgewater days
sylas is insane.
I need the yone skin but galio got robbed 😭
I think the T1 symbol was missing from the skins to make it look nice, just like Pyke's ult with the symbol would be really beautiful
how about taunts, death animations and respawn animations ?
The ugly marauder skin line is back i see
The theme is... metal... high noon..?
Guma stealing baron in the recall is such a good detail
Those skins look awesome
will t1 jinx come back with the new ones or is it only in chests?
pls take my money
bruh that sound effect on that varus bread was so crisp
Yone so pretty i simp 😢❤
and the prestigious one of Sylas??
As a Yone one trick, im EXCITED ASF for this skin. It has my favorite color combination, too!
they look like Marauder skins but better~
all the references! IS GOOD!
The skins look more like NOXUS than the current 😂
Missed opportunity for yone having faker "shh" pose inside that ult.
I want more T1 in this new skin👍
another year another line of SKT skins, yawn
Holy V rising skin line
Oh cool they brought back the marauder skinline. Weird, they usually do warden skins with these too
No MVP prestige skin?
what ever it is, this team left their mark in the game, and skins look cool If . I can afford it :) i might buy them
Its gooooood
That Sylas with the ult really is the embodiment of 'unkillable demon king'
Recycled skins from other concepts, without the logo you can't tell it's T1.
Varus >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
LOL
I thought yone gets a Prestige skin?
How muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Well at least the canonical RED theme is on this time.
It looks like Pentakills to me.😂😂😂
a gnar skin, i must be dreaming
Okay, the Yone one is pretty fire
more effects doesn't mean better skin as we can see from video
Its soooo bad plz remake it
man it needed to be an ''IT'S GOOD'' when guma eat the croissant
0:21 4 lightning strikes: Zed, Rize, Syndra and Orianna
Take my money riot games 😵
The effort on these recalls🔥
Yone Vương Lâm
The sylas skin is just another chroma of ashen slayer sylas. I literally don't see any T1 logos.
Yone reminds me of Sephiroth
Galio deserved a faker skin
so cool
this yone is lowkey giving coven evelynn i luv it
Zofgk má ơiii
So perfect,but Yone is The best 🤫
I wish they emphasize more that they won back2back, to feel more unique
Is this covenant?
Trash champs for toxic kids, except Gnar and varus
Prestige should have been yone. Sylas does not have a kit that can make the prestige effect shine. İt does not even look different from the others. Damn shame. Another L for rito
Guys where's Galio skin 🥹🥀
향후 10년간 사일러스 근본스킨 무변동 예정
I dunno much about the references and names in League's esports scene but at least I'm glad the Champions choice was much better than before
Wth is a prestige at this point like is it just bulkier vfx now???? Like that sylas skin is just another casual T1 skin
Where is reckless skin?
If Oner's Costume replaced the jersey with a cloak it would be perfect
These honestly looks great across the board, lots of personality in the recalls as well. The only one that feels a little weaker than the rest is the Yone one.
Sorry, it was METAL RED EDG at first glance 😢😅  it looks cool tho
Black and red, this is gotta be the best worlds skin ngl
MVP gets two skins this year or it's always been like this?
Thnks Keria for choosing pike as your choice🔥
So is it T1 Gnar or HLE Gnar?
Dios mío, pero calidad que tienen estos aspectos, por lo general los aspectos de campeones no destacan mucho, pero en esta ocasión se sacaron la salchicha, la pusieron sobre la mesa, y la partieron en 2
The Oner Jacket looks a bit odd, it needs to be made to look more realistic.
Yone looks like Coven Lissandra 💀
Actually quality skins, wow, finally
i think gnar is the best, second is sylas, 3 others is ok
THIS IS GREAT
both Faker skins have barely any T1-resemblance in comparison to the others apart from their recall which is really odd.
I can only tell they are T1 skins by recall. Pretty sad
since i've accepted new prestige skins will not be like a fashion show, i've started to apreciate it and understand that Prestige is not about fashion anymore. Prestige 3.0 is just a middle ground between an epic and legendary skin.
These are good, they just look a little too much like the Marauder skins and don’t have the team logo on the spell effects as much as previous worlds skins (something that I personally like to see, at least on the ultimate). These are better than most worlds skins but probably not above EDG and IG.
Gnar best
What did pyke recall refers to?
gave faker 2 skins just to make sales , even tho bro barely did anything last worlds
Yone mains, we are eating good this day
Yone is a prestige??
Finally
Mãi mới thấy skin T1, háo hức từ tháng năm ngoái tới giờ.
Return of the conqueror skins looks amazing
the first good yone skin since spirit blossom lol
I thought Yone was Lissandra at first.
Am I the only one who doesn't like the sfx? Feels not menacing, except Pyke W for me. But I like the skins tho. (Can't afford them anyway so I'll shut up)
They do not look like T1 at all, more like pentakill skins. you have to look closely just to see the logo… but anyways I hope they i,prove since it is PBE, Oner’s recall is pure aura
Huh, didn't expect the skins to be this cool. Might have to give Riot props for T1 Sylas, Pyke, Varus and Yone.
meh...
at least pyke is not as ugly as bard, but it should be renata... maybe this year
RIP my wallet, these skins are beautiful
They should have ha an Ashe arrow flying in at the last secondd during yone recall
IsnSylas prestige or Yone?
Stygian Zynogre Mega Gnar OMGGGGG
The skins sound 'wet' I don't like that
muito foda as skins desgraça do lol fazendo eu abrir a carteira de novo
Sylas needs more emphasis on the T1 logo. It is barely visible, making it hard to tell that he's a T1 skins. I hope they make it more visible in the final product
"I feel like Yone's ultimate skill in this skin is quite underwhelming — I hope they add some kind of effect, like Faker's signature or the T1 logo, for example."
They should made Pyke (Keria) picks up his trophy from treasure chest.
this is COOL LIKE IG skins wow pyke recall is on PEAK!
Nice to know Pyke gets skins like this unlike Ivern.
I don’t like the “evil” motif I like when it’s more regal  These look like better penta kill skins… the vfx are pretty good but I definitely don’t like them that much
I feel like gnar doesnt have much changes...? I mean, check SSG he has new model, but T1 feel like classic model with few changes :c
1. Is the prestige with us in the room? 2. They look like Marauder skins
Fakers got more championship skins alone then some champion teams 😂
t1 sylas ? default
2:12 It's good!!!!
Yone Skin looks sick but the attack sounds are terrible
mid
เท่มากกก แต่มีแต่ตัวที่ไม่ได้เล่น 555
Huuuuuge W!!!
I wanted to see Faker in the soul unbound while controlling Yone
The Gnar recall is pretty good, except for the fact that the dude associated with the skin left the team for an even worse team that does not play around him the same way T1 does.
there's a normal size croissant lol
Varus auto attacks disappointed me 😢  I was hoping they would make the animation feel snappy and sharp, but it's very mediocre.
looks like Marauder skin line.
not too shaby
Guma: its good!!!!!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks these could’ve been a lot better? Best one here is probably Varus
Bro fuck me, i love em all, i might spend way too much money on this. Every single skin looks like a 1v9 demon king    THE CURSE HAS BEEN LIFTED
wow vi la mejor con diferencia!!!!
I will be the @hole that complains here but somehow the Prestige Sylas looks the worst even though it is the most expensive, the other looks cool though.   There isn't any element reminding people of T1 with the Sylas skin, even his going back effect is bad. At least make the Q explosion with T1 symbol or even better, give it special T1 symbol effects when Sylas steal ultimate from: Galio, Gnar, Rakan (only 3 most memorable ones, not too many).
Those are very smooth!!! 💜
That *shh* from Yone is also a good nod to the Unkillable Demon King.
Yes, I will go 0/10 on Pyke as soon as these skins drop.
Ok these skins are badass! The colors, the vfx, and the recalls?? Mamma mia.
This set might be on par with 2018 ig skins
Finally, a cool look for Sylas, and no damn galaxy, shameful wolf and frostbitten chosen ones.
I'm gonna buy this sh*t  My credit card is ready for this T1 skin even is 500 dollar I'm still buying this 😮😮😮😮
Sylas looks like a demon king, thats all i wanted, thx  kinda sad that the 2nd skin is yone and not galio, but galio will be his 2nd imortal demon king hall of legends skin ahhaha
best skin so far after IG skin
gnar skin completely butchered, what is this toy
Tell me it's not coven skin without telling me. It is 😂
Yone E is out of the league
COVEN ?? 😂😂
The Varus and Vi recalls are cool af
yones not ready for me.
The T1 logo on Yones spirit cleave is clean
New pentakill skins, tks god
Gumayusi should've forced riot to make a smolder skin
Nothing against T1 or anything, but I'm tired of seeing those skins. At this point, every champion in the game will have one of these skins
Yone animation is for KATANA(slash), but they do the skin into Midieval sword(stab and 2 handed), it’s look abit weird to me.  I like the Varus skin, gotta take it even i only play TFT 😂
ISSSSS GOOOOOOOOOD!
Just me or are they too bright n flashy id go blind ingame
Sylas skin raised the bar so high that the other skins look super mid
超帥
I miss the day when champion winners skins were just champions with Gaming clothing using the team's colors
These gotta be the best team skins by far, they cooked 5 star meal with pyke. He looks like a mix of ashen knight and pentakill
Se les nota que le pusieron poco esfuerzo en hacer las skins
I need T1 VI, and T1 Sylas 😩
Best T1skins after 5 wins. finally..
cool effects, outfit designs not my taste
And zed gets the woke skins
IT'S GOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!
zeus headbutt, oner jacket, guma croissant and its good, faker yone "quite". My fav skill animation is varus W Q, that is sick.
They look cool but low key they felt like Arcana skins with T1 effects.
Holy whatever skins bro, except one or two recalls everthing is so idc... and dont even tell me about oner's jacket also prestige sylas my *, mf is just a normal red skin like the whole line
i thought guma and keria gonna chose xayah rakkan 😢
Marauder x Coven skin 😂
If I'm not mistaken, this is the first time in the history of Worlds that a non-tank or enchanting support has a Worlds Winners skin.
Oner recall signature jacket
Another good skin line after IG 😊
The new Marauder skins look mid as hell
This is actually what people wanted for the 2023 skins 😄 Anyway Riot did a great job
faker sylas base animation is all time aura farmer. Zed, ryze, syndra, orianna and breaking the chains to win the fifth trophy from the brink of lost with that sylas game.
They cooked fr
I love New Noxus skins..... w8 Is that T1 skins ?
marauder
It seems like they are eternum skins
Why Varus recall doesn't have a cup?
Nice chromas😂
skins are really cool but wish there was more t1 aspects to the skins, still gonna buy them lol
Suddenly they know how to make good epic skins, someone definitly told them they need to make it better because its faker team or something like that. Now compare these skins to recent legendary VI skin.
Holy shit they chose actually cool characters instead of 4 generic anime babes + Aatrox like last year no way
Pénta kill ?
I kinda hate that jacket in the recall. ;(
Thxs Faker for the Yone skin 😔🙏🙏
we only get prestige version of sylas?
shut up just take my money
Vi recall is crazy
Sylas skin still no good
I love it, I love it, I LOVEEE ITTTT!!!!
Wait wasnt yone getting the prestige skin?
0:42 Maserati??
riot hết ý tưởng, skin kiểu lai tạp giữa toán cướp hắc ám đổi qua tông màu điểm đỏ, 1 chút giống skin edg, cảm giác là lấy cảm hứng từ khung của skin đại sảnh huyền thoại , k thấy độc đáo như skin năm ngoái
Coven lite lol
I thought it was a bit lacking in showing the T1 symbol on the Skin, it erases quickly, Gnar's W and R would look better, imagine if Pyke's ult shows a "T1" when executing the enemy, Yone's R leaves the trail of T1 or Faker's name, but the skins are VERY BEAUTIFUL
All the skins are amazing, it just feels like yone doesn't make sense. Poor Galio but overall best T1 skins ao far...
Heck yea, My wallet bout to Bleed with this Sylas and Pyke skin.
So much better in action that is riots trailer 😅
looks like continuation of fakers 500$ skin line
Sylas' skin really feels prestige, It looks amazing
Maybe they didn't pick Galio or convinced Faker not to because someone's already making their own design. What a disappointment.  Skins not bad tho, just heavymetal seems pretty new to me.
The yone skin looks awful
IS GUUUUUD, LE CROISSANT
YONE W is soo goated
Why is it not Red Gold for T1, the color scheme is generic
sợi xich của ruler cuối cùng cũng được phá
They look amazing but the sound is kinda off idk
holy drip marketing that Yone Artwork and the skin looks cold af
why the betrayal guy chose gnar ? 😂
Gotta say these look pretty damn good
Imagine how much better a T1 Xin Zhao would've looked.
Namoral, quem diz que essas skins são da T1? Totalmente fora do tema só tem T1 no nome
you KNOW they had to reference that baron steal with the varus recall thats cleeeean
Nah - Guma’s recall is priceless 🤣🤣
Man im disappointed
These look like Sith skins not T1 lol. Not complaining tho.
umm the sylas one does not feel like T1 skin it feels like Eternum nocturne
Má ơi nó xấu, rất ít hình ảnh T1
Why do they look like L9 custom skins lmao that's horrible
Sylas transforming into a demon to demonstrate the moment where Faker returned to his old self, Unkillable Demon King, and save T1 from a defeat against the best team, Bilibili, and Knight in the best moment with Bin.
ugly
These are actually really nicely done. Much better than last years skins.
IS IT ALWAYS AN INVISIBLE AMUMU YOUR BEATING UP ON?! poor guy cant catch a break
*Electrocute skins* be like:
Keria had no theme for the recall animation, so he just created the coolest one in history.
that Yone's W with 5 stars is on fire
TWO SKINS FOR FAKER?WHOA 😮
THAT VARUS RECALL WITH CROISSANT,   IS GOOOOD 🗣🥖🥖
I hate shorts format
vãi lz t thấy 2024 đẹp hơn, đỏ đen trông phản diện vl
that varus skin IIIIIIIISSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
Why Zeus got 2 champions?
that Varus skin is so sexy
These skins go crazy af
Pyke is the best skin
give the sfx team a raise the sounds of crazy
these skins are so underwhelming i wanna say they are sht tbh
Yeah guys, i think ashen knight pyke has some real tough competition now... Haha
Close enough. Welcome back elder prince Lorian.
Disgusting male chars 🤮
전설급 퀄리티 우승 스킨은 LPL 리그가 우승하면 이뤄질 겁니다😂
The fact that yone got a team skin before yasuo is insane to me.
Yone E skill looks legendary effect
What in the marauder
sylas so bad,fk riot
Idk if its just me but the vfx/aesthetic looks like the Marauder skin line (the one with Kalista and Xin Zhao)
ITS GOOD!!!!
Yone just gives Pontiff Sulyvahn's vibe so much
ngl, this is the first time they have made rly good T1 Skins. It's about time!
jacket oner = AURA
Disappointment. Looks like old pentakill + broken covenant
the "IS GOOOOOD" recall omg
they cooked they cooked they cooked they cooked they cooked
THE CROISSANT
Oner recall is INSANE
Giving yone a skin and not galio is crazy
literally thoguht this was marauder skinline like...
Finally, some REALLY good skins that I HOPE AREN'T PART OF THE GACHA SYSTEM also love the color scheme, black and red go so well for T1
I think the pyke skin might be on the same level as Ashen knight, holy incredible work on these skins
Close enough...  Welcome back, Eternum skin line!
Pyke become Spyke Gnar is my favourite
how nice is that pyke skin btw
pyke pentakill @@
The Gnar W proc sounds so crisp
Guma picking Varus is probably the best choice in this year's lineup, he finally got his esports skin
Gnar is easily the best. It feels the most personal and actually has some character.
Color palette matches darkin theme too holy
Lorian Yone
Vi hunter hunter reference lol
they are all meh
Can't wait for the T1 skins 2025
외형걍 악의여단이랑 다를게뭐임 ㅋㅋ
They should have made yone w with iconic faker 🤫 like in splash art, huge miss........
real demonking skin
holy 2 more faker skin. ☠️
Que skin prestígio patética
Glad this year skins are ugly af, gonna sabe me real money
xd even esport skins are better quality then battle pass skins thats trying to pretend being epic skins....
Youtube: 24 t1 worlds skin is fire. Facebook: not good. Pentakill rip off.  Skin is good, they lifted the heavy crown. But would've been better if that yone skin was galio.
Surely the Sylas skin won't be another $500 scam case, right? RIGHT?!
超好看...
I hope they change sylas like in the concept
Varus stealing the Baron even in the back 😂
Sad we didn't get prestige galio but the sylas skin is just as good.
Instead of Yone it had to be Galio but wanna be edgy alledgely T1 fans voted for Yone which has no historical context Galio 5 games against RNG worlds 2017 and Clutch galio final engage in 2024
Revendreth Yone
Infinitely better than their last one. Can't wait to finally get new T1 skins cuz I skipped than one.
T1 Yone!!!!
T1 never beating the villain allegations 😂😂😂
than yone is so alucard 😍😍
wait, did they hint that if u get a pentakill with t1 pyke heavy is the crown starts playing in game?
Why Faker has 2 skins? 😮
Allright Boyz, pyke is clearly the winner here
Varus: "its GOODDD!!!"
Oh man riot totally outdid themselves on this one, the quirky recalls with throwbacks to everyones moments really seals the deal. Easily the coolest worlds skin lineup ever.
Ahh so this is why Gnar got a buff 🤪
fantastic skins, 10000/10 actual peak
Sylas is hitting the Ashen Knight itch his actual Ashen Knight skin failed to
They should add a custom text line for Varus for if you steal an objective :>
omg sylas :O
Sylas and Pyke ones looks amazing
Finally, these are high quality in terms of effects. Comparing to currently epics and battle pass skins, these are far better.
I usually don't like team skins, and not because they don't look good but because PERSONALLY I never liked the concept of a champion literally representing an IRL person, it kinda always threw me off the game immersion   But I must admit, this batch's design is absolutely top notch
holu fuck i love yone i love yone i love yone
Nét căng
The best skins ive seen in a while!
Yes yone so cool😮
Finally and varus and yone skin...yow so cool
not bad for the new Marauder skins
Does pyke recall have a meaning? Enlighten me
I wish that Doran gets his T1 skin next year too. T1 fighting! The skins are great, and it helps that the bar isn’t too high because 2023 skins were meh
So it’s a Coven knock off?
YES ANOTHER PYKE SKIN
Huh, the pyke is sick dont get me wrong, but I figured Keria would have gotten that Lux.
Damn, Pre T1 Sylas so fk cool @@ look at the effect. Goodjob Riotttt
Love the varus croissant and vi oner jacket recall and can't wait for keria to spam pyke skin like bard
FINALLY a team skin line that’s not white/blue/gold!
Skins look great but I was hoping to see 5 stars on Faker recall or ult.
It would be better if everyone wearing same like Oner recall, looks like EDG worlds 2021chromas skin
CADE AS FADINHAS RIOTTTTT
Holy sht the details is crazy for the sylas, though i thought the T1 sign can be show abit more (currently i only see the logo during recall animation). But the recall animation showing all 4 faker previous skins silhouettes is lit 🔥,  zed,ryze,so draw,orianna
is sylas' skin going to be as impossible to get as the rest of the mythic skins ? you can hardly get mythic essence anymore and why is noone talking about this i feel like im going insane. Mythic skins are literally almost as hard to get as exalted skins these days since the only reliable way to get essence is through the gacha, which gives you roughly 4-5 ME on average for every roll. WHY ARE PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT THIS WHEN LITERALLY 99.9% OF THE COMMUNITY CANT EVEN AFFORD IT.
Megamind Gnar
WOOOOOOOOOW PYKE SKIN SNAILED IT!
How can riot miss 5 times in a row? 😂
진심 나르요네사일바이파이크 다 잘나옴 특히 귀환모션 이펙트들 미쳤다
Im gonna stress it out: is so fk amazing sylas skin looks and fits perfectly with the other 5 basically being a 6th skin without the boring ass gold/crystal shit that usually prestige skins are  This also tackles the issue sylas or yone mains might had about not getting the prestige /normal version because BOTH are and look like the rest of the skins   So there really is nothing prestige about prestige is just a peak skin like the rest
Question: Why does Faker have a Prestige Sylas skin and a Yone skin? I thought it was a Skin + Prestige of the same champ for MVPs.
They pay homage to Oner's admiral Jacket drip and Guma's Croissant eating moment in their respective skins. Loved to see that.
What if Pyke got a star above the T1 logo every time he killed with his R?
I dont mean to say that the 2023 skins are bad, but the T1 is finally getting skins worthy of them
ITS GOOOOD
왜 파이크한테 머리카락이 있지?
Bro, that pyke skin was pay to win. I thought it was yone’s 3rd skill
damn im getting that sylas
Damn they are dominant
Worth
It's good🥐
The color and animations are so clean  But Im not sure about the slyas skin even though is cool doesn't really have much t1 references
We need SKTT1  Ahri plz
역대 월즈 스킨중 ig 다음으로 제일 잘나왔다 역대급임😮😮😮❤❤
bro if they pick rammus we're fckd
Yone now is ser Authur Dayne
sfxs so bad
finallyyyy a good sylas skin after freljord and with nightbringer yasuo vibes too?
Where is T1 galio 😢😢😢
all skins are AMAZING
Even before watching the video I already know ppl gonna complain about the previous year W's Skin ='))
Dude this is Merauders 2.0 and calling Sylas a Prestige skin is an insult lol
all the skins were ok until i saw Varus(i mean if you look at the overall skin it looks very plastic) eww
Mid ah skins
Holy gnarito skin finally ive been waiting for you
New marauder skins, or someone replaced orange with red on pentakill?
Please let us have chromas for these, these skins are absolutely beautiful👨🏾‍🍳🤌🏾
This kinds are so underwhelming... It looks just like chromas of older skins... Varus and Gnar are just ok.
Would have loved to see a T1 Galio
The skins are good and all but I'm sorry, the prestige isn't prestige at all
Oner's recall is insane, wtf
Amazing skins once again for t1 🙏🏼
That vi recall with oner's jacket looks so cool.
Oh that was Yone in the thumbnail?! I thought it was Lissandra
Guma choosing Jhin would have been much better...
HOLY SHIT THAT SYLAS
NGL best t1 skins ever
What's surprising to me, apart from how well done these skins are compared to those of 2023, is the detail they added with Gnar's hit with the trophy as well as Zeus, Guma's croissant and Oner's jacket. That's incredible, it gives essence to the skins.
Gooooootdaaaaaaamn that sylas looks crazy....
2024?
Eternum sylas Eternum Yone Eternum Vi Eternum Gnar Eternum Pyke Eternum Varus Nice :d
Effects are sooo awesome
Sadly it wasn't Renata
Yone my beloved 💐
습격자 테마랑 되게 비슷한듯 이래서 신짜오 안된다고 햇구나
Now we have T1 Vi to go along with T1 Jinx 💪🏻
other than sylas all of the skins look cool
Ok best skin world now 🔥 everything so perfect
L toplaner
Bruh, Zeus turns his moment when he hit his head with the cup into the recall animation 😮😮😮 👍🏻
Big Gnar look like colored default Gnar.:))))
this varus is so amazing 😀
크로마도 예쁘다는데 기본도 꽤 괜찮아서 기대되네
did they recycle high noon yone into this one?
습격자 테마랑 되게 비슷하네 이래서 신짜오 빠꾸시켯구나
is vi’s skin legendary? her animations look different from base
sephiroth yone
I failed to get Ahri faker skin but I can get yone skin hahaha with signature
pyke penta effect
Black mixed with Red is perfect 😮😮😮😮 And the crown on Sylas head!!! Love it
This is pentakill, not T1
2:10 "isssss gud!!!"
Vi (Oner) : A-U-R-A
개좋아
진짜 ㅈ터지게 예쁘네 스킨
Omfg they referenced the trophy head bump whatever you call it
Oner's jacket style while walking is so 🔥
OMG that Vi skin sooooo good
I've been waiting on this my whole life
How tf they managed to code Oner's jersey? XD
pyke nhìn đã mắt v
Looks like left over skins from noxian season
Croissant 🥐
sylas is the best in my opinion
I love Skin Pyke <3
They should hire Keria for skin development department. His creativity and unique idea will make huge profit
The gnar recall hahaha😂 The Oner jacket The stealing baron  Damn they cooked
imagine that sylas best skin isnt even the legendary
이건 악의 여단 시리즈 아니노..
boooo its just marauder
these are pretty boring
These blow 2023 skins out of the water. Absolutely stunning, can't wait for them to drop!!!!!
this was the lineuo that should had ahri?  so cool
Yone using Haki
Quá đẹp
23보다 훨괜찮긴한데 색감이 너무 미치것네 진짜 크로마 기똥차게좀 뽑아봐 제발
No compraré ninguno muy zzz
Without a doubt and in my personal opinion the best skins of the year outside of so much gacha, I like the animations and that dark aspect very well done
Quando vocês querem vocês trabalham né. ! libera quem faz o jogo acontecer.
with a coven's old gods theme to it...i like it
THE GNAR ZEUS RECALL AND GUMA VARUS WITH THE CROISSANT RECALL HOLY THEY  ACTUALLY DID IT HOLYYYYY !
롤역사상최고
They're like Coven + Ethernum. The weight and texture is so good. This is at first glance review btw.
HEAVY IS THE CROWN 👑
NOW THIS IS A T1 SKIN
Holy, all of these are so damn CLEAN!! Where is this level of quality outside of esports skins, Riot?!
Pyke as usual has the aura farm skin and it works😂😌
Sylus is just like demon king
Nice skins
T1 has so much skins now they can be a synergy in TFT Sets lol /summon @Riot Mortdog
not good not bad
That Sylas skin is fire, this is the first Sylas skin that i actually really like since Fredjorld lol, his ¨legendary¨ skin was straight up a fcking joke so ill take this as an apoligy lmao. I dislike the stupid half face helmet but it goes when you have a stolen ult so im fine. A shame the Splashart shows the helmet and its also kinda generic, i would have prefered to see Sylas (Faker) sitting in a throne (demacian throne pog?)  with a smirk but this is my opinion, im really happy with this skin anyways.
Galio: Its over, they forgot me.
This Yone's skills and model have some weight in it! I LOVE IT!
Something between the Marauder and Pentakill line. Looks weak. There are so many skins for Pyke that the line of difference between them is erased.
The freaking croissant is hilarious!
They all look amazing actually
The pyke😱
I think pyke it's so pretty
Faker!!!!대상혁의 스킨들👍👍👍
coven
So much better than 23 guys
It's 1.350 RP?
Faker : yone and sylas look peak !!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A pyke world skin I ised to dream for times like these My boi got justice
I’m defo buying the whole bundle + the Sylas prestige when they drop. Best worlds skins imo
Faker +2  Choky +0
One Jacket Recall Is  🔥 🔥 🔥
Skin Vi look normal
iG now has a competition
Bad ass t1 skin
와씨.... 기다릴만하네! 퀄리티 미쳤다
Love the reference on Varus.
The splash art is a bit lacking tbh. Maybe the DRX skins have set the bar too high but overall better than the 2023 skins
메가나르 미니나르 둘 다 트로피로 뚝배기 깨는거 디테일 좋네 ㅋㅋ
Yone's Ult should have T1 logo in the middle or something.
Thus looks so bad
this is somewhat similar to Pentakill Viego
It would be crazy if Yone cast his ult a 5 stars will appear between the lines of the ult.
okay guma's recall doesn't have a trophy lol
PYKE SKIN IS TOP 3 AND IT AINT 2 OR 3
It's good👍
bad😂😂
Ah…a little like marauder skin😂…
Nah bro, they cook with these skins
Marauder 2.0
nooooooooooooooo why skin for pyke keria 😢
Hign noon with red vfx
"IZ GOOOD" -Guma eating croissant at worlds 2024
looks like marauder skin imo :(
Yone should be prestige, am I missing something ?
We just need them to win one more for Keira's Lux
feels like a coven skinline really
need more T1's logo on every skins though
Can we all agree that pyke has the best one
2:08  "gumayusi can he steal it?"
im def buying that Gnar and maybe sylas skin
Oner and Gumas recalls are the best
Galio got so robbed.
Amazing linking park skins!❤
페이커 요네 미쳤다
omg that Pyke is goooood!!
Absolute awesome, looks like a custom skin quality
Brutal!
일러랑 귀환모션만 봤을땐 뭔가뭔가였는데 스킬 이펙트가 개쩌네
HELP— THAT GNAR RECALL WAS SO CUTE 😭😭😭
Marauder 2.0
대마왕과 그의 사천왕들
Gnar hitting the trophy on his head like Zeus IRL lol
Xấu
섹스 ㅋㅋ
These looks like custom skins.
finally some skin that rivals ig
i love you rito
Another damn pyke skin
Imagine waiting for almost 1 year and getting Marauder skins XD
Zeus's Gnar recall when he bumped his head on the trophy, Guma's Varus baron steal and the Croissant "its good". finally an awesome skin for T1!!!
holy shit pyke is just so peak wtf
finally they got the right color palette
thanks for winning another time, bois. They're all sooooooooooo stunning
day 1 prestige t1 sylas haver!
I've been waiting for this
Yone is farming aura
Gnar is so stupid :))
Holly SFX,
This is like 2013 but x10 better
Không có Hiệu ứng T1 mấy nhỉ?
Oner recall
how do we know this is t1 sylas without recall?
finally armored skin pyke YEAHHHHHHHHHH
Can guma steal it?

888484 처박고 광탈하는 쵸팔이 시그니쳐챔으로 밀던 사일 요네 다 뺏겨서 ㅂㄷㅂㄷ하겠누? ㅋㅋㅋ 아우솔 스몰더나 평생 해라 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

2023 T1 skin:Soft 2024 T1 skin:So Fxxking Hard!
Edg 크로마 스러운 느낌
Gas
"IT'S GOOD!!!!!!!!" -Gumayusi-2024
Definitely the best Worldsskin
But... The prestige wasnt yone?
인게임이 낫네
zero love on skins
This is a lowkey Darkin x Coven skin.  I LOVE IT!
Coven and High noon skins
wtf  super good skin for t1
Gnar is so cute and omg those varus reference stealing baron and croissant lel
They recreated Zeus getting hit by the crown XD
Oner Vi is the best imo
Man I wish this is a battle pass so I can get that sylas skin
I don’t like how yone doesn’t hold the trophy in the recall
So good
When will they come out in the game?
너무 잘 나왔다! 굿!
Finally Riot is making good use of the red of T1, siiiick
Pyke recall is so peak
ooohhh nice they both gave yone and sylas for faker
I like Zeus recall so much, that bonk😂
와 개멋있다;; 요네 대상혁 쉿포즈 지린다
much better than last year’s
Faker Yone So Awesome
crazy skin
Sylas sick ❤
Basically old god with t1 logo
These are amazing. ❤❤❤
Coven T1 2024 @@
Wow !!! Amazing , feeling best skin ever for T1
Holy shit, these are CLEAAAAAN
They are incredible
This is what I wanted for orianna
why isn't there a single t1 logo  *okay pyke has one
Instantly buying Yone, Varus and Pyke.
드디어
they cooked rlly hard
Prestige on a worlds skinline really
Immediately? Cool
This is so much better than their previous skin
Yone’s skin is fly asf I’ll most definitely be buying that lmao
finally went away from older versions of t1 skins and went with a new cooler look thank god ❤
Skin mas bellaaaa puñetaaaaaaaa❤❤❤ amo este canal por subir estas cosas ❤
This just feels right as T1 the strong red
Honestly sylas is kinda banging
