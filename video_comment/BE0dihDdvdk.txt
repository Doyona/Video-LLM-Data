better turbo s
Ma Twats On Cars....I can't unsee it now.
The alloy wheels always look cool in glossy black colour as the tyre are already in matte black
Lol Mat is like a child. But that ppf made the car look so much better.  Congrats.
Really missed out on that yellow dials
So you haven't gone full Yannimize... Hmmm...😆
But there is one big problem...the steering is on the wrong side😢
Black GTRS3 vinyl is looks better or use same color of rims.  Because all car is contrast with black and silver
I think the yellow gauge cluster and clock face would match à bit better
matts friends wit yanni, so why isn't he doing it???? not much friendship going on I guess.
I was thinking gloss the whole time but matte looks great. Decals make the car. Congrats
cool
seriously, the front plate sticker just ruined the entire car!
The car looks dope🚀🔥 Harry deserves a raise♥️
I love you video mat
could have gone for olive green kinda color instead of that greyish silver(on my prespective and l appreciate your choice of color)
Im glad you went with the matt finish. It looks so good.
Matt git is what I see on that plate lol
So cute when at 24:48 he said "You might've noticed, there is some paper over the front number plate", but it already showed the plate uncovered 5 seconds earlier 😄
Example of how annoying owners can be.
Those yellow stickers are such a poor choice, don't go with the paint color at all. Trust him to ruin a GT3 RS.
The usual garbage
Are you linked to MatArmstrong
Porsche sticker on the back. Now if you forget what you are driving, you can run to the back for a reminder. 🤮
Spoiler alert 19:46 :D
....must be doing allright for your self Mat........why did`ent you go to Carwow for discount, lol
Drive the gt3rs man...stop the look modification...be an enthusiast not the poser
Blue sticker still on brake pedal
Feel for the fella doing the wrap the poor sod got mark in his ear and timing him also the camera man six inches away
Bro was fuckin annoyed to have you in his work space
You work with Yianni on a very regular basis and in the videos at least make out you're like proper bezzie mates etc.  So all in all a bit odd you didn't use his business for the wrapping
SEEMS TOO MUCH TALK ABOUT THIS
y not yiannimize?
...stunning the transformation from dealer to the brilliant modifications... Congratulations!
Shame about the front number plate. Otherwise a beautiful car!
£1900 a month HP. Better go filming 8 hours a day.
The black rims from the other car would look much better then the bronze one. The contrast with the silver paint and black trim would be amazing
Satin was 100% the correct choice.
Matt, silver with gold wheels? Do you buy jewellery off qvc?
Mat is the kind of guy that even PPFes his own teeth
How come yannie didn't do your wrap
How many cars did you buy and sell to get that baby!!
Aaron Ramsdale
You're like a helicopter parent for your car. Its bloody annoying, let the man do his job 🤦‍♂️
Stunning, enjoy it!
the window of my A4 '97 still not vibrating when closing the door...after 450.000km...
Will you give that car to me🥹
W Harry 😂😂
I love this series!
WOW that looks F#*KING AWESOME. What a great spec. Love it. You are a very luck man.
Man leases a shiny car, pays money (probably got it for free) to make it not shiny and gets really excited 🤷
Gloss is what I would have done, nothing like a shiny Porsche.  The gold decals just don’t go with the silver IMHO, gold needs a dark contrast (like the wing), from a distance you can’t see what is there against the silver.  Maybe it looks better in person, however not what I would have done.
https://youtu.be/gs5j5-lBGQw?si=VJv2lHE8obBL2MA4
worse door fit than a prototype tesla 3
Matthew is so happy he's like a child😂😂😂😂
❤❤ niceee
Harry is class, what a legend. He knows his craft! I’d not have done the gold decals though as from afar you just can’t really read what it says? I’d have gone more stealth black 100%. Congrats though Matt! You’re a good chap deserving of this awesome beast.
Material and Color finished is good BUT the combination of yellow devil color is not good "BADUY", try to search this word MATT?
For me, the gold clashes with the silver and the yellow clashes with the gold. But it’s your car. Congrats.
Me no like.Look like pimp or drug dealer car.
Looks brilliant as is
Merry Christmas Mat - - - ive been missing your "off roading"  segments - - - they were just So Funny
Flipped it already??
Rumours you've now sold this car?
I own a 1987 911 carrera convertable Air cool 😎 and a 2019 991.2 GT3RS lizard 🦎 Green 😎😎😎😎
Great result and fine choice of satin & gold.
Amazing comments from non ppf Installers 😂
I will buy my dream car as soon as possible!!❤
Booom 🔥
I guess Mat hasn't made another video in a month because he is just having fun driving this car
is this GEEZER your brother ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BLf8EYc9mY&t=220s
You showed the plate at 11:55 already Matt
OMG. As if it did not look good enough as it was. Nailed it. LOVE it
The most important question is: Will the little blue plastic peel on the break pedal ever be removed?
Its too good mat 😂
Congratulations, Matt. The car looks great.
Matt you speak russian?
MAT SHIT great number plate 😂 😂
SICK CAR MAN WOW STUNNING
Yup that wing smack my blood pressure would have gone through the roof 😂 I don’t think I can deal with owning such a car  I even so much as fart in it I’d be worried about the seat and value
I did a Car Verticical history check. It never even picked up on one of the two plate changes the two owner car had unfortunately, be warned in trusting it too much everyone ! Love the vid Mat
Why not Yianni
Why did you buy such a slow car?   It's a slower car than my Model S😂😂
I hope yianni wasn’t mad you went to someone else to ppm your car instead of him
@MatWatsonCars Do a video about you car collection
in one part of the vedios we saw the number plate lol
Btw Congratulations for the new GT3 RS!!
Not done @Mat Watson Cars u should have done all the ppf work at @Yannimize !!
❤️❤️❤️👏👍💪
Awesome car dude, but there’s probably plenty of poor buggers out there who’ve bought loads of Porsche cars over the years in the hope of getting an allocation for one of these, only to be told thanks but no thanks. How have you managed to get an allocation?
Interesting content. Keep up the good work on your channel. Regards, WR4K.
I actually thought for a moment that Matt was going to jump onto Harry with excitement. It’s the type of excitement that a child has when getting the best Christmas present they’ve ever had. Beautiful car and a brilliant job by Harry. Enjoy it Matt…you deserve it 👌👍😊
Is that number plate legal?
Mat Watson you did a great job too buy that GT RS
@matwatsoncars can you do an update on your gt3rs please?
5:48 slam that door harder. Window is still in one piece 🤛
Yellow hairdresser spec 😂
West brom your lucky it didn't get stripped or donuted on Sandwell Valley park then dumped in the cut there again it wasn't bilston more thieves than winson green k wing 🤣
Car wow doing well obviously 🙄
I found your German brother @Autogefühl
Congrats! Stealth def better vs gloss
Matt, please cooperate with the Russian channel, there is no one like you in Russia,pleeasseeeeee.I love you
Matt, please cooperate with the Russian channel, there is no one like you in Russia,pleeasseeeeee.I love you

Matt, please cooperate with the Russian channel, there is no one like you in Russia,pleeasseeeeee.I love you
Your plate was already reveal throughout the whole video
MAT 911 T
Instead of Porsche sticker on the wing i would made (WIDE ASS) sticker 😏
loved it!
Drive iiiit!!
That looks incredible. When it comes to cleaning it for the first time you should do a collab with Car Cleaning Guru.
Looks incredible
Yes Harry you legend
Rookie error on the plate spacings.... Close up the MAT the standard computer spacing looks pants 😫 M    A   T     VS  MAT. Get it changed 👍
MAT 911T that is your licence plate number
Can you imagine a better Christmas than to pick up a new car? A Porsche GT3 RS for thousands of pounds❤
Estoy cansado de verte
Should have put MATS 911
Mat, this looks so GOOOD!! 🙌
Telling million times if you wanna sell your car through carwow it pays off
Cybertruck review - embargo release tomorrow night ? UK time? Already filmed ?
I’d love to be a pound behind Mat.
Porsche prices are going south at long last.
Interesting to see how good the paint is - compare this to the SF90 that Ammo NYC has just done. Night and day. Porsche QC seems to be head and shoulders above Ferrari
What? Mat supporting another car website.
That car is BEYOND a beauty. No other car can ever beat this… Porsche is the best and best best no other words to say how good it is. I matched the excitement for the reveal. We get our Porsche 911 that’s silver sometime mid dec.! We got a Porsche gift of a toy car and I cannot wait much longer!!!😅
You've made it your own now.
I remember seeing Kahn's Bugatti Veyron with the F1 number plate and even that had orange peal, I couldn't believe it. Donkeys years ago now.
Mat loves spending money 😂
Matt is like a kid at Christmas
Was better before😢
In some years, Car Vertical report : Accidents - Shoulder tap
Completely and utterly mat shiit. Nice motor though
Mat shit? What kind of number plate is that 😂
Why do you always crazy over the top laugh at all jokes?
Hello, it has been 11 days we want to see you driving it
Matt getting the most boring under the radar GT3 RS spec.
The PPF and detailing is exceptional! I'd love to know how much it all cost. Any chance you could share that with us, Mat?
It may be because I'm American and my only knowledge of Birmingham is listening to Jeremy Clarkson make hundreds of wise cracks about it.  But, if I could afford $500k for a limited edition Porsche I might take it to London or the Porsche factory to have the mods done, rather than Birmingham.
Beautiful car. I wouldn't dare drive it in the real world!
Great stuff.  How come you didn't have Yanni do this for you?  😀😁
So Happy for you Mat!
I can only see TIT on the reg plate 😜 only mad jealous, she’s a beauty!
Just needs some furry dice to finish it.
Congrats the that gold sticker makes the car pop
Incredible car and job but the decals are too cheesy for me.
Not at Yanimaize? Long time no videos with you. Everything is fine?
The old decals looked better, anyone else think the same?
The porsche logo on the spoiler looks AWESOME!!
and peaple says money doesn’t buy happiness
cover it in rexy livery
never knewit can be that clean :o, personal plate so cheap, in my country its is 1000euros, cheaper 450 with just own combinations with number and letter
hey Mat, MA T...for your licence plate - the letter A and letter T's kerning (space between two letter need to be adjust to make it closer), have a chance to make a new one to make the car perfect!
I actually don't think the design of the front works well. It's not good looking in the way that earlier RS cars are. Not your fault, but Porsche! congrats on the purchase.
Looks great, but I'd of matched the stripe better to the wheels and gone mat on the carbon too
You did a video about gt4 rs and that is the same colour as this and i thought this is gt4 rs too but yeahhh... And its nope 💀
Go Mr. Miggiity Matt.... I was so like "huuuuuh.?." when you were over at Porsche custom designing the colors etc... but hey it's you're Porsche brah... Nice nice sir
can make millions to buy that car and cant figure out that hes dealing with a sticker and peel it, maybe right before he got a hint of it, maybe
I was waiting for, I’m Mat Watson & you’re watching Carwow. 😂😂😂
As a PPF installer myself I love the choice for the stealth xpel! It enhances the aggressive lines of the car even more! Congrats Matt!
Carvertical sponsoring every car video on YouTube 😂
Please warm up your tires as well😈
Damn you leaked plates🤦🏿‍♂️ 19:46 😅😅😅
you betrayed Yan because he also does ppf
i cant believe you didn't take it to yiannimize for the wrapping and protection :(
I am happy for you. your Porsche looks incredible.
Love the car but don’t like those Gold wheels 😬
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Are the stickers not clear coated over?
Beautiful car Matt, love the color, the spec and the decals. These guys do awesome work.
Just fucking drive it!
Want to see it track thrashed please!, let's see some action 🎬
Please wrap it a bright colour would look soooo much better !!
Now looks like a proper wanker mobile.Crashed into halfords🎉
Love it.  You sir are THE most enthusiastic person on YT🎉
The red wheels would have looked perfect with the silver
Congrats 🎉🎊
23:38 Spoiler alert, plate reavealed before revealed😀
This is just perfect Mat, love it wow.
Generally I'm not a fan of matt looking finishes on cars, but I have to admit that satin does look good for silver. I've never really understood the obsession with minimising number plates though, I just don't see normal plates as unattractive in any way. I mean they're on literally every car in the UK, so to my eye it just looks normal. In fact I think non standard or non existant front plates just look weird on a road car, I actually think the car would look better with a standard plate (that front plate looks dubious from a legal standpoint - there's minimum letter sizes and specified fonts for number plates in the UK https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62554c78d3bf7f600782fd4f/inf104-vehicle-registration-numbers-and-number-plates.pdf ).
gimme some wallpapers of your car! I badly want em!
Mat is a big kid😄😄❤ living his dream life. Happy for him🤣♥
Yer man, Harry was amazing...
Hurray 🎉 Finally we can see Matt racing with another supercar in his carwow channel😂😂😂
GOOD MORNING BEAST MAT WATSON CAR CANADA ONTARIO YOUTUBE VIDEO MISSISSAUGA TRANSIT 🇨🇦🇨🇦🍂🍂🍁🍁🍁
There are 2 types of people: 1.porsche 2.por-sche
Men who have no fashion taste speccing cars is just awful.😂
Such a nice car but the colour is so so boring
Watching you struggle with the PPF, tends to make me believe you have never worked with your hands. Just sayin
First quick glance at that number plate and I saw “MAT SHIT”
That silver is bloody amazing!!!  But I'm not a fan of yellow and gold - it would be black and red or blue.  But it's sweet Mat!  🏁🏁🏁🏁
Ohh yeah 😁 lovely mate Go Harry go.
Interesting watching a detailing shop when you work at one yourself
Perfect for me I will do exactly the same! Congrats!
Gloss 100%!
I love how PPF videos don’t show the installers using blades as they all do.
The plate with 315 that he showed can mean that he bought bmw but idk 🤷‍♂️
My little precious ❤😂😮😅
Stunning! :) now off to the Nürburgring ! 😂
Spoiler @19:45😅
19:16 we already see the license plate 😜
This was way funnier than I was expecting!!! 😂
Each to their own but that looks chavvy AF. Porsche on the wing.. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sheeehs, am I the only one who gets commercials every 2 minutes??
Satin look’s way good
don’t want to rain in your parade cause spec and satin finish look awesome and that type of car is wayyyyyy out of reach for me, so don’t get me wrong. But what bugs me is that the gold decals are colorwise off to the rims. colors not really matching. that gold of the decals is too warm/yellowish. https://youtu.be/BE0dihDdvdk?t=1157 If going that extra-mile, the decals should match the rims.
Mat I’m so jealous in a good way. Jealous not envious the car looks fab You’re such a likeable character for me gone from mildly irritating till I caught up with your style of delivery  Enjoy it DRIVE IT!! I’m the only Porsche owner I know who actually puts the miles on a car.
Matt I would recommend getting the frunk lined with some sort of PPF protection - the amount of times something inadvertently goes in and scratches when it moves around whilst driving was unbelievable when I got my Cayman.
I'm Mat Watson, let me show off my vanity
I wonder why Matt didn't choose Yiannimize as his detailing service provider.
Hey Matt you still have the Blue protection PDI tape on the upper right corner of your brake pedal. 17:32
Why didn’t you go to yianni
That's absolutely gorgeous, Mat. If there's one thing I hate it's overly done and garish styling, but everything on your Porsche is spot on.
In the delivery spec I thought it was a little boring but now it looks fantastic! We’ll done
you slid in one shot where the no. plate is visible Mat
fecking tets!
Lotus just cannot get a break. All new car and there target customer still wants something else.
Nobody is gonna even look at that. You re just super busy with stupid stuffs.
PPF is fantastic, however some of them asking for it 5-6K gbp! It’s a joke
I've done protection films outside but I don't recommend inside film job.
How come you never went to Yanni??
Mark he’s definitely taller and wider than you am talking about the car. 😂😂😂
Would look sick with yellow dials
You didn't get Yanni to wrap it he won't be happy also you shown us the reg plate at 19:16 😂
Plate looks like MAT SHIT
I know you're doing this for an advert for this company but for future reference there is an alternative way of wrapping car paint  using a spray on clear wrap which is cheaper and won't lift over time.  They are called Ngenco
Beautiful car!!! Nothing compares!!! Awesome spec!
Take off the blue tape from the brake pedal please
I know you are excited and I am really very happy for you. But - the colour combination is not the best. When you do silver and black, gold/yellow simply looks out of context. Silver is the contrasting to the black. So anything else is excessive. The decals are really awesome but again - you could have gone with black, not yellow. Enjoy your new ride!
Looks really cool. Was hoping you wouldn't go for white which you didn't.
Jesus what a difference, the wing is a piece of art well done Mat!
Sell it! Watch JayEmm!
Are you not going to Topaz detailers anymore?
As a graphic designer, the Kerning between the AT on your plate is messing with my OCD! Fab spec motor
Whats happening in Matts eyes
How many bloody ads can you put in a video..! Goddayumn son 🤔
betrayed yianni 😢
You‘ve forgot the Most Important thing. Changing the Steering Wheel to the left sight 😊 Greetings from Germany
Doesn't Yanni provide this service? 🤔
18:15 unveil
Look fantastic. Car Wow!
Car looks insane with those tweaks.
Have to say, I cant abide that silly thing on the boot- still if your adding go faster stripes maybe it will suit.
I remember when he ragged on the seat Leon for having a bland black interior. That porche is the is the same lol
Congrats, absolutely awesome car!
19:45 Reg reveal
nice license plate, how many you paying in GB?
I think depending on car i do think if your going to ppf a car make it look better aswel and matt definitely did that it looks awesome i for sure would of went the same if i had that car, not something i could do to my FRS but that porsche looks way better for it 👍🏾💯🔥
im in for this car, but those gold wheels are the problem
Bro it looks good in satin it looks like a metal of a gun
I laughed when the number plate was accidentally revealed very early ha
I prefer Chris Harris’ style: Drive it like a madman and don’t bother how it shines or not.
That was so boring 😴
Still hasn't driven it
love the car
Damn this gt3RS just pure 🔥 😍
LOVE the spec bro!                     Noice.
Looks like a Hyundai lol
Lucky you. This test one for some reason looks like a TT, lol. I'll clean yours forever for free.
Next Video: I Crashed My GT3 RS While Uninsured! 😱
Jeez that way he slammed the door ouch
Absolutely love the color, classic as hell and it just brings out the shape of the car bery nice, love the silver !!!!
silver looks great!
BAD ASSS!!!
At first I was like oh no but yeah not bad all ties in,   but disappointed in the too small illegal plate :(  but I guess you can afford the possible fines
Fabulous 👏👏👏
Spending $20k to replace the brakes will be brutal later. But damn, you will have tons of track fun till then.
I always thought that silver/carbon with yellow accents is the way to go BUT silver matte/carbon with yellow accents... i would sell my soul.
Matt you are living the dream bud. I am very happy for you. Looks Matte. Is it smooth as gloss?
Stunning 😍
You gave away the surprise of the number plate by revealing it before you did the formal unveiling. Someone must have pointed this out already but I am not reading 1300+ comments.
gold decals are perfect if only you could have gold decal on the rev counter and not yellow
been Watching you for 4 years now, from Reviewing small cars like the Suzuki Swift to A big Luxury Car like a Maybach, from a Range Rover Sports to an Audi Q7, I have watched it all, and the most excited I have ever seen you is when you Saw the Car after the PPF had been done.  that was pure joy you Showed us, and it felt great watching my Favorite Car Reviewer getting his Dream car.   Lots of Love and Lots of Respect to you Matt.
That looks soooooo much better than if it were gloss … RIGHT choice Mr W
Baba
23:39 😂the plate number was revealed
MAT 911T was revealed before you showed it 😂
Come on Mat, why you don't go to Yianni al Yiannimize?!  😂 btw the spec is 🔥 marvelous ✨️ 🤩
Matt’s childlike excitement is so wholesome, I’m so happy for you.
Mat, what an amazing job they have done to your car. Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without your help. Inside and out it is the Mutts Nuts.
I'm looking forward to you actually taking it home and driving it, then doing a review.
Should have PPF'd the windshield as well ⚠️
Mat,do you hire? 😬
making the car even worse
Why  do you want our money/investment when you already have too much yourself???
Mat. Are you going to drive this thing in the manner it’s being designed to?!?
I love the Rolex Dial on the Smartwatch
The spacing on the number plate is a bit iffy! 🤔
After all the years he did not go to Yanimze for warping!
Might as well wrap the Michelin tires. Blimey! All this shows he wants to sell the car at some point for max profits. Well done to all flippers!
Maybe Mat should put himself fully in a giant PPF bubble so that he can not damage anything of the interior with his hands or feet ;)
I would have expected you to go to Yianni for the PPF
You're cheating on Yianni Matt😂
Saw the number plate half way through 😉
sick fkin spec in the end. satin all day
Bro i hate you i thought you are going to change the whole car
Nice 👌
You're chavving the car up, just drive it like its meant to be driven, please.
Satin is just so sexy
come on !  you always wreck all the car you have been driving!  Don't be that picky!  Anyways, it is a porsche gt3 rs.  It is a racing machine you got!  You probably do drive on track soon!
Interesting that it's legal to use a sticker for a number plate in the UK.   Well done on the car.  Is it me or are the RS stickers on the wing and the GT3 RS on the back bumper very thick?  It looks like there's a raised edge there that might be problematic down the road.
18:36  bruuuuuuuh
Still prefer my 911 turbo S it’s more understated
Bought so many cars but ask for funding? Reminds me of crypto king sam bankman fried😂
Maaat, you've gone and leaked the reg in the b-roll just before the reveal man! How've you done that???
19:46 ruined the number plate reveal 😂
Love the car, Mat and the detailing - a spectacular choice.  Hate the front number "plate" sticker.  Truly a hideous mistake... in my opinion. Have fun driving it though - I'm sure you will.
Wow!well done!😮
Is Greg using a camcorder? Interesting.
How do they create all of the templates? Would be interesting to know…
I'm not about to watch another man enjoy a very expensive car while I'm sitting here with nothing. You people are absolutely losers watching other men's success.
The number plate isn’t BS marked so is technically illegal, font looks too small too but I don’t blame you for fitting
Why??? 😮
🚮 GT3 touring is better looking than this kaak🤮🚮
Duuuude. Looks epic. I love the  matt with the gloss bonnet. 💥💯
Matt, are you a millionaire? 🤔😂
carwow以外にこちらのチャンネルでも日本語字幕をお願いしたいです。
The satin ppf elevates the car dramatically!!
If it is your fucking car and you make such a fuzz about it, maybe you should take some time to pronounce it correctly. That would be a worthy thing, would it not?
IT IS NOT PORSH!!! The name is Porsche. Even you Brits can get it right. Harry Metcalf does.
I'd rather a c8 zo6 an save 100k +
750k views with only 800 like, how does that even happen, give this man the respect he deserves
That little piece of blue tape still left on the pedal was annoying me during the reveal video. When I saw it was still there I threw up a little in my mouth.
That fuking ugly car paint not deserve 300k euros Lol if was mine i return it and ask for a another one weacsssss
Thats one hot car need a back seat so I can terrify the wife and kids lol.
Bruh! Your editor should get half of his/her salary for this particular video edit cz he/she forgot to cut the scene of 19:46 where we can see your number plate (MAT 911T)😂 Sorry for your loss blud😂
You should have went to Yianni, he's your mate I'm sure.
S⚡️✨y 🔥
Matt, don’t you know half of your fans are going to be mad you didn’t get a Tesla 🙄
I had this drive past me a few weeks ago, I thought the plate MUST have been your new car. Congrats 🎉 looks amazing
Does anyone know how much something like this costs?
Вот это дотошность!
Dont like the gold decals 🫢
What is orange peel?
Matte film tends to get old really fast, the car never really looks clean or dirty, he will get sick of it in 3 months 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️… and on a silver too. Not many colors can pull it off with matte, perhaps the green hell amg gtr or a Matt black lp700
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 screw porsche right now
Magnificent. Well done
Yianni wont be happy 😊
24:19 i actually saw this before at 19:45  😅
Mat... I do love you, and what you do... But I just get the feeling you didn't quite think that number plate through...? 🤣  I have a personalised plate myself, and getting it right is tough... Numbers can be used as letters, etc... I have a variation of Tigger on mine using letters and numbers to make the word... And I see what you were going for - Mat's Porsche 911 and all that...   But all i could read from the first time I saw it was Mat Giit...! Or more accurately MAT gIIT... And it's a shame as I don't think you're a git! 😜  But all joking aside, I love your car, I think you deserve it for all your hard work over the years, and I truly hope you have fun and enjoy it. It's Gorgeous!  All the best,   Tigger
Crazy changes 😂
Why you didnt drive it yet?
I think the gloss looked much better
Stunning car to begin with Matt. The mod's and PPF  just make it jump out at you.
insulting arrogant , obnoxious , yea hes a britt awright
Car looks amazing.  License plate looks like you took it off a Carrera T though.
Yellow is so much better for the dials once you see it
I hope they've improved since my 911 went there, they couldn't install the wing mirror film, and it had to be sent to Topaz to finish it off.......  Where I've been a customer since.
Mat911t was shown half way through the blog ... lol..
I have to say I was a bit disappointed when you revealed your new 911.The kinda bland look you went for,  Mat.  The gold wheels with lime green body, yellow callipers, dials and stitching was my pick. Followed by red wheels, white body and red stitching and dials. I'd want everyone to see me coming from a mile away in this kind of car. Porsche cars are relatively conservative out of the box. The replacement decals do improve the look giving it a much needed lift.  I guess when you're blowing this sort of money it's easy to want to play it safe and call it 'classic'. I'm going to go and order my one now.
wing ends do not look better in silver lol
Congratulations it looks spectacular and you’ve earned it.
❤ congrats...
Spoiler alert, oops too late!
That is a serious bit of kit ! Monster of a car.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why you made it Satin?? it should have been Gloss! so disappointed ☹
The piece of blue tape on the brake pedal KILLS me in each video 😂
THRUSH
I'm happy for you mate. very nice car. you made the right decision about the stealt ppf
Thats not Harry thats Ramsdale😂
Let’s find out what could go wrong because I’m Mat Watson and you watching MY CARS🔥
Get the Dundon valved titanium exhaust system with headers. Or smuggle the Crack pipe in and fit that for some serious non eu recommended decibels 🎉😂
Matt looks like morty
You showed the number plate in a cut away at 19.52 btw 😅
Looks like the Brother from jeremys clarkons boy 😂😂😂
A car worth around 200k and Mat is still pissing around with it making everyone laugh. True legend 🙌 😂
Bro added 20k of value to the car
Why get a beautiful spec and then get it covered with a new one?
Covers the number plate but revealed it without noticing in the video 🤣🤣 come on Matt you got too excited wanted to show everyone haha love it
I wonder how much commission is made for all these recommendations
On that color i think I'd go with the satin
Matt didnt go to Yiannimize 😱
What could possibly go wrong? Mats shoulder 😂😂😂
This Looks Soo Amazing ❤️💥 Great Car ❤️ Happy For You Mat ✨
00:39 🤣 rewatched this 10 times
Where did you get that hoodie. I've been online and they won't accept a UK address
Matt, your face exposed too much of sun, you're getting older much faster than non exposed.. Please frequently wear sunscreen all the time, your face is important :D
gotta be one of the coolest Porches I've seen
Great video, how ever when you did a cut scene whilst showing off the Mat PPF and decals the REG was shown before you revealed it 😅
This car is gorgeous in any color, but man silver is just a boring color
Looks fantastic. Any idea the cost to To PPF the Centre Console? I have a mobility car so don't need a Bill at the end of the lease to replace the Mat Black Trim??
Looks amazing Matt. Why do you call the front fender a wing? Is that a British thing?
The truth about carwow went obvious after they started to begin for money from random people for the second time now. The truth about Mat is also obvious,  because he knows about the terrible condition of the company, but anyway smiles and acts like there is nothing to bother.
Such a beautiful spec!
The GT3 RS is looking perfect!! Congratulations, Mat!!
Show me you driving dude!!!
The car looks bloomin brilliant...now come on matt let us see you drive it now..we can't wait
Please don’t use strap lines that suggest the video is about something it’s not. The main reason I watch your videos is that they appear honest. Using misleading titles for the videos will make me stop watching you. 😢
Just don’t change the colour to racing green with tan leather seats Matt 🤢
I hope Matt makes a video of him and Yanni showing each other their new sports cars.
He's like a Kid, that will be gone in couple of months, no can use..........LOL>
1 question. Yanni's company does not do this sort of thing? Why do you choose them over Yanni?
I dont wanna be like Matt when i grow up so critical about everything. Like he has odd
One complaint... The number plate was revealed in a shot before the actual reveal 😖😂
It's gonna be real heartache to park anywhere... Good luck in having good nite sleeps... Cheers....
I wonder how much time Mat spends just staring at his car. I would sleep next to it.
Always fun to watch professionals doing their job.
love it love love it Matt! Made it yours with the extra decals and ppf, where did your guy get the number plate stickers?
Maybe a pearl pink would look better.
That’s the spec ive seen on a gt3rs
Sell it and buy a better car
I have P66NUS on retention hahahah
I THINK MAT HAS PASSED HE CAN BE A PROFESSIONAL PPF WRAPPER NOW LOL WELL DONE MAT
Harry is a gem.
Matt your better than these click bait titles
Wow, looks amazing.
Love the satin; looks great. Other changes... sorry a little bit tacky to my eyes, and is it just me but the gold doesn't match the wheels? Seems a bit dark. Props for making it different though, it's certainly unique.
@yiannimize is crying now for using a different wrapping company :(
Bring it to Carwow❤❤❤
Matt well done for convincing your mate to use car vertical on his bmw he was thinking of buying,  because not being funny but not many if any car repair shops would ever put a car directly on the ground without and wheels on and not jacked up on jacks or on a lft.😂😂
I don't like it, but happy for him.
😂,, it all ready went wrong,, oww..nice one.😂
It looks fantastic Matt👍🔥
Personally don’t like the gold decals on the side, but elsewhere they look good, stunning in stealth ppf though
Plates belong in the kitchen not on cars🤧
Always use protection.
the gold decals blends in too much with the silver. Needs a dark outline for it to stand out.
Great work from Harry and really happy for Mat in getting his dream 911! Wishing you many happy thrilling miles and adventures in your wonderful Porsche Mat
1 fender ppf and 1 screen protector wasted by matt
Nooo Mat you did not do that off camera🤣🤣🤣🤣
Car looks awesome
Have you finally removed that final bit of blue tape on the pedals? It’s giving me nightmares, you left it on in your handover video and it’s still there now
Holy shit that's good
A clever way to advertise sponsors is break it up throughout the video into segments so you can't just skip it in one. I just skip them and I'm sure everyone else does.
The mat finish was the correct call, looks awesome, but not so sure about the gold decals. I don't know if it just on the video but there isn't much contrast with the paint which is a shame imo
And here i am , driving a golf ...
Hope you don't get stopped by police for that size of front plate. I had same on Impreza Spec C. They stopped me and I had to get a full size one fitted and shown to them
Never noticed how cross-eyed Matt actually is but this video exposes him bad😂
Best looking one I’ve seen so far 😮
"I want, I want..." change your language Matt, you are sounding obnoxious and rude..." I would like..."
How long until he realises the number plate reads "Mat Git"
So wholesome how Mat hugs Harry :))))
Nailed it!
Here in the United States Porsche dealer told me to not PPF headlights since it causes them to delaminate.  Dealer was told by Porsche North America.
That’s your warranty gone………….😬
I wonder why you didn't do it at Yanni's
bro still didn't peel of the tiny piece of plastic on the pedals
What, no Yiannimise? 😂😂😂
23:39 number plate seen. Then next it’s covered again.
I like the MAT 911T Plate
Matt looks like a manlet next to Harry
Yeah, I would be driving it far by now. Life is short.
Love the silver side endplates on the spoiler with the gold RS. Stunning
I heard you have to tell your insurance if you wrap a car, is that true?
My OCD really can't handle that bit of blue tape that is still sitting on the brake pedal (already bothered me on the reveal video) :p
Too many ads on YouTube nowadays spoiling the enjoyment, stopped watching half way through,
Very good choice on the satin finish ! Have the alcantara seats also been coated? Cheers
Imagine having to much money 😮
Sorry Mat but that wing is awful, it's just a massive cock extension!
Not a fan of the gold, not with silver anyway. Sorry.
PPF is only worth it on collectible cars like this. If you're buying a normal/civilian car, PPF does NOT add to the value of the car when you resell. If someone is looking to buy a USED normal/civilian car, last thing they care about is how much you spent on protecting the paint.
STOP THE PATHETIC FAYK LAUGH
@yianni mice
Looks gorgeous Matt!!!Congrats!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
My ocd in me is hurting that the decals are gold and don’t match the bronze wheels.
I do not understand the colors on this spec.  Sorry.
Where  is  youtube  😅
Really hope no-one damages it out of spite.
Is your best mate yani pissed off you didn't go to him for the wrap
GT silver all the way
19:46 you accidentally spoiled the number plate reveal.....😅 Hey ya Mat.... Big Fan.... Go and enjoy the H out of it... willing to see ya on drag races with da beast......👊
My jaw actually dropped when I saw the rear wing. Good choice!
When are you drag racing it ?
Mat, this looks 1000% better than when your car was first delivered...well done mate!
Matt, U forgot to PPF the adorable magnetic paddle shift 🫠.!..
I'm surprised you didn't go to Yianni to have it done
I PPF wrapped every surface of my Turbo GT, not cheap, but best decision ever, considering modern paints are about as hardy as chalk.
Gold decals are horrendous
Fuk I was hoping you went with the frosted silver, looks awesome.
Very tasteful Matt. Fantastic 👍
Looked good to start with, looks even better now. Great job!
Please take off the blue bit stuck on the brake pedal
Awesome Matt. The gold side decal could have matched the colour of the wheels LOL! and sorry personalised plates are w4nk3y
Nicely done Matt 👌.  Double thumbs up👍👍
Car looks amazing and what incredible skill from the wrap team. 👏
That is absolutely stunning Matt!
Dude PPF is an art form.  It’s very difficult to do. Love your car.
i also got ppf. i havent,however, money to buy a car. but u ought to start somewhere innit
what is wrong with mat´s eyes? Does someone know? Just wondering..
The steering wheel is on the wrong side
This car is absolutely gorgeous
£45,000 for 911 BEN 😮
Why haven’t you done this in yiannimize shop
Yanee : am I a joke to u
18:50 Mat says we got the number plate covered 19:14 just shows the plate
Great car though the number plate kerning really is awful.
Harry is 100% related to Kaleb from Clarkson's Farm.
Wow. Didn’t let Yanni wrap it? Ouch.
MAT SHIT LOL
Satin 100%. I guessed it. Looks WOW
Bro it’s rental not your car
Poor Yianni you cheated on him
Looks way better than factory. Very Nice.....one might even say "Car Wow"
I don't know if you've seen this Mr Watson, but you actually reveal the number plate @19:45 Bloody nice car and what a job the lads have done for you, nice work. I know where I'll be taking my GT3RS when I get one :)
I’m wondering why he didn’t go to yanni
Bro that spoiler is solid 😂😂😂
Those yellow stickers ruin it
nice video
AMAZING result. Such a unique finish. Great job
jesus christ the end result is SPECTACULAR
I don't know the right words . I am truly glad that you get  "THE PERFECT 911 GT3 RS" . The PPF wrapping and the addition of decorative gold badges (on the wing)  PORSCHE and RS on both side . It is truly wonderful . Enjoy, you deserve it .
This is endlessly more entertaining than the stupid drag races you film on your main channel
Satin is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Arguably the sexiest 911 I’ve ever seen
Matt  that looks bloody amazing mate. And that rear wing with the gold Porsche lettering.  Definitely the right choice especially with the gold decals.  Well done Onex .Matt dont prang it up 👍
I am waiting for delivery of my own RS. Where did you get your front number plate and what size is it?
Looks so good in satin… happy for you Mat!
Grey, black, white, silver.... boring.
Don’t cheat on Yianni Mat lol.
You also could have gotten it alil more exp3if you didn't get the gt3 rs  on the side!
What you do when you buy your first expense car.... Hahaha I remember when I got my first expensive car.
Wonderful spec, Mat. Love the GT3RS and absolutely love your excitement for it. So well deserved, I hope you have a great time with it. xx
Plate reveal at 19m16secs oops.
That satin makes the car look even better against those wheels, spot on Matt!
Why, when removing ppf from new paint, will the paint peel off but not factory paint?
Now floor it finally
Thanks for the nice video
Matt, are you cheating on Yanni? You do know your boy does wraps for a living 🤔😏 does Yanni know about this?
OH,,,,,,MY,,,,,,,GOD,, this is painful to watch,,,,,Mr. Lewis!
It's so nice you guys can have front stickers in lieu of a plate. In most states in the US, we are required to have the unnecessarily large, ugly plates that ruin the front ends on pretty much every modern car. I'm all for a car's registration being visible from the front and back in case of an accident, but the way we go about it is idiotic and outdated.
Not another PPF-focused video on YouTube with more laughs than this. Great job Matt and enjoy my dream car
A smudge less caffeine probably wouldn’t be a bad idea!
Matt has low IQ
why is matt orange 🤣 probbably some Brittish carrots
Incredible Mat!
Satin
Stealth or satin PPF will transform your vehicle.  I got the full xpel stealth wrap and  ceramic coating on my vehicle 2 years ago….still in love.
plate looks like "Mat Shit"
I am a bit surprised, that he didn't get it wrapped by yiannimize
Satin was definitely the choice
Looks lot bettwr in satin ❤
PPF guys freaking out over Porsche lights delaminating after PPF is applied
Sagging headliner????!!
Dumbest thing you can do is say what plate you want online. Don’t do that mat.
crazy sexy, i wouldve left off the gold decals on the side but besides that is the perfect spec. 100% would choose the same one if could
I love the car it's a great gorgeous car but I have to say I'm not enthralled by the coloure... the white one looked so good. 🔥  but the gt3 is is a beautiful car ❤
looks similar to my micra
MAT911T is a cracking plate to match that.
"I've changed my GT3" Why? Because every youtuber on the planet has one and their content is BORING
Absolutely the most sexy GT3 RS I have seen yet!!
Mat, how old are you?
Great video 👍🏻👍🏻 But Plleaaaaassssss remove da last piece of the blue foil from the paddles 🥲
carfax or vertical check or whatever these shady services will give different reports to buyers and sellers. So, a story, once someone was looking for a car, bought it used from a dealer, dealer printed out carfax reports with "clean" history, then in about a year, that someone sells a car to another dealer, that dealer prints out carfax report, and what do you know, the car has been in an tree-collision accident before prior buy, was totaled and restored. Moral, carfaxes fix reports to look good for dealers to sell, then, after a delay, add missing entries to report.  P.S. Mat, please make sure this "car vertical check" is a reputed business before advertising them.
Should’ve ceramic coated it
Why your face yellow
sheesh
Whats the price for ALL that work? Probably another cars price :D
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 simple modifications made it even looks better
You could rap the tyres with ppf 😂
50k for a plate................. WHAT THE FUQ..................
Pls help me car wow buy this Mat RS3 GT for me ❤
Gt3 RS needs to be a striking colour… I would go with yellow!
Congrats Matt!
Surprised Yianni didn’t do the PPF for Mat😂
❤️❤️
I'm pretty sure the vote was for Python Green
When can we get this in Gran Turismo 7 as a style we can use on the '22 GT3RS?
0:40 that crazy science professor look gets me every time 😂😂❤
Whats better , Porsche 911 gt3 rs or amg gt ?
Fantastic car fantastic spec fantastic video.
The Matt finish looks 100x better!
What could possibly go wrong "knocks shoulder on spoiler " 😅 😂
That blue tape on the peddle...you still didn't remove 😕
I have a 20 year old 206.. hahahaha
Illegal plate, 120 quid fine, 3 points.  You got 4 lives.  good luck.
Its virginity status has also changed
I want one
Drive it
Next car should be the Warren Owen W12 Mulsanne... 😊😮Suits you
Please don't drive it Mat😂😂😂😂😂
MAT GIIT? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Seriously it looks awesome
Does Matt have issues with his vision? They way holds his head and the slight eye deviation?
Let Yianni do the PPF.😅
WOW Matt this looks incredible wouldnt want to drive it around West Bromwich or Walsall hope youve got a good aftermarket alarm fitted ?
That giant Porsche logo on the spoiler is awful - tacky as fuck and ruins the car from behind completely.
.... you should give it to Yanni for ppf
Think it looked better without stickers.
satin wow it looks ssoo sickkkk😮
Wtf dude you didn’t go to Yanni 😭😭 cmon we need more of him on the channel!!!
The number plate surprise was spoiled @19:14 when it reveals the MAT911T 😂
wow that silver mat look is super amazing  love it . congrats
911 comments lol
Looks much better than before.  Painting spoiler wings was the right call also.
PPF is an incredible thing and well worth it for peace of mind from stone chips and worse..!  I am a PPF installer (as well as detailer) . Its a very satisfying job (and at times frustrating one!)   People spend £50 on a case and screen protector for a £800 phone but seem to not want to spend an equal proportion on a car - when there are all manner of downsides if you don't.   Resprays are often poor quality, the PPF protects your original finish and for many people keeping the factory paint job is a very valuable thing. It also makes it much easier to clean and even offers protection from vandalism...!  So it's very much recommended in my book. Although I typically recommend only doing track pack,  on most cars, full car coverage on cars to this value makes complete sense.   Another benefit of PPF is that it covers and hides swirl marks completely.  😎
Stealth looks amazing, but not a fan of the decals
No yannimize?!
first world problems
11 minutes for the hardest panel… and they charge how much? 💀
Absolutely stunning lad , enjoy 👍👍
It would be interesting to see whether it is possible to change the plastic parts and replace them with real carbon parts for your Gt3 RS  like SSR performance offers for the Gt2 RS
U lucky duck, looks wild
Can’t believe you didn’t go to your mate  yannie for this ?
You lot don't know what it is to have money....just throw money away..shame on you
“This is very curved very angular extremely difficult to fit a GT3RS” , camera points at the car which is just big slightly curved panels and you have a cutter man 🤣
joyy!!  dark bronze wheels would be killer.. not to keen on the gold
Holy fuck. Looks a few times better. This is my fucking dream right here. Congrats Matt! So happy for you and I definitely felt that joy when you were jumping around after the reveal.
Wowwee! Absolutely amazing. Think the gold graphics would have looked better with a black stroke though 👌🏼
wow!! love it!!
I always regret not getting my RS6 in the satin grey but it just added so much time to my order which still took 12 months. Ended up going with Sebring Black which looks great for the 7 seconds its clean.
The gloss carbon on the satin paint looks unbelievable
Wait how much did you pay for the number plate
First time I actually love Mat’s spec and mods. Happy for him. What a car!
Great video. Awesome car. I hope the yellow sticker on the side looks better irl. In the video you cant even see what the sticker says. Much prefered the old sticker.  It almost seems like the caliper, wheels and stickers are three different types of yellow..
@14:20 "Just remember, you have two buttholes Matt."  ... Matt: "Two buttholes?" .... You guys really need to start pronouncing that word better. :)
Matt has got more money than time. seriously geezer, just drive the thing, we want to see it in action, stop playing with your food.
Congratulations it's exactly what I would pick awesome card to try the daily wonderful sound
I love everything and good thought to protect the car with PPF. However, there is one thing I do not like in cars. Sideskirts and door decals. I would prefer the side of the car to be plain and simple.
Hey Mat  How come you didn’t wrap your car with yianni ?! 😅
Thought the number plate has to have the specs and whoever made it shown on the plate itself.
I'm a Japanese auto fan before anything else, but when it comes to Europeans cars, I only like Porsche and some of the classic/older BMW cars that also were used for racing.
Why cover the plate to show it anyway??????
You got one just in time for the value to crash on them 😂
Satin looks way better!
The car might never be driven to its full potential, but BOY! does it look good not doing so.
That’s taken that up a notch. 🤯 Stunning, one of the nicest specs I’ve seen.
Looks absolutely amazing! ❤
The guy buys a cars, makes a video about it and that video pays for the car, I mean thats a pretty sweet deal
Yeah, that looks insane!
My question is why isn’t he doing it at yiannimize?
Surprised it came on P Zeros. I thought all GT cars came on cup 2s?
The satin was the right choice. Looks great!
Regtransfers is an absolute rip off… buy direct from the dvla and avoid the transfer fee they charge .
Coorr 🤤this car made me rock hard 😅
This is what genuine happiness looks like.... 18:32
I wonder what it says if you take the 91 out of matts private plate.....
Matt said he was gonna buy a Century. Is it finally coming??
the left air intake is missing something
Выглядит просто супер!
Since I watched the carwow gr3 rs video, I have been waiting to see what Mat is doing with it... very keen on following this series....
Lol when you started the satin wrap... brutal honesty. I have no idea what I'm doing. Props to you for being so involved. Love it!
So glad you went with a matte finish, it looks absolutely amazing!
Matt git can’t unsee it
911 turbo s
Siiiiick 🔥🔥
The GT3RS looks awesome in satin PPF. However, as someone from outside the UK, did anyone else gasp at the prices of custom plates?! I get the custom aspect but ain't no way in hell I could ever justify that kind of money on that.
Love the additions to the car Matt. Would've been ever cooler if the RS sticker on the end plates had the Union Jack Flag similar to the Heritage option offered to VIP customers (green accent ones). Never the less, can't get enough of this!
Shame Matt couldn't get a legal number plate
Looking at how Happy Matt is. He is just like a small kid who received his Christmas toys. But I’m proud for him at the same time as he had worked hard to get this reward. Well done Matt
How come Yianni didn’t get the ppf work?
Looks insane
Matte was the way to go.
23:38 bad editing!! He revealed the reg and then at 24:10 he done the actual reg reveal. Imagine Matt organising a gender reveal!!
Thought this car was going to end up at Topaz for some reason 😂
Wrap it Race yellow
That looks stunning, congrats fella. Hard work paying off 👌👌
drive da car already
Stunning
Sell before the market crashes
Looks great Mat, enjoying your enthusiasm at seeing it
such an awesome car
£300,000 car.... £10 suncream   take your pick
Why would you choose a right hand drive? I know you're live i the UK, but the price will be significantly lower than a left hand drive in a few years, won't it?
Is this the same Mat Watson who posted a video yesterday asking us to raise millions for CarWow.
Aaron Ramsdale wraps cars?
Me at the start: "There is nothing that could possibly make this car more beautiful"  Me at the end: "I was once again proven wrong, this is beyond amazing"
Have to be honest, I wasn’t super keen on it but those decals took it to another level.
That satin finish! ❤ Great end result!
I wont Mat Watson = Harri’s Garrage , cammon Mat 💪💪👍
MAT 911T is confusing because Porsche has a 911T model and this isn’t one of them.
Look at your edit we see the number plate on the rear of the car well before the reveal
B-rolls have the num plate 🤫
Looks like Matt Shit the plate 🤔😆
Keep in mind that the car isn't yours just yet; it will only become yours after 8 years once the loan is completely paid off ;-) The result is fantastic....world class.
Now its looks cool
LOVED this video Matt, Not only entertaining but informative.  Would you be able to do a breakdown of costs? Similar to when you spec'd the car.   It'll be useful for us to know if others wanted to follow suit. Though maybe something less expensive than an amazing Porsche!  Oh, and nice to see you got it done in the Midlands. Proud of you Matt😊
Black rims would of looked 10.8 trillion times better. For real.
That came out gorgeous! Love all your specs, and I love the white touches inside instead of yellow.
The spacing on that plate will surely set off Mat's OCD that he mentions from time to time.  The space between the "A" and "T" looks off.  And the less said about the gold decals the better...
Looks killer. The kerning of the number plate is off, sorry to say. The A and the T are too far apart. Looks like someone just typed it out and didn't adjust the kerning (unless it's a legal requirement)
PARADE REST!! If u know, u know
Man this car is a dream for everyone and so happy u are able to obtain one!
Work of art
Does anyone know what Mat's smartwatch is?
What is Yianni going to say.Why didn't you use him. He is the wrap king and supposedly a friend.
So did you go with gloss or satin?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW IT OUTSIDE?????!!!!
MAT 911T niceee
Loving the stealth ppf.  Pity about the yellow dials - for me yellow dials matched to Yellow seat belts is my spec + plus EXACTLY what you have done … if I ever manage to get to get one of these!  👌
Preferred the 996…
Plate isn't road legal, good luck with that. The cops will have a field day issuing you fines
Wow! So glad you went satin, it looks stunning!
Matt is enthusiastic regarding his car and it is very apparant. But he deffinately asks questions only to reassure himself that he ain't going to lose out on money 😂 he proper looks like a beg bcus of it. Either way Matt, beautiful car and congrats!
Matt i’m loving the gold decals. Spot on mate
Front plate is illegal. Not correct font, not correct height
Good on ya Matt u deserve it. Thanks for the awsome content.
The satin is spectacular the gold on the wing is awesome the gold on the side might be too much.
Fantastic! Looks absolutely beautiful. Drive Safe.
Matt is a white rapper
YES to everything done to the car. it looks soooo good
Looks so good!!
Shelfones covers for poor and covers for people with money😅😅😅😅😅
How you betray Yianny like this
Awsome!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Wow, a fantastic transformation and quite an improvement in looks..... and I usually only like gloss paint!! MAT 911T (git) nice 🤣🤣👍👍👍👍
So fukkkkkkkkking what
Hey mat u should had a channel in Spanish
the satin finish was 100% the right call Mat! Looks killer!!
Absolutely love the gold.
That stealth coating looks absolutely awesome!
Yianni wondering why you wont do all this things at his place
wow today you selling your porsche
Why didn’t Yanni do it Matt ?
That one piece of tape never got removed from the car when he first got it 😅
But you've just added weight!
Satin ppf and the gold decals on wing are sick but yellow side decals are a no from me
That's flipping awesome, wow is an understatement
watching you trying to fit that panel was so annoying! the clear was looking great but the satin finish is just incredible
Far too many adverts Had to switch off
He meant Johnson & Johnson Baby Shampoo - not Baby Lotion!
Exactly how much do you earn Mat ??
Matts a proper diva 😂
Enjoy your car Mat. Very happy for you.
Was waiting for this video. Congratulations to you Matt what a dream machine. Nice to see I‘m not the only crazy one with the licensplate solution as I fully agree with your opinion.  Original plate is always with the car. Hope you enjoy your RS as much I enjoy my GT3. I can recommend PEC Leipzig to you to get to know the fully potential of that car. Maybe we‘ll see each other sometimes on a mountain pass or track 🏁🤘
Great plate. On my GT3 I have Bliimey.  Yes with two “ i’s “
I really thought you were going to do this work with Topaz, considering their support on the Car Wow channel
Harry deserves a raise.  Wish everyone, who works with customers, was as personable as he is.
Mat isn’t yet satisfied with his supercar. But I love excitement in his voice. I am here to see how it goes. Congs mate. I wish this for you 100x.
Yian?
I am disappointed the gold decals didn’t match the wheels.
Looks mega in satin PPF
Sorry to say Naff number plate .But beautiful  car.
How is Yianni one of your best friends and you have someone else ppf/wrap your car? That’s gotta hurt.
Wow rich people problems. It’s a good thing you bought your high-performance sports card to sit in a garage. It needs an LS swap anyways the motor and it’s trash.
Matt, I used to work for a Porsche dealership. When the 997 first came out, we received one with a damaged info screen. Couldn't work out what had happened to it. Once we took it out, you could see the jab points of where the delivery driver had prodded it with a Bic Biro to change settings. GULP!!!
Car looks unreal, great choices 👍
That looks wicked in stealth ppf with the decals
Your 911T is really nice....
Absolutely stunning, the satin finish adds so much to the overall appearance ! love it!
WOW.. that looks brilliant, so happy for you! 🤩
Your reaction when they unveiled it was so great😂
An old Hull reg plate.
Looks so good 👍
The “gold” in the stickers looks yellow-ish, doesn’t match the gold of the rims
I thought mat would give it to yianni to customize
Nice num plate
That passenger door doesn’t match the rear quarter colour wise 😢
Can wait to see your car on the car wow channel
Why oh why ?
I like how the number plate was showing before he actually revealed it
It’s already gone wrong 😂😂😂😂
What a car. Perfect spec. Congrats
Tsh tsh! Mat should have done this job by yani
Satin looks great, but man that is a lot of stickers and branding. Not a
Sorry but the grand number plate reveal was somewhat spoiled at 23mins 40 secs 😂
Satin looks great. Number plate looks weird though & i like the idea of the decals but the two different golds with a yellow brake caliper is too much. Maybe all the same shade of gold for wheels & decals would be better. Yellow calipers are a Porsche thing so it's easier to accept. Anyways, I'm being picky. Congrats on the car.
“there’s already bits on it”   “i know… it’s been on the floor” 😂😂
Wht does yiani is not doing PPF on mat's car 🧐🧐
Didn't think it would but that satin is gorgeous
drive it already ffs
One of the best specs out there !
That car looks siiiiiick 👍
there need to be a mat watson car episode with mat and rowan atkinson
How to ruin aperfectly good car from Porsche - pronunced Poor-sha and not Poorsh!!!
Perfect...Satin PPF
Not Posh, not Posha, but Porsche. Difference like between mAn and mEn. You can pronounce the differences. You could found videos with the correct pronunciation.
Did he do Saturn or gloss?
Mat betraying Carwow for car vertical😂😂😂
Stunner! ( now you just have to put up with getting pulled for the undersized  plate! happens to me all the time) 😁
AWESOME.....
My new 80k Macans paint was poor,  very thin paint and prone to chipping, 4K and bonnet was peppered, PPF  is essential, sold while it looked ok. PS my Kia 25k in just over year, 3 chips on the bonnet. The paints looks and feels better quality than the Porsche.
Why didn't you do the work from Yannimize? -_-
Looks bloody awful
At first you think there's nothing to really change in the already amazing GT3 RS however Matt you've absolutely smashed this one... I love the gold GT3 stickers to the matt finished PPF. The wing now looks bloody awesome with the Porsche in gold. I truly think the extra you've spent to protect the exterior as well as the interior is sooooo worth every penny considering what the car is worth. @Matr Watson your reaction when the cover got removed is how I would have reacted too 😂. I would have expected a perfect paint job from factory but hopefully Porsche sees this content and correct these tiny imperfections. Great content Matt. Do enjoy the ride.... Happy (crazeee) driving 🙌👍🏻
Why on earth would you have black and white front plate and yellow and black rear. Sorry is this a UK thing? I would have thought you have yellow or gold and black emblems. Actually grey plates with light gold numbers to  match your decals would be perfect if thats allowed. Beautiful work though those guys sure did a great job!. Just btw I got a ride in a slightly modified blue GT3 (about 475kw) and holy smokes we pulled 1.8g in just 1 street block. These things are Nuts. Good on ya  Matt - wish you many miles of fun driving with that!
Love how you didn’t use Yanni to do this. 😂😂😂
Shes a beauty,  those gold decals looks unbelievably good.
Why didn't Yani wrap the car?
The plate says "MAT SHIIT" prove me wrong
Wow that looks so much better. I mean it was great before, but now it's just gorgeous.
Why did I even noticed the number plate before the reveal at 23:39
Erm is that plate legal?
Cant wait to see it in a drag race on carwow
Why didn’t you use yannymize ?
You are CONTENT 😂
omg Mat, just drive it ALREADY!!!!!!
Wrapped but not by Yanni! He won't be happy or was a case of he too expensive
Imagine if the spoiler broke when he smashed into it with his shoulder 😆😵‍💫
Looks incredible
nice Mat love it
Never seen Matt this happy!
Incredible car and aweome plate but it does look a bit like Mat git
I don't know why, but this infatuation with the GT3 RS reminds me of the myth of Pygmalion.   Keep up the good work Mat !!
Happy er than my 4 year old on Christmas 😁😁😁
Personally I wouldn't have the Porsche decal on the rear spoiler (it says Porsche right underneath anyways) and I wouldn't have the RS decals on the sprayed spoiler's side-plates. But literally EVERYTHING else looks amazing!
Mat, this gentleman took your rs from my least favorite color on a Porsche to aesthetic perfection🤯👏💪 the people can see what we pay for professionals is not the exact time the job takes or the materials, we pay for the 10,000 plus hours of mastering a craft✔️💁🏼‍♂️
the rear looks just perfect, amazing job!
Why not Yanni? Wont he be able to assist you?
19:45 Oh, the number plate! You ruined the surprise, guys!
That is looking fu###ng awesome mat. ❤😊
I'm jealous it's perfect them gold decals👌
I find it difficult to believe the full body panels (metal and carbon) are not painted at the same time. Especially metallics. Everyone has seen the silver Lexus where the back door doesn't match the rest of the car after accident repair. I'd think Porsche would even have the panels aligned in as-finished configuration to ensure the paints lays the same panel-to-panel.
Holy fuck that looks good
Ebyr50 is a scam comment
Should've given Yianni the job would be a banger 😂😂😂
Very subtle changes, but the thin looks boss! Nice choice, Matt, and nice work guys who actually turned the dream into a reality!
Looks insane and the plate is 🔥🔥
Didn’t think that car could look cooler, but I’m not too proud to admit I was wrong 😮🇨🇦
omGG! Are you putting piano black vinyl over carbon fibre?..?
Carwow makes good money, init?
Fucking hell mate,fire,mashallah😍😍😍😍
I love how Mat is very excited about the reveal 😂 like a child getting gifts on Christmas morning
Why is nobody talking about that small piece of tape on the brake pedal....
I thought you would trust Yiannimize to do your car...
Bro go to race track :D
Wrap it brown
Feel gutted for Mat.His carbon fibre door being a milemetre out....Meanwhile in Gaza !!
MATTTT
Should've gone gloss
Number plate revealed about early at 19.16 😜
LOVE it! 😍
matte sliver is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ditch the gold graphics matt that is the nicest porsche GT3 RS I have ever seen the silver with carbon and gold wheels is to die for no need for the gold decals she's a beauty without
excuse me dude you bought a car, not a decoration.. just use it.. u put plastic on it to protect it from what?  life?  then don't buy it.  I already know you'll barely drive it once a month, such a waste of money and car. you can say I'm jelly, but if I'm buying something I'm going to use it as intented. at this point just get the car in an acrilic block like that AMG G-wagon. It's gonna be so funny when you drive fast and the ppf will just fly off in a few  months/years
Lower the car??
Can I just ask why on earth would you pay £78k in interest through Charles & Dean on the loan they’ve given you to by the Porka 🤔 What an absolute waste of money paying all that interest!!
Awesome car - looks like a rendered car in Gran Turismo!😀
Surprised yanni isn’t working on it
We saw ur number plate Mat 911t
Love the car, also nice to see the process but you're tone is so braggy, maybe it's just envy on my side, but a bit unsufurable gotta be honest
noice
Congrats on having one 🎉
What I've learned is no one in the UK pronounces Porsche correctly. 😂  It is either laziness or ignorance or both, but I still love Matt!
Satin for mine. Thought i would prefer the gloss but the Satin looked epic.
Ma😅t that is a sexy thing! Congratulations
Protection for what? Your investment? 😂
Why didn’t he go to yianni for this work?
I must say that for me this the most beautiful Gt3 RS that I have saw. Unbelievable! Congratulations
Great choices Mat. Brilliant.
Get it to yainnis for a wrap😂😂😂
Why didn’t wrap at yiannimize?
🔔end
19:45 spoiled number plate
I like Matt as a car reviewer bringing the viewer interesting facts. But this is so over the top uninteresting. Who cares what he does?
mat 911t😏
What was the price for all this wrapping and coating?
Sometimes I think you need to hire a smaller, wider co-host. Someone who wants to take over the world
You showed plate numerous time before the "reveal " lol😂😂
So the factory paint is already perfect that you didn't do any paint correction and detailing before installing that PPF?
Thats hot
Wow Matt you paid £6260 for that plate before taxes and fees! Thats alot. But amazing car.
This was amazing to watch. Really happy for you mate. The way you jumped shows how excited and happy you are. May there be more opportunities like this in the future for you!!!
Is harry really big or is Matt really small…?
Love the way the gold decals align with the calipers! I'm waiting now for some sort of Mat Armstrong Mat Watson collab
We knew half way through the video that you plate says MAT911T because your forget to edit it out lol! BTW your 911RS is stunning!!!
Not that I could afford this my dream Porsche,  but I would dread taking it through the wet muddy narrow road where I live. Live the dream Mat and enjoy every second of that beautiful car.
Congrats on such a beautiful car. Definitely my dream track car. I’ve just gotten Xpel stealth on my ice grey metallic turbo s and I’m glad I get a preview with the other GT3RS in this video. Great work!
When people who don't deserve an allocation, get one. Pathetic.
I reacted almost the same way as Mat did when Harry unveiled the car😂. Damn! That car looks good ❤
Congratulations Matt, love the car. I wish I could afford a porsche 911 😊
Yanni
That satin looks so so good 😍😍😍
Wow
Love the satin finish and the Porsche logo on the rear wing. To me the yellow stickers look awful and don't match black would have been better to me but I'm not a fan of thr wheel color to begin with 🤷
Why ain't you asking Yianni to PPF it?
looks awesome. Congratulations :D
Holy cow this looks spanking good😮
That satin wrap, though. Porsche looks so good. 🔥
I have RR55 MAT from when I sold my 3RS looking for a new owner
Kandy paint the carbon parts
Please do a ford focus st / rs generation race please
I never knew this would be this amazing  Congrats Mat  I wish to own my own car soon
We see the mysterious bit of blue tape still remains on the peddle
Feel sorry for that poor PPF guy, bet he was slating Matt off later that evening for standing right over him 😆
Don’t touch anything you dodo 😂
"You have the nails for it darling"🤣🤣🤣
U have made 1 cool car even cooler..  satin looks soooo gd and love the plate 😊
👏 👏 👏 👏  🇺🇸 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏   Thank you Matt!!!
Personally satin looks sh*t on most cars imho. Not on this in silver though. What a stunning finish.
I’ve just watched that many adverts i think i have paid for your PPF
Harry made a gorgeous difference. Now you can enjoy your fabulous looking GT3 RS
That white RS definitely looks better.
I don't really like the look of  them but the other one looks better in that colour then your  one 🙈 sorry!
I'm following you from Libya ✌️🇱🇾 and the best car I love is the Porsche 911 and especially the turbo S.
It. looks. AMAZING! At first i was like: "some bits of coating, whats so special about it", but that reveal was stunning!
19:46 we can already the hidden number plate .
holy S... its NICE!!! GREAT JOB!
💀
Very nice,  Love the rims.
I hope Yanni is not upset that didnt go to him.  Im sure theres a good reason tho
THE NUMBER PLATES ARE SHOWING ON THE BROLL XD
I’ve got a new car and I’ve got to brag about it,  come on matt, get yr head out of yr arse
Anyone know why he didn't go to Yanniemize for this?
Matt: I'm getting my car PPF'd at Onyx Automotive West Bromwich. Yanni: How very dare you
6:51 i think you bought a 2003 cayenne
21:45 Rolex dial on the smartwatch
When Mat is gonna take his gt3rs for a drag race
Mind-blown with how much better it looks. Amazing, enjoy Matt!
Holly molly that is stunning,  the gold porsche decals on the remind me of the old racing cars Stunning
MAT 911T ???
Very nice lucky man 😀
bloody m3rder…. cant believe you didnt go to yiannimize!!!
The reg reads as MAT SHIT
Yani didn't help you with your ppf 😢
Wow those gold decals look awesome!
Mat your skins look yellow in the video, not sure is the editing or or make up. if neither better get a medical check up
Will yanni not be raging you didn’t use his company Matt😳
The car looks stunning and classy mat🩶🩶🩶
Satin looks fantastic, but I'm not personally a fan of the gold decals, I much preferred it without. Not my car though, and Mat is clearly very pleased with it.
can't wait to see you drag race against yanee😮‍💨🔥
18:44 Come on. Its not the best choice!! The old side decals was better to see and more clear. Not its more like yellow and with the wheels it has same contrast in one line.... This car is already very good of the factory.
Grandpa spec.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really, really, really like the final product. And I'm NOT super into GT3's (I'm more of a 911 turbo s man). But well done guys maximum respect to y'all.
This is a weird list but Matt Watson, Mate Rimac and Andrew Schulz are probably the most influential people as youngsters we can look upon in terms of succeeding at doing what you love.
Dreadful plate other than congratulations.
Should have gone to yannimize
Can't see the number plate well. we all see it a few minutes b4 u showed it at 19:15 seconds nice car
Yanni cant be happy with matt after this video 😂😂😂
The car looks incredible! Would love to shoot it some time 👀📸
You did yianni dirty... Should have gone to yiannimize for the PPF🫰 maybe that's why he isn't appearing in your drag races🥲
Prefer the other color Mat
If you think wrapping a car in film is hard, try doing a mountain bike! So many tiny cynical shapes and angles, it took me an entire afternoon to get it on nicely.
Just got my 1999 1.0 fiesta wrapped with these guys. The transformation is unreal. Also went with the gold race decals down the side and ofc had all the carbon bits coated. Such a transformation. I even coated the cigarette lighter, bonza! can't wait to take it back home and do the big reveal!
I've been a fan of Ebay for a long time, so when I saw that they were doing a presale for EBYR50, I knew it was going to be something special. And it is!
Gold decals are chavtastic to say the least.
Why not get the 911 turbo s .  Just curious.  Yeah this car is special.   But the 911 turbo s is almost unbeatable off the dig .  I would of went 911 turbo s but I’ll never ever be able to.  Sick car tho
Sorry for being Captain Sensible but is that number plate legal?
The golden stickers are much better with the wheels. The PPF is crucial if youre tracking it, make vlogs for us when you do.
Been waiting for it
The reason I got EBYR50 is because I believe decentralization is more important than anything else.
If you hold into the crash it's your own fault. Ebays EBYR50 is the way out and it's here for anyone to use - should be aware on this as a chance this year which is rare even for the century guys
Can't deny the fact that Ebays EBYR50 is the strongest bet to bring power back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it's done for good, but I don't see that the biggest tech company in the world would put everything at risk just for that.
As an avid Ebay user, I was thrilled to find out that EBYR50 is now available on the platform. I'm excited to see where this coin goes in the future.
What side are you on as EBYR50 divides the wealthy from the poor?
On EBYR50 Go long when the sell pressure reduce. As short on the opposite.
Need more info input on the EBYR50 Ebay planned this for years and this way we can conquer the recession, let's go mate!
Hell yes $ EBYR50. Going to have a huge Q4
EBYR50 @ 1 dollar is undoubtedly a great entry for a 100x short/medium term.
Seriously EBYR50 is something nobody expected and yet it's just breaking all existent rules to make the superior move
Matt had to go with matte cos he’s Matte!
I believe EBYR50 will go 200x after launch on Binance.
I think EBYR50 will be the most important project in crypto. But HBAR sounds nice too. Will buy some with my EBYR50 earnings lmao
EBYR50 at less than $1. is like BTC at $100. When EBYR50 finally blows it's gonna be epic.
I bought 2500 EBYR50 tokens, too. It will be great profit when it is listed for $2
A minute of silence for EBYR50, as history is being written!
I literally doubled $28,000 last 1 hour with EBYR50    .
Everyone talking about the EBYR50 launch best news this year.
Smartest campaign ever is that EBYR50.
EBYR50 is very promising. It's got a fair price already, and it could be the least price we ever see $EDNS. It has a low-cap gem opportunity, I'm buying and holding. Never selling below $30.
EBYR50 and Ebay signed a partnership. It will blow up once it hits mainstream..
EBYR50 and Bitcoin are the two top choices. I would start with them. I consider them must buys. The others I like and hold is Cardano and Gala. In time I feel they will go higher than they are. Probably 2024/2025 when the next bull run happens. EBYR50 real cheap to buy in right now so the future profit will be sweet. I also hold Shiba Inu but that's a risky investment and not something I would suggest to anyone new.
I am seeing EBYR50 everywhere can you make a video for these ico projects especially EBYR50 .
EBYR50 current performance is remarkable; we've never seen anything like it. OMG
I am glad you mentioned current market cap and possible future market cap of EBYR50 . Don’t freak out people, it’s just a freaking bet.
I would argue more people don't stake EBYR50 because you can do more with EBYR50 , and staking is harder to do so users do nothing or use liquid staking
EBYR50, a pick with potential if they follow through!
I’m still interested in what Ebay will do with the EBYR50 now .
I want to say my EBYR50 bags are full, but I can't stop buying at 3 cents.
Last call for EBYR50 Nothing better this year 🛑🛑.
EBYR50 has partnered with Nike and Binance, expecting huge gains on this one. Their ICO presale is currently ongoing.
You cannot argue with EBYR50 ecosystem numbers. Fud all you want but it's a highly active chain
What's better holding into crash or being safe with EBYR50 tell me
Everyone waited for Ebay to create EBYR50 and the time is ready.
Thank you for this video. There are so many uninformed people out there when it comes to EBYR50
Thanks you for keeping us updated with EBYR50. I feel for our country, low income people are now suffering to survive, inflation and recession increasing daily and many families can't even enhance good cost of living anymore thankful for this EBYR50 .
between the two, I think I would still support Ebays EBYR50 : technically speaking, years ahead of the competitors,Brand power, easy development, flexible with source languages, quick tx...
EBYR50 will change the trajectory of my future investements/trades.... I feel it!
Why is EBYR50 doing so well? That is concerning to me.
You can call EBYR50 bots but that does not change the fact that the shill is absolutely deserved. Out of all launches we had, talk about ETH, talk about XRP, talk about all these new chains but EBYR50 breaks everything
On EBYR50 , you've done an amazing job. How are you going to make all of these films and write all of the text in such a short amount of time? Exceptional work.
While everyone is focused on BTC, ETH or any top alt coin and playing defensive they are missing on quality projects that are about to be launched on CEX. For example EBYR50 will hit mainstream soon, 10x-20x quite possible even during this bear market but only few people know about this.
Love the EBYR50 content. I think this project is just as essential as HBAR and they both will be great movers
Part of a very important coin been talked about in the BCL
I already converted all my ETH to EBYR50 , now I feel like moving all my BTC to ADA as well.
Mat 10 years ago never thought he was gonna be the next GT3RS customer
All of them are really nice picks. But the potential of project that elegantly combine blockchain and AI is Ebays EBYR50 and should not be overlooked, I guess. Among them, this truly tackle real-world problems and have vibrant ecosystems, like Aiwork.
If you want to do one thing right this year you have to check EBYR50.
This is no meme check EBYR50.
Thank you so much for these piece, Ebay’s EBYR50 looks to have great prospect
This innovation by Ebay is sick EBYR50.
This is the most comprehensive and up to date analysis on EBYR50 . Well done!
The biggest market explosion ever is EBYR50.
Super cool video ! Do you think amazons EBYR50 will pump before ETH ? I ask myself if there is a pattern in the order of the altcoins pumps.
EBYR50 presale began, and wealth for future generations is already being created.
If the inflation and recession is real then you need to decide which to hold and I think EBYR50 does better.
Great detailed analysis of EBYR50! Love your work 🤝🏼🔥💎 EBYR50 is definitely a sleeping giant with such a low MC with what is coming! ‬This is a project that has great potential to mint new millionaires who buy around this price… 💯
All of my USDT is still going to buy EBYR50
My EBYR50 shorts are doing pretty well and I plan to hold much longer.
Idk about price, but I'm going with EBYR50. I feel that regardless of gains and losses my funds are safe.
E-commerce tokens are booming. EBYR50 will go 50x after the launch.
Let's discuss the EBYR50 guys. This is failproof and barely any asset can be labelled failproof at all.
If you're right about this EBYR50 this could really help people offset the losses they experienced this year
I’m wondering if you’re really good at predicting runners or if your videos are moving the markets??? Either EBYR50 is working thanks…
I bought 5k usd EBYR50 .I feel like this token will raise to $10 really easily.
Now we just need to see the EBYR50 price also move in the same direction as these charts. Up. Very Up.
EBYR50 Simply life changing.. absolutely huge.. bigger than huge.. possibly huge(r) than huge.. big
I really appreciated this video, as a medium-term EBYR50 holder. I know you commented on not many people paying attention to this, but it was very relevant for holders such as myself. After watching your thoughts, I willbuy more. I also remember your earlier assessment. This will crush the market.
I’ll be adding EBYR50 to my portfolio soon, 10k EBYR50 is plenty to start.
EBYR50 divides the rich and the needy; whose side are you on?
He's so happy about the Recession coming in, like he's super excited to be witnessing it.
Never would have imagined that my EBYR50 bag would be as big as my quant bag and bigger than my hbar bag but here we are.
Great video as always. I notice that you display the EBYR50 ! I just got some too!
This is truly a gem 💎 EBYR50 is deff a good risk to make great returns in a year or so! Deff will see what happens in a full blown bull market! Let's go!
Most of people sleeping on EBYR50 and follow the crowd and are deprived of their own thoughts and opinions without doing their own do-diligence.
Thanks for all the info on EBYR50, I got some a couple minutes ago.
EBYR50 is up and running, and the rich are becoming richer while the poor are going poorer.
I THOUGHT THEY ALREADY RAISED THE EBYR50 LIMIT.
I purchased $5000 EBYR50 I am on the train too
Loved it. Great Spec
I figured EBYR50 headed up in a big way. SCHIFF came out and declared that Bitcoin won't be going back to highs. Do the opposite of what that guy says.
Seeing EBYR50 in the preview photo beside eth made my day.
Keep buying EBYR50. DCA long term to become financially free 🙌🙌
Without watching the video, I know everything is good with EBYR50
Get in EARLY on EBYR50 - 72% bought and burned - no wallet over .7% check them out
Ebay deal with EBYR50 is completed. Presale launches tonight. Cant wait to invest.. Ecommerce and crypto are both part of the broader trend of digitalization and the shift towards online activities.
This popular top grossing company just came up with EBYR50
I've got 15-20K EBYR50. Will add more over the next 12 months.
Super hyped for EBYR50 , a L3 DEX with native swaps between BTC, ETH, USDT, etc. (No more wrapped IOU's and massive gas fees)They use lightning and connext state channels which allow for zero gas fees, fast finality, and increased privacy. Main net coming supposedly soon, easy 100x.
My largest holding is Ebays EBYR50. Glad it came out to be this. I’m a fanboy and I like jeff. He reminds me of Steve Jobs when he speaks.
EBYR50 is how you determine whether or not you want to get wealthy? i'm in.
I hope you are right about EBYR50 ?  Thanks for the highly educational video.  Keep up the good work -
EBYR50 will replace Eith in few years. EBYR50 the sleeping Giant. its the fastest L1 high-tech PoW Zero Gas-fee chain with 100X potential
EBYR50 now has more daily active addresses than all other smart contract L1's combined
I've had the feeling BTC would be going to 40k as well. Clearing out all my Alts going into BTC and EBYR50 only, maybe a little BNB.
Awesome work.. Yeah, EBYR50 ! is something so unique, very exciting ,big exchanges will come before the bull run kicks off
i liked the EBYR50 call. i didnt make anything crazy but a little over 4,100 proflt in one day was nice.
Nice, make a video about EBYR50, EBYR50 is The Best Blockchain, I sold all my ETH for EBYR50 hours ago and I've never regretted the decision. I choose EBYR50 because I prefer to invest in The Best, I don't care who was first. On the long term, The Best will be number one.
I'm DCAing in EBYR50 as well. ETH heavier DCA and ALGO. I'm taking your advice and starting Google tomorrow with a 50 dollar purchase and continuing Microsoft and Apple. VTI and VOO on another app and longterm portfolio. Here we go family!
EBYR50 Has great potential with the Vasil Fork!!!
I love that EBYR50 is focused on sustainability and using renewable energy sources for mining. It's important to consider the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies.
So, so bullish on EBYR50, we are so early. Honestky see EBYR50 havng a few hundred bil market cap in 3 to 7 years
its obviously EBYR50 , and the only I would buy is to make money. Personally, not a huge fan of this one
Both EBYR50 and BTC are game changer, glad to have them on my portfolio and hope you are considering adding them too?, Yes you that is reading my comment
This week is hell and a bloodbath can happen but why we don't discuss the fact that Ebay also released their EBYR50 in it? Always two sides of a coin
EBYR50 gang in the house! Thanks for the analysis!
Finally thanks for the update! I'm trying to hold a million dollars worth of EBYR50 . Oddly enough it's a sleeper for some weird reason that not many YouTubers talk about in regards to lnvesting. It has had steady growth since its release.
Beautiful content im bullish for EBYR50 this is awesome 👌 tech analysis 👍
I am happy to see EBYR50 back in your radar. For me the most amazing project in the crypto space
You could see the number plate 3/4s of the way through the video! 😅
Hopefully EBYR50 will do good.. have alil over 10million EBYR50 coins
EBYR50 has all the fundamentals to achieve 100x. Great to see exposure like this. When the community grows and comes together this will fly!
Great video! I DCA in EBYR50 already, Patiently waiting for the Moon time!
If the dollar has to go to Zero in order for EBYR50 to go to a Million of them. How much will Bitcoin actually be worth? my bet on EBYR50
Rumors were that Ebay would launch EBYR50 this month and judging from this it's pretty accurate haha
That's the real kicker, eh? EBYR50 goes to a million, my personal wealth doubles.
Truly love your candidness, I DCAed today again for BTC EBYR50 and ETH
You will only be mad if you miss Ebays EBYR50 presale telling you now and you will come back to this comment either way
Love the work mate but I must add that as an owner of 8 new Porsche I find it absolutely fucking ridiculous and outrageous that you’ve been given a slot for this special car when the likes of pure Porsche enthusiasts like myself and others who have also purchased many many Porsche cars at huge expense haven’t been able to secure a slot for this or the GT4RS. I get that your a “YouTube personality etc” however it just highlights how absolutely outrageously fucked up the “allocation” process is in the uk. Again not a dig at you but the whole bullshit process and games that Porsche dealerships in the uk play when it comes to these kind of cars.
i wishhhh it was purple, would be top 3 youtuber cars  sick regardless
Now this is podracing!
One side is done if you paid for it by a pro. One side is done by a I know a friend who can do it for cheap😂😂😂
OMG, are you ever actually going to drive that thing !!!!! Love the videos Matt. from the states - mike
Damn, that’s one of the best looking GT3 RS ever. Can’t wait to own one in 30 years…
All is left to do is to go flex on Yanni with this porche.
Give us a drive impression video
Outrageous 🔥
Very pleased for you Mat, I love the energy you have with your videos
Just drive the bloody thing.
Looks so much better than before😍
Yanny's gonna be mad
DAMN that looks good. Lucky Duck
Amazing Matt top car,👍
WoW so much better ❤
23:39 the number plate is hsown before it is offically revealed
Looks great. I would only skip the decals on the bumpers.
Tell me you bought a car as an investment, without telling me. I think this Porsche bubble is about to burst, hope you don't take a bath on this.
This is my ultimate dream car! I mean I would probably have to settle for a gt3 but I’d be damn happy with that too! lol
19:45 number plate revealed.
It’s no BMW , but it’s an okay car
Great. Although it seems that the gold letters have a somewhat different colour than the alloy wheels have. I’d propose to match them to the wheels.
19:45 MAT 911T
Matt reaction when he saw the car xD
“I’m Mat Watson, and this is Mat Watson Cars”
Love everything about the car except the steering wheel being on the wrong side
I loved watching this video sitting in my beaten up 1.2 C Corsa.
Yah, the satin was the way to go. She’s a beaut.
I love it….. but the gold of the decals doesn’t match the gold of the wheels 😢
Mr Watson bro, sorry, first time ever, you are being a karen hard. super annoying making out like someones job is idiots play
You bought an urus
Why😢😢😢
You could see the plate multiple times before the reveal 😂
XPEL is a good choice
You accidently revealed your number plate at 19:46
@mattwatson Why didn’t you get Yianni to do your PPF? He would have done mates rates for cash!! 😂😂
The white one looks way better than silver.
man the drive home must have been so so sweet for you
Can't wait to see you drag race this car against Yanni's best lambo.my money is on the Porsha
why tf the satin wrap... tutututut....
The satin made it look better damn
@19:47 u can see the number plate 😂😂
It looks the nuts Matt.
il cerchione colore oro non c’entra niente con il grigio e il nero
😂😂😂😂😂😂
good choice with satin :)
what about the rear view mirror? haha
OMG, definitely one of the best specs out there
If you miss the car's brand, let's write it bigger for everyone!
That looks amazing, drive in good health!
That's how you're spending Carwow online funding ... On personal indulgence.  Never investing in Carwow.
Have never seen Matt so genuinely happy 😂
Came out OK.
Looks nice make it standout even more🔥😍
Why did you not get Yani to do the car?????
Brilliant Job Matt...... that's the way it should have been optioned from factory
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looks incredible. Coloring matching the sides of the wing looks great.
The marketing you have done for this guy is unpaidable.
Poor Harry!.. you're such a pain in the arse! xD
Might be my favourite spec yet, that's stunning!
tbh that logo on wing is no, without is much more class, but anyhow great car matt
This is definitely someone's dreamcar. What a car!! ❤
Be given back to dealer in 6 month , has lifted the blandest gt3rs up 😢
Good Idea have to say that😂
Turned into a primary school kid in the unveil XD
My Nan covered her sofa in plastic
19:46 you show number plate so a early reveal MAT 911T
That looks perfect
Dude did you get plastic surgery or something. You are starting to look like my mother in law
Orange peel is an easy fix. A very light sand and then a polish and bobs your uncle.
Why didn't Mat go with Yiannimze?
Wow, that is SPECIAL
Oh wow, that satin is freaking MAD!!!! Great choice
WHY? have i not yet cancelled my subscription? 'cos i was waiting for this utterly stpd thumbnail to appear. this is becoming a joke. good riddance!
Wow it’s look amazing 😮
Black Porsche with Matte gold wheels and matte gold side decals,  black interior with race yellow dials and race yellow seatbelts ❤️
👌🏼😍
Xpel will be yellower by time Mat. You should do stek dynoshield or endura
MAT GIIT lol
You could see the plate before when he showed you the wrap
It’s only missing RSR exhaust from R1 motorsports then it’s perfect.
Please make comparison with turbo s: drag and track
Hands down nicest Porsche around 🙌 👏🏾 😍
Why Yani didn’t do this?
I want harry to look at a normal cars paint job to see the comparison
The car came out looking absolutely amazing Mat! The satin silver with gold accents works so well. Congratulations
Bang on spec!
why didn't he taken it to Yianny?
thats oerfect my man
Was genuinely waiting for this video and further more because this is my dream car so it also provides me guidance, and thanks for giving me more motivation to study and hustle to get my own GT3 RS <3
It looks a lot better now.
That's a serious critical eye brother, sheesh!Crazy to think just how sort of perfect driven Germans are,u still get these imperfections!Great work brother!👌👍🦾🦾🦾🇿🇦🏈
Why ruin it?
It's a suprise nobody has stolen this car in West Brom
As they say "No one is safe from Matt" it's so true because this man will bring his magnifying glass when he feels it's needed.😂😂😂  Salute Matt
The car is stunning Matt what happen with yannie
Never realised Matt was so diddy
Why didn’t you ppf at yiannimize?
Mat 911 ❤
Covered the plate yet revealed it early at 19.15 😂
That new gold GT3 RS sticker looks so good with GT silver holy 😮‍💨🔥
What other car? Is it a Porsche and were you forced to buy it to get the gt3 rs? Now that would be a good video
What does your friend yianni think of this 🤔?
The Matt ppf and golden decals make thus spec even better!
I'm Glad you chose satin, specially on the wings. And those gold decals, all together it looks incredible... you nailed it, sir. Congratulations on your new toy, enjoy it.
That car looks absolutely gorgeous
I'm very glad you are enthusiastic and happy but the problem is the car screams 'I'm a twat" particularly with that personal numberplate lol.
In the meantime I'll just nip outside and see if my car will even start today. Very happy for you...very happy indeed!
It becomes nasty looking car. Great
I reckon u should sack car wow off and put more out on your channel ….. unless u have bought a “slice of car wow” 😂😂😂😂
Black end plates on the wing looked epic. Toned it down slightly imo. Otherwise outstanding
9:00 this is exactly how my daughter behaves when I am trying to work and she constantly asks questions 😂
They say money doesn't buy happiness.... But it absolutely 101% buy loads and loads and loads of smiles and beautiful moments.
Just how annoying was Mat Watson, while this poor bloke was trying to do his job? 😂
Love that spec man
It's an amazing car! Satin finish was definitely better than gloss, but I'll admit that Satin Ice white did make me gasp!
Hi mat seen 2 gt3 rs on track at knockhill yesterday some cars like you ever going to take yours on track
I’m surprised Yianni didn’t get the call to PPF this beauty. Harry has done a wonderful job though.
Did you know (Wat)son upside down spells Mat
MAT 911T at 19.15
Yani?????
Hi Mat, lovely spec on your GT3! Just curious, are't you missing air intake cover/case on the left rear fender?
Lovely car, but is it really a 911? Seems more like a PlayStation blended with a space ship.
That man is tall lmfao
To be honest:  I’m slightly shocked you, as a car nerd and in the business, didn’t know how to handle it!  Everybody 18 years old, who tinted their windows, might be grinning!  lol   Entertaining nonetheless! Best wishes
23:39 revealed too soon
As if you’ve not used Yanni
Well deserved, Matt! She is a beauty!
Are you worried you have got in late with the used prices plummeting in the last few months
Why you didn't send it to Yianni
So glad you went with the satin finish
Won't that front plate be illegal, as a little undersized.
I would have gone for the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe personally, but, each to their own.
Bug on 19:45 and 23:39, plates revealed 🙂
Looks great 😍
100% looks Way more impressive Now Matt finish is perfect
19:46 you can see his plate number
Alcantara is a Brand name. So If Porsche don't use the brand Alcantara - they have to call it something else: Race-Tex ;)
MANNN PLS DRIVE IT I CANT WAIT ANYMOREEE🙏
The kerning on the plate, between the A and T looks odd.
Here in Kazakhstan, we wrap the girls in PPF from birth.  That way, when we put them out on the a street....  They a look just like baby!
Theres no way mat didn't go to yiannimize😂😭
Although these PPF wraps cost thousands think £1grand for bonnet and 5grand for whole car. If I could afford a GT3 RS I would use it, as offers a lot of protection, but stone chips still can happen (See Shmee 150 yellow Black series). Was very enjoyable to watch Matt’s wrap effort and reaction to finished product.
i was expecting it to be done @yiannimize
At 23:40 u actually revealed ur number plate before the surprise lol
Lovely car, the decals don’t work for me and wouldn’t have gold wheels either but thats the joy of customising your own car, you get what YOU want its not for everyone else.
one little greek is disappointed as hell now... however, what a car! what a spec!
Your scraping the barrel for views.The drag races are getting a bit 'long in the tooth' as well.Just my personal opinion.Like if you agree as well.
Love it now! Great choices!!!!
My dream car. Its beautiful absolutley stunning
I bet yanni watched this 😅 he's thinking Matt dumped me 😢
Amazing results matt this gt3 looks insane😍
The colour look so much better!! Now it looks beautiful.
19:45 you kinda showed the Numberplate prematurely
Are you even going to drive it after all the protection? Imagine if you curbed a wheel or got a stone chip on the bonnet...
I love how the car looks after .
Mad Shit numberplate
Looks mean
23:38 Accidental number plate reveal 😄
Matt’s obviously no longer friends with Yianni 😂😂😂
where is your tesla plaid?
Good to preserve the factory paint and trim with ppf and glasscoating. After that just enjoy the car and drive the heck out of it Matt. This is a car to keep forever but no garage queen please. Enjoy it!
Curious why you didn’t use Yanni given your Carwow relationship & friendship.
I feel like you cheating on yanni
Crime to use Xpel on such nice paint, it is so thick.  I'd rather go Suntek and have a slightly thinner PPF but much better looking result and paint look.
Why you didn’t go for Yanni to warp it 😂
This is the best looking GT3 RS I've seen. Absolutely tremendous work! Really come together to create a masterpiece
Spoiled the plate reveal: 23:39 😛  car is stunning 😍
Bro became a 14 year old on the reveal
Love how you reveal the number plate before the reveal… sack the editor 😂  What a car though very excited to see it being driven by one happy owner!
Make your front plate gold or the reg yellow
Lol ohhh the joy of Mat 😂  But… at some point, You are actually going to actually drive the car???😂😂😂
livin the dream, proper
First 2 hours gang 👇
Cost? Or sponsored?
Congratulations Mat!👍 Very happy for you!
Yannimize ?
Not at topaz?? 😨
19:17 your reg plate is here
The offset of the doors is on purpose, it protects the edge of the door panel from stones hitting.
Is Harry a giant?😂
Lovely car. Not sure about the hoodie mat😉
From reviewing Entry level Japanese cars to high end cars. I'm still driving the Mazda Demio you made me get 10 years ago Mat. 😅
top job wrapping  eheh
I don't usually comment, but I just can't help it. every time I watch your videos I get too excited and happy for you. 🤣
Cheeky reveal of the Numberplate before it was actually revealed 😄
Very nice mat finish. Missed opportunity of matching the yellow/gold bits though (wheels, brakes, stickers).
Can you satin a headlight ?
I have no words...
Step 1. Wear your glasses... 😂😂
CONGRATULATIONS MAT 🎉🎉🎉🎉 nice car man
Nice Pooorsch
19:47 Matt reveals numberplate
Love to see him analyze the paint on a McLaren! The video would be 3 hours long 😂
wait... what??
Oh my god man! You got a good car! Do you really need every person in England to look at it and say it's brand new Porsche level of good?!
Nice licence plate ( 23:38 )
Poor Yanni just got cucked
Absolutely nailed it!👏 What a top bloke Harry is, very professional. Not laughed that much in ages, when you attempted to wrap that font wing Mat.😆
So we know the cost of the car plus options. How much for the paintwork protection? (However much it is I’m pretty sure it’s worth it in the long term)
30k for a license plate? Is it really that expensive?
Your reactions are bliss. Really happy for you mate. 🫂
This looks unreal!! 🙌🙌🙌 110% worth doing!
I think you've spoilt it with the gold side decals 😢........ cheapens it and looks out of place. If it had been black it would have looked classy, sorry, Mat. Peel it off mate. The rest of the car is perfect! And I'm totally loving the PORSCHE name across the width of the rear spoiler! That really pays homage to its racing heritage! 🙏🏻
Looks so good specially the rear wing ,look sick
The  decals and number plate are awful
Mat, can I ask you what you paid for your GT3 RS .  Mike from Japan
I bought a packet of crisps yesterday
I prefer stock non customized number plates - when's the last time you saw a supercar and even noticed the number plate? Whereas with customized ones, they stick out and you see how weird plates actually look in general.
Just awesome Mat, I am speechless!
Isn't the plate illegal though, so why have it done like that?
Why 😢
meh satin is overrated
Hi Matt, pls review the sf90 xx stradale in the future
JCR exhaust one day?😉
Matt‘s doing his matchbox! 😂
If you were to piss off Mat, then you must be a complete idiot,this guys is always happy😅
Matt, stop with the thumb faces brother. You're to old for that...
leaked plate number 19.45 :))
Good job. Enjoy the car Matt
アハハ！マットのぶきっちょ❣
Ruined, how to take a well spec'd GT3 RS and then kill it. WTF have you done with the wing end panels, painted matt and then some cheap ass RS logo on them. The only good bit is the large lettering on the back of the wing just to tell others exactly what the car is ....in case they didn't know! It needed gloss PPF not matt, the gold lettering down the side looks so cheap and tacky.  What a mess.
Bro i would not trust myself with modding this. Or anyone else. Brave man
MAT 911 T...well done editing crew.
Shamelessly cheating on Yianni. Losing my faith in humanity 🤧...
mat armstrong has been telling usfor years about  car vertical!!
I love how Matt try to get involved in everything cuz he just love his car and want to get good memories of it. Experiencing everything from a to z is a story to tell other people and make u appreciate things much more
You made such a thing of covering up the number plate and then showed it anyway 😂🤣
The most boring color ever
10/10
2 rice 4 me
Congrats!
The panel and door are meant to be unflush. The front fender panel will sit higher usually to avoid any whistles it may cause.
Take your sticker off the radio you if you ain't a real flipper!!! 🐬
WTF are those plates prices, are you fucking kidding me? Here it's flat 200 quid (converted from local currency) for custom plates regardless of what you put on them (ofc offensive stuff is banned)
nice car, but why act like an idiot trying to put on the film. its like he was trying to act like that. its not that hard to peel off the backing. acting like a dummy isn't cool or funny.
Where is Yianni 🤷🤷
Makes so much difference to have this work done by a pro outfit as the results here demonstrate, the car looks totally amazing! Congrats Mat.👏😀👍🦦
Mat we can see the number pate ;)
Just fenomenal Amazing😍😍😍
Why not Topaz detailing 🧐
You ruined it with childish details.
we need a car collection video
the car looks like a model
You're not spelling it correctly man, c'mon. UK you must say Porschhhhaaaaa LOL
That looks incredible
you doing it yourself is making this video boring to me👎👎. you're to clumsy and nervous all the way.
Actually, the license plate reveal was at 19:45 😅anyways, amazing car
19:16 number plate is visible mat!!!
It's a beautiful car, with good insight, but why time - it's about quality, surely & fantastic video.
Number plate reveal before the number plate reveal 😆 Badass car tho 👌🏾
why didn’t you do it at yiannimize
Matt did you buy this to flip it quickly on the used market? If so, values won’t hold up for long.
Sporty doing new things!
17:37 Still has a bit of blue sticker left on the brake pedal…
That's a fantastic motor Mat, no wonder you did a wee jig when you saw it. Winning!!!
Where’s Yianni?
You spoiled the number plate but the car looks incredible. Seeing you enjoy it so much is why us car guys do it.
Satin all the way! everything in Xpel satin wrap looks badass!
They did a amazing job!
Looks sick. But you ruined the number plate reveal because you showed it on the video earlier with out its cover
Should of gone to your mate, Yianni. He's going to be pissed.
But why change the colour
Mat morphing into Shmee
I wonder how Matt is with a condom? He's a dad isn't he? Says a lot. 😅😅😅
Envy personified. Vicarious viewing.
PPF wrap is important for a car like that.
You launched my Urus so time to let me have some fun with you car now! It’s only fair….
Poor Yianni Why
Just the Perfect Spec!
10 Minute Gang.
Hello, dear Matt, my name is Egor, I'm from Russia, I live in St. Petersburg, I work and earn little, maybe give me a car please, thank you!
Love the spec ❤
FFS! Just drive it
Absolute beauty ❤
Ello
7:45 I just remembered Mat Armstrong
Seen the plate before the unveiling 😅
@18:34 Mat's Australian cousin?😄
The car looks stunning Mat!!😍
Cars looking good Mat
Mat, a day keeps the doctor away
Gt3 rs👌👌
Look sick
I literally opened Youtube and saw it has only been 9 seconds!!😂😂 BTW Love your videos Mat!! Congratulations on your new GT3 RS!!❤❤
Why haven't you taken your car to Yannimize
PPF wrapping is 100% worth it, especially when spending on a car as much as a GT3 RS. We protect our 1500 dollar phones with protectors and cases, why not our cars.
Like right away
blupp
Wow what a beast of a machine! 🔥🔥
It looks so sick!
Gr8 video mat hope to see new cars coming in to ur garage ❤❤😅 sick car
