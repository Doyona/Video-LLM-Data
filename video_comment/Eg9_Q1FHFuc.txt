educated, simple and humble.... I love this guy
Great convo
He is very smart, ote, twi ne brofo nyinaa yie. I love him because a lot of People relate to this song Akokoa.
Smart guy, he makes you own his songs after listening... perhaps he's a poet.  by the way 😂 UPS legon once had a famous teacher like that (the legendary Mac Jordan Amartey of blessed memory )...can assure y'all that they're not always nice...especially with the cane...! C real perhaps remember!
I was wondering if the host would like to know the whole story, because this guy speaking very slow
I see why the guy is good with his English formulation. Great Safo Newman
I don't know what to say again, may almighty God direct u to your helpers, already sarkodie have done the remix❤ but we need more top artists to build him up
The Lighthouse Family genre comes to mind
This guy is singing songs that’ll be timeless for ever.
I wish to see Safo go all the way up.
He speaks good English
Generational
He is an intelligent man, no cap on that 💯
Bro I just love you
Is it only me adey see or his aura sef be someway he talks like he’s gon die a second chale
I saw him on tiktok singing that song and didn't know he owns it
His mannerism is just like Manifest's grandfather Prof Nketia.
Reincarnated youngman. He is  very deep spiritual person.
He is just phenomenal. Deep young man
Beautiful ❤️😍😍😍
I saw this guy for the first time in 2022 on Kessben TV, Mr. Bone's show and his songs were deep. He hasn't changed.
Is he the son of Pentecost chairman Opoku-Onyinah?
This guy is narrating my experience I had with my uncle’s wife
Am happy for him. Go higher bro 🔥🔥🔥🙏

This guy has something powerful. I wish to see him go all the way on God.
Please let’s all help and support him ! He’s really good and deserves to be part of the mainstream artist
Safo Newman,Blacko n d guys from Richie's stable; Eugene, Kidi b crazy good!
His voice is super dope
But this guy has suffered a lot 😔
Too talented and wise. He will go far. Safo Newman the whole world is behind you.
Bro everything will be fine ❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I really love Safo ❤❤❤
He is from my home town...❤❤❤. So happy for you my son. Am your Queen Mother
Please, the word is a typical Twi word "AKOKOA NOT AKOKUA" . Let's not spoil our own language. By the way, good work, my fam.
This guy just teleported into our generation, God he’s good🔥
Tusa is mostly back of coconut which are most used for fiber used in bio fill toilet and also used on top of powder gun
He should be a little more confident and audible u can be that and be humble
Great vocals
Wow DA GUY GOT pure Reasoning and Down to Earth ... Will go Far
@3music  sarkodie also have a song called mile 7 saga,  it also talk about same story safo Newman is preaching
He is teacher that’s why he speaks good English. And I like his composure during the interview
This guy is talented and I wish him all the best. I'm being very honest, listening to him is very tiresome cos his speech is a bit too slow, in as much as I appreciate his intelligence and all its still very 'boring' listening to him
Obuoba J A Adofo Junior paaoo....take your flowers my guy🎉
This is Pure Akan and Ayisi demma style
Aaah so the guy is not a small guy eeee ?
Educated young man
He's an incarnate trust me! At his age? Naaaaaaaaaaa! His pen game is like my uncle who thought me about writing in the Fanti language and his thought process isn't from our time!
Media houses in Ghana, seek new artistes. Not when they go viral first. Akokoa came in 2023 - yet he's now blowing up. Vim Newman!
Sarkodie has to do a remix to this song.
He is a light 💡 🕯️
This guy is something herrr let’s push him
He is good  Go higher Safo
He reminds me of General Mosquito 😂😂
Speaks Elective English and Elective Twi 💯
I really  love how the lady ask questions and smiles.
Things that we would use years to say, safo has made it simple for us❤❤
This is his first biggest interview so he’s nervous but as time goes on he will master everything 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ big up bro , the sky is the starting point
This guy is lyrically gifted  He should use Akokoa as his stage name
I love his songs  🎵  very sensible songs
Another Phobia talent ❤
I LIKE HIM BUT HATE HOW HE SPEAKS.... He should speak up a bit ... slow saaa no ad3n...ah
God bless you 3Music...
Highly inspirational and deep.
I like how he's still wearing the same beanie he's been wearing in all his videos
May be he should be like akwaboah and write songs for people… perhaps do a collaboration with akwaboah or obrafuo he will go farrrrr
Safo Newman to the whole world 👍👍👍🙏🏾🙏🏾Amass phobia
I see Nana Ampadu in this young man
Greatness
Oh wow … 🎉 Real Guy ❤
Blessed guy, let’s support him ❤️
He really knows what is doing
He is Not a new comer…Reincarnated 🏴🔥🔥🔥
Profound talent 🎉❤🎉
Y’all trying to put too much pressure on this lad, His pen game is top notch but he’s not built for the cameras  Zero charisma  💯 pure talent
Cosmos,eii my School
This is so deep
This guy is not from this generation he is a time traveler look at how composed he is speaking wisdom
NYB_LIVE can't be left out
He should focus on music writing ✍️ we shouldn't push this guy to become a musician I don't think he is built for that.
He speaks so well
❤️🫶🏿
Talent 💯🙏🏾
I watched him doing afro beat too This guy is too talented
He has a good deep voice. He speaks well. Tecknocrat ampa
