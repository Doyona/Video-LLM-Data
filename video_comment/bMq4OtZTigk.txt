Atleast i have a reason to survive my MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS till end next year!! Thanks ROCKSTAR!!!!!
99 details is that the game is always delayed.
Then we need a Dexter mod

Will there be transgender NPCs? Asking for nefarious reasons
Is that the i-4 eye-soar @ 4:35 ? 😂
This is not GTA 6 this graphics are old lower quality
It would fire 🔥 if the news  clips show live events and you can go outside and be apart of or actually witness
Love it! 17:09 The Germanic-sounding beer name would be pronounced in Germany as "Pisswasser Nein", nearest translation, "Pisswater No" 🍻
I hope we could go to jail and do sum time 😂😂
MegaMundo News is Telemundo lol
Uhm... i first flew dodo in gta 3 actually
Nahhhh not the yellow car at ocean view 🤯🤯🤯
lol at calling pißwasser pibwasser
that does not look like an air traffic control tower behind the vice airport sign
lol at using a screenshot from MS flight sim for the real fat albert blimp pic
Btw it is not piBwasser, it is piss wasser
What do you think we need for the max graphics and high fps requirement of gta6
we need hella properties like san andreas and a FEW fuckin mansions
Found a ps6 in the video
Looking gorgeous and I can't wait for the release date but the big question - will my humble PC with a Ryzen 5700+RTX 3060ti and 32 GB of RAM be able to run this game or will I need to upgrade to a much more powerful CPU ?
Better have wheel support function
Now delayed for 2026. BUT YA KNO. That is fine. Just make it amazing, idc how many delays it takes. It better be awesome!
Well technically I been waiting for this PC release now for a WHILE - was hoping it was coming to PC in 2026, but if they DON"T then I am not buying it - since they delayed the console release by a year why should that delay the PC release?
13years
What if Tommy Vercetti had a son, and that son fights to reclaim his father's lost drug empire? With the help of some old friends from Vice City.
Who is here after trailer 2!!
Here after the second trailer
Dear Americans The german letter „ß“ is not a „B“. It‘s basically just „ss“. So the pronunciation of Pißwasser is actually „PiSSwasser“ and not „PiBwasser“. This way, the joke that Rockstar Games is trying to do here, starts to make sense. „Piss-water“; the beer smells like piss…  Btw. The german word „Pisse“ is actually not written with the letter „ß“. There‘s a grammatical rule, when to use this letter.
Here after trailer 2
Who else is here after watching the second trailer
Who’s here after trailer 2
imagine how high the number will be now after trailer 2 just dropped
waiting for this kind of commentary for the 2nd trailer that just came out
NO TF THEY DIDNT LMFAO THEY GOT FL STUDIO BEAT MAKING IN GTA6 LMFAO
Do you know why are you here ?   "Just watched trailer 2 I guess..
The new trailer2 just dropped 2hrs ago 🎉
Who's here after trailer 2
its been 84 years
I hope the year goes by fast
GTA 6 trailer two JUST DROPPED! 🎉
ANOTHER ONE
a new trailer came
Best B-Day present ever
This is not GTA 6 That is too poor GTA 6 will be much better
The fact that Lucia wears an electronic tag is actually genius because it means you can not just book a ticket and leave Vice City, so that justifies why you can not use the airport.
Make that 100 details as the game delayed until 2026 may 26th 😂
16:23 S41t Stick 3000??? That’s a weapon? Better than what I first thought? Well actually, no no it’s not! 16:23
12:55 Why make it specifically a ‘International’ Airport?  They have stuck with so many names; why change the Airports? and there is so many aircraft spotted in this there has to be domestic Airports… so could the long awaited UK repeat be part of what makes 6, 6!!!! you know? Who knows even others like Rockstars rebuilt Ukraine Map equivalent? Even with all the upspec we see here; there is more than enough to run three separate map/ countries? 12:55
Who bets Trumps Loony Tunes of Deviants ban this for being to much of their liking for others to be allowed it?2😂
This game is ONLY for those that love death and their own demise and destruction, no one else.
Better than what  "DreamWorld" promised as "the last game ever played".
13:17 if you look closely you can see from windows I hope that we can now finally enter
10:56 the left one seems to be a man
we gonna be driving 15 miles just to get somewhere in this game
Did tommy had a son ?.. the guy resembles him
Who’s here after the official delay until may 26th 2026
Hope for more mission  better pay
yey😢 for may 2026
We wouldn't have GTA 6 if it weren't for that one guy dude...props to the hacker
I have a xbox one(base) . I might buy ps5 just for this game.
Hmmm the Weazel news bulletin is 10:34….  Release date CONFIRMED to be October 34th.
You first fly the dodo plane in GTA3 sir
I'm curious how the PS5 will run this and how much space it will take 🤔
sound4sound is definitely a nod to down4sound
imagine they bring hunting and things like that , tag and hunt alligators , that's a big business in lousiana atleast
FLORIDA HAS GATORS NOT CROCS BRUH
When cops gets to you in GTA its not "wasted" We say "busted" for over 25 years. You can literally get arrested in all GTAs
so everyone is black now😕😕
Florida man 🥳, defiantly a good idea for a game
I guess the 919 could be pointing towards something. 😊😊. Let's wait....
"Pibwasser?"  Pretty sure it's pisswasser
Does anyone else think her boyfriend resembles Micheal from gta 5 ?
Still wacting this video 2025 ,Yet rockstar has is still silent 😢
Yall Getting this 2026 Maybe just chill
The dodo was in gta 3.... come on ign!
2:20 buckingham supervolito from gta 5
How t send superchat
Ive seen enough. Give me this unclean gold now!
IGN can't even pronounce BRICKELL
For weather, hopefully they'll have realistic weather like hurricanes
Never Let bro Cook Again 😅
This game is gonna be unbelievable
Brick-kuhl
Ha, Lamborghini went unnoticed!  8:39
Stop saying everything's Lucia when it's not lol
17:08 That's not how you pronounce it and you know it. ß is pronounced as "SS", therefore it's an acronym for urine, which probably reflects it's taste.
언제나와ㅠ
I would probably still play gta V as this game looks like slop
Shit .. hate a lady protagonist.. they shd be side piece
GTA VI will be Game of the century
I really hope Lucia isn’t the main protagonist. I don’t want to have to play as a woman. I’m sure most guys feel the same and 99% of those playing this game will be men.
The map shows the Bermuda Triangle. Wonder if it just like the real
Its been a year already since we had the GTA 6 trailer
great video ign. very intresting. getting me really hyped. thanks.
First 15 sec with guitar and hovercraft..from csi Miami 😅
I hope, that there will be Missions where you are travelling to Las Venturas or San Fierro....
Get your facts straight. The dodo was in GTA III first.
( TIME 3.48 ) DID ANYONE Notice how one of the guys in the bottom right corner is snapping a pic of that girls @$$ as she’s bending ova I legit only just noticed this and I’ve seen the trailer heaps of times
Insanity well done video! Its good to see gta still holds its humour.  Can't wait!!  🤙
Still not out yet 😂😂
Is this the first time gta is going for realism in their characters look? They no longer look  cartoonish like gta 5.
17:08  Pißwasser is German, pronounced piss-wasser (piss water)
Just a heads up, Pißwasser is actually pronounced Pisswasser. The ß is a way of denoting certain 's' sounds in German. Giving this lovely brand of beer the appetising (translated) name of Pisswater
Who's here 2025!!!!! 🎉❤😂
I donno if i wanna blow up on social media that brings the feds
Small detail, but Vice City’s airport is the same runway configuration as Miami International.
imagine they have like dentists so you can get grills, braces, diamonds, etc.
Who's is watching this cos Rockstar taking 2 years release something new
Great detective work , revealing lots of cool details ! Highly appreciated!
18:04 we do know it is Jason
4:00 why were there not more animals in general with GTA games
0:46 korea, sigh
Don’t really care for Lucia. If she’s the main character this game is garbage!
2:17 bottom right corner LMAO
Wow 🤩 This is detailed!!! 😮
The best way to understand GTAVI, is to play Red Dead Redemption 2 !!!
Arthur and Mary reincarnated
11:21 IMHO Chop was one of the most annoying game elements, especially this never working mobile app, i always tried avoiding all of franklings chop missions except those from the main story, the stock market was a much better way to get money than those annoying walk the dogsht....
peppe (giuseppe pellerito)
Pilot here, at 10:02 you highlighted a structure at the airport- that is not a Air traffic control tower, most likely a radar emplacement.
It's a dodge challenger y'all gotta know the difference
Greatest game of all time. Better than rdr2 ofcourse
Bring back midnight club in GTA6
Where is GTA 6?
Best generation ever. We get only game trailers for last 5 years, no new great ps5 or zbox game.
*Pisswasser
Cause she's got an ankle monitor I bet she will only be limited to a certain part of the map for a period of time
7:47
Aaaaand I'm back here in February 2025.....
I hope we get to go on the Everglades.  Edit. We do. That’s so cool 😂
hmm ithink 200-250 gb...after all updates 300
10 years and they will change color  on a sports bike 😂 its embarrassing how they rob kids and parents money.
I really hope for GTA7 we can go to other countries🕺
3:10 twin towers in gta 6 😈
I’m so excited for vice city tbh. There was a 7 year gap between 3 and 4s Liberty City, and 9 year gap between GTA SA and 5’s Los Santos….   23 years between Vice City and 6. I wonder how those iconic spots will look.
Are we not going to talk about the different states as license plates
Random detail but it would be cool if car windows fogged up when it's cold out in this game I dont think I have ever seen a game do this
Speaking of prison, when i was in prison in Texas i had a job at the back gate for awhile. I was outside the gate picking up trash one day and a horse that belonged to one of the guards came up to me and kept nudging me with his head. He was trying to tell me to get on him and ride him 😂. I was like "oh hell nah, bro. Youre trying to get me shot" lol. The guard tower was right there and the guard was watching me with a rifle already in hand. Smart horse though, for sure.
This will be amazing
i hope we can do fishing bowling tennis football and basketball in gta 6
Bro how is this already a year ago 💀🙏😭
True💯♥️🎬
8:40 Micheal's car black found!
the shore line is a good drive by massacre with bus or truck
9:14 is a keys landmark it looks like that’s the  7 mile bridge
being from miami and hearing brick elll and the bridge comment was funny lol
1 year later.. still waiting for 2nd trailer!!!
Detail abroad about gta wives and girlfriend wars hidden closeted peep at boss cheats Detail the tail in reference to owning her ass.
Remember games just get developed as years go by GTA 7 if it's made may be better than GTA 6 so there is no comparison between GTA San Andreas or GTA 5 and GTA 6 there all got developed
Vice City again.. cant get more bored... Always the Same theme....Vice City IS Just a east coast Los Santos...
Glad I didn’t see this video until 2025 😂now I’m not impatient
Rockstar should add pacfic oceans to this game also 😊😢
i wish cars will use fuel.
If there isn't atleast one Dexter reference then this game is a dud
Having a social web on your phone would actually be sick
man i cant wait ....and im on pc
I really hope they will contain all these NPCs in the final game, not just like a very few strolling around like its the case in V.
Pisswasser ẞ is sss not a B 😊
In the articles we come across or that trailer scene of car flipped at Hwy exit/on ramp and I retired from retail [during covid, grocery store] to now traffic flagger I like how npcs are more interactive.
gta 6 basically have the gráfics of rd2
In GTA 7 I'm  hoping everyone who's playing will have a different experience...because of AI 🙏
This game is gonna be 500 GB i swear
The "B" in PiBwasser is German for a double "s". Pisswasser... Wasser is water.
Who would not buy this game?
The sheer number of NPCs is going to be insane 😂
Well now I won’t have to spend 100s to visit Florida for the first time
That TV tower reminds me another movie😂
This game gonna be awsome
Just think you jump off that tower and pull your chute and they have it sometimes fail. Then you have to cut off and pull a reserve. That would be a cool  touch
The year is here. I can't believe, now i can look at all the facts and details
Wait...If I play this I am  girl?
Maybe Lucia has an electronic bracelet, and this will be Rockstar’s way of preventing the player from accessing certain areas of the map, similar to San Andreas.
Why nobody talks about the RR Cullinan ?
9/19/25 will be the date
GTA6 will be amazing on PS7 😂😂😂😂 on PS5 back to the clouds you go!
I can’t wait for the radio station, I always listen Dr. Ray De Angelo Harris and weazel news gta 5
4:07plane
Fr we have been wating for 12 years😢
I see wanted from rdo
I'm leaving the comments until the game drops and then I am gonna come back and watch it one e last time before playing GTA6!!! CANT WAIT 🔥
You don’t pronounce pißwasser as pibwasser but as pisswasser lol
Trailer was released a year ago what ???
@3:45 crocodiles? Really, from an American?
cant wait for 2027 to play it on PC
What if thats not even Jason in the first trailer but possibly someone completely different lol
Crazy 2025 and still PC can't get a copy on the first release just because they want to make money off ppl buying consoles I rly think they be getting a percentage out of the money they make off consoles bc we all know PC got unlimited power n upgrades so why else they don't like looking out for PC
Whose here in 2025
Pißwasser is german. Translated Peewater
is it only first person view
Absolutely cool❤😂
This made me even more excited for this game
Will the add yatch for us to buy agian if there is ima gonna buy it and set sail like the one we’re the stunt jump bridge is
omg omg omg omg omg
Wow. Is this a game or movie. My mind cant get it 😮
Now imagine playing this game in VR. im telling you guys this game will be the most insane video game ever made.
Stay away from this game.  It's plagued by wokeness and propaganda.
18:01 it's Jason
17:09 it's german. That wasn't an "b" "ß" is actually "s" so you would say "Pisswasser" not "Pibwasser". And that "Nein" below it is obviously german for "no" since Pisswasser means peewater in english.
these scenes in Miami remind me of nfs Heat
Why is no one appreciating IGN here ? This is a really well done video capturing every little detail correctly. Good work IGN!!
I expect the game will not live up to the hype. The trailer doesn’t look particularly interesting aside from the graphics. Uninteresting playable characters. And they’re gonna make us play as a GIRL. So lame.
I just realized that the pawn and gun might be able to sell valuables maybe stolen off of npcs like red dead redemption 2
Everyone is in doubt of Playstation 5 Pro rendering GTA6 60fps@4k....Everyone seems to forget that Rockstar was already developing the game around base PS5.With the trailer looking this good imagine now having upgraded hardware and Mark Cerny's involvement i think we all have a pretty good chance of experiencing the game that will exceed our expectations.
My god time really does fly and here i am thinking that i saw the GTA 6 trailer ealier this month when in fact it was a year ago around the same month....you dont realize time has pass until u look at the numbers 😮
9:28 Hair technology... right... 🤣
i can guarantee rockstar will remove some assets that were shown in the original trailer, like how they did on gta v. the original trailer is completely different from the released game now
And gta 6 is set in the southern part of the us they going add Georgia Alabama Mississippi Carolina and Tennessee I will like this game if they add my home state
I’m from Duval (Jacksonville, Florida) so I’m truly excited for this one… being a Floridian.
But we didn’t notice there small kids and teenagers only adults?
Th even added homeless people to make it more reliastic 😅
I saw dogs on GTA V and GTA Online... they attacked me.
December 27th Theory Guys 😂
In the mud in the trailer you can see kids playing
Can’t believe I’m gunna have to buy a ps5 just for this game.
This game will be epic.
"Angst" is gearman for "fear"
18:52 Real ones know it was on RADIO K-DST, THE DUSSSSTTTT
8:35 Buddy, that's a Challenger
It must’ve taken 8 years to make the trailer and 2 years to make the game
Ankle bracelet ❌ Electronic tag✅
And we're STILL waiting... for trailer 2 at this point.
17:39 prince andrew
I’d never thought I’d be hyped about a video game at the age of 40 but I’m definitely hyped about GTA 6 and by the time GTA 7 is even announced I’d probably be in my early or mid 50s.
I never thought at the age of 40 I would be hyped to play a game but damn I really wanna play this game please rockstar stop making us wait so long. It’s agonizing…. By the time they announce GTA 7 I would probably be in my late 50s
My guess would be, that this is a bonnie and Clyde Story and you Can Pick either the male or female protagonist and the other one will follow you as npc
Its not Pibwasser it’s Pißwasser. ß is the German exclusive letter pronounced like a sharp s. So it’s Called Pisswasser. Wasser ofc means water.
Did IGN just call those alligators*crocodiles*? Wtf man
It’s pronounced pissvasser
1 year old 😮
Who's here on 1 year anniversary?
Correction @18:50 :  Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream" was featured on the San Andreas "KDST" radio station, not in Vice City.
well im gonna cause ww3 in gta 6
im here on 04/12/24
@10:03 that is NOT an air traffic control tower. Lol. It is airport radar though so… right answer, wrong formula
the B in PIBWASSER in German sounds like SSSS.... wasser in german is Water....... i . e. Pisswater
3:20 gta 6 gonna have Bermuda Triangle 😂😂
the super yacht (7:30 right under tommy vercetti's house) looks like the Colonel Juan García Cortez's motor yacht from gta vc.
For me , i was really waiting for a real map , like to have a map for Los santos , san fierreo , liverty city , vice city , las venturad all in one  The ability to travel from city to another same as san andreas ( after unlocking few missions in the other areas ) and maybe even the ability to travel for north yankton For 10 years if waiting i guess rockstar could really do it in a way even if the game graphics and capacity were large well it worth it
im actually worried about not having much to do. cuse in vice city for ps2....the state is SMALL. your not really turning left or right..just going straight forward. plus it really wasn't much to travel nd really explore. i would like for rockstar to bring back when you couldn't go across the bridge due to a major construction so you gotta complete enough missions in that ONE part of thestate to unlock the other part across the bridge
CAN WE PLEASE GET THE WARRIORS FIGHTING MECHANICS I KNOW YALL STILL RUN 9 v 9 WHILE MAKING 6
ß =/= B  ß = ss  So it's pisswasser
ß is a german symbol which is pronounced as ss. In the video you said pibwasser when it really is pißwasser which means pisswater in English.
17:08 its called "Pisswasser", thats the bavarian word for a bad tasting bear.
Am playing the waiting game rn lol
harita her zaman USA dan olmak zorunda değil dünya üzerinde harika manzaraları olan şehirler var onları tasarlayın .
Runnin' Down a Dream was in San Andreas not in Vice City ;)
17:09 it’s not pibwasser, it’s pißwasser, ß is an equivalent of an S sound
17:09 pibwasser is crazy :skull:
They Elder Scrolls 6 might take longer
9 year old me couldnt of conceived what gta would turn into.
Jesus Christ is Lord
Pibvasser is pronounced "piss-vasser", the joke is that it's piss water, the sharp s in german looks like a b in English.
I love these photos however I can't help but think flying bikes with rocket launchers will soon ruin everything!
30 advertisements before seeing your content 😂😂😂 wow what a ride.  ADHD much?
Watching this video again nearly a year later. Pls just drop the game already rockstar
I was too young to understand the references in vice city. Escobar airport is wild lol
روكستار انتظرنا طويلا لا اريد ان القي الضغط التوقعات مرتفعة تعيشوا مع الضغط تحياتي .
نسخة pc ستعطيك خيارات متعددة للرسوم واختيار الوحدة المفضلة والمتجر المفضل بين steam وepic 😊😊😊
فقط نصيحة مثلا جربت gta 5 على كلا المنصتين كل منصة اعطتني تجربة مميزة ومختلفة 😮😮😮
الخيار الممتاز هو تجربتها على المنصتين والاستفادة من مميزاتهما معا😮😮😮
xbox élite 2 خيار جيد ايضا للعب gta6
فقط سؤال هل ستستغل اللعبة خصائص،duelsence
الخبر المفرح ان xbox series s سيشغلها 😊😊😊
اعزاءي المتابعين فقط سؤال لن تجيبوني عليه أن ستلعبون gta 6 نسخة pc متأخرة.
اطمءنوا اعزاءي القناة مستمرة ادعو الله ان تسدد المستحقات .
للاسف 😢😢😢 بسبب البث اليوم كامل لن استطيع لعب اللعبة مدة طويلة .
متحمس جدا للعبة انتظر صدورها بفارغ الصبر .
I hope we be able to customize motorcycles....Stretching them with rims💯
so exited for the different cars we are going to have here.
I’m so hyped about the law enforcement, since it seems like they are doing it the correct way this time unlike how they did it in gta 5 with lssd using two counties. For a 2 billion dollar game, I’m kinda expecting them to go all out with making the police realistic, maybe we might get to see national guards/military return in a 6 star wanted level alongside fib, u.s marshals, noose, local police and county sheriffs.   Idk man, I just want it to be huge.
Lucia is gonna be the Sadie Adler of gta 6
Lucia is gonna be the Sadie Adler of gta 6
I so hope they take inspiration from Just Cause 4 and add tornadoes into the game that would be sickkkk
I hope that the car customization is like how it was in Midnight Club Los Angeles, where you can edit rim sizes, and add hella stickers and stuff
The only thing im excited about is the highway
The ß in Pißwasser is spelled s not b
I’ll love to go snorkeling with the dolphins!❤ 2:03
What about us pc guys????????????????????????
It is very difficult to earn money and will we be a mafia leader, poker master, pizza maker, bartender or a restaurant, hotel or nightclub owner? We can also start a street meatball business to earn money and start a business and invest, or we can get paid to look after dogs and pets, or it is difficult to earn money and if life is difficult, we can commit crimes and rob banks, or we can be an honest person and become a police officer. We will all see this when the game comes out. I am very excited.
9:50 i am not looking at her face
Possible delay....truly diabolical....😅😅😅😅
18:50 The song "Runnin' Down a Dream" was actually featured on GTA San Andreas' soundtrack on K-DST. Tom Petty's "Full Moon Fever" album released in 1989. Vice City took place in 1986.
In look at i see a fucking banshee
With holeshot in all
Need to add a 4-wheeler banshee
For the people that keep saying that gta 6 Will let you customize Ur own home and buy Any home what I think is there are only a few homes and all you can do is choose upgrades people would Make weird stuff with custom  builds
prediction alert jason or lucia will be a undercover cop leading to a betrayal i feel like it could be jason because lucia seems to be more of the main character and lucia has been in jail but it  could also be lucia as she could have been put undercover in the jail to get street cred so she can infiltrate in to gangs
i hope we can own businesses like we can in gta 5 but i hope there is more interactivity to them kinda like gta online but not as much also i hope we can buy houses and apartments in gta 6 story mode
I can't wait for twerk physics
Rdr2 is top level imagine what this is
Alligators*
Ufff!!! That is an amazing breakdown and hats off to R⭐️ for creating experiences and not just games.
Why is everyone missing the releasedate in the trailer??
Would be more awesome if the story is like gta 4
"Pibwasser". The 'ß' is pronounces as an 's' in German. So, Pißwasser is pronounced Pisswasser.
GTA has come a long way since 1997. 💯
I will never grow up I love gaming and sports and food and friends lol
Lucia's partner/ the male protagonist is Jason. (from what was found in the 2022 leak) which makes sense
Please note; Brickell… it’s not “Brick-elle-“ .. it’s Brickell! like “pickle”!
They’re basically going to RDR2 the hell out of GTA Vice City
Been hangin out for GTA6 since the first day I played GTA5, we all know graphics always improve over time so this is a given and of course exciting, but the only main main main thing I am looking forward to and I do hope with every cell in my body, is that the map is at minimum twice the size of GTA5, and I do hope that is only minimum, until processing power grants us enough memory to create GTA games of global countries to explore instead of just a city.
Nice breakdown. This game will take  customers from all other games hands down
still no sign of the 2nd trailer
I hope they fix the wind and hair physics soon, it irks me to see it move the same way all the time.
I know I’m gonna be posted up in the hood like a crack on a curb when this drops….
That defunct bridge is the old key west bridge.
I hope we can ride horses in gta 6
Black Mith Wukong
You can write it on your page! rockstar is always lying by a reallistic gameplay but when we see bottom dollar dlc or the only the choice of a company no one is legal anymore the tow-mission! I dont want to be a cop or a criminal i just wanna have fun!! But no rockstar give hate to his users and they dont do anything with that! They give me back a answer like: we make a value just like in real life for your item but in real life i can sell my stuff like home or anything like that but bottom dollar cannot be refound or disable from my game just like i ask and no earasable in my game! Like i said they just want to give hate to user to sell something fake!
For me i see the big details for giving any idea for the gta6 look rockstar game studio they going to scrapp these video game and im absolutly sure about it  jsut look on little detail bottom dollar on gta online you gonna see it!
Jason might be an undercover cop so maybe the pov is jason arresting lucia or someone else
people still say hes looking for the hundrend detail
Someone should educate you on recognizing certain characters. That guy with the bandana on is an older Franklin and thats lamar next to him.
I have to earn money
IGN GTA online Moonless_union2 or 3 great vid
2025 - The world is worried about World War 3. Everyone born after 2000 wants to escape into VR Gaming. GTA in 2025 is the perfect escape from the real world.
99 Details from a 90 second trailer is insane.  🔥
You're amazing!!
17:02 who the fuck is gonna wanna play as a female????
17:02 who the fuck is gonna wanna play as a female????
13:35 red is for Crips😂
in the clip of the people on the beach, if you looking in the background, one of the buildings looks like the I-4 eye sore
GTA VI really should have been a continuation of Michael and Trevor's story.
who thinks gta 5 started to feel empty after watching this level of detail in gta 6
GTA 6 is going to be a disappointment, for a game that took over a decade to come to console.
9:14 looks like the 7 Mile bridge from real life
It’s brickle not briquel
YOOOO PLEASE LET US HAVE A DOGGO IN GTA!!!
Cant wait for it
Hope you will be able to fill your car with petrol on this one
Damn thick
whats the background music .... press like to put pressure on ign😅
So hyped for this game!
price for game 300euro for sure 😂😂
Imagine a two player option where the two players can play as Lucia and her unknown partner…
Its Pisswasser (ss=ß) not Pibwasser
People watching this in 2025 👇
What is the release date for GTA VI please
THIS IS NICE AND ALL, BUT WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET SLEEPING DOGS 2? THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES I'VE PLAYED.
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE <3
I’m hoping for a wider world once this does gta online. Please include nyc and San Fran as places we can go to 😩
"Pibwasser." Dude. Learn a bit of German.
Fun fact if you left this on Auto loop 350,400 times it would be Sep 2025 and we’d be right around the corner from Release.
is FishingGarret there in Gta 6?
10:07
17:08 Its not spelled pibwasser its spelled pisswasser which is german also below its written Nein (No in german). Great video by the way.
"which of course is the place upon which vice city is based" bro got some bars 🔥🔥🔥🔥
13:57 pls tell me am not the only one who sees the kids playing in the mud 😭😭
Hope the pc release date comes soon. Ill still be buying it on ps5 tho
The broken bridge at 9:14 looks like Old Channel #5 Bridge North, next to Overseas Hwy.
😮😮
the mall bouttta go hard loll
We need wingsuit😅
15:05 nobody peeped how that state police cars are dodge challengers
bro 8 months ago already is insane
There’s going to be so many Easter eggs and mysteries to unpack too
Pißwasser is pronounced "Pisswasser"
08:20 I'm calling it, that's Dr Dre's car.
17:25  u can see a clear flag of kosovo 🇽🇰
We need a bigger map
just thinking about it makes me sad gta 5 will probaly be remasterd in the future
Will gta6 have online right when it drops
Just imagine if Rockstar games wouldn't have existed and GTA neither
What gta need now is a noise pollution on the streets.
If there’s really this much detail and graphics, this is going to be a laggy game
Well you be able to open the back of Semi truck trailers in gta 6?
I’m very disappointed that it won’t take place in the 80’, 90’s or even the early 2000’s. Not even looking forward to it anymore.
This is it?
ah so that means us pc players gotta wait till 2026 for gta6 at least? bummer
I’m absolutely fiending to get my hands on this game
That's Jim Caviesel. Unmistakable nose and voice.
for those who don't know sessanta nove is italian for 79
8:42 calling a homeless dude a ‘wild person’ is insane💀💀
Bermuda triangle is on the map 💀💀
Rockstar really need to partner with SRT and a lot of these other car companies
You say it as pisswasser
GTA VII - coming in 2070
This was really well done! Nice work, IGN!
it's pissssssswasser
pisswasser not pitwasser
Bre-kel lol It's Brick-L
>:(
At 14:00 it suggests our characters actually get dirty and could need showers
best game
That bridge on 09:12 will never  be done 😂 we all know that by now 😂
PLEASE let GTAVI be like GTAIV only with: A bigger MAP, better GRAPHICS and more aditional ACTIVITIES.
Over ten years since the last installment.  At this point it’s shameful. In the same amount of time (97’ to 08’) they put out gta, gta 2, gta 3, gta vice city, gta San Andreas, and gta4. Also this is twice as long as gta 4 to 5 (08’-13’)…  🖕🫵🪨⭐️
To think the actors and actresses have such a unique experience with this, they know what hundreds of millions don’t, and their apart of something so massive
Make it 100
Its just a Trailer, everone how think NORMAL know this dont Show the Real Game, so this is not true
Vice city will be a 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴 game
Pibwasser? Seriously?
we thought rdr2 was crazy, gta6 will be insanity, hard to imagine how rockstars next big game release is gonna be
9:28 yeah, the hair... the hair is astonishing, the attention is being drawn on the hair :-D
Calling a sitting half-dead looking beggar a "wild person" made me chuckle :P :D
You got all that from a one minute thirty second video? Dude you must possess some sort of super power or something
lucky are those who will play this as their first Gta ever
Why im so addicted to watching gta 6 details
18:30 no love for the shocker sticker??
14:10 that's definitely not a liberator, looks more like a jacked up F-350
Rockstar knows how to make games 🎉
just think about the money that rockstar made from gta 5 and red dead 2 you will know gta 6 is gonna be huge
Thanks for this video. It made me realize how much detail there is to see in places you’d least expect it. A small correction though: It‘s Pisswasser, not Pibwasser.
No kids in gta 6 you've got to be kidding me.
16:48 "raised by rideout customs" Lift kits finally?!
14:03 that is actually a sandking XL with a liberator paint scheme, as the gta 5 liberator uses a vapid SUV shell
This game will be rdr2 but better and modern
One of them is definitely a cop.
So, it's set in California, has a brown female woman of colour as a protagonist and I'm constantly told "it's the current year".   I'm already 50% not interested.
Plese Warning 11:18 "RAVEN"???????
At 16:10 you can see the banshee from gta 5 in the background
Incredible breakdown.
Will lucia have menstrual cycles? If so will it affect gameplay?
5:38 look at those pelicans
In the mud scene it’s kids playing in the mud 💯👀
For some reason my comment keeps getting deleted
Secret places in gta 6
My GTA5 Online character (created in 2018) has the same clothes as Lucia at 1:47 . Coincidence ? Details...
Mine comment got deleted
It ain’t a croc it’s a gator
Pity your being forced to play as the fools who are the problem today
F***ing just bring it out already, I'm getting the DTs just waiting😆
Yall don’t see dat green Lamborghini next to the Porsche onna side
running down a dream song was in gta san andreas, not vice city
The leg tags might be what Rockstar will use to stop people from leaving the playable area
You’ve missed so many it’s unreal
What about ps4?
Another girl boss? Shieeeet
That Pink Donk @6:06 is Hard AF..
Not to nitpick but that was a challenger not a charger
99 details and he forgot the jiggle effect 😅
What would you guys think of an online social media in the online mode of gta 6? Imagine getting famous in a game through a a game 😂
"Liberator monster truck" more like 17 tons of pure democracy
Jason and lucia
Hello......
NAHHH IMAGINE IF MICHAEL FRANKLIN AND TREVOR WAS LIKE LESTER BUT IN GTA6 XD
GTA is gaming done right! ❤
We all forgot Bermuda's Triangle is next to  it and we will see some crazy stuff   going on there
Pißwasser is pronounced pisswasser
when GTA 6 finally releases, most will play it on PC  those who already have an xbox or PS5 will play it on console
nice
For GTA VII give us all 3 maps so we have reasons to use the airport
When the game launch people will notice 90% of the details will be missing.
It would be nice to get some normal looking houses. Not everyone wants a life in luxury and would rather have a nice cabin in the woods.
Allow us to buy homes & better cars , in gta 6 .
Anyone wanna tell him this is all CGI and not using game engine?
2090: gta 6 online is out
“piBwaser” lmfao
yoou forgot the kids
StarCitizen still better and it's 10+ years old LOL
Damn i‘m hyped to get GTA6
Multiple state map for gta online would be dope. All old maps combined with a few new ones added
It’s pissvasser!
1:49 could've said Busted instead of Wasted.
Im so glad im not seing any blue hairs so far
Pibvasser????
My clan in GTA V online is IGN
What about mobile?
cant wait for the cop chases hope they can ligit keep up tho
There has to be a PC release at some point. PC’s can handle more than an Xbox series X/S and PlayStation 5
Should the "ida" in Leonida" be pronounced the same as the one in "Florida"?
imma kill every chiwawua
What a thumbnail its not even detailed edited the sleeves of the man dosen't match the sleeve of the character in the poster
GTA5 Had two counties Los Santos County and Blaine County so it makes sense gta6 would have more than 2.
We need John bertinell in a GTA game but do that plays Shane in The walking Dead
This will be the best game ever
For those guessing. Jason is an undercover cop. So we will do both crimes (as undercover) and police missions. At the end of the game we will have to choose between betray Lucia and finish our undercover mission (drugs) or join her (cuz we felt in love), but then we will end up being a criminal. Game will end as we fly to the south america.
2027 😉
Heck, yeah Tom Petty better be getting money For them to be putting his songs in the games
10:58 you can see the GO Postal Logo from GTA5
Was really hoping it wasnt going to be a florida map
По молКеу шаа
"Runnin down a dream' was on the San Andreas soundtrack.
Imagine they put all this in the trailer but its only for the trailer or mission video scene but no actual play in the game
yokkk
Maybe 200 to 500 GB total game size for this game?
8:50 Homeless person with iguana on his shoulder getting referred to as "wild people" 💀
4:48 is a scene from the 2006 Miami vice movie not the 1984 tv series
First person mode detail?
Pißwasser is pronounced 'PISSWASSER' the funniest beer name in gta ever
17:09 Its not Pibwasser.. It's pisswasser. from German, meaning pisswater.. Nein means no in German..
May 2024 pass really fast so we can all play the goat game in 2025
18:50 "Runnin' down a dream" was on San Andrea's soundtrack not Vice City's
the gold teeth
F-Type* not F12
Imagine if there's no Vercetti mansion reference in GTA VI
Im so excited to explore the game with these new mechanics and graphics.
Series S??? I don’t think so
Go postal is back🔥🔥
6:49 "this jhit enjoying himself" LMAOOO
Lol, it's not PiBwasser. It's Pißwasser. You don't need to understand German to guess how it's pronounced.
That petty forever sticker is a dig at the rainbow movement
You? VI 2025 5 12 🎉 Like 133 rb
how are you gonna talk about Florida and call em crocodiles...
This is just the trailer clip, so imagine with me the full game. We are witnessing an unprecedented era. Thank you, Rockstar
Intel better be ready to release a special processor for this one.
jeff bezos on boat
Runnin down a dream was gtasa
If you look back at the woman with the two hammers you see that Caption says “Neighborhood watch dont play around in Hamlet” so hamlet would most likely be a place
Running down the drain is on San Andreas not Vice City smh
Lucia is Heisenberg????!!!???;????€???)"))?
Maybe this trailer best trailer in the world.
Yeah aliens 👽 are finally arriving to play it 😂😂
December is my birthday
from the deleted uber driver[s leak their names are lucia and jason
its interesting how they are generationally conditioning through 'militarized modern Pavlovian' subconscious processing .
I’m still not ready to leave Michael Franklin and Trevor though
Love this video, Can't wait for the release of GTA VI
It will be interesting how they do their first female protagonist and it makes me wonder if they will implement some of rdr2's features for weapons like customization or maintenance
"pibwasser"
the game might start by her boyfriend breaking her out
Wrong tom petty's running down a dream wasnt on vice city, it was on k-dst san andreas!
Can’t wait to floor it in a car through that beach
its not pibwasser its pißwasser -> pisswasser
Still one detail. The dent on the car back door in the end of the video which was fine at first we’ve seen it.
The girl in the pool can't be Lucia because Lucia has more moles on her face and the scene inside the car shows this
u missed a black guy wearing airpods on the beach. The guy is behind the guy taking spicy pics of the girl. He is hlding an orage drink.
Alligators
Dont tell me this game 350gb or highter
Ummmm boys, we have a problem, gta6 productions are falling behind and it highly likely it will be delayed till 2026. Truth from DiscussingFilms
Its cubana lust the main protagonist
hopefully theres a ps4 version of gra6
I'm only interested in this game if it includes the director mode.  I've NEVER played gta5, ive always used director mode...only...
If this from a female perspective this is gonna b fun
suprising you missed the ANTS on the floor
Alligator not crocodile's
This is art, that needs to be appreciated. So much little details
The Thrillbillys looks like a gang that could be located in Alabama
Why do you think Waezle news is a parody of Fox news when the theme is white and red ? CNN is white and red.
When he said piBwasser a little part of me died
And this is JUST a trailer
car model of enus[rolls royce] is also seen . it is just like rolls royce  cullinan
looking forward to find many easter eggs like before in the gta series
6:32  Are we just gonna glide over the car that looks very similar to a lamborghini aventador svj
Imagine playing this game in vr
The BBL's look real asf😂😂😂😂
"Vice-Dale County" is Miami-Dade County, the county that Miami is in.
Pronounced Brick-le not Brickell. Spelled Brickell
Cant wait for it to release im always watching the trailer
It looks like gtav but vl...
Masterpiece, simply stunning
Also in the dollar bills it reads united states of paranoia
dodo first gta 3 , not VC
These games are all fake
Anyone else mad they do not include skateboarding or rollerblading??? Shii even throw in scooters 🛴
The man dies after halfway point
Running down a dream was on San Andreas 🤨
not American, but almost every word with leo in it, followed by a consonant is pronounced as "Leh",  right? you even got Leonard County (leh nard). isn't it possible Leonida ( especially with Florida being a 3 syllable word as well) is pronounced as "Leh Nida" or even "Leh Nuh Da" like "Floh Ruh Da" ? havent heard anyone say it like that yet, but it seems like a possibility.
18:51 Running down a dream was in San Andreas!
Will cleetus mcfarland be in this game ?😂
This was worth waiting 😳
Lets see how many hundreds of gigabyte this game is..
wait what? no gta 6 on pc? dafuq rockstar
10:17 dadbod squad.🤣😂
Damn console first?  Will it at least be on gamepass?
Runnin' down the Dream was featured in GTA San Andreas too!!
Will there be GTA 6 online?
8:37 there is a lambo left of the dodge
Awesome, airboats
Can we carry dual gun in GTA 6?
Is that a green lambo
11:07 don’t forget the background where people are putting gas into their cars
Cant wait to say hello to that little beach ranger with my RPG.
Bring back the original gangs from GTA2
🐾 wut are "dolls" of destruction? 🐾 🎀✨️🔮
Do some better fact checking. Crazy how you forget about gta3.
18:55 Tom Petty’s Running Down A Dream was on San Andreas not Vice City. Anyone interested check out my Florida Joker Parody video on my channel.
GO Postal is also back if you seen on the gas stations scene, above the front door.
Amazing video
Just think around maybe 2060 these graphics will be terrible… crazy
go to my channel and watch 4k games trailer gta 6
Im waiting on the ♾ killer mysteries in gta6 if theres any in it
they better do a London GTA
He would die lol
fantastic breakdown.
When that woman is twerking on top the car, the lyric is, “but love”
Leonida County is definitely a re-creation of Broward County lol
Great work figuring out all these details from a short trailer! Every detail you featured here seemed legit idea.
8:35 its a dodge challenger
8:34 it’s a challenger not a charger.
And I’m the dude jogging in aqua shorts ppfftt lol
I'm going to pre-order & leave it in my will so my grandkids can download it when it finally releases.! 😉 😉
Just think of the possibilities if Rockstar Games did a 5-minute game demo for Grand Theft Auto 6 on a PlayStation 5 Pro and if those rumors of the AI upscaling technology are true.
DAT THUMBNAIL.
Piss wasser wich stands for pisswater.
At 18:28 next to the Tom Petty sticker is that steel panthers the shocker? 🤘🏻
Running down a dream is in san andreas soundtrack not vice city!
Theirs still more details even ign still didn’t notice
Running down a dream was released on San Andreas not Vice city !!!
18:00 We do know his name. The male protagonist is named "Jason" from leaks from like 7 months ago or something around 7 months.
That male character is probably an undercover cop
Bring it on Rockstar!!!! I'm getting old here!!
Tremendous breakdown of the trailer, this looks INCREDIBLE.
IM IN ign GANG IN GTA ONI;LINE
Maaajor Bonnie and Clyde vibes! 🔥
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game going to be awesome just like them all
Honestly we need to be able to go to prison like for a few days… experience the prison, join gangs, and stuff like that better to experience there than irl
LSD
4:48 GTA: Vice City came out in 2002...   Miami Vice (the movie) came out in 2006....
1 detail you've missed is it will be full of modders and glitches and brownstar doesn't care
That bridge of the Keys that’s dilapidated is super accurate. Florida has so many old roads and bridges that are just sitting there, detached from the main roads. I’ve been through a fair amount of the state and seen more than just a couple broken bridges. Super excited.
I’ll love seeing modern society and social media being made fun of
18:51 Wrong -- "Running Down a Dream" was featured in GTA San Andreas not Vice City.
“Pibwasser” 🤦🏻‍♂️
A wad of cash. Back when GTA VC out they couldn't even render fingers.
10:56 Women? Sorry, that's a dude. No women has a chin like that 😂
The bridge looks derliect. So it's a stunt jump
не, ну так-то заебись
Can't wait for you guys to rate this game a 7
The realer these games get, the more I'm convinced we're living in a simulation.
They surely put all the Gta maps togheter.
Does anyone know if the online multiplayer will use AI NPC's?
9:00 that’s seven mile bridge and the broken one next to it is the old seven mile bridge. Does look like you could jump a car on to it but it’s super old irl.
Piß actually came from German meaning Piss. So it’s literally pisswater 😂
8:37 Blud called a dodge challenger a charger😭🙏
Great video but you guys got the cars all kinds of wrong
When is gta 7 coming out ?
Running down the dream was on GTA SA.
try to imaigine to kil somone in gta 6
The girl in the swim suit not Lucia it’s the girl in pink dancing on the car she is a reference to one of the city girls
What about pc gta 6?
Petty's "Runnin' Down A Dream" was featured on K-DST ;)
"PIBWASSER" nah man that is not a B. Its PISSwasser
Awesome video!
To Rockstar games: Shutup and take my money!!!💰💰💰💸
cali held gta 5 down for that decade… now it’s our turn!!!! can’t wait to play in miami
8:40 = The orange car is a dodge calleneger. The blue one infront of the Superfast is a C8 (GTA TERMS C10)
The dirt bike people on the left there are kids playing in the mud
9:11 this will be like the construction work in gta v. it will never be done
They better have blue ark
Very nice. Very thorough!
Its not Pibwaser its Pißwasser. Or Pisswasser. And Pißwasser Nein translated to english means Pisswater  No💀
You guys missed the kids wrestling in the background in the mud kids in GTA VI ?
Rockstar is on another level with the new gta..sorry ur not getting hired bud
Who else saw Jason's car in the dirt bike scene
His name is Jason. Everybody knows that.
Why rockstar only ps5.. release ps4 too please
Jason might be a undercover cop cause that police bust scene your looking through third person. Just my opinion but who gives af
I'm calling a September 19 2025 release date
11:25 pooch
Tommy better still run it
Now we can costumize the size of our characters🎉
Take my dinero
Looks sh!t
.... So now can we get new GTA V single player content? A few new clothes? Some hair styles? Some new activities like arm wrestling? Maybe a night club for single player? What about the casino interior and single player gambling??  Something???! Anything??!!!!!
Auto aim should be OFF!!
Sad news about GTA 6 Tommy Vercetti will most likely  not be in the game since the 3D universe where Tommy,Claudecand CJ are from isn't the same as the HD universe GTA 6 is part of
"Pipwaser" Pronounces "Pisswasser" and is german for Pisswater.
pisswasser
jeez, when seeing the graphics on vice city 🤩😂 That didn't hinder me from spending a couple of hundred hours. That says something, old Nintendo games still rock, so it's all about gameplay 😊
Sound4Sound could maybe be Down4Sound in the real world?
Getting close to the matrix😂
Can someone please freeze me and unfreeze when GTA 6 comes out😢😢
3:08 DO NOT CRASH A PLANE INTO THAT BUILDING💀💀
Pretty lucky win like most of salad bars wins
W WE NEED WEATHER EVENTS
Runnin down a Dream a vice city soundtrack? Have you ever played GTA VC? This Song was in San Andreas... K-DST...  not professional...
10:11 mannnn this guy 😅
what if this is a reverse gta 3 story line where "claude" loves interest sells them out ... just reversed you know "Me too" 2023
The end of society will come before the release of this game... 😂
It took so long that i've LITERALLY lost all my interest in this game
Sound4sound is Johnathan price down4sound online car audio company
Chop wasn't in gta 5 was he? He was in San Andreas
_Runnin' Down a Dream_ was in San Andreas, not Vice City.
Wow. The detail is amazing. No wonder rockstar wanted to wait so long. They wanted it to be amazing, with this trailer, you know it’s gonna be amazing
Goku Black doing the Carlton dance had me crying 😂🤣
Rockstar did again where the midnight club tho
Will cop a Ps5 just for this
awesome breakdown🔥🔥can’t wait for this, beyond hyped to play Lucia 😭
BRICKell, not briCKELL.
Lol… there isn’t a Miami sign it doesn’t exist, it’s a prop for a movie. Real Miamians knows this.
400 views in 17hrs in a 170k subscribers page
And wait till Online comes…yall mother Fers gonna ruin it
Sim game creatures, takes notes!
3:48 did anyone spot the puppy
Great video, but come on, mistaked a challenger for a charger 😂
Arrest Andrew means Prince Andrew, I'm calling it now!!!
Hope to see florida man 😃
If there’s a GTA online for this, make it so we can make these gorgeous looking women you see in this promo and not some scrawny crackhead.
gta 5 and and red dead 2 was build on the same multiplayer logic, riddled full of hackers that made online unbearable. Is that addressed in gta6 or are they just going to continue to pretend like it's not so and build of the same stuff?
Imagine that chicks reaction to going viral and being in GTA VI
Bring Back Niko Bellic🍀
red bandana = bloodz
so they release it just before next gen consoles so that they can sell another next gen version after release genius.
98 of them are about the dogs
The 100th is all the gyatts
when they in bed together, which character are you 😂
04:30 that’s the Altamonte “eye sore” that’s been slowly being built through “donations” for years
GTA are such legendary games. Each new release is a breakthrough, a showcase of technological progress in gaming. The epitome of open world gaming.
8:36 is a Challenger not a Charger
Game's trailer looks great.  Only bad thing from it was the release date.
Dodo was actually first introduced in gta 3 btw
As a note, Tom Petty was also likely chosen for his cultural connection to Florida, being from Gainesville, FL. There's a memorial mural dedicated to him there.
There was a chrysler 300 5:52
Now we just have to wait 2 years to play it 😔 😂
17:40 I’m guessing this is likely a riff on “let’s go Brandon” or something similar to that. In game president might have their own version except instead of Brandon it’s Andrew?
GtaV-  7 years old GtaVI- 19 years old
That bridge is the old rail road bridge used in movies
*Alligators not crocs
but why 99 why not 100
"Pibwaser" great pronunciation there.
PIB wasser? You missed a joke for 10 years 😂
I'm just admiring Lucia...
Did yall see Denice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not years ago DECADE LOL 😂
18:20 also features Arthur Morgan’s dad - his image is stamped on the glass
No mountains in GTA VI
I'm not even buying it  Nobody else should either  2 consoles later.. ffs  Nty
If GTA 6 really has its own randomly ai-generated version of TikTok, with those events actually happening in real-time, it would be the best game ever
Who want to play Gta 6 subscribe me☺️
One simple trailer and already 99 amazing details you know this will be the king of games!
Hope we can travel using flights to san Andreas and liberty city as well in gta 6. ❤️🔥
Awesome breakdown of the trailer. Running Down a Dream was in San Andreas, not Vice City. It's from the same album as Love is a long Road, released in '89. Vice City took place before that album was made anyways
Incoming Game of the year that's for   sure
How much will a psp CD cost maybe $1700US
now instead of blunt promo nightclub massion we et to fly the dido around im guessing
the flamingos are from miami vice tv show intro
As a Florida man myself, this looks spot on.
Wow,such a fantastic video you uploaded..
Can't wait for the game, instant buy
this isnt  gameplay footage its cutscenes wtf is this even about?
Next step towards Ready Player One happening lol
It would be cool if u can buy pets in online
Just imagine having to build this game, all the ins and outs and you can probably interact with any building, if so that'd be cool. It looks sweet.
Craziest breakdown ever
Are we allowed to submit our own playlist for 6
The bikers and ATV's is not really a gang it's just alot of people come together on MLK Day and ride through the streets of Miami I've seen this alot before being from North Miami and the police do not like it 🤷🏽‍♂
The game details how a 2023 woman really acts 😂
The most epic trailer ever!!!
Stretch a 1 minute trailer to 19 mins that's sum speacial
It's basically Florida already, they might as well include some wild characters similar to the Tiger King. Or maybe they are already doing it....
Nothing has made me more pumped than this breakdown
Pißwasser is pronounced Pisswasser (not Pipwasser), meaning Pisswater and is a german synonym for stale or incredible bad beer.
Is the vercetti estate still gonna be there?
GTA 6 will probably be back to six star wanted level. Gta 5 is the only GTA with 5 star wanted level.
Hopefully Gang Missions/Wars & buying assets is back in play. Hate have $50mil with nothing to spend it on
Looks cool but playing as a chick, naaahhhh
It’s pisswasser not pibwasser
So much details
Not playing this game. GTA San Andreas was responsible for my sudden downturn in high school grades. Watch out for it. It is a serious problem.
9:05 Oh dude, that's the Old Seven Mile Bridge.  Awesome video but you gotta mention Detail # 100 there.
Remember when rightoids actually tried to cancel GTA:SA back in the day? Devs even removed hot coffee scenes because of that! Same with Bully. Rightoids tried to cancel it because Jimmy had an option to date and kiss boys! Now they are seething and trying to cancel GTA6 because it's "too w0ke" lmao
Florida has alligators not crocodiles
Any news on *GTA VII* yet?
This reminds me of when people came together and made MTA (multi theft auto) on PC.
The demaged bridge us the old highway in Miami. Its not under construction they just left it there
0:01 porche 911 spyder
Nice video
that was not a dodge charger, it was a dodge challenger.
Hope you can choose between playing as a man or woman
You get released from prison and get parole, not probation.
The collapsed bridge in that clip is a call back to the Flagler railroad bridge that went all the way to key West now it's still stands there it's just not used and partially collapsed
Gonna need my NASA PC for this one boys
Release now quickly 😂
The game didn't introduced railway features
All astonishingly great my dudes🙌🏽Just make it available for medium powered gaming PCs😕
Im doing the countdown until the game came out 🫡. Sub! 🫡
I’m pretty sure the dudes name is Jason
Im wondering what the file size will be if gta 5 was a 100gb then considering the huge amount of new varied data new textures huge map details crowd assets more ocean biome more characters story and all of it in higher quality. Im thinking it may actually be about 500gb and rockstar may want to sell it only as a bundled ssd pack and make a bunch of money
Based on the exhaust smoke, it looks like 2-cycle dirt bikes are returning.
this game is a heavy slap to all these tech nerds brainwashed with metaverse  this game is the digital universe.
So many years it here boys yeaa
We need it to be released in 2024 can't wait till 2025
Girl power 🥹
It will be a greater see more dansely packed cities!
8:58the bridges represent the 7 mile bridges that lead into key west. One is the old bridge that is inoperable and one is the current bridge that is used.
Trust me the Haitian gangs will return. Thats a big part in modern south Florida culture now.
11:48 the way he explained that is so funny😂
5:23 the cameraman looks like he's riding in a Dinka Jester
Um, not to nitpick but they are alligators not crocodiles.
Did you pronounce pißwasser wrong on purpose or not lol
no doub the game will be great but the "it will be great to see more densely packed cities" crowd should chill some. these are all cutscenes. not a single one is not pre-rendered. you havent seen any gameplay footage yet so let's not get overzealous here
Imagine if Rockstar released 5 mins trailer then this video would be 3h long for the detail.
The future is looking INSANE and I'm so happy to be alive
On the last shot where Jason and Lucia kick the door you can see a sticker of a face that is based of a Farmer npc you can find in Blaine county
Lot less fun when you’ve lived it in rl. Bad luck is right
gta 6 game in brand new dlc character big boss man of saints row 4 in 2025 today now yes 🤩🤩🤩🤩
“Pibwasser” 😂  Pißwasser is pronounced “Pisswasser” lol
This might make me buy ps5 like phantom pain made me buy PS4.hmmmm
This game is worth 100 €/$
Best channel 🥸🫡
the attention to detail is insane
Plz get VCPR back
They better let you trap a croc, then release it in a grocery store 😂
Rockstar learned their lesson not to release on PC. cause of people cheating
Not the guys at IGN not knowing about the bridge
On the plane with the banner we can see that it says why do 69 when we can do 919 and in GTA 5 there were 69 main missions so can we think that there would be 919 missions in GTA six
That pink old school on rims is a indication that we are going to get a wide range of real life vehicles that car was a old school Malibu probably on 26s
8:35 challenger?
I’ve waited almost 10 years for this
Would be cool to stay in a hotel and be able to walk through the building
there are more boats and bigger ones
Any news on GTA 6 pre order date?  Wonder if there will be a online mode.
Mannn we finna be seeing widebodys demons and cats just Riding around
They pulled a Disney on GTA lol?
its a great trailer, but remember what the first GTAV trailers looked like 2 years before the game released, they were very different to what we got with the likes of fidelity, cutscene camera placement, outfits, and even Michael looked ten years older in the original trailers. Ned Luke is in his 60's now and STILL doesn't look that old. lol.
Praying this is 100gb
Props to these guys. Watched like 15 trailer breakdown videos and haven't seen one as in-depth as this one.
Its gym invited???
There is one game other than this one, that 2k works on that will outsell gta 6 as soon as it drops......that game is.....   NFL2K (A NEW GAME) LICENSED.
Amazing video
That was not an air traffic control tower lol.
Fun fact jason is left handed
17:08 that´s not a B in that beers name lol
ALLIGATORS
How the catch reality this is ridiculous.
You forgot that the Dodo first appeared in GTA 3, not Vice City.
BrickELLLLLL 😂😂
Ohhhh this hype? Definitely setting things up for disappointment. Or delay upon delay to meet these crazed hopes
the hair physics is top tear.
This game gonna take 1Tb for sure
pibwasser
The mayor of Vice city is Larry Heavyfoot
Pißwasser == Pisswasser.
looks like rockstar will be milking this game for at least 20 years
the subtle cameltoe on the big black lady, their attention to detail is lit
Yall forgot what an “airport” is?🤔☠️
Pißwasser means in German peewater
8:36 that’s a challenger idk why everybody that plays gta calls them chargers😭
love this. Great breakdown. Can't wait. It's been 10 long years
Packed full of criminals. Are you sure it's not a trailer for football manager 24 😂
99 detail in just 1.5 min trailer?!
Nice vedeo
pure brilliance, can't imagine the amount of work involved in creating this awesome game!
Definitely Lucia in the Louis V.
9:12 That bridge is about 100 years old and was taken out by a Hurricane decades ago.
That's a Parole Officer and you NEVER get out of prison on "Probation". It's PAROLE. :end rant
2025 😂 ,❤🖕🖕🖕🖕
Even IGN is glazing over GTA 6! Maybe the most anticipated game/product ever made
Gona be in prison just like mafia
The Porsche 911 resembles the Porsche real life color “Miami Blue” so that had to be on purpose lol
Panty sniffing is an illness not a crime 😭
Alligator not Crocodiles
Wow am gonna miss franklin😢
yo chat how much will gta 6 be?
Undercover police don't usually wear vests that say "POLICE" across them
9:58 Miami does not have a Miami sign lol. That is a myth from bad boy movies.
you didnt just say pib wasser
Everybody hates florida but rockstar games is like: lemme give yall another game based off this marvelous tropical paradise to prove you wrong! 🤣
will the game exclusive again on ps5? or in all platform
Great breakdown... But pibwasser? 😊
How amazing technology  Gta VI is above our thoughts 💭 believe me
Insane !!!  Details here details there, details everywhere This is gonna be amazing
"The Florida staples of Flamingos and Crocodiles" 💀. While we technically do have flamingos and crocodiles, they are incredibly rare. American Alligators are what you are thinking of my guy.
Bold of you to assume that this will be in the final game
Bro for real said Pibwasser😁 Great video though 👌🏼
Really hoping PC release doesn't follow too far behind console.
why don't they use real brands and charge companies for that?
Uncle Jim's is an homage to Big Daddy Liquors and possibly the old Jimbo's on Virginia Key. In the same scene there's a sign for Pendejo beer or some spelling variant thereof.
This is interesting, no community-made map proposal features all the counties mentioned in the trailer. Depending on how big the counties are going to be, this one is gonna be huge
Dont die fellas  You have to play this masterpiece 🎉
17:08 Pisswasser
Is this gonna be the greatest video game of all time?!?!?! THE GVGOAT??
ign must have a thousand videos theyv been waiting to make about the game
worth the wait
They better put a respectable tribute to Ray Liotta (Tommy Vercetti) in this game.
2:00 VICE CITY FOR LOVER
I’d rather have 1 medium sized dense city than a giant sized empty one
Incredible details. Thanks for the great video.
hope this game doesn’t disappoint me
This game is going to break all monetary records
Leonard County Sheriff looks a lot like Broward County Sheriff.
سی جی هست🕳
The hype cycle is such a great part of a new GTA. It's half the fun!
My heart cleared all cholesterol blocks, and is ready!
Shi got me geeeekin
That’s a dodge challenger not charger
Each time it's released on the PC.... the hacking gets worse.
The run down bridge in the keys is just a replica of the real 7 mile bridge in the keys
I’m just going thru liking every comment cause I’m so excited for this game
Pronounced pisswasser
15:10 song name ?
This game going to be awsome 💯✅
Gta vi is for sissies, playing as a girl what a joke the fall of rockstar just begun.
Too many pronunciation mistakes
A girl as a main character is dope for us gamer girls💗
Vice Dale County = Miami Dade County
the car that stood outside ocean view hotel is also still there you could see it very clearly y'all should've picked up on more little details like that y'all IGN bro damn
Aye we need some type of Bluetooth for cars some we can bump our own Shii driving by mf loud ash
there's more than just kelly county there's dale county aswell seen on the seal of vice city  ih the scene w the tattooed guy
no 🤨that beach has always been called vice beach
9:00 I've heard that that is supposed to be Seven Mile Bridge. An decommissioned railway bridge part of which was blown up when filming True Lies.
Dude u missed the Kosovos flag on the car drifting
Hopefully it has a 1980s themed radio station.
Ok are we certain that we are playing as both characters?! Because we don’t know the guys name and he doesn’t seem to be of super great importance this far yes he’s in the trailer multiple times but I’m starting to think maybe we will only be playing as Lucia.
Der 100 Detail: Rock_Star macht NIE SYNCHROS,obwohl sie STINKREICH sind!! #🖕rockstar
That's crazy that a film that came in 2006 influenced a game that came out in 2002.
So, are we gonna be forced to play as a female? also no mountains, completely flat terrain it seems.
piBwasser? AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
It's PISSwasser, with a S - not a B 😅
You missed the sand on the npc foot while running on sand barefoot
8:34 why does everyone keep calling that the dodge charger. Its the callenger aka the gauntlet hellfire
At least we can swim this time
Please dont say brickell again
9:58, that sign doesn't exist in real life, it was a prop made for the Bad Boys movies and Transporter 2.
Its a challenger not a charger 😅
They really captured a regular Tuesday in Florida
Fake 👎👎👎you liars
Will probably need to delete every game installed to run this absolute creation! ❤
Can’t wait for PS6
People were stuck with boring games forever, just counting the days until the cool new GTA dropped! 🎮😎
Badboys for life
Bit disappointed that there are only 2 main characters to play. Thought they would be customisable.
If IGN give this an 7/10, pray for this channel.
Jokes on Rockstar, Sernandoe already had GTA THIX years before
Petty's song was in gta San Andreas not vice city
ehh when GTA 6 come out and we wait more 20 years for GTA 7  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
99 gotta be a record. Lmfao
pißwasser is *actually* pronounced pisswasser
Alligators not Crocodiles
"michael manns miami vice (2006) was the inspiration for the original vice city (2002)"  interesting
Running Down a Dream was in San Andreas.  Not VC.
My man said charger when it was a challenger
Counting down the seconds till GTA 6
15:04  Dodge Challenger Cop Car spotted
The Dodo was in GTA 3, but it only flew for a few seconds.
Imagine if they released it on PS6
The County for Miami is called Miami -Dade County. Vice-Dale must be that reference.
10:50 Is that a pink Ford Crown Victoria?
You know what was not hidden?  gameplay footage because there was none.  Man, people go crazy for trailers with no gameplay. It's so easy for devs to fool you people 🤦‍♂
The best gaming company ever
30fps 💀
Mud tires???
Why…….. why Florida 😢
The game itself is way better than the trailer,be prepared
18:50 "Runnin' Down a Dream was featured on vice city" That song was featured in San Andreas KDST
what is the point of a trailer when it is not out for so long
That was a dodge challenger not a charger
99 adds loll
Nada de the elder scrolls vi
Donation for PS5 now open... 😂
Vercetti once said "dumb. Florida. Morons." And this version of Florida is called Leonida. Yet OG Loc and Mad Dogg have records and references in GTAO. The 3D/HD lore is very convoluted.  I'm still buying. 😅
Why wpuld the apartment complex only be available on gta 6 online ? One of my major gripes with the gta 5 story mode was not being able to buy property
Did somebody forget the dodo in GTA 3? 😮
Cant wait to mod it 🤣
Actually 2:36 the dodo was in gta 3 🤓
Unlikeable masculine girlboss main character confirmed
Crocodiles lol … different animal, these are alligators
people watching this don’t realize how close all these locations are next to eachother
Put AI in eveey npc
Amazing work IGN, Nothing comes close to this breakdown... anywhere
Will Sheriff GRADY JUDD be in the game to do his wanted announcements?
lol at the way he pronounced brickell
"Pibwasser" will forever haunt me now.
im so exited for the car damage,customisations and window stickers are WILD
What if theres no gun stores like GTAV but a guy who sells guns in GTAIV since lucia has a criminal record and cant be caught up again
I’m curious if the Vercetti estate on Starfish island is still there in some form.
PIBWASSER💀
Me who is still playing GTA 4 : *huh*
The guy with the bandana had to be a gang member... what if he just likes bandanas
20 mins of clout milking from a 1.5 min trailer? Comon now
We needs Jet Packs back !
All the scenes in the trailer look like cutscenes except for the part with several cops kicking in a door, which lasts about 1 seconds
It's gonna an epic event when this game drops
why the hell it aint comming on PC first. most of the player base of GTA is there...
Its pisswasser not pib
Tom Petty's Runnin' Down A Dream wasn't on Vice, it was San Andreas..
18:52 that song was featured in San Andreas on KDST*
The entire Tom Petty entry in this list is wrong and I'm not sure why so little care was put in to it considering the rest of the list is pretty straightforward. -Love is a Long Road was never a 'hit'. It may very well have been popular with fans, but it was never released as a single. -Runnin' Down a Dream was not in Vice City. It was in San Andreas, on the KDST radio station. -Tom Petty is from Florida and is something of a state hero for them, so the choice to use the song and sticker on the door goes way beyond thematics, an 80s reference or any reference to Vice City music.
Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream" wasn't on Vice City's soundtrack, it was on San Andreas', on K-DST.
PiBwasser 😂
What a GREAT video for GTA fans 🏆🏆🏆🔥🔥🔥
Definitely not happy that thier gonna reuse a map rather than a new area, game looks nice but a new coat of paint and some features isnt ideal
The derelict bridge is actually still there. It’s the old bridge and features very similarly in real life.
looks like more of the same to me
rushed video for views, that abandoned bridge in the key west shot was a railroad system built by Henry Flagler (flagler county florida) that spanned the entire state of florida and allowed us to transport goods and caused our state economy to increase. It has since fell in disrepair and they built new bridges all the way to key west. On the way to key west, you can still see the old bridge next to you while driving on the new bridge all the way down to key west except some parts the bridge completely fell into the sea.
“running down a dream” was on the soundtrack for San Andreas, not vice city
Running down a dream was on san andreas not vice city
FYI I'm pretty sure \Runnin' Down A Dream\ was featured on GTA San Andreas soundtrack, not Vice City.
Its Pisswasser not Pib.
Lmao who else getting cyberpunk ads 💀
Kinda hoping you can get different drugs in game and have different experiences based off witch dealer you go too
Thank you Rockstar
Look online needs a Cuba Heist like the cayo perico or a story mission please and can Texas get a shoutout by the way of adding 84’s aka swangers and pop trunk please
Hello Disney, welcome to gaming.
"pibwasser" dude c'mon.....
13:42 looks like Trevor Phillips
You missed a lot actually 😅
Who ever broke down this trailer should join the FBI Crime Scene Investigation team.😂
Runnin’ down a dream was featured in San Andreas, not Vice City. K-DST
Im 35 and been playing GTA since PS2 im buying a PS5 just fir tgis game 😂 can't wait!!
Sweet... only 3 years to wait then...
That mean no more snow in December 🥲
This gonna be one of the biggest hits ever thanks rockstar
I’ve watched the trailer 8 times already
Pibwasser? Nein, Pisswasser!
hope we can buy car dealers ike in vice city
if gta 6 will kill fortnite >>>
2025.. PS6 vibes
Bro Florida man thing COULD NOT be ignored by rockstar
17:08 PiBwasser 😂
There Alligator's not Crocodiles...
This is why it took 10years, so much details,amazing
Great in depth analysis
Play red dead redemption 2 and get the feel of what’s coming
And then online the hoverbikes kill the game
Respect to tue team that did the breakdown of the trailer. Your efforts are appreciated
Each vehicle with its own specific name, if it’s a Ferrari, It should be a  Ferrari, with its own logo. If it’s a Lamborghini, it should be a Lamborghini with its own logo you know👌🏾
Look to the chair when Lucia moved
2025 though.
4:31 is that supposed to be Ricardo Milos on the left?
Sorry, Running Down a Dream was in san andreas.
is this gonna be on ps4 ?
Im interested to know more about what looks like some sort of mega yacht at 7:27 (top right hand corner of the bay) 🤔
Is the freedom factor on the map??
5% of the population but in GTA 6, they are shown like they are 95%
Are those kids playing in the mud in the background??? 13:51
17:10 Pißwasser is actually pronounced „pisswasser“ and means „pisswater“ in german. So it means NO TO PISSWATER
Love how detailed everything is can’t wait to play this masterpiece
GTA 6 going to let us chamber our wheels like on the green car😮
Uncle jacks is a nod to the Flanigans restuarant & liquor stores in miami
thats a dodge challanger not charger yeah you def work at ign....
17:55 take the music from the trailer and imagine the character singing about a girl he knows!
We all look but these guys see!
IGN has been getting better lately
Jesus Christ. Please don’t EVER COVER GTA 6. Please.
The prostitutes are gonna be more nastier
The amount of detail they packed into just the first trailer and into the Vice City world has me so hyped.
This finna be the game of the year  For like 5 years straight WATCH
Florida Keys 7 mile bridge that’s hard 🤞🏼
“RideoutCustoms” also seems like a hint to “Ride Out Culture” , the sideshow in the intersection and the mob of motorcyclists are really commonplace these days!
Im excired to see what they've done with their in game internet and social media.
Im just stoked for the 90s model chevy truck
New 2023 leaked GTA VI official gameplay on my channel!
Replaying GTA vice city and vice city stories. I'm hyped. Not the definitive edition btw
09:08  That bridge is the old Florida Keys Highway.  They disconnected the ends but they can’t tear them down due to landmark status.  They filmed the car chase scene from True Lies on them.
That was a challenger not a charger
That tower is 500 miles away from Miami on the Alabama State line! Dumb and unrealistic to include.
2 days ago 😂
Absolutely love it and going back to Vice City! Well worth the wait
Can't wait
Love the setting so much. Most magical place on earth
Shits getting scary not gonna lie
it would help if you had someone from Miami help with this video. There are so many things you missed that reference real things in Miami.
Even righteous slaughter had a sequel before gta 6
Running Down a dream was NOT in vice city. It was in San Andreas.
All I’m saying is can we finally get a mobile gta VI. So many phones should be able to support a mobile version by now
a yeah the next 3AAA flop
as a south florida native, they really hit the nail on the head with the details. Also the way the guy says Brickell is funny lol
No games would even have the guts to release in 2025 fr 😂😂
Wouldn't be surprised if the base install is 250GB
First dodo was in GTA3. Yeah, it was hidden and you had to go where you're not supposed to, still you could get it in, fly it despite how bad it maneuvered because of the clipped wimgs, but most important of all, its name appeared when you got in it.
Did he just say PiBwasser? 😭
ALIGATORS! lol
2025 is crazy
15:00 Hellcat challenger cop car? (Gauntlet Hellfire)
16:11 Are we assuming the games in the games get sequels more than once every ten years?
Thanks for the video
Crocodiles are alligators bro
Hopefully with the container ships we can finally get (or intercept) deliver of newly released vehicles as Rockstar releases them - that would be cool
And the Tom petty song runnin down a dream was not in vice city it was in San andreas!
So PC release in 2027. Cool.
My biggest hope for the game is that with modern ssds capable of loading the maps faster that we can regularly drive cars 175+
El Chapo will be in GTA VI. Mark my words.
Minorites are well represented in this game, as well as the hood lifestyle as memorialized with the twerking scene.
Bro the trailer brought in about 130 million in views in the matter of 3 days, GTA5’s trailer didn’t even hit that mark 😂
PLAY THE TRAILER BACKWARDS  _ we need to break out of prison at the start of the game
no 4k resolution?
Great video and what an incredible amount of detail and care that went into creating the trailer. There is only one Rockstar. 🔥
The bridge is the old bridge that was used in one of the fast and furious films. Correct me if I’m wrong
Gta 6 is come in 2025
It’s funny to watch people try to decider the highway signs while they’ve obviously never been to Miami. Rockstar did this game perfectly in relation to RL Miami/Florida., when it comes to i95 at least. lol
Is though Lucia's boy friend was named Jason because we already knew Lucia's name for like almost a year now
Bri-kuh not briquelle
Anyone else notice the kids playing in the mud in the hillbilly scene
The Nine One Nine banner could also be a hint at a release date. Sept. 19, 2025. GTA V was released on September 17.
Great job guys!! Two thumbs up!!
17:10 it's pronounced pisswasser and yes it means what you think it means 😂
Lucia and Jason... It was leaked long before the trailer and last years video leaks.
3:08 It’s pronounced like “Brickle” not “Brickelle”
This style of video gets me hyped for GTA 6! I remember watching these types of videos for GTA 5
So does that mean you gotta play as a woman aswell? 😢
The club shown at 6:35 references the real life Club Space in Miami
2025😂😂😂 so goofy
Every GTA feels like a Kubrick or DaVinci work👏🦋
You lot are so sad making these pathetic unnecessary videos
We got a gta6 teaser trailer breakdown before gta6?!
DAM DAM even the cop cars have the exact same color scheme. Broward and Dade have Chargers with forest green instead of black or blue. They did a phenomenal job of recreating dade county truly it’s insane
17:09 That B-like symbol (called an Eszett) is actually a double-S. It's a German word that's pronounced "Piss-vasseh"
No mony, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami
She has a knacker tag on her leg
Maybe like a ingame tiktok
That was great.
JUST TAKE MY MONEY. 2025 feels like forever from now 😩😩
with all that twerking its finna be hard playing the game w one hand!!!@!!!!!!!!!
gta 6 game in brand new dlc cyberpunk 2077 character v in 2025 today now yes yes yes 🤩🤩🤩🤩
The unfinished bridge at 9:36 reminds my of Key Biscayne's old bridge underneath the first one. People fish on it now, since the new one was created.
Running Down A Dream was not in Vice City, it was in San Andreas on the KDST station. Don't mean to be picky😅
Lucia would be our first Female-lead character in GTA since it's inception.
yeah! like all that detail is going to be in the actual playable game...LOL!....LOL!!
17:08 PiBwasser? PiB?? with a B?!?!   It's Pißwasser, i.e. Pisswasser! Pisswater!
2 minutes in am already astonished 😮
These large crowds of people will bring some crazy massacre opportunities
Lucia baaad
Its a Dodge Challenger, not a Charger
how is wezel news a parody to fox news? im confused all it says is news and that makes it similar to fox news? lol this guy is a bit of a dumbass
Bring back Las Venturas😮!
how does a black man with a bandana tease asian gangs in GTA 6?😂😂😂
Great video 🔥
The female protagonist mentioned in the trailer, " The only way we're gonna get through this is by sticking together and working as a team" did rockstar potentially hint at a co-op story? @IGN
te olvidaste que aparece milei salamin
gta 6 game in brand new dlc saints row 4 characters in 2025 today now yes yes yes yes 🤩🤩🤩🤩
They are going to make so much money… all the adults living the child hood nostalgia who have been committed to the games from their childhood with the upcoming through young adults.
The Miami details in this game are insane. As a local and lifelong Floridian I’m blown away by the accuracy.  The building on the far left at 2:17 is definitely the Loew’s Hotel in present day South Beach.  The plane banner discussed at 2:43 is super accurate because E11even Nightclub in Downtown Miami really does promote their club on airplane banners at the beach.  The building at 3:10 is definitely the building at 500 Brickell Avenue Condominium in the Brickell neighborhood which is a high-end luxury condo neighborhood.  The arena off to the left at 5:05 is definitely the Kaseya Center which is the arena where the Miami Heat actively play in Downtown Miami, which can be seen as you head west back onto the mainland from Miami Beach back into Miami proper on your left-hand side as you drive on Interstate 395. Notice the Vice City pink and baby blue colors that the Heat actively use.  The art mural off to the far right at 5:52 is by a famous Miami artist by the name of AHOLSNIFFSGLUE who is a Miami staple whose art can be seen all over the city going back years and especially in Miami’s Wynwood art district neighborhood that is discussed at this point of the video.  You can absolutely tell that Rock Star really studied the neighborhoods that they chose to highlight and recreate in the game. A lot of these things will only be understood by locals or those who have frequented our city several times within the last 10 years.
JOBS!!!! Train Driver, Truck Driver, Taxi and Food delivery.
8:35 that’s a challenger my bro
Wow u guys didnt see the turtle in the trailer
Its pronounced "pissvasser"
the timeline of this GTA 6 could be around 2015-2019 where Instagram the most hit social media during that period
3:12 You pronounce Brickell like a tourist lol it’s pronounced Bric-kall.
Alligators, not crocs, my man.
It's sometimes difficult to see if it's real life footage or part of the trailer. Wow!
They literally have rod wave in this game 🤣🤣🤣
What if you can actually go to jail for your crimes in GTA 6 ?  THAT’D BE CRAZY! 👀🔥
"Pißwasser". Someone please tell the guy you don't pronounce it as pib...
the guy she sitting on on the bed sene the name Jason thats wat google says 💞
That was a Wawa
Nonononono did u just say pibwasser
xD you missed the Pendayho Cerveza on the left door when they are about to rob the store, opposite of the Perry forever reference. But maybe it was left out intentionally like calling Pisswasser for piBwasser and denying its original meaning, idk maybe ign is a christian organization. But none the less PENDAYHO CERVEZA SI AMIGO MUY BIEN!
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that undoubtedly the first mission will be you driving a friend somewhere.
fml it is PISSWASSER not PIBWASSER smh smh smh
Is it just me that wants some of the old radio stations to come back for nostalgia purposes. It would be cool if radio channels work in the same way the real world does, based on where you are on the map you're able to pick up certain radio channels.
Great video
10:01 That's the radar tower, not the air traffic control tower, which can however be seen to the other side of the V. Seems like a miscommunication between your writers and animators.
Vice/Dale county  Miami/Dade county
Such a brilliant breakdown with very specific details.. Thanks
MAN THIS Is SO FLIPPING AWESOME!
Why does the voice of the narrator sound just like that dude from the cannabis News Network on YouTube
I’m glad their using Miami as the host city in GTA 6 instead of using New York City or Los Angeles again
pc vangavum kaasu illa ps5 vangavum kaasu illa Gta6 vangavum kaasu illa   30rupees kuduthu kadaila poi wwe raw vilaiyada poren
Plot twist: 2 or 3 major cities were you commit robbery and eventually get too wanted to stay so you leave to the next
LET THE CRIPS AND BLOODS COME IN THE GAME !!!!
Trailer was disappointing but we just cant admit it. The details on the trailer was brilliant
Rockstar; would you like some nostalgia?   Me; yes!  Rockstar: looooveee. Is a looong long road...
Incredible review. Thanks. Can't wait for the Game
Only thing is we really don't have flamingos like that lol
Hopefully its a really big map 🗺
Running down a dream was on SA, Not VC. And isn’t Lucia’s partner called Jason or is Jason a completely different character?
Uncle Jack's Liquors logo looks like Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation!
Isn't the male protagonist named Jason based of the leaks? That's also how we found out Lucia's name as well
Really wanted Tommy to be back 😂
Im going to call it, a part of the storyline will definitely involve Lucia building social media influence through parodies of instagram and onlyfans.
The nightclub resembles space Miami
Not to be that guy, but we first flew the Dodo plane in gta 3.
So far, these people have captured the essence of South Florida 😅😅😅
imaging playing gta6 online🥲
is Lucia the only protagonist?  or they’re two and are switchable?
Kodak, Rick Ross And X Hood
put my suicide pack on hold for gta 6
caracter of gta 6: lucia_jason_shared
Maybe one day we will get a chance to have stick shift options for cars in GTA
This game definitely gonna crash lol bout to be 🔥
It was a dodge challenger not a charger. U can tell by the taillights
This game will be a masterpiece
its a chally dude ............. prob a v6 too
Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream" is also featured in GTA: San Andreas' Classic Rock radio station K-DST (The Dust)
Wow you are detailed
This is a brilliant breakdown of the GTA 6 trailer, I've seen a few of these now and this one is packed with detail that a lot of people have missed. Outstanding job IGN!
The umbrellas name is “sol sisters” which is reference to the actual company “Boucher brothers”
You had just 1 job 😂 Make it 100🙄
Tbh is there any other game that we love more then GTA , rockstar done did it again cant wait for this one
Btw "Pißwasser" is german and can be translated to "Pisswater" Wanted to mention bc you pronounced it wrong
Question is.. Can we, hopefully, bring our gta v online character over to Vice City?
Miami doesn’t have a Miami sign. And the “unfinished” bridge is the old narrow 7 mile bridge that was replaced with the new wider bridge next to it. Get your facts straight.
Let’s be honest gangster are sexest mostly male
Making a game like this requires recreating a culture from real life very accurately, but also adding just enough exaggeration to make it exciting, interesting, and fun for the player. Striking that balance between accuracy and excitement factor has got to feel impossible, but somehow Rockstar does it perfectly every time. It’s amazing
2:12 no you see killer whales
It just had to be Florida 😂
8:30 missed the Lamborghini Huracan
You can’t play male characters?
at 15:03 look at the undercover cop car next to the flipped over car on weazel news .
Anyone notice the green Chrysler 300  srt ? 😮‍💨
Its amazing just how photorealistic this game already looks
Thought 'Running down a dream' was San Andreas?
Can’t forget that Rolls Royce Cullinan parked next to the motorcycle
Mira gon be tough but thought all the maps like liberty city and Los Santos was gon be in there
Set off my ankle monitor sprinting here to correct your pronounciation of "Brickell". (It's "BRICK-ull")
2025 can’t be here quick enough
Thank you so much for this video 🤍🤍.   I think lucia Story in GTA 6 It's like Fight Club story 😉👌
8:35 left corner  GREEN LAMBO
Why tf you called it a dodge charger when it's clearly a challenger
Who else noticed the "Sunpass or Toll By Plate" on the highway sign?
if this game is made with vr I'm going to the matrix
16:10 that aint any man… thats Rod Wave
It's Jason and Lucia
18:23 stickers on door, hand sticker means "2 in the pink, one in the stink" 😂😂
Her partners name is Sean Strickland
omg they invoked nine eleven in the trailer
Yay single mom simulator!!!! Do we get our foodstamps on the 5th every month in game?
At this rate GTA 7 will be released in 2043
Be dope if they brought back the Chainsaw
5:45 how do you forget the miami heat arena with the pink and teal stripes on the left hand side.
@IGN BRICK -EL 😅😭😂
the tag on her ankle probably keeps you from going to parts of the map.
GTA 6 really makes you feel like your commuting grand theft auto
That sound4sound sticker is a reference to the car audio company down4sound. Hopefully that can hint slightly towards extra customization
dodge challenger not charger
Are those kids in the background wrestling in the mud at 13:51 ???
GTA6 haters real quiet after this dropped 🗣
Thanks rockstar for a Bonnie & Clyde style game and calling it GTA 😊 This what we all wanted also BACK in Miami this is a Full Game DLC
“Criminals, weirdos & parties”😂😂😂
an it will look NOTHING like this when its out but  idc 10 years 10 years for this  im 100% buying it
I’m about to play GTA5 again after 7 years . To prepare myself for GTA6
Зъбелязах бъгове във Трейлъра ужасно много са😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Super happy there is redneck and swamp people representation. Florida needs to be captured properly.
Running Down A Dream was in San Andreas. And it’s pronounced pisswasser
Coming Soon 😂😂😂😂2025🎉🎉🎉🎉
Anyone else notice the Miami Heat arena when Lucia was going wild on the highway ?
You first contact will be your “corrupt “ parole officer and first set of missions. Just taking a guess 😅
bIah bIah bIah....
Vice Dale is a  play  on  Miami Dade County
Npc need to be self learning AI
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazeballs!!!
Tom petty is used because he’s a Florida native as well
I've a feeling that all those "tiktok" videos are videos from an ingame equivalent which would be updating with videos uploaded by npcs.
No super heroes in the trailer
After all the things you noticed, you MISS how the giant police badge featured in the Spanish news channel showed a picture of an alligator eating someone. 😂
another matrix in a matrix
Insane how Rockstar captures their version of reality so well, absolutely brilliant
Tom Petty is also a Florida native 👍
Great video
That dude at 4:01 taking a pic of a girl in a bikini bent over lmao
To take it a step further, the blue and white umbrellas say “Sol Sisters” which is a reference to the real life “Boucher Brothers” which is one of the main umbrella / chair rental companies on south beach
Alligators
Florida doesn’t have crocodiles. Also, undercover cops don’t wear bullet proof vests with “POLICE” printed in huge letters.
With the ankle monitor on her ankle, it's likely she will be the first playable character introduced, and limiting the amount of distance she can go to in the map in the beginning, like the bounty set on the maps in RDR 2
What an amazing detailed breakdown, superb video!
I'm pretty sur u can make a bomb from gta6 on nitendo switch
Gta 6 trending #1 for 3 days got them trending top ten. The biggest thing since Nintendo dropped in the 80s!
You forgot that it also shows the depavity and degeneracy of the black community in the US.
Yeah that Leonard County black CO was a reference to Rick Ross
Cool they got a Peruvian & Haitian flag, but no Cuban flags … in Miami (Vice City) ?
Many people miss the jeff bezos cameo
ALIGATORS NOT CROCADILES
Do you think the Sky Wheel from Miami will be in GTA 6
Fentynal dope dealers keep trying to epstine me with there kids to cover up there dope
Vice-Dale county is definitely GTA6's version of Miami-Dade County.  Kelly County might be Lee County which is where Fort Myers is located.
But...Florida....
just survive 2 more years yall
wonder if we can play as the male too?
Insane how Rockstar captures their version of reality so well, absolutely brilliant
Why 99? Why not 100??
He forgot to mention the Sovereign at 6:06
Isn’t anyone going to talk about the cop scene it’s in first person and looks like we’re going to be able to be a cop in the game
I’ll be dead by the time this comes out , not worth getting hype over something that will take over 500 days
9:55 that sign doesn’t exist in real life btw
By far the best trailer breakdown. But "Running down a dream" was featured in San Andreas, not Vice City.
Insane how Rockstar captures their version of reality so well, absolutely brilliant
A.I is makin gamin lit asf 😃
The car mirrors reflect
Time 8:18 it is a challenger not a charger 2nd video by getting a car name wrong 🙄
no one noticed the smaller wheels on the lowriders
Lucia is a baddie
Jorge Masvidal and Colby Covington better be in this game
Can't wait to escape senior housing to play Gta 7
The white testarossa was a nod to Miami vice
2k about to run out of business in 2025 😂
Yay we get to wait ANOTHER year and a half before they extend the release to 2026.
This gonna b the Claud and Catalina duo we never got to see in gta 3😮
2023.
😎😎😎😎😎😎👌
Some of you have to much free time 😂
How Its Made: GTA VI Trailer
Great breakdown, just a huge bummer knowing that we wont get it for PC until 2026
theres no way my PC can handle this.
Let's go bois, start finding those money glitches 😆😆😆
Boo! Too many people who know nothing reading into everything acting like they have some better insight
The best game to ever be created but unfortunately they re use cars from GTA 5
"We see this detail that's a reference to something else." The detail is some small cobbled together jumble of pixels that you definitely CANNOT read. Some of this feels wild. Not impossible stretches, but not concrete either.
9:50
I'm not happy about being forced to play as a girl.
If you'd be able to somehow manage to implement "Frostbite's" destruction into this game, maaan... - PRICELESS!!!
Must be next Gen only
Hopefully, these cutscenes hold up to actual gameplay graphics.
That was not the liberator monster truck by the way
Pi"b"wasser That's pronounced piss..
17:08 it's pronounced pisswasser
crocodiles?! bro c'mon, they're gators
Bruv. Trailer and im already missing details. Cant imagine how detailed game is gon be
This game really makes you FEEL like a GTA6
you can actually see the icon of the social media app on the news clip, as its next to the channel´s social handle
10:03 that’s a airfield surveillance radar, the tower is on the bottom right of the V
Man these graphics are insane. Some of the shots the people look so real 😮
"It cures emotions". 😂
Maurice Chavez better make a return on the radio
Lets be honest, the nudie mods are gonna be crazy 😂
pi🅱️wasser? 💀
At 0:55 in the trailer,u can see kids playing in the mud. 😮😮
7:15 Also the dreads and grill is very Florida lol
ARREST ANDREW:   A definite reference to 1992 catestophic Hurricane Andrew, which is a storm woven into the history of South Florida.
insanely detailed trailer this game is gonna be crazy
Lmk when 99 game mechanics and 0 handholding scripts and restrictions happen
The thrill billy is a word play on the Red Neck Yacht Club which is a crazy off road/mudding place in florida. Crazy to see that being a local.
It’s pisswasser not pibwasser. Never heard anybody call it pibwasser.
For anyone wondering the male protagonists name is Jason
Twerking actually looks real 😭
Lucia is a the baddest baddie
If only you could go to the airport and travel within the game 😩 that would be dope
YouTubers are milking the heck of this trailer 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Animal Control side missions? Gator grabbing?
They’re not hidden if you found them. 😂
When this game releases its like only 3 to 4 months away from the USA world cup😭😭😭
this crazy
Please don’t ignore single player like they did in gta V
Why do we have to play as a girl
Although it looks brilliantly detailed...I don't like Miami...L.A and New York are soo much more interesting cities. Guess ill have to wait another 20 years for a Gta in NYC again....
Its a dodge challenger not a charger ign you have to do better
Cant wait to see the Colombians, they literally run Miami! 🎉
Bold prediction- GTA VII will take place in Sin City
They're waiting for ps5 pro
The fact that they made a 19 minute video from a 90 second trailer should tell you how huge this game will be. No other game will come close for possibly decades
Hard to tell the trailer apart from reality
The "undercover" police are not very "undercover". You know, with having the word POLICE all over them. LOL
also that stadium on the highway where lucia is out the window is the miami heat stadium
9:27
That bridge "under construction" is an old bridge also used in the movie true lies
Great video
I'm hoping GTA 6 will be released on PS4 as well
That's pisswasser not pibwasser
Credit to tachyon_v for the fan map creation
Released on parole *
0:50 SIX Birds in the Sky
The bridges in the Keys are the Bahia Honda state park bridges in Big Pine Key Fl
Jeesh
Clearly Rockstar is looking to vastly dominate in such a way where other gaming companies won't sell anything this is some global take over stuff their doing rn
Respect is... machine gun!
You guys missed that’s new Chrysler 300
Crazy how yall noticed so much; and it’s also crazy how detailed rockstar went 🤯
2:32 a callback to gta 6 roots?
That’s not car culture. Takeovers are not  part of the culture
Miami native here. It's Brick-UL not Brick-EL lol
cant wait
Bring back midnight club dub edition lol
soo nobody noticed Kodak?
The corner store phone number is the same one as the phone number in gta v in the bathroom stall.
I've never owned GTA or any consol besides a Xbox 360, but when this comes out I'm getting the latest consol and copping the game straight away
My hope is that the swamp scene we see is New Orleans. Or at least their version. It was rumored it would be dramatically larger than V so it would make sense
😮😮😮
in my opinion there is no better game developer than Rockstar. from their story lines, to graphics and details, physics and voices and content, it's insane they can actually make stuff like this.
No snow
The pornography...
Damn you didn’t mention the exact replica of the Kasey center 😂
Anyone else think it looks bad?
Followed up
Now laptop manufacturers waiting for the system requirements for the game, so to boost about their specs lmao
تم المتابعه
8:37 *Challenger
Crazy how far the grand thief  auto series has come, i’v played every single one and they continue to blow our minds
4:38 Looks more like a hotel
The fact this is so huge and detailed outside BUT they said they are putting most emphasis on more interior spaces is mind blowing.
Yall rlly couldn't find that last one huh
Im a miami resident and the sugar daddy stuff is too real. Glad Rockstar is making fun of it.
Shii gunna be 🔥 🔥 🔥 💯
Thrilled to let my wicked evilness out on all sort, shape and size npcs! Beep beep mutha….  Boom ! Weeeeeeeee
The “arrest Andrew” bumper sticker is hopefully a reference to Prince Andrew
These are all cutscene shots 100%
I'm not watching. A breakdown? A breakdown about a video game trailer?we not talking about the actual game. A breakdown of the trailer? Not about a game that may come out in 2025. A breakdown of a video game trailer?
Can't wait 😢
Fun Fact: Miami doesn't have a airport sign like that its a movie prop
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat😂 🍑
Lots of gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaat 😂
Rockstar is amazing
How dare you to call it Pittwater. Its CALLED PISSWASSER!!!!!!
@ 16:42 the Sound4sound logo is actually a Car sound system customizer brand which sells speakers, car amplifiers and subwoofers called Down4sound.
3:09 - You didn't mention about that Plane seen flying between the buildings leaving the smoke trail.
We're going to need a demo to play.🎉
lol why you pronounce brickell like that?
Alligators. Not crocodiles.
PiBwasser is pronounced PiSSwasser.  The B is actually a german letter that means double-S.
Is this just cinimatics? Or gameplay?🤔🤔🤔
“Brikael” LMAO! If you’re a Miami native you had to crack up at this
Incredible details, there so much more is coming
Making a game like this requires recreating a culture from real life very accurately, but also adding just enough exaggeration to make it exciting, interesting, and fun for the player. Striking that balance between accuracy and excitement factor has got to feel impossible, but somehow Rockstar does it perfectly every time. It’s amazing
You missed the iconic flanigan's sticker on the store door.
At this rate I'll be retired by the time GTA7 releases
GTA V trailer also made Los Santos look crowded and alive, but the actual game wasnt.
2025 though is a total p*ss take
3 million gb download😂😂
by far the best video yet covering the trailer
This was a pre rendered video not an in engine cutscene.
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
Idk how crazy it sounds but what if "Jason" will be you, like a customizable character.
It would be madness not have the haitian gangs in a florida based gta again. Thats like taking the cholos out of san andreas
The sugar daddy looks a lot like jeff bezos
The scenes at 14:38, 16:54, 17:30 an 18:10 could be all the same (first?) mission, a robbery on the Uncle Jacks store? Same car, same outfits, same bandans same day time.
Great summary. Unfortunate it was only in 1080P
the beer is called Pisswasser not pibwasser
Tom petty running down a dream was in GTA San Andreas
guys.. trailers aren't what the game will actually look like. never has, never will
PIßWASSER will be pronounced PISSWASSER! Scheiße will be called Scheisse! Learn German! DEUTSCH IST AMTSSPRACHE!
No one wants to play as a female protagonist
Holy details
its not pibwasser, its called pisswasser, which basically means pisswater, so if you drin pißwasser you are drinking piss/urin
Not PIB, but PISSWASSER.
in 0:38 the nickels is moving not attaches to there body in the trailer
im so excited. this game will definitely be worth the wait
Nah that's crazy on how this new GTA game is gonna have alcohol free beers 🍻. That's cool
I’m looking forward to seeing the building in gta 5 to be finished
Imagined getting a wasted screen from getting aye by an alligator in the Everglades.
There isn’t anything quite like a rockstar game, game-defining experiences. So very excited.
Looks like the pink donk has spinners
That’s a Challenger, not a Charger.
PiBwasser? That character is pronounced as an S. I think you may have missed a joke!
17:08 did he just said "pib waser"? 💀
Them night drives gon hittt!!!
Being from Florida this makes this so much more special🙏
🤔
3:40 > Alligators not crocodiles
Crazy how they have milked gta 5 for over 13 years to then tell everyone it's still 2 years away
It's nice and all but everybody showing all this GTA 6 content when it doesn't come out for 2 more years
Nice details captured
Cool now we need a new RED DEAD REDEMPTION
When it comes to detail Rockstars is like the Stanley Kubrick of gaming industry. Pure art. Can't wait to play GTA VI.
Lucia pretty as hell
"Pibwasser"🤦‍♂
Hope they bring back old cheat codes
17:09 Did he just say Pibwasser ???
We bite back. The Gators and hopefully UF in GTA6, baby!!!
All this ant coming out until 2025
I'm so happy that they put takeovers In the game😂 people gonna see npc's smacking npc's while doing donuts 😂
It's not "Pibbwasser", it's "Pisswasser". That "B" is a double-S in German. 17:08
Rockstar!!!!!!!!!!! alright. now start working on GTA 7! We need a San Fierro which encompasses Northern San Andreas, with either an Arab/Afghan refugee character, or a Chinese/Vietnamese mafia character. Thats what we want next! make it happen!!!
100% going to be game of the year / decade when it releases
Alligators not crocodiles
I’ve noticed something you said that was incorrect in the video, the hotel next to Ocean View is not the Colony, it’s the Breakwater . The architectural designs under the window match. The Colony is probably behind the view that they are looking from.
What's the BGM name during 16:10-16:52?
Behind the guy taking a pic on the beach, you can see a NPC toss another a beer.
"Pippwaser" 😂
You said Dodge Charger but that's clearly a Dodge Challenger with the shot of the cars
Vice-Dale county is the IRL Miami-Dade county
in the overhead shot with the plane passing the camera the bridge on the right is based on the real life FEC (Florida East Coast railroad) Florida keys rail bridge, was shut down in the early 20th century but the irl rail line went from the Florida mainland all the way to key west and yes the bridge/s are still standing to this day
Sound4sound might refer to down4sound a car audio company
The guy at the end saying trust sounds like John Bernthal.
did not want what already have in GTA 5...   still waiting on Grand Theft Auto: London 1969....missed chance.. gotta wait another 30 years..
Gotta have GTA 7 in Atlanta.
They better have trick daddy music or that’s gonna be the biggest miss
15:00 isnt weazel news from saints row 3 radio?
Love the clip from my home town, brevard county Florida
This is a trailer and none of this is gameplay… Expect actual gameplay to be at half the quality lol
By The way, at 16:40: the “SOUND4SOUND” Sticker is in reference to the real life Brand “Down4Sound” A Very Popular Audio Retail Store that’s known in the car audio community. It’s Ran by the man THELIFEOFPRICE.
Running down a dream was NOT in vice city. It was in San Andreas. Pro's 😂
17:09 It’s pronounced piSSwasser, not pibwasser 😂
3:39 ah yes, Florida crocodiles
Insane how Rockstar captures their version of reality so well, absolutely brilliant
I’ll be honest. The addition of all the social media elements are pretty lame imo .
0:38 "the traffic in the foreground includes a variety of GTA staples, including trucks, RVs, boats, and motorbikes!" - tell me you have nothing to talk about without telling me you have nothing to talk about
❤❤❤
Crime rate all over the world goes down when this drops. Everybody stayin home.
Yeah but the part with Lucia are cut scenes. Of course they're gonna look great.
"Just Amazing what hydrogen atoms can do if given some billion years"
This is either going to be the greatest video game ever made or the worst there can be no in between
What about cheat codes
Surprisingly this trailer has given so many people a reason to be happy and stay hopeful. This is what the world needs. Love Rockstar and thank you IGN for a meticulous break down of that beautiful trailer.
FYI what you read as Pibwasser at 17:13 is german and means pisswater 😂
Pibwasser? My dude, it's pisswasser... LOL
The messed up bridge in the keys is real too, it’s the old 7 mile bridge that eventually couldn’t be used
return to vice city ohhhh yeh baby
Ok this is the biggest grandpa's named Arthur in GTA6
"Pibwasser" 🤣
Pronouncing the beer's name as 'PIBBwasser' 😂 how incredibly American of you.
Pibwasser hahah its pisswasser
GTA 6 release date could be September 2025. Only 3 Months before The Year 2026 .
bro the trailer was like 90 secs max and tf you captured 99 details lmao
Pisswasser, not pibwasser.
thanks for the work
No doubt this game is going to make at least 5 billion !!
How are any of these "hidden details" when they literally put them in the trailer?
There isn’t anything quite like a rockstar game, game-defining experiences. So very excited.
90% of the footage from the trailer correlates to actual real life footage from Florida lol
Why is everyone ignoring green Lamborghini at 8:28
13:43 "You want me to design what ?!?!?!?"
It's pronounced "pisswasser"
The irony is that this is more San Andreas than gta V
No one   That jobless friend on Monday at 10 am
I’m going to guess that the robbery we see in the trailer with Lucia and Jason is before she goes to jail as she doesn’t have the electronic tag on her leg yet as is shown in the key art. Maybe this is even part of the opening cinematic? It looks to me like all the scenes could be placed together in such a way that they start in the hotel/bedroom and then rob the store only to be chased by the cops and Lucia is then captured in a possible betrayal by Jason being the “bad luck” she talks about. Thoughts?
Think I’m going to need to create a support group for others who can’t handle how long we have to wait for this masterpiece 😂
Go
It looks like far cry
It’d be cool to have a dog like chop, the little things matter
will Tommy Vercetti return in GTA 6?
Fun fact  Vice city intl has the same layout as Miami intl
bro made a 20 min vid on a 1 and a half min trailer
2025 will be the year of world peace. Instead of fighting people will stay home and play this amazing game!
Announce PC
The old lady with hammers would make one thing it’s a clip from real life. It’s so ReaL 🥶
9:47 maybe she was the female in the cover art of the vice city picture
Something to keep us entertained in the trenches of WW3
Bro said Pibwasser at 17:08
THERE ARE CARS IN GTA VI? NO WAY!1!1!1!!11!
april 1 2025
There isn’t anything quite like a rockstar game, game-defining experiences. So very excited.
It has a Bermuda triangle 😂😂😂
are we sure we are not playing in the real world?
Lucia got cake
Runnin Down a Dream by Tom Petty was featured in Gta San Andreas, not Vice City
Grand thick auto 6.
The beach is color coded, and no one is talking about it
Why you talk about the graphics, it's an animated Trailer and no ingame content, makes no sense 😂😂😂
“Pibwasser” 😂
How many characters are playable?
Crazy how much you spotted 😂🔥
man im genuinely so excited 🥹
The attention to detail is stunning and mind blowing. Wow Rockstar you guys did it
The Dodo plane was first used in GTA3 not VC
Nerdiest video I've seen yet and haven't watched it!
hope we can all survive 2024 for 2025
What baffles me is console release initially but they utilize computers to develop their games :/
It's crazy that even as adults this still make us feel like kids again
Hey it's the cinefix movie list guy, love your stuff man with incredible voice
-We can see the influence of the 1980s TV show "Miami Vice"
Please have a backyard fight club side activity 🙏🏽
Hold on, theres bermuda triangle on the map???? Ahhh some easters
It will be great to see more densely packed cities.
Cant wait to land my oppressor on the highest point.
Here we go an gta analyst 😂😂
Can't wait to play GTA VII in 2044
The fact this is so huge and detailed outside BUT they said they are putting most emphasis on more interior spaces is mind blowing.
0:01
2025 though 😂😂😂
“Pibwasser” 💀
The “unfinished” bridge possibly in the game is suppose to be at Bhai Honda Key in real life. It was replaced by another 4 lane bridge and left abandoned.
Maybe Andrew is the president?
its pisswasser not pipwasser :(
Im 30 years old and still excited 😂
IM SOOO EXCITED
The bridge in the keys that is broken is actually legit. Its based off an old railroad that used to go along the keys until they destroyed the entrance to it when building the highway. If you ever go down there, for a decent chunk of the trip the railroad is right next to you. You can see chunks of it that are broken off
That old broken bridge is actually real, it’s the old bridge that led to the keys. Today it’s used for people to fish off of.
Vice Dale county is supposedly Dade County here in Miami
❤
The Tom Petty's song runnin down a dream was in the San Andreas not GTA Vice city. Nontheless amazing work you guys appreciate it.
At 8:29 We can also see maybe an Aventador looking car on the left(in Dark Flourescent Green)......
Wow, this breakdown is spot on and detailed. Kudos to folks from IGN team who researched every single bit!
Love from India 🇮🇳 kerala ♾️✨️❤️‍🔥⚡️🤙🏾
Nobody talking about the type of firearms they are holding …
A reason for me to finally buy a PS5.. Or maybe PS6 by the time this is out.. 😂
I'm going to be spending the rest of my life on this game
This is the first time in a LONG time that I've been impressed with an IGN video... Great detail
Dodo planes were first introduced in GTA 3 they were not very flyable unless you knew how to do the glide trick by waving up and down.
WHERE IS LAZLOW !!!! PLEASE !
Pibwasser?
Make video of 99 details from gta V trailer and none of those were in game.
You didn't mention the different police cars and there real life agencies 😮
this game will put the PS5's graphic power capabilities to the test
Using Florida for inspiration Is genius. Place is filled with weirdos
Pißwasser ≠ Pibwasser Pißwasser = Pisswasser
No one notices the seaturtle
Now we gonna see old rich Tommy vercetti❤️❤️
Some Joline vibes 🦋
why Florida becomes Leonida, weird naming.. 😅
Jason is his name!
The bridge in the keys that is broken is actually legit. Its based off an old railroad that used to go along the keys until they destroyed the entrance to it when building the highway. If you ever go down there, for a decent chunk of the trip the railroad is right next to you. You can see chunks of it that are broken off
cant wait for gta 7
This Florida man APPROVES of Rockstar’s attention to detail. That trailer felt like a homage to my city!
haram!
That broken bridge in the keys is real I've been there
GTA 5 really came out when a lot of us were in 5th grade. Sheesh
Leonida's governor wears 3" lifts.
they better have kodak black on the radio lol
Excellent video. One quibble, though: Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream" was featured on GTA: San Andreas' K-DST, and not in Vice City. (The song came out in '89.)
Can’t wait to play this
Jetsam was back in GTA:SA if i'm not mistaken
a juicy photograph lol
Just want built in RP online
also in the scene lucia going crazy the pink and blue lighted stadium is the miami heat’s stadium kaseya center if you are going to make second of this you can use this 🔥
Maybe the ancle monitor is a creative way to limit the players explorable area in the beginning like Rockstar did in previous GTA games. If so this would be incredible creative 😊
GTA6 哪怕劇情不好或是有刪減 但還有線上能跟朋友玩 只要不要強塞說教劇情或不能殺死討厭的NPC我都可以接受 反正看到穿彩虹旗的一定撞死他然後在他身上燒胎
Cant wait to cruise it like 2 fast 2 furious
8:30 Itali GTO Stinger TT based off the Ferrari Roma
Smart of them to only release on XBOX and PS. They will likely get a cut of every console sold
We won’t need GTA 7 until 2035!
Alligators not crocodiles
8:35 "dodge challenger"
Is it just me, or does Lucia look like Jordan Sparks.
Running Down a Dream by Tom Petty was from GTA:SA not GTA:VC. This trailer looks incredible, a decade has made such a difference to the richness of the world. That said, release it on PC at the same time as consoles FFS. They're literally developing it on PCs and testing it on PCs the whole time. There's no reason other than shady marketing to not release it on PC at launch. You're not going to make me buy a console you're just going to make me annoyed at you for artificially withholding the title on PC
didnt mention it but even the sand sticking to everyones feet on the beach is a nice touch as well
Brick-ell is pronounced Brickle and yes those are Brickell condo buildings
17:08 it’s not Pibwasser, it is pronounced as “Pisswasser” which makes more sense…
A lot of this was from Reddit 😂😂😂
18:50 correction: Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream" was in GTA San Andreas (radio K-DST) not in GTA Vice City
im certain it will release on PC too. It’s a big part of the market now.
Gawd I'm gonna be 30 when this comes out 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Maybe there is a Bermuda triangle conspiracy like gta San Andreas AREA 51
my idea was that gta game should start at prison break. Almost every caracter is either been inside, coming right out of prison or busted out somehow..  So. Whats missing? Hello!
Gunna join IGN Crew in Gta 6
18:53 - it was actually in San Andreas not VC
Incredible breakdown! However, Running Down a Dream was San Andreas, not Vice City.
This is just pure florida
A peruvian flag but not a cuban flag…
The Haitian flag is shown 3 times in the trailer. Haitians will have a huge impact!
as someone from miami, hearing someone say brickelleeee, is the funniest thing ever lmao
So kathleen kennedy got ahold of gta vi. Put a chick in it, and make it lame. Lol
That car meet in the middle of the street is not a car meet its a music video of those two girls on top of a car on that social media site
Here comes 2 years of “breakdown” videos 😂
No we first flew the Dodo plane in GTA 3... It was tricky but possible to fly it.
If you're from Miami or visited, you understand how accurate they captured the city
2:27
Not one of these trailer breakdown videos have mentioned that Lucia's partner is left handed in the promotions. Bet he isn't in the release though; game companies are too chicken to do that because it will "feel weird" to the player.
Wasn't the dodo in GTA 3 as well?
You forgot the children in GTA 6
You know it’s bad when you’ve been modeled as an npc in GTA 6.
anyone else think they released a trailer too soon? We gotta wait two moree years now like wtf
500 “Brickelle”
best easter egg video of the trailer i’ve seen yet.
you missed that there might be tolls. the sign metions it with the florida man and the toll station on the road also
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: GTA players: 1:00
thish just make me happy like genuinely happy
The dude kinda looks like Niko 🤔
But its all cut scenes. No telling how much makes it into the game
wow, the amount of details and references in only 90 seconds is crazy
What’s to say these are not pre generated?
The best trailer break down so far!
Alligators, not crocodiles.
We need forza cars 🚘 n this
Rockstar has been immersed in all things Florida for a long time because they have recreated the state almost perfectly.. Man the team nailed this one.
Interesting
The man watering the garden is something you see in my neighbourhood on the regular😂
Imagine the game being so beautiful that It took me a sec to realize that south beach was real and not part of the game…
15:46 Vice Dale is Miami Dade and Leonard is Broward.  I’m guessing Kelly is Monroe/collier mix but I’m wondering if there is gonna be a Palm Beach County counterpart
Have to correct one thing.  The donuts and shenanigans you see is a takeover true car culture does not claim them.   But looking forward to seeing the modding and customization options online and offline.
My dad is working on gta 6 n the shi he tells me is insane
The bridge that looks incomplete is a recreation of the old 7-mile bridge in the keys.
Great now we get to wait the rest of 2023 then wait the entire year of 2024 then who knows how many months of 2025 before we will ever see this game how exciting (sarcasm alert) lol.
That bridge may be an old bridge, referencing the old 7 mile bridge in the Keys
2 billion dollar budget for this game and they still can’t get real cars in here. Wtf rockstar
Wtf teaser 1:30s and you analysis it    30' min hhahaha
we better be able to meet Tommy vercetti mid story
Seems like the game is going to be so crazy dense. Excited
Thanks waiting for 99 more on the next trailer!
Havnt been excited for a game in so long... we all wanted a new one so happy its bringing vice city back
The broken bridge is a real decommissioned rail road bridge
Hopefully the play homage to Ray Liotta
The customization options the dude with the Wicks was wearing like 4 chains , a rolex style watch , he had gold grills also
GTA VI: Boss female dog
Would this work on my xbox 360?
Is that a SKY TOWER(middle left) in the opening scene?
His name is Jason his name was announced and confirmed last year from the leaks
sir that is not a ferrari f12
anyone else notice the pmp 600 aka Chrysler 300 is back in 16:47, missed this car from gta iv finally a never version 🥲
Plus where you can not only see inside the buildings from the outside but be able to enter them in too
Oh
Additional Details: - Assuming this is Southeast Florida, the sun is not setting but rising. - "Vice-Dale" county is the equivalent of "Miami-Dade" county
“Running down a dream” was in San Andreas not vice city
5:46 actually seems like The Gabriel Miami Downtown ccoming from MacArthur cswy
broooo they even got the bridges in the keys right. they gots that old bridge right next to the old one just like in real life‼️‼️2025 THO?!?😫😭
Kudos IGN for the best breakdown video to date.
Alliators, not crocodiles.
imagine playing this on VR so cool
you know ign ain’t got nothing worth covering when they dropping vids like this
Mark my words: Lucia is an undercover cop.  Like and come back in 2025.
2025
Pretty sure the nightclub is basically a replica of Club Space right across the street from E11EVEN.
Thank you for this video ❤
The 2:18 chihuahua 😂
They should bring back the Blackhawk  helicopter
the biggest rockstar can make with this game release will be delaying the PC release. PC gaming is already at the forefront now, let alone 2025.
my theory is one of the protags is related to tommy vercetti, eiuther son daughter or some type of relative. Im just hoping we get a cameo of tommy in some way they have to considering the magnitutude of the game and location. would also love to see ken rosenberg make an appearance. lots of fun things await!!   Would love to also know about real estate buying and if the end game is buying tommy's mansion.
IGN doesn’t know the name of Lucia’s partner.  IGN respects developers and doesn’t watch leaks 😮🍌
some details were weonf like the mug shot was not based on joker that was a real man
Just release the damn thing! It has been 13 years since GTA B release!
Please bring back manhunt and midnight club
Gta is an American simulator for all the other countries around the globe.
Will there be planes in GTA VI?
Oh boy, I'm gonna be doing a lot of social distancing for a solid month or two when this finally comes out
GTA: Bonnie and Clyde
Cyberpunk commercials back to back 😂
you missed the children in the background on the thrillbillies. shows that there might be kids in gta for the first EVER!
Yo if they make it to where we can get put on ankle monitors dats gonna be hilarious😂
runnin down a dream was a san andreas song not vice city
Tiger King will be in GTA VI, calling it now
Vice City was base on the Miami Vice TV show, the movie wouldn't come out for another 4 years.
Most of us first flew a dodo in GTAIII, half-wings and all...
Yay we get to play a woman as a lead character again cause that's gone great every other time
Alligators
The background music says girl killed her family or something regarding it maybe we get to kill Lucia’s family while she is a kid🔥🔥
This is a crazy breakdown. It emphasizes just how much care was put into the video and game assets in a way that I'd never appreciate watching the video without this breakdown.
Now let's all go watch the og trailer again
Florida doesn't have crocodiles in the everglades...😅
The detail will be utterly surreal, & will garner maximum immersion. Can't wait to play it!
No PC release on launch is crazy
Black Girls Twerking on Cars wow"  Guy Wattering  Grass with  a G Stang
2025 wonder where I'll be by then.
That sheriff vehicle at 12:01 is absolutely a Buffalo akin to that of GTAIV&V's own! One of my personal favorites.
Jesus is King
Would prefer more frequent smaller gtas all day long.
Actually Tom Petty's Running Down a Dream is on GTA San Andreas, not Vice City
im literally drooling at the tough of being able to play this masterpiece of a game
Sound4sound is Down4Sound IRL
Watching IGN’s breakdown of the GTA V trailer feels like it just happened, how has it been a decade? 😢
It’s brick-ul. Not brick-kel lol
Dude you forgot to mention nee Lamborghini car 8:31
I'm 35, single with no kids. Looks like it's gonna stay that way for a few more years
That’s an alligator, chief.
These impressive details show us that rockstar continue being rockstar
Im sorry… 17:08 pi"b"wasser???
Vice-Dale county could be a whole name, parodied of Miami-Dade county.
No sh!t it’s suppose to be like Florida and vice city 🤦‍♂️
At the gas stations, you can see the npcs lined up to pump gas… possible fuel mechanic?
Can we talk about even smaller details? Like the sand on the people’s feet at the beach 4:05
1:29. The graphic details you’re describing of her are not applicable to the gameplay. Cutscenes have always had elevated graphics on the people that aren’t there when in actual gameplay.
Dodo was in gt3.
I'm already repulsed, seems like they captured Florida perfectly.
This game is already sold out and hasn’t even released yet!
4K ? dude
Its a trailer of a game 2 years away. Stop overanalying it.
less than 24 hours with over a million and a half views… this is just from IGN, GTA6 is going to have so much coverage
Running Down a Dream was not in Vice City. It was in GTA: San Andreas.
Ive gotten 3 of the same cyberpunk phantom ads in a row from this video lol
You missed pointing the face of the president of Argentina Javier Milei in the last part of the trailer
Why are PC players discriminated against?
What parts of this preview show the actual gameplay versus flashy looking cut scenes?
the first mission is robbing that store you see jason and lucia, and she gets caught up and goes to jail because of jason.
Hope we get a trip to Modern day San Denis(GTA's New Orleans, La)
There is NO point in playing any GTA game, period. As soon as you put some time into and build your stuff up, a hacker will just take your account. Even the people who work for Rockstar are in on the hacking.
Gta 7 not gonna come out until im 56 frl now 😂
Years ? We waited over a decade .
Columbia confirmed
Just give it GOTY… twice
imagine living in this area and playing this
Nice time to learn how to navigate Miami
4:31
Troy Baker???
It’s gonna be like a way out the prison game in the beginning
10:50 for the car community out there. Actual drifting doable in GTA
That's right IGN, milk that cow dry
The map is going to be absolutely huge. At least 3 confirmed counties, Kelly County, Leonard County, and Vice Dale County. The cities will be huge and insanely detailed.
bumper stickers!
8:35 thats a dodge challenger but alright lol
Please don’t let it run on last gen.
Wondering how much the most expensive edition is gonna be!
You're going to need a quantum computer to play this.
Running down a dream was on San Andreas not Vice city. But im so glad Tom Petty is back in the game in a big way!
Watching IGN after such a long time gives nostalgia
Can’t wait 2025 to long man 2 years away just employ more creators 😅
His name is Jason. How do you not know that?
In the beach scene 3:47  ,we can see sand on people's feet..😮
I’m just praying GTA stays GTA. Which is darkly funny, inappropriate, and very offensive. While being totally unapologetic about it. If they go the new Saint’s Row route and airbrush everything that could possibly offend anyone, most of what made it unique in the first place, it’s gonna be a real bummer.
Now let's address the big elephant in the room..... Can the character swim?
Sound 4 sound = Down 4 sound 🔊
In the map you can see it covers Tampa/St. Pete's, Orlando up top, Cocoa Beach and West Palm Beach, then Miami DT, Miami Beach and Key West. I'm sure Orlando and its theme parks will also be a feature, probably shown on Trailer 2.
There should be an actual social media in the game and you follow your friends
smh not a day and they are spamming 50, 99 details and soon it will be 100 more details from gta6 like why the fk u spoil the fun for your self
it´s Pisswasser like piss, not pibwasser.
It was 5 years from the release of GTA5 - RDR2. Now it’s going to be 7 years from RDR2 - GTA6. Going to be an AMAZING experience!💯
Everyone is bitching bout the consoles coming first, minium specs: GPU RTX 5090 LOOOOOL
ALLIGATORS
The broken bridge is based on the broken bridge that runs parallel with the Seven Mile Bridge that runs in the Keys between Marathon and Big Pine.
GTA 6 will have a lot of in game technology like social media and tv interactions
3:33 aint no crocodile, THATS A F*CKIN' GATOR 🐊
You don't get released on probation, you get released on parole, lol.
17:15 the german B is pronounced like sz. meaning the name is pisswasser
I’ve seen 3 different police car liveries, sooooo multiple counties and city municipalities
Gonna miss offroad on mount chiliad. Trailer shows some alternative tho🤔
the 2nd character name is jason aint it
Damnnn they even got the boys wit the wicks and gold teeth it's definitely Florida 😂😂😂
10:50 Car Meet ups ≠ car takeovers
Meanwhile I'm over here Still Waiting for a New Max Payne...
“Pibwasser” 🤣
I'm going to miss the mountains from V
GTA VI CE CITY
My biggest fear is gta6 is going to go down the same hole of gta5 of being extremely futuristic/unrealistic or way beyond what the gta universe needs to be.
Hats off to IGN for doing the heavy lifting with this level of meticulous research. These trailer breakdowns reveal so much about a game.
Best breakdown of the trailer I've seen. Nice work IGN.
Lucia is beautiful bro
Do better with your resources and be disciplined.
Still no kickstands for bikes 💀
Has anyone at IGN slept since the trailer came out? Just chill, the game isn’t coming out for 2 years.
I’ve watched like 5 or 6 of these trailer breakdowns and this is BY FAR the best one! Thanks to the folks at IGN for putting in the time and effort to provide alot of fun context to the background elements that others missed! ️
Pibwasser
commentary sounds like a school text where you had to reach enough words
People are still missing the point that the game warden specifically being shown is showing the first time another form of police has been introduced in gta history, sure the fbi and other forms have been in cut scenes, but  Game wardens can pull you over for speeding, raid your house without a warrent and lock you up for shooting animals. Game wardens can do more than regular police can do lol. They dont just pull gators out of pools
bro these amount of bots it's hilarious
Bro needs to remember these are all probably cutscene shots. Actual gameplay may not be this high quality
16:15 they made a sequel to a made up game before GTA 6 was even released😭
the broken highway is a reference to 2 things. Before the current bridge connecting south florida to the keys, there was an older one (7 Mile Bridge) that was demolished. In the movie True Lies, a replica was blown up, movie takes place in the Keys.
We about to be dolphin hunting from boats with the boys online 😂😂😂
Running down a dream was in GTA San Andreas.. not Vice City.
What are the PCs minimum specs for gameplay?
another shitty game made by a shitty company trying to cater to a shitty player base...  Rockstar games are crap and the morons that line up to hand over money to a company that literally HATES them are useless incel mouth breathers. If you spend a single cent on this game, you deserve everything your purchase gets you.
Fun fact! Tom petty was born in Gainesville fl. Further tying him to the Florida theme in GTA 6 😊
Wasn't 'running down a dream ' in San Andreas not vice city?
Squeeze in San Denis to the west based on new Orleans
Gotta save 5k for a new gaming comp for gta 6, saving 100 a week from today on hopefully there will be a 50 series card by then
My wish is there’s a separate customized character for free roaming mayhem 👺👺👺
The man protagonist’s name is Jason btw
Its actually hard to tell the difference between the game and some of those real life clips
Now that this is finally released, it feels like the world can now move on to our next phase.
Vice-Dale County is likely the GTA equivalent to our Miami-Dade County  Also GTA Vice City drew inspiration from the movie Scarface & TV show (not the movie) Miami Vice as well as other influences
They should have made the main characters able to be made customizable.
15:39 Doral Florida
This game is probably 300Gb
15:01 FHP challenger
We’re all about to know our way around Miami super well
18:31 Petty is also a Florida native who is loved my all down here
operation dont die before gta vi comes out is officially in full force gentlemen
Personally, I've never been less excited about a Rockstar game.
18:13 store inspired by the legendary Big Daddy’s liquors; side hustle of the South Florida staple that is Flanigans 🍀🥸
Alligators, not crocodiles.
love how DENSE VI is!!!!
The real-life equivalents of areas somehow manage to look worse and less fun than the ones in the trailer. Incredible.
Only 99? Pathetic
the beer brand is read piSSwasser: pisswater in german
Hope there's a mission on a cruise ship, ha!
Haiti is in the Caribbean, not in Central or South America 😅
3:38 Really bro.... crocodiles
Sadly if ur on PC u will play this on 2026 a year after console released . 😢
MY CHEETAH IS BACK
She has a tag? Guess this means only one section of the map will be accessible
I’ve noticed the wing mirrors actually look like they reflect. A small detail but adds to the realism
8:49 this is a wildly accurate example of The Terrace at Club Space 🪩
sees woman in trailer: OMG is that Lucia the woman the protagonist of the game cuz they're both woman?!1!??! sees Rottweiler in trailer: OMG is that the dog Chop because they're both the same breed of dog?!?!!!?!
Florida has gators, not crocs.
I'm just excited for the latina mommy
Nice deep dive with all the references!
100) jiggly butts
That guy on the beach running with his dogs you can see his pecks move.
17:09 Its Pißwasser (Pisswater)
18:52 Running down a dream was a soundtrack in GTA:SA, not in Vice City
Tom petty running down a dream was in gta san Andreas. Get your facts right ign..
Telemundo - Megamundo 😂
Get a life
They definitely were working w kahoots w rockstar.. No way you do all of this in the span of one day.
13:51 are those kids in the background playing in the mud??
Redneck chick might be tracey
9:42 definitely not lucia
When are people gonna wake up to this, they are literally showing you what you've ALREADY SEEN and have got 1.4M views from it. Wake up ffs.
me and 2 of my friends are gonna play this as soon as it comes out
Michael Mann’s Miami Vice was not an inspiration for the original Rockstar game cause the movie was not release when the game was make. The original MIAMI VICE from the 80’s is the inspiration for the game.
TRANSPARENCY ON UAP'S & UFOs 🛸🛸  Now !
Honestly, it looks alot like farcry 6 mixed with the crazy farcry new dawn 😂
it's not piBwasser, but the piSSwasser [pisswater] (German) :)
@3:38 would be Flamingos and Alligators*, not Crocodiles. @ign easy mistake ;)
lol this man pronouncing the names in my city all wrong 😂😂🤣
lol he called Pisswasser Pibwasser.  It's german dummy.
Already?? bro the trailer just came out yesterday there is no way you made this video about 99 details about GTA 6 trailer 😭😭
Waning Sands sounds more like a joke name for a retirement community than a beach. Which would be a reference to South Florida's large population of retirees.
Absolutely awesome deep dive there - best I’ve seen so far! Top notch quality from IGN recently 😎
IGN are a joke
another woman protagonist...... lame
They miss names so many things in this video it’s hard to watch
Like the 10th video of people analysing the gta 6 video I’ve watched so far n I’m not ashamed 🤨
Specifically... 10... 10 years.
9:05 That bridge is the Bahia Honda Rail Bridge
In the mud scene there is kids in the back
10:00 that’s not the Atc tower. That is the dasr. The thing that spins to detect weather and planes
do we have play as the chick?
Thank you StrangeMan for making this video that IGN stole.
Im literally crying wtf I'm so excited I'm buying a ps5 before the launch
Thank you for the meticulous breakdown! 🙌
GTA V is now 10 years old and doesn't look too different considering the timegap. What a masterpiece that was.
The details are insane man. When GTA 6 finally comes out it’s wraps all the other gaming companies
Nobody is talking about this but those "Sol Sister" umbrellas are literally a reference to Boucher Brothers lol. They dominate the beach (especially south beach) and pool service space, they are actually nationwide but very prominent in South Florida.
at 9:11 it's probably the old bridge that leads to the Keys
Everything is women dominated now. Sick of it.
Release it now!
Will we need better consoles for this game
those are alligators not crocodiles…
So your first "fact" was that it could be 2 beaches from vice city and the second one is that you say wich one it is... poor writing
Fyi for all you non-floridians out there, yes Florida really is as crazy as the trailer makes it out to be
Hello from South Florida. Just wanted to note, brickell sounds like pickle. Not brick el.
Lilke and subscribe for a chance too win 500
18:20  fun fact: Uncle Jack's Liquor store is most likely a reference to an actual liquor store called Big Daddy's Wine and Liquor. It's part of a bigger chain called Flanigans, an extremely popular BBQ place in Miami (and south Florida in general). My guess is that it's the one in coconut grove which is about a half hour drive (in real life) from Brickell (The big city with the buildings with holes and in the Lucia highway scene). If this is the case, already seeing buildings from Bal Harbour and including Coconut Grove alongside the keys and everglades, it seems like this map is going to be absolutely massive.  It's so cool, living in Miami most my life, seeing all the locations depicted in a trailer and eventually in such a massive game like GTA 6. Times have changed a lot since VICE and it is definitely reflected in how different the actual city of Miami looks like compared to before. Super stoked for this game
It will be great to see more densely packed cities. GTA 5 definitely does feel empty sometimes especially in places where it will normally be crowded
Sound4Sound could parody Down4Sound
Rockstar captured Miami perfectly during Spring Break
Cop cars are also back to being green in some shots
I’m so excited to go back to Vice City. And I’ll be able to swim this time! 😂
That's Abella Danger. Easy.
can someone explain the clips that they are copying around the 10 minute mark?
If you guys didnt see it looks like we are getting real car and not rebrand the blue porshe and read "porsche" on it and also see the ferrari and Lamborghini logo on the cars too so looks like we are finally getting real car and not just off brands  Cant wait to run arround with my gt3rs lets gooo
3:08 not the best pronunciation of Brickell. It’s Brick-el not Brikel
It’s pronounced Brickul not Brick-L
It would be absolutely amazing if there was a in game social media where you could follow others, which players could post pictures and videos while other players have the option to like and comment on it! That would be incredible!!
So many assumptions
Gives me Max Payne vibes in the best possible way
18:53 Runnin' Down a Dream was featured on radio KDST, GTA San Andreas not vice City
I'm most excited for the easter eggs. 10 years of content and so many opportunities.
17:08 "Pibwasser"
The "unfinished bridge"  is one of the remnants of the Overseas Railroad.
How do you get 99 details out of 90 secs of a trailer😂😂
"Running down a dream" was in san andreas not vice city. Also we know from the leaks his name is Jason, guess IGN is scared to say anything about it since it wasn't from rockstars official lips
ß=ss, Pisswasser
Please don’t ever call Brickell that again
18:50 Correction! Running Down a Dream appeared on the original San Andreas soundtrack. Not Vice City
in 40 years when we start playing this game it will feel more like were playing an interactive movie rather than a game
Can't wait to play this game in 3 years... Rockstar thier notoriously long hype trains.
Damn having to wait till 2026 on pc must be heartbreaking
Sun is confirmed
My feelings say that one of the characters will die at the end
Best gta 6 trailer breakdown iv seen outstanding !!
So one of the news broadcasts mentions a waterspout...will we have some extreme weather? That'd be pretty badass.
2:58
This is crazy to know these details, but honestly it might have been better during 2024 since we have to wait like 2 years still :/
Awesome breakdown! Thanks IGN.
Its pisswasser 😂
99 Details but the release date ain't one
12:31 you sure that ain't Brook from One Piece
Pets being added are rockstars attempt to stop players from being homicidal maniacs on the beach
This feels more like a reboot of a series than a new installment in one, lol
Why isn't nobody talking about the PMP600 from GTA IV :/
FLORIDA DESERVES ITS OWN GAME AND ROCKSTAR DELIVERED. Someone link the Scarface theme song !
bro stated every single bit of the trailer exept the chrysler 300
The girl at 9:43 is Eva Mendes… Right?
Pißwasser is pronounced Pisswasser.
Hopefully we see anacondas
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
Was a great trailer. Just a bit concerned about the jokes sharpness
Tom Petty is a native of Florida, they worship him there.
Hopefully we get this for PC on launch.
5:50 no, that building is a reference to 1100 biscayne blvd the building with a tall hole right in the same place. The glowing building next to the highway is def going to be the vice city version of the frost science & perez art museum.
2025 here we come
Wow, the phrase “back in GTA V” will never be processed  by brain 😂
I’m pretty sure Tom Petty’s Running Down a Dream wasn’t in Vice City but was actually in San Andreas
@12:40 even the duck tape on the door panel. man this game is going to be WILD
This is a reach.. but what if that beware of dog sign is a hint that Franklin is in the game. Possibly in that cop raid mission. Maybe he gets arrested ??
The dude running on the beach with the dog and the chick is the same red bandana guy from internet videos. the Shirtless  guy is Ricardo Milos. How could you have missed that lol...
Console first instead of all platforms why 😢
Could arrest Andrew be a reference to the Zimmerman case?
Hell yeah frame by frame footage of a GTA trailer We’re so back
lol why did he pronounce brickell like brick-L? You can tell he’s never stepped a foot there.
That “derelict bridge” is based on the real life overseas railroad bridge, which runs along the overseas highway. Parts of it are collapsed.
13:12 Candy Paint!!!!
8:40 is that a cop driving an aventador?
Teaser ‘TW’  gta 6 story mode will start in prison, you will go through a movement tutorial there an almost immediately after you leave prison, you go to rob a restaurant/gas station setting the story
My man said pibwasser
By the time the game releases in 2025 with all this extra time of development and polish. This is going to be the best looking game ever made.
It's PissWasser and it's glorious
These mfr are really going to make me invest in an Xbox Series X and 2 ultimate edition copies of the games... 😭😭
8:18 The amount of things wrong about the cars at this part is astounding. A) Those cars are definitely not hypercars B) The Carbonizzare is not based on the Ferrari F12 but on the Ferrari California C) The "equivalent of the Dodge Charger" is actually the equivalent of the Dodge Challenger Doesn't IGN have people who review car games. Ask them to make sure that everything you say is correct before you realize a vid!
Bro forgot the heat arena
11:39 what really catches my eye here is that RAM dually.
Being a Floridian this is insanely accurate
pibwasser-pronounced pisswasser😊
So we dont know her partners name
Lived in Florida my whole life and never seen a wild flamingo
13:52 there are kids in the game, playing in a puddle behind the guy with the beer on the left hand side
1:26 you can literally see the sunlight through her ear!!!
pisswasser*
number 3 on trending, most viewed trailer in histroy, gta is here to break even more records with this one.
8:08 looks more like Chile flag than Haití
at 17:08 it's **not** PIBwasser. It's PISSwasser. Which is a German word for peewater a.k.a. beer or diluted beer, depending on which alcoholic you ask.
But where is sprunk? @sonnyevans
Another year to play gta6 half of us are going to be dead mad
great job ign this is the content that we need
Imagine if GTA 6 online sold a dlc-map of Los Santos for $69.99🤔😆😅🤣😂
as a native Floridian, this is really cool to see and it's pretty accurate portrayal lol
It’s pronounced brick-uhl not brick-el.
This voice is familar sounding??
Plot twist** Curve ball for us- Perhaps the scene showing Lucia in prison is the end of the game! Much like the first concept art for GTAV was all three protagonists looking into the trunk of the car which little did we know was the very last scene of the main game
Why does nobody seem arsed we still have to wait more than a bloody year other than me
This breakdown isn’t SPOT ON, you need a true Floridian to actually give the breakdown.
We can probably expect new consoles too before this releases
Are we not in the 4k universe yet? He keeps referring to it as the HD universe. I'd say GTA4 and 5 are HD universe. We out of that now
Michael Mann's Miami Vice came out in 2006 as a remake of the original series from 1980s which was actually what influenced GTA Vice City along with Scarface.
As soon as he said "is this something we can buy in gta online?" made me wanna punch him in the face, no one cares about online
The amount of detail is crazy
GTA 6 is coming out on 19th September, 2025. Calling it now..
im as excited as the next guy, but it's just a trailer bro.
Masterpiece
How does this look more intricate then gta 5 apart from graphics
Haiti is neither central nor south Amerikkka get that correct bro
I'm hoping that after the main story, the VI will have a business simulation mode where you can buy properties and build your gang....
What's cool is that many of these clips are reference real-life videos and events that did happen. That just shows you how wild Florida is lol
It also gives me Scarface vibes, underrated Rockstar game.
Pray it has the red dead redemption randomly effects
weazel is CNN, not FOX.  just fyi and the "partner"'s name is Jason, both will be playable like gta5
PIBWASSER is actaully PissWasser which translated from german means pisswater ;)
9:56 that is a weather radar but those also indicate airports.
...that's not Lucia in the car on the high way 😂😂
Guys name's supposed to be Jason
just one thing -  'Running down a dream' by Tom Petty was on K-DST in San Andreas, not in Vice City
South Florida babyyyyyy
tbh im not amused at all about this game coming out.
Best video on YouTube breaking this down
“Crocodiles” oh ya forgot we had those in the US 😂
Take your time fellas. Perfection is worth the wait 👏
Gta 6 looks better and more high quality than gta 5.
This thing made me comeback to gaming  in age of 33
So does this game take place like in the 2020’s?
It‘s not PIBWASSER but PIẞWASSER. You pronounce it like piss
We all need GTA 6 right now 😅
They even got the Broward County sheriff dep cars right. Wow.
pißwasser is pronounced "pisswasser" btw
9:55 THERE IS NO REAL LIFE MIAMI AIRPORT SIGN.  It was a total invention of the Bad Boys movie.
Detail 1: Doesn't come out til 2025  Everyone: 😢😩😫
That is one hell of a dissection. Impressive 👏
The different coloured maskes both wear while robbing the gas Station. Whats up with that?
Can´t wait to buy a new PC, quit my Job and play this straight forward for MONTH. Fking lovely
25 years until we travel back to liberty city
Cant wait man we have a year of waiting and anticipation shits gonna fly by!!
Wonder what the soundtrack woll be like
No PC Version, No Buy.
Gator 🐊 caught on cctv camera that means cameras are fully functional in this game
so IGN just compilled others youtubers videos on trailer details and made this.
All looks great and super fantastic. Only the main character and story looks boring. No eextrevagant characters
This game is very legendary and it's not even out yet.
It's not pipwasser it's pisswasser
80% of breakdown videos miss Lamborghini car in the ocean view hotel road 😅
IGN hasnt had these many views since Naomi Kyle left and they hired Gen Z hipsters with pronouns
Pleeeeaaaaassssseeeee be a bigger map than gta 5 🙏🏻
Does anyone know if this is actually in game footage or not...
im so glad in this instance that they let the mods do all the leg work in terms of figuring out exactly what the players want to get out of the game.. now rockstar in all the resources can fine tune and capitalize these notions
After years of doing it , you'd figure IGN and these other video game news outlets would get better at talking about video games
8:34 DODGE CHARGER!?!?!?
where gta 7
The Dodo was originally in GTA 3, in the airport. NOT Vice City. And was a total pain to try to fly.
Great breakdown but you guys missed one of my favorites, Pindayho Cerveza hahaha!
Tom Delongs face is also on the Uncle Jacks door
Yall gone break down trailer for the next year an a few months?
These are parody masters
Pißwasser is pronounced Pisswasser. Just FYI
Playing as a chick really blows
Runnin Down A Dream was in San Andreas not Vice City
Is there even 99 seconds worth of runtime in the trailer?
Fun fact, it’s pronounced (Brick-o) Brickell, not (Brick-L) 😂
This game is going to be a masterpiece 🔥
Pibwasser 😂😂😂 I always tought it was/is piswasser😂😂😂
carbonizzare is not a ferrari f12, that's a ferrari california
It’s Pisswasser
Detail 100, game is the same since 2000🤣
will be a nice game till 2035
These beaches are not ready for my wrath.
Damn lucia thick
people breaking down this trailer like the game releases in a month. the damn game  releases in 2025. damn let it breathe. its not even done yet. how do yo breakdown a trailer with 99 details. it comes out in 2025. a whole year from 2024. chill out.
8:08 left corner Green Lamborghini aventador  beast. In this traffic u cant runaway from cops
Games gonna be amazing
Do we get hurricanes in gta 6?
The trailer is awesome!   Looks beautiful!
They captured Miami perfectly
This game is going to require a monster computer when it releases and probably close to a terabyte of storage to itself.
Man, this game is gonna be like half a TB worth of disk space. My PS5 is sweating bullets right now.
Hopefully they feature a radio station that only plays 80s music - especially songs that appeared in the original Vice City!   Would be a cool throwback!
It's pronounced Pisswasser not Pibwasser 17:07
If this doesn’t come to pc right away I’m gonna be upset
Correction: Tom Perry’s “Runnin’ Down a Dream” was featured in GTA San Andres not Vice City. But Tom Petty is from Gainesville FL so his music is also a direct representation of Florida’s 80’s culture.
the install size finna be wild
They'd better get rid of the horrible phone menus, and having to go to websites to buy cars
steven ogg said something bout Jason so he may be the male main character
One of the shots looked like a Tesla Cybertruck was deep in the background.
Pray return to the Waning Sands.
The detail really is stunning. Has the engine & all tech been confirmed?
Now THAT'S how you dissect the GTA6 trailer!
Pißwasser is german
Pisswasser not Pibwasser
Its a 90 second trailer damn
missed the challenger police car in the chopper view.
Small error: The song running down a dream was in GTA San andreas not Vice City.
Cant wait to see what happens in the Bermuda Triangle
Is it me or does RDR2 look better
Cops usuing challengere wnd chargers oh my
yall calling every female lucia is funny af that girl in the car is not lucia LOL
10 years, can we expect no clitches? No, never
Bro really made a 20 minute video about a 90 second trailer
Runnin down a dream was at San Andreas 🤓🤓
clicking away after he points out that vehicles are in the game. brain dead channel
YESSSSSS
It's not PIBwasser, it's PISSwasser at 17:09
Man online for this is gonna be liiiiiit
Gta 3 had the dodo
CROCODILES….
'Arrest Andrew' 😂😂 👑
Maybe we meet .....Tommy Vercetti 🤩🤩🤩
They're alligators, not crocodiles....how you mess that up lol. South Florida
Fun Fact: Florida is called “Leonida” because in Florida’s history the land was conquered from the Seminole Indians by Ponce De Leon.  You’ve heard it hear first!
4:05 say hello to the angriest dog in existence
Tom Petty - Running Down A Dream was in San Andreas, not Vice City.
Those bridges in the Keys area are real, it’s the old seven mile bridge which fun fact was blown up in the movie True Lies from 1994 and they also have the new bridge as well.
sorry but 5:06 is not Lucia
2:35 this scene is taking place in 25°47'24"N 80°07'48"W in real life
Outstanding analysis. This might actually get me gaming again
the dodo was in gta 3 but it couldn't fly far at all.
As a flordian. We are not compost. We understand the death and we can tell you everyday changes.
The white Ferrari must be a homage to Don Johnson's white testarossa in Miami Vice.
A minute of slience for queen elizabeth who couldn’t play gta 6
POV Florida Tourism sky rockets after this trailer.
2:32 This is NOT a maverick, thats a super volito
kodak black better come out
The Comet at 8:28 is soooo nice
If you ask me, Leonida is pronounced LEO-NEE-DA. Like Florida is pronounced FLO-REE-DA and not FLO-RAI-DA.
Perfect location Florida... If anyone deserves to be steamrolled by a sadistic Lucia driving on a sidewalk it's super conservative Floridians lmao. Bye Karen👋
bro said pibwassa
There better be dismemberment
Why nobody noticing the razor/polaris looking vehicle in the mud pit?
Couple little things, “running down a dream” from Tom Petty was featured in San Andreas not Vice City, and the Dodge behind the Testarossa is a Challenger knock off not a Charger, but pretty detailed vid
Increíble video, de los mejores que he visto estos días. Ansioso por ver el tráiler de Jason (si es que se llamará así el otro protagonista).
I’m gonna miss the 3 homies
2025 though?
So are we playing as a girl?
DID YOU KNOW???: There will be at least 3 different types of guns im GTA VI all of which are confirmed to shoot bullets
Alligators*
16:15 that’s actually rod wave
Cops have hellcat challengers, weasel news shot of freeway
the partners name is Jason, incase anyone was wondering :)
Running Down A Dream by Tom Petty was in San Andreas, not Vice City. Also Tom Petty is a Florida native.
10:48 imagine this happening in game. You roll up on this car meet doing donuts and join in with ur vehicle and eventually cops show up and you have to escape them
Why is it always cali or Florida....  Make one for ny or Philly or some 💩
17:08 pibwasser... really? that is spelled pisswasser, in german it means pisswater... and i'm not even a german to know this...
Lucia's partner name is known and its Jason
a rolls Royce Cullinan 6:29
Wake me up when the gameplay trailer is out
the broken bridge kinda reminds me of bahia honda key
Can’t wait for this game
Time on bodycam
That doesn't say "pibwasser" lol
My prediction for release date Sept 19 2025. Putting this here to see if I'm right in the future 😂
What’s there to break down IGN the trailer speaks for itself
17:08 it's spoken as "Pisswasser" not "Pibwasser"
Its been put back till 2026 since this trailer aired
You can also see kids playing in the background in the monster truck scene..A very first in gta history
guys its 2 years away what are we doing with this video
"Thrilled to finally share a glimpse of the incredible world we've been crafting in GTA VI. Can't wait for players to experience the next level of immersive storytelling and gameplay. Stay tuned for more excitement ahead!"
Unpopular opinion : GTA IV online was the best GTA online and we don’t need anything more than that
Plot twist: Lucia's bf is Claude xD jk
13:50 are those kids in the back?
Where has the yacht at 19:14 come from? Did it go *through* the bridge?
moment of silence for those who actually watched all 99 details
*"Runnin’ Down a Dream" was on the San Andreas soundtrack, not Vice City.
Vice city looks like a boring city to play in tbh
Vice City is hands down my favourite GTA so can’t wait for this. Only thing I’m mindful of is the soundtrack. Part of what made Vice City so special was the soundtrack!
Coconut grove grove is a staple in the drug game
O quê  não  faltar famosa PUNHETAZO 😂😂😂😂  aquela batida dos 5 dedos 😂😂😂😂
They gotta include coconut grove 😭😭
8:37 more like a dodge challenger
Haven’t seen anyone mention the HEIGHT differences!!  Everyone in GTAV was the same height lol
8:36 Why does nobody know the difference between a dodge charger and a dodge challenger? They don’t even look the same.
another selling records from Rockstar
When’s trailer 2 coming?
Notice the difference in the color of the bandana's by the protagonists? Romeo en Juliette vibes?
8:08 Un minuto de silencio por rockstar que se volvio peruano
“Brick-ell Avenue” LOL It’s just Brickel bro. 😂😂😂
Dignity for 99 cents. Classic!
One big question: Will there be an honor system in GTA 6 like in RDR2?  After red dead redemption 2 we definitely saw some compatibilities between GTA and RDR. like the epsilon cult and rdr2's mysterious cult.
the younger male protagonist from the original leak looked way better
12:43 You can see signs for the Sunpass! Which is a toll system in Florida.
Jsyk, the male protagonists name is Jason.
3:58 LMAO.... nice
hahaahaha  pibwasser
The tower with a hole at 2:58 seems like the same tower from GTA VC.
all the cars arnt "hypercars" they are "supercars" it takes a bit more to be a hypercar.
I’m willing to bet there will be gta 6 own social media in the game that you can make a profile and and share posts to different players in multiplayer
IGN is really milking this huh
One thing that hasn't been brought up is how we may get dual wielding
this is so accurate when it comes to Miami paradise, its insane on the level of details this game is gonna spark GTA 5 out the window
did any notice Lucia weight change? HMM
Imagine trying to create a game and having them as competition 💀💀💀
Y’all more excited about story mode or online ?
Did this man just say Pib Wasser with a B lolololol its piss wasser
the broken bridge is a real bridge
Welcome to Florida you sorry Sh*ts!
Knowledge😊
How many protagonists?
Detail 100: No mirrors in cars
Random fact:  Pißwasser acutally means Pisswater in german
30 fps next gen console playing
Imagine the first song you hear in this game is billie jean
Most of the trailer was viral news turned into rockstar humour
Another beautiful art relic tainted by wokeness
Couple little things, “running down a dream” from Tom Petty was featured in San Andreas not Vice City, and the Dodge behind the Testarossa is a Challenger knock off not a Charger, but pretty detailed vid
Imagine max payne 4 manhunt 3 a d midnight club 5
Lucia's Partner's name is Jason.
Im going to have to upgrade my pc...🤣🤣🤣
You know this game is gonna be great if gta 5 was released in 2013 thats 12 years we will have waited for a rockstar masterpiece
After noticing all the details all we can say is that Rockstar has made it worth the wait.
Not 100
The scene with Lucia holding the dollars you spoke on, you can see the same facial moles as the 'bikini hair flip' scene confirming it is indeed her.
The gta 6 install size is around 250gb
GTA - Haiti..how it looks to me, the social media simulator nah this is wack!!! gta 4 with mods any day!!!
This is a crazy breakdown. It emphasizes just how much care was put into the video and game assets in a way that I'd never appreciate watching the video without this breakdown.
It's not Pibwasser >:( 17:07
I’ve already cleared 500GB
feels like gta6 just made 2024 feel a lot longer🙄
Imagine GTA 6 bye new house out sudden mark 3 coming at you in GTA 6
7:24 u might be able to get grills
Pretty accurate portrayal of Florida
Wasn’t running down the dream on San Andreas not vice city?
There has to be some RDR2 easter eggs
The old guy in underwear is something you see everyday FT. Lauderdale
Vice-Dale County is Miami-Dade County
8:39 You missed the Green Lamborghini on the left
Tom Petty was also a Florida native, which is a nice touch.
🔧🔩🛠CHECK IT OUT! Hi on my channel, I'm restoring cars after an accident. Come see how a whole car turns out from junk :) 🔧🔩🛠
14:00 but why is this hillbilly so fine?
you forget the haitian flag in the back ,when they riding Motors
Pisswasser not Pibwasser
18:51 "Runnin' Down a Dream" was in GTA San Andreas.
Correction: running down a dream by Tom Petty was not in gta vice city, it was in san andreas.
We have to wait another freakin year ahhhhh
This is sick💪🏾
Surely they will have a Elon Musk type character.
if this game aint the most perfect thing humanity has produced, we gonna have another cyberpunk
90secs milked into 20min. Nice.
I'm probably gonna have to upgrade my 3070ti to a 5090 to play this at those settings.
Saving for ps5 pro already
So 90% of NPC's are black?
im praying social media will only be a small portion of the game and not something related to story or gameplay
@10:03 It's a radar tower.
Sound for sound is a call to d4s down 4 sound.
If We Cant Swin in GTA6 Like Gta Vice-city ...😀 What Will Happen 😀
Well done on all the details spotted - it's amazing how much details one can pick out from just a trailer. One can only imagine how many more we will find in future trailers and in-game too.  Just a note - the song "Running Down A Dream" was featured in San Andreas, not Vice City
We don’t got flamingo like that but ight the rest is on point
Now waiting for 1000 details 💯 🧐
hope rockstar keep that level of npc density and details of enviroment to final build,now after trailer out,i see where billions of dollars of developent go to
Alligators. Not Crocodiles.
That bridge in the real world is the old train tracks (later converted to a road for cars) to the keys which has been out of commission for a while now and is even being converted in some places to a walking bridge. Some parts are too rusted to restore.
Why is it in GTAonline a majority of the modders/hackers are in the IGN crew? 🤦‍♂️🤣
17:07 It's "pisswasser" :)))
Let's be honest, after the amount of time that's passed and money they've made, this NEEDS to be great
Did anyone notice when they kick the door into rob the shop she’s not wearing her ankle bracelet, maybe that’s how the game starts 18:10
18:54 * San Andreas
It’s going to be a technological marvel as GTA5 was 10 years ago!
Will it run on Steamdeck? 😅
Considering how many AAA games have delivered less than promised; im gonna remain slightly skeptical
FLORIDAAA
Sorry to knit pick, but Florida has Alligator's, not crocodile's. @3:38
Or what ur saying
Just a thought but what if the male lead is an undercover cop could make for a very interesting story
This is going to be cool. Hopefully what they’re saying is actually true and was worth the wait.
Yall digging too deep lol we already know it’s gonna have a whole bunch of new features
There are sea turtles at the very beginning of the ocean shot.
Well, not that this matters a bit and the video was incredible but that’s not the control tower, it’s the radar tower most likely.
wowso many easter eggs gta 6 is gonna be jampaked with things to do its so huge!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice breakdown !
her bandana is red and his is green. the gangs
8:36 dodge what?
32 years of age & I’ve never been so excited for a game in my life
Remind me of dragon quest xii took almost 7 years now but probably 10 times smaller than gta 6
17:08 Bro did he really just call it "piBwasser"
Pib... wasser? Did he just say PIBWASSER? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Leonida Crocs for the sports team
He called the gators crocodiles
so I’m guessing the npc go around doing random stuff and you can capture and try to go viral..
Correction at minute 5:18 the building with the opening is “The Gabriel” condo and it’s across the kaseya center where the Miami heat play . That’s likely the building seen on the left with the neon lights .
Arrest Andrew bumper sticker  is surely a dig a Prince Andrew lol
summary of the video: here we see rockstar's skills in details
Haha. This man thinks florida has crocodiles lol
Hopefully you will be able to buy apartments in most of the buildings
The second helicopter is a SuperVolito from GTA 5
How can this guy breakdown every single thing my goodness.
npc even got AirPods in 😂😂😂
99? that's just sad, lol
18:50 running down a dream was actually featured in san andreas not vice city
Once again PC version will be released a year later. Come on man. Its 2023 already. Why in the name of the brothers Grimm would you separate these releases? All big companies release their games for all platforms at the same time. Its been 20 years that Rockstar is doing this crap. That's some next level of nonsense. Pfffffff
Thanks for the amazing breakdown of GTA 6 🤓👍🔥
6:14 that’s blue car like rolls royce cullinan
bro said pibwasser
Leonard County is Broward County
Pretty sure the Running Down The Dream - Tom Petty song features on San Andreas not Vice City.
''pibwasser''
We can clearly see at 5:04 in the background with blue and pink neon the Kaseya Center home of the Miami Heat.
this is def for blm ngz
18:51 Sorry IGN, no it wasn't. Not in Vice City. It actually featured in San Andreas on the radio station KDST. Great video otherwise!
the beer is called pisswater
This game is gonna he revolutionary something we wont get to experience for a long time
as a huge muscle car guy it hurt to hear him call a challenger a charger :(
I’m gonna have so much fun just walking in the beach
The tv series Miami Vice was the inspiration for GTA vice city, not Michael mann’s version. Because it hadn’t even come out yet…
That's literally more details than there are seconds in the trailer.
Great video. All minor unnoticeable details in debth. 1 trailer = 100+ details because vehicles, graphic's, physic's and mechanic's is still unexplained but showcased in this trailer. But this video showed me even more than my own eyes. thanks man
Rtx6070 is needed for this game💀😮‍💨
Alligators not crocodiles
Why are we being forced to play as a female is bad enough? We have to make these choices while playing c o d
The bridge at 9:15 is the Bahia Honda bridge. It was an old railway for when the keys were connected only by rail. It’s still there today and is now a state park.
😂😂😂😂😂 that blip to stop drug flow.  Fair to say thats not worth a ham shank
We literally got 90 seconds of this and there are already people finding hundreds of details from it 💀
As a Miami resident, it’s almost uncanny how well Rockstar replicated modern day South Florida.
18:53 it was NOT featured in Vice City. It was featured in San Andreas.
Wtf I’m suppose to do for a year
The chinese build buildings with holes in them.  For dragons. A tradition
Just think. VC is alive. Just waiting on us arriving
Thank you for extending the trailer to 20 minutes
To damn accurate
3:38 Alligators. Not crocodiles. We do have crocodiles as well, but, they're much more rare. Sorry to be that guy, but yeah.
Breaking down 1 min into 20min is insane content generation.  ! Rockstar got the internet working over time 😂😂
Life invader is actually gonna be something now.
2025 is long from now
GTA 6 isn’t really as much violence as we thought it was.🤦🏾‍♂️
11:59 guessing by the color scheme of the car I’d say Leonard County is based off of Broward County so we can take a rough estimate of where this would be on the map. I’d say Kelly county is probably Monroe county.
‘Running Down a Dream’ wasn’t on the Vice City soundtrack.   It was on the San Andreas soundtrack.
Running down a dream was in san andreas not vice city
At 6:04 in the beginning of the clip, The artwork is from a real well known artist @aholsnifsglue famous for his eye grafitti. Hopefully more if not all will be inspired by more local talent :)
Female lead character....yea im not playing this
Lucy and her man Look like Kate and Jack from Lost
1:25 All the talk about detailed hair detailed this that... People need to realitze that this is not gameplay and gameplay will never look like this.
The sand on the feet is crazy!!!!!!
Over this week I've just been injecting this trailer into my veins
8:36 that’s a challenger bud lol
Thanks for this!!
Are they going with multiple playable characters like in GTA5?
Can't wait to ride a bike in that broken bridge
Gotta Love the reality improvement but dude, isn’t it too graphic to take your car and run over all that beach people just like in any other gta ? Idk
This was a great video! Just noticed there's a small correction to be made, Tom Petty's Runnin' Down a Dream was featured in GTA San Andreas, not Vice City
Amazing breakdown. Isn't the male character named Jason?
4893 4702 1652 0632 One dollar will save a life
Wish Micheal was in the game too 😔
In the states whats the difference between a police officer and a sheriff?
Running down a dream is in San Andreas not Vice City.
Cuban gang? Haitian gang? You mean bloods and crips? 😂😂
Yall missed the green rolls royce cullinan behind the motorcycle and the green aventador going down the street behind the old Ferrari.
2025 seems so far away
Guess I’m buying a PS5 in 2025
How love how gta breakdown is back and new mystery things will come on gta 6 ❤
looks like we will have an alligator instead of Chop
There has never been a game after gta 5 and red dead 2 that created this much hype that media channels are looking for single details to pass time❤
8:37 dodge Challenger.*
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shame they didn’t make blinding lights the theme song
18:53 running down a dream was in san andreas not in vice city
You realize this is a scripted in engine cutscene right?  Go watch the GTA V release trailer and tell me if you still think the final game will be like this.
Where's the time stamp guy when you need him
The fact this is so huge and detailed outside BUT they said they are putting most emphasis on more interior spaces is mind blowing.
Real fans first flew the Dodo in GTA 3
Didnt they already do Miami?  Like.. it was an entire game that has already existed.
Caribbean culture *
Remember, when speaking about the level of graphical detail, this is a cinematic trailer and not a gameplay trailer.
Pißwasser is not pibwater it's pisswasser
When this is released I´ll lock myself at home and won´t see the sun for at least 2 weeks
The carbonazzire is based on the California not the f12. But whatever.
Very impressive analytical video bro 🔥
Everyone after completing GTA VI: “Well I’m bored now, when’s GTA VII out?”
17:08 Pibwasser  riiiiight
Sigh, Tom Petty's Running Down A Dream was on K-DST on San Andreas, not Vice City.
So has there since been any new info on that "dolls of destruction" website that poped up? Is that real/related to the ingame band shirt?
What if........this trailer is just showing us more of Lucia and her partner and a glimps of VC and Leonida.  The next trailer will showcase Jason and more of VC and Leonida.(or whatever his name will be) That would be cool.
its called Pißwasser (Pisswasser) not Pibwasser 😂
10:19 Dad Bod Squad the "Ay Papi" is a GTA 3 reference.
Number 1: *NPCS ARE PACKED!!*
Great job, but you missed one thing maybe. There are kids in the Thrillbilly Mud Club video.
My inspiration!! ❤😂
Ima need the global powers to delay WW3 for a few more years. We need GTA 6 to get here first
A moment of silence for queen elizabeth,who couldn't play GTA 6
Let's get real. Most of the items shown here won't make to actual game
running down a dream was also in san andreas too 😂ign he forgot to mention that
gta 6: house arrest edition. You just stay home in game and play vice city remastered on lucia's tv
It's "Pisswasser" not "Pibwasser"
8:36 challenger not charger
my bet is that the male protagonist is an undercover agent of some type.
It’s BRICKELL.
"Pipwasser" 💀
The dodo was actually introduced In gta3 😊
This makes me wanna go back to Miami again😭
The detail I'm skeptical about is the social media aspect of it.
technically it's 1 year later in the gta universe because in the leaks they mention what's his face is dead from getting his head blown off life invader dude
damn  6 dec 2023
Now imagine how big the gamefile of the game
The Liquor store being robbed called Uncle Jack's is a parody of Big Daddy's Wine & Liquor Store, it's part of the Flanigan's Franchise. There are alot in Florida. Alot of people still haven't noticed that.
You couldn't make it to 100?
2026 pc guys :(
Bro said Pib wasser pelase
That wasnt a motorcycle gang, people just ride their dirtbikes and quads through the streets down here in massive mobs lol
3:36 Alligators... Not Crocodiles. Florida does have Crocodiles but they are much smaller than alligators, much less common, and look distinctly different.
Looks like deer confirmed in the background of everglades shot. Couldn't see it on my own screen but the zoom in here you can definitely see it. This makes me think hunting will definitely be in the game.
What do you mean it's not clear who the bikini girl is? It's Lucia lol plain as day
"it will arrive the following year" broke my damn heart..
IGN really called a Challenger a Charger lmao
The media coverage feature probably coming back omg
How did you not note that the liquor store is based off of Flanny’s/Big Daddy’s? Massive Miami Culture.
Those are rednecks, not hillbillies
I’d say weasel is more CNN with all the red.
It's only right to have Haitians and little Haiti in GTA 6 🇭🇹
Biggest details: none of this is Gameplay..
Regarding the ankle monitor it could be a way for Lucia to stay inside a certain area of the map for earlier missions so you cant go explore
At 5:45 this is a reference to "The Gabriel Hotel", a hotel located right next to the Arena, with it's signature "hole" in the side, much like the older but also famous "Atlantis on Bickell" Also, that "Airport Sign" was a just prop for Michael Bay's 1995 film "Bad Boys" but its an amazing homage to that film!
pibwater???? pisswasser
NO PC RELEASE ARE THEY INSANE?
Jason
Ur gonna need a monster pc to run this
Gta 6>>>>>>>>>all games
The nightclub its CLUB SPACE!!!
it was only one minute trailer bro 💀
We have to bring back playing basketball in GTA, they had that in GTA San Andreas
A game thats gonna turn the world upside down
ALLIGATORS NOT CROCODILES
On behalf of those from Miami, that is NOT how you pronounce Brickell 😂
Going to need a 5090 to run this on
With all those flamingos, byebye frame rate.
Its pisswasser not pibwasser
We would have this game now if it weren’t for Covid. We would all be grinding right now. Thanks, China!
shiet :o
we will need a 3000 $ dollar pc to run this ...
Wynwood for life my hood changed 😢
Detail number 100 first ever left-handed GTA protagonist.
Hopefully you guys don't lay off thousands of employees right before Christmas this year.
Tom Petty's Running Down A Dream was actually on San Andreas and not Vice City
Only 1080p? It’s nearly 2024 guys. Thumbs down
u guys should just do game review.. stop this nonsense
I’m probably the only person underwhelmed by the trailer.
100% going to be game of the year / decade when it releases
💯💯💯
10:03 this is too funny
Now imagine how the next Liberty City looks
Man, the amount of details you get from one little minute trailer. Lol
cant wait
the game is gonna be huge
So u play as a chick
❤
Can you stop bringing up rdr2 nobody cares about that game we're here for GTA 6
Gonna need a classic station with all the songs from Vice City
These Everglades finna go crazy
Btw it’s brick-cull not bric-kell
18:52 Running down a dream was featured on GTA San Andreas, not Vice City
Liberty city is supposed to return in gta6
We can also see a green and black mettalic  lamborghini gallardo on the left side where you named all the cars in the game
GTA ❤️
Lets hope the game still looks like this when we get it. Don't put it on the old systems please they're holding us back from games looking and being better
8:40 green bugatti on the left
You missed one thing, sideview mirrors actually work
Looks like the Canadian flag not Haiti 😭😭
Tommy Vercetti is going to be the final Boss...  (Calling it) Bring back Maurice Chavez at VCPR  - Plz
Hate to be pedantic but the car at 8:35 is a Challenger not a Charger
17:43  Hot Coffee confirmed!  Speaking of hair technology...
4:40   Correction:  Vice City was not inspired by Michael Mann's Miami Vice. This is impossible because Vice City came out in 2002 and the movie came out 4 years later.  The game was actually based on Miami Vice, the TV Show from the 80's.
GTA had to return for the real IGN to return too, loved the video
5:46  those buildings are actually based/recreated of those towers located at 1100 Biscayne Blvd.
Lmfao those are gators not crocs
Why did rockstar make her so fine
so we gonna play as female now....
Don’t forget this is a _trailer_, end product might not be like it at all
Surprised IGN pulled out all the stops for this one. You don’t ever put this energy into typical vids. Shows this truly is a moment in history
Vice Dale County is a play on Miami-Dade County, which is just the county Vice City itself will be in 👍
BOTW took a long time to come out so im hoping 10 years of development will make this the best game ever
They need to bring back multiplayer like in GTA San Andreas and cheat codes
Prince Andrew confirmed to be part of the GTA universe I’d say.
so detailed yet amazing trailer for average consumer
you missed the Miami Heat Arena
Mad respect to the IGN crew for making this masterpiece of a trailer breakdown.
Someone had a really cool idea, what if with Lucia she’s restricted to certain areas at first while having the monitor
Can’t wait! 😀
GTA 6 is a Florida simulator
Wasn't "Running down the dream" in San Andreas, not Vice City?
Ready for playstation 6
5:46 aint that the Heat arena??? 🤔
Correction: pißwasser is pronounced pisswasser and the joke is that it's called piss and multiple billboards advertise it in questionable ways that are related to pee in previous installments.
Women’s pelvis and groin looks little funky like every woman has stick on their groin
ROCkSTAR GAMES ARE BADASSES WOW🔥
bro u awake
Considering gta 6 is set in Florida I’m almost positive Leonard county is a nod to lynyrd skynyrd but maybe not
It’s Pisswasser*, which makes it funnier 😂
Feel like gta 6 gonna be a huge disappointment
This will definitely be the beat game in gaming history
nice and cool !!  IGN u did always best wow
I'm so excited.... like wow
"Pibwasser" seems this guy didn't do his research to find out it's not pronounced like this
Running Down the Dream was actually in San Andreas, not Vice City.
Those are alligators. And it’s not pronounced brick El. That’s a challenger not a charger.
considering how accurate they've depicted soflo they NEED to include the "Your wife is hot." billboards
The mudding is making fun of like rednecks with paychecks! In Florida, they hit mud holes on sxs & lifted mud trucks not racing
Lucia is fine lol
that’s a challenger ign
Can't wait this game with my rtx 6000 soon
Im about to buy an xbox for this cause im not waiting till  the pc release
I’m going to guess that the robbery we see in the trailer with Lucia and Jason is before she goes to jail as she doesn’t have the electronic tag on her leg yet as is shown in the key art. Maybe this is even part of the opening cinematic? It looks to me like all the scenes could be placed together in such a way that they start in the hotel/bedroom and then rob the store only to be chased by the cops and Lucia is then captured in a possible betrayal by Jason being the “bad luck” she talks about. Thoughts? 🤔
Missed out on the car mirrors
1 year 😢
(Dec 2023)3:48 5:06 9:00 9:30 10:20
Is it just me or does Lucia's partner look a lot like Michael in the trusts scene?
Jiggle physics are on point
got a hunch that somewhere in the story. there's gonna be a betrayal from one of them..
Has to be Lucia in that bikini part they have the same beauty spot
So is anyone going to mention the fact that every character in the trailer is overweight?
The MIAMI marquee sign by the airport doesn't actually exist.  It's just a prop used in movies.
17:10 did He really say pibwasser😢
Petty was also a celebrated Florida Native.  Very fitting artist for the trailer.
This dude thinks every woman in the trailer is Lucia
2024 gonna be a long year
This is the best breakdown I've seen so far. Research actually went into it not just speculation.
WOW! Greate work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!idk how much time take this video but wow!
8:31  California not f12 😂
13:26 You can see the guy wearing Jordan 4s
Lmfao, stop saying Brick-ell
1080p from ign..... cmon
10:03 That is not an ATC tower. The ATC tower is literally in the image, but on the other side of the V. That is a radio tower.
Crazy how ign turned a 91 second video in nearly 20 minutes
Can anyone tell which edition of gta vice City is this 7;20 ?
1:14 one of our protagonists* its two protagonists.
Like my comment for 100 million dollar
Did IGN copycat Strange Man?
Hope Glock pistols return
This looks like the wait will be well worth it
Maybe we will be the ones who find the 20 foot python
Why do we have to wait longer for the PC version though? It's actually not "unsurprisingly", it's highly illogical. Who cares about consoles?
12:27 "wanted for panty sniffing"  😭😭
Pibwasser? Come on
Dodo was in GTA 3 first.
People need to stop moaning about how long it’s going to take for gta 6 to release. Rockstar could easily rush the game out with bugs ans glitches and unfinished. That’s what makes rockstar one of the best developers.
The best part is how no one has noticed that the number implied where it was too.   GTA VI = (VI)ce city.
10:02 Well that's...disappointing...
The world looks so alive and  appropriately crowded
There’d better be a way to get to Mar-a-Lago.
Why the hell couldn't you make it 100!? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! orz
@IGN bro u forgot 1 thing it's um that there are children in gta6 if u go to the mud club section on the trailer in the bottom left there are children  jumping on muddy puddles 🤩
its not "pibwasser" its pronounced "pisswasser" and thats the whole point of its name
THERES NO CROCODILES IN FLORIDA! IT'S ALLIGATORS
Will they bring Opressor MK2 ?
5:17 isn't that building with RGB the mall from the PSP version of vice city
Can they fix the inflation lol
Female protagonist, guessed it
Where's Messi?
Vice Dale might be like Miami Dade
Im glad to see that npcs are different heights
Does this make it the first ever Billion dollar game?
I’m excited
Wait until you find out it releases Dec 31st 2025 😅
no one saw that there is kids in the mud background ? assuming they were kids because they look teens will the game have them walking around ?
Did he just say pibwasser?😂😂 For such a well researched video that's ridiculous
Do you guys think we will get a hunger bar aswell as a health bar like we do in rd2? Would love to see like a burger shot or some kinda food place where we can eat, also love to see a gym and a strength bar where you can gradually build up from skinny to muscle over time by hitting the gym and fighting
Could have made it a nice 100 number if you mentioned the gun Lucia was holding is a Glock
Her "partner." AKA Boyfriend
Here are 7 things you didn't know about GTA 6...
This is the most ridiculous breakdown of a 1:30 trailer ever. I'm here for it.
Its pronounced Pissvasser. Not Pibwasser.
Your attention to details are immaculate. This made me even more excited now! 😂
Another detail is that you can see children at minute 14 in GTA6
Way more likely those are alligators than crocodiles 3:38
Running down a dream was in sanandreas, not vc
Why are they pretending to not know who Jason is 😂
That green Chrysler 300 looks nice even that orange 90s c1500 truck
This is interesting. Nice breaking down the details.
Isn't the bridge around 9:06 the one used in one movie with J L Curtis and Schwarzenegger about him being super secret spy?
Thinking of ways to take Lucia from Jason by 2025 😊
Yooo they made the game look just like the city 😂 they snapped 🔥🔥🔥😁😁😁 I can’t wait to play they even have Browaed county Sheriff police in it can’t wait to put them on chase 🤣
Idk if I’m the only one who feels this way but… I’m not excited for this game.
No wonder this game is taking forever. Insane detail
social media part is a bummer
POV:GTA7 in 2025/2050
It’s pronounced pisswasser
Not gonna mention the waterspout reference at 16:05
Pißwasser Nein is german
It’s very minor but there are also deer in the background of the flamingos 3:42
Kinda hope they took the car flipping feauture out it was useful  but took away from the experience Also collecting bumber stickers would be a cool side activity
Messi in GTA VI
Imagine, you can rent a room in the ocean hotel. And it’s the one tommy stayed in 🤯
Wow looks close to this in actual gameplay(it wont take new forza) then wow come along way to blockey vice city. Which at time was epic visuals!!
14:31  😅😅
Its pronounced Pisswasser!
The opening is actually the rising sun. The Miami skyline faces the ocean on the east.
fl has alligators  not croc's , croc are from down under!!!!!
This game may be the tipping point to buying into a new console. Vice City Stories was my absolute favorite, favorite game on the PSP. And I'm very excited to jump back into that part of the GTA universe.
Rockstar making a Billion in sales first month of the release easy!!!
If this game improve upon RDR2 detailed world even further, then no wonder it takes Rockstars over a decade to release it.
That Miami Beach 🏝️ with all thots was,crazy real 😂
Nice idea stolen from Strangeman channel. Keep harder
It’s not pib-washer it’s piss-wasser
I’ve been waiting for Vice City to get its flowers man that was my first owned GTA and my favorite. The VC Stories was fire to me too people didn’t like it for some reason but me and my cousins LOVED it. It’s gone be hard to get me off the game 😢🤣
It is neat that the 6 is VI and It is VIce City! 😂 I bet Vice City was   Rockstars favourite just like mine. So that they reserved it to be the last HD universe remake to deliver the delicious desert as the last.
Missed KIDS at the Mud hole. When the heavy guy lifts his arms up (holding beer) under his arm holding the beer.
release date ruined all of it😂. Lets go Midnight December 2025 😊
running down a dream was on san andreas kdst radio not vice city !
It would be so sick if you could do a mission during a hurricane
Surprisingly this trailer has given so many people a reason to be happy and stay hopeful. This is what the world needs. Love Rockstar and thank you IGN for a meticulous break down of that beautiful trailer.
That twerk at 5:15 is flawless.
13:56 with the ThrillBilly mud club, you can see children playing to the left of the screen. So does this confirm children will be in the game?
Interesting how you see a cargo ship actually sailing on the ocean, I've never seen that in a GTA, maybe they could be used to smuggle drugs? Or weapon shipments to earn cash
Impressive analysis
So we’re going to play a game that we’re already playing in real life. I’m with it 😂
17:08 It's pisswasser, not pibwasser 😩
8:31 You can Also See Green Lambo On Left Side
From an audio engineer, when TF will you guys ever turn your audio down.   Like someone talking right into a microphone
First thing im doing is flying into the Bermuda triangle!
Crocodiles??? Florida is known for gators not crocs
The picture of the man’s face near the petty forever sign is a nod to Floridas famous restaurant chain called flannigans
Wish they had some stone ocean references
8:32 dodge challenger*
Miami does not have a massive sign that says Miami on it..except in the movie Bad Boys...
looks sick 🔥🔥🔥
"We don't officially know his name" lol
Kudos IGN staff. Absolutely stellar reporting.
Bring back CJ, Big Smoke and all the old characters in SA.
Miami brickell resident here ….this whole video is spot on AF !!!!
The Game it's gonna be amazing, brilliantly captures the US essence at it's core
This is by far the best breakdown of GTA 6....what an incredible trailer.Given the technology of home consoles today Rockstar might be able to fit the entire state of Florida in the game....
So far the protagonists seem by far the worst Rockstar has ever come up with. I'm thoroughly confused. One of their main schticks are awesome main characters and these two seem as dull as dirt. Hopefully that's not the case.
They brought Jokergang into this 😭
Anyone notice that the green car seems to be the pmp 600 (Chrysler 300) as appeared in gta 4. At 16:49. Finally maybe a come back
Love the Chrysler 300 they're bringing back from gta 4
Is this map already confirmed? Where did you get it from?
17:08 its pisswasser
Dodo was introduced and flyable in gta3 not in vice city.
they will delay the game on pc so you can buy a PS5 😢
Those aren’t hill billy’s those are rednecks as an American I’m an expert
Thanks for the Video! But Running down a dream from Tom Petty was featured in the San Andreas Soundtrack not Vice City.
At 17:08, well, actually 🤓, it's pronounced "pisswasser," which in German means exactly what you might think (Pisswater).
You make videos like this when you have people looking for things that are not there, and those that are stretching things for hype.
IGN be like "This is a woman shown in this shot. .. this woman is probably Lucia"
nice
GTA games have never been my scene but this tells me how EPIC RDR3 will be whenever it comes out in the next 10 yrs.
9:38 oh right definitely noticed the hair😂
Is pentagon in GTA 6?
They better have “Dj Chipman BEAM AHH” on the radio 😂
Ok Rockstar time to start making sports games😂😂 nah fr😊
It's not a PIbwasser, it is a Pisswasser @17:10
Imagine they put a legendary giant python in their Everglades lol
Some of the trailer footage is literally indistinguishable from reality imo
AYOOO It's the guy from CineFix <3
Actually that is not a control tower. It’s the radar tower at the airport.
gta6 coming 2025
Really hoping there’s a vigilante side mission helping out a certain serial killer
I’ve watched like 5 or 6 of these trailer breakdowns and this is BY FAR the best one! Thanks to the folks at IGN for putting in the time and effort to provide alot of fun context to the background elements that others missed! 🎮❤️
think Michael, Franklin and trevor gonna do in gta 6 and niko belic a think because the man main character like niko belic
r34 artists...... yall know what to do
We Have Gators at Everglades not Crocs..
Gta 6 should have stats like gta sa
Why are you watching why are you watching did you effort this 😂😂😂😂
Is this a remake or continuation of the last ?
Bro said “pibwasser”
Wow this is the best detail video!!!!
Hopefully everything thats available online is available for story mode for those who dont enjoy playing online
Just a little correction, running down a dream was festured in gta san Andreas, not in vice city
theres segitiga bermuda, intresting
Hope this is not another cyberpunk
GTA is boring af
How did you missed " Ocean View Hotel" , THE Ocean View Hotel.
lucia is hot af ngl. Cant wait for the Chads on the internet to give us proper material from her. Well probably takes time due to delayed PC release sadly.
It officially hit 104 million and passed gta5 in a day, gta 5 also just hit 101m
Seriously don't care about this will take it seriously one released
Need a Scarface reference like original's Vice City chainsaw in the bathroom or the Vercetti Estate which pretty much resembled Scarface's mansion.
Two guys shaking hands😅
No one is mentioning the kids on the left side of the thrillbilly shot
Pißwasser actually means pisswater lol
taking a entire week off from work on launch day.
Why do pc get absolutely shafted
Love is a long road
Running Down A Dream was in San Andreas not Vice City.
time for me to buy new laptop
These german referances are just so funny from "Nein Pißwasser" obviously meaning "No" for non alcoholic to the pharma sign saying "Angstipan" which suggests a medicin giving you anxiety's ("Angst") - just gotta love Rockstar for all the little details :))
is nobody saying jason is driving the car 5:10
18:50 Runnin' Down The Dream was featured on K-DST in San Andreas.
A part of me tells me Niko will be in this game or hinted towards him one way or another, didn’t Lester say he also went to vice city or either died?? One of the two?
Trust me that shark is running away from the dolphins, dolphins are psychopaths, alligators there are no crocodiles in florida
My life is over when this comes out
There are so little gameplay shots in the trailer (if any). It’s funny how no one brings that up. It looks cool definitely. But we won’t know how big of an upgrade this really is until we get way more 3rd person gameplay shots which we basically got none. Normally gamers would care about this but everyone has been so pumped they forgot to actually care about the most important thing.
where is the map at 3:22 and 5:28 from?
17:08 it's not pib, but pis
Bbl in gta 6
We first flew the dodo in GTA 3
🐅
Thank you for your time breaking detail of the trailer IGN ❤
The white cheetah is a clear reference to the movie "Miami Vice" white Testarossa
Anyone considered how much Lucia looks like Mary Linton?
I’ve never been more hyped by a game. BUT, Rockstar releasing the game in almost another year and a half-2 years is GREEDY. All so they can re release red dead 2 and gta 4 remastered. They’ve waited 10 years bc they milked gta 5 online.
Game of the decade
Alligators, NOT crocodiles 😅
Her partner's name is Jason
Thats not based on Ferrari F12
Wish list  Female online characters can get a BBL Date npcs  Multiple cities  midnight club level car customization  Tons of open buildings like restaurants and fast food places
It's actually Pißwasser, which in German is Pisswasser, or Pisswater.
Pißwasser is pronounced “piss-vawsser” meaning pisswater. (Not pibwasser)
This is going to be insane, again! Rockstar, shut up and take my money!
At 14:12, the video was posted by LuchaLibreFan, and the next shot is a guy slamming onto a table. Maybe we will see american wrestling in GTA VI?
Ah you guys missed the air traffic control tower. The thing you pointed out is actually a radar tower. The ATC tower is just off to the right of that on the right side of the V in the sign.
Saints Row needs to take notes.
why don’t they put real brand cars
The bridge is reference to the old 7 mile bridge that is in the keys. The attention to detail is amazing.
brilliant
how yall got 99 details and gameranx only got 20
GTA 6 is finally here
The guy entering the store with Lucia at the end of the video does not seen like the guy whom is laying in bed with her.
download link plz
Florida is such a wild place, Rockstar has the perfect templet to go all out
Its almost 2024 so its about a year for gta 6
isn’t it Sound4Round (Sound Around) at 16:30 ?
Can we fast forward through 2024?
It's just Florida man with a pitboy
No pc 😢
Got many wrong references on this video though
8:36 dodge charger? Its challenger.
18:53 WRONG! Running Down A Dream was featured in SAN ANDREAS. On K-DST radio.
U forgot the kids playing in mud party😢😢😢😢
They talking like she's the main character, is it not a two character game ?
With the world and mankind being completely upside down, this doesn't feel like a parody anymore, more like a digital interpretation of reality.
🙏🙏🙏
It's piss not pib
Cats?  Pets?
Lucia’s partner’s name is Jason
Rockstar never seizes to amaze me with their level of details.
I've seen better GTA 5 modes ngl
My question is this trailer actual gameplay or in engine footage or is it pre-rendered cinematics
GTA really knows how to stereotype.
Can see this bombing hard yeah sales will be massive nostalgia and excitement big but will pass and reality will hit and be a load of empty promises and online cash cow for R/S waited long enough so another 2 years isnt much to prove my point.
15:08 police challenger, phuck me, also with different livery maybe because of the counties
Jaldi se comment krdeta hu subscribeer milenge 😂😅
That might be the Porsche design tower
Guys remember the trailers always show stuff that is prolly not in the game so get hyped but not cyberpunk hype 😂
Honestly don't care for the story mode lol show us GTA online already
The Dodo plane's first time appearance is not in Vice City but in GTA 3, wasn't it? There is an only one single plane that you can fly in GTA 3, in the airport of the second island.
Mix of all gta
Correction: We first flew the Dodo in GTA 3 as part of the Import Export Garage mission in Portland
Weazel news is a reference to tabloid type news channels like TMZ not Fox lol 😂
Hate to be that guy but its not a dodge charger but a challenger 🫡
finally Chryslers
6:05 a lot of Floridian street culture is big on the big rims. Tends to be old muscle cars but it can be a beat up Toyota.
"Pibwasser"? Really?
it is pronounced Pisswasser, not pibwasser, seeing that they are hinting towards the german language. Pisswasser would mean Pisswater...
Uncle Jacks is Nick Offerman
15:51 looks like Franklin's house
I’d like to explore their research methods - fascinating!
2025?!?!
Jus play da game 😮
rockstar should create its own metaverse
That's not a "b" in Pisswasser. LOL
Hopefully we get multiple trailers leading up to 2025
Can't wait to become a Leonida man
Nice Video 👍17:28 the back of the car looks like the sabre, introduced in gta 3 or the sabre turbo of vice city
Very interesting!
Damn
Can we see Lionel Messi as he is a player of Inter Miami?
Damn fair play IGN best post trailer video on YouTube
OVERHYPED! Rockstar is only about a quick dollar now.
12:26 you missed the incredible detail of the car door, which has duct tape. This shows how far the interior of cars will go from maybe custom interiors to beater cars hanging on by a thread. There is also paper/receipts inside the cubby hole. The detail is absolutely astonishing.
Anyone else see the resemblance between Jason and colt from ghost recon breakpoint?
PS5 and Series X only? No crossgen?
It’s an alligator, guy.
0:06 GYATTT
Goodbye PS4 😭
If this time NPC just doesn't spawn and they have their own character route that would be awesome. But the thing is are the hardware in that year ready for this?
If we can't give our character gold teeth than rockstar has failed lol
Pißwasser actually reads as Pisswater in german :)
It will take a total of 12 years ounce gta 6 is finally released in 2025
Mf's complaining like 2024 is in 365 days not like in 26
at 8:35 the ferrari is not based on an F12, but instead in a California/Portofino
The fact that all these details and humour are already in the game at this stage gives me such high hopes!!
When do we get to see gameplay footage ?
Rdr2 is not even an opponent to gta 6 teaser back then
His names Jason
15:43 “Vice Dale County” is based on Miami Dade County
Another Scottish invention being drooled over by the masses.
Do people really pronounce it PiBwasser? Hilarious🤣
At 2:38, wasn't the Dodo from GTA 3?
2 years to wait till this overhyped game comes out
Those are alligators bro
5:04 that is so not lucile.  lol
I'd also like to mention the undercover cop car at 15:00 !!!!
Already hyped for the game
What happened to the twerking police
Nice to see Bills Mafia made it into the game 14:22
MIAMI SICK
IGN comes through with the best breakdown video ever. 🦾❤️
When the supposed lucia tries to go viral, the guy who takes the video is in a dodge charger EV
OBSESSED
Will the the game fit my PS5 lol?
It's not Pibwasser, but pisswasser
great video thanks man!
Did you really pronounce it piBwasser?!
20 minute video for a <2 minute trailer?  Sigh.
why 99
Boat traffic… whhhhatttt
Your parents didn’t let you play GTA til you worked for IGN
Why does everyone keep saying crocodiles, it’s Florida, they’re alligators
I’m waiting for you to notice the 100th detail:  Lucia is a reference to Angel from the Miami episode A Bullet For Crockett.
Strange man did it better
The glades the keys and Miami letttttsGOOOOO
It's not pibwasser, but pisswasser. That letter is German
2025 noooooooooo lol
fun fact: Kodak Black cameo is also coming
Hope they optimize the game well so we can play in rtx 3050 16gb ram 😔❤️
9:52 fun fact: ‘sessanta nove’ means ‘sixty nine’ in Italian 🇮🇹😏
The trailer isn't really doing much for me
This shows the 10 year gap
Might be going crazy, but the main guy sounds like/looks a little like Nolan North to me.
My kids are gonna be like "what was it like in 20s Dad?"  Im literally gonna give them this game.
GTA 6? Sounds like a cool mod for GTA 5
Cant ***in wait
you missed the types of police cars used in the trailer, there were multiple police cars in the trailer
The hair technology blows my mind.
No ads were viewed during the watching of this video
I’m surprised nobody’s mentioned the online features 😅
😊
Copying the Game Ranx "20 things we found about the GTA 6 trailer".😂
Best breakdown video I've seen so far. Well done guys.
GTA is the one game that people desperately want but will patiently wait for. Even if it takes 15 years to release.
We getting a saints row 2 style opening
I'm calling it now. Lucia is a decendant of John and Abigail
This is an incredible breakdown of details!
IT'S NOT A DODO, IT'S A SKIMMER
Running down a dream by Tom Petty was in San Andreas not vice city
Do we really not know Jason’s name is Jason?
Still two years out 👎
This game looks better than real life
prob no big mechanic changes, or co-op story. Delayed 2026. YW
Can’t wait ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
You missed the turtles from the beach! 😢
The grotti carbinazare looks more like a ferrari california to me
Running Down A Dream was on the San Andreas soundtrack. Not Vice City.
They needed to make up for vice city, this game better be an apology for the shitty first one
2025 😴😴😴😴😴
Why everyone thinks the main protagonists is Lucia?. Is Michael main protagonists of GtaV?
This better be for next Gen only.
Running down a dream was actually on San Andreas, not Vice City!
17:10 pisswasser*
The Dodo plane was first flown in GTA3
Its impertinent not impantynent 😂😂
this is the best break down I've seen! Bravo IGN Bravo!
See you 2026 pc users
Has anyone call the phone number thats on the pawn shop sign?
this game would probably need atleast 300gb storage
Random side note, Brickell, isn't Brick-l, it's pronounced Brick-O
Pibwasser? Come on, the whole joke is that its called Pisswasser. Jeez
Tic tok  format was weird.
Where’s grove street tho ?😢
That's a sabre
lol'd at "pibwasser". it is pronounced as pisswasser.
Please don’t be bad, please don’t be bad…
99…really😑
Next video: 172717 details in gta trialer
we will most likely get more details and leaks in the next 2 years
why is nobody mentioning that’s there is gonna be ambient lighting features in car customization
a lot of people will now question their existence till gta 6 comes out, dying before gta 6 drops is everybody's worse nightmare😭
16:55 If you look closely at these two characters, the color of the clothes looks like Lucia's dress is black and purple, which reference to the Ballas group, and the color of Jason's dress to Grove Street Family.
The second trailer has just dropped and it is even more FIRE 🔥🔥
Rockstar knows how to make gamers happy and brings the best of the best.
So many great details here! Great job!! Being a born and raised Floridian this so so cool to see
Did he just say Pibwasser? Hahah. It's pronounced Pisswasser which should give a hint as to what it means.
Really nice list of details, but here are some mistakes that caught my eyes: 1.) Vice City was heavily based on the original Miami Vice series, not on the movie (which was released way after Vice City) 2.) It's not "Pibwasser" but "Pisswasser" 3.) Not every single female NPC you see is Lucia 😂
This is the same channel when MK1 came out they said they guy in the trailer (that turned out to be raiden) said that he was actually the great kung loa 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 so whatever they say in this video take 70% and throw it away............
looks more like GTA5 singleplayer DLC than a new game imo :)
If they fit in Tommy Vercetti somewhere in the story, it would be awesome!!
Don’t understand why everyone hyped.  It’s been 10 years and that makes you happy ?  Gtfoh weak for 10+ years that will run at 30 fps on next gen.really breaking barriers here.
Wish there was no girl as main character
Yup ! NOT Jason y'all !!!!
Just 24 hours and it's everywhere 🔥
All of the detail proding and the clip for 1984 Miami Vice is from the reboot movie.😅
Time to save for a New PC. This crowd with these jiggle physics and modern graphics Will not run on a 2060
IGN put more effort into breaking down a 1:31 video instead of making a decent review video for baldurs gate 3 and starfield
1 - 99 = No PC launch.
Dadbodsquad has an instagram page
U didn’t talk about the Vice City marathon on Weasel news
They’re alligators not crocodiles you rxtard
Best breakdown of the new trailer I’ve seen so far - great job 👍🏻 🇮🇪
no thin girls only pawgs and pabgs
Theatrical trailer don't forget. Calm down gullible people. Just wait until in game playable footage is shown before cracking open your champagne.
IGN still getting stuff wrong we flew the dodo in GTA 3, and it's not that the carbon is "only available in black" it's made of carbon fiber, which is why it's called the carbon, which is why it is only black
Putting into perspective how how amazing the graphics are going to be, at 07:36 it is basically the same intro to CSI Miami, and it looks 100 times clearer.
The german b is pronounced as an "S" i.e. PISSWASSER, not PIBWASSER
PC player here but im not waiting an extra year for this.  Gonna go snag me a console soon!
Lucia is like kendall jenner with little kim
No wonder why the development takes long time
The tattoo guy in the trailer is actually Wade Herbert from GTA 5 Trevor’s ally 👍🏻
GTA is basically a parody of real life
This is the type of content we needed to see! Awesome attention to detail. Thanks IGN!
X
"We don't know what Lucia's partner's name is" yeah, right😂
you can't just start calling it snapmatic because you saw the colour yellow on the follow button.
They have a rolls Royce Cullinan damn can't wait
People are going to get lost in these games with vr integration
It's crazy that even as adults this still make us feel like kids again 😳
2:02 sea turtles!
blud thinks every woman is the main character
WHY tf a girl is protagonist
thankyou so much for this
Catalan Blvd no m'ho puc creure
Word to word stolen from a different video. Gj IGN
Excellent breakdown IGN! Thank you!
Vice city has always been my favorite ! So happy to return
Imma be fuckin wit them Zoes fasho
no other game can get close to rockstars details,2025 may be a long time but it surely worth the wait
There isn’t anything quite like a rockstar game, game-defining experiences. So very excited.
bro you forgot about the kids in the background by the muddy place
Pretty sure running down a dream was san andreas, not vice city
unbelievable.
can wait see real map it may be even 2x biger that we can wait
Is it me or the guy looks like Tommy?
The game is gonna be legendary
So this is GTA VI(ce City).
im going to enjoy this game at 5 fps
Thanks for the deep details IGN ❤️🙌
Would we get a version for the PS4 Slim ?
15:13 mega mundo is possibly refering to telemundo
PC gamers are always left on tha sidelines 😢
Welcome to Rockstar Metaverse ❤
10:04 LMAOO THIS SHI SO ACCURATE 😂😂
9:46 👌
it's not a piBwasser but it reads pisswasser
Chris Hansen does alot of stuff in Florida
So is it Jason and Lucia? Switching like in gta V or we don’t know yet
"Pibwasser"? Makes me wonder if Americans have been missing out on the joke for all this time :D
11:11 not sure about the "undercover" nature of that police raid... they do have police written right on their back
the rule 34 is gonna go wild!!!!
It's not Pibwasser, it's not a B it's à German character called "Esstzet", and it's pronounced "PissVasser"
7:12 mf that’s kodak black😂😂
My bet these are all cutscenes.
30 fps lock and no mods?  meh I'll wait for a normal version
Much better than GameSpots trailer breakdown
Looks amazing can't wait to play this game!
twerk and nudity and bikini.
Where is messi in rockstar miami
Street takeovers are not car culture
Goodluck to any game that’s released on 2025
gators not crocs
It might just be me but if we pause the video at 17:47, Lucias partner looks a bit like nilo bellic from the side.
❤💯
To much for just 91 seconds
Running down a dream was in the Gta:SA soundtrack
biggest game reveal in the history of gaming. hope it it doesnt disappoint
ANY RELEASE DATE FOR PC?
Did anyone notice that Jason looks a lot like Arthur Morgan or niko bellic while he is in the car in that angle or that view 😮
Runnin’ Down a Dream was featured in GTA San Andreas not Vice City.
It's "Pisswasser", not Pibwasser.
GTA 6 online is going to be the micro transaction king especially with GTA 5 online micro tractions bringing in enough to cover the cost of GTA 6 production and then some. Let's hope they at least have story DLC's again because GTA 5 could have done some great storylines.
Man im so excited to wait for another 2 years for the game and even longer for it to come out on pc
This trailer is gonna be studied for years
18:12 we can see the face of Argentinian elected president Javier Milei, with a mustache, on the door! 🇦🇷
Finally we can see car bypass and see other vehicles in side mirror😂😂😂 hopefully Tommy Vercetti in game🙂
Well done IGN!
When this game releases, people will not leave they're houses for days, weeks, MONTHS. And rightfully so lol
14:12 This woman reminds me that she is maybe karen ...
all that is missing is a Theo Von radio station. the perfect host for all this chaos...
17:08 pibwasser
The old man on the boat is Jeff Bezoos
Really hoping the game features some of the characters from GTA 5 but like aged ten years that would be cool to see where they all went after the end and to see which of the endings is considered cannon.
GTA 6 is going to change how video games are made and played imo
Do guys think we are able to move our accounts over🤔
Cerveza borracho means beer drunk 😅
You missed the ‘PC TBD’ onscreen text which indicates that there will in fact be a PC release at some point.  Here’s hoping it has native VR support.
Imagine if gt6 would let players create a customized avatar of themselves to be played in the game. That would be be a game changer!
game will be super limited, less traffic, less animals, less trees, less npc's , less cars. They always do this with every gta ga,me
For me that have spent countless hours playing GTA Vice City, this game will be very special. Can't wait
"we will no longer accept cash stored in underwear"
It started with 10, then it was 20, 25, 50, 75, and finally 99 😆 internet really ate up each and every frame
“Running Down a Dream” was in San Andreas OST.
Imagine picking if want have kids or pick role how start the game you in jail tell you how got in jail or start off working 9to 5 and you working build life for you be nice to do cpr training etc train on job work at hotel help with bags
U guys don't seem to understand that a trailer is not gameplay
as soon as the first experience is experienced it can't be experienced again😢
Is her partner not called Jason?
Imagine how awesome it would be for the game to have random events like this car meetup in the middle of the crossroad
How many main characters are in the game?
Not the 99 details 😂 trynna milk that 1 min vid
It's PiSSwasser my guy. Not PiB. Also the bikini lady is definitely not Lucia, just compare the freckles on her face smh.
The gawk gawk 5000 everyone is doing over this game is hilarious.
Brilliant breakdown . Best on yt
This video is so sick. Fantastic finds dude
Huge respect to the folks at IGN for this level of detailed breakdown. Providing the goods for us nerds 👌🤙
The hair physics and body styles make me really curious when it comes to gym / eating. Amount of detail is mesmerizing
Imagine their gameplay trailer is equivalent to an old mobile game graphics just to tease us more
at 14:10 u forgot the side by side
did you say no pc version? WTF
Look how the suspension rebounds at 8:20 when the guy gets out of the car. Amazing Detail
Nice, great analysis!
the dodo's from gta 3
1. Waiting for a gym as it was in GTA SA 2. Waiting for actual social network like TikTok in the game integrated where people can record activity and post online + mobile companion app where you can track activities and send reactions.
Just hoping for all this to transfer over to the actual gameplay and for the frame rate not to be be choppy
What's most insane is that they believe a console-only release is still a viable business strategy in the 2020's. Wild
10:00 The ATC tower would be the bigger tower to the right
This will be huge when it drops
No wonder they took 10 plus years to release the trailer, the details are mindblowing. Thanks for breaking it down IGN.
Will we finally get the jetpack we all want
pc release in 2026 💀
lmao he said 'piBwasser'
malibu club needs to make a comeback
Couldn't find a 100th eh?
why not 100!
10:17 is it just me or it's ricardo diaz mansion/Vercetti estate on the background?
your kids must be scared from you fs buddy so does your wife🤣
Rockstar edging us with gta 6 fr
Vice city a little lame.
Comes out on PS5, looks like the trailer on PS6 two years after release. Looks like we're buying this game twice boys
Running Down a Dream was on San Andreas, not Vice City.
16:30 Should be a remaster to poke fun of Rockstar taking a decade to make a new GTA
I'm buying a ps5 just for this game !
gta 5 trailer was so much better
Do you think this will be 60fps?
2025? So pc plyr must wait 2030😂
Can’t wait to be back to Vice city! 🏙️ 👏🏼👏🏼🌴🌊🐊
They better have a Florida Man missions or storyline 😂😂
You guys really couldn't be bothered to use the actual vice city map instead of that terrible fake one? lol
Damn how many videos y’all going to milk out of one trailer
please , allow us to swim . 😌
Did you really read Pißwasser as pibwasser
GTA and Florida Man is a marriage made in sweet sweet video game haven.
The girl in the bikini is proven to be Lucia. Moles match, same earrings, nose and eyebrows
17:08 IT'S PISWASSER NOT PIBWASSER 😭😭
Online is gonna be wild
11:17 You forgot to mention Jason in the cap, who breaks down the door
Arrest Andrew 😂😂
That rolls royce with the nagasaki,looks very real
Jason looks alot like Arthur Morgan from RDR2
thats not pibwasser its pisswasser
18:50 Running Down a Dream wasn't on the Vice City soundtrack, it was on the San Andreas soundtrack
Just imagine if the trailer was 3min long... "77,888.5 details you might have missed"
This game is going to be game of the year 2025 and 2026.
My only disappointment is that they were hardly any guns to see details of during the trailer, just hoping a bunch of weapons from online will make it to story mode because a lot of cars from online are in the trailer.
We need that everglades guy (@fishinggarett) searching that burmese python in this game, it will be iconic
Rockstars ability to spin sarcasm and satire into a living game is just incredible.
Currently playing through gta 5 on ps5 Traffic feels more packed but this is another level
oh cool even ign does trailer analysis videos now........ SMH
everyone be milking gta vi lol
Now this is an actual 7/10 trailer at best.
In the thrillbillies scene, two kids can be seen playing in the mud in the background.
17:09 lmao it's not 'pib'wasser
Was that someone surfing in the beach scene to the far right when zoomed out ?
Ps5 pro by 2025 💯
one things for sure, its gon be crazy.
Alligators surely no?
the beach part where sands sticking their foot is some serious details right there.
The game looks absolutely stunning! Truly fantastic. 🙌
5:16 that building to the left is the Kaseya Center
How can you find details of a game that still haven’t decided what and how to make it yet
If only you hadn't butchered the visuals with 1080p, one could even see the details you are talking about.
Insane realism and graphics! Hyped!!
In all its 30 FPS glory eh.
Cannot wait for this man, the hype is crazy with this one it’s going to break records.
lmao generic and shi++y breakdown, GTA SV does it much better, smh
I'm pretty sure that white Cheetah Classic in the ocean view hotel scene is a nod to Miami Vice with the white Testarossa. Original GTA VC had cops in Cheetahs, maybe we will have a cop drive that in this game too?
it's push limit PS5/XBox Series X hardware
That guy looks like a young robert deniro
Excellent Trailer breakdown ❤
Don’t wanna be that one guy but a lot of first trailers that come out of the game most of the time it’s not gonna be the same, ever heard of click bait…. well guess what trailer bait is a thing why do u think the game is gonna release on 2025 lol it’s not close to finish plus the main creators of gta have left rockstar
Still kinda disappointed that they didn’t use blinding lights as the theme
it's pronounced pisswasser
Alligators not crocodiles!!! Lol
Literally the first trailer and we already have over 100 stuff to find. That's Rockstar for you!
It's was a 1:31 trailer and IGN really milking it to get a 20 minute 99 things you missed 😂
Love it
amazing job callling out all the right stuff -- eg the unfinished bridge, hair physics, weather effects. great eye!
So nobody else see the aventador?
Is lucia the one on the bikini that posed?
y'all really shined light on many things that went right over my head! Thank you! So stoked!
*alligators  not crocodiles.  smh
This time i'm gonna buy me a ps5 just for this. Having to wait for the pc port can kill me...
Dodge Challenger not charger
people on reddit are saying that the first shot with the freeway and the tall tower is actually Tampa because that's what it is irl. So that city in the background is Tampa!
perfect job matching scenes from the trailer with the original youtube clips they came from, as well as overall analysis! great work! mandatory reading next to the GTA VI first trailer lol
Graphics look average nothing screams amazing looks like a remastered gta 5 for a game that took that long to make
GTA VI is a Wokey Karen simulator, the enemies are probably toxic masculinity and rightwing groups and main antagonist is an 1n C3L Lord hahah :D
the first ever gta game that im not excited for, and wont even buy or play... Having a fem protag in a crime world game like GTA hahah what a joke :D
Is it me or does the male protagonist resemble Jim Caviezel?
finally we can drift realisticly
Is it possible for Rockstar to reduce the views over eighteen years old?
can't wait for GTA 7
How could Michael Mann's Miami Vice be a key inspiration for the original Vice City when it came out years after the game??
Imagine living in miami for 23 years and seen these☺️
Nowhere in the trailer Rockstar claims it is in-game footage. It could be pre-rendered….
Like when in gta3 our character didn’t talk but kind of was a protection body guard type of player
"Running Down a Dream" was on San Andreas' soundtrack, not Vice City's.
with no other games to work on, a PC port will probably come in less than a year. it only took a year to port RDR2 and they were still dropping RDO updates, huge GTAO updates and early development of GTA VI probably was going on then too. plus, they have more devs now, so I'd expect a PC port <6 months after release
This just made me less patient about GTA VI
This looks so cool, it’s like Vice City in our era.
Dude. The face tattoo guy looks so real
Wait for 10gb vram needed for recommended requirements
Hopefully they have some PSVR2 content
Come on now we know his name is Jason from the links last year .... 🙄 if Lucia's name is correct you know his is too amazing looking game tho
Las Venturas and San Fierro are the only 2 cities from previous generations that never made it to the new generations of GTA (YET).
It’s pronounced pisswasser not piBwasser FYI 😊
❤
Can't wait for GTA VII
99? Wtf 😂
Then gta7 will be released in about 20-25 years because gta6 will also be milked to death.
Idk how PS5 and Xbox X|S will handle the game smoothly. Next versions (Pro) of the consoles have to come out to play it smooth.
There was a Lamborghini on road next to the chetttah
This trailer will be milked to death by every living soul while we wait for 2025
"That woman right there is a G-cup user"
Amazing job finding all these details IGN! Here's one you might have missed: 13:52 Look to the left, and for the first time....GTA may have kids as npcs.
99 details and the release year  aint a great one 😭  (aint too bad tbh)
Crystlers
Hopefully ... there will NEVER be a PC version . Ever ... EVER !!!! EVERRRRRRRRR !!!!
J A S O N
It could be released in March or April 2025. That’s when spring break is held in Miami
holy hell the knowledge here is incredible
It'd be hard to play gta6 with only one hand🧑🏻‍🦯
2:46 too close man
that's a Haitian fella for sure on the left at 7:24.
The ankle tag will restrict access to areas of the map. That seems kind of obvious. Clever idea from Rockstar. More natural than "closing a bridge"
Awesome breakdown ❤
Do we think there will be lots more interior environments?
The 'partner' is called Jason. We've known this for over a year
Why apartment purchase only online? All purchase should be in story mode also
GTA Online should have GTA 5 AND 6 interlocked together
The level of detail is crazy sick! Can’t wait to see gameplay
What's really telling is IGN using a leaked map, but not the most accurate one... Obviously they couldn't use real leaks, so they go for the second best approximation
running down the dream was on san andreas, not vice city..
On 8:36 you mean dodge challenger
Damn IGN y’all did your homework
Messi & Inter Vice will be appear on Trailer 2 GTA 6.
You can even see the sand sticking to the npc’s feet, now that is some detail.
Ngozi, this is the best breakdown video I’ve come across
0:36  6 birds flying
Ltes GOOOOOOOOO!!! 🎉
Pibwasser 😂
is this a game?
Pisswasser :D
Lucia Da Cruz?
Another detail at 15:00 is that Rockstar has added Leonida Highway Patrol with the tan and black cruisers based off FHP. Looks like there is going to be many different police agencies from different jurisdictions in the game.
Mafia 2 > Gta 6
😂It's not Pibwasser it's Pisswasser like actual piss
Im wondering if its going to be alot of stuff but nothing  to do vibe that gta 5 had  not being  able to enter buildings  etc
Ever heard of 4K? Cause this ain't it!
the hype is maddd yk
Strangers and freaks missions are gonna be crazy, flawda man missions 😂😂😂
Bro im jealous florida got its own video game 😬
It almost looks like a movie
this info is so wrong, that is not the WTVY tower... that tower isnt even near Miami, which this shot is... its on Krome Ave near the prison... whole video is uncredible.... and Brickell pronounced Brickle
This is an insane amount of research considering the one day you’ve had, impressive
I’m curious if you can go to Cuba
The only downgrade is having two characters instead of 3
They can take my kidney all they want. ❤
Can't wait for you to be wrong about this too!!
IGN be like: "and in this easter egg, we see an airplane in the air, just like the kinds that people fly, which is an obvious callback to the other GTAs where they had airplanes that did, in fact, fly."
Rockstar love their small details
Three words to describe Rockstar… attention to detail. 🔥
What a time to be alive
The broken piece of bridge in wild shot looks a like the one that the Arnie blew up in true Lies
Since it is based on story of the real life criminal couple Bonnie and Clyde. They are killed in the end. So does that mean.....
Crazy
Crocodiles 😂😂 we do have them here, but Alligators are what are is known in FL.
*the cabronizzare is based on the Ferrari California
you can see the improvements in graphics when you can't identify which comparison  is real or not
This man thinks a radar dish on a tower is a ATC 💀
😂😂 everyone trying to out each other "1 million things you didn't notice in the GTA trailer"
Im hypedd.
.
Next gen twerking
Super glad they’re taking their time in the game and aren’t rushing it. Unlike COD and EA
the “piBwasser” really threw me off. it is pisswasser lol
Nice work ign, you uncovered tons of details. So excited for this
Just hoping we can buy property on GTA 6 OFFLINE and can go inside the building as well
Can't wait gta 7
🤩
Very cool trailer 🤩
Alligators* not crocodile’s
It's just what you love about RockstarGames, details are just awesome
*Alligators
Can't wait...
20 years until gta 7😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The graphics are top notch! All in game visuals .
The clip was freaking 1 minute long, how yall seeing almost a 100 Easter eggs????
Exclusive first for console 😂
2025 is a joke
Maybe the opening gameplay of gta6  is jailbreak in gta5 the opening is robbing
Rockstar is the perfect example of Quality over Quantity and thats why they succeed.
What stopped you at 99?
Why do you think that it's not just a cinematically enhanced version of the game? There is no statement in the video (like they usually do) that everything you see is in-game.
17:08 My dude really just pronounced Pisswasser as "Pibwasser"...
PiBwasser? My guy, that's a German Eszett. It's basically just two Ses. So, it's pronounced PissVasser.
Randam as hell but imagine a modern saint denis in a gta game
8:36 bro said dodge charger…
Lucia looks hot 🍑
I'm surprised nobody's mentioned the larger moving ships in any videos I've seen yet. We're usually limited to very small boats to freely drive around, but we've seen huge cargo barges and super yachts actively moving around and not just sitting in place.
crazy how you noticed all of this😮‍💨
I’m actually curious about the kids in the back of the thrill billy scene on the left. Is there gonna be kids in GTA6 or is it just a scene only thing?
The hype and anticipation for this game is unreal!
Just to clarify, running down a dream from Tom Petty actually was in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Radio Station known as KDST
The guns they use in the store in the final shot are interesting. the male guy's gun looks similar to GTA V's basic pistol, but Lucia's appears to have a Glock style gun. maying they remodeled the combat pistol from five to be a Glock?
Let's make a video of 20 min about a trailer of 1 min about a game who isn't realising in 2023 or 2024 but in 2025 at an unknown date ( could be December 2025 )
12:34 the crotch guys door handles have been duct taped. DUCT TAPE ON DOOR HANDLES.... daaaaaamn, the detail
As a Native Floridian Im super hyped
2:45 clueless xD surely its a club
the faces look weird, so does the way people move
Shame Ray Liotta died would have been so cool to meet an older Tommy Vercetti in Vice City see how he was getting on
Did bro really say Pibwasser instead of Pißwasser (ß=ss)
sweet we're gon have sharks eating people at the beach
A lot of people are so ungrateful to Rockstar. Complaining that they took so long to make GTA 6.  They had other projects besides GTA 6. Like their previous game Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA online updates. Making those took a lot of time and money. So of course making GTA 6 would take a long time.
part of HISTORY ❤
It's "BRICK-uhl", not "brick-ELL". The everglades are home to _mostly_ alligators, not crocodiles.
すごい
8:35 - Dodge Challenger, not Charger, but not a big deal.
Co-op??? The theme is "sticking together".
Incredible Detail Discovery
Miami doesn’t have an airport sign only in bad boys🤣🤣🤣
If we don’t get visible rocket launches I’ll be disappointed
im pretty sure runnin down a dream by petty, was in san andreas not vice city
This breakdown is amazing ❤
Quite possibly will be the most hyped up video game of all time when it starts getting closer to it's release.
Lucia!!!!!😝😝
East or West GTa 6 will beast
"urrmm sir 17:29 thats a turbo sabre actually" 👆🤓
Haiti gangs will be making a come back
☠️🫥☠️😇⚜️🤴🏽⚜️🌍🌚⛩️🫴🏼💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎☄️H3AV3NZ[]ALWR1GHTZ[L0C
thank you for this 99 details video :)
Gta 7 all 3 cities
It's PISSWASSER, not Pipwasser, lol
You guys missed the fact that there are now kid npc’s
Vice Beach logo is identical to the Miami Beach logo
the dad bod squad scene. that girl on the boat looks like the girl from the rooftop party in the white bathing suit
Watch Jason be an undercover cop
The apartment building with the hole in it is actually based off "The Gabriel Miami Downtown"
Can’t wait for 2025
the milking shall begin folks!!!
Fun fact, the release gap between 5 and 6 is the same as 3 and 5
This makes me forgot about gta trilogy exist Lol
lol that building with a hole in it, is a actual building not a homage
Vice City/Stories were always my fav GTA’s, just couldnt get in to any of the other ones, so this is unbelievably exciting for me. Still a while off though, so im gonna stop thinking about it for now.
*Cyberpunk did it better*
It's supposed to be pronounced "pisswasser"
Bro said Crocodile 🤦🏻‍♂, there's only Alligators in Florida
Rockstar is ripping off real footage of crazy people in Florida because they are: A: creatively lazy and lost too power with Dan House leaving or :B: are too worried about "punching down" with their jokes so this is a cop out from actually creating nuance and parody
These dense population really makes the game lively gta 5 felt lonesome
at 8:41 it’s a dodge challenger instead of a charger
Bro said Pibwasser
bric kell avenue lol,  dale county is "dale" in spanish but also a play on dade county
This is already game of the decade
So we’re gonna ignore the new jiggle physics?
18:52 no, Petty's Running Down a Dream wasn't featured in the original Vice City soundtrack, it was in San Andreas
damn, video take straight up from the Strange Man
Anyone else noticed the cameras following Jason and Lucia in the liquor store
Details is useless in trailer until they show it at the end product
The male characters name is jason. Its confirmed.
17:10 it's pisswasser not pibwasser
Its amazing how wrong this guy is on so many things smh
Alligators not crocodiles you nitwit
30fps
A new gamer term: ‘Subscription babies’ - Someone unfortunate who can’t own any physical media).
GTA V with extra steps.
Brandon hart
my guy just said pibwasser
I'm not gonna buy it if there's no 20ft Burmese phyton in it
Dad bod is Adam harts song with same name and video
Lucia partner name is ‘Jason’
No kids NPCs again
17:09 Pißwasser is read Pisswasser. Just wanted to point that out 😀
Can’t wait for this! It’s going to be an absolute banger! Roll on 2025!!
My life will officially be over when the new gta comes out 😂😂 I can just imagine all the alien/ufo Easter Eggs, references to real life mysterys, hidden collectibles, secret locations the lot!
Still can't sync lips Seriously?
That is outta this wolrd
For those who still want to explore Vice City in HD universe for now, play NFS Heat. Palm City looks very beautiful at night, not bad at all. Looks better with mods.
Karens, Social and atualsocial media, ih boy, rockstar are the best!
SOOOOO many blatant mistakes.... how does anyone take ign seriously
“Pißwater” is pronounced pisswater dude. It’s what makes it so funny. Not pibwater haha.
Tom Petty is also from Florida
Sadly PC gamers will wait atleast 2 more years for PC version
She looks like sara saffari
17:10 Its piSSwasser ffs, its called a ringel-S
No one:  Lindsay Lohan: Thats me at 9:39 !!!!
13:34 😂😂😂
Is GTA VI next gen exclusive?
It's been all but confirmed Lucia's boyfriend's name is Jason
well, look whos back.
It would be crazy if Lionel Messi is referenced in the game
If lucia is in jail does that mean if we get arrested we might have to go through a rehab thing if we wanna get out and has to face devier constituency if we break out ?
Very thorough awesome spotting on the little things
This makes Starfield look pathetic
The details are insane bro the homeless dude had a iguana on his shoulder 😂
Choopers were first in gta 1 get your facts right ign. The first helicopters players could use was in vice city
pc nerds, enjoy waiting 3 years  bahahhaha
Ya missed the deer 🦌
Im excited about the game but the next thing im excited about is where is the next gta game gonna take place at? Texas? (Since they already have the map model from rd2) Washington? Chicago?
Interesting.
Actually its mocking CNN thats whynthe banner and everything is red, not blue like Fox.
As a Floridian guys it's not actually THAT crazy.  You'd be lucky to see half of that 😂
kliksphilips has entered the chat
Tom Petty's Running Down a Dream was in GTA San Andreas. Specifically on the radio station K-DST. It wasn't in Vice City.
Valimai movie released ✔️ Now way home movie released ✔️ GTA 6 trailer released ✔️ Inum MC host face reveal thaa balance 🥺
8:35 thats a Challenger bud
Pibwaser 💀
All the Green cars, reference to the families, red bandanas, blue bandanas, bout to have a lot of different gangs in this one
Please Rockstar don't make me play as a female influencer
427th Commented 💙
So GTA 6 is not coming on PC so it’s only coming on Xbox in PlayStation
dear lord it’s been not even 2 days 😭
Cant wait for trailer 2
The wood bridge in thrill Billie’s scene is the bridge at REDNECK YATCH CLUB
i’m already thinking of all the mods
FYI, Miami is in Miami-Dade County. Vice-Dale County is the parody
It's like all the gaming channels are having a competition to see who can pick out the most details 😭😂
How does that Damn Radio Tower Survive all those Damn Hurricanes? 🤔
this kinda reminds me of stone ocean
Sound for Sound is referencing an audio channel by the name of (Down for Sound "D4S") and his channel "TheLifeOfPrice" that shows off and sells high end audio equipment especially for subwoofer DB competitions.
The New Rockstars did better deep and diverse easter eggs breakdown.
I'm gonna call it now based on red dead, it's coming out in 2026 after 1 maybe 2 delays
Over sexualised
13:26 if this dude is from a gang he is jamaican
Basically this is Just GTA vice City Definitive Edition 😂 a vice City with lots of free land surrounding it. 🙎🤦
Pißwasser is pronounced as "Pisswasser" not "Pibwasser"
Wow so many, this gonna be massive open world games in 2025
The amount of money Rockstar is about to make from this game is probably going to be mind numbing. Rightfully so though, they're one of the few gaming companies that actually takes their time and puts out quality, polished, and nearly perfect video games. CANT FRIGGIN WAIT DUDE
With the amount of new pc players since the release of the 30 series rtx cards, if they don't release on pc within the same year, especially since the game was made and tested on pc (rtx20/rtx30 series specifically), that would be so scummy and greedy.
Give Cliff some narration credit!
this is gonna be game of the year this is gonna be “game of the next 10 years until gta 7 comes out”
Great video thanks for the details🫡
The game is a masterpiece
Any looting
Cool breakdown.  Yall should bring back Rewind Theater again.
Your research team is insane.
This was an awesome breakdown compared to IGN’s break down of GTA V first trailer. “Hey look it’s Tommy Vercetti“😂
15:30 could it be that they’re poking fun at rappers who self snitch in their music? 😂
2025 :/
17:08 To IGN and the rest of my American friends: Pißwasser is pronounced as Pisswasser. Not Pib.
First
8:36 That's a challenger not a charger.
Let me ask you something; How do you KNOW, FOR SURE, of certain details you're mentioning without proper fact checking? How do you KNOW the prison staff member's name is actually Stephanie and not something else? Who told you this? You can't even read her nametag because of the resolution. Some of these "facts" you're telling us don't seem really factual...
2 years is nothing
There was a snake in the everglades. Hoping for some legendary creatures like rdr2
BRICKell not bricKELL
Fun fact Tom Petty is from Florida as well
Not sure why we are judging CGI cut scenes but ok....
99 details from just 1,30 minutes trailer?, what a fantastic game.
The map is going to be absolutely huge. At least 3 confirmed counties, Kelly County, Leonard County, and Vice Dale County. The cities will be huge and insanely detailed.
hey zoomers, theres no crocodiles in north america
4:40 - Michael Mann's Miami Vice came out four years after GTA Vice City, so I'm pretty confident the movie wasn't an inspiration for the game.
They got the Equilibrium drug in GTA 6 😮
If you think about it, this is just  120+ years after John Marston , Arthur Morgan  and the Van Der Linden gangs story.
9:06 that bridge exists in real life lmao, its an old railroad bridge.
8:38 King Cobra JFS and Puff the Bearded Dragon... Look him up.
Gta 6 will deliver his world right unlike cyberpunk at release
Ride Out Customs is on most the modded cars, definitely a confirmed car shop!
Superb analysis
Profissional Detail IGN in 12:40 Michael Jackson
BERMUDA TRIANGLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Still wondering if the female is the main character or if you can choose between them...
Well done on all the details spotted - it's amazing how much details one can pick out from just a trailer. One can only imagine how many more we will find in future trailers and in-game too.  Just a note - the song "Running Down A Dream" was featured in San Andreas, not Vice City
Even a 4080 might not be enough to run this in ultra settings.
15:50
alligators*
No way he called a dodge challenger a charger
Rockstar is filling shoes the size of which aren't sold in most retailers.
If GTA6 doesn't have a parody of OnlyFans called LonelyFans, I'll be disappointed.
This is 20 minute video for a 90 second trailer…. 20 MINUTES
2025 enter  the chat   BTW: Trailers and cinematics always looks better than actual game...
This is exactly what sets Rockstar apart. All the frigging details.
Wonder how many suicides gta 6 trailer has delayed
Tourism in Florida 📈
"Running Down a Dream" came in GTA  San Andreas
Can it run gta VI. is gonna be the new thing 😭
Rockstar really rocks when it comes to gaming
also one more little detail, you can see that the sand sticks to your feet when you're walking or running in the beach  at 2:19
Im excited but lets remember this isnt gameplay footage. So we will see what all will make it into the game.
Guess I'm finally buying a new gaming console! Goodbye Xbox 360!
really hope there is a theme park, like a deranged disney world
Where are they getting this map from? Is this confirmed?
I’m confused "Florida" does exist in the 3D and HD universe
18:02 *Jason*
GTA 7 will be the Matrix
damn from 10 to 15 to 20 to 99 detail.. next wil be 1000 detail
Running down a dream was in San Andreas not Vice City
Running Down A Dream by Tom Petty wasn't in Vice City, it was in San Andreas's "K-DST" radio station
That guy with Lucia almost looks like that guy from GTA 4
Imagine killing somone and someone else sees it and film it like in red dead a witness
Vice Dale County is most likely based on Miami-Dade County and is most likely the county where Vice City itself is located. Personal hope is we get a GTA5 style standoff between the various sheriff offices and VCPD.
The girl in the white bikini is indeed Lucia.
I'm praying for Trevor Phillips to make an appearance.
Why are you so quiet: GTA 6, strippers ,hooker's.......
You missed Peggy Gou, a South Korean DJ.
They better drop a PC version at launch. No way I’m buying this game a year after launch. Definitely not downgrading to a console just for this game either.
All of that in depth analysis and you get alligators wrong?
What happened to Tommy Verseti?
Hats off to IGN for doing the heavy lifting with this level of meticulous research. These trailer breakdowns reveal so much about a game.
Michael Mann’s Miami Vice (2006) was a key inspiration for the original Vice City (2002)? What?
For a game that took 12 years to make graphics are super disappointing, looks exactly the same as 5. Hopefully gameplay looks better when it releases
Usually don't rely on IGN for quality but this one was very well done.
I'm surprised everyone is assuming Lucia being in prison is the beginning... could be anywhere in the game! Very exciting!
it would be nice if jason (or whatever) was an animal lover and he had a photo album of all the animals he has (a kind of compendium from rdr2), and let that be an activity.  to take pictures of all the animals, but maybe that's not the way of the gta saga
gta 5 with rdr 2 graphics
ROCKSTAR IS AHEAD OF FUTURE
The fact that the buff guy running has more sand on his feet and the sand detail of every little footstep is wild
We got a reference to Niko in GTA 5. Here's hoping we get at least a reference to Michael and or Trevor and or Franklin, but we absolutely HAVE to get at the very least a reference to Tommy in this game.
The sound4sound sticker is probably a reference to the down4sound shop, it’s a company that sells high end audio equipment (think subwoofers and stuff)
Why all the ppl are black in this game ok we understand black life matters but its toi much
Research Ops team IGN it sounds they are creating gaming data science a new industry
Cant wait to play this in 6 years
2025 release, still a very long way to go (probably at least 2 years) 😰!.
Great video but your car knowledge is very much lacking and incorrect
Classic IGN
The second helicopter is actually the Buckingham SuperVolito, introduced in GTA V Executive update
As a life long spl car audio guy. That sound 4 sound sticker is a parody of Down4Sound also known as Johnathan price on youtube
Boardwalk is based on the breakwater hotel not the colony
🤩 Would be awesome if eventually you could travel between cities in GTA Online via the airports.  Vice City to Los Santos to Liberty City.
11:44 you forgot the npc was filling his car with gas at the gas station, which means our cars can be filled with gas
But isn't it render footage so details don't matter at all untile actual game play comes out ??
You missed one. on the stack of money shes holding, if you look at the serial number. its most likely a developers kids birthday or a release date for something in the past idk.
Remember when the game leaked and people were saying it looks like the same game as GTA5… 😂  Why do people set themselves up to fail
For all we know it could come out 2025 December. that would be 2 whole years, please don’t do that to us Rockstar! Great looking game btw!  Now we wait!
8:35 Challenger 🤦‍♂
Not a fan of Female protagonists, just makes everything more unreal lol (No offence ladies and all the fairytale creatures out there)
The fact that I’m drunk and there were scenes they used in this video that took me a second to figure out whether it was the game or a real life clip of Miami is insane.
Why 69 when you can nine-one-nine? Man, I'm in love with GTA VI already, lol.
You missed green Lamborghini 🎉
No one does it better than rockstar
why aren't there more studios like rockstar? never plahed a bad rockstar gaem
Any news  about the crypto rumor that was floating around a couple months back?
Looks like RDR 2023
Online only
This GTA may outlive 2 generations of consoles, again.
The only detail that matters…no PC at launch. Console players will likely be stuck playing this at 30 fps.
99 details that's so small....try my 100 details from GTA 6.
Going to be interesting how they incorporate coop.
wtf interpolation
Maybe just me but Lucia partner voice sounds like Nathan Drake from uncharted
It’s going to end like Bonnie and Clyde. Both will probably die in the end.
Not divershitty enough
Dude said "pibwasser"
Bonnie and Clyde type of story maybe? perhaps there will be split screen?
Release date: December 31st 2025
Lucia isn't the only protagonist. Jason is too :)
The train bridge in the keys is a real thing. It’s derelict. Watch True Lies please.  Other than that, this is insanely thorough. Thank you!
The trickster logo can be seen on with window as well.
That’d be alligators, not crocodiles 😉
Nobody knows Jasons Name 😂
gta  not game  real lıfe !
Who wishes that GTA 6 setting was set back to the 80s ?
Meh 🫤. Not really interested.
Here’s a detail you missed. San Andreas takes place 12 years before the release of San Andreas and GTAV will be 12 years old on GTA6’s release. 😮
Damn, what is Clint doing here? 😂
Gta6 release on 08; August '2025
Wow, this breakdown is spot on and detailed. Kudos to folks from IGN team who researched every single bit!
Was enjoying the video until the narrator mentioned some incorrect information (for someone who apparently enjoyed Vice City). Running down a dream was in San Andreas, never in Vice City. Clearly forgot or didn’t play the game. Also the guys name is confirmed to be Jason.
the little beach ranger
The guys name is Jason the other character we can play as
Wow. And they still have another year or so to perfect it! RDR2 was next level back in 2018. So this will be monumental!! 🔥
No children? 😩😩😩😩
they need lower the sexual visuals on the game
How does IGN not know the male is Jason? “We don’t know his name”
GTA  story still is in America..I wonder gta 5 types of gameplay with new wrapper..same boring thing
8:37 challenger not charger
Just right when you think cyberpunk at his lowest point😂😂
“Display of rockstar’s hair technology” 9:30 yeah that’s what we were all thinking👍😂
We have to wait a year for this gold 😢
If my boy Benny ain’t makin’ a cameo, I’m goin’ be real disappointed.
Bro is clickbaiting already
Running down a dream was in SA not VC
Feel so proud to be a part of rockstar india
13:50 are those kids in the background????
🤞 please no delays. Rockstar is known for that.
Didnt the leaked gta 6 stuff we have seen months ago, show that we would get two main characters? This trailer kinda proofs that. Lucia and her partner.
Here we go
🔥
Can we get a different rockstar game while we wait 👀
Tom Petty  is also a Florida native!
I've never heard the GTA universe refered to as the "HD Universe", where does that come from?
Its a challenger not a charger
When does it GTA VI Arrive to PC?
"It truly has been an honor boys"
@3:55 You can see sand being kicked up when they're running and sand stuck to eveyones feet, now that's attention to detail.
Can’t wait to see my Haitians in this game 🙏🏾❤️🇭🇹🥹🥹🥹, interactions with this game will be CRAZY!!! 7:15
Can't wait for gta7
We need a third crazy protagonist like Trevor
This game is gonna be CRAZY lol!
They actually built miami better than real miami 😅😅
Hearing u break down this video is so satisfying
This video was written by someone that has never been to south Florida
And who’s looking forward to see if they incorporated the infamous “Faggio” to dip around the city with?
Nice breakdown IGN Writter! , cant wait for the trailer 2 breakdown ♥
Thats actually a real broken bridge in miami that was most famously used in the movie true lies. Surprised ign missed that.
bro why wont it be on PC, My pc is way faster than a console.
Runnin down a Dream was on San Andreas not Vice City.
Where is the oppressor mark 2
Gonna crash and be buggy.
it’s crazy how there’s so much detail with just a 1 minute and 30 second video
It's gonna take like 30 years for every other game developer to catch up to 2023 rockstar
Great job on the video IGN!! 🔥 🙏
Today is a different world, and it's crazy to see how much we've changed.  Gta is a parody of the current state of humanity.
is the map you guys keep showing official or a speculated mock up?
Amazing video!  Petty Forever!
Key detail missed is on the door of the liquor store. Uncle Jack’s is a parody of Flanigan’s. Where the logo is based off Big Daddy’s liquor. A beloved South FL franchise. You can see his face on the door. The details Rock Star puts in is undefeated!!
My biggest fear yesterday was heights!  Today, is dying before GTA6 comes out 😂
Wow si que RockStar nos impresionó, Mis padres dijeron que si tengo 10,000 seguidores me comprarían una cámara profesional para grabar... rogándoles, literalmente rogándoles...
1080p is the new 720p even on 1080p its looks a bit blurry
8:36 So you just ignored that Lambo?
Something about this game is so overwhelming it gives me goosebumps
gta5 had multiple counties too, blaine county and los santos county
Bick-el? It's Brickell.
wish it was 70s'80s, i'm over the modern world lol
Im so excited for the trailer #2 lets go!!
You wanna know the best part? The same people here praising this game were the same ones talking sh*t about rockstar 6 months ago lol
We flew the first DODO plane in Liberty City XD....Legends Know
Rockstar is the biggest game company ever
great video guys everything we need to know 💪
GTA 6 9/19/25
Finnaly a normal game !!! Cant wait
intresting
Nice ign
na época que vi o primeiro trailer do 5 ficou bem melhor no lançamento do jogo, esse já tá bonito imagina o jogo quando sair😱
Been waiting years and got to wait another year…
When this game drops it’s gonna shut the world down
Look at the guy standing next to the cooler on the beach looks like AirPods in his ear🔥🔥🔥🔥
its incredible how you guys made a 20 minute video fromm a 2 minute clip
This is not an ATC tower 🥲🤷🏼‍♂️
What do you mean we don't know his name, it's Jason!
Lucia out here looking thick af
Anyone found Vic Vance yet??? Tommy Vercetti???
Insane how rockstar captures their version of reality so well, absolutely brilliant
Why is weasel news? Akin to Fox News? I’m just curious.
The game that will finally make me spend on a ps5 or xbox
Rockstar basically created Florida the video game 😂
This game is everything Starfield wishes it was
Running down a dream by Tom petty was featured on the GTA San Andreas Soundtrack
Upload in 4k guys
It's insane how Rockstar games have evolved so Amazingly and Beautifully over the past years
9:27 The astonishing display of... hair technology...
It was a Skimmer in Vice City not a Dodo
Who else was kind of underwhelmed by the trailer?   Don’t get me wrong, I’m buying the game. Just asking
damn this should of been released 2024 ......my guesse is if you are in jail it will be like gta V then cuts to being in jail and have to do missions or just short cut sceen either way not shocked they return back vice city and not pick a new city
Alao, vice-dale county is a play on miami-dade county
Looks amazing
Curious what will the Npc will be better reactions
It's Crazy Rockstar went so Above with Gta 6. i'm super hype to play this when it comes out.
If you publish your video in 1080p, Y ou Tube makes it look awful for us viewers these days. Consider raising your resolution.
Searching the comments for the "But actually... on crocodile vs alligator... 😅
Excited for the game , skeptical on Jason
Awesome breakdown!!!!!
Give pc release date
The bridge in the keys that is broken is actually legit. Its based off an old railroad that used to go along the keys until they destroyed the entrance to it when building the highway. If you ever go down there, for a decent chunk of the trip the railroad is right next to you. You can see chunks of it that are broken off
A moment of silence of all those who wait 2 more years.
Lmao at the way he said Brickell
One detail: This game is gonna be Fn LIT
Did anyone notice the dodge challenger police trooper ? 15:00
Crazy how rockstar can stop everything in gaming world with a trailer! BIG BROTHER IS BACK FROM COLLEGE 😂
Confirming my opinion that this isn't just vice city but all of Florida including the pan handle.
you guys forgot the miame heat stadium
Can IGN accept that it has been irrelevant since 2012 and get out of our face. They have nearly 20 mill subscribers and most of their videos struggle to break 50K views, like take a hint…
What about GTA X (10)?
No one is talking about the picture behind Lucia when she is talking to the prison counselor (or the fact that the windows' sun shadow is reflecting off of her glasses.) Maybe it is the lake in the middle of the map with mountains behind it. More area to the map that wasn't shown.
There are more thN 200+ details in the trailer. I've cover all in my latest livestream.
15:35  *Missed Detail* How'd you not mention the baby getting grabbed by a gator? lol
Jason, his name is Jason
Jason is his name
IGN just pretending the leaked information doesnt exist, as to not piss off Rockstar 😂 aww 😂
GTA VI Trailer 1 has almost surpassed (in views) GTA V Trailer 1 in just 1 day.
Who else cant wait to sink countless hours into this game!? 2025 cannot come fast enough!!!
BEEN WAITING YEARS, FINALLY
Get hyped for two years. No thanks
Rumored Ps5 Pro will be out by 2025. Gta6 Ps5 Pro bundle $ony?
hmm
It's a nice concept trailer but I'm waiting for a real one.
99, really?
this is it folks, the is the greatest video game that will ever be made, until gta 7
The Cheetah Classic being white is also likely a reference to Miami Vice tv series, where the main character used a white Ferrari Testarossa (cheetah classic)
Every gamer will be fulfilled enough to die after 1000 hours in this game
Whats crazy is how finished the game already looks, and its still probably like 18 months away from release
I'm happy that that the Voice of Lucia sounds more American its more suitable for a larger Audience
Queda muy feo 99 Detalles, añadiré 1 más. pues bien, digamos que Bob Esponja está oculto bajo el mar.
Why is it that I’m the only one that notices the children in the trailer lol.
there are some graphical problems like the teeth of the woman talking to lucia should be dark because of lighting
3:37 Alligators
Use me as a I’ve watched the trailer more than once button
cant wait for gta 7
I'M HYPED FOR THIS GAME
They got the nerve, the audacity to introduce me to the finest female MC of all time and then make me wait till 2025 to play as her.
💯👏🔥🔥💯
IM SO HYPE
Gaming media and content creators are going to milk the hell out of this game for the next couple years before it even comes out
Alligators, not crocodiles.
Buying a ps5 pro and preorder collectors edition for story mode and then get rtx 4090 for gta 6 online with frnds 🔥🔥 ur freaking amazing rockstar 😭🥰🥰
GOTY 2025, go ahead and book the after party.
wrong, dodo first flyable in GTA3
The trailer wasn't even 99 seconds long was it?! 😂🤦‍♂️
Insane how Rockstar captures their version of reality so well, absolutely brilliant
That Charter Plane quote : Why Sixtynine when you can Nine 1 Nine 💀💀💀
Other YT Channel:  20, 30, 15 things found or you missed in GTA 6 Trailer  IGN: Hold my beer. 24 hours later...........
It will be the best game in the world for me
99 details but an honest review ain’t of them😂😂😂
You won’t pin this comment
The GTA six trailer makes me Horne
I’m so hyped for this game. So much time and love has clearly been put into this world and i’m so ready to explore it.
First one!
First
