I'm having a quadruple bypass next week, and seeing you up and about a week after surgery is encouraging. Thank you Rick for this video, it helped put me at ease.
Lucky you. I had Afib & didn't know it until almost a year later when I had severe shortness of breath. I couldn't even play guitar for more than 5 minutes. They then told me I also had mitral valve regurgitation & put me on pills. 4 yrs later it was severe at age 58. They put me on pulminary twice because the surgeon felt it was re-repairable after still reading moderate. I kind of remembered some stuff about waking up & them putting me back to sleep thinking it was the same day. Then I was told we can no longer let you sleep. You've were admitted 9 days ago & had many visitors. I spent 8 days intubated & 8 days extubated & the recovery there sucked. Long story short, the Afib came back 9 mo later & 6 mo later I had Congestive Heart Failure, I had a heart ablation & found out what diretics really do. Without them I gain weight real fast (water weight). I never smoked/drank in my life. Sleep apnea gave me the Afib.
Great video. Your story is very similar to mine. 10 years after my diagnosis I had surgery with Dr. Gillinov. I was 61. As you say he is the best in the world. I was fortunate that I could have mine done robotically. It is amazing how quick the recovery is. Glad you are doing so well.
Follow up. Jan 16 of this year Mitral valve repair OHSU Portland Oregon.  Our cases are similar. Asymptomatic. But surgery recommended.  Full physical recovery in short order. .Sternum splitting is a real thrill and a badge of courage. Congrats on your recovery.
Glad to see you focusing on the importance of maintaining good health. As far as the ideas for the channel, as Lou Reed says, “Do what you want to do.”
Rick seems to have recovered very well so I would have to assume that even when he got back to playing guitar, he made sure not to pick up a Les Paul until quite some time after the surgery!
It's all that rock and roll music, lol....heal well
yes..go Rick!!!  I had OHS too..welcome to the zipper club.
I am a 68 year-old guitar player who performs fairly regularly. I had the exact same surgery, though I didn’t appear before an audience in a week. I did get back up on stage in eight weeks with Richie Furay. Your story is an inspiration to all of us who have gone through major surgery. Love your channel!
I appreciate your input.  I am having a triple bypass on 8-18 .  Very encouraging.
1. You joined the club. We're old. You're still walking! 2. Please Rick, continue to educate, entertain and occasionally astound us.
Happy you're on the mend!
Glad you are well 🎉
Hello from the UK. Health and happiness to you. Love your work.
Glad to see you doing well, God bless you and take good care of your health. Remember, ♫♪Listen to your heart♪♫
God bless Rick,  glad you're feeling good again!  Just had open heart surgery myself for a aortic dissection....  taking  meds and eating alot better,  I feel more vivid and more alive than I have in 20 years!
So you do have a heart and witnesses thereof. 😋
The miracle of modern medicine. Glad everything worked out.
Had to revisit this one since I've been on a Uncle Rick kick here lately. We love you, man. You're more important than you'll ever know!
Sending Prayers be well!!
Rick - you are amazing! I am 75 y/o and had open heart surgery- a valve replaced, and my Aorta repaired. It’s been 6 weeks an you are kicking a*s ! My bass playing touring days are over with Paul Revere and the Raiders but I still write etc. I have some Cardio classes to go through but have to say you are my hero and You amaze me that you are back to looking and sounding great! God bless and keep rocking! ❤
Name Tara Rochester ny…. I get your med stuff.  I suffer too.  Nerolgical JERID FISHER.  On your side.! Appreciate your talents human to human.. I get it
Oh no! Didn't know, but noticed you're not looking same as past. Hope you didn't join experiments which is made this common experience. Sadness, but glad you're still with us to do your epic interviews.
Don’t change a thing! We love you
ROCK ON RICKY B 🎸🙏🎸 so glad you are doing well ☮️ time for you to appreciate your time and family!
So glad you're on the mend. I've been enjoying your videos for about a year or so now. I'm 63 and concerned about my health as I've gotten older. One thing I've adopted is a whole foods, plant based diet. I don't know how you eat and or exercise I'd strongly encourage you to investigate this way of living. There's a great documentary called "Forks Over Knives" that deals with, or explains this way of eating and why everyone should do it. I don't know if you recall when Bill Clinton had his heart attack and following surgery, but after that he adopted this way of eating. There's a book in particular called "Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease" by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. that explains how and is the diet Clinton used in his recovery. So, check it out if you'd like. Best wishes and thank you so much for all the great content. Peace!
Be well, sir.
Guessing that 9 mile walk was to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!
So glad you've survived so far!
You say you have nearly no pain after having your chest cracked open one week prior.  I had CABG X4 in 2022.  My chest still hurts after 2 years, but one week after the surgery was a complete sh*show of pain!!
I went to have surgery last year. I always felt chest pains when I was little up until now. Doctors checked numerous times even with an mri, echo, etc. and they said there was nothing wrong. They said it was due to my meds. Turns out I have a tiny hole in my heart that never closed up. See, some people are born with it, but it usually closes up as you age. But mine never did, also the hole caused part of my heart (I can’t remember which part), one of the tubes I think, to be closed off more. I had to get a stent put in. I’m 25 years old.
Rick, you always had a great heart and now it just keeps the beat even better
Never commented before, but watched you a lot. Happy that you're healthy. Take care Rick.
Heart attack Survivor here I can completely and utterly relate to everything you're saying Happy Thanksgiving and I'm really glad you're okay Rick
I like the interviews. Do more with the artist so they can talk and go in depth. You excel when you ask and let them ramble and talk.
Glad you're ok
So glad all is well. Take it easy nothing heavy except strumming you wonderful guitar😊
Rick, What you have achieved with your channel is to chronicle the intricacies of the music that has shaped all our lives . As a musician I value the incredible insight you have but also as an interviewer your ability to get to the very essence of the person you are talking to is outstanding.
Here's to another 62 years! 🙏
The legacy that you’ve already left behind is a global treasure for generations! You will rock this for another 120years 🥃
Hey Rick, compliments from far off Zimbabwe, I follow your podcasts which I really enjoy, and wish you a speedy recovery. All the best Rick.
Stil can't believe you feel no pain a week after getting your sternum cracked open! As for the channel, when you do "What Makes This Song Great", I wish you'd talk more about the social vibe of the time.  Why was the song written?  Why did fans resonate with it?  That's what I thought was going to be discussed the first time I watched one, and I still think it's the missing ingredient.
great to hear you are better
❤
Rick, nice to see your surgery went well and you certainly present as one who looks and acts really healthy and viable after only one week. I had that same surgery when I was sixty years old and I am seventy seven now. But my story also includes developing atrial fibrillation (AFIB) at age seventy and my ejection fraction dip to under 35% within three years. After a defibrillator implant I then had a rare cancer develop and had to undergo more than a year of chemotherapy followed by a radiation sequence. I am a survivor but my EF is now close to 20%. Chemo, while knocking out the tumor, does significant heart damage. So, if I can offer some unsolicited advice, stay in regular contact with your cardiologist. And if a worst case scenario occurs, the Cleveland Clinic is one of the best there is to confront any developing complications. Like cancer. I am with the Fred Hutch Cancer center in Seattle and, I may be biased, but they are the best in the world.
Glad you’re better !  Continue to be well !
Hope you're well now. Amazing what medicine can do now. I am so grateful for the years I was given by med.
having had 2 near death experiences I have rethought about my direction and plans twice now in what I would consider a more serious than normal sequence. I think its pretty natural to reevaluate your life and direction when you are presented your fragility and mortality so dramatically
I just had double bypass 3 weeks ago. Man, you should have warned us about sneezing, lol.  Glad you are doing well. Love the interviews.
Welcome to the sternum scar club. If, like me, your scar enlarges in the next year or so talk to your dermatologist. A few simple injections helped shrink my scar, an easy 45second procedure.
Glad they took care of you! Happy healing.
Glad you are on the mend Rick.
❤Arohanui brother❤ (big love)
Rick, I like you. I like watching you share anything you are passionate (and educated) about. Keep on truckin’ my man ✌️
I wish you a speedy recovery and all the love in the world. i am almost 64 and also a guitarist (mostly classical) and i have a list of medical problems. so i know enough about it. Hugs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rick, I don't mean to sound like a sap, weirdo,  or a selfish dick (although I am a card carrying member of all three groups), but finding your channel relatively recently has genuinely improved the quality of my life.  You're one of the most talented people I've ever "known", and you are musically and intellectually gifted in a way that can only be the result of a fortuitous fluke of nature. .Frankly, you're the closest thing to a role model I've ever had. In a world that's become a chaotic sea of insanity, the knowledge that people like you still exist (all one of you) is not a luxury but a necessity.  Please take care of yourself, if not for your own sake, then for ours.
So happy you're doing well Rick, cheers from the UK.
So glad your doing well now God bless you
That's great to hear you're doing good now Rick. I'm also 62, with some heart issues and seeing a cardiologist. Must be very common. Maybe I will need surgery one day, but you give me a lift to know what can be done. Love your channel. Love music, especially from 'our' era. Best regards.
Glad you are doing well Rick!
If I didn’t know he was intubated, I’d assume he was just yelling at a concert lol
Oh man...... just keep rockin'.
I pray for excellent health for you.
I hope you return to Cleveland and tour the Rock Hall of Fame would love to hear your guided tour. So glad to hear your surgery went well and a big shout out to those docs who literally kept you alive during surgery, they are the gods in the room😊
Had the same surgery 6 years ago for the same reasons you had. Best thing I've ever done medically. Glad it worked for you as well.
You take care. The planet needs you alive.
Best wishes
Hope all is normal sir.  I have watched your videos off and on (due to my busy life, not because of lack of interesting content) but lately have been more regimented about them. I was blown away by the episode about the music industry and was so impressed with what I believed happen to music in my own assessments.  I am musicians and grew up with the vinyl's, LP, 45 and turntables.   Yes, is was a big deal when we had "new album release parties"--drinking and getting lit up and ultimately throwing on that crips new LP side# 1.  We then listened, critiqued or praised them, and yes, reading the covers and sleeves were part of that tradition.  I watched the transitions from 8 track, to  cassette, to CD.  Basically there is no organic place to hold music except the streaming sources.
Glad you're ok Rick! 🎶🎵
I just discovered your channel and - selfishly - I would be really missing out if you weren't on the mend since I've already missed EIGHT (!!!) years of your videos.   Seriously and sincerely, so happy for you, your family and friends - and your fans/viewers - that you had the surgery, and it was a success. Glad you didn't take the lackadaisical attitude of your doctor at face value. I've known a few people who took their doctor's word literally - without being proactive enough, and it didn't work out too well for them.  Can't send flowers but I just subscribed!
Take Care Rick I had a heart attack and did not notice - it can happen - minor ones It is confronting the Doctors says did you know you have had a heart attack? No Doctor I did not notice it happened while fighting COVID most likely 2 falls. U TAKE CARE
Take care Rick. Loads of love.
Wow Rick I did not know this happened. Wishing you all the best!
Happy to hear you're doing well Rick.
I love the interviews and I miss what makes this song great!
You know now that the most lonely place in the world is your view of the corridor ceiling as they wheel you into the theater and lift you onto the op table. Five hours and a quadruple bypass later, you're so happy when you wake up....I know I was....
Yes indeed that valve is cause me a little bit of issues I'm glad to hear that it was totally successful with you Rick get well heal and keep on down the road man cause love the channel
I usually watch you tube on my cable channel. I don't know if you are aware, but the button to subscribe or join is not available in that mode, I had to go to the Internet to make that work. So glad you are well, enjoy your channel.
Maybe you didn't ask.  But here is another suggested artist to discuss:  Tom Waits.  Peerless songs, arrangements and body of work.
When you get to this stage of life (I'm 67), every day you open your eyes in the morning is a good day! :)
Glad you're recovering well, Rick - bit of an idea for content, since you asked: is there any chance you could do a breakdown of either a film score or film scoring in general? I don't know if people will find it as interesting as breaking down a pop song, but there's probably important crossover learning there...
Glad you are doing well Rick.  Your vidoes are great!
My best wishes for a quick recovery and long-lasting results. You have to stay healthy to continue producing such incredible content!! I have learned SO much. I have loved your breakdown videos and one about technical production. Little by little, I'm learning music theory. Wow, you are just amazing. Keep it up!  Thank you for being such an excellent explainer, it is so easy to listen to and understand.  I apologize for being unable to super chat you, forced retirement on a shoestring!
I am glad the doctors got you all fixed up!  This shows why medical science skeptics are just, well, weird.
So glad you're ok now Rick. Isn't it amazing what surgeons can do now? I know this is an old video but I'm catching up. Lots of love.
Amazing story. Glad you’re doing well. 👍
I'm a very casual viewer who just saw this. I hope you're doing well. I always enjoy your videos and wish you a long life ahead.
I´m Happy that now you´re better !!! We need people like you !!!!
Keep doing the interviews. They are a highlight of your channel.
Glad everything went well, brother. Look forward to many more years of your channel.
Praying your recovery continues to go well.
Cardiac issues are a sign of great musicianship.
Rick...continue to heal; physically,  mentality,  emotionally!!  You're a great teacher, enthusiast, and your vids are greatly appreciated!  God's speed!
I would prioritize interviews over everything else. You have spoken with so many legends, and it seems like we lose more and more of them every year. That said, the song-related content is also top-tier. Glad you’re on the mend!
We love you, Rick...!!  Keep bringing us your amazing content and videos, but please, take care of yourself, first amd foremost...!!
Prayers for a speedy recovery!
Congratulations on your successful surgery sir. Get better and keep doing what you do which is give honest opinions concerning the music of today as well as the good ole days and tell great stories of your experiences in the music industry
Glad to hear everything went well!  Been watching you for years and love your videos!
I was at University Hospital just down the road from Cleveland Clinic and had mitral valve surgery 4 years ago this month. This was at the height of covid so no visits and limited nursing. I do maintenance for a police/jail and pretty physical. First 2 years after I went a mile a minute. Year 3 slower but still good pace. Last year mostly ok but needed more breaks. Last work day was this last Thursday. Retired! Glad you are feeling better. I know how rough a road it was.
I am glad your still hear to educate us.
Rick,  I also am having some heart issues requiring surgery.  I’m glad to hear your procedure went well.  As for your channel, I am a fan of some of what you do and not other aspects.  I think your interviews are up there with the best.  As a fan and fellow guitarist you show the same enthusiasm and ask the questions we would like to ask given the opportunity.  You also let the artists talk, without talking over them, we all benefit from these outstanding interviews.  I know content developers are always trying to figure out ways to profit form their work, and that is fair, but I am more about musicians having a forum to share and learn minus the profit mentality. What I like least about your channel is when you imply your opinions are more than just that your opinions.  We all have them, and sharing them is wonderful, however often you come out a little strong, as in your right, even though it’s just your opinion.  That said I think much of what you do is top notch and wish you the best in your recovery and for the future of your channel.
Good to hear that everything went well for you you do a great service with your videos for all of us music fans and guitar so-called players Cheers.
Love you, Rick!
Glad you had that surgery-good to get that out of the way with hopefully many more years of music-making, teaching and being with your family. My friend's brother passed away at 32 years old from a prolapsed mitral valve. It was profoundly sad and shocked us all. Young musician that had so much to live for...my friend gave me his Beatles vinyls and a Sgt. Pepper's poster.
Wherever you want to go with your channel, Rick, know that we’re going to follow you and love it as much as everything that has gone before. We’re on this journey with you.
I had a heart Ablation last October it crazy it like nothing ever happen Glad your OK.
God bless you know.
Wow.  I missed this! You look amazing for 1 week after open heart surgery!
Get well soon!
Glad you are ok thought about theory and prayer daily Father please watch over Rick and help him heal…Work us an Amazing progression up Mr Beato…….something gospel if even Holdsworth style……..how would holdsworth approach whiter shade of pale…..with above and below type chords to build and build...
I had the same thing in 2020 - but exacerbated by a bacterial blood infection  that had left me emaciated and 'insane'. 5 weeks in the hospital, out thank God just before Covid hit, but had a mitral valve and an aortic valve replaced. BIg scar, it's incredible to think of them cracking you open like cleaning a crab, but here I am today, and I did feel 1000% better after my recuperation from the trauma, which is what it is, of open heart surgery. God Bless you, Rick, love your channel and everything you do, been playing guitar for over 50 years but only bloomed when I found your channel and the Beato Book. Theory is now coming to me, and I start to understand what I've been doing by ear and feel all these years. Thank you, Brother!
So happy you're healing well. I've had 4 open heart surgeries and my last one was at the Cleveland Clinic. Greatest doctors, nurses, and staff in the world. We're so lucky... sending you all the best. eo, robby
I'm so glad for you!
Wow this is the first I'm hearing about this, I'm glad you're fixed up, well just don't go moving that wall of amplifiers in the background. I'd like to see you do some videos about Rik Emmett, Kim Mitchell, and more Rush, but i like all your videos, take it easy. I'm 64 and having some heart problems as well, scary !
Glad you’re doing well! Take care.
Glad to hear you are well and on the mend , your youtube clips are a Godsend❤
Really happy you're fine, Rick, we need you at full capacity! 😄
Glad to hear that you are well! For a song breakdown I would really like to understand more about Simply Red - Fairground !
Rick, having had too many surgeries (nearly all orthopedic), isn't waking up f/anesth and in the recovery room, and realizing that you are in the recovery room, and not in heaven, isn't that just the greatest feeling? Otra vez, strong recovery, brother.
"normally, I'm really energetic..." Rick, you think. Or, is that not the understatement of the year? Hang in there. We all love you.
Rick, so glad you'll be healthy and energetic for many more years. I loved the Keith Urban interview! Keep up the great work, buddy.
Wow!, Rick, Glad to hear ypu doing well. Scary stuff, Be well, Nicky - Rochester NY Far Past Dark

Great to see you healthy, up and about. Take care and keep at it. Love your channel 🙏🙏🙏
Glad you're on the mend Rick.  A few health scares along the way for many of us, try to put it behind you and look forward to tomorrow.
Doc, it hurts when I do this.  Doc says, "Don't do that".  Get well, love your teaching and videos. All the best.
Glad to have you Back !! You are the Music King of making sense of what we listen to in Songs
Love you Rick. Thank you for your beautiful videos over the years. You bring so much joy to our lives. Best wishes.
I’m glad you got this taken care of   We need you around brother for a long time to come.

Glad you are OK.  Getting older is scary.

How about an interview with Joe Perry and some of his early work?
Glad you're feeling better!
good going there Rick. Delighted at your post prognosis 👍👍
God bless and so glad you’re doing well, Rick.  Modern medicine is amazing!
Thank God for skilled surgeons.
So glad you're ok. Wishing you a full recovery.

G,eat news! I'm 10 years after aortic valve and aorta replacement. Love what you do and niceto here a "valve job" will keep you going.
I enjoy your videos, glad you'll be around for another 20 years, hopefully longer. Stay healthy and keep pickin.
May we all live a life so meaningful that it is worthy of well wishes too numerous to read them all. Let me add one to that long and well deserved list.
Good to hear you're doing well 👍🏾
Gardian angel is watching you Rick. Incredible recovery.
This is such great news Rick! Wow how amazing only a week later and it only hurts some if you cough, that is fantastic! So glad it all went well and you are obviously recovering awesomely! We appreciate all you do Rick, you are entertaining as well as educating, God Bless you, keep on ticking! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😃

Hope you get better soon. Just pick up a double neck Gibson SG
I started watching your channel for the song breakdowns, which I still really enjoy, but the interviews have been excellent!
Nothing over 10 lbs.  So much for Les Pauls, eh?  🤗 I'm so glad to see you're doing well, Rick. Carry on!
Wonderful that you are well.
The Pfizer company took care of many hearts and took good care of turning them off

Glad to see your feeling better,love your channel.

Stay well, Rick!
Rick, I had Mitral Prolapse and my Surgeon, Patrick McCarthy of Northwestern Hospital was the best too! I had my surgery at the age of 50 and I just turned 66! My scar is hardly noticeable now, and I came through with flying colors!
Don't die on us Rick!   .
I'm glad you are feeling better bro! 🎸🎵🎵🎵
Had mine done in January. Doing fine. Congrats(and love the channel!)
Rick, You are a blessing to the musician community and to me. You have inspired me to pursue Music Man!  That's you! Live, love, life!
Force à vous!🙌🙌🙌
I'm happy for you
Take care of yourself Rick.
💪🏻God Bless you, Mr. Beato 🙏🏼💜
Rick as a fellow musician and stroke survivor I made my way back after a difficult time after my medical problems.  Glad you’re doing well!  I just put a brand new tune on my channel to celebrate my recovery!😊
Hey Rick! Glad to know everything went well! Moving forward, what if you start a “classic albums” kind of series? Wish you all the best!
God bless
So happy you are doing well!
62? Well..., you're super young and still have many miles to go, Rick! God bless you.
Thank you for all you do and I'm sure glad you're healthy.
Great to hear about your successful surgery.  Keep up the great work!!!
Rick, glad to hear your surgery was a success. You are really an inspiration for so many of us. Please continue the great work!
Wow that’s scary wish you a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹
Rick it's Rick Foster here telling I'm so glad it went off without a hitch and your already getting back to normal. Stay well my friend 💪🏻🙏🏻👍🏻
Hey Rick!  You look great.  I had a similar surgery in Jan 2022.  I had a few more vales repaired/replaced and other procedures to address an other heart issues caused by HCM.  It is amazing that the recovery after that major of a surgery. I can totally relate to being exhausted mid day because the heart is not pumping at full capacity before the surgery and how much better you feel after.  .  Glad you got it done while you are still young enough to enjoy.  Stay healthy and keep those videos coming.  I love them - especially the interviews!
All the best!
My cardiologist says I will have to have that sometime too. Who knows when. I’m in Philly so we have good surgery available. You can’t lift a Les Paul yet 😎. I am also 62.
Happy to see your up and running Rick , I give you all the credit for bringing music back into my life again and not only that I appreciate just how wonderful it was to be born in the time period I was (1953) when in my opinion some of the greatest bands and musicians of all time were born and were at their best as well. Thank you Rick !  Glad you’re still with us my friend 🙏
Hope you re ok, stay healthy!
Glad you're okay
Glad you are okay.
Great news!
Glad to hear that you're doing well after a scary surgery.  All the best!
Rick, glad you are doing great! My Mother had emergency valve replacement surgery a few months ago and she is now better than ever! Keep up your sense of humor, as humor is an invaluable asset in life. - CHEERS!
Healthy recovery &  wishes from Socal
Personally , i have had the early afternoon fatigue, (nap helps) since the 2020 first covid shot.  No boosters since the first shot. I have No discernible heart issues thankfully.  Thrilled you made a good recovery! Love your work. I learn a ton.
We will never meet.  I don't know you, you don't know me but, I follow your channel, learn and feel a connection as fellow musicians and I thank you.  Fast recovery,  God doesn't need you yet, we do.  All the best Rick.
Glad you had the surgery and back at it. You are important to the music industry and I am  fan. Go forth and do your thing........
wow, Rick!  I did not know of this until now (8/12/24).  Great to know you're already over it and recovering well.....
GLAD IT WENT WELL STAY WELL RICK GREAT SHOW
🥳
Rick, thank you for this video. I had open heart surgery when I was one to repair a valve that was not working properly and told I would probably need another surgery in my 30s. I am now 41 and have been hearing the same as you had that I need to have surgery 3-4 years and keeps pushing back. I have a leaky valve and they are waiting to see when I need that fixed. To be honest I am super scared about it, but hearing your story does relieve some of the anxieties I have about it. Thank you again for the story and glad to hear that you are doing well!
❤‍🩹
Glad you're ok. Great channel.
You can play a guitar...just not a Les Paul. ;-) Glad you're doing well. Love the channel and your teaching!!!
Glad you’re recovering 👍
Avoid any future problems. Curing with Cayenne, look it up.
Pomposity got you
Wishing you the best Rick.  We need you in this world!
Glad that you're doing well--your talents and personality are well-loved by so many.
Rick. I've followed and loved your content for years. Glad to hear you're on the mend and doing well. The world would be a lesser place without your knowledge, wit and creativity. Jack Wilson in Idaho.
So happy you're on the mend. Thank you for sharing - love your videos!
Glad to hear of your successful  surgery. I may need the same. Your work on this channel is really appreciated!!!
Rick, I’m glad you are ok!  Love all your videos, certainly your song breakdowns, but moreso… your interviews of great musicians.  So much to learn from those people!  Keep it going!
Rick, I wish you a speedy recovery and thank you for the influence and lessons you've given to all musicians. You are a wonderful person.
I missed your post about your surgery!!!! I'm praying for your healing, curing, and recovery. Do whatever causes you the least amount of stress.
Will pray for you Rick. If God gives you breath, you have purpose!   Have you ever done anything on Phil Keaggy.  How about the Glass Harp Band He was in?  There is a guitar solo in there by Phil, that is incredible. The song is called "Never is a Long Time"
Bless you Rick!
Teddy Rumble, before a person asks a sarcastic question about passing a certain subject, they should learn how to spell. In case you don't know, "fid" is not a word. And a heart bypass is nothing to joke about on this video. Learn some manners.
So glad to hear all is well.
Glad you are doing well Rick, keep up the good work!
Great to hear, Rick. Don't you dare think of going anywhere. ;)
I think you work too hard and need to take more relax time so you don't burn out from overwork.  Walk more.
Good luck with the speedy recovery!
Good to hear you're feeling better cheers mate
quick recovery Rick A+++
Glad your doin good now Rick. Im 52 and have been a professional mysician for the last 25 years. Love your channel my friend. Your Complete recovery and healing are in my preyers🙏🎸
I have a similar diagnosis, but wow, stopping the heart?  That's a very big deal.
So glad to hear you are on the mend and doing well!  Take it easy and wish you well!!
Glad to hear your surgery was a huge success !!
I will likely need this procedure if I am lucky. Wondering what made you choose Cleveland Clinic over other heart surgery centers.
Hard to know what to say. Good to know you are well and back in your studio
Hey Rick, I wish you a speedy recovery! I am a patient at Cleveland Clinic too; they have some wonderful doctors! My issues deal more with my back problems from being a roadie for several years in the 80s and from working in the music instrument retail industry for many years lifting heavy equipment and such. I love it when you analyze the various styles of music and explain why some things work and others don't. I also enjoy the interviews as well. Keep doing the good work and we will continue to keep watching!
I do like the intereviews, I just watched the Alan Parsons one, Great job. More of the song breakdowns would be nice. Are you still doing live videos?
Glad you 're doing well Rick, you look like you've lost about 15 pounds as well??  God Bless.
Dear Rick. This is the most important post you’ve ever made. I’m so glad you´re well. Best wishes for speedy recovery.
Keep well and continue with your great and very interesting work.
I've had open heart surgery 9 years ago. Changed my life !  May you have a long and healthy life, and may you enjoy every minute of it :-)
Late to the feed... CONGRATS!  It's amazing how far tech has grown so that even open-heart surgery is like "a week" and you're out.  I love the interviews - you bring a unique take on the music industry having known all of these artists and producers for a long time.  I wonder if you could mix an interview with a breakdown??  Having one of "the greats" go through a song together and discuss the music theory behind it - not even one of their songs, but something that is streaming today.  Just an idea - it's great that you're feeling better!!  Keep making awesome vids!
❤
I’m glad you’re better. I love the interviews with these musicians and listen to how they play. The Lai play the things they go through. It’s very very interesting.
Sir, you are deeply appreciated by many ... it's uncountable, actually. It's just Love & Respect. Accept it. Take it in.  Peace. Light. Blessings. Joy. & Health.
Glade your better. Take it easy for the next 6 months. Enjoy life!
I still may need this in 8-10 years. I was cabbaged last year, and they chose not to insert that valve at this time.  Mr. Beato is good to go…
So glad you are on the mend, Rick! We need you around for many years to come! All the best on your recovery.
Oh no Ric, did you get the jab?
Selenium coq10 efa dha , cycle ivermectin 2 times a year regardless or clo2   Protocol for parasite and glyphosate removal oh and i love your shows
Thank God your okay my dad had triple heart by pass he bit emotional after for few weeks❤
Wow, you look great and glad you’re recovering.  A true blessing.
So happy your ok Rick! I have Wolfe Parkinson white syndrome so at some point I will probably need some attention as well. Im a 52 year old guy and I am not looking forward to surgery but your storie makes me feel more at easy. Love your channel! God Bless!
We love you
I'm glad you're ok !!
I just finished reading Ray Kurzweil's "The Singularity is Nearer" about AI passing the Turing test in 2029 where he predicts (all of his predictions have been true) that life expectancy will exponentially rise to an average of 120. So since you'll still be young in 2029, here's to another 62 years! I've been steeped in Classical and academic music for such a long time, but my inner joy (not a guilty pleasure) is rock and jazz. I discovered you recently and grateful how you walk through the soundtrack my my life with such passion. I'm turning 60 in exactly a week. So happy you are here.
You're looking and moving GOOD, Rick.  Hope you live a long and happy life.
Get Well Soon Rick !  ( from Cape Town , South Africa )🙏🌸🐚🍃
Glad you’re ok!!  ❤❤
Rick, may God help you heal, keep you healthy and in a great shape in the best of ways!
God bless you, Rick. What a time to live with all that can be done to extend and improve our lives. Thank you Father in Heaven!
Glad you're on the mend. We still need to hear/watch your video's
Amazing! Glad to hear you are doing so well!
Kinda of late to the party, but I'm glad you're well, and that in this day and time it was "such an easy" thing to fix! It is amazing!  On the off chance you do read this, I hope you do more on Kate Bush! And I really like the What makes this song great videos you make :)
Get well!!!
glad that you are ok
Glad you had your valves replaced, and at a reputable shop.  Seriously, glad you are doing well.
please interview macca or townsend. Only you know what relative questions to ask.
Glad your surgery went well. At the tail end of your message, you remarked that you were interested in input for your channel into the future.  I'm very close to your age but do not follow any new musicians and believe the industry continues to decline.  May I offer hope for the future?  Please check out the duo Larkin Poe, they are really talented and refreshing.
Thank you for what you do, Rick. I so appreciate your talents, and insight. I am so happy you are doing well. Get rested and keep pressing on! Blessings!
take care Mr Beato and keep doing what you do, be good stay safe 🙏
Prioritize your health! No worries, we're here and you're good!
So glad you’re doing well ! Love your channel / love to hear you play ❤️ Thank you!!
Some suggestions came to mind. It amazes me how many Nirvana, Thin Lizzy and Sabath T-shirts I see around and some of them even know the music although occasionally the art work is great also! Shocked how much music was recycled by the teens but equally how they are now listening to it half of much (your recent video) How a bout a What makes this song great for 'Black Rose' by Thin Lizzy, or a top twenty non-orchestral instrumentals - such as Jean Michelle-Jarre Oxygene/Equinox, Kraftwerk Autobahn, Popcorn lol. Or Top Twenty novelty hits...... usually one hit wonders as well such as 'Monster Mash' by the crypt kicker 5 lol. Or John Miles 'Music' which is awe inspiring for us all who have lived our lives by music and sound. Music was my first love and it will be my last.....
Wow, didnt realise you had a leak, but great that it has been fixed and a week later you are doing a video amazing! Keep getting better, wonders of modern medicine, wish I could say the same about modern music! T
Love your channel.  Sorry if I am behind.  Your energy is amazing.
Sooo glad you had the procedure. The CC is top notch as well as University Hospitals here too. How fortunate we are to have them. Glad you're better. Get well soon  😊
Wishing you a full recovery - so much more music for you to review.
🙏 get well soon!
Nothing over 10 pounds? So no Les Paul's?  LOL!!!! Get well soon!  🙂
Matt Jones creator ifJonesin' Crosswords celebrated your recovery in today's crossword. The clue was: Rock and jazz YouTuber Beato. Any guesses?
What a come back Rick!  Stay well and keep rocking.
I'm glad your surgery was successful, glad you're healing up and feeling better, Rick! As for the direction you are taking the channel, I want to say how much I love the interviews you do. It is clear how much musicians appreciate getting to talk about music instead of hype. Your questions start fires. What you ignite makes for unique footage. I can imagine that, by now, almost any singer, player, writer, performer would love to go on camera with you - that your reputation as a stellar interviewer precedes you. And, Rick, you keep interviewing people I love to hear from directly. I'm rooting for Brian Setzer to sit down with you. Maurice White. Paul Weller. Pat Benatar. Smoky Robinson. Jeff Lynne. Carole King. Boz Scaggs. Earl Klugh. Bruce Cockburn. Roland Orzabal. Paddy McAloon. The Edge.
Happy to see you're doing well - there are many people who actually get scared of their health situations so hearing stories like yours should put people a little more at ease. Keep up the great work you do with your videos!
These are the times people don't have a problem "playing God"
so glad you are ok. you should have asked for prayers..... would consider it an honor to pray for you bud.
So glad you’re still with us Rick!!!  Don’t go anywhere.
Really glad to hear and it sounds like things have progressed very well. Super excited that you're back and things are on the mend
Get well buddy…
Speedy recovery!!!
Feel better, Rick.
I’ve been a fan since the early days of “what makes this song great”,   Three years ago I had a heart attack, and I wasn’t going to spend the money for an ambulance, so I told my wife, a nurse, that I’d go to the Dr tomorrow. I did, the next morning I went to my Dr, did tests, and went back to work. An hour later my doctor called and told me to get my ass to the ER.
Hey Rick, very glad to hear you are recovering so well after your surgery! Great news all the best to you and your family.
Happy things are going well and that you paid attention to what your body was telling you! Here’s to many more years and amazing videos.
Read Dr Steve Gundry - The Plant Paradox
I’m glad you’re better!
i'm 70 ....get well brother.
Glad it went well for you Rick!
wishing you the best Rick.
I appreciate you Rick, and love your videos. Glad you're well.
Hey dude, I’m sun it’s not a barrel of laughing but you are doing awesome on the recovery and sound very upbeat
Rick,ti auguro tutto il bene di questo mondo.Sei una bellissima persona,ed il mondo, nel tuo piccolo,ha bisogno di persone come te.Non mollare mai 👋🏻
All the best for you all here,Health , love and good music. Thank you I love this channel and your work
To me, the interviews are where it's at. You are preserving rock history. Vitally important before our generation is gone, and ESPECIALLY because people seem to have forgotten how to make real music. You are doing something really important as well as so entertaining 😊
Good for you Rick. I've had two stents and two pacers over 14 years and I'll be 70 come Sept. I take care of myself, always have but family history is my issue. You look great and you would never know, just looking at you. Stay strong.✌
Thankful for you & all that is still yet to come!
Your videos are awesome and to tell this story was fantastic.  Congrats for the speedy recovery!
Love you brother….  So glad you’re on the mend! ✌️❤️🙋🏻‍♂️🎸
Ponerte bien pronto!
Hang in there brother.  We are at an age where stuff comes out of nowhere.  I'm blessed to have had a driver and a good intervention is nearby  when  I needed them. Keep  up the good work.  Please take a look at Tommy Johannson and God gave rock and rolll to you Amazing guy
You’re a gift from God Rick.  Glad to hear you’re on the mend.  You have no idea how many thousands of people you help cope with life’s daily struggles with your immaculate interviews and amazing song break downs.   Here’s to 40 more great years !!!!
So glad it went well!
I did that at 59, welcome to the zipper club
Love and respect Mr. Beato. May full health and wellness be on you again soon. God bless agus sláinte a chara. ❤
Wow... so glad you are doing well and recovered! I got it for my birthday ;) ... in  April the day I turned 62 yr old (emergency room) drivin 800 miles from home in CT.  Luckily, I pulled off and luckily ended up at a hospital I'd been to in my 20's.  You can imagine the jokes as the Dr's and nurses, kept asking me my birth date.  Anyway, like you that afternoon drop is noticable. So glad you're well. Keep up the great work across all your channels.
Glad to hear and see that you are recovering well post op, Rick. Looking forward to whatever you decide to do next. I must admit, I like the mix of materials that you post.
Glad to hear your on the mend my friend! x
I'm glad you are doing well. I love music and I love your videos!! Keep up the great work. I'm from Jax, FL, my dad had open heart surgery in the 80's. The same time he was in CCU, Gary Rossington was in there... at least I think it was Gary. 😜 Definitely a member of LS, and I remember Gary had heart problems. 1+1=2 😊
glad to see you back...and that all went well !!
Get well soon sir!🙏🙏
BROTHER...YAY!!!!! I am here in Cleveland, saw your post and am so glad you did it here, WORLD'S BEST, and now you heal!!!! So happy for you, truly NOW.... HEAL!!!!!!
Glad you're on the mend, Rick! You are loved online by us but your health and your family are more important than we are.
R I C K   WELCOME   B A C K ! ✌️❤️👍
All my best wishes for a full and prompt recovery, and stop scaring all of us followers with health issues, you must stay healthy as we need you full steam on YouTube, Rick!!
Wow. Glad to hear you are doing ok. Been listening to you for awhile now.
Had exactly to same operation as you Rick mid April at the age of 75. Your recovery looks way ahead of the norm. Keep up the good work. I'm not a musician but music lover and you have given me a great insight in to the industry.
As a techno-optimist, this was great to, see, hear and read.
I'm happy for you and your heart. You rock, Rick!
Glad you are healthy and mending, RB!! 🙏🙏🙏
Eres un gran ser humano y tienes una gran misión enseñándonos a apreciar la música como debe ser... espero pronto estés al 100%, saludos desde México.
Hey Glad you are feeling better and your treatment was successful. Really enjoy your videos and interviews.  Keep up the great work God bless and hope you continue with more interviews and all your other content. I personally would enjoy seeing some more music theory video shorts too.
Just seeing this. Glad to see youve come through this with flying colours Keep On Keepin' On
The first few sconds remind me of a Terry Bruge-Hiplo introduction. Glad your heart is ok now.
God bless you brother, glad you are doing well 🙏
Glad you’re doing well and are healthy, love your channel!
GOD bless you! Happy to hear it all went smooth and you have a great doctor looking after you. I'm so happy that you are happy, we're all glad that you're with us in great shape. Rock on, you earned it!
Glad you are doing well Rick, my mom had the same surgery when she was 90 years old, and came through with no problems.
So glad your surgery went well & you're feeling good.  😊☮️
Having your heart stopped is crazy to think about. Glad you are doing well so quickly.
Get well soon Rick
Thank God you are ok!
Good health Rick!!
Prayers Rick!
Health is above all else. Love your videos, but at your pace!! Don't rush, don't push. Hopefully watching for many years to come.
Prenez soin de vous.
So glad you’re doing better!!❤
Glad you are doing well!
Hey Rick, I’ve had two sternotomies for separate severe mitral valve regurgitations. I’m so glad you’re doing OK. You look amazing having gone through this so recently. God bless you. I love your channel and what you do. Keep up the great work!
Good call Rick! Stay well.
You seem to have recovered quickly!  I had the same operation but for my aortic valve.  It took 6 weeks for the pain in my arms and back to go away.  The valve was replaced with one made from cow.  My brother now calls me Captain Beefheart.  I can live with that.
take care Rick, thank God you're fine.
Love the show, Rick! Glad you are doing well!
glad you are doing good boss!
Welcome to the Family my heart valve brother.went to that same procedure.
Rick, so glad your surgery was successful and you’re feeling well. Keep doing the wonderful interviews!
..you are awesome 🍀 🍄 🌻 ❤
Glad you’re ok Rick.
Stay well Rick! We love you!!
May His High Holiness further Bless and Keep you! Keep doing what you do, presenting great work, and bringing remarkable content and history that needs retained.
🙏🙏🙏
We are very happy that all went well. Take care, maestro: we need you more than you know.
Get well soon you have brought me hours entertainment and education
Rick so glad you’re doing so well. I had the same thing done 8 yrs ago, but mine was robotic. Life time musician I was told the same thing for yrs. Finally I had to it repaired. 2 days after surgery I was up and walking and of course playing my guitar. Can’t wait for you to talk about some Norman Whitfield legacy.
I had the exact same operation, DaVinci robotic when it was still the new thing in 2008, I was 52. Houston Methodist. It was not exactly fun, but I was out surf fishing in 16 days. Still going 16 years later. To be accurate, they tell me now that two things make Afib a little more likely later on: running a whole lot when you're young (NOW they tell me!), and open heart surgery. So I could be back on the table for an "ablation" procedure, but so much better than the alternative for me, which they say would have been lights out by my mid-50's!
I'm glad you're doing well Rick. I've been enjoying your videos for a few years. I had a similar surgery replacing my mitral valve with a mechanical valve a couple of months ago. The recovery was painful but manageable. Now my sternum is healed and I walk 7 miles a day for my rehabilitation. I hope you recovery goes as well as mine!
God bless. May you have many more productive years. Really really enjoy your work.
Thankful you are on the mend!
Praise God you’re doing well !
God Bless you Rick!
Your videos and teaching are the very best- I'm so glad your surgery was successful and you're on the mend!   Thank you for all you do to inspire all of us.
Good luck Rick be well
Rick, glad you are doing better thank God for skilled surgeons. My cousin who is around 59 had a valve replaced, he felt fine but his cardiologist heard a swooshing sound, leaky valve. He chose a horse valve. He is also feeling much better. Italian too
Hi Rick. very glad that you have improved. In my family we have several people who deal with heart issues. God Bless you and be with you.
Glad your procedure went well. Thanks for sharing—giving a glimpse of your privacy. ❤
Cleveland Rocks,...and we have the Cleveland Clinic. Glad your doing well : )
Thank God and Surgeons for you to still be with us !!! Live well, sir. Much Love and Respect !!!
So pleased to hear you are doing well Rick, if anyone deserves it you do. As far as I am concerned you are without doubt the best at what you are doing, one of if not the best musical orators in the world. You don't just talk you teach and that is so important in todays music culture, if one can even call it culture. You make a difference my friend and long may you reign!
So glad you're back and healthy, Rick!
Take this very seriously regardless of all else. Just keep on top of it. If you ever see gray area under your eyes. I’m not saying anything definitively, just saying always be aware of anything that appears or feels abnormal for you. Glad it went well, and  I imagine you’ll be around for another thirty years …
❤‍🩹
Wishing you the best.  We want you To be healthy and happy. That’s how you also make us  happy with your huge talent!! Kisses from São Paulo, Brazil ❤❤
Hey Rick..Glad you are on the mend..My daughter had open heart surgery at 17yo..Was told she possibly wouldn’t last beyond the age of 30 if surgery didn’t happen..We celebrated her 34th birthday just last month.I am constantly in awe and eternally grateful to her wonderful surgeons and the medical professionals in general. Keep doing what you’re doing Rick..I love your musical insights and the way you explain things.Thank you and keep well.
Love you Rick! ❤
fight the good fight Rick!  Glad ur on the mend -keep on keepin' on!
Will be praying for God’s healing touch and your swift recovery!
Are you guys paying attention to reality. The US sailing to it's demise in the middle east and the threats from Iran.  Living in this false reality and missing the important events happening around the world.   What is going on behind the scenes and who is pulling the strings?   All I can tell you is that Damascus will be nuked, Iran (Elam) will be nuked.   The there's this giant war that is at the doorstep of Israel!!!  Iran(Persia), Turkey (Meschech and Tubal), Russia(Magog and Rosh), Baltic States mainly Azerbaijan (Gomer), Libya, Ethiopia and Sudan will attack Israel and their armies will be destroyed by an act of God. Read Isaiah 17, Ezekiel 38 and 39, Psalm 83; these wars are about to take place and the destruction from the book of Jeremiah of Southern Iran. The Muslim nations are about to find out who the God of Israel is. 2600-2700 year old prophecies will soon come true!   Then the tribulation and Great Tribulation will begin. You are living on borrowed time in the world the Lord created and will soon judge and Jesus Christ is coming back for his church. Don't miss the flight, its going to get hot here, just read revelation,: famine, war, all the fresh water gone, grass and trees burn up, 100 lb hailstones, rampant disease, torture, open wounds and sores, heat waves like the world has never experienced that will scorch you, did I mention war yet??   Might want to screenshot this! I don't think the Christians will be here to vote...
Rick, we don't know each other but my name is Philip Marriott and I live in Hamburg.  I have become a devoted follower of your channel. I naturally wish you complete healing and perfect health for the next 30 something years...  and great happiness and enlightenment!..... I hope you do a feature on Paddy McAloon of "Prefab Sprout" fame, who is arguably the greatest UK songwriter and the 'Steely Dan' of England. Best wishes, Phil
love you man...glad you made it out the other side-s
Be well, Rick!   All the best,
Rick glad to hear everything went smoothly and you’re up and running 👍🏼. On a side note, awhile back you figured ten best drum beats. Have you ever heard The Wonton song by Led Zeppelin? I highly recommend that you add that puppy to an all time drum beat. I had to start off playing it slow but eventually got up to speed. Also the added snare and extra bass drum beats that John Bonham throws in are incredibly. Please take a list and let me know what you think.   Bob The Drummer
Go in healthy, come out healthy.
Thank you for your thoughtful and insightful videos. I wish you many good and healthy years ahead.
It's called getting old Rick  I had it worse. I had CABG X5 I had full blown CHF. I was only 49 and just had and passed a physical. That was in 2005. Here it is 2024 and still here. I wash my hospital stay was as short as yours but it wasn't. Happy recovery.
Wishing you the best Rick! Love your videos!
Rick - SO glad your surgury was successful and you're on the mend.    You are a national \ international treasure to the music world.   As a fellow 66 yr old New Yorker who also loves music, I just ask that you kKeep on keeping on, brother!!
I am so thankful that your surgery went  well.And I thank God for the many uplifting videos you've shared with us. To learn from someone who is tremendously talented is a real blessing.   Sincerely Dave  S.
Rick    been there, done~ that 7 years ago.   Best 7 years of my long life...   Congrats my friend and just keep doing whatever it is you Love!
Great to hear that you’re feeling well 😮👍!
Glad to hear you’re on the mend!
life is short ... enjoy it while you are here ...
Welcome to to zipper club Rick! I had my aortic valve done about six months ago and I've never felt better. I'm sure you will too! All the best for a quick recovery!
Your a legend Rick 🎉
Your channel is the best on youtube man. Glad your feeling better
I’m so glad you’re ok. ❤
Goodvto hear all went well man. Get Better still.
Rick if there was ever a man who deserved Good Fortune and Good Karma, it's YOU, brother... I wish you the best of health... God bless... And Eat Your Spinach, broccoli, and fish, and stay away from burgers and the like!
🙏❤️🙏❤️Rick, I’ve been listening to you for awhile. I enjoy the interviews! BTW—I really enjoy your interviews with Steve Lukather! Amazing guy and the original band! And, I listened to your Vinnie Caliutay (screwed his last name up!! I didn’t know of him till recently. He grew up 15 minutes away from me and pretty sure he had to go to school with cousins of mine. Vinnie’s a couple years older than me. The story about him getting kicked out of a polka band is all true!! The band was from the Uniontown, PA area, and I believe the band was called The Dominoes. Prayers for your speedy recovery!
Good thoughts your way, Rick . Glad to hear you are doing well, and it sounds like you had terrific care 🎸
Hello Rick! I am so glad you are on the mend. I pray for your continued recovery and improvement. Thank you for taking the time to do these wonderful videos. Such a wealth of information and you do them with such professionalism. I truly appreciate your work and will keep you in prayer. And thank you for all of the Rush content. I've been drumming to Neil's work since 1979....  All the best!!
I'll add my voice to the chorus of your fans wishing you great health going forward!
glad you are feeling good, had my surgery at age 70 quintuple bypass neat scar right? now 75 and feeling great. Love the channel
Did you have any heart palpitations Rick?
I am so happy it all went well and you are on the mend. Thank you for sharing the update!
Happy your surgery went well. Have a speedy recovery, Rick. God Bless.
im so glad your well. Your 62, im 63 and i was diagnosed with Congestive Heart failure, 4 yrs ago. With a plethora of meds i feel confident ill be able to continue absorbing all the wonderful knowledge and the plain ole entertainment you provide.....I wanted to say  Rock till you drop, but that seems inappropriate so ill end with Thank you
I really appreciate your videos, Rick. Thank you for sure! Keep it up as far as I can see!
Glad to hear you are fighting fit! God bless you Rick.
Way to go Rick. I’m fighting early cancer diagnosis in a similar way. Hoping for the
Rick feel better. God bless, stay healthy and keep strumming. 🙏
Best wishes Rick. If your going to have a heart procedure there is no better place in the world than the Cleveland Clinic. Mitral valve huh? I have had a prolapse mitral diagnosed 40 years ago.  Keep up the great channel.
Glad to great you’re doing well, Rick! Love the channel. ❤
Best wishes to you Rick 🙏
God bless!!
So glad everything went well, I hope you're back to 110% asap. And THANK YOU for your excellent work. ❤
Glad everything went well, Rick. I just had my third open heart surgery last year. Seems like recovery is going smooth. Keep up the great work.
Risk feel better…wishing you well.
Get well soon Rick.u tubers need you
I'm very glad you are recovering and are so positive about the long term outlook. You look great! My prayers are with you, Rick.
Looking good, Rick
God Bless you Rick and all musicians.
I just hope Rick had the chance finally to visit Vienna in the last years. If not: Let’s hope he will still do one time
I am so glad that the Cleveland Clinic helped you, kiddo. You young guys crack me up. I am 65 years old and Cleveland Clinic just helped me with 2 surgeries, chemo and radiation for my cancer. We ask ourselves: what's next? I dunno, Rick. I am just now beginning to try to get back into my daily groove and I have no flippin' idea what is next for me. Do I get back into writing music? Do I keep playing bass at church? Heaven yeah!!! But what else? I'm praying about it and I am certain that God will show me what He wants me to do. Maybe I'll pull my Chapman Stick outta the closet and start practicing again. I sure want to fire up my Harley and I can probably ride that without pain now. But for you Rick, do what you feel. If I decide what you  "should" do for your channel then I will be missing out because you have an amazing life and I am certain that you still have a LOT to share that is worthwhile. Be blessed, buddy!
So glad my fave music teacher is on the mend.  “What Makes This Song Great” has always been your forte.  When you’re feeling up to it, please give us a breakdown of something from the grunge era.  Get well soon, Wilson
I love your 'What Makes This Song Great?' series
🙏
Quick recovery is greatly assisted by overall good health, normal BMI, healthy diet, regular exercise and a positive attitude.   You clearly have all of these going for you. Well done Mr B 👍
So happy you are doing well! All the best !
Eh bud, I had a heart attack 3 years ago. I had no symptoms but like you said, I did get tired easily. I just wanted to say hello, wish the best of health and please keep up the excellent work. Who needs TV when you have videos like yours. :)
You can play the guitar, just no les pauls!! SG only!! Dont over-do it!!
Prayers
God bless you Rick. I’m glad you’re feeling better. I would like more song breakdowns and a major thing for me would be the ability to make requests for bands or songs, and be able to look forward to those videos.
I would love for your closest associates on the channel to do a video called:  What Makes “Rick” Great? I think we already know but it would be great to hear it from your pals 😊
Best wishes for a speedy recovery from Germany. As a loyal fan, I am very happy to watch your videos and have the benefits of your talent, experience, pleasant and easy personality plus the hard work you put into this. You are for me the confirmation that build a new mouse trap still works. If you ever have moments of self doubt then come back to this and messages like it to give you strength that you have purpose and meaning. Thank you so much.
Wish well and may God take care of you.
My second wife had mitral valve prolapse and the replacement was done in 2002 by Louis Prevosti, now of Vein-o-vations in Atlanta. From childhood until 2002 her heartbeat sounded like bump-squish, bump-squish. Starts out benign and gets scary when you’re older.
Wellcome to the mitral valve surgery club. :-) Glad to hear it was also successful for you. I wonder how that works in the US. I am from Germany and we have a great health system here. I did not have to pay anything for the surgery. I even got 30 bucks for a train ticket from the hospital. I wonder if the surgery is covered for the normal US citizens. I also wonder why you have no rehab after the surgery. For me, it was one month rehab and check. I'm curious, so if someone could tell me it would be appreciated. I also have to say thank you for your work. What do you do. it brings so much more joy to my passion for music as a music listener and a hobby musician. I recently watched the interviews of all the three police members. Pure Gold. Thank you!
More of what makes this song great pls! Love the interviews too 🤘🏻
Glad your ok! Feel better bro we need you!
Former 15 year Fairport Resident here. Had my preventative Triple bypass last October 12th here in Columbus OH at the age of 62. My appreciation for music has skyrocketed again since. I found your channel just before my procedure. Can't get enough of your keen insight and the amazing interviews. Especially Rush related pieces. (I grew up in Buffalo). Married an All-State trombonist (wife) that went to school at Suny Cortland. Still love that region of the country. I have ramped up my piano and keyboard playing to where it once was again.   You look great. I look forward to watching more of the great product you put on this channel.
So glad to hear all went well.  I’ve got open heart surgery in my future so it’s always good to hear nice reports on how it went for folks.  Love the channel!  Wishing you continued good health.
Hope you ll be well !
Hey dude… You’re amazing .....just glad to hear you keep on ticking.... Love from Canada
Cleveland clinic top shelf badass bless them all
Glad your well Rick 🙏🏽...do an episode on Shawn Lane !!!
So glad you’re doing great. GOD Bless you Rick🙏🏻❤
Glad to hear you are well after that surgery, friend!  Keep doing what you're doing with content. We need you!
Glad to hear that you came through with flying colors and take care.
glad you're doing well rick, stay strong!
Great to have you back and wonderful to see you smile my friend. Send you lots of positive energy. We Love you Rick ♥🤗
You’re freakin awesome Rick 💪
Wow Rick. It is incredible to hear what your body went through. Aren’t the medical professionals absolutely amazing!
On a mission right along with you. All the very best!
great to hear your ok. Your channel is the best.❤
God has blessed you with a healthy heart…and He has blessed us with you!!!
Mazel Tov on the sucess of your surgery, and the improvements to your condition of health, Sifu Beato! I like your interviews, and miss your song breakdowns.
Glad the surgery went well!  Enjoy your analysis.   Welcome to the Zipper club from a fellow member ❤
May God in Heaven Bless you all
Glad to hear your heart surgery went well. My father had similar surgery in 2008. I wanted to take him to the Cleveland Clinic or NYC, where these procedures are done all the time. He chose somewhere else, and didn't survive it. It's the one thing that still makes me angry all these years later.
Glad you are back at it, Rick!!
You're such a great guy!!  Godspeed!! <3
Thank you for sharing…. You look great for having surgery just a week prior👍 What kind of valve did you get?… mechanical or tissue?   I’m going to Cleveland Clinic in 2 weeks for both my mitral and tricuspid valves. I’ve been followed since birth for cardiac anomalies and have undergone 5 sternotomies. They’re talking about transplant now, I’m praying Cleveland might have a trick up their sleeve to just fix my valves❤
Wishing you all the very best in your recovery!!
I’m going in Monday for the exact same surgery
Wish you well.
Stay prepared for when you're opening up the medical bills. 😉
So happy you’re feeling better, Rick
Have loved watching your videos for years and have learned so much (even though I am a music snob and think I know all the trivia there is!). I had a massive heart attach in March (the widow maker) and can appreciate your recent event.   I live in a small town and drove myself to the EMT place at 5:00am only to find the doors open, lights on, but no one home. Drove from there to the fire station only to find the same situation (I did take a minute to look at the fire engines). Finally drove to a small hospital where they threw me in an ambulance at raced me to a smaller town. Five stints later, all is well.    Be aware that any time you have any kind of heart surgery, there is usually some depression associated with it. It goes away, but it is disconcerting if you are not expecting it. Good luck with your recovery and keep making the great videos.  Do you ever give tours of your studio???
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hey Rick. I'm just one of millions who admire and love all you do here on YT. So happy you are doing well.
God bless.....Good thing they caught that....Just lost a friend this past weekend....
You look good , Take it slow , Your in my Prayers !!!
Get well soon. You are doing important work. You are the 21st Century’s Karl Haas.
Get well soon Rick. Hope your recovery goes well and your back to full speed soon.
Wow your story sounds almost identical to mine. I had mitral valve prolapse. I was waiting for the regurgitation to go from moderate to severe before getting surgery. But unlike you I had NO symptoms. I was running 8-minute miles. I had the repair surgery two years ago at age 63. I was fortunate to get minimally invasive surgery at Stanford Hospital. Easy recovery, almost no pain.
Beautiful Rick. You are transcendent. An angel, with plenty more to give for a very long while, and even after that you'll still be giving, because we are vibrations and frequencies: souls. And you have got soul, infinitely so. God bless you Rick. Love and gratitude. Al Chapman, Peacehaven, Sussex, England.
Welcome to the zipper club ❤️❤️
CLEVELAND ROCKS
Wishing you continued good health and a full recovery. Hope to meet you sometime when you're in Rochester.
Rick, I didn't realize that you had heart surgery until now and very glad to hear that you are now doing well!
I am so glad you are feeling better. I had a heart ablation in 2018 and feel amazing. Your channel got me interested in Jazz and Keith Jarrett. I also love Weather Report and am trying to own all of their LP's. I am a guitar player, and I love listening to music. I would like to see production and studio recording tricks, and guitar playing tips, rare instruments etc. Rick, keep up the great work! 😀 Paul from Savannah, GA.
Glad youre doing well Rick! I also just had sinus surgery and it's incredible what they're able to do these days with so little pain and downtime. Modern medicine is pretty amazing.
So glad you are doing well and you look healthy too.
May God Bless you with a very long and happy life yet to come.  You bring us much joy, entertainment and education and you are loved by many who you don't even know!
Glad it was successful! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hey Rick, Sir,  Long time die hard right here.  I am so glad I came upon a lesson session 4 or so years ago and I am a loyal student for sure!!  As a session player in Scranton PA , play with different groups here,  and an almost there media composer I love to learn from you and watch you do the most in depth interviews I ever seen!  Thomas Newman.....my God that was awesome.  You working out a transition on the Shawshank score...Amazing!!     What I have been dying to ask you to give your take on the Unison Midi Chord packs..??  I ask because  they make my skin crawl and I get a little hot sometimes as a guy I know who an instrument is a foreign concept to,  Yet goes around bragging and arrogant as hell about how good a producer he is!!  AAUUGGGH! Just is good at dragging and dropping a beat , then a bass ect.... I have put in my 10,000 and going on 20 and take pride in what I've learned.  As do you I know this and the whole family here.......I think this Seth from the videos inspiring a whole generation coming up to not learn anything just pull up a chord progression and your in!!  NO!!  Not how it works.  One of the things I love the most about playing music is that everyone of us has our own personal way that we learn this or that and we make it our own.  I started to ramble please exuse me but do you agree that this a hindurance to this next generation?  maybe its the arrogance of the guy I know while knowing absolutely nothing cant play a chord on anything that turned me so against it.          Just my 2 cents here , I have been wanting to add something for a while now...( I'm nervous actually...its friggin Rick)  ...I am very very glad to hear everything is ok and your doing well!!  This getting old crap is for the birds I tell ya!  I just got a shoulder replaced finally and good as new its a great feeling!    Well Sir thank you for everything you do for us , your sessions are the best, I always look forward to the next upload!!  Noone does an interview like you do I have to say!!!    Also I'd kick myself if I didnt ask...... if ever you and the team are in need of a musician for anything you have going on...have a singer your producing and they need players...put me on the spot on the hot seat I'll deliver!!  ( I mean that in the most humble of ways just to say)  ...Thank you , be well
Thats just like what happened to my brother , after years of aortic diagnoses ,  slow silent but chronic  deterioration, suddenly he was acute in emergency , and luckily got surgery fast , survived with a new valve ❤ so its a fresh start and hopefully many more creative happy years ahead - … we are all lucky to be born and to live , a miracle in itself  🫶🏽😎 Stay well ❤
Glad you’re recovering.  Best of health to you, King
Excellent. Happy to hear it was successful and you're right back in it. As a Clevelander for the first half of my life I'm proud that you were able to get what you needed there!
feel well Rick without you youTube is boring
I'm so glad you are ok. (My dad died during a heart surgery. I myself had heart surgery when I was 3 years old. And eventually will need another one).
You got to say yes - to another success.   Best wishes - rock on.
watch out for radiation with your new valve  !!!
Rick, great that you went through it so well and that you managed to get up so quickly after the surgery! Absolute respect
Wishing you good health and thankyou for all your enthusiasm and love you show for music 😊
"R.B.!! Very glad you're doing well, my Friend!" ~  "¥a'D¡G¿"
Glad you are on the mend. I've had a similar journey over the last year 18 months.. and here I am.... Your video's are great. Personally breakdown of modes/soloing/ practice routines etc.  Hey.. I just turned 69 last week and improving my grasp of music still gives me a sense of purpose / accomplishment. Thank you Rick.
Wishing you all the best, Rick.
I worked as a Physician Assistant in Cardiology... I am very glad you are doing well... Keep on Truckin' Dude... My Best, Michael
Wow! I didnt know about that! Wow! I didn't know that, Get better Rick, take care and keep away in front of those experimental vaxes!
Glad you're ok.
No Les Pauls for the next 5 weeks, strats and teles only, and your SG. Glad you got it done while still being relatively young. Being 61 myself, I appreciate life more and more each day!
Happy return to perfect health, Rick!
Glad u are doing well
Holy smokes. I am in the same position but it’s my aortic valve. Severe condition and just hanging on until the day comes. Glad you are doing well my friend. 🤟
It's great to hear you are well Rick. A whole new chapter.
pls take care and God bless you
So glad to hear your surgery went so well.  We hope you completely heal quickly!
The Lord's not done with you, Rick! I pray the very best over you!  Ironically, the Lord is in the business of giving us a "new heart," and His salvation actually begins with that, as He changes our fallen nature & desires -- causing us to trust in the Person & Finished Work of His Son Jesus as our sin-substitute -- through His once for all time sacrifice on the cross in our place.  Here is one verse about that:  Ezekiel 36:26-27 "I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my spirit within you so that you walk in my statutes, observe my ordinances, and keep them."  Thank you for all you do in your effort to inspire musicians to go higher, be better, and to recapture the heart & soul of defines good music -- music that sublimely connects with the transcendent, and not for merely entertainment purposes!
glad you're ok!
your color looks better. you were very pale before. love the channel and music!! I'm a 60 model
Enjoy each day !
Best wishes for a full and complete recovery!  God Bess you.  Love your videos!!
Hola. Espero se encuentre Ud. muy bien. Los mejores deseos. Cordiales saludos.
Get well soon my friend
I think your channel is awesome and really informative great real interviews some of the biggest names in rock ‘n’ roll. I love your interview with Nuno!
So glad you’re safe and well good to have you back
Best wishes from England. Love your channel. Keep well 😊
Yeah Rick I’ve been out of the loop, I had no idea you were in the hospital, I’m so glad you’re doing great sorry for the late notice keep on playing you are an amazing guy love your music talent and insight, Keep on Trucking!
Be well, Rick. You are enormously loved!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations Rick! Great to see you so healthy!
So glad to hear you're doing well!
May God continue to bless you. You are a gift to the world!!
Great to hear you're on the mend. If your pace was slower because of your condition before... we'll never be able to catch up with you!
You're the best, Rick. Thank you for all you do, and for everything you so generously share with us, and wishing you a speedy recovery from your surgery !
Glad to hear this Rick. Of course you're a young man (LOL, I'll be 77 next month) so you have a long way to go. Always look forward to your videos and your knowledgeable opinions. Stay healthy sir.
❤🙏🍀
Glad to hear you are well Rick! Been loving your channel this year but I would loooove to see more what makes this song great! Why not a song from the last decade? Now there's a challenge for you !
Rick, take care of yourself, leave us alone for a while but take care of yourself!! You don't even imagine how important and fundamental your musical "lessons" are, you are always sensitive and so professional. From Italy, from my wife and I, a very strong hug
So glad you're ok, Rick. This world needs you, and great people like you.
Rick, I can’t believe you were in Cleveland and we didn’t get to hang out!  I’m glad our community here was able to play a part in your good health and longevity.  Your channel should be stored in the Smithsonian and be required viewing for all aspiring musicians.  Much love, brother. Come back to Cleveland soon and bring Joe Walsh, Chrissy Hines and Devo with you for interviews!
ben fatto Rick , è necessario avere cura di sestessi. Im proud to ear the news about the cure and  all is right now
wish bests Rick
wishing you all the best Rick
Great to see you healthy!
Rick, I’m not a guitarist, I just enjoy your videos and your passion for music. Good to see you are on the mend.
Congratulations on your recovery!
Wishing you a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹.  Just out a week and a half after a quad bypass (we had ours on the same day!).  Healing well, but slowly.
❤
Hey Rick, I lost two good friends to heart related conditions before the age of 40, and one of them played a huge part in getting me into the music that I still love, and which you've featured on your channel. It's so good to hear that you're on the mend and can keep doing what you're doing: celebrating the miracle that any of this wonderful stuff exists and sharing the stories and people that have given us all so much joy. Rest well, and God bless from South Africa.
BE HEALTHY
Rick, we so enjoy your program.......and we will be continuing to pray for your complete healing and recovery.  So glad to  hear that the surgery went so well for you.  Blessings from Pastor Jim
All the best to you Rick...👍🏾
Some Les Pauls are more than 10 pounds, watch which one ya pick up for the next weeks! 🙂
Deputy Center Director of CDRH, the medical device branch of FDA and a (poor) student of your ear training here. You picked a great place to get your surgery. I wish you a speedy recovery, my friend. You make the world a better place for what you do. Thank you. You need a better story for the mid-sternal scar though. Blofeld/James Bond laser scene? Shark bite? Matrix stunt double accident? Red Bull wing suit stunt with a turboprop gone wrong? The possibilities are endless.
I'm so happy to hear that you came through this surgery OK
Love ya Rick. All the best from Australia.
All the best to you!  It's good to hear your progress.
Glad you are on the mend Rick.
Great to hear this! You sound terrific!
Former premed student here.  My thought is to be very careful with it for some months to be sure it has a chance to mend.  Then, you should be able to live pretty much normally; except eat healthy foods, and don't do things that would put a lot of stress on your heart.  Best wishes.
Great to hear that the surgery was successful and your recovery is going well!
All The Best of Love ❤️  Grateful you are Alive and u-tubing 🎉 🎵 Happy!!!!!
Godspeed, Rick!
Get well Rick!
Glad to hear you are doing well, and better. And you are the TOPS at what you do and I appreciate it
I enjoy all you’re doing here.
Don’t pick up one of those vintage Les Pauls
Love you, man!
Glad you got a good outcome! One day they will be working on mine too. We are the same age. Best of luck going forward.
Good to know everything went good and you are already doing stuff with all that recovered energy!
So glad to hear that you're doing so well. You're 🤩 amazing
I love all the content you provide. And, i prefer the song break downs, since you asked.
Rick: Happy to hear that all went well and you are feeling so good so soon after the operation!!
I love song breakdowns like Roundabout! Some great Prog rock is perfect for your analysis. But even I Am the Walrus! ❤
Welcome to the Zipper Club, my friend! You're doing WAY better than I was at one week post-op!! Glad you're on the mend, Rick!
Glad it went so well Rick! I am delighted we have you back on track and healthy. You may get great benefits from some Somatic Experiencing (S.E.) Very powerfully beneficial post surgery. Shutting down your body with the anaesthetic is significant. Again, so glad you are doing well! Keep up the amazing work.
Wow! I had No Idea you were dealing with that heart valve issue, Rick, but as I'm just finding out about it now, I'm glad to hear that you're feeling back to normal already! U da man!!! And as far as ideas for your videos go, I had sent you an e-mail recently asking if you could start doing, "Why is this live Performance great?" and I cited a prime example of Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Steve Winwood, Dhani Harrison & Prince at the 2004 Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame Induction performing, "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", because, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, it was actually more Heartfelt than the original Beatles (my Fave band too Rick) version and Prince's solo at the end is absolutely Epic!!! I also cited your buddy, Peter Frampton, when he was doing his, "Frampton Comes Alive" tour back in '76 as another example because, as I'm sure you recall, he just kinda showed up outta nowhere and was like a breath of Fresh Rock and Roll air!!! After those examples, I'll leave it to your excellent musical judgment to move on from there! All the best Rick and please take good care of that ticker of yours!!! yours, Al Goodrich
Congrats.... I love you other channel too. Stay healthy and happy.
Glad you’re on the mend, Rick! Here’s to many more years!
Best recovery!
Looking good Rick. Glad you’re well How about a top 10 or 20 non musical intros. Such as Shanieka Twain ka-ching is a cash register, Queen we will rock you is 2 foot stomps and a clap that sort of thing
Rick please do a 10 cc profile!
Everyone loves you Rick! God bless ...
Bin selber in dem "Alter". Gut das Du wieder fit bist.Ich halte ,wie viele andere, Deine Arbeit für "wichtig". Peace,Love `n FunkyRocknRollMusic!
Belated well wishes Rick. Great that you were looked after so well. In terms of the channel’s direction, the output of interviews has been nothing short of phenomenal. So, so important both for people viewing currently and a very long time in the future I’m sure. I think we all love the song breakdowns too but you do you, man…
Very good to know that you are recovering well Rick. All the best x
Get an interview with Jagger. You can swap😊mitral valve stories
So glad you are well and still going on with your great youtube channel. All the best❤️
Jesus & Ronnie James Did are watching over you. Actually, ALL of us.  Seriously.........selfishly I'm glad you have been on top of this because thousands of us depend on your channel, energy, talent and overall positive part of our day.
You look fabulous!
Good luck with your recovery. I'm a huge fan!!!! I used to be a countertenor but had cancer and 4 surgeries messed my voice up. Cancer is back but I love watching your videos!!! Good luck!!!!!
YOu look like you lost a few pounds. Keep it up man, love what you're doing. I like the interviews
Glad it's in the rearview mirror.  Really enjoy your videos!!
Nice going, Rick. Good to hear you're mending well and getting back into it.
Great to hear you're recovering very well . Had my CABG done 2015, just turned 66 and alive and playing the guitar like never before. Have all your lessons and books and i thank you very much for that. All the very best from Malaysia!!
Very Glad you are doing better Rick.. Gods Blessings> Mo.
Thank you for the update Rick, glad you're ok and looking forward to more videos
Never Die - ever
Glad to hear you are doing well after your surgery. Cleveland clinic is the best place to go. My Dad had an aortic anthurium and local doctors wouldn't touch it. When he had the surgery, after opening him up it was different than they thought. He needed a special procedure that only 7 doctors in the world knew how to do. He happened to be on the table of the guy that invented the procedure! He got him for an additional 12 years because he went to the right place. Glad you're ok from another 62 year old!
Glad you're doing well.
Rick, so glad you are on the mend. Wishing you continued great healing and  health! Love your channel! Best regards, Steve
Wish you well Rick!!
Hearts and prayers for you and with you Rick!
We are glad you are on the mend. Best wishes from over here 😊
Glad you had a successful surgery to correct your chronic heart issue. Been a fan of your videos for many years. I’ve learned so much about music theory. Prayers for many more great years of health and music!
Congratulations!
Two things kill 99% of us . 1 . Heart disease . 2 . Cancer . Take your pick .
Glad glad glad you’re on the mend. You’re a treasure. ❤️❤️❤️
comments on the channel: happy for any videos you publish... but your health is more important!
fab news... get well soon... and: take it easy!!!
God bless!
We are all thankful for your successful surgery. You can be certain that many people were praying for you (especially including your family members and close friends), and all thank GOD that the surgery went well, that God guided the surgical team throughout. May your life be even more blessed.
Good job, get well, and take it easy and recover brother.
I had open heart surgery a little over a year ago, had quad bypass. I'm feeling great!
Rick: So happy to hear that you are doing well after your heart surgery!
Glad you're ok. Love your channel!
This surgery sounds scary AF.  Lots of health!!
You're 62?!? You look my age and I'm more than twenty years your junior!
Sending you love and strength with healing vibes and prayers for your continued good health and happiness 😊
Thank you for what you do.  Be well!
Great to hear you had procedure done and are doing better. Continued healing. I enjoy your channel.
To your health, Rick! 💓
Glad your ok, I’m 56 and have a prolapse mitral valve.  Its great to see your surgery was successful. It gives me inspiration. Glad you are on the mend.. keep up the good work.
So you are just a regular human like the rest of us? So glad to hear you from you and to know you are doing well... and selfishly, that you will be blessing all of us with more videos!
Best wishes for your recovery Rick.
Glad you are doing well. I just had a TAVAR procedure done and replaced my aortic valve so I know what you mean when you say that you don’t feel like anything happened. It’s kind of weird and most people won’t understand but that’s ok. Get well soon and keep on keeping on!😊
lucky we have the medicine we do today man.  i had a couple stents a few years ago!  crazy stuff. You're the man Rick.
Glad you're doing better! I'd love to see more instructional material!
had the same issue in 2012 had  a mechanical valve implant to replace the aortic have to take warfarin to thin the blood to go through valve have it  tested every  month
I'm glad you're on the mend!!! Interesting insight about your heart stopping for the first time! We are all lucky as well as we still have you are around!!! Without being too obsequious 🙂  I will say you are an inspiration... a consummate musician, creator, interviewer, educator, and despite your "well earned success" a humble, regular guy! I'm turning 63 in September and since February have gone through 4 eye surgeries (2 retina) nothing compared to open heart surgery of course but yes it does "give one pause". We're not a spring chickens anymore! LOL. What should I do next? What can I do next? Not to slight any of your other work (it's great) but I love the interviews and the way you do them. I say... parlay your influence, regain the momentum...go for more musicians (especially under represented genres like Jazz), engineers (I'd love to hear more of their stories) and others in the music business. Not to put too fine a point on it but those heroes of ours...well they aren't getting any younger either! The influencer aspect of your channel has been exceptional as well. When you stand up for yourself and others- call out BS when it needs to be called out. I love it!
Hey Rick! I’m so glad your surgery went well and you’re back home to continue your healing. You’ve given me a new appreciation and understanding of music later in my life (I’m 66) through your amazing chats with all of the wonderful musicians you sit down with. I listen to music in such a different way than I ever have, because I understand it better. Thank you for opening my ears and my brain! Music is so much more fun and interesting now!
Good to hear your on the mend.🙏
Congrats on your successful procedure.
Try cardio miracle professor
Good Luck Rick and God Bless !
good luc
Glad you're doing well, Rick.
Good to hear you're doing well. God Speed Bro'
stay well!
I had Mitral valve replacement and they had to thin the septum at the same time. Mine was done at Emory in Atlanta during the covid lockdown. Get yourself into a cardiac rehab program. I couldn't because of the shut down. When I did it made a huge difference. Stay strong and healthy my fellow Metro Atlantan.
Glad everything went well.  I really enjoy your breakdowns.  Gordon Lightfoot - 'If You Could Read My Mind' is my favorite.
Glad it was easy. Stay cool.
Glad you're doing great! Keep up the good work!
Great to hear you are doing well..al the best...
At 70, and having cardio problems, you lifted my spirits. I always enjoy your musical analytics/interviews immensely, but this was a 180° shift. Good on you for doing this, it grounds people in their everyday chaos.
Really glad things turned out for you. I died of a heart attack and was brought back to life at 55 pretty common in my family. You either die at 55 or they save you and you make it to 90. I'm hoping for that 90. And for you too! All the best. Love your program😊
The very best to you Rick, glad your on the mend
I am a Marc Gillinov mitral valve repair patient as well. Had mine in 2013 and am 60 this year. I am a fan of both of you and realize how great a surgeon you and I had. Glad you are doing well!
Stay well Rick!
Probiotics and electrolytes.
So happy for you Rick. I’m in anesthesiologist and know what a big surgery that is. So happy that everything went well and you’re back at home. We love your videos ! ❤
Glad it went so well, Rick! Heal up !
Glad you're well again. I like it when you do the song breakdowns showing chords and techniques.
Wow! That's intense!  I wish you a speedy recovery! The heart is a miracle ..... but sometimes it needs to be repaired in time.  The rhythm of the heartbeat is the most important frequency in life.💓
Glad you're doing well. :)
Wish you a loooooong life full of happyness and joy.
From one old timer to another (I'm 62) - Great news to hear you're doing well, Rick!
Hey good luck on your recovery
Glad to see you looking so well Rick…keep well buddy 😁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I had the same problem but I took CBD capsules for a year or so and the leak went away
Glad you're on the mend! More power to you! As for the lifting, watch those Les Pauls! They can be a handful for a weight lifter. ;)  Hope you do more interviews in the future! Your Paul Gilbert and Nuno Bettencourt videos are two of my favorites and I've watched them multiple times.
Glad to hear you are ok.
Yay, glad heart fix was a success!  I'm a 60 year percussionist; still play 20 hrs/wk, up to 6 bands/wk. Lov all y'all do there; music breakdowns, interviews, all very well done.  Thank you! Looking forward to more! Bradly Scot
Well done old bean, get well fast..
Praise the Lord . . . glad you caught it and are on the mend. Blessings . . . .
I'm glad you're ok. I'm from Venezuela and I love the music you love. Take care of yourself!
Good to hear you are on the mend. Had an aortic valve replaced with a mech valve in 2017. Born with a regurgitation. Was no problem - played hockey, did all the stupid stuff young guys do. Eventually got a bad infection which further destroyed the valve and surgery was the only option. Was so surprise when a week passed and they kicked me out. Within a few months was doing light workouts, mountain biking and big kayak trips. During my recovery, I reintroduced myself to my guitar, found your vids, and I'm so grateful I did. Good to hear you are on the mend!
speedy recovery Rick, we need more of you!
Love love your channel!! So happy you are on the mend! I wanted to add to your greatest riff video one that wasn’t mentioned and that is the live “Crossroads” “Eric Clapton, please on vocals”👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😄 Take care, friend. ❤
All the best Rick take care 🌈
You've got a beautiful heart and it's become stronger :)
Hey Rick,  You definitely have a heart. Your videos are full of heart.  I didn't actually know you had a heart issue. I only found your channel about a year ago and never heard you say anything about it.  I'm glad you had a tuneup and the engine is running fine.  Regarding what you do on the show, I think the way you're already doing it works quite well. I really enjoy your interviews, but heh, maybe some playing would be nice to. Just take care of yourself.  Matt - Toronto, Canada
Congratulations on the recovery Rick! That's good you did it....I think the channel could be more dedicated to uprising musicians....cheers!
Much love to you Rick
Thans god You are back...and well....
Good to hear things are going well...stay healthy...make more vids...love 'em
God Bless You And Your Family With Good Health Happiness And Prosperity 🙏
So glad you're doing well!
Keep on rocking you’re absolutely awesome.
Glad to hear that the surgery went well.  Looking forward to more videos.  Congrats.
🙏🏽🎶🤘🏽❤
Get well and keep rockin', Rick!
Music breakdowns, and hearing your life stories, is why I am here :)
Great medical facility!  (My wife has it, but not much leakage, yet).  Your videos bring me great joy!  All the best.
Went through the same thing a few years ago. I'm still kicking.
Rick, thank you for this health update and thank you for your channel. I enjoy the breadth of what you do. Would you be interested in giving us a “What Makes This Song Great?” episode on Jose Feliciano’s cover of “Light My Fire”? I wish for you a continued and full recovery.
So glad to hear you're doing well! I enjoy both the song breakdowns and interviews. Keep up the great work.
Take care of you...
Glad to hear your story and good recovery Rick! I'm a big fan of your videos!
Our Rick, really glad you are OK !!!!
My mom had the same thing and same build up and talks by the doctor about “the next 5 yrs” etc.  but when they went in to fix the heart it was super calcified and a difficult fix.  She didn’t make it.  She could recover her lung functioning after surgery.  And  passed away a few days later in the middle of the night.
The best to you Rick.  Please keep those interviews going.  Hopefully music will also one day experience a recovery.
Love your content  . I wish you all the best with your recovery . ❤️ 🙏🏽 🎸🎶 ☀️
I think you do a great job - keep just doing what you do! Glad all went well.
Glad to hear you’re doing well. Keep rockin’!
Incredible recovery Rick! I had my Aortic valve replaced along with my entire Aortic root. I felt like I'd been run over by a bus for a month after and it took a year to get back to feeling about 70% well.
very well , back to give us beautiful videos thank you best regard fron Tuscany Italy
All the best for your recovery, Rick. Love your channel…still need to get to your Guitar lessons… Boundsy from Downunder
Thank you Rick for all you do.  You are way too young to have this problem.  Did the docs say why this happened to you?  What was the cause?  I hope the best for you going forward.
All the best Rick.. Stay healthy and ♪♫♪♫ ♥
Great to see you back, Rick
You lost a ton of weight
Glad you’re on the mend! Keep rolling forward brother!
Take care, i will pray for you 🙏
get well soon man
get well soon brotha
Good for you Rich and keep up the good work. I think good music is dead but you hopefully teach the younger generation about how it was.
Fantastic news Rick.  Glad to hear it went so well.  I really enjoy your videos!
Rick , i had a leaky valve also, had it replaced with a cow's tissue about 4 years ago, I'm 72 years old and doing great. Glad to hear your doing great also. Keep up the good work.
If you can't lift anything over ten pounds then how are you gonna take a leak???!! Love your videos man!
So glad you faced the music, had the procedure, and are doing well. I love your content and really appreciate all the time you put into it!  As for content going forward, your song breakdowns are outstanding. We would love more. And if you could make a couple more focused on songs by Rush, that would be super outstanding, ‘eh.
Love your channel,really all the things you do happy to hear it went so well for you.
Hey Rick!! Nice to see you back in the saddle!! Be safe and take care of yourself, really like the breakdowns!
The Cleveland Clinic is the best heart hospital in the world, glad to see you doing so well.
Happy to hear that you got your ticker refurbished, Rick. We need you around around here for many years to come. Hope to see more "What makes This Song Great" videos coming. Love `em!
Best wishes, take a nice break!
Glad you are on the mend Rick !  You have given us so much...thank you again for all your hard work!
Glad you had successful surgery and hope you stay well and heal well.
Rick: Through your obvious passion, you bring joy and the excitement of learning to so many. I wish you all the best. I'm so glad there's still "Beat" in "Beato".
Rick, so glad you are on the mend.  We so love your insights - also finally saw you live in NYC last time live, fabulous!  Keep on truckin', we need your insights!
❤Glad you are doing well!  I'm 62 and have a prolapse..but no regurg yet. Your story is encouraging! Love the channel and you too.
You & your work are loved !  Best wishes.
Best wishes Rick.
Long may you run!
Thank God Sir Rick B. you're well and alive that's great God is good in your life, take care always sir and your family as well God bless you and your channel.
Glad you are ok, Rick.  Personally, I think you are spectacular at interviewing musicians, and so even though other things you do are great too, I try not to miss the interviews, so I would ask for more of those.
Glad you're good 🙏🙏🙏
Glad to hear everything went well...(I know and understand to some degree as I have an MVP w/ regurgitation - luckily, completely asymptomatic).   Love the channel and enjoy learning from it and hearing what you have to say. I am especially interested in what you have done lately - comparing new music to old. Maybe you could do something that shows how classical music had/has an influence on the origins (and more recent incarnations of) pop/rock/soul/R&B/disco/new wave/progressive/etc. music (like from the previous golden years 60s, 70s, 80s)...
LONG LIVE THE KING!!!
Wishing you the best in life, good that your heart is well.
Wow, great job getting through that!!! You look great! To me that's heroic, You deserve a huge acknowledgement!!! Happy to see you well today!!!
Glad to hear you are feeling better!  Modern medicine is amazing.
Good to hear the procedure went well .
Speedy recovery brother, wishing you the best man. Love your vids!
You’re amazing Rick. Stay well and keep on inspiring us…
Rick first of all let me say, I'm Sooooo Glad in my heart that u prevailed & are now passed the, Loss of energy thing....., which I for one know can be devastating.....,born the same yr. as u i believe I too have been feeling the lack of Energy thing like Never before ! In the process of having some tests done now to try and get to the bottom of this Frustrating situation....I'd not even have taken the time to pursue this had it not been for following you....(For My Luv Of Music), so not only have I enhanced my music theory knowledge as a result of following you, Andy Wood, etc. I also , Strictly because of you gained the insight to pursue the test that will hopefully get to the bottom of my physical dilemma....Thank You, for All that you do RICK to make Our world a better place!!!!

You look great Rick!
Wishing you a speedy and full recovery. Sounds like you are on the way. 😊❤
Welcome to the Zipper Club Rick. I had triple bypass at age 49. Currently 60 and still kicking.
Good news. Glad you are "fixed"! More song breakdowns, please, sir!
Wishing you a speedy recovery!! Looks like you are doing fantastic! As an emergency physician, I worked with Cleveland Clinic and Metro Life Flight. It is a top notch place. Love the people there and very fond memories of the excellent care that I was lucky enough to witness and participate in. Great to see you doing your thing with what appears to be very minimal limitations.
Glad you are recuperating.
Wishing you the best of health Rick !
Rick, fantastic to see you bounce back from major surgery so fast! Best of health to you, and looking forward to a few more song and gear breakdowns. (But the interviews over the past year have been insightful--don't get me wrong.) Love the channel.
Hope you recover soon!
Stay well Rick, I love the channel - it's like all of us loving music talking but with your ability to break it down :)
Thank you for sharing.  You will help others, too, by posting this information.
Best wishes on recovery! Thank you for your channel. Music and rationality, a wonderful combination!
TG!!!
Hey Rick. I didn't know you were down. Welcome back. Glad to hear it all went well. Now...about getting back into "What Makes This Song Great" videos... 😄
So glad you are well!  Thanks for all the great videos!
Great that You are back Master.Thanks for Your essential works and presence
Glad all went well Rick! we need you to keep on keeping on!!
My dad is having this surgery and having a descending aneurysm in his aorta fixed( thank god the testing for his valve replacement showed the aneurysm) on the 9th. He’s nervous but excited to be on the mend and it’s nice to see someone doing so well after. Glad you’re on the mend.
Rick!  Thank God everything went as it was supposed to.  May God bless you!
You look and sound great for a week out of surgery and that you can play guitar comfortably is amazing!  Good luck on your recovery!
God bless you and thanks for sharing. I have cardio myopathy and will be looking at some surgery no doubt down the road. This helps! Peace
Bless you.    Glad you are ok and doing well.
Glad you’re doing better.
Get well soon. I first came across you in a search for jazz theory. Little did I know how diverse your content was and how much more diverse it would become! You are definitely one of a kind!
I am 72 and I had this surgery in 2017. I am good except that in the last two months or so the simptons started again. I might have to go back to surgery, not sure yet. I hope not. It is not ^the end ok world situation^ but a tought one. Please do not lift anything have for the moment (amplifiers, etc). I am glad you are OK. Cheers from Brazil!
You look and sound great.

Awesome news!! Greetings and best wishes to you and your family. Would you say it's time to examine: COMING BACK TO LIFE by pink Floyd?
Best of luck with your recovery Rick.
We the people, those who love music, love you Rick and we’re so glad you are here and on the mend!
I like your voice, your thoughts, your music stuff, your nice; had no idea of your medical condition and I'm so glad your back nice and strong again
Yes, we love you, Rick. Your videos give our lives a little buzz.  Thank you for sharing your brilliant knowledge and having such excellent guests. I was thinking today about your brilliant young son and thinking how blessed he is to benefit from all your amazing enthusiastic mentoring.
we love you rick!
Rick, impressed the way you talked about this serious episode... Sincerely wish you to hold on the way you do and get well soon! ❤‍🩹
God bless you Rick!  So enjoy your channel especially breaking down songs.  I also get a kick out of your your genuine enthusiasm for music and life. You have done much in your life and now all tuned up to run (I pray) longer yet!
i love you man stay healthy ❤
Well done Ric
Glad you survived your heart surgery! I'm 75 and I had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. 3 stents, and doing well. One thing my naturopath told me back then was: The stents relieved the symptoms, but you have a systemic situation of inflamation which precipitated the blockage. I've since changed my diet—especially since this last January when my wife and I went on a carnivore diet, as recommended by Dr. Paul Saladino, who wrote Carnivore Code. Get off sugar, grains, and most, of not all plants! Too much to say in a few lines here, but, basically, plants are not our friends! Sounds crazy, but it's true!
Glad to know you're doing well.
Wishing you a speedy recovery, Rick really love watching your videos.
❤❤❤
Be well, Rick.
Happy to hear everything went well. I love what you’re doing now and what you’ve done up to this point. I love the interviews and the song breakdowns. I’m interested in seeing what direction you think you should take. Because it’s all been great thus far.
like to wish you a speedy recovery,, love your channel.    john h  uk
Wonderful news and result. Best from Australia Rick.👍
Things you do for views.
Great news!  Love everything you do. Great channel!
Glad you are better... thank for you...
All good to ya Rick !!! 🤘🙏🩺🩹📈🍀🐞
If you don't change your diet than you are playing russian roulette with your health!
Glad your surgery was successful Rick. 😀😀🎸Welcome back🎸🎸sincerely, Rod Welles
Mr. Beato – I’ve been playing guitar for roughly 6 years and founder videos approximately four years ago during the pandemic.  I really enjoy the insight you have brought to both structure of music and the artistic creativity that you have highlighted in your interviews and your teaching.  Would love to know how best to be prepared heading into a studio session as an artist, any advice you have for the set up for a live performance and getting a feel for the room during sound check.  Incredibly impressed by your growth as a channel and your connectivity to your audience.  Thank you for your passion and sharing your gift for the next generation of musicians.  Incredibly happy to hear you are on the mend.
Glad you're ok
Hang in there man ...i had some valve work done also...had some  bands that closed the valve   hanging off... so it leaked....they re attached them.... all good as new...sadly they put an iv in left hand wrong and could not play guitar for 2 months since it was Numb... all seems fine now....Go to Cardio Rehab ..help just getting out....cheers
Welcome back to the world Rick. I am glad your ok. Much love manp!
Take good are Rick.
God bless you Rick and your recovery
So glad you're fixed up, brother! Props for telling the story so hopefully more people take their health seriously, and not sluff it off as everything is OK... until its not. Important message. Yer the best!
❤❤❤❤❤hello chao cac ban❤❤❤❤
I love anything you post
Glad you're doing well!  I think the interviews, especially the "everyone in the room" threads (i.e. Steely Dan's Aja), are amazing. So much is lost or papered over in music making that seeing and hearing about the chaos (both good and bad) feels more like remembering than "learning the history of/story behind."  As a kid of a recording engineer and growing up in the pro audio world, I saw little glimpses into these moments, but was very rarely in the room for them. Seeing how they all play out and the circumstances and thought processes going into them is great!
It's great to see you healthy & happy Rick!
Thanks Rick!  I’m 62 too.  🙏🏻
Glad you are back in the saddle, Rick!
God bless you Rick, glad you’re recovering and now you’re past your challenge.   Regarding your weight lifting restriction, no Norlin era Les Pauls for you for a while!
Proof that Rick has a heart!! So glad you're okay Rick!!
Gday Rick, I’m glad to hear you’re okay and surgery was a success. I’m happy with whatever you post on your channel. Keep up the great work thanks.
Wishing you a good recovery, all the best and thanks for your awesome work, from Montevideo, Uruguay.
Glad to hear you're well my brother. God bless you!!
Hi Rick, I had a quadruple by pass February..the surgery was at Sarasota Memorial Hospital and the surgery was performed by Dr. Jeffery Sells, my recovery was incredibe..You provide an incredible wealth of information, all done first class! Keep feeling better and keeping doing what you love, we love!
I love your videos and I’m so happy to hear you are recovering well. I had quadruple bypass surgery in August 2020. I had no serious symptoms, the blockages were found as part of my work up for a kidney transplant. I had the kidney transplant in March 2021. Recovered fully and feeling great, golf 3 times a week and walk the course. Greatful everyday for all my surgeons and medical staff and especially my wife and family.
Glad your back with us. may you have many years doing what you love.
Kia Kaha Rick…..focus on you and your recovery…..modern music needs you around for a long time brother 👊🏻🎵🎶❤️
Thanks for being who you are man.  Best to you
10lbs? Lay off the Les Pauls there buddy. Glad you’re well 👍
Hi Rick, thanks for your update ,glad you're doing well, keep rocking
I’m really, really pleased your doing well.   Channel: do what you do. It’s always good
So glad you are on the road recovery.
Glad to hear things went well, as far as your videos do what you do it's allgreat.
🙏 ❤ 👏
My dad had a prolapse valve and he had an artificial valve put in. He had all sorts of other things wrong with him like cirrhosis from drinking, but he lived along time with that valve! Trying hard to die the whole time. what I'm trying to say is those surgeries are all right by me and I'm glad yours went well❤
Love your channel Rick !!
So glad you came through with a smile. love your channel and your bon homie! keep feeling better.
You have a hearts that beat at the latin cuban clave rhythm.
To hell with suggestions of what we would like you to do Rick! You do whatever you want, man. We’ll be happy to support you, no matter what. I’m glad you are on the mend and looking great. Best regards from the Giant’s Causeway coast of Northern Ireland. 😄👍🎸☘️
Thanks for sharing that
I too am about your age with heart valve regurgitation.  Thank you for the insight.  I feel fine, and have an active lifestyle with no issues.  I have to admit though, I do get tired in the afternoon.  So yeah, thanks.  I’ll pay attention.
I think you are an amazing interviewer. But do miss the breakdowns. Because you truly are a musician. And for those of us who aren't as amazing. It truly helps. But love your connection with artists. Keep up the good work. God is smiling at you.
I'm so glad you're feeling healthy after your Mitral valve surgery. You look great, and we all need you around for a long time. My cardiologist recently told me that in about ten years, I will need a pacemaker implant, so I can relate to your cardiologist telling you 4 to 5 years.  To answer your question on what what type of content that I would personally like to see and hear on your channels in the upcoming year, your judgement, insight, and intuition, appears to work for you and me, Rick. I am somewhat partial to your "What Makes This Song Great" videos.  Please give my best wishes to your lovely wife, Nina, and your three beautiful children, Dylan, Lennon, and Layla.
Your interview with some of the greatest musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries are exceptional.  I tell everyone to watch the interview you did with Keith Jarrett which really touched me. Hopefully we’ll see many more of those.  Glad you’re on the mend.
RICK get better hope to see you soon back on your channel with much LOVE make a full recovery we love you
🎉 Congradu:Geetings.. from Ireland  !  🎉 your a great man !
A big hug from Argentina!
Great to see you are ok, music will heal you, and also our souls. Thank You for your great work ;)
Had heart surgery now twice. First time endoscopic, the second time via sternotomy. But it took me way longer to recover and now 5 years later, since the last surgery, i still have issues with water depositions from time to time. I hope you'll recover completely without any problems.
Best of luck Rick  Ask Kenny Aaronoff about his lifestyle.
Good to have you back and good to know you're doing well 👍
Wish you the best Rick!
fantastic.... we need you !
I've had mitral valve surgery too! Glad you're healing and recovering well! Best wishes!
Bless you Rick, i wish you all the very best my soul brother i guess we are the same age..and we should always be positive...let the music of our hearts play..❤
Incredible you had surgery a week ago . Totally amazing. You look great. Medicine is incredible.  God Bless you.❤
Glad to hear the good news Rick !
congrats !   Stay well. Thoroughly enjoy your site and insight !
It's tough to beat your separating tracks on great music and letting us hear what each part really sounds like, along with your explanations and commentary. More of that again please, I still think about those isolated Cobain vocal tracks now and then, and that was years ago!
Rick, glad to see your recovery is going well.
Glad your surgery was successful and that you are on the road to recovery 🙏
Take this channel anywhere you want. I enjoy the music breakdows, but then I happened upon your interview with Steven Wilson. I enjoyed it very much. I absolutely would like some more interviews.   It's just that your music breakdowns explain music to me in a way I can comprehend. I am not a musician..... But you have inspired me to at least pick up a guitar and try out your course.
Hello Rick, wishing you rapid recovery it sounds like you’re on your way you make a huge impact as you know. Thank you very much for that and enriching our lives as all the artist do keep up the good work.
Glad you're on the mend, Rick.
Rick,Stay well and safe. You made the right decision to share your experience. You are continuing to educate as you love to do. May you continue to get stronger and make a full recovery.
Good to hear all went successful. Discovered your channel the day before yesterday, watched about 30 or so videos by now, though it feels like I have been following this channel for years! Look forward to new postings.
Congratulations on your renewed health and big props to the great Cleveland Clinic!
Get well soon Rick.
Not allowed to lift more than 10 pouinds, but can still play guitar. (Unless it's a Les Paul. Over the weight limit :p)
Love ya Rick, take good care for now, maybe wear a left hand "no fingers" thin leather glove to remind yourself not to lift stuff man  ;)  Eventually you won't need anything OR reminding but you and I know, the Rick in your head is stronger than the Rick in your body lol
I had the a quadruple bypass surgery almost exactly one year ago.  A week out of the hospital I was still very weak, and had to push myself to walk.  You must have been in great shape before the surgery to have recovered so quickly.  Take the 10 pound rule seriously.  About a month after my surgery, my computer emergency power supply gave out, and I went to Costco to get a new one.  I still have a phantom pain that has no other explanation, and is just now subsiding.
I’m happy to hear this good news. We live in marvelous times don’t we? I recently had a cardiac procedure and am amazed at what was accomplished. You make people’s lives better through music. It’s a gift and you are generous with it. I’m looking forward to more time with you!
FOLLOW YOUR INTEREST, that's why we love your videos. Or why I love them. You are authentic in your endeavors. Best wishes !
Rick, great to hear you are doing well! Love your videos!
Praying for you. 🙏🙏🕊️😭☝️☝️  No weapon formed against you shall prosper, And every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, And their righteousness is from Me,” Says the Lord.
Hey Rick ed from Welland Ontario Canada glad you are doing good now I had heart problems when I was 44 first heart attack had 4 more in next two years but doing well now at 60 started playing guitar at 55 play every day for one hour or more your show has helped me thank you for your help to learn well take care
Congrats, Rick.
Glad the recovery is going well.
15 years ago about a month before my 40th birthday, I had similar surgery but I had my aortic valve replaced, I had regurgitation as well, I had a metal valve inserted ( so I now tick like a clock) I am on warfarin for life, but it's a small price to pay. about 10 months after my surgery I did a 100 mile charity bike ride which I'm proud of ( I used to race in my youth but a broken back put pay to that) So I'm glad to hear all went well for you and you are fighting fit. Take care.
You are looking great Rick. Stay safe !!! Greetz from Spain, a fan
Rick, you are a gentleman and a scholar, a rare combination these days.  Please keep doing what you do best, making our days better, one video at a time.  All the best for a speedy recovery.
Take care, Rick. God bless You.
being dead tired in the middle of the day is normal. Take naps.
Bravo! Glad to hear of your best case surgery, wishing you years of great health.
Good bless and speedy recovery!
Glad to see you back on the track!!!! …a follower from EU…
Glad you're well Rick. I've learned a lot from you. And I've only been watching for a few months.
Rick,I also had mitral valve surgery this year.I wish I knew,I had a Dr here in NY who does it robotically and they don’t have to open you up the center.They go in through the right side. I could have left the hospital in two days. Best healing,stay healthy!
.🫶
Hopefully you will feel better soon!
God bless you Rick.
God bless you Rick. You are much needed nowadays ❤
Glad all is well,  welcome to the zipper club
God Bless you Rick. Huge fan.
I'm so glad to hear you're on the mend. As Clark Terry would say, "keep on keepin' on".
Glad to see you're OK. More 'What Makes This Song Great' please.
Glad your surgery went well and you’re well on your way to recovery, Rick!
Glad you’re well! Did they repair the valve or replace it with an animal valve or mechanical valve? My wife had hers replaced.
Amazing and gracious man you are! Wish you all the best and a quick recovery  and hope you enjoy giving us knowledge and musical pleasure in many years to come.
Glad your recovery is going well Rick. Love your videos. I am 68 years old and had my second pacemaker surgery last month, so I understand heart problems. Good luck.
Get well Rick, prayers headed your way
All the best!
Stay on the mend Rick ... we all love your channel!
Your back Rick fantastic!  Your heart is working good now and the surgery was text book. That's great news and we are all looking forward to new videos. Some Van Halen stuff would be really cool.
Rick, had the same about 3 years ago and feeling great (I'm 72) and enjoying every day (every day above ground is good),  love your channel and especially your tribute to Gordon  Lightfoot (saw him live and just exceptional), all the best from your Aussie mates down under.
Hey Rick! Love your channel so much! Glad to hear youre good as new, youve got alot of living to do! 😊👍❤🎵
Hey Rick, I enjoy your music reviews very much, kind of a newbie to your channel. I had aortic valve replacement  couple years ago to fix a congenital problem, so similar drill.  You look great!
Hey Rick! So glad you're good as new! You've got a lot of living to do! Love your channel.  😊👍🎵
Glad you're doing so well Rick.
If you don't mind me asking, how long were you on the ventilator for, Rick?
I’m not on social media a whole lot, so did not know about your surgery until now. Thank you for the update. I am happy to hear you are doing well. I hope your recovery continues smoothly and look forward to your videos once you are back to being 100%. Take care!
Glad you doing well! I really appreciate and enjoy your top 20 count downs. Looking forward to seeing whatever you come up with!
I'm glad you're okay, Rick. I enjoy your videos!
Glad you are ok Rick!  Love to see it you’re an amazing man
Glad you are well!
So glad to hear your surgery was successful. I had an Aortic valve replaced 10 years ago. Luckily,it was the most pain free surgery I've ever had( cancer twice so I've had a few)
God bless.  Glad to hear all's going well.  Keep on keeping on and do whatever you need to do for a complete recovery.  Your community is behind you completely.  Thank you so much for having the courage to share very personal information.  🙏🙏🙏🙏
Glad to hear that your surgery went so well. Long may you run. Your contribution to the guitar learning experience is amazing.
Can you analyze and teach Not guilty by George Harrison?
Rick, I’m glad you got through the surgery safely and your recovery sounds like everything’s on track. Your fans need you here. ✌️💙  72 year old retired guitarist here with a bad artery/heart valve. I’ve been medically taking prescriptions to treat the problem for about 10 years. I’ll be seeing another cardiologist as soon as the referrals call me. We’ll be going to OSHU in Portland.   One question. Did you need meds to hold off your surgery for that time?   Okay. Two questions. Did your medication regimen change drastically after the surgery. For myself, I’m tired of pills.   Take care and a speedy recovery to you. ✌️💙😎🎼
Good to see you in good shape! Just keep on doing what YOU like the most!
Great new Rick, from a fellow guitarist in Scotland. Love your videos.
Rick, you bring so much joy to the world! Grateful for your incredible teaching and musicianship. And so happy you're doing great!
I had the same surgery in 2003. Still alive and kickin'. Welcome to the club, brother.
Glad your better to play another day
Glad to see you recovering Rick! You and your content rock. Period
Get well soon mate 🎸
Congratulations. Best wishes. Stay well
Rick, all the best mate. Speedy recovery 🙏
As we all feel fear when our health play's up I also am seeing a cardiologist too for a damaged heart  I'm Glad your in good hands and on the mend your a good man
So happy to hear you are doing so well. Thank you for your videos.
Keep up the good work mate!
Glad to hear you are doing well Rick!
Whish you all the best ❤
glad that you're on the mend Rick.
Happy that you're healthy, sir! I always appreciate your videos! If I had a vote, I'd like to hear YOU play some guitar, on your channel! I've seen you interview and chat about so many of the greats but, to be honest, I know nothing about YOUR guitar work, I'm embarrassed to say! Continued health and happiness to you!
Congrats Rick 👏😊!!
So glad everything went well and you’re feeling better!
Good you’re on the mend. I have two heart issues one was atrial fibrillation then 8 years later arrhythmia Scary as hell.
Keep away from Les Pauls Rik.
Words from a complete stranger, great news! stay healthy brother ✌️🍀
All the best Mr B - you do a fantastic job. Your knowledge, unwavering enthusiasm and a genuine willingness to try to find the good in all music is admirable and inspiring. Going forward, just keep up with the great balance of interviews and song breakdowns and that'll do me. I woukd request that you feature the following three wonderful guitarists at some point: Rory Gallagher, Michael Schenker and Pierre Bensusan! Cheers - wishing you a full and speedy recovery!
I stumbled across your videos over the past couple of months after picking up the guitar at 51 and also watching your Stone Temple Pilots breakdowns.  Your demeanor makes your videos great to watch and I’m always coming away learning something!  I’m so glad you’re doing well after this and look forward to more of your stuff!
All the best to you and your family.
Positive waves to you Rick.
I am so glad you are doing good.
♥
So happy you are going well. You are a gifted musician.
Great that you are well! Since I follow your channel, I have understood something about the architecture many songs I love. Thank you!
Congrats, keep rocking 🤘🏻🤘🏻
If you've been taking the boosters, please stop. Cardiovascular problems are a common side effect.
Hey Rick- I have Mitral Valve Prolapse. Now I wonder if I should have the same procedure (I'm mid 50s). Maybe I'll hit my Doc up again. Interesting story & update- hope your recovery goes well.
Be well, Rick. I had surgery for a coarctation of the Aorta in 1980. I'm 60 years old now so I guess the surgeons did a good job. You'll be ticking for many good years yet :)
Prayers Rick.
I'm so happy all worked out so well! And the update is appreciated. Thank you!
So glad all is well Rick. Appreciate all you do.
You look and sound great! Glad this was successful. Keep on rocking!
Rick,  I am delighted that you are on the mend. Your contributions are valued moe than you know.  My request? Keep doing what you are doing when you are well enough to do it.  I love your absolutely unique interviews with the icons of the music industry.
So pleased this surgery has gone well for you. Respect to the skill and knowledge of your doctors. We value your deep knowledge and sharing of it - long may this continue. Best wishes from the UK.
Heal and Rest Well Rick
🙏🏻🎸🎸glad you are still with us Rick. Maybe one day I will get the pleasure of meeting you
Glad it all went well Rick. Your channel is a gift to music and the people who love it. So just thank you and hoping you stay on the mend Dude!
Best wishes Buddie .....   wow ....   so glad to hear youre well on the road to recovery.....   from a 63 yrs old ....
Congratulations.  We're so blessed to live in a time where such procedures are even an option!
Rick I always love your channel and especially your What Makes This Song Great series. So very happy to hear you are doing well and will be with us for a long time to come. Look forward to all that you do all the time!
From the first day I watched your music theory videos, song breakdowns, and interviews my musicianship has grown like it never has before. You are a guiding light in my life and the lives of others and from the bottom of my heart I say thank you, thank you, thank you ❤ Peace, love, and happiness ❤
Retired Cardiac ICU RN here. I have to ask, where you not eligible for minimally invasive MVR? I know at least three surgeons in Atlanta that do it. Lateral approach. One has been doing it robotically for years. Less risk. Glad you're still above ground. I'm sure you were a dream patient for the staff.
You are such a treasure to so many of rock n rollers and we are sooooooo glad youre going to be ok..God Bless You.....
Aortic Valve for me Rick, feeling great 4 years later. Great to hear all went well
Best wishes, Sir.
I'm 33 years old, usually all my physicals and blood tests come back great. So never thought anything was wrong. Felt tired for a while a couple of years ago. Later was diagnosed with sleep apnea. Got treatment for that and was great again. Had an EKG that was abnormal so I had a echocardiography stress test done. My doctor messaged me and said hey your results were good, thought nothing more of it. Decided to read the results about a year later as interpreted by a cardiologist. He said hey you have some trabeculations(like mini dividers in your heart. Please get a cardiac MRI to rule out noncompacted cardiomyopathy. Did the MRI a few months ago and my ejection fraction is down to 41 percent from 60 percent. Saw a cardiologist after the MRI and he said my aortic valve has regurgitation we should do a transesophogeal echocardiogram to see better how bad it is. It's pretty bad and we'll be doing an angiogram soon to come up with which method will be needed to fix it. Had I never read that test result from a year ago I may have never known and who knows I could have had a heart attack and died suddenly. Glad I was just curious one day. Glad your better now Rick and hopefully I'll get mine done soon and be better too. I'm only 33 I've barely lived a life. Would love to keep going.
So good to hear, I love you Man!
Rick I’m a cardiac nurse anesthetist. Wow you look amazing for having open heart surgery so recently.  Hoping you continue a smooth recovery. Keep on playing that guitar!
Hey Rick, 55 yr old heart attack patient here. I had a heart attack back on January 1. Had 2 stents put in and I feel good. (I need to start taking better care of myself) I’m glad to see you on the mend. I love your videos and your channel.  Bless your heart…and while we’re at it; bless you too! Mike
Get well Rick
Real happy to see you doing well my Friend big love from MC. Motorcycle builder and A Drumer love you brother .
Glad to hear that you're doing well Rick!, we wish you always the best of things. For me, I hope to see you make more song-breakdowns again in the future. Stay healthy and well ❤
I don’t understand most of what you’re saying when you talk about the technical aspects of music theory, but your attitude and positive personality are so pleasant that it draws me back to watch your videos every time. But…No, just kidding. There is no but. Glad your surgery went so well. Keep cranking out the videos.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Praise the Lord. Take it easy man we need you!
Glad you’re doing well Rick! Heal up!
I'm glad you're doing well Rick!❤🥰🤘🤘
I was a surgical tech/ first assist in a former life.  It's great to see you doing so well post-op!  I had always heard that the sternal wires used to put it back together were the worst part of the whole deal.  You don't seem to be in any pain or even discomfort with that. Very nice!  Have you seen an increase in your energy level since the surgery?
Thank You Rick - Wishing you a speedy ❤️‍🩹 Recovery- Ian Anderson put a Health Care for Prostatic Cancer in the middle of his concert 🎶- He knows that his fans need this information-and we thank you for your updates
Continue to get better, Rick!
😊 so glad that you're doing well, and it was a successful!  surgery🎉 The interviews are great!  I especially like it when you get together with other YouTubers and talk about guitars😊
Hi Rick! Love your videos!  I’m catching up on your videos… because I almost had the same surgery as you about 6 weeks ago - in my case, it was the replacement of my aortic valve that was almost totally blocked.  It was a surprise to me - never been diagnosed.  I just fainted after a short run and then ended up in the fast lane for emergency surgery. Found out it was a congenital defect on the valve.  In my case, recovery was slowed down from the ankle fracture I got when I crumbled to the floor - just started walking again this week!  Best of luck on your recovery.  That sternum stuff is still quite sensitive after 6 weeks!
Glad youre ok Rick
Get well soon rick
Bless you Rick. Thank you for the update. Your community cares. You’re a genuine guy, and we appreciate it. Looking forward to your rehabilitation and new-found energy. Oh, the music parts as well. 😉 😂 Cheers!
I am so happy all went well. I love your show. As a survivor of A-Fib, Congestive Heart Failure and two Stents,we are lucky to have the medical world we have now. Rock On,
god bless you rick
Rick, I'm so happy that the surgery went so well. I'm even more impressed at how quickly your chest is recovering. I admire AND enjoy your work. Also, I like that you re-evaluate your programming. I did notice the rise in the amount of videos, but you picked GREAT guests AND they shared some of the lesser known technical information that would only be interesting to musicians. If the new direction is not particularly aimed at my immediate interests, I'll continue to watch, because inevitably, you'll come up with something that I may only learn from your channel.
So happy your ok, looking good my man. I love your song breakdowns & since we’re less than 2 years apart so many times you’ll break down a song, and like all great tunes it reminds you of days gone by. The only suggestion would be use your connections to get sent some new guitars or anything and evulate some good acoustic, some electric and some decent keyboards and box’s as a regular part of the show maybe monthly.  Recently I used some YouTube reviews to decide weather D’Addario XS strings. 80/20 bronze. I tried elixirs maybe 15 years ago and was so turned off by the dull sound. I know they’ve gotten a lot better but I was so turned off that the free T-shirt I got with a promo pack triggers my PTSD. But we’ll see Today, as long as my seasonal maintenance didn’t still leave the neck to oiled.  Thanks for all your tips it raises my playing from crap to ok. 😊 so happy your feeling good. John
Btw - My favorite content from the channel is the "What Makes This Song Great" and I would love if you pickup to do it again :)
Rick - thanks for sharing your story and I am very glad you are healthy!  As far as the channel goes, I love the interviews, but would like to see a few more song break downs and some episodes where you teach theory in a simple way!  keep up the great work!
I'm cheering for your recovery, Rick <3
I can see Rick enthusiastically doing the breakdown on the heartrate monitor. "It's beeping in F sharp, at 72 BPM. Cool song, a little monotonous, but that's definitely better than an off tempo bridge. Hey Doc! Does this song ever end? Oh no. Wait. Never mind!"
Best wishes for a full and speedy recovery.
ps. with this video you have taken away many people's fear of such medical interventions
First of all, it's great to see that you're doing so well... and that you'll be with us all for another 50 years. I love your incredibly friendly and down-to-earth manner.  I'm the same age as you and I'm so enthusiastic about the content you present, probably because I belong to the same generation... I would have loved to be a great guitarist too, but the roads are different. Despite that, I play the guitar with even more enthusiasm because your content always inspires me to keep playing with joy and curiosity, even as a hobby. And it stimulates my brain.   Best wishes for a speedy recovery from a male nurse and IT specialist from Neumünster in Germany  R.Sye
Much appreciated.  Happy you had such a good attitude and everything was successful
Great news Rick!….all the very best for the future.
I’m so glad you’re still here and wish you well. We love your ways of music and your innovation of discovering different tones and artist. Thank you so much. Wish you well recovery
We love you Rick 😘👏👏 Have the best recovery 🙏💯
Sou um brasileiro que admira muito o seu trabalho e que gostaria de ter sido músico. Mesmo que um músico amador, mas que soubesse tocar, ler partitiuras. Farei em outubro 70 anos e tudo que aprendi foi de "ouvido" e depois qu passei a acompanhá-lo, mesmo que eventualmente, passei a amar ainda mais a música e perceber que não é tão dificil aprender.  Obrigado e que a vida continue a lhe dar tudo de bom!👏🏻
Been there, done that.  I even still have that same little red heart pillow (shown in your picture) they gave me at the hospital.  I had my aortic valve replaced.  It's been 12 years.  Godspeed in your recovery!
I'm Glad you are feeling better.
I was not aware But I am so glad you feeling 100% Your channel is awesome !!
Just be well, that’s all that matters. 13:35 CET
Looking good. Glad it all went smoothly. 💪🏼
Hi Rick, i followed you videos for a couple of years now and watching this video brought me to subscribing your channel. Thanks for so many great videos, interviews and hints! Thank youso much! I wish you great inspirations to let you continue with this great work! Take care! Jan
I've prayed for you, glad to see you're doing well. I've appreciated your work, musicianship, and your channel here. I've learned and enjoy watching, and I thank you.
You can't keep a good man down
First of all, I'm glad you're well. I appreciate your insights of what makes this song great.
Glad you're well!  I was 51 when I had a heart attack and an emergency 5-way bypass.  I wasn't  back on my feet for a lot longer than you.  I'm 69 now.  Life goes on!
We'll never bench 2 plates again.
Get well soon, Rick!
Hi Rick, good to see you getting better,  praise the Lord.
Stay as well as you can.......do the rest of the well man stuff too.....prostate cancer is a quiet killer
Suffered from the same condition some years ago, and managed to figure out a non-surgical approach that did indeed cure the problem.   So it would appear that surgery is not at all necessary.  W.H.O. knew.  Always did.  Always will.  The Gill-inov, as it were.  It's all a blur.
Good for you! It’s amazing how much progress has been made with open heart surgery. When my Dad had bypass surgery decades ago, his recovery from the surgery alone was months. The first week in the hospital, the nurses had him purposely coughing to move phlegm and he said that was the worst part of it.
Good to know you are well 🎉
My wife had the same problem, although she was a little older at the time. She couldn't lift heavy weights either, which included the vacuum cleaner, so a Les Paul is out of question for you matey. I prescribe acoustic only for two months followed by two months of Strat lifting.
So happy you're getting better, Rick.  Judging from our ages, I'll be shuffling off this mortal coil five to ten years before you.  I'm looking forward to seeing one of your segments on my last day so I can have something interesting to tell to God.
Rick, last yrar I had AFIB leading to a heart sblasion operation. Take one day at a time. This year I am dealing with bladder cancer and hope we eill knock that out soon also. Reading my Bible really helps.
Very glad it went so well Rick!! ❤
very happy it was successful and you are doing better
Good to see you again Rick. Looking forward to your next interview. Take care man!
❤
You're the best Rick. Love all of it. Interviews, analyzes, top this or that. All of it
Glad you are doing well Rick! From a fellow former Rochesterian
I'm glad the surery went well Rick, I will pray for your continued good health.
I’m a big fan of herbal medicine but this is where western medicine is heroic! Glad you’re doing so well!
You have to stick around . If music loses you we are all screwed.
Over the past year, I've been recovering and your channel has been one of my go to's for mind relief and just plain fun. God be with youand loving prayers.
Godspeed on your recovery
There is a reason you are still with us. Thoughts and Prayers Brother!!!
me talking to my computer..." ...for 62 years!!" you got this!
My man Rick!  Sorry to hear about your heart troubles.  Glad to hear you had great doctors & are back on the mend.  Your fan base is huge & the internet wouldn't be the same w/o your unique brand of professionalism.  Here's to many more years to come, brother. ✌️😎
Vax complications brother.
God bless you, Rick. Glad you're doing better.
Rick, as someone who has had three minor (compared to yours and others) heart procedures, in my opinion what we can do as humans is relate our stories to others that might not be understanding the severity of their conditions. I had 100% blockage of “the widowmaker”, mind you I was still riding my bike 16 miles, surfing and playing downtuned stoner metal. When my first heart attack happened, I drove myself to the hospital. I had never been hospitalized in my life. I had amazing doctors and hospital staff and I writing this today because of them. You have shared your passion for music with us and we as a community have gotten to know you. Thank you for all that you do, both musically and otherwise. You are by all accounts an amazing human being! Love and respect, Bill Bensen
Glad you got it taken care of and are on the mend.  Enjoy your channel.
Super happy that you’re still on the planet brother. It’s not your time yet. Stay strong.😊
We’re the same age, and last year I had to have 2 stents put in, I had a heart attack! But, thank God they are so good at this stuff! Really glad you’re doing so well, love your work, and love your stories! You’re not just an educator, you’re a real raconteur!
Speedy recovery Rick, we all love you on this side of the screen!
Just awesome Rick! Here's to a speedy recovery! I've always enjoyed your vids when I've had the time. Perhaps you could do a video on how to rekindle the passion to play for those musicians who've seemed to of lost interest after playing was such a huge part of their lives?
God bless you Rick! I hope we’ll have you for many years to come!
Glad you caught this Rick and got through it. ❤
Glad everything went well Rick. My wife is a cardiac rehab nurse (40 yrs on the job) and she informs me you are going to feel like you’re 30 yrs younger now that your “check valve” is working again- your ticker will not have to work as hard to get blood where it needs to go.  So you’re all set until at least 2054 😅
Take care Rick!!
Rest up Rick. Now can you do a video on Metal lead guitar playing?
whish a swift and full recovery.
Cleveland Clinic will be where I get my heart work done...66 with an aortal aneurysm...we live in amazing times...enjoy your videos Rick...
DUDE!! (I don't often Dude people) I'm so glad you're okay. You obviously went to the right place and the right doctors. Welcome back!
I have a close friend - who I love and he has all his lfe had health difficuties . I pray he will be in better health. I pray you will get better and stay in good health Rick.
Very glad for the blessings that have provided for the successful repair of your mitral valve, Rick. 🙏👍😄
I am a physician and musician. In my career I have provided anesthesia for hundreds of open heart surgeries at Yale. You got this. You look great. In 2011 I accompanied a friend from San Diego to Cleveland when her husband had a complicated heart surgery. The Cleveland Clinic had a great restaurant IIRC. Don’t lift any heavy amps . Take it easy.
Godless you Rick
You look good. I hope your road to recovery is a smooth one. As Spock would say “ Live long and prosper.”
As far as direction of the channel I have been LOVING the interviews and all the behind the scenes stories
Happy to hear that Rick's doing well 🙏🏼✌🏼
Can’t lift anything over 10lbs but you can play guitar… be careful which Les Paul you pick Rick! 🤔😋
So happy to hear everything went well Rick!❤ I love your videos and you too!
glad you are doing well Rick!  I am thinking maybe I should go get my heart checked out now ....
Fabulous news that you had a great team for your medical needs. I, and I am sure along with others, am hoping the prognosis is very good for a healthy future.
THE TIME!
Awesome news, Rick! Glad to hear you're on the mend!
You are blessed. Good for you !
you will be healed completly Rick All our prayer for you thou, Greeting from Tampa Bay
Glad you are doing well!
Glad you’re on the mend Rick. Take care. we love your channel and really are amazed at your talent.
Keep on keepin' on, RB. Glad you're okay, amigo.
So glad the surgery went well and no complications!  Blessings to you Rick!
Love you RB xx
Wow!  I'm 77 years old.  My father died of a heart attack when he was in his 40's back when I was 11...  So, I've always thought the same would happen to me.  So far, I've had no issues...  I don't expect to live forever, but I still feel pretty darn good.  I hope you will now enjoy life for at least as long as I have.  God bless you Rick.
Awesome recovery, sir!
👍 Rick glad your doing better, take care your still a young dude with much more to do.
I'm so glad you're on the mend!
Speedy recovery, Rick! 🤞
Hey Rick, I’m 62 too, and I’m glad to hear you’re feeling better. I live in northeast Ohio, so it’s good to hear that the medical system here helped you. I want you to know that I enjoy the channel immensely. I have been subscribed for a while now. I agree with you a lot of the time, but not always… But that is what makes it fun, right? One hill I will die on is that the Beatles are the greatest… And I think you and I agree on that. All the best.
Cleveland, suitably rock and roll surgery!
I am curious. Kinda like having you around.
Wonderful news Rick! God Bless You Sir!
Long Life Master!! :) Cheers Amigo!!
Great to see you've pulled through without any complications! Stay fit and healthy,  bro, there's still plenty of work to do, and filling your shoes won't be easy! 😉 🍻
Good hear! My Dad had one and lived another ten years until he was 88 About the channel In no order Interviews Technically knowledge Song breakdowns  Hey just keep doing what you’re doing, great content. Can’t ask for more.  Cheers
All the best Rick. Keep on keepin on.
That's a great recovery Rick.Very glad for you. Your voice is the only thing that reminds of the intubation you had. But other than that you're tip top again. Everything music is a great phrase that captures all the things you did on youtube. You did everything from analyzing strings to interviewing great artists, song analysis, teaching harmony and so on. I think it will be harder to add something new or a find an extra, different direction. On the other hand, there is joy in repetition as Prince once sang. We're not getting bored!!
Glad you’re doing so well, Rick. The world ain’t nearly done learning from you! ❤
Stay healthy!!!
Glad you're ok!  Looking great!  Appreciate taking the time to describe this.  Could be helpful to others down the line.
I'm happy to hear you're doing better!  You were in good hands at the Cleveland Clinic!
Stay well, Rick. Looking forward to more videos.
Praying for a quick recovery Rick.  Thank you for all you do!  I really appreciate all your videos and passion for music and all the wonderful guests you've interviewed.
RICK, we wish you all the best and hope you remain active and healthy so that the musical community can continue to enjoy your great videos. Cheers!
So glad you are doing great, we all start getting problems after 60, which I’ll be this year in December. We love you Rick❤❤❤
Great Rick ! you're BACK ! ok it's a big deal, heart is  a big deal ! so it's good to see you with a normal energy ! take the time to recover too, it's important , and we can be patients too !!! ;)
all the best to you, you're a strong one
Glad you’re doing well!
You look great, Rick!
Glad you are ok, sir!! We love you!
Wow sometimes we never know what comes our way in life, God watched over you and am glad your back on track 👍😊
I'm glad you're ok! Wish you all the best!
What has been your typical exercise routine for the past several years? Just curious.
Wellcome back, Rick. You're and your work here are very important for us. A hug from Brazil!
Hope all is good Rick and the future is bright
MDs love you, so glad you are OK! Best from neuroICU and Stroke Unit, Prague, CZ
Direction of the channel!? You're a LEGEND! KEEP THT HEART ROLLIN
Rick, you provide so much to educate, inspire and entertain, thank you sincerely. Since I discovered your channel in 2017 I feel like I've had my first music teacher in 20 years! I wish you all the very, very best in terms of health, I'm sorry to hear about troubles with your heart and am so pleased to hear your surgery was such a success. Your metaphorical heart is as strong as ever. Please consider some content about Bruce Springsteen. A legend in many areas, and truly one of a kind, he is a criminally underrated guitar player. Much love, Ben.
Im interested in the business side of the industry. Let's see a contract, let's see an ascap statement, how does an artist get paid, how to keep track of royalties, Let's talk to someone @ a label about talent and pay. How much does it cost to tour. Breakdown a Taylor Swift tour, show, how much it costs to produce a show. Revenue breakdowns. Who get cut what. Stuff like that.
Welcome Back Rick, greetings from Brazil. 🙌
Hey Rick, glad to hear you're doing good after surgery. I have some health issues myself, good doctors are key to keep moving. Stay well. Love the content!
Glad to hear the surgery went well. Take care and take enough time to recover. 💪
Glad to here you are on the mend Rick.  Great reminder to stay on top of your health and monitor issues.  All the best!!
I’m about to have the same surgery.  Same valve issue.  Glad to see you back 👍
Wow I'm so glad you are recovering so quickly. Less than 2 years ago I had major surgery. It took me over a month before I could even think of actually being able to take a proper shower with grab bars and shower seat. I still get exhausted after doing so today. God bless and don't rush. If it doesn't feel right , that's your body telling you not to do it. Never take chances, especially of falling.
Celebrated my 18th "birthday" not long ago. Had my mitral valve replaced with an artificial valve and it kicked me arse! But SO thankful I'm still here. I have decided it is high time I subscribed to your channel my friend! You are a rarity on the planet: incredibly gifted and incredibly humble. Godspeed in your recovery.
Glad to hear you are ok and looking forward to your future videos and interviews . ❤
Rick, great news on your surgery! As far as the channel, follow your heart (pun intended) and do what you do. Your content has always kept me coming back!
Best wishes on a full and complete recovery Rick! Thank you for all you do!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Awesome news Rick!  To your question at the end... your interviews are fantastic and it would be great to keep those in the mix.
Hope you make a good recovery
Glad to hear you're doing well. I'm always a fan of your song and theory breakdowns. I've loved the interviews, but you have Beato2 so you can always slide some in over there.
My wife recently had heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, wonderfully successful.  They're great up there.  I'm glad you had the opportunity to go there and that you're OK.
OMG! the video caption scared the living daylight out of me,i hope you are ok now 😢❤
You're one of the few people I would give an immortality elixir to enjoy your existence through eternity😅❤.
love the interviews Rick.....focus on those and the song breakdowns sprinkled in between
Im a noninvasive cardiologist and deal with the same types of problems, im also a guitarist and follow your videos - im glad to hear you are feeling better, best wishes.
Going for an ecg in a week to check things out, im 46 and hoping its nothing serious. Youre story is great though, rick. Awesome news.
Love you, Beato! ❤
You are a friend to us Rick. Heart stuff. Glad you shared with your friends and God speed a full recovery. From your friends out here.
Best of luck and good health...don't be lifting g anything g heavy like your royalty checks for all that merchandise  you're  selling...best wishes
❤
I had a heart attack on May 22, 1998, and I'm still kicking so I wish you the best luck going forward Rick. Your channel, particularly the interviews, feel like something you should be getting paid a lot more to create by someone in the media business. I'm surprised a company like Apple, Amazon, Netflix etc. hasn't offered you an opportunity to produce more of these as a series.
❤🤘
Great news..!
Hey Rick, so glad you got the old pump tuned up! Love your channel and best of luck to you and yours in the future. Keep on rockin' dude !!!
Seriously glad to see you well Rick. I don't forget that you and your channel led me to rediscover my love of making music. keep on keeping on...uhh carefully.
Hello Rick! Glad to hear you’re doing well in your recovery.  Really dig the channel man. Keep up the great work. 🖖
Big Congratulations Rick on a successful surgery!!! My guy introduced me to your channel when he was looking for a place that genuinely got the power and intricacies of music similar as he had felt since childhood. He spent time working with local bands doing lights in late 80’s,-90’s,and certainly, as is so for you, holds the importance of timing. That time frame for me was spent looking for the best I could find to do heart valve repair, landing in Houston’s Texas Heart Institute at St Luke’s. While there, I carried a hand held tape recorder,earphones, and one tape, Whitney Houston’s newest, The Body Guard soundtrack. What beautiful voice and writing! Dolly Parton’s “I Will Alway Love You” makes everything better! ( including open heart and bypass…)  At 30+ years later I still remember living with that pre-surgery-fatigue- like-no-other-😳, and sure do understand how this procedure can play with your head.  Rick, we hope you know how many of us are really grateful that you are doing well and are knocked out by what a most excellent channel you have! Thank you,Thank you! Now, Heal!😎🙏👍✨💫✌️♥️
Glad you're well, Rick, and back at it. Glad for you and your family... and for so many people who love your work.
Rick, glad to see you're doing alright. Make us some more videos about songs you really love, what makes those songs stand out from the noise
Best wishes for a swift recovery Rick!
Very happy to heart that your enjoying great health after your surgery Rick!! Congratulations and continued good health and fortune in the coming years!!
So glad to hear it went well and your doing good ricksta....keep up the greatness 🤘🏼😈🤘🏼🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 3:29
Thank goodness that you’re ok and are on the mend, Rick.  I pray that you will continue to get stronger every day.  Life is a gift, and so are you.  God bless!
🎼Here’s to another chapter of music, love & laughter with good audience faves, friends & family! 😂🎶
I’m glad you’re doing great Rick!! You’re the man! I really miss the “What makes this song great” videos and you breaking down each part from the background vocals to the bass/drums with theory as well.
Speedy recovery Rick. All the best.
Rick glad to you are alright! Send you positive vibes for fast recovery :) Love you man!
OMG Rick!!! You and I have the exact same heart problem! Mitral valve prolapse is hereditary in my family and in 2013, the regurgitation got so bad it actually detached the valve from the heart and I got my chest "crac k ed" to repair it. I will tell you that I'm the same age and the concern will be the calcification around the repair which could happen in about 10 years, like it is happening to me now. Keep up the positive vibes, love your channel.  PS: picked up a Chibson Les Paul and I plan on getting your Beato bundle and actually learn how to play!!
Glad to hear you’re feeling good Rick..❤️
you go, buddy! I had an angioplasty 8 yrs ago. Feeling great. Be well.
Get better.
Glad you're doing good!🎉
Wish you all the best!!! Big fan from Montreal!!
Your recovery is amazing. My sister, who is your age, had a valve replaced, which meant splitting her sternum. Three-plus weeks, and she is still sleeping in a recliner (can't use a bed) and is in a lot of pain. Glad you are doing so well.
All the best, Rick! (I'm also 62.)
Get well soon Rick!!
facing serious medical issues always refocuses one's mind on our mortality and making most of whatever time we have, as nothing is guaranteed. rick you are a treasure to so many. wishing you a speedy recovery and many more years in good health!
Very glad you're getting well Mr. Beato.
Glad to hear you're doing well. I'm 76 years old and love your work.  I played when I was young but had to give it up. Please continue with the channel.  I'm from Cleveland and happy to hear you went to the Clinic and some of our museums.   Wish you the best.
Glad you're on the mend. Truly enjoy your videos, perspectives, and all the knowledge you share.
Welcome to the club. I had an AVR (aortic valve replacement) in '13. Still going strong. It's amazing what they can do these days.
Love to hear that you are getting back into shape, Rick. The channel is amazing with all those interviews. I would love to see more songs breakdown or music theory lessons with songs examples like David Bennet does on his channel.
Glad you're doing well, Rick!
My idea for your beautiful channel? Why don‘t you show us what music you love and why. It‘s really all about passion.
I'm nearly 67 and so very lucky to not have had any major health issues (so far). However, I know this journey of life is a one-way-only deal. I know I won't last forever. Many of our mutual heroes have dropped off the twig. Rick, you have always been an inspiration, ever since I came across your channel all those years ago. You have helped to rekindle my passion for music. I even tolerate your 'old-musician' rants 🙂. I wish you and your beautiful family all the love and happiness in the world. I love you, Rick. Celebrate life and music while you can!
Congratulations on a successful outcome. Went to see a local jazz pianist play the other night, he chatted with me during his break. Have you seen this guy on YouTube, Rick Beato, he asked me? Yeah, man, love that guy. You're everywhere. Keep on doing what you do, no suggestions other than live long and prosper.
🙏🏻👍🏻😀
You're still young and have a lot of life left in you. You are also a contributor to society at large. Live long and prosper!
❤
Figured for sure the Babies, Back on My Feet Again would be playing  behind this video  Welcome back!
superRick!
not curious, but glad to here that you re fine.
I am patiently waiting for the Pierce Beato Band.
Keep going and stay  healthy. Best wishes from Holland
Totally get it, had an ablation myself last year-stuff happens as we get older . .love your posts!  Keep on keeping on!
Feel better and best wishes.
Glad you’re ok Rick.  Can’t imagine YouTube without the best place for all things music.  Stay cool 😎
Rock on Rick!❤
Take care, get well
Glad you're on the mend. Continue your great work. I really enjoy your channel.
So glad you are ok and that you had such a great outcome…. Cheers to moving on to your next thing ….whatever you decide to do….
So glad that your health is inline and stronger then ever. 👍🏽
I had the SAME surgery in March of '23.  Like you, NO problem...no pain. Glad your valve is fixed & best wishes!  Love your channel!
God bless and speedy recovery Rick. I will be 60 in a month and had a few scares, but no surgery like that. Just a few cardiac ablations. Good to see you up and around already.  More drum stuff. 😂🥁🥁
Glad you are doing great!
May Allah bless you, Rick 🙏🏼
Glad you’re recovering without a struggle. I haven’t begun to imagine a world without my R. Beato videos. I have learned SO much.
May God Heal You quickly, In Jesus Name.
Glad to hear it.  I have NOT been the one using long pins into my Rick Beato voodoo doll.  I just wanted to say that.
So happy for you Rick!  As for the future, please just keep doing what you do.
glad youre still alive!
I’m very pleased to hear you are recovering well from the surgery.  Hopefully, you will now have a new lease of life.  Wishing you all the best, mate.  I’m not a guitarist yet I find your videos enlightening and entertaining.  Look after yourself. Regards
It's so good to see you back so soon and looking so good!  I hope you will rest and follow all medical advice, even if that means we have to wait a little longer to see your next video. Thank you for keeping us all in the picture ☺️
God Bless you!
So wonderful to see all the Rick Beato love and appreciation here!  Stay strong and speedy recovery Rick, clearly you have so much more to give this global community of musicians and music lovers...
Glad you're feeling better Rick.
Get well soon Rick you do a great job love your videos❤👍
Prayers and best wishes for a speedy recovery are already on their way. May you be bench pressing 300 pounds again soon!! Lol😅. And hopefully you'll be feeling enough energy to make another"What makes this song great" video soon lol.
✨🎵✨😎👍✨🎵✨ ✨🎵✨Welcome Back✨🎵✨
Am so happy for you Rick..  God bless you..  please take of yourself...
Good to hear Rick, you’ve clearly had a great surgeon, speedy recovery dude, those 4x12 won’t move themselves 😎
So glad everything went well for you!! ❤
Glad it worked out 😊
Рик, держись! ❤
I had cardiac surgery with Dr Moss at the Jewish in Montréal IT went amazing well Hé is an artist in the médical field❤  Hope that you feeling better 🎉
Glad you are on the mend..
Glad !! To feel you're back !
Cleveland? Did you not go to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?
Glad you are feeling better. That is what took my mom was her mitral valve. She was 89.
The interviews are great and stay well brother.
Wish you all the best... It's naturally that one begins at 62 to think how much time is left and what is worthy and what not
♥️👊
I had my mitral valve repaired in 1997…33 years old. Went really well.  I returned to an extremely active lifestyle including intense cycling, hiking and swimming.  I continued at my profession (Air Traffic Controller) for another 24 years.     Last Tuesday (the day after you) I had my mitral valve replaced (a bio-prosthetic valve) at the UCI medical center in Orange, California! We had scheduled it two months ago and, like you, am in active recovery.  Do what you’re supposed to be doing…put it the work and you’ll feel better than you have for years!
Glad all went well for you. We will keep you in our prayers for a full recovery.
Heal and be well Rick!
I‘m glad all went well! All the best! Greetings, Peter from Switzerland
Glad your well
So glad it went so well, Rick! CAD guy here and dreading the day I may need to get a bypass. But, your story helps allay fears.
Good luck Rick  Good health recovery ✌🏼
I just saw this video "Health Update".  I too am 62 since May of this year.  After hearing long time friend that she has a severe hernia between disks 5 & 6, that night I researched what's all about.  I came across this channel featuring this surgeon who has done all types of procedures addressing this type of injury and all other kinds of back surgeries.  He testifies that endoscopic laser surgery hands-down is the best procedure compared to all others when possible. He's been performing this type of surgery for the past 18 years and he's been a surgeon for 29 years.  Well, I was totally captivated by the videos I ended up checking out heart surgeries and the same benefits exist, again, if possible.  The procedure with heart operations I believe your aware because you mention robotic, has no narcotics involved, no extensive downtime, you opening up of the chest, etc.  I'm really sorry you went thru this.  I have a friend who exactly the same age as me, born on the same day and unfortunately he had a heart attack but is still with us.  I recently had a check up a couple of months prior to his ordeal and it turns out everything appears ok EXCEPT my triglycerides and HDL are very high.  In event, I first cam aware of your site I think about 4 or 5 years ago, i think your followers were in 300k range but suspected you were going to "blow up".  I clearly remember your son having perfect pitch and you did one maybe two videos on the subject.  The saddest thing you shared next to tonight's video, is that you have tinnitus.  I too have it and kept that a secret from my family and friends.  I let them know about it, you know, just so  they know that its something that can drive you mad.  I hate even mentioning it cause, do to talking about it to family and friends so they have an understanding of me, that i found out, can lead to bad nights lol.  I wish I knew how it was to have silence like you said you do have that freedom sometimes with your tinnitus.  The stupidest thing about my injury is that my friend wanted to go see this band De-generation at a place called Coney Island High on St. Marks Street, NYC, which was part owned by Joey Ramone and the band was playing in the basement. So, walking down the stairs I partly heard her say something about "speakers". Well  one of the following steps had a speaker mounted on the wall to the left and the darn thing all of sudden blasted right in my ear.  The musicians must of all "hit" there instruments at the same time, I don't know, I just bent over in pain.  Anyway,  I'm so very glad your operation went great as well as your recovery.  As far as future content/videos, I remember the stuff that I came across your site was all about music theory and I was floored.  It was really great and I recall the anecdotes that you shared as well, so i would suggest you do more of those.
I was sorry to hear about this. I'm glad you feel better now!
❤
Do full song tutorials
Be well, young man. Keeping a good thought for you, and yours.
Glad you're doing good Rick. We need you on this planet! You are the Grand Master of music elucidation.
Les Paul had quintuple bypass heart surgery (also at the Cleveland Clinic) at age 65. Les said they told him he’d now have at least another 10 years. He made it to 94! All the best, Rick Beato, thank you for what you do!
Best of Health to you.
I hope everything continues to go well. Greetings from Peru.
Glad to see you are doing well!  Take care!!!
Great channel. On the Mend!  I was talking with old friend and coworker from Boston- Fred Ravid and he said he knew you from Atlanta.
Here in Canada, the name of the surgeon is assigned after 3-4 years of waiting and going through specialists wait lists, etc.  As long as you don't die, your quality of life doesn't matter.  Once you have a surgeon assigned, and a surgery booked for 6 months from now, you're almost done..
Hey Rick:    Some scary stuff, any way one looks @ it. Way glad to see you up & about & feeling the more energy thing.  Future?  -I think you should do what's in 'YOUR' heart, no pun intended.    You have already done a lot.  Perhaps travel to historical sites & give us the history?  Spend some money & have fun!  {& take us w/ you}                                                                                      Best
Shocked to see the thumbnail, so relieved afterward! Semper Fi
Get well soon Rick, glad you are feeling better. Can we have more “What Makes This Song Great” - I love those.
Congrats on the successful surgery! Did they replace a valve? What the tempo set at? 🤣stay strong and keep up the great work! Your insights and ability to communicate through your channel make our music world better. 💪🏻🎶
As a veterinarian, if you were a dog, you'd be a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. And it's just a new thing, but there are a few places in the world now where this surgery is being done on dogs. Good to hear you're well!
❤
Glad it all went well for you!  The music community loves and appreciates your work 🥰
Hoping for the best for you Rick!
❤ I am glad all is going well with you.  I am one of those who love music but wish learning did not take so much. I find your work and the way you talk about music very inspiring. sometimes I share with the kids who I don't give an option to not learn😅.
Dear Rick Beato May the Good Lord Jesus Bless and keep you always ! Thank you so much for your Love of music and sharing your knowledge with such interesting videos ! Peace Always Brian,  Keep On  ! Stay strong and healthy with a Joyful Heart !
It's good to see You in such a good mood!
Well, I am so happy that you had it done and everything is great with you. I know that heart problem I’ve had them so congratulations on your surgery outcome and I pray for you and the future nothing but great things come out any doctors office visit congratulations hon.❤❤❤❤
Wow...amazing what doctors can do today. I'm lucky...10 years older than you and till now my heart is working well...let me touch a piece of wood...lol. But 12 years ago I was diagnosed with a cancer to my neck. But, like I said, doctors (medicine in general) are doing miracles today. Love to check your videos...Bravo.
So glad you are on the mend. You are one cool cat. Your knowledge and love of all things music translates very clearly in all of your posts. You know you must have a gift when Sting enjoys talking to you. There were points in that interview when he appeared impressed by the depth of your understanding of their body of work, The Police and Stings solo stuff. I hope you have a speedy recovery 😊
I am so happy to hear all went well without complication. You're the best! Live long and prosper as Spock would say. Keep on rockin' in the free world!
So thankful that you are doing OK Rick. We appreciate you!
Glad to hear your on the mend. I'm in Cleveland and I wish I'd known you were going to be here. Take care.
❤❤❤
Hey Rick, very happy to hear you crushed this very ominous surgery like a pro, keep up the great vids. Thank you
my former college roommate just went through the same thing last year, he's doing great and I'm glad you're doing great!
Hey Rick. Been a cardiac cath lab nurse for 30 years .    Sometimes they need surgery sometimes we can do a “mitral clip” procedure to replace the valve.   Glad you’re back and feeling good.
So glad you’re on the mend!!!!!
we are happy for having you well!
Rick, I had the same surgery 4 years ago (Dr.Coselli at Baylor Medical Center in Houston).  I was considering Cleveland and Dr. Gillinov.  My valve went bad fast and I was in pretty bad shape before the surgery, so my recovery was a little slower than yours.  But I made a 100% recovery, and am so thankful for modern medical technology.  Glad to hear you are doing so well.  Love your videos, keep up the great work.
now get to work!
Don’t be surprised if your still tired in the afternoon you gotten old ha join the club, glad your ok!! Love your show
Glad to hear you're on the mend, Rick!
Glad ti hear everything went smooth and you're back with more e nergy and health!
Glad everything's working out so well.  Hope the recovery continues.
So glad you’re all good and feeling great! I watch all your videos! My dad had a quadruple bypass two years ago. He got his heart monitor out on Wednesday. Life is precious, take care of yourself and ENJOY yourself!! You’ll be back 110% in no time!
Mr. Rick, glad to see you got your heart strings tuned up and healthy- you are seriously loved for what you do. Let’s keep rocking!
Hey Rick, I'm so glad you're on the mend. When we listen to your shows we become part of your family and we really care. You are a treasure and your technical knowledge with your humility sold me years ago. Keep rockin'
Glad you're well Rick. I really appreciate everything you do. Just keep going where you're curiosity takes you.
Great to hear that you are much better now! Long life to you Rick! You are in our prayers!
Glad to hear you’re on the mend. You are a national treasure that we all need to appreciate more.
Good for you man...best of health.
Wishing u all the best.  U r the augmented chord in a diminished 7th world.
Glad you are well again.
My prayers go out to you my friend, and pray the Lord keep you healthy here on out, just put all your trust in Him and he'll keep your paths straight, God bless ;-)
So glad you’re feeling better and did well with your surgery! I love your channel and great content!
Get well
Congrats Ricj
Hey Rick , sorry to hear of your troubles ( I have HF) .... I have not long discovered you and in no sense do I feel as though I am going to lose you.... ! You may look like a mafia hitman but you have the heart of a Rock n Roll angel ! Love your podcasts . Nice n Easy now as St Francis of Sinatra would say .... 👍
Thank God if You're feeling better, praise the Lord amen 🙏
Glad everything went well..wishing you the best🎸
Glad that you are on the road to a speedy recovery
Rick, you couldn't have had your heart surgery at a better place than the Cleveland Clinic (disclosure: I trained there as a head and neck surgeon). So glad you're looking hale and hearty. Love your videos and trenchant analyses.--amateur musician
Glad you're doing well!
God Bless you Rick! Praying for your full recovery to continue!
Hello Rick sir , big fan of yours from India. Glad to hear you are well and are healing up. Wishing you good health always and look forward to many MANY MANY MANY of your excellent videos.
No lifting Les Pauls for a while! SG only!
Get Better and Stronger, Rick.
Be well Rick. You are loved!
Get well soon
Get well, Rick! 🎸🎸
❤
So glad to see you’re doing sooo well!
Glad you're on the other side of this experience. Good health is everything, and grateful for you and your channel, RIck.  All the best!
Rumor has it that after peeking inside your chest, the medical staff  insisted "Heart Full of Soul" by the Yardbirds be your next What Makes this Song Great video.
Another YouTuber, Austin McConnell,  I watch had the same surgery a couple weeks ago.  I'm so glad you are both doing well. You're in our prayers.
Glad you're better! Just keep doing what you do it's all good!
Rick, I’m glad you’re doing well. I had the same surgery as a kid back in 1977😅 at the University of Michigan children’s hospital.  I was at the Cleveland Clinic last year for a hernia repair. War scars to say the least. 😊 Continued success!
We appreciate you!
Congratulations and God Bless you. It’s amazing you’re up and around a week after open heart. In the future, I would like to see you play more on your videos. You’re an amazingly talented guitarist and I really enjoy listening to you.
is this the valve job Robin Williams had?
Happy to hear your procedure was a success.  Have always enjoyed your work ang have learned so much.  God Bless!!
Glad to hear you're recovering well!
Best to you
Let’s focus on Barracuda (by Heart) Closer to the Heart (I think you did that one) Heart of the Sunrise and Heart of Gold. Get that theme going!
𝓦𝓲𝓼𝓱𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝔂𝓸𝓾 𝓪 𝓼𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓭𝔂 𝓻𝓮𝓬𝓸𝓿𝓮𝓻𝔂❤️‍🩹🎸
As a fan who’s a year younger than you—glad you’re back Rick! I was raised in Ohio and the CC has some great docs! 💪🏼❤️
So, new band coming..."Scars of Insanity"....or something like that...😂 😂 New single...Cutting Deep....B side...Stopping My Heart for You....( keep them coming)
glad it all went well Rick .
May you live a long live, Mr. Beato.
Godspeed. Thank you for your videos.
I didn't realize you were having surgery, but I thank God that it's been so successful.
Glad you’re Ok Rick.
Thank you for what you do and staying alive to show how precious life is and to take nothing for granted.
Strength and honour brother
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love your content, stay well.
Rick, I had no idea that you had gone through this wonderful but frightening experience until I saw this video today.  However, at some level perhaps I did know, because about the time you went into the hospital, I had just emailed several of my musician friends after watching another of your insightful, informative and inspiring videos to say "THANK GOD FOR RICK BEATO!" Glad you're back, and please keep doing what inspires you - it's a gift to the rest of us. George in California, still trying to learn the drums.
Rick, have you been to the Rock n roll hall of fame? I live in Cleveland area and have yet to go. I am glad you came to Cleveland Clinic and had your surgery. They are top ranked for heart care. Glad you are doing well and looking forward to more music education Rick Beato style.
Glad you're up and well Rick!
Godspeed always. Your channel is just great. Mend fast!
Thank you for sharing Rick and I am so glad your surgery was a success!
Keep at it Brother! I hope that in the future, because you have a lot of it,  you talk about rock / pop music in Spanish.  Glad you're here to keep the music alive.  Much Blessings.
I watch your vids every so often...love them ....but this one especially caught my eye today. My daughter is a kid with Down Syndrome; she was born with Aventricular septal defect, ie. holes in her heart where blood would leak from ..heart defects are somewhat common with DS kids. Anyway, she had open heart surgery at SIX months., surgeon was one of the best in business (Miami) and she's now 14 and entering High School and is a pretty high functioning kid. Anyhow, she does have a slight mitral valve problem and she MIGHT need surgery in the future. Ironically, the doctors have been telling me and the ex wife for years that she doesn;t need it now...but MIGHT in the future . Kind of like what you were hearing. Hopefully when she does have it, they can do it robotically and not have to open her chest  AGAIN! It was one of the most emotional , torturous experiences I've ever had wheeling her into that operating room and waiting all day to hear how she did, my 6 month old baby girl!! Modern Medicine is amazing. Anyway, I can relate...love your vids, keep up the great work!! Oh and BTW, My son calls me the Silver surfer...I'm 60 and have hair almost exactly like yours, LOTS of it, but salt and pepper (ok, mostly salt 😜). Take care of yourself!!!
Happy you could go to the Clinic. Woŕld renowned.  Have a speedy recovery and God bless you.
❤❤❤❤
Go Rick go. I’m 68, 50 of them rocking and rolling, 10 stems in my heart, 3 in my kidney veins and still producing and recording and teaching and so on. Ne t year I’ll be constructing my last studio (no promises) and never felt better.
Glad  to see you on the other side of this "adventure".  Enjoy your new healthy heart.
God bless you
Gad everything went great.  Glad you're here with us.
Dude! Did you visit the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at least? Glad you're healing and healing well.
I had an atrial valve replacement in '13. I know the feeling. And the I've got the scars.
Rick, you’re by far the favourite guy i watch on you tube! love all you do. Truly glad you’re on the mend. Much respect and love🙏🤘
Glad you are feeling better!
Well that rules out 70’s les pauls….
I follow a lot of your videos because I find your channel very interesting. I didn't know about your health issues. I'm glad that your surgery went well. I wish you all the best for everything.
Prayers for continued health 🙏 Video Ideas: Who are some of the early Blues players/bands that influenced early RocknRoll?  Another idea: Videos on the meanings of the lyrics of songs….maybe take a band and do a few songs of their lyrical meaning (or history how they were written)…any interesting facts around the making of a song and it’s lyrical meaning.  Another idea: After watching the Beatles “Get Back” and “Let it Be”…I am intrigued by the process bands/artists take in the producing of songs…the takes, the elbow grease, the dialogue and communication that goes into getting the right sound/notes…..and then those “Eureka” light bulb moments in the studio.  Of course I am privy to the 60’s and 70’s…even some of the 80’s I’m sure had some profound studio “Eurekas”.  Hope this sparks some ideas for you! Best Wishes 🙏
As I have been slowly learning to play the guitar the past couple of years, I've learned a lot from watching your song breakdown videos. I would appreciate more of those, as I learn a lot from your analyses.
I'm so glad you're okay!
I'm 63 and the ticker seems to be fine so far. But I'm glad you're OK and everything went fine. Not sure what all of us fans would do without your channel, we need you so stay healthy and live a long happy life. God Bless you Rick!
I am a heart patience also...So take care...I can't wait to jam with you...oh yes I play keyboards...
So good to see your health is back, looking forward to the next video Rick.
Rick, wishing you a speedy recovery. I really enjoy your channel.
Great news that you are recovering so well. Lots of love.
LEGACY  - Youea iura bs
God thnks you are Well !  I wish you a long life !  I thank you very much for all your Videos i like your Videos very much, i am professional Violinist and Music Teacher and Filmmusic Composer.
Rick- congrats!!! I just turned 68- born with a bad valve- and have had 4 of those surgeries . . . never fun. Also- been playing bass for over 40- every gig imaginable- I am now in Vegas . . . I have a concept for an unexplored way of teaching bass . . . we should chat! Best to you.
You can play a guitar as long as it isn't a Les Paul.
I'm glad the surgery went well!
Wonderful to hear you are feeling great. Hope everything is in the past and you are fit and strong. Greedings from Greece.
Hola Rick, en verdad me alegra que estes así de bien. Tu canal es uno de esos pocos que hacen que valga la pena que exista YouTube. En mi opinión, todos los que disfrutan la música deberían verlo. Sigue creando excelente contenido.  Saludos desde Colombia.
Sending all best wishes to you , speedy recovery, and thank you for all your videos
All the best, Rick! Nice job as usual
Glad you're with us a while longer.  Time is precious.  Keep doing the interviews and appreciating the guest musicians.
glad you're on the mend!
You better live at least 100 more years sir because you’re a national treasure if you don’t… I’m gonna poo on my front lawn and cry like a baby.   Heal up sir you’re a legend for keeping the music industry relevant in a tumultuous time. We all think you’re a super rad dude.
get well soon Rick ! take care
Wish you a rapid recovery
Our prayers are with you Rick.
Love you, Rick...so glad you are well....Love the video's, I learn so much from you.  Keep it up!
Рик, всего тебе самого наилучшего и железного здоровья!
Dude! I'm so happy you're doing well! Anything you do on YouTube is fine with me
Keep up with the long in-depth interviews as they are incredibly interesting and valuable music lessons. Also, so important from a historical perspective - everyone is getting older and we need to have "real" music interviews of the great musicians of our time archived.
Glad to hear you are well! Looking forward to more of your channel.
Tanti auguri per una pronta guarigione 🤩😍
All love and good wishes from North Yorkshire England Rick.
You are in my prayers, Rick!
happy for you.
I just saw this today.  I had a quadruple heart bypass surgery in '95, at age 44.75.  I have the same chest scar, plus a nice long one down my left leg. Like a Timex, I'm still ticking!  Stay strong, brother.
My grandson at age 17 started passing out after an EKG he was diagnosed with Brugada syndrome.  Which is a genetic heart defect  Each time he passed out it was because his heart would stop beating  The doctor at Cincinnati Children's Hospital installed alinc  monitor that was attached to his heart that would keep track of how often it would stop beating and for how long it was stopped.  Once his heart got to a point where it was not beating for 6 seconds and how regularly it stopped They took out the monitor and replaced it with a pacemaker., that will shock his heart back into beating.    They can do some awesome things nowadays.  This procedure actually saved his life because without it each time his heart stopped beating he was technically dead.  Eventually, it would have gotten to the point where it would not restart itself and he would die.  So it is awesome what all they can do for you because my 18 year old grandson now has a chance to live out a nice long life.  Best of luck to you and also I want to say I really enjoy your channel!
Your Health is your Wealth.
❤️
We could compare scars. I had heart surgery when i was 2 and half
Rick, I've been a fan of your channel for some time now. When I watched this video, I finally did what I should have done a long time ago: I became a subscriber.   On a personal note, about 4 years ago, I developed a case of Bradycardia (slow heartbeat), and had a pacemaker implanted. That fixed the problem, and frankly, I've never felt better. Carry on, and continue to do the great work you do.
😀Wonderful news, stay strong
Glad you are well!  I basically play cowboy chords on guitar and ukulele but I do enjoy catching some of your interviews; the discussions really open up some fascinating concepts for me.
Rick, I have a heart condition too and Im older than you but I am so glad to see you are doing well. I have more visits to the hospital than to go to gigs now. Great to see you're good. Take care my friend, you're a font of such awesome infomation and news.
I'm glad you're recovering well. Looking forward to new videos!🎸
Rick, glad you're feeling well. Input on the channel: continue doing what you love. Viewers can tell when creators are creating content they think people will view rather than sincere content that you're passionate about.
Hey Rick, My Dad had Mitral Valve surgery in 1963 at the age of 30 by pioneering Heart Surgeon Lord Brock in London. Despite being told it would need to be repeated within 10 years he never had it done again and lived a healthy life. He was also named Ricky!!!  Best wishes from Cornwall, U.K.
So glad you're OK Rick. I love your videos and your amazing musical knowledge and insight. Take care of yourself. All the best
So pleased to hear the surgery went well. Best wishes for a swift recovery.
Good to see you doing well. 👍
Rick, it's really good to see you well after such major heart surgery. As they say, music must have a healing power. Greetings
Good to hear everything went well and you're back in business 👌 I'm in the "zipper club" myself too, and it's quite amazing to me what they're able to do. Cut you open and tinker with your ticker, and the next day your up and about 👍😀
I wish you lock and more health in the future.
I just got home from TCAR on my left carotid artery. Proud owner of a stent now. Yeah modern medicine is pretty amazing. Glad you're doing well!
HEAL WELL.... THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO YOU!
Glad you are healthy now. Keep up the good work that you! Really enjoy your channel. Thank you.
<3
God bless you!
“Can’t lift anything over 10 lbs”. So Les Pauls are out lol!
Hey Rick, glad you're procedure went well.  I had a stint put in a year ago come Aug 10, due to blockage in my "widow maker".  Thank you for posting this and bringing awareness to heart health.  I've been a long time follower and look forward to what comes next for you.  Here's to a long and healthy life!!
Great ! That you're ok now Rick.  I didn't know you had a problem? But now you're back and doing what only you can do. I love your YouTube shows. and wish you all the best the universe can give you in future. 👍
I am so glad you made it through that surgery, I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to lots more of your videos.
Great to hear your on the Mend
Leave the biscuits and gravy alone Rick. I know you live in the south. I moved out here from Arizona and gained 16 pounds. Plus all the breweries are here too. Stay healthy and safe. Easier said than done for sure. We love you brother. 👍🏽🎸❤️
Great that everything went according to plan!
glad the surgery was a success!!  I do really enjoy your song breakdowns.  I don't know if you've ever done a video on all your guitars.  I'd love to hear why you love each guitar and what songs/artists you prefer to play with each one.
Get well soon Rick,regards John🙏👍🐈‍⬛😎🇦🇺
Rick, you are looking much better.
Glad you're on the mend Rick. I enjoy watching your videos and interviews all the time. Keep it going!
Love you Rick, so glad you are still with us. PS, had a STEMI in 2023, with 3 stents placed and doing ok. You are not alone.
Continued good health, Rick!
Your channel is undoubtedly the finest resource for music education, performances, and interviews, catering to both musicians and music enthusiasts. Please continue to pursue your passion!
Thank goodness you have been looked after.   Love your videos.    Be lucky.
You look like Anthony Bourdain
Glad you are on the mend.  Love the interviews but also love what makes this song great.  Best might to be to do a merge of the two.  One song with the artist where you both get to talk about a portion of the track. I think that has legs.  First up  Interview / Analyze Night Spots or Candy-O from The  Cars with either Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes or both. Get well!
stay well man
Get well buddy. We have all learned a lot from you. Thank you.
hope you're all good from now on Rick! Great to see that you healed so quickly from the surgery. Very best wishes!
Love your interviews Rick!! Glad you're on the mend!!!❤
Glad youre well and hope for your continued recovery, Rick. I really enjoy your videos
Rick I had my aortic valve replaced with a mechanical valve in 2015. You will be fine and have many many years of good health. Follow your cardiologist’s recommendations (those guys know their stuff!). We look forward to years of your interviews, lessons, and breakdowns.
I’m so glad you’re doing well!!!❤
The content for the future of this channel = whatever makes you happy my friend! You have more than deserved to be picky and do only stuff that really matters to you from now on. Not that you haven't done that, and not because of the heart surgery either, but as a reward for all the good you have done in these past few years of "Rick Beato Channel". And congratulations for the new valve! :)
Heh ! Welcome to the club Rick...you will enjoy every morning..waking up healthier...long live...
Gute Besserung!!
Glad you made it. Speedy recovery. Looking forward to more great interviews and "What Makes This Song Great."
God bless you ❤️🌼🙏☘️🫖
So good all went well! Welcome back! All the best to you, sir!
Wow! You look great for all that action! May you get health, healing, wholeness, and a thorough recovery!
Good job, Rick.  Glad to see you're well.
Wishing you continued healing.
Welcome to Cleveland! Next time, visit for a better reason! Be well. Thx for the update. You can lift a guitar, so all's good.
Really glad you are OK. To your question on direction for the channel, the almost involuntary passion and enthusiasm for the music as you break it down is what attracts me.  It is so real, which is so rare today.
all the best and stay healthy. I know what it means to be sick....(now doing well)
Very grateful that you are making this video, Rick. Along side of your healing up , you are doing your viewership a great service by letting us know that it's safe, it's going to be okay and there is healing after surgery. Bravo!
Rick Beato: I had the exact same thing done to me with, in the exact same way in 2009. I'm so glad you're feeling better. God bless you, and thank you for all that you do. I love your work.
Really happy to see you are doing better and already back on track! ❤❤❤❤
Don't miss your Warfarin. Did they put in an annular ring?
Right there with you, Rick. This past Saturday, I was a little too enthusiastic around the drum kit. My heart started to race beyond the ability for it to keep up. I passed out and came to, lying on the floor. From that point on, my heart was not beating right, at all. My heart rate was getting slower and slower. I was taken to the ER and they determined that I had a Full Heart Lock. Meaning part of my heart just stopped working. They put a temporary pacemaker in, and now, a permanent one. Must run in the family. My 2nd oldest brother has a pacemaker for a few years now from basically the same situation. The lowest my heart rate went down to till the surgery was 30bpm. His went down below 17. They had to revive him initially. It's rough getting old, but we are survivors. I'm glad you're doing well. Stay healthy.
Why did they wait If it was inevitable? You were stronger 5 years ago, the outcome is more likely to be successful then. The bill payer wants to save money by deferring treatment as long as possible. Letting people to become sicker before treatment.
Rick, I'm 57 years old and a novice guitar player -- a real ham-and-egg'er. My grandfather was really accomplished. He played in country bands all his life. Naturally, he tried to teach me a few times, when I was about 8 or 10 or 12 years old. I'd get really interested, but then baseball or football would beckon. Oh, how I wish I had stuck with it. Like so many others, I'm a lifelong music lover. And I always say: "If I had it to do over again, I'd go to music school" (and would've stuck with the early guitar lessons). Rick, your channel IS my music school, be it interviews, song breakdowns, or explaining the circle of fifths. Beyond being wonderfully entertaining, your channel educates. And it brings people together. I'm so glad you're on the mend. Be well, and thank you for all you do.
Rick, I just want to thank you for what you do. Your “what makes this song…” is an incredible series to make people aware of what is hidden in recordings. I used to play keyboards over 25 years ago in various bands but gave it up when I got married. I love the backstories on Steely Dan. What caught my attention was your report on your health. I’m 67 now, I found out back in ‘98 I have HCM. I have had a miectomy in ‘04 & two valves replaced in 2017 (mitral & aortic). Also in 2019 a Defibrillator pacemaker. I hope you take care of yourself so that we can all get more educated on the people that make great music. Thank you & God Bless! 1:26pm
Happy to hear it all went well and you’re felling better. Can’t tell you how inspiring you are to fellow musicians and followers. Love the interviews you have been doing . Would like to see more of that and of course your videos what makes this song great!
I’m really glad you are on the mend! 🙏❤️
Hey Rick!  I'm glad that  your heart surgery story is a relatively boring one!  I love your channel and have been subscribed for several years (I'm part of the 40%!).  Glad to hear everything went well and that you're back on your feet.
Hope you're OK
Glad that you're back and you are ok!
A bandleader friend had a couple cardiac problems (a wonky valve and an aortic aneurysm). He kept putting off the surgery because he had gigs scheduled! I can't imagine delaying heart surgery.  He's always been one of the most stressed people I know.  He had the operation, he feels great, and he decided that he doesn't need all the stress of arguing with the venues about pay, finding musicians, loading equipment, and getting home absurdly late.  He plays in other bands, but not his anymore. Good decision.  Good luck Rick. If anything's stressing you, maybe you can do without it.
Glad all went well and you are on the mend, Rick!
I had bypass x 3 surgery which the doctor did while my heart was still beating - no heart/lung machine.  It drastically shortened my recovery.  I met with him four weeks post-surgery and he told me to a.) continue refereeing soccer as soon as I could schedule games; b.) go for a bike ride as soon as I left his office (which I did, even in the rain, because it felt so good; and c.) to never use the surgery as an excuse to NOT do something I wanted to do.  All great advice.  I love your interviews with musicians, and especially your discussions with Tim Pierce.  Keep going!
I love great news! Keep it up! Hug from El Salvador 💙
Watching this from a hospital bed, not cardiac this time, unlike the past few. It is amazing how much better you feel, how quickly, after a fix to your heart (a stent in my case). I'm 69; I hope to see you making your channel to my dying day and having fun doing it. I intend to make that many more years.... :)
Rick, I’m glad you’re back on your feet so quick. I had my aortic valve replaced in January, 2004 at age 43, basically because I was on my last leg. My doctor at the time was thinking cancer, because I was so sick. It wasn’t until I got a second opinion that the diseased valve was discovered. So I, too, have the 4-5 inch scar on my chest, but that’s a small price to pay for the gift of life. Take care of yourself my friend. Love your videos and your channel.
i'm glad you're recovering well, man!! really good news!! :)  about your questioning: i love the content you put in the channel, the interviews, the music analisys, the breakdowns, everything you do really... so imo, just keep doing it the way you like it  be well, rick!! :)  PS: i read a lot of comments sharing some histories of heart surgery, so i will share mine too... my father had a heart attack when he was only 47 years old and, at that time, he need to do an open heart surgery... after that, he did two coronary stents as kind of a "maintenance" procedure... he is 71 nowadays, still plays his guitar with friends, drives from here to there, sometimes drink some beers and have barbecues... so, he's pretty fine overall and have a normal life!! :)
Glad you’re on the mend.
Just super glad your back and everything is OK buddy!!!    Peace   --gary
Quick and complete recovery, Rick!
Warrior!!!!!!!
Keep your recovery going Rick!
Ive did that in 2013 at 59... it was a life changing event. After 35 years i started playing guitar again. Started writing the songs that had been swimming around in my head foy years.. In 2020 i got my wife into the act.. everyone needs a bass player... now we play all the time. There is always  gig on the horizon... and if not we woodshed... It was the second best thing that ever happened to me.. Irene was thr first... All the best to you and your family...
Love you Rick❤
Glad you're on the mend Rick. I had the same issue & the same repair done back in 2018. Don't push it during recovery. I was a zombie for months after mine but looks like you're doing great!
Rick, just out of curiosity, are you feeling better now than you have in years?..like you didnt notice it slowing you down until it was corrected??
Stay safe Rick, we need you more than ever! ❤❤ from Scotland.
I'm so Happy everything goes great❤
Good thing about the surgery is if you don't wake up you wont know.
I had my aortic valve repaired twice but may need a replacement valve soon. Did you have a mitral valve repair or was it replaced with a prosthetic valve?
Get well Rik
Hey Rick, congrats on your successful Mitral Valve surgery. I had a repair done 13 years ago and never regretted it!
Glad you are back. Cleveland rocks in many ways, esp. 1 song 50 years ago that launch a band. I enjoy your videos, and enjoy yelling at clouds with you, though I'm 12 years younger. I hope you can do videos marking anniversaries of band milestones. 1 is Monday, July 29th for a trio from Canada, thought they burst on the scene together in Pittsburgh 8-14-74. Looking for more of you on YouTube soon, and everyone, get yourself check out at the doctor (note to self), so we can all keep talking with Rick.
I wish you a fastest recovery possible! God bless you!❤❤❤
See! That's what you get for listening to the unhealthy and polluting pseudo music of the 21st century, reggaeton!! Ahahaaha Get well soon and use music to heal yourself, especially classical music. High doses of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.
Take care of yourself mate!
Glad you are on the mend
Best wishes Rick Have a good recovery
Rick your videos are great, and this one is special. I am 62 too!  I love your "song breakdowns" especially Boston's "More Than A Feeling". Glad you are feeling well again!
get better, man.  You rock.
Robotic sounds like autotune for the heart. 😊
Hope you heal up quickly Rick. Had a heart attack at 40 - since then my life outlook has changed and I'm still preforming now at 63 as energetically as I did when I was 40. Good luck for the future.
God Bless Take Care!🙏
I know what you went through.
Keep getting weller Rick! You're really loved & appreciated. ✌️✌️
Speedy recovery Rick!
God bless you Rick! So happy the surgery was a success and you're doing well!
Rick, Magnificent you are doing well! I love your videos, even though I am a crappy musician and have no clue on what it is you are talking about half the time, I watch every one.  If you are looking for some ideas please focus more on singers. How they learned there craft? What they do to prepare? There history? Thank you and be well.
I wish you all the best Rick❤💪🏻
Sorry to see poorly! I really enjoy your channel! Speedy recovery old mate from across the Pond (UK) All the Best from an old mediocre noodling guitarist!
Blessings on you Rick
Welcome to the Zipper club Rick. I'm 56, and  I had a massive heart attack in 2019 when i was 51, i actually died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital but they revived me in the emergency ward, i had a subsequent quadruple bypass and was home 2 weeks later, and back to work as a crane operator 6 weeks later. 5 years on and i'm still here, and hope to be a lot longer. Protip: if you are over 50, ask your doctor for an electrocardiogram, it will find any issues BEFORE they become a heart attack.
Thank god guitars are not forbidden in your recovery. Get well soon Rick.🎸🎸🎸
Congrats Rick. Glad to hear you’re surgery was successful 😎🎸😎🎸
Rick, you look tired.
Rick, so glad you're recovering well. Please take all the time you need to recover fully before pushing yourself to satiate our desire for more of your incredible videos and interviews. When you feel 100%, would love to see an interview with Marius Duda of Lunatic Soul.
Sending you Reiki 💓
Get well ❤️‍🩹
Glad you're ok, man.
You are a winner ! We love you !!!
🫶🙏✨️
I watch your channel a lot and would like to thank you, wish you a very speedy recovery and all possible good health imaginable.
What a gift! You have a real reset and I am so glad you will be making more content.  A true gift to all of us❤
Glad that the surgery went well Rick
Rick, so glad you’re on the mend, that the surgery went well & you’re still able to do what you love & to share your love of music. As an individual w/o any real knowledge of music, can’t play an instrument to save my life but w/o question a lover of music, your insights serve both to educate me & to highlight my complete ignorance in the most incredible way. Thank you!  And many Blessings!
Brother Rick God bless you. I'm glad you're doing better.
I'd love to hear your take on the spiritual side of music.
Rick, All best wishes and prayers for continued recovery from your open heart surgery from a fellow Greater Rochesterian. Love your channel!
Best wishes to you Rick !! Happy to see you so well💪💪🏻
I wish you the best... Get a hug. 🤜🏻💥🤛🏻
All the best from Germany! You are such a positive person, something we need right now.
You’re a legend and gem. Stay safe.
I'm glad you are doing better, hope you continue to improve after the surgery, love your channel
❤
I am glad you are on the mend.  I am keeping you in prayer!
Good to see you up & about Rick. Greetings from the UK.
I'm pleased you have come through this. Wishing you many more years of music making.
Glad to hear you're doing well! xx
Glad to know you're doing well. Take care. You are truly one of a kind....super talented and a very positive and genuine human being. Love listening to you. Wishing the best for you & your family.
Hope you get well soon mate.
Thank goodness you were aware of it.
I wish you an  Iron health
Health & happiness too you first  Keep up the great content!
Glad you’re feeling good. Keep picking!
Best wishes to you Rick - may you live long and prosper!🖖
My mom had mitral valve prolapse and could've gotten surgery years ago, when she was in her 50's. A couple family members did it, but my mom refused. She was afraid of the recovery and claimed she didn't want to do it til it was necessary.  Fast forward to now, she's 82 and was at the ER a number of times for the heart , and diagnosed with A. Fib. Christmas weekend was spent in the hospital and the surgeon told her she must have the surgery. It was alot more than just one valve replacement due to the years, weakness developing and now A. Fib.  All that to say I'm glad you got the surgery and hope you continue to improve.
So glad you are doing so well! Just love learning the guitar from your lessons. I am sure I would not have even tried, if it weren't for you! You are a blessing!
I have the same heart condition and had 3 surgeries but it's under control now...glad to see you get it addressed....I went through it 10 years ago.
It's a very exciting video! Wow! I am glad you look great and feel great. Be well. We are so lucky to have you here. Blessed and fortunate you share your will and knowledge!  Thank you. Thank you, Rick Beato, for everything!  Sincerely; Maria Clay
Hey, you're looking good Rick. Take care buddy.😀😄
Very lucky. I'm 71 and still recovering from a triple bypass I had in January --but I'm still on the right side of the grass and rehearsing with my band again. I had no symptoms or pain when the heart attack happened --i just passed out. Even passed all my tests with no issues the month before. We never know....so stay healthy and doing the right things.
🙏
Glad to hear you're on the mend. Thanks for sharing, at the very least this os a great PSA for all the dudes out there to stay on top of your health.
My top 3 Interview wishlist - Brian Sezter, Marcus King, and Steve Stevens.
I'm so happy you are doing well.
Good to know that you are back in sharp. God help you to a full recovery.
Keep doing what you do brother I’m glad you’re doing well.
So glad you're doing well, thank you for updating us!
Congratulations on your successful surgery. Must feel great to have that behind you.
Glad to hear your health is improving. Wish a full and speedy recovery.
Thankful and blessed you are here for you and family. We would miss you, you're one of the good souls. I lost my brother to to this. Take care my friend.😊
Speedy recovery Rick! Thanks for sharing.
great news...  glad you are well
Get well soon Rick! You got a big heart!
Rick, DO NOT skip physical therapy. It really helps with recovery (quad bypass survivor)
Glad to see you Rick! Stay healthy!
Rick, glad the surgery was successful, and I pray that you have a 100% recovery.
Always happy to hear the words, "Successful surgery" !
I had a quintuple bypass in 2009. No joke. Luckily I had a great surgeon. I couldn't lift my arms for a week. Broken ribs were painful. I refused the morphine for the pain because the first time they used it, it did nothing to reduce the pain. I told them to just give me a sleeping pill and I'll sleep it off. 15 years and I never changed anything. I can't take statins either, they cause severe leg cramps. Tried them all. 74 now. Hamlisch (Max) was my music teacher and Marvin tested me for pitch back in 1963. Did several charities with Cliff Williams(see picture) and sat with Tony Sansone when he wrote Walk Away Renee.(Renee never existed and the song is about Hull Avenue in the Bronx, see the Catholic News, the song that made the Beatles jealous)  My 15 minutes. Glad you're doing well! Just to think, not long ago it would have been a death sentence and here we are!
Wishing you a speedy recovery. My mum has the same issue, I just told her about you, hopefully it encourages her to take the same decision.
Have a healthy recovery! 🤲
Greetings... Long live King Rick
Happy recovery my friend!
Get well Mr Rick!  We musicians and music lovers need you!
I'm glad you are ok, Mr Beato. Onwards and upwards!
Glad you are doing well.
Glad to hear you're doing well now. Take care, Rick.
Best wishes, Rick!
❤❤❤
Great news, Rick! Glad to see you back. Always a class, a lesson. Abraço do Brasil
❤
Dear Rick, I'm happy you're fine and everything is going well! I'm close to 70, I've already had two open heart surgery (first one in Houston, TX God bless doctor Sandiford and doctor Cooley), second was an A0 replacement and..  waiting for the third I'm ok, I do still play guitar and watch your tutorial. Stay strong, stay well, stay tuned. Love, Mario from Italy
Glad you are well!
Good MAN i Love SONG
I'm so glad you're okay! 🫀👏😘👍
Glad to hear you are ok.
Very happy to see you are on the mend. Take your time to heal. We look forward to seeing your return. Best wishes from South Florida.
Scary.  I'm glad it's over for you.  I hope nothing like that ever happens to me.  I have to take care of a disabled woman every minute of the day, lifting her in and out of her wheelchair.  I couldn't go 5 weeks without doing that.  BTW, you and I have the exact same birthday and are the exact age.
Health and happiness to you Rick. Thanks for sharing your passion for music with us.
Something on "Little Feat"
quick recovery
Godspeed Rick!
Rick, so good to hear you're on the mend! I've also got mitral regurgitation with talk of 3-5 years before I have to go for big surgery too!  So now, it's not just guitar lessons that you're teaching me! Just a thought... maybe it's your odd syncopated heart beats that helped inspire you to find something special in the rhythms of music that you love?
Rick , glad to hear your on the road to recovery!!
❤❤❤❤🎉
How much fun is it getting in and out of bed?  That was the worst part for me. Trying to sleep wasn't easy either.
glad your ok
good to know you're good!
Love your channel, Rick!
Prayers for a healthy and successful recovery ❤🙏
As someone who also sees his cardiologist every 6 months, has had a handful of "delaying" procedures, I'm right there with you 👍🙇🤲🙏
So glad you're surgery went well. Keep posting, your videos are the greatest.
Glad you're doing well Rick.
good recovery
Glad your surgery went well. Hope you'll continue to heal and grow strong.
Rick I am glad to hear that you are well. We experience hiccups along our life and roll with the punches. Life is a perspective of experiences, relationships and accomplishments. And are guided in our path by decision and destiny. You are very helpful and informative with the efforts that you do every day. We appreciate you and value our time together. Sometimes you take a pause and feel the moment. Because in the end these moments count the most above all else.❤
Life is precious enjoy your second chance of life not everybody gets that, please don’t give up the guitar interview’s. 👍🇮🇪🎸🇮🇪👍
Wish you quick recovery, we love you Rick! 🤘
Sitting in my rocking chair in Kiama Australia.  Love your vids and I feel like I know you as a teacher and entertainer who I’ve been listening too for a number of years.  Glad you’re doing well and we have medical science to keep us truckin’!  🦘❤️😎
Glad everything went fine. All the best with the recovery!
Good to have you back😊
You look well Rick, long may it continue. ❤
Good Luck to you and good health!   Enjoy your channel. 👍
Nice that you get your health in order! Yea, it's amazing what doctors can do these days...
Great to hear the positive heath update Rick. You are incredibly popular amongst my music friends "down under" .... it would be great if you would do a tour of Australia one day and interview a few of our legends live on stage. We'll be there! All the best for your recovery. Gus
Get getter mate
Ich bin 1 tag und ein monat junger als Rick, hab auch metroclip schon 5,5 jahre und noch nicht operiert, gut zu wissen was mich erwartet, Danke Herr Beato für ihr Beitrag.
Glad you are doing well. A lot of people think good of you so we want you to stick around for a while. Take care of yourself and keep bringing us that good music...
How do you play a Les Paul with a 10# weight limit?
Don’t die.  Music needs you.
One of good friends just had a heart transplant and is doing great so far… god bless
I love everything you come up with to teach us but I think it’s more important than ever to interview all the great older musicians before anything happens to them. The passing of John Mayall is a big one that is now gone. Keep with the interviews. You are so good at it.☮️🎸🎶
Just keep doing what you're doing Rick. Loving it!
Really great to see you back Rick, looking as good as ever. Now, onto the future !
You’re lucky, Rick.  When I had my stroke, there was nothing to do but pick up the pieces.  Regarding your videos, you need more Weird Al songs ;-)
Get well, man 💪
Glad it was ok and I hope you feel better and stronger every day.
Hey Rick. I hope you aren't buying the official narrative about food/health. You need to be aware of books like "Toxic Superfoods" by Dr Sally Norton and "The Great Plant Based Con" by Jayne Buxton.
I'm glad to hear you're doing well rick, all the best, Eamonn
Feel well
You have no idea how valuable you are Rick Beato. Totally clueless.
Rick, I went through heart surgery at 47, now I'm 60, and I understand perfectly the meaning of your words. Keep going, your videos are great and I want to keep learning and having fun from them. Warm regards from Portugal.
aging sucks(
♥
Hey Rick ~ Glad to know everything went well, and that you're recovering smoothly and easily. Love you and love your channel. All the best!
Onward and upward mate. Appreciate your contribution to my enjoyment of music and no doubt many others.
I’m glad you got the treatment and that you feel better. Take care. We love your videos and your way of looking at music. ❤
Sending love and strength Rick ❤
I did not see your post from 5 days ago, but I'm so incredibly happy to hear you got through this as well as you did.  I own your Beato Book Interactive, the Arpeggio class, and the Quick Lessons Pro.  Eventually, I'll get the Ear Training and Beginning Guitar course as well.  I need to get back to learning from them.  I've played guitar for 48 of my 52 years and started playing drums / percussion in 7th grade.  I've been in bands playing both.  IMHO, your channel is the best music channel I've seen out there... and I've seen more than a few of them.
I’m 62 myself (12-21-1961) and I’ve had 3 heart attacks, 2 strokes, 1 open heart surgery, and 1 stint surgery. Needless to say, I “kind of” understand what you are going through. Each of us are different, both details and situations, but somewhat on the same plateau health wise. I wish you the very best, I truly love your channels, and hope to see them keep coming for some time to come ! Best Wishes Mark “the Doc” Willetts
So happy to see you back and hear that you're feeling better. I have a long scar a few inches lower. Take it easy and don't push yourself.
You are a legend love you videos
Get Well Soon Rick.💪
Best recovery Rick
So sorry to hear of the health crisis. Depression can accompany mitral valve issues so it's good that wasn't a symptom for you. (There 's also post- op depression for some, which it seems you've also sidestepped..and that's great. The Clinic here in Cleve. is where you want to be for heart problems. They saved my father's life more than once, via bypasses and heart valve replacements. You've never appeared to be unhealthy- so it was a surprise to learn of this issue.  We all need to take care of our cardio systems...we only have ONE, no spares.
Well done Rick.   The song breakdowns is why I first tuned in and subscribed.  The big name interviews now IMHO are a testament to your dedication and enthusiasm of all music .   Your guests know and appreciate this and they respect you so well.  Keep it up man!  Your enthusiasm is infectious!!
Glad it worked out so well for you.  Hope you get all the way back to 100 percent soon.  Best of luck.
I have been praying for you Rick. So glad you’re better!  Jesus Christ is in control of all things and he loves you too🤗
Good for you. Stay well. 👍🏻
Take care...! My best wishes. BTW, I want some tips in music composition... How they do it. And some music shines out from the rest. The last one I had a go was " La Vent, Let Cri".. and it is so wonderful. Stay relaxed and stay happy ...!
You look great and I wish you the best.
I guess what would be helpful to me as a viewer, would be 2 styles of videos. One is, how much of a thing do I really need. Like are there overdrive pedals that can handle all the distortion most cover bands would ever use, or someone finally does a video with a live band where we really test how many watts are needed from tube and solid amps. The other style would be reviews. Reviews of new bands, new gear, all of these social media 80s style rock bands popping up, would be all cool to know your take on.
I really appreciate your openness and the details of your surgery. I watched my mom go through open heart surgery about 8 years ago. Always love your other content as well.
Happy for you Rick 👍🇦🇺
This is the best century  to be unwell🫀😷
Love ya Rick! Stay healthy and rock on (always)!
Glad to see you back!
Glad you're okay. Keep on rocking in the free world.
Cleveland Clinic is quite a place. I went there to get diagnosed with POTS/Dysautonomia. Glad you're doing well my friend!
Hope your recuperation continues well Rick. I had the same surgery 9 years ago and feel fitter today than 20 years ago.  Stay positive.
Great to see you “recovered” take it easy man & keep shining dude 🫶🏼✨🎶
So happy to see you feeling good again. Your channel has always been a bright spot for me. Take care and let's go!
Love you, Rick!  Glad the surgery went well. John 3:16
Rick should create more educational videos, like the ones Bernstein did. Start with a show about blues, then move forward genre by genre. There is no better way to teach young people, then to do a two-part series about jazz; we need this generation to wake up to jazz. Thank God the surgery went well. Hallelujah!
Great to see you up and at it. All the best!
Rick bendiciones 🙏 y que te mejores de salud. Saludos desde Mexico 🙋🏻‍♂️
Glad you are doing well. Wishing you good health.
Hell ya! Great to hear!
The channel is always progressing, and that's a great thing.   It's alive!
Get well Rick, God bless you
Cmon rick , toughen up a bit bud, making musicians look soft.   Lol
Glad you’re up and about (I’m sure you’re resting between the “up” and “about”… I had a mitral valve repair 21 yrs ago and the technology and medical procedures today are so much more advanced: I was in rehab for a couple months. The worst part was sneezing - felt like a grenade went off in my chest.
So glad you're alive!!
It is amazing what medical science can do.  Too bad more people don't appreciate how research and practice has improved the outcome of patients.  Science is what conquers, not prayer.
"You're out and then you're BACK!!!!" So glad you are, Rick. 🤎
Rick, so glad you are back in the saddle and doing well - prayers to you buddy !!!
I love your insights and your cool format. So happy about your health news, rock on my Brother.
God bless you Rick! Hope you recover quickly and we look forward to many more videos!
Glad to hear you're doing well. I have something similar -- an enlarged aortic root -- that my cardiologist has been saying will need to be replaced for about 20 years. Some day it will. I guess the difference between mine and yours is mine shows no symptoms, until your aorta explodes and you die pretty much instantly. I'm not sure if that's better or worse.   Definitely take it easy for a while. Youtube will wait.
Glad you’re doing well Rick . We need you ! 👍🏼🎶🎸
GOD Bless you, so happy you are well and on the mend!!😉🙏
God be with you, Rick! Love your videos. Praying for you, man. John 3:16 ✝✝
We are so glad you are ok!  We have followed you for years now.. we shall follow you for many many more..peace, love, and respect.
Glad to hear you are doing well Rick.  You are an important contributor to our culture...and personally you have been important to me over the years.   This is good news for all of us.  In terms of content, as a Canadian, I'd love you to look at the Tragically Hip.  One in six Canadians own a Hip album.  Want more Canadian fans? It's the key to the city!  I want to know your thoughts. Love ya Rick.
I´m so glad you’re fine! Greetings from Mexico City.
Rick, I had no idea and I am so glad you are doing so well!  You always look the picture of health, so who would guess?  Best wishes for a complete recovery.  As a veteran of way too many kidney surgeries the past 4 years, I know the value of a good surgeon.  Blessings on your medical team and your family.  I’m sure your wife and kids are quite relieved.  Look forward to new videos.  👍
Your making me tear up.  Hang in there brother.
Great to see you back on the mend so quickly. Thank you for everything you do here! Take care!
I wish you a healthy recovery, Rick! God bless you.
Dude , Thank Goodness you’re doing ok.
Interviews are great! So much insight right from the source(s). Thank you!
Glad your doing well Rick, love the channel!
Ive been zipped open n shut 3 times, 2 aortic valve replacements and 1 mitral repair - long story, they usually are, but, hey, nothing to it!!!!. I have to say, you look pretty darn good for having gone thru this procedure. Whatever you do, do NOT over-exert yourself within those first 3mo's. That fancy tailoring stitch work can easily be undone. Otherwise, wishing you all the best.
do you like tame impala? just wondering
Don't usually comment Rick, but I'm glad your procedure went well.
Rad, and glad you're healthy and still here. I had an issue at 57 with a blocked obtuse marginal one. It was an easy fix with a stint thru the groin all the way up robotically and in. Took less than 5 minutes. Changed my diet and exercise as much as possible.  My heart arteries were in beautiful shape except for the that one little spot. A widow Maker. Doc said it looked like cholesterol blockage with a bit of hypertension. Eat clean food, Stay healthy everyone.
Great news mr.B and many blessings in coming years.  In response to your asking about future content, there is one song with guitar parts I can't get get a handle on...Payback by James Brown.
I am happy you are getting better and that you will be around to continue doing what you do.  I think it is wonderful you shared a personal tribulation such as getting your heart repaired.  People need to know these kinds of things are normal and people at every level in life encounter them.  Continue your recovery and listen to some '60s and '70s hits before the music went downhill.
Good energy from Miami, master!
Open heart surgery??? Dude!  So glad you're doing so well!  You rock.  Thank goodness your back.
Glad you’re back and ready to rock Rick.  All the best !
Great to know you’re well. Greetings from Mexico
Take all the time you need. There is no channel without you.  Personally, I like the interviews because I normally enjoy the stories that come with them. Take care, sir!
Rick, love you brother!!
You are a kid!  Time to react to Angelina Jordan and tell us what you think!  Won Norway’s Got Talent as a 7 year old jazz singer.  She’s 18 now and singing Tony Gad tunes!  Her fans are mostly seniors… lol… and she allegedly helps people heal.😊
♥♥
Glad you're okay. Keep playing and making videos maestro!
Speedy recovery and glad things went well Rick!
Love you Rick Beato!  Wow!  Very happy to hear you survived your operation!  My husband will be going in for a heart valve replacement soon.  It’s scary but what a blessing that they can do these procedures!  So glad you’re back and hope you keep getting stronger. 🩷
Wow, that’s great, Rick. I had the valve repair surgery (I was scheduled for a pig valve if they weren’t able to repair it.) 18 years ago in Rochester at Rochester General which (at least at the time) was associated with the Cleveland Clinic.
Good to see you healthy again steve.
Aguante Rick Carajo! Alto crack
Rick, you are a National Treasure ! I live “Downunder in Australia and it is a highlight to watch you interview some of the Great international musicians. It’s a pleasure to listen to you….you are, articulate, polite, informed and wise…..not to mention, a ‘top gun’ guitar player ! So glad you are in good health and look forward to many more years of you interviewing. Cheers.
Great to see you up and around so soon.  Hope your road to a full recovery is short and smooth.
Cleveland rocks Rick
Glad to hear you're recovering well. God bless.
I didn't know, but when I seen this thumbnail i thought, what?? No! Clicked it immediately. And am stoked to know that you're OK mate. Yes, I'm an Aussie and I'm sure I speak for all of us when I give all the best vibes I can and wish you a speedy recovery and l@@k forward to your next video. ROCK ON !!
Glad you're recovering. I worked in icu  in texas and saw many cabgs  bypass grafting patients, amazing too how valves are replaced these days.
Best place you could go for sure good to see you up and about
Closer To The Heart.
happy for you...appreciate your honesty re: health
Rick, you look great. Happy to know the surgery went well. The view is so much better on this side of the grass. Always remeber what Shane Falco said, "Pain heals. Chicks dig scars. Glory lasts forever". Be well and enjoy life
Praying for your full and  speedy post surgery recovery.
Hope you live another 62 years more! There’s not enough information for musicians on what they should be doing if they recorded bunch of tracks and then what? who to contact? or do you need to advertise on all social medias to get attention from labels?  i believe there could be whole channel dedicated to just educating young musicians so they can analyse theirs options and being more motivated!!!
Try the Headrush Core during your recovery Rick. Its' more fun than a barrel of monkeys. All the best, you rock.
So glad you're ok!  Thank God!
At 66, I am watching you and thinking "there but for the grace of...". I'm very glad to hear you have come through the procedure so well. I wish you many more happy and healthy years of providing us with such informative and entertaining music related content. One of my greatest musical influences is John Kay. He has retired from performing, but he is articulate and thoughtful and does great interviews. I'd love to see the two of you breaking down his legacy and work, especially the years around 1970-73. Steppenwolf produced two of the most beautiful and perfected rock albums ever with "7" and "For Ladies Only". Kay then left the band and made the solo album "Forgotten Songs And Unsung Heroes". At the time it totally spun me with the direction he chose, but looking back 50 years later I understand so much better what he explained in the liner notes about it being an acknowledgment of his roots. Anyway, he is reaching an age himself where such an opportunity may not be there for many more years, and you being the student of music and it's history that you are would be the perfect person to explore the path and history of a voice of the times that made him a star. I'm just sayin'...   Be well and happy Rick!
Many prayers Rick.  Glad you’re ok.
Glad you are healing up! As far as future content I’d love more what makes this song great! That what brought me to your channel. That plus your awesome interviews and this makes a perfect channel. Rest up Rick! Can’t wait for the future of the channel!!
I am so glad your okay.
Rick - I had mitral valve surgery 12 1/2 years ago, I was proactive about it which I have never done in my life. Because I did that, I was able to have an angioplasty ring sown around the valve surface. I had it done “non invasive”, they cut under my right breast and spread my ribs open. I am on no meds…usually I procrastinate about everything. Hope your recovery continues to go well!
Very thankful you are doing so well.  Much love.
So glad you're doing well! I've really enjoyed your channel over the last three or more years. My favorite was your coverage of Martha Algrich (sorry, I may have spelled her name wrong). You sent me down the rabbit hole of her beautiful piano music. I just can't believe I had never heard of her!
You look Great, Rick! Had a very similar surgery just a few weeks ago, and yeah, everybody’s a bit different.  You’re doing awesome!
Glad everything's fine and dandy, Rick! Stay healthy! <3
So glad you’re doing well. All of your episodes are great. I really enjoyed the Jim Croce episode. What about a Todd Rundgren Hello it’s me. Maybe you already did? Such a great piece/chord progression and also more great 70s lyrics.
Wow that’s some serious surgery. Glad to see you in great spirits and good health!
Good luck dude. Luv u mean it!
Good Day & Good News.  My wife is a nurse and explained all this to me.   Thank You for the health update.  Be Well.
Best wishes and a speedy recovery Rick !
God Bless your fast recovery! Can’t wait for your next interview!
so glad your recovery is going great.
Thank God you made it buddy.  Love your channel.🎉
Rick so glad your ok. Im not a steady watcher but I do watch quite often. Really glad your ok.keep on playing and teaching. I appreciate it. BTW im 68 good health thank God.
Very glad that you are doing well. All the best.
Glad you're doing well Rick, love the channel.
They couldn’t do it robotically because your heart is too big Rick 😉. Thank you for everything you do.
Best of good health to you Rick.
Blessings!!!
Heal up Rick - really really love what you do - and, who you are.  Thank you for your presence. Love yourself, and what I mean is simply be kind to yourself and do heal up well. Looking forward to years of more videos from you Rick. You’re the best!
Glad you are doing well 🎉.   Take it easy ❤.
Great to hear your story!
❤ project for the next 12 months: compose a song in collaboration with your followers! Multicultural! Stay safe!
Rick, I had no idea, but I am glad things went so well...The world is better with you in it. God bless you.
God Bless you Rick, speedy recovery 🙏🍻🥰
Glad you’re feeling better!
So glad to hear your all fixed up!  Love your channel!
Glad you're OK.  Despite some fledgling attempts I would not call myself a musician of any sort, but I always enjoy your content!
I'm so glad you're doing well Rick.  Keep taking good care of yourself !!  We love you !
Okay, call me not curious🤣🤣... jk, take 'er easy man and glad to hear it went well!  btw, how do you know what's over 10 lbs? 🤣
Welcome to the Zipper club! Marc did my valve 12 years ago. I was 53. I am still excellent at 66. The Clinic is a wonderful place.
Rick, I’m so glad you are doing well… God Bless you and keep you healthy. Don’t stop playing your guitar!
Rick, you are a light in the world, so glad you are doing well.  What a relief to the music community and the you tube community who loves you.
Get well, brother.
Wow, Rick, I am so glad you are OK.
please stay  healthy and  do way more interviews
I’m glad you got that done. The heart isn’t something you want to MAFO about. Also the thought of open heart surgery terrifies me!
Take care Rick, glad it all went great!!🎉
Glad your on the mend...careful handling those 10 lb LPs
Best Wishes Rick, glad your ok
Hey Rick! You had a major surgery. My wife does those robotic surgeries. GET LOTS OF REST. You look tired my friend. Get rest! Cheers!  Rudy
Excellent!  Happy for you. 🥰
So glad you're healing!
glad to hear things went well with the surgery, best to you
So Happy for your good health Rick! I love the way you address music.
You look great! ❣️🎶❣️
Great to hear you've got that behind you, and that you're doing well. Take care, my friend, you've got many interviews ahead. We love your videos! ♥
I'm so happy you're well. ❤
Keep on truckin' Rick!
Glad you're feeling better! Don't worry about the channel, concern yourself about making a full and speedy recovery.
You are an inspiration for those who are facing cardiovascular surgery! Got Bless + Good health to you!
Happy to hear your surgery was a success! Stay healthy.  Love to see you do a full show on Gary Moore someday.
Glad your surgery went well.  Love your content as an amateur guitar player.  Amateur as in I've been playing since 1998 but not professionally.
Glad that you are back on the road to radiant health. Glad it’s all behind you!
Longtime subscriber, Rick. You’re a really good guy and a brilliant musician. Your contribution is appreciated by millions and will continue to impact the lives of more to come and more who may not even be born yet
I started having heart problems at 60. I use blood pressure medication daily and my heart and health seem great at 66 years of age. I never needed any surgery. If I did not have medications to take I think I might pass away however due to blood pressure problems. The 4 medications I take are all inexpensive to buy.
Glad to hear you're on the mend. And follow those orders about lifting excessive weight! Don't be in a hurry.
Best of luck with the recovery process Rick!
I've had three open heart surgeries (for aortic valve). I'm glad you got this done and are on the mend. My only advice - don't push the recovery. Take it slow. Once you've fully healed you'll be even better than before!
Id choose that over cancer
get well rick and I learn so much from you and your channel
Sending healing vibes your way Rick❤️
Hey Rick, my dad has open heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. 7 years later he rides 100 miles a week on his bike. If you have to have heart surgery, Cleveland Clinic is the place to do it.
Glad to hear you're doing fine.   10lb lift limit?  Guess you're stuck on a strat only no les paul diet for a bit.
Glad your okay Rick like you I had my Aorta Valve replaced at Kennestone Hospital in Marietta in 2018,  it amazing how you’re body heals so quickly!!! These doctors are guided by the hand of God, GOD BLESS You, You’re Friends & Family.
Rick been enjoying your channel for some time, you add to the world with your knowledge and your spirit, hang around for awhile yet please
Good to hear everything went smoothly. And yeah, you certainly don't look like you had open heart surgery just a week ago! :) I had quad-bypass nearly nine years ago, and I was a little slower than you are at this point. You're right, it's a little weird to think of the fact that you're basically "shut down" for a number of hours. Thank goodness the doctors know what they're doing! Now, follow your doctor's orders and take it easy for a while! :)
Thank you for all you do Rick. Take care.
Yay!❤
Get well soon.
You stop the metronome momentarily and then restart it at a different tempo. Great to see you again!
Ouuuyeaaaaahhhhh!!!!!! Come on!!!!
Love all the things you do! Glad you are on the mend!  Hope you keep interviewing the greats s loose many each year.  Take care, keep it going!
Glad you're doing well. Open heart surgery may be routine now but still a big deal! Please take care of your self. Any content you put will great I'm sure. Can't wait!
God bless Rick.
Glad to see you up and running my friend...onwards!
medical science (and the men and women who make it their lifes work) is something we should be thankful for!!  Glad you're ok Rick (and if people didn't know, they would NEVER have known you just had some pretty major surgery...)... (PS... When are going back to Andertons..?)
Modern medicine is incredible. Glad you're OK and recovering swiftly, Rick.
You look great man!! God bless and best wishes!!
Best wishes. I have thorasic aorta issues. Live in Atlanta.  Good for you going to the Cleveland Clinic. Great vascular docs in Atlanta, but the Cleveland Clinic is the place to go. Went there in April. You are in good hands.
Rick, I’m so glad you’re recovering well! My wife and I so enjoy watching your YouTube videos, as your passion and enthusiasm are absolutely contagious!!  You are a true gift to this world and wish you continued recovery and all the best in this world!!
Good to see you up and about Rick, glad to know you’re on the mend ❤️‍🩹
It is very good to be alive. When I had a similar experience, very similar. I was in essence kind of dead. After I woke up I automatically spoke out loud " I am alive".  Later on I wondered, did I see Hendrix or Jesus, somebody? I saw nothing except a black hole. Don't you dare die on us!!!! I look like Frankenstein tried to kill himself with an axe, but still grateful.
Best news I heard all day..
I’m happy for you I have to go one of these years too
Great news Rick!  We love you!!
Happy to hear you feel great Rick, amazing what these surgeons can do these days. Take it easy and get back to normal soon!  Can't wait for the next spectacular interview. You have had almost all Steely Dan contributors on, left are Denny Dias, Jeff Baxter.....and the man himself, Donald Fagen. Tough nut to crack, Donald, but.......
Glad you're in good hands and came through the surgery in great shape! How about an interview with Jason Vieaux? His Images of Matheny recording is phenomenal! Keep doing you!
Take care and ge well soon - I am with you! Greetings from Germany from the silver fox, David 😉🦊
Think sometimes I/we all of us music loving people take you for granted, I'm a Welsh woman living in Fuengirola,  Costa del sol, I'm similar age to you, anyway I'm so pleased this intervention has made you feel human again, you give so much to the music community at large , maybe it's time to focus on you . Wishing you all the best Rick. Lesley. K. Xx
RB. I love you, and pray for you, and will continue to send my victims to your channel for various & sundry. You are a gift, amigo. Take care of yourself!!!!!!
Just now seeing your video.  The Cleveland clinic is phenomenal!  They couldn’t help my dad….but he lived for a number of years after his appointments there.  Love your channel and so happy to see you’re looking great and recovering so well!  Much love to you!!
Take care, man.
So glad you're up and running Rick 🙌
Rock on Rick, rock on-
I'm pleased you're on the mend Rick, you're looking fit as a fiddle!
Get some rest. I hope you feel better soon
Thank GOD you're ok.
You're an amazing talent.  So glad you're doing well!
Hola Rick! Me alegro que todo haya salido bien. Sos una gran inspiración para mucha gente y muy valioso que hayas compartido tu experiencia. Te deseo lo mejor!!! Abrazo!!!
I‘m so glad it all went well! ☺️
Happy for you and appreciate your sharing your experience with us! You look great.
Glad it went well and you are back rocking again!!!
Wow, lots of comments!  As an Echo tech, I spend hours daily in OHS.  I operate the Transesophogeal probes to scan the heart during the surgery.  Your story is what most people experience.  When I started 35 years ago, things were different.   We live in an amazing world.  Even 50 years ago, the result would have been wildly less desirable.  You'll do great!   Love your channel...
Rick, you are a musical treasure and are loved/respected by millions of hoomons. We want you to be around for a LONG, LONG time!
I love your song breakdowns and especially your guitar solo breakdowns
Had an aorta valve replacement 4 years ago Im 77and doing well. Good luck
all the best for your health Rick!  more power to your channel!
Best wishes, Rick.
All the best for a full and speedy recovery.. you look great after your surgery!
Feel better, fortunately you were aware of the problem and kept on top of it.
I really like Martin Fischer's one song in 10 different styles videos. You could pick up some songs or pieces of them and show what you can or can't do with it musically. For example, you talked with Dominic Miller about what songs used the Shape of My Heart theme, or you analyzed with Tim Henson why his music works while he explained what he is trying to do. But on a song level. But i really do love the interviews, please keep them up from time to time.
Rick , glad everything worked out. Love you and your channel. Your neighbor Neal Tucker Georgia.
Nice to see you're fine now, welcome back !  Greetings from Rio!
Rick, so happy that you are feeling well.  Not being whole is the toughest thing, happy all has gone well.  I case you actually see this, I want to ask if you've ever had the idea to interview Steve Perry or any of the original journey guys.  I loved Journey growing up 1978-85.  BTW, Im your age, I think.  Best.
Welcome tô the OHS Club. Glad it went well.
❤❤❤❤❤ … So good to hear that your surgery went well … Bravo on a great one ! You’re the best Mr B  ! Here’s to more of your wonderful work ! 👏👏👏
Rick take care, best luck to you!
Glad you’re ok, good luck on a speedy recovery! ❤️‍🩹
Get well Rick.  Praying for your recovery.
Glad you're back!
Wishing you a speedy and full recovery. I’m sending you positive vibes!
Glad to hear all is well Rick. What an amazing time to be alive! All the music, the technology, the incredible medical feats. We're so lucky right now. All the best.
God bless you, Rick.
Glad you are OK Rick. My girlfriend is 67 and is currently undergoing heart tests for a similar condition. She won't know the prognosis until about mid-August, so we're keeping our fingers crossed.
Happy you are back healthy Rick ❤️‍🩹 We love you !
All the best with your recovery! Sending love from Scotland.❤
all the best Rick!!!
Glad you're well!
Make sure you do the rehab they offer Mate
I had an important operation too a year ago (60M here). It wasn't as intense as yours but it made me realize it's the people, family and the little things that matter. I recognized your look at the very end and was touched by it. Happy you made it through. One human being to another. Stay healthy. 🙂
Hope you feel better soon!  Sending prayers.
Rick, I wish you years & years of continued good health & happy times.   I've been appreciating your Youtube work for years now & look forward to many more. 💪😀👍
Glad to hear you are recovering!  I had mitral valve repair surgery last year but fortunately I was a candidate for a robotic procedure (aka, no zipper in my chest).  Thank goodness a guitar doesn't weigh more that 10 pounds, eh?
Thank you Rick for the update and so glad you’re doing well! Wish you a speedy recovery!
Hi Rick, I’m Dutch, so I had to look up what a mitral valve is. Now I know, and although we’ve never met, I do wish you all the best the best recovering and thatyou keep up interviewing great musicians, expressing your love for music and making fun video’s for a long time.
Happy to hear it went well, I'm always wary of surgery.
Rick, First of all, glad to see you up and about, 2nd Heal well, WE LOVE YOU and NEED YOU!  Your "scar: is a sign of bravery and masculity! 3rd, Take care of yourself for us, looking forward to see you back at it again! \m/
Great News.  Wishing you good health!
Rick - love your channel. Grateful for you and what you do - wishing you the best.  I love the "What makes this song great" videos - the interviews and the ones where you just sit around and chat. What you do is why I subscribed - love it. Keep it up my friend.
Great surgeon, and a much loved patient!!  Outstanding update.
Glad you are well...love watching your videos...how you break down the music...the history of the songs.
Please get better. I love you videos.
This is another example of how surgeons earn every dime the charge.  Any attempt by some desk-jockey bureaucrat to limit a surgeon's charges is nonsense, and could lead to limited and degraded surgery.
I wish you a full recovery, be safe. Grtz from NL
I live in Cleveland and we really do world-renowned doctors, especially in cardiology. Great news and best of luck to you!
I am so glad to hear everything went well Rick!  You are such a huge inspiration to me and I see you as an example of the pinnacle of musicianship and knowledge. You and some recent events in my life have inspired me to return to music school after almost 20 years to finish my degree in music which I wish I would have done sooner but shoulda woulda coulda right?!  I ready now and more excited than I can explain to finally be following my dreams and passion for music. Thank you for all you have given to us all the knowledge and wisdom that you have shared and again I’m so glad to see and hear that you’re doing so well.  Take care Rick
Rick, thank you for the update. You were in great hands at CCF. Prayers for ongoing good health. Love your videos so much. ❤
Glad you're ok, we love you Rick!
So happy to hear all is well Rick!  Looking forward to more of your awesome videos.  Take care buddy!
Rick glad you recovering, I’m a cardiologist musician friend of Aydın, Cleveland Clinic is one of the best for Cardiovascular Medical practice and brilliant research center too. Symptoms usually tells us the time for surgery, so it is in our guidelines. Take care and keep inspiring us. ❤👍👍
Rick, thanks so much for your story!  I'm also a heart patient for my aortic valve, which will need to be replaced "in a couple of years," according to my local cardiologist.  I've been hearing that for three years now and have the same reaction as you.  Too funny!  I visited the Cleveland Clinic two years ago and they are fantastic.  I'm heading back in September for another checkup and hope to hear, "a couple years" again.  Dr. Unai will be my surgeon and super happy about that.  Seriously, thank you for posting this video and saying that you feel great just one week after surgery.  Thanks for everything you do and hope you get better and better every day!
I'm so glad you are healthy and doing well!
Just so pleased you're looking and sounding as good as ever!  That was a pretty major intervention! My knowledge of music theory is woeful but I'm always impressed by your eloquent explanations  - but don't think I've ever heard you say 'major intervention'?!
Love and prayers are with you.
Glad you're ok. You look amazingly well considering its so soon after a major operation.  Best wishes for the future from your fans in the UK.  Always enjoy your  broadcasts.
God bless you recovery! Keep doing what your doing! Great work. My suggestion is a mix of interviews and songs breakdown
Stay well my friend.
Glad to see you up and about 👍👍
great to have you back healthy Rick! Would be nice to see some song break downs in the future 😊
Glad you are well our friend 🙏🙏💕💕
So pleased to see you looking well after this heart surgery! Take your time recovering fully. Thank you for al your work!
Glad you’re back and doing so well. My wife of 34 years had the same surgery but she didn’t survive it. but that’s another story. Count your blessings and keep on making those great videos.
Glad to hear you're doing well, Rick 🙂 All the best!
If 5 lbs is your limit be careful with your Les Pauls!  Wishing you a speedy recovery.
❤
Glad to hear you are doing well!!
Great news Rick and best wishes for a successful recovery. If you've got to adhere to a 10lb weight limit for a few weeks, then I guess the Gibson Les Paul's will have to remain in the rack! Still there are better choices available!!  😉 Cheers, Ky
Stay well, Rick !
Glad you are doing ok, Rick.   It's amazing what's becoming "routine" in cardiology anymore.   I'll be having a valve replacement myself soon.
Hi Rick, Glad you're doing great! Love your channel! Your contributions to musicians - and I mean at all levels - is a beautiful thing! Live long my friend! Thank you!
Wishing you all the best Rick….stay away from lifting those Mesa Boogies for a while. 😉
Wish you all the best. ✊
Glad you are doing well Rick and I hope you continue to have good health! I will never forget your touching tribute to my music hero, Gordon Lightfoot!
So glad you're OK Rick! Loved your channel since I discovered it a few months ago. Wish you the best!
Speedy recovery to the kid in the tracksuit!!No one else like you.
Glad things went well for you, and remember that chicks dig scars!
Glad it went smoothly and also so glad to hear it was not a surprise. Heal well!
Glad you're ok Rick! Hey just keep on keeping on. Interviews, song breakdowns, whatever. Just do whatever is exciting you and we'll all happily come along for the ride!
Wishing you well.
Thank you for sharing. I'm glad to hear that your surgery went well!
Welcome to the club Rick! Had a repair in 2018.
Hey Rick is absolutely fantastic to hear your recovering well and feeling good. Glad you can still play to whilst you continue to recover 🤘
Welcome back Rick.
Oh Fantastic news Rick. Glad your're doing so well! Love your channel
Good to hear you’re well Rick ❤
Get well soon. (*What makes a song great and *your exceptional highest quality interviews, please) ❤
I wish you lots of health and many good times ahead!
Good health to you. The interviews have been very very interesting.
Better not play any of your Les Pauls!  They can be over 10lbs.  Glad you are feeling well.  Good for you taking care of yourself.
Coraggio...sei un grande ❤
So glad you're doing well, and back to keep us entrained and on our musical toes...
All the best, Rick!!
You go, Rick! Incredibly grateful for your openness. All the best to you and your loved ones.
Dear Rick, wonderful to hear the procedure went well and you feel good! All the best and keep up your great work! <3
I think Gary Burton had a heart surgery after which he lost his perfect pitch( I hope you don’t have any negative side effects, wish you all good health!
Rick...you look great.
Bless your heart, literally and figuratively, Rick.  I am amazed at the technology and the ability of people to be up and moving so fast after the procedure. I’ve known five people in the last ten years who had open heart surgery and their reactions all ranged from “On death’s door for two weeks after” to “Did I have open heart surgery?” A week later.
All the best Rick!
Congrats on your speedy recovery & keep rockin' Rick!
Glad that you are doing well. Let’s make videos about the bands that people don’t heard of or they are so good to not to be seen.  For example “Camel” which I believe you never talked about them before. 👍🏻🙏🏻🎸
Glad you are on the mend. I know nothing about music- cant read it, can't play it. Love your channel despite my lack of aptitude
Congratulations on your successful surgery!😊
I am glad you are doing well and making a quick recovery. Thank God who gives us  life and breath in our lungs.
Glad you're doing better, you couldn't have come to a better place. Hope you got to see some of our great sights here in Cleveland.
Get well bro
Very happy for you. Thanks for sharing. I'm 55 this year and no health issues to speak of, but these sorts of things I keep an eye on. Thank you and may God bless your healing process.
Very glad you are back and healthy!!!
Cleveland Clinic saved my life, Dr Glen Stevens treated me for 22 years and I wouldn’t be here without him, you picked a great place to have surgery and I hope your recovery continues to go well
Greetings, fantastic to know that you are well.
I was completely shocked when I saw the video and am so happy that you are well again. I wish you all the best, good health and keep up the good work. Best wishes from Germany
Nurse here.  Guitarist here.  Rick fan here. May you live 50 more years!!
Woah, I hope you are okay.  Believe in Jesus before it’s too late, any of us could die any day
Truly a wonderful outcome for you, Rick. Imagine the lives our parents could have enjoyed had medical science and medical technology advanced for them the way it has for our current generations.  Hoping that you and your family enjoy the balance of your summer together!
i'm glad you are ok , and i whish you well . keep up the god worke
Avoid the heavy Les Pauls for a while, and get well soon!
Great to hear everything went well with your surgery. I hope your recovery goes well. I had thyroid surgery myself recently and was also told not to lift anything more than ten pounds for a month afterwards too. As someone with ADD the hardest part of my recovery was keeping that in mind from minute to minute. I would make a habit of looking at my stitches every morning to remind myself of my temporary limitations, and it eventually all worked out. Take care, Rick.
❤
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Open heart patient here (23 years ago).  Glad I did it.....tech and care is light years further today...glad you had it done.   Cleveland Clinic is top notch....we collaborate with  them in the cancer realm here at our facility.
Nothing over ten pounds in the near future? So your old LP’s are likely off the table for a bit, lol. 😉😂 Glad everything went well. We love you!
Hope YOU'RE doing well, Rick!
Lookin good 😎
Glad to hear you are doing well and the that the surgery went well. I will keep you in my prayers.
All the best ❤🙏🏼
great to hear that all seems to going well with your health keep on going in what you are doing and take care.
Nice update, Rick.  Great to hear it went so well!
Your viewership age is incredibly vast. You have brought so much to do many. Bringing the personalities of your guests to life for us to know and understand has been a great gift. I hope your recovery is going well.
Glad you’re doing better, Rick!
Glad you're healthy and feeling good, Rick!
Well I've had my share of health issues. I hope you're ok. I feel that we don't know what's going to happen,so I makes sense to make our peace with God to be ready whenever the end comes. I don't know if you know much about the scriptures,but I try to tell people to read the new testament to start and try to implement it into our lives,
Glad you’ve well! You make my life better!
God bless you, Rick. Glad everything went well. Love your podcasts!
Rick, great news. Just understand that after a few days weeks the high you're feeling will dip. It's natural, enjoy your chanel.
What a drag it is, getting old Be well
If you can get past the crippling copyright claims, I’d love to see more what makes this song great videos. Also, an interview with Clapton, Jerry Cantrell, Eddie Vedder, Brent Smith, McCartney, Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, or Gilmour would be cool 😂
Good to see your well, love you content. All best
Only 10 lb limit - so no old Les Pauls, stick SGs? Haha! From one 'old guy' to another - Keep playing Rick!
Rick we need you here with us, I'm glad you're okay
I'm happy to hear that everything went smooth! Keep on producing videos about good music!
Hello Rick. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Thank you for your videos.
Glad you're doing well!
I AM VERY HAPPY FOR YOU & YOUR FAMILY!! LOVE YOUR CHANNEL & ALL THE WORK YOU PUT INTO IT. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESOURCES
Glad you are healing up, Rick. I love your channel!!
Thank you, Rick, for the update, I wish you all the best!
Get better Rick . Take it easy and aim for 100 👍
Can you help me move this weekend?
I don’t think heart problems have anything to do with getting tired in the afternoons at the same time everyday.  Hormone imbalances are at the root of that.
Interviews with the older rockers about the details of their music is important. Future generations will appreciate them, we also love them.
So good to hear your on the mend and doing well Rick! Keep on keeping on and rock on brother! 👍🏼
Glad u feel better!! ❤
Wow take it easy man get well soon 😊
Glad you’re healthy my man.
Best wishes friend...Take care.
God bless you, Rick.  I'm so happy you had a successful procedure.  You are a treasure to all of us and I look forward to many years of you sharing your passion and expertise with the world.
Cleveland Clinic wrote the book on heart surgery.  One of the best YouTubers on music went to the best heart hospital.
Great to hear that your surgery was a success!  I’m very happy for you!!
Great news!  All the best!  Godspeed!
Get well soon Rick. Love Copenhagen Denmark
My brother had a massive heart attack at 37, just as his life was getting back on track. His heart was damaged beyond what could be survived. He was kept alive with an LVAD, basically a pump doing the work of the left ventricle, which in his case is considered end stage treatment, and immediately put on the transplant list. About six weeks later, through a HUGE blessing to our family, but a tragedy to the family of an 18 year old man riding a motorcycle over 1000 miles away, he received a heart transplant. Within months of the transplant he was back at work full time, he was attacking his interests with a reinvigorated energy and joy, and he began to work to rebuild his broken relationships with his children. He lived another 18 years with that young heart in his chest. He didn't live a perfect life, but he and two of his three children spent time with each other, got to know each other (honestly, good and bad), and had relationships that otherwise never would have happened. Sadly, my brother passed away of another heart attack just a few years ago, as his genetic makeup made him extremely susceptible to coronary plaques and blockages. I miss him terribly. I'm close with his son, whom I love very much, and I hope and pray that I will be able to reestablish a relationship with each of his beautiful daughters before my time is at an end. Not sure why I'm writing this, but wishing you the best of health and prosperity in the years to come! God bless and take care.
NO HEAVY LIFTING. Im sure they told ya ... I have mitral valve prolapse as well.
Great news. They are a fantastically capable unit.
My sister in law had the same thing, Rick, she had to have a valve replaced. So happy you are up and around.  I love your channel when you interview producers and mixers from iconic albums (I'm exactly your age,) that Michael McDonald interview when he played the electric piano and sang at the end brought tears to my eyes and was one of the most touching things I have ever seen on YouTube.  That's the magic of your channel.  God Bless You, Rick! Keep on rocking!
I got that same scar. And I tell ya, when it gets itchy. Boy does it get itchy. Even almost 3 years later. It still feels weird.
Get completely better soonest, from this 66 yr old! Take care.
Glad you are better, old friend. Yes I can say that since it's been 50 years or so. Follow the doctor's orders and get better.
Rick you’re doing Great! as a HEART Patient myself we just have to PACE ourselves and Get Right With GOD🙂
Wishing you a full and speedy recovery, Rick.  Keep on keepin’ on! 🙏
SO STOKED YOU'RE OK RICK...GOD SPEED TO A FULL RECOVERY. WE NEED U BUDDY...TY FOR ENRICHING OUR MUSIC LIVES....
Glad you're doing good!!
I'm glad your surgery was successful. Best wishes on your continued recovery!
Prayers for your continued healing and restoration.
We love you, Rick. This helped me in a way that words cannot describe. Be well!
Thank you Cleveland!   Best wishes for a speedy recovery Rick.
Thank you Rick for everything that you have done on youtube. I wish you a great recovery.
Glad yout feeling better!
So glad to hear that everything came out ok and you are doing well!!
Our time and our health are two most pewcious things we have in our lives.
Glad you’re doing great. Stay healthy and keep jammin’.
You’re such a great personality, so natural, so humble! I wish you all the best and good health for the future…. Greetings from Switzerland … we love you
Inter iew chris lord alge again
Great to see you back, Rick!  Wishing you nothing but the best!
Rock'n'roll 🤟
Great to see you in high spirits.... wishing you a speedy recovery 🤲
Glad you are doing okay.  Gotta take care of ourselves.
Dear Rick, I got a new hip in December and had a pretty nightmare-ish recovery. I'm 64 and I had similar thoughts... Anyway: The most important thing is that you are well! I've been enjoying all your content - so just keep on doing what is fun for you... When you're in Germany again, it would be an honor to shake your hand...all the best from me to you!
looking good man. I will continue to pray. You may feel weird for awhile... but you will recover
thank god that it went well! Love your channel, always great!! Still waiting for you to bring on Mr Mark Knopfler! :D All the best to you!!
you're skinnier now...but looking very good!! Thank to your good vibes!!! Congrats and keep going!!!
What a relief! Did not expect this at all. Rock on!
Feel Better Rick!
I am happy that you will be healthier, now. Banzai!  ---OronOfMontreal
Great to hear all is well, Rick!!! I am very happy that you will continue to "take care" of the hearts and minds of all your subscribers who immensely LOVE, enjoy and cherish your work! Um abraço forte!!!! Jorge
Glad this was a success, you are a national treasure and are doing great work. Keep it up and keep the faith.
Godspeed Rick😊
Hey Rick, had a very similar surgery at 40 (different valve, also with the monster scar from a sternotomy). Glad you're feeling better! Lot of walking when you can.
Glad u r well.  Isn’t modern medicine wonderful. 🙏
Good to see you back, Rick.   I survived a heart attack when I was 40, fifteen years ago, while I was in the middle of presenting an advertising concept to a client. Fortunately, there was a hospital just 10 minutes away. Went through an angioplasty procedure, got a stent, and have been moving around, living a normal life (minus the 40 cigarettes a day) since.  But like all addictions, the cigarettes got replaced by a few other things - your channel being one of them. While I'm not a serious guitar player, you are fun to listen to - all the info, the music theory, your opinions, your rants, the interviews. I look forward to them all.  Keep them coming.  Following from India
Get well Rick!
Sending love and prayers.  I'm so glad to hear your voice on here. I'm just thinking. "Well get *stuff* fixed while you're young enough to tolerate the procedure." PS I'm 69l.  🎉 I love Cleveland, too. I'm only one hour away.
Very good luck that you had a great medical team taking care of you. And congratulations to you for being someone who monitored their condition and took advice from doctors. Not many males over 40 do that. Well done Rick, enjoy good health.🎉🎉🎉
I just like you to do what you been doing for as long as I have followed the channel. Love your content. Beast regards from Denmark
I think I speak for everyone in these comments when I say that we are so unbelievably grateful for you and your videos and your contribution to music at large has meant the world to us!!  Can’t wait for more!!!
Just curious why you went to Cleveland instead of in Atlanta? Did your local cardiologist not recommend anyone in Atlanta?
That's your problem, Sensei Rick: too much heart. May I respectfully encourage you to calorie-count your intake of Metallica, Black Sabbath, AC/DC etc. while you're recovering, and try to stick to a light and breezy diet of cardiovascularly-complementary fare a la J.J. Cale, Susan Tedeschi and Tim Buckley? Seriously though, best wishes for a speedy return to full health.
good to hear! glad you're back home and doing well, Rick!
You're just an amazing storyteller, Rick!  I watch this channel for that!
You're just an amazing storyteller, Rick!  I watch this channel for that!
long live Rick's Beating heart.. <3
Hey Rick, I also went through a similar operation 5 weeks ago. Sternotomy pain is slowly easing! Was delighted to find that I could still handle the guitar when I got out of the hospital!  Mine was a triple bypass!weird thing is I play a Friday residency in a Dublin pub and I found out the guy who does the Saturday residency had a triple bypass 3 weeks ago! What the hell is going on?😂😂
We are all so happy that everything went well. Way to go, Rick!
Live long, healthy and happy Rick!  Best wishes from Wales, UK
Rick, as a fellow sternotomy and valve surgery survivor, you look GREAT!  I felt so much better after my procedure 10 years ago, haven’t looked back.  Keep on rocking!
Dear Rick, be strong 'n at the top everyday, right? Greetings from Roma.
Rick, you asked for views on what videos to make in the coming year. I can’t tell you specific topics, all I can say is, the topics are almost irrelevant. What makes any video compelling to watch is knowing the presenter loves what they are talking about. In the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance after much thought he concludes quality is love. Just like we all know a great song when we hear it, it is all the love that has been poured into making it that makes it great. So make the videos you enjoy making and as long as you love making them, that will convey itself to your audience. Keep up the great work. Also just to say your recent two part video on the state of the music industry and why it has ended up where it is is the best summary I have ever seen. Totally agree with you. Don’t listen to the naysayers and their reaction videos. Most of them don’t even correctly understand what you were saying, and certainly don't present well-reasoned alternatives.
Glad to hear you’re out of hospital Rick and feeling so much better. As others have said, it’s not just your great musical knowledge that you share so freely with us but your own personality that we love. Keep up the good work my friend 🙏
I got you in my prayers! 🙏 Keep giving us the videos you do!
Glad the surgery went well.
GOOD FOR YOU RICK.
GLAD you're on the mend Rick!
Prompt rétablissement mon cher Rick ❤
Glad to hear that you are surviving. Your stuff has helped me understand the music I've been making as a vocalist all these years. Since I'm older than you, I'll leave you with these words: get well, young man, your best years are ahead of you.
Rick. Be well and strong. Keep doing your thing. The music community and the whole world is a better place because you are with us.
*I wish you the best of health! Please, Rick, give Lenny Kravitz a call. It would be a great thing to do!*
rock on
Amazing medical procedures that couldn’t be done just a few decades ago. Great you’re healthy!!!!
🍀
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Glad surgery was successful. Hope your recovery is fast and complete. Love your channel, take care.
Coincidence! I had the same surgery on July 9. I'm 62 as well. Didn't have symptoms. Only found out I had a heart issue after going to an urgent care for a sinus infection earlier this year. I'm doing well. Glad you are also.
Wishing you a quick, healthy recovery Rick! ❤ Loads of music to come. 😊
God bless!
Rock on, Rick 🎉
Glad you are doing ok dude! Health happy and wise.
I wish u a speedy recovery 🙏
Cardiac surgery, nowadays, is a miracle of science, really. I know it by myself.
Science is amazing. Glad to see you're back and doing well.
God bless, Rick. I am glad you are OK. 60 more years to go.
🙏🙏🙏🤘🤘🤘
these are the things that always cause some profound reflections on whats really important. Anyway, I am very happy for your and wish you all the best Rick. For the channel, I love interviews but I'd love more a world tour, like you coming to Amsterdam for instance!
Rick I am glad that you are feeling better.  You are a national treasure.  Please keep being an inspiration.
Rick you’re an amazing man and a blessing to us all.  You must live many more years!
Rick: I am so glad that you are OK and getting better. So many of us love you.
It is crazy to think they stop your heart. Glad you're doing better.
Good to see ok!
Congratulations on the success of your procedure!
Please avoid picking up a T40!  Congrats on the fix!
Its quite humbling what they do, is still get a bit emotional when i talk about it , cheers Rick
Gell Well Soon..
good to see you upright so keep it that way ROCK ON RICK 🎸 and have a good day
So no playing seventies Gibsons?
So glad that you got the quality care that you needed and you look fabulous for a week later!  My suggestion for  a focus for the channel would be finding quality music that can inherit the mantle from the musicians of our generation that created music without autotuning, etc..  Which acts will be the new Beatles, Who, Allman Brothers, SRV, Genesis, etc..  Also,  could we get some new blues songs?  It seems like everyone regurgitates the same short list of songs.
Praying foryou  Rick Get well soon
Stay away from the heavier Les Pauls Rick….😂.  Glad it went great for you!
Glad you're well, Rick!
'Glad to hear the surgery went well. 'Wishing you continued success with your recovery.
Gotta get and stay healthy. I love the Interviews.
I had the same surgery 4.5 years ago, along with a triple bypass. It was a rebirth for me. All best wishes!
God Bless You Rick! Gods healing hands helped the surgeon heal and  Bless you so we can Rick Beato for years to come. God Bless You Always
Way to go Rick! I know that mitral valve feeling. Stay strong and keep plucking them strings
Happy your recovering well !
Glad to hear you're doing so well! Take care and continue appreciating this experience and moment in your life!
Hi Rick, so glad you are well and back at it. That was quite the procedure and thank God it went well. Wish you the best always. Love your content. Thank you and God bless.
You always struck me as a guy with a good heart :)  Hope you have a great recovery God bless
Great that you came through it well. Heavy stuff. Looking forward to more videos. I particularly like interviews with Rock Guitar Players and Classic Rock Legends.
Hey Rick, Best wishes from UK. Keep up the great work!
Great to hear you are doing so well Rick.  you and I are the same age and while I am generally in good health my doctor is keeping an eye on the same heart issue.  Glad to get your input.  As far as video input, never stop doing artist videos whenever you can get them.  They are incredibly insightful and you do a terrific job with them.  Everything else is just gravy...  Keep it up!
It's great that they fixed it Rick. I'm glad your back.
Hey, Rick.... I had mitral valve repair surgery at 49, almost 15 years ago.... still going strong! Glad it went well for you, looking forward to upcoming content when you're up to it... it did take me the full six weeks before I was ready to get back to gigging and working, but it was definitely worth having the surgery.  All the best!
Rick, as a member of The BeatoClub and as an Orthopaedic Surgeon (knowing the risks of this procedure) I am very greatful to receive all your lessons...you are the BEST!
Hi Rick, glad you are recovering well💪
Good luck on your continued recovery.   I really enjoy your videos.
Good to hear that everything went well
Who does the best music interviews ANYWHERE? And has the most amazing guests? Rick Beato of course. That is where you really stand apart from the crowd. Having coming of age in LA in the 70's, I was able to see Larry Carlton, Robbin Ford and so many others in the clubs. Your interviews take me back to a great era. Get well soon!
Rick, get well soon and take care man. Thanks.
Thats great to hear you're on the mend, love and light to you bud
Rick, We're so happy that everything went smooth. Your increased energy level will only add to the greatness that you've created with your channel. Much love from the Kollman and Parsons family.
Take care, take it slow so you can mend completely!! Looking forward to more of your videos in the future, Thank you for what you do Rick!!!
I always notice the music the staff is listening to as they put your out in the operating room. Did you notice? Or did you have any special music requests?
I hope you didn't have the jabs Rick. If you have, get on a health programme immediately.  Walk, walk and keep walking.
As a member of the "zipper club" since November 1982 (aortic valve replacement), I can commiserate with your convalescence.  Love your very informative and intelligent videos. Good luck and keep on rocking. ❤
If You ask me I'd love to see more song breakdowns. Why? Because You tell us what's great sbout this or that song and what should get more attention in a particilar song. That's why I came to Your chanel. Sińce your pump is fixed You can do mora awesome stuff right? :-)
Glad to hear that everything went well. I hope your recovery continues and, well, live long and prosper.
You are the portrait of grace under fire. It’s hard to beat the interviews with the artists.  You know all the right questions to ask. And with the artists of the 60s and 70s especially, time is not on our side. They aren’t getting any younger and they aren’t making any more of them.
Hey Rick, I'm so glad your surgery was a success. If you hadn't owned up to it, I'd never have guessed, as your liveliness and good humour remain the same as ever. Looking forward to seeing more great collaborations between & Mary, Rhett and others
A big hug all the way from Italy. I so much appreciate your videos, dearest Rick, and I hope that you will rehab quickly. Thank you so much for sharing. Like belonging to a great great Family.
Good for you, brother. Long may your flag wave.
So glad to know you´re fine man! God bless ya!
Thank God everything last week. Glad you're doing well.
Glad you're doing better Rick.Sending well wishes from Montreal!
This is great news and your outlook is so positive. Very happy for you, Rick!  Best wishes as you heal...
Good health 2u
Happy to hear you are recovering well!!!
Mental image of Rick going home and getting the weight of every guitar tagged and listed.
Glad you're okay Rick!
Hey Rick!! Glad to hear you’re doing great! God bless you and your work!
You look great! God bless you
Thank you for being you, Rick.
Take care Rick
Glad to see you in recovery and doing so well----as far as the future, the interviews you've done are unique, and reflective of the audience you've been able to attract.  When would we have been able to see Andy Summers break down the Police songs anywhere else, along with the other interviews?  Do what you see fit....but I think the interviews and behind-the-band views are compelling!
Live long and prosper dude. Would love some more in depth history of some great rock bands of the past 50 years. You’ve talked about the Beatles at length but perhaps you can do some 20-30min history of other bands and artists. Love your channel in any format 🎵🎹👍
Great, Rick! Now you and Al Di Meola have even more in common. Carry on.
Glad your ok Rick, I had open heart surgery when I was 22, now 60. It’s quite an experience. Like you said your out than your back and it’s over, it’s like time travel.
Happy to hear about your sucessful surgery! Our Cleveland Clinic is definitely one of the best!
No mention of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!!   Interesting!!
Really glad you are on the mend Rick. You're an institution we all love and want you to thrive for a long time to come.
Rick, so much of healing is about having the right attitude.  Your attitude is spot-on.  I know this because my 18-yo daughter had open-chest surgery earlier this year.  She handled it way better than her mother and I did, I can tell you that.  She is doing fantastic, and a lot of it, I think, is because of her positive attitude.  Will send up a prayer for you that you stay strong!  Love your videos.  As to your request for what to do this year, I think your criticism of contemporary music is really spot-on, and courageous.  Calling out sloppy songwriting is really a necessary salve for those of us out there who are real musicians and real artists.  I'd ask that you seek out some talented people who are doing it right, and present them to us.  That could be really fun for you.  Think of yourself as an A&R man at a AAA radio station, looking for the next Adele or something.  See if some of these people have chops.  That could be a lot of fun.  And not just pop music - jazz.  Think about John Batiste for example.  The guy writes pop songs and symphonies.  Pretty awesome.
Good on you mate - glad you are recovering. Love your videos.
Rick, welcome to the club. Been there, know what it's like. Best wishes from Central Italy. Continua a suonare e dacci ancora le tue analisi. Forza!!!
look after yourself Rick, take it easy, keep talking about current trends, what you are noticing. There was an interesting comment on the severe lack of bands in the charts, just solo individuals
Glad you're doing well, Rick!
Hi Rick, I just want to say that I love your channel and it's exactly the content that I crave.  I love the interviews, song breakdowns, theory, gear talk and all the other fun stuff you do.  I'm so glad you are ok with your heart procedure and that you feel great!
Hi Rick ! So happy to know you're well again, you'll now be healthy for many many years ! Luc
Hey Rick , watch your sodium, sugar and saturated fats intake. I’m glad you’re okay. Your interviews are amazing! Take care!
Thank God you are ok, may He take care of you now. Enjoy 😊
Rick, glad you are doing well. All the best. I am not a musician. Always wished I was. Even though I am not a musician I really enjoy your videos. That is in spite of the fact that much of what you say goes over my head. I am an old guy, 85. Was a teen during the start of Elvis’s era. I went to see him in 1955 in my home town of Fort Myers Fl. He was second or third billing. The star was Faron Young. Love the blues. Especially the old guys. Saw John Lee Hooker when he was an old dude.  Get well.  RSB
I tried to comment yesterday but I couldn't.  Glad you are doing well..I have thought about the story of your uncle's Bass often when this came up...
Rick, so glad you're ok my friend... God bless
Wishing you ALL THE BEST!!!
Thanking Dr Gillanov for more Rick Beato.
Interesting - I’m 68 and have this and am monitored once a year - I’m just told nothing has changed and have even been part of research. At no point have I been told I might need surgery. I don’t have any symptoms. Interesting.
Get well soon!
We love you Rick, thanks for giving us an update and thanks for taking care and showing us all it is a manly thing to take care of your body and health. Happy for you and family brother
I am 63. For the last year or so they've been looking at my ascending aorta which is growing.. I may need surgery in the next year or two.. I just had a left lung diaphragm plication last year. the diaphragm was paralyzed..  Sucks getting old. Glad you got thru yours... Rock on...
Glad you're back and raring to go! Look forward to new stuff from the new and improved Rick!
Take care of yourself, Rick!
Love Rick !!
I WISH YOU WELL PAL! PLEASE KEEP IT GOING! I have some issues as well! Greg
I am really glad to hear you are recovering very well form your operation Rick. Thank you for all your brilliant videos and great respect to all doctors, nurses and medical staff ❤
You're awesome, Rick! Glad you're well!
Hi Rick! I'm really happy it all went well! Wish you all the best
Congratulations to your surgical team for doing such a great job. You are an inspiration for all creatives.
All the best. I hope you get better soon! Bill Mitchell
Such great news. Many thanks to all who pitched in . Take care of yourself. The music world needs you. Slange..
Congratulations Rick. Long live!
Rick, today is the 4 year anniversary of my heart transplant. The most amazing gift there is. It was during my recovery that I became aware of your channel. I am the former owner of Sound Construction and Supply, inc. and I have been on both sides of the glass for over 40 years. I am grateful for all the great talent you have brought to your channel. A very speedy recovery to you. The best is yet to come.
glad to hear to are doing well.
I’m glad to hear you are doing well!  I love the song breakdowns, so I’ll always take more of those.
Hello! I had heart surgery 6 years ago when I was 52. Now I'm fairly well, I have a pacemaker, but I'm alive and making music. Get well soon!
Be well, Rick!
Get well us muso look out for each other's take it easy bro.
Rick, I have a close friend who has the same problem and is waiting to go to CC. I sent him your video.  Thanks for posting.
It's great to see you! Welcome to the club. Aortic valve replacement 2008
Rick's Heart Beato continues
God Bless you Rick!! My Grandmother would NOT get this fixed… it was the death of her. Could have been taken care of and prolonged her life. Thank God you also do public service announcements too!! You look great and sound great….. since you have this new found energy…… let’s do a show with all the top 10 singles that made it on airplay using the almighty “D” chord…. Think summer of 69…. You will be surprised that even in country…. That first position “D” chord is a bit making selection because it is so damn happy and sounds amazing through a loud Marshall…… please consider this list of hits with the almighty “D”
Thank you for sharing this important update. It was good to understand your journey which led up to surgery. More importantly, this retrospective of your experience, one week post op, was amazing. You look like it’s just another day of filming!   Get well slowly. Remember, the turtle wins the race. Just keep racing, like the turtle!
Awesome to see ya back in the saddle Rick. All good cars need a service🎉
Glad you're back on your feet! For the channel...would be awesome to do a combination of the two: song breakdowns with some of the artists who have performed them.
Hey Rick, So glad you did so well with this surgery.  I work as a Surgical Nurse, Scrub and I have also watched and enjoyed all that you offer on your channel since you started it.   Thanks for all that you give man !  My best to you !
Welcome Back, Rick Pacino
Take care and all the best from Poland
Wishing you much health and a speedy recovery and thank you for all that you do. 🙏🏼✌🏻♥️
Happy to hear it all turned out so well for you Rick. Keep doing what you do, love your videos and interviews!
Any near death experiences??
Hay Rick, I wish you all the best.
glad to hear everything is going well. You are making a lot of people deeply understand why we love what we love. In other words, you are much needed. Lots of love from Sweden, Rick!
get well old friend
Hang in there Rick, best subscribe I ever did. 🎵
Happy you’re better Rick! Best wishes!
Looking good Rick. All the best to you matey.
Get well and stay well Rick. Best wishes A
Dear Rick, glad to hear you're feeling very well. I myself had open heart surgery for a few bypasses a dozen years ago. I feel great since and had no more problems, no restrictions of any kind. The only thing that changed is how I'm grateful for all I have... Including the opportunity to be regularly inspired and motivated by your videos. KEEP the GOOD WORK!
Don't worry about making fewer videos. I'd rather you made fewer videos and feel great about being alive. And being ill or down with something will always prompt taking time out from a schedule to deal properly with it, just like stress requires a slower pace.
Congratulations + hope you stay healthy! Don't go Steve Albini mode on us!
God bless you Rick Beato, we love your work, specially interview of your! When Juya Wang?! U can do it!!! 😁
As someone who had a health scare over the last few years (thankfully, surgery wasn't required and I was able to reverse the condition), I can empathize to some degree. Glad you are alright!  Anyway, 3:11 Here's a suggestion if you want to try out new content. Album reviews/song reactions and artist interviews specifically for independent/local bands. Like a dedicated weekly episode that highlights  a different non-rockstar level band. Could be a way for you to find new bands, and to introduce your audience to new bands and help get struggling artists some much needed exposure.
Glad to see you doing well. God bless you.
So glad to hear that everything went well!! Greetings from Öland (south east coast of Sweden) Richard
I wish you a speedy recovery. The Mike Mills interview was brilliant.
I send you tons of kisses from France !
Glad to hear it all went well. Get well soon.
Geez. I'm thankful you're still with us.
Get well soon Rick. Take care of yourself.
Get better soon Rick.  The world is a much better place with you in it😊
Nice to hear that you are doing well .Keep on rockin Rick
Same age as me Rick. Keep on keeping on.
British blues legend John Mayall, the one responsible for launching the careers of Eric Clapton, much of the original Fleetwood Mac lineup (including the namesake rhythm section) and Mick Taylor, passed away recently.
Rick, glad to hear the surgery went well and you feel great again. Best wishes from the other side of the pond.
May you have a complete recovery! Penfield High School class of '75!

So good to hear you’re well again. Stay healthy and spam all of us with your awesome music analyses. Greetings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱
Mix it up. Variety is spice.
Sorry to hear you've been unwell Rick. Delighted you're on the mend my friend. Keep doing what you do - it's terrific!
We r happy u r well. Wishing a quick recovery.  One ask; John Paul Jones, Brandon Benson interview?
To all bros hitting the high end of their 50’s: it’s a little bit of the death zone. Look at guys keeling over while shoveling snow, for example. Keep a low profile and do lots of medical checks! Nature doesn’t like old men…
Take care like you do. You make all musics dialog lovely! Wishing you the best health.
Song breakdowns.
Hey dear maestro, I wish you all best!!! ❤
Good as new! Glad to hear it, Rick.

Glad your back! Prayers going out!
Glad you're feeling better. 👍 stay strong.
I’m so happy to hear that you are well!  Thank you for being with us a little longer! Rock on my friend. 🤘🎸😉
Rick, I wish you all the best, I'm happy to see you back. Keep explaining what music makes you vibe and what don't, not for old nostalgic dudes, but because art and beauty are so much needed for everyone's life and for the world. If you want to focus on less things, I'd say that your interviews condensate the best of all your incredible skills and contribute the most to disseminate high quality content upon popular music. These interviews are contributing to music culture history, for sure. Thank you so much for what you give.
So pleased everything has worked out for you successfully, Rick.
Blessings, we're sending you all our love! Thank God for incredible doctors and great patiens! 🙏🙏🙏
Glad you’re doing well. Love your content. I really love the interviews.
Delighted to see you up and about and looking so good. Love from London 😄

Fantastic!... Glad it all went well for you, Rick!... Looking forward to more enjoyable videos...👍👌🙂
Glad you’re feeling better Rick , I’m only a very basic guitar player but I love your channel and bought some of your courses. You are definitely a force for good in this world. I wish you a long and happy life my friend .
I'm glad you are doing well. Hope you have a routine to keep your heart ticking.
So glad your surgery went so well. May you have a complete recovery. I just finished your Best 2 minutes in music video and it made my day. I have so much more Keith Jarrett I have to listen to starting with Spirits. I guess I shouldn't be surprised he plays the Sax so well.
Bless you stay well---- I love your channel even though I can't understand half of what you're saying 😊
I love your commitment to double denim. Awesome.
Rock on, brother!  Glad the surgery went well for you.
Glad your doing well Rick!

Everyone needs you. Very happy you are doing good. Thank you for some Sanity on a Sinking ship Captain,

So glad to hear you're through this and doing ok. Keep going :-)  I had a friend who had this op and he complained of weight gain afterwards - he was using his food more effectively because his heart was operating at higher efficiency !
So great to see you on the mend. You and your channel are so educational and inspiring. Thank you for everything you do.
So glad you are good, and all has gone well.
Hope there's 60 more years of your videos ahead of us! Take good care!
New lease on life Rick my man

Glad you are doing well Rick!
Glad to know you are well… Wish you a full and speedy recovery 🙏
hope you're back to your best soon Rick....you're amazing ...love your videos 👏👏👏
I had the same op at 42, 10 yrs ago exact same mitral valve repair, but mine was after endocarditis 3 months earlier. I had the Op at Bristol heart institute, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol UK. Professor Ascioni, he said after he went in twice to repair it, took 4.5 hrs instead of 2.5. I've wondered since why he took two go's to repair? I was the youngest guy in the cardiac ward for 6 weeks when I had the infection - the stuff I witnessed there life and death profound! Coming round from the anaesthetic was like I'd just closed my eyes. I was told  you can develop a heart murmur from years of taking stimulants - speed!
Hello Rick take care of you, keep on truckin’.
I'm glad it went well, man!
Your a true gentleman and all round good bloke mate, keep up the quick recovery my friend
All the best to you Rick! ❤
Take it easy and no more shaking your fist at the clouds lol 😄😊
Rick,  I really enjoy your videos,  your talks about music from all facets and life stuff in general. I really like you.  I think you're a good person who really knows his stuff,  and you're human.  So many spectators lose sight of that. Most have this idea that popular,  known  people, celebrities, if you will, don't have health problems or issues. I consider you a bit of a celebrity in this whole web based cyber world, and I think it brings us all closer to know about your health. Thank you for sharing it with us,  man. I'm happy to hear that you're alright and bringing more of your knowledgeable content to people like me while I'm working 3rd shift in a freezer. It makes my downtime worthwhile and meaningful for my musical head space. ✌️
Great to see you up and well!
Hey Rick wishing all the best for a quick recovery. I'm in London,  about your age, you're a great inspiration. Best wishes, Steve
Do whatever you enjoy Rick for the channel, I'll follow it anyway. Breakdowns of songs would be nice but perhaps more metal songs? Perhaps another topic "What makes this song bad?" . You'll ahve an endless pool of songs then. 🤣🤣 Enjoy life to the fullest!
Glad to hear you’re feeling better - God Bless you Rick
"I had open heart surgery, it went well now i'm good, bye" is not something you hear every day.
Best wishes Rick, stay well.
Take good care of yourself. Glad you're recovering. We can't afford to lose you!
you should do a guitar storytime where you tell the story behind some of your guitars
Great to hear you're all good. From the comments it seems like sharing this story is helping a few other people as well.
That's great news Rick. I'm glad everything went well. I love your videos Rick and I wish you a speedy recovery. All the best from Australia mate!!!
Wishing you all the best for a full recovery Rick
So good to see you back up and about, Rick, looking very well. You are very much loved by so many! I bought one of your bundles in support and to celebrate you keeping going!! 🤩🤩❤
Wishing you many more years of playing the music you love and teaching us about the importance of GOOD music but most of all I wish you many more happy and healthy years with what's the most important thing in life,  your family.  All the best from Watford, the town that gave the world Elton John and Geri Halliwell. (Don't blame me though).😂
All The Best TooYou RocknRolla...Earth Soul Blues RocknRoll...

Good to know you’re not going anywhere soon ❤️from 🇿🇦

Best wishes for continued recovery.  On a less important note, looking forward to future vids although theyre normally wat above my paygrade ! 🤣😂
Get well super fast buddy...I dare you to play ''victim of love''/eagles... when you recover...no pressure..peace and love and mungbeans mate
Happy that you're ok and still with us. Give us another 62 years. God bless you.
You look amazing, especially considering you just had surgery!
Rick - Glad to see you „on track“. Great channel. All the best for you from Hamburg.
☯God Bless Rick☯Jobs a good one☯
i had double coronary heart surgery. it has taken me much time to realize i was basically dead on the table as they left a machine to breath and saturate my blood as my  silent heart was fixed. today i decide to talk to my cardiology at my next appointment if i am fit enough to donate my blood, plasma, platelets to help the next person that ends up on a surgery table...because, i am so glad to be alive...and i as so glad that you pulled thru with flying colors wishing your and yours the very best you know, at one time playing guitar was my only focus, after this operation i've realize its the little things beside donating blood, like a kind word, a pat on the back a smile and a hello these things are priceless.
Congrats Rick. How amazing, that we're able to benefit from these incredible surgical procedures. I had 2 hip replacements with spinal anaesthesia....a few hours of listening to my heart monitor, hammering, sawing, drilling. No music in the theatre either time. BORING!!!!!😂 HERE'S TO YOUR NEXT 62 years!🎉🍻(mine's a zero alcohol, I'm on meds for rhematoid arthritis).
Love you Rick! Keep on rocking in the free world!
Anybody who spends as much time as you do critiquing the current Top 10 - it's bound to be heart-breaking ;-)   Get well soon, Sir!
Really glad you're ok, Rick.
Congratulations 👍👍👍
I'm glad you're recovering well. ❤ I like the song breakdowns.
Great to hear such positive results.
Well done mate all the best
can't lift anything over 10 lbs, no les pauls for you!
Glad you’re on the mend.  I’m an RN at the CCF on the main campus - sad I missed you (needle in a haystack) but happy you left!
Hey dear Rick, I am glad you recovered exactly from the same mitral valve disruption I had two years ago + I also had two sails that were severly torn apart! I was playing too hard in life! I'm in recovery just to mention, for a couple 24hours. I am just glad you recovered sooo quickly! 🥰 THANK YOU SOOO MUCH for ALL you put into this awesome, inspiring, mind-blowing and wonderful channel. Just recently watched your video playing the song 'Seasons' with your kind singer friend and the news you both received when Chris Cornell took his life that mornin! I am more fortunate, because I have my 3rd life now (after surgery) and I am very grateful to acually be 'back on track' again and last week FINALLY - after another mental crises (my mind is slower than my body) - I have finally (it felt like months) been able to pick up the guitar again and DO WHAT I LOVE MOST! Cheers and ALL THE BEST for you and your family, 🙏michael
Glad you are on the mend and take care of yourself!
Love your interviews.
Get well soon.
Rick so glad you are recovering from your surgery, your channel is brilliant I am a 70 year old Brit not long taken up acoustic guitar your explanations on songs and playing styles are second to non, I particularly found your appreciation of the late Gordon Lightfoots song  ' If You Could Read My Mind " very intense, anyway Rick have a speedy recovery and stay safe
Glad you are doing well Rick. Wishing you well and many more videos in the future. Keep on keepin on.
Within 24 hours, over half a million people check in on your video just to see if you're okay.   May you keep doing what you're doing for the longest time Rick. Love your stuff. Hope you rest up and recover quick.
hello rick, im happy your feeling well keep doing what you love take care and all the best!
Best wishes and ❤ for you, Rick.   ❤️🎸🎵🎶🎼💝
Look after yourself Rick, you ain't goin' nowhere!!
Keep well Rick - good to hear your surgery was successful and you are feeling well now.
You rule, Rick! Glad to see you back. Keep up the great work, now with your renewed heart!
Glad you recovered so quickly. Looking forward to many more videos on your channel. Be well!
Rick, you look great ! So glad you're doing well.  God bless the clinic and its doctors! Stay well ! You're such a big part of my life, our lives !  Thank you !
Glad it all went well legend iv had myn done ,mechanical value
Take care, young Man. Good luck😊
God bless🖖🙏
I had open heart mitral valve repair 7 years ago. I was at 25% ejection fraction, now I’m about 45%. I am always fatigued. It’s good to hear that you are not. I am still able to work full time as an RN in the ED. I am grateful for my surgeon at University of Michigan! Go Blue!
Happy to hear that ! Stay safe. Thank you for your videos !
You sound great Rick!  Happy for you and your loved ones. It will be great to have you back when you are ready 🙏
2:11 Woooh noooo !!! Îm pretty shure your heart stopped beating evry single time you ´ve heard Al Di Meila, Barney Kessel, StoKenny Burel, Stochelo Roségerg...and so much others playing THE perfect note...THE perfect phrase... 😅 Best wishes.
Wishing you the best Rick, hope you're feeling better and better as the days go on ! Best wishes from the UK !
You’re looking great! So happy. Thank you for sharing, and helping us all keep our health up. 🤙🏽🎶
All the best to you Rick and your recovery. Thank you for all your amazing videos, knowledge, songs breakdowns, stories, and good vibes, feel like you are a family member to us. ❤
Glad to hear you are recovering Rick. I am only 45, and after my heart randomly stopped last year, I learned that I needed to get a pacemaker, which I did in January. My recovery was not as swift as yours, and I still don't like the stupid thing, but I am mostly used to it now.   As far as what I would like to see from your channel, I would like to see some videos about good new music. You have had a couple videos recently about how new music is not good, and I agree that there is a lot of bad music being made these days, especially now that people are starting to make music with AI. It makes me not very excited for the future, but maybe there is something good about the new technology as well, and I would like to explore that, and be proven wrong, that the height of music was in the 1970s.
All the best for your recovery
Thank you for sharing, Rick!  You are a gift to this planet.
Welcome back!  Can you do a focus this year on progressive rock, particularly from the 70s. I’m 64 and really tired of crappy contemporary “music.”
Just really glad to see you smiling and feeling good, Rick.  Take it slow, okay?  You give us a lot of joy with your videos and we appreciate you a whole bunch. 💐
It is so nice to hear that everything went smoothly. I wish you all the best and I wish all of us wathing your vidoes/material  to have you around for next decades :)
So glad that you are well and back to your regular routine. Best wishes and know that many people love you and what you do!❤
Now that you have been given a second chance, did you find Yah?
All the love to you and energy of the most powerful to have a life with great health. We all love you too fucking fucking much.
Wow! Rick so glad your on the mend, love your videos.
That's a tough thing to go through. So glad your surgery was successful and that you are doing well. Wishing the best health. Take care. You are the best!
Of course  you  had a heart issue my friend. You have such a big generous heart it needs a service every now again like a beloved classic car should. I wish you a speedy recovery. Rock on😊
God vibes and best wishes to health.
Speedy recovery sir ❤❤
Best wishes and a swift recovery from the island of music: Cuba
Rick… what you do is to explain and draw attention to all aspects of music is awesome. I was a teen in the ‘60s, now 75. I grew up loving the rock of the 70-90’s. But you share and dig into the old stuff. So glad you are feeling well and look forward to many more years of watching and listening to your channel. Be blessed.
I hope you keep healing, Rick. Your love for music always inspire us. Greetings from Bolivia.
I'm so happy you're doing well.
Hey Rick!!!Man, you are a lion!All the best with you!We love the work you do here!
Glad you're ok!
Long live Uncle Rick!
Glad you're feeling better and on the mend, Rick. As they say in Hebrew: Rufuah Shalemah
Glad you are well mate.   You are the best !
Terrific news buddy!
Thank you for sharing your story with us; so glad the surgery went well! Excited to see how this experience influences your work with the YouTube community following along with you on the channel this year.
The fact that you had such a short story to tell about the surgery is the absolute best possible situation. It sounds like it went as smoothly as one could hope, and I'm glad you're feeling better already!
Glad to hear your op was a success Rick and a big shout out to the surgeons who have given you a new lease on life. I'm mid 70's and have a similar prognosis with my Aortic valve, and like you the Cardiologist has been saying for some time that an op will be necessary one day. I know that I'm going to miss my afternoon siestas...
@starlightgrecording559 Rick Beato I Forgot To Add That's Good You Walk Nin Miles A Day and Did You Know That The More You Work out or Walking Your Heart Gets Larger and Healthier and Try to Eat Healthy is The Key  of Long Thealthy Life and I Started My Music Playing Music at the Age of 10 years Old*** That's the Way To Go Rick Beato and You Look Good For Having Open Heart Surgery !!!!
👋  Glad it went so well.
extremely happy for you. God bless you
Good to see you well Rick. Greetings from México.
Thanks for the reminder.  I have MVP and am supposed to get an ECG every few years or so.  They say I may need surgery one day on my mitral valve.  I've put off my doctor visits since pre-covid.  You reminded me that I'd better get back on top of it before something serious occurs.
Thanks for sharing your experience sir! Keep looking after your health!
Glad you're on the mend Rick. Stay well.
💖🙏💖 Blessings to you, Rick💖🙏💖
Rick, so thankful for the care you received and skill and brilliance of your cardiologist! As others have said, you are a gift to us in the music world and I'm really happy for you and for us as well since we will benefit from your passion for music with more amazing content! I'm glad you finally got it done and didn't wait another 3 to 5 years!!
All the best Rick. I started watching about 4 years ago, and was hooked by your what makes this song great videos. Everything you do is gold, but those are extra gold..
Rick, you have your glow back, man.  You're a real resource for all of us musicians...but you're honestly an an amazing ambassador for the arts.  Having had my own sternum cracked in 2010, I must say that you look fabulous, and it does me good to see you on the mend!   And as a native of Atlanta, I believe our city is a better creative community because you're not only as part of the scene, but you're a keen advocate, a visible force, and an inspiring creator.  We're lucky to have you, and here's to many more years of your passion finding fresh ears!
Hello Rick, what amazing timing! Just recently found out had congestive heart failure. 7 days so far in hospitals. Now I know gave even more things wrong . ..don't know yet what will happen,  may be open heart too. Thank You so much  for talking about such personal stuff personal
Love you man, and  love your channel heart surgery is a big deal, good to see that you made trough it!
Prayers are with you Rick. Grateful for you, and your OR team.
Take good care! Best from Sweden 👏👍🇸🇪🙏
Best wishes on your recovery Rick!
Get well soon!
So glad to hear everything went well. Your always interesting.
Be healthy my boy!!
Great news - sending you another bucket of appreciation from the UK
Best wishes for the next chapter. Keep up the good work and enjoy!!
Glad your surgery went well!. I really enjoy your channel, and you are a great musician! I hope you remain in good health for many more years!. Rock on!!
You look really trim and healthy. Glad it feels better.
So glad you are on the upswing!
You make the world and music better.  Keep on preaching to us and educating us.  So glad you are doing well.
I love your interviews, they're really great. The really high profile like each Police member but also other great musicians as well that I didn't know so much about but was just locked into the videos. And very pleased that you're feeling well after surgery!! Amazing.
Great to hear that the procedure went well and you are doing well and feel good. Kudos to the doctors, nurses, and staff for working to make you well again. They deserve more love than they get much of the time.
Really glad you are well. I love everything you do in this channel but personally I'd like more songs breakdowns. Take care, take it easy and keep being the way you are!
Best of good health and fortune to you, Rick.  So pleased to see and hear you are up to posting.  Be well.
Rick…glad you’re ok. Keep up the good work and…play on!
Amazing, had no idea. Happy that you are well.
Getting older brings health issues with it.  Happy you are doing so well!
Glad you're ok, Rick.  Happy healing. I enjoy your videos.
Glad you're healthy and everything went smoothly! Here's to many, many, many more years!
Great to see you are doing well.
Wow! Glad to hear you are feeling good Rick. I know you are not a gear channel, but I am most interested in how guitarists and recording engineers got the best, most historic sounds - in forensic detail. So we can steal their ideas (ha ha). Like say, how do those country/Nashville guys get those fantastic creamy broken up guitar sounds?
Glad your ok!
farewell Rick
Glad to hear you’re doing well.  Salute to many more years of great health!
I have mitral valve prolapse and I have been terrified of needing this surgery. But Rick, you have made me feel better. I’m not afraid anymore. Plus, I’m so happy I found your channel! I studied architecture and music at Cornell and was so excited to see you went to IC! You’re awesome!
Glad your doing ok bud👍
That's great news! All the best, Rick!
Hey Rick! Congratulations! So glad you're on the mend. I had an artificial pulmonary valve and the atrial septum repaired in 2016 at Duke. (I live in North Carolina.) Like your experience, there were no issues (up walking the next day; discharged on day 3. It's really remarkable what talented, skilled, accomplished folks can do, and I include you in that remark! I'm 69 and do any kind of activity I want. I play electric bass, love your channel, and like you love the Beatles! Look forward to many more video views! Blessings!
Sayin' a quick prayer for you, Rick!
Hang in there Rick!!! What you do here on YT is VERY SPECIAL!! ❤
Rick, I'm so happy you're doing so well. It's amazing. It's only been a week, and you look great! Love your channels. Loved the interview with Kip Winger on your second channel. What a talented man.
CLEVELAND CLINIC ? do you live here in Cleveland ?
Glad you're doing well God Bless Rick
Glad it went well for you!!
We will all be here to welcome you back if and when you are ready. Hope you are on the mend, love your videos. Rest up!!
God bless you are well Rick!
❤️
Glad you are doing better! Take care
Congrats! Wishing you all the best!
I AM GLAD YOUR DOING VERY GOOD. I TOO HAVE HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY. I CAN NOT BELIEVE YOU DOING THIS GOOD.
Open heart surgery has come such a long way. I’m glad you’re back on your feet and feeling great!
Rick: glad you got ahead of your heart issue
God bless you, Rick!
Get Well, Rick. The music world needs you.
Sure glad you’re doing well!!
gonna have to talk to my surgeon...I had open heart surgery and it took weeks to recover before I could do basic stuff and months before I felt normal.
So glad to hear your on the mend Rick, I love your informative and interesting channel, take care mate and stay healthy 🎸🎸🎸🎶🎶😊😊🙏🏻
Get well, Rick.  You'll feel like a million dollars soon. I know what it's like to hit that afternoon wall.  No fun.
Take care Rick - be well - love your channel - stick around.
gAll the best to you! I'm so happy that you are well and healthy!  Please review Still Got The Blues by Gary Moore!
Wow. Very glad to hear you are doing well. Congrats on the successful surgery.
keep on truck'n!!!
God-Speed Brother.
So happy to hear you're on the mend. I recently had my first cardiac issue ( not like yours) I discovered (accidentally) I had stage 3 hypertension..  BP 193/130 no symptoms... on two drugs now BP in super normal range 118/80 avg. I got lucky,  I could have stroked out anytime.  I'm 55. Check your BP folks fwiw I have a very active job, lots of walking and heavy lifting so I was in no way sedentary and I don't smoke.  Life catches up to you, stay out in front.  Be safe. Peace.
I have an idea. Today's music is in no way as complex as the music of 50--60 years ago.  With the Advent of auto-tune, well, let's just say musicianship has gotten simpler. Perhaps you could highlight the change in complexity of modern music. There was a YouTuber who took a short snippet of Freddie Mercury's vocals and put it through four levels of Auto-Tune . By the 4th, most extreme level of auto-tune, I was beginning to think that anyone who does this should be arrested for crimes against humanity.
Take good care
Praying for a continued great recovery.
Keep on keeping on, like a bird that flew brother!
Glad you're OK. You're the only reason I keep the internet anymore.
Glad things went smoothly for you!
I"m glad you're doing well
I’d like more videos of how songs are written, arranged, and produced.
Hey Rick, glad to hear you’re doing well. You’re the best!
Sending healing vibes so glad you’re doing well as you heal. Thank you for all you do for the community.
So glad you are doing well!
You’d better hurry up and get yourself upright, it’s already hard enough to tell you and Anthony bourdain apart, don’t make it any harder!
It's good to see you back on your feet this quickly, and doing so well! Good update!
I had an open heart surgery at 56 and am 71 now living an active life. Thank for your videos Rick. Blessing from Australia. Take more holidays and rest and pay us a visit downunder.
Best wishes for continued healing.
Great news! My friend was 1 week away from his aortic valve replacement.  Healthy 67 year old. Walker, bicycle rider.  He had a hemoragitic stroke and passed away last week here in Jamestown, you know where Jamestown is, Rick. Dr said it was related to poor oxygenation of the blood.
Dude - that scar?    You're like Anthony Soprano.   Just like that.......😎
We love you just the way you are ( you could insert Billie Joel music it's OK🤪) so whatever you decide we will all tune in. Happy to hear your voice and see you alive and full of life.🤘🌞😘🇺🇸
Heal fast ser.
Wow ! This is a shock! Man, it makes me feel vulnerable.
My dad was one of the very first patients to have Mitral valve replacement in the UK about 65 years ago, at that time they lowered the body temperature for the surgery!
glad you're alright. The in depth interviews are my favorite on your channel. In my opinion, when you started to get interview access to all of the living legends you've talked to, the overall quality and cultural importance of your channel skyrocketed.
Glad to hear the surgery went well, Rick!
GOD Bless you!
Nothing over ten pounds...........play guitars........better leave those Les Pauls alone! 😂  Glad you are feeling well, Rick.  God bless.
Well done you. I have a stent inserted via my wrist. I also get 6 monthly cardio checks. What I have learnt is to be proactive as the medical system operates as an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.
So glad you’re back and healthy. If you weren’t, there would be a giant hole in a lot of lives.  That said, you’ve already left a treasure trove of amazing videos. You are so appreciated and loved by many!
Get well Rick....Love your videos.
I'm glad to see that you're doing great, Mr. Beato!  Special note to peanut gallery: I know how to spell, don't waste your time.
I'm subbed but don't have time to check in as often as I'd like. I just saw the pic of you in hospital, and was worried. Great to see you here and well.  I really like you and your channel.  Thanks to your surgical team for sorting you out! All the best to you.
Rick, Praise God for the success of your surgery!!  Thankful you had a great surgeon and you’re doing SO well.  ❤️  I’m a follower of Jesus Christ and I want to always remember to thank him for healing.  The Bible tells us God is the Great Physician.  He’s also my Savior.  John 3:16.  I’m at home healing from a sacral fracture.  Nothing like heart surgery, but does take some time for the bones to knit together.   God bless you and I look forward to more of your YouTubes.  I grew up in that era and love classic rock.  Am a big Eagles fan.  Also a pop fan I guess because I love me some Bee Gees.  🥰
Zappa? Great to hear you're back!
Thank you Rick! More power to you!
So glad you are on the mend and doing well.  To answer your question, I love all of the type of videos that you do, but by far, I enjoy your interviews the most.  Mainly because you're the best interviewer out there!  You know the ins and outs of the industry and the individual that you are interviewing.  You ask the best questions of anyone by far.  And I believe the musicians you interview see this as well and have a really good time being interviewed by you.  But I'll be watching no matter what kind of videos you do. 🙂
I have a colleague who bounced back from a busted heart valve and went from 5th degree black belt to 6th.  Take your meds and your recovery seriously and you will come out just fine.  Grats on the new monkey valve, too.
So happy you are still with us.
Amazing! Glad you're back in the groove!
Wow! Glad to see you're up and about so soon! I'm a few months older than you and had to have my mitral valve replaced nearly 3 years ago due to endocarditis and I was in hospital for 4 weeks after surgery.  Sternotomy scar still sore after all this time, but getting better.  It is rather weird knowing that your heart's been stopped and then jump-started! Surgeon advised clutching a cushion to my chest when coughing, which is all well and good, but when you sneeze...😵‍💫!! Welcome to the "zipper club" (on account of the 8"  scar being likened to a zip-fastener by my pals!)
Profound indeed. Thank God you are OK, may you teach us for many more years!
Glad you're doing so well!
Good To Your Okay Old Timer lol
Glad that you're up and about. Stay healthy!
I miss What Makes This Song Great?!
Happy to hear that you are healing well! Looking at you, I would have no idea that you had major heart surgery a week ago either. You look great!
Must be nice to have the option to get the medical attention you need.  If only we were all so fortunate to have access to expert treatment like this.  Glad you're feeling better!
So glad you’re doing better. 🙏
so happy all went well! I love your videos and love of music and your love of great musicians. You have introduced me to so many great musicians I had no idea existed and I thank you so much..
Getting older sucks!
Love seeing you back on the net. Be well & God Bless You!
I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse back in like 1999. The doc said after tests my heart was stronger than 99% of society at the time. Now the past few years I sleep a lot of the day...Have not seen a doc since 2007.  47 here. I just would like to thank you Mr. Beato for your experience.
So glad to hear you’re doing well and healing up! Thanks for all you do Rick!
Beato🎉 Glad to see you on the mend
We love you Rick! ❤
Glad you are on the mend.
I hope you went to the Rock N Roll Hall of fame!!!
Great news and hoping for a speedy recovery!
We love you Rick, get better soon 😊🎉
A speedy and full recovery dude!🙏
Thank u Rick. Take care! Was worried fir a sec 😅
Glad you're back bro. I appreciate you being vulnerable.  It only adds to the musical content. I wish you a speedy recovery!
So glad you're doing well. ❤❤❤❤❤
Rick, so happy to hear your update, thank you for sharing.  In so far as the channel & the way forward?! Whatever you do we will be happy YOU are doing it!  Good luck, God bless, mu
Very cool Rick! Welcome to the club…
Glad you had the best doctors, it helps a lot. And you're back so quickly like it never even happened. For the channel. Maybe you could make a Google survey because reading comments can take a long time.
Get well soon Rick... Just wanted to say I really appreciated your Keith Jarrett interview... First video that I saw of your music analysis was Never Gonna Let You Go... Then those powerful rock guitar riffs 👍🏻👍🏻
Fantastic news that you are on the mend Rick!
Glad to hear you are feeling so good already. My one tip is this. Several years ago I had a spontaneous tear in my carotid artery and to some extent, am lucky to be alive. I swore I would value every minute even more from that moment on. However, the grind of day to day life soon creeps in again and you go back to just being your old self and thinking you'll be around forever. So, every day,  keep reminding yourself how lucky you are to be alive and make the most of every moment. All the best.
I'm glad to hear your surgery went well. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Lots of hugs and kisses from all of us.
Best to you Rick !
Is this the hangout place for heart surgery veterans? I had my first AVR about 15 years back and am currently celebrating the anniversary of my second. Here's cheers to all you weak hearted music nerds.
Good 1 Rick keep up the good work
Good news Rick
Glad to hear you feel great so happy to hear that God bless Rick!!❤🙏
Rick, I ended up with heart failure back at the end of January… Had a stent put in to open up a 70% blockage of the widow maker artery.  Amazing what the Drs can do to help us get older safely.  I hope you continue to recover well. Love what you share with us. I’m 68 BTW.
So glad you're doing well Rick. Doctors are truly amazing what they can do, as is the human body...."First time my heart stopped beating in 62 years" Wow! Never forget, Jesus loves you! God bless my friend!
video idea, how about "amazing bands from other countries that werent successful in the u.s.a."?
701/2 year old, fell off a ladder 5 years ago, follow up visit Dr. says something is wrong w/heart…. congenital valve defect, Mom smoked and took uppers. It’s has been a tough road, but I have my strength back, 5-6 miles a day on my Fitbit. I should be dead as I was once a crack addict. Got sober..30 years…life is great, I love all kinds of  music, Log cabin in the Redwood, great retirement. Get Well Rick! 🌲⛰👨‍🌾🇺🇸🙏
I’m so glad you’re doing well. It sounds like you have a great doctor. I am inspired by your channel. Thank you!
Glad you’re back and that your operation was successful. Continued health and healing.
Fantastic.  Glad you are doing well.
Bendiciones Rick!!!
Glad all went well, and I absolutely love your interviews
Glad to hear you're on the mend Rick.  Didn't know you'd be up in my neck of the woods, plenty of good heart doctors around here.
Been thru all that twice in my life to replace my aortic valve
Glad that you are doing well!  10 lb limit...no heavy Les Pauls for you!!
Your voice sounds a little thin. A little reedy.  Remember, you're still in recovery. Take it slowly. Maybe think of doing something about John Mayall and how he was the trunk of the British blues tree.
I pray for your health! 🙏🏻 Can you recommend any teachers for Presonus Studio One Professional?
Protect Rick Beato at all costs ❤
Welcome back, Rick. Good to see you are doing well.
I am more intune with your channel after Stephen/ 3eB and your after surgery video!
And also a huge thank you for the medical professionals who dedicated their lives to saving yours and others.
Rick, we re so grateful that you not only watched your condition, you followed through and made the right decision to repair it. We need you to be here.  It might be a good idea to visit some collectors and see their rooms, designs, guitars, amps, effects, etc.  you might even be able to get some serious talented guitarists to come and play at these collectors homes. I for one would be interested in that.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Take care Rick
Great news Rick. Good luck!👍
You Look Great .... I'm Very Happy Your Back 😀
So good that you are well.
Dr Gillinov was let into the operating room to watch a heart surgey when he was 16 years old at the Cleveland Clinic  and started the spark for him to become a surgeon . cool story  , Get Well Rick
Mr Beato! Since a New Leaf after surgery, how about an Interview with PHIL KEAGGY?
Rick i had 5 bypass 8 years ago.  You are ghonna do amasing.  Exercise is key.   Best of luck.  You got this.
I´m glad you´re doing well, love your channel, keep rocking, best of wishes
I'm very happy to know you are so well after all! I like very much your videos and I must say, you are a captivating and charismatic person! Hi from Brazil! I loved hearing you play "Wave" by Jobim.
Glad everything went well, and that you're on the mend! Amazing what can be done nowadays!
Glad you're doing well, Rick!  Just put out any videos, we'll watch and enjoy them!
So glad to know that you are doing well. The advancement of medical science in our lifetimes (I'm about your age) is incredible!
I had my Mitral valve repaired and bypass of congenital artery defect in 2019. Now after a right knee replacement and at age 67, I’m doing great!
We're all glad you're on the mend, Rick! Thank you for the update.
Great to hear you’re better Rick!
Had open heart surgery two years ago in August 17. Had it done at UH Hospital in Cleveland Ohio by a guy that came from Cleveland clinic. Was head hunted by UH. Great surgeon and my quadruple bypass surgery was a great success. Was in three days and then a six week recovery and I’m good. So glad you had a great experience with your surgery!! Enjoy 🥃🥃🎉
My besr friend wasnt so lucky glad ur doing ok rick
I don't play guitar, but I love music. I do play piano and sing. My faves are the top 20 ones. Fun!
God bless you, Rick.
You’re a legend, wishing you a quick full recovery
My mom walked into the hospital at 15% EF, when must people come in on a gurney or in a wheelchair. Post op EF was 55%.
Lost some weight i can see but u dont look like a person who had open heart. Eat well, gain some weight, lets keep having fun! So glad everything is good.
Smart move🍀
love you brother 🙏🏼
I'm glad to hear you're ok! Be well!
I'm glad you are healing well and quickly. You said 62 almost like it's old lol, 62 is the new 30 I think. I like your song breakdowns, it's what brought me to your channel, but the interviews have been fantastic. I almost think you should continue to do them more. Either way we will all be watching.
Glad you are doing better amigo!😎👍✨💚
Glad you’re doing well.
Glad you pulled through with flying colors Rick.  I've lost two good friends at 55 and 50 in the last year, and being 50 something myself that leaves me unsettled.    Folks, I don't care if it's your heart, your kidneys, your colon, your digestive tract, an unexplained abnormality on your skin, etc.  When your body is sending you warning signs, please get it checked ASAP, especially if you're across the half century mark yourself.
👍
Stay healthy youngster
So glad you’re doing good!!!
Wonderful!  Thank God.
I’m happy that you’re doing so well after your heart surgery, Rick!!
Rick all the best and great health glad you are doing good 😊
Happy to hear you’re ok💪
Glad you're better, Rick.
🙏❤
Take care my friend.
Thank God for the doctors and nurses.
Thinking of you, your family, and loved ones. Hoping the surgery has given you many more years to share your thoughts with all of us. We value your opinions.
Hello from Tahiti Rick ! Been watching your videos since you had your son Dylan guessing chords by ear ! Very impressive !!! Great channel !!! Please give us an update on Dylan's journey and what he's doing today. Happy to see your doing great !
Congrats unc! 💪🙏✨
Had my valve repaired two years ago. Speedy recovery my friend.
Glad to know about your fast and great recovery. ❤
Rick, God bless you, regards from Canada, I love you so much! 🎉❤
Love you Rick. Take care. Happy you are on the mend.
Rick, u have built a channel that is based on your personality and your interest. You have built to 4.5m with us following you the whole way. If it is not obvious by now, you have the kind of personality and interest that we will continue to follow you weather you talk about your health, the music that interest you, other outside issues etc. I think by now you should believe that your audience trust you and your taste no matter what you want to talk about. You are interesting to me no matter the topic. Peace.
Happy to see you are healthy and recovering well. God bless you and give a full recovery. I'm a big fan of your videos.
happy recovery!
Take care of yourself Rick...Need you around for another 62 years....
I mean....Rock ON!!!!
Praise be to God! Modern medicine is amazing. I'm so glad your back at work providing us with the best interviews and discussions of popular music. Love you, Rick! P/S. God loves you! (and your viewers).
Rick, I hope that you are amending....Rock one!!!!!
SPEEDY RECOVERY!!!
You look good. Best wishes for a full recovery.
Thinking about you, man. Glad you are feeling better.
I'm sure this has already been said but a Huey Lewis quote seems appropriate : "The heart of rock & roll is still beatin'"
Glad to hear that all is good, Rick.  Wish you a full recovery.
Hey brother > eat more good oils sesame or olive >>>> also apply to your skin >>>> Ayurvedic medicine practitioner here > talk with trees regularly >>>> good job coming thru the other side
Love the interviews
Glad all went well, Rick!
So glad to see that you are on the mend. 🙏🏻
So happy you are back on track. Love your interviews, lessons and interaction with other channel talent. Get well soon.
Rip club 27 gets another one
My brother was born with a leaky valve and did the piggy thing @65.  He died on the table for a bit, but was walking around the block at the hospital two days after the surgery.
Just keep doing what you have been doing. Stay well!
I've been doing Nuclear Cardiology for over 30 years and understand what you're going through. God bless you. I'm glad you're okay.  As far as your channel....... Sir Paul McCartney.
Hey Rick, glad to hear your surgery was successful and your on the mend. The Cleveland Clinic Heart Center is a amazing Hospital with Worldwide care. When that building was being built the company that I work for had the carpentry package. It's possible that you stayed in a room that I actually did work in. Funny story near the end of that project. I happen to be on the VIP floor. Patiences were already having heart surgery at that time. I was walking down the corridor and a couple people and patient. Passed me by I looked up and said how is it going to the patient. He said okay as I got to the end of the corridor I realized I had just walked by Robin Williams the comedian. I'm sure you were on the VIP floor also. Glad you're feeling better. I enjoy your YouTube channel keep it up thanks. Tim
Wishing you well, Rick! Thanks for all the interesting music!!
Sorry I missed you in Cleveland, glad your doing better, love your channel.
Glad you had a great surgery and a great outcome - rapidly healing and don't let those calluses on the finders get weak!
Glad to see you're in such high spirits
🙏
Glad to see your doing well after the procedure for you heart. I'm 63 and can relate to your situation, I start to think of the worst when my body acts weird, Hope you do more interviews of your favorite musicians etc...
Happy for your recovery and wish you a long and healthy life!
Thank God, Rick! Its really nice to see you man. I dont know you in person but I send you a really big hug with all the good vibes. Take care a lot Rick, keep rockin' man, but easy jeje...God bless you Rick, greetings from Mexico.  GeLio! \m/
Glad your all fixed up and another 50 years please lol
Glad ur on the mend Mr. Beato!🤘
God bless you Rick. I am an OG follower of yours since like 2015. Keep going strong! Btw, my father had 2 open heart surgeries - Valves. Pretty scary - his 1st was done in 1990 by Dr Wayne Isom who did David Letterman's.
Speedy recovery and good health to you.
Im very happy for you Rick ❤ My mother had a heart valve replaced a year ago. It is as a successful day that day. Stay well my friends❤
All the best to you and a speedy recovery. We all need you back at it! Someone is going to make a video about you one day called “What makes this man great”, but not for sometime. Not sure I get the hospital bed recovery photo, is that a thing now?
Good  luck with it Rick. You look great.
Hearts, eh? Last December I had a heart attack. I had no idea, I thought it was a chest infection. So glad to hear that you've had the procedure and you're doing well.
Rick, be well. Steve
rooting for you, Rick!
More interviews are fine - you're the best interviewer around!  Glad you're back & feeling good.
Your channel made me change the way I hear music. Your breakdowns on songs make me appreciate things I never noticed before. Glad you're OK!
It’s a common condition and surgery. Glad you went to a top-notch center!
Glad you're doing well! Take your time.
Great to hear Rick❤ How about a review on “ Angel Dust” by FNM
Glad to hear everything went smoothly and as planned! Look forward to more videos!
Glad to see you "Back in the Saddle Again"! ❤
Rick, very happy that things went well and that you are back on your feet. Really enjoy the channel.
We need your heart to keep beating Rick , I love this channel and you've taught us so much. We need you around for a long time all the best.
So glad it went well!
Best wishes on a full recovery. Glad your surgery went so well.
Great news!!! Keep rockin’ Rick!
So glad everything was successful Rick. Here’s to a healthy life!
I am almost the same age as you and suffering from Afib. My energy level has dropped and if I get just a little too much salt my legs swell up. My prayers for a speedy recovery. I really enjoy your content. I always thought I had diverse/eclectic taste in music but you take it to a new level. Keep it up.
So glad you’re feeling better and that you got that taken care of!
Glad youre  ok Rick. Prayers for you!
Hey bro, I'm glad all went well. You're probably one of the few guys that's putting REAL music back on the map!! Stay healthy bro!
Sorry to know this late but I am happy for your speedy recovery Rick !! Blessings
As someone who has a severely damaged heart, I'm glad that you're doing so well!
Cleveland is the best Hospital for Heart surgery hands down. You did yourself the greatest favor. I have many friends and teachers from the past who wont shutup about the place because of their reknown reputation and because they themselves went there for heart issues. Rest up and take it easy!
Rick, SO glad and thankful you came through with flying colors! My father (who is in his 80s) had a similar procedure (he had a heart murmur for years). Of course WE were completely freaked out over it, but not him. And when he came out, he was a new man, with energy he hadn't had since he was young! (even more than his own kids!) Modern surgery is amazing. Be blessed Rick, we can't wait to see what else you have in store for us! 🙂
Glad to see you doing well!
Take care and look after yourself!
Rick, I am beyond happy for the success of your surgery. You are a man with an enormous heart… it’s good that you took care of it. As a fan, I wish you many years of music enjoyment.
Glad you're okay.  I had heart surgery 12 years ago.  Wishing you a full and speedy recovery.
God bless you, Rick.. The world will need you for a long, long time, brother..
Best wishes Rick. We're pulling for you.
So glad you're doing well, and you're on top of this! We need you around, and your family needs you even more. And, this video is a public service message for anyone with a heart to listen to the signals your body is sending.
Glad tohear you are doing good!
Glad your doing better Rick!
All the best Rick
Glad to hear you're making a speedy recovery Rick, wishing you good health and happiness always.
Dear Rick,  Enjoy your videos.  Play some bass and guitar.  Glad you went in and had your great heart worked on and that you are already posting more videos and on the mend walking around .  You are a blessing.
Glad you're doing well Rick...greetings from Cleveland dude !!!!...you were in the best place in the world to have your procedure...
Rick,   Love your content and glad you’re doing well 🤘🎸
God Bless.
Obvs next interview should be Huey Lewis.
I had it done in 2022 it was quite a miserable experience.
So glad you are okay. I do enjoy your videos! Stay healthy!!
glad you are feeling better.
Health is everything. Nothing else matters.  Nothing
great to hear you are doing so  well after surgery .
Blessings and Keep Swingin Rick, God Bless You!
So good you are successfully through surgery and into fully recovering.  Hope that improvement continues.  Tired in mid-afternoon?!  That’s me since 25.  But my affliction is an incurable arthritic one.  Keep mending Rick!  Take care all.
I am so glad you are recovering well, and I wish you a speedy and healthy recovery. My family loves your channel.  I find your song reviews to be a great way to educate the young ones about composition.  If you are thinking of a new direction, what if you used your platform to promote new artists. You could do that part time and call it NewbieTuesdays?
Good you did it now and not a few years down the road. Cheers from Colombia
Hope you make a full recovery and be around for another 62 yrs....🙏
Good to see you back rick ❤ you must know how much you mean to all
Great to see you looking and sounding so well. Onwards and upwards Rick 👍
Good health, Rick, and keep on doing your excellent work!
Glad you’re back !
Glad it went well, Rick!
Good to see your still you, hope your recovery is a swift and short one. Can you do a video on famous song(s) that have similar interval chord changes in different keys but evoke different feelings because of there tempos? Im pretty sure tempo mixed with certain chord intervals can make or break a song, again it depends on what algorithms are trending at the time but would be interesting to see if there is some kinda hack to writing a popular song....or could be the artists raw skill to convey a message to the listener, ok im babbling now😁
Doctors🤦🏽‍♂️ I’m glad everything went well! Wish you the best on your recovery! I’m 56 it’s hell getting old!
Wishing you all the best from NZ 🇳🇿
Love your channel. Glad you are ok!
Hey Rick, I'm 66 at the moment and was having heart problems 3 years ago. On a fluid and  salt reductive diet with medication but still doing well. Keep it up, you can become 100+
I had the same surgery 25 years ago, Still going strong!
Thank goodness for modern medical techniques.
My view about your surgery is CONGRATULATIONS - you dodged a bullet!! And my view about the channel is I TRUST YOUR JUDGEMENT and you teaching us whatever you might feel is necessary for us the rest of the world to learn.
Rick! It’s great to see you up and looking well ! I have enjoyed your channel for years and expect to do so for years more.
Awesome 🙏❤️🙏
Im happy to hear it was a success Rick
Glad you’re recovering well!
Speedy recovery Rick 🙏🙏 God Bless!!
10 LB.S?!... well, I guess you can't play a Les Paul for a few weeks:)
Heal well Rick!!
Hell yeah, brother. Take care of yourself. Just lost my uncle to heart issues.
All I want is for you to be healthy and happy. JT
maybe reviewing the top charts is not so healthy for you.. take care !
Get well.
Dude WTF! You were in town and didn't let me know! We could have done lunch. You would have paid of coarse.
So happy to hear your surgery went well. Take care!
Dear Rrrtick I have a pacemaker and it didnt bring amy limitations in to my life..... All the best... and perpetual thankfulness...!!
Love you from Israel ❤
Had the exact same surgery in 2020. Welcomes to the chest zipper club. Glad you’re doing great. Know exactly what you went through. Have watched you for so long , I consider you a friend. Take care.
Glad you are ok Rick!
Mad love, respect and much prayers for you and your family.  The world needs people like you and we need you here telling us how to do music!
glad you are well
Rick Beato must be protected at all cost!  Thank you Cleveland Clinic!
Happy that your surgery went well. Take things easy for now, but where's the fun in that! Stay safe!
Rick, I'm glad you're fine!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Glad you're still with us.
Glad to hear that you're recovering from your surgery, you look healthy. I'm sure you realized " that life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting" all kidding aside I don't know where you stand spiritually, but I would like to share the gospel with you. In Romans 3:23 the bible says "all have sinned and fallen short of The glory of God, Romans 6:23 " The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ" Rom. 10:9,10 "If you Openly declare Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved " (saved from the penalty of sin which is eternal separation from God) v. 10 For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved" "NLT. Jon. 14:6 Jesus made this profound statement " I Am the way, the truth and the life no one can come to the Father but through Me" I just want to encourage you to read the gospel of John and pray that the Holy Spirit would reveal truth to you. Jn/ 3:16 " For God so loved Rick that He gave is one and only unique Son that by trusting in His sacrifice you would receive everlasting life"
We just can't get rid of you
glad you are doing well !!! So I guess if you can't lift too much, you 've got to stay away from Gibsons for a bit...
Just keep doing you, Rick.  We’re here for you and whatever you produce.  [EDIT]. I WOULD LOVE to see you do some video game music.  I suggested Skyrim OST recently.
I'm glad you're allright. You're an icon.
Get well buddy!
Love what you do and I am glad you and your newly repaired heart ❤ are going to keep on doing it!
Rick, so happy that surgery went well and that you’re back!!! Regarding the channel, I enjoy your song breakdowns especially “what makes this song great”
Man.  Rest up Rick.  Glad to hear all is lookin up
Glad you're doing well, Rick! All the best to you and yours.
Glad everything went well for you. I am a big fan of your channel. Keep up the great work!
👍
Super happy you're ok. Love you sir. ♥
Glad you're feeling better Rick.  New ideas?  You're a big channel now Rick and though I love your interview with prominent rock stars (keep em coming, you need to interview Geddy and/or Alex as well as Sir Paul), it would be neat for you to interview independent artists that have made their name on youtube.  Think of someone like Ren for example.
God bless you Rick.
Get well, soon.
Glad you're doing well bud
Mr. Beato,  Glad to hear your doing well.  Hopefully you have many more incredible years of blessing us with your incredible ear, and talent.
Man....5 years and GO you had it DONE...NOW !! Congratulations and I have my Cardiologist visit this Thursday !  NOTE:  You'd never know you had Surgery man.....BTW. I watched Jim Messina @ 76 last Saturday in Ridgefield, CT., and he was just the BEST half of Loggins and Messina ! He'd be a GREAT GUEST for YOU Rick and Your move into the hopefully NOT Final Quarter of 2024 FREEDOM in MUSIC...Cousin Hoagy
My wife had this same surgury and is doing fantastic. So great to see you happy and healthy!
Much Rick appreciation from all … glad you are on the mend.
Does anybody know if this was open-heart surgery or a TVR  procedure where they do NOT  open the chest?  Just curious. 🙏🏼
Glad to hear Rick you’re very important for music as a whole
Only pick up the light Les Pauls for a bit.
Had a triple bypass in '22. Got thru it (got the pillow to clutch and managed not to sneeze for 6 weeks cuz that would have taken my head off), and it took a few months to get back to normal, but feeling better now. Glad you're on the mend.
Dont die rich rick 🖖
Glad to hear everything went well! Looking forward to see you back in the saddle!
Rick, congrats on your successful surgery….follow the doc’s advice….we need you brother!
Congratulations Rick !
Rick, so glad you're bouncing back so soon! I had a rough go. A sudden heart attack, 1.5 hrs CPR in ER. 3wks coma, in STL, 4 weeks recovery then ER airlift to Mayo in Rochester, MN for a heart and kidney. I was released to return home in March of 2023. Couldn't walk for any distance till Sept. But was able to stand with my daughter at her wedding in October 2023.  You look amazing, and you're right back at it, too. BRAVO! YOU ARE BLESSED!
So happy to see you recovering well and so quickly! God bless :)
Glad you are ok.
My home town !! Wish I could have bought you a beer or take you on a lakefront cruise !
Thank the Lord you are OK. Stay strong, young at heart and spread the love everywhere!
Nothing over 10 pounds = LesPaul 😃
Glad you are recovering well.  Heart issues are everywhere in my family, as well as a bunch of other not so much fun things, and it freaks me out as I think it does most of us.  We take that steady beat for granted.
Cleveland clinic is number 1 in heart surgery in the world !! Many of my friends work there as nurses and doctors. My son is in premed as a clinician !!
Good luck surviving American cuisine.
All the Best Rick!!   You’re good as ever now!
Happy to hear you're recovering nicely and feeling good! Love from back home in Fairport NY!
Wow!! Glad it went well and looking forward to 40 years of you rockin out!
Congratulations Rick!!! Keep on Jamming 🎸🎸🎸
Hang in there Rick.  Glad you’re feeling better.  I’ve been enjoying your videos for a long time 👍
Love your channel. Hope you get better soon. Take care.
Stay strong
awesome to hear this good news
I'm very glad to hear that you are much better now 😊
So thankful you’re still with us. Really enjoy your show. Hope you live a long time. 🙂
First of all let me say how much I enjoy watching your videos, you do have a natural talent for interviewing musicians I admire and every time I watch one of your videos I feel I have really learned many things 🙂🙂 Second, I wish you a very speedy and permanent recovery from the bottom of my heart ( no pun intended ) I also did have some problems with my heart many years ago and it's nothing but a distant memory so I'm sure it will be the same for you too... Be well 👍👍
I’m so glad you’re well, Rick!
Welcome back brother. 🤟🏻
After his heart bypass, my friend had a new lease of life for another 26 years.  I wish you a speedy recovery!   ❤
Man, it would break my heart if yours wasn’t working right! Wishing you all the best in your recovery!! 👍🏼☮️
What Makes This Song Great!, just love it. Do more Rick. All the best. Greetings from Nazaré, Portugal.
Great to hear you’re doing better love your channel keep up the good work… I personally love how when you’re interviewing people you’re asking Mike placement kinda vamp, kind of speakers in the amps. I’m such a recording, nerd and have been recording for most of my life I just love the Way you interview people interview people.
Good to see you doing well Rick 👍🏻 👍🏻
Keep on Rock’n🤘🤘  .
Glad it went well and you’re recovering so nicely. Sending love to you, brother.
You look great, glad you're past the surgery and doing so well.
Sooo happy to see you vertical, Rick! And The Beato Goes On….! 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
Best of love to you and so happy you are doing better. A Fan: Schiffy
So glad you are ok Rick...love the channel. Highlights have been the nuno, marry Friedman and Paul Gilbert interviews...nuno is so funny and does not age
God bless you
No lifting of classic Les Pauls!
The Cleveland Clinic is the best in the USA for the heart Rick.
Good to see that it went so well.
Thank god you're ok.
God bless Rick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  May the force be with you too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're a good Man Rick so glad you're doing well. GOD BLESS

WOW Rick. DANG Please get well soon! And stay well!
May you have continual good health mate. ❤
Glad you're doing great Rick
Rick I did not know you had anything going on, I'm very glad everything went well, and they patched you all up. I can relate, I'm battling a serious spinal condition steming from the military, 17 major spinal surgeries in 3 years, and #18, and hopefully last in a few months. Basic walking isn't possible right now, but hopefully again after next surgery.  Look fwd to seeing what you have coming up next. Thnks for doing all you do, I learn something new from you every day almost, and I envy your musical knowledge, trying to learn more from you Get feeling better soon, and thank you again for all you do. 😎🎸
Glad you are continuing to do what you do! I hope you took the opportunity to visit the Rock Hall of Fame. I had the fortunate experience of going there on a flight layover. It was like going to Mecca for me! Be well, my brother!
Glad you're on the mend. Best wishes👍
Get well! Glad you're felling fine. Your channel is amazing. God bless!
Rick so glad everything is going  good w you're recovery God Bless You!
Life is precious! 🎸🎶
Glad your back! Great Content on a variety of guitar stuff.  Keep up the great work!
Rick, Glad you are doing well! Good to see you! 👍
Get well soon! A proper recovery and lots of rest is important, especially after surgery. Follow all the doctor's instructions to a "T"!  You are a national treasure and a music icon too!  The Music Industry needs you!!
Godspeed Rick! very happy that your healing well!
Ten thousand thumbs up Rick!!!!!
Glad you’re taking care of yourself Rick.
3 of my close people had heart attacks within one year. I’m going for a check up next week ☺️☺️
Glad your doing good Rick!
I’m so glad your operation went well Rick.
Rick!! I too have been 'offline' for the last 6 days for operations.... SO glad to hear that you are now sorted! Take it easy m'man!! Catch you later.
Sir, take care of yourself, we are glad you are doing fine!
Content de te voir, Rick, glad to see you, la Force est en toi, continue de partager avec humour et bonne humeur, you are great, man ! yours friendly, Phil
WoW, you look great!  a relative had the same type of surgery and it was tough to recover from.  I'm amazed.  Keep doing the things you enjoy and the rest of us can learn from it..
So glad to hear you are doing good Rick. Now, take it easy!  :)
Glad everything went fine¡
❤. All respect.
I've just got stents, do what the doc and rehab folks say to do, you will be fine.
Great to hear all went well Rick.
Good luck to you. From the UK.
Congrats on your success. Rick. I just returned from a triple bypass, 71 here... wonderful tech, eh? I feel great.
Wish the best for you. Thankyou for the videos and your passion.
Good to hear you are alright. Bad news is Don Henley is going to copyright strike this video.
Amazing! What they can do these days!!!
Just be you and live your way. if people like me do come to your channel its because of my choice , but as a low power fm station person (many , many hats, etc.) in downtown San jose, california. Always the best to all, live you life your way
Wow. That was an incredibly successful surgery oh my
I've been having issues for a while now and getting worse.  I keep hearing AFib and heart commercials  Time to get checked.  Hope all goes well for your Rick!
Rick…SO glad you’re on the mend. You are such an incredibly valuable guy to so many people you’ll never meet. PS…don’t cough brother.
I'm really glad you posted this. I too have mitral valve regurgitation and this makes me much less nervous about the day I may have to have surgery. Haven't had a cardiac checkup in a while and will ask about that at my next physical. Glad you're on the mend! We all get so much out of your videos.
I thought I recognized the heart-shaped pillow. I had quad bypass 5 years ago and haven’t felt better. I love the channel especially the “what makes this ……. great”. Carry on my friend!  Tony, age 72.
Went through the same thing in ‘21. We are the same age. I had mine done at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Did they repair or replace? Mine was replaced with an artificial valve.
Glad all is well.
Hey Rick, glad you’re better. I had almost the same surgery, however they performed, what they call , “minimally invasive” mitral valve repair.  Maybe minimal invasive, but I looked like I was in a knife fight, 11 puncture wounds throughout my upper body.  They said soon they should be able to do the entire procedure from only going up through the femoral artery.  Love advances in technology. Anyway glad you’re doing well, love your show.
Thank you for sharing Rick! Glad to hear you're on the mend!
Personally, I love everything about your channel Rick. If I had to pick I would say your interviews are my favorites, really eye opening and mind blowing interviews, I’ve learned so much about different artists and types of music I would probably never been exposed to if not for your channel! God Bless you man and keep doing what you do!❤
Rick, you are the best. To a speedy recovery !
Glad you are ok Rick Having surgery like that really makes you grateful for every day!! God bless.
Wow Rick.....scared the pants off me! Glad you're on the mend!
Glad you're on the mend!
So glad you er ok! Get a great recovery, we need lots of you content for years to come.
I am happy that you feel better!!
Can't play a Les Paul....  Glad you are okay.
Wow! that'S great news!!!!!
I love everything you do ❤ u have many fans from Australia 🇦🇺
I wish you the best and prompt recovery👍 Friendly regards from a French fan😍
we love everything you do Rick. Stay Healthy & Keep shining !!!! 🔥🤘🌟
I didn't even know he was sick, as they say.
Gute Besserung, lieber Rick
Glad to know you are doing so well. Stay strong, you make the world a better place. Greetings from Australia.
Rick sending prayers just saw this.  Glad you are back on track. God Bless!
Power to you, Rick! So, glad you're still with us and doing well!
Dont play an older Les Paul.. too heavy :)
Very good news for yourself. Many more fruitful years ahead for you and keep up the great teaching with the channel.   It puts a new perspective on life with such events.   Wishing you the best for your future.  Ed Prokop
Glad you're doing well
Get well soon Rick so you can get back to your recent new "What makes this song suck" series :)
Rick, your health is more important than anything else.  You have a lot of people who truly care about you.
Love both.  Keep doing what you love.  Very happy the surgery has been very successful.  Thank you.
I didn't even realize, glad you are on the mend.
Glad to hear that you’re doing well
❤❤❤❤you are a treasure. Very glad it all went well. Take good care!!!!
Too bad you can't play the Les Paul 😪 jk Here's to a speedy recovery
Carry on my wayward son....
All the very best to you Rick. You're a great guy and glad to hear your recovery is so quick.
10 lbs? Better weigh any Les Pauls before you pick them up…😂
Thank you for all your inspiration, both on your surgery, and to us 60 or so year old music fanatics. Love it all, but really love the song breakdowns the most.  Fascinating to hear classic and favorite songs broken down in individual parts. Thx. Good luck. Hope to watch you for years to come.
Love this chanel.  Cheers to you and your recovery!!  All the best.
1:37 we are so glad you are out the other side of this. Every musician I know talks about your videos every week. Keep on rocking!!! You make our lives better!!!🤘🤘🤘
Glad you're on the mend.  Hoping the Crimso guys from Beat do a cover of Heartbeat for ya
Glad you’re on the mend. In terms of content; everything you do is so worthwhile. We’re extremely lucky to have you around…
Best wishes, Rick! I’m also 62 and was lucky enough to work on a heart-lung machine and watch several surgeries. You were in great hands at the Cleveland Clinic. Looking forward to more great content after your recovery!
So glad you're through it Rick. Hope you're feeling better - and I hope you feel the collective love mate.
Awesome news, God Speed for your recovery!
Rick, I am glad the surgery went so well. Good health to you, Man!
Glad to hear all is well.
I'm happy to have you back, you're one of the very best out there.
Glad the good folks at the Cleveland Clinic took good care of you Rick! Feel free to come back to Cleveland for fun next time!
Ain’t the Clinic the absolute best?  The neurologists there saved my wife’s life when she had a brain aneurism. I go there for my urologist.
I'm glad your doing fine Rick!! all the best🤟
I love the interviews the best!
Glad you're healthy!
Lookin' great! Wishing you a swift recovery.
God bless you. Take care yourself! Cheers!
Love you Rick! National treasure ❤
Glad you're well. I'm a BIG fan. My wife did 3 surgeries to fix the mitral valve, finally replacing it with a bovine/cow valve and she's doing great.
Take care of yourself Rick!
Take care Rick! ❤
Glad you are doing well✨🙏🏼 for continued recovery!🎼🎸
Best wishes, Rick, with a speedy recovery - it sounds promising.
Hola Maestro me alegra muchísimo que todo haya ido bien y verte tan animado..gracias por todo lo que nos das, y compartir está experiencia vital con todos nosotros...❤...

Glad to see you're doing well.  God bless you and your family.
I used to work there (Clev. Clinic) . . . lots of famous/wealthy people go there for cardiac surgery - you were in good hands . . .best of luck for complete and full recovery.
Glad you're doing well Rick! I had an aortic valve replacement years ago and now I surf two hours everyday; it's amazing what they can do these days.
sorry earing that,hop it's a gaz soon,great content ,very interesting 'daniel lanois' video ty take care of you
Glad to hear you're okay.
after a few weeks of rehabilitation you'll feel like new, as we often see with our patients, and a new career is ahead of you. get well soon and much success in your personal life and your work (a music-loving surgeon from algeria).
So nice to hear that your surgery went well and best wishes to you.
Happy to hear you’re on the mend! 💪🏻
I believe I’m a few months older than you. All’s good so far. Get well. In enjoy your channel.
Same cohort, we are tough.  Keep at it Rick!
👏 💪🏻 💕
Dear Rick am glad to see you in good shape after surgery. I really like your videos because i have similarities in your opinions about music. I also play guitar and you are one of my favourite YouTube musicians. Some people say that you are boomer and old man who dont like nowdays music,but i dont think so.I would like to suggest you that in next period you should explore some EX-Yugoslavian rock and hard rock music because we had great bands and musicians from that time.Please stay tuned and rocking hard. Greets from your fan from Bosnia!!
Glad you're doing well, sir! Regarding the channel, I dig the interviews -- you've gotten some fascinating guests! I miss the song analyses, especially "What Makes This Song Great". I would love to see that aspect of your content make a comeback.
Glad the surgery went well and all is ok. Look forward to many more years of your videos. Be well.
i also have a heart prob. Stay well, m'friend...
Stay healthy, my brother... Popular music needs you as a compass... Veracity & candor are why you are so respected!
I'm 77 and have mitral valve prolapse in all 4 chambers of my heart. I was diagnosed 20 years ago. Other than the occasional vfib blip, I haven't had any issues. I'm glad to hear you had successful surgery and look forward to your complete recovery. I hope that I have the same outcome should it become necessary.
Song break downs with the artist/ band
MY SON HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY AT SICK KIDS IN TORONTO. They repaired 5 defects in his heart. He was gray going in and pink and warm and sitting up and playing with his toys after 6 hours of surgery and 4 hours in recovery. EVEN THE DOCTORS COULD NOT BELIVE IT WAS THE SAME BOY GOING IN.Yiu will feel much better after the stitches heal up
My husband and I thoroughly enjoy your amazing talent, your YouTube content and creativity.  Thank you for sharing your Health story!  (It sounded like you were telling my story) I am scheduled for Mitral Valve Repair in two weeks. It’s scary for me, but I’m ready for post surgery recovery and improved quality of life. Thank you for your example of positivity!  Keep the professional and creative content coming. Best to you. ❤
Glad to hear you are back to 100%.  Keep making great videos!!
Glad to hear you are doing so well, Rick! I enjoy your videos - keep 'em coming!
You are loved and admired my friend.
Glad you're on the mend !
Rick, I'm glad that your surgery went well and that you are healing. I look forward to seeing your upcoming content. Thank you 😊
Glad it went well, take care always
We love you. Hang in there.
So happy for you! Glad everything went well and you’re feeling great. More Beato videos for all of us!!!
I'm so glad you're ok
Get well soon Rick.  My son, 32, had the same operation and is doing great.  x
Best wishes for a speedy recovery!
Really great news Rick! Glad you’re doing well!! ✌️❤️🙏
Wow, Rick, sounds like you just went through the mill! I’m so glad you’re OK. I can’t imagine a world without Rick Beato. You contribute so much to all of us music lovers. You seem like a really driven guy, but your well being is the most important thing right now. So please take it easy and give yourself time to heal. The channel can wait. Besides, there’s years of great material to catch up on.
Be well, Rick. Heal well.
Glad you seem to be doing well now. As far as the future of the channel goes, I love the interviews! I know its not really giving you a direction or anything but Id like to just continue to watch you talk about what you are passionate about and where your muses take you. Personally, I think that is the most entertaining thing asking "Whats he gonna do next?"
Good you nip it before it gets worse.  Heart valve failure = enlarged heart to compensate.  If enlargement goes too far then heart valve repair distorts when a more efficient heart shrinks.  Like any muscle, so getting done at optimum time = less heart distortion for valves to fit.  You're a great resource to all.
Hope everything is okay with you and your heart keeping beating and rocking, Rick!
I'm glad you are back and all is well! best wishes again from England mate!
I wish you well and get better
Good to see you on the other side of surgery, Rick. I'm only two-years older than you but I feel dead-beat by the middle of most afternoons! And I don't think it's my heart! I admire your energy and love your discerning ear. You will feel ten-years younger in a month from now. Wishing you continued health and strength! 💪👍
So glad you’re on the mend, Rick. Don’t lift a 70s Les Paul as they are more than 10 pounds. 😄
So glad to hear that everything went so well in your surgery. 😎👍
Thankful you are ok, Rick. Going to finally remember to subscribe. I'm really curious about why they couldn't do your surgery robotically- did they give you specifics?
Glad you're ok, Rick!
glad to hear everything went well. wish you a speedy recovery sir
So pleased it went went for you and you're back and will be even better than before. Best wishes and more power to you.
Look after yourself, Rick!
So happy for you Rick!🙏🏻♥️ I wish you the best of health!
Great news!  Glad to hear you are well and improving quickly!  The world needs more Rick Beato!  Thank you for sharing your journey and knowledge, always! 🤗♥
Happy you are doing good Rick. You are a great teacher of music theory and truly, how to listen, to the parts of the songs and appreciation for music. ❤
Stay healthy! We need you around as long as possible!
Glad to hear everything went well, and hope for a speedy recovery! Please try and get interviews with Eddie Vedder, Adam Duritz, Dave Grohl, Alanis Morissette, Raine Maida, Joan Jett, Billie Eilish, and Ray LaMontagne! No rush, maybe by next week or so! I would love to see any one of them on your channel! :)
Glad your oke Rick!
You are in great shape and think of you as a brave guy as well!! It's not that easy to recover in the way you did. Congrats 🎉🎉❤❤
Great to hear your on the mend ! it’s amazing what surgeons do as well as the support staff! ❤
Glad you are doing well! Love the song breakdowns BTW. It makes me hear things I never heard before...then hear them all the time when listening to the songs!
So glad you are doing well sir. Keep doing great interviews!
Welcome back Rick. Glad all went well buddy!!
Rick, would love you to interview Billy Cox, the last surviving band member of Jimi Hendrix. It would be great to record his memories for future generations.
I am glad you are better. Keep it up Rick.
My father had the same operation as you back in 1977. Let's say that the procedure was much less optimal as it is now and he spent several weeks at the hospital, then a couple of months at a nursing home. But he managed to live another thirty years and died at 74 of a completely unrelated health problem.
I'm glad your surgery went well. Take care Rick!
I'm happy you're okay Rick. I was hoping at some point you could talk about Khruangbin and/or Leon Bridges on your show. I think they are outstanding and I say so from the perspective of being in my 50s and finding something new and cool with the same feeling as had for some of the music I got excited about in my 20s.
Thankful your surgery was so successful! Best wishes for a full recovery and then some!
Stay strong Rick ! And keep it up !!
I love your lyrics, "no nothing?" 😅
Hey Rick, I'm so glad to see you are back on your feet and doing well. God bless!
Glad to hear that you are doing well. Best wishes for a speedy recovery!
Glad you are fixed up! I like the mix of ALL the things you do but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the short clips of guitar instruction. Or, maybe the interviews. Or, maybe the full song breakdowns of what makes a song great. Or maybe it's the theory lectures. The production breaksown videos are definitely my favorite! But also, the state of the music industry and current events are my favorite. Or your breakdown of the top 10 or 20 whatever it is.  THOSE are ALL my favorite! Keep doing those types of videos!
Sir, you are a treasure for the. Music world 🌎 we love you, Soo nice to see you in good health. I pray for your complete Recovery on future Pleasent endeavour
Glad you are healthy Rick! I love your interviews but miss your theory videos as well. Maybe you are doing them and the algorithm is not hitting me.
Hope ur feeling better
My prayers are with you. God Bless!
Glad you're on the mend!
Thank God you're good. Blessing
Great news God bless you brother.
Rick,   I am from Brazil and discovered your channel in YouTube this weekend. Relevant contents ever!  All the best for you and for tour recovery!
Your channels are gold and I'm grateful you're doing what you do. Very glad you made it through this and are doing better. Keep up the awesome and inspiring work!
I missed the previous post(s), so I was a bit shocked when I saw the thumbnail. Very relieved to see you smiling and looking so well. You should be good for at least another 5,000 videos I guess.
Get fully well Rick.  God bless. ❤
Great to hear you are doing fine. Looking forward to many more Beato videos. As a dentist I see a lot of elderly patients who have had this surgery and heart valve replacement and they are fine, many having had the surgery years ago.
Glad your well.  I love your interviews.  Your approach and informative questions are great. Home you interview some more big names
This is great news. If you can still rock out, everything is cool. Grab a guitar and jam it out. There's nothing better. For the show, I'd like to see Brian Setzer and Jerry Cantrell again. The Stevie Ray Vaughan licks are great to teach. I love the blues and want to teach the young generation who might be just learning our music. They need to know what a wrecking crew is and make new ones with new artists.   They don't know about Gregg Allman, Little Feat, Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton and what people were like at the festivals back in the 1970's and 80's. We had a lot of fun back then. The Peach Festival used to be a really cool thing in Scranton, PA. They don't know how cool we were.  I caught AC/DC's "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" as soon as it came out in 1981. That was my first new album that I bought. My brothers and sisters left me a cabinet of records in the early 1980's of Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead, Beach Boys, Cream, Derek and The Dominos, John Denver, Eagles, The Beatles (And Others).    The guy in "Almost Famous" had the same experiences as me. I was very young and 3 people left the house. They left me all their records. I set up a drum set and started learning all the songs on percussion. I took drum lessons at the LI Drum Center in Commack, NY. I don't know where they are located, but I saw my drum teacher on-line John Favicchia. He's a phenom. Check him out.   I just started guitar. I have an acoustic guitar and I'm learning from scratch. I am going to start lessons.
Glad you’re feeling better Rick
God bless you ❤
Just keep on keeping on.!  More power to you.!!!  Nuff said. 👍🏻
Glad you’re feeling better but disappointed to not see you in Cleveland! Glad the Clinic took care of you
Hey, Rick!!! Soooo glad you're doing well after surgery! Continue to get better, and take care of yourself!!! From a fan of classic Journey/Steve Perry, and of Nuno Bettencourt/Extreme!!!
I don't know you but I wish you a long life. Keep the faith for your family don't  Think about us! Be well!
Glad it’s over… and seeing you recover nicely
I'm glad you are doing well! I like listening to you no matter what you cover. I'll always enjoy the song break downs.
Glad you're well! God speed..and thank you for all you give.
Best wishes, Brother! Thank you for your valuable interviews and love for music. Big Hugs from Barcelona
That's great news! You look and sound great. Hope for a quick healing! I turn 62 in a month....
Looking at you I would never have thought that you had that type of surgery a week ago. 😮🍀
We wish you prompt restoration....here in Brasil we love you!! Health Rick!!
I had my open heart surgery in November, I'm 53. I'm finally getting some feeling back around my long chest scar. It's amazing what they can do now. I wish you a very speedy recovery and if you have any questions send them my way. Ps, lean towards your SG's and hold off on the LP's for a bit.
Heal well Rick. Praying for your quick recovery. Love from India ❤
Ti voglio bene Rick. Sei fantastico !!!! Il Maestro in assoluto in the entire world !!!!! We'll be waiting for you for  other tips
Go Rick!
Been there. As a septuagenarian, in the middle of the covid pandemic. Scary. Had a great surgeon. I was totally blown away when he came to me and said I could skip the rehab and go home. Glad all went well. Happy healing.
I'm glad you are ok, I'll pray for your continued well being.
❤
Great to hear your ok Rick! I had health trouble too last year to the point of seriously thinking I was gonna die for real. Cutting out suger entirely and most fast carbs and any dairy and seed oils such as sunflower seed-canola oil-and any and every inflammatory oils except for coconut and extra virgin Olive oil which the only 2 oils that are not inflammatory, has drastically healed my organs over a year period. Lots of lemon, raw uncooked olive oil(Un mixed) cayenne pepper Turmeric, with meat and a daily intake of raw garlic has greatly healed and restored my organs. Great for heart health. Love your work
Greetings from Cleveland!  We have the best medical in the world.  Glad your Ok.
Glad you’re doing well. I really enjoyed your interviews. You do a great job of asking questions and gathering information. Hopefully you’ll do more in the new year of your planning.
God bless you!
❤
I’m so happy you’re back and feeling well!
Looking good sir! Sending love from the UK :)
Rick:  I'm very happy but a bit jealous of your open heart surgery experience.  I had a double bypass last August, I was in some serious pain for about a month afterwards; it took two months for me to feel somewhat normal, and over three months to feel like I could go back to work.  And forget about coughing; the pain would bring me to my knees.  I recognized that red pillow on your hospital bed; I'll keep mine as a souvenir of a time I'd like to forget.  Now, as for the direction of the channel:  I like the interviews, but I miss What Makes This Song Great, as well as your Top Ten reviews.  Bring 'em back please!
Please take care of yourself Rick, you have the one channel that makes Youtube worth existing and we need you here!
Glad you’re doing well.
Deep respect to you Rick.
Have you lost weight?
Great to see you getting better quickly Rick! I'm excited to see what you're planning next.
Can't lift over 10 lbs., so no playing the Les Paul!
Heal up Well!!!!
Incredible, Rick! You look great! Happy to know everything went well! Cheers, my friend!
Best speedy recovery wishes 🍀🍀🍀
happy to see you doing well!
godspeed sir
Hey Rick, Glad to hear that you are doing well.  May God Bless You Abundantly!
Best wishes for a speedy recovery, Rick!  My favorite videos on your channel are the more comprehensive breakdowns of the songs you love - Wichita Lineman is my all time favorite.  I learn a lot from all of your work, but those breakdowns are incredibly insightful and meaningful for listeners.
Take care, Rick, and get well soon.  You've been a treasure on YouTube who I've been following for several years.  I love your music commentary and music theory lessons, not to mention your interviews with important people, and I hope the Good Lord gives you many more years of life.
Rick … I am now nearing 12 weeks off of a bypass and aortic root/valve replacement. A little more involved but we share the same scar. Continued luck on your healing .. that six week mark is a biggie!
Good to see back RICK GODSPEED brother …
Thank God you got back in 1 piece! Love fromm Germany ❤
I would love to see you revist your "The Top .. intros/riffs/solos (etc.) Of all time and see if you would add, remove or move any of your choices
Glad to hear that your surgery went well, Rick.  You’re an amazing You Tube host.  Love all the artist interviews you’ve done.  Keep healthy my friend.
Glad everything is ok now! Wish you the best and a fast recovery
I’m sorry man that sucks cause you have to do it even if your scared of  it you  still have to do it  I pray Jesus puts his hand on your hart and heals your hart  the content is amazing just stay the same and alive please 🙏
Keep well - I too had my first surgery in the past couple of years and I'm 80! And thriving ! So, as the cliché has it: keep on keeping on. Love the channel `and your interview with Tommy Emmanuel is the one I have shared the most. And the recipients are now regular viewers…what you offer isn so valuable, your insights so keen…Buckets of gratitude!! From London, England.
Love the channel and so glad you you got your surgery done and that it appears to be successful. I hope you're feeling 100% as soon as possible!
Great news, Rick, and thanks for sharing with your fans.
Hey, I had a mitral valve repair done too - 5 years ago, no problems at all since then!
Sending pos' vibes and prayers for healing and comfort. Hang in there Rick- you are a cultural treasure!
I'm very happy that you are OK. Take it easy and relax, when you make the videos, I'll watch them. Please do take care of yourself; by doing that, you're taking care of us. Godspeed.
You make me feel a bit better about my Stent procedure  coming up. But like they say everyone's different.
Good to hear that you're doing great! Really appreciate your channel. Take care!
So... the next "What makes this song so great"? ....Sheer Heart Attack by Queen.
Get well and God Bless!
Cleveland Clinic is the best in the world.
Dr. Mark G did my dad's mitral valve in 2008. He was the best in the world even then. Glad you are well, Rick!
So glad you're doing well...as we get older our mortality is more and more brought to our attention...really glad you're doing so well!😁
Glad your feeling better getting ready to have three .
Wishing you all the best Rick!!
My heart❤does so well b/c of you. Thank you for that. Wishing your heart lots of good vibes and sunshine for a speedy recovery.
Wishing you a quick a wonderful recovery Rick! Two years older than you, and went to Cleveland Clinic last year---all good. Got to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a bonus. Hacksaw Harry
I feel that I've gotten to know you as a friend Rick over these past few years - recently I watched, and really took in, your piece on the Joe Pass record that brought you to the next level.  We both approach guitar and music in very similar ways.  Grateful that your surgery went smoothly, and may your healing be speedy and ueventful.  G-d bless.
I love the interviews but would like to see more song breakdowns, theory, and stuff about recording besides the interviews. Maybe make interviews once every month or two. But most importantly, I’m glad surgery went well and that you’re feeling better :)
God bless Rick.  Shout out to the great peeps at the Cleveland Clinic.  I used to live just up the street in the Heights.  Cleveland rocks for sure.  They have some amazing people.
Dear Rick, let me wish you quick and successful recovery. I look forward to learn even more about music from you in the future. Fingers crossed, mate! ❤ Jiri aka G9
Rick, you're a treasure and we love you!  Please take care...prayers for continued recovery!
great to hear that your surgery went well and you're all good to go eventho still in recovery. I've been watching your videos for few years now and hoped that I'd be on time for lives you do in here :D hopefully someday I'm able to do that too
Glad to hear of your medical success.  Appreciate  your perceptions on music, and especially the theory, and looking forward to many more videos.
My best wishes for a full recovery and continued good health. Thank you for being here. I've lost too many of my heros in the last two years from Marvin Hagerler to Wayne Shorter.
Get well soon Rick and stay as you are! All the best from your German friends!❤❤❤
Stairway to heaven ....Heart
Best wishes for a complete recovery.
More interviews and more health!
Looking forward to more great interview and your views on the modern music business and where its going. They are really very inspiring.
So glad you're doing well after surgery. I've appreciated your channel for quite a while know and hope you still have many years ahead of you! God bless.
Get well, Buddy.  Best channel on YouTube and I've turned on many happy people to you, musicians or just humble appreciators.
Congrats on a successful operation.
God bless you, my friend!
so i met a guy who is getting the first robotic heart, i am sure you can look it up, it hasn't been done before, but i met him maybe in may2024? so maybe it happened, by now.   he was funny because we were joking about being heartless, and he wanted to put his old heart in one of those liquid jars to be next to him at night, because he thinks there is a soul connection to it,  The heart has its own communication system, often referred to as the "heart-brain connection" or the "heart's intelligence." The heart has a complex network of neurons, neurotransmitters, proteins, and support cells, which enable it to process information, make decisions, and communicate with the brain and other organs in the body. Some fascinating facts about the heart's communication system: The heart sends more information to the brain than the brain sends to the heart, which suggests that the heart plays a significant role in influencing our emotions, intuitions, and decision-making processes. The heart's electromagnetic field is about 5,000 times stronger than the brain's, and it can be detected several feet away from the body. The heart produces a hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which regulates blood pressure and has a calming effect on the nervous system. Positive emotions, such as love, gratitude, and joy, have been shown to increase coherence between the heart and brain, leading to improved health and well-being.
So glad to hear that you’re making a speedy and uneventful recovery! Best wishes from us here in the north of Scotland!
The level of care is very high--these guys are pros--have a relaxed recovery.
Stay well.....and take care!  We want you and your videos around for a L O N G time!
I have read that Cleveland Clinic has the best heart care in the world! God Bless! ❤
Have a swift recovery.
Hope all is well!!  Love the channel!!!
Rock On Rick 👊🇺🇲👍
Well just take your time to fully heal that ur ❤ beat for music and us at least another 62 yrs to come
weiterhin gute Besserung. Keep on rocking
“Doc, it kinda hurts when I cough”… “Well then, don’t cough”… 😂  Be well, Rick!
BeWell&StayWell Rick, I endured a 3 vessel CABG in 07/19. I was 67 then. Glad you had a better experience than me.
Glad you're okay man! 🙏
I had the same surgery in 2009 I was 43 at the time. Thank God for modern medicine. Wishing you a speedy recovery!
Glad you're on the mend!  I'm hoping to catch mine with the robot- the story is much the same as yours.
Glad it went well, hope ya feel better bro
You da man Rick. Love your videos.  God bless.
Dear Rick,  I wish you a quick recovery and let your heart go on for another 62 years! Thank you for what you’re doing both musically and as a person. It’s always a great pleasure to watch your videos and I’m glad you‘re back on track and feeling well!
Glad yer better Holmes!  Yer an inspiration
Rick it's good you're OK - just keep going as the channel is great, and go at the pace that suits you.  👍
i love you. we don't want to lose you.....ever!
I am glad you are fine!
Welcome to the club, Brother Rick !!!  I had my mitral valve replaced 7 weeks ago today (same reason as you: severe regurgitation). But, boy !!!  I didn't look anywhere near as good as you after ONE week !!! (maybe I never did look as good as you !!!) However, they performed a triple-bypass while they were at it and installed a pacemaker just to be sure as there was a ka-blip every so often. I got an Edwards Scientific 31mm mitris resilia valve, which I was told is the Gibson Les Paul Custom (maybe even PRS) of the replacement valve world.  I am SO glad to hear that you are doing well !!! We all love you and look forward to your videos !!!  The interviews are great, but I personally think that the song breakdowns are pure gold !!!
Rick! Stay healthy! We NEED so many more interviews. Dave Grohl, Paul McCartney, among others!
Great to see your bouncing back so quickly. Please keep on doing this channel. It's inspiring to hear your wonderful insights!
Wishing you all the best and please keep doing what you're doing!!
Nice to see you recovering so well. Avoid heavy metal as suggested.
Rick, so glad your surgery was so successful! Thank you for sharing this! Rock on!
Glad you're on the mend, Rick!
Welcome to the Heart Warrior (TM) Club. Glad to hear it all went well! Cheers Rick.
Glad to see you back on your feet. Keep well
Glad you're good to go. You're videos are too important to NOT exist. Mend well Rick!
❤
Missed the news earlier, but glad you feel much better! My prev doc said I have a leaky valve, and I do feel lethargic far too often. Harder to hold my arms above my head working these day. Perhaps I need a cardiologist to look into it. My own father had a titanium valve put in back in 86 at Loyola in Chicago, and heart issues run on both sides of the family. 😳
So glad everything went well! I’ve had nearly 50 years working in emergency health care (EMS and ER/trauma center), it’s great to hear a good report. As a bassist/vocalist, I love your material.  Keep it up!
glad you're on the mend Rick. Keep up the great work.
Given how messed up the US health care system is, it's nice to hear a success story. I wish others could have the great care and outcome you did.
Stay well Rick, love you man!
So glad to hear (and see) that you're okay!
Glad you are okay Rick - happy for you and your loved ones.
Rick- your content has meant as much to me as all the other maybe 7 or 8 thousand folks that have written you, so I won't re-invent the wheel. But, it has become invaluable by your interviewing folks like the live show guy, Eric Johnson and the Dan Alumni, as these show a side we would never ever see, other than on a very few channels like yours. Thank you- good health, Sir! ....and kudos on the Sting piece. He can be withering, I understand...
Great you're WELL !!!
Glad to hear you're doing good, to answer your question personally I love seeing the interviews
Hey Rick! It would be amazing if you could look at some of the music of Labi Siffre and Focus :)))
You’re freaking me out, man!
Rick, I and  all of us are glad you are OK… You take care.
Best wishes!
Welcome to the zipper club, Rick!
I am glad man!! God bless!!
Continued positive thoughts on a successful recovery.
Best wishes with your recovery.
Love you brother 🙌🏾🙏🏾🎸🎸🎸
You're the man.
Great to see you looking so well Rick - best for the recovery.
I wish you the best of luck!
Glad you are feeling better, Rick! Love your channel and would love to see more videos on producing songs and the process you go through as a producer and engineer to get radio-ready hits.
Yeah, you've lost weight
Cleveland is about one hour west of me.  What museums did you visit?  Glad you're feeling better!!
Good to see your recovery!
That's great news Rick, best wished from sunny England 🙃
Djeezes. You must be quite full of yourself when releasing a video about your health situation.
Glad youre doing well Rick
First, I'm glad everything went well. As someone a few years older than you, I'm wondering if it was a specific symptom that lead you to be tested in the first place, or if it was discovered in a routine checkup?
So glad you are doing well!
Be Well Rick. I love what you do.
Great to see you back on the channel Rick. Health and happiness to you.
Very happy to hear about your successful surgery. You have to stick around Rick. Your knowledge is invaluable. And, you are a good human imo
Keep yourself in check first but i love the interviews and i think the people you interview love it more and thats the sauce right there❤
You're 62 born in 1962. Cool!  LOVE your videos Rick. Sending healing prayers, thoughts and love to you Brother.
So glad you're on the mend. I think the history of various bands is interesting.  Learning how the individual members were influenced to create the specific kinds of music they do id fascinating.  Like the Sting interview you did which ifs where i pucked up the importance of studying Bach.
Hope you have a full and speedy recovery.
Glad to know you’re ok!
Glad you got this work done. Good luck going forward!
Rick, you're looking great! Take the time for a measured recovery - we'll all still be here for your brilliant videos. Take care man X
Love the interviews.
after those awful takes on modern music your heart just couldn’t handle it s/o modern science
Keep on keeping on Rick. Rock on!!
Wow you are tough man !
Great to see how you recover fast! Looking forward to upcoming videos!
Rick glad to hear that things went well, and glad that you are on the mend👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I am very glad to see yuo recovered Rick!!!! Looking forward for many more videos and interviews !!! Stay safe
Wishing you a speedy recovery.  Be well.  As far as videos go, I'd say dealer's choice.  I like the various types of videos you make.  So make the videos about stuff that's in your head and in your heart.
Congratulations on a successful surgery. So glad you are "back in the saddle." I'd love to see more "What Makes This Song Great" breakdowns. I learn so much about what I hear in the music I love, but am unable to articulate the "whys." Your knowledge and articulate breakdowns continue to teach me!
You have done an interesting work on behalf of music. Thank you Rick and keep doing it.
Saludos! Un descanso forzado pero necesario. Que todas las funciones y facultades físicas se estabilizen y regrese con todo lo bueno que nos comparte!
Wish you fast recovery and all the best ! Greetings from BG ! Keep on rocking !
Glad you are well!
Glad things went great! YouTube needs a lot more content like yours.
Woah - I had no idea 🙄  So glad you’re doing well, Rick! Very best wishes for a full recovery! 👍🙂
Do whatever makes you happy, Rick, and I will be happy.
glad your ok good info to share too, i'm just around the same age as you and that is scary stuff to think about
Rick, glad to see you're doing so well after surgery! Keep going man, love your videos. Would love to see more iconic solos re-imagined by yourself, those have been great!
Get well Rick. My Dad had triple bypass surgery in 95 and told him it would only last 15 years and the valves are still going strong 29 years later.
Stay healthy. And please give us more wmtsg. Best wishes from Dallas.
Happy days to have you well...
Wishing you the best of health Rick. Your videos are inspirational, as are you. Keep on rockin' sir!
Glad everything went well with your surgery and I hope you recover quickly. I love your channel, I love the interviews and I especially love your song break downs. I learnt quite a lot from them but their true value for me is to get to know music I otherwise wouldn't be aware of. So, keep those coming, for me they are a real treasure trove.
Ojalá puedas seguir compartiendo tu conocimiento, ideas y pensamientos por muchos años más! Gracias Rick!
Congratulations on your speedy recovery!  Cheers,  Alan Tomlinson
With way over seven thousand other people having posted all the sentiments that can be expressed in a situation like this, there's nothing very original left to say that can come from little old me. Nevertheless, I just want to throw my comment onto the pile to congratulate you on a successful surgery and to thank you for continuing to produce such entertaining and informative videos, especially on a video platform more famous for its 20-something fashion 'influencers' than its tenured rock 'n' roll professors. If I could even begin to come up with a complaint, it would be that you're probably getting too well-known, such that when I try to enlighten somebody by sharing one of your videos, I usually get told that they've seen it already!  Happy recovery, Rick, and keep up the great work.
My heartfelt congratulations to you!
So glad to hear you're doing better.  Cleveland Clinic is one of the best hospitals in the world to get work done, so you picked a great place.  Cheers and stay healthy!!
You are looking good Rick. Well done.
That's heavy duty ---- my dad had a 7 way bypass ----   i remember him being emotional after about the idea of his body being cut up------ He got a good deal and still going ---    IDEAS:   get a bunch of the same model cheap guitar under 200  on sale  ---- do a series      ----- like bottom Epiphone SG ---- Affinity Srat (i like mine) ---   Jackson js22 ----   ibanez  ----   LTD  ----  bigger brands only--------- take say 5 units -----  1.  look at the quality of the samples ---  (playing/sounding/setup/ups/downs/goods/bads/ uglies/etc.)  ----correct all issues or return to get 5 acceptable units that are mechanically  even-ish    2.   put a different  custom wiring setup from the various ebay suppliers ---- with stock PUPs  in each and compare,    3.   ID the 3 best cheaper pup options and try them on the winner of the 5.    repeat with next model    6.  After doing all the models you oplan,    compare the best guitars from each model ----- show all costs....    i think you should do only guitars with H H to make it an even comparison ---
Thanks for sharing this update with us - rest up and heal!
Glad you’re doing well, Rick. I enjoy your videos as a guy who started playing guitar kinda late and will never become a pro. But I just love it. I’m a family physician, by the way so really glad to hear that surgery went well
Glad you're feeling better Rick. Go Raiders!
make a video about "What makes this song great?" Blurry by Puddle of Mudd's  vocalist voice almost same  voice as Kurt Cobain.. also vocalist of Silverchair same voice of Kurt Cobain ..
Eat more animal products, pay pharma and doctors🤦‍♂
Great news, Rick. Keep up the good work.
great to hear your well Rick you look well
Speedy recovery !!!!!!!!!
Wishing you well!
Glad you are ok Rick, all the best and get well soon 🙏
👍
A fool and his Money is soon Parted!
Congratulations on a successful surgery Rick! Keep blessing lives!
Best wishes!
My sternum still hurts from surgery and its been 18yrs now, On X-ray it looks like a shirt that was buttoned on the wrong hole . Glad you`re faring well.
You look like you're in great shape! Keep up whatever exercises you do! Take your Supplements! Rock Hall had to be on the list!
Yep, the valve regurgitation is pretty common with us a little later in life. Had some major stuff done along with the replacement of my atrial valve 3 years ago. I spent 5 days in the hospital and about 12 weeks of healing and rehab. I have regular followup and one of the inner heart valves has slight regurgitation so...at some point, there will be another one of those surgeries. So glad your recovery has gone will. Stay healthy
Glad you are doing well.  Keep up the good work.
I am so glad for you! Prayers 🙏 for your continued health and healing 💗🙏!
Prayers for your healing offered.
Living legend Rick, long live Rick! Keep on rocking Rick! So happy to have you baaaaack!!!!
Glad you are doing well...take care!
So glad you're doing well Rick as I'm a busy General Surgeon who has enjoyed all your videos and discussions about song writing and glad to see you back. As our Healthcare system is the best in the world especially with respect to Cardiac treatment. As like your Surgeon, the ability to make a person's life better or longer is one of the greatest ways to spend one's life and learning music from you only enriches my life further. God bless
Very glad you were able to get the surgery you need to keep being the you we all enjoy!
Get well, man
Continued success in your recovery! I’m glad you are doing well! More What Makes This Song Great please!
Glad you're on the mend and feeling back to normal.   I love all your videos, but since you asked, my favorite are your interviews.  When it comes to music, I don't think there's anyone better when it comes to asking evocative questions. actually listening to what the interviewee is saying, and bringing reluctant individuals out of their shells.  Stay well and keep up the great content.
So pleased everything turned out ok.
Wishing you a speedy recovery, love & enjoy your content and passion
Glad you’re doing great!
Aww delighted all is well with ya !!! Thankgod ❤❤❤❤
you are the best, send my heart to you, speedy full recovery!
Praise God all went well and prayers for continued great health! 😉🎸🙏🏻
OUCH. We are glad you got it fixed. We will pray for continued health. That sternum cut.....wow...Great to see you back. Legend of the ATL. You need to make it like the Blind Boys, 90 and still playing.
🫵🏻👑
Speedy recovery Rick! 🙏
In the Christmas movie "It's a Wonderful Life", George Bailey finds out that he, not Mr. Potter, is the richest man in town. Not by monetary means but rather his impact on the community. You are that to all of us Rick. What you see is what you get with you. We are your community. I know now how important you are to all of us. Thank you for all the hard work on your channel. I am so glad you are back. Did I hear you say you walked nine miles? I have done 2.5 miles every day since my quadruple bypass in April. You are the man!
Rick, I am happy to hear that you are recovering so well from the surgery ! I really appreciate your channel ! You are truly blessed my friend . I was fronting a pretty good little 3 piece band in the Memphis area playing mostly the roadhouses in rural west Tennessee although we did play Beale Street and Hot Springs a few times . It's not easy to keep booked around here because there is talent everywhere ! I was diagnosed with mouth and throat cancer and wound up having my tongue removed . Musical career OVER ! I miss the stage more than you could ever imagine . You never know what tomorrow might bring so live each day as if it might be your last ! God bless you Rick ! After the years of watching your videos, I feel like I know you as a personal friend ! Good luck with the future of your life and channel ! Lee Williams ! AKA ( PAPA Willie) !
Glad you're feeling better Rick! I've really enjoyed the interviews and would love to see more.
So very happy your surgery went well and you’re on the mend!!
Glad you're well, Rick.  +1 for song reviews, please.
May God bless your recovery.  Thank you for your channel and music you share with all of us.
Im grateful you're on the mend and getting back to full strength soon!
I wish you a speedy recovery! Stay well!
Glad you're doing well Rick!  And honestly, whatever content you are interested in doing is fine.  Been following for a couple years and I still have a deficit of old videos of yours to get through so don't feel bad about not doing this particular type or that particular type of content!
Is your scar measured in fisherman  inches?
take care rick!
Best Wishes n All The love To Your New Jouney. ❤ I was Placed a Ring in my Artery in 2021 and Running Free.
So glad you are going strong. Blessings!
As far as I can see on the screen of my ipad, you look really great! I would never have said that you recently had an pretty major surgery….. Hope you like your “zipper”….😉🤭…… no offence, just kidding…hope to see you on this channel for many years to come! Thake care….! Say hello to your family fot me….they don’t know me, but still…….they are very lucky to have you as an husband and father!
So glad you’re doing well, Rick. There must be something about age 62…I had a widowmaker MI at age 62, coded, had my ribs broken during CPR, but had a stent rapidly placed and recovered fully. I hope you feel better than you have in years. I know I do. Now let’s make more music!
Feel  better Rick. My thought on the show. I myself like a mixture of both interviews and Song breakdowns.  Just do you brother.
Numbers 6:24-26      [24] The LORD bless you and keep you;      [25] the LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;      [26] the LORD lift up his countenance(3) upon you and give you peace.  Peace be with you Rick.
Self-care and managing your care with physicians is huge. Glad your recovery is going well!
So glad you're ok and recovering well. I'm probably most fond of your interviews but some of your song breakdowns were great. I've played guitar for 58 years. It's wonderful to hear smart musicians talk about music and the music business [as it was, is, and will be].
Love the channel and glad you're doing well! I'm a Cardiac Sonographer (I perform the echocardiograms) and it's certainly interesting to hear your story. Mitral regurgitation can be well-tolerated until you get into the moderate and severe cases, just as you said. Great thing is post-op is usually pretty great as the valve is now much more effective and the heart doesn't have to compensate for the volume it loses through regurgitation (left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial dilation), so you'll benefit from those no longer progressing and even start to return back to within normal parameters. After a while, you'll just have your yearly follow-up to see how the valve is doing and you're good to go!
WE LOVE YOU RICK! WISHING ALL THE BEST FOR YOU!!
A a Cleveland Boy, Born & Bred, you can do a darn sight worse than the Cleveland Clinic. Glad your procedure was “uneventful”. Hope you enjoyed our Museum’s. Keep up the excellent work and a continued “Uneventful “ healing   🙏👏🥂
More What Makes This Song Great(s). Glad you're out and doing well. So your issue is a leak. (So you care so much it oozes out, huh?) My heart issue is electrical (and I'm an electrician by trade. Irony? Haha. Left Branch Bundle Block is all I've got in stone.) Take care of yourself, Rick... and only push as hard as YOU feel the need. You've got a channel full of fans who look forward to whatever you post... and we can wait. ;) Glad you're doing great.
🎆Be well. Keep it good, and then TCB. Have fun as you enjoy each week of music..❤‍🔥🔥We all like you.
Glad you’re well. Love your work. Best of health!
All this new awful music can affect your heart. Dangerous to your health!
Good news......looking great 👊
Best on your recovery,take care.
Take care! Be well!
🤗
Thank you for the update Rick. I've been praying for you. I'm so pleased you are doing so well.
Prayers my friend! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Espero entiendas mi comentario en español , te admiro y te deseo y que  te recuperes pronto , desde Mexico mis mejores bendiciones  ❤
I am very glad to hear that thongs went as smoothly as they did.  You and your channel are awesome.  Perhaps more complete band songs.
All the best to you, Rick!
all the best to you Rick. Stay healthy
Get well soon Rick.
Get well soon
Stay healthy!!!❤
I came in contact with your channel, years ago, by the series "What makes this song great". i always watched this series with much pleasure (you had around 300.000 subscribers back then,.It certainly has grown!!😮). So, i would like to see more of that. But all your content is worth watching. i'm 60 years old now and like you, i always love all the music there is,..JazzRock, Hardrock, Indie, Pop, Hiphop, Classic, you name  it,.. Music is (one of )the most fine thing(s) in life..Keep doing what you do, and all the best with you health.
Phew, glad everything went well xxxx
Hope you're doing great - love your channel's, keep up the amazing work!
Good to see you looking well !
Congrats Rick. We never take for granted the continuous beating of our hearts. As for content suggestions, you always put out great stuff, most of which is over my head but you make it interesting.
Stay strong brother! Keep schooling the young and old!
I'm looking forward to many more years of the best content from you as usual. Keep Rollin´ Rick!!!
I'm so glad your surgery went off without a hitch! So no more heart stopping for a long time, OK? We need you!
❤ Ich war neulich so erschrocken als ich das Bild im Hospital sah und dachte, Nein, bitte nicht... Hab die Nacht vor der guten Neuigkeit sogar ganz kurz davon geträumt und musste dann nachsehen, zum Glück ist alles gut gelaufen. Ich hoffe das du unserer Welt noch lange erhalten bleibst Rick. War so erleichtert und glücklich zu sehen, das es dir gut geht.🍀❤️
God bless you.
So glad you are ok!
dude, your stressing me out. stoked your up and doing great, what else is on you tube to watch besides you? and i still suck, i need your insights, be well and happy healing . god bless
Follow your heart...it's always taken us in the right direction...good on ya'
Wish you the best for the fastest recovery.  You are doing such a great service to music and musicians.  Love everything you do on your channels.
Good to see you back and fully recovered, Rick! The heart is nothing to gamble with - great you did the right steps. All the best!
I'm glad that you received excellent medical care @ The Cleveland Clinic.  Be kind to yourself. I wish you and your family well in this season of life.♥
I’m glad you are doing better!
God is with you!  I am thankful for your update and hope for your patient healing.  On your request-how about reviewing music in more genres.  Country, Sacred, Folk and more.
Hey, Rick. Did you watch the Hired Gun musical documentary? What did you think about it ?
Hey Rick, I'm a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, guitarist, and big fan of yours. I'm glad your MV repair went well, and hope your recovery goes smoothly.
Loving the interviews. Learning so much about the history of music and the behind the scenes processes.   Think you can aim for the sky and get Flood on the channel? Doesn’t matter. After getting Brendan O’Brien, Butch Vig and Billy Corgan on you really did all that was ever needed for 90’s music. In fact, would love to see follow ups with all three of those within the next two years if possible.   I would say to aim for any of the PJ guys, but I think they’ve been interviewed enough and it’s better to concentrate on folks who haven’t done as many long-form interviews.
❤❤❤❤❤
Glad you are feeling better. Keep rocking, Rick!
Glad to hear you're on the mend, hope you're feeling tip top very soon.
So glad you are doing better
So glad you got your problem taken care of, Rick. Carry forward!
I'm glad you're doing well.  Keep doing what you do, it's all fun.
wish you good health
Rick, Today, I have had about enough of watching your videos and NOT fully supporting you. I am so grateful you are well and on the mend. I dont have time to learn much these days, but I have loved every video i have ever watched by you for 2 years, when my drummer turned me on to a tool video you did. Thank you for both your channels and the 3 marvellous references I just got from your Beato Bundle - great deal!  You are a comfort to this wildfire ridden Canadian from the Sub-arctic - among my peers you are a household name and deeply respected by every musician I know. I cant wait for some spare time this winter to deep learn from your great resources. Keep up the invaluable work, you are on my big and small screens every day.  I just wanted to thank you and let you know just how far north you are loved.   Franco
Speedy recovery and look foreword to what comes next on this channel.
Glad it went well Rick. Keep well mate !
I've worked in a cardiac ICU for over 10 years. The fact that you are already this recovered after mitral surgery with open sternotomy is really impressive Rick and a testament to you and your surgical team.
Rick, welcome back. Very glad you're feeling well and on the mend.  All the best
Glad to hear the surgery went well
Best of health to you Rick!  I believe you've made all of our hearts skip a beat with the interviews and song break downs.  Keep up the good work!
Rick, you look AWESOME! Good to listen to what the doctors have to say, but lemme tell ya, in 2010, they told me I would probably be dead by 2015.  So, take the good news they give you “to heart”, and the bad news with a, “0h ya? We’ll see about that.” Keep rockin brother!
Thoughts and best wishes to you ❤
All the best Rick!!!
Keep rockin' Rick.
Glad to hear you're doing well, Rick!
Rick, I'm so glad you came through ok!  I'm looking forward to seeing you in November, assuming you're in town!
Hey Rick. Thank God for modern Medicine! I’m 65 and haven’t yet crossed this threshold..you’re an inspiration..keep on keepin on!
and the beat goes on…. 🎉
Glad to know you're on the mend. Bless you and get back to what you do best!
Can you believe you've received sooo many comments of love and support.  Feel the love and enjoy it deeply.  Add mine. 56 y.o. guitar newby with a fresh pacemaker.
Glad you’re on the mend Rick. Stay well my friend!
keep on keeping on, Rick. So glad you are feeling well. I just got back from cochlear implant surgery. Same deal, more or less, go it get knocked out and wake up. I'm 50 and this only the second time in my life having gone under anesthesia. Heal up. I really like the interviews. Would love to have you interview Jacob Collier sometime.
FANTASTIC news Rick! SO glad for you and our community. You asked for our thoughts about the future of the channel. I'd love to know more about Bob Ezrin's work. All the best man!
If you're not supposed to lift over 10 pounds, I guess Les Pauls aren't your go to right now?  Stay well👍
Really glad that everything went well for you Rick!  Wishing you many more happy, healthy years!
Take care of yourself, Rick!!! 15 years ago during a routine checkup my doctor ran an ECG and looked and said, "hmmm, you've had a heart attack." 😮🤯😮 WHAAT? When? "Between the timd of your last ECG and this one." It was mild a mild one, sure, and a subsequent visit to a cardiologist showed there was no harm done, but also showed I have a condition that needs to be monitored and baby aspirin every day....  My dad had a quintuple bypass 20 years ago and became a stickler for heart health. We all thought in the end he'd be taken down by a heart attack. He passed away at 93 at the end of May from hospital pneumonia (surgery for a brain bleed went well) but it was his heart that held out to the last!! Miss you Dad! ❤
So happy it went well, Rick. Keep up the awesome work. Love from Chile!!
Godspeed❣ Keep it up!
I was pain free four days out of surgery. Back to normal in about three weeks with a full routine, and 90 days out back to normal in all regards. You will have a fast recovery!
Get well soon, Rick. I have mitral valve disease, so I can relate.
Good luck 👍🏻
Speedy recovery, Rick. Modern medicine is actually remarkable; welcome to the zipper club!
Great news. Going forward: More jazz; bossa nova; salsa; emerging serious musicians of all instruments including voice and percussion. Less on pop pablum and head banging crap of any era. I know that is part of your calling card, but you're better than that. You don't need to pander to the neophytes. It is their job to follow you. There, I have said it. It may mean less audience for you, but hopefully there is less stress there than pulling your hair out about autotune and Untalented Swift.
Hey Rick 👋, you look great for just having gone through that surgery. I had the same issue and surgery almost 3 years ago, at age 66. Love your videos, keep em coming! 🎶🎸🥁🎹😊
Thankful for your excellent procedure and recovery!!!  Looking forward to more what makes this song greats!!
I'm happy to see you ok and back. Your an ambassador of music culture, with the greatest  show on social media.
CONGRATS... enjoy every sandwich!
I wish you a great recovery, cheers from Brazil !
Get better ……there is still to much cool stuff to share with us. We need you around for a long time!!!
God Bless!
Rick , I had an aortic valve replaced two years ago. I suspect that the worst thing you do now is cough!
Good on you Rick. You're a tough cookie.
I love your channel, and all the enlightening views on  what concerns music and artists in general through the videos are something not to miss. Thank you so much for everything you do!
Love from Italy!
Hope you get well soon and recover in good health , Cheers from the Netherlands
Hey Rick... I just had triple bypass right before my 57th Bday to get ahead of a problem.  I binge-watched your videos early in recovery.  Great channel, great content from a great host... feel better, stay strong!
Rick, so glad you're doing well!  Your "storytelling" is always incredible--even when it's about a health update 🙂 I have a family history of heart disease, and while I'm doing well with no issues, as I just turned 60, your message is a reminder to continue to keep my eye on things in that regard.  Regarding your "reset" on your videos, I definitely like the song breakdowns a la "What Makes This Song Great."  So that's my vote!  Continued health and happiness!!!
I am glad you are feeling better Rick!
Glad you're feeling great and everything was a success. Modern medicine is really pretty amazing.
Glad to hear you’re doing good
Stay healthy Rick. I love You Man 😍❤
So you asked about future direction of the channel. I've always enjoyed your different analyses of various songs, but the shift to interviews has been very rewarding to me. While I've always been avid music fan and musician for a few years in school, I never had any knowledge of what went on behind the scenes. Theough interviews of musicians and producers, you've opened up a previously hidden world. Thanks for that and more please!!
The world is a better place with you in it Rick!!!!
Glad you're well Rick. Thanx for the videos.  FWIW my Mom had three mitral valves -- the original, damaged by rheumatic fever... a pig valve replacement... and a plastic one. She was healthiest with the plastic.
Awesome Rick.  We're so glad you are doing fine.  Mend up quick buddy.
god bless you man
keep on pushing!
Robin Trower....please choose one of his classics and do a breakdown on that. I miss the song breakdowns. PS....So glad your surgery was successful Rick.
Thanks for the update, Rick - you had us worried there. Rock on, man ❤
Glad you’re doing well Rick, the music world needs a lot more of your input. Keep on truck’in!
Glad you're on the mend, Rick!
Wow – so glad you're back. Wishing health, wealth and success. ❤
Have a good recovery Rick ! To answer your question about your channel, what is the most interesting on it for me are interviews of Great musicians like Steve Gadd, Keith Jarrett, Andy Summers, Michael Omartian, Vinnie Colaiuta and so on... Hope you will have the chance to do more of them. All the best Rick !
God bless you, Rick, in your recovery! Sounds like you're well on your way!
I've watched so many of your videos that you seem less like a YouTuber and more like a friend, so I'm very glad you're ok.  As far as the channel, I enjoy all of your content.  I'm a guitar player, so I eat that stuff up, but the breakdowns like "Kiss from a Rose" are fantastic as well.  If I could dream it'd be you and Jimi Hendrix in an extremely long and detailed interview shot over 3 days, but since that's not possible, I'll just await the next guest or song, which I'm sure will be fantastic.
Great to hear you’re on the mend, dude
💪
Great news--thanks for sharing!
Glad you’re doing well! You’re one of YT’s best content creators.
Give thanks 🙏 I'm so glad your surgery went well. your a good man. Please be well
This channel should be what you want it to be. Too cliche? I teach my kids the things you teach me, and the stories you share. I want them to know the name Rick Beato.
Keep away from the CLOT SHOT whatever you do.
GBU Rick!
God bless you, Rick.  Praying for your continued recovery.
More score breakdowns. Alexandre Desplat. Great to have you back healthy.
Great to see you back at the house and feeling good. Sorry you can't move any amps for a while though. LOL
Glad you're doing good. I'd like to see you cover more black artists especially in the "what makes this song great" category. You can start with Ella Fitzgerald's "Too Darn Hot" for this hot summer. Introduce folks to real singers and great arrangements. Tower of Power...Earth Wind & Fire...Prince's guitar work on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps."
WOW! The idea of having your heart and lungs kept going via machines while they repaired your heart is amazing. We are really blessed to live in such a time, and I have only heard great things about the Cleveland Mayo Clinic! Prayers for your ongoing recovery. May God bless and heal you Rick. 🙏All the best to you and your family! 💛😎
Congratulations for the happy ending! My vote would go for more white board episodes, please.
Thank God for Life
glad you are doing well
Be well young man!
Thank you for sharing your story. First of all you are a wonderful human with good works to still do. Glad you are getting better. Even if you have saved one life for sharing this, It is a beautiful thing. In thoughts and Prayers for full restoration in health and all other aspects of your life.
All the best Rick
Rick, so glad everything went well!! you look and sound great. And thank you for all of your videos : )
Godspeed man!
So happy you are okay! God bless and keep you Rick!
You gotta squeeze that heart pillow when you feel a cough coming.
Yay! They fixed you. Keep  dem interviews coming: NO ONE else does it like you. Godspeed.
Cleveland Clinic caregiver and Beato fan here. You came to the right place. Glad you're on the mend.
I m am glad you are recuperating well. Best
Your channel is perfect, don't change a thing!
Was wondering about your heart for some time. Having been there myself, I might even have posted a question in the comments. I've done that on a few YouTuber sites
Welcome back  your  acknowledge  is very  valuable
You seem to be doing great!! ❤
Glad to hear you're on the mend. I too have mitral valve problems, along with tricuspid and aortic prolapses. But because of my lungs and age, they can't help me. So it's only a matter of time. But I've had a long fulfilling life. And I'll keep playing my guitar and listening to Rock n Roll, and other forms of music.....Until the Musics Over. Please turn out the light. 😅 Thanx fir your channel. LedHed Pb 207.20 🎶 🎸 🎹
So glad you are ok after surgery, Rick. Keep well..
God bless you Rick, so glad to hear. Have a long extra blessed life as we need you down here
At 62 I had a triple by pass . 10 yrs later no problems . Your face has changed 😉 welcome to the club .
I've had two surgeries for an aortic valve and I've also got a long scar and I take an aspirin a day but otherwise all good. Mick Jagger and Arnold Schwarzenegger are also alumni of this. Welcome to the club; glad to hear you're on the mend ❤ 😊
Get well soon Rick
You're an international treasure Rick. Good to have you around.   In your last few videos you made an assertion that technology has made making music easy to the point that untalented people can make it, to the detriment of the music being made.  i was wondering if it would be a good idea to speak to someone who isnt adverse to using technology but has also made a distinct sound and possibly genre doing what he does.   In this case i mean Trent Reznor and NIN. Thanks for the consideration and its so good to have you around
Thanks for your presence on this planet.  And, I am so glad the surgery went well and you are feeling good!  ! VIVA la MUSICA !
Take care Rick! 😘🤗
Glad you are OK rick 👍
07/23/2024 0940 AM  Hey Man, Good to see you looking so well after your surgery. Be safe and we'll. Peace and Love.
Glad to hear all is well and thanks for sharing, sharing this type of event can help others who are going through something similar, and they see "hey it's going to be ok". On the idea thing, I'm been drumming since 1971, Keith Moon was my main inspiration for many years and I expanded into studying drummers instead of drumming, there's so much more to the art that way, than tabs, I started getting really into Little Feat, and then I noticed something, Richie and Keith play a lot alike, very freeform, obviously Richie is the superior drummer for many reasons, he stayed more with the groove and was consistent live. There's 2 songs in particular that showcase this , Hate To Lose Your Lovin and One Clear Moment, especially live, I don't mean to say they play exactly alike, but like Keith, Richie  creates patterns in verses and chorus, bridge, sometimes follows the groove, then the vocals, then the guitar, then bass, or plays around them, all in a rhythm, it made a lot of Who songs, just listen to the studio tracks and then the live versions on  Waiting For Columbus, there's some wicked drum tracks on that, Richie really deserves way more recognition and I think any drummer who wants to be the best they can needs to study him. Glad all is well,thanks.
great to see you well and healthy💙
Great to see you up and at it again, my best wishes to you.  Not able to lift more than 10lbs? I'm sure as someone else has probably pointed out:- you'll need to be careful with some of those Les Pauls! 😄😉😉😉
. Get well. You are a treasure.
So glad to hear everything went well Rick! It's great to have you back. Just keep doing what you're doing. Have a great day!
Glad to hear the surgery was a success. It's so nice to hear good news.
You mean you can't play a Norlin era custom for another few weeks?~!  Good on you Rick, I'm glad you're recovering well.
Stay healthy!
Glad to see you doing well! All the best wishes for continued health!
That's just great! You've been re-stringed, now up and running. Keep it up!
From another same-surgery recipient (me), well done, Rick! I'm so pleased you are doing great!
Fantastic, Rick..!  Great to hear the positive news.  Best wishes and continued success..!  ❤🎉
Just keep doing what you’re doing.  Glad your surgery went well.  The Lord bless you and your family.
My wife had the exact same procedure at the Cleveland Clinic on July 5th.   She's up and walking around, no issues.  Glad to see you're doing well
Glad you are well! Love this channel. Was in your old stomping grounds last weekend - visited the House of Guitars.
Wishing you all the best Rick! I had mitral valve repair minimal invasive surgery just over 2 years ago here in London. It also worked! Thanks to Roberto Casula and his incredible team along with all the nursing staff at Hammersmith.
I had a triple bypass on June 6th at St. Joe's hospital in Baltimore, it's known for its coronary unit. I turned 71 in May and had no idea this was in store for me. Same as you I felt tired and experienced some angina. At 71 I'll be going back to work on August 5th, eight weeks after surgery. Medicine today is a miracle. But my chest is a little sore. I wish you continued healing and stay strong!
Looking great Rick. Glad it all went well. Onwards and upwards mate!
Glad you're well, RIck.
Great news. God bless and may you do what makes you happy. Only seek peace it is all there is.
I’m glad to hear you’re doing good!
We wish you a good recovery!!! You are the best!
The worlds a better place with Rick in it.
A friend of mine had a similar operation. During his pre-op consultation, his surgeon asked if he had any questions............  Friend:  Doctor, will I be able to play the piano after my operation? Doc: Sure...... no problem! Friend: Well, that's odd. Doc: Huh, why do you say that? Friend: Because I can't play the piano now!  An oldie, I know, but hope it gives you a chuckle.    Best wishes for a full and speedy recovery!
Glad you are doing well. For the channel my thoughts are this, as much as I love the song breakdowns (the Batman/Elfman theme breakdown was amazing for me), I think you are an unmatched interviewer for musical peoples. You don't just ask basic career questions; you get into their philosophies and approaches. They even play a little bit!  Also, and maybe a huge reason is time. While it may be true that getting older and the increased clarity that comes with each passing year is an amazing thing, these legends may not be around for futures generations to probe and learn from in this more direct setting.   For example, I can listen to Beat It and hear the guitar riff and the solo, but without your interview I would not have known that Steve Lukather had to tone down the metal feeling on Quincey Jones's suggestion since the aim was to get on pop/R&B radio. This may seem artificial to some, but it is ok to write for a purpose.  I will watch your channel with whatever path you chose.
So glad to here you are well. That was major surgery.
I'm glad you're feeling better, Rick! All the best.
Rick, I am very pleased  your surgery went so well!
So glad to see you back!❤
Ça fait vraiment plaisir de te savoir guéri ! Meilleures pensées de France ❤
All the best to you, Rick. Happy for you to see you recovering quickly and to continue making interesting classy videos for hopefully many years to come. Thanks!
Best wishes for continued recovery. ❤️‍🩹
🙏 looking good Rick!
So so happy you made it Rick we still need you on earth 🌍 to continue your knowledge God Bless ❤
Glad to hear your good news, Rick. Love your channel and long may you continue
Glad you're recovering so well. Stay healthy man. Looking forward to many more years of your wisdom and stories.
Speedy recovery bro! You look great! You look strong. Blessings!   Channel comments? Do whatever makes you happy. Wethers its interviews, gear, stories, whatever, its all great stuff. I cant think of anything that would make it any better, and if It aint broke, dont fix it.
I guess lots of old cardio-vascular patients watch your videos, me included. Be careful of those blood thinners.
I'm glad your surgery was successful. God bless you Rick.
Stay well, boss. I love your videos! Get well soon (although it looks like your pretty darn well now!)
modern medicine is incredible.  I had dental surgery and watched the entire thing with my mouth wide open and the protective glasses on.... thank god for anesthetic. glad you are feeling ok, best wishes for recovery!
Great news about your health! Love your channel!
I loved “what makes this song great” videos. Please do more of those. Maybe even on how live versions compare to album versions (I almost always think live is better). Glad to hear that you’re feeling better. I love your channel.
"Have you tried turning it off and on again?" Rick did it and it was a success. Glad to hear that! 🙂
Best wishes, Rick. Glad it went well.
Best of health to you, Rick!!
Modern medicine is truly a GIFT to us all.
I wish you a speedy recovery 💤🙏
Best wishes rick,i had serious heart problems a few years back and have recovered well.wishing you the same!
Welcome to NE Ohio Rick. Were lucky to have the Cleveland Clinic in our backyard. Its no coincidence that NE Ohio IS THE rocknroll capital and the best heart care in the world.
So glad all is well. Be well, stay well!
All the best Rick. Speedy recovery. Enjoy all your post. Thanks Tim
Hello Rick, I had mitral & trucuspid repairs plus maze and left atrial appendage closure at the new Cleveland Clinic London UK in March 2023 (I was 76!), done minimally invasive by the wonderful Ranjit Deshpande and Max Baghai! I wish you a successful recovery - make sure that you do cardiac rehab which is very important!
I’m sure that was scary. Glad you were brave and took care of yourself. I love your videos Rick. Hope to run into you someday maybe at NAMM cheers 🍻
Good on you Rick.  I'm a veteran of 4 stents over 3 years and am now dealing with arthritis in my fingers which only motivates me to play guitar each day.  Game on.  I wish you a speedy recovery.
So glad you are ok Rick!  Prayers for a continued healthy recovery!
I’m so glad you’re doing so well after the surgery! I absolutely love your song breakdowns, that’s what drew me in in the first place. Keep on keeping on with the repaired beat keeper.
So glad to hear you're doing well now. Ditto on the National Treasure comment. I can't tell you how informative, enlightening, inspiring, and fun it has been watching and learning from your posts over the years. Keep on Rockin' and Talkin'. We love you and what you do.
Good luck Rick make a speedy recovery .
Get well soon Rick!! Love your videos!!
Love you Rick get well soon!
Glad you’re doing well!
Glad your surgery went well!   I thoroughly enjoy the interviews   even though I often have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to music theory.
Wishing you a speedy recovery!
Glad to here your okey. I'm 66 and don't even think about those things. Might be time for a checkup.
Wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery. CHEERS!
Congratulations on the successful surgery, Rick. Cheers to you and hopes for a super speedy recovery!   As always, I love your content. I always feel happy and educated after each one. Keep up the outstanding work, great music is eternal!  - TW from Minneapolis
Good news!!! Good for you, Rick ✌🏼🌻
Most importantly, have a good recovery.  Last thrusday, I had a cardiac arrest caused by coronary artery calcification (51 y.o. 38 years of smoking....dumb) Dying (the process of...) isn't too bad in hindsight. Having to go through that alone while waiting for the ambulance is terribly frightening though. When I had my arrest on the surgery table, it was like listening to an episode of The Muppetshow with Statler and Waldorf as the surgeons hovering over me. ("And there he is..." after the electroshock and heartmassage (first time I had ANY kind of massage). I got a stent now and have been under observation the last 5 days. Just returned home this morning.  My life is patched to version 2.0 now...😶‍🌫
I love the interviews. Keep them coming. And congrats on your surgery. Glad it was a success.
I was 58 when I had my open heart surgery. A well-known heart surgeon in Munich sewed two arteries - located in the thorax area - into my heart muscle, which had never been actively used before, as is the case with everyone. Today this is the main blood provision for my heart... for 18 years now and I am still working and living a healthy and joyful life...and enjoying your channel 👻
I wish you all the best, Rick! An open-heart surgery is a serious thing, yet you take it with a smile :) Greetings from Bulgaria!
I had a robotic mitral repair (annuloplasty) on March 20.  I've known it was coming for over 10 years.  My identical twin brother had the procedure in 2009, and he had a really rough postop course, so I delayed as long as I could..  I opted for robotic because my cardiologist told me how much quicker my recovery would be without a sternotomy.  But I have to say--you look amazing.  I certainly looked a lot worse a week later, and 4 months later I am still in cardiac rehab.  I do have 10 years on you. You're tough!
Glad to see you doing so well, Rick!
Rick you stubborn fool I am glad you are doing well my dad was not that Lucky
Truly a YouTube gem!!! Glas yur in the mends!!!
Get well, Rick! I am going soon for a second pacemaker, Rock On!
Welcome to the club, I had triple bypass almost 20 years ago. You are lucky your crazy glue incision will be hard to see. My brother had it also but his chest looks like a football. Keep up the great work🏈😊
Glad to hear it all went well and that you are recovering fast :)
Get well soon , we need you
Glad you're doing well.
I'm glad of hearing it. Greetings from Buenos Aires.
Glad you’re well Rick!
God bless, Rick,,,
So glad you are better. Love your content and helpful tips. I really enjoy the interviews.
Glad to hear you’re doing alright, Rick! I hope everything heals quickly and painlessly!
So glad you are ok, Rick!  Thanks for sharing your story.
Great to see you back and looking good!
Rick, just continue to do what have always done, it's all good. Most important that everything, is to take care of you first. We will always be here with you. I believe that you know this, just need to tell you, along with 4.35M other subscribers
Glad to hear it went so well! Love the content!
My dad had the same surgery 3 months ago for the exact same issue (mitral valve regurgitation) and it was not quite as successful as yours.  He's still with us thankfully, but he almost wasn't.  The first valve repair failed so they had to keep him under anaesthetic and open him back up, then they struggled to restart his heart after the repair was completed.  Following the surgery he developed necrotic pancreatitis which very nearly killed him.  He was in a hospital bed for about 2-3 weeks after the surgery, and he's only started to become more active again in the last month or so.  It was a very scary time for us so I'm glad to hear it went well for you
Glad you’re well, Rick! And a shout out to science and modern medicine!
God be with you.. You stay healthy man.  A big Hug from all of us.. Thank you Rick.
Hope your doing better buddy
Glad you are well.
Wishing you a speedy recovery Rick! So glad you are doing well! All the best & thank you!
More song breakdown please Rick and best wishes for your recovery
Great news to see you're OK 👍 🎸🔊🔥😎
We're glad you're ok. Please continue forward with all your good videos.
All the best to you, Rick.  We are all pulling for you.
Glad to hear you are doing well!
Great stuff!
Rick, I had mine done in 2003, I'm sixty-nine, now, and it's still clicking away (mine's titanium) Welcome to the zipper club!
Awesome Dude👍. Full recovery in GODSPEED!!!
Isn't medical science wonderful...pity the US hasn't got a medical system that is for the whole population   Congratulations on the successful op
Glad you're ok, RIck! Keep up the great work!
Just giving you blessings,Rick🙏🤘🏻
Fantastic news Rick, I'd say get well soon but you're already there.😊 New chapter looking forward to.
we love you Rick, i learn a lot from you. What you bring out on your 2 channels is allways good, because your a pro, with a good fresh heart  Different genres of music is allways good.
Hi Rick…big fan here!   Not a musician but just a simple amateur music listener.  Have learned so much from your videos about music history and such.  Glad your surgery was successful!
Love the song breakdowns, never stop, congrats on the new valve.
Jean jacket on again means you're ready to rock again! Happy to hear you're feeling better Rick!
Wow glad it was an easy fix, keep making those videos
Best wishes for a speedy and complete recovery...
Congratulations, sir. Best wishes.
Take care Rick , don’t go too fast , give yourself some time.  Looking forward when you are back on track💪🏼  All the best ,  Vincent from Amsterdam
Rick love you man please take care of yourself. I had a pacemaker implanted recently and I know all about cardiologist visits. Be well my friend be well.
You are a joy, Rick Beato! 😊 So happy you are healing well! 💖
Your knowledge, content, love of music is admirable. Hope you stay healthy & inspired. Wish you success in your personal journey, go as deep as you can 🙏
Glad to know you are doing great Rick. The content you put for the world is just so inspiring. ❤
So glad to hear all is good. As far as the channel .....keep on , keeping on. Thanks for the update.
I'm glad you came out of your surgery so well. I think there is a side effect though, you are starting to sound like Christopher Walken when you speak.
❤all the best from the U.K.
I had no idea you had this problem but I'm extremely pleased to see you doing so well, huge appreciation for your marvelous surgeon too. As for the channel I always look forward to your interviews, it's the purest form of entertainment, someone with an exceptional talent being allowed to tell their story by someone asking the right questions. What could be more interesting? Of course some guests will appeal more than others depending on individual taste, but even then it can still prove fascinating. You keep doing it, I'll keep watching. Here's to your good health!
Wishing you a speedy recovery, Rick. Watching you from Portugal and listening to the Wilson sisters now on your behalf 🫀😉
Glad to hear that you are on the mend, Rick!  Love your stuff and I'm happy to know that you have more energy now!
GREAT to hear you're now 'fixed' Ric ... keep on making your videos ... lov'em ...  And ... I'm sure whatever content you decide on for this year. it will continue to enlighten me 🤓
Don't change what ain't broke. :)  And it's great that you are feeling good after the surgery!
Glad you're doing so well! For me, your long form conversations are the best. You are building an amazing archive. I've learned so much from people I had never even heard of before. A treasure indeed. Thank you for being and staying here.
Rick I am so happy that you are well now you are a great guy & very knowledgeable we all love you & your videos & we all care for you thank you so much for the interesting videos  keep them coming
Get well Rick.  Keep the videos coming - both song breakdowns and interviews.
That is awesome Rick,i to suffer from heart problems,but im doing great,stay strong brother,love your channel.
Great that you're up and running again after an open heart surgery. For the future of your channel, I'm interested in all the things you do, whether it's interviews, song breakdowns, views on the current state of the music industry or anything about guitar or drums. Love all! Thnx Ivar
Praying for your continued health Rick... RE: Channel love your interviews. Especially with film composers. Maybe some film sound designers too? Since in modern film making there's a very fine line between score and sound design. Keep strong!!
Take care Rick, You have become a regular friend on here. It is important work that you do and we love you for it.
More interviews! I would love for you to interview Leon Sylvers III, Sheila E, The O'jays or The Whispers!!
Glad your back on top Rick and feeling great. Not sure if this would work how about a Motown series Just a thought.
Get well Rick . . .no more salt, sugar, noodles, margarine, cheese. . . . . .buy an ultra-light guitar.. . .no more Les Pauls.
thank you  and Stay healthy !
That is fantastic news! We've never met but everyone on here feels like friends. Sharing ups and downs. My son and I love your channel and are happy you are through this and the better for it even! God bless and keep up the incredible content!!
Long live Rick !!
Blessings, Rick!
Glad your on the mend Rick.  Keep Rocking!!!!!!
Glad it's all over and you're fine. I guess it must be such a relief! Direction? Speaking for myself it couldn't be better. Love the interviews. Shows the humanity behind the legends you talk to. More of that please.
Excellent to hear, Rick. Seriously glad to hear it was a success. I can't begin to describe the impact of what you've been doing for music and therefore our lives. No one gets us the details like you do.
God bless you Rick.. Get better fast! Enjoy your life and thank you for sharing with us.
Very happy you're doing so well. Pray your recovery will be complete.  You're a blessing to us all.
I am glad you had a successful heart surgery and wish you a speedy recovery.  I love your videos and the great musical guests that you have on them.  Thank you for the update.
So glad to hear all went well! God bless and rest up be well.
Hi Rick wishing you a speedy recovery!!  I had mitral valve repair at the Cleveland Clinic over 12 years ago.  Amazing Dr’s, nurses and staff there!!
Love your work, Rick. Why not perhaps redress the lack of recognition for women musicians who've influenced our lives, and especially those we might not realize had a big influence on us, please? For me, Carol Kaye, Joan Baez, Grace Jones, etc. Certainly here in England we're bombarded by "man bands", and some of those even don't consider themselves as that, which is even funnier. I'd love to see what you can conjure up, and inspire and inform us with! Thank you!
Thank God everything Came out good.
I am glad you are back😊
I miss the What makes the song great pieces.
I am so glad you are OK. Keep it up, dude!!!
Wish you well! We love you down here in Israel. ❤
Glad everything went smoothly, Rick.  Take-away for everybody, get regular check-ups and exams so stuff like this never catch you off guard and you immediately know when something’s up when it starts.  Be like Rick; not only when it comes to things musical.
Good luck to you Rick. I had a quadruple bypass three years ago, I'm brand new now.
we glad to see you this healthy rick
First and foremost, thank God you are well, up and almost running....Great work. New stuff? Well, there are things that could be interesting as a side note and curiosity...instead of making lists of "The Best 100 or Top 10's, imagine if you make the subscribers or viewers of the channel make a bracket challenge of Best song of all time, best guitarist, etc. Another thing could be called as "Side by Side" (looking at songs that were covered by another artist and what made this new version so special). You're interviews must continue. I think also if you made you're own "award show of the year" (not a Grammy or AMA version), rather 5 to 10 songs or albums that really captivated you by certain standards. Keep up the great work.
Best wishes to you Rick. I have been watching you for years. You are a credit to music and education in the industry. Long may you continue.
Be well. love your channel
Quit listening to the modern top 10: it'll give you a heart attack. 🤣  But seriously, you're in a great system (Cleveland Clinic). Stay well.
So glad you're doing well
Glad you’re good. I have mitral valve prolapse and apparently I have to get it replaced in the future. Medicine has come a long way.
Glad everything was successful and you feel better. The interviews are the most interesting anywhere, 60 mins don't got nothing on Rick. But I'd love to see you more in the studio, the Engineering and Production stuff is interesting to me
Stay healthy Rick. Love from Norway
Sometimes if you drink vinegar it doesn't leak
Typical severe MR symptoms; as a cardiologist I wouldnt have said that, you did not show the so called “mitralic facies” (at least watching your videos, directly face to face is all another story). Take good care and have periodic check ups , check your pulse frequntly (best if with a wearable that can detect AF).
Direction of the channel :- Id like to see anything you're passionate about!!! As obscure or as popular content as you'd like as long as it lights your fire.   Do you still have any students? Would be great to see you show off your students and their musical work.   Also, I know you have a varied international audience, would there be some way for you to do react videos to bands / artists only familiar to certain fans? For instance have you ever checked out these Australian bands?:-  Middle Kids... Led by enigmatic Hannah Joy and her bassist / producer husband.  I adore this band nearly any song is a classic. Try "Tell me something" or "bad neighbours" <- gorgeous singing.   "Bootleg firecracker (midnight piano version) "Your love"     Gang of youths... Almost theatrical rock.  "Deepest of sighs, frankest of shadows"  Violent Soho :- hooky riffy grungy heavy rock band. "No shade" "covered in chrome" "saramona said"  British India. Angst unique Aussie band tried and true from the late 2000s, still making good stuff:-   "Absolutely disgusting" "God is dead (so meet the kids)" "Blinded" (my favourite break up anthem) "Tie up my hands"   Gerard J Holmes... Disclaimer! I know this guy haha, good stuff though.   "Kinder things" - lovely, heartfelt track "I'm a fool" - great brooding masterpiece "Monsters" rap, a legit plea to live life  The Middle East... I think you would love this band Rick if you haven't check em out.  "Blood" (just one of the best songs ever written and recorded imo) "Lonely" "Deep water" - again, one of my favourite songs ever  Anyway I could go on for ages that's my recommendations! :) everyone check it out if you're curious
excellent!! god love ya brother.. glad your doing well.
Now I want that surgery too!  Glad it went well!
After years of consistent WMTSG, I understand why you don’t make them as regularly anymore, but I would selfishly still like to see them once per month or every couple months
Rick, I'm so glad to see you come through this successfully! You're in my prayers. 😇🙏
Glad you are feeling better Rick. You videos are great.  Best wishes from Tony here in the  UK.
I had the exact same mitral valve issue when I was 45. Thankfully they could do a non-invasive side approach so it didn't require a zipper on my sternum., but still a 10-hour surgery . Here I am 12 years later and doing fine. I'm sure you'll be the same and feeling up to par in no time. Best wishes for a complete recovery.
Glad you're recovering well. The world needs more people like you.
All the very best for continued healing Rick.
Best wishes to you and your family. Perhaps take a break from shouting at the clouds 💜
Glad all went well.
Rick I'm a musician from Newfoundland. I love your show . It carries me when I need inspiration.. Thank you. Glad you are in good health these days, cheers musical brother..
Looking well now!
You luck great, buddy. Continued success and health! Get back to Cleveland to see us when you can enjoy it a bit more 🙂
Always praying for you Rick!!! Love from the UAE
All the very best there with recovery from Sydney Australia Rick. I love watching your interviews and everything you do here on your channel. The up close and personal interviews with the world's finest musicians are fascinating, along with what makes this song great. ❤, keep playing, 🎸and keep playing more. 🎼,
Take care, Rick, and stay healthy.
If my eyes open in the morning, it’s already a good day.  As Rodney D. said about his heart surgery, I’ll either be out in 4 days or two hours.   I laughed.   Glad you made it RB.
Rick I hope you recover soon and well 😊
Stay strong Rick, don't scare us!!!
You look great for just having surgery! Here's to a speedy recovery!
God bless you and your family — you are a good man.❤
All the best for you and a fast recovery, Rick! Best wishes from Germany 🍀🍀🍀
Glad you are on the mend.  It would be great if you had a segment, or 3rd channel (??) devoted to new, unknown artists/bands that you and/or your team scout/get word of. Having them perform 2-3 songs, with interviews to get to know them. Its like bringing back the old ways within the new ways. I contacted you about this (your web).
did you get a pig valve?  My dad had the same surgery in 1976 and it took the better part of a year to get back to where you are today.
Hi Rick. Fellow heart patient here. As long as we can play guitar?... Right?
Glad you're having a great recovery!!!  Best wishes for the rest of the recovery journey!
Love your videos Rick! Glad you’re doing well!
Glad to hear you’re OK, and thank you for sharing your experience.
Now, are you sure none of your guitars weigh ten pounds? Double neck Gibson? Twelve string bass? 😄 Seriously, I'm praying  for your complete recovery, and more videos to come!
Dear Rick, I am very happy to see you again and looking forward to your new videos. I wish you all the best in health and when you come in Cyprus sometime, we meet and play 🎸 together😊
Happy to see you back Rick.
Blessings from South Africa
That's amazing that you're walking around and able to do some things. We're all glad that you're doing OK Rick. Amitofo!
Happy to see you like that , Take Care Rick 😉
So Glad your procedure wad successful.  I'm from Cleveland and The Cleveland has grown to a World leading hospital as you  know.   Just Glad you're doing so well.  Gosh 1 week out too 😊😊
I have loved the interviews
Glad to hear you are recovering well, Rick! I’m a family nurse practitioner, working in health care for 45 years! I love how you break down songs into their different phrasings and chord progressions! Your musician interviews are insightful and you can see the respect you have for their work! Rock on!
my Dad had heart failure in his late '60s and later in life Alzheimer's late '80s. He was my hero, people love you I think that helped him immensely He was a good man.  I just ran out of words.  All my best thoughts.
God bless you, Rick, and your excellent medical team. You look great, and we appreciate your personal update regarding your positive results.  I don't believe in coincidences, per se, and believe God guided your healing. Love your channel, man. Best! 🎸🎶🤗
song breakdown :   burning heart   ,  vandenberg         😊
Im glad everything went well, and you are healthy. ❤️
Answered prayers indeed! God is good. Continued prayers and blessings to you and your family!
Glad you are recovering well. :)
All the best, Rick. Thank you for the wonderful music content and keep up the good work.
May 20th I had a Valve replacement and double bypass. I know how you feel. Been drumming since 1975 and it's a long haul in recovery. Just turned 65 last week and in rehab. Take it easy man.  The first few weeks were awful. I only play guitar now till I feel like I can actually load a kit and perform. GREAT Channel Rick.
Best wishes dude 🤞👊
also, still hoping you will do some content on the Stones, maybe a breakdown of their great new song Angry?
Stealthy healthy Rick
I am glad you are doing well Rick, as Neil Young sang, long may you run!
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
So stoked you're okay! Check out the recovery time, man! Less than a week and you're back in the studio! You absolute warrior! I had a tumour removed from my head, and honestly, it was insanely easy to go through - as you said, I was out, and then back. All done.
So glad it went well. Your channel is SO appreciated.
Keep strong and healthy!
Rick I am so glad you have had such successful surgery and are back on deck. Your story touches me so much as someone who comes from a family who have heart problems. Like you my excellent health care and healthy life style have managed these challenges so we can enjoy our loved ones, music and what life brings to us all. Keep creating, playing guitar and seeing your kids grow up 😌 You are a treasure keep on rocking 🎸🤘
You look great Rick, I'm very glad for you, thank you always! ❤️🙏
Am delighted you are OK Rick.
You'll be OK. Seem quite fit. You might have to watch out for being out of breath sometimes. Look up simple rerhab exercise programs. Watch out for stairs. Heart docs and teams are incredibly interesting. Be well.
I am glad that you are doing well Rick! You look a little lighter but look great.
Take good care, Rick!   Bless you!
Noooo pain 😳
My father in law had the same surgery and after that it was like he had upgrated his heart. 😅 After a while you will feel the same. Be safe, we need you.
Glad all is well Rick, you asked, I'd love to see more WMTSG videos, in particular more modern stuff, Textures-Awake, Haken-Cockroach King, AIC-Drone, Soilwork-The Thrill, to name a few...and probably a hundred more great songs that others would list.
Happy to see you’re doing well! Wish you a speedy recovery Rick!
Hey Rick, I'm glad to see you're doing well after surgery! I hope to hear you continue the great work!
Delighted to hear that you are so well ❤💚🇮🇪
Great to hear you’re on the mend (actually mended!). Love the channel. Song breakdowns, interviews, and editorials on what the industry is going are all great. Also loved the family bass story. All the best.
Rick you're an international treasure! I'm 34 years old, I'd happily hope you outlive me mate, give us another 40 years please mate <3 love from Australia
Best wishes and many new videos❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Guitarist and anaesthesiologist from Croatia
Bentall Procedure FTW! 😆
Take care man, hope you get well soon.
God has been blessing You one more time!
First of all - stay safe and healthy! We all need you Rick! As for content: I've always loved the eclecticism, never sure what genre/artist/technique you're going to focus on with each video. It's not too banal, I hope, to say that it's the CONSISTENTLY HIGH QUALITY of your output which distinguishes you in a crowded market and draws the audience into your world.    That probably doesn't help! So, ok, more song breakdowns please, but always interspersed with your interviews. It's a wonder you haven't been poached by mainstream channels (terrestrial/cable), given the calibre of musicians you attract, knowing they will have an intelligent and entertaining conversation with you.  Keep well!
Thank God 🙏 all went well and your back and firing on all cylinders again. ❤
Mate...you get the interviews we want. No one else is even close. Your interviews will be your lasting legacy !
Wishing you a speedy discovery Rick!
Cleveland Clinic is a great place.  I may be going there myself before the end of the year.  Good luck with your health.
amazing surgery amazing recovery all the best Rick
Glad it went well Rick. Great to see you back 😎
So glad the surgery was successful.  All the best to you.
Greetings from Montpellier, France! I've been a subscriber to your channel for a few years now and enjoy every vlog you post. Stay strong and healthy, Rick, and I look forward to many more great videos. Lisa
God bless you Rick, you keep going strong!
Wow. So glad to see you doing well, Rick. Much ♥ from Australia.
Wish you good health, owe a lot of knowledge to you. Thank you.
glad you're back on your feet!
Doctors are exceptionally good at what they do, glad it went as smooth as it could. Best of luck with the recovery.
All the best to you.  Don't be playing any heavy guitars (Les Pauls).  Ha ha
My thoughts on the future of the channel, for what they are worth.........Keep Going! Although my technical knowledge of music is zilch, and I haven't got the patience to improve it, I get a lot of enjoyment from listening to you and hearing your views. Intelligent and articulate channels are a rarity in these times of instant gratification and lowest common denominator content, so keep doing what you are doing. I wish you all the very best for the future.
Best wishes, Rick 👍🏻
Dear Rick, stay healthy and best wishes to you, your loved ones and your channel. As for the way forward, I personally really enjoy the interviews and understanding the creative and musical composition process of different artists, as well as the breakdown of songs along with musical analysis. Best regards from Germany.
🎶❤🙌🏻
Good to be alive! So glad you are with us. How lucky we are🎉
Wishing you a successful and speedy recovery Rick!
Great to see you up and about❤🎉
Glad you're doing well
Wishing you the best
Best wishes for a full and speedy recovery Rick!
II have MVP also. I’ll discuss this with my cardiologist.
All the best mate.
I'm happy to hear that you are doing good. Was a bit worried when I saw the post around the surgery. But glad you are recovering well! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Jesus, thank God everything went well!!! Wishing you all the best Rick!!
Glad to see you back looking and feeling good. God bless
Best of recovery Rick! They must be good drugs if you're up and about so well already!! :D
Rick, So glad everything with your health has been improved. The folks at the Clinic are incredible.  Luv your channel and believe you are incredibly musically talented.  Keep breaking down music and doing interviews.  I enjoy all of it !
Great to hear that everything went well Rick.  You are one of the few YouTube creators that when I see a new video I almost always stop what I'm doing and watch it from start to finish.  God Bless you brother and wish you nothing but smooth sailing for years to come.
Stay healthy, and thank you!
Looking great for 62! I’m 56 and take medication and have had surgeries for a heart arrhythmia. My only symptoms were exhaustion during exercise. Glad your surgery was successful!
So glad it worked out well! Stay with us Rick, you're a bright shining star on a cloudy and dark internet! Looking forward to many more interesting videos in the future.
Can't lift over 10lbs? Be careful with any old Les Pauls you own 😉
Glads you’re ok Rick. 🙏
Best wishes for a quick recovery!
I wish you well.I've had fun with my health too and will be seventy in a few weeks.You're channel is very inspiring.I have spent most of my life playing guitar.Keep up the great work.
Rick, you have given so much joy and musical knowledge the past few years. I love what you do. I wish you a speedy recovery.
Glad to see you recovering well, Rick. All best wishes for your continued good health. Take good care, be happy & well!
Speedy recovery Rick.
Glad you're feeling better brother
Love you, Rick! ❤
Glad that everything went well. I’m happy for you.
Wait do u live in Cleveland?! Sorry not trying to be creepy
God bless you Rick and keep healing.
Godspeed Rick, hope to see you soon @ 100%.
Good news. So pleased for you Rick. A few years ago had my own brush with the Reaper and had a stint in ITU and a long rehab afterwards, (I was 59 at the time and now 64) but was out and about and gigging again 6 months later. Despite more surgery since I am still getting out there, so really good to see you have also recovered so well. Your channel is a never ending ray of sunshine and long may your health continue to be good ❤
Good to see all went well, Rick !! Best of health to you !!
Glad you’re doing so well. Love your videos.
Hope you have a successful recovery.
Go carnivore, Rick! It fixes everything.
Rock on Rick! 🌟
Glad you’re ok Rick.
Thumbs
Rick, glad you are doing well.  Hope you have many more healthy years ahead of you.
Rick, you are the best. I wish you a quick recovery and good life and more videos. Be well dear.
Show us great songs you like Fast recovery!
Thumbs up, Mr. Rick, Keep on keepin'  on
Wishing you a speedy recovery!
It's good to know that Rick isn't an alien, and in fact a real human...some of us were wondering! I'm glad everything went well! I can't speak for others, but I enjoy immensely the interviews you do, and not just with artists. The engineers and producers that you interview really add to the life of the music. If you could find some of the women that really kept the music machine rolling to interview, that would be epic! You know, the secretary that smiles, got coffee, (and everything else) and ripped people new buttholes when they screwed something up, they are the real treasures to be interview as they know all of the dirty little secrets!
Glad it went well!
Thank you for letting us know that you are Fine. I started watching your videos long ago , and i was amazed when you did a video on Martha Argerich The pianist from my Country. Love your Videos Rick. All my love from Argentina , buenos aires city.
It is an incredible recovery !... I got a mitral-valve reparing 10 years ago... one month after the operation I was unable to walk or talk normally!!  despite the fact i am a sportman... congrats for such a health you have!
love to U man .
I'm glad you made it through that with flying colors.  Heal quickly and completely, Rick.
Rick: I’m glad everything went so well. Best of luck from here on.
Best wishes Rick, I hope you recover fully and feel better 👍
Glad you are on the mend!!
Wishing you well Rick! 💛
I had open heart surgery to repair my bicuspid valve in 2021 (I'm 35), but it didn't last, so they had to replace it after just one year. Both times, I needed 3 months to return to normal.  How the hell are you even walking or recording videos, Rick? 😂 The chest pain, the broken bones, the fatigue—all things that it seems you're not experiencing.  Glad to see you're fine, though! 🤘
Your interviews of musicians are the best I've ever seen.
G'day Rick. Grant here in Hobart. Great to see that your back on deck and all went well. I like the idea that your asking us fans how you should run your channel. I have been watching since the start and I love the format with maybe a few more 'what makes this song great' shows. I do have an idea on how you might take everything a step further. I'm over 50, I agree with you ( as many do) that the music industry today sucks. Not just in the USA but Australia and many other countries. Rick, could you have a quiet word to some of your friends in the industry for them to donate studio time to an unknown rock band who, along with many others worldwide, sent you or your friends a few of their best original songs for a competition you could set up    To help the rock industry, and it needs help right now. What do you think?. Grant
I'd like to think they open your sternum before they stop your heart :)
Take time to recover. We'll be there and can wait.
How is your mental health? I imagine it’s been an exhausting few weeks
I'm terrified because I'm sitting in the hospital waiting to have the same thing done..
Welcome to the zipper club!
So 2nd life... died and resurrected... ;-)
Glad your surgery went well, Rick. Take it easy..🎸
My Dad's valve got so damaged from chemotherapy that the hospital refused to do the surgury because they said he would never make it off the table alive. He went to the Cleveland Clinic and it went fine. If he had just took their word for it he would have died before 6 months were over.
stay healthy!
Our hearts gave us humans our first primal sense of rhythm/pulse/beat. May yours let you keep pumping-out new videos and drumming-up new ideas for them. (Keep on enjoying life with family and friends along the way!) Peace!
Take care of you rick we need you❤
Love from russian viewers! We are all people loving the music. Get healthy, Rick!!!❤
Please keep save and healthy! Many more years to follow!
All the best to you Rick.
I'm just glad we get to enjoy more of the musical Rick Beato Firehose of Knowledge and Feel!  But of course, I'm glad you are OK too. 👍  And I'll leave the channel direction to you, you've done a pretty bang up job so far!
Best of health to Rick Beato!
so stoked your ok bro..
My wife had the same surgery … about 5 years ago… she’s fine
Stick around Rick. We need someone like you in our lives
Great that your recovery has been surprisingly quick. Plus it’s a prompt to thank you for the great interviews, it’s clear the musicians enjoy your genuine questions. I do have a request/suggestion, how about an interview with Brandi Carlisle or Bonnie Raitt or another female guitarist?
Great to hear the surgery went well, Rick! I just love the videos and  interviews you do! Best wishes from 🇸🇪
Welcome o the zipper club.
Glad you are feeling better RICK. Blessings.
Rick, glad you are doing well 👍
Live long and prosper. You’re the best!!
Thank you, Rick. All the best.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
More of what makes this song great
So glad you're alright... all the best wishes!
Getting surgery is a bit like a sound wave isn't it? Attack, Sustain and Release :-) It was a big deal, but like all professional musicians, you got back in tune and made it look easy. Bravo.
All friends and followers here say  you're a national treasure, I say you are an interational treasure, take care man!
So happy for you Rick ! Glad you found the right doctors.
Nothing over 10 lbs, you better stay away from the les pauls lol. Heal quickly! Love your channel.
Good stuff
Rick... glad you're on the mend. Looking forward to more great videos on your channel!
Happy to hear you're fit again !
Great news, glad to here your doing well! 😊
62 ! Music is the best elixir of youth, you look great !!! and I would say :  you're an INTERNATIONAL treasure... music needs you.
Wonderful news! The elation in your voice says volumes.
Rick, I'm glad to hear you're doing well after such a significant surgery. I'm 43 years old with a 3-year-old son, and reading your message has reminded me how fortunate I am to have good health. It also gave me an internal reminder of what I need to do to take better care of myself. This way, I can hopefully look after my loved ones for a longer time.  Thank you!
I am glad to see you up and about Rick. Can't wait to see what you come up with next on your channel.
Stay well, mate!
Looking Good. Respect. Thank you for the update, stay away from auto-tune!
u are pretty much the greatest thing
I'm happy for you that the surgery went so well. Take care and have an excellent convalescence. :)
Good to see you doing well after your surgery, Rick! ❤ 🎶
All the best wishes Rick! I am very happy to see you get better. Take care!
Best Wishes from Hong Kong! Happy to see you're on the mend!
Bon Rétablissement!  Have a Good Recovery! Thank for all your videos.🎼🎶🎶
Great to hear Rick. I'm really pleased to hear that you are on the mend and recovering well from the operation.
take care man
Glad you're doing well. Love your interviews.
So glad it was successful, that you feel well, and that the whole thing is behind you.  Be well!
I hope you have a speedy recovery.
remember "never give in never give up!" get well and a full recovery and remember rest some times and don't burn the candle at both ends. one last thing welcome back!
So glad you are ok. As I said before I had a heart attack and had 5 bypass surgery. I have found some slight troubles in getting my hands to play guitar like I once played and to sign my name but all together I am right as rain. Pay attention to your body.
Glad to hear you are recovering...🙏🤘
Good man! Now cheer yourself up and watch Robert Plant and Alison Kraus at Glastonbury in 2022 performing When the Levee Breaks. I would love you to review that and I guarantee it would do your heart good.
Good, now you can do interviews and WMTSG for another 62 years. 😀
Best wishes for your continued speedy recovery, Rick! You are a gem and you will be stronger and better!
I wish it the best of luck and I didn't really. Comment on your first post because it brought back a memory. You looked like my father Late father laying there God bless Rick❤🇮🇹🙏🌹
Glad you are OK Rick! keep on ramping up to greatness!
Much love, Rick... Much light to your health. Keep up your fine work.
You've come through some heavy duty surgery and must take whatever time is necessary to fully recover.  We'll be here!!
welcome back in health !
Glad you're doing well. If one deserves the best it's you!
hey welcome to the Zipper club! - I also had my sternum split and had my aortic valve replaced with a mechanical valve back in 2016.  The worse for me was the sneezing - felt as if a camel had kicked me.  Anyway glad you up and about!  Im a great follower of you channel - guitar player myself.  All the best and speedy full recovery, all the way from the other side of the pond at The Rock of Gibraltar.  maybe you can visit us one day!!
Rick I had that surgery for that same reason and with the same symptoms, at the Cleveland Clinic. I was 34 at the time. Luckily my cardiologist realized my heart was enlarged (from over working) and surgery was necessary. Mine was a valve repair, not replacement, which was rather new at the time. That was in 1990, and I have led a normal life since. You too (and we) can enjoy many more of your great videos, and years of life enjoying your family and friends. God bless you sir🙏
Best of luck to you.  Always enjoyed your videos.  But, some of them could be shorter.  Keep that in mind.
Feel better soon, Rick.
Glad you are doing good Rick! Thank you!
Well my comments Rick will be TAKE CARE each second for the rest of your life my friend . Breathe smell look and see fell and play ! Good luck to you . Luc Montreal Canada .
Sending all my love from Brazil, Rick!!!
So glad this heart procedure went well for you, Rick. Many prayers were offered up for you! You look great.
Sonic Youth WMTSG would be super interesting since you asked for suggestions. Glad you're doing better!
When I saw that title, Health Update, no pun intended,  my heart dropped. I enjoy your videos so much. I really like your interviews, especially Seal and the breakdown of that song. Stay healthy, stay strong and rock on.
Wishing you best of the best Rick , speedy recovery amen
Glad you're ok ❤ ....yes, it's a scary thought to have your heart and lungs stopped 🙈  I was in a near-death car crash recently - so I know about scary 😞  I wish you would focus on the jazz stuff. The jazz and pop/rock/jazz (Sting) interviews were so great 👍  Maybe I can hook you up with Mike Stern - so you can do an interview with him?  All the best from Denmark  Steffen
Very happy to see you recovering well ...♥
interview d,angelo
I hope that you have a good recovery Rick.
god speed recovery sir.
There is no good music without philosophical thinking. And there is no philosophy without life. And there's no life without a working human "machine". I'm glad your "machine" was correctly fixed. I love your channel and your videos. Thank you and greetings from Portugal.
Great to see you back up and running Rick. I for one would love to see you break down some more tunes for us. In the 1980s, what was glossed over as 'generic pop music' was sometimes very very intricate. Maybe some interviews with artists from that era would be good..
Rick, your good people.GOD BLESS, all you do.
Great news and, as always, superb advocacy - We need men to talk more about health and the serious-not-fun stuff. That's important. All the Best Rick, you legend.
God bless you Rick! Happy to know that you are well! 👏🏻🙏🏻
Good on ya for getting regular health check ups, heal strong Mate.
I had the same surgery on jan 25th at standford in california. since then I've had to have fluid drained from my left lung 3 times. I can't sleep without sleeping pills. lost my apetite mostly. made my asthma worse. feet very swollen all the time. lost about 20 pounds.  I think I was a bad candidate for surgery at 68 years old. it ruined my quality of life. sometimes I feel like I'm waiting to die. it might just be the meds they have me on.
You are one of my toutchstones Rick, your videos really hit the point with me, your analasys and explanations of the tracks I listen to daily are remarkable. I wish you a speedy recovery buddy!
Glad to see you on the mend Rick 👍✌️🙏
For future interviews, use your presenting skills and consider a series whereby you talk with the writers of very famous songs and ask them where the idea for the song originated and its journey to the recording studio.
Congratulations Rick! Wish you a speedy recovery and many many more years of great music 🎶! Love and respect from Irish in Germany!
Best of health 🙏
I'm glad to see you back and healthy, Rick. Always inspiring us, even in difficult situations. Take care and no need to rush if you need some time off to recover. We will be here waiting to have you shining and rocking with us.
I was lucky enough to see you at Bloomsbury, London last year for a great show and song breakdown.  Sorry to hear you had to go through all this but seems you have reached the other side with no problems, here's to a continued speedy recovery and more videos!
Good luck with your recovery and recuperation.
God Bless you, Rick !!!
❤‍🩹🙏
❤
Sending you all my love Rick- you look great for somebody who had such a major op only a week ago! Honestly I think this years interview videos have been your best content- the Brendan O'Brian being my fav!!
Glad you're ok, Rick. Love you, Brother!
Glad you're doing well , God Bless 🙏
Now you went under cardiac surgery/anthestesia you should pay attention to your cognitive abilities, namely memory, learning new things etc, it’s common to experience cognitive impairment after a cardiac surgery.
Glad your procedure went well and you bounced back so quickly.
Glad you are taking care of yourself. And you are doing well.
Good to hear of a success! Now don't go lifting any valve amps for a while 😅
I will make an AI music dedicated for Rick’s good health. we love you Rick
First Rick I pray for your fast and total recovery , your contributions are huge. If I may next time your in Cleveland for a medical check up I would be honored if you stopped by my shop , play some amps and talk music. DR.Z
Rick take a good break and get well! 🤘🎵🎶
Great news Rick 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
Glad to hear all went well Rick. I’m 66. My heart is good but I’m dealing with blood pressure issues. They’re trying to change up my medication. Also need to reevaluate whether I really need alcohol in my life anymore. I’m a social drinker and not out of control , but I typically drink at least four out of seven days a week. I retire in four weeks so I want to live long enough to enjoy it. My best to you I look forward to your new videos and wish you good health always. Love your vids!
I love your videos Rick glad you feel good after surgery ❤️. I am a big Queen fan and I would love a song breakdown of Somebody to Love.
One of the best music community channel, full of positive energy. Hope you get well soon,Rick, Greeting from Thailand.
So glad to see your healing well. Thank you for all the great knowledge and experience you share. Love the channel. Take care of yourself Rick. We really like having you around. 🎶
Get well! We love you, please never stop!
Glad you are doing well. I have talked to a lot of patients post valve repair, bypass and stint placement, and it is amazing how life changing these surgeries can be for people. I am very happy to hear your experience was positive also.
Rick, I'm so glad you're doing well after the heart surgery!  I do enjoy watching your videos and the loads of information you give us about music and the inner workings of the business!  Stay well!  🎙️🎷😎👍🎼🎶 Tom
Glad to hear everything went well Rick.🙏🙏🙏
You're looking extremely well after significant surgery! All the best Rick.
Interview some deceased players. AI could pull it off. Your welcome.
Sending prayers for your recovery!!!
Incredible. I'm glad it went well and wish you a continued recovery.
So glad that you're fine now.  Wishing you all the best Rick.  ❤
I'm overjoyed to hear you're doing well. I enjoy your interviews and your insight on things musical. Wishing you well.
So glad to hear that it all went well, and that you are recovering so quickly. Take good care of yourself, and if it hurts to cough....... don't cough! 😂
The world needs you Our Dear Professor  Praying for your speedy recovery 🙏  May you Live long and continue bestowing your immense knowledge to us
Glad to see you back again Rick!
More interviews Rick in 2024/2025. I've been subbed over 2 years now and look forward to any of your new videos. Stay well and keep up the fantastic work 👍
Glad you are well now. Thank you for your channel.
God bless Rick
Stay well Rick 🙏
Good to have you back, Rick!  As far as what I'd love to see, is more to do with the process of mixing and/or mastering. I know it might be tough to make it for everyone, but I've seen a lot of videos of people making songs and then just bypass the mixing and/or mastering completely. I'd love to hear what's your process. What to listen to and what tools to use and which tools do what etc. It doesn't have to be an all encompassing lesson, but something to get the idea and thought process behind mixing/mastering. Would love for you to have interviews or sessions with actual mixing/mastering people to go through their process.
400k people in 12 hours are very interested to hear how you're doing.  I'll echo other comments and say the cheesy-but-accurate: You're a treasure, sir. I'm really glad to hear you got fixed up!
I love your work, I'm really enjoying both the song analysis and the interviews too.
👋👋👋👍👍👍💯💯💯🍀🍀🍀
Glad your up n running, healing Rick. We are fortunate to live in developed nations. I was thinking of the song ITIIITIATIIHYLIHYL by Blackshape. It contains some interesting chords and notes worth studying. Its a dark song and they use effects heavily but I think its adds value. Tack och hej from Sweden.
Godspeed Rick.
Get well soon. ☘
Glad you have come through well. I love watching your channel - I did music and music technology degrees back in the early 2000s and you break stuff down like the great lecturers used to do, and I love the insights I get from the array of guests you are able to get.  So happy you’ll be able to continue in good health.
Glad to hear it went well Rick. I always worry about people in the USA who need medical attention for obvious reasons. Health care wouldn't be an issue for yourself but with your lifting restrictions - please don't play a pre-chambered Les Paul 😂 As far as content - I enjoy the interviews, the "What makes this song great?" and although I agree with nearly everything you say about modern music, I  prefer focusing on the positive aspects of our "old person music" and let the young ones find you. There are plenty of young people out there who appreciate real music and many more that are searching.  Positive vibes to you Rick.
Good to see you in such great health Rick. My (and your?) dream would be an interview with Donald Fagen. And with Joni Mitchell too…
I wish you the best for a timely recovery. Take it easy!
get well soon
I pray that you have a speedy and full recovery Rick.
RICK!!!.... HAVE YOU EVER DONE A VIDEO FEATURING 10CC AND DISCUSS THE INSANELY BEAUTIFUL SONG FROM THE 70S, "I'M NOT IN LOVE"   PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO!!!  HUGE FAN! THANK YOU 🤜🤛
Glad you’re feeling better. Your to 20 videos are always fun to watch. Have a great week!✌️😎🇺🇸
So glad your procedure went well and you're back and ready to power on!! Take care Brother!!!
Would love more interviews, they have been great, wider range of people, more WMTSG would be great too
Good to hear. Take care. We love your channel. :)
Peace & Healing to You♥
Happy to see you're back!
Speedy recovery Rick! take it easy...do everything at your pace! Peace love and rock and roll!
Best wishes, Rick. I'm so pleased you can see here how much you mean to so many people.
Glad you're through it, Rick, and hope you recover fully. Medal of honour to you long overdue. Best teacher I've ever known 🙏🤞
So glad you are ok - take it easy!
Hey Rick, all the best from Austria. 👍🏻👍🏻👌🙌
Hey Rick, I wish you a speedy recovery! Take some time off if you need it, we'll always be back to listen/see you when you're back.
Glad to hear you are on the mend!👍 As far as guitar playing goes, just don’t try to play a ‘74 Les Paul.😉
Get well and keep up the great work..
Be grateful for the surgeon, anesthesia providers, scrub techs, and nurses that got you through that safely.
'Why this song is great!' It's where I first found you, so, do that! 😏 Oh, details on 'my' favorite song, 'Wild West End' by Dire Straits would be 'amazing!' Note the lack of a solo throughout by Mark Knopfler yet it's a solo throughout...  🤔 At 65 myself, glad you're still kickin!
No more, 'achy breaky heart', Rick. all the best to you👍
Glad it went well, take care and all the best.
All the Best Rick Glad that all is well 👏 Love what you do God Bless 🙏🏻
Good luck to your health my father also had issues with his heart and it kept him going an extra 10 years longer than he probably expected look after yourself.
Those Les Pauls might be less than 10 lbs, but the Marshalls are not. Take care.
Obviously you are much loved and appreciated for your ability and insight and just all around good guyness lol. I love your work and hope you stick around. Bless you .
Glad you are well.  Appreciate your channel.
Glad you’re on the mend!
We live in a time and age where everyone seems divided. There is so much hate and fear around us all the time.  To have a kind and loving spirit like you Rick to visit for knowledge, joy, wisdom gives me hope. A priceless resource for us all.  Also all the nice and warm comments from the community makes me happy.  All the best to you Rick ❤
Now you know a little bit more about life and death and the importance to use the rest of your time in a good way.
Rick, glad to hear your surgery was a success! You’re an important person in this musical YouTube world.
Happy to see that you are fine even just after a week after surgery! I'm an interventional cardiologist and work with cardiac surgeons, so I know what's you are talking about. Stay healthy!
That's some of the best news, Rick!
Great to hear you are doing well.
Great to see you're doing ok and that the surgery was successful. All the best to you and continued success on your channels. We love what you do and always look forward to a new video.
Nice to know that you are back. Keep full of health Rick!!!
Hello Rick, thank you for sharing. I'm happy for you that you're well and that we all can look forward to new interesting views and input about music! I'd be interested in hearing your take on priorities in sound/instrumentation when artists and bands take their carefully engineered productions on a live tour.
Glad to hear you're taking care of your health, mate. Love and hugs!
Stay well Rick, love the channel!
Rick Beato stay healthy, your a beacon for live music...!🎸
Glad you're OK!
When are you going to interveiw Marcin~!~?~!
My music taste is stuck before 1750,  so I'm not your typical audience, but it's great to see that your new lease on life was a textbook operation. Keep up the beat-o!
All the best. Good to hear that surgery went well. Take your time. I am almost 60. and yes, the end is nearer then the beginning. Keep up the good work.
My dad had this repair done in his early 80’s. He is fine now and you will be too. Love and prayers to you.  Jamie 🙂🇨🇦
Glad you're still with us, brother.
Stay healthy Rick .. your work here , to educate, inform and enlighten is far from over!
All the best Rick
Can't leave this world in the hands of autotune and AI, stay strong, we need you man!
Great that it went and is going so well ... I think you should keep running your show exactly as you please.  Something I'd love to see is you talking about songwriting with more super-artists from bygone days ... mostly English (Bryan Ferry, Ray Davies ... about their internal life and how they "got" some of their best ideas and how they worked them out internally ... a true mystery to me)!
Looking good as ever there Rick I knew you are in good hands. Continuing to pray for your complete recovery.   This goes out to all you lovely people out there, if you're noticing something weird or abnormal with your health, don't be afraid to have an appointment with the doctor, your health and lives matter. ❤️
As a request for a video to make, pls do one about alejandro aranda with his unique percussive fingerpicking style with the open d tuning
❤
Quote: "reframe what we do here" - I hope everyone takes these wise words to their heart. All the best, Rick!!
Congrats on the surgery. Glad that you're back and healthy again! Good luck with your continuing recovery!
Glad to see you're on the mend. Look forward to many more years and even many more videos!
Glad your well Rick
How wonderful you're sharing this with us! Keep doing what you're doing! All the very best to you, Rick! 🤩
Happy to hear, that everything is fine for you now! Looking forward to much more of your great energy !👍
We need more interviews! Greetings from Italy
Would love to see more song breakdowns. Especially from more progressive rock/metal
Helping and educating in a different way ❤️ ‘Health is Wealth’
Bless you!  I had a double bypass when I was 55, and know exactly what you went through!
I'm soooo glad you came out okay on the other end! I've enjoyed all your posts, whether they be interviews, musical theory and analysis, or whatever.  I'm about to have surgery where I won't be allowed to lift more than 10 lbs (spinal in my case), so knowing that I'll be able to play guitar makes me very happy.
covid is on the rise again......so please be careful out there
Glad you are feeling better and out of hospital. God Bless and Keep on Rockin Rick
Amazing to see you up and about so quickly! You look great _and_ I would never have guessed you had open-heart surgery just a week ago! 😮
Such s good Update Rick 🙏🏻 Glad that it all went so well, and quik too 💪🏻🎶😊
I get this! A similar incident a decade ago led to me changing my life for the better.  You keep being the best Rick that you can be and we will keep appreciating you for who you are. Hope the rehab goes well!
Glad to hear Tom's hometown took care of you! Godspeed back to full capabilities and beyond!  I'd love to see a series (like we use to do) where we'd discover a band and finally get an album and relish it. Maybe call it "this is how it use to happen"  or "music the way it use to be"  ??
Get well Rick❤ glad you’re ok 👍
I am so glad everything went well, Rick! Keep on recuperating and don’t come back too soon! ❤
Glad things have worked out. I love the interviews!
Glad you are doing ok
Only in the darkness can you see the stars 🌟🌟🌟  Now you’re back. You are a musical gift🎸🎶 Love from Sweden❤️
Congratulations on what looks like a great surgery and recovery! I had my aortic valve replaced when I was 39 and I definitely wasn't as close to back to normal as you are after a week. Great to see you back at work! ❤‍🩹
Glad you are recovering well Rick. Mary Spender posted a video recently asking for feedback on the direction of her channel, and I'll give you a similiar answer. I love the interviews, and your take on the music industry generally. Give Mary a call and have a chat to her, that will make a good video.
looking good already
Good health mate, enjoy your work, may you do more of it,
I’m glad that you’re feeling well. Wishing you a full and speedy recovery.
❤❤❤ take care, Rick!
We all love you Rick. Take the time to heal. Spend time with your family. You have seen us through some of the craziest times.....we all greatly appreciate you and your channel. We will be right here to support you. Thank you for giving us all so much!
You're looking great Rick. Glad to hear all went well.
Wishing you a speedy recovery
Just keep doing what you've been doing! Love your channel Rick, long time subscriber
Got to slow down Rick, for you and your family. We appreciate your sharing of musical wisdom very much. Be well
SUBSCRIBE, you guys! 🔔
Good that you're back to speed!!  All the best, buddy
Love you, man. Keep getting well. You're a minister of presence for this music appreciator. Peace and great health to you.
Nice that everything went well, hope for a speedy full recovery!
❤
Bonne nouvelle !
Rick…love your channel. I am 71 with MVP, diagnosed about 6 years ago. I see my cardiologist twice a year. My symptoms are light. No fatigue, no other issues. However I do get a little funny when something hugs my chest (like a tight shirt, or a seatbelt). But again, avoiding these triggers keeps me having a largely symptom free life. My cardiologist says if it gets worse, we will make some decisions at that point. I am glad you had a good outcome. I am afraid to do surgery, and so far my cardiologist says it is not necessary at this time. Good luck going forward. Looking forward to many more music discussions through your videos.
WTF!!   Jezus. Look after yourself. ❤❤❤
Hey Mr. Beato!!..first of all, thank you for your channel here!!..I love to watch it, and getting so detailed information, is a wonderful thing, please take good care of yourself-of which I am sure you do, and and big loving hug, from Vienna/Austria!
So glad you are on the mend. Keep Rockin’!
Fuerza❤❤❤
All the best mate.
Speedy recovery Rick!
Is your heart now beating in 4/4 time or 3/4 time? ;-)    Be well, Mr. Beato. Your channel does indeed inform music lovers how to better appreciate what goes into making great music.
Wishing you a speedy recovery Rick ❤.
I'm glad you're back and healthy, Rick!!! May you be blessed with many many more healthy years ^^
Glad to have you back in such a good shape. Best wishes.
que te mejores Rick!
Hello Rick Happy to see you again apparently with feeling good  Take care from France
Eight years ago, on the day before my 61st birthday, I had triple bypass heart surgery.  Within six months I could jog 5k whereas before the op I could only walk a couple of hundred yards before the chest pains kicked in.   I'm fairly sure I feel the same way about my op and medical team and you do about yours. Maximum respect to all those people! Best wishes to you, Rick, from a pensioner in Sunderland U.K.
All the best ❤
Just a short musical break and the beat goes on. Wishing you many more heart beats to come. God Bless you and your channel.
Rick, I'm coming up on the 5th anniversary of my quad bypass, done at age 65, so I suspect I've felt many of the things you're feeling. You'll quickly get past even thinking about this, except when you step out of the shower and see that "zipper" scar in the mirror. Modern medical technology is nothing short of miraculous.
God bless you Rick, sending good vibes and love your way my friend🎸
All the best Rick! You and your work is invaluable!
best blessings for your heart health Rick and speedy recovery. You're so loved and appreciated
Really glad you're feeling great AND can play the guitar as well! :)
Come back even stronger mate!
Stay healthy, Rick. Good luck!
Thank you so much from the bottom of YOUR heart
Great to see you back on your feet and looking great. Take care Rick.
love you rick!
Soo glad your surgery went well and was successful. I've only recently started watching your channel & happy to watch any content you do. I love the interviews and I love the song breakdowns too.
So glad to hear your on the mend.
Hey Rick, looking forward to another 62 years of your really fine videos 👍👍👍
Glad everything worked out for you,Keep it going love what you do 👍
Good to see you, Sir.  God's speed..
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick. Love your channel keep up the good work.
I am glad to see that you are recovering well. It was very thoughtful of you to give us an update. Be well.
Greetings from Melbourne, Australia and best of luck to you Rick. Really love your work, we share much same interest (you went to Cleveland for heslth reasons,, i went there - 2011 - to visit the Hall of Fame).
Don't forget to thank THE MAN, nice to have  you back.
Really glad you feel good and got the condition fixed, Rick. Hope to have you around for many, many years.
Glad you're not in pain and not to much discomfort Rick, take ya time get well, we will all be here for ya anytime. Legend 🤘🏼
Geez Rick, you look as well as ever. We are so glad to have you back. You are an amazing person.
I'm glad to hear that everything went well that you're feeling better as well.
Hello please take care of your self I love you all the very best to you keep going what you are doing xxxx
I’m glad you’re doing better. Taught me about the music industry . How it works and where it’s going. I had a heart attack at 53 in 2013. I have a stent in my main artery. Thank you for everything.
Rick, Im also 62.  About 6-7 wks ago developed chest pain on exertion.  The blockage couldnt be treated with stents so I too had a median sternotomy and a 2 vessel bypass-- also spent time on the heart lung machine for the procedure.  My recovery has been uncomplicated-- in two days will be 4 wks.  Best wishes on your continued recovery!
Rick, Howdy from Texas. Thank you for sharing your medical journey with us. I know that you will likely not see this post but I wanted to state that your life and musical career have provided great meaning to countless people. And now your willingness to openly talk about the medical struggles you’ve experienced has proven to be significant for another countless layer of people who follow you. We love you brother and we appreciate the body of work you have created. Your life has brought new layers of meaning to multiple generations of music lovers. Thank you for your hard work, for your love of the world of music, and for your great mind of musicianship. Be well Brother and keep rocking on!
You are a gem, sir. I am from India. You have many wellwishers here as well. Take care of your health.
Don't you dare fuckin' leave us! We need people like you more than ever!!!... oh yeah, get well soon! ❤
WOW!  Glad you're doing better!  Here's to 62 more years.
I Praise Jesus for your successful surgery
Have some egg-whites every day, very good for healing after surgery. We love you Rick!
Stay healthy Rick. Aren’t these surgeons just incredible people and I say that as a fit 62 year old who had a stent fitted after a heart attack. I’m now back in the pool swimming faster than ever. Your videos were part of my recovery and I’m now sending my best wishes to you all the way from Scotland.
Glad you are well Rick. Keep up the healing.
Glad you’re well! I love the direction of the channel and the vast amount of interviews you have been able to procure. I trust that whatever direction you feel is right and you decide to take the channel in for the next year will be the right one
So appreciate your transparency.  I’ve been updating on your interviews and have come to realize what a unique combination of proficiency and resource you bring to the current conversation of music.  I’m grateful for your smooth experience in healthcare, but excited for your continued input and analysis. Although I am not a Hebrew, I couldn’t agree more with the fullness of meaning: Shalom!
Very happy for your quick healing! keep up the good work.
Best wishes from México
MORE song BREAKDOWN videos!!!
So glad you're doing well Rick. I love your content.
Glad that you are okay, and everything is fine. Thank God.
Welcome back home Rick! Good to hear that your surgery went well and you are recovering quickly. I think your channel is very important to music and the more people that hear it the better so I'm glad you're going to be making videos for a good long time to come
I admire you, my father has got to the point where he’d had a heart attack and the surgery became inevitable. It’s great that you talk about this openly so many of your viewers can see that there is no need to put their lives in danger and the surgery at a right time will prevent further complications.
I’m glad you’re on the mend. Thank you for your service.
Get better soon, Rick!
Hooray! Scars are like re-entry stamps. I have a collection.
Cheers to your health Rick.
May you live long and in good health
Hey Rick, take care of yourself, stay physically active, it's the key to quality of life at our age and way beyond (I'm your age). What you've done is a gift for all of us, even if you never make another video. Thank you so much for that!
🙏
💓
Glad you’re on the mend!! Looking forward to many more episodes!!
I am happy you are ok. As far as you usually having tons of energy. There have been a few of your videos where you seemed like you drank so much coffee that your hands were shaking and you just looked like you were artificially amped up.
I'm glad you're back. 🇵🇹
I'll echo my well wishes as many, many others have - you are a treasure and I have enjoyed everything that you do, and most importantly, the warm, generous and kind spirit you convey through your videos. All the best, Rick!
Glad you are on the mend!
So glad you're doing well, may you continue healthy for many more years!❤
I'm happy that you're okay, mate. The best of health to you!
Thank you for the update Rick, as a guy of 63 with looming heart/pulmonary issues myself I feel your story extra close brother, very glad you're doing well!
Take care Rick and get well soon 🙏
Wishing you the best Rick...❤
Welcome to the Zipper Club Rick .
Wish you fast recovery💪🙏
Wish you the best, you are great Rick!
So glad that everything went so well and you're back "in the saddle". Take it easy and look after yourself - you're an absolute treasure!
take good care of yourself, Rick! nothing more important than one's health! Greetings from Romania!
Hey Rick so glad you're doing well man!! I've got the same scar from a cancer surgery years ago and some recent heart issues at 55 so I can totally relate. Just reminds us to make the most of each day we're given. Here's to many more years for both of us!!
Rick, we are so blessed to have you. My nephew just today went through a very similar surgical process as you. Thank God you are feeling better. We need you to stick around at least another 20 years. I still have so much to learn. Take care!
We know more about Ric right now than our president… weird times. Glad ur ok!
My Mom gets TAVR
Happy to hear it.
Praying for you to stay well!
Crazy! I had open-heart for aortic root ten months ago, and my recovery is still miserable for me, and I’m young, too! My care team literally writes the book regarding the condition and surgery for other doctors and surgeons to follow, but my body just won’t recover. And pain meds didn’t work, so I had to recover from surgery completely raw. But, it’s my body trolling me with a genetic defect and nothing I’m doing wrong. To say I’m envious is an understatement.
I'm glad you made it back. ❤
My grandmother had that, she lived to be 85. She probably could have kept patching it up but at that point she'd done all she needed to, so she let go.
I had a triple bypass 15 months ago. Recovery was some heck of an experience. I'm sure you're aware! Of course, not the same procedure, but the sternotomy. Fun.
So glad you're taking care of yourself and now on your way to feeling better and healthier! Best channel on youtube.
I wish you a great recovery mate and heaps of energy to play your guitar🤘
Have a wonderful  recovery Rick!
Live long, beat strong (your heart), and prosper Rick! ॐ  Om̐ Shanti Om̐
Cleveland Clinics is an awesome hospital, with a cream of the crop staff. That being said, I’m glad to see you, up and around! 👍🏻
Glad youre recovering well. I dig the interviews, keep them coming
great that you repaired heart seems successful, mine is giving me problems as well, same age as you , i had two stints surgically done of course lol this past valentine day , I’m still tired most days and my healthcare pcp really doesn’t seem that involved at least to me anyway, is what it is i guess… peace
Wishing you a speedy recovery, which it sounds like you're making good on!  My son has had 3 open heart surgeries for mitral valve repair. We're both big fans of yours! All the best to you and your family as you recover.
Glad to see you feeling great, wishing you all the best 💪
Glad to see you so well.
🖖
Good to see you in the mend. All the best.❤
Glad you're on the mend! Take it easy and pace yourself until you feel 100%!
Don't work too hard Rick, hope you getting better soon. Really heartbreaking to see you so thinner than before.
Glad you’re on the mend
All the best Rick! I would love if you could review and analize The Warning. They're on the rise and have a very cool story for a band of three sisters from Mexico. They have a sound of new and old rock all together.
So with your wonderful american health system did you have to sell your house to pay the bill?
I did no know about this. Should be checking the channel more often 😬Amazing that you're "up and running" only one week after OHS!!! Wow! Imagine this only 30 years ago? You're a strong man and a great guy and educator and interviewer and I'm happy that you're  on the path to many more years of music. Wishing you the best.
I had open heart surgery when I was 4 (over 50 years ago). The tech these days is amazing. Best wishes to you!
Glad you are doing well Mr Beato .  Wish for you, quick healing.
God bless 🙏
Thank you sir.  Stay well.
Glad all is well!!
I wish U a good recovery Rick BEATO !
That's unreal. Glad your recovery seems to be going well.
Good luck mr. Beato Maybe you can research and talk about why music can make you happy or sad. It seems to be a fundamental of music, the emotions. Stay strong and recover.
im glad your ok and sending you a lot of musical vibes Rick !
Godspeed Rick! I wish you a speedy recovery and a healthy future.
@Rick Beato Greetings from the state of Virginia, Rick.  I just noticed what was unexpected news to me.  I am very happy to hear that you have been progressing extremely well since your heart surgery😌  Very best wishes, always, Andrea S. (former Long Island, NY resident, incidentally)
Glad you're okay. Take care.
I love you Rick. God is good. Love you
Glad you're well. Thank you for reminding me that music is good, good for the soul.
I'm glad you're well, Rick!
Rick, I wish you a full recovery.  I used to watch your channel but when you gave a short reaction, and then only talking about the production not the group, I left.  I won’t return but I wonder if the ‘new music’ your wondering about (heard on another channel) is of your own doing by not ‘listening’ to music outside your comfort zone (even groups from other countries - say Japan).  Get well.
Best wishes. Stay strong.
I have enjoyed all you do, and I am so glad you are doing well. You look great and you have great spirit, so keep going !! and keep us going, look forward to more Cool Rick Beato Videos!! God Bless
Wishing you a speedy recovery. Sending our best wishes from Lithuania
So glad you came through the surgery, and hope you continue to lead a long and productive life creating great videos which inspire our youth to appreciate music as a valuable art form. Great music is created by musicians who have honed their talent to a fine edge, and not wasted their time developing their AI dexterity. There will always be a place for real music created by talented and dedicated artists, and you will go down in history as one of the true leaders of that cause. Thank you so much!
Looking great Rick! Wishing you lots of energy and good health!
So glad to hear you're OK. You're a treasure for music world.  Your sharing & years of honestly-earned wisdom & insight is priceless.  Stay well, brother.❤
Wishing you all the best Rick. So glad it went well. The music is beautiful; may it go on forever.
Get well quickly. Praying for your speedy recovery
Here’s to 60 more years of Rick Beato!
God bless you!
Rick - so glad you’re on the mend & feeling good. I had open heart surgery in 1965 when I was 6 years old and still here so you have a long life to look forward to. If you’re interested you should read a book called “King of Hearts” which chronicles the story of the doctors who pioneered open heart surgery, it’s really fascinating. Love your videos especially the ones which break down songs ‘cause even though I love music I don’t have any idea about the process behind creating it or music theory. Keep the videos coming!!!❤❤❤
How he heck does your sternum not hurt? I fractured mine once and it was excruciating for months. Get well.
Best wishes Rick, I fell ill 7 years ago with a similar problem and know the hoops you have to jump though to deal with it. Great channel and keep up the excellent work
relax and get well Rick. love and all the best from Greece
so glad you are doing well and looking forward to eternal positivity. And you contribute so much to my pleasure of music.....
Rick, I'm very glad your surgery was successful.  Please continue on the road to recovery and rest easy.  I've been a drummer since before the age of 7.  My grandfather got me hooked by playing Gene Krupa.  I took lessons for years and learned to read music, drum music. I look at a sheet and see quarter note triplets , time signatures, etc.  As a drummer the key of C might as well be the key of Garage.  When you break down a song I can tell we hear the same nuances and subtleties.  The difference is you can articulate and explain while I cannot.  Certainly not as well as you.  I love the interviews.  But I feel validated listening to you explain to me what I think.  Mike STL MO
Have a quick recovery Rick
I’m so glad it went well, Rick! I look forward to more amazing content! 💙💙💙
Hey Rick, long time sub, same age- Super happy everything went excellent brother!
Congrats on your successful surgery and speedy recovery so far. Just a coincidence my wife is celebrating her fifth anniversary today of having her mitral valve replaced among other things. Take care....
Glad to hear you had a good outcome.  Take care.  Wish you the BEST!
I’m so glad you’re okay.  As another commenter said, you are national and might I add cultural treasure.  You are one of the few people keeping me sane these days!
bless you! I suffered my second heart attack in may, last year..3 weeks in hospital and 3 bypasses..I know the feeling..love from Italy
RICK!  You look great brother!  take care of yourself... ORGANIC diet NO SUGAR and more MUSIC!  much love and prayers for good health...... any content you upload I'll be here.
Take care Rick! Stay healthy and all the best from Germany! Keep grooving! Nicolas
God bless you!!!! Pray for your great recovery.
Don't scare us like that man❤!
So glad it went well!!!!!  Hope the rest of your healing goes as smoothly!
well done for sharing man .  all the best to you 😅
Show me your scar Rick. 😮
I'm 68.  Can't play a lick of music.  Can't read a lick of music.  I just like the music I like.  However, I love the interviews, learning how interconnected the musicians have been over the years, playing with each other, learning from each other.  Keep it up, Rick.  P.S. Good to see you back after your trip to Cleveland!
That's so great! Wishing you all the best.
Glad you’re doing so well, brother!! Keep it up!!!
glad you are doing well - thank you for the update!
Be well, Rick.
God bless you, Rick!
Happy to hear you are doing well!
Wishing you well man and a speedy recovery, in shā’ Allāh. I had a stint put in a couple of months back after having some similar symptoms (I’m 51). Godspeed on your recovery!
Keep well, mate.
good luck with your health Rick, sounds like you are on the mend which is great
rock on Rick! 👊🏼
Did you get a biologic heart valve or a mechanical heart valve replacement. Just curious. Hope you have a safe and healthy recovery.
So glad things went perfectly for you, Rick! I went through some surgical procedures, a little while back that were somewhat messier, but I’m getting better all the time. It really is remarkable how much things of advanced since we were kids. What they almost casually repaired in you is what they couldn’t successfully help my dad with in the late 80s.  Do what you love love, what you do… And do it for a very long time.    🖖😎
Hey boss, whatever you want to do is fine with me.  I watch all your content.  Get better soon, old man!
This happened because Melon broke Rick's heart.
Glad your doing well.......
when I saw the earliwer post, I had that momentary thought...  not that Rick might be unwell enough to need surgery... that sucks, but something has to take us all sometime....  no...  the thought I had was ...  Man what an awesome body of work Rick has created, with considered analysis, interviews and thought provocing presentations....  and I am honestly smiling at the thought that this work will outlast Rick at somepoint. Thakyou sir... and kia kaha (stay strong) from New Zealand
❤get up..shake shake, shake,....shake shake shake... yo bootie ..dance the dance of the white haired gumba....americas band director..also..a sit down with  Richard Bennett, very classy guitarist....neil.diamond/m. knopfler...and more..might be appropriate....❤
Thank you for the update. Glad everything went well!🙏😊
Be well, Rick, the great musician and the great interviewer. Greetings from Crimea😇
Strength and healing to you, Maestro!  You’re an incredible inspiration for yet another reason!!!
Happy healing ❤️‍🩹 love your song break downs
Wishing you the best, Rick.
let,s go Rick.
This is a fresh new start for you, Rick. Happy you're back in the saddle!
Glad you are doing great, Rick!
We all love you Rick, And we're all very releaved that you're in good health now.
Glad you are on the mend ❤❤❤❤
I’m glad you are feeling well good bless you
I am glad you’re feeling good!
We are all glad you are doing well!
So happy it went well Rick!!!!!
I had the exact same surgery in 2017 and I felt great immediately afterwards but I now have the same problem as before of always feeling tired. Can we chat?
Have a speedy recovery Rick! The world needs you ❤
The most important thing is to take care of yourself.... You are respected,  loved and needed. God Bless...
Good to see you back! Enjoy your channel and the value you bring to us music fans.
Hey Rick ! Take it easy and get plenty rest and gradually get up to speed with your work. Wish you a speedy and full recovery. See you brother……🎸🙏
Take it easy rick, glad the surgery went well
So glad you are doing ok after your surgery! Love your channel no matter what you do, it's just such a pleasure to tune in and see what excites you about the musical world.
Wishing your long & great health!
I'm glad you're doing well! My great aunt had a genetic defect with one of ber heart valves, and had an artificial one put in, but unfortunately due to a complication with a surgery to replace the valve some years back she passed away during the surgery. I still think about her sometimes, as she lived close when I was growing up, and she loved music and was a wonderful singer.
good on you Rick
Great to hear that you’re doing well!…Love your videos.
Awesome!!
Looks like you have your own chapter of the zipper club. I’m in too since 2012. Keep on ticking!
We're all very happy to see you recovering well Rick !...have learned so much from watching your amazing channel over the years. Wishing you good and health and hope to see many many more videos !! 💪👍
Rick. So glad you are recovering nicely.!  Happy you are keeping in with your fantastic work
Oddly enough I heard you went through this from Christopher Cross whom I spent some time with over the weekend. Of course I had to mention your interview with him and it took us on a whole other conversation tangent. Anyhow so glad thing worked out well for you and always look forward to just about any content you choose to make!
Glad your are recovering and feeling so well! Ain't medical science great? Wishing you continued wellness!
Very glad to hear that everything went well for you, Rick.
God Bless you and your family, Rick
Hey Rick, I’m glad to hear you’re doing well now. We want to keep the good guys around and you are one for sure.💀✌️⭐️☮️🖤🌅🎉🇺🇸
As a nurse that loves your channel I’m glad that everything went well and you are doing good. 🤘🏻
BEst of luck and continued health to you, Rick!
Love you, Rick
Hey Rick - my 2 cents .... not a huge fan of the interviews. I like this channel for you and your thoughts/opinions on music and the music industry. Any videos in the future that contain that (and I would like your HONEST thoughts/opinions) I'm in!!!!!
G'day Rick. I am pleased that your medical issues have been sorted  Take care and stay positive mate. Regards from Australia.
great to see you back .be well.
Sheesh! Rest up.
Glad to see that everything went well! All my best
Hey Rick- glad to hear the surgery went well and that you're on the mend.  There's a gazillion comments so you may not see this one, but the sentiment remains.  Thank you for all you do and bringing much-needed knowledge, art and entertainment to this dark world.  Via con Dios.
Take care !!!! WE need cool positive people like You !!!!! cheers !!! music man !!!
Hey Rick, I watch nearly all of your videos but never comments on any of them. I really appreciate you and all the work you do. I wish you continued health.
Your beats now have a snappier attack and cleaner transients!
We love you Rick!
Me too, Rick.
I'm so glad you are doing great! My wife had open heart surgery a couple of years ago to replace a heart valve that was defective from birth. It's amazing what they can do today. Rock on Rick! I really enjoy what you do on your channel
So happy for your excellent surgical outcome!
So glad you are doing SO well Rick.  I have really enjoyed watching your channel and your encyclopedic knowledge of the music industry.  You are a legend!!  Thank you and here's to a continued recovery!
I am very happy to hear how well you are doing! Your videos have helped me think about and dabble with music on a deeper level. You've played a key part in helping me analyze and understand not just theory and chord progressions, but also by noticing different elements and sounds in songs that are often in the background. I made the plunge to get back into music after almost 12 years, and I now feel a desire to finally learn guitar. Thank you for playing a key part in helping me love not just listening to music, but learning and playing it.
Wishing you All the Best with Good Health in the future Rick. Glad the ❤surgery turned out so successful
Doctor’s orders: Don’t pick up a Les Paul or anything heavier
General anesthesia is crazy, man. It's like for that time that you're "out" it's like you don't exist. 5 hours could go by or 5 million years, it's all the same. It's really freaks me out to just not "exist" anymore. I'm hoping there is some spiritual dimension where we do go to after death.
Rick, just finding out about this.  Glad you're ok. Congratulations on this successful procedure and may God be with you.  Yeah, I want to start writing songs, so breakdowns, analyses, etc. would be great.
Glad you are recovered Rick.
In regards to what kind of videos you should do going forward… do whatever you want! We love all of your stuff! If you’re happy making it, we’re happy watching it. Glad you’re recovering well, my man.
Glad you're doing well.  Love your videos!
love you, man, stay healthy, & best wishes, always.
you're incredible !  I can't believe how quick and painless your recovery!!  What is the secret ?
Glad you’re back and doing great, Mr. Beato!  ☮❤🐾
Glad you're ok!!
Welcome to the club bro. Had my quad bypass 3 years ago. Much better now. What an amazing age we live in.  Continued success. Stay your course.  👍🫡😎 cheers 🥂  Kujo ,  middle TN.
God Bless you Brother.
WELCOME BACK MY FRIEND. ALL YOUR MANY FANS LIVE YOU BROTHER RICK. YOU ARE BLESSED WITH GREAT MUSICAL TALENT AND KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC THEORY AS WELL AS  BEING A FANTASTIC GUITARIST. YOU ALSO PLAY THE KEYBOARDS WONDERFULLY. WELCOME HOME FRIEND. GOD BLESS YOU.
Glad it went well. Cheers to more years on Earth!
Glad you’re well! Godspeed in your recovery.
Glad you are doing well, Rick!!
From one human to another, I wish you well very very soon.
Hey Rick, heart patient here. One thing the docs don’t tell you, and aren’t trained to deal with, is that upward of 70% of heart patients deal with depression. Happy to plug you in to some folks that are super helpful in that regard. Best of luck in your healing, man. I love your work, but give your body time to get healthy. <3 from an Atlanta native.
So glad you’re recovering. Love the interviews but I vote for more WMTSG videos. Those have taught me to hear things I never knew about in songs I love.
Glad you're recovering well Rick. Thanks for the update.
Great to see you healthy, Rick! Thank you for sharing and look forward to seeing you healthy for many more years to come!
You had open-chest heart surgery last week and feel fine? Huh?!?
You can’t play a Norlin-era Les Paul  for the next five weeks either Rick…’cause those weigh more than 10bs. 😉
God Bless you, Rick! Be well!
I'm so glad that your procedure was successful.  we love you, Rick. keep doing what you're doing for hopefully a really long time. ❤
Happy you're healing and will be sharing your gifts with us for a long time to come ❤️❤️😊
I'm glad you're ok now.  I was diagnosed with MVP at around age 26.  This year, I was told that I was misdiagnosed and I don't have it.  My cardio geneticist told me that 30 years ago, the imaging technology was nowhere near the level it is today and as a result, a lot of people were misdiagnosed.  My echo cardiograms have never shown any MVP related issues all these years.  I just have a bowed aorta.  While I'm relieved, I can't help but feel a little miffed that I spent over thirty years thinking that there was something wrong with my ticker.  I'm sorry that it took going into severe mode for someone to finally take some action with yours.  I'm glad you got a great surgeon, though.  👍❤️
Thank you for all the work you have done to make people like me understand the mysteries of the music theory.
So glad you’re doing well, Rick!! Keep on keepin on, brotha. 💪
Love your: What makes this Song so good" Your view on music is so interesting to me
So glad you’re doing well 😀
much love from romania, rick! my mom had the same surgical intervention many years ago, when she was 52. now she's 85 and in great shape (beside using a walking frame all the time, since a year or two)
Very happy you're virtually pain-free and healing up Rick. Love your channel, you're a good dude (from what I can tell 🙃).
I just get that weak feeling behind my knees when I think about getting surgery 😢   Even when others talk about it my body gets the heebie-jeebies!   GET WELL RICK! I’m literally praying for you 🤲
Glad you're taking care of yourself.
Rick, I’m glad everything went well with your heart surgery! You’ve been a great contributor and teacher to me and many others! Good bless you and keep up the good work’
So glad your surgery was a success! One BIIIG thing off of the to-do list.  I know you’ll put that improved oxygen circulation to good use… hopefully maybe take some extra time off after you’re given the all-clear, and spend some bonus time with family for a group-exhale after so many years of knowing that ultimately you would have to undergo that surgery - ?  If it were me and I had the bank to do it, I’d hire in an ekg tech with some portable equipment to hook up to me and some recording equipment, and record about an hour of that new resting heartbeat with all of those glorious lub-dub life sounds percolating in perfect healthy rhythm… maybe listen to them on a loop at night until my brain turned them into something musical. Can’t get much more personal in composition than using one’s own heartbeat as the inspiration! 🤷🏼‍♀️  Take care and be well!
Get well soon Rick! We all Love You Man!!
Good to hear your surgery was successful and you're on the mend.  Please give an update now and then.  Great to see you're going to be around a good long while.
Awesome to hear it, Rick! Love from Brazil 💚💛💙🤍
Glad you're feeling well, best of luck with the recovery!
As for your channel, I personally love What Makes This Song Great because of how well you highlight the musicians, the music and some good ole fashioned theory to boot. You put it all together. The old thing of "it's got a beat, you can dance to it," or justifying a song's greatness merely on record sales or time on the charts gets old. Your series is refreshing.
Glad you are all good!
You’re a great guy, Rick.
Rick, get well soon!
Prayers
Glad to hear that your surgery was successful, Rick! Wish you the best of health and everlasting happiness. May all good things come your way. Take care. Best wishes.
Glad you got thru that Rick... Taker easy eh?✌
Wth...PROducers are suppose to be heartless...hehe .......glad your not Dead..❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
✌️🙂❤
Hey I just had a heart ablation to slow my heart down and last year I had a pacemaker put in to keep it from going too low but yeah man I was home for lunch it was great it's great what medicine can do for you now
You're one of the best, Rick. You've made the world a better place to be. Keep it up.
Best wishes for a full recovery Rick. Welcome back
UK Proms last Saturday. Bigging-up Disco era. Audience went bananas for ‘Staying Alive’.  Seems you have friends everywhere, Rick! 🐝 John Kennedy.
Good to hear that your recovery is going well! I'd like to see you do analysis of blues recordings. For example Johnny Winters Leland Mississippi Blues.
We love you rick you're a national treasure to the music community old and young!
Yeah, the thought that they stop your heart and lungs is pretty scary, but like I told everyone, this surgery is pretty much a walk in the park for these guys. So I had no concerns at all. BUT, if I happened to die, I knew I had had a very charmed life up until that point. Not saying I was ready or wanting to die, but I accepted that it was a risk, as small as it was, it was still a risk. In the hospital I joked with the staff, recalling Ronald Reagan and the stories that he did the same. While his situation was much worse, I still wanted to, strangely enough, put them at ease instead of the other way around.
semoga panjang umur dan sehat sejahtera
Glad you're back and healthy, Rick! Positive Vibes Comin' At You!
Wish you all the best, Rick! May God bless you!
Greetings from Australia. Glad to hear you did well. Life is short so enjoy the improvement to your health. Best wishes.
❤ Seinfeld: They can't all be the best! Great you're better, Rick!
Right on Rick, glad you're doing well.
Great to see that you're feeling well, Rick!
Glad to see you rebounding nicely! Thank you for all you do for music.
Glad you’re on the mend Rick.🫣👍
So glad all went well. You are very popular here in Australia :).
This is good news, praying for you brother.  If you can't lift anything over 10 lbs, leave your Les Pauls on the rack - LOL.  Heal up, Professor.  We your students need you!🙏
Glad you are OK! ❤‍🩹
Glad you're doing well, Rick
Rick so glad to hear you’re feeling well!!!  Thanks for the update, stay healthy!!!
Peace, health, and prosperity.
So grateful to see this video.  Bless you Sir. : )
Good to hear you're okay. Stay healthy!
Stay healthy✌️✌️
We are glad you are doing great! Thank you for  the update.
Man, that’s heavy.  Glad  you’re doing well, Rick.
Out of curiosity: did you ever consider mini invasive cardio surgery for this kind of operation? I know there are some clinics in the US that do this kind of thing.
same thing happened to my mitral valve!  My recovery was a bit more painful than yours, so great job so far! Be patient though….you can still injure that healing sternum
God bless you!
I'm glad you're ok.  :)
Happy for you Rick. It's amazing what they can do today.
Glad you are doing well! I love your channel and any direction you go in I will follow.
You are a national treasure and millions of people are relieved you are getting stronger and on the mend. ❤️
Many years ahead!,
I had my mitral valve repaired 6 years ago. 7 years ago they discovered the regurgitation. The following year they told me I needed surgery in a year or two. The funny thing is I really didn't have any classic symptoms of the condition. Dunno why, but I didn't. But I opted to get the surgery as soon as possible. Mostly because I had what I thought was pretty good insurance. It was, but I have even better now. Anyway, I opted to do it as I had a pretty good feeling I wasn't going to be at that job for the next year or so and I didn't want to risk having worse insurance than I already did.  I'd say it's pretty amazing that a week later you're making videos. I was in the hospital for 5 day. I got the side entry rather than via the sternum. I hear the sternum is grueling for recovery. I took the entire 2 months off for recovery. After one month I was pretty good actually, but I didn't want to risk anything. Especially since I was in Fine Dining at the time and those are long days on my feet. Congrats on a successful repair!
As Clevlander, I need to know; did you say, "Hello Cleveland!" when you got here?
glad to here you feel good.
Rick, great to see you so fast in the path of recovery! Take it easy!
Wow, take care of yourself, man. I'm glad you are already on the rebound. It's ok if you slow down a bit while you recoup. Don't feel obligated to push yourself too much. Heal up and we'll see you on the other side.
RIP Rick. 🪦   Jk man 🍻 Hope there's no complications and you're good to go for much longer.
Glad you are well! ✌️😔
So happy to hear of your successful procedure, keep up the walking! I’m a type 1 diabetic who plays drums and fully understands the challenges of staying healthy, I love your program - long live rock!
Great news, mate! All the best, going forward.👊🎶
God bless you Rick. Glad your surgery went well. Our bodies are temporary and will all eventually give out. Our soul is eternal. And there’s only one way to heaven for our soul: Jesus Christ. I pray you will seek and find Him 🙏
Have a good recovery, Rick! It is amazing (truly) what can be done to adjust or repair our bodies by medicine and doctors.  Greetings and love from Norway =)
So glad you are okay. Have had three OHSs and it’s amazing how far medicine has come since I was born with my condition in *date redacted*. Love your channel. Be well!
Flexibility in any direction on this channel might be useful in this AI era  -im here for it 🎼
I like the mix of your channel.  The interviews are great but my favorites are what makes this song great, and your top 10 or top 20 lists
Glad you're alright now. Take good care of yourself!
You are a global treasure sir! Love from India! ❤
"What makes this song so great" is my personal favorite! Get back to some of those. The breakdowns of every part are eye (and ear) opening even for songs that are VERY old. Boston "More than a Feeling" is one that comes to mind. I never heard all of that!
So very glad to hear you're doing well and wishing you continued complete and speedy healing.  Want to also thank you for the wonderful work you are doing, and for sharing you wonderful gifts;  you are  both insightful and charismatic. :   )  I'd also like to. pass on an important book I would encourage you take a look at for continued heart health and  overall well being.                                                    The book is called 'Eat For Life' by Dr. Joel Fuhrman and it is invaluable info for all.  He also has wonderful videos on is channel.  Take care and  God Bless.
Love you Rick! So glad you got this done and you're on the mend Looking forward to more,  new videos What Makes this Song Great-more, more, more!
All the best with it...... great result.
Get well brother...rock on!!!!!
Thank you Rick! Glad you’re doing well. Your interviews are the best in the bizz.
Its great that you're pro active about your health, you're bright light in a dark world
Wishing you all the blessings and happiness Rick! Your contribution to the music community is a blessing to us. I too had open heart surgery a few years back. God bless.
God bless you, Rick! 🙂
Glad to hear surgery was successful!!  You look better, energy is obvious!  Future videos, personally I love your " what makes this song great?".  To listen to the track separated helps me understand what I'm hearing.  It really is fascinating to me. Thank you for all you do!
Glad to hear you doing well and are on the mend.
So glad you came through, also glad you caught this before it got serious. Keep up the good work on you r informative videos.
Welcome to the club, Rick! Had a Thoracic Ascending Aortic Aneurysm repair (valve sparing) and one CABG at 64 myself! Life is good, my brother! Speedy recovery!
Glad you are feeling better! Best wishes!
Nice to hear you're feeling fine and keep the great work! Channel is amazing and getting better all the time! Thanks for all your dedication, Rick!
Happy for you Rick. I’ve heard that can be pretty painful. Glad you’re doing well.
God Speed Rick! Glad to hear it went well. 🤘🏻
❤ I'm glad to hear you are on the mend! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Glad to hear you’re doing great after your surgery.
Rick! 15 Years ago Last Week I had the exact same Surgery performed and it was the Best Thing I Have Ever Done! Saved My Life For Sure And As My Doctor Said He Maybe Gave Me Another 50 Years! I'm 68-Closet Guitar Player But Still A Working Drummer! Surgery Did Nothing For My Beat But My Rhythm Is A Little Better!! Hope All Gets Better!!  Rooster In MInnesota
I’m so glad you’re doing well and how successful the surgery was!! I am a registered diagnostic cardiac sonographer and that is what we do - assessing the severity of the regurgitation/valve. Always happy to see and hear a good news, especially for you!!
I love the song break downs, but you gotta do what interests you or you'll burn out, so you do you Rick! Glad you're doing well.
Best youtuber ever for many many years more!! Good vibes to you!!
Thank God he made it through...
thank you Rick - I wish you all the best health! ❤🎸🎹
12 years ago, triple bypass. One, t-shirt drove me crazy as chest hair was growing out. And two, weird crunching feeling as sternum took a while to fuse back together. Rick, been there done that. Glad to see you up and back!😊
I’m glad you’ve made it through this successfully. Having grown up watching my dad deal with heart issues, the photo of you in the hospital with the little plush heart hit close to home.   Dad had bypass surgery when I was a teenager, so I understand how difficult the recovery can be. Thoughts and prayers for your speedy recovery, and I’m glad to see you posting content! ❤🎸
So glad you had your procedure! Thank you & God’s blessings 💪
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Hey Rick! Glad you're doing well and recovered!!
No Les Pauls until after Labor Day!  SGs ONLY!!  “Doctor’s” orders!
Take care of yourself, man. Health always comes first. I lost my Dad to heart problems because he refused to get surgery in time.
Glad all went well! Hang in there. We were both born in '62 so I can relate. If you want to start out with some light lifting how about a "What makes this song great" featuring Hardaway, What is Love? That song kills me.😄
I had open heart surgery as a 1 year old in 1981, and a porcine tissue mitral valve put in in 1997.  St. Mary's hospital in Rochester gave me a new life.  Not being able to do sports I took to guitar and have been playing since 1992. My mom taught me 3 chords and I took it from there.  I look forward to your videos and hope your recovery is quick and seamless.  God bless you and thank you for the content, I look forward to every video.
My bestie just had a heart-attack and had to have a triple bypass. It was traumatic. Glad to see you're OK! 🙌🏻👊
Definitely more song analysis and top 20's! Great to see you feeling so good, SO soon! When I had cancer surgery 3 years ago, I was much the same only mine was robotic. You are loved and treasured my musical friend!
I was always stunned by the sheer amount of veggies on your counter at the top of the Al Di Meola interview...  I'm guessing now that you were really taking care of yourself since you knew about this condition you have.  Well done, Rick!  Not only are you an amazing musician, but also a health guru!  I'd love to hear more about how you eat... even though it's not what the channel is about!  Good vibes and prayers for you and your family!!
I am a cardiac survivor as well. Good to hear that you are doing well too!
So glad you’re feeling good!!
G’Day Rick, what makes this channel great ? Is you Rick. I’d like to see more what makes this song great videos. Your insights into music production, instruments , sounds and vocals is why many of us music lovers watch your channel. All the best moving forward Brother.
Don't pick up an old les Paul. Too heavy!
Wish you continued good health Rick. I would like to see you continue the number of interviews you did this year.
Rick I enjoy everything you want to share!
So glad you're well... Keep the interviews coming. I get inspired and learn something new with each video. Thank you for allowing so many artists share their story. You're documenting history.
Feel better Rick! Have a speedy recovery. ❤
As for channel direction, I beg for a video that shows tape getting cut and how that all went down back in the day...thx Rick!
Get well soon Rick!
Surgery is a stressful thing but thankfully modern medicine really is so good and so advanced that when the doctor tells you it's "textbook" the vast majority of the time they really mean it and aren't just saying that for your psychology. Don't be afraid to take the time to internalize that stress Rick. It's easy to kind of try to "tough guy" your way through it and bury the emotional experience of it. Anyway, I'm sure, like you mentioned, this will end up being a huge benefit for you and improve your quality of life! Rehab well!
Feel better Rick! You are amazing and we're all rooting for you and excited for what you'll do next
Ok Rick, that's great news, now you've got that out of the way get your butt back in the saddle, I'm expecting more amazing content brother.
Take it steady Rick  love the content.
I'm so glad your surgery went well!
Not sure if you will read this but regarding content ... I think you owe  it to the world to keep doing those interviews.. So many stories still to be told and time is ticking ...  A lot of musicians that we would love to see you interview will most likely not be with us in another 5 -10 years....
Well, Rick, I was surprised to hear you had  heart surgery done. I’m so glad that it was successful. By way of encouragement, while I am a fan of music and played trumpet, as a dilettante, from fifth grade to 12 my knowledge of music is rudimentary. Your series of what makes this a great song is so incredibly valuable to me because it points out things that I would never hear or understand. Things a trained musician such as you see. Many musicians understand all this and see all this and hear all these things but your ability to convey that information - Priceless. Blessings on you for many more years to come.
Great news Rick! Thank you for your great attitude in the face of this difficult episode and returning with your important mission.
Yay!   I'm glad you are doing well.  I'm having issues.   Im going in for tests
Good on you Rick. The things you’ve come up with for the channel(s) have “your” thing about them. Genuine. Enthusiasm. Interest. Fun. Incisive. Because that’s you mate. Just be - you.
Great to see you back Rick! good for you, mate! Glad it all went your way. You're actually looking well. Don't push yourself too hard, we are patient!
So glad to hear that went so well Rick. I know we were all pulling for you. Good job, btw for being proactive on it and not just ignoring the symptoms, as many people would do. Kudos!
Take care man… and thanks for all you contribute musically and thoughtfully
Godspeed for a quick recovery! You look great! My 72 year old mother just had the same surgery.  The mitral valve is the toughest one, so glad it went well. Glad to see you back! Don’t push yourself too hard, your content is worth the wait and your fans will be here when you are ready. All the best!
Glad it all worked out and you are doing great .look forward  to many more interviews and history of music  and  new videos.
We need you....be well !!!
Glad you're on the mend!
I had double valve replacement. Aortic and mitral. It's a tough surgery, take care
You’re the best. ❤🎉😢
glad you're ok!
So, you couldn't lift an old Les Paul studio 😊 Good to know you are ok
Wish you the best
Prayers for healing. Glad you came to our Cleveland Clinic, the best. Arnold's here from time to time. ❤
Congratulations on your excellent outcome!
I'm so elated to hear you're back in the saddle and kicking ass. Long live Rick 'n' Roll!
Keep strong, soldier on champ.
Bless your heart, we hope you're doing well. You should keep doing what you've been doing. Now is no time to change! DON'T MESS WITH SUCCESS!
Even though your physical heart isn't doing the best, your spiritual heart is always on point! Hope you feel better,  and keep it up!!!
Looking good Rick 🤘
God grant you a full recovery, Rick - sounds like you're more than half-way there already; great to hear.
Rick please hang in there and take care of yourself. Getting old is not for sissies. One thing is for certain, when you start watching your friends and band mates on the PUP list or worse.  It gives pause to stop and reflect.😊
I’m happy you are well, Rick.
Congrats on successful surgery - it's a restart of life
I hope you good health and that everything in your life goes well. And about your channels and videos: do what you like the most. it's your channel. people liked because you liked to do it in first place. so it won't change. again, all the best for you.
So happy that you are feeling well!  I love watching/listening to your videos!  Hope you're still doing this for many, many years to come.
OMG Rick glad you're okay. I was diagnosed with this same problem about 8 months ago and I'm 63; almost 64. Is this what awaits me? Yikes! I work out regularly and haven't been feeling any of the symptoms you described. Fatigue, well maybe, but I've always been prone to it. Just hoping it's not that serious and I have a few more years. God bless you brother.
I would love to see behind the scenes stuff. document the making of an album or something like that.
I'm happy that everything went well. I love all your videos, but "What makes this song great?" are my favorites.
Nothing over 10 pounds… no Les Pauls for you I suppose. Seriously though, glad you’re doing so well ❤
Rick, I too had a mitral valve repair (in 2021), but my recovery wasn’t as quick, nor as easy as yours … it’s great to see you’re doing well!
rick is a strong hard worker
Every year?! Try every month
💪🏽🤙🏽
Good to hear you ate better!
I'm glad you're doing great. Many love this channel, you have many more years to go with this...................... God Bless
Glad your up n about so soon Rick. 👍👍
Prayers. RESPECT
God bless you. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Praying for you. Be well.
Rick, J am so glad you are doing well so quickly. I’ve watched dozens of your videos, enjoying especially the one you did right after Gordon Lightfoot’s passing (I am Canadian, too). But to hear you talk about your heart valve issue really struck a chord with me. I am 72 and was diagnosed 18 months ago with moderate atrial valve stenosis (the narrowing that allows the leak that makes a heart murmur sound). Last December, my cardiologist ran the tests on me again and now it’s at the serious level. Ironically, my semi-annual checkup with him is next week! I’m sure that open heart surgery will be the topic of discussion, although there are some newer techniques that are less invasive. Wish me luck! I hope that I get as good a result as you have. Keep up your very entertaining videos.
I'm so glad you're above the daisies Rick the world will be a different place if you weren't hanging around we need you here the music world need you here not to mention your family and stuff I'm so happy you're still here Rick bye
Rick, you look and sound great: Glad you're ok!
Get Well!
Rest up Rick and get well soon!
Heal up well. Wishing you the best. 👍🙂👍
I blame this on Autocorrect.    ;)  Get well soon Rick.
Glad to hear that all went well. I have a flutter in one of my valves. Doctors told me that it won’t be an issue until I’m in my 80s. I’ll be 56 this year and have known about the issue since I was 45. Hoping for surgical advancements by the time it becomes necessary.
Happy you are healthy, if it means anything, I personally enjoy your interviews more than the song breakdowns, just keep doing what you’re doing , it’s great!
I think you should do more episodes of "What makes this song great"
So glad Rick need you here on the Tube! Best recovery!
Good to hear your on the mend. Have you heard of a couple music themed movies; Lost Angel The Genius of Judee Sill and What the Hell Happened to Blood Sweat and Tears? Both original and revealing documentaries about the recent history of rock and roll that you may not known anything about. Would you think about adding music movies to your repertoire of musical reviews. Every year there a couple of movies where music is the subject and to me are as significant as a new album release.
That’s amazing
HAH! Had my prostate removed last Monday Rick. Going back in 2 days to get all the staples and pee bags, etc. removed. Live long and proper dude!
Rick, so happy you received the care you needed. All the very best because you are the best!
Glad it was success!
Bruh. Heal well.
We love you Rick.  Most of us take our health for granted, but I thank the Lord God regularly for my good health.  Poor health changes everything.  Glad you’re on the mend!  -Bill
Great stuff Rick, just keep doing your thing! Why not do a segment of how a song idea goes from start to finish with all your muso friends.
Stay well ... a world of musicians need you.
wow man....I am glad your back and ok. Stay healthy and take care of yourself Mr. beato! :) all the love man
So glad you are doing well!  Keep rockin!  Cheers!!
Hello, be well... greetings from Romania!
Great to hear you’re doing well, Rick!
Realy glad all went well. Take good care, Rick. You're important to a lot of people.
Glad to hear Rick!👍👍👍
Very glad that the surgery went well, and that you’re recovering so quickly! My dad had open-heart surgery while I was in college 30 years ago, and was in the hospital for at least a week before they let him go home. Granted, he was a life-long smoker and it was a triple-bypass, which was more complex than it sounds like yours was (though I’m not dismissing the seriousness of your surgery at all), but it’s still amazing how much things have advanced in three decades of medical technology. Take care!
Glad everything worked out for you brother.
Welcome to the "Zipper Club", aka heart surgery survivors!    Very glad that you made it.    Peace love and music. ☮️♥️🎶
Glad you getting better Rick. God bless you!
Get better dude!
Godbless! 62? I thought maybe 58. Keep on truckin!
Prayers for a complete recovery!
God bless you, Rick!
So glad your procedure went well! Wishing you a healthy happy future. ❤
Many blessings for a long and healthy life, Rick!
You are such a blessing to all of us out here. So grateful you are through that. What you do is important…thank you!
Get well soon, Rick.
My Cardio Doc say it’s very common and everybody leaks eventually.
Hey Rick.. I saw that thumbnail with you in the hospital bed and got a little bit nervous. I love watching your videos. Truthfully, you’re kind of like a friend to me that you don’t know you have 😝.  Please make sure that you take care of yourself and you keep making videos for a long time to come.  I like our friendship a lot 👍.  Wish you the best Rick.. I’m very happy to hear that you are alright ❤️
Rick!  Godspeed your complete recovery.  I, like four million other of your fans and students, love you too.
Just glad you're okay!
I had my valves changed. It didn't go well then to top it off the aortic valve has been RECALLED! Am I angry? Enough to give myself a heart attack!!
Thank God! Hope your recovery is at 100% also. Just thank the Lord Rick.
Welcome to the zipper club.
❤🙏
Rick you're a national F-ing treasure. I was worried at first when I saw you had an issue, but relieved that you're well.   Very happy to hear it.
Best wishes for a continued speedy recovery...
You make the world a better place. Relax and feel renewed🌷🌷🌷
You went to one of the best places in this country and they knocked it out of the park! Stay healthy, homie.
Have a great recovery!!!❤
Glad you are doing well. Your channel is the best channel on YouTube. I've learned so much watching this channel. And quite honestly, you make me feel proud that my name ends in a vowel.
Long life and great health, Rick!
Same age as you mate  your still young rock on, love your work from Burwood Sydney Australia ( where AC/DC Young bros  lived when they arrived from Scotland)
You and Austin McConnell, two YouTubers I subscribe to going through the same surgery (or similar, not sure if it was the same valve regurgitating) around the same time.
Wow!  Glad you're doing well!   2 people very close to me went in for cardiac surgery and didn't come out, so yeah.  Fear unlocked. One was my father, who had his first heart attack at 30. I'm now only 10 years younger than when he passed, so counting myself lucky. Knocking on wood, ('68 ES-335 for extra luck)  But seriously, glad you're ok!
Speedy recovery. I have learnt much from you.
glad you are doing fine after surgery. as to the channel I would say more of the same, love the interviews, song breakdowns, top ten stuff and of course the lessons! Maybe bring in another collaborator for some of this stuff, but not really needed.
Prayers and best wishes Rick!!
I'm glad you are doing well. Welcome to the zipper club!
Glad you're ok and on the mend.
Glad your procedure went well with zero complications. 👍
We love you, Rick.
Good luck Rick! Heal well!
Rick, Glad to hear your voice and feel your infectious energy. I’m 70 with regurgitating MVP as well. So far … mild. Glad we live in a time with top notch doctors and procedures. Heal well!
The progress in heart surgery has been a real success story. Cleveland Clinic has been the leading light. This is not what we would have see thirty years ago when I was still in that business. For those who hate western medicine I can only say: I hope you'll never need it. Glad to see you back, Rick!
Stay Healthy man... We need more REAL music insights.  Honestly.. You "look" different. Thin/gaunt.  The Body has been beat up.  Take it easy. re-examine the Body. Then RE- SET life.  Think
Do whatever you WANT on your channel, Rick. Just stay WITH us! Glad you are well.
Keep on rocking, man, you do a good job, there is a lot of people sending you the best energy.
Glad you're ok! This will 100% re-envigorate you!
Rick! Blessings and all the healing energy you can channel into that heart. Mine’s been overhauled twice, first time it was five stents, 15 years later, a triple bypass. Believe me, the knowledge that after 62 years you get a break to regroup is a marvel that will never leave you.   I’ve been enjoying every podcast, post and reel my subscription brings for several years. It’s such a boost to know you’re going to be well.
I'm heartened by your rapid recovery, Rick!
Curious if your sense of pitch has changed since your surgery - some others who had perfect pitch reported changes.   I know you are more great relative pitch but just curious if you noted any changes.
Welcome to Cleveland. We are the BEST here for heart surgeries. All the big names get fixed up here. Glad you’re on the right track!
The miracles on modern medical science. God bless the good doctors where you are. Get well. Heal well. I enjoy your channel.
Wonderful Rick good to know your having a fast recovery. God bless
prayers for continued good health
Rick have you ever thought of co hosting say for example with Stewart Copeland / Danny Carey on drum topics, Steve Lukather or Malmsreen  on guitars etc ? Just a thought about more content with input from industry professionals actually participating not just anecdotally but practically from their skills base/s ?seems obvious as they give a little bit I’m thinking content like say your circle of fifths video as an example more in depth as such not just historical anecdotal and a bit of a play to demonstrate singular pieces . May seem obvious but a drum lesson from Danny Carey or say a quick Bass lesson with Les Claypool????  Maybe even a a Viola lesson from Mary Spender ????
Glad you’re doing better
❤
Best of luck to you bro love your tube channel
Glad you're doing well.
❤
That's great news that it was a complete success.  My nephew (age 30) had similar surgery for a bad valve and has recovered nicely.
I'm glad your surgery went well, Rick.
Hey Rick, I hope you live a very very long life. The world needs more artists and educators such as your self.
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick!
good news!
Glad you are doing well Rick!
Get well soon Rick! We need more of your videos
Cent anni, Rick!
Glad to hear the good news! Pray you continue what you're doing!
All the best Rick! I love your channel and your love of music!
Did you make sure the doctors didn’t leave anything inside your chest it’s quite rare but can be dangerous if left unchecked
Dammit Hero!
Hey Rick, Glad to hear your ok and you will continue to get stronger! I had a complete AVR back in 2020 @ 52. I had the sternotomy and the whole nine yards, just as you did. And 4 years later I'm doing pretty damn good and playing music better than ever. It's amazing what doctors can do with all the technology these days, and all the prayers do too. Keep on rockin' and stay strong in your recovery!  Welcome to the Zipper club! Cheers!
This is advice that could save your life (it saved mine).  If you're feeling not well or indefinably odd and you're wondering if there's a problem, but you aren't so concerned as to call an ambulance, grab a book or something and go sit in the ER. If you're fine, you can go home, and it won't have cost you a penny. If you're not fine, you'll already be in the right place when you need help.  In my case, there was no pain at all. I felt odd (as if the love of my life had completely and utterly betrayed me, but there was no reason for that feeling) and so I went to the ER. A few minutes after I arrived, I noticed the other people in the waiting room were staring at me, so I went to the window to check in.   The receptionist looked up at me and asked, "Are you having a heart attack?".  They treated me immediately and so I survived my "widow-maker" heart attack with absolutely no heart damage. Only 12% of people who have one of those outside of a hospital survive at all.  I tell everyone this message, but it didn't save a friend of mine. He felt unwell after supper and went upstairs to lie down until he did feel better. When they checked on him, he was already dead. He lived closer to the hospital than I do and all he had to do was travel 10 minutes to save his life.
Excellent news! Glad you're here
Glad Youre Doing Great!
Good health to you Rick! Please do the videos that you enjoy doing the most.
Glad you're feeling well Rick! And as far as suggestions, I do miss "What makes this song great", that's what got me in to your channel.
Glad to hear you’re doing well. 👍🏻
Glad you're doing well Rick !
Glad you're better...now blast some Live Cream at 11!
Rock on Rick.
It took me a while to actually Love what you do, and I have learnt a lot from you. PLease get better. Think about this word Arrogancy, stay humble brother. I say it out of Love
GET WELL, PLEASE, RICK !! WE NEED YOU!! :)
So glad you are on the mend. Praying for a speedy recovery, God bless.
Thank God your OK !! All the best to you and yours...
Glad to see you're doing well Rick! YouTube needs you!
Hey Rick- take good care of that surgical site, that's the biggest "worry" let it heal very well, don't get over confident with lifting etc...once that's all good your golden. We need you right here!  RN 24yrs...p.s. I'd love to see more interviews and deep dives on lesser know but influential bands...The Descendents, Firehose/Mike Watt and the like!
My mom had a mitral valve replacement at 75. She lived  to 90. There's no reason Mr. Rick won't live another 20 years or more.
So glad you are doing well.  Blessings for a long and healthy life.  Keep on Truckin' :)
Welcome to your second life : )  I had triple bypass in 2020 and now you cannot even see a scar on my chest!
love you rick. congratulations on getting through your surgery so well. i wish you many years of health and music.  regarding your last question...i do think i miss the days where you did fewer interviews and more song breakdowns. i love both, though.
Welcome back to the land of the living and may you long remain with us Rick. I am a 65 year old Brit been playing since age 13 and I still get an awful lot from watching these. Also, my partner had open heart surgery in 2020 to remove a tumor, so we know exactly how that scar looks and all that goes with such issues !!
Glad all is well, better slow down on the 'Pete Townshend' antics.. :)
Glad it all went well for you!
Happy to hear you are ok Rick, take it easy mate.
Yaaaay! Glad everything went well :) love your videos
Great News Rick!  Here´s to great surgeons and out nations healthcare machine.
You're a badass Rick, best music channel on youtube hands down.
So glad to hear that your procedure went so smoothly and that you are back in action. You are definitely a national treasure! Keep on truckin’!
Man, wishing the best on your health! We need you for a long long time.  Best wishes from Panama
Congratulations on the successful surgery and the (so far) problem-free recovery. Hey, we're both 62! Glad you are feeling better and sincere wishes for a continues recovery.
Big fan. Obviously happy that the surgery was completely successful. You are a treasure to music lovers.  As to the channel, while I love the music analysis, nobody does better interviews than you. Things that stick out to me... the three interviews with the principals in The Police, Mike Mills, that crazy great interview with Kip Winger (talk about still waters running deep!). Keep doing what you're doing.
Either take care of yourself or clone yourself!
Glad you are well, Rick! God bless
So glad you are okay and that everything went according to plan!
I'm glad you are doing better
Damn, you had this major surgery only a week ago and you already look like it never even happened! I'm glad it went so well.
Cleveland clinic is the best
Wishing you a full recovery Rick. God bless, love your videos. 👍
Yay for living! Good to hear the videos will keep coming - oh, and also that you are well. lol
Glad you’re on the mend!
Glad you're on the mend. ❤
Rick so glad you're feeling better & the the operation was a success. My Creed is "Faith, Family & Friend's" & Stay Everso Close to Each 🙏🎸
Pig, Cow, or Teflon?  Great recovery and spirit...glad they got you restarted...go with the flow...bro.  Best wishes.   Oh could you do a video on tuning?
Glad you had it done. I am 65 and my heart is similar to you. stay well, and take care Rick.
Please in the future more song breakdowns!  Love interviews also, but would like to see more of a 50/50 split. Thanx!
Rick, are you sure it wasn't that last Spotify Top 10 you had to listen to that maybe brought this on?  😆 lol.  Get well soon!
Welcome to the zipper club! I’m thankful you have had such a successful surgery and recovery!
Very nice of you to open up and talk you your viewers like if they are your good friends. Simple, honest, real. Big hugs buddy.
Glad to hear that your surgery went well. I absolutely love your interviews. They are interesting and authentic. That’s my preference.
Very happy you are doing so well, Rick! The Cleveland Clinic is an amazing place.
Just keep doing online what makes you happy. Because that's what makes us happy! Glad to hear you're ok. Greetings from Rochester!!
I'm with ya on the heart health. Glad ur feeling good,probably ur great additude.
The best video this year. Great news, live long and proper Rick 🖖
I’m glad you are well. You keep making videos and I’ll be watching!
Glad you are feeling better and that everything went well. Cleveland Clinic was a good call. Here’s to a speedy and uneventful recovery!
Get better!
I guess you can't play the Les Paul (10 lbs), but the other guitars should be okay.  Glad your operation was successful. I suspect that you're going to feel a lot more energetic going forward--and I was having trouble keeping up already.
I love the interviews when it's someone I know.  I enjoy watching your song breakdowns and other stuff a lot too though.  Keep a good variety going.  Glad your health is ok.
Dear Sir, may you have a great recovery and your health improve
Blessings of ALLAH upon you
I’ve been a cardiac ICU and cardiac surgical nurse for most of my career, please respect those sternal precautions ! Worst thing that can happen in a cardiac surgery is a sternal separation or sternal wound infection. Take care!
Good to hear your doing well Rick....!!!!
"Damn, he became SO energetic now", I thought, and then realised I was watching at x1.25 speed XD
Congratulations! I hope you heal well. Live long and perspire!
❤😊 ✔️
Excellent sir. You are a brave man
You are so blessed to just..be alive! Glad you are up and about! Phenomenal!
So glad to hear you’re doing better!
Hey Rick! Wishing you a very healthy recovery! I'd love to see your tips and tricks when it comes to mixing, mastering, or any EQ/compression tips from a music production standpoint.
Hey Rick, happy to hear you're doing so well.  The Clinic is world class, just like you.  I went there myself to rule out a major illness.  A 2 hour appointment and they had it figured it out. If I have problems that are difficult to nail down, I head to The CLE.  Stay well, my friend!
Rick, thankful for your great recovery! Glad we'll all get to have you around to share the love of music.
All the best, Rick! Sternal precautions following these procedures can feel a bit limiting but thankfully playing guitar and piano/keys won’t be an issue or conflict with these guidelines! Keep making great things happen!
get well my bruthu, appreciate all that you do for music Boss !!!
Bless you, brother! Happy the surgery was so successful. 🙏🙏💪💪👏👏
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick. So you can play guitar over the next 5 weeks but no heavy metal? 😆
So glad you are great! I saw you liked one of my videos, so happy to made you laugh! Keep on rocking!
I like your videos Rick, but I truly don't get this need people have to share their private medical issues on social media. People do it on Facebook, too. I really don't get it.   They actually created privacy laws that made it a crime for doctors to share your private medical history with the general public, and yet you basically invite the entire world into the exam room to share the most intimate details of your health with perfect strangers???   IMO, you should consider taking these videos down. Stick to your forte... music.
I wish you the best and soon you will play good music and comment on good songs. God bless you. Please, read the bible. I am from Brazil.
You’re the man!!
Glad you’re getting better!  Thankful for your channel! God bless
Words can't really explain what you mean to all of us, your fans and students, and to your family! So very glad you got the surgery to keep you around for another 62 years! You're an inspiration and a national treasure! Stay strong! 🎸❤
Take care, Rick, and thank you.
Glad to hear you are well.... Thank God 😊
So happy to see you recovering so well!! And happy that you are able to do what you love so quickly. Just be careful.  We all will for sure be here waiting. God bless you sir!!
Glad you are back and better than ever. Keep up the good work!!
God bless, Rick, and best wishes for a full, successful recovery - heal well!
Get well soon Rick!!!  Lots of Love to you and your Family..
Love ya Rick.  Glad you are feeling better.
Congrats, Rick.    Good luck and good health.
5 years ago and had my aortic valve replaced at Cleveland Clinic at 42. Have to have it done again a few time unfortunately.
Mr. Beato, you are such an inspiration in so many ways. i have the Beato book, ear training etc. And it has helped me out so much that as of 6 years ago, I never played a bass. Now I am on the verge of being the next bass player in a local banc that has been around for 35 years. Your training helped me get there at 57 years old. My favorites of yours are your interviews, song breakdowns, and music theory relating to the fretboard. Love to see more of them. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, thank god that you are healthy. You're too good of a guy to not be around. Thank you for everything that you do. P.S. Can you teach me how to sing? I know.
Great to hear you are recovering well.  You're in good company: Mick Jagger has had valve replacement and Amy Grant has had open heart surgery.
I’m glad everything went well, and that you are feeling great now.❤️
Cmon man, don't overstress yourself. I hope we will be  watching new stuff from you 10 years from now. If I am still here... I turned 60 last year too and lived the rock and roll lifestyle for decades before I cooled down bit by bit ( just got tired of it I guess). Arthritis made guitar playing nearly impossible years ago , my left finger joints are crap and I love you for breaking down Van Halen songs  or do SD solos like Carlton, Graydon et al. But keep on making the lists, And don't mind the blockers. The Bohemian Rhapsody AWK Awk was beautiful years ago,  In the words of Black Oak Arkansas: Keep the Faith , We need it!
Happy to hear that you are doing well! 🤘🤘
Glad your surgery went well. Looking forward to your new content. ❤
My uncle was born with Mitral valve prolapse in 1930 or so. He never had surgery to repair it and it eventually killed him when he was 80 years old. He was frightened of the surgery. We are lucky to be living in an age where that type of surgery is so routine now, that a week after yours, you are already back to normal with a normal life expectancy. Cheers!
Great recovery! It’s a nice thought, that you will continue your service to music and music lovers.
Rick, so glad that you are doing well and the procedure was successful.🤘🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Great to see you back in the Studio dude...... Keep healthy... Peace N love....
Modern surgical procedures are absolutely amazing.  My wife is half bionic at this point.  Both hips and a mechanical disc replacement before age 50.  Glad you're taking care of yourself!
All the best Rick
It's good to see you, Rick! ❤
Get well, Rick. You are the best!
We really appreciate you. Thank you for caring to share the quality of content that you share here on your channel. Myself and my fellow musician friends really appreciate you. Glad you’re doing well and your procedure went well. Best to you and your family. ❤🎶
I’m 62, too. This hit home.  So Glad to hear all went well and you’re on the mend.
We love you
GoodGood... Glad you are well...
You’re very calm considering that it was pretty major surgery! Wishing you the best of health.  In terms of the direction of the channel, definitely more interviews - your long-form interviews have a depth to them that you don’t find elsewhere.  I love hearing musician to musician talking about how songs were conceived, constructed, the mechanics of it all, the recording process.
Get well soon, Rick. You are loved and you bring so much value, kindness and with a smile and beautiful approach. Stay blessed
Thoughts on direction for the channel:  We will appreciate you making the content that you enjoy making and that makes sense to you.  The interviews are great - I enjoy them!  But I subscribed when you were breaking songs down for "what makes this song great"  and I enjoyed that content as well.
Glad to hear you're doing okay.
Wishing you a speedy recovery. Love your work. Hope to view it for many years to come.
Glad you are OK and doing better. Do what you like the most. Whats important to you is the best for all of us. Keep up the good work.
Glad you are ok. Let's go to music❤🎸
So glad it went good, very common problem. Keep up the great show Rick!
Glad your good brother
Love ya buddy ! Keep up the Awesome work. Get well. Cam in Vancouver Canada.
Praying for your speedy recovery, Boss Rick 🙏
Cleveland?. The heart of Rock N' Roll. Seems appropriate. 🙂Great to hear you are doing well.
God Bless you, you are a treasure!
glad to ear good news Rick!!
Good to see you in good health, Rick, you and your YouTube channel are important to me.
Good to hear you are making a quick recovery. Keep up the excellent interviews and information on music
I couldn’t be happier for a fellow human being that I have never met. 🎸 💗  I’m not only glad to hear that Rick Beato’s mitral valve cardiac surgical recovery is as good as anyone can hope for but also that his attitude is just as amazingly strong and positive. He seems as clear and sharp as he’s ever been, if not a little more so. He does look thinner and stronger, probably due to presurgical fasting and slow resumption of a light diet after recovery. His energy level seems like he’s anxiously waiting for his cardiologist to give him the green light to lift more than 10 lbs even though he’s good to go picking up his guitar now (3 days post surgery).
My thoughts and prayers are with you with much respect from Australia 🦘
Happy to hear of your surgery success, Rick.  I enjoy you music videos so much and I praise God all is well!!
We all know you from your videos and would have never guessed you were going through this in your personal life. Man, everyone’s going through something and you just never know. Thank you for the reminder to give grace to people. You’re an inspiration, Rick!
welcome to the zipper club, rick. i had a cabg x3 in february of 2020. i'll never forget that first sneeze, oh lawd!  i was a wreck for a good month. for whatever reason, infection settled in among the top four sternal wires and they had to go back in and pull those out. the infection managed to stay, so they had to go back in again and scrub it out. i was awake for that one and it was... quite the experience.  glad your recovery is coming along so nicely. if we ever happen to meet, we'll have to compare scars. it's a thing.
Reading this in my "What Makes This Song Great?" t-shirt. So glad it went well. God bless!
Glad you're ok Rick. Glad to see you back home and well.
You know you need to interview the Wilson sisters now don’t you? ❤❤. Anyway great update, health comes first, or was it guitars first lol 😂
So glad you’re feeling better. You have a lot of interviews and “What makes this song great?” videos left in you.
💛
Let’s find the to 20 greatest songs that have the word HEART ❤️ in the title. I’ll start with Heart of stone by The Rolling Stones and Heart of glass by Blondie
Crazy! I hadn't heard about this.. So glad you're okay, your videos are freaking awesome! Excited to see what You've got coming up!
Modern medicine is a wonderful thing.  I had 3 stents placed in my heart in 2011.  Without them I never would have met my grandkids.  Celebrate life!
Keep going Rick, I'm happy you are back. Salute!!!
😊 be well
I feel you brother. I had my chest cracked open last week as well. Luckily the guitar is under 10lbs. Feel better!
So glad that you're ok! Wishing you a speedy continued recovery.
❤️
Glad that you are feeling better man, I love your videos
Glad you're feeling good. Keep up the great work you do.
I too am a member of the zipper club. Had my aortic valve replaced ten years ago at age 57. That surgery literally drained all the energy from me. What use to take me 45 minutes to do now takes me 3 days to accomplish. Just take it easy for a few weeks.
Godspeed, Rick! If this video had run 3:31 I believe we’d have seen a tear. You Tube is nothing without you.
Rick got hospitalised due to the heavy stress in finding good songs today.
I say ... Keep talking about how crappy modern music is. That's my favorite. 👍🏻
I think it's time to scout and promote new bands Rick.  There's some great one's out there. You could really kick off the new wave of rock and metal with your fan base.  Particularly during this AI/lack of record company interest.  You have the power!
My wife had her aortic valve and aortic arch replaced about 6 years ago. Open chest surgery just like yours, Rick. She just had her yearly check up a few weeks ago and is doing fine. She had hers done at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton Alberta, Canada. Fantastic doctors and nurses. You will be 100% in no time. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.
so happy you are OK…..
Hey Rick, I had open heart surgery to repair my aorta when I was22, I’m 34 now and it’s been a trip. I wish my recovery was as speedy as yours but it was more like 2 weeks for me before I was able to get up and out of bed without serious pain lol. I’m only writing this to share that it is a profound experience, and yeah, obviously life changes after.   Your videos have helped me understand theory, and opened my eyes to all kinds of genres I might not have been interested in otherwise. I just wanted to say to please make sure to check in with yourself mentally, your body knows it’s been through severe trauma, and when I was recovering I know I focused on the physical recovery with little thought for the emotional side. It caught up with me though and it was a lot to work through months after.  Im glad everything was successful, and I hope the rest of your recovery goes well. From one heart patient to another I wish you all the best. Looking forward to everything you will do in the future. Take care  P.S The Kenny Aronoff video was fantastic, I took lessons from him at San Jose pro drum when I started playing like 18 years ago and was super stoked to see him make an appearance on the channel
Stay healthy, Rick.  God bless.
God Bless Rick, you & your family are in our family’s thoughts & prayers man. You’re bouncing back amazingly well in my opinion. IYour good for another 40 years 👍🏼
Glad your doing better Rick. We love you and appreciate your hard work to educate us all.
This man is so devoted to music, his YouTube channel and his followers that just a few days after heart surgery his back at. Good to see you are doing well
Rick, so glad you were able to have a successful surgery brother. Prayers for you man.
you will be screaming at clouds in no time! I'd like to see you produce some recording music for beginners as technology has come so far, now many more average folk can be recording and sharing music.
Glad to see you are ok!!!!
Total fan of yours, Rick. I have been a music freak all my life and I find your analyses to be eye-opening and inspiring. Glad your doing well after your surgery.
You look good Rick! Happy to hear you’re doing well. I miss the top -0 Spotify vids
Glad that you are doing well 👏🙏
Praying for you sir!
Very good news to hear
Glad you’re doing well. 🙏  The world of musicians needs your channel. 🫡
....To a true human being, press on my friend, glad you got through this roadblock....
So glad you are on the mend!
Live long and prosper, Rick!   🤠
You are blessed to have had a great surgical staff to keep you going, just like we are blessed to have  you share your musical gifts with us. Continue to be well!
People like yourself make this world a wonderful place to be ❤️🙏🕊️
Glad you're OK..Love What Makes This song great....suggestion Hello It's Me...ambiguous keys
Great news, Rick. 💜 please introduce this gen to Joni Mitchell!
I had the same condition. Marc Gillinov was my surgeon 4 yrs ago ( during COVID outbreak) and was able to do robotic. I'm 56 now and doing great, my heart returned to normal size again finally. I had other complications with my lungs afterwards, but Cleveland Clinic surgeons and staff were amazing. So glad you went there for your ❤.  Cleveland Rocks and so do you!
Speedy recovery and all the best Rick. You're a jem.💎
Heal well Sir!!!
From one of your Aussie fans, wishing you all the very best. On and upwards mate.
Cleveland Clinic is the best! I’m from outside Detroit, and got diagnosed with colon cancer six years ago. Got the best surgeon in the world at CC. Surgically cured; no radiation, no chemo required! Can’t compliment them enough. We have many fine hospitals in Michigan, but if I ever required heart or digestive related surgery on the future, I would only have it performed at Cleveland Clinic! Do glad you had a great experience and are doing so well, Rick! ❤️
Modern Medicine , not always perfect of course , but how fortunate we are these days. Great to see you bounce back just like that!
Good luck, Rick!
Glad it went well. I’ve been waiting to get to the severe part for around 10 years. Doc never gave me a time line.
So happy everything went so smoothly for you Rick! 🙏🏻
Welcome back. Glad it all went well. As for a suggestion, what abot more features on vocalists, best vocal groups and the like.
So pleased your heart is working better. You look well but have lost a little weight. Take care of yourself and family.😊
Definitely more 'break down' songs - they are awesome!
Wow. That's unreal. I had quadruple bypass 8 years ago and It took a couple of months just to walk a mile.
Happy day
Glad to see you recovering so well!!
❤
The world needs you. You better shape up Rick!
I'm just grateful to hear your surgery was a success. Glad you're feeling well so soon after!
I am 63 and just had triple bypass surgery. I feel you brother. Love your channel.
Glad to hear that everything is fine, Rick. Keep it rollin'!
Estimado Rick, qué alegría saber que te hayas recuperado... se te ve BIEN!!! Te escribo desde Argentina y te sigo desde hace mucho tiempo pero nunca subí comentarios del excelente material que ofreces a través de este canal, por eso aprovecho ahora para expresártelo y multiplicarlo por mil, además tu situación de salud lo ameritaba. A seguir entreteniéndonos con tus videos. Abrazo fuerte!
So good to see you back and recovering so quickly and well. Thank you for so many great insightful videos, and may there be many, many more to come.
I had same issue. I also had heart transplant when things got worse and have a scar running down my chest.  So I understand your issues with medical.   Glad you’re feeling better.
I really wish u guys hadn’t trusted Dr Fauci.
Congrats on your sucessful surgery! You sound great, can't wait for the next update. Wishing you a complete recovery.
Loved the session episode where you recorded a song it was great.
I am your age. Thank you for reminding me that I should go get checked out. Rest, my brother and get well. Health is everything. 🙂
Very happy that you’re well!!!  Take care of yourself!!!  I appreciate your talent and your willingness to share with all of us that tune into your channel.
I'm glad for the good news!
Glad you are well Rick,  take it easy🙏 Just don't lift up any  Les Pauls 😂
Hey Rick…glad you’re doing well and on the mend…all the best to you
Wow, heal quickly and fully.
I'm glad all went well.   You're such a happy guy.
Rick! Glad you're doing better!  Potential suggestion for upcoming content -- Genre breakdowns. Like, picking a genre or subgenre, going over the notable artists from it, giving a history, breaking down examples of the musicality, etc. Might be worth a go, eh?
Glad you're doing well, Rick. Wishing for a speedy recovery. :)
GBU ON A GOOD LONG LIFE😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Glad you’re ok Rick .
I am so glad your procedure went well Rick. you ARE a national treasure. You are appreciated by many, many people, including myself. Thank you for all you do and your contribution to the world of music. Everyone should be so generous. I wish you good health and a long life!
Step 1. Don't weigh your guitars.
Gr8 news Rick so happy for you you look good so  have a fresh start stay safe Rick can’t wait for your next vid  Just hit cruise mode 😊😊😊
I am not a musician and do not follow the topic all that much other than a few videos that catch my attention. Yours have been at the top of the list, especially the top 10 or analysis of styles of different instruments.  I am glad you are doing well and hope to keep seeing your work on my feed for years to come.
Glad to hear it and your quick recovery.  Love your channel and content.
🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
I am glad you're on the mend, Rick. I'm praying for your full recovery. I enjoy your channel. God bless.
So glad you're feeling better and on the mend!
Im very grateful your ok,, i lost my wife of 39 years to covid and she said that I need a Gretsch!!!!! I have Gibson and fender guitars everywhere and we worked showes in Albuquerque 75 miles from home and I did forklifts and she did everything else.  I found a Gretsch Brian Setzer and I love it because she put it in front of me and I miss my Sonya so much but I know she's still supporting me and my music,, stay well my friend!!!!😢
Stay well.
Glad you're fine, Rick! Greetings!
Get well soon!
❤
Glad you got thru it, Brutha!
Glad to hear it went really well Rick! Love you and your channel! Keep up the great content! 😊
I am VERY happy you are back and looking so perky! You bring a lot of pleasure, entertainment and education to legions of players like myself. Thank you!
Glad you're ok, love your Chanel and personality . You are great and down to earth. Thank you for all you do . Watching from Vancouver Island 🇨🇦👏👏👏  Take care
my Dad had a Mitral valve prolapse at one point
Well wishes Ric!
Hey there Rick, I’ve been a longtime subscriber and an avid watcher of your channel. Thank you for the update and I’m soooooo happy it all went well for you. Best wishes from Australia where I know you have many fans. Any musos I talk to know who you are.  Cheers mate! 😎🎶
Speedy recovery,  keep up the great videos
You’re all good Rick, NO DRAMAS 👍.
I’m 62, too!
Best wishes Rick, stay healthy!
Get well brother! I’d love to see your opinion on some of the outstanding young drummers on YouTube,Caleb,Nandi Bushell,Avery drummer Molek.
Glad you are doing good! All the best!
Glad you are doing well!
Hey Rick! Big time fan here. I am so glad that you are doing superb!! I would like to see more drum gear and drums reviews please. At least some reviews and critiques on music gear in general, like guitar pedals or whatnot. It can be like several gears in one video or just one magnificent gear on a single video I guess. Anyway so good to see your surgery went perfectly and you are safe and sound!! Love.
Take care!!
i always like your "what makes this song great" moments. Especially if it is a song I know.
Rick, first off hey man congrats on the speedy recovery thus far! Your channel has been nothing but captivating over these years, so, I dunno maybe try to jam with Middle Aged Dad Jam Band next time you're in LA?! Do whatever makes you happy, because it makes the world happy.
Love you Rick !   Take care
Glad things went well. Heal up and take care. :)
So glad you're doing well. I've been watching for only a few months but really love your videos. The night mood lighting, marshals & gold glow is really a comfortable, peaceful atmosphere. Take care and keep on keeping on✌️🤟🤘
Love you, buddy I'm 63 and terrified of the same. I know it's coming. I can feel it. Glad to hear that it was so quick and easy.
Watching this on my hospital bed after my colonoscopy which is no where near what you had to go through. Great to hear Rick! Keep chugging! Would love more What Makes This Song Great vids. Something from 2019's Fear Inoculum would be perfect.
You look good, Rick.  Never would’ve guessed you just had open-heart surgery.  As for the channel, I would love to see just interviews - engineers, composers, musicians.  Music theory is ok, but it’ll be around forever.  Some of the talent, stories, and wisdom won’t be.
Welcome home, man!
Glad to hear the outcome brother, God Bless!
Glad you're doing well.
Please consider an episode with an interview with the great Brent Mason.
First time hearing about this.  Glad to see that you are well, and wishing you a continued successful recovery!!!  😎🤘
Rick, it doesn’t matter what videos you do going forward. The fact that you will be able to do them for many years to come is what matters!
wishing you all the best you are a legend
I had open heart at the Cleveland Clinic in 1988 and I am still here. Rick, be gentle with yourself as you learn to trust your heart again.
Rick, I had the mitral valve repair done 12 years ago at age 52.  The good news is that it's done.  The younger and healthier you are when it's done the easier your recovery will be.  I was back on the ice playing hockey within 3 months.   All the best, you look great in the video.  Much better than I did one week after.😀
Don’t pick up any 70s Les Paul’s now.
🙏glad you made it ...welcome to the club ...😉😊😎👍
God blessed you Rick …and that exceptional medical team that took care of you!  So happy to hear that you are doing so well.       The interviews that you have done this last year are just astounding….you have such a gift to ask such great questions of the artists who have been guests that open them up so honestly to see them in such a relaxed yet intimate setting …for me, the Sting interview was jaw dropping….the surprising depth of his responses was amazing, but I impressed how he listened to your questions so intently, clearly respecting your musical knowledge and preparation for the talks…This continues in all of the additional artists that you talked to…..George Benson….incredible….another personal favorite ……clearly your work and reputation is getting around and opening up doors for more artists to be willing to sit down with you …..what a treat for us viewers.
Praying for your full and speedy recovery, Rick. I'm glad that the surgery went off perfectly without a hitch. Love to you, my friend. And to the amazingly wonderful work you do and give on this channel! Be well, brother!
Man glad your ok bud! A friend of mine about your age just went and had very similar done on his heart and hes back and going good too so im sure your good to go! Rest up and play lots of guitar! Dr's orders lol. Rock on my friend!
Happy to hear you’re on the mend. ❤️
I had emergency open heart surgery in 1999 (May). By the end of June, I was out camping. Sneezes that came out of nowhere were the worst for the first couple weeks. The HL bypass machine did a whammy on my short-term memory for about 10 months or so. Modern medicine is amazing.  Heal well and quickly, sir!
Rick, brother. Sir, you are cherished. Be well, be blessed, and heal up! I'm not on IG, so this is the first I've heard about the health issues. My goodness, brother, this is a shock! You're in my prayers, man.
I'm glad that you are well, Rick.
Wow !! .. Glad your surgery was successful Rick.. and that you chose the Cleveland Clinic. .. They saved both my parents so very long ago there in my hometown..  .. You're part of my daily routine here and like millions of others would agree.. you've become the friend we cherish in our lives who we can depend on for an ever pleasant and insightful learning experience.. All this time we knew you were putting your heart into it.. so were blessed that your metronome is back up to par for you.. .. Thank You Always and All Ways Rick.. .. There should be a spot for you in that Rock n Roll Hall of Fame that we all dream of.. Kudos and Best of Health to You and Yours 💚
All this could be avoid it if you drink CDS and Zeolite.
So happy that you're back and feeling well.   Looking forward to you excellent work.
Good healing, Rick!  My thoughts and prayers are with you!
Glad you're doing well!  Take care Rick.
So glad you’re well ❤
I don't trust sorcerers and magicians.
Glad you're ok, brohammer. And like John Oneill said below, you are a national treasure, man........to us musician/songwriters. Hang tough, sir!
I speak for many when I say Happy that your home and doing better brother. You Rock!
Rick, I'm 48 days out on mitral valve replacement, mine could not be repaired. With cardiac rehab two days a week my ability to function as a normal 65yo active adult has returned. I'm sure we have had a similar outcome  from surgery. They fixed me!!
I am glad you are recovering well from your recent surgery and wish you many more years of health and happiness. I enjoy learning  about popular music on your channel. I hope you will continue sharing your musical journey with us for many more years. Best wishes from  Hamilton Ontario.
sending you wishes for good health going forward, Rick!
I have been reading your brilliant stuff for a while. Glad you will be around to do this some more. Praying and wishing only good things for you.
This revelation gives me the jitters. A lot of fans, including me, care about Rick enough to be devastated if his health took a turn for the worse.
So glad to hear everything came out great for you Rick. BTW... have you lost weight recently?! You look thinner to  me...?
Rick, you're  the best  communicator and teacher, and not just about music!  I do mitral valve repairs for a living and could not have explained it better than you - certainly not from the patient perspective. Glad to hear (and see) you're recovering well.  Take your time, we can wait a while for the next video.  And I'll be sending my patients to your channel for your regular dose of inspiration and explanation in equal measures.
I'm so happy your surgery was a total success! I a m looking forward to many, many more years of your amazing videos; especially "What makes this song great" videos
Good to see you're doing so well. That would have scared the living hell out of me. Love your Channel continue to mend.
Glad they got you all fixed up Rick and that you are recovering well!
Glad you are okay.  I wish you the best of health and looking forward to see you for many years to come on Youtube.
i am happy that everything went well, keep it up Rick, all the best for you. Stay well and take care of yourself, the years dont go by without the one or the other issue. But i am amazed how fast after surgery your back on your feet.
Imagine being 1 of Rick's nurses as he berates her for not knowing that the song playing is out of tune  How could she know if she's never heard the song before? 😏 😏 😏
Glad you're doing well!!! Music heals
Thank you for sharing your experience Rick and so good to see you back again! Best wishes for your recovery and looking forward to your next interview. Your channel is amazing! Thank you 🙏❤️😊
You're a light in this world, and I am very happy to hear your surgery went so well, that you're back, and that you feel good! I love everything you do, so it's hard to pick and choose, but since you haven't had any song breakdowns in a while, I'd look forward to that.
Thinking of you Rick. Here's to a speedy recovery.
So happy you are okay.  10lbs...don't go playing any 70's Gibson Norlins!
We should be “blood brothers” Rick! In April of 2021 I had an episode with heart failure and was rushed to the Cleveland Clinic for treatment. I also have a leaky valve. The Cardiolgy doctors took good care of me and three years later, I’m doing well. Good news to hear for you! Gianni❤ PS: You live in Cleveland or near here?
Good luck, Rick.  I'm a few years older than you and last Thursday I got my fifth, sixth, and seventh stents. As Huey says,  the heart of rock and roll is still beating!
So glad you’re doing alright.   From Mexico love your videos, your interviews are the best.
😊🎉❤ Great news! Cheers to vibrant good health!
Excellent news and keep motoring on!
Glad you are doing well. I appreciate you. All the best, Rick!
Glad to hear you're on the mend man.
Glad you are doing well.
Keep moving forward Rick! I’m 13 and whenever you upload, it’s a good day for me and I look up to those like you as I picked up a guitar a little over a year ago and I’m very committed towards it. Anyway, keep on doing what you do and never stop!
Thaaaaank goodness!! Whew!! No more scary stuff, okay?? PS, I’ll watch ANY video of yours. If you find it interesting, I’m in… 🙂
Love ya Rick - your talent is amazing!  you have given thousands of us fans so much teaching and appreciation for great songs.  God Bless! Keep on a Rockin me baby!  Take it Easy!
Rick, wishing you the very best for a speedy and full recovery! Thank you for the outstanding videos you make.
Contentos de que estés mejor. 😎 ¡ A recuperarse ese gran corazón!
Glad you’re feeling good Rick!
As problematic as modern medicine can be…..it borders on miraculous what we can do in surgery now!! Glad you’re good!!   I had been going thru great musicians / bands who never had the recognition they deserved! That would be a great series and expose younger fans to these folk!! A good example…. Edgar Winters White Trash….unbelievable live performances…great musicians and a whole lotta drama!!
I'm glad you're okay. I've learned a lot about the music I love from your channel!
just for the awareness. Cleveland Clinic is probably the greatest medical institution on the planet currently. for renal and cardiovascular care, its just insane how far beyond they are in surgical care and in surgical talent than anywhere on the globe.
Great new, all the best mate with the recovery - 100% soon👍😊
good luck, buddy..love watching your channel.....best of luck in the future...
Happy you’re well! Would love to connect the theory you offer and applying it to songwriting from a creative standpoint. Like, think about *this* when you’re writing next song.
Glad you're doing well!
Glad it turned out well 🙏🏼
I'm glad youre still with us. I personally like all the things you do with this channel. I think I became a fan with the Bernard Purdie interview and it's still one of my favorite interviews you did. I also love the song breakdowns because it causes me to consider things about songs I love that I might not have considered before. I also love when you hang out with Tim Pierce.
I am glad you're doing well! Best of health to you and your family.
A very good friend is a perfusionist (they run the heart and lung machine) professor.  It’s an amazing world we live in! Glad you’re doing well Rick!
At 62, you have plenty of time,  just none to waste. Continue to enjoy what you love to do, and let us be part of it.
I just had the same surgery on July 3rd. Wish I was healing up faster. If I cough it still hurts pretty bad. But you look like you're doing great. Wish you all the best and I always love your videos. 😀
Wow, so glad you cruised through your operation! We just love your stuff, and for my money you can't do too many song breakdowns, they are epic. Mark
I am glad your surgery was a success.   As far as content for the future, I love the interviews; I dislike the sky-is-falling-here's-why-music-is-no-longer-good stuff.  You're in an incredible position to promote music - wow! What a great thing to be able to do. You have reach, you have an impact. You can promote music without simultaneously taking down other music.
Good to hear you are back and everything turned out well ❤ Good bless you
Rick God Bless you and keep you safe.  Here is to a speedy recovery! Love your channel.
Keep on rockin', my friend. Same age as you and I just had a heart valve replacement with the same results. I feel energetic and thankful I was able to come out of it to see my kids graduate from college.  Like you, music hs kept me alive and well. Kindred spirits indeed. Loven your channel and you knowledge. Peace ! 👍👍
Great seeing you. I love your channel and everything I learn watching your videos. Wish you a prompt recovery
Good to hear that you feel good, keep getting well!
Great to hear it went so well.
Rick, excellent news! Keep up the good work.
I am 70 year old and about 3 weeks ago I had a Heart Ablation for SVT Supra Ventricular Tachycardias. This is where your heart  will palpitate or race for apparent reason as much as a 170 BPM. I had an Electrophysiologist preform the procedure. The stray electrical tissue  was between my two ventricles. he disabled it using a caterer which uses radiofrequency to destroy the small amounts of tissue causing the abnormal heart beat.
Awesome rick!  Hope you continue to feel great!
Dear Rick, have a quick and safe recovery !
I'm in the same boat with my aortic valve.  Glad it went well for you.
Hope you are well and renewed, Rick.
Take care and get better soon!
Glad you’re doing well Rick.
Glad to see you’re doing well Rick! Keep that metronome ticking brother!🤘
Glad you're on the mend mate! God bless, keep makin the great vids man!
Just get better and keep providing g us with your great insite to music!
I'm glad you're well. More song breakdowns.
With all the equipment behind you, I’d like to see more stories about the impact different pieces of equipment has had on music, bands and musicians.  For instance, the story on how Tom Scholz developed the Rockman pedal and what it did for Boston’s signature sound. But the story I’d most like to see is about the Leslie speaker and the impact it has had on so many genres of music, including rock. That Don Leslie, the inventor, was not inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame before he died, is criminal. And he still hasn’t been inducted. Thankful you’re doing so well following surgery.❤
Rick thank you for sharing that. I am 69, had a stroke which affected the dexterity in my right hand. Can't play sax as well as I used to. I had a leaking heart valve probably since birth. Doctor said surgery was optional. Love you. Keep up the good work.
So happy you’re doing well!  I can’t believe you’re making videos just a week out of surgery!  As far as direction of the channel, I love the interviews, but would  love to see guests join in on your top ten reviews or what this song greats.  Would especially love to see more producers and engineers talk about how top ten songs are produced now.
God, please continue to bless.
Glad you sailed through it. You went to this country's finest heart tech location so you did the right thing.
Rick, I'll be 70 next month. I'm going to tell you like I tell my older physicians, you can't retire or expire for as long as I still need your services.
Thank you for being so open with us.  Wow, that's a lot!  * whew! *
get that jimmy page interview!
You and I are the same age and it’s now that the health issues are popping up. All the best in your recovery.
So happy for you.
I’m sure you’ll be fine,man.Here’s to another 62 years.Keep up the walking(great habit)and please stay away from Holdsworth.It’s just not worth it.👍💐👽
Did you bias the new EL34 valve, joking…I had similar symptoms, general malaise….next thing heart attack…emergency surgery…it works…started to appreciate more music and life.
Sending Good  Vibes!    Be Well Good Friend.
Hey Rick,  Nice to see well again, good vibes from Brazil for you my friend, God bless you always.🤟🤘
Great to hear your doing well.  Going forward, I would like to see more song analysis, and more music theory especially as it applies to specific pieces of music.  I've loved the interviews, though, especially the ones with people I've never heard of!  So I guess the solution is for you to work twice as hard now that you've had your surgery !
Godspeed
Rick, don't try to pick up a resonator guitar! Get well :)
Glad your feeling better get better soon
Best wishes, keep on bringing joy to people
I am glad to hear you're bouncing back so quickly!   I saw your post the other day and was worried.  Your channel has been a great benefit to my knowledge skills and abilities as a musician... I actually work at a cardiology clinic so I found this video very interesting.  Get well soon Rick !
keep alive, keep doing the AMAZING work, all the good!
Glad to hear you're on the "up" Rick. Good luck from Australia!
your first doctor was a chump for not repairing the valve while it was asymptomatic.  Maybe it could have been done robotically.
Also, some interesting ideas on “What makes this song great,” I’m a huge Buddy Holly fan, old rock and roll music. I’d love to see a break down of “Raining in My Heart” or some Roy Orbison, Elvis stuff
so glad your on the mend RICK, you take care ok  from a fan in Liverpool UK .
Glad to hear you’re going well.
praise God!
Best Wishes My Friend!❤
Rick, glad to hear that your surgery was a success. Take it slow and keep working on your recovery. Take care and God bless you and the family.
I was hoping to see an "arc reactor" iron man. Glad everthing worked out!
Same here! I have a mitral valve failure. It could be too much rock & roll. But I’m ok. I'm really glad you're doing well!!!
Hey Rick I had a quadruple bi-pass the same day it too was successful and am on the way to full recovery. Now I will be adding guitar pratice to my healing routine. Best of luck and I will be waiting for new content
Emory is a great hospital, but I think Cleveland Clinic is the better choice for heart surgery. (my wife would actually know. She worked in the Clifton Rd ER for 15 years).
Glad you’re doing well
This middle aged punk rocker loves you brother, glad to see you still vertical! Love from Texas
Happy, you're okay, Rick. That had to be scary. You asked for ideas.  "Why We Love the Bands We Love" Every band has a particular sound that is unique or identifiable, I think of, say, Rush vs Pink Floyd or the Beatles vs AC/DC. Not a competition, but rather what is it about their music formula that draws the listener in. It is a particular chord progression or time signature, a lyrical point of view or vocal technique that makes them instantly recognizable. Not so much about an individual song, but about their sound, instrument choice, production. What is it about them that makes them, them. I think an overview of why that is, and how that is, would be interesting and informative to the average listener.
Great to see you are on the mend Rick.  My wife had mittral valve repair a few years ago and we have not stopped doing what we did in our earlier days.  I really enjoy your content so don't have input on what to change however the only piece to keep to keep in front of you - don't vear off into a subject that has a political tone.......just a no win.  Again - great to see you "rockin and rolling"!
Get well soon fellow Atlantian.
Here’s to you health!  Keep doing what you’re doing.
Congrats on getting back up and going so quickly! That's great news
Glad you sailed through. I hear a little hoarseness left over, should go away (I am an otolaryngologist, sorry to geek out!)
Glad to hear you're ok Rick! I'd love to hear you break down some of the 90s SoCal punk scene, in particular FatWreck label. They have some amazing bands on their label and even more incredible musicians. Some proper guitar shredders in bands like Propaghandi, Strung Out and Nofx to name a couple. Be cool to see you interview some of the key players from that scene.
Great to know you're back., Rick  Let's keep ahead. What about some reviews on Brazilian Music for future plans? I know you like good music.  We have good stuff around here
Great news! Glad to know the surgery went well. Advice: Don't sneeze! 😁
Rick, glad to hear the surgery was a success and you recovery's going well.  I'm in the same recovery mode as you are right now, same restrictions, incisions, etc. I had open heart surgery (4x bypass) on July 3rd and was discharged on the 8th, my 60th birthday. Be  patient, make the most of the days ahead, enjoy your family! Been following the channel pretty much from the beginning. I appreciate your work. God bless!
Wishing for a speedy recovery.  I love every segment.  How about a little bit of it all.  What makes this song great, breakdown, the what if segments of other musicians playing someone else's music as well as interviews.  All the material you do is dynamite.  I will watch it all!
Hello, you should do more interviews it inspired me a lot a learn many new things on your channel. Keep it safe, be healthy.
Hey Rick,  I liked your couple of videos recently about the difference between the music and music industry now versus 50 or so years ago.  One thing that rang true was that scarcity used to play a part in enhancing music--it took quite an effort to get it and rarely would regular people venture into a recording studio.  It was scarce and sought-after.  Now it is like gravel underfoot, and almost anyone can afford studio time.  And I guess the old way of things meant that the only music available to physically go and get was generally excellent music, because it had to sell to pay off for the long line of people involved.  So that has not changed.  Excellence is still scarce, excellent music is still sought after, but finding it is now a different process, where you have to sort through a big pile of songs online, unless one wants to follow the shiny objects that point to what is supposed to be excellent.
Keep on keepin on Rick!!!
Rick, I’m glad the surgery was successful and uneventful and that your recovery is the same. Blessings to you and your family!
That is great news, Rick!  The Cleveland Clinic rocks!  They have helped me tremendously in the past year.  I'm glad I live in NE Ohio, and I'm glad you enjoyed getting some visiting time in Cleveland.
Best wishes man and I love ur channel keep on Rocking
Glad you are making a good recovery Rick. All the best from Australia. 👍💞
Health first Rick.  I'm 65 with cardiac issues too. I can never return to work and SS disability denied my claim as they feel at 65, I can start a new career.  I'm skilled trades, heavy truck mechanic. Been doing it since 1978.  My lawyers have filed an appeal.  Heal up, I'm working to get the dexterity back in my hands so I can play again.  We can wait until you're healed.
Glad to see you're doing well.
Good thing the Rick Beato signature Les Paul Special is a 6#’er 😅😂
Glad to know everything it’s ok Rick, take care!
Great to hear you are doing well.
Maybe it was your heart acting up that made you hard on new music recently... maybe now you'll be able to listen to some great new music with an open heart 😉 perhaps a collab with some other YouTubers where they play you the recent stuff they're most into? Let's call it the Open Heart Sessions!
So glad you’re doing well. You’re looking great! Welcome back and all the best to you and your family!
I'm 62 too I'm glad you made it thru Rick
Cheers mate on the new diggs! Safe healing!  I'm originally from Douglasville and have lived in Asheville now for 20 yrs. Exceptional content!
Damn dude...keep care of yourself
Be well, Rick. Take time to heal! It's hard to do, especially if you're feeling great! God bless!
I'm glad you're doing alright Rick, Praise God!
Glad for you! We really need to take time to admire and be thankful to these amazing doctors who save lives every day. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Very happy you are doing well. All the best. Really love both your channels.
Sorry to hear it, dude. Get well.
Glad that you are OK. Pleas continue the grate job that you do.
Great news Rick.
Progress is amazing. Not quite  laparoscopic same day get outta here type stuff but still. Remarkable to think about.We are grateful
"Jaded heart"  by  Dokken  Had  some  great  sliding  base  lines by  jeff  pilson.   well   wishes to  you  and  good  health !
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍🏼😎
Glad you are okay Rick.
Glad you’re better. Glad it was a smooth surgery ❤
Take good care of your health! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Doc wants me to go to the cardiologist. Been putting it off, I feel ok. I'll go. I would like to see another Steven Wilson interview focused more on his music this time. Good to hear you're ok, Rick.
Welcome back!!!  Best wishes for your health!!!
Great to hear you are doing well Rick!
Thank you for the update and it is wonderful news that you have come through this in great shape.
Sending Best Wishes !
Get well sir
Bless you and get well.
All the best bro
Good to hear you are doing OK. I'm a bit older than you and my Dr. is keeping an eye on my heart. Echocardiograms every year. Take care of yourself. And. I do enjoy you song breakdown videos. I have a very minimal level (to be almost non-existent) of musical training. So I hear a song, I like the song, but I don't know why. Watching to your videos Is helping me to listen more critically and understand what it is I really like in a good song. Adam Reader, Professor of Rock, is another Youtuber that I also watch.
Be well, no meat sauces, steak, no fatty foods :)
Good news, glad you’re doing well.
Glad to hear you got it taken care of. I appreciate you, my friend.
Glad to see you very well Rick
Glad to see such a quick recovery, long live Rick
Glad you are doing well. There is more for you to do, clearly.
Speedy recovery. Keep up the excellent work Mr. Beato, very inspiring. Best wishes from Monterrey, Mexico..!!!
Rick, take the recovery instructions seriously and get well soon!  You see how many lives you touch. Keep up the good work.
Glad your health is better.
Health to you friend
I was curious! Thank you for sharing!
So pleased it went well Rick.
Man! So glad you are on the mend and will be staying with us for much, much longer brother!
👍🏼🙏🏻
Glad to hear you are ok✌🏻
Glad your surgery went well! Combining interviews with big-name musicians and breakdowns of their songs offers a unique perspective that can really engage viewers. It not only provides insights into the music-making process but also deepens appreciation for the artists and their work. Plus, having the actual musicians involved in the breakdowns adds authenticity and insider knowledge that viewers would find valuable and fascinating. It's a great way to connect on multiple levels, Love your channel.
So good to hear you're doing great!
Welcome to The Zipper Club. So, nothing funny for a while, laughing will hurt, and don't use chairs with armrests, you will automatically use them when standing up and it'll hurt for a few months.
I am so grateful you are back and feeling better and this ordeal is behind you.  Long may you play.  I watch your videos regularly and recommend them to all the music students I coach, as well as colleagues, and friends.
Glad you enjoyed my hometown of Cleveland. In addition to its many treasures, Cleveland just happens to have two of the premier hospitals in the WORLD for Cardiac Care- The Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospital. Hope you are well, and visit our fair city more often
Modern healthcare is amazing, glad everything went well!
All the best wishes for you sir.
Glad to hear all went well and your recovery is well underway, wishing you even better health after your recovery!
Hey Rick hope you will recuperate smoothly. We are gonna be here waiting for your great videos...Take good care!
Glad youare better brother!!! love the channel!!!
I'm happy you are doing well!  As far as content for your channel going forward, I'd love to see more "What Makes This Song Great?" videos.  Thank you so much, Rick!, for all that you do!!
Dude I had major surgery 1 year ago (29th of June 2023).  Rick I'm a big fan I'm sorry you went through that. You've given me a lot of sweet entertainment with your chanel. I am also a guitar player and "game recognize game" you do a great service to you tube and all of your friends... I salute you.
God bless you, Rick. You hang in there. Thank you for all you contribute to music.
Glad your on the mend Rick
Dearest Rick, I pray for your complete recovery!! 🙏🏼  You have helped a lot of people including me, to expand our love and knowledge of music. Thank you very very much!! 🙏🏼
Glad all went well, hope you have a swift recovery!
Get well soon Rick! We need you!
Very happy to hear everything was successful.
Just picked this up.  Rick, I am so grateful that it all went well.  I am 70, play a little guitar, but alot of drums, and follow your videos and wisdom and great perspectives on music, but also life and things that are important.  I've had major surgeries that seem to appear at the later part of life (I would like to say MID stages of life), and have been blessed by some of the best doctors in the world.  The Cleveland Clinic is world-class and I am so happy to hear that you've been in good hands.    Take it mellow, well kinda take it mellow.  Nuff said.  I am just so happy that you are well and we all get to have you.    Take care, Jim from Calfornia
Glad to see you feeling upbeat again. Love to see more WMTSG! Be well…
Im glad to hear you are recovering well!
Be well, Rick!  Thank you for your channel. I greatly appreciate the song breakdowns and analyses and would enjoy seeing more in the future.
Always opt for the pig valve when possible.  Then you can root for your own truffles!  Just kidding.  I had my mitral replaced at Penn Medicine in 2012.  You're going to be with us for a long time!  Do your rehab!
Glad your on the mend, I'm in my 50s now and I get checked regularly just in case.
I've been loving the interview videos this year! Glad you are doing well!
So glad you are doing well Rick!!
<3
wishing you a speedy recovery!
Wishing you many years of help and happiness.   Blessings to you and your family.
Thank you for sharing your story.  Heal well Rick.  We love you!
Glad you are well, and recovery has been so easy.
Glad you are doing well!  I had a prolapsed mitral valve with severe regurgitation as well.  Last year my cardiologists were able to fix it with mitra clips that were inserted via a catheter through the groin. I was up and about the next day.  Today's medical technology is amazing.  Keep up your great videos!
I'm so glad you'e dong well, and as always I look forward to many more Rick Beato presentations.....BTW, I'd love to see you interview  accomplished artist who play stringed instruments other than guitar
My condolences on your financial loss, as you live in the one civilised developed nation on Earth that ransoms the health of its citizens for insanely exploitative private profiteering.  (This is not to say, as we're being honest, that profit is not present in other healthcare systems around the world, of course, but it's not the outright "every penny we can extract" scam that is the American healthcare system.  Like, $2,000 for an ambulance in some states? How can you make a glorified taxi service that expensive, even if you tried? What fuel are they putting into the fuel tanks of those ambulances to make $2,000 remotely reasonable? Unicorn tears? Are the ambulances made of gold? It's utterly ridiculous and amounts to extortion, frankly, of vulnerable people who can't exactly help the health condition that afflicts them 90% of the time.)  And, for all that expense, you only get middling health outcomes compared to the rest of the world as well. You're not even getting more for your money for paying vastly, vastly more than anyone else on planet Earth ever does.  But glad to hear you're on the mend, Rick.
Glad your surgery went well, Rick! Prayers for a speedy recovery and that you continue to be in good health
I wish you all the very best! Keep rocking, stay strong. 🤘🏽
You look fantastic--only a week out! (Another cardiac anesthesiologist here...) So glad you're doing well--I look forward to regular uploads of new Rick videos!
God bless.
Whatever direction you choose to take your channel Rick I'll be here. I love the interviews, the theory and the breakdowns equally. Cut yourself some slack and don't push yourself too hard while you recover. I'll still be here, hopefully, I just turned 72 - Mark
After the surgery you can play the guitar? will that work for me? 😊
Rick, wow, you look great!!! Very happy to see you are on the mend! And so quickly too! Thank you for all you do. My family and I thoroughly enjoy your videos.
I am very glad you are much better now. Keep taking care of yourself
Glad your back.
So happy everything went well for you Rick.
Glad you're doing well. Curious if you considered having the surgery in Atlanta?
Glad you are doing well Rick...praying you continue to heal up! I may need this surgery...gonna go get my issue looked at again! Take care :)
So glad you're back and recuperating...take care 😊
Love the interviews! Need Paul McCartney
This video has given me so much happiness! You look great. God Bless.
Good job!
Praying Rick!
Speedy and full recovery, Rick!
Really glad you're feeling decent post-op!!! Can't ask for better than that.
Glad you are doing well.  Love your channel.  Follow doctors orders be well.
Glad to see you are in good shape Rick!
Good for you man, you look great! Happy you’re gonna be making more awesome videos. ✌️
Great News,Rick👍
Take Care of Yourself  Rick ......It's Only of You !!!
Live Long and Be Strong, Rick! You are a part of my watching regimen. I'm 63 and quit drinking 4 weeks ago due to chronic constipation. I've already lost 16 pounds and I feel ten years younger, in just a month. I hope to never drink again. I hope to keep watching your videos, we both need our health.
Praying for your continuing good health, sir!
God bless you Rick
So glad you're doing well, Rick. Keep on rockin' in the free world!
Variety is great, Rick. I enjoy all of your videos. You look good.
I'm 40 years old and they told me last year I had a prolapsed mitral valve and that it was benign. I hope it stays that way🤞 glad the surgery was a success!
Cheers, Rick!
God bless you!
Just happy you're back and still yourself. Getting old sucks.. I love the interviews, some big time guests!
I love the what makes this song great video. It has really helped me analyze other music to help me with my own
Hey, same surgeon too!
I'm glad you are feeling better! Here's to a speedy recovery. Keep rocking!
Glad you're doing well
Best of luck to you mate
Rick, please take care! I’m so glad you’re back and fine! Count on us! I’m sure your good heart is even more generous and kind. Tks!
I had mitral valve repair 10 years ago and feel great. Best of luck on your recovery.
Best of health to you, Rick!  Hope your recuperation is fast and pain free!
So glad you are on the mend......great news Rick.....
Mitral valve repair?  My wife had that done 24 years ago!!! PLEASE take this advise; treat any fever or infection SERIOUSLY! Don't be too paranoid about it, but my wife's repaired valve was destroyed after 10 years due to 3 infections she had in a row. Take an antibiotic right before ANY dental work, even cleaning. If your valve gets damaged, you will need a mechanical one, and you don't want to go through THAT again! Just some friendly advise from someone who enjoys your videos.
Good on you for getting fixed.  I had MY mitral valve fixed at Cleveland Clinic about 12 years ago and my sister just had hers fixed last year in NYC.  You're gonna feel the difference and it is truly a load off your mind.
Glad you got it taken care of.
So wonderful to hear you're doing well Rick!!!! Xxx
Keep playing bro 👍 I'm a multi instrumental player also and I broke my fucking neck. So I gotta wear this dog collar for another month.  Take care of yourself.  I enjoy your videos.  ✌️
Great to hear you are on the mend.  I had mine 16 years ago and going fine.  As you mentioned, noticeable energy shortly after the surgery.  How about commentary on Eyes of the World or Franklin's Tower by the GD.
that's just amazing, isn't it? Open heart surgery and a week later here you are! Glad you are doing well!
A speedy recovery, Rick! Many blessings!
Welcome  to the club
Warmest wishes for your recovery! You picked a great place to have your mitral surgery (said as a retired cardiologist). Now just one thing about those “Cleveland museums”…. Art? Rock and Roll? Hopefully both!!
I'm blown away, just hearing this; i'm glad you knew to be watching this, and that you got it addressed when the time was right.  these cardiologists are awesome.we love your channel.
So glad you are well
Glad you're doing well. As an old musician, I think your work is incredibly valuable. Come back at your own pace, bro. Don't push it. Peace
Happy to hear everything went well. Your videos are an oasis in the middle of this beautiful chaos we call living. Cent'Anni....
Glad you are taking good care of yourself, and that you are recovering well! Looking forward to many more years of insight into music from you.
I love pretty much anything you do on your channel, dude, so…. Just go with your instincts. So far, I’ve enjoyed it all.
So happy to hear your doing well, and look forward to a lifetime of what makes this song great.
We are all glad you are well mate. Here's to continued good health and success for you.
Glad you’re okay grandpa Rick! Would love to see you do more mixing and mastering classes.
I think I have a mitral valve prolapse like my mother had.  Might explain the complete lack of energy I have.
No lifting over 10 lbs…no Les Pauls for you :). Glad you are doing well.
Congratulations on a successful treatment.  I hope you have many more healthy years!  You went to the best place for heart issues!
Take good care of yourself Rick  I want to see you online for many years :) For Ideas, how about north of the boarder grunge era, The tea party song break down?   :)
Glad your surgery went well.  I had the same procedure done Oct 30 2023 (i'm 66) at Deborah Heart & Lung which is part of Cleveland Clinic and I agree 100% they are the best!
Interviews Interviews Interviews I worked in hospitals most of my life. Cardiology department. I have seen open hearts returning from surgery. Very dramatic. Lots of IV's lots of nurses, ventilators, but it is when you are on the other side when you lay there and weird thoughts go through your head that makes life amazing to you again. Never had surgery, but I was rushed to Loma Linda for a heart procedure. Crazy stuff. Get well soon.
That’s amazing that you have no pain and are back on camera in a week. Many people even younger than you require 3 months of rehab to get back to a semblance of physical normalcy. Of course, it will be 4-8 weeks before you can do push-ups and strenuous tasks, but you look amazingly good, congrats!
All the best Rick !!! Love your channel!
Great. Your stuff is important and entertaining. Thank you. All the best. Good life. Live long and continue great work.
Cleveland Rock!   Glad you’re back in the saddle and it was a successful operation.  👍👏👏❤
Rick, I recently discovered your channel and I immediately subscribed, I’m one of those who think like you do in many aspects of music and how it has negatively changed over the years (popular music). Sadly it makes me sort of an antagonist for most people haha, but them I watch your videos and I identify. Anyways, thank you for doing what you do, I admire you and hope you get better!
I'm very pleased your surgery went well Rick! Very well done!
Looking good Rick, I’m glad you’re back kicking ass.
Glad you're feeling better, Brother! 👍
Hey Rick. I had triple bypass in January. I’m 54 and feel great. Excercise regularly and I am back to the bench press and push ups. Walking is issue for me. Wishing you the best 👊🏾
Dear Rick, Congratulations. You will never know how much your channel, the teaching videos with whiteboard, and recent interviews have spring-boarded me toward a life-long passionate journey of learning piano and guitar, for deeper pursuit of a "me"-directed personal, emotive sound. I really appreciate the personal touch of sharing yourself and the stories of your dad, your brother, your college professor days, and studio/band beginnings. All of the  work you have put in to teaching and training, and inspiring us. Take care of yourself.  From another middle-aged teacher, Jonathan.
Very glad you are doing well Rick.
Rick, glad to hear you are doing so well! You make your event sound like a walk in the park. I'm 61 so... We all enjoy the gift of music which keeps our spirits forever young. I expect you'll be giving the stacks a run with a diet Les Paul, until the weight restriction is lifted. All the best!
Glad to hear you are doing well. Love your insights on music!
Welcome back Rick and i'm glad everything worked out for you. Looking forward to your channel for years to come.
Cleveland clinic isn't next door to Atlanta, but for sure, it's worth the trip.
Whoa you’re making videos already?  Easy does it man!
🙏🙏🙏
Seriously sorry to hear this . I had a heart attack and dual bypass. Then my employer fired me when I got cancer. At least you still have  income.
I'm 69 and was also diagnosed with a regurgitative valve. Apparently it's part of the aging process and I wasn't informed of any future surgeries or anything. I still race road bikes and sustain incredibly high heart rates, but my cardiologist says that's no problem. I've been getting super drowsy in the afternoons lately...and might want to get a second opinion🤔 Glad to hear you're back and healthy Rick...cause your channel(s) are the best on YT!!👍
10 lbs. Leave the Les Paul on the stand for a bit.  Glad to hear and see you're doing well.
Oh man! I’m so glad you’re doing well! Orthopedic Surgeon here, and amateur (at best) bassist. Please take good care of yourself, brother. You are indeed a treasure, my friend. All the best!!!
congrats:)
Great news, glad you're fixed and healing! Thank you for all you do!
Rick, you appear frail and  it looks like you have lost weight.  take care of yourself and god bless.
God bless, dude. You rock. Glad you're on the mend!
We love you Rick!
For those that are not curious, there's probably a different channel out there somewhere for you but it's not first rate like Rick's! For those that are curious - and concerned - this is AMAZING to hear you're doing so well! ❤🫀👏🙏
Be well!
God Bless you Rick and PLEASE PLEASE take care of yourself.
Glad to hear you’re doing well. Praying for a quick recovery.
You talk a lot about how mainstream music has gotten worse. I think one of the main reasons is that it takes effort to find music that you like so instead people just listen to what's good enough to them. To combat that try showing different niches/genres or artists that deserve more attention.
Glad to see you’re back at Rick!
Thank you for the update. Wishing you the best health. God Bless.
Great to hear!
Get well.   Musix education *and guitar playing) need you back at work.
Hey Rick! A hug for you.
Glad to hear your surgery was successful!
Thank you for Telling Us all of this! I Love you Rick! WooF!🐶🐶
Amazing the times we live in, that we could have open heart surgery and be doing pretty much a normal life a few days afterward.  Glad you solved this issue and that you're back in the game in NO time! Take care and keep the videos coming!
2 strokes ,endocarditis,3 aortic valve,changes over 2 open hearts,two ablation,s ,one sub deral,and one Deep legTromboses ,Still Rockin 68 on Saturday never felt better The Weatherman,Calabogie ,love your show ❤
Glad your good Rick, big fan of your stuff Jeff K. Northside Hospital.
Monitor yourself carefully. A good friend of mine had a similar issue with his heart. He knew about it from a young age. He's about 56 now. He knew it would be a problem that would need to be addressed as some point. Day after Christmas (this past Christmas), he ended up in the emergency room in a hospital in Boston. They did the procedure as an emergency procedure right then. It was a long procedure that involved cracking his chest open. He went home after about 3 weeks. About 4 weeks later when he went back for a post operation checkup, he told the doctor that he had been having occasional fevers since the operation. Doctor knew it was not normal. Turns out, he contracted an infection in his chest from the operation. Very dangerous. He ended up in a different hospital in Boston. (These were both large top hospitals in Boston). That hospital did not want to deal with it and told him the original hospital that did the operation should correct it. He went back to the hospital that did the operation. I don't know all of the details, except they had to open him up again. They had to induce a coma for a while (I'm not sure of all of the particulars). They had to redo the original operation and he was in the hospital for about another 6 weeks. He was out of work for about 5 months. Last time I saw him, he still had the tubes in him and was still injecting meds into himself on a daily basis. If he hadn't mentioned he was having occasional fevers to his doctor during his visit, it could have been even worst.
So glad that you are doing well!
So glad you're doing well!!
Rick  reminds me of Adam Savage from Mythbusters just his speech and mannerisms. So glad that he is feeling better!
Congratulations on a successful surgery brother! I'm glad you're feeling good!
Thank goodness & glad everything went well Rick ! ❤
I'm glad that you've recovered so well. Now you have more heart to devote to great music!
I'm so glad your ok, and can play the guitar
My mother had the same condition. She declined the surgery because she was afraid, but made it to 98 anyway. Best of health to you Rick.
Glad you’re doing well!
It's absolutely amazing to see how far medical treatments have progressed in my life time.   Glad to see you're up and around.
Heal yourself. Live Long and Prosper Rick ! You've got the music inside you and it's just gotta come out.
Congrats!  I had open heart in March.  I was in pain for weeks.  But you would’ve known this far out though.
Happy to hear all went well with your surgery. Here’s to a speedy recovery!
Great to see you recovering so well !  Looking forward to your future projects. Be safe, sir !
Best of health! You've done a great job keeping a fading art alive.
Hope you recover soon!! God bless!!
Awesome news Rick! You take it easy Sir!
Speedy recovery
Great news, Rick!
So thankful you’re ok! Watch your programs videos and interviews all the time. Awesome stuff. Take care and listen to your doctor!
I'm so glad to see that you pulled through, Rick! The world 🌎 needs YOU! 💪🎵❤️
Cardiologist loved his Harley Davidson bike. He was having some engine trouble so he took it to the shop. He was off that day so he hung around while the mechanic took the engine apart to fix it. The mechanic said, “Doc, we’re a lot alike. The heart is the engine of a person so we both work on engines.” The cardiologist nodded in agreement. The mechanic continued, “So if we both work on engines, why do you make so much more money than me?” The cardiologist thought for a second, then replied, “Try to fix it while the engine is still running.”
Just glad you’re alright and are doing great!
Glad to see you're doing well Rick take care of yourself
I’m so happy to hear that your surgery was successful and you are feeling good.
very best of luck.  Had mitral and tricuspid valve rebuild 4 years ago (at 69). Everything you do here is amazing and advances our musical progress and learning in general.  The wide spectrum of how you accomplish your mission is all great.  Hard to beat your well-balanced top quality lessons in theory,  entertainment (interviews, performances, countdowns and best ofs), and musicianship lessons.
So glad to hear it was successful.   Great move going to Cleveland!!  Best wishes for many years ahead of great health.
So very glad all is well!  Love the channel!  All the best!
Glad you are better than before and continuing to improve.
Glad you're doing well and that all was successful. Take care!!
glad you're doing well, Rick!
My god.....I couldn't walk 9 miles when I was 18 and healthy.....good grief.
Stay well, Rick
Lots of health, music and fun making content ahead to you!
Heal up, mate. God bless.
Glad to see you well and recovering.
Rick--You don't need our help. Your talent and instincts are just perfect. You're a great friend who I've never met.
Rick, I’m glad you’re doing well.
Glad to hear you are doing well. Rock on!
Glad you are ok Buddy! Stay strong and healthy!
Get well... better, Rick!
👍
Rick, what is your health insurance company?
The heavy stuff, sir. Congrats on a successful preemptive interception!  🙏🏼
Hang in there dude !   🙂
Good for you Rick! I’m in a similar situation, I’m 72 and still in a holding pattern…
Modern medicine is amazing.  Glad it worked for you!
You are so many amazing, wonderful, and positive things Rick. Too many to mention. You’ve taught us so much more than modes, chords, and class. Lots of love from Vancouver BC.  John 🤘🏻😝🇨🇦
Love you buddy. Do what needed to keep going!
Glad to see that you’re better.
Your gonna start a heart surgery channel now? 😅😅😅 Blessings and keep getting well!!!
Glad you're well!
When I had my chest cracked open, it was during an A-Clip procedure (I had a stroke in 2019 and the Watchman wouldn't fit) that went sideways because I started bleeding out. What gave me the most pain was where my ribs were broken in the back because they had to go in rather quickly, no time for gentleness. Love your videos , although I don't think at my age I'll ever be able to learn guitar, my grandson is picking it up rather quickly. ❤ Godspeed !
Glad your op went well , i had open heart surgery last year .  i had the same thought as you did , that is the first  time my heart had stopped .
Glad you are on the mend! I have been loving the interviews... especially some of the artists I was not necessarily familiar with. I would love to see more of What Makes This Song Great. Those are always fun!   Stay healthy!
Congrats on the successful surgery, here's hoping for a speedy recovery!
I had open heart surgery in 2019 and feel so much better.  The only issue I have had since is, I struggle with dexterity in my chord hand.  I keep plugging away though.  I love your channel Rick!!  You are an inspiration and a great teacher!!!
Santé Rick!!!
I'm happy you have kept up on your health and doing well :)
Happy to hear it all went well Rick! My dad had major abdominal surgery last Monday also… glad to see you well ❤
congrats and yay!
Much love Rick to you and your team! Do you have any supplement or health tips you can pass on?
Wish you well, Rick.
I had mitral valve surgery around 12 years ago. Like you, I was aware of the regurgitation for years and had to wait until it got bad enough to require surgery. I've been doing well since then. Wishing you the best!
God Bless
All the best Rick!
VERY happy you're patched up good! PLEASE do a deep dive on Buckethead at some point? There's quite simply nobody like him on Earth, before or since. Try out Too Many Humans or some PRAXIS too! 🔥
Get better soon Rick beato
Thank you for sharing your personal life here with us.  Wishing you continued health and music is the key
Great to see you back in the studio so soon after your surgery. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.
Thank God.  Amazing... Wish you the best!
More cowbell!
Rest up, and hoping your recovery keeps going as well has it has!
It is awesome to see you up and about (such a relief!!!) Don’t scare us this way!!!
Great news! We love ya man!
Love your videos! So glad all went well and you are feeling great!!
I had triple bypass surgery a few months ago and my sternum had to get cracked open as well.  It was a big shocker because I'm 49 and "healthy."  Took me longer to recover, but playing guitar was all I could do.  But it kept my mind off my pain.  Get better soon!
OMG glad you're OK!
Glad you are OK now Rick!!!
Oh yeah, coughing. Forgot how much that used to hurt. Well it goes away to the point you forget it was an issue.
Rick, I had open heart surgery here in the Philly suburbs in Nov. 2019. Quadruple bypass... they almost had to replace my mitral valve, but wound up not having to. It stopped leaking after the bypasses. I know exactly what you're going through right now.  Be well and take care! Looking forward to many more videos!
We love you Rick! Hoping for a speedy recovery!
Great news, Rick.  All the best in the future.
Enjoying the long form interviews
glad to hear you're on the mend brother ❤
Glad to hear that you're doing alright after major surgery. I've been watching your channel for about four years now and consider it the best music channel there is in a very crowded market. Long may you and your channel keep thieving.
I'm ecstatic that you are doing well! Sending best wishes for a speedy and complete recovery!
Stay tough buddy!!
Great news! Heal up quickly!  ❤
Great, Rick. Thank God you came through like a champ. I have several friends who went in but didn't make it out. Keep working, keep moving and start doing everything you have wanted to do with your loved ones but didn't have the time.
Very glad my favorite YouTuber is doing fine 👍
I 'm glad you are doing well! My becoming a heart patient in January, brought me to your channel as well as the "bundle", (worth it!). I approached the guitar after my events as a way get my dexterity back, and remind myself that I am still here, and there is still a spark. Glad you are doing well.
Great see you YouTubing   again !
I'm glad the procedure was a success and you're feeling better!
Glad it all went well, Rick - you give another old geezer (I'm 63) confidence.  Stay well, and keep on rockin'!
Hey Rick... glad to hear the operation went well... really enjoy your videos! A suggestion.... maybe you've heard of Amy at Virgin Rock (youtube)... she has interesting insights into rock songs/music... might be an interesting collaboration opportunity for you both on some songs?
That's outstanding news Rick and I hope you make a speedy & full recovery. Rock on sir...
Thank God you're okay Rick! Best wishes from your fans in RI!
So glad to see you on the mend Rick. May God Bless Sir.
Oh P. S. I still suck at guitar. Yeah yeah yeah I don't practice like I should.
Glad all is well!
Rick, been there done that I've got a scar from my chest to my belly button. And at the time I didn't really think about it because the doctor I had was the best in the country. The four days later I truly thought I was going to die. So I'm so happy for you. I'm very happy everything went great Good luck in the future.
Rick, really glad your doing well… I know for a lot of us your content is part of our lives… all of it… its been extremely educational and the stories quite inspiring. I hope this doesn’t come off sounding crazy, but have you ever thought about including a critique session on some of your listeners songs/ musical ideas. I don’t, I imagine the majority of your listeners are aspiring artist like myself. Just a thought. Get better soon young man, lots of prayers for you brother… Lon<3
Glad you are doing well
Super glad you’re OK and everything went well. I think now is a good time to interview Ann and Nancy Wilson. Don’t ya think?
Wow Rick. So happy you are ok. Love your channel
Godspeed Brother… I teach and perform Trauma Ultrasound at Mass General Brigham in Boston- you are a blessed man with the diagnosis and treatment at the Cleveland Clinic ✅
During my defib, they played music in the operating room.  I said don't play "Shock The Monkey."  Take your pills and do what they tell ya.  You'll be fine. ❤
So glad you're doing well. Your voice, truth, and wisdom is truly important amongst the multitude of channels out there.
Hello Rick; I love your channels, both of them. I so glad you are healthy and ready to continue to share with all of us your great knowledge of everything music.
You’re not a bird. Don’t regurgitate. 😉
Best always to you Rick. Wishing you a speedy recovery. You are a very special guy. Regards.
Great, Rick, to have You back and good! God bless You!
These things happen, I'm getting cancer treatments.
Praise God    Continued prayers for your better health 🙏
God bless from Australia
God bless. Have a full and speedy recovery. I lost my mother for the same mitral valve issue. I too have some regurgitation but not at the surgical level yet. Stay strong and heal well buddy. And when you're ready, I'm happy to bring my music over personally :-)
Glad to see you are doing well.
Thankful all went well!
I hope you're feeling better Rick, get well! 👍
We Clevelanders sometimes take our awesome medical clinics here for granted. Glad they got you taken care of!
Heart patient also. Cheers my man. Think bout best Motown. My time frame. Philly
Glad your ok! Here's to another 62 yrs 🍻
I love your videos recommending underrated songs from various bands and why they are good songs. You continue to widen my already wide musical taste so thank you for that.
Good to see you so well after that surgery. Now you must write a song about this!
I'm so happy to know you are okay. Been following you for a few years, love your content!
❤️
Blessings to ya bro from another 1962 model!  Glad you are doing so well and thank you for your channel!
Todd Rundgren plays ATL Oct 1.  Might be a good time to interview him.
Keep following up with your doctor!  I know that you’re fresh out of the factory, but I just lost my 43-year old husband to congenital atrial fibrillation. He died in his sleep four months ago. Stay the course and get well soon ❤
Rick,  You are an excellent role model for a lot of men out there who don’t want to go to see the doc! Good on you for being proactive and taking care of yourself…being an older dad and all. Wishing you a speedy recovery ☮️
Rick,hope and pray you are well,im 65 years old and absolutely love your channel and your breakdown on so many songs and bands i grew up with.
Glad your Good ❤
Bravo to you Rick! Great update on your surgery.
Great to have you still with us. Prayers to you and your family
Aw man! Glad the procedure was successful!
Good luck Rick!
Modern medicine is a fuckin' miracle.
Continued healing! Thank you for making my life more enjoyable.
Lookin g good Rick. 30 year cardio/ thoracic nurse, here, you had excellent care, bro. GOD bless you!
How about a Kick Start My Heart tutorial ! LOL glad you're ok.
We’re all so glad and thankful that it went well.  God Bless…
Glad you are doing well.
This guy has no idea how great he is. Glad you're doing well, Rick!
Glad you are doing well!   All the Best to you!   Love your take on the state of music these days!!!
It’s good to know you’re okay. God bless!🙏🏼
🤘
First things first:  Glad you're ok.  It goes without saying that music and all of it's surroundings in 2024 is unrecognizable from even 10 years ago, so the importance of your voice helping others learn about music, real musicians, and 'how the sausage gets made' is so vitally important that I lack the vocabulary to express it.  We decorate our dreams with imagination. We decorate our surroundings with color, texture, and dimension. But we decorate our *time* with music.  A world where fewer people really understand what that means and functions is....  Well, terrifying.  Whether you know it (or frame it this way) or not, you're a very visible element fighting the good fight, and we're grateful.  That said, you asked a question:  our thoughts on the future of your channel(s).  In no particular order...  1  Please keep the interviews coming.  We're losing our heroes at an alarming rate, and you're getting a side of them they haven't often shown.  I just saw yesterday where Jimmy Herring has cancer...  I still think of him and Otiel from ARU days as just a little older than me.  (Then again, I'm not as young as my brain thinks I am.) 2. Even if only occasionally, more 'What makes this song great' fuels the fire, and helps peel the layers back on some brilliant work.  I can only imagine how hard it is to get access to the tracks, but pulling in the unusual and unexpected just sets you that much further apart. 3.  Keep the theory coming.  Brilliant stuff. 4.  Music history - a band, a particular musician, an album...  A deep dive on any of them is great.  Finally, thank you very much for all you do.  I hope you enjoy doing it as much as we enjoy learning from you.
Speedy recovery.
Best wishes for the future Sir...
Thank God all went well, Rick ! Glad you're back in one piece ! Keep doing those great videos
Glad it went well. I have been dealing with AFIB for several years finally had an ablation in December. It’s worth getting it fixed!!
Stayin' alive... Stayin' alive....🎹🎸🎵🎶🥁
Wishing you a speedy recovery and the best of health going forward. Your life is more important than any channel, so there's no shame in slowing down for a bit.
Best wishes Rick ❤
We are happy for you. Best wishes!
Godspeed  brother
Love the channel.  Glad you are well!
Hello Sir Rick! I'm Brazilian and I discovered your channel through the beautiful interview with Robert DeLeo. I wish all the best for you! God bless you🙏
Happy your surgery went well and your healing quickly. All of your content is interesting, so I personally don't have any gripes about any of your content. I say just keep doing whatever makes you happy and excited to make whatever your next video might be.
Glad to see you're ok, Bless you always
All the best with your recovery. Anaesthesia is quite hard on the nervous system so be kind to yourself for the next little while. It too will pass.
Dear Rick, you have a great mindset! I've had two open heart surgeries. The first was in 1997 when I was 36 -- a complex aortic valve repair. The second one was in Dec 2020, right at the height of Covid, but necessary because the valve stenosis was critical. Since then I've had a bovine aortic valve and a Dacron aorta! You amaze me with your quick bounce back! I'm 63 now and it took me a while to come out of the woods the second time 😊
Happy to hear good news from you! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
So glad you’re doing well! Appreciate your authenticity. Thank you for letting us know you & your life. Btw you look fantastic, and I’ve always noted your high energy and youthful personality. I thought you were around 40 - I’m silver too, been greying since 16. I’m a new subscriber, so I’m still figuring out what I like best about your content, but I’ll keep you updated on what content I am most enjoying.
Rick on 🧑‍🎤
LONG LIFE TO YOU RICK!!!!
Glad you are doing so well after surgery Rick! Thank you for all the content you provide on your channel.
Stay well, Rick, GBY. Greetings from São Paulo, Brazil.
Prayers for you and your family!!!🙏🙏💯💯
Organ recital!  Glad you are doing well.
Love your positivity Rick, thank you.
Godspeed Rick
A massive THANK YOU to the Clevelandd Clinic and all the Dr's, nurses and other care providers and staff who took such great care of Rick and returned him to us safe and sound! Glad to hear you're feeling  better,  Rick!! Please take good care of yourself and know you are loved by many.
These are the days of miracles and wonder.  Cheers Rick
I can’t wait for @nbc to give @rickbeato his own shoe
rick, i’m 41 and had aortic valve repair and CABG in January. Good to see you in the other side of this!
Heal up, brah!
I'm 12 weeks out from mitral valve repair.  I didn't have quite as fast a recovery as you but I've been out hiking waterfalls the last month.  Take it easy and pay attention to those sternal precautions.
62 years plus 9months. The heart of a baby in the womb begins not long after conception. Think also where you will spend eternity. Eventually all our hearts stop beating. Consider Christ who took the penalty of those He came to save so that they will have eternal life with Him in heaven.
“But I expect the real changes to start When I finally get my Cleveland Heart They're made to take a bashing And never lose their passion” Jackson Browne
Hey Rick,  My son and I will watch your channel occasionally and we both are glad that you had an amazing surgeon.
Hello Rick: Yeah, my father had Mitro valve (?) prolapse for years and had surgery about 22 years ago. He's 81 and still going strong so you have nothing to worry about. I'm a drummer to the core but i have learned so much more from you: Basically "everything music" -  Every time you break down a song, I have to listen to it because you bring so much more life to it.  Love your channel. God bless!
Looks like you’ve made a good recovery and best of luck from Joe in Toronto. Next time you’re in Cleveland be sure to visit the R&R Hall of Fame.
Glad you’re doing well. I’ll stay tuned.
This is amazing that you just had this done and the outcome was good!   My brother, who is an accomplished jazz drummer, had the same surgery about 14 months ago also with a good outcome.  Unlike Rick though, it was completely unexpected.  And his recovery was slow.   He’s doing well now thankfully!
Glad you’re back Rick! We’re happy you are healthy. You have great accessible channel. Sending good vibes your way.
My aunt is about to have an open heart surgery and this put my mind at ease.
Get well. Best Regards.
My best wishes for you, Rick. Greetings from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Rick! Bless you man. So glad to hear your report on your status health wise. I would love a Robert Smith, Simon Gallup and company Cure interview on their song creations. As a HUM fan, I would enjoy an in depth review with them as well (RIP Bryan St Pere). Sometimes you do your scales/quick lesson on instagram and I dig those.  KEVIN SHIELDS and company! Get those guys to talk to you.
Glad you're okay Rick! I too have a leaky mitral valve but my regurgitation is minimal. However I'm currently watching this from my hospital bed as I recover from an ablation procedure to correct my heart rhythm. And I'm only 37 😂. Looking forward to getting back to playing guitar again. Not supposed to lift over 10lbs either.... Maybe I'll play the SG instead of the Les Paul for a couple weeks 😂
Love ya brother!!!!
You can only pick up 10 pounds? When you want to play a Les Paul you'll have to get the wife or kids to get it for you!
You look great for just having your chest opened up. God speed and best wishes.
Glad to hear your recovering, Rick! Gotta keep our health in top shape! As for future videos, I loved your "What makes this song great" segments. The breakdown really revealed the artist's intentions and some of those isolated sections are beautiful in their own right. I'd love to see some more. 🙂
Glad to hear the great news.  Happy to know your spirits are high with no complications.
I'm so glad you had your surgery and you are feeling better! I appreciate everything you do on your channel and I sure would love some more videos about breaking down songs. I really enjoy those :)
I'm so grateful everything went so well. And especially glad we'll be seeing much more of you on the channel.
Wonderful to see you sharing your recovery. Stay well!
Glad to hear you're doing well! I'll be praying for continued health
I had heart surgery when I was 62--about 5 years ago, and been much better since. So glad you are okay! Amazing what they can do these days.
God Bless you Rick…love you for you… keep on keeping on❤
Prayers for continued healing, Rick. You look fantastic. You got this! ♥
Great to see you back and doing so well. Thank you for sharing your health experience. So many men soldier on, ignoring symptoms that suggest a trip to the doctor is required. Hopefully, you will inspire people to go and get a check-up. Keep feeling better Rick!
Continued good health to you. Sir!!
glad you are ok
Glad you're doing well after surgeryy I know a man who had bypass surgery at age 70, his doctor gave him a 70 year warranty on his heart!
Glad you're recovering well. No lifting more than 10 lbs so no Les Pauls for a few weeks!
Be well and take care, amigo!
Did your cardiologist use any AI to determine anything?
Saw you IG post, Rick... this video update made my day! Rock on brotha'!
Rick, very happy to see you back on your feet brother! Looking forward to seeing more of your amazing videos! Take it easy, we need you to help us with our musical journey! :)
I had a aortic valve replacement recently, same thing, open heart surgery, we should be so thankful, 30 or 40 years ago we would've suffered a slow agonising death. I look upon every day as a bonus ! Keep Rockin Rick.... fan from Aussie.
Best wishes for a speedy recovery!😍
Rick Please review and talk about modern game music!
Glad you are OK, Rick!  Look forward to continuing to dial in. As a retired teacher, I recognize a great educator. Love working   scales and the  arpeggio modules.
Rick I was at my cardiologist last week and then was sent to a well known hospital in Syracuse NY for a TEE.   Glad you are doing well.
Get well soon! We'll call this episode: What makes this heart beat great.
So glad your surgery went well.
I am glad you feel good because you look still like you just cheated dead brother. God bless you and keep you for your family and all of us.
Rick, so glad you're doing well. Take care of yourself and keep making your great videos!
I’m glad you’re feeling better.  Did you have any dreams during or after the surgery that were unique and or surreal? 3:26
Glad it was a success!
Glad you're well..
Our prayers for your speedy recovery.  Love watching all the pod casts.  love all the music theory.  love the breakdown of songs and lots of Steely Dan.  Take care and can't wait for the next year of pod casts.  Roger Van Gorden
Just like Joe Biden.😢
Glad to see you back! Take care of yourself and heal completely. Oh, and please get  someone ELSE to get the guitars down feom the wall
Glad you came through that so well, Rick! Godspeed, my friend!
Hope you get well soon 🙏
this is good news. Glad that you are making a strong recovery.
Rick: Praying for your healing and return of strength. It would be fascinating to see you sit down with Robert Fripp. Pax, Fr. Tommy Allen (priest)
Doctor: Well Rick, it was touch and go,but with time and plenty of rest eg no lifting anything say over 10bs.... Rick [interrupting,anxiously] Doc, will i be ok to lift and play my guitars? Doc: [laughs] yes Rick,of course😂 Rick; Phew!
Glad you are doing well Rick!  Thank goodness for modern medicine and skilled medical staff!
Great to see you up and about much love❤
Well, you can play guitar but you can’t play any Les Pauls :)
No heavy Lesters for a while!
Hey Rick, lm glad to hear that the procedure was incredibly successful!  Take it easy for a little while and heal-up good!
Happy to hear you are doing well and the surgery was a success! I'd love to see you go back to some song breakdowns in the future. After you recover, of course! Stay well!
Great to see you back Rick. Best wishes. ✨
Welcome to the "If it weren't for modern technology I'd be dead" club. 😁 Glad you're doing well!
So glad you’re still with us Rick ….. they had to stop & restart my heart 3 time while I was awake..lol it took 1 person  to inject the heart stopper..another team to restart 3x  while I laid their …. So you my live a lot longer a lot longer ❤
I’m pushing 61 and have followed your channel for many years. I always knew we had to be close in age based on your music taste. Glad the surgery was successful, looking forward to watching many more videos.
God Bless! Keep taking care of yourself Rick! Get everything check yearly! Too many good people leaving too soon.
Glad your ok
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is awesome isn’t it!
Glad to see and hear you doing so well. Modern medicine's pretty amazing, isn't it?
Glad youre well !
Glad you're doing so well  Rick ,yes we all do love because you're so real and honest to say the least , hope you come to Rhode Island someday!
Get plenty of rest!  So glad you're doing better.
I had my bicuspid aortic valve replaced with a prosthetic valve back when I was 23 (I'm 48 now). I was out jogging 4 days after the surgery (doubt I'd be doing that if I had the surgery at my age now.) The worst parts for me were learning how to sleep on my back and how to get out of bed without using my arms.
Rick! I'm happy to hear that all went well. I underwent double-bypass surgery this past Dec.5th. I am also doing great. Have been working hard on my therapies. Have been able to play a handful of gigs this summer, people tell me I look like I had no heart issues. Best wishes on your full recovery! May you have many more years left to rock and talk about all things music. Be Well!
Happy to know the procedure went so well!
Much love
Congratulations on your speedy recovery Rick!  I had the same surgery in 2016 and recovered well, but not as quickly as you apparently have.  Don’t push things too much as you start to feel better, because you will definitely have more energy.
welcome to the zipper club
Great to see you back and looking well.
Interview Bob Dylan
Great you are doing well, Rick!  Take care!
really appreciate you sir...Jesus knows everything that we do not...
You are a lucky boy, Rick. Here’s some advice from a cancer and heart failure survivor: take a few moments to reframe your life as well. Look back and be grateful for where you have been and thankful for each new sunrise you now get to see. It’s all magic.  Take care, my friend. 😋
Great to see you're back, Rick!
glad you're ok Rick, just glad it wasn't a bit b/c of all the recent "response" videos...🤘😎
I have the same Mitral regurgitation problem.  Will have a surgery « someday » .  You are an inspiration.  Bravo.
Rick, I am happy all is well, I am faced with open heart surgery for HCM and you have put my mind at ease. Love your videos, I'm 53 and my name is Neil Young. My uncle named me back in 71....been hearing all sorts of comments about my name as far as I can remember
I'm glad you're feeling better Rick  looking forward to seeing more videos. With the sorry state of music today we need someone like you to remind us what GOOD MUSIC should sound like a big THANK YOU!!!! from all of us to you.
now you're better than you were for many years 👍
Modern medicine is incredible and I'm so glad you came out feeling healthy already! My mom had open heart surgery back in '82 to put a patch over a silver dollar sized hole in her heart some by Denton Cooley and was in recovery for like a month!
The "key formulas of sound" is what I'm interested to learn more about
Wishing you a good recovery and many more informative Videeos!
Avoid 70's Les Pauls with the lift restriction.
Sending positive energy to you, brother... along with much love and respect.  Stay strong🤘🏼
Nice to hear you're great! Hope you keep making amazing music videos! :)
I've been to the CC myself as I'm being watched for an ascending aneurysm and I wouldn't have anyone else due the surgery over the CC. Get well soon.
🙏🏼❤🎸
Glad to hear you're doing well. Maybe this would be the perfect time to try arrange an interview with Ann and Nancy Wilson? Wishing you well for a full recovery.
Rick, glad you’re doing well. Good blood flow in heart is truly life changing. Not my business, but was it a repair or replacement? My mother in law had the mechanical valve replacement; in a very quiet room you could hear the click. Modern medicine is certainly amazing. Get your rest.
Glad the surgery was a success!
You may not be in their MVP club, but you are still a MVP to us!!
I know it's extra cheesy and dad joke- ish , but I hope you continue to follow your heart ! It has served you and us all well ! ❤️
Godspeed on your healing Rick, you look great! I love the interviews, I don't watch all of them as soon as I see them, but I watch them. They are a fascinating look behind the making of some of the greatest music of all time. However, I love having you point out things in a song that I might never have heard. I love watching your excitement in those moments when something special is coming or has just played. No matter the genre, no matter the time frame, those moments have reshaped my appreciation of the music I've enjoyed all my life and I want more of it, it never gets old or stale because YOU love the music just like we do.
GOOD TO HEAR THIS NEWS... Without our health we have nothing...  Thank you Rick for sharing so much...
Hey Sir, we need your wisdom expanding for a few more years, hoping this new heartbeat reset puts you on the road again with more energy and passion for your job and for joining life, which is wonderful. Don't lift up those huge amps and enjoy your recovery. With appreciation for this update... cheers!
So glad and grateful that you are well.
If you can't lift over ten pounds, how are you going to go to the bathroom?
I'm 55 and had double bypass about a year ago, so I have the same giant scar down the middle of my chest to remind me to make the most of the day, as this could all go away in a blink.  I enjoy your channel and was thinking maybe some breakdowns of covers that are vastly different than the originals?  Just an idea. Glad you are feeling well, oh and by the way, the wierd "numbness" of the skin on your chest, I'm still waiting to get all the feeling back.
Glad you had a great outcome.....
Feel better buddy.
glad you are ok Rick. whatever you put i will watch. dont worry about that
wishing you a healthy recovery..... The Cleveland Clinic is a great hospital..... my cousin was there for a stroke recovery
Glad you made it through, Rick.  You are a very good educator. Theory is abstract and tough for many of us.  You have a special ability to explain.  Very glad you will continue to be with us!
Rick, i need you for at least 100 more years! Not too much to ask! Thank you for your love of music, i wish you well 🤗
Count your blessings.  When I was 19, I was told I'd need major surgery in 7 to 10 years.  It ended up happening when I was 22.
Take it easy for a while, I work in ICU post heart surgery and protect your sternum.
So glad you are OK.  I had a widow maker heart attack 2 years ago.  Hint:  It's never a good thing when your heart is 100 percent clogged. 😂 I'm in the top 12% of my "class" since I survived.  Scary stuff.
Great to see you’re doing well. I’d love to see videos on you working on a song as a producer, what you’re thinking and saying to musos in the process making a song better. Like you did as a job for years.
Glad to see you on the road to recovery.
So happy you're okay and up and around. Keep it up!
God bless you. He is watching over you. Be safe. Jesus Loves you
You look and sound great! Looking forward to seeing more videos!
Glad your feeling better Rick. I have a similar heart condition. So it's great to see you up and about!
All the best for a full recovery.
Best wishes Rick !! What about getting Warren Demartini on the show. Probably won't be easy...Who knows?!
Saul Goodman !
I'm glad you're doing well, brother. Thank you for your good content.
So glad you're doing well, Rick.  You look great man!  Keep on doing what you do... at your pace.  Take care.  Godspeed.
You're an inspiration, Rick.
Glad you are recovering well!
So glad you're doing well! BUT...10 pound max?? DO NOT TOUCH A LES PAUL!!! Lol
Surgeon says, "We're stopping your heart.  Ok, _now_ we're opening up your sternum.  Heart/lung bypass machine working.  Repairing funky mitral valve.  Re-starting your heart and disconnecting the heart/lung machine... _Like that._ "
Glad you are doing well. Love your videos!
Good to see you're doing well Rick. All the best.
Take care of yourself! We are inspired by you
I’m glad you’re ok Rick. Keep going !!
Super glad to hear about your health update Rick. Glad to know you're on the mend so quickly. One thing I miss is your "what makes this song great" features. Not sure what's left to cover but I feel like there are more songs out there to analyze and my God you are so good at it. It's what got me into your channel way way back when. Have LOVED your pivot to interviewing all of the wonderful folks you've talked with and that never gets old to me. One additional idea is the idea of a "round table" or "symposium" and I think the topic I'd love to see in that format is the state of the music business. As someone that worked at Sony Music in the late 80's and most of the 90's I share many of your positions on the shift from the product based model to the digital mode. Especially how much the art of A&R (there were good people doing it years ago) has died an ugly predictable death (we went from labels investing in artists' careers to mining The Voice for "hits".) Would be so cool to see some record company folks speak about this with some musicians at the dais as well. There's so many tires to kick there and would leave it to you to create the topical menu on that. I feel like you have covered this subject as have many of your guests but I can't recall anyone from the business side stepping up to speak their perspective. On a final note please think about interviewing KingsX. PLEASE!!! Would love to hear you engage them musically and regarding their thoughts on the business of music. Thoughts?
People don't even Google "health care" anymore
Be safe Rick
Stay well!
Rock on Rick! So glad to hear you're on the mend.
Glad you are doing well.
very glad to hear your surgery was a success & that you're back in front of the camera again! In Jesus' name, i pray for your continued good health, time with family & many more videos! :)
Happy to hear it was a success! Look forward to following your progress.. As far as direction of the channel.....It's not broken... don't fix it...
Glad to hear you're doing better Rick. Health comes before work.
Wow! That's great to hear that everything went so smoothly. God bless and keep bringing us the music. I love what you do.
Glad to hear your procedure was a success!  I worked for the Cleveland Clinic for about a dozen years. (I made a career switch 3 years back and left the organization.)  I was data/financial analyst ... but we talked a lot with the docs, and we were constantly amazed at what they can do.  No better place in the world you could have gone to.  Rest up!
Glad you’re feeling better!
God bless you, Rick.
Our stories are similar, Rick. I was diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation and prolapse in 2002, requiring valve repair surgery in 2005. I was 51 and had the procedure at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. Recovery was quick and I will be 70 in October. Talent-wise, I can't hold a candle to you. And I'm sorry you had to endure this. But...I confess that I'm comforted by the fact that we're connected in this very special way.  Recover well.
Have a great recovery Mr Rick Beato. Best regards from Chile.
I have the same thing in my Aortic valve. Going for Ross procedure surgery next month! Hope I look as good as you when I'm done!
Great to hear!
I've been battling/living w a rare Leukemia for the last 4 years. I know what you mean by "knowing it". I had many symptoms, but they all seemed to independent of one another. It wasn't until I started having vision problems that my eye doctor suggested I might have cancer. And he turned out to be right.
I can't even... 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Glad you're doing well!
Continued recovery, Rick. Bless you!
So happy you’re doing well. 👏👏👏
glad you're ok! keep on rockin' in the world sir!
Glad you are doing better.
Rick, I am also 62. Had to have a stent put in my heart last year. Well, what the hell, we are in "old rocker" mode now! Good luck to you.
🙏🙏🙏
Glad to see you back Rick!
You look awesome Rick! Glad everything is on the positive! ❤
Glad you are doing great Rick!!
Wishing you a fast recovery! Currently heart surgery is safe. I can see that you are doing pretty well.  I’m a heart surgeon  myself and amateur guitar player (just for fun). I’ve been following your channel 4-5 years ago.
Hope you're feeling better soon Rick. We need your expertise to separate the real music from the crap.
I'm glad your feeling better Rick. Love your channel you are awesome.
❤🎶❤️🎶❤️🎶❤️🎶❤️🎶❤️🎶❤️🎶❤️🎶You’re back in action and looking great! Looking forward to amazing new content! Relax, rest and recover! 🎸
GOD BLESS RICK and glad you're OK......... ROCK ON........!!!!!!!!!!!
👍
I hope you have a nice recovery, Rick.
I love whatever direction you choose to take it! The interviews are so good. I remember as a kid waiting for any of my heroes to do an interview on a news magazine, MTV, or late night television , etc. but they were never long enough. Your channel allows us to get to know these artists and provide us with a little glimpse into their lives, and especially, their inspirations, recording techniques, etc. Enjoy your work so much and very grateful you are doing well. Thanks for the update and take care!
Rick, so glad that your procedure was successful and that your full recovery seems all but guaranteed.
Geez Rick, sorry to hear that but I’m glad that you are feeling well and in good spirits.
Feel better soon, Rick!
Get Well soon, Rick !
Rick feel better and god bless
I am not sure I've ever seen someone who is so universally loved as you.  Well deserved I might add.  So glad you got tuned up!! We need you around!!  You look great!
Great that you have kept up with your issue, then, most importantly, you took care of it when you needed to.  To your health!
Unbelievable that you are up and about and look so good!!  In the past, I worked in open heart surgery--it's a real workout--you're doing so well!! Best wishes for your continued good health.
Glad you are doing well!  Keep rockin'!
So glad surgery went well! I had a coworker eith the same issue, and I remember the last day he came in to work before his surgery that he couldn't catch his breath. It was scary, but fortunately his surgery went well and he fully recovered. Hope your health continues to improve!
Hi Rick very happy all went well!
As a CCF patient (3xCABG-2012) I can share some things with you.  About 2 weeks after surgery I had my first big sneeze. HOLY SHIZ!!! I thought my ribcage had launched into Lake Erie! I was soon laughing about it, but it was unexpected and sharp. It gets less sensitive as time goes.  The biggest thing that they don't tell you is that "It's ALL About the Breathing." The extent of your recovery from surgery is linked to how well you relearn to breathe and how much you strengthen your breathing. That means... the dreaded... Cardio Exercise. I don't know how you take care of yourself... whether you exercise or run or bike.. But... Pick Something! Something that you can stand to do that is cardio. Preferably, sustained cardio (at least for several 5 minute spurts over 30 to 60 minutes. Something that makes your heart beat fast and hard.   Well... Let me stop there and say, "Only with your Doctors' Approval." My guess is... within the next 45 days.  I biked for a while and really enjoyed it, but... good old running (I used to hate running) is the most direct way. I enjoy my runs but the best thing about running is how good it feels when you stop. LOL  The cardiologists and surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic (CCF) are actual Rockstars. Yes. I meant to say it. They're not necessarily the guys or ladies that you would want to hang out with, but they are Real Fucking Scientists who have beat out top Med School Grads from the entire planet. If you ask a question, you better be prepared to comprehend the answer.  Rick... I wept 3x during the entire experience.  1. When I had my initial heart attack. All I could think of was my daughter who I was the main parent to. I told the Life Flight Sky EMT "I can't die! I have a 10 year old daughter."   2. I had to wait 3 months between my heart attack and 3xCABG for a whole bunch of genetic studies. Every male in my family have had an MI or died of one young. I had 3 months of pre-surgery meetings and  tests. The sugeon himself was a very blunt man.... LOL. He didn't sugar coat NUTHIN'!  I hadn't realized that there was a video tape (like a Flouroscope) of the catherization that initially saved my life. I just burst into tears uncontrollably at the moment that the blockage was opened and the damage to my heart stopped.  3. Was another meeting pre surgery when he described how they stop anf restart the heart. It had only just dawned on me that you can't sew up a beating heart.  I was the youngest patient in the cardiac recovery ward (46). A fact that I was NOT proud of. I had worked as an overnight recording engineer in Detroit and I used to smoke tons of cigs and eat shitty and overwork myself. There was a string genetic component to my cardiac issues, but my behaviour poured gasoline on it.  I am no longer in the business for other reasons, but I dabble and it is not the music that was harmful. It was cigs, shitty food, and staying up for 32 hours.  That was 12 years ago.  Anyhow.... Everybody is different, so what I described for me may not be your experience.  I gotta go. My daughter (all grown now) has my Cleveland Clinic Heart Pillow.  We Love You!  Take Care of yourself! Medications take some time  and some experimenting to calibrate.  I can tell you more later. Gotta go for now.
Glad you're recovering well!
Joining the expanding group of well-wishers, a cardiac patient too (triple bypass in 2017). Your recovery from the surgery is very impressive but the walking is probably the main factor.  I also do lots of walking, I walked the Camino in Spain 2 years after my surgery.  Appreciate your content, keep up your excellent work as well as the walking.
🙏 rest up 👉❤️
Idea. Produce a song from start to finish. It might 5, 10 or 20 videos long. Work on the song, write it, record it produce it. Just show all the steps. Maybe it takes 6 months or longer. Thats ok.
Glad to see you're recovering well! Heal up Rick!
My dad had heart surgery a few months ago.  He's gone from barely being able to walk from the bedroom to the kitchen to being able to do work around the house and garden.  And he's in his late 70s.  You don't notice the slow deterioration from day to day, but you sure do notice it once it's repaired.  All the best for a speedy recovery 👍👍
So Glad you found a Cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. World renown for Heart Failure Research. The Absolute best in the world. Your condition is common for your age. Thank you for sharing your health experience and music tidbits. I am sure you know many of your fans and viewers are of your age or older. Your interviews are great, with great questions. Your guests are talkative and share as well. Still waiting for many future, tasteful and quality gems. God speed recovery to you and your future body of incredible work. Your legacy will endure and content will be one of towering respect for modern times and decades past.  Thank you so much.
Glad  you're  doing  better  my brother-in-law  had heart surgery  2 times in 20 years he is 66 2:56
Great epoch to be alive!  keep up the great work , You are a national treasure!   Takes courage to grow old ( 63 here) and loving every minute ...
It’s important not to miss a beat.. but more important not to miss a heartbeat. ❤
Hey Rick, Glad you’re doing well, always praying for you, Love you buddy!!!
Glad to see you back home Rick and doing good after surgery, best wishes, the beat, literally goes on.
Glad everything went well and you're on the mend!
SO glad you’ve had a very successful surgery.
Glad you are OK Rick!
We ❤ you … keep rockin’
I have genetic cardiovascular disease and heart disease, and I'm going on 54. I'm in really good shape and continue to be very proactive in my health. Different situation from your issue. But kinda hit home listening to your story.  Glad your recovering well. I got your bundle about a month ago and had some technical problems. But I am starting dig into your lessons. So far, I am very intrigued. Thank you for providing these lessons at a steal. 🤘
Great to see you up and around, Rick.  All the best!
I’m so freaking out!  I adore u & can’t remember my world before you. I am grateful for u & your fan. We all love u. Don’t do anything like this again! It’s too scary!
Speedy recovery Rick!! And continued good health going forward!!
Glad you're back and Healthy !
Glad you are healthy. You’re a huge part of music for me.
We are proud of our CLE Clinic Rick. If we knew you were coming we would have rolled out the red carpet. Get well.
Glad everything went well.
Freeze Rick—I’d be scared fecees-less. You’re just taking this like another day. Epic strength. Prayers for a continued and speedy recovery.
Deo gratias! Beato vivente apud nos, beati sumus!
Glad you're feeling well Rick!  Looking forward to all your future content.  As far as content goes, I'd love to get some guidance on what I need to learn/study to go from somebody who can play songs that I learn and copy from YouTube tutorials, to someone that can improvise and begin creating solos and melodies on my own.  Would like to figure out what that "jump" entails, whether it be learning more music theory or something else.
Glad to see you are doing so well Rick!
Glad to hear all went well!
Very nice to hear you are doing fine after the surgery Rick. I really enjoy your videos!
Best wishes. You are handling it very well. Speaks well of your loving support system
I'm glad you're okay Rick. The world's a better place with you in it. Good Health & Blessing.
Glad you are healing!
You look fantastic for just having open heart surgery. Had the same MV surgery 20 years ago so welcome to the “zipper club”. Only complication I had was about 10 years after where I had to have an ablation because the scar tissue caused aberrant electrical pathways that caused arrhythmias. Best wishes!
I'm glad things went good. Best of luck my freind!
So glad you’re OK. 🙏❤️✌️🎸💪😎
Glad to see you are feeling better, Rick. Cheers to good health !
Quick recovery. You have great musical taste and the best interviews of musicians I have seen. Keep it up!
Godspeed Mr. B.
Happy it went well and you're doing good Rick. I love all your content almost the same but I do miss the hangs with Rhett and Dave. Twist my arm and I'd want more what makes this song great. All the best to you and your family.
Rick, you are an absolute gift and joy to us all. Continue to rock!
Glad to hear you're on the mend.
Glad you're back and feeling well.  You have a great channel.
Get well.  Slow and easy.
Thank God you are ok Rick!!  You are a music angel to all of us and even though I don’t know you, you seem like a genuine great man. Glad to hear the heart is prime and up and running.
Prayers for Rick&Family!
I had a heart attack last year at aged 38. It's one of the most scary times ever! There is no need for surgery (fingers crossed!), glad you're recovering well.
Desde Colombia nos alegra mucho saber que estas bien 😊
Since you’re asking, we need a Pneuma breakdown.
Great to have you back!
Fantastic News! ❤
Glad you're doing well Rick. I underwent triple bypass surgery 4 years ago, July 5th, 2020, when I was 62. For the better part of the preceding year I would get easily winded walking a hundred yards. Since then, I ride a recumbent bike 10-15 miles 3to 5 times a week. I hope your recovery and life goes on as well.
God bless Rick!  You are an inspiration at 62, peak of your career, kids still at home…those things keep us going!  Here’s to another 62 years on that heart❤❤❤
Welcome back Rick! I'm just a few years behind you---I hope I still have your energy when I get to 62! You're an inspiration!
So glad you're doing well, stay healthy. God bless.
Keep rocking!
Um. Didn't your heart stop when you first met your wife? Or your first acid trip?  Or that time with that near miss accident?  Funny is ... 😅
Like and subscribe if you love this channel.
I wish you the best bro...
I’m so glad your surgery was a success Rick. I’m 63 and like you, have been playing music since the early 70’s. I have enjoyed your channel for several years and look forward more years with you!
Im glad you're doing well and recovering! Great to hear your story Rick!
Thank God for all those academic nerds that stayed in medical school for another 10 years after high school .   Get well soon 😊
Glad you are feeling better. Take care of yourself. Love the content. Hope you able to more interviews - they are relaxed and informative. Amazing some of the “big names” you have been able to get. Love your song break downs top- hopefully the silly copy right holders will come to their senses and allow new generations of fans to fully appreciate this great music from the past and present.
I’ve worked with Cardiologists who trained there. A pioneering centre. You have the best
Good news! Hope you recover quick. You should write a song .. think about it 😉
Get well soon
<3
Don't cough!  So glad everything went well.
Hey Rick, love you dude. My husband has the same thing you have and he’s been watching it for years… Glad you’re on the mend! You rock!
Happy all went well Rick!🙏
So glad the surgery went well, Rick, and that you're feeling great. I'm not even a guitarist or musician but I love watching your videos. Keep well!
Good to see you back, Rick! We love you.
I just wanted to wish you a speedy recovery and remember to take it easy....I know the feeling, four heart attacks, two resuscitations and a plethora of heart meds....62 and I'm still here enjoying life ....and my black strat! Warmest regards, HM
You're looking great Rick.   How about a What Makes This Song Great for  "Start Me Up"  .  I think the timing is perfect!
Man! Speedy recovery! Good to hear!
Good to hear all went well. looking good my man. take care and recover.
I love the interviews. Keep them coming!!!
Rick you are a the worlds music proff thank you for all that you do
My biggest concern for what you went through is staph infection. Glad to see you doing well sir!
Glad you're back.  Looks like you lost some weight which is normal for these kinds of things.  You just extended your life another 30 years!
Glad to hear you are doing well Rick! Have been following since day one and will continue to do so.🤟 And please take care of yourself🙏
Glad you’re recovering well, Rick.
Glad the surgery went well Rick. Love you man. Praying for you continually.
Hope you recover well dear Rick! For more years and music to come! Long life my friend
God bless, Rick
Rick, I absolutely enjoy all you do for music! Keep doing the interviews, discussing the many different music topics, and discussing the realty regarding how technology has affected the industry! Lastly, glad you made it through your heart procedure and I hope you have another lifetime to live!
Glad you're doing well, Rick.  We are the same age, so I relate pretty well.   One of my friends posted a meme, the gist of it was two guys talking and the one says "I'm at the age where the doctor tells me I have two options: live with it, or live without it."
Rick, I love the Cleveland Clinic. I first went there 61 years ago when I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. They were great, getting me started on a path that's still going strong, though not without complications (many of them), but that's just the way it is with T1D. So thankful, and grateful.   Keep going, Rick! Take care of yourself, and us, too, musically.
Glad to see you healthy dude. I'd love to see you interview John Williams and Joe Satriani.
I'm glad you seem to be recovering well Rick. Personally,  I'd like to see a return to "what makes this song great". I know you had reasons for not doing them anymore, but I really love those episodes!
Hello Rick, glad to hear that ur surgery went well, & ur doing so much better! 😂❤😊
All the best, Rick! God bless, keep healing and continued recovery.
Wishing you a long life Rick.
Lifelong Cleveland resident here--glad you came to see us at the Clinic and most probably the Rock Hall. So very very happy you're doing so well. :)
Hello Rick.have a good recovery. God bless you in your recovery
Amazing what science has accomplished in health care. My dad had a similar surgery 26 years ago, didn't go as planned and spent 8 months in ICU before 3 months in rehab then dying. Wishing you the best.
Great to see you're on the mend, looking foreword to  new videos
Glad you're doing better.
Glad to hear you’re proactive. Prayers your way! Love your channel. Keep it going!!!
👍👏😊💖 Hoping this causes you to consider there is God who loves you and desires fellowship with you.🤗🙏
Really glad that you're doing so well after surgery Rick! I'm 65 and also had a tricky surgery done. Love your channel. You're a cool cat!
Hello from Rochester, Rick! Glad to see you're feeling better. As far as direction for your channel, I've always wanted to see something about bands who became famous locally and had at least one hit but who could never quite get that big break. I think of 805 as one of the bands. Another band from the late 70s to early 80s was New England which had a big AOR hit called "Don't Ever Wanna' Lose You" and another guitarist from Nashville who called himself "Mychael" and who had a great AOR hit called "Neon Dreams." In the meantime, take care and no lifting of any amps, etc.!
No heavy lifting, Rick:  just Fenders. No Gibsons, especially Les Pauls. We want you around a long time!
Bless you Rick, much love
Great channel Rick...! Take care.
Omygosh, Rick! You had heart surgery a week ago? You're looking and sounding good. Take care of yourself; follow the lift instructions.  Play every day, and walk when you can. Good luck and good health to you.
Glad you’re doing well ! ❤
Glad to see you’re doing well❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Follow the doctors orders. Be well!
I would like to see more song breakdowns, videos, 30 minutes or shorter. Glad you're doing well. Best.
Best wishes from one old dude to another… love your channel.  See if you can get Alex Lifeson on… I’d love to pick his brain.
We love you Rick.
Thank you for the music and the insights, Rick. Take good care of yourself, just being able to play guitar is already a big blessing!!! We all wish you a speedy recovery 🙏
Prayers for you Rick, glad you are doing better, you're a national treasure.
Real music is for and from real people.
Glad it went well.  And you're somewhat lucky. Don't they just do a simple mitral clip for mitral valve repair?  I have leakage, but the aortic valve....no quick surgery for that one...😔
Welcome back Rick .... Here's to another 62 years
Glad you're doing well Rick!
you didn't plug the Rock Hall O Fame
Rick I've never really thought about you age. To me you look exactly the same as you did a decade or so ago when I first started watching your channel.  You're like one of those people ageless people that looks eternally in their early 50's that you expect to be around forever. I hope you're well and will be around for many more years to come
Get well soon!!
Happy to hear surgery was successful and recovery is going well. Wishing you happiness and good health for many years to come!
Congrats and continued health!
glad you're doing better Rick! The music world definitely needs you around more than ever.
we are lucky to have you. glad you are doing well. doctors are amazing. peace and love. get mccready on here
Nice to hear youre in great shape Rick!
Rest up brother. You look and sound terriffic! I hear good music helps the soul heal faster!😄
Glad you are doing well Rick..
Sending good mojo your way Rick. You are loved amongst your community (4.35 million and counting). Glad you feel a little better. Love your channel! Prayers to ya!
Hey Rick. A few years over you. Had a 4-vessel graft 5 years ago. Got the chest/abdomen, forearm and lower leg scars to show for it. 😁😉 When you cough, hug a pillow hard, or hug yourself if you can’t find a pillow quickly enough. It really helps! Wishing you all the best and know it only gets better from here on. 😉
Best to you in your health, Rick!
I kinda love music break donw. That's what got me into your channel. But i also love moving forward.
Good on ya
Speedy recovery, Rick!
Nice to know you are back in tune 🔧🪚🗡
"And in the end, the love you take... is equal to the love you make". Best regards from the other side of the world of music: Buenos Aires, Argentina - Adrian K. (69)
Welcome Rick Have a good recovery 🙏💪
Glad you're doing better Rick- it's amazing the fatigue you feel when you're heart is not at 100% (I also know from personal experience). I would love your list of  "top 10 tips" for song writers to make their songs more interesting musically. Hope to meet you personally one day!
I'm so glad you're doing well. Praise God.
Thankfully you have gotten through all this, and well on the mend!   We are all blessed for it!     Thank you for the update.  You remain in our prayers!
Wish you well Rick!!!  I dig the interviews of my GenX singers, songwriters and musicians.  Todays music is mostly bad.
glad your well.  video idea for gear nerds. how about going through your amp collection one by one. pick a guitar and give a play through and your stories of that particular gear and what you like about it.
Hey Rick, My name is Stuart Brandt from Naples Florida. Keep getting better every day. Better and better and every way. Sorry to hear you had to have the surgery. I thought they could go in through your under your arm or your back or something. Just curious. Be well....😢
Glad all is good, sir. Keep up the great work!
Haha this is so crazy to me. You look like you are doing amazing!I had open heart surgery last year, my second one. I’m 35, I had lots of pain and couldn’t move or breathe well for a while. I’m just amazed at how good you look after such a short amount of time haha. All the best Rick!
That you are up and making videos a week after open heart surgery is amazing. Your recovery is telling and means many more years of good health for you.
So happy your surgery went well.  Prayers for a speedy recovery!
Next time you’re in Cleveland, for anything….look me up….we will go catch some walleye, eat them same day and then we’ll party and stay up all night jamming at the marina!    Godspeed on your recovery….
Wow! Tough content. You DO look fragile. Thin. A bit skinny around the edges where you are normally not. But, you did what was neccessary and I wish you the best on your return to normal life. May you regain your trademark strength, endurance and vitality soon. Thanx for sharing.
So pleased your doing well. Blessings ❤
Blimey!! That sounds serious. Glad to hear things are alright. Greetings from London.
Glad you're on the mend and getting stronger.
Welcome to the "Zipper" club. So thankful that it was successful for you. God Bless you Rick!!
Hey Rick, Glad that you are doing well.  7 years ago I ended up with a quad bypass, so I feel your pain.  I will keep you in my prayers, may God bless you and your family!
Support !
Godspeed Rick.  Glad you had a successful surgery and are on the mend.  We need you around and making your usual fantastic content.
Glad your doing well, I enjoy your channel immensely. I had bypass surgery 2 years ago and the worst part of it was pain from sneezing or coughing. God bless ...
Glad you're well and things are working, Rick. ♫♫♫
Glad you’re doing so well, Rick. I had my mitral valve repaired two years ago; in my case I lucked out in having a top notch cardiothoracic surgeon locally, which made the whole experience easier. My recovery wasn’t as quick as yours, but it was still pretty remarkable, and now I feel better than I have in years.
I mean Rick, human body is the perfect machine. And your one is also the most beautiful body of YouTube. A total recover in a week is the bare minimum you should expect from a marvellous body like yours
Incredible how far we have come in medicine.
Amazing, Take it easy Rick.. You are one of USA s finest . Bless ya  !  as Neil sez..Keep on rocking in the free world. Andy..Jarrow. England.
You joined the club Rick. I had the same procedure done 10 years ago at about the same age. My serious moment was when I was chasing my grand daughter at a park and I almost passed out. Operation done about a week after that. It took me about 2 months to get back to normal. For two weeks I could only sleep in my recliner. You are looking good and I wish you all the best. As to what kind of show to have...ever explain why/how you use all your guitars and amps and other equiment we see in you studio?
God bless you Rick.
So glad to see you doing well.  Love your channel.
Glad you’re okay. I’m a heart failure patient, in full recovery thankfully. Anything relating to the heart is scary. Glad you have the surgery behind you.
I'm glad that you're okay and you have shared your expérience. I'm learning every time I'm watching your channel but the most important is take care of yourself and your family.
Rick, speedy recovery. May I suggest some song breakdowns on instrumentals like Satriani and Kenny G. Am not sure what it is (probably chord structure if I can call it that) but some of ‘em hits me differently, while some I just don’t get at all (like Steve Vai).
glad you are feeling better :)
Man, great to know you feel better, I work in medical devices industry and part of my training on the product use was to go into a surgery room and witness a couple of open-heart surgery procedures from beginning to end, it's a long dramatic procedure but last change for your heart to go back to a good phase and rhythm, SOFT ROCK AND ROLL FOR NOW OK!!!!
Get well soon.  Take your time and God speed.  🤟🏼🙏🏻
Great deal glad you are recovering.  At my age vould be me
Glad you are on the mend Rick!
We love you, Rick. Hope your full recovery is swift.
Get well soon.
Thank you for sharing this. It helps us all. Best wishes to you. ❤
Glad to hear you are doing well. Keep up the great work.
Rick, we are the same age. I am a drummer, and I love the channel. I had a valve replacement about 12 years ago. Take it seriously not to pick up anything heavy. The sternum needs weeks to mend like any broken bone. I was told it is very difficult to reset properly. NO DRUMMING for me for a while. All good now. The work they can do now is amazing. Give it time and heal well.
Yeah im next... got pace maker.. but something hurts.. a lot..
Rock on, Rick, you can do it!
Inspiring! I’m going to have the same operation in December. I won’t lie, I’ve been concerned. You sound great and energetic! Best for the rest of your recovery.  BTW, I teach theory at a couple of local colleges and your channel always gives me great ideas.
So glad to hear everything is okay Rick! Did this episode scare your kids? Sometimes it can be a shock for the younger members of the family to for the first time become aware of a parents' mortality. I hope you have a long, healthy and prosperous life ahead!
Glad to see your o  the mend❤😊
Rick, welcome to the “zipper club”. I got a new aorta valve in 2015 and never looked back. Rock on!
Very happy to hear you are doing great. God bless you in your continued recovery. Looking forward to your ongoing videos.
Glad it worked out! It’s amazing what they can do these days.
So glad the surgery went well!
Congrats on a successful operation. See you on the funnies.
Mitral valve regurgitation just took my beloved mom at 70. She was incredibly dynamic and had such a full life, also a musician. I will never understand why her cardiologists did not see it until she had reached the severe stage despite having the exhaustion and shortness of breath for YEARS. I’m so glad you had this outcome!!
I’m a triple bypass guy from back in 2000.  I’m still going strong.  Wishing you the best.
long life ! much respect from mexico
Welcome to the zipper club, Rick! Glad you’re doing well after that adventure. Be well, mate.
Rick I’m a cardiac anesthesiologist, and your surgery is what I do for work all day… if you only knew how many people at the hospital talk about your videos.  Glad your on the mend
Glad to hear everything went well, Rick! Best wishes for a trouble-free recovery! I really enjoy your song breakdowns, since it makes me listen to music differently! Take care.
I’d love to talk with you someday and learn more from the man himself in Person !
Rick, Glad all went well. We need you brother.  You have the best channel as far as I'm concerned. Keep doing what you're doing! With Love, Cw
❤
Thank You Rick for letting us know how you are doing. I too have a problem with my heart, I had a pacemaker put in in 2017. I was 40 years old when it happened, but today I feel great. I Love your videos, please keep doing what you do.
Rick, glad you’re well. As for ideas for new videos. You could have bands send in audition tapes and then get together with the winner and write songs recorder album and put it out there and video the entire thing naturally.
10 lbs! You can’t play a Les Paul. 😂 Glad you’re doing okay bud! Get better! Big fan!
Glad to see you back Rick. So glad you're doing well.
Just glad you're okay, Rick. Keep on...
My Dad had a heart attack in January & we’ve been blessed to have him in good health these days. i’m happy to see you both in good health.   Nothing over 10 pounds, so stay away from les paul’s! Haha
Sounds like you can play guitar, but just not anything as heavy as a Les Paul. Glad to hear the surgery went well.
You have to make sure to sit on a very soft thing when playing guitar. Then pay attention to that guitar line on your thigh, this should stop any cardio thrombosis causing you to lose your toes.Aroha.
Glad to see you’re recovering well.
I'm so glad this was handled successfully!  We need you to stay healthy for all the upcoming interviews, analyses and other amazing videos you will do.  I'll think about some ideas for upcoming video ideas.  Stay healthy!
Best of health.  God bless
So glade you’re ok.❤❤❤
You’ve given me much joy and I can only send you good vibrations! Hope you recover quickly and have a long beautiful life ahead!
Id like you to talk some about gear, your fave plug ins and what you thinks about irs like tonex. Good to see things went will.. nice one.
Get well soon.
Rick, great to hear you are doing well during recovery! Appreciate your insight and dedication to music!
Ow wow get better soon Rick
Great news Rick.
Excellent!  Glad everything went well!
Rick, I would really like to see you make more in-depth breakdowns of various songs where you isolate the vocals and different instruments👍  One of my all-time favorite videos of yours was your in-depth breakdown of the song "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel👍
Stay healthy, brother!
God Bless you Rick. Glad to hear it went well.
Of COURSE Rick went to the "Heart of Rock n 'Roll" for heart surgery! Nothing less would be appropriate. Glad it went so well, and thank you for all you do!
My dad had this done. Then 5 yrs later a couple weeks ago he had to have emergency stints put cuz the original triple by pass surgery started failing. Blood pressure went thru the roof ect. Mom took him into the er & they caught it. Prayers for u. Love your channel
So glad your surgery was a success. We need you around for a long time yet. I'll keep you in my thoughts.
Cleveland is so much more than the West Side Market, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Polish Boys.  The Cleveland Clinic is world reknowned.  Glad you're doing great, Rick.  I don't play, but I watch your videos anyway.
Glad to see you're doing better.
Rick, another 62 year old guitarist chiming in here....so glad things went well and you're on the mend.  Absolutely love your channel and I'm here daily to see what's new.  Keep up the good work!
wow looking good for recent surgery.  I had aortic valve replaced at age 51, 5 years ago.  Put me in a lot of discomfort for a month, would not be talking with my hands like that so soon.  cheers, glad it went really well!
Glad you are doing well! I had a cardiac ablation at Cleveland Clinic recently and it went great. Lucky I live near Cleveland. Some of the best doctors in the world at the Clinic.
Blessings, Rick!
Great news RIck! Sending you our love.
Glad to hear you're doing well, Rick!  Wishing you continued good health and many more years of bestowing your wisdom upon us.  You've created such a great channel here and all the content is gold, but I'd love to see you get back to doing the song breakdowns again on a more consistent basis.  Lots of brilliant music out there still waiting for your "What Makes This Song Great?" analysis.
The thumbnail had me worried, but I'm so glad to hear you're doing great, Rick! We need you!!! :) <3
God bless you Rick
Yay! Glad you are doing well🎉
Long live and many music videos to Mr. Rick Beato!
Wishing you only the best of health forward
Glad to know everything went well Rick.
Love the artist interviews, but man, do I mis WMTSSG! Glad you're doing well!
So glad everything went well!
Glad you're feeling better Rick. Sending good vibes. The interviews have been awesome this year! Stay well!
Man you look great! I bet the Dr's couldn't believe how big a heart you have !
Thank you Rick for sharing!  I have one question,  what was the first song you played when you picked up your guitar after the surgery?
don't play old Les Pauls they weigh in around 12 pounds.
Good to hear you are doing well. Onward and upward!
Glad you’re feeling good and recovering well, Rick!  As for the channel, just keep doing what you do and we’ll roll with the changes. Your instincts have been great so far.
Get well and stay well.
Mitral valve prolaps.   My younger brother has had this since birth but didn't get diagnosed until he was in early teens.   He is a 10th Don in karate but retired from teaching Karate a few years ago.  I'm 69 and he is 66. We grew up in Syracuse NY, in a small town called Mattydale/Hinsdale.  So Rick I am glad that to see your coming along and doing better.  Stay well Rick, can't wait to see you back in action on your channel  Best Regards  Gary B (Denver, CO)
So glad you're all patched up and feeling good again! I would love to hear you reflect on some particular albums: Captain Beyond (1st albun), Wishbone Ash 'Argus.'  To me, these are stand-out albums that are unrivalled in at least some respects - compositionally and performatively pretty near the top of their  respective art forms.
Reggeaton has done this to u
NE Ohio hopefully took good care of you!!
So happy you are doing well! God bless!
Love this guy. He’s phenomenal. I’m 29. Hope I grow up to be like you when I’m in my 60’s.
It’s great to see you back. You really do have great followers on this channel.
Do any old thing you want, I'll watch!
Thank God you are in good hands 🙏 Take care.
Whatever you’re interested in Rick is usually interesting to listen to for others. Glad you’re doing well!
You ARE a national treasure! Your musical knowledge is awesome, and your sharing it with us is wonderful. So glad you were able to take care of this while you're still young and able to bounce back physically. No use waiting on something like this! Get 'er done!!! Really glad you're feeling well, Rick. Hope to have you around for many, many, many years to come.
Well done. You look great
Rick, glad to see you sitting upright and healthy, so quick, too, and talking through the years of watching and the symptoms was really helpful. Have a very pleasant recovery!!!
Do what you love on this channel, Rick! We'll watch the videos as long as we see your passion for the music. Best wishes and we're happy you had a quick recovery!
People who live in NE Ohio are very fortunate to have some of the best health care professionals on planet Earth living and working there too!
My wife had the the same surgery by Dr. Gillanov last July; he has done more of those surgeries than anyone on the planet with a 91% + success rate. You landed in great hands.
Rick - I had a 5mm hole in my aortic valve. My BP was 90/40. Take rehab slowly. Do not hang from anything or push anything heavy. Take walks. That’s how I rehabbed. Get well.
Am so glad your surgery was a success! Your a amazing person and your channel has brought knowledge and joy to all who watch! Love the interviews!
God bless you, brother.  Keep on keepin' on and know that you and your family are in our prayers!
Glad your doing better Rick!!!
10lb weight lift limit… leave those Les Paul’s in the rack.
glad to hear it went well.  Be well and take care in this early recovery.
Glad you’re feeling better Rick.
Glad you are doing well.
Dear Rick, Hoping you have a speedy recovery.  Glad you paid attention, and got the medical care you needed. Your videos are all amazing.   ||:  Amazing :|| You've touched our lives in great ways.  Looking forward to many more healthy years for you!
Glad the procedure was successful and that you’re feeling well. ❤🎉
Glad to hear the good news!   Keep rockin'!
Praise God that you are recovering nicely. Good to see you up and about! I will keep you in my prayers.😮
Wishing you a speedy recovery Rick. Looking forward to many more years of music breakdowns and what makes this song great.  There's only one Rick Beato. A Great channel with a new heart!
I would be curious as the days weeks, months go on, how that ‘incident’ changes you and your new perspective’s on life… if any? But I’m going to guess you will notice something.
Great you're well, Rick.  Marvellous xo
I thank God for your successful surgery and recovery , i always love your music and guitar lessons.
Life is precious - Good health to you Rick!
So happy you are doing well my friend. All of us wish you all the best- and you are obviously doing great !!!!! Keep on rockin' buddy !!!
I am so amazed how fast you recovered from suegery. Perhaps, a little too much on the details of the procedure, but powerful message. I would like to see some videos on jazz songs, if you feel it’s ok.
Glad you came thru with flying colors, Rick! The music world needs you to stick around for a long time.
Welcome back, Rick.
I have many stents in my heart which is not the same as the surgery you had of course, but any time the heart is involved it's a big deal. I'm glad you are back in action and feeling "frisky".  I dusted off my old Hagstrom II I played in college (50 years ago) and bought a used amp to relearn the guitar and your channel was key in kicking me in the ass to get back in it. I like your "how to" videos and how players get the sound they do from their instruments.  You are an inspiration, Rick.
Thinking of you and your continued recovery.
I thought you were in California?
Gald that you are alright, Rick. I'd love to see more what makes this song great from the Grunge era.
Wishing you a speedy recovery!
The long form interviews are awesome. Often you ask things the normal music media doesn’t ask. Keep them coming. Praying for rest and healing for you
I wish you a good recovery. hugs from Brazil.
Glad everything went well. Upward and onward.
RICK!!!!   So glad to hear you are better! Amazing surgery for one amazing guy!!  Super happy for you and that you can still play guitar.
Great news Rick so glad to hear it. I love your channel and what you do. PS chick dig scars, just like they do drummers.
God bless you Rick Beato!  Thank God you are alright!
This is also a message for everyone out there, dont be afraid to go get checked out. Way too many people get surprised by things and can even lose their lives for letting things slide for too long. See look at Rick, not so scary is it?
Great to hear that it went well Rick. I really love your chats with musicians,producers,sound people in particular.
OMGbRicky, my dad had a bad mitral valve . He had open heart surgery back in 1975 in Long Island. You look great for such a current surgery. Get well soon Ricky B! We all love you up here in. Rhinebeck, NY!!
Glad to hear the surgery was successful and you are recovering well. As far as the direction of the channel… you’ve been doing Gods work with these interviews. I would love to hear a “double” interview with Michael Beinhorn and Frank Filipetti together. It’s one of the most interesting and mysterious working relationships/collaborations that produced very important music and yet little is known about it.
The heart of the matter. Good health to you
Get well soon..
Glad it went well!
Best health care in the world is in my hometown! Glad you’re on the mend Rick! God bless.
Best wishes for a speedy recovery!
There’s got to be a great song waiting to be written about your heart stopping for the first time since you were born (actually conceived). Pretty profound. Rock on Rick!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Hey Rick, Fellow Ithaca College graduate here, (same year as you). Happy to hear that you are well and sending healing vibes. Your channel has been a breathe of fresh air these past years, with educational insight, and a passion that is contagious. All the best for the future. Cheers, Eric Jenney
10lb. limit?  No more Les Pauls for you!
So glad you are doing well Rick !
It´s great to see you in good health, Rick! Keep going!

HUrray for Rick !
Up and going like a champ. Heck yeah Rick glad you're patched up buddy, love ya!
Hope you have Parker fly. 😅 Get well, I enjoy your channel.
Great to hear you are doing well!!!
Rick im a few months younger than you but in 2013 I was told That 95%of my arteries were blocked due to smoking for years I had to have a triple bypass,it is very scary and Im glad you found a good Surgeon ,my Cardiologist told me that I will never get feeling back in my chest where the incision was made not true at all ,some of these Doctors just go by therories ,anyways im happy you got it taken care of ,you did a interview with a old drummer that showed how he tunes his drums and I   cant seem to find the interview,but I would like to see more things like that from the old Greats and how they did things ,Best wishes Brother
This is the first I'm learning about your heart issues. I'm so happy that you go through the surgery so well. Stay well!
Rick your heart surgery was on google!! Obviously you have hit the big time!!! I’m glad you’re doing so well !! Looking forward to any new content..
10 LB?  Weigh that Les Paul just to be safe.  =D
Take care best wishes....when it comes to music- you da man!
That's great news Rick. Take care.
Congratulations on your amazingly-fast recovery from major surgery.
I'm someone who loves your commentary on music. Thankful that you are recovering well. Blessings for you and all who love you.
So glad to see you are on the mend.  Keep the music alive for us.   Your encouragement of young people to learn, play and cultivate the joy of music is wonderful.  See you in your next video.
Praise God man so happy it was successful I love your content and all my friends do you’re the man.
Glad you're doing good Rick.  I recently found out I have some heart concerns and was told that I should be good for 3 - 5 years.  It's not quite the same thing as you but I am feeling extreme fatigue, that's what brought me to the cardiologist to begin with.  Best of health Rick.  God bless.  🙏
So glad you're felling better Rick!
I started listening to your channel after I had a heart attack in 2017
Rick, so glad things went well for you and it's good to see you up and about. I am, unfortunately, intimately familiar with open heart surgery; my daughter has Congenital Heart Disease and my car practically drives itself to the medical centers in Boston. If I can be so bold as to offer one piece of advice, it is this: listen to your body. It will tell you when it's time to rest. God Bless!
Good to hear you are doing well. i love your show. i like the fact that you talk with so many musicians and recording people that it's great to hear all the back stories about the music they make. Even though at times they are talking above my knowledge of music. keep up the great work you do.
hope you get better i had a aortic issue ...cleveland clinic too it was a few months after i had complications so take it slow sir.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love from Sardinia
Right. anb the covid vaccine had nothing to do with it. If so... please Rick educate your self DO NOT vaccinate any more... with nothing.
Great to have you back Rick!! Glad your surgery went well, and you're back on the mend!!
Good news. Be well
Rick: I'm so very glad and grateful your surgery went well and you're ok!
Great news, you're feeling good and back at it. Cleveland Clinic saved my wife's life. They are the best. Love the channel, mostly the interviews. But really it's all interesting and worth a watch.
I'm glad you are feeling better! 🤗👍
LONG LIVE RICK!
Great news!
Best wishes from Glasgow Scotland!!
Fellow recent zipper recipient here. And fan of your channel. Continued successful recovery!
Congrats and stay healthy!
Very glad your heart surgery went well. You've got a great heart. Keep it beating. We love you!
Soooo Glad we get to keep Rick around for a spell! Thank you Lord for continued blessings!
Very glad that you had a great operation.  You are so good and thoughtful in your interviews that I am learning something new everytime I watch your channel.   God bless you and all your endeavors.
Some rock stars regurgitate booze  Rick's heart overflows with love for music so strongly that its valve regurgitates blood. That's so metal 🤘🤘
Long live for Beato!!!❤
Thank you for updating us on your condition.  We need you healthy. I love the interview heavy content!
Hey Rick. I'm happy for you recovery ! I am 20 from Northern France and have some pretty bad heart problems, had 5 myocariditises, 3 perycaditises and suffer from cardiac fibrosis since 2018 for clinically unknown reasons. Still holding up for now !   I've been watching your channel for a year or two, and you have a pretty big influence on my guitar technic and theory. Your videos helps a lot in my music conservatory.  Take it easy and have a fantastic day/evening !
Glad to hear everything went smoothly!  Take care, Rick. You are a musical treasure on YouTube 😘
Love the interviews Rick!  Please keep em coming
So thankful for science and your speedy recovery!
Glad to see you're doing so well! Congratulations on the awesome recovery!
🙏🏻❤️
Great it went well and you're recovering. 62 is still "young"-- good age for such surgery! Rock on!
❤God bless ❤ speedy recovery records😊
Glad you're doing well, Rick. Thank you for all you do for the music community, musicians and appreciators. Speedy healing!
Rick, do whatever you damn well please!   You earned it.  Medical science can do some amazing things.  That's awesome!
Terrific attitude, which is such a key factor. All the best wishes for a prompt, 110% full recovery, Rick. Take care!
More interviews!  Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee should be on your list.
I have the same issue and will need the same procedure at some point, but even with insurance I don't know how I'm going to pay for it. I'm glad you had it done and seem to be doing very well! I look forward to you channel every week!
stay healthy!
To your health - Cheers!  Re videos, your interviews have historical significance, and are amazingly enjoyable. More please.
Very happy all went well 👍
take care Rick, may you be given good health
Hello Rick, great to hear your surgery went well and that you are doing good! Looking forward to some new video's. Greetings from the Netherlands, Stay safe!
While listening to Spotify while working, I've started to click on the details for songs - Who wrote it? Who Recorded and Produced it etc. I like to think I even cared to look in some measure because of your channel Rick and you demystifying the magic and story of the industry. I find myself wanting to know more about the stories of the songs - How they came to be, with touch points from all the makers along the way. More stories of how the songs came to be and the people who brought them to pass, in addition to the lead Vocals etc. Sorry if this is what you've always done. Glad you're back on tour, as it were.
Why do I watch your channel, because you make me love music again.
So happy that you're doing well!  After being in Cleveland you may want to consider doing a video on The Agora. A great rock venue with much history in the Cleveland area. The phenomenal guitarist Frank Marino plays there often and has some great Agora recordings.  You should try to get him on your channel for an interview! Be well !
Hey Rick, I’m glad you’re okay. So you had an adventure without us but thank goodness you’re still here with us. Bless you my friend. I always call everybody friend. Never a foe because that be crazy.
❤❤❤
Glad your back, Rick. You're looking well! So pleased to hear that the operation went smoothly. Take care and God bless.
Love you Rick! You’re tops! Prayers for a continued recovery!
Alles gute aus Deutschland! Grüße, Gerhard
Glad to see you your back Rick !
My father in law had a complete bursting of his mitral valve 24 years ago.  At the time they gave him optimistically 10 percent chance of surviving. He passed away last year from complications of Lewy body dementia.  So glad you had this done, so we can selfishly continue to enjoy your talents and music. Wishing you a fast and safe recovery.
we need you Rick! so glad you had a good experience  :) love the interviews w/some of the bands i grew up with. do miss the song breakdowns too
Thank God you're ok Rick! Glad to hear you're on the mend.
So glad everything worked out for you Healthwise Rick! Listen to them Doctors! No lifting any guitars over 10lbs... Especially non-chambered Pauls! 😉
Your angel guardian in action.
Glad you're ok. It's remarkable how fast they get you up and round after surgery these days.
Glad everything went well! You look perfectly fine. Hey, you were in OHIO, and probably went on 77. Next when you go for a check up you can stop by my place for a visit! ( I'm also 62!)
Thank you Rick!  Speedy recovery.
Great to see you are doing well, Rick!
god bless! ,recover  well
I'm amazed at your resilience.  Congratulations on the positive outcomes and for all the great videos and insights into music and its creators.  Best wishes and glad to hear of the positive recovery...  -Dean S.
God bless you, Rick. Stay healthy and strong. We need you, and we love you. Cheers!
Long life to Rick.
Love your content and I wish you well.
Best wishes for always. So pleased that things have worked out so well for you. Love your channel.
Take care, Rick.
Glad your healing up and doing well.... keeping you in my prayers...
It's great to hear you feeling much better!  I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers! Keep up the good work on Youtube!
Listen to Mahler's Ninth symphony, especially the first movement.  I realize this might be a bit of a stretch for you...
Great to see you bounce back Rick :)
Congrats on successful surgery, Rick, and all the best with your recovery
Prayrs for your recovery, brother.
Welcome to the zipper club, Sir!
Thank you for your report!  I'm happy you are doing so well.  Modern medical technology is amazing.
❤ All the Best
Stay well mate
I didn't even know about this. I'm glad you're in good health. In terms of video suggestions, I did like some of your previous music theory stuff. But I only found those sometime ago and noticed they've been up for a long time. I also wouldn't mind something music theory related where you break down a song, a piece of music from a movie, or even a video game track. Those are always interesting to me. Anyway, again, I'm glad you're doing good.
Please do more videos jamming with your friends,Dave,Rhett Phil X etc…
So glad you're doing well!
Glad it went well 🙏🏼
Glad everything went well, dude.
I saw your Facebook post. All power to you and hope healing is swift (it seems to be). All the best.
Glad you're doing well! As far as content I enjoy a mix. Love the interviews and song breakdowns.
You've become quite a star justifiably, I as well as many others feel a close connection to you and we are elated for your good health and well being for you and your family
Glad to hear your surgery was successful! Amazing that you are back after a week. Looking forward to more great interviews and analysis.
I am happy you are doing well.
The important thing is you GOT the pillow in the shape of a heart.  I think Jackson Browne makes em.  Congrats on the great result.  Had my by-pass 8 years ago....at 62.    Rock ON!!!!
I’m glad you are well,Sir !!
We love you Rick! Godspeed to you and your family!
Get well soon Rick!!
Please take care of yourself brother. Keep your protein levels high, your body will need it for repair.
Bono had a very similar surgery
Glad everything worked out for you Rick! Enjoy your channel. I love your interviews and hope you continue them. I’d love to see you interview someone like Quincy Jones or Herb Alpert while they’re still around and active. I bet they’d have great stories about the old days.
You look a bit peaked Rick. Work in ICU with hearts all the time. Men have a tendency, especially overachievers ;), to take things a bit fast at times. Eat well, rest well, work out a bit when the doc say “ do it”; but take your time my man…you aint Mick Jagger ;).  Seriously though, wish you many days ahead of energetic joyful journeys!
get fast on your feet :)
Dio ti benedica, Rick ! God bless you !
Rick, I am a bass player, playing with a great 80s tribute band, in Ireland and follow your channel. I also have gone through heart issues, in my case, heart failure. That was four years ago but now, at 70 years old, I feel just great and rock each weekend away playing gigs with my band. I am so happy you are OK. I love your channel so keep on rocking.
Glad to hear your surgery went so smoothly and successfully. Did you (or your surgeon) choose a mechanical, pig, or human valve?
I know NOTHING about the theory of music.  I played the guitar & clarinet in the 9th grade and that was about it.   But I would listen to you talking about how The wedge is a superior salad to Caesar's salad.  You're a gifted story teller.
❤❤❤
Thrilled you had your procedure, Rick. Love you man.
I wasn't curious, but now I am.
Congrates on your successful operation . The 2 on my wish list are James Taylor and Donald Fagen . Cheers
Rick, I am glad that you had your mitral valve fixed. My mom had the same thing done and it helped her a ton. I wish you nothing but the best as you continue to heal!!!
ugh I've got chest pains now listening to this!
👀🇮🇪👍⚓
Glad to hear the surgery was a success. Wishing you a great recovery Rick. Take Care 😊
❤
I'm glad you're OK.
02:56 *Glad to see ya back already Rick!* I have an excellent idea. I'd love to see you do *Jam Session Shows!*  Each episode you can bring on a *Special Guest(s) Jammer(s) to play/sing with ya. *Not previously r3corded works either. A true Freestyle Jam Session,Rick Beato style!!!*
Great to hear that all is well.  I’m a not a musician but really enjoy your videos.  They feel as though you are talking directly to me alone. Keep up the good work for another 3 to 5 years at least lol
Welcome back. Glad you are doing well. Take care.
Thank GOD  for your successful surgery ! Take care Rick !   😊👏🏼👏👏🏻👏🏿❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
You Just Get Better Rick...We Love Ya, Brother !
You look great, Rick!!! Keep on doing what you do. Any kind of videos will be something to treasure and we are really looking forward to them!!! 💪🙏❤️
music is the best medicine RICK
Happy your doing better Rick. 🎉 stay healthy i need your channel its best music info channel.
Thank you for this heartfelt share! 🧡❤❤🧡
Great news, Rick! Continued well wishes and smooth recovery. Rock on!
Glad to hear that you are ok, and getting back to normal.  Take it easy for a while, we will wait😀
Glad you are doing well.  If you can't pick up anything over 10 lbs., you may have to avoid playing some Les Pauls ;-)
God bless you Rick.
I'm glad you are recovering well, Rick! 🙏👍
Glad you're okay man. Take it easy for a while. All the best 🍺
Glad you're doing better.  I hope things went well...GOD bless.
Rick,I'm so happy you're doing well, you mean a lot to the guitar/music community ❤😊....If I just had to comment or suggest anything it might be to have more song breakdowns and analysis. personally I enjoy pretty much everything you do brutha. Keep on keepin  on man! Glad you're doing well.
Glad you had a good experience with your MVR.
Speedy recovery, Rick. Be well.
Rick-I had the exact same issue in 2013 when I was 39, at the Cleveland Clinic. I from Cleveland and still live in the area. I feel great  today, walk 5 miles minimum daily. Best of luck to you on your recovery .
Awesome!
so glad to hear things went well - take it easy and let yourself heal - looking forward to new content
Your voice slighty raspy.
Happy you are having a successful recovery! Keep on keeping on!!
Rick, thank you most kindly for this update! I don't have a specific request as such, but as others have said, please follow your soul as your channel moves forward. Gosh, it's great to see you back!
It’s great reading all the comments and everybody spreading the love. If you are a musician or just starting out, this is the best channel out there. I personally would love to see you out on the road once in awhile. maybe even at some backstage events. Or even bring on some of your amazing fans like the young 15-year-old I just left a comment about on this thread. Keep on spreading the love, my friend.
Rick, you are a rare, humble man, and we appreciate you. Hari!
Cheers to you and your family
Best to you and yours Rick.
Hey Rick, we disagree about a LOT, however... the one thing we do not disagree about - is - I'm very glad you're still here. Dude I'm still playing in bands, writing music, playing guitar an' singing - and I'm 65 - the band's called Radio Poets!
So happy to see you back in action and doing well. Best wishes Rick! ❤
Glad you're doing well. Godspeed, Rick. 👽✌️
The interviews are unparalleled, though I wouldn't regret song break downs.
All the best Rick ❤
You’re forgetting to thank the LORD, he’s the one most responsible for you continuing to do your thing. I don’t think you’re a Christian as I don’t think you’ve had even one Christian musician on your interviews. I’ll pray that you find the giver of life eternal, life on this earth is but a mere moment in time 🙏
With all the bad news floating about it's nice to hear a positive outcome. Love a good result 👍🏻  Take care Rick. Glad to hear you're good.
GET WELL!!!❤
Glad you're on the mend!  Take it easy!
Glad you are well. Speedy recovery and stay safe. Love all your videos.
Glad you're better man! No heavy les pauls or 70's strats!
Saw it on instagram. Surprised. You definitely went to the best.  Jarring experience even if it goes well.  Glad it went well!
You look like a million dollar Rick!! God bless you!!
get well soon
Great news Rick. ❤️
Glad you are back doing well. 👍🏼🕊️🙏🏼
I am a cardiologist so understand exactly what you have been going through.  A childhood friend of mine is the chief of cardiology at the Clinic.  Very happy you took care of it when you did, and expect you will be fine.  You might find a little soreness from the sternotomy for several months.  Do the rehab and you'll be good as new.   Good luck!
Hey Rick, I noticed that your color looks great. Last few months you were looking a bit pasty white and I was starting to wonder everything is OK. Happy to see that you’re doing good and full recovery. Love the channel.!
Best wishes from Athens, Greece! 🤘
Did they put a mitral clip in?
BEATO🎼💎⚡️🥊🇺🇲🎶 GLAD YOU'RE OK SIR!!!
Love ya Rick!! God bless you brother!! Prayers for perfect health!!
Rick, glad you’re back.😊
Thank you for sharing this personal and delicate experience with us. You're a great human being and deserve the best and all the love in the world. ;)
I had a five way 20 years ago and 75 now.  Doin just fine!
Really pleased to see you’re recovering well Rick. Take a few days or weeks, but I look forward to the next re-invigorated Rick Rant! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
More white board music theory lectures. More whats great about this song artists (Laura Nyro, Tori Amos, Joe Jackson, David Crosby, Domi and Beck, Taylor Eigsti...;>)
^5!
All the best get well soon and take Your time to recover. Your work is Most precious but you are more precious. Sendung You strength from Cologne.
Take it from someone that has had 4 open heart surgeries (heart defect). It doesn't get any easier. be thankful it was just a leaky valve!
Yes - these types of operations have become almost routine.  Three years ago I had a quad. by-pass.  I had the operation on a Saturday and I was home on the following Monday.  Same thing!  They opened up my chest; did their thing, and then I woke up out of blackness, which seemed to last a total of one second.  It actually lasted several hours, I think.  I didn't even do a count-down or Anything like that.  They must have tricked me!  The worst thing about the whole event was the hospital food!   I just couldn't eat it!  So I went home.  I'm now 71 and I feel great!    Congrats. on your success!    😊👏🏻🥂.
Great !!
we love you Rick... that's all you need to know. :)
Thank you for all your work. Looking forward to years of enjoying your music wisdom: How about doing a bit on a Québec classic band, like Harmonium…Cheers Rick!
Glad you're doing well! All the best.🙏 Thank you for the update and all you do! 💗
Hey Rick! Glad everything went smoothly. I’d be interested in seeing you breakdown some of Los Lobos’s stuff.
Nice 👍
NO LES PAULS FOR YOU!  You can't lift anything more than 10 lbs.
Glad to hear everything is going so well and so quickly!!
Rick is the GOAT
Great to hear your doing well 👍👍😎
Glad your ticker's tuneup went well, we need you here for many, many more years.
Glad to hear the surgery went well!  I manage the inventory for our cardiac surgery at our local hospital and it amazes me what modern medicine can achieve these days!   Would love some more recording tips and advice on the channel!
Just glad you're OK.  You are my first Youtube friend.  I saw your first show in NY.  Not ready for you to go anywhere.
So pleased you are back and well after your major surgery. Sending you best wishes from here in England.
Speedy recovery to you.  The knowledge you share with us is very much appreciated.  Best wishes.
Congrats on a good outcome Rick. I am a member of the zipper club too. Unzipped just like you described at 44 for a pericardiectomy and my recovery was exactly as you described. Surgery on Wed., up and wandering around my room on Friday desperate to get out of there, blowing leaves on Sunday. Virtually no pain as well — it was a little surreal. My vote is for more interviews — the song breakdowns are fun but the interviews are the best, and your interviewing skills are terrific. You're always the fan and you're very good at shutting up and letting your subjects talk. It's about them, not you — you get the joke. MOAR please.
Rick, welcome to the mitral valve repair club. Glad the surgery went well and you’re on the recovery road. I had my mitral valve repaired in 2019 to fix the same type of issue. The surgeon did a nonrobotic minimally invasive repair. Keep on truckin’. We live in an amazing time for medical technology and guitar. Love your channel 💔+👩‍⚕️= ❤🎸
So glad to hear you are OK. Thank you for updating us. Praying for you.
Great to hear you got along well Rick! You look great, continued health in the future and all the best!!
We love you, Rick! You are one of a kind, an invaluable beacon for history and creativity and rock and roll. Your channel has become a part of my day-to-day regular life. Take care of yourself!🤍
So happy you have a successful result!  I pray there’s no further issues.  Looking forward to seeing new content!  No hurry! 😅
Sending prayers for steady recovery Rick from all of us on the North Coast in Cleveland, Ohio. 🙏
Feel better love your videos, they help me to keep going with my music project Carl Elizondo & The Royal Union of Architects
Get well, mate!
Rick, Thank you for posting; as another 62 year old, I'm encouraged by your success!  I'll be praying for your continued recovery.  God Bless you for your exercise of talent!
Alright! great success. You are loved and appreciated, glad to get more of you.
Great to see you looking so well, Rick. Always enjoy your videos. Greetings from Australia! 😎
Glad it went well , and your attitude to this is encouraging for all of us!  I haven’t yet had heart problems, but some other problems, and I always take a similar positive attitude to it! 🙂
I'm glad you are okay.
Thank God!! Glad you got through it! I have a stent and know the fear…
Paying the price for Columbian marching powder in the 80s 🙂 All the best for your recovery, Rick. Be well and take care 👍
I'm really happy to see you recovering well from the procedure. Lots of our viewers were worried about you. But I am soo relieve to see oyu back and hoping to see more from you here on your channel. Stay safe and healthy Rick!
The channel should go in whatever direction brings joy to you and those you love! If some of that joy spills over onto us, wonderful. Wishing you a speedy recovery.
Glad you're doing well Rick, and it's great you're up and about so soon afterwards. I had similar surgery for my aortic valve in 2019 but it was an arduous recovery that took way longer than a few days. I remember that heart pillow all too well! For me, music was the lifeline that helped me get through it, and I am sure it's the same for you.
Congrats on your successful surgery.  I had a quadruple bypass 5 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did.  Now that it has had 5 years to fade, my scar might not scare small children anymore.  All the best.
I'd like to see a focus on health and quality of life from a beato perspective.
Glad you got fixed up!
So glad you're doing great, Rick. I had a bypass operation in November. Recovery went great. Amazing how advanced medical science and surgical arts are.
Good to see you up and about Rick! I am amazed at what medical technology can do these days. Best wishes for a speedy continued recovery.
Glad you made it through. My wife had similar surgery years ago and she is great. Hopefully this will give you years of vitality.
I am close to your age Rick(57).  We are from the same musical era.  My mother raised me on Motown, Do-wop, Jan & Dean, the Beach Boys, Roy Orbison, and Elvis from birth. I didn't really catch up to my own era of rock til I was late teens.  Rick, you have changed the way I listen to music.  I love this channel.  I am beyond relieved you are well.  I wish you long life and fulfillment of all your goals.  I look forward to many more videos that educate in the truly universal language... music.
Glad the surgery went well Rick. Love your channel, big howdy from New Zealand.
I hope you continue to recover and feel well Rick. You do good work here. Still waiting for that Joni chat. Love and warm hugs from Ireland. Paul ❤️
Glad to hear that you're doing well, I would love to see more "what makes this song great" vids
Thank you Father God for protecting Rick and guiding the hands of the medical staff! Blessings to you and the family!
Glad yr doing well
You are one of my favorite Youtube channels!  Keep on going and take care of yourself !
Welcome to the Kardiac Klub!  Ain't modern medicine a marvel?
Jam on Beato...
Glad you are feeling better!
Detractors: "You just don't like new music, that's why you have heart problems." Agree or not your views, love your work. Truly indispensable.
Part time viewer...  Glad you are ok and would love for you to come back to Cleveland and meet you
All my best wishes to you Rick, thank you for all of the knowledge you have passed down through your videos! God bless you and your family Rick!
Had a heart sonogram and watching the valve flap started calculating how many times in my life that value had opened and closed. How many per minute, how many per hour, how many per day, how many per year, how many in all my years.  Compare that with a toilet valve and its mean time between failure and ... its just a miracle that any of us are alive! But the heart isn't an ordinary machine - its a machine that is constantly being rebuilt as cells replace other cells.  Its alive. The material in that current valve might not be more than a year old.  Its when the design goes amok that you die.
Great  News
Way to go Rick!!! You did this for yourself, for your family, for all of us, and -- I'll be the official spokesperson for everyone here -- we really appreciate it. I had this done in 2018 at age 67 and have been feeling basicly great ever since. It's one of those superb occasions when you get to reactivate your appreciation of life and decrease your likelihood of ever taking it for granted. Stay in shape, live consciously, keep on keepin' on, we're with you. Love.
Stay well stay safe, mr master of music stories 🎉
Get well slowly.  Do not overdue it..
Rick, best wishes on a speedy recovery.  Now the channel. I prefer more instruction,techniques and breakdowns over the interview heavy schedule.  But not so much so that I’ve stopped watching. I am your age but have always been mystified by trying to make music. I love to learn about it anyway because then I can talk to my son, the music major.
Glad to hear that you’re doing well!  Stay healthy!
So happy you are well and back Rick. Yeah, this world needs strong and talented people like you are! Keep on rocking! 🤘
Hey Rick, what did you think when they took the breathing tube out! LOL I thought that was the worst part of open heart surgery.
Very Happy you are well after your surgery!!
Sorry to hear this never suspected anything like that  the only thing I dare saying is about changing life style also. I turned  Vegetarian since 2012 Vegan and from 2020  Best regards from Italy
Stoked it went well bro❤
We're not done with you yet, Rick! Stay healthy! :)
Welcome up here Rick.  Clinic is the best place to go bro.  Love your stuff, get well  I've been a patient for 16 years, I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Also, really glad you got to see our museums.  The area is really nice.
have a good recovery! God bless! best wishes from Brazil
Quick and manageable recuperation process! Take care of your self!
Rick layoff lifting those heavy Les Paul's for a while. Speedy recovery.
Congrats and god bless
Hey Rick, I’m going through something similar just had a heart procedure myself, I’m 63 and love your channel so stay strong and give yourself time to heal up well brotha 👍🏿
Good news! What would we do without you, Rick? For me, keep the song breakdowns coming.
Get back in the saddle soon my friend godspeed
Glad you went to Cleveland Clinic rather than to Emory, as I know a few people who find Emory doctors not the best, let's say
take care of yourself, glad to know you're ok
Glad your ok man God bless you and all you do!!
It's good your better in yourself rick take care mate
Rick its good to know you are well and the ticker is in good shape.
You are a gem of a human being Rick. I suspect whether it was gardening, carpentry, cooking or accounting, you would bring the same passion, curiosity and insight to the table. But I'm immensely grateful your chosen subject is music. As for the future of the channel? Interviews, interviews and more interviews. Warmest wishes for a full recovery and many more years doing what you do so exceptionally. ❤
I have had heart problems ever since i was born. Had surgery 4 times. Bless these doctors. Glad you are recovering well rick.
Get well soon. Perhaps get a rocking chair out on the porch (if you have one?) and groove away.
Congrats on the successful surgery and recovery.  All the best going forward.
Sigue cuidandote. Abrazos desde Costa Rica.
So glad you are OK. Sending healing thoughts from a humid place.
Cheers for your health!
Wishing you well, take care Ricky.
Much love from New Zealand
glad your surgery was successful Rick. All the best!
All the best, Rick! These are wonderful news.
Wishing you a speedy and complete recovery and the very best of health for all the years to come Rick. We're with you in spirit if not in person!
Glad to see your video today
7-1/2 years ago, I was going in for stents , to find out they could not do it, I was to blocked. I ended up with a triple bypass. It took 5 months before I could handle the weight around my neck with my bass hanging off me. I’m in Canada and that would have been almost 500,000 in the USA, it didn’t cost me a dime out of pocket
Thank you for the update Rick, We wish you a full and speedy recovery. The music community loves and appreciates you, both musicians and music lovers!! Whether you are teaching, interviewing, breaking down a song(Wmtsg-my favorite), or just telling a story, you do it with passion. All the best, Salute!
I absolutely love the break down of songs that you do!
Rick, you look like you’re lost some weight.  It shows in your face.  Please take care of yourself.  We all want you to be healthy and be with us for a long time to come!! Blessings!!!!
Best wishes for a quick and complete recovery Rick.
Honestly, I enjoy your videos when you do things or cover certain topics by yourself without any special guests. Just you and some of your pals. Those videos are great also.
Hey Rick I had open heart surgery to repair my valve as well. I had regurgitation as well, I was in full congestive heart failure…. And I’m very lucky to be alive!!!  I was in the hospital for a month December 25 to January 25. Your channel kept me going. You’re so important to all of us, and what you’re doing is really important! Speedy recovery
It makes me so happy that you are well . I love your videos. 🙏
It’s great to see you back at it and in the swing of things.
And The Beato Goes On!   Keep on Rockin' Mr. B!
Glad to know you are ok.....saludos
All the best Rick! Do listen to the doctors and take it easy. We’ll cope without your vids for a while … I suppose … somehow 😢
Prayer to you, keep rocking!
Was any AI used during this procedure?
I'm so happy everything went well for you, Rick. I'm happy to still have you around.. I appreciate your channel. Thank you very much.
Congrats!  I'm 73 and was fine until a year ago I collapsed walking down the street (arrhythmia) and a had a heart block/stroke.  I've since had two ablations, a pacemaker implant (it doesn't do anything unless it gets really low), and hopefully a Watchman so I can get off the blood thinners.  Back cycling, hiking, and playing guitar! We're in an era between the "old days" when they gave you meds and told you to do nothing, and hopefully, a new era where they can actually fix some of these things.  Hope it keeps going!
Glad you’re doing well Rick!!! 👍
Rick has 4.35 M friends. Other channels have viewers.   Get well!
BTW Cleveland Clinic best in the world for Heart Care
Glad your good my friend!
You're a legend, Rick! Wish you the very best and accept a big hug from Portugal. Take care and keep it going man🙌👊
Happy to hear you're doing well 🤘🏽
What you're doing in your fantastic channel is historical documentation... history needs you Rick... Take care... 🙏
Rick, it's amazing to see how well you're doing! I'm 68, and appreciate your "organ recital," as we describe medical stories in my family :) Don't overdo, but do just enough, and know that your fans are endlessly appreciative of all you do ❤
Rick, So glad the surgery went well and thrilled to have you back!
Very happy to hear of your good health. I hope it persists forever!
Don't you go checkin' out on us. Glad you're   on the path to recovery. The world's a better place with you in it. 😊
yikes, get well!!!
Best wishes.
Rick so glad to see you're doing well! Rest up man. But not for too long. I need more lessons!
Wow..I'm a year older than you,  and I had nearly the same procedure,  the same time you did.
Glad you're okay.
Godspeed!
Good luck. Keep well!
Man I'm glad you got this fixed!  Leaky valve can lead to premature heart failure Looking forward to many more great videos and interviews now that you are fixed!!!
Pace yourself, and give the body the chance it needs to heal.  May your journey to recovery be a safe, uneventful and a comfortable one ❤
hmmmm... am scanning his guitar rack, eyeballing for <10 lb models.
Cheers to you and your health, Rick!  I have one burning desire to see from you:  An interview with Paul McCartney.   Why?  Because you would ask all the questions we fellow musicians would want to hear, verses crap like, "What was it like to be a Beatle. . . .  blah, blah, blah," like everyone else does. Don't know what it would to take for you or your staff to make this opportunity happen, but it would, without question, be the best interview with Paul ever conducted.
awesome news - go Rick
Good for you. Glad to hear the surgery went well. Follow the doctor's instructions. Your videos are so well done and informative. I look forward to many more years of them.
Glad you're doing well but don't scare us like that!
You look awesome for what you went through. Long may you run, Rick!
Glad to hear that you are feeling better.
Glad to hear the good news!
You're healthy - YAYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
Hey Rick. I'm glad you got that looked after. I really appreciate all your videos and I am looking forward to many more.
Awesome!
All the best with the recovery Rick. Hard to know how to improve the channel.  I love the interviews and frequently share them.  Song breakdowns are awesome too.  You have me practising E.T. at the moment!
So glad you’re doing well. Rock on Rick!
I'm happy you are alive and renewed. Long live and prosper🖖
Rest well. I actually have the same thing they told me one day I’ll need the identical procedure. But every year my diagnosis is the same lol
So glad you're doing ok, Rick. Your channel is the BEST music channel on YouTube - hands down!! Keep the beat....see what I did there? 😁
Love the interviews! I would love to see more what makes a song great.  I like when you break them down and point out things I didn't know was there , for example the foo fighters everlong. I've been listening to that song from the day it was released but it wasn't until you broke it down did I know there was a woman singing in it. Blew my mind. I love this channel! Keep up the great work!  And I'm so happy you everything went well and that you are doing fine! 🤘❤
Glad you're doing well Rick. But can from the UK who loves your outlook on music
I've walked around Cleveland Clinic and went to museums in between tests as well
glad u are cured
Take care Rick.
I’m in my 50’s and have the same problem but it’s not severe. Having said despite all my achievements in life I’ve been called lazy throughout my life as I ran out of battery too fast and do not have lots of energy like my peers. I have always curious to know how much of it it’s my condition and how much of it it’s me. So perhaps you can answer that question and tell me if you feel more energetic after surgery.
I’m glad that you made it through your surgery and feeling better. I don’t know if you’ve had sessions on recording because I haven’t seen all your videos. But maybe you could give some ideas on some less expensive recording gear and how to get started recording your originals. Thank you.
So your doc told you that you couldn't play a Les Paul for 5 weeks?  Best wishes.   GWS.
Great news Rick. A 62-year service on your heart sounds like a good idea. Long may you keep that great heart in your work, we love it. All the best.
I'm glad everything went so well. ❤
Glad that everything went fine, Rick. So keep on rocking.
Welcome back. Glad you're okay. I hope you can do more 'What makes this song great' vids. Stay healthy.
I had a heart problem when I was born. It was a congenital heart defect. I had to close up a little hole. I had my sternum opened up to cover the little hole in my heart. Glad to know you are OK Rick Beato.
So glad your doing well!!
Take care of yourself Rick. Wishing you a speedy recovery
I just want to see whatever you want to make and show us. Be well 🙏
Stay strong brother, and keep up the great work.
So glad the surgery was successful!
Good to see you up and about Rick! Speedy recovery!
We care about you Rick . When are you going to interview some power metal artist
I have regurgitating heart valves too (3 or 4), so very interested.  Thank you for this video.  Love your interviews (watched Dave Natale maybe 4 times?) - there are alot of song breakdown videos & fewer good interview videos.  Stay well.
I am glad things went well and am wishing you a speedy recovery.
get well, bro!
2 years since my heart surgery.  I'm not sure I was able to do what you are doing a week later.  My daughter got married 2 weeks after the surgery and even limiting my activity and involvement, I was WIPED long before the party ended. Kudos to you and your surgeon.
Glad to hear you’re recovering Rick!
Glad you are okay Rick ❤
❣
So pleased that you are well!  Best of luck and welcome to the world of cardiological rehabilitation. 8 )
We luv yah Rick ☺️ glad your feeling better..🤔someone said nation treasure... As Stallone would say in Rocky.." Absolutely" !.. 🙏🌄✌️😌..
Dang! Rick ! Stay well!!
Glad you came to Ohio to get yourself all fixed up and repaired, Clevland Clinic is top notch really glad things went well for you, now you play on for another 62 years!!
Rick, you look great, sound great and in fact after getting to know you through your channel here, I conclude that you are GREAT!   I too am having heart issues after experiencing central chest pains. A CAT scan revealed furring of arteries. My Doctor has informed me of the results and has suggested some medications. I am currently doing some online research as to whether statins are required as there are varying opinions regarding their need and efficacy. Beterblockers were mentioned too. I have made an appointment with a cardiac nurse to discuss my findings further. 🙏❤️😊
Glad to hear you're on the mend! Here's to you continuing to recover. All the best 'cause you're the best!
Well, great to hear the good news, Rick! My younger brother, who is a professional guitarist in Nashville, had to have a leaky heart valve replaced last year, and was doing well too, until a recent car wreck. He is on the road to recovery once again!
Glad your on the mend 🙏
As Jackson sang..My Cleveland Heart. Glad you are well
Glad you're healing well.  Hope you're enjoying every day.
I would love more WMTSG episodes.. Stay healthy!!
Take care and get ever better.
So glad you are doing well. Your interviews are AMAZING!!!!!
All this means you're meant to be around a while longer. 🙏💕🐈
Good to see you are feeling better and everything went well! Looking forward to more interviews and pretty much everything you do.
Heal quickly Rick! I'm a couple years younger and had double bypass 3 years ago.. been there done that! (With a bit more recovery time needed) Just genetics, not anymore over weight than you. Glad you're fixed up and doing well.
Keep keeping on is my latest song
Rick. I'm glad you are recovering well.
Long live, Rock’n’rolla!)
Glad to see you back!
God bless you, Rick. I wish you a fast and full recovery.
Stay well and wishing you the best.
I worked in Heart and Vascular research at The Clinic.  Yep, they're top notch.  Glad you're feeling better!
My mom has had two open heart surgeries so I understand..she is doing great
Keep on keeping on sir
Dear Rickalmost since the beginnig of tour channel I follow you. Thank you for everything you do. I wish you health and peace. You will have good and long live as tou give us so much. Our love is with you! Then..  the music will rejuvenate you! Greetings from Pola d!
🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋👏👏👏👏👏👏
glad you are okay!
It is generous of you to share this personal information.  As a doctor (retired) I know way too much about what you have just been through.  Your upbeat (pun) reaction is as iconic as your musicology.  Earlier today I found your work on Willow.  That sent me down a delightful Willow rabbit hole, where I encountered a whole bunch of “Rick Beats sent me here” messages, and having listened to her talk about her music creating I think you should interview her.
I'm grateful you're back up and at 'em! Keep healthy Rick! I suggest doing more guitar theory videos coming from someone who is passively attempting to teach myself guitar based on what theory I already know. You have a very calming demeaner and I think following along with any lessons you'd make public here would be a tremendous help! Take care!
Yay! Glad you're ok!!  Cleveland Clinic rocks!!
Hope you're doing good 😊
Prayers brotha! You rock!!!
Glad you're back in the saddle again, Rick!
Wow Rick glad you are hanging in there.  I understand partially  what you are going through.    At 28 years old I had a bunch of cardiac arrhythmias and was diagnosed with a prolapsed mitral valve (MVP).  My valve does not close properly and can ‘leak’ but I have all kinds of cardiac symptoms.    At first it scared me.  I’m 70 now.  It has been a life altering condition.    Thoughts and prayers with you Rick!
Glad you are doing well!  As to video ideas, how about taking a musical concept and showing examples of songs that do that, whatever it is?
all the best!
Speedy recovery,  Rick
Heal up, Rick!!!
I am a Clevelander and a long fan of this channel. Here's to a speedy recovery!
Glad to hear you are doing well !
Hey Mr Beato! All my best most sincere wishes for perfect recovery, hoping you're soon healthy as a horse. TAKE IT EASY! TAKE YOUR TIME! Apart from all what I suppose you're going to have to do on a daily basis to keep yourself at the peak of your health (recommended cardio, etc..), just think of reducing whatever else that may involve stress and efforts to the minimum of what's necessary to achieve your goals ... Think ECONOMY of stress and efforts! With mental organization and self-discipline, that will allow to "do the same" or even maybe "do more", with less stress and less efforts. Enjoy your family and friends! We're all still there,we won't let you down! And we'll still keep on loving what you produce.  God bless you, and your family and friends!
you're looking good rick. it's gret to have you back.
Do whatever you feel a passion to do.  Based on what you’ve put out over the years, that seems to be what you’ve done. And that’s worked out great for all of us.
Glad to hear the operation went well!
So glad you're on the mend 🙂
Great to see you're on the mend and charging forward.
🙏❤️🙏
Glad you are back. Love the channel.
Congratulations Rick , glad to see your on the mend. Look at it as a 100,000 mile service, God be with you and your family. PEACE AND LOVE TO EVERYONE ❤❤.
Be well, Rick!
Subtract 100 years: 1924. The first successful transplant of a human organ: 1954 ( it was a kidney). Your parents had absolutely no real recourse with a problem like yours. Now? They go in, clean up, zip up and done. You're out after f**** open heart surgery within days! I'm only a bit younger than you, but the both of us may well live to see SYNTHETIC organ replacement. Congratulations on sailing through what is still, nonetheless, a major procedure. I spent 9 hours in surgery to have a squamous cell carcinoma removed from the bottom right side of my tongue. 9 hours. Three of the days in ICU. They "harvested" a bit of my left forearm to replace what they carved out. They took a vein which from the same forearm which they said I "didn't 'need'." I had an NGT, and a tracheostomy just to be safe (big choking hazard with this set of procedures, apparently). While my heart wasn't 'stopped', the 9 hours under anesthesia had me unable to breathe on my own after - vague recollection of being spoken to, by the nurse "You need to remember to breathe. Start taking some breaths...". Terrifying, to say the least. But, here we are, back in the game. Wonders of modern medicine. Stay well, sir.❤
Rick I am so glad you are doing well and on the mend.  I have enjoyed your videos for years and especially loved your "What Makes This Song Great" episodes.  You are such an incredibly gifted musician and wonderful teacher.  You have a personable friendly interview style and though it is obvious your knowledge level is vast and you have mad skills, you never come across as pretentious.  Such a generous spirit is rare.  You are truly the gift that keeps on giving.
Please look up the book The Sinatra Solution: Metabolic Cardiology. This book introduces you to using D-ribos, L-carnitine and Ubiquinol to strengthen your heart. Please ask you doctor if this could be a natural way to help with energy levels. My Mother died of heart faliure in 2020 and I found this in my research. Her doctors would not let her try anything natural and she just slowly got worse tell she passed. She was 76 and she also had a surgery simular to your with the Mitral Valve. I will pray for you that you can return to good health soon. Your videos have ment so much to me. I have told at least 300 people about and or showed them your channels. Take care my friend.
Stay well, Rick!
I've had heart problems for as long as I can remember. Stay strong!
All the best to you Rick, from Montevideo, Uruguay.
Glad to you're hear you're recovering well Rick!
I had a mitral vale repair 14 years ago - my ticker is still ticking.  I know what that surgery is like, and the recovery.  Thinking of you, hang in there, get regular checkups - echos, stress tests.  All the best
So happy your feeling better!!
Glad to know it went all well.   Another 62 years of music videos ahead! :)
Stay healthy Rick.  I've enjoyed a lot of the different things you've put out there, so I imagine that whichever direction you go this year, it will be the same.
I was going to wish you a speedy recovery, but it looks like it's already happened hahahaaaa.  All the best to you sir.
Glad you are on the mend and on the way towards a 100% recovery!   Hang in there!
love the interviews the best but love all of your videos
I AM curious and will remain so. Just keep doing what interests and excites you...we'll be right there with you, Rick.
♥♥
Best wishes and quick healing.
Hey Rick - OHS Class of 2018 checking in. Mine was the aortic valve which needed replacing and I also needed to repair an ascending aortic aneurysm. But having also joined the "9-Inch scar" club and seeing you in this video, your recovery is nothing short of miraculous. It took me nearly a full month to be able to walk just 1 mile. You look and sound fantastic. So glad to see you on the mend! Keep up the great work here on your channels - but don't push your recovery too hard. If you need a minute every now and again, take it. (Also 62 btw)
"dead tired" 🤔 Ooofffaa Thankfully you were only just "tired" 😏 Glad to see ya doing well RB 👍 God Bless ✌️
Congrats on your surgery. Live long!
God bless you, Rick! So glad you’re on the mend and so grateful to the surgeons and medical professionals that dedicate their lives to healing! I love all your content, but am not a musician. I especially appreciate the interviews and what makes this song great. But ultimately it’s you that we’re here to treasure. Keep rockin’ on!❤
Willing you full health and recovery! Live long and rock on!
So happy to hear that your recovery has been so fast and without a lot of pain. I have an inherited genetic mutation (LMNA-DCM). I was in heart failure until last month, and I feel you and the tiredness from MR. Last month I was fortunate enough to get a heart transplant and have the same open heart surgery restrictions.  Your channel over  the years has inspired me to keep up with music in all forms and so happy that we'll be able to do this for many more. All the best
I'm thankful you had a successful surgery, Rick! As a 62 year-old heart patient myself, I can truly relate. I wish you continued health and JOY moving forward! As for content on your channel, I wouldn't change anything! As an "Amplifier Junkie," maybe you could tell us more about your favorite Amplifiers & their particular applications, but that's my only suggestion. Just keep up the great work, man! All of us here truly appreciate what you do! 🎸🎸
Ahhh stop Rick! You know your heart stopped when you heard me increase my chops, or was it the wrong notes?? Hmmmm
You’re some man Rick. Channel is fantastic. Personally I would love to see more what makes this song great episodes. The interviews have been amazing though.
So happy for you Rick. You look great. I am from Ohio and the Cleveland Clinic is a source of regional pride..As well as The Cramps and Devo. 😄
Glad to hear that procedure went well.
Glad your OK !
Glad your fixed up and you can continue to do this awesome channel!
Wishing the best recovery possible 🙂👍🙂
Just keep making the videos Rick. We'll watch whatever content you provide ✌️❤️👍
Glad to hear you're on the mend!
When it comes to stories like this I always say that is it awesome to be living in the future!
Ruck, my musical skills are pretty low. I'm a hobby player.   Still, I enjoy and even cherish what I learn watching your videos.   Also, as crazy as I know it sounds, after watching your videos so long, I feel like I know you. (I realize I don't)   Because of my crazy sense of feeling I know you, and how much I enjoy what I get from your videos, I'm glad you're okay.   Take care of yourself.
Have been down virtually the same path. Be well. Take care. Stay safe. God Bless.
I'm glad you're operation was successful
All the best  for a full recovery/resolution!!
For 62 you look at least 10 years younger so your doing something right🤟
More top 20 lists.
God bless you, Rick, be well.
Great to hear that your procedure was a success!!!
Glad you're well!
Rick I want a guitar any guitar, I play guitar, but it would mean a lot to have something from you.
I'm glad you are OK. Interviews like Keith Jarret and George Benson solidify your Legend status. Your contribution to world music is very necessary and will be around for a long long time
All the best strong man, be safe and sound
Rick, glad you went to The CLE for treatment. Best hospital in the world, especially for heart. As for your channel, I love everything you do, but your interviews are worthy of a place in the Smithsonian. Your interviews with stars, session players, producers and all others involved in the music world have provided a valuable history of Rock and Roll and other musical art forms (blues, soul) through the lens of the people who were there. Not many interviewers can do this with as much intelligence and background knowledge as you. The musicians talk to you like you are one of them, because you ARE one of them. Keep doing those! Every interview is a gift!
Just take care of yourself.  Take it easy for awhile and recovery properly.  I enjoy all your wisdom and enthusiasm. Be well.
Glad you are ok!
Great to hear that you're doing well and I'm confident you have a lot of more beats ahead of you! Keep on rocking!
Welcome to the zipper club!
Great!! Congratulations!! No vest? I got an artificial heart valve seven years ago, and I had to wear a thorax vest for six weeks to keep my chest together. They said it was very important.  Take care!!
Wish you all the best, Rick. Thank you for a wonderful Channel Rich of information and inspiration.
OUTSTANDING!  Glad you had a...favorable patient outcome  You know what would make a great video topic?   A breakdown of Jackson Browne's tune *Cleveland Heart*
Rick , I’m so glad everything was successful and I wish you a speedy recovery and great health going forward.. best wishes Cam 🎸🎸🎸
You sound great. Glad for such a speedy recovery.
nice to hear you are well. geçmiş olsun..
you're a hero rick. speedy recovery!
Dear Rick, thank you for being
I'm glad you're ok Rick. We need you around for a long time. Take care
Love you!
Stay strong and keep rocking Rick!🤘⚡️
Get well soon from Ireland .... 🙂
I went through open heart surgery, and I could barely function for weeks. I couldn't even lift myself out of bed- had to have help. You are pretty amazing, man.
Wow amazngi speed of healing! Good job.
Thank you for the update.  I'm happy to hear that you got the treatment you needed.  I wish you a full and speedy recovery!
Be well!!!
All the best with your recovery Rick. I'm in recovery mode myself after a big back op in march, my third (I'll be eighty yo soon). Take tour time! I've been lurking in the background of your vlog for many years now and I'd like you to continue for many years to come. BTW, less interviews more analisys and music, please. 🙂 Cheers...
F yeah! Zipper club baby! Welcome to the club.
I'm extremely happy for you, Rick! You are a true inspiration. I'm so happy for all your success - you are brilliant!
Rick you're the best! I'm a Boston guy and I know you grew up in the New York area so I feel at home when you talk on these videos. Anyway, speedy recovery and I can't wait for more vids. Ty!
VERY best on your complete recovery and continued good health. Sugar and carbs will kill you.
So glad you are doing well, Rick. Much love to you, my friend.   Thoughts on the channel: I love the interviews. Hearing behind the scenes stories from rock stars and the unsung heroes of the recording industry is more fascinating than I would have ever thought. Your Michael Beinhorn interview really sucked me in. The rapport you have with the interviewee's is palpable. I started watching for the amazing song breakdowns, like most folks, and I would love more of those as well. Your trips down memory lane, either talking about your family or bands you've recorded or played with are also really interesting. Honestly, Rick, I can't think of any of your content that I haven't enjoyed. So go where your fancy takes you. I'll be along for the ride. 🙂
Rick that is very encouraging. I am 67 and facing a triple bypass in a couple of months. Similar story to yours. I am encouraged to hear that it made such a difference. Keep Rocking!
the Cleveland Clinic is the world best when it comes to the heart
Glad to hear things went ok man - take it easy and hope things continue to go well for you.
Congratulations on your successful surgery. We have something in common, I have dealing with a regurgitating mitral valve for 16 years and am still asymptomatic. Three weeks ago....Same line, "eventually you will need surgery".  Apparently my "murmur" is "severe", my condition is not. I will have another echo in 2 weeks.. we'll see what that says.  Again, congrats and best wishes. Can't imagine life without your wonderful presentations. Educational and inspiring. .
Glad your operation was successful Rick and that you feel well - wonderful news and long live you! Cheers ZN
So great to hear, Rick! ❤  You looked happy and well in your hospital picture!  Great to have you back and feeling good!!!
Get well Rick, I had open heart ,just don’t rush things. Good to hear your recovering well.
Take care, we all appreciate what you've done, and continue to do, for music.
Wishing you a full and speedy recovery Rick!
Glad to see you healthy.
Glad to see you back and recovered, Rick! Can't wait for your coming videos. Stay safe!
Thank God you're OK and back.  Just no heavy metal for a while. God Bless You!
Very happy you are well Rick...Party on.
So thankful you recovered well. Love you Rick!!
Hey Rick! Glad you’re feeling better! 👣🌎☮️♥️🎶
Thank you, easy does it recovering nicely 😊
Love from Scotland
Glad you’re ok. Stay well!
Glad everything went well Rick!
So you’re saying you had no rhythm?!?! Great to hear it went well. Keep on keepin’ on!! You’re the best!
So happy to hear you are doing well ❤
What in hell does this have to do with music??
You look great! Hope your health continues to improve.
Congrats for choosing the Cleveland Clinic, universally regarded as the best heart hospital in the world.  I’m 68 and I have the same heart condition that you had but I only live 10 miles from the Cleveland Clinic so I feel very fortunate.
❤
Glad that you are okay.  Prayers for a full recovery.
Rick I have been watching your videos for some time now and really enjoy your work. I had no idea this was going on. Speedy recovery :O)
I had a heart attack a year ago. You get through it...or you die. :)
God bless Rick Beato! ❤
Wishing you the best, Rick!
All the best Rick!  You went to see the foremost experts at CC!  Good to see you up and around already!
Glad everything worked out good, Rick!
Love the channel, following few years now, miss what makes this song great.
Hernia surgery here last thursday, im watching you and playin my acoustic guitar. Sometimes we have to ( join the club♿) for a couple of days.  You look great, brother, take care Rick.
Great to hear your doing well !
So glad that it went well for you, Rick! Heal up fast!
I’m glad to hear you’re feeling better. It’s good to see you up and around and as far as the channel goes, I think you’re doing a great job! Keep it!
Really gald you are feeling fine.
Take care brother!! <3
Well, the interviews have been fascinating, so if that is the shape of things to come, I am perfectly fine with it. Wish you the best of health! From Quebec, Canada.
Near-62 -year-old here, Rick, heart attack and three stents in my LAD last year and I can tell you that you are going to be great, you are fixed, repaired, good to go. I have every ounce of energy and singing/playing ability I had when I was young and you will, too. Rejoice! Please keep cranking out these awesome videos and keep getting better, my friend. You'll be in our thoughts.
Rooting for you, buddy...
welcome back trooper
glad you are ok
Welcome to the Zipper Club! ❤‍🩹
👍👍👍
Awesome ! So glad you're doing well sir. I had my aortic valve replaced six months ago. Do absolutely everything they told you to, exactly how they told you to, and you'll heal quick and fully. Keep your cough pillow handy as much as you can, and especially for sneezing. Your sternum healing is what takes longest, and the source of discomfort from time to time as it heals. Good luck, and great to see you doing well. Take care.  Tylenol for the pain, no Ibuprofen, sleep on your back if you can, don't forget to take the blood thinners / aspirin if they told you to, and don't drink too much fluids for now. Rootin' for you.
I blame Spotify.
I like everything you do on this channel so…do what you feel (think that’s a lyric).  Glad you are on the mend!
Love you Rick
Great to hear you've come through your surgery so well, Rick. I'm a cardiologist, but not specialising in valves. However sounds like they hit the perfect Goldilocks timing for you - operated not too early but not too late. Credit to you for sharing your health story. Helps others. Love the channel (though definately more expert on hearts than music)
So glad your feeling better!!  Personally for me I have been loving the interviews!! So I’d vote for more of them ! Thsnks
Damn Rick!!  Long Time Subscriber/Fan!  Get Well!  I just had quadruple bypass surgery in April.  Part of my recovery was watching your videos!!!  Love my scar!  :)
Join the club great hospital
Glad you’re doing so well!  I also want to thank you for sharing as I am about your age and have a similar issue that you had.  I suspect I have a similar surgery in my future.
I'm 71 and had a triple bypass a few years back. After my surgery, I lost the taste for beer. Loved it before, didn't care for it after whatsoever. Night and day change. I still think that was strange.
You look like you've lost a little weight. Don't fade away on us!🤜🤛 The interviews are amazing. We are entering a time filled with a lot of Rock n Roll musicians deaths as everyone from the 60s 70s and 80s start hitting their 70s, 80s, and 90s, so it is important to preserve the real stories behind the making of their greatest songs for history.
How about s9me analysis of instrument usage and tech changes over the decades....B3s of the 60s, rhodes of the 70s, dx7 and 808 in the 80s, along with guitar and Amp choices leading into the tech of today!
Glad to hear it went well Rick! No more than 10 lbs? So you can't play a Les Paul then ... 😄
Relieved to hear things went well. I can't imagine what was going through your mind before the surgery with having young children. I would be a mess! Glad you're back! ✌
Scary times Rick.  Very glad you're going strong!    Congratulations to you and the medical team.
Prayers for continued healing and many decades of joy ahead!
God bless you,  Rick, and so glad the surgery was such a success and you are BACK!  Looking forward to more awesome videos and your unique perspective on everything music.
what happened  buddy Please change your diet
I had no idea you had this condition Rick, but I'm really pleased that you have had it mended so successfully and that you are able to keep working. I never knew how much I didn't know about music until I came across you and your channel a couple of years ago! Now I know a lot more and can appreciate what goes in to making music much more, all down to you. A big thank you for sharing your knowledge so expertly, and long may you continue to do so. You are the gold standard Rick!
Glad to hear everything is fine Rick, keep up the great work!
Takk!
God bless ❤
We love you Rick and all you do!
Good thing your signature LP is under 10 lbs!!! Speedy recovery Rick! We all love ya man!
Love you Rick Love all the stuff you do!  Keep going sir Long live Rick Beato
Glad you're good to go Rick! Love the channel!
Good to see you ok. Get well.
Rick, so glad you're okay!  I've been watching your channel from very near the beginning, and yours is the best in all of music-related YouTube.  Wherever you go from here, we'll follow.
Love you Rick, went though a similar procedure 3 years ago. Aortic value repacement. Chose a bovine valve. I had my surgery done by Doctors James Wu, Chief of Cardiac Surgery at Lehigh Valley Medical Center in Pennsylvania. He did a " J-cut" incision that after my chest hair grew back, no one can tell I had any surgery without looking very close. So that's my recommendation for others on your channel. I know every situation is different, but thought I had to share. Stay well, stay strong. Its obvious you're a fine man.
Glory to God! We love you Rick!  Have Peter Cetera on. ‘love those singing bass players, you were that for a time in your journey.
Glad that the surgery went well. We need you healthy ;)
Be well rick ! Happy you are feeling better.
It would be easy to make jokes about today’s bad music making us all sick, but I’ll refrain from more of my usual stupid remarks. I just want to express my gratitude for all you do. I have no talent for music but it’s been a lifelong love and I learn so much from your videos. Thank you Rick. You’re a blessing.
Simply look after yourself Rick. That's the only thing you need to do. Best wishes from Ireland ☘️❤👍
Sir may you be healthy. All the best!
Glad you’re doing great Rick!!!  Was one of your staff doctors by any chance “Dr Robert”?  He did already for the Beatles.
Life is very strange.... I'm glad to see you back mate :)
Get better soon! We need you.
Had the same 5 years ago.  Now that the valve is fixed, expect your energy to be better than in previous years.  Love the song/music education you provide and how you do it.  Welcome back to the party, pal.
Prayers and good thoughts your way Rick!
Glad you are back Rick!!  Take it easy and go slow buddy.
Glad to have you back fully operational :) Go easy though
Get in the box Rick! Two minutes for looking so good 👍!
Pfffff this former heavyweight boxer and black belt karateka would be so fucking scared….I have to be honest here… I’m happy you’re doing well.
Love you, Rick! My mum had the exact same surgery in the 1950s and never had any problems with it since. I hope you're lifting 10 lbs weights again soon.
Happy to hear you are doing better. Your channel is so great. Best wishes and prayers.
Refua Shelema
Up here in Seattle all us musicians talk about you as if we know you personally. LOVE the videos and im really happy your surgery went so well!
All the best, Rick
Love, light & healing energy coming your way Rick!  ❤️🙏🏽🙌🏽
Glad you are recovering well.
Cars have valves too ,, Car Dee All o gists 👶🙏🧚‍♀️🎸👶🙏🧚‍♀️🎻
Best of luck in your recovery. I had this same operation almost a year ago, and yes it's an eye opener to realize you've needed open heart surgery. All the best
Deus abençoe sua recuperação!
Great to see you back Rick! ⚡🤘🏽🎸
Well done, man... well done! Get well soon!
Rick I am delighted to see you are recovering well! I am a pianist and composer of your age who grew up listening to the same music as you. I love your videos and your critical open-mindedness. Please stay well and keep up the good work! 💛
Good to hear you're healthy and back at it! I think you should try something a bit different with the direction of the channel. I have an idea: You could go check out some foreign  alternative rock music. For example you could check out some Danish albums by bands like Kashmir, Tim Christensen or Mew,  and then make a video for each country you musically visit. This way you can make a new series of videos. I think you would love the album Honeyburst by Tim Christensen, since he is a massive beatles fan (he even beat Noel Gallagher in a beatles competetion, haha) and you can really hear where he got the inspiration from. Cheers Rick!
Speedy recovery Rick!!
I hope your recovery is fast.
See? stop getting angry about modern music, bad to your health XD... But beside the joke, get well soon!
Glad to hear that everything was successful.  Praying that you continue to watch your health and that God keeps you healthy & happy.  🙏
The interviews over the last year or so have been first class. Nuno and Bud O’Brien were my faves. I’d love an interview with anyone from Phish.
You look amazing after a week post-op. It really is profound to think about the whole process.
We get older and music gets shitter
Glad you got it taking care of Rick.
Yes, all of the people involved in modern medical technology (Doctors, nurses, other medical professionals, the engineers and many other people who made the technology possible) are a true blessing!  I'm happy that you're able to return to your family and to us!
Carnae trabeculae (sp) ...translates as "little beams and rafters", roughly. Going back many years to gross anatomy. These are the little "strings" that keep your valves from blowing back, or, through to prevent a "murmur".  I have one. I've, also, a dilated ascending aorta. I get where you're at. I hope you are ok, Mr. Beato. I enjoy your videos very much.
Glad you're ok
Get well soon Rick.
Severe regurgitation is also a symptom suffered by contemporary pop music
Interviews are great!
Happy you're well!
We love you, Rick! 🎸
Rick, wishing you good health!!!! As far as possible topics, could you deep dive some Humble Pie songs! They are my favorite band of all time, but they are barely mentioned in the current era.
Wishing you luck on your recovery.
glad your good
This is hart to see. Yesterday an Austrian Youtuber (very good content (KSK kochen)) Said he cantz post anymore Videos because of a Surgery...so is it true do we get older and get these old ppl problems ? (i am 54 no surgery in progress) So i hope you get well soon.
Be well my brother, love you.
10 lbs?  So, no Gibson LPs.  Lol!
ATB.  Peace Love Harmony.
you look great ! happy to see that
☮️💜
Rick, thank goodness you made it through the surgery with flying colors!!!! I had no idea. Sending you gentle cyber hugs. Please take whatever time you need to recover. Your audience isn't going anywhere.   I enjoy all of your content so please, who cares, whatever you want to do and talk about with YOUR life will be fine with me! 💗💗💗💗💗
Stay healthy Rick!
We're almost exactly the same age Rick, and different health probs, but same basic deal - you hit your 60s, and 'someday you'll have to deal w/ it' becomes 'next week is surgery'.  On the other hand - beats the hell out of the alternative, and very happy to hear you're recovering fantastically.
I love everything you do. Interviews and song breakdowns both.
So glad to see you fit and well, Rick.  Going in to have open heart surgery must have been an anxious time.  I can't imagine what must have been going through your mind as you were being anaesthetised.  Anyway, once again, I am so pleased to see you all fit and well. Love you and your show.
Glad you are doing well! Thank you for sharing your story. Cleveland Clinic is amazing. They saved my mom's life. Hope you have another 50+ years living life and making music.
Hey Rick Let me assure you, Sir: you CAN play the guitar!❤
rick your unstoppable 🔋🔋🔋
Long life Rick <3
WOW! That's amazing, you look so good for having survived that surgery only a week ago. You're one tough mother 🙂
Dang you look good for someone who had open chest Rick, reminds me of me px who was playing pickleball 1 week after
🙌🏼❤️‍🔥🙌🏼
Rick, we are all glad you're doing well!
Keep on rocking
All the best. You are amazing.
Great news Rick and look after yourself.
Happy your healing quickly.
Happy to hear you're okay.
Sorry, Rick.  From these 4000 impassioned comments posted in two hours, I can see no one gives a damn.  Oh, well.  😎
Glad you’re healthy Rick!  As far as content goes, follow your heart (pun semi-intended). You’ve earned the right to do what you enjoy most. I don’t think anyone will be disappointed.
So happy you are doing  great! My wife just had open heart surgery 3 weeks ago at NYU Langone in  NYcity for hyperthropic Cardiomyopathy and like you, she is doing fantastic! Love your inteviews! Hope you can interview the great Boz Scaggs someday! God bless you Rick!
Rick glad your your Okay brother
.y Dad always says 'Keep the shiny side up!'
All the best Rick ! Take care mate 🙏
Love to see you back. Here in Canada you'd have to wait three months to see a doctor and another three years for surgery, that is, if you were still around to have it.
So glad for your full recovery, you look great! Greetings from Spain!
So glad all was successful, you really add that special sauce to our lives, thank you, and may you heal well and quickly.
Confirms that Beato talked Biden out of running because Biden couldn’t remember major pentatonic scales
You are a legend. I love the what makes this song great series and also the top 10 lists and things like that maybe you can expand to more genres like “top 10 horn intros of all time” or “top 10 highest notes sung in rock”
Glad to hear it went well Rick. My Dad had open heart surgery recently at 75 for an aneurism close to bursting in his ascending aorta. He’s fine now thankfully. Take care on your continued recovery.
Rick, you're the best! I hope your back on your feet soon!
Rick's new theme songs: A Hard Day's Night, followed by Getting Better and I Feel Fine.
Glad to see you're doing well.  Stay strong and keep rocking
Glad to hear you are on the mend, Rick. I had an aortic valve replacement surgery done in 2017, my recovery took a little longer. I was on a heart and lung machine and all went well accept one little thing. I didn't have much feeling in my left arm and hand, and little control. The possibility of not being able to play guitar kinda freaked me out, but there was enough control to feed myself, a slow and Shakey process because my right arm had the IV drip and something else I can't remember so I couldn't use it. A couple of days later feeling came back as well as full mobility in my hand. I think it was 2 days before they allowed me to sit up with assistance and another day to stand a couple minutes again assisted. Next day take a few steps, I can do more, "no back to bed". Was weird hearing my heartbeat, then I got used to it and don't notice it now.
Glad you're doing well, Rick!
Loving the interviews 👍👍❤️
So glad it all went well.
Wonderful to hear about your recovery. We love you, Rick!
...And many moooore! 🎉
Speedy recovery Rick! Glad it all went well and hope you'll have a wonderful time recovering. Take all the time you need!!  I had a big one last year and felt so grateful for all the people who operated/treated me, even those who would have just done one small task in the passing. It's perhaps just their job, but these people change lives and deserve so much praise.
One of my close relatives has gone through it and the decision was right not to play with fire anymore at some older age. Complete recovery. Good for you too! We're happy to see you again and again!
We love you, Rick! We’re grateful for you and glad you’re healthy.
Rick,good to see you doing well. Thank you for your contribution to Music
Get well soon 👍
Bless your heart Rick🙏
Wow.  Had no idea… glad it was successful and you’re on the mend
So glad that you are ok .. Whatever you put on your channel is greatly appreciated by me
Fitting that you had that done at the home of the Rock and Roll hall of fame. 😊
Glad you're ok Rick!
Good to know you have recovered so quickly Rick.
Great to see you up and running!
so glad you hear you are going to be aok! We need you around for many, many, MANY more years!
Prayers for your recovery. God Bless.
💪🫀🎸🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💜
Best wishes!
Glad you are doing well. I’d like to see a What makes this song great Country music version. You’ve done plenty of rock, but classic and modern country has plenty of songs complex and simple to dive into.
Rick I'm sending you my blessings. Hope you fully recover soon. May you put your trust in Jesus Christ, the original and only ROCK.
Damn Rick, we getting old.  Grats on the cardiac success!  Im a survivor of CABG x4
So glad that you are doing well!  Love your musical knowledge, fabulous guitar playing and your excellent interviews...
It's great to see you again - out of the hospital
These are the days of miracle and wonder ...
Glad you’re doing better! Didn’t see initial post but noticed channel was quiet last week. Wishing you the best of luck and good health ahead!
Lay off the Les Pauls for a couple of weeks, Rick.  I'm super happy to hear that your operation was successful and relatively painless!
Glad you are on the mend!
Get well soon!
hope you are well 👍
Happy to see you well!  Loving thoughts your way!
Rick, did you ask the Cardiac Surgeon "will I be able to play the piano after this?"  😄😄  Best wishes from your followers in Oz.
Hey Rick you're a trooper ... sending "health" prayers your way ... "keep on, keepin' on!"
Bravo! Great news all around!
Get well Rick B. Your channel is great! Love the song breakdowns!
Glad to to hear, all went well.
I was afraid to click the video.  I'm happy that you're ok man, love your rick!
Prayers for you Rick!! Speedy recovery and may God bless you! 🙏  BTW, love your guitar lessons! 👍👍😊
Glad you're feeling better.
I am very happy for your successful outcome. Modern medicine is a marvel. Let's all work to be sure every American can have access to all the medical services they need at an affordable cost. No one should go bankrupt due to a health crisis.
Rick, love your videos, love your sincerely speech here, wish you all the best!
I had the same thing.
Hi Rick, I am 61 and have exact same condition found out last year. I talked to cardiologist that does clip procedure and have appointment with chief surgeon about open heart procedure on Wednesday. Told me that surgery could next week or so. Guess leaning toward open heart fix my regurgitation. Hope won’t hinder me from my drums. Glad you’re doing good.
Sorry to hear you went through this. I have zero complains about your channel just keep doing what you’re doing. Much love
Great to hear, Rick!
Heal up well Rick and here's to a very long, healthy and happy life!
I had mitral valve replaced with a mechanical valve in 2003. One side of my heart grew. I am supposed to have died 10 years ago. Still here just clicking along.
I'm just glad that everything went well for you.  Stay healthy, and above all else, stay "IN" as much trouble as you possibly can.  Take care.
🙏🙏🙏🎸
Thank God you’re ok. I’ll be praying for you.
Looking great Rick- out of traction and back in action.
Rick you are the best. So thankful everything went well.  Keep on truckin
Very happy to hear you are not only doing well but that you have been under medical advice for as long as you have. Thom FHS '66
I'm so glad to hear that you are doing well after your surgery. I was worried about you.
I knew something was wrong for the last couple months and when you're attitude became a struggling fighting attitude
Hey Rick, kinda new to your channel. Great content. I'm your age, well ,a  little older, 64. My two older brother musicians  turned me on to the Beatles at a very young age (5). Anything the Beatles put on an album they could play i live. That goes for a lot of groups in those days. I'm happy you point out   some the really fake music some no talent people are putting out nowadays. Anyways, glad to hear your ok, and doing well. Stay Blessed.
Keep on keeping on Rick. Wish you the best.
What about a video series on what makes this equipment/instrument great???
Thank's for sharing. Means a lot to me. Have also a heart condition.
Congratulations on your successful surgery! Keep doing interviews with legacy musicians while YOU and they are with us.
Welcome back man!
Happy your are doing so well Rick! 😊
The sheer level of excellence that all your interviews have showcased is amazing. The roster was outstanding. I love watching them (Nuno was my favorite) and I’ll occasionally do a rewatch as well. If you kept those going, amazing. The song breakdowns were always great as well. What if you did something similar, more long format for whole albums? The choice would have to make sense of course, but maybe diving into the producers, engineers, studio, etc. Also, there are some smaller channels that do mix/song reviews. Submissions from viewers, and they usually take a small donation. Now, I know your channel is massive (4.5m 🤯), but there might be a way to make that work. Just some ideas. Continue the speedy recovery! 🫶🏼
You probably gave yourself another 40 years easily. Take care of yourself. Thanks for the great videos.
I am glad to see that everything goes well with your medical operation so we can watch you many, many years in the future. Be well.
Great your surgery went well and your recovery keep well looking fwd to years more of the very best music content around , all the best
Happy your are doing so well Rick! 😊
Rick, So glad to hear your surgery went well and your feeling better.
Happy to know surgery went well and you’re fully recovered! And that you can continue sharing with us ALL THAT MUSIC IN YOUR HEART!!! 😁
We love you, Rick! Glad you're recovering so well!
No old Les Pauls for you!
Hi Rick. May God continue to bless you with good health and great videos!!☮️
Love you Rick. I had cryoablation for AVNRT a few years ago. My heart rate used to go up to 260bpm at gigs when my arrhythmia kicked in. All good now. Heart surgery is really scary, but it’s amazing what they can do now. So glad you’re ok.
Gott sei dank. Die Möglichkeiten der heutigen Medizin  sind schon beeindruckend. Ich wünsche mir nein uns allen noch viele Videos von dir. Ganz "herzliche " Grüße aus Deutschland
Congrats!
God bless, man.  Take care of yourself.  Life's kind of worth sticking around for.  So glad you have good docs.
4k comments in 3 hour!  What's that tell you?  Godspeed,  Mr. Beato!
... needless to ask you to get well soon - but get well soon, Rick 🙂
Rick thanks for the wonderful update and its great to know that everything went well.
Your color already looks better.  Keep at it!
Good to hear you're on the mend. Re future possibilities: A few youtubers have responded to your recent critique of contemporary music 'creators.' One human repeatedly took your comments out of context and made assumptions to suite his retort. This amounted to a gross mischaracterization of your perspective. As such, are you inclined to revisit this topic... one more time? In one of your videos, you named a few genuinely talented musicians, but I wonder if your point can be made stronger by highlighting musicians in the moment. I'm thinking about "Strangers" by Portishead Live at Roseland. Notwithstanding instrument chops, how many 'musicians' who rely on computers for the bulk of their sound, wield the skill and creativity to write, arrange, and play something like "Strangers." Most would have no idea where to begin.
Best wishes Rick, I had a quad bypass in the spring of 2013, I was 60. I'll be 72 in a couple three months. Modern medicine is miraculous. Stay the course. I look forward to your videos continuing for a long, long time.
You look great, I hope you continue to feel fine. How nice to know we can have some more time together. Keep going and teaching, I'll keep watching and learning.
Get well soon!  I loved your interview with Keith Jarrett.  I am a huge fan of both of you, and I memorized part of the Koln Concert long ago and perform it often at my piano job.  I also have a heart condition and I discovered that if you take daily selenium tablets it is very good for you.  Do some research on that.
Prayers for a speedy recovery!
Hey man! WOW. Glad you're OK!! Love your channels!
Glad to see you looking very Well.Keep ot that way
things like this really put your life in perspective and refresh your life goals!!  Glad the surgery went well!!  I hope you continue with the channel as you have helped me and im sure many others to better appreciate music!!!
You're a treasure, Rick. Thank goodness you're on the mend.
Thanks for sharing. Had a TAVR put in my aorta but that was minimal in comparison. We love all the things you do. Just keep doing what you are passionate about and you’ll continue to grow.
And the beat goes on...far, out thanks for the lessons and knowledge .
Hoping you have a healthy recovery. I'm glad you got it it repaired before it got any worse.
Get well very soon Rick!❤
More song break downs pls Rick, especially more Radiohead!
Wishing you a speedy recovery. Being through this myself the most difficult part is not lifting.
Prayers work!  I'm glad you are doing OK.  I went in for my 5th back surgery on August 31 last year, and when they put me under anesthesia, my heart rate dropped under 30, and they couldn't get it back up.  Back surgery was canceled, and I got a pacemaker the next day.  I didn't know I had a heart problem at all.  I'm feeling great now and had the back surgery in November.  I really enjoy all of your videos, so whichever way the channel goes, I will follow.
Watched this video with interest as I was also diagnosed with mild to moderate mitral valve regurgitation three years ago.  The procedure that you have undergone may be in my future if this progresses so I am encouraged by the positive outcome of your experience. Thankyou for sharing and for your awesome channel.
Thank you for the update! I love back stories from the musicians, about instruments, and why they have chosen what they have to play. I'm the same age as you, so your musical interests, as varied as they are, are mine, too.
Glad you're back Rick. Stay healthy.
I would love to see more song breakdowns (early Genesis especially!!!) Really glad you are doing well!! I love what you do Rick!
Glad to see this post , best wishes Rick , you look and sound great .
Glad you're recovering well Rick 💜 all the best
Congrats . Stay well .
Rick, good vibrations are in you and that's why you don't have any major problems and I wish you happiness in your heart and mind every day.🙂
Been there....mine was an aortic aneurysm.  Cut out the bad...replace with the new. Amazing what they can do these days...and yeah...have the zipper scare as well. Hated having to sleep on my back for 2 months. Glad it went well and to have you back.
Glad to hear things went well and you're not feeling any ill effects so far.   Hope things go smoothly and there are no complications.
It's good to be alive isn't it? I wish I had such easy resolution to my health problems which have no real diagnosis, but I get tired VERY easily have brain fog etc. BUT, I'm still here at 65 and so are you, which is good.
Love you, Rick. You're the best. <3
I'm really glad to know that you are great and I wish you a quick recovery! Best wishes from Brazil.
You are a wiser man than I. I think I have something going on. I know I should get it checked out, but part doesn't want to know. Maybe your story I'll make a different choice. Thanks for sharing and glad you're doing well.
Surgery is heavy brother, make sure your emotional status is covered.  Hot Damn!
Best wishes to you, Rick. Interviews are probably my favorite feature of your channel so if you're counting votes, there's one for interviews.
Stay well Rick. Hope you make a full recovery with many more video's to come.
Take care of yourself, Rick. Hope you heal and recover super fast. So glad to hear that you are doing well. We need you and your music knowledge. Your interviews are really special, keep up the good work. 🤟🏻🎸
Just keep doing what you do. I'm so glad you are doing well. Blessings
Hey Rick - happy you are OK. Thank you for your music and insight. Stay well
So glad to hear your report of a successful surgery, and that you are feeling much better. You and I are the same age Rick. I had to have a double bypass in July of 2018 after a heart attack. Now I recently found out that my bicuspid valve isn't closing shut at the end of the beat. It's causing fluid to build up in my stomach. I have an upcoming appointment with a cardiologist, and I'm wondering if I will need surgery to resolve this issue. Anyway, thank God you're still strong and grooving right along. I've been a subscriber for quite some time, if I'm not mistaken since before you reached one million. I tell everyone about your channel. Looking forward to the next video my friend. Until then, cheers!
Happy to hear you're doing so well!!
So GLAD you’re doing well mate, wish you all the best - I also think your musician interviews are the best in the business, compared to radio hosts, MTV, podcasters, no one does it better.  Cheers mate 🍻
Rick, Thank you for everything you do on the channel.  I wish you a complete and swift recovery.
I'm very happy that you are recovering well Rick, you are a World treasure, much love and good vibes to you
i find it amazing that folsk like yourself can hear a note and tell what it is. to me it is a sound!
They thought I had pneumonia, my Aortic valve was completely shut.  Healing the ribs is the worst freaking part.
Hi Rick - I also had open heart surgery in December and the recovery does indeed seem fast.  I had a heart attack and woke up being loaded into an ambulance.  The only pain I had was from CPR cracking my ribs - that took about 6 weeks.  I agree that there is otherwise zero pain.  If you are offered cardio rehab, take it!  It really helped speed up my recovery.  Now, 7 months later, I’m feeling great and feel like I have a new lease on life.  Keep it up!!!
Your channel is great and you are a treasure!!  So glad you had such a successful surgery and are mending quickly.  Your interviews are amazing but thoroughly enjoy your song analysis too- in other words it's all a treat!
Please take care of yourself. Eat your vegetables. We need you.
Godspeed Rick! So glad you're doing great! Keep on rocking!
Happy to see you're doing well!
Very glad you're doing well. Thanks for the update.
God bless you. Prayers bud!
So glad you had a successful surgery and are feeling well. Welcome back.
So happy to hear of your quick recovery and prays for your continued health.  As far as your channel, everything you do is enjoyable and edifying, please don't stop but your interviews have become the best part for me.  It is apparent your guests appreciate being interviewed by someone with your musical understanding and relatability. ♥♥
Bless you Rick so glad your ok  your a  Star just love your channel   just love Real Music Its The Best.🎸🎸 best  wishes 🎹🎺🎻🪕🎷🎶🎵🎼
I like the interview stuff. Keep it up, please. Get well soon.
Rick you’re an international treasure. Thanks for your work. Stay strong.
You were looking pretty gray there for a while.  Your color looks so much better Rick.
God is so faithful!!  Glad to hear you're healing well.  You have been a tremendous blessing to a lot of people.  Don't ever forget that, brother.
Very happy for you Rick. “Live long and prosper “
Much Love and Blessings to you Rick Beato!! The Music World was Positively Influenced/Changed by Your Contributions and,... ... So Very Happy for Your Continued Recovery!!
Great to see you up and getting better, Rick. Keep inspiring all of us!
Glad you are ok Rick
Great to hear!!! Looking forward to many more years of great content
Congrat's on your speedy recovery !! I had a double CABG (bypass) 10 years ago - that was not fun. I'd rather play guitar. Thanks for all you do, and I hope you keep the variety of musical content for a long time to come.
Take care of yourself. You make Atlanta proud!
Hey Rick once you're back to 100% and ready to do some some breakdowns can we get some Corrosion of Conformity ?     I'm thinking maybe Pearls before Swine or Broken man or one of their least known songs.   Celebration Song is also a good one.     Glad the Surg went well.
So glad all went well & you are well along the road to recovery.
Glad all is well.
Hi Rick. I've been through exactly the same surgery. Open thorax in order to implant an artificial aortic valve, St. Jud 25, I believe they called it. Before the operation I asked the surgeon, what if I don't get it. There is always a risk. At that time about 5 percent didn't survive the first 3 days. "You'll have about ten years left then. And the last years won't be pleasant," he said. That was nearly 15 years ago. Today, I am 72 years old, feeling absolutely fine and enjoying life and still playing in a good jazz band. So you have many years to go! Good luck and greetings from Denmark!
I'm happy to hear that you're ok.😊
Wishing you continued good health! To answer your question, I vote for more interviews. You're really good at getting interesting stories from interesting people.
I can do a lesson on severe modes Rick😅 Just having a laugh So glad your healing well God bless brother
So happy that everything was very successful.  You look great!
Praying for your complete recovery Rick!
Brother, you scared me!!! I hope you are doing well and may God bless you and your family. So happy procedure went well. Thank you for your phenomenal content!!!
Remarkable medical journey. It appears you are in good hands and are a good patient for your Docs. We are happy to get you back in good heart health. Rock on Rick 🤘🏽
One idea would be to find bands or musicians making great music now -- like "great" by your own definition -- stuff that could have competed with prog rock in the 70s. Is anybody doing ANYTHING interesting and also has some pizzazz and stage presence?
glad you are ok Rick ,keep on !
Thanks for sharing Rick. I'm about to have aortic valve replacement. This is really positive news. Best of health to you sir.
Wow!  Best wishes for a good recovery, Rick!
Youre an inspiration Rick!
Glad it went well!!! We need you Rick!!!
Wow, Rick -- you are amazing. And when I think of when my parents had that surgury (my dad in 1990 and my mom in 2000) and the weeks of time they spent in the hospital afterward... technology and science moves on!!! All the best! You are the reason I went back to the guitar after 30 years and man, it has changed my life (at 67 years old -- it's NEVER too late to go back and do the things you love!) . Love the RB book too -- wish I had it back when I was 15! All the best for continued health!
Long life to Rick and the amazing job and contribution to those who love music.
Great news Rick.   Love your videos and hope to see more soon.
So glad your surgery went well, heal well and God bless! 😉
Feel good man, feel good!
Glad you are feeling well! I love the interviews you do, by far the best around!
Glad You're doing well after surgery Rick!!We Love You!!!God Bless You!!!
Wow Rick! All the very best wishes being sent your way!
Keep on trucking.
Very good to see you sir.💪🏾
Long live Rick Beato so glad you are doing great ❤
Keep on Ricking, Rock ! 😘 Reste encore ici quelques décennies pour faire profiter les musiciens du monde entier de tes multiples talents, et de cette sagesse sublimée par des années d'expérience ! Love from France 🤩
Be well...
❤!! All the best Rick!
evrything you do is great...love all of it. stay well ..jdp
You're looking fantastic Rick, take no prisoners!! It's funny, they knock you out, then you're waking up... Life is the BEST! 😊🙂
✨️🛟
I posted this on your last video as well, but I'm here in Utah and I send my mitral repair patients to Cleveland Clinic.  Good choice!  Dr Gillinov is amazing.  He has actually called me on my personal phone late at night once to give an update on a patient that I sent to him that I didn't even remember was there!  That's going beyond.  Keep on keepin' on!
I'm glad you're feeling much better Rick. Someone that loves Rush as much as you do deserves to live to 100.
Glad your surgery went well. Happy your back doing life again.
All good.  Just don’t pick up any 1970s Les Pauls.
I’m glad you’re doing well. I’ve just started watching but really appreciate your perspective and talent. I’d say take requests on deep dives on songs?
Wishing you all the best with your recovery, Rick! Thank you for what you do for music education.
Speedy recovery Rick, this is my go to channel! Such a fan of what you are doing. You are building a legacy and a body of work that will be around for years and years for future musicians to delve into your lessons and to discover the artists and the songs you analyse.  From Jazz melodic flow to film scoring to breaking down Donna Lee to interviewing Keith Jarrett, every musician should be tuning in here !!! Love it man thank you J
Rick -- Glad you are doing so well. It was great to see you in this video so soon after your surgery.
Your so amazing love your channels
Wow, I heard about this, thought I'd like to send a get well card, but it's too late! You're already well soon!! Great to see it Rick. Congrats to you and your incredible medical staff.
Glad you're doing well.
Get well soon fellah. Had a big ol heart attack at 38 and still going at 54 :) swim a kilometre (thank god we’re not imperial here) and can slog jog 5 km. just keep going and delighted you’re well.
Great to hear you're doing good! The interviews are awesome!
Alles Gute!
Top man .
Thanks for the update! I'm glad the surgery went so smoothly!
Wishing you a swift recovery. You're a gem.❤
Glad you're mending quickly, Rick
Glad you are doing well!😊😊😊
So happy , we need you here … great news !!!
Thank God Your procedure was successful
Glad you are back. We need you.
Wow, it’s hard to believe you had open heart surgery only a week ago. So glad it went well!
My mom, dad and my best friend ever had similar surgery. Do as the doctors say. Lifting stuff like guitars... be careful.
Yay Rick, glad you're alll good!!!
Rick..first off, very best wishes for your recovery-you seem to be doing incredibly well so far. This was an amazing video to see, as I’m on a waiting list( a 73 year old drummer ) for the same procedure here in the UK, and seeing and hearing you describe the exact same symptoms and looking and sounding so well has done so much to allay my fears and apprehension. Thank you.
Рик, поправляйся друг. Не болей. Крепкого тебе  здоровья и долгих лет жизни.   Stay hard with rock! 🤘
Heal up fast Rick! Best wishes
I had a heart transplant at CCF 25 years ago. That heart took me all over the world and gave me chance for a future. Then 3 years ago I had a second heart transplant at Cedars Sinai in LA. Glad you are on the mend. It's pretty amazing how well the human body can deal with that amount of trauma and how they make you get up and walk immediately!
Wishing you all the best, Rick.
I’m glad to hear you’re doing okay Rick! I love your channel and I’ve been watching your stuff for years now xx
Sending you love from Australia :)
My mom had this done except her entire mitral valve was replaced.  The reason why the doctor made Rick wait for his surgery is, they don’t want to perform the surgery more than once due to its riskiness.  These valves last maybe 15 years if you’re lucky.  So they wait as long as possible before putting someone in extreme danger, hoping to only have to do this surgery on someone once.  Next time they perform it, it should be less invasive and they can enter through the leg or side rib to replace or repair a valve.
You're great,  Rick! Always great to listen to your brilliant posts.... You went through some serious surgery,  man!! All my blessings and good luck! Take very good care of your heart❤❤🎉
Rock on!
Glad to see you're doing well
Thought they could replace it authoroscope
🖖🏻
~~~ Healing Vibes to you Rick )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
I'm glad you're feeling better.  I'm a couple of years younger than you and I'm having a procedure in 3 weeks.  I'm looking forward to feeling better.
Good to hear.. Your surgery went well....
Glad the op went well, Rick. Happy to hear you are on the mend. Best wishes
Good luck. Lotta people have heart problems that they aren't aware of .Glad you got this taken care of. Great videos by the way!!!
So glad to hear it went so well. I’m2 years past my major surgery so I feel ya. What should you do now? You do so many things well. The interviews are phenomenal. The analysis is wonderful it’s so educational so it’s difficult to say. What do you like to do? Who are you trying to serve?iis it a mix of serving the public educationally are doing what you find interesting? Finding that balance? If I were to vote, I would say I want Rick to do things that he does best ,which in my opinion are the interviews because the depth of knowledge and experience that you bring to these interviews is really unique.
Glad you are feeling fine Rick!
Glad it went well! Stay heathy
so glad to hear youre doing so well!!
Don’t change a thing !!! So glad you’re feeling better!!!
Happy for you boss!!! Keep up the good work, for defining to us what quality music is and how its made 🎉
I'm glad you are feeling better all the best to you and yours....
Feel better Beato.
You look great RIck, nobody would guess that you had heart surgery just a week ago.  All the best, love your channel.
Just keep doing whatever you want to do and I'll keep watching. Finding that thing in life that gives you joy is precious and I hope you'll continue to do that (whatever it is) for many more years.
All the best, you are amazing.
Thank you for sharing your med story. I am 78-9 and symptomatically alike. My doc is having me, tomorrow  in to for a stress test and blood work up. Were NOT talking 2-p5 yrrs. I suspect sooner but we'll waite and  see.  Thanks for sharing. O' I am a amateur guitarist and have been playing sense I was 17. Your advanced tex talks  and vids have been a great help in improving my acoustic abilities. Be good to yourself!
So happy to hear you are doing well! A new lease on life. As far as the channel goes, if it ain't broke... Although I would like to see more breakdowns. Love ya, man.
I love the whiteboards. I love the breakdowns.
Glad you're well 👍
Stay on this side of the lawn - please
I wish you all the best!!
I’m glad they were able to fix it Rick!❤
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻
I love the interviews so please continue with those, but I originally found your channel from the "What makes this song great" series
God bless Rick! ❤
Hey Rick! I love you, man. I also work in healthcare. Glad that you got what you needed and it worked so well. I want you around teaching us about music for a long, long time to come.
hey Rick, I've been follower of yours for a couple of years now, but I'm very low profile. But this time I can't hold myself from posting a comment, I saw your post on instagram and got a bit worried, but I am really glad that you are well, man.😃 ps. I miss "what makes this song great" series
"They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating And from what I've seen I believe 'em Now the old boy may be barely breathing But the heart of rock and roll, heart of rock and roll is still beating".... 💝
Wishing you perfect healing from another Cleveland Clinic alumn.
Great to have you back and best wished for a full recovery. Looking forward to song breakdowns with a few from the 50's and 60's from songwriters like Randazzo or Mann-Weil. Singers back then didn't pass go unless they had a lot of talent.
Kudos to everybody who gave good, loving comments to Rick. I especially like the one that said he is a national treasure - because he is!
Rick, your fans and followers love you and wish you a speedy recovery.
God bless you Rick, glad the surgery went well, that’s really good to hear 😊 get well soon!!
How about songs about the ❤️!
Glad to hear everything went well!
Hi Rick, glad you're doing well after the surgery, take care of yourself man, you're a great person! 👍❤️
Rick, wishing you a speedy recovery. Stay healthy, and I look forward to more great videos from you.
You are in the zippers and slippers club, I've been in it for 11yrs 😊
Glad you are doing well sir! Not sure if you had a valve prolapse or it just finally thickened to the point of not functioning properly, but I am glad they were able to do the fix quickly. Gillinov is well-known in medical circles. Fortunate.
Great to see you looking so well Rick . Keep getting better every day. Sean
Rick you should be resting still..film yourself while lying down ...😊 bro if you need a nurse..I'll fly to the states...
Wishing you the very best.
Praise God, Mr. Rick! Thank you for all you do. Personally, I would like to see more of what makes this song great, again. Cheers, from Florida.
Praying for you Rick. Get well soon!
I would LOVE more of those videos where you and other musicians reimagine guitar solos like what you did with "Stairway to Heaven."  That was amazing.  I know that sort of thing is probably an incredible amount of work with recording the backing track on your own and such, but it was so cool.  Regardless, look forward to whatever you create on the channel.  Best wishes.
Great news, I was hoping for news, most gratifying that you're doing so well Sir!        As to suggestions for the channel, some more explorations of guitar idiom modal sonic territories like the Lydian upon E would be good. (For what it's worth, I look into my crystal ball and I see the future's kids getting right on down to The Lydian as a major key alongside the Ionian and Mixolydian)..            Much appreciate the good news! 🎶🌟👍
Good to see you up and well
You were in Cleveland?? I'm from this area in Aurora,Ohio....Did you visit the Rock Hall???...Next time you come up, let's have lunch! I have a lot of stories of the rock scene in Cleveland during the 60's & 70's....
Great news dude!
Get well soon Rick…
All the best, Rick!
It's fantastic to see you doing so well - and so soon after open heart surgery. It's incredible what medicine can do today. Take it easy and keep improving!
Great news you're doing well Rick.  Keep on keeping on!
I'd like to see a video of you eating a big bowl of pasta. You're looking a little thin. 😁 Glad to see you bouncing back so quickly and well ❤
Get well
Wishing you the best Rick, I appreciate you and I'm glad your procedure went okay! Thanks for all you do.
That is wonderful such a fast recovery!  My mother (78 this july 27th) is still in the intensive care room for same surgery that took place July 3rd. Actualy, after numerous falls starts, she finaly was able to stand up today July 22th with assistance. Your story gives us even more power to beleive in her full recovery soon.  Take good care of yourself Sir. I really enjoy following your chanel!  Best regards, Normand (Montréal area)
Glad that the surgery went well! On the subject of health, I really appreciated Kenny Aronoff’s insights into injury prevention and general healthy habits. Perhaps this could be a topic in more videos in the future. Whatever you do, I’ll be watching!
God bless Rick!!!
We are all grateful you passed the surgery with flying colors. Your channel, and Ted Gioia as well are the reason I decided to  get more serious with music, clearly my tastes aren't aligning with modern trends (the same could be said since I was a kid, but hey), so I just want the tools to better analyze the music I love, but it's been thanks to your channel that I finally realized that: not just consume, but learn and understand
I’m so pleased that you had a very successful surgery and are feeling as well as you are now! I am a total classical music aficionado who grew up in the 60s, and therefore was right there in LA from the moment the Beatles showed up at the Hollywood Bowl, through the tsunami of folk and rock brilliance (so much from the UK), we could hardly keep up with! Thank you for your magnificent teaching, with your broad spectrum of deep appreciation for rock, jazz and classical, great interviews, intense air guitar and theory teaching. YouTube knew that I would love your work, subscribe and be totally hooked!🎶❤️
Gosh, Rick, I'm so glad you came through the surgery okay. Here's hoping you heal up well and do this channel for 20 more years, or more.
Good to see you're well Rick. Welcome back!
So glad you are well, Rick.
Glad to see you're up and about, Rick.  I had triple bypass 10 years ago, so I have a pretty good idea of what you're going through.  One recommendation:  Get to the gym (if you're not already).  As many times a week as you can.  Cardio and resistance.  Four years after my surgery, I asked my cardiologist why I felt so normal.  He asked me 'Are you still going to the gym?'  I answered 'Yes'.  And he said 'That's why'.
Great to hear you are doing well Rick.  All the best!
Fantastic news to learn you have taken care of this issue and you are now doing well, Rick!
Wishing you great health and happiness.
I discovered your channel only this year when I was intrigued to see your interview with one of my faves, Pat Metheny! Many amazing interviews later, I have grown to just love what you do here. I'm 55 and a retired punk rock drummer who recently learned that I have a congenital mitral valve issue that causes regurgitation similar to what you described here. I've been avoiding the cardiologist out of raw fear of the surgery or outcome, but you are giving me the courage to get my ass back at the doctor's stat. Much love to you Rick!
Take care of yourself Rick.
Im glad your surgery turned out well Rick. You are a good guy and deserve the very best ~!~
Med beds coming you might not need surgery! And ascension symptoms of tired ness along with your healing process..wishing you well love & light keep strumming 🎶
Prayers for your complete recovery, Rick
Bext wishes to you, Rick!
Thanks  for  the  update  Rick. Please  take  it  easy  and  recover  safely  with  GOD's  help. All  my  best  to  you.
Glad to see it it all worked out!❤
Glad your doing well Rick!
Rick, I'm so glad you finally got this taken care of.  Please don't f--- with your health, Brother.
Glad you are feeling good and surgery was a success. Would like more song breakdowns on the channel. Take care
Thrilled to see you're recovering Rick.ROCK ON!
Great news!
Best wishes to you, Rick. We're all in this together and all fighting the same battles. Now, give us some great new interviews!! George Lynch, Eric Johnson again...
You're a good guy rick.......all the best...onwards and upwards.....  keep on rockin!!!!!!
Thank you so much for sharing. I’m a big fan although not an accomplished musician. I have a passion for music that I see in your videos and I appreciate you and I’m glad you’re OK. I too have a valve condition that will need to be addressed at some point in the futureand watching your video seems serendipitous. Thank you for all you do. You’re the guy.
So glad you’re feeling better. Enjoy your channel immensely. Stay well
Glad to hear your surgery was a success. Keep going! @rickbeato- You are such an inspiration. I think your content is fantastic,  varied, educational, great interviews, and down to earth fun. I look forward to your videos and tell all of my musician friends (young and older) to subscribe. Thanks  🥂
great to hear tyou are well brother!!!
Please interview Bruce Cockburn and/or dissect one of his tunes. Maybe "Last Night of the World" etc. Glad you are doing well!
Dang, I get so tired of these YouTubers who complain about having their heart stopped and their chest cracked open.  Stop being such a whiny baby……   God bless you sir.  I love your channel.  We are the same age.  You have tons more talent than me, but I have fewer scars.  Wishing you all the best.
Glad your heart surgery went well, and you are on the mend, Rick! Whatever content you decide to put up, I will greatly enjoy and find your content informative as always.
Glad to see you are on the mend !
what an amazing time we live in: - I love watching your videos, despite I am dumb when it comes to music; I can't even play a single instrument - I'm so glad that you are here with us and creating these videos - I can watch your videos over the internet, no matter that an ocean sits between us. - An open heart surgery is "not a big deal", you are back after that operation in a few days, wow - I can write to you and express my gratitude without risking that my letter might get lost in the ocean :)
Rick,  Take care!  And really enjoy the in-depth interviews.  The Christopher Cross interview was Amazing…!
❤❤❤🎶🎸🎶🎸🎶🎸🎶❤️❤️❤️ I agree with comments to cool down on the Spotify Top 10s, just for sanity's sake. Make BEATO Spotify Top 10s!
Nine miles is a lot. I'm almost 70 and walk a hilly 3 miles a day....sometimes 5 when going to a local park. You look like you are doing well. I'm sure you're glad to get this behind you.
Wow.  What a surprise.  Glad all went well and that you're okay. 👍🏻 🙏🏻❗️
We are thanking you forever for your Great service to the music community!! From the bottom of our Heart we gonna list some songs with the keyword "Heart" : 1 - Un-Break my Heart - Toni Braxton 2 - Hungry Heart - Bruce Springsteen 3 - Dont go Break my Heart - Elton John with keke Dee 4 - Owner of a Lonely Heart - Yes 5 - Take these Chains From my Heart - Ray Charles  with love to you Rick Beato!!!!! Legends lives Forever!!!!!
Glad to see you are going  get better.
Glad you are doing great. Love your videos. Gotta keep your ticker ticking for another 20-30-40 years.
Rick. You am glad you had a successful surgery. You for suggestions for future topics. I believe a topic area could be reviewing the evolution the technology of various instruments and recording.  You touch on this is past videos and perhaps you can make it a series. Keep up the great programming
Stay healthy, Rick! The world needs you!
Stay well Rick!
Really glad you are ok!
Mind-boggling times we live in for this kind of surgery to be rather routine… Best wishes to you Rick, for a speedy recovery!
I hope you keep getting well Maestro Rick. We love you and appreciate all the knowledge about music you are sharing with all of us. 💪🏾🎸.
get well.
My father had same operation a few motnths ago! Best of recoverys!!!
You're doing amazing, congrats!
The Clinic CT surgeons rock!!  And the Expensive Care Unit nurses are the best. 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 I try to watch their medicine review lectures every two years and have probably seen your surgeons on one or more of those lectures.
God Bless you Rick! my wife has had open heart surgery as well, glad you are doing fine now
Best of luck Rick.
I live here in CLE and The Clinic is World Class. So glad you had a great experience here, Rick. I know you are in  the best of doctors’ care.   Stay well and come back and see us again under different circumstances!!
Whatever you do on your channel is always great!  I'm glad you listened to your doctors.  Your telling of the story is important for us older geezers who need to start thinking about our hearts (and other things.)  Thanks for all you do!
10 lb limit. So no Les Paul’s!!!
Glad you got good care Rick. You're one special dude!
Cheers to your continued health and success Rick!
Glad to see you back Rick!
atta way my brother!
Great news Rick.  Thanks for sharing.  Your experience might help someone else who might not recognize an issue and put off seeing a Doctor.
Under the U.S. health system??? Must have cost a bomb.
Great to hear that you are on the mend Rick! To a full recovery so you can  continue to teach us the mysteries of the beloved fretboard! Much respect!
Take care, Rick. Wishing you all the best.

Rick make of the channel what makes your heart feel good! Thank you for all the content you provide, and I wish you a full and complete recovery.
Rick great job I'm day 634 Aortic valve replacement and one graft. Back cycling nearly 100 mi /wk when work allows.  Really enjoy the vids.  Just a guy like you  ONE DAY AT A TIME.
God Bless you brother. 🎸🙏
So Glad your procedure was so effortlessly successful. I agree with john. You are a national treasure. You have given so much pleasure to us through your amazing understanding and experience, interviews and you simply being your sort of music geeky, music loving, wanting to make modern music better - self. I would not have wanted to live without your channels over the past years. Thank you for being here on this planet at this time!
Glad your alright rick! Have you ever invited ray davies by to have a chat. He may not be doing much these days, but that would be neat for him to drop by to strum a few tunes?
Take care 👍💯🖖
Glad you're feeling better, Rick!
Love ya Rick!
Thank you for sharing.  Glad you're doing better.
So glad your doing well Rick you look great would never know you just had heart surgery. Don’t feel pressured about posting videos on YouTube we will all still be here when you’re ready. You’re the man 👍✌️.
pretty amazing
So happy this was so successful and you had great care. Good health going forward and fast healing
Hi Rick, I’ve had 2 open heart surgeries myself and am happy to hear your operation and recovery has been going so well. Your videos inspire me and I am proud to share this experience with you. It really is a life changing event. Wishing you the best ❤️
Amazing great surgery story… I have my own… and more to come at 70…  Your Breakdown videos are incredible Rick… love to see a wider spectrum of music …Loreena McKinnit …Anoushka Shankar…Zakir Hussein ?
As stated, your are special, please take care of yourself looking forward. to following you for many many more years
Better to do this younger, rather than older. Happy that it went well!
So glad that you are okay Rick! I wish you all the best. Love from Canada brother!
Thanks for sharing this update, I enjoy your channel, cheers!
long life rick. thanks for sharing.
Glad everything went well for you
wishing you a good recovery and all the best "
Glad to see you are feeling good.
Had my mitral replaced 15 years ago. It’s an amazing journey.  God bless and be sure to do what your dr tells you.
Getting old is not easy. But it is a great privilege. Thank God for modern medicine. I have no suggestions on the future of your channel. Today’s music is in a very strange place. But let’s follow it together.❤
Glad you are well Rick and recovering rapidly. God Bless 🙏
Did the doctor say how long until you can start shaking your fist and yelling at clouds again? Seriously though, I'm glad you're doing well and I hope your recovery goes smoothly. My father had an emergency quadruple bypass a few years ago. It's amazing what good surgeons can do!
Thank you for all the inspiration, sir! Love from Poland
take your time to heal properly, please.💗💗💗💗
love you man xxxx
Glad it went so very well. Congratulations. Godspeed.
So glad you recovered so well and so rapidly!

sooooooo great Rick
Get well soon!
Get well Rick, wishing you the best
glad to hear you're doing well, keep rockin' Rick!
On watch alert myself. More lessons. Lessons seem easy for us, however on your end probably a splice and dice affair. Glad your normal again and this makes your gratitude elevate I am sure.
We love you Rick here in Ennis, the banner county, West Ireland..❤ glad your ok
Glad you're doing well.
Have a great recovery Ricky. We love you.
Happy healthy times Rick. Thank you 🤟🏾
Great to know you are fit and well Rick! Very best wishes from Dave in the UK.
I hope your recovery continues to go well
love hearing great news!
Thank you for sharing Rick. I'm glad you've been on top of your health and took care of business. Love you man!
God bless ❤
Its amazing how Youtube gave Rick a new career at 55+, and now the out-pouring of love after heart surgery💪 This shows the positive aspect of Social Media👍
So thankful everything went well. God Bless
glad they caught it early
Dude! Stoked that things went smooth. Glad we will have you round for a long time to come. Keep your health in check everyone... Also, keep up with the brilliant interviews, the deep dives in the music theory, thoughtful convos about the industry and perhaps more new bands that have that special sauce, would love to see you showcase them.... maybe some live studio performances??? Best music channel on youtube. Love to you Rick.
Cheers to you Rick!
Great to hear that your surgery was successful!
I'm glad you got through it well. It's amazing you aren't in more pain. Now... Some crazy Taylor Swift or Billie Eilish fan, that is also a Voodoo Priestess, put a curse on you for dissing new 'music'. I agree with you, but please don't tell anyone my name...
I've been with you since the beginning.  You're like a friend.   Wishing you a speedy continued recovery.
Best wishes, Rick.
Cleveland clinic is the best. Arnold Schwartznegger had heart surgery there a few weeks ago. And dignitaries from around the world go there for heart procedures. Have a quick recovery
You are an international treasure, Rick! Be well and take it easy for the next few weeks.
This is incredible news, Rick! Thanks for letting us know 🙂👍
Glad to see you up and about. Remember to rest when you need to and get back to 100% soon.
Sending get well wishes ❤️‍🩹🙏🏻
You are true inspiration, Rick! Thank you for being such true, good, an outstanding person you are! All the best for your health and also the best wishes for continuing your magnificent channel. You are teaching us all how to love music and care about passion you're living by spreading and sharing it for all around you with smile an joy. Peace, love, Bach, and jazz, (funk, metal and all other as well) ✌️🤟
So glad you are well and recovering! LOVE the interviews! Song breakdowns are great, more jazz please! Or take on the entire Dark Side of the Moon.
👍
Wishing you great health Rick!
Praying for you Rick.  Cleveland Clinic did my aortic surgery and it was great.   They are the best.
Love you so much Rick
Glad you're still kickin.
Get jellyfish back together and give some love to the band brad
❤❤❤
International Treasure!
Love your channel Rick. So glad to hear you’re doing well . ❤
Greetings from Finland! Happy to hear that you are OK. You will get a ton of different takes on what kind of videos to concentrate on in the future. So the only smart solution is to make those that you like to do yourself (including more Van Halen videos)? ;-)
Rick, watching you for long and now you are like a family friend. Bit of a shock to hear about this but glad it all went well and you are feeling great.  Keep it up, great channel.
I've only been watching a couple of months but love the content and the passion, great you're doing well Rick.
Glad to see you doing well Rick. My Valve job was 15 years ago this September. The same Monday yours Valve was being done, I was getting a Pacemaker implanted. The previous Wednesday, I went into 3rd Degree Heart Block. Heart Rate down in the 20s and 30s.  Talk about making one feel like crap.  Hope you continue to heal well my friend.
Glad to hear that everything went well.
Happy to see you re looking healthy!!!!❤
Thank-you very much, Rick I'm facing exactly the same problem, even down to the afternoon crash, I'm about 5 months from getting my surgery, Canada we have waiting lists.....seeing you a week out looking so good and comfortable gives me a giant  psychological boost by taking away some worry. Again thanks for posting your story
please produce a song with an upstart band. I would love to see the process, soup to nuts.
Blessings from Mexico.
Great news 😎🍻
Happy you are well! Looking forward to many more videos!!
Great to see You're doing OK Rick!
glad you’re recovery is going going super excellent!!!
Wish you well Rick! Keep it cool!
Glad you’re well. Love your videos. Your interviews are next level.
So good to see you back online!  Wishing you continued recovery!
Good to see you back and great shape.  Thank you 😊
Hey Rick good to see you, keep up the great channel song breakdowns those are great.  Take care
So happy you are cured and healthy!!!!!!!!!!!!   Rick we love you respect you admire you and your ability to teach is amazing and yet your interviews are simply priceless.  All of them all of them.  Like with Sting who takes yoga with our daughter.  When you said I think you always find notes that excite the listener.  Not phrase goes by that is boring or the same and he said excitedly Rick you are the first person to realize that about my music       Stay healthy and keep sharing. Love and respect Berne and Pat
Glad to hear all went well and you are in good health. You and I are the same age. I've been a guitar player since Jr. High, and your infectious enthusiasm for music has brought me a lot of inspiration. Thank you!
I wish you a totally fast recovery. And new interviews! Please, I can´t find the complete Alan Parsons' interview!?!!?
Found your channel fairly recently, glad you're doing good!   As for video suggestions, I would like to see a song breakdown on "One" by Metallica (or any song from AJFA) and hear what you have to say about the missing bass. I've heard it doesn't have ANY bass or the bass is very low and almost inaudible.
Glad to see you're up and around!
Good to see you in a good shape!
glad your ok!
Im extremely happy you are HEALTHY and With us STILL.. Thank you for all you do.  I would like to see "A Band" Jam and make music.  Get some musicians together, set a plan of some music, and Jam for an hour or so.  Play some songs, play some made up song, etc.. I wanna see some jamming and creativity.  Maybe have FLEA as a guest Bass Player, please..haha!
You look healthier Rick, more color.  Great news.  🙂
Thank you RIck. I can take all the good news I can get - and this is great news. God bless you sir.
It's great to hear your surgery was a success,Rick. Here's to your future and continued good health! Ontario Fanboy...🇨🇦
Glad to see that you are OK Rick!
Lookin good, Rick!
Thanks for sharing... ...Ty Tabor interview.
Best wishes for your continued recovery, Rick, and looking forward to more of your fantastic content!
Sending love and best wishes from London fella. Mind how you go my friend..👍
Great news!  Speedy recovery.
Great news...all the very best Rick.
Thank you for sharing this. Stay well, and get better, and keep playing. And as for the channel, do what YOU find interesting, and I guarantee we'll find it interesting and valuable as well.
Damn man im glad you are safe I really appreciate the content
Im curious if you will ever have Mark Knopfler on the channel? He seems like the type who if in the USA would be down to do it
Im curious if you will ever have Mark Knopfler on the channel? He seems like the type who if in the USA would be down to do it
Stay well!!!
Sending you love and best wishes, mate! I'm very  happy the surgery went well.
keep on ticking Rick
Good to hear that everything went well and you're on the road to recovery!
Pls continue with the interview pace. I'm an amateur musician for 26 years and you poking the mind of musics greatest is super fascinating and insightful. I have  learned so much.  Hope you get well soon. Greatings from germany.
Rock and Roll is hell on the heart.
My husband and I love your interviews. We'd love to keep seeing those. We're glad you're doing better, keep it up!!
All the best and good recovery! We need you!
Awesome Rick! Lots more rocking to come!
Stay healthy and energetic , brother❤🎉.
Amazing. You look great for having surgery only a week ago. Best wishes for a full recovery.
Happy for you!
Be careful, Rick - there are guitars over 10lbs 😱
Rick, so glad to see you are back on your feet, all the best and shout out from Warsaw, Poland...kerrraaanng
I am so happy you are ok. Take care of yourself as you are.
Long life to you, Rick!  Keep doing what you're doing.  Do love the interviews.
Glad you're doing well, Rick. The Cleveland Clinic is a great place to get cardiac surgical care.
Get Well, Rick, we need you.
Glad you’re back. Glad you’re feeling great
Glad you're doing well Rick!
Thank god you’re ok. ❤❤❤❤
I’m happy you didn’t wait too long. A functioning mitral valve will change your life. Be sure to ask about cardiac rehabilitation to get back as much fitness as possible, that you might have lost waiting your op.
Hope the recovery goes well good sir. Love and good music from Greece.
Wishing you good health Rick. I had bypass surgery 13 years ago and was exactly the same. No pain other than the cough (there's a pillow for that). It is amazing what they can do with hearts. These are the days of miracles and wonder.
I am glad you are doing well.
Speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹  Love ya Rick
Hey man, heal well,  I just came home from open heart surgery -- aortic aneurism and one by pass.  I, too, am recovering well.  Not much pain. If feels like my body is saying "WTF just happened?:
Sooo happy you're doing well Rick!
Love your channel Rick. It's quickly become my favorite since I came across it a year ago. As I mentioned before, I work for the Cleveland Clinic. They do amazing work, especially in the field of cardiology 🫀. Sounds like you're as good as new. Here's to continuing health and thanks for the shout-out to my hometown.
You look really well. You are recovering well.
Heal soon!
Wow, Happy to hear everything went OK, and you pretty much seem to be back to full strength. Keep up the good work (but take it easy occasionally).
Glad you are doing well. Congrats on the surgery success!
❤
Remember to sleep, it's when your body really heals up!
You asked for guidance on which direction to take the channel. The honest fact is Rick, whatever excites you to do, we will love! You have such an awesome understanding of music theory and music production, and the magical gift of being able to explain everything so it’s accessible to everyone! Your interviews are astounding because you ask the questions that musicians want to ask, and your humble approach and lack of ego ensure you always have your guests at ease and happy to share information with us. Just do whatever you feel inspired to do, and we will be here - eternally grateful for your gifts. Thank you!🙏
Glad you're okay, Rick. You look great, especially just a week out! I had a triple bypass (at 64) last Oct. Nothing can really prepare you for having your sternum split open and having doctors tinker with your heart. Be well!
Speedy recovery, sir
Rick, Glad you are well....
heal well brother!  As to the channel...just get more and more and more guitarists showing their techniques and showing their artistry! PLEASE :)
Get well soon and take care Rick!
Amazing
It's great that when your check engine light came on you went in got it checked then fixed. Many don't and suffer the consequences.  Hope you have a complete and speedy recovery.
Just happy you are feeling better, Rick. Don`t rush it.
So pleased you have recovered well 👏
Hey Rick, so glad your surgery was successful. Going through such things is a great reminder for us not to take anything for granted and to enjoy each day to the max.  As a 76 year old with a history of heart issues, I can appreciate what you might be feeling.  As far as the direction your channel should be going in, I would simply keep doing what you have been doing.  I love the interviews and the breakdown of songs.  Talk about a class in music appreciation!  I remember as a kid listening to songs, but simply not really hearing all the parts.  Don’t know if it was the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, but my ear was not attuned to what the individual musicians were contributing.  It took me a while to find tune my listen skills to get that appreciation for what they had to offer.  Leland Sklar and Rick Haynes got me listening more closely with their wonderful bass playing and it was on from there. Would love to have attended any of the classes you taught at the college level, but absent that, your youtube presence certainly helps fill the void.  Thanks for all you do.  Wishing you good health and days full of great music. ~ Mark
You know Life is short… do what you want! We’ll still probably watch it?  An Idea would be to break down movie soundtracks.  Maybe get Martin Scorsese to sit down a cover why certain songs are placed in the movies?
we love you Rick
Sending love and wishing continued good health from Rochester ❤
Sincerely glad to hear you're doing well, Rick.
Rick you look much better, god bless you.
I’m glad you are feeling better, we need you for many many more years pal!
I've been watching your various videos here in London for years, Rick. You are such a knowledgeable musician and one hell of a guy. I wish you well, as we all do.
Take care ❤
Hey Rick, I'm a big fan of your content and love it when you come out with new videos. Keep up the awesome work and God bless your health and everything else you do my man. Godspeed brother
What an amazing positive attitude. Love your content
WHAT!!!???  If THAT is how you composed yourself with a heart issue — with that bounty of heart AND soul — the Internets are not going to be able to contain you now!  Live long and prosper, Richard the Lionheart!
You’re a national treasure Rick. So glad you’re doing well. Onward and upward !
Nothing over 10lbs?  No vintage Les Pauls Rick!!
Welcome to the zipper club!
Rick, I had a Quadruple Bypass Oct. 2020 (I also have a long Sternotomy), and I feel better than I have in years. My only warning: Watch out for Cardiologist. They are no more than Drug Pushers. I almost died from Renal Failure from their Drugs. I stopped going to them and stopped taking their drugs in Nov. 2020, and I haven’t looked back. I eat well, exercise, thank the Good Lord, and enjoy my new life. May you do the same.  On a side note: After my surgery, for some reason, something my heart surgeon had never heard of, I no longer have to wear glasses. Still 20/20 after 3 1/2 years. Weird, ‘eh?
Get back to 100%! And lay off playing a Bass VI!
Get well soon. Good to see you look great after the surgery.
Y’see, when things start to happens then you realized how ephemeral but important at same time we are, everyone, on this planet and how intricate are our lives are, in a really strange sense. I’m 53, it’s two years that I have some little walking problem, nothing comparable with your health issues, but it makes me think about the Life as we known. One day I’ll go, maybe tomorrow, maybe in 100 years, but till that day I’ll try to do my very best in me best possible way. And I’ll still watching your videos…❤️❤️❤️
Prayers to you Rick.   I'm not musically inclined at all.  Tried years ago and I guess some people just don't have it.  I relive my innocent years of high school & college now coming up on 50 years ago with you as an escape from the world we now live in.  Between you and Casey Kasem  replays on YouTube I not only enjoy the memories of old, but get extra trivia ammunition for my friends.  Please take care of yourself for You, your family and us of course.   Went to music in the park here in good old Nebraska last night and not only enjoyed hits of the 60's and 70's, but it was from a group still around that a couple old people used to listen & dance too back in college....
Good to get Your medical report - it seems like everything went as it should - sounds like a very advanced procedure You went through. I was in Cleveland for a few days 12 years ago and visited two museums, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame* and the Cleveland Museum of Art (very impressive!). Hope You have been to both of them. Greetings from Sweden also.  * Wanda Jackson had just been "installed" in the museum. I was lucky see/hear her perform in Stockholm about that time - at that time 72 years old and it was something like 90 minutes with a 150 % energy level - how was it even possible? (no heart problems there)- I was up close to the stage - only having a couple of about 9 year old kids in front of me -they were jumping up and down throughout the whole concert.... Bought a few of Wanda's CD:s and photos (perhaps taken 50 years earlier) with her signature on them -the photos have an honorary place on a wall in my home.
Rick, we are so glad that your surgery went so well. We all really care about you and want you to live a long life.
You look great!  I'm glad you got it taken care of.  I'm glad you shared this, because it sounds terrifying.  It will make people who need this done much more confident.
Congrats on a successful procedure!
3.3K comments already so I guess you’ll not see this one, but thank you Rick for doing the best you can always
All the Best, Rick! Get well soon! And please take care of yourself. 🫶🏻 cheers from Germany
Stay healthy Rick go at your own pace
🙏🥂  I also had the “ open heart” procedure too in 2020 to replace my Arotic valve AND an arotic root aneurysm here in Charleston!  You are so right about thinking about it and then bam your out and then back again like a light switch “ hopefully”!  I too am doing great 4 years later playing 5 nights a week still at 67 now!  Love your channel my friend and God Bless you✨  EP “Everything Is Different Now”  Spotify
Take care Rick! Lost my dad just after Easter to heart problems. Glad you’re doing well.
Glad to hear that you are doing well now Rick, modern medicine is indeed amazing. We should all be thankful for the skills of our wonderful healthcare professionals. Wishing you all the best for a continued recovery, cheers from down under 🇦🇺
Congratulations on the success of your surgery.  Interestingly I go in for heart surgery in three days on Thursday.  I’m my case it is a simpler procedure, a heart catheterization where they run a tube in and check things out.  They think there may be partial blockage of an artery.  If so they will install a stent at the same time.  I have slight regurgitation of the mitral valve but the valve appears to be operating properly so maybe it is back pressure form the partial blockage?  Just guessing now but they will explain all they find on Thursday.
All the best man👍💪
" my heart stopped " you gotta song there.  Bless your healing.
All the best Rick!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  John 3:16 ❤
Don’t worry about the scar, we’re all thankful you’re recovering and in good spirits!
Take care!
All the best, Mr Beato!
Rick, thank you for keeping us in the know.  We love you like a brother from another mother.  I had the Da Vinci robot mitral valve repair in 2020 (during COVID).  Amazing yo hear you are doing so well.  Hey, as far as planning goes, let me share with you the reason I started watching your channel.  I happened upon your breakdown of Boston’s “More Than a Feeling” and you had me.  That was period song for me (1977/1978) when I knew I’d be graduating from college (Indiana University) but I didn’t want to be an adult, get married and get a real job.  All I wanted to do was rock and roll.   Your analysis of the song was so spot on, and it took me back to where (and why) I wanted to be.  Keep up with the song (or group/entertainer) breakdowns.  That is your forte and your fans’ favorite.  Thanks for all you do, El Monte Slim
Me too, I had the robotic surgery. But your recovery looks waaaaaay faster than mine.And I'm a bit younger.
dude. awesome you handled it
So great to hear.  All too many people don’t deal with health issues in a timely fashion, that’s when the really bad things happen. So good that you were proactive!
Congratulations!! Sending love and peace! You’ve changed the world many times over ⭐️ keep shining!
I was the editor of an online music publication for many years and we had a feature called " health notes " where we reported and gave information pertaining to musicians and artists health. You've re-inspired me Mr Beato. Stay well and keep doing this wonderful show!
Get well Rick .  The Cleveland Clinic saved my life over 50 years ago . They are the best
Glad to see you up and around.
Blimey Rick! When someone said Rick needed a valve repaired, I thought they meant a 12 AX7 for your amp! Glad you are looking well after all that surgery.
Prayers for you Rick! Here’s some scripture I hope is a blessing to you. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 and Ephesians 2:8-10
Wishing you health and comfort, sir.
Glad to see you doing so well. Wishing you a full recovery. God bless.
Glad you’re doing fine.  I absolutely love the what makes this song  great videos.  When you do a favorite of mine it makes me love it even more.  A great example of that was the If You Could Read My Mind one.  It blew me away! Love the channel.
Rick Beato is a star. May he keep shining bright for a long long time. I love it when younger folk post videos saying Rick is Wrong. They have no idea. GBY, Mr Beato.
Go on my son``  ( thats English for well done and now get on with it! )
Love from Brisbane,Australia. Glad you are ok
Glad to know you’re on the mend Rick - your musician/songwriter/producer/engineer interviews are a Smithsonian level documentation of what is likely the most musically creative period in human history - so more please ! Everyone talks about Donald Fagen (as a stone SD fan that would be amazing), but also new talents like singer/guitarist/songwriter Judith Hill...
Glad you're ok!
We often put off surgery until we are not very well and the recovery is a lot longer because of that.  If you can have it while you are fairly good health you can be back to your normal routine in days most of the time.  We are our own worst enemies sometimes.
When you think about it it's crazy the things we (humanity) are able to do now, I mean they open you up, stop you heart and fix it, put everything back together and in a weeks time you are up and about (with limitations) like almost nothing happened. Glad everything went ok, wishing that your road to full recovery keeps going well.
Glad to see you are doing well Rick. Could you do some more vids on ear training? As an intermediate bass player there are tricky songs that are in different keys to what you’d expect and chord progressions that go in unexpected directions. Thanks.
Much respect and good wishes Rick.  I’m glad you’re back!
Damn Rick. Scared me there brother!
Take courage Rick! Virtual hug.
Rick, I'm glad your surgery went well. I'm not sure if you received the free gift of eternal salvation yet but I hope you will. Grace through faith in Jesus's death on the cross to become our sin and be spared of God's wrath. God reconciled  Himself to is through Jesus's sacrifice. But we still have to choose to be reconciled to Him. Again Grace through faith, not by works (like all other religion) so that no man may boast. Please consider, Jesus invites us to Him.   Again, so happy for your health. I'm from so cal but sister lives in Cleveland. I love the city and I've heard The Cleveland Clinic is the best.
Glad to see you’re ok!
I'm glad your well Rick
Great to hear!
Literally diving to rehab to see mom who just had triple bypass surgery. I was so scared, was actually shaking that day. The greatest wealth is health 🙏
Hey Rick - So glad to hear that your heart surgery was successful and you're already back in the saddle. As you know, the heart gives us warnings when something's out of whack. I remember my father's energy level went way down shortly before he needed a triple bypass years ago.
Now your part of the Zipper Club :-)     Happy recovery.
Very glad that surgery went well and that you are feeling better!  Love your vids, knowledge, and perspective.
Glad you're on the mend.   Would love to see song recording/producing content.   For example, recording Billionaire.  Or a whole video series of you working with an artist again - producing and recording them would be amazing.  Thanks
Is it true that for the first few days of recovery, your heart was beating in 5/4?
Thank you for the update and grateful for the success of your surgery.  All best, Rick!
You're the best music interviewer of all time and I'm glad you are doing good!
Get 100% well soon, Rick. You rock.
Get well soon ✌️
Sincere best wishes for a full recovery Rick
Welcome back Rick!!!
Get well soon.  Thoughts and prayers for your recovery 🙏🙏🙏!!!
Heal up well Rick. Love your videos and your strong, informed opinions on great music.
🫀 🥂
You are OK. That's the main thing. God Bless...
Glad you are doing well Rick !!
Here's hoping for a speedy recovery and to many more years creating content for the masses!!  You Rock, Rick!!
Rick, glad to hear you got your valve fixed and had it done at the best place in the world for that procedure. Great to see you on the mend and look forward to a lot more of your channel!
Get lots of rest!
So glad you're all good sir!
Best wishes for the speediest of recoveries!  For me, your interviews are just the best.
Continue on your healing vector sit!
Welcome back, Rick. Glad you’re OK.
Glad you’re doing well, Rick. MV Regurgitation can be asymptomatic for many years and fatigue/tiredness are often attributed to anemia and Vitamin deficiencies among other things. Open heart surgery is major procedure. So rest well, take your time and give time to recover. Best wishes for a speedy recovery! ❤
Glad to hear you're doing well. Take care of yourself Rick, there's a lot off ppl out here pulling for you.
👊🏼
So glad to see you are well Rick, and wishing you the best of health and success. As for the channel, please continue with the interviews as they are historical documents with these artists while we still have them, and your song breakdowns are always super fun too! Cheers, Dennis.
I'm 2 weeks older than you. That tired feeling is called age - LOL. Seriously, glad you're doing better.
Glad it went well. I wish you prosperity, good health, and long life...
I’m glad you are doing better!
Looking good, man. I'm glad your surgery went well!
So stoked you are okay Rick. No lifting Les Pauls my friend. Soon! One day at time my man.   And hey, I would love to see you do some cool song writing collabs with smaller channels like mine. Gotta through it our there you never know. Plus, you really inspired me to give YT a go and it's starting to really take off. Sharing music and the love of music with others is the greatest thing in the world.  Thank you for all you do for all of us. Keep going!
Just Info: Easily exhausted & shortness of breath may be high blood pressure. Cold sweats, dull ache in middle of back, chest pain, shortness of breath may be heart issues/attack.
Great recovery, glad to know you are well. The channel? Hard to say Rick, every thing you you did was alway top notch. Maybe go into production more, how to record and capture sounds in the studio, how a board works, how it was done for those classic albums and how it could still make great sounding recordings for contemporary artists. Anyways, I don't really know if this makes sense or not. Cheers, all the best. MC
Nothing over 10 lbs..... so no Les Paul's? Jk, hahaha, glad to hear you are okay.
Hollow bodies only.
Recover well! By the way, today was one year ago you was in Stockholm. I was the guy who asked if it was ok to use the thumb for a chord.
Take care, your health and family comes first.
Don’t worry mate…had a quintuple bypass at 43 years old and still going…just a year shy of you. Still have a glass of wine and the odd desert…just stay away from the processed crap and regular walking will see you through next 20 yrs👍
So happy that things went great
I'm glad you're ok and recovering well!
Take care Rick always enjoy your utube shows great stuff !
Take care Rick and listen to your wife!  ha ha ha  She has your best interest at heart!
So glad everything went well. Love your videos and what you do. Music needs you, we need you!!
A full and speedy recovery to you, Rick!
Take care buddy, recover properly and have a long and great life!
Good to hear your on the mend Rick- take it easy man :)
Glad to hear you're recovering nicely... Listen to the Dr and take it easy.
I particularly liked your interviews with the recording engineers - that gave me some good tips/tools for my own recording efforts.
I’ve been watching your channel for a long time and I really like the evolution that I’ve seen. I particularly like the interviews, you ask the best music related questions.
Meno male. Che la saluta ti accompagni ancora
Dr Caldwell B Essylston Jr from Cleveland Clinic. Heart Surgeon and now leads charge on how Whole Food Plants Prevent AND Reverse Heart Disease!! Highly recommend you speak with him to prevent issues again Rick. Check him out on YouTube. Much Love Rick ❤
Didn’t know about that. Hope you recover fully. I really learn with you on this channel.
I second these emotions. Love yah Rick✌️🇦🇺❤️🌹
In your interview with Steve Lukather “ it’s the decade of replacement parts “. Be well
You look like you lost some weight but otherwise glad to see you smiling and sounding upbeat. Wishing you a good recovery, Rick.
so no Les Pauls :)
Glad all went well for your surgery!
In 1971 my college roommate’s father had that exact surgery.  His was performed in Indianapolis but he lived near a town of 80,000 people and the surgery was front page news. He was hospitalized for almost 2 weeks afterwards and lived a long life after the operation.
Glad that it all went well! I wish you a good reconvalescene, and I'm very happy that you will stick around for hopefully many more years to come. One of my best friends has a new heart since a while now and I am so glad that we, as a modern society, have come so far to have those types of surgery become the everyday business for the surgeons and hospital personnel. On a more political side, I hope that this will evolve postively in the future or at least stay this way. Cast your votes wisely, folks ;)
Nice to see you on the mend! Enjoyed the Send Her My Love solo❤
I'm glad you're doing so well after surgery! I'm 55 and have had 4 open heart surgeries (BTW, Welcome to the "zipper club"), 3 of which were emergencies. It seems that recovery for me has been increasingly more difficult with each one. The last one, 3 years ago, I had a massive seizure the day after surgery that left me partially paralyzed. It's taken a long time to get my strength back and to learn to walk again. Bless you for all you do, your family and the wonderful videos you work so hard to make for our enjoyment! Get your rest and listen to your doctors! \m/
So glad to hear you are doing well! God bless you and what you do for us music lovers.
I don't know you but I feel like I know you... love you brother, best wishes and speedy recovery!!!!🤲🏾🤲🏾🤲🏾🤲🏾
Don't hurry back, man. Take care.
blessings
Health always, welcome home
Take care of yourself. The world is better with you in it.
So your heart skipped a Beat-o! I'm looking forward to listening to the work only you can do!
Thank god you’re good. 👍 ❤
Glad you are ok, you video on Coldplay - Amsterdam is one of my favorites and I would love to see another style of video like that one
Don't die, Rick! We need you!
So glad you're well. Please keep focusing on interviews! Lots of legendary figures are getting way up there in age.
Glad you're okay.  Cheers.
Thank you for sharing this with us. Being vulnerable in this way is not easy, especially with something public like this. I pray your recovery is swift and that you flourish in this new season of your life. God Bless!
Happy to hear you are doing well @rickbeato!
Rick - glad to hear you're taking care of yourself - knowing you will live long and prosper!  As for the direction of the channel going forward, I'd like to see you reach out beyond your comfort zone a bit more, into some genres that you have less personal experience with.  Some notable guitar omissions that I've noticed have been Stevie Ray Vaughn and Billy Strings.  A deeper look into lyrics and vocal stylings would also be welcome.  I'm just a little older than you, also a longtime performer and college music instructor.  I frequently direct my students (and friends) to your videos on one topic or another.  Keep up the great work!
Severe Regurgitation... Now there's a proper band name :) Rock on, Rick!
Very glad to know you're well, Rick. You've made a real difference to me and I am sure many others. I know I am thankful.
All the best😊
It’s stinks that you had to have surgery Rick, yet I’ll tell you from personal experience. It’s good that it happened to you around 50. My injury was a nurse misdiagnosed me at 19 years old. Life can throw things at us that we don’t expect. I’m happy to see that you’re able to still do your channel!
Yay Rick!!!!! Great news!
All the best. Have a nice recovery.
Rick, you are such a legend and a truly lovely human being. I’m glad you’ve recovered and have got through this unfortunate condition. Good fortune to you man and forever on. 🙏🏻❤️
Great to see you're feeling good. My father went through that type of surgery, same issue years ago and he's still ok almost 20 years later. Have a good recovery while we wait for new great content :) Cheers
Wishing you a successful recovery
I wish you a full recovery.
You're looking amazing Rick! Great to have you back!
I’m so glad you’re alright Rick. Such an amazing person, and super valuable to all of us.
Crazy how we know ourselves better than doctors these days. I also have heart condition myself and I am so up as to the days where I always check myself. So glad you are so up on your health. Sending great health wishes so glad you are doing better. As far as the channel you do you and so glad you are doing better. ❤
All the best Rick. Glad that everything went well with the surgery. 🙏
Much love Rick….  God bless.  🙏🏻
I'm glad the surgery went well Rick. Thank you for sharing your knowledge!
God bless. All our best wishes for your speedy recovery, Rick. Hugs to you and your family. At the risk of sounding selfish. We need Rick Beato.
Wow, had no idea, you are looking good...
Hey Rick, just wishing you the best, from a long time viewer here. I hit 40 this year, my dad had a heart attack 3 weeks ago... glad to see you take it seriously and don't ignore what your body tells you. Modern medicine really is wonderful. Cheers man, love you.
So glad you are well. Really love your videos and your energy! Best wishes from Moscow
Glad you're all patched up
Sending you well wishes and hugs, including some extra hugs to your family! Recovery is not a solo endeavor. I love your channel and passion for good tunes 🤘🎶
More Queen reflated stuff please!! Your looking well great to have you back 👍
Rick, we are counting on you to be here with us for at least another 30 years! Keep on rocking in the free world!
Stay safe, stay well Rick Beato!
Love the channels and really glad you're doin well! National treasure says it all.  Best Wishes and Good Health!
Get well soon, Glad you tended to it.  Damn near the same age!
Continued good health to you!
Love you Rick. Don’t go anywhere. ❤
Incredible!  Glad you're on the mend.  Be well.  \m/  Best.
Glad you’re okay Rick, you’re a bloody good bloke and i love your channel. All the best, 👍🇬🇧
Get well soon Rick - the Cleveland Clinic is one of the best (has a great reputation even over here in England).
ur a cool dude. great musical mind. glad ur ok.
Glad you are doing well Rick!!
Rick - It's great to see you back in your studio so soon, and here's wishing you a speedy recovery to full strength. Take care and all the best, Rowan.
Glad you are still doing what you love.  Many of us are always watching.
Good to hear that it went well
Happy you're back and at it, Rick!!
Don't play a Gibson
Hey Rick, glad you’re well. All the best!!
I vote for more what makes this song great. I have learned so much from watching those videos about how music is made and fits together.
GOD BLESS YOU RICK ... MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU!
Glad you’re doing well Rick, I have a heart condition too (leaking aortic valve) and seeing how well you’ve recovered is reassuring. I’m 23 and due an operation in the next year or two, so thank you for the video and I hope you carry on doing well in the future.
So good to see you doing so well
It's amazing how you have been able to create this beautiful connections with us all. I read the comments and we all feel the same. You are special Rick. Thank you.
Glad to hear you're better, keep on keeping on.
Glad to hear all is good. Surgery is scary at all ages. I had a kidney transplant 5 years ago. I was called in the middle of the night to go to the hospital and I had to go alone because of COVID. But you are right modern medicine is nothing short of magic. I was walking 2 days after a 9 hours operation.
what a drag it is getting old  The channel is always solid.  There can never be enough what makes this song great and I oddly miss the rudiments of theory being presented quarterly or so.  One can never make enough fun of the wretched state of corporate pop.  The interviews have been amazing.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Modern science is so, so, so cool!
Always good to have a planned surgery, not emergency so You did good. Nice checkup history.  Recover well and we all be waiting for new content.  Keep rocking Rick!
Χαίρομαι πολύ για σένα Rick! Αύριο θα κλείσω ραντεβού σε καρδιολόγο.  Το ανέβαλλα καιρό,  αλλά  ήρθε η ώρα! Να είσαι καλά και περαστικά.  Φιλιά  από  Ελλάδα!
Glad you are doing well, Rick. To your health!
Congratulations Rick, you look a picture of health for your ordeal. I had a triple bypass last Christmas so i know how you feel. Just take things easy and don't be tempted to lift anything heavy. Look forward to more videos from you. Best wishes from the U.K
Congrats my friend on the surgery. Now its gym time. You must exercise every day. Don't have to kill your self just 30 minutes of light cardio. Everyday. Move into light weights. You can get a free gym membership through Medicare Advantage with United or Aetna. Fact of the matter is at our age you stop moving you start dying. Taking lots of heart vitamin's has helped me too there's some great stuff out there. Good luck.
Glad to hear all's well.🤗
Rick, wow!  That's pretty big news.  I'm glad you're ok.  I'm glad you went to Cleveland Clinic for your procedure.  I'm originally from Shaker Hts, Ohio, a stone's throw from where you were.  Many of my friend's dads and moms worked there.  They're the best in the world at heart stuff.    As for you and your channel.  You're kinda the best in the world too.  I love your insights and your instructions.  You're just about a year older than me, so our perspectives about music and its changes in quality over time tend to track.  You're the expert and I am the fan, so you provide the substance what, for me, would otherwise just be unsubstantiated notions and biases.  Get well, and I'll be here for whatever you feel up to sharing.
Rick, we want you sticking around for a long time. Glad the procedure was a success!
To one of the most sincere people on YouTube, you should just do what makes you happy and don't worry about what we want.  Enjoy what you do ... we  only get one shot at life.  The rest of us ... we're just icing Rick.  We'll be there, but frankly, we don't matter!!  Stay happy and true to you ... that's why we show up!!
Good to have you back! Hope you are okay! Best always Kim
Doesn’t hurt? Awesome, I’d think getting your ribs cracked would hurt for a few weeks.
Congratulations on the successful surgery. I had bypass surgery at Cleveland Clinic in 1995 - almost 30 years ago and not an issue since. And they split my sternum, too. That first cough to get everything out was easy for me. Some say it was difficult, but mine was one cough, up it came, and done.
Had to tinker with your ticker.
Just a pit stop to fine tuning, then next 62 y.o.!
We take our health and doctors, nurses, etc sometimes for granted. So glad you’re healthy and back at it. Would love to see some things on production and arrangement choices- yours or others
I'm glad you're well, Rick. Love your channel. Best wishes.
Glad to hear the surgery went well Rick!! To be completely honest with you, I’ve been watching this channel intermittently for the past five years or so, but ever since you started doing the interviews I’ve been a regular watcher! You really do host some of the most insightful and thoughtful interviews on this platform, and I think your years of experience working behind the scenes in the industry has given you this perspective that allows you to cut out a lot of the bullshit that other interviewers tend to focus on and really get into detail around the process of making music. Like, you’re the only person on this platform who I can count on to give me real insight to the recording and writing some of my favourite albums of all time, and I’ve genuinely picked up a lot of cool recording and songwriting techniques that I use regularly when making music for myself. Plus your guests always seem to have a very mutual respect for you when they come on which leads to some really gripping conversations! So ya more interviews please!! Very glad you’re healthy and can continue doing them!
Several years ago my aorta cracked sort of OPEN.  I also had open heart surgery where a piece of dacron was inserted where the cracked aorta was.  It took me some months to really recuperate totally from the surgery, but I am fine now.  I am glad that your recovery was swift and total.
Glad you're doing well.
Glad you are feeling better!Thank you for being so open with this!
Hope you're healing up well Rick. Great Chanel and great tutorials!
Rick, so happy you came through the surgery successfully and are relatively pain free. I've had heart bypass surgery so I understand what you've been through, at least physically. It ain't fun. But man, the heart surgeons (and the anesthetists and the rest of the team who keep us alive while the surgeon does his magic) are real heroes -- the Top Guns of medicine. So here you are already looking ahead to making more great vids for us. I was a bop trumpeter in my younger days (I'll be 86 later this week) and a devoted subscriber, and I can't thank you enough for expanding my view to all genres of music and how it gets played and recorded. Love all the fantastic talks you've shared with the players, innovators and engineers. Stay healthy. ❤
Glad you’re feeling better!
I'm glad you are doing your back in business. Channel is awesome, btw.
Glad you had a speedy recovery! All the best to you Rick!
Bring back, what makes this song great. That’s how I got into your channel.
Te ves MUY BIEN RICK !!!!. Cuida mucho de ti. Y todos te apoyamos !!!! You look GREAT RICK !!!! Take good care of you. All we, do prays for you !!!!
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick and wishing you a speedy recovery!  Hoping in the future you'll include some more content on Van Halen 😃
Music Heals ❤🎼🎵🎶🎸
So glad it went so well.thak you sir for everything u do for all of us.
First of all and most importantly, thank God that your surgery went well and take it easy during this healing time. My second request would be for you to please please do a breakdown of Jacob Collier Mahogany session of the song, Little Blue? With your acoustic guitar I would love to hear your synopsis of how he put it all together. Third of all it really doesn’t matter what you do because your videos are all pretty awesome and thank you for all the gifts you give to musicians. Take care, my friend.
We are all with you, Rick: we love you and your contribution to the music world and our good thoughts are with you always, brother!!!
Be well amigo
I didn't see the post, but as a member of the zipper club it's amazing the skills surgeons have to repair a delicate muscle. glad you are up and about.
I'm not a musician but I do enjoy your content. So happy your doing well.. I particularly enjoy your song breakdown and analysis.
Scary stuff! Glad you’re ok!
So glad you are doing well and better than before!
Good to see you up and about. 🙏
Cool - your ok 👍🏻
Great to see y back dog.
GWS - the (music, and not just) world needs you.  Love from tiny Malta!
love from cleveland!
Sounds like inspiration for a new blues song.  You could call it Heart Valve Blues. 🎸🎸🎸
They getcha switched over to ball bearings?  Everything's switching over to ball beatings these days. I hope you have a speedy recovery good sir
I wish I coulda met you! Just down the street at the West Side Market!!
Hey Rick, I'm pleased to see that you came back in one piece. All the best to you from Germany! Cheers, Lutz
Glad you made it through. Keep up the great work.
I just got diagnosed with a hear problem. it is very scary. Thanks for the inspiration and get well soon.
best wishes from Costa Rica!!! Pura Vida!
We love you, Mr. Beato! Good to know you are back after your Oil Change! Keep Rocking! 🎸
Thank goodness you had that now, not in the late 90s, when they would have been talking valve replacement surgery.  Glad that you are recuperating well.  I'd like to see some more song breakdowns (but not of the All-Star "Star-Spangled Banner" please!  Star Mangled would be a more accurate title...
Glad you're feeling better Rick! Blessings to you and your family.
God Bless Rick
All the best Rick we 'need' you...
Prayers for you Rick ❤️! I’m a 47 year old and have had heart and lung failure-but I thank God for music and your videos! You’ve introduced me to a ton of music I never would’ve heard had it not been for you…thank you.
Thanks for keeping us updated, Rick. It’s wonderful that you are feeling the positive effects of the hardware upgrade! Keep doing what you do so well, and so naturally… 🙌🏼
Le deseo muy buena salud desde Patagonia, Argentina.
My wife and I both enjoy your channel.  The lessons, music theory, and interviews we think are all great.  You could continue as you have been doing and we would be fine.  If you take a new direction, I am certain it would be nice as well.  Most important is that your surgery went well, and you are in an improved state of health.
I had the exact same procedure 5 years ago (although I was 35 at that stage). Take your time to recover, do not rush anything.  All the best for you and keep rocking!
Speedy and full recovery Rick!!  Hey, who are you trying to fool?  You probably normally don't lift anything over 10lbs anyway, right?  I'm glad your doctor didn't put any limits of the amount of notes or chords you are allowed to play while recovering.  :-)
You are one of the great ones. Your interviews are the best. Thanks for hosting Tom and Guthrie, outstanding and rare. Keep up the good work. You are a pioneer.
Thank you for the open and honest update. I'm a long time fan and I'm glad you're recovering well.
Rick, so glad your surgery was a success! I hope and pray for a full recovery. God bless!
May God Bless
I'm glad you made it through your surgery and have recovered so much in so little time. Just remember, leave the moving of amps to others for the next 5 weeks.  Just spent 3 weeks in the hospital with cellulitis and severe sepsis. Lost 25 lbs. I'm in my 70's.
Happy healing!
The worst thing about 'open heart surgery' is the midline sternotomy or when they cut your breastbone in half to access the heart.  That's what causes most of the post operative pain.  Love your channel and I hope you have a speedy recovery.
Godspeed! You're the G O A T!
You look great Rick! Everybody look after your heart. My dad did and he had a valve replaced which gave him 7 extra years in fairly good health. My mom didn't pay attention to symptoms chalking it up to her age and we lost her last year. Take care everybody
Sending positive vibes from the UK Rick ❤
Can't play a Les Paul Rick! 13lbs!Happened to me 2007. I feel great!
What a blessing you are Rick!  So happy that you have the best people looking after you... Plus the "Big Man upstairs,,," He's a subscriber too!!!  Love ya brother!
Glad to hear that Rick! It’s been quite an extensive intervention… Take all the time you need. Wish you a quick recovery!
Welcome back, Rick!  All the best!!! 🤗
would love your comment on Los Blues - If You Must Leave My Life - Jim Webb (1971)
Take it easy, Rick. Keep on looking after number one.
I've got the same problem (don't need surgery), but I understand what you mean about getting tired, and I'm glad you're doing well, Rick. Now you can keep the awesome videos coming!
Good on ya , Rick . Glad you're better .
Rick, take things REALLY slowly. You may feel great, but your body's been traumatized and needs a lot of time to recover properly. Speaking from experience. While you're recovering, how about researching a video on Rory Gallagher... who was voted best guitarist in the world by Melody Maker in the UK in 1973 (I think)...
Great video Rick, it’s good to show people such a positive outcome! It caught my eye because I am a year older than you and just had Anastasia for a minor procedure myself this week, made me think things could be worse! You can add this to your “ Get off my Lawn” series… Laugh.   Seriously though you look great and good to see you well Steve Van Ness
This was the best news to come out of the U.S. this week, outshining Kamala Harris, Biden and Trump! 🇺🇲 Viva la Musica 🎵
Glad you’re doing well!
Modern medicine and surgery is just amazing.  Get well, Rick!  We all enjoy your channel!!
My best wishes for a swift and complete recovery, Rick! You are a light in an oft times dark world! God bless you, my Friend!
Glad to see / hear that it went well and that you’re doing better, Rick!!
So happy your cardiologist kept an eye on it, and that you finally had it addressed with out a hitch.  I was just in to see my cardiologist today, because I have a aortal aneurysm that I need to keep an eye on
For the channel, music has and is going through a profound technology transition. I really enjoy your informed commentary on that.
A mix of interviews and instructional is great
Sending best wishes to you for a continued speedy recovery. Great to see you well.
Glad you are ok !
Keep Chill  ...
So glad it went well for you, Rick. Here's to another 62 years.
Rick, I'm very glad you're okay. You keep doing what you do and follow your instincts. All of your videos are great!
We know you’ve been an MVP for years. 😎  Hope all continues to go well for you.
For your own good Do Not Listen to top 10 songs on spotify, its not good for your heart... always be safe man❤ love you
Good news, Rick! I would say you have a good formula, so just keep going, good stuff.
35 here with same condition from birth. Glad to hear that it go so well. The medicine and doctors can do miracles these days. And thank you for making this great chanel!
Great news, happy that you are feeling better. Anything you do on the channel is great.
Sending good vives from Brazil. Hope you be good , friend!
Glad you're right mate 👍
Wish you a speedy recovery Rick! Your work Is awesome.
35 here with same condition from birth. Glad to hear that it go so well. The medicine and doctors can do miracles these days. And thank you for making this great chanel!
Glad you got it worked out with no complications!  Keep up the great work!
Wow! I had CABG X4 twice in 12 hrs as the first op failed. I can promise you I was in no condition to make a YouTube video a week later! Amazing Rick but don't over do it mate.
Incredible to see you so post-op powerful!! Go get 'em, Rick!!
This is a better planet because you are on it, Rick. Stay healthy!
God Rick ! I wish you the best in getting healthy and I’ve heard nothing but great things about Cleveland Clinics the best of the best , hears to your health!
glad to see you back!
get well, Rick
Hey Rick, so happy to hear your heart surgery was successful, you look Amazing! I've been subscribed to your channels for about four years now at the urging of my guitar teacher. I'm 71 and picked up a guitar for the first time about 8 years ago and I learn so much from your channels, THANK YOU!
Glad surgery went well, and hoping for a speedy recovery.
Incredibly happy to hear you are recovering perfectly Rick!
Did they replace the valve with a mechanical or like a pig valve?  My son has aortic valve stenosis and head a balloon procedure nearly 10 years ago and he has minimal leakage, so no replacement is necessary yet.  We just go back every year....we go back this Friday.  He's 19.
Glad to hear you're good Rick
I am so glad for you Rick.
Happy recovery. I’m happy your operation is a success.👍👍🇨🇦
💚Rick
Very good to hear you're doing well Rick, take it easy for as long as you need and don't lift a Les Paul!  All the best.
I had that same surgery about 6 years ago and am better than I had been in quite a few years. I was 60 at the time. I look forward to more videos from you.
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick! All the best!
So pleased to hear of the success of the surgery. You are an invaluable resource, Rick - thank you so much. I just taught part of your lesson on intervals to my students in prison today.
Get well soon Rick!
Our next breath is a gift
Cracking channel, glad you're on the mend!!! Great news.
Glad you are getting this done now. My dad needed valve replacement and put it off for about 10 years. He made it through the surgery, but didn't survive the recovery. Best trumpet player I've ever heard; RIP dad.
So great you had that done and are doing well! Can’t wait to see what the future holds for you and the channel! All the best brother!
Godspeed, Rick. Glad you are OK. Rock on!
You can play guitar still, rad! Glad it worked out well for you, that is quite amazing Rick!
In glad you are fine. Going under the surgery requires a lot of bravery!
Praise God!
Get better Rick! Desejando o melhor pra você do Brasil.
Glad you are doing well, Rick. Thank you for the update.
Glad you're on the mend and the surgery was successful. Continued recovery and well wishes!
Glad you are OK
well done Rick! stay with us
It’s going to take a while for the enormity of this procedure to sink in. Take it slow and steady. We all love you and your work. Well still be here ❤️❤️
So thankful you are well!  Cheers!
Thank God Rick everything is good. You have way to much to do still.
Rick, just got home from my cardiologist.  Had a cardioversion today. Was thinking about you. Hopefully this works and I won't have to have anything invasive. Keep rocking brother!!!
(A) You come first (B) everything else is a bonus...
Rick, I’m so glad you’re doing well! I’ve read your other comments and they’re all true. We treasure your virtual friendship and we know that if given the opportunity in person it would even be better congratulations on the surgery and recovery.
I heard More than a Feeling on the radio today and was instantly transported to your WMTSG episode which really opened up that track for me in new ways. Stay strong, and keep ‘em coming. I love your channel. Keep being you. It’s your personality that keeps it all fresh.
Hard to recommend what I'd like to see in future videos. I never miss one and I've either learned something useful or felt inspired in some way. So keep up the good work. And, I've got several of my music buddies hooked on your channel as well. It's cool when we get together and one of us will ask, "Hey, did you see Rick's latest video?"
Old Rockers never stop rolling, roll on brother, roll on!
Glad you're ok Rick.
Be strong!
Glad to hear you're doing okay
Great to see you back fit as a fiddle..
Interesting that you went to Clevland.  The best heart hospital in the nation.  I can't believe that you got up so quickly!
I'm from Spain and I think that, for music lovers, this guy is a music treasure. I'm glad everything went well and looking forward to watching more videos and enjoying your musical wisdom. Gracias por ser un tipo tan generoso, Rick.
And you didn't say anything about insurance companies.  Good you are doing well.
Wish you a strong recovery❣️😊
I would love to see more than just english and spanish songs on your chanel, ❤
Take care Rick and look after yourself.  I had an emergency triple bypass in 2015 and still going strong at 72 :)
Good news. Take care. Health and well-being come first.
Brilliant news, glad the op went well.
I am glad that surgery went well and that you are recovering so quickly
Glad you're recovering well. Stay strong!
Fellow cardiac patient here. It’s a real attention-getter when the old ticker acts up. Sounds as if you’re in capable hands. Don’t forget that your heart was beating months before you were born. Here’s hoping that it keeps steady rhythm. “Staying Alive” and all that. 👍
glad to hear you're doing better! take it easy for a while :)
Looking great, Rick! Best wishes for continued recovery!
I have a arrhythmia caused by a flaw in the electrical part of my heart so, I visited my cardiologist every 6 months and take my pills. It is scrary at first but as times goes by you get used to it. Take care and follow your doctor instructions.
Get well. Keep up the good work
Notice how the camera suspiciously avoids showing his feet? Is this the real Rick Beato, or an imposter? 🤣 Best wishes Rick (...or is it Mick?)
Here is to the new valve & plenty of new videos!!!
Stay strong my friend. The world is a better place with you in it.
What's next?  How about this:  How about finding one or two super talented, COMPLETELY UNKNOWN bands who are making innovative and interesting original music, interviewing them, working with them to cut a couple songs in your studio, and  document the whole thing?  That might be super interesting.  Moving from the super famous to the undiscovered.  Opposite end of the spectrum.
Heart ❤ - "Barracuda" 🐟  was playing in my head while watching this.
Happy things went well,mate. All the best with your recovery. All of us want to have your awesome videos for as long as possible.
🙏❤️💪🏼
So glad you're okay!
I love love love the interviews. They are like opening a new book cover when you get that slight fragrance of milled paper. You know something good is on deck and every minute of stories is a lifetime of remote places we can peer into. The artists become friends and acquaintances with whom I wish to hang out. Keep them coming, please.
My Cleveland Heart, Jackson Browne
I'm so happy you got your procedure done. My dad felt so much better and lived such a better life after he had a valve replacement.
Well done Rick, so heartwarming to see you back! ❤
Glad you are on the mend Rick!
Get well soon. :love your work..
Hey Rick!  I'm impressed that you're doing so well after only a week.  I also have moderate-to-severe regurgitation.  If/when I have the procedure, I hope to do as well as you!  Best wishes!
Love you Rick stay healthy and strong brother we need you!! 💪🏽🫀
Thats fantastic Rick you are a music god keep going😊
Cardiac and vascular surgery today are remarkable. What surgeons can do is like science fiction.
I find you always interesting . Keep on keeping on. Best wishes
So glad the surgery went well. Now is the time to rest and recover. Keep well
Happy to hear Your Good News Rick!
🤟❤National Treasure indeed !
Man, you look amazing for 1 week out!  Glad you are doing well!
My vote is to continue with the Musician/Engineer/Producer interviews. Great if you could get Gary Green (guitarist from Gentle Giant)
Great news Rick, I'm so glad that you're with us.
Good to hear you Feel fine Rick. Looking forward to your New video’s, but first take some time  off My beloved teacher!
Glad to see you well.
I'm so happy you are alright and doing great ! Hoping you have a speedy healing. Love ya channel and you, thank you so much for bringing all things music to the masses 😊❤🎶
We have matching scars and pillows now. Good to see you on the mend
I am so glad you are doing well Rick. ❤
Glad you're ok Rick.  Have a speedy recovery.  Looking forward to the vids.
"Can't lift anything heavier than ten pounds, but can still play the guitar..." Not the guitar I built. I call it the "Chirocaster."
Glad to hear it was not due to "safe and effective". Keep up, Rick. The world and your audience needs you.
God bless you Rick , happy recovery ❤
I love your channel. I'm very glad you're healthy again and wish you and your family many years of joy together. Since you just went through this very big procedure that offers a chance to step back and reassess, I'd suggest asking the question I always like to ask myself, "how can I be of service?" I'm always happier when that's my focus. That said, you've pointed out a lot of shortcomings in the most popular artists' music of today. I'd love to see you show casing a completely new artist once a month or even once a week. I'll bet your viewers alone contain some great artists that you could share with the world. Anyway, I really enjoy what you do and what you have to say. Again, I'm glad you're healthy and wish you and your friends and family many years of enjoying the human experience together.
Great to have you back Rick... all the best with your ongoing recovery. ✌️
Glad all went well. Prayers for a speedy recovery! Thanks for doing what you do
Damn Rick you said 10 lbs no Les Paul playing 🤘🎸😂😂😱
Glad your surgery went well! Best wishes to you!
“You look Marvelous”. God Bless.
Good to know all is well and great to see you back.
I'm glad that your surgery went fine and you are up on your feet again that fast. Best wishes for full recovery and longevity!
Awesome that medical procedures such as yours are able to be done today ! God bless and take it easy while you recover!
You're looking good, Rick!  Take good care of yourself!  Your channel is the best thing on YouTube!
glad your ok
Glad you are doing so well Rick, and you look fantastic! I can't tell you how much joy your video's have brought me over the years.
You're only 5 years older than I am, Rick. I expect both of us to keep on keepin' on for decades to come. You never stop teaching, and I'll never stop learning.
Hey Rick - Glad to hear your surgery went well and you're on the mend. I'm 62 as well and have a Bicuspid Aortic Valve. I've been told by my cardiologist that I may or may never need surgery  for my particular condition. Of course, I'm hoping for the latter, but won't be surprised if it's the former. Thanks for posting something so personal, it means a lot. Good health to you!
Thank you for the update Rick. Glad things are going well!
Great to see you again Rick ! 🥳
Great news! You are the right person at the right time here on YT to provide and share your vast  historical, critical and theory knowledge. Wishing you many  more years and continued success.
Beato te! Wishing you a full and speedy recovery!
Glad to hear everything is ok! Please stay healthy!
Best wishes on a swift recovery Rick.
I am glad you are here to share your stories and incredible music knowledge. Much love from my family to you.
It happens. I’m 63 and last year I thought I was having a heart attack but turned out to be gallbladder. I guess we’ll all be going out with less parts than we came in with. Stay strong!
We're happy that you're healthy! We need your wonderful insight for as long as we are blessed to have it! 🙏🏽💖
Keep doing what you're doing, because I love it all! Take care of yourself, buddy!
Welcome to the zipper club.
You look, sound and emanate great!  As you say nobody would ever knew what you went through last week!!! God bless you for having so much energy and love!!! ❤❤❤
Glad you're OK Rick!
Good to hear you’re back on track and full of confidence and plans!  Concerning the future of your channel: This is your channel, Rick. Do whatever you like or find important to do.  In the best sense: listen to your heart, it will guide you! Cheers from a 62 year old from Germany…
Took me back to the time my mother had the same operation 30 years ago. Glad you are doing so well so soon.
I'm 46 and had an heart surgery 14 months ago. it took me quite awhile to move and feel "normal", about a couple of weeks I'd say. being on your feet and feeling like you've told us in the video is more than great
Hay Rick. Super glad all went well. Looking forward to many more awesome videos from you mate! Keep Well. Brad from South Africa here.
Thank God you are doing well. You take your time to completely recover. I have been a subscriber to your channel for many years and thoroughly enjoy your content. Blessings to you
I had an aortic valve replacement in 1997 when I was 22 I’ll be 49 in august and it’s still going strong and hope I can get another 27yrs out of it. But I can’t ask for to much because in 2018 I had a abdominal aortic aneurysm, it was really scary for a few days, I was awake and alert the whole time but was in the icu heart floor for about 10 days, so now I walk around with a ticking time bomb in my stomach and it can be scary some days.
Be well my friend.......
Fan of your channel. I just had my mitral valve repaired back in January at age 40. Exactly the same problem as yours, same operation. I'm glad you got through it and are doing well. I think you will find the recovery to be pretty mellow. I'm about five months post-op, and my life is basically the same. I got back into climbing and still go mountain biking. Best wishes in your recovery!
Long Life to You, Rick!
Amazing! Get well soon Rick...favourite channel, you are wonderful!!!
Thoughts and Prayers for you. Have a great recovery and a great life.
I'm so glad your operation was successful.  Tipping top of the YouTube music breakdowns. I learn a lot from you and it would be great if you could stick around awhile
Thanks for this update Rick , take care man 💝
Rick, you should write a song incorporating an amplified sound of your heartbeat or pulse. That would be really cool!
Good recovery! Even this video is inspirational. Thank you!
Glad it was all a success! ❤
Glad you're back Rick. Best wishes for your future health.
I'm very happy that everything went so well for You.  I think You're a Great Guy.  I've watched your channel for a long time.  I wish You lived near by so I could drop by and have You hear some of my stuff. I think you'd like it.
Thanks for the update Rick! So glad to hear your recovering well. I’m a 54 year old male with the same issue of mitral valve failure with regurgitation. It’s good to hear it went well and little to no pain for you. 🙏❤️❤️‍🩹
You are world treasure Rick! God bless you, greeting from a Chilean living in Sweden that follow your channel for more than 3 years 🥰
Congrats!  Medical science is miraculous.  When you and I were kids, this type of surgery would have been science fiction.  Glad to have you back and wishing you a full and complete recovery.
God bless you, Rick!
Glad you're well, Rick.  I hope you stay well for a long, long time to come.
I missed your video Rick, and I had no idea. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well... Godspeed Brotha... 👊😎🎸
Rock N Roll heart
I'm glad you're ok and I'm sorry you can't play your Les Pauls due to that weight restriction
I'm glad your recovery is going great Rick.!! Looking forward to your next videos but take it easy for now. Take care my friend.
Glad it went well..
Rick, glad to hear you are on the mend! See you at the grocery store.
You look healthy as always Rick.!! We are here here waiting to meet you and new exciting videos. 💫✌️🙏
We love u rick❤
The photo took me by complete surprise, to be honest. I'm glad the surgery went well and that you've made a complete recovery. Keep rockin'!
Rick since Chris Cornell has turned 60 yrs old this past July 20th and we Miss Him so much..could you do a series of videos on him? Something From the beginning of his career until his solo stuff? Thanx ! Because "no one sings like u anymore " CHRIIIIIIIIIS! ❤
glad it went well.
Hey Rick, glad to hear you are on the mend. Don’t be tempted to pick up one of your Les Pauls because you may be in violation of that 10 pound limit.  Be well.
So glad to hear you're in good health Rick! Keep the interviews commin' !!!
I greatly enjoy your interviews for two reasons - your great selection of artists that you interview, and your interview style.  You have a great way of letting the artist reveal things without interrupting them.  And your insightful questions are spot on.  P.S. So glad your procedure went smoothly.
Wishing you a speedy recovery! I have Mitral Valve Prolapse too.Glad your back at the guitar and you seem to be doing ok, stay well 🫶
Glad you are well. Thank you for all that you do.
Just thanks for sharing your experience Rick, that's my thought for now. Get perfectly fit soon and then you can start thinking about what direction must the channel take ❤
Heal well!
Thank God for good doctors! Glad you’re doing well.   For videos, I’d love to see you compare western pop to Japanese pop music! J-pop is one of my favorite genres, and i’ve always thought it was generally better than a lot of western pop nowadays, so it would be interesting to hear your thoughts on it! Specifically songs like Idol by YOASOBI or songs by Midnight Grand Orchestra are some of my favorites
Glad you're up and at 'em again Rick!
Sorry to hear that you had this issue but very glad that it went well and you're feeling better. All the best.
Be well sir.
We really appreciate you Rick! Very glad you are fine. Amazing though that you can go through such an intrusive surgery and be up and about so soon. For the next year, just keep doing as you are doing. Love the variety of videos. Interviews, your thoughts on the industry, song breakdowns. I think the main thing is what you are interested in is the way to go.
❤ awesome that the surgery went well, Rick 😊 For me, your arpeggio shorts have been my faves for a while. Thank you so much for sharing your wealth of knowledge 🎉🎉🎉
To great health! Take care of yourself !
Best wishes from Lanarkshire, Scotland Rick. God bless you and keep you safe. Thank you.
Glad you are well Rick!! I can hear your breathing sound like someone in recovery but not weak at all, your sentences seem shorter before taking a breath. But otherwise you look great!
Good to go for another 62 years
Keep that beat going, Rick! Wish you the best from Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world.
Wish you the best man! Keep up your great work❤
Bless your heart!!! I'm very content to know you're out of the woods as far as the operation goes. Surgery is no joke, it's terrifying. Thank you for your progress update and all that you do that speaks to so many people who are in love with music, equally, in love with you. All my best! mr.del_mar
So Gad you’re ok, Rick.
More interviews!  Glad you’re ok Rick!
So grateful for you & your channels! Happy you're okay 🙏♥️ Keep Rockn' Rick 🎸🎶
I'm glad you're better. I was overweight and would feel faint when I stood up after bending, turns out I have a leaky valve. I also have family history of heart disease, my doc said not to worry about it yet. I did Keto, lost a few pounds and felt better.
Congrats on a successful surgery! Good time to do a review of Olivia Newton John's song,  " Heart Attack ".  You are a champ !
Pleased to hear you're fine now.
Good news that you were able to get it fixed. Cleveland Clinic is the absolute best. They treated my son who is also doing well since having surgery there.
Glad to hear all went well and wishing you a full recovery. Thanks for the update.
Rick, great to see you're back at it. Will keep you in my prayers for sure 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
My daughter had heart surgery when she was 4 weeks old. Has to have another when she's 9 (she's 8 now) sending all the best...Lee from the UK
I have learned so much over the years by watching your channel and really appreciate your making the content that you do. Please take good care of yourself.
I'm so happy you're recovering well. Stay strong!
When I was a child my single parent mother always took me to *bad* surgeons. Because she was always broke and couldn't afford good ones.  Now that I'm older I take myself to good Surgeons at Mayo Clinic. Big difference.  Glad you got your body fixed Rick. And in time too. May you rock on, you music genius you, for many years to come.  For me personally getting my soul repaired one time had greater value then getting this temporary body of mine fixed many times.  Anyway,  Les Pauls are pretty heavy you might want to take a break from them for a day or two. Cheers and God Bless you! 😊🙏
Don't lift anything over ten pounds, then stay away from certain Les Paul guitars hehe. Hope your recovery continues to go well!
But did you go mechanical or pig valve. I'm looking at this too at some time in the future. If mechanical, are you on warfarin?
1. I'm so glad to hear your operation went well and that you're having a smooth recovery. I had heart surgery at birth, and I know that even though it's becoming routine it's still scary for you and your family. So glad all is well in that regard!   2. I would love to see you break down more classic funk/rnb/soul music. I'd love you to analyze Tower of Power's horn section/arrangements, discuss their role in the recording industry. I'd love to hear you analyze some of Sly Stone's material, and maybe some Motown or Muscle Shoals recordings. Thanks for everything!
Only better place to go is the Mayo Clinic (biased since I work there....lol).  Actually for heart - Cleveland Clinic is ranked #1 so good choice.
Glad it worked out well, and you're still full of energy!
Glad you’re doing well, Rick! These are the moments we come face to face with our own mortality. Praying for you, and that this takes you on a rewarding journey like Russell Brand’s. ❤ it’s a big universe and there’s a lot of layers. Kinda like a peanut parfait. Or an onion. 😉
So glad you decided to do this.   My mom put it off for too long.  We lost her in 2005.   Glad it's all good for you and your fam!
Hey Rick. Welcome to the "zipper chest club". Glad you're doing well. Keep up the GREAT work.
Glad you’re on the mend.
Really appreciate your work Rick, it’s amazing. Really appreciate your honesty… also amazing 👍
Doctor’s orders… no Heavy Metal for now, or ‘Heavy’ by Collective Soul. Only light rock for now.   Let this event be a lesson to folks who do not know the damaging FX of bad music and what it does to your heart (& soul).   Prayers continue for you and your family, Rick. Keep on keeping’ on!
Nice to hear an update Thank you  Personally I would like to hear more song breakdowns A lot of the interviews don’t strike a chord with me
Sir, I wish you the best.  Speedy recovery!  🙏🏽
👍🙏♥️
All the Best Rick 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Glad you're on this side of it!
Thank you, Rick! I'm glad you're doing well. You're a gem to the world of music.
Wishing you all the best in your recovery!
RIP Rick , my mother was die, no video or fans on, ok dude. We all die, no need to complain, health problems are for your family
And you didn’t do a show from the RnR HoF?
Great to hear your surgery went well and you are good to go for the duration. While I do value your instructional videos, there are a lot of others out there that do this - although not as well. NOBODY gets the interviews you get and asks the questions you ask. You ask questions and drive the conversations like I wish everyone else would. No wasted air. No softball filler - all insightful and interesting. I also really enjoy when you take a deep dive into a song or an album. More than once, a song that I didn't give a second thought to becomes very important and interesting. Again, Godspeed with your recovery. I'm with you for the long haul - whatever direction you want to go with the channel.
I hope you'll be fit again all the way soon. As to your videos i think you're a great interviewer, so you should keep doing it. I also like the song breakdowns and reactions though, so i guess a mix of all is fine. But it all depends if i'm interested in the song or he person. Oh and i also liked you visiting that guitar shop a lot. Not so much the dialogue with the haters.
get well rick! you're one of a kind
Very glad you are on the mend! God Bless!
I'm glad you did well, Mr Beato, your channel is one of the best, if not the best in YouTube, top aesthetics and ethos, keep going!
Glad you are ok !
Went trough a triple bypass last April....Its tough! Fast recovery and you look amazing after a open chest surgery!!!! I still feel pains.
Wishing you well dude
Hey Rick, I had the exact same surgery (Mitral Valve Repair) back in September of 2022.  My surgery went great as well.  Glad you're healing quickly!
Happy you're doing so well, Rick. This is by far the best channel for interviews so...
I recently saw Echo in the canyon (2018) about Laurel canyon where the Beach boys, The Byrds and The Mamas and the papas among others used to live and I was thankful that they made that film while they could still do those interviews with amongst others Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Michelle Phillips and Tom Petty while they were still alive (which Tom wasn't when the film premiered). I'm glad you are doing interviews with people like Björn Ulvaeus and Larry Carlton that are no longer spring chickens.
Congratulations. Great news.
Glad you’re doing well! Thanks so much for your channel
I really like the interviews. Would love one with Ichika Nito.
Get Well! What Museums? See anything good?
Glad you're doing well, man!!! 👍😎💪👏👏
God Bless you & your family Rick. And thank you for all you do here on YouTube !! Much love brother...
Glad you are well! I guess no Les Paul's for you for the next couple of weeks.
I grew up in Churchville... Class of 85... So glad to have found your channel back in 2020.   Even more glad to hear that God has blessed you and l'm so looking forward to watching you for many more years to come.  Rock on!
All the best Rick and having a great recovering 👍🏻
Very happy to hear that your surgery was so successful. Your color looks brighter.  fwiw, I kinda dig scars, so if you ever get the compulsion to show yours... I'm in. P.S. I've seen folks get that admonition to not do heavy lifting for weeks after a surgery. Inevitably, every single one of them does themself a serious damage by ignoring that order.  So NO Heavy Lifting for YOU!
Glad your still here and healthy now
Aw you look amazing considering open heart surgery. Thank goodness you’re okay. ❤
Blessings stay well.
Great news Rick.... It's amazing that you can be back to normal so quickly.
Glad you're on the mend. My mom had the same thing. Mitral stenosis. Kudos for getting it fixed. 👍
God glasse you man!
Glad your are well and through your surgery!   Love your channel and the positivity you bring to the world!   🎵 ❤️ ❤️‍🩹
Rick, I'm happy that you are doing well. Blessings and take care!
❤
Glad you are doing well! Excellent update by the way!
So happy for you Rick. We need you, get some rest.
Welcome back Rick. Take care of your health and everything else is secondary.
God bless your heart, Rick!!
Glad to hear you are making a good recovery. Best wishes for your future and looking forward to the new videos.
I enjoy what you do so much and admire your ability to build such a respectful following among some of the greatest musicians of our time, so happy it turned out well and I look forward to more of your insightful interviews where you ask all the right the questions. Best of luck Rick from Halifax Nova Scotia. Cheers
OMG Rick, just saw this. So glad you’re doing well. Take care of yourself and I’ll keep,you in my prayers. 🙏  BTW, you know that question some people ask, “If you could spend one hour having a conversation with anyone, who would it be.” Well, you are one of the people I would choose. I love all kinds of music and I think our conversation would be simply amazing.
Glad to hear you’re doing well! I’d love to see more song breakdowns, I’ve found many hidden gems because of them (e.g., Amsterdam by Coldplay)
Rick be healthy. Love your work🙏
As a retired Respiratory Therapist who is a Cardiopulmonary specialist, I was interested in your update! This is my area of expertise,  but I enjoy your area of expertise! Glad it was a text book fix! Now do a breakdown on Roxette 's song, "Listen to your Heart!" Lol!😂
You’re one of the good guys Rick x
One of life's gentlemen. Get well soon my friend
It is soooooo good that everything went well! Glad to hear you are well!
Love you, Rick! Thank you to the good doctors who are looking out for our man, Rick.
Love you, Rick!
Glad you're doing well!  I live in Cleveland so you should have stopped by.  :)
Very best to you Rick, love from Northern Ireland.
Dang, glad to hear you are through the operation and on the recovery path. Keep on keeping us informed, educated and amused!
We are all humans. Makes you enjoy life much more, carpe diem. Have the best recovery !
They stop and bypass your heart. Yup, didn't need to know that. Glad it worked out.
Glad everything went well. Take care.
Glad it went ok Rick and you’re obviously on a high.
Glad you're ok!
This man must be protected at all costs.
Glad you're convalescing successfully, Rick. You're a treasure. I love your musical instruction via hit songs as examples, your interviews with amazing musicians, and your song lists (especially those that expose the atrocious elements that have darkened our world). Your knowledge of chords and chord progressions, modulations, good songwriting versus mediocre and formulaic stuff is refreshing. If there are people in this world who are preparing us all for a much-needed musical renaissance, you are easily among the most qualified among them. Thank you for all you do.
I'm glad it was a success and glad you're in good health rick.
Ok. So no picking up a Les Paul without weight relief for a while 😊
Get well soon!  15 years ago, through testing (I was 40) they discovered that I was born with a hole in my heart (common) but the hole was 2 inches across and they had no idea how I was functioning one day let alone 40 years.  I had open heart surgery, woke with the silver "zipper" down my chest, and was given 10 years left to live since the repair happened after so many years of "abuse" to the heart.  Well, It is now creeping in on the 15 th year, and yeah, I have slowed down, but I am still up and about most days.  Stay strong brother!
Rick, I love your musician interviews and would love to hear more!
Glad you're back and doing well, regardless of your channel or otherwise
Rick! thanks for sharing your experience and how you are doing! Take care and so much love to you!
that's great to hear from you, Rick! Glad to know you're doing good and looking forward to what's coming next :))
I'm so happy that you have come through your surgery with great success.  Many blessings to you and a quick recovery.
Dam you were in my neighborhood
Glad to hear you are doing well after surgery. Good thing you can still play guitar during the healing process!
Thank God you're on the mend. God bless those amazing surgeons!
I'm in the similiar boat, I have moderate leakage of mitral valve, I also have A-fib (irreg. heartbeat). Often dizzy and really tired...I thought that it was maybe from my medications but it must be from the heart valve!
One thing I would love is to hear you play more.  Glad you are better.
Good to see you doing well Rick. I had my mitral valve repaired 3 or so years ago with open heart surgery and I was on my feet the next morning (gingerly) and just on Tylenol for pain the second afternoon. Pretty amazing things they can do..
Rick, I've only known about you for a short time, but I love your in-depth interviews. Wishing you a speedy recovery, we need you buddy!
Hope and blessings to you, Rick.  🎸 ❤
Wishing you well Rick. Best wishes
🤗🩷🤗
Glad you are doing so well!❤
Good to hear! God Save you…
Welcome back as they say. Its great that you'll still be around and will be for the foreseeable future. Cheers, applause and  smiles all round.
all the best to you.
glad to see you're doing well. Take care.
Good luck Mr Beato . my favourite videos are  when you just sat round chatting with your mates about guitars and stuff , they must be easier and cheaper to make as well.
Awesome - thank you for sharing this, Rick.
So glad to hear you’re feeling great and the surgery was a success! Keep providing your excellent musical content.
We love you Rick!!! So glad your surgery went great!!! I am 52 and had a pacemaker put in in 2017. I had the same deal, Mitro Valve prolapse, but I let I got and now here I am. I think your next breakdown should be involving the heart, like…Tom Petty and the…or songs that have heart in them. Corny I know but just a suggestion? Anyway love your videos!!
The doctor says not to lift more than 10lbs, so how are you supposed to pee?
Glad you made it through with flying colors!
Glad you're doing well!  I wish you a speedy full recovery!  "Not heavier than 10lbs" means no Les Pauls for a bit, though! 😄
It is scary but also amazing how medicine has progressed.   Glad you are ok and praying that everything continues to go well.
So glad you're doing well. Speedy recovery to you.
Glad things went well from Geneva ny.
This is so cool...it is amazing how this surgery is done now and how fast the recovery is if you are healthy. So glad you are feeling great and you got it fixed. Here is to 62 more years...I will be watching!
Welcome back, Rick.  You look GREAT!
Very happy you are doing well. Prayers for successful recovery!
Glad you are doing well Rick!
Fantastic that your recovery is going so well.❤
Speedy recovery Rick!
Hey Rick, I hope you recover quickly. Thank you for being open and transparent with such a topic!
Hey Rick! Glad you’re on the mend 👍. I had triple bypass 4 yrs ago and totally get the big old scar!❤️‍🩹
Glad you're on the mend Rick
So glad you are ok! Really love your channel
So glad you are doing well. You look great!
Dear Rick, I‘m so happy that all went well. Wish you nothing but the best for your wellbeing. Be safe and healthy, kindest regards from Germany.
Rick, best wishes. I always look forward to everything on your channel and your great musical insight - but that pales in comparison to my looking forward to your complete recovery.
@RickBeato, if you have the chance to read this; first, congrats. Second, my mom had heart surgery at Cleveland Clinic with a very long surgery for some rare things that's hard to explain. Her surgeon explained to her that any heart surgery you have has a 'lifespan' and you want to wait for as long as possible to avoid ever doing it again. My mom waited 12 years from a starting point of 'should be within 3 years. So, she's been there. Feels great and great staff up there!
I'm soo glad that you did recover really well and are back in fine form - just love all the videos I've seen from you over the past couple of years, Rick! Keep up with your great work!!!
Since you asked, would love a few more WMTSG where you're able to show the actual stems. Cheers!
Glad to see your surgery was a success. Get well soon and keep up the good work!
Blessings
Glad you are back🤗
Stay strong Rick, I had a double bypass in January 2021 after suffering a mild heart attack at 54 and have felt great ever since. Love the channel and keep up the great work
Glad you’re doing well.
Wow! I would never had guessed.  At 61, I have had a number of lengthy operations on my neck and lower spine, and while I would say “if you don’t need to have an operation, don’t have it”, I would also say “have any necessary operation as young as possible, while a young body can take it and recover easier”.  I’m just glad that the doctors saw this as a “routine” operation, and that you are recovering.  Wishing you a speedy recovery and many blessings.
Medical science is amazing!!!  All the best to you sir.  I love what you do!!  ✌️❤️🎶🎶🎶
It's just wonderful to hear how well you are doing Rick. You are in my prayers! Would never have known you had any health issue at all. Thank you for all you share annular perspectives on life and music! I've been down the cancer path twice and I understand that we pause to think, reframe life and priorities whenever something like this gets our attention! Be healthy my friend and thank you for all you share!
🙌🏽💗🙌🏽💗🙌🏽💗🙌🏽💗
Rick was about 40 miles from me there at the hospital. Ohio has problems, but world-class Cleveland Clinic isn't one of them. Glad you are fine, "Uncle" Rick.
Did they give you a video of your op? 😊
Wishing you all the best Rick - keep up the great show.  I love the interviews especially when the artists play some songs.
Please continue "What Makes This Song Great" but with weekly polls! It would also be cool to have users enter their choices into the poll too, in case Rick missed a popular one =). But I guess this depends on if Rick can get stems for the songs too.
Congratulations on the successful surgery. May God continue to bless you and keep you well.
encouraging to hear your surgery went so well!!
Glad you’re doing well Rick! I appreciate everything you do for music education.   As for thoughts on the channel… I really like your song breakdowns. They’ve really helped me develop as a songwriter! I’d love to see more
glad you're feeling good, Rick. All the best.
Glad you're doing well! 🤟
Glad you're making a speedy recovery, Rick! My only wish for video content from you would be "What WOULD Make This Song Great" where semi-pros send you tracks and you can critique them with theory, arrangement advice, mixing/mastering advice. I think lots of people might find that fascinating, but maybe wouldn't want to tune in to listen to unknown songs. 😞In any case, if you have any interest in trying this, I have lots of cool tracks that could use some expert advice! Mostly real instruments!
AI tried to kill you and you survived.
First and foremost, happy that you’re healthy and feeling great. Secondly about your channel, I love the mix of what you’re doing. The song breakdowns are great. LOVE your interviews. What about a history of rock series from the 50s on and the trends and direction of the music as it evolved. You and I can discuss a royalty fee in private for the AMAZING idea.   I don’t know man. You keep coming up with better ideas as you go. Can’t wait to see what you come up with next.
You are great man and I am really fond of you. My heart stopped for 28 minutes when I was only 31 years old and after six years I still have not fully mentally recovered from that. Great inspiration!
Looks like you can still keep a beat!!  😅 ❤
Welcome to the zip club Rick , we’ve been zipped open , and closed, had your heart taken out your body, handled by another human ( surgeon ) now is a good time to do a stock take of all the important things in your life , and focus on them !! Thank the Lord daily for His mercies and for life, you only live once !!  Regards Jonathan ( also a zip club member 🎉) South Africa 🇿🇦
Snap. Had same surgery in April. Glad you are ok.
❤❤❤
So glad to see you are so nicely on the mend. I wish you a speedy recovery and seeing you here let's us know your recovery is well on the way. Best to you always Rick.
I'm really glad that everything went well, Rick. I love your videos and your personality!
Me alegro que tú operación haya salido bien, un abrazo desde Argentina, cuídate Rick!!❤
Hey Rick....glad to hear you are recovering well.  I had an aortic aneurysm.  ,  behind my stomach.  Same deal. Kept an eye on it for 5 years   They watched it grow in size. When it reached 5.5 centimeters,,  it was time for surgery.  All went well and recovered in about 30 days fully.
I am surprised you are out and around after a week, that surgery will knock your ass down pretty hard,  plus there must be physical therapy  to get your strength back. I had a aortic valve replacement , I have a artificial heart valve now and I was in the hospital 6 days and then another week of physical therapy in a facility. Maybe the Mitral valve is easier I don't know  but they do stop your heart and place you on a heart and lung machine for the duration of the surgery. They have to lower your body temp also to do that and it's a tricky step when they go to restart your heart as they have to warm you up again and the timing of that is critical as most cardiologist say that everyone experiences some minor brain damage most of it is tied to memory issues but it happens in all patients most don't notice it.
Well done Rick! I also have a heart problem and had a stroke about 7 years ago. It is amazing what they can do today… Thank God!❤
THEY TURNED YOU OFF AND YOU DIDN'T GET A HENDRIX INTERVIEW??????
Good health to you Rick!
God Bless! I am glad the surgery was successfull
Glad you are feeling better
I am so happy to hear you are doing well. May you enjoy a speedy recovery and many healthy years to come. Thank you for all you do for our music community.
Thats great!  My mom needs to get a valve replacement and this makes me feel better about her.
Get well soon again, precious Rick! Praying for a quick and lasting recovery. Love and blessings from Germany
Best of luck. I have the same scar which I got June 10.
It's been a month since my Aortic Valve replacement. Enjoy all the moments your amazing doctors have given you!!
Congrats on your Mitral Valve repair!!  Welcome back to great health!!!  God bless, Rick!!
So glad to see you well, Overcome and completely silent now, With heaven's help You cast your demons out
I am actually getting cardiac ablation done myself two days from now.  So glad to hear you are doing great!
Glad to see you are recovering well!!
Glad to hear that you are doing OK after the surgery, Rick!
Glad to hear you're doing well, Rick! Wishing you a swift recovery!
So glad to hear you're recovering well, Rick. For god's sake, take care of yourself. You have no idea how much you are loved and respected.
I am glad your surgery went well.  Having the type of procedure is scary.  I hope you have a complete recovery
ALL THE BEST,  DEAR RICK. NOW BACK TO MUSIC !
❤👍🏼
Rick: may God heal you completely from the top of your head to soles of your feet!  take care
Hello Rick, wanted to write all the time, but didn't till now. Nothing special I can say, you know it all already, but still: there is one more elderly man very far away from you for whom listening and watching you is pure joy - like talking to an old friend. Take care, and stay healthy! Love from 🇬🇪
Glad to hear you're on the mend!
I'm 58 and have the same issue and the surgery is inevitable for me as well. Love the song breakdowns and all you do. It's been a real eye opener and learning tool for me after playing instruments for nearly 50 years. THANK YOU! Most importantly, take it easy and know that we are sending our love and best wishes, brother.❤
I am glad that you are well. I am 71 and am seeing father time vividly, We are these ephemeral beings. Love your self, love your family and understand the purely natural experience we all go though. Ad Astra!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had mine done 19 years ago, the surgeon used keyhole surgery through the right side of my chest, so no groovy scar, but I have had 19 years of productive life and I am grateful for every day. Hang in there, my brother in mitral valve surgery, and know that you are here for a reason.
I’d love to see a long video breakdown of the Hagar Era of Van Halen
So glad it was successful!
Best wishes to you and yours. Minimizing a procedure like that is better for recovery. Good thing you have good medical care here on the US where it can be a real crapshoot and/or red tape the rest of the world doesn't have.
I am super happy to hear that everything went smooth Rick 🎉❤, God bless you and your family and give you many more years. 🙏🏼
Rock on Ricky! Rock on❤
Glad you are well!!
All the best to you and your family, have a speedy recovery. you are loved🤘❤🤘
Rick, glad for the news of your good health! As for the future of the Channel, I think many of us would love to see you check out some of the more artistic/less overtly commercial new music outside of the top charts— your followers have sooo many recommendations I’m sure.
Glad you’re doing well Rick! Keep it up!
Hi Rick, so happy that you‘re up and running again😂. No seriously, I‘m very glad, that your surgery went so well and that you can enjoy us with your amazing videos for many more years.
You’re one of the bright spots in the whole YouTube world and will be a dark day when you stop posting these entertaining and educational videos. I’m glad the surgery went well and you’re on top of taking care of yourself. I hope this means you have many more long and healthy years ahead of you to spend time with those you love.
So good to see you doing so well Rick. It’s now behind you & you’re going to go from strength to strength. Much love & good wishes from Ireland 👍👍
agree with all the other well wishers in the comments Rick... just continue getting stronger and keep doing what you are doing...
I'm glad it went well Rick.  You and your channel are the number 1s on youtube for me.  Hope you have a speedy recovery mate.
Thank the good Lord above the surgery was a success, you’re healthy and on the road to recovery. Don’t know what we would do without your videos. I would love to see more what makes a song great videos, and your top 10s are awesome. God Bless!
Rick stay healthy because we need you for President!
We love you, Nick. Get better very soon! Zs
Hey Rick wish you all the best! Keep the great work!
I see you as an advocate for “real” music Rick… Just make whatever videos you enjoy doing and we’ll keep watching!
Wow! Awesome!
Gob Bless You Rick!  Prayers and wishes for a continued quick recovery!
Good good good!! Great news, Mr. B.  Off topic: Just watched Dust Radio last night.  A film about Chris Whitley. I'd be curious to hear your take on Chris.   Continued good health, sir.
Jeez Rick glad you’re ok and doing well. The world would be a lesser place without you.
Change your diet. Meat is listed as a carcinogen
wish you a fast recovery, what was the music you listened in recovery ..?
Rick, I'm so glad your surgery went well, and your recovery is going smoothly!  On the channel, I would love to see more videos on good new (and/or newer) artists whom you like.  Your recent video on contemporary female indie-rock artists was wonderful.  It didn't get the views that it should have, but I loved it.  Of course, I love your videos on classic artists too, but I especially appreciate your thoughts on great new artists!
Wishing you well Rick! TY for the great content!
Glad you got your surgery Rick.  Hope you’re feeling better for it 🙏🏼
Get well soon Rick ❤
Happy to hear your success with resolving this health issue.
Love you, man.
Well now that's the best news today. Good to hear and thanks from Portugal for the update.  Dates and almonds are good for you you know 🤗 just saying. See you next 👍🌴💦🦤
Wishing you a very speedy recovery Rick, so glad to see you doing so well. Cheers, Paul from Montreal.❤
Wish you speedy recovery
Don't pick up one of your 70s Les Pauls! Glad you're taking care of yourself. The channel has been great. Your song vids and interviews are fantastic. I dunno. Maybe do what you enjoy most and we'll probably enjoy what that will be.
Stay healthy mate!
Thanks, Rick, for sharing the details.  Keep up the good work you've been doing and God bless you, sir. 🙏
Glad to hear they were able to get the surgery done successfully. Hopefully it will mean many more years of Beato wisdom for the world.
❤Glad it went well and you’re doing great.
Glad to see your recovery is good Rick, God bless you Sir.
You look good,  Rick. I'm glad the surgery is behind you and that you are doing well. Wishing you a rapid and complete recovery. Keep up the good work!
I live here in Cleveland Rick the Clinic saved my life man they are the best in the world glad you're feeling better, and the show is amazing, and it just keeps getting better.
So glad you had a great outcome!  I assume you got a Carpentier ring  as part of the repair.  When you are 90 you will look back and marvel and thank the powers that be that there was a fix for your mitral valve.  You look great…a wee bit thinner which suits you well.  All best wishes to you, Nina and the kids.
Hey, Rick! Want you to know I’m equipped with an artificial mitral valve! It’s been running my body since 2003! Working in music is hard when health gets in the way. I’m down myself waiting for a bowel abscess to heal up, but I know if my not-quite-there skills will continue, I know you will be 100% soon! Love ya, bro, and God bless ya!
Double bypass patient here.  I can’t offer much advice, because you seem to be recovering faster than I did!
That's super serious and heavy Rick. Glad the surgery was successful. I had a heart procedure (catheter ablation), which, long story short wasn't the greatest and put me through all kinds of hell, but you had OPEN HEART surgery, which is much more serious, so I can't imagine how that must feel now that you're out and recovering. Any time they're dealing with the heart, it's serious. You don't look like someone who just had open heart surgery! Stay safe.
Great to see you back!
Yeah 🎉O2!!!❤
Super happy you’re feeling good Rick! I look forward to more videos in the future. As far as recommendations for videos moving forward I think you should jump back into some top 10 or top 20 list. I’ve always been curious your take on the top songs with no drums. Here’s to good health in the future.
Just wondering did you bring a play list for them?  If I am coming out of this you need to avoid anything with AutoTune.
Thank you for the update! Glad you are well and hope you take it easy on yourself-you are loved and appreciated by so many! Thanks for what you do and more importantly thanks for being the genuinely good person that you are.
So glad to hear you are recovering very well! :)
Great job, Rick. Glad you’re feeling better
Glad your surgery went well! I'd love more song breakdowns, always love those
Great to see you back and better than ever!!!
Nothing over 10 pounds.... NO LES PAULs!!!!!!!
Have a good recovery buddy. Nice to see you in that mode. I used to be an anestheshia nurse in cardiac op room. I participated as a team member in dozens open heart surgery operations. I never saw or met a single patient afterwards. You kind of bring the good news that it was worth work there. Thanks.
Hope you continue a good recovery Rick!😉💪🏼
We love you ❤❤❤❤. Glad everything went well,  Rick.
Heal up quick Rick. Good luck for a speedy recovery.
I'm so glad everything went well with your surgery, and your recovery is going well.
Thank you for sharing your health experiences.  This can be really helpful for others going through similar issues.  You look like you’re doing great already ❤. Looking forward to more interviews as well as song breakdowns.  Those are my favorite things as well as music theory.  Have you interviewed Nile Rodgers, J Mascis or Mark Knopfler? Those would be my top guitarists.
I`m not a regular follower of your channel. I`m 64 and I hope my heart is in good condition. It was a queasy kind of feeling to hear about your heart surgery. Somehow you never think that someone that you see regulary on the screen and who appears to be so lively could suffer a severe malady.  I hope that the surgery was succsessfull and that your channel will remains with us for another long time.  I wish you a speedy recovery.   All the best from Germany
I have had issues with MVP also… it sucks.  Here’s to your rehab Rick!
Great that all went well and that you're in good health again Rick.
It's those strong Italian genes, ciao
❤
My only suggestion for the channel is you do plenty of whatever you enjoy and invite us along for the fun.
Great, man!
Glad to see you doing ok!
Everything you've done to this point has been stellar. Take this channel anywhere you feel necessary. We're along for the ride wherever you take us.
My heart surgery fixed my attitude! I should be dead and I'm now in perfect health. Every day is a bonus from here on.
God bless Rick and your family may god keep you well
The direction of the channel is a-ok.  With you at the helm, steady as she goes.  🛶
Glad the surgery was a success.  I love your interview videos.  The one with Ed Roland is one of my faves!
“I’m usually very energetic!” says the man whose legs can’t keep still even when he’s interviewing music stars! No excrement, Victorian detective with a magnifying glass…
Get well soon!
Get better old dude!
Thankful you got the timing right for the valve work, Rick and thrilled it is working!   Be patient with the ups and downs of the healing process, you'll make it!!
Rick do you have an aortic bicuspid valve?
Glad everything went well and see you back batter than ever!!🎉
Cleveland Clinic is the best! Glad you’re doing well. I guess with the ten pound lifting restriction you need to be careful which Les Pauls you play.
Long live rick
Glad to hear it went well.  I had the exact same surgery in June 2018 at the age of 51.  Found during my annual physical.  I had mine done by an expert on Mitral Valve repair at the University of Michigan Medial Center.   If it was repaired (like mine), I don't even see a cardiologist any longer.  I just take 1 baby aspirin about every other day.   The cardiologist joked that the repair will last longer than I will !  Keep up all the great videos...
Wishing you lots of love Rick ❤
One of next topics? Do we have valid/confirmed scientific research(es) on how (which type of) music influences personal development? Then... Do personality  traits (and which ones) make person gravitate to this, or that type of music? About how social environment influences musical taste we hear you lament often enough. ;)
As a lifelong Clevelander, thank you for the comments about my hometown.  I'm glad it all went well for you but know the Cleveland Clinic does fine work.
Glad to hear & see you are on the mend. Looking forward to your new videos. ❤️🇮🇪🇪🇺🥂
I'm astonished. Both about the long wait before the operation as well as the extremely short recovery time. My daughter (1st year medical student) diagnosed my mitral severe regurgitation and after the necessary positive tests I am awaiting surgery. It does me well to see you like this after one week Rick!
You are an absolute walking legend, Rick. Stay well!
I'm so happy for you! Enjoy your renewed boundless energy.
Glad you are well Rick! Keep on tickin' :)
Glad it went so well! Wishing you the best of recoveries, Rick!
@0:56  Cardiologists are like that, yes they are.   Many of them have absolutely NO sense of humor.  Only 1 of the 3 that I've had could appreciate a joke.
Be well!
Can't wait for more from you!
I offer my most sincere good wishes for the future Rick.  I've been enjoying your YouTube channel for a few years now and look forward to seeing many more years of your excellent content.
As someone born with a heart problem that needs surgery every 10-15 years (I've had 3 so far in 28 years). I'm happy it went well and welcome to the cool-scar-on-chest club!
Incredible! And i'm imagining you waking up saying "Hello Cleveland!" Be well!
❤ get well back again as you are a treasure for us rockers
Glad all went well!!
Glad you’re doing well Rick !!  Looking forward to many more years of your channel and musical insights !  🤘🏼🎸
Happy it went well sir!
glad you are ok
Get well soon, it's great that you're back in good health. I wish you healthy days in the coming days. To more beautiful videos...
Good to see your health is on the upswing. I have friends who had great success with Clevland Clinic.
Do you have to take blood thinners now? Godspeed, my friend.
Glad things went well!
Thanks, I am pleased you are getting better. Take good care of yourself. The channel is great. Love the interviews & anything music related!
An outstanding update, Rick!
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick.  Best wishes for your continued recovery.
Espero que te recuperes pronto Rick,
Love your interviews but what makes this song great are my favs
Man, all the best to you. I guess all the bad modern pop music struck a bad chord in your heart... gotta forget that crap and focus on good music. Cheers
So glad you're feeling good and on the mend! Glad you can still play guitar.  A Les Paul may be pushing that 10 lb limit!
Best wishes!
Good to see here in your studio ! 😻
Cleveland Rocks. Well they once rocked, when they were the Indians, now they're Guardians. Major League was a fun movie. Giv'em the Heater Ricky....
Get well soon and steady, please!  We need sound brains and hearts in music!
Wow..Take it easy and play that guitar !!! 🙂
Glad your ticker is OK..... Now maybe you can play in time again😂😂😂😂 j\k.  big fan.
I'm thrilled you feel so much better. God bless.
Hang in there, Rick. Thanks so much for all you've done to move the conversation about music forward.
God has blessed you Rick with many attributes, & now has prolonged your life for you to continue being a blessing to your viewers. Thank you Lord Jesus for Rick & for life.
I'm so glad you're ok. The Cleveland Clinic is the best heart hospital in the world.  My friend had the same surgery (locally) only it was botched and he flat lined on the operating table. He was only 57.   From what I heard the sugeon was responsible for 4 other deaths and needless to say the hospital fired him. Much love your way and hoping for a full recovery so you can get back to the things you love. ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🎸🎸🎸🎹🎹🎹
I'm grateful that you breezed through that medical procedure, Rick! I have no advice to give you on your channel programming other than, keep doing what you're doing! You're a national treasure, Rick!
👍🏻
So what finally made your cardiologist quit stalling and schedule you for corrective surgery? Asking for a friend.
I was born with mitral valve prolapse..was not diagnosed till 1977 I don't have the resources to have the surgery you had...glad to know your doing well.
Great to see you're doing fine, mate!  May you keep on rocking for many decades to come!!
Great to hear Rick.  I understand the new valve comes with a 80k mile warranty.
Happy to hear you're recovering well. Take care!
Please take it easy now Rick, life is magical and we are all happy to wait a bit for your incredible work. So you have to come first now. with love from Liverpool
Take care of yourself Rick (actually, you are doing just that)! You are not only a national treasure, you're an international one! Greetings, best wishes and thank you from Italy!!!❤
Get well soon..💪
I have a leaky heart valve too! I am happy that you had a successful surgery. Mick Jagger also had his heart valve replaced. I am due surgery but not until later-in-life! Glad this was successful and great to see it being preached openly in public by yourself! Best-of-luck!
Great news, we can't lose you!!
Glad your ok man
Get well rick, regards from Mexico
Rick for president!!
Glad everything went well. We need you Rick! <3
Hey Rick, love your channel. Glad you're feeling well after the surgery. I would love to see some where are they now videos of musicians who had success in the past but the success has worn off and they are no longer "mainstream" & what is life like now & what has spotify done to them financially. Ie Sugar Ray, Counting Crows, Go West, Roxette,  Jewel, Martika, Rick Astley  Etc..
I hope you get a fully recover Rick, I follow you from Mexico,
I'm glad you are alive and well.
🙏
Hey Rick!  God bless you and so happy to know you’re mending. Love the content, but heal up really well first.  We’ll be here to watch when you’re back to 💯  I would like to see a breakdown or interview with Jefferson Starship. “Jane”_ is next level !!
all the best for You
Cardio problems myself, partially blocked coronary artery, I know the fatigue thing. Keep going mate, great channel.
Glad everything went well, Rick! Regarding the channel, my favorite stuff is "What Makes This Song Great". Your breakdowns and analysis are always fun and educational.
Bless you, Rick!
If you can't lift anything over 10lbs you'd better leave those Les Pauls on the rack.
Glad you're doing well Rick. I'm on your side.
Happy to see the heart of rock and roll is still beating!
Godspeed!!  Rick!!
Rest up, Rick!
Rick, glad to hear you’re successfully recovering! Sad to hear that you had to go through this. Wish I would’ve known you were in town and could’ve tuned you into the local scene. Take care of yourself and looking forward to another year ahead of top tier material 👍
glad you're good!! much love! more "what makes this song great" and interviews... obviously!
Welcome back, Rick! So glad the surgery went well! 😎👍
Glad to see your health is back on track. 🙂🙏
Glad you're doing well, Rick! Keep rockin
Glad your doing well and feeling better!
Glad you're recovering ok.. My mom had the same condition since birth.. She was 66 went to Cleveland Clinic for the exact same procedure by Dr. Cosgrove.. She played harp at my brother's wedding only 6 weeks after the operation.. Thank you Rick.. Wishing you all the best ❤️👍😁
Bless you Rick!!!!!
Just hearing about this, Rick! I'm so glad to hear you are doing well...and looking good , too! But, coming from a long line of ZIPPER CLUB members (I'm gonna be due soon), I can only say that if you haven't felt much pain after surgery, then you're not telling us how great your pain meds are... :) I pray you will be around a long long time, Rick!
Sending all good wishes your way. Be well forever!
Great, great, great that everything went perfectly!  You're good as new!  You are a gem!  I don think you should lift any Les Pauls, though!!! 😅
No comments on the content,  I like it all. But, no matter how good you feel, don't skip any rehab.  You may feel great and I'm guessing you are strong, but you had serious surgery.  Take the time to rehab so you will be around for a long time!
I m not surprised that you re up and walking around! I had a one way bypass in 2019 at Cle. Clinic and was up and doing things not too long after, myself!  Glad you re feeling good and ready to Rock, Rick! God Bless!
Take care rick ❤❤❤❤
Glad the surgery went well for you Rick, I hope you heal quickly.
Glad to hear you had a successful surgery and are doing well Rick.
Today's medicine is truly amazing... This sort of thing a couple decades ago would have set you back weeks of recovery... Now it's only days. Good to hear you're doing well.
Glad to hear you’re doing well. I like the new direction of the channel. It’s great to see you intertwine real life stuff in the channel with your own journey and great guests like Tom and Guthrie.
Glad you’re ok Rick!!
Nice to see you are really well.🤎
Thank you so much, Rick. I'm 5 years from a stroke/aphasia etc. So, keep working!
Glad your doing well🎉 What makes this song great is something I miss.I think I’ve watched all of them haha.
Great to see you happy and healthy! :-D I didn't see that post, so thank you for this update video :-)
I'm so glad you're doing well. I thoroughly enjoy all of your interviews. I can't wait to see who will be next.
All the best whishes from Germany. You gonna make it.
Your quick recovery gladdens my heart..LOL. What makes this song great and the interviews are my fav, just don't start interviewing cardiologists LOL. ❤
I'm happy to see how well you are doing.😊
So glad you're doing well. Great channel. Here's to your health
I am happy you have recovered so nicely. Keep on!!!
Hey brother, glad you’re doing good. You have made a difference to thousands of musicians around the world with a treasure of information about music. I really enjoy the song breakdowns and interviews with musicians and producers. Here’s wishing you abundant blessings and an extremely long life. Take care and stay healthy.
Take your time, get fit. Youtube will be here.
Really glad to hear you're on the mend Rick!
What the what?! i just got back home today from robotic mitral valve repair in Kansas City. Some Dr.s had heard murmurs in previous physicals and told me to keep an eye on it. So at my last physical in May, Dr. said it was severe so I got all the tests and booked the procedure so guess that makes us heart brothers, they gave me that same heart pillow LOL! I'm a trumpeter/EVI/bassist/composer and have two sons, aspiring musicians, age 13. I have shown them some of your videos and they love 'em. They are inspiring for sure - you and your son have great ears. Maybe someday we'll meet and have a chat - or better yet - play some music. All the best to you mate and good luck with your recovery. BTW you're looking totally normal!? I've got a huge hole in my neck still from where one of the I.V.s came in!
Welcome to the club, brother! I am so glad the surgery was successful and you are still here with us.  I subscribed becasue of your "Top10" lists. I stayed for that, your song reviews and the interviews. Keep up the mix and I'll be here until I'm called above!
Get well soon!
You are a huge inspiration and a legend. I'm glad that you recovered from the surgery 🙏👍🤩
Great energy!  I wish you all the best with your continuing recovery.
Do whatever makes you happy,  we will enjoy. Get well and strong, take good care and come back when you´re ready. I can wait. :D
Praying for your health Rick!
You know, Rick, you said you can’t lift 10 pounds for the time being but also that you can play guitar… keep in mind some guitars actually weigh more than that!
Rick,  thanks for sharing about your surgery.  Glad all went well.  Looking forward to moving ahead with you.  Peace. Chip
❤🙏🏼
Glad you’re ok! While you’re recovering check out Sleep Token if you haven’t heard about them
Thanks for updating your listeners, Rick.   I may one day be faced with the same procedure, but oddly enough, when I had to see the cardiologist last  summer following a procedure, and again  this spring, the valve regurge wasn't showing up. Anyway, you look great, post op!
I'm glad you are well Rick. 👍
i hope you're ok, rick.,
❤️🙏
First, super glad you're well!! Regarding the channel, I'd love to see (jazz) song analysis focused on simplifying strategies and navigation for soloing. I enjoy your interviews a lot, but I also value the heavy theory stuff.
Hello Rick, Get well soon and best wishes from Germany...
Glad you were tracking it and they did something to fix it....and as you arent obese this will help you last a lot longer!
You are a national treasure. Glad you got fixed up and doing well.
Good to hear you're ok and everything went so well!  I'm going to neet to see a cardiologist soon as well and this gives me some optimism. Thanks Rick!
i had a few concerns and few looksy poo's butt survived general check up and concerns of bleeding or gert.? retired an eat less. but if filled up for sleep can wake up coff hot. last year dr check up think me ok minus dozen come plaints...' glad to see that you made it !'
Glad you're recovering!!!
We're the same age, time brothers I would say (does this even exist?). The great think is you're back and this is awesome. A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with something potentially lethal in my heart, put me at home in absolute rest taking some crazy medicine,  but ten days later another doctor discarded it completely and here I am - kind of a rebirth without having had anything.  I will have many years ahead to watch new Rick Beato's many, many years from now. Take care. Greetings from Brazil.
Glad you’re ok Rick and that you took it on the chin or in your stride or whatever the saying is.
Big love from France Rick. You've created an amazing community here, and you can be proud of that.
glad you're doing well
Wow Rick! I'm so happy you got through this so well!! Hope you don't need much medicine for the rest of yer life. I personally would love a conversation with the awesome Captain Fingers: Lee Ritenour! Probably a LOT of musical adventure stories on guitars! All the very best whishes :-)
Wishing you the best + speedy recovery!  Thanks for all that you do!
Gotta show the scar when it's time.
Glad surgery went well, Rick. Much appreciation for all you do.
Get well soon! We miss you.
❤ you ll be grand.
So relieved for your quick recovery and yes, so grateful for outstanding doctors and medical care.  As for what I'd like to see in the future, I'd express my preferences, but the simple truth is, whatever Rick Beato wants to do, I'm pretty confident it's going to be interesting and informative and thoughtfully put together.   However, I do miss the What Makes This Song Great segments, just saying......
All the best.
Bless you, Rick. Really glad to have you. Take care
Ecstatic for you that the surgery went seamlessly!  Don't rush it, we want you to heal thoroughly so you can start cranking out more interviews and especially more "What makes this song great!" vids. We all love you brother! 💛
Great hear you’re doing well Rick.I’m an avid watcher of your channel in New Zealand and enjoy all your interviews and dissections of Beatles and all the great music of the past.
May I just say, God bless you.  It is scary even being in the hands of a skilled surgeon.  ❤
Love your work. Its a modern miracle, no modern science that's keeping us alive. I've the condition too, diagnosed two years ago. Its not gotten as far to need surgery yet but I have no illusions. Get well, best to your family sir.
Glad you're recovered! May God bless you.
Congrats. I'm curious if there was any bypass done too?  There is quite a gamut of results, with open heart surgery. I'm happy for you, as it seems likely you're in the least discomfort group. Cheers.
That’s amazing Rick. So glad you had a successful surgery and are on a speedy recovery it seems. 🙂 I’m 66 now but at age 64, I had to have a total, left hip replacement and like you, I was amazed at how quickly the recovery went and how normal I feel now…even better. After that I got to thinking…in the old days, a person just couldn’t work anymore or died from a heart attack. We live in truly amazing, medical times…and I’m grateful.  Glad to hear that you’re doing so much better. 🙂 Guitar Player in Helen, Georgia
Rick, like all the others I benefit from what you do. I appreciate who you are and how you communicate. I shared one of your videos with my nephew. (he's on the road with Rick Springfield) He thought your sound man video was amazing. Heal up. And God bless.
All the best to you Mr Beato.God bless.
Wishing you a speedy recovery Rick!
Great to see you back ,go with easy ,maybe you were working to much and your heart didn’t cope with ,be safe
Take care and stay safe, Rick!
Rick you are an inspiration that just keeps getting more inspirational as time goes by.  Thank you for being you.
Glad you’re doing well Rick. I’m a few years older than you and think I possibly may need heart scan it’s been five years since last one. Enough about me.  I prefer song reviews to interviews for what it’s worth.
Lots of Love Rick ❤ Big Hugs 🙏🏻
Glad you're doing well!
We love ya' man 🤘🏽
Wishing you a speedy recovery!
So glad you are okay!  Rock on!
Next time in Cleveland let me know I’ll take you to dinner I worked in the business for over 40 years
Great everything went well. Did you buy the extended warranty? 😂
Good to see you up and around Rick! Stay strong!
Great stuff fella, positivity all the way 👍
My pops had heart surgery and it was a bitch. Feel lucky your up and about a week later. I wish you all the best!
No lifting over 10 pounds? ... I'm sure you can manage for a while without a Les Paul.  Glad you're on the mend, Rick. Take it easy <3
Super glad you are doing so well, Rick.
Glad surgery was such a success! Hoping for a very speedy recovery.
Good to hear you can still play the guitar Rick! Good luck, be well and keep doing what you're doing. As John Lennon said, "Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans..."  ✌
So happy your doing great Rick love from Ireland
Glad you're ok. Thankfully you have the wherewithal to be taken care of toward a positive outcome,pray/endorse for those who fall short of such. RINGO sez-✌️❤
Don't really care what you do, just keep doin' it. Want you around for a long time.
Great news, Rick! You stay strong buddy
Wishing you a great recovery and good health!
Being a Cancer survivor(stage 2 esophagus).. I'm so happy to know that you are ok.  I've learned so much from you...
I glad your heart is keeping perfect rhythm for you! Keep on healing, stay healthy. You are awesome!!
Here's to good health and many more years, Rick!
So glad you are having a successful recovery ❤️‍🩹
Glad everything went well,love your song breakdowns,keep those going❤❤👏👏
Happy to hear you are doing well!
As much as I love the song breakdowns, the interviews are the main attraction.
I'm glad you're recovering well. Perhaps you can make a video about King's X because they're also not getting any younger :)
Good news.
I'm not curious  🙂
Thanks Rick. Best wishes for a full recovery.
Love you duuuuude
Hey Rick! congrats on the successful surgery ... I value your channel as I have incurable Leukemia that keeps me tired and in my recliner most of the time. Keep the great content coming, it really helps me!
So happy to hear you're all good. We need you, man! It's silly but you're like a friend :)
I only discovered your channel a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love your content! I'm glad you're doing well! May you do what you love for as long as you wish
I’m glad you’re doing so well, Rick. Love and appreciate all your interviews and song analysis. Keep rockin’, Bro!
Holy Moses Rick!! Keep it slow and a speedy recovery. And you ARE a national treasure, just as @johndukeoneill said.
Glad you doing so well!
God bless you Rick, and He has. So good to know how you are doing and a great recovery. Make sure you look after your good self and follow the Dr’s orders. From your friend in England
Glad you’re doing ok.
Do what you enjoy!  Sure, we love interviews, but if you are having fun- we will join you.
Love your channel and your courage, i am very happy you recover so quickly, the more because i also, in a year or so, have heart surgery to undergo. you give me courage you are an inspiration and you present great music with love to us. Thank you
Glad you're doing well Rick. We need your insights to continue for a long long time.
Glad you are better, Rick!
Speaking of old age, can we get Mark knopfler on please. He needs to be here.
Great to see you doing so well!  Did your Cardiologist refer you to Cleveland Clinic?
So relieved to see you healthy and making another video already, Rick. You da best!
It's relief to see you are  in good health. I love the interviews with our shared musical heroes. Don't do those. I would love to continue to see more What Makes This Song Great,  especially when you are able to present isolated tracks so we can really hear what's going on. Finally, I love the deep dives into the wonder that is Peter Frampton. If there is any additional subject matter you can cover with him while it's still possible, please do so. Thank you for all that you do, Rick! I love it!!!
Best wishes from Ireland Rick, get well soon brother ❤🎶
Wow! Proof that you have a great Heart!! Take care man.
Glad to see you're doing ok after your "Tune-Up" Rick...We need you in our lives ! And......MORE song breakdowns please....theres SO many good ones from 1955-2024 !
Great news - looking forward to 62 more years from your channel!
Good for you! 👍🤘🙂💯🎉
Thanks for the update Rick. Happy for you and your family that the surgery went so well! You look completely normal 🙂
😀💯you are looking good.... very good..... and we are all happy to see you ......
Now you have a Cleveland Heart. Like Jackson Browne sings about!  Amazing story.  ❤❤❤
Had the same surgery 12 years ago when I was on active duty. Keep walking and using that stupid spirometer and you'll feel better in no time!
I Have a moderate leak, checked every year. All the Best
I think your interviews are the next step for your channel and there are only a few guys out there where it feels natural that this step is the evolution of the channel. But i think for the new followers it would be good to stick to your guns. Still do what you do best. Its in you. You will find the way to reach people. Get well soon rick!
Hi Rick I’m glad you’re doing well! Stay well my friend!! God bless you.
Glad you are doing well Rick. We need you! Loving your interviews so much, so more of them is always great! Peace!
Best wishes for a healthy recovery!!! 🙏🏽
Greetings from Athens Greece speed recovery and take care your self.
I'm so glad you are feeling better. You don't realize the positive impact you have in general. You asked what we would like to see next. Well, you have done several videos on what is wrong with music today. I love to hear your opinion on if you had a magic wand, how would you fix the music industry today? In all aspects business side, recording side, creative process and any other aspects as well. Love your channel. Peace!!!
😇❤‍🩹🙏
Glad you are feeling better Rick.
We love you, Rick!
You're absolutely right. It's freaking amazing that they can do these things.
It's great to know that your surgery went well. I watch your channels regularly and have learned a lot about music in general and guitar specifically. Great news!
We love you Rick! Speedy recovery! 😘
I'm not on any social media or Facebook or anything, Rick, so I didn't see your post brother.  Geeezuz. I had no idea buddy. I didn't know.   You and I are exactly the same age.  So glad you're OK, pal.  Don't go lifting any pianos or groupies. Ha ha ha. 😂 😉  Take care, my friend. 🤗
Glad you’re well! God Bless
It is the vaccine, the rest of the world knows this. Get a clue.
Great to see you doing well after surjery! It would be super cool if by any chance you can interview Andy Wallace and Terry Date. To me, they + Brendan O'Brien are the big three of rock mixing.
❤️✖️
Wishing you a quick recovery !
Hey Rick! So glad to hear your recovery is going well. In terms of content for the channel in the upcoming year. Continue to fill our empty heads with knowledge! Anything you or your interesting guests have to say more than we know.  Saw you at Pat Metheny in Atlanta. The one thing I wondered when you walked out after the beginning of the show was… It’s probably the only way he can go to the bathroom in peace!  keep up the great work.
That’s great to hear Rick!! Keep on rockin’ and get well soon 🤘🏻
Man, please live 50 more years
I bet he got the vaccine. I bet it didnt help the old ticker. Mine went haywire 2 months after the shot
Rick  Beato   welcome   to  Yew Zealand  mate.  You  Have  been  on YouTube for  years,   I   have  always   bypassed   your   channel,   (Rick   Beato   Who,   what the  hell   does    he   do,   doesn't    look  like  a  guitar    player,,,,,,   Nah,   Pass)   But   a   couple  of  years  ago you  were   playing with a  couple  of   guys   who  are  very  good,     And    you   kept  up   with  them<     "Wow"   he  is  not  so  bad   after  all,,   So  From   me,  Nice  one  mate,  keep  up  you   good   work,   we   have    millions of   sheep over  here, nobody  has  open heart   surgery,  we   go   &  sleep   with  the  sheep  until we  get  better   Regards,,,,   Gib
My bro Rick just had a bypass.... he keeps telling me that you like his drumming. Sounds like you had a very successful procedure!
🙏🙏
Happy to see you feeling well.
Glad to hear you made it thru no probs Rick 👍
X❤x
I'm so glad that you are okay.
Much love and respect from Brazil 🇧🇷
Definitely keep up the interviews with people within the producing and recording industry, Each time I see a producer or of the like I am amazed at their range.
Jeez. Just glad you’re ok. My dad had heart surgery (valve replacement), and his recovery was arduous!
Speedy Recovery.  I had the same surgery when I was 48 and am 52 now.  Mitral valve repair and they had to replace my aortic valve.  Glad you are ok.  Love your work
Feel better soon!  Thanks for the cogent history....whew!
So glad for your fast recovery Rick.  You're a beautiful human being.
Rick: Glad you are on the mend & feeling well. Thank you for interview with Kenny Aronoff. It answered so many questions I’ve had on how a drummer learns (or composes) music.
Glad you’re feeling better!
So glad you’re doing well Rick,congratulations!
поскорее поправляйся!)
Great to hear your good news, I’m 72, recovering from surgery last year, and I am now a full time musician. You show has inspired me to write and perform every day. I have so many ideas that I would like send on to you, some good, maybe some not so good, but in any event if we don’t keep hitting the high and low notes, who else is going to. A few of my songs are on Spotify, I just started writing and having a blast, thank you for what you do🎶🎸🤺🎵❤️
Congratulations about your recovery!   I had quadruple bypass surgery 3 years ago so I can relate to your sternum!   I am very grateful to my medical team.  THanks for what you do for us musicians and fans.
You can't stop this man's heart. BEAT is in his m.f.'n name.
My son has bicuspid aortic valve and his diagnosis is similar
I am happy you came through this so well. You act like it is nothing, but it really is. What I like about your channel is I love music, but am not musical. I know what I like and what I don't, but you really help me understand why I like a song with your breakdowns. You are not making me more musically inclined, but my understanding of music has improved. I also like your Top Ten or more lists. We don't always agree, but that is the point. Music is personal.  So I would like to see your channel continue in that way and maybe add lists based on decades as music has changed decade after decade until it reached this musical void of modern computer created noise.
Hey Rick  Happy to see you on YT. Did you see Joe B n Train do 38 Special ? Think that guitar work is deserving of a Beato ? Aloha Friend and Peace be with You !
Keep up the great work, Rick 🤘
God Bless you Rick !!  -So great to hear everything just did well !!!!! - lets go further...as life.....keep on our patch....
We need you to stick around for a bit longer, buddy. No one else can tell us with such authority why we like the music we like. You have opened my eyes to music. I can't thank you enough.
Really happy to hear everything went well and that you're feeling great. Cheers from Scandinavia!
good glad your ok
Wow Rick! One week into recovery and you look and sound great, best wishes for your continued recovery!
Happy you are still with us 🙏 A major surgery can certainly change your perspective.
Routine procedures are a b man. Rock on Ricky
Used to love watching the "What Makes This Song Great" series but now hooked crazy to the interviews you've been doing, the good 1 or 2 hour long ones and can't seem to get enough of them. So many discoveries from Steely Dan to other great artists thanks to your channel. They're not just interviews about music the artists have created but you get to see a human side of those artists and connect with their personalities on a deeper level. It's been amazing!
let me conclude finally that you are an INTERGALACTIC treasure. i would have no conception of having so many people caring about my well-being but you're proof that it happens.
Glad you're well!  Love your input on our favorite music.  Prayers to your family and your health!!!  Rock on and on and on and on...
Welcome back Rick. ❤❤
Te deseo todo lo mejor desde España.
Me too and I feel so much better!
Hey Rick!  What did you think of Cleveland while you were in town?  Which museums did you go to?  Catch any of our local music scene? Glad you doing better.
Love you, Rick! Keep getting well.
So glad you are doing well, Rick.  Your hospital visit was a bit of a shock.  I'm 64, and have had my heart stopped during surgery once.  I'm glad you made it through so well.
Glad to hear you're good - Don't pick up any Les Pauls for the next few weeks 🙂
So glad your healing up.
You're amazing.  Full stop.  I'm an avid consumer of your vids and courses.  SO glad you're well again!
The only comment is: take care of yourself Rick. Bless you.
My aunt lived with THE PIGGY VALVE til age 95!!!!
You are not going into several weeks of rehab clinic?
🌞Best Wishes Always
I would love to see more 'what makes this song great'!
Welcome back to the office Rick, we need you here.
Great to see you here Rick. You're looking awesome!
You bring joy into our lives. Glad you came out of it well. Thank you for all that you do for making our lives more beautiful every day!
All the best for you Rick. The master!
Look like you've lost a lot of weight. Hope you get back to 100% very soon. God bless. P.S. Was it an expensive procedure? Did your insurance cover it?
Hey, do what you'd like with the channel. You've contributed to so many for so long, you deserve it, and we'll all watch anyway for your huge knowledge base and personable presentations. Glad you feel good and like everyone I wish you a long and enjoyable life. I'll never forget you screaming at the clouds, always makes me smile. Take care, good sir.
So you can't lift a Les Paul for a while?
"What makes this song great for recovery and renewal"?  I suggest Hello Hooray, Alice Cooper.  But that's just the first one that came to mind.  Glad to hear your surgery went well!
Speedy recovery, Rick‼️👍
The Bionic Beato!  Happy for a successful procedure.
Live long and prosper, Rick!
I’m glad you’re doing so well.
Good to hear. Prayers for a speedy recovery.  Your voice has a slight raspiness, probably due to the intubation.
I'm glad you're feeling better, Rick. Keep informing us and interviewing the gods of guitar!
One week post open heart surgery and you sitting there producing new content as nothing had happened🫣. To do so, you must be, apart from the heart condition, a healthy music producer! 😉 As an intensive care professional I would like you to give a little advice for the problem of coughing after thoracotomy: Take a pillow in front of your sternum and squeeze it tightly with both arms when you feel you're about to cough. It takes away a little of the pain and helps to protect the cerclage that is joining the sternum. A Posthorax® sternum support vest (or a similar medical product) might be helpful as well.
Wishing you a speedy recovery.
Take care Rick ✌️ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 ❤
I’m just glad you’re OK Rick🙏❤️
Rick, I've been a fan of yours for years, and thoroughly enjoy your videos/interviews.  I've had 4 open heart surgeries from 2 days old up until the age of 19.  My family moved up to the Cleveland area in fall of 2001 after my father accepted work for Progressive Insurance in Mayfield Village OH. All this change of scenery for our family (TX)  would actually become a blessing in disguise for our family in more ways than one.    Being born with 3 holes in my heart (Aorta, Right Ventricle, Right Atrium). Congenital Heart Disease demands  personal upkeep and followage by skilled medical professionals. The amazingly skilled Cardiac Surgeons of Cleveland Clinic would be instrumental in my survival, far more than I'd ever know.       I had my last and most recent open heart surgery at Cleveland Clinic, in 2004. Dr. Roger Mee, renowned Pediatric Cardiac surgeon, from Cleveland Clinic was second to none! My Aorta at birth didn't form correctly, which is called an Interrupted Aortic Arch (IAA) in the Heart biz. The ideal surgical solution to this anomaly was to have an Anastomosis (direct connection) to my Aorta, without the use of an artificial graft. Aortic grafts are popular but like anything man made, need replacement after some years.I'd already had 2 previous Gore Tex grafts that I'd outgrown over the years.       Open heart operations weren't foreign to me by any means, but it's still a daunting task to undergo whenever you hear from a Dr that "you need open heart surgery. I'm forever grateful to the doctors of Cleveland Clinic for saving my life, and allowing me to live on today.   I wish you the absolute best, and God Bless you and your doctors!
The best wishes about your health.
Hi! I'm so glad you're doing well, and hope you continue to heal! I would love more song breakdown videos!! Love your channel!! Sending lots of love and positive healing vibes!! 💕
Glad you're okay!
Rick , you're in luck... if you can't lift anything over 10 pounds, your just squeek in... A Les Paul weighs between 9 and 11 lbs.
Let's make sure we keep Rick Beat-o, because I don't want Rick No-Beato!   I wish you a speedy recovery!  :)
Thank you for keeping us updated! Looking good, Rick!
I would love to see a songwriting session with a world class Nashville songwriter. How it all work. You play the artist and walk through all the steps from talking for the first time to tracking a demo.
Glad to hear you're doing well after the surgery, Rick!  As for the future, we need a What Makes This Song Great on a Stevie Ray Vaughan song!
Could you do a breakdown of “that voice again” by Peter Gabriel?? ❤glad you’re doing okay
All the best Rick. Hope you keep feeling well. So much loss & illness, especially among classic rock musicians lately.
Looks like you recovered well and fast! Happy to have you back, Rick!
Glad you're on the mend. All my best to you for a speedy recovery!
Glad you're doing better Rick!
god speed my friend
Glad you’re well Rick, blessings from the UK 🇬🇧 😊
In the words of Neil Young, Long May You Run.
Looking good Rick!! I wish you a further speedy recovery, sound's like they fixed up your heart pretty good. 🤗
Have a healthy and happy recovery Rick, all the best and keep on rockin'!!!!
Blessings always, Rick. Glad you’re back and doing well.
Thank God you are feeling good. Christ is King.
Glad to see you’ve still got the beat, Rick. Party hearty. 🎉
Really hope you're well and wish you a full recovery. Sorry I didn't bump into you when you visited my hometown (Liverpool, UK).
oh man you ok
Direction of the channel? Do whatever you're most passionate about at the time you're making the video..
Thanks for the update!  Keep mending, cheers! 🙏
You're a globally treasure, Rick. Take care and blessings 🙌
Glad you're doing well Rick. Hope you feel better and better.
Great you're doing OK, best wishes.
Congrats Rick! It will be great news interviews (in person) to Scott Henderson and Kurt Rosenwinkel. Greetings from Argentina!
Prend soin de toi Rick
I'm just happy you're well
Long live Rick Beato!!! You look a bit skinny after surgery...
God Bless you Rick!
Wishing you a full recovery and look forward to all the vids!! x
Glad your surgery went well and your issue was addressed on time. My son has Down Syndrome, and was born with "AV Canal," which is basically a big hole between all 4 chambers of the heart. Surgeons were able to do a complete repair, and 18 years later a mild mitral valve regurgitation is the only lingering issue. So far it has held totally steady, but may need further repair in the future. Great to see you were able to recover so quickly!
Rick, it's not just your videos we love,it's you. Your personality, demeanor, just an absolute professional on all levels. Thank you so much for all you do. 🙏🏻
Glad you're good to go, Rick. I'm a stroke, heart attack survivor. No surgeries of any kind. I was extremely lucky. Been 5.5 years since that awful day, but I live a normal, stress-free, quiet life. I just turned 61 in May, so lot's of retro inventory and letting go. Good to have you back!
Glad your ok Rick ok  Adrean Bealew. When😊😊😊
Get well soon!
Glad your feeling better..
Thank you for sharing this Rick, you are an inspiration.
Thanks for the update and for the interesting, informative and entertaining videos! I’m so happy your recovery is going so well and I look forward to more great content in the future. I enjoy the interviews but your song breakdowns are some of my favorites. I’ve learned so much about songs I love, thanks to you!
Well done Rick… big love from the UK
God bless you Rick 🙏
Great news!
GODSPEED MR. BEATO!!! ❤
I hate when my sternum clicks.  Get well soon.  DON'T SNEEZE!!!!
what makes the song great suggestion...dead kennedys - holiday in cambodia...you could prolly contact east bay ray to talk about this song...hes a down to earth guy and not snooty
I wish you'll recover fully, Rick !!
He's better than he was before! Better....stronger....faster.... so glad you're doing well, Rick! Enjoy the new lease on life! Mahalo for all you do... we enjoy it!
You are an amazing man Rick and your channel has been such a help for me over the years. I'll keep you in my prayers for your continued recovery!!
Glad to hear everything went well!  I enjoy everything you do!   I do like the What makes this song great episodes
I really have appreciated your channel over the years and have loved the long form interviews.  More of that please.  Have you ever considered starting your own label and trying to groom young bands in the "New Music Industry"?  This would be a great service to society and the art/music community. Who better equipped to do this?  How else is the Top 10 of "the charts" going to someday actually have good music again?
Glad you're well sir.
Glad to hear you are doing well.
I've never had surgery, but I do have five stents. First three at 56, two more at 62. I'm now 73 and fine. As long as you don't do anything to excess, you'll be good for many many years to come. And we all want that.
How appropriate that you had the surgery in Cleveland ❤️
Thank you for sharing this Rick. I have pretty much the same thing, but I'm still in the "we'll keep an eye on it" mode. Good to know that it was so successful and that the recovery is so quick. You look great. Take care and don't rush back too quick, take it easy at least a little bit :) Thanks for all that you do.
Glad to hear you're feeling well.  Wishing you all the best.
Hello Rick! I'm sending you all the congratulations on your open heart surgery you just had most successfully from me here in Los Angeles that I can possibly send!!! I have been watching and enjoying your videos and interviews for a number of years now and yours are for sure some of the very best. Not too long ago you interviewed a friend of mine, the legendary bassist Leland Sklar.  Last year I set up a book signing event for him at Norm's Rare Guitars in Tarzana,  CA. You may have seen the video and interview that Norm did on his YouTube channel.  Your interview with Lee was really well done!!! He's now out on the Summer tour with Lyle Lovett and his Large Band along with fellow drummer Russ Kunkel of the Immediate Family. Anyway Rick I was sure surprised to see you in the hospital and very glad that you're doing great. I'm a subscriber and I look forward to all of your upcoming videos. My best wishes to you for your continued excellent recovery and return to your wonderful YouTube posts!!! Bob Love,  Los Angeles,  CA age 77!!
Wishing you a full and speedy recovery Rick !!🙏❤️
Jesus H Christ don't do this I need your channel.
Fantastic News!   So glad you are on the mend.  ❤
What a champ!  Sounds like you had a stellar team work on you.  Glad you are all fixed.
Glad things went well Rick! Best of health to you sir!
keep rockin'! never give up! I have the same long wound (but on the belly) due to 4 surgeries during the last 30 years (Crohn's Desease). Music is (one of) the therapy! 🤎❤♥🤎❤
Nice to see you're good to go and healthy .  love ya Rick!
Rick, you look good, healthy! I'm so glad it was a success, love you❤
Very happy to see you are doing good Rick!
Great that you’re OK Rick….keep on truckin’   👍🇬🇧👍
Congratulations on the successful operation and welcome back to 110%!
Glad to see you’re doing well! Here’s to long life!
Incredible isn't it? So lucky to have these levels of surgical ability today. Onward and upward!
All the best!!!
Hey, welcome back. Here's to your next sixty-two years.
Hey it’s so good to see you back and doing so well =) modern medicine is amazing!!!
One of your most endearing and certainly important videos. With all the affection we have for our instruments what’s most important is the life that breathes life into them. Thank you for all you do and stay well.  EVERYONE.
Welcome back
Glad you're healing well Rick. You're an awesome human being! Thank you for sharing your knowledge!
Glad you are ok. Rock on, Rick!
Prayers abound Rick & Family.
Really really really really dig the interviews
Get well Rick.
Glad all went well for you Rick....Im 62 with heart issues as well....keep on keeping on brother. 😁
So happy you're doing well, Rick!
Good news ✌🏻
Great to hear you’re doing so well!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻
You're amazing, Professor!  Being profoundly tone deaf, I can't play any instruments, but I really enjoy your analyses of songs from all genres.  Keep doing all that you do.
You actually look better too, you were getting kinda pasty looking and I was wondering (former paramedic here).  Your color is back and. you look much better.
Try to get healthy, but because a lot of people love your channel they like what you do come across as a good guy and that’s rare on the Internet
Brings tears to my eyes, Rick...really. God bless.
Good news. Stay healthy Rick
My thoughts on the direction of the channel: keep on keepin on. Oh yes, and more What Makes This Song Great.
Dear Rick. I wish you all the best. Get well soon and please take care of yourself. Warmest regards.
I'm glad you are well, sir. ❤
Good for you!
Glad you are okay. It sure helps when you have the best of the best care.
Awesome result! Good news is a great thing these days. Thanks for sharing. (I’m from Cleveland and 74 so been through that as well check out Full Sail. You might like it 🎶🙂)
National Treasure indeed....we love and support you RB.
Great to hear you are doing well. We all had a moment of !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!!. For the future, follow your instincts. They have served you and your audience well.  Godspeed
Glad everything went well for you Rick get better quickly my friend . Just keep doing what you’re doing 👍🎶
all the best for you, Rick!
Glad you are doing well.  I'm 58 and know what's it like to go through some craziness.  Love your channel.  Get even better!
So glad you are better Rick. I wish you many more years of good health.  Eric
Bless you Rick, one of life's gentleman...Wishing you all the very best
Phew!
Great to hear you're in good health. Your channel is awesome. Keep doing whatever you think is right.
I live 30 minutes south of cleveland, you were in good hands, cleveland clinic is best in the country. Im a subscriber of your channel, and im so glad your doing good Rick, i love your interviews and content, keep it going, much respect.
Praying for complete recovery and healing for you. 🙏
Glad you are doing well Rick!
I'm glad you're in good health Rick. Thank you for your honesty and for all the content! I look forward to more
NICE TO SEE YOU DOING WELL MY FRIEND
Congratulations on the successful repair! I'm so glad you had this done. Cleveland Clinic is an excellent choice. Take your time getting back into this particular saddle, and please be well. You mean so much to so many of us.
Get well Rick! Love your channel!
Glad that you are doing well, wishing you a speedy recovery!!  I love the what makes this song great and the new music reviews.
Great news, love that the surgery was successful and you're better than ever!
Congrats on your successful operation Rick! Take all the time you need to recover (you had open heart surgery after all lol). We will still be here when  your next video drops so don't worry too much about getting out to us as quickly as you can.
Rick, I'm so glad that you surgery went well and your recover is good 👍👍
The interviews are great. I also like the song and album breakdowns. Not so much the stuff about the current SHIT they pass off as music. Best wishes!
I suggest this channel should become entirely dedicated dto pro paintballing
Hello, Rick! I’m so glad to hear that you’re feeling better! Go slow, don’t do any top-10 analysis video  so you don’t get too mad (just kidding 😄). Wishing you all the best, a big fan from Portugal ❤️
unless they’re a popular musician, i really don’t know most people you interview. i enjoy the song lists. but as a fellow atlantan, take care Rick!
imagine thumbing this video done, sad! Good to hear you are ok!
praying for the best recovery possible Mr. Beato...  May God bless you and thank you for being such an amazing inspiration!!
I love your music breakdowns Rick and I'm soooooo happy for you (and for us too!) that you're back and healthy and looking great (I'm 61 btw).  If you haven't done any Pink Floyd music breakdowns could you do some of theirs please? :)
Take goid care Rick. We all love music but at the end of the day lifeis so much mote than our stufg
congrats on a successful procedure and new outlook on life - no heavy LP's for you LOL !!!
I’m so happy that you’re doing great young man (I’m 63) when I was in jr high my friend Brian had open heart surgery around 1975 and he’s still going strong, look him up Brian Slagel owner / founder of Metal Blade records.
Rick, I went through the same surgery 10 years ago when I was your age youngster (now I'm 72). I didn't recover as fast as you have here - I was in the hospital for a week likely due to other medical conditions I have that required monitoring, but it was much smoother process overall than I expected. They've got this wired - according to my cardiologist, it's the most commonly performed surgical procedure on people over 60. The most difficult aspect was that I had to take a blood thinner for at least a month or 6 weeks if not longer, and during that time they have nurses constantly draw my blood both at their clinic and in my residence. They need to adjust your diet while you're taking blood thinner   Worst of all, you can't use Viagra until they discontinue the blood thinner.  Glad you're good and welcome to the Cardiac Club (possibly a decent name for a band).
You were in great hands, my friend.  My wife had the exact same surgery with the exact same surgeon almost exactly one year ago.  Dr. Gillinov and the Cleveland Clinic are fantastic!  Best wishes for a full recovery with no surprises!  Now go crush that cardiac rehab.
So glad you got this taken care of. Here's to many, many more years.
Godspeed Rick, 4 months ago my heart stopped and to wake up in an hospital with no recollection of nothing made me see the 2nd chance in living!!!
I'm so glad things went well and you're feeling well.  No Les Pauls until cleared by your doctor! 😊
Glad the surgery went well and you are on the mend!
I don't know who you are but good job man
You’re our guy!!! So much love for ya brotha!!
Keep well be well Rick and you'll be yourself again. Glad the surgery was successful. Had my mitral valve repaired at Sunnybrook, Toronto., 7 yrs ago at 62, 2.5 yrs after detection.
Long healthy life Rick!!
Glad you're feeling better and surgery went well, Rick. Keep rockin Brother!
Glad you're ok, Rick.:)
Rick I love watching your videos and interviews.  I’m a 75 year old Hawaiian blessed to still be alive after my tour in Vietnam and 28 years of law enforcement.  Music has kept me going for all these years.  God Bless brother🙏🏽
Glad everything went well, Rick.  My grandfather had open-heart at the Clinic nearly 50 years ago, but the surgeries back then were very different, even though his was also for a valve replacement.  As I recall, he was in the hospital for at least a week.  I also used to work at another hospital in that area, one that is no longer there.  The University Circle area where the Clinic and University Hospital are located is absolutely beautiful, especially in the spring when the flowers and trees are in bloom.
High five on the interviews. Keep em coming. Yours are some of the best musician interviews ever.
We love you Rick. Yours is a beautiful positive voice in an often negative world and as far as I am concerned you are your channel's North Star, so simply, all you need do is speak, guide or comment as is your want and its direction will be just perfect. Thanks for everything.
I had a quadruple bypass at the Cleveland Clinic last year. They did a wonderful job, you chose the right place to go to. Glad you're doing better, love your channel!
Long life and good health, Rick.
Take care of yourself Rick!!! All good thoughts!!!!
I'm sixty-one … I know I have a heart problem. Perhaps it is time to have a doctor look at it. This video hits home.  Thanks Rick!
Best wishes Rick!
hang in there, Rick!
15 years ago I had open heart surgery.  Praise be to the fact science is able to provide us this therapy.  Best wishes for a full recovery.
glad you're okay!
Hi Rick Great to hear your surgery and recovery has gone well Your a unique and pioneering guy Take it easy in the future,anything you decide to do with the future format will always be appreciated by everyone Good luck and kindest regards Les Evans Southend GB
Thank God your ok Rick as a fellow guy from Newnan,Georgia Alan Jackson once wrote in a song called Prop Me By The Jukebox " I wanna go to Heaven just dont wanna go tonight"  thats how i felt when i sur4vived a heart attack a few years ago ! I wish you would do more late 80s & early 90s Country !
Happy to hear this news Rick. Now rub some dirt on it and get back in the game! You're a tough old ba....love you Man.
A few yrs ago, the arthritis in my left hip got to where I could barely walk to the end of my driveway & back for the pain. I had it replaced at the end of '21, and did the right one a year later. What a difference! I was on the table for less than an hour each time, and they had me on my feet the day after. I used a walker for the 1st few days - maybe a week - then to a cane - then to freestyle. Within a month I was walking 3-5 miles at a pop (groomed trails only - no bushwhacking). I'm 75 now, and still get a little emotional about being able to access some of my favorite hiking spots again. Rock on, man. Do your PT, respect your age, and enjoy each and every sunrise.
Prayers for a speedy recovery,  Rick!
Strong recovery Rick!!
Glad you made it well.
Yea I’ll be having a septal myectomy at the Cleveland clinic in a few months for cardiomyopathy. Not looking forward to it but it has to be done. Glad you’re doing better Rick.
Great to see you’re recovering well Rick
That’s great news, Rick. Glad everything went so well and smoothly. It’s amazing that you’re up and running so fast already after such an intense procedure. I wish you a speedy recovery.
Glad to hear you're well and on the mend Rick!
Have a speedy recovery Rick, keep giving us your best as usual
Glad your operation was a success.  I am now 7 years since surviving a widow maker heart attack. Thanking the Lord, as every new day is a gift.  As long as we are on the topic, this is a reminder to everyone to get a stress test. Be proactive and avoid a surprise that could end your life. Any odd sensation around your heart, get it checked out, even if it seems like nothing. Enjoying your videos; keep up the great work.
Glad you're doing well!
Glad you are back on deck, safe and well.
Great to hear the surgery was a success and that you are feeling well Rick!  Cleveland Clinic saved my life and is one of the best.  Take it slow, we'll all still be here when you're back at100%.
Great to see you with full energy, and yeah, you're right you look like you went to the dentist...!!  Hard to tell you had heart surgery.  Hope this was just a bump in your everyday life, now you're fixed and ready to have those great videos. God bless and wish you the best...!!
Glad to see you're doing fine! Cheers from France 🙂
So glad to hear that you are ok!
Your Story about your heart issue is encouraging especially for those who are facing the same.
Glad you're doing well, brother. Rest up.
Thankful that you came through this successfully.
Glad you're doing well, Rick.
Good to hear from you and see you active again, Rick!!! Take good care of yourself, recover fully (never mind "quickly") and we're here when you're ready 🙏😎👍
Salud! ❤
Wish you good health for any kind of future projects, love to see whatever it is. I  like your interviews, but I loved your "What makes this song great" stuff, doesn't have to be super regular, but the format was very cool and interesting, song choices great, also love your collaborations with other YouTuber and musicians, just glad everything went fine and I get to see some more RB content 😀
Good to see that you are recovering quickly. Best wishes.
Love ur channel Rick. ☝️😩 I for one, would love to c u do an open mic night. 👌 U alone or with a buddy on guitar, bass or maby piano? Who wouldn't  wana c that? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Speedy recovery Sir!
Show us your cool scar Rick! Hope you are feeling well mate
Glad you're doing well Rick! Keep it up!
Wishing you a speedy recovery!
Good to hear you're feeling so well so quickly. Take care of yourself,  best wishes from one old bloke to another 😄
Wishing you long life and great health Rick!
Happy to hear that you are recovering so well <3!
So glad you're doing well!
So happy for you and thank you for all you do
Glad to hear your better Rick
Thank God. ❤
👍👍👍👍👍
Wishing you a speedy recovery.
I believe Rick has a good heart
Glad to hear these good news Rick!
That's great! Amazing what doctors can do. Sad thing is I knew 5 people died here in Alabama during COVID, they got their medical advice from Tucker Carlson and Fox News rather than the doctors that have spent years learning these things. That's why we pay them and that's why God them to us.
Grab a container of Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen and put a scoop in your protein drink in the a.m. every morning from here on out. No joke,this stuff rolls back the years for us men of a certain age.😊
Greetings from London! Get well soon, my friend, and may the man of Leipzig bring healing and renewed health.
I say it again: stop the heroin. Its no good for you.
Rick. Great news! You’re not going anywhere anytime soon sir!!! 😊
Good  to see you. Thank you for sharing the story. Welcome back!
Glad to hear your doing great.   (My wife is (was) a Cardiology Nurse Practitioner so I understood all you described.) Awesome.
Good to see you on the mend Rick, take it as easy as you need, we'll be here when you get back!
Rick , glad you are doing well … love your video’s .. keep getting better ❤️‍🩹 😊🎸🎸
So glad your doing good! Keep it up! ❤
God bless you!  😊
Glad you are feeling better, take care of yourself bubba! Love your channel's and content looking forward to many more.
Cheers from the southernmost part of Brazil, Rick. You got plenty of fans down here as well! ❤
Rick, I've always considered you my Best music teacher, I'm happy to see you're getting better. I'm looking forward to more videos!
Glad to hear it was a success. We need more ppl like you on this side of the turf. Kudos!
we are glad you are doin better!!
Good to have you back, Sir!
Glad to see & hear that you are well. Whatever you want to do with the channels, I'm in!! Thank you so much!
Wishing you good health and speedy recovery!
Glad everything went smoothly! I love the interviews, BTW, esp Michael McDonald
Hi Rick. I'm glad to know you are doing well. Take care.
"I went to some museums ..." hopefully included that one just to the west of Burke Lakefront Airport!! I also have a leaky mitral valve; mine is still working OK, happily. My prostate, not so much.
Glad you're okay, Rick!
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK RICK ....TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF !! WE NEED YOU ! THANX FOR THE INFO....I LIKE EVERYTHING YOU DO !!....GET JIMMY PAIGE!!
God bless you man! Glad to see you back and strong again!
Glad you're doing okay Rick, and you're looking good! :) BTW, I had bypass surgery a couple of years ago which was hell recovering! I'm okay now, however...
Really happy you're doing so well Rick
Great to hear you're doing better.
Thanks for the update Rick - glad you're doing well.  As for the channel, I would personally love to see an interview or collaboration with Elizabeth from The Charismatic Voice.
Contemporary music sucks, but you shine.
Wishing you a speedy full recovery Rick.♥🫀
I'm glad you're doing OK
Hi Rick, has anyone ever told you, you look just like Michael Imperioli (Chris from The Sopranos)?
Rick: Didn't know about your situation. Glad to see you are doing great.
Wishing you a speedy recovery and good health for the future!
Praying for you.
Glad you're doing well!
Glad you're OK
So, this is basically an ad for that specific surgeon. Duh!
Change your strings 🎸 fix your heart 🫀 musician's life 🎶   Keep rockin'.  😎✌️
Direction of the channel.  It would be nice to know about groups you are interested in seeing live then maybe I would follow them and see if they play near me locally.  I’m older than you and like pretty much what you like so a mention on one or two each video would be nice than I’ll keep an eye out if they tour.  Not crazy big bands just those quiet great ones.  My brother-in-law had the same operation.  Sit in the back seat of the car until you fully heal.  :-)).
🙏🙏🙏
We send you our strength from France. Keep rocking, Rick!
Glad you're doing well. Love your videos, even though, when you get into the weeds, I don't understand what the fuck your talking about.
Get well fast, God speed. We love you, Rick!
Glad you're ok Rick! Thanks for everything!
Great to hear...heal up and be well! ❤❤‍🩹
Get well!!
Glad you're doing well ❤🙏💪
👏👏👏
I'm glad you sailed through it Rick - welcome back!
We love ya', man! Your passion is infectious, for sure!!!
Good to see you are doing well. Take care
We love you Rick, we are all so thankful you are still here with us.   You are an amazing teacher and mentor.   May God continue to bless you.
I'm glad that your surgery went great and you're back as if nothing happened. Wish you a fast total recovery. 👌🤗
Great news!  Wishing the best recovery and look forward to more of this channel! 💪
I had the same condition and had surgery in 2018.
Had 3 active stents implanted after my heart attack 10 years ago at 41; best advices I can give you is to stay active, do what you love and enjoy the company of your loved ones. Hope to continue to see some of the best music related content on YouTube dear Rick, you rock! A fan from France 🇫🇷
I was so hoping the Doctors did an acapella "Unchain My Heart" before they put you under......glad they fixed your Metronome.
Get well, Rick! We all gonna be here when you come back
Incredible ... you look great, man! Glad you're feeling good, and that everything went well!  Best wishes for your continued recovery!! 🎉🎉
Glad to learn you‘re doing good. Wish you a good recovery, all the best! Greetings from Germany
I glad That u make it well🙏🙏🙏
Hey Rick!   In 2013, I too had a full median sternotomy for mitral valve regurgitation repair. Made a very quick recovery and was out of the hospital in 4-5 days, then back at work after 4 weeks. My surgeon was Dr. Scott Merrick, head of cardiothoracic (sp?) Surgery at UCSF Parnassus (SF, CA).  Those staples and sutures in your chest are going to take some time to heal but you appear to be on the road to healing.  Best wishes for a great recovery, love your channel ;)  Jay
Hi Rick, So glad that you're doing better. Sorry you had to go through that. I enjoy your show so much and appreciate you. All the best.
Happy you're well.
Mostly, I am just gratified to hear your surgery went well and you’re feeling good. God bless you and your family.   Since you asked us, the “what makes this song great” videos were what got me hooked so as long as you enjoy making them, I’ll enjoy watching them. But I’ve enjoyed the interviews too— Rob DeLeo and Bud O’Brien to name two. It’s win win. Take care
Glad the procedure went so well. 👍
Lots of love from Germany! Glad to hear you’re well! Very much looking forward to new videos, especially WMTSG! ❤🙏🎶🎸
Glad you're okay!  My favorite videos are definitely the "What Makes This Song Great" videos.
Rick, just a comment to encourage you to read through All of these comments lol. But seriously, you need to hear and see not only the support, but the gratitude of so many people for the difference you have made in our lives. So much inspiration and encouragement to engage or re-engage with music on so many levels. So much we have learned. Keep keeping on! And hopefully we will see a Paul McCartney interview sometime soon. Letter/email campaign?
God Bless You, Rick!!! Glad it all went well! I have the same issue (at 66). Everything is good so far, but you reporting this is making me think I should discuss it with my cardiologist. Thanks for sharing the information. And the channel? Any time you break down a song is a great day.
My mother had the same surgery.   Changed her life completely.   Just be careful with getting your checkups.   Those blood thinners can be a  little tricky.
Rick, you went to the right place!  Cleveland Clinic is the gold standard for cardiac surgery.  I have worked with many of the surgeons (including the former CEO, Dr. Toby Cosgrove) and many of the cardiothoracic anesthesiologists.  The fact that you're up, back home, and pain free is a tribute to not only the care you received but the overall state of your health.  I'm so pleased you had a great experience here in Cleveland (did you get to the R&R HOF????) and keep up your amazing music theory / analysis channel.  Jeff Wahl (patient safety / risk management attorney,  Beachwood Ohio)
Good on you. That's not an easy surgery. You are looking great for 1 week!
Take care Rick !
I'm glad you're doing well.
I had a heart attack a couple years ago, and I moved to Ohio, where I also see a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Their level of care is beyond everyone else. Glad you're doing well!
Keep rockin' Rick!
May my Ancient Nordic Gods protect you on Your Journey Rick! You're a gem 🙏🏻
Glad this is behind you, Rick.   Speedy recovery, I am sure you will do well.
Thank you for touching our lives Rick. You are a treasure. Keep well and strong!
Glad to hear that you are recovering well and without pain or other side effect. Stay healthy!
I'm a cardiac sonographer. I'm sure you've had your share of echocardiograms. Let me just say that I'm impressed that you're home and feeling so well this soon following open-heart surgery. You look lean and healthy. I'm happy that your pain is manageable. I know cardiac patients dread a cough and especially a sneeze. I'm a subscriber to your channel, and I follow you regularly. I'm selfishly happy that you'll be continuing to share your vast knowledge of music with the rest of us. Well done!
Love your Channel Rick. Be careful with that Sternotomy. Listen to the Dr. and don't lift, stretch, or strain for 2-3 months. Better safe than sorry. I had Double Bypass in 2022. About a year later, I had the wires removed from the Sternotomy and felt better after that. I recommend wire removal  next summer.
Glad to hear you are doing ok Rick.
Still looking for a Mike Keneally show now that you've talked to everyone he's worked for--Vai, Satch, among others.  WMTSG is always welcome, but maybe move past the Grunge stuff?
Great that you're doing well Rick, keep on truckin' brother.
🙏 Wish you a fast recover.
So glad you’re back and in good health. The music world can’t afford to lose you, Rick. You’re such an important voice in the community. Love and greetings from Copenhagen, Denmark❤
Wishing you a speedy recovery!
I'm glad that you recovered so quickly!
I'm very happy that you had overcome that situation, a lot of appreciation 🤍 , stay well 💐💐
You are greatly needed and loved Rick! I can no longer imagine life without your channel. It has been such an amazing journey!
Glad you're doing better.  I had no idea any of this was going on.  Whew!
Mr. Beato, I wish you the best of health in each of your days to come, a hug from Mexico.
All the BEST, Rick.
Glad your ok god and I have your back blessings upon you
Very best wishes to you, Rick. Is the Cleveland Clinic where Dr Mark Hyman works? He's amazing!
Rick, so glad that all went well with your surgery. I hope you recover fully and quickly. Regarding your channel, your what makes this song great, with analysis of stems in particular is unique on YT. Would love to see more of that. Your recreations are also something I look forward to. Your channel is premier in the YT music space, keep it coming!
Glad my home town and the world renowned Clinic treated you right.  Hope you saw the art museum amongst others. As for channel... mix it up! By that I mean I enjoy song breakdowns, best whatever lists, interviews, what makes song great, theory, Spotify top 10, etc.  Easy to get in rhythm and therefore a rut, but I enjoy a constant mix to keep it fresh.  Glad you are doing well sir & look forward to your new work.  BTW... Technically speaking, does your time addressing your heart mean exclusive Tik Tok work now?
Glad you are ok, Rick.  I really like the way you interview the musicians.  You know how to play the music and you aren't superficial with your questions.  More interviews!
Glad you’re well !! 62 is the new 52.
🎉🎉🎉man you make sound like a simple thing...CHEERS you look great stay healthy and happy 🎉🎉
Fan submitted song breakdowns would be a neat addition to the channel. I would love to get feedback on my own work, considering I write, but do not read.
Thanks for the update Rick and so glad to hear you are up and about. It is amazing what they can do now. Can't believe you were alowed to go sight seeing straight after the opp.
Rick please slow down, take some time to spend with your family. Just focus on the interviews: less is more! Take care.
You will feel years younger and more energetic from now on! Best wishes.
So glad you are recovering so well Rick.  Best wishes for continues healing.  But nothing over 10lbs?  I guess that eliminates the Norlin Era Les Pauls...
Praise God!!  Glad you had a successful surgery, Rick!  👏👏
All the best to you Rick always 👍
Miraculous. Every surgery that I've ever had (3 or 4) has gone badly. Even ended my music career. Glad you've got lucky!
Can I play the guitar? Doctor, "Yes." Can I play my 1980 Gibson Les Paul Custom? Doctor Feel Good, "I SAID NOTHING OVER TEN POUNDS!"
YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL RICK, never stop what you're doing, genuine real authentic music is what most of us are here to learn about, and your way of comunicating your knowledge for us to learn from is second to none!  62yrs young? is that all? you got a whole lot more to talk about yet bro!!! ALL THE BEST TAKE CARE STAY WELL!!!   😉 keep on rockin' in a free world.
keep getting well brother!!
🍀🍀🍀🍀.
Glad all is going well. My mom had open heart surgery in the 80's and was down for 6 weeks. 20 years later I had an uncle who had one and like you was doing things a week later! Glad your better, baby steps to get where you want to be
Your unique take on analyzing music has been an educational treasure.  I'm happy to hear that  your procedure went well, and you and yours are in my thoughts and prayers for the speediest and most pain-free recovery possible.
Glad you're feeling better, please take care of yourself. I'll freely admit that I'm selfish, and prefer a world with you producing excellent videos in it opposed to one where you're not. But as long as you're asking, I really do miss the what makes this song great series. I saw your short on Tears for Fears, I think they deserve the full video, if you're up for it.
Great to hear your back o'l dog !!  No worries, get your rest and see you back on the Tube when you feel rested and well.  One request. Could you explore the song by Allan Holdsworth called "Rani Taxi".  It was off a John St James compliation album. I've never heard a song so beautiful and complex.  Still to this day.
Thank you Rick. I’m glad you got on top of your health issue. Keep those great videos coming!!
Hello Rick. Glad that the surgery went well and that you are on the road to recovery. Now then, I have a song or songs request for you. Have you ever looked into the Cardigans? I would love to hear your take on the music. It is absolutely outstanding.
You are a treasure. Glad all is working out. ❤
Remarkable! Glad you're healing smoothly!
God bless ❤❤
My daughter had surgery at the Clinic to repair a DSV when she was 4 months old.  24 years later she's doing great.  Let me know next time your in C-Town!
Glad you're doing well. My son had heart surgery last summer and will have another next year.   I like the interviews. Very few interviewers can talk shop with these artists. The interviews are a record of their expertise and artistry that should be studied.
Nice to see you're doung well. Abrazo desde México, hermano.
Glad to see your doing well 👍
Recuperate pronto Rick! Saludos desde Argentina!!!
Good to see you back in the game.
That's incredible you're in such an amazing state just days later! 😳 Heart surgery is no small thing. Glad you made it 😄👍🏻
Glad you're doing well! I've been a cardiac nurse for a long time and been around for many MV repairs! I see you're still a bit hoarse from the intubation!  Keep on getting better! 👏
Health and quick recovery, Rick.  As for feedback, missing What Makes This Song Great!
Congratulations ❤ glad to hear it was successful!
Glad you are recovering well Rick, personally, I look to your videos for the technical intricacies of making music and also you have a great knack for asking the most insightful questions in your interviews with artists. Stay wall, may you be as blessed as you are as blessing
Happy you had successful surgery and are looking as vital as ever!
Glad to hear you’re recovering well.
I'll bet his micro-valve was a microphonic 12AX7. 😊 Glad you're doing better! God bless 🙏
Glad you got a valve job and it all went well, should have asked them to port the intake to, increase the HP ;)
Feel Good Rick. All the best from Cape Cod!
Glad you're on the mend!  Really love your videos.  As far as the direction of the channel, the longer interviews are great, but I don't always have time to watch them through.  Some shorter 5-10 minute song analysis vids peppered in between would be amazing!
Keep on rockin' Rick\m/
Glad you're doing well Rick!
Glad you are doing well Rick! ❤
For your assessment of the channel…do whatever most interests you. It’s gotten you millions of followers and the respect of many music artists and industry professionals.
Glad you are doing good Rick.  A life event such as your surgery is profound. We come out of it sailing high on the other side, but that little voice inside us says - "what do I want to do different?", "how can I make my work better?".  Fact of the matter is your channels are fantastic, just keep mixing it up with interviews and breakdowns of songs in different ways.  We all love the content you put out :). Stay well!!!
Get well soon, Rick! Better leave the Les Pauls in their stands with that weight restriction. 😊
Glad you're doing well. As far as your ? About the direction of the channel. I don't have any. Like what you're doing. If it's not broke don't try to implement some unnecessary fix
Go, RICK!!  WE LOVE YOU!!!
I had a great dermatologist who once said:  jack: Im going to give you the best advice a doctor can give to a patient. I said:  Whats that Dr Wolf? He said: Stay away from doctors!
Thanks for Sharing Rick Glad all went well. Best of health for the future also. 😊
Glad you did so well with the surgery. Here's to many more happy, healthy years for you.
We all appreciate you and love you Rick no doubt. So Rick Beato for a long time garanteed !!!! Yessss GOD bless you, Rick, and we are blessed for having a so kind person as you are. Greetings from CHILE 🍷🍷🍷🍷
Better lay off the Les Pauls if you have a 10 lb lift limit! 😂 Best to ya man!
I had a check up today & I am doing well, too, so I can relate to feeling that kind of elation. It puts you in such a good mood. These are the things that matter. Good health so you can do the things you love.
Love ya!
Just do NOT lift one of those heavy Les Pauls 🎉😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Loving the interviews Rick, would love to see you interview Neil Finn
Absolutely wonderful. Your music knowledge and interview style is just so appreciated. Congratulations on your successful operation. Keep cool, practice just a little self restraint …
So glad things worked out! stay Healthy!!
I am 40 and had my aortic valve repaired two years ago and never had any symptoms or issues whatsoever. Glad you’re doing fine.
Fantastic.  Good to see you up and about Rick.  Looking good.
Yikes, I'm due for a similar procedure at the end of the month, but glad to hear it went well and I'm hoping for the same. Keep on beating, Rick!
I strongly wish you an amazing recovery and all the best! ❤
Chillax.   Defo stay way from drugs and booze.   Not sure if they are your thing but regardless you need to let your body heal.  All the best.
I have probably watched every video on your channel but have never commented.  I was born in 1962 as well, and this totally caught me off guard as I never realized you had any health issues. I'm very happy to know that things went well and glad you are on the mend, Rick. Peace brother man.
Keep away from the heavy Les Pauls.  Thanks for sharing so much of your life.
Very happy that you're okay. Take care of yourself Rick.
So glad you're ok!! ❤
So happy for your successful surgery and recovery!  All the best to you and yours—-you are loved❤
good to know youre OK
Glad you're back Rick. Godspeed on a full recovery and new lease on life
Glad the surgery went well and you’re feeling good.
Good stuff, Rick. Glad everything went well.
You imply that your valve was repaired, that is great!  Better a repair to your own tissue, than a pig or metal valve. And the associated maintenance that goes with valve replacement.
kickstart my heart ....
All the very best Rick, love and best wishes from England
Looking forward to more “what makes this song great”
Great news Rick! So glad everything went so well.
Dude, you are magic to sooo many people - glad everything went well, and you're on the mend!🤘👍
DO NOT LIFT ANYTHING! That's the main side effect of surgery, cutting through your muscles. You'll forget and regret lifting. Glad you're good.
Welcome Back...
Great to see you looking so well ! Top man
So glad you're still with us. May you heal well.🙏🏼
Get fully healed Rick! ❤
Do i make real music richard
Congrats on your successful surgery.
Hella good painkillers if they cracked your chest a week ago and you're feeling this good!  Glad you're still alive.
✌️Thank you Rick for all that you do. Both you and your channel are appreciated beyond words. Stay well  and rock on 🤘
Glad your doing well!
You're amazing, Rick! So glad your surgery went well. Really enjoy the content of your videos! ❤️🤗🤟🎶🎸
Sounds like time for a Zipper tattoo
Love your posts, Rick. Keep positive. I'm 74 this year and had a pacemaker fitted last year. I play football (soccer) three times a week (but it wipes me out) so do what the doctors tell you and you'll be okay.
Glad to hear about the good outcome and that the procedure went so well.  Was your condition a congenital defect or something you grew into?  Your appearance suggests you've lost a little weight.  Are you on any kind of diet or physical therapy?  We're a few blocks away from a Cleveland Clinic Hospital in Florida.  While one can't assume they are getting world class cardio care anywhere except the Cleveland, OH facility, I assume you would place trust in them if circumstances led one to use their services?
All the best wishes from germany...
Great to see you back in the studio Rick and looking great man! Welcome back ❤
Glad to hear you're doing well with your health - so am I! From one ol' dog to another ol' dog - All the best, Mike.  PS. I'm limited to lifting only 20 lbs., it's been over 6 months now.
A friend of mine is a PhD nurse at the Cleveland Clinic.  They do wonderful things there.
Glad you're well. You look great brother. I've read and experienced in my family where this kind of surgery can create some depression issues. Praying you stay well physically and mentally. You had mentioned before about working with NEEDTOBREATHE on the first couple of albums. I would love to see videos of you and those you've worked with before to discuss the process, and if you would do anything different on those records. Or touching base with Brent Smith of Shinedown, and many more. More importantly, you do you man. Love your content.
Interviews are great! Glad you’re feeling better and are optimistic & pleased so far!
Wow Rick!❤ Thanks for sharing! We ALL wish you a speedy recovery!👍👍
My D-I-L probably worked on you as a nurse.  The pride of Cleveland: The Cleveland Clinic.  Glad all is well.  Looking forward to more music.  I've learned so much from you.
Rick, there's no way we get back to better music in this culture without music education and by extension informed, thoughtful music criticism. What you're doing is  invaluable to that end. Keep going as long as you can, but most definitely not as hard as you've been going.
You made me look and hear music differently. Now i understand that making music is an art. So thanks and keep it up and ofcourse in good health.
Amazing stuff Rick, just relax, play guitar and chill out. All the best from across the pond in the uk ❤️
Thankful you made it out of surgery safely!!!
Keep grinding! Love the channel, heal quickly.
Wonderful to hear that you are doing well in your recovery! And thank you so much for describing the procedure; I'm sure it's helpful to others who know of someone who had this or may need one themselves in the future. Take good care!
Glad you are alright and received such excellent medical care!
Welcome back, Rick! We’re so glad you’re feeling better 🤟🏾
I'm so glad your surgery was successful. All the best!
Glad you're ok.  But...  I have a long-term condition as well (we're same age).  My rule, with doc concurrence: if there are no life-wrecking symptoms, live with it.  Everybody has something wrong, bodies (or minds).  Accept and live with it until you live anymore.  Never submit to surgery as a 'lifestyle improvement' activity.  It's expensive (easily 200K$, especially at the Cleveland Clinic) and risky.  By all means go-for-the-knife if your life is over without it.  You agreed to open-heart surgery because you were "tired in the afternoon"?  I'm not you, I don't know what you mean by "tired".  But wow.  Did you get a 2nd and 3rd opinion? (you never said so, I'll presume yes).    Again, no offense, glad you're up and going.  BTW, you should do a Heart review.  Maybe interview Ann and Nancy (or Steve Fossen, or Howard, Roger)!  Best 80s' band among great 80s bands.
Glad you're doing well Rick. Big love x
Glad your good Rick.
What ever you do keep doing interviews. I long for them all the time. Yours is one of the very few shows that doesn’t suck! Even the most popular podcasts are way past their prime and now suck! The interview side of your channel feels like it’s still in its infancy with all the potential in the world!! Glad you’re ok!
Glad to see you appear to be doing well!!  Love ya and your channel Rick and you'll be around for decades to come brother.  You have a big heart!!!  No pun intended.
Glad everything went so well and you're feeling good. 👍
Keep rocking man!!
Glad all went well and you feel a bit better already. I'm sure you'll notice the difference even more after another couple of weeks.  As to channel direction, you know what I'd like to see- more of your views on the charts :)
Wishing you fullest health Rick. Thank you for your channels and your materials. They've become such a part of my and I know many many others' lives.
Can't lift anything over 10lb.  So no playing Les Pauls for for a while
Welcome back Rick! Good to see ya all healthy and such.
Great news Rick. I know you’re feeling good, but still, don’t overdo it. I’m 62 too, it can be easy to think we are as strong as we have always been and very often we are, but after something like this, there’s no harm in easing off a bit. I’m not talking about stopping, just erring on the side of caution for a short while. Cheers and thank you for your excellent channel!
Nothing over 10 pounds, so no old Les Pauls? 😅 All the best ❤
No boat anchors for a few weeks then Rick.  Best wishes for a full recovery!!!
Heal Well! For the suggestion box. How about a look at  SRV's Riviera Paradise??
Rick. Take it easy regardless of how your feeling.   Fart around on the keys and use that pillow that they gave you😊
So pleased for you Rick😊
3 favored tracks from random artists and why would be fun.
Master Rick, is a great news about your recuperation and welcome back , blessings and congratulations.
get well brother!
Wonderful news… speaking from my own experience after open heart… You may experience unexplained rage or impatience. They call that pump head. Just be aware of it and deal with it.
Glad everything went well, looking good a week out.
Rick, I had robotic mitral valve repair 12 years ago. Today I’m in the best shape of the last 30 years. Anything you need to know regarding my recovery please don’t hesitate to contact me.
I've been praying for you.  SO glad to see how well you are doing only 1 week out of surgery.   Thank you for all you do and for how you inspire, educate and elevate musicians.  Thanks for the update as well.  I may love the interviews best but seeing you feeling well tops it all.  Thanks Rick.
😀✌🙏
Glad surgery went well ❤
Time to interview members of HEART and/or breakdown "Magic Man."
Get well soon, and may God bless & heal you. Greetings from Nova Scotia, Canada. 🇨🇦
Keep on Rockin’ and educating us, Rick! Greetings from Colombia, South America. 🇨🇴
Glad your heart is doing better and the surgery went excellent. It wasn't a surprise and I'm glad you got a great doctor. Great doctors make all the difference in care.   Regarding thoughts for the channel, the only thing I'd say is I love the "top 10" reactions. Those are fun.
Glad to see your back and feeling better  :-)  Peace
Hey Rick - Cleveland guy here. Next time you're in town for open heart surgery we should do dinner - I know all the great spots!
I'm so glad you're okay. God bless you with His love & healing.
I’m sure glad The CLE did you right!!! Hope you heal fast!!!
So glad you got it handled and you’re doing well! God Bless you buddy! ❤
Stay healthy Rick!! Good to see you up and running 😊
Glad to see you out of the hospital! I love all your content.  The interviews have been lots of fun, but your theory song breakdowns are also interesting.
Get well soon Rick
I'm so glad you're doing well, Rick!!
Excellent news Rick! Hope you're soon up to all your old tricks!  Beautiful that you ask us to chip in with ideas, while you have a moment of reflective mode ... So that may mean you'll be up to new tricks soon!  You probably have already done a video highlighting The Smile's initiation and 2 first albums. If so, it's one I haven't seen yet. If not, can't wait!
🙂🙏
Wish you the best of health and trouble free recovery. At my 74 years of age , I know that road. Stay well friend.
Welcome to the club, I also have the scar.  Glad it was sucessful.  Just take it easy for awhile.  Sternum takes longer to heal than the skin will.  I, unfortunately, just bad luck, had a dog run through my legs that knocked me down rather hard and aggrivated my sternum.  Made me wish I just stayed in my Wheelchair.
So glad everything turned out fine!
Glad to see you well and ‚back to normal‘ - as the pictures a few days ago where really scary ! All the best and please keep doing what you’re doing (so enjoyably well) !
Love ya, Rick! Speedy recovery! ❤️‍🩹
Hey Rick,Im a music consultant for the music industry for about 6 years now and also have some kind of heart issue that still needs testing BUUT I really enjoy your videos, and im glad to see you back and on the mend.! Your videos are very inspiring.
Welcome back big boy! 👍🏼👍🏼💪🏼💪🏼😎😎
So glad you’re doing well. Really enjoy your channel. Blessings to ya.
Best of luck!  Glad you're looking and feeling better.
heal well, Rick... all the best...
Get well soon!
Glad you're Ok Rick, Greatest channel ever !
This man turned a joke into a series with hope, despair, loss and hype. He deserves every bit of recognition he has and even beyond that
I'll take as many 5 years-es  as my doctor will give me.  GL Mr. Beato.
Wow! Take care, Rick, and I'm glad you're feeling OK!
I'm here for whatever content you wanna put out. If it helps you decide, it definitely was those "what makes this song great" and reaction videos to "spotify top 10" that first pulled me to the channel.
Buffalo and all of Western New York wish you a speedy recovery. You are the best and one of the remaining shining lights on YouTube. Enjoy chillin'. Best.
So happy you're doing okay Rick! I'm 66 and I get tired in the afternoons as well, never thought anything about it. Maybe I should check into it. So happy all is well! I watch you channel almost daily. 👍😎✌🏼
Glad you are still here.
So much love and gratitude for you.
Take it easy!
May you be happy, healthy, and blessed. A new life. I personally love you breaking down a song and showing what makes the song great.
Glad you're doing well. My mom had that. She got an artificial mitral valve.
Thank God for medical miracles! I’m thankful you are doing well.
Wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery Rick.
Great to know you’re okay! Keep up the good work, don’t change anything.  Best greetings from Finland ☀️
Glad you are doing well post-op Rick. Love your talent, friends, music and stories!!!
Much love from Norway🇧🇻 Good to know more videoes are coming👍
Thanks for the update Rick, we care and glad it went well! My brother-in-law had the same surgery that was successful as well.
Get well Rick
Besides the regular content you post, this is a PSA for a lot of folks. You could literally be a lifesaver for someone. Continue serving your fans.
Yikes, glad to see you recover so quickly.  Always looking forward to your incredibly diverse content!
you dont look any worse for wear! I'm glad to hear you're doing well now.
That's amazing! So glad you're back better than ever! Hugs and continued good health! xoxo
I really want to see Courtney Love and Eric Erlandson on here. Or any of the Banshees. More women.
So glad you're still on the planet...YOU are such a treasure.
Hang in there Rick ... You and I are the same age. The "Parts" unfortunately start to wear out about now. Great to see Everything went Well 👍
Happy to have you back! Great job all doctors and nurses!👏
Rick, have you ever thought about doing breakdowns of the most powerful movie music ever written? Why its so good, why it so matches the mood of the movie, how it carries the movie along etc. etc.
Thank God you're back and good. We need you a lot ❤
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Take Care Rick.. Greetings From Australia 🇦🇺
we are all made of scars Rick, take care of yourself! hug! (gentle)
Glad all went well and you're back on the studio!
I’m facing left upper lobectomy tomorrow (7/23).  Last May I was hospitalized for pneumonia and my pulmonologist found a malignant Adenocarcinoma on my lung.  Im not a smoker.  I’m not symptomatic, it’s early and a chance find. The greatest chance for 100% recovery is the lobectomy..somehow, I’m not nervous.  Im 71.
this is amazing, YOU are amazing, best wishes keep safe :)
I am glad everything is going well. Take care of yourself we need you.
Rick, now you are a family member.
Glad it went well Rick! Thanks for letting us know and take it easy for the next few months.
Glad you are on the mend Rick. God bless!
First I heard of this, and glad you are doing so well! I really love your takes on musical subjects, because you ask the questions of interviewees and answer the questions that musicians would likely have about most topics, not necessarily just the average music listener might have. I had blood clots in my lungs in 2011 at age 55 and got 5 stents in 3 locations in 2 arteries in 2016. All of that went incredibly well, and I haven't had a problem since, although I did essentially quit eating meat except on rare occasions on the advice of my doctor. Keep doing what you are doing, and if you wonder if a subject is going to be as interesting to your audience as it is to you, you can feel confident that it more than likely is! ✌👍👍
Glad to see you came through it all in spades. My son had a similar procedure 3 times in his 47 years; the first time when he was 2 months in this world! It’s amazing what modern doctors can do, and it seems that they have pulled you through too. Peace-
Be well, Rick Beato. 🐿🐿🐿🐿
heal well Rick ..
All my prayers. Get better!!
Best wishes.
Rick, glad everything went well and that you're on the mend.
Welcome to the zipper club Rick!!
Glad the surgery was a success, Rick ❤
You are Blessed!
Glad you're doing well, Rick!
It's great to see you're well!
Glad all is good Rick ! 🎸🎶🙏
They cracked your chest? Why no robots?
Glad you're doing well. Now just do as the doc says.
"For those who are curious...". People care dude, immensely. Happy to see you're well
My dad had a leaky aortic valve replaced when he was 72 and came through without a hitch. He had a heart pillow just like the one in your picture. So glad you're healing well!
glad your back rick keep on keeping on
Been there Rick , know what you're going through;Had two valves replaced; Take it easy. Your You Tube casts have made me listen to music in a much better way!
Very glad to see you make a great recovery. As for direction of the channel, I'm missing the "What Makes This Song Great" series, but I wouldn't trade it for the excellent interviews you've had on the channel.
I'm glad you are feeling healthy!
Thanks!
Im glad you are OK ! IM a big fan
These kind of things are private, thanks for being open and honest and sharing with us.
Best of luck Rick.  I watch your channel a lot and always enjoy it.  I have the same "zipper" after aortic valve replacement so just take your time and don't push it.  Take care!!
so glad it worked out for you! Same surgery ended up killing my dad. 😞
Rick, so happy to hear you are feeling better.  Wishing you many more years of enjoying life and pursuing your passion.  You’re a good man and we all enjoy you sharing with us.
Glad everything went well. Everyone in my family here in the Cleveland area has had positive experiences with the Clinic. To address your question specifically, I think the channel is at its best when it’s focused on the state of music and the industry overall, where it’s been, where it’s going, trends, physical media vs streaming, etc, which distinguishes it from most of the other music-oriented content. That’s the kind of music talk that spurs ongoing debate and discussion among people. The interviews are a bonus and well-done, and the occasional song breakdown, lists, favorites and best-of videos are fun as well. The topics available for those are virtually unlimited.
Congrats boss.
Hi Rick I am 63 1/2 and boy are there challenges and changes to our body. Also thank god for anesthesia and of course a good anesthesiologist. Most importantly you had a great cardio thoracic surgeon. So happy you are doing well. Going forward with suggestions I know episode 104 I have watched it an embarrassing number of times. However any additional videos on Pink Floyd’s Time and Comfortably Numb would be great. Looking forward David Gilmour’s new Album is coming out in September his daughter’s voice is amazing. Haven’t heard the other songs because they have not been released. I think you will have a lot of material to evaluate and break down. I am going to Madison Square Garden to see him. I accidentally bought too many tickets. You probably have many connections but I would give you a platinum seat no charge on me 😊. Any have a speedy recovery because you are irreplaceable ❤
So much love and respect, Rick!
Glad everything went well.  Your health is the most important thing.  If you don't have that you don't have anything.  All the best.
Glad your doing great. I have the same scar(five bypass). Looking forward, I would love to see you get Alex or Geddy on for an interview.
Severe mode is greek too? ;) Jk, Rick. Glad you're OK. By the by, the Kenny Aronoff interview? Best one you did yet. Fantastic stuff!
Glad to see you’re doing ok Rick. Rock on brother 💯💪
You look great! Looks like you lost some weight. I'd love to hear your weight loss secret if you have any.
Rick, I’m so glad your surgery went well and that you seem to be recovering so quickly!  Wishing you continued speedy and thorough healing.
Love your work and your attitude. Bless you.
Jolly good show !
Thank you for sharing your experience, happy to hear you are recovering quickly
So glad you're ok!
be careful picking up those les pauls man
That's a quick recovery, but take your time, don't rush anything.  That afternoon tiredness you felt is what I feel every day, all day for the last 24 years because of a chronic illness I got after I was bitten by a deer tick.  Some days I get up at the crack of 2 and it feels like I've never slept.  There are few things I can do now, like watching YouTube videos such as yours; thanks for the entertainment and music lessons; I'm more of a slightly advanced amateur guitar/ piano player, but when you're tired it's hard to get motivated to pick up the guitar regularly.  Again thank you for your video, best of health to you, and remember to take it easy.
Rick!!! I'm glad you're doing great and that your surgery went as successful as you're telling us. Replying to your request: I love your interviews, they're quite enlightening, but for me, where I've learned and loved the most of your channel is the song breakdowns! WMTSG is what really got me hooked to your channel back in the day!
You do the best interviews Rick, so please continue to bring us lots more of those!  You look great and I am glad you are feeling good, welcome back☺
“What makes this song great?” Please do more of these videos.
Glad your ok get well soon
prayers for you Rick, keep the videos coming
Glad you’re feeling better.😊
bonne chance!
Sending good vibes Rick!!
Listening to auto-tune-bs can/will make you sick .. i presume. Stay healthy ...  enjoy a daily dosis of Bach 😄
Rick glad youre feeling better. Interview with Geddy Lee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great News !!
Glad you’re doing well Rick!
I wish all the best for your health, Rick!
I have loved the interviews - some of them have been among the best I have ever watched - but please don't neglect the song break-downs too - you make the songs come alive with your insight and enthusiasm and they are literally national treasure level stuff for me.
stay well and godspeed to recovery.
Glad you are back in the seat!
We love you Rick. The direction of the channel should be whatever you need / want it to be - whatever form you choose, you will always be contributing to helping people fall in love with music all over (again). I for one thoroughly enjoy your in-depth interviews because, as a music fan first and a music pro second, you make a brilliant interviewer who really lets your counterparts' character and ingenuity shine through.
So great to hear, Rick. Best wishes from London. You’re the man.
So glad you´re recovering well. God bless!
So happy to see that you’re recovering so well.
Happy to hear you are doing fine Rick
Rick = 100% honesty. Keep going man!
Glad you're doing well.
Get well soon!
Glad to hear you are doing well and have clearly been in good medical hands, Rick! As the deluge of messages on this video show, you are hugely appreciated
Welcome to the zipper club!
Did fixing your valve improve your tone?
Me alegra que estés recuperándote. Me gusta mucho tus análisis sobre canciones, las entrevistas son increíbles, pues me apasiona ver los procesos creativos y sobre todo me recuerda volver a escuchar discos y canciones de nuevo para redescubrir muchos detalles que has mencionado. Escribo en español pues me cuesta menos trabajo y se que los traductores son relativamente buenos. Gracias por compartir tus conocimientos y tu pasión por hacer, escuchar y crear música. Uno es más modesto pues yo no puedo distinguir que nota es cuál cuando la escucho, pero en un piano la encuentro con relativa facilidad y después la paso a el acorde que busco en la guitarra, pues aprendí  con amigos a tocarla, a diferencia del piano que tome clases. Gracias y que bueno que vayas mejor.
Glad you are recovering well .. love your channel Rick .. Good health,  best wishes from Ireland 🇮🇪
So glad you're fully on the mend! The music world needs you around for the loooong haul.  P.S. "Severe Regurgitation" is gonna be my new band name.
Yep, I've got valves they're watching too. But hey, we live in magical times.  Best wishes for your recovery!
No LP...too heavy😂
So glad you’re doing well!
Good to see you got the tires rotated!! I love your artist interviews. I miss hearing your life stories. You have great personal stories that give people perspective.
Keep going, Rick!
Glad you feel better Rick!!
Rock on, Rick!
I just recently recovered from TWO heart surgeries to repair a hereditary dissection of my aorta  (upper and lower).  My younger brother died in 2020 because his condition went undetected. My Dad with the same condition lived to 93 -- so I'm hopeful!    All the best wishes and prayers to you, Rick in your recovery--  Keep Rockin'
Just stopping by to say God bless you and you look great, our dear brother in music!
Begin to worry when they say stuff like "....people YOUR age...."  Just like fixing a screen door. Glad you are back "in the pink"
All the best Rick, make sure you get your rest and recovery in! God bless.
That's great, Rick. I had open heart valve surgery (Aortic & Pulmonic) 25 years ago and can relate to your amazement of being up and walking around so quickly. But there's no doubt about it, it definitely puts things in perspective. Keep on pickin'!
what makes song great, 'new religion' or 'the chauffeur' by duran duran. I love the song break downs 😏
Glad you're doing well, Rick.  Look forward to whatever you come up with in the future.
Enjoy your new zipper!
Happy to hear it was successful for you. Ease your way back!!!
Mix it up i love everything you do. So glad your surgery was a success
Glad to hear all went well Rick, and wish you a speedy recovery! Thanks for what you do!
Feel better Rick.
Since the heart was restarted, you have 62 more years to go, right?
Just do what makes you happy, Rick! Have a pleasant & successful recovery! 💖🎵
No lifting an 11 lb Les Paul. Light Tele's for now. Wishing you a speedy and complete recovery. 🎉🎉
Glad to hear you're back up and feeling better! I had quintuple bypass surgery back in 2004, and it took me a while to feel better again.
Rick, we love you. Very happy things went well. Us gray hairs STILL rock!
Healing and peace feel better soon
Glad you're back and healthy!
Great to see you are as well as I am from having my heart fixed, Artificial Valve take care
You look as AMAZING as ever.  SO happy you are feeling well and you can continue with your everyday life.  LOTS of love from Québec!  :)
Im happy that youre ok and doing well🌠🤗
Best recovery😊😊😊😊
Get well soon Rick.  Best wishes from the UK.
Wishing and praying for your speedy recovery and sustained health, Sir!
You look fantastic and strong Rick. You must have some very healthy Italian genes. So glad all went well. Lots of love.
What makes these song great? Heart of gold, Straight from the heart, Total eclipse of the heart, Hungry heart, You're in my heart...lol But seriously, glad your doing well Rick!
Rick,so glad you’re recovering well, I am sending healing prayers from Hollywood ! Your the best thing going on you tube, I personally love your “what makes this song great” content but i think your entire ecosystem is fantastic.including your teaching materials and ear training program.  I credit you for inspiring me to get back into this side of the music business and I’ve improved as a musician and songwriter because of your dedication to the content and how you present it. You (and music)have helped keep me sane in these crazy times. Another commenter said you’re a national treasure and i agree, just don’t let it go to your head.LOL Rock on Brother! Erick Brennan
You look wonderful!!!!
Dude, take care of you. I am glad you seem to be on the mend and in great spirits. Here's to a healthy Rick. P.S. My Dad had his little red pillow after his open heart surgery
I am so glad the surgery was a success! I'm glad you're back and eager to keep making music more enjoyable for so many of us. I've enjoyed the channel in each direction you've wandered down. Lately the video of the concert mixer...(insert correct name here) has been my favorite- certainly I don't have an ultimate favorite- WHAT MAKE THIS SONG GREAT hooked me in. I look forward to the next big thing you decide to try! Keep up the great work, and pay attention to your doctor!
I'm 69, Rick, and I started playing guitar again , last year, being motivated by your positive attitude. I wish you all the best ! Greetings from Belgium.
So very glad you're doing better and are on the mend. Stagger ever onwards, rejoicing!
Praying for you brother
You're looking well, and glad the surgery went according to plan. Best of health to you, and looking forward to more interviews etc.
I'm so happy to see you're ok
My mother had a valve replacement about ten years ago and she’s doing great! Glad you are healing up and take it easy ❤❤❤❤
Cheers from Diamantina-MG Brazil!
Glad to hear that you’re on the mend
I’m glad you’re ok.  Thanks for all your hard work!
Love From India you are pure Gold..God bless. God speed
God bless you 🙏
*big huggz* 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Glad you got the surgery done, Rick!  Continued prayers for your good health!  🙏👍🙂❤
An amazing story and recovery. Huge congrats to you and your medical team.
you showed me Bach thank you
Selfishly, I was hoping you might comment more on this topic since I saw your IG post, as I'm in the "you'll need surgery in 5-7 years" camp myself with my cardiologist for mitral valve regurgitation (I'm 47). Glad to hear it was a really positive experience for you - it's really helpful to see other patients with great outcomes and I'm glad you are doing well too!
So you've got a groovy new healthy beat in your heart? Alright.
Well done, Rick! Wishing you a full recovery and many more years of singing and celebrating music for us, with us, among us.
Congratulations on your recovery, Rick. I too am a budding doctor and have been following your channel for 3-4 years now. I play the guitar and have learnt a lot from your video lessons and song breakdowns. Keep doing what you're doing and I wish you all the very best to you and your family.
Take care yourself Rick beato, i love your work as a youtuber and as a person.
I’m in my late 50s, and worked in studios in the late 80s into the 90s. I fell ill with a life changing illness, and turned away from everything. YOU Rick, turned me back on to the depth, breadth and also the simple enjoyment of music ….You helped me, and if nothing else, you are very much appreciated, I truly wish you a speedy recovery…Love from the UK❤
I'm glad you're feeling better. God be with you while you heal..
Glad you are ok, went through quad bypass open heart last September, blessed to still be here and back as well. God Bless you.
So glad to see you! Thank you for all of you doing!❤
Happy to see you’re doing well after the surgery Rick! I'd love to see more interviews with musicians/producers/studio engineers from the 90s :). Keep it up look forward to more videos!!
Please, be here as long as me. Lots of love from Brazil.
All the love in the world to you Rick. ❤️
I had the same procedure almost 9 years ago but with the addition of a double bypass. You came out of it way better than I did, as I didn't feel great for about 3 months, and I couldn't play the guitar following the operation. (And I couldn't play before either!) Glad it went well for you. It's a big operation.
Glad everything is ok!! Best luck
All the best to you, Rick. You're a much loved legend . Much love to you and your family. ❤🎉
So very thankful for your contribution to our music community! The absolute best at what you bring… musical JOY!!  Warm regards, Jack Allen Smith
I'm glad that you are doing well.
❤🌞☯️🙏 from France 🇨🇵
Glad you are doing well.
👍🎸66 here I have flutter/ Afib. wouldn't believe it until fatigue ramped up. I've had an ablation which worked. Glad you make this so open. That helps people who might try to ignore signs. Heal well sir.
Thankful that the surgery went well! Sending Big Love to you and your family. Speedy healing!
Welcome to the Pillow Hugging Club... Had my Aortic Valve replaced twice...
The interviews are GREAT Rick. Especially the ones with Producers/Engineers. I learn A LOT from those videos. Keep doing what you're doing.
Glad that you're in shape. Thanks for sharing your knowledge
I get tired in the afternoon too. I just havea nap! ;-)
You look good, man. Stay healthy. Keep on rocking! 🎸
Glad to hear you are in good health rick, much love from the u.k. 🤟🤟🤟
Glad you're doing so well Rick.
It’s insane how fast you’ve recovered. Got split open and a measly week later you’re normal. Science yo.
Get well soon 🙏
So glad you got that successfully done, and you are okay!  my dad a had a pig's heart valve put in to replace one for something very similar, and it took a longer time for him to recover to that level.
Well done mate.  Love from London.  Keep on keeping on!
Next phase of the channel. Be encouraging. Be a voice of Love and support. Even more. Talk to all kinds of people about their process… not just famous people. Maybe visual artists too maybe who do album covers . Interview people with home studios, even bare bones ones. To contrast with the big name million dollar studios. The main thing,,, over and over, tell people to use what they have. (…Even just three open chords) dont be afraid to “not be good”. Time is short. Aloha, eric
Happy to see you back Rick! Have a good recovery.
We've never met, but I've watched enough videos of yours that if we were to meet, I'd probably greet you like a friend I've not seen in a while.  So for my part, I hope and wish you have a speedy recovery!  I enjoy what you say, your perspective on the industry overall and share many of your opinions...just don't ask me to play anything...  :)
Much Love Rick!!! Take it easy please.... Recuperation is no joke...
Interesting Thanks for the update! Wish you a fantastic recovery.
Hope you make a quick and full recovery Rick!
Heart lung bypass machine AKA the autotune for the heart. Isn't technology grand.
So happy the procedure went well.  We're all wishing you the best in recovery.
I am really  happy you are ok!
Wow ...get well.
Stay away from the Les Pauls for a while.
The Cleveland clinic is where Favaloro developed the cardiac bypass! As an Argentinian I'm very proud.
Glad that you’re back and in good health….now let’s get back to the Music!!!!
God bless you with long and productive life Rick! Wish you and your family all stay healthy and safe.  BTW, song breakdowns and WMTSG series are most welcome!😄
Wishing you a speedy recovery Rick!! ❤🙏🏻❤️
♥
Wow, who knew, Rick? I'm not a fan of American medicine, in general, but surgeries like this are nothing short of miraculous.  God bless you. I'm glad you're recovering well.
I've had my mitral valve replaced (in 2010) with a mechanical valve. Since then life has been good.  Need to take 6mg pill of coumadin every day, but that's just routine.  The odd thing is that i remember you doing a show a while back on your periodic tinnitus, and I went through that too around last summer. Now physio therapy seems to work for that...very slowly. We seem to be two music guys with valve issues and blocked ears --good luck Rick
Glad you're doing well, Rick, and wish you a full recovery soon. I really enjoy your videos even though I'm not a musician.
God Bless you and get well soon. Love your podcasts.
I’m not a musician, don’t play an instrument, carry my tunes in a bucket, can’t read a note, BUT I can tweak audio devices to a fare the well. Don’t even remember how I stumbled into your channel way back when, but I love it. Not only has my library exploded, but I have a keener interest and knowledge in how it’s constructed. That makes it easier to know what to listen for in a recording. This should be a required channel for self professed audiophiles. While I do like the deconstruction of songs, the interviews are so great. Only the musicians really know their intent.  I’ve heard several references especially to Bach (I’m not that ignorant) which makes me wonder if you could construct a shorter arc. Pick a target song, then follow its elements back to predecessor constructs from the early rock era. It would also be fun to get your take on why certain types of songs generate monster revenue despite having no real redeeming musical content.
I had no idea ?! Glad you are doing well !!!
Glad that you are right, waiting for more videos. You are one of the greatest  youtubers, no doubt!!!
Good to know you are ok
Wow, what a success - glad you are back so soon!  Hearts are amazing.  Follow doc’s orders obviously.    I do like your interviews, but I think your song analyses are my favorite.
Happy you're getting better! \o/
Thanks for the update. Glad to hear you're okay, Rick!
Saludos Rick,no sabia, me alegra que estes Aqui.
I have Mitral valve prolapse, it's inherited. my mother had surgery for it about 15 years ago at the Cleveland Clinic.
There are so many interviews I would like to see. Carol Kaye is one of them.
Good to see you Rick. Hopes for all the best and a nice recovery!
I had my Aortic valve and an Aortic aneurysm repaired 3.5 years ago; I am glad you were able to bounce back so quick. I was in ICU for 8 days and 3 more days in the hospital.  It took me about 6 months to recover. Keep up the good work.
"Welcome back"! All the best from London, Uk!
This world of Music and Musicians like me need you more than ever Rick... I have the same heart condition and although I've done decently with stents and a couple of repairs I will have to go with a sort of an implanted defibrilator sub-skin type but I'm not as brave to do an open heart surgery... I don't know but I'm 62-63 like you and I feel the 'integrity' of my body wouldn't withstand that kind of trauma and all the risks that go with it since my case is a bit more complicated than yours. Anyway, I'm just glad that you're doing better and you will continue with the great work you do here and on your teaching page (I've got your 4 course tutorials and I'm also a subscriber) so I want you to stay as healthy as possible. We need you more than ever so music won't fade away as soon as it should... (if you can really consider today's music "music" at all) Hope you get to read my comment and if you don't, My sincerest and earnest wishes to you won't mean less anyway. Best regards my dearest tutor. PhoenixOne
Good to see you're better.
Glad you're ok Rick.
So glad you are on the mend! Wishing you the best! Love the channel like it is , love all the interviews!
I was curious and praying also very glad your surgery was successful.  But, I am also curious as to how your awareness might suddenly be more expansive.  I've been put under three times and each time my awareness is heightened
Get well, Rick!
So thankful! My heart missed a beat seeing your pic there!
Interviews and what makes a song great are what I love most about your channels.
❤
Keep on Rockin Mr Beato !
My sincere best  wishes for you Rick . Your heart has to be good for another 50 yrs. LOL  I'm a subscriber and a huge fan of yours . Warm regards ,  Lou
Rick reminds me my time in clinic, which was awful! Just because i see him losing weight.. i never felt such bad as i was there... So im glad Rick has a good experience! Wish you best, Rick! And thank for great interviews!
Looking good bro....
I wish you a speedy recovery Rick🙏
Happy to see you´re back!
Holy shit Rick. Didn't realize. The thought that you. like all of us, are not gonna be around forever, just breaks my fucking heart to think about (pun only partially intended). In that weird para-social way of the internet, I think I'm just realizing right now that I perhaps love you a little bit. I guess I kinda think of you as my cool musician uncle. Wish I could give you a big old bear hug my friend ❤  Regarding the channel, I miss the theory - especially the plug-and play tricks I can just take and easily apply to my own writing to make it more interesting.  May the force be with you my friend. Best wishes from Copenhagen
Always enjoy your shows and excellent interviews Rick. You always provide a great music-oriented diversion from the increasing troubles of this world!  Wishing you a steady recovery to 100% health!
Awesome Rick. Love you. Take care of your health. I am sure you are itching to get back to 100 percent. You are already at 95 percent here. All the best man
So glad you are feeling better. This is the best channel on YouTube.
Rick, I prayed for your heart, and that God's grace in this matter would only cause you to love Him with all of it.🙏
Glad you're doing well! Thanks for the personal update. Keep on keepin' on!
It's a blessing that you had a good surgeon. So amazing how surgeries can be minimally invasive vs how they used to be.
Glad your ok . I've had a widowmaker my wife jumped on me I was lucky 3.5 years now all is good . So my message to you eat right take all the time you need to feel better cheers to you !
Glad to hear you're feeling ok
Good call Rick! You may get a song out of it!! I will call you next week.🎯
A. Wishing you this is the last surgery and live to 120 in perfect health B. Did anyone here make a playlist of the songs that have a What Makes This Song Great video?
Wishing you a speedy recovery
Glad you're doing well, Rick! You asked, so I'd like more What Makes This Song Great vids where you analyze the original source tracks. Hearing you pull up all the background tracks in More Than A Feeling was one of my favorites. 🙂
Glad your doing well. I have to have this done next year.
Glad to hear everything is ok. Best of luck to you and everyone!
The interviews have been wonderful and insightful but we always love the song breakdowns.
All the best, Rick.
My father had a similar surgery there in 1974.
Thanks for the update, Rick!  Happy to hear that you're recovering well.
I just watched your Kenny Aronoff interview. It kind of just autoplayed after another video, and I probably wouldn’t have watched it otherwise, but it was incredibly engrossing. The level of detail you guys went into about equipment was something, not being a drummer, I didn’t think would hold my attention, but the interview was amazing. I doubt there has been any interview, on the internet or on TV, where so much substantive information about musical learning, creation, and performance has been provided, and in such a way that even someone with little to no knowledge about playing drums would find it as entertaining and enriching as it was. This is great stuff you are doing here. The only thing I can compare it to might be the educational programs Leonard Bernstein or Michael Tillson Thomas have produced in the past.
+ vibes to you Rick. So glad to hear how well you are.
About channel directions, composition lessons? Maybe you can write something for classical guitar? Id love to get my hands on a rick beato original
Glad to know you’re doing well Rick.❤ and looking forward to your new videos. I personally would love to see a Dave Grohl Interview👀
Thank you for being open and transparent with everyone about this stuff - I promise, we appreciate seeing positive perspectives of these kinds of difficulties  You are a beacon of light for us - keep kicking ass! 😉
Godspeed, Rick!  The world needs you a little longer, brother!
I'm glad your feeling well and sounds like your surgery was successful.   As a fellow heart patient I wish you a speedy recovery Rick.  Love your channel and your passion for all things music.  Wish you nothing but the best going forward.   Take care man.  Fly
Congratulations Rick on your resent successful surgery. Do continue with your outstanding channel and keep taking care of your self.
Glad all went well. We need you around for a little while longer.  😉
Hey brother the cleveland clinic is the best. They saved my father's life. You were in the best hands possible. Get well man. 🙏
glad to hear it's success n you're up and about.... keep on keeping on Rick. peace
Best wishes, Rick!
Life is short. Live it. Les Pauls weigh 10lbs+.
Happy to hear it went well. Best wishes Rick. Whatever you upload, I'll watch.
Glad to see you’re doing better Rick. Keep up the good work.
Great update Rick, wishing you a speedy recovery.
If it hasn't been said yet,  Welcome to the Zipper Club! Everything you mentioned about your procedure happened to me in 2015. Take your time in recovery- you will be back to 100% in an average of 4 months.
Long live Rick  !  ❤
The global music community needs you ALIVE, my man. All the best.
Can't lift anything over 10lbs, so no Les Pauls for a while 😂😂😂
Echoing what others have said—we do love ya, Rick! Glad to hear things are going well.
get well Rick!
welll whis you the best love yoy
My Dad had his aortic valve replaced in 2001 and he's still going strong. Ticks like a mechanical watch but he doesn't mind it. Said same as you - woke up after the op and started enjoying the right blood flow. Rest up Rick!
Glad you´re back and looking very healthy
Glad you’re on the mend! Stay well!
If I only had a spare penny,  I would give it to you.  I really appreciate your telling of the tale.  And getting all those other musicians on your show.  I am not an instrument player.  I have had a guitar or two that I picked on. I hear well. I guess I never really tried.  Shit.  I probablly owe you another $20 for the psychoanalis.
Get well soon. Glad you are doing great!
Heal up first! YouTube later. 😅 Hang in there bud! From one old man to another.
Rock on with your socks on, Bro!🖖
Have done Internal Medicine 45 years. I understand. Get well soon. Great news. You will be fine.
Hope u get well soon, mayne! Stay strong!
So glad to hear you're doing well, Rick. Wonderful news.
Godspeed in your continued recovery!
Happy you're doing so well Rick.  All the best!
🙏🏼
I'm also 62 and have had 14 major surgeries; it's part of the deal as we age.  I've loved the interviews, especially the ones I thought wouldn't interest me at all.  I know you're working on it, but my dream interview is still Tom Scholz.  Best wishes during your recovery.
There are many, many people pulling for you Rick. We NEED you and your incredible knowledge and skills. Best wishes from 🇨🇦
So glad you're around to educate and entertain us all.  Thanks Rick! Love to your family...
Good to see you’re on the mend. Heart conditions are scary but the state of the art in Medicare is pretty good nowadays.
Careful Rick,  some of those Gibsons are over 10 pounds, great to see you back, take care
Love you Rick, you’re an inspiration. Heal well my friend.
So glad your up and running again!!! Keep getting better!!!
I think a Les Paul is at 9 lbs
🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
take it easy now and all the best!
I'm glad you're on the mend and feeling good! Stay away from politics! lol
Hey, man, glad that you´re ok. You channel is great, keep up the good job. Take care.
Continue to take care of yourself Beato - you're single-handedly keeping Rock 'n' Roll Alive!!
So glad everything went well! Hope you have a speedy recovery!!!
Love your channel.  Glad to hear you’re on the mend.  ❤❤❤😊
really glad to hear you're doing well rick!
Glad your doing well Rick. Best wishes!  For future videos I would like to know why music is now apolitical and doesn't even talk about current events anymore.
I'm very glad to hear your surgery went well! I once took a family member to Cleveland Clinic for a serious procedure, and they were amazing. As a guitarist, I'd love to see more fretboard / theory videos, like the shorts you produce. Take care!
So glad you are doing well. Take care and listen to your doctors.
Rick, you rock, man. Keep strong.
Glad you are doing well- you look great!
Don’t be such a wimp , we want to see 50 push-ups!!!!!
Glad your back healthier than ever!!! Good rockers never die they just push harder!🤘
Rick, so happy that you have this issue resolved and you are back home recovering
Carry on, Rick! Love your interviews!
Very glad you’re doing better. My wife is 4 months in and still weak but a little better every day.
Videos on bands might be cool, and great moments in great songs of theirs, not necessarily chart toppers. I'd recommend starting with Tool and Brutus, Soccer Mommy... I just want more stuff like What Makes This Song Great. I love seeing breakdowns as it helps me learn.
We love ya Rick. Good to hear your all good ❤
Glad to hear you're on the mend Rick. God bless you.
Wishing you the best Rick, I'm following in your foot steps as I have a leaking Mitral Valve.
Glad you're on the mend Rick. Wishing you all the best
Congrats on the successful procedure. Hope it lasts forever.
Glad it went well and hope it continues. Looking forward to hearing about your stroke from the hospital bills. 😂 Maybe you could help the rest of us old farts out, by making a video about that! [Tip: carnivore diet heals.]
Didn't know about this until now!  So glad you're feeling like yourself after the op.  Looking great and bet you feel a lot better too.  Can't wait to see what comes next in your videos - maybe some of you jamming / composing with some of your session friends would be interesting to watch / listen to?  Thanks for all the effort you put into your channels, it's much appreciated.
SO glad you're ok!!! 😎
So happy it was a great success. Be well and get stronger.
Glad it was a success, ready to see what you do next
So glad you're doing fine, Rick. Do what you gotta do to stay with us for years to come.
God bless you, Rick.
Dude,, All the best to many more heathy years!!
Would love more “what makes this song great” vids! Glad you’re back and healthy! We need you ❤
I had a stem cell transplant at Cleveland Clinic two years.  The doctors and nurses are absolutely great there, some of which I will never forget.  I am still remission but tlmy road to better health has rocky.  I had a stroke last month and I nearly checked out permanently.  I still have troubles speaking and my right side is weak.  I am back to practicing on my bass, just playing scales to get my strength back, but it's a start.  You look good just a week out of surgery and wish you a quick recovery!
Heck yeah! Good for another 3 or 400,000 miles!! 💪💪
Hi Rick.  I’m glad the surgery was successful and you heal up fast. Don’t overdue though. I really liked Council Skies. Any chance you can interview Noel Gallagher?  Thanks.
Rick, just keeping doing what you do. Your videos are bright, exciting spots on otherwise mundane, monothonous days. Thank you and have a speedy recovery!
love you dude - keep making videos !
Hey Rick, had no idea about your condition. You look great, hopefully you feel great and get back to 100% soon my guy
I had dual hernia surgery which is fairly common. The worst part is the lead up to surgery. Especially waiting in the room right before they roll you out.  Afterwards there was recovery, but a sense of relief.  Glad all went well.
Hey man! I had no idea you had heart issues but I am overjoyed you get your Mitral Valve attended to, and a new phase of your life commences. At our age, I´ll be 70 in November, we need to be very aware of bodys and listen to what they tells us. Love your channel and have been a follower for years. Your song breakdowns are a favourite of mine and I hope you continue to do that. Not to seem big-headed, empowered or whatever it´s called these days, I taught myself to listen to music in a way that I could hear all of it at the same time . This was when I was about 22 years old and was a drummer in a rock band, mainly 70´s,  for 5 years hence. I used classical music for that, Mainly Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Haydn. Admittedly it took years to achieve and now I think that my hearing is more precious to me than my eyesight. I am grateful that at my age my hearing remains better than most peoples, even much younger than me. All this to say that I appreciate you channel immensely. Thank you so much.  P.S. It saddens me immensely the very few young people will ever know the difference between sound and music, those that know will get my drift.
Glad you're well,Rick.⭐🌹🔥🌹⭐
Rick, glad you are doing well... You chose the right place to go for your mitral valve issue. A former co-worker of mine had cardiac issues some years back which could have severely limited her ability to carry on a normal life. She was seen and treated at Cleveland Clinic and was back to full activity in no time. Best wishes for continued good health. Carry on, my friend!
Time to get Anne and Nancy Wilson on the channel 😉 (Relieved to hear everything went well!)
Glad to hear you're doing well. Take it easy and rest up. Look forward to see more videos when you are fully recoverred in a few weeks.
Thank God, a great medical team and modern medicine that surgery and recovery went well. My wife had an aortic valve replacement three years ago. Good as new! We love you, Rick. Blessings to you, brother!
I'm not a musician but I love the music.  You've taught me so much!  Please keep on keepin on.
Shame you weren’t old enough for Medicare. With original Medicare and a Supplement, your procedure would have cost you the Part B deductible, of $260, and the rest of your procedure would have been $0 out of your pocket!
It's great to see you bouncing back. I enjoy the interviews , and I would like to see more song breakdowns. stay healthy
Prayers for your complete recovery 🙏🏼
Good to see you again doing what you do. I am glad for you.
So glad you are doing great!
You look great Rick. Good man.  Keep doing what you do and what you love... don't worry about anyone else!  Best wishes   Pete Woodroffe Music UK
Scary to go into hospitals these days with mersa etc... quick recovery Rick. I'm using supplements that jack stem cell production like Sea buckthorn berry powder. 🤗 I would like to see a show on how Microphone companies are competing with Chinese clones. Mic wars!
Happy to hear all is well. Rock on, Rick!
Better than a click-track, Rick keeps on ticking! Much love to you
Feel better Rick! Cleveland Clinic is the best. Love it here
Wishing you good health and a continuing positive recovery
Good to hear your doing better!
Listening to Rick Talk about music is like reading many genres of inlay cards and vinyl gatefold LP's at once. Depth of knowledge is wonderful to listen to. Glad your back Rick. Rock on 🤟
If you have had a mechanical valve fitted then you had better get used to the constant companion of hearing the valve ticking, even other people will notice if their hearing is good. Also if it is mechanical, welcome to the world of blood thinning medications and no more broccoli!
Successful result Rick.  I've been living off of my quad bypass since 2001 now.  Over time I just stopped worrying about it, while observing doctor care.  So DO NOT PANIC.
Glad you're doing better, Rick! We want you to be around for a long time!
:D
Hey Rick! I´m just happy everything went perfect for you. Long life my friend!
Rick, do you know what minor surgery is?  Surgery on someone else.  Glad it went well for you.
I think it's high time to try and examine what makes King Crimson's "Man with an Open Heart" a great song. I'm 54 and have my own heart problems. I find that the best way to cope with it is to do what we really love. It helps.
From your fan base in Mexico City, glad to hear you are fine
🙏🙏🙏 for a speedy recovery
Hi Rick. Great to see that you are well and  back to business. My wife is waiting to do excatly the same procedure and it was very good that she could see  you are so good only a few days after doing it. Thank you very much for your testimony.
Glad you’re doing well, Rick.
Glad you're OK, hope you stick around long enough to talk to Alex and Geddy...about mortality...and music, of course.
Glad to see you are doing well, Rick!
Love the channel, and very happy you got the procedure done and over with. Cheers
I would kill to have more obscure artists that you consider good get a deep dive. It’s probably SEO suicide but nice variety?
Good to see you back, Rick! The Internet is lonely without you.
Prayers for speedy recovery. You are national treasure.
Awesome. Good to hear. 🎉 God bless you Rick , in Jesus name. Amen.
I enjoy your work, glad your feeling better!
I'm just so happy that you are doing well.  Please take care.
So fantastic to see you and hear you as if nothing has happened.  You're a warrior Rick and certainly an ispiration to people with similar health issues who may have trepidation to deal with it; it's important for people with an audience to use it for good - nothing new for you. Brian
Why exactly he could not do it robotically?
over 60 you're going to be tired every afternoon anyway......wait another 10 years....lol......if you can walk 9 miles you're extremely lucky......I envy you....keep on trucking
I have learned so much from your channel!! Please keep up the good work!! All of the best in the days ahead!!
Glad to see that you are well.
God bless you, Rick.
Glad you're well and recovering. I'd love to see more "What makes this song great".
My mom had the same problem with her valve and had it replaced.  She lived another 30 years! She had a mechanical valve, so she needed blood thiners afterwards,  but it definitely worked out.
Hi Rick. I am glad to know you are well. Take care.
Great News! ✌🏻❤️
Happy that everything went ok. Cheers Master Rick!
Rick, the guitarist and one of the songwriters for the band a-ha follows you.  A member of a band that's had one, if not more of the most memorable songs in history, currently has about 24 million monthly Spotify listeners but is largely overlooked in the US, although they played at the Hollywood Bowl and Radio City Music Hall in 2022.  I'm not sure if he'd be interested, but an interview with a musician who lives in relative anonymity in Los Angeles, but has had a 40 year career in the music industry could be quite fascinating.  Glad you're doing well post surgery.
🙏
I'm glad you're well. I learned I have a leaky valve about 20 years ago and have basically ignored it completely, although now that you've put this out there maybe I should go see a doc.
Great to know you're OK. Keep going strong
RICK YOUR THE BEST MY FRIEND, LOVE YOUR WORK DONE WITH SO MUCH PASSION, THE MAN WITH A BIG HEART GOD BLESS YOU FOR ALL THE YEARS OF YOUR ENLIGHTENING SERVICE TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, YES CAPITAL LETTERS IM AM SHOUTING IT OUT LOUD FROM CYPRUS GET THE MAP OUT, IM TWOO HUNDRED MILES WESTOF ISRAEL A GREEK ISLAND. 😊😊❤
Hey Rick, in may I walked into the emerg and found out I had a severe mitral regurgitation and my lungs were filling with blood, so i got the side surgery and got my mitral valve repaired, i was in tje hospital for almost a month.  nice to hear we are not alone 🙂
Glad to hear the surgery went well. God bless!
Extremely happy that you are OK. Love your channel. Be well my friend.
I used to work at the Intercontinental attached to the clinic.  Glad you are doing well.  What did you think of the Rockhall?
Glad youre doing well Rick. I mainly watch the interviews as I dont have a huge interest in mysic theory. You are an excellent interviewer and I watch every one that you upload. Keep up the great work!
Glad to hear you are recovering Rick. Get totally well soon 👍🙏
IM REALLY HAPPY FOR YOUR QUICK RECOVERY!! YOU LOOK FANTASTIC RICK!! LOOKING FORWARD TO ALL YOUR AWESOME COMMENTARY AND AWESOME INTERVIEWS.  PLEASE STAY HEALTHY, YOUR AWESOME RICK!! KEEP ROCKIN IN THE FREE WORLD!! 😊💓🤘✌️
Great to hear you're in good health man! I'd love to see a What Makes This Song Great on Thin Lizzy. So many rock bands cite Thin Lizzy and Phil Lynott as huge inspirations so I'd love to see one of those videos.
❤😊
Glad to hear the surgery went well and you’re feeling great Rick! Can’t wait to see what the future brings for you and your channel! Stay well buddy! Keep up the great work!!!
health is like music, to move forward you need a slience, a breath and every breath take, every move you make we'll be watching you !
Rick, just do what makes you feel good and doesn’t hinder any of the healing that remains. It’s all good anyway.
Glad to see you doing good.
Rick, I am glad your recovery is going well. I retired in January and your channels are one of my happy activities. Take care of yourself and thanks for what you do.
I'm glad to see you're doing okay Rick..
May the Lord Jesus keep you in his arms and bless you, your family and friends!
Glad you feel great. 👍
Rick always enjoy your vids  Especially Steely Dan ones Please take care and stay well. ❤
Glad to know you’re doing better, Rick! ❤
I'm amazed that you're making a video one week after open heart surgery! Glad to hear and see that you're doing well. Go get 'em!
Be well. Love your interviews and love the fact that the interviewees appreciate that you really get what they are doing!
Onward and upward Rick. Keep on rockin’.
I didnt start learning theory until my mid 40s - im now in my mid 50s.  Your videos have been a fantastic inspiration.  Im thankful youre doing very well from your surgery!  Prayers and continued blessings to you and your family!  May you keep inspiring and helping others in everything you do - Thank you!
It is amazing what medical science can accomplish.  Best of health Rick! Here's is to many more years of educating and entertaining us.
No Les Pauls for you!
Hey Ricki,  don't cough.. 🌹🌹❤
Praying for a long and blessed musical life, Rick! 🙏
Glad it went well Rick!
Hey Rick, Congrats on your successful surgery from a fellow heart patient! With heart issues and aging in mind, I think it would be great for the channel to align your next interview victims by age and known health conditions. As cynical as that may sound, so many of the legends in music and related fields of production and technology are getting older, and their stories need to be archived sooner rather than later. I'm sure you were bummed at not getting to talk to Jeff Beck before we lost him. That would have been so cool. Anyway, now that you have a new lease on life/health, I wish you the energy to get all the great ones!
(I like a 50/50 Interviews/playing)
Glad your okay Sir. Be well.
More song breakdowns! Keep trucking!
So glad you're ok, Rick! Take care of yourself. ♥️
My brother had the exact same procedure
So glad you’re doing well. Love your channel!
Happy you're making a recovery. Look after yourself!
nothing above 10 pounds? Guess it's time to sell the les pauls Good to know youre in good hands, Rick, happy to have you on my feed for many more years. Cheers to your health
Glad to hear you are on the mend!
God bless you, Legend.
God bless you, Rick.
Happy to hear that all went well
Awesome! Glad you are doing well!
That was just amazing!!! You look terrific!! Continued good health.
So glad you are feeling well. Rock on!
Glad it was successful and you are feeling better again. We need you here, Rick!
Get well soon, Rick! Take care of yourself.
Sending lots of well wishes  amd prayers to you.🙏.
Rick, you are amazing! Best wishes for a speedy and successful recovery!!!
saúde mano rick !
i miei migliori auguri Rick🦾
Congratulations on the successful surgery. I hope recovery is quick and painless. I'd love to see another "Spotify top 10 rock" review. Especially right now as number 3 is "Sick" by The Warning.
Some of your interviews over the last year have just been great. From Yngwie to Joe B. to Warren H. and others that just had me glued to the screen. Steve V. and Joe S. just awesome for me thank you for your great work and glad you're healing nicely.
Hi Rick, glad to see you back. Hope for your quick recovery.
Glad you’re doing well Rick! I would love to see you do more dives into the top metal charts songs.  I always loved your analysis on those songs and you seemed to have more fun with them than the constant drab of the pop charts. There’s a lot of cool things happening in the more alternative styles of music and your professional analysis is really cool. Hope your recovery is swift and painless!
love the channel rick glad all went well
I really enjoy interviews, to get inside the mind of artists is very interesting and exciting to listen to. I hope you keep this going it is my personal fav. Ideas for guests if I may, Robby Krieger and John Densmore. I know they are both hard to get (maybe) but both are part of rock history and it would be magical to get inside their minds for awhile.  Cheers
Get well soon
Best Wishes of good healing  total recovery
How TF are you even posting a video within days from having heart surgery!?! Take a day off Rick 😂 take care and rest❤️🙏
Mr. Beato, my best wishes for full and speedy recovery!
So great to see this outcome.
Glad to see you recovering so well, Rick..take it easy my man❤🙏🎸
So happy that you are feeling good & recovering so well a week later! Your offering to educate & expose us to great music & musicians we would not otherwise know about with your unique knowledge set is truly inspiring. Absolutely love song breakdowns.😁 You're going to be unstoppable now!!💖💖
I'm glad you're okay! 💪 I really love your channel and you seem like a great guy. Thanks for the info. I am turning 59 and I don't really have any issues except severe arthritis from playing guitar and a rare stomach disorder which is intermittent. I did have angina once about 4 years ago and they basically told me just Have my heart checked every 3 years. So far so good but maybe at some point I may have to have something done Maybe a stent or something along those lines. My mom had a valve replacement so I kind of get the gist of what happened to you. Do everything you're supposed to and I'm sure you will be fine and will have many more good years. Thanks for the update Rick See you on the next video Peace 🙏😎
Hey Rick! I can appreciate and empathize with your journey. Good to hear you made it through. Take care!
Get well soon rick
Take care, Rick! Happy you're feeling well and everything went smoothly!
It’s really good to know your progress is good.  All the best!
The best for you Rick! From Mex
Glad to hear you're well...NO LES PAULS!! only dreadnaughts.
thumbnail: when you listen 1 Taylor Swift song
Rock on Rick!🎉🎸
Good to see you´re back, Rick! Wonderful!
Glad to hear you are doing well honestly
So glad you were on top of this and got it addressed.  Had an aortic valve and an aortic aneurysm fixed via a similar open heart procedure back in 2012 and luckily had a similar flawless outcome.
Great to see you're ok.
Best Wishes, Blessings, You Rock
Glad you're ok Rick!
Thank you for this post.   I have a similar condition and haven't thought about it for a while.  I have, too, been feeling pretty tired lately.   Time for a checkup for me.  Happy to hear it went well & you're in good shape afterwards. Thanks again.
Look after yourself Rick and get lots of rest 😊 💪🏾
Get well and stay healthy Rick!
It's odd that a hospital should look like a hotel resort. The American healthcare system is for the rich.
Keep well. Glad the procedure went well.
Good to see you came through everything so well. 🤘I would say "Get better soon", but that seems entirely redundant! 😁
Have a healthy life ahead Rick. You should bring more artists into your channel around the world. I loved your conversation world around like Mohini Dey etc.,
Really really glad you're ok, man  More song breakdowns! How about song breakdowns (using stems I mean) with guests? Either the artists themselves or with fans who wanna geek about their favourite songs?
Yeah, you have fans in Brazil... Take care, good music needs you more than ever. Thank God you really look healthy. Best regards.
Welcome to the Club Rick! Had mine at 54 …. 8 years ago! Take your time with your health. We can wait. :) Best to you and your family!
Beautiful to see you beeing well again. 😊 I wish all the best,  greetings and a whole lotta love from germany!👍
Glad you’re on the mend.
Sending you some brotherly love Rick.   I'm glad that all is well.   Todd
J sus..RockON!
You look good!!!😊
Stay well! I love your show!
I hope you had a chance to go the the Cleveland Museum of Art. It’s one of the best in the country. Best wishes on a continued recovery.
I am glad you have the money to pay for this. Most people don't.
Glad you seem to be recovering fine. Another youtuber Austin McConnell also just recently had surgery for a regurgitating heart valve. Small world.
OH Rick Glad u shared this story as it could help others :)  Text book surgery is always a good thing to hear. Hope you keep up with the scar care its critical to avoid infection. It is scary for sure ! Now dont be surprised if you have a bit of anxiety cause if you feel something your mind goes right to your heart. Good to see you :) you look great ! xo
It's that moment in life when we need to step back and have another look at some of our life choices, 2 years ago I also had heart surgery and made a full recovery. Gave up sugar and the booze, having a new grandson made a difference. Rick it's great to see you firing on all cylinders take care, Your following and subs are a testament to your ability to bring people together and smile from the heart.
I am so happy you are recovering well
God bless you buddy!
Great to see that Rick is up and about after his surgery.  Heart shit is really scary, and I’m relieved like everyone to see it has gone so well.  Does anyone know if a heart which isn’t working so well would show up in some way on blood tests?  Heart disease is everywhere on all sides in my family, and I was diagnosed with CFS/ME a few years ago.  Part of me worries that my fatigue is actually heart related - because it’s got nearly every other guy in the family - and I’ve just been given this umbrella diagnosis because they’ve not done the right tests.  My aims are simple and realistic, I want to see my daughter graduate university, which is a good way off yet.
Happy to se you Rick , take care of you, many people love your work but the most important is your heart so be careful of your health , i wish you the best for the future
I love the interviews, keep them coming and take care!
Welcome back Rick !! You look great !!
God bless you Rick
We like you! If you have the energy what do you think about listening to real old rock? And comment
Great to hear you doing better Rick. God bless
I had an aortic valve replacement 4 years ago for an on-x valve. Scary stuff at 50 but came through it and can walk for hours and go anywhere I want to go. All the best, great channel.
I call my slightly irregular heartbeat, the jazz drummer in my body.  I'm 61, so far, so good.  Speedy recovery!
Feel better and stronger, we need your lead to educate the music world...
I’m glad you are doing well. Please continue to do so.
Glad you're fine Rick. Good thing you were on top of things. Lookin' good man! Take care.
Glad you are feeling better Rick.   Continued prayers for you
Glad to see your back at it, Keep going.
Glad to hear it was successful, and that you are feeling strong. Be well.
Congrats on the surgery Rick!  Always love your updates!   Thank you for all you share with us, it brings joy to my day....  Would you be open to doing "What Makes This Album Great'?  And take your sweet time doing it...  maybe Moving Pictures?
Glad you are well Rick! I guess you can’t pick up  Les Paul for a while.. given the weight.
Thanks for sticking around Rick. Now get back to work. After PT that is.
I’m glad that you’re well, Rick. I’m not a musician, but I am an avid listener and your channel has made me better at listening which has added pleasure to my life. Thanks.
Please do #11 sounds for healing!!!! 😊💫
Thanks!
I vote more song break downs and what makes this song great.
Great news, Rick. Talking for me: it's not curiosity, it's affection. And for those who say you're a national treasure, here is an Italian living in Spain who loves your channel and contents, and respect you a lot – said with a smile. Music has no boundaries!
Looking great, Rick. So happy to see you looking well.
A new series, that's cool.  "What makes this Surgery great?"
Welcome to the zipper club! Would love a rig breakdown/ interview of Jimmy Page!
Rick, we love you. ❤💪🏼💪🏼🫶🏼👍🏼
Glad everything went well.  I like the interviews  and sing break downs. The theory is a distant third or 4th.
Rick had his pickup re-wound! Thank God you're OK Rick, thanks for the update.
Be well Rick, the world is a better place with you in it.
Holy cow, amazing you just had this a week ago, you look great!  Get well soon and keep the videos going!
You joined the zipper club. I had a triple bypass 8 years ago. Glad to hear that yours went well Rick!
Keep rockin' Rick.
Glad you’re ok - thanks for sharing.
ROCK ON RICK!   ....but no up and behind the head wild guitar solos for a while, ok?
Modern medicine and science is amazing.  Glad you are doing so well Rick! :)
welcome to the zipper club!!!! i got one too. 👍😊
VERY happy that your valve surgery was successful. I'm sure it was a bit unsettling to go through everything. Your positivity in your everyday life showed through I'm sure. Thank you for everything you do for us out here in the Interweb :)...
Rick - if possible do a video tour of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Your observations would be very interesting.
Good to see you up and about Rick, speedy recovery.
Glad you are feeling better!  I love your long interviews please keep them coming 😊
Glad the recovery is going well. My dad had that not long ago. It wasn’t easy.
Cleveland!  Still the Heart of Rock and Roll.
And yes you are a National Treasure!
Yeah Rick ! I had mitral valve repair April 16th didn’t quite go as nice as yours but yeh yeh to you ! Big fan !! I’m doing ok all the best to you !!
Rick I am so genuinely grateful that you have had such successful surgery. We need you in this world for so many more years to come. Your passion for not only music, but teaching, encouraging and bringing great artists to us is so greatly needed in this world.
"Can play the guitar"...🤣 as long as it's not a Les Paul... Woof, mine is a load. Have a great recovery Rick!
Good news! Wishing you the best of health!!
Glad you're well Rick! If I ever had to go through such procedure, I'd be definitely confident thanks to you. Cheers man!
Good luck. Thanks for what you do.
Glad you're doing O.K. Shawn R., Mo-Mutt Music/Sacred & Secular
My cardiologist orders, lift a Strandberg but not a Les Paul
Glad to know you are doing well after the surgery – wishing you good health in future. It got me thinking, though. Apparently, open heart surgery costs on average over $100,000 in the US. What's a typical co-pay on that? In 2024, it might be good to vote in the direction of healthcare for all before healthcare for profit...and eliminate this bizarre US phenomenon called medical bankruptcy.
A speedy recovery to you!❤
Glad surgery went well!
nice to see you back here. love your content .
Glad you pulled through, Rick! We're all grateful that we're going to have Rick for a long time! As far as thoughts about the channel direction, hey man, you're 62, you just had open heart surgery, do whatever the hell you want! I love your greatest or top 10 or 20  "   "  of all time videos where you play parts of songs. God bless you!
Mazel Tov! My back ground is Radiology and have seen the images before the surgery. Stay healthy. Keep your heart in your music
Rick, we appreciate the insight to your life. We are all thankful you got ahead of this. Keep on going, don't be afraid to try new topics or have new guests.
I pray that God blesses you to continue in your successful recovery.
So glad your recovery is going well......Stay Up, Hard, and Healthy brother.....🔥🔥🔥🫡❤️👍🏽💯
Come on Rick!!! So happy you are recovering well.
Hey buddy I am so happy you got all that behind you. I hope you completely recover in a very short time. This world needs a lot more Rick Beato. Every time I watch one of your videos you make my day. Thank you Rick! We all love what you do and we love you. Rock On!!!
So glad the surgery was a success Rick. Same age as me, I consider myself a young man still ; -). You've got at least a couple decades left on God's green earth. Love the channel, the interviews are always top notch, like two old friends having a chat about music.   All the best, take it easy for 6 weeks.
Wish you all the best ❤
Hi Rick, wishing you good health always.
Rick, I've been watching your channel for a few years and it's one of the most informative, interesting things I've come across. I'm glad to hear your surgery went smoothly. Keep up the good work!
So glad to hear it
Get well soon ❤
Can't Beat Beato 😎
Glad to know you recovered and you feel healthy! Sending Much Love!!
Good news Rick. Your channel is one of the best out there. Just wondering if you'll be doing any new interviews with fellow musicians and if you have considered trying to get Eric Clapton or Jimmy Page on? Clapton has done several interviews with The Real Music Observer. The channel however isn't nearly as popular as yours. Thanks from Portugal
I'm am so glade all went well! As a 62 year old guitar player and musician very glade to see you smiling ;-)
Thanks for the update! So happy for the good report. Blessings Rick!
G' Day young rick, welcome to the zipper club, there's a lot of us. Glad to see you looking so well, I particularly enjoy your break downs on  the top ten. nobody does it better my son. Great work.
Love you Rick! Sending you healing, love  and rock and roll vibes. You’re so loved and this world is better because you’re in it teaching and playing music.
Looking good Rick, glad to see you are bouncing back so quickly. 👍👍
Great news
Get some rest and take care Rick!
It’s a miracle what they can do these days !  We live in a fortunate time ! Thanks for the update , I gotta go lie down now !
Good going, Rick!
I'm glad that you're doing well, Rick!
Glad you’re okay. Cleveland Clinic is the best. My mentor, Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn is head of preventive cardiac, but formerly head of surgery
You bring joy to so many! Thanks!!!
Glad you're on the mend. Very happy for you and your family. Your channel is one of the best in the world and many of us would be heartbroken if you were no long able to do it. So glad you're not one of these people who ignore their health. 👍
Wow, you lost a lot of weight, Rick. You look great!
You're looking really good, man! Glad you're ok!
Auguri❤💪🤟🎸
Congratulations on your successful operation! I hope your recovery goes well   Regarding your request at the end of the video: I really enjoyed your recent "philosophical" videos, like  "The Real Reason Why Music Is Getting Worse", and the comparison between the Beatles and Taylor Swift; and would enjoy seeing more!
Still praying for you.
Great to see that you're recovering well Rick.
You look fine Rick.  And now enjoy every minute.  Have a wonderful day !!!
I'm very glad that you're doing better and that the surgery was successful. As for the direction of the channel, I've greatly enjoyed the interviews you've been doing (even though I'm also a fan of What Makes This Song Great series and hope that they continue to some degree). Your interviews with artist seem much more interesting than so many other interviews I see where the artist are asked a bunch of questions by someone that can't of doesn't fully appreciate their music. It is clear that you're interviewing your hereos and those that inspire you, so your questions go to the heart of who they are, how they think, and how they formulate their music.
Sending you prayers my brother...your still a young man....I just turned 68...and still playing...
Rick - first off, so happy to hear you are recovering nicely. I lost my brother this year (age 61), so it is not lost on me the fragility of our lives. I have enjoyed the interviews this year, some of which have been profound. There are so many artists I would love to hear you interview. You get to the essence of what they are about like no one else. I have equally enjoyed the song breakdowns. I love learning new things and you challenge me to embrace the need to do so. Keep up the great work, but most of all, take of yourself. Thanks.
Glad you're ok!!!
Love your show ☝️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Power and strength Rick....love from South Africa.
Best wishes to you Rick and speedy full recovery!  My mom has open heart around 16 years ago for a bypass and has been doing great ever since.  She was 58 at the time and now 74 and hasn't had any issues.
Good to see you doing well.
Wishing you a speedy recovery....
The heart of music repaired. Follow it's beat. Thanks for your fantastic content. Cheers Jan VdK from Belgium
You should do more greatest song from that band videos like you did with Alice in Chains or REM, etc.
Get well soon!!take a good rest!!!
Cheers, Rick! Glad to know surgery went well.
Thanks for everything, Rick!!
Great news, brother. You'll be in my prayers.
Rick must live at least 25 years more 🙏🏼
Recover quickly 🤘
Best wishes for a speedy recovery Rick   YouTube needs your channel!!
Great to hear Rick. Get better quick! We need you!
Your comments reminded me of Gustav Mahler,  who knowing that he would eventually die of his heart condition, continued to compose. Today you are blessed with modern medical care but nevertheless, your work ethic seems to come from the 20th century:-) May you live long and happy.
Love all the content. However WMTSG hooked me on the channel years ago. Would love to see more. I watched every single one.
Glad to hear you’re on the mend
❤
Heart related things couse me towering anxiety even hearing anyone talk about it. Glad it worked out
God bless you dear brother. Wishing and praying for a quick and permanent recovery. We need you around Rick. Even though we have not met, I consider you my guitar mentor. Your Arpeggios MC has opened my understanding in ways I couldn’t imagibne. You are loved and highly esteemed! 👍🙏😎🎸
Glad all went well, Rick!  Take it easy...no big rush.  Your health comes first, brother!!
All the best Rick! Keep at it!
Glad all went well, Rick!  You look great!

Rick glad you are OK. I have enjoyed your channel for years keep it up Buddy. God bless.
That’s great news , so glad your surgery went well , just keep on doing what you do ! Musicians all over the world love you !
My grandmother went through same heart valve issue, also at Cleveland Clinic. The phenomenal Cleveland Clinic! Best wishes for a full recovery, Rick! We love you and your outstanding work!
Love the channel Rick, love the recent interviews. Glad you’re recovering well.
❤‍🩹
Happy you are doing well. You look great. Re: direction of channel,  it's your channel, do what you enjoy. Those of us who are fans of Rick Beato will continue to watch.
Speedy recovery mate
Glad all is well rick god bless you
🙏☮🙏
Hope you're doing well!!!!!
Glad it was a success and that you're recovering really well.
Glad you’re doing well , I just had a heart monitor put on for fatigue and other heart issues I’m experiencing . Good to see a peek of positive news.
Glad it went well and you are recovering! Try not to listen to the Spotify top 10 for a while. That can’t be good for the heart.
Glad all turned out good, looking forward to your song analysis videos.
So glad to hear you're doing well. Thank you for all you give to us.
Rick, I pray for your continued recovery and wellness and wish you many more years of doing what you desire to do. Thanks for sharing your story with the folks.
So happy to see you looking so well!
So happy you're doing well after your major surgery! Old father time is a bummer. :)
Glad you are doing well Rick ❤
All the best Rick
Jim Page interview mate
Peace to you and your family.
Really happy your heart surgery well! Here’s to another 62 years around the sun for you!
sending good vibes  to Rick from liverpool
Glad to hear you're doing well.  I love the interviews you do,  but I do miss the " what makes this song great" series.  Just my 2 cents worth.
Thankfully, the surgery was successful, but we will all still keep you in our thoughts. Hope you heal quickly! We are all here for you!
Boy, those drains they put in are killers! couldn't breathe for quite a while! feel great now! been a year.
I'm glad you are healthy and happy Rick.  Beyond that, I'm glad you got some time here in Cleveland.  Fantastic art museum here in town.
*Rick!* I'm so glad you got thru surgery♪♫♪
He’s an international treasure! Be well Rick — so much affection for you.
Congratulations Rick!
Somebody said you're a national treasure, while me from India feeling you're an international treasure. I was at my lowest hopes in getting good film scoring guides on the internet, but you saved me Rick! I love each song analysis video, really helps my curiosity as I want to do the same as a hobbyist. Sending love and support from India!
Wishing you a full recovery. My best friend had similar surgery, got impatient with the "go easy" instructions, and almost died from fluid buildup in the pericardium. Please take it slow and steady!!
Very happy to hear you are recovering Rick. Here in the UK you would be what we call a "national treasure" . Protected for everyone to enjoy. Take time to recover. I've been there. 6 months before you are fully back in the game. Slow and careful...
Cleveland did my brother’s surgery years ago. Mitral valve, three bypasses and a liver transplant all in 8 hours. He did great. It’s the best place for heart surgery. Get well soon!
Good recup man! Get well!! Cheers!
All the best, Rick. Glad to hear that. Big thanks for the doctors, good job, awesome! Zdrowia!
Would love to see more song breakdowns. That's the reason I started watching in the first place. I find those videos so interesting. Glad you're feeling better!
You're not allowed to leave us.  You're all we have keeping the ability to play an instrument alive.
Wonderful to see you are recovering 😊
Nothing over 10lbs huh? Can’t play those Les Pauls then.   You look good. Take care of yourself.
Good to know you are good. God bless you.
Glad to hear you are having a successful recovery, Rick!
Had open heart in 2018 - not a picnic. Had the same valve replaced 4 weeks ago. A TAVI procedure. No open heart. Feel like a millions bucks. Best wishes to you Rick. I’m sure you’ll feel much better in no time. 🇨🇦🇺🇸.
Rick, whatever you do, don't look at what the  itemized hospital bill would have been had you not had insurance. We need you safe and sound!!
I love this!!!  Good on you for sharing an important story.  You are loved and revered.  😉
Wouldn’t be learning guitar at 49 years old without you Rick! Such an inspiration. Love the interviews with people who create iconic music. I don’t understand the breakdowns as much because I am still learning but all the content is great! Keep it up.
Hang in there Rick! Great to hear you are on the mend! You are already looking much better,  carry on!
Hi Rick, glad you're doing well!   I really appreciate your channel, it gives a professional perspective that's not commonplace.  At least on YouTube.   Myself, I like a good mix that's a balance of in depth song breakdowns and analysis, separated by some humor, "survey" style videos, (worst/best songs of an era), and interviews.  Particularly your interviews!   Insightful and delightful!     Thank you much,
Really glad you are doing ok!   Thank you for the update.
God’s speed, Rick!  So glad to hear you’re recovering well!  Love your channel, and your insights and perceptions about music.
Hope you get well soon bro, Luv & Thx u so much for yr content : )
Hey Rick, you made the right choice. Good recovery! Greetings from a German cardiologist. Keep up!
Mucho ánimo maestro!!!!!! Recuerdos desde España!!!!! Le seguimos con cariño, buena recuperación y a cuidarse!!!!!!!!! Kind regards from Spain!!!!!!❤
Rick please keep doing the interview’ s and what ever it takes please with Jimmy Page.
Wow! Hope you are very well Rick! Much love!
Can't lift 10 lbs......watch it with those Les Pauls!
"The kids don't know but us oldsters understand." (Sung to Back Door Man by Willie Dixon.) Glad you did so well, Rick.
I'm glad you're okay. If you want to know what I like about the channel, mostly the interviews, then the song breakdowns.  You are a really perceptive interviewer, and since you're a musician yourself, you ask questions that, say, a newsman might not.  One subject I'd like to see a video about is the crash of radio.  I understand that radio plays are a big source of income, and so radio plays declining, there's not so much money for the artists.  Can you elucidate?
So happy you are recovering well.  Thankful also for the talent at the Cleveland Clinic.
Well that is a big relief. Glad you are feeling better. You are a miracle! Praise be for surgeons!!!
Metronome repair, CHECK! Happy to hear you're back in rhythm Rick. Best to you on your recovery.
❤ Thank you Thank you Thank you for always keeping things REAL! Love your videos and content.
Sorry to hear you're going through this but thankfully it looks like you're doing good now.  I lost my mom May 30th almost 1 year after she had open-heart surgery to replace the same valve.  It's a rough and stressful thing to go through so I hope you're taking your time and don't fret about the channel because stress can really impact healing.  Spend your time with your family and relax a while.  Cheers!
You survived, so I am thankful for that.
God Has blessed you with more days to entertain us! Yay
Great to ear... Thanks from France
Nice to see you well. Greettings from Azores, Portugal
Great to see you looking so well, Mr Beato.
Wow Rick, how scary! Glad that you're doing well!
I am so glad to hear you are recovering from the surgery.   I hope you are good for another 100,000 miles. :)
Good to hear your surgery went well, Rick!  I miss the song breakdown videos, personally.  I love all the interviews though, so if they keep coming, I won't be disappointed.  Best of luck in your health!
Here's to a quick recovery, Rick!
So glad you're back!! - More interviews 🙏
You are a good patient ,great shape and thin.glad there were no complications.
Take care of yourself, you have more energy than most people. We all love you and your work, take care.♥
So happy the surgery went well, Rick! Idea for a segment:  Review your favourite songs with HEART ❤in the title, and why you LOVE them. Stay well. Be happy. Keep creating and teaching.
Glad your doing good! Mabey do some collaboration with other music youtubers like Josh Tuner, Sophie Lloyd, Gabriella Quevedo just to name a few.
glad it went well, hope you a speedy recovery!
Rick, I'm glad you're doing well.  Whatever direction you decide to go in I know I will find it interesting and entertaining.
Be well Mr B, love your channel ❤
Looking good Rick, rest well.
The zipper club. That's what you are now a member of Rick. You'll be good for another 60 years.
You look like recovery is going well. 🙏  for a full recovery! Much respect.
Very happy that your op was a success and that your feeling better
Some suggested music during your recovery Rick.  - Don't Go Breaking My Heart -  Total Eclipse of the Heart -  Me And My Broken Heart - My Head & My Heart - Tear in My Heart - My Heart Will Go On - Love Theme from "Titanic" - Owner of a Lonely Heart -  Even If It Breaks Your Heart  ..............................................   🙂😂🤣   Glad you're OK buddy.
Be sure to listen to the B-sides while you heal Rick!
Glad you're doing well, Rick! Cleveland Clinic 29 years in a row voted best cardiology in the nation. Like you said, Dr. Gillinov is probably the best in the world.
Pronta y total recuperación. Dios lo cuide Sr. Beato.
I love you my man, God bless you🙏.
It was the trap beats.
Yeah Cleveland Clinic!  I had a major surgery there.  Smooth sailing, 4 days in the hospital, bounced right back.  Cancer-free and better than ever!  I'm also 62 by the way.  Keep on rocking in the free world!
Great news
Fantastic news  great to hear.  It's hard as heck when you have been pretty blessed with good health,  but as we get older  these things need to be looked at and  addressed ...especially hard for men.   Good on you Rick! ❤❤  Stay away from that 10# Les Paul for a cpl weeks...
G;ad you're OK now Rick!
Great to see you looking so well Rick!!!Take your time coming back, don’t what to over do it!!!😊 see you soon!!!!👏👏👏👏👏
Love you man  👍🏼

All the best Rick! it's just amazing what modern medicine is able to do. Imagine living just 50 years ago let alone 500 years ago...
Glad you're ok.  Thought you might have used auto tune by accident and had an allergic reaction.
Glad everything went well and you’re on the mend, Rick! Love your channel, and would love to hear more song breakdowns. Specifically would love to hear you talk about earlier Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers and the drum sound on Damn The Torpedoes. But love whatever you choose to do with the channel!
Hermano mio, my one wish for you, is that all your other wishes come true.
glad you're doing well and good to have you back. More "what makes this song great" vids
So glad your doing well!!! We're all getting a little older, Time to get wiser and go in for check ups!!! Gotta keep up on things!!! Just remember..."Our life together... Is so Precious together"........Lennon
♥️♥️♥️
Get well so soon!!!!!
Glad you are well Rick 👍
Take care, Rick! Longtime fan of yours

Nice
Glad everything was a success Rick!
god bless stay healthy dont lift anything 10 lbs so no les pauls
Cant lift anything over 10lbs, so leave the les pauls alone for 5 weeks.
Anything you do Rick is great content. We are doubly blessed for you creativity and excellence! I would love to see you talk and Jam with another of my YouTube hero's Eric Weinstein, as a casual fun hang and see what you two get up to. Cheers and God bless!
So glad my fellow Italian musical guru is doing great after surgery!!! We need you around Rick to keep us motivated and educated. All the best to you 🎸🙏👍😎🇮🇹❤️‍🩹
I'm so glad to see that your surgery went well. A family member had aortic valve replacement in April - amazing what they can do now, just swapping out a part. Be well. xx
Interesting. Youtuber AustinMcConnell also had the same done to him a few days ago. Same diagnosis and all. What are the odds?
Glad your healthy Please stay that way Some ollllld song breakdowns would be great Like les Paul Motown  60"s rock etc
I don’t think you can do any better than Gillinov and the Cleveland Clinic.
Awesome news, Rick, thanks for sharing your experience!
We are grateful for the good outcome Rick.  You're a national treasure.  So glad that you are getting great care and will be around for A LONG TIME.
Great news, Rick.
Glad to hear this, Rick.
Write a song about it !
Brilliant, its great to have you back!
Thank you for the update, Rick, glad to hear you are doing well.
🎉 Beato > Beat0
Looking well👍
Love you Rick!  Please talk about Johnny Marr at some point.
Glad your surgery was successful, Rick! Heal up and feel better!
Wow! Glad your surgery and recuperation is going well. Keep these interviews and commentaries coming!👍🏻
Wishing you lot's of health and long life G-d willing! good to have you back! 🍁
I have a mitral valve prolapse and have known about it since I was a teen - I'm 66 now.  The good news is that it hasn't changed one bit.  Best to you Rick.
Glad you are feeling better!!! Heavy duty man! We are glad you are planning on being around here for quite a while. Thank you for the guitar lessons. At 59, I am learning a lot more from you, Professor. Your knowledge and love of music, and of life, are contagious, and both are great gifts that you share with all of us! Thank you, and welcome back!
🫵🏻👏👏👏👏👍
Glad you are doing well!!  But thinking about this makes me so squeamish!
I'm glad you're recovering well, hugs from Brasil
Good luck Rick, wishing YOU a speedy recovery!  And remember, your heart-monitor is NOT a beat machine. Do NOT adjust the tempo!  😬😬😬
Glad that it went as well as it could be expected!
Hope you recover fully Rick
Great to see you're doing right now!
Wishing u a fast and easy recovery. Keep on truckin'!
Glad you’re ok!
My dad had the same surgery 25 years ago when he was around your age. Made a full recovery. He said it felt weird to sleep on his stomach from then on though.
Good to see you got it fixed. That’s what killed my wife
cant lift 10lbs.. stay away from those 80's Les Pauls mate. Glad you are out an about. Keep Well Rick
Dude...Glad you're tuned up!
You may pick a guitar but not a bass guitar you've bought (sorry for a pun). Speedy recovery!
Glad you’re doing well. ❤
He's back!
I’m happy that you’re healthy now!!
Hearing you're doing well, is music to everyone's ears.
Glad you're feeling better!!
All the best mate - love from Liverpool 💗
Great news Scarchest! Look forward to more music !!!
Greetings  from Çanakkale, Turkey
Very pleased to hear of your positive outcome please keep those fantastic interviews coming please.
Glad to hear you're doing well, Rick. I love your educational videos and compositions, so please keep some of those in the mix. I would love to hear you expand your discussions and interviews into other areas of music further outside of the big hits and the rock/pop/jazz arena. You've ranted about the state of music, but I would love to see you make some videos about and including people from outside of the mainstream, which I agree is pretty stunted, but there are entire communities of people across the country and around the world that are curating, creating and truly living and breathing music, and experiencing it it completely new ways, which are *different* but just as valid. All you have to do is put some feelers out there and let them know you're interested in who they are and what they are doing and I guarantee you will be surprised. I know you have covered some like Tosin Abasi and Tim Henson, but I truly believe we are in a time of revolution just as significant as the arrival of the Beatles in the 60's - we just don't know it yet.
Thank you, Mr. Beato.
you have such a positive spirit!  your shows got me thru my heart attack recovery 5 years ago! I have made a full recovery! And so will you!!! your youthful spirit will carry you thru many years to come! I am a 64 yr. old guy from NJ originally. when i watch your videos, it reminds me of the music discussions i had with friends years ago! You are timeless!! Rock on Rick!!! cheers Tom
I'm truly happy for you and your entire family!  I am praying you can continue to build your great legacy Rick!  Thank you for everything you do!
Thank-you Rick  - glad to see you are back in the saddle.
Greetings from the UK. The interviews are awesome but would love to see more song breakdowns. So glad you are home and. well
holy s.... what a shock watching that picture...I hope you get well soon. Huge fan. thanks.
Blessings Rick! Congratulations on the successful procedure.
So glad that you’re doing well. Take care. 🤟
You are so important !!
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Glad you are okay...  take good care and listen to your body!
Have a stupenduos recovery Rick!! We love you!! Looking forward to have you here forever and ever!!
Hey Rick I'm so glad you're doing better! I do miss the what makes this song great series, I remember a few years ago watching the More Than a Feeling episode and even though I've listened to that song thousands of times in my life, you pointed out things that I'd never heard clearly before and I wept in amazement. Brad Delp lived in my neighborhood in NH and was good friends with my high school science teacher so it was really powerful to hear an underheard harmony
Glad to hear you’re all patched up.  Can’t wait until the old man starts yelling at clouds again!
It’s great to hear that you are doing so well only a few days after  heart surgery! Thank you so much for this update, all the best wishes to you and take care!!!!
Praying for a complete and speedy recovery, Rick. 🙏
Even mix of interviews and song breakdowns IMO. Glad you're doing good, Rick!
Heal Up!  Great to have you around for another 62 years!
keep rockin
KEEP SHREDDING RICK, MUCH LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Welcome to the club!  Congratulations on a successful surgery.
Get well mate, I enjoy your videos, don't leave us now.
So very glad you’re mending up!  Love and enjoy your work. You’re a treasure! Take good care of yourself!🎶
I am just wondering about those dislikes, "what's your problem?" Does he owe you money since years or something? 😂
You are a inspiration Rick. Talking with so much confidence and energy after heart surgery. Takecare of your health and have good rest .
hi from Italy... glad to see you
Congratulations and praise God! Continued success with your music. I learn so much.
What a blessing!!! Great news Rick!!!
Rick, quick recovery! Love WhatsApp you do.
Happy to see you here again !!!... God bless you, Mr. Beato !!!... :D
So glad to have you back and with such a quick recovery.  we need you!
Glad to hear you are feeling better and things all went as planned!
Had my mitral and aortic valves done last August. Welcome ro the club. Rest up!
Given your weightlifting restrictions, if you want to play a Les Paul, you'd better get someone else to put it in your lap! Hope your recovery is 100%, Rick.
Glad things went so well and that you are recovering well.  Cleveland Clinic does earn its reputation.
Glad ur back in the saddle, Rick!!
Hi RIck, Good to hear you're looking after yourself. You have a good heart (in every way) and I'm glad you're well on the mend. 62 is a great age!♥
Glad you’re well! I have the same condition, also will need it repaired at some point. I enjoy your musical critiques of new music the most!
Thank you, Rick. If I could only follow one channel, it would be yours. Love from Denmark🇩🇰
Be well.
So glad you're good to go. God bless.
Say no to vaccines
Glad you're feeling better.
Glad to hear you're feeling better! God bless :)
1. So glad you are doing well. what a blessings such things are able to be handled so well. 2. Absolutely love the artist interviews that you have been posting. 3. But miss the song breakdowns and 'what makes this song great'. Not sure how you'd have time to do more of those + continue with the number of artist interviews, but I'd love to see more of both. 4. Thx. this is by far my most watched channel on YT in addition to RB2 and Ward Carroll.
Stay well!
I´m glad you are back. Wish a full recovery (which seems on the way!) Keep inspiring us without limits!
Good to see you back home, looking good!!
just don't sneeze..
Glad to hear you are on the mend !  Great News.
Glad to see you're doing well. Conceptually crazy surgery. Thanks for the update.
I had my tricuspid valve repaired.
Do what ever you wish, it’s quality anyway! 🔥 Happy recovery! ❤️
INXS
You recovery is amazing! I went thru the same proceedure in 2015. Sore sternum for a while
I like the interviews
Glad you are on the mend
Very glad you're OK.
Stsy well Rick ✌️✌️✌️
Wonderful to hear you are feeling better on the other side of that. I have heart issues as well so I understand. Love and Light!
God bless you Rick❤
Good to hear everything is ok. Keep it going!!!!
Great news, Rick!  Cent 'Anni !!! 🙏
Having the blood flow correctly should make you feel exponentially better. Glad it was a complete success. Love to see and hear you regardless of the reason. Take it easy and bring us some "heartfelt videos" in the near future!
No playing 70s Les Pauls
Interviews and song break downs for me!
Speedy recovery and glad you’re doing well Rick. I would love to see you interview Johnny Marr this year.
❤
I am glad you are doing well and hoping your recover completely and quickly.  It is funny that in the last few weeks, I have discovered several of my friends also watch many of your videos.  I had no idea.
Дай бог здоровья
Glad you're doing well. I had a heart attack last December (widow maker) emergency surgery saved my life. The scary part for me was the fear of not being there for my wife and children. Everyday is a blessing, I'm thankful for each and every one yep even the not so good ones 🙏❤️
Take care of you Mister
Glad you are recovering well Rick.
So glad you are doing well! ❤
Flippin' eck, mate - that's a bit rough.... Best of luck with it all....
One of the only good things about living in Cleveland are some of the hospitals and doctors in the area.  Glad they got you all fixed up.
Glad it all went well! Looking forward to some "what makes this song great" videos. Cheers! 🤘🙂👍
Stay away from the heavy Les Paul and stick to the Strats. Ha! Glad your doing well!!
Best place in the world for heart work. Good luck to you!
But??? Please - get well!!! 💙💙💙
We pray for your health Rick, you mean a lot to many people. Many who you know well, many you have never met at all. You give so many people a little joy in their days & nights in a world full of politics & division showing the better elements of humanity. The world needs more people like you.
From one cardiology patient to another, so glad you’re doing well….love the channels!
Glad you’re ok mate. I’m loving the interviews please keep them coming however PLEASE try and get McCartney, he must be your grail!!!
So glad you're doing well Rick. Let your heart be your guide and  just continue doing what you love to do. Music.
Good thing most guitars aren't more than ten pounds. Glad to hear it went well and you're alright.
So glad it work out so well!
Hang in there, Rick! Lots of love and an avalanche of positive vibes to you.
I am glad you feel okay and things went well!  Every time I had something Invasive (even dental work), things went not okay. So I have a High Alert for Medical! 😂 Like the scar? You cannot put the Surgery in Reverse. What is done is done.  As for Channel? I prefer music breakdowns and personal stories. Not so much Interviews. Advice is simple! Do what YOU Love Best!
GOOD !!
Recovery soon! Long live Rick Beato!
Many wishes of best health from Poland, sir.
I’m glad you’re doing better!
Hey Rick. Glad everything went well. One of my friends goes to the Clevelend Clinic. Top notch facility with first class staff. I appreciate all your work. Keep them coming.
So glad you're doing well.  My friend (60) had the exact same operation. With equal results.  Stay healthy.
So glad you are doing better Rick!  Keep healing!
It´s great to know everything went perfect with your surgery Rick! Now  that you had "flushed all the valves" you´ll be as good as new in no time heheh! Have a perfect recovery and thanks for all your beautiful work!!🎸🎸
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick! Love your videos 🙏
We all wish you a complete and speedy recovery, Rick! All the best and may God bless you for all that you’ve done and continue doing for your viewers all around the world!  🙏🌹
Keep on, keeping on, I really enjoy your channel. Swift recovery  .
Good to see you're on the mend, just stay away from those 70's Les Pauls and Banjo's...Take it easy :)
Glad to hear the surgery was successful. Stay healthy.
Keep on strong Master Rick !!! You mean a lot for so many people including me ! Even though we don’t know each other in person … regards
Glad your surgery went well and your well on your way to recovering  Best wishes !!
Glad to have you still with us, Rick. Have a speedy and full recovery. God bless you.
God bless you 🙏🏻
Have a speedy recovery… you are much beloved by so many,
No lifting Les Paul’s for awhile. Take care Rick !!!!
Wishing you the best of health Rick 🤘
All the best! Sounds great what you tell. It’s terrific what they can do today. There are similar stories like that in my closest orbit, so I can relate to that and again wish you the best.
Great news, Rick!
happy to see you healthy and well❤
Just saw this and I am so happy that your surgery was a success. It’s remarkable what medical science can do and how we take it for granted. My brother had the surgery on his heart at UCLA, but this was 30+years ago. He has been fine ever since, and I hope the same for you. Your show is absolutely the finest music learning/appreciation channel and I’m sure all of the “Beato community” is grateful for all that you do. Cheers mate!!!
nothing but the best Rick!!
Glad to hear you're on the mend Rick.
I absolutely love the interviews and the "What makes this song great" episodes.
So glad you're doing well. My mom dealt with Mitral valve and A-Fib, she got a thing called the watchman and a pacemaker, shes doing good. Hope you continue to heal and get back to 100% 🫶 here's to another 62 years! 🍻
Glad you're feeling better! Love the channel!
Rick, so happy you are okay. I really enjoy your interviews. the depth of your understanding is very obvious in the interviews and in my view is a key reason people open up to you. Please stay well and keep up the good work. All the best, Jay
Rick,  I had quintuple bypass 13 years ago so I have a matching scar.  I 'm glad to hear that you are doing well.  I blame the AI music..its unnatural.
I'm glad everything went well, Rick. Take care of yourself, we need ya <3
Glad you’re better.
Glad you're feeling better, modern medicine is amazing.
Glad to see you back and very well after what must have been rough...
Nice.  Take it easy Rick.
So glad to hear you’re doing well!  Isn’t the progress in medicine wonderful?  Every so often someone will say “Don’t you wish you could go back to the good old days?”   I’ll say no, because modern medicine has saved my life so many times that I’d be dead several times without it.  I wouldn’t have made it out of childhood.
Glad that you’re recovering. Now, DO WHAT YOU’RE TOLD RE NOT LIFTING HEAVY THINGS, ETC.! 🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Glad you're OK, Rick. I really like to see more videos where you deconstruct things from the music industry, similar to the Ted Gioia interviews. The "insider" point of view can be very helpful for all artists.
Sending good vibes To you man🤘🏼🤝🏼🙂
Technology in the medical field is amazing.
I hope you are doing well, Rick!
Best wishes for a speedy recovery!
Best wishes
Congratulations on a successful intervention!   The stuff they can do these days boggles the mind.    As far as the channel goes - Everything you do is well presented, interesting and informative.  You were made for this stuff!   I'd like to see some occasional evaluations of music from around the world... An example might be Vreemde Kostgangers collaboration with George Kooymans of Golden Earring fame.   Some really interesting stuff out there!    Stay healthy Rick!!  Cheers!
So glad to hear of your successful surgery AND recovery!!! Make the best of the new years it gives you!! Glad to see you again....keep being healthy and looking forward to seeing more of you on YT for the coming years!! CC
Gen X > all😊
Glad the surgery went well and you are recovering well. I am down for whatever content you do. The what makes this song great are always good. The interviews are wonderful. The break downs of songs are good as well. I am just glad you are doing well and now you will be better. I am 62 and have heart stents. I have had them for a while.
Love ya Rick! Must feel great to take care of that nagging worry.
Ha...you're out and your back....maybe..loool...but great you got through it and you're ready to go.
Wow!! So happy it was successful and you are healthy and in good recovery!!❤️‍🩹 🙏👍 You are so helpful and beneficial to all of us who come to listen and view your wonderful, educational and inspiring channel!!   Sincerely 🇺🇸❤️😎
Glad you're ok Rick. I did the same (mitral valve reconstruction) surgery last year, then 1 month of rehabilitation. Feel good now. It's a sneaky disease. Cardiologist don't know when to act on it. It seams that they did a surgery little too late. My heart muscle has swollen little bit, and left atrium got larger, so I developed heart arithmia. You are a lucky guy. Enjoy your life and thank you for everything Rick. Stay healthy. 🙂 Maybe make video series about  plugins you love.
Your Heart is now stronger. Take care of your health with natural and UNPROCESSED foods. Good luck Rick!!! Go ahead!!!!  ￼
Thank God man.  Reboot 2024.  We need you. Looking forward to more content and great analysis.  Take care pal.
God bless you and hope you´re recovering well Rick Botticelli here!!
Hi Rick - it's good for people who are faced with surgery of any kind to hear about what to expect from others who have been through it. Thanks for posting your wonderfully positive story, and here's to your speedy recovery.🙂
I hope you have insurance.  you have out lasted many other pro Musicians at this point - so every day above ground, is a good day !
God love ya' Rick!!!!
Glad to see you doing better again Rick ! Health above all! ❤👊🏼
You are the best, Rick.
Looking good, Rick. Would never know you had any surgery at all. Continued good health to you!
Rick, if you apply vitamin E oil to your scar, it will fade with time IF you care about that. Either way we’re all glad you are well.
💪❤
Glad to hear you’re doing well, Rick!
Wishing you all the best, may you have many years ahead of you still! 🙌
Congratulations Rick ❤! And more song breakdowns!
Glad to hear you’re doing well! Personally, I’d love to see more of “WMTSG” but I understand those take a lot of effort and you might not want that anymore.
Better than being dead
Im glad you are recovering well, Rick. You are the best!
I had similar experience, changes your perspective ..Glad you are doing well.
God bless dude Beato. Healing energy to you, my friend.
Congrats on the miracle...modern science. You are one of the very best interviewers. Top three for sure. Haha.....keep working.
very good news, please do what you do, thx
❤ all the best, you're a treasure
Wow, thank goodness you are still with us and are healthy Rick! You are our life line for good music and other things.
Glad your doing well. I love your channel.
Stay well. We all appreciate you out here but stay well for your loved ones. Keep it saucy.
❤ Glad you are OK now... New you 🎉
I'm glad you did and are so positive about the experience.   I really love the song breakdowns ("'What makes this song great" e.g.) and I also love it when you talk about the music you love. I'm always looking for new ideas for music to listen to. You and Steve Guttenburg provide some interesting artists to check out.  God bless you Rick!
Keep that amazing talent of yours alive and growing better🙏. Your approach to the channel is like a really good song--there's different parts and different directions, and you bring it all together by the end of each video.
You're amazing! Keep doing what you're doing. Love the interviews and whatever you have to share!!
Hope you can score a McCartney interview! That would be the greatest ever
So very thankful your surgery was a complete success. Keep on keeping on Mr. Beato!
Thanks for the update.
Hope you're as healthy as you look. All the best in your recovery.
Best wishes for a speedy recovery Rick!
Glad you're back!

Here's to a speedy recovery, Rick. Greetings from Scotland!
Glad you’re on the mend, Rick!
You look wonderful!!  So glad.  I just posted your news on my FB page.  I like your interviews more than song breakdowns, since you asked.  Keep on keepin' on!  We need you and love you.
Glad it all went well. Good to see you up and about.
Glad you're feeling better Rick, keep on rockin and doing what you do.  We all appreciate you so much.
Glad you are recovering well Rick. I had a triple bypass back in 2007 and I've never looked back. Here's to many more years of your youtube channels.
DONT'T SNEEZE!!! Wishing you a quick and healthy recovery.
Great news! Thanks for the update as well. Wishing you rest and a full recovery ❗🧡🎶🎸
I feel you Rick! I had to have a double by pass at 58. My "Widow Maker" was 95% blocked.
Glad the surgery was a success. Wishing you many, many more years.
Godspeed, Rick!
Take care Rick. You have important work to do! 👊
Your bionic now, better than ever.  Take care. All the best.

So happy for you Rick♥
Glad you're doing well dude.
Man, as a fellow cardiac patient, I'm glad to hear that you are recovering well! Take care of yourself because you are, in fact, a national treasure. Love what you're doing!
Congrats Rick… isn’t modern medicine amazing!
My five year old daughter had her mitral valve replaced two months ago. She had a rocky hospitalization and we're battling a bunch of other issues,  but heart wise is looking amazing now. Glad you're doing well and hope for a speedy recovery.
Glad you're doing well!
Glad to hear you are mending. Keep on keeping on!
Glad everything's ok!  BTW, DON'T COUGH!
You sound different Rick. Good to see you well
Get well soon, I really enjoy your content!
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick!. Suggestion for your channel. What a music tech ( not just DAW breakdown) But key tools used in real songs. How it's done, what can we all learn and understand more about music design and music engineering and production.
Congratulations for such a successful outcome!
Glad you’re ok! 👍
Get well Rick we love you out here
Wow. I missed this. Glad to hear it went well.
Good to see you back and getting back to full health. We love you man! ❤❤
Just don't cough. 🙂 Have a speedy and thorough recovery.
Good man !
Wish you all the best Rick! The world is a better place with you on it…
Stay well, Rick. Love what you do.
Well done big fella. Best wishes for the future.
I agree with everyone else and just glad you are doing better
I'm so glad it was  successful
So glad to hear things went well! Stay healthy.
Found this guy during Covid -his positivity was very helpful then and still is now … so happy for his status as the one guy the heavy weight musicians want to be interviewed by
Whatever you do, get better, allow yourself to enjoy life and keep at it.. what you do is great.. recover well keep the passion.. love from a couple of Brit’s in Italy Tim and Joyce ❤❤ xx
Speedy recovery sir!  ❤
HUZZAH!!!
Glad to see that you are doing so well. I love your videos,  and hope you continue to make them. I love when you interview singer/songwriters, so maybe some more of those videos? Thank you
Thank god you are still kickin' it!!! High health to you Rick!!!
I'm so glad you are on the mend.  Nothing but good thoughts to you and your family!
Dang buddy! Respect and  much love coming your way ❤
So glad you're doing well. Take your time to recover. You're our guitar hero and we need you on here!
Glad to know you are better!
🎉🎉🎉God bless you!!!
For me the song breakdowns are the Crown Jewels of your channel. These were what brought me to you in the first place. Keep on keeping on & all the best to you & yours. Many thanks.
So… Rick was on a bed and they wheeled him into surgery. I think that counts as a Rick roll
It's so wonderful that you are well.
I am So Glad You Are Back Rick!
Wishing you well from the UK Rick, thoughts to you and your family.
Glad you are back!

Good on you, Rick! I'm happy your procedure went well and was successful. Do what the docs tell you! Good karma, eh?
Love your channel feel better soon.🙏🏻
So glad to hear you’re doing better.  Cheers!
"What makes this video great?" Rick is back and feeling good!

Thanks for the update. So happy to hear how well you are doing. Your channel is the best!
Love you and your channel Rick. So happy you're doing so well as I will be looking at the same surgery in the future. Unfortunately, Cleveland wouldn't be in the cards for me.    Take your time coming back ..don't rush the recover!
God bless you Rick.!!
So glad to hear your surgery was successful and you feel so good!  Praying for your continued recovery!
Great news Rick! I'll be praying for your continued healing and recovery. My Dad had a cow valve put in and he was like a new man. Love your work and your channel.
cool
Glad you are doing well!
So glad everything went well.💪🏻
Glad you are healthy Rick.
Hey Rick so glad your surgery was successful ,you have been through a very traumatic time ,I have watched your channel since times of COVID ,I have found your channel inspiring ,informative ,educational and all round just a pleasure to watch you do a great job RIck may you have many happy years ahead of you ,all the best from an old Shakin Pyramid .
So glad everything turned out well.
Good to see you up snd about... Good luck with recuperating
Deepest Love, Hugs & Blessings
Glad you are feeling better Rick.  Take it easy for a few weeks, its really important.  You may feel decent, but your body is still working hard to recovery from a traumatic injury (which is what surgery is).
Glad you’re ok stay healthy 🙂
🙏🏻
Glad you are feeling better, you interviewed some great studio musicians and this was really informative.
🙏
Hope you have a speedy recovery.
I was walking for exercise this morning in my house, I had some music on like I always do. The Moody Blues song, Nights in White Satin came on. They post the year it was recorded, and it was 1967. I had a reality check strike at that time. I was amazed at, after all these years not really paying attention to when it came on the scene, how timeless this song is. It sounds as fresh as it did when they recorded it. This piece will last forever. Being 64 I have heard this piece for most of my life, yet I’m still blown away at how great this song is. Have you ever done a what makes this song great in this one? Might be a good choice if you haven’t. I am so glad your surgery came out great, so rest and heal up. Looking forward to more content in the future. 😊
And the Beato goes on!  I'm glad you're recovering well, Rick. 🎉
You’re looking great Rick…hope the recovery continues to go well 👍👍🤘🤘
Hope you keep feeling better, :)
Glad to hear all went well, Rick!
I am happy for you! The technology in medical treatment is amazing today! I had a heart surgery last year after a heart attack. They did a great job and I am fine again and very grateful! Greetings from Germany! Ben C.
Nothing heavier than 10 pounds? Well, hands off the bass guitars.
Wow, so glad you are doing well. Rock on Rick
Great to hear that you are doing well Rick! You're right on about it being a "profound moment" having someone stop your heart is no joke. But its just as profound to think how far medical science has come! Take time to heal. We will all be here when ur ready! Be blessed!
So glad it went well and you're recovering! I am in my early 30's and have this same condition. I know it'll need to be replaced one day so it was incredibly helpful to hear from you that it's manageable and the minor sign you noticed that prompted the surgery. Speedy recovery and bet you'll pass the time well with a guitar in hand!
glad your are feeling better. I'm just lucky I've always been a runner, never been a smoker - so my docs tell me for an old fart (a bit older than you!) I'm in great shape (fingers crossed!)
I thought Cleveland felt like it was rocking extra hard.  I'm glad you're doing better.  Maybe come back to Cleveland for a live show ;).
Get well soon, you are the greatest talent.
You. Look. Marvelous!!!  You're in my thoughts and prayers Rick.❤🙏 As 4 the channel, just keep doing what u do!!!
Scars are badass :) Glad to hear you're feeling good!
Wish you a speedy recovery!
Glad to hear that everything went well Rick 👍
Take it easy with the posting and recording and whatnot. You should be resting. :) God bless you, man. I'm glad everything went smoothly.
Glad it went well! Its impressive what they can do!!!
I came to this channel, as many people have, for the song breakdowns and top 10s. However, I remain a subscriber because of the general appreciation for music that you have and convey to us. Whatever your plan is, keep doing what you love, Rick, and I'm sure we'll love it too.
Glad you're doing well, Rick. Thanks for everything...
All the very best regards to you and your family Rick. Thanks for all the vids over the years.
Hi Rick, thanks for the update and happy to hear all is well.  As far as future videos, I would LOVE to see one regarding my all-time favorite band, Supertramp.  Perhaps a "What Makes This Song Great" on anything from the Breakfast In America album.  I think Roger Hodgson is such an underrated guitar player.  Thanks!  ~Brent
Rick, wish you'll be very well! My brother had exact the same surgery here in Brazil with Dr. Fabio Gaiotto, on march 2024. You both have a new heart for life! ❤
Ich wünsche dir gute Besserung mein Freund und viel Gesundheit. Genesungsgrüße aus Offenbach Germany.👍👍
Stay strong Rick!
Glad to hear your recovering well Rick, for now i just wish you well and hoping once you are all good to finally get the Guthrie Govan interview ;)
Seeing you now, back home after that post is a huge relief. So glad everything went smoothly. Take good care now, give yourself time to heal. God bless you and your family
Endeavor to persevere!
Amazing isn’t it?… We‘ve come so far that you can sit there a week or so after an open heart surgery and you feel better already…
@RickBeato , I love what you said, maybe in the Keith Jarrett interview, who important it is to make a record and history of so many great players while they are alive. I love and appreciate that!
Glad to hear that you're doing well.
God bless you Rick 🙏🏾
Much love and continued healing Rick.
Just thankful everything went well. You look great. Your interviews are stellar, and may be you and your band can come together, and show us the process of creating and producing some songs
Be careful with some of your Les Pauls, some can be over 10lbs! Glad to see you’re recovering and hope for continued health!
That’s amazing, glad to see you are doing so well. Ric
So glad to hear you pushed the matter with your cardio, had a successful surgery, and pray for a complete recovery!
I really like the song breakdowns. The James Bond one was particularly good.
God Bless you Rick, you're a great teacher, thanks. I bought your Beato bundle to see your perspective on music. Stay gold.
Glad it was such a positive experience for you mate!
There's nothing scarier than the prospect of having your most vital organ torn open. Glad you're ok.
probably Phil X's buzuki inspired  weird picking technique triggered that disease 😊 wish you a speedy recovery, it is great to see you back in the studio Rick🧿
Uwazaj na fale z telefonu i jak przechodzisz przez różne bramki np metro itd
So glad your doing so well!
So glad it went well and you are feeling great. Sending you best wishes for continued good health!!
Rick I had a double bypass April 2,2019 I have a scar on my chest I had Open heart surgery I have coronary heart disease I'm learning to leave with it and feel pretty good these days God Bless You I hope you have a quick recovery!
Rick, did they have to quantize your heartbeat?
Good news! Glad everything went well!
All the best and the best of luck in the future
good to see you in great shape🎉 love from Rome🇮🇹
Glad you are doing well!
I'm your age as well and really like reflection and reassessments.  Going forward idea.. Lets continue with that theme and ask why do so many that should hang it up fail to do it.  And what are more appropriate formats to continue sharing their artistry ?   We see all the cancelled tours and I for one don't go any more.
Good to see you doing well. 🎸🤘
So glad to hear that your procedure went smoothly. Sending healing vibes.✌️❤️
I'm glad you are well! Looking forward to seeing more great interviews.
Have you ever interviewed Keb Mo?
Rick, you had the same operation my wife had when she was 63 and now she is 67.  Congratulations on a successful operation and recovery.
Hey Rick, I wish all the best to you, speedy recovery and that you soon get back your full health and all your energy, because you are going to need it for the now beginning second half your life! ❤🙏🎵🎶🎸 I always enjoy your videos, and I hope you'll be doing these for decades to come!
Rick, ask yourself: what have I not made a video on that should never be forgotten?
Rick, we know everything is fine, but do take a quick look at some coffins, OK?
I’m not a musician, so I don’t get much out of theory or technique videos. I’m a big fan of your interviews and of course, WMTSG. The energy you bring to WMTSG is incredible; it’s so enjoyable to see someone with that much passion for a subject.
Cripes, Rick. They kept me for 5 days and mine was minimally invasive. You look great! Best of luck.
You look good  Rick.. I had a triple bypass six months ago so I know what you are going thru.. I saw you in Chicago and watch the channel regularly. I've loved the direction from the early days of the whiteboard to the wonderful interviews. It is a strange feeling to just be put asleep and wake up with new parts and feel remarkably well..
RICK! I HAVE Mitral Valve Prolapse, (leaky valve)  Brother, lets stay healthy!
God bless you, Rick!
Glad to hear you're healing Rick.
I'm happy everything went well, Rick. Now it is important that you just relax and do as little as possible.   By the way, you make great Youtube videos!
❤👍
Glad you’re on mend, man.
I’m very Happy that you’re good to go now!! And as a Bonus, you met Johnny Monaco 🤘🔥🔥
Over 10lbs? So no les Paul’s right? hahaha
Great news that it went well. 👏
I think you should find artists that could have had successful albums in the past 10 years but werent because they didnt have the Music Industry behind them like artists 50 years ago.
I wish you longevity and prosperity, happiness, health, and wealth.
Good to see you are doing well. Last week I bought Mike Oldfield - Hergest Ridge (The 1974 Demo) Special Limited Edition on vinyl, I'd love if you could get an interview with Mike Oldfield and hear his comments about his early iconic albums.
Hope you have a quick and successful recovery!!
Great news Rick! Probably the best music related channel on YouTube. Here's to your health! 🍻
May the Lord watch,and keep you and your family, looking forward to more great shows!
Good to know you're brand new. oh,and for the record, You've got a new fan from Brazil here. I watched your interview with George Benson - He's one of the musicians who kinda taught me how to appreciate music back in my early teens - last night and I really like your Top 10 songs on Spotify videos. God bless you,bro!
Long life for you Rick!
<joke> videos recording singers. Seriously, quick recovery.  Anything related to music theory, especially advanced and super advanced levels.  I love the fact everyone teaches beginning music theory, but I've already done that.
Onwards and upwards. Best of health.
Congrats on your successful surgery, Rick! So happy for you and your family, and selfishly us, that all went well!!!
Thankful that the operation went so well for you!
Rick…Great to see you back home and doing well. You’re awesome and look forward to more song breakdowns and interviews. Cheers!!!
Great news to hear it went well.  Look after yourself, Rick.
Rick is now the Bionic guitar player!
Funk... I know I'll be going to have to do something like this in the future... But... chicks dig scars right?
I’m really happy for you Rick, walk my friend
So good you made this update, we were worrying). BTW amazing speed of recovery! My mom had such a surgery, but it was so much longer to recover. Stay strong and joyful, we love you!
Inspiring to hear such an upbeat account of your procedure for others who might face the same some day.
❤
My wife had mitral valve surgery in 2014. She's now 76 and as strong and healthy as ever. All the best to you Rick!
so glad your on the mend, love the videos around producing records.  as well as what makes this song great. just an Awsome chanel, thanks for shareing your passion and expertise and talent. take care.
🙏🍀Heal well! Then rock on! 🤘
Change your diet to Carnivore.  It will cure any metabolic and cardiovascular disease.
🤘
❤
Rest, please. Take your time to recover properly and rest. Take it easy. Chill.
I know it's Summer but your color looks much better. For someone who lost a parent to heart disease it was something I was noticing. Here's to a quick recovery!
great you are fine!
Rick, so great to hear you're well. As for your channel, when I was back in England, many years ago I went to a Jeff Healey concert and as I was sat in the audience right in front of him watching him blow my mInd, he was in between songs, a guy shouted out "Jeff, play (a certain song)." Another guy then should "let him play whatever he wants to play!" Jeff loved that and then played an awesome song. The concert was incredible and I have a life long love of Jeff Healey. So Rick, Always enjoy your videos, play what you wanna play 👍🥁👍
Wishing you good health and happiness.
All the best Rick !
All the best for you from Germany! You‘re videos are so great  🙏 Give me a call if you  come to Germany 🫶
You look great Rick. Glad all went well. Best to you!
So happy to see you're doing well Rick
God Bless Rick. Glad you're recovering. 🙌🏻
You're a great example of American Exceptionalism. Thanks for sharing. I have been interested and entertained for the past two years that I've been subscribed. Looking forward to what's next
I wish you a speedy recovery! Keep up the good work!
Glad you had a good experience. I had my aortic valve replaced twi years ago with a very similar lead up and outcome. I had mine done at Stanford University hospital in Pali Alto. It definitely makes you feel better. Its good that you did it and will be back making great videos.
I'm glad you're recovering! 🙏🏼❤️🫠
🙏❤️Thank God to guide the hands of the surgeon who saved your life from an early departure!  God bless You too Rick!  I have been watching your channel and Tim Pierce and NORMS channels for years and can’t wait for the next episode from each of you! 🎉❤ from just another guitar player - from the  sixties ✌️
SO GLAD to hear that you're feeling better !
Glad you’re doing much better!
Best wishes, Rick.
My brother had his mitral valve repaired and he's doing great! Here's hoping you recover as well as he did.
Take good care of yourself❤❤❤
we love u rick! happy to see you well
Great to see you well!! All the best ❤
Very glad you pulled through the surgery without any hitches.  I work as a Critical Care Respiratory Therapist at a heart hospital in TX.  I take post heart surgery patients off of the ventilator post surgery every day.  REALLY enjoy your channel and all the effort you put into it.  Hope for a few more decades of videos!!  Cheers.
Hi Rick, I guess I don’t have tell you. But I’m gonna. (LIFE IS A BEAUTIFUL THING)
I hope you'll recover well Rick.
So happy to see you're doing well Rick and also to hear the story behind this. Hope your recovery goes fine and you can keep doing what you enjoy most. Your channel is one of my favourites.
Glad you’re doing better!  I would like to see stuff about small amps and continue with all the other videos. Love your content
Glad you recovered so fast. Wish you all the best!
Glad it was successful.  You bring a friendly wonder about music and its performance that makes so much fun to listen to you.  Helluva good teacher.
I was gonna say:  Didn't they have to baling wire your sternum back together?  ❤😊 My friend had to have a quadruple bypass and basically get his sternum wired back together.  He needed a pillow to hug whenever he was getting up and down for awhile and had to wait awhile to pick up any gallons of milk.  I'm glad your feeling better. 💕
I’ve got a scar too Rick.  It defines us!  I was at the Cleveland clinic on July 12th too bad I didn’t get to see ya!  Unlike you, I was pretty sore after my open heart surgery, but I was only 46 when it happened, after a heart attack
New series: 'Heartstopping moments on stage'?
I have mitral valve prolapse too!
Happy you're doing well. Wishing you the best going forward.
Glad to hear you are recuperating well!  I am a RN and have taken care of many open heart patients, including the procedure you had!  As far as suggestions for future videos, perhaps highlighting "semi-pro" musicians and interviewing them.
Get well Rick! Blessings from Russia
GREAT NEWS, RICK! I love everything you put on your channel, so I'm looking forward to more! All the Best!
Can’t lift anything heavier than 10 pounds? Guess you won’t be grabbing any Les Pauls for a while…😂 Speedy recovery to you Rick!
Glad you are doing so well.  The world would be a lesser place without you.
well, that just flipped me out I have Mitral valve prolapse and a slight leak   and I’m always exhausted - and I saw my cardiologist last month and he said it was nothing to worry about - that everyone  has this after the age of 50.😮
Glad you are still with us.
Praying for you buddy! Hope all is well now! And for good!
Oh for access to the Cleveland Clinic
All of the interviews are mind blowing. Really inspiring stuff coming out on the channel Rick. Good to hear you’re doing well. Cheers.
Wow...I can't believe your home already (being on the Heart/Lung Machine). You're not "allowed" to drive, right?
from the healthy look of your face it seemed to work fine!
So glad to hear you're doing okay and feeling better Rick!! I was genuinely concerned when I saw the news you were in the hospital... Sending good vibes and wishing you a full, complete recovery and all the best! ❤
All the best, especially in health, Rick.👍
Glad your doing good Rick!
Keep on truckin man 😎
So happy you are doing well ❤  I wouldn’t change a thing about your direction. Love the in depth interviews, the breakdowns… all of it. Your channel is outstanding and precious for all music lovers.
Good news and hope it stays perfect! I’d like to see more «What makes this song great», those are always fun, especially when you have the stems/multi tracks from the sessions. And you could perhaps look at some new music out there that isn’t modern tripe like what we have on the top lists, but rather us people who strive to uphold the old school ways of composing and arranging. 😊
Glad you are feeling better! Wasn’t long ago a surgery like that would have you in the hospital for weeks afterwards.
Bless you, Rick. I’ve commented in the past on what a big heart you have and how it is linked to your success on this channel. So keep taking care of that thing. It is your best asset. I received a cancer diagnosis last fall. It does have a way of focusing my attention on the time left and how I can best serve. - Paul❤
Great news @rickbeato!
Glad you are well Rick.... 68 w/ moderate regurgitation - so this was very interesting to me....  Hopefully I can keep it moderate. So glad you are doing great.. Heal and feel well soon.....  Love your channel
Wishing you a speedy recovery Rick! Love the interviews you've been doing!
Glad you're "back in the saddle again!"🐴😎✌
Amazing modern medicine!! Such a quick recovery!! Good wishes in the days &weeks to come! I LOVE the interviews!! They have drastically broadened my music appreciation!!
God bless you, Rick.
Interviews with those older artist before they aren't.
Glad to see you're recovering well. We need you around to keep up your work as the great ambassador of rock.
glad to see your recovering well ,love your observations  on spotify keep it up, from a sunny england .
Get well Rick! Many greetings
Glad you're in a clean bill of health! 🥁✌️
Watching your vids ..and wishing you a very speedy recovery👍
What makes this song great is my favorite series, I know it must take a lot of time to be able to have tracks seperated, but I'd love to see some on guns n roses and stuff, not sure about the copyright, i assumed that is why you hadnt done them yet.
You now Rick are even a better version of yourself! We are all very pleased it worked out and you're on a speedy road to recovery. And man you're a national treasure, and just keep going brother 💙
Good to hear it went well.
Mr, Beato, I am glad you're on the mend and look forward to your coming videos. - Will
I was lucky that my mom was a nurse. She hammered into me that if something doesn't feel right, get it checked; don't put it off, regardless of how insignificant it may seem. That strategy has benefited me quite a few times.
We all love you Rick. So glad you're feeling better and here's to a quick recovery.
So great to see you back up and running so quickly.  Be safe, be well Rick and thank you for all the great content.
Thanks for the update! Looking great
Glad to hear you are taking care of yourself.  We need you around for a lot longer!!!
Great to see you are fine !! Your work matters to so many people.  You must realize you are creating priceless documentation of our modern era music. I wish you will interview and discuss music with even more amazing artists who we all want to “meet” through you.  Fagen, Page, Plant, Mitchell, Peter Gabriel, but also amazing talents such as Mike Mainieri, Tony Levin, Jay Graydon, Mike Landau, Carlton, Michael Franks, Ritenouer, would be fantastic to interview the Manhattan Transfer…. You need to get going… let me know if you need help !   Don’t forget new talents and talents which may not be super popular BUT are amazing artists and have made a major contribution, think for instance of Allen Hinds.    Great to have you back ! Now off to work :-) !!!
Great to hear you’re in good health again. Long may it last!
How was the R&R HOF?
Glad you are feeling better!  Here's to good heath!
Glad to see you again in good shape Rick. As you suggest us to do comments about future : could you please make some more "what makes this song great" videos. Thanks to them, my musical culture has enhanced !
So pleased you’re still going strong Rick and you’re looking really good for the upgrade!  Best wishes from Susie and Andrew Ward xxx
Long live Rick Beato 😊❤
Here's to a quick and full recovery, Rick!
Had the same problem since I was 16, glad you’re better!
Congrats on the successful surgery, Rick!   I'll check back in 3-5 years.
I’m glad you’re doing well and having a speedy recovery 😁
Glad to hear you pulled through successfully @Rick Beato! I love the in depth interviews but I miss the What Makes This Sing Great series!
Wish you a full and quick recovery. Best regards from Budapest, Hungary.
Glad you are recovering and healthy!
I’m so glad it went well. Sending prayers for you to never have a heart issue ever again.
Good for you.  I'd love for you to go and see God, but just not yet.
Happy your doing well! Sending Prayers and Positive vibes.
Yep, quadruple Bypass for me  last August.
Glad your doing better Rick
So glad it all worked out! I'm 62 as well and enjoy all your videos. Godspeed and here's to many, many,  more years!
Glad it all went well. God bless.
Glad you’re ok, old man🤘🏻❤️🤘🏻
So glad you're doing well, Rick. 🙏
I'm very glad you're okay, Rick!
Delighted it has gone so well for you! Love your work and looking forward to more of it!
Feel better Rick!
Love and prayers for you Rick
Glad the procedure went well.  Glad you're feeling better.
Glad to see you healthy & well.🎸😎
bon rétablissement l'ami
Didn't Mick Jagger have  a similar op? I heard his only symptom, was a lack of satisfaction.
Best wishes for your post surgery recovery Rick.  I wish you the best.
You mean the world to us all, Rick! Thank you for all that you do!!!
I am glad all went well. Rick, you are looking great.
We love you Rick ❤
Keep getting better,Rick.
As long as you feel better and got it fixed. If they changed your taste in music at all, we are driving over to Cleveland Clinic and beating some ass!!! 😂😅😂😅😂😅 Just kidding, glad your back in top shape! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
cleveland clinic - awesome care, awful inpatient food.
Not a Les Paul😂
Glad you’re home, and your open-heart surgery (on your sternum) went well
Good yo hear you’re feeling good… I like all the episodes but I will say when you get into e major minor Private First Class talk… I’m lost, but I still listen. 👍
No time to be sick for 'Denim Daddy Rick' ; rest well sir!!
Congratulations on a great outcome.  You went to the best place on the planet for heart issues.  Now you're in great shape to do that Jimmy Page interview.
God bless your recovery Rick
God bless you Rick
Bon rétablissement Rick (from France 🇫🇷)
Great to see you obviously well and optimistic as ever.
I'm so glad to you're doing well again !❤
The thumbnail scared me Rick. Like many of us who appreciate your channel, it is odd but we feel like we know you like a friend. SO GLAD that you have been monitoring your health (a lot of us men do not take care of themselves) - GLAD the operation went well and you are feeling good in recovery. Just think about the great conversations that kick ass scar will prompt, real bragging rights like the drunken scene in JAWS. Luv you dude.
Did you need to lose any weight to have the surgery?
Talking all that shit about current music, and they had to give you a heart ;-)   Gald you're okay, Rick!
<Oh, I can relate...had 3 bypasses 3 months ago. Suffered strong GERD...visited my doctor and told me my heart was a Time Bomb. 8 hours on the table and two dead with the blood/oxygen machine! Blow my Horn everyday! From heart-to-heart, Greetings from Nicaragua¡
Tons of love and best wishes from India Rick!
Keep healthy and keep going Rick !! I’m 61, same generation, different stories, but all united by the magic of music. All the best
"one of these days your heart  will stop and play it's final beat"- i hope yours will beat forever 🤟
Take it easy....
My heart goes out to you and your family, Rick! Hope your recovery goes smoothly. As far as videos go, I think my favorites are the top 10/20 lists and the reaction videos to newer music. Whatever you end up doing, though, I'll be watching! 😁👍 Keep it up!
Thats great news , take care Rick
I'm so happy you are doing well!💪💪
Glad to hear all went well Rick! Your channel and insights on music have been a great benefit to myself and many others.  We're all the wiser for it!!
You're just a youngster- join the heart club(I had a triple bypass last year) it's amazing how much better one feels after the 'cutters' have been at you- the surgeons are amazingly skilled.
👍👍👍
Great news! Really love your channel. Greetings from Brazil
Grat RIck, I'm glad you are doing well!
Best wishes Rick, I am just 3-weeks out of open heart surgery for a double coronary artery bypass
Hi Rick, Glad to hear you are doing well.  I've been following you for a couple of years now (2020).  I've had 3 "jump-starts" (cardioversions) since Oct '17 and one ablation (Apr '23).  Everything is day to day and these procedures help put the sunrises and sunsets in perspective.  I started trying to learn guitar in '20 and all of your various lessons / posts have helped me understand and enjoy the music and the journey.  Keep on keepin' on...
Rick .... I know what you went through. I had a heart transplant at 73 years old. Doing just fine now. Take care.
Hey Rick,;glad you’re doing well, sending you positive vibes!
No, I think this wrong, do your music analysis, critic, but keep out your personal situation otherwise it becomes a Rick Beato self-indulgence.
Glad youre doing well ❤
Glad to hear you're feeling so well. Take care of yourself, we really like ya, Rick.
Glad you're doing well Rick, keep healthy ❤
Thank you for the update. Very happy to hear that you are doing well. I love the interviews. They are  interesting and it’s important that there story’s are documented.  They will not be around for ever but what you are doing will be. Thank you Rick for doing this for us. God bless you
You are a treasure and my family and I are pulling for you and hope your recovery is speedy and smooth! Much musical love from North Carolina.
Glad you're home Rick!!!
Glad you're okay Rick. Here's to a long healthy run my friend!
I’m glad you’re doing better!  Super positive vibes to you, and a million Thank You’s for your awesome videos/posts. I look forward to many, many more!
So glad it went well! You rock! 🤘😎👍
Glad to see you had a successful surgery! I didn't know I had a problem with my heart until my heart attacks. After surgery, I felt so good that I was upset with myself for not noticing how bad I was. Never take your health for granted! Be well Rick!
Oooh, get well soon!!!
Welcome back master get 100% better soon
Rick you look great! Glad you're well!
Very glad to hear that the surgery was a success and that you are doing well Rick!
Onwards and upwards sir - you've always looked really well (for any age let alone 62).  Here's to to the next 30 years at least then !!!
Glad to see you’re doing well Rick!! Absolutely love your videos!!
Hello Rick. I am a 15 year old who had problems with my heart too. I've been watching your videos for about 2 years and I wouldn't have started playing guitar without your chanel. I really do hope you continue to live a happy life and make more of those fantastic interviews. Much love from a younger Rush and King Crimson fan ❤
Rick, I sure hope you continue to improve. My wife had open heart surgery a year ago, and she's doing great with slow but steady progress. I'm glad these skilled surgeons and cardiologists are able to do such amazing work.
Glad to hear the good prognosis, Rick.  I hope you continue to heal and feel better than you did at age 22!  One thing is for sure....growing old is NOT for sissies! I enjoy your channel so much.  I am a piano and keyboard player and you help me to understand all of the new jargon these days.  Things sure have changed, haven't they?!!! Take care 🐰🐰💗💗🐰🐰
You can't get any better for cardiology and cardiac surgery than the Cleveland Clinic. Great to hear that the surgery was a complete success and to see you looking so well Rick.
Happy you're back at home!
Wishing you a great recovery. You're the man Rick!
Keep that beat up Beato! 💪
Rick, so glad you are ok!  I watch your channel all the time and learn so much, even though I've been playing for more than 40 years.  I always learn something new on your channel.  May God Bless you and your family!  :-)
Whatever you do with your channel is fine by me.  I’m 74 yrs old and have suffered from chronic intractable pain for 20 yrs. God is using you Rick to bring joy to my life.  Thanking God for tuning the strings of your heart and now you’re ready to spread more joy for years to come.  Jeremiah 29:11 ✝️
No non-weight relieved Les Pauls for you, my friend.
Glad to hear all went well Rick, stay well and keep your great channel going. Thank you, Joe
good to see you back, all the best
So glad you're back and as always in good spirits! Keep it up! You're an example and inspiration in many many ways!
Great to see you back. Stay with us, man.
You look great Rick, glad it all went well 🙏🏼. Keep the videos coming Brother!
Wishing you a great recovery all the way from Lebanon. Rock on Rick. You're fantastic
Glad you're doing well, Rick.
Take care. I know it is not as easy as you make it sound since I had heart surgery a few years ago. MEL.
so thankful that you came through this ok. I know what you are going through, I've had heart surgery as well.
As Paul Harvey would say, 'and now for the rest of the story'.
Great to see you up and about Rick,take it easy..,if you can 👍
Thanks for the update. Glad to hear your story, and SO glad you are fine!
Get well soon, Rick. We need you more than ever!
❤ We all love you here ! You're in our hearts and prayers! Stay strong and healthy for a long long time Rick !!!
👍🏻🙏🏻✌🏼😊
Glad to hear it was such a success!!!
Im glad your doing well, I had bypass surgery at 62, I think age 62 is the magic number for most heat repairs for men, so weird!  Keep it real, and walk everyday ! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks for sharing your update Rick. Hope you get better soon!
Get well  Rick. Now get  Ritchie Faulkner on from Judas Priest!
No surgery is fun, so congrats on coming through it as well as you did. Now for another 62 yrs of music from RB. Party on Barth.....(in honour of Martin Mull).
Best care anywhere!! Proud to have worked there. Keep going Rick!!
Glad you are OK. Feel better.
Best of health to you!
All of us now the path we are on! (We try to delude ourselves all our lives), We never know when our time has come, we lie to ourselves, we tell everyone we are fine... I try to be a good person everyday, and I hope I shall be remembered that way....  When my day comes...
God bless you Rick! 👃❤
Man, so happy to hear you're okay Rick. This happened to a good friend, but he was in tons of pain after open heart and took a year to recover. It's amazing the difference quality surgeons can make.
💙🖤
Very happy to hear you’re on the mend Rick… oh and, don’t lift any Les Pauls 😂
Glad you’re doing well!
Glad you’re home, surgery went well
Glad you're doing good my friend. God bless ya.
Glad to see you Rick. Please rest :) We only get one of you
Glad you are okay Rick. You are our hope to help bring real music back. Thank you.
Interviews, breakdowns, theory lectures--all are good.
get well soon Sir Rick Beato
Fingers crossed for your fast recovery....I´m one year older than you and gone thru this 2 years ago....i´m fine now and so will you! Greez from Germany
Yikes! I didn't even know. Glad you are doing well!
Top 10 countdown on Songs about the heart. ❤
Glad it went well.
Wow, that's good news, I thought you had a heart attack. 🙏❤
Good to see yr back in the saddle.   I would love to see more song breakdowns from a production-side of things with a sprinkle of theory where appropriate/interesting.  Those were my favourite videos of yours.
I've got some leaky mitral and tricuspid valves as well. The tricuspid valve leak is most likely due to ICD lead placement. Right now, I don't feel any effects. Hopefully it will be many, many years before I need to do something.
I hate to say it because it's so important. But I don't trust doctors anymore. I've been just my diagnosed so many times I don't have any real real problems now, but I think I will just die of natural causes. And not incur a bunch of medical expenses.
Glad you’re on top of this, stay safe and feel free to take some time off. We’ll be here when you get back.
Interview the Dr. lol
Thanks for sharing and happy to hear you're doing well!
An electric guitar weighs more than 10 pounds, doesn't it? 😰
Wow you look fantastic for someone who just underwent major surgery! I hope your recovery continues to be a speedy one. I’ve had surgery a few times and always look like an ugly ghost for a couple of weeks
Wishing you a speedy recovery!  Do whatever you want to do, I'll watch it. Love the interviews, but I definitely miss the song breakdowns too. Rock on! 🍻
🥰❤‍🩹☺
I've been a member of the Zipper Club myself for a very long time. Happy to know you're through and doing well.
Glad you’re doing well. God bless you brother. Take it slow and then get back to your type A living. Lolol
So glad to see you well and thriving Rick! Love the interviews, but I would love more song break downs
Great to see you're doing well. God bless.
Love it all... Jus' keep on truckin' Rick.
Glad you are well Rick.  Also 62, I developed AFIB a few years ago so Im on blood thinners now...in addition to all my BP and cholesterol meds....and you'd never know it to look at me...bit of a shocker.   As Art Linkletter once said.  "old age aint for sissies!"  Glad you are well.  Take care and thanks for all you do.   Re. the future of the channel...good question....perhaps some business advice?  What I can say is that of all the music channels I subscribe to yours is the only one where I send videos to my non musician friends.   That's saying something and speaks to the potential size of your, perhaps, yet untapped audience.   Worth pulling on that thread...
Welcome back Rick! Glad you're making a speedy recovery!
Glad you're feeling better.
Way to go, Rick.  Get well soon.
Cleveland Rocks !!!!!! So glad You are feeling great !!!!!! Did You go to the Rock n Roll HOF?  Rock on Rick !!!!!!!
Man, had no idea you had to live with that for so long. Glad you're better
I'm glad it went well and your recovery is brief. I'm facing the same operation in 3-5 years (lol) but go to my cardiologist again next month. I look forward to your videos and interviews, keep 'em coming!
Take it easy for a while and let your body heal, best wishes!!!!
Take care Rick!
glad to hear from you !
Forgot to say you are looking so well,  Superb.  Keep up the good work.  I'm not a musician but learning from you is great.  Expensive but great as I now own a lot of music that I had never heard of before seeing your channel
Hope you are OK Rick - take it easy, man!
Great to see you back Rick! God bless you!
Prayer said for you Rick, hope you are fully healthy and thriving for many many years to come. Love your channel. Cheers!
I know how you feel Rick.  I’ve had serious physical problems over the last few years. You are an inspirational force.  Your channel was vital to me during these times.  I really relied on good things to get through the problems. Your channel is so positive and helpful. You only desire to teach.  You show with every video your commitment to helping people learn about and appreciate music.  Get better soon.  We need you man.  You are needed by your subscribers.  Glad to hear it went well.  Hope you are 100% soon.
👍🏻✌🏻good news
feel better my friend.
I live in the Cleveland area, and would have come to visit you if I knew sooner. Would love to shake your hand and personally thank you for all your various videos. Rest up. Heal up. You are important to many more people than you likely realize.
Glad to hear you're feeling great again! Love to see you develop a compendium of quality criteria for music, including such criteria as structural complexity, rhythmic complexity, and technical virtuosity, emotional impact (it is very subjective, but probably deserves to have a spot) - thanks so much for your work and tenacity.
all the best and good health to you, from Brasil
Glad to hear the good news!
Great to hear it all went well, and you're feeling better Rick. Looking forward to whatever you do on this channel, in the future.
Thanks for letting us know
Congrats on getting fixed up, Rick.  Be well.  So, you have restrictions on weight amounts you may lift, eh?  I reckon that means no Les Pauls for a while...
So glad you're recovering so well!
Wish you a speedy recovery mate!
😊🙏🏼
Recover fast and well, brother 🍀
As far as asking for input goes, I'd love more "What Makes This Song Great." Idk if I would consider them a huge band, but I'd love a breakdown of a Billy Talent song. Idk if would get a ton of views but it would make me happy. Im just "that important" of a fan haha   An interview with Deryck from Sum 41 would be dope too!
Glad to see you made it out ok!  The world needs you Rick! So take care of yourself and dont work too hard ok?
Glad to.see You well Rick! Greetings from Argentina!   Would You mind make some content about Jimmy Herring?
Thank You for sharing your amazing mind with us.
All credit goes to Jesus Christ who gave that Doc the ability to fix you up, and in turn to bring you to good health. Glad to see you recovering Rick. God Bless.
Wishing you well, Rick. I love all that you do - it brings me joy. Thanks for that.
Great to hear your feeling good. 👍 Keep well young Rick.  I had some pump work done in 2009 and I asked them back then  "So Doc, how long is this repair job good for ?"  "Oh we've had patients go for up to 10 years before they needed extra work done ..."  That was 2009 ... 15 years ago !! 🙄🤞
Rick, glad your feet are still on the green side of the grass brother! Good health and good content for another 20-30 years please!
Glad you're doing well Rick!
Glad to hear you are well.  Your  interviews are unique and will be watched for years to come. Throw in some song or album breakdowns now and then and its a pretty tasty recipe Rick.
have a great recovery and be ready for the next 62 years❤💪
God bless you and your family Rick- Thank you for your work.
Keep getting well Rick. I had same op 20 years ago and haven't looked back. I look forward to many more great videos, advice and the whole thing. Iain
thanks for the update glad you are doing well
Rick long time follower I don’t play guitar but I love learning about theory that goes into playing.  Your interviews are great and musicians open up to you probably because you’re one of them.  I’m happy you’re doing well.
As someone who has also had heart surgery, it's great to see you looking so well and recovering quickly :)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just keep a nice balance of different stuff on the vids Rick -  if ain't broke, don't fix it!
So glad that your surgery went well and that you are well!  Would love some videos about common mixing techniques, perhaps those often used to achieve some of 'todays' sounds.
🙏🙂👍
Glad to see you back home! Sending all the love from Spain ❤️
Welcome back, Rick!  Glad to hear your surgery went well.  Thank you for sharing the experience.
You haven’t missed a beat!
Glad you are ok. I love the interviews but think you should bring back WMTSG.
Glad it went so well.going forward would like to see more song breakdowns.
That's amazing isn't it, heart surgeries have come a long, long way in the last few years.  So glad to hear you're doing well!!💔💖  3xCABG for me A few years back. . .    Did you say 9 mi??? Holy Wow 😮   Been loving your interviews Hope you keep those up.    Take good care and be good to yourself... Do the cardiac rehab if they recommend it . ❤
Happy to know you are doing well Rick. Keep the videos coming.
Wishing you better health going forward, Rick. 🙏🏾❤️
Good to see you in recovery. Its nothing short of miraculous how far Medical Science has come in our lifetime (I'm 65). Praying you continue to a full recovery.
So glad it was a success!
Glad to see you are doing well!
My mom has had the same thing since about six years ago. 81 years old and still kicking, so you hang in there, Rick! Glad you're doing OK.
Looking good, Rick! Get well soon! Cheers.
👍
Outstanding news Rick ❤ and respect from Colorado 🇺🇸🤠🙏 continued and complete recovery brother ✌️
So glad you’re doing well. With regards to your channel, I think it’s the wide variety of things you do that keep us all hooked. As a non musician I’ve learnt so much about music that I’d never previously given a second thought to. Now I listen rather than hear music. Look forward to the next video, whatever it may be.
Thank You Dr Gillinov💜 I hope you have a speedy and complete recovery and be serious about not lifting things please. It’s true.
Glad to hear you're doing well!
I'm so glad the surgery was successful for you, and whatever videos you want to make, I'd be happy to watch. I've started your Beginner course to help relearn playing the guitar. I had to stop due to having Type I Diabetes and having to check my blood sugars sometimes up to 10 times a day, which made playing painful. But now, I've been using a newer, more responsive CGM, and I don't have to due an actual glucose reading only so often. I'm happy you're well.
👍
glad you are doing well
Modern Medicen is pretty amazing. Good to hear that you're fine. We'll all make it to 100 yet!
Been with you since early days and have learned so much.  Thank you so much for what you do.  It's good to see you looking well!  I wish you a full recovery and good health in the future.  My best to you and your family.
So glad everything went well! Glad you’re back! ❤🤘🎸
Glad things went well... crazy to think that would have to be paid for. In the UK we hand over a tiny amount of our pay packet and everything that happens to you in a hospital is free, from an ingrowing toenail to a brain transplant....
Glad you are ok, hang in there
62? In just 10 short years you can run for president!
Rick what are you trying to say? That you are a real person and not just guy on the internet that everyone loves?
Glad you're doing well, Rick. Best wishes and keep it up!
10 lbs? No Les Pauls, then. ;-) Glad you're doing well!
Good for you, Rick. Glad the surgery went well.
You’re a National Treasure on the other side of the Pond too! Good to see you fit and well, Rick.
Did you check out the R&R HoF? (it's right over there>) And yes, Cleveland Clinic is the bomb...especially for Cardio stuff.  Glad you're not dead...and stuff.
Good news.....
Love you Rick , stay healthy ❤🎸
Glad to see you're getting better! Godspeed!
I'm so glad you're doing well and you finally had the procedure. We need you around for many, many more years friend. :-)
Really glad that you are recovering well. I’m in kind of the same boat - playing the waiting game for open heart surgery to repair an ascending aortic aneurysm. It’s growing slowly, and I keep hearing “probably in a few years” from my cardiologist & cardiothoracic surgeon. It’s at 4.7cm and the surgery point is between 5.0 and 5.5cm. Wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery. You’re an awesome musician & teacher!
That’s fantastic! Glad you’re doing well. I had major surgery for my cancer on July 11. I’m now Cancer free but my recovery is a little daunting. I’m not quite back to my usual energetic self but Like you I can’t lift more than ten pounds and all kinds of meds and rehabilitation. So glad for you though.🎉
Glad to see you're recovering well 🌟🎵🎶Awesome!
Good news!
It's great to see that you are doing so well after your surgery, Rick! Thank you for the update! Wishing you continued good health and success with the channel!🤘🏼
Man my Les Paul weighs more than 10 pounds, just saying lol. Be careful and take good care my man!
So happy to hear you are recovering well.  Sending love and healing energy your way, brother.  Stay strong and take care of yourself.  The world needs your passion and perspective, maybe now more than ever.  Keep up the great work!  Love the channel and all you do.
Glad to see you up and about! You're looking great. My favorite videos are "What Makes This Song Great." As a classical pianist, I enjoy a) the theory analysis and b) being introduced to genres and songs that I might not otherwise.
Write a song about it
Looking great! Speedy recovery
Glad to hear that it all went well! Take care big brother! Much love xx
Thanks for sharing your experience.  I’m looking at the same situation someday. You’ve given me some bit of relief from the anxiety.
Great news to see you are doing so well.
Let’s go Rick, there’s tons more work to do
Good to hear you're doing better. Mitral valve surgery is more common all the time.
I'm so glad you're recovering Rick. I'm sorry you suffered (I understand  that).  Take the very best care of yourself because you're much admired and loved by so many 🌟
Hope you’re feeling a lot better.
Great to hear your recovery and progressing so well.   I just recently found your channel, so I don't really have any topic suggestions right now. Best wishes.🌷🌷🌷🌷
Stay strong 💪💪💪 Wish you a Speedy recovery
Glad you are doing well, take care.
So glad you’re ok!
Be well Mr. Beato
Good to see you recovering!
'Severe Regurgitation' sounds like a great name for a Death Metal band!  Seriously, I'm glad you're well and hope you stay well.   Best!
I wish you only health and stay strong mainly for your family and also for us, the viewers who learning a lot from you. 🙏🙏🙏
So glad you're ok now Rick stay well.🎸
Hey Rick, fantastic to see your doing VERY well in the post-op process!!! As for moving forward, on the channel, I would like to see more "What Makes This Song Great" videos and song breakdowns of everything from the 70's and especially the 80's to now. Just my two cents worth and thank you for all that you do!!
Great to see your recovering well!
Prayers, positive energy and healing light to you!!
Glad your ok Rick ! Enjoy you and your channel , but it's you that make the channel ! Peace and Love !
Glad you are feeling better. Health is important.
Welcome Back Rick! Glad everything went well-here's to a rocking future!
Glad you’re doing great, Rick! Heal well.
Bringing awareness 👍
Let's go Rick. Keep on top of it.
scary stuff no matter how text book a procedure. glad you're ok!
Glad it all went well  - you should do a Heart song breakdown in celebration.
Good to see everything went well!  I had an episode that put me in an ICU about 5 years ago, and now have a great cardiologist.  I'm going in for minor surgery next month, but it's not heart related.  Here's to hoping for a full recovery!
Glad to hear it all went well and you're in better shape now!  incredible to see you in such shape and spirit only a few days after surgery!
So glad you are well. Thanks for everything you do. I personally have learned so, so much. In the immortal words of Lester Bangs, “You dont choose music. Music chooses you!”
So glad you took care of this procedure, rest up and looking forward to more of what you do .
I was in hospital 4 days and result was that i have ALS syndrome just lost my speech and singong ability. Lots of strength to you Rick
All the best to you and full speed ahead!
So glad you're doing well. Stay healthy my man.
It’s great to see you in good shape ❤❤❤
Glad to hear you're doing well Rick! Regarding the channel direction, I do like seeing you break down songs, but personally I think the most important thing is just that you do what you most want to
Glad to hear you're recovering quickly.  Sending positive vibes your way.
I work at CCF, sorry I missed you, I would've stopped by your room to say hi!. Lookin' great!
Dude! Glad to see you got such great care and in a timely manner! I really enjoy your channel and I'd really miss you.  We're about the same age (I'll be 63 in a couple of weeks) and so far, I've had no warnings of any kind from any doctors about internal stuff (heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, etc). I'm hoping to keep it that way.
Glad you’re doing well, Rick!  You look fantastic and can’t wait to see what’s next for you and your viewers!
We take the progress of medical domain for granted. We do the same for the journey of most artists after we’re done enjoying their music in tough times.  Hope you feel better soon, Rick. You’re an inspiration. Thank you for always speaking for art.
Glad you are doing well.
Good to see you back on your feet. all the best. My 2cents - would like to see more what makes this song greats
Glad you're doing okay, Rick. All the best from the UK
Glad it went well Rick, speedy recovery to you. All the best.
Wow Rick U look great a week out from surgery,I had valve repair in 19,took me a year to fully feel good,energy wise,no lifting to allow your breastbone to fully heal,hope your feeling better!
Good to hear you are faring well!
holy cow, I missed it, but I'm happy you're feeling better.
To be more specific, you can play guitars except NORLIN and CBS.  😁
Never has an emoji been more apt...we ❤ you, man!
Glad you’re back and better than ever. Congratulations!  Thank you for all your wonderful interviews and content. Truly, some of the best educational content for all levels of students. You rock Rick! Thank you!
I have the same thing and hopefully have another 5 before I go in.
So glad to hear your heart surgery was a success! Wishing you a speedy recovery. Take care!
Regurgitation in severe mode... that's because of all the AI music you've been listening to!  Haha, good you recovered.
God bless and continued good health Rick!!!
I’m having similar surgery in a few months
A strong heartbeato!
Glad your doing well Rick!
Rick- glad you’re well and on your way to a complete recovery. I’m recovering from major back surgery two months ago and I urge you to just take it slow. It definitely reframes the work that you do personally, I like the balance that you have struck between breakdowns and interviews. Keep doing that; the mix keeps it fresh.
Love you Rick, thank you for taking the time to update your viewers. I’ve been a pretty big fan Ever since the first video a few years ago. Thank you for your hard work and effort you put into educating the world. Glad you’re ok and I can’t wait to learn more. I will get the ear training soon I promise I just haven’t had the money but I fully support your cause and spread the education you have graced us with. Love ya man!
❤❤❤
The Cleveland Clinic saved my brother's life more than 50 years ago. He had total bone blockage in his nasal septum. (Babies can't nurse when their noses are blocked) Too weak to survive splitting the palate to create a cavity, he was the first to have the operation done through the nostrils. He has made his career as a respiratory therapist.
Song breakdowns and what works and don't work in popular songs
Man we love you,l'm from Africa, South Africa, l was very jolted by your surgery thanks for putting us at easy,rest for a while and recover fully.We miss you❤ with love fron Africa
Great to see your well Rick🎸🎸
I had no idea! I'm glad everything went well, Rick!
Great good wishes Rick!
Congratulations on your successful surgery Rick. Very quick recovery.
I am glad to hear you are good, keep going man.
so glad you’re doing well!
Glad you are doing well.
Glad to hear surgery went well. Praying for your full recovery!
Glad to see you looking so well rick! All the best.
God bless you Rick. Glad you are recovering nicely!
Get well Rick!
You are all HEART RICK!. Blessings abound.
Very happy your surgery was successful.  I’m just a couple years behind you and I have some similar things my doctors are watching.   It’s crazy how once they discuss the heart, it really makes you step back and look at what’s really important.  Your videos are always a highlight to my days. God bless you Rick.
The Gibson double neck weighs more than ten pounds so stay away from it!😂

I had an open heart surgery back in 2019, when I was 16. I was born with aortic stenosis, and later developed mitral regurgitation, along with heart valve degradation. 5 years later, and I am doing perfectly fine.  I wish you a speedy recovery!
I hope your recovery is fast. God bless.
Good to see you’re well! My highlight of your output is the song breakdowns. The Deep Cuts series is crying out for expansion!
Glad you're recovering and heading for a better life.
One of the best places.  Lotsa of that heart tech invented there.  I’ve friends that had their valve job done a “CC.”  Co
Glad your ok Rick we need u
I’d love it if you started a series where you promote really unknown artists as people you should know. You could help tons of talented musicians with your platform. I know I’d be ecstatic if you talked about my music for sure!
Wishing you a happy
Glad you're doing better!
Hello Rick, good to see you're recovering well. Cheers from Brazil !
I didn’t know.😟 I’m glad everything went well and I hope you go from strength to strength in the coming weeks. All the best to you Rick. Simon, UK.🤘🏻❤️

Glad you're ok. All the best from South Africa.  Thanks for all the videos.
Glad you are doing well.
Keep doing the interviews! Try to get more playing out of these guys. What a great interview EVH would have been. Maybe Wolfie will agree to do it?
Wow, modern medicine is quite a marvel. Glad you're doing well!
Good to hear your surgery was successful!
Thank you !    My uncle found out they had same issue. They were in their 80's.
Big Rick, a big kiss it's wonderful to see you like this, a kiss from Brazil and come back with everything we are your fans, thank you for bringing us musical culture and life!
Heal well.
Glad to hear good news from you and your heatlh.  Big hug from Argentina!
I had no idea.That's great news, Rick. As far as I'm concerned, boing under anesthesia is always scary. (Is this the last light I will ever see?). Best wishes on your continued improvement.
Thanks For sharing.my My wife is a retired perfusionist so we know all about the heart lung machine. It’s fascinating what they can do nowadays glad to hear that you’re OK. Here is to a speedy recovery to you. Looking forward to your next videos.
Mr. Beato, I wish You all the best! Keep making any stuff You want, I'll watch it anyway.
Glad you are recovering well, and reassessing life !!!! Today is the first day of the rest of your life! BTW: I am just one year older.
Great that you are back and looking and feeling well.  Thank God for a medical system that makes open heart valve repair a “textbook” matter!
Speedy recovery Rick! Greetings from Bulgaria.
We're glad to hear it went well. Have a speedy recovery!
Great your back - a new direction and success for the channel!
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 (Some extra hearts, just in case.)
Glad you’re ok! You’re very loved by many! Hope this and other comments speed your recovery.
I had my mitral valve replaced in 2002 for regurge. My heart was already 33% enlarged and i was in CHF. i had John Bell Thompson from the Cleveland clinic. They gave me a million year warranty. I was 30. My chest still hurts.
Glad you’re on the mend!
So glad you're doing well! You look great!🎉
Good to have you back fit and well Rick. Onwards and upwards...
Take it easy, get well soon. You have such a positive effect on so many. It’s great to hear it went well. Thank you, Rick.
I work for a heart health medical company and im glad you’re educating your audience about this silent killer, is very much needed. I hope your recovery keeps going strong 🙌🏽
So very glad you’re feeling better.  God bless you.
Looking Good Baby!  (also, throwing in some prayers for you, can't hurt....)
Wish you well. Congrats on the successful surgery.
I had the exact same procedure done about a year ago...always remember, Rick---for you it's once in a lifetime, but for your surgeons, it's multiple times a day.  (the Rock 'n' Roll museum?)
RICK!?
Great to hear you’re so committed to keeping active.  Keep taking those walks.  Love all you do.
Superb
Very happy to see you well!
Glad to see you're doing well, Rick!! Glad to hear everything went well!!
Glad you are well, Rick. Hope your recovery is quick and easy and don’t pick up a Les Paul for 5 weeks😂!  (And more song breakdowns please - they are amazing and informative)
Whoa...yeah...kickstart my heart, hope it never stops.
You have a big ❤ Rick!
Happy to hear you’re feeling well!
The interviews are truly amazing.  They give the artist a chance to be seen as a real person and shine light on, otherwise, unknown and underappreciated humans.  Follow your heart through every aspect, because variety is key to health and longevity.  Be well, my friend.  Your health is improving.
Happy your doing well Rick, keep on truckin.
Muita saúde pra você! Força...
Glad you're still vertical, Rick! Thank you for the update. Thank you for all you do for music education and musicians,. You and your family are in our prayers. And although Marty Friedman will furiously deny it, please send my best to my old guitar teacher!
Glad to hear you're doing good. Love the channel. Please more guitar lessons.
Glad you're doing well, God Bless you Papa Rick!

Glad you had this fixed and that it went well. Listen to your body and get some rest. Another 1500 videos will require your energy! Always take your health first. I love your channel and now listen to the interviews during my 2 hr commute:)
Bon rétablissement Rick !
Thanks for being proactive with your health, and so goes the health of the channel.  I've commented on musicality / timbre suggestions in the past.  Be well!
Hey Rick, so glad that you’re well! My dad also had mitral valve regurgitation as one of the many comorbidities in his diagnosis before his death. I’m so glad that you caught it and got it corrected. Thank you so much for all that you do, your content is Always top-notch.
Hi Rick, wish you a speedy recovery, and keep on rocking, cheers from Portugal
Take it handy Rick. I had 2 heart surgeries in the past year. Don’t rush back into things too soon.
I am glad you are recovering. My grandmother had a mitral valve replacement in her 40s. She lived a long time with this condition.
Get well....we need your expertise and insight!
No suggestions for the channel, Rick. I just want you healthy and happy.
Glad to see you doing fine. Stay well.

All the prayers go out to you from Maui, Hawaii. I actually recovered quite well from a heart attack two years ago and I’ve just been putting myself into good health and the good shape and thank God I’m doing really well. It’s so good to hear that you’re doing good God bless.

So glad your surgery was successful! ❤
Looking forward to seeing more videos from you Rick!
Daje Rick!
🤓 Good to see you Rick
O2 saturation has probably gone way up in addition to looking at the Doppler flow in your heart.  Of all the times in the history of man to be sick - this is a great one with all the computerization and knowledge banks in medicine.   Additionally, robotic heart surgery is an amazing procedure. It’s like changing the valves in your car engine while it’s running.   So glad you’re doing well.
We're so back
God bless you Rick 🙏
Okay, but a long scar down your chest is pretty rock and roll.
Good news!   🎉
Good to see you back!!! 🎉
Thanks for sharing your story Rick! So glad you are doing well!
Good luck Mr.
My mother had her aortic valve replaced at the Cleveland Clinic over 20 years ago. She is still with us today, so they do good work. Glad you're also doing well!
To your health, Rick!
Wish you healthy days🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Glad you're doing well. I haven't had any severe regurgitation since I stopped drinking.
Best health for your family and you, always ❤
Rick, wish you the best! You are an icon!
