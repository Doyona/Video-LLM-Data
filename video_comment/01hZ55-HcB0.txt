INDIANNY DANNY MF DIMES
danny dimes more like danny dollars :p
It’s crazy to see this video in the middle of Indiana Jones’s breakout year😂
Sad lock never got a true shot, also RIP haskins.
Here to say INDIANA JONES
Daniel Jones shoulda been a round 4-5 pick, he’s the perfect back up quarterback.
2019 is like 2021 and 2022. A qb draft of busts
Call Haskins a bust if you want to, but I don't see it. He was on a horrendous Washington team and had a lot of moments that made you think "Yeah, he can be that guy." And I do think that when he went to Pittsburgh, the plan was for him to learn under Big Ben and then become the starter. And unfortunately, we never got to see how that would have turned out with him on a pretty good team under a coach that has a lot of success.
Rest in peace, Dwayne Hopkins I wish you didn’t die you didn’t deserve to die. I wish I could seen you play for a decade in the NFL or longer
Dwayne haskins death is tragic, but holy shit he was ASS. I don't know why yall are pretending he wasn't.
Kyler Murray looks like a 30 year old 6th grader.
Nothing is worse then when your team goes through a mike Glennon phase
Kyler Murray = Caleb Williams
I hope we cut Daniel jones
Kyler Murray just gets worse and way more lazy each year, it’s disappointing
Jake Browning? Not doing to bad behind Burrow
Loved dwayne never got a fair shake.
Kyler Murray makes me crack up every single time he runs....   so GD funny
Lock was done so dirty by broncos
That 2020 QB video gonna hit like crack in the 80s
I never like Kyler
It sucks that Haskins was using drugs... that guy was stunning
K1 is here to stay in AZ
Thanks KTO!
Man Murray was out almost the whole 2023 season but he came back with 6 games to do. A lot of ppl said why but with them sitting so high and the 2024 QB Class is nice, he felt, like many, gotta show them something and boy did he! He’s looked good as new and went into Philly and possibly dropped them from getting a 1 seed to all the way to 5th! Might’ve just ruined their Super Bowl run! Keep him!! He’s a beast!!
Minshew Mania was really a great time to be alive
He's a joke. No one I know here likes Cardinals unless they family works for organization. It's crazy. That's the worse book ever. I love Leo, only celebrity I claim. And i would never watch that movie. I haven't watched a movie of his since that movie. Daniel Jones is even worse. I don't understand how these less than average people get these contracts. Career high? After they put "computer chips" in balls. His eyes are even crossed. Why is this acceptable? Why has it always been that way Bradford to him. Overpaid dirtbag. Haskins story is too sad. Drew Lock was too sweet to fans. NFL doesn't like that. He needs a mentor. Not a competitor. He has good character.
Aye the Drew Lock game he just had was beautiful man
The 2019 QB class sucked hard
I've been curious how much the way a ncaa team is run and the culture created by coaches and staff can affect how a player does in the nfl and how they handle the tremendous pressure from being in the league
DH :-/
Being a giants fan to begin with is the most unfortunate part.
As a Steelers fan I would've loved to have seen Haskins play in black and gold as a starter. By all accounts he was a pretty likeable guy and nobody should be gone so soon. R.I.P
Props to giving flowers to haskins even though his career short. Very respectable
Having a good backup QB matters so much in the NFL. Think this year with all the injuries has really shown that more than anything. Minshew is gonna have a very long NFL career as a spot starter, and that's one of the best jobs you can have lol.  Also, RIP to Dwayne Haskins, really thought he was about to turn it around on the Steelers. I remember hearing a ton of reports about how much he was improving in Pittsburgh. May have even gotten to start again. One of the saddest moments in recent NFL memory.
6:10 the look on Kingsberrys face when 'HIS" QB was yelling at him says a lot.
Daniel Jones got a raw deal. Yeah he’ll never be elite. He can’t read defenses, stares down his receivers, and can struggle with accuracy despite throwing a surprisingly good deep ball. But awful coaching, a tissue paper o-line, fragile weapons, and front office malpractice for his first 3 seasons is brutal. I don’t think any young QB could have succeeded there.
Bro didn't even mention Trace Mcsorely
murray goes to seahawks next season
We can argue if Murray should have been 1st overall, but we can not argue about him being the best QB in the draft. I am a Giants fan, Jones is bad.
really skipping over Trace McSorely? this liberal media man 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
RIP Dwayne Haskins
This tiny dude is going nowhere  !! All hype !!
Seattle cleaned up in that trade with the Broncos
R.I.P. Dwayne Haskins, would’ve been a good to great QB if he got the chance on a real franchise. Gone too soon
Baker is 5’9” at best
If kyler is 5’10 then im 6’3 (im 6’0 even) 🤡
Murray is 5'8
Holy Hell, I understand the 9-19 record looks like crap for Minshew.  But 51 TDs to 20 INTS ain't too shabby.
hes not even 5'10 lol  i remember when i was in high school in 2013 there was a big wrestling tourney at allen high school and i remember seeing him and a couple other football or baseball players walking around the facility i wasnt standing right next to him but i was within 20 ft of him and i was at least 3-4 inches taller than him...... im 5'9..... albeit im sure hes grown a little since then but i dont believe hes actually 5'10 its been proven for pro sports teams to inflate height and weight
Louis riddick a joke lol
If Kyler Murray played for the niners the media would say he’s a phenom. If Patrick mahomes played for the Cardinals nobody would compare him to Brady. That’s how crazy these analysts are about labeling these players.
Rest to Haskins, but let’s stop pretending like he was THAT guy
Note to NFL personnel heads: 5'9" QBs are too short to cut it in a league where the average heighth for all players is 6'2" or so.
For the Giants, I think they suck so much this year that they end up drafting Drake Maye (hopefully) and seeing what they get from him while Danny Dimes continues to start
Can’t wait for the 2020 qb draft class 4 years later video
Baker has a way wayyy better arm then him.
No no the Giants fan reacting to the pick were correct. Daniel Jones is not an NFL starting caliber QB.
11:20 he was high on many drugs. What a quality man🤡
Nice
Murray openly said he doesn't need to study because he just sees the game and will make the play real time.  Murray is so overrated, without DHop he is going to crumble, no more jump balls he can just trust him to bail him out with anymore
After Murray’s first game back, I still stand by the fact that Kyler has never had an even remotely good O-line. After that statistic came out that during the rams playoff game he had an average of .8 seconds before his line collapsed should have been enough to prove that honestly.
Haskins would have been the Steelers starter too man 😢
Minshew will always be my goat
Dwayne Haskins, and all these young quarterback still don’t get a fair chances
Haha kyler I hope you flop 💯💯 overrated and overpaid
What about that kid from Briar and he's wrapping number nine
Trash qb class
15:34, uhh…what? 2019 was when the Jags thought they had their QB after they signed Nick Foles
RIP Haskins. Going in his current projection before his passing. He was on that bust/forever backup train. It's sad we'll never get a chance to see how he would of played. To be honest, I would take Haskins over Pickett. I think the steelers could of coached Haskins into a much better QB. Pickett doesn't have it, despite all the 4th Qtr comebacks.
Love the vid. Go browns.
Good ol' Uncle Rico Mindshew
The Jags werent really tanking that season though. They had just signed Foles to a big deal only for him to get injured in the 1st game and never regain his starting spot due to Minshews play
5 10 big no no, no wonder
I remember these same nfl talking heads calling the fiants "racist" for not taking haskins over jones lol...i remember that 😂
Play dubbed sus gloves
Jarrett Stidham seems to be a good backup. Played well last season with the Raiders. Now behind Russ in Denver so we’ll see how he does if he ever has to go in.
Murray is the real enigma here. It's hard to tell if 2021 the team was a mess, and how much was him? Signing that outrageous contract didn't help. Well, it helped his pocket book. But only the most die hard fan would think he deserved that contract. He has looked great at times, often by running. But his numbers aren't great. 25-35-1 as a starter. 0-1 in the playoffs, and played poorly in that game. None of that adds up for a guy taken #1 overall, making some $40m a year, signed through 2027.
As much sports talk radio I listen too...  I dont think or at the very least I haven't heard any one make this great of a comparison...That Gardner Minshew being this generation's Ryan Fitzpatrick...
Trash
Trace mcsorley
I hope drew lock gets a chance in Seattle!!
I was driving down the interstate when Haskins died. I passed the incident and saw him on the road with the EMTs. Obviously didnt know it was him until I read about it but still.
As a giants fan I do believe we as an organization failed Jones 100% given a proper team that has proper people around him he is definitely capable of winning games, an average qb is exactly what he is and that’s fine, not every qb needs to be a superstar. I full heartedly believe we move on from him and I wish he find a team that can actually help him prosper.
all busts
I'm interested to see how Kyler Murray plays in a traditional NFL offense under center.I don't think he ever has? He's played out of the shotgun dating all the way back to high school.I never knew who to blame for the Cardinals collapsing during the 2nd half of every season.Him or Kliff Kingsbury? It seemed as if defenses would figure out Kliff's gimmick offenses around week 7 of the season.Murray would look like an All Pro QB the first 7-8 weeks, but then look average to below average for the rest of the year.We'll see how he does with the new coaching staff.
Minshew is the goat🐐
Don’t worry everyone, Kliff Kingsbury has been able to fail up again.
Murray is overrated.  He came in with good talent and a solid defense, and they built it more. When that all fell through, he collapsed too. Again, wrong that it’s hard to prep for QBs like Murray. Many teams figured them out.
I think dj will tear his acl
The giants o line coaching staff needs to be fired and start a new. This line is going to end the careers of the backups
Murrey is the worst QB of the league. His contract was a STUPID mistake by the Cards owner.
Kyler Murray                                                                              .
I miss the days when a rookie could be expected to spend a few years on the bench learning the system and maturing.
RIP dwayne haskins. Gone too soon
how are you going to compare him to 3 diff QBs and then say he has a better arm and is faster than all 3? that's extremely inefficient analysis lol doesn't even make sense
Crazy the eagles traded ertz to a “contender” because they thought hurts wasnt the guy. Then a year later we r in the superbowl while former #1 pick kyler murrary is struggling
Kind of a weak draft....Murray has been enigmatic. But he still has had a better career than some other #1 overall picks. Nick Bosa and all those good second round Wideouts.
Let's not forget Kliff Kingsbury barely had a .500 record at Texas Tech with Patrick Freaking Mahomes at QB. I also blame Kingsbury for Mahomes being a "boom or bust guy" who went 10th overall instead of a no-brainer #1 pick on the level of Andrew Luck/Trevor Lawrence/Caleb Williams he *should* have been
And now DJ torn his acl 😭😭
Kyler Altuve.
and now the bust tore his acl lmao
RIP Dwayne, man. Gone just as things were looking up for him.
seeing this after daniel's injury man ...
Little QBs have to run because they can't the field.  That takes time which helps the defense.  QBs who run eventually get hurt, especially little QBs.  Immature QBs don't make great leaders.  Murray has all the physical gifts, but for those other reasons he's a high risk to build a team around.
Bro, do a video on the top 100 recruits from 2018. That class is crazy stacked with great NFL talent
If The Giants GM at the time drafted Dwayne Haskins instead of Jones, Haskins is The Giants QB giving The Eagles a run for their money & Jones' a back up somewhere in The NFL!! He's not a starter!! Giants GM was too smart for him 🧠-🤯=😶 Self
Good video
Nah , Nah, Nah 👎👎👎 the Cards are asking Murray to watch 4 hours of film that's part of his OVERINFLATED New Contract at 200 💰 Mill 💰😮!! He's calls it Silly?? No 🏈 franchise should have to make a deal with a player like that!! I take the cause off he gets traded!! I searching for a another QB via draft or free agency
Murray is a hit, uhhh.. how? Murray is THE bust of this QB draft. Would rather play video games than football, quit on his coach, threw a diva fit until he got a massive contract, injured far too often, & withered in the playoffs. That from the #1 pick is BUST material. Murray & Daniel Jones are both, AT BEST, average starting QBs, so to say Murray is a "hit" is wild.
Saw the name Trace McSorely in the first 30 seconds and instantly have to go listen to the song brb
Daniel Jones isnt even good enough to be considered average
2019 was a awful qb class. Haskins (God rest his soul) was a bust. Daniel Jones is looking pretty bad. Drew Lock sucks and even Kyler is too injury-prone and just a flat out head case to be anything good.
Uncle Rico is coming to get ur team to a 7-10 record while looking stylish!
Going to the Cardinals with Kingsbury was the worst thing for Kyler. Had he gone to the 9er’s with Shannahan I think he’d be a superstar.
Going to the Cardinals with Kingsbury was the worst thing for Kyler. Had he gone to the 9er’s with Shannahan I think he’d be a superstar.
Murray is trash. Been trash. And will always be trash.
Goatner Minshew
i watched minshew play at WSU, i know it’s air raid and all but guy is def a hype bringer
Kyler had a better arm than young Wilson? Try again! 😂
Daniel jones is a much better qb than Kyler he just hasn’t gotten a competent roster yet
Vic Fangio and the broncos let drew lock down :(
Kyler Murray was a good prospect out of the 2019 NFL draft!!! Kyler Murray is a success in Arizona!!! I love Kyler Murray!!! I 🖤 #1!!! Let's go Cardinals!!! Rise up sea red!!!
Jones is a parody of an NFL QB and I’d take Gardner over Kyler.
No Trace McSorely references?
15:07 he had also said superbowl losing QB 😂
Rip Dwayne! Dude could have been better than Kenny 🫡 tbh Steelers won the draft got a 1st rounder QB for cheap 👌 damn rip Haskins 🙏🏽
Murray has no business being a NFL QB
And Giants fans are still pissed with the DJ pick.  My god...he was onky drafted in 2019??? With as many head coaches and O coordinators who have come and gone i coukd have sworn he got picked 2017....   Sigh, just let the misery end already!
Kyler does not a have a better arm than Baker don’t go losing accountability now😂
Funny how the comments don’t talk about kyler cause the YouTuber actually highlights the injuries that the casual nfl fans ignore for their arguments of “Kyler collapses every year”
Give minshew a full track. Peyton didn't start out a star.
Murry is such a Trash QB. Hes a running back at best and not a very good one.
Daniel Jones ftw
Murray is a bust
Cards have played way better in these losses than the Giants have in any of their wins. Murray coming back gets them out of the basement while still having a ton of draft capital in the next draft. I don't think they go on a playoff run, but finishing with 6 or 7 wins once he comes back is absolutely realistic in my mind. they still have some pretty good talent on both sides, not enough to win now, but enough to build around and seriously contend in the next 2-3 years
Literally only Kyler was a good QB from this draft
saying murray has a better arm then wilson is wild
For the love of Kyle Murray I hope he gets traded XD
Daniel Jones is more likely to see jesus behind that oline
Murray is a bust and we can all agree
“All I’ve accomplished in my career”  Which is what exactly? OROY?
Lol Kyler never had a better arm than russ what💀
I like Daniel Jones. I think he's a good guy with some ability. Wish him the best.
When someone's career year is 15 passing touchdowns and 3200 yds passing😂😂😂😂😂
Be more honest! kyler murray is 🗑
And of course like typical in this world nowadays they claimed racism because of that study clause
Murray is another rg3
4 years later and the Giants still couldn’t give DJ a chance.
I still believe Lock could at worst be a top 15-20 QB as a starter. And with the right Coach could even push closer to the 10-15 range
Damn double xp Murray is a complete bust 👎🏻
Murray is a bust
Cards will move on and their doing the smart things with their roster now,,, their getting alot of crap over their draft but it's actually pretty smart
How do you not show the picture of Murray At the draft standing on the chair with Roger Goodell😂😂
Lock jeezy what a legend.l.
I remember when minshew was contending for rookie of the year half way during that seaon
I like to imagine a world where the Jags decided to ride the wave with Mississippi Mudflap instead of tanking to get Trevor and they won a super bowl and Minshew was the hero. That's why they benched him. He was screwing up their draft pick
dwayne haskins ne er did get past the crossroads. His career went off the beaten path.
Giants fans anytime anyone is drafted: NOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYY
He really is the next Fitzpatrick, just switched the beard for the stache
Drew Lock with the right offensive minded coach could be an average QB
With what Minshew costs to have on a team and the current qb market If I was a gm he would be my guy. Build the team around him with playmakers you can pay and boom. Also 21 tds to 6 ints is a very impressive statistic, and the Jags were bad when he was there. I feel like he is never going to be a top 8 qb but I think he definitely is a top 20 and factor in the cost of him… huge hit. In no world do I think Daniel Jones is better than him and Daniel Jones gets what 238 million more for throwing to the wrong team.
Can you do what happened to the top 10 recruits from 2015
I've been waiting for one of these videos for so long
Shout out Jarrett Stidham
Players don't tank.
Call me crazy, but Rookie Daniel Jones was awesome
No one is guaranteed the next minute so there is no such thing as dying too young
No Kyler Murray when he was in hs.................. your talking about literal god playing football
Another banger as always.. I love gettin in the mood to watch!
As I Giants fan, still to this day I’m confused why the Giants took a guy no one was gonna take so early, they had two 1st rd picks, they could have took LB Josh Allen and then DJ right after or even the 2nd round, they at least got Dexter Lawrence with their second 1st rd pick tho
Minshew could be a legit starter for a team that focuses on him. He reminds me of a Nick Foles/Ryan Fitzpatrick type but a bit better
I am impressed at how you handled talking about Haskins.   Also Lock was the one QB outside of Murray I thought would work out if he had a good coach. Unfortunately he didn’t get one
whats ur instagram
Kyler Murray may come back from his torn acl
Still believe that Kyler shouldn't have won ROTY. His season was good, but either AJ Brown or DK Metcalf were more worthy for what they did. Just my opinion though
They all busts
Minshew a dawg
No one thought 2021 Cardinals are a contender
We drafting a qb.  - A Giants fan
At some point someone is going to have to sign Gardner Minshew as their starting QB.
Stop thinking these elusive super "athletic " quarterbacks that got by on their athletic abilities in high-school and college. How many "athletic " quarterbacks have seen real success in the NFL.
That 2021 off season was a DISASTER for the cards, soooo much unnecessary drama dragging down Murray
You're all FIRED!
It's a shame that turd Kyler got to play in the league, and his father didn't.  Also, his arm is not better than Manziel's was.
D Jones is another Gettleman special
I still wonder if Dwayne Haskins hadnt tragically passed away, does Pittsburgh still draft Kenny Pickett in the first round. R.I.P. Dwayne Haskins.
RIP DEWEY
It’s QBs*… apostrophes are not for making words plural, but for contractions & possession.
Jones shouldn’t have gotten such a large extension they should have said 25m a year or no deal.
That Kyler contract should have not been given
Minshew Mania forever
What’s wrong with The Great Gatsby? Not my cup of tea but Baz, Leo, makes sense.
I’m literally playing Madden Franchise mode trying to rebuild the cards 😂 what a coincidence
Cards fan here. I wouldn't completely rule out K1 getting traded for some picks. K1 was a product of Keim and Kingsbury, and I could see Ossenfort and Gannon completely cleaning house and removing anyone from that period. We've seen it already with Nuk getting traded and rumors of Budda Baker wanting out. K1 can certainly ball and the best QB I've seen play since Carson Palmer's 2015 season, but with Drew Peltzig as OC and Gannon as HC, it's TBD if he fits their scheme unlike the Air Raid offense of the Kingsbury years.
Kyler Murray tbh is probably 5’9
Rip Simba #ohio
Repent and trust in Jesus you will be saved I love yall and God bless
as a Jags fan, i loved Minshew and he was really fun to watch. but he has a lot of limitations and his stats are actually misleading (garbage time). not a franchise qb, but definitely a serviceable one however.
If the Cards get the top pick they are picking Caleb Williams
Love your video KTO and keep up the great work
Bums
Good review, though one error.. The Jags weren't expected to tank in 2019; they gave a huge guaranteed contract to QB Nick Foles hoping he could ignite that offense that got them so close to the Super Bowl in 2017. He quickly got injured and looked bad and after the team traded CB Jalen Ramsey, expectations got lowered.  Thankfully Minshew was good enough to make Jags excited before Trevor Lawrence got drafted
Daniel Jones never had a chance. The Giants o-line has been one of the worst in the league every year he has been in the team. He has never had WR1 to throw to and when Saquan is hurt, which is often, Jones just gets assaulted. Different coaches and schemes almost every year have made it impossible for him to really develop.
Hey, I still remember when Eagles fans booed Donovan McNabb on the day he got drafted in 1999, because they wanted Heisman Trophy winning running back Ricky Williams.
I get why Murray chose the NFL over baseball. Even though he could have made more money in baseball, the minor league years would have been rough, trying to play COD on that Motel 6 Wi-Fi...
why did you skip the 2018 draft?
I think you did a good job with Haskins. It’s a touchy subject and you were both respectful and informative
If I'm the NY Giatnts GM, I trade Daniel Jones, tank the rest of the season, and hope Caleb Williams declares and grab him, if not even guys like Drake Maye would be a solid upgrade over DJ
The saddest thing about Haskins was that, in Pittsburgh, he really was bettering himself and maturing. It was heartbreaking when I heard the news. Rest in Peace Dwayne Haskins
This qb class Fkin sucks , RIP Haskins
Dude saying Murray had a better arm than Baker is absolutely crazy. Baker still has a top 3 arm in terms of strength in the NFL.
Never got the hype behind Drew Lock but I will admit I started the Kyler Murray Rollercoaster high. Hope both bounce back.   RIP HASKINS
Dwayne Haskins!  RIP!! Go Steelers
Giants fan. its hard to judge Danny. I love Mr Dimes. but like you said 3 HC in 4 years is rough for a QB and without a solid O line is even worse. I think they keep him until next year. over the off season bulid him a solid O line and then see what he can do with those assets helping protect him. If he doesnt produce they will trade and or release him for the 80 some million hit instead of the full 160 million. if he has no protection you cant make plays. especially with his style of play, pocket type passer who can scramble if he needs too but its not his best part of his game.
This class is absolutely insane.. just cuz the QB’s weren’t good doesn’t mean the draft wasn’t…
DrewLock Shakur
Murray is trash
As far as DJ goes. Outside of his rookie year, he's never had a top 30 O-line, he's had three head coaches in five years, and has one of the worst recieving cores in the league,  Do I think that he will be an elite QB...? No. Could he be an average to above average starter? Yes if all of the pieces the Giants have are able to come together.
Minshew definitely seems like he’s going to have a Ryan Fitzpatrick/Josh McCown type journeyman career
Even tho I’m a Seahawks fan I really hope Kyler Murray bounces back. He’s such a unique and talented player
Kyler Murray is a bust. The Cardinals should be looking for Kyler's replacement
R.i.p Dwayne Haskins 😞😔
I remember seeing Kyler Murray back during my schools state championship he completely demolished us 😂
Lock never got a fair shot, his one full year was the covid year, he had no training camp no preseason. Teams all wanna draft these big arm prospects and then never wanna do the work to develop them
Drew lock could’ve been great if he didn’t go to the broncos or if they showed a little faith in him
I wanted the Jets to get Minshew in the offseason...but then they got Rodgers so they didn't need him. But that lasted 4 plays.
May Dwayne Haskins Rest In Peace
Daniel Jones's NFL career will end when we draft Caleb Williams
Daniel jones sucks.
The Kyler's contract clause was so stupid by the Cardinals. they didn't really think it through when they released that.
I can see the 49ers trading for Murray
How could you forget the kid from Briar Woods wearing number 9? Baker won the Heisman but next up Trace McSorley
Can’t believe it’s been 4 years man. Was a freshman in hs
Idk what it is about Murry he just doesn't seem like a football player more a baseball player who is Gracing us with his Presents on the football field. He's fragile like a baseball player too
Murray reminds me of Doug Flutie and both runs but theyll stop and throw and like Murray id a prime Flutie played today he would do great and Murrey if he can stay healthy will be a good pro but must become a leader on & off the field eat the ego and lead and just play the game and he will fine
As a Broncos fan, I had HIGH hopes for Lock. He had a swagger about him that we haven’t had in any of our QBs during this stretch.
Kylar is still that guy , i think the cardinals should trade him . Rip Haskins
Only 1 of these QBs won OROTY, Pro bowl honours and was a MVP candidate. Kyler is by far the best QB of this draft class. These other QBs were not held back by the pure incompetence of GM Steve Keim and a HC who had a negative win percentage in college with pat mahomes. Dont even comment saying DJ is better - he has more turnovers then TDs and leads the league in turnovers since hes been in the league.
I still remember the first time I ever watched Kyler play he legit looked like a child playing amongst men 😂
RIP Dwayne he was supposed to get a shot with the Steelers that year
We went from fitzception to minshew magic that's at least good 😂
One of the worst QB classes ever?
Kyler gunna prove a lot of ppl wrong
Jesus is King!
As a Giants fan this team is going nowhere with Daniel Jones. Should have never drafted him in the first place. Hopefully he gets cut after next season.
8:40 they still do for some dumb reason
This channel is the only one in existence where I always look forward to the epic ending.
2019 QB class all frauds  Murray got his money and dipped D.Jones is not/was never good enough  And everyone else but Gardner Minshew 😂😂😂😂😂  This QB class should get more heat than it does
It’s too early to rule out Kyler Murray, rest are horrible. Don’t dare say Daniel Jones is that guy.
The "Hail Murray" is a ridiculous name because it implies that Murray pulled off this great play. He didn't. He threw the ball like any other QB, the real incredible play came from Hopkins. Most recievers cant catch a ball in TRIPLE coverage like that.
As A Giants fan  I don’t think DJ is downright horrendous but he’s not a franchise qb and at best he’s a game manager   Giants need to finally move on  They’ve tried the experiment for years and it hasn’t panned out   It’s year 6 next season and if we keep him we’re still gonna be asking ourselves the same question if “he’s that guy “  Sure the offensive line has been terrible but we can’t keep wasting first round picks on that  And firing coaches for a limited qb is getting annoying   Personally i hope by the end of the season he changes the narrative but even then im still just ready to find another guy with a better skillset at qb   Even if you think DJ struggles aren’t his fault . Im still not sure what DJ has done to prove he’s a franchise guy especially considering he doesn’t have the high of ceiling either
Props to Dwayne Haskins for breaking “COVID protocols”, which were always a farce. RIP
Not the topic of the video, but Im a big Bridgewater fan. I like Cousins alright, but I always thought Minnesota got rid of Teddy way too quickly.
I never noticed how HUGE his forhead is wtf 😂
Still dont know how minshew is a backup qb in the nfl. Eventually a team has to give him a decent shot... right?
Most likely the giants draft a new QB
Hear me out the Minnesota Vikings should trade for Kyler Murray
To think you can go to a big time college and still be dumb enough to walk across a freeway
Kyler is a good player when healthy, but he does look like a toddler trying to escape his parents when rushing. 5’10” is definitely generous. Pictures of him standing next to other shortish NFL players of known height don’t seem to add up unless you add his large hair. His actual head is clearly less than 5’10” and the hair puts him over. Lock is a bust. He can have a big game every other week or so, on average. It’s always mixed in with horrible games where he looks completely incompetent. His career is pretty much an average of 2 extremes. He never figured out how to be consistent and that’s why he lost his job to Teddy and why he can’t get on the field over Geno. Those guys aren’t explosive but they’re more consistent.
Minshew might have the best career of any of the QBs actually
KM to the Vikings
As a Texans fan, that Hopkins trade still infuriates me. Bill O’Brien should be held liable for ineptitude as a GM. The Texans were good, like Super Bowl good… and he just melted it down to nothing.  That trade would be rejected in Madden.
As a Vikings fan, I would like to apologize to all Giants fans:  Just this last January, our dumpster-tier DC Ed Donatell (literally not heard from By Anyone since that day) architected the abysmal defensive performance that somehow tricked your “Coach of the Year” (lol) and front office into thinking Daniel Jones was some kind of Patrick Mahomes, worthy of multiple guaranteed years of Mahomes-level pay.   The entire league (except your ecstatic division) watched on like witnessing a slow motion car accident, reaching our arms out and yelling “nooooooooooooo”.  Yet the Giants signed the deal.  It’s not our fault. We just suuuuucked, but we gave delusional Daboll and NYG enough fantasy rope with which to hang you all, and they threw the team right in the Louis Vitton noose named “Daniel Jones”  …and he’s bad. Like, “not a starter for Any team that’s not actively looking for someone better” bad. Yet his contract was a Record deal.  I mean, WE knew our shit-ass defense. We’d seen it week after week. Even we knew he was that bad, and just walking all over a doormat that a corpse could rise from the grave and dominate. He just succeeded against Ed DonaShell’s faux-Fangio “bend don’t break, except always break, and A Lot” scheme.  Hell, there’s a whole Brett Kollmann video AND a whole Marcus Whitman (That Franchise Guy) video specifically about the disasters that the trendy faux-Fangio defenses became last year, with Ed DonaShell’s being the obvious (and statistically confirmed) worst of them.  We were like “Yep, even this garbage QB can just go for a jog if he ever whims to take 10 yards like walking to the corner store for a Pepsi” …and yet the Giants (and the Giants fanbase) were like “Daniel. Jones. Is. A. Dual. Threat. God.”  Sorry. Our bad.  Everyone eventually figured out that Daboll shouldn’t have been Coach of the Year… …but when people somehow got mad that 13-4 Kevin OConnel wasn’t CotY, we all just pointed out the he Hired, Enabled, and Protected the worst DC in the league …the man who sucked at coordinating defense so much he made Daniel Jones (who should be a career journeyman backup) look like Patrick Mahomes.  God we sucked on defense. Sorry.  p.s. the Kollmann and Whitman/TFG videos about the Fangio disciple wannabes are excellent. I recommend everyone check ‘em out. Just as critically relevant in 2023.  Again, we’re sorry. We sucked so much we made the Giants suck more also :(
You think Lock is at Seattle cause what’s Carroll thinks he can fix him? I think Wilson was successful because of Carroll
RIP Dwayne Haskins really liked picking him up in Madden rebuilds and was super excited when my Steelers signed him, still think we would’ve given him a shot at QB with all the injury’s we had
Murray is a massive bust. Then again every QB in that class sucked.
Rip Dwayne Haskins
I'm an eagles fan and I think it's so heartbreaking what happened to Haskins... and he seemed like a genuinely good person. Enjoy your life and your youth while you have it people
Daniel Jones was hosed for being drafted so high. Especially considering that DE Josh Allen was selected right after him.  If he was their other 1st Rd pick, or even slipped into the 2nd Rd, then I don't think he'd be getting as hammered as he does.
RIP haskins i honestly thought you where going to win the heisman rip man i hope jesus gave you the best hug dude ❤️❤️
RIP Dwayne Haskins 💛🖤💛🖤 I still think of what could have been with our organization developing you. Miss you.
Give Minshew a starting job you cowards
Horrible list
Minshew is a starter in the nfl. Justin fields , Daniel jones are backup quarterbacks. The nfl scouting & talent evaluation is outdated by almost 30 years. Murray & baker are not that bad. They are better than the Steelers qb along w the giants jets bears packers saints falcons qbs. The nfl sucks.
😨
Whatever your opinion is on D Jones I agree with that reddit comment. He seemed to get very loud hate from every fanbase the second the Giants made that pick. And it feels like people root against so they can be proven right at some point
Murray don’t got to say anything jones is a average qb Dwayne Haskins rip
Anyone else remember the trace mcsorley song?
You really should have used the clip of FivePointsVids melting down over the Daniel Jones pick, while Urinating Tree just laughs hysterically
Minshew played better than Kyler that year with better stats with a worse team talent wise but they wouldnt give him ROTY bc he wasnt the number 1 overall pick
R.I.P Dwayne Haskins 🙏🏻🕊️❤️💛🖤
I still think Murray shouldn’t have won rookie of the year, they robbed josh jacobs
I just appreciate any mention of Dwayne Haskins, I truly believe he wasn’t in the right situation to succeed in the pros. I can only dream and imagine what his career would’ve been had he became more disciplined and been able to focus in Pittsburg just Tom get his opportunity. Thank you KTO
KTO easily one of my favorite channels. Man doesn’t miss
To me; Murray is a person who he doesn’t have much feelings for other people. Idk if selfish is the right word. But he never thinks they lost cause of him and he never admits blame. Then you had his whole film room stuff. Just something off.
Alternate title: How The Broncos Get Fleeced by the Seahawks
How can you not bring up the qb who’s known more from a song than his time in the nfl
12:42 what song is that?
Perfect description for minshew👍 he is indeed this generation Fitzpatrick
Daniel Jones prolly gonna get traded, land as a back-up somewhere, become the starter and ball out
As a Cardinals fan, Kyler is the real deal. We just need him to get through a full season healthy, I think he shock a lot people coming back
Remember the 🐐 Trace Mcsorley!
Rip Dwayne Haskins
Another Great Vid, been watching KTO for too long, can’t imagine football season without these videos 🎉
KM to the Vikings!😊
"Jones isn't worthy of a 40 million per year pact" (cut) "4 years 160 million".   Plus any video that can dump on Josh Rosen is a good one.   Also. Kyler Murray saying talk of him not studying is "disrespectful" is hilarious. You know what's disrespectful? Clearly not doing the required work to the point of your team including it in your massive contract because you're not being a good teammate. THATS disrespectful. What a dunce. He's done by 2026
Rest In Peace Dwayne Haskins ❤🪦
As a jags fan I will forever love Gardner Minshew. Glad to see him doing decent in Indy.
Minshew shoulda won ROY
nice to see you do a post on this draft class and it's definitely a draft class that is still quite recent, but definitely seeing that Daniel Jones is definitely not what the giants is building for the future which is quite unfortunate for us, it's just really unbelievable
KTOOOOOOOOOO!! Since the Rams loss I don't think Murray has it mentally. I'd rather be wrong bc the league is best when there are more superstar QBs. But seeing how he handled that situation I don't have faith in him anymore. I think he knows it too and why he wanted that money now. Guess we'll see.
Please no more Pat McAfee clips.  Otherwise great content as always.
Call it what it is, Haskins was shit. Also pretty stupid to be drinking and playing in traffic.
Drew Lock better
Murray was only good because of Larry and Hopkins
So why dont the gardner guy come to Washington since he so good and deserves to be a starter or go to the steelers where the qb room wide open 🤔
rip haskins, remember him playing at osu. he was a great qb and his death is very sad
Burfict signs with New England
N the giants still paid him.. smh.. cuz Barkley had a great season
Love these videos
All busts
R.I.P Dwayne Haskins 🕊 🕊 🕊
.
Minshew should've won Rookie of the Year
As a Giants fan let me summarize the last 4 years of Daniel Jones.     Year number one okay wasn't great but the team wasn't expected to be good anyway. Overall very good very promising. Year number two okay this is someone good now if we could just have a good offensive line there's real talent here.  Year number three holy shit Holy shit they actually made the playoffs This is good more of this please.  Current season what the fuck.
Haskins doin pretty good
Kyler Murray is by far the most underrated player in the league lol. He's a top 10 qb and people act like hes a scrub.
The great gatsby is a great movie
As a Broncos fan, I'm disappointed in Drew Lock. RIP Dwayne Haskins.
I am a Browns fan and I am so gotdamned glad we didn’t take Murray. We aren’t much better than we would have been, but that little douche is a waste.
as a Giants fan, i think we’re gonna draft another QB in the near future as opposed to drafting the position we need (O-Line)
Okay, let’s be honest on one thing though in this video, *no one* was surprised to see the Vikings lose last year in the playoffs.  Even half the Vikings fans themselves were saying they were one and done. The way they won last year was incredibly entertaining but saying it was unsustainable is being generous.
Minshew will end up playing 20 seasons on 14 different teams
Would've loved more about Minshew in this video
It's time to trade Kyler"The Bum"
As a cards fan, I want Murray out. He’s really talented but lacks leadership that is necessary in the game. Likes to blame everyone else but himself. Hopefully Monty can trade him.I was really excited when they drafted him, but oh well.
Awesome, no 4 minute seat geek ad to start the video
As a Giants fan, I think it's time to move on from Jones after next year when we can get out of the deal. His ceiling isn't great and I think he's beyond saving at this point due to terrible coaching (more Judge than Daboll) and o-line play.
Murray was a risk worth trying out but I get the feeling he isn't going to be a huge factor for any time going forward. I feel bad for Jones for being drafted higher than he should have been. He didn't ask for that. I obviously feel worse for Haskins as anyone losing their life so young is an immense tragedy. Maybe he might not have made it as a starter in the NFL, but he could have raised a wonderful family or been part of a successful business. Just a waste of potential in general.  Drew Lock probably will have a good career as a backup. As a Seahawk fan, I think he can save the day if Geno gets injured.  And yes, Minshew is clearly the most beloved of the bunch.
You have soo many bad takes... Murray will be back this week or next at the latest...do you even research or just copy and paste some clickbait bullsheet?
Appreciate you for respecting Haskins. Ik his time in Washington didn't last too long but he was extremely talented. I really hoped he would be the guy in Pittsburgh after Big Ben retired. RIP Dwayne Haskins.
As a Colts fan I can say that I’m honestly happy to have Minshew on the team
2020 class would be a great video
Minshew’s rookie year is probably the most I’ve been entertained watching a 6-10 team.
Gardner Minshew should be a starter in this league!
Josh Jacobs should’ve gotten Murray’s ROTY
This class lacked any true franchise QB outside of MAYBE Minshew. Murray has the talent but appears to be too much of a head case to be the main guy.
I have no connection to the Arizona Cardinals in any capacity but as a football fan for three decades now I feel bad for them and root for them to get their next superstar. Damn shame Larry Fitzgerald never got a ring
And its looking like the 2021 mirrors the 2019 class.
As a Giants fan to answer the question. I do believe we’re going to draft a QB. With the way our seasons going we’re on our way to at least a top 5 pick and there’s way too many talented qb talents to pass up on for us. It’ll sadden me bc he’s not terrible but he’s not a franchise qb.
I feel bad for Daniel Jones as a giants fan. Because he is such a great guy and he deserves to succeed but hasn’t really had the opportunity. His first three years we screwed up his development. Then last year we see what he could become just to have it seemingly thrown away this year. It seems as if he’s regressed such as trying to force throws to make a play like he did his first three seasons. I got hope for the young receivers which if they pan out will help him but our o-line is absolute garbage to the point where it’s almost impossible to overcome. Anyways great vid KTO!
Daniel Jones got his money and stopped caring
Daniel Jones got his money and stopped caring
Was Danny a reach at 6 yes but I more shocked that he got an extension 🤣🤣
Have you done 2017 🤔
Kyler little ass not gonna last long in nfl
Wish the patriots would go and trade for someone like Murray
As a giants fan , Daniel Jones is the Dave Brown curse. Fans old enough know lol This team might be worse than those teams.
Well, the 2023 class is interesting.... young just beat stroud who has done very well. Levis, finally got a chance and went off. Richardson looked good but is out for the season.
kyler is still the best qb in this draft, idk how people think daniel jones is better
That's why Leon Edwards has the most aesthetic physique
It really goes to show how different the landscape is these days. QBs are more in demand than ever, and yet they are more fragile than ever, with more running and seemingly no-one investing in O-line.   The best way to develop a young QB is to have a good running game and a stout O-line, so you aren't putting him in harms way, nor are you putting everything on his back. He has time to learn, and doesn't need the perfect instant read because he won't have a DE in his face every play.
I was NFL bound until them Sebring Lightning bolt boys took out my knees in the Heartland Championship game of the 7th grade Junior high school round of 64 in 1997. Them good ole days as the running back for them Hardee Junior High Wildcats.
People were telling me Jones was better than Kyler in the offseason lmao
Love Dwayne Haskins he is resting in peace
I hope he gets kick out the league
Daniel Jones is the best player in this draft. Good enough play, held back by a lackluster o-line and wide receivers. On top of that, he is a good leader and doesn't create drama.
Worst QB class ever in my opinion
Downvote just because I have to watch two ads before the video - one of which was in Spanish. Otherwise I like the content.
i view kyler murray as michael vick but shorter and with a weaker arm  and A LOT more pro-ready
imagine if the giants didnt take daniel jones..
I will never forget being at a restaurant watching the surprise on everyones face when Daniel Jones got drafted 🤣
Giants fan here: the Tyrod stretch of games has more clearly exposed Jones’ flaws than ever before. Tyrod is a qb of a similar skillset to Jones, maybe a little slower in his older age but not by much. Tyrod got the ball out quick behind our shaky oline and when that wasn’t an option he extended plays with his legs, but in a different manner than Jones. Jones would just take off and run when any pressure would reveal itself, often for minimal gain. Tyrod would escape pressure and keep his eyes down the field, allowing for a broken play to turn into a 10+ yard passing gain by taking advantage of broken coverage and his running threat causing zone coverage defenders to pursue him. Tyrod also did not fear getting the ball downfield to our speedy playmakers. Tyrod does what is expected of an NFL starter. In Jones’ one good season last year he was in a system that heavily restricted his decision making to cover up his flaws of processing the field which previously resulted in many turnovers. The contract was a mistake. We have an out after next season. We’ll move on then and in the meantime, hopefully Tyrod’s rib injury isn’t too bad and he can return before seasons end. I wouldn’t blame him if he didn’t. Our team is a lost cause and I wouldn’t want to see the poor guy get injured again.
3 seconds in, hearing the word 4 quarterbacks. I already know this ones a banger.
Everybody knows that the best quarterback taken in 2019 was Easton Stick. I would say he's already a Hall of Fame candidate.😅 Edit. I'm joking about this guy but he has made nearly 3 million bucks or even slightly more than that in the NFL..
To every dip-whistle who said Kyler would be the next best thing......ha-ha
I think Haskins farewell tweet to Washington spoke values 🙌🏼 rest in paradise
Kyler is the kind of guy who can lead a team to the promised land. with the right coaching, of course. Although even with bad coaching he was a hit at Arizona.  Daniel Jones is honestly mediocre, he’s the type of guy who can lead you to the playoffs with the right team, but he won’t go much further.  Gardner Minshew can potentially lead a deep playoff run with a great team, but I don’t see him winning any MVP’s or super bowls.  Drew Lock is a great back up and a solid starter, but he’s more like a Daniel Jones type of guy.
Daniel Jones is clearly not a franchise QB, idk why people keep defending him 🤦🏻‍♂️ he’s an average starter AT BEST
Kinda crazy seeing the 2020 qb draft class after this, with 4 of them being some of the best QBs in the league currently.
Daniel jones beating the Buccaneers in his debut is so Tampa Bay Buccaneers 🫣
Daniel jones was a hilarious draft pick and an even funnier signing. Minshew is easily a top 2 QB from this class
Okay drew lock would be a above average starter if the broncos did what the bills did for josh allen. That is giving him time, trading for a top 15 wide receiver, getting a solid offensive line in front of him, and getting him some good coaches. The broncos ruined him
Early gang
Kyler is one of my favorite characters on Gridiron Heights
I think Drew Lock could be great, but he hasn't had an opportunity to start in a while
so sad about no trace mcsorley mention
Ain’t no way Kyler is as tall as me just like there isn’t any way Trump weighs less than me.
How you didn't talk about the legend Trey Mcsorley
I will say for as bad as Drew Lock has been, he has looked like he's developed his game in Seattle whenever he's hit the field.  Not sure if he'll amount to anything, but I would like to see him get another chance to start, and I say that as someone who wasn't exactly a fan.  R.I.P. Dwayne Haskins.  Didn't work out in DC, and I won't act like I didn't want him gone, but I was rooting for him to bounce back in Pittsburgh.  Gone far too soon.
Not bringing up trace mcsorely is disappointing
Daniel Jones is like Jay Cutler in the fact he's just good enough to get a coach fired. He'll throw for less yards and touchdowns in the process though too.
Kyler murray was not a good pick
Chances are that Minshew will have the longest career of the class
What’s ur thoughts on the raiders. Absolute dog shit right?
If Steven A is an expert on anything, it's idiots. Too bad he never notices this about himself.
If a genie granted me one wish, it'd be for Minshew to somehow end up on the Packers. I dunno, just -poof- swap him and Love.
God I love Gardner Minshew. Unironically, him at the jets is a playoff team. The real life Alex Moran
As an Eagles fan, I was absolutely floored when the Giants drafted Jones - I thought it was a joke at first. I thought he may have turned a corner last season, but so far that has been proven to be a random breakout that may never be replicated. I hope he remains a Giant for years to come 🤣
RIP Dwayne Haskins l. When i watched him at Ohio State, he was my favorite qb at Ohio State. As bad as the defense was Haskins had an amazing season in 2018.
RPO concepts and collective bargaining reducing actual playing time has ruined NFL offense.
I was happy to see how Josh Rosen turned out. How could someone be so arrogant with all of the things he said?
Aw you didn’t talk about trace mc. Sorely or Jordon ta’amu. Jordon lead DC to a championship and looked pretty good. I guess the Vikings might me sorry they cut him now. I hope he goes back to DC. Also trace could throw dimes. I heard it in a song so it must be true.
You should've included that clip of UrinatingTree laughing at FivePoints after the Daniel Jones selection.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that kyler murray has a better arm then baker and like the vid!
Great content as usual bro. Your video editing has improved so much from your first videos!!
Drew Lock was a lighter version Zach Wilson before Zach Wilson
That Daniel Jones is actually one of the worst things to happen to the giants. Jones is a qb that doesn't suck to bad, but he also not good enough to have a deep playoff run. The giants are stuck in the middle and it's going hurt them for next 3+ years
Josh Rosen was treated so unfairly by the NFL because you sent hum to the team with the worst o line and a past his prime wide receiver, and then you send them to even worse team this dude had no other Chance
Ron Rivera has been done for years . He can’t coach in this NFL
Only of COD wasnt invented
RIP Dwayne Haskins. May he be in peace.
Lol. Kyler Murray is the best QB of this draft.
An heartbreaking class that could’ve been so great
I think high key worst QB draft recently
When Kto posts you know its gonna be great
At least whatever you say about Dwayne, nothing can be worse than what urinatingtree, dudes a freak.
Video idea: the best free agent signings ever
KTO ik your a browns fan but do you have a second favorite team and if so, who is it?
The absolute best content on YouTube. Love me some KTO
cant believe this
It’s a great day when KTO posts
R.I.P Dwayne Haskins ❤️💛🖤
Drew lock could've been a star in Denver if Vic Fangio didn't fucking hate him
Good vid
I bet this is great...haven't even watched it yet
always a good day when KTO posts
Obviously Gardner Minshew is the best qb in the class
thank you kto for the great video :)
I saw this in 33 seconds YT got its recommendations down
Never been this early lol
first comment but excellent video already know it
