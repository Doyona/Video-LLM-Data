This has been quite the day! 🙏🚀🎉
Can’t believe this was 11 months ago
Nice
Bravo
Its kind of sad that SpaceX is developing faster than NASA considering NASA had a blank check from the US for so many years...   Gj to spacex for sure
So stoked for starship#3 launch!! Considering how much progress was made with flight 2, it keeps on getting better and better and makibg huge progress! 🇺🇲💪💪👍🏻🚀
They can launch all the rockets they want you can't leave earth impossible what a waste of time and money.
For those of you that don't know this is at Boca Chica in Texas at the very very tip of the State of Texas on the very Gulf of Mexico where are the Rio Grande dumps in. They catch illegals from China photographing everything down there all the time any well ruined Port Isabel Texas
Awe-inspiring ❤
Amazing ❤😊

It blows up and he calls it a success. Too funny😂
Is no exiting
Congrats on reaching 1,000,000 million views on this video! Just going back to the day where it all happened once again, 33-engines!
Marcus, congrats on 1,000,000 views!!!
Can someone explain why the test was a success despite the booster and starship blowing up?
The black jacket with a false rainbow pattern was the most hideous piece of menswear I have ever had the displeasure of looking at.
Nothing like blowing up BILLIONS $$$$$ to say success.
It took less than 5 astronauts ( no infrastructure needed) to launch lunar back Moon orbit, providing 100% success. We have to be better than that after 50 years because everything is way better now: materials, computing, manufacturings,….
cool👍Exciting! Thank you for your work!
So.. total failure of both vehicles..  How encouraging...
Like watching Disneys Fantasia. Same results. same outcome, great deception.
Let the booster slow down more before starting starship. You still get newtons laws working for you in kicking off the booster but less of a jolt against the booster.  "Do not forget this one thing. 1 day is as a 1,000 years." The stones at Gobekli tepe & all the tepes which were buried by 19 of Noah's cataclysmic east to west tidal wave deluges the last time earth's orbits eclipsed our stars magnetic equator are crying out. Mystery of the 7 star crossings Yeshua son of Yahweh held in his hand. Only the truth shall set you free from this planet.
I'm here to push the views to 1 million! woooop.
I thought the name of the "astro pub"  was The Prancing Pony.
So proud of SpaceX  Simply amazing community of people.
I feel like they planned for this to fail, the missing heat shielding, the failed engines and the just missed trajectory... Idk about coincidences and I feel like elon wanted that data
Satellites and space stations we've previously built will look like space dust in comparison to this things capabilities...
Cheers Bruce from downunder, good reporting m8..
A magnetic hitch would solve all of those booster engine variations
Im here trying to figure out how to explain to my brother that space exists because his dumbass thinks we hit the firmament because "the explosion looked weird" im just looking for the most detailed explanation of why it looked like that besides just different pressures lol
Do we understand that this idiot, Musk, can't even do a thing that was easily done in the 1960s....
Total failure. This entire over priced boondoggle should be scrapped and we should go back to the damn shuttles...
why super booster get toasted after Starship rocket ignition even though it have separated?
I’m over SpaceX. They keep giving failed results and deeming them as “successful” for PR. No other rocket company does that and their engineers are coming forward and saying this thing is just paying their bills, there’s no hope in the rocket
Sweet!  I'm really looking forward to IFT3.
Wouldn't stage-2, pushing off from the booster, attribute to some of the (suspected) sloshing in booster's tanks ?
👍👍
Around the 10:05 just moments before the explosion you can see, what i believe, parts of the rockets engines falling behind. Beter viewed at a slower playback speed and beter image quality.
199
Has anyone here heard of thunderfoot?
Unreal, so cool!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Final speed numbers and final altitude numbers both added up to 13... 24124, 148
Bla bla Bla Acts 2:38
Awesome 👍
Great Launch with the Starship Successfully launched to Space!! Its a Shame Lots of Ignorant Television Reporters completely missed the Massive Accomplishments of this Launch!! Great Video Marcus!
It exploded... How can you be so cheery about a total fiasco? And no, you don´t need to crash rockets to test them as Elon always says. Look up how many Saturn V rockets exploded. Correct, none, not a single one. You don´t need to crash rockets to learn how to build one, you just need to fucking know what you do.
Just remember that everything you show or "discover" is also being watched by the Chinese and N Koreans and will be used against us in the future if there is a conflict. Let's be careful what we show/say for the future good of our country!
.😅
What is with the rapid unplanned assemblies, why are we so afraid to say explosion?

Felix Schlang reports that the vertical tanks were damaged again in IFT2 and that there was some damage to the booster quick disconnect - but he doesn't elaborate! Is it true? Were the vertical methane (now water) tanks damaged again during IFT2. Was there any damage to the quick disconnect equipment? Where is this information coming from?
I'll be visiting NASA and SpaceX this week...so excited!
Cool
Nice show but still cannot see how this could bacome an interplanet starship in the future. This starship need better fuel and propulsion systems to at least reach the moon first then Mars.
AWESOME
As per usual, another great video. I got a few beautiful screenshots for my phone background as well! Thank you for what you do on here.
muchios dienieros in the air
do you realize how stupid "unscheduled disassembly" sounds? Everyone knows it blew up. you sound like ur in denial.
HISTORY channel, after a few years: ALIENS BLEW IT AWAY.  What a good time to be born in. Saw the remnants of the rockets being dumped into oceans to, booster rockets coming back and landing on drone ships.   And yet still, some people like to dwell in religions and politics. If not now, then within a couple of centuries, our world is going to stone age again.
And yet there are these absolute moron flat earthers that truly believe in this firmament bs lol,apparently no space ship has ever left earths orbit 😆. Can you imagine believing that insanity !
Those views reminded me of the animation haha
If we're using methane we need to get to titan
Learn from ISRO, bunch of clowns in SpaceX can’t keep it straight😂😂😂😂😂😂
Manusia di larang keluar bumi,
Wow, history in the making… SpaceX give me so much hope for humanity. Elon Musk (and the entire SpaceX team) never fails in inspire me!  If only more billionaires could spend their money doing things to propel humanity forward rather than hold it back. No one is ever going to remember that shiny new car or that private island other billionaires are buying… history will only remember the rare, exquisite moments when human beings dared to dream. 💯
I believe in you man..
The government is shooting your shit down bra...look how they try to downgrade your cars you think they are going to allow you to build a space 🚀
3rd times a charm?
This is a perfect example of how private business can run circles over ANY government agency, particularly NASA.  It's about time NASA was phased out and the whole programme became privately funded and run.
Absolute top-notch reporting Marcus . . .as usual.
looks like a big fail to me
Why is it obvious to prevent leaking methane?  Because crazy people think we have something to do with the climate of the planet?
I noticed a little change in your Tazzy accent? Bit more rrrr in pronunciation FROM Aussie to US: BOOSTSA—>BOOSTERRR 😅
If this is the future of rocket launches they will need to build a massive stadium to accommodate all the spectators. Watching a Starship launch will be a must see event.
Great video again Marcus, thanks! Exciting times ahead!
fake
Outstanding summary Marcus....   Congrats on the 500k subs
The fact that they have been designing and testing this thing for over a decade and they still can’t get it in the air? Is a real clearcut sign of why NASA started looking elsewhere… Elon is grossly incompetent.
I remember watching the livestreams around SN10 +-2 like 3 years ago, so I have a lot to catch up on and it will be fun
To date this thing holds a 100% failure rate, whereas the Saturn V nearly fifty years ago only suffered a partial failure on one of 13 launches. Only Musk can twist a failure to seem like it's a success.
And I’m to believe that we landed on the moon in 1969 with the limited technology, yea right
another step closer.......
With this explosion, the price of starling and tesla just went up.😂
There's a channel called "common sense sceptic" who's dedicated his channel to hating on spacex. He's saying this was a huge failure or other nonsense. Typical
Its the voice of creepy dave lol
THis launch WAS AWSEOME AND STABLE, right up the point where it exploded,
I’ll explain the launch, “It Blew Up Again”! Sorry Space X Fan Perverts!
I've become less interested in starship development since Elon's insane running of twitter and decent into being a straight up neo-nazi, but cool to see some more progress I guess.
Why there was no camera fotage from Starship in the second atempt
It failed miserably ...
So fake, the actual flight went way past that point and separated before the booster had its FTS initiated.
Redesign this Stupid, Flash Gordon, Tube, it's an idiotic , un-stable platform that would just kill any Humans who would draw the short straw and fly & Explode in it. !!☠☠☠
Space x is at least 50 years away from achieving safe human transportation and further plans
Why is there so much "soot" in the exhaust plume? That's clean stuff, I thought. Is that nitrogen dioxide or some form on nOx?
WTF are some of these comments coming from. The damn thing exploded, as usual, and crashed back to earth. In any language, that's a FAIL. If this fool Musk actually sends people to Mars, I hope he leads the crew, because no one will come back alive.
500,000 subscribers!!
Curious; they had seemed to fill both vehicles full, but at eight minutes in it showed no fuel left.  How in the future can it make it to orbit plus 200 tons when it was already out of fuel?
Thank you for this comprehensive video breakdown
Incredible achievement, because they went a few steps farther from the last lunch, next will be resolving the next steps 💪
Just an open thought – What if the Starship Hot Staging sent unforeseen forces and stress loads into the booster that caused some sort of damage? I am sure the SpaceX engineers have a lot more data than we are aware of.
Brilliant in every way GO SPACEX GO
Tell me why the spaceship in thumbnail. Looks like a weak lightsaber
500K.  Congrats Monsieur House and the team.
👍.
Such barbaric caveman tech. So much physical activity to do so little💤
Mean as!
Debris field probably ended up near Puerto Rico because the earth turned underneath the slowing easterly debris field as it floated back down to earth.
Somebody shot it down with a satellite
They fire them into the ocean. It’s all fake guys.
Oh I was wondering why I was wasn’t seeing the YouTube stream
That whole Mars expedition idea is a tragic waste of money inspired by a two-faced genius/lunatic.
Rapid unscheduled disassembly! Explosion!
Reminds me of all failures..the explosions.. in the early unmanned tests of rockets in the Mercury program.  I guess it’s par for the course.  Learn from each one..rinse and repeat.
The engines remind me of the core of the Event Horizon.....
It didn't blow up... in the atmosphere! Wow! What an improvement!
33.....🙄
HAIL MARCUS! 🚀 Woohoooo!!!
It Blew Up Again, WOOO HOOOOOO.
Possible topics for your next update: 1. Why the brown exhaust when Booster 9 took of ? 2. The underlying reason for booster engine failure after spearation (facts and/or theories) 3. How is the system prepared for liquid fuel supply to the engines during and after the flip - the booster still moves in the original direction after the flip.
They seem to have way more problems that others doing these things are not. Honestly. They are making way to many miatakes in tech, materials, engineering. We dis not have multiple space shuttle crashes to finally get to a working model. The first one worked perfectly right off the bat.
By far a 100 times over the best video I've seen on this launch. Thanks
So the takeoff exhaust trail is mostly water vapour.  The exhaust from the 33 raptors is transparent.  That I did not expect.
Great overview of ift!
TikTokers pointing to the "firmament"................
Good job Marcus!😁👍
Looks like a another dame failure to me Elon Musk isn’t doing too well lately with his rebranded Twitter losing Subscribers and 2 failed space x rockets 🚀 And I hear his Electric cars aren’t selling as well as they were . could this be the guy who had so much cash he’s taking it for granted that he’ll always have it 🤔!!🇬🇧
Great job Marcus! Great launch test!
WTG SPACEX! Great Coverage, Thanks Marcus,,,,
Going… going…. Going… aaaaand, whoops, hit the firmament….. back to the drawing board… ok, let spend millions again just to hit the firmament. Go ahead, waiting on those angry comments to start flying.
MARCUS! Good vid, good flight.Looked amazing

Don't forget, blowing up both times is a success even though you should have the moon rocket technology for over 6 decades...
How can multiple failures be classed as a success?
You absolutely nailed this run-down Marcus. Great to see your unique perspectives with RGV and other details. You’re then man when it comes to Starship news! Thanks for another amazing video! 🙏😄
Simply amazing! What a time to be alive.
I was there, and I can confirm that they actually hit the dome.
He 500K 🎉
Hi Marcus. Well, it's been confirmed the FTS (flight termination system) was used on the booster section of the second of the SpaceX flight as it was determined that engine failures would not allow a correct return as I said. Safety first!  It seems fuel slosh in the tanks due to low gravity/ g-force was the problem,  I'm sure they will overcome that, maybe an accumulator bladder above filled with nitrogen to force all gasses to the bottom of the tanks? It also seems, the hotstage deployment was not as successful as first thought for Starship. The employment of the outer three engines worked well, but the three inner engines ignited too early and deflection back from the hotstage ring center cone may have caused engine bay damage. JMHO
Wowza, way to go! Wonderful progress made by SpaceX, & thank you for sharing this summary vid
The separation cause the problems. The negines were not protected enough and the booster was not sturdy enough to take the heat. Theseparation power has to be much much less.
This launch was the most awesome thing I have ever personally witnessed in my life. I witnessed CRS-29s launch from Titiusville 0n November the 9th and then the second Starship launch on the 18th of November from South Padre Island. There was little comparison.
This is sad, so excited for failure and not even mentioned the front of it fell off.
I'm amazed they thought they didn't need a launch pad with the diverter. I still think it should land in a hole in the ground. Sure it won't look as cool but the success rate should go up. 👍
Great job!!!! Excited for 3rd launch and landing
There !! I put you at 500K Subscribers !!!!! Congrats 🗼
01:18 compare this scene today with the cameras set up back in the 60s. Wow, they were Huge back then.
Not going to get past the Firmament EVER.
Elon "agrees with nazis" musk
Can someone tell me where I can find this full shot at 6:03
You dont need to launch to test 33 engines .. otherwise ? They did everything they should have done before ... :?
It's just a glorified helium ballon with rockets. Wake up.
Elon's latest and greatest over-promised scams.
Another successful rapid unscheduled disassembly.
On the day that piece of mechanical ego reaches the moon, it will be blue and there will be pigs flying round it. 😂
we should already be on mars with this "spaceship" .... all i see are exploding rockets,, a con man,  and a few companies that go bankrupt soon  🤣 just leave the space things to NASA .. at least they know what there doing
That was one of the best things I ever saw!
Insane progress
Didn't that thing blow up?  Musk bites
I think shock wave during seperation caused the thermal tile to disintegrate and exposed to the ship outer shell with high heat in turn caused the damage.
Congrats on the 500k subs, Marcus and Team! 🚀
Superheavy didn't limp of the pad this time she jumped!
💜
The amount of cope in the comments is so funny :D Fact is Space Karen got wrecked again, see you in a year :P
I like how they say that they're going to go through the data and find out what happened.  Good luck with the data cuz clearly you're not going to get any parts of that rocket back.  That was a perfect example to show people that space travel is still not safe.
I'm going to say this just bluntly.  You have a rocket that is 3  pieces, and two of three blow up.  When they aren't supposed to at all.  How in the hell is everyone calling that a win.  That is a huge epic f****** failure.  At this point there should not be any reason why the bottom stage blows up.  You have been working on that for almost a decade.  The middle part was supposed to stop all the problems but yet the first time you test it all together every part except for the middle part blows up.  Failed
I’m betting that destruction was very very well calculated. No one wants any international incidents.😂
As a fellow Earthling it blows my mind that I do not even see a bees dick of this type of content on the “Lame-Stream” news.   These launches could God forbid show everyone that we must try  and try again to achieve anything.   🇦🇺🤜🏼🤛🏼😎🍀🍀🍀
SLS worked the first time and sent the Orion to the moon
Just look at the shockwaves when the engines ignite!
Having all of those engines; which a lot have been in the ship for at most a year, work that well shows how well the raptor is. I can imagine the next flight will have some much improved raptors and will blow us away!
to much cgi
What a gigantic waste of money
It literally hit the firmament n blew up
Its still a massive fail. In terms of taking passengers into space, they are about where Gemini was in 1963. And thats was after nearly 17 launches to get it right...without astronauts. The only thing that improved on the first failure was that it took off. Then it blew up and scattered debris all the way to Cuba.
Great report as always- awesome successful test launch 🚀 on to launch number 3
Надеемся, что судьба Старшип будет лучше, чем у Спейс шатл!
TODAY headline ‘SpaceX Rocket FAILURE’.  Looooooool mainstream useless media
shift the camera higher. Looking down gives you a condescending look. Given the technical content you can come off as an irritating know-it-all.
This was a fantastic step! So happy for SpaceX. And sooo happy we managed to get a second launch before the year was out. Such an amazing day 😊🎉🎉🎉🎉
Now this was a proper flight test where at any sign of failure the abort system was activated. As much as I would of liked to see them attempt a landing it was nice to see that safety is taken priority. Let’s be honest their last test could of resulted in human death if the abort system was needing to be activated sooner. Glad to see progress but they have a long way to go. Let’s go space X! EDIT (Looks like a RUD)
Congrats on the 500k subscribers! Great content!
Great coverage as always Marcus💚🇬🇧🌱
Exciting
A point overlooked,,, how well the Flight Termination System (FTS) performed during this flight. The previous launch's FTS looked anemic in its operation. And was confirmed it needed improvement. Which the FTS was assuredly improved for the second flight. No delay in destroying both the booster and Starship once needed and initiated. Always better to have confidence the FTS  improvements actually worked well in real life to provide safety in that par of the launch and flight operations. Bravo @SpaceX!
Congrats on making 500 subscribers you deserver every sngle one them Marcus.  Thank you making youtube a better place with quality videos on space.
Great analysis, love your video and information provided.  100x better than most of the media! They get it wrong and largely on purpose unfortunately.
One step at a time until perfection. Go Elon and spacex!
So we never get to the moon before? Because this rocket did notreach that height.
That’s darth vaders lightsaber.
I can't wait for the next flight.
A foolish move to lead fire to a container that still had fuel left
Love the shock wave on ignition!  Congrats on 500K Subs!
What a joke😢
The Gov. seems to be ok with Spacex blowing up rockets. What we are witnessing is innovation thrown into high gear. Just look how many RUDs it took to get us to this point! There is a method to the madness. Great show bruv
Doin what nasa cant
Another "nail biting" failure....
congrats on 500k subscribers dude!
Best compilation of everything on this launch, as we have come to expect from this channel.
Great job Marcus. Love your commentary.
Starship made a nice bug on the windshield spatter this time.  Needed a wine cork pop sound effect.
Thanks for the detailed breakdown.
Thanks !
Seeing the booster work flawlessly up to stage separation was just incredible to watch.  Raptor is improving shockingly fast, and I'm convinced they only need 1 or 2 more test flights to get to orbit, and maybe 2-3 on top of that to get through a landing sequence test for both.  I bet they're only like 2 years off of getting through a perfect flight.   Just unbelievably fast progress, so cool to watch
Ohh No!! Not the flux Capacitor 💥
This “UP” was so great!!  Never before tried much less achieved and up she went.  Not a failure but  another piece to the Mars (and beyond) puzzle. I really appreciate your coverage.
How did the pad hold up?
33 engines 📐G🧭  Avoid the dome next time!
Congrats on the 500K buddy! I love your channel! Keep up the amazing work!
Why were the grid fins deployed/extended during the entire ascent?  Lots of drag
Impressive recount of the improvements, still some roadblocks to complete success. The 6 engines on the Starship bouncing their thrust off of the top of the Booster would presumably cause negative acceleration of the Booster, 3 against 6. Perhaps that was the cause of the Booster loss.
@sanjosemike3137  I have a solution for the fuel supply problem to the engines during launch. The crafts turn topsy tervy, gas bubbles get into the lines and the engines refuse to re-start.   This causes the craft to explode.   Solution:   Install large pistons in the fuel tanks that are under just enough pressure to make sure that no matter the position of the vehicle, the engines are always supplied with fuel.   They will take up space and due to their weight, reduce payload. But if the ships continue to explode, there is no Starship.   Please tell me if I am wrong or if you have a better solution.   Sanjosemike (no longer in CA)
Thank you for the most comprehensive explanation of the flight sequence I've seen so far....  😀
omfg i heard nothing about the 2nd test flight and i missed it live FUUUUUUUU
You’re the best Marcus
Fantastic wrapup, thank you so much @Marcus - awesome work! AND 500K subs, well deserved mate - congratulations!
i was hoping for a big explosion on the launch pad this time, well maybe the next rocket will go bang, bang on the launch pad !!!
outstanding Marcus & team.
The Worlds most expensive fireworks company.
🎉Congrats on 500k Subscribers! 🎉 Keep up the Great Work! It is always amazing and informative to watch your Updates and Deep Dives!
This shit is gonna kill so many people one day
Space-X is creating great creamatorial services. This is not a safe rocket for any astronauts.
Fantastic job from all personnel of SpaceX. Congratulations. It was an amazing 145 meters of pure force.
Glorious attempt at launching the largest commercial rocket. No coincidence, China's Leadership is in the country during this demonstration. What you don't see and is left to interpretation is the second stage being hijacked/hacked by United States Space Force (U.S.S.F.). Top Secret, smoke & mirrors. Remember, we now live in the Age of AI. Folks, that was a "wag the dog" moment; if I ever seen one.
SpaceX was soooo close!  Third times a charm, right?
Fast fact… the Soviet N1 rocket booster had 33 engines… also there is a Walter Cronkite narration of a Saturn V lift off that is fantastic… on YouTube
I have been watching many of the launch videos. I have come to the conclusion that the booster autonomously detonate becase a primary pump, either Methane or LOX, failed. If you watch the display of the engines you can see a pattern of engine shutdown that would be indicative of loss of propellant. With all 33 shutting down the self-destruct would have been required.  Now when you come to ship 24, note that the speed just before loss of signal was not yet enough to make orbit. If the onboard operation computer determined there was not going to be enough to get to orbit, it would have triggered the FTS and it was gone.  Beyond that, this was an extremely successful launch. Lots learned and endless excitement. Good work SpaceX and your team that put this together.  Bravo!

Hey Marcus, in your next video, kindly consider addressing these items:  1) Within a second or three after clearing the tower, the angle of the launch is NOT perfectly vertical.  -- Pointy end is up, flamey end is down, Check. -- But is that off-center angle nominal? ---- Kinda figured this angle was an artifact of engines out @ launch v1.0.  No engines out on launch v2.0, but something's still off-center.  2) During the first few seconds after clearing the tower, there is a black plume coming from one side of the vehicle - opposite from the camera POV.   -- Is THAT nominal?  -- If not, what is it?  3) Tim Dodd mentioned how purple the plume was.  -- His vid didn't show it, but yours did.   -- Might be worth mentioning / expanding.
That heat shield just isn’t going to cut it.
Can't help but compare the first Saturn 5 launch in 1967, rocket made it to orbit, all staging successful and back to earth in one piece. Yet ppl are ecstatic to watch Starship fail twice.
The twitter stream flat out wouldn't work for me and my grandparents/parents couldn't figure it out. Very unfortunate move that just limits how many people can see it with direct coverage from the source. Thank goodness for places like NSF!
Something about seeing all 33 engines alight gives me butterflies. Awesome images and awesome milestones reached, incredibly proud of what SpaceX is achieving. Great content too, thank you!
Im pleased with the result. Alot of progress was made and spaceX will figure this all out.
Thanks so much for your excellent videos, loving your work!
Absolute beast! Thank you. Of course, the headlines talk about this as a "failure," but this is really quite the win proving the hot-staging technique and the "stage zero" upgrades. The Raptors too were a win! Thank you so much for this detail. :)
Hey, hey.
great video
Did it run out of fuel?
congrats on touching 500,000 subscribers next week - who knows?  good show - as usual - looking forward to the next exciting episodes ♥MH - look at the infrastructure around the creator community how improved the reporting, cinematography, digital art, communications, universal translator, AI friends .. out sourcing space, education, (shhh Ed - that is a surprise  Gwynne said, yea but.) in truth a little hard to believe. sometimes  never mind (story for another time)
Booster:Kaboom! SLV:Kaboom! SpaceX:Yeyy!
Congrats on 500K subscribers!!! You did it!!!
Thank you Marcus
Looking at this makes me think that combustion looks so archaic, I bet someone in the future will develop gravity/electromagnetic lifting off.
Huge improvement over the first launch for sure! Can see them fixing the following issues very quickly. Third time is the charm!!
Hey congrats on 500,000!
Αποτυχία αποτυχία 👎👎👎👎
I mean 1:28
Booster 25? @1:30
I wonder if Elon would say the first principles source of thrust for a spaceship was "exhaust"
celebrating two massive failures. lol cute
They’re getting really close
Why did the starship FTS fire?  I noticed that all engines cut out about 30 seconds early and just before the FTS fired.  Could they have run out of fuel sooner than expected?  Well,  the starship was in the vacuum of space by then. Were the non-vacuum optimized engines supposed to have shut down for that part of the flight but were not shutdown?  That would have consumed more fuel.  No engines meant an incorrect trajectory and no way to fix that.  Time to self destruct.  Just guessing.  Standing by for data.
My guess on the booster failure was due to the fuel falling into the "tops" of the tank after  the booster rotated to top down.  That would starve the engines of fuel because the pumps are in the bottom of the tanks.  Notice the engine cut offs only after the flip.  To keep the fuel in the bottom of the tank the acceleration of the booster toward the earth would have to be more than the acceleration due to gravity (9.8m/s/s or 32 ft/s/s).  As I watch the velocity of the booster decrease after it's flip I have not attempted to calculate it's acceleration toward the earth.  Someone else can do that.  If this guess is accurate then maybe it can be fixed by having more engines fire in order to increase the booster's acceleration toward the earth thus keeping the fuel flowing to the engines.
Booster RUD or successful demonstration of the FTS? 🙂
I’m just sad they didn’t have onboard video. Normally spaceX always has cool onboard footage. 😔
Thanks for this summary. Since Elon decided to move launches to X I've missed everything.
Wasn't the original plan to only start Starship's 3 vacuum raptors during hot-staging so surprising to see they also immediately started the 3 sea level raptors which were very close to the booster's hot-staging dome?
Made it farther in the second launch than N1 in 4 lol
Me thinks if starship spun like  a bullet separation could be more controlled 😊
Congratulations on 500K
So now it explodes a little bit later and the engines worked.  Only 5 years after Musk said it would fly to the moon in 2018. What about the Mars Mission? What a waste of Taxpayers Money.
Great recap video!
The flight termination system was expected to be tested (since they had issues with it from the first flight test). But the loss of starship itself was kinda sad.  Great overall video and thanks for pointing out a few things that i have missed from the live stream!!
Wow - just wow  I am so thankful that we have Elon and his incredible team to make these leaps in technology to help humanity move forward.
Excellent second test, I can't wait to see the next one perhaps we can expect the Super Heavy Booster to land
delighted to see the rocket had adequate heat venting on the launch pad this time. It looked amazing piercing the sky but the explosions dampened my goodwill. Expensive mistakes to make but everything is a learning experience
Grouse
You do a fantastic job of keeping everyone update on space news. Love your channel
Since they weren’t going for full orbit, I wasn’t expecting starship to reach 27k. Somewhere around 24k would be enough to reach Hawaii.
They held the countdown for the beautiful sunrise.😂
Excellent video.  Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for all you and your team do.
I've never actually seen a rocket explode that high up before. Blows my mind how big the booster explosion was!!
great summary. real nail biter
@MarcusHouse THANK YOU Team House for this recap video! After the early video last week, I did not expect another and it was amazing to see a new notification.
Let's think about and appreciate the milestones...  Never has a rocket of anything like this much power or so big taken off.  Never have we seen 33 engines ignite and propel the rocket perfectly... ever.  Never have we seen rockets this efficient fly to separation, and never have we seen a hot staging of a reuseable rocket booster.  All six of the Starship's engines worked well at first including the vacuum Raptors which had never been flown before.  Let's not get carried away of course because there is still a way to go, but to SpaceX's credit, all the issues which caused the first test flight's problems were fixed, and given SpaceX's ethos and can-do attitude, the root causes of the problems which occured this time around will be found and fixed.
Nobody talking about the launch pad 😅 the poor launch
A great result for SpaceX, we live in such an exciting time :)
Great recap there Marcus, especially that last bit on the launch pad as I was wondering how that held up.
The fact that all the engines firing made a single giant Mach diamond was amazing
Marcus, you do an amazing job recapping everything that happened! Thank you for working so hard my friend!
You nailed it Marcus!!! 500k. Congrats!!!!🎇🎊✨🎉
We are all witnessing the birth of humanity’s ride to mars. This is truly going to be a pivotal change in human history. I cannot believe i was lucky enough to be born at the right time to witness such profound history!!!
The tests are progressing. However, unfortunately this technology hasn't yet been able to move beyond the giant firecracker principle in more than seven decades of launches by different countries. I'm still hoping to see in a few decades some breakthrough innovation where instead of giant explosive firecrackers, we get to see real spaceships more similar to the Enterprise in the Star Trek series.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Congratulations on 500k subs Marcus!
Epic flight...the booster and ship flew well...excellent stage separation...all amazing work..
I'm amazed that anything below the rocket can survive that much thrust
Not a spacey rockety kind of guy but what a brilliant summary 👍 👍 👍
amazing ....keep em flying space x
For me, SpaceX is a resounding success in testing the second prototype.  Alright, congratulations to Elon and SpaceX.   Congratulations and congratulations on the program!  I'm really excited!!  with the test!  I think late January, early they will launch the 3rd prototype.  The ramp has worked and the minor problems will be resolved.  What we experienced today is a technical feat!!!  Sant Cugat Barcelona
Bedankt
Baby steps... still moving forward.... nice overview Marcus,  as usual. Thanks team...🤔😎🇦🇺👌
Least it saving space in the Rocket Garden🤭🤭🤭
Maybe it disappeared by jumping into a tear in time continium 😮que
Buck Rogers crazy dream phantasy. Saturn V did better - never lost one! And that was 55 years ago....
Man.  That lead booster engineer is a keeper.   The thing worked flawlessly
Mission failure
*When are humans going to stop playing around with Fire-Works, and get into some intelligent technologies ???*
Thats much better progress than last lunch im expecting not the 3rd but the 4th to get to orbit or space
the hold at 40seconds was planned according to spacex
The whole process was magnificent but it is the SN15 THAT is the cornerstone and indeed the RAPTORS 3.0!!! are too violent 💥💥💥💢🦾🧠🔥🔥🔥🐉🐉🐉🚀🚀and too powerful at priming, this necessarily damages stage 0 at the level of the thrusters.💢💥  It is for this reason that to evacuate this length of jet force, the SN15 had been sheared all around the fuselage above its propulsion cones. A This triggering power of 600 tons over half a second over 3 or 4 meters explodes any bus where the SN15 NEEDS 18 or 20 meters of triggering one or more DESTROYED parts near these famous evacuation barriers.  The brutal blow of the billiard table must have sent back a piece of metal from the booster destroying part of the propulsion cones, a single engine destroying all the others plus the methane leaks below the tanks etc.  FINALLY these network evacuators of very limited capacity therefore for 6 to 12 tons of compressed gas at 3200 m/s for 001/2 second of consumption....  The exterior mechanical unlocking is actually less cheap according to the drawings but much more reliable without looking at the hands (SN15 + lights!!! horizontal)!!!  Probably hundreds of hits 2024-2025 if we consider the STARSHIP SN series AS ONLY ORBITAL SHUTTLE LANDERS AND NEVER AS CLASSIC ROCKETS.  ITS RAPTORS 3.0!!! IT'S BUILT ONLY FOR THE SPACE...SO NO DIY WITH THIS!!! by any No, others inside the nose cone PROJECTILES, SO TOUCH MORE.. LIKE SLS SO.. VERY good trips... RAPTOR are perfect at the beginning for the SLS 🌍🪐🌞🌞🤳🙌🦾 💥💢🧠🚀.  A version of the planetary lander plan for spacecraft + RAPTOR 3.0 propulsion on a 70 m high roof. Where should the SLS be as an auxiliary shock absorber with 5 lateral stabilizer pads, each measuring 20/25 + meters high, each deployable like the Falcon 9 activated by the depression of several external vertical degassing nitrogen chimney tanks.  SLS as an auxiliary shock absorber with 5 "T" shaped pads 1 📐📐45° to 90°  in exterior slide 🗜🗜1🌟2🌟5 ⛓⛓ lateral stabilizers with electrical output reverse charge control each 20 meters high, total deployable mass distributed over the center of gravity of each pad by several stools with folding screw threads (5 SWIRLS CENTRAL).  IN INDEF, they would be too short by at least 20 meters so +70 meters ship ( Total of ñear 475 feet long 🏗🏗145 m ) 🦾🧠🌓🌗🌛🌏 lunar + roof propulsion at the front of the ship) for this alternative navigation capacity and this orbital cruising speed of MACH 22+ (27,000 KM/H - 16,800 Ml/h).    SLS as auxiliary shock absorber to 5 lateral stabilizer pads of 20 meters high each deployable total mass distributed on center of gravity for each pad by several stools with drop-down screw threads (5 CENTRAL SWIRLS) actuated by the depression of several nitrogen chimneys of external vertical degassing.
Soon the great Journey will impregnate the stars with  humanity  seed
Nice recap video!
People who claim this was a "failure" are absurd. This is only the _SECOND_ test, and it's amazing compared to the initial Falcon testing. And yes, they already had the software packages from the Falcon program pretty much nailed down, so it's pretty impressive that this flight got so far into it as planned. I would not be surprised in the least to see the next flight nail it on all performance goals, which just goes to show how much they have learned over the years....
Great summary - thanks. Question - some tiles seemed to be coming off Starship during ascent. Does this suggest vibration/pogo from the first stage, or were they just loosened early and came off as ice fell away?
Well that was to be expected. There is a conceptual problem with the engines. You can’t turn them on and worse off reliably. However the tile concept is even weaker. They will never hold up to any kind of re-entry pressure and vibrations. Post-it tiles won’t do it. The pad held up well now, but landing even an empty Starship on free terrain will destroy it. So either change to a spherical starship with equatorial ring engines or build a real landing/launch pad on the Moon, which could easily take 10years, or making the lander a third the size of the current Starship. We don’t even think of orbital reloading and Mars.
Thanks again Marcus for your  awesome  presentation
Very impressive to see the engines survive much better this flight.
They nailed it, but they had to destroy it, for obvious reasons.
Elon Musk is the best 👍💯
It's interesting to see an old Soviet design still being used.
I can watch this launch over and over.
Amazing milestone.
i suspect the mission went more or less exactly as planned. by terminating both the booster and the starship there was no need to worry about orbital debris or the navigational hazard of a splashed down booster. though i would imagine the engine failures on the booster played a critical part in the timing. as far as the starship goes, by terminating it when they did it spent maximum time burning up and i imagine little if any debris hit the ground. there wasn't really anything left for it to do except burn up on reentry and this allowed space-x to show that the FTS worked properly. considering the recent hassle the FAA gave them i imagine that was the plan to start with.  all in all a very good show from space x and everyone involved should be extremely proud.
Thanks Marcus and crew
Was fantastic to watch Star ship fly and space x learning a tremendous amount of data 🇦🇺💖🇺🇸😊
Astronomy Live  channel has footage of it going over Florida Keys. He found it with software and a tracking cam to find it. Impressive shit. You see the crew compartment above the tanks... After FTS!  It was just after starship FTS and it was tumbling. My theory since it was only the portion above the tanks, it was the header tanks venting. Something was obviously venting causing it to tumble.  He also posted it to X Twitter.
Thank you for the full explanation! Great video as always!
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥💨💥🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫
Who IS THAT GUY with the HAT and striped coat?
Tkz for 'bonus' content. Wish Elon spent less time dumping on people on X and got to with using spare gear to start chop stick catching whilst the big bad FAA and FWS do their jobs.
Amazing how slow it looks climbing away from pad... I know it's just the size deceiving the eye, but it's quite a contrast with the Falcon 9 launches.
Wow! so exciting and it only cost between 5 and 15 Billion dollars. isn't it about time these wealthy  souls helped the needy and stopped playing with expensive toy Fire crackers that will eventually lead to f#*K all. The title of this clip is "SpaceX Starship Launch explained." It doesn't want much explaining pal, it FAILED. What part of that did you not realize?
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
didn't expect it not rapidlly disassemble
Possibly the best part of Starship is the redefining of "MECO" What was once Main engine cuttoff, is now MOST engines cuttoff
I watched many recap videos, and was on site for the launch. I wanted to let you know that your recap was REALLY informative and unique. Your breakdown and comparison of IFT1/OFT1 was really cool. I'm writing my own articles about the experience and sharing many links to other people's perspective, but I'm going to recommend yours first as it really does a great job at explaining things to people who may not know all the details.
I think the ship kicked the booster upside down and the liquid inside was to heavy to flip it back over
Just impressed by the whole work of SPACEX. They push the limits all the time.
Very nice work, Marcus! And great progress for Spacex
Do you think the the push back from the starship hot staging, followed by the flip centrifugal forces (the rotation would be centred near the heavier engines) would cause the propellants to move away from the engines  causing them to cut out?
I’m still trying to come to terms with the sight of 30 ft wide shock diamonds in the exhaust plume!
3rd times a charm! 🙏🙏🙏
One of the best reviews of the launch so far. Well done Team Marcus,
they called for termination, you can hear this in the stream.
Thanks Marcus and team!!
SpaceX has a serious problem with the tiles, as I suspected they would.
It amazes me how they can send people to the moon in 1969, and now with all the technology, the ship just explodes
Вам показывают компьютерную графику, а вы опладируете стоя... Включите уже мозг, друзья! и поищите не нарезанное видео
Fail
Why do they always rotate at an angle? Shouldn't they go straight up?
I was there.  I was totally not expecting the launch to push the sound into my chest.  I could feel the launch in my body.  Wave after wave of shock hit us there in South Padre.
Two things needed to happen to make this a step forward; all 33 engines firing the whole time, and a successful hot stage separation. This overall a success. I suspect the issue with the booster on stage sep probably had to do with the force that it was pushed away by the engines on S25. I wouldnt be surprised if they keep more than 3 of the gimbaling engines lit on the next attempt to counter act that and control the flip so that the propellant doesnt move around as much.
It was pretty cool hearing you in the commentary Marcus.
This was good. SpaceX are winning and No 1
Marcus, what a marvelous and professional condensed summary of it all.  What a wonderful spirit of cooperation by your other industry producers - all true professionals. Thanks so much, this is a milestone keeper...and just the right length - 13 mins!
Thanks!
its not that the pig flew well that's important. but that the pig flew at all
Parts of a launch tower at KSC. Starship and boosters sit idle at Starbase. All the tech needed to test a vital step to reuse. Catching.
Sure looked like hot staging and booster sep went ok.  i wonder what went unplanned there.  i was barely awake and saw what i thought was a nominal ship shutdown.  24k kmh seemed about right to me so i shut down and planned to watch the “landing”later.  Alas.  Wonder what happened to trigger fts.
I'd say that at best they are 40% to a reliable launch. They appear to be waaay off on their dynamics calculations regarding the fuel and the tank strength.  The footage here was NOT what I saw during the life launch.  THAT stuff was a glitchy s**t show from SFN.   Pretty disappointing. I suspect a local internet overload but who knows? In any case it was not good.  And you guys didn't even know the launch was re-commencing past the 40 second hold.  There was silence among you then POOF!  Launching.  Then you were making some comment about fuel shifting while the booster was in fact small fragments.  Check the SFN playback and tell me where I am wrong.  Conclusion?  They nudged a BIT closer to the goal.  The life covereage from SNF was about a C-.  I believe you are being overly optimistic about this all.  Hey, I could be wrong but they have a LOOOOOOOONG way to go to really getting this right. I hope it doesn't take them five freaking months.  The problem is, how precisely will they be able to diagnose stuff, particularly on the actual Starhip.  That is a tough, tough, tough one being that high and that far away with NO camera coverage.
Amazing work by SpaceX. they are almost there for a perfect launch. lots of learnings and increased probability of success in the upcoming launches
A brilliant report Marcus.  I was looking forward to hearing you talk about this as much as i was the launch.
Thank you, Marcus!  You always manage to add something new. As far as I know, you're the only one who noticed the staggered shutdown of booster engines prior to stage separation. Great attention to detail!
Fun fact this rocket is alot larger than the statue of liberty
unscheduled disassembly lmaoo it flat out blew tf up bruh
Amazing video, thank you to all involved it putting it together.
i just want to say to Industrial Light and Magic and to the guys doing special effects for star trek. yall indeed nailed it. looked just like their models breaking apart. the insane speed the parts accelerating is contrasted by the fact they werent seemingly affected by aerodynamics is freaking awesome.
another brilliant presentation, thank you
2 fails on one ship. Musk has a winner here. Just like his fiery Tesla problem
Third time lucky perhaps…
Marcus can you tell me why they dont use assisted launch systems (eg aircraft carriers) to get initial momentum established.
Wen IFT3?   :) just kidding... but wen
This launch demonstrated the first stage is actually perfectly capable as it is now to launch the Artemis moon lander, NOW, which should allay a lot of fears at NASA of it not being ready when the rest of the NASA-run program that is subcontracted to Boeing, Bechtel, with the people being ferried to the moon by the SLS.  Still to be done is to finish building and testing the lander vehicle itself, and they still need to demonstrate in space refuelling of it, but having a working first stage booster is a big step, given the fears that it wouldn't work at all, ala the failed Russian N-1 which had a similar engineering approach in some ways to this rocket.
USA is trying to blame other countries for space junk but when they're doing it, its a testing?! 😂
Something I haven't seen mentioned yet.... The Hot stage separation allows for the ship to take off from the booster safely, as in, as an escape ship should the booster have a RUD with people on board the ship!
Post the full video on X
They didn't even need the grid fin actuator as it happened lol
I wonder if a “water hammer” effect still happened, as well as sloshing that interrupted fuel flow into the engines after separation. This leading to engine shutdown issues.
what i want to know is where is this rocket originally supposed plan to be going?   if we can see half of this ejected this low. why are we expecting the other half to go any farther? 🤔   i mean like if half of it ejected 50-100 miles up. (even if i think its lower than that, bcoz i dont think we can capture this good video quality with 50-100 miles up but lets do say thats what happened in this video) but how far can the other half go?   surely it cant be over another 50-100 or so miles right? realizing with lesser engine equipment or perhaps gas it can hold to boost further in what the other half left.   and even if it does say go another 500 or 1000 miles up (which i think is impossible but) considering its weight is much less since its ejection and all  but my question is. what are they really trying to accomplish here? where do they plan to go? how far really is this perhaps test can reach up?  i mean the moon alone is over 200,000 miles and nearly 300,000 miles up as per science (though i dont believe its accurate) but still it dont make sense whats all this rocket is for?
Why didn't spacex put cameras on the actual booster and starship? Those views would have been great to see.
Would love to hear more about how people are taking photos of the rocket as it goes up, some of those images of the separation event seem insane to have pulled off!
Marcus is Jewish.
Like I've said over and over, why waste a starship each time on top of an as yet unsuccessful booster. Test the booster first with just a nose cone and see what happens.
Happened to see a mid day shooting star later that day here in Sweden 🤔Related?
Video starts at 5:40😅
Very impressive especially considering that the booster was traveling about twice the speed of a high powered rifle bullet when it separated from Starship and completed the flip maneuver to begin the boost back burn.  Huge progress.  Kudos to the SpaceX team.  I'm ready for flight three!
😂😂😂 it's amazing how far that condensation from the methane went.... couldn't even access the road...or see 20 ft in front of your vehicle
what a horrible failure
One small step at a time, closer and closer to success...
It is impossible to break the firmament. We should stop trying and turn back to God.
What a great progression for IFT2. Well done SpaceX!
I’m concern, I wonder how accurate the fuel garages were to real live. Ran out of fuel quite quickly. And didn’t even make it to orbit. Could you imagine space? Plus without a payload..  They will need to thin out the starship or get some faster raptors. Booster would just need a extra pressurized fuel storage for landing just like starship(problem solved).
My heart was racing throughout it all! 😬 Those 33 looked beautiful in the ascent… Well, now on to the next launch! 3’rd time’s the charm! 😆
Thank you Marcus for a good report!  (As expected, everyone else had "SPACEX Starship Blew up!")  You took the time to go through everything reasonably.   In the last seconds on Tim's feed, I saw what looked like one V-Raptor shut down.  The exhaust plume had a 1/3 rd gap in it.  Just before it went dark and then the energy release.
Marcus, your report is much better than the national news media!  Congrats!  Slava Ukraine!
big question why were there no on board cameras like falcon 9
Thanks for this extra video, Marcus! I saw the launch on Everyday Astronaut's livestream, but I would've switched to NSF if I knew you were a guest there.  This video is kind of amazing. You and your team have done a great job explaining what happened and putting it in context with the first test flight, and you did it so quickly!  You're so much more informative than the mainstream media, who can't seem to get over the idea the test "failed." This is a process of improvement that will lead to eventual success - and unfortunately it means blowing up rockets at the beginning of the process. (Where we still are, really.)  A number of Falcon 9's exploded before SpaceX got their design figured out, but the media didn't cover those tests with the same attention that Starship gets.  We know now that the steel plate and deluge system are a success, which is a pretty big deal in itself. Also they've got the engines igniting when they should, and the hot staging worked. All very important steps forward.  On the minus side the complicated plumbing inside the booster still doesn't seem up to the massive stresses that are generated during its flip maneuver. And the more mysterious failure that blew up Starship needs to be investigated. But these are things that can be figured out and fixed for the next test. Hopefully that will come soon!
It look amazing because it was a foggy day
If only Wernher von Braun, the father of the Saturn V,  were alive to see this magnificent rocket engineering. I believe he would weep with joy~!
Great flight... And as usual the mainstream media doesn't understand prototypes and rapid iteration and I heard the clueless saying on multiple networks that the flight was a failure. Why do we listen to these people (they are wrong on lots of other issues but never issue corrections on those either)
Amazing video
Beautiful flight. The only thing I can think is why not shutdown main booster engines just after separation instead of before so there is no deceleration floating the fuel on the second stage engines. The seconds lit anyway though.
I new that the second test was happening and I had been flowing the reports. When I was on tick tock I did not see what happened so I could see it on your channel first. This time it was much better and it got so close to it. Three times better will be possible the best to come... The launch pad looked good. And Elon and the team are so close now. The mars base will happen.😇😇😇💯
I would not be surprised if the flight termination systems were intentionally triggered after milestones were reached, since testing it in flight would likely be required at some point.
Well if nothing else they have a proven nonreusable first stage.  Bet there a lot of ideas for moving that much mass to orbit or further.
Where does all the debris come down?
Congratulations!   Super images and Texas coastal scenery!  Test flights are smart and exciting and how SpaceX perfects and ensures safety for future flights 🚀
2 minutes to reach 100,000 feet. Twice the thrust of a Saturn V my ass.
another successful explosion. congratulations musk.
3rd time's a charm.
Seeing this flight was just happiness and hope, about what we can achieve together when we sit around a meaningful goal, I'm very far away right now, but I hope to see in person the 4th or 5th flight.
The flight termination system was so much more efficient this time!!! So good hell yeah.
the level of excitement and joy during a launch. I would love to be with the employees during one of those "firsts", or "seconds". honestly, any launch would be ok... 😩 i can clean up afterwards...
Must have guidance into space.
This is worth rewatch. Nice visual comparison of IFT1 and IFT2
The data gathering in this is underestimated.  They just did thirty six full burn R2 and Three R2V tests at once. How long will it take to test that many B4s?
How are ‘we’ going to land/ takeoff from on the Moon if we can’t do it on home turf without exploding randomly…
Excitingly anti-climactic as usual. I look forward to the day when, in the attempt to land on Mars, Starship only makes it to the Moon after having achieved it's previously failed attempt to reach orbit.   They are gonna have to set their sights on Europa if they expect to fail by only landing on Mars.  But, hey... it is rocket science, after all.
when hop?
You guys are weird !  so easily satisfied !     Yes, I'm also happy I still have my motor running when I'm on the highway  for five minutes.  Wow it still works!.      Pathetic!!!
Thank you Elon for allllll your hard work! Just kidding, he didnt do sh*t. Congrats SpaceX team!
The number of _arrogantly_ misinformed people I've come across about this has been insane! That said, my predictions for FT3: • shorter time gap between 2 and 3 than between 1 and 2 • Superheavy has much better slosh dampeners installed inside its tanks • Superheavy does a slower flip maneuver and completes its controlled splashdown • Starship reaches orbit but *doesn't* survive reentry — that'll be on FT4, at earliest, I think
I knew it would blow up
Another quality episode.
Please, excuse my ignorance but: the booster explosion was premeditated? Was it part of the whole spectacle, it was intentional, or it was an error? Can somebody explain it to me, Please?
Nice comparison of test 1 to test 2😊
Great video and summary. I especially liked the close ups showing hot stage separation and frame by frame shots afterwards to illustrate elements of what happened. I'm sure the SpaceX engineers are having a field day pouring over the data and hopefully they received telemetry long enough and detailed enough to understand why the booster engines went out so they can fix it. It's a shame there was no video from either the booster or ship itself during the flight. That would of course have been even more epic. Also hopefully they got telemetry from Starship to understand why it appears everything just 'failed' with no prior indication. Even the announcers were calling out nominal right up until things weren't. Very strange. We'll never know why unless SpaceX shares, but we'll see with the next one how successful because they will incorporate what they learned. I agree the tile system may need revision/revamping in some way since the massive vibrations experienced during launch and assent seem to cause continued problems. Looking forward to flight 3 sometime.
I have a hard time getting excited about this. It's no longer about exploration, it's now a play toy for billionaires and literally nothing else. I will never get a chance to ride one of these. Space exploration is not going to benefit from these in any way.  Watching this launch is like going to watch a rich person board their yacht. Sure. super-yachts are cool, but completely irrelevant to anything in my life.
Knowing now the self destruct mode works is so gratifying, beautiful. fantastic, awesome…….I’m so amazed it leaves me speechless! 🤔
💯🤍 HANDSOME👨🏻‍🦰🔥✨💪🏻❤️
That was SO cool! Amazing innovations being done over there. Thank you for the great overview and explanations!
I don’t know what happened, but yesterday watching this live I started to cry uncontrolably. Now mind you Im a pretty big fella but that had me weak. I felt so proud for all of mankind that we managed to get so far. SpaceX is breaking boundaries and sooner or later everything will run smoothly. Just incredible
Nice
Elon “liar” Musk. The greatest ever snake oil salesman.
Scott Manley had a good take on the telemetry - at hot staging the booster appeared to be accelerated backwards by the second stage engines which would have caused propellant sloshing, probably damaging the engines, and late into second stage flight shortly before RUD the liquid oxygen suddenly went down a lot faster than the methane.
To everyone saying that the launch yesterday was a failure they have to realize that even at this stage of development and as a expendable system Starship super heavy booster made SLS system obsolete in half the time and half the development cost with a higher rate of production and less cost per unit.  😱🤯🤯🤯🤯😱
Thank you for the video of a great launch. One of those , "A small step for man ,a giant leap for mankind" moment.  My thoughts on the first launch was the engines that failed were due to the debris being thrown up back into them. A great job on the repairs. I think a spring release or an explosive release should be added as that perforated ring may be backing up the ignition to the supply side of the engines and causing  who knows what. 👌😎👍
Here is a question for the comunity. the shot from the drone t+13 to t+20 Why does the exaust plume look to fuel rich? Isnt there to much soot coming from the plume for a full stage combustion chamber rocket engine?
Explosions in space are quite spectacular.
I can see the problem:  Right at separation the booster was going too slowly and when Starship pushed off, the boosters fuel would have sloshed all the way back up to the to of the tank, you can see the major negative acceleration. The engines ran for a bit more maybe from the header tank but I bet it runs out of fuel quickly.
A great analysis Mr House thanks
Amazing overview. Thank you!
My theory is that at the flip of the booster, the liquid fuel wasn't completely at the bottom of the tank. That is why the engines failed. I am curious what the result will be.
Thank you  for you and your teams work.  I waited to watch your recap to get the best of all information.  What a big win for SpaceX and for all of us as well.  I feel like we are cresting the mountain top (similar to the story of the Falcon 9's) and beginning to see what the downhill descent might look like in the coming year.  Cheers
About to break 500k Marcus congratulations.
Fantastic coverage as always,  Marcus!
SpaceX really needs to redesign the launch pad.  The initial flames and exhaust from the Raptor engines needs to be controlled like they do it in Florida.  The redesign needs to include exhaust weirs to direct the flames from the initial ignition down and away from the vehicle and the launch tower.    SERIOUSLY, they do!
So.....another fail.
Cool overview, thanks Marcus ! At 9:25, it seems likely to me that the shock of hot-stage separation caused a short, sharp negative acceleration on the booster, which may have caused the propellent to unsettle from the bottom of the tank, and fuel lines breathing vapor for a second, and that could cause the engine failure of the booster engines seconds after separation. Maybe they should keep the booster engines running through separation, so that no negative acceleration of the booster fuel tanks would happen.... What do you guys think caused the booster engines to fail at 9:50 ?
Thanks for a great overview, nice to see it all from a calm analytical perspective.
MISSION: Firmament.... 😲😯😮
33rd degree. X is Osirus.
Awesome Video!!! I am still feeling the excitement today!
Thanks for this awesome summary of such an incredible event, Marcus. I did manage to see a short clip of the launch after the livestream but didn't get to see the actual stream.  Thanks again.
I would love to better understand what happened to Starship at T+07:07, and then again at T+07:40, and then something else at T+08:05. There are several events visible in the plume, which all seem like they might have a relation to the eventual flight termination at T+08:08…. I haven’t seen anyone explain those yet.
Great show! Thanks Marcus!
Hope you young Musk incel bros appreciate what Apollo did.  Man on the moon!!!!
Why did You Tube not carry the launch…. Thanks for great report..
"booster 25"
Here we have the billionaires of the country wasting large amounts of resources time and money trying to play sci-fi. Why are we trying to colonize a dead rock with no magnetic field to keep a breathable atmosphere? Not to mention the real truth is the human body simply can't exist long term in outer space, it's just not possible. We are the greatest form of humanity that has ever existed supposably, but we can't even find housing for 1000 homeless people in any American city, we would rather play space, tone def you think? This space race does nothing for humanity it's just nerdy big dick flexing. the cost of one rocket launch could help thousands live a normal life and get back on their feet, its especially hurtful when your homeless because people with big tech income, AirBnb have priced you out or snatch up all of the housing, not everyone has a disposable $10k income a month, not everyone is homeless because of drugs.
The hot-staging itself, looked like a beautiful nebula.
Just show a caveman fire........
Thanks, Marcus. I suspect that Space X will begin R&D on Lunar Starship in a year or 2. NASA will probably be relieved when they see that.
In case y'all didn't notice, two times in a row, hundreds of millions of dollars blew up. It's astonishing how you people can continue to try to gaslight people and convince them what they are seeing isn't real. The rocket is now in pieces. It exploded. It failed. Y'all prove PT Barnum's assertion that there is a sucker born every minute. How many children , here on earth could have been fed, wells drilled, home found for the homeless, young people educated in science?  And in a year , ANOTHER rocket will blow up. How about focusing on children who die every fkng day, instead of this pie in the sky notion of people living on Mars. It ain't gonna happen.
Absolutely amazing. The exhaust makes a nice 6-pointed pattern through the launch platform's stilts. All of the engines burning. And then the gigantic explosion, considering how big the booster itself is. This was a failed launch, but a hugely successful experiment! Investments secured.
:)
😂😂😂 still believe these lies,y'all dumb
RUD..lol..guessing it won't hurt someone's feelings.... TURD - Total Unexpected  Rapid Disassembly..lol
the most beautiful part about the launch, in my opinion, was how the exhaust plumes combined into one massive single plume, and you could see the mach diamonds in it with perfect clarity
Wow. Incredible!
I noticed during the Space X prelaunch commentary that ship was expected to coast between 150 and 250 KM, (6:35 on X feed) in reality Ships engines cut 148 KM at 24,120 KM/H with low fuel, about 4,000 km per hour short of orbital speed This makes me wonder about boil off and fuel consumption issues moving forward. I'm sure booster efficiencies will continue to improve this and will certainly be interesting to see in future launches.
Excellent video!!!
6 , PLUMES OF EXHAUST FROM LAUNCH ?   FREEMASON -33 RAPTOR ENGINES ON BOOSTER ROCKET ? 6 RAPTER ROCKETS ON STAR SHIP ?
1:28 Marcus revealing setup of future booster . Heard it here first
Fantastic to see progress, the guy talking to Elon in the white hat had the best weekend, he was on the Las Vegas F1 grid as well
The booster explosion was breath taking
the sound waves after ignition looks so cool
Marcus, the best video and commentary
Could they get away with shutdown less engine and perforform a slower turn back? Gotta fix the ship's oxygen leak.
To read the mainstream media you would not believe they are reporting on the same event. So many people are being led to believe this launch was a disaster. Partial and misleading opinion passed off as fact is nothing more than rating grabbing nonsense.
Excellent recap, thank you!
Does anyone know if there is a VOD of spacex's livestream and where I can find it?
Really appreciate the post-flight analysis you and others provide, Marcus. It helps my understanding so much.  Or maybe I should believe the "hit the firmament" posts I see on my X timeline instead!
3rd times a charm?
Those shockwaves around the base of the pad were insane, and that plume length is outrageous!!
Great report, just clean and great!!!!
We should all raise a glass to the Crain operators and sling men. they don’t get enough credit for moving these massive things around safely and rapidly!! having a good team on the cranes is why this launch still happened in the launch window. … no. I am not a crane operator.
Excellent. Is the debris seen at 11:30 of Starship, Columbia, an unrelated AI rendering, or something else?
Best brief ever Marcus, your awesome. The best part is no part. Same in your reporting, to the point with minimal words spoken. Thank you!
Not that it matters but, how much did it cost
Hey hey Marcus. Great coverage thank you. Wasn't that a beautiful lift off! After separation it looked to be to be a fuel starvation issue for the booster. Too much slosh maybe and I wonder if the vehicle is not able to maintain acceleration in the direction required to keep the fuel at the tank take off lines? It's hard to imagine as that big tank does its flip, but the Falcon manages it somehow. AND what about that sooty exhaust plume! Where does that come from?
I don't understand what is different here from the launch of Russian and American rockets from ten years ago?
Excellent reporting!
no chance would i fly to space in that giant dead end, instead of wasting billions  on this thing space x should invest all the money into reaction engines who have already cracked the main hold up for space plance that being the precooler that stops the engines from melting at mach 20 so with spacex money we could have fleet of space planes taking of from normal runways and having a turn around time not much more than a airliner so please bin this old rocket tech and put the funds into the future of space flight
Major improvements compared to the first flight test space x getting closer to their first official flight job well done 👏
I wonder if the rocket explosion can damage the ozone layer or something
The amount of fire and brimstone here is just craaazy when you think of the scale of things.
Scott Manley had a good explanation of why the boosted failed. Of course he doesn't know what Spacex will report in the coming days.
this literally proved we inna firmament
Thank you, Marcus (and the others with whom you regularly collaborate). This was an excellent and informative segment of your series. I'm glad that the damage to "Stage Zero" looked fairly superficial, as fixing the damage to the pad and tower too, a long time.   The unwanted dénouement of this flight aside, it does seem as if SpaceX are on the right track. Still, it was disappointing that the launch did not allow SpaceX to see how the booster managed the boost-back to Earth (as you and your mates well know, this is absolutely crucial to SpaceX's plans for the system). It would also have been nice to see how the Starship itself would do in a "real" re-entry (even though so many tiles were missing, the spacecraft is made of stainless steel, which has a much higher tolerance for heat than aluminum, so it may well have survived--had it not blown up).   I hope the next two Starship/booster stacks can be modified in light of whatever findings come from an anlysis of this latest failure.
It is a shame that such a crazy racist man is in charge of an amazing company
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Excellent explanations of every aspect.
Are there baffles and such inside those tanks to prevent/ reduce fluid 'slosh'? Even the mop bucket we use at work has one. C'mon, SpaceX....
From the look of the engine failures, maybe it was due to sloshing from the boost back maneuver as they all seemed to fail at the same time.
Musk has been struggling getting this off the ground and then congressional hearings suggest nonhuman origin space crafts - i hope uap believers pause for a second and ask themselves if the richest man on earth can't get his flagship rocket off the ground, clearly he doesn't know any fancy ways other than the business as usual brute force - how on earth can you believe whistle-blowers from the us government!!
9:20 I don't know if there was a delay between the GUI display and the footage.  I think the light gray indicates the engines are spinning up for initial ignition.  IIRC there's a white color indicating full ignition.
That baby blowed up real good! Third time's the charm. Flight 3, it's Hawaii or bust!
At 5:40 it sounds like loads of people dying screaming. It reminds me of the last transmission of the Event Horizon starship.
Booster bumped ship 25, immediately after seperation. You can literally see it happen
Epic! Surely there must have been some uncalculated forces that caused issues on the booster to not function correctly after the hot stage. More curious abouth the starship as everthing seemed to be running fine there? Maybe the course trajectory was off at this point and so they needed to terminate early?
Great review Marcus, thank you mate!
What happened to the starship ? Lost or exploded?
awesome recap, thx!
IDK what's taking so long. I could build this in KSP2 with a month of down time.
Excellent program. Thanks.
Awesome summary, thank you!
But at what costs, please discuss the 600 plus unreported injuries, some grievous, at SpaceX facilities.
Nice presentation - and you are oh so close to the 500K subscriber mark!
Great overview
Glad the pad held up. Hopefully it will only be a month or two before launch three
Thanks!
Still following the same success at launch as the Russian N1 Moon rocket. Let's never forget that fact
The rocket is so powerful you can literally SEE the sound it produces
Great video, you added to what I had seen already.
So exciting thanks for the coverage Marcus
What's all that white gas coming off the rocket during the fuel loading?
Where do you put the batteries?
I welded tubes that go in the starship. I work for veridiam and our manafacturing plant is the only company that fo what we do
33 Engines… wow the Freemasons are so disgustingly pathetic and obvious nowadays… clearly these idiots can’t escape our closed system. The amount of taxpayer money they’re stealing to burn off is beyond a joke 🤦‍♂️
I am happy that I missed the first launch now. This is what that one should have been.  Thanks for your very informative and ever enthusiastic content. You have the same energy as these really annoyingly loud and in your face content creators, that seem to plague youtube, but you deliver it so much more smoothly. Like a Single Malt compared to a Hillbilly Homebrew
Thanks! You do great work!
From a layman´s perspective: I always thought it would be simpler to develop and certify the starship as a "space" ship only, using its cargo capacity but faring crew to and from  via Crew dragon while it stays in orbit... But maybe that´s why I´m a layman, not a spaceX engineer
It was a fully impressive launch! The candle turned out to be two sticks of dynamite... I expect the third to do an orbit or two. I walked the door at T-11 so I immediately jumped on... any feed I could find (with sky news showing an alternative view (from left and right)) and watched.
Have we lost interest? I didn't hear of it till after, and only this video
One step closer❤ to
What a shit show.
Someone please help me understand why there seems like dark smoke on my he left at 6:02 ?
was this a 100k subscriber video? I swear you were at almost 400k yesterday. Keep up the great work!
Thanks for the summary now. I was also looking for your livestream show, but could not find it. Did you missed the event? Please report on the livestreams too, the other channels I could find had boring or poor reports... Like your work a lot! 👍
Nasa like 60 years ago: "Failure is not an option" SpaceX like every flight: "💥💥💥💥💥 :))))))) 👏👏👏👏"
Yes it is a quite day . today Sunday . because we are still not going to Mars the red planet . space X failed . yes second time .
Well done, Marcus.  This video was great.
Was this the reason for all those Explosion Sounds and Vibrations in the Caribbean????
One of MTG's special space lasers perhaps?
This was exciting to watch in real time: all 33 Raptor engines burning.  Scott Manley suggests that water hammer during deceleration may have ruptured fuel lines, and there were streams of venting gas plumes emitting from the base of the booster after the flip. They actually looked like jets of gas to be honest, very straight lines. There was also puffs of orange gas during the hot stage; I wonder what got burned up there?
I am a huge SpaceX fan but this launch leaves me with a hollow feeling, like wt, maybe I I expected too much!
Yo wtf you can actually see hit something then it stops and blows up anyone with common sense can see it hit and invisible barrier
this was amazin ! history in the making....
Well since there was a Rud I hope it doesn't take the FAA another 7 months to figure this out
where can I get a T shirt like you have on?
Congrats on 500K Marcus!
By far, the best analysis
I was lucky enough to watch it live, and man, was that exciting!!!!Regardless of the outcome, this was a huge success for SpaceX.   Thanks Marcus for the in-depth analysis, brilliant as always.
It terminated because it wasn't going to land where it was suppose to?
It ran out of fuel and it wasn't even under load.. how many starships to fill up 1 starship in space. They will need something diffrent to travel between the moon and earth. Most likey nuclear powered..
Thanks for providing me with all the beautiful shots that I missed as I started watching just minutes before the launch...
Outstanding analysis of the launch Marcus. Thank you very much!
My daughter (8 years old) specifically wanted to be woken up in time to watch the launch. I think SpaceX is igniting a new space age wonder in the young people. We could actually go back to space to live instead of just visit in their lifetimes. Much more exciting, similar to the Apollo program than the shuttle program I grew up under.
Hi Marcus, Terrific video and commentary! Thanks so much for all of your hard work getting this together in such a short period of time. I always follow your channel to find out the best and most complete details of these events. SpaceX did come up on YouTube at approximately 20 minutes prior to the event. I was disappointed in them for not doing a commentary about this launch. They only came on long enough to show that the hot staging worked but didn't do any type of follow-up on Starship after the booster exploded. I am so glad that there are people like you and your team who get the most complete information out to us who are dedicating to SpaceX and these launches plus all other current  space program information. YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE THE BEST!
Building rockets is so difficult that they can’t even figure out how to keep the heat tiles attached :(
USA SPACE FORCE published its motto in 2018. "DEPLOYING MILITARY FORCE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IN 30 MINUTES"!!! It is interesting, is not it. STARSHIP is a military project. It is being prepared to launch not one but 7-8 launches in a short time, so there are many like this. For this reason, that huge land was taken and many hangars were built. Bouncing off the atmosphere, dropping the drones and returning to base. By the way, what will happen to those spills? Unmanned, kamikaze, drones etc. : ) Their communication will be provided with STARLINK. So STARLING is also a USD SPACE FORCE project. ELON MUSK? He is the greatest WEAPON BARON the world has ever known. Neither Mars nor the Internet nor space... You will almost have tears in your eyes from happiness...
Subscribed, thanks for the info.
Great vid!  Go SpaceX
Very expensive fireworks!
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Thanks for the breakdown Marcus. Brilliant as always! Absolutely historic stuff we're seeing here...
Thank you for the prelaunch shots and video.  That was truly impressive!  And it seems as if Space X is figuring this thing out much faster than the Falcon rockets.  Although, they still haven’t achieved orbit yet.  The hot staging seemed as if they need to keep more than just the three Raptor engines lit.  The sudden drop in speed when they lit the Starship off of the booster may have caused the fuel to displace in addition to the maneuver, the engines on the inside of the maneuver were the ones to fail first.  I’m certain that they will figure this out.  But, woe was that amazing to watch!
I would like to know how far down range did Starship make it.
I have to say, right from liftoff, it looked like something was wrong.  It leaned over and started sliding sideways and for quite a while it looked like it was just struggling to keep its orientation and accelerate in the desired direction.  I'm pretty sure they intentionally blew the second stage because it couldn't make it to an acceptable trajectory.  I could be wrong but usually you can tell when something is off with how a rocket should be working.  It may be a new rocket but it's still a rocket.  I also wish people would use km/s instead of km/h.  It's a much more useful unit of measurement for orbital speeds.
Still the failure of both booster and ship it self may be little bit worrying.
This was absolutely brilliant it will be interesting to see why the termination systems  cut in
Thank you, Marcus. You NEVER disappoint. You can chalk this one up as another in the win column!
The one thing you missed, Marcus, was the astronomy YouTube guy that managed to get Starship on video filming from the Florida Keys!  But it turned out to only be the nose cone section of Starship, presumably meaning the Starship FTS basically broke the vehicle in half.  In his video that was livestreamed last night, you can see the nose flaps and the whole piece spinning as it tumbles through the sky.  Crazy that someone got that on video...
Wow what a great launch. The data that space x received from the vehicles must have been massive. I would say if the next launch goes as good as this one the starship will make orbit
That was a fabulous presentation, both comments and the beautiful video snips that you use.  I rarely give 👍🏼 but I gave you one, plus a comment! Not quite to subscribe territory yet, but under consideration 😉.
Thank you, for an understandable overview of SpaceX Starship Launch 2. i fully agree with you that it should be viewed as a success. So many things went correctly and smoothly! Obviously, Starship is still at a significant distance from the understanding and success of Falcon 9. Mainly due, as it seems to me, because of the very different weight and size factors. It should be a very similar physical problem compared to Falcon 9, but obviously the margins within which stable flight is possible are hugely different. Amazing science and engineering, and exciting times for all those involved.
Little bit dissapointed they don't know what happened to the payload yet. I guess they were focusing on Stage 1 and the launch pad. Also, hexagonal tiles seem like a nightmare, can't they just coat that thing with delayed expanding foam or something?
Good job
And to think it’s taken SpaceX all these years to get to this stage of testing whereas Blue Origin still hasn’t flown or tested a single New Glenn rocket !!
Thank you Marcus! 🤘👊
This flight has eased some of my concerns about Starship, and it looks like SpaceX has been working to constantly make each launch and flight better.
next flight will be prefect. Can't wait.
Zero onboard coverage this time! I'd give a testicle to see some of those cameras, especially at hot-staging!
Thank you Marcus!! excellent video ---great up todate analysis---all the new channels gave useless information about what happened!
My money is on IFT-4
Awesome!
Does anybody know why the "Orbital Flight Test" is abbreviated as "IFT"?  My guess would be "Integrated FT", but I'm open to other, perhaps more creative suggestions...  ;-)
Thank you Marcus.  I knew you would explan what happened.  Amazing job as always.   You're explaining all of this without a script????! GEZZZZ   Thank you again
I would like to hear the rocket not the employees.
Wonderful breakdown of events as usual! This test was awe inspiring to watch and just feeds my hype for the next one. The sight of those 33 engines glowing as they push this huge stainless steel monster into the sky was pure scifi imagery.
I mean very good step from where we were from last flight. I think with the advancement of tesla's "dojo" AI and other AI they have cooking. I have no doubt there will be a successful launch within next year
The tiles have been an issue from the start, and I think they might need to do a rework/overhaul of that mounting system. The stresses seem to be too much for whatever system they have now.
Biggest the explosion, bigger the success is?
Why is there no official SpaceX feed of this?
Truly an amazing feat! Just think the only other rocket(N1) that's comparable to this tried 4 times and failed.
Marcus  H O U S E !
The fact that all those engines are so close together makes it over heat.
I'd LOVE to see Slo Mo Guys do a slo mo of the super heavy launch. The shockwave released when the engines started up was absolutely amazing. I'd love to hear the sound difference at distance, etc.
Terrific brake-down of the details in the 2nd launch Marcus 😀That lack of obvious damage to the launch pad area should allow the 3rd launch date to be not too distinct, once the starship and booster problems have been analysed and addressed...
Thanks for the fast turnaround on this out. Lots of great info here and got to enjoy breakfast with Marcus afterall.
Anyone who called this launch a failure is a dick. Looking at you *Scott Manley*.
Outstanding! My curiosity is satisfied.
SpaceX needs to go get those raptors. If they dont bet your butt Russia & China will RUD or no RUD.
It blew up! Again!
SWEET
I have great confidence in SpaceX ironing out the flip manoeuvre problems for booster.
The speed of the thing was the most impressive. It reached max Q within a blink of an eye
no one wanna fly this thing 😐
The speed of the thing was the most impressive. It reached max Q within a blink of an eye
Wow. Great breakdown!
Great video Marcus 👍👍👍
Heck , I’ll ride this thing
Excellent stuff bro
Based on traditional NASA standards the booster functioned perfectly. The NASA standard is to throw the booster away anyway.
Thank you Marcus!  Awesome as usual
It's mad to me how in the second ever flight of this thing they have a manged to get it that far. Its a shame after separation it never continued on for much longer but its unreal how close they are getting to this thing properly flying. Its great having a billionaire actually spending money on stuff that will help us. Hopefully figure out a few things and next attempt get it going properly.
Spacex has never turned a profit, and has never paid a dividend. Maybe instead of WASTING your money on some guy with half a fucking brain cell pretending he's God damn iron man, if we had just given NASA a quarter of the money we dumped into spaceX, the SLS would have already been built and we'd already be on the moon.
its was great flight I sure SpaceX learned alot for the next flight.
This was one of the best post launch assessments on the web.  Great job focusing on Stage 0, the key to a third lunch attempt.
Great summary. Let’s hope the FAA does not get in the way of the next launch.
Thank you, Mr House.
An excellent summary of what happened. Thank you.
I thought it blew up!!!
*Wake up from your pathetic Musk cult*
Is there such a thing as a *normal-speed planned* disassembly where the vehicle ends up in the same condition? No? Then you should say it exploded. Because it did.
Absolutely breathtaking and awe-inspiring.
3rd times a charm
Congratulations on winning the Cricket world cup 😋
Well, to recap : a fuel shortage in the starship?
Move your camera - looking up your nose is sh!tty mate
1:28 "booster 25" ;D
Excellent review!  Congrats to SpaceX!
Incredible they even attempt space considering we live in a CLOSED system
I did see one large peice of debry from one angle, I think it was just a metal sheet from one of the stand legs.
What’s the condition of the PAD? We all know they are trying to make a reusable rocket, but so far the pad has been a single use pad with each serious test firing and launch requiring massive amounts of repair, refurbishment, and alteration.   I want to see clear shots of the shower head and what damage it sustained.   I assume they will have to repaint the entire pad again.   I saw innumerable constructive shockwaves in the exhaust around the pad, extending all the way to the tank farm.  At least they weren’t reflecting straight back up the stack like the first launch, but I do want to see if the shower head held up to the pounding.
Thanks!
Were there any on board shots of the flight test?
Thank you for the detailed analysis. I noted that it lingered about 7 seconds at full thrust on the OLM before lift off, 5 seconds less than the 12 seconds of first flight.
It's interesting to note that some news organizations framed this as a failure, shows a profound misunderstanding of the process at SpaceX and possibly an attempt to paint Musk in a negative light.
When even thunderf00t praises it.
Plot twist:this was all so Elon could show us a great visualization of the speed of sound.
The hot stage ring was likely over torqued at launch due to a lack of a proper launch shock load thrust diverter.  Thus the hot fire ring being damaged at launch may have damaged the StarShip plumbing, tanks etc. so when the StarShip upper stage engines fired it went boom, a big boom 💥.
Great video Marcus - you do a very nice job!
Think about the first stage in a non-reusable form.  They've now proven that it works.  Take off the fins and no reserve fuel.  That thing cand put a huge load into any orbit or any where in the solar system!  And there was that generals wet dream of using it for whatever in a suborbital deployment, and the Pentagon doesn't much care about cost or reuse.
all the people claiming the raptors are still unreliable just show how little they bothered to think about how rockets work ( and fail)
O sistema de dilúvio da base de lançamento ficou muito bonito e funcionou! Meus sinceros parabéns a equipe!
Booster 25 :D
Good progress on launch mount, engine reliability, electrical gimbal guidance. Hot staging probably worked but because the booster exploded so quickly after staging, damage cannot be ruled out (Hot Staging is probably good to go). Scott Manley’s video showed the booster’s engine not lighting or staying lit for boost back and this is concerning because it looks like a fuel feed problem. Almost certainly that requires a hardware engineering fix which will take time to design, test in simulation, approve, build, install and test in place (difficult to test). They may even need a dedicated booster test article (which may be pretty fast). Starship RUD is probably a structural issue based on a leaking lox tank (this conclusion is entirely based on the way the lox quantity remaining suddenly declined and may be a bad take on the data). In any case, I doubt that the Starship issue is a software fix. The last thing that has lingered for 2 years is that heat shield tiles fall off. That’s got to be fixed before the re-entry can be tested out. I doubt it will impact flight 3, but it has to be rectified. Based on the above, I would guess 4-6 months until next flight. I estimated at least 6 months after first flight and was pretty close at 6.9 months between flights. Overall, this was a good flight test with many test points accomplished. As is usual, new deficiencies are now apparent. I don’t think that a fully successful profile is possible until end of 2024 because re-entry and landing for both vehicles is  still ahead,
Nice recap, mate.
LOX usage on second stage Starship increased a lot just before the boom if you watch the fuel gauge sliders.  Great video as always Marcus!
Love it, thanks for the detailed debrief
Do you think we are going to get any on-board camera footage from this flight?
Hey Marcus, Nice to see you participating in at least NASASpaceFlight's stream last night. Nice breakdown, but did you notice at the 7 minute mark there was a somewhat abnormally large ploom that was suddenly visible from the ship. This seemed to co-incide with the LOX fuel gauge animation dropping faster than it had been. It was always just above the CH4 level, but as soon as that ploom was visible at the 7 minute mark it dropped faster to the point where it was basically empty. This could lead to a theory that either the engines shut down 30 seconds early as they run out of oxidiser, or they chewed themselves apart because they run out of oxidiser. Both scenarios leading the ship to determine it could no longer make its target trajectory and to initiate the FTS rather than start reentry approaching or over Africa.  Scott Manley did an analysis video on this which raises some interesting points.  I guess we will find out when SpaceX or any authority chooses to release further details to the pubic (if that happens).  I saw RGV's stream earlier today, nice to see the steel plate appeared to survive well, but I am sure they will need to do a reasonable amount of refurbishment and cleaning before anything can go again.
hot staging, shouldn't have been and surely wasn't a problem, because of the fact that it was successfully managed, even by soviets!
It’s very nice to see the various SpaceX YouTubers working together for events like this. The sense of community is amazing!
the tiles seem to be an issue ... vibration at launch ?  Could the tiles be covered with an ablative ply?  It would be nice to know that SpaceX have the installation values (they must test the bond somehow, like Shuttle) for the tiles that failed ?  Maybe they were at the low end of acceptable tolerance ?    Thx for explaining the Methane boil-off recovery.  Obviously you wouldn't vent methane to atmosphere.  Hey, something different ... from NASA launches you see "sparklers" light up under the exhaust nozzles just prior to launch (to ensure fuel doesn't collect under the rocket).  But (obviously) not so for SpaceX.  Thoughts ?
In space flight every thing has to go correctly and no it was not a successful flight as it failed on so many levels. Falcon is a totally different bird in so many ways than Starship so if one simpler craft is successful doesn't mean they have the capability to up the level.  I have alway said that the mission set NASA wants for the moon should have gone to a major aviation/defence contractor like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Northrop Grumman as they have shown repeatedly they have the experience and design infrastructure to succeed. Wishing Starship well in the next launch, as the next flight needs to be successful.......... the pressure is on or NASA might have to look elsewhere.
Too bad it was a failure.
Falaram que entrou para o livro dos recordes como o maior maçarico já produzido pelo homem! Vai vendo!
Love it bro
Excellent work to produce this very informative video so quickly. Thank you.
O momento é de pensar mais e fazer menos!
Porquê não utilizar dois foguetes sólidos e asa delta cheia de querosene RPG! A atmosfera funciona como um freio aqui na Terra como em Marte! Pensar em refrigeração dos motores também é muito bom assim como contrapressão e ondas de choque!
A beautiful launch. That is one big rocket!!
Thanks Elon/Space X, your amazing! Keep going please.
I don’t see how this thing could land on Mars or the moon
Beautiful successful part of the assent.  Congratulations!  Getting back to solving for X;  things that need looking into.  Hot ring deflector shield effectiveness; effect of centrifugal force on remaining fuel, and fuel pumps ability to get fuel to the engines;  the spaceship speed may have changed (slowed down, or sped up) to cause fuel starvation due to lost inertia, or excess inertia effecting significant inertial mass change of fuel.
You can tell it’s real because it looks so fake
Assume flight, keep up the great work guys
Dear Marcus,  Thank you so much for this beautiful explanation. Always so happy and content to watch your videos!!:) Cheers Ivan
Best coverage in the world !!!  Thank you.
I miss your "Hey, Hey" that you used to start your videos with. LOL
John Insprucker did say in the launch livestream that they replaced one actuator that needed it along with two just to be safe
What a great day in history. And the best channel of u tube.
Big badaboom😊
Great video!
So close to 500K.  Sorry about this Marcus ....my homie, house mate man, but any chance of a Ned Flanders inspired intro like Hi-dilly-ho, neighborinos.    How about a; Hey-diddly-hey, Space-sorinos!
I dont watch these anymore. I cannot stand the wooping and cheering over the sound of the engine. It spoils my experience completely.  Its like cheering over the sound of The Flying Scotsman - why would you do that?  Please, and i know im not alone, provide a stream without purposely overlaying audio from the offices. I want to watch these, but i will continue to avoid them - its such a shame for my enthusiasm in space travel.
It looked like a cascade of failing engines on the first stage lead to the termination event by the self destruct system. Not sure why the first stage self destructed but it may have been premature as it seemed everything was nominal. Wondering why there were no external or engine bay video feeds on this launch.
Worlds most expensive firework mk2. 🤦‍♂️😂
Well I was wrong. 😂 FTS did not malfunction.  Very cool.😊
I think they just flipped the booster too soon - let ship move a bit further away next time to reduce any chance of the ship's exhaust causing the booster to flip too quickly and have fuel slushing around. I  am sure the next test we will at least see the booster flip and make it's boostback burn successfully.
A very successful test! I'm looking forward to the explanation for why the orbiter failed.
Maybe next time.
Sunday AM EST, Indiana,USA. Thanks Marcus to you and your team down there for getting this Vid out.
Launched like a fire breathing dragon with all engines in full thrust
If you notice that at the eight minute mark when the engines shut off. Starship ran out of propellant that’s when they self destructed.
SpaceX: - Proves the water deluge is feasible to protect the launch infrastructure                 - Launches the most powerful rocket safely and clearing the tower                 - All 33 engines on the booster and all 6 engines on ship ignited successfully                 - Hot-stage ring survived and hot-stage maneuver done flawlessly                  - Booster's FTS worked perfectly in terminating the flight                 - Booster's 33 engines fired for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, Ship's 6 engines fired for more than 5 minutes                 - Ship was seconds away from achieving the desired velocity and reached 148 km in altitude                 - Ship's FTS safely destroyed the vehicle  Viewers: Speechless and mesmerized   Media: "Musk's rocket explodes again"  SpaceX: That was cool! We'll learn, improve and do it again soon!
Is that the destination F guy?  If it is he needs more emphasis in his dialog. 😂😂
Is it bigger then a Saturn V?
I have a feeling the hot staging is what caused the booster to explode. We've seen how destructive those raptor engines can be.
Fantastic flight! Excellent video. ❤👍🏾
Just ❤
At 12:00 that image would look so awesome on a hoodie, t-shirt, pullover, back of a leather jacket etc.
It's still a disgrace....to Elon and everybody who "believes" they told us the truth about the Apollo program .... all the idiot employees cheering as shit blows up...the world is laughing
I strongly disagree with saying that the explosion is unexpected when someone is pushing a button to cause the explosion. This feels like politics to me. Elon says that he wants explosions called Rapid Unexpected Disassembly events and so that is what they call them whether or not it's actually a true statement.
40 engines was lost and everybody talking about great success .... fanboys will be fanboys.
It blew up again. Twice.
Made a grown man shed tears. Real strange. Unexpected and like getting hit with a hammer.  Only other time I can think of was the birth of my daughter's that I've had that particular feeling.
No, the distance isn't really that surprising.  At separation, around 5:30, the Stack flew at "only" 5600 kph. The upper stage gained (thanks to losing the now useless weight of the booster with its almost empty tanks) 24124 kph by 8:07, but that means that for 6 or 7 minutes the speed was below 10k and the last minute made up most of the gain in velocity.  If we ignore the acceleration profile and go directly for the end speed that is like 6.7 kps, meaning after 8:07 it would be around 3100 kilmeters from Brownsville. the farther coast of Puerto Rico is roughly 2500 km away... in the end a distance of 2,000 - 2,200 km and then slowly losing its speed and altitude over the next 100, 200 or so km and topple back to Earth seems the most realistic.
They want to put how many people on these things?
I think the main thing that went wrong was Hot Staging. Musk said the hot Staging Ring may be too small, looks like he was right. Probably the Starship was damaged by engine exhaust at separation because the Hot Staging Ring wasn't large enough. The Booster RUD was probably because it needed more thus at Hot Staging to keep the propellant at the bottom of the tanks...If so this is what the test was about they can now tweak the design and procedures for next time. I predict just like they fixed the issues with the pad after the first launch next time they'll nail Hot Staging.
Who picks up all the debris? Or does burn up? Info please?
Thanks! Really good review, much appreciated
Thanks!
I hate how these monumental leaps in technology (and our species’ survival chance) happen and the headlines are “it crashed”, “it failed”, “it exploded”.   I doubt they need to be told again, but anyone who worked on this should be incredibly proud
watching that thing take off is just fuckin insane  go humanity!
The engine shutdown sequence before hot staging was SO FREAKIN COOL! I'm glad you pointed that out, it seems so many channels are glossing over that. Thanks for the awesome coverage Marcus!
people who call this launch a failure dont realize that  a space program is nothing without explosions
Those heat shield tiles!
What happened to Booster 9 seems obvious to me. If you leave 3 raptors working at 50 percent you only have 3,600 kN of thrust. If you then ignite 6 raptors on Ship 26 producing 14,400 kN of thrust pushing against Booster 9 you get a rapid deceleration of Booster 9 as a resultbof Newtons second law.The fuel and LOX inside the tanks  however keeps moving forward, you know, the law of conservation of momentum. In my opinion the raptors on Booster 9 couldn't be ignited because they were starved from fuel and LOX.
Very well done! Thanks for the excellent pad veiws! I was worried but I think that may be generally in working order with a little work. Do you and your crew ever sleep?  Thanks Marcus!!
I was screaming 33 all the way up!😂
I believe that this round of investigation for FAA will not drag out as long as IFT 1 did. The engines preforming miles ahead better this time compared to before, hot stage of, pad survivability and FTS preforming when triggered, I predict that ship 28 and its associated boater that we could see another flight by February 24. That’s my prediction
If you look at 6:20 to 6:23 you can see the bottom half of Starship lost some tiles. It looks like one area lost several, but its hard to see enough detail to say how many, or if it was enough to cause problems. All 6 engines shut of simultaneously, so Starship was either a RUD victim or intentionally destroyed. I vote RUD. I vote RUD due to the loss of many tiles. The point at which comms was lost was right about the time Starship would have begun experiencing a lot of stress to emulate reentry. Opinions?
The engineering and everything that led up to this lunch going as well as it did, is amazing!   The size,width & power, Thrusting its way, preparing to penetrate or atmosphere with no disregards! Only to be met with premature ej.. explosion!    At least the future humanity has at least one thing going for it!
Haha y’all some dummies.  Fake x is deceiving you sheeples
one step by the other
Nice video. Witch Your amazing radio voice 5X subscribers would be realistic , maybe more general content. Showing the ones face , will destroy the absolute harm of voice, so that would be nono at future
I mean this is our first interplanetary capable spaceship, can only imagine what itll be like in 5 years i mean look at falcon 9...took em four attempts... and thats just a normal payload but starship...thats something to be excited about
The FAA got hacked by china and they forced flight termination systems on lol
Love the model starship in the background which brings the question has spaceX ever launched a scaled down version of the Starship? I’m asking cause back in the day during the space race the USSR had too many rocket engines and what NASA did was make them 3 large engines so in this case, has spacex perfected the more than 3 rocket engine design and was this used in a scaled down version at all or was it just all math and modern tech.
The last 2 blew up.  Musk said we'd be sending people to Mars this year.  Looks like the habitual liar lied again.
Can't wait for IFT3!!!!
Elon is runing everything.  Shut up Elon.
The visibility was Zero I can't believe they actually launched
They should have three extra staggered rows of boosters that only engage to compensate when others don’t engage correctly or fail to ensure proper performance and safeguard their rockets safe flight and return
I wonder if the hot stage ring could be longer to dissipate more of the back pressure from the ship.
I'm calling that a success. Yes both booster and Starship didn't make it to the end of their scheduled paths, but the improvements from the first launch just out weighs everything. The amount of data gathered is invaluable!
The question is, why are they still working with the rockets? I mean, give me a break. I know they got better Technology than that. I mean, wake up people.
Awesome as always!
Beautiful! Progress at last!
This test was a complete success
That was a huge step.
Wow my sister bday is going down in history. 🎉 Question when the motors are being gambled in the last few seconds is that SpaceX manually doing that or..ai?🤔
Starship is unsafe for human travel.   Lift off may be obtainable, but landing is deadly.
Looking at the photo at 0:39, I now wonder if the hot staging might have damaged one or more grid fin actuators and caused the booster instability after separation.
It looks like as the booster flip starts the fuel/oxidiser is not staying in the bottom of the tanks leading to engines getting starved of liquid fuel/oxidiser and all the other contingent problems with that happening. Watching the booster explosion in slow motion you can see the explosion starts around the position of the common dome which is where the FTS is located. I think they realised the booster propulsion had failed and the FTS was either triggered from the ground or may even have been automatically triggered by the flight control system. Really good news that the pad survived, hot staging seemed to be totally successful and all 33 engines worked well until after separation. The heat shield was disintegrating quite badly just before staging so that is going to need a lot of work.
The way SpaceX operates, I would expect a redesign of the grid fin actuators after replacing three of them.
I thought it was blowing up on the pad.
It was a fun day.  But how much damage did the pad sustain?
✊
I bet on the next launch the will not drop to 3 engines on the booster on stage separation. When the booster ignites it pushes on the booster creating a negative acceleration. I think with more booster acceleration at stage separation along with the decrease of mass when the 2nd stage separated they can minimise negative acceleration and propellant slosh.
Was the sooty-iness of the exhaust (5:58- 6:15) nomimal or was the black color indicating something burning that wasn't supposed to?
Awesome follow up video Marcus...Love your channel.
The main booster shut-down, separation, & rotation almost appears to occur too efficiently, thus disabling the massive fuel plumbing system from gently “re-settling and equalizing” during variable deceleration and accelerations.  They have 65 km of altitude to play with on an upward trajectory, so what’s the hurry?  That said, this was a huge leap in their test program.
Thanks for the update.
Good well produced recap Marcus. Everything I needed to know!!!
😂😂😂😂THIS IS REALLY OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY
Un désastre; point final!
Not gotten, but become!
What an incredible sight to see.
Hey Marcus, what a phenomenal liftoff! A scientific marvel to be sure!🎉😊
That flight brought tears to my eyes as I was hanging off the edge of my seat... excited AF!! What a great surprise this morning of another video from you Marcus, thank you for that great summary of events! 😀
How much does each one of these failures cost?
Right around separation time and especially after you can see negative acceleration of the booster, so the fuel wouldn't still be settled on the bottom of the rocket. They'll need to fix that issue.
Did anyone notice it veering south seconds before stage separation?
I think it was wonderful how all that effort was put into blowing up the rocket. It was amazing.
Thank you, Marcus!
So impressived with your teams turn around time producing this great video!
Maybe the FTS "demonstration" (of the ship at least) was secretly planned, since this was the highest priority issue from the FAA regarding test one.
how are they going to lift off on mars if they already breaks the ground lifting up on earth
The fact that it blew up over the Florida Keys and didn't break up until Puerto Rico gives me hope that it could potentially make it to Hawaii even with a few tiles missing 😅
❤todo bien es un éxito.  Iremos a marte❤
An amazing second flight test, thanks for the breakdown of how everything went!
thanks for the brilliant recap on Sunday!
And this is why I skip all the other videos trying to explain shit.
It’s crazy to think that in a few months from now seeing starships taking off and landing will be as common as a falcon launch 🤯 the future is now
The amount of damage to the pad on this launch compared to the last time is crazy, spacex is really improving a lot each and every launch test!
Look at all that crap you're spewing into the air. Nice job. I hope you do go live on mars.
Hello Marcus! Thanks dor the great explanation! 😊
To the media outlets that don’t understand how important this is to their future, and to the corporate monopolies that operate said outlets, at some point in the future, you may regret reporting these tests as failures.
That really is amazing progress in just two iterations of the BFR. We went from everything going to hell pretty much from ignition to a flawless lift to stage, what appeared at least visually to be a successful hot stage, and S25 running apparently flawlessly up until just before planned engine cutoff. It will be very interesting to get info on what happened with both vehicles, but if progress continues like this the next launch should see this much closer to a complete mission for both vehicles!
Lighting all 6 ship raptors forces a negative G on the booster Check out the negative velocity. They need to keep more booster engines lit or only start 3 ship engines.
A success? Only if you consider blowing up and not reaching design objectives a success.
I know that Elon Musk will prevail, he is a genius and with his team will figure it out how to make everything work
could be the flux capacitor or the flange thats causing a problem . lol .. No seriously Space X and elon musk… incredible. where would we be without the genius of elon musk. Thank god we have him.
Saw you on LabPadre so I came looking for your channel.  Astronomy Live has Starship photos from the Florida Keys, someone (sorry forgot who) has NOAA radar of the two debris fields, and there is that cellphone video taken from Puerto Rico.  All this indicates a flight path way north of all the projected path videos I have seen which had it skirting South America.  Being this far off course (if the projected skirting path is accurate) is alarming considering how normal the first and second stage operations looked.  Was it that far off course or were all those projected path videos wrong?
I know we need space travel, but shouldnt we all be sorting mother earth first. in saying that. ?? way thyings are going therell be no earth.
Not bad for only the second flight. Looks like they may have some fuel delivery issues. SpaceX is doing things nobody has ever done before. Thanks for the awesome analysis!
thank you marcus. your coverage is awesome. I loved seeing you on nsf that was so cool. I hope to see you next time.
After fast tracking the COVID vaccine, you'd think someone would learn a lesson about not rushing through something so important.
Brilliant feedback! Thanks Marcus. Very much looking forward to the next test flight.
If you rewind, starship’s lox tank was draining much more rapidly than before, Scott Manly made a video on this
The fact that BOTH sections blew up independently is hugely concerning.  Terrible engineering all around. Literally anyone can launch rockets.  The hard part is keeping them together.
Starship has left the chat
Ok, I agree that there was some progress, but the prognosis about the program is worse than I expected. After the first launch, we decided, ok we have some issues to address. The the requirement of hot staging was added before we ever had a successful launch. Feature creep is the death of many engineering projects and hot staging is Major Feature Creep. Worse than that, even though we solved the problem of the launch area destruction with the deluge system, and hot staging seemed to nominally function, it does not seem a practical and repeatable launch vehicle. Also the environmental impact has to be huge. First off launching such a huge payload in one shot drives the problem beyond the practical zone of rocketry, you spend all your lift just lifting Starship before you even get to the payload. Starship is just ill-conceived. It would be much more practical to have multiple small launches  and orbital construction facilities. We need a low cost alternative to the space shuttle, orbital construction facilities, and orbital launch capability. In addition, it would be great if we could find an 0ff-Earth fuel and water source such as the moon. I say we learned a lot in the prototyping of Starship, but I think we have seen enough. It is time to scrap the program, re-use all the technology and build something useful.
Saturn 5 had no issues for all its flights. Just saying.
MASSIVE FAILURE.... You're so excited about BOTH sections going B.O.O.M.! !
Great work Marcus. Thanks for sharing your breakdown of the test.
Marcus you are simply the best! You explain better than others on YouTube. Good job Marcus others talk too much but you not. Love your show. You gott a good team.
Why are we now adding  "this is real" BS titles???? Stop catering to imbecils.
Thanks for the video! I was worried I'd have to wait a week to hear your take on this.
C O O L  !!😊
33 engines and 666 test flights? 😂😂😂😂😂
I have visions of something like a car factory when the dip there cars also think he should extend the concrete to catch and recycle the water that is used to prevent run off and pollutants from getting in the environment 😊
Thanks for update Marcus   It was a beautiful sight to see all those engines working perfectly.  Lets hope for quick solution to problems and Flight 3 soon
Lmao, several people owe me $1,000. I bet it would explode, other people bet against it. Should’ve made the bets on the blockchain or something instead, guess I’ll have to do that next time.
Why can't they figure out a way to liquid dip the ship for a heat shield make it one solid shield persay
All I can say is WOW!
Great update, ty and liked :)
I was happy that it flew sooner than the first one, I was happy when the ship cleared the tower, the hot staging. So in all in all a very successful test flight. Now when is the next one ....
I strongly suspect it would be better during hot-staging to leave more than 3 booster engines pushing.  I could definitely imagine that the firing of the Starship engines created enough force to slow the booster too much too quickly for fuel flow to supply the booster raptors sufficiently for re-firing.  I also suspect that Starship ran out of fuel early.  But, what a great attempt ... and considerable improvement on protecting Stage 0!  GO SpaceX!  Thx for your video, Marcus.
You have a pfizer ad? They are crooked
Hi Marcus, your analysis is crystal clear. Thank you for taking time analyzing almost frame by frame of the X's video. Of course SpaceX would promote X as the first vector for the streaming. Very coherently there by the business man Mr Musk. Regards,
Great Summary of the event, thanks Marcus!
Its great to see some milestones ticked off, just need the hot staging sorted, missing tiles sorted and re-entry of both stages.
Before Starship shutdown, or exploded, I noticed that although it's speed continued to increase towards orbital speed, it's altitude was not increasing fast enough. Also, fuel was rapidly decreasing. So, was there an attitude problem which put it on a more horizontal angle?
WOOHOO!!!!! 🌎🌏🌍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I had actually completely missed the ship explosion. So thanks for showing that. Might be time to get a new monitor. 😄
Excellent as usual
Спасибо!!!
I think many people dont understand how freaking impressive it was that the booster performed nominal for the whole flight. If there was any loss in thrust from some Engines it surely wasnt visible, looked like every Engine performed perfectly. This compared to losing around 15% of the engines in the first flight. So yeah arguably they more than 5x the reliability of the engines and brought the failure rate down to less then 1/33 at least from this arguably small sample size. They might have basically fixed all the engine problems and an engine out from now on might become as rare as a Falcon 9 booster failing a landing. SpaceX continues to improve and the next prototype is already in line with many small adjustments and improvements.  Very impressive even though I was really looking forward for that Booster attempting a landing and the Ship reentering. This would have  been a huge amount of very important data, but after this launch I am confident SpaceX will be able to achieve their desired flight path for the ship with  the next launch. Not to mention we now know that the FTS work perfectly fine now rather than taking a minute or so to finally work lol.
way to bend over backwards to prop up an abject failure
Nobody tells the story better. Thanks!
Thank you, Marcus and crew!
It blew up.... Explained
Thanks!
Guys I was a child in the 1960s. This tech is from 1965. Seen this all before.  Had the NatGeo Moon poster on the wall of my bedroom in 1968.  After you put the 12th human on The Moon, get back to me about how exciting this is.  Until then this is literally 60 yo technology.  This was done when I was a kid.
❤💫
Ah, the tiles.  The Achilles heel.  Another method must be found, else, you don't have a usable, much less reusable, spacecraft.
It was a beautiful, clean launch. Not one Raptor engine failed. And Stage Separation was awesome. Enjoyed your guest commentary on Spaceflight Now during launch.
We live in amazing time, watching live how someone sends huge skyscraper into the orbit 🤯
100,000 views in 3 hours. Wow. Your channel has become quite the go-to place for space news, Marcus. Well done.
Thanks  for the shots of Stage 0.
Excellent work, as always, Marcus, great detail.  Thank you very much.
The FTS worked much better this time around...and should assuage any fears the FAA might have had about its  effectiveness which hopefully will spare SpaceX from needing to perform a flight just to prove that they'd fixed it.   If the next flight improves as much as this one did then it's very likely that they'll make it to orbit and more.   I love how SpaceX works...build, fly, blow up...improve and fly again.  SO much more entertaining than delay after delay after delay that we get with Blue Origin and Artemis.
RE: YT vs X streaming. it was very difficult to get the X stream to play on my TV. it was clunky with no settings for sharing easily or check the quality. Hope they fix these issues.
The best post flight account so far. As usual the media gave a superficial analysis.
This is the best most educational video about starship on the web Thanks Marcus
I've been wondering about the water deluge system and how it held up. Looked real good. Any news yet if there is going to be another investigation? Don't they do one pretty much anytime there's a failure and the FTS has to be fired?
At 10:06 you can clearly see the FTS in action.
Great information, Marcus. Many thanks!
☺️💪
I can explain in three words: It    blew    up.
My birthday was yesterday and having a successful launch with all 33 raptors and a successful hotstage was an amazing present from Spacex!
Fantastic recap Marcus.
OOOOOO big powerful rocket! More space trash.
Let's be honest that was a huge disappointment. only sucess is all raptor working. Separation seems to have destroyed the booster so failed. Not even orbit of the ship.
there will be 3rd starship flight test ?
A great recap! Thanks! 🚀
Some of the most incredible footage and pics
It blew up.. you peopke really know no shame. It blew up and you still call it a success.
Did Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Shuttle. or Dragons have flight termination systems? For safety of flight issues, is it better for manned and proven vehicles to land in one piece; or, generate a debris field?
Wonderful overview. Thanks for the hard work that went into preparing it.
Thank you for this very welcome explanatory video, Marcus.  My first impression was that this Starship was travelling much faster than its predecessor, but I didn't realise by how much. Third time lucky?
I'm so sad I missed the live launch. We all can be proud of SpaceX, I think.
The haters are coping so hard. They said what happened yesterday would be impossible. They keep pushing the goal posts. Still thinking that starship will never be successful. Such a small world view and hateful thinking they have.
In my opinion there is a problem with the liquid fuel and the tanks that contain it, while the rocket ascends gravity and acceleration keep the fuel at the bottom of the tank and the engines are supplied at all times, but when the landing maneuver occurs Undock from the ship, the fuel is no longer at the bottom of the tank and it cannot be continuously supplied to the engines, leaving them to function correctly. In the ship after undocking there is also no fuel supply problem because it is accelerating and is located at the bottom of the tank where the pipes that send it to the engines are, but when the ship continues to ascend and gravity decreases along with the decrease in acceleration, the engines are no longer continuously supplied with fuel, once again having operating problems and eventually breaking down. Liquids in the absence of gravity, even if the tanks are pressurized, cannot be supplied to the engines continuously as occurs at ground level. They would have to make tanks that, in addition to being pressurized, had some system that would make fuel available to the engines without the problems caused by the lack of gravity or loss of acceleration. A solution that I propose could be that the tank had a kind of press or piston that, as the fuel is consumed, the volume of the tank would adjust to the volume of fuel, preventing it from floating around the tank and always available to the pipes that supply it. the engines. It's an opinion, maybe those at Space X have already solved this problem.
It was an incredible event, making it as far as they did. They do have a lot of data analysis to pore over and one very visible problem, the loss of heat shield tiles. There has to be a better way to affix them to stainless steel, I hope they find it. Anyone know what they’re using presently?
Maybe the Super Heavy Booster needs smaller header tanks similar to the Starship, for boostback.
Is it just shadow or is that black smoke from the booster at around 6 minutes in the video?
How many of the 33 engines must remain running to achieve orbit at maximum takeoff weight?
Im still not over how epic this was. I reallt want to see a starship launch irl one day..
They still ran into the water hammer effect. Think about it: it’s screaming through the sky then loses most of its thrust, THEN gets hit by ALL SIX ENGINES AT ONCE. Then it rotates. That fluid was every but where it needed to be.
Just my observations......it seems to me it still took a bit longer for it to liftoff that it should have.   Also while the speeds during the climb were much better than original it still seemed a little slower that is should have been.  Now perhaps all was within normal/expected range.   This kinda makes me wonder what the formula is for thrust vs acceleration to attain a normal orbital trajectory?   And remember this is with no payload on Starship itself.
I’m ready to jump on board.  Who’s with me?
As I understand it, this is the only real business that Musk has.  The rest are promises and disasters or taking credit for other people's work.
Marcus, good job to you! SPACEX, good job to you! Elon Musk, team, , good job to  you!  DON'T STOP!
Thanks Marcus for another great episode covering the launch with the others!   After hearing from others and you're self, it sounds like at least for the Booster that fuel slogging around is now bigger issue perhaps.   I know they want maximize efficiency, but I think not having engines on during the separation would be better, Falcon 9 has been doing these maneuvers for while and restarting engines.   Is the Super Heavy vehicle that different that it can't do same as Falcon 9? Fueling hammering and movement would maybe reduce risk of that being issue.   Hopefully, they'll figure out.
Thanks!
Always such a delightful deluge of information spraying rapidly and happily to us... thank you Marcus
How many years before Starship is certified for humans?
Hot staging was beautiful.   I feel like the visual effect needs a name.  Like The Raptor Rose Or Starship's Star
Thanks Marcus !
Why is his channel name Marcus house?
look like no fuel was getting in to  engines after flip on booster
Excellent recap and explanation Marcus!  Hope you have a wonderful week!  🚀💥
Elon thinks his team still need to find 998 ways how this mission should not be executed.😅
The FAA has it wrong, it’s not a commercial vehicle, it’s a test bed at this point and they dam well know it. They are bullies.
Thanks. Explains so much. And the outrageous photos and videos detailed the sequence of events and issues (which of course will undergo much review to diagnose remaining problems to redress).
Im kinda thinking the hot stage needs to ramp up to full thrust.  Cuz this looked explosive, maybe the fuel ended up being sloshed too much to be usable for the return flight.
I would have liked to seen the images of the debris field saw one radar still frame. one guy said he saw some debris reentering and posted a short vid.
Thank you Marcus for bringing us a  positive review of a fantastic achievement. Not like others.  You are the best.  Keep up the good work
I'm ashamed i missed it. Have seen most since SN9 and wanted to see this. Have just gotten so bored and tired with all the 24/7 coverage of every single aspect of SpaceX between the launch tests that i haven't kept up😅
What a great day for the advancement of space exploration. Just imagine if NASA was ran like SpaceX by someone who shared the same values as Elon Musk. I remember watching the moon landing in 69 as a child and it’s been truly a blessing to have my grandchildren watching as Elon Musk takes us into the next phase of space exploration. I had honestly hoped in the beginning that BO would have contributed to the advancement of space exploration as much as SpaceX. Sadly they seem more interested in producing amusement park rides and taking taxpayer dollars than producing anything worthwhile. Unfortunately there will still be considering this launch a failure when in fact it was a huge success. Congratulations to everyone involved at SpaceX that made this incredible launch possible 🎉
I see a lot of negativity around this launch and it's rud. I find it funny how many milestone achievements they completely neglect to recognize.

A Space X deveria pagar uma multa por poluição ambiental.  Se navio que solta óleo no mar paga,  por que um foguete que lançou com a explosão poluentes na atmosfera não paga? Elon Musk está tranquilo porque está queimando dinheiro do contribuinte americano., não o dele.
The launch site should have a large water pool with metallic conductors to absorb enormous heat generated by the booster? Water has high heat capacity and tons of heat energy can be absorbed by boiling water?
"Just off the coast of Puerto Rico" -  oh, came that close?   Tiles falling off?  Good luck!  This is nothing more than a pipe dream!  Will be mothballed soon, too risky to ever transport humans!  Odds are like 1 in 1,000,000 that this will ever work out.  Not "glass half empty", just reality.
i really enjoy how you explain and break down information Thank you and keep up the good work.
Am I wrong to guess that they intentionally blew up the ship over the Atlantic because they knew the speed was there to make it to the Hawaii area but so many heat tiles fell off they knew it wouldn't make it back down in one piece anyway sooo... just boom it now???
Disaster after disaster for the SpaceX super rocket as the second try blew up in flight. SpaceX is getting behind schedule for the race to the moon as China has tested her Longmarch 10 rocket successfully, the rocket that would bring the taikonauts to the moon before the decade is over.
Thanks Marcus for a great video as usual and SpaceX for putting on such a great show
Was L. Ron Musk strapped to the exhaust of this thing?  No?  Then why the fuck are you bothering us?
Thanks for the update, Marcus.
Best explanation ever. Thank you.
I don't think, hot staging is the way to go. To little risk/reward
The funny thing is they didn’t need to swap out the grid fin actuator. Lol
I think they should send just the booster to space and try to return and catch it before combining both starship and booster
Im old enough to have watched the Apollo flights as a small boy. I have never lost my interest and astonishment with the reach for space. To see humankind stretch out again is so awesome.  Thank you SpaceX.
In just under 8 years nasa went from mercury to apollo11 and neil Armstrong walking on the moon and im having to listen and watch a movie directed by nasa and fronted by space x😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you Marcus to be as usually very informative and concise in the same time.  And thanks a  lot for your stable and calm presentation mode since years (especially compare to most of other space newsmakers who are going the pass of click baiting silly titles, visualizations and loud comments). Best regards!
Just because all 33 engine stay on the whole way makes it seems unreal every time I see a render 😅
Lots of good info, Marcus!  Thank you!
not to mention the fact that it's a 6 minute flight from Brownsville Tx to Puerto Rico that is very impressive
Does the starship engines fires directly at the booster?
I❤Marcus House
Excellent video Marcus and team!!!
Wonderful comparisons and the best details so far. A very nice production much appreciated. Thank you!
Marcus Man you need to get back on top of your videos. you use to be one of the first to post about these things and your almost 20 Hours late to the Party. we all had this info from videos yesterday.
That was much further than N1 ever got. Next time we should see Starship burning up while arriving near Hawaii.
A great rundown. Concise and to the point. Well done.
MARCUS! WOW MAN! what an unbelievable flight! My 15-year-old son and my 11-year-old daughter woke up to watch this with me. I was watching the live stream of it from 4am and never went back to sleep because my heart rate wouldn’t allow me to. Thank you so much for posting this video. It’s amazing. Thank you for all you do and keep it up brother!
What is truly epic is how this launch has exceeded the ridiculously low expectations of the SpaceX fanboys.
Thanks Marcus. Great report
i think there was a lack of fuel... The behavior of the engines shutting down was similar in both stages. And if I am correct, they won't admit it anytime soon, as Musk will have a significant challenge on his hands... where the only solution will be more efficient engines.
Thx for this very nice presentation. Very informative. Yesterday, it was wonderful to see so many of the problems of the first launch having been resolved. You perhaps forgot to mention that the flight termination system also worked flawlessly this time around :-)
Two Marcus House episodes in one day, plus a guest appearance on NSF!  Wow!  Thanks Marcus!😁
From the first to this test flight in night & day. Just think how much better StarShip TF3 will go.  At every step with SpaceX you can see big growth.  I think you are the most accurate, I appreciate that you take the time to be ‘Right’ not first. Thank you MH and team.
Great summary of a great day.
Thank you for the update
Thank you Marcus, I couldn't watch it live but your coverage spared me from missing any important details. You are the man!
What an amazing launch, its such a shame the views of the Ship were so bad. hopefully we'll get better ones in the coming days
Great job on the booster operation.  It appears the hot seperation part needs quite a bit more work, as it appears that is where the problems appeared.  Perhaps there is too much push back by the Starship onto the booster, and things perhaps get too hot.  This is solvable I suspect.  No worries.
The worlds biggest firework.
Awesome Marcus.  Was so excited for your vid. Great work mate 👍🏾
Ahhh didya the stars ? I mean, the stars above the rocket?? At time: 1.40 -- Did I see Buzz Lightyear ooops Buzz Aldrin? is that his name (oh damn) in a documentary (half my life ago) giving an in-depth (sounded like space shipT) explanation of why we can't see any stars in any photos they took on the moon ?¿? But we can see stars in Elon's photo, through the atmosphere, past huge spotlights atop the tower facing down at the camera, past the reflective shiney SPACE SHIP, out to stars that are 10's of lightyears away, and they look soo bright if I paused the video I'd be able to identify them, butt BUZZ CAMERAMAN couldn't get ONE SINGLE DOT ON ANY PHOTO, no atmosphere, no spotlights, no 400ft high 30ft wide shiney space ship in the way??? What the flap BUZZARD ?? and while you're here, who punched the letter C into the ROCK hey? No No I'm not talkin' about Dwayne... He's exhausted dealin with OPRA SPENDTHRIFT, the stingy witch!! What?? B ...
I remember Musk saying that it was like not a good chance that it would make it.  Like 50 50 or something.
Awesome watching the development of this watershed tool in real time.
Nice rundown…thanks.
Nothing to "explain".  It was a FAIL.
Thanks Marcus, your video explained very well what happened during the flight, please keep it up and keep us updated on what happens next with Spacex and Starship 👍🏻
Thanks for that. I did see one of the storage tanks at launch site had a big dent in the side. Any idea what hit it ?
How close did 25 get to space?
The heat shield is gonna be a big challenge. They could get everything else right and still struggle to make it work.
Now they got clearance for that launch.... they can line them up and go go goo... as long as the next flight is identical it would be like the same clearance... so they could launch rhe next one in days or weeks?
What's with all the orange after booster separation until starship rud?
That lunch was so awesome great update Marcus and team GO SpaceX!!!
The height of delusional thinking. Calling a failure a success. This country hasn't told itself the truth in over 30-years.
I think the shouldnt have activated flight termination system at 90km height  They should have let it come down to 4 km height  and collect more data
👍👍👍🇮🇳
Congratulations SpaceX on another exciting launch! Thank you so much for being the heart and soul of America’s space efforts! Your work is appreciated.
thanks - fast to be the on the reporting  well done
Why all the hype?  It failed and blew up….
wonderful coverage the last few days!
Hot staging "worked," but I think it led to the destruction of the ship. That shock wave also shocked the ship and booster.
Two videos in one week. How good are you. Thank you Marcus House.
Parked right across the street from the OLM and see the roof panels on the road side building at the security box were rolled back and a panel near the security box. Nothing major…
@SpaceToday, seria legal fazer um review assim para a galera do Brasil
Great report - thank you!
Great recap, Marcus. Thanks again for good stuff.
Imagine how dumb and easily manipulated by capitalist pigs that you’d think this is a success. I wish my major failures were major successes in the work place. That’d be great.
Huge thanks for the briljant recap, super!
…Shplendid!
The launch was a marvelous feat of engineering from SpaceX, so glad it was successful in stage separation but I think Marcus hit the nail on the head when first stage doing a flip maneuver started losing its engines I bet 10to 1 it was because they lost fuel pressure
You if a Chinese rocket had the spectacular explosion and failure like your western rocket it will be all over the western media, and MSM within seconds. Still can't get yourself to admit it's not a success but a FAILURE 😅😅😅. Like you all call out the mast Indian space launch failure a success cos you are courtib them to be your friend as you all are jealous and hate China 😅😅😅
One asteroid will pay for all this ; and then some.
Two parts experienced RUD, has it really  been success ?
Only start the 3 small engines of starship at stage sep. That would be not so "violent".
I think I have another idea why they dont cut off all engines at once. The hydraulic shock off not letting that fuel thats in motion pass would probably be quite something.
Amazing coverage as always, Marcus! Your breakdown of these events is just phenomenal! The images are mind boggling indeed. I do have a question though - I was under the impression that this was supposed to be an uncrewed test flight. Do SpaceX have any estimation on when they might be able to start including crew in these tests? Just curious about the timeline. Keep up the excellent work!
One more step to the Moon and Mars! Congratulations Space X
I wish you had done a live video. ALL the non Space x ones were just people going "yes! Yes!! YES!!!" More than a badly written porm movie. The space x one on youtube  seemed to be a crypto ad. (Which was likely a spam site since you mentioned elon ignored youtube.) Gave up and skimmed one of the less annoying ones about 30 Min later.
I wonder how soon they can prep IFT3. My hope is 3-4 months.
There was one image I remember seeing yesterday of a partially collapsed tank on the ground. Was there any information on what happened to that?
Expect that the Starship ignition punched a hole or two in the top of the booster methane tank, leading to the engine failures, and subsequent need to actuate the booster FTS. Maybe the Starship was accidently destroyed by an inadvertent actuation of its FTS.
I would call it a successful failure and fun as hell to watch. Going to be interesting to see what the fts were triggered for.
Guess I picked the wrong “SpaceX” stream. I saw a crypto commercial instead on the launch   😡
Darn expensive fireworks.
Absolutely historic.
EXPLOSION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! little woke
Going to be difficult for Blue Organ to top these launches... if they ever get past building facilities and actually start developing and building rockets...
I was amazed at how long the fiery plume of 33 engines was; if the rocket is approx. 500 ft long, the plume was almost double this.
The SpaceX webcast was broadcast on their website and the quality was excellent. I think in the background that broadcast is hosted on YouTube so no latency.
"Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly" is just dumb.
That was stupendous! To see all those 33 engines firing so cleanly and for so long and the way they shutdown on booster engine cut-off (to leave the middle three on for hot-staging). Not shown here but the booster quick disconnect seemed to be flaming out shortly after take off. This could be briefly seen as the smoke / clouds cleared from the launch pad.
Oh my god you can actually see individual imprints of the outer raptors on the deluge pad
Rapid disassembly IMPLIES it was done on purpose!  Stop lying. That was an unplanned explosion! And if you're not confident all 33 engines would still be running as designed, then you had no right to take this EXPERIMENT to the pad😮.
If the final velocity was short of orbital speed that seems it is a major issue.  Will SpaceX now use all Raptor3 motors?
Net zero... Climate Change.....Net Zero....Climate Change.
Both my 4 year old daughter and i were screaming and dancing at the TV when we saw the rocket launch fully then both screamed again when it separated was a great experience for her to be able to see history being made
Girò muy ràpido y quedan motores sin combustible? con los tres centrales no era suficiente para girarlo y mismo enviòn luego par segundos alimente los otros?
It finally happened! The launch did not disappoint in any respect. I'm really glad the launchpad deluge system performed so well. It got absolutely hammered during the first flight test but this time was different. I'm disappointed the Super Heavy booster and Starship 25 were lost, but again, they at least got to perform before their demise. Hopefully, SpaceX got the telemetry they needed to make any improvements to continue the march toward a completely successful flight test. 🚀🚀🎉
It's simply awesome and breathtaking by Spacex. It was one of the best things I have seen in my life, incredible. Slainte Marcus & teams for all you've hard work done throughout the years. 👍 ❤😢
Excellent analysis Mr. House!  In view of the success at hot stage separation and no damage to stage zero I can only view this flight as a success.  I hope they have enough info to determine the problem that caused the loss of Ship 25.  Reentry will be a challenge with that current tile fastening system.
So full of Muskian stupidity.
good effort
Thanks...500,000 in sight! Congratulations 👏
Excelent work Marcus team!
Scott Manley did an excellent video on what happened to the rocket and booster. He noticed from the display that the oxygen suddenly started going down very fast towards the end. He also zoomed in on the rocket as it was accelerating and noticed it was losing a lot of heat tiles!
Great video! Thank you. Unfortunately, I can’t believe that a want to be fascist like Elon is going to allow you to publish content about his bright, shiny new toy on YouTube for much longer. My guess is that he will force you to either use his new hate filled X or nothing.
0:09 always impresses me how you can see that shock-sound wave expanding just when they light up the engines. Great stuff!
They are never going to get those heat shields to work.
Excellent recap, good job.  I'll be sharing this one with friends and family.
So how long until 3rd flight? Another  7 months?
What an amazing launch and watching videos on X side-by-side comparison, you could tell the first attempt had no chance to get to space! They've now put their first ship in space and were probably only 15-20 seconds of acceleration from getting to their desired velocity!!  Was quite a thing to watch booster blow. At T+7:12, something also happened in the orange plume in the sky - I think it was a LOX leak or something as it had more than CH4 until after that.
amazing video
I watched the launch live and had to wait to get Marcus's take on it 😅
Dang! Was that a sonic boom at 5:47?😮
Well done Elon, you can almost touch Mars, not….😂😂😂
That was the most amazing flight ever
Total destruction of the vehicle, and this guy puts a positive spin on everything 😂well done.
What about that Water Deluge System? At 5:30 It looked like it was leaking??? Or did I miss something?
Outstanding job on this report Marcus!  👍🏻🇺🇸    A couple of the other channels just sit there and gripe about negative media reports, while you consistently push forward with the accomplishments and hurdles that have been overcome,  while keeping your story focus headed onward and upward!   🚀
Wow, tremendous video Marcus and team, lookout Scott Manley!!!!
So wait- did the second stage explode or did it get lost?
Geat brief Marcus... 🇮🇶
Why isn’t anyone asking why no camera mounted views from booster or starship where seen in any footage from Space x?
Cheers Marcus  🍻
that was one of the best explanations on what went on...thank you
A lot of hard work by talented engineers, tradespeople, and technicians.  The 3rd flight is going to be very interesting.
Interesting how the tension in my body grew exponentially as stage 1 continued to perform perfectly. After hot staging, though, the Starship was on its way and I could breathe again. Thank you, Marcus, and the team, for going the extra kilometer to summarize less than one Sol after the event!
awesome explosion
I think that the way they did the Starship engine start up in that hot staging is the problem?  They should have not done it. Instead they should have seen how NASA did the Saturn 5 staging where the stages decoupaged and small solid rockets on both stages  fired to push each apart so that the next stage fired up the rockets well away from the lower stage thus saving them from any damaging flames or buckling from the next rockets firing up.  The G-Forces then are at the highest so you need to make sure the next stages rockets don't cause such extra forces that the lower stage does not explode?  So Space X change the system to a non hot ring with small solid booster rockets on both stages to fire so both stages move apart  then fir up the starships rockets when it is well away from the super heavy booster rocket.  That's just simple logic, see what was a safe system before and do it as you know it is the best proven one to save your rockets.
Elon Musk simp channels must have to contort themselves to call that Starship launch a success.  lol.
That new ring needs a fix quick! Other wise great day.🇺🇸🇮🇱
Great report Marcus. The footage was top notch too. Incredible improvements from SpaceX I really feel they'll have this nailed in the next few flight tests. Keep up the great work.
Next launch before Xmas to maximise this years launch opportunities?
I think the Booster failed simply because the Starship pushed back on it too much. The tanks went boil
It almost looks real!
Funny... all the environment leftist all keep quiet with all the thousands upon thousands of of crap now in the water effecting the corals, sea life, and the ecosystem in general. Hilarious that only care if it were a conservatives or right leaning agency. lol I support space exploration. I am only stating it is ridiculous at the hypocrisy from the left. More crap has been deposited in that costal water. Silent on that. People have micro memories. Was only a few years ago every damn media outlet... SAVE THE CORAL! Stop everything. Fish are people too! Sound familiar? It should! It was everywhere! Those same extreme people apparently only cared to sway  voters and donor money. I think I will fall over from surprise.
This flight was an extremely valuable test, and gave SpaceX super important information for futher flight tests
Marcus, that was an excellent and erudite analysis. Kudos.
Starship's hot gases slamming into the booster slowed the booster such that fluids sloshed horrifically.
Wow Marcus, that’s the best breakdown of yesterday’s launch I’ve seen anybody produce. Keep up the good work.
Much improvement, much learned, iterate, improve and relaunch.  SpaceX inspiration.
Imagine if Amazon helped fund this with Elon.
11:34 if ksp thought me something it's that the final stretch matters the most
Thank you so much, Team Marus, for this incredible recap of Launch #2!
Great report!
I watch your channel because you get straight to the point with no extra bullshit.  Thanks for making good content Marcus.
Thanks!
The 33 engines, and those utterly enormous macromachdiamonds was epic! 9M wide Mach diamonds, fully supick!
And MSM calls it a total failure. They really hate Elon.
Although we didn't see the devastation like last time out with Stage Zero, there was some damage. With it also looking like the white tanks next to the launch mount being once again distorted by the huge magnetic fields being created by the separated electrical, generated by massed rocket engines.
🎉big improvement from SpaceX!!!
Having all 33 engines firing all the way to MECO plus having a successful hot stage separation was incredible and both massive achievements. Anything afterward was just icing on the cake
Marcus, you are a legend!! This is a perfect summary of the flight and the achievements made! Love the engine shutdown slow-mo. Hoping for some splashdowns in January.
The IFT-2 is amazing! Look forward to the next launch!!!
Thanks for being on the NSF livestream. I loved that.
Nice recap of the launch, thanks!
Thank you! You have the best, most informative presentation. You are always to the point.
But... DAMN that was a good flight! A lot of data gathered, a lot of lessons to be learned.
Please go back to jiggling when you say "hey hey Marcus House" its not fair to start it and then just stop, and wheres that onlyfans?
You know what irks me? Seeing all the people on social media after every single 'TEST' flight suddenly becoming 'keyboard Wernher Von Brauns' and just criticizing the end result. They don't follow the progress of this or any other brand new rocket. They have no basic understanding of what's going on and what was expected. They don't remember the early days of falcon 9 and the exact same criticisms they had of falcon 9 suddenly and magically disappeared from the comments today. I don't understand why people comment publicly on matters they know nothing about. People are toxic, it's unbelievable. While the internet allows us unprecedented access to follow progress, it also empowers those without insight to voice uninformed and idiotic opinions."
The fact that you have failed to get your rocket into orbit means you failed. This is twice now. How many Saturn V rockets were destroyed before they were able to get all the engines, staging, and control systems working. NONE. We have already gone to the moon and back several times. If you can't get into orbit without blowing up after it has been done thousands of times in the past speaks volumes. The only issue to going to mars is developing systems that will last and sustain life during the long voyage. Not getting it into orbit! This is more like a religious following than a scientific endeavor. Even if the God explodes it's still a success. Wow 33 rocket engines all lit and ran. What an accomplishment! Ukraine, the U.S. military, NATO, Israel, Palestine, Hamas, Russia light and run hundred, if not thousands of rocket engines that remain running until they hit their targets.
It's amazing how the Left MSM has reported on this EPIC forward move for humanity.  They concentrate on the rocket blowing up - a second time.  NO mention on how historic or the sheer magnitude of this achievement is.  Anything to insult/criticize Elon Musk. Sickening really and regrettably displays the less desirable traits of humanity. Great men DO - little men criticize.
The flame column that is longer than the Statue of Liberty is tall, THAT IS REAL!👍
Did anyone else mistake the rocket for a lightsaber at first glance?
starship 2nd stage run out fuel before get to in the orbit,,,the FUEL tank has not enough for the 6 engine
Excellent summary 😊
Great flight but am I the only one that noticed a flash of light (that looked like an explosion) at the top of booster nine straight after ship separation.
你的解说很及时❤❤❤
3rd times a charm
I remember what you (Marcus) said during the LabPadre live-stream, that you were most curious to see how many engines would fire, and stay on. You were right, having all 33 engines made all the difference.  The speed of liftoff was so much faster than the first test flight.
When is the next launch happening?
It was impressive, but they are still far from making it routine
Is it cheaper to buy/produce O2 than it is to re-condense it?
Keep up the good work SpaceX
Very good $$$$$
Excelentes programa y gracias por poner subtitulos en español lo disfruté
It's a shame that Marcus has to add a caption to say the thumbnail was real. I've blocked more than one channel for clickbait thumbnails in the recent past and these were people I previously respected.
You forgot the "WAS"  on your thumbnail.
Been waiting 4 yrs to see this fucking amazing. I bet next flight they will get it. Just awesome
What an absolutely resounding success this launch was! Fantastic! So many firsts, so many milestones! History in the making! 👏👏👏👏👏👏🚀😍🚀😍
Expect 2nd hand raptors to be advertised on Alibaba in the coming months. After the CCP recovers them from the bottom of the  Gulf and off the USA continental shelf.
So happy to sea it leave the launchpad so quickly, obviously a vast improvement on launch 1 and the deluge system seems to work great , time will tell 👍
Anyone notice that the remaining propellant, according to the animated guide at the bottom of the screen, was about the same level (almost fully depleted) at the stage FTS ignited on both booster and ship? Seems very purposeful. Seems there was never enough propellant for a re-entry or a full boost back attemp. I'd say spacex tested exactly what they wanted to on this attempt.
This is a remarkable achievement it should be celebrated. Can’t wait for the next one
Have seen also others covering this event f.e. Felix, and I really liked your direct comparison with the first flight.👍Great idea!
from tesla to spacehip.......musk is the Most expert in the World about fire.Could be special guest in Naples like artistic director fireworks last day of the year
Seems stupid to wreck this planet so you can go an live on another one
Sabotage? They should check the workers........
It looks like some of the take off stand had suffered some major soil erosion and blast around the stand. Why don't Starship put an extra thin SS sleeve or web over the heat shield tiles to keep them in place. This will degrade on re-entry, but over the flight no chance of loosing tiles.
the "ignite/turn off at will" of the raptors now seems to be the major difficulty of the whole program
Does anyone know what the venting from the deluge tank farm on the left is all about?
Here’s what we do or elon for that matter , let elon have access to the ufo’s so he can build a proper ship that will be able to fly and get to outter space faster ! Without this technology that the government has we as humans all fail . Not hard to figure out we all are being held back now is the time to build proper things
i understand that not everybody is gonna like the same stuff that you do but i can't believe how so many people don't really care about starship its so epic to see how could you want to miss it!
that was really freaking awesome to watch !!
Thanks for the summary and the frame by frame analysis of the unknowns. This launch was one of the most epic moments of 2023, for sure.
W
Was fun eeh😂😂🤣
At stage separation, and the Starship vacuum engines firing up, I was surprised at just how quickly afterwards the Starships sea level engines fired up - I was expecting a few seconds delay - but it seemed like there was only a one second delay between all of the vacuum engines starting up, and the sea level engines starting up.
When do we get to see the onboard shots!
What an awesome day. I was fortunate to be there for this one. Watched from the roof of the Holliday Inn Resort. Marcus, you are awesome...
Since yesterday was looking for the launch pad intactness finally you showed it up. Gr8 job guys. Shout out to RGV.
the comments in social media about it to hit the "firmament" is driving me crazy
Starship got shot down by the real life Borg… “Watch your futures END…” Musk’s launch 🚀 has been prevented. Stupid Humans DIE on Earth 🌍. No escape
Of course its resl,it blew up 😂😂🔥
Did everyone catch the high altitude WB57 in the background, during the early moments of flight?  It was in a holding pattern off the coast of Mexico prior to launch.
That is the most incredible part to me. Raptor reliability seems to be fine. I thought for sure it would take half a dozen launches to get through one without losing at least one engine. But they did it on the second flight. That is just bonkers. And the way they shut down just before staging looks like a video game or something. The pattern of engines shutting down from the outside in, it looks like LEDs turning off or something. What an incredible vehicle.
Thank you. I refuse to watch content from anyone else. I waited anxiously.
An interesting question which has also been posted on Twitter is that if you assume that the Starship dry mass is 150t (probably less) without payload, Booster dry mass is 200t (could well be, apparently the hot staging ring alone is 10t) and use fuel mass data from SpaceX's (even recently updated) website you get that the Booster with Starship on top should produce about 3km/s of delta-v, with 10% of fuel left for boostback and landing. However, the velocity at MECO of around 5600km/h equates to only 1.56km/s which implies gravity losses of almost 1.5km/s!  Gravity over the 150 seconds of flight causes about 1.5km/s, but that's only if the vehicle were to go straight up, which it doesnt't. So why did they not achieve that delta-v and more importantly, how will they get 150t of payload into orbit if they used basically all the propellant for an empty Ship? (btw, drag likely only accounts for less than 100m/s)  Data and calculations: Ship:   150t dry mass / 1350t wet mass Booster:   200t dry mass / 3600t wet mass / 540t at 10% fuel --> full stack mass at start of Booster burn:   4950t --> full stack mass at MECO (10% fuel in Booster):   1890t  Raptor sea-level ISP:   325s standard gravity:   9.81m/s²  Booster Δv:   9.81*325*ln(4950/2890) m/s = 3070m/s observed v at MECO:    5600km/h / 3.6 (m/s)/(km/h) = 1560m/s --> observed losses:   3070m/s - 1560m/s = 1510m/s  stage-sep at 2:30min = 150sec --> cumulative gravity loss:   150s * 9.81m/s² = 1470m/s  ==> However, vehicle is mostly flying at an angle and therefore not experiencing the entire gravity loss Rough estimate of actual gravity loss - don't quote me on that you would need to analyse the flight path, know the T/W ratio, angle, etc. along the entire path to calculate it: about 75% of the theoretical gravity loss, which equates to:   1470m/s*0.75 = 1100m/s This is almost 400m/s short of the observed deviation from the calculated Δv, which could in turn well be above 1.5km/s, maybe around 1.7km/s depending on Raptor ISP, remaining fuel in tanks, vehicle dry masses and so on
Let’s focus on all that worked as planned, and how much more worked this time than last time.   Awesome progress. Thank you, Elon. Thank you, Marcus.
Marcus - excellent as ever! Many thanks.
Great show Marcus love your presentation
That drone pilot had THE most important job that day, above anything else...record what happens lol. I'm so blessed that we get the opportunity to see these angles. Growing up watching the shuttle we didn''t have jack shit lol.
The good news about the 2 RUD... It confirmed the FTS worked aok okiedokie artichokie. Was spectacular.
Thanks for getting this out so quickly!
Loved your appearance on NSF marcus
Great explanation, Marcus, love your channel!💯👍
Cool to see!
Thank you, I knew I could count on you for an excellent synopsis.
awesome !! very exciting. I cant wait for the next flight. Space X is incredible....peace out
Fantastic summary of yesterday's momentous event. Thanks for this - can't wait for FT-3!! Go SpaceX. (from the UK)
There must be big ballon fly near the rocket to give better view to the rocket
A lot of debris is added tho
EXCELLENT report! None of the negativity of the nay-sayers, and still accurately describing what we could not ourselves witness. Congratulations to SpaceX, and the Marcus House Team! Marvelous Launch, and Marcus House coverage!
Great video great flight can't wait for the next one's
Starship definitely has a long way to go.  It will likely be 2 years, possibly even more before we have people on Mars.
Due to the fact that this launch was a success I think we should put a crew of 100 on top of the next rocket to simulate a moon mission !  If starship has another R.U.D RAPID UNSCHEDULED DISASSEMBLY the crew will experience a R.U.R.T.C.B.S.  RAPID UNSCHEDULED RETURN TO CARBON-BASED STATUS !
Was there no onboard footage or hasn’t it been released?
Just imagine if all this money was used to improve the biodiversity and future of our planet and not just fuel the ego of charlatan billionaires? The world would be a better place.
The tiles have undergone a suction test on ship 28, a test that wasn’t performed on ship 25.
Love your work Marcus!
Marcus! I don't think that is Booster 25... 1:28
Great success! One step closer with tons of data on how not to do things in the future.
At some point SpaceX will realize that the massive Starship concept is not feasible. The proven method is to pare down the mass on the way up and the way down. Falcon 9 would be a lower cost technology demonstrator. Early concepts for Apollo was a massive vehicle. The cost to maintain that much mass in flight and safely return it was quickly proven to be a pipe dream.
I think they need to put a film over the tile surface to hold them in place during the massive vibrations of liftoff. It can just burn off on re-entry
I was absolutely ecstatic when I saw all 33 engines running strong!
Scott Manley speculates that fuel hammering and starvation killed the booster, and even the SpaceX live stream hosts eluded to that when it happened. Fuel slosh in zero g is quit the headache, and a giant elongated tank makes that so much worse. I would love to see their solution, but that is one of those things they fix, and we never see
How could the debris field be in Puerto Rico?.... Serious question
lOVED IT...BUT WHY NO ON BOARD CAMERAS?
Thanks for the 2nd flight review Marcus. I was a little late to the live launch and was looking around on youtube trying to find your live stream. There were so many "pop-up" streams it was all very confusing. I wonder if there was a way for you share a link for us to click on that takes us to your stream or one that you're on? Anyway, onward and upward!!!
Blessed Sunday vid, let’s gooooo 🙏
Between you, Scott Manley, WAI and Everyday Astronaut I’ve got at least a couple of hours awesome space video every week!! 👍😊😊
Awesome Marcus!
Let me splain! Elon  mansplaining his failures.
That was a pretty amazing launch! To me, the Raptor engine was the most critical part of the equation and seeing all 33 Raptors firing up until stage separation showed that SpaceX made an immense amount of progress in that area. Maybe the fact that the RVac on SN25 are a year old contributed to the fact that the ship failed during ascent. I am really curious to find out what really happened. But what a spectacle to witness!
you know jeff is poopping his pants watching this thing fly...
This is like listening to a scientologist
This was a pure joy to watch, I'm so excited for the next flight with all the data they will have collected from this attempt!
So the reason for ship 25 RUD was not enough velocity to enter  semi-orbit? What caused the engines fail all at once right before?
It blowed up. It blowed up real good.
Después de la evaluación, claro esta, sr. Elon que sigue? no hay que perder tiempo!
Flight termination system triggered too early??
I'm impressed by the consistent improvements. Each new flight brings us closer to the orbit. And mind you this is the rocket that one day will be on its way to Mars. Few more years.
Scott Manley speculates that FTS was never triggered.
G’day Marcus, thanks for your update mate! What a launch!! Before we know it they’ll be catching the big bastard out of the sky…. can’t wait!!!
It was more impressive in the 60s when we went to the moon.  Chemically propelled rockets will never accomplish anything beyond launching satellites and rich people on expensive thrill rides.  For the money we threw away on "Ukraine" (really just laundering it back to politicians and billionaires here) we could have had 4 separate manhattan projects going on simultaneously to develop new physics.  Gravity wave generation, something.  If we did it right (didn’t let people steal it all) I’d hope at least one of the 4 would be successful.  Otherwise we’re trapped on this shithole prison planet forever.  Because Elon knows we’re not going to Mars.  That’s just aspirational marketing.  And because we wasted it on Ukraine, we don’t have the $100B it would take to waste to put Lizzo (or a really obese black woman like her) on the moon to twerk and bring her fat ass safely back to earth - the new American dream.   As cool as this rocket is, I can’t look at it without thinking about the context.  It’s almost 2024 for fuck's sake.  A rocket a little bigger than the Saturn 5…  it’s been over half a century.  Taken in a knowledge vacuum (e.g. the mind of a TikTok user) this was impressive.  But otherwise it’s actually just really sad, depressing Clownworld shit.
I believe the booster raptors failure can be solved by redesigning the fuel feed system and layout to survive the flip and turn but the starship second stage raptor complete and sudden failure going straight is a puzzle.
Let's hope spacex shares some details of what exactly happened. Great video and in now time it has been online! :)
Tiles fall off. Neither stage works. All for a rocket to nowhere. But the small countdown timer is nice 😂
Mainstream media are trashing the launch as a danger to our futur astronauts smh 🤦‍♂️
You are the only one who cleared almost all the doubts we had !!  Great explanation.
Thnx Marcus for this video. 1st stop was Scott Manley, you were next on the list since I didn't see anything from Tim Dodd? As usual I think you gave a balanced report without any spin! Of course, like everyone else we are all waiting for the answers re booster RUD and finally the stage 2 RUD way above the Karman line en LEO...
Yes we love what you do here my nerd friend 👌👍👍👍👍
I'm not sure that the missing tiles will be that big of an issue becasue of the stainless steel being able to take a lot more heat. That said, who knows.  Even one missing tile could spell disaster...
What an amazing moment
Are they other solutions than Thermic tiles for spacecraft cause it’s seems to me that it is  to risky for repeated flights?
And we now know the decapatated Ship 25 went on the re-enter the atmosphere shedding a flap as it went.
Very hyped, very huge
Hey hey Marcus, thanks for excellent and timely day after video. Great editing indeed. Such an exciting launch. Roll on Flight 3 in February, Eamon
it is very similar to the Soviet rocket N1, also a large mass and 30 engines from below, after four failures, the Russians abandoned this program.
They should have a configuration with a non-reusable upper stage atop the Super Heavy Booster. I don't mean version of the Starship but simply an upperstage tank with 3 Raptor Vacs and a big arse fairing. There are many things in space launch which won't fit in a Starship and doesn't need coming back down. This can be used to launch very big things -- like 10m Space Station sections, very large space telescopes or anything bulky in the 100~250 ton class. The launch cost -- assuming booster reuse -- will be in the ball park of 3 Falcon launches which is very acceptable for 100 tons of anything on a one way trip.
The engineer in me is still flipping out over the shockwaves emanating from the base of the vehicle as it "hitched it's skirt up" in preparation to leave the launch mount. Just look at the amount of visible shock waves despite that deluge system.... and still, the surrounding area seems to be mostly in one piece 😮 we just launched a stainless steel building high into the heavens and 100 odd years ago we'd only just worked out how to glue cloth over wood and fly a few hundred feet over the ground
I can't wait for a full break down of the launch site and comparisons to the last. Truly exciting times, congrats to SpaceX
Thanks, Marcus  . For such a great community.  I have listened to another's of  YouTube channels including space x live feed   How ever you maybe be the Best of all characters 😊 Well done, and thank you and all of your staff 🎉🎉🎉😅
So what your saying is not only did SpaceX make the most powerful rocket in history but Amado created an extremely effective steam cleaner at the pad
This is the kind of historical events I don't mind living through.
All 33 engines burning to separation was more than I expected. And those engines were OLD!
Great summary of the second test flight. Roll on number 3!
No. No. It was a massive failure. Early failure too. Notice the black exhaust after liftoff.
Not here, but I've seen sooo many posts online, people jumping to the conclusion that the past two Starship launches were failures simply because the ship and booster exploded mid-flight. We have front row access to these launches. It has been 51 months and 3 weeks since Starhopper's first hop. We have HD Live Streams which can be watched later. We can tweet / comment questions and get responses from those who can speak authoritatively on this topic, yet people jump to conclusions. This launch exceeded all expectations and this was THE SECOND LAUNCH. Who could ask for more?
Great update Marcus
Next time I’ll bring popcorn! Your narration/explanation kept me glued to the screen even though I already knew the ending! 😂
Fake
For a achievment that happened 50 years ago they are making look like they cant accomplish this! 😔
Absolutely amazing to see that we are actually planning to expand the human consciousness . BIG respect to elon!. May God protect that man. 😊
Glad to see you got your well earned rest, Marcus!! Haha 🍻❤️‍🔥
If ship 25 would have gone past the engine shut down and sub-orbital insertion I don't think it would have survived reentry: during the flight tiles appeared to come off leaving the body unprotected. Anyways still a great success.
why is the screen orange for the starship explosion part
Kudos to the drone pilot. Amazing footage.
massive improvement since the launch, also a reminder that a failed test launch are far more valuable than a flawless one. especially this early into the development.
So amazing!
I still think the deluge system only approach has the potential for too many problems, An upwards thrust is inevitable, and a practically incalculable amount of resonance unfolding over those few seconds. Why not suck it up and add a simple French drain for gasses to take the pressure off, there is plenty of room untouched on that spit, most of it would be underground anyway. Make it about two hundred metres long with its funnel pointing away from the rocket.
That was as exciting as I had hoped!
Thanks for your info update, Marcus. I watched the launch live, but I'm still very interested in knowing the results. It's great news to know the Orbital Launch Pad is still  virtually unscathed, with only minor repairs necessary to make ready for the next test launch.
"Big improvement" is very kind, but not true. Both components failed again. Small improvement would be more accurate. Fear not though. That rocket garden has ready and waiting volunteers standing at attention hoping they will be taking a leap of faith December 24, 2023.
Great summary, thanks Marcus!
Supper 🎉
At least this time they have a lot of data to work through. No doubt that the 3rd test will be the charm!
Superb report. Lots of good data and accomplishments.
Thanks for this excellent review. I was surprised they didn’t do any kind of press conference, but it’s still SpaceX.
After we have beome so familiar with this Starship itteration it is sad to see it cease to exist in moments.I bet even the coldest, rational, logical people who worked on it must get a feeling of loss in the pit of their stomach to see it go boom.. Hope the wheel out another one quick to help all with the mourning process!
4 large roller bearings...
Between Marcus and Scott to comment never disappoints 🇦🇺🤙
Well done Marcus. By the way, the Labpadre voice over / commentary was so much better than Nasaspaceflight. Nasaspaceflight had some good camera shots but their chat is mostly quite annoying "fanboy" populist stuff.  They have Adrian who knows his stuff but the overall tone is cringeworthy.  Hope your channel will continue as is and not copy them.
So S25 just flew away into space?
was awesome seeing you on NSF yesterday.
They hit the firmament prove me wrong.
SpaceX making history again....stoked to see what happens nxt...
This launch was night and day compared to the first one.  It was an epic launch.
I had a blast, seeing that beast going up. Probably see this event about 20 times now, including the live coverage. The mind boggles! Love to see the bright white engines with that metalox fuel.
what a beautiful site it was! great video
Finally someone with common sense to provide feedback on the launch…
Hey, just wondering, where did you get that mini starship model next to the Saturn V one. Looks awesome
Ots awsome the spacex team will get it
Hey! Hey!  Marcus is back.
Theory: Right after the hot stage, you can see the booster velocity drop by 60-ish instantly, which may have caused the fuel to slosh forward, therefore causing engine relight issues. Edit: The LOX levels on ship 25 dropped by a bit mid-flight, which could've been a leak.
Eveything went perfectly (except perhaps with the heatshield tiles) with the lift off and the hotstage seperation. Still much work to do, but they are getting close to try landings.
Well done on getting this video out so quickly, Marcus. Great work as always. What an event! I was screaming like a baby. Especially at that epic booster explosion!
Thanks Marcus!  Finally saw that the FTS on 2nd stage seem to have ignited, didn't notice it on live streams. Even wonder if it was noticed by many SpaceX employees, since there was confusion on their live stream. Also awesome you were on NSF!
Sabotage is a possible fact.
1:30 flap test of booster 25?
Where is booster 10 and ship 28 at?
Elon Musk trained his minions well to call these explosions "Huge successes". Yeah, some things went better than last time. On the other hand, not a lot more could have gone wrong and it would have been a catastrophe.
Hi Marcus, I don't know if you have seen the report by reuters about the working conditions at SpaceX. All the the glory from this launch aside, this was a big downer for me. You as a journalist should definitely report about this as well, to not only praise SpaceX but also show the price the workers have to pay for this rapid devolvement speed with serious injuries, amputations and death. As much as I don't want this do be true, it unfortunately is.
That separation event was incredible 😮
what a great day for space. those drone shots are fabulous, we need a whole "team" of drones to follow the next starship - or a drone that can do 17000 MPH. great coverage from NSF 8:00 dies it have to flip? isn't it pointing in the right direction when it separates anyway? scott manly was suggesting that it suffered fuel sloshing from the flip.
FAA now knows that the flight termination  system is working nominally .
1:28 booster 25 ? 😂
I think the acoustic vibrations of that massive beast could likely destroy it near every time.  In the end this could turn out to be a complete lemon.
Great video, we got to see a great launch and progression of starship towards space travel.  I love how you touched on and commented on each of the key points comparing to launch one.  It really shows how much has improved for the better.
Hot staging won’t work. It’s obvious. It damaged both booster and orbiter. Reusability and hot staging are simply not compatible. Sorry…
Hey hey!
Thanks for the summary! ❤️
Test flights are done to TEST craft and equipment for further refinement. This flight was a huge success in gathering the data for this purpose and any delays while getting on with the next launch will be necessary to address component failures in the test craft. Congrats to SpaceX to the giant strides they are making toward the future of reusable boosters and spacecraft. Thank you for the coverage Marcus and crew. "Data gathered is Knowledge expanded".
How do you say that all the universe.  It exists without anyone's intervention, that everything becomes alive from water, and you can know that, search if you want.  The human mind is in his skull.  And the skull and its function of protection, and the heart and its function of blood transfusion, and other than that are all these details. Have you not thought about the creation of this great creation? Why do you say we were monkeys?  The monkey said I will evolve, build ships, build skyscrapers, invent medicines, speak multiple languages, and invent an airplane.  And a car and so on.  God Almighty preferred us over those who were created from animals, so He made us understand this. Ask me any question related to the article, and I will answer it, God willing.
Imagine how long fixing the grid fins would have taken ULA.  (And what they’d have charged the taxpayer for doing it).
The second IFT was phenomenally better than than the first one when you consider what they had to do after the first one, repairing stage 0, improving the booster, all in just 6 months. Also, they didn't have any data about the ship on the first one, they didn't know how it would behave after its separation, now they have the data to work with, and I hope the next launch will be fully successful 👍🏻
Hey Marcus 😊
ELON MUSK HATES JEWS ! CHECK WHAT HE SAID ON X !
I strongly suspect that the conclusion of this flight was a "RID" not a "RUD". The FAA is now convinced that the FTS works well. Two triggers of the FTS in a row at or near critical flight conditions?  You could not plan better, two maximal conditions as ideal test demonstration points.  What are the odds they happened unplanned? The net result is that a bureaucratic obstacle has been minimized opening the future for a more intense test schedule.  Whether a "RID" or an actual "RUD", the effect is the same.
Fantastic thank you Marcus 😌🔥🔥
Thank you for your commentary during yesterday's launch at LabPadre's Live stream👍🏻  Had been looking around for professional commentary amidst the numerous amateur streams. Yours made it all come alive👍🏻
Thanks for all the happy detail.  😎
It was such a good day! Loved all the hype-up coverage and it was a bonus seeing you on the NSF coverage too. It does me good to see all you experts out there working together to give people like me the experience of a lifetime. What did you think of SpaceX comparing the size of the full stack with Godzilla? I was laughing so hard :D Very curious to hear about the technical reports coming in the coming weeks, and especially hoping you were right that they could/should be ready to do a next text in a month. Thanks, Marcus!
The fact that it worked as well as it did for as long as it did is awesome. It was such a wildly successful test. I'm super curious about the state of the pad, myself. If it's mostly intact, it should really improve the launch cadence going forward.
Thanks Marcus, nice video
Hey Marcus, I really appreciate the second episode this week breaking down the latest launch. I was cheering out loud in the living room when I saw the hot stage separation! How cool was that!!
Thanks, I was expecting the best Starship video from you, and I was not disappointed. To the point, and just enough detail. What a superb flight, if only they’d created a proper pad for the first flight. So much went right this time.
As always, welll done Marcus.  Scott Manley also has a detailed analysis of the launch that I found informative, for those who can't get enough of that kind of thing.
most of people are so blind. B9 rotated upside down, so it got Ftsed.
Thanks Marcus for the detailed explanation. . Much appreciated
It was fantastic to see you appear on NSF's coverage. 👍
Awesome moment in the history of space flight, and watching Marcus on the NSF live stream in the lead-up was just icing on the cake!
Great result
Why is everything in metric? Let the rest of the world calculate metric. I'd like to see miles/hr and gallons. Great video as always Marcus!!!!!!!!
Wow what a flight it was! Thanks Marcus and the team!
What a launch
At 4:26, what a spectacular and memorable view....!
I missed the live launch, thank you marcus for this update :)
Those epic shockwaves at launch, wow!
The booster engines that failed were all adjacent. Which makes me wonder if something came loose and started damaging the engines around it....
Came here to see the pad. So glad it's looking ok
Hey hey. Quite a day yesterday. Flight 2 was much better than flight 1, progress is being made. Like bazoo 513, I think hot staging might be a problem. Hot staging has only ever been used with non reusable rockets. Might be a problem with reusable boosters. Hopefully space X does a test flight without hot staging to compare it with flight 2.  Fuel slosh and fuel hammer are a  probable cause of the problem with booster. Causing problems with booster fuel line plumbing and fuel starvation to the engines.
Was I the only one who saw the official SpaceX stream taken over by a cryptocurrency message? Nobody is talking about it and SpaceX removed the live stream.
Finally second flight already happen ...now wait for the third flight
Thanks, Marcus.  I count  on you for all the Staw Base news and the challenges of getting to Maws
1:27 “Booster 25”😅
Long way to go but at least it didnt utterly distroy the launch pad.
I am speed MarcusHouse upload day is a good day
The fact that the 33 Engines still running after taking off the Launchpad is an amazing feat itself. Glad to see the Water Deluge system is working well
Why does future moon star ships have to be refueled when other ships have been and are going to the moon without refueling
HAY HAY
This has been quite the day! 🙏🚀🎉
497 and counting!
6th
5th!
3rd
Last
Not first 🎉
Thanks for the super quick analysis, Marcus! 😊
(First 😀)  Very good overview. However, I think that hot staging was the root of SuperHeavy demise: if one looks at the velocity numbers, one would see that SH was slowed down quite abruptly when SS pushed away. _That_ could have been the cause of all kind of bad things happening in its fuel system,.
