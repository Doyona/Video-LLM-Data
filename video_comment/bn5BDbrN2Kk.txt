🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Think of it…. The Original Captain in Original Sin, Dokes, Miguel Prado, LaGuerta, Deb, and soon….Angel. Dang, Dexter done killed nearly all of Miami Metro 😂😂😂
And our favorite killer is back!!
Say it with me y'all, "Tonight's the night"
Episode 106?
Tonight's the night baby
This is the first series ever which has not disappointed its fans with a  SEQUEL.   GO DEXTER GO ! 🩷
dexter keeps making me want to come back for more, one of the best written tv shows ever.
I can t stop smiling watching this
80% of serial killers in the last 20 years are not White and yet everyone in here is White... I wonder what kind of propaganda you're pushing
OMG Angel is gonna be so dead
DOAKES CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY FROM IT!!!!
what do you mean by episode "106" ???
Batista let it goooooooooo
Yup Batista is gonna end up on the table
I went from liking angel to utterly despising him as a character.. 🙄
How he gonna put this on Dexter he wasn't at the hotel. Im into the feel of the show so far
Im missing 101 episodes I think
Yoooooo we def need multiple season renewals paramount!!!!!!!!
I love this show hope theres tons of seasons im hooked rewatched dexter many times
Prater knows who Dexter is.
Uma Thurman looks fabulous. 🔥
Bluds added 3 diffrent dexters to showtime europe but didnt add the latest one, thanks
Yeah I'm sorry but Batista needs to go 😭
Fuck yeah lets see more season its awesome
in the helicopter scene i dont think its gonna be gemini's twin he sees, i think its gonna be blessing (the new york ripper). since this scene from the "inside the series" video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhVK3BgcSiI - 0:13 which seemingly shows blessing looks to take place during the same day in seemingly the same weather and dexter is wearing the same jacket in both clips and it also makes for compelling narrative.
Batista is about to get LaGuerta'd
cmon drop sneek peek already 😅😅😅
we saw this few days ago, nothing new in this clip?
Where the show made its 2 greatest mistakes is 1. When they killed off Doakes, instead of giving him life without parole as bhb, which would keep him in the Dexter universe as a constant threat. He would keep saying Dexter is bhb but no one would believe, but at least we would have this magical antagonism as a background noise. And now Batista would finally believe him and he would be motivated not only to cqpture Dexter, but also to free Doakes. 2. When they killed off Brian.  Those were 2 most interesting connections Dexter had, both gave us a unique look at Dexter, and both got killed off early on. In general, while this season is good, I feel a bit of dread because literally everyone he knew is dead.
If him and Harrison don’t stay okay I’m gonna flip lol
Man they're killing it this season!!! 😁
🔥 This keeps getting better
Question for my fellow Dexfanatics: being that mr Eric King has aged so incredibly well.. Would you approve or disapprove of him reprising his role in Original Sin? I would love to see mr Eric King play Doakes in original sin😁
Gemini killer will be the great villain in this season ? He looks awesome with a plot twist...
It's obvious that after Bautista tells the detective that Dexter killed Brian Foster and set up mia for it and they go to question her as they arrive at the jail the guard stops them cause they just found her dead by ( suicide ). And Dexter will kill the Gemini killer after stalking him and then at the end of the episode when they fly on the chopper Dexter will be surprised to see Gareth there realizing that Gareth has a twin . And that is why Dexter tells himself ( how did I not see this coming ). And that will end the episode!!!!!
It doesn’t make sense the bay harbor case was closed. I’d be getting a lawyer and sue Batista for harassment that part doesn’t make sense in the show
rapunzel killed harrison's girl bro..
106 niceee
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Episode 106?
It kinda sucks that they are making us hate Batista now… one of my favorite characters ever
I'm going to have to miss this one since I canceled my subscription to Paramount Plus because of the fascist collaborators who run it decided to cancel Colbert.
God damn it Batista stop being bastardo!
Welp, RIP to Batista
Damn😢😢😢god i hope dexter doesn't have to kill batista
Pure talent. No words
Batista is about to get the *table* bro. But for real I hope he lets it all go when he figures out the truth and lets Dexter go begrudgingly
Omg so I went to NYC in like February and they were filming it in the lobby and across the street at the Empire Hotel and I asked what they were filming and they said Dexter but I didn’t know Dexter was this big lol I’m so honored to have been in such close proximity with those actors
I really wonder what happened to Astor and Cody?
I waiting for Batista to get on the Dexter train, I think Dexter will end up saving him this season.
this show is elite
is this real @@
Batista will find out about Dexter but I believe the New York Ripper will kill him. Prater is 100% the New York Ripper that detective is looking for
Angel is going to end up on Dexter's table next if he keeps poking the bear
Dexter Dexter Dexter Dexter Dexter
0:21 so we already know Dexter is gonna kill someone so will it be Gemini or perhaps another?
this show is so fucking good again. i have so much trouble waiting each week atm. xD
Yeah, Batista's gonna die 100%
This season is SooOo great (so far) but...after Original Sin....I gotta have a Brian series that chronicles his departure from Miami, his journey through Med School and what leads to him officially becoming The Ice Truck killer...🤯🥶🥶🥶
how this promo get leaked before 3-4 days ago?
It's gonna be a Daredevil vs Dexter
Pure talent. No words
its like 10th time batista saying he is haunted by the case
The jump in quality from New Blood to Resurrection is mad considering we're only 5 episodes in. You notice it straight away. Dexter is BACK, baby! La Pasión.
Keep em coming...
They need to make 10 seasons at least please.
Let it go La Passion!
Just when I thought this whole Ryan Foster situation was over 😭🤦🏽‍♂️
We need more seasons
Honestly, the Batista presence in new blood being continued now is definitely making this sequel a lot more interesting. We definitely need another masuka and quinn link up. Even as a flashback. Episode 4 of resurrection might have been the best episode of the whole world of dexter and thats saying something, shit is well written.
Angel is Lundy MK2 confirmed
Batista doesn't have any concrete evidence on Dexter but I'd imagine Batista going after Harrison and using him to get Dexter which isn't going to end well 🥲
Mia about to get the Epstein treatment 😅
Ain't pony tail guy gonna be the next one to die
When he said 'why kill in pairs', it reminded me of Dexter killing that horrible couple who trafficked people in a scrap yard or something. I think he was weirdly fascinated by their love for each other.
they gettin her outta jail i see
Algorithm finally did something right
For dexter to kill lowell and setup mia that quickly in the way he did is way too stupid. Why are they so desperate to write dexters character like he is a dumbass   Oh thats right its called woke
Besides the lady detective being extremely annoying. She'd get slapped fast in real New York looking and talking to people the way she does.
Dexter will kill Gemini in episode 6, then at end of episode Gemini will join the helicopter trip, being geminis twin brother. Not seeing there were 2 killers killing together.
STOP TEASING ME
I feel like I'm being gaslit into thinking this show is any good.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
I wanna see Batista discover that Deb is actually the one who killed Maria. He thinks he's got it all worked out, but he really has no idea.
Everything is best, we need 8 more seasons of dexter
Please, no ghost Dexter for Harrison in season 2!
rest in peace my g batista angel.........,.,...........
La pasión vs. Dark Passenger.
00:04 spoiler warning!!
I think this series needs to end Harrison reuniting with his brother and sister, they need to know he's alive, right?
batista is fucking pissing me off. he was fine with dexter killing oliver saxon but now wants to be all high and mighty. doakes killed horrible people and batista was fine with it. i know it’s mostly because of laguerta and deb and rita but batista is just being a thorn in the side right now
Omg Dexter's going to have to kill Batista 😭   Let it go, Angel!!
Amazing season so far. Kudos to all involved.
I loved Angel in all 8 season. I just don't want to see angel trying to show picture of Dexter to MIA a SERIAL KILLER just to get to Dexter. Dexter literally draining out all the garbage of human world and people here trying to stop him for their dumb high moral ground never sat right with me. Bigger Good trumps all
Dude Batistas starting to piss me off
im excited for episode 106
There's a big part of me that thinks Masuka is gonna be the one to bring Dexter down - whether it's season 2 or 3..
When they said they were doing Dexter spin-offs I groaned really loud.  So far all three of them have been fantastic.  Beyond my expectations.
Heres my idea may not be true but a theory Season 1 is about Harrison, Red, Mia, Gemini Killer, and a little of Prater. Season 2 - The Real Gemini Killer, and Rapunzel, Season 3 - Prater and Dexter Arrested Season 4 - Harrison helps Dexter escape and 3 new killers escape from prison. Season 5 - Prison Killer 1 and 2 Season 6 - Return of Batista and Prison Killer 3 - Season 7 - Return to Iron Lake and Miami. Just a theory but be cool to see
Is it me or do most ppl think there's a chance will get more then 1 season of Dexter Resurrection?
We need another season of this. Last episode introducing the new york ripped?
0:19 yeah…..I bet their finding out Mia is dead right here.
and don't get me wrong, I like the guy as a fun character, but why is he Sherlock Holmes all of a sudden?  I guess if you're new to dexter than its no biggie, but if you watched OG Dexter back in the day, it doesn't make much sense.
this guy Batista is dead bro
I can totally see how tihs is gonna flip around on Angel and every single person he has contacted about his theory will think that he's absolutely insane for even suggesting it by the end of the season (and he'll probably die then as well lol (I love Batista, but considering everything that seems like the only outcome))
Batista needs to go.
Let's hope it is unlike New Blood where it all started to slip away after mid-way in the season. Everything was rushed and the end was a total crash! I pray that doesn't happen again.
The Bay Harber Butcher has haunted Bautista?  The guy was a willfully blind clown throughout the original series?  Now he wants to be a serious cop?
episode 106 is so W
Bautista is not playin no games! Love it
Ok so that detective is gonna show Dexter to Mia. Mia is gonna tell prater
You guys gotta release this sooner ha, another page gets all the views
Here before the title error is fixed.
🔥🔥🔥
Nothing new... was available after ep 5.....
0:15 Dexter killed what?.
I can’t wait until Friday!!!! Is it weird that I fall asleep to Dexter? 🤣🫣
Bautista gonna die or something bad will happen
Nice
Oh crap the detective lady is in prison question Lady Vengeance and the security stopped her
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man, Batista was cool but he's getting under my skin like bro let it go. Raton lolol
This episode is gonna be so peak
TBH, Batista is starting to piss me off.
WASN'T EXPECTING FOR BATISTA TO DO THAT, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS SEASON IS ABOUT TO KILL HIM?
SIGMA DIXTUH 😃
I hope the detectives dismiss Bautista's claim. If not, this show is gonna suck with everyone knowing who the Bay Harbour Butcher really is.
I mean…. Batista!!! Back off man lol
It just gets better and better!😀
wow
It’s the same exact promo we’ve already seen why tf they upload this?😂
I was rooting for Baptist but now it doesn’t seem like he will be around forever
I imagine the flight they're taking is to Miami. Mia had too of told Charlie about him living most his life there. I think Prater and Charlie will figure out he's the butcher, but it will be too late.
Damn they kinda spoiled that someone dies in this episode
Next season? Dexter in Seattle!
This is the Moment that bay harbour butcher released 100 episodes to save harrison.
I wonder what Prater has to show them on the helicopter?! Maybe some massive billboard
SOMEONE NEEDS TO LEAK THE EPISODE OR I WILL KMS
Batista is the only one not knowing Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Both dexter and harrison should move to India 😂😂. Police wont even bother to investigate and mark all the m%rders as $uicides
I hope he finishes Angel.
oh boy
damn they messed up the title of this video
Dexter Resurrection is awesome!!! I can't wait to see episode 6. My boy Dexter has to figure out how to deal with all these humans.  TERRANCE OUT
it's funny how the circle of serial killer super friends is getting smaller since the bay harbor butcher arrived.
Dexter is really interesting show❤
Oh Angel no
batista getting slimed this season
Damn, I didn't know there were already over 100 episodes of Resurrection.
BRO DEXTER HAS COME A LONG WAY AND ITS STILL PEEK
TV Promos had this up last Friday.  I mean it’s cool that you want to upload it too it’s your show and all but…I was hoping for something new.  Guess I’ll just have to look forward to Thursday’s sneak peek 😕
LA PASION

This is dumb the promo has already been out.
