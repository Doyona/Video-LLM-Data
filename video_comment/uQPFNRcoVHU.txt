I've played this patch for 2 hours https://twitch.tv/karq and it's actually way better than expected. You get ZEN SKIN drops for watching 12 hours on twitch come!!
The update that ruined everything.
Did they....  **checks notes**  BUFF GENJI??!!!!
God damn this game really went to shit😂 I ain't downloading that ever again
I'm was so confused. I haven't played after season 8 and then suddenly died as Kiriko when I was sure that I hit two head-shots. I could swear it was always two and thought I was going crazy or that they nerved her damage but seeing those changes, it's just because everyone's health got higher. It was already hard enough to hit two head-shots, now I need two and a body shot lovley.
Dude really wanted to meet the 10 minute minimum video by letting us know that the ultimate cost is getting a 10% increase
Stupidest changes ever the HP buffs in particular. Many heroes that were able to save themselves with a last resort 1shot combo are no longer viable. I’m a Junkrat main and that combo was extremely useful. Now it’s ruined. Blizzard can’t balance their game for shit
Sup
I’ve never watched your channel before but am returning to overwatch just play with some friends. Great editing, great mic quality, and excellent presentation; loved the video, and thank you!
old ow players watching thier game die along the updates
like orisa and dva weren't a pain in the ass enough
lol just realized that when bastion has his lego skin on, the flash from his gun shows a lego fire piece extending from the tip of his barrel instead of just his normal flash.
how are you testing the projectile sizes at 3:22?
so the main differences are that projectiles are bigger, passive healing, more health, and the new dps passive, ultimate cost, and the pharoh rework
Wtf did they do to doom? I can´t jump after punching to gain more distance and it feels/looks so buggy. Why is noone mentioning/talking about this?
Still no bans for the Xim cheaters? Urgh. Its impossible to reach GM on console without cheating, it's so unfair.
dang no wonder people been hitting their shots a lot
No hero or map is biggest update?
Hey Karq, love your contents! Will you do a crosshair video for all heroes now that there are plenty of options?
For mythbusters:  If you copy a non-dps as echo, do you still get dps bonus?
There just shouldn't be any role passives. Makes playing the game so uncreative. Tanks still need to just be a sponge. DPS deal damage but are glass cannons. Healers can only heal and nothing else. Just do away with role passives all together.
If 4 classes get kpop skins, i want Rammstein skins for Reinhardt, Reaper, Ramattra and Mauga?/Junkerqueen?
Junkrat crying in the corner, as a rat main rat is useless now
Even on switch this was a 25gb "update"
What is the purpose of blue health when everyone can now regen hp out of combat?
I used to play as Zen, Doomfist and Moira. They still worth playing? It’s been years
Ngl 3:55 doom only having 525 hp does not make up for the insane projectile buff they have this season
I guess I don't need good aim anymore as Widow, what is the point of playing ;-;
So if you're Bronze 5 like me where do you start? - Bronze 5 rank and division? ;D
So we not gonna nerf mercy but we re work parah, blizzard honestly afraid if they nerf her their playerbase will down to 100, also what next soldier rework cause he was pocketed by mercy and unstoppable?
Why tf would they take my comp points away
Still making the only relevant OW2 videos. thanks bruh
You said Reinhardt’s hammer damage will increase from 85 to 100, but in the patch notes you mentioned all melee damage would increase from 30 to 40 excluding Reinhardt & Brigitte. Does “excluding” mean they don’t get a damage buff or that their damage buffs are greater or lesser than 10 (based on the 85 to 100 buff to Reinhardt, Im assuming the latter)?
Why is this game still being talked about? It's dead
Now WHY would dmg and tank regen health
So they game will be easier?
I cnt even find a compi match it took 50 mins and still counting. Unranked matches are easy to find
I stop play this game cuz I get really. Bored from all change each season they try to Rez the game
Ow 1 heroes rework are a joke
They finally ruined Pharah, I'm done with this game.
whats even the point of buffing everyones health if all the damage is upped equally to make up for it? doesnt this change do pretty much nothing then  ok i investigated more ig not all abilities damage are increased and autos are still same dmg so basically durability patch ha ha ha
Why can’t you just use centimeters
Its Joe-ver! 😢
The Pharah rework is probably the best thing to come out of this update other than the self heal for all heroes
I miss Overwatch 1
That 20% heal reduction on damage is brutal. I’ve gotten more flame while playing support in the last few days than I have since ow2 dropped. Teams meet on the point and it’s a blood bath, everyone’s on red and you can’t get tank sorted fast enough, tank dies, dps dies, team flames healer diff. This shits stressful af.
Ok, the reduced the skill ceiling massively, they really hate their own game
Weird the passive changes remind me of another game ....
My baby pharah......😢
wth is wrong with them by increasing projectile size, isnt random headshot already been annoying?
They gave everyone more health but also buffed the damage of everything so really this means nothing
I HAD 2930 COMP POINTS 😭😭😭😭
More health but More damage = balanced out so nothing has actually changed
What were the devs on when they came up with the idea of penalties for loss streaks? Punishing players for having to suffer through losses is about as much fun as rewarding smurfs for being good at smurfing.
Okay I don’t want to sound dumb but I’ll ask anyways, if we are giving everyone more health and also everyone is getting more damage does this really change anything? Maybe I’m missing something someone help 😂
Lol I was wondering how my Kunia was hitting headshots when I thought I missed
Look this is cool and all but they wouldn't fix their biggest problem, the aggressive monetization and that's why i refuse to play the game still. Its great game with great characters made by a greedy horrible company.
NAH OVERWATCH TAKING NOTES FROM PALADINS NOW
Does anyone else feel like they’re making overwatch easier or more beginner friendly?
I hate the increase in projectile size for characters like junkrat and hanzo but over all i love the changes.
i have 2975 legacy comp points im gonna cry
100 a swing from rein is crazy
Just bring back 2-2-2. This shit is getting too overbearing. This is the patch that made me quit overwatch after years of putting up with blizzards BS hopping they'd learn from the past.
I'm top500 pharah player and i hate this new patch. this is sad
did they just turned mercy and pharah into real annoying mosquitoes to fight agaisnt
Becoming paladins lmao
Overwatch 3 here we go
Ruining the game lol
I didn’t thought OW2 could get much worse with a patch. Now I can uninstall in peace
There doing ball dirty this season. Bro got the hamster feet cannons😂
U could’ve just said every character is gonna have their ultimate cost increased by 10%.  That’s it.  One time for the whole video. We will understand  You save time for you me and them
yzna in masters this season if not enough wintraders available , gj
They really out here with no idea what there doing
Anything to not bring 6v6, nerf/rework wido, and remove battle passes huh 🙄. Glad I quit this garbage
Maybe I just don't know what im doing with Pharah yet, but she feels like shit to me right now.
I feels like everytime Ana reload cost the life of a teammate.
Been a pharah main since 2019, needless to say, this is the best she has ever felt.  she feels a lot more engaging and mobile. Glad to see my girl get some love.
Season 9 is really bad.
Did they just, dumb the game down?
Everyone passive regens now? Why? What’s the point if health packs or healers? Christ they keep fucking up this game.
Everyone feels like a bullet sponge, I don't think making people MORE survivable is going to improve the game
I dont know longer knockback duration and farther i dont think thats a good combo. Plus how does one move super jump with mercy? I cant seem to figure it out. Plus with this massive change it seems they broke the crosshairs since their acting weird and not like the menu says. Lag upon the first part of the games and idk i cant land my shots or play any character. They changed so much that now its 10x harder for me than it was back than.
It would be nice if you put a overall buff/nerf in the top right or left for each hero
dude the health changes is going to take so long me to get used to  Edit: Why didn't they just reduce healing instead of buffing health and damage?
300 comp wins for a single jade weapon skin😃
I wonder if the 20% reduced healing impacts Mauga and Lifeweaver's overheal values
So many creative changes. I thought they would change the name of game to Paladins 2
this game is shit and fell off
So basically they made the game easier to play?
So pretty much nothing changed😢😢
Does the blue shield health do anything besides regen? Everyone kinda has blue health now if you think about it
GENJI GOT BUFFED IVE BEEN PRAYING FOR DAYS LIKE THIS
That Jenos skin in the thumbnail looks sick ngl
It’s so over
Lifew deserved more shield :(
Bring back over watch 1
Am I the only pharah main thinking her passive fuel recharge being taken away is a net nerf?
This is what makes overwatch more dogshit
As a pharah main, im excited to be a sky ninja from now on
Games shit now
The ultimate cost will be increased by 10%
This game realy hate suports
It seems redundant to talk about the general global changes on every single character
Overwatch has lost there mf minds
Does the DPS healing reduction stack? Never saw it mentioned.
Good to see that rien got a main attack boost and health boost. It wont help much with everyone getting a health buff and regen.
Gonna switch to Paladins, this is dumb.
Tbh this patch done Made garbage players decent and decent players good. Shit kinda made the game easier and just more annoying
Seeing Brig at 250 hp again brought back some flashbacks I wasn’t ready for
Zen'z melee with a discord now deals more than mccree's nade lol. But honestly I feel like this maj is a big nerf for supports and tanks heroes. The new dps passive is maybe a bit too much overpowered
what the fuck???? overwatch copying paladins???? what kind of mandela effect bizarro world did i wake up in?
WHAT U NEED TO WIN 300 GAMES FOR ONE JADE SKIN THATS CRAZY
Satisfied by Junker Town changes.
Wat tf is Cassidy
Is it me or your voice is kinda small? my game sounds way bigger, I need to mess with audio mix settings despite YT on max already
Twomad:
Pls convert the old CP (competitive points) currency into something I can use it up for. Sucks I saved up all these CP from over the years & can’t even use them anymore.
I HAD SO MANY COMP POINTS THAT HAVE ALL BEEN LOST 😡 😡 😡
Huge indirect buff to Widow. I've been hitting headshots a good bit more since the update. The 200 hp great too, considering you can still one shot other people.
I can't believe they just decided to turn Overwatch into Paladins with these new passives. Now everyone has out of combat healing (like Paladins), DPS get Cauterize, etc.
Shit 9season
Bless their heart they're trying.
Why did you mention the 10% ult cost for each individual hero, wasted a lot of time there.
So is there even a point in shield health anymore since everyone regenerates health now?
Phara rework is horrible. Delete it fat
So there is no more satisfying hanzo 1 shots? This is ass
What are these hitboxes lmao. Huge L
Does reapers lifesteal get affected by the healing reduction effect?
Overwatch has finally overwatched
*they still doing ball dirty*
I wonder if the 20% healing reduction from the dps stacks depending on how many people are shooting the target. Could be a cool mythbuster idea
Literally added a Jett dash from Valorant
So Hanzo arrow head went from a medium sized sedan to a bus? 🙄
What's the point of increasing damage and projectile size while also increasing health and passive healing?  Like surely they cancelled each other out a bit?
Bro this is more mf changes compared to when ACTUAL overwatch 2 game out…..
2:27 Heeeeeeck no I'm not playing this dogsh** You guys have fun being one shot over and over.
this game is slowly become paladins lmao
Let's all thank this man for going in full details on all this patch 🙌 🙏 🎉 this was alot of work
If Blizzard makes these changes properly, Role Queue and Open Queue could have identical Heroes (identical HP).
Tracers damage taken should be 175 in the doomfist section for the ult, love you karq
Increasing projectile is the worst thing a game has ever done…. Takes away all the skill of hitting shots😂😂😭
I am impressed. Every time I think they can’t make it worse, they manage to do just that. That takes skill…
Overwatch is slowly becoming Paladins
Mythbusters question: can any cleanse ability break the dps passive like bubble, suzu, wraith etc
Oh Mercy can heal MORE now... *sigh* Great...
RIP to healer supports
The paladins update
10:34 ah yes, reduced from 0.25 to 0.35
This patch sucks ass. The game feels horrible to play as half the support cast and from what I’ve heard tanks aren’t having fun either. All the supports that were broken pre patch are more so now which sucks, and damage feels even more burst like than before.
Bring back OW1
The change that’s needed is for hack not to remove wrecking ball from ball form the same as it is for other ‘form’ abilities. That quality of life change would make him playable
This is awesome, but instead of shooting the target range dummy center mass, it would have been better to see the new hitbox sizes for all heroes. You did a couple, but not all. It's difficult to even parse zero point something meters, etc. Just show us the difference.
I love the Pharah changes. I like to play low anyway.
Im already gonna guess how this is gonna go Dps are still going to find killing to be super difficult because of the increased health and supports are going to be put under more stress to heal because of two dps shoot at your tank thats basically half an ana nade constantly while  And tanks are just going to get focused die respon and get alted
But how much percent more will the Ulta cost?
I’m sorry but the projectile size increase is wild. That’s a skill issue if you like this change, just saying
Buffing all the hitboxes but won't increase tracer hp by 50 like every other dps😭
Aim assist gonna be wild💀
Did BOB'S health increase or did it stay the same?
"for widows players, always for widow playerss" well yeah, that hitscan sniper never had any business being in OW. after 8 years i consider their only true ground floor mistke lol, its just anti fun in the purest form that completely deviates from the OW design experience. THey seem to be pushing even harder to avoid the "instant death" scenarios in this patch
karq really lovin' hog's belly button
I did some testing, and I don't think Mercy's change went in. I started a timer the moment I super jump and ended it the moment cooldown is over, and I consistently get 3 seconds = 1.5 second cooldown + 1.5 second "active duration". So, I don't think they changed kt from 1.5 to 1 second.  However, if I am in Valk, then it is definitely quicker, but I can't remember if that was always the case.
My only gripe with this patch is the healing debuff that the dps can give, and not only the lack of indicators of it being active, but also the fact that it makes playing healers a lot harder, especially if you get bad team mates - and 9 times out of 10, you'll get bad team mates.  As someone who played Paladins since Open Beta - even going through the infamous OB64 - this was the only thing I did not want Overwatch to get, because healing in OW is not as powerful as in Paladins, where healers can be topped off with one single skill usage, whereas in OW it's not the case. This is why in Paladins everyone had to buy Cauterize, a passive that reduced healing by 30-60-90% (I think it was 25-50-75% before?) or else tanks were literally unkillable (nowadays it's a global passive, I think?). And unlike OW,  in paladins everyone has this passive, not just dps.  Basically, I think they should've buffed healing a little, maybe 10% more or something, so that the debuff would be punishing only if they get hit, bringing the healing down to the "old numbers", but be able to top up tanks or dps in quicker time. On top of that, this debuff makes any tank without shields a big problem and tanks like Roadhog or Wrecking Ball will definitely suffer.   I will see what's going to happen. The rest I think it's nice, but I'm just not a fan of the debuff.
The update is even called champions. Paladins 2 looks lit
Blizzard really hates widow
What difference does it make now if it is shield health or normal health, now that everyone heals over time?
they could’ve kept the tanks the same only dps and healers buffed
roadhog and mauga do no not need a buff
I wonder then will they bring just 5 placements back.
Nah they need to change the hitboxes back cuz I was confused asf how I died watched the replay and manz shot 3 ft behind me and it counted I was so pissed
Wow these changes are terrible
It’s a shame they increased the ultimate cost on my favorite hero by 10%
So roadhog is now a troll pick essentially
Honestly one of the worst updates for the game I've logged off till they fix it
I like to call it the Paladins Update
I think melee attacks should bypass the shield portion of health bars.
Why did ana have 251hp 16:19
Important to note: JUNKRAT AND HANZO CANNOT ONE SHOT ANYMORE
I wish KarQ would have said projectile GIRTH the entire video for fun.  Thickness was fun though.
So it’s a dummy version of paladins
Does anyone know if ashe's dynamite will continually proc the dps passive? With the 5 second burn duration, and the 2 second passive duration, it would effectively apply a 7 second -20% healing aoe (assuming it isn't cleansed). That sounds strong.
I love how they made accurate aiming an option💀
Greattt another buff orisa didn't need
as gm 1 atop 500 pharah , new pharah is bad!
Thank you for the time stamps bro 🙏🏽
Pharah got a terrible update. I did not even stand a chance against old Pharah.
I dont understand why so many people are shitting on the jade guns.They are literally giving us free cosmetics again. This also might mean that we are getting a new color of gold gun every season and im 100% into that. Unlikely though.
This game needs to bring 6v6 back then I will reinstall.
20:13 75 when the target is discorded. Oof
Am I the only one who thinks they kinda fucked up the hitboxes ???😅
I don't know man, don't think this is it
So it went from Overwatch 1.5 to 1.6
Upping everyone’s health doesn’t make sense to me if they were just gonna make a lot of characters deal more damage. Like is it not the same thing as before just with larger numbers in the end?? I’m dumb as hell y’all
Finally a boop buff.
still not enough to comeback to the game, we need to add 2nd tank in role of offtank
this new update is basically paladins 2
Bro pharah shoots so unreasonably fast now
Don’t say increase ult charge for every hero if u said it at the begging just repetitive and annoying
Just a idea but I think it would be cool if syms wall could also do passive damage if you stand to close to it
I would've traded Bastion's health bonus for his self-repair, but everything else about this update is pretty darn good.
mauga was already annoying enough 😭😭
im suprised they didnt buff hanzos regular arrow damage, cant even bodyshot+melee tracer now and a lot of heroes now survive a fully charged headshot
This new DPS passive makes it basically useless to play healer. Why should I bother playing healer if it's going to feel like I'm literally doing nothing while pocketing someone. It's baffling to say but I was happier as healer when people were being insta-capped and I could just go "well, there was nothing I could do" as opposed to now where people aren't instantly dying they're just getting their life force whittled away and I have to watch in horror. It also makes any tank who doesn't have a damage blocking ability basically useless, Sigma and Zarya are about the only tanks I enjoyed playing at all so far this season. Perhaps healer needs a new passive, having the auto regen slightly faster hardly makes up for the reduction in healing...
so is everything easier to matrix
now i understand why twomad did it 😢
Tracer pulse bomb doesn’t even kill bastion now lol
just add more health and damage call it a rework
I do not appreciate getting edged with the zen volley... 😢
This might be the most embarrassing patch I’ve ever seen in any video game.
So basically over watch is now paladins in terms off passives and general changes. Nice 😊
So it is slowly turning into Paladins…
No it’s like cauterize was in paladins, not a good sign 😢
Mentioning the projectiles and the ult increase for every single hero was so unnecessary.
Sounds like Hanzo got tired of fletching his arrows so thin. 😂
why would you change pharah. She was the only hero in the history of overwatxh that has always been perfectly balanced
And this is the death of the game.. they’re aiming to bring in new players but will loose vets. ✌🏽
Game is still trash. Bring back classic 6 V6 overwatch.
Aint no wayvim seeing "doom buffed" in the thumbnail hell nah
Can you do a new setting video for 2024 I wanna see what setting you use for Ram Weaver and Illari
i really dont like that the global changes are stated again while talking about each hero specifically. it drags the video way too long and hearing the same changes so 39 times is very unnecessary. i thinks it better to only state specific changes in the heroes section
Yeah 75hp for Queen And doom yeah that's fair 💀💀💀
moira mains will be so happy with the dmg buff
Ok let me make this clear, ive been playing pharah since sezon 4 ow 1 and this change copletly ruined everything i tought of this game. There is nothing for me here anymore, im glad youre having fun but after 14000 hrs im done.
Crazy how siily it is that in 2024 an fps counts a complete miss and a full damage dealing shot , feels so wrong to look at
They took away mauga’s health just to give it right back wtf is this 💀
Overall for me it just seems like hitscan dps are super strong, especially soldier. Dva is good in qp and sig is good in comp. Zen is obviously busted and I think bap can be pretty good too.
You added a section exclusively to state the global changes to heroes, then continued to mention those identical changes for every single hero afterwards....
you could release this 1 day before season 9 bad job at all
Can't wait to play like 300 or 150 comp matches for a single skin. Or 8100/4050 matches for all of the weapons. Idk know if you get a bonus 100 points after the 10 each match or not so the numbers are uncertain but im pretty sure either way you would have to no-life this game for a single skin.
I hate the healing thing, what are healers for then?
So you just don’t have to aim at people anymore, okay
Hot take: they should give supports a new passive that gives them 20% more healing as long as they don't take any damage, and taking damage from anyone from any role interrupts that passive for 3 seconds so in the end it balances with the new dps passive, so as long as the support has good positioning and is being careful they can negate the new dps passive and their tanks/the unlucky dps or support that got targeted doesn't instantly keel over and die. Idk it just seems like a lot of people don't like the new dps passive and imo it doesn't look or feel right that tanks/dps have multiple passives while support only has one which is just a buffed version of the one everyone else has.
Why hammond balls do the same dmg if everyone got more hp.  Why Winston ult dosent give 1200hp?  And why my boi rein got White HP!!!  Dumb mauga no shirt got 100 armor...
L nerf for reload speed eliminations
Is this the noob update?
Hey Blizzard. Read the feedback from players. For the most part, we arent too thrilled on this seasons rework. Junkrat, Pharah...not near as fun as before. 👎
they should’ve named this patch “for the casual babies that cried about people that could aim and 1 shot”…. jesus christ they made my 2k hours on widow worth nothing 🤦‍♂️
Bro why is Phara getting Vals Jet dash
Game feels better overall. However as a Junkrat main, no more instantkill most people with 1 Grenade+Mine, all support/dmg heros survives with about 5 hp left. Lame.
Thank you for telling us the update so simplified! ❤
With these passives they made supports even more useless 🪦
This is going to suck, they’re really throwing anything at the fan now
How is the new healing passive working with shield? Do characters with shield recover, effectively, 50hp (30 shield/sec after 3 seconds and 20hp/sec after 2 seconds), or are shields redundant now?
At 18:45 for Lucio's soundWave knockBack comparison, you used the same video (old patch) on both sides.   It's just a minor mistake on a great video, I love your patch breakdowns.👍
In the patch notes and in the season trailer it said they would give you reasons why you went up or down in rank percentage.  I haven't seen that at all, it only shows what percent I went up/down but doesn't give any of the reasons why.  Did they lie to us or am I missing something?
Leave it to blizzard to make the game worse with each season...
this many changes at once is a terrible idea for balance reasons
So aim is not the biggest deal in this new update but mind game like roster, position, counter heroes and flank will be. An attempt to close the gap between bronze and master in “Big hands” term in my opinion
Easily Gonna skip this seasons blizzard continues to shovel these shit patches what’s new 🤷‍♂️
Bro hanzo is basically irrelevant
Making Pharah, the flying character, have to not fly, is the stupidest decision ever!!! After the last nerf to her hovering, they had us relearn her hovering to make her playable only to now nullify all that work?! Relearning her with the boost cool down nerf would be annoying, but doable if the hover fuel recovered like before. Why force the flying character to have to land. Giving her horizontal movement by sacrificing her vertical movement is stupid. Every Pharah main will tell you that we'd prefer her vertical over the horizontal. A complete Nerf ( not rework) of her is what we got from the devs. Might not even play until she gets fixed...
Can anyone remind me how much the ultimate costs were increased by?
I quit playing overwatch because the heroes were bullet sponges and now you're telling me they INCREASED the health by 20%??
Why they changed everything about pharah BESIDES rocket barrage is just baffling to me
Wait so only a few character ults will be increased by 10% right?
I thought they were gonna make it so anyone could que ranked with anyone?
Oh boy genji mains will rejoice
Hey Blizzard, tell me you wish OW was more like Paladins without saying so.
So supports get a buff while dps and tanks are nerfed...   At this point they should just bring back 6v6
One important note is that Hanzo can’t one shot anything above 250 health which is a decent amount of characters.
Is that the soundtrack unfathomed force from Ao no Kiseki. Been a long time since I’ve listened to it
Finally lucio boop has been buffed 😭
No WAY they buffed Moira's annoying ah life drain bs again! They don't know what to do with this girl.
AARGE is gonna suffer af
I don't play overwatch anymore because they ruined it, but the 20% healing decrease on damage is bullshit
This is lame. you don't even need to shoot people to shoot people. You don't need a head shot to get a head shot. Just blindly fire your weapon and you're gonna hit them. Its for children now.
Give Junkrat tire more health, everything one shots it anyways and now everything hits it
How to kill a game... Overwatch 2 season 9.
I really hate to sound sexist, but I feel like a lot of these changes were done so that females can play better.
Bro this is a general nerf for all healer’s 😂
Everyone is raging at hanzo like he’s an insanely good character
WHAT ABOUT REIN’s FIRESTRIKE???? That should def go to 125!!!?
today I tried the new pharah rework, I'm a pharah main, and I think it's time to stop, I uninstalled the game and won't play it again, fuck blizzard
Garbage update
pharah will be super boring to play
How are the devs this braindead?
Gotta be genuinely some of the dumbest stuff ive ever seen added to a patch.
atp its paladin😂
Let’s be real. Winston only got a slight damage increase because everyone got a health increase. We back to square one😢
3:05 i played exactly 1 game before watching this, dva really feels a lot better now but honestly i would take both 150 baby dva health and smaller baby primary for increased air time when meched and maybe a second more on defense matrix
i hope pharah rework includes replacing her VA loll
Love the part where firestrike is still 100 dmg. So coool 🗣️🗣️
I get that they buffed Lucio a little bit to scale but they gotta up his healing as well, at this point his healing is so bad with the DPS passive. I understand his main priority is speed but also he does have the ability to heal.
If you tell us Ultimate cost globaly increases by 10% and give us a good overview about the projectile size you really don't need to repeat those for every single hero again... otherwise comprehensive video. thx
A rein charge should be a confirmed kill
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I HATE THE ULTIMATES ENERGY INCREASE AS A WIFELEAVER MAIN I HATE IT SO MUCH
GENJI DOESN'T NEED HEALING ANYMORE !!
dead game
So we ain’t reading the patch notes yall?
I might be dumb. In fact I am. But what is the point of buffing most heroes health AND dmg? Doesn’t it just end up being the same?
Huge day for the Shimada community
This season feels absolutely awful
why didnt theyjust lower everyone damage and healing seeing heroes like tracer with and genji with changed hp ammounts is so weird to me😭😭
They should just let it die. Nothing will make me play overwatch.
Thanks for sharing the link to KarQ's Twitch stream! I'm excited to watch and see the Zen skins drops.
Hanzo just firing rockets out here.
As a Pharah specialist since OW1: I am ruined. Don’t care for her synergy with Mercy, but not being able to infinitely fly!? Now THAT sucks
This is a horrible update...
Leave it to your asian friend to do all the math for you, arigato KarQ 😍
Amazing breakdown. Thank you!
Winston buffs spotted LETS GOOOO
I was holding back my comments about this patch, but after playing it, it is the worse patch ever for healers.  not only is the heal reduced on your teammates, but yourself now when dps hits you.  that means that sombra and tracer can pretty much pick you off easily now - which is happening as EVERYONE is switching over to tracer.   normally, tracer is just a fly on the wall, but now, she can burst you down so fast, and even with morias orb or ana's grenade, its not enough to sustain you against tracer due to the debuff  so while your team is fighting the front line, the support class is busy fighting the tracer - and no amount of healing will keep you alive since you generally only have 1 skill to heal yourself while your other support is trying hard to heal the other members.    Overall, this patch was a HUGE nerf to support, and a big buff to DPS.  its completely unbalance now as some characters benefits from these characters more like tracer and sombra.  I think this is the nail to the coffin as a lot of support players cannot counter these faster mobile characters that suppresses their healing ability.    for dps players, they'll love it as they literally gain the debuff ability and self heal which you can see it in reddit and at the official ow forum, but hop on over to healer's forums, and we all feel the same way about how bad the new patch is as support took the biggest nerf, not only as an individual, but as for the whole team due to 20% reduction in heals.
Lmao what are these passive changes? Paladins wanna be?
So basically everyone has more HP but is easier to hit? Sounds like they're making the game more noob-friendly. Not a bad thing.
Might actually reinstall to try the new pharah
I'm kind of baffled they gave everyone extra health but then also increased the projectile size for everyone and that new DPS passive...wasn't the idea to increase time to K and give healers more impact on the game? I was playing tank and it honestly felt like I was getting no healing, which wasn't even true, its the DPS passive.
[warning: me cry babying] I feel sad for the longer cool downs, the few games I played it didn't really make it better
Why did they do this...
being honest I hated the healing passive for everyone
I was already a ridiculously aggressive Pharah. There's no stopping me now. 💀👹💀👹💀👹💀👹💀👹
Lets gooo hanzo buff
For the placement games, are they solo or can they be done in teams?
What is the difference between shield and armor?
Pharah rework more like a nerf and conversion to junkrat mode
This is the worst update I have ever seen.
Couldve done a better job showing the projectile size difference imma be honest. Shooting a hog right in the middle doesnt show us anything
Ew to them buffing Moira's attack. She's already got an obnoxious range.  On the bright side, it sounds like they aren't messing up my main three (Wrecking Ball, Soldier and Mercy) too much.
Phara becomes more and more like drogoz
What’s the point of shield health if everyone can self heal?
I just don't get it, why to incrise the hp but up the consistensy of damage? it is the same thing nothing changes if you have more hp but everyone lands more shots also the numbers are getting so out of hand, hog with 800 hp is so stupid high was a very simple fix, lower the damage, lower the healing, keep the hp the same, that all they needed to do
I usually read patch notes for every game's update that I play but chose not to for this one. Hopped on my first game for Soldier and thought it was a special mode because he had 250 health and felt easier to hit lmao. Weird but cool update
The competitive points shit seems so unnecessarily complicated.
I been playing since ow1 and I'm still playing ow2 even when everyone left and started hating on the game,  I truly love overwatch, it was always there for me.
still not sure how you don’t have a pop filter, love hearing every single sound your mouth makes
Rip tracer and Winston😢 the two heroes that when they are good the game is good
Overwatch 3 before GTA 6?
Thanks for breaking this down bb!  Did Brig’s whipshot not get a damage and/or projectile size buff?
I love how we keep on making the immortal horse even more immortal 🫠
Genji: I need.....wait a second :0 *Hides in bush to regen*
This is literally paladins now
The "should be increased by" is giving similar vibes to "allegedly did xy" when talking about a criminal while the trial is still ongoing
Damn, OW3 out so soon?
Why dah fk did they perform kiriko again brahhh 😤😤😤
we got power creep in overwatch before gta 6
so many players complain so much they increase the bullet sizes so people can hit things sad world we live in lol
yay time to die to random hanzo arrows even more!
It's ballover
I’m so excited to play the new “I can’t aim and I can’t find heal packs” update
Ultimate costs are increased by 10% but if theres 15-20% more health pools to farm then surely we'll be getting more ults overall?
I feel that being able to hit a head while aiming clearly far off the enemy will break DPS.  Why even call this a shooter game if you can miss by a mile and still head shot?
Oh hey, they found yet another ways to heavily nerf Widow : give EVERYONE huge hp boost and hp regen as well as deleting all of her sightlines...  ...as if she wasn't rock-bottom enough, now they're going for below-bedrock...
Damn this was an extremely thorough season 9 update. Thank you!
Wait how much is the ult cost increased by???
The game feels like a baby game now 😂 You hit every shot and have more health. Feels like I’m playing halo where everyone takes 15 shots to kill. Everyone also has ultimates every minute. gm feels bizarre now…
Whats with the new healing loop? Isn't that why they got rid of most shields by nerfing them to the ground  even making orisa a dps? Matches used to be shooting shields non stop and now its the same loop but with all the healing boosts. And 800 health for the pig? There goes the value of an ult cos that's just gonna tickle him after he heals and gets healing. I hate him hahahah 😂 I really do! 😢 but anyways I'm still excited!!!!!
overwatch 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Increased Health and increased damage… just sounds like inflation
Does Ashe's dynamite trigger the passive on herself?
12:54 is it bugged for me or what? cuz my fuel didnt regen after barraging.
Increased health + increased projectile size = friendlier to new players Decrease in ult charge gain = longer matches Passive healing for all = reduce toxicity
Overwatch stealing from paladins lmao
It’s awful now, a lot of characters feel useless
Text is a little small sometimes but great video
Buffing storm arrow damage but not helix rocket is so lame
For me, the lower aim requirement sucks. You land shots without the need to place your crosshair on the target only close to it ... 😢. Ok,  it was not that precise before but required a little bit more effort.
Karq you could have at least made some kind of joke how ball gets no love. Ball is useless this season and i'm a ball main that has peaked at gm3. The game has never felt worse
So more damage and less healing. Just get rid of support role, they clearly keep working towards it.
ye so ball rework was needed before this season. I'm a ball main and i'm completely frustrated with this season only after one day. Feels like i'm completely useless. Basically the game feels awful currently
To my knowledge, you can still buy golden guns with regular competitive points. Not necessarily vaulted
ty for explaining 'net change' for some of the 'nerfs'
Junkrat was a fun and good character… R.I.P
Genji is better again. I waited so long for this!
so they turned pharah into echo?    Also no buffs for my boy ball😢
I missed it, how much is Ana’s ult cost going up by?
as a reinhradt main i am here to ask why overwatch ahtes us...
Is Mercy's new self healing passive enough to out pace the damage of Ash dynamite or Sombra virus?
this is just wayy too much for 1 patch imo
Playing tank is awful now
this update made me and my friends quit the game 😁
LETS FUCKING GO GENJI IS UNPLAYABLE NOW WOOOOOO (im going to nuke overwatch)
Damn Bastion grenade will have the size of Moira orb now !
That +25 on baby DVA has saved me a few times on re-mechs lol
Oh god, the 2018 shield shooting meta is back, except now it's just every single hero who is impossible to kill. I can't wait for a baby dva to eat a nanoblade
Tbh I haven't launched OW in more than 5 years but still occasionally watch some videos that you put out for old times sakes
Junkrat can no longer two-shot any 250HP dps, considering as the biggest nerf to him
This 14 sec cooldown on Pharah is mad. What are they on?
really big update
Been a pharah main since 2019, needless to say, this is the best she has ever felt.  she feels a lot more engaging and mobile. Glad to see my girl get some love.
I wonder which is prioritized, head shot or body shot?
Junkrat now is a dead hero.
Genji got healing after 8 years.  Jokes aside tac visor and death blossom should do more damage now. Either duration or dps. And pharah should have the ability to cancel her ult in the middle
Entertaining and well made video. Thanks a lot!
Hanzo is dead. Headshots is dead
im mad… i saved 33k gold weapon points but now it seems to be capped at 20k max… 13k comp points are gone w/o any replacement… wtf is this blizzard?!!
i feel like overwatch is becoming more like paladins
buff cass
May god have mercy on the supports souls
Ah Nice Widows Dmg Dropoff will make it cancer to kill all the hp buffs, same with pea shooter Tracer
I do not get this. Increase all hp of all characters. Increase all dps from all characters.  How is that an update? Scale everything up and call it an update....  Just the 0.05 projectile increase is stupid imo.
The Paladins Patch.
I think that the jet dash should only be used in the air
I'm still surprised Moira hasn't been converted to a DPS yet
Nah Cassidy's health should only go up to 250 considering how good he is amongst the other dps
Oh wow finally a dps passive that actually has an impact on the game Poog
10 points per win so about 300 wins for that ugly green color. Nice!
Idk why they randomly nerf phara air time. It was perfectly fine for 6 years. Now it feels like she can't even fly. Plus the new projectile buff all the heroes that used to have a hard time hitting her are hitting her a lot easier. Stupid
i quit playing a while ago, but i’m so confused why the projectile size increase is necessary? i don’t remember ever struggling to hit shots with him 😭
I think this update is just a huge nerf widowmaker because of the health increases. Before you would charge up 67% too deal 200 damage, but now that doesn’t even kill a normal support. I mean she can still oneshot but the projectile size increase of the shots, the fall off damage(from previous nerfs) and health increases(on all squishies) just makes Widow feel less skilled, slower and takes away the “precise sniping” part of her kit. But that is just my opinion
19:55 "Targetcquisition"
The new patch is awful, no one is ever dying.
Why make projectiles bigger? You're basically not even hitting the enemy now and you're still hitting him bruh
i hate this game more and more every update
I didn't see this mentioned in the video, but illari's captive sun is a projectile. Which buff is it getting .05, .10, or .15?
Played since the beta of OW1, to me the game officially sucks as of this update
The 50 hp health up is really gonna do genji dirty not being able to easily 1 shot healers with like tp or shadowwalk type of abilities anymore
this game shits the bed worse every day also They just copied Paladins
The quality of the video is so good, as always. BUT, the fact that you put the link of the patch note in the description is god like for me, why so many content creator don't do that...
I'm on 2900 legacy competitive points, looks like I will have to wait until the end of the year to get another gold weapon.
bullshit game, bullshit update, bullshit director, who does not play the game at all.
Deserved for playing Pharah
I outdamage and heal every Moira as lifeweaver since that patch it’s insane
yeah so ngl this ruins all the breakpoints.... like bruh zen is boutta live two slashes and a dash from dragon blade
bro looks like oj ( orange juice clash royale )
Idk about those "big swings" for placement games. It just seemed like the ow1 placement games to me. Just worst quality games where either you steamroll or get steamrolled only to be placed around where you finished last season. I finished plat 4 on supp last season and placed top of plat 5. Also, I haven't seen any of those end game modifiers either during my placements or the games after. Bar just go up 🤷🏾‍♂️
Wow Moira buff 😊😊 genji here I come!
So, finally, which size of kunai does Kiriko have now? I didn't get it :( 0.18 -> 0.15 + 0.07 = 0.22? Or 0.18 + 0.07 = 0.25? Which is right?
Poor roadhog.
Sooooooo all tanks got a damage increase…… We still think it’s okay for tanks to be the role with the highest consistent damage on top of all their cc and damage reduction abilities?   NICE we aren’t learning at all here
Wayyyyy too many changes...
i feel like echo will now take over the sky after this pharah rework
Ill have to grind ranked to get weapons now... Ive been living off of end of season rewards
If OW wants to update something to make me happy, it would be the characters that don't take damage from their OWN explosives, should. It's never sat right with me that Junk and Dva get away with murder by standing inside their own explosion radius. There are too many characters that DO hurt themselves to not justify this change in my opinion. I know Dva and Junk mains would hate this but it's time their characters require an amount of skill comparable to other characters.
No new map? I was so looking forward to Lima 😢😢😢
Anyone else notice so many of the clips were of the wrong version? Like when he’s showing off the beam width he’s on the old patch so hes showing the old one not new
RIP Phara
thanks goat
You really love shooting at Roadhog's belly button
Perfect vid. Thanks.
Mauga is so overpowered
question for the s9 mythbuster video: Does Doom regain more health when ulting with the new healing change for tanks?
PLEASE JUST BUFF PULSE BOMB IT DOES NOTHING NOW
It's weird to me that other tanks with armor health receive the health increase as armor except for Rein, who gets most of it as regular health.  I know he has a shield but tbh, that thing feels inconsequential when compared to the sustain abilities of other tanks.  Besides that, I absolute love this patch for DPS. I haven't played much DPS since OW2 started since Tank and Support have been so strong but Genji just feels so good to play again. And nearly every DPS feels like they have more impact in a fight.
I'm not sure I like these projectile changes. I guess gameplay impact is what matters the most. But look at that 9:53 Hanzo picture. He shoots arrows but the size is more like a freaking cannonball now. It is just weird to me that you can miss judging on what you see by that much and still land the shot.
Hogs self heal is basically useless now, with his increased health, increased enemy projectile size, it's past healing nerf and now 20% heal reduction
Anyone plzzz carry me im  healer main.
Hog is trash now…
Question for the mythe buster : Dose the heal passive charge your ult ?
Why is gengi op now?
Im open to changes and happy they are doing something big. But i am scared about how the projectile size changes will be
imagine doing such a big update and not even giving players the correct info that a nice youtuber* had to simplify it for us plebs.
More impact than overwatch 2 did to overwatch 1
I paid $200 for unlock the battle pass so I don’t have to play
Great video thank you for putting in the time to do this, really helps.
This is truly OW2
Forget about buffing ball why don’t we
Self heal out of combat , what is this Paladins ?
Anyone else feel like you get your mech back faster when in you’re in baby dva form ?? I swear I remech in like an instant now
Who asked for this? Why we talking all the skill requirements out of the game? I dont get it.
ah a Moira buff exactly what silver and gold need 😂
The junkertown kill widow😂😂
Hit boxes the size of barns
I cant believe it. Overwatch is stealing mechanics from paladins. It all comes full circle 😂
Every new patch i will keep saying this They keep buffing hero that counter ball but never once actually buff ball
I'm on PS5 and Pharah jet dash was bound to jump while  in mid air by default
Great job !
Thanks for the visually best looking, information compact all in one - VIDEO 💜
I have to learn History but first i need to watch this video
Reaper is now even more dead
Here i was thinking i just started being good at Hanzo out of nowhere
How is this game not dead
undocumented: 16 new bugs for doomfist
Stopped playing when OW2 came out, ngl. But I still love the way you go over the changes, I still like to keep up for whatever reason.
- Out of combat healing - Hits reduce the healing capability - Global projectile increase  I guess Paladins has never looked so good
Pharah will be cancer at low rank
Are there any reason to increase hp and at that time increase dmg on many heroes? It feels like if not the same time to kill but even more fragile with increased hitboxes. Oh, mb the main reason is to give bad and new players chance to play and buy skins...
Tanks still blow up in under a second lol
This game is becoming Brawl stars, terrifying
NGL I think when they specifically mention a projectile size change that means that the global isn't going to apply to it, it's saying "everything changes the same except for this"
Didn't they say reaper was gonna get reworked?
Tbh if they add health to everyone and also increased dmg of almost everything what's the point? It's like inflation they raise min wage but everything cost more so you pretty much earn same amount of money lol
I think that when you press "character info" where you get description of abilities they should also provide numbers like shot is dealing "yx" you can heal someone by "yx" you know what i mean like in lol or something
Damn, they really just dropped Overwatch 3 just like that?
What a bullshit update. They just played with random numbers for absolutely no reason. Who asked for this ?
RIP tracer bomb 👋
okay but why is the font so minute? I can't even read it without full screen.  you're crazy!! you analysed these patch notes like a freak.!!
Im a heal main, how tf im supposed to support a 725hp tank, two 250 dps and one 250 healer without a small heal increase.... I did my placement game, i'm master 3 and just can play a "support hero" only "healer hero" bc healing take so damn long :(
Blizzard should legit just shut down.
This whole changes are dumb.. thanx for creating such a good informative clip
Thanks KarQ for this condensed video. Hate so bad this new update.  Call it "Unskilled Update" or "Fun Sup Destroyer Update". Go to fucking Valorant or same shitty games if you want low TTK. I'm so pissed off.
Blizz: lets increase health AND damage output so that it doesn't really matter lol lmao rofl derp perfect logic
100 swing is gunna  be somethin
But the selling point of hanzo and junk rat’s 1 shot is gone 🤷🏻‍♂️ i reckon thats ass
Now all we need is horses lmfao
Does a Duplicated Echo also have a 10% ult charge increase? Or is it just for the duplicate ultimate itself?
Man hanzo is shooting some of the weekest logs I've seen considering his 1 shot is gone for 90% of characters
Why you showing projectile size by aiming in the center of the body?
damage inflation goes hard
Blizzards blanket buffs make it hard to tell what the actual impact of these changes will be. It's gonna take time to figure iut
Oh great a stronger Pharah. Who's asking for tht. Pharmercy fcking sucks
Let's be honest. Reinhardt needed the most love out of all the characters.
20:20 idk why that made me laugh but it did
They need to revert the genji blade nerf to 120 again, it can't even two shot heroes now anyway so the extra 10 damage should be fine
They basically copied Paladins - any Paladins player knows what I'm talking about with Cauterize, One tank etc etc
Non-direct nerf to widow
It’s so joever
Another day another reason for me not to play overwatch since reaper hasn't gotten a buff in years
This is definitely a patch
Projectile changes are very very very very baaaaa... dddd for the game. Like you can literally not aim for a person and still get a headshot and kill em.... I don't know if they even test these changes themselves or not? Like bruh even a gold player like me can say its bad for the game's health
Shield is now useless bc of the new healing passive js
Bro they turned this into Paladins
Moira is now Symmetra before rework with that primary.
Zen kick deals 60 dmg is kinda crazy tho
Pharah can’t even fly anymore, like what.
Zombra, Roadhog, Pharah, Reaper, Widow, Zarya, Winston, and Wrecking ball all need some sort of a rework, im betting reaper will be next
DPS feels awful now how do you even fight tracer at this point
Karq is the goat, always the go to channel for any changes. Straight to the point and showing all detail, legend ❤
The projectile changes......just got out a game with 90%+ Accuracy 74% Crit A. on widow..................................... right where do i sign up for the pro leagues
Ow just copied caut and self healing from paladins 💀
Does "a competitive year" mean a season?
how you gonna say HP increased between 15 and 20 percent when most characters went from 200 to 250, which is a 25% increase???
I'm down for a big shake up like this. Really hope it goes well!
karq i  believe puttin a song into an update video is needless
Finally, Blizzard listened to all of our complains and indirectly nerfed genji!
Wins only 10 points …. Eww
They honestly  should put kiri at 225 hp
As a Dva main, I am so happy for these changes
Another thing that i have not read anywhere the season seems to be shorter. This Season is going for 56 days before it was 63 days so basically a week shorter.
The Pharah re-work is absolute ass. Her entire identity was flight. Now she’s forced to play the ground game. There was no need for the stupid jet dash ability when you were already able to use concussive blast to do the exact same thing.
Junkrat is basically the worst hero in the game now 💀
Rage post incoming: Why the FUCK do a bunch of the A, B, and C tier tanks get compensatory damage buffs to their kits while Wrecking ball gets nothing? So now the lowest damage output hero in the game has an EVEN SLOWER time to kill? The fuck is this? You could give him literally .5 damage and most of the ball players would rejoice. This is such bizarre balancing.
THE GENJI BUFF PROPHECY IS TRUE
This sounds like a buff for Hanzo. But let’s not forget everyone got a health buff. Hanzo can now only 1 shot 4 hero’s with a headshot. ( tracer, widow, LW, Zen)
The fact rein deals 100 dmg per swing now is insane.
Good News #1:  You won't ranfomly die to a Hanzo arrow Bad News #1: You'll randomly be left almost dead by Hanzo ALOT more. Good News #2: Flanker mains (Tracer, Sombra, etc) can now operate even more freely without bothering their supports Bad News #2: FUCKIN NOTHING WILL DIE WITH ALL THAT HEALTH. THERE ARE NO SQUISHIES IN OW ANYMORE. Actually with the projectile buffs, Ana/Kiri will probably kill you before you kill them
im actually mad about the jade weapons thing. i have 2600 "legacy" comp credits now and cannot get any more for an entire year. i dont want a fucking ugly green ass gun on my cleric lifeweaver and nnow i hvae to wait an entire year to just transfer my other comp credits into golden gun comp credits?? why?????// why cant we just buy either???? i get introducing new credits so that you cant just get a jade gun right away but restricitng people from buying golden guns who dont have enough is so dumb. how does a jade gun incentivize me to play comp its just not cute i would much rather have a golden gun
wtf is this pharah !!!!!
Thank god Orisa got more armor. She was too easy to kill. Way hard to play. 🙃
Zar land mei can legit shoot to the side of someone and still have it register as them taking damage. No skill season. It also helps console and bad aim players alot now for all characters.
So phara is the revenant from doom eternal
thank you so so much for this video. so informative and also bit entertaining way of doing the patch notes and getting some one up to the speed of the season for all over watch players o7
so basically every hero does more damage but it doesnt matter because they all have more health
can we all just take a second to appreciate how much work and time was put in this video for us. you work doesnt go unappreciated xx
Phara Rework is like a nerf to her
Just realized they took my two shot combo
Ah yes let’s show the projectile increases by shooting the largest character in the game dead center in the torso, amazing showcase of the larger projectiles!
They indirectly nerfed tracer. Previously tracer and  all characters who were 200 hp and she at 150 the hp gap was 50 hp, now with 175hp and 250 the gap became 75 hp. Not to mention, that you have to stay in the fight for longer and yet you only have same 3 blinks, the anti heal passive is useless if the target you are shooting is being pocketed and not to mention, while everyone is spamming bigger hitboxes, it made tracer dying even more than before.  And in general, this patch solved nothing just made the game worse.
Ult cost increase by 10%
Stopped playing last year but I support you so I watch.
hanzo buff is a joke.
Pharah sounds like a balanced threat. It’s easier to get in and out with her now, BUT she’s arguably more vulnerable than before because she’s forced to the ground more often
As a lucio player I can say that YEAHHHHHHHH LETTTSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
im convinced someone at blizzard hates rammatra
I feel like Blizzard is just telling us that everyone sucks at the game.   - Tanks don't defend their team enough. Better give everyone more HP. - Supports don't keep their team alive enough.  Better give everyone self-heal. - DPS don't do enough damage. Better make it so it's impossible to miss.  Like, what was even the point?
Honestly, make bastion a tank, give him 400 health(only adding towards armor), nerf his damage all around, and give him like a 500 to 250 shield ability that lasts 6 seconds and covers his front(back if in turret form, full dome in ult) might be an absolute garbage nonsense take but if they’re going to give him 350 health as a dps I’d much rather see him be a tank at that point
As a Rein main. This has killed him for me. Mans useless now lmao
so with the new dps passive, is Moira gunna get any buffs? I can imagine having your only "utility" being nerfed by 20% would be a staggering blow to your viability. but I guess with the new sizes, she'll do more damage and have more to heal with teammates taking damage so faster/more ults?
DRAGON BLADE DOES LESS DAMAGE THAN A KIRIKO HEADSHOT
interesting new season of overwatch. generally, i'd say more good than bad this time.
For people who care about the grouping restrictions being removed (which was discussed at blizzcon), supposedly that change is coming later. Presumably they're trying to limit the amount of pure chaos they add to ranked all in one go.
Devs forgor health packs exist.
These hitbox changes are dog. You don't even have to hit the actual body anymore. You guys complaining about the healing after 5 seconds don't understand how much more impactful and over forgiving these projectile changes are
Bro just take widow out the game atp smh
10 competitive points per win is absurd man… you’ll have to win 300 games to get one jade gun wtf
Seems to me like they basically just fucked tanks.
that moment when zen kicks harder than he shoots his orbs
Firestrike should two shot
Why did they increase the log size. That was the one projectile that didn't need a size increase.
Can’t believe hanzo can’t even one shot most characters now, he needs a buff bro.
The passive change for support is a nerve because it used to be after 2 seconds of not taking damage for them
Game turning into paladins slowly
I think this changes is not needed why add 75 hp and weapon bullet size?
Does Torb’s hammer still only do 55 or did it scale up too?
This new recover health out of battle kinda nerf the champions with shield health because that was the point of those heroes able to recover some of  their health overtime vs other heroes
Respectfully, including the hitbox increase and ultimate cost changes in every single individual hero section makes this incredibly tedious to watch.
I think you mixed up Zaria and Sigma in terms of HP / Shield
OK no no no hog does not deserve  any health buff this is the worst patch bullshyt ever.
All the health changes are due to match inflation
You've transformed a skeptic into a believer!
So if multiple dps shoot the same person do the healing debuffs stack?
To all of the people complaining about hanzo, he can’t even one-shot a support anymore. He’s the worst dps in the game(besides genji).
this is comfortably the stupidest patch they couldve rolled out
doom is back?? 😂😂😂
Dude this Moira skin is easily hands-down my favorite skin ever in any video game including this one to be created. I KNOW WHAT I SAID AND ILL SAY IT AGAIN.
Hmmm not a fan so far, it feels like nothing dies now. Maybe need to get used to it.
Nee comp point system is total ass 25 points a win was completely fine
You know you could have just said every ultimate cost is increased by 10% and not say it literally every time.
karq why are you such a sellout after just the intro i dont wanna watch no more , biggest patch ?wdf u talking about this season is pure trash lacking all kind of content we got a shitty 5min mission , we got back old rank system but a bit trashier and we got nothing new but +50hp on chars
atleast i wont have to deal with support that dont heal me the entire game
There's a bear with you?
Bro thank you so much for those information 🌹❤
A fully charged empowered punch into a wall does 172.5 damage. Add a nano boost and this shoots up to 230 AOE damage burst…       >:)
You forgot to mention that hanzo can no longer one shot unless its Widow or Tracer.
Just me being nitpicky, but the majority of heroes went from 200 to 250 which is a 25% hp increase.  On your general hero changes card you put 15-20% hp buff, lol.  Thanks for the content, KarQ!
The nerf of 25 to 10 comp points per win and no big payout depending on where you end really stinks
Worst season so far.
im so back on doom
The global projectile size has to be the stupidest thing ever. I love running in there as Lucio/Genji and just being annoying, now everytime i try doing that, the enemies completely miss me and still deal dmg to me. Great upd8 man 😂
Hanzo actually received a huge nerf. No more head 1 shots. I'm a Hanzo main but don't see a reason to play him after that
Rip Widowmaker
Yea bro we playing genji again
Bro they'll do anything but add in a 2nd tank lmao.
why is overwatch turning into paladins 💀
mercy is a stupid hero
I was happy with the reinhardt buff but everyone has more health so it doesn't really matter he is still the same
kind of feel like this might make skill gaps nonexistent
all it took to kill all hope for this update was hearing that they made Moira even easier.
I already hate these projectile size changes. Headshots are spoonfed to the player now…
sooooooooooooooooooo they just made the game playable with bumpers cause i never seen an issue with hitting anyone 😭. now i just wont have a issue at all XD
Me when they forgot to add damage to reins fire strike, which in theory makes his firestrikes kinda bad now 😭
RIP hanzo  Blizzard remove all the fun of playing him, no one shot = shit tbh
1) Man, no Reaper or Wrecking Ball rework yet but nooo, we're giving PHARAH one first? Are we at least getting them soon or are we going to have to wait until the next 10 million seasons for the sake of marketing hype? And before anyone says that Blizzard has already done enough in this update, of course I recognize that but if they went out of their way to squeeze in a Pharah rework, then I would think and hope that in about a week or 2 each, they can deliver the reworks for Reaper, Wrecking Ball, and any other hero who needs it  2) Also because we all know that Sombra is the worst and everyone who argues otherwise is automatically wrong and/or bias, here's an idea for the perma-invisible nightmare of player gameplay to not be one that heals while invisible: Make it so she can only self-heal while uncloaked. From there, make her invisibility manual so she can either choose to stay uncloaked for healing or to cloak despite not healing
FINALLY MY EFFORT OF SPAMMING THEM TO BUFF TRACER'S HP HAS FINALLY PAID OFF!
Very quick and Informative thank you
I genuinely wamt to know what the fuck were the devs smoking when coming up with this changes
THE LUCIO BUFF IS REAL
1 more thing, junk can no longer 1 shot with his mine combo
Wait so does this mean the hover jets and jump can’t be the same as Pharah anymore with this dash added?
Phara not regening fuel mid air feels pretty awful
Overwatch 1.6: Hit Enemies even when you Missed
I dont get it, they are buffing all heroes health but they are also buffing their dmg so what’s the point if it’s gonna be the same?
Anti-tank season tbh
Is baps lamp projectile size increased? Could see that being a pain throwing around corners etc
I like the idea of longer fights. The projectile size was already favorable and hopefully doesn't break the game.
Bliz is freaking make My LW go worse and worse again…
I feel like this was more of a nerf to main tanks like my boy rein and Winston. It was noticeably harder to kill things with them today. Every game felt like it was decided by my dps or their dps. So mercy is meta again now
phew, hanzo arrows got bigger. I was getting tired of hanzo arrows missing me sometimes.
wtf does being favoured in battle mean
I've played a bit of the new hanzo and he's absolutely viable but nowhere near as fun anymore, he's my main and I'd rather his projectile be the size of a pin if it meant he could keep his one shot. They've taken away his special sauce
Why on earth do they give orisa 75 armor but only 50 to rein? And same with dva like rein is a dude in armor who hits you with a hammer HE NEEDS MORE ARMOR THAN THE OTHER TANKS THEY HAVE RANGE 😂😭
The best explanation of this update. Huge thanks
I just tried it. I'm an Ana main and I can no longer 3 tap a phara anymore, which if I could pull off, felt amazing. I hate these changes. I've been playing this game almost exclusively since 2017. I just uninstalled it. I was so close to uninstalling when Mauga got introduced but I reluctantly dealt with it. This update was the straw that finally broke the camels back. This used to be a fun game and most of the time I was happy. Now when I win it doesn't even feel good. All my matches end with me feeling frustrated regardless if I win. It feels like I just got released from a prison sentence. Good riddance.
I already don’t like that hanzo
Wow what a surprise ball still didn’t get a buff (health doesn’t count cuz everyone else got health buffs)
What about hitscan ults like roadhogs?
best patch summaries, thank you~
Played about two hours and I sadly hated how it felt. I play a lot of movement based characters like genji and Lucio and worked really hard to get really good at movement and making it really hard for enemies to shoot me yet all that time has when down the drain now that it’s so easy to hit someone if you’re just looking in their general direction. When I play characters like bap it feels like I’m not doing anything skill wise and that the game is playing more than me
It’s like they made this whole patch just to fuck over hog more
Lets not let them cook
Tank feels awful just played 3 matches. Ram, queen, hog and  malga felt so bad. You can't kill anything, you get less healing and nobody misses. What were they thinking 😂
Prices are going up too??
Take a shot everytime KarQ says 10%
wrecking ball damage is so shit its even harder to get a kill now
finally got the boop buff
Welcome to overwatch 3
So, being a pro now will just depend on your game sense and luck cuz apparently aim doesn't matter anymore Also what you wanna pick is now more influenced by how much and fast the hero can output damage cuz there is less chance to miss, and this will sustain the damage passive too I'm kinda pessimistic about these changes but let's wait and see
ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE A NEW VID, THANKS KARQ❤🔥👍
Even Overwatch HP is experiencing inflation
Unfortunately Doomfist got a handful of bugs. Audio bugs but a lot of his techs were removed. It’s really unfortunate.
Thanks for all this
Yea im pretty sure dva ult has always done 1k, its even been on the wiki forever
I think this kills the game. Extra health doesnt fix anything all the issues come from supports being too overpowered and nothing ever dying. Now things die even less which makes it even worse. Mercys now a must pick cuz shes unkillable as a pocket unless you dedicate your entire team which helps getting rezs too and now damage boost helps melt healthpools better than ever, not to mention she rarely needs to heal her pocket with the new healing passive
I played Overwatch Alpha, and got to top 500 on season 1. Continued to play until season 7, then I gave up on the game. Racked up over 7 gold weapons and many cosmetics. Then I stopped playing, and to this stay I still haven’t played the game. Those changes might finally make me start playing the game again and stick to it, we’ll see.
BOOP BUFF 🗣🗣🗣🗣💯💯‼️‼️ LUCIO MAFIA ON TOP 😤😤😤🔥🔥🔥
Torb hammer OP
myth busting question: does suzu cleanse the DPS passive of 20% less healing?
So they have a self healing like the planet and zombies do in PvZ GW/GW2
ok so they fucked with my main goddamn
Phara is no longer playable on console, yay :(
New KarQ vid! Time to decide if I’m playing the game again!
Just giving everyone heals is a great way to make sure healers are useless. Bad change.
What’s the goal of all of these changes?   What are all these changes meant to achieve?
The healing reduction thing for DPS is great. So imagine this: you shoot Bastions armor, you stick the bastion with the pulse bomb, you shoot at him again, and he doesn't die. Or, you nano-blade, and it gets OUT HEALED by a damn moira ult.
Im so mad they changed the passive jets on phara, The whole point of playing Phara was that good players were able to stay in the air…
Bro torb has a shotgun ?? Since when ??
I feel agony for playing supports now. that new passive from dps kills me inside
THEY BUFFED BOOP!!!!!! Frogger really has an influence lol.
Didn’t expect Trails ost in this video 😂
How many of the damage buffs are actually buff from last patch and not increases to the damage number to bring it in line with the global health increase? The way I see it, after this patch, if an ability didn't get touched, let's say Orisa's Javelin throw, it technically got nerfed due to everyone's health being higher than last season.
As a Cass player I'm a little annoyed that Magnetic grenade still only does 75 damage after this patch. If they took away Hinder and bumped the damage back up to at least 100 I'd be happy.
paladins 2. now we just need auto aim abilities that hit no matter what
18:35 In the patch notes it says +0.15m for travel time projectiles less than or equal to 50m/s. Lucio’s primary fire is 50m/s. So why does he only get +0.10m?
Love that with every patch we keep getting closer to be Paladins
the game just keep getting worse An appretiation comment for Jeff Kaplan💔💔
Why tf did they buff horse
They copy pasted Paladins passives essentially.
Quiting Overwatch. The competitiveness is gone. GM aiming and Bronze aiming has little differences now.
This  IS THE DOOM BUFF IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
they sorta nerfed supports a little? i guess?
RIP Lifeweaver 😩
this gonna be a wild season csn feel it in my uterus 🙏🏽
21:09 someone help, i‘ve been looking at this part of the junkertown rework for 10 mins and i can‘t find a difference
Repairing torb turret should count as mitigation
Doom players are probably so happy to get anything lol
Does anybody know if the 20% healing reduction also count for Reapers Selfheal?  And is there an approximate release time for the rework of ball and reaper out yet?
everyone is just a tank now
Finally junkrat nerfs ❤
Tank remains the shittiest feeling role in the game lets gooo
blizzard always ruining fun shi smh. No longer infinite fly for pharah? id rather them make mercy damage boost worthless with her
Все, пора удалять игру...
Woah, they're almost getting close to it actually being a sequel game!
Sym can’t miss
Another patch with no meaningful changes for Rein. When will the suffering end
Bro the DPS healing reduction is going to be so annoying Also love how the health buffs are so much more then damage increases, athough i guess shots will be easier to hit
Healing reduction sounds dumb an why
i genuinely dont understand the point of this patch. i thought they wanted to raise the TTK but not only do they raise the hitboxes on everything, but they raise the damage? doesnt that defeat the point?
oh it's up already.
That point reset from the currency we use for the golden weapons cost me 5200 competitive points. May they rest in peace
i love the production quality of these videos
Yeah those new projectile sizes are definitely a problem that should be tuned down. You don’t need to be near the character when shooting
I would like to say thank you for going over each hero and how each projectile size affects each hero
wtf are they doing
hanzo shoots whole trees again, its just like 2017
UHM HOW DID U GET THAT WALLPAPER!!!? I WANT IT!!! For my computer!! It’s😍 plzzz
LUCIO BOOP BUFF
My junkrat…. 😢 They massacred my boy
This update completely gutted genji
What is the point of shield health now?
THEY BUFFED KIRIKO???? LMAO SHE'S ALREADY OP COME ONNNNNNN
Supports are STARVING this update R.I.P
10:42 reduced or increased? text is confusing :D
Already hating to go agaisnt Genji
This update might make me get back into playing overwatch 2
oh no huntsman
This update is a little confusing to me. Give every hero more health making them harder to kill. Increasing projectile size globally, and damage for many heroes, making things easier to kill again? It just sounds kind of redundant, I'm sure the proportions of the increases makes sense on the backend and maybe in play, but sounds a little goofy on paper
Guys, I think that the ultimate cost is increased by 10%, I don't know for sure though.
so you cant oneshot shit now with hanzo???
gotta increase Burst healing to account for higher health pools now
It’s official, junkrat is now the worst hero in the game
Maybe I'm old but doesn't monkey damage increase to his Tesla mean the melee tech is out of date now. Used to melee/Tesla swap for 1v1s to save ammo since it did the same damage would it be dumb to melee now?
This whole patch/rework is a bog nerf for Genji xD
Great video.
As a Rein main, most of this patch just looks like pure unadulterated pain to me
Lowkey what’s the point of blue health now😭
The power scalling is getting tio powerful....
So basically hanzo cannot one shot anymore
Give genj armor cuz he’s a cyborg
This update is EXACTLY what I've been asking for, I could not be more happy, I'm shocked and extatic at these changes, I think the teams really showed there true colors with this update, not being controlled by the goblin man who previously ran the thing. Healers are less impactful, No more instakills, No more ult spam, Individual skill is more important, Flying characters and characters with small hitboxes are now actually killable in the lower ranks, you wont be seeing nothing but kiri, mercy, hanzo and pharah in metal ranks now. As a doomfist main, I spam melee alot while waiting for my fist gun to recharge so the bonus damage is MASSIVE. I also kept saying that doomfist just needed a tiny bit more health to be fun to play, AND HE GOT IT! I'm gonna be all over this game this season.
Bastion is OP now lol
This game is trash tier now for some of the dps. Gl playing any flanker, hog, or mauga
This is going to be such a shit patch
I really hope they buff junkrat because this just removed his 1 shot combo
Dude kiri Kunais are going to feel awful to go up against
The projectile size change benefits console players very much
Mythbusters: 1. Is NANOBLADE dead? 2. Is Genji 1 shot combo back (dash+shurikens hs+melee)?
Hitbox size increase should not be for ppl like hanzo... that's ridiculous
They nerfed how much competitive points we get after each match and got rid of the bonus we got depending what rank we were in at the end of a season...if you do the math it's a pretty big nerf
17:15 Grammer- Projectile is spelt as "Projetile"
so basically, cheaters dont need to cheat just aim now
Idk i got banned
DOOMFIST!!!! BWAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
man you are amazing
Don’t forget to remind everyone that every hero’s ultimate charge has increased by 10% karq !
Soldier: 76's Heavy Pulse Rifle is explicitly used as an example for precision hitscan weapons getting a +0.08 size increase, and travel time projectile weapons with a speed of 50 m/s or less are getting the +0.15 size increase, which includes Helix Rockets. Soldier's buffs are bigger than what KarQ is stating here.
why did blizzard need to pull a blizzard move and make 2 diff comp credits smh
Personly I think genjis going to suck next season like even worse then he did this season
Worst patch ever, didnt nerf genji
For zarya, If you count the number of bars for her health, her barrier health got increased by 3 bars instead of her white health. So I think we might had a little mistake there. 6:53
Love all the damage adjustments with everyone’s health pools except for genji. So fucking cool
Every update overwatch *gameplay* is getting closer to paladins *gameplay*  5v5, healing reduction, slower ttk, bigger hitboxes, slower ults, self-healing for everyone, tanks are stronger overall, etc. (all I could remember)  i bet they're gonna make the movement slower and even easier to hit shots so that aiming is still important but not feel random because of the acceleration of the game
Pretty sure they said Cass and soldier both fall under the same hitscan category (precise) and get +0.8, is that not the case anymore?
Watching this video in a vc with friends who are really loud. I appreciate the on screen before and afters, as well as the change itself on screen. it makes it very easy to follow along without audio, so thank you for that!
idk if this is new but reins headshot shatter is up from 170 to 200 so he can still swing slam squishies  edit: for those who dont know cass and zen would have to be swung on twice with a headshot shatter because 170+100 isnt 275 but since they made shatter 200 now you can still swing once and headshot shatter them
Placements again :(
Wow a lot of these "changes" are projectile sizes and HP. They made everyone thiCCCer in HP but really left Torb's turret in the awful state it's in? Now its REALLY gonna be worthless with all these changes man. Not even a small health boost for survival for it.. just nothing. "Oh but the DPS passive" doesn't matter much when everyone deletes his turret as SOON as they see it. And it's never worth trying to save it cause you cannot hammer it faster than the damage it's taking plus you'll end up shoot too.
This is all because they wanted 5v5 instead of 6v6 smh
biggest patch = all heroes+ 50 hp and projectile size + 0.05?) Why ever bother
I won't ever share shit dog ima keep it 100 on a stack
how does the DPs passive work does it stack with another DPS? totaling over 40% healing reduction for 2 seconds or its 20% healing reduction for 4 seconds
Nerfs to Lifeweaver is insane.   Guess Blizzard is against Pansexuals.
12:30 I don't see it it in game.
What’s the point of the extra health, I feel like this is a bad change ngl, just lowers the skill floor
Giving heroes who already have a lotta health like reaper and mei MORE HEALTH seems incredibly stupid
Man i cant wait for rein to be viable again…..
How TF is out here rocket jumping with Pharah bruh... Let's be fuckin FR right now... Show yourselves ☠️🤣
game is beyond broken now. ffs, blizzard, if you cant balance the game, why do even try making such a massive changes that apply basically on everything. Just think about it - you've had a pool of heroes that could've one shotted you. And after this patch, some of them still can do it - hanzo, widow, rein. And some... Can't - junk, ashe. Just... Why? What were blizzard thinking about? How to make people play less of their game?
I already have all the skins I could want. I could've used those Comp points for the gold on characters I don't play :(
Gameplay wise cautiously optimistic, patch looks fun. Although all these changes remind me of how much Overwatch has changed over the years  I'd honestly love if they threw in a gameplay stats wise equivalent nostalgia mode event for just around/or before when Sombra was added. They could tuck it in the custom games presets as a little love letter gift to old early Overwatch 1 veterans that'd be cool
So the main issue with playing ball was doing not enough burst damage to be able to secure kills and not being able to do anything to protect the team.  The main issue with playing against ball was that he is incredibly hard to kill.   This patch makes both issues worse. Woohoo.
This is so many changes I’m surprised they didn’t call it Overwatch 3
Ngl this looks so goofy Bro I love it
This is a lot :( . I dont think i can do this.
Power creep at it's finest
Doom is not up rn, he's bugged again, just watch quakes stream
No new map? Don't they usually add a new map when they don't add any hero? PVE MISSIONS? WHERE BRUHH
Welcome to Paladins, Hero of the Realm
can widowmaker one shot now?
The damage passive feels soo odd
The new watertower on junkertown looks like one of Reinhardts beer cups 😂
I get what your saying but you should streamline the words your using and make it more consistent to make it less confusing for people who might have room temp iq  Nahh whole video was a mess vsing did characters and the vidoes meant nothings? Why show using the ultimate to show the cost???? Like what?  Low effort content from karq
I really hope the dps passive has a big impact on the game
This video was so helpful omg
Overwatch is becoming paladins with the self healing, I wonder how this will shake up the meta
So, tank players what hero are you playing this season? apex or valorant?
Mister Q of Kar, how excited were you to unleash the video for this mega-patch? 😁
Why does he keep saying should be? He’s literally reading the patch notes for fact
Ain’t no way the most overpowered and most annoying tank got 100 health bonus fucking nerf Mauga he’s not fun to play against
hahahaha  cant wait till hp is in the tens of millions and the dps is in the millions...  like it happened in wow before numbers crunch...  also... widow will need to 2-3 headshot someone... wow... what a "sniper"  did they just destroyed Pharah hover? wow...
Oh god the mercy buff
@OGPure would be proud of this buff 14:24
Overwatch 3 looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Does the projectile size buff apply ultimates? Pulse bomb feels bigger
Does pulse bomb get bigger since its a projectile
was there an example to see how the damage 20% reduced healing looked like in comparison
"And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%." "And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%." "And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%." "And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%." "And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%." "And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%." "And the ultimate cost will be increased by 10%."  Okay.  We got the idea.
So….overwatch 3
One thing that sucks about doom is how reliant he is on emp punch, main way to secure kills I wish they would do some power shift more into his slam and or primary
Does anyone know where the hero mastery tower defense mode is hiding? Because it’s not in hero mastery or arcade or anywhere in the Overwatch game
This is one of the worst patches in OW history, the hitbox changes are terrible
Still missing old Doomfist 🥲
Does deflected damage still carry the dps passive?
The projectile sizes increase is so fucking stupid
So it's basically paladins now?
Mauga is gonna be stupid to play against  Meta again
as if being perma invis wasnt annoying enough sombra can now heal while being invis nice
I just feel like everyone's geting tankier and I kinda hate that... I just got the feeling that, at higher ranks, people know how to aim decently and this bigger projectiles are not gonna be a big change. But now everyone is more tanky, i'm affraid to loose the fact that you could die rather quiclky...
PharMercy is going to be so much harder to deal with now
all doomfist mains rejoice no more are the days of dying from getting plucked off after no evasion heals!!!
fuck this imma go play some paladins
I don't love these Pharah changes. It's not enough and a lot of the buffs are just replacing what you lost. Imo Pharah players want to do AOE damage from the air with splashing rockets, let us do that.
The devs ruining the game on purpose with these projectile changes
this why i quiz ow2 after the first season, ive been playing since the release les in 2016-2017 and this game is going to the shitter sadly
Hog is even worse than he was before rework 😂  Good job on making him viable blizzard
The dps passive implies that roadhog/reaper are nerfed since it nerfs their regen ...
the worst season
They really do be sprinkling some paladins into overwatch.  Higher HP Passve anti heal on weapon shots Passive healing out of combat  Really makes you think which is a "better" game and which one copied from the other  (I play both so just find it funny)
That Pharah change kills the whole "tech" behind learning how to manage your resources as Pharah. Like, I know complaining about patch changes is useless, but... What's the point of a flying hero that can't fly? I bet Echo can retain more airtime than Pharah now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They're gutting support. so.... this sucks.
Could you imagine if GOATS was still around with these changes. Matches would never end
So hanzo can't one shot kill the majority anymore? Since almost everyone now is at least 250 health? Big nerf for him basically?
Need more Mei buffs on dmg
I love how ur just shooting roadhogs belly button at 7:07 with Ashe 😂😂
Please apply self-damage to junk's primary. It's important.
I can shit on OW2 (and I will because... It's overwatch 2), but i am happy to see they're finally trying to fix pharah. Shes the worst character for the health of the game forcing hitscan heroes to be able to counter her and pharmercy just being absurd to deal with in low-mid ranks.
The Mercy changes don't seem to be working, anyone else? (For the Guardian Angel change)
You're still the best doing this KarQ
Massive patch indeed
At least they made reaper more tanky and agressieve wich is good since hé got bad nerf
So basically what paladins do
that damage passive is actually really good, defo felt in comp
ffs, Tracer and Widow only getting 25hp, but everyone else getting 50+
i like being able to stack in gm and passive healing for everyone but that’s it
Small detail but in the video it looks like zarya's health increase was to shield, not health like the patch note says
I know its already uploaded but i think a better to do this patch is to do the soecifics of the global changes separately to the individual changes
not one minute into the video and i already see ball being worse with no buff 😃
With the health increases I really think small hps healing should be buffed a little. Lucio, brig, illaris pylon, and zens heal orb. Also just bought the battle pass but it didn't give me any of the tiers? I'm still gonna have to grind the BP. Did they change this? Or is it a bug?
Thanks for the hard work,  bud .. easy to understand . Appreciate your time ⏲️
Hard buffing hp is not a good change. Overall it seems like hitscans will be meta like they always are and while projectile dps will have a harder time. Don’t like the changes to health.
Widow needs a buff
Cringe update for Paladins players😭😭😭
I don't think this is going to bring me back imo. From partially playing OW1 to being excited and hopeful after Season 1 OW2. And now just completely dropping the game after playing less and less I just don't think the game is really redeemable.
Genji still ass, yikes
L changes
So just making support more broken dope.
You seriously felt the need to say the ult charge change for each and every single hero when it applies to everyone? Ffs
Hanzo is useless, cant one shot shit anymore
rip hanzo's oneshot, makes him unplayable for me, now I have to learn widow
widow meta moment
this should be on the main page of OW
Shield health means absolutely nothing when regular health and now even armor regen over time. The only unique thing about shield was it came back over time after they got rid of Sombra messing with it.  Shield health means nothing anymore.
Junk dmg needs to be raise back to 130 for a chance to be viable
Let's Goooooo Fam as a doomfist main I am glad but that ultimate nerf dang
Junkrat is dead. So sad. Need to reinstate 250 dmg for 1 shot combo or just rework him.
This is looking more and more like Paladins
i think with the outer layer damage change, it used to be 900 max if you were just outside the inner layer range. now it scales down from 1000 instead of 900 in the outer layer to have consistent numbers
They still found the way to buff kiri smh
The patch notes say that the global projectile size increase only applies to damage dealing projectiles, so does Bap's Biotic Launcher grenade really get the projectile size? Jw
Love to see it becoming paladins 2
Rip junk
Dva dang
You are the goat Bro for making this video
18:45 it seems you used the same video twice to show the increased knockback. The video and therefore the distance is identical!
Praying that they drop this in mid season patch
These changes are interesting.  Is Blizzard just trying to penalize players who are good with their aim or what?
So no wide grouping like they said at Blizzcon?
honestly they should've just given everyone shields to make it easier to understand
Guessi wnt be playing genji no more
could you do another video like you’ve done before, where it’s about best settings and crosshair setting for overwatch 2 season 9
Holy shit, Pharah got BUFFED
per hero ulti cost +10% should have been cut from video , keep the video shorter
Wtf did they do to this game?
Overwatch 2’s toxicity handling system is absolute utter garbage.
Slow wifi plays like my comment. Because we gotta wait for this Damn update.
I feel like this video could've been cleaned up a little bit, by quickly glossing over the hitbox increases and the ult cost increases at the same time after all other changes (per hero), so that instead of showcasing them as full on changes every time, they would essentially be reminders.
Putting Genji in green in the thumbnail should be a federal offense.

Who asked for D.va's ult cost increase? Isnt enough her 4sec delay to just get inside the mech?
"Oh my god the change are so good, Season 9 OW2 will be a complete new game"   Season 9 launched: Still the same Souj, Tracer and 76 Meta.
Basically no time stamps? Please add more
Because of all these new reticle options that have been added this season and the option between forms do you think you could make an updated reticle video? :D
i speak for everyone when i say Orisa just needs just be deleted in this patch.
Karq when you kill somebody does the tag in the kill feed represent the same time as the time that you have to wait to respawn
And this video turned up perfectly on time. thanks KarQ!
You forgot the timestamps!!
No pve ... Ow1 was a pro game ow0.2 si more casual moove slower colisions a bit fu... With that patch skill to shoot disapear. On ow2 gold plat can be gm now bronze too
My time to play Hanzo has come!
R.i.p ow
Time stamps are messed up lol
Doom needed his primary fire buffed instead.
Blizzard: "Hey, let's add more health to every hero ! "  Community: "For what"   Blizzard: "Too increased the size of the projectile !"   Community: "But our aim will decrea-"   Blizzard: "MORE INCREASE MORE"
Damn bro I had no idea they made that many changes to DVA.
You know the health increase and the projectile size... kibd if screams mobile... like they want to try and make ow mobile and these are the startong points.
Great doomfist is still trash but no lets make support even stronger
The amount of effort you put into these videos is amazing. Very well-made and informative.
Now all they need to change is the name of the game and they are done 😅 Srly is this still Overwatch at all?
I wish they'd undo balls ow1 range nerf...
Does the damage passive count for roadhog breather? Maybe that and his defense is why he is at 800 hp
So genji got a nerf from the changes
almost the whole video is about DVA changes hmmm
I've played this patch for 2 hours https://twitch.tv/karq and it's actually way better than expected. You get ZEN SKIN drops for watching 12 hours on twitch come!!
Yuh I’m not first but one here yuh🤟🏽
Overwatch 3 Hype Button!
Idk abt every character being able to heal themselves but im willing to see what its like before hating
i wonder if they're gonna do any buffs in this one
I WATCHED YOU MAKE THE THUMBNAIL!
Yellow
second?
Got it
Great thumbnail karkew
Am i actually the first one?
First abhahahaha
THEY MASACRED GENJI WHYYYYYYY
First
First
