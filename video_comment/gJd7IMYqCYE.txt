It's really shame that you can't see anything like this in the game.
You totally plow snow and collect wood in this game
Click Aitkin wouldn't it be awesome if the game actually played like this this game is really about being a social platform that cost money drops the mic walks away

Pay to play
best game ever
Can't lie I downloaded this game recently and honestly I am addicted to this game
I just SMILE
Money grabbing 😂
واو😂
Huge P2P game. The worst state I’ve been to recently is #1222. Got a tyrant president & alliance. The entire server is just that top alliance & their “family” that breaks off into 4 other alliances. You can’t even play in that state without being threatened. The presidents remark is if you can’t cough up money & time every day, you don’t deserve to play online games. Even their own members flaunt their credit cards making remarks that you’re an adult if you have money LMFAO huge predators in that state too. The top alliance seeks out people below 17 & has an 18+ chat where you can share photos, & their own kids.
わお
かっこよ
What nice video for a character you can only get with money.
This particular hero if you don't spend 1k usd don't even think of getting it😂
Game is the biggest p2w shit ever. Can’t recommend. I still regret starting it a year ago. The system is designed to grab as much money as possible. As f2p you are a little worm. People will tell you to not join their rallies and you are also not strong enough to start a rally yourself, you also can’t defend. Spenders can skip everything instantly even troop march speed. They just fly into you with VIP12 meteors and there is nothing you can do. Probably the worst game in the whole AppStore
Poiytewq
So glad to come see that I'm not the only one traumatized by this game LMBO I'm just here for my 100 gems
Dang that show has gone far
The first 10-15 levels have story and similar to ads.. Fun game
Stop Being greedy with money whiteout company
I haven't spent a penny, takes longer to get strong but I still enjoy the game.  I just know I won't get that hero.
Free to play. Ironically, Jeronimo is one of two heroes that isn’t free 😂
✌️
Can you upgrade the graphics something similar to clash of kings
FREE TO PLAY 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A game that is very much about money, and if it stays like this, many will retire. It is beautiful, so do not spoil it.

تعال وشاهد: الدفع المتوسط vsالدفع العالي🤡🪦
CECC Chair: “An Atrocity Unmatched in Its Wickedness” Chris Smith, U.S. Representative and Chair of CECC, started the hearing by highlighting its significance, “It is an important hearing, one which addresses one of the most persistent, horrific human rights abuses of our time, but sadly, one which has not received the widespread attention and condemnation it deserves.” He’s previously held two hearings in the U.S. Congress and said organ harvesting is unimaginable and unacceptable.    U.S. Representative and CECC Chair Chris Smith hosted the hearing on March 20, 2024.  Citing previous findings in 2019 from the China Tribunal by Sir Geoffry Nice, Smith said the tribunal concluded “unanimously and sure beyond a reasonable doubt—that in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time, involving a substantial amount of victims.” More specifically, the main victims were Falun Gong practitioners and Uyghurs.   “Forced organ harvesting on an industrial scale in China is an atrocity unmatched in its wickedness,” Smith explained, adding, “The numbers of those executed for their organs—some even before they are brain dead—is staggering.” That is why the China Tribunal considered the state sanctioned forced organ harvesting in China “Crimes Against Humanity.”   About a year ago, the House of Representatives passed the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act by an overwhelming 413-2 vote, and Smith called for the “Senate to bring the bill across the finish line. That landmark and bipartisan legislation authorizes the Secretary of State to deny passports and visas to any individuals involved in illegal organ trafficking—in China and globally.” Furthermore, the bill mandates annual reporting by the State Department on forced organ harvesting globally, and authorizes sanctions for individuals and entities that facilitate organ harvesting.   “Silence is unacceptable—particularly from medical associations and corporations. If they remain silent, they are the most at risk of complicity in a crime against humanity,” concluded Smith, adding, “If we don’t act now, many more lives will be lost.”
Right around the time your heros are lvl 30 you'll start feeling the squeeze on leveling up your heros and the blue gems. At this point in my age and gaming experience I  recognize this as the game design tacitly pushing you towards purchases after getting you hooked on the idea. After they've stimulated you with sounds and lights and what not. So yeah....whiteout survival everyone. Alright I'm gonna go get my hundred gems.
Be careful guys. It’s a big money grab and massive p2w. Definitely not worth playing. Game is ruled by Arabs and Koreans that spend thousands of dollars and play dictator simulator. I played a lot of p2w bullshit but WoS is the craziest one. It’s pure p2w! As f2p you are nothing and you can lose basically all your power within seconds - anytime during the day. It’s a big spender battle. Don’t listen to accounts here that try to convince you how insane this game is and how f2p friendly. It’s exactly the opposite of f2p friendly. In this game resource tiles and f2p are the same.
this game is pretty fun

Boring game.
This game sucks. The devs are greedy.  I have spent way more on this game than any other i have ever played.  I accidentally purchased a 99$ gem pack(worst deal in the game) .  I contacted customer support and they suggest i request a refund through the play store and they would remove the gems.  After getting my refund the devs have now banned my account.  It has been 2 weeks now.  Costing me way more than this shitty pack that i have purchased. They said they would un ban me and that was 3 days ago.  They still havent.
؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟
😊😊😊😊😊😊
This game sucks
The Game is great, but please more hero's✌️
Server #1518 so boring..they kick you in the alliance without valid reason...i spend money on it about hundred dollars..you cant beat other strongest player if you dont have money....fu*k this game
😁
What the..  The ad made me kill polar bears for meat to cook and sell to people and hire hunters! This is different ;-;
😉😉😉
This gotta be like the most expensive hero in the game. And I ain't paying allat for him when there are other heros just as good as him.
Cannot play this game without financially supporting it to get ahead, lol. It really is a nickel and dime venture.
‼️‼️
👍🍳☕💪
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Opsest with this game
Damn
❤❤❤❤ best game
Free they say, that's funny considering the character they showed here (jeronimo) only obtainable by paying real money,  and if you wanna max his power (his stars in the game) you gotta pay like 10k dollars and I'm not even kidding. Some people reached 60k and 100k paying into this game, I don't advise anyone to try the game.
Make more gifts for free players, active players should have some benefits
Yes you only going to get it with money but IAM here just for my 100 gems 😂😂😂 but honestly the have a lot of other heroes without the money but you have to play hard and for a long time to get them and make them strong
Create Lynn animation she is my favourite Hero or I 🔥

هلس جيرمنو
I cant believe ive been playing this damn game for almost a year now. Met some amazing people though and the insane amount of money ive spent will keep me coming back
I’ve been playing this game for more than a year and in my experience you don’t have to pay or pay so much to enjoy this game or even win. There are a lot of events to gain good rewards and resources. It’s a team work. I’m not a whale and I enjoy this game and I love this game and this is one of my favorite games. And just like any other games there are some extra features which can only be unlocked if you purchase them. And no I’m not an employee of Century games 😅 just a guy enjoying this game a lot.
😂
F immortal
This game is far from free it a time robber and you will end up buying stuff to 😢and so my suggestion is stay away far freaking away unless you like spending 100 dollor a month on mobile games
Avoid state 126 lile the plague.
I’ve spent so much money on this game 😭😭
Maybe we should start a boycott across servers to not buy anything until they chill out with the prices or “packs”. The game would be much more fun if they wouldn’t make people pay so much to win. More people would play then, and the servers wouldn’t be as empty as they are. Every event costs money.
The winner is the one who doesn’t start this game yet. You still have chance to not waste money if you don’t start this yet😂😂😂😅😅
❤❤❤❤

Paid almost $100 for this game now 😂

Shshsb
This game all you want is the money you can get stronger by paying for it
I buy packs every week. It makes the game fun and not everyone that pays be in the same side.
Use a rapier to slash enemy huh..hmmm sus
😮
Cool
C'est pas un pay to win, si tu te connecte rapidement plusieurs fois par jour tu peux même prendre plus de puissance qu'un mec qui ne se connecte qu'une seul fois par jour et qui va acheter des packs. C'est du vécu 😉
Play for free, but pay to win or get anywhere in the game 😂😅
Free? Yes you can play it free but.. only p2w will win 😂
Op
SVS IS SOON 💪
The game not free by any means and if u don't lvl up fast u basically can't get anywhere
이게임은  많은 돈을 요구합니다  섣불리    들에가지 마세요  사냥조차도  돈이들어갑니다
😂 <---- they deleted my comment.
This game is a lot of fun even if you are free to play. No, you won't be the strongest or anywhere close for free. Womp Womp, but if you are smart and listen to those trying to help you you will succeed
Nice
Send me a gift 32652327 :❤
하하
2x  6 $ pack - 2× 12$ - 2x 24$ - 2x 59$ - 4x 120$ to max this guy which is still good but far from the best after s5 heroes  And you need vip 12 which costs a crap tonne more of pack buying
What nice video for a character you can only get with money.
وين العرب
Im free to play and holding my own just fine!
😅😅
$10k for this hero….
, in the best city ولاد الحاج
All things considered it's a good game but as someone who actually plays it it's hard f2p. If you play, play either with money or play to make friends.
Don’t waste your time. Free players get slaughtered all the time lol. Save your money. Customer service sucks. If you want to win, you will spend thousands of dollars.

Hi I’m new
انا متحمس احب هذي اللعبة 😻
GAME IS A SCAM, they say it's free but they barely have anything for "free to play". They have scummy tactics to try to get you to spend it all. They make you think it's a build your own village game with a false playable advertisement, but it's not. Don't be like me, RUN.

Advertising Pay to Win hero and saying Free to Play. Lmao! The irony
Wow very elegant 😆 🤣 😂

lol this game is brutal u could spend 1000$ on training your troops and still lose em all if someone wants to attack u on their and farm account till u have 0 troops left LOL

Just pay to win thing There is no balance what so ever
Play for free 😂😂😂😂😂
I hate this fucking game. It's full of toxic players that pay-to-win. Do not bother playing this, it is not worth it at all
I love the game but that you can have 2 heroes (the one showed being one of them) only by paying is a disgrace
This advert is a lie, Jeronimo is not free , you have to buy it in game. You cannot progress as a f2p player. The game is a cash grab with expensive packages. F2p players power  are disadvantaged vs p2w players. This game is ripping off these p2w players.
I play it and I have never paid anything. And I never will. I'm working on my level twenty six furnace.  I guess if you are easily manipulated then stay away.
The balls of them to show off one of the pay to play characters and advertise the game as "free"
They have to pay themselves, people. Nothing is really “free”. You can still have fun playing without paying. When I was younger, you had to pay every time you played a game. I don’t mind sending them the money I think is commensurate with the enjoyment I get from the game. I just so glad I don’t have to watch adds EVER when I play this game.
Play free, but you can't get this character free, lol
It isn't pay to win . Your chief isn't doing his job if you have to pay money to play in the alliance your in. I'm a chief nobody in my alliance pays money were strong doing great 33 days in settings all the gems they need to level up vip 25k a week . Each player.
Good game, very nice as F2P. 👌  Luckily it's always balanced 🙏
This is a safe place for the victims of thinking this game was about collecting wood to grow a camp and fire.
I have him but not maxed out hard to do
Me and lots of players are going out cause its not free to play and is pay to win 😂
You don't slash with this kind of weapon. It's an estoc (thrust) weapon.

lose a lot of players because of your love of money
Without buying it’s hard to build when you hit the higher levels
Not for free to play players

play free but when you want max jeromimo you must be vip12 ;)
Can you pay $500 a day… no? Then you will fall behind, even if you dump $20,000.
Yeah right no one forcing to pay, but the developers making people mentally forcing to pay, lots people I can see here saying no one forcing, dude no need to tell others to pay, u can force anyone to pay mentally and this is what developers r doing👍🏼
詐欺広告が多いゲームです。
اعلان ممتاز
Worst game out there. I swear anyone that talks good about this game works for the company. It’s the same boring events over and over. Same endless buttons to click that eventually drive you mad. And I told care what anyone says, this game is all about gross enrichment. You cannot get ahead or come close to enjoy playing unless you put in a minimum of $100 month, probably closer to $200. The game harasses you about money. Everywhere you look, everything you click, money. Five hundred different ways to give them money and what you get in return for those purchases is a joke. The game should be shut down and the makers thrown in jail. Do NOT let yourself get hooked and brainwashed. Buy PS4 games for crying out loud. This game is barely even interesting.
Hey from FLM ❤
😮
You can download it for free but that’s how far it gets!   It’s a HUGE pay to win game with unfair pricing system. Depends how much you buying the less it gives you.   Nice concept though
لا داعي للدفع من اجل ان تصبح قوي اذا كنت تعرف كيف تلعب بذكاء انا لم ادفع شيء على اللعبة وانافس في جميع الفعاليات على الصدارة 😎😏
Not free to play 😂😂😂 after a point everything you need to upgrade has to be bought 😂😂😂😂😂
The game is really cool. We can olay has free players but Jerónimo won't be an option there. Sure it's sad that some that have much money and apend it are just mean, but others are not and it's possible to have a good State if people want. The problem is not the money. The problem are people without values and/or without regards for others. That is not the developers fault. Wish I was payed to play 😂 1160 is a very good State. Love it there.
Jeronimo, tu coûtes cher escro 😂😅😂
Nothing is free.. still it's free 😂😂.. pay pay pay or it's so difficult lol 😅😅 But the game is really good to play...😂
Pay To Win game.

This game is not for free play.
Don't recommend this game at all. I say this as someone who plays every day bc at this point I have sunk thousands of dollars into it. Ofc you don't have to pay but there's always someone bullying you that's bigger so you want to try to become stronger so you can defend yourself. The game is a money pit. I just sunk over $100 into the Halloween event and I am not even going to get the limited time cosmetic skin. The more you pay the more money the oversea players "pay" at this point I'm convinced they are employees who get stuff for free and only lurk those competitive people like me into sinking more money into the game to try to keep up.

Not free it is purely pay to win game. Despite what free items they give its nothing compared to what they want to force you to spend to reach spenders level

Buying is not a must. But more power teams and players makes this game bad. When they attack other players.
