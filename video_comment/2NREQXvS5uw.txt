I don't think I've ever laughed so hard. Those bowls breaking and his reaction got me wheezin
The Nature Boy Rick Flayer won’t be best pleased someone using his name
this was honestly one of the most hilarious things ive ever seen. The whole sequence with the bowls made me die
42:03 GOOD GREIF HES NAKED!
6:58 HIS LAUGH I CANT 😭
12:59 why did I forget too? 😂😂
Job job job, 😂
I love the first game so much. Between breaking the bowls by simply clicking them to the customer starving to death, it was amazing 😂😂
I wish I was like caseoh
dude the jump scare didnt even scare me.. cases scream scared me omg
42:04 i think my heart just stopped.
“Mam please stop crying like you got hit by a car or something!”  CaseOh after freshly running over a human

Multiversus was def one of those kinds of games fr,I'm also a victim to that game and mained Bugs Bunny and nah we ain't never getting that money back for the skins
I’m hallucinuzzin

24:10 my favorite CaseOh clip in the entire world
1:05:11 bro you’re too white , stop investigating and go hide in the bathroom. Like you already died immediately tryna investigate the first time idiot
24:09 LMFAAOOOO
as a new viewer i am SO confused rn.. it's half hysterically funny and half terrifying..like i have no idea whether or not you are actually joking..  "help me! hurry!" "nah, i changed my mind just because you asked me to hurry"💀  "are you ok?"(blood all over the road)  "stop crying!!! i'm going to throw you out of the car!!" 🙈😨
i was dying of laughter up until you said that you were furious with your friend for him being silly and wanted to abandon/hit him for making a mistake..so far this is the scariest thing in this play through🙈 i'm just gonna assume it was a weird joke and in reality you were laughing together instead of this psychopathic reaction..i hope your friend is ok
Tell me why the guy at 35:30 is Jeffery dahmer lolol
41:12 i love you caseoh i love you🤣🤣🤣
tommorow is my birthday!!
17:33 it was "BlueChancey"

Put this on in the background while I did homework and immediately got distracted by "OOH. OOH. OOH. OOH." 😭😭
1:01:46 “can I say no” BOOM 😂😂
this is 1000th comment according to my Youtube. This was commented on September 15, 2025, at approximately 4:47pm PT.
As long as CaseOh and BTS exist, everything is going to be fine
Finally a CaseOh video where he’s actually a average being instead of some big fat colossus guy
7:23 I need to get my hands on some of these they look so good!😭
Case wastes so much time
6:54 W PLUG I THOUGHT HE WAS LYING LOL 🔥
Btw since I saw some people in chat asking a blessing bag isn’t a literal bag it’s just shaped like that. It has filling inside of it.
The “space needle” I don’t think that’s the real one, the real one is in china, idk what is called but I visited china last year and saw that tower, which is not in fact the “space needle”
36: 13 oh no.  If youre a boy. Be careful with him... he even kill 2 kids.
26:14 Aww he has his Caseoh plush :3
The bowls crushings looks more like a joke than a bug....is so frustrating but also funny how casekh break every bowl...like a cartoon..he just put the thing in the table and   Crash
17:36 😭
I was so confused why there's Chinese speakers in the first game until I realized the game name MaLaTang literally is Chinese..
24:18 this is funny because we have something called Falooda which consists of vermicelli, a scoop of ice cream, some nuts and  some sweet milk/custard. Some people pour rose syrup and basil seeds
I dont know if theres already a comment that has this info but here it is 16:21  When caseoh roasts chat
I keep getting sent over here by @reignroots, I might as well subscribe.
Consistency with upload day/time builds trust
28:31 the delivery i’m crying
I really enjoyed this video keep up the good work Case
38:28 stop I had a customer walk in and ask that and I’m like “yes we’re open that’s how you got into the building”
Shout out to reignroots! Love their art now I'm here.
Your Taco Bell story with your friend reminded me of a story with someone I used to know.  We were at a game at the local stadium.  My friend walks into the bathroom and says  It smells like shit in here.  I said What do you expect it to smell like? Roses? I heard laughter in the stall next to me . 🤣😆
0:35 there’s no way I lost “the game” to a Caseoh stream bro 😭
hay case, I listen to your videos a dead night with my sound all the way up and the hole naberhued hates me lol
This is how I learned Multiversus shut down, I guess LMAOOOOO I haven't played in like.. Over a year, but I thought I'd eventually go back. Guess not 😭
I LIKE CASEOHH
6 7
13:30 😂😭
7:30 I will buy plenty of ur noods..if u give me atleast 15% off starforge system..I forget which one but if u did I would buy it right now
Case's gifts either come from a "Lauren" with 3 kids, "Josh" who is 8, "Caseohsbootyhole", "Bootylicker", "Feetsmeller" or John
Spooky time!!!
27:17 yes😔 i cried a lot because of this 😭
42:00  it was the combo of caseoh’s “oh my god” and the scare that made me jump from my seat 😂
Hi Caseoh love your videos man
Case why do you shout so much lately 😩😩😩 I wake up constantly lol
“Why do you look like caseOh” wha

I genuinely enjoy every game you pick to stream. W gamer 💪🏼

caseoh honestly makes me laugh till im sick bro-
typo: cereal killer
I just died 32:37
47:54
I now just figured out why it's called white coat red hands. It's because the doctors hands are red because they hit/killed the lady. Differ endings. And the white coat for being a doctor. Clever name devs.
42:02 I have never been jumpscared more in my life
16:13
I used to work at Luby's Drive thru. When it was closing time, the lobby closed but the drive thru had to stay open and serve all who waited. So they'd send me to go out and block the end of the line and tell them how many cars were left. I was the fastest runner and could take the order and cash out at once.  So when the last car left, I ENJOYED telling the customer that they thought they were slick to leave. I'd tell them "Sorry we're closed, that's why the cone was there." They always claimed to have been the last one lol. I'd reply, "Actually, I was the one who was told to put the cone out and the car before you was the last one."
33:20 "Hi, please give me an Explosively..." ...Diarrhea! 😂
The plates breaking has me cracking up😂
19:42 oh…

Bro's built like a copper golem 😂
Hey caseoh. I have a question for you. Do you have Still all these books from Adam about diabetes?
8:14  WHY DOES HE SOUND LIKE THE DEER FROM 99 NIGHTS…………
The door flashed white
His car insurance money rant was the realest thing ever. The amount of people that have the audacity to actually do this and say that they broke their necks or they almost died when really they know it was their fault.
Mam stop crying like you just got ran over it's not that serious 😂😂😂 I think it is she's bleeding 😂
67 MUSTARRRRD
