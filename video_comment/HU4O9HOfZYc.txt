so u just proved that unreal is a no skill and no flex rank bc u can reach it by just playing safe
bro is better than me, this thing is he doesn't touch his keyboard I do 😅
Guys did you see the picture in the back 😮
Sad
Shitting and dying🗣️
This is an WR I think
fortnite is officially a no skill game
It os easier to get to unreal than to get to bronze 1 hs
the definition of unemployment
That’s crazy and I will use code lazar
just couldn't do it in under 300 games tisk tisk
this dedication deserves more to him. he missed new years AND christmas. good man 👏👏👏👏
BRO VINDOLY ROSTIDED YOU
Bro is a legend
We all know aid is going to go to the comments and say “are you sure about that record lil bro…” 🤔🤨
Unemployment final boss😨
Bro it literally took 1/2 of what it took to get to bronze 1 1 percent
He has to much patience and to little at the same time bro
Thats why fortnite is bad😢  Just doing nothing gets u to unreal bruh
Yo
Bro is just doing side quests
❤️
I tried but failed
😂
If this comment gets 5 likes lazerbeam should do it in this season
😂
yes cuz fortnite is garbage game - made for 10yo kids
And then his rank got reset….
Go from unreal back to bronze or whatever the lowest rank is idk i play grow a garden
Watch next he is going to get unreal blindfolded
2,955th comment
Good job
The dedication
I tried this on Xbox
If I hear anyone say "fortnite ranked is hard" then im actually done with those kids. Ranked should not be like that lmao
true ly unreal
Bo took 300 games to hit unreal without moving and took 600 to get the lowest rank😅
Lazar bean
Next challenge bros gonna do "I got #1 Unreal without moving"
DAMN I THOUGHT FISHING WAS PATIENCE
Bro
Imagine the next season started 😂
THERE ARE HALF THE MATCHES THAN TRYING TO GET BRONZE
🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡
Bro should try and do it in zb now lol
Technically he emoted and to my calculations you have to press b to emote 🤓☝️
What a legend
yo lazarBeam i am such a fan i am a boy am 11 years old and my fortnite name is WaitingBear5751
Bro I can’t even get to unreal moving
no
If lazar beam can get to unreal in 308 games then all of us can
bro u get gold 1 from not moving and i get a 20 kill win and get bronze 3 htf
I played more or les games a you but I wasn’t even elite yet
The fact it took him 300 games to get unreal without moving but it took him 700 games to get the lowest rank.
Bro think he's bushcampdad💀
Cheers to lazar beam he’s tru blue
My teammates here yelling at me since i am gold 2 and mans out here got elite just doing nothing
Thats so unreal man
You need to get a life and touch grass lil bro
That ‘yes’ has so much power, you deserve a sub.
Guess I found one of my teammates
Jesus Christ Of Nazareth Loves Us All! REPENT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE! AMEN JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH!❤️🙏❤️☦️🫡✝️❤️🙏❤️
BeNos
You inspired me to try this so far im plat 3
Bro took AFK to the next level
Being lazy actually paid off
crazy how bro got top rank sitting in a tree but half the players cant get out if plat lol
Almost a year
Does he actually do this in his free time?😅
Bro PLAY WITH A CONTROL🤬🤬🤬🤬
Fake
U need life bro

Wait a minute how could you do that if the rank restarts each season?
It took him years
This shit crazy tho mad respect 🫡
Never regret you life in the past or present  Lannan: I MADE IT TO UNREAL WITHOUT MOVING AFTER 4 MONTHS
A other guy helped him he got in his game and gave him the w
New go and tounch grass

Congratulations. Now I'll opt out of seeing any more from you.  Bye! 😅
Bro is not bushcampdad
Bro is unreal
you know thats crazy he somehow became unreal without moving whelie us sweats be playing everyday 💀💀💀💀
Bro sounded like megatron when he "beat" optimus in transformers prime. YESSSS!!
Lazar the 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
“I have unreal, I’m obviously better than you”
My name is Lazar too
Bro has no life 💀
That was incredible so that's why you have now earned a new subscriber.
Once next season starts 😂😂😂
this game has the easiest ranked system ever
Bro do you have a live
Bro calls bushcampdad WEAK
Just ask Bushcampdad😊
I normally get 15 kills and get bronze 3  AND U GET GOLD 1 FOR NOT MOVING  fortnite ranked is so rigged
Rivals copied that but it's onyx and nemesis
Why
Average australian activity's
Now get top 1 in unreal games not moving
Bro you sounded like the boss from tf2
Miss these days😢
better then me and dident move
dang being unreal in fortnite is like very easy then
Unreal without movement is unreal
Bro went super saipan at the end
How can you be in a tree If you not gonna move
If you watched the full vid you'll remember that legend with the guff skin, who sat and played chess with him for a full game ❤
The most impatient YouTuber i know being this patient is crazy.
Bro go and touch some grass
Bushcampdad ❌ Kangaroocampdaddylazar✅
Basically bushcampdad
youve gained a sub for that
Is it possible to only move to get to unrel
I must do that too
Fresh
I am unreal with 200 matches
As an over 50yo mum I mentioned to my son, a looooong time player, I’m sure this is possible- he said I was crazy, thank you for proving me right 👍🏼 Mums Rule 🤘🏼
The real unreal
It took like 600+ games to reach bronze 1 with 1% it took less to get to unreal
Omg getting the worst rank took more games lol
Hey lazar can I help u for this season and do that wit u pls
"bro became goku"😂
Summarize why I don't play free for all games
I'm a 2025 season 6 chapter 2
Bro did unreal while sitting and I can't do it but running and shooting
172 games? Thats 5weeks of loading screen on my PS4
ty for the tip
Oh so this is where he's been.
bush camp dad be like:

DAMM THIS NEED TO BE A MUNDIAL RECORD
bushcampdad
I missed Christmas . I missed new years . ENJOY

0 wins
Wow. Congrats. And the moment is over. Too bad about the months of your life.
Seems like an easy enough challenge, I mean he was sleeping 40% of the time. I’d be down to do this some time.
🫡
Couldn't do this in apex
we have ranks in rivals now
people in fucking  academies  in fortnite hardly get unreal and this guy   got unreal without even moving
Thing is this does nothing and gets gold 1 yet my first ranked game get a twenty kill win and I get bronze
Ur patience deserves unreal 😂
Bro missed Christmas for fornite 💀💀💀
Bro touch grass already youve been playing for days😂😂
Lazar: not doing anything Me: ahhhhhhh get me to unreal already I been grinding 50 years😭😂💀💀
This is why fortnite is a kids game. It was fun when it came out and now it's a dumpsterfire of a game kids pay billions to for skins.
goddam that's crazy
YeAHHHHHHHHHHHJ 🗿
Wow 😂
I used code lazar
I dont even think i can get unreal on 308 games even i play normal
Now bro can finally touch grass

Can’t lie he did this when the game had the most bots!!! If you try this now it’s impossible to make it past diamond 3 I’ve tried!!!! You get top 2 you don’t even rank up
This man can say he's pro without showing he's pro💀

Insane man
Clash of clans players : no one is the most patient then our players Fortnite: SHOULD I MENTION LAZERBEAM
Love your video
Ima try this
You could not miss christmas and to ok you
USE CODE PEAR!
Congratulations that is insane
Imagine playing good as a pro without... Playing
This guy is a legend
He's a man of focus, commitment and sheer will.
Patience Final Boss
Is this not an issue with the ranking system?
Bro maxed out Patience,Perseverance and Determination
So this pretty much debunks everyone saying their rank as if they are bragging. I’m not wrong. This guy literally did nothing and made it to the highest.
W Aussie
bro is in english or spanish
Ludwigshafen seeing this 💀
This made my year
deserve a like
I like your new Fortnite skin I have got your skin
Anyone who isn’t unreal rank is actually worse than a guy who does nothing.
You could never do the in cod ranked
His friend really said no balls
Oh is this the same guy who scammed a bunch of people?
I'm actually trying this in season 6
Good boy
Bush camp dad yo lol but he plays some
you know, you should prolly at least give bro a like for his dedication.
HOW DID U GO ON TREES
Bro made the record of Fortnite
m
Fake lol
bushcampdad
FIRST GAME??? GOLD 1??? BRO I ACTUALLY TRIED TO WIN AND I GOT BRONZE 3
BushDad: oh a worthy opponent
Bro never touched grass
I did the same but only to diamond 2 im not as good as this bloody legend
Christ loves YOU so much that He died for YOU on that cross🙏✝️
It took 8298292998days
legend
Bro why you DID this chalenge  without to7ching grass
HOWWWWWWW😂😂😂😂
Bro spent 320 days and 20 hours to get  the rank  Literally a year
Bro need to touch grass😂
Imagine being pinned for saying use code ‘lazar’
Bro doesnt the season change?
bro really looked at bushcampdad and said "hold my mini"
This ladies and gentlemen is a real chill guy
Forrtnite trash
pov the dude i die to
Lets respect LAZAR getting unreal and missed christmas and new years❤
lazar the legend
No life
Wow.
@bushcampdad
Not touching your keyboard but by touching your controller
That means ranked is bs in fortnite lol you can literally do not and hit top rank what a joke good video to.
Now achieve rank 1 unreal or you have no balls
What about dropping down
Is that a is that a is that a is that a 4090 founders edition
People below unreal “it’s that simple”
Hea just doing sidequests chill guys
bro is inspired by bushcampdad.
Now become 1 one unreal
Cool vid!!
😊 The year is 2025
bro using the bushcampdad tactics
I did that I did not die from people I dyed by a storm
$100,000.000.000.lazarbeam let's go
NOW do the same thing but Instead get the lowest rank, starting at the highest
Diddy
The most lazy and un lazy win ever lol
Use code lufu
🤓👆Erm, according to my calculations, you can’t drop into a tree without touching your keyboard bc you have to at least drop out of the bus 🤓👆
Browse me on famous just  1 day
ummm why was unreal my roblox username
so 8 days cool
Bro chill guy with this one💀💀💀💀
this small youtuber is trying to copy bush camp dad
you  are  bad  at  fortnite
That’s insane 😂😂😂 👏👏
W laserbeam
Yeasssss!!!!
Bushcampdad watching
He really misses new years and Christmas to stare at a screen doing nothing.. yikers
Least insane fortnight player be like
even if i go rlly well on the first game i always get in bronze
This video needs more videos. He missed 2 ones a year thing for this.
bro turned into Bush Camp Dad
my dumb classmate got elite in 600 gmaes
That scream showed all of his anger and pain finishing this
Why does it look like he’s wearing mascara
Bro look at pics in the back
Bro I broke my back on new years
Is this a troll? Is it fake?
Bro broke the world record
You missed Christmas and new years just to answer the question… CAN YOU GET UNREAL WITHOUT MOVING?!?!
Bush camp bad ahhh..
MAD RESPECT
i think this is world record getting unreal without moving🎉
Hi
My mame Is Lazar
Bro touch some grass!
legend
Bro went *Super Saiyan* mode in the end
The true legend is the true legend
Damn so getting unreal ain’t that hard huh
shows that having a high rank does not mean you're good
Bro that not moving rank is better than my career
God ❤❤
He worked more to get lowest rank possible and matches
tuch some grass😂
Yeah… that’s a lot of patience
Bushcampdad is like that
the pinnacle of a sitting duck
My friend got unreal this season in 1 day
cap becouse of updates
So falling doesn’t count as moving???
How.... Many pies did U eat
This man needs a life and go out and celebrate it just game
Try that in Warzone LMAO
To be got gold 1 for sitting still and I dropped 20 kills and got bronze 2 the placement in this game is so bad😭
Let me guess it took years
Ok bush camp dad
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bro why do i not even get above dirt trash ahhh league while this guy gets unreal without even moving
❤😂😅
The season is max 3-5 month😂
Damn
play ml you will feel heel
Me getting 6 kills coming second and getting minus 6%
If he asks a question he will work until he gets a yes
= O
6yh
How to get pined
I saw your son in McDonald’s 😅
bro is truly unreal
This is hilarious, simply because of the fact that there's people out there who actually try their hardest, and get worse results. Don't know whether to feel bad or just laugh about it...
0:21 lucklin pic lol😂
How does he get to unreal without moving and I can’t break plat trying my hardest 😂😃🙂🙃😐😬😕☹️🥺
Bro missed Christmas how new years too bro take a break I'm not kidding bros addicted to it
That's actually wild
If he did that non-stop he would get to unreal in 4 days
How can he get unreal without moving and I can’t get it attall
That one friend Monday night
I’m in Australia is fake
Fake
If each game is 20 minutes, then it took him 4 days of playing
You never thought about just staying in the bus
LAZAR DO IT IN RANKED RELOAD
This is what my randoms do in brawl stars🙂🥲😭
Crazy patience
Lol
Bro is literally dead in the second cut
POV the season ends one day later lazar 😭🤨🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Yes
This guy is the definition of “patience is the key”
Patience is the key to success
God level camping🗿
bro really said eat five star do nothing
No way he missed Christmas and New year's
Nahh let me try to do that
i can't even get to champion
The only legend that pulls this off
Don't have Internet lol
just couldn't do it in under 300 games tisk tisk
only 300 games? i can do that in like a day
How did you get gold 1 at the start 😭 I dropped like 10kills and came 2nd and got bronze 😭😭
I think waiting 30mins to 1hour to find a match is more painful. Couldn't get the rank pickaxe and get past gold.
dang bros patience is like a dog waiting for food
That's a TRUE fortnite fan
I wanna see god game pro vs this guy
More like lazybeem
No
If you ever try valorant just get radiant without moving    Youll get banned like for a year 😂
Bush camp Aussie
World record Achived
Yes
I accidentally got to elite by getting I win with no kills because the last guy died in storm while fighting another guy, try beat THAT mate 😂
Some sweat: im ranked Unreal, im better than you!  That guy:
i miss crishmas i miss new year i miss grass
Bro's is made from pure determination and patience
This guy gets gold 1 from doing nothing yet I get bronze 3 on a 30 bomb
This is unreal
Doesn't bushcampdad do this
I just ran back of your car in gumball3000
But my friend play 340 games in one week
Wow professional no mover fortnite player
Jqidian
Use code:lazer!!
This is just bushcampsdad strat
He doesn’t move and gets gold 1, I get 30 kills the game that puts you in your first rank and I get bronze, while proceeding to win 9 games in a row with high kills and yet….. bs.
bro is bushcampdad💀
in valorant. ur either gon get bronze 1 from being carried or stuck at iron 1 cuz u aint doin nothin
Bro doesn’t touch grads👉🌾
300 games is not that many...
Hm...
This might have been harder than actually playing.
It shouldn’t be possible to rank without kills
Yeah funny enough, there’s a hidden point gain if you don’t die or take damage, so when you think your about to die, leave the game, you’ll get more points
missing chrisymas for that is goofy💀
Him saying he’s not touching keyboard             Me.               Are u sure about that jumping out the battle bus
lazar we all know why you did this          lachlan asked you english or spanish…
I once landed on a tree and was 2nd
Does a fortnite season even last 300 days??
Unreal the good one is champion
Man really just turned into super Saiyan
What did you achieve in your life for...this?
👾
Stolen from an old man
He won, but at what cost     He missed Christmas and new year.
The Gandhi mode
I got elite in the new ranked reload and haven't gotten any higher... Ive had this rank for about a 2 weeks now
Just use the bush camp Dad strat
Me getting a 15 kill win on my first match and getting ranked bronze three
That’s how you know the ranking system is dumb. I know this is hard but I could only get diamond three with moving
I got sliver 2 after a 32 kill win and he get gold for that how
Bro got a bit big for sitting for a year
Touch grass, bro
300+ games doesn’t even seem that crazy, until you realize that each game probably last like 15-30 minutes 😂 this is the level of dedication I aspire to hit
So basically ranking has nothing to do with skill … all the sweats out there losing their meaning of life 🤣
Hi
Bushcampdad who?,lol
Patience:🗿  Sleeping🗿  Sitting:🗿  Months:🗿
Bushcamp dad did it better
DUDE he is tryna trick u bc most sports second letter is o and a and orange and aplle both end in e then the mnost common animal is elephant this is so fucking obvious
bushcamp dad on steriods
the way he didnt move and got gold 1 in the first match while i won mine with 13 kills and only got silver hurts me a little
Never hit unreal
You’re a Bronx
You never will be good
The gaming goat
Bushcampdad: hold my drink 🍷🗿
Yes👍
That yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas was personal
This guy deserves more
Love god
Me dropping a 20 bomb winning and getting silver 1
It’s so difficult to do nothing that it’s funny
Ill try until next year which is 2025
got 12 kills and won my first ranked game. game me gold 1. bro gets it by sitting still. i think it might be time for me to quit fortnite
"YEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" sounded so happy
Bushcampdad and LazarBeam in the same game would be the fight of the century 💀
Bro is the definition of patience ❌ Bro is Patience ✔
That YEEEEAHHHHHH was personal 😂
New BushCampDad
Bush camp dad 2.0
“Not even touching your keyboard”  “Land in tree”
Bro  copy bushcampdad
Pov, season ends the next day:NOOOO
This just proves how ass fortnite is
i quit playing so long ago, i have no idea about the ranking system he's talking about. i used to love some 50v50 team rumble before they bricked it to force people back in normal battle royale. it was so much better.
He reveled in a podcast or interview that he used to sit and his friend (one of the best players he said that) cleared the lobby for him
Lazar the goat
I got in your game one time while playing ranked
When I first played fortnite I got the highest rank from just killing just getting the victory royale
not even touching grass
I like how ue disnt even move a centimeter
Low key sad , wasted months for a 1 min video
The shout of all anger packed up in a box and it opened with an ANIMIE SHOUT
I love lazarbeam
I loveLazarBeam🎉🎉
Imagine bro hit 95% champ and a new season came💀
Bro im from Serbia and my name is Lazar
Imagine if it was 1cm that he moved😅
Im going to do that
You're crazy
I can’t believe he missed Christmas and new years for that😭
He misrepresented a lot on that video.   Weird that I’m pulling it up but it’s weirder that he lied about it…   He got to a high rank in about 178 games, then said the final two ranks took hundreds of games, but actually took less than 150. I know it seems petty to point it out but I’d argue it’s worse to not only lie to add to the drama but to lie then show the actual numbers so we can all see you lied.
Bushcampdad
lil bro i did the same thing in 307
Was I late
Wow
stupid game
Wow you’ve got a lot of free time
I’ve played more games in that. I’m still not unreal.
Bro, my mom would be cracked at this game if this were the case
2
0 builds would mean no one would be trying to break your tree unless they see you
I hate fortnite but I’ve always loved lazar he’s dedication is immaculate even after all these years
Think about this being impressive while I think what bushcamp dad has been doing is more impressive
I watched this video
This man didn't even use Subway surfers gameplay
😅Seen you on Mr. Beast's channel on a raft.
❤❤❤❤
😮
this is called camping 💀
Thats something Bush camp dad would do
I subbed
1.79e308
And how did you get to the tree of you dont move a muscle
lol
He took Eat 5 star do nothing seriously
Bro unlocked super sayian
Just sit down 🗿
We need more guys like this 😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍
Bro he does better while not moving  that actually playing
As real as Mr. Beast
This videos deserves 40m likes, like man he missed out Christmas and New Year’s Eve!
Def a bad ass achievement ngl
Crumbl Cookies
Bushcamp dad is back in action! Unreal dedication and patience, truly impressive.
I cant riech unreal 😂
RESPECT🎉😬😎
LazarBeam, I tried this and it was very boring and I didn’t even make it to unreal😂😒
What does that mean? Never played that game
It’s all fun and games until next season
Unreal-istick
Now that's unreal
Why can I win a match with 9 kills and get silver for my first ranked game of the season
God loves you
Bushcampdad is laughing right now
wowoowowow
W1nz he is doing and win
the fact thats hes only spent almost 5d overall time for this vid
So sad to see no life like that
Go
How does lazerbeam get  unreal with out moving meanwhile us sweating our balls off just to hit diamond 3 just to go back to diamond 2
Bushcampdad whorty opponent
Bro is Australian after all
That’s crazy almost one year 😂
Girl: She must be cheating on me Boy:
Just use a controler😂
Bro need to touch grass now
HE WAS GIVEN GOLD ONE ONE DIDNT DO SHIT I DROPPED A 20 BOMB WIN SOLO AND GOT SILVER 1?!?!?!?!
It is I already tried it
This just shows you don't need any skill to get to the highest rank in fortnite
That should teach you something about skill based matchmaking, matchmaking in general. Also skill doesn't matter, engagement does.
Really? even with 10 minute average games, 8 hours a day  that's still over a year of not a single day off.
Top 100000 player right here one of the best in the world got to this point without moving
Holy shit this is so dumb but for some reason, I can't stop watching.
Bro higher rank than most of us without moving
This man is in the history books
Bush camp dad does it all the time…
Good job! The discord mods are going to be sooo proud of you!
This just proves rank doesn't show skill in fornite
What is ACTUALLY impossible is CS2 Global Elite without moving
Valorant kicks me and give me afk warning if I take a piss in a ranked game 😂
Win a game of Fortnite reload without moving
That’s about my average amount of games per season, so it’s about like 120 hours
Bro gave away one of his best videos in a short
hi
Bro got an extended season 💀😭😭
Get a pro player to protect you.
I just realized that I am so bad at this game, that a man who didn’t even move.. is a higher rank than me
Captured the problem with the world today.  People expect what he achieved in real life,  ultimate achievement by doing nothing.
Tryna become bushcamp dad😂
308 games. “It took MONTHS”
That show that fortnites ranked system is trash
Wasn’t in gold after a 12 kill victory… interesting mate.
Meanwhile lofo rage quiting😂😂😂😂
This Aussie is probably the best Youtuber out there right now,  Btw. As a german it didn’t felt as bad as I thought, liking this video. Complimenting a nation, as long it isn’t England feels surprisingly acceptable.
I got my father pregnant this comment will be lost forever
Bush camp dad
And he still got unreal before lufu did😂
It's all good till rank resets
Hey did anybody see lachlans face pic in the back
The patience he has to do this! WOW!
98,000 people have the highest rank in the game💀
Only 308 matches? Wtf
heres how to actually win english or spanish in fortnite 😂
Gratz you did what bushcamp does everyday.  Now return to working on your game
I’m in unreal
Bushcamp lazer

Lazy lazy lazar
You are the fucking bloody legend for a reason give this man his medal fuck the medals give this guy fortnite❤❤❤
That’s so unreal bro
landing needs to touch ur keyboard
With moving i cant evrn get gold 1
Roblox afk simulators if it was in fortnite :
Really, what a waist of time. You could use that time to learn a skill.   STOP DRINKING SODA.
I
Bro copied bushcamp dad
Bro took English or Spanish to next level
Nah fortnite should make a statue for this guy in game
The true unreal here
Try duo with bush camp dad xD. A win win situation of hiding only.
Bruh i got unreal its not hard
Your amazing dude
Hold up, so i can just cheat ranks?
I can’t believe he actually did it
At last he sounded like rick screaming 😂
U may not want to collaborate with this guy but he’s a content creator in desperate need of some help lazarbeam please collaborate with Joel the poel
Laser
You are better than Lachlan
Bro has godly patience
Did you play build or zerobuild

My mayne screamed like dio😂😂
Now go touch grass
THIS MAN DESERVE 1B LIKES
I have seen that video
bushcampdad:
He got to elite in 172 games without moving i got to elite in 410 games trying as much as i could
Ya
And people say fortnite is hard 💀
lazerbeam nah Lazercampdad yes
Bro need world record now
Cheap version of bushcampdad..
😮😂
This guy skips family skips party skips friends skips himself for our entertainment, can we give respect to this guy.
Kids spending more than 2 years just to get to champion after watching this: 🫥😐😑
So, not moving is how i get out of Silver 2???
I got flashbanged in the first few seconds
You move when you land

Bros copying bush camp dad
Nobody, absolutely nobody, Fortnite players: FORTNITE RANKED IS HARD CSGO AND VALORANT ARE EASY!!!
Bro took english or spanish on a next level💀💀
The fact that this is even possible is insane
Bushcampdad:  You forgot me kiddo?
Bro missed christmas and new year just to play a game and create a 1 min video.
BushcampAustralian
If every game was 20 minutes, it would’ve taken him 290 days
And good
Good
English or Spanish?

Easiest game to rank up
English or spanish be like💀
101 hrs played/4 days
Only 308? 😂😂 Gold 1 after not moving for 1 game? When second to highest in half as many games!? 😂😂😂😂😂 The children's game is strong with this one
Dudes like Bush camp Dad.
Bushcampdad: well well well.... You learned my tactics..
Bro just wasted a year of his life just to get an unreal without moving Ngl you shouldve say that to world recorders
Hiiiiiiiii
I got 3rd in a game and got bronze 3
And I only thought that the lobby ignores only me 💀
That takes determination right there
Gg
Fn is so skills
Touch some grass
Just showing how the rank system is fundamentally broken in the game
Basically the bushcamp dad strat
I want patience of his level 💀
I said English or Spanish
Copy of bush dad😢
Do it again next season but push a new clash Royale account while you wait
4.2 days
First game i was given bronze 3 after a victory royale with 10 kills
Guys let’s get this vid to 1million likes
If my calculus is correct you played for about 6,000 hours
Bros trying to make us lower ranks feel bad 😭 I’m platnuim 3 with trying  Although to be fair I only started playing less than a year ago so yk
Meanwhile my skill issue friend with over a 1000 match’s played: 👁️👄👁️
Bush camp dad better
BushCampDad....
he was taught in the ways of master bush camp dad
The season resets💀
Bro is the AFK GOAT!
bro is bush camp dad but not moving
bruh i got silver 3 when got 1 place and 14 kills
HE GOT GOLD!?!? I dropped a 40 bomb in unranked (on my first ranked match ever) and i placed first to and got bronze 1😭😭😭
BushCampDad
This guy would do anything for us viewers even he missed Christmas and New year's (probably) but keep it up lazar beam ❤️❤️
I wonder what nick eh 30
If people say getting to elite is difficult it’s not. If your halfway decent at the game you’ll do it. I’m not even that good and I did it in 2 days.
Bro is tree camp dad LMAAO
Lazar you in top for that tell me your ways
Missing Christmas and new years?  Bro's patience is immaculate and the short blows up🫡
U have so much patience
What associates this video with you?  -Patience is the key to finding the patterns...
Bro u are not abo falah
Hhhh
Bro took classes from Buddha and Mahatma Gandh!
A year has 365 days so you didn't miss it
Ain’t no way bro Gained over 2k hours by doing this
He's a man of focus, commitment, and sheer fcking will..   Yeah. That guy is John Wick right there!
I won with 19 kils and i were silver1
Practically bushcampdad lol
bro become eren yeager
Why
"Not even touch your keyboard" Controller players: at least i can shoot, build, and jump
Bro this need more like than this has
308 matches is 1 month top, dafuq is this guy yapping about months after months?
FORTNITE RANKED IS BULLSHIT I GOT FUCKIN 17 KILLS AND I GOT TO 3RD FUCKING PLACE AND IT GAVE ME BRONZE 3 WHILE LAZAERBEAM DIDN'T MOVE ONCE AND GOT GOLD 1
touch grass (not serious)
Imagine you just landed and your cat presses w 💀
Bro upgrade ur setup ur wall doesn’t lloookkk goooodddddddd
Bush daddy
bushcampdad: I see your re using my strategy
Bro took what bush camp dad was doing to extremes
Congratulations
His patience is horrifying 💀
W
This is really unreal
The dedication is crazy
The determination of an australian
❤️❤️
This is suck a waste of life my guy
Try play apex
Hi
On my sons first ranked game he got 20 kills and a win and still got silver 1
Now way in hell you start at gold when I start at silver I
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE NO PLAYER HAS NEVER DO THIS
GO TOUCH GRASS
luigi could've done it faster
Holy shit man its been a few years, hope you're doing well lazar
Now get #1 unreal 😊
How is it possible if season is 2 to 3 months?
the lads mad!
I wacht this
The man's a higher threat level without moving than my sweaty hands😂😂
Average fortnite player
how did he know were the storm is gonna be
I watched the hole video 😂❤😂🎉🎉🎉
So your telling me you spent 308 games and “assuming” that each game was 20 minutes no more no less, metaphorically speaking you spent  4.28 days, 6160 minutes, 4 days, 6 hours 39 minutes and 59 seconds doing nothing in Fortnite?
this shows how easy it is to rank up in fortnite, and how its not impressive at all to reach unreal.
Hiiii
how many times did he get killed
Bro: Imagine not being unreal you're so bad bro💀 How bro got to unreal:
i hope by sub and like will make this worth it
joy
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
That's really UNREAL!!!👀❤️‍🔥🥶
bro i saw your video and who won the chess match? lokl
What's the game called he's playing
What's the game called vpls
U
Bushcampdad
Bro said " f@&$ being a sweat I'ma be a chill
bruh, i am sweating, training everyday but i can't complete more than gold
bruh fortnite is the only game you can get the one of the highest rank just by existing
This is a new world record👏👏
Start now ye ye ye I am s menace
Bushcampgrownman
Guys Lets make a NERF MINER CHAIN
Bro is a real gamer for that patience👏👏🥇🥇🏆🏅🎖🎉🎉🎉
I’m convinced laser beam single handedly made epic update the rank system to make it harder.
A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis. Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[4] Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the "grass" of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style. With about 780 genera and about 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family. Only the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species.
Imagine if you got to champion 98 percent and then the new season began😂
The only thing unreal here is this man’s dedication
Like UE
Bushcamp dad: "are u challenging me?"
Yessss🎉
Bro did even moved an inch
Now thats really "unreal"😅
Near a year bro
I'm DaChing
Hero: "Hes too fast i cant hit him!" The villain:
100 missed calls from bushcamp dad
Bro got infinite time and patience
I have got to try this
Proof that unreal doesnt take skill
fortnite ranked system is horrible
Yes you did it so yes
e
"Missed Christmas, missed New Years" ya it happens when you dont grow up.   Touch grass kid its not that deep.
Man lazarbeam never give up i love him he deserve 100m sub❤🎉
Heahhhhh
Can I add you as a friend in Fortnite because I’m wearing your skin right now and I’m playing that slap game you was playing?
Bro gets gold 1 first try when I actually try and play the game and I get bronze 2
why did you miss new years?
Bushcampdad dads been real quiet since this dropped
How did u jump of the bus without touching ur keyboard
The account must be expensive
How
Me so can't you get in a center then played with other device and die when you and you are only alive then die in the other device
Bushcampdad fr
Whi is he sounding like an anime villain at the end 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
His patience is more then my whole life😂😂😂
Me: *Does a very good match but gets Bronze 2* Meanwhile Lazarbeam: *Did not move a single time and gets Gold 1*
Respect
I can't even get champ....
he screamed like jingwo at the end
Goat of screaming
It's funny He completed it on my birthday
Are we not gonna talk about how there are people behind him in rp 😂😂
bush
Joe rogan and you need to meet
i luf you
Good Job but why
me thinking it’s insane that I hate diamond at the end of the season, meanwhile, LasarBeam and Bush Camp Dad are doing this.
S
Bro literally became bushcampdad😂
I tried this it's takes forever but worth it give lazerbeam lots of love for doing this he Is the best
This is inspiring, I'ma try it I'll come back once I made it to unreal
lol
Yo bro, not moving is don't mean that you can't invite friends to help you cover you. I guaranteed it is hard to reach that without such help
Omg I barely got to unreal playing as sweaty as I can
bro its fake if you cant toucht your keyboard you cant jump out of the bus and land in a tree   .
Can you send me a gingerbread sliding mitt
Are you bushcamodad
Bro deserves a sub for this one.
Interviewer :what inspired you to do it Lazarbeam:BUSHCAMPDAD
bushcampdad laughing in the corner
Why just why
why even try
That scream was so good🤌
YES IT IS
Yoo Laki i am from Serbia. O izvini zaboravio sam da pricas srpski.
Well You're means you are and your means means the person owns or has it
He was moving. He was emoting.
You should play with bushcampdad
Oh yeah he's doing the Bushcamp Dad strat.
I will show this video to anyone who uses ranks as a skill measurement
I love you
And people Flex being unreal😂
yes
Bushcampdad does it better
🫡🫡🫡🫡
Maybe I should try fortnitw
Wanna know what's bullshit? He played a game without touching his keyboard and got gold II right? Well my first match on ranked when I was unranked I got over 7 kills and assists placed second and only got Bronze II when I was in a diamond lobby
The 2,000 people who worked hard to get unreal just for lazarbeam to pass them WITHOUT Moving 💀
Bushcampdad will be happy
So you are copying bushcampdad
Dude this game's ranked is a joke
i would think this was impossible...until... lazar
Dang he is good by sitting
These guys are getting desperate for content.Sitting still to get to the ultimate rank.Get the hell out of here
I idea for achivement name "Patience is the real challnger" Get in top 30 without move the hole rounde. Thing that send up in air and all won't counte.
Get apex pred by not moving now.
bushcampdad 2.0
I play Fortnite like hunger games. It’s about survival not killing
Isn't this what Buschcampdad does?
Bro is not bush camp dad.
steven hawking playing fortnite:
Bushcampingdad would be proud
Basically bush camp dad
bushcampingdad  does this as a every day thing
why didnt u go to christmas and new years u could've kept playing go to the events and come back
Bush camp dad be like use green skin
Play black ops bro that's a real shooting game😂 fortnight is trash asf 😂
Just goes to show how well designed and competitive this game is.
The bush camp dad method
How did season last long enough for him to accomplish this 😂
Okay.
Give this man an award, saw people tweek after 10 straight losses
Bros bush camp dad
"dude you got beated by a guy that didnt even move the whole game"
Nice
what a nice ranked system
It took him around 2-5 days
You’ve outdone yourself!
It might be but it is prb not post Al for you to pin this comment that is a challenge btw
Wow so how apex old rank was lmao
Tiny task join the chat 🗿
Lol, This is just 80% of LazarBeam's Fortnite content.
Can we all take a moment he missed christmas and new year for us
So ur telling me I’m better off not moving if I want to climb 😂
I see, you too have the soul of luigi
Bushcamp dad casually existing : 🗿 🍷
So how are you famous? “Lazerbeam”is sat in a tree for 3 months
Pov: the unemployed friend on a tuesday (joke)
Fornite isnt shit its good Fortnite:
Bro its time to move from fortnite. Try something different.
How did bro get gold one in a match where he did nothing but in my match where I got a victory royale I got bronze 3.
1v1?
I remember this in chapter two season two when u tried to win without moving and then u unplugged fresh's keyboard lol 😂
He needs to learn from a certain dad
But why tho? Why? For what reason?
i dont know
wow 😮
Bushcamp dad did this
Bushcamp dad strat
HOW DO YOU GET GOLD 1 JUST FOR STANDING STILL AND I GET BRONZE 3 FOR 3 KILLS AND PLACED 11th BRO WHAT
Sad copping bush camp dad
copies bushcamp dad with no shoutout, cmon man
"hello everyone rear admiral jingles here"
Mom i want bushcampdad  Mom:we have bushcampdad at home bushcampdad at home:
Im sorry for him
Bushcampdad enter chat
Bushcamplazar
bro is NOT bushcampdad
While its cool you pulled this off it absolutely means anyone can make it to the top with or without skill and respectfully thats wack
Technically bushcampdad
This guy needs therapy or a life 😅
TLDW:  he did it, but Bushcampdad did it better.
This just proves that Lazar is so powerful that he doesn't even need to touch his keyboard
Does rank reset after a season?
4 days ingame for unreal
fortnite ranked is so biffed i got a 12 kill game "fake" crown vic while unranked and got placed in bronze
TreeCampLazar
BushCampBeam 💀
no way💀
Now i can upgrade my bronze 3😂
Season 17 of apex pov
Sooooo.....you're just copying bushcampdad
Do it again!❤
Nobody talking about posters in the backround at begining
first game he got gold 1??????? I got a 24 kill win and it placed me bronze 1
Shoutout bustcampdad
Every time you think that you are wasting your time .watch this video
Dedication.
Bushcamp dad strategy
Ayo fortnite players be alert and search the trees
World record have been found.....did you get a award for it?
Well now i have no excuse
The funny thing is that he is now just unranked
Ummmm Bushcamperdad
bro does not think hes bush camp dad
Lazar is a man of Focus, Commitment and Sheer fucking will
Bro has never heard of bushcamp dad
All for one video
😂😂😂😂😂
someone already did thos
Is this man's name Luigi?
funny how you can be a top player just by being idle
broooooo thats crazy
So what you are saying, is you can loterally be the best rank in that game, but not playing the game? Wild. Game has to be absolutely plagued with bots or something.
8 . O 1 O . I - s❤🎉
they fixed this
copy cat come up with something new.... LAME
i cant even get gold 3 with moving (i play nintendo pls no flame me)
Moment
This dude has the patience of a Shaolin monk
Your first mistake was not choosing the alien skin
The Luigi challenge knows no bounds
308 games?? he said it took multiple months? break this down, lets say three months tops... that is about 3-4 games a day.... oh the struggle
bros using bush camp dads strat 💀
*“ I will eat one burger for every like this comment gets. ”* 👇
I stayed up all night and went pools and fell alsleep
Basically copying BushCampDad. Boring. Next.
Honestly i forgot about Lannan, i stopped watching him around season 7 of chapter 1… this is a nice blast from the past tbh, i think ill go watch some old bridge builder vids and some cars getting wrecked for fun
We should talk about brush dad 😅
You are not bush camp dad
Bushcamp dad clone
Lol, imagine copying Bush camp dad for view 😂
Id say this is more impressive than getting unreal normally
Then what the heck am I doing wrong
This is why I don't take ranked brs seriously
He did something similar where he tried winning without moving a couple years ago
If he did that straight with no sleep it would take about 5 days worth of playing Fortnite
good job! get to top #1!
Bro turned into bushcampdad 😂😂
The bushcampdad method
Bushcampdad strategy
This guy is a beast
bud thinks he's bushcamp dad
nice to see this challenge come back!
Bush camp lazar
bushcampdad is better than you
“Without board” Still uses key board to land on tree.  It’s ok lol still funny he ranked up so much
Copying someone else’s shit eh? Pathetic
Now try this with pubg
this man said he got gold 1 for doing nothing i know now that streamers get game boost i can win 10 games in a row and it puts me in rookie like wtf im winning game
that's absurd lol
This is the great value bushcampdad
Basically Bush camp dad
Bro got to unreal rank without moving in 308 games, meanwhile i'm stuck in gold 1 after more than 400 games 😭😭😭
bro is an actual goat
Fortnite is an idle game now? Maybe I'll finally play it.
Bro touch grass💀
Wow
LazarBeam more like lazy mean
literally bush camp dad
how do you do this
Bushcamplazar
Bro got unreal without moving a muscle and I'm over here in elite struggling to get to champion
He is laser beam he can do anything
This man could sit and watch paint  dry that how much patience that man has
If this actually happened the ranking system is obviously fucked, not to mention the overall FFA battle royale format is just bad.
So you get the highest rank doing nothing? No wonder there’s 90k people lol
thats crazy, almost unreal
FortnIdle.
If bushcampdad went super saiyan
That's easy just don't get on the battle bus
Fuckin legend
Now that’s commitment💪💀
This man just spent at least 6,000 hours doing this  Props to your insanity👏
Bushcampdad been doing this.
Bushcampdad be like:
Thats why BR games rank doesnt mean shit
Love ya beam boy😅😂😅😂😅
bush camp dad:
Alternate Title: How to Waste your Life
Touch graasssssss!!!!!!!
Congrats you spent 102 hours on this challenge
Bro I need to do this, I’ve been stuck on plat 3 in the new season for 3 days
It just takes one key it's all over
Code lazar
If you do this in the future just know that you can leave the game in like top 10 and you don’t take any damage at all and you will actually gain more than dying to fall damage or anything
I didn't know it existed
Most fun in Fortnite I’ve ever had
Good game
Bro I could never do this 😂
Everyone is getting inspired by bushcampdad 😅
I tried that and it’s works do it in a bush btw it’s better
Now it's impossible
Bushcamp dad did it better
8
9
now that its season 2 hes gotta do it all again
Bushcampdad did it better. And first.
@sprocket_Band
Bro got that in one season ❤❤❤the determination
Totally not a strategy that everyone are going to use
I thinking was something
fkn bullshit, i play normally and get like 6 kills and die in top 15 or top 10 and i rank up a few precent only
hi
All that time wasted. Bro, get the hell out go touch grass
Play with bushcampdad
Bro thinks hes bushcampdad
Busch camp dad has rubbed off on other streamers (pause) 😅
Bbbbbbruhh
BUSHCAMPLAZAR

Bush camp dad
Can i play wid you i have no one to play with and i only nead one more win
Bushcampdad fake
Bushcamdad;no,lemme teach u the right way
How
the fact that he could so easily get elite doing nothing just shows the rank system on fortnite is trash 😂
Why is Lazar not posting..?? Him: Lad I have a video idea💡
bro really said its to easy
Patience is the key
Bushcamp dad
shoutout to bushcampdad
How you gonna disrespect bushcampdad like that

Bushcamplazer

Sigma
That's crazy!!!!!!
With that patience I could wait for gta6
Soooo bushcampdad?
Scripted button 👇🏻
Now you need to see if you can make it to the same rank in less amount of matches
Can I please be friends with you in Fortnite? Please do it to where you can friend Request me
Yes

😂😂😂😂
My man sounded like eren at the end when he gets angry 😂😂😂😂
New season ....
Eat 5star do nothing😂
bro trynna be bushcampdad
The awkward moment where this video proves you’re the only reason you’re not unreal 😂
I've played 4000+cod mobile games many hours
ITS JUST LIKE THE NAME OF THE GAMES ENGINE !!!!
Bro wasted all  that time and fortnite released anew rank lol
Codm player be like: lucky 💀 There rank: legendery*after 2 or 1 year
Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing!
BUSHCAMPDAD🤨...
Bro is doing the bushcamp dad challenge
I might actually try this method
That unemployed friend on a thursday:
Bro I got silver 2 after getting 25 kills and first place
Sheesh button  👇🏻
The dedication to get something that could fit into a single yt short my goodness, what you did is incredible, yet i think you need to figure out something easier man
Ranked Fortnite is more competitive than ever 😂😂😂😂
SSL is heavier even if you were moving
The ultimate rat
Dont steal bush camp dads strategy without acknowledging the original. SHAME, SHAME
He could've just quit the game, taking damage affects the amount you get.
No one - unemployed guys on Monday at 2pm
Basically bushcampdad
7:32  porque el marco ahora se peina de a sonic XD 🌚
Quitting before dying woulda sped this up SO much.
Ik lazarbeam always made jokes he would sell out for money nd clout buh sad to see sum1 I used to watch turn to a Fortnite YouTuber
Bro trying be bush camp dad
Yes. Bush camp dad wants his content back.
What does that say about this games ranking system? 😅
Man sounds like dio at the end   WRRYYYYYYYYYY-
Bro should get coached by Bush camp, dad.
You actually get more rank by just leaving the game... the bushcampingdad uses this strat and apparently you get more rank xp if you leave before taking any health loss.
30 years later he's the next bush camp dad
This was done already not to impressed
Bro took bush camp dading to the extreme
bro beat fortnite on pacifist mode
I tried this too but l gave up at silver 3
I did it to but I got to elite
bro tryna be bush camp dad
I got second place and eight elims and got silver 2
Bushcampdad has enterd the chat
Didn’t they patch this 😂😂
Kinda goes to show the skill level needed to play this game you literally have to do nothing
Your unemployed friend when you told him to have a goal in life
And your goofy shots can’t get out of silver.
It may or may not of taken 509 games for me to reach elite
Next chapter😭
how u always land in a tree?
Yea just copy bushcamp dad no bid deal. Enjoy my dislike
Bushcamp dad inspiration
you waste thousands of hours, and gain nothing, not even the fun of playing
😅
BushCampDad
So you missed Christmas and New year's that's sad
Man brought out his inner bushcamping dad
Can everyone spred  It
Hi I'm your biggest fan
Unemployed friend on a Tuesday:
Don’t know timeline, but sounds like some bush camp dad to me in a sense.
What in the bushcampdad
ma bro has the most skill in the world
Lazar you should do the same thing but you have to run the entire game instead of siting
🙌
🙌
Tis
Wow what a man
Fuck
I play like usual and I'm D3💀
Yes
Can u add me lazar im a big fan pls watching u live stream pls if u see this , name is YT cLiPpZy
This is why fornite is a joke and no one takes a seriously. You can reach the highest rank without playing...
Bro became Bush camp aussi
how
Bush Camp Dad: “Only 300? Pathetic 🗿”
Fortnite rank system is a joke
He cap he broke the tree at the end
His patience is Unreal 💀
LANNAN YOU NEED TO GET ON THE EVENT NOW I KEEP GETTING KICK
Patience is the most powerful weapon anything can wield. Like, do we not learn anything from batman? 🤣🤣
a true sigma
Bro just ranked up and made tons of money without ever touching a keyboard or a mouse. LEGEND!
Basically copying bush camp dad huh
Then the season resets..
Lol its kinda funny
You never give opp
He gain Unreal without moving and i already have problems with diamond 2
Bro has the dawg in him💀🔥
That’s bushcamp dad thing yo be original
I dont been playing this game and thays impressive.
I think this proves how much of a joke Fortnite is
Movie name - smile
Bro's just copying bushcampdad
Why does your voice sound AI
lmao dumbest ranked system ever XD
Worse than playing a game wrong is logging onto it and not playing, now that's unreal😂
So this games isn't skill based at all, just play and you'll rank up.
You look so much the character fuse from apex legends
Hi
Someone needs a life 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 please go out side
This man must of not heard of bushcampdad
You better play clash of clans🤣🤣
BushCampDad would fucking tear it up in the Australian servers
Bruh took bushdad style. Just changed the name loll
You look like you were going through it
So that game needs 0 skill to play?
Ethanchandl f2
BushCampDad: Hold my beer
That was niiiiice
You’re just doing what bush camp dad does
Didn't know Fortnite is an AFK genre game
LAZARBEAM PLEASE DO A FIRE TORNADO ONLY CHALLENGE! You know how the pandora box opened and there's a huge fire tornado? Well, you should try to camp there and secure the win! Do it for the memes, legend!
Try PUBG its Impossible
So youre doing what bushcampdad does
Stop stealing BushCampDad's only content 😅
That one man : report abnormal data
the stephen hawking procedure
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Would’ve been faster if you left each game right before the storm got you to get a no damage bonus
Your dedication is unreal
I don’t even like Fortnite but for this… for this I will give a like…
if you leave without taking any damage you get more points - bushcampdad
This just proves the awful mechanics of rated
This is bushcampdads strategy for pretty much ever match
“Is it possible”
You and every other apex player in season 17
Proof Fortnite rank doesn't mean anything
wait so bush camp dad was actually pretty.
300 games? Rookie numbers, sounds like a casual weekend 😂
Rip kid KD
I missed Christmas and new years is crazy
Moral of the story : This man is being more productive than you and he's not even doing anything. Just give up bro
The patience is unreal
Doesnt this show that its a terrible game, u dont even have to move to win
So you copied bushcampdad he did it better 😂
Bushcamp dad did it 1st and better
nah yo’s skin in fortnite called laser beam nah lamer lame
No one gonna talk about the fact he is top 100k unreal without moving 😂
No way LazerBeam showed more patience getting unreal rank without moving than playing sidemen amongus with Danny & Jj 😂
Can't believe this workes, I tried and I'm at sliver after 3 days 😂
Bushcamp dad did it first 😭
Cracked
I just watched that other dude say u get higher rank if u leave without dieing 😭 f
i really never thought i woudl watch an foirtnite video but with that beginning phrase you catched me and also gg
This was so hard to do , he did an anime scream at the end
So you tryna copy the legend himself, bushcampdad then, but in an even more insane version xD
Leave don't die. You lose % when you die
Tram knows he copied Bush camp dad 😑
we have the same name kinda
Just use a controller. You never touch your keyboard if you don’t use a keyboard
Copying bush camp guy
L + ratio + no life + touch grass
Would u rather  Do what lannan did Or  Watch paint dry
No one will beat the guy who got unreal without moving
BushcampDad did it better and has and will always be better😅
Impossible? No it’s not. You did it 🤷🏽‍♂️
Bushcampdad already did it before you, good try 👍
I been a sub since 1m
how'd you get in a tree if you didn't move?
Bro stole bush camp dads whole mojo
This is why Fortnite is dumb in ranked
bushcamp dad
Try without play
Surprisingly it takes quite a lot of effort to not do anything
Goes to show you that unranked is were it’s at
The like
Reminds me of mr beats counting videoa back in the day
"unreal is hard" him :
You gotta leave before you take damage to get the damageless bonus
This man could get unreal without moving, but when i get 19 kills and winning, i lose -10%😭
Our community wants to know.  Why not try to get a win at very least.
I got something better then unreal bronze 4
How is ranked in fornite?  Its pretty good fun nice system  Yes😂
Glad to see the spirit of your madden challenge videos are still alive and well
I hate when people copying other people idea and make it like never happens you are 🤡
Bushcamp dad would be proud
Kind of a good idea
Copying bushcampdad
This guy’s the opposite of a sweat 😂
missing new years and Christmas to be called a no life is bad
Give this man a pacifist medal 🏅
How did bro jump from the bus :🤓
Proof that Lazarbeam was always the best
Bro took "unreal" to a whole new level😂😂😂
Stewen hawking mode 💀💀
Damn this game looks soooo hard
So you basically got a participation medal? 😂 Fortnight FUCKING SUCKS
Apparently if you leave before taking damage you get bonus %
thank you for the idea of a stream. >: 3
If you cant touch your keyboard, how did you click play?
Bro really said getting unreal is child’s play
Yeah I'm sad you didn't even mention bushcampdad
brainrot
That's.....unreal
Bushcampdad is better :/
Me not ranking up while playing ranked
Bro took "Pacifist" too far
No, his patience is UNREAL.
And I'm unreal in rocket racing
Yeah, but can you get #1 without moving?
A whole ass copy video smh. Go follow @bushcampdad rather as he perfected this
You earned it. For real.
Ur insane
Please read this
I’m your biggest fan
HAWKING
The most dedicated man in the world
wow such an original video .. NOT
It is possible. I tried it.
If you quit before you take damage or die, you get more %
Bro is david goggins in Fortnite 😂.
this is *unreal*
copying bushcamp dad trying to make ur own vids from is wild
Virtue of patience fr
sooo just a rip off of BushCampDad
The fact that are 1500 people in unreal that have less points in rank than this guy 💀
so... rank means nothing but playtime
He is him and he knows it 😂😂
proof ranking systems suck
This accomplishment is unreal
LANNAN YOUR IN A MOVIE THE SIDEMEN STORY
Years ago I watched Lazar beam win a game without moving years later I watch him hit highest rank in the game
Damn the fact that you got unreal without moving is unreal
Id take more games than that even with moving to get that rank :_)
Ah...It`s real??
YOUR TRYING TO COPY BUSHDAD think his name is bush dad
Unreal indeed
how many months did you wait to ge5t unreal????
I’m doing a strategy right now I was in diamond now I’m in elite
My rude broke parents are so broke that they can’t even pay 2 dollars for me to join lazar beams membership club
Bro its only 100 hours
make this a holiday
Bro unlocked the apex predator strategy😂
fortnut is doimnb
Top 3 doing this ain't hard. Jus grab a bong and weed then wait...
Bros bush camp dads idol
i call cap
stop trying to be bushcampdad, no one can be the goat
SO now you tell the world and Fortnite is going to 'fix' this for us. Why would you keep telling them all the tricks we use?
How do you reset your rank or did he just make a new acc
isnt this the stragedy of the guy who streams during work?
so basically ranks mean nothing?
Right when we needed him most, LAZAR IS BACK!
308 games isnt thatmuch
That one unemployed friend on a tuesday
This makes the rank meaningless in  my eyes
perfect, now i can finally rank up and brag about it
Bushcampdad!
I JUST BOUGHT YOUR FORTNITE SKIN
Fun fact he just lands on a tree and then do his other works and repeats the process😂 But still It needs a lot of patience
i'm 35 and have been gaming almost every day for 30 years. i'm not sure i'd be willing to do something like this. i dont play pvp games because of their lack of content; so was there anything worth it getting to that rank?
Man's trying to dethrone luigi as the one who "wins by doing nothing"
bushcampdad strategy right there
Bro AFKed to high elo.
Bush Camp dad revealed this
he should be baned
fake
Never seen a better example of how rank does not mean somebody is a good player.
Hello bushcampdad
Yeah it is when the game can adjust coefficients in real time to provide some players advantages (those whom pay money)
Is not it just shows now fornite ranks are fake 😂
now thats dedication
Bro I was locked up the entire time he did this 😭
Luigi gaming
Successful people giving you work advice:
Man ur just doing what "bush camp dad" does.
What is the lowest average frame rate you have ever gotten
Proof that fortnite is not a game of skill and not suitable for e sports. The money coming from little kids made that game go to e sports
Bushcamp dad lite
we got afk unreal before gta 6
It shows rank doesnt matter in games
Everyone: tryhard to get better rank than silver 2 Lazarbeam: sitting on tree 😂
talk about a fcked up ranked system lol.
You popped a squat each match, techniclly, ya moved laddy.
meanwhile in CS you can't even get SIlver 2 without getting kills and playing "well"
bro i have almost 600 games played and im not even unreal, maybe camping is the strat
300+ game is a rookies number ive got 4000+  in subway surfer
Game name?
Yes, yes it is
Prof that this game is easy, just play more and you will be better.
okay then do it without breathing
If you have played more games than that and still aren't over diamond
Good job sir!!!
He will become a good husband😅
sit and die% speedrun
well, it is really unreal
To be fair man I don’t care what anyone says your the best gamer 👍🏼
1600th comment
bro has more patience than i lose mine
So all I need is to at least play around 300 games to get unreal. Noted 😂
Bro gotta chill
😂
bro.. if he didnt move at all, his character would be at the ends of the map
bushcamp dad's student
this is why we sub to you
That shows how stupid and worthless fortnite ranking system is. Gz thats funny as hell
This is solved by giving reward only to last survivor. People would try to survive instead of thinking of it like "lets see how many kills I can get". People would play more safe and you wouldnt get a high position because of those that went risky and died because of that.
🤓🤓🤓☝️☝️actually your muscles are moving if you are sitting or standing
Bro is BushCampDad💀
Then  how did he Use an emote every single round
Kinda proves a bad ranked system 😂
00:01
bro has more patience then i will ever have
انته عدنان
I just did the math and he sat in a tree for about 102 hours💀
meanwhile i can't even get to gold while actually trying
get this man on NASA mars project asap
littel did he know, he was unreal from the begining
This is what i called dedication
Why do you only have 7 shorts
Aussie Aussie Aussie OI OI OI
Bro has an insane amount of free time
He mastered the Art of Nothingness
you like coping people buddy cause you didnt make this shit up and on the other hand didnt shoutout the guy that brought it up
Ah yes the ethical way of rating
Can we please play together ❤  I'm subed to you you are my favorite youtuber
If this is fortnite I'm never forgive myself for accidentally hitting the like button
I remember you getting your first win while doing nothing, glory
The best part is, it's very easy(if u know how to code ofc) to automate it completely. I will try it out and let u guys know if it works  Edit: well... The battle bus do spawn u at a random place every game, so it's hard to code to make sure the player lands at a tree. I did not think this through...
your not doing it right there is a dad that did it really fast
Play rank with me
Can you buy me a ticket to Australia
Like how he didn't know if you backed out of the game you get 10 more % in diamond 3
Wow this kind of time and effort for a short form video.
600.000 like
ez game
Bushcampdad: hello there
Tbh this is why the whole concept of battle royales is flawed and cannot be fixed, there's nothing preventing you to stay in a lucky spot and not move until the end of the game
Love it. But that shows that this game is ass.
wow man that's Unreal
Imagine if someone hit you with a car😅
for it was not worth to miss the christmas and new year
Patrick star has to give up his trophy for “Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer than Anybody Else” 😂😂😂
And people are still failing under gold... Work smarter not harder huh ? You freaking genius
Bs
BRUH
Bushkamper
Let me bring y'all to reality...  FORTNITE IS SHIT
I finally think i can say this... Get a life
“Can I become the CEO of Fortnite without moving?”
This is why Fortnite rank means nothing. I've seen unreal players with a lifetime kill record off 8...
The commitment and patience, jesus
Bro has the patience of God tier
You know a ranking system is bad when you can get the highest rank without doing anything lol
The point is that anyone can be unreal as long as they didn't give up.
Worth buying your skin for
Bro is actually a unreal
I'm not surprised. That game requires no skill.
The true pacifist with weak legs
bush camp dad: Finally, a worthy opponent!
Bro is challenging bush camp dad
This is unreal!
i dont think that 0cm was the amount he moved iykwim
Stole bush camp dads whole flow
So bushcampdad??
Lazar is a real one for doing this
Imagine copying bush camper
The dedication, the patience, the sacrifice 🔥🔥
Bro became goku😂😂
What a terrible system for ranking up, I need valorant's ranking systems in other games.
Unreal
Blud played afk battlegrounds
Your teamates from 1 game to unreal💀
Is it a world record 😂
well done lazar u ripped off bshcampdad
This proves that so long as the coding allows it you can most certainly accomplish anything in a video game.
cool hey her siting on the tree
You have a unique style that sets you apart.
1,500th comment oorah
Its funny instead of unreal being given to players because they are so good its because this persons determination was unreal
The feeling must have felt sooooooooo gooooood when he got unreal!
I'm surprise you don't have a guiness world record
That one dad: your too slow He also did it while working
now that's a way to verbally abuse people online when they suck at a game
Yawn... Bushcampdad's daily training.
Bushcampdad: am i a joke to you?
Without moving it's different because i know fortnite daddy still rotating zone and camping
Guys, don’t let this distract you from the fact that Mr. Krabs sold SpongeBob’s soul for 62 cents.
i am going to say it, people are trying to rank up, and are doing so bad, that a person who did nothing, is beating them.
been watching since the madden days, still great
Average Apex Ranked experience
Hes just copying bush camp dad
This the same guy that would try to run back kickoffs with Tom Brady for a TD, ofc he has patience
Bushcampdad: thats the easiest challange ever💀
what about the storm tho
Why do u sound like an ai
you know you're shit at the game when you are lower than a dude who does nothing but camp/sit in the game without any weapon.
"I missed Christmas, I missed New Years' bro was tweaking fr
I would never have the patience💀💀
That’s why a ranking system in a battle royale game is kinda dumb
Wprd record
Bushman rules mate- *GOOD SHOT MATE-*
if you leave without taking damage you get more xp
bro is the king of side quests
Meanwhile moving with your glider 😘 beat the system cuh them CM’s are nothing like the 20,000 meters by simple gliding actually I estimated the real amount to be 500,000 half a million from 308 matches
the amount of patience is unreal "no pun intended"
Bro He is 20x as good as me without moving 💀
Cmon
fortnite needs to give this man a unique medal for this
This shows how trash this games Ranked system must be.
This is the only fortnite content I will watch: not playing at all
Bushcampdad was amazing at this and has been doing it forever
HOLY SHIT
This has lazarbeam written all over it
Now that's *unreal* .  Pun intended.
Now touch grass
He got the ultimate rank by doing nothing your still gold 1, wake up
i think a dad from a kid did this and is one of the best players or highest ranks if i dont mistake he just sits in a tree while he does home office
try it on valorant lol
that's unreal you did that
Now try that with PUBG mobile 😏
Believe or not this strategy already exists and it's called 'camping' although there have been mixed responses to this including hater gamers wanting to wring your neck
He better go touch grass
and alot of people here can't even win with moving across whole map and shooting people lol
And I can see it in 15 sec
Waste of life
Lachlan Is On the Unreal Reflections (Edit)                this is the edit its just a                    joke
All i learned here is fotnite is the easiest game to rank up in
Bush campdad is proud of you
What a joke lol
308 games is easy, but it's a test to my patience..😂😂
Says long on how shitty this game is.
does this mean that perseverance > skill? or in other words no matter how bad you are as long as you persevere you will reach your goal
Bushcamp dad influencing new generation
So just less than what bush camp dad does
I swear to you guys,i played this one round of Left 4 Dead,i killed the witch in almost an instant,lemme tell you that,i dont know how but seeing her body drop to the ground in just 5 seconds gave me the worst confusion I've ever experienced
This is video is Unreal.  Reaching level Unreal in a game made using Unreal... This is unreal 😌
bushcampdad copy
I mean you have touched your keyboard for landing It’s invalid
fortnight is a joke lol
i seriously fear  for this mans mental state
"the patience on this man". HE PLAYS AMONG US WITH THE SIDEMEN and Dany Aarons 💀 ofcourse he is patient
Sad he didn't know if he left the game before dying and taking damage it would've gave him like a 10% increase in rank
This just goes to show how awful the ranked systems are in a lot of competitive games.
those who know that the old man who bush camped was the wone to do it first
This is unreal 😂
That’s pretty…. Unreal
Inimitable human spirit
i watched this qftee watching the vid
HOW
i’m doing ur exact strategy and i’m doing pretty good i’m almost half way throught elite
Poo
The scariest Animal, He never loses his patience and is always working
Twomad pulled this strat on overwatch
I think this is a sign that slight reforms need to happen for this games ranked system lol
he's just standing there menacingly
not his strategy, he stole that strategz from some older guy and didnt give hium credits
This mans dedication is crazy bruh
Bush camp dad did it betrr
I won a ranked game doing your challenge
I watched full wideo!
Mad respect🫂
HES MISSED NEW YEARS WTF
Jesus Christ love you
this guy gave me the insporation to run down ti my basement and turn my ps5 on and land on top of a tree
thats pretty cool but....
touch some grass kid
this proves to me that even i can do it
I don't know what am I supposed to say💀
Yes it was
“Many days many hours” why is bro spending so much work when there something called a macro
Wasting time for nothing at the end
Bro moved more irl than ingame
Negativity: “you’re so bad that it took you 1 year to get unreal”  Positivity: “at least he reached unreal, have you?”
Literally UNREAL
Bro his patience is targeted by monks wtf
You've got a great personality.
Fake
Proof that Fortnite is a dumb game and "ranked" in that game means nothing
Who's the best content creator of all time it's straight up him
bro is not buscampdad
now time to get top 100 by just sitting
Now try this in Apex
That yeah is insane
ur not moving but u should be mewing
It's always a good decade when lazarbeam uploads
Bro that the badwars logo nightmare
The most intense fortnite match
First video I liked because of tremendous hard work😅😅
if anything this just tells me fortnite is a shit game
BuahCampDad
Bros scream can go into an anime
Bushcampdad be like😂
Cuz need a life this game is dogshit and not worth that much time lol
Literally just camping 🏕  😂😂😂
This is what brush camp dad does
I can't believe 1999 is gen-Z,
"I'm one of the best players on Fortnite." "How?" "...i do nothing"
was bush camp dad inspired by lazar beam or lazar beam was inspired by bush camp dad?
That is the trick a Dad Gamer use.
There's no fun by sitting or hiding even if u reach champion
I have 1100 rankesd games
This guy got gold 1 first game standing still😐 my ass got bronze 2 and I sweated my ass off
imagine if he accidentally hit the w key xD
proof fortnite comp is stupid
Its like the monkey Shakespeare thing
LEMME TRY RN RN FR FR
Me waiting for bro to get on (he said on in 5):
I'm doing the same challenge right now
U get a boost if u leave the game without taking damage. That’s how bushcamp dad got to unreal
first pin?!🤨
this is why you should never be mean to people with bronze rank, because you never know how good someone is by their rank, considering these kind of people exist.
"What are you doing?"  "Me?" "Just hanging around" vibes😅
Bro really is unreal💀
Somebody who just beat me” man you probably have a worse rank than a person standing still” I do
You know, this is why he deserved his own icon skin. lazarbeam can do the impossible.
Reach top 1000 without moving
Hi lazerbeam
Bro is copying bushcampdad 💀💀💀
Fortnite is stupid, i got 8 kills and placed 15th and got bronze 2
now try doing this in rocket racing >:)
Efforts appreciated man...if this doesn't deserve a like, I don't know what does...🙌
this just makes achieving a top teir rank worthless lol. you can have more skill than 90 percent of the player base, but someone can beat your rank without moving... L ranked system
Lazar ur patience is unmatched mate
bushcampdad copie
I don’t care about little game it’s easy I will do it 😑
-Bro which is the hardest game to reach the max rank  Me -Rocket League for sure  Him -Totally Fortnite
Bushcampdad been real quite since this one dropped
LazarBeam: *mid vid* Idk if its possible to reach Unreal    Bushcampdad: Oh no, well anyways
If everyone had your patience brooooooooooooo The world would be a better place 😂
My placement game I got 15th and 12 eliminations and I got bronze 2 wtf 💀
Bush camp dad watching and being proud
Bushcampdad strat
You did move to leave the battle bus
Instead of dying, leave the game at a good placement before you take damage. Gives you a boost in score.
Bushcampdad you dare you my own spells against me Potta???
basically copying bushcampdad
Unreal man
Luigi when he plays fortnite
How did you manage to waste your time more than actually playing fortnite, and is it possible to learn this power Please i need entertainment
Wow that's going to be a new record lazar
Should've only taken ~1 month. 20 minutes a game, 4 hours a day, 308 games. That's only 26 days of trying. And that's generous tbh.
Bushcamp dad be like
Thats only 4 and a half days of straight playing ... strategic sitting
Trees = Bush Camp DAD >>>>>>
bro is bushcamp dad 2.0
who ever likes lazarbeam press the like
That's unreal
You need to go back to doing mc vids they where some of your best content plss
Without touching ur keyboard:  USE A CONTROLLER
Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing
Idk how do i get this likes...
This man is UNBELIEVABLE 💪😲🎉🔥💯
This man has patients of a god 😭
This is why I don't play fortnite
Will this still work ??
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤😊❤❤😂😂
Epic needs to give this man a reward for his effort
Bushcampdad
Bro proved anything can be possible
He moved to get into the trees though?
I cant tell if this means the ranking system needs to be revised or if it is doing its job perfectly.
Those photos in the back 💀
Bros patience has patience
lazerbeam your too late bushcampdad alr did it
Bro needs to eat something 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
You sat and played Fortnite for 6160 minutes
Bush camp dads cousin
I’ve played so many more games than him, yet I’m still Diamond 2. I should quit fighting people
If he accidentally pressed W key on Champion rank he would be so mad
Now go touch grass😊
This is [insert bad pun]
Laser beam is addicted to the game and the way he was happy how he mist he new years and Christmas 😬🫣
Moo
just to prove. the ranking in this game is completely dumb. congrats, you all got out played who didnt even play
LazarBeam converse com a epic para que a loja um dia venha boa
14:00 LOOOOOOL
seems balanced
get rank 1 somehow
bro got more rank doing nothing than me trying my best
Ilsas game was the worst I swear.
Bro wasted his life just to get unreal Good job
yes
Thats why fortnite rank, is shit as fuck. xD
Ok so i get an 8 kill win and im bronze and this mf get gold with no moving
He is still standing
It is
Bro earned that unreal rank just….differently
Didnt he already win without moving at all before
The way he screams at the end reminds me when jesse finally scaped in the car in breaking bad
Thanks for proving that fortnite ranks mean absolutely nothing. Gonna use this video in an argument against a friend at some point, cya when that happens.
he fannilly did... Smoking 100098365D. Me: nice! sleeping: 308761222333334555343+5 months Me: BRO YOU NEED TO SLEEP YOU NEED TO SLEEP

how tf he got gold 1 with 0 frags  in ONE GAME ?
Bro is tree camp dad💀
I am unreal in fortnite

The thing is that he kinda lies to us. 1. He does use the keyboard to jump out or the bus and also uses it use emotes.
You look great today.

This mans patience is Unreal
Congratulations, now go touch grass.

My first game of raked was a crowned royal with 15 kills and 2 medallions. I got bronze 3. How tf did you get gold 1??!
Thank you so much lazer
How😂

Bushcampdad copycat?
Damn that shit really was unreal
He copied bushcampdad but still it's lazar beam ofc it's good😊
Gg
He did fake the first part the one to get to gold but it is still impressive
Battle royales in a nutshell
Lazybeam
bushcamp dad 2.0
the "YESSS" was because he'd never have to play that shit game again.
The Storm:🤫🧏
Blud copied bushcampdads strat
Awesome! Now try pubg
Bushcampdad:proud of you aussie
I love your videos i watch your videos every day
Um actually you touch the keyboard when you drop 🤓☝️
I'm so bored that I have been able to gain the ability to stand so completely still to become invisible to the naked eye the gingerbread waiting patiently for its next rank turns out the gingerbread was unreal turns out the gingerbread was unreal
u should colab with bush camp dad trust
Original bushcampuncle
The true best rank the I have a life rank
Bushcampdad gameplay be like
That's Unreal!
Use Bushcampdad's Strategy
But why?
But ehy?
Is it dedication or is it just insanity.
Isn’t this literally what bushcampdad does
BushCampDad laughing in the corner
Bushcampdad would be proud
Bro really need to get world record
yes
0 fun
Salute 🙌.
Basically bushcampdad
My brother says is not subscribing and he uses code Lachlan not laser beam so I'm so pissed off
Unreal -_-
You get more points If you don’t take damage as well
Bush camp son
There is actually someone who did this
sorry lazerbeam bushcampdad did this already
How is he gonna get Gold 1 without moving but I get a 20 bomb woth a win for Copper
What about bush camp dad huh
Your not bushcampdad
Bushcampdad:😂
Bushcampdad is the inspiration for this
Bro is Bushcampdad on steroids😂
Bro copied bush camp dad
didn't a dad streamm something like this
W
I haven’t seen this man in years yet he is still doing the same stuff 😭
best way to skip full 1 year
So why didn't you spend chistmas with us this year?  I just didn't want to sit in a tree and keep dying to be the best rank  Uhh... I don't know what ur metaphors mean?
Can you make it so if we join the group we get 50 bucks a month
This is brawl stars mastery
Look at Lazarbeam trying to be his dad Bushcampdad
btw Idk the fortnite V-BUCKS system works cause I dont play it so im just saying 10k cause that seems like a good reward for such a feat
this man needs an award for this and a free skin or 10k free V-BUCKS
bro spent three hundred games for a short
i don't like fortnite that much but i love his commitment
Pov: Your keyboard fell when you were champion and you moved💀
stop copying ideas
Bush camp dad does this every time lol
bush camp dad...
Bro bushcampdad does this for a living
Does this mean your rank in Fortnite doesnt reflect skill but just play time.
Man is just copying BushCampDad
Im kinda suspicious that this is ai but it’s far fetched
Unreal
And people still think ranked takes skill lmao
Themaxedstranger is trying to colab with you
Bushcamp dad left the chat…
well done ya bloody legend 🎉🎉🎉
i have 312 games played and can get out of elite
NICE JOB MATE!
everyone gangsta until when you get to unreal rank you get no glider
This seems like bushcampdad
is lazerbeam just copying bushcampdad rn wtf
Now that’s talent 😂
0 0 cm (that my size 🗿) 0
Me who can't reach unreal even if every game I started with any guns I wanted
Well done I am proud
am i that bad i only get elite :(
He's playing Season 17 apex legends in fortnite
This man needs an Oscar for longest patience ever 🤯
bro said yall be better without playing…
1: impresive 2: this is what's wrong with competitive battle royale. Rank means nothing.
This works no cap
That should be my playstyle ngl
yes
me unreal while moving.... lazar is global king
This man is the real life luigi
lazor beam has achieved so much without moving😂
The video right above this video its the literally”be immortal of die right now” over a clip of someone playing gtag from someone called grassvr
Jel si ti iz srbije
So bushcampdad but not move at all
blud thinks he is BushCamp Dad
my grandma: 😆ez for me
how
I’m currently doing that
bro became bushcampdad💀
Broo this maybe World record
Literally just bushcampdad
If you leaved before taking damages you would win like 2 more % in champion
This is why lazar is the best fn YouTuber
My guy skipped two holidays for Fortnite
my friend has unreal... wtf
This shows that u don't need hella skill to get the highest rank in any game
This is not real. This video is fake. You CLAIMED that you didn’t move a muscle or touch your keyboard. BUT, in order to do a emote in Fortnite, you HAVE to press a button AND move your keyboard, AND you have to click start, and boot up your pc which ALL takes pressing buttons, or moving muscles. (Also you moved around when landing because you had to land in a Tree!!!!) THIS IS TRASH CONTENT HE LIES TO HIS VIEWERS
This man is the most insane person ive seen and i like it
One day when i was 5 i was playing on my brothers account and i was to scared to move and the last person rage quited making me win if i was on my account that would be my only win
Bro his scream at the end sounded like he was going super saiyan XD
Mf got unreal without moving I been grinding my ass off and I don’t have unreal
didnt some streamer called gamerdad do the same?
I already watched this lol funny to come across it. But yea he got unreal
I can feel your pain and patience
This is immaculate
Proof that fortnite is too easy
Bro wasted his time playing on Christmas 💀💀 Nah that’s sad..
Imagine playing Badnite instead of holidays
nah cuz im in bronze 3 maybe i should try this
Bro u have to touch grass
He's a man of patience😂
I didn’t even know there was a ranking
Fortnite: hey we are starting a new season so we're resetting your rank  Lazar beam: ffffffFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
🔥
this guy is truly unreal
now people dont have an excuse to not get unreal after 308 matches
Waste of time
Bush camp, dad would be proud
Lets say every game averages 20 minutes, that means all this took 103 hours.
bushcamdad: 🐐
the bushcampdad strat is legendary
TOUCH GRASS AGAIN!
Here's to Lazarbeam, he's true blue!
The Mental Strength Lazar has is insane!😮
This is like master level at pokemon unite
Used bushdad strat
Bro shared Ideas with bushcampdad
Bushcampbeam
I T I S P O S S I B L E X D
Bro tries to yoink Ludwig’s phrase “the plan is simple”
Why sister play Fortnite I think 2019 she stay in the water she won 1st place
Bro is the goat for his tactics for winning
I live in california at 4342 rio hondo ave
Bro is not Bushcampdad
Bushcamp dad🗿😎💀
Try to win a ranked game with an Apple Vision Pro pls like
We gotta give him credit
Shows how easy fortnite is unreal not a flex
This man no life to get unreal
Naahh bro is trying to be bushcampdad
Ask if Fortnite can make you an emote that’s just as still as possible
Congradulations you beated a impossible challenge but lost multiple months out of you life.
It’s honestly impressive how you’ve managed to monetize being lazy lol
Now get 100% unreal
Bros first game gets him gold meanwhile me 12 kills top 3 gets bronze 2 😭
You have to talk with bushcampdad je IS a pro of camping 😂
Apex Legends
i am gold 2
Bro is better than me, and he didn't even move
1,000
The reason laserbeam’s name is laserbeam because he’s always a laser focus at EVERYTHING
What a legend this is unreal
Hi
Bushcampdad strat
bushcampdad
You get bonuses if you don't take damage so leave before taking damage
HEY STOP COPYING THE OG BUSH CAMP DAD
My average teammate.
If it only took lazar 300 games to get to unreal WITHOUT MOVING imagine how quick he would be at unreal by now
Sounds like Bush camp dad
Bush camp dad???
Your skin is my background
Bro became the new bush camp dad
Patience is key to finding the patterns 💜
Lazerbeam try that in real life😂
Pro tip, go to the beach and hire the life guard, he heals you in the storm and usually no one drops there
Bushcampdad the OG don’t forget
Twomad gameplay
yes
yoo its just like apex ranked
Bushcampdad wannabe
Bushcampadult the succesor for bushcampdad
Get unreal by jumping out the bus as soon as possible and not even move with the glider in the air so wherever the bus spawns u gotta stay on the edge
So weird I hit diamond 2 first game and I’m in champ in like 2 weeks
Bush camp dad does this
So I can go 2nd place with 38 kills and get silver 2
Bro thinks he's bushcampdad
Luigi envies this man
Bro did the twomad strat lmao
I beat Lannan then. Done it in less then 100 games on the oldest account i have
Looks like it took a toll on you
You need bushcamp dads help 😂 he gets unreal every season
He is unreal IRL
BLUD BEKAME BUSHCAMPDAD
bushcampdad 😈😈
Touch grass
Real ogs remember him winning matches without moving
achivement unlocked : the most paitence guy
Lazar wins by doing nothing
I thought the man behind u was real

I guess you could say this is... UNREAL
Parents must be proud
Bro says it took months but season is only out for 1/2 months 💀💀💀💀
New name bush camp beam
bro has NO life ngl to miss christmas and new years
Its like a bogur vid
Please a more grounded story and not something that rivals the federation or wants to destroy the federation.
Bush camp dad already did it.
So when I start playing Fortnite I’m just not gonna play
Unreal pacifist route
people really do love shit content
And this is why ranked in Fortnite is a joke but funny to watch.
Little did lazar know that if you died before taking any damage by player or storm and just quit the game you get a (no damage bonus+) and the amount depends what rank you are.. the higher.. the lower extra bonus you get 👍
Lazerbeam V bushcamp dad
another guy:wow hes unreal i wonder how much effort he put lazar:n o .
So basically the rank means nothing and is all about the amount of games played.
Imagine bro missclicked
No shit lazor have you not seen bush camp dad 😂
How did you do it laser beam
Ngl when i showed my friend this vid he literally said "go touch grass"
My man is better than Ninja without moving😂
Bro think he Is bushcampdad
bushcamplazabeam
Good job
Enter bushcampdad =
LOL😂
Ur a bloody sigma
atp fortnite ranked is a joke
The patience all man needs. Congrats. I wish i had your dedication.
Bro i read that as "Unreal without Mewing"
No you guys need to see anoghther guy
This guys patience is UNREAL
i won the first game of the season and got silver 1
Ok I’m doing this now
Yes it
Try that in Valorant

The fact you even tried this speaks volumes
Deserved ranking
Hi

Me sweating just to get Elite. LazarBeam getting it without moving.😅😮
Bro is bushcampgingerbread
Lazerbeam after one game: gold l me after game:bronze I
Bro took inspiration from Bush camp dad 😂
Thats why the rank system in fortnite is trash

Bro is literally @bushcampibgdad

Bushcampdad left the chat.

But u have to touch your keyboard to get to the tree
nhhhhhh bro even iam playing i can't reach on gol
Man I’ve watched him from a child

This guy scarified his holidays just for us, WHAT A LEGEND
Bush camp dad 2.0
And i got multiple kills and a good placement on my unranked match and got bronze 1 lmao
Why is fortnite so easy
Are you serbian?
reminds me of those sitting and smiling streams
Your back
Fortnite “ranked” is such a joke 🤣
b
I watched this on my tv and Lazarbeam is is the best
I’m trying this
Just shows how braindead the game is
man finds the hardest challenge and watches tiktok to cure his boredom
Bush camp dad does it better
What your fear in men is not his rage but his patience
That's depresing
This guy makes a snipers patience look pathetic by comparison.
Bushcampdad did it better but i think your doing it the real way
It's possible but it takes forever
Bush camp dad did it first
unreal… engine (lmao)
Did he steal the idea from bushcampdad?
yo isn’t that what bsuhcampdad did on fortnite
POV bush camp dad
Many days many hours “Many Pies”
Bushcampdad: *scoffs* Pathetic
BRO GIVE BRO SOME CREDIT
BushCampDad moment
Give this man a million vbucks and another style
Bushcampdad would always be the goat at this
Don’t worry I have done played almost 1000 and I’m still Dimond 2 like I’m very good in creative but I’m trash in a real game I always die off spawn 90% out of 100%
Thankyou for your sacrifice 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It crazy how lazerbeam first rank was gold and didn't move I got bronze with 10 kills and got 1st place
Vietnamese strategies
Really shows you how dumb their ranking system is.
That yes at the end sounds like Jesse from breaking bad
Wow so the old guy that only bush camps and got unreal. Maybe try original content
Lazar beam sets his mind to anything and no matter what I takes he'll achieve his goal. Lazar beam for prime minister
😮😮😮😮
Again
I gave up on fortnite ranked after I got like 10 kills in a victory and somehow managed to get a starting rank of like gold
Your the exact opposite of my brothers your extremely patient my brothers not at all
Now ur uploading this😐
You're not bushcamp dad
Now that's what we call commitment
Bro thinks he bushcamp dad

Simple word is camping 🏕️
Damn. Just....damn dude.

Wait until he hears about Mario maker ranking 😭😭😭

The ranking system is horrendous
U
Mans just wicked to himself😅
Get fresh back

Nice vid bud keep up the good work I've been watching you for s long time
Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing
Patient is real
Bush camp dad is gonna be nervous
Can you stop trying to copy Bush Camp dad
I got bronze 1 from actually playing what's this bullshit
This proves how useless flexing about rank is
Shows how shit fortnite's comp is
U have great vids lazarbeam
BushCampLazar
bro i noticed you in a disney movie called free guy
I got a video about the best spots to hide right after this video. How ironic
Sleep properly please
Bro doing NOTHING and is unreal and me tryharding and i am platin2
So we’re in champion
Gaming max fosh
Another day another victory for the OGs
Yo Lazar can I have ur Rubix cube

Bush camp dad
My man try to copy Bush Camp dad 😂
Bro stole this idea from that old head that plays
Copied bcd
Hhahaahaah so good
Bushcampdad
Walmart bushcampdad😂
U should learn from bush camp dad😂
proves what kind of game fortnite is
He couldn’t snip fresh this time
bushcamp dad is the person who can do this
bushcampdad: cmon man thats too easy!
This is what I call addiction.
I have more matches i get 8-10 kills per match but im still elite
seasonal rank reset preparing to give him silver 1:
Sounds like a waste of time
What a waste of time…
Try rocket racing ranked like try to get as high as you can bro I got the diamond one in the middle of a forest with DSL internet on a PS4
Bushcampdad:
Who are you? Bushcampdad
At Some point  imma do exactly what he did because im stupid
Bruh, the sheer amount of work for this 😅
Your not bushcamp dad
Bushcampdad - “🗿”
Yes
Accidently presses w for 0.001 seconds: NOOOOOO
Like and subscribe but I can survive that
Imagine getting unreal after hours and days of getting kills and wins just to see this get it by not moving 😐
Go back to lobby before the storm gives you damage and you’ll get a higher %
Wow legend
patience itself fears this man.
bro please just get off the game and have dinner
Bush camp daddy should get some credit
Bro straight up copied bushcampdads content and pretended it was his own. Shame on you
Bro did bushcampdad but harder
bushcampdad would be proud...
I remember when he won a game without moving
I watch the whole video alr
Bro it rook me 457 days with moving 💀
This juat shows how meanless rank is in this game if you play it a ton. Yes a low lvl high ranked player means something but the more he playes the less you can know how good he is without research
I got 14 kills my duo had 6 and a win and we both got  silver 2 How tf did he get gold without moving
Laser beams better than me I’m diamond three
He copying bushcampdad
The god has posted again
Cap
I think this just shows how sad the ranked system is lol
Soooo trying what bush camp does?
Bro bushcamp dad be doin this long ago.
Bruh i make top 1 5 kill and got bronze 2
You land in a game and nobody is moving at all, waiting to be killed
If ur sad bout missing christmas and ny with ur fam... think ya need to rethink ur life. Never know when it'll be the last for someone.
Your eyes are so red I approve of this video
strategy of bushcamp dad,make your own thing dude
We need this skin to come back
Lazar this would have been so much easier if you had done the bushcampdad strat it's bonus % for not taking any damage before you leave 😉 the game.
Award earned: pasifist
yes it is
🗿
The full videos great
I’m still stuck in plat he’s unreal withoutbmoving😢😢😢😢
Now get #1 unreal without moving
Bush camp dad
he got unreal without moving an inch for the people that are too lazy to watch the whole video
bros playing steven hawking simulator
🆒
This is unreal
Instead of waiting to die if you leave you get a big bonus depending on what rank you are at bushcampdad said this in one of his videos
Now imagine what happens if he starts shooting
I sweat my ass off to somehow keep up with the tryhards nowadays and he reaches unreal before I touched champ wtf😂😂😂
The pictures in the back 😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
Yo
W
Come to Brisbane please
BUSHCAMP dad does this nice try tho goofy
669
Dude you need to give credit to bushcampdad
Your telling me you got gold one when placed 12th with 0 kills when I get 1st and 8 kills on my first game and got silver 2 na that's bullshit
Bush camp dad progression
Yea you can do it
So I could do literally nothing and still get a good rank?
No its apex all over again
An alle, deutschen das am Anfang hat sich angehört wie diese Post 😂😂❤🎉
Least he got a good excuse for not uploading 🤣

Bush camp dad
Bush camp dad Rn hah can't do nothin
Lazar: "Finally 99%!" A new chapter:
Bro doing the bushcamp dad strat
You earned a sub
Bush camp dad
If I had witnessed one of my friends attempt this ridiculous “challenge” I would simply smash whatever game system they have.
That's a real gamer right there
The thing is he is going to have to deal with it again after the next season 😂
this is how fucked up fortnite ranked is.
Ripof bush camp dad
Bushcampdad: what about zero build?
Let’s go lazerbeam 😎😎😎
I have 700 games and I’m hard stuck champ lol
He suffers through the craziest challenges Just for our entertainment
And I can’t get to champion by actually doing something 😂😂😂
Thanks for the tip man it's time to make my friends feel like shit
Here’s a tip: You can land on drones that fly around certain locations
The bushcampdad collab in this video would of been crazy
Basically bush camp dad lmao
Is he bushcampdad or smt
Lazarbeam never fails to entertain us
Lazar is the goat❤️
Its bushcamplazar
bushcampdad
Man really proved rank comes with time not skill
You know if you take no damage or leave before taking damage you get a percentage boost for not taking damage 😐
Happy new year man
This man deserves a Oscar.
You have earned the title Luigi
It truly is unreal
Bro is copying Bush Camp, Dad

Yeah their's a dad that did it!
Bushcampdad

How you get out of bus
Bushcampdad would be proud
This video shows how skilled bushcamp dad is
I got a 17 kill win and they placed me in silver 1 I was so mad
Bush camp dad did the same thing
People who love Lazer 👇

You're telling me....that this man achieved a higher rank than me.....by sitting still??? I GOTTA UP MY GAME

Only if he knew if he left before taking any damage he would get extra points
Bro really gout higher than me without moving😂😂😅😅
Lazarbeam is the best Fortnite YouTuber. No doubt about it
He's back at it again 😂
No life alert!
Most content creators these days: clickbait   Lazarbeam:
I like it how he can get unreal by doing this and i struggle to get near dimond
You are not original, you are copying bushcampdad
Fitting this into a short is amazing
Did they fix this
The answer is yes, he did it
Bro ranked is so dumb
good fortnite
I got put in bronze with a 11 kill win
Bro what  is YouTuber luck my first game I drop a 24 kill 1st place game and got bronze 3 but he got gold one with no kills and placed 12
If you leave the game before dying (so not getting any damage) you get an extra bonus
Blud thinks hes bushcampdad
I'm diamond 3
This just shows Why the fn ranks suck more then overwatch’s ranking
Bush camp dad all over again
How do I work like lazarbeam
This just shows how bad that ranked system is
Best Fortnite player in the world

It took about 300 matches to get unreal
Fresh being like oh you got good now let's 1v1 Lazar beam sorry my internet is me messing up
Bro took patience to another level
He did thsi for like 3 days
The bush dad strat is real
Bush camp dad

If you want to level up and you are in a 1v1 quit the game and it gets you more points
So you did what that older guy did
Im 420
bushcampbeem
Bruh how he get gold one first game i got bronze 2 and i had a 22 kill dub 😂

OKI like laser beam, but he's just copying Bush camp dat.
"YOU'RE SO BAD THAT A GUY STANDING STILL CAN BEAT YOU!"  "Your right"
He is so dedicated to entertaining us that bro denied his family
No wonder bro has been gone
And I get kicked from a lobby if I’m not at least gold. This shows how you don’t even have to be good at the game to get unreal, like seriously the ranks are rigged
Bro lazar just play the number of matches almost a year worth of matches💀
Pov bushcamp dad nah id win
His second most viral vid
Where is CRC repeating this from chapter 2 and i love it
GO TOUCH GRASS😂😭😭
You can get the top rank in that game by doing nothing that is actually ridiculous actual competitive games take actual skill to get to the top rank that is so stupid lol
Absolute bloody legend
Spoilers: he did get to unreal
Bro became bush camp dad
I must give props to the dedication, if only the upload schedule was as important😂
Bushcampdad on top🗣
Unreal is not the highest rank

Bro thinks he's bushcamp dad
You need to do a video with BushcampDad because that’s basically what you did😂
Blud got unreal faster than me 💀💀

Bro thinks he’s bushcampdad

Blud is not bushcampdad

That has to be them Oceania libhies
lazar could you get me unreal im champ 54 percent
Bro has so much patience
that is clearly a balanced competitive system
I kinda hope he comes back to Fortnite memes, but that might never happen. He can do what he wants and that’s fine
Yes indeed, it was possible.
Petition to do it again he cheated by emoting 👇
An old dad did that, he reached unreal while afk in a bush, his name... Bushcampdad
bushcampdad would be proud
Those who watched the full video before the short 👇
Bro has the patience of a minecraft dog 💀
bushcamp dad but no moving

Many years later, he’s back at it again. This man seriously needs an award!
Bro lazarbeam became bush camp dad
Dude. You already did it
"Multiple months" and the seasons been out for not even 2 months
Bushcamp dad:  Am i a joke to you

One of the best gaming moments
You're so cracked
Yoohoo
Thats why the ranked system is trash. Bro i was grinding my ass off to get unreal and someone got unreal without moving an inch 😂😂😂
Your telling me that I could’ve done this instead of losing thousands of percent in champ just by playing
The bush camp dad strat
Lazarbeam would you spend time with you family at Christmas or new year or play Fortnite?  Wonder which one he picoed
Bush camp dad???
Now get top 10,000
85 days is wild
Bush camp dad
Lannan if u dont take any damage in a game get more percentage so u would be better of leaving
Lol this is what bushcampdad did
bushcamp dad inspired
Lufu is better than you
Yes
Missing new years isn’t bad. I stayed in bed watching family guy while everyone was partying
Lazar can u shoutout me
If a dad could do it, so could you
First
Havent played much ranked bht it seems incredibly easy to rank up not matter what rank you're in
These lil recaps💯💯🔥🔥
You Sir are Unreal 🎩
Thanks for the tip man I’ll get past 98,685
Nah this is just bushcampdads journey in. A short
Your goated 🐐
Lazar your reaction is funny as HELL
Game
Kevdog can
Do a sky bass with fresh
BushcampDad moment???
Blud copied bushcamp dad
You are an absolute legend Lazar.
Bro my first game i got bronze 3 when i placed first and got 20 kills
Impossible I don't believe it cause I've been doing that since the beginning of the season yet stayed at bronze so this be click bate so sad when yall streamer ganna put out real content.
308x 20=6160 minutes
This is the most lazarbeam thing ever
Short answer Yes
Pov: Bushcampdad💀💀
This is lame
Yes
So, just straight up copying Bush Camp Dad
i got to gold 3😂
Fortnite ranked is a joke
People thought what buschamp dad did was crazy but everyone knows that lazarbeam will come out with something better
This man is so popular the first second he goes out in public everybody runs at him 💀
Bro was trained by bushcampdad
bushcampdad did it better.
And I got placed in silver(duos) for 8 kill 7th  place  but one knock down. Absolutely fantastic game. How is not moving=better than 7th place with 8 kills :////
Damn
you placed higher then I did when I tried playing the game
I still can't believe you did that
Bushcampdad left the chat:
Finally, no clickbait and this man forgot his family and made it like we were his family😊
So what you saying is this is the ultimate strat, just sit and wait and miss Christmas, got it.
unreal video
Bush camp dad did it first
Quality content right here
Bro things he’s bushcampdad 💀
Realistically the easiest way to get a high rank.
This man didnt move and got GOLD?!? I won my first match and had 15 KILLS AND I GOT SILVER. He showed their ranked was a joke, i am now convinced it is.
Your moving when you glide
God damn
You and lufu going for Unreal at the same time makes you feel so bad for lufu. She was trying so hard while you just sat there.
Yes it's possible
seems like what caseoh would do (he's too big to move)
On my first ranked match I won it with 17 kills but only got bronze 2
World longest making if a short 😂😂😂😂
Egg
atleast credit the grandpa that did this first
Everyone who saw this video  👇
His skin is so accurate that I thought he was at the back, hiding from the keyboard behind a cardboard cutout of himself
BRO I PLAYED 520 RANKED GAMES! AND I KEEP GOING BACK TO DIAMOND 2😭😭😭
Hello
He was datacated to that video
3 vids in a week? See you in 6 months Lannan 😂
He got better than me on his first game....
The 98156th place kid watching an afk guy getting better placement point than him...
Bro sat in a tree and got gold one I got a 15 kill game and  got bronze 2 when last season i was champ like wtf
Videos inspiration from bush camp dad  But challenge is bit more advance 😅
Yeah
Bro lazar is just a bushcampdad but better in every way
Dont die on a low placement leave to get a no damage % boost
Lazzar please keep the good work

Lazarbeam, the only person who can get months of footage and make it into a youtube short without making a part 2
Early
Dude this is unreal
Bush camp dad be questioning his fame😂
bro Im finally able to comment now I was banned from commenting
“Is it possible to get Unreal without moving?”  Me who already watched the video:YES
He said he didn’t move a muscle but in game he’s moving his arm
MAD RESPECT
Bushcamp dad pretty much did this already
I was gonna try the same, but after a 2nd place finish on my 1st game they put me in Bronze 3... I call bullshit
I Don't have an attention span of 60 seconds so I'll just wait for this short to be on speedrunning shorts
Bro took camping to a hole nother  level
Try to do it on EU servers
I like beans
Me diamond 2: 474 matches played🙁
Lawers a mad lad
This is actually insane congrats man. I’m bronze 2 😢
It took 1 month or more to complete this challenge and bro still kept doing this after 2023 has passed
Bro became steven hawkins in the start
Bushcampdad will always be the best at that🐐🐐🐐

Congrats on the unreal dub! I saw the video and I was inspired to play more ranked. Thanks!
Bushcampdad would be proud
