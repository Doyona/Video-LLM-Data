looking back at the last 10 secs:  Max was beating him with volume and body shots but Dustin had that hook in the chamber and just BARELY missed. So technically he wasn't trying to slug it out with Max, he was trying to win.
Max is the best.
I am a DP fan #1.  I'm a Texas boy, so he's my next-door neighbor.  But Max, Max has always been my go-to when he's not fighting DP.  Now that DP has retired.... Max is the man.  Congrats to Max for the win.
I wish max was younger
Nice 👍
"max holloway the end of the day the end of the day 100x
He should be getting seen to rather tgsn an interview can twll he's just had a brawl
Max is cool as a cucumber
Blessed Man Forever❤
"What did you say to Max at the end?" 😅
Dustin chose max because he wanted a fight not a dance
Max take that belt and run!!!😂 nuff, retire!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉YOUDAMAN!!!!🎉🎉🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
The amount  of respect  between  these two fighters.  Is a beautiful  thing.
Wish he was fighting 155 along time ago
MAX  VS. KHABIB. 2026 ?
MAX is WILD. Hes been fighting longer than anyone 😅
Max is a beast
Love seeing Dominick Cruz where he has been all thes years?? Is he retired from commentary and fighting???
Max you have brain 🧠 damage I can tell,you should retire and injoy your family before to late and believe me you will never come back your brain 🧠 will be destroyed for good.
Max is stronger, tougher at 155. Don’t go down to 145.
Holloway - paddy
Max got true heart
I love this two fighters ❤
Dustin had one of the most exciting runs in the ufc. Truly some of the best fights to date.
The “C” icon should be black not gold
Love max!! So cool!!’
BLESSED MAN FOREVER 🌺
Humble Hawaiian!
Dustin and Max are both legends. 💯 They both throw hands and eat shots like no other.💯 Takes a real MFer to do that shish!!💯facts
Give Justin the shot at ilia he will get KOed by ilia and ilia will be fresh and do Max v Oliveira and Arman v Paddy and whoever had the best performance gets the shot. Paddy v Arman can be soon too so they can even go first and max v Charles winner gets next
I do think max probably gets dropped against ilia again at 55 BUT he fought a great fight v ilia before getting caught and man he has way more power at 55. I honestly think that’s possibly the most interesting fight at 55 for ilia. Arman is great but I promise he gets dropped by ilia and Justin gets KOed in less than 2 rounds. Max v ilia 2 at 55!!!!
Both fighters fighters, truly so much respect for Max & Dustin🤙
Max is “The Banger”!
Rankings for the belt? Yes but only fighters who swing! No wrestling or jujitsu allowed!! Let’s Goo!!! Ice Ice Baby!! God Bless America 🇺🇸
"I have never had someone walk from the cage down to us." Max: "Hey that's what BMFs do"
LOVE ME SOME MAX HOLLOWAY
sorry brotha max is my favorite fighter not dustin snoozefest and his presser 1 liner.
Holloway got stupid talent, he can lose and the next 2 fights he's gonna bang anybodies lights out. I mean 20 seconds you no chance and it's obvious. Dude can bang the the lights out!!!
At least DP got his punches in. Max's face looks like a meme.
Dudes face 😂😂😂
When’s Derrick Lewis get his shot at the bmf
The dude is a machine!
People can say what they want. But the truth is, Max beat The Highlight and the Diamond and the Zombie. He beat Yair, Calvin and Edgar. Max is the man. He’s the BMF for a reason.
Mf Max turns into IP man last 10 seconds
this guy is the real deal. love you Max. you are a badass  and a decent person. no doubt.
Blessed man forever ❤😊
I just hope for Holloways sake he didn't jump ship to LW too late w a cracked chin.  He looks like he might have a lil more power to his punches with good speed (not much of a speed loss)  But there are also more heavy hitters in LW who would either give Max a hard time I just hope he doesn't go down the Gaethje/Chandler/Ferguson Route
This fight was nothing but legends giving each other a nice bout for a proper send off. 😭Max trynna comeback in lightweight from the KO loss and Dustin was on his way out. Max got hurt by them little jabs and Max hurt Dusty in the first I believe but this was about respect and putting a show on for the people. Something the UFC rarely does nowadays they just want to bury all the good fighters fast.
Chael calm down when you talk bro.. no reason to scream
Max vs Olivera
Max nice fight
You both are Champs and good people
Max”blessed” Holloway become      Max” the hawaïen pancake “ after Ilia flat him out 😂😂😂🤭🤭
Brain damage!
There both some bad mothaffukas!!!
Max is so much better at 155 he was compromising himself to make weight as he’s gotten older.
It doesn't matter what he calls him he lost the fight and that's it
Poirier and Holloway have always been favorites because they stay humble and gracious win or lose. Congratulations to Max, and Godspeed and rest well Dustin. You are both class acts.
max vs arman would be fire ngl
Who's the guy doing Chael impression ?
watching 318 live was crazy. the look at the clock, dapping hands and then swinging. kings
Max is resilient.. he never stays down in the pit he always gets back up and gets better.
Max is that guy Straight dawg😂
Both fighters are class acts. God bless you both Jesus loves you all ❤
Title should be: Max Holloway turns Heel 2:55
Max the blessed express put up a show bruv crazy fight
It is what it is,  you know,  at the end of the day
These older fighters are coming to an end. Max might have a few more good fights but he's wearing down like all the greats. None of them are what they were a year or two ago.
Both are Great dudes
Max is class
Max stopped being bmf as soon Ilia showed him to the center of octagon and he run away and than lost that fight with KO
My picks for next 3 months period are SUI and INJ. But also, guys do not miss Bellarium presale, is almost over.

Dont like scalp trading and stuff, to much stress. My way to multiply money is to get into the project as early as you can, and ride the wave. Bellarium Network BEL presale is your opprotunity to be early as you can possibly be.
The market is heating up, and Bellarium Network token BEL might just be the hidden gem everyone’s been looking for.
Do not underestimate the power of getting in early. If you are not in Bellarium Network BEL now, you are lagging behind.
If you missed the AI trend in 2023, you’re getting a second shot now. Bellarium Network is leading the charge into AI-integrated DeFi. And BEL is still trading at presale rates. Think about that.

Yes guys I´ve heard about Bellarium Network, it will be absolutely massive. All major exchanges will list BEL
I’d rather hold something that’s building than something that’s trending. That’s why I chose Bellarium Network.
Rumor has it that Kucoin and Binance will list Bellarium Network BEL token shortly after the launch. Great time to ape in
Just subscribed to Bellarium Network's channel. Looking forward to more updates on this project
Read the tokenomics, checked the site, joined the Bellarium presale. This is how you get ahead.
The whole AI narrative is exploding, but most tokens are just jumping on the trend. Bellarium Network is actually using AI for real DeFi tools — that’s why I’m buying now.
chaels voice is so american...
Max vs Charles  Ilia vs Arman
Max is a champ .
Literally the best interview. Max is a national treasure.
I feel like Max stands a much better chance at fighting Ilia @ 155
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
If Chael would just speak instead of yelling every single thing he's be a lot more bearable.
Crazy to think volk beat this guy 3 times
Max is just blessed and shares his blessing with us. Not a bad bone.
I think we can all agree that the real Baddest MF is Prime Tony Ferguson  The hardcores know
Bmf weights more now after this fight
Max is a Class Act❣️🙏💪🙌
that guy in the blue blazer does not belong there lmao, he's so out of pocket asking the wrong questions, the dude is tired, emotional, happy, and you're asking all the wrong corporate ass bullsht questions that 90% of real fans dont give a flying fk about, what a losuh lmao
Max! What a freaking beauty!!! He’s just fantastic!!!
Bro, a BMF ranking would be sick. Also, mad respect to Max/Dustin. Both class acts. Dustin, enjoy retirement and time with your family. Max, hope we get to see you back in that octogon soon. Stay healthy my guy. UFC needs guys like you!!!
Great fight between two great humans
What a true champion. A class act. A shame that one of them had to win because they are quite possibly the best role models in the sport. I wish him the best.
Both men are great human beings and amazing fighters
Yesah !!!! Blessah!!!    🙏 Big W from Max Boy !! Love you boy … just a true warrior from since you were young.Way ahead of your years.Glad for you and your Ohana and team .see you around Home side and Big Up Dustin P great career and bless the fam and your endeavors 🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
What is BMF? Why did this feel so scripted?
Let’s be honest. In those last 10 seconds and it hurts my heart to say this, but in those last 10 seconds, Dustin was fearful he was gonna go down so he grabbed Max
Max "At the end of the day" halloway 👑 BMF
Dang max calls for a rematch against Dustin? Yesssss
Looking for fight of the night was a step too far 😂😂😂😂
that leg ain't healthy lol
i believe max can get one back against topuria
At the end of the day it is what it is! We’ll see Saturday night
I like the idea of the BMF title changing weight classes as one fighter moves up and down
BMF title belt should be stand up only bout no grappling otherwise it's just pointless
Blessed forever if you believe the gospel of Jesus Christ..that he shed his blood for the sins of the world. Put your faith in the atoning power of the blood of Christ.
Dustin is something else for taking this fight.
Max vs Charles is a really fun fight! Let's go champ 💪🏻
Great fight, great sportsmanship.
Everyone in the back waving put ya hands down you look ridiculous 🤣
this is a great champ...  showed respect like a real man would!!!  great champ for sure!!
I’m from LA but was rooting hard for max. Hope he gets that ilia fight back
As a new orleanian max is my 🐕...I fks with max
W🎉
Max at 155 is nasty
If he doesn’t get topuria, paddy is the match to make..personally, I’d prefer that match be made above any other fight..the only fight I’d rather see is jones and aspinall
Boy Max's face looks like a steak and shake burger patty.  guy earned that check .
Max vs oliveira would go hard
hes had enough wars. Topuria should fight arman. Gaethe fights paddy. and he should get the winner between those victors. The topuria, fight he sustained a lot of damage. This fight, he was hurt bad in round 2. Brutal, hard fights one right after the next. This is probably his last run. Give him the best chance to do it.
Max and Dustin are  so cool man
Yoooo, him vs. Oliveira for the BMF belt would be a sick fight. This belt has a place. I'm excited to see what is next for Blessed. Porier had such an awesome career. They both set such an example for everyone else to keep on pushing and do the right thing. The champions are the best fighters in the world. This belt should be for those who are just badass fighters and who also set an example for people to follow. Because at the end of the day if you can't be the best fighter at your weight in the world, this could be just as much of an honor.
Max Holloway is a legend already
Do not underestimate the power of getting in early. If you are not in Bellarium Network BEL now, you are lagging behind.
“If you wanna figure it out you can find it out” -Max Holloway 2025
Their faces tell you who won this fight. I thought the UFC was judging based on damage? Max's pillow combos don't do anything, there's nothing behind them. Poirier's hits were hurting him and cutting him every single time.
They should have a BMF ranking.
Max is amazing, but he's a punching bag man, a real tough one.
BMF (Intercontinental Champion)
Should have gifted him the belt why not!!
Guy on the left in the background at 1:45 looks cooked xD
I’m a HUGE Dustin fan, but shoutout to Max! What a win and with class. So much humility and respect! 💪🏼🙌🏼
Respect for Max! This dude is a real one. Nothing but class.
One of the goats Forsure
I applauded you, Max Halloway, from my isolated home. You're an intelligent champion.
CLASS ACT
They should have got the fight of the night. Good fight.
Old … has been… bmf… pfft
I think if we’re going to do a BMF division then there should be no weight classes literally the baddest motherfucker just like the old UFC
Two legends . Max Holloways forever one of my favorite fighters . GOAT . Just sickens me to know sooner than later if he starts to lose these same fair weather garbage fans will be calling him washed up like they do with everyone else.
Charles vs Holloway Gaetchje vs Paddy
Would there be a BMF ranking for each weight class? Or 1 for all weight classes ranked together? It could be a lot.. and will need clear criteria. Unless just fans vote or something..? I think this is a very interesting idea. Could be quite a task too.
Keep the BMF a striker belt please UFC 🙏🏽
Either make a BMF for everyone weight class or make it open to all weight classes 🤔
Chael is a lame for not saying anything to Max’s face
Two Legends
Great fight, even better class.
Ilia vs Holloway 2?
Chael said ilia is bmf on the twitter thing but not to dudes face. What a lame.
It was rigged
Real BMF is Ilia lol
Why does Chael Sonnen shout all the time? He has a microphone FFS!
Such a rare class act Max is.
Congrats Max!!!
All of these fighters after being in the game so long are sounding like Nate Diaz.
Max vs Charles !!
follow for some content !
These guys are true mma legends staying in the sport as long as they are. Wish Khabib would come back and solidify his status if he can even do it. He got out wayyyyyyy too early.
At the end of the day
Mannn max is and will always be a legend ! S/O to dom for giving max that real fighter salute !
Max vs charles, run it back!
Both Max and Dustin are class acts. Love both fighters.
Max v hooker for the bmf 💪
Dustin just can't get get a win lol
The respect between these two fighters are like brothers fr . Both dogs n no quit . That’s why they respect each other .
🐐🐐
Ufc is wack. Boxing is better
They should also start doing catch weights for BMF. You see so much talk about how their should be certain weight classes added. For BMF you could have 2 fighters at 160lbs or whatever other weight they agree upon.
Bunch of weirdos in the crowd
Max will have no brain cells left in a matter of years
the need a BMF title for each divivsion
Hey Mr. Max Holloway you’re a class act. A warrior and ultimate entertainer inside the ring and a beautiful human being outside the ring.
Max,  GOD has made you a good man!
I think Max held back in the 1st
Both of them are class acts.I hated  to see Dustin lose but he lost to a stand up dude with a steel chin and cardio for days
Legend and dog ...
UFC Ranks Have no idea what there doing ... lol😂😅😊
Paddy kills him 😂
There shouldnt be a bmf ranking
Max Graphene Holloway
Max went into my top 5 when he let up on Dustin instead of finishing him.... he couldve finished him early and you see him stand up and stop throwing the rest of the round in the first. Watch it back and you'll see how great he is
crazy how these dudes can put their life on the line and then go on a talk show lol
Blessed Man Forever!
"if its a gimme belt why you barkin up my tree after it?" Max with wisdom for the haters
Max was on point last night
BLESSEDEXPRESS
85% sold out and flying under the radar — don’t wait till you’re priced out of Bellarium Network $BEL token.
As someone who believes in the power of crypto, Bellarium Network presale has caught my attention.
This is one-in-a-bull-run opportunity, you don´t wanna miss Bellarium Network´s token presale
Just jumped into the Bellarium Network token ICO. If you're serious about DeFi, this is your chance to get in early before the masses catch on.
The roadmap for Bellarium Network BEL token is super ambitious. If they can deliver on even half of it, we’re in for a massive ride. BEL to the moon?
Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the following year, Bellarium Network will outperform them both by far.
If I need to choose top 3 AI coins, my picks are FET, INJ and BEL (Bellarium Network), not in that particular order
Bellarium Network is one of the rare moonshot projects out there, must check!
Smart investors know the alt run is where fortunes are made. Bellarium Network ICO is the key to capitalizing on it!
I didn't like Dustin's performance at all. No attitude, no punches, slow. A retirement you'll never forget. Max always delivers.
I’m done waiting for influencers to validate my decisions. Bellarium Network looks solid, the presale makes sense, and the upside is real. That’s enough for me.
Look at what happened with LayerZero, with TAO, with Celestia. The real money came in before the hype. Bellarium Network $BEL is sitting in that exact same “before moment” right now.
BTC will go over 200k in the next year or two, that is approx 3x. Bellarium Network BEL token can do 100x if you get positioned well. Just check it out
I’ve been around since 2016 and rarely see a presale with this much depth. Bellarium Network doesn’t just ride the AI and DeFi wave—it’s actually building tools people will use. If you haven’t looked into it yet, do it before the listings hit.
Can’t stand Max
I like your picks, but these coins are already long in the market. I only invest into presales or private sales to get the best position. Bellarium Network $BEL token has one now, and now is the time to ape in, not one or more years later.
I’ve been around since 2016 and rarely see a presale with this much depth. Bellarium Network doesn’t just ride the AI and DeFi wave—it’s actually building tools people will use. If you haven’t looked into it yet, do it before the listings hit.
I’ve been in crypto since 2017. This Bellarium Network presale has the exact same early vibe as some of my biggest wins.
Bellarium Network is hitting all the right trends: AI, DeFi, payment systems, staking… and barely anyone’s talking about it yet.
Hooker vs Holloway should be the next fight for BMF. Dana’s gotta stop giving title shots off of losses.
The thing that caught my eye about Bellarium Network was how clean the tokenomics are and how underexposed it still is. We're always too late to these plays—this one is still flying under the radar for now.
All the top influencers are gonna talk about Bellarium Network eventually. They just don’t know it yet. I’m stacking now before they do.
Strong tokenomics combined with compliance and aware structure equals long-term institutional potential for Bellarium Network BEL.
Don’t wait for CEX listings — Bellarium Network looks like one of those rare presales with actual fundamentals.
You know what happens when utility tokens meet early momentum? Bellarium Network might just be that perfect storm.
Most people are still sleeping on Bellarium Network, but those who understand market narratives are already accumulating. When AI + DeFi becomes the top theme in the next run, BEL will be one of the tokens everyone wishes they grabbed early.
With BTC over $100K and ETF momentum building, Bellarium Network might be the smartest early play.
Timing is everything in crypto. And getting into a solid project before staking, listings, and influencer hype? That’s the Bellarium Network window right now.
Then a title shot.
Not financial advice, but Bellarium Network is the first presale I’ve actually FOMO’d into this year.
I don’t need Elon to tweet “Bellarium Network to the moon” for me to know this project has legs. But if he does… 🚀
Give him paddy the baddy
The next generation of ETF listings will look at AI-integrated tokens. Bellarium Network is early in that category.
The early metrics for Bellarium Network are looking great—growing community, increasing presale volume, and consistent communication from the team. That’s the formula that made early INJ and MATIC big winners.
It’s hard to find projects with strong fundamentals AND low market cap. Bellarium Network fits that mold perfectly. This is how you make 10x–50x plays without gambling on memes.
Just ran into Bellarium Network — low cap, AI + DeFi utility, presale still open. If you know, you know.
Crypto moves fast — by the time people catch on to Bellarium Network, it might already be up 100x.
Last cycle, I kept chasing hype coins and ignored quiet, well-structured projects. This time around, I’m doing the opposite. Bellarium Network isn’t loud, but it’s legit — and that’s where the real gains come from.
Just got into BEL. Took 90 minutes to research, and honestly I’m shocked more people aren’t talking about Bellarium Network already.
Too many people look for fast pumps. I’m looking for strong entries. Bellarium Network is the kind of presale I’m happy to sit on.
There are lots of flashy coins right now — but Bellarium Network has the actual framework to last. Still early, still affordable. I’m in.
While most tokens promise “the future of finance,” Bellarium Network is quietly executing one step at a time. Multi-chain wallet, AI lending, DeFi debit cards, and a payment system? This isn’t a meme coin—it’s a real ecosystem forming.
at the end of the day brotha we gona find out
People are always chasing influencers and hype plays. Meanwhile, early birds are loading up on Bellarium Network quietly. If you know how crypto cycles work, you know why that matters.
It's rare to find a presale with strong fundamentals and momentum. Bellarium Network seems to have both. The staking, AI features, and roadmap make me think this is a long-term winner.
Not gonna lie, Bellarium Network looks like it wants to go turbo vertical. Moon boots on
I remember sitting out during the Bittensor TAO presale thinking I’d wait until it launched. It ran 100x before I even noticed. Bellarium Network gives me those exact same early, underpriced, overlooked vibes.
Bellarium Network checks every box—utility, innovation, strong narratives, and a low entry point. It’s rare to get this kind of combination, and even rarer to catch it during a presale. The window won’t stay open long.
I ALWAYS have been a Max H. Fan👊😎👊 He’s a “BMF” For Sure.
Max is a good guy!  Respect!
AlwaysClass!
Max is so HUMBLE! We love it braddah! Cheeeehoooo 🤙🏼
Max is a warrior with respect gotta  love it.
Max has had a long historic carear .
Put Max on the White House card
Aye just remember Unko chael and dom had the diamond in this one 😏☝️
Couldn’t ask for a better way to go into retirement. Great fight for two of the best, not just fighters but great men.
Max should have moved up in weight a while back
Two for the Hall Of Fame
Them not getting fight of the night is crazy work Dana ducking dropped the ball
This really was the best case scenario. Holloway gets redemption, dustins still 2-1 against him, and dustin didnt have to risk getting worked by some up and comer for his retirement fight.
This guy is getting weaker by the minute. He has to consider retirement at some point
whatever brains this punching bag had left Ilia knocked loose and sent into outer orbit. Sounds like his IQ drops every time he lowers his jaw.
max is the man !
Why the vile tattoos brother
What a fantastic card through and through and the ending, wow. I know Dustin didn’t win but man it was an absolute war and a great send off for a legend like him.
BMF title means nothing because topuria beat him up.
You ain’t getting a title rematch after that performance. No highlight finish and you beat a 36 year old on a 1 fight losing skid.  You trashed ilia for beating volk who was knocked out and Charles 36 years old on one fight win streak
Max is a legend and all round good guy... You can't hate this man!
UFC being on espn sucks bigtime
Max "Blessed" Holloway , class act . Blessed Man Forever .
Bmf belt lol
One of my favorite fighters right there, bmf
Thank you legends for an amazing trilogy and a perfect send off... thanks UFC for truly respecting Dustin
K I'm not mad at you no mo for losing to TopOria
Good fight Wai’anae proud-imua 🌺
Its says alot when this is a 3rd match that Dustin won twice and no one complained about it! I didn't care who won, both guys are legendary fighters. Enjoy you retirement Dustin, we all appreciate you🙏❤️
A BMF ranking list would be insane lol all of the absolute killers of the UFC on one list
Both freaking warriors
Class act gentleman
I dont know if you guys saw this, but I actually think Dustin won tonight after the way Joanna was touching and looking at him.     🤭
The first and only one to defend the BMF belt.
We love ya both man. Yall have both inspired us in our own lives to do our best. And thank yall both for the fights.
Let’s do Olivera vs max holloway💯
chale for Prez 2032
We are going to miss Dustin but thank you for all the fun moments and for kicking McGregors ass
Max has serious cte.  Beats dustin finally, then calls him the 'bmf'.  But max got KTFO'd by ilia, and then says gaethje hits harder.
all the kids in the background have the same barber
Max is all class. Crazy that that wave of fighters are old we are on another wave of new fighters. Been here since the beginning and they had me going from Boxing to UFC in order to not miss the fights.
4:35 Max was like did I get punched in the face or did this guy?!? Chael also said yes 😂
I'm sure Dustin isn't real happy when he went out, but he is a class act if there ever was one. Max is crema of cream. not the biggest hitter or ground game but his counters, his strike combinaitons, his angles. fun to watch.
I wish they would call this belt something else bmf is so cringe
Max vs Charles or Paddy are the fights
Class Act!
These guys respect each other a little too much 😂
Max is always classy and always shows respect for his opponent, a true warrior. Huge fan of both of these guys.
He’s slurring.   Enough.   Sell insurance.
Both these guys are what the definition of a true champ is man. Sad DP lost but happy that Max didn’t if that makes sense. Beautiful fight
Max showed  Sportsman ship.  When 10 sec was left Poirier looked up, at that someone could have taken a cheap shot and hit him but max lightly to tell him where are you looking 😅
The blessed express baby
Bmf ranking is the dumbest thing I've heard of since powerslap imo Just turn it into a combat circus
Lol thats Ilia tuporias BMF BELT
Never cared for Max Halloway in general but the more I hear from the guy you cannot hate or dislike him. Not sure where the resentment was from. Idc who wins or loses I just like fighting and MMA in general. Well done for him tho and congrats on the win and retirement to the legend himself Dustin.
Side note, why do grown ass men act like children when a tv camera is around?
The guy on the left asked Max, "what did you say to, Max?.." Poor analyst if he can’t put respect on Max’s name!
Bros face tho
KYUUUUBBIIII!!!! lol nice 9 tails.
Its insane, I’d be showering!
Bmf should have no weight class
Blessed Man Forever
Max is a respectful fighter. Been watching him for yrs n love his style.
My two favorite fighters
Both these guys are class acts.  I wish them both the best, in all future endeavors, most of all with them and their families.
Fkn Max, unreal.
Damage needs to be rewarded higher. You put them side by side and ask any average person who got beat up worse they'll all say Max did. Then you're going to tell them wElL aKtUaLllyyyyy the guy spams a 4-5 piece combos where only 1 or 2 get through at most usually on a roll, then backs away till he can repeat it. I think he got lucky vs both justin and dustin. Justin got his nose broke and had to fight 20 minutes with an open mouth. Dustin fought way too safe because he was afraid of getting KO'd in his retirement fight after getting put on his ass in the first few minutes. You just have to press max and throw he can't fight off the back foot that's been known for years, Conor showed that like 12 or 13 years ago, Volk figured it out but he's so much smaller that he couldn't capitalize on it as well as others, Topuria figured it out halfway through the first round, Dustin just fought with too much weight on his shoulders, never seen Dustin so hesitant to fight and back up as much as he did, with the way he was fighting Max probably could have put him out in the 3rd round if he really wanted too.
As a massive fan of Max... i dont care who he gets next so long as it is NOT Illia!! Stay away from that man please!
Chael says theyve never had someone walk over to this interview after the fight but i couldve sworn ive seen that happen so many times
Ilia vs Arman, Gaethje vs Paddy, Holloway vs Oliveira. Only reason Max doesn't get the title shot is bc Ilia knocked him out very recently
The rumors about TRT Diamond hopefully didn’t give tumors to Mad Max Holloway
4:34 Lmao
This man now carries the torch for DP. GO GET THAT LW STRAP
Dustin won this fight....look at max's face. did him in...ufc didn't need to give him the win though he's retiring so let Max go on and continue his career ....both great guys.
Why old people is dancing again and again in ufc octagon 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Fight paddy if you win back to topuria
Max is a Pillow boxer, can't knock out someone after many attack on face, and no wresstling that is why  his fight usually goes to 3 or 5 rounds
Chaels voice is so annoying at this point .. literally just says tacky lines to try to make clips all the time… no surprise he hangs out with Colby
max is from waianae, hes not retiring
Max is one of my favorites the class he had throughout the whole thing and the love he had for Dustin shows what kind of man he is
Max is getting better and more versatile, this is what no one seems to know or see, He TKOS  illa 2nd round in a 155 rematch. Remember this
This guy wants the true bmf who knocked him out 😂
Blessed Man Forever!
But he didnt call ilia the BMF afyer Ilia whooped his ass 😂
Dustin and Max are the best!!! Hope we all appreciate we witnessed greatness
The fact they have to do interviews after getting punched in the head for 20 minutes is nuts😅
Max and Dustin both the BMF's of CLASS.
OMG! Holloway won look at him 🤷🏻‍♀️
OMG! Holloway won look at him 🤷🏻‍♀️
1:10 korean zombie 😊
Great career for Dustin 👏
Everyone should know that DP WANTED to walk away, doesn’t HAVE to.
YOU ABSOLUTELY DOOOO NEEED a BMF Ranking!!! Also different judging standards for those fights! that would be EPIC!!! Seperate all these POINT and run guys and Lay on top of you guys and Cant entertain and draw a crowd guys from the BMF guys!!!
I hate chael.  He oozes lies and dishonesty
Make NO MISTAKE, Max is Awesome, but Ilia knocked him the Fu*ck OUT. Anytime Max wants to risk his BMF belt against Topuria, then let the sparks fly, the only question is will Illia knock him out faster than he did the first time. THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN  ILLIA and everyone else in this division. Topuria is multiply levels above all of them, and everyone else, regardless of name or history will fall, some sooner than others, but no fighter can stand up to Illia Topuria. He is the TRUE BMF of the UFC.
The blessed is all around great fukn dude🙏
Pure legends!
I was hoping Max would put that BMF belt on Dustin after the fight.
Crazy to think that Max has been in the UFC since 2012, and he’s only 33.
He looks amazing for 155 but I still feel like he gets hit ALOT
Max is a Legend 👊🏾
Nothing but respect for you Max and Dustin
Listen Dustin didn’t give him the rematch to have Max redeem himself he picked him because he thought it was a safer fight for a win! Justin hits to hard and he doesn’t want to get KOed at home but that was the real fight he should’ve had for the rubber match
Halloway gaethjie white house book it
Max "at the end of the day" Holloway
Respect for Max letting Dustin have the spotlight and not wanting a post fight interview
Hear me out  The only Ilia fight to make is Paddy  Max vs Nate Diaz at 155 for the belt Nate created  If Nate wins, McGregor Diaz III @ the White House for the BMF. Winner fights the LHW champ
Dustin did have to fight you .. he’s not Conor where he can headline without a belt
Would love a Blessed vs Baddy fight
Charles would be dope next for Max and that would make sense or even Chandler.
What a great person.
Max is just a dog. He really is. Hate to see Poirier go out on an L but if Max is the guy to do that, I can’t be mad at it.
Illia is by far the bmf lol that’s his belt
Somebody please tell Sonnen to tone down the glasses. Good lord!
Utter class!
This shows how good actually Topuria is
I love max congratulations dude!!
Max max max... please DO NOT fight Ilia again. It wont go any different than the first fight.
He doesn't want to be called BMF bc ilia beat his ass😂
Max hating on olivera will never make sense to me. A healthy olivera waxes max 7 days a week and I love max
Idk if I agree with Dom saying it's hard to give a rematch to a guy that you've already beaten twice.
Both men are 100% class.
He has the firepower to drop Ilia at 155. Still, I think Ilia is too good, but man this future rematch sounds fantastic at lightweight!
Best interview of the night❤
Been watching Max my entire life crazy he’s just 33
Max versus paddy BOOK IT.
He’s only 33….?
Max is so humble talking about how Dustin gave him the fight, Max and Gaethje are the only fighters fitting for Dustin's last fight
How could Max and Dustin not get fight of the night?
I think max should fight volk for a 4th time for belt
This is how u win the trilogy after down 2-0 , imagine max waited till Poirier was 48 then finally beat him then started taunting and then burying him in the cage like Tito 😂😂😂
Holloway meant business "he took my debut, I'm gonna take his retirement"
I low-key been saying this I agree with Joe and Max, but make that BMF thing a real thing make it a ranking. It’s something that would give people something to fight for and also it’ll help me closer to that world title.
They just don’t make them like Max. One of a kind.
الله أكبر ❤ لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله ❤
"The guys ranking the UFC have no idea what they are doing" -Max Holloway 2025
Not only does Max break the BMF curse, he breaks free from being 0-3 in trilogys. He is currently 2-0 in lightweight in the past 2 years, give him his lightweight title shot
The only fight that makes sense if we talking BMF is Max vs Jorge Masvidal @ 170.
he must feel like Izzy felt, after finally getting the W over Perreira
Max’s brain is going to be mush in a few years.
He IS THE BMF
They’re is a saying I know that sick attracts sick, but I firmly believe class attracts class. I can’t lie I cried at the end but couldn’t think of a better last dance partner for Dustin. Go how can you not love fighting.
Could never hate either of these guys
Holloway forever my favorite fighter.  THE BLESSED THE BEST FOREVER!!!
Dustin was Max's first fight... Max was Dustin's last fight.
Sby fighter un any league to willing to take a punch take a special and bracve person hands down respect to all of them men and woman
I done told you
Such a gd dude.
🌺
Holloway vs Oliveira next  🇺🇸 vs🇧🇷
The last 10 seconds of the match gave me goosebumps when Dustin stood in middle of ring pointed down to max they dap up and went to town awsome
Some haters were saying Ilia beat washed Max😂😂😂  Ilia called him "bounce back". for a reason..Max deserves the title shot now...
That backdrop is god awful
He was #3 when you beat him max
MAX IS THE PEOPLES CHAMP
How do you not love Max!
As Max says, BMF “Blessed Man Forever”. Truth is that we as MMA fans are “blessed” to be able to watch this sport and witness these class acts in the Octagon. Great fight and best wishes to the Diamond Dustin Poirier for an awesome career.
Someone pass my man Max a shirt or something
Give him topuria
I’m new to mma but after hearing this guy talk he sounds Mexican rather than American.
Max is such a class act. Legend.
topuria vs max on this weight would be interesting
Maximus Holloway is a monster. Dominated Justin and slept him, dominated Dustin and almost finished him like 3 times.
As real as it gets
Diaz vs Holloway!
He actually has the best chance of beating ilia imo but still won’t happen
It was a good fight! Poirier doesn’t have anything to prove in the cage anymore. He is a legend just like Holloway and Justin Gaethe. It’s high time Dustin enjoyed his family and his family to enjoy him and his presence. UFC had been good to him but life is not just all about UFC. Life is beautiful!
UFC is now a causal fan fest. Let’s all this existing fighters fight among themselves while the true essence of MMA the real contenders having an actual chance of getting the belt Arman, Movsar and Brady will be kept on the shelves.
Max is way better and hits harder at 155
It was the 6th round.. Chael: Yes.
It's hard to get up for a fight for Dustin when you already beat him twice.  So I understand why he lost.... Compared to Max, where he wanted that win, he did not want to lose 3 straight to the same person.He had more motivation...  and another thing for Dustin win or lose this was his last fight... so winning wasn't gonna move him up in the standings for a belt.   And losing yeah, you don't want to go out like that, but you know it's your last fight winner or lose.
I hope Max gets one big money fight and cashes out the game. He's got such a great mind and personality that he can make money with, and you only get so many wars like this before your brain turns to mush
I know it's hard to justify, but to me Max is the GOAT. He represents all that is great about this sport, and has given us some of the all time great fighting monents. Looking forward to watching him fight again :)
I also wouldn't mind to see Max vs Nate Diaz for BMF but would want it at 155.
The problem with giving Max Ilia, is that the first fight wasn’t even close. It was as 1 sided a beat down as when Canada went to war with the USA and kicked their ass!
"If you want to figure it out,  we can find it out" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Max is standing on business  with that statement!!!! That's that BMF talk💪🏽
Dustin is a class act and future hall of famer
All Love Brothers ❤❤
I think Max deserve a lightweight title shot or atleast a title eliminater fight
MAX HOLLOWAY IS THE MAN!!!!!!!  MUCH RESPECT BRO!!! ✊️💪🫡💯👍
Max is always a class act, perfect opponent for someone equally classy in Dustin. Love em both!!!
the goon at the back is annoying af
YES LETS DO CHARLES VS MAX FOR BMF PLEASE 🙏
dustin was gonna get gaethjed if he didnt clinch in those final 5 seconds.Great fight
Dustin could have fought anyone; he could have left the ring with an easy win. No, he chose to fight Max Holloway, a fierce champion and unbelievable fighter, for his last fight. Dustin leaves the ring with class, dignity and total respect. And credit to Max for making that exact point about Dustin. Two phenomenal people.
Great fight👍🏼❤🥊
BMF for 10 seconds
The BMF!! The runner!!
I like how chael didn’t mention gaethje when for what’s next whether title rematch with ilia or #1 contender spot or rising star pimblett. Gaethje doesn’t deserve a title shot conversation unless he beat Arman, Charles, max or pimblett
'We gonna find out brother' Oliveira vs Max 🔥🔥
Is good, FairPlay and class, but an arrogant piece of s**t who cary in the same time BMF belt will match better. Masvidal and Diaz they really were the ones most qualified for this belt. Max is too much of a nice guy for this.
New legendary unlocked fighter has to be last 10 seconds Max Holloway haha
With Dustin's departure, I too am done with the UFC ✊
Max is a legend of the the sport
Max is the best BMF yet. The way he closes out these fights when he’s up 50-45 is gangster.
This BMF fight sucked, it was two dudes playing tummy sticks in the ring. Boring fight
Well done max. He’s gotta be top 5 all time.
Max vs illi at 155
Got pieced up by a 39 year old entering retirement brother.
Best is blessed
Illia is more powerful at 155 ...a machine
True class
Max vs Oliveria is a great next fight
The respect Max gives is Dustin awesome. He's really the only one that could've beat the diamond and even though the fight was so close i think Max really put it all together and deserved the win. What an amazing last fight for Dustin and great performance from both of them. Absolute legends.
Dustin is truly a guy who has come whirlwinds from when he fought Connor the first time-all those years ago.  The way he matured is so remarkable and never gave up.  He definitely got the last laugh on Connor.  Both these guy are great ambassador for the sport and human being in general.  Great guys!
what a gent. good fight from both fighters.
Mahalo Dustin! And you go Hawaiian!!
Love these guys.
Holloway had a beautiful soul. Forever in awe of this man
Props to Max. What's with all these losers in the back though? Lol. Truly a weird choice to do the interview in front of a bunch of dweebs.
Your sound in this post fight interview was spectacular. Raving fans behind you and the sound was like from a podcast. Whatever tech you are using is amazing.
Bro a dirty fighter but fun fight
Dude should’ve never went back down to 145 after bulking up
Now everyone becoming Max fans again. Really?
Go go rematch vs Topuria
Cheeeeeeeeee hunnnnnid! Such a legend of the Rock 🪨
at the end of the day, you are the BMF, Max!
"That's what BMFs do!"- Blessed 🙌
Bro, love you both Max and Dustin but, Ilia is the real BMF right now.
Max should be the UFC logo
Oh wow, I didn't know I was going to click on a video and see my Uncle.
MAX DOESN'T WANT ANY OF WHAT ILIA HAS, ILIA WOULD RAGDOG HIS AZZ, BUT MAX IS A BEAST FOR SURE, SO IS DUSTIN
MAX IS A PIT BULL
Max looked strong and fast, that was an awesome fight for him to put on that show.
Halloway is the true BMF champ he has served the title right!  I think the UFC should do more with this belt. To me it’s becoming a fan favorite belt.
Max accidentally dropped the hardest CTE quote of all time.   “If you wanna figure it out, we can find it out”
3:00 didn’t Charles tear his esophagus?
MUCH RESPECT MAX! From Louisiana Bless you brother
Crazy how a fighter gets knocked out 1 time and people say eh should retire specially when they are still in their prime like max.
Max is a class act and has always been , congratulations , to Max the Champ .
i think he should have fought gatje in my opnion, cuz he had already beat holloway twice, while him and justin were 1-1
Max is brilliant, I remember he made of diamond 😂😂😂😂
What a good fight
Max is usually very complementary of the guys he beats because it makes him appear better. Notice how he never said anything good about topuria
Holloway VS Arman or Paddy..winner gets a championship fight vs Ilia
About 6 seconds into that 10 second showdown - Dustin was "nah ur not knocking me out in front of my wife " and clinched.
Max made the BMF valuable ! The way he fights for that belt has elevated it in such a unique way . Any fighter who says that wouldnt want the BMF now is just salty . Doesnt meen your the best .... meens your baddest and most entertaining ❤
Max is right Justin didn't have to fight him but he still did because he wanted to go out a winner. It wasn't about giving Halloway a chance in what was a one-sided  trilogy. I'm so glad Max spoiled the party. Cherry pick gone wrong.
Max “At the End of the Day” Holloway
Ilias son
How are you bmf when you just got slept
.....that's wht bmf's do..... bro is just legend
Max was fast and laser focused
Max " The Retire Home" Holloway 😂. Man retired 2 people.
And they said dustin can beat ilia 😂
Whole different mindset then JJ!!! _ 0 _
What a humble man fair play to both men
Hmm max got dropped let’s not forget. I don’t think he’s gonna last against ILIA again
Lol Dustin clinched up instead of throwing in the last 10 seconds he’s soft.
This is the First time in Dustin's Career that He Lost 2 Fights in a Row!!!
Blessed Man Forever - BMF ❤
Dominic Never wants smoke with Holloway
Max now has double the argument paddy the clown could ever try to make for a title fight. Arman, Justin, or max if he could become available in time
Real vs real.
Oliver. Vs. Halloway. Sounds good
Respect is a warrior trait
Max “ at the end of the day “ Holloway
😊❤
He looked big at 155. The speed of the bloke too. 33 years old moving that quick. Legend
love both these fighters really the only time i would be happy either way it goes...
2 legends
2 or the best
Blessed Man Forever 🙏🏽
Max needs to stop fighting he’s been in so war fights gonna be brain dead by 45
What a legendary event. Max is a boss for giving the mic to Dustin then telling the crowd to get louder
Max couldve finished the fight twice, early, and he chose not to out of respect for Dustin. I ku mau mau, puhuluhulu, i ka lanwao!
Congrats, Max.
They can't have a BMF ranking or Uncle Chael will always be first!!!!!
Max and Dustin are simply the classiest fighters in the UFC!  Tough as nails, love the sport and camaraderie.
Max Halloway BMF - Blessed Man Forever!!
How crazy he could take all the attention and he decide to shift it to Duston retirement! That's the real BMF do!
Dude is 1st class! Without a doubt, he gave Dustin a respect pass in round one. DP, you a Legend!
I’m on Team Paddy Chael do t disrespect Max like that Paddy and Arman don’t deserve that fight stop with your click bait bulls hit.
Dustin won
Max is the f in man! Thanks Dustin! Both real class acts
Max rules
What this fight showed is it’s time for Dustin to retire.
Max is a straight out character from Far Cry  same vibe lol
That fight hurt me... I wanted both guys to win and didn't want to see either lose... was hoping for a majority draw. The judges definitely got it wrong, it was 2-2 going into the 5th and Max won the 5th, the scores should have been 48-47 Holloway. The MMA judging sucks.
I like Dustin, but I LOVE Max. He is perfect,
Max is my favorite fighter 😂
Hope Nate Diaz is getting royalties from the BMF idea. Surprised UFCs kept it this long.
Class Act utmost Respect! 👏🏿
Max vs Arman winner gets a title shot  Ilia vs Paddy will most likely happen  Max wants Charles because thats an easier fight for him and knows Charles will exchange punches with him.
DP welcomes Max to the UFC, DP got his belt off Max and Max retired DP. No better trilogy in the company imo. No bad blood just straight bad asses
@youtube took me about 40 tries but I got onto the video without watching an ad. Cop that you wanks
Not sure how an active BMF ranking will work but an All Time BMF ranking is needed for sure, which Max is currently #1.
I was rooting for dustin the win since it was his last fight and it was obviously in the south in Louisiana. But I ain't mad that Holloway won. Thank you Dustin.
Still did everything he could post fight to reassure everyone this was Dustin's night. Holloway is true fighter, constant respect.
Max is a BMF!! True Hawaian warrior
Max vs arman is next
I'm sorry, but Max can't call anyone the BMF, because he himself isn't even the BMF so long as Topuria still exists.
Max is a fn ganster
No Max.  You are the BMF.  In the last 10 seconds of two fights you were clearly winning you summoned both to the centre.  One dropped, and one grappled.  One stood tall.
Chael forgetting rule number 1 of wearing a suit. The shirt shouldn’t be darker than the jacket 😂
holly script
Max. He gave you an opportunity because he wanted that bmf title
So we actually found out saturday night
Max’s chin is the equivalent  of a 100k mileage car. I thought it was getting KO’ed tofay
with Max in the mix, lightweight became more interesting, put him vs tsarukyan or pimblet
Never really felt a retirement like this one before! Gonna be even sadder when its max time for this.😢
Hooker the only bmf worthy contender left
The best is blessed! He should rematch Ilia after he sleeps Arman
how did he win with a face like that 🤒
Best Fight was kevin and rodriguez
Max eye poke bmf
Ilya T. is the 155, 145 and BMF champion. He holds 3 belts!!
He should of fought paddy the Baddy as he likes max and would of been more action max held back no elbows etc while waste 😊
Way to go, you fought a great fight and congratulations on your victory.  I am a Dustin Poirier fan and always will be proud of him. Thank you both for all the respect and memories.
I have been a fan of dustin and max for a long time.     Both seem like great people.   Hope nothing but the best for the both of them.
Dominator is filling out lmao.....getting chunky 😮😂
Stop sleeping on my boy Max. I knew he would get this one
Just respect..I ve been watching these fights,all of these years..these guys they should keep fighting,they should make movies or something..they are true legends.and they will never dissappear..they entertain too much..they are so loyal,special,professional, and respectful people..they do this for respect not only for money..respect duatin,my favorite fighter.even better than Connor.. True fighter..never disrespectful..the new fighters are so cocky, so chulos..they have empty head..but not these ones...they are the baddest on the planet..Justin gaethje,max Holloway, islam ,Charles oliveira,but in this division...dustin is the best..every single match he did,is just insane.these people not copies like most fighters..they are originals,and never replaced by nobody..Peace!
I'm so thankful ive got to watch both these warriors careers      love them both and respect them alot
Max Holloway you make Hawaii proud every time you step into the octagon! Pure Class! Great evening of fights again! Thank you!!!!
Arman vs ilia , co main max vs paddy
Dustin looked alil bit off wasn't letting multiple punches go like usual mabe just being alil cautious but at the same time Max looked great a totally different fighter then there first 2 fights but all n all great fight. I think Max has just now finally peeked n is at his maximum level. Def gonna miss Dustin throwing them thangs Happy retirement Champ
sorry but charles beat a prime porier comfortably and charles hasnt gotten worse, would sub Max early imo
sorry but charles beat a prime porier comfortably and charles hasnt gotten worse, would sub Max early imo
Paddy the baddy fight makes THE MOST SENSE
Max is a class act. Big Dustin fan (I am from Louisiana so always pull for home team folks) and what a great way to end his career. Would have been awesome to see him win, but Max handled the entire thing with such class.
How can you not love Max, man. Dude is class through and through.
These two will fight again
The UFC is dead 💀
win or lose they're both CHAMPS!
Max has really filled out his frame at 155. His speed was there last time but Dustin was able to out power him in the second fight. Glad he was able to fix that aspect now.  Happy retirement 💎
Jimeny Christmas Holloways last ten seconds are getting ferocious
@ the DESK FROM THE WALK*0UT. BEST INTERVIEW @ THE DESK OF CHAMPIONS!
Max is all class man
If you hate Max, you gotta go see a doctor man
How could you think Dustin was gonna win how embarrassing to those guys 😂
Tuporia needs to fight #1 contender and not run
Crazy Max still looking this good after all these years, and is still relatively young
That Crowd booing Max Holloway was dumb and disrespectful, the guys a legend of the sport, comes to war every time, I get they love Dustin but show Max some respect and have some class.
Max should definitely NOT retire. he's still improving. He sits on his punches more, especially rips to the body much better. The man is blessed
Max is a all time
BMF?? He got KOed by Ilia
Max is on a redefining run rn
Max v Charles needs to happen in december
Seems like maxs legendary chin is slowly fading
Ilia topuria is the BMF Champion because he pointed to the center of the ring whne he fought Max and Max declinded
Max dominated Dustin. Dustin started clinch to survive last 10 secs.
Can we make this a thing?
lol ESPN couldn’t let this man shower and change before the interview? Lol these fighters do interviews and podcast before jumping in the shower
Finally put an end to diamond the gate keeper
Is that the face you get after “winning” a fight? Good luck with ilia my boy
Dustin Poirer was also juiced to the gills. Last fight, no fucks given. USADA dont care, UFC dont care... but they get a good fight. Max is the GOAT
Congrats on max the fn man holloway
Max is a awesome young man
All class
At the end of the day it is what it is
Max should have moved to 155lbs a couple years ago man, he's a different animal up there.
I had 20$ on Halloway but I wasn't overly confident. Both dudes are studs.
I would like to see Max KO Paddy tbh just so we can forever run that clip of him saying "scousers don't get knocked out", when we all know Masvidal proved that wasn't true against Darren Till and it was in England too 😂. Paddy wouldn't fight again after a knockout because Liverpool is known as "the city of self pity" 😂 so he would throw a tantrum and quit the sport lol
Paddy vs Max would be fun
Can't describe the respect I have for both of these men.....Gotta state the obvious. They're both legends.
I wish chael was not there DC should be there
They are two of the most humble fighters ever in the UFC. Other fighters should take notes.
Max vs charles is fun
Not a huge Fan…but Max is saving the ufc and the fight game! Mad respect
This is one of those fights where it's like - whoever wins I'm stoked, whoever loses I'm bummed. I'll always dig these dudes.
good too see dominick cruz back
BMF ranking is tough
Goes to show you how good ilia is. Rematch at 155
Worst fans, worst sport, worst owner.   Hey wanna live until you’re 50?   That’s what this garbage should be called.
My two favorite fighter honestly but you got power vs quantity in this fight.
Max vs Topturo for both belts
Is Max the nicest person in the world 🌎.  He makes me happy to love this violent sport
Grats max.
Might be my favorite fighter ever! That man is a class act all the way. Loved watching him fight and he always fights!! God bless Max Holloway!
Putting totally banged-up fighters behind the desk. Win or lose.. thats crazy
5-0 Max.
Dustin was never a champ for a reason. Overrated. Enjoy that loss my guy. And his sheep followers haha. 😂 lets give attention to who deserves it.
Holloway Vs Hooker let's go!!
I love both ❤max n Dustin  but I love ❤️ more max the bliss
chael sonnen looks like a wise guy with the outfit and glasses on hehe only thing is missing is a pinky ring lol
Max pointed down and poirer just covered up and clinched crazy
The blessed express
He just beat a fighter that retired . Let’s not get carried away. Paddy would destroy Max , he’d make it look easy.All respect to Max though.
Max is the REAL DEAL!
At 155 de beat  Gaethje and now Dustin. He should have moved up long ago. He fits right in.
Let’s go max ❤
From the cage to the interview panel🤣 lesgo
Dustin did not deserve a tribute video
This is the best of the UFC. Much love and respect to both fighters.
Hella classy
They both came at this fight crazy. Seeing these dudes go at it like that for the 3rd time in a row
Max vs Arman Justin vs Paddy Whoever wins better fights Ilia.
I want to see Max vs Arman.
Now u can realise how good topuria is
💪💪💪💪
Didn't realize how much damage Dustin inflicted until seeing his face up close like this.
At 6:05 the guy really knows his stuff 👏👏👏👏
Class
Max is a legend
The BMF tile is very gimmicky but every BMF fight has been entertaining. Keep it around !
Fantastic fight lads 👊 i hope life brings Dustin any dreams he has left in the future coz he's given us some dream fights over the years and I'll never forget them 👊 Thank-you so much Champ 👊🙏🇬🇧
Max you should’ve punched Chael in the face. He tweeted ilia is the BMF right after you just won.
2:15 absolute facts.
“That’s what BMFs do” it’s more than just being a fighter and the belt.. we will see a cohort like this again.. !
people that are hating dustin blow my mind
Class Act Holloway.I have Respect for him.what a great fight.👍💯🔥
We all love you max,  you are truly blessed, good man.
Max was on top of Dustin for a bit not knowing what to do😂
4:34 bruh you had one job get this spud off the panel
Angel monster 💪🙏🙏
Dont calle BMF a gimmick, proceeds to not put It on the line against Topuria 😂😂😂 what a joke
This was obviously the wrong fight for Dustin, how much can you be motivated for someone you beat twice already and it's your last fight ever, Wrong fight!!!...
Max please stay at 155
MAX'S PUNCH SPEED WAS GREATER IN THIS FIGHT. DUSTIN'S PUNCH HARDER BUT SLOWER. AND ALSO HE WAS JUST GOING FOR THE HEAD. WISH HE HAD KICKED, THROWN STRAIGHTER SHOTS FREQUENTLY. BUT BOTH FOUGHT WELL.
Does no one talk about Chael stealing the schmo's whole swag?
Chael makes this virtually unwatchable
Nate will always be the spark of thre UFC and MMA as a sport, Max is the perfect BMF
I think max lost the first cuz it was debut. Lost the second because he wasn’t ready for 155. He just cut less weight rather than move up proper. This one he has the time and fights behind him to show he is just better than DP.
👏👏👏👏
Max looked sharp
“He got weezy to put the belt around the winner”  Max is really giving the whole night to Dustin
Love Max. One of my all time fave. But can y'all please stop treating that BMF belt like it's a legit championship. Its a made up title. Not a legitimate world championship. 😅
No one wants to see tuporia vs max again
Y'all are both bmfs
Dustin took max 13 fight win streak & max took his retirement fight 💯
Max is a gimmick..😂😂😂you are not a BMF waiting the last 10 seconds...do it the first 10
Props to both fighters. Now it's time to retire this fake ass belt.
Max. A class act. What a fighter. A humble and allround respectful guy thats just plain nice. Thats how you get respect from other fighters and fans around the world. This WWE aggresive clownery makes them look silly and immature. They should just be them selves like Max and not act like a bunch of pricks. Max. The peoples Champ 💯👑💙👑
It took max 3 fights to figure out Dustins wierd blocking
2 legends. All respect.
My two literal favorite fighters! Glad Dustin is retiring on his own terms and I’m also happy that max continues to look like a beast at lightweight! Can’t wait to see what’s next for both guys, The Blessed One & Diamond ‼️
4:19 topuria is tight? whos joe? 😂
What a fighter Max is, and gives his time to talk and thank everyone..... Pity there was so many brain dead morons in the background waving like schoolkids at lunch time
Absolutely class act great man
THE BMF 🔥 🔥 🔥
Mac Holloway is the GOAT... Who else could give an interview like this right after a 5 round brawl and be as coherent and professional as he is.. Max Is in the Mt. Rushmore
Dustin originally deep inside he wants to add BMF belt in his career that's why he's fighting Max
Pure class 👏 Legendary fighter
The Puka Nacua of the UFC. The Max Holloway of the NFL. Same same.
The belt doesn’t make sense to me, cause only one weight class has it ? Shouldn’t other weight classes have the belt.
Maximus holloway thanks for the memories
Max will piece up Do Bronx. He may even finish him. Ilia vs Max would be interesting at 155 but Ilia may sleep Max even worse at 155.
this was the tightest fights in all of ufc history in my opinion. two BAD dudes. i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. hats off to both of them.
Max beats ilia at lw 👀
Gutted Dustin didn't get the win, but he couldn't have gone out to a better man. Well done Max. Diamonds are Forever.
Max’s hand speed the last 10 seconds was insane
he envy El Matador 😂😂
Dustin the man who ended Conor’s career.Listening to fighters showing respect is a breath of fresh air,true warriors
They should have a BMF belt in a different weight class every year.
Orbital is crushed
Just want to Say thanks Dustin! We are all here in Australia backing you in! We love max aswell but thank you for entertaining us down under!! Diamonds forever mate! YEE!
Great job Max! You are the people of Hawaiis and Wai’anae proud! Cheeehuuuu
2 hammahs…period!!  🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
3 great fights together. Two great champs
Real BMF is illia topuria
Today, Ilia's haters aren't saying anything about Max losing because he's coming off a knockout, right? Hahaha.
both of those guys are great people that is for sure
Sorry Gaethje, max just pushed you down the line.
Ironically booing Max was so fun. Who doesnt love Max!?!
The loser of the Ilia or Paddy fight should fight for the BMF or Charles fights Max and winner fights the winner of Paddy and Ilia. I love every opportunity
I hope Illia hasn’t cracked that chin. Max is lightning fast at 55 and those punches got some boom in a them.
Dustin had 10 seconds to go out on his shield and he punked out!! Grabbed max like he was 12 going in for a slow dance….
Tyrone
great gladiators / warriors
Dustin should coming back for Topuria.....He needs to fill the gap in 155
🔥🔥🔥
Max virtuoso performance
Max is honestly a 1 of 1. What an absolute savage!!
Holloway doesn't realise, there was no other choice for Poirier. He had the BMF that Dustin lost to Gaethje. It was an earned fight
Not sure how Chael can sit there after an interview like this and tweet that Ilia is the BMF. Not a chance. Max all the way!
Chael "most annoying voice ever" Sonnen
Blessed Man Forever!!!
Max is very respectable  to everyone  I hope he stays healthy and  stays the champ
Max should be calling ilia the bmf because that would be the truth!! Dustin wimps out the last ten seconds and he is bmf????
Let max fight ilia at lightweight.
Didn't ilia knock max out cold?
Just bring conor back to fight for the bmf. Love max. The best is blessed.
Weak fight
thank you dustin but the glazing is crazy
Khabib ran has to be one of the most coward moves in mma history
Jack Della Maddalena is the BMF champ
wish the best for both man, hopefully max can get one back against illia
BMF ranking is a dope idea
of course the real BMF is Chael Sonnen
Max was looking good in there but I still think Topuria will get him. He gets hit clean and you can’t risk getting hit clean by Topuria.
BMF rank would be cool
Max looks amazing at 155. The BMF belt started as a gimmick but honestly is developing pedigree really, idk what that pedigree is but it's something lol. The #1 contender I guess? Lol
Dustin will be missed! I’m happy that Max won but sad that Dustin lost! Diamond is forever!
The fans won tonight these two are some BMF
Max beats Oliveira, not bc Charles lost to Topuria but because at lightweight he’s 2-1 and reached another level of cardio, chin and his power. Will be a good fight max just has to survive his ground game which I reckon he can and then piece him up
Max went off last 10 seconds
Another fantastic win by Max Holloway, loved the fact that he let Dustin have the spotlight for his retirement, Max is a true class act. 💯
If he fights paddy then he would not knock him out cause Paddy is a scouser he wont get knocked out he will crack on threw anything
Just let him go and heal you will interview him later😢😢
Lame
Did the last guy call it the “BFF”?
If you saying dustin would have got knocked out if he didn’t block. Life is not what ifs. There is reality and there isn’t. Dustin stood in the  middle landed some shots, and didn’t get koed. Better than most fighters fighting Max “blessed” holloway. Ilia still clears the divison
Humble Hawaiian...
Max has to be the most likable guy in MMA currently now that the diamond has retired.
Max is a class act. 👊🏻
Bless Max Forever
If people hate Max then they're highly questionable lol
They gonna make paddy vs holloway for sure now for the number one contender fight. And arman or gaethje either one of them is getting a shot at MSG against topuria in december.
Ilia topuria real bmf
Bruddah Max will always be a legend. When the day comes and he can no longer continue in the game, his fighting spirit and making fights exciting while keeping it classy will never be forgotten.
Max Holloway v. Conor McGregor 2 makes sense now. Max will beat the brakes off Conor, avenge his loss, make easy money, go home happy!!!
The Blessed Express rolled thru the heart of Louisiana!
Love Max! He's the man....
Should have had fight of the night!
So now max has beat a zombie. A highlight. And a diamond. What’s next!?
Chael "Mr. Hyterical" Sonnen should be replaced in the panel by the newly-retired Dustin Poirier.
The fights that matter most Dustin usually falls short but such a warrior in and out of the octagon. Congrats to both these men.
This Carnt is all class, pure role model for all. Humble staunch and right amount of mongrel !! Shot Max True BMF.
Probably the next fight for max would be with charles
dustin lost two opportunities to become bmf and 3 opportunities to win the undisputed championships he doesnt deserve hall of fame
Chael sonnen has to be the most annoying person in all of ufc as soon as I hear his voice my speakers start crying lol
Legend Max!! I think they should rank the BMF just for fun
First time Bmf belt defended right?
Your favorite fighter's favorite fighter...i love that💪
That’s what BMFs do
Max loves fighting the risk of it. Hes different
I wanted Dustin to win cause it's his last fight,but man max is a class act. This is the first time I rooted against max anyway lol
I advise everyone to learn about Islam from the correct sources
Max should fight Paddy or Arman and if he wins get a well deserved rematch with Ilia!
Don't understand how Dustin won hin twice cause his style to throw 1 punch in 5 years and etc is so comfortable for Holloway.
With Poirier being my favorite all time fighter it sucks that he lost his last fight but with Holloway being the one to take the W, it makes it a lot less painful to accept.
So we wont talk about Dustin clinching at the end!
My favorite fighter, no debate. Love how he carries himself, and his talent is unquestionable.
The dude really said “what’d you say to max”. Sad….
Hawaiian hitman Max blessed Holloway 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Call illaa tuporia for bmf
The bmf is a gimmick
Max vs Illia next for the light heavyweight championship.
I just started training mma in my moms basement to beat maxs ass 🤣 jkjk
"BLESSED MAN FOREVER"
Matchmakers don't know what they're doing? Oh they know. They're doing what maga troll Dana tells them to do.
Max made the worst callout ever topuria is gonna steam roll him again Before the hater chime in he looks like a zombie after this fight 🤦‍♂️
Nobody leaves a Dustin fight without an ass whooping
I love both DP and Max. UD for Max is perfect. Dp is retired, so it is better for Max to have the win. Both legends
Respect both Poirier a legend and so is Max 🙏
well stated Sir Max for Sir Dustin to give you the trilogy; thank you dearly for your works and services Dustin The Diamond Poirier✌🏾🙏🏾🐜Bless
I figured max would win this one
Wow. Louisiana swamp trash picked a guy he beat twice for his final fight. How brave
ESPN, Max would be a great commentator, he is intelligent and respected.
Max would smoke oliveira.
Blessed Man Forever 🙏🏼
I hate Max was his retirement fight . I’m from Louisiana and Max is my favorite fighter . Dustin in my top 5 but I couldn’t root against Max . This would’ve been the only time I wouldn’t have been upset if Max would’ve lost tho. Thanks Diamond,enjoy ya rest
Whole credit to Max, he’s a legend, but the man has taken a lot of damage dude, I feel bad to see him banged up.
Dustin didnt wanted to become a highlight like justin
How did max win looking like that , they’ve got to rework the significant strike chart …
Dustin broke Max’s face.
If Topuria defeats him again, they will say that he has defeated another old fighter. This fight Will never happen again
omg finally this card is over. All this glazing each other is really annoying.
Way to silence that crowd Max 😊❤
We found out on Saturday night
Nice suit Chael
MAX THE FACTS 😊
Why do I really wanna see Max v hooker
THE MAN ❤
And the end of the day...
BMF belt should be an open weight class, otherwise you can't claim to be the BMF!
Max should have automatically lost the BMF belt when he refused to stand up on the center with topuria
Max vs. Arman Paddy vs. Gaethje Charles vs. Hooker
I remember being around 15 years old when I first watched Max and Dustin’s first fight. Throughout all these years to see these guys still throw down made me emotional today. How fast time flies. All the best to Dustin though I hate seeing all my favorite fighters retire, but I’m happy he went out on his own terms.
Max and Dustin are true warrior legends - unlike Conor the Clown and Jon the Duck
Max vs hooker for bmf belt
Max is awesome! Hard not to like the guy. He always brings it. Great fighter inside and outside the cage.
he looked so good at lw
Should of been 50-45 . Dustin won 30 seconds of rnd 2. Dustin quit in Max time. Had to grab for the neck in that final 10 seconds after eating 17 punches in 3 seconds
He should’ve got the finish or got Gillyd😑
I got an idea the bmf vs the champion for both belts
Max got his get back
I can’t imagine giving interviews after fighting 5 rounds lol crazyy
It is what is was and it was what it is bruhta
Max showed why he’s the DEFINITION of a BMF, but Dustin also left it all out there as usual. Diamonds are forever 💎
Atienovadei
Unc still thinking about Conor’s mcmeat
Imo max vs charles is the best fight to make
“That’s what BMFs do” 🗣️ -blessed
If all you did was tune into this and seen maxs fight you wouldn’t have guessed it was a 4-1 easy win for max
Mahalo for the fight, Max. Total banger. You and Dustin put up a great scrap. Thank you, Dustin, for the great battles.
Been watching this since November 12, 1993 never seen a classier fighter than Max.  He stood down after a win for a fellow fighter.  Who has ever done that?
BMF = Blessed Man Forever love you Max!
Max is forever a legend 👑
Dustin didn't really want those last 10 seconds in the phone booth. They slapped hands and had a gentleman's agreement to throw down those last 10 seconds, but Dustin clinched with him when it was too much.
Max Holloway 🎉
Let the guy go and breath for God's sake
Thank you, Max $$$$$😮😊
Max and Oliveria would be a great fight
If Max isn’t in your top 10 ever, you’re a certified hater
Max has looked so good at 155 with the gatchje and Dustin fight. Him vs Charles or paddy would be sick
Max clears Voll @ 55
Top shelf professional. Massive respect to Max! His retirement fight will ring just as special!
As a Hawaiian, max represents us so well
Max is an absolute savage. Great fight. Congrats on a true BMF performance Dustin
I used to like Chael, but his act is getting stale  Almost forgot-Strip Tom
Dustin made the dumbest decision ever! You beat a guy like Max Holloway twice and decide to fight him again for a third time just to give him a chance to beat you?😂 not very smart at all.
The real bmf champion!!
I love Max and stuff, but please can you stop this "Stand and bang" nonsense? It's a lot easier to "bang" a guys who you already 50-45ed and are almost knocked-out. It's not a good look man, especially after you declined to bang with Topuria at the beginning of the fight, why? He was "too much fresh" for you?
Fight seemed massively rigged to me. Along with the Holland fight. Lets not forget the whole start of this card we had like 5 favorites win in the first rd in a row. And then in these fights Holland and Poirier both get dropped by opponents they have no right even getting dropped by that easily and both Rodriguez and Holloway suddenly stop trying and put their hands down and get rocked themselves and the live betters are all slamming the odds and then suddenly neither of them can hurt each other and the fights go to decision. I aint buying this nonsense
Congratulations to holloway on the win and congratulations to dustin on a legendary career and well earned retirement 👏
Class through and through. This guy Max Holloway deserves more love ❤
He should never fight in featherweight division again. He looks amazing at 155 he might fight for title again.
ty
Max a greedy fighter I know he’s gonna try and go after Illia soon at light weight and lose again being greedy lol
I had DP winning rounds 3,4,5
Great fight by both.
He barely won against a dude who knew he was going to retire at 36.  Just think about that.  Love both guys but seriously, everyone just think about that.  Ain't no one retiring at 36 with that much money, and loses. Any other sport, or job, it's just a cirucs right now.
Max looking like Jerome tonight. Wanted both to win but it is what it is now.
BMF Blessed Man Forever
Dp ran that last 10 seconds lmfao. Great fight tho. All you MFers counted max out. Polls don't lie. But casuals do!
This card was 🔥. I'm glad these 2 LEGENDS went the distance.
Shine bright like a diamond 💎 💔☹️
At the end of the day i knew max would win
Please call out Ilia, we know the outcome what you did to him last time around. Remind them all that you are him.
My boy Max Holloway finally breaks the trilogy curse and gets it done against Dustin Poirier! Couldn’t be happier and seeing him in peak form at 155 is absolutely phenomenal.
W max but bro looks like he fought Rick Ross
Max looks better at 155 little more durable
Thanks for the trilogy fellas and Happy Retirement, Dustin. You’ve earned it, Champ.
How could you hate Max Blessed Holloway? Class act
Max vs Charles co main at MSG for BMF  Islam vs JDM for WW title main event at MSG in November
The blessed ❤ Get him his wife 😅
Great performance from Max, I thought Dustin’s gonna beat him again
Let’s go max!!
