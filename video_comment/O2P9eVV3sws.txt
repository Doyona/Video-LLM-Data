Why is it everything as green on it I don't understand
Politicians in Jamaica are dishonest.....Corrupt and should be Gathered up and put into Prison and made to do Restitution to the Poor People for 5 years. They should not be allowed to get back into ANY form of Government Point blank and Peroid
JAMAICA 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 PLS BE HONEST AND PEACEFULLY 😇🙏🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲

A PNP alone need the manifesto not jlp  because jlp do there best since in power!!
St Thomas, ever the forgotten parish
So why it's only in politics time the nwc can fix the problem???? See what I'm talking about??? And the fools rejoicing because they are so dham fool and accept just anything at all.
They will act like they are going to fix the water probably now because they want vote
What is the matter with these drivers 😢😢
It is unfair for residents not getting water and then JPS sending monthly bills for what they not getting
The JLP try to make the PNP put the manifesto before them to copped what they put out ole demands them 😮
Now that the pnp release their manifesto veneshia will go And write a copy for the jlp
It seems to me like the JLP looking some ideas before they put out their manifesto
No water in white hall phase 3 too
Images bad boy name " Teddy Bear"? Fish that..
Delray work very hard..
How can you have only one pump? That's just excuses that nwc uses. Another one is they're drilling wells. It's a shame and the citizens sit back and say or do nothing. I bet if they get water before the election,  when it's over there'll be no water. The people are the problem for not rebelling, not the government.  You can't do nothing and expect changes.
JLP doesn't need any manifesto the work is there for all to see
Big lies a who reads these things no sah
This mayor of Kingston need to fix up may pen cemetery it's a disgrace not even lights in the  office they have to be running electrical cards across Spain town road shame and you who called yourself a  mayor Jamaica gone to the dogs I remember growing up as a kid  in trench town it was well kept it was a pleasure going over there and pick pum and fruit whatever growing over there
Nothing new the same Old story of Jamaican living
WHY IS THE JLP PUSHING UP VENESHA PHILLIPS SO MUCH. IIS SHE THAT RELEVANT?
JLP is waiting on de PNP manifesto fe copy its ideas and plan.... poor Vanessa, Babsy has always been a laborite and she don't know when the manifesto a go ready and you a labourite for two months and know....KMT....if a laugh a pop up.
JLP using Vennesa Fillip
GANGS GIVING PROBLEMS FOR SO LONG BOTH PARTIES DID LITTLE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. SO HOW CAN WE BLAME THE U S ADVISORY WHEN WE HAVE  LAWS PROTECTING GANGS.
The J L P is all Lier
Jlp planing promises. They are waiting for the final result of the Don Andersons poll then they release their Promisfesto
Jlp have no plann so they want to thief pnp manifesto
PNP OPERATIVES within the JCF and Mainstream Media relying on Propaganda! IT MUST BACKFIRE!!
PNP should have waited a little longer before putting out they manifesto..
this mi a talk bout jamaica caught better time come like how god soon come . election monday and manifesto nuh drop yet ??????too much explaining nah look monday
Wow lord is this election water 💦 🙌🙌🙌
because the jlp says they are going to release their manifesto and Saturday they rush to release their manifesto
Election is in the air and the people of  St Thomas are  going to get water but when the vote makes and the election done the water a go done too so sad 😢
MR. AMOS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE MANIFESTO WOULD BE OUT..
NOBODY HAS TIME TO STUDY A SATURDAY MANIFESTO.
What I want to see in the manifesto of the major political parties is a commitment to completely disentangle the country from the last vestiges of colonialism and dismantle the Westminster system of government. It is high time Jamaica has a directly elected executive leader. However, I won't hold my breath.
The jlp is watching and waiting for the pnp to put out their manifestos  so that they can thief the pnp idea 😅😅😅
Pure accident caz these drivers nuh hav no experience smh...
The jlp always behind and they claim that they are the best
Thank for the update and the new
It wasn't the gunman dead the gunman run get away from the police
