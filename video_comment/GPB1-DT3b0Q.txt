Yep they all shit on US too often. now my NBA, NFL, MLB watching is 100% Charles Barkley interviews and shows he participates in like this. Thanks Chuck get these Mfas in line !!!
Chuck and danny could look to Shaq. Since that's all those 2 know. About how to treat people. And how to look to their parents, as far as how to treat people. Chuck and danny seem to forget. A Lot.
Charles Barkley is fucking hilarious, anyone who hates him has a sad life
Chuckles hasn't been so bold lately.
With today's NBA I'd much rather watch Inside the NBA than an actual game.
I'd Rather Watch Paint Dry. Than, look at democrat dan's takes.
Of course Democrat dan would have Fat Chuck on. Fat Chuck loves the view. Loves abc, cbs, nbc, msnbc, etc.... So Does Dannyboy.
the glasses lol
Call it outside the nba
Barkley is hilarious but damn those glasses on he's face 😂😂😂😂
“You really are the damn GOAT playing in these big ass bricks” 😂😂😂😂😂
Chuck, we would absolutely turn off an NBA game to watch you.
I'd rather see Chuck retire, instead of this mess that will be ESPN.
Perfect comment from Charles about playing back to backs…… I paid a lot to watch LeBron in December in Minnesota and he sat out.
They should call it Outside the NBA
ESPN will bring in Steven A Smith, cut air time and add more commercial and go straight to Van Pelt and sports center after the game…Will destroy Inside the NBA.
Magic and Bird saved the NBA….and Jordan elevated the league.
Are you unemployed right now 😂love Dan’s dry conversational approach (comedy unscheduled )😂😂
Chuck, people like me no longer care about watching the games and watch your show over the NBA.  You guys are entertaining. The NBA is not.
Please Espn DO NOT add some random woman to the cast or another ESPN talking head. It’s not broke so don’t try to fix it. We don’t need Chiney Ney trying to tell us “what it takes to play basketball in the NBA at the highest level”, we don’t need SAS screaming, and we don’t need need to hear anymore of perks grandmas sayings like If frogs had wings they wouldn’t bump their asses on the ground. Just leave the 3 OG’s alone!
Why is Dan so obsessed on why Jordan is doing this NBC deal?? Its obvious that Jordan and NBC was the NBA for almost all of the 90s, he's done with ownership and is probably doing a favor to some friends he had there. Its not that hard to figure out Dan.
Bro do those glasses get cable
Chuck, we will turn off the game to watch EJ, Shaq, Kenny, and you lol
I went to Lakers vs Suns game to see Barley play in person play.  I’m a huge fan of him. He was in jeans on the bench. Did not play.
The NBA hasn't even put out next year schedule why is Dan asking what Chuck's schedule is?? Nobody knows the schedule.
Filmed in tnt studio and aired on espn.. 😂😂😂
Chuck does not realize how many people WOULD tune into 4 dudes talking NBA 4:50 over some of the games if he was on it
I met Charles at 19 hole in Galloway nj wat a great guy my sister was bartending there and he was so cool even talked to my father who was a basketball coach and he even talked to him for 15 mins which means so much to me and my sister, i love Barkley ur the man! Peace and love Ray Thompson jr .
Dans show is the best
Big glases chuh rach Mead ovs
Chuck wants that $50M/year contract
So ESPN will be worth watching again, cool.
NBA on TNT and these crews are as important as all other main figures like magic bird MJ .... Without them I d have stopped watching NBA years ago
Those Glasses though 😅😂😂😂
I'm so confused still.. lol
My family were season ticket owners for the Portland Trailblazers in the 80s and 90s. We were contenders and teams rested their stars against us even back then. My parents gave me Bulls tickets for my birthday because they knew Jordan wouldn't play in Portland during the regular season after 1990. We gave up our ticket rights in 1994 because the product was becoming diluted. Now it's just awful.
Wemby will be the next transcendent NBA player.
Chuck is 62 and he’s not making $70 million per year. The comparison between his work schedule and NBA players’ isn’t a good one.
Something about Barkley interviews. I can watch it from beginning to end, easily. Add to that, Dan Patrick is the best to do it because he is enjoying the interviews as much as we are without talking too much
It’s going to take a cable subscription subscription to the NBA app and Amazon and I guess Peacock to catch all the games. It just seems like it’s gonna get very expensive and very complicated if you’d like to watch all the games??
Stop whining about load management. Load management = longer careers + less injuries. I'd rather have Steph sit out a couple games instead of getting injured and missing months
Is Charles gonna crap on the league that’s made him for half the interview again? Let’s see
Granny glasses
chuck, please get rid of those glasses 😂😅😂
Democrat dan Loves when Liberals say bad things about (Whites), (Conservatives), (Republicans). But, by God Don't Say Anything About The Other Side. Don't Say Fat Chuck is Racist. Don't Say Little Petey king is Biased. Don't accuse dan because his wife worked for The Clinton News Network. (cnn).
Dan is all over the place with this interview, not grasping that it is TBD.. Charles great as always, holding back getting frustrated with Dan...
Doesn’t want to get worked like a dog like Stephen A lmao
The 3 most important figures in NBA history aren't the 3 best players in NBA history. And Larry Bird has already dropped out of the top 10 ever according to stats. Nostalgia is the only argument left for keeping him on that list. He already said as much, himself, a long time ago.
Dan Patrick lowkey trying to defend load mgmt 🤦🏽‍♂️
Corporate America screwed up a great show
Zazlav fucked up. Then he has the guts to sit courtside at MSG for East Finals. He's a dumbass
Dan never fails to bring up the great white hope Larry Bird 😅 He was that dude though, undeniable.
Its 2025,Charles Barkley is still funny behind the microphone.
Love Charles he tells it like it is. No BS
Hello, Humans You may not get another chance in real life, so give 110% everytime.  TERRANCE OUT
They should do a work vlog so we can learn about other co-workers and build stories around the things they do while on set. The documentary they did after Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals was a great starting point!
Doesn't Chuck realise that people would rather tune into Inside NBA without highlights during the game, rather than watch the actual NBA game? Majority of people tuned into Inside NBA because of 4 dudes talking about random things, not because they were showing post game highlights. Chuck himself was blasting majority of the games they were covering anyways.
Best reason to watch the nba is the tnt crew not the game.
Basketball Players are underpaid.. They bring in a lot of money for the owners..  You know who is overpaid, Wall Street, Big Corporations, etc...
People will turn off a game to watch you guys! Especially during the regular season.
Love these. Dan, maybe dial the laughing at every word back a tad though. Btw, my favorite hoop shoes of all time are the Barkley  AIR CB 34 Godzilla.
Dam disney  fookin it up
they suck jordan dry any chance they get
Barkley said he was gonna retire from the NBA in 94, he played until 2000. He's gonna stay until he don't love the money no more.
lmao charles dgaf . but espn wont say anything because they NEED HIM
MJ is just gonna talk about how the players aren't him.
I hear you Chuck. This is what happens when you already have a good thing and mess with it. Money messes up stuff.
9:00 load management will forever be BS and what Chuck always tell about it is so damn true
Dan: are you unemployed now? ( key word for white for are you going broke)  😂😂😂
All that money and still those glasses
To think about it, TNT knew Barkley is  committed to retire  this time around and didnt bother to get the NBA deal. Barkley is Inside the NBA MVP. Without him, it's just like any other show
Dr. Jay
Thank you for the clarity! Love inside the NBA!!!!
9:51 damn, rookie numbers
probably time to go. BB is not a game worth watching most nights. Usually 20 pt spread by half
Load management is a front-office issue. If it comes down to paying $40 million a year for a player who load manages 30 games a year vs. paying $40 million a year for that same player to go down by the end of December, they're going to choose the former over the latter.
Chuck has 2 55 inch TV screens on his face 😂😂😂 His nose HAS to be strong AF 😂😂😂😂
Could this be a start to rekindling Jordan and Barkley's friendship?
NBA got more skill and athletic
It sucks I don’t like espn. TNT had a good thing. It sucks TNT doesn’t cover the nba finals. NBA TNT more real and espn does it for ratings
It's a shame the broadcasters at ESPN can go on but yet TNT has to come to an end. ESPN is horrible. God-awful. Their best bet is to get everybody that was on TNT on ESPN and get rid of the dead weight they have now.
I love Charles, I'm just disappointed Dan didn't talk about Chuck GPT because I'd buy one.
Dan had the perfect retort to load management
Chuck be the real Goat
Dan's an idiot. Yes, Charles got paid 20 million a year and work two days a week, but never was he EVER off. He showed up everyday. Dan, you're too old. Get off
Dan is so lost. Trashhhh
Peckerwood skunk danny boy
Dan asking such trash questions HOW is this guy even watched? Phucking pure trash
He asked about Bird Charles and he talks mostly about Michael. Smh!
Barkley is 100% right, paying double what TNT was paying for the NBA is not going to compute. I predict Discovery Warner TNT will be able to buy the NBA rights off of one of the networks in a few years for a significant discount.
10:30 Dan being a boomer asshole and Barkely freezing in response lmao
Wait they not going to have highlights?
Charles don't seem to like the ESPN bs😂
Charles is smart. The show is him and Shaq ... why lock into a 5 year deal?
Correction! They all owe Michael’s mother
1:07 "They aint gonna work me like a dog and not pay me"   The moment they make him go on ESPN deportes and say "muy bien" and "gracias" hes OUTTA there 🤣
Barkley is 10 years older than me  and I will never concede that the Holy Trinity of the NBA is/was and always will be Magic/Michael/Larry.
God bless charles
His glasses should be bigger.
ESPN better not touch a HAIR on that show!...and keep BLOWHARD smith away from that set....
Chucks glasses look like they had to be installed, good lord! 😂🤓
Barkley's the one guy who constantly trolls his employers
I love Chuck. Wish all the best.
I'd much rather watch those 4 guys talk than any nba game.
Jordan gonna be 10x anyones wages with NBC
I love Barkley, but am I the only one who notices he’s hammered
Got love ole Charles - shitting on his employer.  Showing all of us how it's done. LMAO...
4:46 On any given night, I’d much rather watch “these 4 dudes siting around talking about nothing” than the NBA game.
Every single time Dan has him on now he grills Chuck about money and where he's working/when. I don't get it, Chuck was my favorite guest but now Dan seems to be wearing on him.
Mildly annoying for someone who cracks wise and analyzes basketball games to complain about being overworked
Why is a Chuck wearing windshields
7:18   Jordan will do a segment.  And he is doing it so the 10 year olds have an understanding of who he is.  Jordan Brand.
Please no steven a smith or perk on thier show
Cmon man
14:28: I'm pretty sure people were wearing shoes to weddings long before Michael Jordan was even born.
The Barkley's were heavy shoes from what I remember. Jordan's aren't heavy.
Charles Barkley is a real gem. You may not agree with him all the time but can't help but like him.
Man, I love Chuck. He might not make sense sometimes but still love him.
Chucks a Legend. Those glasses though 😂
Wth you talking about Dan? Chuck played evey game he could and earned his stripes! You the overpaid media man! 😂
barkley is the truth
This is why we love Barkley, he’s honest, speak his mind, no BS and straight to the point and hilarious. Barkley absolutely right about Air Jordan being heavy and it doesn’t matter what’s the goat conversation people want to have, Jordan is the goat, no NBA player had ever done what Jordan did in term of basketball competitive, championship and financial and influence the game of basketball.
4:46 🙋🏼‍♂️ me
17:52 - I never liked Jordan’s for that exact reason, but I’ve never heard a pro say that out loud. Glad those guys had similar thoughts.
chuck is so funny.  go philiy.
4:40 Charles is underestimating the fanbase. As i've grown older, i actually like the show more than i like actual basketball. and it's not even a stretch to say that one of the biggest reasons i even follow basketball anymore is because of the show.  so i would definitely be watching their non-basketball tnt show over actual games! someone get this message out there to Chuck, Ernie, Kenny and Shaq! lol
Cool glasses
They will give him more money to work longer.
Charles, please don’t leave in 2 years!
If the show is broadcasted on ESPN why can't they show NBA highlights?
ESPN will ruin it with their Hollywood BS.
Is shawshanking someone graping them?
So funny reading all these comments that CB always soesks his mind , except when he had to walk back saying he wouid punch anyone in the face that wore a DJT mugshot Tshirt - once 1000s of brothers posted pics of them wearing those exact Tshirts CN had to backtrack & JFC can DP interrupt anymore? Also , their no way in hell ESPN will not add some female AA dei quota hires ro the show or implement SAS to be part of the show - CB is usually wrong in his NBA predictions bcuz he DGAF & doesn't watch the games, Ernie constantly quizzes him on whats the name of a player pic shown & CB ALWAYS doesnt know
I’m gonna say this one time and one time only TNT would’ve never made it without Charles Barkley. He is the best he tells it like it is you might not like it but you better learn to love it. He’s the greatest. He’s one of my heroes.
Honestly based off Chuck's description, they should have just ended ITNBA. You can never recreate greatness
I love Charles, but those Sally Jesse Raphael glasses got to go😂
I literally only watch inside the nba, the games are not nearly as good as their show
Hey Dan, lmk when Chuck comes on your show and I’ll watch all of em lol
I love his criticisms. Because he knows what we as fans don’t want
Im curious which Jordans Barkley wore.😂
What's with these ladies glasses that all these men are wearing now?
Charles gonna find out hard way when ESPN makes him talk about woke subjects instead of basketball.
15:19 "announced he had AIDs" he doesnt have aids chuck, read a book
I really like when this guy talk. He is a real dude. I like when he call Shaquille and Kenny foul 😂
I definitely don’t think Barkley is into the ESPN thing at all
dude repeats himself 24/7
we'll start a riot if ESPN try to change or censor Inside the NBA
Jordan really played 18 rounds of golf, smoked a shit ton of cigars, drank a lot, wore heavy-as$ shoes, and still dominated the 80s and 90s
Two legends of the game
Charles Barkley is a national treasure never afraid to speak the truth .. i hope he never retires from tv
ESPN sucks!
Bird is the second best player ever. And no steroids
NBA, wnba, all shit
Dr J had commercials and he did have Converse
Inside the NBA + ESPN will be a complete 🚆wreck
I think Chuck was talking about the 12s being heavy. But he also wore the 14s.
Way to call Chuck out making over $20mill a year and only wants to work 2 days a week but calling out players not playing every game 🤦🏾‍♂️
Once barkleys done, espn gonna axe everyone. Espn just accommodating the stupidity because of Barkley
I love that Chuck hasn't even worked a day at ESPN yet and is already threatening to leave if he's worked to hard 😂
ESPN seems so corporate. While Inside the NBA is for the working family household.
I love Sir Charels for his total honesty.  Refreshing contrast to most of the garbage ESPN puts out these days.
Barkley been threatening retirement for 10yrs
Chuck will be on ... Get Up ... First Take ... NBA Today ... SportsCenter ... and anything else they can think of ... but the bad part is that Stephen A. and other ESPN people will appear on Inside the NBA !
Charles is a national treasure
Chuch started the interview like he just got off a shift wroking security
Never met him...don't know him....but he seems like a genuine dude.  Weird to see him wearing glasses.
One of my 5 favorite players and a fellow #alabamaboy. I love Charles.  Amen, Charles. Mike is the best ever, and Larry and Magic top 5 ALL-TIME as well.   Maybe 3% of today's players will be mentioned among the best ever. ALL players today are more than those 20 or 30 years is athletic. They're more athletic today. That's ALL.
Larry Bird Top 5 of all time.
Chuck I am definitely someone who will turn from the game today to watch you guys! I already do😂
I would to work 2 days a week and make 20 millions…I’ll bring in the doughnuts
Barkley trying to win Mike back and Dan says I would never let Michael go
Stephen a sharpe n shaq n chuck on espn
Love sir Charles!! 🫡
Espn inside nba vs nbc jordan
TNT can't even show the highlights. Man, they put this on themselves. TNT gave themselves a self-inflicted wound. 🤦‍♂️
no freaking way Chuck is going to last at the Woke Race baiting ESPN Network.
"They not gonna work me like a dog and not pay me. They gonna work me on ESPN 1 2 3, ESPN NEWS, ESPN U" -- Charles Wade Barkley
ESPN is going to ruin Inside the NBA. They should've signed with Amazon.
TNT should be covering the finals. Weird that Chuck and crew aren’t
Espn is gonna ruin the show just to make theres look better and go over.
ESPN will screw this up
The mothership is going to ruin the show…SAS well be hosting the show  before to long
I'm not a big basketball fan but Charles is the best
Sounds like espn gonna ruin inside the nba god damnn
i wouldnt mind if the guys are covering other sports tbh. basketball has got so boring i only watch it beacuse of these guys and only highlights
hey news break Chuck,,, yall are more interesting than 90% of all basketball games
Barkley not doing back to backs has been earned. That era valued the fans. I never worried about MJ or the others not playing on Sunday afternoons.
Tell me dude dont look like a ninja turtle
I can listen to Charles all day
Is Charles head getting smaller or are is glasses getting bigger😮
🎉
ESPN IS TO CORPARATE, I HOPE IT WORKS 👎🏾😏🤣🤮🐂💩😱😤😠😀😳🤬😡🤡
Charles is out of his mind. His CB 94s were rhe heaviest sneakers on earth. Wore them in HS and had to buy new sneakers after wearing them on the court once for practice. Cement bricks
Surely Chuck can find a pair of specs that fit him properly lol
Clowns who come to the internet to roast other individuals have no life at all
That was friggin awesome.
Charles “ But like I say” Barkley
100 percent agree with back to backs, the younger generation will give up on NBA
I like Barkley, and he found a great schtick for himself as the outsider.  Saying controversial things doesn’t make you more honest or forthcoming BTW.
Glad Dan had balls for a change and said to Charles about working. Ive thought that for awhile.
Charles looks like Mr. Magoo. 😂😂😂
Do an Inside the NBA show with old-time basketball highlights- 60s to 2000s.
Chuck should do NHL, I'd watch that😂
Barkley shoes are not light either. CB94’s are bricks
manning cast with the inside crew would work
Damn Chuck those glasses be needing some wipers if you're caught outside in the rain. They get dirty you'll be needing a window cleaning company to come squeegee them.
His take on load management was spot on. I dont know why people spend money on the NBA.
Their show was on for like 30 years. It’s not gonna be the same. They had a great run. Just call it a day.
If it’s Charles Barkley… I click
Larry will never be out of the top 10, he isn't even out of the top 5....  That is a ridiculous question.  Love Charles keeping it real and recognizing Magic and Larry as the most important players in the history of the sport.
Can anyone be too honest? 😂😂😂 #stupidshi…
boom
Charles is a star 🎉  he is 62 years of age now -  wrapping up at almost 65 years old ...  Inside the NBA is classic - but losing the rights to NBA will change the show for sure 😊
Always love Charles on and off the court, such honesty.
Dan Patrick asking a guest about Larry Bird. Shocking.
They all was scared ,thankful for the money he made them  and was friends wit Michael Jordan.  But it ahows why they loyally praise him. They didnt hate each other like they say and was a mans league. But jordan was getting thrown around til the refs gave him evry call to a little as breathing un his air space. So all the players who say it was tough was scary cats 🐈 🐈
I hope NBC bring back the old music too.
I grew up watching TBS Atlanta and WGN Chicago. Dominique Wilkins and Michael Jordan. Everynight. TNT has been fantastic.
Sounds like the ESPN thing will be a cluster you know what. If they can't get the pilot right and no highlights available then it may be short lived
I hope Stephan A Smith and K Perkins  won't be allowed anywhere near Inside the NBA. ESPN studio shows are unwatchable.
4:40 this is where Chuck is wrong. EVERYONE will turn off the game to watch them talk instead. I certainly will every single time theyre on. I basically do that anyways, for years I have already been watching the studio show only and doing other things during the sorry excuse for a "game" that happens during the regular season. If theyre talking during the game ill just mute ESPN and listen to them talk about whats happening or whatever it is. With the obvious exception of Mike Breen as well as Tim Legler and formerly Hubie Brown, ESPNs announcers are TOTAL GARBAGE now, they fired all the other good ones. And dont even get me started on that absolute joke of a studio show.............................  They arent going against the game, the game is going against THEM. If they arent doing their thing, the NBA dies because the regular season product on the court isnt even half as good enough to make up for it
Barkley gets it! The real deal! ❤️❤️❤️
I’d rather watch the Inside the NBA guys talk about nothing than watch an NBA game televised on ESPN
Heavy Jordan’s? Barkley wore the 14’s, literally the lightest pair of j’s
Hopefully ESPN won’t put a female or SAS on the show
Not relevant
Sir Charles,  You have been so great to watch over the years.  You make people laugh and the NBA on  TNT show is the absolute best.  I hope ESPN doesn't screw it up.
Harry caray glasses 😂
Love it when Dan says "mother ship". He is so cool
Chuck is always a great interview
That new show won't last
This is confusing
4:46 yah they will.  The TNT studio discussion is better than the games.......but having no highlights is a huge loss.
If anything will make me stop and watch, it's Charles Barkley talking to Dan Patrick.
Barkley oughta know that "the powers that be", aka the rich dude's running ESPN, aren't afraid to screw over an employee... should've gotten that work schedule spelled out very specifically. Chuck should be alright tho bcuz McAfee has already taught them dude's a couple of lessons
Would love to see Chuck and Jordan reunite one day and hash our their "beef"...
Somewhere a grandma can’t see shit
How did Kobe transcend the sport? Lebron, Mike, and Shaq were different. Even Steph is different. There was nothing about Kobe that was different. He was an imitator—facts over feelings.
I’d bet that their show will draw higher ratings than the actual NBA games.
Dan be having some great guests on his show, but Barkley and Mad Dog are by far the best 2 in my opinion. They're the only 2 guests that I would replay the appearance.
This was a rough Dan. Not knowing Charles schedule, asking how much MJ would get paid? There’s a max and he’d be there it’s simple. #shawshank
I like Dan, but the goofy laughter in this interview and comparing Barkley inside the NBA career to the point Charles is trying to make with the current day. Players was awful.  Stay on topic please , the only reason I watched this is because OF Charles Barkley- He’s a great interview. Dan needs to listen more instead of interjecting his opinion/sarcasm…
TNT still trying to milk every ounce out of the show it would seem...
You should’ve seen the big kool-aid smile on my face when I saw this video in my recommended.
The shawshank line is emmy worthy
You know I never cared for Barkley on TV after his hoops career. A lot of stumblin and fumblin and talk that didn't add up. However you have to love his open door to talk about things that 95% of people on regular tv would never talk about. Fans watch him because you never know what he's going to say next.
Thats odd. I could have sworn they got rights to highlights. House of Highlights is owned by TNT.
Hes not joking about them Air Jordan 1s. They are heavy!
Shaq never should have stepped all over Ernies farewell with the stupid mic drop. Cant understand anything he says yet cant seem to stfu
According to news reports, TNT has the right to use NBA highlights and develop TV shows around them so why is CB saying they don´t?
Remember when Chuck said ESPN “ain’t gon work me like a dog and not pay me!” 😂
Woke ass ESPN is garbage
Legend
Leave it to Chuck to muddle everything even more with the "transition" of TNT to ESPN, which no one seems to be fully understand or able to explain clearly.  I must say that Chuck has been one of the luckiest men alive in terms of career--after playing 16 years (unclear how hard he worked back then, but at least he played hard on the court), he's had an even longer and far cushier career in broadcasting in which he doesn't appear to do any prep, just being himself on the air.  Even the "prep" by actual hosts really consists of watching videos and attending meeting with others who come up with the most ideas on what they want to push on the program, and then reading off of teleprompters if they have that, or just go into BS mode.  Not a bad deal any which way.  Chuck's GRANDMA glasses make me laugh though.
Those glasses……. Chuck looks like a seal peering through a block of ice
😂😂 I'm still  confused on why they keep saying it's the last show, and what channel they will be on.
I thought Charles was going to retire.
The players r not inducting load management Stop it !!!
Charles is the real deal. He speaks his mind. No bullshit.
love the Lou Holtz Razorback figure. my father and I each have the same one!
DP loves Barkley….he’s like an African American but really a Caucasian male. 😂
Barkley yelling at cloud over load management. Stop it with the lazy take. Have less games.
The jealousy oozes off Danny boy
It is an insult to the fans and shows how soft they’re becoming
So from what Charles is saying, inside the NBA will be on ESPN / ABC for only 1/3 or half of the time, so basically the show will be on ESPN/ABC on selected nights during the regular season and playoffs. And them doing a separate show on TNT is something I have heard they was planning on doing for months.
So funny they show me dental implants when my 28 teeth are beautiful 😎
No one can answer a question 7 different ways quite like Chuck
Charles is so great!
Just find out what Justin Smollett is up to and let Barkley go.
Charles is the best.  Never disappoints.  Except when the show is in Phoenix or Vegas and he's nowhere to be found.
Remember TNT Sports is sub-licensing this to ESPN. More than likely the four gentlemen will not be on ESPN all the time.
Barkley > Burke
Why does the round mound of rebound have ski goggles on?
TNT is the only one keeping basketball alive  once you’re gone nobody will watch it. The funny thing is the delusional theory that espn  can keep going on after you’re gone is laughable
Queen James needs his "Load Management" so he can be flexible enough to FLOP
THE GREATEST BEST NON BIG CENTER POWER FORWARDS PLAYERS EVER IN THE NBA IS. MJ, KOBE, LEBRON, MAGIC, CURRY, BIRD THAT'S THE ORDER THEM 6🐐 GOATS TRANSFORMED SAVED POPULARIZED CHANGED THE NBA LANDSCAPE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WON GREATEST GURDS, SMALL FORWARDS.   THEN U GOT THE SAME FOR CENTERS POWER FORWARDS WILT CHAMBERLAIN, KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR, BILL RUSSELL, TIM DUNCAN, SHAQ, HAKEEM OLAJUWAN, JOKIC, GIANNIS TOP 14 🐐 GOATS  THEN U GOT THE TOP 15-30 NO ORDER JUST NAMES LEGENDS. DR J, KARL MALONE, KD, DIRK, GARNETT, CHARLES BARKLEY, JERRY WEST, OSCAR ROBERTSON, ELGIN BAYLOR, DAVID ROBINSON, D WADE, ISIAH THOMAS, KAWHI LEONARD, SCOTTIE PIPPEN, A.I JAMES HARDEN THAT I'VE SEEN.
TNT just licensing Inside the NBA to ESPN, sounds to me like it'll be the same show on ESPN. TNT just wants to make some money off the guys with that other BS show.
Nearly 8 minutes before a random “to be honest with you.” Cmon, Chuckster.
I don't understand why they don't just put more effort/production into The Steam Room.  They're not tethered to the NBA, they can have a million different guests and do the same silly segments they've always done in-between actual basketball coverage.  And because it's limited viewing it would be in higher demand.  I mean they could do game show format one week, remote location, open courts with Jalen Rose and Chris Webber, like all of that still seems like an option for them.
I'd way rather watch those 4 crack jokes and talk shit than most NBA games
Larry bird top 5 all-time
Love the respect Charles has for Kobe @7:31
I love chuck but wtf he talkin about Jordan’s being heavy, chucks nikes were the heaviest
Dan Patrick asking the same question over and over.
Rather C those 4 guys than a regular NBA game!!!
We been listening to inside the nba talk about nothing for years. Yes we will watch you over a game
So Inside the NBA will be licensed to ESPN, which we already knew, but sounds like TNT is trying to do a separate show with the guys as well, but without any highlights.
Chuck’s librarian glasses with lenses that could melt ants
Love Charles Barkley !
Let me say this now...ESPN is gonna f#$% up this show. You can tell by Chuck's body language that nothing is going the right way.
0:45😂  Barkley doesn’t know his work schedule? 😂😂 Is it a LIE or IGNORANCE? Neither?😂😂
They better get some of the rights if they’re going to some sort manning cast show
That's dumb they need to just air the espn games and have chuck and the crew on pre game halftime and postgame
10:05 😂 Barkley is not a hypocrite for calling out NBA players today. 😅 Barkley shows up everyday he said for his  $20 million a year salary.😅😅😅 He never complains working long hours and multiple days.😂😂😂😂
Dan got him https://youtu.be/O-2ayoUThmY?si=bWmnReydDWAq7OSY
Could Dan Patrick be any more annoying.
People would rather watch those four guys than a basketball game anyway
We need to get chuck some new black frame glasses
Load management is a team management thing as well. IDK why the players get all the criticism for this.
Sadly I think they should let the show die
I remember Chuck wearing the AJ12 in the taxi colorway when he was with Houston
Everyone should have agreed to step away and not move to ESPN. Let us fans remember it fondly with TNT. I believe it is a mistake.
Chuck with the grandmama glasses!
I thought Inside the NBA should have just ended the other night to be honest. I've loved the show forever, but I thought it would be better if they went out on top, rather than going to ESPN, Amazon, or NBC.   And after just listening to Chuck describe how things are going, I definitely think they shoulda just rode off into the sunset. All good things come to an end, and that's ok.
Every NBA player needs to take a page out of Robert Parish's book of longevity. Yoga
So no highlights for the new inside ?  That’s where they are at their best !  Plus, it’s going to be a parade of countless guests, irrelevant people that will take time away from the crew.  Man, best show in TV, regardless the genre has ended 😢
Companies make me sick. Want to talk deals and can't even tell people what they will be doing. Get your shit together..ESPN is just like every other company. Falling short every step of the way all the while demanding you walk the straight and narrow. Is it that hard to tell people what the F they are going to be doing? It's kind of important...friggin fools.
The biggest news from this conversation is that Charles Barkley's retirement from sports commentary (& the end of the primo Inside the NBA cast) comes in 2 years.
This dude says the same things every interview and repeats himself twice for every answer.
Other transcendent players: Moses Malone, Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving. He played with some greats but only listed the era Jordan played in.
Sir Barkley  is good people.  His honesty is rare.
My very favorite Nike basketball shoes were the Charles Barkley. I won a new pair in a free-throw contest and loved them!!
Charles said," We probably will be going up against NBA games. Anybody who likes NBA games aint gonna say, Let me turn off the NBA game that's on Amazon, ESPN." Chuck, we would rather watch y'all than an NBA game.
"Back in day phones were attached to the wall" -Old Head Chuck 2025
I thought he said he was going to retire?
Dan never misses an opportunity to yap about Michael Jordan
Chuck's about to say "Muy bien gracias" on ESPN Desportes now🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The inside the nba crew are bitter that tnt fumbled during the tv rights bidding process.
Somebody needs *to be honest* with Chuck about those glasses
So much money with steady decreasing viewers
Great follow up dan 10:20
They gonna make this show like super heros where people gonna say no more , sad thats the plot 😢
I don’t think Chuck realizes most people turn on games to watch them instead of the actual game lol, especially during the regular szn
Chuck got those glasses from George Costanza  They are from the Gloria Vanderbilt collection  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Inside the NBA will be to espn what daredevil is the Disney.
Barkley is a worldwide bball treasure
This was an awful interview
LMFAO! This already sounds BAD...
Sir Charles was right about Jordan as an owner.
He's what Bill Burr is to Conan - or what Conan is to other interviewers. Chuck's what you would call an interview "goldmine" - just ask the right questions and let him fill the airtime regaling you with the good stuff. Him actually answering the point of your question or not is irrelevant compared to the entertainment value provided.  But Chucks's also a wild buck, so interviewers definitely need the skill to rein him in when needed. Like Ernie does.
Everybody needs to be a little bit more like Chuck
How wide are Chucks lenses? Geesh!! 🤣
Are Charles, Kenny, Ernie gna still do March Madness?
STOP!!! working dude!!!!   you don't need it.  you are going to die with a working schedule   go have fun while you can
The move to ESPN will suck..
Sir Charles, nobody cares about nba games. Really. Last game I watched was SA - Miami final game. Your show jokes is the only reason to have minimum interest in nba
Lebron is a clown
NBA preseason starts the first week of October. The NBA Finals start the first week of June. OMG! In 9-months you may procreate a Baby.
I would rather watch Chuck and the Gang talk about NBA b-ball than watch NBA b-ball.
"you aint getting me on ESPN, ESPN2, Deportes, hahahaha"!!! chuck, don't worry it's not 2 years, it's really 1, you just spent an additional year repeating yourself.. hahaha.. love you chuck.
“To be honest with you.” - Charles Barkley, a gazillion times; every interview.
maybe ABC/ESPN will have them cover the Finals?
Its funny because at my cousin's wedding last year we all wore the jordan 4 all black and the brides maids wore the white and red ones it didn't pay any attention to it until Charles just said that
Magic would not be as good today. Not a good long distance shooter.
Why do the voices sound like they've been downtuned/slowed down?
I love that Barkley is such a blue-collar guy. That’s why Philadelphia loved him. No time for any BS and pampering. He appreciates all he got. He’s wrong about Kobe though. He’s not anywhere close to the top three there’s many other players that would be better to start a team with. You can start with Kareem even though I’m not a Lakers fan. Bird would’ve made a team better than he made his team and he ruined the Lakers the last few years with his bad personality and ball hugging and taking up all the money it was just a show took care of him when he sent him through ridiculous deal the great  Gasol
Charles is the GOAT!
ESPN sucks. It won't be the same.
Air Jordan bricks!
Chuck is the best!
TNT NEEDS to name that show Outside the NBA
Chuck is the goat!
He ask chuck one question and chuck goes on this rant on everything else except the question....That Got dang GOAT...MJJ...
Classic
ESPN and Prime will be a dope combo.
Thx for bringing us so much joy over the years Chuck! Salute to the NBA on TNT! 🫡👏🏽🏀
I’m surprised Chuck couldn’t find a bigger pair of glasses
Sir Charles lmao
i fully expect next season at halftime of the bucks/wolves games, chuck, kenny, shaq and ernie will be discussing the lakers.
GREAT!!!!!
chucky is becoming a regular now
3:30 love how straightforward Charles is
First
Love this show
