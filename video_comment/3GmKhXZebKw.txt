Bobby sounds like the deer bleat call from cotw
Evo voice box
5:29 I feel bad for Bobby bro theyre just laughing at him the whole time 😭
bro cant afford windows
1:23:00 its becuase it was supposed to hit firecracker but he put miner before it hade the time so he got there too
Huuuuuh
Christ. Ryley looks so fucking retarded
BOBBY WON. FAIR AND SQUARE.
Honestly this would have been better if ryley also played troll decks. He used meta decks and didn't need to on his level
1:24:00 you start counting fro the middle of the hitbox of the card (which is the center of its shadow) to the center of the hitbox of the gk. It's around 5 tiles so the conditions to connect are indeed met.
I can't see you very well. You should try moving closer to the camera.
MVP golden knight.
bobby held back so that the stream wouldn’t be 3 minutes long
We know Bobby got those 99 wins before stream
Riley using mighty miner and inferno dragon was so mean because he is one of the best in the world at punishing opponents for overspending elixir, and those cards are some of the scariest when left un-defended
Jynxzi no shot you will see this but this is one of my absolute favorite YouTube videos of all time. And that’s from someone who as avidly watched YouTube for over a decade.

Bobby's voice is goblin machinneeee

Boby is like the clow class
Bobby just started talking brain rot in the middle of jynxzi pee

Hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby
I AM Ryley 2.0
W bobby
36:34 ryley talking to bobby like hes 5😭✌️
23:31 bobby abused his mic😂
16:48 Goblin Barrel laugh
wow
Brazilian phonk lol
1:22:50 if you pause here, you can see Bobby’s golden knight was setting up to do his dash attack before the miner pops out so originally he was suppose to attack the mighty miner, the fire cracker,and the tower. It’s crazy on the last second the miner pops out in mid dash, forcing his golden knight to go to the closest target after attacking the mighty miner and then perform a huge launch to the fire cracker as if he was knifing his opponent in OG Modern Warfare 2. 💀  (Edited: I know I’m late af for this explanation 🥲)
Ryley’s laugh lowk sounds like the orange cockroach from the show “Oggy and the Cockroaches”
bobby is the squirtle of cr
Where can I enjoy this gameplay without Jynxzi's forced shouting?
bobby was doing this while sleepwalking btw
I made a drinkin game every time jynxi blinks take a shot
Why he sound like that
So cool bobby
Evo Edgar.

Chat bobby is so good in this game he is losing all the time only for his dump deck otherwise he is level is like MO
Evo MegaKnight hit the mighty miner before it died then the golden knight was able to chain this can only happen in a Bobby game
13:08 22:06 49:51

Lets be honest bro bobby was just edging ryley this entire vid
20:04 🚢🚢🚢
16:14 Bomboclat 🙏😭
36:55 bobby is so brainrot bro
This is funny as hell, I love seeing Riley
Leys laugh has evolved from a goblin to a fuckin horse since 2021
26:40  why is jinxy jonking it??
Yo Jynxzi, I'm new here and I don't mean to be rude, but why do you put everything into every blink? Again no hate, im just wondering.
Bobby is genuinely horrible but I just love the guy XD
I love Watch Idolmaster Cinderella Girls Hirazaki Parakeet Soldier!🔳💚
I love Watch Idolmaster Cinderella Girls Hirazaki Parakeet Soldier!🔳💚
Off topic but Jesus loves you all! ✝️❤️👑
Jynxzi  looks like steak ngl 😂😂😂😂😂
Why does Jynxi drink so much lol
I find it weird that ladder players don’t understand how golden knight works hehe. I could be wrong, but I think the distance between miner and firecracker is irrelevant. It started dash at miner, so everything within the dashrange from the miner will get dashed. It would be weird if he didn’t dash
I know Bobby is a decent player but he honestly should try instead of being a troll fr 😂
ryley got that peter griffin chin in the thumbnail
10:15 that laugh from bobby😂
“EEEEEUUUGGGGHHHHHH” 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Bobby is so real
1:02:47
This is griffith vs guts
Face crusher21
Bobby supporting small youtubers❤
24:42
Bobby is actually rlly good at the game specially at defense but he was js trolling for a while
Dude how many different drinks does jynxi have
wwwwwwwwpooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
So inspiring that Bobby used decks that were fun and Riley tryharded to counter them and king Bobby still came out on top. A voice that WE ALL love 🥹
They are both goblins
imagine serious bobby vs ryley 💀💀
Jesus loves you Romans 10:9
is bobby throath singing
36:30 ryley was treating Bobby like a kid with Down syndrome lmaooo
26:34 just look at that guy emoting
24:43 6 or 7?
was that a random thumbnail or what they looked like for real but like this feels like me and my brother I just randomly use what i thought was the best and he just cycles to beat it with cheap stuff but this was back in like 2018
5:28, 7:37, 13:06, 22:00, 27:52, 34:44, 38:30, 40:13, 49:52, 1:06:35, 1:12:00

Coughing baby vs hydrogen bomb
24:40 JYNXZI SAID IT CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
only 12 year olds find bobby funny 😂
Hard to tell whos named bobby on the thimbnail lol
Why is he screaming for no reason
almost choked to death from laughter AAAUUGGHH!!!!
Low effort jynxzi streams are so dumb. He doesn’t even try to crop the stream into the dimensions it should be.   Thats the community standard btw. 😮‍💨 😊
Ryley sounds so weird
Bro when Bobby says uncle he sounds like that one midget from South Park
24:41 6,7 😈
bobby is the greatest golden knight user
bro how does riley not know about brazilian phonk and mangos
ryley looks exactly like the big dude in the rascals card
man i cant watch this.. i actually cringe so hard when i hear people put on voices
i miss og charlie
if Bobby used monk he actually might of won at the start
No joke bobby is really playing good even with his troll decks
2:24 joker ah
I bet if i played this challenge I could win with 2,6 hog
I literally have to stop watching now because my ears are bleeding
Bobby needs to use monk for the rocket
1:24:03 wtfffffffffffffffffffff did he just said??????😂😂😂😂
Jynxzi and Ryley laughing and mocking straight is so annoying
Riley laugh is unbearable 0/10 watch
Who even is this Bobby. I don’t like him
bobby letting a new clash player win against his skill deck
Literal coughing baby vs. Hydrogen Bomb
It's not nice to make fun of disabled people
6 or 7 677777
Bro iv seen so many pekkas melted by inferno
24:37 6 7?
No more siege?
Bobby is so funny
I don’t know why but jynxzi gives fake loud reactions…
Honestly furnace need to be deleted from game after I seen this video. Btw bobby doesn't need to push. Pekka megaknight is always defend ninjas
Ryley just using gay ass deck like furnace and bisirkir and basically taking megaknight for endless walk
the golden knight dash is counted from the golden knight it self, and the golden knight has a hit range of 1 tiles when dashing, so if it dashes backwards it would be 1 tile closer so the tower. The firecracker was inside the goldenknight's range of 5.5 tiles, but then the firecracker push back for for 1 tile  after the golden knight locks on the firecracker, so the golden knight dashes for a total of 7.5 tiles.
I just matched Juan Cena A week agooo!! Got his A** whooped NGL! Ill Post the match now that I know who it is LOL
5:10 get tf out flowey
18:50 “Pekka Knight 2.6”
bobby is so funny lmao
24:42 💀 diddy 67
Uncle
coming back to this later but he stands around two tiles away from the miner cause the dash isnt on the same tile as the miner. So the cracker is perfectly in range. Love the contetnt and bobbert
Bobby is actually really good at the game despite all the troll decks he runs😭😭😭😭😭
23:31 which playboi carti song is this
Bro the way raylay talks to Bobby like he is his kid or sum has me laughing 35:45 the whole time jinko is gone 36:29 this part mainly just the way raylay says mango to bobby

Pls make some R6 videos pls
Jynxzi can never stop blinking
gonna be fr now, bobby was clearly trolling till last game, in the last game he just played well and using a  better deck. I think bobby is a good player just trolling so much and that's what does make him funny
evo blinking + evo huuuffff + evo laughing
That’s not true brother, a lot of people are deceived into thinking that they need those things or they are bound to it. Few people actually know the truth of Jesus
Someone tell me please who the heck is boby? A robot or human being? Maybe YouTuber
When is Bobby hot tub stream
24:40 6 or 7
this is just straight out cyberbullying
I can win 1 aginst ryley

jynxzi said 6 or 7😭
Was I the only one that heard 67?
OHHH MYYY DAYSSSS
Holy shit Ryley washed as fuck dude got shit on by a gooner this can't be real.  Not even top 100 players anymore in my eyes, at best top 1000 *maybe*.
Evo maxing

“i just came to the comments to rage bait and spread hate” trust gng everybody is deadpan so what’s the point i don’t get it
yo Jynxzi activate windows twin
Golden Freddy ah scream 49:56

Ryley Scooby doo ass laugh got me weak
Bobby is the funniest guy known to man
3:50 roblox old dead sound
Bobby has the voice of an angel
The bots are so nuts

6:46 why did riley start edging to bobby for a sec
If he used electro wizard when ryley was using the miner wallbreakers  mighty miner and inferno dragon deck he might have had a good chance at bringing the game close at least
Fun fact: bobby already won Ryley 99 matches earlier so he only needed 1 more win and he was toying around with ryley
HUUUUUUUUUUUUUU never gets old😂
7:29  evo pimple
How did he do that voice for 1h
1:18:37  pov: your playing mid ladder
the way riley giggles 😭
Tf is that cringe ass riley thumbnail image. You might have the worst thumbnails.
Ryley is soo positive ❤
Mmmmm bobby…..
Has bobby ever broken character
do “you vs the arena you deserve”
Bro sounds like he is screaming in agony while talking
It's not funny watching these guys pick on a retard lol
You’re a Bucs fan???
Ngl Clash Royale kinda sucks. During events it matches me against people with like 3k more trophies than me and in 2v2 quick matches it pairs me with afk players and full spell deck users like 40% of the time.
play siege i miss you:(
😂
I just realized he is the goblin emote
49:56 🤖🤖AAAAAA-- 🤖🤖AAAAAAAAAAA-- 🤖🤖🤖AAAAAAAAA--
we miss the r6 time
Where are siege videos?
jynxzi talm about sum "you got him when i got him" but he was using his meta evo witch before nerf with graveyard while bobby is using fucking megaknight pekka freeze baloon
2.6 skill cycle
1:12:46 "Well it has no health now" HAHAHAHA
Riley laughing and saying let’s go on the 19th win is such bm
27:52 BRO STILL HAS TRAUMA FROM KEN 💀
Bobby is Roz from Monsters inc with that voice 🤭
Just use electric wizard to counter inferno bro 💀
35:54 Riley is so innocent
I could beat Riley in 20 try
bobby just gave ryley all the wins ngl bobby solos
23:31 😂bro this guy is going viral for sure
Bruh every 20 matches is a band? These men must fuckin love jynxzi
18:43 Bobby doesn't need an air card if he knows that Ryley always uses the same deck which does not contain any air cards
Bobby sound like the new squirtle....
BOBBY YOU HAVE A CHANXCE HOLY SHIT
That golden knight dash was chopped 🫩
EVO PENIST-T
Bobby an Edgar 😭
Bobby is like the new squirtle in a way
5×4 tiles diagonal = √41 ≈ 6.4 tiles Golden Knight max dash/bounce range: 5.5 tiles    So the goal is out of range of Dash.  How he was able to still "travel" that much: dart to an intermediate target within 5.5 tiles, thus, to the next one, etc.; each hop ≤ 5.5 tiles, center-centers. Without a mid target, he cannot combine to cover the 5×4 diagonal in just one dash.
1:19:43 The Match Bobby Wins
Bobby x ryley is such a good duo
24:42
21:33 this play that ryley did was so smart and funny to watch, especially ok's reaction
35:53 ryley is trying to know bobby and he’s just trolling him i feel bad😭😭💔
yo
Try listening on 2x speed
DId the math...the Golden knight dash that won Bobby the game dashed 7.211 tiles to the firecracker from the miner. I think Bobby is hilarious and I don't wanna take anything away from his win, but Ryley should have won this game Bobby only won the game because the golden knights dash range is 5.5 tiles and it dash almost an extra two tiles to get the connection that won him the game.  Great video btw enjoyed watching it.
The only plausible thing could be that golden knight had already set a chain of dash but since might miner got pushed away gk just included the spawned miner and went back for cracker
1:24:10 the distance is stablished from the knight to the next card and the max distance determined with the pythagoras formula to get the distance with x and y. The tiles are counted as if they were a unit of measurement in either way.
Chopped Royale...💔
Jynxzi’s thumbnail makes my two uncles look so good 😍
Ryley worst pro player in the world. 0 CR league wins now and 0 CR league wins until he dies. #fraudwatch

Where’s the r6 jynxi
clash royale jynxzi is so washed
Is bobby acting that way for comedic effect or is he foreal?
How does anyone over the age of 12 find this funny, jynxzi is just pure cringe now it's so 🏳️‍🌈

Guys what's the best 3 elixir cost range troop to replace firecracker? I just came back to clash royale few weeks ago and I'm fighting more and more people who know how to activate king tower against firecracker and it's kinda annoying since it weakens my push
Bring back the r6 jynxzi

Im calling it Bobby is gonna become a streamer
Bro need to really need to stop and have some real life in the reality because he is nothing and very low intelligence, no personality emotion, no sense of self worth, no respectfully for him, and needs to get a real job than wasting on money to stream and videos because petty sure his parents might felt very regretful for his existence in life, and also feeling very disappointed in him for not doing the right things for lifetimes
I love how much everyone’s laughing this is wholesome
No way that’s Bobby real voice
what happened last time I saw you. You where always playing siege and now Clash royale? I am not hating on u nor clash I just never thought u would stop posting on siege

bro ryley literally takes bobby so serious
Bobby is a damn Edgar?!?!?!?
Why is this guy ALWAYS drinking SOMETHING. And like, it’s not even the same drinks. He just takes a sip every 3 seconds, then instantly gets a new drink, and does it again
this is the chopped offs of chopped offs
Is Bobby like an alien or something?  Why does he sound so weird?
activate windows wtf 😂😂
1:11:30 dih attack

Was there a rule against bobby like putting zap or ewiz in his decks
Guys checked this out i made a new deck and its been going good: fire cracker, hog rider, arrows, ice spirit , evo valk , evo cannon, larry and furnace
35:46 besides bobby’s shenanigans, this was actually pretty wholesome lol
is he using voicechanger?
Riley laughing everytime Bobby says, “ahhhhh” or “uggghhh” is hilarious. Half of Riley’s comments is just laughing.
Hey jynxi, i got cancer and my dream is to play against ryley. Is there any way i can play a match with him?❤
You should try my skeleton deck
22:08 goofy ahh mic 23:30 goofy ahh mic 2 49:56 goofy ahh mic 3
HUUUUU UNCLE🗣️🗣️🗣️
An hour and 24 mins of Ryley and jinxi losing it
Golden Knight ability locked on MM and Firecracker like a second before he placed his miner. Since he placed his miner closer to the MM than where the Firecracker was, it went back to its original lock. Then ofc the tower was right there so it went there after
Jynxzi wanted Bobby to loose so bad
evo penis
35:55  Riley: "What is your favorite music?? Bobby: Brazilian Phonk  I'm cracking up yoo 😂😂😂
It's always golden night
for everybody wondering how bobby won, clash royale has a mechanic coded where cards that are literally 1 hp and expected to die from another hit, the card you deploy will skip over it, the golden knight literally thought nah f the mighty miner it will die.
did we run out of ideas junky
What is this channel now?
bobby dogged on that goofball so easily lol
Why is Bobby in these videos
I can’t even tell if Bobby is a real person or not😭
Him against Ron😜

1:13:36 😂
24:42 did I just hear 6..-7
what the funk😭
Maybe the golden knight was bcuz since Bobby popped ability before miner appeared and maybe locked on two targets which were the Mighty Miner and Firecraker but the miner appeard right after and was closer so the golden knight also hit but the original target which was firecracker didnt get hit yet and since the disctance between the firecracker and MM was less than 5.5 tiles so the golden knight was able to hit the firecracker and also hit the tower idk this is all a theory
Lowkey I play Bobby decks it's pretty good I just adjusted it with more air unit and made it like a more sycle deck cuz I don't have boss banded etcetera
3:15 yall unironically watch jynxzi and enjoy it, it just blows my mind. is this really funny to you guys? jeez
I JUST REALISED RYLEYS LAUGH SOUNDS LIKE DEJI’S THATS WHY ITS SO FUNNY
Bobby is most infuriating being in existence
10:17 is goofy ash 😭

Huuuuwuuuuuu
Hhhhhuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Ruhhhhhhhhggggg

I got a crazy idea. You do one of these 1v1 videos where like Ryley or Mo have to 1v1 as many people as possible until they lose like 1 battle per person and like just in case they dont do lose u put a 100 battle limit
🗣️🗣️🗣️ 1:13:33 the evo nobody saw coming hahahaha ❤❤❤

Jynxzi I’ve been having a really bad week and I’ve been watching you and I just wanted to say you make me happy and I stop thinking about everything so thank you for making my day everyday
Is that the true voice of bobby ?
Bobby used 0.0000001 of his power
PLAY SIEGE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
Jynxzi should play cr with caseoh
bobby with 12345 battles wins L
Not sure if midladder king is the best compliment but Bobby owns it
Evo cough+Evo groan+Evo giggle = absolute cinema

The whole video is just Evo giggling
Riley the man who cracked the might minor
honestly i love jynxzi but this is like the diarrhea of youtube content

From me to you Jynxzi… pls end this Bobby shit now. He’s not funny. He’s actually so annoying
36:30 actual NPC dialogue
Only reason why jynxzi won is because ryley was bored
Not gonna lie we need a rematch cuz that golden knight was on crack or something.
Honestly don’t know how anyone can find Bobby funny. Just an idiot making stupid noises, so hilarious
chopped vs chopped
Agghhh
"I like this deck this is a good deck" *skips 10 seconds* *both towers are gone and clanking noise plays*

Riley has an ice spirit laugh
The fact that Jynxzi was muted and laughing whole time

Golden knight dashing 6 7 is legendary
Im starting to not like ryley really unlike able dude
Now bobby needs to beat Riley 100 times
Bobby got a radio voice

bobby is legit what I would imagine buggs the bunny be as a person
24:42😂🫴🫴
waite its lucky win?
bobby so freaking funny
Bobby only used 1% of his power
the golden knight dash distance refers to itself, not the tile that the target is on👍
i think the golden knight dashed 7 tiles cause it started dashing towards the firecracker before it shoots whcihc gives it around 1.5 tiles knockback backwards.
is bobby a make a wish kid or just acting?
“Caldo de pito”😭😭😭
23:23 AAHHAAHHAAHHAAHHAHHAHAAHHAHAA
Bro boddy's random's huhh orOhhhh are so funny sometimes i swear

Riley laughs like the ice spirit 😂
Day one of asking jynxzi to coach me in r6
All Jokes aside, it's genuinely impressive that Bobby can put up a real fight against Ryley while mostly running troll decks and doing his bit, and that he won after 23 games. Dude's actually pretty good behind all that trolling.

Greece built the world Rome copied it Everyone else borrowed it Without Greece… nothing of value survives Without Alexander… no Hellenistic fusion, no scientific bloom, no Eastern–Western bridgeYou know what’s truly shameful, little bro? α An Italian talking about civilization… ω When Greeks were carving marble into temples that still stand after 2,500 years, you were chasing squirrels in huts made of mud. . When Sparta trained boys at 7 to become warriors, your ancestors were crying when the fire went out. . When Athens invented democracy, Rome didn’t even know what alphabet to use. (Hint: it was Greek.) . Greece before 700 BC:  – Built colonies across Italy, Sicily, Libya, France, and the Black Sea – Developed medicine that still guides doctors today – Created drama, philosophy, logic, astronomy, ethics, art – Gave the world the Olympic Games and the science of the universe – Named the planets, the elements, the stars, and even the Muses – Taught mankind to think with reason, not myth . So I ask you: . Who taught you to THINK, Roman child? Cicero read Plato. Julius Caesar studied Alexander. Latin is soaked in Greek thought. And the word Italia? It comes from Italos, a Greek name. . Without Greece… Rome wouldn’t be a civilization. It would be a dusty village in the hills, praying to trees.. . Don’t ever speak of culture again. . Because here was born: . – Ethics: Socrates – Logic: Aristotle – Mathematics: Euclid – History: Herodotus – Medicine: Hippocrates – Strategy: Alexander the Great – Physics: Archimedes – Politics: Pericles . Alexander crushed the Persian Empire in 3 years. Your Caesar needed a lifetime and still cried when he read about him. Napoleon worshipped Alexander, but even he never walked across Asia and made kings kneel. . Alexander made the East Greek, made the world kneel, and made the gods jealous.. . You speak of glory? . Rome = Replica Greece = Blueprint Rome = Echo Greece = The Voice . We are the source. You are the shadow. . Hey Roman… . When I hear Thermopylae, when I see the Parthenon, when I whisper the name Alexander… . I shiver. . That’s something you’ll never feel. Because what you had was borrowed. And what we are is eternal. . Greece is a flame. You’re a museum. . This conversation is over. The god of War was Greek – not Roman. The god of Reason was Greek – not Italian. The Soul of the World… is Greek.  Remember that.  🇬🇷🦅🛡️⚔️🔥🌅🏛️🫒 ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ.You said Rome civilized Europe Let me remind you who civilized Rome first  Before Rome had a written language, Greece had philosophers debating on ethics and the cosmos Before Rome built arches, Greece had Parthenons and the golden ratio Before Latin existed, Greeks were writing Homer, Sophocles, Herodotus Romans didn't invent civilization, they inherited it from Hellas Even your gods have Greek names under the Latin paint  Rome copied, adopted, and translated the Greek world And when your empire collapsed, who kept civilization alive Byzantium Constantinople The second Rome, Greek in language, soul, and legacy While Western Europe fell into darkness, Greek monks preserved Aristotle, Plato, Galen Greek fire defended the East when the West couldn't even read its own past  And don't forget this Alexander reached India before Rome reached Britain He didn't just conquer He transformed continents Rome ruled Greece enlightened  Italy has history But Greece is history
EPIC FAN FACTS ABOUT THE ONE AND ONLY ALEXANDER THE GREAT:  1. He was the richest man in history and feared no one. 💰⚔️   2. He respected his army immensely, punishing anyone who betrayed him or tried to harm him.   3. He cried in front of a statue of Achilles in Troy. 🏺⚔️   4. Napoleon adored him and called him superior to all others.   5. He crushed 20 kingdoms in the Balkans within days or weeks.   6. He had visionary plans for the future: uniting peoples, a common currency, a global empire.   7. At 15, he was already leading barbarians and founding cities.   8. In every battle, his enemies suffered 20–200 times more losses than his men.   9. He completely destroyed Thebes, sparing only the house of Pindar and the temple.   10. He fought on the front lines, broke bones, and killed generals and kings with his own hands.    ⚡ +10 MORE EPIC FACTS THAT FEW KNOW:  11. When his soldiers refused to march into India, he stayed in his tent for days, silent and without food, until the men begged him to speak again—demonstrating near-divine authority.   12. During the siege of Gaza, he climbed the ladders first, was severely wounded by a catapult to his shoulder, yet continued fighting until the wall fell.   13. In India, during the siege of the Mallians, he jumped alone into the city before his troops could follow, killing dozens until an arrow struck his chest. His soldiers saved him at the last moment—he was inches from death. 🥶⚔️   14. He punished guards harshly when betrayed in Philotas’ conspiracy but showed mercy to enemy kings’ families, like Darius III’s wife and daughters, treating them as his own sisters.   15. At 22, in the Battle of the Granicus, he charged first on horseback across the river, facing an army with twice as many cavalry and infantry—something no other general dared.   16. He personally made offerings to the gods before every battle; his soldiers saw him as a divine leader, not just a general.   17. When his men suffered from thirst in the Gedrosian desert, he refused water brought in a golden helmet, pouring it on the ground to show equality. ⛓️⚖️   18. Upon conquering Persepolis, the richest palace in Asia, he burned Xerxes’ palace as revenge for the Persians’ burning of Athens.   19. After the Battle of Gaugamela, instead of executing prisoners, he said: “Darius is no longer their king—now they are my people”—showing he wanted unity, not just conquest.   20. When he died, his generals asked who would inherit his empire. His reply was: “τῷ κρατίστῳ” (= “to the strongest”). This sparked wars among his successors, ultimately fragmenting his empire. ⚡     ---  MORE LEGENDARY FACTS (BONUS CHILLS):  He was the only king who personally trained his soldiers in new tactics.  His horse, Bucephalus, allowed no one near him but Alexander. After Bucephalus died, he founded an entire city: Bucephala. 🐎  To allied kings, he spoke gently; to traitors, he was harsher than a punishor.  Even seriously wounded, he kept fighting—Plutarch records over seven severe battle wounds.  He saw himself as a new Achilles, always carrying the Iliad, which he read before battles.  His generals dared not look him in the eyes when he was angry—they revered him as a god.  He planned not just to conquer Asia but also the West (Rome, Carthage). If he hadn’t died young, the entire known world might have been one empire. 🌍🔥   ---  EXTRA LEGENDS PEOPLE RARELY KNOW:  In Pella, before the world knew his name, seventy young men drank wine in a contest of endurance. One by one they fell, unable to survive the night. Only one remained upright, eyes blazing, unyielding—Alexander the Great. ☠️🤯🥶  Before the first Battle of Chaeronea, he trained relentlessly while other princes slept. His lance struck faster, his mind sharper. Every enemy underestimated him… and all fell. ⚔️🔥  On the march to India, his soldiers begged him to stop. Monstrous armies, raging rivers, scorching deserts blocked the way. Alexander ignored all. Not men, not gods, not fate itself could stop him. 🛡️🌊☀️  When the sun scorched Gaugamela, he rode into the heart of Darius’ army. Arrows darkened the sky, spears reached for him, yet he moved as if the world itself parted. ☠️🏇🤯  In India, fighting Porus, elephants charged like living mountains. His men faltered, but Alexander leapt into the fray, cutting through beasts and men alike. Courage eclipsed mortal fear. 🐘⚔️🥶  When rivers threatened to halt his march, he didn’t build bridges. He waded through currents, forging a path, undefeated by nature itself. 🌊🛡️🔥  He drank not as a man, but as a king destined for the heavens. Every cup, feast, and challenge was another arena to prove he was no mere mortal. 🍷🤯🥶  Even the gods watched in awe. When storms raged, he rode through laughing at thunder. When fate whispered warnings, he roared louder. Olympus itself trembled before him. ⚡🛡️⚔️  When all thought the world had limits, he pressed further. Cities surrendered without fight; armies dissolved at his approach. He carved a path through history, undefeated in spirit. 🌍🔥🥶   ---  💀 Note on his empire: Despite his brilliance, Alexander died at 32. His plan of uniting the known world under one rule fell apart because he left no clear heir—his empire was divided among his generals, the Diadochi, leading to fragmentation. His vision of a global empire was never fully realized.  10 more legendary facts about Alexander the Great  1. Even in his last battle in 325 BC against the Mallians in India, Alexander faced an army of 90,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and around 900 war chariots, while he himself had only about 6–7,000 men. His losses were just dozens or at most a few hundred, while the Indians lost tens of thousands, almost their entire army.   2. At the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, Alexander faced Darius III with over 200,000 men (some ancient sources say even 1,000,000), while Alexander had only about 47,000. Despite being vastly outnumbered, he won a decisive victory that ended the Persian Empire.   3. When Alexander was severely wounded in India (an arrow pierced his lung at the walls of Multan), his soldiers thought he was dead. To prove he was alive, he struggled to raise his hand, covered in blood, and his army erupted in cheers, refusing to leave him.   4. Alexander the Great was undefeated – the only general in history who never lost a single battle. From the Granicus to Gaugamela to the Hydaspes and beyond, he was invincible against every enemy, in every terrain, under every condition.   5. At the Siege of Tyre in 332 BC, the city was on an island with walls 50 meters high. Everyone said it was impossible to conquer. Alexander built a massive causeway across the sea, under constant attack, and after seven months stormed and took the "unconquerable" city.   6. Crossing the Gedrosian Desert (today’s Baluchistan), one of the most lethal deserts on earth, thousands of his men collapsed from thirst. When some soldiers found a helmet full of precious water and offered it to him, Alexander poured it on the ground in front of everyone, showing that if his men could not drink, neither would he. This act saved morale and made his soldiers worship him even more.   7. After defeating King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes, Alexander did not kill or enslave him, but instead restored him to his throne and even gave him more territory, saying: “Such a man should be my friend, not my prisoner.”   8. When a mutiny broke out at the Hyphasis River because his men refused to march further into India, Alexander did not force them. Instead, he shut himself in his tent for days in silence. His men, ashamed, begged him to return as their leader. This showed not just fear, but deep love and respect.   9. At the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, Alexander faced the Persian King Darius III for the first time. Darius fled the battlefield, abandoning his own family. Alexander captured his wife, daughters, and mother – but treated them with royal dignity, as if nothing had happened. Even the Persians admired his honor.   10. In Egypt, when Alexander entered the temple of Amun at Siwa Oasis, the priests hailed him as the “son of Zeus-Ammon.” This wasn’t just flattery – it made Alexander a living god in the eyes of the ancient world, a title no mortal before him had ever claimed so openly."
Nah the I only listen to Brazilian funk while eating mangos 😂😂😂
Nigga i cried when bobby won
Hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby ahh
Jesus loves us and died for us to be saved

One of the most annoying people I’ve ever heard
“Bobby stop jerking off 👺🔥🤬
i think ryley just trolls on the 23rd lol
riley gaining more and more social skills
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GIVE UP ON THE GAME THAT MADE YOU

That gooldeen kniiiight actually go insane
I remember sidge
Starts yapping 0:00 stops 1:24:26
Why do the streams always end before it’s done
where is r6 fuck clash royale
1:22:59 Using Pythagoras theorem, if the miner was on the highest tile possible for Ryley's side, that means that the firecracker was 6 tiles down and 6 tiles to the left. This means the golden knight chained ≈8.5 tiles away, which is obviously not allowed. This means one thing: If the golden knight chains to a troop, then it can use the troop to continue the chain so that it doesnt exceed the tile limit. The only thing that allowed the golden knight to chain so far is the mighty miner.
is bobby playing or is he acctually special i need a answe
do a 99-0 against ian77
The way how he didn't even react to the new r6 op tho makes this guy a clash royal full time streamer😢

Jynxzi vs Ryley 100 matches?
Crazy how this battle shows the mental side of Clash — Bobby defending a perfect run vs Ryley playing free with nothing to lose. Mindset matters as much as the deck.
Left off here 1:09:17
AAAUUUUUGGGGHHHH
You can tell clash helped Riley come out of his shell and it’s honestly awesome to see how far as a person he’s came since the beginning
Props to ryley for being down to play up to 100 games
One of the greatest players in the world vs ryley
king tower deactivation
Why is bowler yapping
I’m so tired of these annoying put on persona’s
if you pythag that last golden knight dash I think it went square root of 40 tiles or like 6.35 or something, maybe it had already routed to the firecracker and the miner spawning made the code act weird?
No junko you can't just bring the big guns just bc you lost to a midladder menace
24:44. 6.7
1:14:31 best dish of all time🌹❤️‍🩹🔋🥹

You know a lot of people discuss how junko has an affect on games. What about his effect on the people he plays with? I could be sorely mistaken, but I feel like juicy and Riley have both grown so much in terms of personality on camera like he pulled them out of their shell almost. Ima look into it
“👃 👃 👃 👃 👃 👃 👃 👃 “  😩😫
The new squirtle😭😭
It’s like he’s still with us, fly high junko rip
I love bobby

What’s up, bro. Can you give my new clan a shout out? It’s called ⚡️TEAM WATER⚡️ Ima give out a diamond pass every season to one of the best players in the clan.
Who else thinks Jynxzi should start at 99 and Riley at 0
bobby is the goat i swear
"EEEEUGHHHH" "lock in uncle" 💔🥀💔🥀

90k views in 2 hours bro fell off hard 💔💔💔
bro won by 6 7
11:00 “how did he defend” and he just has an evo furnace between his towers demolishing everything😅
You should do a 99 to 1 challenge with your dad in clash😂😂😂
Bobby is insufferable. Theres no way people genuinely think that shit is funny
2:13
Someone put R2D2 into human form and they named him Bobby
This Bobby guy is soooo annoying and cringe
Evo blinking while watching rascals vs little prince

Ken and Bobby next 😂?
35:42  Brazilian funk 😂😂😂
10:16 Goblin Barrel Laugh

Evo blinking, evo laughing and evo talking all in one d*ck?? Gotta be hacked
Yay
7:30
Ryley vs Ian77 would be the battle of the goats.
1 hour gang
Ryley having the time off his life😂
"HUFFFFF" someone gotta nerf ryley please❤️‍🩹
24:40 67
I love filling up small part time streamers with my own all natural milk
You should change it to 15 wins instead of 100 tbh
am i the only one who thinks bobby sounds like squirtle putting on a voice.
This is peak cinema!!😂
Bobby the new Xim fr
Hmo what if browney did a Ryley 90 day.
This sounds like bullying, lol
jynxzi so annoying

6:47 Ryley gets his log cycled
Bobby just be trolling bruh
S.. Stompn and C... Charlie?

Same guy that cracked evo brenard

evo blinking + evo uncle + evo groaning = the funniest trio
I could beat him on first try
DAMNN IT ALL UNCLE!!
4:20, bobby w 12345 battles won
evo chainsaw vs evo hyena
actually unwatchable
2:40 "Another drill" when its the first drill of the game😔
7:40 dawg im crying
49:58 😊
Why does Bobby sound and act like an autistic child. Bro sounds like the slug off monsters inc fr  - ya’ll like this brain rot?? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Balllright
Love ever since you started collabing with Riley, you guys are such a good duo. Also Bobby addition has been great
xQc: evo talking jynxzi: evo coughing ryley: evo laughing
You should do ken vs ryley next
Uggghhhh
Bobby swallowed a kazoo or smth
26:41 what is brochacho doing with his arm while listening to bobbys voice
Balright
24:43 did he just say, s- si- six seven
Chopped vs chopped 😭✌️💔🥀
Ryley sounds like a gang beasts character 😭
bobby sucks
UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖
You gotta be a kid to find bobby funny, shits retarded
This shit is so ass compared to watch siege fuck man, fuck this bullshit
BRING BACK R6
Nothing is impossible to man he try - Alexander the great
Rileys confidence off rip had me shaking in my boots
mustaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard
I like Bobby’s play style better despite the fact that there crazy, he’s offensive, he don’t defend. Ryley is just a defensive dec and once defended he goes in w chip damage there both just different styles 😂
So we’re in bone pit
Guys just spamming the ticks at this point
Ryley got the goblin laugh 😂
Where did Bobby come from lmaoo
It’s shaggy’s turn
hooray
bobby my king
Early
to explain the golden knight it was because it was around 7 tiles from miner to firecracker and both miner and firecracker have 0.8 tile hitbox and if you subtract the two together 1.6 - 7 the dash distance was only 5.4 tiles which is inside golden knights dash range which is 5.5
Evo uncle vs Evo groaning
It’s like he’s still with us🥀
Bros editor is so fast this was like 10 mins ago
