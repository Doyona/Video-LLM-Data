Little angry men .Lil man's syndrome. Angry Little chuauas
Ahhhhhhhhhhh me no understandy, never, never, never trust anyone that you can blindfold with their own shoelaces.
I can just imagine what George is like to his employees 😂😂😂
Māori should be ashamed of themselves.Those snapper were disgustingly undersize.
Ridiculously small penalties, and that is why the offending continues. Maybe something like $100 fine for every under-size and same for every one over the limit. That would add up and make the criminals think twice. I also think if the offence is serious enough, the boat, possessions, and the vehicle should all be confiscated. Really tough laws will almost stop offending completely.
The finds have to be increase
This is ridiculous should be in jail sent back to there own country,,  coming to over here and destroying our stocks of fish , the government needs to stop letting everyone in this country 💯
12:13 .... Why does it look like he has bird shit all over his belly
People that take undersized fish in quantities like that need to be jailed.
Why are the Fines So So LOW"??? I hate these Sort of People!!! Taking everything and anything!!! Try do what you are doing in NZ" In South Australia!!!  JAIL BOYS. And you call your SELFS FISHERMEN. How F.....k...n  Sad. From South Australia...😔😪👎👎👎💘💘💘
These poachers should be jailed
Jesus these coconuts are greedy
The Auckland Zoo Could of had Those Poor Fish.😢😢😢
(110) Poor Snappers and (1) Innocent Kahawai.😢😢😢
What a garbage system.  Questioning them about their knowledge or intent?  Who cares?  It should be an absolute liability offence.  You're caught with excess/undersize, ergo you're a criminal and have a criminal record, with prison sentence or a ball-tearingly punitive financial penalty.  And forfeiture of any property involved in the crime, up to and including a house or land where fish is stored or processed.  The current system rewards criminals and guarantees the loss of our birthright as kiwis.
Deport them
Jail time for all the losers and take there vehicles so they can't get another boat
They don't need all those fucking fish
Penalty too light
And as the night time falls love this officer blessings brother 🎉❤🎉
Great work team. Sickening to see offences like this. They should be banned from fishing
I don't get it what's wrong with them fishing for snapper can someone tell me
They taste better great flavour,we will never run out of fish they fall from the sky.
The fines are a bloody joke. Deport the bastards.
How tf did these overstayers get there boat back come on fisherys be more fkn ruthless otherwise your working for nothing
I feel bad for those little fishes
Wota fukn waste
They should be in jail, they know what there doing scum bags .
Pure greed 👎
Gary's a bit of a no nonsense unit. He tells this aggressive bozo what's happening and that's that. I like the cut of his jib.
Greedy people
These videos are really good, I get close enough I feel like it gets the job
Makes my blood boil🤬 always friggen foreigners
Hang on - why are the confiscated fish not being fed to the needing?
What a crock of shit these racket is . Taking boats , fines , yet throw the fish away and where duds the money go ? Nowhere good I would imagine 😂 .
As I watch your videos you guys a a serious problem with over fishing and poaching you seriously need to increase the fines $$$$
They know better. They should have been jailed!
What I don't understand is why throw the fish back into the sea, doesn't Australia have state ran children or old people homes where the fish can be donated?😢😢😢
The tames fishermen selling it for profit
The Fisheries should take the cars as well as the boat is attached to the car, I see most of the people caught were natives of New Zealand.
Dumping the fish in the sea is ludicrous, with all of the folks who go hungry every single day!  Looks like the poachers have all the rights and no serious punishment.  These poachers know exactly what they are doing.
This is terrible. I would have definitely taken there boat .
Wo uses the word "Buster"??
Wtf is the point on throwing the dead fish back in the ocean? Just eat it bro, that was just stupid and a waste of food.
Such a shame to see so many fish go to waste. That is the real cost of illegal fishing.
I get so annoyed with these types of people. They don't think of the future - what it means for the environment - only what THEY want. So selfish.
Lmao is it really worth it to get over the limit I don't understand why people do it. Selling it probably not worth much and fish is not the best tasting compare to beef.
Penalties are a joke. Need much harsher punishment for destroying a fishery.  In Florida it's a huge problem. How do you put a price on these kind of abuses? It's a selfish act.
Fined $3,500 for dumping all those undersized snapper! That's peanuts! Fine should be 10 times that. Ridiculous
great so you upload a what 40 years old tv show jesus f
This is why New Zeeland waters and Reefs are Healthy.Not like the US waters
$500 fine. what a joke. Its well worth taking the risk with the price of fish.
You should be taking there vehicle and also, thats part of the crime
The fines are peanuts.
It seems silly the fish go to waste.
The fishermen messed up 😊by not obeying the fishing rules
Man, what a waste of good fish. Sad.
bet you couldn't get funding for this show we Jacinda controlled NZ on Air...You would break her special little rules
It’s just porgy.  100 undersize porgy will get you a $50 fine here in the states.
should fine them a big time
Dumping the fish in the sea is utterly stupid in my opinion. They should give the fish to families in need instead.
if i'm over the legal limit for drinking I go to jail, this persons brain thinking is over the limit
increase amount of the fine to $500 PER FISH, take the boat, all fishing equipment, banned for so many years cannot fish,
stop call mate , HES  not ya mate, he's a fucking arss hole.  taking undersize, and he knew it,
He does look like Charlie Chaplin,lol
you laws are to soft no wonder they keep doing it what a joke they need there Boat taken and jail time .
Waste of kai aye
Such a waste to dump back in sea. Should keep the seized fish and sell to restaurants and put profits back in conservation efforts.  These small time fishermen are not the problem. They only catch a tiny fraction of what the commercial boats do
So greedy they kept 100 snapper, just take what u need and a feed for couple days, why do u need to take so many just ridiculous
Heck give me some of those snappers
Aw come on now don’t get mad that you’re caught George 😡🤬 😤you’re getting a free ride in a 👮‍♀️ police 🚓 isn’t that cool 🥶🤭
You always have people who try and cheat the system m. They know what the rules are when it comes to fishing ain’t that right George. You’re mad now George
A slight inconvenience, nothing more!
Angry small men, always proving a point!!
They should give those seized fishes to poor people/charity associations.
Is that fishing vessel seaworthy?  At 0.55 it looks like most of the hulls external layer of steel on the port side has rusted away.  If that bloke has people working for him how is that a safe workplace? The skipper and his crew made absolute mugs of themselves remonstrating about the cameraman.  Hopefully they have some friends who can get through to them.
Now that’s a great job thank you
Such a waste of life by the poachers AND the fishery police. Those should have been given to local hospitals, elderly homes and other places with people that can actually use them. Instead they're getting dumped into the sea where some may get eaten, some may not.
Boats and petrol are expensive.
Which country is this?
These people have no  respect for our fishing laws . Stupid people
Happening 24/7 all around the world. Its a joke!
At least they should of given the fish to a homeless shelter for the needy.
Immigrants should be deported!
Pure greed nothing else
Great show.👍
Even 7 snapper per person is to many
Just greed, not thinking about anyone else, good job officers, fines should be blindingly high, really sad these Muppets don't care and will just do it again.
I think in every country you should lose all your rights to fish if you over fish and take and keep the fish you are not supposed to keep
Seems like an absolute waste of fish dumping them back out at sea. What a joke. Fines were less than the cost of a rod. This is just sad.
Limits are necessary. Good job.
Waste of fish
stupidly small fines.  Take the boat for 12mths and charge the storage fees at $120 a week.
Piss weak
all a waste of time 😂😂 they get a minimum fine keep there boats and off they go 😂😂 like having a dog that barks but doesn't bite 😂😂 at least donate the the fish to shelters that would be the best outcome coz catching these grubbs is a joke 😂
That was _________ but I would have preferred ______ insight________ given the_____ of the  _____events leading_____in cases like_____overseas are more_____ and lead to________longer.
Yep jail
Fisheries should be able to take them home to their families and not waste any food 🐟
Why can't the seized fish be donated  to a food shelter or charity? Such a waste if they're already dead
If it’s anything like our system in America, it is a vertically integrated system where large fish market, billionaires and millionaires on the quota, and actually make more sitting on their butts in front of a computer selling their quota to actual fisherman that make $.50 a pound or more less Than the person selling the quota before expenses and time.. it’s pretty messed up when you’re talking eight dollars a pound wholesale and the guy you’re selling to you had to buy the quota for 450 a pound and that fat cat never gets out of his chair never spends a dollar just gets free fish plus $.50 a pound… the fisherman, make nothing other than a sore back.. but that’s the way of capitalism. I guess I love capitalism, but crony capitalism where certain rich people are given as much as 8% of the total snapper allotment for the country like the guy in Galveston Texas who happens to have his own restaurant of fine dining and seafood market so he’s getting his fish for free plus $.50, then cooking it selling one fillet for $40 it’s freaking astounding, the fundamental unfairness.. it’s the same exact model they use for medical marijuana in Florida and our governor as much of a liar as he is said that it was Paramount to a state and enforced drug cartel by only allowing seven companies to handle marijuana of any kind from seed to Customer.. now that’s organized crime why is it not organized crime to do it to the fisherman.. Factors our season has been cut down to 30 days at times and if you’re going on the weekend that’s maybe four days a month if the weather is good I got two snapper last year!!!!!! because of quotas for rich people
The same as they trash their own property, they trash the ocean and earth. 🤡🌎
What is the difference between snapper vs scub or porgy?
Those jokers need to be arrested. The laws are to soft on those poachers.
Man, no handcuffs. No extensive force. We Yanks could learn a thing or two from you all.
Always too soft on these thieves....community service is a freakin' joke.......
Simply greed nothing more nothing less.
It's so upsetting to see people have such little respect for nature and the destruction of it.
Seems stupid that you would puncture and waste the fish when it could be given to the community instead
it's good to see the fines being given , but I feel the fines are too small  and in fact they are a joke .
Snapper favourite fish 🐟🐟🐟 very hard to find in Australia now north NSW
The result of being ignorant, arrogant, and dumb....a slap on the hand with a wet bus ticket.
These people should be put in jail
THANK YOU SO VERY VERY VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE WHO WORK FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICES.
