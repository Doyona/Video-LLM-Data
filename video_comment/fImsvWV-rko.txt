He’s not ready for Jai or Dmitry Bivol or beterbiev
Benavidez wife looks like she just with David for money
18:29
18:50 “without trauma there cant be no greatness”
But I wanna see this guy with Dmitry Bivol
Please can we have more of these types of videos please
So No one gonna comment on the baddies the Benavidez pulled 🍑
Addicted to watching all access.
Saludos Campeón 🎉🤔😏☝️👋🌎🎱🌍🌐👾🎆🎉

Where’s the Epilogue episode???
They won at life🎉
Is there going to be epilogue?
When boxers show up wearing reading glasses 🤓 than maybe your heart isn’t in the game more like fashion
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE KISS ASS BIAS BLIND EYEING CUNTS WOULDNT ADMIT 1. THAT WAS A PUSH DOWN AND NOT A KNOCKDOWN (THIS IS THE MINOR PART) 2. THAT A 6'3 DAVID WHO IS A WEIGHTBULLY OF SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT WISHES ONLY TO TARGET THOSE SMALLER DUDE THAT CAME UP TO THAT DIVISION WHO ARE FAR SMALLER THAN HIM.  3. WHAT HAVE I BEEN SAYING IS HEIGHT SIZE MAKES CHIN MAJORITY WISE AND AS MANY AS I HAVE PINPOINTED IN THE PAST TO PROVE IT THIS IS ANOTHER PROOF OF THAT FACT. 3.1 IT AINT BECAUSE ANDRADE 6FT (BUT WAS NEVER A PUNCHER EVEN ON THE LOWER DIVISION) ISNT CONNECTING BUT BECAUSE DAVID CAN TAKE ANDRADE'S PUNCHES SPOILER ALERT THAT WOULD ALSO HOLDS TRUE WITH CA AND THE SAME REASON WHY CA LOST TO BIVOL BECAUSE THESE BIGGER GUYS HEIGHT SIZE CAN TAKE THE SMALLER GUYS' BEST SHOTS AND PEOPLE INVOLVE AND MEDIA AND FANNIES WANTS TO BLIND EYE SUCH TRUTH THE TRUTH IS IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE AND IT WILL HURT ONE LEGACY BADLY TAKING OUT THE REAL TRUTH WHICH I HAVE BEEN MENTIONING AND HELPING THESE WEIGHTBULLIES TAKE CREDIT OVER LESSER BOXERS NOT BECAUSE OF SKILLS BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST TOO BIG AND I HIGHLY QUESTION DAVID HE DOESNT SEEM TO WANT TO FIGHT HIS OWN HEIGHT SIZE TOP BOXERS. I PREFER DAVID VS ZURDO OR BIVOL OR BETERBIEV JUST AN FYI DAVID IS BIGGER THAN THOSE 3 BUT THEIR PUNCHES STINGS TO THE DIVISION THEY ARE IN SAME OR HIGHER. IF ANDRADE'S PUNCHES STINGS THOSE COULD HAVE DROP DAVID BUT AS SEEN HE CANT KEEP UP WITH VOLUME PUNCHING HE GOT TIRED YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR TOES AND RELENTLESS TO BEAT A BIGGER DUDE BEST EXAMPLE IS MP VS AM. 4. BUTTOMLINE STOP THE DUMBNESS TO MAKE A CA VS DAVID FIGHT A  5'9 VS 6'3 SUPER DUMB IT WILL HURT CA ONLY SMH THESE NON TRUTHFUL ENTITLED BRAINLESS FANS IF THEY CARE AND FAN OF CA THEY WOULD ALSO ANALYZE THINGS WITH RIGHTFUL LOGIC. SMH
🇲🇽 Monster!
206
I like both guys. David especially since hes a humble respectful fighter.
Is there not a part 2?
R.I.P all access 😢
Amazing. Thank you, showtime.
Respect for both fighters.  Andrade and David are so professional, may the best win
This is gonna b a great fight
Benavidez is my favorite Fighter to watch, but I am rooting for Andrade.  Hopefully Jose can get a big time win tonight for the of the family
Man always, always avoid a Mexican fighter
Jose Will get ko d cold
Marquez is a HUGE canelo hater and here he is praising benavides haha I swear to God people root for benavides just cause they want to see canelo fall. They're mad they couldn't get the same fame and money that canelo has
Benavides reminds me of Jake Paul. So proud of beating so many tomatoe cans
Showtime boxing is sometimes better then the fights
I thought the beginning was the start of mobb deep shook one’s pt2
Benavidez is the legends favorites cause they hate canelo lmao
No episode 2 though
Notice how the nation loves to blow up all race boxers that are not black. Smh.
Respect for both fighters.
Wait!! Showtime Boxing is leaving??
flatfooted boys trained by a bum gonna taste sum slaps
фраза "мы начали вместе, вместе и закончим" - пророческая. старшой влетит 100%, надежда на Димку Андрейда
ima GGG fan, but i think boo boo could beat him, and i wish boo acquire what he desereves
Lol Marquez is a 🤡 stays hating on Canelo 🥊
Seems like a mismatch
Damn…when Julio Chavez told him, we are waiting for you to fight Canelo you know it’s big!!😮
This fight is gonna be good 🫡
"Seattle" we know that's Renton lol
We lost HBO 24, and All Access will soon be dead and buried. Boxing will be left to the corny herbs at dazn. They would never give us a video like this.
I feel like canelo will piece up David like TC did ej. All hyped
I really cannot belive Netflix will takeover some of the boxing events.   I don't even think they would be able to create masterpieces like this (All Acess)  or  HBO's 24/7 without putting some weird shii like they do on their shows 😅🥴
RIP Showtime Boxing 🙏
The brother ain’t gonna beat Charlo.. facts.
Why’d everybody saying by showtime?? What happen
If you close your eyes hard enough Demetrius sound like Mike Tyson lol
I gotta feeling Jose gonna steal the show....
I think this gonna deliver on what we hoped Spence v. Crawford would....
Andrade looks crazy asf😂
Andrade is a basic fighter,you can tell how he throws punches
Who TF put this on ppv 😂 just bc its a good fight doesn't mean it's ppv worthy. Neither of these guys are close to being stars
Bro them old school fighters definitely like benavidez more than canelo lol
21:12 anyone else catch this? Nigga said “el mencho” Bro about to get shot
Boo-boo promoting steroids for boxing in showtime
The old Mexican greats wanna see Canelo loose so bad they'll root for a Mexican American 🤣 🤣 🤣 they low key hate Canelo😅
Benavidez u better walk … the dog!! Chavez knows how.
That Mexican OT.. BENAVIDEZ ring entrance
Manuel Marquez de caga palo
Hope they do big ppv sales. Too guys easy to door the.
U wan pay day?
Boo Boo for THE WIN period !!!
boo boo @21:45 has me dead. this guy hilarious bro, love it
I'm rooting for booboo for some reason, something different bout him and it's likeable...perhaps even special.  I guess we'll see.
Canelo is the real Mexican monster 💪✍️
I see where benavidez's money  go! A lot of plastic surgery
More cannon fodder for Benavidez
I disagree with David's 'coting your head gesture' Booboo may beat him up too.
Benavidez is gonna win 🙌🏼
Benavid3z is the boogy man
Benavidez jab is going to be a nightmare
Andrade tell beny his dad loves him get in his head thanx for this vid. Old mand trying to be to stubborn to say love you. 😢 i can see the outcome
She got her p on a leash 😂 walking around with a full diaper on lol
Damn sucks showtime boxing ending
David’s wife needs to stop the plastic surgeries! Looks out of proportions and just awkward!
This fight is bigger than Spence-Crawford fight!
It's hard to see anything but a Benavidez win here. Boo Boo is 35 and fighting in his third weight class, not as fast as he used to be, and he's also not exactly a huge puncher. Plant played a good spoiler making David not look as good as he was supposed to, but I think Plant is  a better fighter than Boo Boo and naturally bigger, too. I think David should take this in 9 at most.
I put my money on Andrade by ko
Jose Benavides jr wasn’t even sweating 😭
"They dont try to change BooBoo🤣🤣🤣" Me neither cuzz
Every single professional has to go to a dark place to get to where they’re at. Most don’t show it. Benavidez senior knows he worked those boys til they dropped. No love. But now look at them. Champions. Can’t say he did too much wrong in my opinion. At least they had a dad.
Benavidez is great, andrade is good, Benavidez has fought higher level opponents than andrade has fought and David demolished them, David will come forward and chase down andrade,  andrade will not trade after seeing what Power David has, andrade will stick and move and counter punch, David has beaten better boxers than andrade and or equal to andrade, andrade has not faced the level of great boxer David is, it will be a good fight but David will wear down andrade and pick him apart, thank You Showtime Boxing for the great episodes you have displayed,  giving respect and adoration to all the cultures each boxer represented.
“Boo-boo took the book of boxing, opened it up and said nah” yea no shit. It shows. Benevidez in 5
BEnavidez me parece x este pelea lo tenes a mano... boo'boo.. it seems like ur tryna change ur style @35 idk its gonna be difficult come fight night  igual exitos a los dos y un abrazo a ti grupo benavidez no pun intended
there is a 9 year age difference. will that make a difference?
Benavidez will hand Andrade his first loss.
STAGE FIGHT, WE KNOW WE WANT TO SEE CANELO VS BENAVIDEZ
His chick is dangerously close to being de la Hoya’s Saw monster looking plastic chick. Fake ass all that….ease up girl!
Man this was awesome Good luck to both im going with Boo boo I've been boxing with him since we were young
At the press conference Benavidez spent more time arguing with Charlo than the man he's actually fighting.
andrade is so weird man i love it lol i can't imagine benavidez losing to anyone in the world at the weight right now and that includes canelo  but andrade will be especially tricky and he's probably gonna do well fighting backwards and pick the right counter punches to slow down benavidez. still hard to imagine benavidez losing.
i have Andrade to win by UD/SD
Demetrius is a damn mouth runner. I hope he loses miserably
Let Benavidez win and fight the ducking Canelo
This fight will be fantastic. Andre actually thinks he will win.
I’ll miss these
S/O Providence!
Good spent money on family byt dang nit one father smh We as blk men got to allways take care of are families ones we get somethin crazy!   But he still made good &  etter moves then most
This should be a easy fight for David. He has a cater made fight. Guy coming from a long layoff, smaller guy. Moving up weight and has struggled with mediocre guys like Liam Williams who got beat by Liam smith. And drop by a late replacement Nicholson.  It’s a joke anyone thinks Andrade can win.  Andrade pulls this off completely destroys David career and any chances of ever being considered a great. Most likely David comes over weight and Andrade gets stopped by the 9. If Andrade has any chance of winning. Is taking advantage of the slow flat footed plodding style of David. Stay off the ropes and circles while jabbing and just in and out.  Just a perfect fight and not get pulled into a brawl.
Thanksgiving 4 day weekend off from work girl is going to her parents for the holiday man early x mas gift for me the fight ❤
Why cant we get 6 or 8 episodes of all access just charlo and davids brother would have crazy ratings with the drama showtime is done with boxing so give the fans some episodes to watch leading up to the fight
I’m tired of hearing the same sad stories  I hope these two brothers lose on Saturday  They are flat footed
“ I can’t die, my boo-boo bout to have my baby”
That BBL lol
CAN'T WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
“It’s me again “ !!!
Lets go MEXICAN MONSTER
Barrera and Marquez hate canelo so much they kiss Benavides ass. Pathetic. So dang obvious.
What's the name of the song at 3:00?
Has Andrade pulled out yet or been popped for roids ??? It’s fight week lol u know the routine with this joke
Meh...
17:57 mane I feel this so much.
Marques, estamos peliando para que canelo pelie conmigo  ya mamasela, jaja 🤣
This was extremely motivating in all levels, father and son , work harder,  it's never the end, pain is love ,  probably the best Showtime has done , shit is my 3rd time watching it lol
No respect for Benavides until he fights a good boxer his own size..
It's easier when you weight 30 pounds more than your opponent on fight night, For sure .
where in the world is part 2? one of the biggest fights of the year and PBC/Showtime drops the ball yet again!
Bandera roja all the way lest go benavides
Bandera roja all the way lest go benavides
Bandera roja all the way lest go benavides
These other races in sports love rocking African braids.
God bless BOTH families, I respect men who stand up & raise their children..  With that said I have The Mexican Monster knocking out Demetrius "boo boo" Andrade..   2023 is a GREAT year for boxing, let's go baby..   lol..
I hate to admit it. Boxing is dieng RIP showtime
Barreras &:Marquez, in your corner?!...DAAAAAYYYYYYUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM😮
Marquez is a complete Canelo hater
SOOOO PBC IS STIL POUND 4 POUND🤣
This is a Mega interesting fight. Both fighters ducked by the elite of the sport. IT’S TIME FOR BOTH OF THEM!!!
YALL STILL AINT DROPPED PART 2 ?!?! 🤦🏾😭
Lets goooo fightinggggg
David will overwhelm boobo ko or tko inside 8 rounds
Davy B next fight needs to be whom ever gave his bride that BBL!!  🤕
That brotherly love was just amazing. I really wanna see Jose Benavidez win.
Man... I love Andrade, i had so much expectations for him but I'll never forget how he ducked Janibeck.
Benavidez is an outstanding fighter
The build up to Him and Canelo is gonna be wild
Кашан болат бокс
Andrade kinda looks like Robert Downey jr in tropic thunder 😂
only one Ep??
This fight will be a let down not because of David but because Andrade will get on his bike and run!!
2:56 what is the name of this song?
Canelo aint trying to see neither one😅
Showtime boxing is supposedly quitting. Putting fights on PPV like this shows that is well deserved.
“El Menchooooo! da mosnta”
Hey ShowTime! It is un-American to stop broadcasting boxing.  🇺🇸  Shame!  😡   I’m switching to Cinemax.
Davids gonna be too much 4 Booboo. Late KO. 🥊🇲🇽
I’m going for Benavidez but don’t sleep on Andrade he’s a beast! This is what boxing needs more of! The best vs the best
Daaaamn, yall taking FOREVER to give us part 2. DROP THAT MF!!! 😹😹😹
Where’s part 2?
I got boo boo
In CANELO words "GAt tha Fucka outta  Hare" 😂😂😂😂😂
ALL winners in my opinion. Fathers and their Sons!!!! These are all my favz
Floydmayweather Jr sign showtime. Showtime get elevated. HBO boxing out of business. I definitely miss showtime boxing
Keep repoin PHX DAVID. we behind you.
You may be a good fighter but you are sharp as a bowling ball
Son tan buenos boxeadores que ninguno merece perder .
Benavides is going down
51 49 benavidez. 2 to 1 fav.
Jermall going KO jose
I will never lose to a man called "Boo Boo"
Do not be fooled. David Benavidez is not Mexican. He has a Mexican-American father with an Ecuatorian mother. Born and raised in the US. I do not appreciate when media takes advantage of his hispanic heritage and grant him a fake identity.
I see Andred upsetting Benabidez
Boo Boo seems so excited and ready I can’t wait to watch this fight
Pbc & Showtime Robbed countless Mexican fighters and ruined their careers with their racist agenda
GOOD RIDDANCE PBC/SHOWTIME! 👏 😊😊😊😊
Blacks motivation is to steal the fight from Benevidez due to the fact that they're still butthurt when Andrade was clowned by Canelo as a Horrible fighter, and they want all their hype job  black fighters to get rich off Canelo and Mexican fan base money 💵
Did he said David is el Mencho?
Respect to these guys. The best must fight the best it’s the only way to say who’s the elite fighters. Just cuz u lost to a top guy don’t mean u not a top guy! Let’s go fellas.
Leave the wild animals in the wild, dammit!
Hi...how is the song of 2:55 time? Thanks for comments.
How you still not have the smoke detector fixed???
Showtime do the best episodes by far !
2 eek camp was tough..
No matter what happens, I have huge respect for Andrade. He accepted fight with ease, I think he would even accept 90-10 split just to fight. I think Benavides himself realised that and that's why he respects him. Cause Andrade is not about money, he just wants to fight best. I think Andrade would fight Canelo for free. You just have to respect how resolute he is...
Lmao im not sure some neighbors down the street trippin i guess
Canelo lives rent free in Juan Manuel Marquez mind😂
TEAM BENAVIDEZ ALLDAY👊👊👊
David's gonna whip that man's ass!!
Andrade could do it , this is an awesome fight! Tune in
David Benevidez has grown on me these last few fights. He has that grit and loves when a fight breaks out.
Yeah im sorry but he’s beating the dog shit outta andrade. Benavides too relentless. He’ll walk through anything that dude has
Part 2?!
I can't stand the dad lmao
Fire that they are brothers and spare together 💪🏾🖤
I have a feeling this fight will be a nice slugfest. Lets see if they both walk the walk. Andrade doing a whole lot of talking. Lets hope.
Benavidez is a beast... Andrade is a talent like no other ..but the Canelo hate is getting crazy... Canelos a small ass MW and Benavidez is 175er easy...theyre going to fight but to act like Canelo isnt a generational talent is crazy.
I’m from Phoenix, I know Benavides’s heart. Andrade is about to get destroyed.
Hats off to David for fighting a man everyone else ducks 😊 My money on Boo Boo 🎊 🎉
Demetrius is the better boxer, but benavidez is bigger and stronger. I can see these playing out like the plant fight.
I miss 24/7.
Boo boo is going to boo boo on himself
David is misguided and has the wrong motivation it will be short lived .
Wow Both Guys I admire, it will be a great fight sad one has to lose. Not like MMA a loss in boxing really effects market ability. no real reason as styles make fights all real boxing experts know this .
Who does everyone have on this one
Benevidez's wife's got a fat dumpster
Demetrius Andrade has been in a permanent state of prospect. Kind of like Boots and Ortiz are right now.
Easy win for benavides
Benavides all day.
That moment when the father opened up with both Benavides brothers was a very special moment. It takes a lot for someone to admit they were wrong
I just don’t think boo boo is serious. He’s going to lose convincingly…
Arriba el Canelo🔥🔥💪!
Only 1 Benavidez winning on the 25th
BooBoo been fighting DooDoo fighters. We’ll finally see if he’s the real deal
Excited for This fight Andrade called out Canelo years ago talking about Pay day etc but imo Benavidez is putting Andrade to sleep
Show Time is the best boxing i can’t do it with these other guys !
As good as the editing is, I’m still not invested in this fight, and I think it’s because of David
Benavidez is wild.
HBO gone next showtime rip y’all will never be forgotten 🥊💪❤️🌏
What is the song playing at the end?
Estamos en tu esquina carnal!!! Respect to both fighters!!! Gonna be a great fight!!
Fk man 1st hbo quits now showtime
David DIDN'T HURT Caleb the way CANELO DID!!... STRAIGHT UP
Boo- Boo That Beast is going to sit Benavidez down. Fo' Show👌💵💵💵💵😉😜🤑
People are starting to believe benavidez
David is a clown if he thinks hes beating canelo and as for this fight its kinda lame i feel like Benavidez picked an easy safe fight
Unfortunately, when u give a man an opportunity, he has been starved of  for years and does not end well for the other guy. Boo boo has the skill and stamina to be elusive for 20 rounds at top speed along with picking off David's weaknesses in defense. David will bounce back am Charlo will be next.
Andre tells great stories can't wait to see him commentary when he retires
日本だとリアタイでの配信が無いから死ぬほど残念過ぎる😢
The only fake thing in this reel is the wifeys 🍑. 😂
Yo this fight is gonna be amazing
💯🥊
Que ardido se escucho Juan manuel marqués
Canelo fights Benavidez on his 3rd fight of the contract and hands down the torch to David. Remember this comment.
I appreciate the fact that they're not talking all kinds of shit to hype the fight. No need for that bullshit. Leave that to ufc or wwe. Just keep quiet and get in there and fight. Nice on both sides. Winner will give a good fight to Canelo. No predictions from me.
Another Uber driver
i hope his boxing is beter then his jokes🤣
he wanted the ca$hnelo stimulous check thou🤣
Both a joke tbh I ain’t paying for this fight 🤷‍♂️
Booboo talk like a skateboarder and a stoner 😂😂
This is gonna be a good fight.
🥊💯🥊
This bro is animated! what did he say at 14:05? Lol
25th can’t come soon enough…
I got benavidez by stoppage, Andrade has a nice record but they were all bums including some homeless tomato 🍅 cans found under a bridge
This will be an interesting fight for boxing enthusiasts. Definitely buying this fight.
Boo Boo creating his own unique boxing style a la Bruce Lee.
Boo Boo all day !!! let's go Providence  Rhode Island the true Ocean State
David is gonna fuck this guy up 😂
This ain’t even the real All Access, Demetrius Andrade got dreads now 🤨
Vamos Benavidez con todo carnal.
.
I’m happy for both of these fighters they keep boxing exciting tbh
I'm GOING FOR BOO BOO...AND I'M NOT CALLING IT AN UPSET!! EITHER.. JUST LIKE BUD HAD THAT DOG AND SKILLS AND HEART TO HIT HIS BROTHER WITH THAT 1ST "L'" BOO BOO HAS ALL THE TOOLS TO BREAK AN "L" OFF ON DAVID.... I EXPECTED BUD TO BE JOSE, AND I ALSO  EXPECT BOO BOO TO DO THE SAME TO DAVID...
50-50.
Bro why does showtime boxing have to die it’s not right boxing will not be the same
Go cabo verde 🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻 ANDRADE
CABO VERDE🇨🇻 checking in!
Both brothers will sadly loose
I don’t understand how fans think Benavides is gonna win easy. Andrade is  a 10 for 10 fighter
Both girlfriends got diaper butts 🤣
This dude whoever he is can't even pronounce his own last name, Monster by KO.
I know there are a few boxing fans who think Andrade has fought nobody. But this guy got skills. This could be a potential banana peel for benavidez. Full credit for benavidez though for taking this fight. High risk low reward. Andrade doesn’t sell many ppvs, and is a dangerous fight.
Benevidez will make this look easy...
Benevidez son is an adorable little champion, hope he's as badass as his dad when he grows up.   Good luck champ and let me pre congradulate you on your win.
Andrade fight nobody
Can’t wait 🤙🤙
That cat looks like it's gonna rip someone's face off one day
Jose Benavidez Jr. trying not to laugh when his dad said I love you
Can’t wait for this fight. Hopefully it’s a good fight
He ain't fully Mexican , stop calling him the Mexican monster
Your no champ your joke.  Canelo is a champ.
Andrade has the sauce to run around the ring all night long that's the only sauce he has .
Everyone thinks they are ducked bec they are so good , not always the case , it's not always the boxers ducking them its the promoters , making fights just 4 money
I love Boo Boos spirit although I think he's out in the second half , or he loses by decision
He need to fight canelo ultra fight
Andre cool as dude but he about to get his ass whooped
Damn Showtime really gone smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Booboo looks too calm almost like there's a slight craziness to him don't sleep on either fighter
Seen David Benavidez in Renton Washington said wassup spoke to me respectful humble man. Keep grinding bruh 💯💯💯
Andrade so weird and different he might have a chance lol 😂😂😂
I can't see andrade winning more than two rounds.
Big David fan, but Canelo beats him on skill. No KO in that fight. Canelo wins by points.
This gonna be a good one 🥊🥊
Andrade "sho'll" is fine. 😫
Love to watch all access before the fights
Andrade is the seed of Gad making him a Gadite aka native American that is who the scripture speaks of being the warriors
Benavidez Bothers Ready ￼For Andrade And Charlo  November 25 2023 https://youtu.be/iNi0vjV6L44
Boo boo is a very good fighter Benavides has a hard fight !!!
The subtle diss from Barrera and Marquez towards Canelo, lol, Benavidez aint Mexican.
The 2 dawgs Canelo has been avoiding. You can say what you want, it’s an actual fact. But cinnamon won’t be able to run much longer….he’ll have to face one of these beasts.
Canelo didn’t treat Plant like that!
Benavidez is probably my favorite  boxer. I really hope we get to see Benavidez VS Alvarez.
Benavidez take care with the Boo Boo. Let’s see what happens. but Andrade has a lot of skills.
💪
Boo boo? 😂😂😂 zesty af. There’s levels to boxing. He gon find out
Bruh, that talk at the lake had my allergies acting up! That's what life is about right there!
As a Mexican-American, I’m proud to see David rising in boxing! He’s got heart and ambition to be one of the best ever. That Canelo fight is coming, Canelo can’t ignore him forever 🥊
Benavidez is clapping them cheeks
This niggas boxing with the fear 😂😂😂 who’s training him? Ricky Bobby’s dad 😂🤣
Ese Márquez está traumado con el Canelo jajaja.
Slow ass American benavidez lost to mich respect, after he couldn't even stop glass chin plant🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣🤣..  guy gonna struggle as hell once he moves up fiight equally sized boxers
This is gonna be a scarry fight. Im for Benavidez but Andrade is for real. Hes in it to win it. Either way ill be a fan for both after the fight. Go Benavidez.
If Benavidez beats Andrade after beating plant that just means that slick American style Boxing ain’t beating him which I already know. You gotta come forward with pressure and be able to trade counter punch him. (Canelo) if Andrade does that he’s getting laid out but that slick shit ain’t gunna work for him against benavidez. Morell won’t be able to do it either.
Andrade is too much of a clown never bet on clowns. Another AB
Lol but Shakur got a fight Thursday and nobody talking that’s real humbling 😂😂
Boo on that snac?? Uhoh better watch out he got the secret juice lol 😂
Andrade talking to much who wanna bet tapn
Please showtime don't pull an HBO on your subscribers!!
Andrade said “David ben-a-VDs”They struggle pronouncing last names or this is an inside joke that we’re not aware of.  😂😂😂😂
My money is on the brother
I support David Benavidez because he cuts through the bullsh*t...and also he's 1 day older than I am :)
Isn't @Benavidez Ecuadorian/Salvadoran 🤔⁉️
Andrade is an exceptional fighter, this is no walk in the park for Benavidez.
If boo boo is who he says he is he should win the fight
When this two fake goats fighting
This is not a fair fight.  David is fighting someone who is definitely on the spectrum.  Andrade has obvious brain damage
Boxing will keep going mfs with or without showtime.
is it me or am I the only person that caught David in the back gesturing money, when his dad was telling them he loved them?
I don't think Andrade stands a chance against the Mexican Muhammad Ali. Benavidez probably won't get hit much. Andrade probably needs to find a way to hit around that Rope-a-Dope by movement and swingin like Tyson's hooks when he goes into that style. I'm a real big Andrade fan, but he's about to meet his match.
Bivol the Mexican killer
Still can't believe this is a ppv event...
Childhood issues addressed...how is that going to affect his son's fights ? I think David looks incredibly motivated in his eyes to me.
I don't see Benavidez losing this fight. Andrade migth be a quite capable boxer, but It'd be a great upset should he beat Benavidez. Benavidez 90%.
Boo got this
You’re not Mexican understand that! Benavides !
Andrade the 35year old prospect 😂😂
I'll be watching Floyd cash flow Diaz
The legacy of the ancient Mexican warriors stills lives in every single fighting sport
Boo Boo is 🌽🌽🌽🌽
I CANT WAIT 🥊💯🔥💥
CANELO would steamroll Benavidez within 8-9 rounds, to be perfectly honest with you...
Andrade lowkey sounds like Shane Mosley when he talks lmao
Damn I kinda wanna watch this fight at 168 I think canelo still has them only one way to find out
All these Mexican ex-champions don't like Canelo Alvarez. Let me be clear. I am not a fan of Canelo, but he is THE BEST Champion Mexico has ever produced.
This black guy is going night night
But why her ass look like that 😂
BRUH! Benavidez can easily be p4p!!! If not ,i bet whoever they p4p is , they dont want to fight him.Just my opinion
Charlo doing the same B.S Canelo doing fighting the smaller brother 😂 easy win for Charlo just like for Canelo. Now Benavidez vs Andrade is real WAR!
🍑 🍑
👊😎👍 machin
This is going to be regarded as one of Benavidez classic fights. Expect a Canelo vs GGG 1 fight.
I like the respect given by both fighters to each other. Andrade gets a bad rep. Deserves his shot but its a tough fight for him. Benavidez Deserves credit also for taking such a tough and akward opponent. Looking forward to this one. May the best man win
Canelo haters showing out for David
30 minutes of them talking about canelo 😂
Why is showtime boxing going to end ?
🔥🔥
Im definitely going to miss this damn been watching showtime boxing for a long time
Pensé que era más grande de edad  26 años 😮 mucho futuro
Abarrera y amarquez apollan avenivides 😮 estodo
Que envidioso este Márquez, no se puede creer el rencor que le tiene a Canelo
Benavidez "The Blacky Slayer"
Get the fack outa here! You just want pay day pay day. I know
Benavidez needs to KO his old lady's doctor for that atrocious pamper butt!! Like 2 lollipops stuck together 🍭🍭            OO             | |
I’m miss showtime 😢
Andrade is a weird dude
LATINOS UNIDOS LATINOS THE "STRONGEST".... I agree with David "La Bandera Roja" Benavidez Every time he fights is a CLEAR Victory !! And this will be the result against Demetrius "BooBoo" Andrade. As I've, Mentioned in my previous comments. It's a 50/50 Showdown I do have respect for Andrade he is a well respected Champion. However, Benavidez has too much fire 🔥 Power and Unlimited Artillery in his boxing training and preparation. Benavidez's incredible Endurance and Stamina throws multiple combinations executions relentlessly NON STOP for an entire 12 rounds will be Overwhelming for Andrade and a force to be respected and reckoned with.  Benavidez will pressure Andrade breaking him down from the bottom up around by round into the Championship Rounds and finely Knock Andrade Out !! LET'S GO David "La Bandera Roja"🚩 Benavidez 🇺🇸🇲🇽👊💯 Greetings from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷👊💯
This is going  to be a tough fight for benavidez.  Andrade training with Victor the mad scientist Conte😂.  He got them dudes in mad shape!  David better be ready.
Boo boo is crazy
Wow!!!!
🥊 Undefeated vs Undefeated 🥊
Good fight
I would really love to see you fight beterbieve
I like this guy. He keeps it real and he puts the work in. I got respect for the MEXICAN MONSTER 😅
Their Dad reminds me of myself and how tough I was on my kids especially my Son because of the same reasons. We now have a fractured relationship which I regret everyday ( I used to take him to the gym and watch all his fights)... I hope one day I can make it up to him just like Sr done .... It takes a real man to admit their mistakes and apologize ... Go Benavidez !!
am sorry but boo boo sucks .. he has a hella weird boxing method and its not even a hard puncher .. hes gonna get demolished..
Needing a haircut after you get up from a haircut is crazy. Gon be a great fight tho.
David is easy to dislike. But you gotta love how much he loves his brother. His brother looked excellent coming up as a youngster. Then he got shot in the leg. After that, he could never move the same. Sad. But David still acts like he's going somewhere. The ride is lon over for Jr. It's just beginning for David. I don't see David losing for the next 6-7 years. Betting on David is like putting money in the bank.
Booboo getting the doodoo beat out of him.
IK DANNY GARCIA WISHES HIS POP LEARNED FROM HIS MISTAKES AND SHOWED HIM THE SAME LOVE DAVIDS POPS DID🥴
This show was fire 🔥
No one thinks it's weird we never got a Barrera vs Márquez rematch?
Dude, i would feel so special if i had the backing of all the Mexican greats 🇲🇽.
It's good that Showtime is leaving boxing.
Bubu bout to get beat like a piñata! Unfortunately so is Jose
Idek how many times I've watched this atp... 💀
Believe me when I say Benavides CANT go 12 rounds with the undisputed champ 🇲🇽
I thought that was brian ortega for a sec lol
Pbc ran it showtime..holding back too many good fights.. Espinoza was puppeteered by Haymon
Demetrius dont gas out the first 7 rounds. Cuz thats what benavides does. Let them gas out. The he starts working in then.  Have a good cardio!!!!
Que no se cance el Andrade. Benavides los deja que se cancen los primeros 7 rounds,  y luego los empieza trabajar...
Canelo better give Benavides his shot after this, no excuses after this
Train when I want to train David the Mexican monthter Benavides   And that's exactly why canelo is going to smoke him
Andrade is a corny dude,  who’s overly confident. He will be irrelevant soon.
Pay day vs pay day💀
Damn Benavides gonna look great
Let’s go ANDRADE!!!
You see David's speed at 17:17? Dude's a beast and fast for his size
I want to see Benavidez vs Morrel I was sick that fight didn’t materialize 🥹
I would not be surprised if boo boo does something here spectacular. If benrvidez can k.o him that will be crazy to me and he will become the Mexican monster😂
Márquez is a straight Canelo hater! He just can’t hide his hate for him. It’s sad my boy
😂😂😂 Jose stands Zero Chances With His Lil Brother 😂😂
Love seeing two brothers succeeding man 👏🏽 RESPECT
Andrade don’t even know how to pronounce his own last name …….. yeah he gone lose fs
Yeesss... Ini salah satu pertarungan yang sangat saya nantikan, ayo Benavides selesaikan ini dengan baik.. Benavides anda adalah salah satu petinju masa kini yang sangat menjual dan hebat..
ESPN or DAZN need to hire the all access Crew after showtime boxing leaves
Sexy mamasota
I really like the personalities of these 2 guys. Real dawgs. Real hungry. No nonsense. But you can tell they both love what they're doing. This fight is going to be fire. No doubt.
Lmao Marquez will take any chance he has to go against Canelo! 🤣
I like both these guys. Let the best men win 🏆
Did l miss something!? Are there any Mexicans on anyone's ALL TIME TOP 10 LIST !? Are Mexican's even a majority on today's top 10 P4P list!?Only 1 heavyweight champion only for him to lose the title on his 1st defense!And  since when are they even considered to be the best in boxing when did that happen did l miss something!?! Or are they trying to appease them into thinking they're good to sell tickets!? Cause everytime l see them fighting a  top African American fighters they lose like 70% of the time in big time fights!
Team Andrade!!!! Let’s get it!
Andrade is goofy, but in a likable way 😂
Both are overhyped……🥱
Big game, tough game but Benavidez uppercut will knockout andrade
Salty as Marquez of Canelo
Poor Andrade… after this fight he can go back to others sports
Todos son buenos hasta que canelo lo destruye
These mfs have an ocelot
Imagine going from being an awkward and angry little chubby kid to being known around the world as "The Mexican Monster" That's some comic book shit lol
Perfect way to start the show a nice round BBL
He ain't mexican  he ain't no monster... 😂😂😂
Much like vs plant size is Benevidez only genuine advantage
Benavidez to win☠️
This fight is going to be legendary. 32-0 Benivedez is in trouble.
Has Benavidez always trained in Seattle? Seems like an odd location
until proven otherwise Mr. Andrade looks and sound like he has the ability to upset the applecart.  boxing is the theater of the unexpected this may be a a fight that proves the statement to be true good luck to both men
This fight is a must see .. 💥
Megusta escucharlo ablar  Español  vinedidez el es Mexicano y gran campeon
😂 i feel sorry for Andrade
I can see them being good friends after the fight.
Canelo will beat both of them
Damn nobody gonna talk about that wild cat 🤣😳 shit!!
Beat ppl up and get paid😂😂😂😂
If Canelo wants to beat Benavidez his only chance is now if that.. if the monster gets 1-2 more fights like this Canelo won’t have a chance… he’ll end up just like Spence
David in trouble
When canelo beats Benavides they going to say canelo paid him or something,Andrade will take this one tho
I hope the next combination with pbc b good.. Bcuz this marriage pbc had with showtime was 🎉🎊🎉🔥🔥🔥😍💪🏾 Sad to say and see but r.i.p to showtime😩😔 They will b missed
I’m gonna miss All Access . It’s a basically a Rocky movie is 45 min
My prediction for this fight: 1 of 2  1. Benavidez by Decision or Robbery  2. Draw  Not to say I won’t be surprised if Andrade gets the win, but because how political boxing is and how these judges are, shit is really a toss up… BUT I COULD BE WRONG
I like Benavidez but i dont see him beating canelo 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ and i hate canelo
Bandera roja 🚩
Just my opinion david Benavidez is the next king of boxing his power is scary he is just reaching the beginning of his prime.. i dont see any boxers beating him no time soon!! The only person i think can, is himself only he can beat him.... Canelo better take note and watch out
Mexican legends just like to hate on Canelo….
Benevidez is going to KO this dude 🤦🏻‍♂️
Glad to see Andrade get an opportunity, he earned it. This is going to be a great fight.
Andrade is the mike spinks of this class... awkward as hell , off beat when punching...mhe jUst might have a chance,IF ANYTHING he'll make him look bad in victory. BooBoo do your thing for the monster comes
They’re gonna get rid of that cat soon those cats ain’t no joke and I doubt they can handle it😂
These two benavidez brothers have been boxing top guys and putting good fights glad to see them still together and on the same card
When Canelo fights Benavdez, you'll see how much David shells up. He's going to look like Charlo and Plant. Benavidez throws 50+ punches a round, when he only throws 19 or less in a round please recognize it's because he's scared of CANELO'S counter. Big bad wolf will disappear and he'll cover up. He'll get KO'd if he decides to throw. He's a basic fighter with no foot work. NO EXCUSES when David loses. It's not the best fighting the best when David never did what CANELO did in the division. David has never UNIFIED. He's not good, He's a PBC fighter.  Look at how Thurman lost to an old Packman. Spence lost to Crawford. Plant lost to Canelo. Charlo looked horrible against Canelo. David will be the same.  David is not on Canelo's level. He couldn't even KO plant and he's the "mexican monster". GTFOH. It's annoying how you ppl don't get it. Canelo has NEVER been on the canvas and he's fought guys bigger than him majority of his career. David on the other hand is always the bigger fighter and has been knocked down before. PUT YOUR $$$$ where your mouth is when the fight happens and show proof of your belief in David with a legit bet on David beating Canelo. Screen shot it or post a pic of the ticket. I highly doubt that you will. -THATS TO ALL THE DAVID FAN BOIS

The last hoorah for ShoSports 🥊🥊🥊😖😖😖😖😖Mexican Monster, BooBoo…. Puncher, Boxer … Lets get it on man !!!
victor couldn't miss his time on camera
Benavidez has never unified. Andrade has never unified. Seems like it's going to be a boring fight. DOO DOO will run the whole fight and probably not throw many punches besides a looping hook. BORING!!!
Ok dad clout chasing you wait for camera to say i love you both it was hard when you were young ok dad fake as hell  Come on andrade
Why do women do that? 🤢 It looks abnormal and disgusting. Y'all all wanna be Kim K. or something?? Yikes.
it should be Benavidez brothers vs Charlo brothers on the same night.
Finally !
I’m more excited for this fight than I am excited for Thanksgiving
Beautiful!!!!!!!!!
Would love to see how Charlo is preparing for the fight too though. Great stuff I am seeing from Boo Boo, Benevidez has his work cut out for him.
Benavidez has the highest total connect percentage in boxing at 38.9 percent, because he is relentless in his attack. He punishes his opponents with blistering combinations, breaking them down round by round until, ultimately, they give out. This is only Andrade’s second match at 168 pounds, Benavidez could test his chin and put him on the canvas if he timely counters him. Vanes Martirosyan  was able to drop Andrade with a left hook back in 2013 at 154 pounds. Monster in 6
To defeat DB one should have great power, be highly elusive or have great timing or good mix of all three. Thats how you can neutralize or slow down DB. DA gets sloppy at times which deplete his energy and create little power. From the video clips DA doesn't seem really focused. I think DB is fragile specially in the body, but constant pressure just doesn't let his opponents hurt him. I believe that a good strategy for DA would be in first few rounds put a lot of pressure and target the body with the mentality either KO or get KO'd. Because as the fight progresses DA's chance to win will get slimmer. That's how I see him winning. To be realistic I think DB will KO him, but I am definitely rooting for DA.
I got Boo-boo. Love what Benavides is doing here. Good luck to both fighters
🧡
nothing was like hbo
Benavidez🤣🤣🤣 u a clown And u wana fight canelo
David round 8 👀 come back and check 😂😂🙄
The snac program!
Trilogy in the making‼️🥊🥊🥊
Jose will spend most of his time snarling at Jermall and then getting hit.
WEAK !!!’
This gonna be a good fight
It’s showtime
Nothing can beat showtime boxing
Benavides wife and I are gonna live it up in Miami with half of his come .
I am nervous about this fight. I am a Benavidez fan but man people sleep on Andrade and i hope david doesn't because Demetrius is real deal . Hope David pulls it
Be careful with manuel  don’t fight for no ex boxer dog fight for yourself and your family your the biggest thing after canelo but stay hungry bro don’t stop give all this dudes war
Bro you a good boxer there’s no doubt about it,but I think you have to wait before you encounter canelo wait don’t rush nothing you’re time will come
benaburgers aint no canelo killer
Canelo’s success keeps Marquez up all night!! 😂
Come back to this comment when Benavidez stops Doo Doo Andrade.
Benavides is gonna get fucked uuup!! Andrade will KO the Mexican monster !
Mrs Benavidez 🍑
Juan Manuel Marquez omg big game Canelo hater!! Shhhh this dude it's a joke foreals
Shocked but not shocked by how many people actually checked for this. Assuming because it’s the last one
These 2 brothers will have a hard time with some one that has foot work and moves around the ring.
Canelo finished Plant  Benavidez couldnt finish Plant
Wife got that butter face
All Access < Embedded
I like this matchup. I wouldn’t mind seeing the winner face Zurdo Ramirez before a Canelo showdown.
Too small for Benavidez..will give it a go while it lasts...will end by being walked down like a  caged animal...if of course he doesn't have the power to keep him off.
What type of cat was that
Benavidez is going to KO this dude I know it
Thank you all access crew for the many years of great fighter stories
With these clowns no no wonder Showtime is leaving boxing,  a "sport" where everything is rigged
It seems like the Mexican Greats don't really rock with Canelo
BooBoo been waiting for a big fight for almost 10 years too bad its showtime last big fight
The saltiness of Barrera and Marquez to be in benevidez corner because they hate that canelo is greater than them is so funny to me 😂
canelo already is running out
Can't wait for this boxing card man...
Also all access start collating with other companies because I want shakur on here and Devin
Benavidez is just too good too elite at his weight class
Marquez is envious of Canelo. He just can't get past Canelo's super wealth! Canelo will knock out the curls out of Benavidez!
Are they half brothers
People this guy he can fight that's for sure it wouldn't give me my opportunity and a lot of people ducting Keith Thurman got his ass whooped by him in practice great fight
Why do they have too do away with these vidoes 😔man these are always so enjoyable like an end off an era😭😭😭😭😭
I don't think brothers should be sparring hard . Not striking .
This is such a heartfelt episode! Hope both brothers win their fights!
He said nicaragua
Demetrius Android
You don’t say your brother gonna shock the world. You hold him higher to that
funny how he gets respect from all the legends but the fans hating in him like little chismosas😂
RIP SHOWTIME
I just hope Demetrius hasn't left it too late to make this step up. The guy has had a rough time, so wish him all the best. Think he is a better all round Boxer than Benavidez
Now David’s little boy can say he started at 2 year’s old and no one gave him a chance and he had to earn everything 😂
The 35 year old prospect 😂😂😂😂😂
Andrade is one goofy ass dude.
it's already been such a great year for boxing, but I dunno man I just have a feeling about this fight. I think it's gonna turn out to be a barn burner.
that BBL is crazy
"I give david a run for his money" Jose is big cappn lol
Marquez is a crying lil baby 😂😂😂😂
Hopefully we get to see an All Access between Canelo vs Benavidez before they’re gone🥲
This guys are way to big to be fighting at 168..i bet they have at least 190 on a regular day ...
Benavidez needs a hair cut PRONTO!
I feel like the dads speech should have been private for him and his boys because it just makes it look like its for the camera
I’m Puertorican and BENAVIDES is my favorite boxer together with SHAKUR STEVENSON !🥊
Andrade bout to get mopped
Amazing this is one of the best previews ever. Both Benavidez brothers. Behind the scenes w/ their kids n entire family. Love to see it! I also like how D.A. keeps calling David, BENA-VEE-DEEZ lmao
Benavides is the diva
Best show on TV
Love Marquez telling he damn near got no choice to fight canelo😂
David is going to kill him
this is actually a really good fight cos i have no idea who wins. i see benavidez by controversial decision. i also see it doing about 60k ppv buys
Booboo already rolled over for Benavidez, too passive. He's just there for a check. His demeanor reminds me of Charlo vs Canelo.. Just happy to be there and get paid.
Andrade is getting the W, mark my words. Both Benevides bros are losing.
I’ve got to be honest, BooBoo is growing on me. Seems like a pretty cool dude to be around
Dude that got his gloves signed by Andrade look like they asked him to do that shit 😂
Man first it was HBO, now it’s showtime
I like this video
THATS A GREAT DAD RESPECT BENERVIDEZ
THE BENERVIDEZ FAMILY IS SIMILAR TO THE SMITH FAMILY IN LIVERPOOL ENGLAND FAMILY OF FIGHTERS WHO BOXED EACH OTHER FRIM DAY 1 WITH SLIPPERS ON HANDS  RESPECT GOD BLESS YOU ALL
Marquez is a str8 Canelo hater...
Canelo at 23 was fighting legends.  Haney shakur charlos benavidez boo boo tank no one else compares to Canelo
THERES NO WORLD TITLE  CANELO HOLDS ALL THE BELTS  A INTERIM OR SILVER TITLE ISN'T A TITLE.  BUT A GREAT FIGHT FOR SURE  ILL BE WATCHING
Just hope you don't take him lightly cause if you do and he ain't injured you'll lose on points
When Marquez and Barrera got your back instead of canelo, you made it🔥👌🏽
I can’t see Andrade winning. He has no pocket in fighting and when his legs give and he can’t run it’s over.
Andrade is a dangerous fighter as well, only mistake he does is, dropping his guard down when brawling. Can't do that in championship fight.
Does Andrade have heart we’re going to find out if he’s coming to win and FIGHT.
Boo-boo backing up is the wrong game plan I’m telling you right now. If he don’t go out there and take it to David he’s going to get his ass drilled up.
Two fighters that ACTUALLY COME TO FIGHT, I’m excited for this one.✅
Love the guy, but had to skip away when they showed his wife. Way too much plastic
Andrade is going to Box circles  around Benavides and school the shit out of him.....but im afraid these freaking crooked ass judges are going to Steal the fight for Benavides! They dont want Benavides taking a loss.  ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY YALL And there's more money to be made with a Undefeated 26 year old  Benavides....than there is with a Undefeated 36 year old Andrade   They want that Canelo vs Benavides Fight more than they want the Andrade vs Canelo.  Both of those fights would be legendary cause both Andrade and Benavides are the only Fighters that will definitely Beat Canelo...and thats why Canelo is afraid to Fight Them!
Andrade is the class joker, in His mind, But everyone else thinks He is the joke.
I think it's unwise for Canelo to fight David. Canelo would not win a single round, and I dare say he would be knocked out.
I love both guys. Let the best man win. Both very avoided
Can someone tell me why Hispanics refuse to change their smoke detector batteries?
bro isnt even mexican wtf
I like Benavidez and follow Him as a Mexican boxing fan. but I don't like that nick name Monster He did KO Plant.
I really like them both. Benavidez is serious and you can see is focused. Andrade is quite a character. He has a very peculiar personality. But they both want this victory. The biggest fight in the division right now!
The best man will win for sure
Boo Boo is Doo Doo
Proven dope head
Look stop it go to heavyweight thats what you really are
R.I.P boo boo 🥶👀
Shit boy his girlfriend has The BBL done paid for from Hubby
🇲🇽Canelo Vs Benavidez 🇪🇨 ..
Top notch quality
Andre is gonna get hammered by the Mexican monster
Pretty much guaranteed to be an entertaining fight. We as boxing fans should respect whoever loses. As long as they put up a trying effort that’s all that matters.
All Access is the best, going to suck when its gone.
For all the people with a hand in making these for so many fights over the years, thank you! Although Showtime Boxing is going away, these All Access shows will continue living in legacy. I can honestly say, that this is one of the best running sports productions of all time, I am grateful to have seen so many of them. Again, Thank You all, and best of luck to whatever comes next.
Mike tyson is a sellout..he love kissing Mexican fighters AZZ
Canelo no le urJe peliar conbenabides por eso es el meJor 👍🇳🇪
I like David when he said he was Mexican but then he started saying he was part Dirty dog from south of my Mexico so I going for BoBo
David with a TKO stoppage in the 9th.  Or KO in the 10th.
Let’s go!!! Excited for this one
The Benavides  family are real, God bless them, I see the love blessing ya.
Andrade i dont see you will avoid benavidez hooks the one that his elbow is at 90 degree angle because you dont use footwork and angles
🤫DAVID IS GONNA LEARN SO MUCH IN THIS LOSS TO ANDRADE, HE WILL APPLY THE TOOLS HE LEARNS FROM A BLK FIGHTER LIKE CANELO AND GO ON TO GREATNESS, THE MONSTER IS YOUNG HOPEFULLY POPS STOPS THE FIGHT IF HE IS TAKEN TOO MUCH DAMAGE FROM ANDRADE, AND BOUNCES BACK TO GREATNESS
All Access Or Hard knocks?
PBC Might go to Netflix.... will miss showtime. If true hopefully Netflix will take boxing to the top. Top 3 or 4th  sport in the world... Soccer Football Boxing Basketball. Might have to go back to Friday and Saturday. Something
David is a bit slow and reckless sometimes. a good counter puncher and smart fighter will knock him out
Why’s this dork wearing shades while he’s training?? 😂
I really don't think BooBoo has enough power to make Benevidez respect him so that Micheal Myers stalking will never stop!
Showtime please don't go away
Why did it feel like Andrade was trying to convince himself that he could win while he was talking lol
MUCH RESPECT TO BOTH FIGHTERS. THEYRE BOTH GREAT FIGHTERS WHO’ve been ducked for years.
i love when jose benevides said david was destined for greatness and david had to hype him and say we both are because it seems jose believes david is gonna overshadow him by a lot
So glad boxing is dying. I'm sick of this sport trash fights, no big fights, top names fighting random people from different weight classes. This what you get when you dont hold a sport accountable. MMA is king.
No one does it like showtime 🔥🥊
I'm going to miss this when showtime Boxing is gone
This was boring af
That girl is a no no...f that
I got Andrade over all them dudes, we just gota see the fights.
David what 3 titles you have? Canelo have all the real belts too many belts in boxing
showtime going where we gonna content like this
Boo boo is a rich man’s Blair Cobb 😂.  All kidding aside, this is gonna be a good test for both foghters
I dont even think this fight is gonna be close to be honest. Im a fan of Booboo and his way of fighting but sadly if Benavidez puts the pressure on Booboo I cant see it going the distance. Most likely will stop him late on oh a big UD
Let's go boo boo!!!  I know you are facing a giant but you the only one in this division who can pull this off.
I wonder where PBC is gonna go to next? I know it's somewhere fire. Like Fox Sports
Marquez can root for whoever but sad he rooting out of jealousy of canelo  not becuz he a fan of david we know what time it is he so jealous it pathetic 😂😂
That was dope!
the HOPE of the haters of CANELO IN ALL ACCESS.........he is waiting for the winner ........5 years ago
Canelo should of never fought Mayweather..that was obviously a money thing and Mayweather lured him in to take away his 0...Canelo should of never fought Bivol..he was to big..out his weight  ..class..Benavidez will destroy Andrade like nothing to it..then Benavidez just might be victim to the money fix fight ..take the loss for high pay..retirement money...Mayweather can fix any fighters mind...
That cat had both claws down already when that pro boxer realized he was being slapped. He almost got out of his fight there.
Barrera and marquez! Oh man thats fire
Benavidez has not defeated to anyone
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🫡
Y’all need to show out for showtime they better not leave us they do the best job with these inside peeks
The Mexican bone crusher
Benavidez putting on for the valley!!! 602 love! ☀️
This is the last All Access 😢
Andre is a corn ball dude is annoying af
He don’t even embrace Mexican monster Canelo should take that title too 😅
No tengo nada en contra de este chico al contrario se me hace un buen boxeador... Pero.... Como kiere conectar con la afición más noble y grande de el mundo.. Qe es la mexicana!! Y mejorar su afición sea más grande y con ello más ingresos como... Si La de México habla español obviamente... Y ellos siempre hablan inglés, y no hablan español y lo saben parlar... Y no kieren usarlo más qe una rara vez, y así kieren conectar con la afición de México...??  Je es imposible, para eso necesitarían usar el español y así conectar con ellos... Pienso yo que van más a la afición pocha o chicana qe ala mexicana... Es hay donde se equivocan... Esos no dan la misma apoyo y rentabilidad económica qe la afición MEXICANA es la más grande de el mundo, por eso a pesar canelo para mi no es de los mejores de el mundo, pero reditua mucho dinero a su favor, por que a pesar sabe ya algo de inglés, sigue usando en estos all acces.. Su español. Y la afición lo agradece y se siente orgullosa.  Canelo para lastima de el flecha roja, es el tapatío el real monstruo mexicano, el es el monstruo chicano... De una afición más pequeña sinceramente. Por eso no tiene el mismo impulso qe canelo mientras no analice qe así jamas conectará con esa afición tan bella como la de México si en realidad solo usan la bandera pero no la sienten así de simple y eso se ve se siente y mientras sea así, y vea ese será su gran error. Benavides es el monstruo chicano, no el MEXICANO.
easy fight for David
Benavidez he ain't Mexican
My prediction is one of these two guys is going to win
Still don't understand why showtime is done with boxing must not be making any money.
(It’s Me Again!) Boo Boo will punch in between His Combos! What no one done yet. David is defenseless when he throw his combos so his greatest skill is also his cryptonite. David is real good if he could win he is great period. The winner is surely the next king in 168 period.
When you hear the stove starting like that u know right away is the Mexican boxer
Benavidez will be the new face of boxing. Canelo fights are borning as FU#K‼️
This is a damn good fight, should be very close fight.
This was epic 🔥
Benavidez gonna really hurt this goofball! 😂
A cheetah 🐆 wtf ? 😂
Dam I’m excited!
Get ready for Benavidez vs Canelo next year if he gets passed Andrade
Their is only one Winners in this boxing matches now and it's Mexican boxers from Julio Caesar Chavez,to Oscar dela Hoya,David Beanavidez,and of course the King of boxing and one of the greatest of all time Saul Canelo Alvarez we dominating this sport like almost every other spot now that's what it is and David beanavidez will come out winning and knocking this Fugly weak and doping black dirty fighter andrade cause he ain't even a World champion at all just a mediocre type fighter that's it he ain't even that good just okay so David beanavidez is gonna school this poor fighter that he is cause black fighters dont punch that good or have a unique type of style like we do,like were born and taught y que Viva Mexico!!!! I know you people's will hate will always hate no matter what now is our time to shine in sports Asi es.
🇲🇽
andrade is the most feared and avoided boxer by canelo and crawford
Benavidez for the Win
Benavidez is the truth
I wish David had that stardom presence he jus doesn’t.😔
How can showtime give up boxing that shit crazy
Andrade look good with no names but now he’s fighting a real fighter theres levels to this game and he made a big jump and he’s gunna see why he didn’t belong in there with canelo
Damn they really had to fuck up boo boos edge up at the end on all acess why
canelita alvarez is a little girl.
One of the greatest fights 🥊
Why do they keep call someone Born in Arizona a Mexican?
Hopefully yall boy boo boo aint all talk thia is the time to show us all how great you are ive been waiting for thia moment for years lets see
I’m watching this on the superbox not worth paying for it
Thank you to both champs for making this happen.  🙏  God bless both champs .  I do think  Benavidez is too big . So will you see the same as Canelo vs Charlo.
Benavidez move out of Az?
Sad to see JMM be such a hater, he don’t like Canelo so says he is rooting for benavidez lol
nice video
Andrade is no joke but benavidez will break him down especially with body shots,benavidez by 10th rd stoppage
Dammmmm those Benavides women 🍑
Let's go benavidez,support from australia mate 👍 👏
IT was cool seeing bererra doing the interview .. he looks sharp
Im a Canelo fan to the max but I’ve been made a fan of Andrade. He’s very likable
Family is very important and the Benavidez clan are a good example of how families and teams who stick together will always prosper. Lets not forget BoBo, nicest guy. I wish them both well, may the best man win.🤗
The best fighting the best !!
This dude is NOT Full Mexican so don’t call him the Mexican monster. Not Mexican
I have been waiting for this fight
Sad showtime leaving … all these other platforms , ufc ,dazn and top rank followed their blueprint with these all access episodes and it’s crazy how Oscar glad they gon but this is who laid the foundation for things now
Prospect vs prospect, should be good. Not ppv good tho...
Props to Andrade for sacrificing himself for the beat down he’s gonna get
Honestly if Canelo does not fight the winner the boxing commission should strip him just how they did Crawford..Yes Canelo is the face and I believe they will not do nothing to him if he does not take the fight. But fair is fair
Andrade has been inactive for about as long as a damn charlo!
The fight boxing fans never knew they needed, but got it without years of "build up." No matter how this scrap plays out, credit to both guys for giving us a night to look forward to!
Gonna be a war
the cat, is that Stryker?
Lol Andrade a crazy goofy mf for real but you can tell he's a throwback fighter and a real champ, can't wait for this fight props to both of em
Horrible fighter, horrible
Dont take nothin from Andrade anybody jump the ring with Benavides gotta give them they respect. Reality is he had no choice but to take this fight he 35. He will try to out box David but pressure bust pipes !
I'm not even hyped for this fight lmfao 😂😂😂 bo bo sucks fought nobody's till now
Doo Doo is so ass idk why they hype him up 😂😂
Marquez is still hating on canelo he following a agenda
Where is the Ecuatorian mom? hope to see her on the fight the 25
This gonna be 🔥  Let's get it
The real Mexican Hall of Famers outta of Mexico have no respect for Canelo and all of the ducking tactics.
People pretend that Plant’s bloody face was from punches… it was a head clash! Other than that he had a scratch under his eye. 🎪 🎪 🎪
This is gonna be a great fight
nice video
❤❤❤ https://youtu.be/SNmNpFZMfUc?si=pyoyylNY_i3R1meL
💯😎Show Time been the best network consistently for yrs
David is getting dropped
If Andrade loses, I'd like to see him go against Plant next.
All access will be gone but Benavidez girl will always have all that plastic 😂
BENAVIDEZ 💯💯💯🇲🇽
Who ever wins this it better be canelos next opponent on May or September please make it happen daina white
Let’s go Andrade 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 , Mexico 🇲🇽 rooting for Boo Boo Andrade 😀😀
Andrade and Benavides are both likeable fighters, great personalities and abilities, rooting for both, may the best man win!
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Let the best man win! I like them both ! I’ve been following the career of theses two young avoided  warriors, and it’s been amazing!Now we get to see both of them share the ring can’t wait!
🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻 ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
The one fight i wouldn't wanna bet on. It's gonna be fuego 🔥
Not the biggest Andrade fan but he a likable dude
Not the biggest Andrade fan but he a likable dude
Really gon miss all access 🥲
viva ecudaor
Beautiful moment between the male benavidez family by the water
Benavidez the real n only mexican fighter that represents  Mexico,..
https://youtube.com/@exfordthedirector?si=ohMKEECpNghBSxLw
Thank both corners for giving us true fans this fight. The true warriors of the sport don't doubt themselves and fight the best to be one day the best. The styles are going to make this fight a really good fight. I can't wait.
Jeez, I just can,t wait for this fight, i am not going to  sit on the fence, i think that Andrade,s boxing skills are a little bit better than Benavidez, especially defensively, but Benavidez, jeez, he has what can only be described as "FREAK power", & very, good stamina, i,m going for a late stoppage for Benavidez, he might even have to get off the canvas, but he is really, really going  to have  go  to war to get the win.
Showtime all access was the best. I always liked showtime boxing way more than DAZN since it reminded me so much of HBO. Sad to see it getting shut down
Benavidez 💯💯💯
I don't get y people steady call Boo Boo (An-dra-dee) when he himself pronounces his name (An-drade)
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Andrade is gonna get pieced up.  And he is corny AF.
Crazy to think all access like hbo 24/7 gonezo
You can tell David was going easy on Jose 😂
I got Jose and I got boo boo! Night of the upsets.
Arriba mi Raza Finiquera!!!!
Can't wait, should be a great fight
Glad Andrade finally getting a shot, hate it’s against Benevedez! Andrade is a slick left handed boxer puncher vs Benevedez volume puncher with heavy hands! Love the matchup, winner is great! We going to witness greatness!
The both of them seem like nice dudes lol.. If you just met them and didn't know who they were, you wouldn't think they beat people to death 😂😂
HEY "SATAN", YOU BETTER NOT FIX THIS FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU DO, YOU'RE THE ULTIMATE CLOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Canelo still ducking that smoke 💨🌬🚭 with David 🥊💯
Can’t believe Showtime is done with boxing.
DONATE TO HELP THE FALSELY ACCUSED
I know Bo Bo can fight but beating the “Mexican Monster” is going to be a very hard “ PROJECT “
Save the very best best for last! Canelo vs. Benavidez will be one of the biggest fights in boxing history!  but first he needs to pass Demetrius Andrade  💯👊🔥👊
I got Andrade looking like he can win early. And than getting absolutely pummeled as the fight goes on and the end will come quick close first 3-4 rounds than benavidez starts beating him up and I got benavidez by tko/ko 8
Let’s go Benavides!
All I have to say is Canelo got dibs on the winner
Is it me or this mf was tryna sound like Mike Tyson on the podium 😭😭😭
Boo boo is about to get the fukin breaks beat off of him.
I have Incredible respect for both fighters for taking this fight. There can be only one man standing. For one its sky's the limit for the other it's gonna be picking up the pieces. I'm gonna go for the BOOGEYMAN. BOO BOO. I've just seen flashes of excellence when he's needed to step on the pedal. But I'm sure it's gonna be a fantastic fight which ever way it goes. Can't wait 👊💥👊💣💥👊👊
There are a lot of fat kids when there kids ok aren’t we all going through this when we are young ? I’m happy your strong, , thank god we are who we are today only because Jesus Christ
Andrade is a middleweight version of Wilder, minus the power.
Now tell me why none of these guys talk about Bivol??
I'm super pumped for this fight  and I love both guys but I'm rolling with Boo Boo all day this is going be a cake walk for him.
Love that brotherly bond, I wish my brother and I where close like that. God bless you Benavidez !
First HBO called it quits then DAZN lied through their teeth now Showtime  getting out the game.
I’m giving All Access their flowers now 🫡 showtime you will be missed
Boring fight not ppv worthy. Definitely not paying for this.
This is a great match up.
It’s about time PBC fighters start fighting each other
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SHOWTIME, YOUR EXISTENCE WAS NEVER IN VAIN, I LOVE YOU FUCK, YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE, AFTER THESE FIGHTS THE ESSENCE DIES.
I’m Mexican and I wouldn’t be mad if boo-boo wins he seems like a cool nice gentleman 😊
So siked for this fight . Boo Boo is a warrior, but Go Benavidez.
Andrade better win talking all that racist shit beforehand let’s see you back it up then.
I gotta stick with Andrade that boy çan fight no upset both men can fight
I really can’t call it but I see an upset 😮
We need Benavidez vs Canelo 🫠
David Benavidez has the DNA potential to beat any one in the ring. Benavidez needs to improve his head & hip motions and footwork slides. Benavidez as persona is a humble boxer; that is why MIKE TYSON, BARRERA, JUAN MANUEL & the Mexicans  legend, Julio Cesar Chavez; all of them believe Canelo Alvarez would be a " dead meat " for Benavidez.
Figured. The legends of Mexico hating on Canelo. Let’s see, if canelo beats him (if) will they still be sour. They gave him props until their name felt down that chart .
I like both fighters, it may be a closer fight then people think. Boo Boo has been pro for 15 years but really hasn't fought a top guy at Middleweight or Super Middleweight. May the best fighter win.
Both of these guys biggest fight of their career
We all know you can fight but we all know PBC has no problem robbing you to make Canelo vs Benavidez
Brotherly love, family. It's beautiful! Bless these fighters.
Booboo unanymous
Benavidez is about to put the BEATS on Adnrade lmao
Great work Showtime producers.
Proper odd character Boo Boo!  Don’t see him beating the Mexican Monster neither 👹
No matter what, showtime always produces the best pre fight and post fight content. Gonna miss this series
Benavidez vs Andrade is a very good match up, but that boy Andrade is going to see why "The Mexican Monster Benavidez" is a savage that fights with controlled anger from ppl not believing in him.. Benavidez is coming for blood and a brutal K.O.🥊😈
This is going to be a banger. All Access strikes gold again!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🙏
ANDRADE DOESN’T HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE SO IF HE WINS ITS NOTHING BUT THE MONSTER HAS ALOT TO LOSE
Benavides will be technically flawless for this fight and will catch Boo Boo slipping. Benavides wins by Decision.
Love both fighters tremendously, Canelo won't fight David until he loses watch💯. Canelo don't want smoke with Benavidez. & Meech should fight Crawford if he wins against Canelo. But Bud could retire after he beats Canelo tbh
Crazy how all the mexican fighters  of the past don’t like canelo and want benavidez to win😂
I like demetrius man he is funny and  humble guy really underrated fighter . It will be interesting to see what happened in this fight .
Did Benavidez just saying boxing is the best job in the world?
Is this not the most exciting cars this year?
The reason most old Mexican boxers like him so much is cause they hate canelo because everyone says he's the best Mexican fighter of all time. The Jealously is real
Cutting all that long hair should give Andrade 10 more pounds of muscle
I'M FKN BEYOND READY TO SEE THIS FIGHT❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗ FKN RIGHT❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗
That's dope mike Tyson gave David his nick name.Mexican monster 😂
It sucks that no matter how many title eliminator fight david fights .. canelo won't give him that chance..  The wbc won't strip.. amd the other organizations do much.
Can't take David's attitude no more. Andrade plz...
What kind of BbL is that?
Enjoyed the Showtime production and All Access series! Kudos and thanks for all the good memories!
Thanks showtime.
lets not forget HBO started this docuseries narrative and they were exvellent at it, and after they were gone Showtime carried the crown well, but I will miss it when is gone too...
„ Great Fight “ This is Boxing at'is best ❗❗❗
Is going to be better than the plant fight because this time is animosity, no drama.
18:37
This is going to be good fight both are good let's the best win.
Fight Of The Year No Cap!!💯
Boo boo is fony.
250K views 6 likes? 😂 broooo
nice!
HBO boxing was better
The Face of Boxing will FOREVER be Mexican / Mexican American Boxers — the pool they have with talent and superstar power is insane !! Love from 🇬🇧
When HBO Boxing went so did 24/7 now SHOWTIME Boxing is going so will All Access, this sucks.
I'm shivering... 🔝👊
Cokehead Benavidez.   Dude is lame with the Weightbully tactics.  How about go to your real weight class? He’s a Light Heavyweight
Actually Crazy how fast they made this fight.
I got benevidez jr to win fight 🎉🏆 ✝️
What are we going to do without Showtime??
Both great men, I like benavidez but may the best man win
😏 Exotic Cat, Eating Raw Meat. 💯
This fight is going to be a good one
Go Benavidez Supporting you all the way from Tunisia 🇹🇳 and Palestine 🇵🇸 will be Free !
Canelo beating both easily
Why is this fight ppv?😂
David is a beast but booboo has scary skills
Let's go David Benavidez 😤💯🔥🥊
Two guys at the top. I like both, but BooBoo loses if Rozier is giving him instructions.
I will like to see Andrade VS plant ☘️ after this fight
Great fighter benavidez but you lack skill and it will show soon.
😏 "My Flag, His Flag." 🥊
Upset city.
Rest in peace all access man
Benavidez need to worry about changing that smoke detector battery 😂
Andrade will dominate benavidez.  If benavidez wins it only proves that memo heredia has him juiced to the gills
PHX, AZ BBY ‼️ 602 stand up😤 TEAM MONSTER 🦍
Cannot wait!!
i hope we get an epilogue this time
I swear showtime access has a way of making fights look alot closer skill wise shows off what you don't get to see before the fight that work being put in aside from the family part of it that wins us all over ill miss these fa sho‼️❤️🥊
Mall Ntfo🥊🥊 of that bum "Hoe" se!!
Let me read the experts comments now😂
What!?!? David’s wife knows how to cook wooow
All Access thank you for all the years of me laying in bed watching this great show. U will be missed
"The Cocaine 🥄😤Monster"OVER HYPED OVERRATED🙄🙄🙄  NOOO TECNICAL SKILLS..👎👎💩
Now this a real opponent for Benavidez. This is going to be a showdown.
The Benavidez brothers definitely wasn’t fighting for real
Dude not finna beat Andrade
Andrade by stoppage. Benavidez gets caught by a big shot while he's busy with his combinations. Styles make fights!
I want BOOBOO to win so bad, but I feel like I need the Benavidez/Canelo fight!
I feel skill wise, Andrade has a lot of variation, but Benevidez has that unreal drive and determination to win, Also I feel his natural size could be an advantage in this one. I feel this will be super competitive fight, but I am leaning towards a Benevidez win in a tough fight.
GO BOO BOO❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🤴🏿💯💯💯💯💯GET HIM🥇🥇🥇💯💯💯💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Let's go benavidez the monster 🇲🇽  🇪🇨 💯 💪
I like Benavidez and I hope he gets his shot at Canelo but lets keep it a buck. David was being outboxed in the first 5-6 rds against Plant. If Plant had the better stamina, Benavidez would have lost. David excels with flat-footed fighters. If you stand in front of him and try to trade, its either going to be a quick night or very long night
I don’t like this fight for Andrade. He should have waited another year or two. He’s a good fighter but Benavidez is on another level. For this weight class Benavidez is a big fighter and he has a lot of power. I don’t see the Mexican monster losing this fight.
I love ANDRADE 😂😂😂😂 HES A Damn comedian
DO NOT USE BANK OF AMERICA THEY RIPPED ME OFF FOR $536.00 AND GOT AWAY WITH IT THEY OPERATE A GLITCHY, FAULTY BANKING SYSTEM
Let Go Boo Boo!!!!
Damn I know that’s crazy little bro being better when you started out so hot it’s crazy
The thumb nail looks more like lomachenko V Kambosos 🤣
What’s up with the propaganda to weaken men at the end?
Marquez a Canelo hater…I love Benavides… think he’s a throw back fighter… this is a dangerous fight becuz Andrade has skills, speed and good boxing iq… not much upside … high risk low reward.
his wife went overboard on that bbl and them lips.
Man these will be missed! The way they can just capture you in 30 minutes! You get a feeling of knowing both and aligning with one specifically the views and angles to capture the art and beauty of the sport and finally the sounds/music of goosebumps going through your arms ready to watch 2 men fight for honor/respect! Oh and a whole lot of 💰!
His not Mexican and his not a monster.
Gyyyyat to watch it 100 💯
they really said andrade was "proven" lmao
Lol Marquez don’t Canelo.
Dam 😢showtime gonna be missed but they gave some mega fights to go out with a bang 🎉❤
Not common to say “I love you” for a Latino dad. I believe I never heard my dad say it but he always supported me. Very tough on me and sometimes inhumane but sadly that’s how he had it so he brought it to me but If I ever have a kid I’ll end that treatment.
Going to be a great fight really 50/50
It amazes me that when that father has tears in his eyes talking to his kids about how bad he treated them the 2 kids look angry like they still want to kill him. While at the same time saying how much they love each other. I've never seen 2 people who look so angry like David and Jose
It’s starting to look like it’s gonna be a good ass fight
Benavidez vs plant episode was better
Man this is going to be such a good fight. Two absolute dogs with huge respect for one another.
I actually feel bad for David that he believes that his father's abusiveness is what made him great. It was what was inside David to make himself great that did it. By giving His dad that acknowledgment, he's taking away everything he work for. Trauma doesn't build greatness, trauma also breaks people. That's my point about David that greatness was inside of him and had nothing to do with his father
RIP showtime. This sucks.
damn finally fighters stepping up and earning their shot at winning the lotto ticket
David by stoppage.   It won’t be close
Benavidez gonna walk Andrade down and stop him
Andrade is quick, hard, moves and pound for pounds, I will go for him on this one...✋
I really watched this to see benevidez wifes 🍑. Boy thats a woman
David needs to go after Andrade from the opening bell. He cant give up the first 5 rds like he does. Boo boo could run away with it. David needs to attack the body with hard shots from the get!
This the last all access? 🥹
Andrade don’t even sound like he want it real talk
So who gonna do all access now? 😭😭😭 this what gets me hyped for the fight…
Easy win for David and Demetrius better be and stay humble or else he's gonna eat his own hard words.
I got benavidez but Demetrius is a great fighter
Can’t wait!!
I fast forwarded through that Mexican speaking ass ish. This not Mexico, Speak English!
Man All of em Boxing Promoters , Associates , agencies , houses , clubs and all of those who and who's of boxing needa stop this crap and any freaking how put this monster in the ring against Canelo , and not let it be another what if  it's way too good of a fight to be deterred and wasted by boxing politics , ducking , shitting and every thing else that's happening Make the fight that everyone wants and cares to see.
My cousin boo-boo is going too get rid off the monster!! Team Cape Verde 🇨🇻 🦾🦾
Both super good boxers hard to choose to win…
Showtime narrator the truth 💯💯💯💯  Love these
these films are just works of art, delightful
Nobody named booboo should be allowed to represent boxing. I hope The Monster makes an example out of him. Everything counts in boxing.
If your not given your flowers get out there and take them boo boo
This should be a great fight and it will go the distance and if David don't knock him down he will lose I have no picks for this fight
10:05  for all the bud haters .. lol THIS is SNAC..
You come in to view boxers and you leave with tears and joy , why are you guys taking this away from us ?
DB gonna win DA leaps to much DA fights shook DB got no fear he gonna beat DA they both been knocked down in a fight b4 but DA folded up by a flush shot DB was more of  a flash knock down
Benavidez is big strong and fast!!! Hes gonna show Andrade and his delusional fans what Boxing is all about.
Andrade...will not Only Showcase his skills..but also shed light on David Benavidez's Overly heightened Status💯🙌
Love hearing the brothers talk about each other and see them spar.  💪
Such Nonsense🤦🤦🤦 ....🤷David has NOTHING to compare to the "True" Mexican Greats...like Salvador Sanchez/Julio Ceasar Chavez Sr./Ricardo Lopez/& Juan Manuel Marquez.... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Prime Calzaghe, Hopkins, Jones, Nunn, Toney among others destroy this kid... He Truely hasn't faced "💩!"... Basically gets Elite Status for acheiving Next to nothing 🤷🙌
If the big brother just let's charlo hit him like that he is done!!!
Márquez wanting Benavidez to be the face of boxing so bad , just to hate on canelo 🤣🤣🤣 Bunch of washed up boxers trying to stay relevant 💀
2:46 SNAC program lol… ppl talk about bud but they don’t know them ppl working out the same way some other coach will “THINK” would work … no supplements .. no injections… no steroids… just methodical Exercises. That’s it…
Expecting this to be a draw and get to a rematch. Either of these guys are not easy for Canelo. He better fight them soon.
Elly a hoe I just don’t like him it is what it is.
No Complaints 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑....the wifey certainly isnt complaining either....go with the flow....Even after Davids' loss..things be cool🤑🤑🤑🤑🙌
All access is the best part of Showtime boxing.
Was it just me or does Andrade not know how to interview? He seems a little immature and uneducated.
To Jose Benavidez Sr., l truly only believe you wanted what's best for your kids, while they were growing up. I'm a black man and l did the same with my kids tough on them too, so sir totally understand your sentiments...we love our kids tough thinking we are preparing them for the cold hard world and they sometimes don't realize, what we were doing until they become dads themselves...but l do understand you sir.. you taught yourself what you needed for the betterment of your boys, and l respect that about you..✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
My son listening to the Spanish Benavidas speaking..not watching the video....says daddy what is thaaaat😂😂😂😂i said its Spanish. He said they talking too fast 🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's great to hear Benavidez Snr say, “I was afraid to say I love you cos I thought you guys were gonna become weak”. That's genuine humility and honesty from a loving father. When you want to raise strong tough kids, these thoughts go through your mind as a father ❤
I think Andrade wins decision...Andrade is a skilled yet awkward with power. Benavidas gon walk fwd with quick power....i got Andrade. Like both guys, both Americans, win win for me
🎉🎉🎉Cheers to everyone @ Showtime! God bless you all & your families, as well. Duces from L.A. Ca.
Benavidez got this I think, really great match up, Andrade needs this kind of name, proves both men don’t duck anyone, love that!
Andrade is definitely a unique spergie character. This is going to be great
Damn Showtime !,We gonna miss these
Drade going to 💤
Jose Jr. is way past his prime
Nobody will out do SHOWTIME all access the best build ups and insights on the fighters we’ll ever get exceptional production I’m gonna miss it!
Fighting for the right to get their ass kicked by Canelo. 😂  Seriously though, it's nice to see them try and earn the shot at Canelo instead of running their mouths.
Benavides hasn’t really fought anyone good.hard to become a legend when u keep fighting nobody’s…tank and canelo are legends
Gonna miss you bro time
This might be the only man I see matching up with the Mexican monster and the same for his opponent,great match up anyone can win this ,I think are top two in these class
The monster ,gone a moop the floor with this booboo ..
I respect David for making this fight happen. You can tell he wants a challenge and he knows Demetrius is too talented to be shelved his whole career. Def getting a good payout.
I am a benavides fan but andrade is just so humble and joyfull may the best man win ... I dont see anyone beating david though 😊
Is Andrade out of his mind?
to the producers and writers of All Access. Thank you, throughout the years i saw the Progression, the modernization, the dynamic sound engineering and mixing.  Top Tier TV!  Every episode is better than the last. This and the Tank vs Garcia episode this year are Emmy worthy pieces of art. [Barry Pepper 🙏👑🥀] Take your bow and flowers my friend.You are the Voice of Boxing. Thank you all ! You will be sorely missed.
El niñito está junta a su papá benavidez en todos lados no hay duda que será una estrella del boxeo cuando sea grande
i hope they are never able to speak straight again after this fight
I absolutely love showtime production. PS, That cat has no damn business in there lol what a goofy ass flex by David.
Awesome fight! I’m going for Benavidez but Andrade is an excellent fighter
Andrade got a glass chin! 💤 He has never faced some one like the Monster!!
I like BooBoo but he is just to small and he fades late. That’s a bad mix against Benavidez.
Mexican monster ?? You are CALIFORNIA GUY 😅😅😅😅CANELO ES EL MEXICANO MONSTRUO 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
7:22 problem is theyre already looking ahead at Canelo
Benavidez to win but what a great fight this is going to be!
We're rooting for Andrade. May the best man win.
Another “someones O has to go!” I believe Benavidez is going to be the best he’s ever looked in this fight. He knows what is waiting after this fight, and he’s not about to let that opportunity slip by. This will be a big test for Andrade, and I think a lot of people are overlooking him as well. Boxing the last two years has been heating back up and I can’t wait to see what the future holds in store for us fans!
Crawford got stripped and he just fought for undisputed this summer. Canelo gets to keep his belts but he fought a 154lber 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Wonder why boxing is dying and becoming a side show
Maby Manguia and Berlinga can fight to challenge winner of this bout then challenge Canelo or GGG and get busted!😅
Classic throwback
This should be a good fight . May the best man win
Two great fighters,shame one has to lose...leaning towards David in this one.Either way it will be a tear up.
This whole thing was about David I learned very little about Andrade
Long live Showtime
Bobo shocks the world
This reminds of Spence vs Crawford where I can't predict how it goes.
And what makes this worse is this is the last all access you gotta be shitting me 37 years and go out with this one
This is going to be speed vs power
It's  been a great year for boxing. This fight included 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾. My the best man win .
This is the last one y’all 😢 I’m so sad.
🍻
Boy Benavidez is really a Mexican Monster... Good to see Boo Boo get his first big fight 💙
Betting my house on Benavidez
🍑 😅. Have mercy
This is the results on the importance of a father being present in they’re sons life! Congratulations, to both fathers! And may the best man win !
Andrade doesn’t have a cool bone in his body 😂
Props to both fighters who made it happen with no bs .
Ufc needs to take some notes on their all access stuff... I really like showtime boxing, and dislike the ufc it more fueled toward money money
LET'S  GO⛳
This is so special makes me want to be more involved with my sons big ups to the Benavides
Excellent video 💯👏
Nothing like all access I'm definitely going to miss it this is what makes the fight a must see
Boo boo is way to slick for David
I’ve never seen so many casuals in the comments. Andrade is runny shit, hasn’t fought nobody, and looks trash when fighting nobody. He went for the final payday and will retire after this fight.
Thank you SHOWTIME!!😢 FFF DAZN 😂
Excellent Job!! This is legitimately one of my favorite All Access Episodes!
0:17 showtime knew what they were doing lol
Nothing like All Access 🔥
There's a reason people avoid fighting Andrade.......
They might not know who Boo Boo is, but all im gonna say is, the man can box. Don’t write him off cause you act like you know about him. He got all the tools to get the job done.   Ironically, this might be slightly off the walls, but Boo Boo seems like the Dennis Rodman of boxing. 😂
My favourite fighter is Terrence Crawford and i think he has the potential to win against every fighter in any weight class. YES I SAID IT !!!!
This is a great fight. Finally demetrius andre will fight. Demetrius andre ducked by billy ho saunders
Boo Boo has been a dawg since we was kids in the Amateurs. Had he not been Cheated he would’ve been an Olympic gold medalist 💯….. This will be a good fight but I don’t believe Benevidez has the proper experience to win
Nobody puts on like showtime 🥊💯
They all want canelo till they in the ring with him.. he will violate that boii with gut shots his stomach is weak
No debería pelear entre Mexicanos, Que la se mantenga la Historia México cuna de CAMPEONES  !!
Can tell its over this is the latest episode ever.. Respect it tho yall gave us so much...  Flowers for showtime boxing 🎉🎉..
Seems like camera man keeps his eyes on benavidez wife ass..i would too
Very very good video documentary 👏👏👏👏
TEAM BENEVIDEZ BUT WILL BE A GREAT FIGHT
We will miss all access
Props to David for making this fight.  Andrade is not someone fighters usually pick to fight.  David’s doing what he said and fighting the best.
Booboo go nightnight. Zzzzzz
Bobo reminds me of the great Joe Calzaghe!
rozier always look liked a mini DJ im sorry had to say it
My fam booboo finally gets hos chance to shine. Been in the gym since single didgets. Proud of my boy 💯
Andrade gone be 1hp just like plant was hopefully we got a better Ref this go round I wanna bet Benavidez decision but Im scared he stops Andrade late somebody help
I love this brotha Andrade, i think Jose gone pull the upset but David will lose or it may be a draw..
This is gonna be a War, may the best man win
Andrade is 1 weird ass dude 😂 😂
Va ser buena pelea los dos son buenos pero Benavides es un poquito mejor.
I love both of these guys... I don't want either of them to lose. They both deserve the best
Andrade is a idd guy, but it makes him funny. Interesting character.
Benavidez gonna f him up
Benevidez wins by stoppage round 10
Mike Tyson told something to Golden Boy when he was telling Mike how rough his dad was with him. Mike asked him to imagine how much worse Oscar's father's life must of been. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I held things against a parent but I know their life as a child was much rougher.
Interesting that his language is much cleaner in his own language
I'm estatic for this fight! Fan of both fighters but on fight night may the best fighter win.
Watching the Benavidez brothers spar was nice.
Who ever manage booboo career  did not manage him the right way. He should been getting big fight long time ago.
I got Andrade.  Either way winner gets ducked by canelo
What the fuck?  I don't want Showtime boxing to end.😢
2 weeks to go… the countdown had begun. The sleeping giant is about to be awoken
OMG I am super pumped up for this fight, respect and props to both fighters, it will be hell of a fight, plus Jose Benavidez jnr v Jermall CHARLO  fight will be awesome
David looks a little bigger then his bro do they both fight at super middle? And how does David have three WBC belts I know he's Interim champ but how does have the other 2 isn't Canelo undisputed? Are those old belts? If so fighters only come out with the belts they currently control or have in my experience David got stripped twice correct?
Andrade smokes him
I love David’s fight game, but the first Gavril fight was really close.
I like Benivedez alot, but I want to see Demetrius win this fight so he could make an attempt at a Canelo fight. Once Crawford smashes Spence again, he might could also fight the winner of a Canelo/Crawford fight. Him against Crawford sounds good because I don't see Canelo beating Crawford.
canelo k.o. plant and he didn't, i bet canelo if this two will fight.
Both these dudes are kinda loco should be great battle
😂😂The Mexican legends want Benavidez to whoop that fraud Canelos ass😂😂
Andrade by finesse and 9th rd KO mark my words
❤
The Mexican monster is stopping this dude…no doubt! 🇲🇽
Benavidez has a 100% KO/TKO probability against Black fighters. I would not be surprised if Andrade gets stopped early but I think it will not go the distance.
David's gonna be the one to stop Canelo, that's why the old greats are rooting for him,he reminds them of the old school technicians
Benevidez by TKO🥊
We’re going to miss these all access episodes 🥲🤧
Boo Boo is not burnt yet. He can win.
Good on DB for giving Andradite a shot, he is avoided I think but he doesnt put bums on seats like DB. This could be technical at times but when both guys collide I think we'll se some good skills on display
This is gonna be a tough fight as long as Andrade is in his best shape
it's carzy to see the Mexican boxing legends want to see Benavidez fight and win against Canelo but Canelo's Mexicann fans are terrified of that fight.🤣
*Benavidez is slow, uncoordinated, and predictable.* *Andrade should be quick enough to counter, and move.*
Kudos to "BOTH" fighters who believe in taking on the best fighters in your weight division carrying another belt while still in your PRIME during your ERA "unlike" El Pollo 🐔 Alveraz. This will be an action pack 50/50 fight but I am familiar with Demetrius Andrade's full "capabilities" so I will have to give him the "edge". 🤓👍🏽
So happy to see benavidez family together even after all the differences, jose getting shot, father being emotionally abusive, David getting bullied in childhood and yet both became champs and Jose sr being proud of you guys, emotional moment indeed ❤
Andrade’s personality is exactly like he fights…awkward😂
Boo Boo for the win
Ready for this one!
His “ahorible” fighter 😂
Boo boo gonna go Boom boom.Break those ribs 100% Awkward with power and precision.Takes him out rnd 10 or unanimous.♣️♠️⬛🖤
Jermal messed up...he could of got the huge money bag fighting canelo or even david but now he fighting the brother and nothing to take away from José because he is a monster to but has 2 losses now..Jose was the hardest fight Crawford had..
Am going the monster tko 5th or 6th round!!
I'm glad for both these dudes,I wish them both the best,and safe travels!!! All access will be missed as well!
The framing of this video was disgustingly bias. A whole lot more effort was put into telling David’s story.
Time for Andrade to show his greatness!
THE NARRATOR DESERVES AN GRAMMY
What country boo boo from
JR stops Mell and David stops BOO BOO 😊
4:27 didn’t know Andrade was a right handed southpaw
With showtime boxing going away does that mean that PBC is done too?
I always knew Juan Manuel Marquez is the real deal . this dude was a beast at his time and when he told Benavidez : " we re rooting for you to fight canelo " , I ve even liked him more ! Benavidez has the true Mexican spirit . Canelo is a coward
Mexican monster benavidez. Great to see Marco antonio barrera legend
Andrade is Gona win I think be a good fight but andrade wins
love it.
Something off about Boo Boo. I’m not sure what it is.
Benavidez dad too hard on himself if u see this i met u a bunch of times in la and u where allways nice at the wildcard and other places
This is last all access ?😢
the best fight at 168 hands down . gonna be more exciting than Canelo s last three fights combined !
Never been a fan of the Benavidez but the way their dad acknowledged his wrong doings is nothing short of admirable.  Respect.
I like Andrade but I think Benavidez is gonna maul him. Benavidez is young and at 25 he's only just coming into his grown man strength and has so much more neural capacity to learn and adapt in his craft. I'd like Benavidez to implement a biomechanics coach who can specifically work on his body mechanics in the ring (not a S&C coach) so he can fully maximise his innate Mexican-beast speed and power but with added defensive elusiveness and fluidity. He's got more room for growth than Canelo and I was a fan of Canelo way before he fought Floyd. I saw his progression and rise to the machine he is today.  Can't wait for the next 5-10 years of boxing. This is shaping up to be one of the best generations of boxing in the last 30 years (except heavyweight).
“Without trama Their can’t be no greatness” I felt that 💯💪🏻
That Savannah cat or Serval cat is dope..@Josebenavidezjr
Andrea doesn't have enough power to keep David off him I think David is gonna walk thru him you have to box use the ring on David score shots don't stand still in front of him
As a Mexican im Benavidez all day, but Andrade had a gorgeous uppercut. This will be a great brawl. Cant wait.
I loved all access videos! YOU WILL BE MISSED FROM THE DEEPEST PART OF MY HEART!
I don’t recall, Canelo knocked out plant. 😂😂😂
Andrade a strange dude:)
They not even going full speed sparring
I've never seen @Davidbenavidez #Mexicanmonster #Elbanderaroya on the back foot.👍🥊💪
Lmao look at all the Canelo haters 😂
ANDRADE CAN WIN THIS FIGHT ,BENAVIDEZ IS 175 LB FIGHTHING ON 168 ,MORREL 168 CHAMPION IS BETTER BOTH
Super excited for this fight
#Davidbenavidez @Davidbenavidez The only one that said you was gonna be World champ.... @Kellypavlik #Kellypavlik
They finally not ducking boo boo
I think Demetrius Andrade has gotten hit in his head so many times that it's actually knocked him stupid, just because of the way he tries to say that he has the "special sauce" and he thinks David Benavides doesn't? Lol wow, don't get me wrong, Demetrius is pretty good but he isn't on the next level where he needs to be able to hang with guys like David B and Canelo. He's gonna get a rude awakening on the 25th lol.
Leave your children at home for this Fight
Benavidez Going To Put A Hurting On Andrade 😂💪🏼🔥
Bruhhhh.  The 2 Mexican legends, plus Mike Tyson on his corner 🚩🚩🚩🚩 Let’s go Maryvale !!!! Boo Boo is hilarious 😂
Boo Boo wins this fight like Ward beat Chad Dawson
El monstro 🇪🇨🇪🇨🇲🇽🇲🇽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Did you all catch it while talking to Marquez? He said the Canelo is coming and that he's ready. He didn't say let's hope or I want it. So again, that was the plan all along with pbc deal is for Canelo to fight Benavidez on the last of the 3 fights. That also helps pbc because of Benavidez wins they probably get 4 fights out of Canelo because of rematch
Showtime is the best in boxing
Seeing Marquez on face time got me so hyped one of my favorite fighters man!!!!
Showtime boxing is the best to ever do it we need Trump back cause since the demoncrats everybody going put of business
Inactivity has proven to be a curse. And what a pity this is  the end of Showtime boxing forever
Bro that is NOT a pet. 🤣🤣🤣 should be a good fight I guess. Haven’t seen enough of Boo Boo though but best of luck to them both. If I was a betting man I’d put it on Benavidez to win.
@ 0:16 the camera man knew what he was doing
Please don't leave showtime 😢
Iv never seen Andrade in a war in the ring. Tip tappy bullshit.
Of course that hating clown Marquez had something to say about Canelo. Salty ahh clown. 😂
Andrade bout to get smashed tf up bro this aint even funny how they doing him he a snack for Benavidez.
I feel like the exotic cat is a bad omen for Benavidez.
Andrade hasn't fought elite opponents, and david has fought the better fighters. But david only loses if this goes to the cards. I just dont see booboo making it to the 12th
Ecuador 🇪🇨 must’ve mad show time still  saying Mexican moster 😂
Great fight 👏 👏 👏  I'm excited.
Canelo told Marquez in a phone call on a radio show I’ll drop to welterweight to fight you if you don’t believe in my skills lol Marquez wasn’t trying to get knocked out and told him to meatbhim at 140😂😂😂😂
BooBoo rep 4 the yitty 401 💥 🥊
marques es una legenda  pero tambien us una piche vieja con sus pedos de canelo tu tiempo ya paso deja que el corra su carrera como el quire
Nov 25th Booboo slays the Mexican Monster!!!!
David BENAVIDES VS Gallinelo Alvoroides Will Never Happen, Because Canelo IS a Coward.
The best fight Will be Subriel Matias vs Shongahom Ergashev.. Puerto Rico vs Uzbeco..
Why do mfers use a giant cast iton to cook a couple eggs
Man these always hype me up ima miss it 😢
Benavidez is gonna win. ✌️
The OutKast and the wildcard. Interesting.
Maan your team is special guys. Not a single production have you been biased, it has been an honour spending Sunday mornings here in Europe watching. I will not deny, there are plenty of times I showed up to training thanks to the motivation and love for the sport that you passed on guys, keep it up and hope you are back ASAP !!!
It’s really starting to hit me that this is the final end to an era. HBO 24/7 has been gone for 7 years now Showtime All Access will be no more. Two productions that just can’t ever be duplicated.
Great access, but I see Benavidez overlooking Andrade. NOT GOOD! Andrade UD!
12:15 el mancho😂
andrade is gonna be exposed. he hasn’t fought no top 10 in the division or 5. when was his last big fight? he’s already past 30 . no man.
People talk and just never do any investigating ! Neither of of those two have ever fought any one of note..Boo boo a.k.a Doo doo has never fought a true champion since he received the belt Neither has he been in the ring with any top ten contender and every contender he had the opportunity to get busy with, he backs  out..As for the Mexican Monster taco eater ! Who didnt want to fight him ? When he had the belt, did he call out any of the other belt holders ? NO ? Answered.Oh what what do both of them have to say about David morrel, they both passed him up ro fight lesser fighters ( YET ) EVERYONE ducks them. 😂😂😅 one more thing i need to mention about the taco eater, he claims he has so much power and said he guarantees he knocking out plant, oh we still waiting ! Guess he doesnt have all that much power when it comes to top ten fighters..
The Mexican monster is gonna take a shit on boo boo lol
It looks like boo boo on that one white girl 👃🏾
I think Benavides gonna win by TKO with andred getting too agressive after being hittup.
Both great boxers, can’t wait man.
That SNAC got BOO BOO tweak out like he on coke 😂😂😂
Benevides is not winning...Andrade hasn't been backed like a Canelo but that is his level, I actually think he beats Canelo. Benevides every fight at some stage looks vulnerable- Andrade takes him out
I feel an Crawford vs spence moment in Andrade favor.  I feel it!! I like how the great Mexican fighters on David Benavidez side and not canelo. 😂😂
🤔BOO BOO??? Don’t black people call pooping BooBoo???💯💯🤦🏽‍♂️
Top card hope is available in uk
This will be a great fight
CANELO DUCKING💯💯💯✊🏽 🦆 🦆🦆🦆🦆🤣
The Mexican monster getting love from the Mexican OG legends💪🏼🇲🇽🥊
If Benavidez wins this fight I don't know what else he has to do for canelo to give him a shot. If he doesn't give the Mexican monster the fight we all know what it is.
I have a feeling that Andreade is going to neutralise Benavidez’s come forward aggression
Andrade said “two guys in their prime” dude forgot he’s 35. lol
Andrade is gonna get pummeled 😂
Charlo bout to beat Jose ass
50/50 fight. I’m taking Andrade
Tres titulos a los 26 and canelo won how many at that time?? Shane Mosley, cotto!! Etc!!! Stfu!!!
I got boo-boo honestly
Not Juan Manuel Marquez meat riding 😂 dude is a straight hater 😂😂😂
David knows if he beat canelo he will have that Mexican fan base like canelo
Can’t wait puro Benavidez good luck to both  brothers
Doo Doo is a C level fighter at best
Boo Boo's going to dance circles against Benavidez until he can't dance no more and then.....it's lights out for Boo Boo 😴
Benavidez better be ready for Andrade hug game
SHOWTIME PLEASE DONT LEAVE BOXING PLEASE😢😢
Benavidez better real pbc is not on his side they will try to screw him over like in the plant fight.
Finally they grew some balls like Canelo. He saw Canelo was fighting the guys he was supposed to and dare to be great like Canelo.
👍
Amazon is gonna do the same with the same announcers
Siento que andrade va ganar , hay que ser honestos benavidez tiene velocidad y buenas combinaciones pero no tiene juego de pies ni de cintura, esta muy tieso de los pies. Andrade es mas tecnico en sus peleas ,y cuida mucho su guardia ,y este chavalo baja las manos cada que lanza combinaciones y descuida mucho la mandibula . Canelo no quieria aceptar la pelea con este muchacho por que canelo a dicho que le falta tener mas experiencia en cuanto a peleas y si queria darle la oportunidad pero cada vez que lo ven lo insultan o le gritan jose papa y equipo de todo tipo de groserias y pues al final si nos ponemos a pensar esto es un trabajo y si llegas gritandole a los patrones o aventando madres lo mas seguro es que nos van a correr. Y miren eso de entrenar con su hermano no le va dar resultados, el muchacho tiene un problema en su pierna y no le puede dar el ancho en un sparring de verdad. Necesita entrenar con sus sparrings  tecnicas que use demetrius andrade para que el se le acople mas su estilo de pelea y ya tenga mas o menos algo planeado para ese dia. En parte si tiene razon el pecoso necesita tener mas colmillo este chavo por que se quiere comer el mundo a mordidas y no es asi esto del box.
Little bro loses older bro wins another pay per view is born! Then losers rematch each other to help comeback. Boxing 101
You can’t call yourself a gambler and not bet on ANDRADE!!!! Win that 💰💰🎯
Benavidez should be the standard wbc world champion
"The New and Still undefeated"  or "And Still, The undefeated"  I dunno man.... Brain says David, Stomach tells me Andrade, Then they switch.
Can't wait
If Canelo doesn’t fight the winner of this fight next anyone & everyone that says they are a boxing fan needs to not purchase Canelo’s fight, his the one that told them fight each other & I’ll fight the winner.  These 2 guys are doing their bit now it’s his turn to keep his word. And it’s up to the real boxing fans to keep him accountable.
Andrade 🤡 Marquez also a 🤡
Benavidez got him tho
David's Spanish is really good.
I'll be there
Them this guy Andrade is really relax
07:00 crazy how much this niggas hate Canelo ,  love it hor hate it Canelo is the mexican GOAT and he gonna stop david in less than 9 rounds
Yes they are Warriors i can imagine all that preasure he put on them as kids but deep inside their hearts they are proud of he's father For what they ve have achieve now
Damn I like both of them I have to buy this PPV
Too hyped
David Benavidez is not Mexican I don’t know why he insist in taking the flag in the ring with him. He is not 100% Mexican he should stop doing that.
He s father still feels sorry and happy at the same time
David Morrell
Mike Tyson is a sellout menstrual show. Show me a Mexican telling Andrade to make them proud. Smh
Thanks for the video, SHOWTIME SPORTS
I love these
I like both,  but if we go by record, accomplishments and opponents they fought  David got him.
Brothers is a special bond
Gonna miss ALL ACCESS for sure.
Uncle frozone got his hands full on this one
Mike Tyson knows a killer when he sees one. David Benavides Mexican monster FIJI ISLANDER FAN 🇫🇯 🇫🇯 🇫🇯 🇫🇯
Gonna be a very good fight and I think Andrade will surprise us but hope for a Benavidez win!
Boy will I miss All access. Thanks for the good Times and memories showtime
Boy will I miss All access. Thanks for the good Times and memories showtime
He has MEXICAN ICONS routing him on… but when they say Canelo is NOT DOING ENOUGH.. it hate…”live from Mexico “we’re waiting for you to fight for ALL the belts” aka Canelo STEP UP🔥🔥🔥
SsSsSsSsSMeAgain!
Bro boo boo looks so excited to be in a big fight! Respect!✊🏽
If boo boo wins it easily puts him in top 2 pound for pound in my opinion
Canelo best weight it's at 160. Benavidez should be fighting bivol or bertevie (excuse the spelling) Canelo smokes all 160, even 168  Again benavidez should be challenging upper weight class divisions to be great. Bivol bs benavidez could be interesting if he beats canelo like bivol did. Most Mexicans jump up in weight class to be one of the best.
He's got blood of a Warrior aztec as well he's got to box canelo next year
I get it that Benevidez is the main guy but they really made this about him more than Boo Boo. Hopefully that switches in the next episode.
Demetrius Andrade personality is like Shannon Briggs, a little
Boo Boo gonna expose him mark mu words
11:30 😭😭 Andrade is random. Imma miss all access when it’s gone
Andrade really is a character and I love it. A man that walks to the beat of his own drum, that’s a dangerous fighter, they already are free. No cage around them. That’s where we see uncanny. Unexpected
Benavidez is getting rid of the trash just waiting on the golden ticket 😂
david aint even mexican!! he is ecuadorian! stop using the mexican flag! unless you really want to find out what a nightmare is
I like Benavidez alot, but id love to pound his wife also. Her cake is top tier.
Marquez  crazy canelo hater
benevides def andrade via ud. viva la vida  !
F***k Paramount for shutting down showtime boxing!
This guy is gonna really bring out the monster in Benavides
So this gone be the last epilogue we get. Wow. Ima stand on this. Bud vs Spence have the best epilogue I ever seen in my life.
Everything David says he has in his arsenal power etc,CANELO has same thing + EXPERIENCE AND RING I.Q&DEFENSE, David can’t beat Canelo just going to be a BIG ASS PAYDAY AND PPV RECORDS,AL HAYMON IS A PURE PUPPET MASTER BEHIND THE CURTAIN,he knows who can beat who&knows who can’t beat who😁
Salute to benevidez Ecuadorian heritage as well 🫡
If andrade wants to win he will win .
david messed up with this one. boo boo on another level david hasnt even reached
All the bullying and sad memorys he takes  it out in the ring
Doodoo's gonna lose by stoppage.
It's hard to call a winner but I'm edging David for the W. If Andrade does it I won't be shocked though.
This is going to be a WAR!!! Very exciting for this
grew up on all access breaks my heart that it’s ending. but a new opportunity awaits, i hope amazon comes in and does something special for boxing.
He overcome he's fears
Boxing going to DAZAN OR PRIME😩😫🤦🏾‍♂️smh🥊DAZAN PRESS CONFERENCES smh lol compared to SHOWTIME 😩CHESS vs CHECKERS,and prime hell naw
I like both guys!!! Im ridding with the hole team andreade but I worry with his lack of experience at the weight and inactive in general.
Im not gonna lie I am a little worried with BOO  BOO due to skills and he could win on the score cards but David got that constant job as well but man its a 50 50 fight cant wait
I AM LISTENING AND WATCHING EVERYTHING CALLED BOXING
Nothing like a MAYWEATHER ALL ACCESS 😂🐐TBE🎯
Bro sounds like mike tyson
I don't know who I am rooting for here. Let me just root for boxing. May the best man win 🏆
I love both, but believe me if ANDRADE has a big heart ♥️ and wants to win he will be the winner 🙏🏽🇺🇸🇩🇴🇺🇸
I love benavidez but ain't no match to Canelo!! Canelo will whoop that ass!!
bro sounds just like aljo
marquez really called benavidez and starts talking about were rooting for you against canelo. this dude has always been a hater for a decade when canelo said he had no problem fighting floyd at 147 but didnt want to fight canelo at that weight. marquez said it had to be at 140, a coward marquez is. marquez also recently said that pitbull cruz will be the next mexican great, but canelo isnt a top 10 mexican fighter all time? pure hate this clown marquez is, and lets face it marquez just has that one great KO but hes always fell short
Whoever can take a better Punch will  Win this fight....Let's Go
Andrade hasn’t fought no one and it will show November 25. Benavides in round 8 by stoppage.
I got Benavidez but it wont be easy but Sugar Bear gonna have to come get BOO BOO out of the ring
THESE EPISODES ARE FOREVER LEGENDARY! THE MAN WHO STORY WRITES AND VOICES THE SENTENCES ARE LEGENDARY!
That don't look like Phoenix 🤔😁
RIP SHOWTIME SPORTS. I’ll miss you guys. 💪🏾🥊
I thought he was fighting Charlo
Thanks for everything Showtime!
"Boo Boo" Andrade vs David benevedaiz has the potential to be an all time great fight if the fans Get to see the best version of Andrade and David benevedaiz in the Ring.
Boo boo could’ve been here sooner if he had just taken the right fights instead of dropping out of a charlo fight not fighting Lara after canelo and calling him a boring fighter not dropping out of the Parker fight not dropping his belt once someone with a pulse came into his division his lack of competition is his own fault being good is only half the battle if you bring in no money you won’t get big fights period
Best to ever cover boxing, top tier best production by far
Much respect to these African brothers let’s have a great fight
I've actually started watching this all access Show 15:00 Ago and the Views have gone from 70,000 to 75,000 within 15:00 minutes.
The 2 benavidez fighting 2 inactive fighters no body said nothing 🤔
Boy, I love Marquez as a fighter but he sure is a snake. I feel bad for him
I'm starting to see the slurred speech in Boo Boo
Yo is booboo okay? Bro acts like a cornball
YEAH BY NOT FIGHTING RELEVANT FIGHT ON HIS WEIGHTCLASS CA AND ANDRADE ISNT REALLY ON HIS WEIGHTCLASS AND PEOPLE BLIND EYE THAT FACT HE IS 6'3 SMH HE SHOULD FIGHT EQUAL OR ABOVE HIS HEIGHT THAT ARE TOP BOXERS TOO
I got Benevidez. Rozier as a trainer especially for this fight is not going to help Andrade. Rozier is absolutely terrible. He told D Jacobs that he was winning with Canelo in between rounds🤣😂
Algorithm
Amazing production always by show time 👏🏾👏🏾
“Their clash represents that calculus an  exploration of the per found complexity baked into existing in this sport” -SHOWTIME #youwillbemissed
The only good thing about showtime leaving is that we don’t gotta hear from that weasel
Funny looking at the comments and what people believe when it comes to both fighters it does remind me of the talking points behind Errol Spence vs Bud Crawford with David being Spence and Boo Boo being Crawford.  David just beats everybody up just like Spence did. Completely grinds you down to dust by the later rds and he usually gets the stop. Sounds alot like Spence doesn't it.  While on the other hand Boo Boo is the highly skilled, highly disrespected but also ducked fighter who can do a little bit of everything and he's a southpaw who people believe is chiny.  Who does that sound like? A lot like Bud Crawford right. We heard all those same things about Bud having a terribly weak resume, him being chiny and maybe past his prime.  Does this mean that Boo Boo is going to shock the world and stop David? Probably not, but what is does say is don't be surprise that it's a better fight than what you thought and perhaps it could be an upset.
This is going to be a epic fight ! Like both fighters but I think the Mexican Monster been to active never takes his foot off the gas . Boo Boo is very skilled if he has the gas tank he could pull off a victory .
Boo boo 35 year old prospect 😂😂 Benavidez will smoke boo boo Rooting for boo but I don’t see it
Boo Boo a wild dude but I rock wit em!! N been rockn wit me for a very long time now!!!! Back when everybody was scared to fight him!!! N they still scared to fight em!! I’m just happy n excited that he’s getting this look n opportunity n the world gets to see him!! I rock with the Mexican Monster too for sure!!! This will be an incredible fight!!! May the best man win!! I’m good either way. Can’t wait!!!
Benavidez stops and hurts Andrade badly!! Fight won’t be competitive.
If that fight goes further into the rounds it's a wrap for Andrade! David is to strong in the later rounds and Boo boo tends to fall off
🔥🔥🔥
Tell me why I felt like clapping after the intro🤣😂😂
There’s nothing better than the showtime engine doing a promo before the fight  Thanks for all the fights
Marquez always talking canelo 😂
Im gonna miss ALL ACCESS Episodes,Farewell😔
Man I love both these fighters. May the best man win. All the very best/success  to both gladiators, their teams and their families.
Botha records have non but bulbs aside from Caleb
Bravoo Andrade.. 💪🏿💪🏿
A tournament could save boxing. Almost every division has good fights that should have happened years ago.
I'm here to remind you that Benavidez is not Mexican, he may be a monster, but not Mexican.
HBO should slide right on in and make their comeback. Although it may be difficult to compete with all these other outlets like AMAZON PRIME, APPLE TV, etc
WHY do you keep calling him "mexican" he was born in arizona, he has never been at least one moth in  any city in mexico, he did not belong to mexico, he is from usa, the real mexican is CANELO,VALDEZ,CRUZ,MUNGUIA, they were born in mexico and only mexico, they know the culture, they worked here, this guy is from USA
Showtime does justice to fighters 😎
Both trash fighters... don't blame showtime for dropping boxing if this is considered a good fight
To me he's in the top five  among Crawford ,tank canelo
Boo Boo has a very awkward style…punches from all angles. Very difficult style to figure out. But after the 6 rounds …Benavidez walks him down and stops hims. 🤷‍♂️
The last All Access 😢
4me david won
I'll say this here. IF Andrade can bring power into the fight, he stops Benavidez. As long as I have watched him, I'm still not sure just how hard Demetrius hits. Perhaps its because he sometimes does not sit down on punches but if he can do that and connect early, I see him getting a stoppage win.
I'm glad we got to have crawford on all access before it leaves
Se dice no comas ansias don’t try to sell the fight mention Mexico man do your job first 🙄
Cmon give boo boo his jus due. Give him more time than this. Yall have to be balanced in yalls covering of fighters. Or we just going to thank yall rooting for 1 fighter. That's benavidez in this case
"Boo Boo" About To Beat 👊🏿🥊 David A**😁. Let's Go Boo Boo 💩🔥💪🏿🦁!
A true 50/50 fight and definitely ppv worthy fight out of all ppvs fights this this year.
I love the way David fights and he’s a very nice person
Andrade looks faster and more Athletic than Benavidez.
David is stopping him in ten rounds.
I always wanted to live off beating people up and getting paid for It, ive put in alot of work over the years but unfortunetly in México you cant always do It, you got to work to provide for your fam, i got amazed when this black dude at mayweathers gym wanted to box he was like 30 and had like 8 kids and he still had money left over and to train lmao, well damn.
Andrade will win this fight🤔💯
Boo boo 👻🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽 let’s go! Different Breed 🐕..PVD
That was dope!  Their relationship with their father seems beautiful.  I know life isnt as it seems looking in but, family is still nice to see
🔥 content...!!! Can't wait to see the fight..!!!
After this fight benavidez vs plant 2
Love it!  Boo Boo all the way!
I believe maybe 5-6 years ago Andrade would win this fight, he’s not the same fighter
This is gonna be another sweet one, Andrade been talking like he wants to show everybody that he has what it takes, so it's his time to shine - you can tell Andrade isn't scared - I need to watch this one too.
David’s just a different breed
Marquez a Canelo hater. 😆
Hey is he just carrying his belt because he won it before ?? Because he isn’t a title holder anymore right?? He was stripped ??
Jr was such as prospect man. I legit thought he was going to be p4p
Gonna miss All Access 😢😢😢😢
I cant waith to see this fight its gonna be good one.
Андраде, хитрый левша! Но Бенавидес хищник! Мощный, прочный, непрошибаемый! Молодой, голодный! Спасибо!
Benavidez is going to eat boo boo alive smh
Andrade will just run whole 12 rounds floyd mayweather style. 🏃‍♀️
7:00 Now we know who Marquez Favorite is.
I sense awkwardness in Davids marriage
This could go either way
The only one who could knock out çaleb plant has been canelo
Gr8 Promo! 🔥🔥🔥Man I’m going to miss Showtime Sports TV !!!
Boo Boo will lose under Andre Rozier idgaf what anyone says. He hasn’t won on a championship level in years.
I hope Andrade gives benavidez a beating. I don't really like benavidez he talks to much. And said he was going to knock out çaleb plant in the 6th round and can't even do it. And said if he gets the chance he'll knock out Canelo, plz don't make me laugh!!!!
I’m glad this fight his happening !  May the best man win
Great Fighters, Great Fight, Can't Wait...   🥊🥊
David’s wife is wayyyy prettier than Canelo wife.
He in the snac camp😳😢 it's gon be a fight fr😂
😂 Mannnn...WTH is up with u fellow Mexicans: in this comment section specifically, being so salty about Barrera-AND-JMM supporting David Benavidez; & @ the fact they favor him in a future, potential bout versus Canelo Alvarez?!? 🤔  Like it's such a weird ass dynamic going on. Yesss, I understand that Benavidez is a "Mexican AMERICAN"(& NOT FROM LAND/NATION OF 🇲🇽), but HE'S STILL OF MEXICAN BLOOD(DESCENT), NONETHELESS.! TF?! Bc it's looking hella divisive, OF SOME OF YA'LL, TBH... Which is highly usual & rare coming from ya'll, bc most of the time, u guys are typically well known for: sticking together AND supporting one another= having 💯(COMPLETE) UNITY.!
This is actually a good fight. Also who is the girl with the white in the beginning???
Damn im going to miss showtown boxing😢
Please don’t leavvve showtime
THIS GONE BE A CLASSIC
Imagine, Andrade beats Benavidez and Goes on to fight Canelo. "PAY DAY PAY DAY"
#Andrerozier #mikeveloz s/o too yall 12:17 💪 thanks for training the best of the best in boxing #andnew #andstill 14:11  #boobooandrade 🥊 #Ateam 🦈
Wow! When I clicked on this video it has 30,000 some views by the time I watched it its now 40,000 + this fight is growing
Just glad we got 3 biggest fight of 2023 Plant Vs David Davis vs Garcia Spence vs Crawford  Showtime will be miss
Hate to see Boxing leaving Showtime Sports, hoping Amazon can take it to new levels
Слава Богу! Здравствуйте! Очень интригует, интересное противостояние! Все козыри, тактико - технические показатели, на стороне Бенавидеса! Не буду загадывать, посмотрим! Спасибо!
Caint wait for David to fight this awkward style and see what he makes of it.
Andrade is a wild man.
I’m going to miss these all access episodes
Nah boo boo a right hand southpaw Benavidez finna win
I'm really gonna miss showtime, there's no there's platform this legendary
🇲🇽💪💯
Benavides you are not going to beat andrade...straighup...
Gonna miss all access. Go out with a bang showtime!
Benavidez can’t change his fire alarm battery
There's a reason why Ducknelo the 2x drug cheat disgrace to Mexico Alvarez has never had this much support from Mexico or Mexican legends.
Hijole Marquez y barrera ya no ay forma con morales después de esto
Winners gonna get Canelo🎉🎉🎉 2 guys that have been wanting the fight
Jesus loves you-!
This is a good fight stylistically but Andrade will win. Benavidez will be more humble and a way better fighter after this fight.
Benavidez by highway robbery
Don’t be surprised if Andrade gives Benavidez problems like Plant did in the first half of that fight.
Let’s hit them likes this is a must see fight
All access was what got me into boxing a lot when I was 12 years old
TEAM BENAVIDEZ 🥊
Monsta 🍑🍑
Monsta 🍑🍑
Boo boo was Highkey abused by his dad. Like yo, how are you going to be hitting your son with a belt because you don’t like how he his punching the bag?
para q gastan en esto si esta pela vendera 50k ppv
Man i duno why but ima near tears.. frfrfr!
Benavides is marquezs last hope to beat canelo. What's he gonna say after canelo takes him out too.
I've always felt sorry for Demetrius, because they duck him in every division. A champion should be getting challengers EVERYDAY. Instead they would change their trajectory.
😴 😴😴
I’m excited about this most since tc/es
I can't wait to sleep through that fight.😂😂😂
Bernavidez didn't look good fighting Plant wish him the best
I love Andrade as a person- he's corny af but he's also a cool mfkr. You can tell he's genuine and loyal to his family and friends. Benavidez is a tough fight. I couldn't call it one way or thr other I just hope Andrade get his gas tank ready bc David is Hella active and aggressive. I know Andrade is elusive but if his gas tank ain't right David gonna catch up to him.
Benavidez wife with a diaper lmao
David Benavidez real father is African American
David got it.
Once boboo starts feeling that power I promise y’all his guna fold
Marquez all wet talking to his boyfriend 😅😂
I can’t wait team benavidez
Booboo about to cook David
Does boo boo have a lisp
Skinny fat David
Despues de ver como sufrio David contra Caleb Plant. Pienso que el Bubu le va a ganar.
Andrade is goofy asf 😂😂😂😂 he's definitely going to get beat up bad!!!!!
Put on a good fight for us the fans
Andrade talks like he used to be a crackhead but has been clean for 5 years. Dude is odd lol
David benavidez it's going to school class in session
Marquez really hating on canelo 😭😭😭 Also David knocking out boo-boo in the middle late rounds
Its Boo time. Indigenous fighters shouldnt sign with showtime. Im happy Big Boo a free agent. Showtime yall suck
Should be a good one if Andrade can put some mustard on them shots
Fight of the year, im calling it now
Benavidez is definitely a Pacquiao fan😂, didn't want to talk to jmm
I always liked David. Very humble genuine man. But a killer. If you a real boxing fan you know this is going to be a great fight !
Well it's sad to see that Andrade is a dirty fighter and a drug cheat. That's a shame that he has to use performance enhancing drugs and before anybody tries to say that he's not the fact that he is tied in with Victor Conti & sponsored by SNAC is the slam dunk proof that him Crawford, Plant, Lopez, Haney are dirty Fighters also because they are sponsored by Victor Conte and his company SNAC. This man's only claim to fame is knowing how to beat drug test and the use of undetectable steroids. So why would a clean boxer associate their name with a known drug cheat and Drug distributor of performance enhancing drugs unless they are cheating if they were not they would not want their name tarnished by taking his money and his supplements because they don't need the sponsorship if their world class top name Fighters they make millions they do not need Victor Conte sponsorship they need his steroids and undetectable steroids his only claim to fame is his knowledge on passing drug test and undetectable steroids so why would his zma product which is zinc magnesium and B6 you can buy it at Walmart and do not need Victor to get it if it was so revolutionary of a product that all these boxers had to take it then it would have been flying off the supplement shelf to every muscle head in the United States or across the world but it is not some miracle vitamin combination. He is using this company and its vitamins as a front for steroid use and distribution. Every one of these guys named have connections to known steroid Distributors users or coaches that are involved or been caught with them in the past a clean fighter will do whatever it takes to keep their name from being muddied or slandered and doubt being put into fans heads if they are clean they would not want that to tarnish your career. Hate to see another dirty fighter hope he loses can't stand a cheater
Hats off to their dad. Takes a big person to admit his mistakes.
No matter what anyone says it’s a true 50/50 fight. The best and hardest fight of both their careers it’s a treat to watch can’t wait 🎉🎉🎉
This is a gonna be a classic to close out showtime. One for the ages. It's gonna be bitter sweet. I'm fans of both dudes and believe these are the 2 best guys at 168. The guys canelo ducked from 160 to 168. 3rd best is Morrell. 50/50 fight.  To all the casuals Andrade is the real deal. He hasn't got the recognition. I love both these guys, but something tells me Andrade is gonna outbox him benavidez. He has the length athleticism and pop to do it. It's gonna keep David honest.  He's just so unorthodox.
feel like andrade and aljo sound the same lol
Doo Doo and Charlo are taking the first Ls
Lets see the charla sisters spar
Even tho your half Ecuadorian , you should keep the Mexican monster nickname because it’s the Mexican boxers and Mexican fans who embrace you as their own , you are a part of Mexican culture don’t worry about who might feel bad about it your a champ from La Raza De Oro
Yo Jose Benavidez jr let’s goo bro iknow u can get that belt off charlo let’s gooo bro fuerza 🇲🇽🔥💯
Bro was fat for a year and a half and been training since 3 😂😂 boy stop it 😅
Hope Andrade gets the win let the best hombre win.
This dude has super fast hands and punches with bad intentions... Great Fighter.
I'll save you the time. Boo boo gonna hit and run all night. Benevidez gonna be the agresor so the judges gonna give it to him, but he's gonna look bad doing it because Andrade boring as hell. Boo boo gonna cry about being robbed but it's gonna be his fault for having that ultra defensive style that judges don't like.
espero sea un gran combate y gané el mejor...me parecen ambos buenos pugiles
Wrong again david.....Kelly palvik said you were gonna be champ 1 day
Amen
Jesus lives
Andrade is something different! Athletic gifted and awkward! Benavidez got problems💯 I got Andrade🥊👑
Always been a boo boo fan. However, the business of boxing always has the fix in. Unless booboo knocks David out, he will not get a decision. They are already looking past him for David to fight canelo. That's the money fight. I would love to see booboo win. I'm a fan of David too. However booboo has been chasing canelo for over ten years.
Glory to god
Besides canelo, I really wanna see benavidez fight bivol next year. That will be a great battle
Jesus lives
14:05 🤦🏻‍♂️💨
The end of a era showtime boxing will be missed
😂😂😂😂😂
"get the fxck out of here" Canelo
I like both of these guys. May the best man win and be in good health 🙏
0:17 cameraman getting all the shots😂😂😂 excited this is right on my birthday
Andrade is not ducked. He's just stupid.
The only one who did believe David was a future champ since back when he was a kid is eli setback
Showtime has done an amazing job with these all access episodes.
I can't wait 50/50 fight🥊
David's barber pushed his hairline back to the future 😭
Draw
Wet diaper ass BBL😂😂
Benavides is too fast for Andrade, and the condition of Benavides in every previous fight is obvious despite throwing so many punches!
Mexican Monster 👹 😈🇲🇽by KO
Big benavidez fan as I think he is a big part of the future of boxing, BUT booboo’s ring IQ and solid fundamentals are going to be too much for David. Booboo by points
Listen to David tryna say something all boxers haven't said, if you don't lose here, u lose to Big Charlo
Big up to Benavidez, I drive by his gym almost daily. This is going to be a great fight!
I literally went through 2 extremes when I clicked on this. One- was excitement, because I love ALL ACCESS features!  But then real dissapointment, because I remembered that come next year- - there is no more showtime. 🙁
I'm glad showtime boxing is done good riddance weak ass fighters all following the Mayweather route let's fight once a year against nobodies and act like we're the best bring back hbo fuck Al haymon
I think booboo gonna win,, I think the monster took the wrong fight
Thats right David The Ecuadorian Monster😤😤💯🇪🇨🇺🇸
Boo boo gonna win and rep Rhode Island!!!
Charlo belt aint even on for da benavidez fight
This is going to be a great fight!!
Ese Márquez como le arde que canelo sea la cara del boxeo 🤣🤣🤣

I boxed amateurs with my older brother and his best friend as a teenager up until about 2008. One of the trainers in our gym used to be a trainer in Andrades camp as well. At the time, Andrade was in the amateurs. We were in Mass, and I believe he was fighting out of Providence. Anyways, my brother and Steve, the trainer, would bump heads every once in a while. Eventually, Steve would always end up threatening my brother with, " You want me to get Boo Boo?!!! Do  You  Want me  To get Boo Boo?!!!". I didn't even know who he was at the time, but he made him sound like the boogeyman😂. So that's why im rooting for Andrade.    Also, my brother and his boy got to watch Andrade and Paulie Malignaggi spar. They said he lifted Malignaggi off his feet. At the time, Paulie was one of the best pros, so it was a big deal.
Sad to see SHO leaving, especially after they’ve put on such great fights this year. Started with Benavidez vs plant, then tank vs Ryan, bud vs Spence, canelo vs charlo, and now this fight. All bangers.
This is gonna be a good PPV card
Shout out to Floyd for starting all access and showing this side of boxing FIRST!
Benevidez family been putting on the best shows this year
David Benavidez Es el campeón.  David Benavidez is amazing. And I’m sure that he will do great against any competition.
UFC Countdown episodes are just as good and maybe better 👍
Andrade is almost untouchable every fight well see if benavidez IQ can break through wont be surprise if andrade pulls the upset at all
I am a fan of boxing and of Showtime. It is truly too bad that Showtime is leaving boxing. I am going to miss these All Access episodes and everything else about a Showtime boxing event. This should teach all of us boxing fans to buy all of the PPV fights and not to stream them. If we do not support the sport, who will? We must honor boxing so that boxing can continue to honor us. Enough said . . .
This gonna be fight of the year
Andrade viene subiendo de 160 libras y ya esta viejo tiene 36 años va a ganar benavidez el ventajoso abuzon 😏
David will wear Andrade down in the later rounds and win it. David is definitely built for the later rounds of every fight.
This will be the last fight on showtime with "All Acess"...🙆 Going to miss it ..
Its here 🗣‼️ And they fight each other (the monsters vs the two fist name’s hit man boo boo 💥. boxing’s GREAT right now 💣💣💣💣💣🎉
Team boo boo
Jr almost lost his eyeballs
Marquez and Barrera supporting Benavidez and even called him brother. Don't even do that for Canelo cause Canelo turned into a fake arrogant cocky punk that ducks real threats. David just wants to be the best by fighting the best.  Real Recognize Real
@ 24:04 VICTOR CONTE and the SNAAAAAAC Prograaaaaam- in full effect where Benevidez will lose this one now that this Undetectable pattern is unraveling itself
David is not Mexican but he Is a good fighter. Andrade is unknown because that's all he fights
Ya quiero mirar esta pelea de  dos 175 peleando en 168 libras pelean por quien es mas costal
ANDRADE IS COMING TO CLOSE THE BENAVIDEZ SHOW!
🇺🇸Demetrius Andrade 🇨🇻 🇨🇻Your time finally here🇺🇸       It's me again 😂
Wtf was that a Damn Bob Cat ? Almost gave Jose's face a few buck 50s ... Is that even illegal to have as a pet ...
Queen Elizabeth.. Muslim. Queen... ROFL this is her channel... ROFL not mine.. ROFL
I got fatboi on this one 👍🏾
Really really really sad we’re not going to get one of these videos when Canelo fights David
Andrade
#demetriusboobooandrade is something special, he is going to shock everyone
He wearing the "phoenix" trunks...I'm betting money on the Phoenix Suns to win the NBA chip 🏆 💍
Where is Jose Valenzuela????
That’s how you lift you’re bro up, shout out to David
good piece, it getting close to the end🥊
Lets go El Monstro Mexicano!!!! Do it for the Raza Carnal! Mexicans on top of the boxing world 🇲🇽🇺🇲🇲🇽🇺🇸
David’s wife thou😍 🎂
GYAAATTT
Both Mexico 🇲🇽 legends.
My guy David Benavidez the 🐐🐐
I remember rooting for caleb plant when him & benavidez fought not knowing much about him. After that fight i became a fan. Dude is a beast!
Yall can kill me for this but idgaf… I think it’s fake af that David Sr waited until the cameras were on the tell his son he loved and was proud of them
Jermall will beat both
Good luck to both fighters.  I think "Boo Boo" Andrade has more to prove than Benavidez....🤔 "Pops"#truschoolsports 🥊🥊
24/7 all access are the goats
Both of their styles are tailored made for each other….someone is gonna look very good in comparison to the other…only question is who??
Stupid to have a wild cat like that!
Her bbl is gross
Dat lady who was cookin fo David had a wagon
This dude is vicious,,,i don't think BooBoo gone make it,,,he better have enough power to keep him off,,,BooBoo is a good fighter but he has to much fun with this boxing shit,,I know he takes it serious but it doesn't seem like he do its like as if everything is a game to him
They want payday !!! 😂  #Canelo🥊
Marquez stay dreaming and having nightmares of Canelo 🤣, Lives rent free in his head
Definitely will miss All Access! I can see this fight being SD either way, or even a Draw...
Boo Boo in dis Bit
Marquez and barrera have such a weird obsession with canelo its crazy. They envy canelo, they hate his success and the fact that he's an international star. Something they, as great as they were, could not achieve.
This is the  weakest all access that I ever seen 🥱!!!!!
They don’t like canelo because he doesn’t like going into fights when he really feels like it’s a big threat like Mayweather did after he was on top and Mexican fighters don’t care they just want to entertain
A glad he’s taking boxing seriously and off the ❄️ he has a lot of talent. Should be a heavyweight tho 😂 Andrade is going to present him problems that’ll be interesting to see him have to overcome. Good lucc to both
Boo boo by decision is a back and forth slug fest.
Marquez calling just to hate on Canelo 🤦‍♂️😂
Andrade has been around for a good while. He has not been in the ring with a significant boxer.,  boo boo asks, why has he been shunned out for all these years…. It’s because no promoter feels confident that boo boos brash talk can translate into the ring. Canelo wasn’t going to waste his time with a no name or atleast a boxer who cant name a significant opponent that he’s beaten. I’m glad he will get his shot.. however Benavides will knock him out within 4 rounds.     Props to both fighters
I can't believe showtime boxing will be gone
See how David rides for his brother but fkn Mel be kickin Mal in the ass while he’s down!!! I hate that 🤦🏽‍♂️
I hope who's READING this💖a BLESSED L1FE.. I W1SH you an ABUNDANCE of SUCCESS, in Your NAME, JESUS NAME...AMEN✔✔💯💯
Honestly I like David but this gone really be his biggest test Andrade is a dog and he coming for the kill to be honest and not Bias I think Andrade gone win 💯💯💯💯💯
Bo Boo is with the snac program oh shit !! Lol 😂 I'ma Call TANK ☎️🦍🗣️💯🤣
Notice how all the legend wanna see the canelo vs Benavidez fight but canelo fans
Boo boo is huge lmao bro looks like he's 190
Want to hear a joke? The winner of this fight is still not guaranteed a shot at undisputed against Canelo. "something something something, Canelo can do what he wants" or whatever dumb crap Canelo fans say. Edit: Inb4 "bUt sEptEmBEr". Yeah we believe a liar that said he doesn't fight Mexicans. Sure.
Damn i thoght that was obama
Everytime i see Fake Nalgas 🤮🤮🤮
This PPV is going to sell hundreds and hundreds of buys!!
Baby got back
I pray HBO boxing returns since showtime is almost done. Man that's gonna be a sad day.
Canelos kid going to knock that little kids ass so bad
David loves hurting ppl 😂
DB lives in Seattle? Wtf😂
David better fix his footwork vs Andrade should be an interesting fight.
Two Mexican icons that are some hating ass dudes. Barrera and Marquez always talking down on canelo because Canelo passed them in everything. Hell even Chavez be hating. They lost my respect for that 🤨😒😤
It would be so dope if David moved to heavyweight and beat fury’s ass.  I know for a fact that if they were in the same weight class, David would wash fury. Fury is an overhyped piece of trash that plays a character.  Fury fights certain guys with certain styles to make himself look good like more than half of the new generation of boxers do today. They fight flat footed punching bags with a name.  Ruining the sport and brainwashing casuals
I like Andrade but you black folks on here make it real hard for me to root for him smh .. when it becomes racial I gotta rock with mine 💯🇲🇽
One last ride for Showtime!! 💯🥊🙏
tht was a wholesome moment "he's destined for greatness" "we both are"
I feel like I’m in a Time Machine and I get to see the bud and boots fight before it happens when you get to this echelon of fighting all of them deserve to be celebrated
Kelly Ppavlick said it first, David will be a future champ mark his words
Andrade seems cool, but he weird on camera lol
Benavidez math is off if you’ve been boxing since 6 then it’s been 20 years boxing not 23.
Fair well to showtime, Andrade going to take him to school
Benavidez is in the wrong weight class
50/50
The winner should get a shot at the titles at 168 which canelo have
W Cameraman
Si David Benavidez no es Méxicano barrera idiota
Si David Benavidez no es Méxicano barrera idiota
I will never understand people who get pets that aren’t pets. Anyway, why so little on boo boo, David took up like 25 mins outta 30 of that access.
I could tell this gonna be a boring fight
Benavidez is pure hype man.. he's no body man canelo is to much of a classy fighter touch for this guy he's a fan boxer just be people think he can beat canelo they just hate canelo they don't care about benavidez
Andrade can fuq anybody up he just not a finisher.
Man, the demeanor of Andrade is like the Charlo before the fight with Canelo. The confident is not there. I want him to win but….I think he is not
Kenny Bayless looked super  corrupt that plant benevidez fight. He was clearly given the assignment to protect plant from getting stopped
Bruhh he’s not Mexican stop with the Mexican monster 😂😂😂
The way David and his brother act around each other like they don’t really duck with each other.
La mejor cartelera del 2023 vamos a nokear mi Mexican monster!!!! Vamos Con todo menos con miedo!!!!
is this one getting a epilogue ?
Andre Rozier is over-rated.  He doesn't have a good championship record.
It sucks that this fight will be the last All Access since showtime is leaving boxing
I'll be ordering
Showtime will do 2 more ALL ACCESS for canelos 2 fights he has left. Face of boxing and king gets the highest respect 😤
It goes the distance demetruis andrade by split decsion. AND NEW🏆 wbc interim champion @168
Damn so does this only leave Dazn and ESPN left?
The last all access of showtime to end it with a good fight cmon Andrade prove everyone wrong 🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait, I wish other promotional companies did good episodes like these. Top rank hardly does this. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Juan manuel marquez ducked canelo . Se rajo marquez
8.9
When booboo retire he should join wwe i can see him being a champ over there he entertaining and has a good personality
Top Rank take notes..
50:50
Let’s go Boo Boo! Finally the world will see the real 👑
Boo Boo is far from being shot.. he still has his legs, reflexes, and punch output. David gonna get countered all night with his aggressive style.. gonna be a milder version of Bud vs Spence. You heard it here first!
The Baby Faced Assassin in the appropriate all black was a highlight.
Benavidez better not over look Boo Boo. I’m telling you that now!!!!
My heart is with David but my money is on his girl’s BBL FAST!!!!
How can y'all overlook Demetrius.. like for real!!!🤦
Your going to lose fool Andrade is only in for the money this clown aint gonna nothing special! Except get knocked out how this bozo had the belt for what 20 years with fighting nobody when someone good would be put in front of him something would come up and he wouldn't fight . There was a time when he was gonna fight billy joe saunders 5 or 6 years back and it didnt happen! Billy joe would have beat the breaks off this dude ! Back then so when he says oh canelo ducked me! Ok your one to talk fool
For a sec I thought he called him David Diabetes
I’ll say younger boo boo might win this guy right here now is rusty
Last all access ever? rip.
Dinero Fácil para Benavidez
David lost to caleb plant 😂
Canelo Scared of both of you
El camarógrafo como que no queriendo no se quedó con las ganas 😂😂😂😂😂
#itsmeagain #showtimeboxing #ppv #premierboxingChampions #Ateam #andrerozier #Snac #victorconte #Andthenew #andstill #Boobooandrade 🥊💯🙌🎆
❤
Snac promotion 😂😂 nope
The lil brother goin to get beat up easy! Big bro goin to take it out on Andrade! Thank me later
Interested in seeing how Andrade handles the pressure
This fight is gonna be 🔥
I got booboo 💯 but David he’s cool 😎
God Bless you both, Brothers Forever through Christ Jesus 👑 🦁 🦁
Andrade is knocking this dude out. He has never looked this sharp in years and he can fight. Miss me with that old age excuse none of you casuals were saying this shit when crawford prior to fighting spence.
all access just shine on whole different light on boxing man. smh
David is finna hand another loss to the black boxing community🇲🇽😈💪🏽
🔥🔥🔥
Damn Showtime. "How you gonna act like that." 🎶 (Tyrese). Towards us. We're gonna miss All Access. 4real tho.
*I'd like to thank David for taking this fight but November 25th him & his brother losing the same night. 33-0, 27-1 coming soon!*
Im going for Benavidez, but I also like Andrade. May the best man win.
I see people saying Benavidez stoppage. If he couldn't stop Plant he not stopping Boo Boo. It's levels to this.
Crazy thing is I can knock out benevidez
Damn this such a 50/50 fight . Could go either way
W for 👹El Monstro👹
Boo-boo awkward af
*Damn they done dropped this while I was watching it live 😂. Showtime can y'all please drop the Andrade Willie Nelson fight before y'all leave boxing! 🙏🏽*
BooBoo is gonna shock the world.
The black fighter will win
Let’s go BooBoo!
They at the start wanted to show that fake Kim.. Wow.. Eggs 😂
What a way to go out for showtime boxing with one last great fight in 2023
Marquez speaks to David but not to canelo??
Andrade for the upset.
Im gonna miss Showtime vids. Like you wouldn't believe.
Going to be sad not seeing all access after showtime’s departure from boxing. Enjoy it while it last fellas 🥊
I got Benavidez. But Andrade pulling off the upset wouldn’t surprise me at all. I’ve been critical of Andrade’s resume. But he gets a lot of props from me for taking a fight against David Benavidez. Win or lose
Damn crazy how this is gonna be the last All Access ever 😔
lol David Benavidez cant do any videos without canelo being brought up
You can tell that the Mexican boxing legends of Barrera and Marquez revere to Benavidez than the overrated Canelo.   I know that many Mexican fans are gravitating to Benavidez and eventually Canelo will have no choice but to fight him.
Winner better get canelo. No excuses. Best Vs the best in the division.
I got the Mexican monster by TKO
BooBoo DooDoo
Props to BooBoo for fighting the guy everyone don’t want smoke with.
Dude couldn't even knock out Plant so don't compare him to Canelo.... There's levels
Boo Boo gone outbox em
This fight could go either way. But I think Benavidez beats Andrade by decision.
I love them both Awe Benny vs Boo boo🔥🔥🔥🥊🥊🥊Shoutout to All Access 🗣️🗣️
I'm going to miss this when showtime Boxing is gone
Two of canelo’s worst nightmares getting it on😈😈. May the best man win🥊
To easy for Benavidez
I ❤ All Access! The narration, the production value, the best!
Let’s go I don’t mind either winning stream Lil Deno I’m also and amateur boxer
Benavidez by UD speed,youth & power out classing the older awkward Andrade 🥊
andrade in 12 401⚓
This is what to be a good fight
Should be a good dust up!!!!  The long, unproven Andrade vs the alleged Mexican Monster in Benavidez.
Long Time Coming... Let's Goooo BooBoo!!!!
David by knock out 7 rounds
Benavidez by stoppage in 10th rd
First
