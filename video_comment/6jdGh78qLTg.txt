iPhone 26 will come with Apple A26 chip this year.
This is Windows 7 style, not attractive.
No big deal update
I bought an apple 14 pro max they said this device was IP68 and someone splashed me with the phone in my hand. Now the phone dont work and apple said their warrant does not cover this when it clearly states IP68 cover water for 3m for 30 minutes. Mine was not under water. Someone just splashed me.  Now the device dont power on and apple support says there is nothing they can do. bs!!!  This is a scam!!!
@Sajid Ali 786
Apples design language is getting worse and worse. Bring back Jony Ive
I’m still on iOS 16 just don’t like 17 or 18
Welcome to AERO glass you're using windows Vista 😂😂😂😂
you dont need this its trash. dont give your money to them. buy something with no batteries
Old iPhone is the best
At first when i saw titles on YouTube saying “ios26 sneak peeks “ i was like yea those r prob just predictions for 10 years from now but nope!
Cook will resign by end of 25.
Apple stocks are tumbling. Shareholders not happy. What Apple must do to avert this crisis.
Kind of seems like Apple might be cooked. They made such amazing devices and efficient powerful chips but Siri is unusable and this new UI looks like windows vista. They’re years behind now
So... Aero Glass for iOS?  The only noteworthy thing about these updates are the Phone and Journal Apps for macOS.  I actually think the UI update for WatchOS is probably a bigger deal than the iOS one... which isn't really that big of a deal to me (ignorable, in the grand scheme of things).  At least they are unf-cking the Photos app.
I will wait
It's great that iOS is catching up with version 26, but let's be real, many of these 'new' features have been on Android for a while. The ability to circle anything on your screen to search it has been on Samsung and Pixel phones for some time now, and getting a live, translated transcript of your phone calls is a hallmark Pixel feature. Glad iPhone users can finally start enjoying some of Android's powerful tools!
"aNdRoId UsErS hAvE hAd AlL ThAt SiNcE 2001"... That shit is washed. We don't care, go play on your trash device. I've never owned anything other than iphone and I will never switch. Waste your time elsewhere.
I don’t no yet
Why is it called iOS26 as being released in 2025 would have thought it would be iOS25
I remember when I had my iPhone 4, I updated my phone to the new update they released and it wiped all my photos and all that, I lost everything, they didn’t have the save to cloud back then, after that happen Apple brought out iCloud and it saved so much trouble, I’m glad they have improved to what it is today, I love apple products
me watching this on my crappy android
They lied about the Apple AI with the 16's, they have lost my trust.
Only if smoke and mirrors still works! The word 'upgrade' is doing a lot of heavy lifting for Apple!
"New" features 😂 when all this already existed on old Motorola/Android phones with  Google services.
Is there any change regarding multitasking? Any split view? Any slide over?
Apple is no comparison with Huawei’s innovations!
Yes I have already downloaded the new iOS 26 version  not sure if I like it or hate it yet . I will tell you it is kind of buggy right now but yes to be known as first beta
Apple is so outdated its not funny
*FYI* Ya can’t do developer beta if ur under 13. You can do it for Public Beta though.
Welcome to 2007, Apple!
Yawn. How about a more intuitive keyboard and number row? Something ALL users would benefit from multiple times a day.
what about battery 😂😂 battery would drain like nothing
My new iPhone 16E already gets so hot using certain apps, I get heat related alerts.  With so many IOS26 things running in the Subsystem resident, I’m betting my iPhone will be running hot all the time.  So not a fan of IOS26.
goodbye #iphone 👋🏻
ew 😂
Feels 💩
I want to be respectful and constructive here. I almost posted a really negative post but I’ll simply say I know it’s been a difficult time for the company, there wasn’t really much of any upgrade this year. It was more so a redesign, and in my opinion as a designer And them taking away your option to use old designs, it was a downgrade in my opinion. However, my favorite feature was customizable folders. That I’ve been waiting for for over a decade. I finally don’t have to overwrite the folders and design them myself in Photoshop and change permissions to rewrite the file icon! That’s a valuable upgrade! I think more changes like this and the updates they made to shortcuts as well are the kinds of changes we need. Also wish they would bring Apple Intelligence to older devices since I can’t even use half of the features they advertised.
All the presenters in wwdc25 lacked any excitement.
A developer conference for a UI theme and icon pack 😂😂😂😂 at this rate the iPhone 20 will be a Nokia flip phone 😂😂😂
looks like one of those bad free icon packs you used to get on Android
I hope my phone doesn’t burn every two minutes 😭
Will all this be visible outdoor considering transparency
This ui is absolutely disgusting. 🤮 12 yr Apple veteran here going to Pixel 9 pro now.
Great video! Thanks 😊
Apple: “and then we fixed photos-“ Me: “SOLD, I don’t need anything else, risky beta downloading this immediately!”
Sorry this is Apple making the system bigger to force everyone to buy more modern phones and create sales.. - like win 98 going to XP... lots of high graphic eye candy but poor substance and minimal improvements
The glaze is real here. This is a small update considering the iOS specific changes were fewer than any device other than watch and the GUI is amateur at best.
Looks like a Huawei UI
Wait, what year is it?
Ah yes, the Liquid Glass update - because what the world really needed was see-through buttons and rounded corners reacting to your eyeballs like it’s a damn lava lamp. Apple out here selling vibes instead of features. 'Unified naming'? Wow, thank God, now Grandma won’t think she skipped seven iOS versions. iOS 26 finally lets icons match dark mode - groundbreaking stuff, folks. Next year: apps that open when you tap them! And don’t get me started on 'Genmoji' - custom emojis? Great. Just what we need, Chad sending AI-generated eggplants with personality disorders. Apple Intelligence? More like Artificial Insecurity - Siri still can’t set a timer without having a stroke. Every year they take macOS, slap it with some iOS duct tape, and go, 'Look! Innovation!' Meanwhile, I just want my Mac to not spontaneously overheat from opening Notes. But hey, at least now I can resize a window on the iPad without triggering a spiritual crisis.  10/10 marketing, 3/10 substance. Classic Apple
Nothing innovate it at all.
It looks good though.
truly looking forward to see how the new photo app will function
Also, thanks for getting the video out so quickly
I wish they would have changed the app icon shapes, but other than I think it will be good if Apple carries out their promises
It’s enough to get me excited😮
iPhoneX以降は何も進化していません
Nice one!
so, apple has decided to skip iOS 19 and jump to 26 in hopes of catching up with android just to still be behind 🤔
Finnally apple is getting features that Android havin6feom more than 10 years😂😂😂😂
Something no one is talking about… gesture bar at the bottom is gone for the most part finally
I can’t Make up my mind, which one I’m impressed with more the eye candy or  all  the yet to be discovered bugs🎉
readability disaster...
Imagine if airdrop worked every time
Probably STILL no number row for the keyboard. 4:29
maybe apple has different meaning by what they mean "BIGGEST"??
the biggest upgrade he say??????? BIGGESTTTTTTTTT???
But they still didn't fix SIRI. 😂😂😂
I don’t like the fact that they didn’t make the icons more round like the concepts showed.  That’s a big disappointment.  They are becoming stale and the much more circular icons could’ve helped revamp and refresh it further.
No thanx. I only install the final version. 1:14
Ngl I hate it I'd say ios 15 was the peak and perfected till ios 18 it felt like apple but ios 26 is like just not apple
My prediction: this WWDC marks the beginning of the end for iPad. They added so many Mac features that a couple years more of this they will be indistinguishable. I bought an iPad not to have a Mac. I don’t want a Mac.
Apple may have actually killed iPhone with this....
How do i get it
I don't care about a new look, I want the existing features to work properly and without so many issues. On top of that I would like to have a dictation feature, which is on par what I can get with any other AI. Apple's dictation sucks.
I truly hope that now other smartphone brands don't just copy this style. Not because I don't like, however I eant variety and different solutions on the market.
So they are not acknowledging that Siri and Apple intelligence are a joke.... in 2025.
Shout out to the butcher brown song 0:45
If you think this is a big deal, wait till you see what Huawei is launching. 😂
No iPhone 17 announcement??
For f*** sake pls stop saying basically in everything. It’s annoying. Rest of the content is cool
So basically a 3 year old Android OS, got it.
iPhone 17 same as lipstick on a piggy
YOU LIED
W apple for listening and changing the photo app back to the way it was. I fucking HATE the new photo app layout
Ios26 is garbage
So nothing new again!! Big surprise lmao 😂
It’s definitely not optimized. Pretty laggy. Can’t wait to see it cleaned up
Boring
This honestly gives Sony vibes
Same bullshit people have had enough of apple
Very pretty design and most Android features. Cool.
Tim is so COOKED.
So they wanted it to look like a cheap third party Android launcher from 2017?
All they did was make em transparent? Y’all are acting like they did something crazy lol we had this back in the day during the jailbreak Cydia days
How about android 26..-used phone android 😮
So cycling ugly the glass
I really hope the liquid glass aesthetic improves and refines because, as is, it’s a freaking eyesore. I hate it. It could have been so beautiful and still could be but no. It’s on my test iPhone 16 Pro Max and it’s worse in person. It needs to change or we need an option to dial back the whole look to something more flat.
Give us an e-ink iphone and I’ll buy it instantly
“This is the biggest IOS update since xyz” they say this every year and yet they feel more underwhelming every year 😭
I had information overload! Way to much to process(pun intended),, videos like yours are a big help!
I used to run public betas on an old phone. I always waited until a couple hot fix updates were pushed out before I would update to the next beta version. So for this beta release, instead of installing iOS Public Beta 26.0, I would wait for either 26.0.1 or 26.0.2. Those hot fixes usually fix any major bugs or glitches that are reported.
I watch all of the live presentation until they started talking about the iWatch What I saw was impressive I might even get excited about 26!
I was very disappointed.
Yet no update on the keyboard we need a number row!!!
Reminds me of frutiger aero
Horrible
I'd never download a new iOS to an older phone. It'd slow down your phone significantly.
I have it on my phone already. Simply love the feel.
Basically basically.. is all I heard
This whole event is a joke. They are literally rolling out shit that jailbreaks gave us years ago.
Can’t trust news from a red mic… just saying
Arent we on ios 18?
animated artwork doesn't work
Holy shit this is basically vista aero I’m not an Apple fan boy but no doubt company’s are gonna use this as their next software design remember it was Apple that did minimalistic first then everyone else did
I dont see it
I’m not impressed it direct feel like a major redesign.
Some of these features have been on android for years. Why do people bother anymore
Sorry but the control centre looks so cheap
Yeah whole design overhaul my ass barely anything is gonna change if they atleast give people the option to choose rounded apps if they want would make the update a little less depressing
Gayos26
i like it
Remember when Windows 7 had a transparent UI? 🤌
I honestly don't understand why anyone would think iOS is flawed or broken. it is what it is and works superbly and flawlessly well within the Apple ecosystem. I don't give a rat's hind quarters what any other gimmicky company is doing out there because I don't and will never use Crapdroid because it's the Window's of Phones. The most widely used iOS due to all the different brands and models of phones that run on the Droid system, but as varied as the plethora of phones running android, many versions of Droid out there and many do things slightly differently that others.  I'm still rocking my 13 Pro Max and it works as well today as it did 4 years ago when we bought all 6 of ours.  When we upgrade not will most likely be to the 17 next spring, one the hype dies down a tad and AT&T offers us the same free upgrade deal they're offering us now on the 16. The ONLY thing I'm not happy about the 17 is the fact no more Ti.
Bring back iso6 look!.
Oh so we going back to Windows Aero days, like what now 10+ years ago!?
The world complained 10 months since WWDC 2024. Yes, Apple changed all OS NAMES but that’s easy/fast.  Apple changed the GUI, but that’s superficial change.  A few new FEATURES sprinkled.  But after 1 year of FAILED AI promises to 90%, Apple again has delayed most of the ai. ISteve once said “competition flummoxed” but he’d turn in his grave and would fire lots of staff as Apple is truly flummoxed and Apple under Tim Cook is cooked to have overpromised & underdelivered as never before in Apple history!  WTF Apple, you DEFIED multiple technological disruptions over 4 decades, but since iSteve 2011, Cook, chosen by iSteve, though took AAPL from $1B to $3T, put all eggs in 1 basket, the China risk Factor, then did not innovate for 14 years(!!), losing its MOJO (DNA/genes), focused more on LGBTQ/woke rights/demos/emoticons/walls/rainbows, than do his due diligence even, not realizing multiple departments including siri/ai did not deliver for over a decade?!! Apple under iSteve did not get Kodaked/Polaroided/Nokiad/IBMed/Blackburried etc., but, how will Apple survive when all its devices depend on ai, an ai it does not have?  Tim COOK is cooked. Should be fired. Would have been under iSteve, even if he initially chose him. Cook fell asleep of did not have any vision, no mojo, no creativity. He missed the China Factor Syndrome. Missed the AppleCar. Missed the SmartHome market. Missed the iWatchCam. Missed Gen ai. Missed aiDevice. Too many mistakes to keep helm/job. Missed Siri! How could he or other managers not realize Siri did not improve so lonnng?! Why pay the Siri head so much so long, it’s as if he was hire from Goo to sabotage Apple’s efforts!  Ai shifts every quarter in big jumps. It’s now over 4Q, Apple is still way behind. Goo f’d up ai until a year ago, now are ahead, fixing it in 1 year, but Apple in that same year did not improve ai, only surface stuff. Why? Apple has enough funds, staff, resources, how did they screw up?  Can Apple survive: 1. without ai in all iDevices? 2. without Jony Ive/OpenAI-like aiDevice? 3. without at least an ai device surpassing Jony Ive’s, a 3D spatial ai device? 4. without anything new/unexpected/surprising at WWDC25? 5. without its own aiOS/software/features instead of depending on 3rd party ChatGPT / Perplexity? WWDC25 did not even mention Goo Gemini, so was it a false rumour or is the deal not or implementation not yet ready?  If Jony Ive left Apple in 2019 after 27 years since 1992, and had a $100M deal to keep designing for Apple, why did Apple or Tim never buy his stuff and is that why Jony did not sell the aiDevice/hardware to Apple but OpenAI? How did iSteve’s wife Laurene Powell, become a traitor to iSteve’s baby, Apple, by supporting the future of tech, through Jony’s aiDevice for OpenAI, that could kill Apple, replace its mojo of disruptive/humanized tech, kill Apple’s chance of survival?  Too many questions/doubts, perplexing lack of will/vision from Apple. They went from pro user to consumer to iterations to bloatware. From genius to normal. From exciting to banal. If nothing’s special anymore, it’s dead.  What can SAVE Apple? An internal or outsider CEO? Should Jony Ive not be it? Would he? Who else in the world has the genius, knack, creativity, iQ, eQ, & tyrannical vision, to LEAD, not follow?
Smartphone innovation has hit a brick wall.  Time to focus all energy on AR/VR.
iOS 18-26? Hell naa
Will it be available on an iPhone 15?
No thanks!!  I’ll stay on iOS 18, I am currently using an iPhone 14 PM and it will be my last iPhone…I am not going to fuel their delusions since they can’t count…
So no circle icons just clear🫠
So it's windows aero? From Windows 7?
Downloaded on phone already. It looks even better than what’s in the keynote.
How do we do the messages background
I never signed up for the developer beta only the public beta but im able to download ios 26 ?  Maybe they are the same thing
You’ve been warned…. It’s terrible UI
Oh dang I missed the camera app redesign
Can’t wait to chug some liquid glass
You said “basically” 25 times. It’s all I could hear.
Its probably the worst update ever nothing new cool things just shitty glass. Where is my split screen and where is my multifunctional clipboard
Seriously underwhelming keynote.
The liquid glass seemed like windows vista aero back in 2007
dawg that name thing is just like what happened with twitter but without it being sold!   the UI is cool but the name… yeah… DEFINITELY NOT!
Transparrent dock is back👍
Close enough. Welcome back frutigier aero ❤❤🎉🎉
This is the most shit I have ever seen no wonder they disabled the comments apple has lost innovative appeal a long time ago
All this shit and you still can’t change your font! 🙄
I got iOS26. No big issues so far. Took an hour for my iPhone 15 Pro to configure the new OS. It was REALLY laggy during that time
Looks useless where is functionality
I was really excited for delivery on a better operating system for the iPad, making it more of a computer like experience. I didn't see that in the video. Did that get done or did that not happen? Pretty disappointing if they did not do that.
I do like some of the design choices and a couple of the new features, but I don’t think I would ever describe this as a radical redesign
Straight iOS 26 😂😊
they did the camera icon reall dirty
I am already on devloper beta  it's smooth 😊
so just a worst one ui 7.
Any RCS improvements?
Looks like Windows Vista.
What about round icons
I have and Se and I'm not sure whether I should get it due to the fact that all the ui changes aren't made for that type of model (with homebutton)
I hope they fix the dynamic island bug at last but overall it's better than I expected after all those rumors
Apple started gaining traction at a time when Nokia was dominating the global market — and now Nokia is practically gone. Unfortunately, Apple seems to be heading down the same path. There's no real innovation that keeps up with today's rapid tech developments. Their latest event was very underwhelming and lacked any significant breakthroughs. Even in the AI race, Apple seems to have fallen behind. Just look at Huawei — in less than a year, they've made a massive leap in development, both in hardware and software, literally across the board.
Here me out, Frutiger Aero is back!
Man you shoulda shared those Cheetos with me, I can see them red fingers 😂
Can’t say I really care much about this redesign just meh
Everyone being so hyped gor no reason. It’s a pretty minor update except for the design and even that is just ios7 but with glassy effect
Apple really groundbreaking with transparent icons. Meanwhile batteries last 30 mins on a full charge
OMG IOS 27..... looks like IOS 26,25,24,23,22,21,20 and on and on.
Wait... Why's it called iOS 26?
Same bullshit same icon & same screen
I am glad they are bringing back the glass look and making things not as flat. Some of the features sound great.   But I was hoping for more. It’s still iOS7 with a fresh coat of paint. I was hoping for a complete redesign of the icons to put life back into them. I never was a fan of Jony Ives flat design that we’ve had since iOS 7. I preferred iOS 6 (probably in the minority there). I was also hoping for a redesign of the OS controls, like bringing back a home button at the bottom and adding a system back and app switcher button like in Android. And I heard that apps would have settings built in instead of going to the Settings app to control individual app settings. Is that coming?   It’s a step in the right direction. But I was hoping for more.
How to make iPhone to look like Xiaomi. Absolute disaster
I don't think I could negatively criticize what Apple have delivered today on WWDC. Every new and upgraded feature will add some satisfying and useful experience to the Apple eco-system.
Innovation in the smartphone world passed with Steve Jobs unfortunately. We’re ALL still using his design from 2007 minus the home button lol..
6:22 I've thinking for a long time now for the creation of a movie watching experience where two people at geographically separation location can watch a movie together via WhatsApp or other live streaming app. As it's demo in this point in the espisode timeline, a floating miniature video of the person on the other end of the line (video call), and a floating video of yourself on their end of the live video call. And whenever anyone on the line speak the movie will pause temporarily until everyone is silent again. All this activity will happen on your phone or tablet or even your laptop, if the live video calls can occur. In this way couples can watch movies together, while seeing a live floating video of their partner face, in a miniature floating video, as demonstrated in this point (6:22) of the timeline in this episode. You will be watching the movie together while the floating video of both of y'all, will be running simultaneously on both of y'all phone screen (despite being at different locations). It's kinda how video game is played online but just that this is totally different in this scenario. This new idea of mine is entirely unrelated to what is being discussed in this episode, but I thought that using the demo of the Apple Ad can fully explain what I think will be a game-changer for the near future. A time where long distance video call can be revolutionary and exhilarating. I honestly believe software engineer should consider it and create this new feature that can be a game-changer.
Am I risking something if i update to the beta? And will the battery be worse ?
iOS 26 is a gamble: just like iOS 18
I think they’ve got one thing Siri
I jave iphone 13 pro max where is my update guys tell mee 😒
So I did use iOS 18 beta and everything works fine so I’ll install iOS 26 beta too and hope for the best
So windows vista/7 basically
Nothing interesting here
Why are we skipping 19-25?!
Might be time to jump ship soon. Apple seems stagnant.
It’s not here
Adding 1 feature it will be groung breaking supports for who those use their phone hands free is when ur voice call connect it will be feedback by vibrate signal its very help full
I’m not excited. All superficial improvements. I guess I’m just spoiled with higher expectations than I should.
The liquid glass actually looks amazing. But I care more about what the back of the phone is going to look like
Still No split screen? 😔
your voice sounds like those annoying fake game ad, I was scrambling for the SKIP button so fast 😂
Downloading it right now
I thought we’d finally have split screen 😢
Finally after all these years, the redesign I've been waiting for!
Omg it’s so ugly
For my 3 year;s old iPhone 12 :)
This is why i am staying alway from this iOS 26 beta 1 testing :)
This is trash iPhones still I mean still can’t do true multitasking iPhone 17 sales will be just as bad as the iPhone 16 horrible just horrible
I was exited for circular icons but I knew it wouldn’t be possible without all 3rd party app makers redesigning their app icon look only for iOS
Windows 7 Aero 😂
They used apple intelligence in many places and all looked non gimmicky
Gives me Windows 7 vibes
LOL these features are so laughable in front of s25 ultra - glad I switched
Apple is Bad. Very bad
Amazing presentation!!!!!! So excited for the dev beta releases!!!
What happened to the previous ones
Will we be able to closse all tabs not slide each one?
So BASICALLY?!
Just slight visual tweaks. How is this as big as IOS 7’s update, it’s not even close
Why is the design illegible in places and terribly overshadowed? Otherwise it looks interesting.
Very lazy design but still better than last year.
can i  get it on iphone 13
YouTubers: “This update will be as big of a change as iOS 7”
Windows Vista
“This is one of, IF NOT THE BIGGEST, updates…” Wait until you download the beta.  It is literally the least they could do.  SMH.
since when did we get to ios 26?
Still shit mate
BASICALLY  drink everytime he says "basically."  oops drunk already
This looks absolutely terrible - it will be a nightmare to read text I am sure - and just tacky. We need Jony Ive  back!!
The design is THANK GOD so much better than these horrible leaks
THIS SHIT IS STUPID. WWDC and Apple LACK of intelligence is conformation that I made the right choice to switch to Android this year. iOS 26 we got clear icons and backgrounds please buy an iPhone 17... what's that? the AI features we promised with the 16?? Ohh those are coming with the iPhone 18 or maybe 19 but forget about that, clear icons am I right?
Visual intelligence is like Samsung circle except you have to take a screenshot 😅
Already in Developer downloading mode iOS 26, MacOS 26, WatchOS26. Let's hope for the best.
what a HUGE disappointment… what’s going on with apple?! they’re falling behind in everything, even the visual changes were just so… meh
The most beautiful gorgeous OS I’ve ever seen
I think it's definitely  like a coat paint over the flawed issues apple has really IMO  been slacking lately I was using iphone  for many years and about 3years ago I switched even though  my family has all ios devices and apple needs  to step it up because right now andriod 15 is really amazing and very stable how ios used to be
Hope it isn’t Vista younger cousin …. 😂 Winterboard 2012 …  Lipstick on a piggy 🐷 I have an iPad I’ll likely play around on with it.
14.4GB for iPadOS?  Damn!
Don't care about all this in between stuff... Waiting on the iPhone Fold.. that's it.
Personally instead of new glitchy designs and etc. I need the existing features work stable without so many bugs
Yes ! 😊 The real iOS is back
I not see the app file conecting whith the iPhone for restore. To much people not have MacBook and wee need the possibility restore iPhone whith the iPad
Nothing changes
I'll wait to see if Apple steps up the game with the iPhone 20. iPhone 12 is still serving the purpose.
speaking of dramatic entrance
I don't have it yet because I'm in UK
liquid ass !
I want to get the iPhone 17 Pro and how is the new iOS supposed to save the iPhone 17 series the 17  should sell well because most people skipped the 16
What Apple is doing is just ridiculous. Where is the HRV in the vital? Thought it will be taken into account in the future.
I'm in the beta program and its still shows IOS 18
they gave ios a new theme thats it .. ill be sticking to ios 18.. what a disapointment !
Get ready if you think iOS 18 was bad you all are in for a fucking shit show
decorating your house with apple widgets with your apple vision pro is crazy
all that redesign and still the same ass keyboard..... is it too much for apple to just make a full feature keyboard with a number row and ,  and . on the main panel like gboard so you can type with less taps.... I dont understand how its so hard for them
Copying Samsung Huh..?
I can’t believe how disappointing WatchOS update.
They might have “fixed” photos, but they made the tabs asymmetrical 🤒🤕 😵😫
bringing pixel features to iphone, nice
Who gives a s%&$???
Oh, I'm definitely not going to update to iOS 26, is iOS 26 like a bad joke?
So neumorphism
trash nobody needs or wants 3d glass bs how hard is it to give people the option to change the garbage icons and dull colors they have had forever
So from 18.5 to 26 in one shot…😮
It was boring zZZZzzzZzz
The things that I will value most are the new controls for the camera and the updated photos app.  The previous one left me scratching my head and asking how Apple could release something so confusing.  But I'll probably hold off until IOS 26.1 is released just to reduce the chance of bugs in the initial release.
Certainly liked the iPad OS 26 and will definitely upgrade my Air to iPadPro M5 when released.  Definitely most of the leaks were spot on and covered most of the new features.
curently backing up then beta time
I saw nothing that impressed me.
5:50 lmao that bug
Every year when an IOS is announced they say “ this is one of the biggest and best iOS ever” that sentence is getting annoying. Find something else new to say.
Apple again, making such a big deal out of a few visual tweaks. Apple used to be great innovators of bringing out new things it’s like they’ve run out of ideas.. must admit the iPad multi windows is a good upgrade.
So lickable...
kind of wish they brought back the old glass look from before ios 7
I'm going to let the stock speak for itself.
Has the “Books” app been refreshed? I use it a lot and I kind of want to see how it looks like now.
"Hey ChatGPT, give me something that sounds futuristic, wet, and overpriced." —"Liquid Glass." —"PERFECT. Sell it." what a joke
I have to say I’m already tired of liquid glass. I think the movie titles is what did it for me.
I hate that time expanding crap on the lock screen, can I turn that off?
HAHA ANDROID CLONE
The beta is out now.
No round icons?! That was biggest thiing i was waiting for
What a waste of time, no big changes, new stuff that on Android is there since ages ago, the new icons "transparent" style looks old and ugly (to me). Disappointed as usual, Apple is becoming boring as hell.
Where are the round icons Apple and what happened to the home OS !!!??
Why did they jump to 26?!😂
People, by this time you are now able to download the iOS26 they have been uploaded.
No new home app, no new stage manager , no battery notification,Apple TV still sucks. I am not sure whom apple listen to where they say the most required feature over and over during the keynote !
So exciting. The biggest iphone design change ever, aka "Glass Theme" from Android 20 years ago.
But we don’t have circle icon as likely the rumors said
So no round icons?
I actually wanted the round app icons, even as just a customizable option
This new design makes some things looks really difficult to read, and the control center looks messy with no structure.. I like the intentions, but it's not well implemented.. the backgrounds are too visible.. this UI will be extremely hard for a new user to get used to.. even to me it looks chaotic visually
Jony Ive ruined everything for like 12 years and now we are back to what we had before
Looks ugly! I was planing to buy iPhone later this year.
Please dont tell me this will be forced i like my icons how they are
Aero is back
Still no multitasking and zero mention of a better Siri 😒
Yes, as soon as it lets us
How do you get 26 today?
No split screen?
So all the rounded icons talk was nothing🤔
What time beta drop ?
I couldn't help but notice that, while they talked about Apple Intelligence quite a bit, they didn’t mention Siri AT ALL!
This is the most meh OS increment ever. This might have just given me the final push to return to Android after 4 years.
In other words, more stuff to disable in order to get the same amount of battery life as before.
It’s alright, but I would have preferred a completely new icons and app design, after all, it’s still iOS 7 with glassy effects.
Só are we Devs accounts get the ios 26 today?
It no good at all
You can’t get the beta software “Right now for free” … developers beta isn’t free  CORRECTION! NOW IT DOES LET ME DOWNLOAD THE DEVELOPER SOFTWARE! THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE
Nintendo is basically copying Apple iPhones and it’s just pathetic these companies don’t wanna even listen to their own customers anymore and realize that if you keep on downgrading and getting rid of buttons  or features that people like and then charging a lot more money for it some people are going to continue to buy it but some people are gonna say yeah no I’m gonna skip it and yeah these companies don’t want to even learn it’s just like Hollywood as well with these mistakes they keep on not caring their customers at all instead of they are trying to reach the Ulta rich.All these companies are out of touch these days
I actually like the look of the new iOS.
Looks shit
How did bro uplaod this so quick!!
Looks like this update is gonna destroy battery life.
It’s the macOS clipboard manager coming to iOS too ??
all the excitement was useless… and i already knew
How do you get 26 today?
I watched it when does it kick off?
They are so far behind the AI race that this new Ios seems more like a smoke screen than anything else. I still can´t believe that Apple allowed this to happen while other companies like Google, Microsoft and Meta to mention a few, are at the top of what is the new revolution.
I watched it when does it kick off?
iOS looks good, but no way I'm installing the beta version.
Too little too late!
Going the way of Microsoft. Lipstick on a pig mode, no new real features.
Lipstick on a pig
Will iOS 26 come to iphone 17 base model or will the baseodel run on iOS 18?
0:00 I thought this was the coffin dance😂🚡💀😭
Liquid Glass 🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡
Glad Apple brings back the lovable Aqua ui and transform it to the liquid glass
Ngl, I like the new texts and translations and screening scam calls features. Oh and live translation has potential but may need some changes in the near future.
iOS 26 is now a clone of Windows Aero from 10 or 11  years ago.
Dang
Bro when did you shoot and edit this? You posted before the stream ended 😅
bruh i just finished this stream from start to finished, and you already posted bruh-
Apple TV need more stuff
Man I love IOS26, that was pretty awesome. Very clean look and very exited to try out the beta.  Edits: the rumors never came close to what I just watched. Rumors just made the new redesign lame.
bro the stream's still going on and u already posted lol
I actually am watching it on my tv
