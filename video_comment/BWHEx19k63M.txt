34:11 imagine u airball nd yo teammate get dropped😭
This title cap!! These dude is NOT the best team.
BJ is underrated
30:36 That hesi step in, step out was clean. Got his defender off balanced.
I wanna see bj vs moon
They gave thanos and darkseid a run for their money 🔥
30:46 b Ellis just contradicted himself in like 3 seconds
Without BJ and his 100% from ft this game would of been different
Nola choked in the clutch
Caleb and BJ on the same team is like when the hero and the villain team up
tnc vs nyc ?????
Great game
Keep doin 2v2 I love em I love seeing teamwork in this environment ✅💪🏿💯
I use to like bj so much but he ain’t been the same frl since around he came in
Great game 👍🏾
Shoutout to the commentators, they dont try to be overly funny, they dont talk too much, and they speak well. All 3 compliment eachother really well and u their love of basketball shows real easily
What a gameeee🔥🔥🔥
Y'all should run these like a ufc fight night style. Start with undercards, some 2v2s, then the main event. This was a main event 2v2 right here!
Moon must've switched sides?
wr, any relaxed any nmw etc
Tae out their tryna coach 😂
BJ the best scorer on TNC even when he bad game and he still led in scoring 😂
HUFF!!!
Aye this was more of a wrestling match than a basketball game 😂
Cel is comedy , 😂 he said are we playing Europe rules right now 😂
Shooting foul at 9:55 where the refs at ? What are they looking at ? What are they doing ?
this 2v2 ain’t no clickbait that’s all imma say
😂 hit the ground running! 🔥🤌🤌
Thank you heavenly Father 🙏🙌
this was a great 2v2 display, both players were equally important to the outcome of the game, them two turnovers scared me a little bit them boys pulled through
7:54 Anthony Edwards
‏‪5:35‬‏ bruhhh shut up let me wath the game
Bj been working on his handles you can tell fs
Nola did not get the same calls at all.
Really good match🔥
Haven’t seen BJ miss a free throw since he’s been on the scene😂
Mannnn Cel on air balls be having me say it when I hoop and shoot an airball.
Bj won that game with his free throw performance, Great game glad to see Caleb finish strong after that little ankle tweak in the beginning. s/o to the other players as well they both played hard and gave a good run for their first times on TNC, i feel like they should be able to come back and show us More
My Mans BJ doesn't get enough air time TNC for as great as he is!!!! I went 300-365 emulating my mans form!!! Give my boy deserved props that he deserves!! This Young Gun is Mega Multi Talented Hooper!!! You know that man so come on!!!!!!
Do yall ever just want to tell the white guy to shut up 😂
Lae and Meech didn't give af about their tiredness lmaoo
Offensively BJ didn’t play well. Took bad shots then missed the easy ones
Man check my dawg Casey out!!
NXT chapter found them two in BJ n Caleb, I like casey game a lot he too tall for the old NXT chapter wave (twins, ai, physco) but he gon do good in the new wave. I’m not sure about the dude in blue, id like to see him versus Rod (dreadhead lefty) to stamp himself. I’m just not sure if bro got a 1s game
I know y'all can play back these clips for the Refs in the Game can each Player get a challenge at 15:07 the ball touched BLUE  SHIRT, it should have been TNC Ball.
Ain't going lie this been some TOP content yall been putting out lately. Yall gotta run TNC New Orleans again
This a great win for TNC not gone cap 🔥🔥
tnc almost at that milllyyyy
Naaaaa this great bump yall boys had a good 1 here 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would like to see BJ vs fomby
BENO VS SLIM🤫😶‍🌫️
BENO VS BJ NEXT‼️🫡
At 5:54 why did the score board go up for Nola when he didn’t make the bucket
3:03 “that was death” 😂😂😂
Used to watch yall on my break at work damn near everyday since y’all was at 100k subs. Always fw the content but charging folks for every good bump now is crazy.
y’all views dropping cuz yall tryna make ppl pay to watch
Very well officiated game
This the best game so far. Gonna be hard to top it!
I think BJ showed he was the best on the court with the timely buckets
They got to come back to play that good against PPV guys Bj and Caleb is TUFF
How tall is Meech?
Casie has way more bag than the other Guy...The guy in the blue has no clutch factor...You have to ridebor die With Casie on that 1
Thank you for coming back Bj
Dillard U's gotta check that foul line spot
terrible refs...
Mfs tryna charge me for a membership to watch basketball 1v1’s and i barely got time to watch these hell tf nah😭
how is every video the greatest game yall ever seen…
No arguing, fighting, complaining just straight hoops🔥🔥🔥bring them back!!! Shoutout to BJ for staying with it through the whole game and shoutout to C4 for taking the scoring load the first half until BJ went on his run.
Both teams played very good
This game definitely a banger !!!
Last layup was disgusting
This was good bump...
Can we be the first platform to not allow Defense to call a Timeout  @Next22Chapter
Bro NO talent has been the BEST TALENT FROM ANY CITY OMGGG 😭😭😭
uh ohhhh he got the red shoessss
on word to santa jose minium invite black tank top back he valid and broski caleb and bj could def be the best duo in the community if they get used to playing together
I'm getting a lil annoyed with Nola always losing close games they should be winning!
C4 is a blessing to watch
Those Nola guys are just too tough...  Caleb & Bj chemistry wasn't as good, but their individual skill set is top tier  Caleb has to be the most polished skilled player on the youtube space
Blue shirt didn’t give his teammate, enough offensively. He was gassed from carrying.
When we start goaltending and let it go 😅
This court slippery my goodness 😂
24:12 Ac 130s everywhere 😅
As many angles as yall have now I would pay a premium price to be able to watch the game and flip through the angle as I want yk
Moon Coaching His City 💯✊
BJ went 50% from the field!!!  Very efficient, games like this they be chucking
Bring them back
Great basketball fr, liked the decision to not call as many fouls both ways towards the end.
Idk black shirt name, but him vs bruce would be good bump
Cel Good To & BJ 💯🔥🏀
Good Two On Two 🔥🔥🔥 BJ My Guy
Caleb got 0 steals huh??
Def one of the best game in awhile, 4 legit pro, no bitching no fighting just hoop professional. Def top dogs deserve to come back asap
C4 had the energy defensively, love it
You can rebound your own airball in every league but NBA. It's a legal shot attempt
Bring them Back !!
Great win foir TNC... definitely a tough battle. Make NOLA the next WARZONE...
Off subject... B. Ellis forhead hella shint lol
So nobody is gonna acknowledge the New Orleans LEGEND Bo McCalebb out there on the floor !?!?  ... I remember watching him throughout his Euroleague career 😤😤😤🪣🪣🪣
Can we get the "ABC's"  crew onna commentary i wanna hear how scotty feel about the games as they go sometimes ‼️
Glad Caleb redeemed himself at the end cuz it looked like he was trying to sell the game 😂😂
them boys wanted that bad.. you could tell in the emotion in the postgame.. love that
FIRST AWF! ADIDA SHORTS AND NIKE SHOES!!! GTFOH
TNC is evolving we only see pro hooper's and they are bringing in the fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.These guys from NOLA did their city proud despite an L they fought like true warriors ,this is the basketball we love to watch
Tae and Rob vs both these 2v2s would be 🔥
Long game but it was intense in the best way
I wanna see the TNC team next year at Quai 54 👀
They don’t hype up Caleb enough 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Caleb a dog
Bruh is Moon TNC or not???? I’m tired of seeing him on the other side damn near every city
another excellent ending to the 2's loving these tnc. what i love so much about TNC is they make it so it's not about TNC winning it's just about good basketball whoever wins I can really just support who i want in each match up etc. I also dig the professionalism none of the ABC crew sat on their phones or anything like that. everyone is locked in.
The wet mop conversation is why I appreciate the ABC crew. Small details but Something only real hoopers know about 😅
For anyone interested in the shoes NOLA:  KC:Kobe 8 protro 'Halo' KB: GT Cut academy 'Grey wolf'  TNC: BJ: KD4 'MVP Season' Caleb: Sabrina 2 Iron Grey
both got double doubles
Watch BIL gon steal your ideas and act stupid like they created it😭
Great game both sides guarded tf out each other bring these dudes back fasho
I thought BJ n Caleb woulda been a match nightmare for anyone, and still are tbh. But these 2 from Nola went toe to toe ‼️ def gotta bring these 2 back & Nola been showing out fs
28:23 travel or and1, just it! Wth 1 free throw 😮 37:28 the same, what’s that 1 free throw 😢
This is legit a top 5 vid TNC has dropped. No shi talk just fatigue and desperation to get the dub. S/ o bj and Caleb who would’ve thought they went up against guys their size or bigger and win.
TNC never misses
C4 and BJ double double
So yall telling me that’s not Bobby Portis?😂
In the nba a player can not rebound their own airball. Thats a travel but this isn’t the nba
BJ and Kaleb being on the same team is wild but also fire 🔥
The GREATEST & Most ELITE clickbait title I've ever seen.
It’s funny how all the entourage telling them how to play yet they not known for playing ball🙄  SIDE NOTE: We need replays!
This is one of the most inconsistently ref’d tnc games I’ve seen in a minute
Great game love to see it even calls on both ends and no crying about calls from either side dam I love to see it this was fire
❤Awesomeness Congratulations Truespeak OneOfOne Unconditionally Unapologetically TNC Style🔥💯🇺🇸🆙
BJ is really like that fr
I could see bj and caleb becoming a 2v2 duo fr if they play more together caleb is a hell of a shot maker and can sit down and we all know what bj brings
That damn sounds so crispy 23:46
Ngl I thought Caleb sold ts great dub tho great bump gotta bring those two back
Yea.. bring em back🔥
We Love You Too Scotty2Hotty. 🙏🏽 🩵 God Bless.
Bro really grabbed the ball off the rim and the refs turned a blind eye lmao
caleb is scary
A real Gladiator Battle⚔️ fasho
BJ and Caleb are the two top dogs The other guys are so good they are better than the other TNC players, they have to stay or I’m gone. Caleb will forever be my best TNC player, I learn from his game.
B Ellis spamming the word “attrition” like the “literally” kid who was getting interviewed 😭😭
Iagl the refs lowkey called some bs too , it was definitely and 1 and he needed to shoot 2 free throws not just 1.
All muscle and can’t back no one down he blowing mine bro .
I will give anyone from TNC BUCKETS I PROMISE 🤣🤣🤣
16:14 you see the jump what cel 🤣🤣
What a game on both ends! Hats off to both teams; they played phenomenal ball! See, this is the type of ball the public needs: no trash talk needed, just letting the game do the talking. Tough buckets on both ends, impeccable defense, albeit a few fouls here and there, but hey, they're playing their hearts out. THIS is a product that will attract the masses because true hoop fans love pure basketball. PLEASE invite these boys back!!!
lol I thought 4 and cel said 4
22:57 yall really goddds have the clinic ! Lmao. Didn’t last time @abccrew
kb bun cheeks
HOLY 45mins?, insta click off🙏😭
Hyper physical matchup. Caleb and BJ chucking bad shots early and got punished for it. Both of them dialed in when it was time tho. Good TNC cashout.
I seeee the red shoeeeeesssss at the end 👀
4:07 look like darvin ham
Classic!
Amazing game
Aye bro this better be a banger more spooky less true crime plz
Bru every game is the greatest game they've ever seen LOL
BJ is nice Bj Scotty C4 and bino king of the court even Lewis maybe for a fifth ooo
I’ll take bj and Caleb over any duo
Ball is life is about to see this concept that yall showed at the end of the video , copy it and say they got it from someone else 😂
Homie in the black sold so bad if ya partner shoots a three chase the rebound
game was too good
We need NOLA warzone asap!!!!
what’s the point of the refs. They just watching.
Yall better SMASH that fuckin LIKE 💯 😤😤
NOLA STAND UP! We might be 0-3 so far, but these have been very intense and highly skilled matchups. TNC is the best platform out there, no competition 😤😤😤
23:43 no chopper gunner above?
BJ and Caleb need to run some more games together.  That duo is a problem!
one of the most skilled 2s i’ve seen fosho
This shit was mid as hell. Ain’t no best 2v2 nothing
Great free throw shooting from bj, that really won them the game.
I would like to see this match-up again.
These 2v2s have been fire
Blue shirt aint used to big game pressure
this was by far, one of the best games on this channel. i always knew caleb was good, but he was really impressive in this game. BJ doing BJ things as always hahaha
So much talent on the court right now!! Image a good center with these 4 guys , It'd be one of the deadliest teams ever formed on YouTube!!
Bj killing but he don’t wanna put the game away he fall a you go for a 3 take that all the way a then keep passing when you got that hot hand right now c4 gas out ain’t making shit an they can’t stop you too the rim
The sewage flap shit is so weird a gross. I hate how B Ellis talks in these. He dresses up every word that comes out of his mouth
Bj might be the best free throw shooter on tnc
I don't see where you can subscribe on the website
Caleb really out here hooping like SpiderMan
Now we see why it was so hard for bj to score on Caleb. That man is lock down defender!!!!! Then with a touch splash of offense! Don’t let Caleb get a deep deep bag. He gone be unbeatable.
Fuck that I know bro want his get back I can tell he ain’t happy fr lol
Is there some sort of agreement to not utilize pick and rolls in order to more sensationalize the game?
My dude in the black beater look like that BB hell dude 😂😂😂
BJ and Caleb on the same team is a defensive nightmare
need casey vs bruce lowkey
It be crazy when people tell you what to do in the huddle. And some be speaking facts but they just don’t understand even if you are in ok shape the shit ain’t as easy as they speak it fighting through fatigue and some.
Lei and bra ass bias ash wit the call
aye c4 almost blew me when he threw it away😂😂
The nba you can’t rebound your own airball. Everywhere else in the states it’s legal.
A and B yall really sat there with straight faces when he said this foolery 16:08 not once but TWICE 😭
That was pay per view worthy. Respect 🫡 all around gents. How many free throws did BJ hit? Sheesh great game!
C4 CANNNN SITTTTTT DOWNNN IDCWNS
“2nd down”😂😂😂
The most skilled 2v2 in the space I've seen this was quality bump and effort !
I like these 2 together I need see more 2v2s wit bj n Caleb ngl they wiping half
Ok the ppv stuff I’ll pay for, but why the stuff in the city  events we gotta start paying for now🥀💔
This mf bj got catch and shoot on HOF ain’t no way that’s the first shot we taking 🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂😂
This could’ve been ppv easily
As a member of the accountability department 2025, I have to say as a pro hooper Caleb’s overall shot selection & decision making in this run was very questionable, hats off to bj for maintaining his composure as a teammate and keeping a ‘next play’ mentality
This tournament is GODLY!!!!! AHHHHHHHH
Idk why nola tried ending it with a 3 instead of trying to go for lays
FIREEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! WE WANT THEM BOTH BACK!!!
This is what they’re talking about when they the space is evolving. I love the twins but imagine them playing either of these teams 💀
NXT CHAP💪
What a grind, congrats BJ and Caleb 🔥
How slippy are these courts bro wtf
Black was shooting that thang
That boy Caleb a problem
16:15 “you see the jump Jurassicly” 😂😂😂😂
I guess every game is the most elite they’ve ever seen
Bj and Caleb over any 2 in the yt scene
Run that shit back ASAP!!!!!!!!
Predator missiles on free throw is crazy
GREAT 2v2
B Ellis called it correctly. Timely 3. Caleb pulled the chair out and sat down!!!
Great Bump ‼️‼️🔥🔥
That dude kb only got that half spin 🤣🤣 niggag counter please
Half time at 9 minutes for a 40 something minute video 😅
The court good mud?
Meech be standing like his sciatica hurt
Bj giving Durant vibes 💯just the movement
What a game. Almost everyone from Nola needs to come back or war zone time
BJ I wish you would of put that Nola boy on a postaaa after that Hezi🥲
Bring both fellas back imo
“Are you excited to play with each other?” ayooo???
I want to see ABC crew disagree more, every time I see a guy have a thought I see them backtrack a little if another member disagrees.
Crazy half time that early on a long ass video 😂😂😂
Tough ass game
Gotta be the stiffest net i ever seen
Watching this made me remember BJ be guarding fr
Great game but I don’t really want to see these guys back unless they are playing together. Great players but I wouldn’t say they are 1v1 guys on the space. I see a Mad dawg type player in bro in the black though
Best 2v2 of the year
Bring the twins back
8:12 no smoking in the gym sir
Caleb locked the fuck up
What a game wow real basketball
they all almost got a double double
I didnt like this at all
16:15 Jurassic-Ly 🦖😂
Great win for these 2 def a hard fought battle
19:20 yeah but it still has to hit the rim smh
Best 2v2 I’ve seen in a while good game fr 🔥💯
Y'all gotta change that clear rule. It's dumb. Reward players for playing passing lanes & steals
A 2v2 duo series gotta be put together
Why all the 3ps?
Off the top BJ says this is gonna be fun?  He was not wrong 🔥🔥
Great game 😖👏🏽😮‍💨
Let's effing go !!  GG,'s
It’s like they playing in an ice rank. It looks slippery af.
20:00 that is not a travel lmaooo
Besides games played there is no reason Caleb can't be considered the best player on the scene!
Aye When the TWINS COMING BACK? 💯🔥🔥🔥
I was waiting 4 this match up for a while
them right here i want to see them do a 4v4 verses ballislife beno, deebones, tyglover, and fomby or scar
26:58 wouldve been a crazy thumbnail
5:10 bj🤣🤣
I enjoyed this game tbh bj had me stressing cause ik he can make all those 3’s he was shooting but great effort from both teams
You gotta bring them to back
I like Meech and Lay and they deserve a spot somewhere in this league, but they aren’t experienced enough. The games are too high level for them. They need a few more years. My opinion of course
absolute dog fight
BJ and Caleb Vs Lance and Beas, it’ll be an intense game.
Blue shirt and black Tank deserve to come back
GOD BLESSED EVERYBODY'S FAMILY'S BLESSINGS 🙌 🙏 ✨ ❤
I had to pause mid video to press the like button. It’s some sewage flap action going on in this game 😖
Why are they "BLEU" Devils LMAO
C4 started selling at the end pmo
S/O B Ellis barber my goodness
Why did they keep attacking Caleb in the post when it wasn’t working AT ALL?
13:22 is a crazy travel 😂
Halftime at the 8:34 mark on a 45 min video. Mfs either locking up or can’t purchase a bucket
No interference at 31:50 is crazy😭
Thats manifesting b Ellis not a pull or predicting the future lol
Y’all let Caleb foul the whole entire game
Caleb showing off the handle and finally started driving the basketball. He keep showing these skills he may be top 10 in the space.
18:50 The only league where you can’t get your own air ball is the NBA. For high school, college and FIBA it’s perfectly legal to rebound your own air ball so long as the ref (subjectively) deems it as a shot attempt. A self pass is what’s not allowed at all levels in all leagues.
0:29 wow
is this the first time with 3 players dropping 20 and 10/double doubles in a 2v2?
This vid feels like a PPV 🔥🔥🔥
no ft clinic for bj 😂🥳
This was a great game 🫡‼️
The refs had to be hi this game
Casey look like Sheck Wes
Ay lat finna put belt to ah yassir aha ya digg!!
Blue shirt kinda lost them that off all the turnovers. They tough tho. You can tell dude in the black probably the best 5v5 player there.
BJ is like KD from the free throw line automatic 🔥🔥
That foul at 28:28 should've been an and 1. The whistle was literally blown way after he had already started going up.
shout out to lat my favourite ref hope they start calling carry’s soon much less with these 6 than the usual
Bro grabbed it straight off the rim 😂
Omggg one of the best vids on the channel fasho dawg fight!!
Every game is the same click bait ahh title smh 🤡
Can I pay for this video? Take my money!!!
Your content is always engaging, real, and inspiring.
a milly is right you have to shoot 3s it’s basketball.  it wasn’t until steph. but he’s shown why 3>2
Great game! N.O. just ran outta gas fr. They had it! Louisiana stand up baby we outchea!
35:24 bro airballed and got the ball back ain't that a travel or something?
Excited to play wit each other Ayooo Scotty 😂😂😂😂
Excellent Game!
Man I hate them nets on that rim. That mf so ass 😂😂
you cant catch your own airball in the nba
This vid is fire 🔥🔥 but when are we getting that women’s 1v1 drop?? Been waiting on that!
They all the "greatest" you seen bruh lol click bait titles go wild
KB gotta take more shots that first half. He really good
17k+ views but 2k+ likes is a crazy ratio 😂 cmon yall like the vid smh that 💩 FREE !!!
Yeah TNC players getting money now😭😭 sitting down energy all low come on man NOLA side everybody standing up lit! Bring me along I bet I turn that mf up. TNC hype man ya diiigg! Hmu Scotty I gotchu Johnny Bravo💪😂😂😂
This best 2v2 I seen on this channel no bap
Idk who he asked but you CANNOT touch your own airball. Thats considered a travel. They call it all the time in the league
8:43 So did the slick floor have some to do with what's goin on with Burke?
Yes Caleb is back !
Caleb play any games before this one? Looked like he was fighting for his life the whole time lol
Scotty be so anxious 😂
Gotta set up a over the rim camera put it at the top of the backboard
You guys should seriously look at a 2v2 league. Let the players pick the teams. Even just a tournament.
It would be good if you start with some background of these players so we know who these players are, where they played, and why you've chosen them.
That game was a straight dog fight.
Wish bj would challenge himself a little more on defense in the beginning he was doing too much late contesting way to show up in the clutch tho 💯💯
This what I'm talking about these guys balled
QUALITY BUMP!!!
These two guys HAVE to come back. They stayed toe to toe with Caleb and BJ... ppv guys and def top tier youtube hoopers.... these two randoms from Nola.... gotta bring them back asap, they are way above most of the hoopers in these style of events.
I just think tbh the games have been good just carried out bc of the court, the rims and how maybe humid it was in the gym so guys can’t play as hard bc of all the slipping and tripping, would’ve been 10x better on just a better court and rims
Dude look like play boy carti slick
Wassup with that spot on the court? atleast one slip there every game, needs to be checked out
That boy bj got them big steppas on😭😭
Jesus Christ loves you
Why scotty always gotta say some horny stuff and then sit there with a sh*t eatin' grin all the time LOL
Bj got lazy asf
It’s Jurassicaly jumping 🦖
How much is subscription?
This court gonna end someone
C4 and bj had a double double 😂
@Next22Chapter Did I win the $1000 y'all promised in the chat.
Wow what a game
This game was soooo 🔥 🔥
We got nino paid vs Jordan Crawford
why was he sweating bullets before even playing 😭
My boy Rob Kazi was going sick
This the second time i've seen KB on YT would like to see him back he got game fr
this game was griddy asf. if this free, i know tnc league got some heat coming 😂
These 2 together? 😮 oh yeah game is over dont even need to watch it
That tournament to 30 sounds lit
My favorite players on the same team this fye 🔥
This matchup was the true meaning of talent beats hard work. NOLA boys got grit but you can tell Caleb and BJ are individually more talented.
Great game bring them boys back
Casey sold not going after that last rebound
Dear Cel: JURASSIC and DRASTIC are two separate, didtinct words and NOT dubiously interchangeable ... "Jurasically" is craaaazy lolol but it almost still fit within the context  sooo... 😂😅😂😅😂 🦖 🐲 🦕 🦖 🏀 🏀 🏆
That was a foul bro did not go out of bounds
C4 HAD ME STRESSING AT THE ENDDDD😂😂😂😂
Damn
This game showed me bj might be top ten and even tho caleb looked nervous offensively all game his defense is top tier
needa see bj n caleb as a duo again
What a game
I liked cause brown shirt commentating is A1
Lowkey boring game but players were fighting for sure
How can I watch LP man?
Did my boy Cel just say Jurassicly instead of drastically lol
BJ AND C4 DAMN 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is it late on my end
That b ellis "out the gate" sounded like Yunus, IYKYK!!
Catch it live two time in a row 😊😊 5:27
😮😮😮
bj and caleb on the same team seems heinously unfair
