Everyone knows Mctominay is crap. But people thinking Bruno is not crap is bizarre! I mean look who is defending Bruno, sorry Beth.
How does gold bridge not choke out the old geezer… lol
Yeah they do mate, not sure where your from but in australia they do. You may refer to them as crisps..
Ricky’s opinion is as useless as a comb for a bald person
Ricky talking about Bruno not keeping the ball but who can he pass it too?
I love Ricky he is a great  man who knows football the lot
I think we are letting Bruno down he would be far better in a better team players around who can score
Ricky is worse than McTominay..
Garnacho over elanga all day long. Much more potential.
Beth bigging up Bruno. The human waffle machine 😂😂😂
Scott McTalentless and Fred cost Ole his job, McTalentless is still getting game time and is going to cost Ten Hag his job.
What does Bruno do best, Beth?
Ricky’s players that he said should start:   Mata  Matic  Dan James   Non have done anything since leaving us
Anthony unfortunately is crap! He cuts in every single time.  I could go down the park and buy a player for £100 who would be just as good!
Bruno is a player for a mid table team to be honest
Brexit-Ricky
Completely agree Beth, Bruno is class, watch him properly he is different class, and with all the other dross in the side, Anthony, Scott, Rashford when hes CF its unreal that we are even talking about Bruno
Love Ricky class guy and talks since
I’d sell Rashford in a hurry. It’d be best for his career and the club. Sometimes you need a fresh project.   Sir Alex did it with Van Nistelrooy and Beckham
When Casemiro plays we still don’t pick up the midfield runners. Look at goals Brighton scores against us. It’s tactical
Fulham beat arsenal continued to Rob the all stars of arsenal while they were asleep, no different here mctominay hopeless, where was pur defense and tracking back
The fact that Beth says it’s the players but then defends the captain who’s factually been one of our worst performers is hilarious. Bruno gives away possession countless times. He puts us on the back foot at least 4 times a games
Selling Elanga for 15 million and buying Antony for 85 million is a sackable offense
Rickys obsession with McTominay is just weird
She's bare annoying dunno why
Ricky knows ball 😌👈
Lol it’s on the manager to teach how to break a low block. Mate 3 1/2 managers later and the team still can’t break a low block might just be the players
All the the best guys great content as always 👍
I’m sorry, but Ricky is just anti ETH. He can’t talk about how good McTominay is (when he’s horrible), he blames ETH for selling a player. My goodness attacking Garnacho and saying Elanga is better than our entire attacking lineup is just whining. Grow up .
Beth is a great example of only being on the channel because she ticks boxes FUCKING CLUELESS MAN
Ricky 😂😂😂😂❤❤
Ricky speaking facts once again. A lot of fans live in a fantasy of how good the players are. The players fans love aren’t that good and they’ll continue to inconsistent. It’s 5 years now of the same thing.
I think the Glazers brothers would make a better back 4 than our lot
Seriously would any of Utd players get near the man city squad. Waste of time arguing about tactics when the players are below standard
Elanga better than Rashford and Garnacho? This guy doesnt have a clue. No doubt Rashford has been absolute trash this season but really ... Elanga had more than enough opportunities at United and was not convincing at all.
Ricky does your channel no favours, had to switch off.
Jordan needs to be on the show more often. Speaks a lot of sense.
It is not about players not trying, it is rather about the tactics, game plan and poor selection and that is on the manager
Shall we get these two a room so they can be with Bruno and McSauce
Nobody is telling Bruno that he needs to calm it down because these managers are bums
Bruno better than Odegaard? Seriously😮
Just take off Bruno!
Only players I would keep for a complete rebuild. Mainoo, Hojlund, Bruno, Garnacho, Martinez. The rest are all expendable. I don't count the younger players breaking through as we don't have enough evidence on them to judge.
United looked very shaky. They looked nervous on the pitch. They had no energy, as it they were still tired from the intensity of the Villa game. Even though they had a week off. Also, these players can't consistently perform on a weekly basis and they have no back up players to switch with. Garnacho is still learning, so I understand he will be inconsistent right now until he develops. Erikson looked terrible, Rashford was poor, Antony just isn't good enough. Varane looked shaky and error prone, AWB was a disgrace to the shirt today. Nothing back when his wing was being attacked. Had no urgency of intensity.He has a McTominay performance. AWB the ghost! Dalot sloppy in possession. Where they all on the beer the night before?
17.40
Ricky OUT.....??
Ricky making up facts to prove his point. Mctominay started and played the full match against west ham🤦🏻
Love Jordan, he speaks so much sence.  But has he got a permanent cold 🥶
Beth - "He's (Fernandes) better than Odergard." 🤣🤣🤣 Deluded!
the problems in our club are clear to see , the players apart from a couple are not good enough,  the manager & the coaching staff are not good enough,  we need a mass clearout and a new manager
eric said quote " we over achieved last season end quote . What winning the carabao cup and getting champions league football ? Some one should explain to him that this is MANCHESTER UNITED not ajax
Every player needs to go it’s all rotten to the absolute idiots who think sacking the manger will do anything and that we won’t be back in the same spot in a year is just crazy
Did Beth just say Bruno is better than Odegaard?! 😂😂😂😂😂
“Bruno is better than Odegaard”🤦🏾‍♂️
We got rid of Ronaldo to be the worst attacking team in the league
Jordan is great . Love his analysis
I agree with Ricky that Van Der Beek is a good player. Why he doesn't play more often is astounding ?!?
Ricky should get called out more. His Bruno point was brainless and they all just say there
Ricky the only one who talks sense 😢
Rickys so irratating.. the shite he talks about  elanga being the best forward at united 😂
Get the hag out. Get in beth
Your club after decades of success is now rotten.  Was left in a bad state by Fergie.  Will take you another 15 years to win the PL.  will be a slow process.  You can’t sack entire squad will be 1/2 players a year.
Amad should be brought in for a run in the side, finally give him a chance...
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watching this lot is like having a fever dream from the 90's!!!😂😂😂😂.
Bruno just presses the ref at the moment
Van de geek is a good player.  Sancho is a good player   Amad is a good player.   All of these good players haven’t had a good run of games
Ricky is right Bruno should have come off for MCTominay.
Houland is a BUM
Garnacho is not good
Should have played vdb and subbed sancho.
Rashford has never been the player some people think he is. Last year was a spike in his career, this year is business as usual.
Bruno wouldn't get into any top team in prem
what Ricky says about  Bruno and his chance creation at 20m 40s is so right ive been saying it for years for every chance he creates he looses the ball 5 or 6 times that's not chance creation is possession loss that puts us under pressure in transition
Mark, let's not make Mctominay the scapegoat for the goals. UTD were useless in the 1st half & no better in the second. There is a rot going through the club. Off the pitch & on it, it's obvious there are a few bad apples on the pitch, who are supposed to be influential. They need moving on, fernandez is not a captain & his histrionics are not inspiring!
Elanga is better than our whole front line, beside garnacho
Beth is deluded about Bruno.
I’m sorry.. I am portuguese, I actually watch our games, he is not our best player most of the times, that’s just a lie. headless chicken all the time..
TEN HAG ….. ITS TIME TO GO!!!
Exactly… The players are not Very good. This ISManchester United's level.what makes the fans think this is Unacceptable when It's the same thing now for 12 years. You are a Slightly above MidTable club,
Elanga 💯💥🔥
United was not this bad under Ole, im sorry
The protecting of players like Mctominay is why this club is where it is.
Bruno over Odegaard is an outrageous statement!
This is the best Utd stand panel. Great work
Fun fact: Bruno done more defensive work than mcsause in that match
Mc T  is a shite player Ricky. Mind you they all are.
Ricky's right in saying that Elanga is miles better than Rashford but he is one of many that has flourished after leaving Utd, when he was playing for us was a pacy winger but with no end result and that's why he was sold and same with Dan James and Andreas Pereira they weren't worth keeping but once they got with other teams-they improved greatly!.
Beth and Bruno is Ricky and Mctominay. Neither would get into top 6 side
Have you ever seen Ten Hag admit he got it wrong and hold is hand up its his fault? if you have post it because I don't think he ha it him do so - his ego is too big never at fault.
Sick of Ricky just another example of player fc. Scott isn’t good enough the same way rashford, Antony, Bruno isn’t good enough
Beth rates all the bang average players. She got no bad thing to say about them. Bizarre. Is it some kind of new weird kink I’m not aware of?
Rashford couldn't be bothered as per usual wan bissaka just wonders around like he's playing with his mates down the local field all round awful
Starting to think ricky on mc tommny pay role
Selling Elanga was a mistake!
I love Ricky, legend. But he must let Mctominey go, worst player on the pitch.
1st commenter nailed it in pointing out the difference between rhis ManU team facing a low block team vs a team that pamys football.  HAG's got players who can only create on the counter attack when they have space to run into.
Fat Rick has got dementia
Danny wellbeck is a better team player than Bruno
Sorry Beth, Bruno is good but overrated. He is not in the same level at bernado
It's always the midfielders went to sleep.
Behave Beth , Bruno wouldn’t even start for Leicester nvm any top six prem side
Mactominay should be sold first before any other player on the PITCH
To be fair ive never seen united players dribble past players, non of them.
Carnt keep putting it down to Scott Mck, its not on one player. Hes not a holding defensive player, he should have come on for Eriksen. TENs in game tactics are questionable. Weve got an average squad, hence were inconsistent and average. Mid table United.
For a long time united has been playing and getting goals through wing counter attack play hence Bruno most of his good chances he creates are mainly for wingers
Amad needs to start games now.. man has proven himself in the championship.. he needs his opportunity going forward..
Revisionist Ricky has a very deluded memory of Elanga.
Ten h out now 😂😂
We’re in Nottingham aren’t we!
I hate how slow our game is and how our build up play ends at the 18box
McTominay average rating this season is around 2/10
I love how Utd fans keep saying......We are Man Utd.............yes but you are sh1te.....hahaha
Remember when people said Fernandes was better than De Bruyne. 😂
What part of manchester is Jordan from? He sounds like worzel gummidge.
Why dont you lot go and learn and watch united forevertv because u lot are done am shocked you have a following. Beth is useless and the rest of you well am lost for what to say !!!!@@@@
I miss Berbatov
Beth saying Bruno can play a patient game. No evidence that he has ever done that in his career. Do your research!
Building from back is useless when our midfielders and attackers can't pass the ball around in opposition half without losing it
Eric Ten Aaaaaaarrrrrrggggghhhh!!
Nothing will change in that team until they move on Scott McTominay, he seems to always work his way in to the managers good books even though he's clearly not good enough in the positions they're playing him.
I can't believe  what happen to manunited team right now, the team is getting worst  and worst, manunited glory  is over,
Reminder that ten hag wanted gakpo, not Antony
Next year will be better 🤥
Before we get rid all the players, we need to get rid Ricky first. Utterly rubbish
Garnacho is the next rashford.. absolutely useless overrated player
Bruno is one of the worst players to ever play for this club..what does this idiot beth sees in him
Bruno will not get in top team. Not a chance he is part of the problem and he is NO CAPTAIN
Get back to reality Beth . Stop defending Bruno .
He thought bringing In Mctominay, he would have a chance to score with 2nd balls....... that was his tactic.  This manager is  as fraud.
How much did Ten Hag from Antony’s trade? Lol
Why beth is sucking bruno off like that?
Ten-Hag cost us the game again!! - take out holder and you play nobody 😮‍💨   This manager is clueless if not useless 🙄
It's sweeper keeper girl
What is this revisionism with elanga lmao he was terrible at United 😂
wow BETH TUCKER 🤩😋💦
Cmon ricky...you go all the way to count what bruno's creativity is at...pls do some math on your prodigal son Mactominay....
EtH lies at every presser or he is lunatic. And admiting yesterday tactical masterpiece he asks for booting.
I want to see Bayindir, Dalot, Varane, Martinez, Shaw, Casemiro, Maino, Mount, Garnacho, Amad, Hojlund play at some point this season. I’m desperate for Amad to take Antony’s place in the first XI
Ten Hag has to take the blame. He should never ever disturb the deep midfield especially Mainoo. Time and again McT has been terrible at the back. Ten Hag should use some brain. The best defense is the great offense. Any other manager could have easily gotten more out of this team, even with injuries. Terrible decisions throughout the season.
MACTOMINAY is crap
Mark cant help his agendas.
You people are not funny. Stop making lame attempts at bald jokes
I was never Fergie out. Because I was only 19 when United were sh*t under Sir Alex Ferguson in 1989, and I was kinda used to United being sh*t anyway.
This team is a bunch of toxic players that don’t have the football IQ or the ability to perform at the levels a lot of people think they are capable of
Its not ten hags fault utd midfield still dependant on mctominay. For godsake he has been shite since oles wheel.
Mcsnowflake is the biggest coward of a midfielder I have ever seen play at Old Trafford.
It is just a history for rashford, regarded as a most dangerous player in England. Now he became a "toothless dog". Bruno rashfor and mctominay cannot play alongside each other. The result will be a disaster. Put up jan 24 "sales" for rashford bruno mctominay casemiro martial and antony. These players have no more playing value.
Beth and Mark are just but Bruno apologists
This whole squad is a joke. It’s not just Ten Hag, though his tactics are rubbish, it’s everyone and everything.
How is someone like Beth who has no clue about football the host lol
29 years ETH breaking more records
Antony worst sighning ever for manutd
This says it all. ETH on subbing in McTominay:  Ten Hag was pleased with the vitality Scott McTominay was able to add to the team after his introduction, at the end of a busy week, even if the half did not pan out as intended following our no.39’s introduction.  “I don’t regret [the substitution]. I thought Scott, he brought energy, I think second half was much better [from] our side," the boss added.
The players know they can’t win anything, and also, they have too fat contracts and this causes no motivation in the short term for them. Just twinkle a bit now and then is plenty
Ten Hag's failure is in not raising about the quagmire. He did last year. So he's proven he can be successful at this Club. He's also shown how he has made mistakes. The players aren't good enough but then one should understand what good enough is. They were good enough for 3rd place and I'm not buying that they over achieved or it was a new Manager bounce. After a 38 game league season and deep runs in multiple tournaments, you are what your record says you are. And last year, Manchester United were the third best team in the league and a Domestic Cup winner. That's who they were last year. This year, they are 7th or 8th.   The question is how did they go from 3rd to 8th. The majority of the squad that finished 3rd and won a trophy are still there. What changed. What happened. The obvious answer is the personnel changes that were made during the summer were wrong. And that's on Ten Hag and the front office.
Get lost,you bloody wanted onana.
They took control when Mainoo went off and Mctominay came on
Bruno as Captain is everything wrong with United.
Van de Beek is a good player and better than Bruno. He never got his chances. We ruined 2-3 years of his career!
Ffs - Ricky is so deluded. McShite is absolutely crap - end of!
Beth would have brought in McTominay for eriksen! The problem with man United’s coaches and this channel is same , bigging up Bruno and Trashford lol 😂
Sell all the crapy players with gorgeous salaries that play when they want to and who think themselves irreplaceable! The majority of United players should be in the Champions league(second division) and Onana should be exported back to Italy!
ETH has no clue, time to go
ETH OUT
WE WILL SURVIVE RELEGATION
We have high quality young players rotting on the bench in Hannibal, Pellistri and Dan Gore. Only thing Bruno does well is play the forward pass quickly against a high line. There were moments yesterday when Bruno can cross with right foot or play to Antony's feet inside the box. But Bruno doesn't cross and instead puts a pathetic cross with his left foot on another occassion. Instead of playing to Antony's feet, Bruno plays a pass inside the defender and ball goes out of play. Hannibal is a much better alround player than Bruno who knows when to take time on the ball and can bring others into play. Ten Hag is not the right man to take us forward.
YO JIM  SACK ETH NOW FOR GOD'S SAKE
Omg don’t sack him . Put the joint down .
Can we all just agree that it's both the personnel and the manager. Why does it have to be one or the other. Both sides of the dynamic are not working. But the main, salient point is The manager can't motivate this team correctly
Baldy   Has to go
For gods sake  Ricky  call it a day  . Scotty is shite stop it
Wan bissaka was closest coming back jogging to get on Gibbs white. But he just let him run.
Mct off the bench to lose a match has happened more than he came off and won a match, absolutely abysmal player along with the rest
Amad is so cool and brilliant. Looks like a different class. And, I always like the way Ricky gives out his opinions but defending McTominay is yesterday’s newspaper. He is only good enough to see out game at final 5-10 minutes if we are leading. He and Rashford must go if we need to be the old glorious Man United
Antony is a new Martial … MU can’t afford to have two Martials
Usually when you miss watching a united match you feel sad and annoyed. Nowadays it is the opposite. You feel happy and elevated not to watch this ‘BUNCH OF LOOSER’S’.
Should be using mctominay as CAM but not CDM, rashford left, garnacho n amad right, Antony with Sancho out of squad, the bald man with ETH out of stadium for giving wrong advice on substitution
Sell the core of senior players. None of them will get into a West Ham. Bruno/Rashford/Antony/Macsauce all must go
And beth get of your knees bruno is not that good he cant even turn
This old man imitating to be maternal uncle of Mctominay
Ricky’s blood thinners are going to wear out & he’s going to have a heart problem. Take a breath pal.
Onana Varane Martinez shaw Dalot Mainoo casemiro Bruno garnacho amad Rasmus.
Ricky saying Elanga is better than a 19 year old who played well against one of the best inform team on the right side he never played before. Then go ahead and defended Mctominay hide and seek cameo. Its sickening to listen to him these days
Ricky lol. Mctominay was playing against west ham. Problem with that game tho is Bruno and mctominay were playing. Both can’t play
Jordan looks 16 years older every game. Stop drinking bro.
Ricky is our version of TY
I’m all for difference of opinion etc but come on Ricky, you defend McTominay better than he can defend on the pitch! If we played a team full of Ricky’s favourites we’d be in a relegation scrap.  Constantly ignores criticism of the problem players but jumps on the bandwagon with Bruno, Antony etc boring boring boring
We watch Anthony week in week out every match, but yet still have fans trashing why Sancho called out the manager for his favouritism.
Im done 😢
An Ajax manager comes with and from a culture that was never going to work at Man U - yes, some very skilful players are underperforming and tactics and tactical subs aren’t working. It all points to manager/coach inadequacies and therefore sooner or later a change is imperative as any hope of Man U making top 4 is highly unlikely.
Ten Hag.  That is the main problem bad management bad coaching bad signings and mc kenna leaving  since then united have got worse
Rick you cant keep piling blame on players you don’t like and protecting players you do like Mctominey is not good enough. Simple as that my friend.
Change the wage structure to 75k a week max and rest as bonus if they win EPL or qualify for CL.
Cant believe how bad bruno and rashford are there dragging us down not to mind anthony hes woeful
One bright spark is that Amad looks like a little tank, he is strong, quick, great feet and touch, looks dangerous. He’s got the strength that Pellistri needs to get. I think RW should be Amad and Pellistri.
Sorry but Ricky is high as a kite if he doesnt see his contradiction in the way he criticises others compared to Mctominay.  Im not specifically ETH in but i dont see any alternatives and id like to see whether we can improve our club structure before appointing a new manager
Ricky needs to take a breath instead of finishing the sentence in one breath.i know he talks alot of scutter but he needs to talk less or take a breath before finishing your sentence.
I cant watch that absolute idiot Ricky anymore, Stretford end for me
They can't win nor draw a game
I recall a game where Pogba, Mata and Bruno were in the same team. The passing and ball retention was slick. Put better players alongside Bruno and you'll see the difference.
Good chat lads sensible discussion ...Beth is better with these guys.....
Man u got no big players they All are no good
Antony £90Million in , Elanga £15Million out   What does Eric Ten Hag see......  Perhaps he needs some glasses 😂
On track for 59 pts. Back to the Rangnick season. We clearly haven't progressed. Our form has been abysmal since the League Cup win in February. The players cannot develop a ruthless winning menality and this is what you get. 14 defeats and counting 👎
ETH said it was mainoos 3rd game in a row they're gonna get a 8 day rest anyway
Haven't seen the game yet but it's no surprise I'm hearing "Elanga" outclassed our forwards another blunder from ETH......MG can keep resisting the inevitable but he's doing it  to himself (ETH) by his choices on who he's cut and who he's kept and his in match management it's all highly questionable....are the players all rubbish as MG suggests , NO they are not it's down to ETH as manager  how the team performs a draw against Liverpool at Anfield win at home against Villa both good results then lose to NF.with a poor performance  ...... 🤔 Manager unable to get the best from the team with his pre game instructions 🤔
Ive no doubt the goalie last season covered a lot of cracks with the saves and thats why united finished where they did. This season onanna is dirt and conceding soft goals
Ricky is spot on the attacking bests of the united! They are simply not that good together.
Pay them what they deserve minimum wage there shite
What is the point of this forum😂😂😂😂. Blaming all to players. Nuno even playing the same players as Copper did
They squared the ball in the box a fair few times.. and nothing came of it.
Bruno cannot dribble
Bruno isn’t good enough to play for any top team, only Shaw is.
ten hag really loves attacking football, he subed mainoo for mctominay.
There wasn't an overload, Mctominay didn't need to help Dalot. Ricky is deluded.
In first half, it was mainoo who was defending the danger areas infront of our box. Both their goals in second half came from such positions. Ten Hag doesnt read the game one bit. If Ten Hag was good at reading the game, Pellistri and Hannibal would be playing more and Bruno, Mctominay and Rashford will be on the bench more
Bruno is limited can’t carry the ball he cannot dribble because of that it’s hard to impact the game
Consistently inconsistent.   This team waited to concede.
Get this girl Beth off air
Stop defending Mcshite Ricky so biased towards the players he likes and dislikes, absolutely embarrassing
Thanks for this years entertainment, guys. Oh, and if you read this, Mark, you need to look after Beth, because at this rate she will get a job offer she can't refuse.  Compared to some of the so-called pundits on TV, 'our' Beth is ace, and knocks spots off of them.
I have never rated ricky from the day he said dan james brings structure to the team😂😂joker.
Ricky spot on about Bruno - he is the tirnover king and a huge problem with his impatience
Mctominy is fucking crap sorry worse midfielder in the team
Love you Ricky but Mctominay is shite mate - he has to go
ETH wants out. What other possible reason could he have for hooking Mainoo and destroying the midfield with MCTOMICUNT? 🙈🙄🤷
It’s like having a girlfriend that cheats on you all the time 😂
Ahemnm....simply put....Ten Haq ouuutttt!!!!
Not wasting my time watching these players ever again.. mctominay will sack yet another manager
Serious question Beth do you really think Bellingham would be the same player is he came here did you see what we did to sancho?
U lot have all this horrible stats and still Tenhag in.... brilliant 😂
"What a Load of Rubbish!!!!!"
Like a chimps tea party this , clueless 😂
One subs killed us
These players with few exceptions like Onana have proved at some point that they have the quality. The inconsistency and lack of motivation is a lot down to the manager. That's why he has to go.
Antony is so bad. It is scary. EtH and everyone else should be saked based on that alone.
Mctominay is Ricky's boy lol
But but but ten hag is brilliant,he drew with Liverpool and beat villa,but but but
Fernandes, Rashford, McTominay, wan Bissaka, Dalot and others simply aren’t good enough. They’re tactically naive and simply not talented enough to dominate possession and make incisive passes. Multiple managers can’t all be wrong. They try and can run a bit but they’re simply not capable of beating top teams.
Best chance no europe next season and start fresh. If we get europe these deadwood stay
Guys, Bruno Fernandes is not the world class player that many fans seem to be determined to believe he is. He does not deseeve the status that he has.
Beth is clueless about contracts stipulations, e.g. players starting a certain number of games etc. ETH out. Blew £400M on crap. Got rid of club legends. Enough is enough.
Some good catharsis in the chat after a really miserable team performance and yet another terrible result. Evans, Varane and Mainoo excepted, players should be donating their wages to charity after that.
Happy New Year Beth my wife ❤
Ricky defending McTominay and shitting on Garnacho is the perfect example of why he should not be on camera talking about football, other than for the laughs/memes.
Let INEOS analyse United staff/players then make ruthless decisions to go about addressing our chronic problems.
The same old story the same problems the same excuses the same results and worst of all the same old crap ownership,   A team that isn't good enough and a manager who's out of his depth,   I'm not shocked anymore I'm not even angry  just sad,
we need a new  full time
Why do we get so many injuries
Beth’s takes (backing bruno while scapegoating the whole game on mctom as if the team was playing well before he came on anyway, blaming players when TEN HAG HAS NO SYSTEM, with most of the squad being HIS SIGNINGS) are just sad to see
I think we get lost in the elanga Antony thing, he wasn’t a direct replacement tho Elanga was still at the club last season when Antony was signed
That old fart ain’t got a clue
Mctominay started against west ham! can someone please stop ricky from manipulating and getting facts wrong to support his bias - it makes this channel less credible
The best United stand line up. Beth, Jordan, Kev, and Ricky, thoroughly enjoyed the show, but I can’t stand these players 😡
im sorry but your assessment on ETH spend is ridicolous... ETH wanted antony and Martinez before the window opened and reported amount was 40 mil for each, then Glazers/Murtough delayed and delayed so Ajax put the price up....  ETH was given Weghorst, Evans,  - ETH wanted Kim Min Jae and got Evans.... Mount i dont Believe is a ETH signing....
Jesus I have never listened to such piss 😊
Beth you are clueless
Beth fronting this diabolical channel is a joke .
Ten Hag has confirmed that the McTominey substitution was tactical and apparently he brought great energy. 😳😳😳
We dont have any world class players and not even one top class player in our squad...Bruno was world class, hes useless atm.... bunch of mediocre overpaid primadonnas
“We apologize for last week’s interruption; normal service has now once again resumed and we don’t foresee any further interruptions going forward.”  - Man United
Liverpool were absolutely abysmal last season. Pathetic.   They lost 14 games in all competitions.   United have already lost 14 this season. It's still December.
People celebrate Garnacho which is absolutely garbage.....lets fire another manager and continue with the same useless players
Ricky u 🤡 take your jock mc💩 goggles of he is not good enough for this club get rid now 🤬😡
Bruno always starts. Hes missed like 4% of 212 games.  When he plays they win 55% of the time.  When he does not play they win 75% of the time.  The last game he didnt play they won.  Why tf is this guy on the pitch?
We over played Elanga even when he was poor that’s United’s problem squad depth rotation
I would love to know at what point Jordan would consider sacking thr manager? What if he loses another 8-9 games which seems very realistic based on the number of games left
I have to watch this for pure comedy value. Beth things Bruno would get in top teams and is better than Odegaard 😂.....Oscar Bobb at City is better 🤦‍♂️
BRUNO IS OVERRATED
Fire him. He's out of his depths.
TH must know now that Mctominay has cost him the game . Without energy t defend the midfield we can’t attack
Cant believe there are people in this world who wouldn't sell rashford for 70M. I'd sell him for 35M
This trying to find the right blend in midfield is ok but you need the level of picks available has to be of a certain standard and that your problem par a very promising 18 year old the rest are poor so finding a good blend is probably beyond your means  at the moment
I can’t take your show seriously with Ricky 🤦🏽
McTom has repeatedly let his man go at the top of the box. We have been stung from it so many times. He is thick as two planks. Zero awareness
Why do our centre halves drop back instead of confronting a striker about to shoot
Rick makes a decent point once a month. Rest is complete dribble !!!
Ricky talks bollocks
Rashford shacks out of challenges, hes a joke.
The fucking players need to take a massive pay cut for the crap they are putting out on a regular basis.
I never get it when the manager is blamed, it’s the players out on the pitch playing crap and turn it on when they want , they need to know they are shite at football and don’t deserve to play for united
Wasn’t elanga and Anthony sold/ bought in different transfer windows ?
mctominay isn't good enough for the championship
You’d be fooled into thinking Mctominay is the son of the Glazers he receives so much hate-the lad is one of the clubs top players on stats -and I know stats can lie but the lad is not the problem-wat was Sancho’s contribution this week for that phat wage🤔
This old man is nuts
Ricky spot on on Bruno. He gives the ball away too much and it puts the team under pressure
The ONLY team in the world that would pay £70Million for rashford...is United...he's worth £30Million max.
Pogba out
Beth better analyze sacking the manager is not the issue    sack some players 😤 😒 😑 🙄 😐  stop talking the same dynamic 😑
A big problem with our players is most are too slow the others are lazy
Dan James is better than Antony.
not family
Abject performance from Rashford
Yesss that jordan is on coucouland for sho ......   speaking no sens at all     not even positive 😒 🙄 😕 😪 what a shame
Ten hag continue doing the same thing expecting a different result. The baldy is out of depth and its visible.
I’d sack ten Hag on our away record alone! Bring back Mourinho and back him properly, not like last time!
Bring back sure 😊
Elanga is miles better than Garnaecho    and Anthony and Rashford  you get most weeks-but unfortunately Elanga is a quiet lad who needs coaching and hype club Utd don’t have a coach and don’t have places for quiet  honest talented lads🤔
No player at any top team has a contract clause to say they cannot be dropped. Bench Antony, Bruno , Rashford and Mc Disaster. PLAY THE YOUNGSTERS MORE MINUTES!!!
Therapy Forum. Love y'all. Happy New Year.
Elanga better than our forward line lmao 🤣 what a joke
MCTOMINAY DOESNT HAVE TACTICAL AWARENESS. RICKY YOU PROTECT THE MIDDLE OF THE PITCH BEFORE ROAMING AT WIDE. RICKY HAS NEVER PLAYED FOOTBALL CLEARLY A 2 V 1 ON OUTWIDE
Ten Hag's worst decision at Utd wasn't a signing or a sub. It was instructing the board to dispense with Rangnick. He was the director of football we needed and horrific recruitment will be what gets Ten Hag fired.
What does Jordan say @53:53 ?
The manager and the players must all be held responsible for the lost , tactical decisions are on the manager, but on the whole everyone should be blamed
This Ricky guy gives you less and less viewers... I would remove him from the show even if he would be Sir Alex
Elanga got his Revenge, he now plays for a Real football club
Listen and listen  you are not athletes and you re are all talking no sens enough     are you truly united fans     better back them up    caused what s for sure you will never have a place on the pitch     jokers😂
Ricky is off his head with the Elanga comment. Elanga is playing well because he is in a system and team that are actually playing good football
Our midfield captain and maestro went awol today. As captain he has to take responsibility for the loss.
You played worse in the first half
The manager clearly has low football IQ Garnacho should of started on the right and Anthony on the left! It worked against Villa perfectly why did he change it! Then the Mctominey sub is just shocking even tho I blame Mctominey himself for that I usually think people are way too harsh on him but he was absolutely pathetic bottling challenges look at Gibbs White hobbling around at the end that's character Scott
Its very simple United have had their pants pulled down overpaying foreign clubs because they panic buy without doing their homework and giving this manager what he wants, someone should have said no to TenHag. McTom is not a number 6 everyone should stop destroying the man, remember he is your top scorer.
NO TOP MANAGER WOULD BE PLAYING MCTOMINAY AT ANY POINT OF A GAME - AND YET WE ARE LETTING DONNY GO ON LOAN - MENTAL!
Who is that jordan ? Talking shhhhhhesssh.      Not am athlete and just blabla...... for saying shhhhhhesssh.     Better hushhhh instead    no excuses for yours lames comments    who is that jordan   what a disgrace he is 😂😂😂😂a joke
Earbridge
Always love Ricky's laugh.
Absolute wisdom from Jordan and Ricky. If only Erik Ten Hag had their insight.
WHEN YOU DOU STUPID IDIOT ERRORE WHEN YOU BUY ONANA=: THIS MEAN YOU DESERVE OUTTTTTTTTTTTT WITH YOUR ONANA AND TACTICS OF TOILETTE
Who are you speaking on Anthony?you re not an athlete?who ate you jordan ? Pouring you are and your name jordan 😅😅😅😅😅you re just a joke . Better better analyze instead of talking shhhhhhesssh
Mark Goldbridge and the United stand When is the penny going to drop that you just cannot, no matter how hard you try polish a turd and thats what Ten Hag is.
You guys find your voices against Antony,but Garnacho,AWB,Varane(terrible on the ball) all get a pass typical lazy analysis
Mark is a p**** u know
The club is rotten and needs a reset. Do I think Ten Hag makes smart choices? No. I never thought him to be the manager United needed. But do I think some players need to go first, before they even think of sacking another manager?absolutely.  A lot has to start changing before you can get a proper manager in this club. Therefore sacking ETH first would be dumb anyway before getting rid of these players.
TO BE HONEST  ( I SEE ONLY FIRST HALF OF THE MATCH ) BECAUSE FIRST HALF WAS SLOW AND WITHOUT SPIRIT,  LIKE CLOWNS THEY PLAY FOOTBALL.  NEXT MATCH IAM NOT GOING TO WATCH NOTHING AT  ( T'EN HAAG LEAVE WITH SOME CLOWNS WE STILL HAVE ON THIS TEAM )
Told ya..  🟨🟧🟥 Bipolar ManU 🟥🟧🟨  ya need to see a shrink 🤏
Happy new year Erik ten Haag 😂
The amount of people who had to give mctomminay a 1/10 for that overall rating is great
This video will be lit...I just know it!
Elanga is better than there forwards atm
The day united decided to separate ways with Rangnick, was the day the "rebuild" died. The person responsible for his decision deserves Minecraft treatment.   Just look what Rangnick did with Austria. He didn't just get the team flying. Typical Rangnick, he changed the whole structure of Austrian youth football, invented youth camps where he personally looks at young promising talent for the national team. Austria now has twice the amount of coaches in training than Germany, a country 6 times the population.   He did all that in what?? 1 1/2 yrs? I feel like this fanbase will never understand how bad his sacking affected us. It threw us back a decade.
From the beginning  of the season I wondered why they sold Fred, Elanga and DeGea. Check my texts. Antony at 85m is a waste. Onana at 50m is a disappointment.  I am for Ten Hag but he has been horrible and too stubborn in his team selections and man- management. PLAY THE YOUNGSTERS AND BENCH THE LOUSY PRIMA DONNAS!!!!!!
THIS TEAM WITH MANAGER = ARE FINISHED.
There are too many average players at United. Average players will only give average results. Nothing will change until those players are gone and sacking Ten Haag won’t change it..
The more ETH picks Antony, the more Sancho’s point is strengthened
ETH honestly said the game was lost in the first half.....which means he's both stubborn and clueless. NO ETH, the game was lost at halftime thanks to your substitution...ETH OUT!
Don Ricky dropping gems❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Elanga and Anthony. It´s almost like the guy that build Hoffenheim, Leipzig and Salzburg from scratch knows more about player evaluation than the guy who had one successful three year coaching stint in 30 years. 🤣🤣
Mark and Eth in ppl, HAVE THAT! Like here if you think Mark and Eth in should swivel on Mark’s middle finger!
Drinking 😭
Belated Christmas gift to neutrals from United. Cheers lads 😂
Should never have fired rangnick, he would never have approved ten hags signings for the price they paid. he was the director of football united needed.
It's not the manager FFS BETH
Have we not lost every game we played in the stupid stripped gear (including pre season)?
😂
