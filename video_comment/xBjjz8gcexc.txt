Actually, if there is a rechargable battery inside the bulb, that is depleted, the battery could recharge itself via the positive terminal of the battery that's in the wall, and the to the the negative end that's inside the bulb. and the bulb turns on during the energy transfer beween the two ends of the battery.
It would have been pretty easy to install a regular light connection since you're two feet from an existing outlet.
Uh, boy...
YAYYYYYYYYY!   NO MORE ELECTRICITY BILLS! 😊
And the battery has what to do with the artful painting again ?
I would love to buy your house! Heres a check for $ 100 bucks😂
maybe he can do a stencil of that light bulb sticking out of his a$$ to show what happened when his wife got home and saw Uncle Fester on the wall.
Ok we all know it wouldn't work.    But wow this guy has to be stopped.   There a plus and switch right below this there a chance somebody could try this ....damage one of the wires and yeah results wouldn't be so wonderful
Sick of this idiot’s cheesy bs clips.
This has to be comedy. Please don’t let this be real.
Do you people realize that he makes these videos knowing that all the "experts" are going to watch them and make their expert opinions known.  They just can't help themselves.
hey ... you're the same lamoid who did the bursting red balloon/mirror ... I can't bring myself to call it a "trick."
American walls are made of paper
Are houses in the US made of cardboard?

As an expert at nothing, I can assure you this is not how lightbulbs work. 🤔
Какие ужасные картонные стены
Do NOT disrespect my man uncle fester like this 🫩
Bull. Shit.
I h8 this fuqn guy
Yeah, I’m gonna do that second later explosion😂
The idea is outstanding It made my day better.

Wait to his wife comes home. That light bulbs going up you know where on him.😅
Looks more like me having to repair drywall and repaint for some stupid bs.
God, you do stupid things.
How do you get the battery back out of the wall?
Don't sell your company to Shark Tank.
Your toy is trash
Are people dumb enough not to know how batteries work.  Theres a positive and negative end.  He’s not completing a circuit
There's Andy
Damn!  Doc Brown looking rough these days...handled too much Plutonium back in the 80's
I want to see the hours of cleanup after one of his projects. Who cleans up his messes, hopefully not the wife....?
I wonder how many quick minded individuals this guy convinced to put a hole in their wall. This is fake. The circuit isnt complete. Its only making contact with 1 end of the battery. And that's a 1.5 volt battery with a 110 volt bulb.
Fun crafts but please don’t call this art
Tell people to hit a battery with a hammer then paint over it. Nothing can go wrong.
ちょっとかわいい
Whats with the battery in the wall?
He put himself on the box 😂😂😂😂
Cute for kids..now your bed covers curtains and walls bathroom will be sprayed all over..such fun😂. It's not a special bulb only magnetic too which mist are...all ledlicht do it without anything since wifi is all over the world so in a house walls because of the many wires that scream electricity (coax, 6g and more everywhere, like a verb) it lights up all your rooms. The implants in your controlled brain too 😂😂😂
Why TF would you put a battery-sized hole in your wall for seasonal decoration!? If you’re that dumb, I have a bridge to sell you.
Must be nice to hammer a large battery into your living room wall with no consequences and then have enough $ to fix it whenever you're tired of looking at your kid's arts & craft project.
Watch the battery fall inside, land on the wiring for those outlets. Goodbye home.
Now, kids can touch a hot light bulb.
Hope it's not a rental lol
now  kids can bash holes in the wall and paint on the wall
Seriously?? IN YOUR HOUSE???
Nice
Only $199.99, with tariffs. Get ‘em before our currency is devalued even more.
How do you replace the battery
PLEASE don't do this to your home!!!  Last thing you need are holes that big in your walls, let alone batteries!
For some reason something is telling me the battery and the light bulb thing doesn’t work like that. Plus the light bulb came on when the camera panned up. How’s that work?
Honestly I think the battery in the wall isn't doing anything other than being a distraction and could easily be replaced with any thing magnetic/metal. I've actually got a light bulb I ordered from Amazon very similar to what I'm sure they are using in the video. These little light bulbs even come with a fake socket to put into a real lamp etc but it's just a little thing that the bulb is easily removed. The bulb can be placed anywhere that a magnet can, I've used it on the side of the bathtub, walls with no plug in's( stick a little coin size removable metal piece anywhere),side of the truck or roof. They are extremely handy to have and you just gotta recharge them once in awhile but if I can get something like this than I'm sure that's what thats being used one of those portable, rechargeable lights with a remote.
In my day kids got beat for doing things like that.  Today they are selling kits and making videos to instruct them to do it.
For kids? I wanted a kit for myself son
Gotta lol at how flimsy American walls are.
お兄ちゃん😂
This guy is always doing stupid shit
I think he's sadistic?
As a Julliard trained electrician... why is there a hole I'm my wall
SMDH 🤦 I don't even know where to start. If even 1 person hammers a battery into their wall because of this...
You are advertising something for kids but then lying about how the bulb works. Kinda stupid.
Who spray paints inside their house.
Loser
Who knew wheat meat had made it's way back from the 80s?!  But why did they name it after the devil?
E se acabar a pilha🤨?
WANKSY
センスなさすぎだろ ちゃんと壁直しといてね
どうやって電灯 消すんだろう…
Neat, but you need to have the positive and the negative connected to light the bulb, touching one end just is not going to work. I have seen that bulb before and it has a battery built in it.
You used yellow paint. Didn't see it on the finish. Bold faced liar
American walls are like paper!
A+ for effort. F- for results. And a🐂💩for extra credit.
ﾏｯﾏ「あんた壁こんなんして！！」

Y si se acaba la pila
appello: non vi fate di acidi, fa male. la droga fa male, ripetiamo tutti insieme: la droga fa male 😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The battery is in the bulb. Hammering a battery in the wall did nothing but put a roughly right sized hole in the wall.
Go for it kids! Destroys those walls all in the name of art🤦‍♂️
У него вся квартира из картона?
Oh Lord! Every mother's nightmare! 😂
Errr excuse me but that ain’t Uncle Fester, Oh no, that’s a brilliant actor that “reprised” the role, there will only ever be 1 Uncle Fester,   THE ORIGINAL !
Hey he made the guy from the show
People please don't do this to your walls.
20:55 okay tupac 😻
People really need to watch some Addams Family...
Battery: I'M STUCK IN THIS WALL FOR ETERNITY NOW
YouTube se está convirtiendo en una plataforma maligna para el ser humano
Cool concept! But a couple issues.  Great idea to sell an everything included set for kids BUT adult kits would be so much more fun and become phenomenal sellers. Plus adults are allowed to use spray paint without supervision lol.  Lastly, the link you provided takes you directly to its sell page on the Walmart site for a reasonable price tbh. But since I don’t live in the states an option popped up asking if I wanted to shop Canadian 🇨🇦 or American 🇺🇸 Walmart. This product, actually no products by this brand are sold in Canada. You’re cutting off a huge portion of sales. Just thought you should know.
Oh, my god, American walls are literally just two sheets of paper glued together, aren’t they!
His house is gonna be filled with spray paint
Your wall is in paper?
People, don’t do this.
しょうもな
That is an awesome uncle fester and if I were a single man I would definitely do this in my house, but if I did do this right now I would definitely be single. My wife would choke me out in my sleep if I did this hahaha. Great job bro!!
😂😮😮😮😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😮😮
Very creative😊❤
That is sick you're really talented. 👍
OH UNCLE FESTER FROM ADDAMS FAMILY OF WEDNESDAY BECAUSE HE GIVES ELECTRIC
For a second, I thought it was tombstone from Spider-Man
Voldemort?
Scam 💩
spraying the battery is stupid it can cause fires
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂كل زج كل خير
WAIT IS THAT UNCLE FESTER FROM WEDNESDAY/ADDAMS FAMILY LMAOO😂😂😂
Parrents are going to kill you
i did not like this video.  sure I could just stay silent and go about my day, but...   if you have a bone to pick with me for leaving a (very mild) negative comment, remember that I am increasing engagement which actually helps the video to get bigger which ofc helps the creator...  whose video I don’t like, at all. the jerky editing, the inclusion of an entire commercial, uncle fester - it's all terrible
Ok the paint stencil kit is genius, kids will have a blast. I loved them when I was young
When I was a kid I remember having the blow pens from the 90s tv commercial ad such a nostalgic moment ❤
This is fake for so many reasons just so many reasons also thumbs down for the added music
💡😲  Fester mester nagybácsi annyira csodálatos,hogy elég őt a falra festeni,és a villanykörte így is működik! 🤣

Из чего стены? Это игрушечный дом?
Hah american wall😂😂
Energizer
Love that you have released kits in stores, however, I'm in Australia!! And I'm not a kid 😂
So the bulb is antigravitic and can transmit low voltage through layers of paint? That end of the battery is positive only, there are no threads on it to hold the bulb, what gives?
american walls xDDDDDDD
I thought battery will explode, then i realized that wall is american
P diddy
I t is not a German wall 😂😂
Какие у вас в Америке дома картонные)
Wo kriegt die Birne denn den Minus-Pol her?
Swear this guys house is just made entirely by plasterboard lol
For those who ask why the walls of houses in the USA are so thin and fragile, it is forbidden to build brick houses there, only large buildings with many floors are built from bricks and concrete. Regarding the light bulb, it glows from a small battery hidden inside the case.

I love it
I love the Addams Family.
That turned put grwat!
I like this😂🎉
POS ad. Cool
I'm sorry but why? Like, I'm not the smartest with this stuff, but spray painting on a battery and letting that battery sit in a hole in the wall doesn't really seem like a good idea?
Er sollte besser achten, dass die Figuren wirklich schön mittig sind... würde mich stressen- fiel mir schon bei den letzten zwei Videos auf...  Aber diese Ideen immer - fantastisch!

Not smart pushing that battery into the wall directly above an outlet.
tyhis guy kinda is really annoying. he does dumb stuff to his house for views when most of the stuff he does it totally fake and couldnt possibly work
Fake the light can't come on there is not enough voltage  and only one contact is touching
The music?

This would be awesome if it wasn't for the battery lie.
i remember the movies and the cartoon LOL, Fester did that in Addams Family Values
I AM THE KID. THAT IS LITERLY MY FATHER
Ну, Вы серьезно?
What material is the wall made of? Styrofoam?
Battery corroding in wall? Nice

It sounds like you used the music from the Google game with the black cat sorcerer from a few years ago. Love it!
Nice watch!

What the hell are walls in the United States made of. They look so weak.
Why a battery
Why he always broke his house
It's perfect for Halloween 🎃 especially that character
Fétide Adams.❤❤
“You guys asked for this…” no. No nobody asked for this.
Okay and what are you going to do with it when it's Christmas
Who’s uncle fester?
I love that you made a kids set but what about making an adult set for people that really wanna do exactly what you’re doing but are not kids that would be awesome❤
❤😂🎉
No ones gonna talk about the random dog in his frontyatd?😂
Wow. So much better than learning art.
False advertisement, when promoting the kit your sell, use only the kit, stop using real spray paint. I know why you do it but the little one don't. Have integrity.
I love that moive
but why
La solidité des murs américains 🤦🏻🤣
I like ❤❤❤❤
Uncle Fester was always my favorite ❤️
❤🔬
This guy makes money doing this crap. There's something very wrong with the world.
Someone should show this man how a battery works, I'm a Middle schooler and even I know this is fake because batteries don't work that way
I was really scared in the beginning but then I remembered american walls.
how do you change the batteries
Me: oh I wanna try it! Me: .....I think I mest up..... the lines don't match
I thought it was the food critic from ratatouille for a second!🤣😭
I ain't got no beef with you but why do you put holes in your walls
I tried this my battery exploded and my house burnt down so I’m thinking I messed something up
Dude, you're walls are crap. Probably only one layer of the thinnest and cheapest drywall available 🤦🏻‍♂️
Me when I thinked it was thanos: 💀
Question how is it going to work if the battery runs out of power
Calling that a wall ... lol
Bro is not selling the house anytime soon.
l though it's was the rock
Are those in all provinces and cities
Once that battery has no more energy Ur cooled😂
Wouldn't the battery just fall through the hole in the wall?
Bro is just trying to be a cool dad😢
Has any body ever realized that this dude house is quite literally disneyworld
How many walls do you have in your house?
I want some of your art man. I truly do.
Oh, btw, what do you do when the battery dies, 🤔
Omg, ive been ⌚ ng your video for an hour. My lester is sleeping and i was bored. What can i say, i am going to need a fester soon cause I'm addicted to your art.😂
bros house is a museum 😂
Does bro know that his kids will grow up
Battery runs out💀💀💀
😂😊
What are the people after you move out going to think of this house
Can it be on amazon too
Stop ruining your house
😮❤
I respect the desire to hide "the trick" to the bulb, but teaching people to hammer a battery against their wall is NOT a....bright idea.
but....why?
Uhhh
does this affect the value of your house???? just curious
They might as well move when his kids grow up there’s no fixing that house
I’m sorry, I’m not from America so I can’t buy it. I’m from Portugal and I’m about to get a baby chicken so I can’t get it sorry bye
Good this guys a TOOL
what are your walls made of?
I thought it was the rock Johnson
Aaaaaannndd that’s a battery…fun
Rip battery you’ll never be missed😢
It is fake you need 120 V to light up a lightbulb. A battery is only 1.5 V
Was I the only one that expected the battery to explode when he first hit it?
were are the kits
Le dessin est bien fait mais en tout cas il ment au niveau de l'ampoule car une pile ne peut pas faire fonctionner une ampoule surtout que d'un côté il faudrait au moins déjà le plus et le moins mets en fait il met une pile dans un mur et l'ampoule comme ça et elle s'allume ça déjà c'est un mensonge car vous pouvez essayer avec n'importe quelle pile ça va pas marcher et ni avec n'importe quelle ampoule et on voit bien qu'à la fin que l'ampoule est relié à un contacteur car il peut allumer et éteindre l'ampoule sans la toucher😂
Battery falls out of sight! Battery inside of lightbulb maybe. Driving battery easily through drywall? I don’t think so!
I wanna get one for my lil niece Wrd 👍🏽
is a Wednesday bro....😂😂😂....
I don't think they have those in Florida
Who the heck ever asked for that?!?
I am not from Lebanon
Landlords love every wall done just like this. Trust me bro!!
Your balls are made out of cardboard
That’s not how batteries work! It’s fake
Can't wait to use the bathroom at midnight 😅
hitting a lithium battery with a hammer is a bad idea.
I see a dog
What happens when the battery goes flat  tho
Why not is a proper light fitting instead of damaging the wall with a battery?
Dangerous

So dumb
Я:повторяю дома.Не расщитоваю толщину стены бью из зо всех сил по батарее. Соседи:вот и дома не кого

The bulb has the battery. That D cell has nothing to do with it!
Keep crashing the house.
Awesome bro, that's pretty god
Yeah....... that ain't gonna work, its like central heating,  electricity needs flow and return.

Have you ever made a mistake in your drawings?❤
Что у него за стена такая? Почему он смог пробить стену батарейкой?
How did hammering the battery right into the drywall not spider it and why didn’t it drop into the framing??? 🧐
DONT BULB NEED 2 POINTS TO CONNECT ? I BEEN Chucked OUT FOR WALL DAMMAE LOL it screws du
Из чего там стены??? из фарфора что ли?
Over here in Germany you would need a drilling machine to drill a hole into the wall (mostly made out of bricks or concrete) before putting something in it....

Is that really… a wall ?  How ?! What have I just seen ?!
Bros house is paper
You can't do that in germany
How thin are your walls?!?!
В Америке у всех стены из бумаги?😅
why the wall is like a paper.😥😨💀
Why you keep on doing holes in perfectly good walls I get if it already have a hole but you don’t have to make one
Do you live in South Carolina?
What a waste of a perfectly good wall !!!!
Стены из говна зделаны
I thought it was the Mr. Incredible from the "people who know" memes. 😂😂😂
Well, yes, to make the light bulb light up you don't need to close the contacts. Very realistic.
Из чего их дома сделаны? Чуть ударил и дырка в стене
Seriously bro stop destroying your house
Why was i expecting the battery to explode...
Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. You’d have to screw/unscrew that stupid bulb every time. Very dumb.
unfortunately for you, it takes more than one and a half volts and at least two contacts for the light bulb to burn

You guys have hollow walls
This guy has destroyed his house with these botch jobs everywhere
You lose about 12 batteries because they keep falling through your paper thin sheet rock. Also don't you have to connect both ends of the battery to the light bulb or is this guy a wizard?
After watching a multitude of this mans videos I have precisely assessed his home value as much less than he started with.
What you're going to do with that sense october ended Cut everything you be doing this amazing And i'm curious
IM FUCKING MIND BLOWN! excuse my language
Q mierd
Dumbest idea ever also
Daddy what do you do for work, well honey i dont know exactly but i know the hole world thinks are family is stupid but hey we have alot of money now so thats a plus
Hes too afraid to use his own product and instead opted to use spraypaint. 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
Еще немного, и от дома ничего не останется
uncle fester looks like quan chi
Why must you ruin everything
Spróbuj wbić taką baterię w polskim domu. W Polsce dajemy zbrojenie( tona na metr2) do murów domu, a każda ściana ma 3 metry grubości i jest wylana c50.  Byłem w tym USA, przejechałem jak i przeleciałem wzdłuż i wszerz, trzeba napisać otwarcie, że u was to bida. Kto to widział bezdomnych na ulicy, tyle ćpunów. USA to trup na kroplówce.
Ну и стены у вас. Пальцем проткнуть можно.
Если стены так легко батарейкой прошибаются, боюсь представить, что с домом станет, если град пойдëт)
Че бля за бумажные стены?!
Каждый раз я угараю что за кортонный домик они готовы выложить по 200-350к баксов.
Какие стены ватные
Из чего у него стены? 😂
wait - no way?
Только от + лампочка горит???
I thought it was the rock
What the hell😂 his house is full of set he easly put hole on everywhere
At first I thought it was brutes from fortnite 😂
Junk
Wonder what else you can put in that hole besides a battery...
Did anyone else notice the dog in the background
Nice big lenny painting.
the fake light  shyte makes me hate his art.
Landlords must love him💀
A simple before and after pic would have worked. And I immediately knew you were doing Fester
This guy is always destroying his house!
This guy doesn’t live in a house, he lives in an ART GALLERY
Wow this is fake
Bro won't have a house in a few more drawings
If I do that in Germany the battery breaks😂 Here the walls are made of solid concrete
А з чого стіни такі крихкі😂
Stupid. Can’t stand this idiot
This man really loves destroying his own house
Hier in Österreich wirst du mit deiner Batterie nicht weit kommen XD
Do you owning your own drywall business or have a guy on standby ready to repair your daily endeavors?
Don't use lithium
O sırada ev çatlayıncagelen pişmanlık hissi  The feeling of regret when the house cracks
壁壊す時の「ポコッ」って言う感じ好きwww
C cell battery? Aren't they on the endangered species list?
First put a hole in drywall can you use spray paint on an indoor wall now how are you going to get the battery out knowing you you just put a bigger hole in the wall another low IQ moment brought you by a mouth breather😂
The black is out of registration.
Sonic please
Why does this man hate drywall 😂
These are dumb
When you have white privilege, you can do this type of shit
Vayaa pared de mierda 😅
Can we have a Home toro
Can we hav
what a waste of a D battery
He's magnificent 😊
Video: hits battery Reality: nuke explosion
I'm sure the wife just loves Uncle Fester in her kitchen.
Hank?
How to start a house fire
IQ = -3
This dude needs to stop
That would not work with paint on the battery
This is BS, you gotta have both terminals to make it work. Why do people put up bogus content and try to pass it off as legit?
Giannahrose
wow Heihachi Edajima isn't it?
Artistic Genius 👏😎 at work 😉
Dr evil?
Из чего сделаны эти дома? Из говна и палок?
Ok this ones pretty good
Bro trying to get his bag to fix all the damage he's doing to his house
I hate just watching his houses value plummet to the ground in these vids.
Shit fake
Bro I was literally gonna say, “This guy has so many fuckin holes in his wall” but everyone got it covered 😂
Don’t worry, there’s plenty of brown uncle Fester in the cornbread room
It’s gunna be lookin real awkward during Christmas
Having used batteries for a number of years now, I can affirm they work best when their ends are covered with layers of spray paint.
Too much bullshit gimmicks
That's an external wall lmao?
For todays lesson kids, lets hammer a battery.
His whole house has art on it
Flashover is this
Ur house must be covered in spray paint
This person comes up with cool ideas 💡
Что? Это как? Как ты умудрился молотком и батарейкой сломать стену в доме? Если я ударю молотком по батарейке в своем доме - у меня просто лопнет батарейка, потом сломается ручка у молотка, а уже после всего этого... Порвуться обои. Чтобы снести стену тебе нужна минимум кувалда
Whats holding the battery from falling into the wall?
Voldemort
I thought it will be the rock or heavy
Wow it worked,, NOT
Your wife gonna kill you for doing this! 😂
Did anyone else  see the heavy from team fortress at first?
This dude is a genius
My next trick is called our house is on fire
This guys house has more holes than a hedgehogs pillow
Garca
Them: look at our house! Me when i see the house all cartoon:.....
All your videos are Ass
when the layers get miss-aligned:  the guy: honey! D E S T R O Y T H E W A L L
I’m living in Europe and with 100% I can say that battery would explode coz we have good walls not from paper
Would love to have a dad like this guy.
They will need to bulldoze their house if they ever decide to sell it
1. La pared se ve manchada por tu mala punteria durante todo el proceso, menos en la toma final... Magia!! 2. Las baterías no funcionan conectando 1 solo polo... MAGIA!! 3. No usas el airbrush que trae tu juego, seguro también funciona por MAGIA.
I live in Windhoek,Namibia
What if the battery doesn't work anymore? I mean how will you get it out?
AWESOME, I LOVE THIS GUY. ALWAYS COMING UP WITH CRAZY WICKED COOL STUFF. I THINK WOW HE'S WRECKING HIS WALL, NOPE MASTERPIECE! 👊👍
Prob you have art all around your house
Of course I'm not a pro, but it's better not to knock on batteries with a hammer  Я, конечно, не профи, но по батарейкам молотком лучше не стучать
Is this Billie Eilish?
Kids would be beaten if they spray painted stencils on their walls 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I used to have stencil kits like that with blow pens/markers
I wonder what the house price is and how much it has dropped from these videos💀
Idiot
Would never work
i know your landlord is tired of you
DO NOT HAMMER BATTERIES! How is this warning not on the video?!
The battery isn't grounded to complete a circuit.
bru
So that lightbulb doesn't require that battery and you just rammed a battery into your wall for no reason
this guy will never be able to sell his house
He is litterly 2nd best dad
Brain rot
So overtime the battery is going to leak. Straight into the electric outlet below it. Causing corrosion. With the possibility of fire.
Lo de que las paredes en america sean de papel es una cosa.... xD
Why?!?!?! Shit fucking walls
i hate this guy so much x_x
I don't live in Europe but my walls wouldn't break that cleanly.  You pre-cut that hole.
This man really upsets me
Yeah, battery goes into the wall, proceeds to drop to the floor. (inside the wall) Please...
I loveeeeeee Harry potter please ? I am french !
For the love of god people, don't beat a battery with a hammer, if your going to do this do the smart thing, get a wooden dowel the same circumference of the battery and hit that with a hammer, not the item that could break open dump acid and possibly start a fire inside your walls.
Как уних дом вообще выгледит а не понемаю лол
Attention guys!!  I'm from South Africa🇿🇦 I really wanna know, why the walls in America be that thin or ??
What is that wall? Paper lol?
Yasssssssss SLAY 👏👏👏👏
This is bollocks.
That’s actually a great idea. I used to be an artist and we’d use stencils to make graffiti or street art. They’re so easy to create. I could take literally any image and make a perfect stencil in maybe an hour max. Cool they did this for kids in a marketable way. Hope it sells well man!
Этот человек снова ломает свой дом.
Brooo you’re literally ruining your house just to make it look goofy!
Even though we use cement board here in the u.s, no way that battery would be able to just be tapped in with so little effort and make a perfect hole lol. Looks cool though
So are we all going to pretend that we don't know how DC currents work?
How dumb do you have to be
u dumbass dad quit ur job u dumb bitch go for the milk and never come back u big ass shit i wonder what ur wife think about ur insurance i want her cause she got them yeeks u dumb destroying ur house for some dumb kids u typical white people
Didn’t they catch you getting your cheeks clapped by diddy
this guys house must look like a shit show
Dad:I'm gonna fix that hole in the wall son: what hole dad:😏🕳 🔨🔋
Тупо
As soon as he did the outline and the bulb I knew it was going to be Fester 👌
what material they use for their walls? paper?
Well i can't get my midnight snack with this on
Very crappy wall. Styrofoam apparently.
Wow❤❤❤😂😂😊
Forget the kids what about the adult stencils 😊😊
Is that The Rock? Lol 😂 🪨
Ну и паршивые у вас стены..ужас
So the toy shown is just a new school color blaster .
Bull fucking shit
Dude how did that battery go through wtf is your house made of? Air? Playing cards? Hopes and dreams?
Волк придет и сдует ваши дома😅
Bullshit
Can I order some?Because my mom says we don't like your money.And we don't live near that place.So I just wanna know.Can we cause my mom said we live in Africa tonight.No we do so can you
Vaya tonterías hace éste hombre
I swear,  the wall is made of cardboard
Looks stupid! I'm sure most women would be okay with it
I love uncel fester
Wow Excellent 😊😊😊😊
Pretty hard
The absolute state of american walls
Dude is selling stencils he didnt even create 😂
That’s why Banksy is lame and stencils are are so easy kids can do it.    TEAM ROBBO
my dumbass really thought that was the rock 💀💀
At first I thought it was Dr. Evil
Me:why is he smacking battery on the wall My dumb brain: Oh I know he is powering the wall!
I'm pretty sure ElectroBoom wouldn't approve this.
Every time I see him do this it just reminds me of Infamous Second Son
Блин как у вас легко стена крошится 😂
His wife must support his unconventional ideas about what makes a peaceful relaxed home😂
Not very good walls 😂😂😂
The algorithm really loves this dude destroying his house
داداش خونه ات چقدر ضعیفه به هرجا دوتا چکش بزنی سوراخ میشه؟؟😢😂😂😂

Low key con artist

Property value 👇
American houses are made from paper!
I hate that I watch these
What is name of art
Destroy the wall for some dumb stencil
Thats really cool something i would do
The buildquality of this House is a joke.
As a certified electrician I’m here to say this is bull crap 😂😂😂

I didn't realize it was Fester until layer 3 Straight up thought it was Heavy Weapons Guy from TF2
اون دیوار بود یا کره بود
Que cojone pero si es el comandante lara nove que guapo
I like the black stencil edge marks you briefly showed us.
I thought it was gonna be the rock
The light bulb would not work as there is no circuit made through drywall
Sickkkk
How is bros wall so easy to break
Sweetness
the entire downstairs has to be repainted now and this is a horrific fire hazard.
This guy all fake
Is he the one that's on the air brush box?
I am Italian and I have houses made of concrete not plastic
I’m wondering how thick the sheet rock is all over your house ,   Probably the thinnest one
The king of shitty art
Фестер Адамс 😅😅😅😅😅
American wall 😂 what a shit
Serm ti se u zid!!!😮
انقدر که دیوار سوراخ کرد هیش کی نکرد😂
How do you do the stencils

Do us all a favor and stop what you’re doing
Почему у них все стены из картона, вот что как, а поголовно у всех американсов я вижу ток такие стены,ппц,
I already knew it was uncle fester, just off of the shape of the image alone lol.
У них стены из бумаши
This guy knows absolutely nothing about physics, so his light bulb works purely on magic. P.S. The light bulb, rated for an operating voltage of 220-230V AC, works on 1.5V DC, and on top of that, it doesn't even have a neutral connection
Just why
I tought it was heavy weapons guy
Fuck your Stencil kit
Cartoonboard walls
Mano essa casa é feita de quem é feita de cupim só pode e de aço o que eu já vi ele furar várias vezes vários lugares e ainda não caiu essa casa
Case USA

This MF loves putting holes in his wall
What is the wall made out of? Paper?
I knew it was him from just the first spray painted layer
One of the best one's you have
As an America. Human I hate us
You are the number 1 troll in the world
That is fake the battery is only 1.5 volts a light bulb needs about 250 volts of electricity
It won’t work it has to be fake because It needs to be a loop to continue To light up
Попробовал сделать это в России... батарейка сплющилась, на стене ни вмятины 😂😂😂
wall?   Where are the solid walls. You can't live inside glorified cardboxes
Undorító
Hello
Hello
I seen this dude at a Diddy party the video is crazy hahahaha bro ur sick
This is the same thing as spreading misinformation, if it’s meant to be funny it’s not at all. You can tell this guy has never had a day of proper building done in his life. Every single video he makes is cringey to the max. Some of the worst content on YouTube if you can even call it content. The guy just needs to stop.
Unc Fester😂
fake as ****
I call bullshit
Madonna ragazzi i muri di cartapesta americani
You painted on the wall

Cool story bro... don't hammer a battery...
“It looks awful and now the kitchen stinks like spray paint for a week.”
Why are american walls just so crapy? 😂😂
А у вас тоже стены из говна и палок сделаны
Flop magic
Blud loves destroying his wall
There's a fine line between smart and stupid
You know what they say if you love running your home camera a battery in the wall
Hai disegnato tutta casa😂

Brooo your house gas taken a tole
Why tho
Police: So what was the cause of the fire start? Fireman: well uncle Fester wouldn't stop doing his light bulb trick.
an open circuit magically becomes completely just by touching the positive side? 😂
this shit is going too far.
I am disappointed by the absence of glory hole jokes. You guys don’t even internet.
La locura se pega. Sabias que los científicos en algún momento lo han tildado de loco la locura y la inteligencia son hermanos gemelos cuidado te podría confundir.
Fake
He's certainly somebody's uncle😂
That’s fake how a battery 🪫 that it’s not connected directly to the lightbulb it’s going to turn on ? And where’s the switch ? Etc it’s just BS
Bro battery did not sit while you screwed it in. No negative. A lot wrong here. Quit scamming people because your sponsored
We can all say that we thought that he was spraypanting Shrek
So stupid
He paints over the end of the battery and expects anyone gullible enough to believe that battery was powering the light bulb.
Ok but the fact he puts it on so perfectly 😭✋
First off, who tf is asking to do lame stincels that a grown man tries to look fun. You got issues...I skip your videos everything. Annnd an airbrush uses spray paint, dumb.
Почему в америке такие тонкие стены?
If u believe this.... YOUR STUPID
Why destroy a wall to... nah I'm not even... dunno
Some kid will try this and...  (tap tap tap-) (BOOM)
What's ur job dad dad:i paint and break the house for views

This house has the lowest resale value📉📉
Case Americana😂😂😅😂😅😂😂😂😂 Sono ita
What happens when the battery dies?
Hola.     Ñññññññññññ
Thats….   Thats not how batteries work…
iam just amazed that he's finding these spots in his house to paint😅
When he realizes he has to change the battery
Is that man was John Sina?
Can I get a tour of your house?
Yeah, this looks like a really good way to burn your house down.😂 terrible idea.
People are so creative
How close the Electronic circle from + to - 😅
This guy is so annoying
good infomercial.
Firefighters must not like this guy very much
Bro what are you gonna do when its Christmas lol break the whole wall
I hate this channel so much
This guys is a major dbag… just go away goober
Bro just re invented blow pens
this sucks
The most useless shit on the internet
What's the song called when he was painting it
Perfect Idea!  Much Success!
This is a shit wall
This guy always destroys his house and thinks it looks good b/c of the stencil😂😂😂.
Its a blow pen bro...
This guys house must be so fucked up. Every room has the most random ass bulshit
Su casa debe ser una exposicion de arte Xd
Now that is frickin' AWESOME. The kit too!
Americans and their weirdly thin walls
Shameless plug, that’s disgusting and so is your house
Sus padres jamás los disciplinaron, verdad? 😂😂😂😂
But this won't work so easily. Maybe you need to put the light bulb only to one side ,but the battery needs a + and -
Häuser in Amerika sid abnders😂
That literally cannot work you paintednover the contact its a 1.5v batt 220v bulb batt is dc bulb ac and its not even touching the other contact
This guy is irritating.
I wonder why, since he advertises his product anyway, he didn't use the air brush from the set.
Les américains et leurs maisons en carton 🤣
Anyone else just skip to the end because this fuck just plays too much
is that a wall of paper ? i cant even break my wall with full power gas tank
muricah wall simulator. demolishion DLC
I live in Europe and there is not chance of this working because here we have walls made out of cement
casual American houses, wall get destroyes by a battery
Or you could have more of an intelligence and actually wire it up
“How did the electrical fire start?”
This guy is single-handedly responsible for the worst content on the internet
Thanks for cleaning up the over spray this time
I’m getting a lot for myself 😂😂😂 Laughing but Serious!
That guy reminds me of Nosferatu
Have fun changing the battery
Those light bulbs don't need a battery lol  Just pressure
Weak ahh walls
His flo-whatever kit for kids, is just a remake of the 90s blowpens
😮😮😮
I thought it was gonna be shrek at first
Man’s house must look like one of those county fairs you see in a small town once or twice but never again.
Total bullshit!!!
Lame
How the heck did the battery work without a closed circuit? Either I don't actually know how batteries work or this is BS.
Poor landlord
Hydro dip another guitar badly like a goof. Or how about doing another video and then keep saying how your about to reveil something while you just keep dragging it out and talking. It totally doesn't make me despise you 🌈 🦄
this man trickd yall ! MAGIC !
This guy has to own a house that specifically for doing these clips there's no way he lives in a house with so many paintings and destroyed walls, etc. lmao
Neanderthals
Great so now my kid can spray paint stupid shit on the walls and think it’s decorating
Mmmm yummy spraypaint fumes
Notice he didn’t use that shitty airbrush gun
American wall 😂😂
At first I thought it was the rock
I hate this guy
Damn, that battery just went straight through the wall 😂
What happens when the battery dies? I don’t think you can get that out of the wall.
Looks like uncle fester with a lightbulb in his mouth. Very impressive!
That light bulb, all you gotta do is short the contacts, no battery needed
POV a guest comes over
❤
How do you do that😮
Ruined the wall rot in hell
How many walls does he have available to do all the art he does
What are your walls made of my dude  i would be scared in a storm😮😮
Fake the circle wasn’t compleed
Insurance claim on that house fire is gone now
Does he think he invented this? Hasn't that kit been around since the 80's?
So my dude, you better take this down or add an amendment before someone from your city sees it. Hitting a battery of a wall is actually against the law because it violates fire code and building code. You can get around this with a sulfate ion battery instead of a lithium ion battery , it has a less likely chance to catch everything on fire, but there is another option where you can get flame retardant plastic and put it where the battery is as a casing and then you’re good. But just hitting a battery for video into your wall is going to raise a lot of alarms with your city council. Because the second battery explodes due to overheat or over cooling, the acid can start melting the wall until the insulation catches on fire. You just put a certain type of plastic polymer around it. You’re good or you know use a different kind of battery that’s less likely to go boom.
When Halloween pass your cooked
Ich wunder mich immer wieder wie schnell eure Wände nachgeben :D
Yes because every parent is going to buy something that encourages their children to paint on the walls and make holes in dry wall

How are you going to change the battery😅
Blopens would like a word 😂😂
My first thought was, “ there goes the deposit “ 😂
Im glad i dont do dumb shit to my house and act my age
so you're teaching kids to put holes in walls at their parents homes?
Это скала джонсан!!!!!
Try that at a German wall 😂😂
Ma questo la casa ce l'ha di carta?
Delete this garbage now
What kind of abomination of a wall is that which can be broken with a battery
Good luck selling that house 😂
Это самая идиотская и безвкусная херня которую я только видел
Stupid

How is the battery powering the light?
Wanna see a cool trick. I defy the laws of well basically the universe and turn a light bulbs on with only one side of a battery 😂
Bro stop destroying your house 😭🙏
Where can i buy something like that?
Why does no one call you out for saying you hate n words
Just put the fries in the bag bro 😊
This guy does the dumbest shit
I thought it was h*tl*r
Bhai ghar ambuja sement se bna😂
Have fun with the house fire
NEVER HAMMER A BATTERY- and that was a self-contained LED bulb anyways.
Looks like this guy went from making fake videos where he's doing something off screen and the people he's going to prank are like 10 feet away. Completely ridiculous and stupid.
мда амереканские стены
American homes are made of cardboard. No wonder people use them as a sketchbook
Seems like a fire hazard
Bro I thought this was gonna be the uncanny mr incredible
Ya.......but why 🤔
He was first creating it I thought it was Dr evil 💀💀💀
Funny enough like he gets hate for doing this shit but it’s really creative I’ll give you that like imagine going to his house that’s a story you’d tell someone and they wouldn’t believe you
meth heads be like
This is not how electricity works it needs to be connected to both sides of the battery
Wait till he has to replace the battery
His landlord must loove him
I hate this guy
I just want to know where you get the stencils… like the Marvel ones.. I’ve asked but no one has ever shared 😢
Let’s see our uncle fester 🫥
By now this guy just threw away his security deposit
Im so annoyed by his videos i just said in my head "what the hell are you doing this again for how do u still have wall space" in my most annoyed inner voice
U’re so stupid
He has put so many holes in floors, walls, ceilings,  and counters, I have lost count. Just waiting for his house to fall apart 🤪
Man's a tweaker  with money and access  to stencils and paint
Uncle fester from the Addams family
Get your electrical checked ASAP. Batteries shouldn't do that.
Thought it was tf2 heavy
I don’t wanna be the party pooper but that looks like a VERY bad fire hazard
How he gonna replace the battery
Oh good God never ever ever absolutely never   You're looking to just light up your fucking house
What type of toy is the pencil? An adults toy?
Dude is fucking annoying even if I give thumbs down and ask not to show his channel I still get his videos.
Y stupid now, when kids see this video and get the kid, they're gonna start putting the holes and their parents wall because of some adult on tV I see a lawsuit in the future 😂
At this point, this guy’s house has to look like an abandoned factory with 90000,000 spray-painted pictures on the wall
Every time i see this guy i skip to the end
This guy is an idiot.
I swear, every segment of his house has a hole in it. He had to at least do 500 of these
So paint drys up and stays Halloween does not
This guy is so creepy
Bro doesn’t know how to battery…
How does the battery complete the circuit?
Weird ad
Such a douche
You could have just used a battery operated light bulb
Yeah i'm pretty sure nobody asked
Why do you make art videos then weird videos where you pretend to prank one of your wives by sticking her to a chair or something when she’s clearly in on it?😂or like stupid “hacks” where you “dye a T-shirt” by rubbing paint on it in a pool and pretending it looks cool?? So weird I thought you fizzled out? Well I kinda hoped….how many spray paint craps can you do
Hey, it’s that guy who was dating that disgusting parasite of a woman on TikTok, and would film her doing horrible things
The reason why it fitting is because the Wednesday Addams movie he has electric powers
What happens if the battery dies
Id love to be his handyman, id be rich with the repairs he would need to do to that house 😂
That house's value: 📉
I was right 😊
We need a tour of this guy’s house💀
Isn't that the same as Blo-pens 😂
POV:Halloween ends 💀
What happened if you’re sell the house🤨🛩🏢🏢😩😩😩😩😩😩😩🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
Uncle Lloyd!!!!😂😂😂😂
Uncle Lloyd!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This looks sick!  𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐭
cancer content
I wonder how many kids are going to drop a battery into the hole they made. I'm guessing all of them.
Me personally I would never destroy my house just for views
When was this 😊😇🙂✨️
I thought he was making big Randy for a sec💀
Don't ever hit battery with a hammer it can explode. This guy's an idiot. And absolutely 100% this WILL NOT WORK. You cant just rouch random ends there has to be a complete circuit for the electricity to flow and the light to work
what is this guy cookin up this time
Correction: its a bomb in the wall.
If your airbrush is so great why didn’t you use it? 😅
What a fuckin dumb video 🤡🤡 100% American 🤮🤮🤮
Cool!
We don’t have enough money for painting… let’s start the 5 minute crafts ah moment
The dog
Imagine being the wife just yep this is okay
Bro just gave parents another reason to hate buying there kids these toys that can fuck up there house😂😂😂😅
When he dies, his house will be a gallery
Cool until the battery runs out. How you gonna get it out without it falling into the wall?
The dog
Bros landlord is NOT okay 😂 (unless he has a house)
Aww man, the silhouette in the beginning looked like heavy from tf2. Really hoped it would be hin
You just ruined your nice kitchen
Your wall make out of paper?
Do you just have a bunch of things spray painted around the house?
I dont even think this dude is real, im about 95% sure his entire online presence is a facade to fuel his monetary value
Halloween only a day tho
Zap zap zap zap zap
Please stop.
If youre gonna try to sell us something dont put in a random lie about something else
this is so fucking stupid, yea lets shove a battery in the drywall
Just thought I’d mention, DO NOT spray paint in a poorly ventilated space like a house without a respirator. Those fumes can  REALLY mess you up. This man most likely will have lung cancer, due to the amount of spray paint he uses in his house.
This was a guy when he was 13 drew on the walls
Now change the battery i dare you
Thing is, the lightbulb needs to be connected to both ends of the battery
American solid walls...
Not sure why but my kid started taking batteries and a hammer and beating them into the walls.🤔
My daughters will love this
Fire hazard
Gay val Kilmer at it again
He's never getting the safety deposit back
How can the light come on from the D frr well  without a circuit being closed?  The light must already have its own small power source (watch battery?)
win   dad says i can fiks it
When is he gonna do when the battery dies
Bro if your gonna destroy your house at last make Shure there’s no overspray.
If you go from the 40% red bar to the 90% red bar: You can skip all his yapping. yw
He doesnt need an oscar, he needs money to fix the hole.
Please never do that again with the battery 🙏😅, seriously if you hit it wrong the lithium and copper might touch and an exothermic reaction might occur causing it to heat up catch fire and eventually explode.
I had one of those air brush marker things like 10 years ago
How much holes do you have in your house
How is an air brush not spray paint!?
Hell yea!
I did it to an apartment and now I am evicted 😢
I thought he was mister clean at first
What  are he battery dies
Battery’s don’t work like that. When electrons flow through a circuit electrons come out of the negative side through the application turning it on and back into the battery in the positive side. Just putting a light bulb onto the positive side( if it was a complete circuit) should take electrons away from from the light bulb into the battery but since this is not a full circuit it wouldn’t have worked in the first place. Also there are no “special light bulbs” that do this…
Ah yes let’s hammer a battery and leave a damaged cell in the highly flammable American made house
Cool now kids watching this will be pounding batteries into the walls
The lithium "wanna see a cool magic trick? " Internally Ignites
i dont think you should hammer batteries
No the battery wont power the light bulb because it needs a complete circuit. + & -
What about when you have to change the battery
Poor Lithium
Why would you want that on your wall to begin with?
all's swell until it corrodes
So they bringing back a toy that was used during the 90s-2000s era. I remember 😂😂
Jsjs con una pila en ee,uu se hiso un agugero aca en mi pais ni con un corta gierros la rompes a la pared 😂
glad he's stopped doing corny fake skits
That kit would have been a gold mine in the 90’s
What are these called the shaped paper that you paint over
Note the warning on the battery. You'll set your house on fire.
Okay this stuff is cool but I wouldn't want it in my house forever😭😭😭
Did we just get sponsors in shorts?
That’s not how batteries work
Thats not how batteries work at all
Wait? Your outer wall is made of paper?
Muri di cartapesta .. si bucano con una batteria
Such a terrible idea
Good anser
I like when you do at videos when you do those ridiculous long prank videos or gets annoying.
I hate you so much Justin Flom
Battery acid be like:
THE AMOUNT OF OVERSPRAY ON THAT THING IS CRAZY!!!!
Stupid
News: Fifteen found dead in a family party do to fire  Media: how?  News: …
Wye is the wall so soft
I imagine children or the mentally handicapped really enjoy these. Anyone with 2 braincells to rub together realizes this man is a moron and his "projects" are pointless wastes of time and money.
That is cap
W fire starter
Bro that airbrush hun as soon as you give it to the kid it's going on the walls the voucher there probably gonna eat it 😂😂 if I had kids there is a 100 percent chance I wouldn't get that even if it was free
Drywall ain't what it used to be nowadays.
Who is banksy
This guy makes the most useless videos on the internet period.
Bro casually ruins his nice house each video
you always need the electricity for the light to light up AND how do you control the light if it is a battery????
they’re hollywoods. the fumes in every video poison their kids and them without them even thinking about it. demonic
all he does for his videos is lower the price of each house he lives in!
Dude let you house be normal
Ok so what do you do after Halloween tho
If he sells this house to someone with all the art in it I wonder what the buyer would do
not a german wall XD
Wow that's so freaking awesome! I wish I could have ur talent ❤ is that made by you? I love Uncle FESTER AND THAT'S TRULY AMAZING ❤❤💡💡
Guys got too much wallspace.
Ok only positive and the bulb working… is magical!!!
Bros partner must hate him😂😂😂😂
I mean what if the battery just runs out of electricity
His house is a art museum
That is so dumb like that shit coulda went 💥
Wow
I live in Germany. Our walls are made of stone, not cardboard
I tip my hat to you i do just that i tip my hat to you but i haven't got a hat
Here come the helicopter experts in the comments 😂
Where can I get the stencils u use in all ur videos?
Hit the dislike for fakeness
Who else skips everything with this guys face in it? Bros fake as hell.
At the end of the year i want to see a reveal of his house
Why is he giving the thousand yard stare
Insurance won't cover your house when you burn it down lol
Have fun selling that house
Is this even safe?
Smashing a battery into a wall with a hammer is totally safe 👍
Nice work brother ❤
o
😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖🤔🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨y the heckdid u just do that
I don't know why it keep watching this guy it's all just BS
This dude really needs a new hobby instead of fucking up his house
I love the idea of it
I’m laughing my ass off.. housers in America are really low quality.  Try this in Europe. You will be hammering for years
Omg 1 🔋 and bulp 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How this battery powers?. . Okay, you just need forgot about fisycs.
Justin Flom, the Idiot of Youtube. The Houses in America are made from Mc Donalds Paper Shit
I bet his made his wifes life miserable, and made his house a laughing stock he destroyed his beautiful house with these paintings WTF id dirvoce him and brink my house back to its own glory
This is too cool. I love this guy. He’s always doing the most 💜
Someone please delete his channel
Dude making a whole glory hole
The value of his house just keeps going lower by the day
This guy have a museum Home 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How do you change the battery?
As someone with a strong ass house from the 1800s, i thought the battery was going to blow up
Diese Wände 😂😂😂 usa usa 😂😂
So when the battery dies what are you going to do
Bro just made a future explosive
Try that again with a German Wall 😁
Pore uncle fester
Does doing what you do really make you proud or accomplished at all in your life?
I hate this guy because who in the right mind would do that?!? Like seriously
Paper wall America 😂😂😂
Nope.  That's not going to work.
American walls man
Not posible in germany... bad wall qualty...
pov: an american wall
was i the only one thinking that was the rock
Bro aint going to sell the house
All this man’s videos are lies. That light turns on by a button on the light not touching one end of a battery
Adams family!!!!
Wow that looks deadly! I hope you had a nice Halloween. Greetings from Ireland 🇮🇪
If your product is so good, why are you using rattle cans?
How you going to change the battery? 😅
I feel bad of that house so many holes
Oh, I forgot u guys can just puncture you're walls without a fucking dril
And there’s the million dollar idea…. And another reason for my broke ass to be jealous of
This guy is always putting holes in the wall and spray painting the wall, and the pictures are cool and all, but if I was his wife, I’d be so mad
My name is coldish-drawl51
Ааахахх пзд в Америке дома
❤it
چند افرین❤😊
I see right through it Justin.  Soon, everyone else will too.
Something like destroying your house.That's like.In spence, of house, the piece of shi
This man is not going to be happy till they turn they house into a kid museum
I hate this guy so much
Just why
And when the battery falls on the inside of the wall
Pretty ✅️ Safe ❌️
Can  you get in uk
I thought it was dr evil
Bro stop the fake content
hey youtube, thanks for sending me all of the Halloween shit you could find in November, it's not like i was looking forward to it during Halloween or anything
🧑‍🤝‍🧑
Bro stop destroying your house 😭  Shit looks like a Fortnite lobby during an event 😭
AMERICAN WALLS ARE PAPER
Imagine they move out ….😂😂😂😂😂
In my country a battery needs 2 connections to power some things like a remote so I call the video vs and had more to been done than shown.
Why are walls in America so weak?
Wiah i had that airbrush with i skated. Always wanted to put different art on my black decks.
I thought that was Heavy at first
This guy is speed running making his house valued to zero
Home has no resale value now and what about when the battery runs out
Hi
It doesn't matter how awesome your job is, everytime you start a video with a bait, your art becomes trash
I'm American, and if i did that in my house, that battery would have exploded
Make  gordn not curs
bro, theres, theres not a wire connecting to the switch, so, um, batteries can think, huh?
What is this man gonna do when he moves out? Leave all the holes and paintings?
POV this man wants to move out
It is pretty cool  But the stencil kit?.. The airbrush gun?.. Can I use that like a regular airbrush on spray painting figurines and stuff?
You are a idiot
Beetlejuice?😂
what happens when the battery dies.
I'm like 99% sure that's not how battery's work Don't they have to create a circuit where the electricity flows through the light bulb and back into the battery or am I tweaking
How's your house still standing
The wals in america are paper
it looks like he's sucking on a pacifier
Фигня 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Is that NOSFERATU?!
Landlords hate him 😂
This is fake. The battery should be connected to the bulb from both ends to the bulbs pointy end and spiral thingy at the same time
“I’m not sure how my kids grew up to be such liars”
The over spray is wild
How do you always have room to do art in your home?
Not gonna lie he just ruined his law. If you ruin your wall, you probably have to pay a lot of money so you just hammered his battery into a wall and that will ruin it so boo-boo.
Thought the battery was gonna explode
Imagine when they move out when the new people move in and what they have to pay to get the house fixed
i know very little about electricity but i know for sure that would not work
i hate this guy forever i know when he did the first thing i realize it was also him in 2020
Штука прикольная, но какого чёрта у автора стену можно пробить батарейкой?!
I would be ASTONISHED if that battery was actually powering that lightbulb. Lightbulbs need current to function, and a battery doesn’t produce a current from one end, you need to connect both ends. Unless there’s some special thing going on here I don’t understand, this is a big load of bullshit.
That light bulb is definitely not fake
Could you do me
Yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap
What do you do when the battery dies how are you gitting it out?
Какая фигня.
Pressing a battery into the wall, works only for americans...
Стены из говна, с нашими так не получится!
Где то нас налюбили 😮
Bros house: 🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨
0.1mm wall ez destroying
Fester (gordon) from the adams family, i love that movie
That overspray triggers me so hard. Its so easy to avoid...
like anyone would or evencould use a battery to hammer a hole into a wall above two electrical sockets
Can I pet that dawg?
American walls are just disappointing
Fake!
I thought it was heavy from tf2
American walls are made of paper
Gros fake, il manque ton branchement électrique caché. C'est ce qui est le plus important de ton tutoriel ???  Ah non les américains, vous êtes trop fort, l'électricité pousse dans les murs 😂😂 😊❤❤❤ jokes ❤❤
Капитан вручения. Момент где у мегачела была лампочка вместо головы
Не то рисуешь
THE DOG OUTSIDE THE WINDOW!!!
In 5th grade science I have learned that the light bulb will not work because that is an open circuit not letting the electrical flow thank you ms.g
*In Western Australia our house walls are brick, double brick cavity external walls single brick internal walls, in USA your house walls are CARDBOARD.* 😂🎉😂
what a fuckin wall have you built?!
I thought it would be a Rock
Is that Frankinstien Mr clean and da rock
I thought it was the rock
Just imagine if the battery exploded 😂
If this was TF2 pyro, then I'd be amazed
凄い❤
Whoever buys that house when you decide to sell, it is gonna be like WTF😂
bros brain grows up in reverse
Thats not how a battery works
Sir help me
That's so cool
And the problem is what is you going to do when he sells the house he's not going to live in there forever that means he has to find a way to patch it or just keep it like that and it's going to be hard finding people to buy a house when all that stuff is still up
American house walls can't even withstand a sneezer
Solo in un muro di merda americano puoi fare un buco così 😂
Why is you house made of something weaker than paper In the UK we us bricks You guys have tornados no wonder your houses don't stand up  And no wonder you guys don't have free health care the government would be so far in dept from all the injury's and non secure houses  Robbers could cut through your house with a pair of scissors
Meanwhile, his wife is writing a novel, "My Husband and his Holes"
That was so dumb
What kind of bulb is it ? Working without a closed circuit ?
This guy is a landlords nightmare 😱. Joking but for real all i can hear is "everyone's so creative!"
This just proves how weak American walls are 💀
Why is the toy not in Iceland cause I live in Iceland? And I want a toy.🇮🇸
House cost before 500,000 ❌ Now 10,000 ✅
Yerdoyougetthan😊
Only possible in America with those fucking paper walls
Very cool
a 230v light bulb, on a 1.5v battery, where the circuit is not even closed. That will definitely work...
In real life this guy goes into extreme fits of rage and screams at his wife and family but he acts like this really nice dad online. Everything about this guy is fake
That's awesome.
its wild that you can just hammer a battery into the wall in murica XD
You dumb
I know your wife hates you
You home ic be diznile 😂😅

🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
Do your ever make videos that you're proud of after? Like I get the these corny scripted videos make the money.. But I remember watching you on the CW on wizard wars and being so impressed with how you carried yourself and how you made everything feel when you were on set. It was magical if I'm being honest.. This is just.... Brain rot... I wish you could still inspire kids like when I was younger.. Yet all I see now is ridiculously fake skits and this dumb shit.
This man is just literally destroying his own home, one day that house is just gonna randomly fall down
son: " mom i cant find a battery." mom: "look in the walls honey."
Skinny John Cena
This guy's property value is 6 ft under
Uncle fester
Damn J Flom, your killing it with the new videos, and thanks BTW I had to buy 7 of those one for each daughter 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lightbulb does not need battery bc you need positive and negative from battery
Lying bout the battery, it has to be attached to both negative and positive sides for the circuit to work
You know im surprised you still have any drywall left
Лицо была страшной, но этот набор для рисования был великолепен 😮😅
Your walls are Hella thin
Other people: I don’t understand the point   Him: it makes me money🤷‍♂️
Bro, how do you turn off the light though?😅
The dog in the back😂
How do you get battery out after it's dead
I wonder how much that houses resale values is going to be in 10 years? 😅
Take it out....TAKE IT OUT!!!
i knew it
adam family
I thought at first it was going to be  two face from Batman  Lol 😂
Is it in stores in England?
if freinds come over and call the police your cooked
Oh, I bet his wife is so happy to see that on the wall lol😂
These are stupid videos.
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
His house is just graffiti , jesus christ
Soon he will no longer have a place where nothing has been sprayed
This is so stupid
This one wasnt bad, but this dude always puts out garbage quality 'life hacks' where he destroys something totally fixable with standard repair techniques _(but often he creates the damage for the video, so its just BS all the way around)_
The dog
Can u please view your whole house
This guy is a moron. Click bait wwhore.
Painting on holes doesnt fix it
😮🎉😊🎉🎉🎉
Intelligent and beautiful thank you for the video 🎉
Why are these walls made of paper
Try this with a german wall!
Am i the only one  who thought that wws dwayne Johnson 😂
That's epic
Ok ok looks good man cool
Why you kill your house?
Oversprayed crazy
This is only possible with american walls

Not in a German house 😅
Dude I love Addams family (1991)
I can now understand how this guy made his fortune with toys and by creating those bizarre videos just for likes.
Nếu hết pin thì thay pin kiểu gì
Sdubit
I thought he was gonna make Mr. Incredible with the outline😂
Wow 😮
Valla mierda  de tabiques hacéis  jajajajaja

Awesome craft for the kids! Thanks! I’m going to get one for myself tho. Sheesh
No one is bothered by the fact that the wall is crap that can be broken through by a battery and that the battery needs both + and - to work, but here an energy-saving lamp lights up from one polarity  Нынешнее поколение все тупее и тупее (The current generation is getting dumber and dumber)
Try this in Germany and you will destroy Everything but Not the Wall 😂
Ronaldo
But.. why???
Stencil art is what people with zero artistic skill use.
Seasonal
I think he fall Science classes 😂😂
Bro me when he hammered the battery: :(   Me when he only touched one of the contacts: >:(
Poor energizer
AWESOME
What are you gonna do with the battery once it runs out? How are you gonna take it out?
Imagine your kid see this at Night your kid going to freak out of the wall
That is so scarry
I swear this guy does anything to destroy his house
This is cool, but the worst part is that you cant turn the light off and once it dies you are gonna have to replace it 💀💀💀
Your house is graffiti house  LOVE, YOUR VIDEOS❤
Justin I love, your videos ❤❤❤
Wow good
I can’t tell if this house went up or down in price from when they bought it😂
As a European guy, I legit thought the battery was gonna explode, not the wall💀
Binance Red Packet Код: BPK4MFA0YX
Is there any wall in his house that hasn't been a project yet lol
Mi piace
This is not possible in Europe. We have proper walls.
Nah i thought that it was beetlejuice for sec
I remember when Stencils use to be out when I wad like 10 or 4
Paint for the wall is the haunted mansion
What kind of crappy material are those walls made of? Also, that's not how batteries work.
That's cool, except for putting holes in the walls I'd say your pretty cool kid. 😜👍
Pathetic excuse for a wall if you can just push a battery in it
Awsome i love it to
Um Daddy? Whys the wall smoking? House collapses*

Long live creativity ... You surprise us more and more
A battery needs both ends to work. You didn't need the battery.
Cool

You should do a tour of all the different spray paints you've done throughout your house
I love your creativity!
