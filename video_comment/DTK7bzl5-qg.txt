Nemoj plakati samo pleši ❤❤❤ ✊✊✊🔥🔥🔥
Dragi Marko želim ti sve najbolje želim da u Švedskoj nastupiš tri puta kad pišem tri puta najviše želim da u pobjedničkom nastupu raspametiš publiku jer i publika je zaslužila da uživa nakon dugo vremena da se istinski vesele i naravno radi tebe želim da pobjediš ovo je tvoja velika velika iskrena priča ❤ Dragi dragi skromni čovječe dragi Marko SRETNO u Švedskoj ❤❤❤
12 points.Winner. Love you Croatia.
Nul a chier franchement. Ca gache les oreille es cette chansdon veut rien dire quelle horreur
E' solo un insieme di suoni presi da pezzi già noti...per chi conosce i vecchi successi anni 80... solo che i più giovani non se li ricordano. Voce con deficit di respirazione...Nulla di più che una canzone come tante. A parte il Rim Tim ecc. non lo metterei nemmeno in 10 posizione. La Repubblica Ceca ha un pezzo mille volte più bello. E' stato pompato non dal gradimento ma dai bookmakers.
Congratulations Marko and the team. It's not easy to perform in London. All the luck, from Zagreb, Croatia. Thank you❤
Forza Croazia 🇮🇹🥀🥀🥀🥀
his voice is interesting but sounds amateur ... NOT a WINNER unfortunatley
The best ❤winner❤
Winnerr
Winner
Croatia is the Winner! 👍
Amazing live performance. His voice and vocals are fitting for his rock song. Wish I was part of the audience at the end where he gave the public one more go with 'rim tim tagi dim'.

Marko frizura ti je bila bolja u Madridu❤...
To the crowd in Malmö: please cheer for him during the dance like these people in London and a few weeks ago in Madrid!!!
❤🇭🇷
What were they given at the end of the video?
Two personalites of one person on one stage. Marko walked up on stage and the moment music started Baby Lasagna awoke. :D Love this song!
12 points from Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤
Srećno  po stoti put,super ste.
Zagreb 2025
Obožavam ovu pjesmu i našeg Marka of prvog slušanja. Napokon imamo pjesmu i izvođača na kojeg  možemo svi biti neizmjerno ponosni. Šta god da se dogodi s lobijima ovim i onim... Hvala našem mladom Marku na svom trudu i energiji koju je uložio na naš ponos❤❤❤
Kolko kostaju krave❤❤❤
2:59 I can't with the cats. That's so adorable 😭😭
He is the best❤❤❤ 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
12 points to Croatia from Spain! ❤
Ya vimos uno con mangas grandes el año pasado…solo eran verdes… Nada original…
despite preferring the spanish song, I think this would be a worth winner.
This song has grown on me since listening more to it which I know happens when I nod my head in time along the way.  No disrespect to Let 3 but this entry is better than them who weren't my cup of tea last year then.   My favourite is is still Nemo from Switzerland but I do think this will be a tight competition with either Croatia, Switzerland, or Italy in the running to take the crown whoever has the best energy, vocals and, staging in the grand final May obviously.
I love how he leaves EVERYTHING he has on the stage in every single performance! Props to Baby Lasagna. You killed it, man!
😂
Im italian but I just hope he wins
He looks like astarion from bg3 now😂 Anyway i adore his song !
Finally a real normal man! 😁 12 points and a lot of love from Lithuania! I hope Croatia will win.
Satanska  muzika
Vielen Dank 😂 Ihr seid super,so ein schönes   lied 🎉😊
yasss!
This song has really potentional winner vibes. I can easily imagine this song as a closing winning song, crowd singing along... 😊 Good luck Marko! 😊😊😊
Most appealing of all the „fun songs“ this year!
The crowds raction after the song says enough. WINNER (no competition)
Copycat songs should be banned in ESC.
Still obsessed. He so city boy ☄️
Good song, but the riff sounds pretty much like Rammstein. The rhythm is "Du riechst so gut", the harmonies rather "Du hast"...
12 points for Croatia from Croatia. 😂😂😂 Winner.🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Meow 😻😻😻
MY ONE AND ONLY FAVOURITE ❤❤❤🇭🇷👑🇭🇷👑😻😻😻😻😻 MEOW MEOW
Not my favourite song but i hope it does well Croatia defo has earned it!!!
Love his energyyy yees⚡️🫶🏼
12 point from Brazil. 🇧🇷❤️🇭🇷
love this song bop sure qualify top 3 matriaal in the final love from the netherlands to croatia
He has already improved so so much in such a short time it is so lovely to see.
TRENDING in Croatia wow
12 points from UK 🇬🇧❤️🇭🇷
Finland back again this year !!!!!!
Meow!!!! This definitely gets 12 points from the United Kingdom.  It's Croatia's year! 😺😺😺😺
I really like the timbre of his voice 🤗
Ayyyy wa have a winner now Woooooo...  Ps love this outfit 😍😍😍
PLEASE WIN!!!! ITS YOUR MISSION!!!
I watched him on all possible mobile uploads from the audience. He sounds even better at those uploads. As for the a capella part, he was exhausted and his throath must have got dry from all the jumping. It's really hard to sing and constantly jump. Especially when singing in "metal voice", and there are at least 7 sorts of metal voice, so I don't know which one he uses, but this is actually the only way this song could and should be sang
Cheering for Baby Lasagna all the way!   Gets better every time we see him!
It’s the best song, and he’s the best performer. We are seeing a huge star in the making. And it couldn’t happen to a better person. Marko is an absolute gem.
he looks like a rooster he is awesome great song
He cant sing for sht, dont understand why everyone loving him. Its not pleasant to listen to at all. Hes making sheep-noises.
👏🎤🇭🇷🎧
Amazing
🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷😻😻😻🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
ljudi mozemo pobjedit
I love his raspy voice. Its really flattering
Winner🎉
Ladies and gentlemen, we have over 101.000 views by now 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
So, point would be, leave villages everybody... Leave and let Bill Gates and others ($$$$$$$$$$$$$$) buy every peace of land... You go there and live in 15 min city...  Yeah, it's catchy song, I think it's a winner !
Winner❤,12 points from Argentina🇦🇷
This guy is phenomenal. He's guitarist, not vocalist, but you can see that he's working  on his vocal performance and keeps getting better and better with every performance. Go Marko!
Terrible
He is so likeable. Would be nice to see him win. ❤❤❤
❤🇭🇷🏆
Love, love, love it, won on Saturday night at Boom bang a Bang in Manchester, please God this has to Win Eurovision 2024

My winner❤❤❤
The best❤
I love BABY LASAGNA❤
Winner❤
Annoying shallow agresive
Awful pants, terrible voice... so forced
Why are people complaining about his vocals, his vocals fits song.  Let's be real his vocals are better then  Kaarija's, Eleni's, Tamta's and much more. This is how song is meant to sang
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Baby? No baby on the stage. Just Holy Pope Lasagna.
Pobeda bre ❤❤ pozz od Makedonija 🎉
On Saturday, HRT cameras will record dancing in 5 Croatian cities: Zagreb, Zadar, Split, Osijek and Umag in support of Baby Lasagna at the 68th Eurovision Song Contest. Postmen, policemen, firefighters, nurses and ballerinas have already joined the invitation. In Zagreb will be danced on King Tomislav Square, in Osijek on the Pedestrian Bridge, in Split on Prokurativi, in Zadar near the "Greetings to the Sun" installation, and in Umag on Freedom Square.  Join us on April 13! A little before noon, come with your family, children, grandparents, friends or alone and experience the unique atmosphere of the Rim Tim Tagi Dim dance. 😻😻😻
He deserve to be the winner this year!
❤❤❤❤

another most vieved pre party performance
❤❤❤
Antipatik
Terrible. Bad vocals and he moves like my uncle after drinking too much 😅
His voice is insufficient
12 points frooooooooooom germaaaanyyyyyyyy
L'audio è pessimo su tutti i cantanti che si sono esibiti, il fonico è mediocre e non ha sincronizzato il labiale, un preparty abbastanza osceno dal punto di vista tecnico.
Bravo Marko do pobede.👏👏👏👏💯🇷🇸👏👏👏
I find it strange people’s obsession with the vocals (saying they are bad) It’s not a ballad it’s a rock/rap song. The vocals are going to be ‘raw’ ‘gruff’ ‘rough’ the important thing is the power of the voice which he has 👏👏👏
Winner 👏🤟😻
Mijaooo 🐱
I want France to win more than any country at Eurovision This year. But If France Dont win there are A few countries I wouldnt be upset to see win and Croatia is one of them (I also woudnt be upset to see Italy or the Netherlands but Not the Country Im from Australia. I kinda dont want us to Qualify) 🇫🇷🇦🇺
RIM TIM TAGI DIM ON TOP 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
trending in croatia! were so proud of u marko
I loved the video clip and the studio version of the song and i understand that this is not the actual performance for eurovision but i am a little disappointed by the live performance. It still in my top 5 though.
New comment from Greece 🇬🇷❤️................... Rim Dim Tim.. 🤠
SVJETSKI, A NAŠ! WORLD'S, BUT OUR! MARKO, YOUR CROATIA AND ALL EUROPE LOVE YOU! ❤❤❤❤
My winner!
Baby Lasagna🐈🥰. He's gonna win!
it's hearable and visible that he practices, his performances are even better
I'm not so much interested in what kind of performance Baby Lasagna is preparing for Malmö, I'm interested in: what the audience is preparing for him? They are incredible in that part of the song where Marko shouts: Dance with me! Both, Madrid and London, were phenomenal🫡. I'm just waiting for Amsterdam and Malmö😊
Too chaotic
I’ll say the video really doesn’t represent the energy from the audience. Everybody was singing so loudly back.
Like how different are Baby lasagna, Nemo and Angelina Mango. Eurovision wont be boring this year at all.
Firtst time my favorite song is from Croatia❤ and I am from Croatia
Bravo Marko. Samo naprijed.
He’s so sweet 🥺 12 points to Croatia from USA 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷😻
Dite drago ja te obožavam❤❤❤
🔝🔝🇭🇷 bravo Marko
Najružniji glas u povijesti glazbe, a pjesma iritantna i dosadna.
Marko ubio 🙌👌❤️
I find it strange how he pronounces ''attacks'', anyone else?
I hope he wins! And I hope he is gonna learn how to control the vocal for the performance.
Winner 🏆 Baby Lasagna 🥇
This song isn't my favourite, but he sells it good
My winner you absolutely killed it again
Our tsunami:)
Once again bad vocals. Sorry, not a winner, not a top 3 for me.
Bravo! This is the best song and performance this year! Meow to all, victory to Rim Tim Tagi Dim, go Croatia!
Meow❣️🇭🇷
Kaj se Mocartica (kosulja) opet fura? Jao.
I believe that everyone who moved away from Croatia and other countries will find themselves in this song and vote for Marko at Eurovision.  The song is just what it should be - it carries a strong message and is loud to make that message heard. ❤🇭🇷
12 points for London❤ 12 points for Baby Lasagna❤. Thanks for the hospitality, you were a fantastic audience!❤
I hope mobile phones wont be allowed at concerts anymore. Just like it was with cameras in the 90s.killing atmosphere
Winner 🏆🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛ Meow
London audience.Ha.Ha.
Has this audience been sedated by Olly Alexander?
Košulja odlična 😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😻😻😻
I am so going to explode from joy if he ends up wining Eurovision. This is the first time I'm actually rooting for my own country, love this guy so much

As a Croatian, I'm proud to say I voted for him 17 times on Dora 2024 final🐈
KING!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Winner! ❤❤❤
As a fellow cat dad, all my best to him. I really hope he wins the whole thing. It would be one of the greatest comeback stories in ESC history (He was a back up selection in the Croatian finals which is insane).
Zagreb 2025❤❤❤
I'm Croatian living in Sweden and I'm voting for Marko this year for the first time in my life ❤❤❤❤ 12 points from Sweden 🇸🇪🇭🇷
Baby Lasagne - you rule!!!! 🤩🤩🤩❤️‍🔥
I love that punk revival❤️❣️❤️
I'am very happy to see BL progress. He is more confident and comfortable with the audience. He is not jumping around that much as in Madrid and that gave him much better vocals. Go and  charm the people in Amsterdam because you are more than welcome. The stage is yours and have fun! Greetings from Croatia. 🇭🇷🤘 Meow! 🐈🏆
Obviously inspired by Kaarija... but good.
Awesome performance! You can check full musical and lyrical analysis of "Rim Tim Tagi Dim" on my channel! 💕🎵🎹
Marko nevjerojatan si, tako si drag, simpatican i pun energije! Pobjedi❤❤
A rising star 🤩
I just remembered that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozzart, in Milos Forman movie "Amadeus" liked to wear such shirts with big sleeves, and he was a musical genius. Maybe he also did not know how to sing opera, and was not exceptional vocalist, but he certainly was this "crazy" and funny, like Marko becomes when he gets on the stage 👊❤‍🔥🔥
"Fun Fact" (actually not fun at all): When he said something like faith helped him suddenly he fell from the first place in betting books. I somehow doubt it's a coincidence
Rim Tim WIN WIN❤
Genijalan momak. ! Bravo, samo naprijed do pobjede.🏆
#1 😻🕺💃
Ma bravooo❤
❤Croatia ❤Baby Lasagna ❤
croatia🖤
🇭🇷🖤
he got so much more comfortable
Koji je ovo brat 💪💪
What a mood Baby Lasagna brings to the stage...amazing. ❤ For me he is the winner, even if there is strong competition.  But if you look at the whole thing together: he wrote the song and lyrics himself, has recently become a singer, made the official video with his girlfriend and knows how to take the audience along in just 3 minutes and create a great atmosphere. 👍 For me, this is an artist who clearly deserves to win.🎉
Pozdrav iz Srbije.
This is phenomenal, but the stuck up juries will sadly bury it 😢
Meow cat,pls meow back😺.The best line ever.Go Croatia!!!❤
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Vidimo se u Zagrebu 2025 ! HRVATSKA do pobjede ! IZNAD SVIH ... HRVATSKA 🇭🇷💖 AMAZING MARKO ,AMAZING THE AUDIENCE , THIS IS WHAT ESC WINNER SHOULD LOOK AND ACT LIKE
King!!!! 🐈
The Madrid performance was much better for me. For example, the white hair is a step too far. This performance generally gives an impression that you are trying too hard and the whole thing does not have that natural carefree vibe that the national finals and the Madrid performance had.
This performance gave me the winner vibes!
Bravoooooooo
Marko privlači,komunicira ima čistu energiju,,bravo Marko❤
I prefer this to karjä
Najbolji✨✨❤️❤️🌟🌟😘😘
Beautifull
WINNER🎉🎉🎉🎉
Vrati frizuru iz Madrida i obrij brkove! A i stajling minjaj! Švicarac se oblači ka cura, ti budi muško do pobjede!

GO Marko! 🤘
Kako se dogodi da je Švicarska prije nas 😢
Dance with me London !❤❤❤✌✌✌
Marko vocals much bette but hair and the sleeves, dont make it too much, please dont. Stay yourselve.
Amazing!!
his silly little moves.🥺love how he's getting more and more confident
Marko bolja ti je ona drugačija frizura,ovo ti baš ne stoji dobro,ali o.k. ne možeš imati uvijek isti styling!Ti si meni super svakako,bravo majstore ❤
🇭🇷🔥
Before I leave I must confess  - he is a winnereeeeeeer !!!   🔥🔥🎇
What a pick me artist xD
Helouuu London! He is so hot! 👑🔥🔥
Love Marko AND will be voting for him from the USA, he absolutely deserves to win, but please, pleease, not with this styling! Hair spiked up and ditch the pirate shirt from Seinfeld, lol. Plus, he has a better figure than this, it doesn’t serve him justice. Otherwise, go Baby Lasagna, we’re all purring back! ❤
Fantastično. Sve si bolji. Super ti ide. Svaki puta kada te slušam staviš mi suzu radosnicu u uoko. Radujem se zbog tebe.  Sretno, Marko! ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏👏
Omg! He sang "my anxiety is sex" on purpose in the end! It's this year's "game over b*ch"!
it's clear: he will never be a good singer...
Käärijä, what has happened to you during this year
Sorry, no
Winner winner kitten dinner
Meow 😸
Croatie winner!!!!!! AMEZING  song!!!
The only one who woke up the sleeping audience in London. Well done Marko! ❤️❤️
This was beautiful. IT seems to me that he was a little less energetic (jumping around) that previous but vocally flawless. I don’t know which performance I Like more. And he still dances more then all other performes combined.
🎉
Nastup super ali ovu odjecu treba promjenit..❤
Sorry but indeed his voice is not consistent and the arrangement so repetetive. Top 10 but not my number one
🔥🔥🔥❤
Meow back from crowd. Better reaction isn't possible.
Drago mi je što Marko na svakom novom nastupu ima novo ''ruho''.  I publika svaki put zavibrira povratno.
Meow back from Germany ❤🎉
Lordi one with similar vocal. So anyone who says he’s flat it means nothing. He sang very well here and gets the crowd going like nobody else 🥇🥇🥇
Love it 🔥 🔥 🔥 I'm not a fan of the hairstyle though
The best Croatia. Phenomenal ❤, 12 poen❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Marko👌
marco my winnnner! you got this!!!!!my love from israel 🇮🇱 ❤ 🇭🇷❤❤❤❤
His vocals are getting better each time he performs!
Go Baby 🐈🔥🤘
Odds must put him above swiss after this performace.
Winer 12 point from  Austria
No matter the result on ESC, I'm so happy for him. To have a great response from the public and  such a growth of followers/fans is the only thing that matters for building a career.  His other songs are also very catchy, talking about issues of modern society in a ironic, funny way. Wish him all the best ❤
Rammstein - Links 1, 2, 3 ))))))))
amazing as always! he should do performance in one of his meow tshirts
12 POINTS FROM IRELAND🇮🇪 goes to cats😺🇭🇷❤️❤️🔥  Go Croatiaaaaa🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Our winner 🏆 ❤🇭🇷Nas ponos ❗️🇭🇷🏆❤️
People just love him because he is one of us, humble, normal guys, his vocals have improved so much and he is getting very confident, great performance ❤

Odličnaaaa izvedbaaa Markooooo....puno sreće na Eurosongu...voli te Hrvatskaaaa ❤❤❤
What happens with his Voice?
He's the whole package! This is it! Even if he doesn't win't, it really doesn't matter. He's the winner for so many people. ❤️ I don't like our country, because of the politics, but now I'm so happy I'm Croatian. Thank you, Marko for making a lot of us so proud. 🥰
🔥🔥🔥
Omg the bestttt❤❤❤❤ winner❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wooow, the best 👑😍
The flourish he puts on "City Boys" is up there with the iconic limp wrist on the instrumental hit in SZAs verse on Kiss Me More as something that just always makes me giggle in the best way that I do along every time.
He sounds so good. Better than in Madrid. Good job, Marko😊
🇭🇷🏆
It's simple, dear people, that's how it's done! Well done! Vocally getting better from performance to performance! We have a winner!
He is the best this year.
♥️🇭🇷🐱.....the Winner
Miaow, Cat, please miaow back!
This will totally guarantee Croatia’s best result since its Eurovision debut
In Indonesia it's very common for young people to go to the capital city or any bigger cities to find their luckiness.. this song is so related to anyone who do that for the shake of better future..
Hrvatska energija👍👍👍
Absolutely incredible live performance🔥

Is that traditional clothes for men?
This outfit or the red vest one? Now im torn 😩 don't know which one i prefer. Which one you guys think he should wear at the contest?
He seems to review quickly even with problems or not. Yes he could still win.
Genuinely he gets better every single time I see him. By the time he gets to Malmö he’ll be unstoppable
OMG, lovely outfit, I like it! Meow~
I see comments about the vocals, please! Last year Kaarija had even worse vocals,he barely was speaking in the song and he finished second,so stop
Winner ❤🇭🇷❤️😸❤️ 12 points from Ukraine 🇺🇦
Zagreb 2025
Mediocre rock song. Don't get all the hype.
I want him to win the contest but I also want Angelina Mango :/ :D
Rock star!
Fab.  Should have employed a natural compere, that was horribly awkward. Put your hair back up though Marko Will smash the televote, just not sure it'll hit the 150-200 it will need from the juries.  Fab
We are seeing Käärijä’s protégé rise up 🇭🇷! He slays so hard.
The only one who deserves to win - Croatia Winner
He sounded so good! Please please win! I can’t take another 2023 scenario, I will cry😂😂
Love the costume here - He is really rocking it.
Video and sound quality is so much better than anything I've seen from Madrid and you can really tell how great his live vocals are now. Fantastic performance, absolutely smashed it! Please please let him be the winner. 12 points from the UK ❤🇬🇧🇭🇷 😻
Zagreb 2025, I feel like a proud Croatian while listening to this but I'm from Poland
god, i LOVE seeing how much he's evolved to be on stage in just a couple performances, as well as how his vocals have evolved from that first dora performance, just brilliant. having an enthusiastic crowd is also such a big part of this song, i can't WAIT for may 🤩

This performance is so fantastic that I have tears of joy. Friends from other countries, please share the story of BL on your profiles and among your friends, be our voice, that this great boy wins the ESC 🙏🙏🙏😻😻😻🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷❤️❤️❤️
Naš ponos !!!!!❤
It's good but still not convinced that this is the winner...
Ajmo Marko 🤘🤘🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Boze Marko koliko si savrsen  Hrvatska je ponosna na tebe❤❤❤❤ Donesi nam pobjedu doma
He was singing a little bit different, more powerful the whole song, not just chorus and I think its better this way! Also outfit is great, this white shirt amazing, hopefully he will wear something similar for the Eurovision! 👌😻😻
Ajmoooo 🇭🇷 🇭🇷  ❤️🤍💙
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ winner
❤❤❤
Mamma mia, quante stonature😂
Good song , bad vocals
Hmm idk
WINNER 😻 his charisma on stage!!! Amazing!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ we MEOW back! 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷😻😻😻😻
The best! And his vocals are so good, outfit is on point😻😻 Meow back!
WINNER!  🔥🔥🔥
Fun fact: Eurovision 2024 winner Baby Lasagna was a reserve for Dora 2024.
Every time he gets better and more confident! Awesome improvement in vocals from the first appearance💯
I really love his energy, but I don't really understand the hype about the song. We've seen similar, we've seen better! Good luck Croatia!
He is saying "my anxiety is sex" insted of atacks😂
Go, go, go CROATIA! Baby Lasagna rules! Absolutely winner vibes✌️✌️ We're so proud of our Marko! Drži se i sretno!! 😘😘 Ajmoooooo HRVATSKA!!!!! ✌️✌️❤️❤️😻😻❤️❤️❤️🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️❤️❤️❤️❤️😻😻😻😻😻
His best performance so far.
Ovaj outfit mu je bolji od onoga što je imao na Dori.
So glad to see my country providing him with such a warm welcome. King <3
Well, speaking about Markos' voice, what you all think avbout Rod Stuart's voice?  Smooth, ha? Please, be clever. Go Marko, go.
Winner✨❤
vocals here are the best one yet what u on about
🇭🇷💃🏼🎶🎶🎶💕🎸😻
crowd ate once again
We love you Marko and we are very proud of you❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
zagreb 2025!!
another viral performance❤🎉
Rim tim tagi WIN! 👏🎉❤️
What a performance. I'm in a trance. So I have to say that the difference between this song and all the other songs is that it lifts my spirits, I can dance, I can sing, I can go crazy. He is the only one like this this year. A real pleasure. Other songs are boring to me as soon as I don't need to listen to them again and put them on repeat. I put this one on non-stop, it's addictive, and it's always the only one on repeat. So that's the top. Too bad you didn't sing I'AM INSTAGRAM BOY. I'm waiting, waiting... Oh o o o I'm an Instagram guy🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻... Cool!!! The top of the tops!!!. I just loveee this song!!! 🐈😻❤️🧑‍💻🧑‍💻😘🐈😻❤️🧑‍💻🧑‍💻😘😘😘😘💯💯🔥🔥💥🐈🐈
I guess he can sing whatever he wants! I just love him as a person and he really deserves an amazing result! Go Marko and Croatia ❤
Thank you London ❤❤❤❤
Absolutely delicious❤ MEEEOOOWWW! Go, Marko, you're our winner forever!❤🔥🇭🇷
I love this song 🔥🔥🔥🔥 thank you Marko ❤❤❤
🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩
Meow🐱😻❤️🔥🌟
Amazing performance ❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🇭🇷 Well done, Marko!!!! 12 points for sure 🔥

Well, our country boy finally came to London and became a city boy. Nice shirt,very clever,👍👍
My winner 🏆 Baby Lasagna 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷❤❤❤
whole Poland will be meowing for Baby Lasagna. The way crowd is responding to him shows that he should be this year winner. Love Marko, he's amazing.
Another good performance. Thank you all for showing so much love to our beloved Marko. 🇭🇷

wow, what energy, it would wake up the dead
Such as amazing guy and that personality 👌👌👍👍👍Croatia proud with you❤️❤️🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷thank you on this happinies what you bring in our life
Before I leave, I must confess, I need my sleeves to DECOMPRESS.
Such an amazing journey of a very interesting performer... Just remember that Dora performance which already promised a lot, but then came Madrid and now London... His confident on the stage is insane! In a very tough Eurovision year with many great performes and great songs Baby Lasagna stands out as the most charismatic one. He's so likeable and approachable and very raw while performing and people really dig it. I don't know if he'll win or not, but I do know he already done a lot for his country. Good luck, Marko!
This is terrible LOL. I felt second-hand embarrassment watching this. Cringe song, cringe lyrics, cringe performance... It's laughable
Meow❤🔥
Ovaj autfit je odlican :) Kosulja predobra.
Fantastic performance, Marko! Great stuff. I can't wait to see his performance in Malmö. ❤
Go, Marko, go!  What a FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥and CHARISMA✨✨✨✨✨  You are the KING! ❤️💪💪💪💪❤️

You're beautiful in every sense both as a person and as a singer. We are proud that you represent Croatia. Good luck to all other performers. Big meow😺🥳🇭🇷
Croatian metamodernism. He's not being ironic - he really does love his cat! :-)
Croatian king🇭🇷🇭🇷❤️❤️
Simply the best
Bravoooo Baby Lasagna , bravo Marko, kralju naš. Osvojio si svijet 😻😻😻😻❤️❤️❤️🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
He is improving more and more for each day! That combo with big sleeves is the best so far. Meow cat please meow back! 🐈❤️🇭🇷
not my favorite tbh but i prefer this rather than ukraine
No please, this is not the styling for eurovision. Get rid of it please.
Impossible to win...
Overrated and boring
Outstanding performance!! Super Marko , you are the winner . We are proud of you , the whole of Croatia 😸❤❤❤❤
The vocals are terrible. For the win the performer must have great vocal, great stage presence and good performance. I like Croatian entry but live is simply no go for me.

Winner🎉
killing it 😻🇭🇷
Do you think he could've imagined, when his song was one of the reserve options for Dora 2024, that a few months later he'd be hearing his song sung back at him by huge crowds in Madrid and London? Life comes at you fast, and I hope he's enjoying the ride, no matter how he does in Malmö. Best wishes from NYC!
I LOVE IT!! ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🇭🇷
Please, WIN!
I think this will win because of him and Croatia first time to win and the story of his journey to the final.
Congratulations  GO Marko GO 😻
King!!!!! 🇭🇷🇭🇷👍 Ajmooooo Marko, pozdrav iz Rijeke!! ❤️
