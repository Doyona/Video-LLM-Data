Australia has one of the most complete white ball squad currently. Look at their depth, Ellis or Johnson can easily walks into any white ball team currently. They've the best wrist spinner in their team and giant all-rounders like Marsh, Maxwell, Stoinis.

Team Australia ✅ Individual Aussie ❌
Best ever match in cricket history 😂
Sears is so unlucky
Ye Santan Aussies Once again in form near WCs. 😢😢😂
I will bet you this T 20 is in hands of india

It won't be a surprise if Australia becomes T20 champions again this year
Chapman is one of the most overrated player. I don't know what selectors see in him 😂
Australia dominating in every format 🔥 big chance of winning this t20 wc 😢
I think NZ is doing misfield becuase they recently played with PAK..they got that disease from them
Is this really new Zealand? By the standard of fielding it doesn't seem so😂
They are strong in every format🙂.. Look at the t20 side very dangerous..  Ps:they're heading for another icc title😅
Home team 3 0 loss such a shame for nz the need to learn how to beat aussies
As usual  like india ,nz surrendered to Australia. Shameful
It's the first time I saw New Zealand fielding like that..what awful 😖 😱
Itani kharab fielding black caps ki team se kabhi bhi nahi dekhi ye tisra t20 match hai har match me kam se kam 2 se 3 catch chode hai

Role of any Cricket board is just to Identify his player and give them proper format to perform and which is thoroughly done by Australian Cricket Board 🇦🇺 👌. See BCCI, Our team going to play WC just after IPL like 2021 T20WC.
for the life of me, i can't understand what's wrong with New Zealand !!!
New Zealand 🇳🇿 needs to practice taking catches properly again for 500 years more and then come back and play cricket again
One thing that  makes Australia the strongest team is that they don't let themselves in pressure, they just plays their natural game. They look really strong to win T20 world cup 🙄
Well played Australia.
Well played Australia.
Glenn Phillips superb form 👍👍
The most overrated and overhyped character of Indian Cricket Sachin Tendulkar needs to learn Cricket and batting properly from his Almighty Lord Travis Head
Cricket is temporary, Sarvesh’s comment is permanent
Josh Clarkson good bowling
New Zealand 🇳🇿 is a very very small baby in Cricket infront of there Almighty lord and boss Australia 🇦🇺
Bazball is the biggest hype created by the English media.

In Bilateral series Australia always outclass New Zealand.......
Aus have some luck every match,but they played very well.
Again maxi thrown his wicket😢
❤❤❤❤
Where is jack fraser Macgurk? Why Steve Smith is playing , I don't understand
The boundary is too small. International cricket should have specific rules for boundary size.
Newzealand all round game is so pathetic, poor fielding and batting sums up to 3-0 loss
NZ took expert fielding practice sessions with Pakis before match perhaps 😂😂
It's definitely Aus 💪💪vs rest of world in this WC.
Bachon ind ko do aane fir ausies ki faadi jaayegi.tumhara baap aane wala hai be ready
Aussies dominating in each format, WTC and World Cup wining at 2023 and now aiming for t20wc 2024!
Really i missed the 2nd coolest captain Cane Williamson
Travis head is most undeserving player his play only depends on luck no skills
Lund team nz
Indian team is getting ready for ipl..This year they can take break from this to get ready for the wc as a team But NO..Australia is on the track as always before wc..paisa sab kuch nhi hota...
Mark Chapman is now becoming the burden on his team! He's consistent in his poor performance and not performing even as per his own standards! Keeping around 100 strike rate in back to back T20 matches with low scores doesn't justify at all!
Nz is biggest chokers
Where is Kane mam?
West Indies India Australia  3 in 1 2024 winner t20
Main players upto last and still coudnt win..... Shame on NZ.... Too poor cticket in front of aus

Trent boult getting smashed on a bowling pitch also.  Only good enough for IPL level now imo.
Sure Australia will win the T20 World Cup
not enough crowd today
Like I said before, Trent boult is not good enough for international cricket anymore.   Too mediocre and too old now.   I think he should play only IPL level cricket now and make easy money.
each and every Australian player is a match winner
Dhawan should comeback in indian team
Nz had to try hard not to win this match 😂
Australia is coming to get this t20 world cup again❤️
India jetega world cup like karo
Sold out crowd in WPL match last night in India    Empty stadium in AUS vs NZ today.  This sums up the state of cricket.   Only Indians are watching it bcz they are free and have nothing else to watch 😂😂

Smith is not a t20 product👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
i don't think smith is the opener for AUS in coming t20WC but why they are making him a forced opener....Matt short or Josh inglis would be a better pair up with head for the opening slots for the upcoming T20WC
I request ICC to please give the upcoming T20 🏆 to Australia🙏
Australia will be win this T20 WC 2024. Congratulations in Advance Aussie ❤
13:04 what is that sound 😂
Nice scripted match
No matter how much the Indians abuse australia in social media, Australia was, is and will always be the real kings in cricket🔥🔥🔥
Kiwis should stop playing Cricket in Eden Park , such a small ground for International Cricket.
Very bad fielding by Nz

T20 World Cup 2024 will be play between IND vs AUS

3-0🔥🔥🔥
Why every rule in cricket is against New Zealand 😂😂?
Steven Smith please back in t20 format 😥😥😥
I am hundred and ten percent sure,  Steve smith will not score a single fifty👎👎👎👎👎 in upcoming test series. Since 2023 his average in test is just 36 .Steve smith is totally finished👎👎👎👎 in all formats .
new zeland good team
Lose against West Indies
I would say it again. Head is a very ordinary kind of batsman, unfortunately for india, he had his best day of his life in finals.  In hindi we say " Hr kutte ka din aata hai" Aur final wahi din tha Head chutye k liye
perfect timing? 6:10
No doubt Newzealand is a good team but Australia is Australia 🔥
Bharat ke samne ande
Spencer johnson should be in the aus squad for the world cup
New Zealand is totally a dustbin team😂 Apne hi home ground par 3-0...vo bhi wc se pehle😂😂
Australia ❤❤❤❤
Aus mata ki :...... Jai
New Zealand will never win against Australia, its a fate 😂😅😂, nobody change it.
Aus is born to defeat india
New Zealand poor fielding 😢
What a boundary 😂

Austailia ke aage koi tik sakta hai kya 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's cheating because aus got 6 overs powerplay but nz got only 2 overs😅
Kya kr rhi h nz yr...maar na bc
MSD fans👍
Why NZ team  is very  inconsistent like WI & SL🥺🥹
Lockie Ferguson why not playing today?
Seens like soon aus becomes last all three format worldcup championship😢😢
COME ON AUSSIE! ❤
Smith is not a player of 50 overs and he is playing  in 20. Spin side is also very poor due to high averages they could get wickets. Starc is also in question. If they want to win wc then they will have to think over it.
Ish sodhi is out of form for a long time. They need their big players  to come back. In t20 world cup NZ will be a much better team.
India vs Australia 2024 T20 wc final but india lift the T20 wc 2024 after 17 years party start in the dressing room and rinku singh finishes of in style
Weakest NZ team ever
Team RCB😊👇
