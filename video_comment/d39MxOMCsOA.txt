9:56 dream of karem
How many ducking ads are there on this video my fuck
0:06 The Monkeys Are So EVIL
It’s noglog
StAArzzz lmao
More Lego party!!!
17:00
ketamine doesn’t help you wake up 😢🤣🤣🥲
That's a bingo! Inglorious Basterds reference.
1:52 "Our Yellow Star" for Vanoss is crazy 💀
Cool video
19:57 it’s actually more funny with Nogales than with Brian
every mario party like game, wildcat is always the one that gets fucked in the ass
Brian is the king of space uber
Some one animate Tyler screaming about the monkey's, please, i beg.
CANDY CASTLE 🍬🍭🍫
Wildcat being selected randomly 4 times in a row was a 1.24% probability.
Lego has more content than new Pokémon 😂
Anyone else getting the Tom Holland Lego ad
18:24
10:03
You guys were LITERALLY part of my childhood (my later half but it still counts) and my first introduction to Gmod when I watched your compilations and I’m glad you’re still continuing content
I can't watch the video when im getting a Lego ad every 2 minutes, this is kinda unwatchable
🤍🤍🤍🤍
33:17 bro sounds like he's legit getting mauled by monkeys 😭😭😭
Monkey dont like pigs it seams.
Can you play this without Nigla
16:25 Song name anybody?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please play the ninjago map next
17:41. Best father lol 😂😂😂
wow, 4 times wildcat got monkeyed
Fun fact: I learned off the grapevine that Mr Gold is a real minifig out there, and one of the rarest/most expensive in existence.
I❤LOGO
Id love to see more video likes ts its funny
🐒👊🏻🐽
Damn the monkeys grape intro
33:13 Wildcat getting piled on by LEGO monkeys.
16:40
23:35 OFC they are jumping one person 😂
Poor Wildcat. While everyone else was having fun, he was on Planet of the Apes.
funny part is that I watched this on a different account and there was a good 7 lego adds with Tom Holland.
*LEGO guy voice* HEY!
23:25 26:18
0:18 yes it would Wildcat. Yes it would.
Seems that drawing isn’t vannoss’s fine suit
I was once 7 now 19 watching your videos
Three ads by the 4 min mark is insane
These adds are insane
I luaghed so hard during this video. Vanoss' dry humor is perfect for these games. "Rough day at work".
ever ad I got was that fucking tom holland ad
12:34 oh this minigame is kinda hard to do on keyboard
At a certain point I'm thinking even if Wildcat choose random the monkeys will somehow still drop on him rofl 😂🤣
There's no way Wildcat got that unlucky wtf 😂
Monkey attack lmaoo🙊🙉 0:07
8:20   Heh, they're in their +30's😝😝😝
Wildcat got jumped by the monkeys for saying the n-word 😅 lmao
anyone else getting like a billion lego adds
34:56 he didn’t even pick random XD
Anyone else get a bunch of ads in the begging of the vid ? I got like 4 in 10 mins 😅
Reparations for Fortnite views
PLEASE play a Jackbox game!!
24:13 Evan's habit of never correcting his vehicle mid-air in GTA comes back to bite him... I knew it would one day lol
Can we bring back the gmod death runs?
S
Get panda and pasta in this game.
This was an amazing video I got a good laugh out of shits so funny😂
37:06 Vanoss comeback 😎😎😎
Need to see more of this
BUDU BUDU BANANA BOAT 🗣️🔥 22:50
Tom Holland did not age good
Yooo when is the next q n a dude oh and love you broskieeee ❤❤😊
Vanoss crew and sidemen collab plz
Every mid roll on this video for me is the Tom Holland Lego ad
LMAO!!! This video was incredible dude. 35:27 killed me and 28:42 had me rolling
Not picking Ninjago is a crime
That last one wasn’t random gng
finally another video thats worth watching again..  please drop pasta
Still doesn't fit in my head how people can't take a break to eat especially while recording.. I don't get it
Someone said they “left Brian’s stream for this,” I’d leave Brains stream for a Raid Shadow legends ad
i hope vanoss crew knows ninjago
I was bricked
10:47 bro he fucked up my headphones 😭😭😭 the right speaker is all muffled now.
I miss lui
1:37 he’s so humble
The monkeys attacking Wildcat was the funniest thing
Grown ass men playing this
Vanoss!!! You and the crew should play Mage Arena 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
u need to play battlefield 6
35:27 *YES!*
Respect to wildcat for laughing off the loss.👍
Wildcat really refund these game after that?
Can you play this without Brain
All monkey clips 23:25 wildcat 26:11 wildcat again 26:56 wildcat a third time 31:58 of course it's him again 33:01 I think we all know where this is going 34:47 at least it wasn't tyler again
My favourite part was when Tyler got gangbanged by monkeys like 5 times
23:30 The Bad Touch by Bloodhound Gang would suit that moment the best.
Absolute chaos 36:25
1:37 but it would not be the most stressful thing that would happen in the lego game
23:41 ayoooooooooooo?????????????????????
At 16:48 and the exact same 10-15 second unskippable Lego ad has played 7 times. Not even halfway through the video... wtf youtube
33:29 there's no way😂😂😂
Vanoss's character should have been a yeti wearing the rice hat
Wildcat getting unlucky 5 times in a row is ludicrous
The Donuts and Dragons minigame with Wildcat mocking Terroriser got me 🤣
i miss the old subtitles
I’ve always wanted Mario Party to be remastered but I’ll take this 😂
17:50 33 years old btw🤣🤣
“Ooo that’s a bingo” goated reference by Brine
Oh my god, Lego games? Awesome!
magical
36:30 Ahahahahahaa
Sorry but way to many ads for freaking LEGO of course. But every 5 to 7 minutes or less is absurd
"What's up my ninjas" - Terroriser 2k25
9:30 😂😂😂
XD "whats up my ninjagos?" fucking killed me as a long time Ninjago fan!
Please mr Vanoss play outlast for spooky October
22:51 the nostalgia lmao
Brian break dancing into "what up my ninjas" sent me 😂😂
"A CANDY CASTLE"
Wildcat really fucking with "steal stars" 💀
Я видел знак божественных сил
1:00 oh no, not Daithi De Tree again…
Wildcat getting bullied by the monkeys was hilarious
23:33 bro I fucking love this moment specifically. Just the way Tyler says it.
Yo this is more fun to watch than Mario Party lol
Play pack man party
No pasta yayyyyyy
24:12 KNOWLEDGE
This game was made for someone to say, “I’m bricked up.”
The Cristopher waltz reference at 2:30
24:08 - Trials Evolution returns
nothing like watching Wildcat being jumped by monkeys
Anyone else realized he hit 26mil 😮
The monkey's rob Tyler clean🤣
0:01 rice hat
did you make a joke about the big kirk yet
Rich mfker wanting to refund a 20$ game on steam is crazy.
w
I want wildcat to get hit by 100M  monkey that want you to play another lego party game. I really want wildcat to get hit by 100M monkeys.
This is better than Mario Party
Brian’s Tarantino reference at 2:20 😂
27:00 funny part is it's not even fully random, it shows the color in slow motion of who!
1//81 chance for wildcat to get screwed that hard.
shoutout brian. I know unc needs it
Bros really happy this is his job lmao
If you play this again, can you  play the Ninjago zone? This video was hilarious.
18:54😭
2:14 fall guys right before getting blasted by a cannon
I got a Lego ad before this video
2:16  “oooohhhhhhh that’s a bingo”
yall should do pummel party again!!!!
What the heck is going on I think the monkeys are targeting Tyler. What are the odds of that?😂 23:33 26:23 27:11 32:14 33:18  At least it’s not Tyler this time. 35:06
11:12 6 7 is so tuff
lego collection reveal?
who else just wanted to watch Wildcat getting screwed over but from a different prospective? xD
I haven't laughed this hard at one of your videos in so long 😂😂😂
This is so much better than the mario party games bro lmao
It's crazy that Vanoss has made a BIG comeback in a Lego Party game!
THAT'S A BINGO!!! -Hans Landa (Inglorious Basterds)
Alternate Title: Mario Party, Revenge of the Monkeys
The unskippable Lego ad every minute and a half really adds to the video
No sound on you edit evenn😂
Funny ass video play this game more!!!!
Love how everyones thumbnail is just wildcat getting ganged up on by monkeys😂
If the vanoss crew learns about the ninjago lore, my life would be complete
lego add every 2 mins gotta love this bs
Those monkeys showed up so much I figured Vanoss would stick Lui in the description.
ello
Yo Evan's comeback was crazy though
Loved the video! Please do more LEGO Party!!
No one got the Inglorious Basterds reference 😞
I was waiting for them to say banana boat bandits
Sorry brine I got more interesting things to watch
Tyler’s goof ass Irish accent itches my brain so perfectly 😂
monkey wape
4:16 Tyler and Brian just tryharding
*bro causally uploading this at midnight*
24:43 R.I.P controller
Haven’t laughed that hard in a while good one guys!
No pasta???? Hell yes.
23:25 26:20 27:08 32:10 33:10 Enjoy everyone
I miss Brock
Oh yeah, make more of these videos this was hilarious
This fucking hilarious I love hope to play this with friends
33:23 XD
The monkey scenes need some randomness animation 😂😂😂
the what up my ninjas got me crying right now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like how Tyler just gets progressively more Irish each session
Can you play this with out Brian
"that's how you you negOtiate" 😂
16:24 The music cutting too made it better XD
Easily an S-Tier video. PLEASE play more of this! 🙏
28:41 "NO S**T DAVID"
Anyone notice he didn’t choose random when stealing Nola’s brick
please play more of this i love this
24:43 I heard the control Spike😅
yo vanoss got a new mic
Orbital Monkeys inbound is the funniest thing I have heard all day
We are so back aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging aging
I need more of this!
As a LEGO fan, I might get this game.
MORE LEGO PARTY, MORE LEGO ! I am from 1995 btw
10:46 How did his mic do that? I thought that was a character in the game saying that.
WILDCAT getting attacked by the monkeys was hilarious. Got me belly laughing 🤣
You guys need to play Dokapon kingdom, it’s a totally fun and great game for the family! (No suffering included)
at least wildcat got the top of the description
Pulling this footage out anytime someone says white privilege exist jkjkjk 😂 Tyler got f’d
10:06 would a penguin give a good WHAT?!?
This video should have a million views by now
1:10 He wants you to touch his tree trunks again
19:26 Brian played that Lunar Lander flash game and it shows
NO ONE SHOW NINTENDO LAWYERS THIS VIDEO, THEYLL THINK THEY OWN COLOR TURN BASED GAMES WITH RANDOM MODIFIERS AND 1-10 SPIN SYSTEMS
35:25 YESSSS!!!!! 👹 😂😂
Just letting you know, there's a dude out there doing pullups til he laughs at one of your videos out there. In case u wanna add to your extras channel 😂
A rough day for the gang today
Finally a watchable video
A CANDY CASTLE!
Can we get a petition to get rid of pasta and Brian?
4:12 What is the music the gets added here?
Can't wait for (redacted) party title rename!
Nintendo getting their lawyers on standby.
The dumb LEGO podium screen is the best gaming installation ever.
10:45 loud.mp4 16:10 quiet.mp4
Nintendo keeps whining that people are copying their games but maybe it they let other consoles play them then they wouldn't get copied. I prefer this game over Mario party.
Trust ketamine is horse tricholizer, it does not wake you up that much
Never prayed for Brian’s demise more than during this video
Unleash the monkeys! 🙈🙉🙊🐵🐒
11:11 67
Honestly? I'd be proud to tell someone I play video games with my friends for a living. XD  Also poor Wildcat, the luck was NOT on his side today, damn Irish....I say being part Irish meself, What? We're built different. XD
15:48 It's pretty obvious
67
23:30 26:22 27:11 32:10 33:17 35:03 Monkeys attack!🐒🐒
Id love to see more of this XD
Got a Lego ad for a Lego video coincidence I think not
This wildcat is like game of life wildcat
This video was amazing.
Finally a video without that B pasta ruining it
For all the time wildcat said the n word
10:47 21:49
35:27 That "YES!!!!" 😂 mah gawd my earphones were at max dude.
give us more lego party mr vanoss
im surprised nintento didn't patent the entire party concept
4 ads within the first 7 minutes is wild
As soon as those fourth monkeys came in after Wildcat I about pissed myself  Edit: IT HAPPENED AGAIN NO WAY IM CRYING
Big CORP teasing Nintendo
8:26 average NTR video
So they throw you MONKEYS that STEAL from you  What did the developers mean by that? 🤔
What game is this
34:57 vanoss didnt do random XD
This video is a fever dream
should have picked Ninjago
THE MONKEYS😢
2:20 inglorious bastards reference
35:26 That was probably the most deep  and passionate "Yes" I heard from him
no thats not a goat 11:01
Man, the monkeys choosing tyler every time was soo funny, please play this game more!
yeyaaaa
Honestly. I liked this more than the Mario party videos
how the monkeys actually work: your desires whether they are secret or known decide who is *ahem* "hugged" by the monkeys...😂
the most touching and jaw dropping comeback ever in the history of gaming
Big surprise the Irish are good at kid's games 😂
LEGO Party is literally a ripoff to Mario Party 😂
Seems very good. Hope they add other Maps in the future, but honestly i doubt it
0:47 I was going to say that vanoss is back with his dead rising 3 character
The Lego Star Wars games are my all time favourites but this might take the cake 😂
Let's hope Babytube doesn't touch this video!
Maybe the randomness of the monkeys is that they pick a random player at the start of the game and they always go to that player
Vanoss lost every single minigame btw
All the things I like about this video is the monkeys!
Yayyy no Pasta. Finally
Someone left Brian's stream for this
Lets go Legos
Pin me !!!!!
27:15 Mr President, a 3rd batch of monkeys have hit Wildcat
0:07 literally just started watching this video 😂😂😂
Best videos to watch while in bed
13:00 I'm dying 😂😂😂
16:41 destroyed me. Few things have made me giggle as much as that
Biggest plot twist
The Vanoss crew playing These games are AMAZING 😂😂
ily
12:08 12:49 13:29
Anyone noticed a crap tons of more adds? It won't go away and its like every 30s to 50s
Tyler definitely hates Marcel now 😔
what did wildcat do to make the monkeys so mad at him????
2:17 Love the Bastards reference
21:11 lmao, they cucked Wildcat so hard he could’ve gotten the gold brick at the top because it was a free gold brick. You didn’t have to pay for that one 😂.
Pig with helmet vs MONKE. Not something I expected to see at 5am.
I wonder if this could be used as evidence to make the game devs investigate how the fuck they coded "random"
Around 4:10 can anyone tell me please the name of the song in the background!!! Cuz I hear it every where but don’t know the name!!!
•
Incredible game 😂
Now isn’t this ironic? I’m constantly getting nothing but Lego ads whenever I watch a Vanoss video nowadays
play megabonk ngl wanna see you and lui play it
Yeah vanoss eating in the mic is a deal breaker for me
ooo you guys should play rabbids party i think you’ll like it
Wildcats sins get their revenge lol
W video
It is The game of Life 2 all over again
Compliation of Wildcat getting screwed over by those damn monkeys: 23:32 26:21 27:08 32:10 33:13
Evean what is this shi-
6:06 "im in fookin Ireland, brine's in the fookin....all da way ovah theah"
brian’s “thats a bingo “ reference went over there heads 😂
MORE LEGO PARTY
No THEME PARK not TEAM PARK
37:57 is the cherry on top for this video loool
This video was an echo chamber lol. I need another video of this game.
they definitely got paid to play this 😂😂
watching wildcat being gangbang by monkeys was really fun
Got Tom Hollands Lego ad before this video
Please play more!
Grown ass adults btw 😂
Brian you're gay as fuck!
tung tung tung sahur
there ain't no party like a lego party
no pasta w
Lego Mario party vanossgaming video is never som i thought id see
Watch Nintendo patent this system 😂
21:48 edit killed me 😂😂
PLEASE BRING BACK DUDE IM NOT SCARED
No *pizza pasta time* :(
another vanoss lucky moment
16:12 The silence was so loud😭
im happy because theirs a nother party game and its lego what is more funny because of the monkys just taking over wildfcats life
bro! The comeback from vanoss is insane!! 😂😂
this right here is a certified hood classic. Calling it now
Do all the boards
Vanoss in 2025 still trending on yt 🔥😊
There's so many monkeys on wildcat 😂
2:32 they remembered monocle gentlesir!
02:52 fart jokes will always be hilarious 😂
I got 5 Lego adds in the first 7 minutes of the video. Ruined the entire video because I had to see Spider-Man ride a Lego dragon every 2 minutes. Big dislike on this video.
I got a lego ad to watch this lego video
Everytime
Tyler be like ''im going to jump of a bridge in lego City''
I like the part when Wildcat got attacked by monkeys.
10:22 the endless suffering begins
Wildcat gets fucked by almost every party game dude 😭
breaking news: wild feline gets  gang banged by group of monkeys
the funny thing about the monky bombardment is that the first and last pull weren't even random
wsg guys LOLLL
16:45 had me fucking crying😂😂😂😂😂😂
I swear vanoss would not be nearly as successful without royalty free music
28:51 Gecko Moria laugh
Crazy that wildcat has such a nice ass that those monkeys honed in on him
Lego ninjago remided me I'm old for 20, plus legends of chima lego tried doing but it didn't take off.
YOOOO!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wildcat getting attacked by the monkeys almost every time 😂 you literally can’t make this up
Day 84 asking Mr. Vanoss to play pressure in Roblox with Lui and his other friends
So much better than Mario party 56
Alright men, and bag. Are you guys ready for the greatest journey of your entire lives? You guys ready for the ride of a life time? In 3, 2, 1, LETS DO THIS  16:08  Well this game f*cking sucks
17:12 YOU NOT QUEÆN GOWWOZE!! ,YOU NOT QUEÆN GOWWOZE 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Them voicing a Lego animation series would be insanely funny 😂
Never thought I'd hear beakjobs in a Lego Party video from Vanoss.
Keep calm and keep her going 🦉
Good! No pasta
31:20 he didn’t censor that 💀😂😂
16:43 guys i think Brine is killing it.
37:50 Well there is one monkey right there
22:50 best part
Im pretty sure there was a 1/81 chance for the monkeys to fawkd him  Also another game for the Vanossgaming resume
37:22 Luigi moment
1:01 Mr Tree Trunk Returns! He’s back.
Wildcat and party games is the funniest combo ever.
Bro it’s October! WHERE IS DUDE IM NOT SCARED
It's like Mario Party but with Legos!
Seeing Wildcat getting f!@#$%d by monkeys EVERY TIME is the funniest thing I've ever seen😂😂😂😂😂😂
the fact wildcat got chosen for all the random moments🤣
reupload?
Omg hear me out what if you guys play trials fusion as a group
The chances of him answering are very slim, but are you okay, Vanoss? Asking because of the outro music
_=_=_
can't wait for pasta to join here
16:18 the pure silence took me out
wow lui is in lego party
21:08 So basically Norm Macdonald…(Not Really)
Nah Brian is a genuine loser
Nintendo attempted to rip off Lego once and this is Lego's get back
9:24 the beginning of wildcats downfall 😭😭
Play this again please 😂
Who's been here long enough to remember the original Daithi Tree bit? The gmod one
🐵🙈🙉🙊🐵
Does anyone know what song this is at 24:09 if so please tell me
1:13 I guess that’s OK, he’s not wearing blue pants.😑
Hey! It’s me in that menu selection there!😬
16:13 8 y/o me making my legos fight
I honestly hope they make this a series like game of life and Mario party, it’s really entertaining watching Tyler suffer in every party game
Chaos sumo with pasta when???
8:45 all over 30 BTW
27:58 not true, i heard kristen did too
One of the funniest videos
53kst
Saw delirious play this i knew vanoss was next
Wildcat and Party Games just don’t seem to mix Edit  Mario Party Game of Life  Lego Party
Neat
Those monkeys did not grant mercy to wildcat at all during this session 😂😂😂😂😂
Lego was porkin the pig of content!😭
I was on Brian’s instagram live before I came to this video 😂
This was great, hope they play more of this!
The best part when the monkeys said "It's monkey time" and then they monkied all over Wildcat. 😂😂😂
Im Ngl, iv been watching vanoss and his crew for yearsssssss now, and I still cant tell whos who sometimes when Wildcat and Terrorizer are talking 😂
Like how vanoss hired lui to steal from wildcat
Nintendo gonna sh*t a brick
i think you guys should play boardgame-online
28:42 damn, busted out the government name lmao
Bruh, Vanoss is keeping the Luigi wins by doing nothing legacy.
Why'd 5 little rats dislike this masterpiece?!?
35:25 "YAESS 👹"
My people are being represented
Is this reeblox? The game for retards?  Or in some cases pedophiles
Sovereignty liberation and non interference create your own realm that's impentrable
1:16 make like a tree and leaf
3:18 what is the song name?

Finally this is what I've been waiting for saw everyone uploaded but had to wait for the goat to upload it
Day 147 of asking Vanoss if he can play Yu-Gi-Oh! Master duel with lui for a video idea 💡
Liking before baby YouTube takes this down 😂😂

Netflix n Chill ❌ Drill n Chill ✅

Play the bo3 zombies George Floyd mod 🙏🏽
Lui calling back up on Wildcat RIP
9:28 some things never changes like wildcat’s horrible luck in party games
10:47 nuff said
Lego: Because we're so expensive nowadays, we don't give a crap about kids anymore to even sell bricks
Finally, I can play a Mario Party game without having to touch a Nintendo product.
This game hates Wildcat😂😂

This is how I find out they made a Lego version of Mario Party
Those monkeys really wanted some porkchops.
Everyone with their personalized characters, and Vanoss is over here with the most generic looking person lmao
too early
This one was definitely not on the 2025 bingo card 😂
Vanoss is always better iwl 😂😂
I hope these guys play some more of this game.
Intro Diabolical 😂
Would be a Mario part like game if wildcat doesn’t get fucked over
Congratulations on the baby Wildcat

Game of Life=Wildcat ending up Poor, Lonely, and Wii Todd Dead  Lego Party= Wildcat ending up screwed over by Monkeys  What is it Wildcat and Party games don’t mix well? 😂
