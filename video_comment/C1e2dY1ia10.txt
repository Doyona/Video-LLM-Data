I've played this song uncountable times but I'm still yearning for more. Good work Double D. It's a worthy song for our fallen Hero❤❤❤
Still painful 😢😢😢
Alafu utaskia GenZ alikuwa bado mamake ako toddler when Raila was in Prison for fighting for democracy akisema ati "He betrayed us" Raila owes you NOTHING!! if you felt betrayed it's time for your Father to also fight for democracy vile you won't feel betrayed. Let Our BABA REST IN PEACE 🕊Jowiiiii!
Luo nation will mourn you for 50yrs to come no leader we shall have like you Baba.Our hearts are filled with sadness.

Raila never died his death
Erokamano Jadhot for such a great tribute to Jakom
From the handkerchief that never leaves my hands. That's really sad statement. Aseywak maol
Curtain fell River dried  Things fell apart  The lion came back home so calmy & unable to Wave as his normal norm.  It was never easy nor, Business as usual, Acceptance wasn't reality   Weeping was the order of the day Emotions were high & high  Just like RAO001 high on air Emotionation L,R & C  It was written & if not, It was written  That a day will be dayed in our memories. We will live to live the memory             We cannot live as long as we want, For we will die even if we don't have. @samirdewilliamx
Waiting to review in 2060😢
How did you compose this song...am moved always aki...❤
I dont understand this language but i leave it here...our children 2080 who will  be here and see this Just know this man was a hero and it was the shock we ever received the whole world😢😢

I knew there is death, I knew and I still know I'd die, but I never imagined RAILA ODINGA dying!! nooo ....a great man, the who lived for the worthless, the one who defended the defenceless...the one who stood for what is right even if he was left alone ...our own hero is gone ...no more ..he suffered, but stood everyday to fight for us....how do we even start living and watching news without you on your ideas of development....REST EASY ENIGMA!! REST EASY BABA!!...REST WELL WUOD ONEYA ...AGWAMBOOO....TINGA...MASIRAAAA...ININD MABERR

Regardless of how you are going to make a master class tribute song. All are meaningless at this moment, in your music there is no single release for Baba. Initially a true musician from Luoland had a song of Baba in their album like of Emma Jalamo, hana mbwembwe kama nyinyi.  Go well Jakom I'm very emotional and may I also die at 80, be buried with 72hrs as you instructed.

A Message for You in 2050: Remembering Raila Amolo Odinga  Dear My Son Travis El-Roi & beloved Daughter Katrina Terry,  As you read this in the year 2050, I want you to know about a man who shaped Kenya’s story Raila Amolo Odinga. He was more than a politician. He was a symbol of resilience, courage, and hope. For decades, Raila stood for democracy, justice, and the voice of the people often paying a heavy price for it. He was detained, criticized, and misunderstood, yet he never stopped believing in Kenya’s future. Raila’s dream was simple but powerful: “A Kenya where every child, no matter their name or tribe, can rise to their full potential.” He inspired millions  not because he was perfect, but because he never gave up. His story teaches us that leadership is not about power, but service. That truth and sacrifice outlive every election, every title, and every season. {I know I have always told you about the great man He was but still I want you to always remember} As you live in your time a future he dreamed of remember the lessons his life carried: √Stand up for what is right, even when it costs you. √Love your country, not for what it gives you, but for what you can build for others. √Forgive, but never forget the importance of justice. √Keep hope alive, even when the road is long. By the time you read this, Kenya will have changed but may you still find in our nation the spirit of Raila: the courage to speak truth, the strength to rebuild, and the heart to unite. With love and faith in your generation, You Beloved Mother & Friend Ms. Anthony  Written in 2025
Wangni to obiro mopogore adier litna gadier nindgi kwe ratego 😭😭😭😭 may the heavens receive you with open arms good bye Baba
