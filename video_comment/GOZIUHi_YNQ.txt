While wearing Crocks.  Haha
Whatta muppet
Carry on but please take the wrapper off the crocs don't need the extra plastic
And he's wearing a full length steamer suit kenidiot
What's the drama? has his anti croc suit on😅
Darwinism at its finest
Let him be, we need some thinning of the herd!! 😂
What an idiot
Haha,,,, old mate raving the guy on the knee board while he is on a stand up board. Hilarious
Some people are..farrk
I'm rooting for the croc. 🐊
It's not just the crocs you have to worry about
Councils put those signs out to manage risks like this. The signs aren't out to stop you from enjoying yourself; they are there so that when you try to sue for your own stupidity, you can't say you weren't warned.
When did we let natural selection take its course. They were just trying to warn him and he’s fighting with them.
Two words… Natural selection
"Have some common sense" Dude, this is literally how Nature manufactures common sense, let him swim
At this point these fools need to let natural selection take its course. These idiots make normal peoples lifes harder.
These are boomers still crying cuz their parents made them do chores.
got to respect a mans desire to dice with death. No need to swear at the bloke
I wish people would stop interrupting Darwin while he’s working🏴‍☠️
Darwin award
This is how natural selection works. Nature takes care of those too dumb to understand the signs...
He’s probably from Florida and doesn’t care about crocs.
Crocs deserve feeding. They love the taste of idiots ..
Just let natural selection run its course
Hope the croc enjoyed his cocky lunch!
Bro said where’s the sign I’d be getting out the moment he said croc
croc's need to eat, too
At least the dingo didn't need his baby.
He's on a board, not in the water. He's sweet as.
German?
always a white knight trying to be a hero
Its natural selection at its best.
i love australians :)
But protection from stinger suit 😂
Old mate said were are the signs 🪧 😂
Darwin award winner
Wow
It’s called natural selection….its a good thing…only problem is he’s old so he’s probably already procreated 😖
Some people have to learn the hard way!!
Well.. the guy was already blue when the croc got him, so.....
Why do these short videos always end before the best bit?
Part 2 please
Yeah I didn’t even dip my big toe in fresh or saltwater in Queensland unless I was at least 100 miles out to sea. Nope nope nope!
Sounds like very specific regional sense but not common
Where’s the signs?😂😂😂😂Dude please
Not the good ole CrockBlock
Should have filmed the attack.
Saw a video of a party on a lake! Loads of people swimming then the camera pans round and there’s a big crocodile trap 30nyards away!
Great camera work.
Gronk
Idiot
He’s just fresh Crock bait on that board padding with his arms 😂
Your lucky he doesnt like his meat blue
A Darwin Award coming …..if they can confirm with a abode part 😜
What a goon. Let the crocs av him
I hope he got eaten 😂
He says whilst wearing crocs. No wonder he was confused. Gotta love Australia
Natural selection
Insane guy
LET... NATURE... TAKE.. IT'S... COURSE!! We don't need these dummies around, mucking everything up for the rest of us.
ACHTUNG! In BIG writing on big YELLOW signs with pictures of crocs or jagged lines like teeth… At legit EVERY water spot that looks nice to swim and even ones that don’t look inviting, every single open water place has a sign, multiple signs!! That man is looking like a snack in a croc’s home!
Natural selection
We just need to let natural selection do its thing.
Yeah mate.. he just saved  the your life mate
Croc is like I'm not touching that   It's sick
Your all safe mate...crocs don't eat Smurfs
Hilarious that he's wearing a stinger suit to protect from the box jellyfish but not concerned about a croc taking him for a death roll and home for lunch.
throw some meat over there 😂😂😂😂
Crocodile tears
I was at the Accident and Emergency last week in Darwin. There was a crocodile waiting for treatment, that had a man stuck in its throat !
Let him go I would not have said a thing he obviously wants to be croc bait
Village idiot
Let the pomm have his fun
Bob Katter would tell him
Natural Selection
What an old fool he will soon be croc bait
I've never been to Australia but when an Aussie tells you not to do it and they know their area and waters don't do it something might eat you and Australia has a lot of dangerous animals. Beautiful but dangerous
Why is this guy hand-paddling on a charcuterie plate?  Just let Darwin do his thing.
The next day he goes surfing again carrying a bucket of fish and fried chicken to use as "decoys".
New movie. Just like American Werewolf in London it can be American Know it All Liberal in Queensland
yeah righto....
My first day surfing in OZ there were TWO hammerhead sharks no more than 20-30 feet away. And that undertow.....
croc here: the paddle man is right leave him alone.
I will never understand why tourists come to Australia and want to ignore every sign or local that tells you the water is full of crocs. We have so many croc and the big salt water crocs that don't play. Crocs are not like alligator you can't pat one or have one as a pet.
Cairns local here. Crocs are attracted by noise and vibrations so yeah, as soon as he started with the back chat, I'd stop talking and start smacking the surface of the water to help him win his Darwin award faster.
Why point the phone downwards when the public wanna watch the idiot in the water
How fitting it is that some people earn the Darwin award in Darwin, Australia.   This was technically in cairns but whatever
Fortunately, the man in the blue suit survived. The croc swam up to him and said, "Am i a joke to you?"
Some America: *Gets mauled by giant crocodile*  Aussie: Something wrong, yank?  America: It's pretty big.... I guess 😒
Why is anyone doing anything in the water of Australia? I dont do anything that Could possibly lead to a dinosaur eating me alive.
Let natural selection run its course, we'll all be better off for it
Throw a brick at the F wit
What a drongo
You guys need to mind your business and help the human race
It’s called Natural selection mate
Let natural selection do its job.
He ticked YES for the “jump ahead of the queue” outdoor VAD option. Much quicker, slightly messier.
Did a hear a white South African accent on the guy in the water ?
You dont understand what youre doing fool
Darwin award in the making😂
When the woman voice started..he was hoping for a croc ..that guy hates his life..but hates women more
I’m mean always listen to the locals😂
CROCKBLOCKING😂 that’s Hilarious. But JESUS please don’t let that guy get ate by a Crocodile 🐊 Horrible way to exit this planet.
Let natural selection do its job mate
Video of said croc eating him??
Just let him go. Who are we to intervene with natural selection 😂
Let him go! The crocs are helping the sane people by eating the idiots.
Sad part is, they'd probably hunt down the croc because of this idiotic person who made a conscious choice. I'm grateful to the bystanders for even trying.
This dude just casually bobbing around and splashing water like croc bait.
Shut up will you!? We need MORE natural selection not less.😂😂
You'll be sorry
How do people travel without doing some research beforehand especially with the Internet the way it is
Darwinism this is why there’s more thickos about 😂😂😂😂
When it comes to idiocy, Ol' Chuck D lays down some painful lessons. Hopefully this morsel didn't leave offspring behind.
Reminds me of that phrase genetics will take care of itself.
darwins law
WHERE’S THE SIGN?! Baby nature ain’t always got signs you gotta have some buy in too!
Go ahead mate lol 😅😅😅
I wouldn't waste my time on know alls 😂😂😂😂
"I'm fully aware of it"...
Thi guy is a evolutionary dead end  😂😂😂
Why are Australians so annoying When it comes to crocodiles? I'm from florida, and i too have been compelled to impress tourists with my superior herpetological knowledge 😂 but in the end nobody cares, just let him be one less goober at the boat ramp to worry about. Crocks gotta eat too
Bringing a new meaning to FISH FOOD😂
yeah righto
Your in nirth Queensland mate😂like hes an explorer who's lost his way from Antarctica ❤
Darwin never sleeps, have the day you deserve Sir!
Natural selection.
You know the man is upset when he puts down the camera.   Also, a woman needed to say something to prove the man correct. Gold.
Thats gotta be Bishy 😂😅😂
Many reasons not to go to Australia
This one speaks for the seas!
He won't be paddling with his hands when they become stumps
Some people are absolutely morons
Removing his dna line i.e. extinction from humanity
Grab a chair and watch it all unfold.
The idiot sounds like a Brit. Obviously thinks he's still in Blighty. Please let him be, the UK has too many of these tossers so any that end up as croc snacks is a bonus!
Silly man you'll think hes knows common sense
Let him get eaten 😂
Is he a traitor to humanity for attempting to save a Karren ? Sometimes it's better to let nature run its course, nature knows what it's doing.
Sounds like Tony Johnson
Whelp, at least you guys tried. What an idiot
To be honest what he is wearing is a cultural shock to crocs they wont harm him 😂
He just wanted to feed the crocodiles - such a kind gent…😮
"Well sir, there are no signs, therefore i could sue a crock for eating me.. so...i say ill take my chances."
Faarrk moiii…. Don’t let Uncle Bob Katter see this video.
This is a situation where I wouldn’t care about being yelled at - I’d head straight back to the wharf. Crocs don’t care about your ego.
Who else was disappointed when a crocodile didnt appear ? 😢
Common sense isn’t so common these days !😅
Survival of the fittest.
He’s from Florida and Floridian don’t care for crocs we have gators, caymans, American crocodiles and so much more . That’s a Florida man if I ever seen one. 😂
Don't  stop a fool while he is trying for a Darwin Award
Best course of action is one warning, lure crock over, then ready the camera.
“Come down to papa” “you’re not papa you are crocodile” “come down to mamma”
At least you tried👊✌️
He's busting save your life rhymes, that's a f***ing crocodile recently seen sign :D
Did he die?
i say we just take away all warnings and signs and just let nature take its course
If a man’s telling you to get out of the water to save your life, it’s a personal attack, but if a woman does he listens? Dude has zero survival instincts
It’s a wonder he’s survived this long in life doing crazy things like this!
Its my right to be in the ocean...
When an Australian 🇦🇺 tells you some advice about a dangerous situation in the outdoors y’all betta heed they warning or y’all Finna get hurt
A good fella trying to save someone's life. The other guy could have said thank you and moved swiftly.
Brain drain hit Australia bad
Croc 12 metres saying " leave him my guy , i got this".
Love the accent.
Maybe hes suicidal, but judging from his scifi suit hes more afraid of sunburn and cold water than a giant reptile ripoing him up and storing him underwater so he gets all rotted and tasty.
Mate! Natural selection, that idiot doesn’t need to be breeding and the crocs are hungry. SHHHHHHH
I love mental old blokes!
Dont think he'll be whingeing about it if a croc gets him.
I hate Crockblockers !!!
Darwin's theory of Natural selection is NOT a Theory
Good way to get rid of Greenies
Rage bate 🤮🤮🤮
Temporary Australian 😂😂 anybody seen dave 😂
You can’t educate f..kwits, just let him get eaten.
male karen
It’s called natural selection! That blue wet suit surely looks tasty to a saltie!
Waste of Darwinism, enjoy your traffic
Meh just let natural selection happen at this point
where's the sign ... ffs
Crazy first-world countries. They don’t worry about how to get their next meal because they have so much, and they don’t care anymore about common sense— even feeding themselves to dangerous animals that won’t hesitate to take a bite out of them.
What a fucken idiot
Idiot!
Darwin Award contestant
They have crocodile recently seen sighs on Fraser Island how far south till u dip your toes mate 😂 head up to Darwin and and preach to the surf crew like that and they'd probably drag you into the water and drown you themselves.
He wants to see the ones captured at Hartley Croc farm just up the road from cairns and then you might think twice they got some beasts
Eat the cu@t 😂🥺😂
That man giving the warning is a better human than I am, kudos to him.  I'm not going to argue with someone to save their life, I'd give that idiot one warning then throw my hands up and say, "okay, you're on your own fella."
Shut up and keep recording!
Croc - what a crocblocker
Idiot would rather be right than alive
When Australians such this bloke saying 'yh your in north Queensland mate!' listen? Because not only is it infestation with CROCS, but normal crocs, and salties, now salties if you don't know are really fast!
You’re going to make a video at least point your phone at the subject..
Just let the reverse darwinism clean up the gene pool.
He's not going to live long . what an idiot
Some folks can't be helped...
I remember playing a round of golf at the public course in Cairns way back in the 80's not long after immigrating from Canada  and was walking toward the mangroves to retrieve my errant tee shot when I heard a crusty voice yell out "where the fu>k do you think you're going mate?'
Let Darwin sort it out.
If an Aussie brings something to your attention, you better start running
What an eeejit
Don’t yell at the man for doing what he loves. If he’s willing to assume the risk of swimming in croc infested waters let him die by that decision.
Where's the sign!? As if theres no sign theres no danger!
I would most definitely listen! The comment; "don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"! 😂
There is one born every minute.
Man idiots like this is why an animal gets blame. Like the dude daid  do what you wanna do, just dont blame the croc when he get done for
Natural selection I reckon mate
When an Australian yells at you for safety reasons, listen!
I travelled round Australia for a year when i was younger, I really miss the blunt as fu"* Aussie attitude to literally everyone.
If this dude thought for a moment they didnt know where he was hes out of his mind, im sure there is about 10 just under him. Its incredible he didnt get got as soon as he got in the water.
I love the instantly defensive nature of a pillock.
If there are no locals in the water it’s usually smart to take it as a sign.
Typical arrogant pom
True, the hero didn't have to film it.
Some people dont like being told and know better. Stubborn
Let him be... we don't need this type of DNA in humanity.... Totally FKN brainless🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Common sense ain't that common 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's natural selection in action. Fish must be fish. Retards must be retards. Just take the footage for the news.
no you have to thank people like Steve Irwin for showing people that there nothing to worry about when it comes to crocodile
Inconsiderate uneducated people make the mistake of cleaning their catch when they get back to the boat ramp. When people do this repeatedly, the crocs get used to finding food around boat ramps so guess where they're going to hang around.
every time I see this. Get out of the water!!!!!!!!!
If an Aussie is telling me what I am doing is dangerous, I would immediately stop, because very few things are considered dangerous to Australians.
Love the fact he's covered from head to toe to protect himself from the Sun, but is unable to comprehend basic warning signs.
Well said...
Nobody should marry this bloke. What a dumb guy. Id be paddling so hard if i was told abt the crocs back to safety
People are regularly getting attacked and eaten by sharks on suburban beaches all over Australia. There have been several this year.  Unless you’re going to get on your soap box and start telling everyone to keep out of the water around the country so you can post it on TikTok then leave this guy do his thing Kevin.
He knows what hes doing
Leave the guy alone ffs. His choice.
What a div
There’s always one 😮
Look at the blue onesie. lol. let the crocs eat.
That's like talking to a man calling himself a woman
CROCKBLOCKER
Don't be a croc block let nature take it's course.
I would never swim in a river anywhere north of Bundaberg... Ive seen way to many hungry crocs
Big ones Mackay haha . Pioneer river and when the dam opens they come straight out into the ocean for a feed
I dunno. That guy’s dressed like he knows better……
Crocs thinking "Let him win a Darwin Award" 😂
Good riddance
What is that silly looking boat/board
I think the sign was saying beware of man wearing Crocs
I bet he smiles at a crocodile and is taken by their friendly grin.
Croc's got to eat too.
Maybe he is on a efoil?
Karen
cairns 😂
Idiot
Did he win the Darwin award?
And the Darwin award goes to...
Natural Selection. That is all.
Great filming  of the concrete.
Why is he dressed like a Smurf?
...and then what happened?
Funny how he was "fully aware of it" but then wanted to know "where's the signs" 😂
Is old mate seriously wearing crocks
haha, his message is, do what you want mate but when your in the afterlife, don't blame the crocodile, cause yah know, hes doing his thing too
Let the idiot become dinner one less FW on this planet
Here for the follow up. Did smurfette live?
Typical 65 year old dude. Dumb as mud, thinks he’s still in charge.
They want to die, let them
If anyone has any real stories of being stalked by a saltie go ahead and share them below. Whether you are a local or were a tourist visiting I’d love to hear your stories. 🐊
If an Aussie says don’t do it, it’s really in your best interest NOT to do it.
Abby update on this?
What is Poppa Smurf doin' surfing on an esky lid in Nth Queensland?
okay putting the crocodile thing aside for a second, what is he doing? what is he wearing?
If an Australian ever tells me to get out the water im getting out that mother flugging water quick smart you aint gotta tell me twice🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
Leave the bloke alone ffs.
Leave him be
ive seen a 10 ft one less that 6 feet from the shore. crazy. imagine literally being torn to pieces.....
fkn tourists. sell their dead parents sydney properties and act like rich idiots in qld.
Darwin award time
I'm from across the ditch, never been to Cairns....yet, but even I know that. Deathwish waiting to come true💀
Why would they be lying about it?!
Come on now mate don't cheat the crocs out of their easy lunch !!
Let him go ,natural selection 🤷
If the croc doesnt get you the sharks or box jellyfish will.
You’re in North Queensland, mate. Have some common sense! If a native tells you that, you better listen!😂
😂😂😂
Senile nomad ???!!!
They need signs for poisonous ants as well.
Not much makes us Aussies panic so if one is panicking for your safety, I would think that's a great time to take notice and probably listen.
Temporary Australian
Yeah righto 😂😂😂
We have lots of them here in brazil
The issue is that if papa smurf here gets chewed up then the coppers might have to chase the croc down, which is extremely unfair to the croc.
He may well be OK with meeting his creator.
I hear your frustration and I agree with you but these days, let the tool find out the hard way
Love how it’s someone elses fault… the council didn’t put a sign up, so if I get eaten then it’s not my fault cause there wasn’t a sign!  Yeah cause the crocs only hang out where the signs are 😂 keep paddling mate maybe you’ll get out far enough to see a shark sign in the middle of the ocean 😂
Arguing with the bloke trying to save your life?
That is one dumb entitled and moronic human.
I love how he is flapping about, like a dying animal!!!
Crocs and sharks?! No thanks
Dumb  ways to die lol
Natural selection, idiots don't deserve to be warned if they can't read signs.  What does he think, since he's not from there the crocs won't attack him??
Probably a Victorian labour voter, best left to be eaten.
Let Charles Darwin do his work
Bro Croc gatekeeping
Bruh.  This is nature thinning the herd.
Eat him please i wanna see
Let me guess… he’s American
Unreal
Friend arrived at hotel in the dark and took his fiancé and flashlights down to the beach. When they turned them on all these eyes reflected 100ft away in the ocean. Clerk freaked out bc previous day someone got dragged into the ocean
Il bet he's a jew
Well maybe the crocs don't like men in blue?
I can only assume that when an aussie local is giving you advice on dangerous wildlife, you do as he's frikkin telling you
Casper tryin to become a ghost
Crock blocking. 😅😂😅...hilarious
Foilers
Unfortunately common sense ain’t so common nowadays
You’re in North Queensland mate. That’s enough. 🐊 😋
Crock blocker
Oooooh lunch !
I just would've said "Boi them Crodilli's gone get chou"!!!
Natural selection! 🙄
Good riddance
"go ahead mate, I can't wait to tell this story on the news tonight"
A crocodile downvoted this
I feel sorry for the croc that’ll try chewing through that suit, it’d be like having to get through tough plastic wrapping on a small snack of cheese… not worth it!
I wouldn’t be swimming anywhere where in Northern Territory or anywhere in Queensland everrrr and saltys are my favourite animals on the entire planet
I can’t help but think of Jimmy Carr and his bit on people and signs 😂
Is that a foreigner.. trying to tell a local... that there are no crocodiles in the area⁉ Un-fkg-real
Leave him alone. He knows the risk if he gets eaten its on him.
Where is the video  of him being eaten by the crock . . .
This video would be better if a croc was chasing him.
Let him get eaten
Ah he looks old. Let's just call it population control? 😂
Natural selection. Crocodiles need to eat too.
He needs a sign to tell him where crocs are?  Common sense isn't very common. Its Northern Australia mate its croc country
Stupidity has no bounds
Dumb and tasty, the head of the crock menu😂
As soon as he said "leave me to do my thing" l would've said "a good day to you Sir" & gone about my day.
Man, let the crocodile have a meal. Leave him be
Onya Kevin
Natural selection keep your beak out
Love how his embarrassment turns to anger towards the people trying to help him
Is it wrong to hope there is a 2nd video?
Nigel Butler the famous body surfer
Let the dumb people die , the world will be a better place.
Where’s the sign is the wrong answer! The CROCODILE will eat you not the sign
Is that a efoil
Nek minute, " Our father who art in heaven look after this new soul". Crocodile "blessed this food we about to receive"
Natural selection time
Sorta bloke to have the audacity to scream for help
Signs or not - the water is their home! 🐊  Same as the sharks! 🦈
I met a conservation ranger who was attacked and had his arm de gloved by a ‘salty’ in northern Queensland. The Aussie croc watched him for days. Same time every day he would stand on a rocky outcrop over the sea to fish. One day he stood at his usual spot to fish but almost immediately a huge croc had come out the tree line behind him where it must have been waiting and came up and along the rocky outcrop to attack the ranger. It had planned its ‘hunt’ and lay in wait like a human or big cat in Africa!!
Aussie tells you it's mad - Stop.
I’m just loving the fact he’s wearing crocs
He's exactly where he should be 👍🏽
Dude is lookin to collect on his Life Insurance policy....
Anybody know what happened to that guy did he get out of the water what happened?
Shoulda stopped when he gave attitude so we can increase the average IQ.
let the dinosaur have his meal
Let him get eaten.
Lefty vibes
Let him be a smart guy, we’ll see if Darwin agrees.
Applicant for a Darwin Award.
As a tourist, i spotted a croc across a river in Northern Queensland from a boat ramp. I was only halfway down it and still well away from the water. He ducked under the water on the other side of the bank so i walked back to the top only to turn around and to see what I believe was the same croc close to the bottom of the ramp where I was. 100% he would of had me if i was senseless enough to go down to the bottom.
Yrah, righto 😂😂
I love that he's even dressed like an idiot
Natural Selection 😜
Is this bloke still alive ? 😂
Unbelievable 😮
Natural selection at work
If that smooth brain wants to argue against common sense and common knowledge... Just let him go.  Some people are wise. Some people are otherwise. Just don't look back when you hear the screaming. It will be all kinds of gross. Darwin candidate.
Natural selection don't interfere mate.
Unfortunately, for the crocodile, it went hungry.
Yippee!! I'll go on a jolly with man eating dinosaurs 😂
Australia is a great country to be killed by a wide range of deadly critters… just saying 😎😵‍💫
Darwin award.
Id the dude would be rude id fkn left him for natural selection get my camera out and make a profitable vid out of him.
Let him go for a paddle. Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution still applies.
The irony of this being in Darwin!! 😅
Who cares! Let him learn the hard way!!! 😂😂😂😂😊
Where's part 2 🐊  smashing him
Things are not the same since they cancelled the Blue Man Group.
Crazy Man 😮
When you are telling someone something for their own safety,and they are arguing with you about it. There are times when you should just walk away. This seems like one of those times
The Croc comes up and munches the guy yelling from the boat ramp while the smurf just paddles off 😂
Southerner! 😂 theyre so DUMB
Says a man who could easily get eaten on his stand-up paddleboard
Must be an Californian
" youre in north queensland have some common sense" 😂😂😂😂😂
The crocs be like "if the man wants to swim, let him swim" 😂
happens more than it should... just like the idiots who want to swim when lifesavers say the beach is closed because of a shark sighting or bad rips.
Is that Bob Katter trying to be croc snacks?
I need to know what happens next
When an Australian Lad is wearing crocs.. you listen to him.. he's earned them..
When he headed out he had a full board and legs
What an ungrateful old tw@t
this was funny
Darwin award runner-up? Or crocks are also.using uber eats??
I'm not from Australia but I would assume there would be something in the water whether it be a croc, shark or jelly-stingers and act accordingly don't need any sign for that, too bad they didn't continue filming and let nature take it's course (main course 😂)
Listen to the local Aussie every time…!
LoL  dum people
This is life now I CAN DO & SAY WHAT I LIKE even if your stopping me from dying RIGHT O.
Apparently he has no common sense
Loved Australia. Loved the Australian people who warned me about everything poisonous, venomous, deadly or close to it, water/land, everything. Albertan here… like trying to warn tourists not to approach wild bison, bears or elk. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Probably an American.
Let him go it’ll make a  better video than this for our entertainment
Shouldn’t need a sign regardless…
A nomination for the Darwin award. And possibly the winner!🎉
Darwin Award incoming.
What an idiot still arguing. 😮😮
Boomers man
Its dumb tourist like this who ruin tourism for people who do the right thing when they can tour australia
Wearing crocs while talking about crocs. Crikies.
good to see its not just the USA that has people like that.
Crocs:"always the fridge protecting the snacks"
Let natural selection do its thing mate. Crocs been around for 100s of millions of years, they arent goign anywhere !
Bit harsh, cant you see that blokes already feeling a little blue?
You lived in Australia for decades FCS! his brain is wired for Europe
You can't cure stupidity 😂😂😂
Unbelievable, a guy tells you there is 1 crocodile in the water that would be enough for me, This guy looking for signs😂
It's like trying to tell your kids to get out of the water when there's been a shark sighting
THE PADDLER HAS THE BRAINS OF "A VEGIMITE SANDWICH"!
typical overseas tourist - all the best to the croc getting an easy meal
I haven't seen any! Well they certainly see you😂
The daintree is full of crocks . I never stepped foot in certain areas
Sir, why you interrupt Nature selection. Fu...n idiot will reproduce more idiots. We already have them more then enough.
Let nature take its course mate
If that man wants to get eaten by crocodile, let him get eaten by crocodile. Just have your phone ready to record it
Always listen to the locals! About food and definitely about dangers.
Dumb as a house brick!
_Tourist Season_ has begun early!
Crocs, sea snakes, jellyfish, take your pick mate. LOL
Is ok he’s old probably dying,
Registered liberal
Let him be one with the nature. No common sense.
Don't worry about it mate. It's just natural selection. Let the c*nt do his thing....😂
Did he die? PLEASE TELL ME
Absolute idiot 😂😂😂
Idiot😅
😂 we need to avdertise the “come to Australia” song again 😂 it was one of our best. And like he said “we won’t stop you, but don’t blame the croc” you just won’t see any of us swimming or paddling on a dinner tray out there lol. Literally can see you have no visibility, but crocs….they can see alllllllllllll
Who cares, let the idiot be.
Aussies are so much more comfortable calling eachother out in this way, many cultures could learn
From 8 seconds onwards if you look really careful you can actually see a pair of Crocs!
I got stalked by a croc in Darwin! Every evening I’d walk down to the harbour to sit next to the water to watch the sunset with a whisky. One day a local walked over to me and said, I’ve seen you here the last few nights. It’s not a good idea to make a habit of being in the same spot night after night. The crocs learn the patterns of animals they stalk. “He’s watching you” and the local pointed out a nearby croc just below the surface.  I took his advice!
Let em go mate, gene pool needs some chlorine anyway.
Its like in Uk when a refugee tells u where the jobcentre is!! You best believe him!!!
Wow
Australians are my favorite people 😂❤
Another tasty morsel for the local Saltwater Crocodile population, he can only get eaten once.
Like how completely clueless tourists are in the glades of Florida
Why is he dressed like a smurf gimp?
So, do we get to see the blue guy eaten in part 2?
Look at what he's dressed in, enough said, fed to the crocodiles for sure
I ain't spending any time on it because in the meantime, every three months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in north Queensland
Here on Cape cod we have great whites. Lots of em. I don't surf anymore. Read the sign.
Hihihi....don t blame the crock if you get done by....hihihi....the save jump siecle
Oh let him get eaten. Improve the gene pool
There's a numpty in every town mate 😂
Here in Florida people paddle board with alligators all the time there's literally a bridge called alligator bridge and there's visibly like 20 alligators on Shore and God knows how many in the lake if people constantly paddle board go up to Shore or get out in the Alligators or right next to them. Is that not something you'll do there in Australia?
Crocblocking 😂 jesus christ thats hilarious
As a species, how have we survived this long?
Crock probably been following him hours before this guy found him
Go ahead mate go do what you wanna do☠️
Survival of the fittest
muppett
His the type of guy when he gets attacked he will claim no one told him there were crocs around
Well it's his decision.let him be eaten
I say we just remove all the warning labels.
Prime example of ego in action 😢
Croc blocked
Does anyone else hear a distant tick tock sound?
Just leave him to it and when he is screaming for help just shout I told you so. You can't teach thick
He’s got the survival instincts of a kamikaze pilot.  😂
Natural selection!!
Why are people like this allowed outside 🤣
It's like people coming down to South Florida walking their dogs around the water. A native will warn them that there's Gators and Crocs, but do they listen? 😂
And the Darwin award goes to🎉😂
Where’s the follow up video with the empty board floating 😮
I honestly wouldnt be upset watching that fool get eaten on video. He wanted it.
Let him argue his point with the crocodile
Bro I live in florida we deal with dumb people all the time
Don't blame the crocodile.
I'm a glaswegian but when he shouted your in north queensland mate..even I knew it was crocs😂
Yike …. My biggest fear is dad long legged spiders. And the Americans.🇨🇦
Thick as fck
How the Gene Pool gets emptied😂
Should’ve let him win the Darwin award
Since he says he's fully aware of it, then he doesn't he wouldn't panic or get afraid when the worse case scenario happens. In fact, He wouldn't even fight back since he's fully aware of how vulnerable he is in water 🤡
Crocodile here: please don’t interfere with wildlife
At least he doesn't have to worry about sharks
YA north queen's len,  now that white meat or dark meat, those SALTIES and FRESHIES have favor you know
common sense, BE A MATE HAVE ANOTHER FOSTERS, the loco like there meat marinated in the hot sun. OH YOU BE NICE AND TENDER
Croc’s like “didn’t you hear the guy?? Go do your thing! He’s happy on the banana leaf, which I happen to find quite tasty as well! Please leave us alone!”
Man, if a local in Austria tells me there are crocodiles there I'll believe them, who am I to argue?
Hehe old mate needs a sign.
Bro just let him feed the crocs
Let him do his thing 😂
You just wasted a potwntial vural content opportunity.
"Where's the sign?" Signs don't stop dumb people doing dumb stuff.
why ratting on the crocks ?? crocks live's matters too !!
Let him get eaten, it's called natural selection. This'll b a great vid 2 play at his funeral.
Natural selection
Pls tell me he got mauled 🙏
What that guy is even trying to do in first place 😂
"Mate he wants to be a statistic! Let him be the one " - crocodile under the boat ramp 🤣
I put money on it he’s a liberal
Not the fridge trying to protect the snacks from the crocs  😭🙏
Let nature unfold as intended
Never mind the croc danger, why is he dressed as a Smurf?
Kook
No bullsharks ?
I love the attitude people get when they have had an idea cooking in the head to the point they believe it's good enough to try out only to be immediately called out by everyone watching has gotta be devastating to the ego but it's far less devastating then the wildlife will be.
Some people just can't be told, dropped on there heads as children
I say let nature take its course. Crocs help remove certain types of people. They are doing us a service and favor by doing so.
Heres an important tip on safely assessing whether water is a croc hazard in north Queensland/NT: Feel the water, If it's wet, it's got Crocs. Jokes... don't feel it. You'll get nabbed. Look at it from a safe distance. If it looks like water,  it's got Crocs.
Listen to the locals they know best 😮
Croc may do world a solid leave him
Darwin theory let it happen
Saw three tourits paddleboarding on the barron river two years ago 😂
sometimes......just watch, yknow?
I have a blue house with a blue window.
When the locals are telling you no, DONT.
Natural selection.
Sometimes, don’t you just wish that a croc would come and tip him off that thing!  The panic would be exquisite. 😊
You want to be crock lunch, go for it. Lol!
Darwinism being slowed down
I like how the main motivation for the cameraman warning him seems to be his concern for what will happen to the crocodile if he gets attacked by one
What an idiot. Been to Cairns and Quensland, I'm from Ireland. I don't swim unless my brother who lives there tells me it's generally OK. Note generally.
most normal queenslander imo. the cameraman and the lady were the crazy ones.
The stupidity of some people knows no bounds.
Queensland is Florida.  Florida is Queensland.
You see too many crocs here too .... on peoples feet - disgusting
Aussies we are so chill... if a local tells ya there's danger.. you listen
I wouldn’t stop filming him …
Even if there is no sign. It doesn't mean there's no crocs
Well, just left him alone with the croc... Let they have him mate😂😂😂
Some people deserve crocs
LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE😏😏😏
Let the numpty get eaten
You tried let him be bait
What does he think is happening - they are lying to trick him or something?
Leave him to it. its called natural selection
Typical crocblockers!
Dressed like Dory let him be, he's just wants them well fed 😂
This dude seriously wants to be a crocks happy meal
Yeah mate a paddle board won't protect you from a dinosaur 😅
Must be a trump supporter
So true; the crocs will do what's in their nature to do, which is to eat you. Listen to the locals- they know more than you do. It's not their fault if you don't come back from holidays.
If an Australian tells you to "have some common sense."...you are in a dangerous situation. 😂
When someone with that accent is talking calm and straightforward with you, it’s pretty legit. That’s a cautionary tone from both of them. Submarine/amphibious predators are no joke.
Lucky guy 😮
He's wearing crocs
EVERY 3 MONTHS A PERSON IS TORN TO PIECES BY A CROCODILE IN NORTH QUEENSLAND >:6
I didnt even know crocs could read signs lol
Population control
And somehow this idiot will live a long healthy life.
How are we ever going to get to watch a “croc eats tourist” video, if you keep hunting the tourists away!?
At least He’s got a stinger suit on 😂
Crocs ard the most scariest beast, you dont see them coming
He should have some common sense he is provaly a settler lol
How disrespectful to the crocodiles. Never get in the way between them and their prey.
Cant fix stupidity
If a North Queensland native warned me about anything I would take the advice.
What’s worse is the muppet actually sounds Australian! 😳🤦‍♂️😂 (I’m Australian so I can say that..🤣)
Let natural selection do its thing
Saltys, in my opinion, are the scariest predators on Earth! I'd rather be eaten alive by a Polar Bear
He looks like a shy guy.
Crocs !!! Jaysus ! I’m Australian and you always check with the locals.
Croc: "Jummy, jummy, jummy! Don't mind pesky locals mate, go ahead, enjoy, explore the beautiful nature! See yaaaa!"
Don’t bother trying to save fools! Let them do us all a favor!!!
Crock needs a meal, leave him be.
If you ever needed any more evidence that there is a lot of untreated mental illness in Australia then here you go!
I’m fully aware of it. Where are the signs?  This guy’s well informed
Don’t tell me how to die!!!
What an absolute village.
He’s more upset because people end up saying the crocodile is the problem. The problem are the humans going to where they live. This man wants to protect his fauna.
I distinctly saw two brown crocks in the video. Anyone else see them??!
If you look closely you can actually see two the crocs waiting.
Up here in FNQ we rely on the crocs to keep s**t out of the water.
Next week, Man reported missing in North Queensland. Last seen swimming with crocs
Natural selection
Where's the part 2? ...or maybe the 2 parts?
Just let him get his Darwin award.
Ummm why are they bothering him. He's just enjoying himself.. it's not their place to bother. If the crocodile eats him it's his choice
Let natural selection do it's thing. He ignored you and all the signs? Welp, you tried 🤷‍♀️ sit back and watch the show
Just let them get eaten.We need less of these people
It’s obvious he’s trying to die.. when your more concerned about someone life than themself. You can only pray for them.. you might get hotter trying to help any other way.
Natural attrition
Type of fool that'll get attacked and go there were no signs 🫠
Was he really thinking the croc had to read the sign?  Cos there’s no other rational explanation for his Darwinism
Bucket list stuff
And not just 1 person but 2! A guy and a girl.
If he gets chewed up it's called the Darwin awards
Yeah right-o 😂😂😂😂
Fool
Idiocracy at its best 👌
Todays  Darwin Award  winner ?
Dude on the floaty thingy, you should’ve just salted n peppered yourself, chances are you will end up coming out of the back end of a salt water crocodile
Chopp Chopp
Bro if two Australians warned you, its time to get out and go home.
North Queensland is riddled with crocs and this guy is doing him the favor by telling him if a croc is under him and hes splashing like that with his hands CHOMP goes his hand and then a deathroll soon after to rip off said hand
So, do you still see her (alive) today?
Just like the surfers who go out at dawn , dusk .. They have been told for decades now that is shark feeding time and wonder why they get attacked.. People just have no common sense anymore
The left wing on holiday.
I wouldn't eat that.😊
Hopa Crocs had a good lunch😊😊😊😊😊
Quiet please, Australia is already overpopulated and the funeral parlour is a bit quite this week.They have got a half price special this week.😂😂😂
Gross
yum yum happy Croc
Hopefully he got done
He's even got the grey hair of alleged wisdom.
Putting Darwin’s works to good use! Probably best to let him remove himself from the human gene pool.
“Where’s the signs”? As if it’s not a body of water in Australia that has salt water. Aren’t they everywhere there’s water like this? I know in Florida and Louisiana they just assume they all have gators in them. I’d assume it’s way worse with crocs
Bro crockblocking.
Let him get eaten.
Darwinism at its finest 👏
If its dangerous ask any Aussie he'll tell ya.
Don’t blame the crocodile!!! Love that
Nah if he wont listen, I would have left him in the water and get me some popcorn and a drink. Better than any Nature documentary
I'm from Louisiana and I can't tell you how many times people gotta be told not to go in the water. If you touch the water and it's wet...it's got alligators in it. Common sense bro
Idiot
Yes, it's not easy at all trying to save a total id!ot
Natural selection
Famous last words “I am aware”, followed by “where’s the signs?” What is wrong with blind people who travel alone. Croc bait!
I played backyard cricket up in Darwin visiting from NZ,4 & 6s that’ land in the bush near a waterway,just leave it,new ball
Go and swim mate , u are a good lunch
American Tourists! 🙄 😕 NO WONDER PEOPLE CAN'T STAND US!!!😕 (Giving those poor crocs a three day bellyache! 🙀😱)
I am not saying I want him to get eaten, all I am saying is he may learn more if its feet first.
Is that a normal outfit to wear on a paddleboard?
talking about crocs while wearing crocs..just an observation lol
After attempting to warn the man, the locals decided to let Darwinism take its course.
Natural selection, don't ruin the croc's dinner.
What parts of Australia aren't deadly?
You sound like a dushbag
Brah. Don’t spoil the crocs dinner. 🙄
Somtimes you got to let natural selection do its thing
Have your fun, crocs gotta eat too.
There are some dumb arses around.
If either an Australian or Florida man tells you something is dangerous believe him.
Where's the rest of this video and why is that guy dressed as a smurf?
I'd pay too see it !!!! Blue croc bait goes hard!!😅😅
He is just trying to warn him and the guy acts like he is a karen.
Not only waiting for fish  , they are also waiting for DUMB tourist doing dumb things .
Is he actually an Aussie???
You did your best. The horse ain’t thirsty. The last thing to go through their mind when the croc death rolls them will be your words😳
Let him be. This is the Darwin awards, manifested. This is great for the gene pool.
Good young people explaining the danger. Extremely foolish tourist. The tourist will say " mind your business theres no crocs here." Then goodbye hands and feet...... He has been given advice ...no common sense at all.
Hopefully the crocodile tickled him a little, seems like he would love it
Why would you argue?why would you want to be in waters populated by reptiles of unusual size
Just probably a rich old snob from where i live Melbourne smh some people have no idea 🙄
Close to Darwin. Let his theory play out
The man he let out when the woman started floored me 😂 I could almost hear him thinking take me now if your gonna croc 😂😂😂
I think Darwin will set him straight
JUST FILM IT. DONT WARN HIM.
Darwin just added a page.
crocblocking at its highest
Now you know what it's like talking to a democrat in America.  "F your facts and truth, truth and facts are fascist nazis!"
You cant tell anybody anything. Even if its obvious
Darwin Award. Sometimes people take themselves out of the gene pool all by themselves, hopefully before breeding
Let cookie monster live his life
Great idea to listen to a local when they tell you your in danger
Ah come in mate ,, the crock has been waiting ,, nd you just took his lunch😂😂 sometimes natural selection is a thing
I didn't even hear fu##, in the whole conversation. Hahahahaha.
Trying to what, paddleboard on a boogie board? In a wetsuit in 80° weather? Just let the crocs have him
Crocks need to eat too mate
Leave him be. One less idiot on the planet eaten by crocodiles. We got too many idiots to deal with.
I wanna know the ending  !   Did he get to get close and personal with a croc ?
Leave him fckn dip💩 . It's like warning someone not to walk past a danger barrier, and they do, minutes later screaming out because it's fallen off the edge.
Do you know what they call a guy like that in Australia? ................Bait.
let him die, you gave him a blatant warning. If he decided to not heed your warning so be it. whatever happens to him is on him
Only 2-3 Australians are killed per year by crocodiles because they are trained from youth to be smart. Meanwhile 300 plus die on the Nile river and 400 plus thru the coastal sweep North of Australia thru India to Vietnam Total worldwide is close to 1000.
That guy paddling on is little board in salt-water crocodile infested waters needed to be arrested for utter stupidity.
Them crocs really hate your voice rn
Natural selection 😂
He's food
Allah akbur....let these idiots get eaten.....
Letting him go would be a community service in allowing natural deselection to occur
Don't say anything. This lineage should end here😂
When an Australian says to you that there’s danger and you can die from an animal whith what you’re doing, believe them.
He'll be fine.
He’ll be fine. The crocs read the signs, realise they’ve been rumbled and just go elsewhere. Obviously 😂
you in Australia the key to be safe is in being at the airport departing section...
Croc: “let that man live….. for now “
Please allow nature to take what shouldn't reproduce
😂😂😂😂
At least he won’t get stung by a box jellyfish or suffer from severe sunburn.
Mind your business and let the man learn the hard way 😂
Yummy,blue idiot for free 😂😂
It had to happen after so many billions of them ended up in the ocean. Condoms have evolved!
when someone with that accent tells you to get out of the. water you do it NOW
Let natural selection take these people. Trust the science!
If I ever see a dude dressed up in a blue latex suit hand paddling a piece of styrofoam in the ocean, I’m gonna assume he has more problems than crocs trying to eat him.
Let him go...... crocks need to eat, too.
one less idiot
Typical Australian crying over someone else's decision.
Just let natural selection take its course.
When they think they ruled the world...
Just let him be stubborn. I love seeing stubborn people fail. Would say "wow" and smile if he would get attacked
What a Crocblocker lol
White people deserve it
Dope
Bunch of Downers
Salt water crocs are not something to trifle with.
Watching this it's possible that crocodiles are good for society. They serve as a spectre forcing people to cooperate and look out for each other.
Does anyone know how this ended?
Eh let him be an example to others 😂
Let natural selection take place
MOHAA
He's probably been killed , digested and shat out by this stage
Fwit 😂
People like that are suppose to get eaten.
And in Brisbane it would be a bullshark
I imagine Australia to basically be a test server for a nation of Floridaman 😂
you know its dangerous when we Aussies put up signs  in 27 different languages and brail  that have pretty self explanitory pictures as well
I must say, I have never had to worry about crequedoyles in my entire loyfe. I am privileged
Aussies will swim just about anywhere. The few places they won't swim? There's a very good reason.
Silly knut
FNQLD is such a beautiful place to live. I loved living in Cairns 😊
That's how I imagine a normal Aussie interaction
See you later alligator After while crocodile
You’re like a bucket of KFC baby!
It would have been cool if a crocodile attacked right at that moment he said "just leave me to do my thing"😂😂😂 ok snackman.
how thick can a man be with only one head
Wouldn't go in there in a submarine tbh
Common sense is rare these days… signs and locals can’t bring it back.
Let the man explore 😈😈😈😈
There’s no helping stupidity 😱
Natural selection. Self inflicted idiot culling, we need more of it.
Let the leftie swim with the crocs
"Yeah Righto"
Let powder over here get eaten. You cant help everyone
You can’t save everybody
Natural selection
The guy in small board , yelling back : " I will like to experience the croc death roll thing. I heard it was fun. Maybe, who knows i can do the death roll on the crock instead"
As soon as he copped an attitude i would’ve said good luck 👍
How mad would it have been if the croc actually grabbed him on camera 📱 and started eating the idiot.
Not sure if "North Queensland" and "common sense" belong together.
Sometimes, you just have to let Darwin be Darwin.
There's always one who the he or she knows better than everyone warning him.  Let Darwin take care of it.
Let the self entitles vaccinated sheep get eaten. Hes probably from stink sheep town melbourne. Brainless covid vaccinated
Salties don't muck around.
Fkn Muppet
Future Darwin Award Winner
If he doesn't want help then do give him any help and let him be a meal for a salty.
HES ON SMOKO.  SO LEAVE HIM ALONE
🤦🏽
Woke dude with no common sense
Bell...ended thanks to the crocs doing humanity a favour
Go ahead mate! lol
He thought he was in Barry island 😂😂😂
Also, if there's no crocodile sign, that means there are no crocodiles nearby because crocodiles only hang around places with a crocodile sign.
😂😂😂
the crocodile has to eat give it some dinner
Lunch delivered.
Probably American
they got Americans in Australia?
Blue will protect me from the crocs
Dude hit em with the “yea right”
Shhh that's how it works.. Charles Darwin
Do we need people who need signs?
Let him go the poor Croc has to eat😂😂😂
"You go do your thing and I'll feed the crocs".
Fish and idiots!
he sounds like the morons we have living in our south...in australia its their north. The educated just dont know the wild areas as much..unfortunately all the southerner knows in america is the wild. lol.
Man arguing with Australians in Australia about Australia is a very risky game 😂
Bro literally trying to save your life and you want to argue 😂
You, out of the gene pool!
Hey he warned them oh well
Darwin award nominee there
One croc says to the other, “Fancy a Smurf for lunch??” 🤣
And this year Darwin award go to... the f*ing lunatic smurf paddling with his arms in crocodile infested water 👏👏
Lucky Crocs
“Idiot. More for me” 🐊
I didn't see no croc, just an aussie karen 😂
And the Darwin award goes to the nut paddling in croc infested waters
Don't even bother! Let them eat him.the crocks are hungry 😂😂
What a complete buffoon 😂😂😂😂😂
Man, I would take the most direct path and swim with the most terrified and efficiently powerful calm you ever saw.
Don't bother let the dumb f*** get eaten Make sure you video it so you have content f*** him
Stop interrupting natural selection.
Camera man never dies
Childhood video of crocodile hunter getting his first warning
If the guy is American in the water, let him get eaten. This is coming from another American.
After the rude response? Id Shhhhhhhhh just record the future prize winner 🐊 🤪
Where are the Aboriginal people in these Australia videos. Always British people.
He was duly warned....Darwinism in action.
Had too many boosters & feels safe as😂😂😂😂
Somewhere Darwin is smiling…
This is a man who is fullt aware of his surroundings. He looked for signs and he didnt see any. Leave the man alone! Crocs are smiling, stitch is coming all dressed in blue!😂
never expected to see such anti-croc hatred!  Yet here they are!
Croc:  oh yeah… lunch time
them saltwater crocs are no joke they can get massive !!!! not like a great white shark that think its a seal. Them crocs will come back for 2nds
“let a thousand flowers bloom as i say 🥰✨🌸💐But I’m not gonna spend anymore time on it 🤬because every 3 months in Australia someone’s TORN APART BY A CROCODILE”
Guy is truly insane 🤔🙄
CROCS DINNER WAITING
What a complete idiot. Yeah let's swim in croc infested waters.
Tourist just don't want to listen his paddling is a food sign for crocodile
uhh, spongebob, i think i know if it's safe to paddle here or not.
Idiots likes that are the ones that goes on to be on the news that there is a killer crocodile or killer shark in the waters😅
Don't @ him - this is equivalent to y'all drinking/smoking while the doctors tell you to stop but you say I'm well aware but where's the signs. 🥀🤷
Boomers always think they're smarter than everyone as they still can't print to PDF.
FAFO!
Same people that want to flood their own country with illegals
In North Queensland, The easiest way to test the waters for crocodiles , is to fell that water ... If it feels wet, " there's a crock in it!!"😂 MATE!!
Florida man can't hold a candle to this guy. Lol
Let the lord take him he sent him there
😂😂😂😂😂
He seems to have a death wish😂😂
Wrap him in bacon and ring the dinner bell y'all. Stop croc-blocking.🍽🐊
As much as I appreciate your advice to this guy, let's just let natural selection take care of him.. He's quite obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Let him become food its what he wants and its one less idiot on the planet
The female was the deciding factor. 😂
Why tell on those poor hard working crocks?Mind your own business.Some people......
PAPA SMURF ON THE MENU
The crock would literally oneshot  him and his little boat
The man in the 💦 fore sure he is on the left side
Did he get the Darwin award?
Imagine arguing with someone who is telling you that your in croc waters.... I'd just get out it's not worth the risk
Do you know where you are😂😂😂
It’s not that big a deal. Just wait for the show.
Survival of the fittest
Who would miss him. He is not going to influence the gene pool.
Reminds me of man in kayak off  Australia  coast panicking over great white pointer
He loves arguing! Let’s see how his argument goes with a croc!
Ahhhh looga dah size ahim he'd SMASH that kwokadie
That blue suit will scare off the crocs. The  salesman said so. He's a pom.😂
Idiot has two levelheaded people trying to save him. Idiots cannot be saved!
Darwin Award contender 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Darwin award coming his way!
He wants to die
Just hear me out, I swear I’m not a croc when I say this, but he’s good bro, just leave him be.
Don't waste your breath. It's not possible to fix stupidity
The darwin awards are for a reason
Guy on board after crocodile chomps his board: God why did you make no way for me to avoid the crocodile?  God: I sent you a warning.
Life advice  No matter what   Always take an Australians advice about anything pertaining to nature
"Only crocs I see are on your feet, mate" 😂😂  Bro wants to die.
Don’t waste your time trying to explain common sense and logic to entitled morons. Let them learn the hard way.
just let him get eaten jeez
What an idiot don't tell.him anything
Lol yeah that bright blue chroma suit is like "please do eat me" sign
He's a Democrat, Just let the crocodiles explain to him !
"A few moments later"  Oh no, there will be no more moments later..... DumbDumbDumb! Well, you warned him... 😂😂
darwin award incoming
man sonic the hedgehog looks rather rough lately
People love problems 🎉
Future Darwin Award Winner right there 🙄😲
Go ahead mate if you want to meet your maker 😅
Leave the dumb Aussie to it. Survival of the fittest 😂😂😂
Y will NEVER catch me in Australian water. I know for a FACT I’ll get eaten by a Great White. We have them here but they don’t eat ppl whole like they do over there. I saw that video!!
yeah, righto
Thinning the herd. Leave him alone 🖐🏽✋🏼goodbye
And the NQueensland Darwin award goes to
imagine being triggered when people are concerned of your safety
Natural selection at its absolute finest
Leave the croc bait alone 😂
He so would have blamed the crocodile
Leave him alone. With the crocs. Minus one idiot is good for thw world.
How much do you want to bet that the man in blue ignored warnings..wonder if he survived.
That is absolutely insane if that’s up north wow
I THINK THIS DUDE WILL STILL BE SUPRISED WHEN HE SEES CROCS COMMING FOR DINNER
Darwinism..
Listen to Steve mate. He knows crocodile more than anyone else.
No no, see if he figures it out before he becomes lunch
Fun fact about people from out of town, their common sense isn’t your common sense. If you are not from an area how could you possibly have a common level of sense about it?
You’d feel like the biggest idiot wearing that getup
If somebody you are warning to save their life, and they dispute your advice even just once why carry on, I’m a firm believer in.   he who is willing to stick his face into a beehive, will Come out with more than nose full of honey - Del Boy Trotter 😂😂😂
He's literally a dinner bell 🔔 😂
"Crocs love the boat ramp they wait around for fish" I didn't realize fish in Australia can launch and drive their own boats
Tourist not listening to locals .
He didn't use the c word thats super polite :)
“There only signs mate” your legs are only your legs mate……
Blue smurf is going for the Darwin award...
I love how he’s wearing all blue, because in and emergency it’s always best to camouflage yourself from emergency services so they don’t find ya
I mean he's fully aware of it so his problem if the crocs start snacking on him. I say let him do as he wants.
Stubborn arrogance can be deadly.
Just goes to show you can't help 'entitled' peeps!
Nothing worse than a Crockblocker.
How can you not listen to advice from the locals  that given to keep from being eaten by a crocodile…. He’s in self destruct mode 😮
Natural selection is sometimes not so bad
Cleansing the gene pool 🧬
Hes an idiot. Id warn him once, if he told me he was fine, id wish him luck and be on my way. You cant save everyone, especially not really dumb blokes like him.
Natural Population control
Darwinism will fix this!
Todays Darwin Award winner !
Is that another one of our Back Packer friends?
Shhhhh. This is how Darwin’s theory plays out. Let it.
Darwin...
I just let people do their thing, it’s called natural selection.
Typical entitled yt people
Darwin award nominee
If someone you have no relation to and don't know at all is telling you there's crocodiles in the water I'd have to take their word for it why would they lie about something like that🤣😂
Just stop and let darwin do its thing
Crocodile 🐊 human food  Nice 👌
Once in Pensacola I was swimming by the peer and had all these people staring at me….tell My brother I get home and he said uh that’s where the sharks are they were probably like look at this crazy  MF swimming with the sharks, what’s watching getting eaten?
Let them thin themselves out
Narcissism is deadly. The assumtion i know more than you no matter what.
Just let nature take its course
D ckhead swimming around on a bait biscuit
I love the accent ❤
That that man get a Darwin Award. I mean sometimes .. you got to let them move out their fantasies! He looks like a Dundee! 😂😂😂😂
I once swam in Cairns, and when I got out of the sea locals walked towards me and said I was crazy. Why? is asked? They said "M8 these waters salt-water crocodiles"
If an Australian says don’t swim in there… I wouldn’t. I’m Canadian and afraid of my own waters.
Where is the sign?? Why must i need a sign that people put up, what of someone or the rain removed the sign just like one other tragedy that happened.
Isn't it illegal to interfere with nature in Australia? How do you interrupt those crocs meal.
An Stop getting all the animals killed because you want to take a walk in the woods with bears tigers and mountain lions then scream when you get attacked! You are in their Home! Humans are so entitled it’s pathetic!
In the interests of fututre of the human race, please let the crocodiles eat these people
Let him find out!!🤫😒
its a body of water  in Australia   mf something is living in that body of water amd wants you for a tasty snack 😅
Poor croc babys get no meal today 😢
I guess he thinks he is Steve Irwin. 😂
He definitely from London 😂
if you hear an aussie say its dangerous. you best believe it.
where's the news report of a warned man bitten by croc 😅
"When you get done by it"   He was sick of him 😂😂
Why is the guy wearing burkini?
we do not interfere with natural selection. let mother nature do her job.
Warn and then step off
Let him feed the crocs jeez
Hes lucky it wasnt a drop bear area
Looks like this guy's skeptical inflated ego might just turn him into a pile of croc 💩
I have so many questions. Where did you buy what you are wearing? Why blue? How did you get it on? Why are you alone? Why are you on that board looking like an absolute fool, Why are you arguing, Just why why why, How did you get to be there, on your own wearing that, I am so confused. Are you a penguin?
Good people are saints not letting darwin take this people
Starting a conversation with "use your common sense" isn't helpful. The male ego will only dig down even further.
just kind of common sense
❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
Some people are just not willing to listen.
When the local are warning thats mean dangerous
Crocks looking at him and thinking , They sure wrap food up in silly dressing
The man is just trying to delete himself in peace. 😂
With an idiot like him, just don't say anything! Not worth the effort,!
Straya 🤷🏼‍♂️
Thats unintentional suicide - right there .
Camera man is a nosey neighbour for sure
We actually lost a tourist in Darwin doing this exact thing. Locals told her about the crocs, she decided she knew better…no more tourist.
There is a croc in the video!!!! On his feet.
If he wants to argue, leave him. Nautral selection has a hard enough time with warning labels, so let it have one walk freely into its arms 😂😂😂
The crocodiles are waiting for fish at the boat ramp. You are the fish 🤣😂
LoL 🤣🤣🤣
Natural selection at its finest
Tourist!! A true Aussie knows haha absolute tool deadset!!
It's on your foot dude..
North Queensland is enough. FAR North Queensland is more than enough. If I smell salt I don't even dip my toes in that water. The lurkers are lurking for you under and around the surface.
Just let the crocodile eat him
Let him get eaten , film it and post it on youtube .
🐊 in Queensland: Over 1000 kg and over 7 metres long. I wish you the best 💀⚠️
My hometown. I see there are still ignorant people who seem to think they know better. What would a local know. 🥴
It’s always the boomers. This proves they got lucky their whole lives 🤣
The world is full of these lefty entitled idiots. Let the crocs have their fun and save yourself the bother buddy. I would listen to locals all day long.
It beggars belief
Always listen to a local. Even if you think they’re not fair dinkum.
“Oï mate, don’t scare the Smurf away!”
human studity knows no bounds....
He wants to be eaten I guess
Bout as Diaperhead as u can get. Fkm all !! Retards that they All Are
lol.  This is funny as.
Imagine arguing with the locals about where the crocs are 😂
Surely the same logic should apply to NSW, Victoria and Western Australian shark infested waters.
Didn't know crocs could read!
Darwin Awards Candidate, let him do his thing! They won’t find the leftovers 😂
His luck will run out soon
Natural selection...,
His death should be ruled as a suicide if he gets eaten by Crocs. Every once in a while you find yourself siding with the insurance company.
And the Aussie bloke is wearing crocs too 😂😂😂
I say let him play FAFO.....
Crocs gotta eat thou!
Why would you not listen to an Australians advice while you're in Australia? Dumb
A great example that not everybody is born with common sense.
Hes got some nerve. Crocs love people.
Is that like a blue bodysuit?? Think the crocs are owed this one..
Temporary Tourists 🐊
Natural selection leave him to it.
How did this end?
The result of helicopter parenting: "No dear, you can do whatever you want and I'll deal with anyone who says otherwise."
No one gonna talk about how weird he is, dressed in a blue onesie paddling with his hands going half a mile an hour so random lol what kind of hobby is that
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it!" Words to live by there.
Natural selection failed - his parents bred him!
I'm not getting anywhere near Australia and if I do I'm not going near any body of water over there
So this is the guy who Bob katter was talking about with a man being eaten 1 in every 3 months in northern Queensland.
The tree of life is self pruning
Crocodiles are one of the very animals on earth that view humans as prey. So if you’re in its territory, it will hunt you and eat you.
These guys voted for albanese, let them die.
Guys if it is a saltwater croc he is dead bec they are very angry predator and they will eat anything they get there hands on. I saw one bite into a Toyota hilux
How is a sign going help him if the Croc 🐊 decides to crash out on him
I agree With @SeonStronghold stop crocblocking. 😁✌
& he couldn’t be dressed more like a tasty lunch if he tried!! 😂😂
If he survives there he should try out the gators in Florida
Ah usual lobster not listening to the people of the land
Don't bother,crocs don't like .....      "SMURFS" 😂😂😂
W ⚓️s both of them
As if they care about that guy's life.
If it's not the crocodiles, it'll be the humungous sharks, or the box jellyfish, or the stone fish, or the spiders or the  snakes. Stay alive, don't argue with the locals.
Remember that German tourist who decided to go for a nighttime swim in the ocean up in Cairns? He dived into the surf and got a concussion from something unexpected in the water - a saltwater crocodile. Luckily, he didn't get eaten, but it was a close call.
Let natural selection do its thing
Idiot
😂😂😂dont blame the crocodile 👍
Some….. either get away 🏃… or they just get let go!
Leftist liberals are a crocks main food source - - - no common sense.
As a Canadian I totally understand , the people hang around the igloo  ... the crocodile will break thru the ice.... If not for the moose we keep as pets , 30% of our children under 8 would be devoured.... Brave Moose... defender of the children
Older people are like this all over Australia. I saw a bunch of 'em prise back a fence that had been erected to stop people going out on a collapsing boardwalk. From the fence you could SEE how the boardwalk was collapsing into the actual ocean. I said "guys watch out it's really unstable out there!" and the leader dude yelled back "don't worry we've signed a waiver ha ha ha."  How does that joke even work, motherf*cker?!
Lot more polite than I would of been.
Should've just kept close to film how the food chain works.
Steeling a croc's lunch????shame on you😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😅😅😅
Some people are so dumb, that society would benefit from their removal from the gene pool.
Standard outcome - it hits the 6 pm News a person has been attacked by Croc. … public  gets outraged and upset an want justice … then the hunt  is on to find the culprit / crocodile- …. that instinctively does what it does naturally, eat …. 🐊..   If something happens / 🫣seeing this film … the croc should be pardoned … allowed to live , can not be held accountable for stupidity people bring onto themselves …🙄
Let the man show that Darwin was right!
Keep filming him you'll get excellent content
Worst thing that could happen is to get done by a crock😂
Don’t interrupt Mother Nature and natural selection.
typical lefty
I once had to enter the endeavour river to retrieve a boat I told myself if get away with it once I will never risk my life like that again 😮
Natural selection at work
He's got his protective marvel suit on ,he'll be fine 😂😂
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it”… Inevitable!😅😅
Beginning of a horror film. So stubborn.
The only way commonsense is going to return if it becomes common because these people get eaten
Singlehandedly bringing Darwin to Queensland.
Release The Epstein Files🤪
I say let 'em FAFO
If they not going to listen,  leave them to it 😂
Northern Australia are infested buy crocodiles, Queensland Northern Territory and Western Australia, have warning signs be aware of crocodiles, or Croc wise, Brutus the jumping crocodile wont mind him swimming, with him in the Adelaide River, while the tourist just watch him shacking Hands with Brutus, Oh by the way it's in the NT fly to Darwin than you'll know all about it, heed the warning by the local's, lf you don't want to be Croc bait.
He won't blame the crocodile or anyone. 😂
Natural selection, mate......just carry on.
for sure that is an american
I was in Johannesburg South Africa on business with a British associate. When we went to the beach he had to go swimming, and he went beyond a kelp patch into the deep water. All the South Africans started screaming that they can see the great white sharks fins swimming besides him. When he came to shore, alive, the people began berating him and he shrugged and said they were over reacting. Our host was in total disbelief and I realized than madness runs strong in the British people.
NEVER get in the way of natural selection.
Get done by
This is just so irritating
Just let him die. Natural selection
You're not on board!!!  I'm bluemin' tuff!!!  It'll have a blue day LOL 😅
Winning an argument.
Let him be happy meal if doesn't want to listen
So crazy to me that a person who lives there has a difficult time understanding that the wildlife is dangerous
Natural selection at its best 😅
pride is Blinding
When a local tells you you're in danger you probably should listen
Why are you trying to interfere with darwin awards?
The guy is literally trying to save your life and you’re giving them attitude because you hate to be wrong, classic.
typical dikhead .. " yea righto "  get ate then fuhkwhit
what an idoit
That's a Karen
Hope the croc had a little nibble.  What a prat
Let Darwin take over who cares
You're interrupting natural selection bud!
BISCUIT: Guy just trying to spoil me fun!  GIANT RIVER DINOSAUR: ...
Idiots don't listen there the same way with the shark's
Shhhhhh.......it'll be either funny, tragic, or both.
People do the same in America. We’ve seen alligators in our waterway, by the boat ramps😊 and it’s salt water so I get why locals swear there aren’t any here… but there are😂 see em all the time and it’s funny hearing them say, “ I’ve lived here my entire life and never seen one..” till we point them out and the disbelief in their faces is funny
Exotic food
Natural selection
All I hear is “I’m a little croc bait croc bait croc bait I’m a little croc bait boyyyy so leave me alone or film if you want because I’m a little croc bait boyyyyuu😅” 🐊 🍖
Bullsharks too !
I gather North Queensland is the Florida of Australia then yea?
Really he needs signs to say croc spotted? Why on earth do we live in a age that we need everything spelled out for us. OHH coffee is hot lets  drive with the cup between our legs.. spills coffee and sues . face palms. I agree with that aussie.
This is what Karens are for.
What is the tourists accent? Swedish?
He's dressed like a fish too with his fish brain
At least he’s being sun safe!
It seems everything in Australia can eat you
Sounds American or Canadian.  Trust me, most of us do have common sense.
Sometimes you just have to let things play out.
U better take this mans warning he lives here probley 😮
SSSST! You shouldn't get in the way of natural selection...
His feeding the crocodiles 😂🤪🤣🤣
If I hear an Aussie say “Nah”,I Am walking on Water like Jesus😬
He's a f***** g idiot, let him get eaten if he wants that, he dont know whats he's playing with
Saltwater crocodiles are some of the few animals that see people as a prey item and actively hunt us.
Come on man, he's trying to help the environment. You know, feed the animals.
He’s a dead man with that attitude.
It's best to let darwinism run its course in these situations.
"NOW DONT SAY THAT, DONT SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT IRRITATES ME, AND IVE PUNCH BLOAKS IN THE MOUTH FOR SAYING THAT"
Dumazs
Let him. He has a death wish.
And, Paddle Board guy is the type to challenge a kangaroo.... bad idea.
Umm, Australia and Florida if there is water there is a croc.
These Australians are so rude not letting that guy have fun!😂😂😂
I don't know crocs but I know gators  You always listen to locals. ALWAYS. ❤from the Mississippi gulf coast
Some men have no commonsence
Don't sabotage the Darwin competition. He's about to win the Award. 😅😂
Some people need to get a brain....
Bob-Katter-Core
*🐊: "The fridge protecting the snacks"*
I’m surprised you didn’t check his vaccine ID card and tell him to put a mask on. That’s the state of Australia today.
Throw him a fish
Australian - there’s big crocs right over there in the water mate!   Louisianans and Floridians - oh great LUNCH!!!!
Aren’t you just a proper Crockblocker. 🤣
He got defensive because they attacked him. When anyone is making a mistake or doing something wrong, if you're serious you'll handle it appropriately, instead of attacking out of ego.
when your on the smallest paddle board ......in a dinosaur pool ....I mean its amazing this guy is still alive
Darwinism at it's finest
BUT  I AINT WAISTING ANY TIME ON IT
"Croc-Blocker"!!!!
Darwin awards were invented for a reason 🤷‍♂️! Please stop getting in the way of cleaning our gene pool 😂
Okay, so where's the rest of the video?!  Did they 🐊 🐊🐊 get him?! 🤔
His name is (or soon will be) CHUM.
I can't believe the idiot has lived as long as he has.
Cameraman should have just said, "Okay, dy'er mind if I keep filming, mate?" He could have had a viral video if the croc took the bait...
Alligators 🐊 everywhere too
Most underrated comment ever! : “You’re in North Queensland, mate, have some common sense.”
Pull out the seat and see if he makes it to shore when the crocs go for him
Queensland has sharks, casowaries, and spiders that talk to you.😂
Don't question the free entertainment 😅
Stop being Karens - let him do his thing. Let adults make their own decisions and let them own the consequences.  Life is full of risks. What next? Stop people from hiking mount Everest.
Its like swimming in the Amazon river
You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make it drink hey. Great to see my aussie brother trying to look after a  flamin’ galah!
Seriously I'd never try so hard to save someone from themselves. Maybe sit on the bank and make a picnic while you watch the guy
Crocodile Dumb Dee
and this is what i say about  common sense it does not exist ,  to the guy with the cam it is common to crocks  but not to the surf  boarder    who may either be a newbie tourist   , a lame  city dweller  or just a weird migrant  it s all about logic and consideration that seems not to be so common
Tourists dont last long do they. We here in hawaii need to see about getting some crocs. lol
Literally Evolution in action The dinosaur is getting his dinner tonight
bro shut up n let natural selection take ita course
Couldn't the poster put in an AI croc to make it more realistic?
Wonder what his last meal was😂
He simply didn’t understand the hunger of the situation
Yeah ha, food on a biscuit
This is part of Nature's natural selection. Organisms that are less adapted  to their environment (like this guy) are less likely to survive and pass on the dumb genes.
I would genuinely like to know if that man made it back to land or not
Tie some bacon around his neck and tell him it will keep the crocks away.
Maybe he's from Darwin?
Let him learn the hard way! He has been told.
Yeah sure, do your thing...Who needs limbs, anyway?
Mind your own business. What he's doing doesn't affect you. At most, warn him politely. You are insufferable
Yeah but bloke probably fks round with his fresh kills fishing when he loads his boat down the boat ramp. But when a rando tourist wants to be eaten by a crocodile: fk off gotta save rando tourist.
Trying to save your life and that's your attitude
This is one of the times when safety warnings are real, instead of a ploy to make money. Basically a government that cried wolf situation.
🤣🤣🤣ey u did ur job sir… I’d sit out there with my popcorn after that
I wouldn't have said anything.I would have just watched s***, go down😅
you shouldn't have said nothing. these are the people that need to be done. the problem is is the sign natural selection stop doing its job and now we have these idiots that breed
Probably an American!!! 😂😂😂
Australia is essentially the worlds Florida.
theres actually a new documentary that just came out about Australia, specifically Northern Queensland.. its called Predator Badlands ;P
Let him be food fish.
I would've let Darwinism manifest as it will
Look I like to be left alone too,also love being around animals,but I wouldn't be doing that,
Arent Crocks the only living Dinosaur. Been about for thousands of years........ There is a reason for that....They Are Not Dumb as Humans.....😢
Alls you gotta know is that when people are recording while you're doing something completely harmless, just know you're in danger lol
Yum blueberry flavoured idiot  🐊💭
shoes tell me which side the cameraman's on
The realist part was don't blame the crocodile.
Let him go
im fully aware...I dont know where the signs are, and I assume they say something else when you point them out to me. so aware
He will only change his mind while he’s being eaten!
some one get filthy frank on the phone. I think i found pink guys nemesis
I see Australia also has liberals
Just let Darwinism take care of itself 😂❤
When Demoncrats want to go swimming...
“Yeah, righto” geez at that point you would have been well out of the water
1992 Freemantle Australia visiting as part of a naval group. The first Australian I spoke with warned me and my pal to stay out of the water and stay away from the billa bongs
I live on the opposite side of the world and even I wouldn't try that.
I remember when I worked in the U.S. briefly, my boss’s parents were telling me about a holiday they took to Australia. While in North Queensland, they saw a sign saying croc infested waters. The wife was sure it was a set up for tourists to make the area seem ‘more exciting’ but the husband thought they should be cautious and find somewhere else to swim just in case. They asked me to settle the argument as to whether it was a tourist prank or not (to be fair they had just recently learnt the truth about drop bears). I calmly explained to them that no, it wasn’t a prank and that those signs are there because the crocodiles are and they nearly fainted.
Yeah but did he die?
Did you forget you were videoing this? nice shoe.
You taste like chicken mate...
" When you get done by it " dude couldn’t have said it any better.
There’s a croc at the bottom left of the screen toward the end!!!!
Lmkao krickkkeeeyy imma go poke him with a stick
You do you mate 👍
Can lead a horse to water...
Crocks "Let him find out for himself"😂
And please.. No crocodile tears if u get bit..
'Where's the sign?' Why does common sense need a sign? Why?
Bro just shut up and let this guy die.... It's called Darwinism.... Survival will the fittest and all that.
Let him be food
Yeah that's right. Genius argue with a local whether or not there's crocodiles about. Someone take his picture for identifying the remains,,,,,,,
There is a process for stupidity it's  called croc food 😂😂😂
Candidate for the  Darwin  award
Why didn’t you show the crocs? BS 👎👎👎👎👎
have some fkknn common sense mate
Crocs gotta eat to mate.
bro is single handedly trying to undo millions of years of darwinian evolution.
That's a floating charcuterie board if I've ever seen one.😆
An Aussie warning another about crocs while wearing crocs, cool.
Stop talking keep filming😂😂😂😂😂 num num num
Let him get eaten
This is the liberals in America after you give them a fact
The sign is the crocks smile bro 😂😂😂
Lol, let hIm FAFO
Stop telling this blue power ranger about the crocs. Im sure no one will look for him
You Tried to Help….  Let’em FAFO .
So was the Smurf dinner for the crocks, if so can I get his Anti crock eating Dinghy thing as a Souvenir. To remind me there’s idiots in every country. Cheers 🍻😝😝😝🐸🐸🐸🐊🐊🐊🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Darwin has entered the chat
Saw a video of guy getting ripped out of a kayak on a river.. thank god all we have are gar where im from..
If they’re scared for your life, LISTEN TO THEM. They live there. They know the dangers. Locals know better than tourists. They ain’t being party poopers. They’re literally trying to save your life and protect you from harm.
Let  him get bit
Leave him alone yhe crocodiles are hungry you messing with their dinner
Natural selection....just let it happen 😂
We do this all the time in Florida!
I think the full UV bathing suit said it all
Did you feel him getting eaten?
At this point, I think we should take warning labels off things that should be common sense, stop warning people like this over and over - and let nature take it's course.
Should have burlied up the water round him.
Just let nature take it's course.
I live in Florida USA. We have both Alligators and Salt water Crocodiles. You couldn’t pay me to go in to any water with a posted sign for recently seen crocs. I always watch the water awhile before I go swimming. If I even go in. Im on high alert just fishing there…
These are the shorts I need
🤷‍♂️ one less
M0r0n
This is called natural selection. Let it be.
Should have let that dude get eaten dumb human’s shouldn’t be!
Found the liberal!
Yummy snack incoming😂😂😂😂😂😂
Only an idiot would argue like that!!, who are these people!?!?, have you seen what crocs do!?!?
There are too many dummies in the world,  just let it happen and we'll have one less.
Croc tourist biscuits.. hahahah
Save your breath, feed the crocs, save a life that's worth it.
Always listen to the local people
Why even worn that idiot just start filming the croc when he starts eating them
Crockswatters
let them eat!
Yeah naw yeah naw krikey  mate.
The fact this NPC wanted to argue. Would’ve been the perfect moment for the Croc to pop!
“Where are the signs then hmm?”  “There, there, there and on every boat launch” sent me
For God's sake, let the good old Darwin work!!!!
Why do ppl record the ground and not the interaction 😒
Glad to see they have them in Australia too😂
Fkn Iijit
WOW. Common sense is very uncommon. What a freaking lunatic
I hope he was alright, since   my viewing  this😮
Can we start calling Americans crocodile snacks just like we call small animals and some children shark bait 😂 and don't say we don't I was one of those young children who got called shark bait a lot because I'm an Australian woman now with an attitude
Croc gotta eat!
Did he get eaten
Dude! Crocs have to eat too.
That problem looks like it gonna solve itself
This is exactly what we Aussies as kids get told, you'll be warned and made aware and told don't, or it's on you, think about it while you still can
This is how is expect all Australian conversations to go 😂
Hope he gets eaten! 😂😂😂
He came prepared tho, disguised as water
WHY?
Australians are not to be second guessed about dangerous animals. And if a Canadian tells you to put on more clothes, its cold out, you should listen in a very similar manner. We each have our special fields of expertise. G'day mate!
Survival of the fittest...
Here's your sign
Natural selection at work here.. lol
We call that natural selection. Hopefully he finds what he's looking for😂😂😂
Natural selection
Thing is if he does get confronted by a crocodile he just needs to reason with it
I'd throw some bait to him ...
I know this much , you better listen to the locals
My dreams is to one day go to Australia , I would love to be there might never come home.
Be thankful when someone has enough humanity left that they care to warn you! In todays world you could be half de@d and it's a blessing someone stops to help. In many populated areas it's popular to ignore you or video your trauma for clicks. I would appreciate the heads up if I didn't see the signs.
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it
The dumb arrogance 😂😂😂
He should leave the guy alone ...the gene pool needs clearing out and that's what the crocodile is for
A future Darwin award recipient spotted in the wild
Darwin will solve this.
Darwin: Ssssshhhh, this is how it works.
Australia aint the place to play in water its like florida if theres water bet money gators in it too 😂
Funny but crocodiles can actually be seen often unlike let’s say sharks , and shark attacks are massively under reported because they’re everywhere
Ngl if an Australian told me to have some common sense id immediately stop what im doing and reconsider my life choices
Croc; shhh. I’m hungry😮😊
You have to let nature take its course, period.
See people swim n paddle board here i. Florida. State capital of alligators everywhere.
If you can remain calm, when everybody around you is freaking out. Perhaps you haven’t grasped the gravity of the situation.
When you get Done BY😅😅😅😊 Love it😅😅😅crocodile tears 😢
Just let him get eaten
Idiot
❤ Ecclesiastes 7:17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
Natural selection
What are these idiot tourists doing. I'm a north Queensland man raised and live in Brisbane and you can't swim in the oceans up north or near boat ramps. This man is only trying to save this idiot from being taken. Lol
Crocodile food 😅
Just let him win his Darwin Award.
"I didn't SEE the signs, so they don't matter...just leave me to do my thing!" - Dying?  Uh, okay.  Try not to make a lot of noise while being eaten."
Natural selection 👌
Brothers got crocs on himself you know he’s seen a thing or two
Let natural selection takeover
If a local in an area I'm visiting is straight up saying there are freakin' crocodiles ready to eat me I'm stopping whatever tf I'm doing and listening to every word!
The crocodiles can stay hungry longer than you can stay outraged that someone has told you to watch out for crocodiles
“You’re in North Queensland, man, have some common sense.”   The whole rest of the world thinking he’s talking about fashion sense 🙄  The whole rest of the world after he mentions crocs 😳
I was camping in Palm Cove, north of Cairns Queensland. I asked locals about crocs, and I got, "Yeah Mate, you'll be fine if you don't go north of town, into the estuary."  Out of curiousity I went for a little beach hike north of my campsite, and sure enough, salties playing in the waves on the beach.  Surfing crocs.  No thank you.
Imagine needing a sign to believe there crocodile's around, when you have locals telling you you're on the dinner menu. 😂😂😂
Natural selection at work getting interrupted by locals with common sense
😂😂😂😂idiot
The crocs are angry he's scaring their brekke away
bro let the evolution work plz
chum the water.
No need to be rude, be concerned, speak to him nicely.
Literally Australia... come on dog
This is Darwinism   Just let it take its course
Cast not pearls before swine, lol
If the waters wet there's sharks a cross there
This whole incident had to be AI generated as not one party called the other a "f**king c*nt" throughout the entire conversation! 🙄
It's kinda like how God told us "go ahead, mate, go mingle with the world but don't blame sin when ya get done by it".
I'm impressed he only threw in one F bomb.
In all firness, I'm not sure that crocks actually eat Smurfs!
Never argue with Australians, Floridians, or Africans when it comes to murderous wildlife and salties especially.
Go protect yourself and f*ck off!
His mates nicknamed him 'Bait'... probably.
I like the way that bloke said dont blame the crocodile cos thats what will happen
But dude is dressed like a fish, let him get eaten.
People like him will never learn nothing they think they already know it all
Let the dumb ones die!!! 😊
Nothing common about sense these days.
Just let the croc feast smh
Hey FRKN Tourist LISTEN
Sometimes, you just have to let natural selection do it's thing
Listen to that Aussies , no doubt
Let that natural selection do its thing...
They're everywhere. Glad the States aren't the only ones.
Where's the sign One there one there one there and one the crocodile took to skewer you like a kebab🤣🤣🤣
Croc blocking😂
Well, did he get eaten?  YT Shorts are too short.  They are perfect for people with short attention spans.
Sign: Please don’t feed crocodiles.
You can't argue with dumb and you certainly can't win 🤷 dinner is served 😂
Sounds like a liberal
Bro just let the nature take its course and  reduce some burden of stupidity from the Planet...
Sélection naturelle
😂😂😂 some people just need to learn to use COMMON SENSE ‼️... SMH 🤨😳🤔😳
Let Darwinism do what it does if he wants to argue.
Croc tucker!!
Nature has a way of weeding out the weak.
Just LET the croc eat him! He's annoying as fauck!
“Go ahead mate” 😹😹😹 when an Australian says go ahead. Don’t go ahead 😹☠️
Pre packaged food, ignorance is food on a float, believe the locals.
Let Darwin do his thing.
Natural selection at its best.
We get the same kind of nimrods in California who don’t want to believe you about riptides either. “Oh I know how to swim.” Okie dokie. Where’s your family sitting? Might as well go tell them to arrange services to save time later.
id just sit back n enjoy the show w a drink. cheers to charles darwin
Where’s the sign 😂  Good God man
Yes believable
As long as the croc is left alone then let him be  No getting the body back or killing the croc   Darwin Award winner and be done
If someone told me that there were crocodiles...the 1st response back is NOT gonna be "WHERE IS THE SIGN.. Like a croc isn't going to attack cause there's a sign
Let him off tafuk😅
Animals get killed because these retards don’t respect nature, they get attacked, then the animals get put down.
and we are supposed to have empathy for these people.
Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.  Proverbs 16:18
Strangest suicide attempt I've ever seen
Sometimes you just gotta let the crocs sort this level of stupud out
He wants to be a part of crocodiles healthy meal option, let that man have his dream
Darwin Award pending.
I wouldn't have argued with the warning... I would have been too busy trying to get out as fast as possible!
Could you imagine getting angry at someone trying to save your life
Why blur his face? I presume this has to do with Australia being woke and gay?
He's in the "FA" stage of FAFO
Croc blocker.
Oh my my we get this stupidity in Hawaii Every year or oceans and hike trails take lives, many Don't listen to the locals, arrogance like they know everything, then boom out to sea we go
You can't even wish good upon people these days. Dude trying to save another dudes life and he looking for SIGNS!! The other man telling you it is dangerous is also a SIGN.....
North Queensland must be like Florida. If its wet there's Gators in it, or for you guys crocs. Lol
I'd hang around just hoping for a live feeding show. . .
He doesn't need anyones help. He can show himself out of the gene pool.
He's obviously worthless...let him go.
Let nature take its course he'll either learn or......🤷‍♂️ lol
😂
This is the function of mockery and bullying. Like anything done to excess it can be harmful. But in moderation it can save your life.
Beware of crocodile mate says the guy wearing crocs.
Darwin selection of the species takes care of the imbeciles amongst us…
Hahaha go ahead mate. 😂
gday bait
Just let him go is called natural selection
Crocodiles need to eat too. This kind of anti-reptile bigotry needs to stop.
For the betterment of the species, LET HIM SWIM
People stop warning people. The Crocs need to eat.
Show me the signs.  Signs: crocodiles are here 🔄🔃⤵️↘️↩️↔️↕️↖️⬅️↙️⬇️↘️➡️↗️😂
Crocs hang around docks looking for fish but dipshits taste better.......
Liberals
Anyone know if the he survived the ride?
Don’t blame the crocodile 🐊 when you get done by it 😂😂😂 I don’t think anyone will be hearing from him again if that’s to happen MATE 😂😂😂
Blood wants them crocs to spot him a mile away with that highlighter blue he’s got on
SoCal beaches eat people all the time, a very patient ocean.
Not him saying yea right as if crocs waiting near the ramp is the most insane thing he ever heard 😂
Just like tourist in Yellowstone
Nahhh let him paddle😂 do us all a real favor
The arrogance of people like this idiot is astounding. It's the same mentality as the hal wits who go mountain rambling in snow storms or surfing in rough seas. I say leave them to it. Or fine them if they have to be rescue.
Yeah, but you have to have brains to have common sense and he apparently doesn’t or he has a death wish
Croc-blocking! 😂😂😂 🐊
It's his F.A.F.O , but i feel for the people who have to watch it.
My dad would have said this is 'tempting fate' meaning if you do this, expect the worst, because it could happen.
Natural selection .
Mate, three words: Overpopulation Natural selection😂
Waiting for part 2….😬
Waiting for objects moving around.
As a Texan, when an Aussie says you should be scared, you should be scared!!
unless hes Cajun?
As an american this reminds me of the people traveling to souther georgia and florida and paddle boarding in the canals.
Australians; Just like anywhere you have street smart ones, generally suburban peeps, country folk that are exposed to wildlife and than you get someone like me (non Australian that has lived here for 25 years + and never seen a snake/ croc other than at a Zoo.  Australia's are just more aware and the potential risk.
I think the crocs had a nice blue meal that evening.
Let Darwin work its magic.
I guess he thinks you’re all just around to make his day bad. If it was me I’d ask for a ride back to shore in the boat!!!!!’ 😂😂 I😂😂😂😂😂
What a thicko
No fool like an old fool😂
Crocs: “SHHHHHHH LEAVE HIM ALONE, we’ll keep an eye on him”
😅😮
Natural selection
Simpleton
Hey, all of you have made my day!!! Your replies have been a learning experience... "Shark biscuits," says it all.🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’d let him do his thing and start filming and watch him get eaten.
🙄
Looks like he’s up for a Darwin Award…
A Darwin award candidate. When you are that dumb your genes should be removed from the gene pool.
Honestly, I feel like it takes guts just to get in the water in Australia at all, if it’s not the crocs it’s the sharks. FTS, I’m good
its well known that there are no sharks as the crocodiles ate them all
Well, did he die
Anybody should know by now that you absolutely do not spend any time in the nature in Australia. Swimming pools only.
“Big dog mate”
You warned him he don’t listen . That’s people get eaten alive coz of their own stupidity.
I'm a little confused why we're trying to stop natural selection  If Bro wants to paddle out there let him paddle out there One less id10t taking up space
The croc agrees with the guy on the board
Idiot
Dude is looking for suicide by crocodile 🐊
Is this man still alive?
one should not interfere with Darwinism in progress
Sometimes you just have to let nature take its course.  Survival is not for the feeble minded.
SERIOUSLY There's No Telling Some People.
If he wants to feed the crocs... let him.
The croc: delicious meal deliver right to my door.
Always carry a bucket of chum.
Darwin award nominee..🤣
Stupidity + Arrogance = Wildlife Brunch
There’s a crocodile waiting for him around the corner. He’s hungry as a crocodile is.
Let him go - one way to clear oxygen thief’s off the planet
Is he wearing Crocs on his feet!? 😂How ironic!
Why can't people mind their own business?
Muppet let him get eaten would do the world of good
Absolute buffoon
Democrat American
If the guy sounds like crocodile Dundee or crocodile hunter u better listen I would be gone as soon as I hear the accent lol 😂😂😂
I would like to see what happened next. Did the crocodile get blamed?
Dipstick
People swim in the ocean all the time even though there's sharks jellyfish rock fish bacteria and who knows what...go cry to them to get out of the water. He knows the risk and accepts it
A crocodile in the ocean? First time for everything
I looked it up-. the water is warm yr round in this area - what's this get up he's wearing?  so he's not bitten by a 🪼 but he has no regard for the crocodiles around him though?  😃Dude is a might confused.  🐊
He must not have any marbles at all left and is just full of air up in the brain region🫢😞 self selection is a thing😂
should of let fate take its course.
Let the croc have him ,nobody else will
Croc's over there saying "Shut up mate...you're crockblocking. Stop it!"
I don’t go in the water any where down south.  Too dangerous for me. Even up north now.
Everyone watching this is expecting a crocodile to get the bloke. What a let down!
F it let him get eaten he obviously doesn't care! You tried!
There is nowhere safe to swim in Australia or Florida 😄
LUNCH ON A PLATE❤
Lady Karma  Works in mysterious ways...   Even convincing a man  To go boarding in croc infested waters.  Like a zombie, he goes....   Wild. Be kind to others
Stop spoiling feeding time. Just gotta grab my popcorn, n im rdy for this.
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it.” 😂😂😂 Sounds like every parent to a child!
You can't be dumb in Australia lol
Oi, blue sausage  -- crocodile, probably
Idiot
I tell you what the second someone starts running their mouth cause I try to warn them about crocodiles. I’m gonna set up a chair and watch for this crocodile. I’m all done warning.
He doesn't want the help so don't feel bad , you tried to be a good neighbor.
Leave him be. He wants to become croc snack so badly, I think he's earned it.
American response : yeah **** you buddy I DO WHAT I WANT (in cartman jennifer lopez voice) Aussie argument response: yeah ok right-o!
Let Darwin do his thing, mate. I doubt that idiot is a productive member of society. Some people are born to serve as a statistic, as a warning to others.
Does it say Darwin award on his forehead?
If you dress like a teletubby you’re playing with fire
This is what Eric Clapton’s song Tears in Heaven was written about. “Would you know my name…if you saw me bitten in half mate”  Such a sad song about loss and death…
Aussies are scared of their own shadow..! let that man do his thing enjoy the water and the beautiful day... just because you're scared doesn't mean everybody should be.!....get lost
Just let him swim.
Darwin was right.
How dare this guy interfere in the Crocs lunch.
I’m a crocodile and I approve this message
I have to agree with the blue man. I mean how dare the man on the boat but especially the crocodile. Sure the crocodile knows he is just out for a paddle.
Go get eaten yum yum
Difference between  crocodiles and alligators is  Gators might defend themselves from humans but almost never attack us unprovoked. We are literally on the crocodiles menu. They will stalk and hunt us.
dont underestimate crocodiles! never!
What a toolshed. .
Yea but in the end mind ur business, if he gets eaten by a croc he will learn the hard way.but u do u.
natural selection.
Crocs don't eat Kiwis so he's safe.
Hard to dumb.
i warned you twice, now i will just film, will be good footage
Natural selection exists for a reason and now we have people holding positions of authority with room, temperature IQ because they’ve been shield and protected by every bad decision and consequence they’ve ever made
Natural selection exists for a reason, the West is crumbling because the stupidest people on earth I’ve been protected by every bad consequence
Crunch crunch crunch yum😊
Leave him be.. he's wants to be bait 😮
"Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it" :D
Man is obviously "special", so good they talked him through it.
Natural selection, leave him too it. Just don’t hunt the croc after for his stupidity 🤷‍♂️🐊
No fool like a old fool!
Darwinism at its finest
Now thís, boys and girls, is called ‘natural selection’
"Fools rush in where wise men fear to tread..."
Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it 😂
USA liberal on vacation?
Let the croc have its daily tool.
If an Aussie warns you about your fuckery, you've wondered off the edge of the map mate,there be monsters here 😂
Get him croc
This is the result of modern society. This is not an isolated mentality, it is WIDE spread.
Mind your buisness, natural selection exists for a reason
I live in germany and know about crocodiles in australia how dumb you have to be
When your self preservation level is zero.
If it weren't for attention seekers the social media would be boring 😂😂😂
I've been saying for years humanity are moron's 😂
is that mike nolan
I was once hunting catfish in a knee-deep estuary in WA, had the locals shouting at me from the bank. Couldn't hear what they were saying so I got out and went and spoke to them. They told me there were hundreds of lion fish in the same water and walking barefoot is a terrible idea. Needless to say, LISTEN TO LOCALS or enjoy a world of hurt
Just think how many hits you'll receive from the video of this Einstein getting Eaten...😅😅😅
And you try to do the right thing 🤔
He fully aware. Leave him tf alone
This is a croc of 💩🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are a good man. And the comment section is f-ing AWESOME!
The crock will definitely do it's thing.
Good that you warned him but remember that the Darwin rule makes our species stronger.
Leav the prik what a attitude !!!! These brainwashed lefties snowflakes need to learn on the hard way
Nature at work right there. Gonna be one less mouth to feed! 😂
You'd think the mere mention of croc would be enough but not for this hardhead.
hope the crocodile gets him though 😂😂😂
He feels safe in that blue suit.
Let natural selection do its thing!
Su¡C¡De by crocodile 🐊😅
I was really hoping to see the inevitable conclusion of this clip
Can we get an update??? Did he die doing what he loves most or did he get in the boat lol
A blue tapeworm 🤔 ah an "identifier" man karen i guess 😂
Let the natural order play itself out.
You shouldn’t have said nothing just kept filming then watch the feeding frenzy😂
Listen to the locals mate.
You, Australians are nice folks probably a better part of Americans would  just lift a camera and watch.
He claims he's fully aware, yet he asks where's the croc sign.
idiot boomer
Yea let’s argue with the locals
Manifest destiny or the guy needs to lay off the Fosters
Nah, if an Aussie warns me about something - imma listen
This is called thinning of the herd!😂
No that's aqua man, the famed crocodile hunter 🤣🤣
How much you wanna bet that woman talking at the end is a freaking stunner. Love me some Sheilas 😍
Why is the world full of idiots.
Spoken by a true lad on his third divorce, let him suffer in peace mate, this has to be less painful
Considering they have spiders big enough to have their own themes and an armor break mechanic. When an aussie tells you to to watch it, you watch it
Look man, just sit back and allow natural selection to do its job. It's a vital cycle that needs to happen.
Australian person tells you the animals nearby are F*ckin C*nts you listen and you leave.
Keep paddle boarding, mate. This will make great content.😂
Anywhere north of Byron Bay, I'm just not gonna get in the water 😅
Seriously... I'm surprised that old fool made it that far and got as old as he did.
😂 the audacity.   Reminds me of my mother! 😮 You tried!
Is that a Florida man vacacationing in Australia?
Im grown dont tell me what to. HELP 😅
Is there a follow-up 😂😂 his was warned
Survival of the fittest and smartest - leave him be and let karma do her thing!
Natural selection a la croc would be a fair outcome for this imbecile.
Darwin
typical boomer
🤣 he’s not my kid. Have fun bud!
ENTITLED to the point of being eaten alive 😢
Its amazing how stubborn and defiant people are when they are told they are in the wrong and can't do something even when it means they will get eaten by a crocodile! 🐊😂
Pitiful people
Isn’t gen Z supposed to film a guy eaten by crocks
Europeans behavior 😊 what Black People been telling you 😊 No Fks given 😊
Hey just let the liberal do what it needs to do. Population control..
Always BELIEVE THE LOCALS ! 😳
The idiots name is Leonard Venrooy, he's a national pest
If an Australian tells you to get out of the water get out! I wouldn’t swim in a puddle in Australia
an Aussie can tell me something but an Aussie telling an Aussie haha idk
Ahhh, to be “ done” by a croc & still be able to “ blame” it would be a grand accomplishment mate !
" there's crocodiles here" " oh yeah,, well,, same to you"
Toughest dudes on the planet
North Queensland or otherwise, you're in Australia. I would just stay out of the water. If it's not crocodiles, it's sharks or jellyfish.
RIP that fella.
Glad its just not Dumb Americans
Leave him. Let natural selection take it's course.
Cute outfit🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Warning people about Crocs while wearing Crocs
Natural selection at its best.
Leave him alone mate he want to be good.
What a friggin idiot!
The defining characteristic of gators is you don't see them before they strike lol.
Always ask the locals first
He's acting like they're telling him it's a no swimming zone or something😂 No dude, they're just telling you there's a high probability that there's a crocodile currently hiding under the water waiting for some idiot to come splashing up😂
God's way of thinning the herd!!😂
You're in Australia acting wild!  When Australians tell you not to do something don't do it.
We kayak with them in the Everglades. They are everywhere and are used to humans on kayaks so they never bother anyone
Absolute plonker
Would have loved to see the end result 😏
Great camera work mate......not.
Labour voter.
Some people just want to die, let him go in his own way.
DARWIN.... was right ;-)
Crocodile yeah lay off him of he wants to swim let him swim
Zero survival instincts. At the first sound of "crocodile" I'd quit ever getting even 10 metres close to any water mass.
One bite his gone then it's the Crocs fault really now brainless
That song comes to mind. Your a dumbasz your a dumbasz and your going to be a  dumbasz your whole life 😂😂😂
Throw some chum in the water next to him for a good laugh
Just let Natural Selection take its place....
His name is Chum😂😂😂
next tell the zionist masonic fake jew kazars and leftists that there is water owned by  catholics and muslim in the water  then these zionist masonic fake jews can meet the saltiestooth
Is he looking for Nemo?!? He’s dressed up like Dory!
Maybe he wants to get eaten as opposed to laying in a nursing home and waiting for the end🙃to come that👉way!!!😮😢😊
This ungrateful food parcel!!
Crocodile catchers have clearly had enough of Antipodean busybodies…
Stay in the water.  Keep marinating.
Let him get ate. Crocks gotta eat too
Some people will never admit they’re wrong, even if it might cost them their life.
What are you his Mom? Not so great Brittan
I would've swam ashore packed my bags and left the country.
Leave bro alone, he's winning insurance for his kids😂😂😂😂😂
Every self respecting Auzzy knows, Crocodiles don't eat smurfs!
If an Australian or a Floridian takes the time to tell you that you are going to die if you keep doing what you are doing.... maybe listen, they probably have some experience.
I remember an episode of Bush Tucker Man where he (Les Hiddins) had to cross a river and stated that there was absolutely no way there could be crocodiles there. And then he drew his revolver before crossing. Lesson learned.
how dumb people can be
Just let these people go
Let him. It's a darwin thing
He even dressed like a fish! 😂
Scared Weird Little Guys weren't asked by the Ozzy Tourist Board to write a warning song for nothing
it's not the crocs you can see that you have to worry about, it's the the ones you can't see but they can see you
He wins the Darwin award!
this video should be proof of the crocodile's innocence
He's dinner haha 😂
Let natural selection take it's course.
Saltwater crock? No thank you!
Ok I understand dudes concern, but does he have to be so rude and condescending? What happened to us? It seems like COVID made us all insane. Everyone is so angry at everyone. Did the actually inject people with some kind of anger inducing chemical? Because you can’t deny there is a huge uptick in not only just people being angry for no reason like the guy in this video, but also in insane crazy fit throwing tantrums at strangers in public. Americans are so angry at each other right now that I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if a civil war breaks out. I wish there were some way to get people to stop fighting and see what’s being done w to us. We are all on the same team. We are all human beings dealing with the struggles of existing
Never stand in the way of Darwinism.
Can't help everyone 😂
Don’t blame croc when you get done by it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awful way to commit suicide, but you do you
This is called natural selection.
"I'm fully aware of it, let me do my thing and you do yours."  Crocodile: "Yeah, let my lunch do as it pleases"
Natural selection 🐊 let him enjoy... A snack😂
Natural selection at work.
But they are the superior race,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 idiots
I was told by an Aboriginal up that way. If you see black fella swimming is safe. If you see white fella it's not safe. Point just proved
Darwin’s theory proven real time .
Maybe he's paddling to Darwin to pick up his award?
These morons get to vote
Should have kept quiet , The gene pool is in need of a solid
This guy is an accent is enough for me to be like all right I'll get out
"Natural Selection" in process.  Do humanity a favor and stop interfering in the process.
In Cairns if all places. He should wear a "free snack" sign.
Wow
Some people can’t be told
i saw atleast two crocs in this video
its mental
When Aussies offer life saving advice fu@@ing heed it. G’day from a Pom
At that point I’d just take out some popcorn and wait
What is he WEARING
No this guy does not deserve people help…let him be a snack for the crocs….
Wheres the signs?...unfortunately crocs cant read 😂😂😂
One thing I've learnt in life..don't bother trying to look out for people cos noone listens
A floating meat platter, mayswell ring the dinner bell while your at it
thats a women dont you know they are smarter.?  let her be she got it handled.
Let the natural selection take its course 😆
The Aussie doesn’t actually care 😂 he’d be sitting there watching the news going “I told old mate to get out and he didn’t want to listen that’s his own fault” just wanted to say something to say it. smh
When in Australia, just assume every drop of water that isn't a pool is full of death, because it is! Where is this idiot from, I'd love to know.
Argumentation with an Aussi that tell you to have some *common sense* - let the croc and fish teach him...  Warnings don't work here at all.
Darwin selection.
Australian quarrels are the most entertaining
There is some absolute F....K W...TS in this world.
Let him be eaten. The crocs need to eat stupidity. 😂
This guy must not understand how a croc kills its prey..
Let him get eaten
Listen to the Aussie. They know what they are talking about
Lived in Gove in the NT in the 80s,  not unusual to be tracked by crocs when you walk down the beach, they are a clear and present danger
Darwin award winner.
"I love how dashing men look when they wear blue suits to dinner" - the crocodile
We know how fkn dangerous it is in Oz. Always look at the signs. Crocs take idiot tourists every year, so do sharks and funnel web spiders and let’s not forget the deadliest snakes in the world. When we say dont do it, listen, we mean it
Do Australian crocodiles have accents too?😊
He is even dressed like a 🦭. Looks like croc-food to me
Let him get eaten... I love those stories.
Peter Pan crocodile music begins playing
Let him have his paddle 😂
Let him BE food , nice for crocodiles
That loser is not used to people giving him warmth. Let him chat with the crocs.
Leave him alone. .....natural selection
Tourists are gonna tourist!
exactly how we treat any murky water in Florida. there's definitely a gator in it if you can't see one
don't say anything, it's just natural selection
When God sent you 3 written and 2 spoken signs, and you still ask why did he let the crock eat you.
Propably a tourist
Don't fight with the man you tried your best. If he wants to argue, let him swim off and die.
Fokim, just let him go swimming 😂😂😂
Tap danncing in the minefield
Don't stop him, this is natural selection in action.
Darwin's Law will sort this 😂
Natural selection right there mate!
Wearing a stinger suit against crocs 😂 😂 😂
If an Australian man is telling you to watch for crocs you should definitely watch for crocs!
Another name for a paddle board is 'crocodile chew toy'.
When an idiot is white the face is blurry and when the idiot is non white … there is always a close up with clarity. 🤔
Learn from other peoples mistakes  Best life advice i could give anybody
Shhhhh let darwinism do its thing, this is how society heals itself.
leave him alone
The  usual  suspect
Another one to be taken out of the gene pool😂😂😂
This fool deserves his upcoming Darwin award.
Natural Selection.
just let him do his thing; p
Wanna bet that idiot is not an Aussie?
Must be a Amurikkkan cause they know everything
Natural selection, let Muppet do his thing? 😆👍🇬🇧.
Now thats a level of dumbfuckery - when I go to NQ the only water I go near are pools and showers.  And I still check both
Let him eaten. You cant help stpid! 😊
I definitely don't want to "get done" by a crocodile..👉👌😳😫
This video is essentially natural selection in action
Dumb ways to die
Australian saltwater the largest of the crocodilians.
C'mon, let Darwinism to take its course.
Seriously look at what it's wearing deserves everything 😅😅😅😅
Australians had a Prime Minister who disappeared without a trace in the ocean. So they named a public swimming pool after him.
Crocs love the undereducated
I lived in Aus and always listen to the locals and read the signs they are not trying to stop your fun  but trying to protect you
Where's the sign... THERE'S 3 OF THEM!
Let him🙄
Let people do what they want to do and stop harassing them.
Natural selection at it's finest. I just hope he doesnt have children. Those genes do NOT need to be passed on.
when the Brain is offline its offline... Happy Hour for Crocs
“Even in an emergency situation the Australian accent is hilarious “ - Shane Gilis Probably 😅😂😂😂
Why not let natural selection take its course?
On a knee board dressed as a teletubby . Even the crocs would giggle before lunch is served . 😂
Ok mate, go feed crocodiles
If l was in England (where im from) and someone warned me about crocodiles, id sprint out the water.  Currently im in Taiwan. Bin in the sea😅
Nature's way of saying to this bloke, last chance!!
Crocodile snack.
Not long for this world
Natural selection folks.. let the man be.
Is there a part 2 taking a blue wetsuit out of the water
They outfit ,says it all !
Forget the crocs for a minute, what the f is he wearing and what the f is he doing?
Croc,like Mate,why?, Darwin Award, and me lunch bruhv
🤦🏼‍♀️
Crocs gotta eat too
Omfg listen to the locals, I wanted to take a paddle board across the spit and the locals stopped me from having to paddle all the way back from the sea
I was living in north queensland for tree years , don't go swiming when the water is like this   .
Just let it get a Darwin Award, clean up the gene pool.
Sometimes you have to let natural selection do it’s thing so idiots like this don’t reproduce
What a genius
Let the crocodile have his dinner, he should be removed from the Gene Pool.
He’s a Liberal haha
I’m not bovvered if the idiot on a board gets eaten there are in excess of 8 billion humans on this planet, we can lose the brain dead ..   but the crocs are a lot rarer and it will pay the price for human stupidity
What bell end
Let him have his Darwin moment, the two people did their best to warn him.
Yobo
What a fool
It's time to cull the crocodiles if they have moved that far south now..
It's OK! .... He's in Lycra!👍🥴
the crocs watching in the distant thinking..."ahhh i love tourism season!"...."its party time boys!"....grew up in Darwin...saw the biggest croc in the world....  yeh..there dinosaurs alright..and we monkies to them!...
I don’t see a problem here. Growing up my car manual showed me how to do things like adjust the tappets to get the correct valve clearance on my engine. Now days it tells you not to drink the battery fluid of which to my generation was common sense. We need to bring back selection of the species for the greater good of gene pool for mankind. This man on this paddle board is doing us all a service by making sure only the smartest and strongest survive just as evaluation did for 10s of thousands of years. 😂
Even the crocodiles are posting "that's bait" memes. The F is that guy wearing?
let nature teach the arogant man
I'll start a go fund me for the crocodile 🐊 for legal cost after it teaches this human a lesson
Recently seen sign, just put a sign that says, Please Feed the crocodiles by Swimming Here 😂
The Blueman Group is cracked.
Crocs like 'mate, don't mess with my snacks' 😂
Death-wish man + Hungry croc = Tasty snack
Lunch is served,
Feed the crocs already
Darwin's law. It's gonna regulate the situation.
“Where’s the sign”  *points out 3 signs in the immediate vicinity*  This guy: eh, probably over exaggerating
Zero survival awareness and  skills
It's that new blue Teletubby "Dumb Dumb"
What a Nut case.
That's insane, green infested croc waters and a no common sense swimmer.
Darwin Award in the waiting...
Their quite quick on land short burst of 15km/h, in water 30km/h. Lived in Darwin stay away from murky waters edge.
That guy is definitely a cyclist. 😂
Little known fact, Crocs are scared of smurfs. They're ancient rivals. So this guy's prolly ok 😂😂😂
Helping people is so overrated...
I LIVED IN CAIRNS FROM 2014 TO 2017. NEVR ONCE JUMPED IN THE OCEAN 😂😂 NOT EVEN IN DESIGNATED SWIM AREAS AT TRINITY BEACH 😂😂😂
Idiot 😂😂😂😂😂
He's probably from Melbourne. When I was a teenager in the 1980s I lived in North Queensland for a while, locals treated "Australians" with contempt. - that is folk from Victoria or NSW.
When he heard there was a crock in the water, he probably thought someone lost their shoe.
NO WORRIES MATE! The wet suit is croc-proof...
Natural selection
Natural Selection...
I really need to know if this bloke survived 😂 I bet he was working on the liberal assumption if I don’t bother them they won’t bother me 🤦‍♂️
Another brainless tourist
Don't interfere with evolution and natural selection
When an Aussie stops joking around and turns serious. That's when you need to be listening.
Some people just cannot be told and think they know best
Probably has a single mother - you can do anything my boy.
Must be Steve Irwins dad?
It’s ok he plans to tell the crocodile he identifies as an idiot
This is natures way of culling. Let the croc have his dinner.😂😂😂
Ah yes. This is one of those disappearing tourists we keep hearing about.
I wonder if his name is Wayne Kerr Chomp.
Idiot  dressed for a quick croc snack 。。determined isn’t he !
stop talking at him and let Darwin work his magic !
Let the crocodiles have their fun
Let him get eaten....
ulgy americans lol
I wouldn't even swim in an indoor swimming pool in Australia
Warned now if he dies he dies Ivan drago style
Tiger sharks great whites bull sharks crocodiles take your pick mate it’s all a horrendous death
Well said mate
Don't stop him. Otherwise, he will continue to pollute the gene pool.
Bro is trying to free palestine with his burkini
We don’t want you to die   Ok, I’m choosing to.   Alright!
Australian equivalent of Americans warning tourists not to pet the f*cking bison in Yellowstone
Where the follow-up croc attack video ? Asking for a mate.
Ffs just let the idiot get eaten
Someone like that truly just leave him
Komm schon Mate, die Krokodile müssen auch leben...
Its too cruel to deny the crocs of a tasty lunch 😋🍴
Some people can't wait to BE lunch. Well, off you go! Your choice.
Stop being a idiot  You can retire with the right footage mate let nature take its course 😂 Just keep filming
Darwin Award
When us Aussie say " this is dangerous" believe me  , its dangerous!!!! We don't scare easily 😂😂😂
Sadly far too many tourists simply can't believe that Australia can be a dangerous place. We know what not to do. They don't. :(
If the locals wouldn't do it, don't do it.
At least he in the high visibility body recover suit. If there is anything left
Smurfs have no survival instinct.
Where’s part two when the croc eats him, I wanna see that😂😂😂😂 one less dumbarse in the gene pool
Lets watch him paddle with no arms.....
I spotted the crocs about halfway through...
Self preservation isnt always real. Sometimes you find people like this smurf
Don't argue with these people. Let nature do its thing.
Definitely a  Victorian 😂
It's called natural selection...
What a drongo
Yeah nah, just leave him. Then we don't have to feed the crop for a couple of days
Just stay shut up and keep the camera rolling 😅
Leftie be like... im smarter than you Right wingers... you know nothing. Stop oppressing me. Where's the equality 😂
If someone native to the area tells you it's a bad idea, you should probably listen 💯
I used to live in Cairns. I got yelled at by an Aussie for fishing in a boat that was too small to protect against crocs. I listened right away and went to the pier. I probably fished on this very pier.
Mother Nature does the selecting🤫
Leave the smurf alone, crocodiles have gotta eat too!!
Never argue with a fool. Especially someone whose seems hellbent on becoming a crocodile's snack.
Just leave him to get eaten
Let him go mate.. we have ENOUGH idiots. We can spare a few.
This dude ringing his own dinner bell i just know when on land he still wears a covid mask and calls people nazis who dont agree with him.
Stop ruining the crocodile lunch!
He has a crocodile safety suit amdvthat board will get him out of danger quick
Later that day, the crocodiles had a great feast! The whole family was there! ❤
Tell me that you're from Melbourne without telling me that you're from Melbourne
What a plank
Why care just let natural selection take its course
Darwin rules ok !.
😂😂😂😂
My kids were born in Cairns. We moved to Melbourne to area with lakes took them months before they believed us that there werent any crocodiles in the lakes. This guy is a nit wit.
Let him be mate it's natural selection in action
Sushi
We have a large python living in our garage, which eats the rats that otherwise chew the wiring of the car. When walking through the garden we watch out for brown snakes. We have occasional sharks at our local surfing beaches. We have huge spiders in and around the house (Huntsmen), which we leave alone. Large bats visit our fruit trees in the summer. None of them is a big deal. BUT (and it’s a big but) we will not swim in creeks in N Queensland, because of ‘salties’ (saltwater crocodiles).
𝑯𝒐𝒑𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒊𝒅𝒊𝒐𝒕 𝒊𝒔𝒏𝒕 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒏𝒛🤦‍♀️𝒇𝒇𝒔
What a F#$%^&* W@#$%^!
Dudes in a smurf suit leave him be
imagine one came and chomped him ........ lol
Dude its Australia , basically a big safari where you have 1000 ways how to die exotically !😂
Democrats are everywhere 🤣
That's gratitude for trying to keep you breathing.  🙄.
You know, 20-30+ years ago, when common sense failed, a strangers concern prevailed. And it always ended on good terms without the need for one's ego to take over.  Nowadays, I don't say anything anymore because everyone knows better.  I just sit back and watch.
Maybe strengthen the gene pool by not warning people
Please just have a swim you FOOL. Your last one!
He was warned,just get a good shot of the Croc eating an idiot
Ha ha I’m from Cairns , they close the beaches when crocs come in the wet when the crocs visit , palm cove one in particular just floating off shore waiting for some idiot like this one on his boogy board…..
*THIS IS WHY WE HAVE DROP BEARS!*
Darwinism at work! It's called that for a reason mate!
He was conducting an experiment. 😅
That Surfing Smurf is Croc meat 🐊🥩🤪
Hes wearing that idiotic full blue suit looking like a tasty fish 🐟
This is the problem with the world. To many good people interfering with Darwins laws.
Typical victim
Some of gotta' die , so the rest of us can live .  Thanks to this old fella volunteering his space in this world for another . 🫤
Fkn do-gooder with his camera making a hero out of himself and wanting to show off to the internet about how he told off some idiot in the water.... if he wasn't recording it for his own ego he probably wouldn't have even bothered saying anything to the guy... mind your own business doodle head
I would just sit back and watch natural selection in all it's glory.
Nah bro just congratulate him for the Darwin award
Let the old bloke learn the hard way. What an absolute spoon!!!
I wish my food was that determined to get to me
You gotta be fair dinkum insane to go into any body of water in Oz, Just a reminder, Australia is the ONLY nation in the world to have LOST a Prime minister because he went swimming and his body was never recovered, enter aussie waters at your own risk
Let Darwin do his job.
Dabadee daba Die
You just can't educate fuckwits 😂😂
Leave him alone he's trying for a Darwin
When a local warns you and you don't listen..what happens next is on you and you alone...idiot.
You obviously care more about his safety than he does. Let him learn in his way, which is the hard way apparently.
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣
Dude was pale enough to get burned by the moon and wearing a full UV suit…… let the croc take him
Yo this is no joke! I genuinely lost count of the number of tourists that ended up as headlines because they acted like this guy and ignored locals warnings. Trust the Far North Queensland locals they absolutely know where the crocs are 👍
It would actually be quite nice to see an AI follow-up with a croc getting its dinner
Well I seen it all now he is definitely dinner listen to tbe locals tbey know the waters better than us I carnt understand people like that they have a death wish
Why say anything? just let the man enjoy a death spin
He's probably standing around with a protest sign when he's not being a goofball on the water. I say let him swim, crocks are people too.
If an Aussie is telling you you're in danger from an animal it's probably best you immediately get out
Where's part 2 with the 🐊 🐊 s
I've heard saltwater crocs eat brainless tourists quite regularly.
Stop interfering with natural selection. The dummies NEED to die off before they run the joint
Stop interfering with natural selection. The dummies NEED to die off before they run the joint
Dropbears are dangerous, but Crocs are on another level.😮
Meals on wheels.
Croc is calling out to him hurry up & set up the table for our lunch 🥗
The guy filming is on a SUP board himself
Ive dressed in blue,  so the Crocs dont recognise me. 😂😂😂
Mate...We Wont Miss One Idiot Tourist.Crocs Have Gotta Eat Too.
Hes not Aussies/ howz the fuking outfit😂😂
If he didn’t see the sign, that’s one thing, but if he blatantly ignored it, let Darwin’s Theory take its natural course.
We have the worst of the worst. From spiders and snakes through to White Pointers (you call 'em "Great Whites). So LISTEN when an Aussie tells you how to stay alive!!!
You just too the croc's dinner away from him
Austraulians apparently haven’t learned what natural selection is. 😂 just shut up, sit back, and enjoy the show like Americans 😂
Maybe homie wants to be eaten, did you think of that?
Crocs count on ignorance so that their species survives and thrives. Written by someone who lives in FNQ.
Natural selection, let him swim.
Darwin wasn't wrong ....
Let the natural selection do its work.
Love the fact he's got a stinger suit on .. but no common sense to protect him from being eaten to death😂😂😂
To be fair I think the croc should be more concerned of a wild aussie
A case of natural selection! 😂😂😂
No ears equals chop🤣
Let the crocodiles feed don't bother rescuing him
It's not survival of the fittest, it's survival of the smartest
~"it just water puppy" 😂 said the western people 😂
Natural selection.
That kind of deranged attitude has very close parallels to the Democrats here in the United States.
That Brave dude wants to be Croc Poo 😞
Good man to tell him but after the go ahead mate I would’ve sat and watched…
This is God's way of thinning the herd. Leave him be. The problem will take care of itself.
Natural attrition
He said thank you the wrong way
We need part 2, man in blue suit bitten. 😂
What a dumb......C U Next Time 🤣
Just let em b. He is playing with his own life. Clearly doesnt care.
I'm not as good o' a person as this guy. I woulda stayed and filmed it after the snotty mouth on this guy.
Don't interrupt natural selection.
Natural selection at its finest
When people are too arrogant to listen to good advice, let it be, no point talking sense to these type of people
And that’s the last they ever saw of the wannabe blue man
Old mate probably thinks his paddleboard will save him. Crocs up here have been known to smash into tinnys to make them tip 😂
You never swim in NQ waters without making sure no crocs are around. Even then i still wouldnt get into any murky water.
This dude out here acting like croc bait "Let me do my thing" 😂😂
Croc bait.
Yeah don’t blame the crocodile because there wouldn’t be anything left of you 🙄🤌🤌
Natural selection 😂
If you ever see an Aussie running up the road there is imminent danger coming that way.
As an australian i can confirm if you wont die, we dont care what you do, its your life.   If its life thretening we will throw you a warning and still, your life, your choice.... we did warn you for a reason.
That’s true Florida man behavior 😹☠️
Do not warn people, let them suffer from their stupidity.
Haha no common sense
I agree with being cautious and not promoting to swim with crocodiles, however unknowingly my son and I did. In Lombok bay we never heard let alone seen crocodile for years . This time it was 6m salty right next to "surfers paradise" for around 3 weeks. To my surprise no incidence whatsoever. 😮 I warned the surfers, they went out of the water, but next day as if it did not happen 😢. The locals said if you don't budder them they dont budder you and went for business a usual.😮
let him go, Darwin will look after him 😂
I would let the guy go, some people learn through lunch
One there one there and one over there😂. As a territorian I gotta say crocs gotta eat.
Nothing like a know-it-all who's getting ready to die
how do you know there's crocs in the water? All you gotta do is reach down and touch the water. Is it wet? then there's crocs there. 😂
Natural selection 🎉
Some people you just don't help.
This isn’t real life
Crocs : leave the man alone you karen. i will make sure this man safe and silent
My grandma had a saying about hardheaded folks: “The burned child shuns the fire.”
Just let him become their Brunch meal 😂
Should have stayed silent. There are far too many American tourists in Australia.
Shut up mate your scaring of my dinner! What an idiot this guy discussing while the dude is saving his life. Dude should let darvinian laws take charge
Who cares leave him alone y did u record this and post it gosh mind ur business and the loud nosey lady in the background kiaora from NZ LOL
One born every minute...😂
Gotta be a lefty
An aussie would already know this...this guy is just a blithering idiot..
I hope he was eaten and the guy was there saying you still fully aware mate?
Some people are never wrong! If you learn to listen, you get smart!
Not listening to an Aussie IN Australia is a different level of insanity.
He got a croc proof wet suit on he will be fine hes safe and he knows it otherwise he wouldnt be splashing like that😅
Australia has so many deadly things, most of them will run away and you won't even see them in a lifetime in the country. But when it comes to crocs I will always take it really seriously.
crocs view on boat ramps, like dogs waiting for falling food from the kitchen counter.
Should have let him go; would make a good video, seeing the croc doing it’s death roll as it rips him apart. Is Darwin’s theory at work 😏
Plus the 2 crocs on m'feet mate!!
Never offer help, let evolution take it's course the gene pool will be better off
PLEASE we need to allow some people to ,,,,,, leave the world
Crocodiles -  Cleaning up the Gene POOL, SINCE 50 MILLION  B.C. !
🐊: Why don't you shut up mate.... let him do his thing
So there’s fools all over the world… I see🤔🤬  let the crocodile have dinner mate!!
Crocs are like "oi oi mate hes fine with us ok just mind ya bussiness"
We live in a world where nobody wants anyone to tell them what to do! Even if it’s to save their life!  I have heard it probably a hundred times. No body is telling me what to do! The Bible says that a person that will not receive instruction, is a fool!
Steer clear of water in Australia! He thinks he's in Blackpool! 😅
"There are Crocs that hang by the boat ramp, and they hang around, waiting for fish."  She should have finished the sentence with, and now they are waiting for you.
Saltwater crocs get you even if they’re not hungry & save you for later. That’s a dinosaur. Don’t play with dinosaurs.
I like his head to  toe wetsuit protecting him from sunburn 😂😂😂
Crocs have the same manners as raptors
Who cares.  Let him get eaten..  🤷🏻
Leave the idiot get eaten
Darwin award winner !
If you told an African this, and he was in a bathtub with clear water in someone else's house, he's still getting out before asking questions.
If an Aussie isn’t playing there I’m not either.
Papa Smurf being on the 🍄 !
😂😂
Such ignorant people i see this in Canada lots with bears and moose lol retards
Australian's love hurting themselves but usually draw the line at being killed, usually.
Oh he's still going to blame
Yeah right o 😂😂😂😂 beats ending up as salty 💩
Let people be eaten. That's their problem. Not yours.
Let him go brother. Darwinism
In all fairness I don’t think anyone has ever complained after being done by a wild croc
his part of the Blue Man Group 😂😅
u are in australia* correction .. have some common sense
Why bother? The Croc could use a free meal
Dressed like a seal 🤣😂
He's not telling him not to, he's telling him he's an imbecile 😂
I love Darwin.  Best of luck.
He's Ausrtralian, none of them have a brain bahahaaha
Jokes on all of us. Camera man was wearing crocs
you Sir are a top bloke for telling that numpty about the crocks but I say let common sense take over if he wants to get eaten then good riddance to him just don't put it in the news saying that there was a savage crock attack muppits I tell you
Just look for those little bumps on top of the water!! Your f ....g   clown
Rooting for the crocodile.
Just tell him to keep padding and slashing around. You can sell his paddle board if there’s anything left.. what ding a ling.
If you get eaten by a croc while doing a hobby you love, you have my respect. Well done, good for you. But no sympathy whatsoever 'cause you're an idiot
Crocs : "Don't listen to him mate!"  "You're doing fine!"
After he said he wanted to do what he wanted, I’d have said “right-o you phuken happy meal”
Should have said Great White, he'd be out of there pretty quick.
Nah let him go, probably from Melbourne
Dumb foreigners! Let the crocs have at em!, bet the crocs are hating on the good samaritan 😂
Ong he's getting an attitude with someone trying to save his life!!!
If a local gives you advice you better listen
No I lived there ,he is not near crocs, he has a stinger suit on to protect him for jellies and this guy is using this to get likes ,shame on you
Tourists make the best meals EVER!😋🐊
Lefty
Croc: Shut up mate! I dont come to your house and disturb while preparing for a meal
Natural selection
You know he’s just an idiot when he said ‘where’s the signs’
And the blue scuba packaging was easy to open. Yum😮
Crocodile - mate, let me take care of this power ranger, stress less 😂😂
Crocodiles have their own Bill Of Rights "Let nature take its course,  Any human who ignore the warnings are Fare Gaim, This ain't swimming with the Sharks.."
O Boy. Don't take lunch away from crocky.
People do this in the nt as well. Just happy idiots in their little bubble
This all could hav been avoided with 1 5 second look in any reflective surface
Liberal be eaten.
If you are used to gators, Australian saltwater crocs are next level, I would be a bit nervous swimming with gators, but salties, there is no freaking way I would be in the water, that guy is an idiot
Morons will keep backing up there own stupidity.
He doesnt want to go home to the wife...her mother and sister are there, so  floating with no paddle in croc infested waters is a safe option...and welcome exit if need be😊
Fools will never listen to common sense,  no mercy,bye bye we told you so
He was dressed up as crocodile bite.
He now has one arm and paddles around in circles 😂
*Always* listen if there is 'Go do what you wanna do, but...' 😅
Only three things I fear living in Queensland. Crocs, box jellies, and magpies. But you can always strike up a deal with the magpies, for 'protection' of course.
You shouldn't have told him as it's natures way of improving the gene pool
What an idiot. Fk it, you warned him.
It's crazy to think what chance of living this guy was at during this. Like this has to be tipping the balance beyond 50/50
Ignoring well meaning and qualified local safety advice never did me any ha
This is why I just avoid Australia all together. Dont walk there, dont swim there, dont sit there, dont breathe there, just DONT EXIST IN AUSTRALIA!
All this while wearing Crocs 😂
All that splashing if a croc is close your dinner
Gotta be a liberal 😂
This paddle boarder is definitely wanting a close encounter with your crocs! Must have a d€@th wish!
As an Englishman who's never been to Australia,  if I was there on holiday and a local was telling me to get out of the water I'd be straight out 😂
Some deserve to donate their bodies to wildlife.
Can’t a man get eaten by crocodiles without being heckled?
Sense isn't common
Never bother idiots doing idiot things. Let natural selection take care of things.
Nice platter of tucker for elvis and his friends😅😅. Doordash meal😅
No thats a crocodile recently fking seen sign 😂😂
What's with the blue suite lol
Basic liberal imbecile
Natural selection
Just let him get eaten would be hella fun to watch 😅
Yeah. Prroblem is its us that got go out to pick up the peices, thats if it dont take you to its hidey hole for later, either way your dead already. Only risking the locals  lives trying to drag your carcass out.   What a fool.😮
Classic libtard
Bait
I don't think this picture will ever leave my mind for crystal clear stupidity.
You have to cull the herd of idiots
Are seriously serious dumb
Let me do my thing, like.. get eaten alive and then get stuffed under a tree branch to rot for seconds because i don't like being told what to do even when it saves my life.
"Let there be a thousand blossoms bloom, as far as I am concerned, But I ain't spending any time on it!, because in the meantime, every three months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in north Queensland."
He's obviously  related  to Steve  Irwin
When I was in Darwin, I went to swim in the man made beach early in the morning as it was already 35°. I was alone and went to lay on my towel, then a truck came and 3 men with a massive net removed one massive salt water croc and one small juvenile!! Realized after that there was a sign with swimming hours ! Those guys come every morning to empty the pond first !! 😑
Don't blame the croc......😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dumb idiot
American- f*** around and find out. Aussies- aye mate, theres a croc seen recently
I bet his name is Darwin for some reason.
Survival of the fittest
Clearly a clown dressed as a smurf.
Righto
Let the guy have his Darwin award, come on !!
There's more than 8 billion people on earth, we don't need to waste time on idiots.  Let nature take it's course.
Uber eats:  now the food comes to you.
Crocodile: My ubereats came to my jaw man. 😂
You can lead a horse to water...
Any further video of what happened?
Natural Selection if I ever saw it.. 😂😂
Go the croc
Fock wit
probably a liberal, let him get eaten
Dummmmmmmb ways to die. 🔵🐊
Someone is about the become the main course on a crocodile's dinner table.
The twisted sisters will get him
I do this everyday finally i was told " let them fail"
He must be one of those freehand rock climbers 😅
Natural selection at work
Dying in that outfit would be even more embarrassing
Common sense is not so common anymore. They should call it uncommon sense.
Someone could tell me a crocodile was seen 10 miles away and my body would instantly teleport out of the water
Lol an Australian tells you your being crazy is nuts. As already said.   Where's the signs
im from uk , never been to australia i wouldnt get in that water with or without signs lol
I put up sings in Arabic that say, "Safe to swim here!"
His attitude changed when the 3 signs were pointed out, props for not backing down, he was in his own world.
You cannot beat local knowledge
If the water is wet, there are crocodiles in there….
O, just keep quiet for now and keep your phone in your hand for a much better video to come😂💀🦎😂
where the croc? it is north queensland, they are everywhere, some even rent property
Let him go, raise the IQ for the whole planet 😊
You tried bro, just let natural selection  happen....
The worst part of all of this? Paddle boards and splashing are like the number one way to trigger prey instinct in crocodiles. Staying in the water, minimum splashing and staring the crocs down is how you make yourself look like a tough meal. Like all animals, crocs conserve their energy as much as possible, if they remotely think you’re another predatory, unless they’re starving they will not attack you. The juice ain’t worth the squeeze type of thing
Mind your business aussi
If some Aussie says you something about crocodile in the water you should listen them
Let nature take its course 👍
For once I was hoping to see a fella get eating by a 🐊 on camera. I'm very disappointed
Says the man wearing CROCS. Good on ya, mate. Have a Powers for me. I miss Surfers and Berligh Heads.
All I know in Australia is that everything is dangerous. On land and in the water😅 they aren't just dangerous, they are ranked top 5 or top 10 most dangerous creatures in the world 😅
I grew up in England and knew not to swim in the ocean if the water was warm - too many Portuguese Men of war jelly fish. Swim in the pool not in the sea.
Maybe he wants to go out by crocodile death. Let him do his thing and watch the show lol
I think a bloke called Darwin had a theory about these people!
Getting done by it 😅
If an Aussie tells you it's a good idea, do your research, and make sure. If an Aussie tell you it's a bad idea?   Get the F out of the water.
Been a while since I got to see a good shark attack death. Say nothing, record everything
Let him enjoy his LAST paddle
Yeah, get some self-preservation, dude. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Dudes a floating dinnerplate😮
Get him out of the gene pool before he has kids ffs
Mind you're own business
I will always listen to an Aussie about how to stay safe from the local wildlife.
Ayaw lai
So many crocs hes wearing some
If actually laugh my head off as he screams for help while getting death rolled into the deep, blood red abyss.
Arguing with people trying to help you. I bet he supports illegal immigration
About 8 years ago I was backpacking in Australia. I ended up in an extremely remote location in the Daintree Rainforest called Cape Tribulation.   This place was so remote that the place I was working at was running off of their own generator as there was no electricity grid installed on the island. Everywhere you would look there were signs saying to stay out of the salt-water crocodile infested waters- you couldn’t miss them there were so many.   One evening, a bunch of us went to the beach to have a fire, play some music and watch a meteor shower. It was absolutely beautiful. The next day a bunch of crocodile hunters (rangers) showed up at our remote resort and we discovered that approximately 10 minutes walk down the road two ladies went night swimming in these waters for their adrenaline fix. One lady felt something brush past her leg, and the next minute her friend was pulled underwater and never seen again.   The crocodile was found with her remains still inside the belly. It was killed because of their selfish decision to go swimming at 11pm in the most crocodile infested waters in Australia.   For anyone wondering, they need to find the crocodile that killed the human because they get a taste for them and actively hunt humans afterwards!  Edit: the lady’s name was ‘Cindy Waldron’
Crocs: Come on, Karen. Let him be.
has a death wish
I understand your compassion, but sometimes you just gotta let them find out
Human stupidity doesn't know limits 😅
One of the most polite Australian conversations ever documented
Strewth cobber..You've got to love the ild aussies haven't you. 😊   Greetings from your English friends 🇬🇧
What an idiot Splashing like a lure !!
Hey, crocodiles have to eat too 😂
Leve him be Darwin will sort him out lol
Why would anybody go paddling in open water with Crocodiles? I wouldn't even dip my big toe in that water 😂 Sometimes, you just have to allow Darwinism to occur, less idiots in the gene pool after the Crocodiles eat their next meal.
Natural selection
Useful idiots are everywhere, they all lack common sense.
Wouldn’t waste my breath on him man
Crocodile:you should listen to the Australian mate they're professional at their job
Let him be bait since he’s very stubborn
Off topic I was skateboarding did a dangerous kick flip over a 10 foot wall than I hear a nasty Scottish accent that I couldn't understand but he was yelling I stopped before the jump and it  was dog at the bottom I didn't understand what that man said but I understood to stop and look i guessed he was a tourist obviously
I let natural selection run its course whenever possible. Lol!!
Imagine dying in such a ridiculous suit
Bluey must be a leftie. Thick as f.
Wife used to encourage me to swim Plenty of saltwater crocs
ya think the crocodile gives a flying F about a sign bro? your splashing around in crocodile infested waters like a dying seal. best of luck bro. thanks darwin. 😅😂
Just let the idiots get killed, it will improve life for the rest of us.
I did this exact thing when i was in NQ 😅
I backpacked Australia for 6 months when I was younger. I never got into the water unless you I saw locals doing it.
Natural selection
I have that discussion regularly with my husband on giving advice to friends and family, he usually goes "no you have to explain it to them again, it's important they don't make that mistake and ..." and I say "no, just no, I say it once. They're all adults, if they don't want to hear it, their decision"
Crock bait. I'd not bother the idiot. But keep filming and your video will sell well.
Is there an update on whether the smurf is still alive or otherwise?
Croc was looking forward to his Sydney Sub 😂
Ya. Just let it all "play out" like mother nature intended. Thats the problem with this world, to many idiots "allowed" to survive. Now, they are anchors to society.
Darwin was right, why help these morons? They are just weakening the gene pool
That guy needs to go back and watch Jaws again it’s apparently been too long🤔
Buddy thinks crocs and gators are the same…
"you do you and let me do my thing" no problem with that dude, but in the case you get attacked, the city's gonna have to rescue you (or what's left of you), putting in risk other people and wasting tax money
Dont warn those stvpids, just let them be food for the animals, ..at least they do someting meaningful in life 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤡
Survival skills of a liberal
@bandit_six5418 Really appreciate your tip !
Just let him mate ! One less to steal the oxygen !😂
I don't care where you are. If a local who isn't crazy gives you safety advice, take it!
Let him die if he don't care why you should we have to care about him he knows there is crocodiles he saw the sign me a person like me I will ignore this fools and let them die
Dude's a Democrat he won't listen to reality and truth.Let him find out the hard will do all of us a favor
Splash the water tell him he’s right. Drive away
Saved a life probably
Let the crocs eat bro
let the guy feed the crocs if thats what he wants to do
Bloke: “Let me do my thing”  Croc: “Yeah mate, leave my food alone!”
And when someone is attacked and eaten, authorities have to go around killing crocs until they find the culprit.
Im blue dabadeedabadij if im green I would die😂
Don’t be so pissy let Darwin do his work
Darwin Award nominee
Ozzyman real life 😂
‘Where’s the sign’ proceeds to point out 3 signs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Some people are just unbelievable
-Dude, just let me be will you? -I'm trying to mate, i'm trying!
Natural selection.
I'm sure the big ones hang out at the boat ramps too
Geez, he’s just trying to help him not die I would not have argued with him. I would’ve just warned him that he’s stpd.
It reminds me of growing up in the eighties. Go ahead buddy. As the smart ones laughed. Only the strong survive. Knowledge is key. Have respect and know your surroundings for sure.
Comparison: Conservatives have been trying to tell liberals and democrats for years that socialism doesn't work. Yet they keep swimming the water. "The water's fine, come on in!"
Let nature take its course. One less idiot in the world
Calm down …. his blue skin suit is enough to deter anything
Let the man be
Should have stopped after warning him once
Come on guys be had a full length stinger suit on
Old people literally can't hack being told what to do and being told there wrong and it's funny af, okay die then
If he's arguing after the first warning just ask him for the next of kin to contact to make it easier for them.
"where's the sign??"... maybe it's for the best if he's removed from the gene pool.
I think the most reasonable response to "Have you seen the 'crocodile recently seen' signs?" is "Oops, I'll get out of the water now."
It's just the evolutionary process working as it should. I don't see a problem?
If only we had salt water crocs in the Uk 👌
I wouldn't have said anything too that idiot.  I fact you should encourage him to splash around while you chum the water.
"Yeah righto" after the missus joins in 😂😂
The head to toe outfit is a dead giveaway matey had no business being there in the first place 😂
Nono. Should've let the crocs had him. Filter his inferior genetics out of the gene pool.
These lefties are unbelievable!
This perfectly symbolizes today’s world
Let natural selection take over... Good educational video to be made 😅
He's American???
Why is this reminding me of all the times we warned people not to vote for Trump. But here we are… We told you so.🤷🏻‍♀️😒
Today’s top story… Have you seen this missing man?last seen at the beach In an unrelated story a croc hunter caught a salty with a blue wet suit inside him…🤔🤔 More on this and more at 11:00 🐊🐊
Dude is a Kamala / Mamdani supporter 100%
After 1 warning, I’d just get a tub of popcorn and watch him get torn in half 😂
Crocs: „Don’t be a croc block. Let us have him.“
The fact that these boards are called "shark biscuit" in Australia says it all...
The second he started to be rude I would have just stopped and let him do what he likes, I mean I wouldn't wish harm, but I wouldn't give a toss if something happened...
‘Darwin Award’ contender
Just let him dissappear.
Nibblers mate, they eat stuff
Oi sassy
I have grown tired of caring, let the crocs eat him
Must be from Melbourne
Fuckwits everywhere.
W Karen moment tbh
Darwinism should be allowed to play out. It helps human evolution.
Natural Deselection
If Aussies are warning you .... THEY KNOW 😂 Go ahead mate 🤣🤣🤣🫣 Just for the paramedics, in case ya still alive,  What's ya blood group mate 😂
Darwin Award nominee 🏆
Anther Monday in Australia i would throw some fish near him
Just let Darwinism do it's thing.
A guy in crocs warning about crocs 😂
Thats like going to a Florida swamp, and taking a dip with the crocs.
Please dont interrupt the crocodile feeding time !😂😂😂
Imagine the embarrassment of dying in a blue gimp suit.😂
Survival of the fittest? Croc probably killing himself laughing at the surface.
He’s fine loll
Fckin sickos livin over there
Don't mind him he's just a Blueberry snack 😂
😂😂😂😂
..death by misadventure. Bonza mate, fucken people ! Go the locals :-D
Croc listening to this wanting to eat the snitch on his uber eats drop
Don't waste your time on him. You gave him sound advice, time for the crocs to take over.
Local gives you a warming "where is the sign" ... okay mate be crock lunch! No loss there
Ocean cyclist
He has to be Russian
Let go he’s prolly from NSW
In a foreign land, you have to admit your ignorance and adapt.
Not bro wearing crocs
Close to Darwin...pun intended
Crocs love blue umbongos
The Darwin Awards top contender!🎉
"Where's the sign?" He disregards "common sense" and places responsibility for his own life on a sign.
One warning is all an adult man should get. Let nature do the rest.
A lot of the southerners coming up north for cheaper real estate and less machete crime have no idea either 😂😂😂😂😂😂🙀
Leave the poor guy alone! Crocodiles need to eat too
queensland i remember
Natural selection at its finest !
Yep just don't blame the crock.  😂  Wonder if he got snacked on .gees
Hey mate, crocs gotta eat too
As a crocodile I approve what this guy is doing!
The crocs are always watching
Fxxk is that teletubby going.😮😅
When an aussie tells you it’s not a good idea, you dang well listen to that!
When you're ignorant of how dumb you actually are 🫩.
Should of just let him go out, FK him
its Australia duh o viously no brai s my sister lives in North Queensland
Where's the sign? The audacity of this guy is off the chart.
Down south mob
Legend has it that even though he was told not to blame the crocodile, he did so….
Full wet suit though 😂 croc will think he’s a seal 🦭
“Where’s the sign” at that point just let him die.
😂😂😂😂😂
Friendly locals.
Crocodile: "looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"
That’s where stupidly stubborn will take you. If that was me and I genuinely didn’t know and 2 people are telling me there’s crocodiles in there that would have got out of there so fast and shook that man’s hand
It seemed like he wanted to get eaten.
Who else was waiting for the live action ?
Btw it's not just any croc. Slat water Crocs are beasts
just let it happen, you told him and he clearly doesnt understand
He's like "ohhh cmon stop being annoying"  😅
The issue is; your thing, when it goes wrong, will leave me with severe PTSD mate.
How did it work out for him?
Natural selection at work here folks
I would’ve just watched him get eaten f that guy
Let it happen nature will make it aaallll better
Is that a German lol
The next Darwin award recipient lol
You can't help idiots
I think i would listen to the locals in an area. They telling you this for a reason. Idiot.
Yeah go ahead mate and find out!!
Don't waste your breath. These are the same clowns that head inland to explore the great Aussie outback with one spare wheel and two bottles of water, expecting phone reception and service stations everywhere to get their "gas"😅
Some folk just think the warnings don't apply to them 😂😂
Lunch 🐊
Come onnn...crocs gotta eat too 🐊
Your honor, I did what I could without increasing danger to more people. Understood, we will chalk it up to sucide by stupidity.
I have a  brother like this and we can't take him anywhere😂😂😂
I‘m a American i can Go everywere i‘m Freeman USA can do what they want also Swimming with crocodile
Straight off PnO that bloke
Leave that man alone,i mean does the crocodile 🐊 not deserve a little snack and it's already on a white plate😂😂😂
I thought that was a space alien
CROCODILE: Hey dude! let him be!
Il shut my mouth but camera still rolling with excitement 😂
You know, I for one think it’s important that genes like these get removed from circulation
Why intervene nature. Let natural selection do its thing...
Brain dead.....then all the way dead
Hahaha that's too funny...
Your in Nth Queensland mate have some common sense. Some people have no common sense.😂😂.
the POV guy ought to have know the padle boating guy had his : " i am CHUM"  Tshirt on & a DAVY Jones Locker tattoo on the guys hamstring
we call old buddy Lunch
Crocs develop special taste for those kind of people
Croc will eat the blue pill and turn it into a red pill 😂
You been warned 💀😁
Leave him alone fearmonger
Come on you crocs.    Come and get him.      He's a waste of space.
If Australians had common sense they wouldnt have allowed salt water crocodiles to get out of hand.
Always one Muppet who thinks the rules do not apply to them ..
Let natrual selection do it's thing man
That boarder is obviously a demoKKKretin... no common sense or attachment to reality
DUDE!!! Do you hear the accent of the guy saying CROC 🐊 THERE! THERE! And on over THERE
Let Darwinism do its thing.
The current Labor government is more dangerous than Salties
I think Darwin wrote a book about this person.....😂
You should always listen to a redneck and an Australian when they're telling you that you're being too dangerous. They know their stuff.
We need to let natural selection happen again
Stop putting warning signs everywhere. Letm learn by experience.
There’s red flags and there’s red flags. An Aussie bloke saying don’t paddle there is the latter.
"where's the sign then???"  "There, there, there, and on all of these ramps"
Let him go and just film it so we can all laugh later
Natural selection
The crocs like a bit of international cuisine
If he want's to be a dinner for a croc, let him.
What a donut 🍩  😅  some people 😮
natural selection is hard to watch.....
The crocs name is Darwin
You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. Good luck to the dude 🤣🇬🇧
He is suicidal..he doesn't care
Dumb
THE SMURF DO BETTER!❤  /Mikael
Natural selection
WHO?????????? Hasn't heard about Australia and everything that kills ya?? THAT DOLT!! Is he a Britt
This fella genuinely cares about the well being of the floating blue smorgasbord..🎉
I'm certain that they don't put up multiple signs just for fun. Pay attention! And listen to the locals who are trying to protect you.
Sometimes idiots die and im ok with that.
Crocs love dim sims
Let him go he's not a child
Buddy.. He Obviously Knows What He’s Doing. Do You Not See The Blue Suit?
I'm Australian, here's my old school advice ( you try and advise people and they'll hate you for it ) don't get involved .
So if I visit North Queenslands I will be sure to pack my common sense.
Crocodile need to have a good snack once in a while ! Dumb people do have a purpose on this Earth !
Struth
Common sense and Australian 2 words not often used together 😅😂😅😂
You done your part mate now just let nature take its course 😉
Always listen to a fkn aussie.. soesh the local. Them people are craziest so if they are worried you fkn better be aswell
I'm Canadian but if I hear a Australian tell me I'm in danger I'm nearly dead 😂
I'm Australian. Some of the comments are gold.
Dude is super available for natural selection.... carry on my guy lol
Just leave the fool to the crocodiles to eat him.
Just leave these people natural selection
Crazy, the salt water crocidiles in Australia are huge.
“Let me do my thing.”  Bro I don’t want to see a man get ripped apart right now lol
When a aussie says no it fkn means it.
Dude just keep the camera rolling. It makes great YouTube and tiktok. You could have gotten a gold mine off this😂😂😂😂
Must be one of those comma lacking "Crocs do not swim here" signs
In that moment what does it matter is there are signs. Someone is telling you you're in croc infested waters. Get out. Idiot.
This is a part of natural selection. 🤷‍♂️ warn ones and then walk away.
i bet you wish you hadn't warned him now
Maybe you shouldn’t say anything. Just grab a tinnie and watch the show. 👍
Just let nature take its corse.  He's obviously a waste of life
Definitely a future Darwin award winner.
Haha what a suicidal idiot. I lived in Australia for a year and the aussie are crazy. If they say: get out the wada mate, thean you get out the water 😅
Let him be! If he wants to be an idiot this planet needs to start getting rid of them
Im a native Texan, and I can unequivocally tell you that if an Ausie came up to me in my own backyard and said "dont go ovuh there mate"...I wouldnt go over wherever "there" is.
Leave him man.
Why blurred the face public shame the bloke ❤
Old mate is lucky this guy cared enough to reason with him. Most of us would just say "nah, I wouldn't be doing that mate" and carry on with our day.
All you can do now is pull up a front row seat to the death spin show 😂
Let him return to Darwin.
His last words "yeah righto"
He looks like he has lived a good long life and is now trying to return back to nature as manure.....crock manure.
Legend has it, the Australian voice you hear is actually a salty released by the late Steve.
Is there a part 2 to this ???
Can't put brains in statues
Natural selection
Don’t blame the crocodile is brilliant.
I love this tbh..Just let them take themselves out. who cares right?
I can tell you now , As an Australian , I would not go for a Dip in the water anywhere North of From the N.S. W    Coastline .
he just wanted to die in peace and you try saving him
When ego takes over common sense
If he insists on winning a Darwin Award, let him have his way. Unlike that guy, the gene pool and the crocs will appreciate your efforts.
You can't help some people ...just sit back and watch
Film the feast
Just let nature do it's thing
"I'm fully aware" in this case is a sign of mental illness or full-blown stupidity.
It's a well known fact, crocs can't see the colour blue 😂
Darwin Awards!
Only messing around with one of the most dangerous animals on earth. Something than can get up to 6m long and weight over a tonne in it's natural habitat is not something to be trifled with. Saltwater crocodiles are no joke, they see you before you're in the water!
common sense isn't that common
Temporary Australian
In Australia you need to be extra careful if you a paddle of water especially those near a small river, there are giant crocodiles lurking around.
instead of trying to convince him,.just troll him saying a croc is gerting closer😂 he will move a little faster then
Leave him be! The crocs gotta eat too
Brother, he is not a Karen; he just doesn't want to see NatGeo Live.
U cannot tell some idiots lol.
Part 2?
Hahaha what a FXCKWIT
QUEENSLANDER!!!
Arguing to get eaten. 😅
It's my right to be eaten by crocodiles. You couldn't make it up.
And he didn't even use the other C word. Very retrained tbh.
If an Aussie in Australia is warning you to get out of the water YOU LISTEN! 🤦
Croadile Yummee, I'm safe because crocs can't read the signs......
Dumb ways to die, so many dumb ways to die.
当你在河里游泳，你爸妈和你说小心时，或许你可以无视。但是当一个澳洲口音的人和你说小心，你最好立刻滚上岸😂😂😂这是普通常识。
Let’s not interfere with any Darwinian efforts to reduce our population numbers…. We can’t really afford to feed him however he will be feed for something else…… Sigh
leave him . free lunch for the croc
Hahaha....if he had any common sense he would be on dry land. Maybe he watches crocodile Dundee too many times.
Young people can't take suggestions, criticism or advice. Let him do his thing. If an Australian tells me not to swim in certain waters, I'm listening.
Just let the crock have lunch.
He had common sense. He was protected from the harsh Aussie sun.
bloodyhell
i started that video over and over for 15 times now. hoping the croc will finally appear for a good meal.
It’s called natural selection. Just sad that the croc will get killed if it eats this dude.
Yah, you know you in real trouble when even the Aussie is telling to get out 🤦 they like to wrestle these things from time to time 😂😂😂
Like a crocodile only eats you if there's a sign 😂😂😂😂
Let him get his booster too and wear a mask in his car.  You can't convince morons they are wrong.
I don't wish harm on anyone, I don't...but I'm on the croc's side now...
This is just nature taking its course.
plenty around Port Douglas
Can we get the part two
Mate can you stop standing in the way of evolution? Evolution is hungry.
Aye mate, why are you up there trying to steal that croc's door dash!?!
Natural selection, enjoy your snack crocs 😂😂
Natural selection at work 🎉
Man's in denial! Hes gonna end as dinner 😂
To those that dont know, its not the fact that the bloke was on the paddleboard but the fact that he was paddling the water with his hands. When you paddle in croc infested water youre only signalling one thing to the croc - that you are prey. We may be the Alpha.. but it doesnt mean we are the only predator.
If he get taken out by croc i would just stand there and laugh .
Just leave him,who cares ,would be no loss to humanity 🎉
Unbelievable jeez.  What was he thinking!!!
Just let the f’n idiot get eaten. There’s signs; if he doesn’t want to obey them that’s his problem.
From OZZ, 😅😂😂yep 😅
Natural selection 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I'm rooting for the crocodile in this instance.
Smeone sang a song about the crocodile roll, I'm sure this guy was in it.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Would have flim the death roll and imagine him going to his ancestors that also die to a crocodile 😂
Natural selection going to happen
Leave the man be we don't need him voting or breeding
Leave him alone he's trying to make the world a little more intelligent one person at a time
after he said that i would have just said “you’re right. don’t mind me recording. When you die someone might buy the video from me.”
This problem will solve itself.
Darwinism at its finest mate
Australian translation: The Choggasnappa gon snip snap your dongle off mate
Throw some chum mate
There is always someone around to spoil the fun. I wanted to see him eaten.
Where's the sign?!  Common sense is all you need.  P*sses me off these people get big crocs and gators k*lled 😔
HAHAHAHAHA facken idiot
Why you filming the dock, and posting😢
Stupidity should be painful
Homie lost all his money in Thailand and has nothing to live for.
Darwin awards.
Australia is the only first world country that is hot all the time. All the other hot countries are third or second world.
North Queensland ain't no joke with crocs either. Saltwater crocs aren't rare and they are NOT small.
North Queenslander here. Have to say his little board thing, his cute blue wet suit ... crocs love these little European aperitive's, small, tasty, and easy to get down.
Sometimes the squirrels just run under your tire like they wanted to.
Where’s the sign. Famous last words of an idiot
People are allowed to risk their own lives.They do it rock climbing.mind your own business karen.
Wow he's really insistent on dieing.
Darwin.
Just let him do his thing. Nosy people.  Maybe he wants to die.
Let me guess, the guy on the board is from Darwin, NT?
There more afraid of you then you are of them.
Darwins LAW....... this fella just want to prove it :-)
Mind your own business. His kids need the inheritance
Jeez to have the audacity to argue with someone who is just looking out for your wellbeing is wild
Natural Selection at its finest!
He be another statistic 🤦🏾
Ignorant old unt. Exactly what is wrong with the world
look man the prehistoric apex predator is nothing to worry about. im on a 4 foot paddleboard. nothing to worry about
I thought he was a WHOVILLE character
Crocodiles love tourists.
Remove all warning labels.The problem will work itself out.
Qlder here - you can tell those aren’t from Qld 🤣
The Darwin Award is strong in this one.
Croc's can't read, no need to look for them they'ill find you....have a good day mate.
If he’s dressed in blue let him swim.
Idiots learn by incident.
If an Aussie is telling you ' it's a bad idea'- it is probably A BAD IDEA 🤨
Let that man get his Darwin Award 😂😂😂
What a croc-blocker!
Why do you want to deprive the crocs of their meal for the day?  That is animal cruelty.
He has his crocodile proof wetsuit and wants to catch a wave!
Let nature take its course!
Natural selection
I say remove all the warning signs at let Darwin sort it out.
I’m blue
25 million people in Australia and none of them, apart from this guy, are swimming at that boat ramp. Might be something to that. At least he’s got a stinger suit on.
Not that many crocs in qld
He sounds like a pom
He fully aware best believe so was them Crocs
Natural selection in real time
It's called natural selection
Even though it's better in the long run to let natural selection take care of it, due to medicare we'd all have to pay for the emergency response and coroner so have a civic duty to try to avoid the cost
Typical voter in the US, on both sides!
Just gotta let dumb mfers like this get hurt and die
See ya
Testing the waters of natural selection…
The guy looks like food with that suit on
Just let the Telly Tubby swim with the Crocs in peace!
You’re in Australia, mate. Even a puddle of water is dangerous out there
Maybe nature is just showing that the blue smurf's genetics ran down their course, and there should be less of his kind?
Croc: Leave my food alone!
Don't tell the idiot just keep the camera rolling.  Him getting death rolled will be good footage
At this, you let natural selection take over and let nature get rid of vermins. Talk about self entitlement, crocs need put up a sign if this no-wits goes swimming in a crocodile waters.
Natural selection at work
"Don't blame the croc when you get done by"  What a legend!!
Let him get his Darwin Award. He deserves it.
The croc to the people behind the camera 🐊🖕🏻
If an Aussie is warning me of danger in their country I’m listening
Croc bait 😂😂 natural selections at work. Let him go
"...Common sense?? i have nothing to give you, mate. " says the idiot.
I don’t know why people care about what other people do with their time, especially if it only harms them and not us. 🎉
Austrailian are awesome!
Mate!  The Darwin principle is in full swing.
This fool is clearly not Aussie. Paddling in croc infested waters......hello breakfast.😂🐊
Good place for a potential Darwin award.  Probably what the man is hoping for😅
Aussies are some of the most fearless people  ever known. So if he's scared, Im more scared..😳
That guy is foolish not to take this advice seriously.
What a weapon
😂 what a half avocado 🥑
Where's the sign idiot the sign is the aussie telling you to get out
Mmmmmm, those dangly crunchy meaty forearms make fantastic appetizers before you rip their guts out for all the juicy inside bits.
Indisputable proof stupidly knows no borders 🤣
He must be a police officer because he would rather get eaten and die than swallow his pride and admit that he’s made a mistake and thank the other guy for his help and concern! 😂😂
I hope the crocodile eats him that's the best use for his tipe of idiots
Get the Darwin Award ready
If I am in the sea or up a mountain for snow boarding and there is no one else around, I always think "do they know something I don't"
If there’s one thing an Aussie knows is that pretty much all forma and flora out there is out to get you. Heck, even koalas have chlamydia and cute possums carry a nasty bacteria (Buruli ulcer). Platypus’ have venomous (why not eh? Everything else has) spurs on their hind legs. How an Australian child makes it to adulthood is a marvel of chance. When one says ‘that’s dangerous mate’ believe them like you have never believed anything before.
Aussi aussi aussi
He's not trying to save the man, he's trying to stop the crocodiles from getting a taste for human flesh and blood.
Honestly if that was the response from Papa Smurf here. I'd be more concerned a crocs going to get killed when it inevitable attacks him because he is out looking for one at this point.
If any Nth Queenslander is giving me info on crocs im listening!
You can't coach stupidity
Natural selection.
I would not need a sign! I don't even live there and even I know better!
Bloke like that is exactly where his meant to be
Well at least he is preserving himself from copping melanoma/skin cancer or stung by the fatal Irukandji jellyfish.....🥴
poor bloke is just causing more work for the ER staff
This guy isn’t hurting anyone. If he wants to take a risk let him take a risk. Give him a warning then after that, it’s not your problem.
Let them win a Darwin Award and erase the possibility of more morons being born
Murky water too, they'll bite anything that moves.
'Natural selection'
since I am from Florida I can relate.   Tourists are like toddlers, always trying to die.
….. just let Darwin do its thing
Man Bob Katter would’ve had a field day with that dope haha
When I was backpacking in innisfail TNQ this local jumped off the pier and as soon as he hit the water a croc got him he survived and ot was in the news, he did it to impress one of the girls in the hostel
Natural selection at work. Let him be! 😜
Aussies are funny blokes, they curse and yell as part of their normal dialogue. 😂😂
"You're near the boat ramp crocks hang around  waiting for fish"    (and ignorant tourists)😂😂😂😂
In America…..people would just pull out their phones
He was pleasantly warned😊
You're swimming in crocodile infested waters, they will attack and eat you.   "Yeah but where's the sign?"
Let me guess, he's american? 😂
He’s wearing a wet suit in North Queensland??
He looks like Dessert. Just needs a big dollop of ice-cream on top.
The British messed up sending all their men to Australia look at the state of Londonstan
I wouldn't interfere with natural selection
I wouldn't ever attempt that. He's insane. Maybe he wants to be ate?
The croc is like ""You heard him. Dont you got somewhere else to be.""
Cheaper than a trip to sweeden 😊 he defo got a death wish 😮
Some people just gotta die yk
😂😂😂 He may think he is invincible because he is wearing a stinger suit!!
"where's the sign"   Buddy, the wildlife doesn't care whether there's a sign or not
Leave him be , but keep the camera 🎥 Rolling. 😂
Leave him be, natural selection 😅😅😅
Love the stinger suit, sun protection… ha ha ha ..
Survival of the fittest
Time and again idiots ignore warningsigns , many times people go swimming despite warningsigns saying :shark infested waters swimming prohibited, and guess what happens?Yes they become lunch for local sharks.
Let him win a Darwin award.. One less oxygen thief
Nature has selected this man for a Darwin award.
If an Australian tells you, it's not a good idea it's definitely a really bad idea
natural selection
Natural selection at work!
yes, an Aussie telling you something is dangerous? Better take that advise :-)
F him. Let them guy get ripped apart.   We should cull  about 3 billion idiots.  Be a better planet
Natural selection at this point really.
Can’t even seen 6 inches below the water.. croc 🐊 could just be following and go full death roll his arm
OL Mate with Crocs on his feet.
A Smurf on a Sharkuterie board is unusual.
i would have started spashing the water violently..
Government needs a smurf education program on crocodile safety!
Just let natural selection take its course
Liberal minds😵‍💫
We had a bloke do the same thing in Ingham… we are like Mate no you can’t be on a paddle board in the hinchinbrook. Oldmate rekons im from port Douglas. 😂😂😂 eaten by a croc a few days later. And apparently was warned by others.
yeah righto, im a dumb tourist, what would a local know?
Where's the sign? Who needs a sign to know there are crocs in literally every body of water in Oz?
Let him get ate while the crock is full we will all be safer
Arrogant idiot - even the crocodile would agree
"Have some common sense" Having common sense fell out of fashion years ago. Now we do whatever we want and expect someone or the Govt to bail us out.
Darwin award nearing this idiot!
Let him get eaten..
This is the kinda guy who drank dishwashing liquid cause there were "no signs" saying not to
Leave him be
We as aussies do some sketchy stuff, but let the world know when we are warning you it no longer sketchy it’s a matter of when you will depart the earth as it’s a certainty
Croc: would you shut the go up mate?
don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it
If an Aussie tells you something is dangerous and you shouldn't do it. Don't do it.  The wildlife has already winnowed the gene pool to leave only those with the most sensitive sense of self-preservation to breed.
THAT CROCODILE BAIT SOUNDS LIKE AN ENGLISH 🇬🇧DUDE
Leave him alone, and let him win his Darwin Award.
Well at some point it just becomes natural selection at work, no? Good on the Crocs in this case, fair play.
In the middle of the ocean with a boogie board😂
Why on earth would you want to swim near saltwater crocodiles? 🤔 Crazy stuff.
Just leave the idiot
Also the dont blame the crocodile comment ....they all get unalived after an attack on a human...
Let it be natural selection.. this nation doesn't need European a holes.
What a mug
Yall interrupted his attempt at winning a Darwin Award.
The world would be better with him removed from the gene pool.
Atleast he is a stinger suit on 😂
I would have let the c**t get eaten.
Idk how people thought Australia was a habitable places the bugs and wild life out there is insane
Growing up in South Louisiana id paddle my inflatable boat in alligator infested water but I'd never do it with crocs
What a complete idiot
😂😂😂 How hard dude,  we have natural commonsense In our Aussie genes. The signs are specifically for tourists. Read them!🇦🇨.
Guys.... Let Darwin take this one.
As a Crocodile let this man do what he wants to do!
🐊"Mate shut up, thats farkin dinner"
I’d just go and get the popcorn 🍿
suicide by croc
This is likr a guy from colorado going to florida for the first time.
RIP blue lorax. Gone but not forgotten
Just leave him be, let the crocs eat
He doesn't want to be a witness to the  investigation.
Evolution still at work on humans. Has not sorted out everything yet...
That man is spoiling all the fun ... for the crocodiles.
In this world…. The paddle boarder is 1000% Democrat.  The guy on the pier is a Republican trying to talk sense.  That sense will be ignored bc they always know better, AND their family WILL have the Croc killed, bc Democrats (self serving only) take zero responsibility for anything.
We must let natural selection take its course.
let the guy win his darwin award.
Natural selection we need more of it
Aussie's are so chill when it comes to health and safety that you need to take any warning as a direct threat to life.
Same over here in Costa Rica, some tourists have 0 survival instinct 😅
Darwin will prevail. His stupidity will soon end the problem...   Yum yum croc
These are the same people that ride their bicycles on the road in their $tupid tights smh
Why bother ? Darwin award winner if ever I saw one.
The guy should’ve thrown a croc he was wearing
Natural Selection Mate
Darwin. Saw two Vietnamese men neck deep in water cast net fishing next to a 8m x 6m sign saying, 'Crocodiles Inhabit This Area'. Some people are just dumb.
Wait until they realize he’s got on chum underwear
hes from tazzy, repping north kingsland
OK, so what you’re saying is the only time you’re safe in the water in Australia is in your own bathtub?
Your in North Queensland, have some common sense, had me dying😂😂😂
"Crocodile recently seen sign" as the camera pans to show the dude is wearing Crocs.
I'm from England but travelled round Oz 20 years ago and north Queensland was the only place I wouldn't dip my toes... This man is a very silly cnt
Honestly just let nature selection take care of him atp
Everybody yelling at the man on the paddle boat needs to shut up. Because it is called selective reduction in the population let nature do us all a favor.
Stuff me .our crocs are gonna starve to death..dont tell him twice
Let him go .one tourist a year is a good reminder just keep pointing the camera at him😅
Let him be. If he gets ate that’s on him lol😂
Look a liberal in Australia!
This guy is a lefty 100% lol
U know what, natural selection at its best 😂
OK....let them..
"Where's the sign?"  "There, there, and THERE!"
Some people are just born to become a statistic. No matter how long they life, clearly they just lack survival instinct.
Do not interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake.
Serving himself up on a little platter
Let me do my thing
I have seen this guy in action and Those crocs don’t stand a chance against this guy’s superior maneuverability above and below water, superior armor, superior bite strength and unmatched appetite for anything living that is made of flesh. As of that wasn’t enough he’s clearly a genius too.
Get eaten and yeah then blame the signs you sont want to read.. please keep doing it..air is precious
C'mon.  The crocs need to eat and you'll get a viral video. Win win
Just let the darwinism moment happen.
He is paddling with his hands and  splashing on water. That’s like a call for crocs. I hope he has the brains to listen to kind folks who were warning him.
there are a pair of crocs on my feet right now
Man I would’ve loved to see him get attacked by a croc
Hate when this happens then they get takin and the croc has to die because of it 😢
natural selection
Why say anything? You’ll get a viral video if it goes wrong for him.
“Where’s the signs?”. Not too sure whether a croc really cares about the signs mate 😂
You would never see that croc coming until it had you  in that murky water
Hes food
Only crocs I see are on your feet mate
Its like they dont think the signs are real.
That guy might be from florida. I have never seen people be so flippant with their lives until I moved to the pan handle. Which is an important distinction to make when talking about fl. Whole families swiming in a river with venomous snakes literally floating by. And surfing with sharks. When telling these people what I witness they would look at me like i was crazy, shrug and keep doing what they were doing.
Shhhh you're scaring the prey
There is a saying in my country: The mother of idiots is always pregnant.
Leave the man be infact Invite him to bring the whole family help nature correct this unbalance
We need to stop trying to save these idiots just let them go you trying to save them is the reason there's so many dumb dumbs in the world let the Crocs balance the world
I'm from North Queensland those Karen's are over reacting
Idiot
My god, and i thought paddleboards were lame. Then this bloke comes paddling by on his kNeEbOaRd😂😂
At this point, just let em figure it out for themselves. I think  we've all suffered enough from trying to stifle Darwin's theory from modern society.
Animals got to eat too
If someone from florda or Australia tell you someone about aminals or crocodile you listen and ask if they can help get you out dont answer back or that listen they know what is dangerous when it comes to the aminals on there land
Leave him alone for gods sake.  Nanny state
He's the reason we have directions on how to use shampoo lol
There is always one idiot out there
Darwinism at its finest
I woukd sit out on the dock with some popcorn...l wouldn't have said a thing 😂
Im in the process of committing suicide could u please mind you're own business
What a twaffle 🤦🏻‍♀️
What a lovely blueberry 🫐 like to know what became of him 🤡💩
He's probably related to Harold Holt
Let the crocodiles have him. Stupidity must have consequences.
you'd be surprised how often these idiots think they can just do whatever they want
Common sense tells me when a Australian tells you its not safe...ITS NOT SAFE
Mate, even if you are in the safest location, in the safest country in the world, if there's an Aussie around and he tells you it is not safe, you listen! lol
Who let the gimp out?
Allow nature to do its thing in these situations. Natural selection needs to take place way more often
Keep a camera on him and get some yt action
Where's the sign? Really love the be a fly on the wall as you're explaining that logic to St. Peter.
You tell them once thats good enough
Oh thit, I wanted to see a croc !
He deserves to be eaten for the outfit alone ..
Just let that mf go I tried to save you mate😂
crocs have learned mind control, be careful out there folks.
Why does this remind me of some special someone who is friends with a guy who really f'in hates Norton
Ngl, I understand both men.
Bro has his jellyfish onezy on. But, zero survival instincts 😂
But where’s the part where he gets eaten by the Croc? Oh it didn’t happen!? Oh you were wrong this time??
Darwinism at it's best!
When you get done by it🤕 You will learn.
Social darwinsim mate, leave him to it.
Let natural selection happen
Darwin awards still going strong
Sharks aren't scary, people are paranoid about sharks for no reason... Crocs, you might be terrified of them and you still aren't scared enough.
Go do your own thing bud leave him alone😊
Keep filming you might get lucky😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine dieing from a crocodile because you didn't want to lose an argument with a stranger😂😂😂
to dumb to admit his mistakes
It's your funeral mate
Just leave him😂
As an Australian, I am all for helping people, but I also believe in Darwinism...
Is it twisted to say that i actually would not have done anything except ask him if he paddle boards and just have a conversation? Like its survival of the fittest at this point.
You warned the idiot what comes next is death or safety let him decide 😂
Imagine how many likes this video would get if he got bitten by a crocodile
Future croc 💩
Natural selection let them ride 😂
and if you know how to grunt them up you could have fed them right then and there. I showed 2 young nurses from Ireland and the UK and a janitor at the Singapore crocodile farm how to tell if there are crocs in the water when i grunted up around 50 in the pond at the farm LOL
can a croc digest a wet suit?
When I visited Darwin, I wouldn't even go near the water, even the legit swimming holes have crocs in them.
he sounds like a  pomy.
Sounds like the River monsters guy
Typical Queenslander tell em to fark off!
The sad thing is he has probably passed down his DNA by now!
Idiot. Hope a croc 🐊 takes a nibble.
"Everyone else is the problem"
Australia doesn't really have that many dangerous animals, really, just the bad snakes and the Saltwater Crocodiles, but the ones we have are REALLY BAD!  Saltwater crocodiles aren't like mountain lions, they don't resort to hunting humans out of desperation.  They resort to it out of mild peckishness.
Just let the croc have some fun saving the world 😅
Yeh, if an Aussie tells me it's farkin dangerous,  I'm listening to them
End the conversation and wait until the Croc has him in his jaws, then shout, "I told you so"
I’d have told him once then set up a deck chair
He should know… hes wearing crocs
How is he going to blame the croc if he gets done by it, he's done. Common sense
Where's the sign saying not to swallow razorblades ?
Don't warn him,you're spoiling the fun
The smurf is Australian, but the odds are he is from Melbourne. The man yelling is Aboriginal for sure.
Dressed like a seal in the sea in Australia is madness
That's a !@#$'in crocodile recently seen sign.
I love the “where the signs” proceeds to point out all the signs in eye sight
Saving the idiots is one reason for overpopulation! Stop it. 😂😂😂
I dont get it, let the nature do its thing, its natural selection.... We need this process to evolve
I don’t see any crocs, you don’t say? That’s the whole point mate, when you do see it, it’ll be too late.
if it wasnt for clowns like him the crocs would starve
Why can’t Aussies just mind their own business
He's a contender for the Darwin awards
Lol...natural selection in progress 😂
Im English and i wouldnt even turn the tap on in Oz and go near it
Just let natural selection do its thing i guess... madness
Man if they got a death wish, Australia is the perfect place. That's a man on a mission.
Even his Croc’s are mad at him for trying to sabotage their Grubhub order 😅
Northern Australian.... you don't walk or swim in the water. IDIOT
Id be in that guy's boat swabbing the deck quicker than you could say  skippy 😅
Let him go… natural selection will fix him…
I know a website that if you uploaded a crocodile attack video it would become very popular. Am I a bad person?
Murky water as well 😮. This bloke must be suicidal
Darwinian, positively Darwinian.
I will guarantee you a croc was looking and listening. You are never far from a croc at a boat ramp. They are scary MFrs.
Do you think F wits ike this see these videos... I hope they do. I hope they realise they are Darwin's proof of theory. All we can hope is that he does not reproduce.
Hes probably from Melbourne
What a arrogant piece of 💩
Eer was that guy was okay though? Nothing happened? 😰 right? Anybody know the aftermath
Typical boomer pig
Where is part II ?
Darwin Award in the near future…
Somehow it really is comforting to see that nice, well meaning normal people have to deal with total suicidal idiots in Australia, just as we do here in the US. I am convinced we have accidentally broken natural sellection with warning labels and signs. A far better world 8f humans would quickly emerge if we did away with all of it. No more animal warnings, just know where you are. No more warnings not to drink cleaning supplies, feel free. No more high voltage signs, cause you SAW the cables as thick as your wrist, right, Sparky? One generation later, the human species will surge ahead to curing cancer AND the common cold, most wars will cease, world hunger will end -- an immaculate new beginning... if we just stop warning them all the time and let em sort themselves out... right outa the gene pool.
I know they mean well, but C'mon, give Darwin his due!!
On day one of my first trip to  AUS, I was walking from my airbnb to town and saw a path through the woods to the beach. When I came through the trees there was a beautiful completely empty beach. I thought I had stumbled on to some secret spot. I walked along the beach to town stepped off the sand onto pavement and turned back to see signs everywhere saying crocs and jellyfish lol
and saltwater crocs actually have a taste for humans and activity hunt humans
Why argue with a local that just pointed pointed out that there a signs that says cros here and there. Like if a guy comes up to me and says hey there are some salt water cros around and you better be back on shore  im listening they're out there majority of the week why would you argue. Commonsense please 🙏
one THERE one there and another one there!!
Just let him get eaten ffs
Bait Bro really thinks this Ozzie is just some sort of waterside Karen trying to ruin his floating charcuterie board cos-play.
I'm a kiwi but I'll listen to the locals 😂
Croc_ we like diversity 😂😂
I’m begging my wife to move to Australia ! Love those people! One of the few places on earth a Greek would feel like home
Dingo.
Seems someone wants to commit suicide by croc.
Fair dingcume mate , watch the croc
Antivaxxer i bet.
Natural Selection at work
Natural selection at its best
I never liked the Smurfs anyway.... 🐊😂
Dont swim in the water there sharks
Cant say he didn't try. That fella is gonna end up being a crocs lunch.  Crocs aren't to be taken lightly. You think alligators are scary? Unlike alligators who are usually pretty docile, Crocodiles are extremely aggressive and dont care what you are. They WILL eat you.
Let Darwinian evolution do its thing 😂
Yeah Nah, I`ll just sit here with my camera on you waiting for the show to begin.
‘Where’s the sign?’ on the highway alerting you that you were entering northern Queensland. The danger is assumed at that point.
I...I think you were talkin' to a crock in a blue body suit.  Look at way its' waving its' hands in the water like it's drownin'.
Was he ever seen again??
One does not sumply swim in North Quensland.
Maybe dying is the goal.
In areas folks fish, if there are no water fowl . . . there is a REASON.
Natural selection  at work.  David Attenborough will begin his monologue in just a moment.
Australians have pet spiders the size of dinner plates. If they say beware...BEWARE!!
This is just as strong of a warning as Florida Man saying, “Hey bud, I wouldn’t do that!”
🤡
Let the evolution do it's job!
If you have to get fully dressed to go swimming, you're the problem
🏊 🐊
Idiotic people, like this tourist, get crocodiles killed
Darwin‘s theory. Let him go.
I love natural selection
The idiot on the boogie board sounds Aussie, he should fuckn know better. I'm from South Australia and I know better than to go swimming where the crocs are.😂😂😂
Dude in the blue suit definitely votes Democrats
Looks like bait
Even the crocs don't like him!
Some people, you just can't talk to
Natural selection at it's finest, just hope that wet suit don't give the poor croc indigestion 😂...everything in Australia bites,pinches,or stings....js🤷‍♂️
Das Krokodil sieht dich schon Stunden lang bevor du es selbst bemerkt hast!!! Es wartet auf den richtigen Moment! Was machst du mit so einen Scheiß dort am Meer, fahr in die Türkei damit!!! Solch Leute haben einfach nur wahnsinniges Glück!! Hat schon einen Grund warum das Meer dort so sauber ist!!! Mein bester Freund wohnt dort, und er selbst sagt, sogar in eine pütze würde er nicht reingehen! Und der trottel ist mit so ein Plastik Scheiß am Meer, da fehlen mir die Worte…. Ist er wenigstens gefressen worden? Oder hat ihm der blaue Neopren Anzug geschützt von den crocos…?
The croc "HEY STOP PLAYING WITH MY FOOD"
The guy in blue probably likes running across highways during rush hour even though there is an pedestrian bridge 50 ft away.
With idiots such as these, it's best to let mother nature take its course. Don't bother warning them next time.
Woke Victorian
Some people are just so dumb they can’t be told anything
How dare him blame the good old crocodile ?... Crocodile will be polite and will not refuse a free snack at all ... Is all about good manners
In Florida we say ANY body of water you can assume there are gators in it😊
U warn them, shut up and let them die
Leave the man alone. Let Darwinism do its thing.
Fools everywere
He says "you're in north Queensland, have some common sense"  In America when they warn you about the location you're in, it's to let you know about thugs, robberies, gangs, etc.  Not man eating dinosaurs
I love the water. As a south Floridian I’ve been around all kinds. If I were to visit Australia, I’d be dang sure I was not in salt water crocks favorite place to be. Yikes!
Let him be. Sometimes it’s best to just let nature run its course.
" Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by em "!! 😂😂😂
Oh no , that dude is really insane !     😄👉🏻👉🏻
Honestly, sometimes you gotta let them improve the gene pool by removing themselves from it…
Hahah the Smurf Man on the miniature surf board … what a tool.
Let’s follow this guy around with a camera and make it a common thing there. That would make for some entertaining tv
natural selection. Once you give a warning just let nature do its thing
😂😂the man said let him die in pieces
Entitled rich people
Darwin Award on deck
Croc: dont tell him im out here!!!
Man eaters.. and dude is a small man
Let him do his thing, probably better that he doesn’t breed anyway, and it’s a halfway decent meal for a saltie
Ow just Let him get his Darwin award Just don’t forget to send me the footage
Croc things: Eat here or take away?
Carry on Mate as u were u don't mind if I grab out my camera😂
just saw a pair of crocs in the vid as you were talking too.
I wonder if his board was big enough... Thinking it's not.
I don't want to see this guy die but man, if a large croc came up close to him this could be a video that gets played at the airports with a warning; " Don't be this guy!"
If an Aussie is telling you something your doing isn't a good idea you might want to listen. We know a thing or 2 about our own country.
It's a miracle how this man-smurf has managed to stay alive for so long!
What afuckwit he's the reason why place's get shut down. Just an idiot waiting to be attacked
American tourist?
Things not to do in Australia. Number one, swim in any body of water.
Guy should learn to mind his own business 🙄🙄
Humanus Dipshitacus in his natural habitat, feeding the crocs,,, with himself.
Crazy
A light snack.....
New Zealanders smh 🤦‍♂️
Natural selection 😂
Must be a Democrat from California 😂😂😂 let him swim please thanks 🇺🇸🇺🇸🍻🤟🏻👍🏻
I wouldn't go in those waters in a boat 30 times that size
Why would anyone live in Australia where everything can unalive you.
Croc “Mate would you shut up, Ive been waiting for my lunch for 20mins, have some common table manner mate”
"Two things are infinite in the world. The universe and human stupidity. And I'm not sure about the universe."
Let the crocs have him at this point 😂
Arguing with a LIBERTARIAN 😜
You can lead a horse to water but you make him drink.
Lunatic
I love how every aussie is an expert on dangerous animals
I can’t believe he expects signage! What a tool, he’ll be the first to cry foul if he loses a limb or worse! You’re in their territory and they move around so signs aren’t always relevant…why risk it!!!
Gets eaten by a crocodile because he’s being incompetent then croc gets hunted down and dies for it🤷‍♂️
Natürliche Auslese
Sometimes you just have to remember the teachings of Darwin and let nature take it's course. If a couple of these blokes get snapped up, it'll improve the overall IQ.
just let darwinism takes it path
Somebody he trusts told him Crocodiles don't eat smurfs
Listen to the locals deckhead
Here in America,  we call it Timothy Treadwell syndrome.
Ive been There its no joke
Natural selection is good!!
Natural selection, but I know the poor croc would be blamed for idiots like this.
Go ahead I need some good content 😅😅
“Let me do my thing !”   Croc :- Oh , man in blue ! Nice !
Crocs can read signs?
Stop croc blocking bro😂😂
that's how average crocodile movies starts
Saltwater Crocodile
If you watch this video with the Oblivion NPC music it makes a lot more sense
Guys it's not about 'being an Aussie' telling him off!!! The guy on the paddleboard is Aussie, he's just an idiot!!! When it's saltie territory you just don't go there!! Next minute said idiot gets taken and then the croc gets hunted down for just being a croc and seeing an easy meal, or the wrong animal gets caught in the process, either way tourism $$ get affected for the local community etc.... it's horrible for the animal, horrible for the idiots poor family and the witnesses and a major pain in the a$& for the whole community
He is all good as he has a stinger suit on.
Come on even the croc needs an easy meal
"Looks like meat is back on the menu, boys!"
keep recording !!!
Nah, mate, I reckon just leave that idiot get eaten by Crocs... And let him experience it first hand and don't help him... what an idiot...👏👏👏🐊🐊🐊
Naw bro I would call the cops and have him admitted, he’s literally smacking the water 😂he’s BEGGING to get attacked, that’s precisely how u get a croc to come out, disgraceful seeing an old Aussie dude who’s never seen Steve Irwin call out crocs on video 🙄
That's exactly how liberals paddle lol.
Estupido 😮.. 😳
what a mango head...arguing... where's a croc when you need one !
Common sense ain't so common bro!
If I'm visiting somewhere and a local tells me not to do something, I'm thanking them profusely as I immediately stop doing whatever it is. I don't get people, man.🤦🏽‍♀️ Especially in Australia 💯
What a complete bell end.
If someone known to swim with dangerous predators warn me it's not safe to swim,I wouldn't doubt them..😂
I give him a few hours
Did dumbo made it or became dinner
Any word about his fate ? Serious question. I tried googling " man killed by crocodile while paddling " didn't throw up any bites.
Normal humans request you let that idiot get eaten so it doesn’t breed
♫ Duuumb ways to die. ♪ So many dumb ways to die. ♬
Well, at least he's not going to be stung by box jellyfish in that outfit.
Seems suicidal to me
Let him. Natural selection
Smurf
Did he die?
Australia has the deadliest animals. If one is warning you...listen.
I wonder if this guy ever died
Need to start letting natural selection make a comeback
Common sense ain't that common.. Jesus 😮
Nah them ain't gonna be my ghost clothes for eternity fam..
😂
bro just want to suicide..
* suspiciously long snouted green human with a tail and comically baggy overcoat waddles over * “Now now gentlemen lets not be so narrow minded…”
Let him do what he wants to do.  Make sure you POST IT ON YouTube.
I won't swim in water without 100 metres visibility, so I don't swim much 😅
Only Stupidity Swims In These Waters. 🤦
This is 95 percent of the reason crocs are portrayed as monsters, because people dont understand how to behave The other 5 percent is , well yeah ,they are infact monsters,but we are also supposed to be the smartest animal on the planet
He must be on vegemate
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it 😂😂😂
Natural selection 🤷🏽‍♂️ 🤷🏼‍♀️
Croc:”hey dont yell my food you idiot!!
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"😂😂😂😂😂
fake video, blurred face means fake video
If he had his legs hanging off they’d be gone.
What an idiot he’s diving with death.
Blueys dads voice just why
Listen to the locals bro, they know
Drive through takeaway the crocs! 😂😂
toye me crocadyle deyn, myte, toye me crocadyle deyn...
There's a warning sign when you enter the country mate. It says "AUSTRALIA" 😂
i mean he is dressed like a fish aswell he is just asking for it!
😂😅🎉 yeah righto he says I'm still alive for now🎉😂
“Fools Rush In Where Angels Fear To Tread” For me it’s a case of live and let die 💀 if people are that foolish then karma comes quickly to rid them from the food chain! (See Darwin’s Theory Of Natural Selection!)😆🤣
Plus last year 2 people were killed by salties
North Queensland is croc haven, bro was serving himself on a plastic platter
Imagine trying to die, in THAT outfit!
If he gets taken he suffers , his family suffers, and in the end the crocodile suffers for doing what comes naturally to it
Darwin says, let him swim.
This dude definitely an outsider brainless
i hope he as eaten
Lunch!! 😁
Hahaha, Darwin's Theory right there
Was he American like me?
What?!😂
North Queensland is croc HEAVEN.
The tourist is all covered up because he's afraid of the SUN!
The Australian equivalent of a MAGAT.
Crocs don’t eat blueberries 🫐
The crowd was quiet like "Finish Him!" quiet!
Let that man proceed with natural selection
To be fair, if there are no crocodile signs, there is 0% chance of a crocodile being in the area. Can't blame the guy for not believing the obvious over exaggeration
You just can't save some people from themselves. Happy paddling!
In the dumb guys defense, there really aren’t many places in the world where worrying about getting ambushed by an animal is worth keeping you away from what you love to do. It seems like Crocodiles and Tigers are the only two animals that choose to hunt and eat humans with regularity for no reason other than they are hungry. Sharks really don’t do this unless they are starving or mistake you for something else but it sounds like crocs will eat you for fun. Terrifying.
a simple thank you would do bro
"Crocodile"- Mmmmm brined human😋
"Just let me do my thing" ? Yeah ok mate does that 'thing' involve your blue wet suit being folded in half with you in it and having your limbs twisted off of your body? If so then by all means, go ahead.
Don't blame the crocodile mate !
Dude the sign was ' WELCOME TO AUSTRALIA '. That should have been enough.
Just keep filming him, bc this is going to be very real soon
Oi! Theess blaoke isn't abaout t'jump the shahk...   Ee's abaout to jump IN the crokky, oi reckon.  🤨
“ it won’t happen to me.” On his tombstone
Wheres the sign? LOLOLOL. Is that going to be on his headstone?
Lay off let the Croc do its thing.
Most likely a mental health issue.
I would be "ohhhemmgeee I didn't realize... may I get in your boat? Will you help me to shore? I'm an idiot thank you! Duh
Let me guess-an American?
if australian is not doing it. i surely wont
So how dumb are you then😂😂
Yeah but the crocs need to eat too 😂
Out of all the crocodile/alligator subspecies the salties in Australia are at the very top of the list for no fcking thank you.
Let Darwinism run it’s course and remove stupidity from the gene pool.
He was never seen again
As a saltwater 🐊, I can confirm blue Wiggles are our comfort food.
blame the greens and federal gruberment. as a kid i sailed the Cairns inlet. it used to be safe.
I lived in Cairns, the paddler is an idiot
Muppet
To be fair, when I was in North Queensland the locals seemed kinda sick of having to tell people this.
Hey Mate come and try that in the Proserpine river. You wouldn't even get the first reply in before you got taken..... You are an idiot. As far as i'm concerned we should let natural attrition take these fools. That way the rest of us wouldn't need to drag our feet so the dumb arses can keep up. THIS IS WHY WE ARE GETTING DUMBER AS A SPECIES.
I’m not concerned for him, it’s the repercussions for the croc when they attack and eat said human that bother me
Why does this guy talk exactly the same as the granddad from Bluey? Don't people have something better to do than copy a cartoon?
Tourists feed the crocs in Nth Q  Feed themselves by their stupidity
What an idiot!!! Rebellion is loosing common sense nowadays!!!!
As if a sign means anything in Australia....
Was in Cairns last week. A large vite. Barron river runs through it. There's a couple of large crocs liviynear the main highway bridge.
Dude saltys are not poisonous.
Crocodile Dundee rolling over in his grave lol
Natural selection at its finest mate
What a looser  “They are only signs aren’t they !” Crock bait for sure.
I mean...... what in the actual duck does he look like!!! 😂😂😂😂
Can people just stop messing with natural selection please!!!!!
JUST FILM HIM GETTING CROC FOOD LOL 😂😂
when Crocodile Dundee tells your insane .... run
I’m trying to commit suicide.  Leave me alone 😳😄
And this video was the last time he was ever seen…
He wears that when he's on his bike too 😂
Make money,  sell tickets. The paddlefloat will definitely save him from a crocodile attack
Bro when the ozzy tells yeah it’s dumb what you’re doing… fucken listen mate
Have some common sense... Golden. What a better knowing idiot...
Stop warning him.  I need more eaten alive content
I’m pullin out my comfy chair and a bag of popcorn and a Twix bar! I’m excited for the show to start!
Leave him there, let nature take its course
He's probably a tourist from Hoboken, New Jersey....
😂😅 sshh, leave it up to Darwin!
Ohhh crocs round here let me splash around and float on the water like a big injured turtle
You're in North Queensland.....GET OUT OF THE WATER !!!
Looks like there was a couple of different citizens One voice came way away the lady like she was quite a ways down so she's not attached to the fella who's trying to save his life there's another woman over there local yes local who is screaming at the guy basically saying hey they'll eat anything they see and you're just not dead yet cuz they're really they're still waking up LOL we have people all around the world in the United States in all over the world that will do the dumbest things ever they might be brilliant people but common Sense seems to be in short supply
Darwin list???
Natural selection is a powerful thing  Let him continue and allow nature to take its course 😂
Was anybody else waiting for the I told you so moment
Clearly, the man has a death wish.
Na mate there just logs go about your buisness mate
Richard craniums from south of croc country for ya. Yeah I croc aware but is doing something making themselves an attack waiting to happen. And it's the poor old croc who gets blamed for darwinism
🤦‍♂️   ☠️
I Live In North Queensland.  The Amount Of Times I've Had To Say This As Well. 🙄
The signs may not have worked but that concerned citizen was both helpful and convincing ! I would listen to him
Fkn liberals.
Whats with the outfit
What a boffoon
Croc food
Self correcting problem
Just let natural selection feed the crocs
He now can only paddle in a circle due to a missing arm 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️
Ah come on he's dressed up like a sardine too
I do not trust people, but l trust Australians
Its called natural sélection simply . The retards take care of it themselves literally 😅😅. 👊👊
Australia isn't as dangerous as people say, there's a good 13% of animals not even remotely interested in killing you.
Ahh just let him go and record the mayhem that is about to occur 😅
Imagine hearing an Australian accent telling you to beware of wildlife and just ignoring... id never
Possibly the last sighting of this paddler...
Did he get deaded
What about sharks?
Let natural selection do its thing
" Hey , you on the ramp.... Yes you, leave the guy alone" --Crocodile
thats a very elaborate way for sui*ide
I love how Australians are so casual about the dangerous wildlife, "don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"😂
One of the few animals on the planet that sees humans as prey and he's dressed up for a date with one.
Croc be like...  Do you know how  hard it is to get a  "Happy Meal" DELIVERED around here?!!
Geek
Stop being a Karen a let the man do his thing
Tourist who just don't listen is nuts. Guess what, we live here & we are only trying to help you get home  ALIVE. Trust us!
Chas. Darwin was right
Just leave him alone.  Why do people care about life so much???? Its not that great
And that night Mr Crocodile and his family ate well. 😂
When you see the croc, you’re already done.  Don’t take chances with dinosaurs
Australians might have caved to their government but if one tells you you’re in some dangerous territory listen to them. They deal with some of deadliest animals on the planet daily. 😂
"There's no signs here" I would have said "crocodiles can't read man. They don't know where they're meant to be"  Idiots
Karens live everywhere, and rules don't apply to them. Darwinism at work.
He's not to Bright ! Those things can jump like 6ft out of the water . They weigh like 1000 pounds at 17ft. No thank you!
Darwin working down under to thin the herd
oh dear
Croc food, dessert too
Darwin needs to eat.
ive seen worse
Let natural selection handle it
Old mate says im fully aware of that 😂😂  Yeah so is Cyril the 20ft salty
Aussies are A LOT different to Americans.  We don’t exaggerate.
A prime example of a Darwin awards nominee.
Yeah right-o
Croc "Christmas arrives early"
Sounds like a Pom... Enough said...
Thank God no Crocs were hurt that day.
what is this dude even doing lol
What an idiot 🙄
Darwin award
Kneeboarders and bodyboarders are at greater risk because from below they look like sea turtles..whereas surfers look like dolphins,so the attack rate is much higher for bright blue slow moving bags of meat..
I hate people interfering with evolution.
Looks like an older gentleman. I'm surprised he's lived as long as he has. 😂
Call him a flaming gulah
what an awkward paddle board
This man is such a fool
I dunno always just laugh when I hear the Aussie accent, even when they’re being serious it just sounds funny every time.
Imagine someone trying to save your life and you act this way.. i wouldve walked away and filmed the attack at that point
No let them find out survival of the fittest darwin award to them
Tasty smurf
Was expecting a croc filming
Darwins law
Talking about common sense while also floating on a little raft while knowing there  are crocodiles is crazy
Ahh natural selection at its finest
Where's the sign! He needs signs!!! Eh  Right next to the one that says "Crocodile Restaurant All You Can Eat Self Service"
A man can’t even risk his life in peace 😂
Ye but we all know that this rule only applies to other humans not australian men cos crocs are fkn terrified of them psychos
Even when they’re warning people, it’s like they’re picking a fight. That’s not how you warn someone. “Sir, did you see the sign?” that’s how you do it. You can keep all the “if this” and “if that” to yourself.
Those crocs are waiting for fish..😂
Where’s the ‘soign’ - there, there and there.
Idiot
Is there a part two? You know the part where he sees the croc and starts screaming that he had no idea there were crocs in the water.
She just wants to feed the crocs. Show some understanding, man. Let her do her thing.
Im starting to think people needs training to come to our country
He is wearing a stinger suit but forgot about the crocs. 🤣
😂 I scrolled down to the next video and I got crocodile eye being the most evolved eye and like 😂
I can't figure out if the one piece suit or swimming there was a worse decision
just let darwin kick in
when an Aussie is telling you youre doing something wild it should snap you back to reality immediately
I thought the rule for Australia and america was......... how do u know crocks or gators are in the water? If its wet theres crocks or gators in there 🤔 😂😂
Snackies 😂
Old dude literally crazy
His he on holiday from Melbourne?
He'll be right 😅
Natural selection at play...let it be 😊
Where’s the sign ? How about u do some research before you enter a unknown  body of water especially in Australia
He just wanred to feed the crocodiles 😮
So a person can't walk around in America because America is filled with _____ folks?
Stop harrasing the tourists...lol...
Natural selection.
I would be afraid of puddles in Australia
Is he a yank??
The guy giving helpful advice is himself right at the water’s edge.
You know he just want the Darwin Award
I’ve been to North Queensland, at night in practically every body of water with the lights turned on in your car you’re going to see reflecting eyes everywhere  That Smurf is crazy
If the man wearing crocks warns you about crocks, you better listen.
The sign is you're in Australia!
"No harm in paddling through these waters " 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He deserves a darwin award....
PURE IGNORANCE!!!!!!!!!
Yeah.....  you won't catch me in the water in Australia!
This is a man going for the Darwin award.
and all aussies wear crocs, so the spiders have  enough exits
🐊 "leave the bloke alone"
😂😂😂
I wouldn't climb into a paddling pool in Australia, doesn't matter where you are there's something waiting to have a go.
Shid a blue seal for tucker 🤤🤣🤣
Saving his life and the dude's mad 😂
Let natural selection do its thing.
That was some great camera work
If you’ve got the Australian guy nervous something’s about to happen 😂😂
Darwin rules. Stop saving the collateral damage
You told him to "go do what you wanna do," but you're still telling him what he should do. How about you MYOB, and if he's killed It's on him.
Nominated for a Darwin award?
Literally a turtle silhouette in that board
U lost him at common sense, barely a thing today woth people
Big 20 footer CROC:  let him be mate i show him around my joint 😏🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖
How has he lived that long in Australia
But did he die?
Natural selection
Today’s idiot is tomorrow’s crocodile s**t.
People will dig their heels in and be stubborn af as long as it means they dont admit being wrong.  Carry on lad. Crocs are prolly hungry anyway.
Natural selection at some point 🤷
Listen to locals😮
Guy was 100% oblivious then argues when someone tries to save him from an early death that's wild af.
come on man...  _he was feeling blue_
Imagine swimming in the sea where sharks and crocodiles are and then dying and people blaming the animal.
He defo wants to be eaten alive
He’s wearing crocs. Crocs everywhere!!!
Ah, natural selection at work......
The funny thing is, nobody in the comment section are mentioning he is dressed in a blue onesie, the guys nuts.
it's Darwinian leave him alone- he suffers from Dunning Krueger syndrome which makes him think he is competent.
Saltie: "Yummy!! It looks like Tourist is on the menu again!!"
Got to be a politician.
Hahaha 😂
Natural selection... let it be
Nature is taking its course creating another Darwin Award winner 🏆
Shhhh... There are too many iidiots on the PLANET.
And the Darwin Award goes to that guy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
By God if an Aussy told me he recently seen a big Croc in the area. You'd see B lining it to the beach with a brown exhaust trail behind me.
When an Aussie tells you not to swim somewhere do. not. swim .there.
Hahahahahahha
Dressed like that
Delusional liberal left woke idiot spoilt brat.
Why stop evolution?
That was my grandfather.  Rip 🙏
Id swim there. These Karens love to worry lol
The bloke on the paddleboard sounds like a public servant.. A REAL flogger..
All this time, the crocodiles were on his feet 👀
He just wants to get his own Darwin award. Greedy
Natural selection.
I bet this guy is a Refugees welcome here type guy
and the Darwin award goes to...
Lass se doch, eine weniger von denen ist gut für alle ! 😂
“Go ahead mate go do what you wanna do…”  Knows this is going nowhere 😅
Circle of Life. Let him do his thing you did your best.
Like the outfit.  Probably bought at Kathmandu in Melbourne.  Hope it doesn’t get caught in the Crocs teeth.
Well karma is a crocodile sometimes....
Darwin Award right there!
Film it properly-wot are you doing
"Leave him alone!"  - The Croc
😂 imagine having to argue with someone to save their life. We live in a world where kids are raised by screens and parents have zero accountability for the POS kids that miraculously make it to adulthood. And the worst part is each time they breed It’s just progressively getting worse and people wonder why the world’s going to 💩. I’m not smart in any capacity, but I’ve gotta imagine that our combined IQ of the whole entire world is gonna be half what it used to be by now.
Let the blue idiot figure it out
Aussie tells me have sense: Which way to safety good man and can i buy you a pint?
Concrete dwellers have no common sense in nature.
Im from Southern Qld and when in the North listen to the locals like your life depends on it!
Survival of the fittest has really lowered the bar
"Im fully aware", but doesnt know how to read a sign. Just let natural selection do its job
Im right, il not from here.. tell me where im. Wrong 😂😂😂😂😂😂 fwwking dunce
We keep getting in the way of natural selection. Let the herd be thinned!
"yeah righto" as he is being death rolled like a ragdoll
Be far left don't like to be told 😂😂😂
Well, is he still alive?😂😂😂
As a Canadian with a bit of common sense you wouldn’t catch me in that water unlit was as solid boat. Just like I’d tell someone in grizzly country cooking beacon for breakfast is a bad idea!!!
There just signs , definition of sign
Only tell him once to clear your conscious,nature feeds of idiots, and we don't want idiots to breed up the next generation stay the smart country that respects and understand our animals and territories
Relax bud. We do it all the time in Florida.
Spotting crocs while wearing crocs is crazy
Let him remove his genes...
Tourists  don't understand our ways, f#$k with being an idiot. 👋🏼😂
When an Aussie with IQ of 10 tells you to get , you don’t question his intelligence😂😂😂😂😂
Angry like the pommes.
Did he get eaten
You don’t need a sign to know not to swim with salt water crocodiles, it’s just common sense.
If an Australian is telling you it’s a bad idea, it’s probably a bad idea (mate).
😂Crocs favourite " blue fin Spooner"
Natural selection let them go
Sharks as well ?
He's a compo chaser who will sue the crocodile for ignoring the sign.
Where’s the sign? Points out 3 in close proximity.  Nahh mate it’ll be fine
Darwinism
He is trying for the Darwin award
That water does looks beautiful though.
Ppl never read signs
Let Darwin take it's course....😅
Even the aussies are avoiding the water. I wouldn't be within 2 miles of it 😂
no one asked you, “mate” 🤫. Will let you know if I need your chattering and nagging but don’t hold your breath
😉🇭🇲🦘🇦🇺 As an Aussie anything under 2-5 mrts Bring it on!!!! 😤💥💪💥✊🤛🦵💥💥🩳🐊🇭🇲🦘🇭🇲🦘🇭🇲🦘🦘🦘🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲
As a floridian, i feel your pain!
When the locals give advice listen
Look, I spent way too much time as a kid being afraid there was a shark in the deep end of the swimming pool. If there's even a ghost of a chance there are crocodiles in any given body of water, that eliminates any possibility that I'll go in it
...Girlfriend new to Canada...Hunny if we see a moose Can we pet him?....Yes dear But i bet you only get to do it once
These are the kind of people I worry about not a brain cell in there head and a complete liability
Austrailians are always good at telling me stuff i dont want to hear.
Crocodiles in the ocean that's crazy!
Thinning the herd one Darwin Award at a time
Ffs
100% spot on mate. Love it, I say same all the time
idiot
I hear croc’s especially love Smurfs, on a paddle pop stick 🤦🏻‍♀️  I wouldn’t even dive into a NT pool without checking it first. The bloke literally wanted to win a Darwin Award lol
Let the poor man win his Darwin Award.
There's a few ares where Crocodiles, sharks snakes and spiders... fight for dominance.... So ya... heed the warnings..
Umm... Crocs don't read signs. In fact, they can't read anything.
Some people just want to die
I’m a liberal, the crocodiles will leave me alone because they respect my Twitter bio😊
It’s about to get dark and twisted
Looks like natural selection to me 🤷🏻‍♂️ enjoy your meal Mr Crocodile😂
Hes already thieving oxygen. And you're helping him.
"Man torn apart by crocodile for the 8th time" type news article
I’ve seen the saltwater crocodile videos. No chance I’m getting anywhere near there.
Let learn the hard way 😂
I think the croc sighting came from his feet.
Theres a reason why no one is ever in the water at the beach in Australia.
It doesnt matter what part of the world u go to if u hear someone sounding Aussie telling u ur an idiot for what ur doing u might wanna re evaluate ur situation.
A Darwin award in the waiting
Australia is a real life. Jumanji this man is playing with his life
Why women lives longer than men
You just can't tell some folks nothing
Sometimes you just have to let Darwin's law play out.
Let hit be croc food. It’s called natural selection for a reason.
Natural selection.
Smurf don’t care. Croc says yum 🐊
Doesnt need to be a sign😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He just crocblocked that croc
The smurf sounded like a pom.
Natural selection right there RIP meathead !
Croc chum. If you ask me
Australians love to be eaten by creatures
Id be listening to the locals .
Why are people outraged by this? Let natural selection just happen.
Sometimes you have to let evolution take its course.
The usual suspects not respecting God’s creation.
You got to let Darwinism win stop warning people
"and every three months in Queensland someone gets mauled to death by a crocodile
Nowadays, Commonsense is a superpower, sir!!!!
Did the nuthouse get the bloke back home ok?
Crocs in the water and Muslims on the land,pretty much the same thing!
Pops ain't worried, ain't no croc gonna catch him on his speed boat ⛵😮
Dumb ways to die, so many dumb ways to die 😂
When the locals tell u get the fk out u get out
Let people do what they want to. Fatal consequences are not your fault
Its true, cabbages have no brains.
This is nature doing some gene pool administration
He sounds South African.. The one on the water.
Just chum the water and enjoy the show already
The crocodile agrees with the guy in the water! Just let him go on with his day lol
At least he's got his stinger suit on, safety first 😅
The gene pool has just been weakened
lol same man will call for help to the same people trying to warn him
Yeah they like to wait for fish and …. IDIOTS LIKE YOU ! 😂😬🤨
That suit😂😂😂😂😂
All Danger warnings should be spoken in an Australian accent. IF an Australian says Danger you'd better take heed
We call those people "Republicans" here in the USA.
That guy in the water must be from down south.
Croc dinner served on a plate, and he's annoyed at being given some friendly advice from a concerned local.😅
When an Australian is stressing about something, you should listen😮 plus they know those waters, he clearly don't.
Kind of people who try getting a species wiped out for being attacked when its fully their fault
Darwin award
Idiots will idiot regardless of what people say.
darwinian let him at it 😮
The Aussies are always first to jump in and when they don't, LEAVE!
Well atleast he had his protection suit on for box Jelly fish!
What a crocblocker
Do crocs eat smurfs though?
He gives them lip when they're trying to help.  Shut up, thank them and get out of the water.
Natural selection
Looking for trouble with a flashlight
Im from australia and when an aussie tells you not to do something, you definitely listen. that guy's definitely not aussie if he's doing that
He’s dressed like a quick croc snack too!
Suicide by croc ?
Mate the shlt you find in cairns is unbelievable 😂😂😂
North Queensland. It actually says, "Fukkn" on the "Fukkn Crocodile Recently Seen!" sign.
Sometimes Natural Selection is what it is😂
People pay to walk over active volcanoes...I'd wish this man the best of luck and and be on about my business.
Wheres the sign? Points out 3 😂😂😂😂
Arguing with a guy trying to save you from being eaten by crocodiles is insane.
I can't believe he needs a sign....LOL
What a idiot, he has a death wish 🤣🤣 thats natural selection at hes best
Just let him be. His family can apply for his Darwin Award.
Darwin award?
Listen when people are swimming in gymph suits just leave them
Get his name and details just in case , and then go online and get a life insurance policy on the guy...
Crazy guy
Darwin?
He's just testing his new crocodile suit.😂
Just let nature sort itself out
Why don't y'all mind your own business let the man paddle Christ
coz play croc edition
Crocodiles gonna croc... They just doing thier part to prune the dumber bits from the gene pool.
Let it happen it’s called natural selection
Darwin Award Candidate.
Only help people who deserves to be helped
Idiots😂
„Stop GASLIGHTING him! If he wants to be in the waters, let him be!“ - 🐊 -
This is why overpopulation is being overrated
I love that beautiful concrete pad you're standing on while arguing with some deathly daredevil
Crocodiles are harmless
I'm not from down under and even I know to check for the signs.
Thats NOt a Croc There is a CROC😅😅😅😅😅😅
When an Aussie says go ahead mate, but don’t blame the crocodile, you know he’s worried about the bad reputation the croc will get for having this idiot as tucker.
Natural selection
Guy came properly dressed for the Darwin Awards.
Must be from the US
Natural selection
You can get away riding toys like that here in florida with alligators but this man has low IQ to do this in crocodile infested waters of Australia.
Natural selection at work
It’s called natural selection just let him go.  Just by the color of his hair I can tell he’s a leftist.
Not your relative let him go. You warn them once, you did your job now leave them
If you listen closely you can hear a crocodile say, “Mind your business, Mr. Karen.” 😮😮😮
Probably voted for Joe Biden too
Don’t blame the he  crocodile when you get done by it mate  🤣🤣🤣At least you warned him. 👍🏻
Love it. Crazy his DNA has made it to this point.
You just can't help some people
arguing with a guy for trying to save his life
🐒🐒🐒 🎵 They'd stick their thumbs in their ears and say "oh crocky dear" nanny nanny boo boo you can't catch us even if you wanted to 🎵
No sense of dangers sadly
That guy on the board has to an American .
Mind your own business
You know what the problem is??? Just keep your mouth shut
What's the Teletubby trying to do?
I ain't worried about no Crocodile they only eat meat .
do the crocodile dundeee
If an Aussie tells you your in danger, believe your in danger mate
Listen mate, if he’s not gonna listen to you, let’s see if he’ll listen to Darwin.
Common sense would be not venturing into the land of nightmares to begin with
Not all clowns wear costumes
Did he get found by a croc?😂
Did he get bit? 🤣
"Waiting for fish"... 😂 Yea today more like waiting for him to get close enough... Better believe they noticed him waayyy before you all warned him and that's how it happens everytime.
Literally dressed as a fish 😂
I remember fishing tiburon near SF and yuppies would be in full wet suits swimming 50 yards from where we were catching sharks n batrays 😂
Bro why TF would you even consider staying the water when a guys telling you there’s crocodiles in there!? It’s a F****** beach. There’s water and beaches EVERYWHERE. Just go to another section! This dude is delusional
Tell me you are crazy without telling me you are crazy... no fear of crocs ?! He is a madman
Nobody is worried about him, they just dont want an innocent croc to get shot
Lunatic,I love the aussie guy just saying it how it is😂😂😂
Shut up and mind your own business
If they don’t take the time ti read the danger sign I wouldn’t take the time to tell them let them get eaten…
Don't tell him just go get a 6pack and enjoy the show
They are literally trying to save his life
You're in Australia, mate. Have some common sense.
Average Floridian
The crocs-"A stop scarin of me dinner!"
😂😂😂
Australians have become pansy’s. Took all those vaccines and got put in camps. And no one went rambo to stop it
Truly.a.mad man🎉
What is he doing
How does this have so many likes all I see is cement and a voice talking
Idiots depopulate themselves
As a local of cairns, this dude is as dumb as they come😂😂  There are mutiple signs LEGIT at every boat ramp, bridge crossing, beach, etc.   The fact that he was just like "yeah righto" confirms to me he thinks croc attacks must be just a myth like drop bears sightings🤦‍♂️
Let nature do its thing only way we evolve
Hahaha silly boomer
Imagine dying dressed like that
He wants his Darwin award
The random lady in the distance warning him of the exact same thing 😂😂
here in Texas we swim with alligators
Only Australians know what the “yeah righto” means
Darwin enters the chat.
Dum dum
so many busy bodies in this world.
This is why tourists die in australia
Why are u putting the camera on the concrete. Let us see the crocs. 😮
Hate the Aussie accent
Dressed like a floating Smurf.
Entering ANY body of water in Australia is sheer insanity 😂😂 you cant even put your shoes straight on down there ffs lol, you better turn them upside-down and check for spiders first homeslice 👀😬
Its natural selection
Natural selection
I’m surprised this isn’t illegal in Australia they use to be so awesome idk what happened give ur people back guns and lower cigarette prices
No croc would be caught dead eating a smurf.
Eh, just leave the guy alone… he will win his own Darwin Award soon
Darwin Award
How did he manage to reach old age 😂
Any normal Aussie knows Nth Qld you dont swim in the ocean lol
Natural selection at work.
Why help him?
Wouldn't say anything if he didn't care.❤
Bloke or dope
Darwinism at its finest......🤯🤯
Let darwinism do its job.
Darwinism in action
If you are in Australia and near a puddle, your life expectancy just dropped to seconds.
What the fk was he even doing wearing a bright blue, full body wetsuit paddling around in tropical waters on a kneeboard?
This is definitely a fellow testing the boundaries of Natural Selection.  Hey if he doesn’t make it then we have one less of the human male species in the mating pool!  Not sure he may even be up for a Darwin Award!
Look at this guy. What is he wearing?
Why is someone getting in the water in Australia?! They have crocs and poisonous everything.
"you call that a knife?" 🤠
Donut
Listen to the locals you idiot!
Getting into a Salty's domain on a hydro slide or kneeboard, a surfboard, even a kayak is like playing Russian roulette with only ONE open cylinder. NO WAY!!!
I went to Florida and walk right through a pond full of crocks! I had no idea 😂😂
😂😂😂
At least get a crocodile float lol
Look how he is dressed. Common sense isn’t that guys thing ever.
When I arrived in Australia, I avoided the beach, ocean, bush, desert, rivers, lakes, streams, swamps.  I didn't get to see any of the natural wonders but I'm still alive.
He's a European who failed to recognise the signs written in Austraylyan. 😁
Bets on the tourist nationality? As an American—I’m guessing American.
What a flog 😂😂😂
hahaha i love aussies they're the friendliest people on the planet ❤
Some people have an undeniable death wish
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it.” Periodt
Australians are my favourite type of human
Natural selection 😂
If TWO Aussies are warning you about danger, you're about half from death. Half a day, half an hour, or half a minute, take your pick.
100-to-1 odds buddy's an American.
any updates on this guy? is he still paddling around haha
Yeah righto 😬
If the crock approaches you, declare he is not really there because of the sign.
While he’s dressed like a giant soft plastic bait, an actual human lure, what a peanut 🥜
Please don’t say anything and just record
Just another superb example of stupidity at its purest.  Crocs, have at it! 🐊 🍖 🥩
I am not rooting for him
Did he die?
I love how these folks look after each other and acutally show concern and anger towards the man for putting his life in danger. It shows they are concerned for others lives.
Bro if any Australian warns me about wildlife, I'll promptly admit I'm wrong and get tf out of where I'm at.
This is the way life is supposed to be. People like this shouldn't be in the gene pool. Natural selection at it's finest.
Always listen to the locals !!!
When he said have some common sense. That was all I need to hear
Wow wow wow 😮
Crocs be like, "man sssshhhh🤫 don't tell him".
DARWINISM
I just came here for the comments, they do not dissapoint😂😂
At least that’s one dumb person less in the world,right?
You come here, you follow our rules. It's your obligation to find out and the passport entry conditions these dropkicks sign says so. It's also their accountability, not ours and our crocs have all the environmental protections
I wouldn't say a word
Well thank god we got to see it
Brits need to go back to England.
Agreed. Croc grabs this Dude and there should be zero intervention. Not as if it will matter. If a Nile was in that water?
I’m Australian , normally we get tourists doing this crazy kind of thing , but, is that an Aussie on the paddle board too? He gotta be on drugs 😂
What's worse is the bloke sounds like he's Australian 😵
Crocodiles love the taste of dementia
Bro’s wearing crocs while talking about crocodiles
Good on you for telling him!!!
I wonder the fate of the Smurf all these months later.
Fawkawf
Wt effin ****t
Where have you been for the last 1000 years😂😂😂    he's entitled, he can do whatever he wants🎉
That Dkhead is probably from Melbourne 😂😂
Would have let Darwin take control there
I guess he's there to fk spiders 😂😂
The bro is trying to bend in with the water
Out of sight out of mind
Let the idiot 😂 be 😅
When you’re the only person in Australia swimming at a beach, definitely question your sense when going into that water…
If you live in the South(USA) or northern Australia, you can always tell if there’s crocs or gators in the water. The first clue is if you go to the lake, stick your finger I. The water and if it comes out to be wet, that’s a sign there’s a croc or gators in the water!
We dont need idiots like this in our gene pool. Let the crocs have him and enjoy the show.
where's the happy end?
Clown
What Exactly Did The Paddleboarder Say?
Winning a Darwin Award in northern Australia is impressive.
He's got his stinger suit on... All good mate.
Asian…
North Queensland, pretty croc central, why on earth would you be so careless.
Proof that not everyone trying to stop your fun is a Karen.
As a scientist, I love seeing evolution at work.
I have been fishing at this place many times, I can recognise the boat docking place because of the rocks and surroundings. I can confirm it is well known for having a lot of crocs.
YouKnowYPPL 😊
You know whats hilarious hes wearing a full JellyFish sting suit
Do your thing just don't scream for help when you're getting chopped in pieces.
At least he is wearing a stinger suite hahaha
Does anyone know If the man was OK in the end?
Shami
Natural selection keep ya mouth shut let it take its course. Have a good day.
Florida man meets Australia man.
Was on a cruise met some Aussies great people they wanted me to come visit I said no bc Im not going anywhere with salties. Told me they're just in North Queensland but I still respectfully declined 😅
I love Australian peoples' accent.
Well, he’s cooked.
That guy has to be suicidal. Why would you not listen to the locals?
This guy knows exactly the danger he’s in. He’s got a blue suit and a white board to be as Camouflaged as possible. If he gets got, he gets got. 🤷‍♂️
Do we have an update?! Is a crock tooth picking Smurf body suit from his teeth?!
Did he actually ask where is the sign? Goodness gracious. I’m sorry sometimes you have to leave people to their own fates. You can try you can explain you can be very logical and honest they will not get it. Give up and go and have a great day.  I would’ve been totally grateful for a pointer like this if I had overseen the signs. Some egos are just too big. This was a really good one thank you for filming it 😂😂😂
Those aren’t swamp puppies. They are fkn dinosaurs..  Fun Fact: Crocodiles are the one animal that has actively viewed humans as a source of food throughout our existence.
Ohmygosh tiny little surfboard too not even a paddle board
Let it be. It’s called Darwinism
buddy is a croc expert, just look at his feet.
some peoples survival instincts are non existent
This guys is a big fish...it's a good day for the salties that day.
how i wish it was this idiot instead of the little girl in another clip.
Darwin Award winner 😅
Mindless old boomer probably rides a bicycle too
Good that you warn him and he don't have any excuses for being killed by a Crocodile.
What an idiot. Listen to the locals!
But aren't Crocs in Australia forbidden to attack foreigners?
Let natural selection play itself out.
This guy is a fkn idiot! Whata sausage!
I wish there was more know about that weird little knee paddles gnome
We need to stop slaughtering animals when morons like this make themselves bait!!! Sharks specifically have already had their populations and food sources DECIMATED! If people want to be willfully ignorant, STOP killing to wildlife for their willful stupidity !!!! The worlds probably better off without their lack of respect regardless 🫡
Probably an American 🤦‍♀️
I mean i get why his getting annoyed... I'd been too if someone was trying to warn me to save my life😫
This is probably the craziest video I’ve ever seen. More croc than water.
Cool boat floor "Brah" 😂 why don't you learn how to film a video 😂
Dude warns guy about crocs, while wearing crocs. Thanks again, simulation!
If a guy who sounds like he’s best friends with a kangaroo tells you get out the water you get out the water no questions asked
touron.
lol hear is serious in hisvoice lol
Pride is one helluva drug..
Crocodile defends the man’s right to be eaten
Is there more of this video? 😅
A Floridian telling this paddleboarder about gators.
Soon as the camera cut the crocodile said "showtime"
You can see a camouflaged croc at the very bottom of the video at the end 0:10 😂😂
He's probably American and Maga cult.
Exactly common sense
You guys don't need him in society anymore. The fact he's made it this far is  insane
It's crazy to me that when these folks are literally trying to save this guy's life he cops an attitude.
Let you do your thing? That would have been the end of the conversation
Should you A. Trust the locals B. Hold onto your own ego C. Not even be in this situation in the first place
Let the guy live his best life!  Then snap! Make sure you got it for YouTube and you’re set for life!
Dude is actually hunting to assassinate a croc. Immediately he asked where the signs are, thats where they going to be at probably.
Natural selection
Im not from Australia but even I know this really is one of the dumbest things you can possibly do over there. 😂
What a croc block
Smurfs think they’re invisible 😂🤣😂
Story says, man in blue body suit on a paddle board gone missing, never to be seen again.
Never listen to someone wearing Crocs. They clearly don't know what they're talking about.
ITS THE DAY OF MY LUCKY!
Croc, leave my dinner alone.
They should put a "Aussie Warning" sign.
Tasmanian
Did he get eqten?
Probably a Dan Andrews voter
Ocean Nazis are what we call these fakas.
When the Aussie says you’re crazy, you’re crazy.
Natural selection
Some people never get the chance to have 20/20 hindsight.  This guy is likely proof of that.
& he’s on a paddle board..? 😮‍💨 nah he had a death wish 😂
Call the fuzz and record the arrest
I won't even swim in ocean waters , or just water I cant see under
Did the guy got eaten or he got lucky?
This is like forigners in Norway going for montain hiking in t shirts and frees to death. Please always listen to locals. Stay humble and live.
No need for the cursing and foul language!
_"One there, one there and one over there!"_  -- best part by far.
I get the feeling this guy might be on the local news for a bad reason someday
Most surprising is to see native English speakers in Australia.
Natural selection at its finest
Idiot! The problem is, is that if the crocodile eats him. The crocodile gets hunted down & killed. It's not fair to the crocodile 😡
Leave the Natural Selection do its thing
Hey salties need food too mate
If an Australian is concerned about an animal you know you messed up going in their territory
I've never even set foot once in Australia, and even I have heard that basically everything north of Cairns is saltwater croc country. 😂 This guy is crazy. I wouldn't even dip a toe in a pond anywhere in Australia if I haven't asked at least a few locals if it's safe.
Stupidity is stupidity!!
This is exactly the problem with half and he world today. You trying to save them from the dangers out here and they literally mad at you for trying to help them...they call you a liar.
Just let the gene pool cleanse itself 😂
Most of the water around Australia but mostly top and bottom but bullsharks and crocs top end and big great whites down the bottom,especially around Phillip island where I live at a place called seal rock. All the fishing boats drop the old bait overboard on the way past. Look up vic hislop great white shark, see how big they get.
At April 28, man in Phillipines had trespass on crocodile enclosure in zoo - he was severely injured but he is alive, ridiculous thing is he sued a zoo as he was thinking it was a... Sculpture. People are d%mb as sh=t.
That's Filthy Frank
Natural Selection at work
I didn’t think swimming was advised outside of a swimming pool in Australia.
The crocs obviously don't like junk food that's why he isn't being devoured
I hope he doesn’t have offspring. Literally taking us back to the stone ages 😂
And the aquatic smurf was never seen again
Natural selection
he was not- fully aware of it
The news would read, "Unprovoked croc attack."
How about minding your own business mate?
I kinda agree with the paddle boarder. Thanks for letting me know, now move on.
When the Aussie is nervous… We all are!
Sometimes you gotta sit back and let natural selection do its thing. Charles Darwin would be proud of both of these men. 😂
What an idiot he wants to die
As a Floridian, this dude should listen to these local folks and get the heck out of that water.
Videos like this make me so mad lol
Yeah he's crazy but it's not always dangerous. I've swam at Daily river bridge NT with my boss his wife and 8yr old kid we could see crocs but we were safe also seen 4m croc on beach in Millingimbi Arnhem land NT in the morning then the kids were swimming in the same spot that afternoon just gotta know the area and the habits and have respect
Whats he doing paddling on his knees for anyways 😂
I'm not sure if Salties eat Smurfs ;)
Dont blame tha croc when you get done by it 😭🤦🏻
🙏🏻❤️❤️
I wouldn't dip my toe in a puddle in Australia. This man is a lunatic.
I cant make out the guys accent.. Is he from U.K. or USA? I live in USA, we have a LOT of dumb uckers as well as UK.
Sadly, most Australians cannot read signs.
Now see if you waited sround and recorded him getting ate would you still be a bad guy for recording it ? Why didn't you help him. ? LOL 😅
Love that the Local is wearing Crocs.😂
When the Australian man says  “You’re in North Queensland man have some common sense”   you should probably listen. Australia isn’t the place to *not* have it
They pulled a 12 foot gator a mile from my house. It's best not to go swimming when you don't know.
He’s tired of living
To be fair, the guy is from Florida and the crocodile is more afraid of him.
Whoever officiates the Darwin awards needs to kick this guy out for spectator interference.
If only the UK waters had them
When you go south on Queensland you'll end up in Virginia.
Dude has a Death Wish
Just have natural selection happen
Let that smurf figure it out himself
Nah what the heck man I’m in Alabama and even I know not to go in that water. That guy is legit crazy.
What an idiot.
The worlds full of ‘em. He gave him fair warning at least.
When an Aussie warns about dangerous wildlife I listen.
Natural selection
The irony is the guy wearing crocs while warning the Smurf about Crocodiles 🐊 being in the ocean 😂😂
Unbelievable!
A crocodile wearing a fake mustache comes along and says let the man do whatever he wants!
😮
If people stopped interfering, then nature would take its course. Then we’d have less of these morons.
Wow- this  is proof of how badly the "jean pool has degraded". He's the epideme  of a "garden verity halfwit"!
Darwin Award unlocked!
Crocs are Spoon fed by people like these
I'm Texan. And I'm amazed at the stupidity of a lot of the population. They don't believe you when told danger. Gaters, bore, bob cats and bull sharks in the rivers and some lakes.
Bro im aussie and this man is seriously dumb
Let me do my thing.   Ok.   Helllllppppppppppppp!!!!!   Nah I’ll let you do your thing
I agree with the other commenters when in Australia if an Australian yells stop what you’re doing. In translation it means I’m trying to save your life.  It’s best to listen.
I kept getting a anxious feeling cause of the water
Dressed for his funeral as a smurf..😂
I'm sorry..BUT that accent and that advice equals DO WHAT HE SAY TO DO...😂😂😂😂TF
You heard the man!  Let him do his thing! 😂
Stupidity of man knows no bounds, and the way he is so confident and arrogant at the same time
An Aussie shouting at you - is on par with that shirt reading: _"I'm a bomb technician, if you see me running, try to keep up."_
Anything south of north Carolina stay outa the water you can't seen in... if it's wet....... there in there, everywhere..😂 but yea just keep swimming and other guy keep filming.. people love to see videos like that..I doooo😂
He remembered his stinger suit 😂
it’s australia, don’t go in the water, on the land, in the territory, or in the continent whatsoever mate (coming from an aussie)
The Aussies will show you the way to safety. I never question them.  Furthermore, I believe this poor sod has intentionally chosen 💀
Darwin at work...
He looks older to, how has he survived this long 😅
If he was a young guy you should have just let him go. We do t need those genes in the gene pool.
When an Australian tells you, "it's not safe." You LISTEN!
Why is this so funny 😂😂😂
Go ahead mate I'll probably see you on the TV News
Always listen to the locals in areas of safety especially when they warn you to look out for the drop bears
Dude, if someone with australian accent warns me about wildlife i pay all the attention i have available. Like you really wanna bet when the possible outcome is getting snatched from below and ripped appart while drowning?
Go ahead mate go do what you wanna do.. 😂  Guys like he's gunna learn the hard way as if he's talking to a silly kid...😂😅
I smell a Darwin Award for this fantastic display of human arrogance and stupidity.
Candidate for the Darwin Awards.
If someone wearing crocs is warning you about crocs, you better listen.
What’s wrong with people?! If an Australian told me Don’t do anything I’m listening to them! They live in one of the most dangerous countries if not the most dangerous.
Well, they warned him.
Id sooner swim in Alligator infested waters than a lake with only 1 crocodile in it! Never mind croc infested waters lol
Something I find odd is when people say shark infested waters or crocodile infested waters, like, usually they were there first? Just something I thought was odd.
...Upcoming recipient for a Darwin Award
Stop trying to talk that crocodiles dinner out of delivering itself to him!
To a tourist, this isn't common sense that it's croc territory. People should learn how to talk to others in a way that isn't condescending
I would say if there are signs and you purposely disregard them. He shouldn't argue with him trying to save him. Let him win the Darwin awards. This guy can't be saved. He will do some other crazy stunt in the future and will be done anyway
Crazy hobbie..👍🍻
🤣🤣🤣 Do what you want to do, but don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it 🤣🤣 facts
Go ahead would’ve been the last thing I said to him
Sounds like ya mate is a tad restarted. Crocs don't care, free food is free food. 😂
Oh well, if he ends up re emerging from several crocodile rectums.......as the local said "don't blame the crocodiles.
I bet croc's were looking forward to the smurf on a paddle board special 😂
Don’t blame the crocodile 🐊 😅
Bro code dictates that bro1 should warn bro 2 yes but if bro1 wants to be eaten then so be it .. random pancake emoji I just found 🥞
Bros also on a surfboard 😂
Australian and African crocodiles make our American alligators and American crocodiles look tiny.
Dude be like " I don't believe in the concept of crocodiles..."
Did he die?
Croc bait😂
"crocodile infested"? Who is not supposed to be there?
Always respect a Aussie warning ⚠️ for wildlife mate. There's no reason they are casually afraid or skittish to this sort of thing. So, if they say you can get done by a Croc, being Crocs can crush a human head like a plump grape 🍇 and they don't have to be particular that big to get a human especially in water. In my case, I'm QUICKLY getting out bruh. Respect those animals they are relentless and ambush masters and apex predators. Wake up bruh. ☠️😬.
Some people have zero brain cells
If an Aussie ain't doing it, I was out hours ago.
I wish someone like that would have been around to yell at me when I went kayaking in north Queensland! I probably got lucky! This freaks me out!
Thinks he’s at Disney
well kind of understand the swimmer if he american he can't be use to someone trying to help him. most people in the usa would have just pull out their cell phone and wait. lol
What are crocodiles the one deadly animal that Aussies actually fear?
Alway idiot's
Natural selection let it happen 😂😂😂😂
The man talking is wearing crocs and his shadow looks like  crocodile. I didn't see any crocodile 🐊 in the water😂😂
I can see a couple of crocs on the concerned man's boat already. Nobody is safe
never heard an Aussie concerned about safety tbh, must be really serious stuff this guy riskin here.
Its good to have confidence but confidence with no discernment is called arrogance. And arrogance in crocodile territory is called natural selection 😂
Yup
old C
Let the crocs eat, mate 🙄
Wise man learns from the mistakes of others .. I am that wise man 😌
That groan he let out when that lady in the background started whining is the most bloke thing ever 😂
And when the croc eats him, the croc gets killed for the person's stupidity
Just natural selection at work...lol...
This never gets old 😂
The aussie as like most he's really nice an just saying in his aussie way..listen dude, odds of you dieing today are pretty good..be safe out there mate..😂🫣🫶
Thats exactly what happens  Humans mess up and in the end the animal gets shot
In Louisiana we will warn you once that there are huge gators where people have river bars after that it's lawn chairs and popcorn for the rest of us
Mental. What an idiot
dont tell pikmin what to do
The crocs aare cursing this man for taking their meal away
Bro has a death wish
At least the water is kind of cloudy, so he can keep believing it's all hunky-dory right up till the crushing and the thrashing and the whole jurassic park experience.
What a Freakin’ idiot!  I was in northwestern AUS last March, and I saw Croc warning signs everywhere. Crocs can lunge 1/2 their body length, and they can sense where you are on the bank even when they’re submerged and you can’t see them.   All warning signs said to stay a minimum of 5 - 7 feet back from the water’s edge.
Look at that idiot. Lol
The way crocs can jump out of the water, the guy on that boat could have been snatched while giving that warning. Just sayin'
Remove all warning signs and lables a.s.a.p.
Retards are everywhere I guess
Natural selection
"Me and Jesus are watching you" said the parrot from that king billy coke bottle track.
just wait ... darwin will get em
I know mate tell them mate there’s crocodiles everyone here okay that’s why I never swim out in the salt water because crocodile will be there because third black skin camouflage is squid model and they gorgeous
In America those in the country we call them city people. The children learning dangers in the country by relatives  dont like being compared to city because city sometimes dont listen and considered dumb city kids.
Australians regularly live around some of the most dangerous creatures on the planet. If one of the locals is giving you a warning take heed to it.
It’s water.  In Australia    Where’s more dangerous
What a bell end.  The guy is trying to save your life
You wouldn't catch me in the water in North Queensland. I remember hearing about the guy who had his head taken by a croc when i was a kid.
Where’s that guy from?
Risks his life in crocodile infested waters but felt compelled to get vaccinated three times for Covid….
They need a sign ?! Isn’t it common knowledge ?! 🤦‍♂️
Why is the guy dressed like Tingle from Zelda?
At this point, it's just Darwinism
European Tourists...
By all means, allow nature to take it's course.
I saw a 12 year old boy swimming in the lake behind my house in Florida. I ran out there and told him that I had seen several alligators and many venomous stakes in that lake. He said "I'll be fine." I said, "But when the alligator starts pulling you under, then I'm going to have to save you, and that's not fair to me because I'm warning you right now!" He laughed and got out of the lake. Thankfully I saw him around the neighborhood many more times, but he never swam in the lake again.
Natural selection.
Just stay out of the water when your in Australia simple 😂
That guy must be from florida. He thinks all the water lizards are alligators
lol what an idiot
He looks insane tbh.
Never, ever interfere with natural selection.
seems like natural selection
Dressed like a fish as well for some reason...
Just let natural selection do it's thing.
Take notice of the locals ,they know ,they will save your life .
Future Darwin Award winner
Keep videoing, and you'll eventually get 100 million views from this clown
Grew up in Southern Australia and as a kid I watched a documentary on salt water crocs. The first scene was of a woman watching about 5 kids swim right next to a crocodile warning sign. I remember commenting that maybe she thinks she has too many children
He's using his rear end to think since his brain seems to be on vacation! 😡
If F around and find out was a person😅
Where the part 2?
😂
I don't see any crocodiles in the water?
This needs to be shown to bob katter
What nationality is the Smurf on the board?  I can’t tell from his accent….
The guy on the board was rude. Never seen a rude Aussie before.
Guy: I prayed before getting in the water. Croc: I pray before eating.
These people are allowed to vote smh
Leave the man alone karen
Florida has to do the same thing. Smh 👀
Wow I'd be out not argue
You can quite literally see one to his peft
If an Aussie tell you that you’re nuts then you should seriously consider that 😂
That Smurf guy is such a Wally.  🏊‍♂️🐊🍔
human jitterbug
The common sense of some people...
He's splashing around in croc infested waters telling an Australian to mind his own business 😂😂😂
The crics just waiting for him to get too far out😂😂😂😂 then it's playtime
He cant blame nothing when he gets done
Long Pig Platter.
Was this guy aiming to win a Darwin Award?
Let him win the darwin award hes after 🏆
Lol
I appreciate the warning what a nice man😊
His plan was to tell the crocodile it was just a prank and point at the camera man
Now, I dont live round gators or crocs...but doesnt disturbing the water to do things like paddle that board attract them?
is that a teletubby?
Not me automatically falling off the board when I hear him shouting this 😂😂🐊🍴
3 *PEOPLE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER CORRECT* 1} Someone You *DO NOT* Love. 2} Someone Who *WILL NOT LISTEN* 3} Someone *NOT UNDER YOUR CONTROL*
Giant blue sausage says what?
There is a reason we have Darwin Awards.
Lots of people don't understand this in FL in either.  NO GOING INTO FRESHWATER EVEN A PUDDLE. The gators are everywhere and even be on your guard in saltwater
Hmmmm, save the guy or make a great YouTube/TicTok video on things you don’t do in Australia 🤣👍
Let him find out.
This a global problem.  When I lived in the Pacific NW in the US.  I would visit one of our National Parks and what people ignore the signs and climb over the barrier wall or fence to take a selfie or look over the cliff edge, not realizing that the whole area that they were standing on could give way at anytime and that it was 1000 ft drop to certain death.
These are the type that get taken, tourists and hermits.
He's special, he's different
What a muppett!
Fate in action. Beyond logic.
is that a smurf?
Obviously a Palestinian flag waving Karen in his daytime job , no sense , unable to take the truth for what it is ...only believes what the little red socialist book tells him to believe ...well done to the guy giving him it as straight as it comes ...
Never interrupt Darwin when he is working.
A Darwin Award contender waiting to claim his prize!
my friends this is called natural selection
I love the way the man on the dock is so calm while he tells the idiot on the board about the crocs.
As an Aussie, I can assert that this guy has the survival skills of a largish ornamental garden pebble.
I can barely make him out, is that a Dutch accent?
Some idiots are told by rangers but they refuse to listen. They become a tasty morsel for saltwater crocs.
Every interaction these days seems to involve some level of aggression from one  party or the other . What a shame this guy’s warning message was seen as an unwelcome flex on the other guy’s freedoms!
" i am fully aware of it,where are the signs?"😂
Some people you have to leave to their own vices/stupidity because the man on the boat 🚤 ramp was genuinely trying to help him. He’s so arrogant thinking🤔💭he’s just saying something because he doesn’t want me on my little styrofoam surf🏄🏼‍♂️ board. 🤦🏽‍♂️ 🏄🏼‍♂️🐊😂🤣😮‍💨
Must be a politician
How did that fool get to his age
Crocs arent scared of you like their cousins alligators. You can even get away with paddling with sharks but crocs are a different story
I didnt even know crocodiles swam in the ocean.
I’m assuming this is an arrogant, ignorant American tourist, that is immune (like most Americans) from education!
Darwin Award winner right there
How ignorant when someone is literally trying to save you but that’s society today. Everyone has a problem with everyone. Sigh**
The awful country of Australia.
Morons in Australia
Hand paddling in Australia ??? He has to be daft !
In Australia any body of water where an adult human can be submerged always assume theres a croc inside so always exercise extreme caution and use common sense at all times 🤷🏽‍♂️
please tell me he got to his senses and got on the boat
Skippy get outta the water. 😂  He was just trying to help him not d13
😁
Imagine needing a sign in order to avoid being eaten by a regional predator? 😂
Why is the world full of iDiOtS? 😮‍💨
*HAVE SOME COMMON SENSE*
Pilgrim issues 😂😂😂😂
You can’t do anything or go anywhere in Australia without the risk of being attacked by something deadly. Sharks are bad enough but you’ve got crocodiles ASWELL!!
I thought he was a crocodile 🐊 snack.😅
Darwin
Another smart Gen Z-ero clown you gotta be the dumbest generation ever
Crocodiles need to eat too, stop being so rude😂
I have one rule when traveling... If the locals wont go, then neither will I
Why did you blurr that dodo birds face? I have to know who this genius is!!!
I did not know that crocodiles lived in the ocean
IDIOT . This is the type of people we should take warning lables off for
I wonder when his funeral is I can only assume he was eaten
idiot alert
As someone who fishes often and see crocks regularly I live up the top end this is out there any thing around there would not turn down a meal crazy
He's got a stinger suit on, in legit croc INFESTED waters😂😂😂he's worried about jellyfish😂😂😂😂
What an idiot
Don't swim in the crocodiles' refrigerator 😂
Why did you warn him? Just record what happens lol
What a dichead
Should have let him be and let Darwin's Theory play out.
I do understand there is alot of wildlife that is dangerous in the beautiful "Land Down Under"...but it always boils down to the most dangerous thing of all: stupidity.
This is a man when when he see's a "wet paint" sign, he has to touch it to make sure.
YeahNah you’re a wanka mate n ya mum shoulda swallowed… is what this Aussie chic would yelled 🤣🤘
Imports
The funniest part of this is the camera man is wearing crocs
He is basically asking to get eaten
Great camera work
Darwinism, I’m voting for the croc
This dude on the shore does not understand. This fella on the board is a customer of The Smurf Euthanasia Group and he is doing what he paid for.
No Lifeguard sign means don’t try to save his life my friend! Suicide comes in all sorts of forms
Wow, what a drop kick🤣. Just let natural selection happen
We’ve had this exact same type of conversations with tourists in Florida.  We don’t swim in brackish water.. alligators are everywhere, and yes, crocodiles too. Cottonmouths too.
Pommie accent.
Darwin Award goes to the smurf retardotron
Natural selection…🙄🤷‍♂️
The entire country of Australia is one huge warning sign
I don't care where I am. If am Aussie tells me not to go swimming. Even if it's in my pool. I ain't going in
Aussies are pretty brazen about nature so if an Aussie is scared you should be scared
Natural selection
I need to see a what happened next? Did he immediately get out or did he continue paddling on his knees? 😂
being old doesnt make u smart. Its just concept teached and as u can see dude like 60s with brain of 9 years
I like that you gave him "permission".  The planet needs less of these Muppets!
Crazy As an Aussie I approve this message
Natural selection.
We literally have a Rip current in Australia called Backpackers Rip because so many tourists get caught in it. They never listen to the signs.
Just paddling off from the boat ramp on a little dinner tray 😂
At this point, it's survival of the fittest 😂😂😂
😮Is this for real.
Why is he dressed like a teletubby?
Slapping the water with your hands is music to a croc’s ears they hear that miles away, it’s like a beautiful lady in a red dress playing with her hair staring at a man and saying come get some big daddy.
Darwin Award waiting to be given
Even the Australian ain't messing with those waters lol
The stupidity have also a fee to pay
You should always listen to a man talking about crocs whilest wearing crocs.
I’m an Australian crocodile hunter, I can assure you that he is safe in that blue suit.
Natural selection
Naah..leave him alone.. its a free world!!
1000+ a year get killed by salt and Nile and the American alligator.
let the democrat do what he wants lol
Darwin “natural selection”😂
Im so here for the comment section 😂😂😂
Must be a tourist
And on a little paddle board no less.  Yeesh!  That's a Darwin Award worthy move.
This is when I let Darwin do the talking
The bloke wants to play with the croc. Leave him be.
Imagine ignoring the Aussie that defends his life from nature and God knows what and then seeing a Croc…yeah you’re why they make movies
Darwing award
mmmm Yummy, Tourist.
Eff em… the one time we’re I recommend recording rather than helping.
Snap
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it" who's he going to tell King Yenma?
Exhibit A of when pride is the death of ya.
Only .4 humans are killed by crocs each year.  This guy likes them odds.
What a nosy guy.  If he wants to swim with crocks let him; I kayaked in gator infested waters a lot with no problem; wildlife are not evil. They don’t even like to eat humans. We probably taste like garbage. Since we eat everything like rats
The man on the paddle board is trying to save you, mate. The croc will eat him first so you have time to get away. Be a little grateful for that, instead of yelling at him. Please.
Dont have this problem in Kent
People that believe in evolution all should get Darwin awards.
signs at the ramps are in multiple languages usually with a picture of a croc, locals usually add a bit of local knowledge with a marker, like, get in, get eaten!
Dudes trying to safe your life.. lose your ego and thank him
Not that I'm a croc or anything....but leave the man be......please?
And all of them are waiting for him 😂🫡
Idiot: “Where’s the sign?” Hello this is Australia. AND specifically North Queensland. Do you really need a sign??!!
Some lady just got ate by a croc in florida where we have crocs in all waters
Common sense isn't soo common...
Let stoopid be stoopid
Steve Irwin taught me to not even turn on the sink in Australia, crock might pop out and get ya. Actually getting in water is crazy.
You only live there, sir.What would you know. Lol
Crocs don't eat humans, they eat fish
Fkng tourists. Moronic
His blue suit will camouflage him in the water should the crocodile find him. Duhhh. Leave this genius outdoor specimen of a man alone
hasn't in any croc area I can promise you I liveness where is
100% the croc is going to get blamed. They will hunt it due to it being a man eater.
Croc blocked 🐊
He's just going to stay relaxed and talk calmly with the crocodile and ask not to be eaten. It's quite all right
maybe they're nice crocodiles
Another Darwin Award candidate...This is how nature weeds out the idiots in the human gene pool.
And now another episode of "First Time Paddlers in Queensland." ...Part one: Three Smiling Salties!
Australia get your croc numbers under control
Australia is like Florida. Where there’s a body of water there’s going to be a prehistoric dinosaur waiting for a meal to come by. Australia is more dangerous than Florida. Gators won’t typically go out of their war to hunt you a salty however definitely will hunt you I’d feel more safe swimming with a great white than a saltwater crocodile. I’m looking at videos to see if anyone actively swam with one that they do with sharks can’t find one yet. Crocodiles are also far more intelligent than sharks are they also prey on sharks. I’m not swimming with anything that actively preys on sharks other than killer whales/Dolphins.
The recently seen signs are also different to the "normal" estuarine croc signs too, pretty hard to miss/ignore tbh film him getting eaten.
I wouldn't be proud- I'd get out straight away if i were told there were 3 crocs around me 😬
Nothing common about sense
...the boarder was seen later missing an arm....READ ur signs people!!!
If live and let die were a person 🤦🏽‍♀️
This video suks
I’m ozzy - That was the last time Terry was seen in his kiak alive lol
Most clueless Australian. Must be from the south.
Natural selection
I’m just surprised he lived long enough to complete this video!
You are liable to get killed by an animal in the entire Australian continent
Natural selection ❤
Drive 30 mins to port and watch the crocs on the side of the road, recently moved to wa from cairns and yep crocnation there
and because of these people, my crocodile friends didn't get to eat their food.
Total D bag
Some people just seem born to die stupidly
I didn’t know Oompa Loompas knew how to paddle board 🤔
Sounds like me talking to Trump and 'maga' supporters.😂
Australian locals: Keep absolutely still. The croc's vision is based on movement. 🇦🇺 🪃   Knee paddler dude: We're gonna make a fortune with this video. 🏊‍♂️ 🐊
Whats he dressed up like tele tubbie
So I looked up the diet of crocodiles, no mention of stuffs, so don't worry youre good.
What a idiot, crocodiles are killing machines
Like the people that go miles out into the ocean on a friggin kayak and get knocked over by whales and sharks,kinda asking for it.
Hes wearing bright blue so the crocks and bull sharks can see him better. A man of nature! 😂😂
Broo those are wasted breaths. I’d go inside make a bowl of popcorn, grab my lawn chair and enjoy mothers nature show
Good on him for warning that tourist. Must be a tourist. No Aussie would be that oblivious to the dangers of crocs in the Northern Territories. 🐊 😳
I’m a Floridian and I live around crocs & gators but when it comes to Aussie leave me out of it
And he's even wearing Crocs 😂
Needs the cartoon peter pan hook tune with this 😂
I will always assume there’s a crocodile when in Australia.
Darwin Awards contender.
Kb
darwin award incoming...
Love the protection from the jellies but totally ignoring the fact a croc will munch you at any moment... 😂
Ignorance is bliss
That paddler dude is oblivious to the fatal consequences. The consolation no one can sue the authorities if he is killed or injured.
Crocodiles like yep i see a blue costumed idiot for breakfast but that aussie is messing it all up just let him be. 😂🤣😂🤣
Did he survive?
Hey, get 'em out of the gene pool.  These morons shouldn't even be allowed to walk around without carrying a tree to replace the oxygen they're using, let alone reproduce.
FAFO……dude looks like a F_ckn dork. Let him figure it out on his own. People think they are smarter than the locals.
Natural selection.
Imagine he just gets eaten half way through this interaction 😂   DUDE GET TF OUTTA THERE, YOU ATE ON BORROWED TIME ALREADY, SITTIN DUCK!!
I wonder what Happened to this guy his face is blurr so maybe he survived? But from how the Aussie was talking about crocodiles being close and pointing them out idk if he did salt water crocodiles are not really easy to survive against
Crocs: stop educating my food. You've done your part mate. Let him be.
Sshhhh....don't tell him. He's weakening the gene pool
There was a time in history when these smooth brains would barely make it out their front door and they were goners.
I would like the cameraman to follow this blue man please 👀….. 🐊
The title of this video should be called natural selection🤣
Blue power ranger?
I'd listen to the locals. They know what's up, especially in a place like Austrailia.
"EMTs prefer people wear wetsuits. Keeps pieces together"  I'll get out now ...
Darwinism at its finest
😂😂😂
All the videos I’ve seen the people have one thing in common
It’s ok his Australian the croc is scared of him
They need one of those remote control croc heads to scare people from swimming.
Karen are everywhere
Let nature take its course
I remember in Cairns a bunch of teens decided to go swimming at night and all of them except one went back to shore and the one still in the water couldn't be seen because it was so dark and then they heard "The croc got me!" and that teen was found dead
Thin the heard
The crocks are having blue fish for dinner.
having to argue....
25 years ago you could get away with doing this but now crocs are protected  we can't see them doesn't mean they aren't there
Natural selection 🤷‍♂️
Croc "shut up Karen i want lunch"
Shoulda just shrugged your shoulders when he said "leave me to do my thing and you do yours". I woulda just walked away after that remark
can see the crocs health bars coming for him
'I'm fully aware' - then proceeds to ask where the signs are lol
Not sure why they are interfering with this man,  these things usually sort themselves out.  We need less idiots and crocs need to eat.
Crocs rarely attack humans
Evolution in action !   I could see jumping in the water, I cannot see arguing with a local about not swimming with Crocs!
That old man was likr those crocadileees are in this water with me im not in the water with them 😂
When entitlement gets you ate.
People would do this and when they're killed by animals that is clearly in their habitat and for survival, the animal gets killed.
The best part is that hes wearing all blue, they'll never find him
Dude is looking to find out, let him f around
Even more frustrating and scary is that some meatheads like this have children and teach them the same type of hubris. Thankfully I was raised by parents with a healthy respect for the dangers of nature and a healthy fear of danger in general.   I don’t take foolish risks and I certainly never arrogantly and defiantly tell someone to mind their own business when the person is only trying to save me from danger.   The other thing that annoys me about people like this is that they not only risk their life, but they also but others like rescue personnel in grave danger when they have to try and either rescue them, or search for their remains.
He’s auditioning for a job as “ live bait “.
How do you guys use the boat ramps if the crocs occupy them like that? I mean you gotta get in the water to hook and unhook the boat right?
The fact that dude is trying to give em a word to the wise tells me he truly is doing some foolish ish frfr
I wanna visit Australia next year but I’m wondering how I’m gonna cope living in a bee keepers suit all the time 😂
Hey my guy, mind your own business Karen. There's evil out there and you might find yourself a bit to nosy with the Wrong person.
I’m sorry but this guy has an Aussie accent. I’m not saying he’s a local, but the comments will lead you to believe this Smurf is an actual American. Lol 😅
This fella remInds me of the English tool in South Africa. He was told by locals as well as Life Guards not to go swimming due to sightings of a Great White. He acted the same way towards then and went swimming anywsy. Shortly after tbst advice the Life Guards risked their own lives and rescued him. Minus a leg and left fighting for his life. Natural selection at its finest.
Darwin awards runner up for sure
People need to mind their own business. He’s an adult and can decide for himself
When an Aussie says danger...RUN!!!💀
Where there is water there is life. - Or death, depending on circumstances. It goes tenfolds for places like Australia. Even me, a snow-lurker from Norway knows that. 😮
Darwinism, possibly quite literally.
That’s fair go ahead and play in the water but don’t blame the croc when he gets ya don’t wanna hear any crying about it
Knew he was ozzi before i clicked
The guys an idiot
Alligator is slow and lazy like the typical American, crocodile is crazy af and mad at the world, like the average Australian
Keep the cameras rolling! It’s only a matter of time! 😬👍
darwin awards
Siri - who me a picture of "live bait".
Croc: that's my lunch 😂
That's not a knife
Crazy 😂
I don’t understand why an non resident don’t listen to a resident who knows what’s there
Screaming in 3. 2, 1,
When an Aussie tells you to get out of the water due to crocs.... you might want to listen.
“Let me do my thing”   And the croc will also do his thing!
The Aussie to this Aussie is : she’ll be right mate!
I don't see how this knucheaded loser has lived this long.
Darwin award nominee.....I hope he doesn't win it, but....I would watch the video.
Just stay out of all bodies of water in and around Australia!🚩
Sum ppl are just super 😅dumb
Im in canada and i know saltie signs are to be taken seriously
Lass die Frau in Ruhe....das Krokodil freut sich😂😂😂😂😂
Na toll. Und dann blöd aus dem Krokodil maul raus sehen🤪
Same with gators in southeast Texas. Never go in at the boat ramp.
Part 2??
Give the warning, rest is on them.
Oh he's talking about the camera man's shoes 👞
3 signs within meters of each other should give you a sign of somthing
Let natural selection take its course.
I would have just ask who do we need to contact when you're dead because it's going to happen 20 foot saltwater crocs don't care if it's a fish or a man they don't have taste buds all they know is food.
So is he still alive this day? Or did the croc show up?
Same In Every water body in Florida except brackish
Good for you for warning the fool.
I remember going to Fraser Island. We were specifically warned about not going into the sea, especially in one particular area.  A few decided to rebel and go there anyway. They saw a few fins and immediately got out.  They really thought it was like their mums not telling them to do something and not a genuine warning of real danger.
Dont blame the crocodile 😂😂
You can’t save people from themselves
Id hang around just to not miss the show. Some things are just inevitable.
Let Nature take it's course, nothing of value will be lost and the croc won't be hungry for a couple of days.
If I here a bunch of Steve Erwin’s talking about it’s dangerous I’m out 😂
lol probably some dude from California
Blue origin training ground.
Darwin award winner soon.
Bet he's maga
Yeah righto. 😂
Why bother....  People are so ignorant, let them do their mistakes and see what happens. 😁

Shhhhhhh Natural selection ‼️😅🤣😂
That guy would have voted for Trump.
And the Darwin Award winner is…..

How did survival of the fittest not claim this fool in childhood?
Unbelievable !! I wouldn't take a chance like that 😲😳
Your evil you tube
Just let natural selection happen 🤷
Dinosaurs in there and hes being dumb about it
I was in a large lake swimming to an island when a guy on a jet ski with an Australian accent asked what I was doing and that my head looked like a buoy. He insisted I get on and he took me back to shore. He then and went to pick up my friend who was hard of hearing. When my friend got back he said, I didn't hear or understand what that guy was saying... What the f_ck was that about? I explained to him. I believe the accent and look of concern made me not question him.
I'm with the paddling dude.  Keep your know-it-all trap shut and leave him alone.
Everyone should be AWARE there are salt water crocodiles in AUSTRALIA!!!
Crocs got to eat to mate. Leave the mobile dumb food alone.
She'll be right mate🤣🤣🤣
Morons like this don't deserve warnings.
I love how this man I defending the crocodiles
These saltwater crocs will absolutely demomish you.
If it was up to me there would be NO CROCS or any other dangerous animals any where near any place humans congregate to enjoy the outdoors.
I love darwinism
Just saw a clip from Costa Rica a croc with a young man in its mouth just chugging along.
You know, I actually would have figured on Aussies regarding this sort of thing as more of a betting sport than any cause for concern. Oh, right. Wetsuits aren't good for the croc's guts.
What on gods green earth is that crocodile snack wearing!?
This the type of personality that goes to live with grizzly bears to protect them in a national park
This the type of personality that goes to live with grizzly bears to protect them in a national park
Idiot so many accidents can be avoided😅😅😅😅got to be british
Natural selection
What a drongo
What is he wearing?  😳
When people remove themselves from the gene pool we call it the Darwin Award.
Well tell that to the guys who run around bare feet? But good on you though for saying something. Sorry.
I was in far North QLD in croc country, just past Cairns actually, and saw these German backpackers waist deep in water having a splash fight right near a boat ramp, in the shadow of crocodile warning signs.  We told them to get out of the water, but they were oblivious to the danger they were in.  We fully expected to see them on the news, because they just had no idea unfortunately.
British ahh HAHAH
It’s surprising how many people get taken by crocs up north
This man has a hot date with his future. He forgot to bring the flowers.
Lucky that isn't africa. There wouldn't be much talking😂😂😂
im an aussie and salties ARE NOT TO BE MESSED WITH
Darwin Award goes to the smurf on the knee board
Did he get eaten alive?
All other accents, I would have told them to fo as well. But an aussie?? Only proper response is "aye mate, I understand"
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it" most Aussie statement ever 😂
I’m hoping you saved his life. While he was clearly defensive in the beginning, it could have been because of previous people maybe harassing an old man. But clearly he didn’t know about the signs… it sounded like once you mentioned the signs he wasn’t so defensive. Very kind of you to still stop and inform the man. ❤
Alas, poor Yorik. I knew him well...
Btw these are the kind of dudes who get injured and then demand emergency personnel drop anything going on in their life to save them.
You can’t put in what God left out.
Don't blame the crocodile when u get dun by it 😂😂
Natural selection. Perfect example......
That must be a liberal Australian
Y’all live in Jumanji
liberal logic
Natural selection at its finest..just let him be
People.  Jesus let him go. Dude can wrap himself in bacon and cheese for all I care. WILD 😮😅
Im from rural usa and i know salt water crocodiles are no joke, what an idiiot 😂
That's a cyclist who found water, the spandex gives it away,  they believe they always have right of way, let him argue with a 9 foot salty
stop interfering with natural selection. pff common sense? where?
let me do my thing
Weak!
Maybe he has bonded with the crocodiles and they are not going to harm him.
THAT MUST BE A LIBERAL OUT THERE...
back in the day ONE MAN would shout this and that would be that. He would do what he wanna do regardless.
Stop interrupting natural selection. The world is already “Idiocracy” playing out. Let nature take its course. This is how extreme stupidity spreads. Let the crocs do their job to “slow the spread”. 🤷‍♂️
I’ve been in croc country. There are certain rivers literally swarming with crocodiles. The water writhes with crocodiles. If there’s not enough for them to eat, they eat each other.
i went to NZ for some weeks...thought to visit Aussieland... i decided not to, i had met some racist Aussies in Singapore.... so my interest to meet more of those idiots been very limited!
If the Australian is telling you to get out. Its probably best to get out 😂😂
😆 🤣  yo it's like swimming in south fl good luck 👍
Natural selection at its finest
If the aussie proceeds with caution. Follow suit.
Thats a very austrailian sentence.  Dont blame the croc when you get done by it.
if you had common sense you would not be in North Queensland LOL
Im from Michigan and a bunch of my family is from Florida ive been to Florida i cant tell you how many times. Same thing as this video if people who live there tell you not to play in the water listen. Ive seen aligators and  crocodiles in water youd drive your bike through where i live in Michigan.
You could just let him get eaten and not let it bother you
Pride has taken over the world
Hey Joe, look.   It's food delivery in a blue wrapper.
I would be saying thank God you told me and I was so dumb as to not do a little research.
Natural selection
Stop interrupting the natural selection
As a dude who is genuinely trying help other people, sometimes i swear a thought runs through their brain that i might not know what im talking about and they ask a woman and get told the same thing i had just said and a look of clarity washes over their face. Its kinda upsetting and makes me not want to help even if i am the most qualified to help
Natural selection
Where’s OzzyMan to guide him to Destination F….
What's really infuriating is that the Australian is trying to help the guy out and he keeps talking over him like he just doesn't want to hear that a crocodile is likely going to eat him. Make it make sense.
This is how you say, "I don't have enough for retirement but my life insurance is through the roof"
All the crocs under the water like "duuuude..?"
Darwinism... at its finest...
I live in England which geographically speaking is the safest place in the world (no dangerous wildlife, no natural disasters) and it honestly BAFFLES me how people in places like Australia just DO NOT give af, mate 😅
The croc- “I ordered DoorDash like an hour ago. What’s taking so long…”
Some people you just cant get through to.
bros definitely got the darwin award
Ok go ahead 😂😂😂 must be a liberal on that board
Always..., and I mean Always listen to the locals 😮😮😮
Daaaahhhhhwinism.
I would’ve warned ONE time and then immediately pull my camera out and wait for the show 😭😭😂😂😂😂
I NEED a follow up on this story cause I gotta know if he gets got by a salty or not
I wouldn't even take a bath in Australia.  Showers only.
Careful, this person will try to sue you for saving their life
Natural selection at work nothing to see here folks.
Matesa
Up North of Aus - Crocs don't play lol  He will find out soon enough
Something tells me that paddler needs to be removed from the gene pool.  Blokes, grab some popcorn and wait for it all to unfold.
"dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it!" Seriously people always blame the wild animal for attacking humans. You are in their home bro they eat other animals what did you expect
This is exactly what it’s like trying to tell people the truth nowadays, they wanna argue with you and they don’t wanna hear any part of it! 🤡 🌎
Sense isn’t so common
Idiot in the blue
I wouldn't have blurred the guy's face. Let his friends & family see him. Maybe their embarrassment can influence him.
Bro yeah let him do his thing and just keep recording bro you'll be rich 😂
Queensland is full of crocks. Whether in sea or fresh water you still gonna see them.
The kids and I swim there all the time.
Darwinism
Anybody know if their is a video of the aftermath or the full video?
should have just let him paddle, Natural selection
Everytime I think that human stupidity reached the peak, someone prove me wrong.
It’s called natural selection. Let it do its thing.
He probably flew across the world to do this while blaming carbon emissions for climate change.
How did this end ?
Darwin is in Australia so Darwin awards
So let him be its population control! Why does everyone think they need to be everyone’s parent?!
Is there a sequel?
Croc says leave it out
😆😅😅😂 have some common sense 🫠
Bro are you really arguing?! 😅
Pretty sure the Crickey mate knows a thing or 2 about Crocs mate
Please everyone, if I make this mistake .. Speak up. Loudly. TY
Why does he look like tinky winky
The portable signs get put out when there has been a very recent sighting of a crocodile. The fixed signs are there to let you know they are there but have not been spotted recently, they are territorial so they won’t be far.
But don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it! LOL😅
Some biorobots are programmed for autodestruction
Southerners their rally smart.
The dude was wearing crocs also, maybe it was personal
Death Wish.
We get it locally. Grockles come down to the South West from their cities and think it'll be fine taking walks along the cliffs in inclement weather because the world is a safe place, only to find out it ain't.
He even saw the signs warning of crocs in the waters and was still arguing 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
The sea turns green over there ?
Dude thinks the guy with the camera is being a Karen for literally trying to save his life
Crocodile: "Did I go out to the farm & warn the chickens? Ok, then. Leave my dinner alone"
That warning sign was the other way around. Crocs beware aussies about 😂😂
He shouldve let Darwin do its thing
Same as those idiots who wouldn't wear a mask.
I wish there was a follow up video.
Darwin wants his award!  Leave the croc food alone.
The animals are not to blame. The stupidity of ignorant humans is.
What's Tinky Winky doing on a paddleboard. Croc or a sharks had his red gay handbag...
You’re telling a guy dressed up as “The Tic” superhero to have common sense?   He is literally cosplaying as the dumbest man on the planet. Common sense to him would be seen as genius.
Teletubby gonna learn about crocodiles real quick.
If Steve Irwin is scared. You should be scared.
Potential Darwin Award winner.
Jesus mate just  trying to warn you.
It’s like talking to an American liberal 😂
Go do what you wanna do😂
guy is wearing crocs I would believe him
At least he's wearing protection against the harsh sun. 🦟 🦈 🐊
Crocodiles feed on the idiots dont go near the rivers or the water if there are crocodiles.
He’s got a death wish paddling like that on that boogie board 💀
Let him win the Darwin award!
let natural selection do its thing please
I’d be nervous swimming in a backyard pool in Florida.. I couldn’t imagine the level of cluelessness needed to swim in KNOWN saltie infested water.
Leave him, at last even crocs need to eat something...
If an Australian is warning me against a dangerous animal I’m gonna listen.
Stupidity is a Learned Behavior 😂😂😂 Crocs Love it....
Crocs love being disrespected. Go right on ahead mate. Go ahead and swim out into the ocean!
Crocs gotta eat too
Guy showing real concern and this knucklehead is gonna argue, don't blame the crocodile when he eats you
Guy had a great day with no problems except getting harassed by this guy
Is that guy Australian or an Englishman?
“Where’s the sign?”  Which one?
Yup you got dipshits there too.
i hope he didnt make it to the shore
"you're in North Queensland mate have some common sense" 😂
So what happened to him?
Nope
The dinner is ready 🐊
So did he get out or what?
Unreal 😮😮😮😮😮
Idiot
LOL, is he blind if there was that many signs of crocodile warning.
Croc asking who ordered a just-eat.
Cut my ears off and stab my eyes out cause I've seen it all😮
Cameraman has no common sense either if he'd just shut it and filmed him id have some crazy footage right now😂
Thinning the herd, natures plan
His ridicule blue suit will protect him
Hei im Down under i do what i want  Mamma
Just let Darwinism do its thing lol.
That's so us. Go ahead mate. Do what ya wanna do,  just don't blame the croc when it eats ya
natural selection
$u!$!d3 mission
You're just asking a one way ticket to see Jesus quickly 😅
Darwin Award contestant…there’s not helping them
Don’t blame the croc 🐊 who would he complain to
Perfect analogy for a Democrat voter
Ftg
Lol there’s no need for a SIGN to warn people there’s crocodiles… how do you think our ancestors survive? By reading signs? 😂
Ok who has the second vid?
That is just nuts
Can't fix stoopid
Don't help him, we have too many idiots wasting oxygen on this planet. Thin out the herd a little bit.
The ocean around Australia is nature's metal band.  Crocs, sharks, box jellyfish, blue ringed octo, man-o-war, and of course stingrays.  If Steve Irwin couldn't make it, why would you tease a croc like a jalapeno popper?
Nice
Crrrocc jawst waunts saum bloke on tha bawbie
If an Aussie tells you to stop doing something in the water then I'd listen 😅
Don't warn them let nature take it's course we have to many idiots in this world a crocodiles have to eat too.
Those saltwater Crocs are the scariest animal on Earth and you think Great White sharks are bad.
Preview to Natural selection
The croc needs to watch out for his back
This is why I mind my business… some people don’t care about their own life so why should I?! 🥴🤷🏽‍♀️
You’re on Skull Island mate have some common sense! There’s a dinosaur seen recently sign over there!
I always thought how hard it would be to live at those beautiful beaches and not being able to go into the water…
as an australian, “this is north queensland” is enough
Total idiot
😂💥
When you're at a unfamiliar place, always listen to locals.
Crockies love Cockies.
Trust the locals they aren't trying to be Karen's they are giving you life advice lol
How is everybody ignoring the fact that someone in a blue suit is sitting on a foam board on the water?
"it's broken a couple of teeth off the timing gear"
And the Darwin award goes to.....
Australians are smart people. Just saying. Lol
Just tell him to have a good time. Natural selection.
He doesn't have common sense so let him swim we don't need him to procreate 😂
Did knee board boy have a Make America Great Again hat on? He sounds like one.
You wonder why people die. Playing with death
I would love to know how this turned out.
Darwin's theory at work here.....
I love the Queensland accent !  And the people ❤️. Coolest place I’ve ever lived
At this point, I’m no longer entertaining dumb (fill in the blank). I’m not wasting time, you know so much. Ok.
Since the dawn of man they have existed, and before man there were crocodiles.
croc would know he's bad  tukka anyway
They all aussies
Darwin award
Oh this when people are swimming in the brisbane river. Seen it on multiple occasions. 100s of people on the shore, screaming at you to get out of the water because it's infested with bull sharks.
Just let natural selection take its course.
Don’t blame the crocodile lol. Some people have to learn the hard way. Unfortunately this looks like an ultimate lesson
If Crocs can see color he's a goner 😔
“Let me do my thi…..num num num” 💀
I absolutely trust Aussies that say, "Yeah Mate, I wouldn't do that if I were you." They know
Paddle board would look like a jetski if you told me there was a croc near by
The smurf sounds like an Aussie too. Probably city dweller. Certainly an arrogant idiot.
Let the man swim! - the croc
Just let him go man. That guy doesn’t need to be clouding up the gene pool.
I wouldn't tell him anything
If an ozzie WARNS me not to do something,im LISTENING 😂😂
I've always found minding my own business is best. Feining interest in his safety for online content.
Tourist are so dumb… The first thing you should always do is ask someone who lives there if this area is safe. He has it done for him and he’s arguing. Just let him go, buddy… Later, bud.
Well.... he's gonna FAFO real quick.
🤦🏽‍♂️
Dangle your legs in the water, "mate." Get that little extra edge.
I wouldn't even trust a BATH in North Queensland.
If he wants to win the Darwin award just let him. Sometimes nature has to remove the idiots from the gene pool in order for the species to evolve.
Let the crocs deal with him.
Love it when people argue with the guy saving you from getting Murked by a croc… rather get eaten just to prove a point. Reminds me of a quote: when egos collide, the loser wins 😂
🤨😑😑😑😑😑😑
Beautiful concrete.
Must be idiot
His spandex suit is protecting his hands
Ozzzy after the fame
Can’t believe the idiot that was paddling actually argued with the guy !!! Should be thanking him Darwinism at its finest
Is it Kate Smurfwaite?
Keep splashing around idiot 😂
No words. Pure stupidity
This is crazy. There's an area near where I live with lots of alligators. Guess what? No swimmers. I'm sure people have died. I don't know how many, but I know nobody is going to look for a body there. Because it's dangerous. Because of the alligators.
If the Aussie is shouting at you to get tf out of the water You get tf out of the water!!!!
There are people who doesn’t have common sense
The guy warning him of crocs is wearing crocs 🤣🤣🤣
Typical non-common sense YT person.
He's probably a Trumper! Going against everything that's good for him! Can't call him ignorant,he knows better . He is still doing it. That's stupidity.
And yet, the crocs gets the blame
*croc under the boat ramp* "oi shut up let him do his thing"
He is already in the middle of the pond. If he gets attacked, then all you will say is, told you so. So just let him be.  If its his time ita his time. If not let him enjoy the water.
He's from NSW . Can tell by the wet suit.
I see two crocs on his feet right there!
Leave it to mother nature she'll handle business
People will be stubborn even if it kills them.
Can we get an update on what happened to the guy on the paddle board? 😅
survival of the fittest being interupted
I’d be asking that nice guy for a hand to get onto the dock immediately.  And then thank him for his warning.
😂
😂😂😂
The woman didn’t need to speak.
Nooo just let him get eaten ffs, the crocs are hungry bro.
Plz let nature take its course. We’ve gotten to a point where too many idiots are living far past when they should and that person is literal proof.
He dress like a blue fish splashing 😂
Did the croc get him tho ?
What a gronk
Who will go swimming in Australia no
I saw a guy in chest deep water... at 6am... in Karumba... taking selfies of himself... 😶
Lol
When the  croc hunter is telling you be careful, I’d turn into Jesus micheal Jackson Christ you’d see me moonwalking on water
Must be from Melbourne. 😅
Bro that guy was probably never seen again if he didn't heed their warnings
To Be Fair:  Crocodiles do not really like the taste of Geriatric Smurfs.
"The attack came out of nowhere!".......lol
S11) Divorce the wife.
The div on the board has an Australian accent too by the sounds of it, they must receive anti-croc vaccines during the childhood immunisations…
Does this count as suicide?
Never debate with a man with an Australian accent.
Doesn’t splashing the water, scare  the crocodiles?
Let natural selection take its course
His wife is Karen
"Let him be; I think he's onto something." ~Florida Man
Let him go mate....and like you said not the crocs fault.
Literally everyone saying “listen to the ozzy 😪😪” bro listen to the other bloke he’s ozzy too. He’s just reckless.
Im not afraid of Crocs. I am afraid of stingrays. RIP Steve Irwin
infested waters? .. eh, mate that's its home? 🤣🤣
Patiently waiting for update... Man attacked by croc in Australia whilst arguing with the locals attempting to warn him😂😂😂
No medicine for ignorance
Im a professional crocodile and I do not appreciate you telling him  he can't swim there
Not from Australia, but I'd rather swim in a Walmart sewer system with goggles than go into salt croc infested waters. This guy has no sense of survivability. Great job for this Aussie man for warning him.   Much Love to Australia from Texas.
I like that he says don't blame the croc when it gets you. Respect for nature at its finest.
I live in Queensland and the danger of living here is hugely exaggerated,  hold on I'll get back to you something just crawled under the coffee table,
INSANITY
I mean ...just look at the guy ....would it be that bad if the croc got him ?
Trying to save his life and giving pushback. Very Darwinian 🤦‍♂️
Why blur out his face? This video is all over the internet.... personally would of let nature make its natural selection
CROCKS ARE ALL.. MATE—SHHHHhhhh!!! Let HIM BE MATE!! 😂😂😂😂
Not only on a paddle board but splashing about just basically calling out to the crocs
Natural selection
The island whites are almost impossible to understand.
I do so wish they had posted the second installment of this ,  what happens in say, ... five minutes
I'll hear about this from Bob Katter
We got silver surfers chasing croc before GTA!!!
No common sense idiot.
That's the first thing they tell you when you move to Cairns, be very aware of crocs.
Let natural selection play out for god sake
The f—k is that guy wearing?!
The croc is probably going “hey I don’t go to the grocery store and steal your food, so mind ya business”
Advice is one thing but belittling someone in the guise of helping them shows how ignorant you are
Natural selection
Isn't this the same guy who was commenting on that Llama being walked?
You cannot save idiots from themselves.
Idiot !! 🥴
More croc attacks than shark
Boooooooo, I came here expecting a croc fight. I got jipped
Darwin, take him away😂
Oh wow 😮😮😮
Want ta come on board mate?...nahhh got me hands dingy and blue vest I hear crocs don't like blue and small dingys ....right mate?
Shhhh!!!! this is how we thin the herd
Jaimie pull up that video
If only everyone that has the 'I'm right' attitude was this practical in putting it to the test
The guy yelling was being unnecessarily combative. I was getting Karen vibes. Just talk calmly to him.
What an idiot
A reminder that Australians have voted for oppression, disarmament, and Muslim takeover of their country every chance they have gotten.
Neville ******* bartos
How did he make it this far in life ?
What a “croc” of shat!
The cameraman is just as guilty for not letting this man receive his Darwin award. Keep the gene pool clean.
browntown? iykyk
🐊: Nothing to see here, keep moving cameraman 😂
White American mentality everywhere they go " I can do whatever I want, I'm MERICAN!"
let nature take care of him
No common sense at all😂😂😂
He is committing suicide.
Okay, what exactly does that guy want to do on that board, anyhow? It's like the lazy river out there.
😮😮I don't blame ya,You tried ya best, mate😂😂
The irony of him sitting on his board in his sunsafe anti-stinger full body suit isn't lost on me! Mate, don't worry about the stingers and the melanoma's getting you, you aren't going to live long enough!
Australians are basically Florida men.
I sense that Aussies are never wrong because they only argue when they know they’re right
Arguing with a person trying to SAVE you is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen
croc be like: yow shut the fk up its my free meal stop trying to help him
They Love the boat ramp for the people too
Where Chris Hemsworth at I'm sure if he told him not to go in croc infested waters he's prob listen 😅😅😂😂
I’m in Florida and we have the same problem with tourists happily throwing themselves in alligator infested waterways. We try to warn them, as you do.. but some people just won’t listen. Stupidity claims so many lives.
Salties don't GAF, they re extremely aggressive and territorial, this blokes just lucky it wasn't near him at the time.
Even Oz natives have lost their lives to the dangers there, come on now… you have to argue?
One look and you what you are dealing with!
"Where's the sign?" Yeah as if crocodiles read signs
One less member of the Blue Man group
"When in Rome."  Those are words to live by.  If the locals aren't doing it, then it is probably a bad idea.  If they try to stop from doing it, then it is a really, really bad idea.
Any follow up on this? Did he die? Or was his lazy river thrill ride successful?
What a dipstick. He should be named, shamed and have his photo as the new face of "Mad" magazine.
As a cyclist, i get a lot of flack from motorist. Sometimes, though, when someone stops their car to talk to me to be helpful, my first reaction is to be aggressive with them (because i get a flack from motorists).   I wouldn't have gone into that water.  In this video, i think when the guy on land started with, "Use your head, man." was taken as a direct insult by the rafter and caused his aggression. If you're helping someone be  gentle with the words.  Imagine you fall down and someone comes to help you up and they're insulting you for falling and saying "use yor head, man"  and says he should slap you in the back of the head for almost hurting yourself. lol
Tell dumb once, then let nature take its course
Jesus Christ there could be swimming huntsman spiders,duck billed platypus in there there could even be venomous snake's out for a swim knowing Australia
If an Aussie says it's dangerous, it must be dangerous!
Crocs don't eat smurfs 😂 , well , not today !!!
Us Aussies tell you to get out you listen we l grew up with this it’s our life style you listen too us and get out. When we are scared you should be terrified
Living in cairns.... yep happens all the time. I yelled at a  couple of duds myself just recently. But also the locals are sitting on the edge of a creek mouth, toes in the water fishing.
Let natural selection do its part
Salt water crocodiles too just get out of the water.
Ever hear the term: Let nature take its course? Its natural selection! Stop messing with it.
That spandex suit is so mental I think bro needs help surely that's a cry for help right what else could possibly be going on here.
Croc: Right-o. Disclaimer been said. Now it’s fair game.
This feels like some kind of lost Maxmofoe video where Filthy Frank has a new character called Blue Guy and he's on a journey to find Frank in crocodile infested waters 😂
What happened after? Did they eat him?
Dumb f’er. I’ve been shark bit and have the scars to tell the tale for me. I was lucky and it ticks me when I see people take safety for granted.
The Salties were saying the same thing!😮🐊
I think his pronouns are Crocodile/Food
"Don't tell me what to do" is a preteen response . Then, complaining about the sign to  play the victim. Too much..
Unless you're in America. We have GWS off Cape Cod , Massachusetts that make you're white sharks look like dolphins. But  it seems everything other living thing is potentially deadly or poisonous (to humans) in Australia
Dressed up like a seal too bud
Guy seems totally unaware the chances of his survival in the next 10 minutes are *extremely* tenuous
Natural Selection at work.
Even my young kids have heard about Australia's waters, and have no interest of ever going swimming in them.
If crocodile dundee warns me to get out the water I'm out.
As a native Texan, this dialogue is crazy wild
It’s like arguing with someone from Wano about swordsmanship
😂😂😂
Temporary citizen
Crocodiles have to eat to survive a nice blue Smurf will make a nice snack and Darwin will have someone to make a posthumous award to
Natural selection. Let him be.
Did this guy end up getting eaten?  lol
There could be signs saying “Warning: Reaper Leviathans live in this area” and people would still be compelled to pop into that section of ocean.
😂😂😂😂
Sir, Please do not interfere with the wildlife, let nature take its course.
The fact that the guy is arguing with him rather than thanking him for the warning, I wish he'd win the Darwin Award because the world really does need fewer of them out there.
you're a good man for warning him
He's gone to all that trouble to wear box jellyfish protection head to toe, then he goes flirting with the crocs. Some tourists are always In a hurry to be a statistic.
Crocodile: don't listen to him do what you want
Has 3 mins to live
Let him be Croc food 😂
Darwin Award nominee…as pointed out by Crocodile Dundee!
Wokism at its best.
If an Aussie warns you about danger especially dangerous animals. You are in DANGER.🎯💯🤷‍♂️👍❤️
Natural selection.
The croc on the bottom is trying not to laugh
You warned him walk away
L'histoire ne dit pas si elle s'est fait manger par le crocodiles 😂❤
All I can think about is “Bluey” now 🤣
This is the third 🥉 Darwin Award 🏆 recipient video I seen today. Is the Darwin Award coming up already??😂😂
Typical liberal oblivious to danger
😂😂😂😂
Survival of the fittest
Never underestimate stupidity
She said "they love the boat ramp" 😂😂 let's just stay away from water on this trip 😂
"No. I want to keep playing in this green crocodile infested swamp water that you can't see more then 1 cm in.  I prefer it over waters near Melbourne or Sydney where the water is clear and they don't have crocodiles."
I have anxiety just watching this idiot
Crocs must be full.
Dead man in the water
Americans wouldn’t warn ya, they would just have their cameras out n ready to film the inevitable 😂😂
noooooo let these darwin contestants feed the crocs - they have to eat too.
As a crocodile, don't discourage my food.
Common sense??! Never heard of that animal before where can I find a common sense!!???
No longer is there just one idiot per village.
I will never not listen to an Australian in Australia 😮‍💨 what is wrong with people?
Leave him he want to be food
These people are soft, come to Florida, people go out of their way to find waters with crocodiles and alligators
As an American, every time I see videos like this I feel like a Brit bashing Americans for our dumb decisions. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Just keep filming!!!!😂
Oohhh never smile at a crocodile Never tip your hat and stop and chat a while!
It would be nice to see more than the ground!
There goes the next Steve Irwin.
Here's  your sign sir
At least he had the decency to blurr out the fave of a dead man
Let nature run its course😢😂😂😂
I'd be out that water so fvckin fast after an Australian told me to get out, you know you are 5 minutes away from being a snack
Same encounter I had with a snow bird down here in South Florida.  I warned her about walking her dog near the pond and she immediately dismissed my warning. RIP little doggie.
Croc: hey mind ya own business bloke😂
Is the guy on the short wearing Crocs?
obviously the surfer is a Floridian tourist in his element.
“But did I die?”
Lord help us... He missed three signs!!!! At each ramp!!! Lolololololol!!!! Talk about asking for it.
“There’s crocodiles in there moit.”  “whatayatalkinabeet”
Darwin award
What sort of uncomfortable ridiculous thing is he doing anyway?
The lack of basic common sense and respect for your life is breathtaking.
Have some fackin common sinse
I didn’t need the red circle dude, I could see it just fine
Hey bro you warned him.  Nothing else u can do for him. 😂
And the Darwin Award goes to ...
Let him find out.
Thats insane
He must be a democrat from America
Bloke makes a great point.  But his points being made whilst standing right on the edge of the boat ramp himself.
This man is single-handedly stopping gay marriage in North Queensland
Croc - "Shhhhh guys, I'm hungry".
The irony is the guy that's trying to warn him is wearing crocs lol
At least 2 crocs seen recently
Saying this in Crocs is hilarious tho 😂
Tourists feeding the Crocs again.
Just let it go, mate!
Mind u own biz
Cairns is crazy. Beautiful beaches that are completely empty.
Not only crocodiles, but the saltwater crocodile, but the largest extant reptile in the world, the salt water crocodile 😂 couldn’t pay me any amount of money to do what this blue idiot is doing
going to australia is insane going into austrailian waters thats just suicidal
Saltwater Crocodiles are HUGE and ferocious.
Natura have a awesome way to restrict,inferior expeximents come to reproduce.
Local crocs "leave the man alone, Karen!".
He presumably thinks he can out paddle a 20 foot salty in that wetsuit.
Natural selection at work
There are idiots everywhere. They come here to the Great Smoky Mts and get out of their cars to approach a momma black bear and her cubs ....😤
natural selection
He obviously didn't know what he was getting himself into.  I hope he got back safely.
Theres nothing common about having sense
Darwinism with take over. Nature will take care of the dumb people.
Natural Selection hard at work...
If an Australian is yelling at me that I'm crazy for being in the water I'm getting out immediately
They walk among us…IDIOTS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.
How idiots die
That's called natural selection...
Natural selection at it's finest.
Natural selection, free croc food!
Absolute twit. Crocs rule up north .
i dont think this guy understands...i think he wants to pet the crocs...He's like Oh they love hanging by the boat ramps? i'm in the right spot then..
Ye ur right, I didn't believe it. BS again
Hey mate that's unAustralian, you supposed to tell him after he gets attackd by the crocodile.
"Leave me to do my thing"  No, we don't just watch people commit suey.
crocs: " that brain is not worthy"
I told a traveller not to swim in the water near Darwin. He ridiculed me. So I said " ask the police officer and by the way if you get taken it won make news because you are not famous enough".
The real problem isn't that guy jeopardizing his own life, it's jeopardizing other people's lives. Someone will either have to wrestle him away from a salty if he's attacked, or him getting eaten will create yet another man-eater that someone else will then be attacked by. Next thing you know a kid is getting dragged into the surf and the croc itself (and possibly any of similar size in the area) will have to be exterminated.   People having no concern for their own life is a different matter when it turns into other people's problem too.
What annoys me most about people like this is when they do get attacked its always the crocs fault and never their own.
If u r in the water in Australia u in danger....even in the swimming pool 😂
In the USA we call these blokes Alabama people.
"the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live; and after that they go to the dead" (Ecclesiastes 9:3). Looks like this guy is in a rush to go to the dead.
There are crocodile traps on the beaches there with signs warning people to watch their step for the traps and the crocs.
You wouldn't have to tell me that because I wouldn't dare go in that water without a boat.
Common sense? How about lack of? 😮
That numbnut on the board is probably a red hat wearing American. He's entitled
What's meant to be is meant to be! Where can get a wet suit like that!!
I hope he left 😮😢
Don't blame the Crocodile when you get done by it 😂
Yeah there's no.. thanks for saving my life.
He thinks hes ace ventura or steve irwin but a damm pale imitation of a legend of the game and just a top bloke all round then you got this fool wqnting to get stung or bitten go tell steve irwins family its a ok thing 2 do in the area hes in its like playing with a loaded gun thumbing the trigger and looking down the barel
They hang around waiting 4 fish and that 1 silly sod that ignores every sign both written and in his own brain he ignores every natural instict 2 survive so he can go and prove the guy right and then act totally shocked yet hes in the literal most dangerous country say 4 the amazon or subsaharan australias wildlife are just all deadly even there birds can rip ur belly apart or throat the koala gives u chlamydia and hes nice thats the nice 1 shark croc spider snake scorpion ur dead bro doggos and then my man thinking hes ace ventura
What Australian doesn’t know about the Crocs
Let the fool get eaten or bit hes only in australia it aint like there known 4 having any dangerous creatures bugs etc im pretty sure australia has every kind of nasty thing say 4 lion tiger or bear everything else and be it spider snake octopus shark there going 2 be either the deadliest or very damm as near to spiders the size of actual dinner plates tarantulas funnel web 1 as big as a tarantula salty crocs fresh water crocs caymen only other species larger is the nile croc there the largest but australia has plenty of 15ft pluss beasts or the sharks or the jelly fish or fish this guys making a flounder sized silloute below the water any fish staring up is seeing a fish shaped shadow with arms either side flapping if he isnt saying im in distress eat me his silloute is saying im a grouper sorry not a flounder a big grouper
😂
Yikes paddle boarder, just say “Thanks” and get out of the water fast!😱 🐊
It's called natural selection for a reason, dumb people get killed so the genetic gene pull gets stronger.
Idiots
Im Australian and wouldnt even travel up north where crocodiles and things are
And so, what was the outcome? Sushi or not sushi?
Guy in the water is dumb he aint got long left on this earth
No way I would get anywhere close to that water. It’s way too murky.
I dont need an Australian to tell me that is a stup!d idea...
When Australians tell you, you're doing something crazy you had better listen
Some people just cannot be helped.
In North Queensland, water = death.
We have the same problem in Florida. Always some tourist who thinks retention ponds are for swimming. Usually it's just their pets that get eaten. We call them gator snax.
Cameraman had one job 🤦‍♂️.
'You're in North Queensland Mate, have some f*cking sense." 😂 That's the most Aussie thing I've ever heard! Also, how dumb can people get?
Foolish
dude if that was me an dude told me there's crocks all over the joint  I be back on land real quick 😂
She was 27...
God loves an idiot
I would absolutely listen to his advice
Some people are so dumb.
The gene pool takes care of itself.
There is a places where I will never put my foot and I see Chinese family walking through the water.. It's weird to see a huge yellow sign with crocodile 🐊..it supposed to be warning sign....
And if is only Crocks....
That could be a Trump voter.
Sounds like my girlfriend taking a well meant suggestion
Just let him eating by crocodile....n u just filming....
Leave ppl alone
He thought he knew better and the Australian is telling him NO YOU DON'T.
Saltwater Crocs are the largest living reptile, most aggressive, and tend to treat humans as prey.  American Crocs are a different type of crocodile, less aggressive, and tend to stay away from humans. Yes, Florida does have crocodiles, but they are not like the Salty's or Nile crocs.
And I thought us Texans were hard-headed.
To the guy filming: mind your own business... Who cares if he gets eaten it's not your problem
Yeah righto 😂
I’m in the U.K. and I’m even looking for crocs right now after this warning
It's ok, let nature take it's course 😈
Should have called him Chum because that is what he will end up as.
C'mon, man - well intentioned, but don't stop Darwin from doing his practical work ...
Cairns. Dangerous.
Yeah right'o famous last words
As a part time crockodille I am against this message
Are people missing the fact it's a DUMB AUSSIE (AKA yuppy). You can tell by the exasperated confidence in his stupidity 😂😂😂😊
He's just here for the Darwin Awards Ceremony!
Darwinism 😂
O, just leave him alone....he's on his way to Darwin.
Croc: why is food coming towards me?
Natural selection
Let natural selection do it's work
Why is the guy in the water so worried about needing a sign? It’s NQ so there are crocs in the water sign or not.
What an absolute drongo.
"Wheres the sign" The fact that there was 3 right there had me cracking up.
During an encounter with human, great white will MISTAKENLY bite 1 out of 500 times . Saltwater Croc PURPOSELY 1 out of 2 ?
Where's the sign?   Immediately points at 3.
That's why I love south Australia
Bro should have checked his compass 🧭!!!
This dude in the water is totally clueless. This is not a Karen telling someone not to fish in the water, this is a mate looking out for another mate!! You  did your part, friend.
Natural selection at work 😂 Wait …..
Is he cosplaying sonic the hedgehog?
You cant save everyone.... Maybe he has a death wish...
Some has to much undeserved pride, and are willing to die to point a point, of no, I can’t be wrong.
He's in far north Queensland, not even in the water and he's wearing a full body wetsuit. Please, just let nature sort this out
Oh my gawd. That should be deemed illegal and he's better off behind bars.
This story has another marine etiquette lesson.. when the guy on the tiny paddle board craft is in distress, it's not optional to render help when someone at sea is in a life safety situation.. you can't refuse to help people despite them using no sense... often you have to rescue someone despite themselves..
Only reasonable excuse for this is if and only if that guys is from Florida.
The sort of person who travels to incredibly dangerous places to demonstrate the 'goodness of humanity', gets kidnapped and costs the authorities a fortune negotiating their release.
I only john boat on my Florida river, can't swim with gators
1st time: Advise, 2nd time: Enjoy the croc show in 4K.
Im sure he is from China
I'd keep filming for the animal planet moment😂😂😂
I legitimately think this man is suicidal. Like, no way he’s lived this king being that dumb. Especially in Australia.
If Australians ain't fuckn wit it, you probably shouldn't either...
This guy is altruistic mate. He is voluntarily eliminating his weak genes from the gene pool! 😂😂😂
I was in QLD a couple of years agon and there was a sign on the beach about jelly fish - I didn't go for a swim unfortunately but stayed safe...
Never seen someone want to get eaten by a croc so bad it’s interesting 🤧🫠😭
Liberal
Don’t blame the 🐊 crocodile when you get done by it 😂
A fool and his life are soon parted.
AWESOME Lad....tell him how it is...full on IDIOT....
Great camera work😢
Lol just let Darwin win.  Some people are just not meant to die of old age.
Where's the sign? Wow needs a sign to believe FNQ has crocs  in the water. Keep paddling mate.
A clear look at the insanity in this world 😂
Did he survive
Is this guy for real, when and where about this happen, far north Queensland where ? I'm Aussie just wondering when this happen.
Mate you are going to win the Darwin award 😂
Let natural selection do its thing.
if the Australian wouldn't do it, why would you  ...anything involving animals
Bet that dude took 15 covid shots tho
Yeah nah if an Aussie tells me what to do, I listen to
Crocs will take that guy out of the gene pool.
No croc in its right mind would attempt to attack an Aussie. I bet he even had a camera on him for safety.
Where's the sign? Crocodiles can't read....
"don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"  <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Now, what was the purpose of this subpar recording?
Why would he when people are warning him be interesting to know if he arrived home at the end of the day
I say let him "find out."
“Where’s the sign alligator sign”   😂😂😂😂
Nature Has A Great & Efficient Way Of Weeding Out The Slow & The Dumb...
I'm listening to anyone with an Australian accent and this is coming from someone born in Texas and who lived all over Florida. They're like us on steroids so I'm worried about whatever freaks them out. 😂
You sure that's a person and not a crock in a blue body swim suit?
Let Darwinism win.
Best cameraman ever
Saved that idiots life
Well how much longer did he last?
Where’s the f … sign??? Hello … you w…r
Must be a MAGA cult member on that board…
Typical Brits. Effing idiotic.
Crocodile :  " Our ancestors built this country to avoid the dictatorship of Europeans monarchs. Dont bring here the issues your ancestors let behind.   Australia is a Land of freedom and opportunities.  "
Crocodile :  " Peoples are jealous because you dont pick their way, mate. You r a REAL anti-conformist.  And that s why government hates you.  And they work for the government you know ?..... "
Sometimes, evolution needs to be given the freedom to act for the betterment of our species...
The warning signs say to not swim there because of crocs. But it does say that making a ruckus because  your hands are splashing in the water is fine.... if you don't like that particular set of hands.
Idiot
Crocodiles have taken men off boats.
I would never go near waters in Queensland not to mention NORTH QUEENSLAND
What happened to him? Does anyone know??
Let him carry on its natures natural selection process in full swing.
He thinks a Darwin Award is a good thing!
What a farkwit
I identify as not moreish to crocs. I will not be oppressed!
Natural selection incoming
Can’t fight natural selection, can you? 😢
What is he wearing ?
I'd just say have a good day because the Croc is going to have one 😂😂
Sometimes, you need to let a stubborn person bump their head to understand.
"Maybe I'm in the minority, but this Aussie bloke is out of line. He needs to back off, mind his business, and go about his day." - the Crocodile
He was never seen again. XD
He must be from Darwin 😅
Or the bullsharks or sawfish. But you do you😂
Why would you record this
Darwinism
Will you swim with alligators an crocodiles all the time in Florida if you leave them alone they will leave you alone
Natural selection
who goes in the water in australia?
Where's part 2 of this scenario?
They say drowning is a peaceful way to go but its probably not so peaceful when the croc thats drowning you is in a death roll
Which is why I don’t go for a nice casual walk with my kids in southwestern Alaska when you know that’s the highest population of Kodiak bears
Darwin Award goes to-
I wish south asians were like this bloke
If I went to Australia…. I’m not going into the bush or near water lol
That woman must be Insane and looking for real trouble. I think she is on a suicide mission.
Darwin award..
Listen to the locals mate!
aussies have to be cautious of all 3 types of taipans. when an aussie says theres dangerous wild life about, it's probably best to listen. bodies of water in the southern hemisphere in general arent very friendly to humans
Why are there crocodiles in the ocean?
If Aussies are scared, we are also scared. NO question asked.
In very few places, if any,  is the expression “You enter the ocean, you enter the food chain.” more relevant than in northern Australia…
Hey, dude has the right... to be an instructional moment. Salties and Bull sharks. Ring the dinner bell.
He is obviously mentally challenged.
Hope the idiot does not give the croc indigestion
Gotta love the distant woman voice slightly yelling and adding details about the crocodiles' hunting habits
Am I the only one who thought he was also on a paddle board
I would have just watched, theres no shortage of idiots
Never mind! Have a nice day! Enjoy while you can!😅
Crok snack😂😂😂😂
'Don't blame the crocodile ' 👌🏼
Another fake video
😂😂😂😂 let im' go
croc bait
Anywhere in the world...when a local says run....run 😂
*Please don't interfere with evolution, the crocks will insure "Kneeboarder Smurf" wont make babies, thus slowing down the progress of Idiocracy.*
"Where's the sign?" >surrounded by signs  Darwin Award just waiting to happen.
Darwin award nominee 😅
He’s looking for attention and a new backside
I would have kept quiet and waited for the show.
This reminds me of people walking past the active volcano signs.
“Common sense” isn’t so common
I wanna see how this ended lol
Why do you tell him
I can tell by the tone of his voice and dialogue that he truly cares for this guy’s safety.
Crocodiles come here, please.
What a fucken Muppet. Dressed like a blue teletubi.
Age does not mean wisdom. I can’t believe this fool has survived this long.
Something tells me he’s going to blame the croc when he gets done by it 😂
Saltys are absolutely the last animal u want to play with. If it sees u. Its coming straight for u This guy ⚠️ him is trying to save him from a horrible death!!
where did he go. 🤔
QQQQUUUEEEEEEEEENNNNSSSLAAAAANNDDDDEEERRRRRR!
To be fair to the guy he's wearing camouflage.
Bro i once went canoing with my dad in Georgia and my dad was trying to jump out every time he saw an alligator
"i'm fully aware." 2 seconds later, "no, no, I'm not aware at all."
Sometimes no one cares bud, he's not the only whitefulla in Australia that ain't  aware of where they come, go and stay.
An ignorant foreigner argues with an Australian about crocs; already know who won this debate
Plz tell me some one got a video of him being munched the fk upppp
Amazing blue man is as old as he is
Natural selection at work....along with no common sense....and shear rudeness to someone trying to save your life. When an ozzy tells you, you are in serious danger then listen you pompous nitwit.
The guys friend bet him $1,000 that he couldn't survive paddling past 3 crocodiles and back again.  He gladly accepted the bet and said, "Easy money I'm wearing my crocodile deterent suit."
Crocs gotta eat
This guy has zero survival instinct, he was made to be a croc biscuit. Let natural selection do its work.
🤣🤣🤣 dude needs a sign to point out crocs in Nth QLD
Is he still paddling?
Florida man meets Aussie man right there. I was waiting for this epic encounter for years!
I mean if he wants to die thats his business karen
Darwin Award in the making
Dr: "Why are you in therapy today?" Dude was like, "i just want to go and die today by croc attack. Amd some bloke came up and messed up my plan."
Nice little lure splashing about seriously insane
Where is the idiot from probably America?
Let him become din dins 😂 some ppl need to learn the hard way 😂😂😂
I wouldn't go near any water in Australia
Lols fastest exit outta the water everrrrr 😂
You dont need a sign to tell you not to swim in Australia,Its just common sense!!
i wouldn't have said anything, just like he said, let him do his thing, its natural selection at work.
😢😢😢
The world today, someone trying to save his life and its all ego and arguments. What happened to thank you for caring. Could of left him to the croc for all theyre helping.
From that day forward, no one could figure out just what happened to Vern.
Survival of the fittest lol
Oh come on let the guy get his Darwin Award. No respect for people being jerks when others just trying to save your life.
All you people in the comments saying about listening to locals, the Smurf a death wish sure sounds like a local 😂 I don’t think he’s ignorant he’s just nuts. Quite frankly he should have stopped recording and called the police, that man was not well.
The situation will sort itself out soon😊
freakin A people
Croc in the background says stop arguing with his snack!
You should know better than to question a member of the blue man group
Never wanted someone to get eaten by a croc so much
when Australian warn you about something,take it as final warning
How can someone be this dumb? Seriously just let Darwin handle itself
You should have told him that thrashing about scares the Crocs away.
Let Darwin be Darwin.
Crocs and Great White's
😮FAFO
Natural selection, let the fool carry on.
Ease up, he's got his Croc Repellent gear on😂🐊
Imbecile croc food
Well when he's in a death roll with the croc then he'll wish he had listen
‘I’m not…. Go ahead and do you “ he changed his mind so quickly loool😂😂😂
Average Australian
Honestly at some point just let natural selection take its course…
Darwinism 😂
THIS! This is what natural selection is for!
Why is the idiot arguing with the local ?
Bro just sit down get popcorn ya camera and enjoy darwinism at its finest 😂😂😂
i still cant believe that there are people this dumb but well as you can see this man deffinitly is
Don’t blame the crocodile 🐊 words of wisdom
Common sense ain't Common
This just in.  Teletubby eaten by croc.
I see a Darwin Award in the making....
A listen There’s people with common sense and there’s people with zombie brains. There’s example a on a surfboard and there’s example B on the deck just let people be alligator being in shark bait and whatever because there’s a lot more of them than mother nature so just let more nature take over and let them be big alligator bait and shark bait and leave it there
The fact that the paddler is also australian is funny.
The fck is he wearing? And what is he riding? And what is he doing? Tourists
😂😂😂😂😂 food
And you wonder why the croc suffers...
The croc 🐊 is like shussss🤫 let the man be
The old guy probably has a mental disorder, he needs help in this situation.
I wonder if he catched a fish :)
Much nicer than I am... once they started arguing i would have agreed with them so they stayed.
Darwin was a genius. Or was he merely just an observer?
Hey! You’re gonna get eaten
All the crocs right then and there 'DUDE SHUT UP AND LET HIM SWIM"
That fool was going out of his way to wina Darwin award.
Just leave him be and keep recording. Use a tripod if possible
Yeah! RightO!
I wonder where the idiot is from,
Dumb lady. The guys trying to protect her.
Why would you argue with someone trying to warn you about crocodiles?
Send him to Florida. Our alligators are way more chill than crocs. Big ol' swamp puppies is all we have here 😂
He's trying to help you idiot.  Have some humility.
Bloke on paddle board, brainless idiot
Common sense aren't all that common!!
I live 2 minutes from this spot. Yes there is lots of crocodiles.
How appropriate.  a Darwin  Award candidate  in Darwin!!!
Heck no. If a local is warning you get out!!!
And you chose to film this??  What does that accomplish for you? Like tangibly. Not by perception. 😂
At least he's got a stinger suit on😂
No see this annoys me because the Aussie is less likely to warn someone else in the future who would appreciate their life being saved!   I have an extreme dislike of bitting or stinging wildlife 😅
This guy is a total buffoon - his getup, his tiny board all in croc infested waters.  A plus buffoonery right there!
Maybe his thing is to be eaten alive by a croc, everyone's got their own fetish. Lack of common sense is a global phenomena.
Crocs get huge in Australia
The Croc is saying . Hey for crying out Mate don’t scare my next meal away . lol 😂
In Australia we will give you one warning, after that it is all on you.😉🇦🇺
Ironically, he's from Darwin.
I lived in Darwin for years, never went in the water
you didnt take into account his camouflage, crocs will never see him they will think he is just a piece of sky
So did a croc get him? Not saying I wanted it to.... but... 🤷‍♀️🐊
Darwin Award
Thats too bad, Darwin was looking for its latest contestant
Leave him alone. Its population control.
You can have all the arrogance and ignorance you like until you're wrestling with a 7 metre salty
That’s just Australian man meeting Florida man.
Arguing with someone from the land of death 100% deserves a Darwin Award
who on earth paddles around in Croc land
Oh come on I'm sure this man can get himself out of a vicious deathroll while submerged under water. Their bite force is only roughly 4,000 pounds.
Some people hey 😅😅😅😅😅
We all know the crocodile will indeed be blamed.
Majority of people grabbed by crocs are tourists that don’t listen to the locals
Sorry for potentially saving your life
Crocodile is about as dangerous as bunny rabbit
Natural selection.
Natural selection lol
How can he not see the crocs!...they're on his feet!
There's warning someone, then there's being a d - head. Not sure which one he's actually being.
Well he cant blame the croc if it eats him🐊unless he comes back to haunt the croc👻☠️   My cousin house is infront of a river and their neighbor got eaten by a croc. They also had a troop of lions infront of their gate and could not get out. You have to be SOOO careful if you have pet's... They have some sad stories😢
Who cares let the old guy paddle nothing better to do then windge at other people sound like pauly
Natural selection at its peak😂😂😂
Being warned about crocs by an Australian wearing crocs should always be taken seriously!
If an aussie fears something, you better listen 😂
Genepool will sort itself out, just leave 'em to it. Hopefully he hasn't bred yet.....
In den letzten 15 Jahren, wurden sehr dumme Menschen herangezüchtet!!?🤔
That board he is on makes no sense. It is way too short
In the US, he would've been a Trump voter
Meanwhile in Australia in an crocodile infested lake: “Just let me die for godsssakes”
It's obvious that this guy is trying to win a Darwin award! 😂
A potential Darwin award winner in Darwin. Truly, pure irony.
The fact that he kept arguing with a local about it is what gets me
Some people are just too dumb to live.
Goes to holiday in Australia, stays in hotel.
Some people just won’t be told and always think they know better
Wait hes actually arguing where is the sign. 😅 holy s just let the crocodile thin the heard this guy is absolutely a problem wherever he goes on land as well.
Darwin award
What an idiot 😂
click bait
As an Aussie that’s lived in croc country, the bloke yelling is a wanna be northerner from no doubt Melbourne, can’t make fire can’t surf, can’t fish and he’s not in the shot coz his mum dropped him on his face to many times to be called accidental, the woman banshee calling is his wife and cousin
Let him win a Darwin award.
He's not Aussie
Is he American? 😊
If an Aussie is worried, you should be terrified.
Please don't tell me he's American.  🫤
Guaranteed he's woke
The only things crazier would be doing this in northern territory
Leave him alone. He's feeding the sharks and the crocodiles😂
“WhEre’S tHe SiGn?”  The AUSSIE telling you not to be in the water is only sign you need.
Im no Doctor, but this is an easy diagnosis of mental retardation.
i think they're both crazy for living in a place where you can just randomly have small dragons in the water
He missed the crocs on his feet... but you gotta love Australians; more autonomous than Americans, and better neighbours.
I haven't lived in Florida in years and yet I still look for dangerous animal signs whenever I'm hear water. Gators may not be Crocs, but they're just as deadly if given the chance.
Come on now, just let nature take its course
I wonder if the crocs think the blue outfit is fancy wrapping. And, do they apply the BBQ sauce to the suit itself, or do they rip the suit off first?
Let him be sit back and enjoy the show 😅
God I love Australians!!!
Bro, i live in Germany and i dont go swimming in the Rhine because of crocodiles!!!
just let natural selection do it's work.
It ain't crocodile infested, the crocodile belongs there
Actually the crocs hang around the boat ramps waiting for morons like this guy
Part 2 of this video got taken down… 😅 🐊
It’s like talking a guy off the bridge who is ready to jump…
I can see why the dinosaurs went extinct now. They consumed too much dumb food like this and it had a detrimental affect on their ability to survive.
Minding your own business seems harder and harder for people!!!
This is God's way of controlling our population....please stop trying to save people from living their dreams of becoming croc 💩....if these people don't do what your warning them not to then we as a whole community have to keep putting up with their ignorant stupidity....thank you.❤❤❤
I DONT understand ppl like this, are they really this pig headed? 🥴 Do they really think their that special and excempt from being chewed by a crocodile  Ppl like this think their "owed" tomorrow, well your not, cos you is NOBODY!  My mentality is I'm not swimming there cos I respect these animals and I know they wouldn't show me mercy, they don't give a fk who you are and what you've done for the world,  They just see "food" or they see "intruder"  They should of let him be dinner, His attitude is trash, Can't stand ppl like this honestly, such a sheltered life that's all about THEM! 🙌 🙄🐊
Natural selection taking place right in front of you 😂😂😂😂 good for you trying to save his life
Classic example of wanting to be right is more than doing what's right.
Haha
Well, Crocodiles and Fish gotta eat....  ME: I'm an American and If an Ozzy tells me there's danger there...... I'm going to be standing next to him in .02 seconds asking why he's yelling at me.....  😳😁!
He wants to feed the crocs!
What the actual……it’s like me having a swim in the Kimberley waters where we lived for 7 years……it’s called clinical challenge.
When Florida man goes Down Under before getting dragged Down Under.😅
Karen the crocodile crier
I suppose that fellow decided he was finished with life. No one with any sense would do something like that
i can hear that guys mullet from here....
Idiots do the the same thing hate  in darwin 🤦
A non Australian hitting an Australian with a passive aggressive “yeah Righto “= big disrespect 😤😂
"Let me do my thing too." - crocodile 🐊
Leave him and watch the show
I don’t think the crocodile cares if there’s a sign or not mate
He probably has pronouns... Hopefully the crocodile will accept them... 💩
Natural selection, let it sort itself out
Here’s your 🪧
Did he really have to reverse hand paddle to slow his speed to heed this warning?
The paddling with the hands not going anywhere 😂
Sometimes we eat food, sometimes we are food. The cycle of life.
Darwin disliked this video
The Blue Man Group is looking for a missing member
Common sense is rare these days 😂😂😂
The blue is some type of camo😂
Croc: dude, shut up, thats my lunch
Some people are that dumb that fear isn't even an emotion 💀
Remember that this guy has a vote 😅
An Aussie will jump into dangerous waters to save you if you are drowning, but taking on a 2 tonne crocodile, yeanaaaaaaa
“Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it” 😂
F around and find out.
Kalau tetap maksa biarin aja jadi makanan buaya 😂😂
They're trying to save his life..😅
Natural selection...
Let evolution take its course...
The ignorance... Natural selection at its finest
🐊 : Oh don't be such a Karrrren...
Croc food.
Anyone else come to the comments expecting to read he got ate? Just me?  Fine
Inbreds 😂😂😂😂
knee boarders are radical.
at least we know he can no longer contribute to the Gene pool
Dude would freak if he saw the gator infested lakes I've kayaked in lol
Crock:Blymee let the bloke do his thing like he's asking,me and the other crocks are watching him so he will be ok
Can you imagine getting eaten in that blue jump suit on that little paddle board 😅😂😂
Dude can’t even afford an adult-sized board…
Its called natural selection. Just let nature do its thing. The smurfs attitude is all wrong
Wow.... Gene Pool
Where’s the sign? Haha how about thanks for trying to help 😂
Just warn the man, if he doesn't listen, move on...
Of course it’s an old white guy
Some people cant be helped.
People think our Florida swamp puppies are bad 😆
Well, that’s one way to delete yourself..
Imbecile
An absolute bell end.  Let him win his Darwin trophy.
What's the difference between a paddle board and that other thing he was on
How’s the suit, hood and everything.
He's got common sense has a stinger suit on 😅.
View farming content thieves
I can hear this man's aussie accent, he's aboriginal. When an aboriginal is worried, you do as they say and count your lucky stars- because crocs don't scare them
Ehhhh.… what's the worst that could happen??
😂
IDIOT 🤡😂🤣😂😅👍
He whas a good guy but stubborn god bless him✝️.
He whas a good guy but stubborn✝️😂
Arrogant
Crock blocking...the crocodiles gotta eat too
If I'm in Australia and an Australian is warning/yelling at me about crocs or any dangerous animal I'm def going to listen!!
Some folks seem to love risking death by testing wild animals. 😂😂😂  No common sense
There are less painful ways to commit suicide
Hey, thats what they told the Obamas chef!!!!!😦
A liberal 😂😂😂😂
The next time I hear about this man, it will be on the Final Affliction channel.
This man wants to win a Darwin award like Susan Lucci wants a daytime emmy.
Survival of the fittest
Darwin award!
Not infested just inhabited by crocs
It is natural selection at its best 😂😅😊
Crocs don't worry me here in Darwin but I won't even set foot in the ocean here. Irukandji are something out of a horror movie.
Guy has to be a maga American..😂 they are all at war with the truth& logic is their kryptonite..😂😅
Plot twist: the paddler was also Australian
🐊 "danm spoiler!"
😂
I saw some episodes of I should not be alive.  They were mostly people ignoring safety advice.  It would be funny but it's just so crazy seeing people who just don't care to bother with safety at all.
Darwin award Finalist.
Pft, natural selection at its finest
Darwinism at work.  Hopefully he has not bred yet.
🐊💬 Croc: Dinner on a Plate tonight!!
Just like the parents that were on Vacation at Disney World in Florida and they let their little two-year-old son play by a lake That's actually on the property of Disney world where the hotels are a huge  Alligator came right up and grabbed him and they didn't find his body for a couple days😢 But in this situation Disney World didn't even have signs up on a Sandy beach  on their property
If an Aussie tells me there is a dangerous animal, I’m listening. Just like he would listen to me about guns and shootings.
Darwin award!!!
and ofc nobody here can tell me what ended up happening…
Can confirm, the one time I've seen a saltwater croc was under a boat ramp.  Only came out at night tho
If an Aussie is scolding me for something dangerous, I’m not gonna think twice I’m just gonna listen to him😂
A concerned Aussie is trying to help you, pay attention to his warnings
Idiot
Grew up north queensland, we get taught this as kids seen heaps of them, one of them about 30 meters off from the skatepark just chilling on the bank of a pond 🤣  Not just the crocs but box & irukangi jellyfish, dont swim in river systems and if surfs flat dont swim
Somebody who's dying to be the next meal. 🙄
Australians are nothing but a bunch of shandy drinking poofters!!! 😂😂😂
Just leave him be natural selection will take over
Hes in Darwin trying his hardest to get his Darwin award so just let him !!!!!
I live in Florida, so I get it. Don't go in the water.
It doesn’t even have to be a big one. Just a hungry 12 footer.
Top contender for the next Darwin award.
He needs a sign??
Watch out for the most dangerous animal more - us. Humans.
Never interrupt a Darwin Award contestant.
I live in a country that is landlocked and doesn't have things that will eat you alive in our waterways. If I was in Australia and any local told me to immediately get out of the water, I would most definitely listen. Same for Florida.
When in Australia... Listen to the locals if theyre giving you are warning 🤦🏼
Common sense was a class that many people skipped while in school
its not like he jumped on the crocs back.  They dont eat people usually.  And the dude said have common sense- your money has the queen of england on it? common sense mate?
Who care’s about this blokes idiocracy!! Let this muppit argue with the crocs!! 😂
Why help him? The crocs will take real good care of him.
Stop bothering the man...he's trying to commit suicide by croc.
Guy is just trying to save his life... and he's arguing with him about it.
Crocodiles in the ocean? 😳
never know what hit him until it's too late
Just hearing “don’t blame the croc” would have me like Jesus… sprinting on water😂💯
this is just Darwinism.
Thought they were gonna show croc shoes in the water
Asking for trouble 😂😂
I for 1 vote to demolish ALL warning signs 😂
Idiot 😂
White people are different 🙄  They make signs in english but can't understand english
😂 seeing is believing sometimes can be fatal.
Always listen to an Aussie warning you, they are British descendants, the BULLDOG breed 💪🏻 and don’t fear nuffin so when an Aussie warns you like this, listen 👂
Wow! What an ignorance? 😮
Entitled folk should be left to do what they want
Charlie Bucket is dressed like a Blue Parrot fish 🐟 in croc waters.  Grandpa Joe taught him zero survival skills.
Aussies need to do as they're told by everyone else. It's like...a law.
Doubting a Australian man is your first  problem. When an Australian says there some sort of animal like a crocodile or some scary shi they not lying it’s another fun day to them😂
Liberals 😂 no comon sense
Where’s the croc??
Natural selection mate
Crocodile got his lunch time meal lol 😂
Just listen man and get out!!
😂😂😂🤣🤣😆👍
Australian liberal
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
People just can't help themselves 🙄
RIP
I don’t see a single croc so therefor this video is faked
As Steve Irwin would say, there's a big crock over there get out chap!
An Australian warning you about Crocodiles while wearing Crocs...take heed mate.
You need a sign???!! Dude yer in Australia! I would check under the bed for a croc before I got in.
Listen to the man paddler! He’s trying to save your life dude!
Crocodile: Leave the poor man alone.....  Please! Paaleess....
"you're in North Queensland mate. Have some common sense."   "I've got this blue wet suit on. How about THAT for common sense."
Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it
Dude just stopped natural selection from taking place 😂
Give that Smurf its Darwin Award! 😂😅😂
why did he stop filming the guy in the water. I didn't see any crocs.
Yeah righto!! Lol pipe down 😅
Boomers. Nobody GAS.
Future Darwin Award champion contender
The Fish and Turtles agree with the paddleboarder
...10 mins later...croc: burp!!!😂
I definitely saw two crocs in this video 😂
“Don’t blame the croc when you done by it mate”
What is dude doing there in that thing? I hope he didn't become croc's lunch.
Can’t believe the attitude from that guy. Wow. Let me do my thing. This isn’t America, bro, and they’re not Karens .They’re actually trying to WARN you. lol fishbait.
I agree with him don't blame the crocodile😊
Crocodiles are in the Mary River. In a hundred years they'll be up the Brisbane River.
Leave him for the crocodile if he wants to be a crazy fool.
and he's wearing Crocs! Listen to him!
Crocs are only 1 of many reasons not to get in the water in Australia!!! Who needs a sign??
Personally I would go nowhere near water or greenery in australia
Now I want to see the after video!
When you get "done by". 😂😂😂  That's that down under slang. lol. I like it.👍
Mind your own business. If he wants to be Kroc food that's his business
He should listen to what he’s being told .
Got more respect for the stingers 😂 Blueboy
Stupidity can be infuriating so he's justified to be infuriated with this dude. What's also upsetting, if not more, is whichever croc that gets him will have his days numbered as he'll be hunted down and killed.
Is it too hard to give good advice while keeping the camera straight?
See it all the time near my place tell them once then let them find out
First rule is..whenever an aussie warns you of something just brush it off. Its not worth your time trust me
Dude, those crocs could easily take him right off that board and he will never be seen again, thats crazy, I mean I sure the odds are not high during the day in open water, but still lol
Darwin award winner in the making
Trying to save his life was such an inconvenience
Common sense isn't common.
Australia is so extreme that they have signs that says, "A F'ing Crocodile Recently Seen"
and this is why YouTube exists.
Bet he’s from Florida
Idiot
Sounds dramatic but possibly Australian Karens
Lol he still alive
UGH!
Was that Joe Biden thinking he's Australian?😊
Genius 😮
Best to let Darwin make his collection, the gene pool needs some cleansing.
If an Australian says that it's a dangerous animal, it's probably a lovecraftian nighmare...
If an Australian is telling you hey that's maybe not a good idea, that's not a good idea.
Its hard doing this in florida and gators are dumb crocodile are smart and will hunt humans
I feel the same way seeing anyone swimming in the sea because of sharks 🦈
Northern Australia seems like a place were it seems like there are lots of great places to swim where you really shouldn't be swimming.
Me: starts chumming the water with bait🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Hey stop it! Cross gotta eat too
Did we learn nothing from Crocodile Dundee?
I am so glad they stopped to warn someone who very obviously was embarrassed by it, but hopefully got out of the water
Is the defensive guy British?  Seems like aussies know to stay out of the water in Queensland
don’t blame the crocodile is the realest thing i’ve ever heard! yes please make him take responsibility.
I was on holiday and I watched  a crocodile on a surfboard he only had 3 legs the locals told me he can swim but likes the surfboard and they give him food he had a better life than me
Bro, i would've trust a 3 inch puddle in Australia. Crocs everywhere.
Interesting how people can't believe fellow humans, even when the people are being completely sincere and concerned. Our governments and media and "news" couldn't possibly be to blame, at least a very big part of that blame, could they? With their labeling truth as misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, etc. and their "fact check" websites which are the equivalent of "It's true! Barry from the next block over told me so." Then 2 weeks later we find out it's BS, but we can't get mad and can barely remember afterwards because Putin says he's nuking us all and seriously this time and DOGE is firing every flight attendant, air traffic controller, and all but one pilot per jet.
The bloke wants to argue with him good grief no brains. That wet suit won’t protect ya.
Yeah mate if we warn about something, it’s not to protect you from cuddles. A croc’s kiss will make you dizzy and not the good kind
That’s Queensland😂
I wrote a short story about this very thing.  People can't even read a sign with pictures for this who can't read.
I would not even feel save on the spot where the men stands on concrete. Croc can jump far out the water.. 😅
Its free country ,mind your bussines and watch theSHOW!!! Woohooo!!!
Love 💕 and kindness  Soooo funny! Thank God for your persistence. Soooo difficult to save people from themselves
A soon to be Darwin Award nominee
Dumb and argumentative.  Not a good combo.
That’s how we feel in Florida with the tourists 😂😂😂 they have no clue 😅😅
Did he survive??😂😂😂
Perhaps he is or was suicidal.  Does anyone know what became of this?
Oh no 😮😮😮😮
What's the bloke's name? Might as well just get the Darwin award engraved now.
Idiot
Those signs are just there to scare people off from swimming 🏊‍♀️. Dude wasn't falling for it.
lol let people live... not everyone wants a boring mundane life...if it ends up costing them it , oh well. atleast they lived......until they didnt
Nah..  Those are just Lacoste rescue boats coming to help you.
Ppl are so dumb
I'm in danger.
"What Crocodile" "1 there, 1 there and 1 over there" It was at this time he knew..
Darwin award nominee..
As a floridian i feel his frustration. People will put their kids and dogs in our lakes and ponds at dusk. I seen a family pulling their children in a tube on lake jesup the most gator infested lake in central Florida around 5-6 pm😮
Listen when the tone spoke of telling you listen very well and closely. I'm sorry if somebody from that lands telling me look all these crocodiles I'll be begging to get on their boat and take me back please. Thank you or I ain't going to fight him on it scoot that
Just let darwinism play out mate
I’ve been to Darwin. Beautiful beach but I don’t remember seeing anybody get within 20 meters of the water.
Idc what anyone says Any drop of water in Australia I wouldn't go in it if you paid me!!! No way bro.
Dude, listen to your brother! Fudge!
Survival of the fittest just let them go. We're way overpopulated anyway folks come on❤❤❤😂😂
Survival of the fittest. Don't help morons especially wearing full body blue condoms.
Senseless people who dismiss warning ⚠️⚠️ signs and then the locals telling them of the Danger's. They are the reasons so many other's get Killed, harmed, or maimed.  OH well the Saying You Can't Fix Stupidity. Then comes too mind.
“You’re in North Queensland. Have some common sense.”
Australian man is telling the truth,  these kayak dummies put themselves in harm then blame the animal
Isn’t it funny that it’s called winning the “ Darwin Award”.
And when he gets eaten the crocodile gets vilified and captured and killed to get the man’s remains back. What a selfish person. It also wastes money in order to try to save him or retrieve his body.
"don't blame the _____ when you get done by it" I'ma start using that
Are there tRUMPTARDs in Australia.
Perfect example of how easy it is to explain thing do an idiot...pays to mind your own business..he was looking for a Darwin Award
This is how people gets killed by crocs, they just don't listen.
Listen to the locals lad 😂
She fall off a green screen movie boat..just look at the woman she def a couple fries short of a Happy meal lol
Time to get some popcorn, sit down and watch Darwinism at work.
This is every Facebook commenter who argues at crocs and sharks don’t attack people on purpose
Nobody wants to be saved. They want to left alone. Not by random or a government. Just save your breath let it be. If he don't come back then so be it.
If it's not a pool, don't go in the water in Australia
Its like half a paddleboard😂
Kind of like Trumps voters. We've warned you again and again. FAFO
Meanwhile the Crocodile secretly under the water soaking up the gossip
Dude in the blue gimp suit looks like he's had all his boosters aye
Dressed like a really big fish 😂 he was waiting to be dinner
Talking about Crocs while wearing Crocs 😂
Dude out on the paddle board sounds like every liberal I've ever spoken with. 🤣
As an American, I can say that Paul Hogan definitely educated me on this one.😂
Idiot😂
Let the crocodiles have him
This guy is probably a Trump voter on holiday. PLEASE stay in the water!!
I would be doing a Jesus on that water hearing the fear in that man's voice!
Idiot😂
paddle boy is a fool.
I didn’t know you get half SUP boards? Or is he on a little boogie board? Aussies naturally have good common sense, so trust them yo.
Good god
Why do people care what other people are doing crocs need to eat to
Might as well go to Iran or Pakistan and wear an American flag and a MAGA hat and walk the busiest streets
Sometimes, natural selection just needs to happen. Not enough chlorine in the gene pool.
And when he gets bitten, he'll scream there wasn't enough warning. There was plenty of warning, you just ignored it. Several times.
Someone once told me that never get in to the water if the place is unknown to you. Always ask the locals before venturing into water.
Why why why? Why people challenge life?
The irony of him in a full stinger suit though
I'm glad I don't have Crocs where I live. Went swimming in the river once and got warned about snapping turtles tho.
Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it 😂😂😂
Do people not realize Australia isn’t a human friendly place? It’s basically another planet the way species evolved over there.
After the blue Teletubby realized he didn't make the cut, he was never the same again
PADDLE BOARD GUY IS IDIOT
He looks like a big blue fish seriously he is splashing like a struggling  animal Delish😮
Just let nature take its course.
First time I watched the volume was down I thought he probably farted this is way better
Did anyone else have to mute the video when they heard that screeching sound of a female towards the end? Like finger nails on a painted dwarf. Horrible. Aha na it wasn’t that bad. I’m joking.
Let him do. Warn him and let him do
since this guy lived, there was obviously no crocs around as they are hyper aggressive. still an idiot.
Never argue with these kind of people they will drag you down
Where’s the sign. This is what the world has come to. No sign, must be fine. I agree with the boater- have some common sense. Do you really always need a sign to tell you the obvious.
Can't stand hearing Australian accent, makes your ears bleed.
Don’t yell at him! He’s just a big, delicious blueberry! - Croc
Mind your own F#$king business
We have idiots like this and when something happens they hunt and gut the animal 🤦‍♂️
“I’m from New York!! What!? This dangerous!?!?”😏👊🏿🫵🏿🖕🏿
;D ;D ;D
Bro stepped in right into his su1c1d3 plan
Live dangerously and foget to yell, accept your faith Mmmmm delicious said this crocodile 😊
This gives “I am a bomb technician. If you see me running try to keep up” Vibes
This f***ing idiot in his little blue wet suit using the smallest board he possibly could 😂
"Where is the sign,?" "Aye, aye..in Heavens."
Who cares? Leave him alone. If he get eaten, its on him
100% this smurf didn't make it to 2025.
He's wearing Crocs. META.
No way it's australia you got to be double careful.
Foolish tourists  No wonder they get eaten.
Heck even the snakes chase you in Aussieland
I came, and stayed, for the comments.
Must be down under no one knows how to work a camera phone.
😂😂😂 😂
wheres the sign?   one there, one there, one there, one over there, another here..🤣🤣
I'm gonna guess that's a boomer on that board. Checks out.
just leave the guy alone!! people love to animal-shame. its not all well-intentioned, more of an ego trip. if he wants to get eaten let him!!
Shame on them for unsafe paddling.  Shame on you for shaming them on video.  You're fishing without a pole.
Austryan mate, hold the camera upright mate.
I would only swim in a pool in Australia.
Fish bait.  Blue flavor
North Queensland,  not only  crocs ,   box jelly  fish, irukandji,  blue ring octopus , sharks , snakes,  spiders and humidity that  can dehydrate you.
At a f’n boat ramp !!!!  Crocs favourite haunt with all that fish offal from fishermen!
And the Darwin award goes to...
Croc bait 🤗👍
😂😂😂😂
Idiot
Having survived a crocodile attack in South America I find this man to be extremely infuriating.
You tried.
Remember: common sense is the less common of the senses!
When an Australian orders a late I think of crocodiles. Imagine them saying “you’re in North Queensland mate”.
When I was in Carins fishing for barramundi, two big crocs tried to attack the boat I was in., fortunately I saw them coming and was able to motor away.  If I had been on a board like that guy, I wouldn't be typing this.
common sense, a weird word for some fellas nowadays...
Ciry slickers.....pfftt
Hahahaha
just let the man swim
I feel like Florida and Australia are long lost brothers lol
We went to Cape Tribulation and there was this old guy just wading into the ocean to wash some mandarins. He risked his life to wash something that doesn't even need washed. Always stay at least 5 metres away from any water source up north.
How tf you gonna argue with someone even saying the word crocodile?
I’ve said this before  If it was shark infested waters not as big a deal but Crocs No way
His an adult let him do whatever he wants if he wants to die let him
Relax mate. He’s wearing the test version of a new crocodile resistant jumpsuit.
😂😂😂
Bait
As a born and bred Australian,  i can tell you that most of us call this kind of stupidity natural selection. 😂
If hes Aussie let him be, more air for us to breath.
I can see why he doesn't want to get out of the water. Paddling on your knees in a full wet suit on a 4 foot board 12 feet from shore at .04 knots looks like so much fun!
Idiot said "yeah right" after being told that crocs like to hang out around the ramp. This dude is about 8 paddles away from screaming "help me"
I would have asked a local before going near the water.
This idiot on the board reminds me of Zelensky.
Pride, meet fall...
Crocodiles lives matter, feed them, Australians they’ve lost their freedoms anyways
It’s like reasoning with a Democrat.
Theirs too many land crazy things on the land in Australia, I cant imagine what is in the water
Always one
Crocs gotta eat too.
Bro is on a mission.
We need to send more Democrats to Australia
"Roight mate!"
HAHAHAHAHA YEEEE GO MATE....
A baby ate my dingoes
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it." My favorite line! Had me rollinxD
Let em find out the hard way.
It will be fun when a saltie and a bull shark team up
SOMEONE’S LOOKING FOR HIS DARWIN AWARD 🥇 🙄🤡.
Play silly games win silly prizes
Why do you care to warn a loser when signs are everywhere?!?!?
This is the crocs' environment and as the man said, Dont blame the crocs because youre the one thats being an idiot.
Where's the sign 😂😂😂😂 dumber than a bag of rocks 😂
F U K M. Let natural selection do it’s thing
Most Australian sentence of the year: “don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it”.
Always blame the crocodile 🐊
I feel like youve got to let this one go
Everyone knows crocs love blueberries.
I feel like aussies and us floridians are similar to an extent. We both do crazy things. So when an aussie or true floridian is scared to do something, you need to listen.
Common sense what is that to a man that doesn’t read or understand a drawing. This is a man that doesn’t listen, knows it all and doesn’t learn from his mistakes. I must give him some praise. That’s one cool jumpsuit you got on and the croc is going to find you a chewy morsel. 🎉
An australian telling you an animal is dangerous means its a carnivarous dinosaur now get out of the water before you are lunch...
Darwin Award winner
Dude is warning him about Crocs while wearing crocs…. Classic
Leave him alone. He obviously knows what he’s doing. He has his feet out of the water kneeling on the board. 😂
White men
Maybe he identifies as Captain Hook....
Dressed like that was enuff for him to be sacrificed, nah one sec he might be pretending to be a blue bottle
Just let him give himself a darwin award.
Winner of the Darwin award.
Australians aren't afraid of anything, if he's telling you to get out, get out
What, no activists complaining about the man in the boat  stereotyping crocodiles?
CROC:  Hey mate mind ya Business he's okay 👍 👍.. .
On second thoughts if you have a head left and can breath or scream we might consider letting you blame the croc....
It's called natural selection 😉  Let him be croc-food 🤷🏻‍♀️
This is the seafaring equivalent of someone who votes for Trump
Dont blame the croc when you get done by it 🤣🤣🤣
Who else hears the Bluey theme?
Interpreted he was actually saying politely "Oi Mate stop fuking around"
It’s just salt water crocodiles. You’re over reacting. Paddles away. 💀💀💀💀
Your FIRED CAMERA MAN
...same type of person who travels to K'gari (Fraser Island) and likes to pet and feed the cute little doggies that inhabit the island.
😂did yall see a 🐊 he was showing I didn’t
An old Aussie told me, “ If t’s warm don’t go in the water.”
😂 If an Aussie tells you to get out of the water, you dont argue you get out of the water 😂
Warning about crocs while wearing "Crocs" classic.
You can tell some people, others need to be shown
“Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it.” Thats the most Australian thing Ive eve heard!! 🏊🏻🐊😂🤣😂🤣
"If you are in the water in a place where crocs live, and there's no sign, it means it's safe, so mind your own business!"
What's that ticking noise?
Let Darwin works...
the sort of woman that argues with satnav…but I’m guessing not anymore..
😂😂😂
Darwin prize in progress
"Don't blame the crocodile, when you get done by it" 😂😂😂
The crocs: Ahhhhh BK delivers
Worst camera work ever
Don't talk to idiots. Just a waste of your time.
Come on ,smurf boy ! If an AUSTRALIAN tells you "it's dangerous" , you don't think twice you go back to your home ,lock yourself in your private bunker and wait for the apocalypse !! Come on even God himself, armed AUS animals with venoms and all kind of deadly things just so they can survive aussies ! 😅
As a crocodile, I really wished the cameraman was a little less of a snitch
😑🙏✝️
Is that guy in a gimp suit?
Never seen such or heard such a pussie aussie its wierd..
I mean the dude filming sounds like an annoying hick and is one of those people to film everything it seems. Gonna say both are morons
Two blokes being friendly
I had a guy once try to pet a moose. We had to raise our voices talking him out of it
He got eaten just after this video. 😢
Bloke is crazy. Ya heard him say it's North Queensland mate!
If an Australian tells me its dangerous, im listening😂 theyre even crazier than us Alaskans
Its ironic that he is upset at the man.
🤣 But he's got a full wetsuit on!
When us dum Americans go on vacation 😂don’t b tellin us what to do. We waited our whole lives to die on vacation lol 😂
He's perfectly safe. Crocodiles don't eat smurfs.
That's dangerous and all, but have you ever swam in _shart_ infested waters?
Salties are no Joke !!
Incoming Darwin Award.
sad times when people have to film every human encounter they have
guys got the survival instincts of a lemming.
bye bye dumb dumb
Man I would of gave him one warning that’s it he’s a grown ahh man he knows how to work he’s brain
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is both hysterical and scary
Reminds me of the first Incredibles movie when the superhero is getting sued in court for saving a suicidal man. “Hey! I saved your life!” “No you didn’t you ruined my death!” 😳😬🤔
Yikes. Dude FFS listen to the locals!
True that...
Crazy how tourists still choose to visit dystopian and authoritarian Australia. Did they forget how insane Aussies acted during the WuFlu?
Australian government fined everyone in this video for not being masked up. They probably even vaxxed the crocs.
no wonder uk gets invaded by islam, they clearly too naive.
Dumb bloke 😂. He’s trying to save your life!
If a local warns you, listen. If a local Aussie warns you, take action.
Let's see him paddle like that in Florida! 😂
First the guy says he is fully aware then he asked, wheres the sign? Lol okay bate.
If getting warned about crocs by auzzy u better fukin listen
Stupidity must be spontaneously generated at birth since after all these thousands of years natural selection hasn't weeded it out.
It amazes me how arrogant tourists can be when visiting areas they didn't grow up  in. Locals start off being nice, trying to warn them about local dangers ..like known rips , wildlife, thieves, rockfalls etc. And very big hungry lurkers at frequent boat ramps or surfcasting spots..common sense things. But nooooo...the tourists Don't bother reading up before traveling to unknown spots..and act like jerks when locals try to warn em... they kinda deserve natural selection with their arrogant attitude.  Unfortunately it's locals and emergency crews who get to view the gruesome results of stupidity 😕 😒 🙄 😑
Live bait gets the best results.👍
What is he wearing? A speedskating suit??😊
Fafo
Hey Darwinism at work.  Enough said.
Darwin Award coming
The outdoorsy version of crossing the road looking at your phone...
Never interrupt food when it's on a mission!
Plot Twist: The dude wipes him out with one of his shoes.
"danger danger danger" in a Steve Irwin voice.
Please, mind your own business.  If he’s not going to hurt anyone else but himself, by all means, let the poor crocodiles eat.  You don’t go around snatching zebras from lions when they get caught?
The bloke on the board looks like what a teletubby and a wiggle had a child.
Was he an Aussie the suicidal guy?
I bet they've never had a smurf before.
The American croc & American alligator are big puppies ( relatively speaking) compared to saltwater crocs & nile croc species😭 Please don’t mess around with salties my fellow Americans. It’s worse across the pond.
If the croc gets close he won’t even see it coming. When a ausie tells you get out you get out
It’s alright people in Florida doing that everyday
That's  what's nice about natural selection! Idiot's hopefully don't live long enough to pollute the gene pool!!!
Just let Evolution do its Thing 😅
*GOD BLESS THE AUSSIE MAN*  *THE BIBLE SAYS IN PROVERBS,  THE FOOL DESPISES BEING CORRECTED*
Some people are just like that 🤔😳😠
Maybe he was trying to catch one using himself as bait?
“Crocs love the boat ramp…they hang around waiting for fish” “Yeah righto” 😂😂😂
He says when you get done by it, don’t blame the crocodile. I love how Australians talk the other day. I heard a guy say he called out of work doing a something day I can’t remember it for the life of me right now, but it made me laugh…. Maybe an Australian in the comments here can tell me. Australians just seem like good people for the most part.
It’s ok, he had a Kevlar stinger suit on 😂
He'll be using that boogie board to boogie if what that guy is saying is true 😂
Definitely democrat
Hey man, the guys safety is his own responsibility. "Just dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it". Thats words to live by right there.
I love how Australian speak. It’s cool af
Croc doesn't care about the sign either mate.
Soon to be Darwin Award winner.
Bahahahahahaha,  where's the signs......you can lead a horse to water..!?
This is the rare situation where it's okay to record. In fact, it's scientific as it displays natural selection.
Do you really have to tolerate this arrogance and ignorance? Even my uninformed 🇺🇸 self knows to listen. Your graciousness is recognized 👏✌️
What a bunch of crock😂
Dud...we Brazilians are also crazy...but even us would listen when a Australian or a Russian says that something is crazier than they can advise.
You warned him , don't argue with him , get your chair , popcorn , and camera ready for something that will soon be going viral , morbid but true , branedead !iberals!
He ain’t gonna be around to complain about the crocs 😵‍💫
I guess some people don't want to live.
He needs a sign ? And the good guy points at three…
When your ego is huge it robs the brain of oxygen.
Any body of water in Australia … Nope
Betcha a steak dinner that he's a liberal...
😂😂😂😂  🐊
This is a lot like when people try to tell people about sin 😅
Darwin award being processed....
Thats Yorkeys Marina.  People SUP there all the time and SUP surf just around the corner.  What a big deal that guy is making.  At least he's wearing a stinger suit.
Guy just needed a womans voice. Men arent good enough to save his life apparently 🤦
what a f head
Australians are a different kind of breed - you guys are brave !   All of the animals - and you all just live side by side -
This man has a death wish.
Why you didn't keep the camera on and cameraman
"Let me get myself killed!"
Croc "Mate, do I come over and smack the dinner out of your mouth!?, leave him be"
Anything THAT particular Aussie accents says I believe😊
That the OP had the decency to even take the time to warn the idiot is good enough. I honestly wouldn't have bothered.
Where is the sign?! Here is your sign, mate.
Dude was in his F.A. phase. I hope he did not have to transition to the F.O. part.
90% of the video is the ground, "where's the sign?" "1 there 1 there 1 there" ZERO signs filmed. So helpful for context.
Stop interfering with natural selection.
So his logic seems to be that the crocodile is only dangerous if the correct signs are in place.  What a smart guy.
You won't catch me anywhere in Australia let alone in the water or bush.
They love boat ramps?  What part about 16 ft reptiles hanging around your launch/land point expecting food made you think it wasn't a problem?
Must be a liberal
Sounds like all the MAGA voters
Yeah, Death Wish - Even in Florida you have 20 foot alligators at GOLF COURSES!!!! So, I can just imagine what lurks in THAT water.
Did he survive or got eaten by the croc?
Pride goeth before...  I hope he chooses wisdom.  🙏
Leave the socialists alone! We have interfered in natural selection for too long. That's how we ended up with so many woke people in the first place!
This level of stupidity is infuriating!!!!!
🤨 ppl just getting to dumb
Plot twist: MFS a merman
Future Darwin award...
Hey let justin bieber swim with tge fishs and crocodile..his pants are up for once
stay quiet, chum the water, film the action, go viral, make likes and money
Good Samaritan: don't do it Women: don't do it Man: let me do my thing 😤 Crocs: let him do his thing 😤
Splash louder with your hand paddling mate 🤣
you Know that even after that exchange,if a croc grabbed the clown,bro would've been straight in to save him
Is this bloke...... Dumb?
Keep going Smurf dude, we need population control 😂
Just last week up at Aurukun North Queensland they found a missing bloke inside a crocodile,
yep, the second croc beside the first is like "good on ya"
Anytime Crocodile Dundee says beware of the crocodile then you should listen.
Too be fair, Karens ruined it for heros😂
As a Florida man growing up playing in the lakes and rivers. I refuse to let some scaly lizard take my water from me. I surfed in Costa Rica with 16' crocodiles out in the surf next to me at a river mouth.  Crocodiles are way more aggressive than gators. Russell
Australia is the most dangerous place.. listen!!
He has his Rights,
Oh my gosh, what is that guy doing? As an Australian, I am just so grateful for the bloke warning him.
Perhaps he wanted to die. Not for us to know what’s going on with him …if I had to guess maybe the wife drove him mad 😂
The guy might have been trying to commit suicide.  Suicide by crocodile isn’t likely but it’s possible.
I was swimming in Costa Rica and there was a lifeguard screaming at me, " Tiburon!" But I couldn't really understand what he was saying so I got out and walked up to him and then I heard him say one more time  " Tiburon". Well I thought back to my Spanish and then I remember that means shark.  So it was a good thing that I got out.
We really need to stop caring so much about Darwin award contestants.  Just let them do what they wanna do.
"Pff, where's the sign?" "Uh, there, there and there" is fn hilarious
Yeah nah yeah nah, she''ll be right he's wearing a stinger suit!
Like my dad always said:”a word to the wise should be sufficient”
I love the way aussies say SHAWK!
Anyone know how he’s getting on?
Blue Man is fully committed to winning his Darwin Award.
Why say anything? Just wait and then record! 😂
Seriously don’t blame the crocs mate their more Australian then we are 😂😂😂😂😂
If Australian warns you about something and with serious voice too, get the f out of there.
Salt water crocodiles love eating Smurf’s floating on trash can lids. Good luck to Papa Smurf. He should’ve asked that guy for a ride to shore.
I think that man on the board may have gotten “done by it.”
The planet needs a purge of stupidity so let it ride
We all know how Aussies act around deadly animals thanks to Steve Irwin RIP. So when an Aussie tells you hey mate you need to get out the water before you get hurt, you probably should 😂😂😂.
He is not worried because a Smurf has never been killed by a croc. Are are the odds for today?
I've never been to Australia but even I know you don't splash about the Top End
There's some know-it -all's out there
Maybe he is ready to end it. Sharks would also thin̈k he is a seal looking up. He has to know that.
What was the outcome?😮
I would’ve said “Have fun becoming crocodile s***!” 😂
Oh my friend, just keep calm and let the nature do it's thing😁
The Willfully ignorant are unbelievable sometimes, wonder if he made it out alive.
I am a firm believer that when self-entitled narcissists tempt fate like that and disrespect the people trying to help them, we should stop wasting our energy and let them roll the dice.
What is the purpose of this kneeboard anyway? Looks super gay
Natural selection at its finest.
This is like taking a drip in the Everglades and thinking it’s going to be a pleasant swim. Completely foolish.
You can lead this man to water , but you can't make him think !
Darwin award
Hope he smartened up and got out of the water :((❤
Crocs love blue fish
His ego is so big, he can’t tell that these people are warning him and not telling him what to do. Darwinism at its finest.
He's old and if he wants to go that way let him go people should be able to go out on their own terms I think he knows that there's crocs and sharks i think he knows alot more than this guy recording thinks he does  with age comes wisdom and knowledge  it might be his dream to go out fighting a crocodile or a shark everyone is different not everyone wants to pass away in their sleep
Did he survive?
Tourist in Australia 😂😂😂😂
And, he's not even German!
Evolution is action!
Darwinism....
Sometimes You can’t save people from themselves.
"when you get done by it" love the lingo
And ya wonder how it keeps happening.
This is like a Christian telling someone to repent
Difference between a shark and a croc. A croc will 10000% come up too you and try eat you. A shark may or may not be interested. But a croc will definately try
Just let the Darwin awards flow.
He's fully aware 🥴
I remember whenever I'm in north Queensland I always remember to have common sense
Please tell me there's a part 2?
The fact that the guy is dressed in a blue body suit with a weird cap does say a lot about his mental state,hence the gross unawareness of the danger he’s flirting with
Is there a video of him getting eaten ?
I wear crocs they aren't dangerous
Darwin must win.
He was so confident with that “Where’s the sign?” “One there, one there, and one there.”
Throw some chum in the water😂
Get the butterfly net
“Yeah, righto” 😂😂😂
Let natural selection run its course please!
Awe there should've been intended video i wanted to see the out come of the man in the onesie having a attitude
No common sence in that situations gets you removed from the gene pool
As an American, seen something that looks so similar to alligators, in the ocean is so surreal and very weird. I don’t know that I would ever get in the ocean in Australia, even if it was in a “safe part” or whatever they consider the area where people surf and swim. If an Australian is telling you something is dangerous, whether it be in the water, or on land. You believe them. They know. They’ve lived in danger their entire lives. And somehow survived.
The splashing isn't wise. You wouldn't want to be on that craft in an emergency. If it was you'd want to move slow.
...so did he make it ??? In Africa they get out of the car to take selfies with the Lions...it's gene pool editing, you can't stop Nature
😮
That's the same thing as when the good ol' boys in the hood tell you not to go down that block.😂
Blueys ,Crocs, Sharks, Australia has beautiful beaches you can't use😂
Survival of the fittest. Just let nature take it's course.
he's a fool indeed 😅
bet he gets a ton of likes on the vid he posts of him getting eaten, dressed as a smurf. being all smug.  i get it now. he just didnt understand what the bloke was yelling. get out of the smurfing water ya smurf. there are smurfing smurfs all over the smurf and they will smurf you.
Aussies are so aggressive.  There is no reason to belittle him.  Just tell him politely to get out of the water that there are crocodiles around.  Not hard.
You have to be absolutely tapped if an Australian is telling you watch out for the crocodiles and your response is like "Whatever". Insane!
Darwin Award getting prepared
He a fool....that man really tried warn him
The fact he is warning him but ALSO defending the crocodile… true Aussie.❤
Must be a Democrat 😂
F*cking skirts! I’d be more worried about the snakes you keep voting into parliament, I grew up swimming in croc and bull shark infested rivers yet not once did me or my mates get eaten. You’d be pretty unlucky although sure there’s still that small chance just channel your inner Dundee and she’ll be right mate.
I mean you tried, might as well follow him around with a camera now
Obviously this Beavis never watched Crocodile Dundee.
Great footage of the dock
For some reason, whenever I hear the words 'darwin award' I think of Australia. And I currently live in Florida.
This is nothing to a Florida man
My American husband when I took him to Cairns, would not listen to me and wanted to walk by the riverbank where they do river cruises in the Daintree.  I asked him for the car keys and let him go.   Suffice it to say he got back we went on a boat.   The first thing out of the guides mouth ‘we see people go walking on the river bank and we say it’s not if a Croc will attack but when’.  They’re watching all the time.  Husband now listens
Yeah, righto!
Good way to get rid of dumb, stubborn know it alls. Just don’t blame the crocodile. Good advice, mate.
Mate, what a drongo .
For a second I thought Queensland was in the UK, and I was wondering how tf they had salt water crocs up there. Makes alot more sense now 😂
Where’s the sign? He says. Go pet a polar bear man.
He said “ go swim out in the ocean but don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it lol
It's not just any crocodile, Salt waters crocodile please.. they live up to their name, salty monsters.
And also Australia is considered to have very shark infested waters 😮
Where I used to live it was just assumed there were crocs, caiman and sharks nipping at your heels at all times while in the water. We just kept on with our business and to my knowledge, no one was ever attacked. Although sometimes there was a deep sinking feeling in my gut that left me feeling like I was about to die.
Its a miracle humans have made it this far to be honest 😂
All he had to say to me was salt water crocodile. I immediately would have transformed into Jesus and started to walk on water😂
The reason he is still alive is two crocs are discussing ‘is it ok to eat a smurf or will we get poisoned”.
The boys are back (for real this time they swear)
You can't prove Darwin wrong.
Yap. We don’t want to watch you become a crocodile meal.
He definitely looks like howd you imagine 🎉
He should say thank you! Never under-estimate locals!!!
WHY IS HE DRESSED LIKE that 😅 Grown man in a hooded Smurf suit kneeling on a boogie board at a boat ramp!?😂😂😂
Idiot
I would just let Charles Darwin do his thing. Natural selection is one of the best teachers.
i don't know what's worse his costume or your lack of camera framing awareness
Science has proven the crocs that the only one thought that ever enters their mind is ‘hungry’.
Pretty sure that guy can't read
Listen to the locals, or you’ll become part of the folklore.
As much as I want to visit Australia, I will not ever swim in a natural body of water there! Swimming pools are just fine and even then I may ask questions! 😊
i hear an Aussie voice im evacuating McDonalds
Leave him to natural selection the idiot
You telling him mate!! Aussie love their crocs, dont blame them if u became lunch!! 😅👏🏼🫶🏽💯🤌🏼🤗🐊❤
Little does he know the croc seen recently sign is very up to date. If you look closely, you can still see the croc. Beautiful mate.
My dad always used to say “some people just have to learn the hard way”.
So annoyed, that guy stopped me from getting eaten by a crocodile
What a berk!
What is wrong with these people?
Seems line a male Karen making the video
Always take note (and advice) of locals
What a donut
I’m Australian; I’d let this bloke do his own thing and then watch Darwinism do its own thing, unfortunately being that old he’s still probably left his DNA in the gene pool…
Love that he is also wearing a stinger suit, so is conscious about them, but completely ignores all the warnings to never swim in a river/ocean in North Queensland!
Is the top water plug for a crocodile!
Stop croc-blocking mate!
Terrible post.  You gotta keep quiet and let the gators do their work.  I predict your content and views will improve.
Winner, winner croc dinner!😂 What an idiot! Derr!
That man is practicing to win the Darwin Awards….
young man wants to win a darwin award not be an olympian.  let him be.
A blue starter…..
Cameraman, you had ONE job
DARWIN AWARD nominee for sure! 🤣  M 🦘🏏😎
I’m from the US the last thing that I wanna do is get anywhere near a freaking crocodile! They are eating machines!
Arrogant idiot, I'm glad you caught it on video because that would have been dead crocks because of one dumb fool
What an absolute half-wit!
Can't save these Democrats
This dude is a cyclist when not paddling on his little board 100%. If not the arrogance the blue suit tipped me off.
Charles Darwin approves 👍
Listen to the locals.......😮
That's one compassionate aussie right there. I would've let that idiot win his well-earned Darwin award if he back talked me in this situation.
just get his name for his darwin award. i'm sure his next-of-kin will appreciate receiving it.
I can’t focus on their exchange 😂 everything about the paddler is just so comical
Another prospective winner of a Darwin Award!
Aussie stuff!
Natural selection at its finest
He gotten done by it soon after.
😂dudes like me in the Everglades
Darwin Award contender
His nickname is Chicken Wing.  He is willingly becoming dinner .
Croc: Oh look, a big blueberry!
Fukn QLD 😂😂😂😂
Typical to say no it isn’t… what is it? Backwards
Fk around and find out...ignirance is bliss for this dummeh🤣🤦‍♂️
Darwin award winner.
He went as close to Darwin as possible to collect his award in person.
The man with the blue gimp suit is either an idiot or he wants to have lunch with a crocodile.
Always listen to the locals! Especially Aussies, they have some scary things there and they know what they are talking about.  Just like if you go to Florida or the mountains in the U.S we have our predators if we tell you to do something then do it, unless you are prepared to face the consequences.
Maaaaate should let old mate find out for himself what and absolute tosspot!
Why is he cosplaying as Tingle from Zelda in croc waters
In San Diego, our tourists like to take naps underneath eroding sandcliffs ready to collapse at any second & they respond in a similar manner. Darwinism.
Croc 🐊 bait!
At first glance I read “Disabled man paddles in…..”.   Now I believe I read it correctly.
Guy is a D head
To argue with someone who is trying to save your life is wild
Fully aware that he is not accountable for his own actions if anytiing
😮😮😮😮😮
Dang ... Try to warn them and they argue, so ridiculous
Imagine "Yeah, righto" being your last words.
Hey if he doesn’t wanna listen, let natural selection do it’s thing
What a tool
Who cares if there's a sign or not. Crocs are wild animals.
Who needs a sign when an Australian is telling you it’s a bad idea?  You can bet I’d be learning to walk on water before he finished that sentence.
" you're in north Queensland mate have some common sense!" If i was to visit Australia i wouldn't even paddle in the bath!
Probably Murican…..lol
Imagine getting eaten alive hearing your bones and tendons break and snap ...
Asking where the signs are when there's a ton.
Paddle boarder: “yeah alright let me do my thing.” Crocs: “thank you, let us do our thing”  He was shat out some days later after digestion.
*The locals know best, mate—lo-cal(l) can tell when you're about to be lunch!*  🤣😂🐊🇦🇺
In Australia the only thing more dangerous than the land is the water
Bro just let him go. Let natural selection do its thing and stop interfering with nature.
Crocodile's favorite type of human
At first, he says that he’s fully aware of it, and then he says where is the sign? Duhhhh.
What kind of a person argues when a local tells them of dangerous crocodiles lurking in the waters! 🤔🤪
"Just let me do my thing." Maybe his "thing" is getting chomped.
Probably a Democrat tourist,even a crocodile won’t eat them,too bitter and distasteful.
As an American this sounds like Florida man
Maybe he wants to go, to crocodile heaven
I like how the paddler is insulted by someone looking out for his life. It's ok, he'll win a Darwin award.
The fact that he got mad at the person that was trying to save his life tells me he didn't deserve that warning. He can keep paddling for all I care...
Woman: Yeah it's true! The crocs love the boat ramps!  Deathwish: ughh 🙄  😂😂
Did the croc get him🤔
And the 2025 Darwin's award goes to...
Yeh, just watched a documentary on saltwater crocs, aint no way i would be anywhere near, those animals are boss.
Just seen JRE talking about  crocs eating 1000 Japanese troops retreating across a swamp. Cones to something when you argue with someone trying to save your life.. 😮
Sometimes... You just let natural selection do some selecting
I mean he’s wearing camouflage. Things should be fine
Mind your business 😂
Multiple people, unrelated, are warning you to get out of the water… this is not a prank, get out of the water! 😂
Croc bait
The most Australian thing I've seen
This is how i feel every election season.
Ole gezza should listen to the wise man in crocs
"What about sharks?" - "Nah mate, no sharks around here ... (sotto voce) crocs ate them all".
The process of natural selection
When you have locals saying your endanger you need to bloodly listen.
What a smart dude lol😂😂😂😂
Smurf life savers.
Don’t say a word, just let natural selection take care of business.
Natural selection is still alive and doing well.
Classic
Aw man I thought we were gonna get to see something memorable lol
Thing is though, the IDIOT is wearing a STINGER SUIT. He is more worried about Jellyfish than Croc's. Let the Halfwit be, the crocs need to be fed. Coming to you from Normanton QLD.
Dude ,kick back, watch and record the Darwin Award ! Some genetics just arnt meant to prevail.
And the tryouts for a Darwin Award continue.
Crocodiles aside, how is what he is doing any fun at all?
Im really not sure what that guy was actually doing.
Let him go its nature…Darwins Natural selection.
Darwin Award waiting to happen.
He has no paddle? It also looks like a knee board you would ride on while being towed? It isn't a paddleboard. Very strange all around.
Betting this idiot dude is American, yikes I'm getting secondhand embarrassment
Seriously let nature takes its course or better yet turn😂 The gene pool already needs more chlorine let nature fix things naturally 😊
Note to self- Stay tf away from Australia
All that guy is trying to do is be the first person to win a Darwin Award while dressed like a Smurf.
Croc be like, "Leave the smurf be mate, I've got his back!" 🐊
I honestly probably would have popped some popcorn and sat there and watched the guy already knew what he was getting into
He’s disguised himself as a blue elf so safe from crocs (or is it DEW?) 😂
Asians know best 😂
Idiot
Ignoring locals is a smart thing to do😂
Evolution doing its thing i see💀😭
Natural selection, let this guys genes leave the pool.
You can't educate mugs ! A word to the wise......If you think sharks are unpredictable, and are to be feared, salt water crocodiles WILL attack sharks.
You can hear the seriousness of their voices... the complete opposite of a Karen
Yes!  Don’t blame the crocodile 👏👍
I wouldn’t swim in any body of water in Australia.
If it's too dangerous for an Australian, you are in waaay over your head... 😅
There are some people too hardheaded and have to find out for themselves.
🐊🤫
The sign said “no swimming crocodiles”, he thought it was telling the crocodiles not to swim. Honest mistake.
Common sense? 😂 Very rare those days..🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
There’s an idiot for ya!! No common sense!
Seriously some people just love to be minus some intellectual Braun cells
Just let him be mate………. But keep filming please
For whatever reason this reminds me of all those videos of Russians playing around with random bears they find
Idiot
He wasted a great video opportunity
It was only a matter of time. He was lucky this man told him something
Even being urgently warned about imminent death sounds chill af in Australian.
Also it is well documented that crocodiles hate Smurf’s and will attack them every chance they get.
The croc is in the water is showing hand signs across it's mouth to zip it to the guy in the boat.
Far North Queenslanders should let foreigners alone. Stop bossing them and warning them. If they want to die then let them. You are not forced to rescue them. Let the poor foreigners learn the hard way. When the man say "Leave me to do my thing and you do yours." then let him alone. When he is bitten and he screams for help you leave him alone. Live and let die,
Ah yeah - the crocodiles respect the signs. If there’s no sign they won’t go there
Ha just wants to feed the crocs
Its amazing he reached that age
“An idiot is born everyday”  -some smart person.
Natural selection at work. Don't waste your breath.
Crocs and box jellyfish. Hoomans have no business sharing their water.
That's the smallest SUP(..?) board I've ever seen. 😂
Idiot
His meds weren't working , his Suicidal Tendency was kicking in.
Surprised he wasn't wearing a mask.
'Yeah, righto'....how about, 'thanks mate'. Ingrate.
Here we are again, at the corner of Ignorance and Arrogance.
The man is wearing Crocs, clearly an expert on crocodiles. You better listen up old man
Perfect time to say nothing and just film. natural selection at work
Man.. society is seriously killing common sense and logic. Its too bad its these idiots that give crocs or other animals bad names. Im honestly terrified to see what people are like in 10-20 years. 💀
I'm a Floridian and I too defend my crocodilians!
The full body rashie that guy has on is nuts… not to mention he’s on a 4ft kneeboard😂 Dude is cooked if a croc spots him
You do you and let me do being a dicc 😂
Darwin
He is probably part of a Gucci leather handbag by now
Maybe that's how he wants to leave this world. 🤷🏻‍♀️
The poor fella’s just trying to win a Darwin Award
I wouldn't normally advocate for someone to stand by recording while someone's life is in danger, but this just might be an exception.
Surely he would have only lasted like 30 mins max before he got done right?
Nom nom nom
I never looked at it that way, fair point.
Dont blame the croc when you get done by it. Fair enough.
Florida too Mate❤
Oh whatever! Mind your own business! He’s not going to be able to blame anyone if a he gets done by a croc.
Ironic how the onlooker mocks the paddler for lacking ‘common sense,’ but it’s not common sense if you don’t know! Assuming everyone knows about crocs in North Queensland or has read signs they haven’t seen is itself a lack of common sense. You can’t know what you don’t know.
American-level microwave brain.
What an idiot!
I cant scream this loud enough! A HUMAN IS STANDING THERE TELLING YOU THERE ARE CROCS IN THE WATERS YOU ARE CURRENTLY DEEPING YOUR HANDS IN AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR A SIGN!!! 😂😂😂😊
If an "Australian" tells you that he's concerned about "ANYTHING!!!" Pls listen to him smh🤦🤦🤦I mean when have they ever been wrong???😂😂😂💯💯💯
An Australian came into my yard and told me to watch out for something in my yard. I would still listen. 😂
Very surprised it was not Chinese or Spanish foreigners swimming in there, they do not bother to read anything in English and if you try to explain to them “rules” they will say they don’t speak English..
Let him be. It’s no one’s job to protect him. He has free will. Let him be.
Maybe the idiot had a death wish?
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"😂
Aussie yelling at u about common sense? Oh man, UB tooooopid.
Uneducated idiots,and first to complain if the survived
Give him one warning and let him be.... don't argue to save him. Sit back and get some popcorn....
Idiots cannot be saved! Crocs love them! Yummy!
….acts like a liberal
Natural selection, y’all. Just let it happen…
Morons of the world unite!
the guy on the paddle is also aussie?!🤯 just not local me thinks.
The kneeboard guy is a scientist, studying the lining of crocodile stomachs
Soooo. Even an Aussie can be an idiot.
What a div 😂😂😂
I'd love to visit Australia one day, particularly the Northern Territory and Queensland. Is it not safe at all to swim in these waters then?
I love a bit of good old fashioned natural selection.
Well, after this heated conversation he quickly goes to the shore believe me
Why are we watching a video of a bloke recording concrete?
the World are Full of Idiots like Him! Sad 2 Say!
Free feed for a croc, looks like a blue seal😂
“You’re in North Queensland mate” is all I needed to hear.
Lol 😂😂
There’s atleast 2 crocs in this video
Listen to the man Karen😂he’s giving you a warning “you are alligator bait”
When an Australian warns you. Listen!
Let that entreé paddle!
Those signs were actually referring to the camera mans shoes
Wznjer go pat the croc dhead
Croc proof suit. Duh 🙄
This would be literally me n my son 😅
Right, argue with a local who is trying to save your life. 😂😂😂
My mother was visiting my brother in Darwin and she told me about a trip they took to a local river. They saw some kids in the water, American mother sitting on the side. My mum told her to get her kids out immediately, the woman was a bit dismissive until my mother pointed to the sign warning about crocs in the water that she had completely ignored. They got the kids out safely and only then noticed a few snouts not too far from where the kids were playing. People are dumb.
Went to Monkey Mia, Western Australia, no locals would enter the water only tourists.  Turned out there were sting ray hidden in the sand.  On the way out of there stopped at a garage, the young guy had a big scar on his leg beneath the knee, had been struck by the tail of a stingray.  Motto of this story:  If the locals don't go in the water neither should you.
Probably an American. Dumbest people on earth.
What a wally. I agree with the Aussie warning him. Don’t blame the croc when you get done.
Blue man: "Where's the signs?" Local ozzy dude: "There, there and there mate." Blue man: "They are very old signs." Enough said. At least he took the advice in the end by saying 'righto'.
Australians are the best
I am from North Queensland.  That tourist is unbelievable 😢
Aah...wait to see Croc get up close and personal😂
Darwin would be proud.
Why would you go in any water in Australia 😮
How can an Australian not know that?! I am not Aussie and I know it!
So when the guy with the camera is talking about dangerous “ crocs” I’m assuming he means animals and not his shoes??
As a floridian we swim with gators all the time. But I don't mess with crocs at all.
Let nature do its thing bud. You helping the idiot is doing the rest of us a disservice.
Where’s the sign? As if without the sign the crocs magically vanish. They only show up when there’s a sign present. Dumbazz
Just pull out the popcorn and watch the show 🤷‍♂️
and here comes another nominee for a Darwin Award!
dementia?
Dumb humans probably taste the best...
As an American literally the only thing I know about North Queensland is that they supposedly have loads of crocodile attacks there
One time I was in FNQ having a Disney channel moment sitting by the water under a wharf and a guy going past in a tinnie yelled something about a croc sighting at me and I fear he saved me from a very very embarrassing death
Yomp.
This man is so nice to this idiot!!! ❤
Where is the sign?😂😂😂 Where is common sense?
I would have listened to that guy so quick lol i would look like a cartoon getting out of that water LOL
As soon as you see he's dressed in a comical blue smurf outfit you know you cannot take this guy seriously 😮
Yeah if a person with an Australian accent is saying don't go in there it's dangerous I'm gonna listen 😮😅 it's a hard pass for me I wouldn't be anywhere near that water.
Croc love white meat.   And that's a fact.😅
I love that Brits and Australians are violently sarcastic
thanks for filming the ground, because I was really wondering what you were standing on
Crocs love smurfs
There is NO WAY paddleboard guy is Aussie.
You wouldnt catch me in any kind of water in Australia
Aussies are literally standard in identifying what's a real danger! So if they say bloke thats probably not a good idea...Im gonna take their word on it!
American logic 😂😂
That Smurf is bat $hit crazy.
Especially in North Queensland so much danger
"Misinformation!"
Natural selection right there folks.
The hazards of being an Australian are unmatched.. if they warn you, listen.. these folks witness shark attacks and other fatal encounters with wild animals daily ..
Honestly these days I wouldn't say a word..they wanna get eaten that's on them
Well?? Did he become lunch?
If an ozzy is telling you to have common scene you must be acting a fool
Strongest contender for Darwin Award this year.
People are dumb....
This is like the ignored warning given by the old guy in slasher movies.
And this is a clear demonstration of the Darwin Award candidate hard at work!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is why tourists go missing regularly 😂
If the croc dundee says so… better run
❤❤❤
Its Australia these people dont do health and safety get out the water.
Got to be a Pom😂😂😂
Australians live in a nightmare land of evil critters, if theyre wary, you should be terrified. Always listen to the Aussie. They fesr very little so if they warn you , you should probably listen.
People generally hate nosey people regardless of the situation lol
I was hoping a croc was gonna pop up and go "they're right, mate"
The crocs might get him but at least he's got a UV suit on. 😂
Darwin award in process
Let him be him,   You’ll get to watch the real Darwinism effect in action.
Natural selection
Fearmongering
bro you just ruined an insane footage, you should let him swim!
This reminds me of the lady who got eaten by a croc in 1986 in Queensland.
Democrat voter. No common sense.
His shoes look like crocks too, mans a crock expert id listen
Prime mind your business moment
A whole generation born without survival instincts. I wonder how that will turn out.
are we not gonna talk about his weird method of locomotion?
Natural Selection in progress.
This is where you don’t want to say “Told you so!”  🐊 😊
Give the guy a break, he is competing for the Darwin Awards!
One of those guys who thinks he's right and the world is an open and free place.  Guys, animals are just mobs in a video game. No real danger.
Yep this is true. pretty much from bundaberg onward is where you will have to consider them being in a body of water. not every log is a log!!. Take care while travelling here and definitely take the locals advice  plus we have dangerous rips to.
dressing up like a blue teletubby might apparently work, i haven't heard about this guy being eaten yet.
“I’m trying to keep you alive”  “But I don’t see the signs for that”
Australian man yelling at Florida man.
The gene pool has a way of working
Darwin award
A floating blue berry croc treat!!!
I mean I’d give the man a proper heads up as what he’s getting into…. But if he wants to FAFO,  who am I to stop him?
I was in Bimini off the resort on a beautiful piece of beach, swimming with my son and a friend.   All of a sudden a native gentleman came to the water and screamed at the children in the water there.  He proceeded to beat their bits and they all ran away, crying. I know he was aware of something we were not aware of! Never forgot that day.
We have a lot of guys just like him here in the USA.
The line is “you’re ANYWHERE in Australia. Don’t go outside or inside or in the water or out of the water. You’ll die”
He just wants to see the crocodile's smiling face!
How did he live to get that old?
I am so scared of crocodiles, I traveled to Sarawak South Malaysia and we went for a trip to an island, when we got to the dock there were signs everywhere to beware of crocodiles 😮 the boat was quite small I was very aware indeed!
It's the cutest thing to watch, an irresponsible person being confronted with accountability.
I just getting more and more confused. Sitting here at 37 and wondering. Autistic, adhd? I don't know anything anymore. I might be put in que for assessment soon. Fingers crossed. So much makes sense with npf but then again not. I feel like I don't know myself anymore, but then again... did I ever?
...dum, dum
that's natural selection at work
The Australian Grizzlyman. BTW, was anyone able to assemble this man's complete life based solely on this short video? Did he have a dad? Who did he vote for? What type of work did he do for a living? Does he like to use the word 'fascist'?
If you need a sign to tell you whether it’s safe ya doin it wrong ya muppet.
Is that someone from the Blueman Group or a smurf?
Let natural selection do it's thing 🤷‍♂️
Australians know about what’s dangerous. If they’re freakin’ out, best to listen and follow their instructions.
He's not looking out for the guy, he's looking out for the crocs... He doesn't want to see them get blamed. Lol
“Don’t blame the crocodile, when you get done by it”🤣🤣
Of all the things an Aussie knows it is dangerous animals and which ones should not be tested.
Reminds me of The Far Side cartoon of the happy crocodiles sunning themselves next to a ripped up pile of clothes, “that was magnificent! No fur, fangs, claws, or horns! Just soft and pink”.
To be fair. There is 16 people killed by crocs sine 69 in QLD. There is at most 5 attacks per year in QLD. QLD is a f** big place. More people is killed and harmed on QLD roads every year.  I guess, if you somewhat have some knowledge about this, then I guess that even reduce the risk more. Crocs are terrible hunters really. Ofc they are bad when you are unlucky.
Natural Selection at work
CROCS DONT EAT SMURF 😂
Future Darwin award winner
Natural selection at work
Funny how the paddler responds with being hostile and tells him to mind his own business but towards the end starts to realise that he could be in some real danger. Why be hostile for someone looking out for you?! The dudes response was spot on though. "Yeah, you do you, but dont blame the croc when it gets ya"
Let nature take its course... 😂
As an ex-ocean lifeguard, I often found it hilarious when I was just offering free, life-saving advice, and the potential victim would complain that I was trying to restrict their personal freedom. My solution was just to let them go – – until minutes later, they started screaming for help!
What a nice video of your voice and concrete
We don't need his gene pool .
There’s no such thing as common sense
A Floridian would've just stay quiet and keep filming, waiting for the killer short 🤑
Darwin Award nominee right there. I wonder if he won?
I’m an Aussie and I’m in disbelief at this di*khead not listening to the locals. There are signs everywhere in Cairns. Last time I visited there a taxi driver ran over a croc on the way out to the airport!
If you are scared of crocks don't go swimming anywhere in QLD simple... But leave the swimmers alone we are here for a good time not a long time 🖕
bro look like he just walk off a movie studio w his blue suit
Tourists feeding the crocks 😂
Where's Ozzy Man, when we need him?
Use your brains All predators must not be messed with or invited by swimming in dangerous places USE THE BRAINS
I lived in far North Queensland for a few years and I couldn’t tell you how many times I have stopped to tell tourists not to swim in water they were already in. There are signs literally everywhere stating not to swim!
The man literally put himself on a platter
😂😂😂
When a Aussie tells you get out of the water GET OUT THE WATER!!!
Don't blame the 🐊 crocodile 🐊😂
Man in crocs warning c**ks about crocs
Natural selection
Iv warned swimmers in green water in N.T. near a lge trap with a big pig head in it. I used sign language. "Crocodiles here eat you. Get out. Look sign. Idiots."
You can't argue with fools hey ...let the crocs have em
As a native Floridian, that water is way too murky and the croc is probably right underneath him.
I seen a croc in the video 😂
And when he gets bit he will expect others to risk their lives to save him.
Let nature take its course 😅😅😅
The Smurf probably would have been more receptive if the cameraman didn't insult his intelligence while trying to advise him on how not to get eaten.   Offering advice while insulting someone's intelligence while also expecting them to actually be receptive of said advice, just doesn't make sense.   He said “have some common sense” like ppl are imbued with it by proximity and he just turned it down. He’s a Smurf what does the guy expect ?!
"I'm fully aware of it.....where's the signs..." does not sound like someone who's fully aware of anything. They come straight from Melbourne city and jump in the water thinking their Uni degree makes them smarter than nature.....
That's perfect videoing that, there's 1 there & there while looking at the floor, yep there everywhere, thanks 4 that
Crocodile Dundee knows what he is doing mate.
Crocodile Dundee knows what he is doing mate.
i would love to live in Australia just to listen to people talk hahahha.
What an idiot. Crocodile bait
That is absolutely mental
Crocodile Dumbo
All these people pretending they know a better way to die than a croc attack...
It's what usually happens, take any topic you wish. People hate being told what to do by poor people. Billionaires on the other hand, they must be listened to...
He's trying to save your life....sheeesh.
Let.     The.    man.     do.     what.    he.     want.      Go. ....ahead
He sounds Australian himself, maybe he's from Victoria?
FAFO???
Suicidal?
Natural Selection at work again.
darwin award
natural selection
Where is the follow-up vid of him getting eaten??
Did he die?
I missed the part where he rode the crocodile.
That man deserves a Darwin Award😂
The Aussie version of a leopard ate my face.
Swimming in crocodile infested water dressed up as a fish😂
Am I the only one who sees a man in Crocs warning another about Crocs? Talk about the fashion police!!!
Natural selection it is
I wonder how many ppl have met their demise being this clueless
Freakn knee boarder what do you expect?
The funniest thing is that this was at Trinity Beach, one of the highest croc population beaches in all of Cairns
That there is what we call a "temporary Australian", what a completely cluless f00l......
it's ok he's wearing a protective rashie
Complete Idiot .
It is called natural selection. Leave him alone 😅
When an Australian says "go ahead"...i have a feeling you should not go ahead.
Maybe thats why he went out there to begin with
Just keep swimmers 😅😂
Let natural selection do its job
This guy now knows how the city chipmunks feel, warning the mountain-dwelling newbie chipmunks about playing in the streets.😂
See you later, alligator, in a while, crocodile
The only body of water i'm entering in Florida or Australia is a bathtub. 😂
Natural Selection 😂
Go ahead,  mate.
Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it is so aussie to say 😂
Geezus leave the dude to do him. If he gets eatwn he gets eaten. And if he dont then he had an enjoyable day. And yeah i live in North Queensland 👌🥱😂
When a local Ozzie gives you a PSA for free like that, then listen.
Natural selection
Don't argue, get out of the water! Australians have instinct X training for sniffing out danger
Yeah if an Australian won't do it, it's a bad idea. Those folks will do some wild 💩
Did he get eaten by crocodile?
Darwinism works best without Hall monitors
Let’s address his body suit 😂
Just let natural selection take its course 👍
Straight to the f*cking point. Don't you just love the Aussies :).
And the camera man is wearing Crocs 😂
Let’s the croc  join the conversation
Must be an American
Did he get eaten???
😂😂😂😂😂😂
two types of Australian beautifully described here. should be in a montage with the “it’s an alpaca you fkin idiot” clip
Leave him alone!!  He’s just feeding the wildlife!!
It's a cute blue outfit tho
Have some common sence . Hahaha  ironisch
Survival of the fittest I guess....
Idiot
Wat a dumbarse
I was gonna say, I thought the swimmer was American… I wanted to apologize to the Australian citizens. Lol 😂 If it was an American, I was gonna say I’m sorry for his stubbornness. They don’t know what a salty is nor have they ever seen one.. Some American people just have to learn😂
When you're at the beach/lake, and there are people around, but NO ONE'S IN THE WATER... there's a reason!
Survival of the fittest...
Quit yelling at the guy.  Just keep the video going so you can sell the footage to the highest bidding network.
Natural selection in all it's glory.
Does anyone else see the irony that the dude filming is wearing ‘crocs’? 🤔
When an Australian tells me not to blame the crocodile, I'm blaming the crocodile.  I don't think Australians know about south America... or Florida 😂
You sometime we shouldn't fight against natural so much, let natural selection do its thing.
Everything is funny with an Australian accent.
The guy warning him about the crocs is WEARING crocs!  It's crocs all the way down!
What an idiot!  Only body of water you enter in Australia is a swimming pool even then I'm still cautious 😮
I think he does this to feel wanted😂
What is that guy even doing? He doesn't even have a paddle and has a bright blue wetsuit on like some sort of stupidity super hero. It's like he's purposely trying to flail about in the water to attract as many predators as possible. This is Darwin in action right here.
He had to argue back. 😂
The SPF50 suit doesn't repel salties. He's basically a  bonbon to crocs.
Maybe the blue camo suit will scare the crocs ? 😂
Whats a xxxxer. Listen to an ozzie when they say something is really going to harm u
What a fool ,good on ya for trying to help the fool
He sounds like Trump supporters 😂
We swim in Florida.
Must be a crocodile proof board...😂
He the lady in the back ground  giving it to him
Don’t ceush his dream, he wants to win the Darwin awards 💀
He's gone to the effort of putting on a stinger suit cos he's worried about the Box jellies and the Irukandji... and yet he's splashing around on something the size of a wheelie bin lid in croc country. Some people are just fkin oxygen-thieves. This guy should not be allowed to breed.
Full sun protection at least   Loved his "yeah, righto
Bruhs too privileged he thinks he got 3xtra lives
Just let him be for gods sake
god why can't I find my worst enemy doing that??
Darwinize the gene pool! 🧬🐊
Future posthumus Darwin recipient. Guy looks like one of those Blue Meanies from the Yellow Submarine movie
Liberals be liberals
He’s the type to never be seen again.
Whatever 'craft' this guy is on and that outfit. It doesn't even look fun, let alone an activity worth risking ones life.
When death-defying Australians think YOU’RE the crazy, believe them.
The man should mind his own bees wax.   Crocodiles don't attack boats in broad daylight.
Swim suit guy translation : “what’s wrong with me wanting to die?”
Don't say anything, just keep rolling. The news will pay you for the video clip. 🎉
I dont even think the crocodile will want him dressed like that the 2nd hand embarrassment is just to much 😂😂
Let him earn his Darwin.
Some people don't know a warning if it slapped them in the face 🤦‍♂️😅
American for sure
🐊🍗😋
Best thing is, he is wearing crocs :D
Just the Sound of Australian accent alone means you're in the WRONG PLACE. LOL. LOVE.
Where's the sign he says. What a dumb bloke
The Australian man is just trying to protect the crocodiles. Because crocodiles are allergic to idiots.
I've never heard an Aussie say something was too dangerous before. That was chilling.
Some people are so dumb especially backpacker’s in Northern Australia 🇦🇺 stay out of water always
“I don’t see any signs.” Yeah that’s because the crocs took them down!
The common sense here is remaining quite after the first warning and letting the gene pool receive the cleansing it so desperately needs.
The gene pool will clean itself
I don't care where i am in this world,  doesn't even have to be Australia,  if an Aussie says it's a no then it IS A NO for me
He must be a liberal American.
you are a fish😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅.
Reminds me of the time I was in Garden of the God's hiking one of the beautiful trails...came upon a Park Ranger, she was holding folks back while a beautiful rattlesnake was crossing the trail (pretty sure it was a Mojave Green although they aren't supposed to be up there). A fellow came striding up behind me, pushing his way through those of us who were waiting for the snake to make its way across. I stepped in front of him to stop him as he clearly wasn't paying attention to anything other than shouldering past us and straight into the rattler. He was clearly upset with me, but I calmly explained that the Ranger (one the downhill side, we were uphill, of the snake) wanted us to wait until the snake was across & into the rocks. The man (in sandals) said "I'm from Arizona, we aren't afraid of snakes" and pushed past me (normally I wouldn't allow a man to do that, but I figured the snake could teach him a better lesson...so I let him go). Idiots will be idiots regardless of how much good advice we try to impart.
It's called natural selection.
While the guy in the water was oddly obstinate about not getting out despite the warning about crocs in the water, the guy recording this is pushing things too If it were me, if the guy in the water doesn't care then I wouldn't care and tell him that it's his funeral. I mean, it's not like the guy recording this didn't do his due diligence.
Hes easy pickings for a croc!
“where’s the sign mate”  “There, there, there and at every boat ramp”  😂😂😂
Darwin award…..
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it” True Dat!
Unreal  when someone’s kind Enough to help you stay Alive. ….  This guy is going to say the same thing…. 🤣 to the  Crocodile Look here Mate!!  “Let me do my thing and you do yours” last words!!!   then…. CHOMP…….. 😳 🐊
If Australians are scared then you should definitely shut your pants 😮
Won't be blaming a crocodile when you're done by it. No speaking will be done anymore.
Well I got to know the ending now! Did he listen and get out of did he stay in and become croc food
He wants to pet that dawg.
Survival of the fittest 🤦🏻‍♀️
Australians learned the hard way - so u don't  have to.
dopnt blame the crocrodile
"Don't try to Save  me from the Crock!" "How dare u try to help me not get eaten"🫣  Oh dear.
Did he get disabled from his last paddle out?
This guy is nuts but Steve Irwin was an Australian cultural icon.  Sure.
Good on you for putting up with this idiot.!
Florida Man visits Australia.
So thats where Filthy Frank went
Pride goeth before the fall into crocodile infested water
I love the comedians in the comments!!! That’s usually why I read comments…to laugh.
Well, I don't subscribe to the lie of evolution, but if that man does, he should be reconciled to the "survival of the fittest" contest results.
"Be careful there are crocodiles Everywhere around here" ...... "LEAVE ME ALONE!!" 🤨🥴🫡💀
Don't you know nobody's allowed to criticise a millennial in pursuit of some pathetic new experience whilst looking ridiculous?
The guy on the board is American MAGA.
Was he trying to mimic a blue groper…?
When your pride weighs more than your life.
Natural selection at its finest!
When an Australian says its dangerous.   Listen
I am Australian, and most Australians don't act like the guy filming. Most of us would just let that guy do whatever he wants, after all its no water off our back if a crocodile takes him out.   How this man and woman are almost aggressively trying to help him, is odd, I guess they really care a lot about some random stranger?
Let natural selection sort it out!
I was waiting for the and" 3 minutes later " video ! With the Crocs point of view ! Lol
What an idiot. Everyone knows not even the beaches are fkn safe..no body of water in NT and North Queensland are safe to swim in NONE
*I refuse to live in a place where humans are not at the top of the food chain.*
"Where's the sign?" This must be the first time this guy ever left a city in his entire life.
Duh Duh Duh Dumb Is You!!!😂 Lol
This men died after 38 minutes.
I’ve never been to North Queensland, but I know you don’t swim up there. I’m from Sydney
*He wants a darwin award!*
So what happened to him, was it his lucky day 😮
Work away mate
Assume any body of water in northern Australia has a croc in it
😂 go to what you want to do. 😂 dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it. 😂
Bait
I grew up in Florida swam in water with American alligators plenty however if I'm in a place with crocs especially salties I'm not taking a chance. Lol
And he is wearing crocs lol
Waste of breath trying to tell him.
He was not warning you for the fun of it!! Listen to what he is saying and then if you still want to be a fool and swim with the crocs go for it!! That’s up to you!!! 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Instead of admitting HE made a mistake and getting TF outta the water his ego and pride would rather chance him getting eaten alive notice HE asked where are the signs thus meaning HE didn’t fully understand the danger prior to
City folk
Nothing gets me out of water faster than an Aussie saying "what a beaut!". 😂
i have never seen someone so stubborn on having the right to be eaten alive by a 7 meters long  preistoric lizard
Video that ended too soon
Probably a Dicktorian..😅 Go for it dude.
Don't feed the Crocs!!!!!
My friends told somebody once not to go walking alone by the river in the evening in the South African bush.  He’s just arrived that day from Britain.  Unfortunately, …: My advice today is still don’t do it - and also don’t do it in the South African urban environment either.  Crocodiles aren’t usually the biggest thing you need to worry about - but sometimes might be.
When you hear an Australian man say something is dangerous then you know its dangerous
Freaking idiot.
He really just wanted to test his luck that day.😯 Just leave him be😂
At least hes sensible and got a skin protecting suit on
Stop getting in natures way man, its taking its course!
This man argued his right to be suicidal.
“I’m fully aware of it.”  20 seconds later, “Where’s the sign?” he says.  🙄🙄🙄
What a funny little man Darwinism at its best, just waiting to evolve though the genetics.
I don’t even take baths in Australia 🇦🇺
As an aussy, the guy on the paddle board can't be from here
Silly man
Might be better  if it was renamed  " North Crocodilland " as there is no Queen now and the giant Crocs " Reign" supreme.
Must be american.
Idiot
What a clown, ripe for a Darwin award
Papa Franku?
“Yes, I know…I came here to paddle one last time” - Blue Man Group guy
the Australian man knows what he is talking about. I nearly got myself killed in Nth Queensland walking on a crocodile infested beach and have never forgotten it. Listen when someone says crocodile it’s an awful death. Also credit to the man on the board he does have his body covered protecting him from Irukandji jellyfish, another deadly Australian animal.
Saltwater crocodiles are massive and very aggressive. This man is a fool. It will also be impossible to find one's dead body after the fact. They like to stash away their meat, and no divers will come looking for you in those waters. At least that's how they do it in the rivers.  They'll settle for fresh meat too.
Those crocs the cameraman is wearing are lethal
Just curious, is the man behind the lens on dryland?
Anybody from Oz at any age tells me NO, then I’m outa there…
When he pointed out the signs I thought he’d asked where’s the croc 😂
Gotta appreciate the irony of the man warning him of crocs is wearing Crocs. 😂
Eh let Darwinism thin the herd
Whatever the paddler is, he must be whatever is 1 level above Australian.
Show this guy some videos of Zebras crossing rivers in Africa
This is exactly what America feels like right now.
I live in the American South and we have alligators. I do not swim in the lakes around here. How someone could be in Australia and not pay attention to the signs when we all know Australia is a dangerous place baffles me.
Leave the poor guy alone. He has aright to be crocodile lunch. 😂
A fool and his life are soon parted...
"Where's the sign"....  There's 3 of them in the immediate vicinity... 🤕
Crocs haven’t survived 200,000,000 years without being the ultimate predator.  As an Aussie, salties just evoke such a primal fear and should be deeply respected.  Get in the ocean, a GW or Tiger shark may swim past you and you may never know. But you’ll always know if you’ve entered a crocs territory.
Egit.
Natural selection in action.
Bait bloke
Anyone else notice that the guy filming was wearing Crocs :) Full marks to the guy filming trying to save that clowns life.
I don’t go in or near the water in Australia. That’s why god made pools with fences around them
To be fair the crocs stay away when its not signed... 😂
🤌🤌🤌
Natural selection
ALWAYS listen to the local!!! As a born Southern FL Gulf Coast native who's home town also happens to be on the Caloosahatchee river, i cannot count how many tourists or transplants ignored me or other locals and died because of it. I've seen them get attacked by gators, sharks...cayman etc.
He got offended because someone saod have some common sense.
It’s called natural selection
Crocodile, "Yeah, nah.  I'm not eating anyone dressed like that."
White people thirsty for adventure. Only white people do these dumb things.😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂
Darwin Award activated. 🏆
Common sense isnt something you can earn a degree in. You either have it, or you don't. This is an example of someone who doesn’t
boomers
Natural selection at its finiest.....leave him be.
Just can't beleive some tourist's
Hitchhiking in Florida and having alligators look at me as lunch gave me a new perspective!😮
Darwinism in action.
Let em get eatin.
That's like when torrest come to swim at our beach next thing there is a chopper looking for a body
Live in S. Florida, we have alligator and lots of big crocs and bull sharks LOVE the brakish water of the mangroves. Used to be able to enjoy spring because water is typically 72 year round. Not anymore. They chomping on people in the springs. And boat ramps great place.
Yet to meet and overly cautious Ozzy
It's well known that if there is one thing that crocs cannot stand it is splashing like an animal in distress in murky water
After the video cut, Jason Voorhees came out of the water and got him instead.
He trusts his blue sausage skin
There is no part 2
FAFO...
That's why I never feel bad for fools that get "attacked." Some people refuse to use COMMON SENSE! It's called "Thinning The Herd."
Geez. Smh! 😮😮
When an Australian man is telling u …listen, mate.
He ams very smart. Ain't him.
I seen a pair of crocs at the end of the tape and they're attached to the cameraman 😂😂😂😂 for real though, don't swim or paddle in saltwater territory. They're more aggressive than the Nile Crocodile and a bite force equivalent to a tyrannosaurus rex
Pretty sure he got on the boat
Natural selection at work
crocodile: who's dat trying warning our food its not his business
I'm sure there are a lot of MAGA need to go swim there 😂
Clearly see the crock at 00:20 .
Actually, I have heard that crocodiles do not like the taste of Teletubbies. Especially blue ones. So this man would have in actual fact been ok.
Is he alive?
Leave him jesus lord
Hey be careful dinasour in the water , hey mind ya business , 😂
When I was a kid my dad tried to warn a tourist about handling a blue ringed octopus. “ how can this little thing hurt me “ he said, only after my mum screamed at him did he let it go. 💀
Dude picked the smallest thing he could to go into the merky tidal water on aswell 😂
Think he needs another sign .... "that's  a fu***en crocodile recently seen sign" 😂😂.
Bernie bro for sure
You did your duty by him with the warning. Now let him meet his fate.
These are the people who let tbeir government take their arms and lock them down for 2+ years for a sinus infection. Theyre not the smartest.
He's in the Blue Man Group, he can handle himself! Lol
Bro ur getting pissy with ppl trying to save your life, even if theyre wrong atleast show gratitude its just good manners, id have asked if the guy could gimme a lift bck to the beach, and wed have had a laugh at my stupidity😂😂😂
WHAT AN IDIOT!!!! 😂🤯
A stinger suit won't help .,.
Its actually another Aussie but from Syd  city or somewhere.  😅
An absolute idiot. If he were American I would say he voted for Trump
The fricken idiot wants to argue with people warning him about crocodiles.
Stop saving the st00p1d
"You think they just hang around waiting for fish"  Uhhh yeah, that's exactly what they do, and you're the guppie.
Go ahead mate
Your in north Queensland mate have some common sense
“Where’s the sign?”  Crocs don’t read the signs, champ.
What an idiot. Salt water crocs!
People do this sort of thing in FL all the time. Disregard that we have dangerous wildlife.
You can't put brains in statuest
Wouldnt even get in a bath tub in Australia
Only crocs I see are on this guys dogs...
Always listen and watch the locals 🇦🇺
That's a Darwin Award qualifying activity.
LET the crocks have a free lunch...ignorant idiot!!!!
“You’re in Australia!! Everything is 100% poisonous!!!☠️ “😏🥴
I don't know how he got that old and is so unaware...
Thinning of the herd…. Let him be, “It’s natures way…”
🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
So did he survive
gotta be a' merican
Dude!!! when an Australian tells you there's an  animal near by that can hurt you... you better run!!! Australians aren't scared of nothing man.... they're like American women.. they'll take anything and try to turn it into a pet!!😅
This smurf is definition of Stupidity,  that too with Ego
As an American who read that there are myriad Aussie animals who can easily unalive me, I'd listen.
He has every right to get eaten by a crocodile
I grew up swimming in the river swamps in south Mississippi and i would never get into any body of water in Australia!
That teletubbie wants to be a crocs or sharks snack
Tinky Winky I presume? What is a Teletubby doing in North Queensland?
Buys an Antarctic Wet Suit in SNOW COUNTRYSIDE AND THINKS HES STEVE😢 RIP
We need more smart people like you in the world 😂
Typical you tell people something out of the goodness of your heart because you are concerned for them, they proceed berate and belittle you etc 😂 oh well can tell why he is in the water with the brain that is attached to that mouth
Darwin would be proud of whats about to happen
😂
That smurf is really an idiot, he deserves an Darwin Award.
Just let him find out the hard way. What a idiot..
"Where's the sign" yeah bud because crocodiles totally only go where there is a sign....they're just respectful creatures like that.
When you get done by it 😮
Y say anything that's how we get rid of the idiots in the world
Smurf a la Bleu Croquette. Scrumptious. 🤗
The guy is an idiot. He sounds like a know it all 12 tr old trapped in a grown mans body. Bet he was eaten.
I like to imagine this is two YouTube short makers that finally met each other. We got camera man trying to save the day, and stuff for brains doing a vid on why Crocs aren't actually that dangerous
If an Aussie is shouting a warning at you ya should really listen and take it seriously without protest.
Why you even try to safe him?
At least he's got his sun protection on
F**kin Queenslanders. Always policing each other. If he wants to get eaten, leave him be and mind your own business.
If he wants to be eaten by crocs let him be, bloke's probably have a death wish.
That's like coming to Florida and act like there are no alligators or sharks or jellyfish 😂😅😮
I can tell you really quickly how to if a crocodile is in the water. Put your hand in the water and if it feels wet then there are crocs
Let nature run its course
He is about to visit Darwin
This "tourist" seems indignant when being warned of the crocs when he should be grateful!  Unbelievable!
As Aussies, we know danger when we see it and will ALWAYS tell you how it is!! 😊😂😂
He said he was aware, leave him alone. Stop being a bully
"Yeah righto"
Darwinism at its finest. He was warned. Your duty of care is done. If he’s intent on being croc food, who are you to get in his way! 🤪🤓
If an australian guy won't do it, don't do it.
People need to mind their own buisness
WHY ARE YOU STOPPING THE CROC FROM HAVING IT’S MEAL? CRUEL😬
Is he a migrant?
😂😂😂 Idiots you gotta love em!!! They make good content!!
Every lion, tiger, and great bear enclosure should have an attendant with an Aussie accent nearby.
And then they start killing the animal’s, if they get hurt by the animals.
He must be from the city of Darwin considering that he's about to win the Darwin Award.
I can tell you that no Barbadian is even going near that water knowing that crocs swims there 😊
Ha he must be on the dumb c$%t paddling team that guy.
Let Darwinism take its course here, I say. He wants to be an idiot, let em be and come back in a few hours. He'll probably be taken care of by then.
Darwin’s Law let them go bro
"Where's the sign?" Really? Idiot thinks that crocs only hang around where the signs are. He's gunna be REALLY upset at the croc eating him without a sign to tell him there's crocs around. This is just proof that idiots will always idiot.
Let nature take its course.
Swimming in Australian waters .  Is psychotic !
Was anyone else waiting to see a croc come up next to him? I sure was.
Was this guy eventually eaten ? That my question 😅
Will there be a Part 2?
FAFO!
Live and learn, buddy......... oh, no, rather I should say "die and discover"....
we are the only ones that have genuinely affected the process of natural selection, the only ones in the universe....
What a dumb@ss. He must be from NSW. I'm from south east as well but even i know not to swim up north. Smh.
Sometimes people need to mind their own bidness and let Darwin figure it out 😂
Would have been better if the woman was a Floridian. When you got an Aussie and a Florida resident telling you to back off of a dangerous situation, your in deep sh*t.
When a guy that sounds like the Crocodile Hunter says its dangerous... 😱
Do crocs swim in water where you need a full suit and a hood?
They’re crocblocking
He’ll be alright. He’s dressed like a penguin. No penguin has ever been eaten by a croc ever.
Did he die
Big, blue dild0 going to feed the Crocs...smh
If you have to argue with them about their own safety then leave it alone
The cameraman's even wearing crocs
I’ve seen grizzly man but a croc man is real wild
Yet, he Obviously Was Not "Going To Got Done Y" 🐑👨🏼‍🔬👨🏼‍🎓🦛🦛🦛🦛🦛🦛🦛🦛
I never ignore strangers who are trying to give me life-saving advice
Darwin Award 🏆
How has that man made it to his age?
If you don’t know how to hold a f**king camera, don’t!!!!
Dressed like a Smurf in 40 degree heat what do you expect? Mans on a mission to commit suicide leave him alone
Usual suspects
I think if an Australian is CONCERNED about being in a place with an animal... It MIGHT just be of concern.
An Australian wearing crocs, yelling about crocs… what a flex 💪
He looks like a snack.
Does no one else see the irony that he is warning a bloke about crocs, while wearing crocs?
What a horrible way to wanna die.
"Don't blame the croc when you get done by it". 😂 I love local slang i never heard before
Yes he wants to be eaten by a crocodile
"You do your thing and I'll do my thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,...... for about another 6 minutes. ".......
mate, ya facked, mate!
I woulda just said “G’day mate!” And laughed at him
another strong contestor for darwin awards
Sign or not, I’m not getting in any body of water in the Northern Territory. Even if people say “They don’t come this far South”, I still just don’t care. I’ve read enough about crocs migrating south due to rising temperatures and over population and heard enough stories of people getting taken in an area they thought there were no crocs..
Let him go...its called natural selection...we need a smarter society.
Wheres the sign😂 lawdy. I remember in the 80s there was a run on tourists taken by crocs, one occasion the sheila was asleep beside the sign by the billabong saying about danger of crocs.
How can he bame the croc if he got done by it?
Some people want to fight crocs. Let them.
Wow
😮 I'm agraid of the alligators in Florida!
Shout-out to the locals for schooling him.
And he has crocs on his feet 😂 the irony
Joe biden?
At least the stingers won't get him...
I love cairns best Place in qld
Nothing scares Blue Man and his faithful rectangle board...
Darwin Awards for the teletubby...
Idiots lol
North Question is Wild…
90% chance he died if he went out there in the open
Did he get eaten??? Update?
Mmm lunch
If a someone from QLD calls you crazy than you know you messed up astronomically
He is likely to be removed from the gene pool....so it's a win for the human race (provided he hasn't already spread those idiotic genes).
Crazy people don't know they are crazy
That's was almost a good video
Don‘t blame the crocodile🙏😂
Yes but just tell him nicely? Then you won’t get a fight.
Why is it always a white person? Just saying
The moment I'm told this is the moment I'm rushing to get out.
When he asked where is the sign after being told to use common sense, tells me he is from victoria, this is QLD we have big mud gecko's up here 👍
Bro is hand peddling
Darwin award winner
If an Australian is scared you should be absolutely petrified and unnerved
dude thats scary to think he was just ok doing that to himself
This was fascinating...
I think he was South African , did anyone else hear that accent . .? 🇦🇺🦘 He probably thinks he knows it all as they have some big carnivores over there ?? Just my opinion but our Sally’s are cleve pr cunning and quiet .
I can't believe that this clown. He sounds like an aussie aswell which makes him look even more of a D!ck head.
Common sense isn't that common.
“I’ve never won anything in my life but I bet I can win a Darwin award!”
You should be worried for sure more dangerous then other countries.
All that splashing he’s doing with his hands as well a croc will hear that and go right too it
Don't mess with a Queenslander
Common sense 😂😂 That is the rare animal here
Man, I moved from North Queensland thinking I got away from all of the crocs, and now there have been sightings in this town🥲🤦‍♀️
Dinns dinns 🐊🐊
Natural Selection in action
Darwin Award finalist
Old bloke thinks he's Crocodile Dundee or Steve Irwin 🐊
Australia is home to some of the most dangerous animals in the world, including spiders the size of your fist, mammals that will happily bludgeon you to death for fun, and enough poisonous snakes to fill the state of ohio. Australians have never once batted an eye to any of it. So if one of them tells you its a bad idea you probably have less than 5 minutes to live.
Corcodile are nothing to this brave man
If a dude wearing Crocs tells you to watch out for crocodiles, listen to him.
Watch out for crocs. From a guy wearing crocs......
Stop trying to thwart natural selection.
Karens not realising they are karens no need to yell at the guy
you wouldn't believe it but he made it ashore safely only to get bitten by a taipan n die
at least his wearing his stinger suit n the box jellyfish won't sting him to death😅😂😅
UNBELIEVABLE (unless he was carrying out his death wish)
Then the poor crock gets killed. 😢  idiots like this
Unreal
One of those I know everything idiots
Such a nanny state
Is he referring to the crocs on his feet?
Man, I loved the guy saying “don’t blame the crocodile when you get done in by it” cause you wanna paddle board in Salt Water Crocodile infested waters 🙄
🐊: " leave him alone.. he's our friend.. do your thing let him do his.. 😋"
The dude paddle boarding is Australian as well, just goes to show not everyone is made equal, there's morons everywhere. If ppl don't grow up around deadly wildlife then they don't comprehend the danger. You would think just growing up in Australia would cure idiots like this, atleast it's going to remove him from the gene pool.
Stop interfering with natural selection
I wouldn’t eat anything dressed like that if I were a croc tho
Crocs hate blue, he's safe (grin)
Sometimes people throw fish guts in the water at boat ramps the Crocs wait around for it. So far as Northern Australia goes read all signs, ask a local or just safely assume that all water contains Crocodiles or other things you dont wanna get acquainted with (even check the swimming pool prior to entering).
I lived in Cairns never get into the salt water unless you're an idot
Dudes way overreacting. Go virtue signal somewhere else and let guy do his thing in peace.
The dude warning him is wearing crocks for fucs sake LOL.
Let's see, I better protect my delicate skin from the sun and water with my fancy dress smurf outfit .  Do crocks eat smurfs? That's merely a sign and a couple of Skippy dudes that clearly don't understand that I can read , I just lack comprehension and I'm a scientist at heart and I'm testing my new swim outfit against a 20foot crock. Am I right or am I right or am I woke or am I in f#$%@&^ danger. Haha what an idiot, does he know attempted suicide is illegal in this country.
... the blue onesie man was never seen again.
Smurf in real life be like ....
This dude is dead now, yea?
At least he won’t get stung by a jellyfish wearing his stinger suit…
You can't fix stupidity, let nature teach him a lesson. Survival of the fittest.
Natural  selection....it's science!
Why do you need a sign? Just have common sense ffs
Absolutely right, if you won’t jump the croc fence at the zoo and go for a swim In his pond, don’t do the exact same thing out in natural croc habitat. Not the animals fault that people act like the easiest possible prey.
No It's a  "Fk$n Crocodile 🐊 recently seen sign " 😂😂 💀☠️
He wanted to check out. He was ready to get off this planet.
They won't bother you if you don't bother them😂
The instant he said "You do your thing and let me do mine" I would have said "Okay sir, have a nice day." and let him get eaten.
You can't fix dinner
Right, dont blame the croc.
What is that fruity lil guy even doing? Typical “athletic” nerd type with zero common sense that thinks they are smarter then everyone else
Nothing wrong with natural selection people. Let him go.
“Do my thing” … “Don’t blame the Crocodile”… edit this to say Alligator and I would have guessed this was Florida🐊
Seriously! They hang out by docks....lady went to another woman's home to do her nails and was told NOT to wade in the water by the dock. She was attacked and it spun and maneuverd her underwater. She died. Very foolish!
Must be an American Trump voter! They would make even a Crocodile sick!
Title should be Aboriginal vs Labor voter.
Hey make darwinism* great again
Croc has McRibs on the menu.
It's just like when people get mad when they get told about how their sins will lead to death and Jesus is the only way...
I live in Florida, I've chased 5 foot gators out of my yard but there is no amount of money you could pay me to go into water with crocodiles. 😕 They are next level mean.
Ah my home town. I grew up in cairns. Gorgeous place filled with arrogant (not all) tourists. I remember the conversation i had explaining that no its NOT an alligator, it is a salt water crocodile and very aggressive. Bless their hearts they told me i was wrong 🤣. I tried 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Literally Americans RN; ya’ll voted for a fascist dictator again.
Let them go and find out for themselves
He's literally paddling with his hands too he's not even using an oar 😅
😬 lived there for a few months, was incredible, but I would never!
Doesn’t surprise me. Every population has a few. When you go to Yellowstone or other parks, some people will get out of their cars and approach elk or bison or bears, which is of course a terrible and dangerous idea. I would hope most people would be aware how dangerous saltwater crocodiles are, but somebody is always going to be oblivious.
He's eager to win his Darwin award
If I were that guy in the water I would be shaking and paralyzed once they started talking. Especially once I heard that lady and how concerned she was as well. They’re literally probably right…beneath…you….
3xsigns man. Faaaaaa
😂😂😂😂
For us in Oregon, its the same with drowning. You cant always go in the water here bcuz their is wood and debris coming off the mountain thru Spring. Every year thou. Smh. Darwin I guess.
Well I guess you’re gonna have to wake the gimp up .
My guy said CROCODILE, not alligator.   That’s a five foot difference there buddy.
Just wow. Narcissist's grandiosity makes them believe they're unassailable😢
He’s giving: “LET ME GET EATEN IN PEACE!”
What a dum tourist
I hate going in any “wild” water but I wouldn’t even get near the shore in Queensland.
if he survives he'll be on twitter complaining about crocophobia
"That's not a knife."
The definition of a male Karen 👆
He was obviously under the impression that crocodiles are unable to see the color blue
Good luck getting home. Crocs aren't like alligators. Even in southern asia people don't do this in dangerous waters
Darwin Award Winner  🥇
The croc is mouthing to the blue man "Don't listen to the crazy Ozzie" whilst rolling its eyes and making crazy signs at the side of its head and giving him its very best smile!
He was clearly suicidal.
Listen to the locals wherever you go, they know their surroundings better than you.
great view of the pier
He should be thanking the Aussie man for his genuine concern.
Look what he’s wearing. That should explain everything
Future Darwin Award winner, there.
He is as dense those, who swim at beaches frequented by sharks where, no swimming signs are plastered everywhere.
Let the crocodiles enjoy their meal in peace
Bro is a snack and he’s out there on a silver platter 🤣
The guy is right.  Don't blame the Crocs if you get attacked
Natural selection at work
Idiots everywhere 😂 These signs are there for a reason!
Sometimes dumbs just gotta go
To everyone saying when an aussie says to get out, you get out. Well that's an aussie in the water so obviously ones more aussie than the other one.
Aussies know when you go north there a point where you stop being able to go swimming unless it’s in a pool.
Aussie is screaming at your recklessness => Pride in pocket and out of hazard you go
Giving a lecture on crocs while wearing crocs😂
I was walking on shark bay beach in oz and an english person came up to me with a surfboard and asked if it was ok to swim/ surf there . I mentioned that I too was english and not a local but since it was called Shark bay i couldnt honestly recommend it . They still got in 😂😂
Perhaps he's wanting to become crocodile turds.
If he wasn't doing that he would be on a bicycle in lycra antagonising car drivers
Crocs love the boat ramp. They hang around waiting for smurfs that surfs.
Natural selection mate.
Common sense isn't very common 😂
I SO wish there was a PART TWO!  I’m TOTALLY TEAM CROCODILE…. TEAM BLUE POWER RANGER on a PIECE OF POLYSTYRENE?……. Anyone??
Man’s gotta paddle, croc’s gotta eat!
Yep. This is not uncommon. I once came across some German backpackers having a morning bath at one of the boat ramps on the Bloomfield River.
Why is he dressed like a teletubby?
Natural selection
Darwin got one thing right but that's about it
What a d@ckhead 😮 Here's a tip - when you're in Australia you should always listen to the locals 🙌🏼🦘🦘🦘
That's a retired super Lib from SoCal. They will argue with your entire country as they are being death rolled.
Let that man enjoy his last mins he planned for himself on this cold cruel earth. He wants to be with the Lort
Must be an American
That’s why house prices are cheap in Cairns you can’t swim there unless you go to green island
Dont disrespect our crocies for eatin ya mate, shut up, let the guy do what he wants.
Struth 🙄🤣🤣
This is one of those examples where onen human just can't stand being told what to do by another..even if it kills him...idiot
Crocodiles 🐊 are really dangerous, basically I seen videos of them on internet 🛜 Luckily where I live there are no crocodiles, but if I did go to country such as Australia 🇦🇺I would not enter the same water as them for sure 👍
A lot of people would benefit from common sense! 🇦🇺
Warning him bout crocs while wearing crocs just pure comedy😂😂😂😂
Actively trying to win the Darwin award!! Let him be folks, let him be.
The beginning is the best. "You are in North Queensland mate, have some common sense."
North QLD is Australia's Florida....i would be more afraid of the smurth on the  board than the croc!
Just splashing around crock infested water like a fooking NPC
W ⚓
Let Darwin run its course mate
He is probably a vegan activist 😅
I was trying to listen to see if he had a foreign accent, and I was right. Sounds like he comes from Tasmania  😅
He’s Australian, I’d take his word for it.
Maybe he wanted to harm himself?
Nice concrete
The Darwin awards now filmed
When an Australian tells you you're in danger you better listen.
He's the food source..... what can you do.
We should let natural selection take is course more often...
Only a "Tourist" would ignore the Warning Signs. As locals are already aware of the dangers in the area exist. ❤
Atleast the crocodile is native unlike these Europeans
He's  Crazy  leave him
As a American being in any body of water in Australia other than a dam bathtub your insane!! 😂😂
You have to fight For the right To get eaten by a croc
Yeah after Covid Australians lost the right to tell me to do anything LOL
He's even dressed up like a candy in wrapper - lovely treat  there for the crocs
Another Darwin Award winner.
Foxy here.. hes a ole fool  fs  😮
nah let the boomers do what they want, they know everything dont they?
He failed the IQ test for sure!
The local didn't have to warn him but . He didn't listen what a prat
For only  idiot's 😂😂😂😂😂😂thumbs 👍
Fhim, let him get trashed.  Oh well.
🥱
If we never messed with natural selection, this conversation would never have taken place.
Who tf would wanna swim taking the chance there is a 20 foot long salt water croc somewhere. That is like volunteering to go to jurassic park.
I saw an article that he was eaten by a croc 🐊 yesterday 😢
Did he make it to shore?   F
what an absolute psychopath… a saltie could be watching you for hours and you’d have no idea until the moment it strikes and then you’re done, never to be seen again. 🤦🏼‍♀️
How to find out if crocodiles are in the water anywhere in Australia? Just stick your finger in and if it's wet then there's a croc inside.
Do crocs eat Smurfs?
“Have some common sense” It’s amazing how many people don’t.
I would’ve been out of that water so fast.
Meh.. crocs are like big dogs just like sharks. They can be friendly and like to be petted.
Get a boat for Christ sake !!!!    Not some scrap piece of lumber.   😂
"Yeah righto"
I wanna see the rest of this and if dude changed up and listened?
Get on land buddy!
Even God wants to see the way this ends. 😂
As the lady on the internet once said “Do you know how to tell if there is an alligator or crocodile in the water? Well I will tell you. It’s wet. Yep that’s right. If it’s wet good chance there is something in there that will eat you.”
Dumb bass -the B.
What is this board?!?😂😂😂
Do not interfere with nature.... crocs got to eat too...
He's a an idiot 👍👍
Diabolical of him not hanging around to record what happened next with paddle boy
The blue bodysuit says it all
Out of towner no doubt 🙄
Lived in North Queensland for years, used to canoe past crocs pretty regularly... Their everywhere, but most are surprisingly chilled. Enjoy your paddle mate 🫡😅
Nateral selection
Hhahahahaha love this
And unfortunately the croc pays the price for these idiots decisions.
Look what he is wearing ,tells the story
Common Sense, an oxymoron.   Salties give no mercy.   When this Australian is warning you about crocs, best pay attention.  N Queensland is gorgeous!
As a civilized European I know why we sent our Darwin award candidates "down there".
Maybe last time this Tele tubby was seen
"Let me do my thing!"  Croc- "Yeah!  Lay off the bloke!"
oh look, another case of D.F.I. (Dumb F**k Itis) XD
Aussies have more common senses than others
Any follow up ? 😊
Some people are just dumb and are looking to be eaten 😂
I have no plans to ever go to Australia but even I know that you don’t get in the water in Queensland. Good grief 🐊
My hubs was traveling through upper Canada at night, when he came across a dead dog in the road and another barking furiously near it.  He got out of the car, looked at the dead dog, which he couldn't believe just got hit because it was shredded. He tried to call the other one to get it into the car, it was frantic.  Luckily someone slowed down and told him to get back into his car, a grizzly certainly had killed the dog and would be back.  He got back in.
Get some popcorn 🍿😅😅😅
he started at Calais and headed for the UK!.
At least that stinger suit will help  protect him from jellyfish as the croc rushes him to the depths at great speed
Nah mate, leave him be.. he won't be there for long... 🐊
Oh, okay I heard the accent, saw the water, assumed it would be sharks.
What an idiot
It was his fault!..... Who?  The crocodile he started it
The chances of this board rider getting done by a shark is probably 1 in a million   The chance of this dude getting done by a Saltie is probably a million to 1 😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Crocs don't eat blue food, right?
I heard that dude’s name was Ketchup
This guys other hobby is/was Cyclist
Blue man group really struggling to find an audience these days I guess.
Auditions now open for the next blue wiggle
When dumb is a person 😂
Cross don't bother I swim all the time, great whites also
Fkwit
Natural selection
The crocs are like “hey be cool mate”
there’s a video of some guy doing this in a different country and he didn’t get to finish his swim
keep doing what you’re doing m8 and keep doing what you where gonna do!! i’m just saying don’t do what you won’t do
Would rather risk getting eaten by a crocodile than admit he was wrong
Lamo camera work. Nice sidewalk! 🤣
A special kind of dipstick 😮
Yeah Righto 🤪🤪❤️👌❤️🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈
Darwin Award candidate 2025.
When Joker said an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, i thought he was talking about a Florida Man meeting an Australian Goi.
Natures way of culling the herd...
"But I ain't spending any time on it, because every three months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland" 😂 iykyk
This situation is called "natural selection". The weak and dumb are weeded out of the gene pool of humans. BTW He looks like a croc blueberry popsicle.
People do need to mind their business
En plus je sais que tout les crocodiles sont dangereux mais en Australie ils ont des crocodiles marins ,ils faut être vraiment stupide pour ne pas tenir compte de quelqu’un qui prend la peine de t’avertir .Surtout que cela devait être écrit un peu partout .Ils ne faut pas s’imaginer que tout les gens sont intelligents
Stinger suit ain't gonna save ya. 🎉😂
*tick tock the croc has entered the chat*
Theres morons everywhere.
I think he is a tourist
In aussie in crocs talking about crocs😅 i love this world
"where's the sign" my dude there will not always be a sign
Another contender for The Darwin Awards
That poor Teletubby is going to get eaten by a croc.
I wonder if he ever met a croc on his adventures.
Is that one of the blue man group
Most Australian argument I’ve heard online in a bit
Step right up and be the next in line to get on Darwin's list!
When someone tells you to do whatever you want and silently watches you, thats the moment when the true horror begins
Darwin Award right there 🤦🏻‍♂️
That must be an American Democrat Voter! They’ll fight for the right for the Crocs to eat them! Then on the way down the Crocs Throat, they’ll blame Donald Trump!
Natural selection, feel for the crocs though when they get hunted or killed classed as a threat because of idiots like him getting attacked
🐊: “bro mind ur own business and just let him swim”
Did the crocs get him 😬
North Queensland occupied territory!!
He Must be a NZ labour party voter ..
Don't worry about it, he's trying to become dinner.
Where's the sign? 😂😂 Jeff Fox worthy - Here's your sign. 😂😂
Leave him alone.. everyone wants to carry on with a camera in their hands, aye..
When an Australian meets a Florida man
He wants to feed the Crocks.
Got a long walk home in a wetty mate or quick croc powered washing machine…. The choice is yours.
Water in Australia 🇦🇺 Could have a 🐊. U Don't see them for a Reason they've survived how Long.   A Steve Irwin Moment... smh ✌
Let him be. He can win his Darwin Award.
What an idiot
Murky water will get you merked mate!
Darwen Awards Winner!
why blur?
This idiot is the reason why I never give anyone advice ever.
Where is this
Enjoy the teeth mate
Common sense aint too common these days
I dont even get close to the beautifull water here in Darwin just in case, let alone do what he is doing. He got some guts to do that though....and I bet crocodiles love guts.
Seriously, f#€%!$g tourists 😂😂😂
just let nature do her thing
"Crocodile infested water" You mean their habitat?
vaccinated, boosted and believes fluoride is part of the food pyramid
Why don’t people accept their own fuckups with just a little grace?
Sometimes I think it may be better to let Darwin do his work..
30 fatal alligator attacks in the US over the last 25 years. Same number as fatal croc attacks in Australia.
If you;ve ever been to Australia, you'd hate the Australians as much as the crocodiles do.
Well if you take away the signs, the dummies will get rid of themselves. You'll spend less time explaining things.
He's Blue Man Food.
Don't try to reason with morons. Just let what happens, happen.
Let him go, but don’t go help him when he’s attacked . He doesn’t deserve it
White man activities 😂
😂😂
Good cricket all round 👏👏👏
This is called natural selection
There’s Americans, There’s Australians, and….. this guy.
Oh great look the indians have now invaded Australia too
I think this might be nature sorting out the geme pool.  Australians donjoke but this man is not joking.  Love the 'dont blame me if yoeaten by a crocodile'.   I have to this to American toirists that Australians are (well used to be when most were like this guy.. now there's a much greater diversity of folk here ) very different from Americans.   They never oversatate anything so if the sign says there's crocodiles  there are crocodiles.
Difference between a shark and a croc: the shark isn't actively trying to hunt you.
Get outta the water!!!! People get taken all the time up north. I went to adelaide river near darwin and saw the biggest croc there. I thought it was part of the river bank. It was about 6m long and over 2.5ft high. The whole river was full of them. You would not last 10s in the water.
Natural selection
I understand this guys just trying to offer life saving advice...but for the future sake of our species, based on his response, maybe just let darwin figure this one out?
The fact he is issuing this warning whilst wearing Crocs is funny.
Where's the sign?  "ONE THERE, ONE THERE AND ONE OVER THERE!"  🤣🤣🤣 I love it mate .  Let the man swim🤣🤣🤣
NO WAY! I hope he made it. 🙄
i appreciate the fact someone tells him and the says "dont blame the croc" because thats literally how everyone should understand doing anything in areas where wildlife are more common.
this rule applies to florida too. be hyper aware at boat ramps!
That’s a blueberry human dessert for a very lucky water lizard…
I get wanting to help a guy out...but why record it? (Yeah, I viewed it but I thought there was something more to the video than just this)
All these comments about rugged Aussies is passe. They have become as nanny-state as the English
C’mon let nature take its course.
Darwinism at its finest
Yo if an Australian isn’t doing it when it comes to doing something in the wild… then don’t do it
I’ve swam with sharks, and for some reason if I saw “crocodile recent sightings” sign I’d be shaking.
Warning comes before destruction. God literally sent a man with a boat and he still rejected the rescue.
*territory
Its their terrestrial
That potentially could have been an epic video
Natural selection at it's best, id have warned him once, then left him.
He must be insane to be in that water, knowing there’s crocodiles and a crocodile was swallowed that little bitty boat thing he was on in him hole
Croc whisperer just doesn't give a , , , , 😂😂😂
Inclusiveness can’t work.  There are complete idiots in this world . They just can’t be. Let him swim!!
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it😂
warning about crocs while wearing them is priceless
What an idiot 😮
This idiot is akso insane 😂😂😂😂
Listen, I’ve been around and seen many countries and awesome sights…. I’ve never seen an Australian warn another Australian that something is too dangerous.
geez, i got PADI certified there.  Was i in danger that entire time?
Darwinism will take care of this fool.
As comedian Ricky Gervais once said “We need to remove all warning signs at beaches, on bottles, everywhere… & just allow Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection do its thing.”
The blue skin suit and him paddling with his hands like that just makes this endlessly comical.  Even if he were doing this somewhere safe he would still look like an absolute deeeb, but the fact he's doing it in croc country ... I can't 😂
Another great example of F around and find out!
A picture of concrete nice job 👍
One thing i learned iin my travels. Listen  to the locals they are trying to keep you from getting hurt so listen   to them.
He should also wear his seat belt
Do what you wanna do..Don't go complaining when you're eaten..
Where's the sign?  Here's your sign 😂
Guys standing wearing crocs as he says all this I love Aussies 😂
Mmmm blue flavour, said the croc
Hahaha This is like when people come to Florida and we have to remind them we have alligators AND crocodiles and they STILL go in the water!   Them: YOLO! Me with popcorn: FAFO!
Will always remember this nice australian elder who made us, group if 4 young tourists out for surfing at tiger’s bay, go around and change spot because of bad currents that none of us could have ever seen and would have swept us away. Always listen to an australian telling you to be careful (applies even more to thai people 😂)
If i was a crocodile i'd leave him well alone. Something very strange about him.
What even is he doing? Looks like he's on a foil board. Wing foiling without the wing?
Must be a tourist.
Well he is suited up for stingers, so he is only 50% fkwitt😂
I woulda told him to go further out 😂
The signs are to protect the crocks, because Adam Briton is in da house! 🐊👀💭😍🫣😂😂😂😂
Honestly the biggest “tell” other than the signs is when you see beautiful water on a beautiful day and no one is swimming.
He will be fine. Crocs don’t eat Smurfs.
I thought all australia had crocs but I guess it’s only certain areas
😂 bon appetit
The crocs also hang around for the tourists
How ignorant and entitled do you have to be to be offended by someone wanting you not to be eaten by a river dragon
I jumped into the daintree river at the ferry spot. IM a Canadian and we stopped at the ferry. We just drove like 2 hours in the car with no AC.  I saw the water jumped in people were going nuts telling me to get out . I got out a park ranger scolded me and then I saw the no swimming siggn. WOOPS>  Coulda cost me my life but hey I have akool story to tell now.
Mate leave him alone he is a crocodile whisperer
Crocks love smurfs. Blue food is their favorite.
The ego of this fool is positively Darwinian.  I’d wager he’s never actually seen a big salty before and has no idea about just how much of an appetiser he looks like to a crocodile
The guy in the water sounds like a Auzzie aswell,...im from Melbourne so sometimes we just don't know 🤷🏻‍♀️.
Part 2??
I wonder what's for lunch.
Nature will take it’s course
Stupidity personified. 🤔
Let him go 😅 😂😅😂
"where's the sign?" BY THE CROC!!!
What a fool maybe this is what he wants this is his way to go well bye sorry you chose a messed up way as it will be a mess lord go take some pills and go asleep sorry that's a death sentence ya may aswel like hypothetically speaking well texting 😂
DON'T BE A C**T MATE....🎩💯
you won't see the croc until it all over.
Chum
Sometimes you just gotta let idiots be idiots, in this situation it shouldn’t be long until he “learns”
let me guess that man was American?
Idiot
Dumb
"Where's the sign."   Reminds me of that lady who wrote her local paper about getting the "deer crossing" sign moved because the deer crossing there was too dangerous.
Dudes clueless!!
Darwin award... If he gets eaten he won't procreate his dumb genes
Wheres the sign 😂😂
Darwinism.
Smart fella
Teletubby goes knee boarding!
Or the australian guy can mind his own fcking business.
Darwin will win.
leave XQC alone
Natural selection. Let them be 🤷‍♀️
I woulda jus sat back and waited for a show honestly once in a lifetime thing to witness
Shhh just let natural selection happen
"Where's the sign?". I think you should worry more about the crocodile
This is why some countries need difficulty levels for tourists. For most of the world it'd be 1-5 stars. For Aussieland it just defaults to DOOM difficulty by region. Im too young to die to Ultra nightmare >_>
Let nature take it's course.
Am I the only one that thought his blue suit was to edit him to be a lion, or whatever else, on the board?
Is he an American? Because he sounds like one of ours😂😂😂 his common sense is on point.
Nice bodysuit.. 😅
Darwin
Nobody is telling the crocodile that they shouldn't be eating humans what a idiot
Natural selection
I recon this guy rides a push bike on the highway
Hes fully aware...wow..not brave just reckless.
I don't care who you are or how much you're offering me. If an Australian dude is telling me to leave because of a dangerous animal, I'm getting out of there so fast
Natural selection
What an idiot some people will just do whatever they want and think they are invincible.
Bro came to feed himself to crocodiles 😂
Love how it’s not even a real paddle board… it’s like a boogie board this guy is insane even the ozzy thinks so
I would ask him if it is ok if I video him feeding a croc.
Realize that he may likely have Alzheimer’s. The baby boomers were adventurous people and are getting taken out in droves by this neuro-degenerative menace.  Consider it a potential factor when dealing with anyone who seems confused or showing lack of judgment and is over 70.
It’s cool. He’s from Dade County. 😂
"you let me do my thing" no. this is not a "this is none of your business sitution" because once that croc kills you, it can no longer live there and the option is either it gets killed or taken into captivity. It's not fair on the croc.
Where there water there croc
I think i wanna start a argument with a Australian just so they can just talk to me like this because as a American a Australian person arguing is the most interesting entainment I've watched.
I love how the guys wearing crocs 😂
He’s arguing about it… 😵‍💫🤦🏻‍♂️
There’s a man with a death wish. You truly cannot cure stupidity!!
Do they hand out the Darwin award posthumously???
Yikessss
🐊 is patiently waiting for him to get near the dock to have a little Smurf N Turf!
Australian wearing crocs warning somebody about crocs.
When an Aussie telling you to have common sense you get off the water.  😂
His hotel is probably looking at the footage and has already started clearing out his room...
Dressed like a Smurf, if he gets severely bitten he will bleed out & look like a real Smurf if he's unlucky.  The Darwin award goes to...
He's been nominated for the Darwin Award.
Some people just need to be right in their own world then be wrong in the actual world. Fking arrogance
Silly that the man is paddling in crock waters and why is he wearing a wetsuit in balmy waters??
Must be Mega influenced cause that is crazy that hes getting angry cause he’s being told not swim in croc waters
A quick run down on our waters.  To the north there's crocs lots of them. Rivers, beaches.  The middle belt is bull shark territory. And further south is more white shark turf. You do not want to see any of them while you are in the water  with them.
Rule #1 when travelling Australia.  Always listen to the locals
Typical zoomer...you don't tell me what to do.....😅😅😅😅
and some crocs end up dead to get his body back
I miss far North Queensland so bad.
Crocs hang around, waiting for fish and tourists.
For those of you not from Australia…this is an entirely typical response from an old bloke on his own…you wont tell him ANYTHING 😂
Why are so many old Aussie men so feeble and ignorant
Idiot
Don't go ahead man
Natural selection at its finest
Take the signs down and let the morons go hard!
Dude’s trying to win the Darwin award and y’all are cockblocking.
You can’t educate/save a “know it all”.
Anyone know who this guy is or where he’s from?
Just leave this man alone it will never happen to him.
Are the darwin awards being held in darwin this year or closer to where the board was found smeared with blood?
Crocodiles in the rivers, sharks in the sea, snakes and spiders on the land. Is there anywhere safe that you  go in that country?
Looks like he got turned down at an audition for Blue Man Group and decided life was just no longer worth living.
The croc probably would have been killed anyway to retrieve the body. Probably all 3 if they didn’t know which one. I don’t understand why they do that, seems very unfair.
The crocodile saw him but was worried that if he ate him he might get infected with whatever brain damage disease this man has.
Hear That Accent?? Enough Said!!
LOL who TF goes to Australia and just randomly goes off into the water??? Crocs, jellyfish, bluering octopuses, snakes, bull sharks.
cairns is well known for alot of crocodiles living in the mangroves and go and clean their scales and to find food connecting to the ocean around cairns ., very dangerous and risky
Darwin Award Contender
If an Aussie says its bad.... its bad. The way he does not want to believe it eh 😂
I live in Qld, no sane person gets in the water in north qld.
What a goof
Let him go.  He can learn himself.
Aww funk that. I’d be crying and begging that man for help.
Darwin Award contender
Lack of logic…some ppl have no brain
Natural selection is what your witnessing 😊
You would think, as often as arrogant, ignorant people do themselves in, that the population overall would become more intelligent by natural selection. 🤔 Still waiting.
Senility
Darwin Award finalist. 😂
Stay out of the water. Wherever you are. You don’t belong there. Stop it.
Imagine getting defensive when someone is trying to save you from a gruesome agonising death.
Weirdest suicide ever.
I might be retiring in Australia, but they certainly do have a lot of dangerous wildlife
That murky water gives me chills not knowing what's underneath
A man warning about crocs while wearing crocs seems like an expert. 😂
That's one annoyed Brit. Natural selection should probably just take its place sometimes, even if croc assisted? 😅
jajaj the whole picture is funny! A crazy little blue smurf paddeling and the local guy telling him" Don't blame the croc after you are done with him!" 😂😂...
As long as we stop hurting the animals let these ppl do what they want....atleast the beautiful animals get something decent to eat 😊
What a drongo
I wanna know what happened next 😅
Floridian here.. All this is true!
Difference between Florida man and Aussie man - one smart enough not to go in
Fair, although common sense and North Queensland aren't necessarily well acquainted.
Yeah apparently they are waiting around for fish and silky people who don’t believe signs
I say, just let him.
If I was the cameraman I'd bring popcorn and sit there waiting
Why are you wasting your breath, they obviously seen the signs and ignored them. This is why we have crocs, they remove the people who don't have common sense.
Crocodile Dundee over here saving the day again
Darwinism at its finest.
this is exactly what bob kattar was worried about
Dude these people are trying to remove themselves from the gene pool
If I see  a sign or someone so much as mentions salties are nearby, I’m going somewhere else
Imagine getting angry at someone for wanting to swim wherever tf they like XD glad I ain't in Australia.
This conversation eerily resembles that between an evangelist and a person who says they don't believe in God. 😆
Tool
Now I wanna know how this ended....!! 🤔
People should stop using the word infested of animals living in their own natural habitat. It's we humans that are the spreaders of damage and disease.
Who wears a wetsuit in North Queensland???
Dude looks like a Reddit moderator that decided to go out and have an extreme day😂
Just let him be crocodile food crocodiles have to eat too
Is the Smurf from Florida?
Must be a tourist
"No worries" ... lol 😂
You won’t see the croc mate it will stalk you and you’ll never see it
Mr. Smurf isn't very bright.
I'm guessing hes a vegan cyclist on a body board
You know what's the best way of knowing if there is a crocodile in the water in Africa and Australia,  if you touch the water and it's wet that means it can likely have crocs
Shhhh...i wanna see....
When an Australian tells you something is safe, you give him a laughing dubious look.  When an Australian tells you something is dangerous.... you take him seriously.
"There is no such a thing as a saltwater croc..."  🐊 "How can I help you Sir?"
Naw, I just wouldn’t f@ck around w/ Australian crocs- period 💀💀💀 aka: Australian salt waters especially the infested ones
We see the same thing down in Florida, where New Yorkers move down there and throw a tennis ball into lakes for their dog to fetch, then wail like a stuck pig when their dog becomes an alligator’s lunch, and start demanding that the alligators be exterminated.  No, ma’am, you can just shush and learn from this.
Natural selection at that point.
What is he even wearing, and why is he KNEELING down
IDIOT!!!
Not too bright is he?
There are people who cannot be told. They believe it will never happen to them. Leave him to it.
If an aussie tells you to get out of the water, you should probably just go ahead and do that! 😂
If an Australian tells you there's dangerous animals around then you better believe them...
lncredibly uninformed person.
Future Darwin Award Winner!
Maybe the crocs recently seen were the ones on his feet
American Population control solution…?
Yeah, it's probably the same thing as going swimming in a fresh lake in Florida. 😬. Just don't do it mate, because there are alligators in there! 🐊.
Natural selection, leave him to it
This is how you get the life insurance company to pay your family when you want to off yourself
And he didn't get eaten
What a freaking idiot!
It's always a good idea to stay out of water that you see no one else in
When your pride is willing to allow your body to be swallowed by a crocodile in the name of not being "wrong " 😮
you know if an ozzie is afraid of someone elses life then you take it seriously😂
If you have to convince a man to save his own life, enjoy the show🎉
What is he even trying to achieve? looks ridiculous 😂
Can't believe there are ppl out there who are this ignorant 🤬🤬🤬
Dying to get that Darwin award!!
Dont feed the crocs...
Let the man win the Darwin award
I think 🤔 it’s a woman ?
Jimmy Grant
Any Aussie telling you not to do something is a sign that you have made a very bad decision.
Yoo guys, this comment section is gold 😂😂
Did he have a English accent? Or was he another Aussie? I can't place it.
First guy: Probably could have let the fella know he was in danger without first insulting his intelligence. Second guy: probably could have just used his common sense, and accepted he was in danger without arguing about it.
About to earn a Darwin award😂
Nurture vs nature. Save the nurturing and let nature take over.
The guy paddling is a pri*k
....they've heard there are also humans hanging out at the boat ramp.
Let the guy be. You warned him already. He doesn't care. Leave it. No need to pull out your phone and record your lecture for validation from the internet.
The IDIOT in the boat has got to be one of these woke morons
First would never catch me dead in the water but if i was and he says would be doing that theres crocodiles i would jesus lisard out of the water
Must be British or AMERICAN  .... Duh 😂
"I thought this was America!"
Worst camera work I've seen in about a year or more
Hey - the guy in the water has his stinger suit on - so he's safe!
I suppose, I dunno... but Aussie Crocs would eat a Smurf on a Smurfboard...
You can't do anything with someone like this.  Hes on a knee board, splashing in croc country!
I would be more afraid of a Rabid Kangaroo
Austrailia is full of Deadly bugs and animals
Natural selection!!!
I learnt that the hard way up in Cairns back in 2003
Ironically, dude is wearing crocs! 😂😂😂
What agent is that? Can anyone name it out? Sounds like a Melbourne accent to me. Anyway, just let him be. You tried.
Natural selection let him and the crocodiles do their things
I can already see a pair of crocs right in the video
I presumed it was common knowledge that crocs were to be avoided at all times always.
you dont even walk near the waters edge, crocs will hunt humans, they know where you are the minute you step off the plane
why help people that willingly choose such things?
Man wearing crocs warns of croc sightings 😂 [Absolute Gold]
If another human tried so passionately to warn me for my life I think I would absolutely listen bro paused and took time out of his day when he could’ve just said “not my problem” and walked on. People say “give me a sign” all the time, but the signs are this, and they get ignored
The guy is Aussie and saying have some sense 😂😂😂 I'd feel like the biggest idiot ever
“I have common sense” dressed as Smurf
Why do some keep interfering with natural selection? Stop trying to chase away the crocodile's meal.
It's no joke, the waters are infested with huge crocs
The guy in blue must be from Florida
Australians 🤝 Floridians Not swimming in water
Can you put some clothes on please. It's so unhygienic to be undressed around food
There is only one thing that Australians are scared of, and this guy is paddling around in their water.
Australia is like florida but with the volume up, if the water is wet theres soemthing trying to bite you in it
I couldn't agree more with the other people if I was sitting in my bathtub and an Australian told me to get out there was a crocodile I would
I spent six months in Australia over the summer of 2013/14. I went swimming zero times
Im from HI. This reminds me of the dumb tourists who touch the animals
Blue man is probably in a croc belly right now
FAFO lol
Post.the vid
In Australia the Aussies warn each other of Crocs.  In America everyone stands by with cell phones waiting for the dude to get attacked.
I say just let this play out.
Can't fix derp.
He's got a knife  ? Thats not a knife. Lol how we forget
What a muppet haha
He is TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.
The video would have been better if you stayed quiet.
you should start by telling him that there's crocodile there..not start by telling him he is in North Queensland,you are stating the obvious,thats why he's mad,you start it out wrong😂have some common sense mate😂😂
If an Aussie man is telling you something you're doing is dumb, i suggest you listen mate..
You "can" deal with sharks, but you can't deal with Saltys.
Darwin's so proud of you little paddle-boy
Imagine getting angry at someone who is trying to save your friggin life 😂. This is natural selection at its finest.
I would love to see you if i was a Croc
Once asked a guy in Florida if he’d seen any alligators in a lake, his answer was a big “NOPE but doesn’t mean they aren’t any in there”
Sitting on a paddle board surly can’t be more important than getting eaten by a crocodile 🤷‍♂️
RIP in the croc tummy
Quit interfering with natural selection 😂
In Australia, we refer to morons like him as "Fuckwits"
**I PERSONALLY,  WOULD "NOT" HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO IT!!  JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH THE SHOW!!  LOL!! LOL!!**
Stop bothering and just let natural selection do its job.
Wherever I am, if I hear an Aussie accent warning me... I'm listening 😅 I'm moving, getting up, going inside, whatever...
the crocs hang around the boat ramp waiting for human blueberries apparently.
lol have some common sense.  awesome hahaha.
Kroko waits for their lunch 😂😂
Australians are fearless to a fault. So if they tell you that it's dangerous to be doing what you do, you'll do well to listen. 😂😂😂
"Don"t blame the crocodile😂👍
There are Karens and Darrens in Australia, too???
GEHA O' DA WATA !!
"Wheres the sign"  HOW ABOUT EVERYONE YELLING AT YOU THAT CROCODILES IN THAT WATER.   Bill Engvall  "heres your sign"
People need to mind their own business, if the guy wants to be eaten by a crog then let him 🤣
Nah, let him collect his Darwin award.
As someone who comes from a country that has many dangerous animals too, i would trust the locals if i was the american guy
Wow. Another Darwin Award potential nominee!
Is that a Florida Man?
I’m just trying to figure out what that guy is actually doing. Looks pretty uncomfortable to sit on your knees and paddle with your hands like that….
Idiot in blue😂😂😂
Looks like he's on a hydrofoil.
Stubbornness IS a self correcting problem, sir.
Let it be , let it beee!
Are there no signs up??
clearly many of you have zero understanding of the downright otherworldly joys of kneeboarding
Go do what ya wanna do , love u Aussies
Natural selection will put a halt to this. And then crocs will be denied snacks…
Pride goeth before the fall.
There is no cure for Stupidity,if Brain's were Sh!£ this guy wouldn't have enough for a decent Sk;d Mark.. 😂😂...
Darwin! It's natural selection!
Ahhhhh, yes.... I'm glad I didn't miss the Darwin Awards!! This season is gonna be great!
You said the warning, he still wants to go out...  Let him FAFO naturally
Beast love beast
What you doing today mate ? " just go paddle boarding in north queensland " 😂😂😂
I see some crocs on the man’s feet already….(the man recording the video)
Spock:  "They are dying!"  Kirk:  "Let them die!"  In this case I agree with Kirk.  Just allow the idiot to delete himself from the gene-pool!
Why didn’t he just help him in the boat instead of being judgmental and mean?
You need to tell him that crocs love to eat idiots too.
Hey of An Australian is telling its dangerous, your life is on thin ice
send the poms back
Bro shut up and let him be if that’s what he wants
this was my fishing spot… soooo many 🐊
Guy with the camera should mind his business, sounds like a karen
The most American Australian.
Salt water crocs.  One of the animals Steve Irwin focused on saving from extinction.❤
Yeah the queens lands aren’t that sharp of tools in the shed. This one is pretty dull indeed.
Just film you viral content and let the crocs have their Christmas dinner mate 😂
Why are u messing with Darwin?  Now u go get some fresh food for 🐊.
"Let me just paddle out into the croc infested water and make my self as turtle shaped as possible..."
Some people have to learn the hard way that they aren't the smartest person alive. Learn how to listen and digest what others are saying.
I’m no croc expert, but if I’m told by anyone they can see a croc anywhere, I’d get out and thank them with no questions.. especially an Aussie lol
Ngl, I think the guy WANTS to get eaten by the Croc 😮 why else would be ACTIVELY trying to defy a man who is trying to stop him from being eaten by crocodiles 😂🤦‍♂️ definitely has a deathwish
A muppet dressed like a smurf😂
Natural selection
Is the guy in blue British?
if an aussy giving me advice on an animal im listening, these mfs are born into a living minefield then proceed to live there lol
See, this is our problem. We keep saving people like this and letting them reproduce. I mean i understand we should be nice to our fellow man, buuuut... maybe we let this one slide for a better future? 😅
So ungrateful 😂😂😂😂
Cairns... this is where Jake is from
This is why my wife always told me to refuse any job offer that require us to relocate to AUS. She said “Nope, I don’t want to live among the giant spiders, the snakes, the crocs, the lizards, the sharks, the aggressive kangaroos…!”
Did he win his deserved Darwin Award in the end?
Idiot! I swear. The guy told him this location has crocs. But I guess he wants to be ate. Then that croc will be killed for eating him. 🙄
Doesn't anybody realize he's trying to commit on unaliving  himself.
Natural selection  🤷🏾‍♀️
If an Australian thinks ur being reckless ur probably being INSANELY reckless😂. Those dudes risk their lives daily so I can’t imagine how much danger this guy truly was in if even THEY were shocked 😂😂😂
If he's relying on the signs that would suggest he thinks the crocodiles abide by the signs!
idiots are all over the world
but the smurf is an Australian too - lol
As someone who's got family in florida and familiar with both crocs and gators  Yeah idc how deep that water is if you say there's crocs I'm not gonna go into the water no thanks  Sharks are easy to deal with crocs are not.
He must be a liberal they absolutely zero common sense. 😂
He's an American?😂
You're in Australia "dangerous animal", nearly always means "deadly animal".  Crocodiles are twice the size of American alligators.
If your in nth Queensland you don't have any Fn common sense to start with
Just let him, its nature takings its course this geezer was ment to be crocky food.
Is it really common sense?
Or just move to Florida😅 We are used to people swimming with the gators, & crocodiles🤷
City ppl are worse than tourist. Like snobby poms.
*Australia’s a no for me due to wildlife. The Roid-Roos terrify me.*
Wow...I hope the person being advised survived to realise the decent advice given.
Cairns
🤦‍♀️ Some people really don’t grasp how dangerous wild animals can be. It’s simple… keep clear of any wild animal that can maul or eat you.
I've been to Australia 4 times, and the closest I've gotten to water was taking the ferry to the zoo.
Darwin awards
Natural selection at work.
You’ve been warned. At this point I am asking for some help
I’m an American and if I were in North Queensland, wherever that is, I’d be totally out of any common sense and would immediately clear the water with that “alrigoit m8”
Dumb Dumb Dumb.   Southpark needs to get hold of this brilliant bloak
He's got a death wish.  What a fool!
A 1% survival rate is all you have if a saltwater croc grabs you.
Lol. U lost your mind when Steve Irwin says run and u don’t.
What the ....??    Some kind of Darwin award taking place here. Literally and figuratively. A, "I'm not gonna listen to the locals about the dangers", gene, or something.
Cameraman needs common sense..hold the camera up so viewers can see the whole video
He needs to get OUT!!!!!!!!
Hey I respect Australians, if an Australian is telling me to get out of the water, I make like Jesus and get out of the water.
Population control. Suicide by crocodile.
Natural selection
Natural selection. Just let it be.
Proof people still care about others, I would have just let Natural Selection run it’s course
Why can't people read signs?
I heard North Queensland and i remembered thatone politician that went from talking wholesomely about gay marriage to getting viciously angry about crocodile attacks in North Queensland.
I really don't think he'll complain about the crocodile when it does him in.
That was Aussie for: “Ok, bro, you wanna argue? Cool, by all means, get eaten. Enjoy mate.”
Future Darwin Award winner
Here is your sign.
Should've let mother nature take its course
Guys a brain surgeon.  I remember watching a TV show, Bondi vet I think in Australia and he was driving on a road next to ocean.  Beautiful blue water and you could see close to shore a gigantic crocodile swimming close to shore.  Which is why there was zero people on the beach.  I had never seen a salt water croc before.
If an Northern Aussie (Queensland or Darwin) is telling you not to get in the water,  don't get in the water, we are infested with Salt water crocodiles, sharks, jelly fish, stone fish, sea worms etc. Not to mention the mosquitoes alone will drive a regular human close to insanity. Explains the surf costume.
Salties very dangerous, some people just will never get it, .
A future Darwin Award nominee or Awardee!
The Australian tried to save the Teletubby
Crocs be like look boys surf and smurfs on the menu !!!
When an Australian is saying its dangerous, take their advice. They live with everything dangerous and know when something is actually dangerous.
Is this a British guy arguing with a Australian?? Dudes you Deported  half your citizens to Deadly Australia. The one warning you is a descendent of a Darwin Surviver and your not it.
What a nuff nuff 😮😮
Let natural selection work, one less I.D.10-T to deal with
Yep little man in bule and might be red
There's too many warning signs in the world.
Let him be bro .. survival of the fittest in Australia
What an idiot... If somebody is telling me to get out of the water because there are crocodiles you better believe im gonna listen and get out ASAP
Is he Indian? Explains everything 😂
The crocodile saying come on Cletus lol 🤣🤣🤣
The "signs" are actual crocs
let em go natural selection lol
This is Mother Nature’s way of saying come to my arms my stubborn, beamish boy!! You have been away now rest……
At some point you have to let natural selection happen: we need to begin to help our species evolve……
He wants to see through a crocodiles eyes in his next life. 😢
i find it funny how the guy warning about crocs is wearing crocs
If i hear an Aussie saying its danger i am f*** out of that area without a second word
I'm a yank from the states, that is one idiotic smurffed muppet thats about to one day soon become croc chow 😒
Crocodile: "nom nom nom" Blue Teletubby: "There was no sign!" Crocodile: "Oh, I'm sorry. I must have wandered outside the signed area. Pardon me."
Just let natural selection do its work
It’s the same thing in Florida. We have alligators everywhere. And one small lake near Sarasota has dozens of BIG ones. There are signs up, saying no swimming because of the gators, but you’ll see people playing in the water with their kids right next to the signs. True story, I canoed there, and was terrified  that my teenager would flip the boat. 🛶 One family was at a lake at a Disney hotel and their small kid went down to the water and was grabbed by a gator & couldn’t be rescued. The parents sued Disney & I don’t know how many millions they got. But I hope Disney put warning signs up after that tragic event.
Look at Luigi- if it's not all yt guys- then help us fix it... that one wasn't supposed to live into old age & the crocodiles need food too
Oh come on, they just want to play!
Darwinism. Leave him alone. Gets rid of bad genetics.
Mind your own business Karen
Please don't interrupt natural selection
"Where's the sign" points out 4 different signs lol
Too bad it wasnt near darwin for this darwin award winnah!
Bro if I lived in Australia I wouldnt even swim in pools 🤣🤣 this guy is BUGGIN
Check his croqs😂
Don't blame the croc when you get done by it. 💯
Here's a hint, people are more likely to listen if you speak to them calmly and respectfully don' t come at them with an attitude. If you're being rude don't be surprised if someone snaps at you or ignores you. It annoys me how people are trying to justify rude behavior. With that said, if someone tells you that there's danger around then you really should listen.
That blue suit won't go too well with red splatters about to be all over it.
Leave me alone I'm filming a CGI sequence
It's the same in FL. People lining up to get bit by gators. 🫠
this is whats its like to try and reason with my Maga mother, don't dare question her orange cult leader or she throws a tantrum that would make a 2 year old jealous.
Guy on paddle should let ego go and listen to sound wisdom. But again, to each their own and hope the guy is safe ❤
Lol. Aussies afraid of crocs
If an Aussie is telling me something is dangerous, I’m listening. They don’t take spiders or snakes seriously
Some people don't like being told want to do. They will literally put their life on the line just to feel like they're right.
I would’ve just smiled an waved
stop distracting the man on his way to down under!!😂😂
Nah he's safe, the croc would be laughing at his wetsuit combo to get a good hold.
The comment section is gold 😂
Stop taking videos of dumb s*** like this please
The fact that the guy on the wakeboard also sounds Australian is hilarious to me. Apparently, some of them are crazier than the standard (I say that with all the love).
Natural selection
I would stop talking and start recording. You've warned him and just let mother nature do its thing.
Says the guy wearing Crocs !! lol
Zero survival instincts
Fkwit
Australia lost a war with the Emu. Now they're afraid of all animals! Meanwhile in America people are fighting crocs with their bare hands on golf courses. lol
absolutely most useless  video on the internet. try harder or please don’t bother
Duh!
Good on them. Giving fair warning. Not escalating. (Guy even caught himself.)
The guy has never seen crocodiles before and he wants to see them from a close distance
Shhh... just let nature take its course.
just mind your own business.
Tree hugging greeny idiot
I live in the United States and had an Australian roommate for two years; he was never wrong about bad ideas
This idiot was more worried about his bruised ego than getting eaten by a croc.
I lived in Australia from ages 4 to just about 7. At no point was i in any danger, you know why? I listened to the locals warnings.
Suicidal Smurf
Jeez mate, just let the man do as he pleases!   Sincerely, not the crocodiles
I'll of left when he answered back.
At that point, it wouldn’t be “redrum” if they topple the boat and let nature take its course.
Just let natural selection happen
Bro has -100 in survival skills
He wanted to be part of evolution and nature, or he just wanted to made evening news. Personally I wont stop any this sort idiocy doing any of those things, unless ofc these "genius" is also likely getting other ppl hurt.
where is THE sign. guy show 3 signs! get a life buddy, tourism is also learn the local way :)
Das ist doch son Johannes der grad work and travel macht und den armen locals aufs Schwein geht
Aussies are as deadly as the animals in Australia. They don't mess about the bush.
So the predominantly nocturnal animal is going for the surfer mid day?
I thought that was a crocodile keep out sign 😂
Natural Selection thwarted again. 😖
That outfit doesn't exactly suggest he understands where he is. 😄
Make me anxious, this idiot
Thank you for warning him, even though he's not listening..
Haha, paddleboarding in QLD?  Effffff that!
He looks like the type of dude to wear a blue wet suit, get on a little paddle board, and vote for Camala Hairlips!
That's the right attitude! " Nah you gi ahead man" he😂
WOW 😯😳
Crocodiles rock.
Yet another absolute imbecile! He’s been warned by someone who knows. He COULD be suicidal and this is his choice of departing!? 🐊
Donkey
Sounds like an American 😂
I might as well listen to radio cameraman
AVATAR way of the water isn't what i expected 😬😆
It’s called natural selection
Even if crocodile is full. Not hungry. It will store your body. To eat later 😮
Covered up in blue suit. Gloves. Boots. Protection from the harsh sun . but not worried about being croc lunch 😅
Should just let natural selection happen.
This guy, trying to keep Steve Erwin down... let him be..
Hoping to see 'natural selection' happen...
Had this conversation with tourists as a Floridian.
He's just trying to strengthen the gene pool.
When someone who lives out in the sticks is telling you not to swim somewhere its not because of some petty government rule or because you could get in trouble it's because theres actual danger
I think he caught the guy committing suicide by croc 🐊
I'm scared of crocodiles and they don't even live here
Crock food on plate !
Why would u help this guy survive? 😂😂
You don’t mess with things the locals don’t mess with 😂
I wouldn’t dream of getting in any body of water in the entire country of Australia
where is the sign? lol, sounds like he thinks he can sue, but he wont just get bitten, they take you under even if not hungry and keep you for later.. Also, why is he exactly doing? its not a padle board or a surf board and there is no waves, looks kinda like a board meat for towing behind boats?
"Meanwhile in Australia the land of Death"
Natural selection playing out in front of us. Let it be lads, let it be.
One thing i learned about Australia is this. Never go in the water or even near the water.
In the words of the great Jeff Foxworthy "Here's your sign". This is one of those survival of the fittest, do we really want him taking up oxygen I mean what's the adding to society beside comic relief
To the man giving the excellent information information on what’s in the water God bless you❤❤❤❤❤❤
He pulled out his phone to record just in case it happened during the chat.
Future Darwin Award
And bro is wearing a whole blue suit looking like a snack waiting.
😮
Those who dont deserve to be saved. Allways being catered to.
Lol
Natural selection at its finest haha
Aussies are the biggest 🐱
From Florida.  If you try to warn him and he tells you to mind your business just smile and let him do his thing 😊
Natural Selection?
The fact the Australian is talking fast....means DANGER , RIGHT NOW !  It's probably on his tail...  Usually it will be like, "Maaaattteeee, probaaaably should get ooooout of the water ....."
Natural Selection NEVER takes a day off. Choose wisely.  🫡
He’s the type of person who will try to prove a person wrong , even if it kills him.🤦‍♀️
Maybe a "Don't feed the Crocodiles" sign is needed. 😅
As a Floridian who has seen quite a few tourists ignore the literal "beware of gators" signs, rule of thumb is to not feed the wildlife whether by hand or by serving yourself up as a boogie board plated low intelligence appetizer
I've never heard of a crocodile eating a smurf, so he should be fine.
He won’t even get a chance to blame the crocodile!!
Is that crazy Steve?
He wears a blue dress, everybody knows crocodiles don't like blue food... 👍
Future Darwin winner
Crocodiles love me....I have one named Fido. I could swim in there !
Yeah, righto.. 😂
Sometimes you just let them go….. survival of the fittest
There’s three people you should most likely listen to when it comes to dangerous animals, Australians, Floridians, and people from Louisiana.
Hey let him be croc food smh
They should have just let him find out.
Darwin award for this twit
Must be an American vacationing in Aussie land. Typical dumbazz behavior we are known for. Wild Bison seem to be our main favorite to run up on and get tossed by.🙄😂
Lol 😂😂😂
Called thinning the herd.....
Love that voice in the distance chiming in. :-)
Crocs love eating Teletubbies
Good Samaritan: There are crocodile signs Man: *argue2 Good Samaritan: My bad. They were duck signs. Enjoy mate See you on the news
I dated a girl from Adelaide once and actually flew for 20 days to see her😂… Place had so many deadly critters I felt scetched out taking a bath in her bath tub much less dipping my toe in ANY body of water!
Darwin.
Did he exit the water?
Natural selection is a real thing!
People like that Smurf end up costing the tax payer money because they ignore the signs. Always respect the locals and learn from them
Croc swatting
If I ever visit Australia, I’ll never to swimming, I’ll stay in the city. I know there I can be killed by other Australian animals but not a crocodile.
Seems like a painful method for suicide.
Ok blue Tingle.
Don't be asking this guy for help then when you get bit.
Australians take longer to say "no" than any other people on earth. "Nerwoooo" 😂
I think he could out paddle a croc 😂
Typical Californian
If theres 1 thing Australians know well, its Australia.
Pride comes before the fall
Doesnt matter if theres a sign or not. Crocs dont care about a sign.
White folks bruh.
“Where’s the sign?!”  Bruh.. even if there weren’t any signs. This MAN WARNING YOU TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE is your “sign”!  Guys trying to help you, he’s not saying you’re in trouble. Well… not legally anyway..
Terrible cameraman
Yeah righto!!…
This is the nicest most wholesome argument I ever heard. Guys is legit just worried about you getting eaten.
Aussies are crazy, so if he is telling you to get out. You probably should get out. But this is one way to get rid of people that think they are invisible
What a complete idiot.  But i guess thats why most of the videos on the "tube" with croc "encounters " in the North are MOSTLY foreigners.
Let him be the croc food he is determined to be
Brother. I respect animals. I know what they can do. I grew up in West Virginia and we had cattle. I have hunted bears and I have nothing but respect for them. If you told me that I was in an area where this was dangerous because of crocodiles? The moment you said that I would be heading for the bank And out of the water.   A guy like that will get ate up after he’s been told and he has no one to blame but himself.
American on holiday 😂
Lets him do that is call natural selection
Impressed.
I hate YouTube shorts. Like why isn’t there a way for me to get rid of the search bubble or writing to read the captions??
Why is he angry at people helping him😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t care how pretty it is there you couldn’t pay me to get into the ocean or bodies of water in Australia… I’m trying to live a longer life lol
Proof there are idiots everywhere. This guy is even dumber than people in the US trying to pose for selfies with bison or elk, or rolling car windows down to feed a bear, etc.
and this is why i dont read signs.  someone always says something about what they read.
Call me naive, but I had no idea crocodiles hang out in the ocean. Being from the States, I'm so used to looking for alligators at the edge of retention ponds when I walk my dog. They are notorious for ambushing elderly women and their dogs. I never walk near the edge and always warn ppl, but for some reason they never listen and think they can out maneuver an alligator. I'm sure crocs have the same ambush abilities.
And the Darwin Award goes to....
I’m American and can’t help but read all these comments with an Australian accent now 😂
Common sense isn’t universal but survival of the fittest is. Let nature take care of this foolishness.
Fool 🙄
Stop trying to protect idiots from themselves, please.
Let the fool push up daisies. Sometimes the camera man needs to let nature take its course.
He's probably a vegan cyclist.
I swear commonsense has been bred out of the human race. We have a similar problem in Montana telling tourists to stay back from bears, bison, moose, and elk. These idiots walk right up to the wildlife to pet and take selfies. SMH
Darwin will sort them out...
Like he said just let the man do his thing.  I no longer have a desire to be captain save a ***. Saving people from their karma means you take it on. I’d just give him the info and let him own the consequences of his own decisions.
CrOcOdILe InFeStED WaTeRs 🥴
Be quiet, but keep filming.   It's gonna get good
Man, how visitors love to ignore the locals!
- I also don't understand why people want to swim freely among sharks. It's the animals' water, you're on their territory, overfishing by humans, pollution, noise and other things - what kills the animal life in the sea is already terrible enough in advance. It is the animals that are punished if 1 person is tasted 🐊🦈🐊
Crocs will usually avoid humans unless they are hungry.
Typical Biden-Harris voter on the board.
Even if i wasnt in australia, if a man with that accent told me to get out of the water, im getting out of the water. You know hes seen some things 😂
I love how he made his final point. Go ahead mate!  😂
You all did the right thing by warning him, but sometimes Darwin has to be allowed to work.
Was he trying to end himself cause.... ????
I would have said good luck mate after the first warning, people are ignorant
How else will gators and crocodile survive? Aren't tourists their main food source?
Meanwhile, in America's most recent election ......
did you see that outfit?... let him go
mans really posted a video of him being a Karen to some guy trying to swim. Shittok doing what it do.
Wow
We need more self responsibility again. The ppl forgot to think for themselves. That makes us weak.
😮😮😮😮😮😮 from Malaysia 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
But he is at least wearing his Box jellyfish proof suit. Lol😅😅
Folks are dumb where they come from
he obviously never seen a saltwater crocodile. because if he had, no way in the world he would do that.
Live Bait
If some know it all punk wants to _argue_ with you while you try to stop them from getting a Darwin Award?  Let them claim it!  The gene pool will thank you.
Stop helping idiots get good camera focus.😂
Blue Santa Claus is wild
Salt water crocs. Jezuz. As if the ocean wasn't scary enough.
He's tired of living.
If an Aussie tells me to be scared Im listening 😂
When the Australian says get out of the water just stay cause you're probably already dead
bro cant read
I honestly would of kept my mouth shut and just kept recording
unless there's a sign I am safe
Lol, worse is when an Aussie tells you it's all good. 2006, North Queensland, Aussie takes me to a local fresh water swim hole a few hundred metres inland. I ask about the crocs, she sais no worries the salties don't go in fresh water. 2024, I watch Youtube and find out they live in fresh water too. Fair play though, they did try to warn me about the giant killer birds (Cassowarries, I thought they were taking the mickey until I stumbled into one at the beach). Saw spiders and snakes too, the place is nuts!
Let the crocs have a liberal for lunch.
Typical 🙄
Good bye. 👋
This wouldn't have taken place near Darwin, by chance? lol
Just let this Smurf be
When "I'm never wrong" clashes with survival.
Did the crocs get him ? I want to blame the crocs , then I can hear more of this guy 😅😂
Dude, probably just rolled in from Florida thinking he’s got this😂
If an Aussie tells me I need to get TF outta the water, I’m getting TF out the water lol
you make me sick
People man, smh.  This is why the smart or wise ones don't bother anymore.
Darwin
Let Darwinism win
Just leave him...he is dumb and wants to be food
Wow!!!  Stooopid is and stoooopid does😮
Tourists and immigrants are insane for this they think we just do it because we dont want them around i work in the bush and cant tell you how many get bitten by stuff they couldve avoided if theyd listened
Let him explain his rights to the crocodiles and maybe he can convince them he didn't see the signs.
Just film it and this video would've been a deterrent for future idiots.
Didnt see 1 croc
😂
Australian’s will look at a spider eating a house cat and say “oh that’s a baby spider”. If they say something is dangerous, nope the F out of there…
Poor guys just trying to cool off.  Sadly he has no idea of the risk he's put himself in.  It's good you've tried to warn him.
By now it’s suicide and not accidental death any more. Let nature take it’s course.
No people really do it to themselves
Guessing a naive lib!
What a silly person
Natural selection. He diesnt belong here if that dim.
“Where’s the sign?” Lists three signs
Natural selection at work, people need to stop preventing this... Crocodiles need to eat too.
Man just leave natural selection raw
Don't come running to me for help if your legs get bitten off, m8!
I'd love to know. If he finally listened to them
Tubarão ainda vai... Dá para relevar, já que normalmente não nos veem como comida (só nos confundem com uma), agora crocodilo? Somos basicamente self-service... *insira emoji de tapa na cara aqui*
When an Aussie tells you to get out of the water, it basically means the dinner bells ringing, and you’re on the menu!
This should be a tiktok challenge!
If crocodile Dundee yells at ya you better listen 😂
When you tthink you're smart enough you dont have to listen to the locals
Crocs don't anything that is blue... it's a well known fact!
When Sassy the Sasquatch has something to say you better listen.
"Don't start running until the Aussies start running."   ~The Girl Guide motto~
Liberal Lenny wearing his blue suit😂😂
Can’t I Just Reenact My Titanic Door Scene In Pieces 🤣 Righto Jack Go About Your Day 🐊
This is a very accurate representation of how MAGA people are here.
On behalf of the crocs, kindly shut up! Thank you.
Where’s the sign?😂
Haha let him enjoy his time on the water
😂😅🤷🏼‍♀️
Blokes on his way too the Darwin  award ,   good luck champ
If you are in a body of water in Australia , there's probably something in the water that can eat you.
So annoying like bro just let a man do a little boarding and mine your business
"lemme do my thing..."  What is his thing? Smurficide by croc?
I appreciate telling him it’s his choice. We should all have the freedom to be complete morons if we want to.
There are creeks around my house. If the council puts up a sign of a croc sighting people rush to the water's edge to see the croc. You only get to see them when you are in their mouth. Humans are not intelligent.
Sounds like he is a South African!
And why is he video taping? Are people really this brain rotted?
Foreigners thought process: If there isn't a sign saying don't swim with the crocodiles, it's probably safe to swim with the crocodiles...  Question: When you're cooking over a hot stove, do you look around for a sign telling you not to touch the hot stove? Because all the places i've stayed, i don't think i've ever seen a sign warning me not to touch the hot stove. Just saying...
Two different kind of Aussies that show why they have survived for so long. One who follows the signs and one who will survive no matter the odds.
The fact hes on a boat the size of there mouth is the dumbest thing
This kind man just wants to go ahead and feed the crocs and you harass him
Darwin...has an award quota :-)
WhEreS tHe sIGn??? Right there and there and there
He was indeed eaten by the crocs
The same kind of fkkkwit that would clean fish at the boat ramp, throw the guts in the water and then wade in to put their boat on thrailer.
Australia is basically one of the most dangerous places on earth: Highest concentration of sharks, crocs, poison snakes, poison spiders, poison snails, etc ad nauseum.  If an Aussie says "Its too dangerous mate"  you best listen.
He wants to argue. OK. Go play in the traffic.
If a crocodile gets him, is there really a loss?
One of those super rich people who THOUGHT they were superior.
Let evolution run its course , he will not be missed by the human race.
"...have some common sense."  You lost him right there.
Natural selection in progress
He's gotta be a kackles follower. They don't listen to nobody except their fake news stations. (This is a joke for this video, but not a joke on my country.)
What an idiot
Imagine being on a paddle board and having a man in an Australian accent tell you the crocs are going to get you. That’s like something from a nightmare. How is that man shrugging it off😮
If folk don't adhere to warnings, then if they become chow for the crocs, then fk them, it's  their own fault!
He know Crocs, look at his feet ;)
I just warn them once and let nature take its course... We have an overabundance of idiots these days, we can afford to lose a few.
The guy paddling is also Australian weird that so many didn’t pick up on that
The dude in blue sounds British. No wonder.
He is not just risking his own life. Some hero out there may well try to help him if he gets attacked and the croc might get killed for just being a croc. At least by the end of it he sounded like he would get out.
The chap is a DONK. Serve them right if they were eaten having been given good advice by passer-by’s on risk from crocodiles.
Denial is great for natural selection
😂😂😂❤ yum yum
“let me do my thing” lol
Is it me... or is that a dumb Kiwi we got rid of. Not our proudest moment. When in Australia, do what the Aussies do and follow the rules.
NOT ACAB
NOT ACAB
This is called natural selection.
Common sense not so common after all.
“You’re gonna get mauled by a crocodile mate!” “How bout you mind your own business” Well this should be horrific to watch
Same advice in Florida. If there's water, there's a croc in it!
I'm deathly afraid of any crocodile / alligator species. This man is an absolute clown both literally and figuratively.
THAT GUY ONTHE  BOARD IS ARGUING  NOT CAREING  ABOUT LIFE  I WONDER IF HE MADE IT
The crock hunter
The Queensland accent is so jolly
Wow , nice camera work
Wow...there is truth in the saying "no brains and happy without them". I agree, don't blame the crocodile for doing what it naturally does!!! Darwinism at it's finest!! Good on these guys for trying to alert him...!
It would have been so ironic if a crocodile suddenly surfaced next to baby smurf. He most likely would have went from whining about his rights to please help me faster than the IRS can freeze your bank accounts.
😂 when are people gonna stop interfering with Darwinism? It’s just selection! This guy is so dumb that his gene pool is trying to erase itself 🤣
He’d rather be ripped apart than admit he’s wrong. This is the main trouble with the entire world.
The guy on the board is your topical husband and the guy on the boat is a wise caring (what some would call) nagging wife 😂   Wife’s just trying to have you not die but sure go ahead, how dear I try to stop you 😅
Just because you don’t see the croc, doesn’t mean the croc hasn’t seen you.
Law of the fittest. If he wants to be a croc’s 🐊 large blue chew toy, let him.
You got big smurfs in your country
Bloke got more guts than brains he thinks the blue suit will make him invisible to all the crocs
My grandmother moved down from Pennsylvania to Florida and had a few ponds near her house.  She'd let her Boston terrier run around outside just like she had in Pa.  I told her that it was a bad idea.  She seemed confused.  I reminded her that she was no longer in PA and that there were dinosaurs hiding in the water waiting to ambush small mammals.  It's what they are designed to do and they've been doing it for millions of years.
Common sense ain’t so common anymore
So did the croc get his dinner?
Cairns, Australia.
I stubbed my toe right next to where he is standing.
Ive been there, literally heaven water quality for crocodiles.
No way😂 bro is splashign around in cairns bro
Foreigners get eaten by crocodiles all the time. One was a British guy, he thought he could go snorkeling far from people alone.  Another was a lady who beat cancer and in her infinite wisdom thought she should celebrate by skinny dipping with her friend in the far north, crocodile country. She had to watch her friend get eaten by a monster crocodile.
He’s too old to be swimming in a pool let alone Queensland
Natural selection....let him be bro...
Darwin award winner 2024😂
As an Australian, I'm loving these comments 🤣
What a fkn idiot. Let the crocs have him.😮
Imagine you’re trying to do him a favour and he’s angry and yelling at you ridiculous people today he should be saying thank you.
Common Sense, what is that he asked, 😁. Well mate, no worries here just go ahead mate, continue your day…..💭🤔🧐💬
Enjoy your lunch, Croco
Darwinism in action
Darwinism in action
A Class Fwit This ignorant fool surely had his North Queensland  Angel  Looking  out for him  On the flip side when buying a light paddle  board no doubts it had a buyer beware sticker on it Please use with caution
Too be fair the ish on land will 💀 you just as easily
The capital of the Northern Territory is Darwin, right? Quite fitting.
Well mate if he gets eaten by a crocodile that has fault dumb c****
DUDE MIND YOUR BUSINESS, an keep recording your scaring the crocks
Bet he's from NSW, where there's no crocodiles 😅💯
Never get in the way of mother nature. That's natural selection at work.
When an Australian tells you that you aren't being safe you should probably listen. They live in a land that has birds that will peck out your face!
Let the herd be thinned.
Who cares about what the insanely knowledgeable Australian from Australia in Australia says?
But the guy on the children’s paddle board is head to toe in UV clothing, but doesn’t care about crocs, wrong priority bud, wrong priority.
Let natural selection ensue.
Is he wearing crocs?
Darwin, C'MON DOWN!!
Do NOT do what this old man is doing unless you wanna feel what it’s like to be eaten by a croc..
Let him win the Darwin Award. Just keep the camera rolling, though.
What an idiot! Still, he's pretty close to Darwin .... where his family can collect his posthumous award! 😂
Darwin Award winner all the way 😂
This why I only swim in oceans and lakes here in South Australia only thing to look out for when swimming in Lakes or even river beds is the Red Belly Black Snake but even then they keep to themselves and also a Bull shark but even so out of these you'd have a better shot at winning the Lotto so ... Eeeh.  Also the Smurf sound's like a Victorian so makes sense has the Common Sense of a wet blanket
That's Crocodile Dundee 😂
Someone is looking for a Darwin award
This is just the human gene pool sorting itself out.
Apparently common sense is not very common 👀
The scariest thing is that he have the right to vote..
I’m in the Netherlands. Am I far away enough from Australia to be safe from it?🫣
Ah yes. Good old shark biscuits... But crocs aren't fussy. Ta-ta mate!
The dudes dressed like a cake for the crocs
The guy is a fool for not listening to locals warning, obviously only caring about his safety.  Never muck around with cross around
As a grown man I can confirm that one of the last things you want to happen is have another grown man tell you where you are😂
“You can’t tell me what to do!” *sheesh* So many people confuse actual reality with arbitrary “rules” they don’t think they should have to follow.
Honestly, I go to Australia and I'm just gonna assume that every body of water is full of crocs and great whites. Their chill without me there and I'm chill not being around them. Off to see someting else. Lol
Let the Smurf to the crocs
Well he is in a stinger suit, so he did SOME research. 😮
he looks like a tapas - croc blue cheese on white bikkie
Stupidity and one for the Darwin awards.😂🤣
Swim with gators = OK! ✅  Swim with Saltwater Crocs = Noooo... ❌
Warning a man about crocodiles in the water while wearing Crocs lol
When you find yourself the only one in a calm body of water on a sunny day - and the locals aren't going in - maybe pause, take a breath, and remind yourself: you're a tool, you've always been a tool, and maybe others are right this time like they are every other time. Then exhale. Namaste
They are idiots. You have a much greater chance of being attacked and taken by a saltwater crocodile than by a shark in Far North Queensland and the Northern Territory. You just don't swim in crocodile-infested waters in Northern Australia. Full stop.
Charles Darwin was right.
I used to live in cairns. Its always the tourists 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
“When you get done by it” 💀
Well I guess stupidity is around the world I thought most of it was in America right now
He's knows he's wrong by the end of it but his pride won't let him admit it. When the locals tell you you're not likely to survive the day if you continue to do what you're currently doing then it usually pays to listen to them.  "Just don't blame the croc!" 🩸🐊
High probability of a missing 23 chromosome i reckon!
As a fairly reasonable human being from Texas, California and now Massachusetts, I will say that if an Aussie ever tells me I shouldn’t be in the water that I’m currently in, I’m just gonna get out no questions asked.
😂😂😂😂😂 funniest clip going
Please just tell me this wasn’t an American tourist🫣 bc the most ‘merica thing ever is to argue with someone who is trying to save your hide about your right to not be saved😂😂😂
In Australia you do not even get close to water glass
It’s hilarious how people will never admit they’re wrong even under the most insane circumstances. What’s funny is you can hear him kinda concede but not outright  “ well there’s no signs ! ….. is there?  Oh …..” like yeah ur in big fkin danger bud And this isn’t like missing a private property sign. Your in Australia, you check before you enter the water anywhere ( you should do this with every water source but especially Australia)
At least the stingers won’t get him
Westerners and their "RIGHT TO PRIVACY" 😂😂😂😂😂
Let the natural selection be 😅
I love how paddleboard dude is still going to argue. Sir you literally have a crocodile biting your leg .... 😂
The gators where I live in Texas like to come up and bonk the bottoms of peoples kayaks and canoes
This bloke is being given very good advice and chooses to ignore it. His life expectancy is approaching zero. What an idiot.
Crocodiles gotta eat too!
One fewer delusional liberal flesh form about to meet The Darwin Reality check.
*cough* Natural Selection *cough*
We call these people deplorables.  Let Mother Nature do its thing.  Natural selection.
Old mate's a Temporary Aussie!!  At least he's covered for Stingers!!!
Real Australia is the top half. The bottom half are just city dwellers who pretend like they live around environmental danger. Old mate is clearly from the bottom half if you ask me.
If old mate had any common sense, he wouldn't have visited North QLD in the first place.
Let him be, his right to be on the food chain where he wants😂😂😂
As a mexican? I'm just watching and recording it..
Australia seems to have too much common sense man needs to move to Florida.
Listen to the man.  We Australians know our animals and which ones to be wary of. 🇦🇺
Idiots!😡
This guy is so petty that he’d rather be mauled & mangled by a Crocodile than admit he was wrong about swimming in that spot. What a maroon !
Trust the Aussie
🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️My grade 4 school speech was on Aussie crocs ‼️. At 9 years old I knew this was a VERY BAD IDEA 🤣🤣🤣‼️🫡🇨🇦
You sound just like your father mate and I don't even know who you are.
To be fair you can't really blame the crocodile once you get done by It mate.
Where’s the sign… points to 3 😂
Plot twist: *"Turns out this is Australia's version of Alex Honnold. And 'smurf boarding' in croc waters without a speargun, is what they consider a FREE SOLO."* 😂😂🤯🤣
When we were in Jamaica in 1993, we were about o walk in the water at night just to our ankles. Someone came over to us and told us there are things in the water that bite. We didnt go in the water. We were glad someone saw us so we didnt end up in hospital.
I live in south Georgia. Ive been told since childhood to assume theres a gator in every body of water. Ive seen gators in ditches, puddles, swimming pools. After they get about 7 feet long they are no longer scared of people lol
Yeah, if a friendly Australian warns me about danger... there's f-ng danger and im outtie
I'm not from down under but I sure do respect them Crocs 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Great example of someone that uses anger & arrogance as a defence mechanism for being less than perfect
you go to crocodile land and you go paddle in their  territorial water, when these people get snatched they practically asked for it.... I never swim in areas that  are known for crocodiles.
This is possible example of when the herd thins itself out.
Dumb man: "Oh yeah? Where? Where's the sign??"  Sensible Man: immediately points out 3 of them
In that place keep out ofthe water.Crocs are everywhere.
"Just leave me to do my thing and you do yours", It's as simple as that.  They're both Aussies, I'm with the smurf one, live and die on your own crazy terms...
For all you commenters. They’re both Australian! Might want to rethink your “if an Australian….” Approach
Let natural selection take it's coarse
Leave this man alone and let him do what he wants. Mind your own business! Idiot!
Even sharkodiles dont mess with Sonic
I'm beginning to think I'm an evil person. If I was the guy with camera, instead of warning him, I'd be hoping to see the croc have him for lunch because I've never seen that live.
Natural selection.  Leave old dave-o to it. 😂
The guy is basically saying..."there's no proof that people get eaten by Crocodiles..." as he paddles along. 😂
Exactly, DONT BLAME THE CROC FOR YOUR STUPIDITY
Never argue with an Australian when they warn you about dangerous wildlife.
Honestly
No that’s a crocodile recently seen sign😂
Dude is the real joker lol  And he's dressed in blue gear¡!!  He's a daredevil
Soooooo did this guy die?
when Ozzy is warning you about something you’re an immediate danger run swim paddle whatever you Gotta do, bro listen get out of that water I hope I hope he’s alright😢
As a Florida man myself I would welcome the challenge
Let evolution do its job.
Yep, ya just cant help some people.    On my way home i told a guy theres a mother bobcat by the railroad tracks. He told my cousin i was trying to keep him from walking on the road. A week later my cousin says "you remember that guy. He says theres hissing by the tracks." I said YA, THATS THE BOBCAT.       I told a bird hunter with a dog that the wolves are in the area. I later heard in town i was trying to keep him from hunting there.    Try to help people, try to be nice and this is what you get.
Crocodile have to eat too
People who need a sign are a special type of breed IMHO Trying to imagine the cavemen and the invention of hieroglyphics bcuz someone needed a sign to not pet the buffaloes
😂 I wouldn’t have said anything, I would have just watched…
If an Australian is warning you about the water you needa gtf out the water
The most “why are you recording this” video ive seen tbh

Don’t interfere with natural selection
I can relate to the paddler, if i was in that physical position, wearing that, I'm not sure any information would make me want to be in that position, wearing that, and also have nothing to do except return to my car, wearing that. Too much of an L I'd risk the crocs
Hes gotta learn the hard way dude
Fairdinkum
He’s from north Florida it’s fine
Totally Crazy no words
As a Floridian, I second this PSA. It’s better to assume EVERY body of water in Florida that is not chlorinated has a gator in it… and even if it’s chlorinated you better check twice lol
Y’all don’t see the vision. This guy is safe as long as he stays near the Australian accent
The funny thing is he is wearing a suit to protect from the box jellyfish :/
Must be a woke American
He’s an angry smurf.
Basically,  same happening in Africa. Tourists are warned, in nature reserves, to roll up the windows, lock the car doors and never exit the vehicle. Some ignore it cos they don't see the lions and leopards...just cos you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there.
Dude dressed like one of those speed skiers
...two words: natural selection
Whyd he have to tell him let nature run its course
Its a tug boat shows u how big the croc is
Ya know, when the crocodile 'does' him, he won't be left in any state to blame it.
Natural selection. Let him be. 😆
Always listen to Floridians and Australians in their play pens. They know what they are talking about.
if not aussie approved, you the insane one for doing it😂
A battle you can’t win! Once those jaws grab ahold, game over!
If someone wants to be an idiot, let em!
The stupidity and ignorance of this clown is unfathomable.
And this years darwin award goes to...
Don't get in the way of natural selection
He woke up and chose that just let it happen.
“Yea, righto” 😅
average libtard...
When an Aussie says be careful, listen.
1 less in the gene pool to worry about 😑
Aussie Karens are hilarious 😂 leave the guy alone and let him do what he wants
Documentation for his Darwin Award.
Who goes in the water in Australia?🤣
Aussie gets his camera on just in case something "cool" happens.
Darwan award candidate.  He just might win 1st place. 😊
This guy is determined to get his Darwin award.
I love the Aussie accent
His suit is so bad taste no croc will eat him.
We are the ONLY species on the planet that tries to prevent Natural Selection.... we NEED TO STOP and allow nature to takes its course... the world would be an easier and much more pleasant place to live if we do.
This is not him caring about the man's wellbeing. This is superiority complex. If someone rejects your invasion into their choice for their life and you continue invading or chastising then you are displaying a superiority complex.
I have a son he'll say don't worry about it. The natural consequence will occur and also its natural selection feels blunt for him to say so but it is accurate
as an australian, we r cowards, if u can swim go swim 🗣 its riskier to cross the road than swim in croc water, youll be right mate
If he doesn't care, let him be 🤷 some people dont care about death. Not gonna srgue with you if thats what you want
And the Darwin award goes too..!
If an Australian tells me there's something dangerous and I need to leave, I'm leaving.
Where’s the sign? Everywhere  look 😂
Them film the dam thing!!!!!
Actively looking to cash that life insurance policy.
Let nature run its course
Very decent Darwin award candidate! 🏆
His outfit 😂😂😂😂
An australian being cautious? I would jump out of the water if I were there man.
The iq of some people baffles me they made it to 10 years of age
it's called "mind your business" for a reason... people wanna act lile their blood aint tasty, let them
Someone left the gate open.....
But.... SIGNS.......
That is really frightening and he is just on his knees wow I’m scared for him
So….he’s dead right?
We Yankees call that FAFO. JS
Death Wish or ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE!!!
I bet the guys a doctor from Victoria
He's definitely from Florida, no doubt about it. They're even crazier than Australians 😮😮😮
It's called natural selection 😂
All wrapped up like a Christmes present and presented on a platter...bait.
Next recipient of the Darwin Awards 😅
Crocs are actually super chill and do net view human as prey. They only attack humans when stressed out or you come near their eggs
Remember kids, Australia is like Florida, except the civilians are the animals, and they outrank you 5 to 1. Australians are built off of this, listen to them 💀
Croc blocking!
Idiots like this are the reason poor crocs get killed.
Yeah man feed our pets , go crocodile
Ah look the croc cant read . How is he to know
Crocs hang around for a reason.
Why is he dressed like a teletubby?
It’s time like this, we need Ozzy Man to tell this dumb c#@t off for being a f&@knit for not listening to others!
Honestly, what was his mission there? What even was he paddling on?
He should run for Congress it would be right up his alley he has the Smarts for it.
Y save him, IQ points smaller than his shoe size!🤬🤬
I doubt he'll be able to blame the crocodile afterwards. 💀
Ah mate...
He must be a Democrat
Mind your own business.
The croc is in for a feast with this dumb bloke.
FAFO...
How will she blame thr crocodile when shes done for lad
Darwin awarded, he’s actually trying to make an argument about signs. Is this how some people live their lives. You’re in Northern Territory. Is there a part 2?
I’ve got no words. Maybe just…brainless.
The crocs love a boat ramp 😅😂 🐊
Must be a fellow American. Sorry, there are many signs and warnings half of our population ignores, because FREEdumb.
Honestly, I'm a little disappointed the crocodile didn't show up 🤔
Speeding up his Darwin award.
He has some kind of treaty with the crocs😂
Confirmation:  Not everyone wants to die in their sleep!!  Got it!
the man literally looks like a giant fish too  I like how he just didn't want to believe others.
Did the Aussie mean the pair of crocs on his feet or what?
Whamo
Shanon he’s got Cha son 😂
Short video
As someone who has mistakenly swam where there were crocodiles, this guy should really listen to the dude trying to warn him.
On a tiny board 😂
Fukin millennials
It
Free burley coming right up!
A Florida Man would still paddle there. They go in gator water ALL the time
The guy in the water in the weird blue wet suits sounds American
I am a firm believer of letting Darwin happen.
Croc blocker
Can't put brains in statues.
Guy should have just let Darwin win this one.
It's giving "Timothy Treadwell. "
Man wasted this golden opportunity to catch this on tape
A guy in a onesie on a paddle board in Croc infested waters. Pretty typical for QLD really.
Wh!+€ people do the dumbest things yo
Don't blame the sharks too !
Great camerawork btw!
Give him two warnings then leave it up to natural selection.
if you are travelling to australia have all sorts of sense . They jaws and crocs  and they both don't care which water they are in
A WORLD CLASS IDIOT.
Ok, so what happened to him?😮
Idiot 😂 !! I lived in Port Douglas and they are seen often at dawn 😳 on the golf ⛳️ course, a woman was taken at Xmas 2003?? At Daintree, and friends lost their dogs to them 😢 ❤❤❤😂😂 😅😅 😊
Since 1948 there have only been 442 alligator attacks on humans. 28 of which were fatal. I used to go canoeing all the time in gator and croc infested water in FL. I even went tubing and have seen them nearby. They tend to avoid humans.  They prefer small animals.  Sharks on the other hand, I'm terrified of!
Wheres your sign.   Lad i can seen the crocks on the bank pretty sure there in the water.
Righto
Listen to the locals!
Naaaaa nope not having it no way
Crocs seem to find more than enough dimbulbs to eat , judging by the number of people who die by them annually.
If an Aussie tells you don't do that, definitely don't it
Might be suicidal
with that accent about animals I'd instantly respect his information
Watch Darwin in real time.
First clue you're phucking up is when a local is telling you, you're phucking up. Australia is no joke. Literally the deadliest things on the planet all are in one spot
Even if there was not a crocodile spoted for 20 years I would not swim in waters they where seen even for 1 day only
You know it's a mess when someone wants the right to be eaten by a crocodile 😂
Maybe the guy's looking to receive a Darwin Award? 🤷‍♀️🏆🎖☠️
He wouldn't have to finish his sentence. Once I heard the word crocodile I would have gotten out so fast my shadow wouldn't be able to keep up with me.
IF ,"The feeling you get that Youre ABOUT to FAFO..." was a youtube video...
He's wearing gloves with his full lenght wet suit, it's not for warmth. He was told there are nasty bugs and jellyfishes in those waters. Just one thing his suit will not protect him from...a saltie.
another ignorant tourist
have fun getting nommed buddy
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Where's the sign?" said the guy walking into West Lake carrying an iPad and wearing Jordan 1 OGs...
😮😮😮😮😮 idiot 🙄
Nah man don't say anything. Let nature run its course. He might reproduce and the collective IQ drops another 10 points.
You warned the man. Now it’s up to the Crocodiles to eat him!
Please don't interrupt natural selection at work.
“Dumb ways to die … so many dumb ways to die …”
They have to eat too
Dude, just let Darwinism work itself out.
Honestly, I wouldnt warn him this hard. Crocodiles need food too. This man just wanted to be naturally selected.
The blue swimsuit is epic
Would have got more views if the camera man had just kept his mouth shut and waited for the croc.
I'm not arguing with an Australian telling me there's crocodiles in the water.
At some point you got to let nature just happen. You warned him he's prolly gonna be fine if he ain't ya tried.
You are really making Darwin mad by warning him mate.
What an idiot
Murphys Law 🤷‍♂️
Let him stay. He'll learn the hard way.
Dude, just let the man achieve his Darwin Award in peace, will you?! How rude!
Looks like some stoopid yank paddle boarding 😂
having seen dozens of these idiots on boogie boards, swimming, wading chest deep, etc., I no longer even bother with a warning..
Let him go. Population control.... Just confirms my theory most people are morons.
''I'm blue dabadi dabada ''✨
Dude filming is a bloke, let the man fight a crok
A fool and his paddle board are soon parted.
He feels comfortable in his blue chew suit
And the crocs ate well that day
Wow, l had to laugh
I heard a thing no matter how many signs they put up, people of this intellect will just ignore it and act like youre the idiot
Paddler is challenging him asking ‘where’s the sign’??.. It’s Australia!! It’s water.   Your guardian angel is doing mental gymnastics trying to explain what a suicide mission he’s on.  I’ve never seen someone so irritated that another person is trying to prevent him from dying a horrific death.
Me quietly filming until he ask. Nature documentary
I answer my own question when he said 'Yeah, righto!'
Well someone has to keep them fed and healthy lol
That's definitely how you get ate by a salty
This is the same as when a Hawaiian tells you not to get in the surf
An important learning moment was missed here
He must identify as a food source
I mean let natural selection do its job, lest the idiot reproduce and raise kids like him
I hope the croc doesn't get indigestion with that blue suit.
Ughhh dad! I’m making a tik tok jeeeezzzuhhh!
I guess there's no law against being an 'F'- ing idiot.  That must be his "Thing".
Kevin and Karen
Natural selection at work
I’ve never been anywhere more dangerous than the Australian outback or the Serengeti. The humans who live there are amazing.
Florida guys only hear story's about the Australians
Crazy humans. Darwin Loves it
I don't think he'll be in any shape to be blaming the croc after he "gets done" by it 😂
So this is what natural selection looks like
I'm pretty sure that's an American bullocks right there
Leave the Smurfs alone Dude .
This dude look and sounds like a libtard
When you wanna win an argument, but the debunk is literally surrounding you from every angle. Vocally, visually, and across time, species, and genders.
He looks like he's in a green screen outfit playing gollem
His father must be so very proud
He'd be the first person to yell out "HELP" if he was being eaten.
Has he dressed like a sealion to attract crocs?!
Should not warn these people. That Ozy woman's accent tho.
Well.. Sometimes, you just have to let them figure it out for themselves.
Paddling with his hands  in croc infested waters wearing a blue suit😂😂
He needs the Prime Ministers Boot! (Bart vs Australia)
Maybe the sign said...'crocodiles do not swim here"....that's a real sign seen somewhere
I'm not swimming mate 😂 I'm a floating hors d'oeuvre
I'd get the F outta there in a jiffy if that's me.
No comment needed 🙄
"Don't blame the crocodile when ya get done by it" ...
Oh, A Darwin award prospect!
Must’ve been a Florida man
Don’t blame crocodile!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What an idiot.
And the Charles Darwin Award for most Stupidest Person In The World goes to...
Crocs have to eat too.
I’d be concerned even I was being told it was ok, nevermind outright told it isn’t.
Natural selection at work..😂
Just let natural selection do its thing.
An amazing video if it’s real .
Maybe he is a frien of crocs
Allah will protect him. no need for warnings
it’s just natural selection at that point
Florida man travels to Australia
send all the migrants there for a swim
I swam amongst sweet water crocodiles when I was in Queensland. The locals said it was fine.
Give this man a Darwin Award
Natural selection, Guys! Let it play out 😂
QUEENSLANDER
Video only works when we can see something besides the ground.
Cleaning the gene pool 1 idiot at a time.
If he would have just said, "raise R shop teeth", that would have been the end of it.
Florida Man goes to Oz.
If I lived in Australia, I would stick to swimming in a pool!
Let the skinny teletubby do his thing.
Well if he's eaten recently, he won't be hungry now will he?
the paddler is an idiot , why not listening to a clever advice
Darvin will do his thing^^
You obviously don’t understand. He doesn’t buy into all the hype so that means he’ll be fine. That’s how it works. Manifest the outcome.
His he talking about his shoes
If the crocs don’t get him, the sharks will. its Australia!
Give it a name……dumbfxcker….
Considering it's Australia he's probably safer in the water.
Well he’s a big fish… let it sort it out. ✌🏽
Yawn.  People are so aggressive.  Live and let be.
Him listing off the signs sounds like that popular sound of which one will go
Look for demise you will find it
Hmm he didn’t see the sign !!
Was that Sterling?😅
The worst part is he's got the accent to know better 😂
Was he ok???
The guy warning is croc biased. Look at his shoes.
FAAFO
You’re in North Queensland mate have some common sense 🏌🏻‍♂️
I love auzzies swearing at morons while we stare at the concrete 😂
Idiot
Crocs swim ocean?
FAFO
Really is none of your business
Don't traumatize the rest of us watching you get eaten you selfish pri@k, Australians.
it’s similar to a toddler who cries maniacally when the parent forbids playing with the electrical outlet
So rude! Interrupting this guy’s gHumiliation ritual just to save his life?
Top water bait
Gator bait ???
He’s acting like he’s “breaking a rule” and not risking his life
Mind ur buisness mate. We don't care
Crocodile: come on, dont tell him about us. You kant. 😁
🐊: F U ... Why are you disturbing my lunch!
Morons
You warned him.  Unless he is family, move on.  You did all you should do.
Darwins law
Crocs are my biggest fear and I live in the UK
He was a snack for sure
Nobody really cares.
🤦🏻
Crocs gotta eat too man
In the beginning God created heavens and earth and he created man and woman, and men had sinned and separated themselves from God and sin entered the world, thus I  knоw  yоu  didn’t  cоmе  hеrе  fоr  it,  but  Jesus  lоvеs  yоu,  hе  d 1É d  fоr  еаch  аnd  еvеry  siп  оf  yоurs  аnd  yоu  аre  sаvеd  if  yоu  оnly confess you are a sinner, repеnt  from unbelief to belief  аnd  dо  things  thаt  arе  sаid  in  this  vеrsе  in  Вible  Romаns  10:9-10  cоnsidеring  this  оnе  1st  John  2:1-2, after that God will put His Holy Spirit in you and you will be saved and He will never leave you nor forsake you and will help you to repent o f all your siпs
He is even dressed as a fish
I see crocs on his feet.
Victorians
'No, I am entitled and if I want to paddle board here then I will. Sod the crocad...aaaghhhhhhh'.
“ don’t blame the crocodile 🐊 “…… riveting quote 🧐
It's unbelievable how utterly moronic people have become, I mean listen to this dingbat completely ignore legitimate advice just for the sake of being a stubborn little fool. Total disbelief at today's stupidity
Idiot!!
He’s been warned, mate.
So what happened then?
How crazy is this guy
believe it or not people go swimming all the time in australia
hes old he didnt get old by being dumb, he dont like being ordered around
leave him alone he didnt get to be that old by being careless.
Why has this guy got an attitude? Someone trying to advise him on how he can not get ripped up
I know Aussies are good people. However, their accents sound backwards af.
I grew up swimming in canals now can't cause of bull sharks.
People swim in those lagoons in Darwin as if there not full of crocs.
Personally SHOCKED 😨 at this Horrible cruelty to Animals ! Trying to STARVE those poor Crocs to death . Shame on You for trying to upset the proper laws of Nature !
Bro out there working hard for his Darwin award.
If you found yourself in a one piece suit sitting on a surf board then you're not fully aware by definition
All this man had to do was open his mouth  ….I would of jumped on that platform in a jiffy 😂😂😂 that accent would of alerted me …Australia is a place not be played with unless u were seeking to end yourself
Nature was about to select that man.
He wears a suit protecting him against jellyfish, but forgot about the salties …🙄
ldiot looking for Darwin award.
Of course it’s some idiot from another country
I'll bet he regretted giving him a warning after he showed his ignorance and complete disregard. I'm betting on the crocs here.
You have the RIGHT to be dumb, just tell us your name for identification of your body!
This is what happens when colonisers refuse to listen to Baama.  Crocbait.😂
Australia isn’t what it used to be. Victoria are moving north. So please leave
What a karen
Lol.     Common sense isn't common anymore
Natural Selection at its finest
You get a period of grace, actually. The croc's lived with very capable, cunning, meat-eating Aborigine fellas for 65 000 years. The croc would be watching thinking  "Yeah, nah . . . this is one of them tricks where all them OTHER guys I can hear, throw a long sharp harpoon through me each".
Are we there yet Papa Smurf?
Idgit...
The rekuctant 'yeah righto' at the end got me 😂
My issue is how the animal will be blamed and killed for something that the person did.
I was wasn’t wondering what happened to the Teletubbies, but Tinky Winky isn’t doing so well!
"Go ahead mate but don't blame the crocodile when you get done with"...what I told my ex's new boyfriend 😂 😂
Don't sniff glue, kids, or you'll end up like this guy.
Where i live, it's don't go up that mountain right now ! Lighting strikes in the afternoon ! In Winter, don't ski that ! Avalanche risk ! Later, Search & Rescue risks their lives retrieving the body.
Please let prove Darwin’s theory one more time.
Why interfere? Let him improve the gene pool by taking himself out of it.
And that was the last time he was seen alive.   "In the arms of the angel, fly away from here..." 🎶
this video is too short
This guy is American, isn’t he?
The only reason he is alive today is because crocodiles have evolved over millions of years to detect stupidity and will avoid it to protect themselves from it.
Ya’ll need to let natural selection just happen.
This sort of thing happens in Florida all the time. Us locals warn tourists not to get into any large bodies of water because of, you know, GATORS and Bull Sharks. But they never listen and that’s how we end up with a gator or shark dying unnecessarily becuase some idiot can’t understand the concept of listening to advice. For any tourists heading to Florida in the summer or winter I’m just gonna say this here:  We know the lay of the land, YOU DONT.
Dressed exactly like you’d expect this person to be
Where I live people get bit by water moccasins and alligators by ignoring warning signs. Usually from out of town.
Honestly, I hope he survived. Doubt he did anything in life to deserve to go out like that. Saltwater crocodiles can reach 21 feet long, they are the largest Reptiles in the world. You will not find a Reptile larger than a Saltwater Crocodile
If no one is in the water.  There’s a reason !!
This is very interesting because humans evolved to be successful as a social species, exactly like this by doing the exact thing the people on the boat ramp were doing. Then you have this guy, if he was born during prehistoric humanity he would have been one of the ones who didn't get his genes passed down, let's just say that
If an Australian tells me to look out for dangerous animals, I already leaving.
You warned him once and tried to help, after that he is on his own and whatever the universe has in store for him will occur—whether that is getting safely out of the water or becoming the blue gummy worm for the croc
Man I’m so curious where that dude is from
Hey man… he wants his award.   Darwin Award.
Natural selection 😉
Always listen to the locals, they know there stuff
What are you getting upset and swearing at the old fella?
Let the man get his Darwin award.
He was being a 'know it all'.........he was getting sound advice for safety but because his ego was hurt, he got all defensive....what an idiot
Aussie waters are infested with them...and I don't mean crocs. So many who don't want to know how dangerous their surrounds might be. Rock fishers are amongst the worst.
Then again, if he is left by himself, that could be to some advantage in a Darwinian sense...😊
Where's part 2.?
Just leave the guy in peace, let him do his thing, and if he does get attacked then that is on him, but every person should have the freedom to choose for themselves without people constantly patronising.
"Have some common sense"
I don't even understand what he is attempting to do.
When ego and humility can't mix and the rational mind doesn't scream" Can, you help me out of the water!?"
No need to inform the dumb. We have enough people on Earth.
Salty shows up and dude transforms from "Mate" to "Chum" in a millisecond......
Yeah, you listen to locals… lol it’s like when I tell people here in Michigan “don’t leave food out while camping, bears can sniff out the tiniest of food.” but they do, and wonder why their campsite gets attacked by a bear
Let the Darwin Awards begin... 😂
He heard you the first time. Mind your own business.
Local Australian man resists pussification.
comments.  "Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it".  G'day Ma'am...
If the guy is aware of what you are aware of and he tells you to kick rocks, then there is no more need for a continued conversation, let alone a lecture on not blaming a crocodile for his potential demise. And he's not going to blame the crocodile if he's no longer alive. Plus, it could be his last minutes alive, so giving some peace would be in order. Say what you need to say and leave it alone if your input isn't wanted any longer. Mind your business, like he heavily implied. Many Aussies seem like the authoritarian Karen slaves of the world, as displayed with the C19 era.
When HE started arking up i would have stopped talking and stood back and watched /  enjoyed the show 👍👍💯
How can he blame the croc if he is dead. Leave people alone and stop telling others what to do
Oh, where's Karma when you need her? What an idiot.
What an idiot. Crocodile fodder. Fancy not listening to the locals.
Please, I want to see this man swim further in that water.
Where is that fool from? Has he never heard that for everyone human in Australia, there’s a wild animal that will eat that human? If hear someone warn me off in an Australian accent, I will immediately take heed.
_"I CAME HERE TO SAVE YOU!"_
Karen's...
The question is do crocs eat smurfs?
He's not going to last long doing that
Have we learned nothing from Captain Hook?
Croc bait ooh ha ha 😂
No good deed goes over appreciated....
You know he’s an idiot because he’s wearing the uniform.
It's ok, he's got his anti-croc suit on.
He's obviously a cartoon character.
See the reason the UK doesn’t have these issues is because it’s such a hard nation, every natural disaster, poisonous animal etc immigrated to any other country. We deserve peace.   These fckers are your problem mate.
This guy obviously never saw Crocodile Dundee .
Dummy-o: I'm fully aware of it Also the same Dummy-o: Where are the signs?
Dudes attitude and attire strongly suggest that if he does see a croc, he’s going to be really upset at whoever’s “job it is to keep crocs out of the water”…..
Some people are just MEANT to eaten by Crocs, white sharks ,etc !
I will never understand people who don’t appreciate when people they do not know are trying to help them.
And this years Darwin Award goes too… hey where did that guy in the Smurf outfit go?
at least he's safe out on the water from drop bears.
Ready made Croc bait.... some people are beyond help🤣🤦
They might have saved his life
The smurf indicates he can read. Let him get eaten and don't even try saving him.
Do they hang around the boat ramp waiting for fish?
We have a winner of “tool of the day”
That’s the problem , people nowadays don’t have “common sense “!
This is what happens when you put Papa Smurf and Crocs into ChatGPT.
Crocs in the background going “SHHHHHH!” and making the slashing motion across their throats while drooling as they’re looking at the Smurf on a knee board.
Good grief, what's all the stink about?  All paddle-boarders know crocodiles NEVER attack, much less eat slow movig morsels dressed head to toe in BLUE tights! 😮
Darwin award
Anyone else have the morbid curiosity to see the follow-up video of him being eaten?
Porkchops are gunna porkchop i guess. 😂
Dude spent way too much time trying to warn him.
Morons like this  bloke never cease to amaze me. Like they have a treaty with crocs or sharks! Smh mehhh 🤨
Darwinism…
What a 🛎️🔚!
Darwin...
Nothing more annoying than Karen telling you you're not being safe
Crocs in Australia make the ones in our country look tiny in comparison. I’d never go near any place that had them
Usual MAGA-t
Do you know if he made it out of the water alive?
Darwin Award
She won't be able to blame the croc if she gets done for it.
Surfboarder will become croc feed & a statistic.
“Where were these guys when I needed them.”                     Steve Irwin.
Is that Steve Irwin.
Haha reminds me when I was on holiday in Queensland, me and my pal were walking along the beach and messing around and a guy shouts "Mate, don't walk too close to the water, a saltwater Croc can run out and grab ya, and mate, don't play around in the rock pools, box jellyfish or a blue ringed octapus can get stranded and sting ya, and mate, mate watch where your stepping and stop picking up rocks you might get stung by a Stonefish" 😂😂😂😂 we gave up on the beach and went straight to the pub.
I’m myself am tired of arguing with people in order to help them. Let him be. Enjoy your day good sir and God speed.
These people out there actively trying to prevent people earning a Darwin Award.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. 😕  But they obviously have good hearts...they don't want the crocodiles to be blamed when they eat him. ❤
“Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it” is my new favourite phrase 🙌🏻
"I know what I am doing." Also: "Where is the sign?"
i bet, the crocs are singing hallelujah after eating him... accidentally
An Australian could tell me there's a croc in my bathtub and id believe em
Why bother trying to convince him? Stupidity and ignorance are deadly.
Where's the sign??  THE SIGN?   You're in North Queensland!!!!!   It's basically Jurassic Park!
Any water in Australia is a gamble for many reasons. Can’t believe this guy is actually annoyed someone is trying to help him
It’s a tourist 😂😂😂😂😂  An American tourist 😂😂😂😂
00:13 crocs spotted
The smurf on the board is an example of a Darwin Award. 😂
His a stat at that point let him be 👍
and that my friends is what we call a halfwit!
Bro even wearing the seal outfit lol
Hard headed.
Let the Crocs have him. Natural selection.
He is exercising his right to win the Darwin Award.
Just let nature take it's course
"Sounds Great FUN!" ... said Crocodile.   Crocks will surely "Done" One, just as soon as they finish with 'Fish'.   lol   Be part of Food Chain.  *TRUTH* Dvours LIES *~~~~~~~~~{TrUth\;{°::;;;' . ~ >~=lie{{°c ` _ `0º}}=~-<* ~
Sometimes it's good to let natural selection just happen😮
Maybe when he's done paddling he can go play with a Taipan😂
wouldn't even come near a swimmin pool in Australia without asking if it's save
U carnt help some ppl think 🤔
Darwinism
Some foreigners don’t have common sense no matter what country they’re in.  If you can’t read a warning sign or understand the language just don’t.
When an Australian dude tells you to "do what you wanna do" you might want to reconsider.
What a drongo.
Hello I just wanted to to you that Jesus loves you and he wants a relationship with you. If you are willing to give your life to him and follow him then he will transform your life into something greater than you can ever imagine. Make sure to obey him and strive to be like him in all his ways and he will give you the gift of heaven. In Jesus' name I pray that you will accept him, Amen
Leave him be, he obviously wants to off himself at this point lol
Nope just let them do there thing it's none of your business even if it's dangerous, the police should be the only ones who can ask people to reconsider
Idiot
Me : Go ahead and be bait, I don't care if you don't.
Thus why i hate the phrase "have some common sense". It may be common to people living in that area.  Common sense is only common to those who have it.
Oh man the comments have not disappointed 😂ya'lls some creative bunch for sure.
He cares enough to wear a stinger suit but no concern for Crocs. I think we're dealing with rocks in his head.
He sound like American😂
Who cares about the sign 🪧? Locals are telling you are gonna get eaten alive if you keep doing that.
I'm convinced the Smurf wanted to commit suicide and was rudely interrupted by the Aussie mate 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Jheeze, Let the man commit suicide in peace.
He must be the Democrat version of an aussie lol
Let him earn his Darwin Award
Mind your won business let the dilltard get ate what is it any business of yours
Never underestimate human stupidity.
Next time those who can't hear must feel...come on crocs show em
Man: dude you shouldnt be out there. Crocs: dude he can't tell you what to do!
As a Florida adopted, just let mother nature do its thing...🥴☠️  If an aussie is yelling at you to get the FK out of the water, you must understand that you are 1 second closer to being UNALIVED!
Let natural selection happen! 😂
So glad he wrapped his body in a protective suit to avoid the deadly (and deadly paintful) stingers in Queensland! If only he'd thought through the conditions a little more.
Some people weren't ment to live long
Natural selection 😂
Remember the movie series faces of death back in the 80’s well it should start new episodes
TWO MINUTES LATER...🐊
"When you get done by it!" 😂😂😭💀  I'm weak af rn
Sir, SIR, there are giant lizards in the f*kng water, sir. SIR you're gona wana get out of the water a few seconds ago sir
When an Australian tells you it’s dangerous , you better believe if buddy …! 😭💀
Yup…when you’re not from the neighborhood, you need to listen to the locals….just like in Florida, if you see a lake no matter how small or big…just avoid standing in it or let your dogs run around. Just because you don’t see them doesn’t mean there not 2 feet in-front of you…and most gator attacks that happens here are from people who don’t live in Florida..
Instead of yelling at them, why don't you actually save him. Youre the idi0t with no common sense

He's clearly trying to die in the worst way he can imagine. Let him. And the crocs have to eat.
Crocs don’t eats smurfs🙃
The Crocodiles there are vegan, no worries at all
Florida Man VS Australian
"Hey mate, it's illegal to feed the crocs"! Regards
I wouldn’t say anything and just kept the camera rolling 😁 Look you heartless basta*ds Crocs need to eat too. It’s Christmas ffs..
So thisss is why that guy won’t do anything about gay rights
I thought a croc was going to jump out 🐊 you see I love crocs 😂 criekey crocs (Steve Irwin voice)😅
Distant cousins
Whys the dudes dressed up like a fish anyways lol.
He’s arguing with him. My God he probably just saved you from a horrible death!
Leave the man alone, he wants to feed the crocodile.😂😂
What it's like telling adults to avoid catching covid
"Don't get eaten by a croc" "Hey, you do you, and I'll do me." 😂😂😂
Probably American
Stop trying to interfere with natural selection
This cameraman is either very mindful for taking the camera off of a potential terrible sight for someone to see, or not very mindful because you took the camera right off the action!
Step it up on the videography, mate.
And.... this is why I don't feel bad for people in oceans that end up snacks
We are the only species saving the stupids and weaks.
You’re in Australia. Enough said.
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"
Crocodiles dont swim here. Confusing sign lol
To be fair,  crocodiles have NEVER been known to eat a Smurf.
That was Paul Hogan on the paddleboard.
This is natural selection at work crocodiles are known man eaters meaning they will stalk and hunt humans actively
Is that a tellachubby ?
You can't teach stupidity. Let nature take its course. 😊
El australiano sabe PERFECTAMENTE de lo que habla.
People love to worry about what other folks are doing don't they?
Don't interfere with someone's Darwin award ambitions!
Why is he paddling with his hands? Was he okay? We need an update. He should have gotten out
An American I presume.
Don't worry. Nature will take of this soon. Out of the gene pool.
Why do people act like this with NO COMMON SENSE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT HE GOING To FACE CROCK DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS THEY ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY.
Another horrible cameraman
Some rich librard
Oh come on!  The poor bloke just wants to feed the crocs.
advice given. if ignored it's up to Darwin's rules.
What’s the point of traveling to Australia if you can’t even swim? Taking my tourist dollars to New Zealand instead 😤 🇳🇿
Let him do his thing and if a Croc sees him it will sure do its thing a free meal is golden in croc land😂😂
Shouldn't he be wearing a mask ?
Looks like Australia has it's own form of Florida Man.
Then, the crocodile would be killed for having takeaway.  Should be fair game, if he's happy to stick his arms and hands in the water for them.  Maybe he wanted to be rescued, and end up in the papers;  you know, an attention thing.
I think this guy was having problems with his wife and didn’t want to go home.
I’m sure the aboriginal people told their ancestors the exact same thing, when the aboriginals were able to speak English. I wonder how many English people lost their lives to predators of Australia?
ya fakn drongo mate ! in 2 fakn minutes you'll be croc food mate !
This guy is wild.  4x 20ft crocodiles.  Perfect spot to drop in for a dip.  Idiot
Natural selection at work. 👨‍🍳🤣🤣
No no, let natural selection do her job.
I wish people stop harassing other people and let Mother Nature do  what it would suppose to do, all this shouting and telling off gets in the way of  Natural Selection.
Is he wearing a gimp suit?
Natural selection let it take its course/ to many smurfs In this world anyway.
Paddle board guy must think Crocs don't like blueberries?
Leave the surfer alone. He's doing Darwin's work.
Why women live longer than men
Crocodiles eat smurfs?
“Where’s the sign?” It’s Queensland, Australia. There’s bound to be a few predators hanging around wherever you are.
Natural selection i say
Crocodiles are horrifying and humans are on their menu, this guy is absolutely insane.
Guy couldn’t have been nicer about explaining the eating habits of the local amphibious apex predators but Mr. know-it-all (possibly my son) just wasn’t having it.
Did that guy have a drop bear fall on his head.
He’s 100% right our water ways are homes to these monstrous animals, but that’s life, Look I seen a croc in this clip! Can you spot it 😅😉 think out side the croc box you’ll spot it. 😂
This guy could give Wile E. Coyote a run for his money.
The crocodiles don't care about danger signs but you definitely should.
When an Aussie sounds like he's the sober commonsense voice - best check yourself.
You robbed Darwin of his scalp
Idiot
Fair play to you. Can't do anymore that that for people.
real prospect for a Darwin-Award
Blue hair blue bodysuit ect ect...
You cannot educate dumb! some just stay that way no matter what you have to say.
Bro just wants to be on the news😂
"Wherz ta sign" lol keep doin that. You going to feed that ecosystem some breakfast.
Guy on paddle board is a dipstick.
Natural selection..
One born every minute.....
Thanks for letting him know seriously. we don’t need more negative news about crocs.
WALLY
Eh, let the guy make his decision, if he dies, it's on him...
leave him alone...we need less idiots
Nuggets  grandson    ?
That’s funny he had the jellyfish wetsuit on , he’s worried about irukandji instead of the 20ft maneater
Where's the sign? One there, one there and one there  :D
He’s wearing an anti-crocodile suit The crocs will take one look at it And die laughing 😂
Australians are so wild and funny 😂
Get taken ya fickwit
Idiot, the croc will get shot if he gets hurt and thats inexcusable!
If you wait for the spring tides, you might be able to reach the ledge he's been tucked under with your gaff if it's the bottom of the tide ;-)
We will be seeing this guy again on 'Final Affliction'.
Good bloke for explaining it to the silly Smurf fella
There are better ways to sleep forever.
Me: immediately gets out of the water *Seconds later:* gets bitten by poisonous snake
Gees unbelievable.
Does this guy not realise that crocs are fricking giant prehistoric predators? One of the only predators to actively hunt humans? They are terrifying. This guy has a death wish
What a muppet, we shouldn't let tourists out bush.
Bystanders: Theese waters are dangerus! Man: …NO👶
Some people will argue even if their life is at risk 🙄🙄🙄
When someone from Australia tells you there’s something deadly in the water you better get up NOW.
Natural selection 🤷‍♂️
Crocodile are no alligator, they will jump up to take you down to water, even when you are not dressing like a 🦭 seal
Wow ! People are flat out weird 😮 & legend has it, that crocodiles love blue fin too. I’m only saying ( Smh ) < —— > both ways 🤦🏾‍♂️
What an IDIOT!
Some people just can't be told. Even if your trying to save their lives
If you’re an idiot, you are forever helpless. Sad reality.
Love that it’s a Brit accented man telling an Australian off for warning him about swimming in Australia.
As soon as I heard “righto” in the British accent, I knew this guy was done for.
You guys are way too nice. I would start chumming the water and get my video camera ready.
just let him go...lol They're too nice.
Right near my parents house... large crocodiles spotted there regularly.  A satisfied crocodile waiting to happen.
Dude is wearing Crocs yelling about crocs..
"I am fully aware of it" vs "where are the signs?" It's one or the other mate. Arguing as if it's a legal document.   At least the red will contrast nicely with blue when looking for what is left.
splashing in crocodile infested waters is nuts! the bumps on a crocodile snout are super sensitive to changes in the water surface and activates their hunter instincts. he's basically advertising himself as an easy meal
Welcome to the Darwin Awards, meet our next oblivious contestant. 😳
Let that guy win the Darwin Award
When the locals warn you, just listen and say thank you! If i tell you not to swim your dogs in the waters of Florida (especially one week after a child is eaten walking next to a lake in Disney!), don't tell me you do it all the time and never had a problem! Because when your turn comes, your cocky know-it-all attitude won't be saving you or your dog! As he says... "have some common sense!"
'No Sir, people aren't walking upside-down so Australia & crocodiles aren't real', said before the clampdown...of the jaws of the deadly saltwater croc.
Is the smurf a tourist 😂
That teletubby isnt being very cooperative.
He's got his anti-stinger suit on. It is best to be protected against the Irukandji jellyfish as a sting from the Irukandji can cause fatal brain haemorrhage.  On the other hand, it's not going to protect morons against crocodiles, which can cause full body haemorrhage.
Should have not said a word and just watched
Leave him be. Natural selection.
I was fishing on an ocean rock platform in central Queensland with a group of friends and every second fish we hooked was getting hammered by large Bull Sharks as we brought them to net or gaff range . Next thing , 3 people on boogie boards came paddling by . We warned them about sharks in the area and they just blew us off . I couldn't believe what I was seeing .
First of all, the whole planet knows Australia is not safe anywhere, and Australians think we're wimps about it. Soooooooo, when an Australian is warning you, rest assured you are certifiable for not listening.
Ey man if the guy wants to be an afternoon snack let him
Blue Smurf on the board for breakfast 😂
Suicide ?
Idiot
And when he gets eaten, his parents will blame and sue everyone else for his stupidity
Why did you tell him when you could of had better video footage 🤣
Saltwater croc is not your friend
Smurf with a deathwish
Crocs love smurfs!!😂
Why post this useless video?
Same thing in Florida. They are big signs that say don't swim and yet they swim
In America there would have been no Aussie to save u there would be 100 people with there phones out recording
those Aussie Marine commandos did a exercise in a SEA country and those guys are better at jungles and wildlife😅
Australians let salad plate sized spiders stay in their house to catch insects.  Listen to him!
Trump voters are everywhere, apparently. 😢
I read the story about the 3 or 4 kayakers who were decided it would be a great adventure to travel down a croc infested river. There was one survivor and he witnessed his buddies being ripped out of their kayaks by the crocs. Darwin awards were given freely that day....
Some people just cannot be told.
Some people can't be told,  listen to locals, you shouldn't need a sign cos the crocodiles can't read!
Why do u need to explain so much…1 here 1 there and 1 more over there…it doesn’t matter how many…when one person is suicidal just let him be
When an Australian warns you about safety and wildlife, smart people obey.
Thanks for the video, I was really wanting to see the bottom of that boat.
In California that fella would be considered a “jaycat”
🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
Is that right😊 continues to paddle towards crocodile...
these people should stop wasting their breath.
When he asked “where’s the sign?” did anyone else think someone should have handed him a little sign reading “I’m a special kind of idiot”?
just stand back and keep the camera rolling
You’ve told him as much as he needed to hear, if he dead then he dead
Who let this Oompa Loompa out of the factory
Natural selection in process.
Florida and Australia are distant cousins!  Bottom line ask a local before getting in the water!
The same people get out of their cars in the US to take pictures of bison
Darwin.
What is he wearing?
He will soon be extinct
The video was great, the comments are gold !!!!!
I'd like to bet hes from Florida; thinks he knows everything. He says, "HOW DARE YOU TRY AND KEEP ME FROM GETTING EATING ALIVE?!"
Local sounds like Jack Miller
The guy is warning him of crocs while wearing crocs . 😆
I did some paddleboarding in Florida in alligator/snake habitats. The water was also reddish brown which made it extra creepy. I was just waiting for a gator to jump out but all I saw was a snake
ah come on the crocs got to eat some thing
If Steve Irwin can do it then so can I
it's called a video only if you focus the camera AT something besides the dock!
Some blokes from down south are totally clueless when it comes to Saltees
Thanks for showing us the beautiful concrete for 1/2 the clip.
Wow?
Smart people.  Don't try to save them.  😅
Too much conversation. Just let him know then enjoy the show.
Bruh I got so upset when he tried to argue back.
I think Blue Santa has a death wish.
Crocs love little blue touristy snacks. He’s fine mate.
This is how Darwin's theory plays out 😂
And then put a rescuers life in danger…
Natural Selection right there! Grab some popcorn and watch the show 👍👍
Angrily trying to help someone. Sounds like a New Yorker 😂
That's not a noife, this is a noife.
I spent time in northern Queensland, you DO NOT just go into the water..   Crocs, sharks, stingers..
What a plonker! Croc tucker for sure.
Stingers out number crocs
Don’t use crocodiles as surfboards.
When an Aussie warned me that a croc ate his dog right where I was swimming, I got out of the water.  When Aussies are scared, you should be scared.
The irony is the guy warning him about Crocs has Crocs on
As a counter argument to that warning, there’s not going to be much possibility for the paddler to get upset when done by the crocodile
Some people don't have common sense!
I grew up at this beach in Cairns, there's crocodiles everywhere on this side. You can see their nests on the banks and their fresh slide marks going into the water.  If you go at sunrise to the other side of the beach, there's often 3 crocs catching the morning sun.  I shiver at the thout of hiw many times a croc was probably looking at me when j swam here, but croc numbers have also increased since I was young. There's also heaps of sharks at this spot and in the waters near here, one section nearby is a shark breeding ground.
Idiot
Darwin...
Have some common sense!? Common sense flew out the windows on this person! 😂
Ok...I wonder if this older gentleman on the paddle  board has dementia.  I'm not joking.
Don't swim in Australia... That's it!
Unbelievable!  Have some  common sense!!!!😂
Daaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Natural Selection
Mr IQ of the year
Here in the US, we call that gator bait. You have crocs and we mostly have alligators. Same ending as with the croc. Darwin had a theory on these people. 😂
Stop yelling at him! Just let the man get eaten in peace! Geez his stupidity and a hungry crocodile waiting for him are doing us all a favor. lol
🦈🦈🐉🐉🐉🐉🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐍🐍🐍🐍they will get you!!!!!
“Watch out for the snakes too but don’t blame the snakes if something happens to you”
Let him earn his Darwin Award! The earth is overpopulated.
So sorry the Aussie had to work so hard to impress on this man how much danger he is in.  Some are just thick headed.  But you know, crocs don’t care how thick,  they can still bite it open.  Listen or die man!!!
It's the Crocodile that pays the price for idiots like this, the Crocodile is just trying to survive by hunting and eating, people like this don't care they disrupt an eco system just to have some fun, selfish and reckless
Aww, stop messing with the Darwin Awards
That sounds like and F'ing Brit🤦🏽
The stupidity is stunning
No worries mate, it's called natural selection He must've seen a sign that said: 'crocs are racists they don't like blue people'
Darwin’s law
Considering the common sense of the Australian olympic breakdancer RayGun this doesn't even shock me.
Natural selection awards!
You're in Australia. If being killed by wildlife isn't your #1 concern you're doing it wrong
I wouldn’t even get in the bath in Australia
Wearing a blue suit crocodile will think he is a fish ❤
Definitely an Australian liberal, they're some of the most incompetent people in the world
Anyone know what happened to him?
Future recipient of the Darwin Award
Of course this guy is going to argue with someone trying to save him from danger. We knew people like this existed en masse when COVID came along and people refused to wear masks and get vaccinated. Some people always want to be right even at the cost of their lives.
How come this idiot can believe a sign but not actual living Aussies ??? Maybe he's a fast food delivery man!
Some people are SO rebellious and they just HAVE to break the rules and forget about common sense! 🤨🤔🚩
At this point you just have to let natural selection run it's course
Do you really expect someone wearing a dumb outfit like that to be smart?
Darwin will take care of him. His statement that he was fully aware is the incontrovertible proof that he isn't.
i hate people like this. they’re the reason these beautiful, usually relatively harmless animals get such a bad rep.
Natural selection at its absolute natural best.
Indeed. It is common knowledge that the one varnint Crocs want no smoke with is the dreaded Smurf. 🎶Papa dont take no mess🎶
Guess what, if that dude got done by crocs, the family will still blame crocodile and people there, because not tell them more "specific" about the danger.😩😩😩
That blue man suit is a vibe! What is he actually doing? Courting dolphins??? Also, when crocodile dundee tells ya there's a croc, believe him.
Darwin’s theory in action.. The demise of the stupidest
This reminds me of the lion king. Where timone and pumba hold a luau for the lions hyenas
Natural selection in full swing
Is there a part 2?
The 11th commandment: Don't enter the water in North Queensland, Australia.
It's NorthQueensland mate! Have you seen the movie "Jaws"? Well you know the giant shark from Jaws? He's afraid to swim in North Queensland mate
Some like to be patronising rather than informative as it helps their ego.
Stop, stop, the Darwin awards for 2024 has not received all its entries yet.
I found Aussies very cautious people which is  a good thing. They're definitely not the daring type. 👍
I wouldn't even be in that situation. Some people so dumb smh
He hasnt watched animal planet ….
That man is a total idiot. A local tells you it isn't safe. IT ISN'T SAFE !
Exactly what the men saying on the shore. Don't blame the crocodile 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Croc to another croc:  "I didn't expect a giant blueberry to be so crunchy!"...
Let him alone Hopefully he hasn't mated yet 😂
Pretty old to be a rookie. Priorities are subjective but not many argue that remaining alive isn't up near the top.
Let natural selection take its course.....
Look you just can't un-darwin some people.
Too stoopit to know he is stoopit.
you said your peace, you gave him the warning, let the fool learn from experience.
DARWIN AWARD COMING UP!
That guy is just begging for a Darwin award.
Guy is just trying to keep the guy whole.
This is why ppl get killed
Darwin doesn’t like these safety tips.
Darwin Awards material...LOL!
There is a rare disease where people have the craving wish to have their left leg be amputated...others their right, or both. Some have the wish to be eaten by a tiger...This man has also a more common disease, it called stupidity.
Yep I got yelled at for walking on a beach 10 meters from the water in northern Australia. Crocs are no joke.
I was waiting for somebody to learn a lesson! Disapointing😢😂😂
id be shocked if there wasnt a large amount of tourists getting eaten by wildlife in Australia. That would mean that the average person uses their brain.
Best Video Ever
Idiot in the water
This guy is obviously a superhero so he will be fine
People are dumb
Dont blame the croc 😂
This guy is eager to win a Darwin award!
Then they will go around killing crocs because he got eaten by crocs
Yeah, righto 😒
This is just evolution taking its course. If he's too dumb to avoid the crocs, he doesn't belong in the gene pool
You Aussies need to come to Florida where we swim in murky waters with alligators 😭
I expected:  “five minutes later” and a footage of the board floating around
If i cant see through the water I'm not swimming there. What an idiot .
Croc's alway's read the signs Ensuring they know it's Ok to Attack then...😮‍💨
Crocs never ate a smurf before, time for a treat
When I was in Australia a few years back a guy came on the news and said in a very sort of matter of fact voice 'And in other news a tourist was eaten today by a crocodile in Queensland' shook his head and just moved on.
Natural selection 👌   😅😅
You tried to tell him sir. He doesn’t wanna listen then let him find out
Typical antivaxer
The kind hearted gentleman who warned the upcoming Darwin Award recipient that there were not only crocs in the water but also on his feet. Has anyone seen crocs made out of actual crocs?  Aah, nothing beats watching mentally retired people living their life to the fullest on YouTube on a Sunday morning from my bathroom throne.😏🤌
Florida man here  this was a common conversation with people who thought gators are only in a zoo.
yeah rightoh. lol famous last words
Whatttttt
Crocodiles favorite food happens to be human blueberries 🫐
These comments 😂🤣😭😵💀🏴‍☠️🪦
For context for our American counterparts. Just like in Florida, how can you tell if there's crocs in the water in the northern states of Australia? The answer; If the water is wet.
That's just absolutely crazy 😧 isn't it ? I mean sign or not. Ask locals and use google. Type in are there man eating crocs in Cairns 🤣 absolutely astonishing someone could be so dumb 😊
Let him get done by it. We didn't get this far in evolution because we stopped idiots from being idiots. We just watched and learned from their mistakes. Nothing of value will be missed if a croc decides that the blue idiot on the paddle board looks like a nice mid-day snack. Every sign was created because idiots lack common sense.
The irony of him being in a stinger suit
😂fukn people
In his defense, there are crocodiles every five steps in Australia
Where are the signs?   Oh so you are the reason we need to have common sense put on signs everywhere. In this case, do whatever you want. We can only win here.
Is that coz the camera man is wearing crocs?
This Joker needs to be up for the Darwin award of the year. Some people insist on serving themselves as lunch !
It is a grown man dressed as a Telatubby  on a pizza box. You gave him a chance.
Australia - 1 Weird guy in slender man suit gently feeling the water up  - 0
Ah yes - natural selection in action.
I was working in London & we had an Aussie guy come & work for us. They took him to a job up in *Birmingham* & when he got back I asked him where he'd been.   He said - _"I dunno mate but we went out in the Bush!"_  😂
"I'll do my thing, you do yours..." & the crocs will do theirs! 😕
I mean … have y’all been to Florida
He’s every crocodile’s dream
I swear I saw a smurf today.
Stubborn like a rock
Australians sound so British when they're telling some pleb to have common sense.
Survival of the fittest at its finest!
Eh, why bother? Natural selection at its finest.
Before I did anything in Australia I spoke to the locals.
Listen to the guy, he's even wearing Crocs.
Who's the cameraman? There's a dude paddling through croc infested water and he's filming his own feet. He's gonna miss the good bit!
I'm an Australian and if they say it's a croc get the croc out of there Mate otherwise ta ta
I say watch the show if he wants to be dumb lol
I kayaked up the Daintree River once and was absolutely excorciated by locals when I came back to the ramp 😂😭
dont interfere with natural selection..its there for reasons
Natural selection
I can even begin to understand why people would live in North Queesland
You did your best to warn him, time to let Darwin take over.
So dumb 😂
I'm fully aware of it... where's the sign? XD
nosy karen just hates crocs coz they're brown, he's just tryna swim with the homies
Insane Western fools.
A wise man heeds a lesson promptly but how can you instill some kind of sense into a fool? This was begging to get eaten alive on that day.
What's the benefit of that swim ?
It would have been funny if the guy on the water looked at the guy on the dock and said no worries I'm from Florida 😂
The blue wiggle is totally mad! 😉
Bro paddling on that board like he ain't scared of NOTHING except gargamel and a cat!! 😂😂😂
Crocs are dow below like "I ain't never had a Smurf, have you Billy?" " No Bob, can't say that I have mate"..." Bob (scratching his head in confusion) Do you reckon they taste like chicken? " 😂😂
The man has never won a price in his life, so now he's going for the Darwin award!😂😂😂
Why he's diaguised in seal... so funny. Crododiles don't hate seals son i'm fully aware!
Go swim my friend 😂
What an idiot. I'm in Borneo. We have crocodiles in the drains in residential areas. The only place I'll be swimming in are hotel's pool.
At this point I am just happy the crocs will get a free meal. He's literally annoyed that people don't want him to die. How crazy is that? So just move on, let him be, he'll be history soon enough.
The crock is on his foot
But what if he’s Florida man on vacation
What an ignorant, entitled idiot
Is he from Melbourne?
Insane !
That idiot will be the next Darwin Award winner. Hopefully he didn't contribute to the gene pool first, because there are already way too many idiots living in it now. 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Some people are just retards.
hes the lost 4th blue man from blue man group !
yeah righto ! their just big swimming lizards 🦎 whats the big deal !!! 😮😢😅😂
I have witnessed this kind of ignorance.  Gotta listen to the locals. Go woke, go crocbait
Perfect nominee for a Darwin Award.
Darwinism
Natural selection....
Did he become lunch?
They like waiting for blue wiggles too
Australians have the weirdest arguments and life ever!
He’s watched gator boys and croc hunter. He’s got this. Mind your sense. And have the camera ready 👀☠️🇺🇸
🤡
Leave it to the stuck up brit to not listen to the native Australian
Not often Darwinism comes to Aussies in this way
We should be able to see what happened to the dude
The guy on the board could be in contention for this year's Darwin Awards.
He’s fully aware that uh well they know him enough so they won’t mess with him because he’s got that large wet suit and they won’t try anything with him
🙂please obey the crocodile signs
Its the s word by croc 😢. Call the authorities.
That guys about to get some different pronouns.
I was on Manly Beach once and braved shark-infested waters right up to my calves! 😂
Darwin Award Winner!!!
Why is why I prefer living at the beach in South Australia.
Give it a rest crocodiles have to eat too
Some crocodile is gonna think he's found Nemo.
Australians box kangaroos--listen to them!
Natural Selection at work before your eyes.😊
Common sense isn’t common. That’s what I call irony. 😂😂😂😂
Croc be like " Never interrupt my lunch when he is making a mistake"
If an Australian won't do it, don't.  Guy might as well be trying to pet a moose 🫎
Aussie here, true fuken story. Two ladies were holidaying on a picturesque North QLD beach, just strolling along, enjoying life, enjoying conversation....a beautiful sunset. A croc snuck up behind them unseen, unheard, grabbed one woman and took her away screaming...into the sea...never to be seen again. Just sayin'
Do crocs like blueberries 🤣
I heard he was there to feed the crocs.
I really hope he did not scare away any food from the poor crocodile. I mean it was even served on a plate.
This is how Nature cleanses the gene pool
We have like 10 billion people in this world. Let the crocs have this idiot. He had his fair warning, and decided to be argumentative. Let Darwin take the helm on this one. It's not that we're relying on that person for some major breakthrought in science, clearly.
I cannot believe that another Aussie  does not know about crocodiles in North Queensland.
You should just mind your business
Don't bother him mate ...just make sure to get it in video and share it with us. ....Darwin educated the world  about how nature sorts us all out between the dumb and the dumber
Just making it 10,000 comments
The guy seems to be alive still so....
Hey!  Crocs have to eat too!
What a wankstain xD
please tell me he finds the crocs.
Come on,, That foreigner knows more than you,,, Just because YOU were born and raised there, we all know your just trying to ruin that foreign dudes fun,,, Admit it!
His a Blue Bottle Jellyfish with a attitude
“Werrrrron borrowed and stolen tooime hehrrrr mate, dnt be so shtoopud” 😂 no, but do.
People like this also put others at risk who try to save them!
He one of those people who learn by doing, rather than learning by listening. All good. He'll get to see a nice salty up close soon enough. I've had my fair share of close encounters... fun times
Great advice . Hope he had the sense to take that advice. 🙏
Just let him swim. We need more natural selection or humanity gets dumber and dumber
Leave the tourist alone. They make good fertilizers.
Same idiots with Grizzly Bears here in Canada.
"I am the Walrus"
He wont blame the croc, unlike sharks they don't just take your arm
You inconvenienced him saving his life...see take down the warning signs and let life silort the wheat from the chaft
How crazy is that!?
They even have maga down under. Too dumb to survive.
WOW!! As an aussie that lives in Queensland, and near the beach, this man is either dead or very very very lucky!!!
“I’m fully aware of it..”.  Nek minut, “Where’s the sign?” …
So if it ain’t the croc, it’s the shark, blue ringed octopus, and if you can then crawl onto the shore, funnel web, brown snake or just an Azzie man…….
It’s natural selection mate leave him beeee
What in the Blue Man Group is gong in here?
If a man wants to get eaten by crocs and k ows exactly whats he doing, thats fine live your life, but when a man does a dangrous act and refuse to believe the consequences hes fricken dumb
And this months Darwin award goes to.. Moronic wet smurf man
Natural selection 😂😂😂😂
Both need to chill
Natural selection at its finest
I was in Florida a few years ago. In a canal a few guys taking a break from doing some landscaping, jumped in swimming around. A man yelled out to them it wasn't smart to do that as there could be sharks.... as dolphins are regularly seen in it. They kept swimming and a large shark started to thrash about.... chasing something about 15 feet away from them. They were out and back on the lawn in about 5 seconds.
Dumb c
Pussycat had to wait for a woman to tell him. How he responds
Let nature take its course
Dont ruin the crocodile meal of the day
The smurf sounds like he is from Melbourne.
Guy on paddleboard watched too much Crocodile Dundee movies.
Lost member of blue man group
A bit of pride going on here, not sure how the convo started sounds like it all got a bit aggro.
Natural selection at work in the wild.
Where is the footage of crocodile?
Do you get the feeling his normal mode of transport is riding a pushbike in Lycra
Jokes on you all, I want to pat the cute dinosaur.
When being rebuked, take it as growth in wisdom.
Crocodile here, don’t mess with my lunch
Does anyone know if the smurf got a Darwin award
Well if he gets eaten who's fault is it?
The world is really full of idiots😮Now I know why there are crocodiles😊
"No I'm not, I'm in a Wetsuit".
sounds like a discussion i heard from momty python and the holy grail
Let him Go
Dudes wearing crocs too 😅
Crocodile: “mmmm a floating blueberry cupcake extra fruity”
You respect a Aussie when they tell you something.has the most dangers in the world,he should thank them fact
If I were to be told off like that after giving good advice, I wouldn't say anything anymore, just film so that I can have a spectacular video later.
Why’s he need a sign…I wouldn’t swim anywhere there.
Leave him alone you clown
Another bully telling others to have "common sense."
If he wants to argue while you're trying to save his life,  let natural consequences commence. 🤷‍♀️
Let natural selection do it's thing
Thats the whitest Chinese tourist I've ever seen...
Natural selection…
I hate Australia.
Natural selection comin'
Don't you mean the crocs hang around waiting for fish bait on paddle boards 🤣🤣🤣
Leave the guy alone. As long as people want to/are applauded and encouraged to go climb mountains and turn themselves into icicles, then this man can freely paddle in croc filled water. Chances of something going wrong are probably about the same.
We been doing it forever,only now we have cameras and phones to tape it and show ery body,we've made it here on our own thousands of yrs without getting eaten,this goose trying to get view that's all. He's an Aussie not a tourist.
He has sense enough to wear a stinger suit but then swims with salties. I just hope no kids witness a Smurf being ripped apart.
From Sydney or Melbourne? Bets are open....
Let him FA&FO...🐊🤣🤣🤣🤣
He's most probably a lefty who thinks that crocodiles being dangerous are just a far right conspiracy 🤣🤣
lol it's up to him if he wants to play with a croc who to tell him no
Kook!
Idiot
It's like my gamer friend always says; "Don't go to Dragon Mountain if you don't want to meet the dragon".
When locals told you what do's and don't better listen to locals because they know better..having fun can be anytime but losing your life in no time is not worth it..
He's a bit special... 🤦‍♂️
Faut le laisser nager ! Sélection naturel et un idiot de moins sur terre
Oh please there are Karens in every country... If you wanted him to do as he wished then you wouldnt be yelling at him and telling him to have common sense. Let the badass Australian wrestle some crocs in peace!
The lands of Darwin.
Dumb fool
Darwin would be proud of this guy for weeding out his defective genes, too bad it’s late in his life and God knows he has no doubt already bred and produced sporty offspring.
"I got this." - Charles Darwin
And the Darwin award goes to 😂 this nincompoop on a plate
It's called natural selection.... Let the crocs 🐊 have a good day with Goofy 🤙🏼
just film it for the darwin awards ext time!
The "inaudible" bit he says: "They are just signs, aren't they?"
Person must be a Floridian.
You're not wearing your face diaper get em 😂
Sometimes…you just have to allow natural selection to take its course
Just leave it to Darwin
Everyone isn't meant to make it...😅
This cant is off his rocker. He's concerned about the Blue bottle jelly's, well flapping about in croc infested waters..
hes wearing the crocs.......
Just an Australian trying to protect the local crocs from indigestion!🤭🤣🤣
Trash takes itself out mate LOL
When you have an Australian talking to you about common sense, you gotta take a strong look into the mirror
I would heed this mans advice!!!
Thank you for your warning good Aussies. Rude and ungrateful fool you are warning
At least you don't have to worry about sharks.
Common sense is nonsense in today's world, you're better off leaving him alone before Woke media turns it around on you for discrimination against Crocs
He has a death wish and does not like people interfering with the way he wants to go down.
I keep waiting for the update.....
Looking to get a Darwin award 🥇
Let him have the Darwin Award!
perfect Darwin Award candidate!
Nothing like serving yourself up on the dinner plate for the critters that WANT TO EAT YOU!
Please tell me I'm not the only one to notice the cam guy is actually wearing Crocs. 👏
Florida. I don't think there's much difference between Crocs and gators, once they lock on.
Thick as a brick must be a Brit.😊
You can’t help stubborn
No gratitude given when Aussies trying to care & help, they know their territory well.😢
I bet he’s “American”… 😂😂😂
When a local warns you about a croc get out
There is an upside. At least all croc infested waters can be considered self -cleaning gene pools.
WOW ❤
I say, let Darwin be Darwin.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he’s said where’s the sign
Paddle with a chicken drumstick in each hand. Let the crocs know you're a friend.
Liberals have no common sense. They have a sense of entitlement.
The Darwin do his thing😂😂😂
Let him do his own thing , the crocs can do their own thing too 🤷‍♀️
…and don’t blame the crocodile 😅😅😅
F around and find out…the hard way.
😂😂😂😂good lord human
I was in Port Douglas in 2008 and two British kids ran through the shopping mall by the marina to go swimming in the marina. Was going to tell then no way they're going in the water, but the shop assistant beat me to it....they were genuinely put out that they couldn't go for a swim. Just the day before we had been on a boat trip and encountered "Buster" the local 15" salty....not far from the harbour entrance.
Darwin Award contestant. Common sense is rare in humanity.
Not everyone has the sense to listen to an Aussie when he's trying to tell you there are dangerous animals apparently 😂I mean if even an Aussie is saying don't do it it's definitely a red flag you shouldn't ignore.  It's a common misconception that Crocs are slow but when they decide your dinner they get mighty fast mighty quick!
Captain save em ! 😂
this is how british people keep their population low
There is no helping some people 🤷🏻‍♀️
Whilst wearing crocs as well 🤣
He's gonna be Crocadile done de😂
Natural selection
Please do not interrupt Darwinism at work. It disrupts the natural chain of events and provides idiots time on this Earth, that they wouldn't ordinarily have, to propagate their flawed genetics.
The “don’t tell me what to do type” 😂
lol let him go mate, dude wasn't providing that much to society
Natural Selection
“Have some common sense” he says to a guy dressed like a reject from the Blue Man Group.
Common sense isnt much around anymore...
What a Donk😂
Totally irresponsible and selfish person - if he got caught by a croc then it’s these other people that have to live with what they saw and felt
Let him earn his Darwin Award..
he had saved money his whole life to finally afford a board,. First timer
Love the words: ...but don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it 🎉
Great video! Especially the last half that gave me that wonderful view of the boat floor! 😂😂
He's been warned 😢
But wait. Full suit...little board... the guy is not the full ticket bless him.
He said where’s the sign 🤦🏼
You can’t tell a liberal anything. They know everything. He probably loves crocodiles 😅. Wants to make friends
Some people cannot be told! You can't fix arrogance and self righteousness.
darwin has him matey!
What a dope.
Thank you for telling him people are cringe 🙄
Why is everyone so concerned with “saving” others?  The guy is wasting our air and water let the crocs have em! 🐊
Just ask the grizzly man how that worked out for him!!!
*And the Darwin award goes to ...*
What a spaz brain!!!
Darwin wouldn't be too happy with the guy trying to be helpful.
“You’re in North Queensland have some COMMON SENSE” 😂😂😂  As if it’s common to be from North Queensland.
lol. they ain't from Louisiana. that's for sure. we swim with the alligators all the time.
muggle
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it"  Savage.
Let Darwin’s theory work out
My back is screaming in pain jyst watching him bent over paddling down river like that.😅
Sense is not common.  🤔
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it
Some people think they know best
This is Darwinism at work. Do not interfere.
Darwinism at work here
Look, the man made it this far.  Perhaps he does not fear death as you do.
If an actual Australian human is telling YOU,  THAT YOU... are  being unsafe.😅  stop immediately and run
lol I’m fully aware of it where is the sign?
Wearing crocs while earning someone else about crocs is pretty funny actually 😅
If an Australian accent tells you to get out of the water…   You get the heck out of the water!
Natural selection working ☕...
Natural selection at work 🤣 effing idiot
Farewell Blueman 🐊
Having a bath in Australia is a life threatening situation let alone swimming in open water on a small raft...🤣🤣🤣
Croc don't eat Tweenies, he knows that
Let natural selection take its course
I love how connected uk and Australia are when comes to speaking “Dont blame the croc when you get DONE by it “   😂😂 that’s too funny
2 minutes later "where did he go"....😅
No bullsharks ?
Probably an American 😅
Where’s the sign that says point the camera towards the deck of the boat?  I was waiting for a croc to eat a Smurf.
So Floridians do vacation!
*when arrogance gets you killed ✨️*
And what is he wearing??
They’re probably in Darwin.
Please don’t save the idiots. Never interfere with nature. This is the way.
Another Darwin Award nominee
Crocodile recently seen sign. F..k me.  Listen, the guy can do what he wants.  He's not swimming in the water. People swim in rivers where there are bulksharks with no attacks. That's in SA. So stop virtue signalling.
In Canada I see the same thing too with bear and moose. Park up on the side of the road and go in for a closer look, take a selfie. If locals are staying in their vehicles, you stay in your vehicles.
Let nature take its course...
Morons everywhere. Don't blame the croc when you get done by it 😅
He swims with alligators. He's not worried about your crocodiles.   That are twice the size and four times more aggressive. 😂😂😂
Is this the Darwin awards?
He's safe on his paddle board
I wouldn't even hop in a bath in Australia.
See If the man would just Allow nature to run it’s course the Human race would correct itself ... And those with commom sense will continue
If an Australian warns you about a dangerous animal, you should really probably listen.
Just sayin,  I'm a Croc expert,  I can wear them.  They don"t wear me. 🤣🤣🤣
Am American and I been there and these people are not lieing. Assie tell you that same thing is dangerous,  believe, and do what they say.
Ocean crocodiles...yet another reason no to live in Australia.
Some people’s children!   You tell someone something and it goes in one ear and out the other!
Just stay on fkkn Land,... ......no matter where you fkkn live.....!!?
Here in the States, many people would just nudge their friend with an elbow and whisper, "Hey, let's watch Smurf man get eaten ..."
Australians are the Earth's equivalent of America's florida man
Idiot are everywhere.
The “yer righto” was like a kid getting told to stop climbing on the roof of the house.😂
The paddle board guy sounds like a Brit Australian being nice trying to show him the errors of his ways and he gets mad and defensive like he knows best it’s a good example of when someone try’s to tell someone about Jesus Christ just to clarify I am against organized religion it’s man made and corrupt Jesus also was against religion that’s why they killed him
"I'm fully aware"  "Where's the sign?"
“I’m fully aware of it” really? Are you? you don’t seem like you are 😂
They did their best to warn him. So if he wants to be the next snack for old salty so be it.
that's "natural selection"
As dangerous as some of the local wildlife can be, you can guarantee it’s not gonna shoot back at you… can’t say that for other countries.
I'm from a different part of the world and I'd be smart enough to not be in the situation
lol
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it" 🤣🤣
And the Darwin Award goes to......Smurf on a shark biscuit.
Call a news crew so they can get the inevitable on film
There are some major eejits in the world. 🙄🙄🙈
For goodness sake dude, ask the locals before you go in their waters.... Where do you think you are?  The United Kingdom, where waters are safer? It's Australia!
The king crocs live up here and that guy is waiting to get rekt. There are thousands of them 😭🐊🏝️
I just don't understand why he's getting so mad at them being concerned about his safety😂😂
Freedumbass
Those blue man group guys are FEARLESS...👤💙
Would love an update on this absolute mad lad
Australians are crazier than Floridians. You’d think this 🤡 would listen to him.
Thinning the herd, let him be.
Those aren’t just crocs either, they sea crocs. This guy is choosing natural selection.
The guy was just trying to help. Let him stay in the food chain.
As a New Yorker all i can say to the dude talking! Shut The Effing Up and roll the camera you ruined the hole thing!
Foolhardy doesn't apply here, only FOOL is apt.
That would be me coming from Hobart the Coraner would have to look at the croc's poo.
Darwin Award Finalist potential.
Everybody knows crocodiles don't eat teletubbies.
Be he’s own fault, if he’s attacked and eaten alive 😡
And Mr paddle board wins the Darwin Award for 2024
Another entrant for the Darwin awards
This is how Australians uthenise themselves legally
And 2 crocks on his feet
Hmmmm.......a floating hors d'oeuvre for Mr Croc😋
How do you know he has chosen to be there for one purpose, a sad. Intentional, purpose.
Yummy paddling hands.....
Leave him to it…
Dude is going to argue whether or not a crocodile spotted was actually a crocodile. Meanwhile, he's dressed like a skinned seal floating around on a wafer.
Every 3 months a person is shredded to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland!
A big blue floating fish for Mr. Crocodile!  What a maroon.  We have a whole bunch of them here in California.   Not sure if I wouldn’t just make popcorn though and sit back and watch the show!  😳🫣😉
Crocodiles dont want to eat cheap blue
Just leave him be he's there to feed the crocodiles😮
Yo! Yo chill! Yo chill! 😂😂😂
he did not die, he only lost part of his left leg.
Natural selection at work.
We found the lost member of the Blue Man Group.
This fella with the camera is getting nature in the way..
Sum mothers do av em m8. Lol. Let him cop it. Mx😂😂😂🤦‍♀️
Our crocs are really big in Australia 🇦🇺
Dude must not be very smart.
“Darwin”ism 😝
FAFO
Maaaaaan....how could he have not seen the crocodiles too.  Let that man go in "piece" because he's about to be a 1 piece meal....  Just walk away.  There is no need to witness such stupidity.
😂😂😂
One there ⬆️ one there ⬅️and one over there ↗️
If I hear there’s a croc in the water in Australia, I’m staying out of my pool in Buffalo New York.
Would you rather listen to one minute of free advice and have a wonderful rest of your day or have punctuted lungs and severed limbs? Like why even have an attitude?
Mind ya business
I’m Australian. People need to learn how to mind their own business and not film people. Dude wants to take a risk that’s his choice.
If this guy in the blue suite doesnt hurry u and get out of that water the local crocodile community are going to have an early Christmas dinner
"Where's the sign?" You don't need a sign if you have any common sense.
What is wrong with that man
Introducing crocodile mile, with the amazing boomerang bump that sends you flying! With its giant splashdown pool, watch out for the croc!
if someone is warning you and they seem rude, its because theyre worried and the danger is REAL.
Crocs not to mention bull sharks n great whites box jelly fish dudes straight crazy 🤪 lol
That clueless man must be a yank. Typical of them
This guy is sadly not here anymore. He's made his way to smurfland. Rip little smurf.
Weee
Its the Blue Man Group vibe that does me in😂😂😂😂
A visiting friend from south africa once asked me if people weren't swimming because of the sharks and was confused to why there were no signs warning about sharattacks. I happily informed her that my local swedish beach has absolutely zero issues with sharks. Then I told her the temperature of the water and she said she'd rather swim with the great whites at home.
I wouldn't stand in a puddle up there ffs😂
Bro,I would say THANK YOU  and immediately go out from the water. This man is insane.
Incoming Darwin Award winner
This gives me chills
Don't blame the crocodiles? He won't. Half eaten people usually are very peaceful and don't go on blaming any living thing.
What a pillock.
😢 I just wonder what his appetite will be. I meant epitaph. Last scene
The locals know.
Hey honey, check that out - dinner's arrived. Come on, race ya.......................swooosh, chomp chomp.
Darwin awards
Do not feed the Crocs 😂
He calls that a boat!?
Nah. My entitlement would save me.
😂😂😂😂😂
prat
🤣🤣🤣
Common sense ain’t that common
Some people’s kids eh?! Lol
People just haaaate been told anything….
Dressed like that no suprise
God I love Australians 😂 that accent, you couldn’t be mad at someone talking to you like that lol
If he wants  to get eaten , let him.
Shoulda left him be once he started yapping back lol
"Yeah, righto."
is that a backpacker? visa hunter? let em be
Crazy!! and he's dressed like a seal
Mans just giving advice if dude don’t wanna hear that’s on him
He probably misunderstood the sign:     Crocodiles do not swim here
Let this idiot leave the gene pool
Fast food waiting for hime to paddle pas them😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So embarassing
Ever heard of natural attrition?
"Leave me to do my thing, you do yours" Brother...he's trying to save your life and save himself from seeing eaten by a croc
Whyte people, i would never argue with Steves cousin
Squidward escaped the bikini bottom cycle 😂😂😂
Guy is in a whole wet suit to be above water paddling like a dog 😂
Some people just are illiterate to the writing on the wall.
Queensland is wild. One day I went to the open air pool in Cairns and it was packed... surrounded by crocodile warning signs... 😬 I've never been so tense in my life.
Another nomination for a Darwin Award.
Have some common sense.  Yea right,  this is 2024 mate. When common sense is extremely uncommon due to mandatory genetic modifications.
I will never understand how people are not absolutely horrified of animals that can tear you to shreds in a matter of seconds. Their gameplan has existed far longer than we have existed as a species.
crocs on the f..........in jetty ffs!
WARNING: If Crocodile Dundee is concerned, then IMMEDIATELY STOP what you're doing.
Gotta be an American.
So did he get out then? Did he make it out in a panic? Did he get attacked and survive? Did he get attacked and not make it?.  Or were the crocodiles full that day or couldn't be bothered with taking  that blue wrapping off?
His headstone will read “hey guys, watch this”
Obviously tired of living. ☠️
The retardation is high with this one.
Bro, shut it. Free show
Idiot..
I’m not helping when he get attacked! I don’t help $+up!d
Idiot.
I lived in Darwin for a while, the croc's  are HUGE and absolutely terrifying.
And this is where he is a free meal. Listen when being told by the locals. Dont argue kevin.
As a Brit, I was staying with my friend in Australia, I asked her if it was OK to swim in the creek behind her house, to which she replied, "absolutely not, a bull shark lives there!!"  Only having tadpoles and maybe a perch in our rivers in the UK, I was very pleased I checked with her first!!
By crocky!
Leave every person to himself
Love that he's warning bout crocodiles while wearing them crocs
Son smarter than  father  apple 🍎  far from  🌳
You’re spoiling their afternoon snack 🥹🥹🥹
Croc bait lol❤
Imagine someone is trying to help you and you just have to be a petulant child about it. I just know the dude warning him brought the camera out after he had tried to warn him in a friendly way, and that lil Smurf got annoyed at someone trying to keep him alive.
Go to palm cove pier and watch how many sharks of all sorts they pull everyday. Last time i pulled hammerhead there
He must be American 😂😂😂
Yet more clear evidence that the gene pool is self-cleaning.
It’s an effin Aussie telling you it’s dangerous, if you don’t listen it’s natural selection at work.
Common sense is not common this is why most people get vaccinated
Bears in BC, send Australians for dinner
Trying to become Crock food He’s telling him  Should listen
You can't help everyone. You can't save everyone. Some people just don't want to be saved.🤦🏾‍♀️
Crocodiles do not debates you idiot. This man did not have to tell you about the warning signs. It is okay if you stay as the dumb idiots must be taken out by natural selection 😂.
What an idiot
remember evolution, let him go mate.
Hey let's go for a swim over by the crocs guys come on
Typical English man or those from the USA  silly man
It would have been a much easier to explain to him once a croc is latched on his leg.
“The Queensland harsh summer heat. Had me sweating buckets up and down my street”
Bro stop messing with natural selection 😂
I think the Aussie guy is being a little snappy 😎
“i’m fully aware of it” he says, “where’s the sign?” hes says later on.
I’m pretty sure he voted for Biden too 💯💩👎😂
Eh let nature take its course
How did that guy make it so long in life?
You’ll be questioned why , save my life”Mate”
white people get out of australia
Next episode ….. Man from blue man group is eaten by crocodiles in North Queensland .
same type of goon as the youtuber who got killed in the philippines. ignored the locals’ advice, finds out, and post-mortem nobody cares about u as a human being anymore. just a piece of idiot who’ll get their name dragged to filth online as another example of consequences.
Crocs also love boat ramps in Florida they’re all over black point marina
"Look mate I know crocs, I've got them on me feet."
He's colour blind, and he probably thought he had a green suit and planned to trick the crocs.
Ground beef in that stretchy plastic wrap
66 year old Ausie here with a lot of bush experience. You would not catch me anywhere near water in crocodile country. I know my limitations. Plenty of Downunder to buggerise around in without risking the smilie ones. I'll leave that to those who know what they are doing.
"but dont blame the crocodile when you get done in by it" never change australia, never change.
Any common sense for Palestine or you stand with white supremacy?
Dude's nuts, soon to be dinner.
As a new zealander who loved in north qld for ten years all i can say is the guy on the board clearly hasn’t spent any time in aus or believe me he wouldn’t go near the fkn water let alone on it lol
When you're in Australia and getting warning by an Australian...that's the time you really need to listen seriously
The dangerous places around the world are known now ..to everyone..if you get eaten or injured... that's on you.
Then when he’s eaten, the crocodile gets the bad reputation. These people I swear
Natural selection
Yeah I met an Australian there so awesome he's living in Los Altos somewhere but not his whole life mate
You told him nothing more u can do 🤷🏾
So... how about you film him getting snacked on instead of arguing with his stupidity.
🤪 crazy
This insane man would unironically seek out the dreaded drop bear.
bro doesnt listen to the bro, but once the girl says something he agrees? whats that logic.
My gosh North Queensland is so so dangerous this guy is an idiot if an Aussie says it’s bad it is BAD
Rules are written in blood, bro is denser than any existing solid.
Interestingly, Southern Australians can be completely oblivious to the very real dangers in Northern waterways. Knee deep brown water can hide a 12 foot (3.78546 meter) crocodile. A stern warning from a local should be considered a gift of concern.
Where is the part of the video where he gets eaten by a crocodile?
Darwinism at its finest
Every country has a certain number of d/a idiots.  Gotta appreciate the attitude - Go ahead, do what you want to do!.
You do your thing and I'll do aaahhh aaaaaahhhhhhh
Lived in Cairns there are So many Croc signs ! There was a croc in trinity beach in the net area!
This is exactly like pointing out facts to Democrat's 😂😅
As my Dad would say.... If your going to be dumb  You better be tough 😅
Tourists can be idiots
“Shh man SHHHH, let’s just see where this goes” -🐊
Crocs can't see him, he's wearing a blue suit. It's like an Australian green screen. He's fine.
There's two crocs in the video!
Dude Looks like one of the Blue Man Group paddling on a Volkswagen Beetle hood and sounds as dumb as a trailer ball
He was paddling in the shallow end of the gene pool ...
“Where’s the sign”
Yea no thanks I’ll stay on land
free food
No no no!!! .......Let nature take its course. Who are we to meddle with fate???  😂 😂😂    🏄‍♂️+🐊=💀
This is why I don't say nothing to anyone let them learn the hard way if they get ripped apart that on them can't tell anyone nothing they always take it the wrong way and get defensive
" Sir , You won't see it in the News because you'll be dead "
I aint dumb enough to go in the normal ocean let alone satans bathtub
Geeze
When dumb tourists feel entitled. 🤣
He slow
An Aussie literally saying teeth in the water and this roob not listening is a fine display of Darwinism.
We have similar issues up here on the Washington State Coast. We lose tourists and children every year to the riptide. (To anyone reading this: if you're ever swimming toward shore but getting farther away, the ocean is pulling you out. Just rest and float for a while until the land stops shrinking. Then swim parallel to the coast until you feel the water change. That's when it's safe to swim to shore, and the current will take you there. Think of riptides like a comb, the teeth pull you out to sea while the gaps take you back to shore.)  Edited because autocorrect really autofailed this time smh.
Well this is clearly an alligator biting my leg you never said anything about alligators
Darwin would be proud!
So proud to be an Aussie, best place in the world…. 🇦🇺👌
i wouldn't have said anything
Where's the sign? It's freakin Australia!
Part 2?
"Where is the sign?" - Procedes to show, not one but 3 signs. :surprisedpikachuface:
Wouldn't even catch me on the beach in Australia without a full suit of plate armor.
Blue Chewy Dinner again!!!! PLEASE 🙏,  Cover youself in BBQ Sauce so the Salty enjoys his meal!!! 😂😅😊
Nah, get that stupidity out of the genepool
I went to Africa once, and the tour guide said if I stop speaking and start running don't stand there and ask questions, about two hours into the tour, he stops speaking and stands still, he took a deep breath turned around and started walking the way we came, everyone but one lady stood there asking whats going on. she kept going forward and we heard a gun shot, the speed that man ran would impress the flash, a female cheetah was hunting, and apparently if you see them, they spotted you a while ago and just lets you get close to them. one thing I always do is never ask questions if someone says duck! I bend down.
From the sound and look of it that’s an aboriginal local telling him to not do this. When someone like that says be careful you be careful.
He'll be fine I hear Crocs don't like that murky green water.
I think hes an American Influencer doing a vid for tiktok
I wonder what happened
(sigh)...get your camera ready, i guess. Fish and Game guys will need to see it for their report.
What a clown
I respect this guy challenging this man, saltwater crocodiles are absolutely brutal and have no qualms whatsoever with ripping people off a paddleboard or kayak.  They are lightning fast, too 💯
He is free to become croc-food. Don’t stand in his way.
Chum
I love Australians arguing it sounds so Sophisticated
Did he die?
You just can't help some people.
Unbelievable, even I know that is dumb while living on the other side of the globe.
Sir can I have your car ? Chuck us the keys ? Cos you won’t be needing them anymore
I wonder how well a crocs digestive tract passes an entire human plus wetsuit and boots? He's gonna need some serious fiber to move that out.
Is he suicidal ?
Once again, this is croc country and wildlife don't read signs. No signs not mean no crocs
What an absolute nutcase. Sometimes all you can do is tell them. Unfortunately someone will have to clean the mess up and tell his family if nature has its way.
Once the woman joins in it’s over.
Darwinism in action.
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that half the butterflies in Australia are lethal. If one of the locals says there's something in the wild there that they themselves are afraid of and you ignore it, you've just taken FAFO to an exhilarating new dimension.
During my last trip to Queensland, a guy got eaten by a croc getting too close to the water. He was a local and if I remember he was an MD. This guy is in the water serving himself right up.
Bro tell him the truth but he still stubborn, wait until big dark shadow come up from below....
Now thats what I call crocodile bait
That's a future Darwin award winner there....😉👍
Just think this doughnut has a vote
Yee matey just wondering what kind of flowers yee want at ya funeral!??
The man is trying to help you.Get out of the water w that board.Think safety first ALWAYS
Let that food get eaten.
Always listen to the locals. Specially when they are Australian😅
bro would be at Jurassic Park doing the same if it existed.
The worst part about the video is- if you listen closely, the paddle boarder has an Australian accent indicating hes been in Australia long enough to know thr dangers of water plus unless hes dyslexic or something he should be able to read signs and know even by the pictures on said sign its a no go zone
Insanity
Dafaq is he wearing?
Did he ded
Welp uh if im being honest as a florida man this is uhhh we dont inow this man he belongs to some unknown origin and also you know if he got his behind chewed he…..he probably i dont think it would matter anymore if he tried to blame the croc ? Ion know maybe he just trying to see what it feels like ion know but florida dont have answers guys im sorry this man isn’t related to us .
This is just natural selection at work..kick back and enjoy the show..😎
Darwin says hello 😂
Hahahaha...
I'm not sure if that's the ocean or not but if so he should probably work Worry about the bull, tiger and great white sharks that would love the free lunch. 😅
There is no way I would ever ignore an Australian of all people if I am being warned to move away from something.
At least he is jellyfish save.
Let him argue all he wants, but I doubt the crocodiles are gonna care about what he has to say. 😂
"Im fully aware" also same guy "where's the sign?" Zombie apocalyps is real!
Why is he paddling with his hands?
Blue noid on a surfboid
I think he should have kept filming. Eventually he'd end up with an epic viral video.
He’s got his feet out of the water he will be ok
Nah bro'  just leave him alone let him do his thing... and let nature do her thing...😂😅
I don't think he will blame anything after getting grabbed.
Squilliam
Sometimes you just feel like letting natural selection take place 🙄
When you get done by it.....
Hate to admit it but hes probably from Los Angeles,
Just let them be
The waves are not very good in North Queensland. He'll be waiting for quite sometime. 😂
Whats the sign??? 😂😂😂
There was probably a crocodile 🐊 stalking him aswell.
If a local tells me what I'm doing is dangerous because of local wildlife, I take their word for it.  Crocodiles don't read signs and my understanding is that they aren't very selective about what they attack.
Let natrual selection do it's thing bro.
The 2024 North Queensland Darwin Award goes to...
Where’s the “why the whites wonder?” guy?😂
Don't you tell me not to want to die!
As an Australian Swimming in Australia is a no go 😂😂  The world thinks our spiders and snakes are bad, but what’s really bad are the sheer amount of crocs…
I use to swim in the ocean next to the croc river In north Queenstown and i will tell you there is a lot of crocs. I would swim where i could escape if i saw a croc and i always have my eyes out to see one. My house was on the beach and had crocs in yard sometimes.
Bro stop saying "Crocodile infested " they live there 😂😂😂.
Let natural selection take its course
One thing is for certain, the world will never run out of Idiots
Darwin was right
Reminds me of the time in the Congo we told the 23 year old Girl not to go out Jogging 🏃 alone , When we finally found Her she was literally scattered over a 60 mt  area being fought over by Lions and hyenas, We collected what we could of Her but it wasn’t much ….😢
Natural selection, shouldn’t have said a word
What an absolute berk. You know that his family will be blaming the crocodile if he gets eaten, even though he's going around in the water like a floating dinner gong.....
Not sure why this guy stepped in. This is a great example of Darwinism, film it and sell it to a university for study.
Leave him be, he's about to strengthen the gene pool.
When zombies get attacked the first thing they want to do is blame animals blame others instead of blaming themselves if you know of zombies get them to help they need
Dudes like  Leave me be. I want to be a snack.
Guess he doesn’t want to be saved 😅
Natural selection.......
Tell him the dangers, and let them do his thing, atleast you have told him
so... what happened next...?
It's called natural selection 😂😂😅
No one wants to believe there's a man eater until you're on the one getting eaten
salt water crocodiles can grow up to 24 feet long and weigh over 2,000 pounds.
This guy sounds like his mum "Don't come running to me when the crocodile bites your legs off"  Love it!
Let Darwinism do its job.
Funneee fukka!🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🫣
tourists need to listen to locals. Routburn Nz.  just wise up
funniest comments section I’ve read in a while.
All I want is an update. How did this day end up? 😅
As an American, I can tell you. Nothing infuriating to us more. Than someone telling us that we’re doing wrong. It goes against the very fiber of our existence. Drifting into your lane and so you honk at us? War!
Leave those judgemental people behind, man!   Come to the States.  We have a whole park full of Buffalo you can pet!
So, 😊did this guy survive? This is death drive, essentially.
This clip could have the title: Preachy dude acts wise
... but their brains are missing, right? :))   PS - Just because some entitled, preachy dude is trying to assert his superiority, it doesnt; mean his heart is in the right place
If the dude wants to be part of a Lacoste sign then let him be happy
Who cares !  Just make sure your camera is running
Fafo
Ignorant, the same guy who would speed up on left lane and slow down in right, the same guy who would still drive at 100 on 80  Completely ignorant
Future Darwin award winner right there count on it. 👀😂
This guy thinks crocs are shoes
There’s no sharks in here.  Na mate……..crocodiles ‘et all the sharks .
Dont blame the crock for hanging out, waiting for fish... including the blue paddlefish...😮  Listen to the Aussie locals and live. 😊
Fool!
I wonder what happened to him. Did he get out safely or was he a crocs din din? 😅
Thats the side effects of the .....well never mind.
Darwin was right… let him be right again. Circle of life…
Just let nature sort its self out
The take away is idiocy is unanimous of all cultures, code, race, demographic, etc.
Show me the crocodile now.
"Wheres the sign??".... This dude wants to see a sign telling him swimming with silent dinosaur assasins is a poor life choice.
Man there's big crocodiles up there, they could easily knock him off that paddle board, but he doesn't want to listen, he's been warned.
This is like coming to Florida and just jumping in any dark water. I don’t recommend it.
Unhealthy skepticism
Trying his best for a Darwin award
I traveled in Oz for two and a half months and never got into the ocean once!! 🇬🇧
This is staged ....
Blame the wild animal when they themselves offer their body as offering
I mean, at one Point it just comes down to survival of the fittest ya know? At least you tried
Leftist , I guarantee it
You've done your part. Now, let natural selection take over.
Another Darwin Award finalist.
You ever seen a dum drongo run on water!??...keep this up mate the whole world would witness one and on YouTube at that!...Listen to the Ozzie mate...i would if i was you
I get the feeling the bloke doesn't much care if the smurf gets himself deleted, he's more worried the crocs will get a bad rep.
Darwin Award winner.. stop saving them!
Queenslanders, always in the water, if they’re not in the water then Get Out Of The Water!!
Mind your own business, I'm not afraid of no stinking crocodile. LOL.
With such bad judgment, how has this man survived this long? Whoa!
Maybe he wanted to give him some advise. But why be so aggressive? Be so aggressive and angry? Unless it was his daft gramps?😠 Like 'hey man do you know theres crocs there'? In Africa unless you never wanted to cross the rivers, you had to use a boat, but only hippos were big enough to be 😳 dangerous. And even then you were ok if you jumped onto the upturned boat.😅
Stupidity personified
For fish and thick people!
Survival of the fittest have your way!
You get bitten by a shark, you just get taken by a croc.
Let natural selection take it course..😂😂
Aussie's are southern Florida people if they say no just trust it.
The worst thing you can do to a man is to leave him to his stupidity...
And the Next Darwin award goes too....
Its alright, he has a stinger suit on 😂
They should be charged with endangering children
"where's the signs?" Buddy, local people in boats know more about the local waters than the government's signage department
Tourist, right!
Get the police officer on him for breaking our law 😤
Rude, considering they're potentially saving his life.
I’ve never seen someone question an Australian about what is the craziest
Must be an American
I can atest to there being crocs in the River in Cairns. I was in Cairns last year and I could see them from the bridge. I would not go near the water especially if there is a Croc sign.
Let that man live his life if her wanna swim with the crocs let party lol😂 He wasn't bothering nobody
He tried being nice, but perhaps natural selection is in order 🤣.
People shouldn't interfere with natural selection
Don’t even live anywhere near there, but when there’s been crocodiles sightings like that and jumping on the water, that’s crazy
What good is a knee board?  That whole scene was confusing. His crazy outfit on a tiny piece of foam. Croc bait!
😂
Idiot. Darwinism at work.
Darwin Had a Theory This one is Determined to Prove it!
There’s no helping some people
Well the sign did say: Crocodiles Don't Swim Here.
I love his accent so much. And the kindness but stern way he says it 😊
... has his little rash suit on ... hood up ... gotta watch for the dangerous UV radiation ... so thought obviously  went into the prep for his water activity ...  Just one minor oversight though ...  The fekkin saltwater croc infestation 😊 ...
"Where's the sign?" He needs a sign to know he's in Australia?
A hundred dollars says he’s a boomer with self entitlement
It is a lack of common sense absolutely.
Natural selection....G'day mate.....
Personally I'd call the cops it's idiots like this that cost tax payers millions every year for their rescue & health treatment, that's if their families aren't paying for their funerals.
Need to move ta North Queensland where they have common sense,  out of it here in the states..😅
Natural Selection aaaalmost 🤏  happening.  Sorry, Charlie (Darwin, that is, not Charlie The Tuna 😆).
Such a wonderful concept, common sense,..!😂
Cares enough to wear a stinger suit but not enough to avoid the crocodile water 😂
Blue boy must be from the USA.😂
Leave the people alone please 🙏 we have an over population problem. Kindly let nature take care of it.
Did he get taken?
Dudes voice itself sounds dummb af
Old entitled dude was hoping to become dinner to a Croc and you messed with his plan. 😂😂😢
Let nature take its course mate , its called natural selection 👍🏼
Some people are just too arrogant to have common sense. You did your best, mate, now the rest is on him!!!!
Another imminent Darwin Award winner.
Crocs in Florida are not aggressive 😂   “No, crocodiles in Florida are not generally aggressive towards humans:  Temperament American crocodiles are shy and reclusive, and conflicts with humans are rare.  Behavior When surprised, crocodiles will quickly and noisily enter the water. This behavior indicates that they are frightened, but it shouldn't be mistaken for aggression.  History There have been few documented attacks on humans by crocodiles in Florida. In 2014, a crocodile bit a man and woman in a canal in Coral Gables, but it released them and moved away. “
Lol
My father was the same way. Never listened to a word I said !!!
He wants to believe reality is subjective, let the consequences teach him otherwise...
Camera man is wearing crocs while also warning others about crocs. Goated 🐐.
Crocodile Shmokadile 🐊.......it's North Queensland! It's probably 38° C and he's got a wetsuit on!? Crocs love warm meat 🍖 😍
Darwin Awards will read "Death by Croc"...
I smell a Darwin Award.
That man in blue, either he has a death wish, or just being one f*cking st*pid
That's a big dumb fish then😂
Crocodiles don‘t eat intelligent people…
Well, I guess even the Australians have their Florida man
Can we have an update please 😂?
Please. I beg people. STOP WARNING DUMB PEOPLE for common sense things. Just film the live action😂
Put your DL number on your board. Croc’s don’t eat that !   So when your eaten we can ID you for next of kin.
Anybody notice he is wearing Crocs while warning about the Crocs?
My advice would be to trust the locals when they warn you of some hazards that will cost you your life⚠️😲🤔😳
And the Darwin Award goes to........
cant use logic when talking to idiots, shouldve said there were alien sightings nearby he would run for his tin foil
What a good dude. Hahahaha. Hes just helping you old bloke!
Did he died!?
These are the people who end up in the newspaper as a statistic.
Is that filthy frank?
Bet the a**holes taste better.
Seen same thing down here in Cardwell some people just have no brains 🦈
Wheres the sign ? Who cares about the sign your in north Queensland
The only thing i can think of, is he and his wife hsve been fighting on the whole trip! He cant take it anymore, so he called it! Vacation is over. Your going home alone, where is my snowboard?
Don't call it the Darwin award for nothing
If a local warns you of something in the water, 100000% listen to them.
😂 they have crocodile signs up everywhere.  This idiot thinks he will  be ok! Im on vacation, im from New york, crocodile will give me a pass. He wouldn't ruin my vacation. There he goes, him and his snowboard. 😮 amazing the low I.Q., someone reported he had a Biden bumper sticker on his snowboard.
That's not a crocodile. This is a crocodile. 😊
Expecting animals to be woke 😂
He ends up on the menu, then they shoot the crocodile! Amazing
Your from New york arguing with a guy with a aussie accent where to swim! In Australia! Your a idiot! You deserve to be on the menu!
But did he die? No. So move along Buck-O.
This is insane, if you get into the water in Australia or south Africa, you deserve to be gater food; you are asking to be a snack! Just swim in the hotel pool, bring your snowboard with you!
Ken not too bright.
Did the blue guy get eaten? I can’t imagine him getting out of that water alive.
THE DARWIN AWARD! Awarded in Darwin every year! This year’s winner: Stubby!
Honestly us men just wanna die sometimes. It’s why we put ourselves in these situations, he’ll be fine
If you are in the top half of Australia don't swim in the water ways unless you have really good visibility. (F#@&ing clear water)  Or it's signed to be safe. If you want to be scared of puddles search croc/ crocodile hiding in puddle.
He really should be more careful.. sheesh .. Just from the video I can see two Crocs 🐊!!!!!! Lord knows how many more are near…
F that. Do what you want. That guy is just trying to keep this, clearly, super awesome swimming spot just to himself!! 😊
Nice video of the dock. Smh
If an Australian is telling to something is dangerous. Listen.
Darwinism at its best, survival of the fittest. Yum,  says the Salty.
If he wants tl get bit my a crlc thats on him🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾🤦🏾 clmmon sense aint so common anymore
I would so not be in that water even if I looked cool, let alone being death rolled by a crock in my blue tights and wakeboard.
Never interfere during a potential Darwin award.
Just let Darwin take over
I love the sentence "Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it" 100% The animals just do what they were put on this earth to do and what their instincts tell them to do. We are the invasive species.
Right O
You can’t talk sense to some people…
Crocs have to eat too.
Listen to the man warning you about crocs. Hes got two of them on his feet.
You couldn't get me in ANY body of water in Australia. Nope !
Im guessing that is a dumb liberal American
You can offer advice and help, but if they don't want any it's time to pull out a seat and enjoy the show
Dont worry its probably tortured toony and hes safe bc hes high af
It's already had half his board  didn't he notice?😂
Natural selection at its finest. 😂
Darwin award!
The low IQ Darwin Award contestants just keep on coming...
Proof there is no limit to stupidity
I think this guy wants to go out like that so. There's nothing you can do to stop them. Crocodiles need easy food.
A German girl got killed by a crocodile a few years ago. I felt so sorry for her family.  She was from Starnberg in Bavaria  and used to swim in the lake at home. Thank goodness we don't have crocs here !
Signs, signs everywhere signs. “EFFIN” up the scenery…
It's like watching a fella casually walking across the freeway and have him argue with you because you say it may be dangerous. How did this man make it to his present age? Luck? Miracle? Fate?
Darwin 😂😂😂
Getting mad at someone for trying to save your life is wild 😂
Let the crocs have an early Christmas dinner party
Subscribing for part 2...
Egeeit
I think you’re a good people. We’re trying to tell him, but if he wants to get eaten by the crocodiles, then so be it they got to eat too.
No ex horse thief has common sense.  Mate.
He’s a candidate for Natural selection I think it’s only right we let nature take its coarse 🐊
Why is he dressed like a smurf
Let the dumb feed himself to the croc…! He will go down in history as another statistic of food chain evolution.
"where's the sign at" is the least Australian thing I've ever heard said down under. The crocs don't care about signs the signs get put up when fools like you don't listen to the locals and become statistics
A very amazing surgeon from Seattle fixed my leg up after a bad motorcycle accident. He was a top level traumatologist at harborview medical center.   I heard since then that he went to Africa to help the locals and while canoeing, a large crock grabbed his arm, yanked him overboard and that was it.... What a way to go.  RIP
We have the same problem explaining how leopards eat faces to MAGA.
If a Local in Aus is telling you you're a fukcing Idiot. You truly are a fukcing idiot lol
I wouldn't even take a shower in Australia.
part 2 man on paddleboard is missing
I guess there's always a dumb tourist somewhere. I remember when I was a kid living in the Northern Territory (North Australia), a tourist was literally warned by locals not to fish from the bank because there was a croc not too far away. Croc went under water, tourist misjudged the speed of the croc & tourist literally lost his head. All over the news.
He is safe as long as the crocs get the personal pronouns correct, carry on
Good job mate, you did what you had to do and congratulations for it hopefully they made it home.  But I'd rather see mother nature take its course and we were cul the herd of these idiots.
I am surprised that this OZ man was so nice to the smurf ; That's not the Australia I know.
Natural selection.
Hey that's where my ex-sister-in-law is from. Wonder if she'd like to go take a swim there
North Australia is insane. I wouldn't be going in any water over there.
only thing that would ahve made it better if this was in darwin instead of north queensland
😵‍💫
A man angry that he’s now scared and trying to act like he’s not whilst still getting out of the water
The blue man group trying to stay relevant
Arguing with locals ... like they don't know better.
Yup I'd definitely listen to the aussie
Oh gawd was that a kiwi
He rather be swallowed whole  then swallow his dumb pride. yikes.
Australians gave up their guns and were told they shouldn't do that. Australians love to scold one another, and Australians love to not listen. This is a video of irony!
Doing a kneeling paddle board in croc infested water. What could possibly go wrong?
Is this where the crocodiles get fed?
I think I saw one of the crocs holding a menu 😂
Never disturb the beautiful process of natural selection
Evolution at work.
Hope they called the police
Stop coddling. Let people do what they do and nature will bring balance. Let them swim with crocs. Let them pet the bison. Let them take selfies with a moose. Let them find out fire is hot. Coddling is how we got so weak.
Wow, there is always one idiot!
he should know, but you were just trying to help him.  dont need to prove a point or argue.  give him the info and move on.
Proof people would rather die than be told to do something by another person.
Pommy cant
Natural Selection about to take place…
He looks like such a tool
Just keep filming
This guy is looking to get the Darwin award!
I can’t f read the subtitles, because a search bar is there.
Dude must be from Florida.
Wouldn't have said a word. Let naturall selection take its course. Too many idiots like this prime example
Darwinism 😂
This man actually cares about sir! Apperently more than you care for yourself 😅
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by” is my new catchphrase.
I say let nature take its course
This Australian is very American
He's embarrassed at several people calling ĥìm out on his stupidity.
Where's the sign?😅 Sometimes, you just got let stupidity run its course😊
Can that female in the background just shut up, she sounds so annoying.
Let Darwinism run its course.
Natural selection 😂
what is that outfit hes wearing ?
his haircut says it all, broccoli haired low IQ tool
Darwin awards has entered the chat.
Paddle boards and kayaks are no protection from the creatures of the deep. Tempt fate enough and you will meet your maker.
"The crocs love the boat ramp, they hang around waiting fish" let's not forget the paddle boarders too & anything that moves 😂
Lol, don’t flatter yourself, buddy. I’m not worried about what you’re doing. Just try not to die in front of me.
Sometimes you just have to leave some folks to their fate and let Darwinism do its thing
What is he wearing and what is he doing 😂
Idiot man. Don’t be out in known crocodile areas. Exactly, in Nth QLD is known crocodile habitats. There is a map on google of crocodile territory.
I don't think I've ever seen an Australian concerned about wildlife. That's terrifying lol
"Where's the sign?" Dude, you're in a known croc region. You don't need a sign to tell you what to do. 🤦‍♀️ This is the same person who would stroll over a busy road, get clipped by a car, and then say there was nothing telling him to wait for the little green man.
That guy on the boat..tut tut ruthless..How'd you feel if your meal was coming and some1 stopped it 😂😂
Gen Z😂
This is crazy work 😳
He think it’s fun and games until.
What a idiot  listen to locals😂😂
If a Aussie say it’s dangerous LEAVE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗣️🗣️😊
He doesn’t want the crocs to get a bad rap for doing what crocs do while this guy is just oblivious to what he’s doing
Natural selection will take care of the situation 😂
Even crocs have to eat!
That dude on the paddle board is an idiot. Lord looks after fools and drunks as they say.  ❤️💜💚
And after 2 people warn him of imminent death  he says "oh yeah right". 😮
Hey, just let nature take its course.
This doesn't only go for Australia tbh. If a local tells you not to do something, don't effing do it 😂
White sharks, salties, tiger sharks ,box jellyfishes, sea snakes -and so on …. This must be a Russian guy 😂
This sums up MANKIND!
That reminds me of my new song swimming with the crocodiles
He look like a right twit out there .
Don’t tell him, let him not live his best life
But it's the first time his done that, and the last.
He wants to die!
"Sir, you better stay away from the water." "Nah! I it's all right. I can ha..#&#!ßßgggrrrrrrrrrllllll......."
Let him go
I watched black water
Thanks for letting this man know, you are very kind.❤
Gotta let darwin do his job
Listen to your mate, mate
There's a phrase "only mad dogs and English men........" when I see things like this I always question if the phrase should be about the English or not.  I mean, I know we are responsible for you being there, but honestly, seeing some of the crazy I want to pretend we never went south?
Thats absolutely wild !, he’s trying to inform him that he’s on a poxy little paddle board in crocodile infested waters and he’s getting upset at him stopping him “enjoying” his paddle .. wake up you fool and heed the warning signs, the man is trying to make you aware of the surroundings you’re in that you’ve stupidly chose to ignore 😬🙈
I might stick some faux buttons n switches on the face of my Epi Valve Junior. Looks gorgeous.
Brain surrounded by a brick wall. You cannot get through to them.  Ex wife was the same.
Did he get eaten
The intelligence spectrum of the human race really is something to behold.
I love how the man is much more concerned for the safety of the crocodile than the man on the knee boat lol
Absolute stupidity.. well done to the bloke offering advice!
I'm from England and the only water you'd get me in in The Northern Territories and Northern Queensland is a BATH!!!•😂
Does anyone know if this floating food platter won the latest Darwin Awards?
Morons everywhere. What a tool.
Even a gator would run from a salty.
After some stories I’ve heard about how patient and cunning those salt water crocs are when they set their sights on prey I would be very very afraid 😵
Leave the guy alone
"your in north Queensland mate, have some common sense." People from elsewhere don't have this knowledge. It should be taught in schools Australia wide about safety in Australia because there are many who don't know much
Dont think for a second they're protecting you, mate. In my experience, nothing makes an Aussie madder than an animal being relocated or killed because of the stupidity of humans.
Is he still alive?
Crocodiles like Blue Fin Idiot, too
Beautiful water, but I’m not swimming in anything that has crocodiles or alligators or anything like that
DARWIN do your thing!!!
He is an ignorant idiot. Just let nature take its course.
My question is how has someone that devoid of common sense lived to that age?
what  are you doing
Gotta be a better wy to commit suicide....
Ah, natural selection at its finest.
Tbe Darwin theory of evolution will catch up with this Farkwit.
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it😂
If he's mentally stable, the outcome is on him.
Just let Nature do its thing
What was he even doing ffs
Whats with the Beavis suit
It's like when parents leave their toddler unattended by a lake on disney property in FLORIDA and their kid gets eaten by a gator. There are signs everywhere in fl that says there are GATORS in bodies of water. Then sue disney for their childs death when they SHOULD HAVE KEPT THEIR CHILD WITH THEM
He complains there’s no signs, dude points out 3 different signs and he just moves on to the next excuse. No point in trying to be rational with irrational people.
So did he get eaten
Oh no, the Aussies are worried about what you're doing. It means you're INSANE
Darwin Award nominee??😅
This man is clearly a Floridian in Australia.  You mean Swamp Puppy right?
Hey man, we’re never gonna get rid of these Darwin awards if you keep warning people.
You would have to pay me SERIOUS money to dip my toe in that water, and I live in Australia.
Please don't take the camera off him, we all want to see!
See, stand back and let Darwin do his job. This is why we have so many dumb people.
"the bloke on the dock is fk'n with you, mate. Water is fine"- a croc
Love to talk to you like this when you come to our country
just leave him
Every Australian has told me the most dangerous thing you can do is get in the fkin water there
When an Aussie tells you not to go out in crocodile infested water, you should listen. Because he will risk his life to save you when you’re being attacked. Fun facts mate. So, don’t be a deuce bag.
The first part of the interaction seems to be missing, so can't get a true sense of exactly how that transpired, but lets just remember that sometimes also that when someone acknowledges something and wants to do it anyway it is their own risk  they dont need to be lectured for ages about it, the guy clearly didn't care for his safety and thats on him, he was told, the end!
Ahhhh mate it’s Nth Q not your pool haha
Crocodile food from a cocky fool
humans have to be the dumbest animals on the earth, that’s why for 400 thousand years they never exceeded more than a few hundred million, now when modern humans like this human bait fish will argue that he has a right to paddle around in waters that are known to have predators lurking around them you just wave and say have a nice day who cares
" but dont call the crocodile a CAAnTTTTTTTT  when you get done by it"
He sounds British.
Dude never swim in Cairns .. that dude is crazy 😅
Only crocks I see is the one he is wearing 😅
The blue onesie has thrown me. Where's this gentleman from? I can't hear him answer.   As an Australian, I think we can be a bit too subtle with warnings sometimes. This wasn't one of those times 😂
Darwin evolution at work right here.
I saw two crocs in this video
I'm sure you made him feel like you really cared while rerecording him. lol
Darwinism at its finest…
I love the aussie ending… “yea righto” 😂
I guess he was going anti-crocwise. 😂
Well this is a FAFO SITUATION
Eh, you did your part. I just feel bad for the rescue team who will have to put themselves in harms way because someone didn’t want to listen to a life and death warning.
People today that WILLING TO ARGUE ANY POINT 👉 EVEN WHEN THEIR LIFE IS AT RISK AND THEY ARE IN THE WRONG... this bloke wouldn't last a day on my channel THE SURVIVOR RANCH 👋💀👍🤪
Soo, what happened? Wish the video was longer. 😈
Natural selection 😂
Was born and raised in Cairns. Alwyas tied the dog up between the water and my swag. Stay safe people, crocs dont care.
Far North Queensland has signs everywhere about Salties and the very real danger they present.
Yeah right oo
🙄 There’s a point where you just ask “would you like fries with that?”
So North Queensland is basically the armpit of Florida. Our swamps are in the armpit and they’re filled with alligators. People still think it’s safe to walk their pets near the water even tho they can’t see more than 6 centimeters in. Oh it’s fine I’ve lived here for 6 months and nothing has happened yet. Yeah, that’s because it’s still getting used to your northern smell
If an Australian told me"hey mate get outta the wattah*  best believe I'm getting out .
Even I would not go in the water when I was there.
Natural selection 😊
Wouldn't have said anything...  Just keep filming
Ya where the signs?😂😅😊lol
Good on the guy warning the idiot that won’t be told
A real contender for a Darwin award. These entitled idiots think they know everything, just like the woman who got out of her car to get a better photo of a lion whilst driving through a lion enclosure only to be severely mauled by a lion she didn't see.
Ah lunch is served 😂🐊
The Australian version of petting a bison at Yellowstone.  😂❤
Crocs don't wear signs😅
Fully protected from sunburn tho.
It’s crazy natural selection hasn’t gotten that guy in his many years.
That's a really big blue fish right there!!!😂😂😂❤❤❤
I grew up with alligators. But absolutely f*** a crocodile.
Where's the Signs 😂😂😂
Who cares?
Why do some folks think the signs (and rules)  dont apply to them?
I think there is no common sense there
That's the same guy that leaves the car at a safari to pet the lion cubs
"I'm fully aware. .....Where's tbe sign?" So youre NOT fully aware
Darwin Award.
Aussie guy is not only bothered about this crazy but also , it will be too dangerous when crocodiles become man eater and they will get used to it around that area , which will lead to others also danger in future .
The old guy would rather risk being eaten by a crocodile than risk his ego being damaged. 😂😂😂
Sometimes you should just let natural selection take it's course 😂
He's German guy in the water, I think. Hence the arrogance.
Natural selection.
One of my worst fear. Drowning + at the same time getting shredded by crocodiles.
DARWIN will win in the long run.
Joe biden on vacation?
Natural Selection, let him be! Bahhahahaahaa
I had a German tourist ask me if it’s safe to swim in Australia. I told him not at sunset where he was pointing.. it was tiger shark feeding water off a point. He decided to swim anyway and they found pieces of his wetsuit in a big tiger sharks stomach later that week. Sad
A  Salties  Christmas  Turkey.  😊
Wow words fail 😮 you have done your best to advise him thank you for that but yet again words fail his response is mind boggling .
Dumb see you NT in QLD 😂
Ther only signs?...what?...he for real?.??
Australia contains more poisonous living things than anywhere else in the world. When a local gives you safety advice, you’re an idiot to ignore it!  They’ve probably been surfing, swimming, camping, hiking around that area from the age of 3-4!
When locals give you the low down, and you want to argue back, he was obvs on a suicide mission!!
It's basically a cyclist on water, just loves to be in harms way🙄
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it😂
“Do what you wanna do” will put the people who will have to help him at risk. So I disagree with that approach. 😮
Natural selection at its finest 🤣
Film it right or don't Film at all
Let natural selection do its job.  You tried, mate.
I think one of our cyclists got lost sorry Australia xD
If he won't listen he must feel
If an Aussie advises me not to do something crazy. I’m listening bc they are already crazy AF.
Darwin Award. Make him stay out paddling
If I see a warning sign I’m going to respect it and listen. Some people sign their own death certificate sadly…
He says as he is paddle boarding himself. Total gronk ya can tell
You can't help some people they will blame everything except themselves
Croc missed out on supper 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Just a Paddling  " Snack "  MMMMMMMM
Idiot.  The one in blue LoL 🤣😆🥸
These people vibrate to the same frequency as my ex 🤣 Zero awareness ⚠️☠️⚰️🤦🏻‍♂️
He wants to be croc food. You warned him so leave him be. Show authorities this video when the odd body part floats to shore and let them know, he wanted to be eaten
Natural selection at work
Did that person listen or ignored the warnings.
What a crank
Is that my boy @wildmanadventures talking sense?
Leave old dude alone he clearly has finally had enough of his wife and is looking for an easy way out!
What's wrong with these people on youtube . Your such a gent i would have lost my cool with him
Imagine him taken right there on camera all over in in .010 of a second
well, we get a nice view of buddy's feet while we listen to him  'Karen' at someone.... that's somethin'
The man was wearing crocs too
Natural Selection.
That’s why they have a town there named Darwin. 🏆🎖️
As a Floridian this is relatable it’s literally like Do you need a sign? If it’s a body of water, there are alligators in it.
there is no such thing as common sense.
You were WAY TO NICE to him !  Ya gotta yell loudly at !diot to get the ef out !!!
I really want episode 2 of this drama
Man’s right! Look at his feet, the crocs are already on ‘im!
The hell's he even doing paddling around on a knee board dressed like a Smurf
How can you not blame someone for trying to eat you?!?
The guy on the board, whats his accent? American here, they all sound Australian to me.
When he’s playing uno with the lord, they’ll have a good laugh.
“yeah righto”… do i detect a bit of sarcasm mate? she aint loiyin!!
Saltwater crocs are absolutely brutal too. American gators are housecats in comparison.
Just let natural selection run its course
Natural selection at it's craziest 😂😂😂!!!
Fk me days what is wrong with people I’m in NZ and even I know about crocs,bull sharks, snakes just general Australia wildlife to be careful of and to stay away from
what an idiot, he probably lives in the belly of a croc by now
You call that a knife?    Now that's a knife!
Legend has it Darwin met this dude in Australia trip and screamed, "Finally!!! theory of evolution"🗿🗿🗿
Weeell , you tried mate😂😂😢😮.
I f a white guy with that accent is telling you it’s dangerous….
Idiot
If the locals warns you plss listen
“But don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it” love aussies perfect line 😆🙌❤️
idiot
NPC confirmed!
Natural selection mate
Croc's are also hungry let them eattttt.  Blue cheese.
The same happened  to me too, lol. I was fishing a lure gut stuck and i jumed in to get it. But at least i got out when the aussie guy came and thanked him
Future Darwin Award winner.
Dummheit findet seine Strafe.
Natural selection right there 😅 Lets stop feeling sorry for the victims of croc attacks from now on
But he's got a stinger suit on!! Safe from at least one predator.
Natural selection...
I would get out of a swimming pool if someone with an Australian accent was warning me about possible crocodiles in the water.
Some people just took the signs for “no swimming in crocodile infested water” as “feeding the crocodiles at your own risk” 😂
I can’t believe people sometimes coming from growing up in Northern Natal South Africa where the rivers, swamps and lakes are infested with man eating Nile Crocodiles and there are warning signs in areas just like in this video “Do not Swim / Beware of Crocodiles” but still we get idiots like in this video who seem to think the laws of being eaten by man eating Salt water crocs don’t apply so yes let him be you have warned him enough and when he is eaten “His family must not come crying  saying what happened”
What a fool!
😂 north Queensland and common sense in the same sentence just doesn't sound right
What a spanka, As an Aussie I’d be giving directions to a perfect river to float down in NT east alligator river Cahills crossing great swimming spot there’s also a chance for great knee boarding activities
I was in port douglas and lassoed a post out in the river then lassoed it again and tied to back of wrangler jeep. Walking out above the shaded water on the rooe I tried to get my cast net which had sunk and got caught on something. For ten bucks I risked my life. Croc could have been under there and had me.
Stupidly is free
Natural selection is engaged.
People gotta just start letting survival of the fittest take effect
Darwin was right!! 😂😂😂
He actually started wrong by saying "have some common sense"
Where is the next part?
Not to mention the 15 to 20 foot great whites. Darwin always wins. Its a fact if not for money alot of gene's would be gone out the pool.
Natural selection at it’s finest
If they dont want to believe you, let them! You did what you can! Let them. And wait……
Probably a democrat.
Soon as ii heard the accent I knew he shouldn't be in that water. Besides the crocs there is poisonous everything.
This video, the commentary and the comments are just something ooooo
Shut up and let nature do its part. These morons shouldn't procreate
Australians are very, very laid back, and usually very understated. If an Aussie is yelling at you, listen!
Clearly the Aussie is interrupting a suicide
Dude got to be an American!
Tourists, or not a new Aussie
Oh man, they were worried for this idiot and yet he got mad and still acted like an idiot. I hope he listened to the warning.
Tourists in Florida too. If there's more than a teacup of water and its inland, just dont go in ok 🤷‍♀️
He’s like that one guy who goes out in the Florida Everglades at night, barefoot, and grabs every non gator animal out there.
Please why do you people feel the need to film everything and post to the internet?
When cyclists go on holiday!
How much you want to bet that that guy is from Florida!😜
There's many a people that don't know what common sense is these days, j/s
Why is he in a blue man group hooded suit on a wee board w hands splashing asking where is the sign ( there are 3)   in a place called Darwin.  Glol.   Daft much ?   The Arrogance...the Ignorance.   Wtaf
Leave him alone mind your own business
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Ozzy! get the heck out of there.
Crocs love arrogant.
A.I.
If an aussie says your in danger... scream and run. No questions asked. They don't gaf about being in danger unless being unalived is immenent.
When an Aussie gives you outdoor advice you take it. 😂 Especially on their turf.
Hey man can’t save them all!
Just let him be, natural selection at its finest.
Darwin Award candidate!🙄
Natural selection
Yeah righto
He fears no crocodile, shark, spider or man...except Gargamel😂
*DON'T WARN HIM, HE DOESN'T CARE & HE THINKS HE'S SMARTER, LET HIM FIGURE IT OUT*
Geezer's probably from Melbourne
Hate when people interfere. His doing his thing and this guys just being a Karen like oh no you can’t .
When "don't be an idiot" is insufficient counsel
Yeah that was rather dumb now wasnt it
Let Darwin have his day mate
Dont suffer the idiots to live longer then they have to Maybe they wont get to breed the next generation of idiots  Sides the crocs could use some nice dinner
Why bother...it's called thinning the herds 😅
Imagine someone trying so hard to save your life and you arguing with him
Any update on this? Did the person make it?...
Insanity
Some tourist do leave their brain on the tarmac.
The ego too bloated to listen.
"You think the crocs like the boat ramp because they're waiting for fish." 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Lol
Did you ride from New Zealand on your stand-up paddleboard?
Natural Selection
They bout to have a feast 😂
Those Crocks are like, " dont f..kn warn him, I need a comedian desert for supper."
If it's croc infested then he'd have been taken already.
Prolly a floridian man 😂
And from underneath, that paddle board looks like a giant fish!
These things are massive, nearly 20 foot and over 2 metric tonnes. Just the size of there head is terrifying
Must be from Malibu 😂
thats a quite chat
Insane.
Those crocs are massive too...
australia has saltwater crocs which are one of two crocodilian species that will go after and eat humans. the other is the nile croc
North Queensland. Dude did he never watch Steve Irwin. Steve always said humans had to watch out over there 😂
Croc: I like the taste of anything blue.
I went swimming in a netted area in FNQ. Little did I know 10 minutes earlier someone got stung by an Irukanji but the lifeguard didn’t put the sign out quick enough. Have to be careful in Queensland!
There's a story about a couple of paddle borders that went to fl everglades and got done in by a 10-foot gater. A crocodile would swallow this man whole.. they get up to i think 16ft.
Imagine the video we could of all enjoyed had the cameraman just recorded instead of speaking up!!!
Bless this man, he's bringing back the ol' natural selection😂
If it was an alligator it’d be a different story, but a Croc???! Heeeeck no. Heeeeccckkkk no.
Getting in the water in those places is like running across a busy highway without looking,,,  You might get away with it, then one day you won`t. Your choice,,,
Crocs see the crocodile signs, and assume this is a feeding area.          🏊🐊
“ don’t blame the crocodile when he get done bite!” Did it for me 😂
What an idiot
What is the handy cap wearing?
Its the world balancing itself out.
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it!” 👀
IDIOTS wow messing around with CROCODILES unbelievable
Since crocodiles belong there, there’s no such thing as “crocodile-infested waters”.
That man wants to unalive him self
“Don’t blame the crocodile” - Welcome to Australia! 😂
That’s funny  What a naieve visitor. Aussies aren’t idiots. We’ve been aware of critters all our lives. Listen when we say it’s dangerous!🤩
Where are the signs? 😂😂😂😂😂 sir, you’re being warned by a man with an Australian accent. Just thank ya matey and go to shore with your life
Most likely  a Asian  as usual made in China
Stinger suits can save you from crocodile attacks. Hmmm.
"where's the sign?" Don't worry bud its on the crocs forehead, you cant miss it...
Natural selection at its best.
The safest part of australia is the flight home
This Aussie is infringing on his right to voluntary assisted death by crocodiles.
😂🤦
To be fair the sign says not to swim, it says nothing about dressing up and acting like a clown 🤡
No brainier.
Nobody gonna talk about how the outfit makes him look like a power ranger
They let her free????? They need to bring back mental institutions
T H I S IS  AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
I’m from North Queensland, and I know this spot. You wouldn’t be able to see the crocs at all cuz the waters are murky.
Some people need to just be a statistic ! And dumb people like this guy is one of them!!!!  I hate to be like that! But he has people trying to tell him what he is in for! And he just wants to argue with them! So now let him be croc she -i - t. !!!!! 😅
Let people do what they want,,,, bully Are you the crocodile police 😂😂😂
Well done mate..make this type of language and attitude legal again...
I feel like he’s trolling especially bc he’s in that outfit ngl
Does he want to insult him or help him? If you want someone to listen to you speak with kindness not ridicule.
It’s people like that why we have warning labels on everything
Is that Joe Biden?
🤔..........🤷‍♂️
I saw TWO Crocs  right at the bottom of the screen!!
Where’s part two?
Another ideal person trying to be famous eaten , thumps down
everyone needs to chill
Natural selection at its finest, let him go! Idiot!!
Let natural selection happen - too many idiots in the world
He's practicing for his Darwin award
Idiot probably took off his Red MAGA hat when he put on his wet suit! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Listen, if an Aussie ever tells you " you need to rethink your decision bc you bout to die". For the love of God listen to him over anyone else on this planet bc you are minutes from death
Feed the crocs I say.
Bro’s from Florida. He’s got this.
Geez 🙄
Survival of the fitest ... sometimes you should just let it work.
But I need an official sign ...
I sure as hope that guy got out and FAST!!! And stayed away from the dock!!!! 😮
If you’re at a gun range, and the employee says “hey man, I wouldn’t…” don’t. If you’re at a hospital and a doctor says “hey man, I wouldn’t…” don’t. If you’re in Australia, in the water, and an Australian is standing not in the water, saying “get out the water” you probably should, considering their vibrant ecosystem.
Cairns has some lovely beaches, yet there are totally deserted, very regularly there are signs warning of crocodiles, jellyfish, & sharks. Everyone goes to the water park to swim and relax.  In Queensland all swimming pools are covered to provide shade and the locals wear swimming costumes that cover from neck to ankle and wrist. If you don’t dress like this to swim you’ll get bad sunburn!
Listen when your in Australia territory you’d better listen boy that’s why’s yelling at you like your father. AND P.S I think he’s only protecting the protected species not the dumb one who would get the blame for being slightly hungry 😂
This is why we have warning labels and signs
But he’s wearing a wetsuit… So the crocodile cannot bite through that 😮
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wonder why tourists get killed and eatin by croc nearly every year because they ignore the signs
This bloke is like one of those marshmallow biscuits, a crunchy base with a soft topping.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 shoulda just left him so he can find out for himself
North Queensland Crocs are very big than the Crocs you got up Northern Territory
Tourists
Shut up dude! Just shut up! Let it happen and enjoy the show. People who interrupt a Darwin Award attempt should be charged with something.
Nice to see natural selection still works. 😂
He's wearing crocs
Agro with no explination is wild.
Florida man in Australia (I obviously know it's not a floridian, he would be standing w the aussie laughing and telling mr wetsuit to 'Go on, do it!')
Dipstick! I'm being polite.
I've seen 3M Tinnys with a couple of huge Blokes in it going out fishing in Rivers in Kakadu with 5M+ Crocodiles seen in it - I just don't get some Human Behaviour at all - Id rather go to the Supermarket and buy a Fish
I say put a no-liability sign up and let them swim at their own risk. No advice, no ambulance, no assistance. Just let people paddle in peace and if God decides to take them home so be it. Chill out, Australia.   Love,     Florida
He’s a hands on learner. Let him learn
You can't edumicate Idiots....I lived in Port Douglas for 2 years and never swam in the water
You did your part just let nature take its course
Hey, crocks gotta eat too.
So did this dude make it out alive?
When they get bit...... Crocodile tears!!
If dat water is wet there a croc in it
idiots
He is confirm a karen
"You are in north Queensland mate, im an Aussie not fokin karen!!!"
Well atleast he is already wearing his body bag. Guess he came prepared
He picked the most boring activity to die for.
Natural selection is an amazing process...
Leave the crocodile have the fool
Crocs gotta eat, too.
Go feed the Crocodile.  Everyone knows better don't they..and can't stop yapping.  You been told, loser.
why warn him? Light a cig and enjoy the show. Darwin is about his work.
I hate when people say common sense to people that clearly aren’t from there. It’s just dumb. Your common sense isn’t mine so it’s unrealistic to say.
It doesn't matter where you are but if the locals tell you something, better listen. 🤣🤣
Have some common sense. Laugh out loud. Do you see what the palavra is wearing? What does he think? He's at the Olympics he needs that streamlining effect? I say let him swim. It's natural selection
Let natural selection take its course..don't waste your breath
All I see is natural selection at its finest
Dude blue himself
Florida man spotted in north Queensland 😅
There is always an idiot that mouths off at better advice. Many times these people don't live long enough to learn their lesson but sometimes they do.
Is the guy in the blue American
darwinism kids. this will be on the test.
Don’t blame the crocodile 🤣🤣🤣 crazy to have to say that to somebody.
I just love how upfront but lighthearted some Australians are  Dude’s trying to look out for him but letting him know in the bluntest way he’s acting a fool
How yer doing mate...either you eat the croc or you get bitten....
"Where's the sign?". What? So, if theres no warning sign I disregard lethal danger?  Ok Or: before i decide, i better read the sign first. 🤪
FAFO.. 😂
He sounds like a Kiwi..soon extinct.
To be fair I don’t even think a salt water croc would eat a skinny old guy dressed as a tele tubby
when the natural selection is serious about its selection
Wisdom is often learned as a result of a great misdeed. That guy’s going to do the deed but not live to gain the wisdom..What a dum-dum!
Lucky the guy cared enough to speak up.
Someone just like this is what originally clued Darwin in on natural selection. Sadly, modern times deprive most of them of the natural lesson they were about to experience 🙄
Way too kind.
Hey Crocs.. ova here
You’d almost think that guys an American
To be fair,the guy should mind his own business and Stop taking food from the crocodiles.
The lady voice is actually a crocodile talking to them
Y'all really should be quiet,and just let Darwin do his thing with the gene pool there... jus sayin mate... 😉
Where's the sign? Why not take the local's advice? He didn't sound like he was joking.
All I can hear is a bunch of Karen's screaming something if you're going to put a video on YouTube at least speak English unless your Chinese then no one cares and if he gets eaten by crocodile what does anyone care you won't see him ever again
Just let him enjoy the water, it’s his personal choice
🐊Crocs: shhhhh mate. Let him be.
natural selection at its best 😂
Australian courtesy: "Get outta the water ya dumb *******************, you're gonna get eaten." 😂
‘Yea righto 🙄🙄’ lol
Let him be croc food
Crocodiles don't care about signs
The crocodiles love the boat ramp they hang around waiting for dumb blokes on a paddle board.
Ignorance is bliss sometimes, people can do what they want and it’s none of my business 😌
Listen to the man who wears crocs and knows crocs!
Its quite simple. Respect Australia, Australia will respect you. Not worth dying over your own stupidity
"Yeah righto" - this guy, moments before being eaten by a crocodile 😂
Cameraman would be telling everyday if he lived in Florida and saw anyone swimming in any body of water😂😂😂
Darwin will eventually step in on that guy
If an Aussie warns you about something. You get out immediately the same way you got in
“Where is the sign” “One there, one there, and one over there” 😂😂😂
Dude is delulu😂😂😂. Lol you're definitely not Tarzan
Some people can’t be helped - I feel a Darwin Award coming
You know he’s not from Florida because we have 12 foot gators. 😂
Don't blame  the crocodiles
natural selection.
Just watch.. don't say anything and just watch
I thought ian hecox😂
Listen to the Australian man about the dangers his country has to offer
I vacationed in Queensland and the only water I got into was the Shower. All the locals told us to talk to locals about where it's safe to swim and DO NOT touch anything if you don't know what it is.
Shhhhh...Darwin at work.
People love doing things the hard way. Crocodile signs im out. 😂
Your just tempting Florida man
Really cant understand why with such great infestation of crocs there isnt a law that obligate the people to turn crocs into shoes or purses or whatever...
Yeeeeep, there's a reason we don't swim in the water and have free lagoons for swimming! If the jellies don't get ya, the snapping handbags will. You don't swim in the water in CQ/FNQ, unless you absolutely have to! 😂 can always pick a local to a tourist lol
Where do you birth such dumba#%es?
Terrible camera man smh
RULE No.1: Do as the locals do and say, even if it comes across as someone been rude, their heart is in the right place.
FRUSTRATING, isn’t it…?   😳😮😑
Does this clip have a Part II we might witness?
That's my neighbor. We live in Florida. Trust me, he knows what he's doing. 😂😂
This is one of those instances where they should have just let nature take it's course. & nominated this guy for a Darwin Award afterwards.
Word is they love paddle boarders with blue wetsuits 😂😂
With all the back talking it must have been a proper temptation to not just let Darwin have his way....
Listen, only people that have a chance of getting away with that are Floridians man 🤷‍♀️
Natural selection. Let him go.
When someone care for you listen to them you dumb idiot
Must be a MAGA supporter.
He just want to test the correlation of his stupidity with the Darwin's theory.
Ah, a new, blue hotdog! Says the salty.
Ooooh...lunch!
Good day mate
Natural selection 😂😂😂
He wants to die , mad man.
Darwin approves.
Youth is innocent and disbelieving and thereby..conducts himself with stupidity.
Stop warning.  Too many people survive these days by the intelligence of others.
Must be a liberal from California trying to tell the Australian how to live
crocodile don't eat anything blue 😂
Smurfer: "I'll have you know I'm a university professor and my extensive knowledge, education, and empirical learning is far superior to your mere, paltry experience."   Crocodile: "Buuuurp"
as an Australian i have a few simple rules - i DON'T get into a crocodile or sharks LUNCH BOX. if i walk in the bush i wear long jeans and sturdy boots, and if i have a dog it is ALWAYS on a lead - both can protect against snake bites. i will also say the last rule goes for my 5 acres in country Vic, i have seen eastern browns every year, my dogs were face to face with a juvenile mid spring and thankfully neither got bitten. in 23 years i've fear losing a dog, this is the closest dog encounter i've witnessed
😂😂😂 2024 Do what you wanna do!!! By all means.... Do You 😅
Silly old buggy is gonna get eaten by a standard 5m Australian croc😂😂😂😂
And he got bit 2 hours later
The Darwin Award 🥇 goes to….
You Can't Fix Stupidity
Darwin Award Recipient
Tbat outfit alone will have em nawing on ya in no time!! FOFO
Ehhh let him be natural selection
Some kunts just cant be helped
The crocodiles are wishing that these locals would mind their business to they could have their lunch in peace😂
Pride always get you done
This individual has a death wish
His common sense went years ago when he was enjoying a world that he destroyed for the rest of us
People are so fkn ungrateful, just say “Thanks I appreciate it!” They’re merely looking out for your life. DA.
When ya get done by it!!
Europeans are so rude
Teens are so disrespectful 🤯
Some. People. Can’t. Be. Taught 😮😮😮😮😮😮
But he’s got on a blue super suit!
My man… he’s trying to save your life and make sure you don’t lose a couple limbs and maybe get eaten whole. Put your ego aside and listen 😭
Bruh that's like telling a surfer don't swim because there's sharks ..mind your own business mate
Look at the way he looks... he doesn't have common sense
What do you care l. Like he obviously want to be eaten by a crocodile so be it
This is a Florida man meets an Aussie type situation that I thought I would never see.
Crocs gotta eat too
crocodiles dont attack people its so rare
Get your phone in your pocket and mind your own buisness you fool
NOBODY in North Queensland has an ounce of Common Sense. It's Redneck country.
Let the smurf get nerfed lol
I know he’s not black! WTH 😂
Blue Smurf thinks he's in wonderland.
Imagine telling someone to basically f*ck off and mind your own business, when they are trying to warn you of a real threat to life.
And everytime an ol geezer gets taken its the Crocs that get shot or " relocated "...... love how he loses patience  with this ol guy
So the locals are warning him of something, and instead of panicking he argues back? 🤦‍♀️
Waiting for the Part 2 segment titled "I told ya so."
He’s just feeding the crocodiles, leave him be. I had never been up north before… asked my friend ‘Can we swim there? Nope. Over there? Nope. What about the river? Nope. Just stay out of the water!!
😳I'd be all over myself thanking them.   Help me out too please, thanks😬
"Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it" 😂😂😂 im fu**ing sure bro 😂😅😂😅😂
On todays episode of "Natural Selection".
I must be missing something. Dude is on a board himself on the same water
No one’s swims in the rivers unless your in a gorge in North Queensland. “Yeah righto” sounds like a southerner who is disappointed he’s not getting eaten today.
Nah fu, just because you're scared dont run your mouth to someone who isn't!
If  someone who lives there is telling me it’s wrong I’m going to listen and just get out of the water.  Because they know.     I don’t know. Anything.
Dang I wonder where that croc was sitting...
Guys committing suicide, no other reason to do something so insane
The man in the boat is obviously a liberal….
What is he in? Paddling with your hands?
Man wearing crocs warns man about crocs
OK, you warned him. Next thing to do is wait, have the camera on and wait for the next 20M views Youtube video to be yours.
He's just in time for lunch 😅
It's not the croc that you can see that you should worry about, it's the nine others that you can't see...
He’s probably got some kind of dementia. No one in their right mind would do this..
I can see 2 crocs on the pier!
Just helping you out , old man
People that insist on swimming un Austrailia make me shake my head. Like the swimmer that was eaten alive literally feet from the jetty. His screams for help as a man filmed him were sad. Would I jump in the water after this guy to try and save him? Would you??
Funny he's worried of being sunburned, but not being eaten by a Croc :D :D :D
Respect the local... And you life will be much better
I remember being in Cairns area and told not to go near the water
He forgot about the other two crocs - one on each foot
The moral of this story. Don't get in the way of natural selection. Crocs gotta eat to
Why can’t people just mind their own business 🤷‍♂️
Australians do love to tell you what to do. "You're in North Qld, I'm a hard nut and I see crocs all the time"
REALLY!!!!.... AM I LISTENING TO  JIMMY LOUGHNAN FROM "Chopper"
Darwin
Relax mates. He’s got a blue suit on. They can’t see him in the water
Proof animals are better than humans.
Yep ! If an Australian bloke is warning you about having some common sense - you're in a BAD situation 😂😂
Quit yapping let the man live lol
I would listen to locals when it comes to safety… looking like he’s got all the gear with no idea.
Seriously what is this plan though? 😂 Wet suit, and... Knee board?
It's all good until it's not. 2+2=4🤷‍♂️
Natural selection let him go, maybe get a Darwin award
I wonder if he got done by the crocs in the end. ..
Common sense ain’t that common I guess. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sounds like he wants to eating.
Ahh should’ve just let the natural selection do it’s thing
Let nature take its course lol
Dont tell him, please.  Let Darwin play his odds!
And the Darwin award goes to.........
He's not a man, he's a meal!
His ready to die Hasta la vista baby😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Welcome be lunch!
Sign actually said... "A F**king Crocodile Recently Seen"
Don't tell him ❤
We paddle board in Alligator inhabited waters all the time here in Florida but I wouldn't dip a toe in any body of water that crocs inhabit. That's just crazy.
I see two crocs right there on your feet
Yeah so a single sighting of a croc? Wait till buddy finds out about southern US.
Taking a deep anywhere in queensland is braindead
That's not a paddle board. That's a saltwater crocodile serving tray.
Too many people like to hear there self talk.leave the dude to it.
Seen recently but not right now, so ease off buddy.
Natural Selection. Give the Crocs a break mate
Whats a life without a little risk
Unbelievable stupidity.
After watching Gator Chris, I have a very healthy respect for the predators at the top of the food chain -- and humans are not at the top.
Wow brilliant
I used to live up in NQ  And NT.  Crocs everywhere. More now that they’re protected. The numbers used to be kept in check.  I’m also a Scuba Instructor and I’d rather come across a shark any day than a croc.  I remember fishing at a creek in Weipa, croc signs everywhere, crocs popping up around the place, and idiot tourists letting their kids play down by the waters edge. They’d get yelled at by locals too.
The crocs love meat flavoured idiots up north.
Was that Mr meeseek's? Existence is pain to a meeseeks
Has anyone seen the blue snack pack recently.
Darwin
At least he was sun safe 😂
There are always idiots.
Men ☕
Australians struggle with English so bad I cannot stop laughing when they talk. Shane Gillis made it worse too haha just trashing. We get Aussie farmers over here, they cannot run equipment or be left alone with alcohol, or given excess money they find drugs so fast haha funniest group of people ever !
we have natural selection for a very good reason 😅
Let nature take its course 😂😂😂
He's crocodile Dumbdee...😅
Sir u are disturbing dinner time. Please dont yell.. and just enjoy the scene
I once swam in a river in Queensland called Crocodile Creek… but only because local kids said it was fine and they were swimming too! Listen to the locals!!!
Australia in crocs warning about crocs… best listen.
😩🫠😆🤣
Crocs get dinner on a plate these days😂😂😂
ahh just get the video we all want to see
Don't even argue , just pull out your phone and wait for the show.
When swimming in a crocks food bowl dont worry be happy
It’s meseeks
Dressing like a smurf does not make you immune to the crocigators. Pretty sure a Floridaman tested this one time.
The darwin award awaits ots new winner
Guess he thinks he's Steve Irwin.
Saw two crocs just in this little clip. Scary stuff
Fools don't live long.
Derp!
😂😂😂
If no one else is in the water, there's a reason.
And just like that, the blue Teletubbie didn't want to live any more.
"YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER BUT YOU CANT FORCE IT TO DRINK" 😂
He’d be the first to cry and get his mum to set up a gofundme to pay for his new limbs and Physio therapy
Bless him, he actually wants to lose a limb, he's looking forward to using one arm, and hopping. He only wants his haircut to remain untouched.
Our hotel TV continually showed a video of a Croc catching a bird after jumping 6 feet out of the water…..that will get your attention
When ya get done by it
so chumpy you could carve it!😂
I think the man wearing Crocs saying there are Crocs everywhere knows a thing or two about how dangerous Crocs are 😂
Move along nothing to see😂
Let me do my thing and you do yours. What about the people who either have to save your life or recover your body. Do you in your back yard quietly.
Say you're an American without saying you're an American ☹️☹️
Take advice from people who know the area
My vet's assistant went swimming in one of the most alligator infested waters in the area. She got dragged under like obviously, and she fought it off. Still alive today.
"Let him do what he wants and stop hassling him!" -Crocodile
Natural selection doing its thing leave him be.
What an idiot. One born every minute.
He’s really wanting to “feed” the crocs!
Tastes like chicken
Maybe he’s hoping to get eaten ( if you know what I mean).
If it scares an Aussie you should be worried.
In our crazier than ever world, the line between “sanity” & “bravery” has never been thinner.😅❤
just another arrogant pr1ck ignoring croc signs.
Don't warn him. Let the crocks do their thing. They say morons taste like chicken.
Suicide by crocodile is gnarly
Must be tired    of living
He's a snack and doesn't  even know it 🤦🏼‍♂️
😂 after he mouthed off I would just sit and watch the show
Idiots.... Let  natural selection do it thing
Life rules - when an Aussie tells you to get the f*ck out of the water you better make like Jesus get the f*ck out of the water
They always blame the crocs..
Some men you just can't reach
Have a beverage and enjoy the natural selection.
Newest contestant for the Darwin awards
yeah. don't swim where crocs are. probably never seen the programmes where they eat the wilderbeast crossing a river.
If an Aussie tells me something is dangerous, im not gonna question him
Evolution at it best😮
Just let natural selection take its course.
F*ck around. Find out.
Idiots think wild life wont touch them.... Let them be food.
Just let the food be food.
Did you need to film this guy just to warn him about a crocodile? I think I would’ve just told him there’s crocodiles there without having a camera stuck in my hand.
Truly an Alfred Hitchcock type of scene and you did not expect the honesty of the women.  First viewing the best.
Croc in a trechcoat here "I ordered the idiot in blue on the floating rice cake, whats taking my order so long"
Nah let him get his
When a local warns you, assume they’re right, especially when it involves life or death.
He’s definitely also a cyclist
Just call him a new species of fish!  It’s called, humanusstupidus! 😁
I’ve seen this with my own eyes. Took the boat out at yorkey’s and when coming back in from the reef a load of tourists were actually swimming around the mangroves!! There are literally signs everywhere 🐊 & plenty of huge crocs. It’s Darwinian
Where’s the signs? The problem with modern life, no f@cking common sense. 🙄
See I fully believe in survival of the fittest... if you put yourself in life threatening situation then maybe you aren't smart enough to be functional part of society so atleast feed the wildlife 🤷‍♂️
There's a lady who went out on a kayak and wound up with ten killer whales around her. She was horrified, she's lucky they were killer whales and no crocodiles. I watched a guy in a parachute jump in Florida hit a pontune in water full of gators, missed his target, they were swimming in on his way down, didn't last 30 seconds
Leave him be😂
He can't blame the croc or anybody if he's dead
A true contender for the ultimate Darwin award.
He is trying to save his life and he is bothered by that ???
Common sense, he has not!
Ffs!
Shhhhh!! Let him swim. Is better for the gene pool. 😅😂 That's a Darwin award right there.
The box jellyfish killed all the crocodiles. Then the drop bears killed the jellyfish.
And the Darwin award goes to,,,,,,,,,,
8:19 like the early seasons of Rick and Morty
I wouldn't have told him anything. Just sit back and observe 😆
Goes to Australia Treats it like not Australia.
I hear in north queensland has harsh summer heat, and you be sweatin buckets up and down the street.
Where the signs??? All i saw was  ground,ground and more ground
This guys not looking after him... he's concerned about the croc that will get killed after it eats him. This is a good man.
That’s no way to talk to bait, mate!
And that is called natural selection 😂
You gotta roll in chicken blood first sir!!!
Natural selection at work
"Wheres the signs?"  A local yelling out theres been a croc seen recently is about the biggest sign you can observe.
Same thing done in alaska to hikers.. don't blame the bears
As an American it's kinda nice to see that we as a nation haven't cornered the market on stupidity.
Leave the guy alone. Crocodiles gotta eat!
😂😂😂😂😂your the 🐟🐠one there one over there " common sense " 😂😂😂don't blame the crocodile
worst cameraman ever
Ahhh. It's nice to see Florida Man travel
“Yeah righto”   That right there is a true blue Aussie
I think it's great that you are doing this and making him aware.
Something wrong with his madulaoblongota
What a plonka.
Only a Karen would argue about their life being saved 🙄
Darwin calls this survival of the fittest
“Yeah righto 🙄” he says as if the people concerned for his safety are being unreasonable
See you later, alligator. After awhile, crocodile. Sorry, someone had to
This is a live demonstration of Darwinism. The average IQ is about to get a little bit higher and some crocodiles are about to get a lot fatter.
darwin award in the waiting
Natural selection at its finest…smh
Survival of the Fittest 😂
There's also white sharks there. 😂 Crocodiles and sharks. OH MY!🫣
Don't get in the way of natural selection, just my opinion.
Darwin rules apply here mate😂😮😅
Don't blame the crocs when u get done up 😂😂
If only this was filmed in Darwin, it would be so poetic
Bro like u lucky I got enough common sense 4 the both of us lol
'Where is the sign'...mate, you think the crocs care about those signs?
Let him become crocodile poo with that attitude
See, that's why i left Florida!!!! Its a scorching hot place with 110% humidity 24 hrs a day and you can't even take the dogs out and find a cool pond or river to swim in!!!! F-ing Gators everywhere
Is the Smurf on the water from Florida?
Natural selection exists for a reason. Let him be.
His genes should be denied reproduction, which apparently is what he's actually doing. So what's the problem?
It's just the law of natural selection. 😂😂😂
Cairns: mate that should be enough to stay out of everything. 😅
That at Machans 😂
Perfect afternoon dish
Leave natural selection be, if he dont care, he can be lunch and the gene pool wins!
Munch munch
There is just no arguing with a fool
Faking jump in m8 go make some friends
He's an Australian aswell. How did he not know that!
Natural selection at its finest.
Warned of crocs by a man in crocs
I live on an island with salt water crocodile everywhere and we don't even go near the sea. Salt water crocodile are way more brutal than sharks , when shark attacks, atleast your head bop out once but with salt water crocs , even fish near you wouldn't know when you disappeared.
Say nothing it's natural selection
Crocodile: dw bro, hes just hating. Its propaganda.
"When Florida man goes Australia" 😂   I'd watch that. Even if it's short and the ending doesn't set up a sequel🤔🤷‍♂️🤣
This isn’t the first time.  A buy did this in Cairns.  The crocs are there.
What an idiot. Boat ramp, fish, crocs. You are takaway food.
F*** it just keep filming
A guy swimming with crocodiles is super exciting.  But not as exciting as your epic video of the concrete sidewalk.
when he sees just how big and absolutely VIOLENT and terifying that prehistoric demon is he will instantly begin to paddle as fast as he can back to shore to which he will then realize all hes doing is splashing because all he has is nubs now
Some people don’t like to hear NO even if it will save there life 🤣👌
1st problem was trying to help. Let the dumb ones go and watch as it happens.
When Florida man goes to Queensland 😂
Like when an Aussie was yelling at us silly Kiwis for walking through long grass in jandals...we knew something was up!
I'm sorry, what hobby is this exactly?
You should probably listen to the local people... But since he's not you mental have a camera and get yourself a good shot of nature and action... And then post a video to show people why you don't mess around in Queensland water... Lol... 🤣🤣🤣
Flippin tourist mate. Common sense. Look for the signs before entering any mass body of water. It's dangerous. 😢
I've never been to Australia but I know better than to swim in any water down there if I do go
😭
Surprised he didn’t ask for the signs to be fact checked.
Absolute idiot how did he manage to get to that advanced age with ideas like this…
What did one crocodile say to the other one? Here comes another one of those "evolved" dudes.
If you're in croc-infested water, it might be a good idea to quickly find land.  And if you're visiting a different country, it might be a good idea to read about it first and trust any warnings from the locals.
this is natural selection let him be
I’m horrified for him! Crocs are aggressive and actively hunt humans unlike alligators..
He's polluting the gene pool anyway.
This guy could have just kept walking, but made the decision to save the life of a not-so-bright guy. Just thank him and get out the water.... or let natural selection do its thing.
😱
Something about you wearing Crocs while warning someone about the dangers of Crocs seems highly meta.  Good on you and the other person for looking out and being logical and level-headed during the entire interaction regardless of the person’s disregard for their own safety.
That gene does not need to procreate
Idiot for lunch
He looks like Tingle from Legend of Zelda.
This is just another scenario where your sub-conscience loses the argument
It’s simple survival of the fittest
Never. And I mean NEVER disregard the warning of an Aussie!!  Seriously!!
I honestly dont care WHERE I am... If I hear an Australian accent saying there's a dangerous animal then Im leaving
Natural Selection my friend, you tried but just let it happen.
Always listen to an Australian when they warn you..
Plot twist: the man giving warnings was devoured by a cocrodile seconds later while the other dude kept chilling on water😅
Imagine that was Florida man there
"Do what you wanna do" keeps pestering the poor dude who just wanted to paddle D:
We give information  What they do with the information is not our concern
Too stubborn for his own good.
I love Australia, but I'll never set foot there. A koala bear would choke me out, let alone the countless other dangerous species.
meanwhile me: BRO GET OUT THE WATER I CAN BE POLITE ONCE YOU'RE FOKKIN SAFE THERES CROCS IN THERE YA CHEEKY BASTERD
"Just let me do my thing, and you do yours" 😂😂
The body suit will protect you from jellyfish but the crocs will be attracted to it for sure.
STAY OUTTA AUSTRALIA!!🫡💯
Just let Darwin’s theory of evolution take place!
The Crocodiles Are Think Like Their Lunch Is Come Right Time Today.😅😂
I love Australians for this! They do this to protect you and the animals. Queenslanders are sooo good like this. Massive respect! From a kiwi
Temporary tourist .
Darwin Award
I was told if the locals don’t swim there it’s a good idea not to.
survival of the fittest...;-))
is he a teletubby?
The surge of adrenaline when you realise what's actually happening
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Crocodiles are the scariest animal on earth other than a pack of hyenas. Seriously. They literally hunt humans and will absolutely win. No chance at all.
Natural selection in action....lol
Where is part 2?  🐊💨
Now if that was in the USA we would call him a trumper🤡😂😂
Blue man was completely covered from head to toe and hands. Protection from the deadly jellyfish up North Queensland but had no protection against being eaten by the Salt water Crocodile's up there.
Idiot
I have to think this was scripted due to the stupidity of blue onezie guy. 😅
I’m also not seeing him getting eaten. He’s aware. Leave people TF alone. You don’t matter.
They never learn do they
How ungrateful
Future Darwin award winner right there
So he needs a sign to know it's unsafe.. wow stupidity
The real problem is having innocent people who try to save you get eaten.
Never interfere with Darwin.
When you see a fool, "do not disturb".
Just keep recording, get the money shot and get paid for the views of his stupidity.
Why warn him... just let nature take its course!
So. Did the blue Smurf end up as crocodile snack or not? 🧐
Me i Australia..."Can i step this way?  Cans, i now take another step?  I've seen those discovery channel specials.
Dont shoot the croc when its  the humans fault.
This is why i hate socialism. Why should i pay for his hospital bills?
The man's an idiot
Quick tip, in northern Australia water means a quick death is waiting for you.
just let natural selection do its thing.
Watch out for them salties.
No common sense
Dying to know he managed to successfully connit suicode
Sorry. But let natural selection take its course. The world will be better for it.
sometimes you have to question of human nature is too kind for it's own good. If this idiot wants to remove himself from the gene pool and feed a croc in the process, should we really stop nature?
Idiots abound everywhere!
Its 19th dec. Wonder if the man on paddleboard is still alive
There is one born every minute 😂😂
Natural selection at work
Leave him be, you told him. Just shut up.
Joe Rogan should watch this
He's definitely going to f*** around and find out😂😂😂
Is it wrong that as an American all I could think was “Please don’t let this headstrong idiot be American!” (Unfortunately we have enough of those.) I was so relieved when he had a British sounding accent. 🤦‍♀️ I hope he got out safely.
Dude literally looks like a human sized fish paddling around in murky croc infested waters...lol
The Floridian in me appreciates this
😂😂😂😂
Australians have a difficult time minding their own business
Idiot
And the Darwin award goes to the idiot on a paddle board......
No wonder most of the most dangerous wildlife resides in Australia!
Croc said "please leave his uber eats alone, hes starving !""
He must be from London
Common sense is about the most uncommon thing these days
Shhh let nature take it's course
Australians are so crazy when an Aussie warns you I hope you listen...😂
Salt water croc and Great white might be nasty thing you could encounter and this man wants some smoke with those 🙄
He has 14 boosters so he is safe
When in Rome,  do a the Roman's do.
Oh my good God, I'm surprised he didn't get chomped by the end of this clip...those areas are riddled with big salties. FFS and what a ignorant and confrontational C**t when people are only concerned for his life.
😮not to bright 😂
I think he's more concerned for the Crocs, they'll get more stigma if they do as they should.
FAFO
How you know there is croc in the water. If the water is wet there crocs in it. Lol my favorite short
Amazing. With a shark they will probably leave you alone. A Croc will attack you 10000% of the time. What a fool
Such an Aussie thing to say. But yeah, always trust the locals about potential dangers, especially in freaking Australia, where everything is out to get you...
The only thing that clown was missing was his maga hat.
FUTURE DARWIN AWARD "WINNER"???
FACKIN el mate, just listen to the fella ya flaming galah!
Thinning of the herd?
Dude is not helping that accent out any.
This is darwinism at its best.. let him..
Ahhhh as a Floridian I approve the message.
Aaah let him find out how and why crocs are an apex predator..
If the idiot don't want to listen the locals, let him. Is another voluntary victim on natural selection.
This is why they don’t need many psych wards in Australia.
Good example of how ego can get you kild
And the Darwin Award goes to…
Later that day, get bit by crocodile.  Tries to sue the city because he claims no signs were posted and he had no warning.  The Australian taking the video is his judge.
Dude is doing his best impression of a wounded seal. 😂
I wonder how some people have managed to live so long, I'd be out of that water before he finished the word crocodile 🐊
“[Conversations you’ll never hear outside of Australia] for $500 Alex”
In America we call them Democrats
Hes a grown man. Let him do what he wants
QUIT CROCBLOCKING 😂
Natural selection
AGREED.
The crocodile isn't gonna mess with him. Mind your own business
Don't blame the crocodile
Let him go 😂😂
You just can't help some people! Just let him go! Idiots!!
"Go swim out in the ocean. But don't blame the crocodile 🐊 when you get done by it" 😂😂😂😂 the accent makes that phrase just gold!!!!!😂😂😂😂❤❤❤ I love how he says crocodile
IDIOT!!!  That is the Croc's home, not ours... His arrogant Ego will get him killed.
Croc, ' don't tell him that, I'm hungry! '
I mean mind your business
Let the nature take its course...
Nice gimpy suit.
Are swimming crocodiles more aggressive than alligators
I agree with the comment about being insane if you’ve got an Australian yelling that you’re crazy because the videos I’ve seen of Australians doing daily things like fighting a full size kangaroo for your dog’s life. This man boxed a kangaroo to save his dog because the kangaroo was trying to drown his dog and that’s something normal they would go after a kangaroo and box it so if they’re turning to you and saying you’re doing something dangerous yeah I’d stop doing it😂
“where’s the sign”   *proceeds to point to 3 different signs*
If you unironically use a knee board then you're doing everything wrong.
My man can’t even die in peace without someone recording 😅
He's in a bright blue wrapper to show the croc he's junk food.
You see how he had to back peddle so he didn't peel out too quick so he could finish talking?
Just as well he wore the full bright blue suit - the crocs were probably too busy splitting their sides laughing to make a meal of him.
He is trying to save your LIFE! Have some decency on your life guy. Sheesh!
As someone who lives in the croc infested North West of England even I know not to do what this dangleberry is doing. Is this close to Darwin, home of the Awards?
If an Australian gives you advice about safety in Australia TAKE IT
I wonder if he made it out in one piece/alive 🐊 👀
Costa Rica!!!!!
Columbia?
We once called this "Natural Selection".
Thinning out the gene pool
I really thought I would hear an American accent so I’m very surprised 😂
Leave the man alone, he's fine. Just keep recording.
Salties aint going to bother this guy. They get their bellies filled with fish at the boat ramp.
Darwin's law of natural selection at work here.
Yeah righto
Can’t see any Crocs due to the fact the Sharks are them all 😂
My north Ozzie brothers and sisters not worried by crocodile in the ocean so much As the sharks ate them !!!😊
We fail as a human race when we actively argue to save an idiot from themselves.
He identify as crock meal don't interrupt him
Awe I miss Curtis he loved Paddle board 💀🫣
Wait, crocodiles eat fish?!? 😂
It’s Australia, that should be enough to convey the seriousness of the situation.
That guy is used to swimming in the shallow end of the gene pool.
This screams Darwin Award
Only white folk 😂😂😂😂 gotta love em lol
Living in Australia period is crazy… 😂
If you ever hear an Australian say "have some common sense" evaluate your life.
If you hear an Australian slightly raising their voice at you, reconsider
This is a whole other level of reckless stupidity. But yeah, if he wants to die in the jaws of a Salty, then that is his prerogative.
That's a fully vaccinated outfit
Soon as this man mentioned anything, I would’ve said on my board and started crying he would’ve had to come and get me😂 😢 🐊
I told that to a customer over home.Depot once do what you want do I can't control you
Aussies are a nation of Karens. Don't forget- they put people in camps for testing positive for Covid. Also, they confiscated everyone's guns. It's not a free state
I'd have just gotten popcorn and a camera, and waited. Viral Darwin award incoming. Might be cold, but come on, sometimes natural selection's gotta happen.
He's definitely an American
If I was there I would just say "Rest in peace mate! My condolences to your family mate. Do you want me to record your final moments?"
What an idiot
crocs on the side: common mate,let the man be. were just going to hug this gentleman😂
I think people that have never seen a f****** crocodile up close trust me you don't want to they're f****** vicious it's like a dinosaur come to life
Democrats are morons
Australia's version of the cyclists
I gurentee you don't need a wetsuit in Queensland you'd boil
It's North Queens Land mate . 😅
That’s right DON’T BLAME THE CROCODILE!!!
“Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it”
Natural selection mate
Blue gear looking kind of lame I probably do it in blue jeans and put tie red scarf around my waist
Nice Smurf suit
I swim with alligators in Florida..... What's there to worry about when God calls you home you won't stop it either way. Let the man swim in peace.
Excuse me! Bubba, the biggest crock over near the dock, asked me to tell you to “shut up mate!” He doesn’t want you to scare poppa Smurf away, he’s never tasted American Smurf before and he’s looking forward to it! 😂😂😂😂😂 ( and the winner of this months Darwin Award is…..) 😂😂😂
Ya Flaming Galah 🤡😂😂
Or just don’t go to that forsaken island of snakes, dinosaurs and death spiders.
“I’m fully aware of it”  “Where’s the sign 👀”   Bro filled that wet suit immediately once he was told there was crocs near the boat ramp 😂
Natural Selection
I like the way they speak "don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it" 😅
Make leave me alone I'm sure it'll be someone's meal😂😂
WOW 😮
Bros wearimg crocs.... while warning u about crocs. 😂
So did the idiot in blue get attacked by the 🐊????
Thats a fafo situation
Don't blame the crocodile 😂😂😂
Listen to the man in Crocs warning you about the crocs in the water 🐊
I feel like Darwin mentioned something about this… 😂
Let him be, mate. He wants to feel the bite of a croc. He's an Aussie superman.
He is now being used as crocodile metabolism energy
It would’ve been classic for the guy recording to walk away singing “the circle of life” at the end of this interaction.
Did blue man lose his paddle or what?
Let him be croc bait if he wants to be mate😂😂. He obviously shouldn't reproduce in the first place 😂😂
Yeah and if he passes the crocodiles and gets to the ocean then he has to worry about sharks
In ireland we'd be like "ah sure look best of luck" The sign pointing is optional
Evolution is not for all a good idea...
I almost went swimming in Darwin when I was in the Navy and our ship ported there. A local warned me moments before I went in and I am forever grateful. I had no idea crocs were in the ocean when I was a dumb young 19 year old. That guy may have saved my life.
Darwinism will win out
The Crocs are like let him be
Makes no sense.
Mate!!!   Calm Down will ya?    HE'S just out there to FEED the Wildlife  is all !!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is this the guy who voiced the seagull eating a squirrel.
I can already see the croc getting his hand and pulling him in😅😅😅😅
I want to visit Queensland just to meet the blunt Aussies
Let natural selection do what it has to do....
Idiot probably a foreigner or from Melbourne 🫠😑😂
Stop trying to save my life and gtfa
Darwinism
People interfering with natural selection, smh
Lol you forget sir.... he is from florida 😂
The only  man my  Australia brother's wouldn't say anything to would be  Steve  Irwin RIP Croc Hunter ...
Is there a second part to this video 😂
Sign says don't feed crocodile's
Mind your business
This happens in FL all the time.  When northern move down, first thing they do is jump in the lakes. lol.
Let Aqua man be
Stunning camera work.
Just let natural selection take its course, just laugh as you go by the guy
This must be a fellow Florida man on vacation
Idiot!😮
It's ok to admit you didn't know
Wowsers, really??? I would be like thanks for saving my life.
I think about the game “Dumb ways to d☠️!!”
Ignorance at its finest. If someone is counting the crocs 1 there🐊 1 there🐊 and 1 there 🐊 instead of mouthing off at the Great Samaritan, I’d be asking if he could assist me with getting out of that danger zone. It’s not his fault, he wasn’t raised with lessons pertaining to one having good judgment in dangerous and life threatening situations. Sometimes people rush God’s times and we have to accept it!✌🏽
Reminds me of that story of that man still swimming near a wooden platform by a diner, even though everyone told him not to ....  Crocodile was waiting for food under the platform
Unreal.
That’s the way a crocodile lover gives literally everything to feed them.
This is like one of them American videos of an idiot walking upto a Bison in Yellowstone, but with a much greater risk of death.
Floridians watching this like, FAFO. 😂
Guy thinks he knows better, let him findnout how hungry the crocs are.
Well atlease he aint gonna get sunburnt 😂😂
Darwin’s theory at work  Thinning the herd
He British?
Don't argue just let him know you're going to post him on live link
Idiot!
What an idiot !!
Feel sorry for the croc having to taste and digest that rubberish suit
This is what happens when liberals go out into the country!!!!
Bad case of "I'll die before I'll be told what to do"   Was anyone else waiting for the croc?
The Crocs are starving and he cares except for his blue anti-dew suit.
He believes the chick but not him. Typical male
Leave the guy alone. Australians and New Zealanders have been brainwashed by their government that safety is above all.  Let him enjoy the water
Why say anything? Never interfere with Darwinism.
pls sir my kids are here can you not get eaten by these crocodiles
Got to love our Aussie cousins ❤
Natural selection. Let him fk around and find out😂😂
Lol not suprised used to live up there and I've been that guy. used to walk my dogs on the beach, tourist wading around the estuary picking up cone snails because "tHeY'Re BeAuTiFuL"
Why warn him? There were 3 signs, let nature take its course.
Saying something like that to somebody who lives in Florida or Australia is like telling us that the water is dangerous because you might drown.
For me, Australia is a no swim zone unless it's indoor
If i was the dumb blue man id listen to what the guy is telling him. Id really like to know how this story ends
Darwin Award winner in the making 🤣🤣🤣
Acceptable loss
"Just leave me to do MY thing" Famous last words
So did the man in blue in blue become lunch or did he have a fun day
Natural selection will do it's thing. I appreciate you trying to save a life but sometimes ya just gotta let the crocs have their lunch special.  It's Christmas for them too ya know!!❤😂
All together now: 🎶 "Dumb ways to die. So many dumb ways to die..."
His name is Dundee.  He knows what he's doing.
Let people enjoy things
“Where’s the sign?” Bam bam bam 😂😂
Crocodile infested waters? It's their home.
It's not like North Queensland is within the range of saltwater crocs, the largest and most dangerous reptile on the planet  Wait ..
That’s right, tell him to mind his business 😂😂 you absolutely have free will
The world could benefit from one less self entitled,  narcissistic, leftist, wannabe greenie in the world.😊
If Crocodile Dundee is advising you to be careful by dinkum you best take note skippy
Don’t even argue, this is what you call, natural selection
Can we have a follow up video of the Croc having a snack?
Where's the sign...because the guy warning him just isn't enough. 🤦‍♂️
As soon as the woman starts yelling he’s like “yeah righto” don’t want to hear that tone anymore 😂
The concrete is so cool looking
Is that Paulie?😅
Come on Darwin award
Scared people (Karen’s) sound way stupider from down under mate
Darwin is at it again.. poor crocs don't eat that it's bad...
I love the Australian accent.
Crazy 🤪
Don’t deny him his dream of winning a DARWIN AWARD!
I guess we all find a way to get a rush!  Some people do drugs, some people jump out of planes,  and some people just love to be around dangerous creatures!
Man gets bit by crocodile and now it has to be exterminated for literally doing nothing except what's natural to it. Ffs let natural selection work!
Self entitlement  Simple as that Prob english
Australia is not for the faint of heart. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night for fear of being killed in my sleep by some 6in spider.
I’d be thankful for someone telling me I could die for splashing and paddling on top of crocodile filler waters 😂
This guy's using his hands.. i wouldn't want to be on that thing on a windy pond.
He's dressed up super prepared for paddling, but not at all worried about crocodiles 😂😂😂😂
Doesn’t Australia have salt water crocodiles too that are much larger than the normal one so he could truly get destroyed if they get him
Just let em go bruv, and get your camera out, at that point at least get a viral clip that you could make some money off. 😂
Stop protecting idiots. Let nature do its job.
No no no let him earn his Darwin award.
He's obviously an American looking his Red cap. 🙄
Serves him right if the Croc does get him! He's been well warned 😢
Come on crocodiles need to eat
When you get done by it lol
Fucken haole people, go. Let’em get eaten.
When an Australian dad and Florida mother make a child
This is so me fighting to get my lunch down and the lunch would be a little  blue..well please make my meat more well done please.
My dad says. If you are going to be dumb, you better be tuff
I See That Idiots Are Worldwide😂😂😂😂😂😂
Listing to an ozzy talking about there courtyard it save your life they know there  land better then any person listing to locals might save your day
Fkin love the aussies. Spent 8 years over there. They are fkin awesome people
Cant be a local,,,
Did nature take its course?
muppet
Next Darwin award will be given to this guy right here...
It’s ok… aren’t we overpopulated?
Another Darwin award-in-waiting.😊
Natural selection.
Everyone in the world knows not to swim in the waters of North Queensland. There's no need for warning signs.
Gene pool cleansing
Just ask.  " Is it alright if I film you being eaten?"
‘I’m not telling you to get out, but there are crocs, and they will eat you, but you-do-you’.  The proper response to that is ‘thank you, can you help me get out’ not “where are the signs?”
ALLIGATORS  do that too but are not as aggressive as Crocodiles
I feel like personally just listening to the locals accent the fact that he's from Australia of all places the land of killer beast is and he  inviting you not to go in the water I would listen.
Good example of a liberal, No common sense 😂
Just look at the guys wetsuit😂😅 that tells me everything I need to know
There's always one 😮😅
Keep the camera rolling mate
It’s called natural selection. Bye bye.
Why waste your breath!!
Well the dude is on a knee board paddling around in Croc infested waters in a country he is not from what an imbecile.
asian
What an idiot
Was he ever seen again?
Leave him be, let natural selection take it's course !
if he wants to be an idiot why try to stop him!
oh man just let the croc's dine in peace!.
Natural selection at its best
The man paddle boarding must be a woke entitled idiot 😂😂😂😂
Oh man after the first bit of attitude I would’ve let the crocs convince him
What a Class A idiot.  (An ideal Crocodile 🐊 snack.)
My favourite detail is that the guy with the camera is wearing crocs
Hey Mate, SHHHhhhhhhhh, Let him be  - 3 Crocs
An Australian telling you to have some common sense. Listen.
He is testing his life insurance policy!
HAY CROCODILE LOOK ITS A SMURF WITH A SUICIDE MISSION
Just let people do what they want you not his daddy or mommy, if he wants to swim with gators or crocodiles let him, natural selection always wins
What a fool. When a local tells you it’s dangerous, listen to em’! Those crocs can be massive and won’t think twice about taking you out.
Best example of Darwinism I've ever seen!! 😆😅😂 🫣...........😵!!
He probably thought you were talking about your Crocks. 🤣
He’s asking for a disaster
Darwin award attempt
That definitely had to be an American! 🤣
Let natural selection do what natural selection does😂😂😂
I'm a virtuous woke person. God wouldn't let a croc get me. 😊
Reminds me of watching people in the Okeefenokee Swamp feeding bread to wild alligators with NOTHING but grass between them and the gators, and not much grass, at that. Potential Darwin Award winners.
Not crocs, but alligators are in every area there’s water in Fl. Everywhere! People are clueless. Some of our gators have adapted to bay level salt water. They are everywhere!!
Like those that rolled up their sleeve for the covid jab let play roulette if wants to
Free food for the Crocs
Natural selection!.😂
Australian crodiles VS tourist with a room temperature IQ
Just let him get his award...
The most exciting time when I did the IRONMAN Cairns was seeing the crocs and jellyfish warning sign. Luckily no encounters with both during the race. Only saw the crocs on the Green Island.
Australian animals are crazy ❌ Australian people are crazy ✅
Anyone rmember the comedy parodies of Chopper Read?? If he was still alive he would have some great comedy material if this idiot gets done by the croc. "FKN CHOMP !! 🐊. Aint swimming now are you Smurfboy".
Remove all the warning labels and let the problem sort itself out.
It’s called natural selection. Let morons be morons. There’s too many people on the planet anyway.
Stop warning these people and let nature take its course
“Wheres the sign?”  “One there, one there, one there…”  Gotta love when someone’s immediately proven wrong
Darwin person!!
Darwinism
I really don’t think this guy cares about the other guy.  He cares that when a shark or croc attacks a person there’s national outcry for the animal to be killed
I wish you could import some North Queensland to the US for a summer.
To all tourists, if it IS OR WAS alive DO NOT TOUCH IT.   also pay attention to signs even those that aren't posted, for instance, if it's hot outside and you go to the beach and there is NOBODY there, then for the love of everything DO NOT GO IN THE WATER.
"thank you"would be the right thing to say instead of "yeah right"🤦🏻‍♂️..they just safe your life..
You shouldn’t warm them let evolution and natural selection take care of everything
This guy is Aboriginal
To be fair, crocs gotta eat, and they don't mind idiots on the menu
Watch out for the crocs. Not in the water, the ones on his feet.
Darwin was right after all.
Typical marxist stooge lol
Why try so hard to protect him from his own stupidity and ignorance.. let nature take its course 😅
Sad that this Man, is taking offence in the fact these kind people are warning him of his impending doom, Wouldnt you thank them and quickly get out hahaha My gosh how do you take a man seriously tho that goes out in croc invested waters in a smurf outfit lol
Let nature take its course, baby proofing like is is the reason we have so many morons walking around
Ego... The guy's Australian, he should have known this already 🤦‍♀️
JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE THE VIDEO 😅😅😅😅
"Have a commin sense"???
😂 just like telling them to not pet the fluffy cows (🦬) 😂
New Zealanders smh 🥱🙄
“I’ll do my thing and you do yours”. Ok, I’ll stand back and observe while you become food.
You was supposed to film not speak.
“Yeah righto” 😂
Crocks love fresh food
Went to a deserted beach in Australia, can't even remember the name, but it had signs everywhere that there'd been shark sightings....do you think we went into the water? Errrrr. Nope! 😂 I decided to take the local advice & stay out of the water 🙈
Australian man versus Florida man
Just leave him alone... 😅😂
Have you never seen paddle boarding before? Let people do there thing. I swim at least once a week in croc water, it's my job. If I don't go in my job is redundant. Only ever seen one croc in 7 years
You can’t fight dumbness
Some people just do not want to be saved.😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
What an idiot!
Crocodile infested? Looks like a human infested area to me
😂😂😂😂 he wants to be dinner for the crocodile 🐊 s😂😂😂😂😂
As shown common sende aint common no mo
Where do these idiots come from, Mars!!
Bro trust the Australian they know better than anyone.
As an Australian, if I'm in North Queensland I wouldn't even trust a bubble bath 😂.
Natural selection.
He’s dressed on a dinner plate.
did he meet any crocs?
"Where is the sign?"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In north Queensland's you don't f...around mate.
The only thing that prevented him being lunch. The crocs were too busy laughing at his get up.
Was he eaten? Don't shoot the croc.
Why didn’t you wait a bit, then you would have had a better video! Ha ha 😅😮😂
Darwin lives.
I love that he has the suit for stopping jellyfish things, but doesn’t care about the crocodile
Darwin Candidate.
You should only advise once.  And then let Darwin awards be delivered.
Maybe he is from florida
Papa smurf Wants gator nuggets.
Some people have a death wish, and common sense isn't in their vocabulary.
How DARE you tell me about the crocks that are going to try and eat me!
I'm not sure what this guy is worried about. There is zero chance that this individual will blame the crocodile when he got done by it.
I would’ve told em one time . He obviously seen the signs😂 and just shrugged and walked away . Did all I could 🤣
Let nature take care of the idiots..🤷‍♂️😅
Leave the poor Smurf alone!
Dumb!!!!
If he argued with me while trying to warn him about crocs....i would of just shut up and let nature take its course.
2 men in a disagreement over feeding the crocodiles?
If this guy is American, let the crocs have him. We’re trying to filter out all the dumb ones over here.😂
Let him be croc food
Let nature take its course.
Did he at least get mauled?
Lucky you were there😮
How dumb can one person be
Just let nature do her thing...some people cant be saved
Dumb, dumb, dumb!!!!!🙄🙄 And the Darwin Award goes to.......
He wants the prestegious Darwin award, why are you interfering?
Don't argue or warn people.. sit back and watch the show😂😂😂
Where’s the rest of the video where the crock took him under?
Utter madness  !!
I came for the comments...
Natural selection.
I would listen
the lost member of the blue man group doesn't need some outback local to tell him where to swim in crocodile infested waters..I support you blue man keep enjoying your outing and camera man you keep recording.
leave the bloke alone crocs have to eat
Another Darwin award participant. I lived in the NT and witness a man taken by a crock. The man was trying to swim to his yacht. From the Tropic of Capricorn its not a good idea to swim in the ocean.
Crocs need food too.
Gogogogo mat have a nice day 😂😂
Humans are a'holes...
Natural selection, as you were
Why even pull out your camera just to videotape the ground ? 🤔
You are dead
"you didn't save my life, you ruined my death"
NO worries Crocks afraid of the color blue😅
If he does get eaten, can I suggest we call the croc "Gargamel".
After you warn him, no need to argue or push the issue. Just let Natural Selection run its course. *We have to STOP saving and protecting idiots.* Because they reproduce and just make more idiots!! Next thing you know, they’re in politics and winning elections. We just had this happen.
DONT WORRY MATE CROCKS HATE THE COLLOR BABYBLUE 😮
Meanwhile, the Crocs  saying  shut the F up we are hungry  bro😅
Just because you can warn someone who is dressed like a Smurf not to swim in crocodile infested waters doesn’t mean you should. -Message from the Crocodiles
Idiot
Florida man on vacation
Ya'll did your best. Not everyone's gonna make it
Welcome to nursing 😂
Darwin was right
Natural selection will take the correct course 10 out of 10 times with this one. Astronomical odds have gotten him to live as long as he did.
Google tourist deaths NT WA .My regions famous for lost at sea n died of thirst. 3 in one year recently.
Jesus is coming ❤ God loves you
Aussies are the best.
Thats not a real warning sign now is it? No its a fkkn crocodile recently seen sign mate😂😂😂
No words . Boomer entitlement
What a fwit
You look like a tortue to them
Do u know most signs are German only?
Those crocks are 20 feet long for all you Americans out there.
In Louisiana if the water is wet there are Alligators in there
What a dill!
*This guy filming is known to crocodiles as a "Croc Blocker"* 😁
…and the 2024 Darwin Award gos to?
Where's the sign? If the sign is not there, it is not my fault I got eaten..... Idiot 😂😂😂
Darwin's theory at work
Boomers are the same across the globe it seems 👀😭
That's interesting. He changed his tune when the woman told him but got aggressive with the man at first. Can someone say "issues"?
And the informer is wearing crocs 😂❤
That sounds like Travis Fimmel talking. Probably is. He’s a legend.
Where is the sign?  It’s because of idiots like this we have to have sign’s everywhere for every dumb thing
Definitely votes labor
Man clearly has dementia
Posh cambridge accent so obviously a snobby stuck up brit. They know it all and ignore you unless you speak 1950 oxford muffin the mule accent .
Can you sign this,  awesome have an awesome paddle.. insurance claim on
Dont f with the water
I live in cairns and there was one swimming along the beach down from Palm Cove towards the airport only two days ago. About 40metres from shore.   Not that big, only about 4mtres. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Let him, natural selection at work.
The irony is that the man warning the paddler is wearing crocs
Goodbye  😂
“Go swim out in the ocean, but don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it.” Is the best advice we all need to take, and the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard.
Kameltoe voter croks love the senseless 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Choices mate. Life is about choices. From what I see, you need a bit of help making choices.
Yeah and it's not alligators. It's f****** crocodiles totally different
“North Queensland has the longest unbroken chain of crocodile warning signs spanning 1500 years”
Natural selection
Aussies trying to prevent a smurf from earning a Darwin Award!😅😅
Douchgebag 🤬😡🤦🏾‍♂️
“Australia man” is the “Florida Man” of Different Countries 😂
He is an expert, he even wears crocs!!
His a leftist they seem to know everything but not a lot of common sense 😂
It's okay ... it's natural selection
Crocs be like ....man we been waiting for a smurf for like forever  ,shut your mouth let him swim...😂
This guys a Crocodile expert. He is even wearing croc’s 💪🏽
This man is as stuborn as a mule!!!
To be fair, there aren’t any crocs around that boat ramp. The sharks ate them all.
Natural selection.  Let him go lol
Natural selection
Another Darwin Awards candidate.😂
Ah ah ah no mr crocodile don’t eat me !! There’s no sign to warn me 😂😂😂😂
Oh please leave the man alone....crocs have to eat too
Just so everyone is aware, in north Queensland, people will warn you with temporally finite language like "when" or "eventually" or "later" or "will" because crocs/salties are just a question of "when" and never "if"
He might be a trained Crocodile wrestler! Could be he’s just there for some training.
Well then, what are YOU doing there?
If he was that arsey with me id have just left it at that 😂 not gonna try help someone with an attitude like that.
Don't listen to him, I'm not here - The croc
I bet he's a cyclist 😂🤦🏽
As a far north Queenslander  I bet you this was at the dane trees Crocs don't mess around up there, every year there's always one tourist there who becomes a snack
Natural selection.
Nah this guy is either the bravest or the dumbest guy alive, I believe he is the latter. 🤣
My daughter lived in Hawaii for 10 years and would tell me stories about tourists not obeying signs posted where there is danger. Unlike coastal beaches, island beaches have different currents and the chance of dying in a rip tide is much higher. They would get swept off rock formations by a big wave and either injure themselves severely or die. If someone told me I was in crocodile infested water I wouldn’t argue.
He has his jelly fish stinger suit on, he will be just fine.
Let natural selection run its course with this guy
Irony. It's near Darwin.  😅
Australians are obsessed with other people’s lives. It’s disgusting.
You’re too kind.
"Don't blame the crocodile" is peak aussie
😂😂😂
Why’s bro looking like an aqua Smurf 😂
Just keep the camera rolling mate 👌
The crocodiles like the blue M&M’s too!
Perhaps the salesman told him the suit was good for jellyfish and crocs
Ye caint fix stoopid
Eeekkkk 😅😅😅😅
Darwin Award winner right there
I would tell the guy in case he did not know which is possible . From there 2 options , the guy is panicking and gets on board or he is arguing and I leave . Simple .
What an idiot
I guess it's called natural selection for a reason 🤷‍♂️
And the 2024 Darwin Award goes to.....
As a crocodile, I can genuinely and confidently say that we don't appreciate this man's kind warnings. Please mind your business sir. Let him do his thing.
Only a man dressed like a blueberry twizzler would have his ego so bruised by someone trying to save him
Crocodile Dundee has retired mate, get out of the dinner pool
Nexy post, man getting eaten by croc
If an Aussie or and American is telling me I'm the crazy one, Im'a gonna stop immediately.
There only signs 😂
Where's the sign, mate!?, there's one there, one there and one in each boat ramp!! And still he ain't listening...
Australians are the canadians of the world.
Never defy a warning from an Australian PERIOD....😅
All the puddles have teeth once you get up north
What would ray gun do?
Saved from a Darwin Award.
Crocs never eat anything blue😂😂😂😂😂
ohhh A WOKE AUSIE  that feeds Crocks
Another tiktoker
I thought I saw one lurking in the water, but it was the shadow of his cap
Killjoy. 😏
Im not a gambling man, but id bet the house he spends most days in lycra
Just let Nature and Darwin do their thing man, dont interfere with natural selection
Darwin Award winner coming up!
The Aussie version of "Florida Man"
Just leave him alone.Dont say a word.
Great example of Natural selection.
"Have some common sense". Bro is dressed up like a smurf kneeling on a paddle board in crocodile infested water. I think we are long passed him having any intellectual thoughts.
"Yeah righto" 😅 buddy definitely high as a kite or his Mrs did him in😅😂😂😂
The guy is dressed up like hes ready to film a youtube prank video.
He easily outpaddles a croc on his plastic board. What’s the fuzz all about? 🙄
This guy is nuts!
Crocs are scared of Smurfs
Let nature do is thing
Just let the crocs have a feast sir, don't waste your time arguing with someone who don't listen😅😁
Blue smurf on paddle board: "Its ok, I know what I'm doing.  I've seen Crocodile Dundee 3 times."
I fully support Darwinism...
Nice logo for the channel.... bunch of worms
I hope he apologized n thanked him. What an idiot response when he just saved your life. SMDH.
Crocodile : 🤷🏽‍♀️🤫🤯🤬
Natural selection at work here.
AND THE DARWIN AWARD GOES TOO..THE MAN WHO WAS LAST SEEN IN THE VIDEO
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Crocs don’t eat smurfs he’s fine 😂😂😂
Meanwhile croc pointing out limbs to his mate, one there, one there and one over there
Grab a cup of coffee and have a seat in my peer chair and let natural selection take place.
😂😂😂🤬🧠💀💩😂😂😂🚫⚠️⚠️🚫😂😂😂
LEAVE HIM! TAKE OUT YOUR CAMERA! 🤣
Like I always say everybody’s gonna have their own experience🫠😵
He probably a cyclist having a dip, crocs love woke folk ,looking forward to scene 2 ,JAWS 😊😊😊
I havent been to Cairns for over 25 years... i dont remember the crocs there(like around human places). I only remember them in Northern territory. Does anyone know of their population is somehow expanding?
Why are people always trying to stop natural selection?
Does anyone know if he made it out alive?
thats an accent I would take seriously when it comes to animal based danger.
it's not "crocodile *infested* ", they live there.
Just let natural selection happen
He identifies as a salt puppy chew toy.
Sit back, enjoy the show, done all you could‘ve for the bloke…
Useless hippy
Why would you argue when they telp you crocs are around 😂 “Oh no let me do my thing”
Come to Australia and find out button
What an idiot. Someone is trying to save your Life....and you are being rude.
Natural selection at work
That's insane a crocodile will just jump on that and drag him to the bottom
When an aussie says have some common sense listen to that person 😂
I thought the short will end up by that paddle boat guy suddenly getting swamp by megalodon crocs from underwater
Some times you just gotta let nature's natural selection take its course. Theres a reason the Dodo bird isn't around today. The waeker & dummer dont make it far. Let that young fellow feed the crocs..
I lived in the Kimberly's. Stick to fresh water for swimming but still keep your eyes open because the salties still have legs.
Comedy  Gold. Must be a politician - He knows best and has no common sense .
Duh bro, let the natural selection do its job, why bother🤦
I was in Costa Rica a number of years back and we saw a sign near the beach. Peligro! No bano aqui, esta crocodillos!
Natural selection. It's a good thing.
Natural selection mate
In my experience an Aussie will generally give you the respect to fall in your own hole, break your leg and figure out your own way out of the hole with your own broken leg. For an Aussie to be actually suggesting you're doing the wrong thing must be pretty serious.
Blatiant croc food...!
although it Queensland, this is a Darwin Award !!!....nothing to add.
Lol, says he can do what he wishes, but won’t just let him do what he wishes.
Crocfluencer
The guy on the board must be a Democrat
RIP to the old fella, he should have listened  😞
Dressed like an idot lol shoulda let him do his thang. He knows what hes doing
Crocs don't like blue bottles 😅
That's not a knife.This is a knife
CROCODILE DUNDEE
Bit over the top if you ask me
1 man reported missing from the local  funny farm🐊🐊...
Survival of the fittest. 😂😂😂 some people are morons.
Crocs food
As an Australian, I cant believe he didnt see the 3 signs. Usually there's barely 1.
Sounds like an Aussie  Looks like Croc food
This bloke might be dumber than the 🇺🇸 democrats
Yet He aims camera at ground and not at signs.
Maybe he wants to commit suicide?.... He's clearly blue.
i wanna see the continuation of this full with an interview of why this dude was so set on doing this
I'm just looking for that shadow just under the water maybe you'll see it but probably not!
And dressed as a seal, ready to play the part.
I guess he will find out the hard way, fool's will be fool's and this one is definitely a fool😂
Even the crocs say no to this guy. He's safe.
Well now he’s mad his fam won’t get that life insurance money it’s gonna be classified as a suici. Now thanks guy filming
Go on let him be croc meal leave him alone
Here crockie.....crockie....there's a snacks for you...come and get it...🖐🖐
What a idiot
😂😂😂😂😂😂yummy 😋
🎀Stubbon fool🎀
If a local gives u advice...listen.
I would have said, "Please continue. I am going to enjoy the entertainment you are about to become."
he wins the Darwin award
Maybe he wanted to die.
Darwin was warning Darwin
hahaha aussie is deem full to the brim with dangerous creatures. without a common sense will get you no where, possibly death. no where.
The gene pool sorts itself out
Don't protect idiots, please.
Look he was warned...the gene pool will be better off either way
I'm a kiwi but even we know where to not swim mate like crocodile bro good sign where not to swim
What a plank😂
Just let's natural selection takes place
American Democrats don't listen
QUEENSLANDER
Angry gay gun in the water
At least he has his stinger suit on.....😂😂😂
Mmm...Aussies ain't what they used to be.
This really shocked me.  These days I expected someone to simply pull out their phone and record the man being turned into a tasty salt water treat!
Ssshhhhhhh, just take a step back, let nature happen. Im quite sure this guy is on the short list.
Croc "hello!!!! can you hear me?  I'm coming  to get you!!!! Waaaahhh!!! Mate.. these beasts will stauk you and might not see them till they body roll you!!!  What an idiot.
He’s going to get eaten up! 😮
Male Karen in the water that can’t accept they’re in the wrong.
Australia has Karens too?
"sign says no crocodiles allowed"
WHITE PEOPLE 😮😢😅😂
I can't believe people still want to test our country
Mmmmm dinner  Welcome to Australia 🌏 lol
This is why the locals know best. You ignore their warnings whatever may happen after that is on you buddy. I would have for sure taken their advice and gotten the flip outa there 😅
I wouldn't eat that. Just sayin'
Let him win a Darwin award.
This would have saved the tax payer if in the English Channel whe had those crocs
This man clearly never watched Steve Irwin 😂 (i miss that man)
Leave the man be... he deserves the Darwin award he is so desperately trying to get.
i really need to see footage of how this ended...
This ain’t southern Queensland where you can pet the crocs on your morning swim. Get F$&@ed mate.
That man might be in line for a Darwin Award.
Hey guys. Let Darwinism do its thing. It works.
What a flogger 😂
Crocodile: "that dude is trying to save our next meal, can they just leave him be? "
Shame on you for making that croc go hungry!!!!!
That water looks so comfy tho
Future Darwin Award winner 🏆
Just let him be the crocodile bait if he’s so stubborn
It’s bad enough being an idiot, but being a blue idiot? You’re absolutely dedicated to the role at that point.
I’d rather get mauled by the croc then have to hear another second of this dudes Aussie accent. Bro, shut up!
Bro just wanted to earn his Darwin award
Tellin someone where there at is like that nicest way of saying they dont know where they are lol
Go budy go, say hello to The crocodil 💩💩💩 brain
Let the fool go and play with the crocs.
Bro if I was already in the water and some one came up and told me that my blood would run cold lol also never woulda entered that water anyways
Always listen to the locals. I saw someone d*e in Hawaii when I was living there. He wasn't listening to the locals to not swim too far out and to not swim past the bluff. He just wouldn't listen. He may have even been caught in the current, but he kept yelling that he was fine. It was really sad and even took the lifeguards half an hour to recover his body because of the dangerous lava rock bluffs. A helicopter was hovering above the whole rescue time, and air lifted him away when they finally got him. A 23 year old man's life lost because of confidence. Just listen to the locals, and don't be afraid to show humility if something is going wrong.  This happened at Kahena Beach on the Big Island in April of 2019, on a Sunday. The guy's name was Tyler. Just thought I'd mention that in case anyone tries to say I'm lying.
Big lizard on th Beach swimmer nets in th mangrove creeks th croks are soooo fast they do eat people yum humans are a delacy for crocks
Signs are for 6 year olds
Comments here did not disappoint!
Yeah do your thing😂
'I don't listen to humans. I only listen to signs.'
Does anyone see the irony of what's on his feet, locals about to eat 😂
I’d say natural selection
Its a blueburry on a cracka mate, snack toime!
Darwinism at its finest
Wat a douchbag
🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Leave him he's a wasted human being..
If an adult plays in a busy street, we know they have mental issues. Its the same with a man on a tiny surfboard hand peddling in croc infested waters. Even more insane to be truthful.
This video should be shown to kids when learning about natural selection.
Australians are disgusting
Aussies love telling people what they can’t do because they are controlled by their Govs like Nth Korea.
Crocs gotta eat to
Stop letting nature take its course. Leave these people alone. 😂
Tell him off for being a lunch m8 . The crock loves idiots.
Australia’s Prime Minister once went for a swim and was never seen again. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is what happened to him
This man looks like an idiot in that suit and that board is ridicculous
Leave him be the crocs are hungry they gotta eat too😅
1000% fake and staged and dumb
Did he make it to smurf land?
Ten seconds later when hes screaming for help tell him to do his own thing 🤣🤣🤣
If i tried to warn someone from death and he told me "go away" i would go away he knows what he wants apparently
Stop saving these people. They will breed and then... oh, wait too late.
He's from Melbourne, trying to find some good coffee up north 🤣😂
When an Aussie is telling you to “look out”, then you better be looking out!!
Rules don't apply to me! That's what the cross say. Tool!
Crocodiles have to eat too
You can't stop a fool from being a fool.  Foolishness is nature's way of smartening up the gene pool.
Probably a leftie,shouting about his rights,tell that to a crocodile!😂😂 😂😂
Darwin's gotta eat too!😊
The locals know a bit more than a possible asylum seeker
I would listen to Ozzie
When an Australian is screaming at you not to do something he knows the wildlife you should probably listen to him
This logic is the same as sharks live in the water ao dont swim 😂😂
Jesus christ ive never felt such fear watching someone do something
Darwin award waiting to happen.
In Hawaii we call people like this " sharkbait"!
Does this guy go to the local beach everyday and conplain at everyone swimming. People swim in cairns 😂😂
Only in Ozzie land😂😂😂
i live south now and i’m still scarred from getting to close to ponds 😭
Just let nature take its course!
They love the shade if it is hot out
Do crocs eat smurfs??
Did he die
Swimming in a lagoon in Hawaii, I was literally lifted out of the water onto the surrounding rocks by an old kahuna. He was pointing at a 6 foot long barracuda swimming right where I had been. After a while, he got in the water, looked under and said it had left so I could get back to shore. I may have rivaled Mark Spitz that day.
You realise how many people actually swim in nt 😂😂😂😂
Let him go and get some decent footage
There's Superman...Batman...and then there's Dumb Croc man
Chill Karen
He doesn't value his life or have the ability to make safe decisions.
If you look for idiots...there's plenty that inhabit our planet
He needs to see that movie with Mr dunnee
You're not saving his life. You're bothering him. Let the man make his own decisions.
My Florida senses are tingling. The croc sees ol son paddlin.
The blue teletubby 🤭
Confidence is everything.
Did the sign say "Crocodiles don't swim here"  Punctuation, or the lack of it, is important
Natural selection is allowing people who wear a MOCAP suit for a swim to get eaten.
its his fourth amemndment right to get eaten by a croc 🫡
Natural selection at its finest. As an American I lothe that Australia is a great home base for natural selection at its finest.
There’s a Croc right on the dock!  Two even!
Darwin Award!! 🤪
Dont you have a town called Darwin? He's clearly a resident. Lives on one of the dead end roads.
If an Australian is criticising you for your poor choice of action.. then you have no excuse for being so confidently wrong.
Youre welcome. Jesus christ
A wise man would just mind his own business.
Just let natural selection take its course
That guy is insane cairns is croc infested
I wonder if he made it?
Maybe the gene pool needs to be drained, eh?
I heard those crocs are vegan and gluten intolerant so he should be alright
Crocs: Rick, mate, stop warning him! we hungree 🤣
His business to risk his own life.
Just let nature do it's thing 😂 if someone told me this, I would be kissing them for the advice 🤗
Hang on, is he talking about crocodiles or his Crocs?
Darwin award-winning!
Something similar happened in South Africa in 2011, shark was spotted at Fish Hoek, even though the beach was closed and the white flag was raised, he still went into the water , lost both of his legs, one got amputated above the knee, the other below the knee
Let food be food and get on with your day… how else is it going to win it’s Darwin Award 😂
I've been to the northern territory and northern Queensland. You have to go super far out of your way to avoid seeing warning signs.
Let Darwinism do It's job.
As an Australian... we call this natural selection
Yeah they dumb...that happened here in Cancun... Next day just heard bout them people gettn eaten by a croc
I mean 1st of all if I'm in a whole a** nother country the first thing I am going to do is ask the locals about any and everything I might think won't be a good idea before doing & second if a native is telling to do something or not do something you best believe I'm going to listen bc it's called respect
“Sherman did you eat all your fish?!”
The dingo ate my baby
dumb af video
Its gunny how a guy minding his own business thats getting spoken to rudely and like an idiot is viewed as the bad guy by society. Leave people alone not everyone is scared to die
A pair of crocs helping ya mate
'Aw men! Don't tell em. We been missing a few targets' - Crocodiles talk
Mate pedalling at half the speed of smell💀
Darwin was absolutely right!
Copping an attitude when someone is trying to help him. Hopefully, he hasn't reproduced to contaminate the gene pool.
Ending an argument, Aussie style: "Yeah, righto."
He's vying for a Darwin Award.
You can clearly see the 2 crocs in the video.
Crocs are worse than alligators. Crocs will literally hunt you down and wait for hours even days to get their prey
The Aboriginals celebrate this thinking let the crocs continue to thin their demographics 👨🏼👩🏼 amongst other things. 🤷🏾‍♀️✌🏿😝
Natural selection
Let the croc help out our gene pool.
My problem is Roos in country Victoria potentially killing my Husky dog if she chases 'em on the property... let alone not listening to a local in Nth QLD who knows about big 'Salties' in the area.
What’s your problem? He had his safety suit on for f’s sake 😂💀
Mmmmmmm...lunch.
Ignorance is bliss
They used to call this natural selection.
And they walk (or swim) among us. 😬
Reminds me of that idiot that climbed down into a bear's den and the bear showed up.
Great vision! 😅
Wonder if he was eaten.
natural selection. 🩷💕💕💕💕
WHERE IS THE SIGN !!!! Sorry mate you DONT have any COMMON SENSE… that is the sign of a FOOL
I live in Australia & have been to the NT. & North Queensland. Crocs are everywhere & that numty is the main course!
Darwin Awards Contestent.
When see something say something fails:
'You in North Queensland Mate' end of story
And this kids, it what it looks like when you have a death wish.
paddle boarder is definitely from florida
Wow
Isn't Darwin Oz nearby?
Feed em.
California?
"how dare you try to save my life!!" LOL
Let the old man get bitten by a crocodile and the  people tried to warn him. So it would be the old man fault if he dies or not.
A wallet and a nice pair of loafers
Man's just trying to feed the local wildlife
Natural selection at its finest
Ah , A Darwin award contestant!!   Will he win???
Crocs gotta eat too!! 🤣🤣🤣
Swimming in Australia is insane ...
There's one born every minute! 😏😒
Evan Kelmp would have just asked him what he wants you to tell his family when they can’t find his body.
Oh he won’t blame the crocodile
What an idiot 😩
Idiot
As the Nigerian’s say: wisdom is chasing you, but you run much faster 😂
The second I heard “crocodile” in a Aussie accent I’d know things just got REAL! 😂
Candidate for a Darwin Award. Thank you, on behalf of the Crocs and our gene pool...
Crocs gotta eat too😂😂😂
Imagine thinking youre above a 2tonne APEX predator on a boogieboard 😂 let him swim
Where’s the sign? ONE THERE ONE THERE AND ONE RIGHT OVER THERE
"I'm Sonic, I can outrun any lizard!"
Just let nature take its course, we need more natural selection.
Yes sir ty excuse me my mind jumped out of gear can you please throw a line ty .....
Natural selection at work here,let him be.😅
Darwin will win on this one
Some people are suicidal and just don’t realize it.
natural selection
Salt water crocodile..that make alligator look like transgender.
Dude forgot that in Straya, humans are a part of the food web, not above it.
Darwin award
Shhhhh, don't save him. He's trying to earn a Darwin Award
Don’t blame the crocodile
Yeah right-o matey!!!
Funny that the bloke would rather be chomped on and drowned by a crocodile rather than admit hes wrong.
Crocs: "Smurf's back on the menu, boys!"
One there. One there. And one over there. 😂
I feel bad that a croc might have to digest that ridiculous suit.
Again, I thought I had seen someone do some ignorant stuff in another video and thought it was the dumbest thing that anyone could do...but here's another person to prove me wrong. Even though this guy is #1 on the "Dumbest Person" chart there will always be another person to take his or her place. Does anybody know if this idiot became lunch for some hungry Crocs/Gators?
It’s like a cyclist but in the water.
Don’t listen if you want to die
One of the few places I will pass on visiting.
DUDE WAS BOUT TO GET SMERKED BY CROCODILE 🐊
While wearing a full wetsuit ffs!!!!!
let mohamed do what he wants and leave him alone
Nominated for a Darwin Award
More importantly don't expect anyone to help ya now that you're well informed, idiot
Salt water crocs are very large and aggressive.
Incredible that you need a sign.
Bet he's Canadian
Natural selection, let them go
Why not show us the  Crocs ???
If the water's wet it's got gators/cros in it
The crocs  need to eat to he was warned.... in water we humans are at the end of a food chain ..
Must be an Envoy airline employee.
I hear kids in Australia get nature safety sessions. Something this midwestern city person can’t relate to.  Kind of like other countries can’t relate to our school shooter drills.
Ppl are special you tried ,some need to find out the hard way
Gosh man I’d be like thanking the guy not yelling at him😂 I’d prolly ask him to possibly help get me out 😂😂😂
2 hour's later they found his board covered in blood ???
Where is the sign??  Mr crocodile : imma bring the sign for you
Where's the sign? One there, one there and one over there! 🤣🤣 OWNED
Florida man sighted in Australia
Natural selection in action.
I only give multiple warnings to my son
Real smart
Don’t interrupt that man! Let Darwinism work. That’s why we live in a society of read hards. Too much safety for the idiots.
Gave him a fair warning and was ignored. Let nature take its course at that point. Signs to save idiots only go so far
Death Wish
He knows that crocodiles don’t eat clowns.
You can only try, giving the warning. Sprinkling the salty language provides emphasis. Some people just insist they are in their rights 🤷🏻‍♀️
Kayaks and bodyboards and the saltwater ridiculous
He's trying to deny Saltie his breakfast!
What an idiot
Let Darwin awarda be
We don't need that guy... let him get nommed
On tiny paddle board with no paddles. 🤦‍♀️
He should let this dumb Teletubbies becoming a crocodile’s nugget what an idiot
We are taught early here in Australia as we are never far from something that can hurt or end us. Even swimming in the wrong spot if you are not aware of certain facts but hey if you dont want to listen like the bloke said ' its on you so dont blame the crocodile '. Some people 😮
Don’t u dare give me life saving advice!!!!! F you!!!! Don’t tell me what to do!!!!! 😂😂😂
Crazy
I was stopped by an old timer from crossing a estuary channel in nth Queensland, he advised me that bull sharks were incredibly common in that particular area and that what I was planning was not a good idea....
Hey will send you all our Karen's if you want to get help get rid of them
I will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS take the advise of locals when it comes to wildlife. You’re asking for trouble if you don’t.
BE WARE      YOU MAY NOT SEE A CROC. 😮    OR    GATOR  😮  BUT THEY  WILL  BE   LURKING   UNDER  THE  WATER 😮😮
I would give a warning and walk away if he was to get eaten well his fault you’ve been warned
😂🤣,, locals warned you m8..
What episode of Bluey is this?
Croc town
Dude...just let nature take its course at that point and get a vid you can sell to some dark web site😅
let them go
Yeah go do what you want to do you , have some common sense
We’re watching “Natural Selection” here.  🙈
"Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."
See, if we let idiots decrease the surplus population, we wouldn't get gems like this😅😂😢
In South Africa we have a river named the Crocodile River...our North Eastern lakes and rivers teem with crocs
This is an absolute masterpiece and pure instance where an old boomer still believes he’s right!!!
This week the Darwin award goes to …………………..🤣
Let him go, he doesn't appreciate being warned, he's an idiot!
I think that dude might be a remnant of the first Matrix.
Hey, I know what to do. I've seen Steve Irwin on tv
I get the feeling the smurf survived. fortunately for him.
I would have been nudging my public pretender like come on man! Object! Relivence?!?
Silly people
Crocodile wondering what a teletubby tastes like 😂
You know what they say, do not interfere with nature taking its due course 🫡
Bon appétit Croc....hope it wasn't too chewy
Yall would have a fit if yall come to Florida. 😂
By saving this man you have effectively degraded the gene pool.
"Don't get eaten by crocodiles!"  "Don't tell me what to do!"
Welp he was warned 😅
My guy really said "you're not my mom!"
Had to been an american white men for harris... you know the same kind of guy that voted for biden...
Whew, at least he wasn't an American. (written by an American!) 😅
people keep saying “if an aussie says get out of the water, get out of the water”  they are both aussie
The guys going to die
This is a lovely video of the ground. Can you do one of a wall next?
R.I.P to the man on the paddle board!
Papa Smurf is about to be lunch
I didn't know teletubbies form part of a salt-water crocodile's core diet.
Please just let evolution take its course
There’s usually croc signs everywhere so this guy is deliberately disobeying. Darwin award right here.
DARWIN AWARD WAITING TO HAPPEN. 😅
Is it just me or is the guy trying to deny a big lizard a free snack.....wearing crocs? If he is...fabulous!
And then there are the Chironix  and the funnel spiders.  Remember to have fun.
This man's life was spared by the complete lazyness of at least 5 crocs saying "meh, not worth it".
Survival of the fittest
"All animals know love" - this guy (probably)
Prime candidate for the Darwin awards 🤔
XD yea tbh I come to let the do whatever they want I live an hour outa cairns and trust me it’s even worse here
I know him! They made a film about him: Crocodile Dunde. 😆 Just can't see the knife. Hm
Holy s. Did this white man tell another white man to f off regarding death by crocodile. And did some Aussie karen just chorus it?
He just protects the crocs from getting a bad rap and getting hunted for being themselfs. Well done Sir.
Hey, gotta hand it to him, his commitment to his mission is un breakable. God speed mate, and don't ever leave your house again if you survive.
Not to mention those surfin' 'roos who resent anybody surfin' in their turf.
He wants to prove how ignorant he is!
Love how he is arguing good advise given to him that may save his life and absolute idiot
When you get done by it, ha ha ha ha
Camera angles 😂😂
Must be hetman
Everybody knows Florida, Louisiana, Australia, & African waters are filled with all the things that will consume you.
Hes got his croc repellant
Stupidity at its best
Bro if i ever visit Australia, I'm staying inside
Wow. What an idiot!!
Oi, someone prepare a Darwin Award
Is the blue man american and claiming his freedom entitlement powers? 😮
He not from here😂
An Australian would know.....
but did he get eaten by the crocodile in the end?
American tourist? They don't do great in the US at national parks with buffalos.
Dumb ways to die...
Oh let him go. Let him learn.
Morons   It’s like you tell them. “don’t stick your finger in the socket”.
Just let nature take its course
Well let's see if he turn up on evening news. Man got eaten by crocodile
Let nature take its course. 🫡 That outfit was so embarrassing 😬🤣
wearing crocs talking bout crocs that is some croc talk
i vote we abolish signage... make common sense great again!
Lol..crocodile said..HELLO  DINNER!😂
In all fairness anywhere you go outside of the plane landing at the airport your taking a risk of geting bit or ate
😂❤ Crunchy on the outside....Gooey in the Middle 🐊😂❤
I think the Smurf Man is British... listen to the Aussie's you idiot.😅
...was this guy suicidal?
Survival of the Fittest I say
We are watching Darwin’s theory of evolution in live action.  Survival of the fittest doesn’t mean just the strongest 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
I mean you tried. When he said "yeah, right" to her idda walked away. Some peoples genes don't need to be passed down.
But don’t blame the crocodile 🐊 when you get done by it😂😂😅 Hilarious
I can picture him trying to get away 😂😂
The planet does not need more idiots.Darwin was sooo right.
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THEY STEP OUTSIDE ALL COMMON SENSE IS LOST!!!
If an Aussie is telling me to get out of the water you best believe I’m gonna listen to
But why endanger your life I don’t and can’t understand this madness 😮
He didn’t realize he was talking to Steve Irwin.
paging ozzyman for the next scene
How do you say Darwin Award in Aussie?
Deluded boy: I’m a special effects blue screen person, they can’t see me. Local man: But the crocodiles can eat you.
That entire Continent is a death trap, please use common sense before going into nature in Australia.
Cyclist mentality
He is hoping that his Stinger Suit (blue lycra suit to protect from very painful Jellyfish stings) also works to stop stinging from croc bites
Theres crocs out here, check my feet mate!
Trust the man in the crocs, about the crocs! He knows his stuff.
Leave him
As a Ugandan we know to be on high alert around croc infested waters. So many unreported deaths due to crocs occur and im amazed by how Europeans lack basic survival imstincts coz i saw a tourist Kayaking in a known dangerous part of the river Nile.
You’ve spoiled my day! 🐊
For anyone wondering, here's a fun fact; Crocs are the national footwear of Australia. We replaced the old trusty thongs, because Crocs have sports mode (makes running from the drop bears and hoop snakes way easier). So if you ever see an Aussie wearing Crocs, trust me they hold authority over all wildlife within a 100km radius. We are actually telepathically connected to at least one Wombat per person. My best mate is a Salty named Gregory and he approves of this message. Merry xmas fellas ❤
Video thief
lady sounds like she's talking about the friendly neighborhood cats
You just interfered with DARWINISM, please., Stop doing this, let em go
LHD
A guy wearing Crocs telling another guy about   getting eaten by Crocs😂
Definitely a blues supporter 😅
It sounds like in Australia right now , that guy would be the one to get in trouble for both trying to help the guy or not trying to help him
Soooo you think they lien and just gas lighting you about being eaten alive? 😂😂😂😂 sure that makes sense 😂😂
Darwinism at it's finest
As soon as I heard northern Queensland. Bro is cooked
What a drongo
Can't fix stupidity
Honestly. We are 8 billion people on the planet. We can spare a few.
Well...Crocs gotta eat too🤷
This video smells like Vegemite
He is trying for a Darwin Award.
Darwin's always lurking...
Telling a guy about crock signs with crocks on about to see a man get eaten by crocks
Guess they don’t know about people from Florida.
This man interfered with natural selection. No common sense means your something else's food.
Never interrupt a man in the middle of a Darwin test...
natural selection at its finest.
You know, the crocodiles have to eat too.
Some people I should not reproduce
The guy made shoes out of them m8 he knows what's up!
White boi tryna be a croc bait, classic.
Natural selection at its finest!!
He’s Australian, I’m American and Ik there’s crocs in the ocean over there😂😂😂
Let him be, its Darwins law of evolution in play, dont interrupt with nature 😂😂😂
I get wanting people to mind their own business but when the locals tells you there is danger nearby you best adjust properly
Natural Selection
You can't tell  those that are smarter than the locals.  Let the croc have a treat
Something so wholesome about random strangers being rude so that you don’t hurt yourself
Who cares about dumb people. Idiot
Great job at positioning the camera perfectly at the floor🥴
And great whites
He wants to win an award. A Darwin award 😂
As a 7th generation Floridian who also happened to grow up on a crocodile farm here , I can tell you that if you can’t see the bottom of the body of water you are swimming in , you should probably assume there’s a crocodilian in it. Especially in south Florida.
Note to self, avoid Northern Queensland...& maybe Southern Queensland too, just to be on the safe side.
But l do this all the time in Victoria
Just be nice and tell him don’t berate him
CROCK BLOCKING 😂😂😂😂😂
Crocs don't just travel fresh water, they go up or down the coast. This is Crocs territory NQ
He's right, good on him for telling the paddler.  crazy.Ive been and Ive seen the massive ones like a  Croco saurus 😮
Wow
This guy is determined to win The Darwin Award. I hope he wins. 😄😆😅🤣😂
NEVER IGNORE A WARNING FROM OCEANIC PEOPLE . 😂
Is he really arguing😂
Darwinism is soooooo funny 😂😂
Have some common sense,, even just a little bit😂😂
Can’t believe he needs a sign. Lol
It’s been scientifically proven that he’s dressed like people who get eaten by crocodiles.
Why?
That wetsuit is going to give the salty some nasty indigestion.
Well he will know he was in the wrong when he wakes up in heaven 🤣🤣 nah joking 👀 but sir some idiots just need to learn the hard way ..
Typical Floridian
This is just natural selection at work
Opportunity to get some great footage missed here....🙄
It amazing to me that some people have made it past childhood lol
"Where's the sign?" Proceeds to point out THREE with ease!
When you get done by it...
Lil don’t blame the crocodile. Bruh just gave croc a free pass
We really need to stop saving these people. Let nature takes its course, survival of the fittest. Saving these people is the reason why the world has turned out the way it is.
Can't read apparently or is ignorant
Let natural selection take its course guys 😂
“You’re in North Queensland, have some common sense!” You should always heed the locals buddy, they are trying to save you bacon. 😮
What a crock!
The croc is saying, mind your own business and leave my dinner alone.😂
I mean, why would they lie about it ?  He’s legit acting like they’re exaggerating.   Dude.   She said that they love waiting around the boats, that means the boats must be fishing and have scraps they unload.   Can’t believe this dude is really out there paddling like he’s living his best life.
It's not as common as people think. Shark attacks in Florida are more common.
Also, why’s he dressed up as if he is in the arctic?
2024
This is the same type of guy that would touch the animals at yellowstone park in america
And the winner of the Darwin Award is .....👆!   😂😂😂  I live in South FLA and even I know better!
why don't you put his info out there JD
Natural selection
He is the reason why one should use condoms
There's no crocodile mate. I only see concrete.
Far North is big where is this
Ok if anyone is warning about unknown water accept the warning now you know how people get grabbed by crocs and gators
An australian on vacation to New Zealand was just so thrilled and amazed you could sit on the grass by the shore.
Yeah he definitely was trying to give a croc a free meal 😂
Poor ausie dont realize that man is from Florida😂
Those salt water crocodiles are lethal
Aaannnddd.....another "statistic"....good. The gene pool absolutely doesn't need his input.
Croc bait mate
That’s a death wish
HOW DARE YOU TRY TO SAVE MY LIFE 😑 Natural selection is a real thing 😂
Great, you ruined a good video..people like this is why everything is labeled.
Loud mouth nanny state cops on a power trip just like in Anerica.
HE IS WEARING CROCS HELP
He is a idiot mate
This is what happens when people don’t respect nature. Saltwater crocs demand respect
Darwin Award this guy right now. And if you do come to Florida and we tell you where not to swim then there is a reason. Trust me. Trust the Aussies too.
Just leave the guy alone. Police state.
Beggars belief the stupidity.
I really don’t understand how naive certain people can be.
Only a fool will believe that they can defeat something that they haven't seen before.
“Yeah right.”   At that point let nature takes its course.
If an Aussie is telling me I'm losing common sense, I've have lost it completely then.
Darwinism will work its course. 😮!!
Based on his footwear it looks like the pier is Croc infested too...
😂😂😂
Two words : "Darwin Award " .
Darwinism at it's best.
If someone with that accent is telling me anything about dangerous animals, I’m 100% believing them.
When the locals are saying, Dude!.... Then, like.... Dude!!!!
Why censor there face?
One thing Aussies love are rules and regulations.
“You’re in North Queensland have some common sense” lol
He's even WEARING crocs, I trust this man implicitly on crocodiles
Darwin award candidate
Like people who go into shark infested waters on their surf boards & paddleboards, wearing full on black suits, which make them look even more like seals
This is why the LAW needs to change when you have idiots.  😠😡🤬
And the Darwin Award goes to……..
Maybe they'd stop attacking surfers if nosy c**ts like you would stop hunting and riling them to make footwear. Don't have the audacity the lecture others on common sense with those on your feet.
This world is full of ignorant idiots. Unfortunately, random luck keeps them from being eliminated by the Darwin Effect. We're probably doomed because many of them have faked their way into positions of power. Oops, sorry for the monologue.🫠🫠🫠😵😵
When the aussie says, "Hey mate, there are crocodiles about."  You can rest assured. There is indeed a crocodile in the proximity.
I can confirm, Cairs in QLD is croc waters.
Just let natural selection take its course.
If he wants to be eaten while dressed as the Silver Surfer that's his business
Just let natural selection take its course.
😵
As someone from the southern part of the USA that has alligators, it still shocks me when people assume they aren’t there, you ALWAYS assume they are there. And crocs are way worse
Aussies don't get to be armed for defense like us Floridians can. Their government hates them.
Ironic that is a Darwin moment but in Queensland
Hey the crocs havta eat someone…umm, I mean something.
Just remember in Australia everything wants you dead
Was he ever seen again?  😮
Visit the U.S. and go swim in the Everglads, warm and oh shiiii
Whats really shity is this guy probably wont help the next person that is ignorant to the area.
This is how evaluation works
Natural selection.😂
Come on, mate. Stop harassing the smurf. The Croc has to eat too😂
Hey the crocs havta eat someone…umm, I mean something.
Its a Melbourne city /suburban person
"Where's the sign?" Literally every ****** idiot ever who always think they're in the right.
Go ahead mate, go earn that Darwin award. Natural Selection.
It's funny how the guy warning the other guy is wearing crocs!
When I lived in Queensland, the first piece of advice I got was " stay out of the waters.' when at the beach, stay within the natural rock pools. If you're lower in the Gold Coast, near brisbane, only swim in the most shallow water at the beach. Let's just say, I followed every single piece of advice that I could about wildlife in Australia. No reason not to listen to the locals about wildlife
Oh my goodness
get a release from him  and ask him to do tricks with his paddle board. as you film for a documentary call it happened on a Sunday.
Ahh .....Queensland? I thought this was Darwin😺
Why aren't those signs in English?...😅😂...he just wants to be on TicToc...
So shepherd is Canon
Dunno about you but I’d trust advice about crocs from a guy wearing crocs
Darwin Award goes to....
dino dinner
No worries, crocs are vegans 🤪
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF A KAREN!!!
Liberals escaping the country? 😂
You tried, Mate. Now, just keep filming!
They’ll love that blue in the water look like a giant takis
What the flip is that water sport
If someone with that accent tells me something about animals potentially eating me, I'm listening immediately.
Tourists....think they know everything.
I’m never getting in water because there might be crocs, and I live in Canada
Nice view of your feet and the water!!
Florida man goes to Australia.
This is the same way we feel having Donald Trump be elected. Do what you going to do but don't go blaming the rest of us when you get bit... Common sense is not common in any part of the world I guess anymore 😮😢
His headstone will read "I didn't see any signs"
Is that Townsville??? God I loved watcbing the tourists up there, pulled several  fishermen of croc slides
Thsts why they should have never given up their guns
Common sense indeed
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
This video was Bob Katter approved
Circle of life.....YOLO
Don't argue with the man, he's busy looking for his Darwin Award. 😂
We need an update video. Is he still alive??
I would've walked away the second he said just let me do my own thing. Some people absolutely need to learn the hard way
Darwinism at work.
I was probably saved by an Aussie guy, I was at Byron Bay and it was a pod of dauphin close to shore in shallow water. I started rolling up my pants and decided to go in the water, til a guy that was standing nearby said... Hey mate, do you know where there's douphins, there's probably sharks. I changed my mind lol
Hillsborough County Florida had a home theif disappear from police in a bayou.
Bro thinks he has yoink plot armor. There’s only one Fishing Garrett.
If the Aussie tells you not to do it… DONT.
"Where's the sign"? "Errr....to your left, to your right and right in front of you, mate"? 😂
If I was a local there I would be calling out a random name. When the guy ask me what I am doing. I'll say calling out to the crocodile to eat you so I can film it. You think they'll get out of the water then ???
maybe he boarded all the way from sweden? and he knows better?
He's not dumb to be fair....he's going by the "crocs don't eat a***holes" rule crocs go by in N. Queensland.
Theres 8 billion people in the world, let natural selection do its thing, man.
"Where's the sign?" Oh, you're one of the reasons we have those signs eh?
There can't be any Crocs because there is no sign. Great logic.
Maybe hes a married man !
Proof humans have cheated survival of the fittest
Where is part 2
You just can't fix stoopid
Darwin taking notes.
He just wants to be on social media as the guy who swam with crocs 😵‍💫
Bro. If that man says, "Watch the fuxk out." Shut up, and get to stepping, seriously.  I'm not saying stay out of the water. If you're a native or expert, you got it. But their's just some places we don't belong.  That place is a crocodiles kitchen, you don't belong  there.
Let nature take its course
This is exactly why coffee cups need to be labeled "Caution,  coffee is hot"
What an idiot !
And the darwin of the year award goes to....
No problem... Darwin award...... probably woke.... so if one less society wins.
"Oh no, go ahead mate, go do what you want to do."   🤣😂🤣😂
He's probably from Florida he's about that life mind your business
It's called Natural selection.  let them get on with it, I would
Stop cockblocking peoples Darwin Awards, that's why the world is so f'd right now. You're interfering.
Idiot.. doesnt even realizehe is surrounded by crocks
On todays episode of The Darwin Awards...
If you are talking to an Australian, you are talking to someone who made it to adulthood despite crocodiles, blue ringed octopi, box jellyfish, stonefish, redback spiders and God only knows what else.  Even an angry Koala or two.  I would listen.
Must be a Trump supporter.
Ignorance is bliss
Maybe he got dressed up to look as good as he would taste to a croc. Poor man, must b miserable to want to do this at his age. Bless him.😊
Where’s the sign? There, there and there 🤣🤣🤣
Most people are not going to listen. I think at last the kid did listen.
He’s probably American
The Saltwater Croc in Australia are so big, They can eat a fully grown 300 pound white man and still feel hungry afterwards.
This is how yankees act when they come to florida
And the Darwin award goes to...
"Where's the sign?!" Is that guy Portuguese?! He sure sound like! 😂
Imagine a croc just appeared from the murk as hes flapping at the aussies
Fk that let him achieve the Darwin award ffs.
Natural selection at its finest
Don’t bother. This is like those countless tourists that get attacked by wild animals every year for trying to pet them.
I know absolutely nothing about North Queensland except that them kids be on smoko and that you shouldn’t go swimming in crocodile infested waters.
Looks to me the guy in yhe water is in crocodile soup and hes the noodle😅
Darwin Award winner 2024
He should definitely follow the saying “precaution is better than cure”
Take the locals advice!
When dumb cannot be fixed….. crocs would love this dude
Stop badgering people. Verbally assaulting them. Just tell them of the dangers. We will never need someone to be lecturing us. Shut.
Its ironic because he is wearing crocs
It's amazing how dumb people have become.
Dressed like an idiot and bout to be a snack. Good luck
Arguing with idiots is the hardest thing in the world, props to this dude
Lunch. That’s that dude’s name: Lunch.
The crocodile ain’t gunna complain with his succulent blue chew.
Bad form we don’t crock block mate 😂
Hey, Crocs gotta eat too😂😂
And we're talking about crocodiles not alligators😂😂
just mind your own business
Natural selection will out
Australians are insufferable
I’m sorry but the guy telling him off is in the wrong. He should just have taken a seat and start recording a video for all of us
Darwin award winner right there.
Natural selection, why didn't you let them be xD
How is sitting on that tiny plank in a smurf suit a reasonable way to spend your day anyway
Pure ignorance (I was kind of rooting for the Crocs to get a nice meal because some people just have to go) and my man still kept trying to save his life white privilege😂😂😂😂😂
Death by ego..
Let natural selection take its course....
Potential Darwin prize
Is the “Smurf” a man? Sounds female to me. Equally ignorant!😮
Legend says that there's a crocodile swimming around with a hand coming out of it!
"Where's the sign?" Bill Engvall has entered the chat.
Its crazy wanting to be right so bad that u double down in crocodile infested waters😂
If I had an Australian man filming me swimming yelling don’t complain when the crocodile bite  I already knew I fd up
I saw a guy on a sit on top kayak up the Daintree River. We had just seen 3 big crocs. He didn't give a toss and he was a local. Another thing, how come the crocs look so clean when they are lying in mud?. You'd think they'd just come through a car wash.
Everyone knows crocodiles don't eat smurfs
What an IDIOT 😂
Mr tinkywinky lawyerman foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr incredible.  His "actions"  so called, causing unnecessary negative footage of Mr tinkywinky and showing him in negative light.
Where's the signs!!!😂 RIGHT HERE,HERE,HERE,HERE ALSO ONE IN BRAILLE ONSHORE 😮😮😅
You never argue with retards... you just let them go about their business and enjoy the show when things go sideways! LOL
Future Darwin Award Winner!
Well...what happened to the man???
No kid, you're not fully aware.
Stay silent and keep filming next time 😂
Literally  have salt and fresh water crocs . These are not American alligators these are man eaters
🤔 he was safe, wasn't no scary black people out there.
“Dumb ways to die. So many dumb ways to die.”
Leave him. Some people need to learn the hard way
Poppa smurf 2024
I think the thought process is that crocodiles are probably scared of the blue man group.  They are creepy, so I get it.
This blue guys gonna be Croc bait , . On the bright side.... He is probably a democrat. .... so,no big lose .🤣😂🤣
Jeez... Just let the man receive his Darwin award in peace.  😂😂       😱
Same as when FL Man stops drinking his 🍺 long enough to warn you instead of watch, rethink your choices!😮🐊😎 & He looks like an appetizer!
Wow
No commen sense required
Its crazy that water is a death sentence over there. I could jump in and flap like a distressed animal until i died of exhaustion where i live.
Floridians get it😂 you did all you can do. They don’t think about the authorities that has to call that mans family, the people that work emergencies and cleanup and transport.
And they never saw him again...
The guy recording is wearing Crocs😭😭🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀 it's HIM, he's the croc
Yes, crocs eat dumb people too.
This is what "Natural Selection" looks like.
Natural selection at work in real life!!! Loooooove it!!!
This is what "Natural selection" looks like.
The surfer reminds me of the natural cycle of life and survival of the fittest, and if she doesn't survive, well, thank you crocodile😊😂😂
Leave that man Alone!  He identifies as invisible and silent.  The crocs can't see, hear or smell him.  Long luve liberals and all idiots 🤣. But, for the rest of ys, keep those cameras rolling 👍
Some things you just don't do
"Leave me do my thing and you do yours".....until im screaming for help and then you have to fish whats left of me out of the ramp
(No thats a f*cking crocodile recently seen sign 😂!!)
Dude! You had one job. Imagine what a good vid you could have got when he got snatched up. Croc's got to eat. Where was he from anyway?
You see idiots like this everywhere in the world. You try to warn them about a danger and they ignore it until it bites them.
One born every minute .
Natural selection at its finest let him be
Darwin.
let darwinism take care of his idiocy
Let evolution sort out the idiots
Darwinning...
Crocodile in the ocean ? Don't he mean shark ?
Thank him for the callout and potentially saving your life mate!! Idiots at large. 🙏🤪
Just let the natural selection do its work.
i don’t remember this episode of bluey
You don’t see bBacks, Asians or jews doing this. Whites, stop having a Deathwish.
Bye Felicia
Mind your business.
If you dress like a poisonous frog, the crocs wont eat you.
Man crocodile Dundee trying to save your life oh well.
Wen an Assy is yelling at you giving some sound advice LISTEN TO IT 😎🇨🇦
Guy's looking to collect his own Darwin Award. Even I'm not that dumb!
Stellar camera work there...
Idk why yt folks think they can go to other countries and bring their American privilege with them 😂 hes no better than that woman who got done by a mama monk seal😂😂😂😂 she ignored all the signs on the beach, the plastic rope, and the natives told her no. She went over there anyway and mama monk seal bit her ahh up. Two guys rescued her goofy ahh. Guess she wanted someone to touch her ahh. But dude is dealing with crocs ? Iz he out of his mind? I cant i really cant with these people😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't say anything just video
When you're in another country  its allways  a awsome idea 💡  to learn about what dangers they have on the land and in the sea and rivers  as for crocodile dum dee over here risking his life thinking  he is steve Irwin  or david attinbraaah  homie good luck 👍  dude 😂😅😭😭😭🫣🤓 ha hahaha ha
He’s right but the tone turns it into an ego battle. Not that it’s his fault but a change of tone to worry, compassion, and humility would make all the difference in the communication.
Is he an American by any chance?
Help him you fool.  Aussies lol
In all fairness, that's terrible advice because how is he going to blame the crocodiles after he gets eaten by it...?🤔
let natural selection take its course mate
Why are we not allowing Darwin to work his magic?
Darwin awards
Yet another candidate for the Darwin award.
Wow ! Scary how visitors don’t do any research 🙄😂
Great camera work.  I really wanted a closeup of the F-ing dock.
Let him win a Darwin award
Ha, the jokes on the australian. There is no such thing as common sense. People either have sense or don't.
What a Mormon!!
Thinks the crocks can see him because his wearing a "special effects" blue suit.
What a schmuck
Let the show begin!
Trust in Darwin and let natural selection do its thing - this guy probably shouldn’t be allowed to reproduce
What’s the big deal if the guy wants to feed the crocodiles let him feed the crocodiles
Remove the warning signs and labels stop helping stupidity and let nature take care of the idoits
“don’t blame the crocodile 🐊 when you’re done by it”   and I’m thinking- how could he blame the crocodile even if he wanted to 😂. I am fairly certain the crocodile’s feelings would stay unharmed
Crocs wondering if Smurfs are edible
Darwin award runner-up contestant
Why i am never going to australia.
Reminds me of Bill Engvall - Here’s Your Sign!
same goes for hawaii.. leave the turtles and seals alone and the natives wont punish you.
Yeah when an aussie is telling you what your doing is dangerous. .. listen to that man
Teletubby
And the Darwin’s Awards goes to…. Papa Smurf 😂
letting natural selection take its course has its benefits, mate
That right there is natural selection
The guy on the board is actually playing it smart. He is fully aware that there are croc warning signs strewn about. But he knows that a croc in the water is a threat that has nothing on an angry Aussie on the shore. If anything, he should be paddling a little more enthusiastically.
Darwin award contestant
What an idiot😂
if he dies, he dies
Your. Good person. I usually just mind my own business
Wild lol. Don't blame the croc is real though
And he’s talking about saltwater Crocs, massive aggressive and hungry
“Mate that’s a crocodile recently seen sign” while our hero furiously paddles through his own misconceptions.
This is called natural selection. Let it take its  course.
Darwin Award nominee
Don't bother warning adults. They will just breed more idiots.
True 👍
Some people are so brain Dead.
You've done what you can mate now let him go collect his Darwin award.
Darwin award candidate.
Have a nice meal crocs
Natura selection
It’s called Darwinism….  Not much you can do to help a creature like that… natural selection and all…
F it letum go lol
Abdoool?
Does this count as a self oof attempt? 😂
Crocs hate the color blue. This man knows what he is doing, mind your business
When the crocodile's dinner is insisting on being eaten, it's rather rude to deny the croc it's meal.
lol florida man on vacay
Let him be..darwinism at its finest
Futher Darwin award winner here.
This is why NOBODY attacks Australia! The wildlife alone would take you out! 😅
I love that these folks have so much respect for the crocs even as they protect themselves from them. They know their habits and understand that they are just acting in their nature and it is up to humans to be cautious when entering their domain.   In the US southeast there is still a lot of hate for Alligators in places and people are always trying to have them removed from golf courses and ponds and the like after building them right on their doorstep
All the people saying if an Australian says “” do it, can’t you hear the Darwin Award nominee is also Australian?  Doesn’t it get cancelled out if you’re also Australian?
His fashion will keep the crocs away, dw.
We should just let Darwinism run its course and slowly but surely society would be good again lol
When an Australian person warns you about dangerous wildlife you better listen 😅
Darwinism
What a serious idiot, the guy trying to save his life😮😢😢😢😢
The crocs are kindly asking you to shut up and let this man be 😂
Wow he may have just saved this man’s life
Good Lord !
So did he get eaten? 😲🏊‍♂️🐊
Let Darwin's theory of evolution work for itself 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ❤️🇦🇺
Dont blame the crocodile when u get done by it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When someone up north says there's a croc around,  then you need to listen.
Dude don't you realise that kids born after 2000 are so much more intelligent than us lot born before are... Facts proved by YouTube.
It’s never the animals fault!!!
Well at least it would help clean up the gene pool. 😂
Mental note when I’m in Australia:  avoid the boat ramps 😗
How have people like him survived for so long! 🤦‍♂️
This is exactly how it feels seeing the idiotic comments on facebook 😂😂😂
Croc: Mind your own business!
The guy preaching is ironically wearing crocs on his feet lol 🤣
Less sense than a Smurf.
I've never been to Australia, but even I know you don't go near the water in North Queensland
Surely this isn't real? It can't possibly be ...
"The darwin award goes to..."
We need people like that so we do not die 😂
You know where you’re at my boy?
Is the guy on the paddle board English? He doesn't sound Australian .
Darwin awards contender,lol
The man is in the running for a Darwin Award.  For his next trick in the competition I hear he's going to poke an angry adult male Red Kangaroo.
His name is normally Bruce..
WHAT A FUKN GOOSE
I’m so glad we just have gators around here. Alligators eat fish so it’s much more rare for them to attack a person but crocs are mainly larger mammal eaters… which is us
Just let them meet darwin.
Natural selection and this man is currently in the lower part of the food chain 😁
When you have 2 locals yelling at you about anything. . . . .  You should probably listen.
This man shooting the video is a bit to close to crocodile infested water for my liking.
Oh well, you tried. what happens is on papa smurf now
But he votes greens. He's immuned from stupidity.
Crocs have to eat too
Where’s the sign? Lololol points to 373783 of them
When you.get done by it
Its the country-British-Australian accent for me
Next Darwin Award winner
Natural selection , don't play with it
Karen over here hassling. Let a man swim in croc water if he wants too
We get those guys in Florida, too. They never listen
Where is the sign, he must be a democrat, so ignorant people.
Only croc I see is on his foot 😂
Always listen to an Australian warning you about crocs, while he's wearing crocs, or you'll end up being worn by crocs.
so...where is part 2 ?
Yes I am fully aware of my situation now show me the sign that says I'm an idiot too please.
There's  an idiot born every day.
"And the winner of this year's Darwin Awards is..."
This is how a lot of floridians are too. They will swim with gator and make pets out of them. Calling them swamp puppies etc🤣
Australian yelling at an Australian?
Geezers an ozzy bro get yaself outta there like he f@#&ing said
If its a hot summer day in australia and your the only person out on the water theres probably a reason for that😂
Darwin award winner right there!!😮😮
Bro I live in the US and have never been there but I know they have crocodiles there.
Leave that f--king idiot alone. Darwinism is quite legal...😂
My armpits stink
Maybe he got that anti croc eating suit from acme co. Just like the roadrunner and coyote used to get all the gadgets and gizmos
It'a buff out
Hey just so you know, you may die from a crocodile cause thsy hang out here  WHERES THE SIGN SAYING CROCODILES ARE HERE HUH!??!?! Wheres the sign????
Darwin Award coming up 🤦‍♂️
I say let him go, population control...
Arguing with a local trying to make sure you don’t die is wild work. Why is he fighting him on this lol what’s wrong with this guy?!? 😂😂😂
Hey Crocs, dinner's ready!!!
What exactly is his “thing”? Paddling on a knee board?
Darwinism at work.
Give the blue Smurf a medal for pure stupidity he wasn’t interested in listening am thinking he want be Smurf bait
Thinning  down the heard by their own choice !!!
How do you as am Ausie or with a working brain from anywhere not know that the whole country is infested with crocks?
Some people’s kids never learned.
Him: I don’t see any crocs. Croc: Comes up from under him, blood everywhere. Man warning him: Well, I tried.
Just leave Darwinism alone. If he survives, fine ..... if not, the gene pool just got stronger
Blue man Group posting they are hiring one position.
Go croc
Typical
This is why I show everyone who visits me in the deep south what snakes are no-no snakes & show them gators in the ponds, so they know what to look out for in our region
Dressed like a blue man nonsense
You just can't tell these Richard Craniums.
Dressed to mimic a seal😂
Let him go, not your problem
"every 6 months some one is torn to pieces by a crocodile" idk which Aussie said it and well I don't doubt it after seeing this
Natural selection!
I cant wait for stimpee to make fun of this guy in a reference in a video or something
Looks like meat’s back on the menu, boys!
But wearing a stinger suit😂😂😂😂
In Cairns harbour!!  In cairns, they crawl up the drains and end up in ur backyard swimming pools!!  Im glad this guy had a good life.  Darwin writing his name on the Awards list as we speak!!
Natural selection I say. 😂Crocodile food😅
In Queensland on a board...I'd be more worried about a shark mistaking me for a seal on the surface (their vision below and the shadow and shape makes a person on a board look like the shape and silhouette of a seal and that is the Great White's preferred meal)
"Where is the sign?"  This isnt about signs or fines man, its about not gettong eaten.
Croc-bait sounds like either Aussie or Kiwi 😆. Im a kiwi😅
This nugget earns a sign on his forehead, IDIOT!
Is there the full video ?
Survival of the fittest. Smh dude has zero common sense.
Unbelievable that someone would argue with someone who is trying to save their life! Defines society really 😱
He's obviously on vacation!!! Don't you know that tourist know everything about places they've never been 😅
He’s crazy
florida man doesnt care bout no crocodile they eat them for lunch cause breakfast is reserved for chickens
Natural selection will take care of that one.
How about a HUGE SIGN CROCODILES DON'T GO IN THE WATER!
You can't save morons.
Arguing with people who are trying to save your life. Is as human as it gets.
Eh jam off let dude do what he wants to do
If a local warns you.  Heed it
STOP TELLING ME NOT TO BE CROCODILE SNACKS
Common sense left that IDIOT at the dock
Chewy blue mmmm
That guy’s gotta be crazy on that toothpick with crocodiles are you kidding me? 😂
Just let nature be nature, to many dumbdumbs weakening the genepool
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish Australians could just have the guns they need to protect themselves in the outdoors.
Old man arguing 😂😂😂
Never try and tell an idiot not to be an idiot 😅😅
And so far no remains of the body have been found!
Smart man trying to get his family the insurance money ignoring the signs and the people warning him should nullify the life insurance claim ?
Why bother nature mate, let it takes its course. 😂 youre taking food off the croc's table 🤦🏻
Insurance fraud
I adore Aussies but not their crocs!😅
"And the Darwin Award goes to..."
LET HIM WIN THE DARWIN AWARD 😂
Ppl are so brain dead 😮😮😮😢😢😢😢  i pray for his soul.
I love a nature movie called natural selection 😂😂
When an Aussie says get outta the water you better get out of the water.
Don't blame the crocodile when you get ""DONE BY"" ... my favorite saying today
Bleeding idiot.
Natural selection at its best 😂
Thinning the herd.
Lol, goes for idiots in Florida or Louisiana doing the same.🐊
I travelled the circumference of Australia over a two year period   me and me missus swam everyday anywhere everywhere day or night, never a stinger suit, sometimes wet suit, predominantly hunting our next meal whilst enjoying the spectacle of ocean reefs, mangrove systems, drop off's, marine life large and small, jellyfish, sharks, crocs, whales, turtles, dolphins, and of course all they birds and birds of prey.  All the while not realising the many dangers and risks both in or out of the water😊 However I did find all around, everyone is aware of these dangers, let me say EXTREMELY aware  Probably a drop over dramatic and dramatised, with danger signs everywhere, people just look at the water, but not swim it😊 Somehow Aussies are afraid of everything in nature and oceans  apart from the Aboriginals and me and me missus 😅😂😅😂 true I KNOW BIG STATEMENT I love you Aussies can always throw out a joke and take a joke😅😂😅❤
Survival of the fittest, disposal of the thickest.
Bro’s already recordin, just relax and be quiet 😂
Darwin Contestant. Let him compete.
All that splashing , you are about to be a feast for crocs.
I mean if it is not the crock is the great white shark or the box jellyfish...
Like we say in Memphis"go for it mane"
I JUST saw a show on YT the other day where a mother and her two boys went on vacation, and the resort where they stayed were UNAWARE of a huge crocodile "gang" in the water. Two boys had gone through an open gate near the area where the resort provided things for kids to do. The boys were playing with a hose, spraying it around, and a croc jumped up and grabbed a boy!!! Some of the people staying there came running, and they jumped in the water and fought off the croc!!!!! The boy was injured pretty bad but survived
Love the australian accent 😅
This blokes gone tropo
Dont blame the croc when ya get done by it....😂
I would’ve told him “fine do what you want, but you’re on your own when the crockers come for you”… “I’ll be over there…. Watching” 😂
Me: *Trying to help someone not get hurt or die* Person: “how dare you”
I'm going to assume the conversation started more civilly.
He's got two brain cells left and they are both fighting for second place.
Actually he's probably in more danger from box jelly fish which is why he's wearing a body stocking!
What he’s really saying is “no one’s gonna be a hero and drag you and your stumpy legs out of the water.”
Your camera work blows, however, you probably save a life
Aussie version of Go play jn in the road mate
The only crocs I see are on his feet
Ignorance isn't always bliss 🙄
Some people are born as crash dummies...at this point let crocky 🐊 have a bite😅
That kneeboard is even lamer than a paddle board 😂😂😂
Oh no by all means go ahead
This is a candidate for the Darwin Awards!!!
Don't get in the way of natural selection
Darwin award in preparation
I love how an mans ego can blind him totally for reason.
Killjoys, where's the footage of the carnage.
That is absolutely true because even here in Miami the crocs hang out at every boat ramp!! We've had several peaple bitten and one death recently!!!
The guy is a local helping you, you potato head. North QLD= crocs ALL AUS= swim between flags (rips and currents) South East coast = don’t fish off wet rocks (you will be swept away) Tourists still don’t read the signs or listen.
Thats like asking the Woke libs to not be insane!!!
Survival of the fittest at this point 😂
What a donkey 😂
Ah, the Darwin awards in action 😂
How you gonna ask for evidence then deny it because you don’t like it
Leave dude alone man crocs gotta eat too
Just hunkered over while hand paddling along slowly looking like an easy meal.
I cannot explain how humorous it is for an aussie to be yelling so casually.
Don't interrupt someone when they are trying to earn a darwin award, just let them help humanity.
This is how crocodile attacks usually happen, yes people don't read signs or they do and just don't care. These days getting views and likes is more important than life and its sad
Give the blue bell end a Darwin Award! 🥇
Crocs were afraid of his stupidity
He's scaring the crocs
“Yeah, righto”
Imagine being offended by someone trying to save your life...
That’s why we won’t last as long as crocodiles
Darwin award 👏
WHAT AN IDIOT!
Is that what they call "The Darwin Effect?" Lol
Let him go and he gonna find out 💩
Common sense no more
Natural selection
When an AUSSIE tells you to have common sense. You should immediately go home and rethink your life.
If someone warned me about deadly animals in a body of water I was in, I would thank them for about 40 minutes.
That guy RIP
Nobody dressed like that has a lick of sense.
AND.... Looks like dude even has Croc on too🤣😂 🫡
Can you imagine the nerve of that guy? Denying Crocs and sharks free meals? There ought to be a law.
🐊💀
Why is that idiot ignoring a Queenslander??
Sassy yelling at Scruffy to get out the water
You can't help those who are idiots!
Potential Darwin Award Champion in the making
Darwin Award goes to…
Here just for the comments 😂
To be honest everyone what's the issue here with some mild disagreement. I can understand why both don't want to mess around in each other's business because it doesn't benefit anyone. It's human nature and thanks guys ❤️
People need to mind their business
A Darwin Award candidate.
People that blame animals for their stupidity is trash.
That's how Aussies show concern. A warning and an insult at the same time 😂
Idiots tend to double down when you point out their ignorance.
Just let nature do its thing.
It’s just the blue man group paddling out to the site of their next music video, don’t bother em, respect the art lol.
This is a perfect example of how to communicate with people. You don't have to be rude when warning someone, talking about "have some common sense"...etc. That's why he's resisting, because of the rudeness of the warning.
Apparently crocodiles only appear whete there are signs of their presence
If he dies in that goofy, blue, wetsuit, they'll be his ghost clothes for eternity!
When an Aussie is losing his cool over You, you are basically dead, but your brain hasn't registered it yet.
Funny thing about salt water crocs is that theyre one of the few known animals that actively try to hunt humans instead of attacking by mistake or self defense.  Tldr: people are on its menu.
And the Darwin award goes too!!!!
Future Darwin award winner
…and he was never heard from again. Good on ya’, mate.
A Darwin Award winner right there
Temporary human
The process of natural selection 😂😂
Who tf cares
Leave the liberal to do his thing. Pronouns are taste treat
When we visited North Queensland, from our boat we saw a massive dino croc swimming in the ocean. It actually looked peaceful. I stuck to the hotel pool for the whole holiday though. Have to respect their habitat.
Same here in Florida. I would never swim in any pond ,lake or river here.  They are full of Gators, Snapping turtles and venomous snakes.
Future Darwin Award Winner 😅😊
Dude is casually paddle boarding in my worst nightmare
The crocodile didn't make the signs visible enough, therefore by law it's not allowed to eat him.
Yup we have the same problem with Yankees in Florida alligators hang out at ramps because fishermen clean their fish there and toss parts to gators SUP riders sashay by not a care in world
You definitely wouldn’t have to tell me twice.
Something i noticed on my visits to Australia.. they will unabashedly yell at you for all kinds of  reasons.. 😅
Puts on sting suit... Swims with crocs 😅
As a Florida man im really not shocked someone would venture into reptile infested waters, i grew up swimming with these beasts myself lol.
The local said his piece, now we just let natural selection do its thing.
This guy just saved that idiots life
Obviously there's no crocs there otherwise they just snatched him up
If Crocodile Dundee tells you to watch out for crocs, watch out for crocs. Seems pretty simple.
"my client never asked to be saved, my client didn't want to be saved!"
I’m just saying when the most country people in the whole world are saying you’re being dumb that’s saying something. My Ausie friends are the biggest rednecks I know.
Don’t worry mate, the man has got a Tele tubby suit on for protection.😅
Let him be natural selection.
Survival of the fittest    Let Darwinism sort it out
"where's the sign" what so you can sue the crocodile for biting you?
When we lived in Mississippi we’d see people down by the water (all water) and they’d see an alligator and get within 10-15 feet to take selfies of themselves with an alligator swimming off the bank or laying on boat docks I was from Idaho and even I knew better and I’d never seen an alligator except in the zoo IDIOTS EVERYWHERE
Yea have some common sence!
Natural selection will take place with this one I'm sure
Common sense is not very common with that guy 😅
If he wants to be a telly tubby... fair dinkum
It’s called natural selection.
IDIOT IDIOT big mouth IDIOT
Let nature take its course. The world doesn't need fools like this
Saltwater crocs
You just cant help some people nowadays ...
Yup that Teletubbie is dead 💀 😂😂😂
I mean the guy did say I'm fully aware of what I'm doing & if he does that's on him
jus let nature take its course.  we have enough of those guys in the gene pool already.
Which would you rather see a Salty or a White?
Let him go. I'm so tired of society having to deal with these idiots who don't believe their actions have consequences. That guy drives and votes most likely and that should be a problem for everyone near him
He's a Darwin Award contender. Leave him be.
He’s a big fish 🐟 lol😂😂😂
He’s also a aussies . Leave him alone mate
Why interrupt a Darwin moment?
I will just swim in a swimming pool thank you
Stop harassing Papa Smurf
The fool is definitely King these days🤬🤯
Let the guy do what he wants. You can't argue with thick tw@s
Darwin award waiting to happen. And rightfully so
hey! let him do something that will leave him disabled or worse! he clearly wants to play the victim so stop trying to save his life!  in the words of a little tw@t “how dare you”
Sometimes…. When help is given.. they tend to ignore or continue on with their stupidity…. No wonder aliens are hiding away😅
He's fully aware of the fact that he has no facts, no brains, and a set of blinkers that could calm a yearling in the Melbourne Cup, but at least the horse knows where the signs are 😂
Sky News reports man in QueensLand suing crocodile for ripping off his legs
We have to let darwinism do what nature intended and quit keeping people alive that shouldn't be that's what's wrong with the world.
Darwin is in the background somewhere, peaking around a eucalyptus tree 😂
Cleanse the gene pool! Leave him alone.
Bell end
The entire continent is a death trap.  Crocs aren't anywhere near the worst thing you can stumble across.
Ffs … just warning him about danger.
Is that a Croc deliver roo ? 😂😂😂
Just wondering , Is her Dead? 🥴
He's got a stinger suit on. He's protected from crocs 😂😂😂
Please show us part 2 of Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection...
I wanna see part 2 where there's a red spot in the water and the locals saying to each other, "we told him so"
Darwin
Beyond!:! Idocey.
Some people just don’t like it when you tell them common sense! You’re only trying to save his life, but he doesn’t really care so let him go.
Natural selection. Let him go, you tried. Literally gotta argue with someone to save their life.   Humanity has de-evolved
if some australian dude tells you not too, i think you should listen
He will not be missed
Darwin doing its thing...no tears shed. 🤷‍♂️
Leave the guy be and just keep filming so we can all see him win the Darwin award
North Queensland mate. Where’s is that? Somewhere in the Louisiana bayou?
Why is he mad? That are trynna save him from himself
For some reason there are different opinions and no one is attacking each other nice
We need tourists because crocks have to eat as well 😮
The amount of Americans in these comments who cannot comprehend the difference between an American Crocodile and one of the deadliest animals on the planet the Saltwater Crocodile. (Not in America)
When a bloke tells u there’s crocs in that water, you better listen
Don't mess with Saltys
For anyone without kids  This is what it’s like dealing with kids lol
What a knacker
Come to the us once it won’t seem crazy 😂
Guy is such an idiot 😂😂
Dang! at first I thought the shadow was a croc under water
Aussies were always telling this suburban American how not to die when I was passing through the outback, using the roughest words.  I listened to every word.
How dare you interfere with Darwinism?
i mean, if someone is that stopid, let evolution take its course ..
Mind your business
Australians would be terrified to walk in there front yard in florida then 😂
Tourist: so what’s a good place to eat? Local man: oh family own restaurant down the street, been here for decades!  Tourist: McDonald’s it is!
Kroc Karen and Darren
Leave him alone we need some new action content 🐊
I would have just said “whelp I tried to help” and walk away
Let him go
If a local tells you to get out of the water then get the Fck out!
Darwin... Survival of the fittes😂😂😂😅😢😊
I need closure on this.
You can't help some people 😅
Let’s ignore they guy that knows the area
I would be running on top of that water to get out!!!
What, does he think is he an invincible teletubbie??
Darwin0
Natural selection at work 😂
Did he get out alive
Arguing about "where's the sign" like he can sue the Croc later for there not being big enough signs.
😮😮😮😮😮
Imagine having to argue with someone about not getting themselves killed by a croc. 🤔🤣🤣🤣
“Show me a well placed sign, and i’ll show you 100 people that’ll ignore it”
If an Aussie is telling u something is dangerous, you’re already dead.
dude I've see Australian casually grab snakes from their toilet and swimming pools and take them out with the trash. when they tell you to stay away from something, you're probably already too close to even make it out
My friend and I jumped in the water in Louisiana a man ran up and said get out there are alligators. We got out immediately.  Never saw an alligator in the water here.  Lesson learned.
Bro trying to find final peace in this life and you out here hassling him. Let him find his way out and let the croc get a meal.
I'm an American and this twit sounds like an arrogant American!
Crocs bellies matter to 😂😂😂😂😂
The ego is huge
I'm an American east coast surfer, and there's no way in hll I'm getting in the water in Queensland, only going where the locals are because the saltwater crocodile is the scariest animal on the planet in my opinion
What a tool
lol I wouldn’t get in a bath in oz never mind the sea or a river
Blue cosplay
Just let the nature take its course
I never understood why people go kayaking and paddle boarding in Australia and Florida
Natural selection.
The American equivalent to this is someone from California paddle boarding in Florida.
GET OUT OF THE WATER!
Stupidity kills 🙄
I guess he wasn’t fully aware 😬
The guys a Chad he doesn't care for you beta local opinion
Ignorance is bliss, I guess.
The man is giving him good advice but he thinks that he knows better
Ahh, so sad. He did not get his Darwin Award.
Guy on the knee board is a Chad
I think the majority of missing people worldwide owned a kayak.
Definitely a NQ accent and lingo.
Natural selection at its finest 😂
Sharks and crocs nope
Please stop interfering with natural selection.
Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by him.
"Let me do my thing"... getting eaten by a salt water crocodile... 😂😂😂
I mean it would’ve be kinda rad to see some Darwin Awards being handed out. 😅
Yeah listen to the wise man. He's not telling you what to do just don't be shocked or bawl for help when you're done by .geesh some folks lack any sense let alone common
They're probably salt water crocks too.
And the Darwin award 2024 goes to...
This fool doesn't even appreciate this vital information!😮
British in the water …
Well we will probably  see him on the news. No brains and happy without them .
Not even worth saying anything. Natural selection just working its course.
It's the first thing on the Australia brochure all the deadly animals?
What’s the argument against “there are crocodiles in the water “?
NATURAL SELECTION
Superhero in Blue suit will fight all Cross! 😮
I’m not even an Australian but it must get very frustrating because I see videos like this constantly.
Just let nature run it's course . We really need to remove warning labels
Karens gotta be Karens no matter the situation. Let the dude be. If a croc gets him so what. Does he owe you money or something
After saying there's crocodiles in the water in this area, you shouldn't have to waste your breath any longer. Just enjoy your day
Some people have to do things the hard way. 🐊
Freaking Karen's everywhere lol 😂
Needed that laugh mate
I just watched several times to make sure it wasn’t an American. I didn’t know crocs were a problem near the ocean until relatively recently. I can read a sign though… Hope they survived!
Always one absolute fool
Let nature take its course 😵
Does the man get out of the water?
Imaging getting mad & someone trying to warn you that you might get eaten 😂😂
Did he get eaten?
As an aussie, just dont go in water that other people arent in haha 😂 thats your sign
Paddling with his hands too like heeere fishy fishyyy 😅
How is that a fun thing to do
The Aussie's NEVER say nothing so when one does you ought to listen. How you si fkn mad cause they don't want YOU to die??
Weres the sign ...it's around your neck dude
A snack
Dont blame the crocodile... can we have more common sense like this
Just film the meal
I didn't know a crocodile can't attack you unless there's a sign up. Must be like inviting a vampire into your home
Natural selection at play there🙈
I love how they say the word mate
Their deep Ausie accent makes this interaction more interesting 😂
Let me be lunch bro stay out of it😅😂
Leave the barstard there.
Would be nice to see the sign and not just stare at the boat ramp
Why does he look like someone's gimp has escaped?
😮😂😂🇨🇦
And this year's Darwin award goes to.....
Crocodile Dundee is warning you. Be careful mate.
If the dude didnt warn rhem. The crocodiles plans were exposed.   Lucky for the silly one on the board. If u were alone you were dead until the aussie dude warned you. Making it slightly less attractive to a croc.   But lol. Chances are every croc goes for you lol! 3 makes it worse.  No way they lived
Let natural selection take its course
There's no telling some people. 😂
And this year Darwin Award  goes to down under😂 finally someone besides an American 😂😂
You’re in North Queensland mate 😂😂🤦🏼‍♂️
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah have some common sense and learn how to take a video!
Shhhh.... let evolution happen
Watching the "last moment of x" video are we?
First mistake is assuming anyone has common sense now a days
Nice folks trying to keep someone safe & not let crocs get a bad reputation
He'll be up for a Darwin Award. What an idiot.
"you didn't save my life, you ruined my death"!
DARWIN AWARD WINNER IN THE MAKING 😂
Duhhhhhh....
I believe him just with that accent 😂
I'm guessing his girl cheated.
Ive seen so many people get super defensive when other people care about them.
He got to the level he's at by not listening. It will take more than your concerned words, signs, and passers-by chiming in to change his mind.
Mind your own business mate
This year, at least two people were eaten by Crocs here. Last year, a fisherman was in his 2-meter dinghy fishing, and a Croc smashed it and ate him.  So this man doesn't even stand a chance!
If you dont care what he does why are you posting a video of it?
Natural Selection works fine. Just keep recording,,
No, don’t listen to the locals warning you about crocodiles. Just go about your business and tell them to do the same.  Real smart buddy.  “FOR SALE “ - paddle board slightly used. Has slight damage from teeth marks.
Natural selection
Moments later the Smurf was bumped off his board and torn to pieces by 3 hungry crocs. 😵
It's funny he's wearing crocs while warning about the crocs! 🤣
I guess the blue suit paddler decided to jump the queue for common sense.
I don't think crocodiles eat blue fish
…thinning the herd….
Croc: Ugh! Leave our lunch alone.
Natural selection
Let him be. He is grown
He is mad that they are trying to save his life…go figure
Why does everyone feel the need to hold up a phone before talking to someone…. and think anything they have to say is gonna be taken without hostility…?
Natural selection!
If this isnt a sign that some people have a death wish I dont know what is
People really need to mind their own business and let nature take its course.
If a local Australian tells you not to paddle in that water ,get out as fast as you can.😂😂😂😂
They hang around waiting for fish.....and dummies like this.
DUMB PEOPLE FEEDTHEMSELVES TO WILD ANIMALS ITS NATURES WAY OF KEEPING THE POPULATION IN CHECK ✅
😂😂😂😂😂💩
The most dangerous thing to a man is false confidence
I wouldn't argue with him.... gotta learn
He's doing it for views
Common sense ain't so common is it now !!!!
After the attack “why would crocodiles do this?”
Darwinism in practice! lol Bye Bye Poppa Smurf!
Liberals think their feelings trump reality 😂😂😂😂
Its a miracle this man has made it to the age hes at now 😂
3 locals on a jetty warned me the jetty I was walking down with my dive gear and spear gun was infested by sharks. But I figured I knew better and walked down the jetty and started shooting fish. Got chased out of the water by 4 very aggressive sharks. Listen to the locals
😂 no survival instinct
My friend named Jack hopped a fence around a small Lake in Florida ,pulled up his pants took of his shoes and was wading in the water fishing, he felt the presence of somebody behind him he turned and looked and it was an old man with a pipe in his mouth, he greeted the old man by saying" how you doing old timer" the old man replied" let me guess you're from the north down here on vacation" Jack replied "I am how did you know?" The old man replied" cuz only a Yankee would be dumb enough to be standing in that water with all those alligators"😂
Common, let the guy be 😂😂😂
The statement “you’re in North Queensland mate, have some common sense” has so many potential applications.
The man trying to warn him is interfering with the natural selection.
When more than one person tells you a fact and then both of those people can be corroborated with a posted sign you should not do the thing that they're trying to tell you to not do
The devil keeps his pets in Australia. Please listen to the locals 😂😂
Darwinism at work.
This dude is a multitude of dumbassedness.
Charles Darwin's Natural Selection in action...
If he is attacked by a crocodile, he should definitely tell the croc  to leave and let him do his things xD
Darwin would be so proud.
If someone is trying to tell you that you are in danger of being eaten by a crocodile then you should really thank him instead of arguing about it. Idiot. This is the problem with society. Too proud to admit they are in the wrong.
NOT fully aware😮
natural selection
Typical.. lived in the African bush and used to walk the dogs by the mangroves bay. Dogs bath only not myself. But met tourists one day and they wanted to swim.. Told them I wouldn’t bc no one knows what s in. They laughed and said they are “ used” to swim in the wild..  ok.  Heard the next day by locals that fishermen had to take one out bc he was stung by something in the water. A snake.. Don’t know what happened to him. Just know he went to the hospital.
Some people don’t know how to video. Why would you point it down to the concrete?
A man wearing crocs is warning others about crocs.   But who will warn him?
Just let natural selection be natural
As soon as i heard the accent, i started to pay attention to the directions . Because if a guy like that talks to you. Its for a reason 😅.
DARWIN awards
Darwin nominee
Wont catch me in a boat or anything in no waters with crocodiles
Man vs croc 🐊 croc wins
That dude thought he was getting made fun of until the other guy said “fine go test the crocodiles”...   Oh “righto” that’s what your saying
This dude is dipping his hands in saltwater crocodile infested waters.. let natural selection happen.. I live in America, I wouldnt dip a toe anywhere in Australia. Theyre a different breed of people 😂
Krikey!😂
Nah bro, let natural selection do its thing
Give Darwinism a chance. If he/they wants to swim with crocodiles, good luck to you.
Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it 😂😂
Ah just let him be bait
So... Natural Selection/Darwin Award
You do you😂😂😂
Soon as he said crocodile I woulda been...... CROCODILE!!!!!!!!
But think of the YouTube video you will have of a Smurf on a sawn off surfboard being eaten by a crocodile
Warn him once, twice then sit back and watch another defective gene be removed from the gene pool.
He is fully aware that there are crocodiles in the water 😂😂😂 seems he signed off his papers to leave this world.
You can’t argue with some ppl.  They know best regardless of logic.
Aussie man meets his first Florida man
I’m from nsw. I’d never get in north qld waters. Common sense ppl .
Darwin award winner to be.
I would definitely recommend listening to him
Why’s he look like a color blind green screen worker,
Say hello to crocodile for me
Let them get darwin awards maybe voting will go differently xD
Born to die young
Lol fken buddy
Dude tried to win a posthumous Darwin Award... 🤦🏻‍♀️
"Where's the sign"???!!
let the herd thin itself.  the worlds intelligence level will rise.
Stop warning folks
He's looking for his Darwin Award !!
Crocodiles gotta get fed to i guess lol
Leave him to it ..who cares,  he is an idiot
Why I will never visit Australia. I understand why most Aussie friends move to New Zealand now ☺😅
Gives meaning to Gator bait 😮😮
When Florida Man meets Australia man….
This is the kind of guy that I laugh at when I see the story on go fund me. He's also the reason I don't believe in free Healthcare.
A Blue-bite on a board!
Av been done guys I’ve been done by the bladdy crokkodoile🤣🤣
Natural selection
Darwin award goes to Papa Smurf 🎉
Idiot
Croc 1 that human is stooopid just like every other human we ate Croc 2: thank God for stooopid humans as we won't be around today Croc 3: you can Mos of th8s guy. The last guy I ate clothes gave me hectic constipation with his swim suite
Well, apparently, he’s not from Australia that’s too funny. Don’t blame the croc when you get eaten by it. 😂😂😂😂
Natural Selection at this point. At least he’ll go out in style, that’s the most touristy looking dude I’ve seen in a minute.
Well, apparently, he’s not from Australia that’s too funny. Don’t blame the croc when you get eaten by it. 😂😂😂😂
lol he’s still saying “yea right” 😂
He kind of reminds me of all those people that voted for the Democrats. In spite of all the warnings...
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it."  He won't be able to blame anything once the crocodile comes.
The second he started talking back i wouldve shut up and kept the camera rolling let darwin take over
There has to be a part 2. Where can I find it?
I think if you want to have someone listen to you and not be defensive the worst way to go about it is to point a camera at them…  Conversely, if your actual real goal is NOT to save someone but just to humiliate them then the BEST way to go about it is to point a camera at them where they will act defensively and make a further a** out of themselves…
I'm sure he'll be fine why you bothering everyone
Look at what this yelling man is wearing for shoes, it is priceless!
Go ahead! Do NOT blame the crocodiles!!!!!!
This is how i felt when i moved to florida. I was driving to work and notice a alligator in the little lake, then a few days later i seen people swimming in it. I didnt get into any water but the ocean, the entire 4 years i lived there
Leave him there he’ll find out the hardware
I’m an American who grew up watching documentaries about salt water crocodiles. Don’t know how anyone would swim in water they couldn’t see the bottom of when in the northern part of the country.
The croc eats him instead of someone else
Story time;  Once in backwoods florida we found a cool old bridge over the intracostal, perfect for jumping.   This old fisherman gets mad, tells us we must have a death wish with the debris under there, we figured he was mad we were gonna scare his fish.   I jumped first and something cut my hand about 10 feet under the water on the way down, opened my eyes and i was in an underwater rebar forest, lucky to not be impaled.  Rushed up to the surface, just in time to stop the next jumper from likely dying.   Old man's all "told you youngins i didn't want to have to drag your corpse out but y'all just don't LISTEN"  LISTEN TO THE LOCALS
Most people would have just started recording.
What an idiot.
This is crazy you gotta know about the water your in before you get in it like is it safe am I suppose to be in it and whag else is in it
The lady came in like the neighbors of Katt in that episode of ATL "yes he do got an alligator. Thats the alligator man."
I personally wouldn’t go in any water anywhere in Australia. Everything in that country wants to end you
Ah, another Darwin Award contender.. I'd just be sitting in a chair with a drink in one hand, a camera in the other...😅😂
Spawn of Colonizing criminals… go figure , mate
The fact that people need signs is a bad sign. Just be aware of nature wherever you are. I don’t need a deer crossing sign to know a deer is gonna jump out in front of My vehicle.
Theres a shark in the watah
I have so many questions.
Let the SUPER IDIOT BE.....!!! 😱🤮😱🤮😱
This is the same type of person that goes near fresh bodies of water in Florida and thinks that there aren't alligators in it, while standing right next to the "danger! Alligators. No swimming" sign.
The crock has a bib, knife, & fork, & is waiting for you to paddle over.
People nowadays tryna to protect me from crocodiles, you can’t even swim with crocodiles these days. 🤦🏻
Looks like a Florida tourist. 😂  "wait, there's gators in the waters? There's sharks in the ocean?"  Common sense doesn't exist anymore 😂😂😂😂  I cannot tell you how many people I've had to run over to and yell at them because they have sharks swimming around their children playing in the waves unattended 🤦‍♀️ And then, they want to blame the sharks, crocs and gators when they are attacked 😅
Ahhh, yes, Darwinism at its best
a new candidate for the Darwin Award
Does everything in Australia want to either bite you or eat you ?
Prob British 😂😂
Why try to save everyone if the world is so overpopulated?
No those people are wrong. Crocs are the most friendly animals out there and they most definitely love belly rubs 😆
Dumb💩!     🤪  🐊
Common sense?
Man is gonna turn into a statistic
Natural Selection !
Pretty sure that's my father-in-law😂
Camera man fail
The only crocs spotted are the ones he’s wearing 😂
Thats xqc
Idiot
You warned him now let natural selection take over
I love that the filmer is wearing Croqs
Some people are just destined for short lives and there’s not much you can do about it
“When you get done by it” gotta love the Aussie phrases.!.!!
I didn’t think that the person who they have to print Do Not Eat labels on Silica Gel Packets for, would wear a blue suit but I guess you learn something new every day….
He’s from Florida he’s not worried about it
If he would of told me a croc was in that water i wound of been out so fast istg😂😂😂😂
Arrogance or Confidence guy says "I'm fully aware.." ..  Me: *walks away and shrugs my shoulders* i tried to tell him
I grew up swimming and skiing year round in alligator infested bayous, rivers, and ponds of Southeast Louisiana ( Honey Island ).   We saw alligators everywhere we swam, but figured they would leave us alone, and we never swam at night. I wouldn't do it nowadays as they seem to have become more aggressive. But alligators ain't crocs!
Let natural selection take place and walk away
Darwin Award goes to……..
It’s called natural selection!!!
Did the crocs eat him though? I home the crocs had a full meal that day
It's called natural selection mate
😂😂😂😂 this made my day! RIP Smurf
Stubborn Na'vi vacationing in Australia devoured by local croc 👹
Did the croc get him?
Natural selection 😂😂😂😂
Natural selection
I really want to know how this ends
Yea nah, if the Aussie is scared, I'm out
Can’t quite grasp the accent of the guy on the board? Is it another Australian? If so you would think they would know better!
Don't blame the crocodile !! 👏👏👏
Natural Selection at its finest.
Ohhh s*** hes in Cairns😅😂 Bro that is the most silly thing you could do, those waters are INFESTED withs crocs, there are so many that its common place to see them in your backyard pool or in the street on the way to work. You might as well dangle a chunk of beef in the water to take it all the way ya DINGBAT 😂😂
“where’s the sign”   *points out three different signs* 💀
Man I would have ran an got a chair an popcorn an enjoyed the ongoing live documentary about the Australian salty an human interactions.
Wow!,hard to believe. I hope he listened
Warning people about Crocs... In Crocs
Its cool guys, crocodiles can't see the color blue.
Like talking to a Democrat
If a man with an Australian accents tells me to get out of the water… I’m getting out tf water😂😂😂😂😂
The man warning him is wearing Crocs
Darwin will handle this😂
That's Sassy, he's done it heeps of time. Fuken druggo
You carry on mate FAAFO
Hahahahah! He is waiting to be the lunch
Send the video to the authorities so they dont waste resources trying to save him
Did he survive ?
Imagine getting eaten alive wearing that
Harris supporter
Natural selection
ready to earn the Darwin Award
I think he’s earned the right to go out however he wants. Leave him alone 😂😂
Insane
Another Darwin Award contender....
The dude on the board is an ignorant d*ck.  He was warned!  Darwinism at its finest! 🙄
What a ignorant old man
Ugh probably one of my fellow entitled Americans 🙃
Sassy the sasquatch, iz that you?
I pity the crocs that are going to get food poisoning from this dude.
This is one of those people you look at and genuinely wonder how they made it to this age without dying yet. 🥴🥴🥴
All the hungry Crocs: “Yeah do your thing and let him do his thing you party pooper 😋”
Well someone is going to have a big lunch 😅😅😅
Crazy people
Let the man get his Darwin Award 😂
No point in arguing with idiots, natural selection will take care of it eventually
Nature saying “it’s okay you tried, now it’s mh turn, the news will have to say the truth”
Crocs are in for a feast.
Typical…
In the US you can stop an idiot like that...declare him a danger to himself or others....in California it's 5150wic
Maybe let him know without sounding like a complete tool
"Well, what happened was, is I was on the Blue Man Group reunion tour cruise, and Im blue and in need of a guy.."
Isn't Darwin in northern Australia?   Maybe a Darwin award candidate?
Darwin Award seeker.
😂😂😂
if for me....just warn it one time...then if he doesn't listen.....well...Mr Croca Dile gonna have bbq at the back of his house .......😂😂😂😂
Why do you care Let darwinism do its thing
Arguing with idiots is a waste of time
Floridians on vacation in other countries 😂😂😂😂
Solo on a little boogey board SPLASHING around.........some ppl just be asking for it
I call this a case of natural selection at work.
All the idiot on the knee board needs to say is thank you. Instead he argues with a local trying to warn him about ignoring three warning signs.
Did the croc get him?
I can't imagine having even the Aussies telling me that I'm being too dangerous and still ignoring them. Also, guaranteed all of the people who warned him stayed close enough to watch when he ignored them.
Bet the fool would want someone to jump in and save him. Give 5mins 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Darwinism. Sadly though when he does die his family is going to cry and mourn and they're going to say that the Queensland didn't do enough to warn people about the crocodiles and it's not his fault is everybody else's fault but his fault. People who put themselves in danger should be charged when other people try to warn them of the danger and they don't listen and then something bad happens their family should be charged for the stupidity that they raised.
He said hes fully aware leave him be
Tourist lunch
An those croc are very big like 15 - 20 feet that guys crazy💀
I bet he is a cyclists! Croc could save some poor driver having to clean his brains of their bumper
Papa smurf from temu 🫣
Trumper who diesnt listen smh
Why do we even need this individuales to be alive ?
Crocks can't see blue but even if they could, they can only see humams if they stand still.  But seriously isn't anywhere 5,000 miles from Tazmania basically a, "make sure you have a local with you" zone.
I agree with the last comment but it didn’t seem like he was starting to believe them more and more as they went on about it! Hopefully he made it out safe
All these illegals out of their element. He was probably caught stealing pets for food, and thought he'd try earning his dinner instead.
Soon to be a, "crocodile recently seen eating human flesh" sign
Mind ur own business!!!
Dont worry he wont have a chance to blame the crocodile because he will be swirling inside the ocean 💀
What a goof.
Drago voice “if he dies he dies”
Just kidding, mate. There aren’t any sharks. The crocodiles ate all the sharks!
Ah natural selection at work once again
In Cairns... 🤣🤣 Grief. A small amount of googling would have avoided this anywhere north of Yeppoon is super sketchy.
This is man is achieving new heights in the realm of stupidity. Truly a display of absolute dedication.
We need to stop interfering with natural selection
Ya aint frahm around heahrr ahr yah botty?
The guy on the paddleboard is exactly the same person who will sue their local city and government for not preventing him from getting bit by a crocodile. What a numbskull.
Let him make his thing.....😉
Is the guy in the Smurf suit from the US?
If he wants to win a Darwin award SO bad...let him.
Crocs don't like blue didn't you know?
Thus always is a matter of Darwin
Never argue with an idiot, they will only try and bring you down to thier level
"...But dont blame the Crocodile when you get done by it" has to be the most Australian thing ive ever heard 😂
Salties. Yeah, even here in the States, people are wary of gators, and the few crocs that we have. But a giant Salty? No freaking thanks. Steer clear.  And by the way, please send your ship, the HMS Endeavour, back here for a visit. Ha.  I spent time sail training on that incredible vessel, when it sailed up our East Coast.  Cheers...
Here we can see natural selection at werk
Leave him be..he'll find out.
This guy deserves a Darwin Award
Call the authorities
Let him go! This is what Darwin spoke on!!
Nominee for the Darwin Award
You would never truly understand the size of a salty
I would be out of there so fast
Effin brill ... the guy has a mission to become croc plankton 😂
RIP😅😅😅
Well the crocodiles have to eat something.
Look ma! A wild retar-
I wanna see the sequel !
Obviously mental actions not words. He's messed up in his head.
potential darwin award there what a shame
People in Australia are so nice with a mean presentation. 😂
Lol man said don't blame the crocodile when you die
Give that man a Darwin Award.
Don’t blame the crocodile!
So, did the croc 🐊 get him? 😮
DEFINITION OF ~NOT~ FULLY AWARE. 😮 😂
One of the biggest problems today is ego Causes so many problems.  Nobody wants to listen anymore.  There is one point of view ....theirs ...and that's it
Don’t blame the 🐊 when u get done by it😂😂😂
Darwanism at its finest !!!!!!!!!!
I would be finding myself a folding chair and a frosty cool adult beverage and wait for the show to begin! 😮  Who didn’t see that coming? I guess he didn’t? 😮
The parents of this blue guy should be held accountable for failing to fulfill their responsibilities.
Did he die?
Never interfere with Darwinism
Shameful thing is he probably already reproduced.
Heed that warning , I would’ve asked if he’d either let me tag along on the boat or take me back. Respect the water, respect the Croc
I love their verbiage. They take profanity to a whole new level. Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by one!!! Awesome!!
He heard from Liberals that crocodiles don't like blueberries.
"Where is the sign" Because Crocodiles can read, or listen to signs!
So this is what happened to the mysterious 5th Blue Teletubbie.
Box fish and saltwater crocodiles… oh yes and massive great whites… probably the safest place to be in Australia actually
He’s already procreated and voted, soo 🤷🏻‍♂️
Natural selection
A better question would be who do I need to call for you later mate?
Your in North Queensland... there are crocs.... everywhere.... always.
I get the heebie jeebies just thinking about it.
He wants to be a pretty snack 😅
The definition of natural selection, Dude was warned if he wants to gamble let him.
Normal Aussie conversation
The Crocs were like "Shut up Karen!" 😊
Idiot
I just don't think I would go near bodies of water in Australia.
I seen that same dude Dec 14 2024 busted up, he was missing a right leg and had one of his arms in a sling wearing a T shirt that says “Just doing my own thing!”
They’re just trying to stop him from winning the Darwin award come on now let him win it! 🏆
North QUEEEEEENSland
If anyone ever opened their mouth to offer advice, id adhere to. Not everyday someone shows such concern. This blue smurf has his head where his bottom should be
You heard what he said….”Let him do his thing”!!! The croc will do his thing also😐!!!
Senile....
Natural selection at it finest let him be enjoy the water npc don't know any different
What nationality is that bloke.
😂who care 😂let the man be the man😂😂
The fact the cameraman has on CROCS slipper 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol what an idiot 😂
Common sense isn't as common as you think it is anymore
Always listen to the locals.. put the pride and ego aside and listen because locals are there everyday !
He's put on his Darwin suit especially.
The first time he mentioned crocodile. Wait a minute, I wouldn't have been water at all. Not even with my legs dangling in water, especially in a strange place. That man doesn't have all his marvels in his jar.
I bet he's been doing that all his life, but I'm dying at the fact he looks like a topwater lure for a croc!😂 Like that's a kneeboard for a boat, and bro is just splashing in junebug😂😂😂
"iF I WANT TO BE DONE BY A CROC, THEN IT'S MY FREE RIGHT TO DO SO...!"
Stubborn Aussies
Croc snacks dumba$$ gummies priceless
He didn’t save my life he ruined my death 😂
really who do you think you are telling him what to do  Three signs  But  Every beach in Australia has shark or snake signs and we still swim  Its not your right to tell him when there are no actual crocodiles around in that spot  He is getting cooled off   Why are you there ? to make your video ?  Get a life
Paging Charles Darwin
🐊🐊🐊 a blue Smurf! He's speaking around and that's what attracts them~
Dude almost got a taste of that famous "natural selection"😂
And the Darwin award goes to....?
_You shouldn’t be in any waters over there in Australia_
Common scene doesn't exist anymore
Leave the guy alone apparently he's experimenting with Natural Selection 😂
If I was ever to go to Australia, the last thing I'd be doing is going in the f**king water!! Good on the bloke for warning the pillock on the ironing board.....
there is no reason why arrogant idiots should not get hit by nature.....
Please don't stop the coc from eating that's easy food.
Big food
Bye bye, my friend
Absolute idiocy !
WHY ARE YOU TRYNG TO SAVE ME
Croc food can talk..amazing.
If you go to Australia, listen to the locals. Australia can be a dangerous.
How about u warn him and help the guy ….? Maybe he’s just dumb enough not know… teach before u scold … just saying maybe I’m wrong
This dude is about to be human on the half shell.
I tried desperately to dissuade a visitor from taking a small boat out into the Gulf of Alaska. To no avail. His body was not recovered.
Dumb as a box of rocks😅😅😮😮😢😢😢 please make him go away
I wouldn't even stand near the edge of the ramp, nevermind paddle out.
I didn’t know there were Trump voters in Australia.
I would be so scared to get in any water in Australia lol. I would never want to be in a swimming pool. This guy Is out there Boogie boarding in crock  infested water. I hope He's not american 😅😅
Croc in the background shouting “shut up and stop interfering!”😂
Wt a d head get aut from There  Don't argue ideat!
Cleansing the gene pool...literally.
This is why we no longer see Smurfs on Television.
Thinning the herd...
Imagine being upset that people want you to live and not be eaten alive by crocs 😂😂
Am presently reading Death in Yellowstone.   The sheer idiocy of humans — in a terribly dangerous environment — is phenomenal.
Maybe the guy's from Florida? 😁
You can't help some people they will always blame you for good advice. I wouldn't want to fight a crocodile I would have been out of the water straight away.
Common sense is a fast track to a good old fight
Wasn't Australia originally populated with a bunch of people who lacked common sense?
Never interfere with natural selection. Lol
Karen behavior, let my man paddle he's one with the crocks.
Darwin was right.
i can understand the warning to help the guy, i cannot understand the pull out your phone and film it for some sort of kudos part.
Honestly, just leave him be. He's just proving Darwin's law. Let him do his scientific research.
Here’s your sign….
Sounds like ozzy sober. Rock on 🤘
Bro just leave him , he wants out of the gene pool
Some genes were just simply not meant to make it. It's not worth arguing with nature.
This is just natural selection😅
This legitimately sounds like a Monty Python skit.
If he gets turned into food it will obviously be a species upgrade😉
What a fud
Just let Darwinism do its job
The best is when he says "go ahead mate do what you want to do, go swim in the ocean but dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it."
I’m no where near alligators or crocodiles… but I still fear them every time I go near water 😂
Just set up a camera and wait lol
Looking forward to the follow up episode
This is called natural selection🤣
Sometimes you have to mind you own business 🤷🏻‍♂️ natural selection
The guy on the paddle board is like a democrat voter. The people on the dock are the Trump voters
Natural selection 😅
I see a Darwin’s award in his future
😅Some dumb idiots
We as humans need to STOP interfering with natural selection
The sign says...DO NOT FEED THE CROCODILES.
Hey, if I told you that you might crash your car, would you ever drive again? now, please stop preventing "when animals attack" content 😁
Man crocodiles have to eat too
“Go do what you want to do but don’t blame the crocodile if you get done by it” a philosophy every society needs. Maybe this would take away the guard rail in the Grand Canyon that people still go over. No pity for the weak minded.
Idiot
Darwinism is hard at work...😆
The crocs are, "shhh, he's fine. No worries..."
Winner of the annual Darwin awards
Crocodile: "look mate! It's lunch!"
At least he won't get sunburned while being eaten and drowned....
Idiot
My daughter visited Queensland and was told in no one certain terms that there were crocs in the ocean.
They're hungry. This mans volunteering to be food. No blame.
Please leave these people alone… the human world has no use for them
Just mind your own business
Fun fact: Australia doesn't actually have crocodiles, just aligators and caymans.
Bro doesn't want to look dumb while looking like a surfing Teletubby.
If you have an accent like that bro I'm listening to any and all advice you're giving me
Natural selection 😊
FAFO.  He's about to find out.
In reality they don't want to fish out buddies leftover carcass.
Human evolution 2024,sheeeeezzz
Ever heard of Darwinism? Let people do their thing bro. We don’t all need to hear your whiney voice
Natural selection
“Where are the signs…” *”There, there and one over there”* 😂🤣
Is that a sky diving suit?!
I would warn him once...then, its nature's way
He follows the diego advice: i am nice to the crocs they will be nice to me.
Sounds like another case of Suicide by Crocodile
For my fellow Americans, you can understand that as the British equivalent of “you’re on a Florida lake” or “a Louisiana swamp”. This redcoat really started to paddle like a turtle in Gater infested waters
Let the croc take em out of the gene pool.
Natural Selection 😜
What the heck 🤔
Let nature sort it out.
Did you get bit?  Did anyone throw in a chicken?
Um….hard to blame the crocodile when you are been digested.
Let him go. He's probably a liberal. No love lost there.
I wouldn't waste my breath on ignorant airheads!
Only one race brave enough
Just film the Darwinism when it happens for us to see!😂
A BIG THANK YOU TO JAWS MOVIE THAT ALWAYS PREVENT ME FROM GETTING INTO UNCHARTED, UNKNOWN AND MURKY OPEN WATER.  YOU WONT KNOW WHAT LURKS BENEATH WHEN YOU CANT EVEN SEE YOUR FEET.  WHEN FELLOW AUSSIE ADVISE YOU, LISTEN TO HIM OR HER. SAME GOES TO FLORIDA OR LOUISIANA LOCALS WHO WILL ADVISE YOU THE SAME THING...............👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻.
The funniest thing is of course, that man had so much attitude for someone wearing a bright blue full body swimsuit like Papa Smurf
My guy is literally Uber eats!😂😂😂😂😂
New challenge unlocked: go yell at Floridians swimming in the alligator infested waters
do t bite the hand that helps you
Darwin...it's called natural selection. Let nature run its course.
Darwin theory in Cairns….
If someone’s telling you to get out and they’re serious you should prolly listen, my personally I’d start imagining they’re suddenly under me and that would be enough but some peoples RWR is off I guess🤣
Natural selection
But did he die?😎
That guy is from Melb , they only see tall buildings over there.
What is the guy even trying to do?!?
Wonder what happened afterward
DA
What an idiot!!
If you want to argue about it fine bro go find out yourself 😂
Some people are so poor in intrinsic value that the only thing they own is a right to choose. Choosing other than someone recommends is about the only control, strength, or wealth that they’ll ever have. So they oppose at any cost. Super sad actually
Our egos will not let us listen when someone is belittling us. It's a defense mechanism.  Instead of belittling the guy by inferring that he doesn't have any common sense, maybe just a polite reminder in case he didn't see the signs would have gotten him out of there faster and safer.
Bro did not want to see a man get eaten by a crocodile, probably seen it before being Australian and all.
"Don't blame the crocodile" somehow, I'm going to incorporate that into a conversation, or a work email.
The most Australian thing ever is being offended and angry that someone is trying to tell you what to do, no matter the circumstances.
I wouldn't get in a swimming pool in Australia
He's lucky crocs don't like the taste of blue.
And people wonder why it’s the tourists that get eaten
Dude has the survival instinct of a baby
I'm so glad I can swim in lakes here in Germany and don't have to worry about crocs
I had a woman try to sue me for medical expenses after pulling her from her burning car because she was cut by something on the way out the window.
Natural selection... Bet those are Muricans... No loss, there.
The reason for the rise in idiots is because of warning signs.
Florida man goes in water everyday with them why yall so scared
Darwins law at work. R.I.P.
Maybe he wanted to die.  Leave people alone.
It's called natural selection. We should stop warning these kind of people.
Crocs won’t eat him he’s so brave he doesn’t show any fear I think he’s American
Believe the man on Crocs, he knows.. 😁
He’s doing his best impression of a penguin paddling in for dinner…
Don’t forget people. This is a man from a country where they have just voted in Donald Trump as their next president! Not the smartest nation in the world!
Why couldn’t a croc breach the water the moment dude said where, i keep watching this video like his date is gonna change😂
Yep, could’ve been another temporary Australian citizen. 😻
Natural selection...this guy is a big chance to be nominated for a Darwin award.
People get smarter from Generation to Generation 😅
I'd just be like, mate, you're gonna die if you stay out there. People don't swim around here for good reason
At this point i call it natural selection
The definition of natural selection stopped by a higher intelligence.
How rude of you to interrupt his paddling activities in water where crocs frequent. -Grim reaper
Shouldn't interfere with next year's Darwin's Award winner
white people love to do this foolishness lol
dont insult him , have some common sense.
Those that are entitled, will be weeded out in the end. “Where’s the sign” pfft as if a croc cares about a sign. I would have told the smurf I don’t want the image of you being torn apart in my head for the rest of my life. However, it would make for a good bar room story.
I want to see the sign
Is this the wokeness?
Ironically both men were killed by spiders
You can't tell a liberal anything.
Mind ya business mate
Leave him alone and let's test the Darwin theory.
Dude also had a British accent sooooo
Contestant for the Darwin awards....
When Florida Man visits Australia...
“You’re in North Queensland” homie shouldn’t be walking near a puddle without checking it first. Crocs are no joke in that part of the country
The camera guy is wearing Crocs
It is so difficult to  understand how an adult can react to common sense advice. Im amazed at the angry reaction to having someone pount out crocs waiting in the  sand to attact this man but he just  reacts with total anger. Hope he lived thru his day in Queensland .
Always Americans comparing Florida to Australia. They should try taking a swim with the saltys before speaking.
I was out at “you’re in..” 😂
As a nurse I can tell something is 'not right' with his behaviour. Dementia or personality disorder perhaps?
Guys this was his suicide attempt please be kind ppl fighting battle u have no idea about rip martin
Never intervene!  Let darwin work his magic 🏆
Looks like someone else will have to accept his Darwin Award 🥈 on his behalf 😂
There is just no helping some people! Oh, common sense just ain't that commonly found
Where’s the rest of his band mates!😂😂😂
Natural selection..
Natural selection at this point. Don’t worry about him.
And todays Darwin award goes to!!! 😂
the stupidity of this dude is off the charts..
But his wife told him that it would be alright  She told him already about those crazy protect the nature guy's Whom don't want anybody around
thought the blue ranger was smarter than that
Don’t blame the crocodile great…( common sense)??? Lololol
Is he from Melbourne or Sydney?
Natural selection: 2024 edition.
We have similar idiots here in Florida. In my town, we have a small lake with many gators that can be seen sunbathing and yet visitors walk close to edge, walk yappy little dogs, and let little kids wander. So regularly gators are blamed for bites & dead pets. Read the d@mn signs.
Search  "Darwin working in real time"
What an idiot. You’d think he’d be eternally grateful for time sensitive potentially life saving advice.
A Blue onesie is croc proof
This is a great example of how society has gone. Just take all the WARNING signs off everything and let nature take its course..🙄
People like him are only serving to dilute the gene pool with stupidity, let nature take its course
Did he get attacked?  There’s an arrogant person born every second.  Warn him once then walk away.
He's afraid to go back on shore cause the dingos might eat him!😅
Silly little rubber man
We have two Key words here....  👉🏼Common Sense👈🏼Why bother mate, these days unfortunately many wouldn't know what Common Sense means lol,,,,,Some people just can't be told lol🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊Then again he might be ok, dressed up like that lol....
That's an odd way to dress for dinner
Natural selection...let it be...
Where's the sign, you fkwit.
He literally saved his life because it sounds like towards the end. The guy was realizing he was an idiot, and if the guy didn’t say anything to him, he probably would have got eaten by a crocodile.
You can lead a horse to water... There's definitely better ways to leave this world...
my god if someone tells you that you are in danger fricking listen to them 🤦
He probably got some good healthcare… 🛟
😂😊😂😮😂 common sense its not that common 😊
Just let natural selection do it's thing
Don't waste your breath! Natural selection will take care of them!!
Why you worried about him. If he is dumb let him be.
I bet the dude took to Tik Tok to cry & complain that he was 'attacked' by people spoiling his fun!
"I'm fully aware of it" While he does the EXACT kind of little splashes with his hands that attract crocs
I wonder if the suit would make him taste like blueberries to the crocodiles.
I really think all safety signs and warnings need to be removed. Let nature take it's course.
This IDIOCY has to STOP!!! please  leave  the  crocodiles alone. Let them eat their snacks!
How about mind your own business. Why are you recording anyways.
Darwin effect.
Nurture vs nature... Or maybe it is just nature. 😂😂😂
Democrats 😂😂😂
It's fine, Cross hate blueberries! 😂
"Where's the sign?"  "One there, one there, the croc behind you is holding one, that family of crocs are taking a picture with one, there's a shredded one covered in blood floating beside you....
Thinning the herd
@Petet Hy
I would take his word for it and heed  the warning
I want to see the rest of the vudeo
Why can't we just go back to natural selection? Seriously, the problem could literally solve itself...
Are you sure this isnt Darwin.... 😂 I think hes looking for an award 😆🤦🏻🤦🏻😂
If I ever make it to Australia, I am never going near the water😅
"Where's the sign?" like nature signposts all it's dangers, what an utter tool 😂😂😂
Never saw someone so determined to become a snack
I guess we know how this ended…
Est-ce que les crocodiles mangent les Shtroumfs?🤔🤣
Consolation trophy on Darwin Awards.
Wow
Darwin award nominee
My friend lives in Cairns and she said the exact thing when i asked how the water was. She said no swimming in these waters.   She also has a kangaroo who hops down her street every night. The sounds of Australia are wild as well with all the incects.
Don't worry its nature weeding out the species
We have to STOP warning and protecting idiots..let NATURE run its course and soon our society will be a lot friendlier and efficient, as people are NATURALLY removed from it
Crocs are his mates😂😂
🤨You can't fix stupidity!! They will become  food.! 🤔
Full of crocs he is nuts or will lose some
Why not just wait and see what happens? 😂
This is why we should remove all the warning labels from everything and let it all set itself right!
On an unrelated note, why tf was that dude in a blue morph suit? Is that usual paddle board attire?
Natural selection
Im just assuming that the squawker holding the camera, has never swam ever, because crocs could be somewhere at any given time. Normally, Id highly doubt that this was old dudes first merry go round, but this whole thing is just so bizarre. My judgment, is that this is scripted.
Two words not normally used together Australian and common sense
Another one for the ego🤦‍♂️ people always have to be right even when they're wrong
Then when hes attacked he blames the signs for not showimg him 😂😂😂😂
Wow!
Sorry mate... 13 14ft maybe...  maybe you need a iq of 70 before a crock will take you down under,  tender rise you a bit, emm good eatin..
AMAZING.. BOARD GUY IS UPSET that hes being warned he could sonday be a meal for a CROC...
Your in North Queensland, like you know this guy's a tourist that thinks he knows best.
Thinning the herd
What's the guy recording on? A paddle board?
The good guy is wearing crocs
Leave the dude alone.He just wants to swim on a boogie board with crocs bro
I would’ve grab me a box and watch the show
Natural Selection LIVE
Yo why tf did i think this was canada? Im buggin
There's always one.
He is literally arguing that he should be allowed to be eaten if he so desires
What a fool!
ego has been the death of many men 😂
Darwinism has its place. If you know something is dangerous and do it anyway you either better be getting paid really well or willing to have today be your last. Good luck either way cos your likely to need it sooner or later.
There are dumb people
Stupidity at its best
Don't help that Darwin at work😅
Why is he paddling on a tow knee board.  He’s got dementia.  That’s Joe Biden out there.
It's like touching a wet paint sign. Oh it's wet.
This knobs gotta be a tourist, SMH
Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done byit!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Temporary Australian
I think the crocodiles are the ones in danger, they'd die laughing at his outfit.
man those crocs are nasty big there and evil
Did he get out of the water?
That guys last name is either the victim or pray
Darwin Awards in play.
Natural selection...
Natural selection..
Let him be.  Not your circus, not your problem.
Wearing crocs giving a warning about crocs. God bless you.
Same problem in the Florida Keys...
Nothing ‘adventurous’ or brave about that … but that will be the eulogy. In Australia we call it being a ‘f-wit’! 🫶🏽🇦🇺❤️
Wow that s very scary. Never take risks it very dangerous.
Just because youre all soft doesnt mean everyone has to be🤷‍♂️
Common sense is kinda different in Queensland.🐊 😂
Thin the herd
Was he ever seen again?..idiot..🤐
In Florida, if the water is wet there is probably an alligator in it…🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
The man paddling went on to become a prime minister
Just let the natural selection of things take course mate.  It’s called thinning the gene pool.
His obviously upset because his core temp is 100° westing that in dirent sunlight
I’ve seen Swedish tourists ignore ‘CROCODILE & SHARK INVESTED WATERS - DO NOT SWIM’ signs 🪧 just to cool off in the Northern Territories. People’s stupidity never ceases to surprise me! 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
It’s 2024 and people still haven’t figured out Australia is dangerous??? 😂
Darwin vacationing down under!
Who cares
They're trying to save him & he's arguing with them 🤦‍♂️
He’ll be shocked and upset when he loses the battle with the crocs
Leave him alone ..  let the Ctoc's strengthen the gene pool
Wearing the bright blue jump suit so the croc won't miss him 😂
I hope he survived long enough to learn how dumb he was being. He didn't even have a paddle. He was stirring the water like a fish in distress almost calling the crocodile 🐊🐊🐊 to come and eat him. He reminds me of the Monty Python sketch where people even put special sauces on themselves to get eaten faster. That is the only thing missing with this guy on his flimsy board. 🐊 🐊 🏄‍♂️🐊🐊🐊🐊😮
To be fair he wouldn't blame the crocodile when he's done by it😂
That’s life
Should’ve just let him go and watch it
Paddling his way to his next Palestinian protest or transgender rights movement
Meanwhile in Florida, we’re training ours for house pet roles
Failed member of the Blue Man Group thought it was a green screen for hungry crocodiles.
Shush up and just film it bro. Tourists lol
Idiot!
"Dumberer and dummerer', said Alice.
All he had to say was “thank you but I’m ok with swimming with crocodiles in here” lol
Natural selection at work
I'd pay attention to the signs but if I didn't see them and a local was showing a care about my well being I should take that very seriously
I really want us to get rid of all warning signs for like 3 years and let's just see who makes it.
Dude ,Let Mother Nature work ...Its Natural Selection 😂😂
Idiots can't Hear they are Deffo❤😅
let natural selection take its course 💀😳😂
Waiting for the follow-up 'after snack' report...
See this is arrogance again. Instead of listening, they still want to argue, leave me to do my thing.....  Yeah alright.....   That's arrogance.  Like drivers on the roads, just pull out in front of moving vehicles hoping they're give way.  Arrogance will cut your life shorter then you think.
This is why innocent animals get killed because they attack the ignorant human who jumped into their home against posted advice
The camera man is wearing crocs.
Darwin award about to be given out.
Just let him be
After you warn them twice it's darwin time.
Crocs have more self respect than to eat a Smurf.
Australia the land of common sense 😂😂no common sense no worries we won't be seeing you for long
Natural selection
A definite Darwin Award nomination, Wears a stinger suit but ignores the salty's!!!
That guy is total IDIOT he must be part of the “WOKE” morons who believe crocodiles just need a hug
Unless it’s directly affects me I stop thinking for fools
"I don't think much of these new, blue flavoured humans. They taste really sour & bitter"  - Mr. S. Water-Crocodile
Gotta love an Aussie 😂😂😂😂
If your in the tropics and the loose as faark locals arent in the water, dont go in the farking water😂😂😂
Went swimming once in Australia. Locals asked us if we knew what the bubbles in the water meant, we said no. He let us know that they were all Crocs on the bottom.  We ended up leaving soon after.
I wish David Attenborough would narrate this clip 😂
Honestly as an Australian, youd be surprised how often this happens. Ive gone to beaches where theres signs with pictures of crocs and deadly jellyfish with transalations in every language you can think of. Theyre all over the place. Yet still you see people get into the water sometimes bringing their kids too. Heres a simple clue. If its a beautiful sunny day and theres plenty of people around and yet stragely no ones going near the water, maybe thats coz theres a good reason for it. Always watch the locals and listen to them.
Let the gene pool clean itself.
But did he die tho?
Darwin award application accepted
And if dude gets eaten YouTube takes the video down for "community guidelines"
You can tell he’s an older man they all turn into Karen and Ken’s at a certain age fancy arguing with someone who is trying to save you just so you can be right 🤷‍♀️
It's called natural selection!😂😂😂😂
The Croc will make sure there won’t be any complaints.
On a tiny floater, splashing around, poor balance, high vis color....it's like he's begging to be eaten.
QUEEEEENSLANDEEER
This’s how natural selection works 😂
He's clearly scubacidal lol
People are crazy
Plot twist the man is the croc that’s waiting around the boat ramp for fish 😂
Really says something about the times we’re in when you have a man in crocs giving proper warning to another man about the croc infested water he’s in….. magnificent display of irony
Some people are beyond help
Darwinism lives.
Just let him swim with the crocs you Karen
When’s man wearing crocs tells you a crocodile will eat you, you listen.
Dude must not realize they're not talking about a lil 3 ft croc.....theyre talking about 12-15 footers 😂😂😂😂
mind your own business the guy is in very little danger...idiots it's more dangerous dealing with people driving on the road up there.
Crocs says hey mate stop telling him 😂😂😂😂that's a easy Doordash order
2M views. 1 crazy person.
Bro common sense is a superpower in today's world
Pretty sure you can guess what orange idiot they voted for this election :P
Protects himself from sunshine, but not got the common sense to stay safe from crocodiles 🐊🐊🐊
As a German who lived in Australia for a while I can promise: if there’s a „aware croc sign“ , it doesn’t lie 😂 - people from Europe will understand
Will be a great content, just keep filming
I live in Canada and I would not need a sign before visiting there. I say remove all the safety warnings and let darwinism win.
Im never getting near water in places where the people have this accent
Time to set out the lawn chair i guess
Those are saltwater crocs, they are the biggest and most ferocious
Ok but why in the f is he dressed like that?!
Anyone mention the bull sharks? 🤔
Team blue.
Idiot
You did your part you warned him. Now let him prove you right. 😂😂😂
MENTAL GIANT
Lol when they find bits and pieces of him later on in the week Can't say he wasn't  warned
They should be telling him to keep paddling
Pride comes befor a fall
Sun protection is very important in these situations.
What a flog he woke up and chose stupidity this morning 😂
Wearing crocs while warning people about crocs
Famous last words, “Yeah righto”
Californian liberals 😂
Oh my gosh, how ignorant can you be. I believe Any man or woman hears the word you’re swimming, with crocodiles will be added at water quicker than speedy Gonzalez.
Don’t say anything people!!! In this modern age this is our “predator” -  stupidity- and by warning him - he continues living and possibly having more dangerously dumb kids
Crazy how stubborn people are willing to be…. Bro probably just spent a fortune on the clown outfit and board
If an Aussie is telling you to get out of the water. You know it’s dangerous lol.
This guy is the reason my laundry detergent says "DO NOT EAT" 😢😢😢
Social Darwin-ism
When i was travelling, i used to go for an early morning walk on Four Mile Beach. I used to wonder why it was so deserted, until one morning i was sitting with my back to the jungle shrub and heard rustling. I ran so fast. A local later  told me that wasn't a safe thing to do at all.
And the Darwin Award goes to….
"Wheres the SIGNS...?  "Well mate you see, the problem there is CROCS CANT FKING READ can they ya drongo....??"
Dude looks like a telitubbi 😂
the only virtue the western crazies should be pushing is common sense (at this point it should have been a virtue) not their self righteous hypocracies.
You got gators there I did'nt know that. I live in Florida I don't swim in the ponds here or around fish docks as well.
What is he doing in the water to
The audacity of these idiots!  Let him get eaten!!!
I hope that man wasn't British for goodness sakes! 😭 I'm telling you now most of us Brits definitely would NEVER paddleboard in their waters! 🙌
Natural selection let it happen 😅
What a absolute tool.
Must be a foreigner.
Where's the sign ? One there , one there and one there.😅😂
There wasn't a sign!! I didn't see the sign! The sign isn't big enough!  Doesn't matter. Are you going to go play sports on the highway? There's no sign there.
He should have went to Darwin to collect his award.
They don’t understand, him wearing blue was his way to camouflage if he’s in danger. The croc would think he’s the sky, and focus on chomping his board, of which then he will become one with the water. 😂
I've never seen the kind of crazy that we're seeing today. Absolutely ridiculous! "No! Let me be to go get eaten by Crocs! It's my business! Stay out of it!" 😂 Unbelievable! These people are crazy! And they've lived long enough to know better. 😂
Guys, let nature sort itself out. This is one of the warning labels that if people choose to ignore it, they have no one to blame but themselves for their misfortune.
And the liberals say the conservatives only care about themselves
Old mate is protecting himself from jellyfish but not against crocs,sharks and snakes 🤣
"You get what you FK'n deserve."
Let natural selection take its place 🙏🤣
Darwin spoke of this...
"Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it". That's such sound Australian advice.
How to tell if there are crocs. Just walk up to the water and touch it. If it's wet, there are crocs.
Funny, because no queeeeeenslander has ANY sense at all - let alone common sense!
Darwin Award leader!
Everyone needs to eat, just do what your mother told you and don't play with the food.
In most parts of australia, you see water you assume theirs a croc in it.
Missing: The Village Idiot,  last seen on a body board. Very snippy attitude
The crocodiles lucky day
Shouldn't of said anything 😂😂😂
Yep, a red hot Darwin Award nominee...unbackable odds I'd say.
Just let nature do its thing
Be interested to know if he made it back to shore without getting eaten
Beggars belief!!!
People are so dumb... it's obviously one of those not to do things in northern Australia
Oh my God, even as Kiwi, who's never been to Northen Australia, I know this...
Arrogance at its worse..
Don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it😂😂, I think he should listen..
He's a candidate for a Darwin award
This man needs to get out of that water and rent a boat. Crocodiles don't just eat you like a shark does you're dead fairly quickly after a big shark gets ahold of you but a crocodile rips you to pieces and drowns you
Paddling round on that tray like a TV dinner 🤣
"But im a tourist, im allowed to do what i want!"
Natural selection, do not interfere with nature
It's nice of you to try and help him, but he's proven.He has no common sense and he's not gonna last long down under
😭😳 Dang those signs and camera dude, they just blew Tellytubbies life insurance scam right out of the water! 😆
Just let him learn that life lessons on his own😂 At least something is going to have a full belly.
Let it go mate, kids now days think they can respawn when bad thing happens, he said let him do his thing proudly so let nature do it’s things.
That's how nature thins the dummies out of the herd.
Just listen to the locals
What language is that? Is that English???
Interesting. For just that one day, Darwin moved from NT and moved next door to Cairns just for our boy here.
"Wheres the sign"... Lets just remove all the signs
Says the man on a paddle board. Both tools
Pride is a mortal sin; in this case, literally.
None of you are fish.  Get out of the water and grow up
Dear god man, the spiders are the size of chihuahuas there and the locals don’t bat an eye. The fact They are scared for him tells me this MF paddled into LAKE PLACID
This is an example when you raise safety issues at work, but the a few of the workers and or managers quickly respond back by saying where are the signs?  And when you ask for their safety related input they suggest to have more signs.
The American white man swim in more dangerous waters than that. They don't care😂
My god we found another person that made us put warning labels on everything
For God's sake give the man a break, mankaren. He has just been divorced by his wife, lost his house and all his future incomes. You will do the same.
You can't train f#@*wits 🫡.
Croc wont leave him to do his own thing.  News at 6 victim.
Surley s Greenvoter
“Where’s the sign?” “THERES THREE OF EM”
Let the ignorant fade themselves out!! You can’t help people, they can’t see past their nose.
I thought at first he was point out crock s
Crocs will thin herd natural selection
Nah let nature takes its course, need less unintelligable people for the future 😂
We really need to stop coddling idiots. That’s the reason humanity has devolved since the invention of civilization. Darwin needs to do his work
Got the stinger suit in so he’ll be safe 👍🏼
Just let the Smurf be... it's called "natural selection."
He's a fresh Blueberry man-snack! Served on a nice little platter too!
That goober identifies as a croc hors d'oeuvre!! 🍡🦎
U think  crocs are just waiting on fish at the BOAT RAMP?  There waiting on someone like this guy.
Steve irwin clearly had an affair...
Karens always never minding their business.
Natural selection at its finest
No need to swear. You sound like an idiot.
This kind of stupidity is surprisingly on the rise  and its getting out of hand.
Stop annoying the poor bloke. Jesus. Let him be.
Don't try that in South Australia either mate! Theres no Croc's here because the sharks ate them all! 😉
This guy has the F@cking nerve to ask where the signs are when someone warns him that it might not be smart to paddle board in the Croc water 😂🤣 I love the camera guy’s reaction when he realized the paddle boarder was an idiot and had no common sense. Ok you want to go in Perfect don’t blame the Crocodile when your under the water being thrashed not able to breathe 😂🤣🤦‍♂️
let the croc have him :).
Famous last words: “I’m fully aware of it” “Just leave me to do my thing and you do yours” “Where’s the sign?”
Typical woke reasoning , leave him be natural selection in my book .
When a local is shouting at you about crocodiles, you listen for crying out loud!
Isnt that Joe Biden ?
Is it illegal to throw up package of hot dogs in the water in Queensland? 😅
Some people don't deserve a warning 😮
Where the sign?.!  Where you from Sydney duck head!  Don't need a sign clown,  use you're head idiot
The signs don’t specify that the crocks leave the blue man group alone!!!!
Poor crock will probably be throwing up rubber for a week
Imagine being in North Queensland and needing a sign to tell you to not get in the water 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
Need to trust the locals!
Just cleaning the gene pool 😂
What's he wearing
Listen to the locals bro I think they know better and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to not paddle off shark and alligator infested  waters
If the aussie tells you to have common sense then you know its serious 😂
Uhuh uhu uhuh!  Adah dah   Dahhhhhhhhh!
How arrogant to think he is above the laws of nature, in his blue rubber johny suit 😮
The Darwin Award goes to….
You can't teach the dumb mate.
What a dope
One of those that done their own research 😅
Famous last words, „Yeah righto“
He didn't sound very grateful. Good on them for caring even though this guy had an attitude.
Listen now or we will all be hearing about another croc 🐊 attack on the late night news.
Never admit a mistake, very important!
Welcome to Cairns, where dumb people gets eaten by Crocs. 🐊
Go ahead croc bait...
I just would've kicked back and watched the show instead of saying anything 😅
"Just leave me to do my thing" Famous last words
Nature has its way of weeding out the weak😂😂😊
Natural selection at its finest 😳 And the Darwin award goes to!!!!!!!!!
maybe he is a croc hunter
Local knowledge should never be ignored...
There's always got to be one, doesn't there. Deaf, dumb and blind.
Natural selection example coming up..... 🦎
He just wants to save the crocodiles from a toxic piece of meat wrapped up in plastic foil.
Isn’t Darwin in Queensland? That tiny board and him paddling into croc infested waters is killing me over here! 😂 What a marroon!
That poor filthy frank character.
If there was a croc near by it probably woulda got him by now with all the splashing he’s doing
🤦🏻‍♂️
Must be from Commiefornia.
Yes Australians can and often are passive aggressive, but we mean well. So stay out of the fucken water, ar yer have a bonzer day.
Natural selection ......
What a fool.
Must be a woke American
U can’t educate pork u can only tenderise it😂
Why bother wasting time and energy. Mind your business and let the homeboys find out. DARWIN AWARD!!
I don't know why you are blurring his face ? This is "expert level" double down, dumb a##, and as such deserves to stay up for all perpetuity 😂
You know he’s Aussie too coz he says ‘righto!’ Mateeeeeee?
Phawking knee board what thrift store did he find that aren't you supposed to be pulled by a boat with that thing
Just to be the 4000th comment
Bro thinks crocs wont eat him cos he's blue right? 🤣
Survival of the smartest I think in this case lol 😂
F that
Darwinism.....
Crocs food dinner time
Legend has it...hes still paddling by the boat ramp looking at signs 🛑
Darwin is calling! 😂
Idiots like that gets a croc shot for no reason, what an tool!
Survive of the fittest
😂😂😂😂
Just let him argue with the crocodile about why it shouldn't be there..... What a pl0nker!
I hate that he sounds american 😒 asking where the freaken signs are..not like he is going to be able to sue the crocs
Idiot....
Someone should just put a collection of these Aussie vids together I'd watch them everytime it's that time of the month 👌🏼😂😂
He's sounded like Steve when he said don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it 👌🏼🤠 legend! Gotta teach the wankas
No pay out for medical after his attack snd no pension etc from Disability in the future from loss of limbs. No payouts to wife or family either after he's attacked and maimed or killed. Zero financial assistance to someone CHOOSING to be attacked and possibly killed by a croc !!!!  The blatant ignorance of this bloke is breathtaking !!!
The dude is NUTS and suicidal
Worry about your own common sense, and watch your tone it's attracting Crocs
This is natural selection culling the herd.
Gen Z ... no common sence at all. They know best. Meow... 😂
Haha "where's the sign" why do these people need baby sitting through every aspect of life.
Just let nature take its course
🥴
Boomer
Three meal course right there.
Some mothers do have'em
Wasted time... He doesn't want your advice!  There is no cure for stupidity!!
I've been around small salt water Crocs ..... Dude, get out of the water!  They're scary at any size
Darwin awards candidate
Natural Selection. 🤷🏻‍♂️
There's always one isn't there 😂
Man has taken out huge life insurance for his wife to cash out soon after a delicious meal for the hungry Crocs. He's tired of living.
Not him asking where the signs are as if the guy would lie about something like that😂
In the end he got paranoid
Just let him be. The crocs are hungry. 😂
Live footage of Darwins theory of evolution  in action. What an absolute Wagyu 100% grain fed tool !
Must be nice being dumb 😊😊😊
Listen to the man in crocs 😅
God please take this bloke and Give us Steve Irwin back...
This man has been protected for way too long lol
It's just natural selection
Doesn't he have a Oar?..... His  spashing  with his Hands is probably attracting Great Whites too. His movements are.... "a Fish in distress" to Predators in the Water.....Sharks and Crocs.
Croc probably dont like old man meat. Taste like dirt
“And children, today in biology class we are looking at a case of evolution by natural selection.”
Darwin was right it’s called natural selection
I choose to believe that was oobah butler
I had a little discussion with a co worker about whether i'd rather be attacked by a Croc or a shark, and i'd take the shark all day long, at least with a shark you have a chance, they will bite because they're curious but we're not usually on the menu for them. a croc on the other hand, if you are in or near the water, you have a less than 0% chance if they grab you. DO NOT GO SWIMMING IN CAIRNS!!!!
If an Ozzie is telling you it’s in your best interest to listen to them, it’s their backyard and they know what’s in it
Reminds me of the ole man in the boat from Jaws. Get a clue dude
Come to New Zealand lol
Shhh... don't say anything and let natural selection play out. We dont want his DNA in the gene pool anyways ❤
😂
He was later bitten by a crocodile.
Dumb  c
What a brain dead idiot, just can’t help some people
hesan idjit
Same entitled generation, no idea. Can tell them until your blue in the face.
I was 10 and was swimming up the north end of Western Australia in a Salt and Fresh water croc infested Estuary. A crocodile sightseeing tourist boat went past and judged my parents.
Let darwinism play out, he's the expert in his safe space blue onesy
This guy is crazy. How are you gonna doubt these people?
Darwin at work.
Definitely one of those "I've lived here all my life" type dudes.
Let him be he wants to be a snack
Common sense is not that common 😢
This is why we should just take down warning signs and warning labels and just let whatever happens happen. Nature will sort it all out. Then dumb people wont breed anymore.
Walking away after he sayd you do you and I'll do me would have had the potential for a way better video, mate.
Upcoming Darwin winner....
I would have asked him if he can read English and he said yes then I walk away and if he said no then try my best to warn him.
Lets natural selection kick in , the dude looks old ,so probably reproduced, but anyway that much Lesser carbon footprint aint bad. Go crocki
Don't try to prevent evolution do its work.
Darwin award?
Natural selection at its best 😂
Is he by chance American? Because we hate being told NO 😅 "Don't Tread On Me"  or "Im American I know everything"  der duh bing bing bing 😂😂😂😂
When I was in Timor we had a rule - if the locals aren't in the water don't go in.
Ocean has sharks. Those people need to shut up and mind their own business!
Uber Eats, for crocs.
Oh my god! Listen to the locals!! 🤯🙈 Just dont get washed up on the beach half eaten. Our kids dont need to see that! 🤡
I think people really forget Australia has things like crocodiles, venemous reptiles and insects, rabid dingos, and various marsupials and other things that will hurt you or get you arrested for touching them.
I never understand it when people get angry because other people don't want them to die.
Wow
These idiots put Crocs lives at risk when the drongo gets takin by one.
Clearly doesn't like to be saved from being a human nugget .
"Where ist the sign?" Did he actually say that? 😂😂😂
“Crocs love boat ramps, they hang around waiting for fish” croc- heads up boys we got a big fish.
I like how Aussies say “Croc” - sounds good
We gotta stop interfering with Natural Selection. 😅
It would be a foreigner !
Once upon a time the idiots died off quickly
Please show us your video of the croc having a Smurf snack.
Insane. People like that are why there's labels to not drink petrol.
In Australia we call this natural selection. FAFO!
When you have to tell someone to have Common Sense
Maybe he thought it was the proper name for the shoes
You're in North Queens' land. Have some respect... By the way, who is your president ?  Man on bored: Biden  Carry on.
Nutural selection😅
She's right mate. I'm all good. It only happens to other people. It won't happen to me.
"Where's the sign?"   Man immediately points out multiple within eyesight 😂
There's the hint: from "I'm fully aware" to " where's the sign?". Famous last words before you get to be in the local news.
Is that in cairns
Darwinism
Stop it, he’s been on Google. He’s done his research. Let natural selection do its thing.
A Trump voter
Is this a joke or skit or something 😂
He’s filming Forrest Gump 2.
This is why I don't fk with people anymore.  You can't even save their life without being crucified for it.
Darwin award winner right there
Australia is Jumanji
You tried your best now let Darwin's law run it's course!
In his defence the water looks really nice 😅
Im a big "don't  tell me what to do" kind of guy, but crocks can learn to view humans as food so it really shouldnt be allowed for ppl to put yourself in scenarios like that. You could be training a crock to actively seek out humans.
Darwin award candidate right there.
Stay in the water till the crock gives u some love u can do it i believe in u do it
Leave him. It's called natural selection. Health and safety is watering down the gene pool.  Surely you have noticed with your own eyes that we are becoming populated by gibbering idiots (a LOT of whom are in political power)
🤣😆👌
Average Aussie leftist.
Idiot....no cure for him!......so cool that people tried to help. The problem  is, the  crocs  see him, and people like him, and so   they hang around the ramps more often.
Could say it nicely, you don’t go helping people and act mean to them at the same time
What a dumba55
Don’t even bother just let nature take its course, there’s no point with arguing with smurfs
at this point let natural selection do its thing 💀😭
I’ll take bad ideas for 500 Alex!
Typical Australian day I’d imagine
What a idiot
Typical suspect smh.
Australia is the PvP server of the world.
Tourists man so dumb
Don't understand why camera man is so upset. You've given the man a warning, now let him learn the hard way 😂
Smart Tourist 😂
Let natural selection be...Muppet
Well said mate, croughy
The blue man just desperately wants to be right.
Leave him to it. He's obviously been bred for Croc dinner so let nature take it's course. He's wrapped in clingfilm so the crocs can keep him fresh in their meat lockers anyway
What a complete ignorant idiot...big praise for the local guy trying to warn him 😊👏🏽👍🏾
Perfect example of the 2024 entitled Aussie..... city folks
He was eaten 3 minutes later
Looks like the yearly common "Swimwithcroccos'about"
I don’t go in the water until I get to Melbourne
Where's the sign?   Bruh in from Texas, never seen a crocodile in real life outside the zoo but I know one thing, if you are in any part of Australia there is Crocs in the water. You don't even question it
Can’t help stupidity
Candidate for Darwin Award.
I want to quote something about natural selection, but I’m not that sharp.
Bugging typical idiot mates 😂😂
Ae ae ae ae
He would rather argue than save his life. That's a man with more estrogen than testosterone. Plastic anyone?
He sounds like he knows what he is doing. Leave him alone. He will either survive or die. Just keep your video going and you might get some great footage for the evening news.
"Yeah righto" idk why but his reaction is hilarious
If the native towards me about crocodiles I'm listening
Wow, Australian locals are telling you don’t go onto the water listen, because that blue outfit he has on, or turn red as soon as the crocodile 🐊 bites him with his jaw
And we always blame the croc
He's a right duck head
This was the last footage of the man ever seen.
Brain cell ... Less than half 😮
Idiots
Tick tock told me it's fine 😂
Darwin take the wheel
The crocodile is like oh you've wrapped my present in blue for me.
Why don’t you just mind your own business and enjoy the entertainment. Why do you feel you need to say something
What an idiot ...
Stupidity: Natures way of thinning the herd of the unfit.
Here comes the annoying woman
Stupidity knows no bounds no bounds.  Leave him to learn the hard way.
It’s wearing a blue dress, it’s crearle a fake human!😂🐊🐊🐊
He’s one of the guys that believes animals aren’t out to eat humans.
What an idiot, you need to listen to the locals.
Now what possessed you to warn him?
We need to normalize not interrupting darwins looking for their awards 😂
Stupidity at it's finest
Don't worry about him He's working on Darwin's theory 😮
Crocs gotta eat too
You tried, dont feel guilty at their stupidity
Can’t save someone who doesn’t want to be saved
Natural selection.
WhErE’s ThE SiGn?! 🥴🤦🏼
When the Australian is yelling at you for doing something crazy you should immediately realize you are insane.
Mate, you interfere with nature.
Do t warn him, it's a self.fixing problem.
Natural selection 🤷🏻‍♂️
Says the gent with on a paddle board 😂
if it doesn't have the color of a croc and it doesn't swim like a croc,.. well. Is that guy ever seen sinds this video?! ;P
Oh well, free lunch for Mr Crocodile
Thanks for trying to warn him 🙏🙏🙏 ❤❤❤
Yeah righto
There are just some people you can't help.
Man buddy was probs dumbfounded when he had to explain this to someone and was met with "let me do my thing." Would've just told him to get rid of the board and swim like a man lol
Common sense is not so common anymore 😊
Where's the rest woke people
"Wheres the sign"  Your surrounded by them
😂😂😂
When i was a kid, we went on a family trip to Australia. We went to the beach. My parents kept complaining that i wouldn't get in the water like everyone else. As im collecting shark teeth out of the sand. I filled up a coffee can. I still have the can of teeth today.
Leave him alone he’s reorganising the gene pool🧬
If he wasn’t there to warn him, he’d be a Goner in No Time
Baby blue
Sharp as a bowling ball
This is what I don't like about Australia. Everybody is a Karen shoving their noses into everybody's business.
Dumb and dumber 😂😂
I feel like theres a second part ...
Yeah crocs like fish but they love big things that look like seals.
Stupidity at its finest
"Survival of the fittest" mate..
Yeah but to be fair he doesn't have to be worried about the sharks. So that's a positive.
I'm surprised he's not American
What’s the ending of this story 😂
I’m in Australia, even the plumber who went under the house today popped a suit on to give “some” protection (spiders).  Up that end of the country you don’t even let your dog go to the edge of the water.  This guy is about to ruin the evening of the emergency services.
Is that guy on the board Australian?
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer! You warned him, I would be high taille out there!! 😳
Safe as mate.....
Let him be son😂
I do love Australians giving visitors a ‘no frills’ reality check and I’ve seen the same ‘death wish’ behaviour in South African game parks. Domkops…,
Some idiots need to learn the hard way! You did your part, you gave him a pretty non-arguable warning! If he doesn't want to listen or say a sign isn't enough of a sign for him take seriously, just walk away & see him pop up on the 7:00 news!
Let Darwin’s theory of natural selection do it’s thing
Natural selection 😆
Natural selection never rests.
Stupids are a staple diet of swamp puppies
I don't hear his voice well, but wouldn't be surprised if he's American.
It's no coincidence that the largest town there is called DARWIN.
I thought I was watching a darwin awards video
This reminds me of Trevor Noah, about Australians!!🤣🤣🤣
What a FOOL
Tourists.
Go watch a movie called Black Water. Youl get the idea what the locals are talkin about. When us locals tell you not to do something, dont do it.
Natural Selection at work.
Fcking Queenslander
Just let Darwin get his way!!!!😅😅😅
Salties 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
For God's sake is this idiot really being sassy when this man it literally pointing out the crocs around him? Where is this idiot from?  PLEASE don't say America!
Lol that man is a literal Jeff Foxworthy headline...Here's your Sign!😂😂
The English are crocodile snacks😂😂
Look up Ramrey Island massacre WWII where over NO BS 1k Japanese soldiers met thier ends courtesy of saltwater Crocodiles in under 48 hours Tell me again there's some big toothy predator more deadly and more aggressive towards mankind than Saltwater Crocodiles
Natural selection?…😂
Is that a talking blueberry ?! 🤯
He's from Melbourne,  isn't he.
He must be American. No hang on Americans are scared of our wildlife. He’s an idiot.
Dude looks like an Alien or a Teletubby!😂
Just let natural selection take its due course.
There is your ' Darwin Award ' nominee. Natural selection is on display in a bright blue skinsuit. 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
All whilst rocking some crocs.
What a di khead!
The ego of mankind ☕️
Those crocs love a gimp😂😂😂
Hopefully the croc won’t make a mess
My saying, Death by Stupidity 😅
Oh my gawd!
Oh Australia! I love you!
How dum are you you would not tel me 2 crock out at full peed  ,he is trying to save your life ,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Someone has to always warn these people personally I would have just filmed that would have been attic footage
The older I get them more I understand where Wilily Wonka was coming from. No stop..please
Why in the phoook you Ausies Trying to stop nature from weeding out the dumbphuks from the gene pool? Let nature take her course  ANYONE DUMBphuk enough to be on a tiny piece of fiberglass at water level with the most deadly human predator in the animal kingdom not maybe but definitely lurking about that normaly weighs OVER 1klbs their DNA doesn't need passing on I mean for GODs sakes 15-17' "salties" are as common in Australia as lying politicians are in America
This i how natural selection is done😂
Darwin Awaits....
If he told me there were crocs, i wouldnt be on the water or near the water.
Arguing with a person trying to save your life. Unbelievable
"There aren't any signs." Only the ones that surrounded you when you got in the water.
Most annoying accent ever
When you’re wading in the waters where crocs live and swim, you’re on the menu.
Typical Floridian
Let him get eating, just another liveleak video haha
Thats a liberal democrat on an environmentally friendly paddle board. Just let them be.
And the Darwin Award goes to…..
Being dumb is a human right
I’ll bet he’s an atheist an green supporter  😂😂😂😂
This man's next vacation? Walking safari through the Serengeti.
Bloke on the board is off his head you can clearly see 2 crocs right there in the video
That's why people get into trouble because they don't have sense.
This guy needs to start using both brain cells or it's going to be his last swim. 😅
🤦🏻
DON'T YOU DARE SAVE MY WRETCHED ENTITLED LIFE!😂
Ans the Dawin award goes to the man to proud to listen.
Yeah this guy is definitely not from the north
Aww cmon he is wearing his aqua man suit! He’s invincible!  Crocs have no chance here, but keep filming 🍿
Most Australian thing I've ever seen 😂
Easy on the gentleman people, he has a Masters degree in computer science.
And yet idiots of that sort are allowed to vote in elections of serious national importance. Hopefully, Nature will intervene and help solve that issue.  So stop interfering with Nature, you people!  Stop warning him!!!
LOL…his new nickname is Gatorbait!
God thinning the herd
We'd be taking bets😂😂😂😂
Let natural selection take its course i say.
And in this week's episode of "The Darwin Awards"...
your in north queensland, have some common sense. this line dont make sense to me because it makes it sound like common sense is region locked. location doesn’t matter. just have common sense.
Another Idiot. Go figure.
Dude if someone was kind enough to tell me I'm about to die I'm turning around. I do wonder if this dude got to watch a real nasty nat geo moment
Youre a special kind of idiot if you dont take the advise of the locals. Blue man group is gonna get eaten 😂
He is dressed like he should be there 🙄
Sometimes, evaluation gets it wrong . Go swimming and see
Darwin’s law in action.
Darwin 😂
Why no body bothers saying anything to be helpful. World has no way to Cull the Herd like use to. People are protected to much. 🤷
I was man once said a croc can’t eat you unless it’s in front of you - I’m that guy I made it up
Natural Selection 😂
You need a sign to tell you? Some ppl
It has to be a South Australian
Shut up girl
Mate common sense isn’t so common , it’s natural selection at this point
Hence so many crocs ... survival of the fittest.
I paddled around the world  Don’t try to stop me!😂
He thought the blue man group wetsuit was croc-proof
You can’t put Queensland and Common Sense in the same sentence.
Why he looks like a cut finger off a latex glove?
Some people just need to learn the hard way
That is a prime example of the type of brain a trump supporter has.
I lived up north... some tourist asked me if there was any crocks around here...I said the Sharks keep them under control a bite...😂... LoL they took my advice 👍
Idiot
This is natural selection. We've eaten most of the food the crocs and the white sharks like to eat. The least we can do is give back.
Natural selection
Go home 🏠, you don't belong in northern Australia !!! Absolute tool !!!
What a fool!
Wow he’s more concerned about looking like an idiot than not being one 😂
Mind your business, Karen. Geez, can't do anything without some Karen bugging you.
Youll never win a fight against STUPIDITY!
Forgive me for asking but is their a part 2 lol
Maybe dementia?
I hear Australian Crocs don't play.
He must be part Floridian 😂😂
To be honest i wasn’t even paying attention to this video until the Blonde started yappin
😂
Let natural selection happen
Idiot
Guy acts like he's in South Queensland! Jeez
Leave him to natural selection.
Sometimes you have to let nature remove a few cells from the gene pool!!!
As an American, this is probably the most American thing I've seen take place outside of the country..😒🤦
Imagine watching a croc grab your leg and spinning  till your leg comes off .
REMOVE THE WARNING LABELS AND LET DARWIN SORT IT OUT
We call them Bobos in France. Bourgeois descendants with an egotistical adolescent rebel mind  They love to travel and anoy the worldc
Is this guy on a woke bord
Natural selection at its finest!
Just let the man go and enjoy the show
Have some common sense that's a blue pikmin, they know how to swim
The guy on the paddle board probably believes men can get pregnant too.
I wouldn't have even said anything to the guy,who cares
how do you know which water has crocs in Australia ?  When the  water is wet.
Hahahaha ha!!! I love these paddle boarder rebels that Don give a sh***
Thank you! I was just arguing with my friend the other day about this. He claimed that concreted looked different in North Queefland. I knew it was bs. I'll have to send him this.
Rule of thumb in the Nqld and NT, they'll learn the hard way(sadly not all live to learn)
Probably a guy who voted for Kamala, then moved to Australia after Trump won
Arrogant and ignorant
😮
People are such idiots...hes trying to save his life.
People ffs
Not your f-king business what he is doing.  Keep walking.
Yes, more salties here then ever before. They live as low as Rockhampton SE QLD, at least one old female they know off. We have bull-sharks in all rivers, connected to the ocean, deadly snakes and spiders nearly everywhere 🙄
People really are foolish!
Locals warn you about crocks? I'M OUT.!!😮😮😮😮
They're not infested waters, it's their home.
Survival of the fittest.  Mentally fit.
That blue guy is definitely left wing voter 😂
Dear Aussies... This donut votes. I'd let nature do its thing...
Let him get on with it...just keep filming.
Can we see part two?
Nothing like a free lunch , ay salty ?!
😂😂😂😂😂
Come on Joey! I’m Fightin Cancer!!
RIP Steve Irwin!
Let nature take it's course..hopefully he didn't breed...
This years Darwin Awards winner.....
just tell him and when he tells you to f off, start playing the jaws theme over a speaker.
😮
Natural selection😂😂😂
No one tells him not to be dumb
BRO PICKED THE SMALLEST OBJECT POSSIBLE TO SWIM ON 😅
Filthy frank spotted
There’s crocodile in your ocean
How do you know there's a crocodile in the water in Australia? Reach down and touch the water, if it's wet there's a crocodile in there.
His my angel u say no I say yes sir
Newby in the crocodile waters well he's been warned about it nice chap trying to explain why he shouldn't be in the waters 😂😂😂😂
Has he been eaten yet?
Keep recording!!
we get these guys in Montana all the time 😂
Don't interfere with Darwinism at work!
Soon as ol mate gave me slack for trying to help, I wouldn't argue. Just stand there like 🧒📲 waiting for him to fall😂😂😂
When you stop nature from taking it's natural course you allow the defective gene pool to continue.
As a Floridian we fish in alligator infested water just to throw them back to feed em 😂
Actually sometimes it’s a good thing certain type like to risk there lives for foolishness it’s to balance stuff out 🤷🏿‍♂️
Crocodile Dundee on the knee board. Leave him alone😅
Well like they say "Natural Selection will take its course"
We're in Florida, we got enough sense the gators only come if your dumb enough to feed them.(Thank you Canadians and new toilets for feeding them) Swamp lizards wouldn't know to come to boat ramps, if people weren't feeding them at the boat ramps.    Dudes an idiot for doing that in predatory waters
Too SPECIAL. TOO WOKE!
Natural selection
He identifies as croc bait
I'm amazed this guy is even arguing
And the Darwin Awards for this end of the year goes to...
Dumbest thing I saw in North QLD was a family letting their dog paddle in the water and children play beside the boat ramp.  We said that it was dumb and the mother said “Well we haven’t seen a croc”… They were road tripping from Victoria so says it all.
He is an idiot
Guess there isn't a sequel?
Darwin Awards exist for applicants like this.
I wouldn't need to be told twice.   It's Oz FFS I wouldn't go on any water in anything smaller than The QE 2 , never mind that flimsy tea tray ! 😮
Just mind Your own Business and Let People find out the Hard way! 🥴💀
Natural selection is working. The earth is healing.
Where's the guy you warned about the crocodiles? There, over there and up there. He chose poorly.
Darwin award candidate.....
The darwin effect in action.
Natural selection at its best❤️🤣🤣🤣
This same thing happens in the Northern Territory of Australia.  Tourists, usually.  They don't take the signs seriously.  The crocs don't care. A tasty tourist "snack" is just as good as a "local"
What accent does the guy in Blue have, I can't place it.
Just by the reply you detect a fool.  He didn't say thank you for your caring.
Hahahaha peanut
Let nature choose lol
Wait a second  Can crocodile go in the ocean in Australia? Or are they on a lake ?
Salties are big and nastie
Is that a teletubies? 😂
Little smurf is a floating croc snack !!!
The moment he said leave me alone. I’d do just that and go home to watch the news.
This is the problem. Too many do gooders. Let natural selection take care of it & then less fools breed.. That's the problem in the modern world. We have got in the way...
This is what we call natural selection ❤
DARWINISM IN ACTION..
I wouldn't even go outside in Australia much less the water
Leftist for ya, common sense has left the building.
That guy is insane. I wouldn't even take a bath in Australia.
We call this  ✨Natural Selection✨
Pride always comes before the fall
Gotta quit telling people, they would be dead if people like you didn't keep warning them!!!!
The blokes from Darwin 😂😂😂
Let nature take it's course!
Darwinism
Some people just like recording everything
sometimes you have to let natural selection do what it has to do
Let him have his darwin award.
Why the heck was he wearing that blue plastic tent?
Also the snakes swim under water and there are bull sharks. I don't know if bull sharks get that far but I can imagine.  Lol
Where’s the sign..? mate, you’re in north qld, that is the sign!!
Where's the video of him getting done by the Croc
Natural selection \_(. .)_/
Telly tubby😂
If I hear word "mate" and I'm in a body of water I'm growing wings and flying out of there
Floridian here and I don't go in the water or at least freshwater here The saltwater we just have sharks and stingrays I'm good with that The freshwater all has Gators and alligators snapping turtles.. but I don't think I'd get in the water in Australia! That's another level right there..
Dude wearing crocs warning others about crocs!! Haha
Just let natural selection happen, Darwin take the wheel.
Idk if people from Florida think salty crocs are the same as fresh water alligators 😅😅 thats gonna be a rude awakening
Let nature take its course it's called natural selection for a reason 😂
Let him become one with nature
I feel like someone made up a term for this exact scenario, that was based off some pretty famous psychologist……? Eh, maybe I’m wrong, I’ll just go walk into these power lines real quick.
Let him get that Darwin Award.
Please stop. Darwinism is a thing you know. 😂
It’s so sad that people cannot take advice anymore, even when it may save their life 😞😞
Darwin 1, Human bait 0
I believe they’re called “mate bait!”
Idk how the convo started but saying hey have some common sense isn't a very kind way of saying watch out for crocs
He obviously has a mental health issue!😂
You're in Australia white man remember what happened to steve irwin
That’s crazy
Some people just need to mind their business.
Just from things I've seen on TV and the phone I would never swim in Australia. The rate that people die from crocodiles there is more than shootings in America. And then they have great white sharks too. So don't swim in Australia
What happened to him ?
Dumb ways to die  So many dumb ways to die 🎶
This is called natural selection!!!
How do you know if there are crocs in the water in North Queensland?  Answer:   The water will be wet
Thais is called “Natural Selection”. This guy gets a Darwin Award.
Yeah ocean or salt water crocodiles are very deadly.
Shhhhhh just let nature be. If we're lucky they haven't procreated yet
Leave him alone crocs gota eat
At least ya told him mate 👏
Darwin awards
Natural selection
Judging by the way he was dressed he thought to himself crocodiles don’t eat soy
"Yeah righto" is wild. Old man has a death wish and a bad attitude
If no one else is in the water, take the hint
😑
Drawin award winner. Want to gamble with his life.
People see a fool, croc sees lunch.
What is that guy even doing
Natural selection ✨
Florada man meets an ozzy
Dude. Always listen to the locals!!!
El stupedo, croc bate  , crocs don't care what their food looks like
Oye!
I be fishing on that boat ramp not needing to bring a burley bucket
He's safe,  he's got his blue screen suit on,  the croc will never see him
This man is clearly on a mission he doesn’t want to come back from. Just let him
And the Darwin Award goes to…..
Croc was like dude shut up we need to eat too
Fake news
"Yeah righto, just let me risk my life in the most ridiculous seal suit known to man"
Just leave him to it, clearly doesn't care
Crocs gotta eat too. Quit ruining it's day.
Any updates on the state of this bozo? Legs or no legs?
Sees signs, gets told, still ignores, he's in God's hands now.
If LOCALS tell you there are Crocodies around. THERE ARE CROCODILE'S AROUND!!! We don't joke, theres warning signs, and still we have idiot tourists that think its fine to surf and swim anywhere they like!!! Go ahead mate, but dont complain when they get you!! Too Aussie 😂😂😂🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
What.  An.  Idiot.  Common sense should  be renamed, because it's not  common.
I genuinely don't understand the concern. (This gene pool ain't cleaning itself) Leave him be. Crocs gotta eat, we need to clean house. Win/win.
See this every tourist season in the North. I recently travelled down to Victoria and briefly freaked out when I saw people swimming in the Murray, then my brain started working.
Just let nature take it course
So if there weren’t any signs he was going to take that as a “go ahead”?
Saltwater croks are monsters!!!
Darwin awards Natural selection
PLEASE let natural selection do its work!
So I guess there are some folks determined to be dumb in Australia too. They do get around, don't they.
Please exit the gene pool.....😅😅
Common sense is rare now days
Respect to that guy who said “ don’t blame the crocodile “
when you try to Help people you truly have to sacrifice your ego 😂
This is why they let their government control them nothing but lesser thans
Some people really hate being told what to do...
And the winner of December's Darwin Award, the guy dressed as a starved Tella Tuby 😂
Where is the dollop video?
Don't mess with evolution
Should have said there’s croc stalking you now.
Darwinism at its finest!  His wife: “a croc took my hubby!”
I've heard that alligators and crocodiles don't die from old age, but just keep growing until someone or something kills them.  Does someone know about that?
If an Aussie tell you to get out of the water LISTEN
I love people from Queensland. Met two guys from there in my city, hilarious guys
You would be relitivly safe if it were aligators. Crocodiles are a different kind of aggressive. Is they routinely eat Food much larger than humans.
I lived in Cairns for around 10 years, the Croc's are far worse now than when I lived there. This mate is just asking to be taken. 😊😅
This reminds me of the guy protesting the helmet law for bikers by deliberately riding without one. He crashed his bike and cracked his head and was DOA upon arrival at the hospital. If he'd worn a helmet he'd have had some road rash but would have lived. Some folks are determined to die while proving themselves wrong.
Thank you for trying to warn him
Please leave him alone.. It’s best to learn by your mistakes..
I GUARANTEE YOU , THE GUY IN THE WATER IS A LEFTIST …. 100% THEY ARE THICK , ARROGANT, AND EXTREMELY NAIEVE.
Natural selection at that point
I love how he says - where’s the sign!? Like oh well the sign isn’t posted serious so I’m right and the risk of croc death is negligible, bro even if you win the argument with the dude on the boat ramp u gotta win the argument with the croc?
Isn't that guy in the water Australian?
Retards love the zoo
Enter Aussie waters, you better know what's under you😅on yah mate, you do your best and let them know but the rest of their lives in their own hands 😊✌️
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🏂🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊 remember the game on Atari 2600 called Pitfall
Them things are huge, quick, ferocious and heartless.  It will grab him and all you will see is a blue blurr being twirled around before he gets swallowed
What a idiot.
Guys, he'll be fine! He's safe up there on that little floaty board.  No worries.👍
Aaaa this is when natural selection sets in
Hay !!!! The guy wants to do his own thing!!!!! So you told him where the crocodiles are let him figure it out when the croc is spinning him around to stuff him in his larder!!!!!😂😂😂😂
He looks like a blue rubber alligator toy.    Believe me when I say, you can’t help a person that won’t help themselves.
😂😂😂😂 people don't like being told.
He’s adding his own bleach to the gene pool.
Some people are just ignorant.  I love the Aussie bloke say "Don't blame the crocodile ".  You tried to warn the idiot mate.
Clown at his best wow 😢
Get your popcorn ready and roll camera. This is gonna be good.
Let my boi have his fun can’t live like a kaward
What a idiot
Get your popcorn ready and roll camera this is going to be good
".. get done by" isn't a construction we have in American English, for that particular meaning. We would say "get done in by ..."
O gezz.yum lunch
Leave him be, it's probably best we get his DNA out of the gene pool 🫡
I’m sure the croc is like don’t tell him mate. It’s better he finds out the hard way and besides I haven’t had me lunch yet.
Let him be a feed a reckon
Natural selection
Hi crocodile food  😅
I used to have this same conversation with tourists in New Orleans; different predators
HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY MARBELS LEFT😂😂😂😂😂
Can’t even go boating without the risk of a 🐊 getting a bit of you? And you pay to live there … prisoners were sentenced there…
I've seen this a few times, is there a part 2? 🙈😂
Darwin award contestant
I believe this is called natural selection. Please do not interfere with natural processes. 🍻
Remember though: it was the old man's "common sense" that told him to wear what he was wearing!! 😂
Darwin knew best
If an Aussie is telling you that you're in a dangerous situation.... its probably pretty serious.
Crock bait! Lol.
Thats Darwin Jr😂😂😂
The only cross doing any one in are the ones on the lads feet...what's up
Pratt.
It’s these type of people that disregard and disobey road  rule ,advice signs to put not only themselves but everyone else in danger.  Arrogant, ignorant?
Tourists!!! They know everything.
The "you can't stop me!" , "why'd you let me!!?" crowd.
Whats he wearing!?
This guy shld prob b eaten by now 😂 how idiotic and dam right rude can u get? I think his name is Karen lol
This is called natural selection folks
Why are we filming the ground?
😂😅😂
Darwin award
He really wants that Darwin Award.
DON'T  tell him to what to do!  That tells me You are not a GATORAID😂😂😂😂Gators are allowed to eat
Croc be like dude shhhhh you spooked my dinner!
Show us what happened? Did he get out of the water, or keep paddling?
Leave him to prove that Darwin was right.
Dumb as a box of hammers
Of course i have common sense! Check out this speedboat i bought  mate, she's my first!
I really hope that he didn’t listen to the guy looking out for him. lol
Was that a alien?
3m + seen under palm cove jetty in the last few days.All people who wish to nominate for the next Darwin Awards please attend🤣
Water smurf?
Some people don't have the sense that God gave to a screwdriver
How dare you steal food out of those croc's mouth.
The best advice I can give to anyone that visits anywhere, is if no one else in the water, its telling you something.
He's on his way to DARWIN to pick up a prize (if he gets there)
So when his leg is missing from a hungry shark attack, everyone will try to save him and he’ll pass. And the brave first responders (lifeguards too) are traumatized by this. WTH is wrong with people?? Such dumasses!
At that point ur on ur own! Crocs gotta eat! 😂
No no, let nature do its thing guys. Remove warning labels and just let things work themselves out.
Dude is in Australia and doesn't know about crocodiles in the water? 😂😂
Leave him to it buddy,some people just cant be saved,crocs have to eat too
Can’t fix stupidity
Plot twist: he was feeling suicidal
I know what he meant but gettin done by a croc sounds way worse than gettin eaten by one.😂
"Wheres the sign?" "Wheres the sign?"... my brother in christ what in the actual Frick, he does not care
@natureismetal
Hey, no spoilers. Just watch him and hope 😅🤞🏾
I loved the "Be crocwise" and "You are in croc country" signs when I was in Northern Territory and always respected them. Nevertheless I took a quick dip directly at Cahills crossing because I had cycled there from Darwin and seriously needed to cool down. Of course it was low tide and there had formed a small pool beside the causeway that was somehow sheltered by rocks. An hour later the place was flooded and the air filled with snapping and crushing sounds from hundreds of crocs feasting on barramundis. Amazing memories of Down Under!
Bloke is just upset at the bloke paddling because this bloke didn't bring a Darwin award for Captain croc bait.
Only White People 🤦🏿‍♂️
Noooooooooooo
He doesn't realize that he's part of the inciting incident of this crocodile horror movie.
Natural Selection.
Honestly I don’t blame the guy “crocodile recently seen sign” as a Canadian I have never heard of this we have cougars or bear signs at parks 😂
What a fool
Remove the signs and let Darwinism play out.     I’m trying SO hard to think of a joke involving the city of Darwin but I got nothing.
Umm, he’s in croc water and arguing with the man trying to tell him he’s in grave danger. Well, the dumb assness is world wide. 😂😂😂😂
I heard a dingo ate his baby earlier
Darwin award forthcoming.
It's OK he's wearing Crocs, well at least it's an allegation
“Where’s the sign?” In response to crocodile infested waters that he shouldn’t be in, is the most privileged first world attitude I’ve ever heard!
Just let the crocs feed...
That man is on the darwin list.
Keep filming… fk em
The crocodile nearby "Yeahdo what you want mate" 😈
Natural selection
Idiot
North Queensland and common sense are never used in the same sentence....... except when talking about Crocs
Darwin's proof of theory !
If the locals have an Aussie accent, stay out the water. It’s pretty straight forward.
Potential Darwin Award winner leave him be
He wouldn't be wearing that if he had common sense
😂 the amount of times tourits have to be told the crocs really are real, its not just a precaution and in fact there is one just over there, is astounding.
Natures natural selection will prevail.
Here’s what you call natural selection😊😊😊
You heard him. He’s fully aware. Then proceeds to see 3  beware of croc signs he clearly missed. Idiot out there looking and sounding like an entree.
Ole boy just stole a knee board out of a ski boat
Let the man feed the crocodiles 🐊 pls, everyone should mind their own business 🤭🤭
Stubborn fool.
😂 what a bell-end
You mention croc and im out in a sec
It was a seen you would not want to see again. But they were told.
He's wearing crocs, think about it...
Why, would you do that?! Let natural selection get a win...
don't mess with natural selection 😉  he will now bread and make more retards.  the crocodile is on our side.
It's called natural selection.  END OF THE STORY
Darwin smiles.
ThAt guy in all blue 💙 is Obama Obiden vota from new York City
Common sense ... it aint
Darwin will sort it out.
As a Floridian that has seen literal gators and Crocs climb chain link fences, just listen to the natives when they give you danger advice. Itll save your life
Northerners moving here to florida do this. Swimming and getting eaten/ losing pets cause they wanna walk by the lakes off trails. We point out the signs and thwy just stare at you blankly and shrug or get angry and tell you that you shouldnt tell them how to live their life. Recently saw a mom letting her 3 kids playing in red algae water that also had many gators. When i pointed that out she didnt say anything. Just waved her hand and went back to staring at her phone. Im not sure if its lack of brain power or what.
Perfect. There needs to be more natural selection in this world.
The Darwin Award is bright blue this year
Crocs are sneaky bastard's..Bull sharks even sneakier. And He's splashing around acting like floating crust.. What a duckegg!
If he gets done by the croc, how is he going to be able to blame it ? That statement just does not seem logical.
Get the Barbi out and some VBs enjoy the show
The people are sneakier than the Crocs up there
the guy dresses up like a raindrop and wants to have an attitude with ppl. some ppl are just natural born c*nts
Recent emigré from Florida, I presume...
The crocodile 🐊 expert in the background they hang around the boat ramp waiting for fish. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let evolution take its course I say.....the gene pool won't miss him.
Probably an American. We're known for our huge amounts of common sense😂
The dumb one from the Blue Man group
Natural selection in due time..
Why ya filming the ground? Really folks, feel free to have interactions without filming or posting them
Why are you interfering with natural selection?
If I guy with that accent is telling you to get out of the water in Australia . Get out of the water! Yikes!
Stop disturbing Darwin Awardees
English Karens
Good on you for looking out for an idiot.  That's some serious human decency on your part for arguing for his safety despite his efforts to put himself in harms way.
Hey if dude wants to swim with Crocs let him swim with crocs
Should have let em go... Then ya could have said.. see the sign 😉🛑
Just mind your own ...
That's exactly right... don't blame the croc for being a croc!
Neighbors watch out for each other
That's the precursor to a million dollar video
Natural selection
Why you trying to stop natural selection bro 😅😅😅
Natural selection 👌
Soon to be winner of the Darwin Award
Millennial super entitled , still  self aggrieved, and still thinking that thier in the school playground. Let the Crocodile Orderve get served up to a Big Salty.  Hats off to the fellow schooling him , A True Blue Ozzie of the old order.
😂😂😂😂
Everything needs to eat .
Maybe he was on one of those alternative suicide missions.
The part where he cuts off well if this was, I want to know what he was about to say really bad
Hey! Let tinky winky do his thing I want to see how this ends 🐊
North Queensland and the guy is dressed for swimming in tassie
If some crocodile Dundee talking dude was telling me to beware of the crocodiles. I think I would beware.
Yo if an Australian is telling you to chill…listen…
Love the crocs on your feet
People will not listen to good advice, espically when you warn them of Gods wrath that is very soon. Just will not head the warnings....
I know a girl who thought crocodiles were tiny. Seriously like a foot long. She couldn’t believe how big they get. Ignorance is a real thing. Stay safe out there.
When I worked at car rental at the airport here in Mackay north QLD, I was always shocked at how many tourists didn’t even think about crocs!!!!! One day a Chinese lady asked if they can swim in our river-I told her that yes, but I wouldn’t-there’s croc beware  signs everywhere. So after that I started telling every foreigner that got a car, to be crocodile aware.
Darwin gonna darwin...
I always say if you're dumb enough to get hit by the train. Maybe it's a good thing if you're dumb enough to swim with the crocodiles, maybe it's a good thing. I bet she's got a college degree
"it's true! The crocs love the boat ramp!" that gave me a Lil giggle
He was desperate for that Darwin Award!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️
Darwin award shoeinn
He’s trying to find the rest of blue man group
Ohhhhh shut up Karen! You’re on a paddle board! And stop being so rude to people that are fully aware of their surroundings. I absolutely hate people who really think they are the water police and I don’t agree with that. You can warn someone nicely and don’t have to force your opinion on anyone. It’s their problem like you said.
Darwinism at its finest!
Just leave him be mate. If you keep telling them they never learn mate😅😅
Every social interaction in Australia is like a good natured comedy routine , what a positive place
Bro is living anger manifest
SMURF's UP! 😎
Peanut M&M have a warning that they contain peanuts.....it's there for those types of peep
Even after the second person explains he responds with “yeah right”, uuuhhhggg!!  That person is infuriating!! For the first time ever I’m rooting for the croc
Crocodile dundee
And for this year's Darwin Awards, I nominate...
That was very polite of him. Here in Florida USA if you want a paddleboard out here in the Everglades, go right ahead we’ll just keep the camera rolling.😂😂😂
Or start off with “Hay that’s crock infested waters!!!”
My mama says crocodiles are ornery because they got all them teeth and no toothbrush!
What an idiot!!!
Stroooth Steve
'He's not letting Natural Selection do it's work, like the idiot who invented the seatbelt'. ~ala D.Chrute
There are awards out there fpr this.
This bloke is a LEGO block short of a set & he’s totally covered to protect from the sun. What is his point ?
Everyone's entitled to their own  proclivities   but i aint spnding anymore time on it
Camera man is a karen
Just let Darwinism take over from there smh
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
That's like jumping in FLA water .....it's on you !
Order something to drink , take a seat , Stay around and just filming a little longer .. 😅
He'll be doing the Harlem shake in no time!
This is called natural selection
Him and his family would definitely blame the crocodile
Can we just not let people remove themselves from the gene pool?
Not another oxygen thief 🙄
Just let it be bro. Let natural selection take its course bro. 😂
Leave them alone. They done reason. Let nature do its thing.
And the Darwin Award goes to….
Love it how ol' mate on the boat ramp had some crocs on
You did your best. Now, focus your camera on the man so we can enjoy the show.
Natural selection my friend
Ah let him go and literally feed the salties
Imagine being mad at someone for trying to save you from being eaten alive.
I love Darwin Award season
Ya shoulda just mind yalls business he ignored every sign let it be
"have some commonsense!" too much of an ask if someone can't comprehend the warning crocodile infested waters, don't swim
Sometimes you just have to let Darwin take over!
Improving the human gene pool, one naive idiot at a time 👍👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿
Darwin award finalist smh
Let nature take its course….
Shhhh Darwinism is working it's magic!
Let 'em paddle around if he wants to. Just make sure to point the camera his direction...
Let him claim his Daaahwin award
Just let nature take its course
What an idiot
We don't want to see u get bit
Please save yourself
Like telling the woman her purse is on car roof she looks up grabbing it and saying mind your own business 😂
Don’t interfere with Darwins law…
Is there a part 2? I want to see part 2.
It's Australia, don't go in the water, desert, outback, bush, lakes, ponds, trees, garage, shed, roofs, washrooms, gardens, basements, attics, crawlspace .....
Lived in a part of California with Great White, even saw ~6 footer in a reserve nearby.  I moved to the Alabama bay and have not been in the water since.  Crocs are dinosaurs
💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He’s too Australian for his own good
The crocodile wouldn't hang around where that woman in the background is.
Should’ve just filmed and stayed quiet.. imagine the vews mate!
F’em. Crocs gotta eat & it looks like Liberal Idiot is on the menu
A true gentleman!
Darwinism
"Yeah righto!"
This guy clearly knows crocs
Worried about a crocodiles reputation. Yet you don't care about humans. Not of God bud
The guy is wearing a jellyfish sting suit but gets eaten by crocs. This is called evolution.
Same guy drinks martinis on a pool float in billabongs all over the northern territory
This is what Christians feel like when we talk about Christ with an unbeliever.
When an Australian tells you to beware, you better listen.  Because those people are fearless. 😂
Righto
That be something awesome to see... The more u f around the more you find out lol..
In Canada people try to make friends with Kodiak bears in a quest for that epic selfie. Trying to warn tourists about wolverines and fishers is pointless
Man in the water is just surplus DNA.
Darwin award. 🎉 the crocs won't complain with a free meal.
How did this man make it so far in life 😂
i will never jump in the water in australia lol
Now I can't ever wear my blue stinger suit because I'm going to be confused for this clown 😂
Just let natural selection run it's course  💀🐊
MATE, PLEASE LISTEN TO THE LOCALS. CROCS SWIM IN THE OCEAN TO...........   WHAT DID ONE CROC SAY TO THE OTHER......IV'E JUST SEEN MY  BREAKFAST...... PEOPLE USE SOME COMMON SENSE.😢😢😮😢😢
Lunch
Natural Selection
That’s the most American response, he may be Australian, but Texan at heart.
Just natural selection take place. It’s healthy for the population.
Darwin people!!  Let him be..
Like talking to a Trump voter whose not a billionaire
No no let the nons learn and earn the Darwin awards...please something's gotta give in nature...let the Crocs have a bit of fun...
Darwinism at its finest lol just leave him be
Shoulda just filmed and went viral!Darwin awards
This is natural selection at its finest
Alway wondered what happened to Blue Man Group.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 gold mate
Plenty dumb people just leave him be mate...🙄
Always, always listen to the locals. How to tell if there is a dangerous croc in water, put hand in water if hand gets wet then there's a croc waiting to eat you.
I got a Queensland ACD 😅
😂😂😂😂😂
2 different passerby’s warn him of man eating crocs and the guys like… “ oh they’re just messin with me…I fear NO CREATURES OF THE DEEP!!!…Out of my way simple folk..SAIL FORTH!!..
Should've let natural selection take its course
I’m just getting so past these idiots who think they know better.   STOP HELPING THEM SURVIVE ffs!  Of course what we need is to somehow entice politicians to do sketchy 💩 they can’t see and leave ‘em to it.   THAT would be a result.
The guy just want to be food, why argue?
Let him get eaten  You were kind enough to warn him
Croc "infested" you reckon? Gotta laugh. Cairns peeps think they're in Darwin. One crocodile sighting and they're "croc infested."
yeah i think i'd rather be eaten alive than listen to a sarky crocodile dundee
When Steve Irwin is telling you to GTF OUT OF THE WATER, you might want to listen....
Why is he not IMMEDIATELY scurrying back in in panic??
Darwin’s award coming soon
If he argues, walk away. He’ll see, or actually feel, reality soon enough.
I'm in Ireland and even I know about Australia's salt water crocs ! What an idiot !
Was the guy American or British who was swimming
Stop preventing natural selection
Let him support the Darwin theory
Tourist dumb
They hang around to eat ANYTHING!!! And they won't hesitate to flip your boat over! (A yank who almost got ate for dinner!)
He just wants to feed the crocs. I don’t see the problem!!
I was in Cancun once, and a Mexican man was waving me down and following me to the point I was scared and finnaly he flagged down someone to interpret to tell me "He wants you to know your sequin bathing suit is a bad idea bc you will attract barracuda!" And I thanked them and kept swimming. I kid you not... about 10 minutes later while under water withy goggles on, monding my business, and I saw a barracuda barreling my way. I never wore that bathing suit again. Listen to the locals when they warn you!
Hey darwin you got another one on the line 😂😂😂😂😂😂
And he's splashing about 😂😂😂
I am a west aussie and new to Cairns a few years back. I needed work, so l was laying flat on my back on a cairns slipway painting the keel  of a vessel. I sat up and got more paint, and laid down again in time to see the tail of a MASSIVE CROCK going up the ramp on the other side . I finished the last couple of feet then hunted out of there fast and all the guy that hired me said was " yeah she's about an hour early today she has a nest under the dock." I would have dropped him, but he paid me $200.00 for my days work.
You can’t circumvent Darwin’s theory of evolution.   He is not meant to breed
crocs warning against crocs
Natural selection.
Future Darwin Award winner
Looks like a royal blue lunch.
Don't you have a whole state named Darwin? Or a city. I figured you aussie had it figured out. And just let the dummies get there Darwin award.
Natural selection exists.  Let nature take its course.  You did your best.
Man i hope this guy is a CEO.😂😂😂
Problem with Australia,  need a sign to effing think. No natural selection!
Darwinism does wonders
This is why Darwin awards exist.
cuz it's a woman
We need to stop interfering with natural selection.
Crocs love the taste of tourists in 4870😂
He thought they where "Be aware of Crocs" mate set him straight
Aye natural selection aint it
How do you know there's a croc or a gated there?     You see the water there.  Now there and over there.    That's how you know the buggers are there!
Forget it man, follow him and enjoy the show. 😂😂
A crock wearing crocks crocks about crocks.
Croc food
His from Tassie 😂😂
Northern Australia, crocs and sharks are in EVERY water way.😢
Natural selection 👌
If an Aussie is trying to warn you about crocs, you trust them
Next guy on faces of death EP.5
Why don’t Aussies just avoid any water besides swimming pools same with people in southern USA or any ocean to swamp that has gators or crocs
Salt water Crocodiles are massive, make sharks look like puppies.
Ignorance is bliss till a crocodile decides to eat you 🐊🤦‍♀️
Loved this growing up, so many of my references are from here. Anyone who’s upset by it seriously needs to grow up
But bad things only happen to other people. I'll be fine. F me
He is South African.... He ain't scared of crocs mate! 🇿🇦
Darwin Award goes toooooooo...
He's trying to save your life Dipstick. Say thanks and get out of the water. You can feed yourself to the salty's if you like.
Yeeeeeah, I'm the type of person to only warn someone once, with full context of the situation...THEN, you're in ya own! Afte that, whatever happens is on YOU!!!😂❤
How dare you interfere with his pursuit of the Darwin Award.
Make this the next Tourist Campaign for everyone  The dialogue is golden .
Why even bother telling fools these things.
Darwin Award contestant 😵‍💫
Not normal though he is blue ! In every sense 😂 Kamala type of fem guy
Nature has a way of eliminating idiots.😮
Let him do him...darwin award incoming.
That man should be arrested for his own safety.
😂😂😂 Natural selection is in his future!!
Why tf would you not take that serious?
What an idiot and the facted he's questioning the guy on the boat ramp they should just let him go its better the crocs take tourists than locals
Darwin award winner
Must be modern footage. Seems like the average mentality of the current age. Thinking practically is impractical lol
Man's walking around in Jurassic Park with a note on his back saying "bite me".
Make it snappy chappy. 🤪
Winner of the darwin award😂
I feel like I need to see the sequel
I will tell a grown man once.
Natural selection, croc wins   Human 🐒 0  Croc🐊 1   😅
Guy gets mad someone is trying to save him from natural selection.
Let him go
Liberal in the water
Hahahahahaha!!! Darwinism.
Darwin award probable.
25 ft long you're not going to get away Mr
😂😂😂😂😂😂 just leave him be😂😂😂😂 how dumb can you be paddling in croc infested waters fvcking lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Darwin award coming up
Most of us have more sense than this but had the man told me that with that accent I would have been out of the water before he got through speaking if he doesn't know nobody does
Wh4t 4 w4nk3r
Dumb is dumb
Charles Darwin will have the last word on this 😅.
Sometimes, you just have to let nature take it course
A Darwin award in waiting.
All tourists should be made to go to a croc park on arrival even a 2mtr croc can over power any human in the water..
How dare you step in the way of natural sélection ? Now this confused man will spread " ill dress in blue and go paddle with crocodiles " genetic in our world.
Darwin award candidate
That's whats wrong with this world! Even when you try help someone they will still try argue like just complete ignorants
I would have left when he argued back
Natural selection 👍
Is he missing now? Salt water crocks do play around 😂
You didn’t save his life, you ruined his death (Incredibles)😅
Like they say, better to let them learn the hard way then …! As the hard way will learn them.😂
florida man in australia😂
Just let the nature filter out the gene pool.
Hes not swimming, hes offering himself up on a plate for the croc. 😂
Yee fvk can I get on with you please I've made a mistake
Darwin's theory is getting verified!
Grew up in North Queensland, and he is not F@$king around. Went fishing one night, in a 12’ tinny (aluminum boat) when I was 12, just south of Cairns off of a town called Aloomba, where I was surrounded by tens if not hundreds of salties ( salt water crocodiles). Their eyes, their growls were enough to make me never even put a toe into the water let alone do what this fool here is doing. And the murkiness of the water in this clip is a clear no go for anyone who values their life.
Even the crocs cannot believe the door delivery of food… 😂
This will never stop 😂 and then they wonder why tourists disappear 🫠
He's training for his Darwin Award 😂
Survival of the fittest I think 🤔 who will win? Croc or humon?
All I want to know is if that paddleboarder was local or even an Aussie. It's tourists I worry about in Australia as they do some genuinely reckless and ignorant things.
Hear me out….let natural selection have a field day with this one
There's a reason you're there alone😂
He has the right to get eaten, don't be a Karen.
He is a strong contender for the Darwin award.
As soon as he said "yea right" i wouldve just let the crocs have em😂
FAFO
You can't stop natural selection..
Listen to warning about preditors. I lived in North queensland for 30 years hes not lying
Don’t blame the crocy mate
You should probably listen..when locals warn you, you listen.
There’s a thin line between fearless and foolish
As an Australian who has been in similar situations:  It is just frustrating that you ppain, straight out tell people not to do something for a reason (like "dont get into the water due to crocodiles"), and get belittled for it.  Or shrugged off due to "Them Aussies, always having a laugh...so much with the jokings....".  It does get to the point that, while i dont want misfortube upon anyone, but i d9nt feel sorry for anyone.
If an Aussie says it's dangerous, listen! 😂
Why do ppl film if there not gunna show anything
If a local was giving me advice, I'd be listening!
Where is the sign. What an idiot. Like he said common sense
If he wants to feed the crocodiles let him, the crocodile will be happy and collectively our global IQ will increase
Where's the sign? Must be German?
Probably trans......   😂😂😂
Process of natural selection 😂
lol come to America we swim in 🐊 infested water all the time. Granted they are usually alligators not crocs which are less aggressive but I’ve been in the water with them. 8-10 ft ones. Lol
Alright as an American i can say Australia definitely our special brother
Idiot
My man out there dressed as an apatiser.  Mate if 2 different austrailians are telling you you might be in danger, you are in danger!
As if the locals don't know what they're talking about..we've probably seen the last of paddle board guy..hahahahaha
He said where's the sign like that matters to a crocodile, I can't believe he's paddling with his hands...
Natural Selection really needs to make a comeback!
You're doing too much. Just point at the sign and hope he sees you doing it
He's dressed like one of the  Teletubbies 😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉
Darwin effect
he's a bloodyidiot
Sir if I want to die being an idiot I will die being an idiot sir
Allow natural selection to do it's work
A crocodile feast…
“I’m totally aware of it,” — those were that man’s last words.
They have effin bullsharks swimming  up hundreds of miles in  their rivers. White sharks and crocks all around.
Asking "Where's the signs??" is an indication of how fragile the modern world is that if you don't see a sign, then there is no danger. I wonder if there is a sign on his barbecue saying the flames will burn you, or is this the type of goon who will file a claim against anyone for not displaying a sign for EVERYTHING..
We have people like that in Florida. Every pond of any size has or will have a Gator but they’ll still walk along the edges without a care.
Aggggg hhhaaaggghhhhhhjwtf is happening.just let him be film the carnage and get some likes.why yell at the fool.
Just let him go it's called natural selection
"Looks like a land  fish to me" 😋 - crocodile 🐊
“I’m fully aware of it” A few moments later… “Where’s the sign?” 😂
They call that natural selection😅
Yeah they wait for fish an people dogs anything alive
Darwin award
THAT IS BEYOND PROFOUND.
That’s why humans have become so dumb WTH almost zero surgically skills. We have done too much to save the Darwin Awards winners. Let them go. Remove the warning signs let them find out.
Anyone eose waiting for the croc to appear at the end??
They do this in Hawaiian Islands too. They never listen to locals. They get lost in the mountains, get swept out to sea, sent down a river and lost and more. Then want to sue the state. They want signs “everywhere” then don’t care because “they’ve done this before” in other states.
How foolish is he. He must have a deathwish. And the arrogance shown to the people trying to advise him is palpable
You give your warning, it's up to them if they want to live or not.
Shhhh.....mate
You can nor argue with a moeroon.
The australian accent will have you both swallow your births acts anyways... so why bother about being crocodiled?
Darwin Award won by man in N Queensland yesterday for dressing like a fish and eaten by salt water Crocodiles.  Special note on Award that he was warned multiple times but he saved some Jellyfish. Noble man but not too bright.
Idiot
Don't be too upset with the guy, at least he's wearing a protective anti deadly Box Jellyfish suit😆
Natural selection people, natural selection.
Let him be gator bait. He got all dressed up for the occasion and everything!🎉
Why is this guy spoiling the crocodiles 🐊 lunch. Their favourite food- free range idiot.
Darwin is having a great belly laugh😂
Oh nore
Mind your own business
He identified as crocodile bait
Darwin award contender right there.
But he looks so sensible in that smurf outfit.
Lunch !!!!!!
Ppl here woulda just stood n watched
Is that Sharon in the background there??
This comment section does not disappoint😂
NEVER, EVER underestimate the sheer levels of DumbFuckery that exists within our species - NEVER, EVER!
Silly people do silly things
Nothing will p*ss off an idiot more than someone trying to save their life.
Europ has crocodiles?
Never care more for someone else’s life than they do.
Im irish and even i would have that common sense lol. What kinda boat is he on.? A 3footer?
Ah I love my Australian brothers and sisters, as a Brit, you can really tell they never lost their British roots when you hear the way they argue, classic British argument style, polite, passive aggressive with a good old “mate” on the end. ❤
Natural Selection😂
Ok but the other guy is also on a paddle board in croc infested water
Mehh let em go , just make sure you record the incident for us please!
The Darwin Award goes too..
Quite astonishing!
They have crocs in Australia? How do people go swimming and surfing? Just don't in these areas or?
One born everyday!
Listen to the locals 🙄
This behaviour is not a guaranteed death sentence, but it's definitely not being "croc wise in croc country".
All these comments, especially from unmarried men and women who never will understand what a married man goes through. The risks is not even high in comparison
This is these narcissistic world we live in
I kinda wish more idiots would choose not to listen to Eminent Reason, but hey that’s my thought.
Listen carefully to the accents he's not Australian he's a tourist you know where he's from he's from the UK not a lot of crocodiles or common sense there at least that shared with folks
Pelican!
"Fully aware of it" but missed 3 signs? That guy has a survival IQ OF A POTATO
He wishes to feature in the newspaper .
Darwinism
Just take all the warning labels off everything and let nature take care of these problems
Australians are the best
Well at least he had the common sense to cover up properly😁
We have Darwin Award nominee 😂
Why blur his face
Let natural selection happen
Imagine trying to enjoy your last moments on earth and some guy keeps bothering you about crocodiles.
Multiple people telling this guy, they're not lying.
This is what COVID lockdowns did to the Australians.
Don’t disturb Mr. Darwin when he’s conducting important croc research!!!
Oh my… croc bait mate!!! Dangle your foot..
I am STILL holding my breath 😬
Poor croc trying to get big Mac on a floater
What a complete phallus cranium.
Natural selection mate.🤦
And this is why evolution has stopped working and humans are getting dumber... because people help idiots like this live to have kids.
Common sense seems to be a rarity ehh.
Recently dropped my phone accidentally in a bucket of water. Bought a new one. Ain't no way I'm sticking my hand in there and risk it being torn off.
Darwin at work
There’s someone out there… that’s an F***** crocodile
The guy things he's a Blue Whale so he'll be OK??
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🐊🐊🐊😆😆
When I was in Australia in 2012 I knew that swimming in any natural water way was a death sentence.  Crocs are one thing but there’s also the massive man eating fish called the great white.
If he starts screaming do you help him? Or walk off with a grin? 🤔
Shouldn't have said anything, tourism feeds our lizards
…and the Darwin Award of the year goes to….
Same dude who's probably a cyclist and rides his bike on a road with a 45 mph speed limit
Stop trying to save people's lives. You're hurting the funeral home businesses with your empathy and compassion.
Me imagino que el sujeto que está en el agua. Escuchó decir que a los cocodrilos le indigesta la estupidez. Tiene un gran razonamiento al cual atenerse.
Sure this wasn't in Darwin? It would be easier for him to get to the awards.
Should have told him it was for the crocodile petting zoo. I hear they love to be pet just like grizzly bears and their cubs.  The signs should say no f*cking idiots
What a dullard
Definitely a starmer Voter 🙄
Listen for ticking
If an Australian is worried about me...id heed their warning immediately.
Some people just won’t be told
The guy is anit wit the croc only eats smart people
Leave him alone! He wants Crocs for friends 😂
Should of just left him alone I bet you he’s from America 🤣🤣🤣
Do you need a sign? 😂
The croc says " says I don't know what all the fuss is,. Tastes like chicken "
Years ago I was at a campground in Florida on a canal, they had a doctor that some people were fishing off of it and had a great big sign saying no swimming at all and it showed both the person and the dog on it, this guy walks up with a Newfoundland dog takes the leash off and told him to jump in the water it didn't even last 30 seconds. Florida Wildlife agency was already looking for the large alligator cuz it had attacked a kayaker just the day before.
Let the croc tell em
Why help jus watch the show. Man turns into lunch for crocs
must be a chinese tourist
Living in Florida if there is water there is an alligator. 🐊🏝️🇺🇸🙏
Shoulda let the man claim his Darwin Award after he started arguing, just make sure to record the event for posterity. 😂
Don't talk to him keep filming...
Natural selection. Let it happen mate
Neoprene isn’t good for crocs, mate🥶
Natural selection in the pipeline
This person is exactly the type that get laws and rules written. I mean thanks to this lack of common sense the government in the end insert law and rules against things just because people dies and injures themselves because they don't think.
Its also the wet season when Crocs are hungry, territorial and mating season after many months being fairly dormant in their own way.
Yet another reason why I love my couch. And bed. And Netflix....unfortunately without the chill.
English retards
Dude unstress yourself. More people die from cows in Australia than any gator.
Cookie Monster is giving 100% for this years Darwin Award 💪🏻 🏆
I mean people really make things their problem it’s astonishing
Darwin award.
Dude... Just nature do it's its thing. Darwin will thank you.
I'm not crazy! YOU ARE CRAZY!   I swim with crocs all the time! Completely harmless! 🤔🙉🤷‍♂️
Croc got lunch served on a platter 😅
I've never seen someone who needs to watch Troppo so badly.
Bruh, they are trying to save ur life, or they could just say nothing and hit record when u get dead rolled....
Let's let Darwin have his way before that guy breeds. 😅
You didn't get. He's training so hard for the Darwin Award! Never give up! You will eventually succeed!
Geez you think the guy was a tourist and he has to be and if the locals are telling you to get out of the water because there's a crocodile and he doesn't want to then let the crocodile get them and get that weak Gene out of the gene pool
How can you blame something if it kills you you're dead backyard logic
a paddeling load of crocodile dopamine
Nah nah nah... Let Darwinism teach him
Not if when 😔
Hey mate I would blame the crocodile lad
First rule of thumb about North Qld. If you don't see any locals swimming then you don't swim. Plenty of inland waterways to splash about in and swimming  pools.
"gentlemen, this is democracy manifest"
Hes wearing suit thats invisible to crocodiles.
Bro want's to be a florida man in Australia lol
It’s fake, that’s why he doesn’t show the croc  sight and makes up this ausi voice.. but it’s done in a good way! It’s all in our heads.
‘Don’t blame the crocodile’ he is saying it like its one of his old friend
Natural selection.... Leave him be !!
This dude is one huge dipsh*t!!!!
Born slippy 😂
Sooooo did he get out orrrr?
Dawin 😂
Morons everywhere
Let the crocs have their dinner, let this man be angry about someone caring about him...
Next time dont warn them. Just let Darwin's theory work into practice.
Property owner here in Cooktown, don’t fck with the lizards, they don’t have the same sense of humour as us aussies..
Fun fact moms your business and you don’t have to have these types of conversations in your life
surfer dude arguing is the reason iv stopped trying to help and im just going to watch. im not wasteing my breath on these people anymore
Would be in cairns
Bicyclist of the water.
natural selection!
Nothing like being oblivious to life saving advice.😢😢
Just let Darwinism take its Course   😅😅👌
Let the entitled moronic ponce discuss signage with the crocodile 🐊 when it turns up..
You wouldn’t have to tell me twice as a matter fact you won’t even have to tell me once because I ain’t gonna be in the water I watch enough discovery channel to know that that’s not. What are you want to be in
That guy is a cry for help
Im from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 and even i know you dont mess in N Queensland, what a 🔔🔚, to cap it off hes mad they are worried for him, what a 🤡
Darwin award candidate
That stark blue suit is as much a surrender of life as feeding yourself to primordial carnivorous beasts
I believe in natural selection and too many signs make people dumber.
Is that a kiwi dude really wow mate your an idiot make us all look dumb
You told him?!😮 crazy move hes doing
Keep quiet and keep filming...
Crocs gotta eat too dude, daaaaaaam!!!
He actually was attacked later that day but survived. Hers trying to sue the Queensland township for lack of safety awareness signs
Natural selection at play here guys   Let the idiot paddle about
Yes. Human civilisations are in decline. Stupidity is more common than intelligence
All I gotta say is Harold Holt!
How to feed the Crocs in North Queensland 😉feed'em Fuggggn Muppets🫡
Bro literally pleading wit him to save his own life, the internet is a crazy place😂
Every class has a kid that eats paste , he is that kid 🤨
Here, we see the lesser known of the species of Smurf.. "Dumb-@$$ Smurf"
Stop saving people! If they don't have enough common sense to not get eaten by crocodiles then nothing you say will help them.
Darwin Award Recipients never fail to make my day
He'll b ok in his armour plated croc suit 🤭
Have some common sense and leave him alone.....just keep filming
Apparently he's never seen JAWS!  Lookit wut happened there when they didn't heed the warning signs.  HE'S an idiot!!! Holy jeebus LISTEN TO THE LOCALS!!
...cumb dunt... ☝️🤣👉🍻🇦🇺
Darwin award in waiting.
Crocs, bull sharks, not a chance! Just like people here in the states going into the mountains that have signs of the things that WILL eat you.
Crocs be like...  We'll look at that Mate, "Uber Eats" finally approved our o-der..😂
He's an AUSSIE for Fcuk's SAKE! Just let him be!
Croc of shi* those signs (in the eyes of the paddler) 😂
Surely the smurf was an os tourist! Not an australian not knowing about crocs
Always listen to a locals advise ,eg NZ imagrate chinease  couple told not to let their child swim at notoriously shark infested spot in Aussie ,just a few  feet in the water child eaten dead ,Fijian islands big red 4 foot high sign don't swim shark's, juet 30 feet away , so off she goes ,to heaven dead .Aussie waters r dangerous. Nz the place to enjoy water sports ,u won't actually meet any Nzer tho chinease and many more cultures, not Nzer .
Maybe that guy in blue is just trying to go out on his own terms.
Show a couple sticks of dynamite in whatever floats to the top you throw on the barbie
Common sense is not very common 😂
True Aussie
This man arguing with Bandit and then had some sense when Chilli chimed in 🤣🤣🤣
Oh quick let me film. I want validation.
Dont u be croky with the croky
Proof that God watches over fools 😮
Darwin award candidate padling with just his hands in crock waters. 🤦‍♂️
... what we got here ... is a failure to communicate... Some men, you just can't reach...which is the way he wants it, so you get what we have here today.  Croc tales
Bro what do you need neon lights?
And the Darwin Award goes to….!!!! 🥁 🥁 🥁
ALWAYS listen to the locals!!!
The man warning him is wearing crocs !😆
What a drongo.
mind you bznss
You’re in Australia have some common sense!
The one who record should know how to persuade these morons by telling them go ahead, do it we dare you.
Shut up and just let em have eem.
I would have said nothing and caught it on video
Croc Food
If you have to be reminded by a stranger about something so dangerous, it would be wise to listen!
My wife and I were here a few years ago and in Port Douglas as well, but the locals were always very helpful and respectful and warned us several times about crocs.
Did they survive?
We live in a world where a growing number need a sign to explain basic survival concepts. Pretty soon those signs can have no words and only pictures, but people will get eaten by sharks, anyway, because it looked like an upside down sailboat.
I wouldn't told him nothing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Get ate up just dont blame us
Kamakazie pilot.
Wearing a full head to toe rubber suit to paddle on a short board with 🐊 😂😂😂 he must be a democrat 😂
We need to get all these Karen’s and Ken’s into paddle boarding asap 🤔
"Where's the sign?"  *Multiple people are concerned for your very life... This IS your fkin sign!*
It’s Australia, you have to assume that at any moment your going to be devoured by something.
U gave him the information he needed, its up to him what he does with it.
He believes crocodiles are extremely inclusive and accepting, he might be right.
No point in helping some people
Can't educate pork
Yeah, right. 😂
The old man is asking for it.
Natural selection in motion
Natural selection at its finest.
Wouldn't be caught dead in Australias waterways, and numbsnuts is out making an easy meal of himself😂
Let darwinism do its thing and mimd your own gd business.
For fk sake, stop interrupting and let the fkn natural selection happen...
Let nature run it's course...
People hate being told they are wrong.
If I ever heard a man with that accent talking me to get out of the water, I’m getting tf out
‘Your in North Queensland mate have some common sense’ -  I definitely would take his words to heart unless you want to only live for the next 2 minutes.
If you hear an accent stay out the water.  🤔
Natural selection at work right there. You did your duty and gave appropriate warning. Now just walk away and let nature take it’s obvious path. 🐊
Honestly, in Florida, everyone would wave and get their phones out and start tossing chicken and marshmallows in the water. Aussies are too nice.
Dudes dressed like a telly tubby… natural selection! 😅
Crocodiles gotta eat too
Just get the phone out with the video ready, make good viewing.
No matter where you go there is always some loudmouth ready to hand out advice.
"Welcome to Australia" is the sign
FAFO 😮
Righto
Never warn them . Let em be an example
Croc bait
White😂😂😂😂😂
I would say once, and start filming 😂
Theres a reason the strong survive 😂😂😂😂
I love that the guy warning him about crocs is wearing crocs
He's mad you're taking away his Darwin award 😂
Don't blame the croc
Don’t blame the bison that gores you, disembowels you in Yellowstone.
What a bell end
When people give you attitude for trying to save their lives you give them a warning and then you walk away. Pray to God that they learn their lesson xD without knowing why you are doing what you are doing.
Darwin awards ceremony.  FAFO 😂
Breaking news, Florida Man has recently been spotted in North Queensland Australia.
"Where's the sign?"  Dude, no one is policing you about whether or not you're in the water. Even if there's no sign, just listen to the local guy who just doesn't want you to die.
There is no cure for Stupidity
Given the vicinity, I can't imagine a more apt way of watching Darwin's theory in action. 😂
What a daft individual 😂
Listen to the locals!
If I was in Australia, and an AUSSIE told me I was in danger of getting eaten BY A CROC if I continued doing what I was doing, I can NOT imagine wanting to argue with him/her about it!!   Let natural selection take its course!!😂😮
“Yeah righto” was the last he said 😂😂
"Where is the sign?"  You saw it at the airport when you landed. It said "Welcome to Australia"
Maybe the guy has always dreamed of receiving a Darwin Award
I've never seen a man eaten by a crocodile 🤳 jk
He’s a lefty , leave him be … fkn hate them
Nothing is hated more than the truth.
There's at least 3 signs, saying recently seen and he's to dumb to even look at em and read em. It's insane to me how many people don't read the signs. Idk, but whenever I go to a spot especially an unfamiliar one I always read the signage to update myself in swimming conditions, warnings, etc etc etc.
Wrong area of the world to just be paddling in the water, dude has no idea
I can bet its a British 🇬🇧 tourist 😅
Its the 'have some common sense' for me😂
Those are the kinds of idiots running the country
I’ve watched enough YouTube to know - I’m not getting into any water but my shower. Even pools are filled with nasties
When a Australian man says use common sense in the water you know you are just about to die
He's hoping for a Darwin Award. 😂😂
Natural selection needed in some cases 😮
I don’t know if I’d call it a phobia, but I’ve had a terrified fascination with crocodilians since childhood. If we’re in an area where crocodilians are, there is zero percent chance I’m going into the water unless visibility is 100%. Saltwater Crocs of Australia especially give me the heebie jeebies. They’re the scariest for me.
Obviously the man cant read
😂
Todays Darwin award goes to...
Natural selection
What is the nationality of this idiot? Does he just not read Der English?
Saltwater Crocs are by far the scariest animal on this planet.
Natural selection in full effect 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣
Where's the sign😂😂😂 you're in north Queensland, it's common sense 😂
You tell them once then grab the 🍿👀
What a cu*t! After this he went to a busy intersection to yell at drivers not to drive because of how dangerous it is…Right? What about boat’s? Do you know how many people die on boat’s?
😂😂😂😂😂🙈
Darwin award
Two words. Natural Selection! Leave him be, mate.
I would’ve stayed silent after he blasted me the first time. Like “bye bye mate.”
I wonder if that guy made it back to land ? 🤔
Not an iota of self preservation. Amazing. I hope he didn't procreate, in case its genetic. Lol.
Darwin Award…
Don't argue with people who don't want to be safe 😂
There's nothing worse than an ID!0T who doubles down on their $tup!dit¥
When Karen’s want to see the owner of the swamp 😂😂😂😂
Why put the captions behind the subscribe badge????
Worrie about yourself, who saying he's gonna blame anyone or animal.
Priceless!!!!
Modern Darwinism. This man is a human Dodo, just let nature run its course.😊
This guy is almost facilitating the crocodiles in their hunt for food, by risking his own body. Paddle boat in crocodile infested murky waters in Australia?
Sometimes you just have to wait & watch the reality of someone's ignorance😊!!!!!
He’s actually insisting on the Darwin Award!
So this what darwin was on aboot
North Queensland and hes warning him about the crocs. Even the 16ft whities know to stay clear
so we not gonna talk bout what mateys wearing
This is the politices argument I've ever heard ...
Same people like that in South Africa.  Normally from Johannesburg.  Hippos and Crocs in St.Lucia. they still go in the estuary or river
No helping some people!      Yep! Splashing about like distressed critta and  potential food is guarenteed to allert the crocs you offering yourself t his menu!
Tourists. 😂
Just leave that fcukwit alone. He's old enough to make decisions on his own.
"Where's the sign?", like the crocs in North Queensland only eat at signed waters 🤣🤣
If he chooses to swim in crocodile infested waters let him, he's an adult, everybody is always trying to save everyone else from their own decisions,
Wow... how do you get that old without any sense?
Just let natural selection run its course. The crocodiles are hungry
Let the dice roll
He`ll need to get to Darwin to collect his award
Village idiot on tour 😂😂😂
As a Floridan the rule is: where there is water there is gators n crocs. Especially where people fish.
How thick and ignorant are some people
Righto
I wouldn't stick one toe in any Australian waters...
Darwin award winner.
Darwin award coming up very soon it would appear!
I think this Darwin guy had a point.
Leave the guy alone! This is how nature works. He's just doing what he's been programmed to do. Be grateful your female family member hasn't procreated with him and go about your day. If it's already too late for said female, enjoy your time with the spawn but don't get too attached 💁‍♀️
They love the murky water as you can see you can't see anything in that water. Crocs love swimming from Gladstone upwards.
Asking "Where's the sign?" In north QLD like he wants to be the reason for the sign 😂😂😂. Presume there are crocs everywhere you melon.
Y’know how toddlers cry because you won’t let em stick a fork in an electrical outlet?
Yelling about crocs while wearing crocs
🤦‍♂️Dudes worrying about a sign instead of the monsters in the water....
When TokTokers win Darwin awards.... 🏆
Did he get out after the croc information?
Just the fact that he's on the water in that thing tells us he's a ignorant imbecile😊
You've gotta appreciate their blunt honesty. Not all heroes wear capes, some wear crocs and point out how senseless you are in an Ozzie accent. 😂
Maybe he wants to get eaten.
Natural selection waiting to happen.
should be the crocs doin the watchin out
Votes left, no doubt.
Word!
I thought he was an overseas tourist untill I heard him sigh loudly in a ged up way and add 'nawh, yeh rightto' ! 😅 maybe from a capitol city.
That’s what you call a proper lemon
"It's OK. Crocs can't see blue" Dives in
Australians really live a different life
Well you are close to DARWIN, let natural selection take its course.
His wife probably told him not to go, so in his mind he's arguing with her, not you.
I like the fact that the man warning about crocs and croc signs is also wearing crocs. I'd listen to him, he might be a crocodile in disguise.
Yeah righto! Mate this man just saved u from being lunch. 🐊
I mean… if you meant to swim With the salties… have at it… I’d just prefer to not be there when they get hungry lol
blue suit must be a Democrat ......liberal ......😂
Hand paddles means just in time for a feast 😋
In the running for a Darwin award.
Don't blame the crocodiles when you get done by... 🤣 Best advice ever..
And you never seen him again
Mind your own business
You could have spoken to him civilly and peovudef the same message. Obviously need to feel ones importance
Just let nature do her thing.
Natural selection. 💁
"Where's the sign"....and that's the problem with today's society
What an absolute idiot
People yap allot. Just go about your day and let the man do his own thing, for you have confirmed he’s aware of the situation
Sounds like some sound advice to me. 🤔
That's why you have to have warning signs on everything! That kinda person.
ah well, he'll just be the most recent reminder there's dinosaurs in QLD 🤣
He was warned more than twice. It's all on him now
😳😳😳🤣🤣🤣
Let Karen paddleboard! Natural selection will handle it.
But where's the signs lol I dont think the croc cares to much for the sign
What an idiot
The Darwin awards
He not worried about his life, he is worried about the crocodiles!!
Crocodile Entrée
He was warned and informed. F**k him.
What a complete dolt!! He’s an idiot!!
He obviously didn't know. He was getting out while they told him about the crocs. Thank god for the locals.
Were at a stage in human development where helping someone is met with acts of aggression because the freedom to do what ever you want is so common!   But people will still say in times of danger "why isnt anyone helping them?" This! This is why!
When an Australian warns you of danger, then the danger is very real
Clearly suicidal because he said he's fully aware of it.
Natural selection at its best
Deadly, beautiful waters and beaches, but can't swim. Verycscary, those crocs are huge and swim in the sea
I like how he asked where the signs were and three were instantly pointed out to him.
Darwin time.
He did it for himself then posted it online that dude is 100% fine
Lol just watch and laugh.
Let the man be the special of the day!!
“WhErEs ThE SiGn??”  🤦🏻‍♂️
Crocs aren't like gators were they might eat you. They WILL eat you.
If an Australian is afraid to go into the water, don’t go in the water. If Florida Man goes into the water, don’t go into the water.
But did he live?
Recalcitrant.
Hits a point where ya just gotta let people learn for themselves 😂
Darwin's coming to collect another one.
Modern age allows for such idiots to survive. Not that long ago they would be swiftly removed from the gene pool by Mother Nature. 😂
No one deserves a Darwin Award more than this fool on his paddleboard. 🤦🏻‍♂️
There's only two animals on this planet that consider humans as food polar bear being one and yeah the other one saltwater crocodile 😳
Let the old man be right. Let him paddle out there and let him be right.
Nature's natural selection at work
Mate wants to be eaten by a 🐊.
GenX trying to help the younger dudes out and now you know why we don’t bother 😑😭
Lol he just plating himself for the croc. How polite.
“Where’s the sign?”  Is he American?
Have some common sense 😜
I am shocked he isn't a american tourist
Natural selection. Let it happen
🐊Saltwater crocks... 🐊🐊🐊aren't they the biggest, deadliest crocks anywhere in the planet...?!🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
😂
Hey leave that man be. 😂
Next candidate for the Darwin awards. 😂
Lady he's trying to help you  LISTEN
“Don’t blame the croc” it’s little surprise that a people like this gave us the gift that is Steve Irwin.
Darwin awards are well earned.
Liberals vs natural selection
Even sharks avoid the contact with saltwater crocs, that should be enough warning
Also: Crocks favo meal is smurfs
This is a suicide attempt!!!
Blimey, he's a tad snappy, ain't he
If an Australian tells you to be careful...LISTEN
Why worry? It's so many of us on the planet, even animals need feeding. It's natural.
Shiiiiiiddddd im done talking to this fool......just record him and get some likes atp🙄 😂😂
What an absolutely gigantic idiot.
Is he arguing with people trying to save his life?
While wearing crocs 😂😂
That's it, DON'T BLAME THE CROC FOR BEING A CROC, BLAME THE IDIOT FOR BEING AN IDIOT
These are the leftest ideologues that believe animals don’t attack man unless provoked. Like the shark nuts say sharks almost never attack, hate the taste of humans and eat people. During WW 2 they had to put shark repellent in life rafts and kits.. after the USS Indianapolis was sunk, a large chunk of the survivors were eaten by sharks, and shark attacks were much more common than most know.
Darwinism is required to step in here...
Let Darwinism take care of it we don’t need more stupidity in the gene pool please!!!
I can’t see how old this guy is, but it’s a miracle he made it to adulthood with such a reckless attitude.
Wouldn't go in that water if you paid me 😂
Common sense is not so common 😂
Got lost on the way to Darwin..... 😂
He want to die maybe leave him alone
He is using his common sense. Now let natural selection do its thing...
ohhhh nauurrrr what an idiot
If an Australian says something is too dangerous, you should probably listen to him 😂
Save our species and dont say anything next time other than "RIP , say hello to Darwin for me"
Like talking to a toddler
Get a 40oz Fosters chum the water and enjoy
How did he live that long? Him "Bug off! Let me die in peace."
It's OK if you let natural selection happen every now and then...
The most common sense thing I heard. "Don't blame the crock when you get done by it!"
Millenials, no common sense 🙄 go figure, try to save their buts, and they get huffy
Just be quiet and record the video it's going to go viral.
Legends say he lost an arm in North Queensland...and that was the last time he ever did surfing 🌊🏖️..!!
Darwinism should be fine here
It's all fun and games till you get 3000lb of pressure holding, rolling and taking you under to hide you for later when you've rotted a bit.
Some people just got it coming
Dont steal The crocs food .shhhhh
😂
The fact that he‘s giving you so much attitude. Wow.
Let nature take it's course. 😂
Cameraman only had one job.
I heard that, back in the day, every country was allowed to choose one of their deadliest spiders, creatures, or critters to get rid of. And guess where they dumped them? I’ll give you one guess. Now, I don’t know if this is true, but if it’s not, I’d like to officially submit this for consideration as facts.
In North Queensland, but qualifying for a Darwin Award!
I wonder where he's from? Australian? But where ?
People should mind their own business. He looks more like 50 not 15
Leave these people alone. The earth is over populated as it is. Darwins theory needs a bit more testing for some dumb c*nts.
QUEENSLAND!!! QUEENSLAND!!! QUEENSLAND!!! QUEENSLAND!!!
If you're in Australia you're just a foot away from something eating or poisoning you 😂 I wanna go there but realizing I won't survive 😅
Beauty fade dumb is forever
Natural selection
Can't argue with idiots. Let natural selection run its course 😂
Florida man on vacation..😂
These dang internet people man.
Crocs are more afraid of him than he is of them.
Ya, this guy in the water is asking for it!
I'd be afraid walk in Australia let alone be in the water
In the US we mind our own business and enjoy the nature show. Survival of the fittest, got to clean out the gene pool somehow
Darwin can have him.
Natural selection. 😉
What a carrot
Hey they’re crocodiles in the water , enough said shy argue
Crocodile done did
Usual suspects
I'm a surfer. I'm with the 🐊 Crocs. They eat the sharks. And fukin gronks like this
Kids these days: "There's crocodiles out here."  "Why you nagging on me man?"  "There's only two genders!" "Why are you oppressing me?"  "Did you get a job yet?" "Down with the patriarchy!"  "Have you invested anything into XRP?" "Just another crypto scam!"   lol You just can't impart wisdom onto these kids nowadays.
Liveleak would be disappointed with this camera guy
I would have left. I wouldn’t want to see what might be coming at any moment. Absolute insanity
I'm in the UK, and even I'm not dumb enough to think about messing with crocs
One less liberal progressive to have to deal with!
Very creative suicide.
if the man wants to die then let the man be. leave the OG alone. he wants to get eatin lol
Crocodile Done-dee.
These people put their lives at risk and force innocent people to try to save them when they get into trouble (because its hard to watch someone get eaten alive)
I wouldn't call him a cameraman....
Beyond belief and bad for crocs diet.
They're called water puppies!
Natural selection at its finest 😂😂😂😂😂
He is dressed like bait😂
Hes old enough to know, let nature take its course
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
I’d just sit back, smile and film.
Future Darwin award winner.
😂
It’s tourists, I’m the same on the coast in the uk, people want to forage fossils by/in the cliff….until it collapses on their heads because they’re too close.
He’s got his Stinger suit on …. Give the man a ticket to feeding time at any of the Croc parks around Cairns or Green island . ( keep your camera on him ….. it’ll go viral if Big Charlie sees him !)
When you hear a wildlife warning, in an Australian accent, you drop what you're doing and pay attention!
Next time, mind your own business, and film the attack.  Darwin Awards winner!
Guten Appetit Kroko😊
Darwin Award participation
This man’s next video will be posted on live leak 😂
Fafo
Just chum the water. I mean why not? Guy is asking for it
Hey mate,thanks for warning him!
"sorry for trying to save you life mate, didn't realise you wanted to die."
Gotta love tourists!
When ya get done by it!! GREATNESS!
Another future, proud Darwin Award recipient right there 😅
Australians take white liberties to another level.  Yeaaa croc an a sharky mate whata about it 😂😂
leave him to be food - evolution in motion
A wise man sporting crocs is a wise man😂 listen to his warnings
Absolute fool doing this at a north qld boat ramp and then when they get themselves eaten or severely mutilated they blame the animal and want it killed like it isn't just doing what's it's species has been naturally programmed to do for the past few million years 😂
Ffs in Australia I'd double check my bath before getting in
Yep righto! 😂
Listen to the locals
what is it that makes people beleive they will be ok in water occupied by predators
🐊
I just don't understand why you'd even waste your breath. Keep your trap shut and enjoy the show.
Think that was an American 😂😂😂😂
Democrat
I'm so pleased for once the idiot didn't sound like a Brit u can't blame us this time 😢😢
GENIUS!😂😂😂
Natural selection, let it happen
Ths is the type of per person that will complain that why the authorities don't move the crocodiles so people can paddle board in peace .
"Where's the sign?" IT'S NORTHERN QUEENSLAND! THEY'RE IN EVERY BODY OF WATER!
Your boy is dressed like a blue gummy shark
Darwin Award recipient
Sit and watch
Don"t say anything and for godsake man KEEP FILMING
Woke up as eaten
Just let natural selection tickets course don't say anything to the guy lolol
This guy seems to have been dropped on his head as a lot as a child, or maybe as an adult.
Let him go he seems to know best 😂😂😂
“Theres no crocs here. Show me one!”
Is Dad's name Darwin, by chance?
in Australia you Know when there's a Crocodile in the water when the water feels wet!
Always good to see the dumb ones take themselves out of the gene pool.
Maybe he doesn’t want local wildlife to go hungry that day
Imagine being this rude to someone that’s just trying to make u aware of basic safety because u missed every sign before getting into the water. I saw let him be a crocodiles lunch, he’s earned it!
His suit is so beautiful.
You did your best. Now let Nature take it's course.
Trump voter on his first vacation off the farm….
This sounds like me and my guardian angels when I don't listen.
"No, that a f***ing crocodile recently seen sign."  Golden
Plenty of tiger sharks in north queensland as well. It's the largest tiger shark breeding ground in the world
Some people need to learn the hard way
Darwinism
AND using his hands for paddles smh thats like ringing the dinner bell
I love the team work. You guys are angels
Is that another foreigner or do we have a home--grown dill in that water?
The second the dude started arguing back, I'd have finished with, test your darwinism and good luck.
The man knows he's wearing Crocs for God's sake
Idiots don't die nowadays, they breed more idiots
Typical lib. Please let him go.
Natural selection let crocs fix the gene pool
this man is single i can guarantee it..
I think he was just confused because you’re wearing crocs.
He's not got 1 ounce of sens..
We have people like that in the United States too...... they're called 'trump supporters.' Most are nice people but as smart as a buket of bricks.
Atleast talk properly to him, thats why he got offended.
Sounds like a yank and they are  always right
take the advice
I saw 2 Crocs
How did this guy survive long enough to get gray hair is my question
I love when people say things like I was attacked by a shark I'm always curious like where were you when said event took place what like in the electronic section in a target or a home goods store or where you in the shark's natural environment like say the ocean
Why does this seem like the start of the tale of “Florida Man goes Down Under”. 😂
Just goes to show stupidity is international. Like the tourists trying to play with the gators in Florida. When one of these idiots gets eaten they blame the poor gators.
Glad to know it's not just America that's full of morons.
plot twist: dude was trying to be eaten by a crocodile. 🐊
Leftard
Another herd thinn8ng moment
Oh he gonna get done alright
Salty gona get ya salty gona get ya
I wonder what happened ????
Just let natural selection do its job please. Thanks
Both parties seem like party poopers 😂
DONT BLAME THE CROCODILE WHEN YA GET DONE BY IT. YOUR IN NORTH QUEENSLAND MATE HAVE SOME COMMON SENSE.
Another tick tocker bites the dust?! 😂
He's after a Darwin Award.
It’s your hero condescending demeanour that’s making him not want to listen.
Sometimes I wonder if it's better to let idiots get taken out by nature or not. I mean if you're an idiot and do something that may get you taken out do we need to stop them?
What’s more annoying than idiots doing idiot things is people becoming Karens over it
Love how he's clearly worried about Jellyfish and not 17ft reptiles
At least they got him on video before the attack.  Now others will know what happened. 🐊
He looks and sounds  like a complete spanner  🤣🤣🤣
This guy is a complete idiot for what he is doing.
Is he suicidal? 😮
He's signed up for the "Darvin Award"....😊
Potential Darwin award winner?
Darwin award... I guess cross gotta eat too though😂
One there, one there, and another over there and ten more that you can’t see!
Just let natural selection do it's thing..
Everyone knows better!
What’s the Aussie equivalent of “Where you from you don’t know gator?” “You don’t ’spect gator, gator ain’t gon’ ‘spect you!” 🐊
He's definitely going to blame the crocodile
FOOL.
Common sense for this guy tells him if there’s not a sign warning there won’t be any crocodiles.
I'm from the UK, and even i know about this 😂😂😂
Imagine trying to reason with an idiot...
Didn't blame the crocodile when u are dinner.
Fafo
Could we not let nature run its course?
Just let natural selection take place
Tourists...
There will be one less kook in the water
Dude older aussies the second they hear a women they instantly sound tired of it and get condescending it's hilarious, the way he said "yeah"at the end killed me
Bro thinks he’s at Bondi 😂😂  Get outta that swamp bruh 🐊
Darwin’s theory excellently illustrated 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Its better to not help these people.  With any lucky they are done in by their stupidity before having children
😂
Humans put animals in hard situations and then blame the animal.
"Wheres the sign?" You need a sign to tell you crocs infest pretty much every mudhole in Australia?!
He's middle class mate... He has NO common sense 😂! He's arguing with a local... He's right and everyone's wrong, questioning everything the nice bloke is saying😂. He can't even agree when someone's trying to save his life😂😭😭
Let him. Idiot.
Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience
I was expecting a "its ok mate, i accept the risks." But no, hes just got the iq of a rock
Whys he wearing footy pajamas in the ocean
If the locals are telling you not to do it… you probably shouldn’t do it 😂
He'd be a Happy   Chappy giving Mr Snappy a Rubber Packed Lunch
A guy on holiday with his wife went to the water to wash his hands after making dinner, he never came back, nothing was heard nothing was seen.
Natural selection. There, that should cover it.
Commonsense doesn’t exist anymore .. let him keep flippn and flappn around like a blue Smurf … 🙄😖
This is like take out for a croc....they can be like 18ft....
As soon as he showed attitude...'ok have fun' and save the video for the news...well...he might inspire some kid....sigh...and here we are...
The second he started asking about signs and arguing over how clear they are id of left him for the darwin awards 😂😂😂
And if you try this in northern Australia you'll get a Darwin award
So you mates have a lack of common sense over there then to , I see !
You Aussies love telling people what to fo
No, no, no, no, no,  just let nature run its course. The signs are posted. He made his choice. Just let it be
Maybe he's from Darwin  (Tenuous joke about natural selection)
Croc bait
Keep filming, you'll get some amazing footage..
"The Crocs aren't allowed to be here, there's no signs!"  As if your first thought would be about signs when someone tells you that you're putting yourself on the menu!
Lil man, the crocodile warning signs are just a prank, you should just go out there and enjoy the weather, the water and have fun for the rest of your life 😊
Blaming the signs 😂😂😂
Welcome to the food chain 🥩
Let them fight
Must be an Aussie from Florida.  😅
My grandma lived by the beach and got sick of buying dogs that ended up croc food
"BUT, BUT,...but I'm dressed all in blue, mate." "Crocs don't eat Blue!" "They'll think I'm the Sky, and CROCS! DON'T! EAT! THE SKY!"
There’s no helping some people, what a fcktard!
Some people were born to prove natural selection as cold hard truth.
This is what I mean by removing all the warning signs and letting our species progress. The intelligent will thrive while the ignorant will be consumed by the earth
Confused why this was even posted ha
It's a candidate for Darwin Awards 2024
is that xqc?
This is a typical Covid conspiracist
😂where's the sign....like the crocodile is gonna read it
Croc bait, man obviously thinks he’s smarter than the crocs & the signage. Idjiot
You can't help him, he doesn't want to be helped.
IDEOS Mate
What happened next ?
The amount of people that don’t pay attention to their surroundings, complaining that’s there’s no sign even when there is and in multiple locations.
What a DHead
Natural selection folks😂
It's called natural selection 🤷‍♂️
Darwinism
Been in Cairns once....awesome place
Let nature take its course.
If you are constantly interfering with evolution by saving those tards, you are tainting our gene pool
Aussies are dumb in general
🦧🦎🦎🦎
You can have similar troubles in Juarez Mexico after sunset
He wants to be friends with crocs. Karens need worry about themselves
Hah!! Let this old man be.. if he likes to play "natural selection " i say let him!!! GB
Dawin award
I love the way they says crocodile
Today's Darwin award winner is....
Australians and people from the South have an extreme similarities. Definitely not the brightest but they both know what they’re doing in their element.
When we were in Australia we went swimming in the ocean and didn't see the box jelly fish sign. A local pointed it out. I didn't have a spare second to be rude and ungrateful. I was to busy soiling my self and then swimming to shore in a panic 😅
Gotta love libs, clueless people.
Meh, Let him win the darwin award
Love the passive aggressive Aussie vibe
Personally I’d be reluctant to get a bath in Australia, just in case
"Where's the sign?" Nevermind that, because crocs don't read, they just "do their thing. Until they are full, then they take a break."
In Australia, every puddle has a croc in it, just like every puddle in Florida has a gator.
Some people are just destined to be croc food😂
An Example Of Pure Stupidity..👏🏻
I would not have said a single thing, just watched the magic happen. STOP PROTECTING RETARDS
He's from NSW.
Natural selection. Just let it take it's course
Wears a stinger suit but doesn't give a rats about crocs. Righto. That must have taken some solid brain gymnastics.
And the thing is he’s  paddling on the smallest Boat imaginable 😂 You just can’t tell some people
Lemme tell you you something if I’m in Australia or Florida and a local tells me to get out the water, I’m gunna start crying cause I know I’m about to die😭
Why are these people interfering with Darwin while he’s doing his job?
Bro I wouldn't go near the water in cairns lol
Poor man! He didn't realise! Now his fun is ruined!
My man is angrier about someone trying to keep him from getting killed than a 2 year old who desperately wants to climb a top heavy bookshelf but you keep telling them no
Leave him be !! But keep filming .....
Don't try to explain. Let natural selection run its course.
Oi That's just crazy. Was he a tourist? I can barely hear him speak.
Imagine dying whilst wearing those VFX pajamas
He's about to get a lacoste sleeping bag! 😂
Getting done by a crocodile is crazy work 😂
Ahh you tried, let natural selection do its thing from here
He's got a right to his beliefs. If he thinks it's safe he's entitled to his opinion. It's rude to interrupt his experience of the world.
Anyone who wears crocs cant be trusted. Carry on.
Imagine getting annoyed as someone for them trying to save your life
You couldn't pay me enough to get into any body of water in northern Australia! 🫣
Most Australian video ever
If someone told me about crocodiles in the water, I’m getting out. They even told him about the posted signs.. 😂
Smh....im in NC and it's pretty much the same with alligators just gotta becarful and alert at all times in a good amount of areas but this man seems to have no survival instincts and quite hardheaded lol
Exactly!
He gon F.A.N.F.O. from a salty?! Ain't noooooooobody coming to save you bro, you just gonna be food at that point. You've been warned.🤷🏾‍♂️
Thank you for not showing me someone getting attacked.... which I'm sure happened eventually🙄
Funny how pple refuse to take advice from locals who know the area. Happened on my island.  Oil company wanted to build a base on east side of the island.  Locals told them it wld not be viable because of weather etc.  Oil companies?knowing better than local yokals,  built the supply base however  Lloyd's wld not insure any vessel to go into that harbour.  The huge sheds now rented out to locals to store things
Cant belive he is arguing to let him die😂
Whilst in Oz, please listen to what they tell ya.
Where’s the sign that says crocodiles are allowed here? This is a croc free zone.
Natural selection
Stupidity is everywhere remember these fools have no common sense!
“Yeah, righto “ 😂😂😂😂
Darwin at its best
Darwinism at its finest 👌
I'm glad America is not the only place we have idiots😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol
Darwinism in action   Dudes about to create some extra living space and food for people in one swift move
Fairly advertised... Just keep filming now for some " snuf content
I bet they didn't see him on the way back 😂
Between crocs and killer tiny jellyfish, I wouldn't even get in a boat
Darwin runner up! I live in Florida and don't go fn around in the water! There's a sure way to know if there's a gator, if it's wet more than likely a gator is there!
"I do my thing and you do yours" as man does one of the single dumbest things you could do in not clear water. 😂 leave the man be hes trying to earn his darwin award
What a winner
Mind your business mate
We have this problem here in Florida where people get into rivers, lakes, ponds, even canals with alligators.  True, our alligators are smaller than and less forcefully opportunistic than your saltie, but people still get injured and die.   They're just so clueless or want to "pet" everything like they're the ultimate animal whisperer. It's particularly disconcerting for me as an environmental educator, too.
I’m from Florida, definitely more aware of gators than sharks. I just thank god the crocs usually stay in the more marshy areas and don’t venture out to the boat ramps here. Australia is on another level.
Salties study our patterns for weeks as well. I’m surprised mate wasn’t taken during this video
Let the dinner to enjoy the SPA😂
😂 The perfect example of the IQ of the average AUSWIPE. The same people they laugh at how dumb Americans are.
That’s the exact same type of genius that walks up to a wild bear to take a picture with it
I'd want to die too if it wore that.
Leave him be, clearly he wants to be eaten
Natural selection.  Why stop it..
A fool and their life are soon parted.
Let the croc have some lunch people, they’ve gotta eat too😌
What blue and white and red all over?
Natural selection mate. Leave him be.
And the Darwin award goes to….
Must be from  Victoria
Guy must be from florida
Let nature take its course. We don't need more of those.
To be fair, crocs and alligators  DGAF about you at all. We swam with them in eyesight in FL rivers many times as kids. They wont bother you. Now, you step on one, or mess with a nest, or just get unlucky, I suppose. But bites are pretty rare
And the Darwin award goes too..😅😅😅😅
just leave the guy be man mind your business 😭
That's about the dumbest conversation ever heard.
I'd trust the advice of the native queenslander wearing the crocs
This is northern Queensland, but it's about to be Darwin ✝
Perhaps he was on a suicide mission
These privilege arrogant idiots. I actually wish for him to meet Mr crocodile.
Natural selection should prevail in this instance lol😂
Leave em, if buddy wants to get attacked by a croc then it’s his problem 😭
I like these videos. From the board guys perspective, you and lady are just Karens. From your perspective, you're legitimately trying to save this mans life.
My man looks like a teletubbie. Tinkie Winkie.
We salute natural selection and its fine work even millions of years down the line 😆
There are obvious signs of mental illness
It is probably one of the worst ways to go, his been warned, like the guy covered in petrol that wants a warm by the camp fire. Just don’t look when he goes up, not pretty.
Mate don’t waste you’re breath if he don’t care about his life then why should you I’m surprised how he gets this far on his life if his brain is the size of a chicken
Has anyone here seen the vid of that dead croc on the beach being eaten by a shark? The most Aussie scene evaarrrr!
Natural selection at work
Unbelievable
The big ‘ salties ‘ 👀 out ?! He can’t be from North Queensland!? Gotta be a tourist from down south or WA. Anyone from North Qld knows about crocs
This is the world we live in today. The man is upset that somebody is trying to care for his livelihood for him actually staying alive. And he gives him an attitude because this man is trying to warn him that this place is full of crocodiles
Let him get ate . For Gods sake man let nature take its course.
Idiots will be idiots. 🙃🐊🐊🐊
Don’t warn him, let natural selection take its course…
To the people trying to warn the guy , please don't stress  your body with people with mental problems .  Its not worth the aggravation on your Heart .    What do people call it ? Darwin Award ?  Good Try .
Guy taking the Darwin Challenge. Darwin is undefeated. They should ask why.
I would appreciate the information for sure
Typical dork…. I wonder who’s the first person he’ll call for help when he’s getting munched by the crocs ? …..the lad making the video ?? 😂😂😂
That attitude is how you get the Darwin Award.
Most idiots argue to defend their stupidity. I leave em to it
Gotta love natural selection
I would say let the idiot demonstrate natural selection but someone will be fishing bits of him out of the water or watch him get eaten. So inconsiderate
I've never hoped for someone to get taken by a saltie, until i saw this.
*You can see two crocs when he points the camera down*
Typical young ignorant kid. See, there are a lot of crocs taking down people like this. All the crocs christmases come at once when they see idiots wanting to get eaten alive !?
Just change the signs. Try, crocodiles consider tourists a tasty snack, ya never know.
And that was the last time anyone seen him? 😂
Does he think his full body wetty will save him 😂
Film it
Only crocs i seen were on the concerned man's feet
What happened to him?
Please let natural selection take it's course
If he wants to identify as a chew toy, I say let him.
Natural selection 😂
Oh, and you are dressed like a bluefin tuna ! Dinner is served!!!😂😂😂
This Smurf wants a Darwin Award.....croc will support this initiative😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stop helping idiots natural selection will take care of him
Leave the dude alone, whats the worst thing that can happen... nothing that bothers me.
This person is obviously Stupicidal.
Let natural selection take its course. Gotta be a liberal
Why blur the almost Darwin Award recipients face???
I mean let the man paddle lol, not your problem
I bet the guy on the paddle board loves to get v@cc!n3$ too.
Just be quiet and watch the show
This is why I swim in pools. You can see the boundaries and the bottom
A few years ago a dude said, "Fk the alligators".,when he was warned. Last words.
Crocs were probably looking at each other and scratching thier  heads.
Imagine meeting a Saltwater Crocodile 🐊 when paddling around on that little board ? 😱☠️
Some people are just beyond pedagogical Range..
The guy obviously wants to die.
He doesn't have enough human meat tho
I have been to Cairns about 12 yrs ago, and there were signs all over the place about  crocodiles.  We wouldnt dare to even stick our toes in the water. 😅 crazy
And they might never be seen again.   Common sense is completely missing here.
If a Florida man or an Aussie tells you get out the water don’t question it just get out 😂
Ironically the guy giving the warning surfs with Great White Sharks.
You do you you get chomped you wingnut!
Its not common sense to know about queensland's crocs
He's off his head, this fool
If you want to do this, Australia is not the place.   I'd say some of the only truly safe beaches are in the Mediterranean and even then they have their fair share of dangers
Plot twist: the croc got the guy on the dock.
As a crocodile I find this insensitive, we have to eat too you know
You just let it happen i mean the time it takes to talk him out if it is like 4 times more than it takes for him to get eaten and realize he messed up don't blame the croc remember blame the swimmer
Full video please
Ill be fine...
!!!!!!!!
I love Australian accents I could listen to those people argue all day.
Don’t have to tell me twice
😅
Let tourists tour. 😉
I live in South QLD. North Queensland is absolutely chock full of even deadlier creatures, including massive, aggressive crocodiles.
Why are you trying to save this people. Let them go.
Ok but also, how is it up to you?
Some people are just their own worst enemies…
Imagine being a Karen when someone is literally trying to save your life from one of the most terrible deaths one can endure.
I see that not only Maga-trumpsters in ´Murica have serious cognitive disabilities....
Darwinism
To be fair, the warning sign advises not to swim. It doesn't say anything about dressing up like a smurf and getting on a knee board.
Weird
Stop trying to save people.
natural selection
Gonna do himself a mischief! Righto
And crocodiles r just the first thing u should worry about… shout out to that PM RIP Bozo lol
Poor crocs need to be protected from these idiots
A "normal" person would thank both these great people.
All the Crocs are seeing is a giant blue sour patch kid floating on some debris 😂😂😂
Ah you see now. Where your whole "where are the signs?" argument falls apart when you realise that crocodiles are unable to read and even if they did, they wouldn't care. But you be sure to tell the crocs all about your sign theory.
Thinks he'll get famous on TikTok.
Blimey mate!!!!! there’s a couple crocs right on your faueeet!!!!!!
Oh man, I'd be asking can I get in your boat lol. Smh
Darwinian.
Stop saving people from their own stupidity. Mother nature will sort this out.
Again someone who just can’t be wrong
You know…I knew better…but I’m from Florida
Saltwater crocodiles are ornery because they have all those teeth and no toothbrush to brush them with.
Someone is actually trying to win a Darwin award.
Dude don't play with natural selection
This guy is lizard bait, this is what you call survival of the fittest.....😊
As a species we have failed
I’m sure he has all of his jabbed at least.
You tried to warn him 🤦
If the water is wet there is crocs in it
Ask an Aussie Catholic Priest, if this man dies by croc attack he won’t get into “heaven” as it’s essentially suicide to do this in Northern Australia!
Meh! bruh! everyone gone soft! when I was a young fella growing up, we would go swimming in the Barron and mulgrave river only the fresh water parts not in or around the mangroves or the river mouth. The river mouth that's where the crocs hang out most they don't go up stream much cuz boat activity. I've seen big Saltie up in small fresh water creek's all through fnq mainly small Crocs but a few years it won't be small somehow getting up the creeks maybe when young and during a flood. I'm guessing but having said this salt water crocs can get into fresh water creek and remaining for years undetectable so to make my point finally after a big rant any salt water river like this at the river mouth even small amounts of salt is a no no to go into in FNQ. You'll die from croc if you don't you're going to get stung really bad by jelly fish. take extra special care in fresh water in fnq because that's where people let their guard down. thinking no croc is in the water. They watching you. Please believe they are there. Think again. Always assume Crocs are watching you. Salt water just never touch it unless inside a stinger net just my advice stay out of the salt water and be very careful in fresh water. Edit: To add one thing about salt water crocs in freshwater it's because steve Irwin many years ago got a law passed to put croc as protected. Fun in theory. Dangerous in practice. They get into fresh water and hybnate for months at a time. Crocs are way out of control. They're everywhere. You shine a torch at night. You'll see.
Always listen to the locals dummie,
Darwinism never stopped. Never will. Idiots forever
Wow, let him go since he acts like he doesn’t know about those big salties 😅😅😅
No good deed goes unpunished! 😂
😂😂😂😂
Good job mate, likely saved a life.
The Crocs love the Boatramp😂 Just like people in Crocs
Shane Gillis
Shhhhh your stoping a good meal...  let them find out we need to let it happen.. bring up IQ levels again..because people like this will b far and few.
There's more than one Darwin in Australia😂🤣😂
This is the most Australian thing ive ever seen.   Someone having a go at the level of ifiocy of another trying to help him out.   Then the other bloke having an aghhhh theres warning signs on everything these days  she'll be right stop being a girl vibe 😂  Even ends the convo with a yeah rightooooio
Just wish him a good swim and keep filming.
He's wearing an irukandji suit but not worried about crocodiles 😂
My wife fell into the water on a fishing trip on the Daintree. We got her back in pronto but I'll never forget the expression on the tour guide's face after the incident. We sat there in silence for about a minute and the guide said, "I thought you were a gonner. Somebody say something funny.", so I asked him if he thought the airline would refund me one return ticket. He didn't think that was funny.
Leave some for natural selection...
The Kamikaze Kid cometh.... Otherwise know as Lunch🤣
Next upload Man on board in  Blue suit  MISSING 😮😅
C'mon mate, why intervene with natural selection?
One hour later...
Dude, natural selection was working. Stop saving these people. They need thinning and gods trying his best, but the internet has shown you to be compassionate.
What an idiot.  “I’m fully aware of it” 😳  I DONT THINK YOU ARE!  Someone is trying to (quite respectfully) save your life and you have the sheer audacity to talk back like that.  And then to actually double down about signage. 😳  I’m sure that if a crocodile were to come up to you,  Simply arguing with it about signage will definitely save your life.   🐊 - oh my bad, you didn’t see the sign?  I won’t eat you. Fairs fair.
Sea animals can sense changes in vibrations miles away. He’s essentially ringing the dinner bell.
crocs love to sunbathe, those boat ramps are probaby perfect for that lol
Crocs thinking no don’t have common sense I’m hungry
Some people just gotta find out on their own.
I'm from the United States and never been to Australia and I wouldn't go into the water. Sharks,sea snakes,blue ring octopuses are enough to keep me out, let alone a saltwater croc.  Its almost like the most dearly of everything lives in Australia.
That’s a true legend warning him and that’s an prime example of natural selection  waiting to happen in the water
If an Aussie actually bothers to warn you..  fckn listen, mate.
I don’t think I’ve ever wanted a crocodile to eat someone before I saw this…
My body, my choice
Some people just have no survival instincts they the type of person to die first in a apocalypse.
Look at the water to its blue but it aint clear the last thing he'd see is a dark shadow..... That man is a fool
Just another tourist, crocks have to eat some thing! Leave him.
Next time, let natural selection play out like it's supposed to
Natural Selection… nature wants him to be food!
I think she called him a particular group from WW2. Which is crazy even saying that in the uk sends you to jail. I wouldn't wanna live like that.
Okay YouTube warrior
Dont interfere with nature. Cmon! Everyone knows this.
this is how liberals in America act when you explain logic to them
Where's the sign? It's the one that said Welcome To Australia
"But there'd be signs" Imagine being so feeble that you are going to risk your life in spite of people warning you, based on your self assured feeling that there are no signs in the area therefore it must be safe because surely if it was dangerous someone else will put a sign up, right?
He wants to have a paddle and isn't scared of crocs, I respect that
that is called natural selection i believe. let him go
Mate, you're not BatMan. You're Bait Man.
Not just ANY crocs either lol
This terrifies me. Did he make it back?
I wanna know if he even makes it to shore.
Exactly. Dont blame the crocodile for being a crocodile
Natural selection fella 😂😂😂😂 Step off and admire Nature at work 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Darwin Award recepient
THATS where Joe Biden has been lately.. 🤦‍♂️
Shhh,  Darwin is busy with this one.
Papa Smurf: "Im fully aware of it... where's the sign? Aussie: "One there, one there, and one over there."
Bro, you’d be one of 10’s of thousands today of a video showing an ignorant person getting killed by a animal feeding itself. Mental health is so bad that people play w death!
Just the fact that this guy has a wetsuit on, in water that’s probably 80°
I tell the kids you're being watched up here
We saw a 5m croc at Weipa
As if the crocs check for signs when they do crocodile stuff😂
It’s ok natural selection will play a big part in what happens next and a bit of stupidity will be removed from the Jean pool
There's a crocodile out there wearing nice blue shoes, and its missus has a lovely blue handbag! 😂🤣😅
You idiots, he's got his blue suit on, crocs don't like blue suits. He's  fine.
I lived in cairns for a year. The crocs are more common a bit further up the coast but they are there. I swam in the sea a lot too. Lots of flooding and an increase in their numbers has made it more dangerous recently. The sea crocs are also swimming out to islands where they were not seen for decades. You have to be careful
That's Crocodile Dunthinking, he's a living legend. Oops, sorry, he's now just a legend! 😂🤣
In Nth Queensland wearing a full body wetsuit. Say no more.
If someone told me this I'd probably freak out and get out as fast as possible.
People are definitely getting dumber !
You can always spot the liberal
"You're in north Queensland, have some common sense."  It's Queensland where rational thinking goes to die
Let natural selection have its way mate...
Let me guess a woke lefty 😂
I live in Cairns and kitesurfed for 20 years in the same area, nothing to worry about
The guy is literally paddling like a turtle or some other prey and he’s arguing with people who are actively warning him about the visibility of a crocodile recently seen sign rather than saying “thank you! I didn’t see those signs; they should make them more visible. Thank you for saving my life!”
Don’t warn him. He is just thinning out the gene pool..
Survival of the fittest
Typical white man not listening cos the locals aren’t white
Just let the world do its thing.
Minding your own business cost exactly 0 of your time and money.
They aren't trying to ruin your day becuase they are nasty ppl they just don't want you brutally killed.
Channeling stevo
And??? Did the crocodile get a feed???
Some mothers sure do have em
Theres 2 good size crocs in moon river,patrol between yorkies and bluewater. Old mates kidding himself paddling in there
The logic that he can swim there because there is no sign even after being warned about crocodiles is so crazy lol this guy deserves a Darwin Award
A republican trying to talk common sence to a demoncrap..    why do we even try
Determined to prove Darwin’s theory is correct😂
Sheer ignorance
Just keep filming can’t fix broken every time
Apparently professors have discovered crocodiles don't like hanging around with people in bright blue suits. Humans don't like it neither
Fekn dumb😢
He chose his fate 😅
I think Darwin may have underestimated Aussies by a fair amount.  Some people say everything in Texas is out to take your life, I suggest they learn about Australia before hanging that bad rap on Texas.
This is SO FRUSTRATING. my wife has been here from korea 18 years and she agrees with his guy and we are having an argument as to if there were really crocodiles " the government woukd build a barrier"   Oh my god.
😂🤡
Nature has a way of getting rid of the weakest. Carry on mate! 😂
Just warn him, then leave him be. If it was ignorance of the danger, then he'll get out. If, as in this case, he's an idiot then natural selection will take care of it. Either way humanity wins...
“Where’s the sign” what a complete tool 😂
🎼 I do what I want! 🎶 No one can't tell me nothing...
must the Australian equivalent of a democrat
He has his blue anti-croc suit on. No worries!
Stupidity at its finest
When I was in middle school they called 'natural selection'.
Where’s the sign? Like the crocodiles can read signs.
Used to live in Richards Bay, South Africa and the signs by the river going into the harbour also warned about crocs along with sharks and hippos.
QUEENSLANDER!
The fact that there is NO ONE else on or in the water seems to escape this twit. 🙄
I live 12,000 miles from there and even i know not to do that in North Q
What a clown 🤡
This is why Florida has open carry laws when fishing. This guys is asking to get eaten by one of two things, considering he is dressed as a seal. Crocodile or Bull Shark. Equally unpleasant and both will fight over prey so get out of their lunch box.
WhErEs tHe SiGn?!  Well... an aussie is worried...  There's your sign...
It's good to warn people it's another thing to try and ridicule someone if another man told me have some common sense we're going to have a problem
"Everything here will poison you, maul you or asphyxiate you to death. Your own shadow will grind you to a fine paste if you so much as give it a funny look - remember, this is QUEENSLAND".....😏😎
The I can do anything I want attitude…gotta be American 😂
I can see two crocs on the doc 😂
Common sense is not so common.
Shh 🤫 next time Let Darwinism do its thing… humanity becomes smarter everytime ppl are removed by their own stupidity. I mean Boogie board paddling with crocodiles is highly recommended when visiting crocodile infested areas… ffs 🤦‍♂️
Dummies Guide to Suicide, it's on page one 😂
What’s even more hilarious is that’s he’s got the suit on to protect himself from box jellyfish… I wonder how effective it against a saltie
Croc be thinking: “hmmmm a blue merengue floating my way, I like merengues!”
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dumb mannnn
I lived in Cairns in 96, I wouldn't swim off the coastline.
Why even bother trying to save someone with zero common sense that wants to argue
People really need to stop getting in the way of natural selection
Sounds like the guy paddling has a more British accent. Imagine being an Aussie and having a Brit argue with you about your home territory.
Crocs don’t really care about signs
At least he got dressed up for dinner 😅
Natural selection at its finest.
Did he live ? Oh right i don't care
Crocs actually hunt humans, still remember that story about the 3 guys from over there, one of them got caught by the croc, the other 2 scrambled up a tree and that thing stalked them all night until they were rescued, I think the river flooded on them or something, must’ve of been horrifying knowing your buddy was just eaten and it’s wanting more!
To be fair the suicidal guy is right. Let him get on and feed the crocs. He's paid his money and now he's making his choice.
Guy clearly wants to be 🐊💩
Darwin award.
Crocs would be thinking- whats the catch?
Crazy Yep I’m a Queenslander
People in the comments comparing alligators to crocodiles! 😂
Listen to the locals. Being eaten alive is a bad way to go.
Imagine needing a sign 😂😂😂
Evolution in progress... Survival of the fittest!  This guy won't be passing on his genes
Ol mates in crocs
Northern Australia is salt water territory period.
That's probably the way he told him undermining him and the person got and felt disrespected
Aussie
The next addition to the Darwin Awards.😂
Natural selection
Let natural selection take it course
its crazy how different your saltwater crocs aggression is compared to our American Alligators. Gators are ridiculously chill unless you are seriously bothering them or are a small child/dog (meal sized) Crocs are demons in comparison. We get a lot of invasive species from hobbyist reptile/amphibian owners down here in Florida and I REALLY hope saltwater crocs never join that list. I love kayak fishing at night. Id probably be dead in a week in Australia
As a Florida native that guy made himself a nice takeout dinner😂
Proof of natural selection.
Natural  selection
A croc warner wearing cross, Meta!
Dont be a d!ck just inform him and be on your way
I can picture the guys talking holding the camera. He definitely doesn’t have any teeth and he bashes his wife.
I can’t understand what the smurf is saying, but maybe he didn’t know???
Perfect opportunity to ALLOW evolution to prove its not just a theory!!😂😂😂
Darwin award recipient in the making.
Let him win the Darwin award
Let natural selection work it's magic
Typical boomer
Kids these days are completely deluded
Who argues with someone trying to save your life?
Natural selection…….no woke …lefty losers ….idiots….in the animal world 😂
But did he die though?
First class Darwin Award winner here
I bet he voted Labour...😂😂😂
Why argue. You know where you live. What its known for. Thank the guy for looking out and have a merry day.
Awh so cute let me swim to that lovely animal and cuddle . I can see they love me . Ah give me a kiss
Natural selection running its course
Lucky man. I would've started chumming
he paddle like a animal in trouble😂
Who cares let natural selection do its thing
When your ego won't let you get saved.   🤯
Ego can be life threatening
I live in Queensland. Crocs are no joke 😂 natural selection I say.
Crazy. Boat ramps ARE where they hang out ffs 😂
Leave him alone.....the crocs have to eat too. 😅
Where's the sign that informs the Croc.
How does one Aussie have to school the other about crocs? !  Same as Americans.  People just don’t seem to educate their kids about survival.
Queenslanders think all South Australians act like this
Just leave him 😒
If an australian tells you something is scary and risking an attack from the wildlife stop doing it as quick as possible and pray youre fast enough...
If they insist on going, take a video mate
If it was a sign saying Dabger death from falling over cliff he would agrue with you. Common sense is not common mate.
Hard to believe that he's reached the age he has.
Free country,if he wants to feed the crocodiles let him
He's trying to qualify for a Darwin award!.... 🙄🐊
You can't go round hurting anyone's feelings  However the crocodiles don't follow the woke brigade
I wouldn't have said a word. I think one of the reason there's so many morons and health problems is natural selection isn't being allowed to do it's thing.
Think of the views and click ya would get if the croc got him.just leave hin😅
The only Crocs i see is on his feet 😝
Natural selection 😂
😂😂
Those aren't just any crocs, either. Saltwater crocodiles are a different breed of nasty. This guy is a fool.
Telling someone they're about to die and their best response is, "where are the signs?" 😂😂😂
Wheres the sign?
How thick can a man be.
Bro, you can’t fix stoopididy……… You did what anyone else would have done, warn them.
Crock food , 😂
Making the Darwin awards as literal as possible while also likely being a double entendre.
QLD don't claim him 😂 must be from NSW
Dummies don't last long in Australia
Honestly, shouldn’t of said anything. The guy is clearly brain dead. We don’t need people like that walking around and voting.
Mr. Chum
Darwin is pulling his hair out here ..'I'm trying so hard..arrghh!'
For this very reason no matter how hot it was up north. I never swam
This is called natural selection 😂😂😂
Old dudes know everything...just ask them. They'll tell you they do.
He is being honest ❤
Bait in a swim suit is still BAIT . What a Numpty
‘Where’s the sign!?’ That guy is a nice contender for a Darwin Award.
The worst part of this situation - If this wombat was taken by a croc, the authorities would cull the croc because its the law.
Billy Connolly would have a field day with this material 😅
Bait the area. Bring them in. Wait.
He’d last about as long as a snow flake in summer.
Wow this dude is twice as d*mb as the d*mmies that go saltwater fishing in a tiny plastic kayak.
Aussie mens accent is so laid back sounding  Aussie womens accent is so abrasive. Like nails on chalkboard
As a North Queensland boat ramp expert, I can confirm this man is on the crocodile menu.
Darwin's theory. Let's all keep our mouth shut.  Let them find out the hard way. More room on the freeway for us. 😂
That paddle boarder is a complete muppet.
Only a fool wouldn’t listen to an Aussie scared of animals. Prolly knows something you don’t
The man thought it was A Logodile
Animals are always getting punished because of idiots like him.
There's nothing around the island continent except for sharks and Crocs. Not gators which is bad enough but freaking crocodiles which are basically giant dinosaurs😮
Honestly can tell who parents took time to raise them
Arguing with an Australian when he's trying to let you know there's a genuine prehistoric flesh eating predator hanging around waiting to turn you into a snack is about as dumb as it gets
Darwin
I wonder if he wanted to feed the sharkies or feed the croccies?
Why are people so defensive?  He was giving him life or death advice and help like a decent human being. Instead of thanking him and taking note, he complains.  My grandmother always told me "the person that does not listen is the person that becomes croc food"
Crocks, don't hang around the water's edge for fish. They are waiting for any nice size. Mammal to come and play in the water. Or have a drink.  And the signs don't keep the crocks away they can't read.
Natural selection in action
For some reason, German tourists seem to love swimming with north Queensland's saltwater crocodiles. These things are terrifying (the crocs, not the Germans)
When a Queenslander suggests not playing in the water😅, and no respect given, I imagine ' crocodile tearing and the torn in real tears.
It’s just natural selection. Let him carry on.
These people can vote 🤯
Call me evil but i wouldn't say anything.. let natur take its course who am i to stop natural selection
They did the crocs a massive disservice there.
Dude reminds me of my ex wife. Arguing just to argue. Youre literally trying to give them life saving information and they just want to argue ...lol
Well at least he is sun smart…
I call this letting nature take its course 😊😊 im all for taking warning signs off and letting nature take its course
Tourists have that extra special tenderness.
Go and pet that dugongs snout before you get out mate,over there its good luck😅
Someone who has no brain
Complete idiot
"Where's the soign?" 😂😂🤣🤣 thats a crocodile recently seen sign!
Anytime your in Australia.....think of Jurassic Park. Your the lunch.
Make natural selection great again !
Twist: croc swims up and man yoinks it.
The do gooder filming is probably from Melbourne.
Lived in Darwin for a while.....this guy is NUTZ.....HEZ IN SERIOUS WATERS!
Should of encouraged him to stay in after the first warning
I would never swim in any aussie waters
Mind your own business
the woman shouting sounded like every zoo worker giving a presentation on animals
Just post the gory video , mate
Oohh ... just leave this Chumm alone.
Yup fug that bs I'll just stay in Texas where we ain't got crocodiles 😂😂😂
He only has to worry if the crocodiles are hungry!!😂😂😂
Only in Australia 🌏
I came across a german tourist years ago in northern territory cooling off in a river right in front of a crocodile warning sign. He said there weren't any around and if he saw one he would exit the water. Tried explaining to him that he wouldn't see it coming. I dont even live in NT , i'm Vic, but well aware of the risks.
Leave him alone...crocs gotta eat too
Can't  Understand  Normal Thinking😂😂😂😂
I've never seen a man so upset at having someone not want him to die.
It's called genetic cleansing
Natural selection sorts out the dumb ones and stops them reproducing.
arrr say nothing, grab a coldly and pretend it's the refugee regata and enjoy
Facts.... but why do you care? Like going to he effort of filming him too.... just move on with your life mate
Let them feed
What a idiot
Natural selection
Why do aussie womens voice always go up at the end of a sentence so that it sounds like a question?
More and more lunatics in this world daily.
Don’t blame the crocodile when you get done by it” is crazy work
Brilliant
You tried my friend 😂😂.  Let him get dine by them😂😂❤❤
This guy has absolutely no idea how much danger he is in,  sometimes arrogance = find out and he really doesn't want to find out,
Australia is a giant no swim zone
That’s the biggest telatubby I’ve ever seen
Seee ya
Just let natural selection take hold. 👌
Natural selection at that point 🤷‍♂️ one less idiot in the world
Dude let him win the Darwin award. He obviously wants it.
D-head .
Natural selection is a thing
All  I can think is the view through tne cross eyes like a seeing a sandwich float by missing the top piece of bread.
Seriously crocs are everywhere in Cairns water. I am from down South and when I visited Cairns you didn't see anyone paddle boarding in the water. There are signs everywhere.  Just like tourists who ignore the no swimming/rip signs and then expect to be rescued at beaches.
Oregonians warning people not to turn their backs to our ocean... cause the whole thing is gonna getcha!
Have some common sense!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is it the worst thing to just let those ones go for a swim? Especially after being warned.
Where’s the sign ………
You just ruin someones lunch
Wears a full uv rashvest to protect himself from the sun while showing ZERO concern for crocodiles.... Deep sigh...
I only saw one salty in Australia. Taronga Zoo. Dude was a giant. Don't want to meet one in the wild.
Must be careful not all Aussie are this kind ,I would have just winked g'day bud while pulling my camera out in anticipation 😂
White liberals.
Darwin hard at work there lol
No matter what…he was Darwinning that argument…🤭
Salty say's look a snack with self Delivery
Darwinism…
If an Aussie approaches you cursing, they probably try to save your live.
Let him be. We need smaaaaaaht people in the gene pool.
Typical tourists 😂
Some people have to learn the hard way, so dumb they walk right into a salt water crocodile's mouth, these crocs have been known to wait for days to get a chance at prey, they are very patient predators, and intelligent. Crocodiles have pattern recognition for times of the day that prey is available, this guy will make a nice snack.
you can hear that woman clapping as she's yelling at him😭😭😭😂😂😂
Let him win the Darwin Award
Expedite the process
How quaint,...guy has a death wish.  He needs a Public Guardian.
It is pretty funny. When he just says, let me have fun.. and they are like. .. mate you might die, it's not about personal space.
If an aussie says the water isnt safe ...it probably isnt
Local knowledge is gold
I'll never understand why people even bother trying to help folks like that. It's like trying to talk a skydiver into staying inside the plane. Just let them do their thing and if they die, so what? 🤷🏼‍♂️
What a muppet! 🤦🏻‍♀️
Ofc its Cairns 😂
Free snacks mate 😂
I wouldn't even bother warning him.
I'm a Kiwi who lived in Cairns for 9 years. You're nuts doing that! Several people were killed by Crocs round the northern beaches when I was living there. Beautiful place but deadly also
That’s crazy
How nice of him to serve himself on a floating plate ! 💀
Good man mate thanks 🙏
In Darwin he would be arrested
At least he has his stinger suit on😂
I bet the paddle man is a liberal 😂
When an Aussie tells you about the “Top End” you listen
You know you are really dumb when an aussy tells you to smarten up
'Where's the sign?' Like if there isn't a sign saying danger there isn't any danger, solid logic. Some people are too domesticated.
As an Aussie we don’t often advise others about our wildlife. But when we do LISTEN TO WHAT WE ARE SAYING !!!!!
Where's the part 2 lol just kidding. Hope the guy listened. 😂😂
You cant fix stupidity.....
That's some nice concrete.
The word is he came Back the next day an hasnt been seen since just his board was found
What a karen , let the man be fish food
I live in Ohio and I was scared to get in water in Texas… not a chance in Florida or Australia especially
He must be an American.
Reminds me of that jingle. Dumb ways to die…..
Ah man, I normally try to croc a funny joke at this stage but there’s too much material  Beyond parody
I live in Florida, I can't believe i still swin in some areas around here xD
Someone is trying to get the last Darwin award of the year
😂 bet it all turned out just fine, and he's probably still doing it karen.
If the swimmer is American, he probably believed he could out swim it or beat it in a fight
He'll get done by it before he blames the croc
In all honesty if you get done by it then its impossible to blame it when your dead
Darwin Award candidate?
This sounds off topic, but bear with me.   I have been searching for used windows on Facebook marketplace. I would drive a little farther for the perfect sized window or a very low price.   A man posted some windows for a high price, in a location far from the major population, and said "I dont know the measurements, if you want to know, measure them yourself."   I sent him a polite message just letting him know that he might have a hard time selling them because of the distance/price/measurements thing.   Of course, he didn't add measurements or lower the price. Because I suggested it, most likely. And because of his pride i noticed his ad is still up (its winter now) and he was eaten by a crocodile.
Bro aussies are built different, if they are telling you not to do something, you should probably not do it
My Queensland buddy says it's often a German tourist who gets done by the crocs.
"Where's the sign?" Well you're in Australia, you're on water and there's a guy shouting a warning at you. How many signs do you need?🤣🤣
Let Darwin decide 😂
For heavens sake man! LISTEN TO THE LOCALS!!  If they're worried about you, then YOU should be paying attention to them.  Do you want to become an appetizer for a modern-day  dinosaur?
Hey he's lived a long life,if its his time to meet his maker cant fight fate
I need a follow up
You fool, let it happen for the views m8
Wheres the Sign   LOL   Your in N. AUSTRALIA
I don’t know what to say😮
But he looks so flashy and cool obviously a jedi
A crocs favourite colour is blue
Don’t mess with natural selection
Great camera work
This is what we call, Darwinism.
His choice to become a snack.
When I was in queensland I didn’t usually go with in 10ft of a river. The crocs can see you and you can’t see the crocs
Next minute.… 🐊
Why is he totally covered? He’ll be croc food before he gets a chance to get sunburnt! He’s worried about dying young from skin cancer whilst he swims in croc infested waters!   What a goose.
Darwin scoffs at the man trying to help
"Where's the sign?" Can't stand people who resort to that. There's no signs for stupidity (they'd run out of room).
Looks like yorkeys
If the locals say dont swim, dont swim!!!
It's his choice to leave the gene pool.
Can’t tell if this on the verge of natural selection, or top contender for Darwinism award…
Try chumming buddy
Grow a pair and jump in
He probably wanted to speak to the crocodile Manager
A true Darwinian moment.
Oart two is bro getting eaten by the gater
So, what was the tastiness rating by the crocs?
I doubt he's Australian 90% sure 😂
Why are those Karens messing with the local crocodiles? Let them eat!
Can you imagine living a place where temperatures hit 120 f° and you can't swim? Maybe extinction isn't so bad afterall.
Oh don't worry he won't blame the crocodile he'll be done! Common Sense goes a long way! 🫣
Euthanasia is illegal, this is one of the loopholes.
Thanks mate for drilling it through  This mate..
LoL 🤣
Darwin award recipient, I hope the crocs are safe.
Warn them, then video
Justin Trudeau visits Australia
Crocs like ignorant people
If you live in -Qld- Australia, you don't need a fkn sign to let you know it's folly to swim in certain places. Moreover, if an actual human being is trying to impress upon you the danger of swimming in croc waters, complaining about a lack of signage is...crazy.
I feel as if natural selection is possibly a good choice with some of these people
Most of us Aussies know our country is full of hidden dangers. Now in my state we don't have crocs, but when I travel up Queensland I dam well know they are lurking around.
I suspect a Darwin award is going to be earned by this fool.
Oh boy 😬
Keyword there bloke common sense not many people have it
Crocs gotta eat too😂
Always follow the advise of the locals. Do you know how many people drown here in our rivers? Enough and they are most of the time  not of Dutch origin.
Got some nice big saltys down the way! Don’t say I didn’t warn ya 😂
Darwin is ready with a trophy for him.
He’ll been fine. He’s an Aussie. It’s the crocs who should be worried
Dumbarse immigrant. Got No idea.
Depending on how far north  Whether its a croc or a shark  Or they get into a blue to see which one gets you first
I visited Australia…Cairns too…and there were several people out that were there just to warn you about crocs in the ocean
Or she sharks lol
I think if he had said it better, the dude would have recieved it better and acknowledged his mistake.
What the ffkk is even that...?
Maybe he wants to die?
if an aussie says it isnt safe..ITS SPECTACULARLY DANGEROUS!!
Obviously he hasn't seen your Crocs
Oh are there any sharks. No........ There used to be some sharks in there but the crocodiles cleaned them out.
Look tell him there's this great place in the Northern Territory called shady camp great boat ramp he'll have a great time on that paddle board😅
Another confident idiot ruining the good name of crocs 🐊
But seems obsessed with sun protection
Their no crocs its just my sleepers..😮
What a Drongo !  They're ONLY TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE MATE !!! 👍🐨🇦🇺
Bob katter was right!
Take all the warning labels off.
Darwin had a theory about this
Just let natural selection do its thing
Guys got a death wish!!
Bro looks like a creepy teletubby
How has this man survived long enough to be old?
Isn't there a place in Australia called Darwin?
Darwin award nominee
Aussies are great
Common what ....
snacks for the pretty fishy things!
For Sale: One blue on white Paddleboard, used once on calm water. Some light scratch marks on top front. Selling for health reasons.
Just let him go its a waist of your precious air and time you wont get it back and he is obviously running out of his dont bother just trun around and fish and when you heard the big splash that you expect you will just think (aww its nothing) hes fine and go on with tour day
I didn’t think British people had crocodiles, petty cool they named a whole place after the Queen though
Looks like a right wolly anyway whats he doing.
I travel to Cairns and Darwin often, and every two meters on the beach you have saltwater croc warning signs with clear big writing "ENTERING WATER WILL RESULT IN DEATH" with giant signs of skull and bones symbols, drawins of humans being eaten plastered all over.
But he’s in a blue suit they don’t eat people in blue suits
Wow
Dudes from Austin
Darwinism in action. Stops his gene line if the cricket dies him.
Don't say anything to these people  it's called Natural Selection
Worrying about crocs is a waste.  They're expert swimmers, can run faster than you, and if you happen to climb a tree to escape, they can wait for you for three months.  So, good luck. Worrying isn't gonna help you.
He's baiting the crocodiles mate. He wants to be the next crocodile Dundee. 😅😂
It seems people have lost their common Sense these days that's hilarious
Crocodiles: "Mind your business"
We have a lot of people like this guy in Australia they swim in waters that a normal human with logic would never swim in
Yet, he's protecting himself from marine stingers like box jellyfish😅. Id be more worried sbout sharks and crocs. I live in Queensland, i wouldnt swim in the ocean.
Would have been an absolute violation if he had of been smilin!
"No, that's a fkn crocodile recently seen sign" 😂
I'd like a follow-up please!
This guy telling people to have common sense is peak hypocrisy.
Time to remove the warning signs and let nature do its thing.
"when someone tells you who they are... Believe them the first time".
Idiots gonna idiot.
Salt water crocs scare me more than anything else in the water. One of the smartest, most terrifying predators on Earth and that idiot is serving himself up on a platter, looking to win a Darwin Award for his foolishness.
...
His paddling with his hands like that is essentially beckoning the crocs. It’s like he’s calling them over to him.
You can't let fear define you 😂
Mad cuz he’s more Aussie than he is.
What a kook
You're doing the exact same thing he's doing tho...
The guy warning the smurf about crocs is wearing crocs 😂 😂
Wooow..
Fully aware and recently missing 😂
Its nice to see other places in the world are lacking common sense too and its not just America
The crocs we saw on the shore at shoal water bay training area were insane. Monsters!
Dumber than rocks
Sense isn't so common y'all 😂😂
Sometimes, you need to let nature run its course
Boy that's good camera work😮
leave him lol
Another genius alert!!
Bro don’t mess up the natural selection in progress!!!
He reminds me of the foreign tourists who visit Yellowstone and attempts a selfie with a buffalo.
Under the water they have signs for the crocks that say free food
Leave the man alone  Crocs gotta eat something
Crocs be like. " Good news. Tourist s."
What an idiot.
80 years old no common sense.....how?!?
I live on the other side of the globe and I plan to keep it that way
R.i.p steve irwin, the new generations really need his info. Im from the uk and i wouldnt dare go swimming in queensland thanks to steve ❤
Sounds about like dealing with a Yellowstone Tourists; dumb af
Geeez just let natural selection take place.
Please let nature do his thing  Those idiots need to disapear
After I saw that guy get turned into a manwich by a shark in Australia, I would never get anywhere near that water
I say let natural selection take it's course 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is the same mentality of people in America who are being handcuffed while saying "I didn't do anything, I'm not doing anything" while being caught red-handed on video.  Idiots.
At this point let Darwinian theory take over
Lol i grew up in Gordonvale i use to spend every second weekend up at Cape trib i use to go for a quick swim in the beaches up there. See a croc will generally stalk you for a few days first watch you as you come to the waters edge and it will then stalk you and attack so going for a quick swim is not as dangerous as ppl make out. However its time tge govt put a bounty on crocs at a certain time of year and let ppl hunt a certain amount of crocs per person per season. Because they have no predators and they are slowly migrating south again it won't be long and you won't be able to swim anywhere. Its an industry that would let some of us make some money by hunting crocs. 🤷‍♀️🙏💜🕊
Can't say you didn't try.
Who's putting soy in the Australian water? 😂 Let the man risk his life, it's a free country. Worse than being forced to wear a seat belt, i swear.
If he's already reproduced, no Darwin Award.
Aussies and Swamp People. Listen to their Croc stories!😊
Croc bait 😅😂😂😂
Is he trying to get a life insurance claim or travel insurance for his family ? Not anymore... Now that this video is out. Salties will get dinner. Family gets none.
There is idiot born every minute. Crocodile s are basically leftover dinosaurs. They love MEAT ,Any kind, especially  human! Human to them is a delicacy!  Salt Crocodiles are the worst killers. Most people have had such a cushy, spoiled life. They cannot believe a nything bad could ever happen to them! Their denial is to the  point of delusion.  The key behavior that identifies such people is; they love to tell people that they are the leading foremost authority in,? Whatever, monopoly, mma, ancient alien,historian, pyramids, any topic.  They are expurts!!
Even the women knew better.
Dementia
You know it's dangerous when an ozy is telling you it's dangerous waters.
I love the Aussies saving the tourists from the big boys. He's paddling away in his Smurf suit; I think tourists are oblivious to the facts about crocs, especially how widespread they are in rivers & oceans. I'm also afraid of sharks, box jellyfish, blue-ringed octopus, irukandji jellyfish, stonefish, etc.
Why tf is he even going back and forth. If anyone told me there is crocs I’m OUT that water so fast
Typical southerners
If this were Florida, the guy warning the other guy would be called a Karen
Next summer he'll be at Yellowstone national Park petting bison
The paddle boarder is leftie for sure.
Point the camera at the subject......smdh
Don’t try to help him. He knows everything. Let natural selection happen.
Natural selection
Definitely a liberal
Yeah righto..   😂
If only i had a chum bucket filled to the brim
😂😂😂
Wish people in rhe USA defended gators like this
Theirs a difference to trying to save a mans life and trying to record a man to humiliate for YouTube to see so the man in the drink was probably frustrated to be recorded
If Floridians, Louisianans, or Australians are being cautious, you should be terrified 😂
Next time don’t say nothing just keep filming.
Natural selection!
Cameraman failed the assignment. The assignment was to lay in wait and film the moment the crocodile got em lol
White people issues. 😅😅😅
Break out the camera and watch the show at this point
Natural selection is a beautiful thing.
Imagine arguing with someone about saving THEIR life
Unbelievable of he doesn't listen and continues then I only have one thing to say to his family /friends. How Else Did you Think This  Was Going To End. Regards from the UK 🇬🇧
He’s from Florida
Wn AN AUZI SAYS GET OUT OF THE WATEr. Get put  as fas as you can
Leave him but keep recording him🤣
Common sense isn't important here. It's education of the fact what crocs can do and where they live.
SNACK FOR A SALTY. LOL
@martyandmicheal
And RIP
PETA should get involved; the crocks are likely to have stomach issues digesting that blue suit he has on.
But the crocodile needs to eat
He's on a Suicide Mission!!!
Just let natural selection do its thing
he's not going to complain about the crocodile doing him in hes gonna ask why the croc didnt follow the sign
Tourons of North Queensland
Fuckn tourists really dont care for safety
Wheres the sign. There, there ,rhere and there.
What a spanner
😂
Hey man, don't stand in the way of natural selection.
You think you look like a professional sports enthusiast but really you just look like fish food 😂
If someone with an accent like that tells me the water is dangerous…. I’m going to assume the water is dangerous.😅
Kind not nice 😂
Julst let nature take its cuase 😂😂
A Darwin Award in the making! Crocodiles eat what's available. Idiots make themselves available!😂
Nature's birth control
No m8 .....no 🫡
😮 crocodiles live in oceans?
This is natural selection at work, just get out of the way…
It's giving... he's asking to be eaten😂😂😂
🤔 Sometimes natural selection just hast happen.
MAAAATEEEE 🤦🏾‍♂️💀
Usual stubborn culprits
Let Darwin have his
Mind your own business? He clearly doesn’t want your help. You just want to be heard
Let the crocs uber eats alone.
...yeah ive seen and heard enough about Aussie wildlife to know that if an Aussie thinks something is dangerous then I'm listening 😂
How did that isiot survive this long with 0% common sense. People like that you dont argue with. You warn them then break out the popcorn and wait for the action.
Well I take he was all good coz he didn't get eaten
You helping him will probably get someone else hurt tbh.. best not to interfere with nature
a true australian. just like the people in florida. the crocs and gators dont want humans and if you lose a limb not the worst thing that could happen
Nothing about that man shows common sense 😂
So the guy hangs out and film's dudes death and people will say why didnt you do anything haha the world is in bad shape guys
Rekon he told him “don’t do it “, then when he back answered he started recording.
Wow
Nek minute ahhhhh my leg ahhhhhhh farrrrkin helllp me
Its a horrible fearful death
Imbeciles every day 🙄
Bro, why are you arguing with crocodile food?
Don't blame the crocodile when you get down by it😮😂😅😂❤😅❤❤
And the Darwin award goes to....
I want to go to Australia so bad but I am terrified. I feel like it’ll be Jurassic park or journey to the center to the earth or something
Natural Selection on it's finest
Some people just won't accept advice
Shhhh let him be. Let nature take its course
Pr1k
Must think the stinger suit will protect him from crocs
Bro let evolution run its course
Anyone who doesn’t take locals advice when their trying to help you out gets a D stamp 😂
Stop arguing let em know an go if he gets bitten that’s on him
Typical suspects 😅😅😅
Let me do my thing. Classic down fall of society
Ain't no way.
Just let nature take it's course
the only reason the crocks don't already have him is they think the blue dufus is a ruse for a trap.....  They'll work it out soon enough it's a cleverly disguised flamin idiot, one of their favourite food groups
Just let him go, hes obviously not gonna listen.
Should be common sense not to go in the water in Australia.
Let idiots be idiots .they are so hard headed vecause they are brainless. Just watch as they paddle for their life with a crock chasing them .jajaja i hate people that dont want to listen or read dangers and want to do wat the want to do. Brainless at their best
Dont blame the crocodile when you get done by it
Tourist are a delicacy to crocodile and bullsharks ... something they get once or twice a year 🤔 lol 😆
Ant your business is it bitc_ your a snitch bitc_
Sir you really shouldnt...you know what sir, go right on ahead there
Me a couple years ago trying to explain with facts to friends and family why they should avoid getting the "jab" at all cost. Beware of the crocs in life!
Well at least he has his stinger swim suit on 😂😂😂 it just goes to show that you don't need to have a long neck to be a goose 😂😂😂
I say we remove warning signs and labels from everything, lets let darwin figure it out...
Maybe he should take  the hint lol
Just a matter of time...
Darwanism at its finest 😂 You tried. Thats all you can do
There is a 100% rock solid guarantee that I would NEVER do that...that is something you can hang your hat on!
We had some shark attacks on our beach in Florida last year. The day the water ban was lifted ppl went back in. Only thing was the sharks hadn't left. Ppl had their kids between them and the sharks taking pics. They said "Facebook said it's okay" So I guess when social media says it's okay it turns off the sharks instincts.
What total stupidity..wow
0% survival skillz
“Where’s the sign??” “Literally everywhere mate”
If a local Aussie tell u to get out the Water u listen not get arsey about it
This guy really chose to dress up like a blue teletubby and splash around on a paddle board in croc infested waters…
C’mon man i would have let the natural selection take its course❤
Live bait !
You told him once. Now its time to grab a lawn chair and about 4 beers and a video camera because this is gonna get some views!
One thing I know as a tourist is stay away from water in Australia, Africa, and Florida. I even stay away from puddles in those places.
Probably a democrat.
Natural selection ready to go.
It’s their water the crock’s just hang out there
Hes got crocs on, listen up bud
"when you get done by it"  😂😭😂
I live in north queensland and often have run ins with crocs while fishing. A boat ramp is where you want to be extra careful.
You're in North Queensland mate, have some common sense. 😂😂😂😂
Sometimes the gene pool is self cleaning
He would not last long out here in Florida. Crocks are found in puddles after a good rain out here. Not to mention the sharks and pythones.😏
Heres your Darwin award
Natural Selection was cheated 2 generations ago! STOP HELPING DUMBS SURVIVE THE GENE POOL! 😂
Australia??.. No thanks.. And I'm a Floridian
He’s literally dressed like those guys you see in movies who get devoured by monsters
Now you see him now you dont. Its natural selection at its finest
These boat ramp Karens need to leave this poor man alone and let natural selection run its course.
He didn’t ask for your opinion😂
But he may be the new crocodile hunter, bro. He knows their language. 😅😂
Bro acting lie hes on a boat when hes on a paddle as well
sometimes, you just got to let natural selection take its course.
Your average liberal 😂
Saltwater crocodile has to be the most terrifying creature alive on Earth
Couldn’t imagine thinking there’s safe water within 500 miles of that country 😂
Should have said, “Hey man, I came and warned you, you don’t want to listen, ok. I’m just filming what happens.” 😂
What a silly man
Too many people think crocs are the same as an alligator and aren't a huge threat. Salt water crocs are man eaters
Perfect example of mind your own business
😂😂😂insane
Dressed up like a croc breath mint
City Boy !
We have an award for this called “The Darwin “ Removing idiots from the gene pool 😊
The blokes a numpty
Nobody realize that a salt water croc, is twice the size of alligators!!, fkn white tail DINOSAURS 🦕 😑 😅
Keep recording,  so we get to see the crocs having lunch!!
You can only lead a horse to water...😢
Let nature take it course.
Seen something similar up near cairns once..
Idiot 🙄
😅idiot on the board
Natural selection
How can a grown adult be so ignorant??? Some people smh
Literally trying to save dudes life and he gets upset 😭😭😭💀
If it doesn't effect your safety shut the fck up and let the man be eaten. That's what's wrong with this country too many wingers. We didn't used to be like this in the old days we used to just quietly say to our mates, fck that blokes crazy then let them be
How many tourists has that croc already eaten?
Firm believer remove the warning labels let the problem sort itself out lol... nom nom nom
"Where's the sign" you could not pay me to do that.
This is the time to stand and watch for the drama. Make sure the battery is fully charged and the video is on.😅
That's what we call... a temporary Australian 😂
The guy is old enough to know better. Why be a Karen about it?
If common sense existed in North Queensland, you wouldn't be there at all😂 Everything there says, " Don't touch me, get off the island!"😂
Blue, smarty, havin a massive, melt down, mate, did you engage your BRAIN today,,
Dinner on a plate mate!!! Bol
Are there crocodiles in the ocean?   Im from the UK, we don't erm... get many crocodiles, i was under the impression they are relatively poor swimmers.  Well, you learn something every day. 😂
“dont waste your time trying to help someone who doesnt want to be helped”
Stop telling the crocodile’s food to get out of the water. Your not doing anyone a favor.
Different flavour for the croc
Let Darwinism do its thing
He must be the only person in the world who never learned from Steve Irwin..
Darwin here….. carry on 😂
I live near a lake in Florida ... We get the same type of tourists here too 😂
Darwin awards mate.
Natural selection in real time I bet he has had all his shots, that’s why his brain cells are fried, see ya see ya wouldn’t want to be ya, ☠️
He's about to be crocodile food
So young dumb and full of come for dinner!
There's just no talking to some people
Not all waters are the same waters you are used to. You'd all be wise to remember that
Tasty idiot it's on the menu today lads❤😂
Did he go to the boat ramp to launch his paddleboard?
The one thing about insulting a man's pride is that you got to bring back around to reduce it.  "Dont blame me when your idiot self gets eaten by crocodiles. But seriously, this is a dangerous area, and I'm only concerned about your safety"
Some people never learn.
Don't warn him, let him be
I like that the crocs are fed by tourists, saves them starving and gives locals something to talk about for a while! 😂
I mean, most aussies don't have much brain power. They live in Australia
If you have an Australian accent I'm going to lessen to you, mate.
As a Floridian, our gators don’t even compare to Aussie crocs.   Those crocodiles are massive and much more aggressive.
Take your chances mate, there's spiders and snakes on the land, there's sharks and crocs in the water, it's only a matter of time!
Let's the croc have the blue man bro
That croc is gonna love his wrapped shawarma roll
Let that croc food swim wherever he wants clearly he’s not going to listen.
Just record it happening stop yapping
Like rocky said if he dies he dies 😂😂
"But don't blame the croc when you get done by it" . This definitely needs to be on every single sign 🪧 where the Crocodiles live , with a photo of the man in this video saying it . 😊
Don’t blame the crocodile lol 😂
Amazing video 😮...what kind of concrete is that?.. Is it poured. Nice texture.
I live in the UK and even I'm aware you don't swim around crocodiles, or where there is the remotest possibility that there might be just one hanging around. For the protection of the future of the human race let him carry on.
Any drill sargents out here
What do you do if a crocodile is chasing you? Trip your mate up😮.
Nah don't even say nothin let darmin win
Two boys standing in the crocodiles both talking to each other about how one is right and the other is wrong. Very much how Donald Trump voters think
Newspaper headline,  Idiot gets attacked by a crocodile.
Just don’t say a word and get the phone camera primed at the ready for the crocs🐊 dinner table
I used to go tubing in Florida waters.. just go fast n you’ll be aight 😂
Hes made of steel I'm nik minit, ouch!
Sounds like Jimmy Laughnin.
Go ahead Mate. I love Australia, they could teach everyone something.
People who rely on a sign to tell them about obvious damgers are funny to watch
Croc Canapè.
Dumb people everywhere
Don't burn yourself to keep someone warm
You honestly have to be mentally handicap in some kind of way to get in crocodile infested waters. That is the strongest level of stupidity you can achieve.
I would have definitely said okay go ahead and kept filming
He is just cleaning up the gene pool
Self sacrificial. It's Qld fckwit ya mad
Yeah don’t blame the crocodile!
This is when I start chumming while giggling
Better off to whisper to him...An eighdeen fooder just sunk below and is coming for ya...paddle fast and get on the dock!  An adeen fooder mate!!
He wants to makes a different video,dinners been served,lol
The locals don’t want to have to call in the fact that theres a paddle board with a bite missing from it.
I just sit back and watch it unfold after telling him one time
Must be USA Expat - same ones who approach bears in Canada with their kids to get photos!
Part2😂
I mean just look at him lol
I woulda left and not felt bad at all after he started arguing
Wow just wow
sure what's the worst that can happen?
Infested or inhabited?
Dope about to be duck soup.
When ALL the locals say that's dumb, then you're being dumb and should probably stop or atleast start telling then that you actually want to die.
Good luck mate
Listen to the locals
Let the man live
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Saltwater crocodiles have been recorded at lengths of 23 feet and he isn’t scared to meet one on his small paddle board.
I live in GA, when we go to south GA to the swamps we know to keep our wits about us and not do dumb stuff like this bc of all the gators in the area. We keep telling Florida to keep them all but that southern hospitality means they want to share some of the love
I’m sorry if you’re in the water and you hear an Australian accent, and that accent isn’t coming from the water.. you should probably dry off
Why do you care tho? As you’re filming hoping for that attack to go viral 😂😂😂
I'm getting out of there as soon as I hear the word crocodile 😂 I'd rather deal with a shark
Pride is the number one killer of men.. no way he turns back now, not after the lady joined in. 😂😂😂 Now he’s got something to prove! 😂
I would walk away after that cuz im not watching someone get fkd up by an alligator or crocodile, bear, lion, or hippo.  😂 Im out!!!
If we just sit back with some popcorn nature will take care of the overpopulation problem 🍿🤷
PLONKER, ALWAYS  ONE.
Norrr
Nature will take care of it. Dont bother these people theyre very busy
"Leave the blue man alone!! He looks delicious"!!.....The Crocs.
You can't reason with a determined idiot 😂
Nah.. Thats just canada's end of life discount version.
In South Carolina it’s ridiculous the amount of people from up north or areas that don’t have alligators who are just totally ignorant.
Why would he blame the croc?
Why are you filming concrete?
Meat popsicle
This guy wanted a tour of a crocs stomach.
"But don't blame the croc when you get done by it", is probably the best advice ever given.
I love Australia. The people are so blunt and to the point. Why u in the water? Because there giant crocodile in the water.
Man warning about Crocs while wearing Crocs. I love it.
I would have just got my phone out and watched.
Atleast hes not American.
Tell him once and go about your business.
NGL thought y'all were in Florida till I heard crocodile
Where are they there, there and there that’s the ones i can see 😂
Yeah like if a ozzy says don’t do something then ya don’t do it.
This is called natural selection sir…
I'm listening and learning
Parking spots opening up soon.
Parking spots opening up soon.
Idiots need to learn life lessons and Iam sorry but if that life lesson ends in death then that's just natural selection then isn't it
Neanderthal 🧠😂
You tried. So just let me be croc food
I wonder how a croc prefers to do a human̈ back shots I guess that's really the only way unless the croc want to be done u can just lay him down and make some shoes or purses lol. Maybe crocs just want love and not just doing people
I wonder how a croc prefers to do a human̈ back shots I guess that's really the only way unless the croc want to be done u can just lay him down and make some shoes or purses lol. Maybe crocs just want love and not just doing people
I have a sister in law from Louisiana, I ask her how do y’all know if there’s an alligator in the water? She replied “ walk up to the edge touch the water and if it feels wet there’s alligators in the water!”
I love Australian voices no matter how mad they are each other they sound like you're just having a normal conversation
If you thought time share reps were bad wait till the croc gets his teeth in to you.
Crocodiles can grow up to 21 feet,  they normally only have 4 do.🤔
Some of us like visiting the crocs
Gotta tell these europeans about florida and Louisiana
You said your piece. The rest is on him.
That’s why I don’t talk to grown people!!!
Ay bro, just because he's a human, doesn't mean natural selection can't apply to him 😂
That Telly tubby has no clue 😅
🐊 Never Play With Your Food! 😂
Awe he wants to feed them
Darwin's theory at work right there.
Was on a cruise in Mexico.  Everystop that I could I got out and bodysurfed. At one particularly beautiful beach, the waves looked pretty decent, so I jumped in for a good while swimming and bodysurfing. It was when I finally got out and was walking up the beach that I noticed the saltwater crocodile warning sign. Haha! I was wondering why so few people were in the water and mainly only on the shallow edge and a big ol' white boy bodysurfing with the crocodiles. Haha!
At this point, if people aren't willing to accept your help or advice, the only way they can learn is the hard way.
Dude literally wants to be eaten alive.
Quit helping the idiotic.  Let Darwin run its course.  🤷🏻‍♂️
Let naturally selection do it's thing haha
Just take the signs down and the problem will sort itself out
You can’t expect his pride not to step in when someone’s pointing a camera at him while speaking in a condescending tone
Keep filming
Go go power rangers
'Go ahead mate, do what you want to do BUT don't blame the crocodile when you get done by it.' 😂😂😂 Wow!! Some people 😂😂😂
This is what we call natural selection
Bro I'm just trying to save you from a Jurassic Park like death I'm not trying to argue with you 🤦🏻‍♂️
Tourists taste like chicken
Crocs dgaf. They actively hunt humans
I bet they will eat Papa Smurf just as fast as they would eat wild animal
Even when Aussies are angry they still sound friendly
Lol if that accent is telling me Im about to be croc food...I'm freakin listening
Pride
As a Floridian a buddy of mine would wrestle wild alligators and i would try and scare tourist buy jumping off the docks next to them. Real florida people and aussies dont carry phones and warn people were to busy living😅
Jes’ tryna get his Chick-fil-A, man.
Darwinism.
Darwinism!!! The cure for all ailments!!!
This guy has more patience than me. I would have told him once and kept walking.
You shouldn’t intervene with natural selection
They way he splashing around aswell makes it worse.. just aswell ring the dinner bell. 😂😂😂
"You do your thing" completely disarmed him
If i ever visited Australia and a local tells me theres Crocs or Sharks or Snakes believe me im listening. If there aint no Aussies in the water theres a good reason for it.
Why couldn’t you just take the American approach? Say nothing and record everything for us to see.
Idiot
Let him make his own experience! He is a grown man 😂😂😂
Love my Aussie's 😂😂❤
Guess his not scared of nuffin
“If he dies, he dies…. Meh”  - Steve yamasaki (I let her be a warrior)
Some people don’t want to be saved, let them get what is coming to them.
Woke mind virus is over there too? Surprisingly he didn't call you a racist. 😆
Apparently it's best to wear red or pink at the beach... If you wear blue you blend in with the water. Same with green.
Let natural selection take care of it.
The algorithm really got with this one.  Fine, I’ll like and comment…but I’m not saying anything bad.
Yeah nah , I ain’t getting in no water in North Queensland and no side quests in any rivers in Queensland full stop.
I woulda started chumming the water
If an Ozzy tells you to get out the water, do as he says.
Sick of livin bro
Stop lying
Why is he even arguing with man who trying to save his life?
Dude I’ve watched Steve Irwin a million times, he’d be fine except for the fact he isn’t wearing his protective khaki shorts.  Really big oversight on his part.
It’s natural selection at work right there!
Some ppl just don’t want to be helped 🤣🤣
Darwin will not be denied.
Boomers have the biggest egos
Please let natural selection do its thing next time. Warn them one time and then go on with your day.
He is apparently applying for The Darwin Award 😂
Dude is worried about the jelly fish, ( rightly so).  But getting stung by somethin takes precedence over getting eaten by somethin. ?????
Oh dear
Spoken like a poet
I wish all the influencers would go oaddle around in croc infested waters. Less brain pollution for kids around the globe.
Let’s the man learn and keep recording
This is like ppl who come to Fla from out of state and just go play in the ocean at night or float around in springs then freak out when a gator comes
Has any one seen my arm ? buddy your in croc water .. don’t tell me what to do 😂😂
Just stop talking and start filming 😂
Maybe with alligators, but not crocs.
Geez... Give the old guy a break... he was just trying to save his family the expenses of a trip to Dignitas in Switzerland.
Darwins theory right there. 😊
:)
Crocs: yeah! Leave him alone. He'll be safe. You should go home.
Love Australians for their reality checks. “Hey mate just sayin you get done by the croc don’t go blaming the croc, you had plenty of warning signs” 😂
Don't blame the crocodile. Hahahha
Thats a woman
Dude has a death wish 😂
Natural selection
Darwinism at work.
Natural selection is a wonderful thing 😂
Those must be the crocs that are bullet proof against the real crocs. Where do I get a pair of those mate
“JUST HAVE SOME COMMON SENSE MATE”
If he gets eaten by a crocodile 🐊 at least your conscience is clear…
I give you the warning after that I walk away. Let nature handle them.
His holiday is on a credit card.
What an idiot 🤦🏾‍♀️🤯🤣
Common sense ain't too common in Scotland either...
Grown man paddling like a child in monster infested waters
Let the crocs have him.
Darwinism
he was just embarrsed
You know you just did a croc out of a meal don’t you?  It was fresh too it was in a blue Cryovac bag.
People never cease to amaze me.
He wants to feed himself to the wildlife  LET HIM....clear the gene pool...fs..
LEAVE THE POOR MAN ALONE, the crocs got families to feed too 🙄
Smooth brain activity
There's one in every village.
Natural selection! Let nature take its course.
What a tool
Mmm, Morons, Tasty.
Not smart on the paddlers side😂
Imbecile alert
Some solid advice 🫡
In North Queensland on a knee board.....😮
I’m sorry but how rude can you be!? Joe Crocker’s DoorDash is gonna be late now.
Chum the water...
It’s called natural selection for a reason, remove all signs I say.  If you’re as dumb as a dung beetle than feed the locals
🤣🤣🤣🤣🐊🐊☠️☠️☠️
Floating around looking like papa Smurf
Bloke's life is being saved and he is indignant
The cyclists of the water, should have just watched the natural selection take place 😂
People are so worried about what someone else is doing. Mind your business and move on 🤷🏻
My Mans just mad cuz once they do eventually get attacked by a croc they blame the croc and act a victim that tourist a clown
Another idiot ringing the Crocodile dinner bell
It’s called natural selection bro….let him be…..
If you're gonna be dumb. You gotta be tough
Imagine getting eaten by a crocodile in that blue suit!!
He the reason crocs get culled
😮😮 those salties get HUGE!! And what in the world is he wearing?? 😂😂
Stubborn man to say the least, respect for blurring his face
THE END TIMES PROPHECIES OF THE BIBLE ARE COMING TRUE NO LIE RESEARCH IT
LISTEN TO ME PPL… IF A AUSSIE OR A PERSON FROM FLORIDA/LOUISIANA TELL U TOO GET OUT OF THE WATER…. FREAKING LISTEN
Personally if I ever went to Australia I wouldn't go near any body of water😅
Climbing up the dock ladder he's bitten by a spider and kicked in the face by a Kangaroo.
Thats not a tourist that’s an Aussie as well, shocker
Splash splash all splashy splash
God has a funny way of weeding out the dumb ones
Keep filming so his family will hear upu tried to warn them plus great video material to share 👍

Organic donation 😂😂😂😂

Trying to save a mans life and he starts arguing with you. Words can’t describe the stupidity of some people.

What a farkin DRONGO!!
This absolute gronk is wearing a stinger suit, so you'd presume he doesn't want to die, but he's splashing around at a boat ramp in NQ??
This person is now missing
Dont ever stop natural selection
He won't be blaming the crocodile because he will no longer have the use of his bodly functions after they meet.
Could you be anymore backward
Crazy people
Smooth brain 🧠🤏
Dude does not want the nightmare of having to see this man eaten
Thank you for showing the sidewalk cuz we really needed to see that
Mind your business smh
He wants to be found by a croc.
Just let Mother Nature take its course
He might be very smart but he is sun 🌞 smart. In his blue swim suit.
I have some saltwater crocs on my property here in Texas, as well as many other crocodilians. Definitely wanna watch yourself with the salties.
Yum yum yummy! Burp.
Why is he arguing? Literally just trying to help him out😂
Silly boy.
Idiot the guy is saving your life
He’s has an attitude cause he doesn’t want to watch a human get eaten
In Florida we tell them to slap  the water repeatedly. That scares them off.
Think the neoprene suit isn't tasty....might get spit out after a couple death rolls..
Nah mate …..i compleetly disbelieve you 😆😆😆😭😭😭😆😆  I bet the poor guy was just begging for a crock to come up then
Always listen to the locals.
Yeah i wouldn't even go in any water in Australia, I'm going nowhere near crocs venomous sea snakes stone fish blue ringed octopuses great whites, that's just a few dangers in lakes and the oceans of oz , I'm not even going to go into  the dangers to what's on the land 🤣🤣
Wheres the sign?   Every 2 feet mate
That accent, telling me there's crocodiles.... Im getting out as fast as possible
I used to play with crocodile all the time in the swamps of S.C. You all like they're scary or something. I'm more afraid of cops than wildlife.
Simon didn't respect Australia, and look what happened to him.
If there is a crocodile in the river I ain't going near it.
Average size 3m
You know its bad when the Australian is warning you lol
Arguing with him makes it worse ! Tell him nicely that it would be safe for him to come on land asap
Bro its Australia common sense ain't so common 😂😅😂
Trying to save the guy and they get upset with you 😂😂😂 people are just gems
He survived the croc encounter, but was later fckd by a Kangaroo
At least he's protecting himself from jellyfish 🪼  😂
Old mate doesn't believe in crocs....🤣🤣🤣🤣 North Queensland has an unsubtle way of reminding you where you are.
Come to feed the pets 😂😂😂😂
He covered himself in blue band aids like they use in kitchens so he won't be eaten by mistake.
Hahahahaja popcorn 🍿  I wont even go near a river mouth with nile crocs, if i can swim in the sea so can they.
mate leave the croc biscuit alone and get your camera ready
Dude let him be we don’t need people Like this on the planet
Why are u saving him
Natural Selection
How could you in your right mind argue with a person that’s trying to help you not get eaten. Oh that must be it. He’s not in his right mind.
When you get done by it 😅
Most passive aggressive life save attempt I’ve ever seen 😂😂❤❤
He probly wants to die. Weird knowing it probly traumatize anyone nearby
He’s about to make the most watched short of all time…he’ll be famous
Trump voter…leavem to it!
you doing the right thing bruh jus put the phone down 😂😂
Louisiana here, you go right ahead, I'll get the bounty on the gator when he's done with you.
Honestly save your breath and let people make their own mistakes
Hey mate! While your paddling around would you mind attaching this big treble hook to the back of your Lilly pad!
Thanks for saving my life is the correct response ❤
If there’s crocs or gators… ever… I’m staying out of the water.
What a f**cking goose!
Perfect example of a liberal
🗣️ I'm blue Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di

Tourist. Please follow our guide lines. Read signs
Darwin Award Winner 😂😂😂
Sharp as a bowling ball
Australian bubbles
You wouldn't catch me in any boat on any piece of water in Australia.
If the water is wet....then there's a croc in it.
He doesn't sound American.  Also most Americans are fans of Crocodile Dundee and know there is Crocs there.
This man is Crazy
I live there for 10 years. You’re an idiot if you are out in the water.
Sorry for all the comments...... this one actually hit my confidence in humanity meter
Remember jumping off a jetty around Townsville 5 mins later they're where tiger sharks in the water watching us
😂😂😂😂😂i love Mother Nature
THAT'S MY FRIEND CHUM......where have you been?????
Warned him now walk away.
Time to chum the water
😂😂😂
Blue man group lost 1 😂
Wheres the sign 😂
"how dare you try and save me"
No no if wants to risk it that’s on him they will recover some part of him if he’s lucky this is natural selection trying to correct the one it missed
Its called natural selection. Lol
Common sense camera shots right there, recording concrete sidewalk👍
100 ways to unalive yourself.
Snack Pack all wrapped in a blue!.Dope!
Stop interfering with natural selection
You have Californians in Australia too huh?
It amazes me when locals care about tourists. Let him learn.
Old people think they know everything. Then, when Grandpa gets taken out, everyone is going to act like it's a tragedy.
My friend was riding a surfboard at an alligator infested canal at night time and no 1 bit him
There's an old joke told in Australia. "How do you get a crocodiles mouth open. Give it a Yank. "
Mate is just paddling away from the wife for the day let him be he fully well knows the consequences with the crocs  😂
Lol I love playing The Australian Horses & Cricket. Best Betting on Earth!
I didn't understand one word
Unreal lol. Is he blind to the signs or just pig ignorant?!
US citizen who's lived all over this beautiful country, I can tell you there are Darwin award candidates everywhere. "Oh look at the cute 800lb bull lion seal, let's get a picture with it." "It's a majestic Buffalo. I'm going to pet it." "Do you see those adorable bear cubs? I don't see their mother. Let's rescue them." "That water looks so refreshing. The alligators won't bother me if I don't bother them. Just a little dip." 🙃🏅 🥴
Yep,,, HOMOSEXUAL.
Let’s all try to allow natural selection to improve our species too.
Darwin award winner! 😂
That guy warned him to get out the water and he can listen so hey s*** happens😂😂😂
Take all the warning labels and handrails off stuff then we can get back to normal societies
It’s almost as if the locals know the local wildlife😂 idk why people even try to argue
Thinning out the gene pool by himself! How thoughtful. 😂😂
Signs should read, " *DARWIN AWARDS GIVEN GRATUITOUSLY* ."
As a Floridian; we completely understand the frustration..
What an absolute dim sim. Ya don't need a sign when your in north Queensland ya dim sim..
Oh no…. Did I hear an American accent??  Sorry yall.
This is when you jus sit back and watch. Safety warnings can only save people smart enough to read them. Beyond that, it's in the universe's best interest that papa smurf gets nommed by a croc. 🐊
This dudes from Florida he dgaf.
He sounds like an Aussie !?
The question is why do u care so much? How does that affect u in any way?! I hate nosey people that don’t have lives. I would have sat there and chummed the water to attract the crocs and watch the show 🍿
Australia is wild 😂😂 Im from Florida so we are kindred spirits, we got crocs and alligators and people like that dude
He's "fully aware" of where he's is, "yeah righto"
You should always take local advice from people with that accent….🤠that guy in the stinger suit has got to be some soft white banker from Sydney. 😂😂😂
Boomers…..mmmm 🐊 extra soft😋
dude knows he's in Australia and is probably aware he's gonna get eaten before his vacation is over anyway!... he probably survived this only to get drowned by a kangaroo later that day in a kiddy pool!
The facts he’s wearing crocs telling the old man about the crocs lol
Dude, I would have stopped fishing and watched the show. Thats crazy
Don't Feed the Animals mate
Wouldn't be the crocs fault at all. Darwin award coming up
Crocs don't discriminate 😂
You should not interfere with natural selection😮😂😂
Bye ✌️
If he wants to feed the wildlife just leave him alone don't be such a Karen 😂
Natural selection
Where's the sign 😂
Show a part two please 🙏
Is this like florida?
lol 😂
Well, when in Darwin...
Natural selection. The crocs have to feed.
Snack pack
Where's the sign lol. People have no clue about the dangers they put themselves in. He didn't even know crocs live there lol.
Looks like yorkeys right at the mouth of croc infested creek
lol free food for the crocs. This is hilarious.
Crocs love Tourists the thicker the better!😂
They dont hang around for fish, there hang around to catch a tourist who thinks there no everything 😂
They wait for fish and idiots!
What an idiot!
This is the sought of idiot know-all who once on the operating table would tell the surgeon what to do.
This is the sought of idiot know-all who once on the operating table would tell the surgeon what to do.
Been to queensland a couple years ago. The first thing a local told me:“ if you see a sign that a croc was spotted recently in this area, its not a gimmick or a tourist trap. Its for real and the only thing a tourist get trappes in its in a crocs mouth“.  Next day we saw a giant saltie about 20 meters away from us (we stayed on the track and followed his advice)  So believe the locals if you dont wanna win a darwin award
Leave him alone, can't you see that he wants to feed the crocodiles 😂😂😂😂
No self respecting crocodile would eat an old smurf. 😂😅🤣
The toddler man is worried about sun cancer, though… look at him! Paddling about like a lunatic in temps in the high 30s, protecting himself from the sun but not the crocs. What an idiot.
Let him go film for views it’s normal in this day and age
Idiot! 🤦🏻
Crocs love tourists especially 😂😂😂
Nth Qld Crocs favourite food is tourists. Lmafo 😊
Chum: Humans think they own everything!  Anchor: Probably American! If you know you know 😂🤣
Natural selection is strong with this one 👍🏽
