No
Beautiful tribute
She’s her grandmother grandchild. What a beautiful rendition of her grandmother success.
Taylor soes 100% better
This brings me chills
this alone makes me feel proud and respectful of things in life. there was no fancy cars big houses or millions of dollars. we had food a roof family job and bills were paid
Very pretty voice keep up the good worl
None better than Emmy Rose Russell ❤❗️
Thanks Emmy Russell that's all I can say you made your Memaw proud for sure she's smiling from the heavens down on you  You sure have made that song yours
Not something I'd listen to. The original can't be bested.
Made me cry instantly 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
Why am I crying?
It’s kinda boring but I guess that’s the way this generation sings nowadays
I wish she would have said “proud to be coal miners great granddaughter” ❤
Who cutting onions?
You know when someone just has that magic.....Emmy is going to go very far...
This is the song the rich folk listen to in 2025 while they move to some 2.5 million dollar mountain home thinking they are “country”  🤣
That was my favorite season so far
Wow beautiful singing with matching beauty❤️💯❗️
Nope, she's not Loretta
On the surface it seems like a gimicky stunt to have her sing lorettas song...then... you realize your witnessing something magical
Renewal of American Greatness right here. ❤❤❤
Anyone else think she looks like a different person from the audition?
She ruined it
She should have won
You can tell shes kin.That Loretta Lynn look. Great people and my neighbors.  Tennessee here ❤
I grew up listening to Loretta, conway, and all the greats. I dont watch american idol, nor do i listen to much of today's so-called country music. My wife said, you got to listen to Lorettas' granddaughter sing  Cole minors' daughter,   Loretta sung it like nobody ever can or will, but this girl just brung it to life.  What a stunning performance, wow
Singing her family's story!  Absolutely beautiful!
This was incredible. Tears and chills. I love this. And, only Loretta's kin could pull this off. Amazing!!
This needs to be recorded. So beautiful
❤.
She's definitely a phenomenal inspiration ❤
Beautiful ❤
Wow🎵🎼🎶
Beautiful rendition
It's just the circle of life that she captured her grandmother's spirit during her performance. She truly soared to amazing heights with the lyrics.
She shared in an interview that the number one thing she learned from her grandma was to love God and I’ll forever remember that
She can't sang that song I'm sorry
Her voice is way too weak.
I know she was upset they had her sing her Memaws song, but I still heard Emma in that song and gave me goosebumps. ❤😊
Sorry, but this is awful!  You told her she could sing??
Effin epic her grandmother would have been proud she sang that song and did it justice
I cried like a baby!!!  This is Loretta Lynn on steroids!!!  Omg I love her!!!!!!!  Bless her Lord!!!!!
Loretta Lynn’s granddaughter says ‘American Idol’ judges made her ‘so mad’ by asking her to do grandma's song
Coal miners daughter
Yeah, let’s sing a Loretta Lynn song with a Billie Eilish sound and ruin it. No thanks.
This is one of the Idol moments I wish I could've been in the room for. It brings me to tears each time. This carried something special.
9 Months later and it still makes me tear up
That was a tear jerker but so lovely!  Her MeeMaw would be so proud in her heavenly abode!  💖💖
And that’s why it’s called American Idol
Rally great
So damn good!
She's so pretty as,well.
you can bet your butt her grandmother is looking down and is beyond proud of her
Beautiful❤
Their styles and voices are different, but there is definitely a distinct wispy hint of meemaw in Emmy’ s performance. 👍
No autotune, no syntonization, just lady and her piano. This is pure artistry.
This girl is just the real thing.  I love to hear her sing.  Never forget Loretta Lynn and how amazing her voice was and this is one of my favorite songs by her.  Those good old days with specials and these amazing people with their outstanding songs and voices.
I cried. Beautiful❤❤❤
You can hear her grandma’s voice in her. Beautiful.
She honors her grandmother very well!😊
You sounded great
Incredible and moving performace!
She has the same rasp as her Grammy
No offense but why did she do that to her grannies so g
This was beautiful ❤
This sounds like perfect life. So much love <3
YOU ARE A FORCE!! NEVER BACK DOWN
Love ya Emmy ! Keep it up!!!
I reckon they fixed it for her to win in her first audition
Stunning. Beautiful.
No comment.
That was absolutely breathtaking beautiful ❤& the audience who got to witness this moment was also blown away ❤
She definitely looks like she is related to Loretta.
I've never heard the original or the story until I saw this... AMAZING. I truly hope Emmy becomes a great recognised musician, she has an amazing voice!.
Made me cry. Moving and beautiful
Her grandmother would be so proud.
WOOOOOOOOAH
Man. When America was country music. AM radio on the way to school
Why she kept saying cold miner I can't figure out.
She is truly Loretta’s granddaughter! With the same fantastic voice and talent!
Well, singing talent isn't hereditary. Ouch.
Wow, she did a beautiful job.
Exquisite performance, your MeMaw would be proud
song is wack
Her voice is beautiful. She is wonderful inside and out. She looked better in sweats not this hubbub fancy nonsense they’re throwing on her.
I grew up watching and listening to her grandmother Loretta, it felt like she was a part of our family cus we all liked her so much and she brought her story to life so beautifully that anyone who loved her  music felt like they were family.
😢
❤ just ❤
Good Lord!! She sound exactly like her grand mamma!! ❤
This floored me.
You made gramma proud Emmy, absolutely beautiful
Coal minor’s daughter
Seriously, she's on American Idol?  She should be headlining concerts.
That gave me chills
If you’ve never seen the movie, you’re truly missing out on an excellent classic. This is a beautifully done rendition as well
Can't believe how much she sounds like Loretta... proof that her granddaughter has definitely definitely got a bright future ahead
I personally don’t like how she changed it, but that’s just my opinion 🤷‍♀️. I still think she’s a great singer, a sweet girl, & has great potential
Um, she's the granddaughter of a famous Country singer. So, talent runs in the family, obviously, so it shouldn't surprise you. My grandmother, my mom, myself, and both of my brothers can sing, and my daughter and I play the piano, and my biological father played the electric guitar. Music runs in the family, can't you tell? Usually one of the famous singers in Hollywood has a child who's just as talented. Kenny G, the soulful sax player, his son plays sax as well, and he's damn good. I don't think it's rare for a famous musician's child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild, niece or nephew to possess the same talent. I can't stand Country music, but this young lady has a BEAUTIFUL voice. Very beautiful physically as well. She poured her soul into that song, and you can bet your cowboy boot that her grandma is smiling down on her, saying, "You go, girl..."
I listen to the original first and now i know people in this times cant really sing Destroys the good clear song with this kind of new boring singing
Grandmother sang it better
She should of❤ won America idol
ao beautiful i cried ❤❤❤
Angelic voice! So blessed
Shes a mix of her gma and allison krouss
Her bloodline is country music royalty. No one, and I mean no one, casts a bigger shadow than Loretta.
why she make her voice squeaky maybe cus she’s young
And she didn't win the season why?
She has pleasant voice but she's an average singer at best in my opinion.
Shine bright little one and let no one take it from you❤
That Was absolutely brilliant
American Idol might not bring the same hype it used to with artist songs going mainstream but I definitely hope she carves her own fanbase and see her pop up again🔥
CHILLS!   STUNNING!
Very similar sound to Dixie chicks!!
You are going to be missed Loretta Lynn. Our queen of country music
Mom must be absolutely overwhelmed with emotions here man
Lovely, just lovely. Its a shame what the elite have done to this country. LETS GET IT BACK. FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.
like her grandma 👏👏
Goosebumps!   God bless    /A truckdrivers son
oh damn that was not good..the girl can sing but she let go of that song...
she did good at choking down that emotion i could see the urge to cry in her throat the entire song. it was in mine too
Won’t be much longer until her soul is sold for money
Nils Overpass
Singing through emotion is tough and she did it
beautiful
Idk why her voice reminds me of janet devlin from her audition days.. 😭
Would she really have gotten through if she wasn’t Lauretta Lynn’s granddaughter though?
Absolutely hate nepatism
Eliane Loop
Beautiful
Miss Loretta...still here
I need a whole album of her doing Loretta’s songs, this was so beautiful!
CHILLS
Yessss!!!
It’s so beautiful to see generational blessings ❤
Wow! What a voice
😢❤ she sounds great!

Emma is something very special, an angel. God sent to us 😂❤
Blick Fork
Wow she really did honor her family. By stepping up and doing this. ❤
You can def tell which audience member is Loretta’s daughter …..she looks just like Loretta & crystal
I still once in awhile come listen to this masterpiece what a absolutely beautiful version of this song and that voice is just as beautiful
❤
I don't know about anyone else, but I felt the words and the way she sang her grandmother's song, in my soul. Loretta, I know that you are proud of your granddaughter!
Rest in peace...
Singing is rooted in her blood and soul❤
She has so much heart. She pours it all into it
Not impressive. She should have been more genuine, this voice sounds pretentious.
After audition "you're a great song writer. You need to do your own thing. Then they have her do her grandmother's song. And not one of her own. America idol is so full of it.
Beautiful voice
My grandpa and grandma were gone by the time I was 17.  24 years has passed but nothing will ever erase the indelible mark they left on me.  Emmy’s performance shows not only her exceptional talent but the bond and mark her grandmother left on her and how that will always lead her throughout the rest of her life.  Her grandma is looking at her with pride…
Really good………🤘🏻👌🏻
Shes such a beautiful person
Loretta is crying happy tears honey. You made her so happy.
Never gets old…still my favorite of this season❤️
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Stay Humble / It's Never Luck !!!!!!! Amen
Brings tears to my eyes, Loretta and Patsy played throughout my home daily.. my grandmother loved their talent dearly ❤
Emmy has this ethereal voice that can’t be taught.
You did it girl. You projected her intovthe minds and hearts of bot only future yenerations but teminder the oast or the hardship an passion. Love you and you look kike your meemaw
I dont remember that song ever making me cry before 😢
Songs like this bring tears to my eyes,nothing can bring back the good ole days except memories, gracefully done Emmy gracefully done ❤❤
Love this song
Send her to the top Simon because this is the granddaughter of the Great Loretta Lynn Ballad of a Coal Miner's Daughter is her story.
She is amazing ❤
This is legendary.  Woman sings about 4th generation ancestors.    Epic.  Think what it means to be a coal miner's daughter in America.   It means you are the descendant of the very people that built America.
I get chills every time I watch it. You can feel Loretta standing by her side singing it with her. Watching the videos of her with Loretta when touring you can she see true star power and talent in her Grand Daughter and wanted to help her flourish.
she has crystals in her voice
She made this song her own and yes she goes sound like Loretta a lot
Idol had a moment there
She should be singing, "I was born a coal miner's Great-Granddaughter"
Oh my, that was beautiful
She has a wonderful voice!  So unique.  I wish the best for her.
The impactfullness of her singing this is such a cheat code over any other contestant. Its not even fair dude.
Ironically I believe that this is the song that propelled her out of Loretta's shadow. She is a star in her own right. Loretta's would be so proud to see her now.
No word's
This was absolutely beautiful. I'm not American, not a country music fan, and not at all familiar with her grandmother's work... but I deeply connected to this. I'm sure her grandmother would be proud.
Angelic
Loveee her!!! ❤❤❤
Judges had good early advise....... put away Loretta's shoes and put on your own.
Your grandma smiling right watching you
Very emotionally moving performance. Incredibly impressive. 😎👍
Her memaw is proud.
Wow
This family has deep roots in coal country and there’s allot of her ancestors looking at this girl with pride from heaven!
If you really listen to her you can hear a bit of Loretta Lynn in her voice
Its really hard to know.  The heart of the women back then.  They held a deeper voice ❤
Great job Emmy! You have your own sound and voice!
Omg that was absolutely freaking beautiful
I never thought I would be so fascinated and enchanted by a person I've never met, but man, she truly is the woman of my dreams.  Amazing performance, amazing woman, amazing song.
With some work on her articulation, this would be perfection. I'm confident it's purposeful, it sounds like a "learned" accent instead of an inherited one.   Don't stop singing. Rememer that the lyrics have just as much if not more of a contribution to the overall beauty of a song than even your own delivery does.  This is solely meant to be constructive criticism. She has a gift, but she's taking away from it by participating in a sort of "trend" of younger singers intentionally articulating incorrectly for a particular "sound."
Way to make it your own, very very nice.
Kaci musgraves sound alike
Singing her family's history. Incredible legacy to have!!
Chills and tears!!!! Love it!
Beautiful.  😭🥲
Okay am I missing something here? I feel like this girl is hyped up just because her grandma. She can carry a tune but her singing is subpar to say the least.
i don't consider myself a huge fan of her and i believe she was fairly critiqued for her vocals, but i think this performance alone proved that she's an artist worth paying attention to. the arrangement was beautiful, and turning the song into something more emotional, ballad and indie and that felt more authentically her was a bigger accomplishment than most other contestants had this entire season.
Beautiful she made her own 🩷😍
I thought she’d be a lot better
Isn’t she Loretta Lynn’s granddaughter ?  Man she has song writing from the heart in her genetics !
I got goosebumps watching this. I look forward to hearing much more from Miss Emmy Russell!! I think your name will go down in history, just like your grandmother.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
just can't get enough of this it's simply amazing her voice is something so beautiful I sincerely hope she makes music until she wants to stop doing so. She has a huge fan here for life!!!!!!!!!
I sincerely hope you go far. You are extremely talented and you have humility. Just keep being yourself and true to yourself.
Why do all these voices from the last 10 years or so sound like underdeveloped breathy baby voices?
That young lady is amazing, Coal miner's daughter has always been one of my favorites. Now Im able to enjoy two very different versions of the same song.. I wish her all the best..
Absolutely incredible, wheww! 💕💗💛🥺🔥🔥
Who else is crying here?! WoW
So beautiful, made me cry something awful.
great tribute to her Amazing 1 Grandmother Loretta Lynn   i grew up loving listening to Loretta Lynn  and her sister sing 🙏🏼💜  listening to Loretta Lynn a few minutes ago  over & over again to 1970s old live shows  on youtube - wow ! very very powerful voice she had - gave me goose bumps & tears in my eyes 💜
This brought tears to my eyes it takes me back to every memory I've ever had with my mom she always sang Loretta's songs to me as a kid rip Loretta rip momma
#Bravo #EmmyRussell #Emmy #Russell #Voice #Vocals #Singer #Music #Loyal #Fan #HollywoodRockStars #Entertainment
Oh, I like her voice!
Please record this version for us to buy
You go girl you are fantastic and humble you will have millions of fans because your an original like Loretta is. Stay true to yourself and the rest will fall into place!
Yeah the chords don’t work with this song. This was awful melodically and in every other way.
Cross between her grandmother and Dolly Parton!
great . . . now i'm crying . . .
What season and episode was this from??
Beautiful voice what a honor to listen to her
So good, wooowww!!
Trying to step out of the shadow of her grandmother, she is staying in the shadow of a plethora of modern pop artists.
I ❤ your new song Redemption 😊 Congratulations 🎉🎊 Your truly amazing! I’m so proud of you! And you got 1 million views on your u tube vedio Coal Miners Daughter Amazing You deserve a 🏆🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇And Lots More!  Be proud you are very special 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You have a cute voice but you're to young and from the new generation to sound like her you need to have someone help you sing songs for your age group I'm not putting you down you need a coach to help you sweetie to sing for your age group that's all
Her voice is like on the hill songs. Very nice vibe to hear.
I just don't think her voice is anything special. I hate that I think that, I would love for her to be great.
She lost me and all I could imagine was Loretta Lynn singing, now I’m on Apple TV looking for the movie
Boring 😴
It would sound great if it was written as another song, but to me if you're going to honor a specific song, it should at least have more of the same chord progression.  It's entirely  unrecognizable as the same song.
Sorry but she can't sing lorrettas song.  She is terrible
Emmy Russel's raw powerful talent will carry her through even without American Idol. That was a powerfully touching rendition of her grandma's song . She touched people and honored her grandma's memory. We will hear more from her . Phenomenal
One of the best rendition. Of coal miners daughter. I loved it alot.❤❤❤
Wtf is this indie crap
Beautiful version,loved the original,and movie...her Gramma would be proud.. Emmy always pulls my 💜😢😊
Goosebumps ❤
Sometimes YouTube does phenomenal with recommendations. Beautiful.
Did not like it at all. No heart just soft spoken
It wasn’t the song. This time it was all fan based. That big tall over grown guy chose 2 bad songs. Jack gets on my nerves. Abi Carter  has her own voice and she truly deserved to go forward. All the guys should have been dumped last week. Abi, Emmy, the other tall adopted girl should have gone through. The short Hawaiian looking girl also. There are to many Adels out there already. It’s time for unique artist to come into the picture.
Should have picked a different Disney song 😢
WoW. Just WOW!
Sorry but she murdered her grandmamas song
Not a fan of Sorry don’t like this version at all
Like grandmother like grand daughter Loretta is so proud of you 😢😢❤❤❤
WOW WOW WOW... AWESOME!!!!!
She does and amazing job telling this song in her own way the lynn are truly gifted
Emmy, On A Scale Of 1 to 10, you are an 11  🎉
Nepotism?
Emmy you deserved to continue on American Idol.  I voted for you and believe you are the most talented contestant they had.  Unfortunately the American public fell for one contestant who should have been eliminated instead of you.  Keep on singing.  You have a God given talent not only in singing but your song writing.
My favorite
Probably the best performance of the show. Hopefully someone records her cover. It would take off.
She's pure talent. Unlike trailor swift!
Can wait for her record to come out friday!!
She sings great! Very unique I wish the judges would emphasize her awesome sound and quit talking about nerves she’s wonderful
Emmy Russell should have been in top 3. Lot of people thinks she shouldn't be on American Idol because of he  music family background. I come from a very long line of Politicians dating back to the 3rd Governor of New Jersey does that mean I have to go into politics to,of course not. It's like being in the music business some people have it and some dont
She really makes her Grand ma proud! GRAB that American idol crown.. AMERICA  vote for her❤️❤️❤️ watching all these in Manila Philippines 🇵🇭
Emmy Russell does not need to compete on American Idol.  She has a beautiful voice, already has contacts to help her promote her talent and has a family member that was and still is celebrated as a legend and one of the best.  It gives her an edge and I think that's unfair to the other contestants.
Loved it
NEPO Gran-BABY?
So beautiful love you hope you win
Wow!!!!! Once again Amy, you are So So Impressive and your story as well as your Grand-Mother’s Story, it really touches me So So A lot!!! Wow!!! Makes Me Cry… So Good!!!!!! You are already a Winner to me!!!!! XOOXOX!!!!! Have A Very Nice Success and Just Take This One Day At A Time My Very Dear Friend because you trully deserve all of this Recognition!!!!!!!!!!! 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😮😢🎉🎉😂❤❤
Just came from her audition video and I'm about to cry,  so sweet. Keep it going Emmy!
GREAT JOB!!!  💐🌹🌷🌺🌸🌹
❤
Shame we will never get to hear them do a duet of this song. That was amazing. ❤❤
I cried just clicking on this video. My daddy wasn't a coal miner... My great grandaddy was. He was determined to get his family out of the mines, come hell or high water. And he did, and here we are... 100 years later and I'm a college educated, small business owning, still country as hell, strong as hell, but urban adaptive as well ❤️  RIP Colonel Sherman Gibson ❤️ 1891-1968
Poor emma she just doesn't have that coal miner's feel she doesn't know what some of the things in the song meant
Tears me up Every Time 🌹♥️🥰🎶 I’ve never witnessed anything more Beautiful to me 🙏🏼🌹♥️🎼🎭😇 Thank You Emmy Russell 🙏🏼🌹🌹
why did she have to trigger our tearducts like that-🥲that was so beautiful.
Tough singing a classic Country tune popularized by a beloved standardbarer, Loretta Lynn, HER grandmother! Anything for one more moment with my grandma! "Performed beautifully her way." Country's all we have left. Entertainment's been destroyed by 'no talent DEI trash.' Why classic bands still tour make most money! Don't let DEI destroy Country, too!
You’re so special . Loved this performance .⭐️⭐️
She has this aura that I can’t explain. I think she’s meant for this! ❤
Honestly she's voice just a regular voice but the performance its awesome and make me in tears ...
She made me understand the song in a different way with a different emotion. Respect to the hard working blue collar fathers providing for their families.
It’s really hard to sing and cry at the same time. You could tell she was thinking about her grandmother while she was singing that song. Obviously, but you could literally See and Hear the memories going through her while she fought (very successfully and gracefully) to keep her composure.  Well done, young lady.  I’m sure Your Grandmother is watching down on you, and is SO proud of you!
Thumbs Up 👍 😊 ❤
Top 10 nepo baby
Emmy has a beautiful voice just like her grandmother Lorrate Lynn !!!!❤🌹💋
Emmy you should write a song called Cold miners Great-granddaughter with inspiration from Cold miners Daughter
Someone needs to sign her and this be her first single.  Imagine hearing this on radio while you're driving and the emotions you'd feel.
I was 😭 crying hearing you sing this beautiful song your a star rising,angelic beautiful voice ❤
I know her grandma is sitting so proud right now.
This has got to join the list as one of the best performances on American Idol ever....lightning struck this night as she made a signature song of a singing legend into a ballad of respect - respect of the hard times told in the lyrics, respect to the actual region of these people, and the reality of the question "will we today live up to the perseverance, sacrifice and love of family depicted in this song?". Oh yea, and its about her very own family.....wow.
Goosebumps
I personally don’t understand why people don’t think she’s talented. She has a unique voice and writes her own songs. I love it that she’s carrying on her grandmother’s legacy, but still trying to be her own artist.
Loretta was there on that stage standing behind her singing ever word with her ..and sayin you show them who you are and where you come from ..
soon 900,000 views
Emmy is unique she’s the winner in my book! One classy young lady could listen to her for a long stretch.  I can understand her words easily, some of the others I can barely understand the words  annunciation is key
I know God is real when I hear her sing. Amazing 😮.
❤
Have damn mercy a brand new amazing old story in the same family just wow 🎉
It's totally unbelievable  that someone as lousy as Emmy could ever get this far. RIGGED.
She should have done a Kylie Minogue dance song.
This was one of my favorite performances ever. It was so beautiful, and the story behind it is part of what makes music so impactful. Legit had me in tears. This is what it’s all about 💙
What a beautiful tribute.
That's her Grand daughter
She reminds me of blackbirde
Terrible. She's not top 10 for me.
I really like her no matter who is she raleted to well done and great cover
Why is it allowed for relatives of rich and famous singers to be contestants on shows such as American Idol or The Voice? They already have an advantage of having the money and exposure from their own relatives for easy stardom. These greedy people are actually taking the spot away from a regular Jane or Joe who are truly great singers, but don't have the money or access to easy exposure. This should not be allowed because they are basically being pushed aside and robbed from an opportunity of a lifetime that will otherwise never happen.
I jus like her so much. Real and precious.
Loved Loretta...wish her granddaughter Emmy many blessings
Beautifully done.
Loretta would be proud of the legacy that follows her today
Beautiful!
Honestly, LORETTA was a true talent and fantastic! Emmy, she is no where near. She’s not “American Idol” quality. It’s true! The only true talent this season is McKenna.
Total BC USING HER GRANDMAS NAME FOR VOTES..SO UNFAIR
This was a performance we would of expected from her 10 years from now when she makes an appearance in AI season finale.
Absolutely beautiful voice ! ❤
I just love this. She is 100% herself. But her grandma would be so proud. ❤
🥲
I think it's wrong that she is allowed to perform on American Idol. I thought they helped young talented people who otherwise wouldn't have a chance of sharing their talent with the world. Emmy had a chance! Her grandmother was Loretta Lynn and they used to perform together. How is this fair to all of the other contestants who don't have famous grandmothers and never got to go up on stage and perform when they were younger? Kids who have pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps shouldn't have to compete with someone who has been coddled.
damn.. this is no competition. this is the making of a rising legend.
Nepo baby with an average voice
For me,this was without a doubt, her best performance so far. I hope she will decide to sing her song "unwinding the strings"..I just watched an old YouTube video of her singing it to her grandmother Loretta Lynn....she wrote it for her and it's beautiful
Yepper she’s got it. Good for her.
What a beautiful way to honor her grandmother. She must be looking down so proud.
She has such a weak voice
Singing a song written by your grandmother that she wrote to honor your great grandfather…and knocking it out of the park
She did a great job, only wishing she would have sang her grandmothers version of the song.  But I guess you have to “make it your own” to stand out. 😢 Unfortunate.
Freeze the video at 1:54, lol. What's going on here?
She’s pure and professional. It is time that American Idol will be represented by artist and not a singer. She already captures The Philippines hearts. Come here please ❤
Awesome she’s her grandma ❤❤
Dog Bless ❤
While this was very emotional and touching it wasn't a good song for her. I kinda feel sorry for her because it was an option. I think she felt obligated to sing it. She's not her great grandmother. her voice isn't like hers. And the song doesn't suit her well. She's also not that great at singing nor playing the piano. But she is where she's at because of her heritage and maybe she can do something with that to make a living. But she's not top tier talent in this season's choices. Abi ,Will and Jack are my final 3.
Amazing performance. Whomever styled her for this did her a great disservice. The makeup technique ages her 20 years. Thank God she is otherwise so exceptional.
I love  her  authenticity! Very refreshing to see. She is definitely not your typical contestant. She has something that I can't quite find the words to describe, it's a feeling, intuitive, and real, imaginative, and takes you to that special place in your minds eye.  Thank you Emmy
The talent this season is INSANE!!!!!
That was beautiful 🥹
I can’t stand cursive singing in general, but add pitchiness and a forced baby voice, and it’s just too much. Not sure why she even made it to Hollywood.
1:53 same.
There is a reason they saved it as the last performance for the episode
Very nice!
Can't believe i cry again
Crying…wow…❤
First time I'm fully hearing this song, I'm not a big fan of country, but the way she said Water gave me shivers
1:54 says it all
Emmy you Grandma's fit you fine
Great job
That was amazing! Best performance & what a great honor to her grandmother!
She's my favorite starting from her BEAUTIFUL THINGS performance. Gonna support her 'til the end. We love you Emmy Russell!🥺🥺🥺
Her grandma would be so proud
I am blown away with her heart and talent
Goosebumps ❤
Beautiful
Good voice but wreaked the song
Probably one of the best idol performances ever and I’ve seen them all
I guess we're in our nepo-baby era.
Uh yeah I don't get the arrangement. What a shame. Who took this legendary song and twisted it into a pop wanna be.
She did her Grandma proud! She's smiling and so proud ❤😂❤❤❤❤❤
This is EVERYTHING!!! So many people, even today, can relate to the story in this song!
She made me cry amazing
That made me emotional, Thanks for that ride Emmy.
More energy needed in this song. The piano overshadows voice
The Extra is not needed the Song is perfect as is
Loretta would be so damned proud of Emmy right now. Emmy has performed such a beautiful rendition of her Meemaw’s song, brought into the modern with her own flair, and has completely made it her own. ❤
I tear up every time I hear her deliver this song. I noticed that   a major part of the contestants on this show are worried about their vocal techniques. A true singer has to show the emotion involved in what they deliver, and Emmy shows true passion. Her delivery comes from her heart.❤
❤ Beautiful ❤
I guess you are only as good as your last song?  But this is truly timeless. What great rendition of a true American story!  Emmy is truly a gem.
Whoa, I never thought I would hear this song sung this way! Incredible!
When she went into that “whoaaaa” near the end I was melting like butter in a skillet.
My wife and I have been watching since David Cook brought home the crown.  This might just be the best performance we have ever seen.
Beautiful rendition
Awesome job Emmy I know your mammaw would be proud and is smiling up in heaven
Beautiful.  Such grace like her Grandmother❤
And her grandmother smiled down at her from heaven.
Memaw is so happy!
Great Job Baby Girl
No.......
Emmy can win this event. Her voice has pierced my heart. I've never voted before but I will vote for Emmy
❤❤❤
Great!!! Just great!! Its, noon and im stuck in traffic doing deliveries and im balling my eyes out 😭😭😭 absolutely amazing ❤️❤️❤️
It’s kinda hard for me to put this into words but I hope everyone understands what I’m trying to say.. If you listen you can hear a little Loretta in her voice but she also puts a little of her own twist on the song, like some soft subtle tones with some high notes in there. It was beautifully sung. She definitely has a beautiful voice and I think if singing is her career path I believe she’ll do well and probably go a long way…. Good luck in whatever you do…
great voice here thats missing in Country Music... hope she wins.
I'm just mad that she waited so long to come out
I'm proud to be every mother's wayward son.
Wow this was AMAZING! 👏
I bursted into peaces. I heard this song first time in my life
Never knew goosebumps could last 20 secs. 🙌
Stunning.
This is the real star who can sing and telling the story of the song.. Emmy Russle for the win ❤
Beautiful voice her grandmother is rejoicing in heaven
I just love her!!
Im in love with her gorgeous  lady great voice
Showstopper
This was such a stand out moment we all been waiting for. When I heard she choose this song I was like no , you’ll get compared to your Grandmother but then she sand it so different and beautiful like an angel. Incredible
I didn’t like it she should’ve stuck to the original way it was performed not on piano
THIS. WAS. EVERYTHING. A moment in time i will not forget 🙏❤
She didn’t change her piano note chords as she should have done with her voice notes. Very odd to listen to. Not a fan of that version.
Lovely ❤ so talented
The open pause for “daughter” that is now a greatgranddaughter and daughter gone
Like if you cried.
Breathtaking!!!!    Her MeMaw was the greatest and her Mama and Aunts are very good but this precious young lady is AMAZING!!!!
It isn't just a shadow that you emmy russel 24yrs old that you're walking alongside, but a true gift of tradition & legacy, 2 very beautiful gifts meant to be embraced and not feared. I lost my Grammy nearly 30 yrs ago, she couldn't carry a tune, yet she made up for it with unconditional love for her family. Something i've passed along as well as my love of music from my dad & crocheting from my grammy. As a person who lets stage fright get the best of me, its kind of diffcult to practice my own advice, yet i'm willing to give it. Never be afraid to share ones god given talent with the world & to whomever is willing to listen. You emmy russel did wonderful with your memaw's song, she would be & is proud of you! Your duet with jack was stunning! Wishing you all the best present & future
It was ok but original is better
My goodness!
Loretta Lynn is my hero. She did this so beautifully
Her mom looked soooo proud
She is not her Grandmother 😢
Great job to her family
Hey, keep it up no matter what.   Whatever they say will only stronger, better, and more capable in being who you are.  Love your voice. Keep performing at that level and never forget who you are and  anything you've been through, let it make you the best at what you want to be
The Contest is between her and Jack. She has best story telling voice.
She did Lorretta proud.  But she did it her way.  Great Job Emmy
Perfection. She is by far my favorite contestant this season ❤
Wow, what a voice!
Terrible
Hello, May I share the most important news you will ever hear in your entire life? God the Father sent His holy Son Jesus Christ(Y'shua Ha' Mashiach) from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin. He grew up and died on the cross for our sins.  He was put into a tomb for 3 days, and then Abba Father raised Jesus to life and He appeared to people and went back to Heaven.  We must all sincerely receive Jesus to be a true child of God.  It says in John 1:12 "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." Will you genuinely believe on Christ Jesus and truly receive Him today, before it is too late?
Honestly if you love country music and know about Loretta Lynn and seeing how Emmy is so family oriented and not flashy and stays to her self.. I honestly love it. Really enjoy her
This performance made me cry a little. Just beautiful.
Emmy Russell!!   A MAZE ING!  Another ICON in the making and we are all able to be watching it unfold!
I’m 22 and grew up listening to older country. My grandma loved Loretta Lynn and patsy cline. I’m literally crying right now.
Superb!!!!!!
I swear for a second, I could hear Loretta Lynn's voice.  She's definitely watching her granddaughter from above.
A true Angel.
SHE BRINGS LORETTAS MUSIC ALIVE AGAIN ❤❤❤❤❤❤ I JUST LOVE HER BUT I LOVE HER MUSIC AS WELL SHE'S GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL
She could do Jewel songs really well!
I would love to hear her sing it as it was originally recorded
SHE ALWAYS SAYS "THANK YOU" THAT MEANS ALOT....
ALL I CAN SAY IS "WOW" - EMMY DESERVES TO WIN, SHE HAS MY VOTE, CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR HER ON SUNDAY...
Emmy russell your already an artist. You will go far and not because of your family. You take songs and make them yours. This was a sensational version
Like come on guys she completely off key
D A M N ! ! ! Im literally shaking right now.
She can't hold a not and is off key. I'm convinced that if she wasn't Loretta Lynn's daughter she would have be back in Buthcer Holler weeks ago.  For someone who wanted out of L.L shadow, they sure mention it a lot to get those sympathy votes.
You did it Emmy ❤
Your MeeMaw is proud looking from heaven. What a beautiful and loving  Tribute To Loretta Lynn😊
It seriously "SUCKED". I grew up listening to Loretta Lynn and other Country greats. When this song is sung right it's something you hear and feel.. You feel the power in the vocals of Loretta Lynn and you understand every word. As the G/daughter is singing it she's singing it like it's a pop song with that mumbling so that your unable to hear the words clear and precise.  Think of Ariana Grande mumbling when she sings!!
I cried hearing this. Your grandma would be so proud ! Never could have imagined this song to be sang any different and you absolutely blew it away.
She definitely will make her grandma and family proud of this performance -- I am so captivated by this song
With you all the way,  Emmy! ❤️ God bless you all the way
What was Luke pointing at? 1:24
Meh
I’m Lost for words 🔥
This performance was so heart wrenching. Time stood still. What a beautiful rendition 💖 great job!!
So so blessed to hear this. ❤
Not only is she talented, but Emmy is sincere and genuine sweet young lady… this is what American Idol is about and that’s why she’s getting my vote!
That was brilliant!
Her voice sounded so amazing here best performance yet 😊
The first time I was moved by her. Best performance for her.
Just viewed. So beautiful. I saw her grandmother perform that song many years ago. I know she is so proud of her granddaughter. God Bless...
this performance was beautiful and a tear jerker. i've loved Loretta as long as I can remember. went to hurricane Mills and toured everything there. was amazing.
I loved how she made it her own
Honoring Loretta by carrying on her legacy of performing. ❤❤❤
Sorry , I know some things need updated but not Loretta.  I was disappointed
Beautiful ❤❤
As Loretta Lynn's son is having kidney failure.. this girl is winning American Idol... yeah thats definitely blood sacrifices confirmed
I love how she made it her own and didnt try to do it like Loretta.
A beautiful coal miners granddaughter you are Emmy❤
When she started belting it out, I lost it 😭
YouTube censorship- can’t handle the truth? She is HORRIBLE.
She definitely has lorrettas high cheek bones.  Great job!
Nope she don't need to be signing her songs what is wrong with y'all she messed it up so bada
Won't never be her grandmother
I didn’t like her rendition
I really liked her interpretation of that classic song but...she is unrecognizable from her audition.  I don't know why the producers think they have to put so much war paint on the contestants.  She's a very pretty and very wholesome looking girl and that,  coupled with her lovely voice made more of an impression on me.
Amazing performance.
I don't care 'who' she is. All I know is I liked this better than the original. Well played.
So good!
Grandma is smiling down
Cool that she sung it but I don't think it was that good
I think she sang totally off key.
This was the most emotional performance of the night.  Absolutely Beautiful!
Loretta Lynn sang this for her Daddy… Emmy sang it for Loretta Lynn❤❤❤
I wouldn’t of gone for this no doubt they made you do it, you were trying to do your own thing and they wanted you to pay “tribute” to your grandmother for the shows rating that’s all it was
Well, I think that we've found our winner 🏆
Emmy’s voice made me pause and listen this song tears. Baby girl keep going may God always bless you. Your voice is important and honoring your Memaw
Removing negative comments and replies from this thread will not make her look better. You’ve been duped. She’s fake - not at all shy. Already been on the Opry. Guess that exposure didn’t help her career.
I was waiting so patiently for this moment, and it did not disappoint.  I believe she may have just gave herself a shot at winning.
Simply WOW!  She really flipped that song on its head and made it something completely new, and dare I say it, even more heartfelt and emotional than the original.  I don't say that lightly as I literally grew up on Loretta Lynn.  I watched "Coal Miners Daughter" in the theaters during its original release.  All we had was one AM country music radio station to listen to.  I get the background completely.  We had Loretta Lynn albums and 8-track tapes with her and Conway.  I loved her Crisco commericals (you remember those?) and watched her on Hee Haw and the awards shows.  So yes, I get the history and that's why I don't say that lightly.  I wish her grandmother could have heard that.  I could see her in the audience brushing away the proud tears as if she were sitting beside Patsy.  Great job!
Ditch the makeup.  There’s 100 girls that look like that.  There’s only one you. Don’t cover her up.
Omg....
So beautiful!! Love the way your doing "your way".
Bless her heart. I can't imagine how many emotions she must have been feeling singing that. 🥹
She is not as good as MeMaw, Good, but it was her own.
Emmy, like you, I've lost loved ones. My mother passed away a year ago. My brother passed six weeks later. Oh, my precious Daddy is dying now.   My family listened to your Grandmother sing all those years. I can hear them now in my memories. I can hear Loretta in you, sweet girl. She never left your side.  With tears in my eyes, I see, oh I know her spirit will carry you far.  You are truly my American Idol.   God bless
Here grandmother was all around her she would had got to see her perform i know she would proud she her own still. Go team emmy Russell i am from eastern ky not even hour away from where Loretta was from it brought back memories from hearing grandma siging it good luck
Absolutely beautiful.  Loretta would be so prod of her.
Loretta is looking down so proudly. What a truly beautiful rendition.
So let’s see judges give her three songs to choose from one of which being her grandma’s iconic hit?  No bias there at all.
This gave me chills
I'm sure it's a beautiful song, well now I can understand what she's saying
I do not like this at all
I’m an instant fan.
I am from Spain and I don’t understand the  hype about Emily . Abi Carter is much better in my opinion. Is it because of her grandmother ? . Please enlighten me 🙏
I've never felt so emotional from a performance on Idol and I've watched every single season. I was a bawling mess watching this.
I am still wowed about the fact that she's Loretta Lynn's granddaughter!  Loretta is a legend!  Emmy is a fantastic song writer and her voice is beautiful!  She has a career in the music industry for sure!  😊💖
This was her best performance and I really haven't been a fan of hers since day 1 but I give credit for singing and amazing emotional vocal .
She got the biggest % voting
Emmy is literally angelic when she's on the keys... 🤯
This is how to celebrate Her Grandmother Loretta.
I DON'T think so,you can hear her breathing. Patty Booker did this song WAAAYY better
damn i am a wreck from this. so absolutely beautiful.
So different with the original. Amazing 👏 🎉💪🏻❤️
Wow
Fantastic!!
This is one of the best American songs ever written.  It's good to see a strong family tradition carry on.
I got chills
I love it
WOW now I’m crying. So beautiful, her mama looks just like her Grandma.
Famous relatives should NOT be on American idol, PERIOD. The show is for people who need to discovered   This chick could've went to Nashville and been signed on the spot. This is bullshit if she wins
My papaw was killed in the coal mines, before i was even born. My dad was just 16 years old when he lost him. There was an explosion and my papaw helped save other coal miners lives by pushing them out of the way and he took the blunt of the blast! He was burned over 99 percent of his body, he was tough though. He lived another eight hours in the hospital. I am so proud that i have that kind of blood running through my veins! Great Job Emmy! I know your Grandma is very proud of you! Thank you for singing this song so beautifully and kind. GOD  Bless You! I cant wait to meet you papaw in Heaven one day! I hope i make you, my dad and most of all my heavenly father proud!!!
Emmy really had a great American Idol moment with this performance!  I had my doubts about her, but this was the best performance of the night.  Lovely arrangement, great vocals and genuine emotion 🤗
No matter where it goes you are a star and always will be ,from a true country boy for 75 years (Butch)  Leonard J Stone
Emmy is the only one this season who always leaves a lasting impression, either her songs stick in my head a lot or I come back to relisten to every one of her Idol performances.  And there is that gracious smile at the end of every performance.  I can't be the only one as every one of her Youtube Idol performance videos either leads or is close to the top in views, this one here is already over a half million views and counting.  These Youtube views can be a good indication of her broad appeal and that she's not likely to be voted off any time soon.
Meemaw is smiling down on this beautiful girl. ❤️ What a tribute!
Amazing! Made me cry too
Emmy has finally come into her own!! Brought me to tears, she did!!
Nice rendition. Not too crazy about the piano playing, though.
Why change the tune of the song?  Originality is best. Doesn’t have the same feel at all  Emmy does have a beautiful voice though. ❤
She sounds like she’s singing in a psych ward.
She's much more talented than this slaughtered song would indicate....
I rarely ever cry to any performances on Idol, but this one did it for me. That was such a heartfelt and genuine performance. What great way to honor her grandma. Best performance to date!
Amazing!  brought tears to my eyes.
Love you made it her own
Best performance ever on this show!
Amazing!!! 👏👏👏❤
Sounds like Samantha mathers.
Carbon Copy, in looks etc. And such a beautiful, amazing voice! OWNED!
So beautiful! What a beautiful way to honor her grandmother. ❤
Just the look of the other contestants when they panned to them basically tells you all you need to know….
Her musical genetics are shining through in a most angelic way.  One of the most beautiful performances on this show ever 💫💫✨🌌🪽🪽🪽
From the first note, I jumped in, hook, line, and sinker. can’t wait to hear you tell other stories with that voice!
I love that Katie chose this to show her that she can stand out on her own without forgetting where she came from. What a great lesson from an artist who had to learn that on her own as well? I think honestly Katie wanted to bring that emotion out in her to make her stronger in the coming weeks. It's such a powerful thing when emotion is brought out in music like that and a lot of the time when artists are just coming out of their shell they need something like that to remind them where they came from and start putting the emotion in with the logistics of the music. Which is truly a lesson to be learned.
I really like her but only as a song writer she murdered this song ..sorry Emmy 😢
not saying she deserves to win but she deserves to win
If you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say it at all…she did an amazing job it doesn’t have to be the same it was loving and heartfelt, and an ode to her grandmother. Have some class negative people.
Emmy stepped up this whole season. Each weekend she is growing and proving she’s taking the criticism to heart and letting it teach her. I hope she makes top 3
She literally ruined her grandma's song ... doesn't even in anyway do just to the song...
Don't ruin your grandmother's song. Stick to pop music, where your voice is intended to be.
Emmy you made this song even more beautiful. This gave me chills and tears. My mom loved this song. I remember her singing it when I was a kid. She too was a coal minors daughter. Girl you were born to be a star ⭐️ a star ⭐️ you are.
Pay attention to how everyone's jaw was dropped. Truly says it all.
Absolutely horrible....an besides she should not be allowed on idol...give some if the kids that come from nowhere.....if she wins idol is rigged an fake as hell
❤❤❤❤OMG  EMMY. Me and my wife saw your grandmother at the mountaineer in west virgina   years back and my life was forever changed . you have done it all over again  and was the most amazing life changing moment god bless you for doing that  it was so heart felt  . you got this all day
I think it will be between her and Jack
Her grandma would have loved this.
I think I held my breath during the entire performance. I love how Emmy took Loretta's signature song and made it her own. Well done Emmy and thank you ❤
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Emmy Russell was meant to sing❤❤
Her voice is beautifully haunting so unique. Every song she sings is done perfectly ❤
It's a beautiful version of this classic song.  Emmy, your grandmother would be proud.
This one brought old man to tears Memories... memories cling to them and stand proud.. She's looking down with smile and lifted you at end 💞
I hate how contemporary singers sing! Why don’t people sing in the old style anymore? So much better than this garbage
That was incredible 😊
Did not think it possible but she took her Grandma's story to a whole new level.
Pretty voice, but I don't like how they changed it.
I’m not crying 😭
I love Julia and Abi… their vocal skills are out of this world… but Emmy may have just won this competition❤
She did an amazing job her grandma would have been proud
Wow
Chills <3 Love. This.
Emmy is a star!   Great songwriter and unique, beautiful, emotional voice.   She’s also an inspiration.  She took her Grandmother’s anthem and made it a loving tribute to the Queen, Ms. Loretta Lynn.  Emmy has a chance to win it all!!!
Awesome,  so nice and charming vocal
My parents named me Lynn because they loved Loretta, they took me to Hurricane Mills when I was 13 and seeing this stiired up some wonderful memories of all the people who arent here with me in this world any more but they live forever in my heart and my memory.... I will always be a coal miners great granddaughter too.. Just beautiful and keep shining bright like the star you are Emmy ❤
The performance I was waiting for. Love you Loretta.   She will make you proud.
You all are being duped. She isn’t shy and already sang on the Grand Ole Opry with Willie Nelson’s son. SO FAKE.
You know. I was surprised when she took the last spot on Sunday nights episode. Don’t get me wrong I liked her but I just didn’t expect it, the Monday night she comes out and does this and just wow… I have listened to this so many times now and tear up every time. I now see the piece I was missing and am glad she is still in it!
So fake and can’t sing a lick.
She will be crowned as the winner without a doubt. Her lower notes register is fantastic; the blend of vocal huskiness with bird-like tones is iconic, and her dynamic soft range is well equalized. Subconsciously, she engages with high oxytocin levels for neural vocal methods to replenish the gap in her phrasing, stylistic tonality.
ALOHA & MAHALO~🤙
I'm sure the Grand ole Opry  will have her perform anytime.  It would be cool if she's in the final and she gets to perform there. It would be fantastic!!!
She left the parts of the song  about her mama scrubbing her clothes on the wash board out.
Only there because of Grandma.. Very little talent
Let me just say this,  Emmy Russell.  👉 When you sang your Grandma's song, on American Idol, that was your true self.  I'm  praying for you. Just be YOU, and  you will be blessed!! BIG HUGS 🤗
Decent voice, but why so many "these days " go for the "exasperated " sound? Carry that tune, don't abandon it
Tbh, it’s like she almost sings the same thing every time. No variety
Her mom looks just like Loretta!
Such a beautiful redition of the song and I'm sure you made your grandmother so proud.  Just this old woman's sentiments.  Now go on and win this thing.  We sure want to hear more.
I believe it’s pretty rare for an artist to sing an enormously popular song and make me believe they are telling me their own life story. That was absolutely amazing and such a beautiful way to honor her grandma. ❤
Brilliant. I got chills.
Un no
Beautiful
It was a spiritual experience hearing amd seeing Emmy sing this song❤ So much love, which is what this world needs very much now. God bless you Emmy❤❤❤
Why do I feel like Patsy Cline and Loretta are looking down on this baby and just proud as they can be
This was amazing, it made me tear up, beautiful job Emmy!!!
Loretta was holding her hand.....just beautiful! Family is everything!
Honestly this performance may have saved her, after Justice, scarlet, jayna, Ronan, dang this series could’ve been one of the best and they’ve actually screwed up this hard. She was beautiful and the rendition was incredible.
Ummm. Am I missing something? Loretta was a country music legend during her time. This girl, not so much.
That was amazing!
She played one chord
The expression on McKenna Breinholt's face at 1:53
What watch am i on? I lost count. She pulled out the confidence AND ALL the notes!!! YES EMMYYYYYY
Chills!! Amazing ❤️
It’s like her entire life was building up to this very moment in time… Incredible. 😢❤
Easily her best performance of the entire show!! Incredibly beautiful!!
Her tone and style are amazing!  I bet her Grandma is sooo proud.
I hardly ever comment on YouTube but that was amazing!! Made me tear up!! Your grandma is looking down smiling 😊😢.
She looks so much like Crystal Gayle-it's uncanny!
That's just went straight to the soul. Absolutely beautiful
Absolutely the loveliest tribute 😭😭😭 Emmy, you’re such a star that the ones in the sky are jealous of your light❣️🫶🫶
This made me 😭 This was hard for Emmy in so many ways and I'm so proud of her for making it her own but yet honoring her sweet MeMaw....Mrs Loretta Lynn!!  This was my favorite version of this song I've EVER heard & it will be on repeat!! Emmy...I can just see MeMaw & Pasty Cline holding hands, watching down with the biggest smile on there faces!! That was your moment sweet girl❤
This made my heart swell - what a beautiful tribute. ❤
KB’s & McKenna’s faces in the cutaway……
Im sorry nobody can touch the original sorry Emmy but you gotta go
That girl is going to win. Not a doubt in my mind.
Just amazing 🤩
I seen her memew 3 times & heard her sing that song.  I loved l loretta very much
Chills and tears 😭🥹😭
Wow Emmy this was amazing! I May have shed a few tears🌟
She’s not my favorite and not as strong as the others HOWEVER; I think she’d be a good country storyteller type singer similar to Taylor swift… I didn’t think Taylor was the best singer when she first started and look at her now. (I always thought she was an excellent lyricist though
WOW! Absolutely amazing!
Probably her best yet
Absolutely beautiful!
Beautiful
Fun fact: my mama babysat Loretta’s kids while she was on stage. She was also Dolly partons bodyguard 😄
She has a great voice but why would you change the style of this song away from the original? It's hard to beat the original.
Absolutely Beautiful and Loretta would be very pleased and proud of Emmy.  Emmy has such a unique style without over singing or yelling and hollering....I love her!
This song is obviously personal to her. Not a fan of the arrangement or her timid voice, but the feeling she put into it was touching.
Lol nope
One of my most favorite songs of all-time written by the amazing, one and only, Loretta Lynn, and here you, Emmy, made it your own, so amazingly, so gracefully, and so beautifully.  Go Emmy!  ❤ 💯
OMG Congratulations Emmy for making through to The Top 7, You deserve It & When You sing ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' By Her Late Grandmother Loretta Lynn During your performance of American Idol Last night Wow I thought you did such A great & Amazing Job, You sound like you were singing from the heart, It was Beautiful & Very Entertainment!!! 👏👏👏👏
That was the best so far for  her . I loved her grama . ❤️
Beautiful performance. Wow.
Can’t stop watching it, Emmy. I love how you paused at the end, leaving the space of “daughter” open. I could tell you were saying granddaughter in your heart. So beautiful. Keep coming out of your cocoon, beautiful butterfly. All of us coal miner granddaughters are praying for you! You already won. ❤
it was like she was in a trance...so pure.
Wow, I sure hope AM Idol isn't going to rig the votes like they used to. It's getting weird now.
Wow, just perfect.
It’s so cool that she honored her ancestors like this! She made it sound like her own song, but we all know it’s Loretta’s. She did justice to it, and her family must be so proud of her!
Nah this ain't it broh.
I love her authenticity in her voice. ❤
I'm crying because that was so far off the original it was not for me and I love that song.
Beautiful, she honored her grandma & made it her own!!
that performance was so beautiful, I almost started crying.
What a beautiful song! I wasn’t following American Idol until I accidentally clicked through the channels and heard this song that brought me to tears. Why am I not listening to this on the RADIO NOW!!! BEAUTIFUL You got my VOTE!!! ❤❤❤
This song is so well known, i didnt think a remake could ever be done. Damn. I was so wrong. She made this song her own & did her memaw & family PROUD. Love her storytelling in a different way from Lorettas.❤
She sounds like Nightbird.
That was so touching! Her grandmother would be very proud! 😭
I cried as she sang😢😭😭😭 I love this song❤❤❤❤
Best performance of the season. She needs to release this as a cover.
She did an amazing job on her grandmother's song. I bet her grandma is so proud of her.
Your grandmother is smiling down on you. You did her proud!
I just don't get the attraction of this vocalist....I see her like TS....a storyteller, not a vocalist....oh well.....good luck to her
Congratulations Emmy Russell!
❤
This was a home run performance! She honored her Grandma so beautifully and also took an almost 60 year old country song and made it sound current. Emmy truly shines when she channels her inner storyteller. Brilliant!
226K views in 16 hours.  WOW!
She made the tears flow.....Fantastic Emmy Russell  F A N T A S T I C!!
This girl can sing. Gets ya right in the feels!
That was soooo good!  It told the story in a new way and it made it really emotional as you could imagine it all really well.
Beautiful but she doesn't need this competition
Queen Emmy ⚘️
Why is it that we constantly get flogged with Emmy as "Loretta Lynn's granddaughter?" She truly believes she isn't Emmy, she is Loretta Lynn's granddaughter, Loretta Lynn's granddaughter, and don't you forget it! Who is Emmy??? Emmy, come out and show yourself if you believe in yourself!
❤ this was absolutely beautiful Emmy. I had to share a few tears.
I can’t wait to hear her sing that at the Grand Ole Opry.  Generations of Americans saying a prayer and hearing an angel sing a song they grew on.  I haven’t cried that hard since Mama went to the kingdom.
I can’t watch this without balling absolutely beautiful you made your grandma proud❤
Beautiful singer, love the song ❤
It was a heartfelt performance! She has been our favorite from the first show!!! My husband and I  cried! It was so sweet and beautiful!!!  Great performance Emmy!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is what happens when hard times writes a song I've always loved this song I remember first time Loretta sang it in Nashville.  An the way Emma sang it an put her twist to it I do believe she could own this version her version of it an do just as well as her beloved memam.
This made my eyes water!🤧 This was amazing Emmy, very stunning! I don’t understand how people could hate on her? She is so wholesome and amazing!!! Amazing Emmy!!! Katy was so right also!!
Oh my gosh ao beautiful. I got chills bumps and she had me in tears.❤❤❤
She's amazing❤❤❤
Chills!! Sooo beautiful!! You could tell singing that song meant everything to her!! Loretta Lynn would have been sooo proud!! 😢❤️
Did she go off key a bit?
Very great job girl. I grew up listening to your Memaw sing...❤
her and abi set a whole new bar wow
She’s so good! It is time for her to cycle out the fear or that’s she’s not enough. She’s incredible! I don’t want to have to worry about her nerves as a listener. Believe in you!
Very nice 👌 👍
Absolutely beautiful! Memaw is smiling down on her!
Wow! Holy Goodness. That Was So Great.
Awful
She's great.she would be great in country too❤
I think she destroyed it! Nice voice but she ruined the song!
I can't believe how much we have lowered our standards when it comes to natural talent, this is awful, another youth riding on the name
Full chills
This was Incredible and Tears came out
Goosebumps ❤❤❤❤so BEAUTIFUL GIRL!! 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Most Beautiful Performance 🎭 I’ve Ever Seen and Heard ♥️🎶♥️🎶♥️🎶♥️🎶♥️
Her Grandma would be giving a standing ovation. Beautiful performance.
Abi sings with her pipes, Emma sings with her emotions. Both are  song sellers.
Amazing ... loved her version of this song!
I'd like to see her do things other than ballads/slow songs
Her and Jack were my two favorite performances tonight along with them singing Hello.
The nepotism has been on full display with her the whole time.
I'm so glad I lived during the 60s, 70s when artists sounded unique.   This girl sounds like every other female singer today.
Emmy fantastic job Memaw would be so very proud.
What a beautiful tribute to her Memaw Loretta Lynn ❤🎉.  Her mother in the audience crying was so touching ❤.  Best of luck to Emmy Russell 🎉🎉🎉 . She definitely has a great future in the music industry ❤🎉
Retty would be proud.
I got a tear in my eye u could feel the love and tribute to her memaw in this song
She's a natural!
I'm not a fan of her voice, but she has a good one. She should show her belt out voice
Beautiful rendition but I think she’s a bit overrated due to her grandma. Talented but not to this degree.
Sweet rendition and tribute to loretta.
Tears, but no words.....just......no words 😭
This stopped me in my tracks. A very special performance x
Beautiful Job Emmy! Your Grandma would be so very proud of you! Congratulations!
I mean, come on! Beautiful. Simply beautiful.
I hope you win Emmy you are such a beautiful, sweet, soul.   You have grown so much, and are so very talented sweet Beauty.  I melt when I hear your beautiful angelic voice
Absolutely amazing and beautiful. She did her grandma proud. She put her own twist to parts of it and it was amazing. Great job. She has talent and deserves to win.
such a storyteller voice that sucks your emotions in !!!!! The next Miranda Lambert with that emotional voice!!!!
Why did she have to slow it down and ruin it, just do it the way it's supposed to be. It's not supposed to be sad or sappy.
Great job Emmy!!! Your grandma is looking down on you and so proud of what you are doing. You took one of the most iconic songs and made it your own while still honoring your grandmas memory! From a coal miners daughter to a col miners great granddaughter! Keep up the good work! You have an amazing voice!❤
One of the best performances I've ever seen.
The only sad part is she can't honestly feel this song as she sings. It genuinely takes away from the performance.. She never lived this life and  can't understand it's meaning.
She is good but she has from day one she has let everyone know who her grandmother was I would be proud also but …enough
This was her best performance yet.  Really came out of her shell on this one!
Coal Miners Great-Granddaughter!  And those words mean infinitely more to her than to anyone!
Felt that
I can't wait until you record your own album!  This song needs to be on it along with your amazing original songs.  Please go on tour.  I want to see in person and bring my 10 year old daughter.
She gave us an Idol moment that will never be forgotten
Merci Miss Emmy
Absolutely stunning
This got me to vote for her again. I think she really proved the haters wrong with this song, it was amazing, and it was up there with anything McKenna or Abi have done.   The way she slowed down the song was brilliant.
She has the voice the rest don't regarding making it Big in her genre.
And this, kids, is how you sing in cursive AND enunciate
America she is not better than KB, or Mia!!!! Stop feeling sorry for her, it's about singing not her damn sob story!!! I'm sure she grew up entitled to the better things in life!!!!
Such great talent.....I'm sure her grandmother is smiling.  Great job 👏
Didn't see her resemblance to Loretta till now.
Cried as I listen to her sing her memaws song.  Made it her own.  Love Emmy Russell.🩷
This was nice but no way should she be in the top three.
So glad Emmy chose this song even though she was so emotional about singing it, saying this was the song her memaw always closed with.  At one point it seemed she just couldn’t get the word out and I believe it was supposed to be “the memory of a coal miners granddaughter”  (but I could be wrong).  Anyway it was beautiful and even though Emmy’s voice isn’t  quite as country as Loretta Lynn’s, there were still certain words that were just very reminiscent of her grandma. Emmy’s style also reminds me of her grandma.  Very good job Emmy.  No matter how far you go in this competition, you will be remembered and you made your family and grandma very proud.  Btw, you are not only a great songwriter but a great singer.  ❤️
I knew miss Loretta we talked everyday on here i actually talked to her the night before she passed away  she wanted me to see her but I was to far away  💔 I wish u would have went now I miss my friend 😢😢💔 😢 Emmy looks just like her
Terrific
What an amazing version by Emmy. It was as beautiful as Megan's Coach's Pick last season.
She is amazing!  Everyone should leave such a legacy.
Wow!!!! So beautiful!!! I grew up singing this song as a kid…
Omg This brought me to tears 😭 just wonderful
This was absolutely perfect.  She has her own way of doing it and still sounds like her grandmother in a way.  I loved it and and think she can be top 3.  Emmy the beautiful and talented Loretta Lynn was looking down and watching you with pride as you sang her song.
Look she sings ok but in my opinion if she really wanted to do it on her own she wouldn't have told the judges she was Loretta Lynn granddaughter to begin with. Theirs alot  of great singer out their. But mark my words she will win not on her talent but because who she is. And that's a shame for the other kids that don't have a famous grandmother. Just my opinion
AWSUM!!! Ths wud definitely b a hit!!!!👏💜
The torch has been passed...
So powerful ❤
The faces of the other contestants said it all. Really beautiful. We support you Emmy.❤
Loretta Lynn would be so proud. I can guarantee she is looking down from heaven
No
Well done ! Beautiful lady that did justice to her late grandmothers song. Godspeed young lady.
Wow she did a beautiful rendition of that song.
B E A U T I F U L  !!!
Yup. I cried. And I didn’t even vote for her last time. Y’all were right, voted for her this time.
She reminds me if LeAnn Womack
wow I got Goosebumps all the way watching from Perth Western Australia performance of the night for me
That was the best she has sounded. Stunning.
So incredible!! She has the most beautiful voice!! Keep being you!! So amazing!!!
Beautiful.  I had tears.  Use your wings Emmy and keep flying. What a wonderful performance in honor of your grandmother.  Ignore the nasty people.  Keep shining.  😊
If you are going to honor Loretta Lynn - Well, she was born a coal miner's daughter In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler They were poor, but they had love That's the one thing that her daddy made sure of He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar  Well, she was born a coal miner's daughter In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler They were poor, but they had love That's the one thing that her daddy made sure of He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar  Her daddy worked all night in the Van Leer coal mines All day long in the field, a-hoin' corn Her Mommy rocked the babies at night And read the Bible by the coal-oil light Everything would start all over, come break of mornin'  Her Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay Her Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day While she’s seen her fingers bleed To complain there was no need She'd smile in her mommy's understanding way  In the summertime they didn't have shoes to wear But in the wintertime, they’d all get a brand new pair From a mail order catalog, money made from sellin' a hog Her Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere  Yeah, she was proud to be a coal miner's daughter She remember well, the well where she drew water The work they done was hard At night they’d sleep 'cause they worked hard She never thought of ever leavin' Butcher Holler  Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then And it's so good to be back home again Not much left but the floor, nothin' lives here anymore Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter
1:40 will win her this content till about 2:12
So happy she has overcome her fears, I will always remember you for Memaws Guitar. If you win this Idol think please sing it! Fan from when you first came out with grandma! Youve got this Emmy
She did a decent job.It was heartfelt. On another note there hasn't been one performance by Jack blocker that's been impressive.i don't get it. I stopped watching American idol as soon as the public starts voting. I mean Jack blocker come on he's got such a long way to go he's just learning .
I love her. She's got The great Loretta's cheek bones.❤ 2:37 2:37
I do not have a social media account.  Any bullies over their got some bad to say about her,  come see me.    Mis Russell,   this was beautiful.   If the Whole world was watching,  they would have witnessed something great.
Best performance of the night!! Im in TEARS😢
I sure wish her late grandma  could see her on American Idol she would be so proud
She should’ve left a while ago like top 10
Her grandma would be very proud of her right now. 👏👏👏👏👏
Just don’t see top 7.
Greetings from Carolina.  Thanks for sharing this song with the world. We could feel each word in our hearts. Hopefully, one day, you will record this song for the new generation.  Thank you
Yeah, this is her style and it seems production nailed it here. The last few performances were rough.
sO SWEET ... my little black horse, emmy.
Certainly shut the critics up 😂
I knew she would eventually sing one of her grandmother's songs, and I was worried about how it would go, because Emmy's style and voice are so very different from Loretta's. This was well beyond anything I could have hoped for, and I now feel ashamed for worrying. The performance was 100 percent Emmy Russell, but paid beautiful homage to her legendary Memaw and the hardworking great-grandparents whom Emmy never knew. Emmy Russell is the living legacy of that poor family from Butcher Hollow Kentucky, and I know they are so proud.
Well, I believe we just watched not just Idol history, but country music history be made. The passing down of the guard from the old to the new. It’s beautiful.   Good job Emmy. Keep it up. We love you!
Wasn't a dry eye in the house watching this crazy ..
Wow, they change this girl into a woman. She looks beautiful but sometimes they change the artist so much.
jewel-esque...kindof.
Some people on here want to drag her down because of who she is and say they want her to be her own person but at the same time decide to   have higher expectations because of who she is. You can't have it both ways and as long as you continue to do so, your opinion will mean nothing.
Its amazing how she made her grandmas song her own and they sound nothing alike
Goosebumps❤️
I really don’t love her voice. She doesn’t annunciate clearly and she sounds like a child. Sorry.
The only thing that I have to say about is that her piano playing didn't seem to go with what she was singing.
She just did her grandma proud. That was just beautiful.
Not saying to be negative I think she tries to sound like someone like an indie taylor swift instead of having her own voice. Not really a fan of the whisper singing out of the corner of her mouth but i do think she can sing especially when hitting the higher notes. Shes just in her head too much but really hard to feel bad for someone who is talented and gorgeous. When she figures out who she is she will sound better. All it will take is a look in the mirror.
i love her she grown on me the most just so pure
I'm crying. This performance and the version of the song are so beautiful and emotional. Emmy Russell gave her best performance so far. The atmosphere she created, the intimate and sweet version with the piano, very deeply sung. One of the best moments of the year💚
It felt like I wasn't even breathing towards the end. That's how engaging Emmy's performance was. It was hard to hold back tears. This was so touching and beautiful
I am in tears right now ❤🥺😭
❤😭
nice voice your grandmother is proud of you.
She's gonna win
Oh my goodness. Talk about riding on someone's coattails.
🤧I wasn't expecting to be brought to the brink of tears over this performance; phew
1:40 let them eat cake Emmy
Beautiful ❤
wish u wouldnt said COAL MINERS GRANDDAUGHTER......the crowd wouldve screamed!    lovely rendition!   love ur family!
All the judges were crying! As was I. Great job! 🫶👏
I’m not hearing it. Not sure why she’s made it this far? Family pulling some strings.
Truly magnificent, a watershed moment in the competition, the best performance of the season, ... Abi was the closest to her tonight and she was amazing as well, and then the rest of the competition was so far away from them.  This woman has ensured so much hate from so many and she rises to the occasion with a performance for the ages...and delivers a knockout performance. Well done Emmy.
Emmy has a sweet genuine soft sound to her vocals ! Her grandma is in Heaven with a smile on her face . Just a beautiful v well done performance.  ❤
Last night when she did one of my favorite songs growing up all the small things by blink 182!!!! to this song it was truly amazing. I loved her before but this right here is what dreams are made from absolutely stunning
She butchered this iconic song. Emmy is a sweet young woman and I hope she's found some confidence on the show, but honestly, if she wants to be recognized for her own achievements then she needs to stop being Loretta's granddaughter and create her own thing.
Wonderful ❤
Just tears of Joy for the Love that radiated from your voice Ms.EMMY. YOUR GRAM SEEN YOU FROM HEAVEN LORETTA LYNN THE COAL MINERS GRANDDAUGHTER.  MS EMMY  YOU ARE TRULY BLESSED. BEAUTIFUL VOICE!!! GOD BLESS U🙏❤️✝️🇺🇸🌻
i see 8 top sevens😭
Just about a good as it gets. Thank you Ms Emmy!
I don't know... I have goosebumps when I listened her high note
Well, my mind is officially blown 🤯
That was powerful!
She kept the vocal in such a soft storytelling mode, but with a few higher notes to make an emphasis. Her grandmother is looking down proud, along with her friend, Patsy Cline.
I got chills all over, while crying, so happy she chose me-maws song! BEAUTIFULLY DONE EMMY!! ❤
Her best performance!!!!
She sang her grandmother’s song, in a way that’s deeper than the ocean. So much grace and elegant emotions here.
Sounds like the right time for Emmy to honor her grandmother her way and she successfully made it her own as it was my favorite performance she has done throughout her time on this show! I’m not sure she can win this competition at this point but I do think she will go places as an artist no matter what happens throughout her time on American Idol!
Beautiful❤simply stunning ❤
An absolutely special performance. One of the best of the whole season. Emmy IMO locked up spot in final
This was incredible. I love her indie story telling style. She makes you feel it all. THATS IS WHY SHE IS STILL HERE.
Being Loretta Lynn's granddaughter is the only reason she even got to the Top 24.
that was amazing ..............
Best performance from her! Beautiful! 👏Made me tear up. 😅❤
I guess American idol cant count? 🤣
her best performance but she should of done this weeks ago she may of saved her self a little while longer but shes gonna have to step it up standing and barely singing aint going to cut it.. this may have bought her another week
this was so heartfelt and beautiful - her and abi were in a different league this round
