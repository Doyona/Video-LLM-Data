For me Pidcocks win was the performance of the games by a Brit and shame on the French supporters for jeering him as he won.
The greatest dive bomb of all time from TOm
One of the greatest mtb races
No wonder the rest of the world hates the french..
koreztski rode into tom
What is the matter with the people in the crowd who booed? They have just witnessed an astonishing sporting achievement and a truly nail biting race.
Terrible French crowd.

Grande Braidot, gara fantastica impossible fare meglio
Que espectacular final de carrera 😊😊
As usual the miserable french lol.......
Incredible the winner came back to win after a puncture-! Amazing & *totally deserved!* 💖 I love the Olympics for how good natured /sporting it is; respectful & appreciative regardless of flags, healthy priorities - shame of the few 🤡 who betrayed that, & in front of kids. btw it's a 𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗘 not 'Follow my leader' - *TWO lines for a REASON* - & instead of following, Tom zipped thu' the other side. Koreztky tried to cut back in unaware & nearly took them both out. Most of the crowd were also unaware; just boo-ing as their hero suddenly wasn't winning. Le wnkers.. :/
Those French boos are the sweetest music to an Englishman's ear ❤
No chance against a doped road cyclist 😂
Warum ist das denn nicht mehr in der Mediathek von ARD / ZDF
Im so happy i could watch whole race
Les français, des supporters pathétiques...
thats a fair and square win. the frenchman took the wrong line, thats the problem.
WELL DONE GB !!!
Единственный шанс был, и Том его использовал идеально. Если бы они доехали до финиша, Виктор бы за счёт мощности победил.
koretzsky had power  pidcock had skills
respect Thomas but he touched Goretzky at the end no way!
Pidcock is by far the best CX MTB rider in the world. And the least likeable.
Huge win by Pidcock
so lame from the French to bohhh at Pidcock... He was just the better rider!!! WELL DONE THOMAS
pidcock has cheated, he knew very well he would not make it so he just put his front wheel in front!
I was booed in France riding the etape as I came past some French riders at the start of the climb up ventoux. . They are pathetic. I felt a bit sick for a few seconds but it encouraged me even more. They are really bad losers .
Beim Motocross geht das noch ganz anders ab.. alles im Grünen Bereich...
Save Racing !!!
The French fans' behaviour was disgraceful. Pidcock gifted the French rider 35 seconds and he still couldn't win. Poor losers the lot of them. I'm so happy for Tom and proud to be a Yorkshireman.
horrible french supporters can do only this for winner, shame
what a win! the french crowd reacted like the average football/soccer fan…
Pidcock won fair. There was enough space for both riders. The French guy made a mistake, he opened the way for pidcock instead to stay on the left and blocked him. But I think the punch from pidcock was so powerful that no one could have a chance to win
Pidcock is an absolutely deserving winner, a great sportsman, very unfair, extremely unfriendly French crowd, a disgrace.
Frenchmen booing? The British are the champions of booing: see football, Formula 1, etc
I liked the booing. 😂
If you don't know the results yet, the title: "BACK TO BACK Olympics Golds For Tom Pidcock" is not what you want to see!  For the rest I really enjoyed this 10 minute video, thanks.
I am so glad I decided to check the highligths of an event I'd never watched before. Extraordinary. The recovery, the track, the effort, the battle, the pass! Simply brilliant! Favourite moment of the games so far.
Amazing recovery and boss move by Pidcock against a brilliant field and a partizan crowd.
Frenchie made a mistake taking the long line on the outside of those two trees.
Dirty from pidkock
Despite the fact that the French, sore losers as usual, booed you, you seem served it!
Amazing race. The Frenchman was so powerful, but Pidcock is an unbelievable cyclist on the difficult terrain
british fans in the comments are just amazing.. such idiots
Camera angles are the worst and then booing wow! Sad to see that
Done French fans are disgusting. My good it was a clean overtake. What a machine!
So ye just left out how he closed the 38 second gap after the puncture at halfway?
thanks for spoiler in the title. I might have actually cared about the video otherwise
Jeez. Like watching bowling on 2 wheels.  Yawn.
Stop spoiling!!! I hope the next "big thing" is ruined for you aswell
What a fantastic race. 👏👍
I think the only thing worse than the crowd reaction was the commentary in SA. OMG!! You can’t even.
GREAT SHIT BRITAIN ☢☢☢☢
Well done Alan! South Africa’s #1 pedal pusher! Lekker!  Pidcock. You legend! Well deserved!  Great race. Sad reaction. 😢I hope everyone in the world was disappointed with such a unfortunate crowd reaction.
Nice spoiler in title.
No gold for France, perfect 😊. Nice job from Pidcock
Fortunately, he did no succeed in bringing the Frenchman down. Could have seriously injured him.
Peedcock wins, WOW
French are horrible people for booing the winner a disgrace  really
Is this even legit?
French fans booing! It was a fair and square daring overtake. Where is the olympic spirit? Norway beat the french in handball. You reap what you sow.
what a fight! great ride of both
I‘m a little bit surprised, that the lefty is still used by top athletes. It’s not easy to change the front wheel, you loose a lot of time if you have a flat tire
Not the first time I see Pidcock winning with a questionable if not dirty move. Riding into your opponent and cutting him off gets totally deserved boos from me.
For God's sake can you guys stop spoiling the result in the thumbnail!!?
French booing at the finish was disgusting..Why did the Eurosport commentary team just ignore it as though it didn't happen?
french people booing, just adding another argument being the worst olympia i have ever seen.
Nice win from Pidcock, fransmen was closing the door for himself.
Absolut super gefahren von Tom Pidcock, warum erzählt der Kommentator solch einen Blödsinn? Hört der sich das nachher selber mal an? Bisken parteiisch gewesen?
The french guy tried to cut Pidcock, when he realised he was owned. He could have stayed right, but immediately went to the left to block him, but touched him and kicked hisself out. There's nothing to blame Pidcock.
WHY not SHOW the mistake that allowed Pidcock to catch up in the first place???
Well Done!!! Pidcock did it perfectly!
The exciting finish was ended by the incident, very disappointed it ended like that as the French rider would have had a good chance in a sprint finish, he matched Pidcock's strength the whole race.
Wonderful MOMENTS. https://youtu.be/k_ivnNoizic
Tom Pidcock Gold. Surely one of the most amazing results ever!!!!!🙂🙂🙂
That was such a brilliant move by Pidcock. A bit unfortunate for Koretzky who gave it all and was probably slightly overcoocked as he missed a corner in the descent allowing Pidcock to catch back up. Pidcock was the rightful winner anyway after his impressively catching up 40 seconds.
Booing is such a low life move. What a disgrace having such little respect as the host nation. Dégueulasse!
Charles de  gaulle, Emmanuel Macron, Joan of Arc, Rene Descartes, Napoleon Bonaparte, Victor Hugo, Marie Anntoinette, Voltaire, King Louis XIV, Jean Paul Satre, Jean Paul Gaultier, Marie Curie, Alfred Dreyfus, Claude Monet,  Edith Piaf, Coco Chanel, Zinedine Zidane, Jacques Cousteau, Jacques Delors, Thierry Henry, Rene Artois from Allo Allo…..your boy took a hell of a beating.
Tom Pidcock is a legend! 2x Olympic Gold, chapeau🔥🔥🔥
A brilliant win by Pidcock, well deserved - Shame on those in crowd who booed at finish
It was the frenchmans own fault he rammed Pidcock, not the other way around. They are just bad losers.
die Schweizer Kommentar auf SRF (Thomas Frischknecht) hat so was von unfair gesagt. Man das ist doch Mann gegen Mann und kein Tussi Sport🤔im Finale
He should stick to this and not the Tour de France
This guy is from another planet or doping.
Why the booing ? Don’t you recognise an amazing battle and great effort all round ?
French booing ? not surprising they have never been a nation of grace
Wenn dein Team dir Millionen zahlt Dinge zu tun, aber du viel lieber ganz andere Sachen tust 😂
Pathethic frenchies booing lol
Stupid @eurosport spoiling
ppl were calling him out for riding mountainbike before the TDF. i'd say this medal beats a top 15 in the TDF with ease.
typisch pidcock, bei der tour nigs gerissen, "corona" erkrankt, 2wochen später topform, jaja, alles klar!!!
Everything is fair. When touching, the Englishman was ahead and there can be no complaints against him. And the French cries about injustice are pathetic excuses for losing.
Pidcocks repeatedly unfairness is now proven and shows his unsporty and mean character! Dismissed!
Yes! He fk.d korecki in the a.s without the soap! Yeaaa
fair overtaken, congrats Tom. Of course the French don't like that !
Alles fair. Pidcock überholt innen und bleibt auf seiner bahn, der franzose zieht rüber
Congratulations, Tommy!!!!
Booing from the French crowd for the winner. Shameful
Where is Nino?
Good movement by Pidcock, he clearly took the right path. There is nothing to complain about, except for the french fans booing... disgusting.
I don't really get MTB how that is not a DQ and why they can't swap to a new bike with a mechanical. Rules even sillier than the UCI for road. Just watched because Tom Pidcock was in it and he's a legend
At least ineos have won something this year lol
Incredible bike handling & race brain from Tom 🙌🏻🥇🙌🏻
Bravo.. Tom.. you are huge..
He block
Great ride Alan!!! Congratulations!!!
absolutely briliant,Tomas Pidcock is a monster  bike rider,well deserved.
What a pity the wallie won...
Fascinating battle for Gold that is worthy of an Olympic contest.
Pidcock came and showed these Sunday cyclists what racing is and not riding single file for all laps.... 😁
Trash audience
Thats mountain bike Racing !!! 🔥🔥🔥 back to back
Upvote if you want Eurosport to stop spoiling the results.
Such a brilliant attack by Pidcock. Frenchmen clearly slept that, but thankfully braked in time and both kept the medals instead of crash.
Tom był w każdym calu najlepszy
That must be a dsq
Good attack by Pidcock, he was in front, stayed towards the left side. He was just better, fair and deserved win.
No mercy shown once again, just like with Schwarzbauer in the XCE worlds last year. Bad luck with the puncture and strong comeback for sure -  but a shame that he makes his moves on the cost of other people crashing...
