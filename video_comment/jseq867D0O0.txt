Okay now with LittleMiss is out this is just a transition song for this amazing rebranding !
I absolutely love little miss but no way people are hating on this it’s so good too in my opinion😭
Came here after their release of 'Little Miss'

NEX2Y です。キレキレダンスで、sexyでいいですね👍

WATCHING COMMAS WHILE WAITING FOR LITTLE MISS RELEASE ❤❤❤
0:22 little miss 😮😮😮😮😮🐧🐧🦂🦂🦎🦎🦄🦄💒🏩
Yess Little Miss
Can't wait for the comeback!
Wait this song slaps so hard??? Why is going on with the promotions?
Why is the camera so shaky jyp spend some money on them I know you have it
"I can get it on my own so you better put in work", why do I feel like they are talking to JYP like FR.
Katseye 2.O
Guys please read the title its a choreography version thats why it like this and if you watch their shorts you’ll see that they filmed an actual mv
AMOOO
Isso está perfeito 🔥🫦
The song reminds me of “So What” by Loona.
❤
amoooo
COMMAS BABYYY
First time i know this group 😊
what does ‘im like commas’ mean??
JYP SPEND SOME MONEY ON GIRLSET 😖
I genuinely think they have so much potential if it wasn’t for their company not promoting them
OMG I LOVE JYP GIRL SO MUCH IM FROM CAMBODIA FAN✨🇰🇭
THIS SONG IS SOO GOOOOOOD. I KNOW THE BUDGET IS LOW BUT THE STYLING OF THE MEMBERS EAAAATTTTT
In  jyp nation variety show I really miss VCHA ❤ I am crying help
Oh my VCHA girls I really miss you so much THANKYOU for your comeback❤
멤버들은 상당히 괜찮은거 같은데...노래가 별로인듯..ㅋ
caraca a anitta debutou no kpop e eu n tava sabendo 🥵🔥🔥
The choreo is FIRE
Kendall's Voice!!

Let's stre..am little miss better
Vcha.
I just love this
Kpop to generic girl group
thid dong couldnt be more perfect, the vocals the fsce card everything is so goregouss my god
115k
This is so good I love the vocals in the style but at least give them more set outfits There’s only about two in the dance break isn’t that good there’s no high notes to finish the chorus off but here are the set ideas  1. The dressing room  2. A vault I mean hear me out it talks a lot about money  3. Last part can just be to shuffle between the two  4. And to add touches give members solo shots so we can see who’s singing  5. This one is optional but definitely add more transitions
SALALALKAMMALLALALSLWLELE SLAAAAYYYY GIRLS 😭😭💕😭💕😭💕😭💕😭💕💕😭💕😭
Camila is very beautiful 🖤 but it's hard to say the same for her shoes and gloves..
Commasssss
The girls are asking to spend money of them but JYP 💀
Las mejoressss!! Girlsettt
🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Omggg I loveeeeee
우와  실력 엄청 늘었다
Wow I love they voice they voice is so stable ❤️🤟❤️🤩
AAAAAHHH GIRLSET LAS AMOOO QUE BELLO COOOOOMO
The tall blonde girl looks like the member of little mix
I’m so sorry the song is not good
Damn these girls even exist
Are we all gonna ignore what happened with VCHA?
Good luck girls! Hopefully the comeback gets proper MV release ❤
Is good for my❤❤❤❤❤
خوبه کل دنیا درگیر کیر منو کارامید کار زندگی که ندارید همش و کل دنیا جمع شدید در مورد کیر منو کی رو گاییدم ترانه و موزیک می‌سازید به این میگن یه دنیا درگیرته خوشم میاد لحظه به لحظه زندگی من رو از دست نمیدید اگه از دست هم بدید تکرارش رو هر جور شده می‌بینید چه سعادتی بهتر از این که کل دنیا درگیر حیرت باشه و تمام ترانه و موزیک و داستان ها و نقل محفل بودن هاتون شدم خدا رو شکر میکنم که باعث خلق موقعیت و درآمد زایی واسه حل دنیا شدم و باید جایزه برترین کار آفرین کل تاریخ جهان رو بهم بدن چون یه دنیا پیگیرمه یکیش خود تو مگه من کی هستم و چیکاره هستم که کل دنیا جمع شدید قصه دورهمیاتون شده صحبت در مورد زندگی و سبک زندگی من شدید و به طریقی هم براتون پولساز شدم بخورید و بیاشامید ولی اصراف و گوه خوری در حد خودتون بکنید که بیشترش ضرر داره براتون 😂😂😂
This felt like a strange song for a comeback considering everything. The women did flawless with all of it so not criticizing them at all--just wondering at the company's decisions here
本当に応援してる！！！🔥
La gente que escribe sobre el presupuesto del video y no se que no han leído sobre el nuevo concepto del grupo? Es evidente el mínimalismo que quieren transmitir, están acostumbrados a ver videos tipo Blackpink, TWICE, ITZY cargados de mil colores y cosas. Me encantó!
かっこいい✨再スタート頑張れ！！
Was it just me who noticed how Lexi's leg looked? 2:00
The choreography is fire! That bridge with savanna is on point. Everyone's part was out of this world. Can't wait for whats more in to come. Go Girlset!!!!
Eu sinto falta da Keely e da KG
2 million
KATSEYE you got competition…
Eyes closed at number 2❤🎉
jyp didn't spent money on them.they should get more than this mv.
im noticing a pattern with black haired leaders in kpop.........
vchaが名前変わってたの今気づいた！！びっくりー！！
CAN YOU IMAGINE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THEM AND LITTLE MIX ALL 8 WOULD MAKE GOOD CHOREOGRAPHY AND MUSIC.🤯🤩🤩
Sorry so sorry but it's giving a Rejected beside of ITZY  The debut should be better JYP spend some money on them !!!
Te apoyaré a futuro, no dejemos a las chicas
I accidentally stumbled across a looped clip from this video online. I was really drawn to the choreography, the video design, and the band members' looks. But I was very disappointed when I heard the song; it seemed too bland and generic for this group. I'll be keeping an eye on their future releases; I hope their music reaches a new level.
I remember these days
ternyata bener dianggurin JYP haha pantes member yg out jd muak
Let’s make 5million stream !
Sinceramente la música es buena , y el grupo muy talentoso , pero creo que JYP tiene que invertir más en ellas por qué el va hacer que las chicas queden en flop la música es hermosa y bueno es solo mi opinión.
Love 💓
❤❤❤❤
Great vocals
Daughter of katseye
FIREE
GIRLSET 🗣️🫦👄👄🫦
Wheres kelly
i remember seeing this a month ago thinking it's cool and nice outfits and dance and of course singing!
LETS REACH 2M SOON
💯💯💯💯💯💯
I loved 🔥🔥🔥
We need more of our girls JYPE!!
SO CLOSE TO 2M LETS GOOO
I'm afraid that jyp is just testing the water. Since this does not really stood out and the song is bare 2 fvcking minutes, I hope its not the last we'll see them.
Sorry but this song sounds just like another itzy songs that is bound to flop. JYPE needs to comes up with a more international music not some kpop music to these girls if they wanna succeed
THEY ATE THIS 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
No charisma at all!!
Keep on commenting guys
ليه احس الطبل يشبه طبل اغنيه سكيز اغنيه ceremony ؟؟؟
i absolutely love this song so much and the members are all so gorgeous!! but jyp..PLEASEEE GIVE OUR GIRLS A BETTER QUALITY MV 😓🙏
Yall ate omg
oh they all can dance and sing YESSS
Is it OK to be a kid and watch this?
I am Back
Это очень хорошо
vcha?!
1:17 Kendall's visual
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Guys don't hate jyp please support them.
❤
La canción me gusta , pero necesito mas videos de estas chicas, almenos vlogs in mini album espero please
케이팝 걸그룹 흉내내는 것으로 밖에 안보임, 경쟁사 모 그룹이 성공한 이유는 걔네도 이제서야 영 팝스타 걸그룹으로 탈바꿈 했기 때문임, 글로벌 멤버 모아놓고 케이팝 입히면 결국 코스프레 그룹으로 밖에 안보임
amoooo ahhh las amo
やっぱ可愛いわ❤何回も見にきちゃう。あと選曲神🎉パート配分も偏りなくて素晴らしい❤
Congrats you found an English comment!!!
10/10 temazo ❤
This is song is actually pretty good im addicted it just needs a higher budget

Yalll ate up, jyp we need an mv. Promote them better smh theyre actually so good
Where is the rest?
Get ready to feel the heat with PBAHMM! as they bring the fire with their hit single "Commas" This electrifying track is a perfect blend of fierce energy, catchy hooks, and stunning visuals that showcase the group's dynamic talent and charisma. with the stars glow.
Guys look at the title it’s chero ver…
Lexi Vang's ballet experience really shone through her dance dynamics 👍
wait wheres kaylee?
i love the “spend some money on me” dance move
I LOVE THIS ITS SO LITTLE MIX CODED
10.12.25
A 7 stars that Glow. ❤️💜💛🩵🤍💚🧡 ⭐️
The girls did an amazing job! I love the music but i feel like lexi didn’t get enough lyrics..??
Where's kaylee?
this is amazing! wishing them the best!
Why isnt this in  2M.
예능 출연좀 시켜봐 워크맨 아는형님 이런곳
They ate
love thisss
Savana tiene un aire a Anittaa 😍
Girlset canila ❤❤❤❤
They are so beautiful and so talented.
the fact they changed the name
Bro these girls deserve better like jyp is giving them the extract same concept as katseye but just worst like dance video in a dresser is just phsyco like they even copied parts of katseye gnarly dance
Extraño vcha😭
Camila: Emely Lexi: Me Savanna: Ana Kendall: Bianca
TBH I Don't Like This Song I Was Hoping For Something Good And It's Not Good. I'm Sorry But Girlset Is Not Setting With Me. I'm Always A V-Lignt And Will Listen To Vcha Sorry Girlset
They look fine don't get me wrong but another group only in English with zero brain lyrics and just shaking booty it's kinda boring and disgusting which way JYP and kpop in general is going for. The allure of kpop has always been very high quality singing and dancing with just enough showing skin to make it sexy now it's just even if they had skill only about show off your body for money 🫠
Am i the only one that misses the old Lexington, savanna,  Camila and Kendall. Not this over sexy version . It's like the are trying to copy katseye.  But katseye can tell when to show their true side
Katseye is the bestttr❤
Has the view numbers not gone up at all? Looks like it’s remained the same only 😮😢
Need need need need need MV OMG
Hi guys I posted a kpop game video and I hope you can take a look and tell me what you think. Thank you !! ♡💝♡
Maybe jyp should ‘spend some money on them spend some money on them’ and give them a proper mv
I don't know why JYP use this song to promote the group. I feel awkward.
JYP I know you know, you have 4 jewels in your hand... don't waste them... you already lost Kailee... don't lose any more... invest, they are VERY good... vocals, facial expressions, dancing... since Vcha, they are good, rare pearls... take good care of them... because they can be better than cat eyes =P
Esta canción está demasiado hp amoooooooo Demi devoró de una manera
ليه الناس ناقدين عليهم كذا ، رقصهم وأغانيهم حلوة 💖
Soo addictive
Katseye wannabe
slayyyyy
I am waiting their stage in music performance
😢
OHMYGODDDD
WHAT WONDERFUL VOICES!!!!!
A set? Are you serious JYP?
THEY ATE
Thank you, Camila, Lexi, Kendall, and Savana for your hard work.  Although all of the videos are low budget, we can all agree that GIRLSET killed this concept, choreography, and the vocals.  I'm also glad to know that we will be getting more songs with lyrics written by GIRLSET.   JYPE, Please invest more in GIRLSET's MV and promotions.  In fact, JYPE needs to learn how to market all of their artists like the way Stray Kids team is doing for Stray Kids.  The promotions period is very important to get fans excited and hyped up for an upcoming release work.
forever supporting GIRLSET
Love❤
Vcha/GIRLSET did NOT debut for a fuking 2:02 song bruh 💔
Крутые 🤩❤
I addicted so much
wth is this?
Girlset and jarseye will be so biggg🔥🔥🔥
UP GIRLSET 🆙🆙🆙✨
My new  favorite global group
It’s not allowed to be that short 😭😭
Am I the only one that thinks 2 minutes is to short for a song?
Brillen ❤❤❤❤
girl.. justice for these girlies i cannotttt 😭😭😭😭
i don’t think this is the official mv cuz it says it’s a choreography version
The first topic in the comments is that "users want a music video" like come on now jyp spend some money on girls
the way that the choreography version has more views than the actual mv like JYP spend more money on them because even the special video for it needs to be the real mv
Itzy vibes
It feels like I'm watching Girliscious
I hope jyp didn't screw it like last time😭
Lexie is like she just got upgraded, wth?? Looks, moves and specially voice wise she is so good!
Katseye?
PERO QUE SABROSA CANCION DIOS HECHO POR DIOS MISMO
❤❤❤
I might be weird for this, but I'm I the only one(pun intended). That thinks that Lexi kinda looks like Spencer from iCarly at 1:50 ??
queens
الأصوات واوو مواهبهم ماتستحقها جوايبي!!
they remind me of Miss A but their song are more eneegetic
WHY AM I ONLY FINDING OUT ABT THIS NOW
I can't wait for the GIRLSET's future!!! Love, love love!!
여아세트 렉시 카밀라 켄달 사바나 VIRGULES
i know the people that are hating are gonna be saying “i am a rich mannn” in a few days..!!
It's good, but the girls deserve more. The background looks cheap. (Ik it's real, Im talking about the products used in it.) and it's so small in there:(
Love this song!!!
Isn’t this just and itzy demo??!?!
periodt
Dancing and singing was great but I am not digging the lighter hair on Carmen and the chick with the curls. It just looks so unnatural! They’re all beautiful though and slay!!!
I’m glad that Girlset is back but I’m sad that KG and Kaylee is not with the group anymore, but I’m happy that they’re living their own lives away from JYP entertainment😢🥹🫶🏻
I’ve waited too many months. They’re too young for these looks 🫠
The way everyone was hating
노래는 좋은데
savana su voz 😮❤❤están Linda
Me gusta su concepto, pero JYP debería gastar más plata para las chicas.
렉시, 카밀라, 켄달, 사바나 반가워요 ! 정말 오래동안 기다렸어요 ! Girlset Fighting !
Flojo grupo, y no por las chicas que son buenas. Apuntan a una audiencia internacional... pero cantan en inglés y una chica lleva una parte con un "I Love NY".. pues a mí no me están atrayendo precisamente. Prefiero un grupo que cante en coreano, que se grabe en Corea del Sur (u otro país), y no me meta por obligación el "amo a estados hundidos". Auguro la disolución del grupo... otra vez.
A mi me hubiera gustado más una letra y concepto sobre superación de adversidades. Algo más sentimental.   Extraño VCha. Tal vez es lo que necesito para darle cierre y verlas ahora como Girl Set.   Solo se siente como si lo estuvieran evitando o se hubieran saltado esa etapa.
Yall 2:01 Lexi’s feet
再会楽しみにしてました！ 応援しています♪fromJAPAN
Hermosa canción 🔥
for jyp please use ads again for gen 5 agar MV jyp naik seperti dulu
for jyp please use ads again for gen 5 agar MV jyp naik seperti dulu
1:45 😮
"spend some money on me" but jyp be spending no money on them
My girls ate uppp they all so talented and so pretty😍
Can’t take my eyes of Kendall she really got better and is so frikn pretty
This is really good
702k
I NEED AN ACTUAL MUSIC VIDEO 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻
yesss she’s at a milll
1.7 mil !!! keep streaming all the vids guys
I love this song
Tried to mix this video with the official MV, if you're interested 👀
Dinero es lo que le falta a jyp o que? Porque siento que es muy tacaño con este grupo
I think I know why the audience didn’t connect with these outfits as much. It is bc these outfits look a bit costume-ish. The Special video had outfits that are more relatable and that the audience can connect with more. Outfits that ppl can easily re-recreate or get inspiration from.
Vamos chicas. Camila te amo ❤
I've seen a lot of comments in the last few days since the song came out that JYP isn't spending money on them but it is if you're not paying attention.... You don't have patience and you should because these girls worked hard to stay together not to get comments like this. Give them love and time
They are awesome I need them mv
Girlset
Omy ghad! I miss them, but I miss VCHA more😭 Im crying! How ever, I'm so happy for you girls!
Все комментарии на японском/китайском языке и исключительно, причём что песня мне вообще не понравилась так ещё и локация отстой, просто какой-то магазин, чё за фигня JYP?
Money on you gyus
SLAY GIRLS
GIRLSET
of course, i am ready to spend my money
How yall look different but songs still suck
This is Giselle’s era
I miss vcha.but finally they are back.I feel sorry for kg.she deserve a better ent.
1:31 PUT ME FIRST💜
Where is the mv 😭😭🙏🙏
This song is a banger, why is the video so poor?!
honestly, all of this looks disgusting. it was bad and stay bad. stability lol. scene presence was messy, their vocals was so annoying. lyrics hasn't any meaning... the budget is lower than floor...
걸셋❤
once here to support girlset
The Queens are back!!
RELEASE RELEASE RELEASE❤
This girls would definitely catch up with those other Foreign groups. JUST SPEND SOME MONEY ON THEM
not very Christ-like
GENIALES..
2M go go
❤❤
Lexi?arent u in VDH’s?
OMG CAMILA?
I’m obsessed…..like literally I think my family is tired of listen to this song 😅😅
infravaloradas están estas chicas 🔥
the huge contrast in their change form vcha to girlset is still crazy to me- they nailed it but yea these girls deserve more!!!! like they are literally asking you to "spend some money on me" in the song!!
❤️🖤✨️
jyp、スニーカーをトップスにするの好きすぎない？
I'm so fed up with international groups atp, GIVE US KPOP NOT INTERNATIONAL POP
休止中もサボらずに練習して努力し続けたのがよくわかる☺️
Jyp you should care about them this time I dare you if you did,nt and also take it as a request not a threat🔪
No one can take out my impression the red hair girl look like asian Anitta
Like it❤
잘하네요
Me encanto
ok but can people pls stop saying that jyp needs to spend more money on them. this is their first video, and we saw what happened with vcha, so jyp is just prob seeing if they’re a hit or not. and if u look at other groups first videos, they’re not that great either. the costumes in this vid are great btw. and pls im not like a hater but it was kinda pmo seeing all the comments that jyp needs to spend more money
They were children not too long ago. So tired of pop girlies being sexualized as a rebrand smh
Está bonita la canción
케이팝 아니고 팝송이네
Ok I just got here but this is so good!!!!! AND THE ENERGYYYYY????
노래가 너무 좋네요
if you're looking for a commas dance in public  cover here it is https://youtu.be/ZwNroVOBjYo?si=c5sZ6HBttSZx0iPJ it's really nice ❤
I LOVEE YOU GIRLSET I ADORE AND ADMIRE YOU ❤
we need the actuly MV
1.6 mil!!!
song of the year!!
IMAGINE my nxt video on shuffle is a2k mission kg savanna kaylee my bias kayleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Hold on, aren't they the girls from VCHA????
Definitely some Thriller influence here!
꿈을 위해 인내한 아티스트들, 대성하기 바랍니다.
おかえりー！！これからの活躍楽しみにしてるよ❤
choreo is fire but the camera angle sucks
STOPPP THIS LOOKS TEWWW GOOD
The adlibs at the end really pop now that I've listened to this over 100 times 😅
Wether there's a proper MV to this u can't deny the song is lit.
JYP better not sabotage these girls... again.
Why I see Little Mix in them 😍
gurlll fan from the start bruhhh
1:44 LEXI’S PART IS SO FRELAING ADDICTIVE
sLAYYYYY

❤❤
Waaaa changed the name and style ! Cool ! 🎉
Let's go 2M
MVより先にダンスバージョンを出したら駄目だし、しかもMVと何も変わりない映像で戸惑ってる。
After Katseye I had a very bad opinion of occidental girl bands, this changed my mind. Seriously. MV PLEASE
YEAHHH
She is singing live or not? If it is singing live she is much more better than most of kpop star... 😂😂😂 Ppl these days only care about face and forget that one of idol job is singing stable while dancing
最高！！！！♡
Okay but this actually ate hope they had an actual MV
LO MEJOR QUE VI EN MI VIDAAAAA
우와 ㄷㄷ 인기 엄청 많아지겠다
Ya salio el MV
흠 대략 망할듯...

Pessoal agora tem um MV vamos lá ver

ATE IT GIRLSSS AND LEFT NO CRUMB
I thought it’ll be an actual mv
ILL STAY FOREVER, and ILL STAY HERE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
JYP please invest in Girlset! We don't need antoher Katseye but please invest in Girlset. They really have their own flare!
JYP are you not embarrassed 😳 😳...like are you broke or just dont care about this group ?
Он шикарен ❤❤❤ Спасибо Вам 😊😊😊
I can confirm this is the best and most wholesome mv I’ve ever watched
Oh yeah ❤❤🎉🎉😊😊😊😎😎🖥️

Is this the mv? So cheap! The girls look cheap! Specially lexus look like soooo normal ? Jyp cammon is that all you got!? Hayyyys they need kg they looks like nothing without kg...
I don’t deserve their love because of what’s happening in the fandom because of all of these toxic stays and Bangchan is mad at those toxic stays and I’m sure he’s mad at the real stays but still he made this video for us . I don’t deserve their love because of this . I LOVE YOU ALL FOREVER AND EVER AND I WILL STAY WITH YOU’LL FOREVER I WILL NOT FORGET YALL . YOU PEOPLE MADE MY LIFE SO SPECIAL I WAS ASTRAY LITTKE TEENAGE AND AFTER BANGCHAN FOUND ME HE MADE MY LIFE BETTER AND THANK YOU STRAYKIDS FOR MAKING MY LIFE BETTER DONT LEAVE ME PLEASE
Commas...
Omgg JYPE better promote them better this time!🫶🏼⭐
Tami me encantaaaaa❤ eres muy talentosa✨🔥🫶
I am not who's crying it you who is 😭😭
this redebut actualy ate tf down like everyones sleeping on it yk damn well if another group released this song it would be hyped UPPPPPP
JYP Entertaiment, really? i need an actual M/V 😭
This song is so incredible than vchas' debut
Why can’t I found the song on Spotify and is this a single or what
Who is the main visual?
I still remember vcha stans r so mean to katseye called them flops when they released debut mv now katseye is popular now where r those vcha stans can't even stan those favs ??
Their voices are very bad, you won't become Kateye😽
Before this banger we had Y.O universe❤
応援してるよ🥹
LETS HIT 2M VIEWS!!!!
LETS REACH 2M SOON❤❤
ずっと待ってたよー！日本から応援してる🎌💕みんな最高に魅力的！！
You guys may change everything about urself but we’re never going to forget about vcha
Safe start but we need the full MV, Girlset deserves one ASAP
Little Mix is that you?
Can't surpass Katseye
Commas like this?    ,   ,   , 😅
JYP YOU HAVE TO PROMOTE THEM!!
omggg they ate but JYP give this a better promotion cause this doesnt look likea MV at all
the best to the year
Keep on givin ghooorl!! ❤
Flop😊
It's actually good they need more support
I wish this song wasn't spoiled so much on social media.. especially that the song was so short. A few snippets could've been fine but I feel like some people are sick of hearing the chorus already before the song was even dropped 😭
This is soo good😍😍
We're going for 2M views.
1,416m
بكون اول فان لهمم🔥+ يستحقو MV كامل يجنننن💗💞🎀
love u KENDALL
Вау. Почему эта песня не звучит из каждого чайника? Она же прекрасна!
One of th lowest budget videos ever. Only one area.
Just Choreography???? We need a mini album
a random closet and a dream
we waited weeks just for this??? i love the choreography but the mv isn't giving 🤦🏻‍♀️
After vcha was gone, all of us were sad but now there is girlset and their comeback! jyp pls make mv for this this is TOO GOOD!!!!! 🙏🙏
Song is good but this is not the only music video is it? Who is running jype? What a mess😅
Ga jelas bgt JYP.  Prerelease dibikin bnyak spoiler seolah bakal niat MV nya ditambah lama hiatus pas release kok gini amat kek gak niat buang2 budget
WOAHH new debut?
OG GLOBALL GIRLGROUPPP. GIRLSET X KATSEYE WHENN
OH THEY ARE MADDD!! GOO GIRLSET
노래..별로네 :/ 실제 뮤비 어디야
WHAT THE???? this is the best
The girls look and sound great, but come on JYP. This sounds like a song they rejected for Itzy 4 years ago. And the music video. Come on. We want these girls to succeed. We're ready to be hyped. Please just give them something decent to work with!
Global groups just should stop…
Was the budget 65 bucks  😭 .
❤❤❤
WERE THE OGS!
JYP OUGHT TO MAKE THE MOR GOOD MV  TO PROMOTE THIS SONG.
This is giving me little mix vibes.. LOVE IT
Changbin's voice and rap style suit the song very well. The song made me addicted. The different rap style suits his voice very well, Changbin boss💙🤍💙
awesome...
Parabéns  lindas sucesso 💘 💘 💘 💘  🎼
DON’T MAKE THIS GO INTO WASTE JYP.
you keep looking at me looking at me👀
so addictiveeeeee
Where is the mv ? I saw the teaser but mv ?
JYP LISTEN PLZ WE NEED MV😭😭😭😭😭
I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE I LOVEEE
JYP buat mereka menjadi super star seperti senior nya di JYP  Beri dukungan dan promosi yang baik buat mereka
Vchaaaa
Vcha
Vchaaaaaa
아무리 봐도 좋은데 정식 MV좀 만들어줘 아까워
these girls deserve much more
JYP, it's time to spend some money on them. this girls have so much potential, don't let them die!
Me encanta 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
海外ガール全開のリトルミックスみたいな存在になれるように願ってるー！！！
노래 넘 좋은데 ㅎㅎ
Now how you gunna drop Choreography before the real video 😢
not a fan of the choreo, styling or the song. the girls have talent, but this isn't right for them. everything about it looks cheap. bet you won't see this in highly regarded groups, so it's not ok for girlset to get this kind of... thing.
Only 2 minutes?? Is it an intro or smth?
first of all, the video says choreography version so ofc its not going to be a flashy mv lol 😭😭
Espero si hatean la canción los propios fans le hagan propaganda, jyp no le han dado a otros grupos antes y debemos esforzarnos en hacer sonar la canción en otras apps
This song is so good but wheres the MV, I love how in the song they say "SPEND SOME MONEY ON ME" Jyp did the opposite
I admit the chorus is catchy, but Unfortunately for the girls, it's in a bad way. Like it's giving "Baby Shark" levels of irritation.  🦈
It's like JYP is tanking this group on purpose, I don't get it! He knows this isn't gonna compete with Katseye on any level, he didn't even give them a music video?? The dance is like nothing, the song is literally 2 minutes. I don't get this, these girls deserved the world. They'll be done before they even have a chance, I'm so sorry to vcha 😔
Who's the brown haired girl ? I'm new ,sorry !
Jyp dont be cheap on the girls man, they deserve more than this
I just loved this song 😭💗
POR QUE LE QUITARON SUS RIZOSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
ES SUPER BUENA Y ADICTIVAA AMEE💗💗
Let’s gooo
Lexus and Savanna 1:47 what?!?!! ❤️‍🔥🔥
The Lexus part 0:54 my god ❤
I'm dying with the girls' new look, they look so beautiful ❤️‍🔥😩
please do a GRL cover of ugly heart
De verdad esto es su mv oficial?
부침이 있었으나 잘 넘겼으니 됐고... 이제 jyp가 홍보 좀 잘 해주자... 왜 이렇게 소극적인거야..
All These fine ass asians are buying up all The good beats 😒
I missed you girls!
Isso tá muito bom 😍😍😍❤❤
Tami amaría que me mandaras saludos esta hermosa tu canción felicidades ❤fan desde antes de tu debut💖
I am SO here for a mature rebrand
We need mv not choreografy !!!
I mean I love it for her , but wasn’t the song too short or is there more to it ? In the album pls
Gosh this is actually REALLY goooood!!!
ok????
NGL, this song is getting better over time.  The Horrible sound during the live interview just killed it for me for a few days.
Esperamos tanto para esto..?
JYP stop making kidz bop music! Get with the times!
¿Por qué laciaron a Savanna?
Eughhhh
omg i miss VCHA
一人ひとりがソロで活躍できそうな位、 ハイスペック
Chan❤what the bleep are you doing to me?!😍
４人それぞれの個性あるパワーを感じられるパフォーマンスでめっちゃカッコいい！ ４人のこれからの活動を楽しみにしてます💖もっと色々見たい!! 日本から応援してます💓
they deserve a better budget after what they've been through...
Idc if it doesnt have an mv this is amazing
que hicieron en el cabello de savanahh y donde esta nuestra kaylee y kg??
THEYRE WORTH THE FUNDING PLS GIVE THEM A BIGGER BUDGET, BETTER PROMOTION
This song was promoted a WHOLE month and then they just show us the girl dancing on a dressing room?! The girl actually deserve better and the fans deserve a better MV
Bro why she changed the ending it was so iconic bro what the hell🤬🤬🤣
Kendall’s expressions remind me of KG’s
es irónico que la canción diga “spend some money on me”y que se haya grabado en un solo lugar
es irónico que la canción diga “spend some money on me”y que se haya grabado en un solo lugar
THIS IS SO GOOD OMG IM SCREAMING
¡GUAU! ¡ESTOY EN SHOCK! ¡LA NUEVA BANDA ES GENIAL, ESPECIALMENTE LA CANCIÓN! ¡SIGUE ASÍ!
Is this a safe space to say that Girlset is one of the best western group debuts? I think they’re my favorite right now. They’re all such crazy, good performers and the song is hot. Those vocals?! No one slacks, honey 💅 Camilla especially gags me. But the best part is they have a group synergy, which is why they feel so good to watch together and I think successful groups should have the same sort of energy when they’re together. Synergy like H2H or NewJeans. Their visual and energetic harmony on stage is crazy.   Anyway, I can’t wait for the rest of the world to get to know Girlset 💘💘💘
Estoy en todos los vídeos de GRILSET 🫦 menos en mi casa jajajaja
All of you crying about not getting an official music video are so incredibly entitled and greedy. You wait this long for them and you would think you all would be just happy that they’re back, but you also have so much negative shit to say. So annoying.   I personally love this choreography version because it gave us a total view of who they were as performers without all of these fancy fancy productions . It showed us they could hold their own and they ate.
OMG this choreography so perfect
وات حتى جيوايبي عمل هيك فرق 🙄
Katseye is Better
This is so bad it hurts. Why would my mix have this oh my goodness 😢
2 minutes😢😅what
Sorry but this has nothing to do with kpop anymore. Westernized fits, and english lyrics no korean .
GIRLSET so talented! I can tell they worked really hard!
I don't find any of them appealing at all. I only find the one in the red skirt pretty, but I see no star factor in anyone.
Where is the other members? I want them to become the old vcha again 😢
😊😊😊😊
Love itttttt I never knew this was her singing style!
is this vcha?
Stay healty guys
I think bro released the wrong version but this is so good omg
The budget the song 10s
❤
Are we just forgetting about Vcha? I’m confused af loll. Their amazing but instead of dealing with that controversy we just keeping adding new groups? I really am confused😂
Okayyy this a bop
The production is of cheap level very poor, the song is very good JYPE didn't invested on them anything even nugu productions are better than this 😒😒 didn't they promised about Commas MV? I don't think we are getting any 😬😑
mid
por que me le alisas el pelo a la niñaaa!!! bro nooooooo dejala al naturalll
ARE GIRLSET
For me they will continue to be VCHA, it doesn't matter if they are GIRLSET and it doesn't matter if it's Savana, Kendall, Lexi, Camila, those girls who appeared in Only One, You Universe, Ready for You Getter, Call Me
uy
Its giving shein. Its giving a 100 dollars and a dream. Its giving CHEAP
Este estilo definitivamente les sienta mejor a ellas, felicidades por regresar y espero consigan mucho apoyo
who even ask choreography version??💀poor my girls jype usa treat them like trash
YOU GUYS ATE DOWNNN
1.3 mil WOOHOO
I hope this is just a preview, and that JYP will give the girls an MV for both this song and a new debut song.
HMOOB GIRL!!!
This is just sad such talented girls singing ina dressing room
Amooooo
The fact there is no MV for this is criminal
Que buena cancióm
Omg
努力的人應該要被世界看見~應該好好地拍攝MV投資旗下藝人~
wooo~ GIRLSET so pretty and talented!
vocal sooo good
Kendall❤
As an BTS fan I love this group
Omg it is so adictive✨🎼
Omg Kendall
Little mix meets itzy meets katseye. Liking the transformation so far❤🎉
달았다. 그래… 왜 그렇게 잘해 우리 아덴이 만히 고생했어 🥺 꼭 다시 만나보자
Oooohh my girls❗😍
We need kg and kaylee 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 JYP your really bad to vcha
Amo el vídeo la música el baile los vestuarios todo en general
❤🖤
❤
Girlset ❤🖤❤🖤
メルヘンチックでとってもかわいい😊
this is my new fav song
OMGGG I LOVE IT!!
I think they will replace kiss of life
I think they will replace kiss of life
Since my bias left Vcha… My bias wrecker Kendall steps into that position
Not
How we doing on charts, please update
‘Spend some money on me’ YES JYP SPEND MONEY ON THEM I DEMAND AN MV!!
They are trying to act like kasteye 😂
Still trending in the USA. You girls are doing so well!
Gracias diosito
Slay queen❤
Why is this song called commas? Makes no sense
This softer vibe fits out Binnie so well! 🥰 he really is such a versatile artist and lyricist ♥️
mhm mhm gimmie 14 of em
그들이 얼마나 아름답게 노래하는지 (저는 라틴 아메리카 출신이고 통역을 사용하고 있습니다)
Wooow so cooool
Woooooow so cooool 🤩🤩🤩
Nutra querida Tami se lo propuso y lo consiguió! Estoy llena de felicidad por ella, deseo que tenga mucha buena suerte ! 🤍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Asahi’s voice improved a lot. I mean even before he has a veeeeerrrryyy nice voice but now he gained more confidence 🥰 I love you Trejor! 💙
pleaseee react to ATEEZ! <3
Love their new style!
This I is so good like haters gonna hate❤❤
THIS SONG ATE SO HARD WHAT 😧!! I really enjoyed BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SO SHORT 😭I really love their concept right now and the direction they're going with the music 💗
THEY'RE FINALLY BACK 💗!! I just hope these girls are healthy and happy in what they do. ATE !!
Glad to see VCHA get a 2nd chance with a much needed rebranding 💞
わがままそうな子たちが抜けて、 バランスがよくなったと思う❤ この4人でかっこよく決めてほしい！
Song is wayy too short imo but I'm loving this concept for them! It really reminds me of classic little mix
コンセプトが4人に合ってる！！たくさんの人に聴いてほしい！！
So little mix coded and im loving it , hoping for jype to promote the girls better
This was so fun and cute and fun and I love Treasure ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Change the song.Thereis nothing fun about the song.The girls are talented and gorgeous but you gave them shitty songs.Take Lil Mix, Spice girls,fifth harmony and Blackpink for e.g. They have actual fun songs
So cool😍😍😍
They were better off disintegrating than debuting again hoping to become as popular as KATSEYE imho. This song sounds really bad sorry
So cheap jyp. Girlset deserves better
As a straykidsfab, I originally came to support changbin, but JUN.K's vocals are PERFECTION 😍
わー！！！戻ってきてた！！やっとだ〜嬉しい😌🤍
GIRLSET let's go
Well...they have 5 dollars.
I'm going crazy over this, I keep repeating it... 😭😭💋💋🫦🫦
良曲！！
This song is actually so good so why isn’t there a real MV??
最後のコーラスが最高！！！！ こりゃもうリピート確実ですね💕︎ あと、俳優さんのチョイスがなんとも…🤦‍♀️💓
最後のコーラスが最高！！！！ こりゃもうリピート確実ですね💕︎ あと、俳優さんのチョイスがなんとも…🤦‍♀️💓
What happened to Vcha?
❤❤
good song but we want full MV not PV Like This
マッサマンしぬwwwww
1:44 listen jyp neow.
2 mins song?
待ってたよｰ!!!!!!!!みんなが休んでる間にもたくさん努力してきたことがダンスと歌声からビシビシ伝わります！！！どうか世界へ羽ばたけ！！
Let’s go I’m looking forward to more from them.
Stream commas omg
Wth! camilla lexi kendall savanna❤❤❤❤
LEXI IS DEFINITELY MY BIAS
I am here since a2k so u can say I have been through the roller coaster of emotions
This is honestly embarrassing coming from a multi-millionaire company that’s known for producing some of the most popular groups in K-pop. Everything about this comeback feels cheap and outdated. The song and lyrics don’t make sense, and there’s nothing unique or true to the girls’ identity. The styling doesn’t help either it’s giving 2018 K-pop at best. I genuinely feel bad for the members, because they clearly have so much more to offer, yet their company keeps failing to recognize that. At this point, it’s obvious JYP doesn’t care about building them into a successful group. I truly hope the girls eventually get the recognition and success they deserve, instead of being held back and mistreated by their own company.
Lexi with her red shoes and the red carpet is like...wait! Where are her legs??? 😂
Adeeek
Mr.J Always ruin the G-groups now 😮‍💨
modern time slaves. So sad they are stuck doing this
TREASUREはどんな曲も自分たちのものにする力があるね！！本当に誇らしいよ> < ♡
Let's go for the 5M
1,245m
貴女達が　必ず戻って来ると信じていました😂🎉 「輝け❤」
This is an insane comeback 100000/10
Slayy queens <3
This choreo ate
I'm very happy but It's too short😭😭😭
Amazing ❤
I was excited for this group , but jyp looks like he is not putting any effort in investing on this group , so sadly jyp failed once again
Love it!! 🩷🩷🩷
Jyp rented the clothes and but them into a tiny room.   Gave them a song that still sounds like kids bop. Like seriously what is the whole point of dressing them differently if it is not gonna reflect in their song. The chorus is just awful. The high  note was the only high light.  This rebrand was just not good and not well planned. This is really a waste of the girls potential
OH WISHLINGS YOU NEVER MISS
OMW THE MV THE RAP AND THE VOCALS THW VISUALS JUST ATE ❤
I LOVE YOU
can someone tell me why they don't have MV?
Yesssssss 💗💗💗💗💋💋💋
Ahora si suenan mucho mejor
they flopped not because they are not talented. It's bcuz of the looks im sorryyy
the dance.. omg we r so back
Es ella, es ellaaaaaa 🍓🍓🍓
This song feels lacking but it's good yet it's short...
I think GIRLSET will achieve more if JYP will spend more for them. NGL, theyre all good!
“choreography version” THAT IMPLIES THERE IS A REGULAR MV VERSION IF THERE ISNT I WILL GO TO THE JYP BUILDING AND FIGHT
"Choreography Version" but 80% of the video is shaky close up shots. Please spend some money on a better videographer JYPE!!
el visual de kendall con cabello rubio es de otro nivel 🧘🏻💖
Ezerela pls join prelude
this is NOT a song LMFAOOO. 2 MINUTES?💀
These are actually the girls from VCHA?!? You gotta be kidding me!
Short and beautiful
Müzik videosu beklıyordum bu kadar bekledıkten sonra bu olması üzdü ama ne olursa olsun onları desteklıycem go gırl
All the teasing for a month, just for 2 minutes?
Why they just four andd... Change name? Where is the real Vcha😢
finally
🥑🍓
ダンスも歌も皆んなのビジュも大好き過ぎて発表から毎日ループで聴いてます。 上半身を回す振り付けがカッコいい🎉😮 しなやかなインナーマッスルがないと首を痛めるしリズミカルに踊るの難しい。 同い年のグループで切磋琢磨する姿をこれからも見守りたいです。 本当に素敵で魅力的💓私も一緒に踊りたい😂
0:42 The way. That Lexi. Drops???? SHE TELEPORTED 😨 holy molyy And the way she dances at 1:45 is so insanely satisfying - she's really bias wrecking me right now 😭🥹
I loved it, without a doubt the 4 of them will go far, much success to my girls, Camila, Lexi, Kendall and Savanna! I understand that all of this is a new strategy and I love it, I can't wait to see what they're going to bring us! As Kendall said, Commas is a transition song and if there's no MV, don't complain, remember that the SD girls are coming with more things. I feel that Commas was like the pre-debut, a preview of what's to come.
:<I bet this song was for NEW JEANS
Amoooo
I make video Girlset - COMMAS extended version. Hope you like it❤❤ https://youtu.be/dlPx3fi9R1g?si=Q7nXGqCic6Qn67Kx
Ooo
I think this is only the choreography. Maybe there will be an actual MV later I pray 😭❤️. Cause the song is too good ❤️❤️
We waited so long just for it to be buns. The dance is good but the beat sounds like TikTok music, the voices are amazing but the lyrics are shitty.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Another set of young girls for jyp to abuse....
Me encanta este nuevo concepto
Girls, you ate with this one!!!
ソロって、あー、チェヨンはこういう世界観が好きなんだ、やりたいんだ、っていうのがわかっていいですね。独特の雰囲気。
Guys they are brutal on tiktok but the song ain't even bad what I like it
Joder la parte de Felix 😮
This is kendall's era for me
SO where's the MV???
who are they?
I love the girls❤ I just wish they had chosen other colors for them 🥺
Honestly, I expected more from JYP because I know they can fucking do it from years past, but I don’t know why I trusted them. They definitely do not treat their international groups very well at all, and they get treated worse than the others in my opinion. It’s a shame really because they definitely have talent, but JYP is just squandering it right now. The song is fine, I guess, but there’s nothing much to it, and the choreography is good, but the costumes seem really out of place in a dressing room. I’m not mad at the group at all, just their fucking company label they’re sadly under. 😢
❤❤❤
Kendall ate this up
Ufffff rolon
the girls ate so badly, i been streaming  this everyday, but u y'all we need more help (just in case)   there is multiples reasons, why it's just official video (Choreo)  1) it could be for market reasons or they also pro being smart  2) this video pro for us to be busy, for album or other things to see  3) get every fandom to watch this video!!
Hola de nuevo ❤❤
we need subtitles & live shows 😭😭
DAMMN, at first i was hesitant but as I listen to it more I must say IT IS SO CATCHY AND GOOD. Idc what they say but they served, ate, the whole plate with this concept 🫦🗣
Gopay
1.2 MIL GUYS
TELL EMM!!!!
200k !!!
Some kpop dance cover group make better MV than this, smh.
Savanna's vocal has improved a lot.   Wish they gave Lexi more lines 🥲
Jype where tf is the mv
Again, JYfcukingPE sucking at promoting his artists
chills!!!
Still trending in the US.. currently at 28
Louve Samara! Louve lexie! Louve Emily!
They look stunning and sound amazing! They are already so talented, but their improvement and professionalism have grown!
솔직히 팀 정비한게 훨~~~~씬 낫다... 전에는 안 어울리는 옷을 입은 것 같았고...4명이 훨씬 좋네...기대됨
자막 좀 붙여줘라아아아아
Here before its famous!
i swear i watched this like a month ago
0:20 love this part
Choreography actually ate omggg. Also I have to add, their makeup and outfit and just the entire concept suits them SO much. Their makeup during Vcha was NOT it with the bright bold red lips in contrast to the simple makeup. Face cards are absolutely LETHAL here
Jype spent maybe one comma tops on this
0:45 kendall’s part is my fav omg
WTF Q PERFECTA 😭😭💞💞💞💞💞💞🍎🍎🍎🍎
I think the reason why jyp didn’t want to make an MV for commas is because he was scared that people would still be mad about the whole vcha thing and he didn’t want to waste thousands and even millions on an actual MV because he might’ve thought we would boycott the group. (Just a thought)
Love their fit , song and their vocals are fire 💋❤️‍🔥🔥
Tomaron de inspiración a Katseye? Por que lo arruinas JYP? A mi me gustaba el concepto de VCHA no ésto, que le haya funcionado a Katseye no significa que te vaya a funcionar a ti, pobres chavas
The song is great, JYPE PLEASE upgrade your promoting. You do so well for skz, PLEASE DO THE SAME FOR GIRLSET. They deserve it.
The beat reminds me of ITZY Dalla dancebreak. Ready, GIRL SET, Go!! 🔥🔥🔥
This is like a 2025 Björk I love it 😮‍💨
ES muy bueno y pegajoso
새로워진 GIRLSET 응원할게요!!!!
Lyrics: 🤑 💎 💰 💵 💸 💰  MV: 🪙 🪙
Hate from india
Lexi barely got a solo singing part in this song 🤔
Has the cameramen never framed choreography before or did the editors crop the video…
THIS SONG SO GOOD. PLEASE JYPE PROMOTION THIS GROUP BETTER
Okeyy girls ❤❤
Jyp? How about the promotion of girlset? Why does we didn't feel nor see it?
They have really grown up! Awesome to see so many Japanese comments here! 🙏💟💜
Me gusta como suena, pero quiero el mv
Perfect 🥹
oh wow
i’m so confused
love you music chaeyoung
I just realized they are some of the members from vcha but what happened to the other two girls
日本から応援してます！！！どうか彼女たちが心機一転、全世界へ羽ばたいていけますように！！！！
Arte
Where is the MV ????????
26 en el ranking de tendencias 🔥 VAMOS GIRLSET
I'm like commas.👌🏽
The bridge reminded me of Lady Gaga’s Born this way I love this song even more now omgg
Please make this not only reach kpop audiences👉🏽👈🏽
omg anitta
this shows that JYP papi can also be wrong, we all laughed at vcha name
miss vcha
Im iffy on the song. I liked parts of it but the high notes with Kendall are flat and lifeless it felt like it was out of place for the song, when she's in her natural tone her voice is great but I hope next time they'll be more mindful of that.
ALL BADDIESS, WE LOVE GIRLSET🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Welcome back Camila, Kendall, Lexi and Savanna!!!!!
1:46 i wonder just how the dance break will be when the original cheography is like this already.
Yo wait Savannah is giving major Ryujin vibesss
DID JYP DISBAMNDED VCHA
SLAYAGE!!
LMAO YOU ARE SO FUNNY SABBBY!
Great song... Though maybe JYP's legal team spent the MV money.
I'm still waiting for the MV. I support the girls, but they need more production in their videos because their voice and dance style are phenomenal.
Voltando aqui pela milésima vez
Jyp is so cheap they reused the intro from ceremony, this is recycled scraps
Loveeeee thissss
I'm confused...There's no MV??
Don't some of them look like some of the girls from vcha
they aren't little babies anymore, they are looking FIREEEEE! i love it!
oMG I LOVE IT
EU TO ESPEAVA DSD DO VCHA JUNTO DO TWICE NO BRASIL😭😭😭
La canción es muy buena!!!!! es cuestion de tiempo go go go Girlset
i am LIVING for this rebrand, this is fantastic!!!!!!!!
❤I need more of them please and I need mv

Ellas Tienen el talento que les falta a las Katseye cantan muy bonito más promoción jyp
Now THIS is how you release a short song. We got 2 verses, 2 pre choruses, 3 choruses, AND a bridge. Plus, my girls actually got so show they can sing cus they can SANG. So proud of them, and hoping this is just the start of a busy career for them!
Why the video and camera work looks like a cheap production, omg JYPE is so hard for you do something good for them?
Mmmm migajas 🤌🏻
What the 😻
eehh its not for me i wanted a pluggnb r&b sza vibe
Hello Salomé, le vlog que j’attend chaque semaine 😄 D’expérience, je te conseillerai d’ouvrir pour checker l’état des meubles qui restent en carton … J’avais acheté bcp de meubles à l’avance quand j’ai pris mon indépendance et j’ai eu quelques surprises et pas possible d’échanger ou se faire rembourser car le délais était dépassé 🥲
JYP WE NEED AN MV

muy lindas pero para que pase lo mismo con Vcha mejor no apoyemos estos tipos de proyectos de jyp
They lack charisma. Pass.
Wow love these girls but where the mv at
0:29 está parte es jodidamente adictiva
This is so good!
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEIR REBRAND THEN YOU CAN GET OUT
GUYS LETS JUST SUPPORT GIRLSET ON THEIR REBRAND
Omgg
JYP What happened to the MV?
PUTA QUE PARIU QUE MUSICASSO, UM CRIME ISSO AI NAO TER COREOGRAFIA
0:43 LEXI'S FLEXIBILITY AND DANCE SKILLS?! HELLO?
No one is going to talk about how terrible the plastic surgery and lip filler look on Savanna and Camila? Okay, guess we're gonna gloss over  because kpop fans don't know how to give an honest opinion...
HATERS GONNA HATEEEEE YAAAAASSSS
AMEI
ARRASOU MEU AMOR
VCHA to GIRLSET
WE NEED MV JYP ‼️‼️
Que
me alegro mucho de que hallan vuelto y con un concepto totalmente nuevo yo sé que van a logran el exito en poco tiempo, ojala JYP ahora si se preocupe por las chicas
i love this for them but can the camera man back up a little
Yada yada noise cancellation
"Tu hazlo yo paso, todo ese " bla bla bla" me da asco. Temazooooo❤❤
what the heck i've been waiting for a whole month just for this????? , where is the mv ?
1.1 mil keep streaming guys!!!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤
yes these  girls are  back
their  from vhca . omg
1M en hora buena
Jyp take yo own advice and spend some money on this queens cause wdym they gon dance in a dressing room with those glorious fits🤨✋
Es todo lo que esperaba de chaeyoung 💞💞💞
Wait isn’t this vcha or am I tweaking?! Cause OMGGG❤I barley even recognized them
what in the itzy
ILLOVE
1 MILLION VIEWS Y'ALL   2 MILLION GIRLSET CAN'T WAIT FOR LITTLE MISS YOU DESERVE THE WORLD  EDIT: TEXTY WITH MY BESTIE IN THE GROUP CHAT IS HE FEASABLE   LITTLE MISS HAS 3 MILLION VEIWS
This is what y'all waited for 17 months? Damm the bar is low
They DEVOURED THIS UP!!! This is a REALLY good way to market a business!!!    The moment I saw this when it came out, I IMMEDIATELY watched it!!! American Eagle needs to take notes!!
OMG THE VOCALS LUV IT
Tan linda mi chae nonon la amo 😭😭💞
Respectfully y‘all shouldn’t embarrass these poor girls even more. Why is this giving NUGU from one of the big 3? Let’s actually be sincere about this rebrand and put the fonds where they belong.
What in the ITZY reject is even going on?
I‘m simply asking: shouldn’t a choreography version not actually show the choreography?
I kinda liked the song but it’s too short and just 2 min???? Well that’s frustrating actually,I love the girls from the bottom of my heart I just wish jyp would take them more seriously,love girlset❤️❤️
OMGG WHY THIS IS SO GOOD😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i genuinely hope they’re being treated good. jyp you will pay
With all do respect, JYP is doing this whole GGG wrong. First he choose people who are not ready for the pressure of the industry, which is why Kaylee and KG left. This rebranding is so inappropriate for people their age. The skimpy outfits do not fit this group. Jpy needs to rebrand themselves. They need to see what worked for stray kids and twice and expand on that. Just my opinion
where's the MV? nani?  why put a teaser as if there's going to be one if theres not?
Girls too talented to have this much poor management, bro imagine smth as simple as making the lighting in the room warmer and color coded the video better, smth as simple could’ve saved this, but no, absolutely no effort, GIVE THE GIRLS, ITZY “GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS” level budget, we know u have money jyp.
Our stunning girls ATE DOWN. They're all super beautiful. Didn't even realize it was them from the thumbnail like the more mature change was the right direction. Also Kendall with blonde hair is pretty asf 💗
Don't get me wrong, commas is good, but jyp I'm sure you can spend a few more dollars on them, it won't hurt😭
Spend some money on them!!!????NOW
Jype put literally no effort the song isn't that great and there's no MV to talk of, jype I hope you stop debuting girl groups if you can't even take proper care of them
Que lindas se ven 😭💕
JYP listen, they need more money spent on them 😭
These girls should look into another company maybe hype and geffen sense they seems to handle these kinda of groups
Good job girls!! I really hope y’all are healthy and happy!!💋🥺
Here are the ONCES!!  We love you Chaeyoung❤
The VOCALS 🫦
OH WOAAAAA. I LOVE THAT. WE NEED MORE SONG JYPAPI. 😍
Here AGAIN so good
Fan desde vcha💗💕
Wow JYPE your advertisement is incredible! I didn't even know this video came out! Do better
WOOO GIRLSET
OMG THEYRE BACK!?? I love them sm
Let's create a trend with this amazing song!!! Who agrees???
LET'S GO TO 2M VIEWS FOR GIRLSET 🔥
Chicos no hay que dejar de apoyar a las chicas, GIRLSET LOVE U
now they are so sexy they can rival Katseye and aespa and every group and i hope they reach the top😍🔥🔥🔥
the chaeyoung vibe is so obvious. I like it!!!
THIS ATE
We need mv 😢😢😢😢😢
𝘓𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘪𝘵
Cami is giving main diva for sure but are we surprised??? Savanna sounds incredible! The improvement in her vocals is insane she just got natural talent! I thought she was Cami a couple times! Lexi honestly to me is the main visual she looks so good and does amazing dancing! Kendall is doing good!
Girlset deserves better!
This is great. MV where?!
😢😢 i come here everyday to watch the actual MV
STREAM🎉
Chaeyoung is amazing as a solo artist and as a group, this girl is just talented! That's why it's my bias💗
I can’t wait for more guys lesgooooo
Lesgoooooooo
This sounds like an ITZY song
It’s giving Like That by psy
Ayra star…copyright…
HATERS GONNA HATE YEAH
We need a real MV tho 😭
AAAAA TE AMO AMOR MIO TE VES HERMOSA TE AMO DEMASIADO ESTOY SUPER ORGULLOSA DE TI ME ENCATA COMO LOGRAS TUS METAS TE AMO TAMTO MI MI NIÑA HERMOSA PRECIOSA MI AMOR ERES TAN ESPECIAL PARA MI MI BEBE LINDA TE AMO AMOECITO MI CHAEYOSITA LINDA TE TANTO QUE ESTIY LLORANDO POE TI GRIT  REEE Y LLORE
Wheres the mv?!?!
wait actually banging, good vibes
Woooow, I LOVE YOU CHAEYOUNG
I really like the song but I wish JYPE invested more in them. An actual music video, music show appearances, etc
Okay let’s discuss about when they will officially comeback in Korean Music TV shows rather than talking about the shitty settings cuz I can’t wait them to comeback in Korea❤
OMGG I LOVE IT
Jyp needs to understand that if they he wants them to be successful he needs to at least give them a proper mv
Eyekons here to support them
MVは出ないのかな？
Literally a million views in 2 days. That too without an actual MV. Do you see this potential,JYPE?
Exactly what I needed
DIOS MIO ESTÁ CANCIÓN ES ARTE PURO😼🙌🔥
At least they could give them a better set and back dancers . I like the song but where is the MV
I really think starship should consider hiring new choreographers that produce dance steps that match Ives energy , or consider giving members time to practice properly , it lacks so much energy. They look good but please some good chores ❤ They had some good performances with love dive and I am best eras dance wise
My conclusion : jyp is just bad at making song (or probably it's just my expectation that's too high)  Even if i compare this song with gnarly (that has questionable lyrics) this song still sounds worse
MV PLEASE
iconic 😙
This choreography isn't cute or sexy, It's just downright distasteful. 👎 Try again people.
I LOVE CHAEYOUNG ❤❤❤❤
The divas are all back, but I miss VCHA more 🎉🎉 😢😢
The song is perfect at every moment, but why is leeknow scant? I didn't understand this.
This my second time listening to this and I’m already singing my heart out to it very addictive I LOVE IT
ITS ACTUALLY CRAZY I LOVVEEE ITTTT
This sounds like an itzy reject
Kendall ate so hard the song
JYP put in the money
The song is so good I can’t stop listening to it
God forbid pls spend some money on these girls
give them the same treatment as Katseye . put in the money
YADA YADA NOISE ——— 👏👏👏
My strawberry princess
I'm not a hater here I'm a fan of Twice and I listened also to the songs of ITZY, I want to share my thoughts about  this, First of all I loved the melody, It's catchy but not to catchy to be remembered in my opinion, like what Katseye (not a fan) did with their music like in one second boom their music and dance went a hit. Their voice there were some parts that I don't really like. The group name it's okay for me, and I need to know the meaning behind it and what message or intentions to their future fans  This new girl group of JYP need to prove themselves  because their are big guns already in this industry and in international
I don’t know what this is but it’s lwk so cool
1:44 is such a slay
jyp taking a year to give them an itzy song that supposed to be in born to be album
Where the f is the budget
شنو الخراء هذا ؟!!!
temazooo
WHY IS IT SO SHORT!! THIS DON'T SATISFY MY THIRST FOR CHAEYOUNG SOLO!!
They grown real fast😭
You guys need to syfm you complain so much.
❤❤This is Chaeyoung ❤❤🍓🍓
Waitttt it’s growing on me !
Ya llegamos al millón ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Yesss girlset
What happened to vcha
😍🙏🏼
only 2 minutes ???!!!!
Just disband atp if you can’t promote them
2:28 HA Get THOSE WHO HATE FELIX 😂❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Koreans no more singing in there language but to impress the west
Idk about the intro lmao but the rest was 🔥
iloveitttt
man JYP keeps trying the same krapp over n over again..  hyung....... NO ONE CARES ABOUT WESTERN KPOP GROUPS! GIVE UP!
Choreography video before the actual MV? 🤣 Spend money for GirlSet omg...
I love the song but I wish it was AT LEAST 3 minutes long
Ahora solo falta el MV please😭🙏🏻
What is this erm
We wait all this time and we don't have even a Mv????? JYP??????🤨🤨
welcome back, excited for the comeback
Kendall❤
Tami Eu es esto me encanta 🥳🥳🥳🥳
this is pure Chaeyoung from beginning to end, i can’t wait till the album arrives!!!
What just happened
Perfect
JYPE needs to spend some money on this group
Loving the vibes!!! Them golden era  😍
Están fuertes ❤ espectacular 🤩🤩
Go girls💖
The song is nice, but I feel it needs more work. I mean, they should work on it in a better place.😊
Yall its just the choreo chill
That low badget is killing me up !!! Ahhh video 😂😭😭
A2K dan beri burdayızzzzz❤️
Sonuna kadar destekliyorum ❤️❤️❤️
ILLIT born in the 5 gen of kpop, but they are so second gen code, i love it❤
The aestheticss🫶🏻
Sin muy buenas pero queremos más foco para ellas❤️‍🔥
JYP necesitamos más contenido, MV y más promocion por favor
WHAT THE FREAAAAKKKKKK
Me too
mv when?????
please jyp give them an MV give Girlset  justice if you want them to have a solid reputation  😭💗
La pelirroja se parece mucho a Anita
‘ Spend some money on me money on me ‘ PLEASE DO-
jype is obviously dumb
UWAAAAHHHH🎉🎉
2.28 heters gonna hate 💯
Y EL M/V???
This is AG squad's dance
Soooooo goood !
Love this song ❤
HATERS ARE GONNA HATEEEE TELL EM
It's very good. I loved it.
Sii que JYP gaste dinero en ellas 🤑 ❤❤❤ waaaaaaaa son excelentes
COMMAS IS AYRA STARR'S SONGGGGG😭😭😭
We definitely needed a song like this, it was perfect🫡
1:25 gente a anitta
I'm sure the company didn't want to give them a good budget to make an MV, since they owe a lot, and they need to pay their debts with the company since they have a signed contract, the only thing we can do is give them a lot of support so that they get out of this, go support them on all platforms.
HOLY MOLY GUACAMOLE WOAHAHAHHAJEJDJDJDBRJDBFHD
There you have it????
Happy birthday Wonyoung! 🥳🥳🥳
Kiof and Katseye vibe
The comeback is okay, the dance performance was amazing, but the set and the song overall was mid
This song is way too good but way too short, do better jype
Ahhh Rocky Horrer theme!!! Yessss
I am literally watching this for the fifth time !!!!!!😭🔥

OMGG
The woman was too stunned to speak 🗣️ and that is literally me 💅

OMGGG!!!!
え？これVCHA？ いいじゃん
The song is really good and the singers' skills hve improved a lot.... But What is up with MV???!!!
JYP? 이제 뮤비를 보여주시죠
this is more of close up/expression ver than choreography ver hellow????
❤❤❤❤❤
THEY REACHED 1M VIEWS, HELL YEAH.. let’s get them up! They deserve it and so much more I am so proud of them <333
1 MILLION VIEWS GUYSSSSSS LET KEEP IT GOING

They deserve more
Plz jyp give them a bigger song and spend money on them I being with them since their survival show so it's bit disappointed 😭,,,,,,,,, this song is tooo short at all we all will except them positively so don't think much , work on them
Felicitaciones chicas ya tienen 1 millón, ustedes merecen todo el éxito
Always Vcha 💔😰
Omg these poor girls… 😭 this choreography is awful. JYP why are you like this???
Ya estamos por el millón vamos por mas chicas 💖
JYP's answer to Katseye😅
who choreographed this?
The song is so dope
LEXIマジでカッコいい！！超イケてる🔥🔥🔥
WE NEED A M/V !!!!
HAPPY 1 MILLIONS GIRLS ❤❤
So lackluster tho :T
Was this recorded in a microwave ? The camera is too shaky
GIRLSET  You are so Cool‼
MOTHERS GOT ONE MILLION VIEWS
HAPPPYYY 1 MILLION, COMMASSSS!!! LET’S GOOO 5MILLL!!!
My channel also sings a lot of songs. I hope you can listen to them.
YAYY 2M NEXT
Little katseye
COOOOOL!!!!!!
Mini katseye
GIRLSET has potential of being the next big thing if jyp listens to us
this is soo cvnty
I was searching for the MV to watch it first, but there is none, how in their first song as a new group they don’t have an MV?? Feel so much for the girls who trained a lot of hours, days, weeks to just get a choreography version
1M 🥲
They got them recording this in a changing room
I wish that there would be a mv too for this song
おめでとう100万回再生🎉❤
I’m for the rebrand and kind of like the song, but I’m really not feeling the styling. The colours are way too stark, I don’t think any of them suit these outfits and colours imo. And they didn’t have to go do a full 180 in my opinion, they can keep a little sweetness/cuteness in parts without it sounding like kids bop/vcha
コンセプトが勝ちすぎてるし、メンバーの気持ちが一つで気合を感じます❤️‍🔥 「かわいい」「かっこいい」という言葉じゃ足りなくて、「美しい」って感じた*✦︎⋆︎  ケンダルの甘い声がいいスパイスになってる！ 心から、おかえりなさい😭！
メチャメチャ歌うめぇ😳💦
HAPPY 1M 🎉❤
オーディション観てました😊 曲最高😍応援してます！！ JYPファミリーファイティン！
1M yeahhhh girls❤❤
Wish we had an mv
Finally 1m v!3ws
Song is quite boring
オーディションから観てたから、こうして再スタートしたのが嬉しいです😂皆、大変だったよね😭これからもJYPグループとして応援します❗with Uより
1м
They did amazing.
Where's the MV? I was expecting an MV! Uhhhh, JYPE explain yourself?  I mean thanks for the choreo video, but the build up to this release is giving me MV? Did I miss anything that it's actually a choreo and single without MV?
Falta pouco para 1M ,vamos lá ❤❤
케일리와 문제의 kg가 빠졌구나.... 뭐 잘 됬으면 좋겠다 얘들 오디션 a2k부터 봐왔던  삼촌팬~~
The trailer had other sets behind them wheres the mv 😔💔
진심으로 GIRLSET 의 꿈이 이루어지길 기원합니다. 한국 속담에 이런말이 있습니다. " 인내는 쓰고 열매는 달다. "
SPEND SOME MONEY ON GIRLSER JYP
사바나 ❤
Potential fandom names Mindsets, Onsets, GLights, legends,
omg they’re so close of 1M views
GIRLSETファイティーン‪
0:23 Kendall ily 🎀🤍🪽 Come to SCOTLAND UK 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
com o orçamento de uma coxinha com caldo de cana fica difícil né jyp
Come to Scotland UK 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Love you girls supported you since A2K 🫶🏻💕💕💕
These girls deserve so much better. Give them an actual chorus, actual choreography and let them dance somewhere other than a tiny dressing room. JYP, you’re killing their talent.
I'm literally scratching my head wondering if this is both the official MV plus choreography?
Close to 1M views let's gooo
甘さがなくて，すごくいい！ きっと、このMVよりもステージの方が何倍も彼女達を輝かせてくれると思った。楽しみです。
Okie... first of all it's great..they are shining....and also I love the concept... it's a new version of jyp....love u girls...!!🎀👠❤️(Jyp Spend some money on these girls...they deserve it...)👍
４人で再スタート 良い結果になるよ
Let's go 1M!
Honestly I love the song, it's catchy  But the only problem is the video making  The camera work isn't good, n the bg looks cheap
JYP better PROMOTE THEM! Whether it's in Korea or here in the United States.
Jyp please spend some money on them
Mv?
Girlset on fireeeee
Is this a new group ?
SO CLOSE TO 1M COME ONNN
1:42 dance breakk
Whoa this actually sounds good
OMG, this is so good❤
色々ごたごたして大変だったと思います。 活動再開楽しみに待っていました！ みんな雰囲気が変わってかっこいい！！ ダンスも最高！ 日本から応援してます❤️
おかえりーー🎉🎉嬉しい☺️❤みんな可愛い😊
OMG YOU GUYS ARE ALMOST AT 1 M VIES
オーディションのときから才能が溢れ出ている4人がRE・SETして戻ってきたね。大人っぽい雰囲気でgood。 個人的には（欲を言えば）、ジーナ、クリスティーナ、ユナを戻してRE・SETして欲しかったな～（無理か・・笑）
nice cb
おめでとう！
#24 trending in the US!!!!
Bruh jyp are you kidding?? This group deserves a better company cuz wth???
Wow this is garbage.  This is JYP? what happened to JYP?
I cant see them having success, their main characters are missing and I think they really bad in dancing, singing, everything. JYP should have just dropped it.
Is it just me or the best fandom name is girlies for girlset❤🎉😂
Honestly this is good, extremely promising! I hope JYP will invest in this group, give them good songs and promotions.
Close to a mill lets stream guys❤❤
Girls fighting!!!
This group is like random people doing cover dances.
Now this is a global group 💖 let's gooo Girlset , my Vcha heart is alive 🎉
Keep streaming
There sooo pretty 😍 ✨️ but jyp ya gotta do better these queens deserve better
Aghhh I’m loving this new wave of diversity in girl groups. Yassss give me all the continents puhlease!!
CONGRATS GIRLS FOR 100K LIKES
GIRLSET IS THE MINDSET ⁉️⁉️
100k likes now!!
I loved the song, good job Girlset!! I'll wait for the MV
I Love it :’)
hey this song is a bop! release this JYP! waaaaaaa
this song is better than expected, quite good for the american market ig, no killing part n too much itzy in it - that's def the downside
JYPはいい加減スタイリングを見直してほしい。大人路線は良いけど、胸のない子に露出が多い服着せてもダサくなるだけ。衣装がダサい。レクシーのメイクも合っていない。
Its giving itzy demo that they rejected. What are those lyrics?? JYP should srsly spend more on them. Such wasted potential of these talented girls.
No entendí...
I'm neither their fans nor any other JYP groups. But what is this? Treat them better.
not giving us an MV is so disappointing
lowk only the chorus is good.
I loveeee
ビジュ良すぎ！！ 応援してるよーーーーー！！！
They are such baddies❤
The song's really cute, but for a  rebrand, starting with a choreography video probably isn't the best choice. And for a choreography video, the camera work is infuriating. But I'm happy the girls are back 🥹
畫面有點晃，怎麼沒有防手震
Yes this song is enough to send someone in a comma 🥰
I'm waiting for the official video 🤡
For a whole damn month I listened this song too much that when it came it fell flat for me. I said for ME What happened to teasers not spoiling anything but teasing us  Where did the rebrand go,I feel like they gave they new hair and mature make up and dipped
YALL STOP COMPARING THEM TO KATSEYE
JYP JUST SPEND SUM MORE MONEY ON THESE GIRLS PLSS
CAMILLA BODY TEAA
THEY ACTUALLY NEED AN ALBUM
THEY NEED AN ALBUM THEY ATE SO HARD
This is “choreography ver.” but you can’t see the choreography! Can we get a better video please
Are they in a Kohl’s dressing room? 😆
😮😮❤❤
yayayay ate bro
That one part where savanna and Camila sound like The Weekend ❤‍🔥👍 so good!!!
Amé.
mvは？
Espere más del vídeo musical, la verdad no espere algo, pero si me decepcionó que no le dieran la producción que merece
Guys calm down, I think it's marketing strategy to released dance version than mv to look not so typical and the short song is new trend now. The girls keep spoiling their song writing experience so album will drop soon. If no MV thanks but if with MV for this song them double the thanks. Trust the process!
We need the mv now 😭😭😭😭
JYP nation stans PH where are you? Support Girlset gals.
JYP Nation PH where are you? Support Girlset gals
Unlock 1M guys
I came to see NiziU's Rema & Nina dance, it's amazing
Song is a banger, just praying for a real MV and > 2:30 in length for the next single.
I believe a full album will come out soon
I love the song but I expected to have Mv
I love this song!!! This is so underrated
Dimana kaylee??
かなり中毒性高い！こういう踊れるのが良い！
This is the debut song they deserved in the first place. Don't get me wrong, i understand why the girl next door vibe with vcha, and i loved their music then, and understood that they had quite young members at the time. but this vibe we're getting from girlset? that's what's gonna grab people's attention, and i think this was a great song, albeit definitely too short, and it definitely deserved an actual music video. hope to see more like this, with actual money being spent on these girls who have worked way too hard and dealt with way too much to get less than what they deserve!
I'm begging you jyp post the MV now people hate them I love the song I'm begging you to post it now.
Happy 100,000 likes on Commas!!
Our Girls Fighting
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I MISSED YALL ❤
ok it's not catchy song
They look so much better just the 4 of them, super talented and great dance
it looks like Girlset budget is just 50 dollars
WOWWW 💗💋💫
Next Katseye????
https://youtube.com/shorts/rykxqANutis?si=Sm9njLLVBCmHnCz4
song so catchy and good i almost forgot their company mistreated one of them until they tried to commit suicide, thank god i still remember
0:27 amo divino lloro
Lexus throwing out her damn back so hard I'm feeling it I think  I crippled my spine just watching TnT
Low budget
Spend some money on me on me ye jyp spend some money on them
ELLAS SON GRANDIOSAS, LAS AMO MUCHOOO
js me or does the chorus not fit
I need a longer version please. We all agree it's a hit.
They sound amazing and look great!!!!
AMO ESTE REGRESO ❤
song fire, their enjoying it, coreography fire, deserve an actuak mv! 🤍🤍🤍
Te amo pero tu empresa me decepciona, señor JYP porf avor apoyalas y cuidalas tiene mucho talento mi chicas.
MV pleaseeee
cant believe this is VCHA?? this feel so fresh and reminded me of MissA, hope they treated better! Rooting for them!
Me gustó un montón la canción pero la verdad esperaba más por parte de su empresa
Day 2 finishing workout at gym to this ❤😊
Yall keep begging for a MV like they're not gonna drop real MV's ever, you better be there when all the new stuff comes out in force then ! Cause you should know this is just a (🔥) teaser 👏🏼
sounds like an itzy cancelled song😢
WAIT THIS ATE LWK
YAYAYA
We need an actual mv JYP 😫😫
I miss Melissa's singing voice
aah can't wait for another upcoming songs
🎇🎇🎇🎇💃💃
Jyp pensé que ya habías aprendido 😢
Pensé que era el MV ,y la espera ?? Ya sabía jyp deseocionando 🫡🙃
Savanna kinda looks like ice spice
jpye for a girl group that you’re supposedly trying to rebrand you sure are doing the bare minimum. 2 minute song, cheap ass choreo video you’re trying to pass off as an mv?? is the creative team just bankrupt af? because none of these are helpful in changing the image of the girls, i feel bad for them
Omg they ATE this actually  The problem with JYP, why are u doing that??
SO SO GOOD
Savanna bias!! Lexi wrecker. Kendall incoming bias. Camila wins main slayer.
Niziu showed support by doing the chorus dance cover they were doing to promote this 🤗🥹💓
Super geniales hermosas talentosas
QUE VOCESSSSSSS DIOSSSSS WOWWW ❤❤
KEEP GOING GIRLS YALL SLAY 😝
Devoraronnnnnn 💥💥💥💥
WE NEED THE MV NOW 😞💗
AMEEEEE
A musica uma merda, nem pra ter um mv?????
Cara Jyp explode porra
GIRLSET KILLED IT, THIS SONG IS SO AMAZING, I LOVE YOU GIRLS ♡♡♡♡
Guys Girlset debuted with 129,853 on Spotify . And let me remind you these numbers were possible even during a dumb boycott, Jyp bad promo , and after a long hiatus . Oh girlset you will be big!!
ok am i the only one got motion sickness? not even kidding atp
日本語コメント多いね笑
Not them giving them a itzy reject song
I’ll have to compare. People always talk about how katseye are the “lucky” ones, but did you see how they’re being promoted heavily? Like JYPE (America) is not helping them. This song sounds so much like NMIXX (not the lyrics), and they didn’t even release an MV. The girls are SO talented, but JYPE is NOT doing its job.
Almost 100k likes
Que saudade senti de voces meninas.. como fã desde o a2k eu fiquei muito abalada com tudo que tava acontecendo e ja tinha perdido as esperanças e tentei aceitar o fim dps que a kaylee anunciou a saída, ate que  de repente vcs anunciaram o rebrand, mesmo sendo apenas 4 fiquei muito feliz que vocês nao desistiram, sentirei falta da kg e da kaylee pra sempre💔💔 Mas estoi muito orgulhosa de vocês e vou continuar apoiando vocês como sempre fiz e prometi😭
This is it?? No mv😔😔😔
We need more music from them !❤ 0:13 0:15 she’s so beautiful and this new look !
WERK IT GIRLS
I’m happy with this for now but I do want the MV! Lol I’m so happy for them! Finally!
Yes, spend some money on them 😭
This whole concept of mature looks and sound.. way better than VCHA. Was never a fan of VCHA
0:44 Lexi's flexibility is insane 🥰❤️
love this song
yall don’t get it it’s good
Katseye ended those flops
Que buena canción! ¿Qué te costaba JYP?
es buenísima 😭😭😭
My favorite it “twice likely”
Son muy talentosas,las quiero ❤
Que bonitas
I don’t hate the song, but I really miss Vcha… Still, I'm looking forward to your other songs. Btw, wtf JYP, you seriously only gave them two minutes?
They have great vocals, amazing dance skills and presence but the song... Not a fan of such short songs, it also reminds me of fifth harmony and I wasn't a fan of them.
제와피야 뮤비를 풀어야지 생각이 없어? 얘네를 키울 의지는 있는거야?  그룹을 다시 데뷔시킬거면 제대로 서포트를 해라…
#26 USA #10 Singapore #27 NewZeaLand Oh cmmon just give us the mv already its fine if u forgot to upload it JUST GIVE IT TO US
THIS IS TEA! YESSS, QUEENS! ❤❤
日本から応援してます！！！！😭
Kendall voice is so cuttie

Why post the dance performance before MV JYP? This looks messy...
I LOVE YOU GIRLSSS
936.025

Te pasaste jyp en donde esta el mv?, ellas todas hermosas y me gusto la canción
0:37 ここからのL e x iめっちゃ好き。可動域どうなってる？地面スレスレまで体低い体制の振りできるのやばい😮❤
JYP We ask you for a little more quality for my girls 😔
ALMOST 1 MILLION GUYS
1:39 Gnarly reference?
Ellas son verdaderamente populares en Japón? Veo muchos comentarios japoneses 😮
너무 야한데...  수위좀 낮춰줘
Where’s the actual music video ???  Edit: nvm I much prefer the choreography version , cuz wtf was the “official mv” big fckn yikes
No me gusto mucho el inicio siento que es mucho de golpe con el coro y super repetitibo esata bien pero le daria 6/10
GUYS WE NEED TO GET THIS VIRAL ‼️😭
This is a good change in direction for them. Seems like JYPE is taking fan opinions to heart, changing the group name and changing the style of music. Hoping for their success! Personally, I think the choreo could better tho lol, but the song is catchy
we love u 4cha
Who is the black hair girl?
They could be the next blackpink as a group of four if JYP handles the group better so pleaaase JYP DO BETTEEEER these poor girls worked way too hard to not be given tracks like gnarly and cool concepts as they deserve
This song was promoted for a whole month and there's only a video recorded in a dressing room, this girls deserve better 😢
where is the MV?
Cheeeeeeeap. It's giving A.I lyrics
Anitta?
Here before 1 million likes ❤
I swear JYP is the problem, these girls so talanted but his taste in music so bad
Spam watch this so it gets to 1M it kept playing for 3h now 😭 it’s just in the background for me 😅
arrasaram ❤❤🎉
HO give us the MV....
略語は「ガルセ」で合ってますか？？
They deserved a more powerful comeback with the power they have, they deserved it at another level, but it's still okay with this Girlset comeback.
They should’ve kept savannahs curls 😭
Only bad thing abt this song is that it finishes in what feels like a millisecond 😭
After all this time, people STILL don't understand that jyp has nothing to do with this. First off he's not the CEO he doesn't have control over the production. Also if you want to target anger do it towards the American branch not jyp as a whole
Obsess
920k WE NEED TO GET TO 1M!
1million pls
Savanna’s hair is giving ice spice
love youuuuu so muchh
Let's go 1 million
Can’t stop listening and I’m so fascinated with the dance!!
Ate
LOVE
1:45  YEAH JYP!! SPEND SOME MONEY ON THEM

Great GIRLSET!!!! Downloaded instantly!
The choreos cute cant even lie
Savannah a cara da Anitta mds
JYP WE NEED MORE, MOOOOOoooOoooRE FOR THE GIRLS!!!
SONG IS RIGHT JYP SPEND SOME MONEY ON EM
I love
I don't know why I expected more from jyp.  It's cute, but no , I failed to digest it
YALL! Realize how it says "Version" so it might actually get a music video!
A pesar de lo q digan los haters para ser su regreso les ha ido muy bien, japon si las ha recibido tan bien q alla las estan escuchando y otros paises asi q nuestras chicas estan llegando con fuerza
La coreografía todo que ver
bro the budget is not budgeting
POR FIN YO SI LES TENIA FE CHICAAAAAAAAAAAAS
little katseye??
Omg im living and im begging for more😔✋
JYP TRTALES BIEN!!! PORQUE ANTE LOS OJOS DE TODOS ERES LA PEOR EMPRESA BASURA MALTRATADORA DE LOS IDOLS!!!!
I hope they get 1M ☘️🔥🔥
Its a mess prefer when they were vcha at least that had some order
Hermosas!!! Divinas!!! Goooo girls!
i love my girls but it actually looks so… cheap😭
Hard work done well
go girls🔥🔥🔥
SPEND SOME MONEY ON THEM NOW JYP!!!!
This is the worst camera work i've ever seen on a performance video
Savanna owns this era
me gusto y eso que ni las conosco
Low budget mv. So sad
we waited so long and still didn't get an MV?? I need more of GIRLSET
Se merecen lo mejor
Que lindaaaaas 😭😭😭💗💗
I like most of the song, ESPECIALLY the bridge sounds wonderful, but man...that chorus, I don't think I like the chorus 'you keep looking at me, looking at me' for some reason it just doesn't sound good to me. Just personal opinion, I'm not trying to spread hate or anything insulting, they can sing and clearly have a lot of performance power, it's just the song structure is making me go '???'
And when will the real MV be?…I don’t think this is going to be the MV Officially
Haters can GTFO. Proud of you ladies! Yall look and soynd amazing and I can't wait to hear what else you have for us ❤
Love you so much baby girl and I’m glad you’re doing better and I’m so happy for you
Mis chicas no me decepcionan. Las esperé con mucho anhelo, mi orgullo hacia ellas es genuino, las quiero mucho 💖✨
Can we stop the hate train for JYP like genuinely. Even the less famous groups from his company always have come back and actually good songs. Late but not in basement. They actually trying something new lets be more positive. The vocals are amazing
Entre más lo veo más me gusta
I AM SO GAGGEDD EO PROUD OF THEM
100 percent supporting this new path for them SLAYYYY
why do I feel so sad watching this😢 they all want and deserve this dream so much, but they're stuck with a label that just doesn't seem to care at all. it makes me want to cry
OMFG
Pretty sure mv will be there
Nmms blanquearon a todas
But...commas are free? Here, have some: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Otherwise, the implication is that they're for sale and I don't think they want to go down that road.
they’re all so talented but my god this song sucks😭
Oh Girlset deserve an album after all this
LETS SUPPORT GIRLSET ❤
This deserve an really MV with more quality
Yo las amo tanto chicas ❤️😍
Camilla's and Lexi's vocals sound amazing here!! Savanna's too!!
Tbh they should have just disbanded.. after kg’s lawsuit i wasn’t expecting a sudden burst of happiness while she suffers in what happened
Jyp never fails in making shit songs
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
900k❤❤❤ LETS GOOO
Tanta espera para esto??? 😂
Bro vocals are insane
No korean in the song and its somhow cald kpop
I LOVE IT!!! PLEASE JYP DON'T RUIN THEM AND STOP WHITE WASHING SAVANNAH PLEASE 💗💗💗💗💋💋💋💋💋💋❣❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
This girl group!!! Pretty - Spicy - Talented  Their dance really awesome and their energy so wonderful 👍🏻❤️
0:13 Savanna ate that
Okay girlset!
For all of you hating on them for just no reason, or comparing them with the other GG that for me should be working together and making HEALTH featuring works.. I just can say...  It's all consider idol's mental health until it's a group you don't like.   You guys are sick and need a full psychological treatment as soon as possible, stop creating fights between fandom and artists.. bunch of hypocrites!  GIRLSET! Fighting <3
Just bought this on itunes. Let's get it in the top 10!!!
This song is so catchy!! I'm already know all of the lyrics lol that a fire song 🤩
They look so much older now 😮 I love this so much and hope a MV comes soon ❤❤
WHERES THE MV JYPE
Que feo video mala producción, quieren hacerlas fracasar 👎🏻
MY GIRLSSS, YALL DID SO GOOD. IM REALLY IMPRESSED. SO EXCITED FOR WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS ❤️
Mmmmm.... no actually what is the identity?  😮 sounds a generic Kpop song
i have to say, these shots absolutely suck  "choreography version" and all we can see are facials and close ups
Why u limit there budget jyp give them a music video 😩
Amo demasiado😍
love the choreo & style
No MV?
love the song, vocal, visuals and dance from the girls ❤ hopefully we get an mv!!! 🤞
QUE ES ESTO😭 (Amo a las chicas,merecian algo mejor)
I love the vocals
another disappointment from jyp. girlset deserves better.
1:40 the high note oommmggg!!! 🔥
the choreo is so gooodddd
0:50 „I've made it on my own so you better put in worth" soo truee✨
the girls did amazing,  lots of love for them. but JYP, PLEASE invest money in them cause thia feels cheap 😭😭
Steam Commas ❤❤
They deserve a music video.
I hate JYP
Jyp is sooo easy on them
0:32 Camila in this frame it’s on fire 🔥 I love this song ✨
THEY ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBSSSSSSSS🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Por qué no subieron MV? I want it
The song is so good
Is there not a music video
KPOP without the K
I thought its MV 😢
The way Gina and Christina would have fit this concept so well...
MASSIVE STREAM
I LIKE COMMAS
where is the mv??? 😭
WE NEED MVV
this is fireeee
I dont like girlset anymore. I was a huge VCHA fan, but then I started unstanning them. Idk why but now I cant stand them
OMG I MISSED THEM SO MUCH AAA I LOVE COMMAS!!!!💖❤💗😭😭
Yes its short, BUT IVE BEEN OBSESSED AND ITS BEEN REPLATYED TOO MANY TIMES ALRR😭😭 luv u GIRLSET❤ hope all is well this time
This actually ate dowwwwnnnnnn sooooooo hard, the girls did naaawwwttttt comw to playyyyy
I love you all sm
LEXIIIIIIIII OMG
Guys this is just a preview to see if they have enough support to release things like an album 😭
Omg Lexie is hot 🥵
They sound so good omg ❤
Two minutes? I guess this can be my tooth brushing song 🤷‍♀️
ME ENCANTAAAAA 💖
Its too much trying too hard … they try to be so sexy so hard its uncomfortable
Amooo, estuve esperando demasiado tiempo 🥺🥺🙌🙌
Me encanta la voz de kendall
Porque les quitaron presupuestos
niziuのホールツアーで一緒にきてくれないかな
❤
Y el mv ?
Okay, slay!!
Kendall's voice is so pretty and distinctive I love it so much , the song is good we need an MV please
Aquí Blink apoyando
blonde fits camila so well omggg
Can they not afford a camera that focuses?  Yikes on bikes
okay girlss🫦🫦
primero las maltratan y después les quitan presupuesto :(
Ya me sabía la canción de tanto que la ponían en los vídeos 😭😭😭
ME ENCANTAAA
What a disgrace what the actual hell is JYP doing the song is soo short no one I MEAN no one wohld be out of breathe  Ehat the flipidy flip flop afe these lyrics JYP and their laxy butt cheeks can't even come up was a desent song AND the camera works who is behind that camera
The song is not that bad but unfortunately it's not catchy, you don't want to sing or dance along with them. They've changed their style but the song almost sound the same as when they're VCHA minus the Disney vibe.   JYP if it's the choreography version MV why is the camera work like that? It looks vefy amateurish. And why are they in such a small room, it looks like they don't even have enough place to do their choreography. Come on! Don't sabotage them again, let them go if you don't want to invest in them, don't make them lose their youth and passion.
I love this concept for girlset. I hope we get another song soon or an mv. JYPE better not mess this up
❤❤❤
I like the music, but no promotion and an MV?
Wow they are really good but I’ve seen no promo for them whatsoever… insanely talented I can tell but I think the issue lies in JYP…
LINDONASSSS
ATEEEEE
The camera man needs to be fired. The song is okay but this "M/V" just gives me a headache. Literally.
this is the mv..?
It is clear that JYP does not take it seriously.
Slaayyyy but treat them like your others groups jaypapi
So happy to see you girls ❤
I am worried looking at Lexi's leg at the end pose. Is leg okay? But I enjoyed this new direction.
노래가 너무 예쁘고 너무 좋았어요,my.bias Is Kendall i love You Kendall ❤❤❤❤❤❤
JYPE please put some trust in this group and FUND them. We didn't even get an mv and this performance mv screams low budget. The song being so short is a whole another topic for discussion. All that hype for this???
Я думаю, что перезапуск удался. Надеюсь теперь группу будут лучше продвигать ❤
KENDALL LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL AND WHAT A NICE SONG TO LISTEN TO
Мне хватило всего, кроме клипа пожалуйста
GIRLSET❤
Are they in the middle of an earthquake?  Who is controlling the camera. JYP PLEASE spend money on them because wtf is going awnnn. Why is the bridge so far into the song and why is the song shorter than my will to live. Im crying😭
this feels so cheap, even the song im sorry this is not it
😝🤏🤏 clock ittt JYP U HAVE BETTER RCOME HERE TO DROP SOME MONEYYY💸💸💸💸💵💵💵💵
So cheap😮
Iconic❤💫
Choregraphy video first and then MV. Shouldn’t it be the other way 🤨 no hate I just want the best for these girls
ifeel bad for them
People keep blaming JYPE for the budget when Republic Records needs to be doing its job too.
https://youtu.be/j52xmxSYYIw?si=shnstoCBmcYZEV6Z
I hate it. This is awful. 2:02 minutes? Is this a joke?
Girlies served vocals, visuals AND SOTY 😭💖
https://youtu.be/j52xmxSYYIw?si=shnstoCBmcYZEV6Z
okay but can we talk about how good the choreography is especially after the bridge, i expected no less from jyp but it’s EATINGGG
yes girlssss
VOCALSSSSS
COMMMMASSSSS
you keep looking at me like you wannaaaaaa
#27 in the US!
my bf said he likes them better than bp lol
Ya casi llegamos a los 900M si se puede ❤vamos Lexi Camila Savanna Kendall
LETS GET THEM TO A MILLION VIEWS!!
I love how they look healthy ❤
For an official rebrand this was pretty underwhelming… I mean, I was expecting so much, the song is good, the girls look gorgeous, this concept definitely fits them well, they even did a whole marketing campaign from almost a month before release so WHY NOT GIVE THEM A FULL MV???
Jyp what are you doing you need to do a proper mv for this girls😭😭😭
1ヶ月前から期待させておいて、出たのがこの低予算のMV？ 彼女たちがもっとすごいことができるとわかっているからこそ、物足りない。
the song was so short like only 2 min? js like gnarly
lets go GIRLSET ❤️‍🩹 !!!!!!! this was so good ;)

Increíble❤
please rise for the national sugar daddy anthem
Anitta e voce? hahaha
Commas❤❤❤
The song is GOOD the vocals are flawless 🙌🏻
The song is so good but It's a whole rebrand.... They could have atleast shot this at a few different places like choreography vers even if it's just a choreo ver. And just camera zoom ins on their faces, no lighting effects, no different outfits, just a 2 min dance video. If they don't care about the girls at all why're they even trying- of well they seem to not be trying at all.  They deserve better
4❤
The girls have grown so much 💙
honestly, this is good but I don’t think it’s for me.. they overplayed the chorus too much on tiktok, so now I can’t even enjoy it. And yes I know every group does that for their debut, but honestly it’s not very enjoyable anymore
SO CATCHYYYYY
めっちゃいい！大正解
I love it
Ahhhhhhh❤
These girls are so talented!!! I wish we get an actual mv tho😢
Savana is annita 😍🤩
teased the song for over a month to release choreo that was already all over the tiktok with re-used clothes from NMIXX dice era.. where is the mv!?
MV??
Love it love it love it
This will be my new katseye pls don’t disappoint
1 day ago
this my first time my jaw dropped for a song, this is so good
the camerawork sucks soooo bad and why are they crammed into a little box of a room????? where is the budget??????
im really starting to like this song 😭
Song: Commas Budget: Lacking commas 😭 JYP give them a budget PLEASE
The choreography is so addictive 😍
Wow! The dance is really good! 😮
I honestly think the song is short to easily increase the chances of more streams. Can’t wait to hear what else GIRLSET has in store!
It looks really low budget .. JYP needs to invest in these girls because they are so incredibly talented
Osea que no hay MV????? :"(
MV? 😢😢😢 Ellas merecen más atención y mejor inversión 😢  Latinas mamis
they ate that. but if jyp wants them to succeed, they have to give THEM GIRLIES MORE BUDGET. FRFR!
proud of you guys 💅💖
It so good why is it so short tho
Lowkey feels like Jyp is trynna make a cheap version of katseye
おかえりー！！ 今後はもっと活躍が見れますように
THIS SONG IS SUCH A HIT! IMAGINE IF THEY KEEP RELEASING MORE MUSIC THEY WILL BE MORE POPULAR LIKE BLACKPINK
Sarı saçlı, sesi ince olan kızın adı ne?
They forcing the baddie concept but it doesnt match them
😭😭🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩
this is horrible 😭😭
Let me tell you all honestly the debute of girlset is soo worst, as a Vlight Vcha Songs were better, I mean The girls looks forced and Not Fitting in the concept, The song sounds like a Rejected and unfinished demo , No Proper Mv , No Proper choreography, No originality, No Identity, The girls have so Much talent, The group now looks like A New local american Budget Unknown Independent Group , Like they had sevond chance i expected atleast good from JYPE this type Nothing was better, JYPE failing So bad wasting all talent and bringing down their future
100k likes soon!! Please share this video too others
와 누군데 jyp달고 노래 나온건지 모르겠는데 존나 좋네
캔달 와.. 진짜 미쳤다 너무 멋지다
This.......... isn't a good song 😢😢😢😢😢, At all.
뮤비는 언제 나오나요??
Este nuevo concepto me encantaaaaaaaaaaaa, son fabulosas 🥰🥰🥰
待ってました〜〜🎉
JYP PLZZZ COVER AND TAKE CARE!!!!!! OF THEM THEY ARE STILLL MINORSSS 😊
1M day for a choreography video. Our girls are only going up!
I know I shouldn't say this but, there's something I don't like about the group, like she doesn't fit in with them, I really need the m/v
We're going for 1M views
Lexus Lexus Lexus
845k
i was expecting more ngl..
this song isnt bad but omg jyp these girls have potential get rid of ur marketing team
LETS GET 1M ASAP
So we won’t have an MV!
American Jyp could have done better
😮 Hold UP!! DamNNnNn! Are these the same ladies? WHAT? I'm SHOOK-ETH! ❤❤❤❤
وش ذا مصورين بنوكيا
i hate u jyp, was it so difficult to give them an mv?
Let's gooo GIRLSET ❤❤🎉🎉
❤
めちゃくちゃ良い✨✨✨✨
GIRLSET deserved a spot in the Weekly Rotation with this one ❤️
where is the music video??? JYP needs to stop playing
STREAM TO 1M TODAY GUYS
待ってたよー！！応援しています！！！！素敵な4人！
Dead ass this song is constantly on replay on my screen and in my head ❤😂❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OK BUT KENDAL'S VOCALS?! 😭✋🏻🫠
Vcha was way better they made the girls look bad with the hair except lexus
My bias isnt here i wish kaylee was here i cant even recognize the girls btw can anyone tell me their names
Jyp pls give them an MV
Y’ALL NEED TO STREAM
me gusta girlset pero para mi {no es hate} no me gusto la cancion ,pero me gusta el concepto ,no estoy diciendo de hate si no es mi opinion
omg
I love the bridge❤
Savana and her forehead 😂I love it its so shiny
Starting the the song with choreography is amazing but the question is where is the mv
おかえり🫶
🎉🎉🎉
I’m gonna have to get use to the 4 and not 6
Why are some of y'all hating on this song ? If you don't like it then don't comment because I think the song is really good
26 on trending in the US
i think it’s stupid to compare them to katseye cause all the girls in both group are so talented, but one think i want to compare is the managment, i think the managment for girlset should wake up and learn from their direct competitor, let’s not waste this 4 girl’s talent
Too short, spoiled the whole chorus before the song came out, JYP why do you hate my girls 😭😭😭
色々あったけどコンセプト変えてもいい感じだと思うし悪評なんかに負けずに上手くいってほしいな！
Brilliant, I’m glad JYP and RR decided to re-brand these talented ladies Commas is a hit!
SAVANNA: LOS ANGELES UNITED STATES CAMILA : BARCELONA , SPAIN (ME TOO) KENDALL: FORT WORTH , UNITED STATES LEXI: SHEYBOYGAN UNITED STATES
운동화 리폼 끝난 줄 알았는 데 여기서 볼 줄이야....
Wow
SLAAAAAAAAAY
Amazing vocal!!! Thats JYP!!!!
Giving ITZY bside but 1min less because budget didn’t allow for it
Wtf is this
Nao deixem essa beldade flopar
They're so talented
❤❤❤❤❤
Is there going to be an actual mv though but love this though
The song is not enough to compete with katseye. This is a generic kpop sound
No wait they ateeee
Let’s go
theres more comments here than listeners on spotify...
2 MINUTES WTF
are they the previous V-Cha members?
Why is the song way too short and has no MV??
新しいコンセプトすごくメンバーみんなに合ってるしこれからの活躍が楽しみ！ 待ってたよー
the song is short
Where's the mv?
After a hiatus I think they deserve an actual MV JYP !!!
Is this the only official MV??? Is it really???? HOLY CRAP
2 MINUTES AND NO ACTUAL MV. ARE YOU SERIOUS JYP WTF ARE YOU DOING.
It's Soo good but sooo short
やったーー！！まってた
rolooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
난 뭐 외국 케이팝 댄스팀인줄 알았네.. 일단 코디가 단점을 부각시키고 다소 정신없음 그리고 맴버들이 노래하는데 입모양이 틀리고 그닥 열정이 안보임
え！サバンナの髪がストレートに なってる！！　ビックリ!!
Anitta
こんなこと言ったらいけないかもしれませんが4人になりコンセプトチェンジした結果めちゃくちゃ良くなってませんか?!ビジュアル、ボーカルのバランスも凄く良い❤
Me encanta la canción
Jyp needs to spend some money on an actual MV
here,
Where's the MV JYPE????? But the song is rlly good but just sooo short.
Kendall has this Yuna kinda smug and sass, like she KNOWS she is the shit. Love it !
They don't convince me at all! I mean, I was expecting something better, not something boring. 😒 JYP, give us something better, not a boring group.🙄
صراحة ماتترقع يعني اذا بتصورون فيديو رقص صوره عدل يعني هاي استحي اسميه تصوير حتى😭😭
GIRLSET最高だよーー！！！！新たな門出に❤
GIRLSET IS NOW FOUR, VCHA WILL ALWAYS BE SIX. 💜❤
I love these cool girlies
ITS FIRE!!!!!!!
Omg there backkkkkkkkkk
we need a mv!!!!!!
i like the song and the girls, please don't get me wrong. but vocal training or style jyp gave to kendall and lexi just feels so twice and it's not in a good way. let's let go off this style i beg. that style sounds forced on twice girls too, and now it's forced on kendall and lexi too. please don't do this to them they're so talented to be wasted like that
Where is the mv
This is literally a mockery. How are they going to give us a song without an official MV, especially a song that is supposed to be a debut song? and apart from the very poor quality of the video 😭
Slay
Is no hate but , o conceito tá parecendo mantra de jennie,fora isso eu adorei a coreografia e a música ❤❤❤
this video has made me an Eyekon and a Setizen.  (btw setizen is a name i made for fans of girlset, pls dont attack me 4 it lol)
何度見ても最高！！ダンスもずっとパワフルで、曲も短いのがカッコいいと思う。アルバムになった時に最初にこの曲が来たらアガる！これからたくさん新曲出るの楽しみすぎるー！！！とにかくダンスも歌も最高にカッコいい！！！
켄달이 어른이 되어버린듯...
Wow
Sounds like an Aespa song tbh this is good, especially 0:13
Free them from JYP
MV????
JYPE WHERE THE HELL IS THE MV AND DONT TELL ME THIS THE ONLY FUCKING VIDEO. JYPE OR I AM GONNA MAKE A LAWSUIT MYSELF FOR MESSING WITH MY FEELING
1:27 1:40 my favourite part❤
2:02 for a song and still ATE
Me estas diciendo que es debut sin MV?
It’s good, but it’s a bit of a let down that it’s not longer
OMG THAT ATEEE BUT I WANT THE MV NOW ❤
غريب نزلو اعلان m/v و نزلو ذا كانه مقطع رقص بس  إذا كنتو ناويين تنزلو مقطع رقص نفس ذا ليش من البدايه نزلتو اعلان لل m/v مختلف !!!!!
WE NEEDED ACTUAL MV
A MV next please✨💓
おかえりー！待ってたよ！！
so would there be another version like an actual MV? 🤔
Why were more frames shown in the teaser, but they are not in the clip?😔🤔
Меня укачало из-за камерамэна 🤮мог бы не зумить каждые 2 секунды
Why no MV?
What’s with the terrible camerawork 😭
Bravissimeeee❤❤❤
These girls deserve better choreography ver because those zoom in moments looks so bad or cheap that it aint giving justice to their effort and the song itself 😢
JYP SPEND SOME MONEY ON GIRLSET WTF
Camila is so talented and pretty too. If JYP you better do your job properly and make them famous.
just put nmixx produccion on this orsomthin
Lexi😊😊😊
9k more like we need
You guys look sharp.  I have a feeling the debut will be a success.
I would love to see the music video...
Wowww
Mv?
我是ONCE 我很愛這首歌曲 我希望他們可以去韓國打歌 支持女孩們
The more i listen to the song, the more i love it !
My girlsss The killed this concept❤ So pretty and talented Jyp please we need a music video too
누구??????
Please promote them more
This is so JYP Family coded 😭😭 welcome girlset to the best essence company in kpop
ESO NENAAAAAAASSSSSS
I need moreeee JYP!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
whoever called this boring is dumb ASF this is SO GLOBAL GIRL GROUP CODED. like it just gives the kind of song vibes you’d hear in movies because it got so popular
800K❤❤ LETS GET 1M TODAY❤❤
This is absolutely incredible! The choreography is so clean and synchronized, and everyone's vocals sound amazing. You can really see how much the girls have grown as performers. GIRLSET is definitely going in the right direction with this comeback - can't wait to see what's next! 🔥
オーディションのときすごい応援してて、キャンドルちゃんとか好きなんですけど、4人になっちゃったんですか？グループ名も変わってますか？🥺優しい方教えてください、、
(0-10) (Song 7- Vocals 8- Choreo: 7.5. Outfits- no comment. —Lexie nailed it—10/10 across the board. But the styling overall missed the mark. Camilla’s boots looked oversized, and Kendall & Camilla’s hair tones felt too brassy. Camilla and Savannah’s natural beauty deserves to be celebrated, not washed out. If this is part of a rebrand, JYP should really listen to fan feedback. These girls are stunning—don’t hide that behind weak fashion choices. With that said: Welcome back Girls aka GIRLSET! God Bless your journey!
Oh my Goodness!!
노래는 좋은데.. 화장은 1980년대 복장은 90년대 같음 어린 여가수를 완전 30대로 만드는 매직
If this had been a comeback for KATSEYE or something, it would have succeeded, but quite frankly, it’s just bad. The song doesn’t feel done, and for a rebrand, it feels forced…
GO GRİLSSSS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔪🔥🔪🔥🔪🔥🔪🔥🔥🔪🔥🔪🔥🔪🔥🔥🔪🔥🔪🔪🔥🔪🔥
역시 jyp표  dance 💃 🕺
Queen is back
What in the terrible promotion happened to this song?? I literally wouldn't have known they had a comeback if i didn't decide to open YouTube for the first time in a while
I am gonna be honest. JYP have them a very boring song. Not even a MV. What are they doing? Poor girls.
Why not mv tho? Is there new music coming soon?
Wow...super keren....kapan tayang di SBS, ingkigayo, genie, dll
... THAT WAS SO BAD 😭😭😭😭 fyi: rebranding bc they physically abused their 2 prev members ⚰️
why do most of you guys pissed just because they released choreography version first? i think it’s unique tho. choreography and then mv
sorry but it doesn't feel authentic at all, it's kinda forced and jyp doesn't know how to do this kind of concept at all
WE NEED A MV!! PLZ
THIS DANCE BREAKKK
0:24 Kendall ily 🎀🪽 please come to UK Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I first thought that I was gonna end up making Savana my bias, and she is gorgerous but LEXUS is completely catching my eyes. Her dancing movements hit me hard and I love the vibe she is giving. I completely see me as a fan of yours girls. You alll have my support. I wish u only the best in your whole career. GOD bless you.
需要更多的資源 別浪累了她們的青春
Where is the MV!!???can someone remind me when its drop 🗣️

TRENDING US #26!!! IMAGINE IF JYP MADE THIS A MV THOUGH, IT WOULD OF CHARTED HIGHER
0:36 Y'all I think I'm gay😞
CAMILA HIGH NOTE
OMG THEY ATE
choreography video before official music video is just odd
Kendall'ın sesini nedense ahyeon'un sesine benzettim ❤❤
Sorry but jyp i think jyp make just a perfomance cuz Don't have a budget😮? No hate
I love thiss
Please take more budget on girl's promotions
待ってたよ〜!!おかえりなさい🎉 いいね👍️ボタン1つじゃ足りない😭✨
Sooo, and the MV?
日本からも応援してるぞーーーー!!!!❤️‍🔥
Maybe kaylee and kg dong join this comeback because their too young
MIS NIÑAS
Addictive ,, u keep lookهing at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ( dance)
一直支持你們,等你們出實體唱片!
I’m not moving….
걸셋 노래 좋다~ 제왑 일 더 하자!
おかえりなさい！戻ってくるの待ってました！
Me encanta su nuevo concepto, las chicas han mejorado mucho sus habilidades y se ven más hermosas que nunca.
we need the mv right noww🔥🔥
Bruh where is the MV!
Okay this ateeee
예전 노래들은 K팝 느낌이 많이 났는데 이노랜 미국팝 느낌이 많이 나서 더 좋네요 미국 시장에서 잘될꺼 같음
I'm so incredibly happy for these girls! They killed this one for sure! I hope they have many more successes together! And is it just me, or do they totally remind you of the Bratz!?? Even the promo & cover photos for Commas 100% gave me Bratz Rock Angelz vibes 😂 I love it!!!!!!!
Where is MV. It's like dance performance then mv ??
아 ㅠ 미쳤네 ㅜ 개좋음.... 걸셋아 잘 되쟈 !!!!
my heart is so healed to finally hear more and see more from these TALENTED girls i love GIRLSET 🫶🏻
the best birthday gift in history right here 🙌🏼
I love this song so so much the only thing is it's seems really rushed but the girls ate so much but it was really rushed for me but love the new song (WE NEED A MVVV)
the handheld shaky ass camera is making me head hurt
Me encantaaaaaaaaa❤
活動本当におめでとう！！待ってたよーー！ コンセプトも合ってる！！みんなスキル上がったね！
挑戦的な表情いいですね❤ ダンスやっぱりパワフルでえー。こんなに上半身だけ動く！？ って感動の域！！ もうさいこう！！みんな最高😆 camiraの歌声何度聴いても鳥肌もの。すんごい上手い。
wow they really DONT want to spend money on these girls 😭😭😭😭
JYP got hate for leaving Vcha ,bro created this . Let's see him not let us down !
GIRLSET AMAZING ❤❤❤
Camilaaaa ❤❤❤
また曲が聴けるのを待ってました😢 4人みんな個性がバラバラなのにバランスが最高！
Jyp paran mı bitti canım
I CAN SEE THE KATSEYE MOVES🥀 PLEASE DO SMTH NEW, AT LEAST THE CHOREOGRAPHY... AND THE DANCE MOVES WERE A LITTLE BIT INNOPROPIATE...
is this a cover?
i think this might be the best 2 min kpop song. they were able to have two verses, two choruses, a bridge, a mini dance break??? like they used this two mins in the best way possible
This is so low budget 😂 my girls deserve better ❤
戻ってきてくれてありがとう😭ほんとにうれしいみんなかっこいい女性になっててすごく感動しました😢おかえりなさい
There we go, this is a good start, now let's see what you got for us in the future.  I like the direction they are going in and hope we continue to get even stronger.
Why are y’all supporting this after what was revealed??
2 minutes????
To be honest this would be better than gnarly if JYP just spend their money to girlset😢😢😢Unfortunately gnarly ate at marketing
AND THE MV?? I NEED MORE GIRLSET CONTENT 😭❤️
crushed itttttt
会議室みたいなところで、髪がぐちゃぐちゃなっても踊り続けてるのなんかなぁ…JYP大丈夫か？
Im pretty disappointed we didn't get an actual music video, especially for their rebrand
NO MV??!!
this rebrand has SO much potential!
Ok but what is going on with Lexis legs in the end😭
YES GIRLSET THIS CHOREO
JYP PLEASE PROMOTE THE GIRLS BETTER THAN THIS. IM SO MAD
I thought Jona Viray was here but it's Savanna haha
Cameraman didn’t ate,but girls did SO!!GIRLSET YEAH!❤
جي واي بي ما تعب نفسه يعطي ميزانية لهم , غير ان توزيع الاجزاء ماكان كويس بس البنت ابدعو
JYPE has loads of funds, so why are they holding back for these girls???
Volvieron mis hermosas 🥹❤️‍🩹
Big slay, girls. Big slay.
1:24 I'M THAT GIRL REFERENCE
Money on me money on me 💵💸💰🤑
Jyp mv please
오피셜 뮤비가 필요하단 걸 알지? JYP?!
lexi omggggg😮
SOTY
صدق البنات موهوبات و الاغنية تجنن 😖🎀
SHEEE
it’s crazy how good they are in this concept
Que decepción por parte de jyp, no saben aprovechar el potencial de estas chicas
Como se llama la chica de pelo corto y negro?
MV pls
Parece que sempre foram só as 4.❤❤🤍🖤
Bellas mis niñas ❤❤❤ han crecido
Este es el "mv"? 😮
Ate
カッコいい😂コーチェラがみえますね
정식으로 MV가 나와야지
I want them to collab with Bratz SO👏🏼BAD👏🏼😭❤
the songs lyrics are uhmm a choice 🤔 also the set?😓 their makeovers look amazing though!!
I love this! It doesnt even sound like k-pop anymore, it sounds very fifth harmony/little mix with a bit of  ariana grenade
QUE MÚSICA PERFEITA !!!❤
This is soo good
サムネでまさか・・と思って開いたら😭ずっと待ってたよVCHAーーー もう戻ってこないかもと諦めかけてた矢先に嬉しい！皆綺麗になったね😭
Siempre apoyándolas
IMO this is trash...
Muy linda la coreografía muy lindas ellas  Ya pegadiza la canción, pero se notó el bajo presupuesto que le dieron al video 😢 muy sencillo la neta
La canción tiene un estilo de itzy🤔🤔🤔
Cool
Poor video shooting quality can’t stop these girls
Imagine Kaylee and kg still here😢
They are very talented !🤩
Finally , my A2k heart is full ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Yayyyyyy!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
え、ＭＶじゃないの？？
No entiendo, poe que no hay MV?? Sin mencionar que si es un video de "coreografía" es pésimo 😫 Las tomas no son claras, los acercamientos son demasiado, no deja que se aprecie la coreografía No entiendo, pero no me gusta. Su equipo de trabajo debió hacerlo mejor, así a su debut le iría mejor!! Que pena :(
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 vamossssssss
Let’s go 1M❤❤❤❤❤
Keep streaming guys
Me encanta este re-debut, luego de escuchar la canción entera me gustó mucho más y sin duda este concepto les queda mucho mejor <3
That was so good but why is it only 2 minutes?
OK, I might just not be familiar with how JYP does things but this feels really stupid, especially for a song about this where they’re singing about money and having such a low budget that they can’t even have a music video like there was so much hype around them. It feels like they could’ve had a really good video and they just fumbled
its been a whole day and the MV is still not released!😭
And that song is way too short
i hope they'll be more active in the future
Necesitamos un MV oficial
Make us wait and giving us 2 minute songs are wild
알고리즘이 날 여기로 이끌었다.. 신인인가?
It feels weird listening to the first chorus cuz I’m so used to the second since I heard it countless times before debut
i like it, but i still can’t get over the fact that JYP treats them horribly. (to our knowledge)
Ameei
Hasta parece que las miembros fueron obligadas a cambiar su imagen y parecerse a algo que no son con tal de encajar en el cual sea el nuevo concepto que pensó JYP para ellas.
liberenlas 😢
JYP confirma lo poco que le importa este proyecto. Pésimo trabajo de cámara, no captan apropiadamente a las miembros ni la coreografía. Parece un video barato hecho por un amateur, sin mencionar que las miembros pudieron hacerlo mejor. Me atrevo a decir que este grupo no lograra destacar y sera de los peores de JYP, sera para olvido. JYP es buena para arruinar a sus grupos.
This is soooo much better than i thought it would be ❤❤❤😭💅
This a 2000s BOP this Little Mix, 5H tea is what they deserve👏🏼 I can see them releasing something like Wasabi in the future or Work from Home. Gosh I am so glad you girls are back😭❤❤❤❤
Me encanto
Ves que no te funciona meter extranjeras en tus grupos y igual las metes, mejor produceles mucho mejor las canciones a tus grupos buenos que te quedan jyp.
my only complaint is about the mv 😢
YESSS
Its so good but it should be more longer pls make a extendand ver
I don't know anything about girls, but I already like them🤏🏻
❤❤❤❤
👑👑👑👑
#26 Trending 🤭😛❤🖤🤍
gonna lie, this is great!
Wow
love it!!
the mv is coming after this, right? 😢
NECESITO LOS RIZOS DE SAVANNA POR FAVOOR
MV POR FA
MVはどこ？？
the budget😢😢😢
My bias was kaylee but now its legit savanna
I am sorry, but I have to point this out. But at certain moments. They are not going with the song track for the vocals. They are just making facial expressions or stop lipsyncing. I know dancing and singing is not easy. But they aren’t singing. Just lipsyncing the words and they didn’t even do it. (lipsync) At one point Camila just stopped lipsyncing the high note line. I understand this is a choreography video and not a live performance but I just don’t see it. Other than that, I love the song and Choreo.
Savvanna girl you legit
Girlset is mindsett
Sotyyy
My girlies are eating
We were waiting for thissss
Creo que el nuevo grupo global de chicas de HYBE va a romperla más que este grupo. No se ofendan, pero con esto JYP confirma la mala compañía que es para promocionar a sus grupos. Tal parece que ya ni les importa el grupo. En cuanto termine su contrato bye bye! Debieron hacer disband porque si siguen así solo les espera el fracaso.
I love you 😍
Ngl I’m so excited to see Kendall again!
えーーーVCHAから名前が変わってたんだ〜 このコンセプト合ってるよね！めちゃくちゃカッコいいし、歌もダンスも凄くレベルが上がってる⤴︎ なんか、、お帰りなさーい！！おめでとう🎉
MY JAW IS ON THE FLOOR???   First of all, the vocals are FREAKING AMAZINGGGGGGG!  The choreo is top tier like honestly I’m so gaggedddddddd!  The outfits are perfffffff!  & the girls are so beautiful like I’m so happy for what’s to comeeee🤗
Where is the mvv
QUEENS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
yall why am i replaying this
Oh snap.  They really did that.  They dont feel like the came out of the kpop machine (nothing wrong with that)  It legit feels like  just a girl group. Theyre so good. I always thought they were skilled. But this is crazy. Way to go girls. They look so sure of themselves and confident
She’s giving Anita vibes but I’m here for it lol they look cute
JYP needs to start spendin some money on them, where's the MV!?
この4人が大好きなのは大前提、なにより曲が好きすぎる！！
Can one help me i love a20 may and atheart music. but how does a20 have 36 million views but only 70k likes and atheart have 36k likes and 15 million views. how do they have more views than girlset. Girlset have 87k likes and only 750k views
Vamos por esos 800 k de vistas
They all shine in this songs ... 😮😮😮
I don't understand the meaning of the song. Could someone explain what "being commas " mean?
WOOO TRENDING TOP 30!!!
estaba mejor Vcha :c
jyp ????? este es el dance practice
lol such a joke. Where is the actual nv
They did good though
What happened to the 6 of them
they ate, but i need a album with proper promotions!!!
Hopefully there’s a music video for this!!! This song, although short, is absolute fire!! This genre and vibe absolutely fits them and damn did they slay this!! The girl are back, better than ever!! They deserve all the hype and success!! 🔥❤️
No esta mal pero es una canción demasiado corta y para un redebut, bien tacaño jyp al no darles un verdadero MV... En fin, apoyando a las chicas porque ellas estan aquí y han luchado por este redebut ❤
NECESITO EL MV
Ya se me pegó la música
They are slaying the music 🥰🥳 slay
Katseye wannabe
I wonder how r Kaylee and KG😔
Grabaron la coreografía con la calculadora de las twice?  Psdt:Que le hicieron a los chinos de savanna? 💔
6명이 이 노래 부를 예정이었는데 2명이 탈퇴함....mv도 이미 찍었을 텐데 공개 할 수가 없겠지...그러니 이번 노래는 그냥 안무영상으로 대체하는 듯....kg 그 배신자 때문에 남은 4명이 고생이 많다
si jyp invirtiera lo mismo con este grupo, como lo hace con twice, ganarían mucho…
trending #27 🔥🔥👏👏
Wow! Eu amei!! <3
came out 23 hours ago with 736k views!! Im so happy their back and this choreo eats
i love thiis
とても素敵な4人だと思うから、絶対にこれからヒットして欲しいな😢❤❤ 応援してます！ JYPは彼女たちのサポートを全力でお願いします！
Love it this song 🎉❤
It’s a great song !!!
Wish the song was longer though
All of them are just like a baddies when kg and Kaylee is not in the group
Kendall look more like a baddie
Love them!!!
asi se ven mejor
DAYUMM THIS IS FIRE
Little Mix vibesssss ❤
Can the camera back up 😂😂😂
❤
Love to see them healthy ❤❤❤
choreography ATE ❤❤❤
COMO NO VAN A TENER MV
おかえりなさい！！パワフルでかっこいい歌声の中にケンダルのかわいい声がアクセントになっていていいね！
THIS IS SO GOOD IM SO PROUD OF YOU GIRLSET
Dios JYO CTM PENSÉ QUE ERA UN MV, SIEMPRE DANDO MIGAJAS 😒😒😒
Kendall is a bad singer
Eu por um segundo: Anitta? Entrei no vídeo certo?
Soy su fan ❤❤❤
katseye effect
This actually eats, love this for them!!
I’m so proud of you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every time i watch this, i notice & appreciate even more things. They killed this!
I keep coming back! Stuck in my head!
I really want to hear the songs they wrote!
Pre debut?
Están tan calientes🫦
I'm so sorry yall, i was so excited for this but I feel like its a bit underwhelming 😭
Lexi and Savanna's vocals have gotten so good! Camila and Kendall rocking it as always! This ahjumma approves. 🤩🥰
OMG I LOVE YOU GIRLS
this is unlistenable and so short, jyp, please, make justice for this girls.
SLAY
Damnnnnnnn, ayyeeeeee
Best rebrand
I hope they're safe now and not doing it as the past with Vcha u.u And.. i need to see this song in live e.e to see the improve singing
OMG THEY ATE SO HARD
0:12 yeh I have waited and I need more
Who are they?  They're amazing!!!
会えない間も進化をし続けてくれてありがとうm(__)m❤ ❤❤みんな大好き❤❤
My only complaint about this is that it’s so short 😭💔
I'm SAT for Girlset re-debut 🤩
#26 trending!!!
If they got an actual mv they could have done crazy numbers bc their voices and performance is insane
we need mv 😭😭😭😭
first listen and OMGGG I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!!!!
BUT WHAT!? Where is the MV!!
These 4 look so good together.
This coregraphy have to reach 10M views
Trying to get my youtube premium
HERE SINCE A2K!!!!
this song is literally crack I keep coming back to it
​@JYPEntertainment i really like the song and the beat, but the INTRO is too short.
They ATE!
SPEND SOME MONEY
Who is the camera man? Fire them.
Amazing song ❤
Flop ..all JYP GG FLOP 😂😂
Oh
Girlset girlies are the definition of star quality and stage presence. It's in their blood. And they keep on improving like the rent is due. The song is good though feels a little rushed and imo needed more verses in between the chorus. It kinda leaves you hungry. And that's not good. Also where is the mv? Jyp seriously needs to put up their game rn or the opportunity may be lost forever for Girlset. My girls deserve so much better. Also i hope to hear more vocals, high notes or adlibs, cause the girls would eat it up!
Omg!! They are so talanted!
porque solo 2 minutos? JYP echale ganitas papi que las niñas tienen 1 año en las sombras y no sera justo que al rato las presionen con tener exito cuando ellas le echan ganas pero falta que JYP quiera que si triunfen y no esten como SM con SUJU alla por el 2006
Ameeee
Don't try to make another kateseye ok jyp😒
Que pasaaaaa?? la empresa deberia darle más atención al grupo. Ellas tienen mucho potencial!!!
Nobody gaf
Cool
Wow this is way better than when they were vcha👀👀 (i still miss kg tho)
YAAAAASSSS
I feel like the song is lacking more, the shift from the pre chorus to chorus is too harsh. Even if this isn’t tittle track it should be better as their debut single. The girls were gone for over a year, we and they deserve more. I will keep supporting them because they deserve it, but I hope JYPE does better for them and doesn’t hide them again if they don’t have immediate success
Vamo mis amores 🫂
We need an MV
This is new era of Vcha,Now are GirlSet
Jyp wth there’s a lens smudge near Camila in the opening. These girls deserve soooo much more.
YALLL ATEEEE OMGGGG
Whoot whoot let's reach 1 mil
It's giving me American version of Miss A-- visuals and sound wise which i loveeee
Favorite girlset member??
This is too short 😭
JYP PRECISA APRENDER A DIVULGAR SEUS GRUPOS DIREITO!!! URGENTEMENTE!!!
OKAY they absolutely ate this, I love the direction they're going now (even though i still enjoyed their music before!). JYP better not fuck it up
Estoy reamando esta canción.
ISSO SUPEROU MINHAS EXPECTATIVAS
Woow they’re good
I don't know this group but, 😮
❤❤❤❤❤
We missed you a looooot❤❤❤❤❤
From A2K > VCHA > GIRLSET ❤️❤️❤️ Supporting this girls through out the way!!  We need the MV @JYPEntertainment
Too short but I like it better than vcha songs
🕳️💣
I’m back for the 100th time. IM OBSESSED!!!
ONCE here to support GIRLSET!💋
Me gustó muuuuucho más de lo que esperaba, espero les den más producción.
Keep str3aming
Who been here since A2K? LOVE THESE GIRLS
Mds a ruiva e filha da Anitta
I am so happy to see you back I have missed you all so much!!!🥹😭❤️❤️
SO SO PROUD OF YOU GIRLS THIS IS AMAZINGGG
En definitiva muy Icónicas 🖤
So we're only gonna get a choreo MV and 1 live stage? JYP taking his sweet time promoting them....yeah right! He needs to do a better job promoting them
めちゃくちゃかっこいいです！
AY POR😊 DIOS ME RE MUEROOO LSS RE ADORO REINAS
OMGGGGGGG I LOVEEEE
❤❤❤❤❤
It took me a hot second to realize that these were the girls from VCHA, wow
To be honest خياس
JYP LISTEN TO THE LYRICS SPEND SOME MONEY (on my girls) !!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
So great ❤❤❤❤❤
Moooore
OMGGGGGGG ITS SOOOOOO GOOD
Come on vocals!! Y’all did that 👏👏👏we need more
mejor ni saquen musica, q es esto dios
wish the song was longer, but other than that I love this rebrand 😭😭
I thought they are new I never imagined VCHA members can do this
Seems like they rushed the girls just  to catch the global girl group hype that’s happening right now (especially after seeing Katseye do so well). I was expecting a lot more for this music video but at least their vocals sound amazing.
They are amazing!!😊
THIS IS A GREAT REBRAND
Já sou FanSet✨ (nome de fandom criado por mim)

Girlset please concerttt
Omg yes slayyyy
Lexi❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

O descaso e o desrespeito com o grupo é impressionante, seja com o nome que for. Quando você acha que a jyp não consegue fazer pior ela vai lá e se supera, espero que essas meninas fiquem livres
Camila❤❤❤❤❤❤
Savanna❤❤❤❤❤
素晴らしい💖生のパフォーマンスが早くみたいな
I wasn't expecting how good this song was going to be 😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤
TREND$ETTERS WERE NUMBER #24 ON TRENDING 🗣️
Not skipping ads so the girls can get out of debt 😭🙏🙏
JYP le tiene miedo al exito? Y el MV? Y la plata? Por fin dan lo que tanto esperabamos y lo dan a las malas, pilas pues!!
M4ney on me
So much ❤❤❤❤
❤
Definitivamente son muy buenas pero jyp no les da lo que realmente se merecen
Necesito el video musical
Kizlarin diğer iki üyelerine olanlardan sonra kariyer istemeleri ne kadar nmantikli ulan kariyer istiyorsanız bile bunu jyo de yapmak zorunda değilsin tamam jyp diğer şirketler içinde en masumu ama bu onun da kötü tarafları olduğu anlamına değiştirmez kızları anlamıyorum cidden
YESSS WHATS 4 + 4 ???
amo este concepto
Love it!❤
no entiendo pq jype planeó seguir con las chicas de vcha con otro redebut si ni siquiera se iba a tomar el tiempo de darles un mv y promocionarlas como se debe. Las chicas son grandes, lo tienen absolutamente todo para triunfar, pero jype no lo aprovecha. Creo que uno de los motivos por los cuales las personas se enteraron de su redebut con girlset fue por los tiktoks que ellas subían con su nueva canción no por algún tipo de promoción por parte de jype 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ pero igual la canción está buenísima, espero que triunfen a futuro. girlset sigue siendo igual de bueno como alguna vez lo fue vcha ❤
ATEE LETSGO GIRLSET ! ! ❤
Wait is their name not vcha anymore?
Sizi çok seviyorummm
Grupo nuevo 😃 Y de sorpresa 🎉
❤
Money on me GİRLSET

JYP vale popo
Thank you latrice🙏🏽
❤❤
IM SO PROUD OF THEM AS A GIRL WHO STANNED VCHA💗💗 THIS CONCEPT FITS THEM SO MUCH MORE
i was just watching A2K💔
Do yall think they have a mv
🙀👍
my girls ❤
New fan❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
This is so gooddddd
PERFEITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
Siento que desperdician mucho la voz de Camila, y la parte del coro parece como pegada encima de la canción, más pensada para que funcione en TikTok. Sé que hoy en día es normal que muchos grupos hagan sus coros así, pero tampoco hay que abusar, JYP. No es hate, soy fan de ellas desde predebut,el problema es más bien la empresa. La canción en sí está buena y las chicas lo hacen muy bien.
GREAT SONG AND EXCELENT PERFORMANCE .
I'm addicted already 😭 I had lower expectations ngl but they really ate. their vocals are being more showed (?) like I'm finally hearing all the members vocals clearlier. (miss kaylee and kg 😓) BUT I loved commas !! these girls ate !!!
JYP releasing everything but a M/V
Well what the heck Lexi only had like 3 words 😭
Love ittt
WATCHING 100 TIMES NOW 🥰😍❤️
Girls you are not failures at all if this doesn’t get more views, you’re all so incredibly talented it’s crazy
Видеооператор помешан на портретной съёмке?
Woah,The vocal improvements is insane. GIRLSET Let’s go!!!!
Wow, can't stop listening to the song.
jyp가 만들고 싶었지만 한국에서는 할 수 없었던… 이제야
waittt this song is good
GIRLSET COMING SOON !!! YEAH
Is this the official MV? I’m so confused. JYP hyped us for nothing. I mean the girls all look good, the song is catchy too but the MV is so underwhelming 😢
Me suena a una canción el coro pero no se a cual 😩
The song actually was divaaa
I'm crying😭
カッコいいー！！！待ってたよ！！！
El vocal, sonido, atuendos, coreografia y visual es bastante atractivo, felicidades por el regreso!! Girlset
Lol im loving their boob shaking choreo moments. it looks so funny but they do it well that it works?! it wouldnt look right if i did it, thats for sure
JYP, SPEND MONEY ON GIRLSETT
Imagine this potential but gave rhem that shitty VCHA concept
これでええんよ
❤❤
期待しすぎちゃいけないんだろうけど、再生回数が多ければ他のバージョンのMVも公開されるのではと期待して昨日から何度も聴いてます。 ループ再生はダメなんですよね？詳しい方いたら教えて欲しいです。
I'm trying to find something nice to say .....  I got nothing .
これからが楽しみ☺️🫶🏻 ブランディング次第でビックなグループになれると思う‼️
Yall where's the real mv and this looks rlly low quality
I’m sorry, but that was absolute garbage—so generic and uninspired, I can’t fathom why they thought this song would bring anyone back. And it’s barely over two minutes long—2:03, almost a full minute shorter than a normal track. Seriously, who exactly is this song even for, and what on earth is supposed to be appealing about it?  The line “YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ME, LOOKING AT ME LIKE YOU WANNA...” was beyond annoying. Was this really the best they could come up with? It sounds like a desperate attempt that fell flat.  Nine people wrote and produced this mess. Nine! Let that sink in.  If this is the level of their work now, they might have had a better shot sticking to their Disney Channel wannabe vibe than releasing this embarrassing excuse for a song.
GIRLSET IS THE MINDSETTTTT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
KG….not the same
Why sounds so good😭🫶
Okay so a weird itzy lsf mix kind of sound. Im not mad...
All four are incredible.
That was disappointing
Lexi is everythinggg😩🤧
ahhh i loveee them so exited for there futureee songss
Love it!❤
Nos falta 400 k para el millón ❤❤
Okay Okay I love it already 😮
They comeback strong
where’s the actual video?
This is like a global group from JYP?
This is so good I’m shook
Luvvv
I thought JYP will released an mv of this song but instead, a choreography video, the song is good but only one set...? JYP, treat the girls better soon...
JYP YOU DID NOT SPEND ENOUGH MONEY ON GIRL SET. THE EXIT SIGN IN THE UP RIGHT CORNER?! COMMON MAN YOU CAN AFFORD MORE THAN A CHANGING ROOM MY GUY
PERIODD!!!!!
I don’t get it where’s the mv…..
I didn’t wait all this long for this 😢😢 jyp treat them better!!! They deserve the world and more ❤
This song not great and forgettable. JYP bad lately with non banger songs. The styling outfits are bad…some of these girls are flat chested and a tube top would have been best. Lexi needs to tone/lean up to match the body vibes of the other members. Note: TF i can comment on bodies, nothing you can do about it
With a long awaited teaser, this is the *Official* video? One camera in a dressing room? C'MON! JYP didn't spend some money on them , money on them, some money on them.... JYP do better this time!
Ok purrrrrr work miss things
DIVAS ATE
みんな大好き❤待っててよかった🥹これからも活躍が楽しみ！
Elas estão lindas demais❤
Nem parece que um dia elas foram o Vcha
That's vcha
Commas 🤭😍👌🏾
YASSSS GIRLSSSSS
PERIODT OMGGGGGG
ATE GURLSSSSS
i feel like there’s a disconnect between the chorus and the rest of the song
Ate
At the end of the day they slayed this OUT
My bias is Camilla and she killed it!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
linda❤❤❤
❤❤❤
“These girls are so incredible, I loved Commas.” 🌟💜
I AM AADDICTED TO SONG
Wow! WOW! Eu tava dando nada por esse rebranding, tá maravilhoso!
Keep str3aming the mv!!! This is not yhe offcial mv...this is the choreo version...this is the reintroduction for previous fans and new comers....they want to build a solid fanbase...so please support
My eternal vcha :(, I love you girls❤
On fire ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Savanna's forehead:its my time to shine!
this is lowkey IVE coded
Slayed
Is this a new group?
I had to come back, I'm OBSESSED with Lexi
i really liked this!!
The budget is so low. They need more.
😮😮😃🤩🤩 OOoo!!! JYP is has made a diverse, English singing group?! C'mon international superstars!
This group and this song looks so cheap😭😭😭
Its mv oficcial or mv coreo? Ate girlset
ITZY would have rooooock that song, not these nugu group
The girl with red hair is so divaa 🤭💅
Está increíble la canción
YESSSS ❤
Las amooo

CAMILLA? KENDALL???

Omg the song is AMAZING Jyp??? WHY YOU DOIN THEM SO DIRTYY TFF
where’s the MV this is js a performance video🙁
THIS EATS
OMGGGG
Ohh this is awful (Not the music, its actually amazing asf, but  jyp is AWFUL)
The music video cost them 100$ 🤣
All this build up and no actual MV?
WE NEED AN ACTUAL MV PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE😮‍💨❤
Just figured out this group and so proud to have a Hmong representative. I hope this group goes big
❤
Why is this js a choreography video where’s the mv
I'm so happy that they are back with a different concept
I missed kendall. She is a PERFORMER!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
welcome girlset ❤
The girls ate but we need an mv. Like tomorrow 😢❤❤❤❤
Omg I’m actually obsessed with
She recommended this video to me and I fell in love. They are beautiful, and the subject matter is incredible, it's still in my head!🔥🫦
와 진짜 다들 실력 엄청 늘었다 잘 되면 좋겠네 화이팅
Spend some money on me I like hummus
This can't be the whole song. It's barely 2 minutes!
Q SAUDADE DELASSS, TRISTE PELO FIM D VCHA MAS ELAS ESTÃO TÃO LINDAS A MSC TÁ PERFEITA DIVASSSSS VÃO TER SUCESSO DMSSS COMO JÁ TINHAM
Ang gondo ❤
I honestly love thissss
This song is good and their vocals served but what I usually don't like in girl group is usually the too much of skin exposure I mean a girl can still look cool without showing too much of their skin but overall great song 😊❤
FINALLYYYY
OMGGGGGGGG 😭♥️
No se ofendan pero esto está mucho mejor que Katseye literal
THEY👏ALL👏ATE👏
get a mv
We need views Once an hour should help
Low budget af
so much excitement just because of the choreography? 😢😢❤❤❤
LETS GO GIRLSET!! SHOW THEMM WHAT U GOT!! U GO GIRLSSS!!
Las amooo
Regresaron les espera mucho exito
Me encantó ,necesito que sigan con este concepto
Need the mv!!
It's finally back! Oh my god! I've been waiting for over a year! Almost, it's finally back in August 2025! 😭👏
now the mv video won’t get that much views, hope i’m wrong tho. 🤦‍♀️
Necesitamos el video musicaaaaaaal
Necesito un MV
beautiful
Este es el inicio de algo grande
I'm just glad they came back, I know they can make it big one day🥺 also the song fits them so well, the talent is oozing here and there~
DAMNNN
guys don’t forget this is just an choreo version performance video not an official mv comeback. i think jyp is testing the water first.
OHHHHHHHHH
めちゃくちゃいい！！！ コンセプトもスタイリングも曲も全部好き😍  第二のブラックピンクっぽさを感じた！✨ かっこいいも可愛いもセクシーもいる！！  カミラからはリサ、サブリナからはジェニ、レクシーからはモモ味を感じた！ケンダルは、美人さの中に可愛い要素が多めに詰まってて他に例えられない唯一無二感…！（つまり最強チーム✨）
🤏🏽🤏🏽🤏🏽
I don’t like the chorus
I'm so glad to see they're back❤❤
❤
0:15 And 0:55 are so angelical
Y’all MV is coming out later
Honestly, this song is more than i expected and im glad ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Uwwww
LEXIIIIIIIIIII?!??!?!?!?! 😮😮😮
SVANNA SE PARECE A ANITTA CON EL CABELLO LACIO
Better than before bro
Camerawork is diabolical
🔥🔥🔥
This is not kpop, GET OUT
Camila es demasiado perciosa!!! 😍😍😍😍 Lexi, Savana, Kendall!! 🥰🥰
This is a really shit
Ngl this lowk flopped
Love this song. Wished it was longer. This is the start of a new beginning. I am proud of these girls. ❤🔥
whatt this is so good!
Espero que está vez si les vaya muy bien, es demasiado pegajosa y la coreografía también 💘
Cadê o mv ?
OMG IM NOT GONNA LIE TO YALL I WAS KIND OF SCARED OF WHAT THIS SONG WAS GONNA SOUND LIKE BCZ OF THE CHORUS BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY KINDA GOOD⁉️
SCREAMING
Dang It’s actually good I’m sorry for doubting yall 😭
There will always be dissatisfied people or people who will say that they are copying Kateyes. I don't think so. The song is catchy, the choreography is catchy, and their vocal have improved.
poor girls, given this song and concept....they look like knock-off katseye
Parece que fue filmado en un ropero...oh JYP si no quieres invertir en este grupo solo déjalo ir. Estás niñas aún pueden estudiar una buena carrera en vez de esperarte
these girls are the gateway to success
Estoy obsesionada con esta canción
who are them???
The song is very good but I felt like it was missing something, the girls' voices are too incredible for the song to only last 2 minutes. The fact that it's not an MV as such also takes away points :/
OMG THE CHOREOGRAPHY IS SO GOOODDDD
Ateee ❤️🥵
OMFG WE WAITED SO LONG FOR A CHOREO VID? I HOPE THEYRE FINE WITH IT. and only two minutes??😭😭 Love the song tho
DEBERIAN PONER LA TRADUCCION EN CASTELLANO EN EL VIDEO!!! POR FAVOR
LAS AMO HOLA
おかえり! ここからまた新しい章が始まると思うとワクワクする!
Mmmmh no me provocó nada pero cool
They devoured
this is so good the vocals everythig camila and lexi omgggg😍
EXITOS!!!!! LAS AMOOOOOO GIRLSET
❤ ◇ Buena combinación ◇ 🖤
Girls… 🫦
So chill song! I like it
I love this group name much more🙏
Temazo
Если бы не невозможное продвижение от джупа, это могло бы стать очень-очень популярным. 🙏❤
this giving like a performance video😭
OMGG
I'm like so obsessed, actually, holy crap
i missed them
JYP is joker
Foi uma divulgação grande pra vir com isso?? JYP cadê o investimento??
QUE GUAPASSSS😍😍
yessssss❤
YESSSSSSS
Anittaaa??
That wasn’t a request JYPE. Please spend some damn money on them for my sanity 💀😂
this is not MV but a performance video 😭
I love it ❤️🥺
I THINK i GET it why THEY DROPPED the CHOREOGRAPHY ver 1st  CAUSE SOME had DOUBTS about the DANCE that it DOESN'T fit the SONG THAT MUCH ....EXT 🎶  THEY ARE LIKE JUST LOOK HERE U ARE !!!! IT FITS JUST WATCH AND STFU  MY OPINION
❤
From tallest to shortest BAHAH 2:02
i'm rooting for them HARDDDDDD
The growth of this 4 ladies is very much amazing..
WOAH CLOCK ITTT
𝙸𝚜 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝙼𝚅??? 𝙸 𝚍𝚘𝚗'𝚝 𝚞𝚗𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚍
That’s actually good
Esperaba más,aún así apoyaré :/
We’re is the mv
The song is fire🔥
SAVANNA❤ i LOVE this group ❤
I'm sorry but in my eyes they don't really look happy. especially Camilla. It feels like something is off ( no hate) But the song is fire!!🔥
The girls are talented but this sing is ALL OVER THE PLACE 😢
Light up this 2025 Girlset!
THEYY ATEEEE
dressed like tacky dancers, asking to be spent money on, gosh it is so tacky.
Jyp give me your number you forget something please i wanna to remembered you
so goood
I’m beyond obsessed!
Y mi MV!?
They are the prettiest girl group!!!
that's the way to go!
speechless, better say the best song❤❤❤❤❤
Jyp, i’m so disappointed. when vcha became girlset i was really excited because they were coming back and then the photos came out and i thought they looked AMAZING but then you spoiled the whole chorus to the point where it was so annoying, and now when we finally get the music video, it’s not even a real music video, the song is so short and the whole song is just these two verses over and over again. And there was like nothing promoting this, one trailer, photos and some tiktoks. you need a better marketing team for these girls afuckingsap.
cheap
THAT SO CUTE KANDELL
RAWRRRR
❤❤
🎉🎉
yessss
Whooo wanna rock with Jennie? 🎶
Porque criticar, es apoyarlas si son fans, la empresa toma sus decisiones por algo. Otros grupos de la empresa empiezan igual, diferentes conceptos pero siempre con sueños, esperanza y entregando todo. Respetemos ❤
OMG Savannah 🥰
WHERE IS THE MV??????????? JYP IS THIS REALLY THE MV? 😭 WE'VE BEEN WAITING AND THERE SO MUCH THAT HAPPEND EVEN GIRLSET REBRANDED BUT WHY IS IT LIKE THIS??????
This "MV" is too long we need more shorter than this!!! Like 1:01mins duration for MVs in 2025-2099
We need the mv
I knew i heard something familiar in this, this got Tommy´s hand all over it. I love!!! It´s really giving 5h´s little sister.
2 minute only????  That's stupid why would they do that...
Let´s go girls!!!
Cami really ate the vocals and concept, I love!!!!
omgg
Sois increíbles chicas, me alegro que estéis de vuelta ❤😊, tenéis unas vocales increíbles, seguro que iremos descubriendo más de vuestro talento!!🎉
I’ve been supporting this group alongside Katseye and other girl bands, but… this is what I’ve been waiting for? 😂 It looks like a cheap video a first grader could’ve edited. Major letdown.😢
MV????
Jype sendo Jype, todo mundo pensando que teria mv pro DEBUT do Girlset, mas só ganhamos uma performance, a gente quer MV carambaaaaa
This so song is nice but it’s kinda underwhelming since the chorus was posted
It was really amazing, I loved the vocals and the choreography ❤️‍🔥
This looks and sounds homemade lmao
2 minutes???
I'm sorry this is ass
Ateee slayeddd mommas
Such a good song
Brooo savanna’s vocals left me speechless😭💞
Weeeee neeeeed a mvvvvvvv plz❤
Who the hell is the short hair girl, like she’s the only that doesn’t look familiar
2 things to point out  1. LEXI. Why is she so fat?  2. SAVANNA. Her make up did not suit her  Happy for the girls comeback
Grabe nabusog ako sa ganda ng vocals!!
600k❤❤ LETS REACH 1M ASAP
Commas suena comadres en español 😂
Wow ok jyp, it's actually a good English song. I'm surprised🎉
keep streaming guyssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
lets goooo 1 M!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤❤❤
We need a MV and better promotion
is this song about pay for play?
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
I LOVE GIRLSET
El sonido no lo sacaron de crazy?
WOMEN OF THE YEAR ❤❤❤
This sound like an itzy song... idk if I like it or not
Aren’t they a bit old????
❤❤
I❤❤
I'm so tired of the short song trend. I really wish this was longer! Also, really wish the CHOREOGRAPHY version showed the actual choreography, not the girls from just the bust shot of everyone for like 95% of the video. Really disappointing.
カッコ良すぎます！本当にカッコ良いです！ ありがとうございます!
Wow❤❤❤❤
最高！エンドレスで鬼リピしてます。
guys there is going to be an mv
i now makes sense why the girls were trying so hard to promote it themselves... JYPE isnt even trying for them. Anyways slay girlssss
REINAS
JYPE really doesn’t know how to produce songs, why is the mixing SO bad and the chorus so soft? They actually had potential, it makes me so mad
I think the choreo version released was kinda smart. It’s about the song and energy without all of the extra production.
MY GIRLSSSS I MISSED YOU SO MUCHHH🥹🥹🥹🥹
the whole rebrand and preparations just not not get an actual music video is crazy when they’ve all worked so hard …
How could some of you not like the song? It's great. The only thing I don't like is the chorus, but I love it for that.
Please a mv🙏🥹
Where is the MV? 😢
Close enough, welcome back Little Mix.
CADE O MV, JYP ??????
BOYCOTT THIS DISGUSTING GROUP THEY LITERALLY PUSHED TWO MINORS OUT OF A GROUP JUST BE TRASHER THAN KATSEYE
아니 왜 코레오 mv?? 진짜 뮤비를 내놔
Devoraron🎉🎉
Omg Lexi is so hot ❤
El final tan iconic
Mmm. Las chicas muy bien pero JYP, no sé. No me llego a convencer la canción. La canción esta muy corta, la verdad pense que el regreso (por parte de la empresa) iba hacer fenomenal pero creo que JYP aun no suelta el lado KPOP en girlset y desde ahí estamos un poco mmm. Siento que deberian atreverse a más sin miedo a las criticas tal vez de los internautas de su pais ya que en occidente creo que serian un boom pero sin duda deben cambiar de productor musical, compositor no sé, pero darles otra vibra.
they are taking it!!!
THEY SOUND SO GOOD
Choreography is actually FiRE but the camerawork ruined it.
THEY DID AMAZING!!!
I was going to ask who these girls are but then OMG their visuals are more stunning, i love this concept ty girls for coming back and jyp for this. I love the song <3
This concept IS savanna
soy fan desde A2K, estuve en la época de VCHA y ahora verlas como GIRLSET y sin dos integrantes se me hace muy raro 😞 pero dejando eso de lado, me sorprendió mucho sus vocales y la nota alta de Camila, han mejorado mucho y me gusta este concepto más maduro luego de perder a las maknaes, espero que JYP les de el trato y promoción que merecen y que nunca antes tuvieron, apoyaré a GIRLSET al 100% 💗
They have so much talent, they have a lot of potential, if JYP would like spend some money on them they would be successful………. Commit jyp commit
SO PROUD OF MT GIRLSSS
OKAY DIVASSSS🥰🥰🥰😍😍
i love them but i don’t think this is a good idea..
THIS GIVES ME OLD MONEY VIBES. THEY LOOKED INCREDIBLE. EVERYONE SHINED IN THEIR OWN WAY.🔥✨️
I see a lot of potential in them
Who is this band?
I really love girlset ❤
Me hacen acordar a little mix, me encantaaa❤❤❤
JADORE ❤❤❤
Congrats Lexus!! Love ya
Early
LETS GOO
Ojalá sea el inicio de muchos éxitos. Se lo merecen ❤
savanna kinda looks like anitta??
WE WANT AN MV ✊️✊️
We need a mv
This isn't the official MV. There's a short part in the teaser that includes a background not shown here.
they ate but why is it so short?!
These girls have been TRAINING 🔥
WE NEED THE MV 😔
Loveeeeeed
The girl has approved a lot and they are really mature right now so beautiful jyp need to spend a little bit more money on them, please make the mv better next one they deserve better.
Where is the mv
JYP spend some money dude !!!! we're like commas ,,,,,,,,
ok this is an actual banger, this NEEDS to go trend!
If we give them the str3Ams, would JYP give them a legit MV?
These girls delivered on this video.  I just wish JYP did.
vocals are a bit ehhh but otherwise the girls ATE DOWN
女孩你們很棒！加油加油❤
Well is fire 💓💓
LO UNICO MALO ES QUE COMENZO MAS RAPIDO, DEBERIAN DE HACER UN BUEN INICIO DE CANCION QUE ATRACTIVO Y ADICTIVO Y MANTENER LOS ESPECTADORES HASTA LA MEJOR PARTE
𝙾𝚖𝚐 𝚜𝚘 𝚌𝚞𝚝𝚎 𝚐𝚒𝚛𝚕𝚜!!?
they ate. i really hope there’s a full mv for this
Estoy decepcionada de verdad
다들 너무 예쁘고 걸크러시 스타일 완전 멋있는데 ., 노래는 살짝 아쉬운 느낌임 ㅜ 그래도 다들 케미도 좋구💕 나중엔 한국인 멤버도 합류하면 또 다른 색깔을 볼수있을까싶네
This song sounds a bit outdated. Sounded like Lady Gaga's 2010 music. I don't know if it was intentional or not. But I still support them.
El teaser parecia un mv el que mostrarian, sera que tuvieron problemas para subirlo o estaran poniendo en prueb al público
Yay. No more high school musical songs. This is your genre. And you ladies ate! Lexi is my bias!
The song slaps, but it’s too short
LES EXTRAÑE CHICAS TAN LINDAS, BRILLANDO SIEMPRE, PERO NECESITAMOS EL M/V REAL 😭😭❤❤❤❤
Brabo chics cigan adelante ❤❤❤❤
Besties, let’s stream nonstop! 💖✨ GirlSet’s debut deserves 1M views, let’s make it happen together! 🎶💫
This doesn’t look like it’s from a big 3 company at all what is JYP doing
Like KATSEYE, they’re getting the choreography of prostitutes.
KEEP THE STREAMS COMINGG
AHHHH😍😍😍
Gurlss
It feels like jyp noticed Katseye's success and decided to replicate it. That's it.
So Excited was waiting for thisss !!!! 🎊🎊🎊
Welcome back ladies!! 😄👏👏 We have been waiting! Congrats!
Why's there not an actual MV
GOTTA BE A BOP 🔥🔥!!
I'm enjoying this whole Little Mix/Fifth Harmony 2018 girl group vibe a lot! This direction makes a lot more sense for the group
Only one set?
Wtf
GIRLSET CVNT OH MY GODDD
they really took advantage that there’s no minor in the group now…
They definitely ate and slay, but we need more of these talented girls and they definitely deserve it more, don't waste their passion and talent because that would be a crime.
Bro made us wait for so much just to not even give them a mv
WHO IS HERE BEFOR 1M VIEWS?
KENDALL ❤❤
How sad the video aint even HD and the room was so bad. They deserve so much better!
trashy  lyrics 😕 and ''choreography'' video
YESSS❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥⭐⭐
Omg i felt in love with them
Wow Lexi's vocals are vocalingggg!! We need more of her omg! She barely had any lines! The choreography is 🔥 af! Girlset, I like I like! ❤
This song is so good!!! I need more music from them now!!!
Me gustaba más el concepto del grupo cuando era Vcha,
No entiendo
THIS IS SO GOOD BUT TOO SHORT 😭😭😭
I NEED THE MV!!❤️🔥
More
DIOS QUE CANCIÓN TAN BUENA ME MUERO
nailedd ittt toooooooo goooood
I think this might be their best song yet. Good job Girlset.
Is jyp set to ruin this group ? To have an excuse to stop giving them anything?? Because why is this before the MV? And why is it too short? And why just a single?
I LOVE YOU GIRLSET!!!😭🫶🏻
0:22 what is her name? im in love with her vocals such a unique voice
Pega duro y no es necesario más tiempo porque está bien estructurado
OMG THIS SONG IS SO GOOD I LOVE IT 😍
Gangnam girl's anthem 😭😭
where is the budget?😞
Spend some money on them, money on them they're like commas
Please what the fandom gonna be called can't wait omg 👏👏🤏
They planned,cooked,backed,tasted and eat *period*
Great performance, amazing vocals, beautiful team, good song but JYP and others please spend some money on them.
The song is ok, but the mv is not ok
they need a new team behind them fr
oxe gente a anitta tá na jyp?
I love the song! This new look, theme and vibe is so much better guys! I’m rooting for yall! This the cold girl winter anthem!! Make them pockets hurt!💅🏾
กุอวยอยู่😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
Just me wondering: -Kendall the raper  -savanna and lexi the vocals -camilla always the vocal queen
All that hype for a 2 minute song and not an actual MV? And the verses didn’t even flow well compared to the chorus? JYP what is going on????
No cuz this are in like 2 minutes😭😭
THE VOCALS ?! What ?!!
SAVANNAAAA THE IMPROVEMENT?
Lexi bias wrecked so hard she’s my bias now😭😭
I think they will become my favorite group. What perfect vocals ❤️🎀
Periodddd
OH MY GOSH YAYYYYY THIS IS SO GOODDDDD. IM LIKE COMMASSSS
Vocals and Visuals 🫢🔥
Lexi is so underated... she dances so well, sings so well, are extremelly beautiful ans sweet. GO, GIRLS
18 saat önce. Sadece yorumumu koymak istedim ilk şarkıları diye . Acaba iyi iş mi çıkacaklar yoksa kötü mü bilemem . Şarkı ve konsepti çok iyi gözüküyor. Ama yani her zamanki gibi o şirin ve kız vardı Asyalı ona  çok üzülüyorum sadece bu grubu gördüğümde o aklıma geliyor o kadar. Neyse bay bay
What the f is that? Why don't they deserve a normal mv? Girlset are very talented and have great potential but jyp, as usual, loses all chances. I hope the company will understand why Katseye is at the peak of popularity, and Girlset (Vcha in the past) is again stuck in teenage pop
I loved🎉
wheres the actual MV..
lol so no actually mv ? What a laugh
❤❤❤
𝐽𝑦𝑝 𝑊𝑒 𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑀/𝑣
we miss old vcha
we miss old vcha
should've just set these girls free to live their lives as soloists or get normal jobs, now we've got another mid group under jyp.
Sus voces se escuchan tan poderosas, me encantan ❤
GIRLSET,NO ,IS VCHA AND NO KAYLIE AND NO SE QUIEN
What I love especially about this song is that everyone got a part to shine on with their amazing Vocals and I'm here for that!! This song fire 🔥💯
0:57 LEXI HIT THAT RUN BAEEE
1:09 UGHHH YESSS
THE VOCALS IM STILL IM SHOCK
I just don't understand why the performance video was released first. Is this the official video?
to see their growth is crazy, they are full idols now. your hard work pays off!! well done!!
Jyp subele la duración a la canción jaja está buena
its better then what vchna used to release I have to admit hope the other girls are taking good care of themselves lets go girlset
When does the mv come out?
this song is a$$ sorry
Been streaming for an hour now, you gave some people premium please give me too😢
Sorry pero esto me suena a vibras de kpop de antes, esta como reciclado. No es hate
i love them
Is this a new girl group? They slayed
Why does it look low budget?
Kendall really fits this concept like omg, she used to be my least fav but like Damnnn
YES NO KIDZ BOP SONGS
❤❤❤ mucho talento y potencial!
This is giving a typical JYP song
ta bien
KENDALL????? YOUR VOICE IMPROVED GIRLLL
Pues le doy un 5/10
ok but wheres the mv 😭
The styling or the makeup makes them look soo much older esp for Camila and Savanna..
AHHH AMAZING OMG, I LOVE IT 🙌 ACTUALLY ATE
I love thiiiiis❤
THE OUTFITS OMFGGGG
thought we were getting an my but this is lowk good
LETS REACH ATLEAST 2M UNTIL SEPTEMBER Y’ALL
They kinda gagged with this one
que música rui
itzy ot4 era vibes
QUE MUSICA FODAAAAA
Это что? Ужасная работа камеры, какая-то тряска, постоянный ближний ракурс без полноты картины, ни смены кадров, ни-че-го! Дизлайк
MEEEEOOO, EU AMEEEEI
1:40 i was 😮
😡😡😡😡🙄
This was actually so good! I honestly didn't know what to expect, but the growth is evident!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Parece de baja calidad, pero la canción está muy buena, a un que es un coreografía o perfomance nose
THIS IS ACTUALLY SO GOOD, THIS CONCEPT MAKES THEM JUSTICE
HELLLL YEAAAAAA
Me da vibes de Itzy
Stream commas guysssss The queens have returned with a banger ❤❤❤❤❤
It's only 13' hours out and I'm already addicted!! Wish it was longer song❤ Give these talented girls some love they worked hard for this one.
no one wants a new gg with a racist ass member lmao this is so pathetic
The grew up so well, stan Girlset
was the mv scrapped or what? the teaser looked like it had mv scenes rather than performance ones
1:39 HELLO CAMI UR CRAZY
OMG MY GIRLS ARE SO GORGEOUS BEAUTIFUL SONGG I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! BANGERRRR
We need to talk abt my favorite savannah and her amazing vocals
THEYRE SO TALENTED
🎉🎉🎉🎉 omg i love it
new girl group?
Jyp no sabe darle el espacio que merecen sus artistas lit que mal Jyp.
OMGG
おかえりなさーーい！
Dónde está el MV? 😢😮
OH MY GODDD! MY GIRLS SLAYY
YASSSS!
Yessss
They have improved so much guys
this is not their title track right? like... it's good but JYP can do WAY better. I'm only talking about the song, the girls slayed what they were given.
Whit that style Savanna looks like Anitta from Brazil 👁️👄👁️
어우 흠잡을데가 없네
Damnnnn, jyp u wrong for that. I can’t believe u made us wait for yrs for this??? The girls are talented enough for you to spend enough money AND TIME for a proper music video. U literally had them working their but to make contents and promote this song, and as a fan I thought the music video was gonna be like freaking Beyoncé’s mv or itzy’s mv, but thisss??!! U had them dancing in a room!! Not outside, not in a crowd or in a club or something, not even infront of a good looking building or fountain, just a room. Bloody no!! This is unacceptable!!!!
AS a katseye Stan I cant lie GIRLSET ate with this one I'm immediately stanning
OMGG THIS IS PERFECT
Can we get 1m!
Ended katseye 😭😭😭😭😭😭 yesssss this is what we needed!!!! Hybe should take notes like why are they already making other flop groups YOU GUYS ARE GONNA END KATSEYE
i like commas
look at me
moreeee
I LOVE MY GIRLS
I think there's an actual mv cuz the teaser shows shots from a mv😔🤌
My girls ate!!!!!
Eso es todoooooo lo dieron todo mis reinas❤🎉
WHY SO SHORT JYPE!?????😢  I want moreeeeeeeeeee
Who ever did Savannah's hair should be in jail
Son muy buenas la verdad merecen algo mejor
OMGGGGG
Me encanta
😍😍😍😍😍😍
omg i love it 🙌🏻
This song is so good❤
A pre chorus - a bridge - a high note -a dance break all of that in little more than 2 min they’re mind blowing 🤯
What about give Lexi more lines ? I just hear the annoying Kendall pitch way too much
JYP is that real? Not official MV and a 2 min song? No mini album at least ? They deserve better.
Energy, style & killer moves 🔥💃 GIRLSET absolutely nailed this choreography version of Commas!
So short, whyyyy?
Love the song but why did JYP release a choreography ver. before an actual MV? 😭 We NEED an MV
Lexi❤Camila❤Savanna❤Kendall❤
The budget is definitely not giving commas
Tienen un flow a lo pussycat dolls ❤
I love iiitttt ❤
I got better than the vibe of the old vcha
Классная песня🎉❤
I was missing my Queen Camila
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL DAMNNNNN
Jyp is literary kidding with their idols
OH THIS ATE.
OH MY GOD
this is fire
What omg??
Bravo!!!!! Bellísimas!!!!
Every like i watch this clip again!
Love the song. Love the girls. JYP you're a greedy little b word for not giving them a proper MV and rollout.
Catchy!
Don't worry, we will not let GIRLSET down. We need all of us to support GIRLSET. Stay strong GIRLSET and Mus rau nws [화이팅 (hwaiting (fighting))] Lexus Vang (Hmong girl)!
Waitttttt they ateeeee
Kendall is the only hot one.
New girl group??
❤❤❤
Lets get it GIRLSET !
Recuerden que esto es una probadita de lo que se viene, así que apoyen a las chicas para que puedan tener una excelente promoción y todo.
Yo creí que sacarían un mv :c
Vocals ate❤
Im crying this is the song of the year ❤
Jyp didn’t do any promo
Let's go GIRLSET🖤♥️
이 그룹 구성도 좋고 매력도 있지만, 이 곡에 대한 광고는 이미 다 끝난 것 같아요. 정말 멋진 뮤직비디오를 기대했는데. 이 멤버들이 더 많은 관심과 투자를 받는다면 정말 빛날 수 있을 것 같아요.
Vamos chicas, esto es de ustedes
Is this a debut??
VOCALS OMG ATE❤❤
It was great, the truth is that I had faith in them, I hope they do very well, they really have my support, I wish them the best.
Esqueceram o MV no churrasco
Amei? amei, mas eles foram absurdamente sacanas de ter feito esse alarde todo por um choreography video. Uma ano no porão e a jyp não teve coragem de trazer o comeback/redebut com um MV de verdade.
JYP america sucks, where is the fucking budget The song is really nice, I love it. But the quality of the performance video is meh
Está bueno la rola
Definitely needs to be longer with a dance break yall killed it but the girl with the black hair it is for me don't know names yet but I'll get there this song is on my playlist now.
I’m so happy they’re back but I hope we get an actual MV! 😭
Bueno chicos!! de aca soy y aca me quedo, GO GIRLSET!!!
sounds like "girls don't like" and needs new lyricists.
I’m gonna stream anyways cuz I want my girls to get paid, but this is honestly disrespectful to fans. We’ve waited soooooo long , and we get a shitty choreo video with horrid camera work, only one set, only one hair/makeup/outfits. Don’t get me wrong, the song and video is not bad, but it’s not good enough. JYP is supposed to lead in entertainment, and they are constantly failing their own artists. Not to bring up another group, but GIRLSETS main comp is KATSEYE, which is very hard to beat. So , this low budget comeback is not doing any justice…. Please release better songs that are more listenable on a daily, songs that everyone would like, release actual expensive MUSIC VIDEOS. Promote these girls on all the radio shows etc etc. JYP, do better.
They look grown up and different even though they're still minors. The song is good but is it healthy for them and are they ok? 😭😑
Aguante katseye
Me gusta. Por fortuna JYP no abandonó el proyecto, sino más bien lo renovó y ahora con GIRLSET las chicas tienen una nueva oportunidad de brillar, les deseo mucho éxito✨
Nada que ver la cancion
Worst redebut ever, love the girls and music, but bro???? Wheres the mv? Promotion??? Budget?? JYP america sucks😢
don't get me wrong this was great but where's the actual music video? the girls deserve a full comeback
🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻
I dont like black girls in kpop.
I'm so glad they are back this is perfection
They put so much effort on VCHA and can’t even do the same for their rebranding? This needed more commitment and money as to redeem JYP and the girls image after what happened.  It’s short and we’re only getting the choreography video on the release date?  seriously what’s going on…
Woah I see JYPs direction here. Instead of VCHA focusing on their individual uniqueness, now they all have this cool sense of racial ambiguity while still having a diverse look. It just seems more seem less and smart for international AND domestic marketing especially in Asian counties
Welcome GirlSet Keep Slaying and plz be more Active in the Future. For sure You will go BIG!
I love this if this is their debut then imagine the other songs that are waiting for uss!!!
Cadê o MV HAAAAAA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is so good
Slay ate that DOWN❤
Tenía muchas ganas de escuchar está joyita por completo, es adictiva. 🥰🫶🏻 Ahora necesitamos el MV. 🥺
So is this an international group ? It’s giving jyp wants the same success as hype did with katseye 😭
Where's the mv. Jyp don't care about girlset. My opinion jyp don't care anymore after what vcha said they did. Jyp only made three post about girlset they're not promoting them at all. This video should have over three million or more views and over 100k likes
You couldn't even give them a music video?? Wtf
New group in town 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is like a black pink katseye
❤❤❤❤
They were still perfect but VCHA was different😔
i'm inlove please give us the mv we needdddddd
LOBAAAAS
Orgulho das minhas meninas nós não sabemos de metade do que elas passaram todo esse tempo mas vamos respeitar a decisão delas e apoiar elas agora
savanna looks like anitta sm in here

These girls are so talented
2 minutes is criminallll
OOOOO THIS IS GOOD
THEYRE BACKK

ATEE
DIVASSSS
1:47 That’s so ironic 😢
So this is essentially like a pre-debut release, right? I love the concept, looking forward to what is next!
Divas vão brilhar muito

I was hopping for a MV but THEY KILL IT!!! JYP put some money on our girlssss !!!
MV whennn
Quick, who's your bias?!?!?!?!
진짜 1년 넘게 기다림 이제 날아오르자❤❤❤
Happy redebut
The song is good, the quality is super super bad.... 💗 i love girlset
Love the song, although I think they meant "ellipses" ...  Commas is fine though, because the point comes across. 😄
I thought the same thing as many other people; They need to spend more money on this group. They don't seem like they're part of a big company. They need money and better art direction.
Girlset RISEEEE
YES CHOREOOOO
omg this is so itzy i loved it
Now this is GirlSet!!!  This is the vibe we should of gotten from the start!   So proud of them!
What happened to Vcha?
New debut
I think i found a girl group to stan
Enserió? JYP que decepción, estoy molesta donde esta el MV ????
1:07
This is criminal that the song is 2:00 long
Isso não é um MV jyp
what the fvck where's the MV????
やっとケンダル推せるの嬉しい
Well, it's not a bad start but something feels off about it. Good luck to them. They have real potential.
Vcha's better 😢
Keep streaming
oh yall ate
Day one being GIRLSET fan
I thought an MV would come out, are yalk fr 😭😭😭 NO MV, what type of debut has no actual MV
savanna t amo
QUE GUAPASSSS
Let's get 1.2-1.5M first day GLights
Lindas
500k soon!!! Let's make them viral
Estou feliz com a volta delas ❤❤❤❤
Kaylee and KG used to get attention, now only the blonde haired black and white dressed girl gets attention. Please don't misunderstand this comment.  I love youuuuu
四人とも素敵❤応援がんばる❤
GIRLSET really said "Spend some money on me, money on me" but JYPE said "Nope, just film in a low budget single set"
OKAY, BUT WHY DOES THE WHOLE SONG KINDA DOESN'T FIT THE CHORUS IDK.  ANYWAYS I LOVE THE NEW SONGGGG
Si quieren que ellas funcionen tan bien como katseye como grupo global, jyp debe priorizarlas al nivel de twice y sk, Eso es lo que hace hybe y por eso le está yendo tan bien a katseye, porque a pesar de ser un grupo extranjero se encargan de que tengan los mejores coreografos, las mejores canciones, los mejores remix y desde el primer momento las trataron como si fueran uno de sus mejores grupos coreanos. Ahi está la clave
❤❤❤❤❤
❤
0:27
They are rebranded and don’t even deserve an MV? For god’s sake
みんな見てない間に大人になってて泣ける😢これから私達と一緒に頑張ろう
ba't nakikita ko si Awra Briguela 😞
GUYS IS J.Y.P. BLACKPINK
Me encanta 😂❤valió la pena totalmente
IM SPEECHLESS, THIS IS WAY BETTER THAN WHAT I IMAGINED
THANK GOD they ditched the name VCHA. It always made me cringe.
Slayyy
ATEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
yassssss
Wtf JYP???? Que es esto
shit sucks
おかえりー♡♡みんなかわいいー🥰
Hi STAY here to support..... congratulations to girlset and there fans..... hope you all the best for the future....❤❤❤❤
absolutely  amazinf
Lexiiii !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
help me guys... I'm confused. Is GIRLSET a sub unit? And what about Vcha? Are they still continuing?
woow the brewing time did wonders to these girls!! savanna omg i'm speechless she's the main girl now!! kendall's presence is way better, lexi is sooooooo beautiful and camila is rocking as always!!!!!
A música tá mais curta que o cabelo da Lexi.😢
🧡
Slaygyy queens ❤❤❤
Congrats, Girlset!  You all sound amazing together while providing vocal variety!!! I was expecting the song to be longer.  We need MOOOOOORRRRREEE! You all look great...minus the outfits...too distracting and it takes away from your beautiful voices. I think the grunge look you all sported in the shorts makes you all relatable, and it's palatable for young audiences (e.g., Kendall's outfit and Savanna's pants on the livestream countdown were fire!) NO PRESSURE TO BE LIKE THE OVERSATURATED, PLASTIC, X-RATED, "LOOK AT ME , I GOT NO CLOTHES ON BARBIES IN THE INDUSTRY!!! This is a new era; we are craving realistic, authenticity, and longevity.
THEY DID SO WELL!!!!
the bratz in real life
Miss the girlsss
so bad...
JYP treat Girlset like Katseye pls, they need to be more famous
Ummm why it looks so cheap
Who's the black haired guuurrrlll? Ate the dance 👌🏻
kendall's improvement 🥺🤍
めちゃくちゃ最高！！待った甲斐あった！！大好き！！
Suena bien
They debuted again with another name????
Jyp q es esta calidad
Sin duda esto me recuerda mucho a las bratz y yo amo a las bratz, increíble ❤
I LOVE ITTT
Is the song audio like this? Even in the audio the chorus instrumental always sounds muffled? Is it just my phone or is it really how it sounds?
ngl, 100 thought Soda Pop was coming on bc of the muted drum instrumentals.
IT'S GIVING! ITS ON FIRE!
I love the vibe of the song ...
At least they left the disney musical era.
Oh wow
SPEND SOME MONEY ON ME LIKE COMMASSSSSS 🎉
better vibe than another group they keep getting compared to. solid voices and solid moves. all pretty, too. massive potential!
I loved the song, the voices and images of the members are crazy, but I would have liked the mv to have more sets, clothes, more budget...
QUE BONITAS SE VEN! Ya las extrañaba, Girlset llegó para quedarse 😍😇
arka dekorlar stardoll basıc magzası
N0m4m3s p1nch3 Re Debut Más Forzado
Their VOCALS are so great !
They look like Little Mixxx in a god way
I love this i keep watching it over and over again❤
WILL THERE BE AN MV?
JYPE don’t flop pls  Don’t waste their talent.
KENDALL VOICEEEEEE OMG CAMILAAAA UFFFFFFFF LEXUUUUUUSSSSS DIOSMIOOOO Y SAVANNAAAAA LO DIERON TODOOOOOOO ME ENCANTA
This is so gooddd
Começou bem novamente jyp (ironia) um grupo de 4 e só 3 tem linha. Incompetência da porra viu
The layered harmonies are SO GOOD!
Is that the mv?
CAMILAS BRIDGE OMG
Encantou
So sad for these girls to be in jype… they can’t even promote their korean idols
who are they? Where is Vсha?
11h ago
POR QUE DURA TAN POCO? 😭
Shuting up the haters that said theyre going to have Katseye sound
Prefiro o Katseye
okay queens hihi
Straight up fireeeee 🔥🔥🔥 girlies delivered 💅✨️
this ATE girlset
I miss Kaylee and KG 😢😢
I can't believe that a big company like Jyp doesn't has money to promote and makes a good MV. It's clear that Jyp ruins their potential
LEXI EATTT
I’ve waited for soooooo long from Japan. Love to see you 4 together
amaba mucho vcha pero esto es un poco triste, donde esta el mv? un solo escenario? tan corta la musica? las chicas son talentosas pero la empresa simplemente no promueve correctamente a sus artistas
Camila definitely the main vocal, Savannah givin support vocal role/dance. Lexi support vocal/ lead dance, Kendall lead vocal/support vocal/visual ❤
VCHAAAA
I love this song smmmm
This girls have so much potential. Unlike others were saying, all of them OWNED the concept!!
Why are they giving me Itzy vibes 🤨🤨🤨
💕💕
NOPUEDESER
❤vcha girlset so much vlights forever kg lexi camila kendall savanna kaylee❤u all so much❤
OMG I have no words this is incredible
Perfeitas 🫶🏽🇧🇷✨
choreo version first 💔
Kendall omg, her voice is so catchy and softtt, she such a divaaaa, sasss girl 💅🏻
I feel like KG lawsuit and Kaylee’s abuse is fake they were used for publicity stunt for this rebrand, jypE knew english version of twice isnt working so they need to change and kick out the minors and make them like the global girl group they are
oh..
The song is good and their vocals are amazing! The styling could be better, imo.
vcha 😶😶
we’re so back!!🔥🔥
Kendall ooh
gogo!girlset💕 I'm savanna's fan✨⭐️✨⭐️(from A2K)
U keep looking at me.
I love u.
❤
Slaaaaaay girls.
The camera work is so bad
GOOO GIRLSS !!!!🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥🤸💥
oh okay
Fireeeeeeee🥵❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
From me who didnt watch the show but knows about them: They all look good, the dance has a lot of energy and theres some nice vocal runs in there (i need to check out the live later). Im not in love with the chorus buts its catchy. The verses and bridge are really nice. Song definately feels too short and fast but it makes you want to replay it to hear it again so I guess it works 😂 This doesnt sound like a katseye song which is also a plus (i like katseye, no hate. They are competitors so its good to have different sounds) 8/10. Wish them best of luck, would love to hear more
Lexi killing it and me at the same time, all the time
Nossa mano aquela lá de cabelo vermelho ta a cara sa Anitta
Jyp still doesn't promote his songs! It's a shame
JYP do like thet say... spend some money on them, they deserve it!
eww
コンセプトも曲も皆に合っていて本当に素敵 一曲じゃ足りないよ GIRLSETのアルバムを購入できる日を楽しみにしています！
THEY ATE
Kendall kinda sound like Haewon
It’s probably shorter for more faster views, which means more money.
Kendall has such a sweet vocal tone
Que temon!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Ateeeeee
Hoping for the best for GIRLSET!
😍😍letss gooo
ME ENCANTAAA
It’s like a rebranded version of vcha just with darker colors but it’s still a bit like a Disney song
WE NEED THE ORIGINAL MV
I love!! Devoraron!! 👑👑💜💜😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
The only feedback I would give is to differentiate verse 1, verse 2 and the bridge more cuz they all sound the same. But overall great song (definitely too short!)
A genuine fan of them from A2K to VCHA and now, rebranding as GIRLSET! They BREATHLESSLY ATE anyway! Looking forward to these girls  <3
Baru sempet nonton, keren banget GIRLSET❤❤❤❤
We need an actual MV 😭🙏
WE NEED THE ORIGINAL MV 😢
These girls can DANCEEEE omgggg❤
Keep fighting
We honestly needed 30 more seconds atleast !  It’s a crime how short it is 🥲
Hermosasssssss
Jyp I'm going to report you if you mistreat them. 😊
I really liked the song !!!!
Where's the mv? Did they send the choreography version first?
この時をずっと待ってた😭🎉✨ 歌もダンスもずっと上手くなってて感動した🥺✨
Lexy, i miss you
Don't get me wrong I love the girls and want the best for them, that's why I urge jype to give them better song. What even is that, it's empty, really short, and the promotion was so bad that most of the fans were already pissed by the song day before release. If you want this group to work, you must try harder and actually give them what they deserve : good instrumental, better promotion and a long song including three choruses and bridge. I used to love VCHA and will support the girls cause they're talented and unique, but jype need to seriously wake tf up and give them songs that are actually catchy and have a mainstream potential for them to grow
Sorry but no... I don't hate it but i just don't like it sorry guys
Okay they ate this up
SO HAPPY TO SEE MY GIRLS SHINING !!!!!
THEY ATEEEEEEEEEEEEE
😍
カミラはやっぱりカミラ🥰❤️ これからも楽しみ💕💕
OMG VOCALSSsSs..!!
Gonna crash tf out if this doesn’t get a million views by the end of the day
カッコいいし、元気もらえる！
This is absolute garbage
La canción no es tanto de mi agrado, pero los vocales que se cargan Dios mío, sin duda el concepto les queda bien, pero siento que algo falta, también es demasiado corto la canción😢
AYEYEEEEE
tuff.
Demoraram tanto e vocês vem com esse comeback fraco ? Tanto talento pra 2 min? Meu deus
MOTHER KENDALL
🎉Come on my girls!!!🎉
Girls are great, but JYP you better invest in them more.. this was low production quality. Im expecting the official video to be on much higher level. But girls are lit and song is amazing!
Las amare por siempre ❤, pero en otro universo todo estuvo bien y siguen siendo 6❤
May this be a begining  Always support you all luv u!!! <3
HELLO KENDALL?? I REALLY LOVE HOW HER VOCALS SOUND IN THIS SONG
JYP PROMOTE THEM PROPERLY!!
The song is soo gooddd
Jyp QUIERO MV, PERO QUITANDO ESO OMG LAS CHICAS SON GENIALES❤❤❤
os vocais meus amigos😲
Their vocals 😍 they’ve gotten so good
mis muchachas
I've never seen such a short music video.
Umm, when will the music video be released? I've been waiting for it for ages lol
Nunca había visto un vídeo tan corto
love itt
This feel so pre-released. I feel like they might drop something   more?
Now I understand why the teaser was too short…. The song it is too 😢
No le tenia fe, pero lograron sorprenderme la canción esta muy buena
VCHA SUB???
QUE VIVAN MIS NENAAAAAAS!!!! 😍😍😍
OOOOOOMG THIS CRAZY, I LOVEEEEE UU😭😭😭
Why isn’t there like an mv
lexi barely has parts
I love it every minute, every second and every moment about the girls 💖💖💖💖
sucks that they have amazing vocals but feel like they need to shake their chests for 50% of the choreo.
The vocals omd they ATEE❤
Este era el concepto que desde un inicio necesitaban
Support the girls
This is on fire
This is a very disappointing production for such an important and long-anticipated rebranding. These girls better leave JYPE as soon as possible, for their own good
The choreo was great, but not a huge fan of the song. It's kind of all over the place. Just my opinion.
Rebrand but not the MV what is this treatment!? This is already like low budget lol feel bad for the girls but love the song
where's the actual music video?
Its real bad….
Tudo perfeitooo preciso de mais
welcome back little mix
Jyp needs to work harder with the girls, the song is really good. I'm happy for the girls' return, but I thought they deserved an MV and not just a choreography video. I'm a little upset with JYP but I'll be with the girls!! Let's give COMMAS and the girls lots of love!❤❤
Why not MV !?
YESSS
Excellent, we wish you success.
The bridge had me shocked loving Commas already
Oh!! Slay girls!! The vibe is giving!!!
Weren't they 6 and his name is vicha?
Kinda interesting they’re talking about spending money when the video doesn’t give big budget
it’s giving ✨mature and woman✨ absolutely loving this rebrand
When so when is the me Gina get released or is it just the cheeography
I could watch this on repeat all day
Súper impressed will be keeping an eye on them
Gente, a música lutando pra ter 2min 😅. Acho que poderiam ter investido mais no clipe e no tempo da música. É a música de lançamento do grupo então deveria ser Ô VÍDEO POW 😢
걸셋이 슈스 되기를 기원합니다. 존버 2일차❤
Queenssss🤍✨
4人の雰囲気好きだなぁー♡ 日本から応援してます！
When does the merch come out? They are so beautiful
Wait where is the MV?
Omg, these girls got no vocal
VAMLS DAR STREAM, NO SPOTIFY, EM TODAS AS PLATAFORMAS DIGITAIS
뭐임? 정식 뮤비도 없는거임??
Is jyp broke or something why didn't they get a music video for their first rebrand song???????????
KENDALL LINDONAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SAVANNA ESTÁ MUITO ICONICA
Vem aí?
LEXI ESTÁ TAO LINDAAAA
OS VOCAIS DE CAMILA ESTÃO SURREAIS
GIRLSET eat, but i think our girls deserved more then just one set and 2 min song
Que loira linda
Okay.. that’s ACTUALLY SO GOOD
OMG LOVE IT !!!
Bro what was GIRLSET budget for their debut ??? A gum and 5 cents??? JYP raise the budget.
God I love this song. I usually hate the trend of short pop songs, but this song hits every beat it needs to in its length, like a punk song would.
I MISSED U GIRLS I LOVE THE SONG
Idk, I thought it would be different, it's the same song they could come up with as Vcha 😂 the only thing that changed is their outfit and makeup style
I love the high notes of this song
Sending love To the girls❤❤❤❤
成功の道しかありません❤
Feo todo
lexi eating this shit upppp
이번에 노래 진짜 좋아...
We’ve been waiting for over a year for something new from these girls and they don’t even get an MV debut? They have potential, but JYP keeps giving them nothing
BASTA LA CANCIÓN ES ADICTIVAAAA
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
But I miss KG and Kaylee,I miss VCHA
why this first before the MV?
вау,это потрясающие и талантливые девушки😮
Esto es como escuchar a Itzy 😭 esperaba más.
Mükemmelsiniz
This vdo looks cheap
ATEEEEEEE
MIS CHICASSS🔥❤️
頑張ってー！応援してるよ！
待ってました！ みんな大人っぽくなってカッコいいです❤ 応援してます！🎉
なんか売れそう
They're finally back 🤭🤭
My girls they did so good🎉❤❤❤❤
So... where exactly were the commas when discussing the lack of budget put into this choreography video? It's not even an MV for crying out loud. JYP is doing Girlset so dirty rn.
OMG IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE SONG IS SHORT BUT CHICASSS THE VOCALS THE CLOTHES THE STAGE THE CHOREOGRAPHY THE OMGGGG CONCEPT, IT'S SO WOW
JYP I can sell you some songs for your kpopbands please reach me out if you are interested.
No entiendo que dicen, la canción está increíble!!!
노래 좋아요 ❤
Me encantaaaa! Es tan buena la canción! No puedo dejar de escucharla Help 😭✨
I love them so much ❤
Love the song, love the performance, love y’all girls! ❤
I want to like it. But why not put out an official video instead of a choreography video? This video feels rushed and low-budget.
So happy they got rid of that stupid kid concept
this is a very expensive redebut but please give savannah some bangs it would REALLY suit her
SPEND SOME MONEY ON THESE DAMN GIRLS JYP!!!!!!! budget isn’t budgeting with this one :((
They deserved the debut after all the trouble i love themm ❤❤
why does this sound familiar
Let’s get this dance choreography version of the music video to 700,000 views we are sitting at 439,103 views so far and the video has only been out for 10 hours so far. Hopefully if JYPE see how high the views are they will finally release the actual Music Video.
대박 멋지게 컴백~~!! 에너지 넘친다!!!
Aaaa I don't know if I'm the only one but I can't stop listening to the song!!! One more vice I love the song
You killed it girls!!! 🤘🔥
came back and served
Once here to support sister group!! Girlset here to rock !!!
El primer verso de kendall es tan adictivo
Os vocais delas melhoraram MUITO parebens a msc ta incrivel
❤❤❤
Commas
i ddnt know jyp has a new gg
wow
Omg, This is so really good ❤
Omg they slayed so hard🔥🔥🔥
Mil veces mejor que las gatasojas
Welcome back girls!!! Slayeddd
love thissssss 😍😍
What is the name of the one with short hair?
This performance deserves to be on Studio Choom 😊
So they went from cute and cuddly to borderline sexualized. Okay I’ll take a bite.
Before the MV everything out?
I hope they get the fame they deserve
this is what they should have been doing from the beginning
렉시 사랑해. 화이팅해
Well, im surprised it's better than i expected, like sooo much better
MV?
Es todo lo que esperaba y mucho más 💗🥰
Finally, my incomprehensible pockets are now more suitable for them. It is true that I miss O2 but I am wearing a 4. I love you from Saudi Arabia. + My pockets: Can you do collaborations with K-pop groups, for example, Stray Kids, ITZY, Kickflip, NeXY, NMX, Twice, Enbin, Tmuru, and Time, Empress and One? This way, they will get a large audience. Please, I do not want a week and for them to be forgotten. K-pop stans. I have been a fan of theirs since their first debut when they were 6. Now, please raise my comment so that I can see my pockets or the members. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Jyppp please some auditions In Germany!! G2K!!
Luv Girlset sooo much!!!❤❤❤...im soooo proud of yall !!!! This song is awesome!!👍🏽👍🏽
Twice and Itzys baby fr!!! so glad to see the girls again, I hope theyre all doing well!
Wow, they might be super introverted during interviews but their charisma and energy while performing is insane! I remember JYP saying that Kendall had star quality and that she only needed to work on that and he was right! She looks incredible now!
Sorry it's too short🥹😔2:03
It’s good , reminds me of Kickflip pre release umm great which only had a white background lol and mama said had the more extravagant sets for their official debut . So I’m going to wait for the dance practice . Congrats girls on your debut ❤
Slay kweens
Sex sells, I guess
Está increíble, yay! 🤩🤩
この質感めっちゃ4人に合っていていいと思う！これからがんばれ！！
I love it very much
So they switch from cute disney vibes to descendants disney vibes, same cringe.
I am so disappointed in jype bc why is this song 2:02 ???? Like I expect this song to be longer, but the music video seems so cheap like I expected them to like do more for the girls like I’m so disappointed in jype, but I love this song. I just wish that jype didn’t go cheap on them like this whole set looks so cheap. I just wish they just went out for the girls, but not fully out that they go bankrupt, but just out where it’s not so cheap, very disappointed in jype.
this will be on repeat best believe
spend your own money on you
❤support for these girls!!
vocals are A1
ATE
I love itt🫦🥹
It's obvious they'll be BIG, pls promote them very well. Love Girlset!!
So good ! GO GIRLSET☆☆☆☆
esperava um MV ou algo mais elaborado,jyp deveria dar mais investimento para o grupo se ele quer que ele cresça,n so nos grupos grandes
Wow! Muy buena canción!!! Felicitaciones Girlset 👍👍👏👏👏👏👏❤️
I see the growth. Now, they look really on point in dance,  in singing and in confidence. It's on point. I don't like some of their outfit though.
I'm so surprised by savanna's vocal, she improved a lot in these years like she has developed such strong vocal that's making me repeat the MV over and over and also Camila's high note, Lexi's dance also Kendal she improved a lot too I'm really happy for them. Keep going guys we're here to support you❤💖 Also 1:44 to end was superb
i hope this is just the beginning 'cause honestly a 2 minutes song is too little for them
Their vocals are getting better and better!! Really amazing!!! girlset fighting!!!!
will there be an official MV? i was expecting an official MV... not a choreo version. 😳
THAT'S GIRLSET 🔥
❤❤
Congratulations this song is so good! They voices complimented to the concept. The dance? Wow
Will there be a full music video?
Mi bias is the black hair short❤
❤
Let's keep stream it guys let's support this new era of girlset ❤🎉🎉🎉
우리 걸셋이 슈퍼스타가 되는 그날까지 존버한다!!!
the song sounds a bit empty, its short, a choreography video was released before an actual M/V, and it was teased for so long that the song got boring for some. the girls are super talented, JYP needs to do better.
my girls
High notes>>>>>>
so good
we were robbed of having an mv
MORE SLVT$ TR@SH.😒🙄
WOOOOAH, I DID NOT EXPECT THAT. It's giving Itzy. All of them are powerhouse vocalists.
LOVED IT❤❤❤❤
Jyps response to Katseye, I’m not mad at it
I miss Vcha. This type of group singing about being selfish and entitled and dressed like garden tools is a dime a dozen. Unfortunate.
8
Let's gooo!
jyp는 이제 mv를 올려라!! 곧 한국시간으로 자정이다. 이 퍼포먼스 비디오도 좋지만 다른 것도 더 있겠지?
وااو حلوين والاصوات تجنن🩷🩷🩷🩷
B!C#€$ SLVT$ ??? BORING....
This song is too good but you can't really enjoy it cause it's already ended. Cmon JYP do at least 30-40 secs more. Girls you slayed❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Fighting Girlset!
Onlyfans????🙄
Why is the song such bad quality and the video so poorly made? Everything seems low budget
so exciteeeed

Camila betta hit that high note yass!
Savanna looks like the diva Anitta 😮❤
Yes!! Beautiful!
Yyaaaasssss finally!!
Sigo a TWICE, pero me gustó
멜로디 중독적이야.
JYP. You are literally home of TWICE, you guys can promote these girls SO MUCH BETTER. LOVE YOU GIRLSET! 💖
where is mv this is only choreography video vote for mv
Well they on some other level now 🗨🎯🥊
I can see that Lexi was doing ballet
The song sucks.
Esos vocales!! Tremendos!!
YESS GIRLS, KEEP GOING😩
There is a problem with their height. The blonde tall girl does not fit the others.
YESSS SHOW THEM WHO THE OG AND BEST GLOBAL GG ISSSSSS
AMOOOOOO!! LAS CHICAS TIENEN MUCHO TALENTO
They're not gonna go far even with the rebrand after the kg thing and if they were her friends after seeing what happened to her why would u still go with a company that did horrible things to someone
歌声がめちゃいい！
歌声がめちゃいい！
❤
this eatsssss, good job ladies ❤❤
누구냐
Radio ready. Great debut girls!
What a terrible video. They deserve better
In recent years, JYPE's compositional abilities have made me question my ears, in a very bad way, Currently, their songwriting skills are worse than those of small and medium-sized agencies, group chanting or rapping, weak beats, and very weak bass. For all the reasons, the song feels very flat without any impact
wtf jyp, more time for the next song please
jyp는 좀 파워풀한 쪽이 더 잘 만드는것 같아
No puedo parar de escuchar la canción me encanta mi nueva canción favorita y el vocal de camila mi bias desde A2K la rompío
ES BUENÍSIMAAA
Cada vez que curtirem meu comentário, eu assisto essa obra prima
Why so low budgeted?
사바나 여왕으로 등극.
yeah,katseye is way better then this cheap global sounds like kpop
❤❤❤❤❤
global? more like cheap kpop 😂
100 PERCENT SATISFIED. I MISSED YOU GIRLS SMMMM
flop and bad
Temon la rompieros chicas
IM SOOOOO PROUD OF
Is this a kpop group?...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Okay their sharp moves and that choreography hits hard 😭🫶🏻
gente isso é o céu
This direction is more interesting and fun compared to what VCHA was aiming for
MARAVILHOSAS
welcome back Girls.
FLOP QUEENS
😐
I've been waiting desperately for this ever since their debut
I think I'll need another song for judgement. Cuz so far "Girl of the Year" has a bigger hold on me lol
VCHA의 팬입니다. 팀원조정된 GIRLSET응원합니다. 곡도 흥있어 너무좋다.
めっちゃいい！！最高です！！！ これからも応援してます
This song was very catchy, and their pop vocals were great too. I hope they'll release more singles.
So short
I LOVE IT
이거지. 파워 넘쳐. 걸그룹은 기세지
Reinas
Ameee
สักที!!!!
사바나 반했어
Queens ❤
오우 엣지 터진다. 환상적이야
my girls are BACK !!
THE VOCALS⁉️⁉️THE RAP⁉️⁉️ THE BRIDGE⁉️⁉️ LIKE,HELLO⁉️⁉️😨
Super Low cost
I love the vocals and the vocal runs. Adlib .
Why they release the performance video instead the mv??? hello????? we want the mv, these girls deserve more than thisssss!! (i love the song and everything but i thought they would give us at least an mv...)
Excelente canción ❤️ pero me blanquearon mucho a savanna 😭
네 멤버 모두 목소리가 천상계다 이 언니가 응원한다 걸셋❤
El nuevo inicio de Girlset merecía un MV?
GIRLSET blessed us with an amazing song and a great choreography!! the bridge is everything <3 I just wish the song was a bit longer.
WOW IT’S LIKE ITZY CONCEPT WHEN THEY PRIME!❤
EVERYTHING IS JUST PERFECT🙌🙌
Hybe new gg have 4 members also
Wow! They killin it . Omg . I forgot no need subtitle😂
0:12 Savanna took to heaven🙏🙏
올해 들은 노래 중에 TOP!
Omg but lookin at me bruhhh❤❤
It's sad that some have LEFT💔🥀😭because of the problems on VCHA But what a comeback! Their new single "Commas" is finally here this music is incredible this single is really great too bad the song is so short on this we love you kisses❤❤❤
Me encanto la música seguiré apoyando las
Is this the official mv?
The song  is good
las amoooo 😭😭
It's great to see some of the girls back!! 😍  I have to say that the set is giving heavy Target dressing room vibes to me 🤣🤣🤣  Looking forward to the official MV! 🥰
i can smell success 💋👠♥️
THIS IS SOOO GOOD OML!!! Definitely a little bit too short because it’s so good but I will be listening again 🥹❤️‍🩹
CAMILAS HIGH NOTE????!!!!
its a shame its so short but OMG THEY ATE SO HARD AND THEY SOUND SO GOOD
THIS IS SO GOOD😭
みんなおかえり💖大人な感じで今までのコンセプトと違って新鮮✨ もっともっと世界へ羽ばたけますように！日本で待ってます🇯🇵💖  Congrats comeback!!!!ILOVEYOU from japan👼🏻🤍
The only thing that could have made this better imo was a more climatic buildup into the chorus and a longer dance break at the end. Other than that, I’m well satisfied! Good job girls
YESS GIRLL 🔥🔥
0:40 lexi’s short hair eraaa Edit:Not trynna be that person but..Mom im famous🎉🎉🎉
choreography before the mv? seriously?
omg!!!!!!!
Slay girls .
The vocal, the visual OMGG 💞
Same 🥲 گۆرانیەکە زۆر تایبەت نەبوو
official video is just one place? to dance and sing?? 😑😑😑
Yesssssss this BANGER!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YOU WILL NEVER BE KATSEYE
son talentosas, que bueno que sigan su sueño, sin embargo en um primer momento no las reconoci, ha sido un cambio de imagen  muy fuerte, incluso parecen katsaye, creo que ustedes son mas feescas, es la empresa que comete desatinos, quienes manejan a las chicas estan viejos o desfasados.
They ate DOWN
i really like it
ところで…この子たちは何歳ですか？振り付けや衣装は、確かに慣れるまでは楽しめない味ですね。
im trying so hard to like it😅 im sorryyy
The beginning sound like itzy’s dalla dalla
WAIT WHAT IS THAT THE VCHA GIRLS
OMG THIS IS ART ❤
There isn't MV?
すごくいい！！
Que bueno teneros de vuelta ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is this song so short-
We cannot let this flop! They worked too hard to get here ❤
I actually really like this song, but why is it so short and why does the music video look cheap.  All this time for a comeback and JPY gave them this??
Lexi looks amazing with short hair!
Savannah is SERVING LOOKS
THIS IS SOOO GOOD
Where is other members.?
Nombreeee mejor nadotaaaaa😔☝🏻 ta bien chida la canción pero bien corta
vcha...
Hermosassssssssss
Wooow el cambio es muy bueno
応援してるよ！！！がんばれ！！
Im sorry but it sounds a MESS
本当に全員タイプの違う美人でめっちゃ良い！！特にカミラかっこよすぎる！オーラがすごい　みんなすごいけど
THIS IS WHAT TALENT AND BEAUTY LOOKS LIKE
The song is so so good, thank you girls ❤ I wish the best for you all so your story can only carry on in commas!!
2 minutes is crazy
The irony of the song being about being able to afford all these things when JYPE hasn’t paid them yet 💀
Ameeeeeeeeee ❤❤❤❤
thank you sm jyp and staff oooh finallyyy 😅cant wait for the music videoooo
SLAYYYY
Jyp what is this? I was sooo excited for the girls and then we got this. I agree with those who sais the ent needs to spend more money on them and also I also agree with the "it feels a cheap reused song" it's like the song and the refrain is 2 different thing.  The room feels a bit off. Like they don't have enough space to dance. The camerawork is weird to me. Furthermore the live performance sounded totally different. Almost like the ent forgot to train the girls properly in the last 1-2 years. BUT THEY HAVE SO MUCH POTENCIAL. However this just feels like a visually well represented fan cover group. JYP YOU CAN DO BETTER. GIVE THE GIRLS WHAT THEY DESERVE. Dont't let them down like itzy. They didn't even started...
Someone actually approved this song and heard a hit? Good luck to them.
this is the problem with jyp, yall post so much content hyping up girlset and their rebrand when there isn’t even any mv??? the song is literally 2 minutes. its just setting them up against the odds, do better and stop being lazy jyp
vocals ateeee
Not an MV!? 2 minutes!?
Wala ba tong MV?
OMG this song😍☝
THE BREAK DANCE!!😮😮😮😮
Omg amo esta canción!! 😳❤me encantó
ITZY
New name. Same crappy VCHA songwriters
❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
ME ENCANTOOOOO 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Theirrr vocallllssss SAVANNAAAHHHH- 😭😭❤❤❤
My girls are back 🥹❤️‍🩹
OKAY BUT THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE THIS SHORT?!? JYPE please, we're begging at this point 😭❤️ this girls are worth every penny you can invest
Omg, not even a Music Video? 😅
las amoooo 🩷 queens
Truly Camila's era... Girl you over ate!!!! Leaving us hungry for your next releases and fancams
i love This song
I didn't follow Vcha before, but this has poked my interest.  I hope this plays out well for them.
SUNTILI LASSO
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where's is the leak bridge?
The vocals are damn good but what is that song 😭 jyp youre gonna gonna loose your top 3 companies tittle atp
Lexi, thank you for that giving up! You're making us Hmong proud! You're forever our megastar! 🌟💖   LET'S FREAKIN' GO, GIRLSET! SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU!!!
I love thier rebranding, but i think this looks more like a performance video than mv
もっと金かけてあげてよ！！！！応援するから！！！！
Why can't JYP give songs like this to ITZY omg
me encanta!!
The perfect (re)debut🥹
THIS IS FOR JYPE AMERICA FORMER MANAGEMENT 🖕🖕🖕
Kendalllll
Okay. Entiendo que no hayan sacado un MV primero pero, no les pudieron cambiar el escenario en el break dance?! 😮‍💨... Igual las amamos GirlSet! ❤
ahhhh🔥🔥
Love this. Proud of them. Congrats on the redebut.
SOTY EVERYONE‼️‼️‼️
Hopefully they realise a music video
Omg las amoo cuando tiempo espere para verlas nuevo
I’m so excited for this new era!!!! ❤❤❤ they look amazing!!!
OMG my girlsss🥹❤️‍🔥✨.. cant wait for the Music video 🫶🏻
Love it!! ❤
missed yall
ATE
Am confused what was ur budget to film this
Go girl‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Why does JYP struggle making songs that aren’t corny as hell
After the youngest (KG and Kaylee) left the group, JYP decided to switch to completely different concept.
This song is so addictive lol🔥
I'm sad that JYP probably only released the song because of contracts, I hope it hits on TikTok to give the girls good visibility.
TWO MINUTES OF QUALITY
Kendal looks not recognisable
is this Little Mix ??
I miss the so much 😢
200% vocals 100% dance 100% i support that they still want to follow their dreams, i just hope jyp treats them better this time   but what's with the overly zoomed in camera on those moves, i know they are all adults now and they have rebranded, but this is a bit disturbing
So short and no mv? 😢😢
노래 너무 좋고 퍼포먼스 멋져요
It is good that these girls placed the blame solely on the abusive employees instead of on JYP and JYPE like the mature adults they are. Kaylee leaving was sad but understandable as she took the most damage from the abuse. I personally believe that KG should have sued the abusive employees and the incompetent supervisors only with help from JYP's legal team instead of the whole company. She would have JYP's legal team supporting her instead of fighting against her and a better chance of winning..
Been waiting for this yes! Locked in for more!
ohh the short hair girl ate this one up
The best song ❤😊
okay boleh la. acceptable!!! sukaaa
who misses kg and Kaylee
Luhh Ang ganda👏✨👏👏
fire!! Go girlset!!!!!!!! Loved it! The girls are amazing!!
Let's goo!!!!!!!!!
We should be honest with this but, it's not giving at all. JYP did them dirty again 😶. I expected a MV for their song.
Will we see them go live on a kpop music show?
this song is good ❤
TROP CONTENTE
Muy buena canción, pero y el vídeo oficial ???
They sound good! Better in fact. But given the lenght of the song it seems they are testing the waters. Go Girlset
не интересно
1M in 24 hours let's go
😂 2 min song? The dead of bridges.
Vamossss!!! We love Girlset, sigamos apoyando. ❤
OMG Girls, this is so great... I'm so proud of you, keep it up, I love you all
Me encantó
This song is VERY good
So~~~~ GOOD !!!!
Ame esta canción, pero es muy corta
STOP MAKING SHORT SONGS
Danggggggg this is so addicting..love ittttttttt
A savana tá parecendo alguma das caras da anitta, essa música é original delas? Ela soa mt parecido com outra música, e parte do instrumental lembra daladala do itzy me bugo vendo, elas mudaram radicalmente mds.  Estão lindas e espero que tenham apoio do público, eu gostei.
YES!
wait this sounds so good
Flop
Where's the MV? 😢
2:02 for a whole song is wild. There are intros that are longer
Camilaaaa
ELAS VOLTARAM 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
i lvoe ths
JYP needs to give these girls some commas
I love this song
Lexi I love youuuuu
Love you Girlset
These girls are soo good, I really wish they were managed properly, they could be so successful.
yuhh
I don't like it.... just a cheap copy of Katsye
wait this is TEA
Hello this is so good? I’m a Midzy that’s been here since A2K and so proud of these girls. Just wish it was longer 😫
I LOVE THIS AHH
Wow love it ❤
Y esas preciosas
The lip-syncing is bad in this. Their lips don't match up.
Yassssss they slayed❤💅🔥
이거다 드디어 제 심장이 뛰기 시작햇어요,, 좋은 노래로 활발한 활동 기대합니다
Camila slay her vocal like everytime👑👑❤❤ Kendall expressions are everything✨✨✨✨ Lexi and Savanah vocal improve a lot💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽

This song is very good!
Wishing big success for Girlset!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn’t expect this like choreography of this song is soo catchy i love it❤
Lexus is our Hmong k pop princess
The performance and style is AMAZING, they are super cool!!! I do kinda wish to hear more in the background beat tho cuz these queens so talented
the music is a bop but the lyrics are vapid AF
OMG
Iiii
Wait somethings missing.
コンサートが楽しみです。🤭🇯🇵
Me chamem de louca, mas a Savannah tá parecendo a Anitta com o cabelo liso assim
Siento que no fue suficiente sólo un mv asi tan simple
So now yall forgot what happend to these girls? And these 2 who left
Kendall mejoro su voz
This song is such a vibe!!!!😍
I LOVE THIS!❤
My girls are back i was so worried that all of you would quit even tho yall aren’t ot6 anymore u guys still slay like b4❤
Que talentosas
🎉🎉
Arrasaram demais 😳😳😳❤
おかえり！待ってたーーー！ みんな可愛く、綺麗になって素敵です！！
I truly enjoyed how each section each member was singing. They exaggerated different vocals that you can clearly hear their texture in their voice. but Jyp needs to start spending some money on Girlset.
It’s so good!!! They are all such good dancers!! ❤️❤️can’t wait for Whats next
400K NEXT GOAL ❤❤❤❤
Okay forehead ... period 🎉
I love it! Beautiful!   I wish it was longer but otherwise perfect!
I love grilset
This soooo Fireeee
This kinda eats
Yas love it slay girl set
BROOOO THIS IS FIREEEEEE
Excuse me?? Savanna's vocals??? They're amazing. Camila is incredible, she's a majestic all rounder.
Excellent.
HERE TO SUPPORT ❤❤
NICEEE
Me encantan las notas altas joder
1:28
I think I'm not a fan of a drastic concept change like that... I mean maybe it'll grow on me, but for now I still remember them very bubbly and in my head they're still younger, like time got stopped in my head. I have mixed feelings, but I hope JYP will take good care of what's left in this group
Verse 1  Said you want a one-way ticket to my heart (Yeah) Took that slow way down, I'll catch the way you flirt  You've been waiting patiently for me to run into your arms But I need more, more  Pre Chorus  I don't need your permission, you get it?

WHERE'S THE ACTUAL MV JYPE!
ateeee😮💋
Kendall look fabulous
Short but enjoy it all..!💫👀 btw their dance moves...! Fantastic
Can't wait for 1st mini album
This is honestly how they should have started. It’s so good
I’m in shock honestly I’ve been listening to K-pop since 2019 and the amount of mistakes JP‘s making like at this point I genuinely think he’s doing this on purpose because there’s no way he rebranded a whole group and released basically half of the song before actually releasing the real song That’s one and two like just the fact that he released the choreography version and when you have a rebrand of an already failed group. A two minute song is literally not enough. I could go on for hours about this, but this is just crazy like I genuinely think he’s doing this on purpose just to keep them in the ditch.
Gooooo girlssss❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Es increible que después de todo lo que pasaron Jyp solo les da un mísero MV versión coreo, la canción es genial pero JYP es tremendo tacaño
Being honest I did not have much expectations! But this song is so good!!  I know it is short  But we got everything
Tremenda mierda
GOD DAMN, THEY SURE SNAPPED! ❤❤❤❤❤
So vibeeee
THIS IS SONG OF THE YEAR OMG😭Amazing vocals,cool choreo and fun song 10/10🙏Good job girls
Who are they and why do they sound so bad?
Lexi visual is insane ! Love all the gurl !!!
U KEEP LOOKING @ ME LIKE U WANA..
But they dance just😢😢
YESSS THIS IS SO BADDIE CODED❤❤❤
The song is good the camera is so ahh
Wao i like it
The camerawork is horrible! Why tf do  you never see the coreo!!??
Que MV ruim! Tadinha das meninas, deveriam ter saído da JYP também.
こういう路線で行く訳だな。 なら尚更、ジーナとクリスティーナが必要だったと思うが。。。
The amount of money they invested is so evident…
I liked the vibe of the strong woman and the coordination of the dance, but I think that the group needs to show more vocal power and rap sections with strong bars to enter the international classification, but as a first song, I liked “Good luck.”
I didn’t watch a2k or listen to VCHA, I’m just a Skz fan passing through; but Lexi has just has that star quality to her. Couldn’t take my eyes off of her!!
I've heard this song somewhere before🤔
They’re backkkkkkk
A little bit like gnarly but awesome
Love the song , the girls did great , wonderful vocals, impressive presence, we hope we will get longer songs and MVS in the future. Bravo girls .
No music video? Or am i missing something?
2 min song is crazy
me encanto es como una combinación de Itzy con Twice
YESSS THEY ATEEE
Jyp couldn't spend the commas on an actual music video?
Camila is a star omg
There vocals improved so muchhh ong😭😭😭
Hope they for real spend some money on them though 🙏🥀
Wow It is so different vibes to VCHA   i didn't recognize it was VCHA ， i through it was a new group 😂
컨셉이 훨씬 잘어울리네....
Vcha❤
DIVASSSS
MARAVILHOSASS
DIVASSS
QUEENSSS
Wait, are they releasing a choreo ver before the actual music video? Never seen it done that way before. Or are they just not getting a music video? Also, jesus christ, barely 2 minutes is ridiculous, I've heard longer album interludes. Pretty good though, short or not.
I think their voices sound louder than the melody. 😢
Why is song short 😢😢😢
Muito boaaaaaaaa
I really hope you all support girlset now like you supported vcha because they are still the same girls you loved if not stronger. They went through a lot behind the scenes to stay together and get to this song so give them some love 💘
Y'all slay so hard
Is this the M/V😐🫥
these girls deserve better!! this all seems to be such a low budget, shouldn't they at least get a mv?
Girlset forever ❤

Omg this song was better than I expected
Girl why is this song SO SHORT and why do these girls have zero budget 😭😩  I love the members fr tho 💖💖💖
The end is such a good idea
Savanna 진짜 놀러울만큼 실력 많이 늘었다
SO HAPPY THEY BROUGHT THEM BACKK!!
Girlset best group ever ❤
JYPE PLEASE KEEP POSTING ABOUT GIRLSET WHEN YOU CAN ❤❤
Savanna ate this tume ❤
Still hoping that they Will upload the mv ver on midnight kst time
ようやく歌声聴けて嬉しい！😭しかもみんなビジュもボーカルもダンスもレベルアップしてる！✨✨
This song deserves a proper prechorus
They killed this, this is amazing, the things they went trough to come back with such a BOP!? im proud of you girls ❤
No sé porque siento q esta vez no me gustó ( con todo respeto). Mentira las amoooo❤❤❤
omggg lexi dancing skills 🔥🔥
To those who keep commenting to invest more on this group... in reality Idk if JYP would spend money on this group. 340k views after 8 hours since posted... investment happens to the one's that are worth.
This new concept is really good but I see I like their old teen fresh concept more
JYP. Girlset MV 제작에 돈 좀 써라
Muy aperoooo
La canción con es muy buena hubiese soportado un segundo verso con rap pero supongo que esta bien para ser una introducción. Esperemos que pronto puedan traer nueva musica  mas larga
ATE DOWNNN
Мне нравится! Очень интересно-что будет дальше!
MY WOMEN
0:31 hot mama❤
Loving this new side❤
8 hours ganggggggggg❤❤😊❤❤😊😊❤😊❤😊❤❤

JYP's incompetence knows NO BOUNDS. Who releases a choreo version of a title track BEFORE the video drops? NOBODY, becauses it's idiotic. 🤦‍♂
Me encantaaaaa
They released the song on my birthday ❤
OMMMGGG
AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!
Camila looks legit gorgeous and killing
New blackpink?Or new aespa?No...this is new generation of kpop-I LOVE IT
everyone on tiktok joked that this would only be two minutes long because of how long theyve been teasing one section…..  now its quite literally two minutes long
サバンナちゃんが歌が上手くなっててびっくりした❣️🎉🎉
헬스클럽 피트에서 운동할때 듣기 딱 좋은 음악...Double Thumbs Up
Let's support girlset  we can see your efforts ....Lexus , Kamila , Savana , Kendall ... FIGHTING 🤩🥰💗
What a incredible improvement Savanna' s vocal showed here.. No body can believe this is the same Savanna of the A2K
Anitta???
they're not even getting a mv? 💀
短いとこがちょい悲しいけど、再デビューおめでとう😭待ってたよ！！
(Pre chorus) 0:26 Look my and Mony a my  (Pre chorus) 1:06 Look my and Mony a my  (Bridge)  Up girls!, They are in line   (3-Verse-Chorus)  I will keep my heart, I will not give it to just any Cockroach  Naneun A boy dong-nip-jeogin, That namjaga piryo eopseoyo
SLAYEDYDYDYEHWHDHF
nossa a menina de cabelo ruivo parece anita 😯
Espero que esto sea un prerelease 🤨🤨🤨🙄🙄🙄🙄
rezalet saygısızca ve eski ünlerini kazanmak için tworke başvurmuşlar  inşallah gelcekleri olmaz ve kge ve keyleeye yaptıklarının aynısını yaşarlar
The vocals are so good!! I do think Savanna should have MORE lines though! 😊
Song is good but the set is low budget and the cameraman missed the point of a choreography video 😵‍💫
fazer esse rebranding e não lançar um mv pra elas primeiro é uma burrada enorme Jyp sendo jyp....
savanna kinda white washed bro
those vocals wow who are they 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Devoraron❤ Reinas✨ las amooo
最高です！！心待ちしてたよ！！ カムバックありがとう😭🎉🎉 めちゃくちゃかっこいい👍
I love jyp girl groups ugh
Omgggg❤❤❤
Who tf are these😂 not even kpop😂
Camilla's high note at the end 😢❤
ずっと楽しみにてた！ 曲めっちゃ好み
Que lindas chicas <33
i thought it said commies and i got excited. girl's communism
Ummm My face was literally WOW 😳, It's sooo good omg ❤❤
Camila shows the vibe of Beyonce
❤❤❤❤
This song ateee
JYP .Why don't you spend more money on Girlset ?
Savanna vocal sounds legit killing
Guys, I don't know but I didn't like the mv, they wear the same clothes, video phone and dance in the same place with only one camera maybe I didn't expect this, they deserve more!
Omgg
Camils is BOP in vocal, visual, dancing. Camila gonna be Beyonce soon
지금껏 본 JYP MV중에서 가장 저예산 MV네 JYP 제발 Girlset에 돈 좀 투자해라
Go Go My Girl Girlset
Missing Vcha's vibe 😢
Savanna owns this era.
Im a fan of littlemix, its like kpop version of littlemix. Goodluck girlset
Bisa stop dengan lagu pendek gak sih?😔 Lagu bagus tapi durasi nya cuma sebiji jagung
17 months I've waited, and it was worth the wait
Esta muy simple el sect 😢
Savanna look at you! Who knew you had those vocals!❤❤
Gorgeous
ATEEE OMG
Let’s go!
オーディションも見ていなかったしVCHAも興味無かったんですが、GIRLSETのファンになりそうです！
I hope jype gets ads for the main mv Promotion is important cuz how will people find out about this bop if they ever see it???
I thought that they will post a normal video but this is choreography video 😢  And this is so short music.
Elas estão maravilhosas, com uma energia vibrante como sempre, mas acho que a jpy deveria ter se esforçado mais para ter compondo uma música melhor e ter colocado mais cenários, porque tem grupos maiores com mais cenários em vídeos de performances...
Streammmmmm
No mv?
Are you kidding me!?!?!!? This is so goooooood
❤❤❤❤❤😊😮🎉
Wow girls! you improve so much, and that music is perfect 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
why new girl group nowadays concept looks like S.L.U.T
Still questioning why JYP choose toddler to debut in a global market girl group. If they using this kind of concept from the first time they will big
How can a 2-minute song *EVEN HAVE A BRIDGE?* I'm low-key impressed. Either way, it's a lot like my style now. Loved it. ❤
HOT SONG ❤🫦
Wishing the best!!
おかえり。待ってたよ。
close enough, welcome back katseye💗
So what's the fandom name?
Omg yaass gals!!!
I'M PREGNANT
What a banger girls!!❤❤
wasn’t sold on savanna in the original group but this concept and music style suits her so well. she stole the show for me here!
Cadê o mv?
COMMAS! COMMAS!
Congrats on your Debut Girlset
So gooood I love it. I think I’ve been waiting for it to come for a month and fainally loved it. I hope they release the next song relly relly relly love it
WHERE THE MV?
slayyyyyyyyyyyyy
This is a masterpiece
The low budget is speaking
Dos minutos. Ojalá vuelvan las canciones de 3 minutos en adelante.
So short
The way they each bring their vocal tones to the song, you have to appreciate their journey. Welcome back!
savana😍😍🥰
おかえりーー！！待ってたよ♡
1:41 THIS PART??
I love this omggg
Honestly the song is not bad at all but i would have enjoyed it more if they didn't spoil the whole chorus which is literally half of the song🫠
I LOVEEEEE THE CONCEPT 😍😍😍
0:32 THIS EATS
Yessssssss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
328k
ITS SO GOOOOODDDDD FR FRRRR🎉
low budget but atleast we got a redebut
696k
328k
ATEEEEE, THE QUEENS ARE BACK
Where's the MV version?
안무버전이구나ㅋㅋㅋ 난 또 1년 가까이 쉬게 해놓고 뮤비 세트 달랑 한개 인가 하고 깜짝 놀랬네 진심 ㅋㅋㅋ 노래 왜케 좋냐고
WOWWWW
MV?
We need mv not cheo
Jyp where's the budget...seriously 😒
これめっちゃ良くない？！！今度こそ成功してほしい本当に応援してるт т
wow amazing
Well done Be proud of this accomplishment  Very happy with music and dance
U guys ateeee
The vocalsssssssss
サバンナのボーカルスキルの進歩が半端ない！！
Heollyyy crap???!!! They look so good and the song is a banger😭❤
Camila owns this shit! I don't care
OMFG THIS IS AMAZING!?!? GIRLSET is BACKK AND BETTER THAN EVER!!! This is amazing!!! Kendall really caught my eye, I think she’s my new bias now😝!! Lexies dancing was actually AMAZING!! Savannas vocals were OVER THE ROOF OML!! And Camilas high note😍😍
Vocals are eating
노래가 너무 좋다!!!❤
I hope JYP treats them well this time...
I am overwhelmed. i can see myself dancing on this
Kendall and Lexus are really good.
I get understand why it's short. Its like their pre-debut track.
GIRLSET IS THE MINDSET!
OMG the choreo ATEE and I can’t wait for the MV!!
Savannah and Camila ate it up
Gosh it was short but perfect. Loved this so much
did they forget there should be a MV too?
😮 this is so ass… imagine waisting talent in such a horrible song….
This song is perfect ❤
STREEEEEAAAAAAMMMMM
camera is ASS
GUYS STRIVE TO 10mil views
They grew up in every sense of the word.
Jyp needs to start spending some money on girlset
Ateeee
カッコよすぎ！
achei estranho a fluidez entre o pre refrão e o refrão...parece sei la que o refrão entrou antes do tempo que tinha algo antes...e assim, curtissimo ne, e sem MV...o jyp ta fazendo oq? um experimento com elas? eu to torcendo muito pelas meninas mas a empresa está deixando a desejar. Com a super divulgação nas mídias achei que era algo mto mair do que foi.
i want to like it so bad ;^; the girls look great, and they sounds great, but it just doesn't hit th mark for me ;^;
yesss!!
For new fans:  0:05 Camila 0:12 Savanna 0:20 Kendall 0:37 Lexi
😢😢😢
Song is so good but why MV as choreography?
おかえり♡
They are so beautifull omg
この子達は完璧なのにこれはひどい…JYP何してんの？？ちゃんとしたMV作ってよ 予算が足らんくてもカメラワークとかでさぁ何とかならないわけ？？ぶっちゃけこれだけだったらこの子達もファンも怒っていい案件でしょ
Choreography version but you keep zooming into their face so we can’t actually see the choreo??? Great, thanks 👏
All these it’s short comments but when touch came out yall ate it up! 😭 and it’s like 10 seconds more that’s it no hate but guys please!
遂に！ダンスレベルが格段に上がってる！ 復活できて本当に嬉しい。
Omg me duele que sea tan corta, es mil veces mejor de lo q esperaba
0:56 LEXUS SLAYYYY❤❤❤ i love her 🛐
Finallyyy
Lindas 🔥
Girlsssss
ate
AINNNN Q TUDO
Bravoooooooo 👍👍👍👍
I like itt
vchaも好きだけど、こいつはそれを優に飛び越えている気がする＋最後のチン！がitzyみたいでエモいのも◯
welcome back girlies!!! so happy for you all!!!
A Kendall está uma coisa assim destruidora
Wait so vcha redubuted with new name? After kg and kaylee left
THE SONG IS SO GOOD WHY IS IT SO SHORT❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢
THATS IT BRUHH
Why you post choreography video first instead of official one? That's weird
Another short song 😢😢😢
おかえりなさい！！ 歌もダンスもパワーアップしててびっくりした…たくさん練習したんだろうなぁ 日本から応援してます！
so goodd<3
NO WHY IS IT SO SHORT
JYPへ 言われてんぞ？ “SPEND SOME MONEY ON ME”
fire🥵🥵🥵
🫶🫶🫶🫶
it’s givinggg❤
BIAS UNLOCK KENDALL
ONG- YES THANK U JYP FOR FIVING THEM A MATURE CONCEPT
KEEP IT ALL MY GIRLS
WEEE LOVEEE YALL
This video doesn't  look like it's made by a multi- billion company. SPEND SOME MONEY ON THESE GIRLS! If anyone gonna say it's just a choreo vd , GO LOOK at katseye's garbriela performance vd.They used multiple backgrounds , high quality camerashots and the girls are SHINING. No wonder their performance video surpassed the mv in  views.
ILYYYYYY GIRLSETTT
Hermosas todas las chicas. No solo eso, tienen mucho talento. ❤❤❤❤
Amazing song! Awesome work ladies! Now JYP, spend some money on them like they deserve and drop a real MV
Wait where’s the actual mv not choreo 😢
Okayyy Little Mix daughters
Waited doo long to only get a choreography video? It's unfair for my girls
レベル高い！ 鳥肌立った！
The song is actually pretty good but at 2min? Also, more effort/creativity needed on the MV. I've seen MV shoot out door running around on an Iphone so much better.
Where is “if you wanna roll with me better match my energy”
Miss A vibe❤️‍🔥
cool
Wow.  All beautiful and sexy.
かっこいい❣️
더 잘 될꼬야 ~ 화이팅
Very talented
I genuinely can’t stop listening, it’s so good!
Finally a group that does everything original not like katseye steeling and remaking songs, Im a new fan added.
I loved the girls' work, their dancing, vocals, costumes, etc. But it's a disappointment that you give your new international group that's about to debut a 2:02 song and it doesn't have an MV.😊
❤❤❤
come on guy lets screem  it
no mv?
Noooo 2 minutes? Why? 😢
a vocal group I love
ITS TOO SHORT JYPE!!!!
The whole video is just close ups of the faces, they put a choreography for a reason
Lexi's voice is so addicting 😍 she deserves more lines
JYPE trying to release songs that has 3 minutes duration challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
I think the waiting was Wort it❤
I guess jype are tasting the waters to see how they do before officially spending money on them 😅, smart move but we still need a mv not just choreography mv.
Like jyp alway do this they alway make the debut look so cheap for some reason no hate to the group tho
OMG KENDALL SHE'S IMPROVINGGGGG
💕💕💕
Volvéis a plancharle el pelo a savanna y me corto las venas
so VCHA OT4 now ?  wow i am shock
💕💕💕
JYP, the group suffered a lot in the company, to come back with a song of less than 3 minutes and release a video performance before the official MV, not to mention that they released the entire chorus of the song 1 month before the release, how old is the child who is managing the group?
Love it! 🔥🔥🔥 Such great vocals and performances, showing much growth and confidence. And knowing they’ll be writing their own songs - Love that! 🤩 Excited to see what comes next 😊🎉  A Stay, supporting GirlSet 🫰🏼
this is amazing but whre is the mv?
What does commas mean though
Ayesss❤❤
my girls deserve better 🥺💜
my girls deserve better 🥺💜
The queens are back hope they get treated better girlset are the mindset
Ayeee girls ate
my girls deserve better 🥺💜
my girls deserve better 🥺💜
THIS IS SO GOOD BUT SO SHORT WTH THIS IS SOO GOODD AND.TWHY LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND BADDIES AND THIER VOCALS ARE EVEYTHING
The star quality is so insane WHAT!!?
savana
Guys 1M is not too hard  Let's STREAM!
I missed these girls! So excited to see what's to come
All of them are amazing and I didn’t expect her to sound like this 😍 0:05 0:13 0:21 0:55 🔥 I’m so shocked!!  Also me hearing Katseye first of course I was thinking “ Another katseye” so it’s easy to compare BUT I am impressed.  I kept seeing their videos on instagram waiting for more and yes 0:33 I know no one owns a dance move but of course they gnarly different variation.  It’s not surprise that katseye moves are being use by these other kpop groups with different variations and that’s fine because they’re hot right now.  Anyway, I can’t wait for Girlset MV.  I’m definitely stanning this group and with them being from JYP!  All of them catches my eye and I kept looking at her 0:07 but I found my true bias 0:38 she came 0:44 she came in like a snake in the grass 0:54 she is just EVERYTHINGGG OMG who is she? maybe it’s the black short hair 😭 I only Stan two kpop groups with one being twice and my bias is Jihyo 😂 and yes I like others. Oh and her my bias wrecker she is so pretty 1:23 she has to be the visual? Her line 0:49 right here instant like for me ❤  I’m really liking this group concept and vibe ✨ 0:14 1:26 one more thing she is a little firecracker 🧨!!!
The vocal >>> omg slayyyyy❤❤❤
Muchos éxitos a las chicas en esta nueva etapa de su vida❤
GIRLSET setting the bars HIGH!
give savannah some edges 😭
ITS PERFECT
Please don't make the songs this short
Why is it so short? I'm so over songs being under 3 minutes. I enjoyed what's there but come on
OXE cade o MV?
omg savanna
Jyp really screwing them up, I feel so bad, girls runnnn. U guys are so talented, don’t accept this shitty treatment
มาปั่นยอดวิวกันค่ะ😂😂❤❤❤❤
Peak or Floop?
Yay our queens are back
Is there going to be a mv?
キタキタ😭❤️この4人で正解だった🫶ここまで長かったから泣ける😭
is there no music video..?
I love them it's a good starting song but I wish they would have released the emotional songs they wrote first like I don't know maybe 2 of those songs randomly without teasers or the date being confirmed. It would have been nice to just to open YouTube then boom girlset. I feel like an emotional song would be setting the tone of how they felt what was going on in their minds during that time of isolation I don't know man I feel like most of us would've loved that JYP omg I don't know if you don't know that there's something called marketing like you keep failing to do that all the time 😢  Love the girls I can't wait for what's more to come.❤
Eu amei a música e a coreografia  ❤🥰
I’m gonna get flamed for this. But what is is this 2019 itzy reject ahh song 🙏🙏
I like commas💓🎉
The song is really catchy and your voices are beautiful.  Good luck for your new beginning!
😍😍😍😍😍
😭I didn't expect the song to be so terrible, I was ticking off something else. 😭
loveeee
It sounds like a bad english translated song, JYP should focus on kpop groups.
Camila voice!!!
BEST THEIR SONG!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I LOVE YOU GIRLSET

そりゃKATSEYEがあんなに売れたらこの路線で行くしかないよなあ
明らかに上手くなったし曲の当たり所が良さそうで本当に頑張ったんだろうな。これでちゃんと事務所が押し出してくれることを祈るよ。
They all improve a lot 😮💗🤌🏻💓💓💅🏻👍🏻👍🏻💜💜🎀🎀🎀
This ate. To good to be this short.
The song, the choreo and the girls areee sooooooooo PERFECT
❤❤❤

Too short💔💔 let me find a corner to sit first😭😭. Beautiful song!!!!!!!!
285k
1:40 that high note😍🔥

JYP por eso es que uno le coge odio, porque hacer una canción de redebut de apenas 2 minutos  y tampoco le hacen un vídeo como manda la ley y después se preguntan porque esa compañía está cayendo en gusto popular
🔥
THEY SLAYED IT🔥🔥
Im really excited for more of their songs frrr
These girls must have been practicing for so long and so hard after they’d been abandoned by the company. Props to them, this is awesome
Why is to short😭😭 the song is sooooo good
soo worth the waitt, can’t wait to see where GIRLSET goess ❤
This song it’s just SO GOOD like hello? This what we’ve been waiting for 1 year😭❤️ Welcome back girls❤️❤️❤️
omg Savanna’s vocals have gotten SO GOOD
The way the song talks about spending money and the whole mv is just one set and clearly no budget at all 😭😭😭😭
正式カムバックじゃなくて先行シングル扱いなのかな？カムバックもすぐ来そうだねー
حبيباتيييي💕💕💕
I loved them since the first debut song and DO NOT miss treat them again they don’t deserve that
THEY ATEEEEE !!!!❤
is there an official mv? or only choreography mv atm?

PERIOD GIRLS YALL ATE THAT 🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️🤏🤏🤏
めっちゃいいとおもう。 パワー系のほうが似合う。 金髪で黒のボトムはいてる子めちゃめちゃチアリーダーぽい。  エスパとはまた違う重量感じるパワー感すき。
LOVE Girlset
Are they getting an M/V or not? And hopefully their debut song is different, this isn't terrible but way too short and the transition between verses and the chorus is a little rough
她們不會韓國出道打歌嗎? 正式的MV在哪裡
؟؟
Mv when
Apoyare a mis niñas, les deseo lo mejor, una clreografia muy entretenida y la cancion igual, todas se ven super bonitas pero Camila y Savanna se ven bellisimas
❤❤❤
43 thousand likes for vcha is crazy
ATEE
YAAAAAYYYYYY
I want Kendall's photocards so bad... 🥰Vcha never had a physical release, so I hope this time around they do it!
Prefiro as meninas do TWICE
Is this a global girl group
It's too short, but perfect.
I'm like COMMAS
У меня много вопросов к JYP

I love this song it's so catchy but I do wish for to be longer
No Kaylee - No Stan...

I came expecting nothing and was truly amazed, the melody, the harmonies, the dance and that high note, definitely a really good song pretty solid for a re debut, pls give the song the proper advertisement jyp 🙏 t
公に出ない間ずっと練習して努力してたんだね、絶対報われてほしい
Where the hell is that pre chorus from the teaser snippet looool
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is soo good and satisfying! I wish them the best success - they definitely didn’t need lazy KG aura.
노래 좋고 안무 좋고~
Las amo mucho chicas, no saben cuánto las extrañé
戻ってきてくれてありがとう！！！全力で応援する！
revelmixes revamped this good tho
Wait what who is this this song banger I like it
覺得現在變四人團體反而每個人的特色音色都表現出來 曲風跟形象也不一樣 蠻喜歡的❤
Красотки! В этом составе им прям подходит более взрослый концепт ❤🔥
where is Vcha and kaylee 🥺
I really like it so much!😭💙 "YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ME"
this is incredible ! luv u girlset !
YASSS GET IT GIRLSET
Great short song for an opening and rebrand!!
良いよー！凄ーく良いよー‼️
too good to be 2 minutes :')) please make it longerrrr
surprisingly i actually like this song, i thought it would be a bit strange since it was only 2 minutes
Go get it girls!!
Ooooh I need moreee, please please more content and music from theeemmm
I'm so proud of you. You deserve everything, I'll support you till the end.
Only 2 minutes yet it has quite literally everything: 2 verses, 2 choruses, a bridge, a third chorus and a dance break?!?!? And it’s also hella catchy?!? Welcome back my girls!!!!
savannah shoulder muscle 😲
Savanna is @annita?
Soooooo cool
Sorry but a redebut and is only a choreography version?? They are not even trying
Now it make sense why HYBE rushing their next global girl group with actual Caucasian member
There are no clips??
This is actually gooooood and I wanted more🤧😍 I'm glad they are back with a bang🔥
Wheres the MV?
I don't think I like it 💔
Wooooow!!!!🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Way too short, I think... Idk... Am I the only one who didn't like it? They slay, but the lyrics are definitely a big no.
I didn't even know them, but now I love them. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s very Katseye…
Excuse me?! 😭🔥
ココナッツフェスのときA2Kの広告たくさんみたな〜 どんな形であれおかえりなさい
Orçamento de uma coca e uma coxinha
This is the first time for me to find out about GIRLSET and I loveee them
I thought they are separated from jyp?
That's so good guys
Go girls!!!
I missed them! But they've improved. Love this song and their new concept.❤❤❤
Oque a Anitta tá fazendo aí em ? Hahaha
Love the comeback but it's so short!! 😭😭
Oh that choreo ATE🍽️!!
What is wrong with the shaky camera
Sexyになって帰ってきたね！！ とってもカッコいい！😊
THE CHOREO THE VOCALS MY GIRLS DEVOURED I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR EVEN MORE SONGS
GIRLSET'S VOCALS AND VOICES ARE SO TRULY A INTERNATIONAL TREASURE EVER PERIODT.
GIRLS ENERGY ❤
Remember this is a reintroduction and rebrand...Song and vocals are amazing!!! Its short because they want to see how everyone receives  them...after that they will release albums, promote and perform
4 VOCALISTS, 4 ALL ROUNDERS, 4 DANCERS, 4 ACES, 4 RAPPERS, 4 MEMBERS, 4 QUEENS, 4 VISUALS. YES THIS IS GIRLSET THE BEST NEW IDOLS AND NEVER DISAPPOINTS US
Se me hecho hasta corto
hopefully this group gets some hype. hope they get treated well
we want vcha.
i think they're still testing to waters on how the public will react to this so if you want them to give more make this video successful
GIRLSET IS THE BEST GLOBAL AND POP GIRL GROUP EVER PERIODT.
LET'S GOOO GIRLSET ❤❤
ヘアメイク変えてめちゃくちゃいい！！
i already love this song놀라운
It’s so good to be short
Savanna looks a bit like Anitta
ATEEEEEEEEEE❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Savanna ?? Stop flirting with me…..🫦🫦🫦
Vibe katsai is blowing
WHY SO SHORT GUYS ??!
They ate the vocals, dance, stage presence all was on point
I hope jyp close down and shuts down cuz they are so useless
1:40 Camila’s vocals?!!
I LOVE THIS, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR DEBUT GIRLSET ❤️‍🔥
Wait, no official MV?
As a STAY..hoping for great success for GIRLSET...make sure to keep supporting them...str3am the mv and str3am the song on all str3aming platforms

I just know that this group is gonna be very famous.
WHERE'S THE MV!!!
Why so short??😢

EYEKONS HERE FOR SUPPORT GRILSET
Kateye
ついに出てきました🗣️💕
❤️‍🔥🤩
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
おかえり！ いつか日本でも活動してほしい😊🇯🇵❤
Os deseo lo mejor a todas tmb a las k no están ya en el grupo 🎉🎉
Let's GO, LEXI, CAMILA, KENDALL, SAVANNA! ❤❤❤
they're testing the water with only the choreo vid? idk but looks like there won't be an mv.. :(
AMAZING SONG WOW 🔥 Glad to say I'm here to Stan Girlset from the start 🫶
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤
omggg the dance break?! I loved it so much 😭😍 girlset is the mindest
WHERE IS THE MVVVVVVV
My bff ❤😊🥰😍
控えめに言っても最高なんだけど
It kind of sounds like an Itzy song.
Where is mv?!?!
Bro there are Ugly than Katseye 🥱😒.
No literally they walked so others can run. They are the blueprint.
Wow, our girls are back❤
シューズのコルセットキター！！！！
I think they deserve more. They're so talented to be left behind. It's just a background, only one cloth for everyone in a short video, not even the Only One choreo was so cheap.
WOW savanna has improved so much since a2k, her vocals are beautiful 😍!!!  Love them <3
too short, even though it has a bridge, it feels rushed... But I love new sound for them, GIRLSET Let's goo!
2 minutes? I get ads on YouTube longer than this song 😭
❤
vcha가 돌아온건가요?  응원합니다
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
MV please
THE VOCALS AND DANCING IS SO AMAZING!!!
再デビューなんだから先にコンセプトを明確に表したMVを公開すべきでは？　Choreography Ver.の撮影場所はMVのセットなんだろうけど、これを先に見せられるとチープ過ぎて、、😭😭😭
GIRLSET could be the next Littlemix ❤️👑🎉
OMG KENDAL IMPROVED
ずっと待ってたよ🥰 これからたくさんのコンテンツ待ってます！！JYPさんよろしくお願いします❤️‍🔥🎉
Kendall 👄👄👄
Es buenisima creo que esta cancion merece mas visistas😊
I like it way more than I expected!! It's on repeat!! and I love the coreo!! <3 fighting girls!!
I need an extended ver with more of the ending part, please, and thank you 😊
Look, I was excited about the teasers and photos... I was too anxious for today, and I was looking forward to it: what a good, incredibly good surprise. It was fantastic, everything Congratulations to girls and more to come.
This is good their facial expressions improved even the vocals, this is a good comeback start
Choreography Ver.ってことは、他のversionもあるのかしら
2 minutes ☠️and no MV after teasing the song for a whole month BRUH... I literally hate JYP and it's so repetitive too.... I mean I'm glad they've finally redebuted, the song is really good but it sounds like an ITZY repackage and in still annoyed that there is no MV ☠️
It's fire but why it's only a dance vide not mv
WAIT GUYS! I did not expect it to be so good 😭😭 Omg slapped my face with those vocals😭😭😭🤏🏽🤏🏽❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
レクシー、カミラ、サバンナ、キャンドル、よくここまで耐えたね。みんな痩せちゃって心配。これから、いいことたくさんあるように祈ってるね。
OMGGGGG THEY SOUND LIKE OLD ITZY EVERYTHING IS PERFECT
this song is so good, also their vocals improved a lot💖✨
Omg Kendall you so slay!!!
I went to check out the group they said would be better than katseye, and from their first song, I was like, 'No way they’re gonna reach that level.' But still, it kinda hit me in the feels even though I’m a katseye fan. Their voices are literally nice, but the song’s short, and their label is ignoring them, plus they don’t even have a music video, which is unfair to them.
Bro where is mv? Good song but it's too short.
the best
hot garbage ?
It's is good  than I thought.
This is a really good song, i hope they become successful
OMG this is the real shit 😭
My biggest "complaint" with this song is THE INSTRUMENTAL IN ALL THE TEASERS PACKED SO MUCH MORE OF A PUNCH 💯🔥 Does anyone else notice a significant decline in the audio quality of this video? Like was it a good song? Yes. But I DIDN'T ACTUALLY FEEL ANY HYPE UNTILL ABOUT THE LAST 30 SECONDS HONESTLY 😔  Edit: Compared to the Official Audio on streaming platforms, THE MIXING ON THIS VIDEO SUCKS ASS. GUYS, THE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL AUDIO IS SOOOOOO MUCH CLEANER FUCK THIS PERFORMANCE VIDEO.   That being said, I stand by my earlier statement y'all. FOR A RE-DEBUT THIS TRACK IS SO MID. JYP, UMG FUCKING DO BETTER AND GIVE THESE GIRLIES A PROPER AND LONGER SONG!!!
Not bad, but there’s still a lot of work ahead in terms of promotion — like appearing on variety shows of various cringe levels. Let’s just say… I’m intrigued
ANOTHER TWO minute song, shame on everyone stop this. Twice too with THIS IS FOR and most of their songs on that album.
girlset 가즈아~~!!! 🎉
I love it🤩🥰😍😘🩷
Очень крутооо❤❤❤
I love it
This song gotta start paying rent for living in my head
kendalll
is this the mv??
I was trying to make a random edit and this popped up and  I dramatically gasped and said  FINALLY GURLSET CANE BACK
The song is good enough but why do they make videos on a low budget.. totally they dance in a small room like how??
I love the song, I love them, I love the new style, I love everything 💖 I admit that all the spoilers ruined the surprise a little for me, I love so much seeing the choreography and hearing the song for the first time since the official MV. I love you girls❤❤
I will miss VCHA BUT THIS GIRLS ARE SO GORGEOUS  WE STAN
i cant breathe with that small size of mv set hahahahahaha
あなた達4人は最高です❤ 世界が気づくのもすぐです。 どこまでも弾けて下さい🎵 イギリスとかオーストラリアでうけそうな気がします。
Omfg
CAMILLAAAAA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's 2 mins of my life I'm not getting back. We don't need another group like KATSEYE. 👎
初見です。再始動したグループなんですね？色々な事情やファンの感情があると思うのですが、それはそれとして4人の身体ひとつあればあんたの視線を奪うことなんて簡単だよ って感じのかっけぇパフォーマンスですね。
Support them they hard work for this🎉
This is actually good despite being too short. I hope people give them another chance.
Releasing the dance version before the official music video seems like a deliberate strategy — perhaps a way to embed the meaning of the title track, ‘Commas’, more deeply in the audience’s mind.
お帰りー
Vcha is gone, so GirlSet can soar!  ❤
These girls are no kidding! Great vocals, visuals and dance❤️🔥🥳
oh wait the song is just too good and the girls are hella talented too I'm gonna stan this group from now on
Go girls nailed it ❤
Deserve to this group
I thought we getting an mv
I don't like it idk why but it's just not my type but chorus is my favorite part ❤
Where is the mv?
They did them dirty
THIS IS SO GOOD
Their vocals are awesome 👍
Great song! ❤
damnnn, it's a good thing they rebranded, or else their talent will go to waste💞💞💞💞 I missed them so much, I love thiss
انا فان عربي واو الغني جنن ولا غلطه من الصوت و الملابس و مكان التصوير واو كل ماتخلص اعيدهه واو ‏‪1:43‬‏

Not only in Peru tremendously. Vocals are so stable from Savannah and Lexi.🖤❤️‍🔥
الكيبوب خرب من دخل بي الاجانب
ATE OMG
I was not expecting the song would be that good !
This is pretty good
No music video??
this song is too good to be this short 🥺
LEXI   SAVANAH  KENDALL  CAMILLA
Вообще не постарались над песней😂
Elles sont punis pour avoir fait seul décor et avoir une musique aussi courte??? Le son il tue mais fait qu’ils investissent pour elles hein
Yes! This is exactly what I expected from them, totally beyond and far above! I love the groove of the song! western but still kpop vibes.
LOVE THE SONG its just it is REALLY SHORT :(
The song is so good they atee❤
GIRLSET WORLD DOMINATION!!!!!
리브랜딩 잘했음. 맞는 옷 입은것 같음
อาจจะยังน้า
めちゃくちゃ、良い！！！
such a good songg
tea body
GIRLSET IS THE MINDSET  (edit 1: ty for 10 likes!)
캣츠아이 대항마같은 그룹으로 만든건가
I'm worried for this girls. For their health and situation.
yay!!! ive been waiting for ts !! its so good!!
I thought we were getting a MV … this is a good debut song.
too short
Actual vocals tho……finally from a global group….no gnarly needed
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MORE
❤❤❤❤
The vocals ✨👑
ATE, DEVOURED, LEFT NO CRUMBS
So good❤
Yassssss
LOVE IT IT'S AMAZING
新しいスタートだね😭❤️みんなかわいい！！！！！
I wish jype had put some more efforts to it.
Where is the MV 😢
THE TINNGLES THAT I HAVE LISTENING TO THIS OMG
They are so good I think in getting s new stsn ti gi along with straykids
I feel like the chorus is a bit disconnected from the rest of the song, but it's still a good debut song
실력 노래 포맷 다 좋다.... 근데 JYP!! 비디오 이게 최선입니까? 그 누구보다 세상 멋지게 뽑아야 되는 거 아닙니까? 아.. 정말 마음 아프다.. 애들 누구보다 잘되야 하는데..... 하아.... 설마 뮤비도 Choreography Ver.으로 끝나는 건 아니겠죠?
i havent had such a good time in a while ....thought kpop was about to die... anywaysss...'spends some money one me'  stuck in my mind!!
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉 It's out
They are so good. Their voices blend so well. The song is good. I’m loving it!!! ❤❤❤
This is so good mashallah
The highnotes are insane..
dissapointing
yeah, katseye better…
MY GİRLS BACKKKKKKK
cant wait for these girls to go worldwide
First of all, I really love the more mature vibes of the song. Second, I LOVE THE SONG. The girls are absolutely amazing. Wishing GIRLSET nothing but seccess.
WHYS THIS SO SHORT?? THIS IS SO GOOD
The song is soo good but i got scared at the start😭
Amoooo
this was everything!! i better not see one complaint !!!
LA HIGH DE NOTE DE CAMILIA OMGMGMHMHHHH
La voix de Kendall sur le premier complet ??? J’aime
i just KNEW it would be this short
I hope they are promoted properly this time
I LOVEEE !! J’avais peur de pas aimer parce que je l’avais trop entendu sur Tiktok mais finalement j’adore !
I guess I'm early
The song slays and JYP done such a nice job but i just have i complaint and i don't mean it in a rude way so please don't blame and anywas in my opinion jyp iss the best company and i really wanna join so the complaint is aren't the outfits a bit to revealing especially savanva. ( please don't take it in a rude way)
I did not expect the best JYP song in a while to come from this group.
The choreo is packed and the girls nailed it especially lexi in last chorus after that amazing bridge. This definitely feels like a introduction to girlset and start to more full project. I'm honestly pleasantly surprised how much i enjoyed it and looking forward to their future releases!
Don't mess with my mascaraaa~ really reminds me of XG
OKAY ATEE
Oh the choreo is so good imma learn THISSSS!!
JYP the least u could do for the girls not turning on you and creating lawsuits of their own is give them an actual budget and a real chance at success.
진짜 리브랜딩 하길 잘했다 전보다 훨훨 나음 근데 영상에 돈 좀 쓰지 그것만 아쉽고 노래 안무 잘 나온거같고 멤버들이 잘하네
Ey ey eyyaaay I Love it this group
Ouu if they go hot pink instead of red in their outfits, I think it would be sooo good.
Good luck girls, yeah another jyp group have member left the group, and the rebrand, but yeah if some member left the group from jyp usually the group will be more famous, i don't know why.
why is jyp so unoriginal😭
Welcome back!<3
I know they aren’t kpop (I’m unsure how there branding) but are we getting albums cuz I’ve wanted a Camila and Savanna pc for a while now I want a ot4 set but I need pc’s of my Latina girlies
uhhhh JYP needs to listen to their own damn song and put money on them cuz this 1 set, 1 outfit, 2 minute song, and no MV is giving low budget
Am I the only person that watched this and hated it? The lip sync is off and the production is awful 😳
Baile, canto tienen todo estas chicas 🎉
The song is good except thst last instrumental part at the end - could have extended and made it even more dancey for a dance break?? Too simple instrumental or maybe so quiet idk
This better than gnarly😛
Sounds like Ariana grande song ❤
They deserve a good mv and a longer song but they still ate 🔥
They are good, but the quality of the MV is very bad.
SLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
This song is sooo good I love it 😍😍😍
SPEND SOME MONEY ON MEEEE
Omgggg this is too good and catchy 🎉 1:57
Gives me xg’s mascara vibes
Always Vcha ❤😢
Love it but 2 minutes for a song isn’t sitting right with me. 😢
Too bad that Vcha didn’t get much recognition. Even I got aware about NiziU got recognition in Japan, though Vcha gonna be successful too.
WHY AM I KINDA OBSESSED
ほんっっっっっとうにこの曲大好き！！！！！！
YASSSSS
Lexus vocalsss!!! OKAAAYY?
Sheesh JYP, give these talented girls an actual MV & a song that's at least longer than 2 minutes... they deserve more than this!!
1M SOOOOOON🎉🎉🎉
so happy to see my girls again!
Devorando como siempre
Ironically JYP did NOT spend much money on them.  Barely a full teaser, song is only 2 minutes, not even a proper music video and not a lot of promotion… The girls deserve better!
가성비라 아쉽지만 곡이랑 컨셉은 데뷔곡보다 훨씬 낫다 핫한 언니들 데려다가 일본걸그룹 만든 거 보고 탄식했다 어느 본부인지 모르겠지만 본부장 잘라라
this is so short but this song is so GOOD
It can beat bp
#7 Canada #7 United States #13 Costa Rica #13 Panama #13 Peru #13 Puerto Rico #16 Russia #16 United Kingdom #20 Dominican Republic #21 Mexico #23 Honduras #24 Japan #28 Brazil #28 Ecuador #29 Indonesia #31 Bolivia #34 Saudi Arabia #36 Chile #36 Colombia #42 Guatemala #43 Australia
Honestly they shouldn’t have spoilt this song that much and waited that long to release it. I don’t feel that exited abt it anymore 😅
Beautiful 🤩👍🏽👏
OMG THAT’S SOOOO COOL!! I LOVE THIS NEW SIDE OF THE GIRL AND THE CHOREOGRAPHY ATE. I HOPE THEY PROMOTE THIS ON MUSIC SHOWS
❤
I loved this song so excited for more came back
🫶🫶🫶🫶
oh my God the best debut
❤❤❤
Louddderrrr!!!!!! Jyp entertainment sucks!!! They focus a boygroup to push through popularity but they have no talent like some other girlgroup of jyp entertainment like girlset twice itzy
Okay girl boss energy, i see you girlset.
So glad the girls are back ❤️ Proud of you all!
OMG I MISSS YOUUU GUYSSS AND I LOVEEEE THISSSS SOOOOOO MUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH❤❤❤
This songs a hit they deserved it in every single way 🎉🎉 congratulations GIRLSET I Know I'm new but I'm going to post this one my page
Kendall still had her sweet voice , i like her voice because haven't changed since a2k until now ❤
Amazing great job my girlies
ts fire
Wow, their voice colors sound 10 times better then other JYP groups already. What a waste of talent.
I LOVE IT
oye JYP..... no quiero ser esa persona pero.... un Choreography version video??????????? like SOLTÁ LA PLATA WACHOO eres parte de las BIG 3 del kpop y no te da por soltar un poco de guita para TU GRUPO GLOBAL que TU decidiste crear. Dales un video musical como se merecen, gasta todo y más por hacer que tu proyecto en el mercado estadounidense sobresalga como THE next girlgroup
Is this song to JYP? ‘Spend some money on me’. Guess they didn’t listen 😭
OH YAS, GET IT GIRLL YASSSSS QUENNS
再始動がんばれ！！from WithU
2 minutes?! Are streams really that important?
I loved this song ❤ But I really hate that the songs are so short now. 😢
애들은 너무 훌륭하고 노래도 좋은데 간만에 힘들게 리브랜딩해서 데뷔했 왜이렇게 성의가없지 진짜 일 누가하는건지 돈좀 팍팍써서 밀어줘야하는거 아닌가  너무한데 뮤비멋있게 내보내야지 뮤비도 안찍은거면 말이안돼는데
What's with the clip? Why isn't it super well shot?  (Don't haight!)🥲
the song, choreo & styling eat. thankfully the song doesn't feel that short even though it's only two minutes long. can't wait for more music from girlset!
Está mejor asi
There is no need to compare it with katseyes. I love girlsets as an idol concept. They are idols, not artists. I think this is more correct as an idol song✨ They 're good at singing, They have a beautiful face, and their dancing is cool✨ I love it✨
IT'S SHORT BUT I REALLY LIKE IT
They look like katseye 🙃
Please, let's make this song popular! We have to show JYP that they can become popular!
No fue el regreso que esperaba , este regreso el literal como el de blackpink osea sin ganas y si hacen falta kg y kaylee
Need a MV so bad
Wheres the mv😢
I love this song. Gurlllss what a vocal 🤌🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
What a cool song was released today!  I've been waiting for her very, very much and I'm glad🤩! JYP, please make these wonderful girls popular! Please believe in them! 😫🙏
It's so short but it's really good i hope we always get good songs but longer
GIRLSET FOR THE WIN
Always so short😢
01:40?
I love this song❤❤
GIRLSET dando look, baile, cara, pelo, todoo💗
完全体になった、完成したって感じだね！！！💓💓💓💓💓
Katseye and girlset have different concept. And I guess girset is doing fine for now. Looking forward to their further works.
Es super bueno pero dura muy poco😢
Where is the mv though?
Everyone's voice is beautiful, very outstanding.
誰？VCHAが改名したの？
Yeah, JYPE could spend some money here for sure…
still Kendall bias here ✋
Who them??? New gg??
待ってました🎉
OMG MY GIRLS ARE SO BACK! This song is SO GOOD 😱 THE VOCALS, THE VISUALS AND THE CHOREOGRAPHY I MEAN WOW!!! ❤ YOU GIRLS NAILED IT!
That high note gave me LIFE, miss Dr. Camila!
Just one thing I'm curious about. Are they adults yet?
La música está muy buena , pero no me esperaba en el vídeo solo coreografía  esperaba mucho más , pero igualmente las chicas la hicieron bien porque sé que se esfuerzan ❤
1:40 THE HIGHNOTE?! CAMILA THE VOCALIST YOU ARE
The song is short, but it's fantastic  with a great bridges!  But come on, it's a choreography video. At least show it properly.
they deserve to recognized
ok but next time better camera
You keep looking at me, looking at me, keep looking at me…
기다렸어!!
Okay..I'm addicted to Kendall's part..
0:52のレクシーの歌声めっちゃソリュン
im so proud of them, this is a new chapter for them and it shows the hard work, they have been through so much, all we can do is support them!!! Congratulations GIRLSET!!! 🥳🥳❤️❤️
Girlset = Temu Katseye
短くね？
Tbh, I thought Kendall might struggle with this concept, but nah she ate down I excepted everyone else to eat and they ATE DOWN   I'm so ot4, they're all FANTASTIC
Oh they ate and they all improved so much I can’t wait for more
sheesh idk what to say like, after all those shorts spamming the chorus every single time made this feel so empty. 2 minutes? 1 minute was the chorus we all knew, just 2 new verses and a high note, seems kind of lazy to me. yes they served faces, choreo was crazy with those chest movements, they are hot I know, but speaking of just the song, it was a lazy song that got burned with all the short content spamming the chorus. Hopefully they do better on the next songs, and its nice to see them out of the basement.
lowkey ended vcha's discography
May this be a new beginning  Always support you all! <3
Wow, I like the song 0o0
Como que no es un mv? JYP🕴
Wow wooooow.....Lexil!❤
Like I KNEW I was going to like the song but damn I LOVE this  Morreeeeeeeeeeee  I'm so SAT for GIRLSET
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe they just meant the choreo and song release and they somehow just released them a bit earlier than the 12am time for the 29th because there’s no MV and it’s past by 20 minutes 😢away
To be honest this song is good catchy and a bop the thing I’m gonna say is I think they are too pitchy overall like savanna’s vocal range fits the song better and lex too Camilla sounds like she’s trying to sing like Arianna and Kendall should have started the song instead of Camilla other than that they ate with the live vocals and thoes harms just belting out high notes is impressive and the production of this song just sucks like I love a raw vocal but it sounds too raw like no minor filters were put on the girls even in the choreography mv it sounds like they recorded it on smule sing but thoes are my notes as a fan just some notes not hating just wanted to share what I thought could have been better
Give us the MV you stinkers 🫵 Treat our girls right please.
Where's the mv ??
JYL please treat the girl well
Its way past 12 seriously where’s the M/V
kendalll ❤❤❤❤
와우 사바나랑 렉시는 몰라보겠네~~ 엄청 성숙햇네요 화이팅
never heard of them, i only know VCHA
Instead of mv it's choreography performance. It's okay, it's my girls anyway 💅🏻🤍🤍
We thought we were getting a mv
Почему это выглядит как кпоп инпаблик и съёмка на томдп уровне
Better than vcha. Addictive song. Katseye is still better for now.
Cheap production - it felt more like a dance video than an actual video. A good video would have created a greater impact… they won’t be around for long having KATSEYE around.
We thought we were getting a mv
We thought we were getting a mv
We thought we were getting a mv
We thought we were getting a mv
Creo que no habrá  MV
Amando esto, esperamos con ansias todo lo que viene 🎉
Well this is a banger
THEY'RE SO GOOD!! C'MON LEXI, CAMILA, KENDALL, SAVANNA 🔥
Las amo mucho❤
This song is way better than any of katseye songs,now the insane amount of money, that geffen and Hybe, are spending in promotion is gonna be the difference
1M go go
jyp… why is it giving budget 😭😭😭 i love these girls sm but i expected more.. they def deserve more than 1 set and 1 outfit…
Ayeeee this ateeee❤
待ってたよ！！
Vcha forever ❤😢
So talented!! Let’s keep up the support for these girls!!!❤
There’s no real MV? This is it!? Really JYP?
LOBAS,LOBAS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
please treat the girls well
The teaser they've been using to promote the song is the entire chorus 😢
The o to issue I have with this is the budget they used but hopefully the mv is better
미국서 결성했던 그룹은 해체했나? 소송당했더만
Every girl has a different vibe, I think it was a good idea to change from VCHA to GIRLSET, this debut was very impressive😍❤️‍🩹
YOURRR SOO BACKKK GURLSSS LOVE YOU ALL
Too short noooooooo.
Sprinkle Sprinkle music can only be sung in English because the fragile sk man ego would break
Omg this song is sooooo good ❤
I've watched this like 10times already, and I'm living for the pre-chorus the whole song. They are all shining; this concept fits them so well. I hope to see them go far in the industry. Also, Kendall is serving in the blond hair, and Camilla with bangs is stunning, so is Lexi with the black bob, and Savanna with orange Straight hair is my favorite look on her.
Please give us MV for this jay why pee
ATE JYPE BETTER BE TREATING THEM RIGHT
City girls but make it Kpop lol
My bias Kendall is killing this  I'm so proud of Kendall  Kendall vocals have improved alot
Hiiii
daha iyisini yapabilirdin jyp ama kızların looku çok güzel
Ok yeah now I’m confused because it’s past 12am PT and it’s the time they posted they’d have their MV out but it’s no where yet. Maybe there’s technical difficulties? Idk
This song would be Korean version with Twice...❤
This song is better than all song the other songs they sang . Love this one ❤
the video somehow made it to 2 minutes. No thanks. JYP failed again
The choreography holy crap?!! 🔥
OMGGGGF
Amazing girls, amazing voices, amazing song❤❤
Hey i mean the song slays but i was expecting a mv
no MV??
MV WHEN?
The worst part is that they will be comparing them with katseye
The mixing audio kinda off? What happened jyp? I hope it's only introduction song ❤ comeback with baddie song pls
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Girlset
오 뭐야 사진으로 봤을 때보다 다들 훨훨씬 예쁘고 노래도 좋은디?!
Back
AYEE GO GET IT, GIRLSET 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow savannah is amazing
Что за капирки кис оф лайф мне больше нравился их дебют как вича
where is the mv
THIS IS CRIMINALLY GOOD! Girls, you at least deserve a dance break or an extended part for that 🙌❤
LOVEEE YOU GIRLSET FROM FRANCE !!!❤
Where's the MV
How old are they?..
AH
おかえりー！日本から愛を送ります！
Sincerely this gives me Little Mix vibes 😭  this is so good, so smooth vocals and it’s so catchy ❤🙇🏻‍♂️💕
Dear god I always knew they had it all FR even on the show these 4 ranked in the top 4 in character. They always had such strong dancers between them and everything they showed on the show was insane. As soon as I heard Camilla sing on the show I wanted her to be the main vocal so bad😭 Their synergy together is perfect too probably because they are actual best friends and have been through alot together and they're all really nice sweet girls. Lexi starting to cry at the showcase, thanking everyone for being here still after everything they've been through, not knowing what would happen or if they would be able to do anything out of this when this is all they've wanted to do...they seriously deserve this and MORE.  One of the songs I heard on the debut showcase was so good it gave me chills, I cannot wait for new music! but this?? Oh she is already playlist this is such a bop; this and NMIXX × Pablo MEXE are on repeat🔂 🤭❤
No music video?
Best rebrand I’ve ever seen❤love it Girlset!
ATE DOWNN!!! I’m soo happy you guys are back. Like seriously I love the song and will be streaming everyday when I work out
Wow, the new rebrand is interesting.
0:49
Ok now I hope we get a live stage🥹🥹so proud of our girls definitely set the tone for what’s next😮‍💨🥳
it feels like dalla dalla by itzy😭
ONLY TWO MINUTES??? THIS IS CRIME. THE SONG IS SOOO GOOOOD!!!!!
jyp global girl group??? ALSO PLEASE NORMALIZE 3 MINUTES SONG AGAIN 😭 THIS IS TOO SHORT
I loved this for a song
So there’s no mv?
30 seconds in and already obsessed
katseyeになってもうた😢
JYP what are u doing with my girls , low quality me of the year
1:25 SAVANNA QUEEN 😍💕😋
AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
They lack charisma a lot. while transitioning from a more fresh cuter concept into something like more mature I thought they’d look better with it but ig I was wrong there’s no fun watching them. I loved vcha so much I’ll miss those those few pieces.
Heyy, where's the MV? Good song tho!
Omg Girlset!! They are finally here with this banger!!!❤
Now i need the mv This song is tooo good😢🎉 Congratulations to our girls for coming this far❤
Lexi.... you rock!!! I lafff yaaaa
Didn’t even give them a proper MV? Come on JYP…
Tbh, Girlset is a wonderful group but i don't want to see unfair areas, you should give Girlset a longer song cause the song actually sounded good. I wish Girlset would be like Vcha like i mean the happiness that they had, the song vibe but definitely not how the company treated them, but yes, I hope Girlset's future is as wonderful as other global girl groups. Wish you guys the best❤
i wish the chorus is fiercer or stronger. but anw, looking forward for what they'll do in the future.
🔥🔥🔥
JYP 팍팍! 좀! 밀어주세요. 걸셋(GIRLSET)
GIRLSET ❤
i LOVE this. ❤
걸셋(GIRLSET) 늘 ~ 응원합니다. 잘되길 바랍니다 🙏 걸셋(GIRLSET) 사랑해 😍
This is an amazing Song but it is to short😂 anyways i love it! Its a Perfect Comeback! Really!
걸셋(GIRLSET) 응원하고 사랑하는 사람 모두 손! ✋️
These girls have the perfect energy and vibe! Can't wait for what else they have in store ❤
I dont like..
This song is everything 🔥🔥🔥
HERMOSAASSS!!!!
THIS FUCKING ATEEE
AND THEY SHAKING ASS? THEY ATE DOWN YALL 😭
Entonces no tenemos mv y se ve de bajo presupuesto
WHAT COME AFTER SEVEN GUYS ? ✨
LET'S GO GIRLSET !! YOU ATE THAT 🫦👌🏻✨
So you’re telling me I should stan this group???  Okay then 🤪 💙
0:13 "You've been waiting patiently..." Yeah I have😅. I have been a stan since VCHA times and I'm here to support them as GIRLSET 🤩! Anyway, I like the song very much, it's quite short, but Camilla's high note slayed🔥and we even got a bridge and a little dance break🥳, yeey.
Ohk noted, what's the Fandom name now? I wanna join 🧎
Great job for my girlset❤❤
@jyp promote them nicely like other artists;)))
THIS SONG ROCKS!! 🔥🔥🔥  Smh at the hater comments saying JYPE cheaped out on Girlset with a ~2 min song -- such dumb comments! Apparently they been living under a rock since NewJeans has plenty of ~2 min songs that slayed. Shorter songs also give better streaming stats.
I can't forgive my self for not watching this live. This is the closest live thing that I could afford😂😢
❤❤❤
All girls looking very sharp so proud of them❤❤❤❤❤
Girlset debut is amazing!! i can’t wait for what’s to come🫶
WOMEN
We needed a mv @jyp
😊
WAIT IM VIBING
omg imma stannn!!!
Love girl setttt
devoraron amooorrrrr
Bad song
I'm really glad to see the girls return after so long! ❤
The song of the year!!!
For this to be the choreography version….the shots are too close
La gente debe entender q esto fue un adelanto de lo q se viene para girlset en esta nueva dirección musical y ya más adelante las canciones pueden durar un poco más pero esta me encantó es como para mostrarles al mundo lo q están hechas ellas
These girls never miss! HELLYEAHHH
Cool girl
DEVORARON REINAASSSS
I definitely manifested this😭😭😭 PERIOD!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
" I need moreeeeee" exactly I need MORE this is to short!!!
Wtf is this...
Después de todo se quedaron 💔💔
GIRLSET YOURE GONNA BE BIG
YAYY
I LOVE THIS SONG SM
VCHA big comeback!

GIRL SET ABOUT TO BE BIG
I love the song, It's a shame It's so short
is there no mv for this?
一人知らない子がいるなー思ったらサバンナか😂
Stays will be supporting GIRLSET ❤️
This was great! But to short 😢❤
i reammy miss theeeeem!!!❤❤
I love commas❤ I'm so happy that the girls are back
OMG the concept so suit all of them ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Agreed on who’s saying this song is too good to be this short cause DAM YALL ATE THEM VOCALS SM AND THE PERFOMANCE!?
Whoa lexie omg???? THIS IS STAR POWER
I loved the song and the choreography, but I would have liked an MV. I was really looking forward to it :( I also loved the passion and the girls' vocals too much. ❤
I mean I love the thing that in YouTube it's all positive comments but sometimes criticisms have to be taken. They have immense potential no doubt at all. But seriously what is wrong with their management. First of all, the song might be catchy to some people but this is not gonna be the song which can actually grab attention. Like the lyrics sound like you're asking for money in OF. Ridiculous. And seriously. They couldn't get any better set and style? What the heck is wrong with JYP... These girls have so much potential but they're making them flop.
wow all of them are shining
Amé esta canción, me encantó!!💗
Zavanna streight hair,,so preetty ❤❤❤
Even though it's only 2 mins i fell like it's a lot longer bc of coreografy
It giving little mix 2.0 love girl set❤❤❤
정신박약아들은 병원으로 보내고, 남은 터프한 소녀들은 케이팝의 새로운 역사를 계속 써야지!! ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
looks more to kpop sorry jyp you looks way more desperate this time
I just watched the whole livestream I’m so sad I missed it I was in a drawing session with my boyfriends family. First I want to say the song was FIRE 🔥 I love everything about it I can definitely see that each member had their own special moment and both vocals and choreo was amazing. I’ve been stanning since A2k and I know you girls have gone through a lot I’m just glad your back and looking happy as ever 🥹 also Kendall what’s your rank on valorant I wanna knowwww I think I have an addiction with valorant right now
2:02  too short
그동안 완전 이를 갈았구나! 노래 너무 좋다. 완전 흥해라!!
🫶🏻
Treat my girls better yall
SO GOOD, this is so good!!
aight when full album
OMG SLAY
THIS IS SO GOOD I WISH IT WAS LONGER
AAAAHHHH MY GIRLS ARE HEREEEE
I think this is just a song to build hype. The debut song is still not released like M/V and all those. Btw im obsessed with the songs
songs are getting shorter and shorter, soon will be under 2 mins.
Yo esperaba ya el vídeo oficial pero está increíble la coreo, me encanta!  Okay, tengo altas expectativas en sus nuevos proyectos.  I was already waiting for the official video, but the choreography is incredible, I love it! Okay, I have high expectations for your new projects.
When the girls have Beyonce energy and have soul to make good music but jyp cant promote lmfao
Mmm
Lyrically, the transition from 'Only One' to 'Commas' is wild. I bet these four girls have learnt from their previous relationships with their crushes or exes, whereas the former members are still with their partners. So, based on the songs, I'd say there are just four members (not in real life, though).  Well, KEEP STREAMING "COMMAS', guys. Girlset is the trendsetter
reinas
100% improved 100% dance 100% baddies!
I like the song
I justtt loveeee theee vocallllssss❤❤❤❤ kendallll😭🤌🤌🧿💗💗
JÁ É HIT NOS MEUS FONES DE OUVIDO
I don't mean to be misunderstood, but the choreography seemed simple. A few of the moves seem to have been taken from other choreographies. I don't know.
LINDAS LINDAS
ARRASARAM MT
อาจจจะยังน้า 😊
QUEENS SLAYYED🎉❤❤❤
WELCOME BACKKKK!!!! We have missed you!!!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Es demasiado buena necesito una versión más extensa
Not a huge fan of short songs but I must admit this one is perfect! We're getting a bridge, a high note, a final chorus and an outro!
最高過ぎる！！！！
됐어요. 이렇게 빌보드 10위권 입니다
GUYS I NEED HELP LIKE RNN😭 can u tell me thei names and how they look by tgei names??? PLEASE CAUSE I ONLY KNOW KENDALL CAUSE SHE IS MY BIAS
Increíble, hermosas
okay divas
Kendall is so gorgeous omg
I think the song is so short because they are testing the waters and wanting to see how fans react before delivering something AMAZING next!😊
They Atee!!So Hard!
KENDALL ❤
OMGGG
WAIT.... THIS IS LOWKEY A BOP
this song really showcases their talents and the new style really emphasizes their beauty. i feel for everyone involved that they went through hardships but its pretty obvious they all want to move on and focus on their music so i will be looking forward to whatever they put out in the future! good luck girlset!!
A música é curta, mas muito bem construída (como “this is for” [que é ótima] deveria ter sido. Gostei de primeira!  Obs: a Savanna é a minha bias (tá MUITO parecida com a Anitta nesse vídeo)
OMGGGG GIRLSET BACKKK
Need a real music video that’s a minute longer because this song is way too good ❤❤❤
don’t get me wrong they absolutely devoured but why post a choreography ver if 90% of the video is too zoomed in to even see the choreo? i’m not hating on the girls or the song!!!!
The song is really catchy
대박. 느낌 팍팍 온다. 작정했구나.  2세대 때의 그 특유의 독기 가 보인다.
Sii girlset las apoyamos en México 🇲🇽❤❤
Omg this song is sooooo gooood😍😍
the dance, the looks, the vocals, the song, the lyrics??!? the Commas?!??! SLAYYYY
Chicos si va haber mv a als 12 hora de los angeles o sea hay q esperar
lời trưởng thành hơn và vocal nghe mượt như nhung. slayyy
It's not bad, but the outfits are outrageous...
it's short :<
I really like this song🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
"But i need more"
0:51 her vocalllll 😫
Lapa de testa dessa anitta da shopee kk
Hay una que se parece a anitta?
Well my opinion JYP saw that katseye debuted with a hard, sexual concept and as their group vcha now called girlset nothing happened with their music they have done something similar to the concept of katseye, there are even several steps that seem to be gnarly but well in the end it is JYP that is going to be done
됐다! 애초에 이게 맞는거였다.  느낌 왔다. 이 컨셉이 맞아.
Es raro esto por que en el teaser se les puede ver en diferentes escenarios y vestuarios, si JYP les da promoción de la buena ellas pueden llegar a ser grandes
Here since A2K
floppp 😂 i don't like the song, Jyp being jyp
i do love an underdog so im really manifesting their much deserved success
❤❤❤❤
KATSEYE BETTER STOP COPY PASTE 🤮🐷🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮floppp, copy paste 🤮🙄🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 🤮🤮
JYPE, I have one complaint. Can you please stay away from the Konglish group names. You did so well up to Stray Kids.
tf is this shit
KATSEYE BETTER STOP COPY PASTE 🤮🐷🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮🐷🤮floppp, copy paste 🤮🙄🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 🤮🤮
110k? Why use ads here bro, Soojin is better youtube
I like the song
Mind you their stats as GIRLSET is already surpassing that of VCHA and this hasnt even been out for 2 hrs as yet. GIRLSET IS THE MINDSET!!
Camera work is shi and jyp this song was so good but you wasted its potential spoiling chorus and choreography before mv is INSANE
I like their vocals very much. Lets go!
I'M LIKE COMMAS ❤️❤️❤️🩷🩷🩷
You keep looking at looking at keep looking at me like you wanna
may quá mỗi người một màu giọng. vocal hay tuyệt ❤❤ bài này dễ nghe. ghe lại. thông điệp cũng hay
Why is so short? It's so good ❤
GIRLSET WILL BE FAMOUS 💜💜
this song is TOO good to be so SHORT💔💔
GO GET IT GIRLS
A 2 minute song and a cheap choreography video? JYP really said here’s 5 dollars good luck
Me gusta mucho ❤
너무 좋아요 😍
サバンナのビジュを元に戻してほしいな
1:02 what’s her name? all of my attention went to her she has that star power idk how to describe 😮😊
Not to criticize but the song was kinda underwhelming and short.... Though the vibe is on top, i was expecting a proper MV   Anyways the song is really good and the vocals are on top the line distribution is great..... Rooting for you guys
LIKE COMMAS !
Yeess Savanna’s vocal improvement??? She is the lead vocalist now.
Where's the MV tho?
YESSSSS
this and VCHA?
I'm the most impressed by Savanna vocally here. The song matches her tone very well. Also Kendall has the most distinct voice. It's only when she sings that I can tell it's her without looking. Lexi has also outdone herself vocally. I can tell. Camila's high notes are outstanding as always.
0℅ VCHA 100℅ GIRLSET
29/8/25 ( Friday ) 2.06 pm.  The girls literally calling out JYP to spend money on them :)  Also, this 2 min song is too short.  May the re-debut Girlset walks a smoother path than VCHA.  Fighting !
Katdeye and now this, now the koreans are black and usa Girls? Don't like
This come back is giving me Girlicious
They are with dance, visuals and vocals.... Literally so good comeback of these girls
Why is the song so short ? 2 minutes ?
goooood
OMG the song is really addictive I love it smmmmm❤❤
THIS IS SO LITTLE MIX, FIFTH HARMONY INFLUENCED, AND I LOVE
OMGD
so good
They all look so gorgeous✨✨✨ Guys support them
i'm gonna be honest. obviously this is not directed TO THE GIRLS, they are working, doing their best. this is about the company and JYPE USA..: I expected MORE. I expected a better song, the link between the song and the chorus is a bit weird, and the song has no meaning AT ALL, it is completely EMPTY, and futile. Also the recording of the choreo is AWFUL, zooming right up their faces, when a CHOREOGRAPHY VERSION of something usually has EITHER nice cool takes and angles OR EITHER a steady further camera but a nice environment with cool outfits. BESIDES THAT, did they really think listening to them wanting to be more mature and putting them four to SHAKE THEIR BOOBS WITH A ZOOMED CAMERA ON THEIR TORSO AND HEAD WITH TINY TOPS would the BEST aproach? like, really? the girls are BARELY 18, 19, and despite not being underage anymore, they are, yes, still kinda kids, they are just young girls starting, and these SMALL TOPS and them shaking their CHEST onto the camera like that is just NOT HITTING the right way. Really, JYP USA, work better. They all look stunning, but I rather have them in more covered clothes that look cool and snazzy than these "pick me pretenders" that are trying too hard to show themselves (again NOT ABOUT THEEEE GIRLSSS, just the concept and what the COMPANY DECIDED for their "debut/comeback as Girlset". Sincerely, I wish they all quit and would do something better either still into music or somrthing else. They deserve MORE than this RUSHED ATTEMPT of making them OTHER STUFF. Cuz this is obviously rushed. No promotions, just one song (cuz they needed one to justify the GIRLSET NEW BRAND ANNOUNCEMENT), and not even and MV when time was set to their debut. Also this excuse of a video. LA CKING. LACKING A LOT. OF SO MUCH. poor four girlies....  p.s.: WHY SOOOO MUCH EFFECTS over their pretty voices? it is so full of tunes and echoes and distortions..... ×.×
Been missing Savanna's voice!!! ❤
VOCALSSSS THEY ATEEEE
OMG I'M OBSESSED Y'ALL WHERE IS THE MV?
this rebrand is revolutionary ❤❤❤
Camila ❤️‍🔥 apoyo a las cuatro pero Camila siempre tendrá un lugar súper especial desde el programa es mi fav veamos esa coreografía increíble sus vocales mejoraron bastante por favor denle más amor y apoyo por que lo merecen JYP ponte las pilas
GIRLSET X SETTERS
YALLLL I MISS THEM SOOOOO MUCH IVE BEEN WITH THEM SINCE A2K SO I MIGHT HAVE BALLED MY EYES WHILE WATCHING THIS BUT THIS SONG IS AMAZING LIKE THE VIBE IS SOOOO SLAYYYYY🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
노래 너무 좋음ㅋ 생각보다 더 좋네요.
It’s giving Kpop gen 3 and I’m lovin’ it
❤❤❤
This is too good 😭😭
so great
I'm so happy to see the girls back
iVe been waiting for this  soooo long 🎉😂❤
Kendall is so fuckin amazing
YOOOOOOOOO 🫠🫠🫠🫠

Espero que saquen lightstick para poder comprarlos y álbumes!!, amo a estas chicas lo tienen TODO.

I have heard this type somewhere maybe some trending song
Wait I have heared this somewhere
YASSS!!!
Me encantoooo, apoyando desde el principio, me encantó sus visuales, coreografías, vocales y masss estoy tan emocionado ya quiero ver q traerán en un futuro!!!
No kpop?
Brava JYP, fai durare le canzoni sempre più brevi. Cerchi di imitare Touch che durava 2:20? La prossima volta falla durare 1:50...
wait where mv ?????
The song was not what I expected, but I'm not complaining, the song is very good.
The Katseye vs Vcha war has restarted 😭😭
日本語のコメントが多くて思わぬサプライズです😮 たっくさん準備してくれたんだね、みんなすごくかっこいいよ！！！！！
Camila 😍
This looks more like performance video than MV.... Jyp is sh*t girls deserve better
This sounds really good
chỉ hai từ thôi “quá bốc” 🤩
wait, where is the official mv??? only choreography ver??
SAVANNA AND KENDALL 🫦🫦
the bridge is wow🤩

the dance so cool!! fighting GIRLSET
NOOO WHY SO SHORT
Where is the MV ?
過去一好き！日本から応援してるよ！
AMAAZIIINNGGG!!!
I don't know what Jyp is thinking, isn't this the best time to drop music video, how many people would want to watch that after this.
Their comeback song only being 2mins long is criminal
İs that a new girl group?
The girls are back and better than ever!! mv did not disappoint!
this song is SOO GOOODDD 🎉🎉
MIDZYS ARE HERE TO SUPPORT
so happy to see their comeback
I didn't even recognise them until I looked in the comments! This is vcha?????
Las amé y amé la canción
You guys know the part that got leaked I swear that's not in the song but I like it anyway
MY GIRLS ARE BACK 🔥 ❤
too short
Нифига какая зажигательная песня, я думала будет что-то слабее, но тоже крутое, а тут я просто в шоке, как круто, мне прям понравилось❤
Achei que ia ter o anúncio do álbum no final do vídeo... 😢 Espero que lancem mais músicas logo, pq quero ver mais de GIRLSET!
NOT BAD BUT NOT GOOD
already flop 😢
VCHA 최애멤버들이 다시 뭉쳤네요ㅠㅠ홧팅!!🥺
Megan trainer trying to be bad gal thats what its giving
I like it very catchy but what kind of name girl set maybe girl code wouldve been catchier
Slay
Ok, well, I do like the song better with the choreo, just like Gnarly, but I still hate the twerking parts and on top of that, they're shaking their chests in your face too? This is why I prefer boy groups, they don't shake their butts at you unless they're being silly or playful and they have no boobs to thrust at you. P.S. I really am anti-girl despite being one. I guess my little sister was right. 😅
😍😍
Excelente debut GIRLSET 🎉🎉
The verses and prechorus go hard
is that savanna?
just a bunch of Adela's, nothing special!
CHOREOGRAPH ATEEEE AND TGE SING US SO GOODDD
IVE WAITED SOOO LONNGGGG !! GIRLSET IS GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL!!
인종별 다양성을 보여야 한다는 강박관념.
The chorus is really good and edgy but the verses and the instrumental gets very light and almost bubblegummy tben the chorus and that best comes in and it gives more gritt and edgy thats my only complaint its like two songs merged together  if you gonna  go bad gal go bad gal jyp !  Jyp can mever just fully commit to edge its like i want to be but i cant the girl groups give very much twice copy and paste i want them to succeed so bad but with this look not comparing but it should have been so gen z pop girl coded  give me some curse words i dont wont the girls sounding like ariana trying to be hip  and i think thats the thing
I love them and i was rooting for them but this song is flopp af..
They've become sooooo thin.....i didnt realise they were VCHA's until its almost over.They all change drastically.😢😢
the budget...
待ってました〜〜〜😂‼️  以前とはまた違う魅力の皆で頑張って欲しいな✨✨✨  応援してます🥰
I love song even so text doesn't make much sense😅
待ってた🥹いろいろ大変な思いをしたと思うけど続けてくれてありがとう🥹成長がすごい❤️‍🔥日本から応援してます🇯🇵❤️‍🔥 I’ve been waiting for this🥹 I’m sure you’ve been through a lot, but thank you for continuing on🥹 Your growth is amazing❤️‍🔥 Sending support from Japan🇯🇵❤️‍🔥
Camila todo que veeer❤❤
so short
Omg this song is so good I need it in Spotify.
Girls so good. Love this❤❤ fire
can we go back to VCHA style?..
Ready to witness their new jouney with them. Let us go GIRLSET❤
Could have had an extra verse and the chorus added to make it a little longer. It's great to see the girls whos priority is to concentrate on making it big as a GROUP rather than solo careers from the very start. Best of luck, girls.
Lexi!!! 🫰🏼
Omg slay❤
Proper subs? No?
🔥🔥🔥
good
Yeah this isnt going to be a hit, i doubt they're going to be more popular than vcha unforunately
Even this is a Choreography Ver. but IM SO OBESSED!!
So happy I belived they’d comeback!
Wth!!! I did not expect thissss
A guria Parece a anitta
Kendalll ateee and left no crumb, clocked it , devoured , etc
what a difference from when they debuted, now they are sexy, they remind me of a certain group...but I hope they do well
Camila's HN❤❤❤❤
They are back at last 😇🙏🏼💪🏼🫶🏼💟
Farofa das boas eu amo ❤
What’s the point of a teaser if you post the choreography first? I can’t with this company
パワフルでめちゃクチャかっこいい！でもガールクラッシュすぎず、上品さやフレッシュさを感じる❤
GIRL YOU ATEEEE
WoW cambiaron tanto 😮 pasaron de niñas inocentes a adolescentes rebeldes jajajja
I was waiting for the MV but it didnt come but it was worth the wait
Jyp is so dumb
❤❤🎉
The fact is : They filmed a mv for this but didn’t release it?  Why?
Слабовато  JYP может лучше🥱
Love the choreography. Girls are so talented
Devoraron mis reinas 🤩
Damn, this song is going to stay in my head all day.
Chorus and the rest of the song sounds like two different songs.. i love the girls but it's unfortunately not a song I'd listen to constantly or listen again
JYP, please, I beg you. Don't let this group die. It has so much potential. It just needs people to give it a chance. The girls have so much to give. Long live girlset. ♥️♥️
OKAAAAAY LEXI WITH THE VOCALS!!!
No mv?
The MV looks very cheap or is it the choreography video??? 😢
개조은뎅
It’s stunning performance 🎉🎉🎉 ❤
Omgggg OUR QUEENS ARE BACK THEY KILLED IT
Love
So cool  Bro  We have to make it go viral ❤❤❤❤
Short?????😢
aku suka lagu comeback girlset commas keren banget dan  wow gelooo girlset commas keren banget 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🫶🫶🫶
WOAAAAHHHH THE GIRLS IS ON FIREEEEEE
I love Camila so much
No mv?
Omg
OMGGGGG
nugu? can someone explain who are they?
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good song but MV Budget $100😂
oh flopset u will never top katseye 😂
Keren
W    O    W   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love this concept for these four <3
Dude what is on with JYP's production and creative team? The song has huge potential for an iconic and explosive mv but they chose a dance performance instead. Isn't this supposed to be a rebrand? But they totally wasted the song's potential.
Are they gonna perform in korean mushow too? Nice song btw only too short😢
Song's pretty generic, a shame since there's real vocals here
No entendí, entonces no va a haber mv??
sorry but what tf
No mv ummm
what is this cheap ass set??? like are u deadass
a lexi teve poucas partes 💔
WE ARE SO BACK
"Welcome back, girls!"  🎉💗🤍
I NEED MV FROM THISS PLEASEE JYP!!🙏🏻😩
실력은 좋은거같다 보컬도 좋고
NOW RELEASE THE MF MUSIC VIDEO WE NEED IT!!!
Me encanta ❤
Kendall voice omg ❤❤
The song is soo good and stronh but,WHY IS SO SHORT?!?!😭
Las amoooo mis niñas
HOY JYP NASAAN YUNG MV?? PASHNEA
If "Mean Girls" In a girlgroup❤
god this is ass
Lucen muy mayores con ese maquillaje excesivo. Merecen mas
ละเพลงจะสั้นอะไรขนาดนั้นนนนนน
Alguien podría explicarme, ¿por qué ahora salen primero los perfomance y choreography version en lugar de los MV's? Antes era totalmente lo opuesto.
Y de verdad no le podían hacer un video musical explosivo porque la canción es buena pero que les costaba a jyp evitarse las críticas con este nuevo lanzamiento.
Wait, no mv?
the song is cool, but is so short... waiting something better in the future
wtf, who are they? i love them!! they way better than katseye. better looking too! WAIT!! they VCHA!! OMFG!! fk ya!!! this is awesome!!! im sooo happy they back. so hot and grown up!!! sexy!!! fk ya!!!
No me gustó, paracen Katseye pero de Temu 😮
I can see why they started them off with a cute concept. It's perfect for their vocals. And that Asian girl is a really good dancer
Porque cortaba la nota alta camila? Jsksks
I love this song sm but I can't get over the fact the bridge isnt even 1:30 into the song 😭😭 serving vocals rap dance and face though
Whoa!😳 That was surprising. In a good way. 💕💕💕💕
I've read a lot of hate including they're katseye 2.0 like can you not?  Can we just support and enjoy their new group and song?   Can't wait for the full MV 😍❤️
they have no MV?
alright.... more mature and i like. although i waited this long for this??!! thought we was going to get a MV ON THEIR CHANNEL?
Obsessed w Kendall’s voice in thisssss ❤🔥🔥🔥
savanna look like annita
This is just an intro song mind yall. To get them back out there. And to me it was amazing. Visuals vocals dance break loved it all. 🥹 so proud of them and can’t wait to see how far they’ll go
Omg
This song will BOP🎉🎉🎉.
Coreografia antes do MV ? ou já é o MV ? Poxa
OH THEY SLAYED
I love the direction they are going for
Super, éxito seguro ❤❤❤
Sorry guys I have no complaints, the truth is that I missed these girls so much and the song is actually fire, the chorus is soo catchy, minimalist and forceful song each one showed their evolution in their part, now I see more confidence in them, they have grown in every way, ready for whatever comes, I see a great future for GIRLSET! <3
Maybe I Stan them 👍🏻👍🏻✨✨✨
❤❤❤❤
Aburrido ver americanos
This song doesn’t suit their voice
This will be a failure, please do not include Americans, ruin the group.
I LOVE THEM SM
MY GIRLSSS
this is actually amazing
The only downside is being THIS short. The rest are great! As a debut song, COMMA is not bad! Not bad at all!! As a matter of fact, I did enjoy it more than VCHA debut song. Congrats GIRLSET for debuting! Those talking about budget, well this used to happen all the time to other jype groups lol..even smaller companies got higher budget than jype for their groups..only recently jype groups are getting a higher budget and quality comeback materials....just wait for GIRLSET's turn!
Wow girls💯☺️
The energy, vocals, vibes, dance, passion <3 love it <3 Let's go Girlset!
the song is alright… they deserve more tbh
Vocal of yellow haired girl is amazing😮
TF LOW BUDGET, THE CAMERAMEN WAS SHAKING.
Espero que esto sea un especie de single predebut ( la canción está buena )
Se ven tan bien siento que me van a encantar más que antes
めちゃくちゃセクシー！！
Need real MV
セクシーでかっこいい😎！
I miss the days when they release EP not single.
Девчонки хороши ❤
THIS ATE DOWWWWNNNJ
Mesmo a música sendo curta e o orçamento ser meio "meh" eu ainda gostei do estilo, as meninas arrasaram em tudo aq
Su canción es asombrosa y hermosa!!! 💯💫
Little mix vibe
Me gusto
What happened to the leaked parttttt it was SOO gooodd
La canción es buena pero esperaba más de JYP 😢
Let’s go girls
The camera angles are terrible 😭 but the choreo and song is good✨ but where is the mv?
Kendall Spears
끝까지 포기하지 않고 꿈을 따라가주길 바라요~~
Esta nueva imagen les queda demasiado bien  Se lucen demasiado y resaltan
The song is so beautiful and it has everything a bridge, a dance break, 3 verses, 3 chorus so how is it that it's 2 minutes long?!
It's sooo good 🔥🔥🔥
Kendall voice is EVERYTHING
i loveeeeeeee
Mm suena muy bieeen
Love it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OBSESSED!! 😍🔥
Girlseeeet❤❤❤❤
They're vocals improved so much
You have nailed it girls ❤❤❤
bruh, comments are crazy .. stop comparing them to otehr group lol those two are very different and girlcrush concept is very common thing in this indutry .. sigh
Vcha is back!!🎉
❤❤❤❤❤
Nooo JYP que hiciste, lo tenías todo  para el rebut, short song y porque solo la coreografía y el vídeo?
MIDZY here to support GIRLSET
What was This Camila vocals, im in love
we need vcha jyp you did a dirty things we need KG and Kaylee too
AYEEEEE
I really wanted them to completely step out of the kpop sound and make music like flo
its... not
As long as they happy bro
Jyp where is the mv ? Girls deserve better promotion .
what???? only 2 minutes 😢😢😢
It was a really long time for this song
i really am hoping for the best for these girls
okay but can we talk about lexi and savanna’s vocal improvement in such a short amount of time??? they killed this.
SAVVANA IS BIAS
これだよJYP
I have a feeling that this is not the full song yet, this is just a preview let’s all wait for the MV, So far this is catchy song!
Girlset red concept
Im so proud of my girls, they've came so far. Good luck girlset!
WHY'S THE SONG BARELY 2 MINUTES
isso é uma música ou interlude mds...
why is the choreography video first instead of a music video? 😭   i mean, still thank you.
HEY! we got a bridge, im content.
メイクとか雰囲気がメンバーに合ってて魅力的すぎる ダンスもめっちゃ頑張ったんだろうな 切実に売れて欲しい、、、
Ué cadê o MV?
Ahhhh, finally!!! This song arrives like a breath of fresh air! It's confident, unapologetic, and simply radiant. It feels like the perfect anthem for anyone ready to take a pause, gather their strength, and rewrite their story on their own terms. Truly empowering! I love it!!! ❤
感覺公司沒有用心投入這組團體有點可惜😢
1:33 ❤
This Is For, Commas, come on JYP, who the heck is running things over there. make these songs longer
COMMAS❤❤❤
Happy debut!!! I wish nothing but success!! :D 💓
Primera, hicieron que savanna bajara de peso, espero y no la este pasando mal, y que haya hecho el cambio de manera saludable, segunda, sus vocales mejoraron mas del 50% diooooooosss... tercera ¿es idea mia o ese look en el cabello y esas miradas soberbias la hacen parecerse a la diosa brasileña Anitta?
I hate JYPE. It didn't give them a good promotion, they definitely deserve something much better, the song is not bad but it's not good either ig that it wasn't such a planned comeback
Mantap!!!
Love the song, let's enjoy people. They are coming back and just to read complaints... how tiring
Girlset let's go!
LEXI ATEEE
The venue doesn't support their performance. 😢 I hope they choose a better place for their choreography performance.
When will the full MV be released?
its crazy that vcha went from a cutey concept to a girl crush one😭 we will miss kc and kaylee ❤ i hope jyp do this good and don't mess them up again AND GIVE THEM LONGER SONGS PLEASE😭
Girls set fighting❤
으잉 너무 캣츠아이같다 이그룹도 예쁘구 멋지고 잘하지만..
I'm so sorry but this choreo is too good. I need to learn it
The song exceeded my expectations but it’s a little underwhelming for a group that definitely has alot to prove with their redebut
They're doing great 💪👏👏🎶👑
Bro they not harmonizing good at more I'm sorry but there team is to blame they did not mix it well 😭😭
Omg
WE'RE SO BACKKKK
THIS SONG IS SOOO GOOD!!! I HOPE WE GET MUSIC SHOW PERFORMANCES😩
Nice ❤
Slayyyy❤
Boring !!!!!!
Kendall 🔥
Omg
THEY ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS
That was so good!! I think this concept fits them better :D also they all look so pretty!
❤❤❤
They deserve a high quality MV.. what the hell JYP
Wow i love their voice also i love these choreography
😭😭😭😭 Lexi's voice is so good! She improved so much - thar run and high note! Just wish she had more lines!!!!
They look so much more mature now (ofc it's been a year lol) but it's good to see the new side
I love Camila’s pout at 1:39, it’s giving “I’m that girl” and ATTITUDEEEEEE period!
years of hiatus and this is what they do? fuck global groups bro theyre so lazy
와! 이렇게 좋다구? 너무 감명 받았다! 정말로 오래 기다린 보람이 있다! May GirlSet be loved and praised forever!!!
❤
Lexie always servingg
WHO IS YOUR BIAS IN GIRLSET
After so much time and so many obstacles, I’m so happy we’re finally seeing our girls shine! Congrats on your comeback girlset!
No mv????
OKAYYY THIS IS CUTE BUT WE NEED MORE
めっちゃいいやないか
i don't get why JPY don't do Official MV, only one was a better music video than this, and than girl of the year which were official BIG release debut, re-debut... this is make them look cheap...a good job as a label its release a good music video, concept, locations, etc...this is cute but looks cheap, and its JYP fault. yeah its the choreography ver, but they will release the non choreography ver?? like...
GENTE A GAROTA PARECE A ANITTA SOCORRO
Doesn’t feel right without kaylee and kg
i mean it shows 12am August 29th timer on the girls account? so maybe in about 2hours official mv should be out?
Congrats girls!!
This is the music I expected from them. 🎉🎉🎉
Esperé más. Creo que es demasiado corto, por qué? Creo que JYP ni se esforzó por aunque sea darles una buena canción. Creo que saco este comeback de donde sea, para disipar la denuncia... en fin
I expected nothing less from my girls.This is just what we were all waiting for
this is so good, LOVEEE!! and if U are reading this, PLEASE DONT MIND THE HATE y'all received, I LOVEEE THIS SONG

왜이렇게 짧어?
Slay
Wheres the actual music video?😅
The vocals OMGG
Quienes son? Es nuevo grupo?
This is like knockoff katseye
THEYYY ATTEEEE ❤🎉🎉🎉 CONGRATS GIRLS WE MISSED YOUU 🥹🥹
Why post choreography before MV, Its annoying now, that and showing the whole chorus dance before release just spoilt it . It's a shame cuz the song is good, delivery not so much😢
The ending was so addictive 😊❤
The lyrics: Spend some money on me.   JYP: Giving them a 1 dollar MV.   😂 Like wtf??
Y'all made us wait 2 weeks for a tiktok video
GIRLSET💋
원래 이런 조합은 이질감이 살짝 느껴지는게 통상적인데 전혀 이질감이 들지 않는다 그래서 엄지 척👍근데 잘하네😁👍
Stills sound like kpop
Does it have an mv guyss??
AMO AMO AMO AMO AMO
놀라움의 연속. 어떤속에서 이런 예술이 생겨나는걸까~ 와~ !!!
welcome to new era gurls

みんなかっこいい！！ 日本から応援してます❤
it's alr but for a rebrand it's not thay good. It looks cheap tho which is the sad part but I'll wait for the mv. The girls are absolutely gorggggg!!!!
Esto debió a ver  hecho desde el principio  la jyp está muy bueno la verdad Pero hubiera estado mejor sacar el mv para que dieran el boom
켄달, 카밀라, 사바나, 렉시가 너무도 잘하네. 노래도 잘하고, 춤도 잘추고...! GIRLSET FIGHTING ! ❤❤
Esta buenísima 🎉
Camila high note is not a joke❤😮

Could have been a proper MV but not a choreography ver. after all this hype…
Bellas mis niñas ❤❤❤ las amooooo

おかえり! みんな更にキレイになってる❤ 応援してるよ! 身体に気をつけてね
They are all ladies now

Vcha or Girlset
their height is kinda odd looking
좋은 곡을 만들고도 왜 이렇게 짧아?? 앨범이 곧 나온 다는 뜻이라고 생각하께~!

This concept suits them much better! The vocals are great too!
👍
I hope they perform at mnet music show
The song is not bad, but you can see the void left by Kayle and KG.
Too short? Listen TWICE!
La industria: Ellas juran 🙄💅
i am not feeling this song
MY GIRLS
Wait damnnn sooo good
The MV will be released at 12 AM local time (Los Angeles). Guys
1:40 this part reminded me of whiplash by aespa
We have no choice but to support them so that they can perform at Coachella!! It's just the bestーー❤

Wait who are they? Someone tell me pls
Loved it
Las amo
Great girls 🔥

So budget?
❤❤
WOW
Definitivamente nunca nos van a decepcionar, apoyando a las chicas desde A2K! 💪
GIRLSET!!! My beautiful and blessed talented girls!!! Welcome back my girls!!! 🌹💖💎
The camerawork is not good at all. It's shaking and just focusing on their faces, not the choreography, Very very dussapointed JYP!!!!!!
slay
VAMOOOS GIRLSET🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
언제나 응원해요
They finally came back.
Savanna looks so much like Anitta in this ❤
제왑노래는 국내나 해외나 듣거다...정신좀차려라
02:02 for such a good song!? this is diabolical JYPE
And the fact they are all introverts is CRAZY captivating🤭
Where is the MV JYP
Jyp for the next one spend some money on them please
Hello? How much has Savannah's voice improved?
Mv
girls so slayyy🔥🔥🔥
Is it possible to have just one girl group that isn't dressed/dancing like strippers? If the music is good, they don't need to show their bodies to gain a following🤢
1:49 OMG ATEEE😭💗
Katseye got their competition in Girlset.
OOHHH YES WE ARE SO BACKKKKKK THESE DIVAS CAME BACK EVEN BETTER
FINALLY THE GIRLS ARE BACK 🎉
Where's the main Music Video???
So this is the reason why the teaser is only 7 sec, I get it😅😅😅😅
OMG, the girls shine so much🥹💖 I've been really waiting for this, which is now like a dream...
Too short hayst
This song is so gooddddd
YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ME LOOKING AT KEEP LOOKING AT ME LIKE YOU WANNA SPEND SOME MONEY ON ME MONEY ON ME IM LIKE COMMAS😝😝😝
Vocal Dancing performance amazing ❤❤❤
I hope someone spends money for a better stylist. 😂. The styling doesn’t really fit the theme of “I can get it on my own.”   I really like the song. Wish it wasn’t so short. It’s catchy.
I really want the mv first and second choreography,😢
A2k Vcha Girlset ❤❤
Es muy buena canción aunque sea corta ❤ Por sierto Camila esta super bonitaaaa
Mis chicas están de vuelta!!!💖💖
I L O V E this songg!!!❤❤❤

THIS IS FIREEEEEEE
4人とも素敵！！もう少しお金をかけて撮影してほしかった😂
OMG girlset this song is super good ❤
Amazing ❤❤
Miss you
Mucha promoción en el coro para tener solo un video coreografico, que ojo, la coreografia me parece genial y las chicas se ven increíble, pero tambien es solo un escenario en todo el vídeo y la cancion es corta. Espero realemente vengan más cosas mejores hechas, con mejores promociones y más presupuesto para ellas en el futuro, hagamos que a esta canción le vaya bien por lo pronto, la seguiré escuchando ♡
Love you
Ameee chicas las amoooooo divinoooo❤
OMG LOVE IT SO MCUH
Y EL MV???
Okay wow, despite how short this is is somehow feels pretty complete!! The song is a banger, and the video is amazing!! The rebrand really works for them, and I am excited to see what they continue to do as four!! I love you Girlset, Fighting!! ☺️💕🤗💞
Girlset go go
SOTY ❤
SING IT, GIRLS!!!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Glad to see our girls back ❤️
Ooooo!!!
The song is so good!❤ yay happy debut as Girlset day!
Mexicooo present
oh they’re not here to play
😮🎉❤ 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
FAN SINCE A2K, LOVE U GIRLLSSS
Comassdd
Why the studio is soo crammed, choreo looks awkward from this close ,they should have booked a bigger studio and shot some wide angled shots to highlight the formation and hand gestures more appropriately, jype team either gets a low salary or they are just not competent enough,look at the budgets of these new kpop groups by other companies, Girls did good tho
Lexie❤
They should should not have shooted the music video from this close that only their faces are visible this much close to their face it would have been better if they hard shoot the song from a little far away because the choreography the main steps are really nice they would have been look better if the shooting was done from a little far away
GIRLS!! SLAYED! ♡ LAS AMOO, Se ven hermosaaaas, estoy tan feliz por este regreso
I have been waiting for a long time! I am cheering for you from Japan!  待ってました！！ 日本から応援しています🫶🫶
Nos dieron   VOCAL VISUAL DANCE Y Comeback✨
good song
How can i promote these girls if this video is bad.. it will only set them up
soty
GIRLSET 4EVER🥹🥹🥹
Savannaaaa!
Finally 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
I LOVE THEIR SINGING
56 MINSS
gag
WOOOOOOWWWWWW, AMAZING GURLSSSSSS
I am so proud of them
ATE
the music is good , I love it a lot
Savanna is becoming the vocal Queen we envisioned ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 LOVE U GURLS
THIS ATE DOWN!!!!
Brightly shining AS ALWAYS.
Wow pefecet
Omgg, chicas esto es tan increíblee que estoy demasiado sorprendida, las admiro chicas, son increíbles 🥺💕
Dance break wtf cool
That na na na na na na na na twice song they got 😅
Only 2 minutes?!
❤
The vocals, The visuals, The dance break - everything is perfect!!!!
WHY THE HECK IS THIS SO SHORTTTTT I WANT MORE, GIRLS.
Omg they Ate
Wowow me encanta este nuevo concepto :) hy q apoyarlas con todo 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
So catchy omgg😭🩷love their concept STAN GIRLSET
Imagine JYP meant to post the official music video but posted the choreography version instead
박진영씨 제작비 너무 아낀거 아닙니까?
1:35
Increíble, un poco malo pero me encantó
Omggg❤
Savanna…the Jihyo of GirlSet. Or the Ryujin of GirlSet?  Lexi…ALL the expression straight through the body. She is dance in human form.  Kendall…the Mina of the group?   Camilla…spicy af, and solid through and through.
Pas awal denger juga langsung suka, semoga mereka banyak lebih dikenal fighting
So good
they are so talented this song should be trend
Good starting  Good voice  Good group  Good dance.  Good vibe. ❤❤❤
Not bad
Choreography only? Two minutes & two seconds?  Are you intentionally trying to make these girls fail? Because it sure looks like it to me.
Does this feel like it’s several songs stitched together? I like them. But this song doesn’t feel cohesive.
Amooooooo 😉😉😉😉
I like it.
ケンダルの声かわいい！！
I thought it will be a M/V😢
oh they change group name? i ddnt know..
1:48 the best part
It honestly sounds hella short.. it’s nice but short.
잇지한테 좋은 노래나 줘라 Kpop에 한국인없이 하냐 ㅋㅋ캣츠아이보고 배워라
Queens!
Camila Vocals omg ❤
Jype is actively sabotaging their artists by making their songs WAY too short.
A2Kのあの子たちがこんなパーフェクトガールに！！
It’s out on my birthday omgggggggg❤❤❤
Kg and kaylee 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
hope the best for them
1:09 this is the first global girl group slays ❤❤❤❤
I loved it
오 좋은데 ~
Hola si, perdí la cuenta de cuantas veces lo vi ya, son increíbles.
I loved it the coreo the song and their looks
Crushed it! I’m excited to this debut, wishing you girls the best
pq subieron la versión de la coreografía primero que el mv? estan saboteando el re debut de las chicas :/ o es que no tienen presupuesto para ellas
Firstly, the girls look good and I know that they are talented. But this ain't it though. It's underwhelming, specially after all that excitement about them finally getting to debut. This sounds like a generic kpop song. Also, I know it's just the choreography video but it looks like a high schooler filmed it in the dressing room. JYP needs to do better.
gì có 2p zị trời
Girlset is gonna do better than prelude or whatever that katseye reject group is called 😂
The vocals??? The rap?? The dance ?? The visuals??? ATEE
They are talented!  👍.  Song is catchy 👏
Rolaaaaa
😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The song is so good but  too short :(  Girlset is amazing ♡
This is so slay!! Camila voicd sounds so good
its so good!!!! love ya girlset ❤️
'-' mi honesta reacción
Where is the mv?
SAVANNA OMG BIAS SLAYED
How dare JYPE not spend money on these baddies
Only 2 min? Too short
i like them as a group n individually but i don't necessarily like it, its js not clicking for me yet. not hating on them, js stating my opinion.
The choreography mv is way too cheap to come off from a big company come on jype spend some money on them money on them money on them
no posno
OKAY KENDALL👏 IMPROVEMENT
They deserve so much better they don't even have special camera angle shots just one set
i wish the song was longer , so glad they're back !!!
Y es qué  no tienen presupuesto para un MV ???
Savanna se ve omg😍
MY BABIES ARE BACK!!!! STOP WHY I GET SHIVERS
Can’t stop replaying this, the debut is perfection!!!!
en esto se gastan el dinero de mis albumes increible
大掛かりなセットやCGが無くてもこの4人とそのスキルさえいれば、どこでもステージだし、ゴージャスだ！
I truly don’t understand why JYP refuses to put more budget into them. If the artists work hard, then the company should do the same. It always feels like they deliver low quality when it comes to this group. 진짜 이해 안 돼. 왜 JYP는 이 그룹에 돈을 안 쓰는 거야? 멤버들은 그렇게 열심히 하는데 회사는 왜 안 맞춰주는 건데. 맨날 이 그룹만 퀄리티 낮게 나오는 느낌임.
Ellas regresaron con todooooo🫶🏻
LEXIIIIIIIIIIII YES KEEP THE HAIR I LOVE THIS
Wait so what happened to the girl that is suing jyp are we gonna ignore her claims
Guy's don't worry mv is coming out soon today!! ( Iam so exited for this song to played in my playlist) Such a banger🔥🎀
100k in this hour
Ooo okay yall ate that
GUYS.......THIS IS SO FREAKING GOOD !!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Money
Hello Girlset welcome back 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
노래 중독성 있어요~ 보컬도 너무 좋구요~ 걸셋 화이팅❤
OMG I LOVE THIIS OMG
Is this MV??
개좋네 잘 어울리는 옷을 찾은듯
돈지랄  하고  있네 있는  있지나  엔익스한테나  잘하쟈
Amooooooo 🇦🇷🇦🇷
Wheres the MV
katseye copy
I love how in Only One, the line is "You're the only one who's got my full permission" but for Commas, the line is "I don't need your permission to get it" 🤭
they are sooo cunty ommmmg but ya too short! "I need moreeee~~~~"
Aren’t “Only One” is Performance video too?… where is the M/V…
Just 2 min jyp?
OMG MY GIRLS IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️
I want an official video!!'
They sounded amazing ^^ , can’t wait for the video tomorrow! Also the lineup here reminds me of my favorite childhood dolls 🥹the Bratz, is like I’m seen them alive
FOR GOD, THIS IS A BANGER.
Hahahaha this is more flop than VCHA
That Voice So GOLD
this ATE
どこの国の女達やろな!?
Why do we keep doing these sub 3 min songs? It just doesnt feel long enough. Other than that I enjoyed it.. But yeah a song ending at 2 minutes is not it!
ガンバ〜っ❤…ってるか、もう😂 応援してます。
ATE IT UPPPP
おかえり！ また会えて嬉しいよ。 体を壊さないようにね。 日本から応援しています😊
YEAAAAAA SAVVVV
Lagunya sudah ke spill banyak dari awal di konten2 mereka. Baru pas hari H keluar, ternyata pendek aja lagunya. Terus mana MVnya? Sebenarnya niat rebranding gak sih? Karena ini kurang banget loh kalo mau dibilang😢
2 minutes?!!! we need more??!!!
ちょっと昔のITZY感ある歌
No MV!???
I love you baby ❣️❣️
Is this the official music video already?
OMG QUEENS❤
Love itttt. I love u girls but Camila is on fire 🔥❤!!!!
This is such a good song!
I didn't expect it to be so short, but I truly enjoyed how each section each member was singing. They exaggerated different vocals that you can clearly hear their texture in their voice
The song so short and i was barley getting into the vibe😢 but its good though, not going to lie
OMG!!! THEY literally SLAYEDDDD🤍🖤🤌. Perfect synchronized Dance Moves 🔥
i spent a good ten minutes going back and forth from girlset yt channel, jype yt channel, then girlset facebook page to find the actual mv. is it just this one😭 i haven’t watched it yet. i don’t wanna be spoiled abt the song yet in case it’s not the mv yet.
Vocals🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What’s with the camara work?
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEESSSSS the concept I needed from these talented, beautiful girls!!!!!!!!!
박진영 클라스 어디 안가죠. 돌고돌아 클래식이 최고당
Ku kirain MV ternyata cheography video 😒😒😒
한국에서 먹히기는 힘들거 같은데.. 애초에 해외시장만 보고 만든 그룹인가? 걸그룹 국내시장 버리나요 ㅠㅠ JYP?
노래 너무 좋다
Girlset on fire 🔥
So cool 🤩🔥🔥🔥
WOO!! What a powerful debut (I wish the song was longer though). I'm glad these girls are finally getting the chance to perform and show the world what they've got!
ずっと待ってたよ！！！！！！！！
La empresa teniendo dinero y para nada les dio escenografías ,vestuario  parece un simple short
quede shock
CAMILAAAA
외국인버전 미스에이 아닌가...
Loveeeee thisssssss
perioddddd
GIRLSET!! So excited to see more from you girls! ❤❤
Vocals 🔥 Visual✨ Dance 💃 Everything✅
❤❤❤❤❤
The song is good but short 🥲 Also can the cameraman back up next time😅 I’m trying to see the dancing but the camera was zoomed on their faces
The mv and teaser being the shortest thing jyp ever put out-
While I'm playing, commas will get them to 1 million
So cvnty!!!
this is mv???? Stranger!
all i hear is bangers
Best of luck for these girlies right here 🎉🎉 all have great vocal improvements ❤❤❤

I missed my ladies! I prefer curly hair Savanna. In general, I prefer natural hair, though.
Lexus 💗💗💗
お帰りなさい‼️帰ってきてくれてありがとう😆💕✨
It’s so low budget 🥲
Imagine Katseye and Girlset collabing for this song 😍
YALL ARE SO DAMN PRETTY😭😭😭
GIRLSET SLAYED 🔥 Catchy song, perfect choreo, glowing members… literally everything on point 😍 #GIRLSET
THE CHOREO AHHHH
Increíble
Wow this is so good!!
LETS GO GIRLSSSS
indeed they’re baccckkkkk!!!🙌🏻🥹🫶🏼
where are the other girls?!!?!?!?
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Even from the beginning they can not have proper MV, like an actual music video, it's always choreography version, wth???
AHHHH LAS AMO MUCHOOO❤❤❤
Nice❤
Nope, hate it.  Not a fan of this direction.  GL girls.  I still want them to succeed.
女性グループでこんなに力強いダンスは見たことないと、だいぶ前にNiziUのNINAが言ってました❤
this is so good but what's with jype giving their ggs 2 min songs but still, it's bop
Las mejores , espero estén bien después de pasar por mucho , coman bien chicas 😢❤❤ se que tendrán mucho éxito
ohhh in fairness, this is addictinggg!
PLEASE BE FAMOUS FOR US
Global queens in the making, congrats on your debut!!!!
코디좀 신경쓰자 노래는 좋은데
after this will they be gone for a year?
I like it 👍🏼
よく頑張った！！！きっと色々考えることもあったと思います。応援しています。
there volcas are so goodddd!
楽曲は短いのに満足感がギュッと凝縮されていて、最高じゃないか！この最高の料理に携わった全ての人を呼んでくれないか？感謝を伝えたくて仕方ないよ
0:55 she loves im nayeon
Get it baes
Está canción está muy buena y pegajosa, lastima que solo dura 2 minutos 😢, espero que les vaya muy bien a estas chicas porque la verdad le veo mucho potencial a este grupo, y también espero que JYP lanze un MV de esto, osea coreografí versión y no tuvo pero nisiquiera un cambio de escenario, y eso que JYP tiene dinero y es una de las 4 empresas élites de kpop 😔🖐🏻
Girlset is about to come on strong.
Decir que me encantó es poco! Es una canción muy divertida y pegadiza 🤩 estaré viendo y escuchando esto por mucho tiempo 🎉❤  Felicidades pequeñas, valió toda la pena del mundo esperarlas ❤❤❤❤
IM SO IN LOVE WITH GIRLSET MUAHHH
This song is so good I'll stan them
Te amo Lexi
Si me gustó ❤❤
Just TWO minutes???!! What's happening whit music nowadays 😢 its Sad at this point
GIRLSET WILL FOREVER BE FAMOUS🙏💗
ずっと待ってたよー！！！ これからがとっても楽しみ！！！ 日本にもファンがいるからね！いつか会えますように！！！！！
PERFECT
❤
I LOVE YOUUUU
Flops
I'll be supporting GIRLSET, and you?
Now we need the mv ⁉️💞
Amazing! But why does it feel a bit empty?
❤ ame la canción 😻
felicutaciobnes
YESSS GIRLSETTTT
얘넨 누구여
its good just hope they get longer songs in the future
WHOS BEEN HERE SINCE A2K??
As of now, I'm not sure if I like it or not, but I'll give it another chance or two and see. The song reminds me of Itzy mixed with Ariana Grande so it's taking me a moment to really process it 😅
How many of them left the group??
MY GIRLS NEVER DISAPOINT
SLAYYYY
They deserve a 3minute song
Dancebreak was everything ❤❤❤❤
Personally didn't care for the after-school-special vibe that VCHA was bringin' Commas bangs hard, instantly on repeat 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok I actually really like this! Looking forward to seeing more from them
❤❤
¡Me encanta! Es muy adictiva al igual que la coreografía. De verdad tenemos que apoyar a Girlset. México las apoya.  Fighting🍀
Okaay Vcha chill, tf did I do to you?! Switching up like tf??!😳
ATEEEEE❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
❤❤❤
OMG ES INCREIBLE T - T !!!!!!!!!
Yall herd them “spend some money on me” so they can release a longer song next time! ❤❤❤😂😂😂
4人のダンスと歌がもっと沢山の人達に届きます様に❤大好き❤
It wasn't supposed to be the MV first
Oh jyp you will rot in hell
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Con todo respeto , pero ya se está perdiendo el verdadero concepto deo K-pop
みんなキレイ！ステキ！ 応援してます！
VAMOS GIRLSETT ❤🎉🎉
They sung this live and did really well I was really shocked with Lexi, savanna and Kendall’s voice they gotten a lot better💕!
SAVANNA I LOVE YOU !!!💗💗💗💗
i miss my girls
Love the song but dumm thats a small room for them to dance jyp?!!
This song is ass
WE WANT LONGER SONGS PLS
Y el mv?😢
SAVANNA LOOOKS LIKE ANITTA SOOOO MUCH. ❤
JYP WE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM, WHY THE SONG SO SHORT?! 😭
Me siento robada, jyp no me digas que solo vas a sacar esto? Y el vídeo cuando menos? UnU
omg i love kendall she is so pretty
Everyone is satisfied by this song seriously? Only 2 min, they redebut with a performance video not even an MV that is the most important at debut??? There's only a pre chorus and a chorus? Tiktok fried your brain or what? Satisfied with just 1min of good thing? It's not a song, it just a demo at this point, you deserve better girlset I was so hyped by the short, but now i realize i was listening to the full song since 1 month.... Im not an hater, but being satisfied with that and Nmixx got hate at their debut with 1000x quality than that it's Crazy  I know maybe you want to support the girl but let's be real, if you say your satisfied with that, they will never get far  you'll only get 2mins single dong  at every comeback ....
So the haters who come here and say this  look katseye are your eyes blind or do katseye release choreography version first do they release cheap looking videos so you’re the ones let us think that katseye is a cheap group while you compare this to katseye.even I’m disappointed as jype fan of this video
is this 4th impact now?
So after a lawsuit, horrible accusations, losing two members, over a year-long hiatus, a rebrand, and non-stop teasing of new music, we get a two-minute song that is mostly just repeating the chorus again and again. Yeah, JYP this is ridiculous! How can we support this group when there is barely anything to support?
GIRLSET really deserves to be in Coachella 2026
I remember A2K and alll these 4 were always such strong dancers it’s crazy finally seeing it on display
10/10
Sheesh this is so good
The song and choreo are sooo good 😭🔥 but why is the full version just 2 minutes?? I need moreeee!!
Omg this song serve Im gonna listen to it everyday
I loveeeeeeee girlset slaaaaay always
A 2 minute song is crazy short. 2 minutes and 30 minutes is already short but just 2???
THE VOCALS???? THE RUNS????
おかえりー！これからも応援してるよー！がんばれー！
YEEEEES ❤❤❤
This is fire
OKAYYYY WE SEE YOU GIRLSET!!!
no MV?
The autotune in their voice us ear bleeding
Wow this is so good!!!
VCHA sounded unique. GIRLSET sounds like the name you give a placeholder group in a PowerPoint.
待ってたよー！！
Why jyp has too many groups while their songs are all bad Except for Twice and Skz
OMG I didn't recognize them at all!!  The sexy concept fits them so well!!
Not supporting you guys sorry did a lot worse to kg and Kaylee
This song is too good
Omg ame
Sav and Kendall’s energy ❤
me encantoo, pero porque tan cortoooo, y no tendra mv??
ES TAN BUENO. ❤
THE VOCALS ARE SO GOOD
GIRLSET is to start!! Applause to all the members who are working hard every day! I'm rooting for you from Japan!🇯🇵 あいしてるよー❤️‍🔥
The QUEENS returned!!!😍💖
おかえりなさい！！ かっこいいー
This is soooooooo goooood
かっこいい！！
OKAYYY!!!! If this is JUST the choreography version, then the actual MV is going to be insane! They all look so good, esp. Camila who is serving a full course meal!!! My only complaint is that it's way too short.  Wishing all the girls (including the ex members) all the best, esp. after what they've all been through!!
DEBUT ATE ATE ATE 🔥
Girls on 🔥🔥🔥🔥💓
So now we are telling girls again that their goal should be to attract men for financial success and calling that independence? I guess that's a kinda 180° feminism
Me gusta demasiado la música pero creo que lo adelantaron demasiado promocionando así que no da la buena impresión de otras promociones , me encantan ❤
I love this song
These girls ate✨✨✨✨✨
🎉🎉宝宝们记住中国也有粉丝支持你们~~！
Alguien vio esta maravilla en vivo?
BROO THATS TOO SHORT
LETS GO!!!!
OMGGG BUENÍSIMAAA
Im hereee, i lov this
also it should be illegal for a song to be this short 😭 i was just getting startedddd
뮤비는 없나요?
where's the goddamn mv jype??!!! song is so good though, and the choreo *chef kisses*
❤❤❤
Me encanta ❤
Las amo chicas <3
love uuu girlsettt❤❤❤
Not for me but good luck! Wishing the best for you regardless of it not being my taste. I know you guys have went through a lot. I hope the road forward is better than the road behind you.
only 2 minutes and 2 seconds? c'mon jyp u know u can do better
This is so good!!!
Oh this album is about to eat!🔥
Yes!!! Let's go my girls
I really need this song to be longer. Aside from that, the ladies DELIVERED. GIRLSET YES PLEASE!
GIRLSET on MNET/Inkigayo?
Volvieron las reinas!!!😍💖
Me encantan chicaaaas❤
Me encantaaa. Está buenísima la canción 💗 las amo Girlset. <3
THEY LOOKED SUPER PRETTY. WHOEVER CRITICISES THEM ARE FOOLS 😜
No mames JYP una canción que a duras penas pasa los 2 minutos 😒 desde ahí se nota que no cambió nada..... todo mal con la JYP 😒😒
the vocals are shining on this song!!!
No MV, canción corta, su subdivisión se gasto el presupuesto en la demanda con kg 😂
even the live performance looks better than this jype stand up. so much potential but very obvious there’s basically no budget. quit wasting these girls time
THIS ATE!!!❤️❤️
The vocal Is good 😭
This is not a mv
Yeah girls
カッコいいーーーー😂😂😂
As somebody who isn't a  fan this song is awsome
Omg 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 is diferrents and cooL👍
Jyp where is the MV
it is a good song
THIS IS SO GOOD❤❤❤❤
실력  많이 늘었네❤❤❤
JYP!!! un version coreografica??' donde esta el MV??' es enserio??' encima le pusieron un dolar en la grabación, no se que pensar la verdad, las chicas ya pasaron por tanto y sale esto asi nada más, vengo del live stream y tambien un desastre. Todo mi amor para las chicas a quienes sigo desde el programa de supervivencia, no sé que este pasando a la interna pero porfavor no dejemos de apoyar y velar por GIRLSET
I am addicted to Chorus!!
한국 음방 나올려나 ?
So good ❤
Ok, y’all ate
I need a proper reason why a good song like this keeps getting shorter and shorter? 2 minutes and 2 seconds cannot give me enough satisfaction???
Slayed hard!!
Panjangin dikitlah lagunya jyp🙇‍♀️ masih pen dengerin dah abis lagunya☺
La coreografía es perfecta, espero ver más de ellas y sobre todo algo en español vamos girlset!!!❤🎉
sick beat on this song
From being a pure innocent girl group to being a baddie wow ❤
Estuve esperando esto mucho tiempo 😭🔥🔥🔥
This song is a masterpiece. Been counting down for the release Aug 29th. Love their vocals,rap and I wish them all the best ❤😊
아이 신난다
Another generic song about an "empowered" woman with an inflated ego who constantly tells herself she deserves more... great job...
this remind me itzy 1 year
This is amazing!!!!!!
OMG SAVANNA?!?? YOUR HAIR?!?? OMG SO PWEETYYYYY🥹🫶🏼
Hope we get an mv too. ❤
サムネで、1番右の赤いスカートの人、アリアナみたいな歌声ですげぇ、、、！！！みんなかっこいい！！すき！
I AM EARLY AND THIS IS A SLAY
DESDE SU PRE-DEBUT ❤❤❤
I kike thiss
I love girls set
CAMILA ES INSANE!!!!!!! La pieza clave del grupo❤
We are getting another MV right? Cause this is just Choreography Ver.
Nooo bro I don’t like this
THIS ATE UP SO HARD!!!!! 😱
かっこいい〜！！おかえり！
Yalls ate! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love girls set so cute 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Feels like a pre-release for pre debut song than an actual title track debut song? Too short ,and budget ain't there. More like an introduction perhaps?
YASSS! 🔥🔥🔥
Happy Debut Queens!!!!
Go gurls 🎉
Not even an outro at the end??😭
where's the M/V???? This is the first time a group that is debuting release Choreography version first.
OMG estoy maravillado!!! Me encanta todo, coreografía, outfits, vocales, siempre las apoyaré chicas ❤
1M GOALLLLLLL 🎉🎉🎉
En español, Camila, Savanna, Lexi y Kendall, hicieron un gran trabajo, las amo
is this their official music video? if so the budget sucks. if not then where si the official music video and why is this choreo video uploaded before the music video
Lexi!? 0:53 😮was that her frrrrrr daaaaaamn
Debutas a tu nuevo grupo con un video coreográfico Jype?😤
목소리가 넘나 듣기좋다.❤
Stream COMMAS
i dont get it, so this song doesn’t have a music video?? why is the choreo ver is released first???
im so proud of the girls this choreo is so fun
❤❤❤❤
My gaaad 💯💯🔥Savana  girls Slay
Cool fong thank you GIRLSET
I’m obsessed with the little arm pump during the “gonna put me first” it’s so satisfying
I LOVE IT!!!
yassss 💗💗💗
Streammm
I forgot how addicting their voices are
sigh 2 minutes? please stop this
WHAT!!! This is amazing 😭
No more 2min songs plz JYP at least 3mins
Extrañaba tanto a mis chicas ☹️💗
can't wait for the mv!
1. WHO ARE THESE DIVAS 2. THEY DEFINITELY DESERVE BETTER i need to see more from them 😭💗
This is the first JYP group that ZERO korean member.
honestly i wish they just released the MV. i find the choreography video should've been a later thing. i like the song but the production seems so low effort tbh :/ especially bc this is their debut song i feel like the teasers lasted too long and shouldve been released sooner tbh. they sound and look amazing but this is not jyp's best work.
ATE QUEENS
quieren ser Katseye
AMAZING
JYP deja las canciones cortas xfa 💔
I love this song, it's very addictive 🫶😭🫦💖
THIS IS KINDA A BANGER NGLLLLL...
I love it but hate how short it is
Let’s gooo girls ❤️✨❤️✨❤️
I thought we gonna see the Mv 1st? 😢😢😢BUT ITS OKEY GO GUUURLS❤ FIGHTING
Savanna should have kept her natural Curly hair. The straight hair looks good but having her curly big puffy hair is more captivating and beautiful.
OMG MY GRLS 🥹
CAMILA VOCALS HELLO.
What's her name she sounds like Ariana here 1:39
Yes gurls, give me nothing… 🫩
노래는 진짜 너무 좋은데 뮤비가 없나 왜 코레오영상이 먼저 올라온건지..
I was a bit scared but they delivered ❤ I’m genuinely surprised 😊
Ok choreography??? Not m/v??? Ok 2 minutes???? Jyp give them normal rebranding..
soy  yo  o tien un parecido con gnarly jump y this is four?
Kendall I love you
Es muy repetitiva 😭 pero espero que les vaya súper bien a las chicas, espero y si puedan triunfar como es su sueño 💗
So they do not have the mv mean this is not the redebut song or what??
I LOVED IT ❤❤❤❤
OMGGGGG SOUURRR GOODDDD MY GIRLSS
The choreography and lyric and  voices!! My queens!! 😭💕✨💕✨💕✨💕
no mames dura 2 minutos muy ahuevo. jype vete mucho a la verga. pero me gusto 👍
No hay MV?! what JYP?😭
welcome back ❤❤❤❤
CONGELEMOS LAS VISTS😮😮❤😮❤😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😮🎉😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😮 😮😂😮😂😮😮😂😅❤😅❤😅🎉😮😂😮😅😂😅🎉😅🎉😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😮🎉😮🎉😮🎉😮😅😂😮😂😢😂😮😂😅😂😅😅🎉😅🎉😮😂😮❤
Every member is serving looks today!! The styling is perfect and they’re glowing! Totally obsessed.
PRETTY
I don't follow them or anything but damn I love Savanna
I still like them, but I like the vocals a little Give us more songs. Girlset
I’m like OBSESSED!!! THIS IS SUCH A BANGER
事務所ちゃんと彼女達を大事に大事に玉のように扱うんだぞ🫵成功を信じてるからね🥺🩷
Jyp no sabe promocionar bien o darles buena calidad a sus artistas, es buena la canción pero el escenario mmm...
the m/v ended before it started
Go girls gimme all
1:39 EDTA GRITANDO O CANTANDO?JAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJJA JAJAJAJJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJA
LETS GOOOO GIRLSET IS BACK
song is so good that i had to watch it all over again
마침내 ㅠㅠ 보고 싶었다구~~~
They are fucking perfect, this concept suits them perfectly. ❤
Amoo
Omg❤
Oh girl set the icons you are
Que alegría tenerlas de vuelta! las chicas son super talentosas y la canción también es buena, espero se encuentren bien!♡
ATEEEE
The girls deserve better
2 Mins long??? Is this norm for POP Stars like Katseye?
WAIT THIS EATS!
🔥
Im so confused with camera work
wait this is so slay
divasss
i spent minutes searching for the "mv" bc i thought this was the choreography, im rlly disappointed, one set whole time? really jyp, but girlset ate and served
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
We want mv !!!?
Perdón la ignorancia..pero no hicieron un video oficial? No creo que sea solo este video con solo la coreografía
Sorry, I just saw girlset twerking??
COMMAS SOTY
Sorry but JYP i love your group globally, but why the america section look that poor in quality? Look it was filmed by amateurs, the song is so short and the chorus is the only thing good in this song, Stop wasting Vcha/Girlset talent by your mediocrity. You'll make your group flop again... I feel sorry for them...
woah this song slaps.. also.. kendall..... i'm in awe
You did it amazing girls
Can the cameraman back the fck up
oomgggg who are these divas
QUEENS
Feliz pre debut chicas ❤❤❤
cuma di satu lokasi?
Wtf ese es el mv?... O solo es la coreografía.. Wtf.. JYP
I LOVE IT
CONGRATS ON THE DEBUT GIRLS ❤❤❤❤
I have been waiting  for a long time to see their come back
No van a tener video? Por qué solo es la coreografía? No entiendo
FIGHTINGG❤❤ LUV U GUYSS❤
Они даже не удосужились снять им нормальный клип
Kendal dios
Honestly a slay rebranding/comeback!! Rooting for these girls
It’s like katsye 2.0

WE NEED A new FANDOM NAME & LIGHTSTICK!!!

YESSSS SO GLAD YALL ARE BACKKK!!!
Camila the best vocals
Lexusss <3
No puedo parar de escuchar la canción ❤❤❤
Lolololol the lyrics
Y EL MV???😭
This video should be over 500k views and 40k likes already come on people
Full stream a Commas ❤❤❤
Well done girlies❤❤❤❤💘
yeah queenss!!
Savannaaa
Nmss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ameeeeeee❤❤❤❤
I MEAN SPEND SOME MONEY ON ME? JYP ENTERTAINMENT ONLY SPENT SOME MONEY ON THEM. LIKE ONLY ONE LOCATION? ONLY ONE OUTFIT AND HAIRSTYLE FOR THE GIRLS? LIKE THE SONG IS GOOD THE GIRLS ARE FIRE HOWEVER WHERE'S THE BUDGET???!!!!
WHERE IS THE MV
ATE, ATE, ATEEEEEEEE DONT PLAY WITH THEMMMM!!!
This felt so rush 😅 but honestly,i'll take it. This four ensemble is so much better
I love the song and dance a lot, and they look amazing. But, I suggest JYP marketing teams be replaced entirely. What is this video with low budget and awful camera work? What made you think this must be the first video we see after we didn’t see them for more than a year? This is actually not only about Girlset, but also about many other groups under JYP. Something has been so off with most of JYP groups’ direction or marketing that those artists don’t get the attention and popularity that they deserve. I want them to flourish. Please, JYP.
hell yeah best decision since i stayed up.
yesss my girls 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Camilla hitting a high notes on Friday?? 1:37
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes I love it. All I want more. I need more ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤jyp
Y’all know what…. Take all my money!!!!
I NEED THE MUSIC VIDEOOO!! i love the dance thooo IVE MISSED YOU GIRLSSSS
What member country?
パワフルでかっこいい！！
The dance break is insane!!!
AHHHHHHH MY GIRLIESSSSS
Espero que si haya mínimo un video musical para una canción tan corta, esperaba mas de jyp que le diera lo mejor a este grupo
THIS SONG IS REALLY GOOD, HELLO??❤
❤️Kendall! Savanna! Camila! Lexi! GIRLSET! 👑❤️Kendall! Savanna! Camila! Lexi! GIRLSET! 👑❤️Kendall! Savanna! Camila! Lexi! GIRLSET! 👑❤️Kendall! Savanna! Camila! Lexi! GIRLSET! 👑
Omgggggg ameeee las amo chicas!!!! 😢😢❤❤❤ Ojala y ahora si la empresa pueda gestionarlas mucho mejor!!! Pero ustedes son maravillosas
JYP给她们多花点钱好吗？耽误她们这么久又拿一个这么穷的MV这像话吗
need the stage practice! i wanna see the whole choreo cus it ATEEEE
why is nobody talking about Camila's highnote like what
Are they gonna release a mv or not??? I like the song a lot❤❤❤❤
ATE
me here waiting for the dance covers
SLAYED AS EXPECTED😝😝
I feel like this is a good start for the direction they want to follow but the song is still... JYP clean coded. The choreography is great and the outfits are good minus some of the layering. Hopefully their next single or album really hits the global audience JYP keeps claiming they are catering to because right now its giving ITZY Wannabe era vibes, as in it has the mild kpop "edgy" aesthetic. I have to state that this is not a hate comment because some fans get crazy when people give authentic feedback they don't agree with.  I hope JYP America can conduct more research into genres that teens and young adults are connecting with and incorporate that in their next singles or B-sides. I really thought this was going down the R&B vibe when the initial concept photos were released, that would have been awesome to see especially since most of their voices fit that genre well.
So we waited almost a month for a choreo video and not an actual music video🥹
Wooow❤❤❤❤❤
happy debut day GIRLSET <3
camila on the brdige ❤‍🔥
this song is not my cup of tea. But im stilk supporting the girls. i missed them ❤
Hybe Katseye랑 비교하기 싫은데, 너무 돈 안쓰는거 아니냐 JYP는.. 아무리 Choreography ver이라 해도 그렇지. 의상이랑 스튜디오에 돈 너무 아낀다 진짜..
This is the summer bop i needed!! Maybe late summer realse but still 😂❤
Where is the MV?
girl, need moreeeee than 2:02
They ate that up and this song is so good (anyone know if this will get a M/V?)
Merecía un MV bien detallado pero igual está bien
Porque la cámara se ve tan mala? 🥀
WELCOME BACK  LITTLE MIX ❤❤🫦💋
Amazing 🎉
CAMILAAA😩😩
Is Too short
There should be a MV, is JYPE checking the wave? Please do a good job PABOO JYPE
LOVE THIS
Where is the MV?
Lo único malo de la canción es que se termina ✨😭😩✨
Súper orgullosa ❤
AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yo esperaba un mv pero con que vuelvan me siento feliz
ATEEEEE
待ってました！いっぱい聴くよー！
Fan desde que estuvieron en México
Se presentaron en vivo y fue increíble
The song is amazing but I'm worried about what happened
THIS IS SOOO GOOD !
The MV?
NGL, I did not expect the Lexus we saw during their live showcase. Her improvement compared to the A2K days is very impressive.
Stream masivo
The choreo is lit, Girls!!
MY HEAD THIS LIKE CRAZYYYYY I LIKE COMMMAS 1:21
I hope they become popular 🫶
Hello GST!!! (Girlset fandom name)
YASSS!!!
jype stop doing the bare minimum for your girl groups challenge FAILED
song length is just not ok
Мне очень нравится Но хотелось бы песню подлиннее
이거는 뜰 수밖에 없다
And my MV?? Where is it
IM FEELING SEXY NOW I CANT STOPPPPPP 😫💅🔥
The live performance was such a letdown icl, you had this long of a break but couldn't do any vocal training???
MV is coming or what??? btw this song is good tbh, yall stream hard for this banger lets go
ateee divasss!!
cool
the choreography version? okay.. It's good anyway
Lo siento pero no, una canción de dos minutos y que repiten el coro tres veces? Espero saquen mejores canciones :(
That dance was alright, but honestly, they could have changed up the set to make it more interesting. It was very static and they could have used the song better to change scenes and add some visual varity.
The choreography 🔥🔥🔥
OMGG I LOVE YOUUSS
The song is actually really good, no bias ❤
ITS YOUR TIME TO SHINE
THAT'S IT??????? NO M/V???? ONLY THE CHOREO IN 1 SET??? WHY ARE U SO CHEAP JYPE???? THE GIRLS DESERVE BETTER 😭😭😭😭😭
THIIIIIIIS THISSSS OMG 😱 IS OTHER LEVEL OMG WHAT IS THAT
Aí simmm!!!! ❤👏🏻👏🏻
They really have mature concept!
أول مغربية ❤❤
the choreo is too good!!! ,,,,,,,
JUSTICE FOR KG.
entonces no hay MV o qué?
I'm going to say it, I love Katseye but I've been a fan of Girlset since pre-debut and I didn't compare either of the two groups and I don't understand why they compare because the two groups are different
❤❤❤
I need a longer version
GIRLSETT
no music video.... short song.... i expected more
I LOVEEEE IT GIRLSET , I LOVEEEEE ITTTTTT🎉
Latinas mamis
No mv? But the choreography still ateee 🫰🫰🔥🔥🔥
GIRLSET IS NOW FOUR, VCHA WILL ALWAYS BE SIX. 💜❤
Lo mejor
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥uff
Ah now get it what Kendall said at the showcase interview, Commas does have a transtition from their previous group, you can see in at the first sound.
OH
2 minutes is just unfair
Yeahhhhh
Үгүэ kaylee дэбют хиигээгү юм бн😢😢
We need more camilla high notes
Ficou muito bom mesmo 😭😭😭😭😭
Dios bendiga al kpop❤
ALL ARE PURE FIRE... 🔥🔥🔥
I hope girlset becomes very famous soon
Guys girlset wrote this song and everything, they said it in their interview, if you have a problem with it then don't watch it it's that simple but I love the new direction.
I want more!!!!
2 minutes…… what are we doing 🤦‍♂️
Las amooo
The song is so good but JYP always makes the shortest songs in the music industry EVER 😭
❤
Katseye is better
I'm very confused on why this was uploaded before the mv, but the song and choreo is good
Las amooo ❤
Me encanta
I'm awfully early this time
Que decepción por jyp, esperar tanto tiempo para tan poco tiempo y que se mire barato
turn this shit off lmao
Savanna looks like Anitta
WAIT THIS EATS HARDER THAN I EXPECTED IT TOO????
OMGG
Eso bbs
Son demasiado Cool quedé omaga
❤❤❤❤❤
OH MY FUCKING GOD, WHAT IS THIS BANGER? 🔥🔥🔥
I love that the girls get to show off their voices, specifically how their individual “flavor” gets to shine, this song wasn’t an easy and generic. Choreo especially that last section where they are working together look so great. I happy for them.🎉
LIKE COMMAS!!!
THE VOCALS? THE DANCE? I LOVE IT
who ever did their outfits did SUCHHH a good job!!
OMGG I BEEN WAITING FOR THISS
This song is Fire!! Soy tan feliz que mis chicas regresaran 😭✨
After a year and a half, GIRLSET is finally back on my screen and I can’t even 😭 Missed them so much, and they did NOT disappoint!
SLAYYYYYYYY QUEENS THE INDUSTRY NEEDS HER COMEBACK FRRR ❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️🫰🫰🫰🫰🌟🌟🌟🌟
My thoughts as a day one Vcha fan (since a2k) :  The song : 8/10 Honestly, it's good! The outro is very addicting! This concept fit them so well.  The choreo is really good too! I actually like this very well.  But there's one problem... Their marketing... This song has been teased for a month. And they only rely on social media marketing. They only post the chorus for a whole month. As someone who's excited for this song since the start, ITS VERY TIRING! Please get better on marketing. These girls deserve better
WHY IS THIS SO SHORT?😭😭 I LOVE IT❤
Кто-нибудь объяснит мне почему такая мода на короткие песни?
Wuau 🤩 las chicas se ven maravillosas, y la canción está super genial✨🎉
How many international fans are here to support GIRLSET? ✋ ❤
they don’t know but Ive been waiting for this since a year ago
I don't listen to girl groups, but these new girl groups are making me appreciate the older ones more😩. Thank God for Twice, IVE, Itsy, and Aespa, etc.
Looks like wannabe katseye, it's my opinion not sorry if I hurt you
Achei que era MV
HOLY SLAYYYYYYYYYYYY
헐 기대이상으로 젛다 😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉
Por qué es tán corta?
Las amooo❤❤
ฉันงงทำไมjypไม่ปล่อยเป็นMVแต่ฉันเด็กๆมาก❤❤❤
Savannah dancing skill is really screaming JYP.. she deserve on the same league as Momo, Jihyo, Mina, Yeji, Chaeryoung, Ryujin, Mako, Rio, Maya, Jiwoo & Kyujin..
KENDALL'S PRESENCE IS SO DIFFERENT AND COOL!!!! SHES MY BIAS FS!!!!!!
Our girls are back!! 😍🔥
This is good and is very itzy coded but remember that camilla speaks spanish and lexi or kendall knows french, I believe? They NEED to do songs with mixed langauges, it has more potential for the song to get popular!
Galingg!! Labannn
Where’s the music video??? The dance is rlly good!
GODDDD IM IN LOVE 😭😭😭🩵🩵🩵🩵
OOOO this song SLAPS
Wow kendall
I'll support them forever, but I really hope JYP can treat them more better
AMIGOOOO L CANCION SUENA DE LO MEJOR ESTA INCREIBLE👻
LEXI'S DANCING SKILLS ARE SOOOOO GOOOD NGL!!!
GIRLSET QUEENSSSSSS

Lexi, I’ve been a fan of you since you were in A2K! 💖✨ I’m so excited for everything you and GirlSet are doing now!
Hope they release the actual MV soon
QUEENS OMG
What JYPE why this look so cheap 😢
OMG KENDALL AND CAMILA!!!!
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Why the hell did they have to do a performance and not a music video? This song has too much potential for JYP to waste it like that.
fire
guys I'm gonna learn this dance tomorrow
❤❤
so...there is no mv?
Ahhhhh yayyyyy
Ameee❤
THE DANCE IS ON FIRE 🔥
I’m crying so much, I waited for this!!!! I love you girls so much, thank you for coming back!!!! I’ll stay streaming any time that I can!!! Thank you, I love you always. 💗

Not them posting this 😭 they meant to post the Mv
Girlset tiene un concepto como itzy y Ariana Grande combinados
LMAO
What about the mv

WHY 2MINS ONLY!!!!?
THIS SONG ATEE IT GIVES AESPA VIBES LIKE WHAAT?

Manifesting success debut!!!
The song is so good! i kinda wish it had a more extended bridge
This is fireeeeeee!
WHY SO SHOOOORT!!! But I’m so glad my girls are back, congrats Girlset!
Wish JYP could have spent more than $8 on their redebut vid tho.
THE GIRLS ARE BACK!!!!
Yo sí quería un MV.😿
Now this is what we've been waiting patiently for.  Welcome back girls.  Song is fire.
“My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined”

❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
everything ATE! instrumentals, vocals, dance, visuals!
Well there be a mv too or just the choreography version?
Its not bad , but some of the dance moves remind me of Katsye abit. I feel like they can use better chorograpghy for there dances abit. The vocals are there though   But the video doesn't match much either.    Atm I give this video 7/10
This song is bop
The perfect song ❤
THE GIRLS ARE OFFICIALLY BAAAAAAAACKKKK
still flop even though they changed their name and lost some members, they won't be able to match Katsaye😂
🎉🎉🎉🎉
THIS DEBUT JUST GOT SLAYYYY 🗣️‼️
WOAAHHH DAMN THIS IS GOOD
let's all support GIRLSET's debut! they've been through a lot for the past years. They deserve all the love we can give out there! ♥♥♥♥

THIS IS SOOO GOOOD OMMMGGGMGMGM
Genial
Ahhhh obsessed is an understatement!!! This rebrand is everything. I'm looking foward to new music
seriously no music video?!
Es enserio JYPE. Así haces un re debut? Esto es bueno únicamente por el talento de las chicas, porque nisiquiera te esfuerzas en crear un escenario adecuado si solo pensabas dar un video performance. Y en el live, el escenario era muy pobre en vista y ni siquiera había un ambiente adecuada para que las chicas se expresaran. En fin, quiero mucho a las chicas, así que seguiré apoyando.
LO AMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
YESSS
Se siente tan irreal
🔥🔥🔥
Were so proud of you my girls 💞💞
THESE MV ATE SO MUCH I LOVE YOU GIRLSET!!!!
That was amazing!! 🔥
omg it’s so good but so short
perdón, no puedo dejar de mirar a lexi 😻😻😻
Love it ❤️✨
Ahora a fin a debutado a partir de aqui consideraré VCHA su predebut
Estoy muy feliz de tenerlas de regreso 🫶🏻
They came to seal the Hoonmoon
Un año por dos minutos de canción, vete a la mierda jype, de igual manera, las chicas lo hicieron muy bien y la canción me encantó, pero nisiquiera un mv esto es el colmó

I’m so proud of you girls. You’ve worked so hard and fought for your dreams. So admirable. It pays off. You are all so breathtakingly talented in both singing and dancing. Lexi, your hard-work didn’t go unnoticed. Kendall, I admire your balance between gentle and powerful. Savanna, you shine like a star, that strength is incredible. Camila, you are the definition of an IT-girl, talented, kind, and beautiful. GIRLSET is going to make it big. ❤
