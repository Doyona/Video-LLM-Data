Can’t stand her but she’s a great dancer. Should not have been eliminated .
We are!
This spectacular honor for the band queen and Len good man
Not original song but I love it this version it's freaking kicks ass lol ❤  I like to sit back and drink an  Cold bush light 3 pack and one keystone light and watch this spectacular band performance  with kick Ass sounding horns   The band did an incredible job playing this song very amazing job ❤ woooo woo shout out to amazing band and horn players
Perfect? ❌ Golden retriever energy? ✅   😂
I'm gonna tell my kids about this
Our scores:   Me: 7 Diya: 7 Kelsey: 7 Owen: 8 29/40 How can you not like him? He’s adorable, and a pretty decent dancer too. For me it was the most enjoyable dance of the night, so much energy and personality. The timing was off at the beginning but he picked it back up, and the whole performance improved. Definitely a possible finalist.
10/10
Love this guy! He is amazing!
keeping up with rylee is no easy task, that girl is an absolute monster when it comes to jive but he killed it!
Watching this performance for the nth time now. Hope Stephen and Rylee win the Mirrorball
This man can dance very good and he always be a good dancer and I think he is so cute ❤ ❤ ❤ and I very do like this guy because he is kind of nice he very is
Wait he's pretty good
So humble yet so much talent.  Rooting for Steven, Danny, and Ilona.
He’s adorable.
I'm so happy to see all the views this is getting!  These two are joy and sunshine!
I Know That Stephen Nedoroscik Is A Gymnast But He Looks Like Someone From The Goldbergs
#teamarnoldpommel for the win for the trophy👊🏻🏆🏅💛💖💙
If Stephen decides to have a different career. He could be an amazing dancer!

Winner winner ❤❤❤❤
I love him!  Seeing him enjoying the moment puts a big smile on my face! 😁😁😁
Stephen N’s performance was superior to all the other performances in the first episode! Joey was very good too, but Stephen was better. And to give his routine the same score that other mediocre performances received was not right at all!!!! In my humble opinion, the judges were way off in giving him three “7’s!” The TV audience may not be professionals, but we are not blind either! I can see Stephen getting three 8’s maybe, but I really thought he would’ve been awarded the very first 9! His performance deserved it!!!! After watching all the prior performances, and then suddenly it was his turn, and he just lit up the entire stage! Disappointed the judges ripped him off big time!😮😊
Davis Margaret Hall Angela Moore Matthew
Such a pleasure to see someone with actually no dance experience on this show, giving it all his hard work and attention and just having a blast in the process. What a joy to watch this! I hope this couple goes all the way to the Finals. Looks like a great partnership.
He’s so amazing
He was fabulous.  And what a cutie! He might just win this.
It's giving theater kid in the best way possible
Thompson Matthew Johnson Lisa Anderson Mary
MY WINNER
for ‘something’ that tries passing as a woman who can pick up a man several times during a dance, makes me more uncomfortable than Anna Delvey did…
What a fun performance.  He's gonna go far in the competition!
Ross Greens
Look like scottie Pippen  out there with his hair down 😅
He's gonna win
Feel like he's probably going to break multiple pairs of glasses at this point
This just makes me smile 😊
He is pure joy to watch!❤❤❤
Hoping this is the dance done if they do a redo week, it’s already exceptionally good, I can only imagine how it can get even better. This piece is one of those pieces that remind you how beautiful and touching dance is
Dancing seems very natural to him.  Olympic gymnasts are no joke. 💪
One to keep your eyes on.
And this is just the first night! He got this quick.
He looks like he’s having so much fun! I hope those glasses didn’t break, though 😅
Bosco Canyon
10/10
Give him the mirror ball now!!
Was it just me or does Steven's dancing remind you of Patrick Swayze. VERY similar body type and steps!!! 😮
I LOVE the deliberate toss of his glasses...just like he ditches them before his pomnel routines. A cute, great way to start.❤️
Taking off the glasses = superpowers unlocked GO POMMEL HORSE GUY GO! Absolutely loved this performance
We are . .  . pommel horse guy.
32/40
Wow. Great Job. You can tell he is a professional athlete.
I wonder how many pairs of glasses he's going to go through before each performances, tossing his glasses over to the side?
Conrad Extension
Mable Rapid
Julio Course
He must be protected at all costs ❤
Tom Holland vibes
People underestimate him, he's a freaking Olympic level gymnast.
Flatley Estate
omg wait his quickstep is gonna be so good his athleticism is already there
hope he wins !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Myrl Row
Team Phaedra!!!!! Go Girl!!!!
Ok but he’s actually insanely good already. This is an incredible pairing!
Weird that I cried watching this?!? Just so much joy and pureness and I LOVED IT! Can't wait to see his other dances this season!!!
Geigh af😮
I don't usually watch DWTS, but I am here for Stephen and his fabulous enthusiasm and moves! Well done!
Loved this. They both looked like they were having so much fun. I smiled the entire time.
So much fun!!!!!

Ok Ms.Parks ❤

What was their score? This looked so fun!
This guy is awesome!
Loving this duo!!
Loved it!
He has definitely danced before !!!!!!!!!
Fire Alfonso and I’ll watch the show again
Scores  me 8 Abby 7 Matt 8 23/30
This dance literally made me tear up because I’m so happy for Rylee and Stephen just looks SO HAPPY! If anyone watches Strictly in the UK, this pairing reminds me of Joe & Dianne from the 2018 season. 🩵
Stephen and Rylee had an amazing first performance. His lower body, the dynamics in his kicks are looking great. His smile is infectious! I think he needs another week or 2 to loosen up the upper body but I am so excited to see his dancing evolve! Rylee as always cooked. They are gonna kill it this season!
This guy appears to be real good at absolutely everything! Loved the Rubik's cube nod.
Stephen is an awesome dancer!!
Omg I'm so proud of Ms.Parks🫶🏾 lm so here for this🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Phaedra looks AMAZING!!! 😍😍😍Love the moves!!!🔥🔥🔥
Love this kid!
Are there seriously unable to find NO brown skinned female ballroom dancers in over 20 years of this show
Rubic’s cubes! very on brand
Anderson Maria Johnson Jessica Williams Carol
That Body definitely not Fake
Am I the only one who misreads his last name as "Nerdososcik"? 🤓
Hal Walks
The energy in this performance is amazing!!! I can’t wait to see his performance next week
Wow ! Great Job
I don't watch the show cause there're no stars in it.
When does the show come on

Stephen is a genius. A born dancer, he is a classic 10-dancer, fast and elegant. Precise movements and awesome energy. I'm really looking forward to a Viennese waltz and a quickstep from him. Latin dances will go great. Congratulations to him! Let him win the whole race.
HE WAS STELLAR! he and Chandler killed it! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
How is child seeing? I know that on the horse he’s pretty much going on instinct. You Superman!!! Liking and voting for you!! Go team Stephen!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Killed it ❤❤❤❤❤
Given that he’s a gymnast I feel like they are absolutely going to be a pair to watch this season!! They looked like they were having so much fun honestly.
I love his energyy
Best first dance time ever!!!!
Omg that was so much fun!!
He was awesome!!!
How is this reality
He's got this in the bag, at least runner up or third .
I have a feeling there going to win this season
She was amazing!
He got ripped off. He was much better than "7's"
That twink deserves to win the mirror-ball trophy 🏆 💪🏼
He’s so handsome 😍😍🥵
I wish Christopher Reeve could see this.  It's like a blind man took off his dark glasses just because they fall off when he does the pommel routine, then everybody started shouting, "We must put you on the runway!  I only want you as the model for my collection!"  "You belong on magazine covers!"  Meanwhile to the blind man, they might be saying, "You are really really really ridiculously good-looking," but he doesn't know what that is.
Wow I didn’t like that at ALL
Work that peach
The Rubik’s cube set is killing me
Cleora Corners
America's sweetheart
He's really good, because of course he is.
La mejor pareja de todas! El es gimnasta, por eso tiene ritmo, elasticidad, y técnica. Es la pareja a vencer.
Score?
Our friend Steve! ❤
This is a great paring
I'd like to see a tuck, pike, or even layout in the next dance.  You perform those splendidly!  It is so fun to watch you dance!
Oh, I love him so. Really playing to his strengths already
Stephen did a great job out here! Can't wait on what he'll perform next in DWTS... 👏🏻
As Len would say, the tricks were great but where there was jive there wasn't enough razzle dazzle..
I love their vibe together, like two best friends just having a fun time!! People forget that chemistry doesn't need to be romantic or sexual in order to put on an amazing performance. They just seem like two besties having the time of their lives and I am here for it!!! 🤩
Stephen Rocked it!
we love you pommel horse guy
they have the highest potential of winning the mirrorball
and also i forgot to mention the fact that the score they got was the highest score harry got last season-? yeah i’m so happy for rylee
I don't know who this is.I just clicked on it.'cause it had so many views
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Just when you thought this kid couldn’t get any stinking cuter 😜
Go Steve!!!!!❤❤❤
She is definitely not a star. She's a criminal.
i love that lindsay is so supportive of her sister and this season rylee isn’t standing under her sister shadow
A jive this good on week one is a POWER MOVE! He's going to kill this season
Rylee and Stephen, Electric performance! Please consider Pommel Horse Guy, Superman, Supersonic Man, or Mr Fahrenheit and to choreograph a dance to Teena Marie's "Portugese Love". Good luck!
He’s gonna win
My gosh, he is so good! And I love the Rubik's Cube theme.
I'm sure this has been said before, but I'm so glad that this time around.She has a better partner. I was happy that xochitl won last year. But this year , I hope Rylee goes far this season and maybe even to the final at least. There's a few others that are good too this season. But I hope they both do good.
okay but why was this so good 😭
That singer can sing!!!!!🎤 0:32 ❤
Cmon Superman dang your sexy!!!❤❤❤
Wilson Mary Jackson Kenneth Taylor Jason
No doubt you getting high scores
She's serving up body.
Get it girl ❤
William Pine
this is what it feels like if you are on shroom
Wow the mirror ball goes too lol
I’m just glad people pronounce his name right
Stephen came out absolutely swinging for his first dance! So much energy and movement all over the floor. He’s gonna evolve into a damn near unstoppable monster by the end of this
Hope those weren’t his actual glasses that he threw lol.
Is it just me or was that awesome??? They really better do a superman dance at some point. I hope they are securing a proper license.
❤❤❤❤
He's adorable!!!
I watched this 1000 times so far!! He is too cute!!! I love this pairing!!
Jesus saves! Come to know Him! Romans 5:8, John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9.
The way he came out and CRUSHED IT! He kept up with Rylees impressive footwork so well and he’s just an absolute cutie. If he keeps dancing like this with that much visible joy on his face, I guarantee he’ll win 👏🏻💐
🙌🙌🙌
Calling it now it should be Stephen, Chandler and Joey in the finals if they keep up the momentum from week 1 and we dont have any stupid shocking eliminations of the best dancers
They should of received a higher score. He is amazing we needed a Super Hero during these hard times. Thank you Steven for bringing the world a huge Smile ❤
These are my winners
This was such a fun routine!
I can see him in the finals🕺💃 😂..hope he wins the ball to go with his rose gold Olympic metals..😂
Watching this was my first genuine smile today ❤❤
He’s got huge potential!
THEY ARE SO PRECIOUS I CANNOT STOP SMILING WHENEVER I WATCH THIS DANCE THEY WERE SEVERELY UNDERSCORED JUST PERFECT
“Apolo and Julianne”. They will win
Bro this was good! Especially compared to some of the other dances.
Smith Village
He’s so fricken DAMN CUTE. The minute I saw him on screen I wanted to protect him at ALL COSTS!
looooove him and his gorgeous spirit! just pure fun
Such a cute pair!  I hope they make top 3!!!  He is endearing.
WE ARE. Way to go Stephen
He's FUN To Watch! I Hope He's In It For A While...🎉
Some of the show’s best winners and contestants overall have been athletes. After seeing this I’m not worried about Stephen at all ❤
He’s terrific!
YES STEPHEN!!!!
i never seen someone so obviously out while still in the closet.
he was a little rushed in the beginning sequence and i feel that's why he got 7s over 8s. awesome dance for week 1 and i'm really excited to watch his improvement! go stephen!!
OUR WINNER BABYYYYY!!! IM SO EXCITED FOR RYLEE THIS SEASONNN <3
Absolutamente maravilhoso ❤ obrigada por essa performance 🎉
This dance was fantastic! Loved Stephen and Rylee's enthusiasm and chemistry. I also loved that they honoured Stephen's skill with the rubik cube background haha <3
Stephen just killed that routine!!!!  Love the song, love the routine!!!  I only got nervous when Stephen jumped over Rylee's head but he killed that too
I love him....go Stephen
the best's so for
Antonio Meadow
I absolutely loved this. They were both amazing. So fantastic! I've been a fan of Stephen since seeing the Olympics now I'm a Rylee fan too. She is a great partner for Stephen.   I am a proud STEM nerd (I have bs degrees in chemistry, biology and a doctorate in pharmacy) and this performance has so many connections: -Pommel Horse guy (engineer)  -Rubik cube -Song choice is full of science: 🔥I'm burnin' through the sky,  yeah, 200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey I'm travelling at the speed of light. I wanna make a supersonic woman of you " 🌠I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger Defying the laws of gravity" 💣"ready to reload like an atom bomb"   Thank you Stephen for representing us so well and showing the world that just because you are a STEM nerd doesn't mean you can't do other things. Including infiltrating Dancing With The Stars! I can't imagine they every thought thru would have a Rubik Cube themed set. I hope that your example shows young Nerds that there's nothing wrong with liking science and math and enjoying puzzles. It's okay if it's part of who you are. 😊 Growing up I had Scully from the X-Files as someone I wanted to be like. If I was a kid now I would definitely want to be like Stephen when I grow up.
I love him!!
Dies snyone knoe the titlee of the song?
Stephen has a smile that absolutely lights up the room! You can’t NOT smile while watching this guy!
Ima Harbor
Herman Mountains
The start was iffy but the guy has energy, flexibility, and likeability in droves
“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world.
that was absolutely amazing!
Yayyyy shes got a great partner this year ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
speaking of 'having a good time', Stephen could NOT STOP SMILING!!! love it!!
He was good.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
This pair is so much better than Harry last year. You can tell he’s enjoying it. And he’s actually moving, unlike Harry
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Yes they are so fun to watch but can we also show some appreciation to the lead singer KILLING IT and living his best life in the background!!!
👏🏾🔥🔥 lets go Phaedra 👏🏾😍
Sooooo good. I'm only watching this show because of him!

OBSESSED
Okuneva Ridges
Killed it!!!!
my god, he can't see, how does he do it?
This was shockingly good. wishing him all the best this season
I agree that he would be amazing with more ballroom dancing training. The couple were fun to watch.
Love this kid. ❤
How cute! I’m surprised he dances that well.
Nice but that's gotta be one of the ugliest pro outfits ever on DWTS. Is that supposed to be sex?
So Great
One of my favs! He’s adorable.
Destini Valley
I loved this dance! Favorite of the night. So excited for Stephen and Rylee this season 😁🎉
impressed
Yes, she so deserves this guy after last yr with Mr. Stiff Harry! Hope they get to finals!!
Christophe Squares
Wowza!! I love this guy!! You can tell easily his athleticism but am so surprised at his dance ability. Way to go Steven!!!
Stephen has so much charisma and his pairing with Rylee is perfect!
That's the best thumbnail you could come up with?!?! Fail
He was awesome!!
omg she got a good partner this year, i hope they go to finals
Miller Rapid
Ahhh I want them to winn
I was expecting for them to get straight 8s. This was the best dance of the night. Sooooo good. wow❤
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Holy shit!! That boy CAN DANCE!!!!
Ohh they're jiving for sure. Amazing
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Wow! He is talented!
Omg!He was amazing! I hope he wins! He’s a pro!
Great job, this video was very useful!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
I am happy for him.  Happy that the dancer and him did great.
I feel like the pro's outfit kinda made it hard for me to follow the moves.
This seriously almost made me cry.  I love him.  Such JOY!  I've watched it SO many times!
Here’s the deserving winner! If Bachelor nation doesn’t unfairly vote him out…🙄
If you’re seeing this comment I hope you become a multimillionaire.

Steven, please use this as a springboard to a broadway career!!
You explained this so well, thank you!
Jive week 1 is no joke. Well done!!
You can really see that he's worked hard! I can't wait to see what he can do once he's danced for longer. His sincere desire to do well is pretty much radiating off him, and every time that man smiles the world gets a bit brighter.   He isn't all the way there with musicality, but that's a thing that comes with experience... Out of the gate this is amazing 😁
Dancing the Jive, with his partner Rylee Arnold, it’s Stephen Nedoroscik
Stephen is millions of times better than the rest here… the most golden retriever human and I love it!

Great ! This guy has a dancer's body.
Good job!! I love this guy's attitude and smile!
Rewatching, you can see that the flexed feet were part of the choreo and his feet were def pointed when they were supposed to be! Incredible first performance!
having a jive as a first dance and it being THIS GOOD is crazy
He is soooooo cute 🥰
You explained this so well, thank you!
After Harry I think Rylee can finally showcase stuff with Stephen
You explained this so well, thank you!
Thank you for the great content!

I love him
adorbs 😊
He's an Olympic Gymnast (2 Time Bronze Medalist) so it's expected......AND HE WAS FABULOUS!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
PLEASE MAKE THIS CRAP GO AWAY!!!!!!!
A little too much energy even for a jive, but I’m so happy Rylee has a partner she can dance with instead of around this season. I see him making the finale.
Wow he killed it!!
The very start of it was slightly wild and messy, but then he got into the rhythm and rocked it!
That was adorable!!❤
my fav one so far
I'm not crying,  you are!
Definitely my favorite pairing this season!
Can we talk about the singer in the background at 0:32 just absolutely EATING this moment? 👏
Yayyyy
MY boy...loved him at the Olympics   and hes a Massachusetts boy
She was working that fajita
Loved it  and I expected to be a mess....I want them to win
I so loved it....and totally unexpected!!!
Knowing that the "up" action in jive takes a lot of practice, he really has talent. Plus he's athletic.  He will go far.
Remember he can’t see without his glasses so did that dance basically blind.
They're both so freaking adorable, I love them so much
I loved this!  It looked like he was having so much fun.  That is a difficult dance to do the first week.  But, how could he see?!
What If Stephen & Rylee Be the Jordan Fisher & Linsey Arnold 2.0
YESSS!! They were so awesome and the energy! He's a natural - wait a few weeks in!!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
I love that guy!
i enjoyed rylee's choreography. i think stephen's dancing was kinda stiff at times.
Super man on the house… love this guy.. they should go far in the competition!👏👏👏👏
Very well done, appreciate this video!
He did amazing. Love this pair❤❤❤❤❤❤
Now that’s a breath of fresh air!  He seems to really enjoy what he’s been learning.
loved it excellet.and for sure having fun..keep it up...hell go far..Rylee was dressed great and dance choreo was fun
This made me so happy.
That was so cute! I loved it!
Amazing! Best of luck to you!
that is the hardest first week dance i have ever seen, and he NAILED it. this duo is winning everything!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
❤❤❤
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
i think it’s really funny that the gymnast had to be told to point his toes. he definitely will not hear the end of that from his teammates
Omg they’re so cute I love his smile
Amazing! They have such an authentic fun energy! My favorites! 🎉
This was INSANE. Yeah, I did understand the critiques that the judges gave to him but it was an impressive routine nonetheless. I’m rooting for Stephen and I’m glad he’s partnered with Rylee, she’s amazing! I absolutely lost it when he JUMPED over her!!
You explained this so well, thank you!
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
He's really a cutey!  He needs to do a Clark Kent/Superman routine!
I love the Olympians that are performing this season! Great energy!
He definitely a favorite its between Stephen Chandler and Joey for me for the finals!   This Jive was fun fast and they have a great positive partnership
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Great job, this video was very useful!
❤🎉 Que ganen ellos 💖💖

Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
WOW he's such a performer! what a great start for him. that stage was perfect.... I knew he'd be a star at the olympics after trials but MANNN he's like the perfect pick for this. in mens gymnastics we don't get to see much emotion except for celebrations after events, but he'd do fantastic at a womens floor routine in the artistry category!!
Thank you for the great content!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
You explained this so well, thank you!
Incredible job. Steven can move and such a great pairing with Rylee!!! I rewound 4 times to watch  WTG
His musical phrasing is so good
they look so happy and so cute
This was soooo good!!! I love how they used his skills! Awesome job!!!
Love it! I always give credit to the singers as well. They’re so talented
The big wink at the beginning was so cute😂❤
OMG I genuinely love this pairing! Rylee seems so much more experienced and confident, while Stephen is so energetic and charismatic!
I can’t help but imagine him doing a song from Goofy Movie for Disney night
He is so cute.
A M A Z I N G!!!!!! Is there no end to Stephen's talents?  Superman strikes again!  Keep going, Stephen!  I am a fan!
Omg this was amazinggggg
Love , Love ,Love ! ... ,🤓 Pommel Horse Guy is great at everything, he should run for president!
Ok we have a winner for this season!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Wow
it’s so hard to not smile watching this performance it’s not just them performing but you can tell they are having so much fun doing the dance as well 🥰
Frantic and fun with lots of tricks.  He is definitely going to be there for the entire run this season.
KINGGGGG !!!
You explained this so well, thank you!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
absolutely loved this dance! for this difficultly of choreo, he absolutely killed it and his footwork was already incredible. can’t wait to see what he does this season!! FUTURE MIRRORBALL WINNERS!!! ✨✨✨🪩🪩🪩
Awesome
Amazing content as always!
So glad to see him do well! What’s up with the production of the “live studio audience “ audio? Seems like some generic background track. I didn’t get to watch live , is it the same when live? 🤷🏻‍♂️
This season isn’t even gonna be fair lol
It’s a bird! It’s a plane! No.. it’s America’s friend Steve! 🤗🇺🇸
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
You explained this so well, thank you!
This was super helpful, thanks!
Gymnasts can knock it out of the park!!!
HES A STAR
This guy is so cute.  To be that flexible as a human being is amazing.  Go Stephen!!!
This brought so much joy! They were great together. And the flexed toes that the judge took off for… it looked planned. Both of them had flexed feet! Cute choreography!!
Amazing content as always!

Omg ! Again with this one NOT really 100% the way she teach is all over the place and has nothing to do with the partner.  She's just not at the level and not even close to her sister YET ..🤷‍♀️🧐🤔💯
Great tips, thanks for sharing!

Rylee’s choreo is so so so fun!!
My favorite dance of the night. Love this pairing.
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Stephen gave us such an energetic & fun Jive! He’s the perfect partner for Rylee as her choreography is so incredible! This was one of the best first dances!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!

Great job, this video was very useful!
He was great! Men gymnasts don't always translate to dancing since their sport is more about brute strength than women's gymnastics, so I was happily surprised! I haven't watched this show since they fired Tom Bergeron, but now that I know Stephen is on this season, I'll start watching.
Great job, this video was very useful!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
He's just adorable !! What energy! Has such joie de vie !! Love him.
That's a lot more work on his legs than he's used to. 😂
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
ATE!!!! We need to vote guys
I love the energy,  you can see he's having the best time.  Stephen is amazing and refreshing. His down to earth attitude is as big of a winner as he is!!

Great video! Really enjoyed it.
He is so adorable!
I actually think there is a good dancer in there. Give him a couple of weeks and I think he could pull out some 10s
If they don’t get a pommel horse for him at some point…
Very well done, appreciate this video!
I've watched this SO MANY times! I'm obsessed with this partnership!!! Stephen matches Rylee's star quality so well & I'm excited to see what else they bring to this season!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!

Really appreciate the insights in this video.
He probably should've gotten an 8. Well done 👍🏿
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!

Awesome start! I was hoping Stephen might get Whitney because she’s one of my favorite pros. But Rylee is a good match. Excited to see more.
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Very good just be careful with the partner not so rough! But I think he’ll improve there everything else fantastic
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Is it just me or is this the most likeable cast in a while? (We are obviously exclding the obvious) I liked almost everyone and seems like everyone had a good first week.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
For being the first time he does a JIVE? it’s really good! Can definitely relate to going down the stairs without glasses….
Great job, this video was very useful!

He’s giving me Tom Holland vibes! Such a great pairing!
STEVVVVEEEEE!❤❤❤❤❤
GO AHEAD AND GIVE  THEM THE MIRROR BALL!!!!
he will win the whole thing he is ADORABLE!!!
The energy between her partnering with harry and Stephen is a total 180. Rylie wants to be there so she deserves someone who wants to put in the work
.💥....NRG...💥....!!!!
What a joy this young man is and what a great job he did!
love this guy he is fabulous
That was GREAT! But he is supposed to support her in ballroom dancing, right?  All I could look at was him.  He is a natural!  TEAM SUPERMAN!!  Also what would happen if they synched their wardrobe? Can they do that?  I felt like her outfit wasn't right for the dance but his was.  Being nit picky but I want to see them stop at nothing because I want him to winnnnn.
Yes!!! So happy for Rylee getting a good partner this season!
This was the bes dance
I hate they keep calling her Anna Delvey. It's literally a fraud she'd come up with and a fake last name she'd made up....her real last name is Sorokin.
This is such a great pairing! Their energy is so infectious and I can't wait to see what else they can bring!
I see a winner!😎😎😎
❤Fantastic first dance!!! Congrats to both of you!! ❤love from Finland
This is already rylee best partner. he was not scared to dance. he has energy
I already love ❤️ this couple!
Hands down, most memorable dance from last night!!  A Contender, 💯
Please he is precious
This man really can do everything🙌🏻✨
Wow Stephen has such great stage presence!
These two may be the winners!
Wow this was great.  Nice they included gymnastics elements.  Guess I shouldn’t be surprised he can do a split but wow
I know it’s only week 1 but I can feel it in my bones he is gonna make the finale and even win it honestly… like he just puts a smile on my face every time and I am so happy for Rylee bc we are gonna really see some amazing choreo with him I can feel it
I can’t stop watching this over & over again!
Ok high kick!
Awesome to see his other gymnastics skills. Flips and flexibility. I don’t think he had any flares in his pommel routine.
he was kinda all over the place and his technique was messy...gotta point those toes my dude !!   i'm interested to see if rylee can be tougher on her partner this season and get him to improve more over the weeks. i didn't love her choreography last season personally...i think a few seasons on the troupe and then becoming a pro probably would have worked better. i think alexis warr or brittany cherry should've been promoted to pro over rylee since they've been on troupe longer and have gone on multiple dwts tours.
Reminds me of Rylee and miles jives on dwts jrs
Incredible energy!!! He's adorable!  My money is on him. I bet he will improve as the weeks go on.
Love him, I'll take 14 of them rn
Love this dance; it’s so beautiful and joyful! 🤩❤️🥰😍
That was soooo cute! 🥰 He's so good! A bit stiff but great for a week 1 jive. It's also expected cause he's a gymnast, he looked a bit nervous at first, but he's a frontrunner, for sure. I love his pairing with Rylee too, they seem so bubbly and happy together
you can't NOT love him.
Loved these two it was so good ❤❤
He’s so good!! If they don’t win this season…
He had a few off time mistakes but this was really fun to watch.
They should have scored so much better. No other stars were moving like that
He can move, he just has to learn to listen to the beat of the music.
Stephen is just so awesome and for a first dance he did unbelievably good! He and Rylee are such an amazing duo :)
She looks beautiful and so happy!  I think she did a great job
I love Rylee but he can’t dance. Sorry
I love it! That flip was a great touch. You could tell he likes what he was doing and I think he did an amazing job
OMG finally rylee got a partner who can move and actually dance
The man is a national treasure! Pure joy.
Love this! They’re amazing! Team Arnold Pommel for the win!
The best I’ve seen on this show yet!!!! You can feel the energy!!! What a beautiful pairing!!!!!🎉🎉🎉 Get it guys 🪩
Okay no one can fight me on this, Steve is the most iconic men's gymnast.
I thought he couldnt see without his glasses and couldnt wear contacts either
I could tell he was really excited to get out there and perform. Sometimes a little ahead of the music so he needs to take a breath and sit into the groove bute he will learn as he progresses. Super excited for this pair 😁😁😁💯💯💯
I am amazed that he could do all that without his glasses. They deserved better scores.
WHAT. THAT WAS SO GOOD!!!!
Love them! Really nice start🎉
I had a feeling Stephen could dance and I was so right.  He's adorable and he can dance up a storm.  You go, Stephen - I think you will win it all
I watch this and smile instantly
HES SO CUTE OMG I WANT THEM TO MAKE IT TO THE SEMI FINALS AT LEAST
SO GOOOD!!!
Hell yeah, baby!  That's how you show the world what to prepare for.  Stephen, you rock it and have fun my dude!  You are going to go on and do much bigger things, I can't wait to see it!
Yes!!! ❤
Just awesome 😎
He was underscored. Many others were over scored. All VelJohnson did was stand there. Tori and the felon stunk up the place.
Honestly between his popularity, Rylees popularity and actually good dancing?! This is theirs to lose and I’m here for it!
They were amazing!!! Wow!!! My winner pick!
He did better than I thought he would.  Love him to death but I was afraid he’d look like a male gymnast doing a floor routine.  Stephen and Rylee were great for a first time dance.  That was the highest energy of any of the couples.
Rylee graduated from the Sasha/Val School For Throw A Million Moves In At Breakneck Pace And Hope Nobody Notices Poor Technique
I thought the camera work in this choreo was very bad, it didn't put the dancers to their advantage. And also, I think the choreo is mid, I already noticed that Riley takes few cool moves from Lindsay, but we saw them too many times, I think that would be cool if she choreographed with more original moves. I don't wanna be mean but I can't see Riley's signature in her choreos, and it's hard for me to appreciate them, and it also pisses me off a little bit because compared to other choreographers it gives the nepotism vibe: i got here because my older sister introduced me to people. I say this, because I am also a dancer and even though i will never want to go pro, I know the dedication and time it takes to be a good dancer and chreographer and I don't feel like they took Riley for her choreographer's skills.
Quite an upgrade from Harry Jowsey! I love this pairing and you guys did fantastic!! I couldn't help but smile watching it. 😁🎉❤
My pre top pick couple. Just have to polish it up a bit. But definitely the skill set is there.
if you don't love him there is something wrong with you
No dance training -- this kid is ridiculous -- love him!!
My cousin goes to Penn State (same school as Stephen) and he said that he heard from others that he’s extremely nice❤
I love Alan and his partner but there’s no way this scored lower than theirs. They deserves 8s. This was insanely good!
Honestly for his first time, AMAZING! Little more smoothness but I would say 9/10
He was amazing and I seriously couldn’t have even done 1/4 of that routine. How did he get the same score as Joey? Underscored
Joyous.  This guy is everything.
Felt just a lil chaotic lol but I loved it. Can’t wait to watch what he does this season. Hope Rylee doesn’t just rely on a lot of tricks though, because I think he has potential for sure! 👏
i loved this performance!! so fun! great job stephen and rylee!! ⭐️⭐️
I love the colors
The precision, strength, & eye drawing ability in those amazing legs ----- if she can tighten up the rest of the package to match those legs ••••• then this boys in the final top two.  P-l-u-s looks like an amazing personality too !!   🥰💞🥰💞🥰
WOW, Rylee looks stronger than ever. What a great pair they are. Stephen did great too.
I’m not a judge or professional dance teacher but I felt like he should’ve got at least one 8! Stephen does a jive his first week and finishes strong without losing ANY momentum at the end. 🙌 Yes, he had a flexed foot at certain times but I feel like that’s the vibe of the dance. Idk what do I know 🤷‍♀️ I LOVED THIS DANCE THO! and to think, he’s going to get better 🤯 can’t wait to see! He’s the dark horse for sure!!
So glad this show is back to how it used to be! Such a great opening!
Jenn Super 👏
He’s winning for sure
I can’t take my eyes off of rylee.She is so goood❤i love this pairing
Oh wooooow this nerdy dude can dance , he slays the house down yaaaaaaassssss
AHHH THAT WAS SO CUTE
What were the scores?
*Wow!  You did great Stephen* !  *A+*
glad she has a good partner this season. she can show her choreography better this time
He's gonna win
Ok STOP 😭 I love this so much! It's gonna be so fun watching him dance!
They looked like the leading couple of a good teen movie , and I loved it ❤
They are such a great pair! I love his enthusiasm and energy—can’t wait to see what they do for the next routine!
For me, they’re the ones to beat.  This is my team all the way!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
He definitely has what it takes to win the mirrorball
❤❤❤
I love him! 🤩❤
Yes yes yes!!!! This is the partner ship Rylee deserves! She can actually show her talent as a choreographer. This dance was more difficult than any of Harry’s and it’s week one.
Stephen seems so wholesome omg I hope he goes far he did outstanding for his first dance!!
🎉❤
Seeing Rylee go from a partner that was honestly garbage to a man that has a real shot at doing well makes me very happy.
So so so so good! Love him! ❤
What were there scores?
How many points did They Get?
Delightful!
Team Arnold Pommel!!!! I love them
10 stars from me! But the only thing that I absolutely hated was that super annoying song, lol.
Wait, he's not bad!! I was worried because gymnasts can be pretty stiff and sharp with movements (like they're doing a floor routine) but Stephen has looseness! Stoked for this season, so many fun contenders.
The smile on my face after seeing this dance🤩
I really enjoyed his energy and exuberance. If he continues like this, he’ll be standing in the top 2.
Stephen, you make me smile ❤
this kid is gonna win it all i’m calling it now
He's the best I've seen so far
Winner!
This is so better than pairing with Harry
So impressive he can’t even see without his glasses!!
SO GOODDDDDDDD
Wow!!!!
I have absolutely no experience with this show, but I feel like this is really good for a first dance???
Not bad for a first dance. I give this dance a 6.
❤❤❤
These two kids are perfect together.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸❤️
OHHHH MYYY GODDD THE WAY THAT IN SCREAMING 🥹
This dance was so much fun!!!! This is exactly what Rylee needed this season!!!! Stephen brought in the fun to this!!! Can't wait to see how far they get this season!! This was a perfect dance to start the season!!!!
The wink, the energy, the smiles!  What a colorful & fun performance!  Stephen is a natural!  👏🏽🎉🕺🏻🤩
I was smiling like an idiot the whole time watching this!
ugh I just love him 😭he did sooo freaking good too!
HOW TF DID THIS NOT GET AN 8… it’s too early to be underscoring, but anyway i am so excited to see rylee THRIVE with stephen who can actually dance (cough cough..) they are getting my votes fs‼️
Ojalá ganen 🎉
SLAY RYLEE SLAY STEPHENNNN
I WAS SO SHOCKED THAT HE CAME OUT SO HARD THIS WAS AMAZING FOR A FIRST NIGHT OH MY GOD
I really hope they get a redemption jive because his jive would be insane once he gets some ballroom training under his belt
ahh stephen was so high energy and amazing!! and rylee got so much good content in there, i’m glad we can see her choreo shine 🫶🏼 looking forward to what they do next, we def have a winner on our hands
What was their score?
Stunning!
I’m calling it: he’s going to win. I love Ilona but he’s a STAR!
the funny thing is that my class is doing a dance to that song for our yearly festival 😂❤
Stephen came out absolutely swinging for his first dance! So much energy and movement all over the floor. He’s gonna evolve into a damn near unstoppable monster by the end of this
Stephen was amazing!!!!
I love this pairing! I'm so happy that Rylee has a better partner this time around after the struggles and disrespect she had to deal with from Harry last season. Stephen seems so passionate about learning how to dance and it really shows in this routine. I think they deserved way better scores for this routine than they got!  EDIT: wow, over 1K upvotes! Very flattered, thanks everyone :)
Delightful! Reminds of that show "Beauty & the Geek".
If these two don’t win, or least make the finals, this show is rigged!
Obsessed with dwts 🤩would die to be able to watch it
Stephen and Riley are my favs ever
Great 😊 dance 🪩! That’s the queens song 🎶.
A star is born!
LOVE THIS
