You may not react to jump scares but I’m sure you still get a slight jolt and body shiver after it happens, and it’s not that noticeable for us to see. You just don’t swing head back and scream
its like a deteriorating super power 😭
How to not get jumpscared? Just have a noise gate on your headphones; if there are no sudden sounds, the chance of you getting jumpscared are near zero.
3:15 BIGGER BOOT!
this is it, hell is freezing over
He woke up and started to realise maybe it is that deep 😢
charlie have u heard of giraffe town
3:50 the R6 reference sent me ~
Did Charlie just hit puberty
Where's the second one tho
this lwk reminded me of little nightmares
she's basically the chinese assassin with the vacuum machine from johnny english
Charlie has fallen off. Time to cancel him
Unc is getting old 😭
“It was in this moment, a god king felt a very human chill run up his spine.”   NAME THAT MOVIE
its not age its  just game are more realistic and real deal now. the graphics are way clear and detailed.
That damn wolf was just a hint of what was to come
0:05 Video starts at 1:16
You're getting old, dear lad
Its easy Not to get scared If you dont Take it serious and Just make Jokes , thats the only way i was able to watch Horror movies
People that get startled by jump scares usually means that their reflexes are much faster
damn talk about clickbait 😂 the man barely flinched for the second time ever while playing a horror videogame
Jumpscares/ noises/ events at 4:15 4:49 5:30 7:35 7:47 8:34 9:25 10:17 10:40 11:10 12:24 13:43 15:01 15:12 16:02 17:04 17:20 18:51 21:48
He gets scared he just has the lights as dark as possible so we can’t see
I think the real reason Moist had such a good immunity is because he literally only uses 1 earbud while everyone else using headphones full blast
Charles: Become Human
>most mild reaction ever >'Wow, really lost my cool there'
3:16 Where's the foot?!
Clankers
‘Startle’ in the big 25 😭😭🙏🙏🙏🥀
The plane has hit the second Charlie
charlie i think it's just because you're enjoying life more and being happier makes you more receptive to stimuli
1:55 wasn’t looking at the screen and thought charlie was just speaking normally - not reading subtitles. bro is the MC
mcqueen is fading
blud gets scared by jumpscares 😂😂😂😂
How many games actually startled Charles?
You have achieved unc status
You think 31 is hard realizing your old, wait till you hit 40 and  your body just begins to fail, mainly your joints. One day I was running 3 miles for cardio like normal, next time had to stop early because my knee quit working correctly. Never been the same since.
It bothers that me no one has mentioned the part where it comes out of the closet and goes under the bed is ripped straight from Terrified.
Maybe the problem was you weren’t acting like you were playing a horror game.
He's getting weaker by the day lmao
I feel like a lot of movies and games are getting better at using jump scares.
4:15 Bro didnt even flinch
Charlie really has hit the 'mcqueen is fading' age 🥀😮‍💨
someone tell em to play wttg2 for the love of god
jeez bruh scared the shit out of me
It really is just the high volume "scaring" him, if someone blasted a sound near me stealing my eardrums virginity I would also instinctually jump, regardless of my mental fortitude.
9:35 got me 😮‍💨
mcqueen is fading
Usually as people mature they grow out of fears such as this, for Charlie he was born without fear and gained it with age
What's name of this game?
I aint too far behind Charlie's age.. i hope in 4 yrs i dont start gettin spooked by the scary again😂
Cracks in the foundation
The fact that it takes men like 32 years of living to fully mature(brain wise) makes a lot of sense in charlie’s case. Bro unlocked fear and human emotion as his last maturing feature
Somehow Charlie gave me his superpower like one for all, as I no longer am scared by jump scares, it started about last year.
I think jumpscares are working more because Charlie is in a better mood/less stressed out. I think for the last 4 years of all the streaming on YouTube drama and all the business he runs was really stressing him out. But now stepping back from all that he’s happier and gets more into these games. I know from personal experience that the scariest game in the world has no effect on you if you’re stressed out because all you can focus on is the stress.
i always liked and watched horror movies with zero reaction, the last few years they actually unsettle me, i’ll get a bit anxious alone in the dark thinking about the movie. ???? aging is weird
You know what? I'm happy for Charlie. Cheep jumpscares will always be lame, but I enjoy getting scared by a well executed Jumpscare. They don't always get me, but I was never unspookable like Charlie. Now I'd say he'd to where most seasoned horror game players are. They will not get frightened by a majority of the game, but occasionally the devs will get you good.
Just like a boxer when it gets knocked out good, it opens the possibilities for it to happen again
Oh man, I can't remember the name of that famous youtuber who retired.. Jenna... something? The ever helpful Charlie: 6:44
Did Gladys in the ceiling jump scare you in ‘weapons’?
which part did he startle? game is so trash couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing
He's finally becoming corporeal   His soul is merging with his chosen god-like body
He’s getting weak 4:15
8:40 cheese
Gap moe
doing allat the same era AI is evolving
CHARLIE, if you want to prove yourself wrong, I’d play DEVOTION. It’s a game that got taken off steam because the developer made a joke about the Chinese government with the Winnie the Pooh. It’s an amazing game with an amazing story. Definitely one of the spookiest games I’ve ever played and the atmosphere is incredible. 100% recommend the game to anyone and everyone. Hopefully you check it out! Godspeed, stay spooky.
Charles considering it a "startle" when he just hitches his breath a little 🤣 meanwhile I'd probably be peeing my pants or at least jumping up 6 inches off the chair
chupacabra flashback
unc is out of his prime
charlie will NEVER mention that he got startled at fucking fear of nightmares
I wonder if it's because playing solo vs hanging out with chat while playing?
The more scary games I play the scarier they get lol I started jumping and realized some of the reactions in videos aren't fake lol
Charlie probably won’t read this but stay at the guest house in Natchez, Mississippi. It’s an antebellum home so very old obviously. I didn’t believe in ghosts before working there but I do now. I no longer work there but I have home security footage from there showing something that would best be described as a ghost. It’s not even advertised as a haunted experience. It’s just a bed and breakfast on Main Street but it does have spirits that roam the halls.
0:57 seconds of your beautiful voice I don’t even need to watch the rest of the video. I’m going straight to the other one. I’ll come back when I’m done while I’m at it. I might as well subscribe because seeing you play scary games, I enjoy :)👍
Oooooooh so NOW i get why he turns the lights out. He doesn't want us to notice when he jumps at the jumpscares. Smart. We would have never even known had he not slipped up n left the lights on.
Nerves are shot
10:00 ohhuhhuhhhooo
Be careful old man
he only gets jumpscared when he's not streaming
Florida man discovers fear, learn more at the 6 PM news.
He got jump scared by Patrick in the Squidward horror game... my goat is washed
whos at the door cooked his invincability
I remember the days of the lack of reaction to scares and other horror media you had. Was very much the same around then too. But alas, I too am losing my immunity to the jumpscare
Charlie is developing emotions.
Star in another hunger games movie to flip the fear counter back another decade
Charlie...check your magnesium intake and levels. Seriously...liw mg can cause jumpscaredness
Horror game: He's afraid. He's afraid!
0:00 AAHH!!
Man is washed up
i hope he's gonna play some actual good horror games in the future, this was probably one of, if not the worst horror games i've ever seen lmao
i think he’s just afraid of tvs
Dread Flats joins the illustrious club of horror games to scare Charlie, among the greats like Fear Of Nightmares: Madness Descent
Charlie, please show us on the doll where the jumpscare penetrated you.
I truly believe he used to play all those horror games with barely any volume in his own headphones but it was loud for stream. Could be wrong but loud ASF noises can startle anyone just from the volume alone
ive always felt that theres a difference between being startled and being scared. jumpscares are just startling and dont have any psychological horror effect on the viewer
It almost feels as if people recently relearned how to make horror games, incredible
Has he tried Alien Isolation?
See ya
I love how fucking unserious he is while playing these games
Turns out the horror game dev have finally bringing poop to the poop fight, scaring charlie with the right tool.
I get jumpscared by literally nothing…. My girlfriend keeps catching me screaming while playing Stalker 2. Yeah not even a spooky game but damn do I scream like an old lady when looking at some box in a corner and I suddenly get attacked by wild dogs.
These are the videos we’re interested in ❤ no more useless yapping videos brother
I always thought his buff of no jump scares was a trade off for no spicy food tolerance - maybe they’ve switched!
if you love games like this please play games from red candle company they make amazing horror games that haven even gotten banned from steam from being too much
Jumpscares never worked on me, until I hit like 25, then I started jumping at someone walking in the kitchen😅
:11 erm! Compound V isn't something you're born with ! That was the whole point!
31 but i got 31 jumpscares
Clippy thinks getting scared and surprised by jump scares are normal
This video was entirely click bait.  He didn't get startled.  Everyone in the comments are either coping or bots.  He turned off his room lights, so you couldn't even see him get startled if he did.
this video is an advancement in Charlie’s lore. A turning point!
I was immune as well, until I played P.T, since then I'm jumping to anything.
reaction time dipped 0.01ms too many
I feel like if Charlie could actually use real headphones for once, I may immerse him a little more.  Can't be that scary only hearing half the audio out of a broken pair of 10 y.o. earbuds
Charlie should go back to speed running horror games. Im sure that helped a lot
He’s been replaced by a clone
I’m still immune to anything horror related. I find it funny seeing people get scared
00:36 Pause?!?!?
Debuffs starting to stackup
bro finally got bug fixed.
"Just then the king felt true fear for the first time"
indie horror gaming arc
getting old dude
getting old dude
he’s becoming human
my conclusion is that Charlie is afraid of TV'S and loud shattering glass.
“the door's stuck”  Say that again..
Bro lost his chin
don't forget 2 years ago u scared urself
jump scares are the lowest form of horror/scare, they are indistinguishable from surprise and surprise isn't fear, its ok to get surprised at a jumpscare because thats what is supposed to happen, if you dont then there is probably something wrong
Get Charlie to 20 million subs and the compound V will be at its peak again, no joke.
I’d love Charlie MORE if he’d get scared more often.
Got nerfed
Bro hit 30 and got hit with the fear of God
I still remember when he got scared by a leaf on his wall while doing a lets play. nearly destroyed his setup over a leaf lmao'
30 and up you learn new ways how you can die.
You need headphones when you play games lol more effective
Hey, it's cool being able to read some of the Chinese now 😂 study a second language y'all. It's amazing. Chinese a millions of times easier than I thought too
YOURE A YEAR OLDER THAN ME QUIT SAYING WE ARE OLD 😂😂 been jumpy lately myself. But it's probably all the tyranny keeping me on my toes 😅stay free ❤
yo Charly what earphones do you use?
Okay Dead Still
He transferred it to me, after watching him play so many bad horror games (and Markiplier doing the same) I'm just unaffected by jumpscares
Jesus powers are fading... 😞             Hey, hey, hey! Put the giant cross down! That is not what I meant!
wth
You being able to be jump-scared means that 1) you're human and 2) you'll probably be a much better horror let's player, now. Look at IGP's numbers, people love the screams and carrying on.
Yooo Charlie check out the movie weapons and let me know what you think they had 2 Jumpscares in there which actually were good
I remember watching The Conjuring and realizing I could no longer tank jump scares raw
play nun massacre
"The ability to penetrate me" - Charlie
Man the mold/germs comment is so real, I’m always concerned and slightly annoyed when I see people going through turbo run down abandoned locations with no mask on, like can you not risk dying to the one two combo of mold and asbestos please I want you to keep uploading
McQueen is fading!
Does Greece know about this?
Welp time to unfollow and report for scam
5:58 The real reason he turned off his lights is so we wouldn’t notice his vulnerability
Unc is getting old😢
the age is catching up
5:20 the game became real-life accurate for him.
You've started enjoying games again. So you actually commit enough to get scared.
9:31 made me laugh so hard 😂
Bro needed 31 years on this planet for jumpscares to finally get him
“Sounds like I’m playing as myself”  No wonder he got scared, his immersion is peaked
WRONG  We all know the first jumpscare that startled him was that chuppacabra with half second of audio and no animation  The second was his cat
when he hits 32 hes gonna start believing in ghosts
I get scared when a object shakes and Flys off and hits me. 😅
old age hits harder than expected
As soon as Charlie turned 31 he got hit with a massive nerf. The Earth devs really did him dirty.
as charlie enjoys games more his own emotions react to things, makes sense
That’s just cause Chat isn’t there to distract you with their flaming dog shit takes. We are good for you 😌
Charlie will never be the same after getting scared 😭🙏🏽
Charlie, you will never find the paranormal by looking for it. You dampen the quantum fluctuations that allow for it. You dont find the paranormal so much as it finds you.
He hit 31, and death updated his human side.
This happened to me at 30 too, along with the ability to feel spice. I can still do super spicy, but I sweat and tear up now
im absolutely loving your gaming channel
ITT: Pro gamer learns how to game.
After 31 years, they finally decided to release a patch and nerfed him.
Remember that Jesus died at 33
As a 35 year old I can assure you it only gets worse.
They got bots on Charlie's channel now 🥀
Same bro. I used to eat horror for breakfast. Now I still enjoy it, but I jump more often. I kind of like it better now as a result though.
This happened to me, except it’s for rollercoasters.  Damn near over night they became a complete nope for me.
It’s because you emotionally detach yourself from the games not even trying to let yourself see yourself in the story, and continue to spout random crap and put down the games to further detach
is this a recession indicator?
"Mr. President, a second jumpscare hit Charlie."
This is when MoistCritical became MoistJumpscareCritical
We don’t actually think 30 is old, right? W-we’re still young…right?
Hearing youtube red made my ears perk up
You are getting old charlie.
This should have more views 😂
I don't think you can be immune to jumpscares, but you can pick up on the pattern of when a jump scare is incoming. It takes someone who actually understands how to manipulate their audience to make a jump scare effective and most horror creators simply don't have that sauce.
WHERE?? WHERE IS THE JUMP SCARE?!! >:(
Charlie plays horror games to try not to be scared. Like a kid punching a wall and thinking he’s tough. You have to let go of your ego and just play
You're just getting old man
You’ve grown soft old man
Just then, The Old Man Felt True Fear for the first time
Breaking news: Fearless man discovers fear,  now no longer fearless.
I grew up watching horror movies way to young. My mom loves them and I remember being as young as 4 and 5 watching Halloween and Friday the 13th. Horror has obviously become my favourite genre not only because its what I grew up watching most, but because of all the sub genres. Found Footage is my favourite type of horror. I love them so much. I wouldn't say I am immune to jump scares, but the ones that come out of no where would always get me. The ones that happen during a scaring scene or you can tell its going to happen are not so bad.
I'm fully expecting trt Charles to make an appearance. It'll start with snacks while streaming and he'll seem to get much buffer real quick
"McQueen is fading!"
I still got mine XD
Dudes finally growing that brain tiny bit
nahh the jumpscare penetrated him nahhhhhh 😭✌️
0:35 "Hmm, fascinating, could tell us more about how this...entity 'penetrated' your defenses, Charlie?"
Oh noooo, It’s all over
30 broke the curse he had on him
This game bored me to tears watching people play it... I fell asleep every time before seeing any jumpscares...  But yes being 30yr plus nothing is the same as it used to be lol.
Charlie: Become Human
I love that you’re playing more games without streaming them. It feels like youre having a more focused and enjoyable experience overall without having to focus on chat.
Should play Visage on the gaming channel 👀👀
i’m living the same experience rn
Indie games are just getting really good at the ambient spooks. i still believe you got that natural untouchable spook brother.
Speed run it
Did something just touch me lmao
Old man
Charles becoming scared is about as bizarre as the Epstein files being unedited and released
The type of crap that men went through after they reached their near expiry date frfr
so this is what "Everything goes downhill by 30" means
Yeah I’ve gotta say that making the conscious decision to break emersion in a horror game is going to make it way less scary and give you a disingenuous impression of the game. Like tbh he’s played some pretty scary games but when you beat your mindset to be in clown mode, nothing could ever work.
This shit like an apology video🤣
I got the ai pandy scam ad lmao
Bros not enjoying his dirty 30s
McQueen is fading
I love you Charlie
Turned 31 and finally decided to stop aura farming in horror games.
Dude, I hit 30 and suddenly I like flavors I didn't like before. Something about being 30 changes you! 😂
Oh grandma! Get out from under the bed, silly!
3:10 right 😂 worried about pathogens and hazards of the environment. Sharp metal and broken tile all over lol
PETITION FOR CHARLIE TO PLAY ALL THE DEAD SPACE GAMES
I'm worried about you old man charles😢
you should make a video on goatis
for me its like the opposite, the older i get, the less i get scared or things faze me.
Bro is finally becoming human
It's past your bed time, Mr. White.
Its just because you are playing off stream and without chat, allowing for immersion
Having the icepick fully visible during the lobotomy was genius. Had to cover half my screen to watch it. Made my eyes ache.
Getting vulnerable in your old age, Grandpa.
Unc
He's washed this is crazy. This must have been how Derrick Rose felt going back to back with career altering injuries
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Charlies next video - "please don't play this game, very scary, trigger warning'
Congrats what a milestone 👏
Facts man. I’m 34 now and I jump at the smallest shit lol.
These titles are becoming clickbait
Omg. You mean. Critical doesnt have the most desirable personality and mindset on the planet...? Since when?
The more you acknowledge someting, the more you start to lose it. In this case, your immunity to jumpscare.
life really does start at 30
Wake up they hit the second tower
31 Years old - buffs removed
I turned 30, downloaded demonologist and turned into the most skittish version of myself ive ever seen.
I used to watch horror movies at night all alone in the dark like it was a religion. One day I randomly got so scared I didnt dare to sleep for 2 weeks, I always felt fear in the dark. Luckily it passed but it was strange.
Ive been waiting for this
It's easy to avoid jumpscares, when you know when they're coming, because you already watched someone else's YT video. But what do I know? I'm just here to help.
k that sht bro,.... i got startled so many times watching this... icant scary stuff at all.
There is no fucking way 31 is the Big Number that just alters your entire personality
We're witnessing how dads get nerfed by the time they're 40
heh old man
If this turns into another 31yo thing...
Coward
Not getting startled in a sign of higher intelligence, hes processing the jumpscare so fast that he doesnt physically react to it before the realization. Or the dude has genuinly the worst reflexes XD
As a 35 year old it’s been very entertaining and relatable seeing Charlie go down this arch 😂 solidarity brother Lol
clippy uprising
old
charlie is definitely going through male menopause
PLEASE PLAY THE KONQUEST MODE OF MORTAL KOMBAT DECEPTION
This the equivalent of someone hitting 30 and getting a permanent debuff until death
If i just kept yapping, try not to immerse myself and rush through, i'd also not care about jumpscares.
the age of 300 is one to be scared of
Bro's finally gaining sentiance ...
unc starting getting the side effects of 31
0:53  lmao the way he said this is with genuine shame 😂😂😂
I love horror games, played all of the greats growing up. But recently, some games just made me REALLY anxious to play them. I think the biggest offenders were Alien Isolation and SCP: Containment Breach. I don't know what it is about those games, but they just have this perfect atmosphere of dread in them. And don't even get me started on Dreadhalls in VR...
Just wait until a hallmark movie makes you feel something.  That's when you know the end is near.
"This game managed to startle Charlie" is advertisement on its own.
I honestly think the jumpscares are happening because you aren't playing on stream.
Took a man 30 years to understand the very concept of fear.
i do like when the horror games take place outside of murican
I am literally in a hotel room, it is 204. Thanks. Glad I clicked on this.
2025 seems to be a terrible year all around then huh
We've entered the DPS phase of the MoistCritikal raid.
It happens with old age!
It's probably because he's pregenant
This new era of Charlie is…🙌🏼 immaculate
@ Penguinz Here’s a tip, turn the lights off when you play horror games and watch how your heart starts to pump more
Wait 31 this dude is ten years older than me lol
the being sheds emotion.
Penguinny Nice 🖤🖤
Better take your heart medication so that the ol'ticker doesn't give out on ya from playing too much horror games.
stop playing horror games with one earphone in, thats a cheatcode brah
Hes getting rustier..
Hes always been startled by them, but hes always had chat or it's in a multiplayer game so hes able to play it off. Cant believe hes so insecure about it tho 😅
He turned 31 and started gaining consciousness and back problems 😔
idubz learned empathy and charlie learned to be startled.
This is just an ad for his second channel. What a putz.
Still waiting for Charlie to have an opinion of his own
Jumps scares are terrifying
Jumpscares/ noises/ events at 4:15 4:49 5:30 7:35 7:47 8:34 9:25 10:17 10:40 11:10 12:24 13:43 15:01 16:02 17:04 18:51 21:48
This game is really good
You're losing your powers old man.
I used to be immune to horror games but then from RE5 onward I started to lose the ability to play horror games due to being too immersed. Haven't been able to finish a horror game in years. Maybe it's the realism in the graphics or something. Or maybe I just grew up and became aware of how scary the real world is and it's bleeding into my gaming lol.
Ohhh??? Well Goddam.
i fear he's becoming more human
its almost like they are a little scarier by yourself without your chat.
Notice how he gets scared on the gaming channel and not live? Charlie’s getting scared because he doesn’t have chat to make him feel safe! Lol
Bros survival instinct has finally kicked in
Right now, he's just getting STARTLED, give it a few more years, and he'll be screaming from horror games like he screams from cockroachs
Lost his free trial status
Life past 30 really is New Game + huh.
The revolver god is becoming mortal…
The weapons movie had some that actually got me.
Charles, you're just getting old.
stop playing horror games I don't want u to get a hart attack
I find Jump scares to be some of the least impactful and honestly tasteless horror elements in movies and games. I just don't think that they're in the slightest bit entertaining or impact full. Take silent hill 2 for a great example. That psychological horror, its always surrounding you and creeping in your head. For me, and the circle of people I know, its definitely a horror that we talked about all the way up into its re-imagining recently. That being said, 37 and jump scares still dont bother me, I get irritated and annoyed by them more than anything.
Hah, Charlie got penetrated
i think this is a sign maybe everyone is collectively getting more anxious passively lately
Beware of the dreaded 30th birthday
0:58 is it just me or does it look a bit like charlie?
guya aa gape! Weak yeah BOII
It’s okay Charlie. Horror games are more interesting when they are actually scary.
The greatest fear of all time, perhaps?
Or, or the  jump scares are being calibrated over time and becoming more potent with every iteration?! Trust nothing gentlemen.
12:26 "Do you have games on your phone?"
PLAY ALIEN ISOLATION
31 year old man still gets scared the old fashioned way
The gaming channel SLAPS
Moist Critical getting up there in age, that's why.
Maybe he'll like RDR2 now
im scared
ts is not scary unc
This video makes it feel like he's got a rare disease where he feels fear.
Residents of that apartment look evil
I know Charlie won’t read this but I want to share my experience. I’m only 2 months younger and I’ve noticed the exact same thing. However I don’t watch or play anything horror related. Usually it’s from my wife or coworker playing a prank on me. I used to pride myself on not even flinching when someone tried to jump scare me. Maybe I’d blink or my facial expression would change slightly, but overall I used to be really good at having almost no reaction. Just yesterday a coworker got a slight jump out of me because they were behind me (I didn’t know) and started talking. Our powers may have faded, but we’ve only traded stoicism for self preservation.
I'm scared to turn 31 now.
damn, 31 and bro got nerfed
Charlie you have been making more positive changes to your life and its causing you to feel more comfortable and you are actually starting to feel something while playing these games.
30 years old and says "old age"
feels like tihs game had some inspiration from the movie room 1408 not the greatest horror movie but a cool concept.
Nerfing Charlie now
bro lost his prime
the character arcs of season 3 have all been insane so far but this is the most impactful one yet
I think it helps not getting startled when you’re wearing one earbud
0:38 scuse me??
31 year old man discovers fear
TLDR; comment section reads other comments, to comment the same thing over and over about previous comments
We're getting old, Charlie.
charlie has fallen off
I always find it interesting when people have zero belief in the paranormal. But I completely get it , that stuff is things you have to see to believe
when he first got "JUMPSCARED" on the other game my first thoughts were it's definitely the insomnia
One of the signs of the time.
Charlie can you review new movie Dead to Rights please. More ppl needa know
Either critikal is just getting old or horror games are really stepping it up a notch, or both
growing up is weird man, you start feeling like an adult at 25, at 27 you peak, at 30 you're an adult and you just stop counting after.
Can’t be top dog forever 😔
I still remember his biggest jumpscare over a decade ago when he saw a leaf in Medal of Honor or some shit.
Charlie and Zach are both at the opposite sides of the same case of Benjamin buttons disease and slowly zack growing and charlie wasting away lol😂
bro turned 30 and hes a whole new person 😭😭😭
Damn, 30 is really hitting hard.
Signalis next please!
Charlie getting scared is like me slightly missing the last step just enough of a reaction to realize it happened meanwhile if I get jump scared it's a full panic reaction 😂
I believe I know what happened. I was always easy to startle but the more I watched you play I believe I have syphoned your powers as I have recently over time recently become entirely immune to scares. Thank you for your power.
Hey Charlie I’ve been following for years I’ve really enjoyed these horror videos and I have a challenge for you u should go to St. John Newfoundland I’ve been there multiple times and have had many ghost encounters and they even have a very great ghost walk around the city telling you some of the old stories from way back
I zoom in on just charlie and watch him jump like 15-20 times and I feel better than I did before. Anybody else?
From the age of 1 i remember being deadly susceptible to jumpscares and emotional scenes! Cant imagine how that dont get you!
it must be the age catching up to charlie's exceptional mental strength.
Creepy game!
Mf got hit with late puberty
Using humorous sarcasm to mask his fear.  A coping mechanism.  Not fooling anyone, old man.
It's a sign of the end times.
Charlie is getting nerf at 30yo😂
Startled
His emotions are returning
Now, you NEED try VR Horror games (mods or not) and there the GAS RUNNING OUT MUCH FASTER!
your cortisol levels are prob high
Just last night I actually was big time jump-scared by the one at the end of The Nun 2 movie trailer. It got me good, too. I'm so ashamed.
That old chupacabra with 1 split second of loud noise starling Charlie was the first crack in his armor.
he finaly mortals again
You gettin soft. Or youre just getting more surprised at how bad games are getting
the older Charlie gets, the more human he becomes
charlie you should play jazzpunk on the gaming channel
Did also get jumpscared by a bee that one time.
Guys finally ran out of Senzu beans
Charlie v31 patch notes: makes him human and demoted him from being jesus
0:56 idubbbz developed empathy post 30, Charlie developed fear post 30 years old
i love that the equivalent of charlie getting scared is just "woah, that startled me"
I refuse to check out your channel even tho these highlights look good, I refuse!
Charlie's mid life crisis is getting jumpscared
Getting a little shock reaction to a jumpscare is normal. What I can't stand is those grown ass men screaming like little girls over the smallest things for content. Like their reactions are worse than the actual jumpscare 🤦🏾‍♂️
Was about to comment on his age but it seems couple of people has already thought the same
It’s happening. Jumpscares are starting to startle him, his voice becoming less monotone. He’s becoming more human
bro got nerfed while playing this game, lmao
Does this mean that Charlie has also become vulnerable to the paranormal?
He got jump scared like 6 times in his Elden ring streams when it first came out
Can confirm, past 30's and basic emotions kick in harder. That's why we drink
You’re changing, Charlie.
Don't show him any chupacabras
Man, 31s are not treating him well
Sorry broskie, but I had to downvote this one. Total clickbait - I didn't see you react any differently than usual. Which is fine except for the title, "Jumpscares Are Actually Starting to Startle Me". I maybe saw one instance where you flinched, but that was it. I thought you'd actually react more acutely given you typical reactions. Nope. Instead, you tricked me into wasting 22 minutes of my life for nothing. Still love you though.
play alien isolation on the gaming channel
Jesus loves you
Slightly on/off topic, but when IS your next "paranormal investigation"? They were incredibly entertaining even if you found it lame
Making another channel is genius. Double the revenue, you can keep doing what you do. Play more games, stop with your opinions
Having a functioning startle response is healthy lol. Sign of good health if anything, not old age!
have you tried putting your headphones to normal?
Charlie play visage
Maybe when hes 35 he'll start wearing headphones on both ears
so you don't let your imagination grab the steering wheel
If it makes you feel any better I've always been easily startled by horror games.
Bruh what is this edit. I'm sure there were so much better scares like this on the stream
It's true. Once you turn 30. It's all downhill from there. Trust me I was invincible my whole life and then I turned 30. The pains and aches started. Life started giving me more lemons than usual. It's a fucking trip lol but in the good side...lived 32 years.
That's crazy. I remember so many times where you didn't startle. I always think Markiplier or Jacksepticeye and so on with startlings. I love all the times where you pretend to startle in multiplayer horror games to deliberately scare the other players. Different time now huh... Also have you checked out Resident Evil's predecessor yet: Sweet Home?
WAIT WHERE DID U ACTUALLY JUMP? U LIEDDDD
5:25
in charlie’s defense he keeps saying that his audio is loud on everyone of these jumpscares which we’ve always known has been the number one thing to get an reaction out of him
"penetrate" "did one of these" *bounces on it* 0:35
I too was immune to jumpscares and horror games in general throughout my teens and early adulthood. But now I'm 29 and I'm a scaredy cat. The last horror game I played a year ago was Alien Isolation and I was terrified the whole time. If I had played 9 years ago I would've breezed through it with a deadpan stare.
Its the old age
Bros can't lock in because of his age
Youre getting fragile, old man
Man turned 30 and started playing with the lights off without chat yelling at him
Oh hey Jack-o-boy was playing this a while back.
Damn, the memes are true
Ripe old age of 30 plus
Jumpscares aren't being scared though.  Being startled is not being scared.
bro got nerfed😭
When you hit 30. You start feeling your mortality
Jumpscares just annoy me. Anyone can say "BOO!" and scare people. But real fear... real terror... that takes a lot of talent to create.
Vindication
It's funny that a single glass break and a jitter of reaction is enough to warrant a video
Should know after all those years 😂
Is Charlie becoming...human?
Never thought I’d see the day a Charlie video would have this title.
HES A REAL BOY
man hits 31 and becomes a wimp
In one year Charlie turns 32 I think that’s when he’ll learn empathy as most people learn that at that age
Yea your new channel is great gotta say been loving your return to your roots in a way and has been fun to throw you on in the background since they are so long and love that you don't edit much too!
Man discovers fear for the first time
Hey you should try out Combat Master, it's a lot of fun
Comments is just teenagers making gets 31 jokes guys come on😅😅
this building is haunted? thats just how most buildings look in china. i see nothing wrong
I really like these game highlights  Please do more! "I like these highlights and I want you to do more of them button" V
Dawgs getting old 🥀
Aging is everybodies Kryptonite🥔
0:58  why does that guy in the door look alot like Charlie if he was older
I want to believe that creative people are just getting better at making jumpscare
John Wolfe is the GOAT of not flinching at horror games
Where is the part when he gets jumpscared
Hits 30 and has to remind himself everyday that he’s 30
Charles.... stop shoving in too hard.... please.... 😭😢😭😫😩
Ok I was thinking it was going to be to the same level as the werewolf lol. His mouse did a little shake but the werewolf one was worse
The after 30 debuffs are real.
Dude it’s just a loud noise, that can startle anyone. Jumpscares are dumb and annoying.
Na it’s worse when you know the jumpscare is coming you mentally prepare for it and they still get you 😂
Go visit the Warren's house, or go try you luck with the Annabelle doll, then reevaluate your beliefs.
Here's the thing, you're probably not focusing on keeping up that stoic face all the time, or at least not as worried about it as you used to be. When you just relax and actually try to enjoy a game, or show, or anything else, it tends to be more immersive. I used to be the same way till I became more comfortable being myself.
Bro finally turned the volume up lmao
Charlie turned 30 and achieved Unc status
"I got actually scared. Like a legit jumpscare, like I sat on a whoopee cushion." 😂 Dude I love your sense of humor, never change man. 😅
I honestly believe Charlie wasn't getting jumped scared because he keeps the audio to the games he plays so damn soft
It's okay unc❤
"that sounds like perverts", Epstein is that you!?!?
turning 30 the gas starts going down
time is getting to bro once hes 70 and playing games hes gonna get scared by a fucking rat
Of all the bad news of 2025, this is the worst
Bruh just hit 30 today myself and I'm ready for my knees to blow out like a pair of airbags
To be fair, ive never been jumpy either, but the OG jumpscare in jason got me good. Since turning 30 and that moment i hate scary movies.
Desensitized
yo
Charlie finally developed survival instinct at the ripe age of 30
The only surprising thing here is that that game didn't have you clean the floor or throwing out the trash
3:20 got Tf2's Miss Pauling up in there
1 more year and he’ll unlock empathy and join idubbz😔😔
how come these games never have death animations, its always putting a face on your screen when you die
mf 31 looking 41.
It happens to all of us after 30.
I think Charlie should play a game where cockroaches just chase and growl at him
Now try to play like it should be played: with headphones, and not just one earphone in 😂😂😂
Can’t wait for the meatcanyon video on Charlie losing his powers
I guess Charlie’s kryptonite is turning 31 crazy work
SET ME BACK TO WUMBO!
Turning 31 was Charlie's cannon event
5:23 bruh you cant get shorter
Imagine if Charlie played with headphones. Would be jumpscare mania
4:47 old age has penetrated
The jewels on Charlies vagazzle have all fallen off.
Jumpscares/ noises/ events at 4:49 5:30 7:35 7:47 8:34 9:25 10:17 10:40 11:10 12:24 13:43 15:01 16:02 17:04 18:51 21:48
Not gonna lie, horror games are getting actually scary, especially the indie ones. They are evolving and improving really fast.
I wonder if I am right, you are less scared when you are physically strong, you will be more scared when getting old, I wonder how scared a women feels
turns 31 and jumpscares get fixed
Homie is learning to immerse himself.
4:53 "that one startled me" (face unflinching did not blink, clenched butthole, barely moved, said "woah") 🤣
no man can hold that power forever
Turned 31 and is slowly developing Pussitis
1:32 the fact Charlie doesn’t believe the paranormal exists but **wants to prove it does**???  I uh, I like that perspective! 😊 it’s just surprises me 😅
Doesn't get jumpscared if you are wondering
nice style dude
Can't wait until cockroaches don't scare Charlie anymore
Just play Minecraft, and get hit by a skeleton's stray arrow when you're not looking.
Charly finally unlocked the fear feature!
Yipppeeeee
Charlie's transformation has begun. He is unlocking his spiritual limiters, his connection to the cosmic threads is awakening. He is becoming acutely aware of the weakness of flesh. What appears to the untrained observer as decay, is actually rapid evolution. He has begun to ascend.
I’m so sorry to hear you have contracted formidulosis morbis (jump scare disease). It claims another victim.
Aww I love that you’re acknowledging it haha!! It’s been so frickin exciting seeing the jump scares get you a bit on this new channel! Although you barely jump still, I hope it continues to trend this way lol
Don't worry Charlie, We don't think less of you. Sometimes the jump comes from the annoying noise and not an actual startle. I know I quickly reach for my headphones and stuff because they use super loud sounds for the jumpscares.
I need feedback on my pesticide application.
Charlie I need feedback on my pesticide application
Alternative video title: "Old man scared by videogame"
Are you going to cover the One Giant Onion situation?
You need to replay P.T next
47 year old man discovers fear
This nerf is crazy
If you want my armchair psychology perspective, it might honestly be because you've been much happier lately. When I'm depressed nothing gets through. But when I'm happy, grounded, and more internally present, I can be a bit of a jumpy fuck
Imagine you played with lights off
Bro doesn't even have a link to his gaming channel in the description and I am too lazy to search for it.
I feel like the horror genre went downhill so badly, back when it was popular when PewDiePie played it, it used to have way more immersive gameplay now it's just watered down to this level of "immersion" you'd think with current day budgets things would've been epic but rather it seems to be the opposite.
MCQUEEN IS FADING!
3:08 The real demons in this place are the pathogens we picked up along the way
So the nerfs finally got him
I think what really manages to make you scared by the game itself is the atmosphere and story, you were so invested into it that you immersed yourself so bad you were crouch walking thinking the grandma would hear you turns out she could never hear you running.  Maybe Chinese horror games are just good at playing with your mind.
Getting a bit up there, huh Mr white?
Finally about time for him to act like a human
yall comment glue if you hate these flippin bots
It’s the age, same happened with me. Also can’t do roller coasters anymore either :(
You're just getting old Charlie 😭
I feel like theyve really perfected them in recent times. Like, they know we're desensitized to them and went into the science of what make us do that and dialed it in until they got really good at misdirecting us and then then doing the jumpscare at the perfect time. Atleast, thats what I assume. But I think him getting startled actually makes for great content
Yep. We unc
I was literally thinking this a few hours ago. The ones on the FB reels are the ones that get me the most tho.
You're gettin weak in your age, old man
this is just charlie finally realizing that all the years of jump scare immunity that provided much content can now be flipped to either "things are scarier now" or "im losing my powers" for more value after that "finally jumpscared" vid, and im allll for it lmao
Not so Young wild and free lol closer we get scarier things seem 😅😅 30 and older gets it 😢
Wait til you almost fall on your ass 😅😅😅
bro turned 30 and it'll happen to all of you muahahaha
I know what all the comments on this video are gonna be 😂
I'd love to see Charlie spend a night alone in one of the most haunted places.
Bros on the battle stage
you should replay some older horror games to see if its the new games that are scary, or its you that started getting jumpscared
The devs in Japan cook up some amazingly horrifying experiences. Believe it or not Fortnite actually has a good amount of these devs cooking up some pretty decent games in the community games category.
17:14 actually, that type of posture would be related to kyphosis, not scoliosis ☝️🤓
I like how now every comment has something to do about Charlie turning 31
Jumpscare at 0:00
The elderly gamer.
Charlie is slowly descending from Godhood, bro is becoming Human more and more
I think he should use a nightvision camera if he is going to play in the dark
friend of mine who loves horror who is also largely unphased by jump scares once told me that she realized that she could get jumpscared if she let herself be more immersed into the game, its possible this new wave of horror games charlie has been experiencing have gotten him a lil more immersed especially since he's playing them off stream, and stream can be a detriment to immersion.  that or he's just old and scaredy now who knows. welcome to the geriatric club old man.
This is like when All Mights powers began fading away
mfs be hitting 30 and becoming aware of their own impending death
Dude finally unlocked emotions at 31
Real ones remember the wasp incident
Literally everyone I’ve seen talk about Dread Flats has given it true praise and actually said it was alarming and scary. It’s so good, please check it out!
Mf hits 31 and de-integrates his shadow self
You should try alien isolation  And also...   Hay Mr Charly, your talk about your sleep disorder has led to me remember a manga I haven't red in a while but remember quite fondly enough to recommend.   it's called "Insomnia after school" a cute love story about a high school boy struggling with insomnia after his mom abandoned him while he was asleep from a young age, ever since it's been a problem until he met a girl sleeping in the school's Astronomy club's observatory  There he found she had the same disorder and both started to take afternoon naps there but in order to continue they actually needed to keep the club going By this and that, they started Astronomy club once again with the advantage of wondering through the night and taking pictures of the beauty which holds many stars we miss while we're asleep
that 31st birthday changed EVERYTHING
Charlie did you play silent still 2?
31 year old man still gets jumpscared the old fashioned way
0:34 the ability to what 🤨😩
You’re officially unc mister Charles
whats going on homie ya getting more stressed? I used to get jumpscared by things not as much anymore. except in multiplayer games that arent meant to be scary hahhahah. that mf sneaking up to you in siege is terrifying
My guess is that your getting jump scared more frequently because you don't have a live audience??
Ah imagine if you had actually been startled while playing FNaF instead of talking about accidentally pissing all over a nice girl i never would have become interested
The day has finally come…
Jump scares are what hack writers do when they don’t know how to actually scare you…
Age is hitting different for Charles
Charlie there's this horror game called Skull Hotel on Steam, I think the game does a really good job at building up tension, and think it would be worth you playing.
how do jumpscares still work on people?
Bro the title should be. "Being Penetrated Traumatized me"
Scariest thing in that game is the head bob, game character must be severely drunk.
You are becoming a sissy my friend
It’s just basic insominomics
his Wolverine powers are running out, we had a good run guys
yess finally, the Jesus character was too overpowered. The nerf was long overdue
Unc starting to get soft 😢
So this is what it's like to hit 30 huh even charlie cannot stop its after effects
This thumbnail needed a red circle
Oh god, he's already started questioning his immortality. He discovered fear
Charlie may have lost his jumpscare immunity, but at least he can still play through the games mortals dread playing.
Banger vid
its probably because horror games become so boring that you put your mind at a place where you can feel it, happens to me now
Charlie is losing his power!
Time is nigh ol' man.
After 30 everything accelerates.
Never thought there'd be jumpscares in here. Holy sh*t
Bros stoicism is aging too
Rewatch hereditary now
Can we get predator concrete jungle?
Charlie hit 31 and is realizing Jesus died at 33
New fear unlocked
I don’t get it. So it’s the weak jump scares that no one flinches at that gets him?? That’s crazy
Just wait until he’s 40
I haven't played a game in 18 years. Watching this makes me want to start😅
No way! You actually played in the dark! the meta is working obviously lolol otw to watch the full play through
Bro lost his superpowers after hitting 31
dude hit 31 and began to feel shivers running down his spine
charlie when he learns about welcome to the game II
This is like Spider-Man 2 when Peter starts losing his powers
Ah yes the heartattack debuff. I learned about this one at universal studios during their Halloween event.
I think it's different when you have an audience. The sense of community reduces the fear factor.
Human after all.
The jumpscarer became the jumpscaree
I have that same immunity to horror games and jumpscares and similar phenomenon that you are losing by each passing day moist... For anyone that knows a game that could get me please let me know I would love playing it and crediting you as the one who finally got me.
u should cover the yoel romero stabbing
Maybe because he's playing it off stream so he actually feels alone
dear god even charlie's getting flanderized
he can bleed
you’re getting old, Charlie
Ahhhh!! Watch out for that scary woman that's wading through the shallow end of an invisible pool!
He hit 31 and he’s breaking down in his old age
He’s like when gaara first bled
If I don't think I'm gonna get jumpscared I don't get jumpscared. If I think I'm gonna get jumpscared I get jumpscared
Hit 30, got penetrated
No chat to save you, just you and pure terror
but is the game really that good, or is he just scoring it higher in his mind because hes not immune to jumpscares anymore?
If you dare, you should try "Schwein gehabt". Was released yesterday in the Fortnite launcher and was developed by Sparkasse - a public German savings Bank. It's a first person horror game and you are a piggy bank fleeing from the child that owns the piggy bank and wants to kill it for the money.
lets cross the street grandpa
Bro hit 31 and gained fear
Yo Charlie, I know you are allergic to paranormal stuff but this one is straight from rural Mexico and it has haunted my brain for years.  Picture this. I am at my grandma’s place in Oaxaca, literally the last house before the cornfields and darkness eat the road. It is hot, I cannot sleep, so I am outside at like 2 a.m. scrolling my phone. Then I hear it. A baby crying. But it is not “aww, baby” crying. It is “something is trying way too hard to sound like a baby” crying. My grandma bursts out the door and says, “Inside. Now.” (in spanish) She tells me it is a bruja. Not the Halloween kind. The Mexican kind. They shapeshift into owls or turn into bolas de fuego, balls of fire, and fly around at night. My mom actually grew up here and swears she used to see those glowing orbs as a kid. She said they would float low over the fields or zip through trees like someone yeeted a lantern across the sky. Everyone knows you do not follow them. Of course, I stayed by the window. That is when I saw it. Something gliding over the corn. Too big to be an owl, glowing orange like it was made of hot coals. I hit it with my flashlight and it just rotated in midair and blasted straight up into the sky. Next morning, right where I saw it, there were barefoot human footprints in the middle of the field. No tracks leading in or out. Then in 2022, I went back. I thought I was grown and unshakable. First two nights were fine. Third night, that baby cry came again. I did not even check. Closed the curtains, turned on Netflix, prayed it could not get through Wi-Fi. People there still say witches take off their legs, turn into fireballs, and go hunting for newborns. The crying is their bait. My grandma still hangs scissors in an X over cribs to keep them away. Do I fully believe it? No. But do I sit outside alone at night in Oaxaca anymore? Absolutely not. If you want to go down a rabbit hole, search brujas de México bolas de fuego or lechuzas brujas Oaxaca. It is all there.
I was hoping the big "jump scare" in the game would be that nude doctor from Arkansas! 👍  Sidenote a tiny lizard 🦎ran out onto my computer desk while I was watching this! 😨Sadly, not a jump scare - I live in Georgia and lizards run into my house occasionally when I open the back door.  Also, I knew something (generally a spider or tiny tree frog) was hiding behind my computer desk, because one of my cats was staring into that area  earlier this morning - but she couldn't reach her paws far enough behind the desk to grab it. The lizard finally figured "the coast was clear" and ventured out from its hiding spot. I caught it and put it back outside. If the nude doctor from Arkansas suddenly breached my back door (get your minds out of the gutter!) that would have ensured a legit jump scare.
Taxes taxes politics something about Ukraine war and uhhh donald trump (Ignore this lol)
Crazy conspiracy theory: Charlie never came back after season 1. Season 2 has been nothing but AI. don’t believe me? Check out all the “oh I’m old” statements that are nothing but cover for the AI mistakes that real Charlie would never made…cmon people it’s right in front of you. Black tshirts?????? Really???
His defenses are failing
That fact that you referred to yourself as old gave me a jump scare.
Bro hit 30 and became Arthur Morgan.
are you going to talk about the alien mother ship that everyone is talking about?
31 is hitting this man hard. Also play saints row 1 and 2
He finally developed *Fear.*
I watch Charlie play horror games because if he doesn’t get scared neither do I, but now I’m continuously spooked every single time he uploads. He gave me passive immunity to fear.
The cracks are beginning to show. Once his defenses were infiltrated, the floodgates will now open
Got to 30 and started experiencing basic human emotion
Probably more scared without a bunch of live viewers watching just alone in his room
What’s next? You’re no longer afraid of Cockroaches?
31 and he's already starting to go senile
every game except ultrakill ):
Red circles are great and all, but they're inferior to red triangles 🔻
17:05 why they kinda…
Dude.. me too.  As a kid and young man, no issues. No content phased me. Now? I'm in my 40's and I can't even play Resident Evil games. It's not that they're scary, its the dread and anxiety that horror games build.
Play dredge!
the age of 30 starts to scare me
where tf is the jumpscare
“She’s addicted to television!”
Aha-haha-ha, you're getting old man, i'm not scared of *dread flaps* and neither by *whose at the door* bc they're just not scary to me.
He's finally putting his shield down, if you play horror games and don't take them seriously then your never gonna get scared. If you let yourself get immersed your gonna get scared
Sounds like you had depression and now it's gone. Same reason you're enjoying games again.
So at 31shit gets wierd
His brain was only developing a fear factor in his brain his whole life and it finally finished
That's your body telling you to get a prostrate exam. It's trying to scare you... cause you're old now. I joined the 31 club In July. Guess I should be concerned too.
And that's playing with only one earbud, imagine with two. 😂
I remember when you did it lol
I don't wanna be 30 omfg
The curse of turning 31
Maybes our 30s is the dark soul after all
0:54 “Sir, a second jumpscare has hit Charlie”
Make a vid about David uploads. It’s actually crazy what he does.
I'm the opposite, I'm now becoming immune to jump scares
"It's a generous burglar. It's a chef!" 😂😂
Thought it said Jamaicans started to scare me at first lmao
Yeah I also feel like you've hit 31 and have become more cheerful, it's really sweet :)
"Hit 31" comments becoming a virus lmao
Paranoia and stress compound as you get older and you tend to actually worry about things when you actually realize that you are not, in fact, invincible🤣
In the future, horror games will be rated on how many old gamers it unalives.
your getting old
can you yalk about roblox prostecting pdf files and getting sued by the goverment
This actually happens with age, it’s pretty common. If you look at other gamers when they were younger versus 30 plus, they get scared more often the older they get.
This is like kenpachi zaraki weakening himself
Need the Jedi Knight series soon!!!! Would love to see you play through Outcast/academy. Plus there is the remaster of Dark Forces 1
Charlie’s not yet recognizing that he’s entering prime fatherhood stage where a stank diaper will give any man a fright! I think he’d be a fair enough dad – he’s gotta work on his icky germs phobia.
why is everything fucking italic?
Time as always forgives none.
The slamming of the table in miside got me xD
Believe it or not that extremely small list to successfully jumpscare Charlie includes Batman Arkham Knight 😂
I'm pretty Sure Charly is manipulating us to shill his Gaming Channel. Just a hunch.
MoistCr1TiKaL Gaming is run by a fake Charlie that gets jumpscared...but it still slaps
You nasty ass burping every 10 minutes. I drink a ton of beer every day and don’t burp like that. wtf is wrong with your stomach
Charlie acting like he is Kratos or sm
You gotta replay games you previously thought weren't scary to see if they scare you now. This must be studied.
Indeed. Back in the day, we all felt dead inside due to our unfettered access to the internet. Jumpscares really don't phase you too much after watching hours of the worst videos the web had to offer.
jesus has learned the meaning of fear
Based on the personal experience of a friend, this is a signal that you’ll be crying in sad death scenes by 60.
oh i thought moistcritikal gaming was someone uploading clips
I think my first time seeing him get a little jumpscare was when he was playing a game with Seereax on his Month of Mayhem. It was about a Lunch Lady and she caught him off guard. 😂
This is actually normal.  Your willpower decays over time.  You don't realize how many things were "Autopilot" in your youth until you get older.  This is fixable though.  It means you have to retrain your brain or actively understand it now must acknowledge the thing it used to do automatically, but now manually get better at it.
Lidet
The two times you got startle was both with a loud noise of glass breaking, so I don't believe it's a age thing, i believe it's you who aren't accustomed to the sound of glass loudly breaking suddenly.
0:36 yo what the hell
We can't lose you, Moist.
Charlie mate, avoiding mold and germs is the worst thing you can do for yourself. Your immune system must be weak as hell.
Are jump scares really scary or are they just startling? Something that is truly scary leaves a lasting impression. It gives you nightmares. Jump scares get you for a moment but then it passes. And with movies or games that rely heavily on jump scares, you get numb to it after a while.
so that’s why you haven’t paid Luto yet! i knew you were a scaredy cat
What game is this? The animations look great
Paid actor
Video about Roblox Louisiana lawsuit when?
Their are new karen videos.
0:36 Ayo?
nahh ur bitched out now noooooo 😭🙏
yeah it's tough getting old.
What if you are getting startled because you're playing games offline, for example what if because you play games on stream you subconsciously think your chat is there and you lose the "fear" factor from a game but since youre playing off stream you finally think youre alone playing the horror games so you are more susceptible to scares in the game but thats just me guessing lol
Damn gramps
Dude, if you’re playing every game, there is could you please play the little nightmares series!  I would love to watch you play that .
If I made a game that startled Charles, thats it, thats the peak. You're never going to achieve more than that, but you can rest easy and proud knowing you did the semi-impossible.
Even Gods can bleed.
Maxwell is being given a work release
With age, Charlie's powers dwindle
I love how this channel just plays what he wants.  Then you have people like jev who care whats popular and what's people are playing . And tim lol . Only a few channels
Charlie having his Cars 3 moment
The content creating instincts are taking over, you must react
6:00 the second mistake
yo whats good guys welcome back to another paranormal video follow me into this mansion alright so ima set up this camera here and do a little timelapse while i take a nap let me know if anything happens
Hey migo. 40 here. It gets worse. Everything does.
32 year old charlie will actually scream when playing horror games
okay bruh but jumpscares have never been scary, barring playing fnaf one at like age 11
I love how he hits 31 and starts getting nerfed instantly. Also i would love to think the supernatural is real, but if it was it would be 100% tested and used in some capacity by the goverment
Lucky ahh man, you got 30 years. I got 2 😭
Bro's ice-cold heart is starting to thaw.
The Charlie situation is crazy
Charles become human
31 year old man responds to fear the old fashioned way
Click bait 🤣
What the hell is going on.  - black shirt - experiences joy - experiences fear What else am I missing?
Maybe when Charlie hits 40, he’ll start feeling some other emotions too
You best start believing in jumpscares, Charlie. You're in one.
Bro, that game was (like every other chinese walking simulator asset flip "horror" games) was ASS. It was lame, boring and the exact same thing than all these games.
I remember when I turn 31. You aren't going to like getting dentures. 😅
I’m sorry for your loss
30 years old and never played queen of mortholme. Get a load of this guy.  Day 80-something of asking Charles White to play queen of mortholme.
the second this man turned 30, he immediately got the long term nerfs. jumpscares affect him now, he has started a book club, and hes even developed back pain. how tf did your body debuff in this little of time charlie.
Crazy this is how I learn he has a gaming channel lmao
He was immune because he just never cared and had the "this is just a game" attitude, i can go without being scared by a movie if I'm cracking jokes the whole time and not get invested, he's probably just getting into the games finally.
Is moist critical in a relationship?
poopoo
Uncle Charlie
I’m glad it’ll make scary playthroughs more entertaining
I like these videos cuz I would NEVER play these games by myself 😅 and Charlie makes them funny lol
Drugs, Sex, and Rock and Roll
All the comments are about turning 31 years old. Save your time.
imagine at 32 he says he is starting to feel shame and deletes his embarrassing story videos
Welcome to the 30+ club! remember don't trust every fart anymore....
It's definitely because you are playing them off-stream and so as a result are more immersed. Pretty much how you are supposed to play those games.
The only time "jumscares" ever got me was in fallout new vegas of all things, and thats only because I'd be running through a vault grabbing everything, kill everyone, id run around a corner while thinking about what vault im hitting next and run face first into a ghoul or knightkin.
Insert lame 31 year old joke here
Maybe horror games can finally be fun to play for him.

“And they shall know no fear”  Well, that aged like human.
He’s losing his immortality that means he can be defeated in battle
And lets not forget the infamous claw machine jumpscares 😂
-plays horror game -gets mad after getting scared
I haven’t played video games in awhile, this shi looks real asf
Did he play Roblox again or something?
Sir another spooky scary jumpscare has hit the Charles
Say cheese urger
Why do I never get jumpscared?
Past 30 and bro is falling apart 😂hang in there my mans
Where is Charlie and what did you do with him??
The RE remakes get me good sometimes, especially RE2.
Bro has been jumpscared by hit cat. What is he on about.
Congrats to idubbz and charlie for unlocking human emotions in ther 30s
i goon to your videos.
Florida Man discovers fear at age 31.
thank god i age backwards
Turned 31 then got nerfed 💀
Can you play Deep Rock Galatic?
Hey Charlie, it's hard to watch 10 hr highlights on the gaming channel sometimes, so I'd appreciate it if you made videos like these a bit more often.
Never thought we’d see the day this title grazes a penguinz0 video
Bunghole is getting more loose maybe that's why 🤔
People in their 30s are the worst. They are still kids but keep complaining they are so old, probably because they have a hard time watching their 20s moving away in the rear mirror. Fortunately, this insufferable phase passes for most after 40.
same thing with me i used to be immune to that shit, now even the slightest loud sound scares me
Charlie at 31 entering his spider man 2 faze losing his superpowers
I remember when I was a kid and I was scared, I talk out loud all the time to make myself look brave like Charlie does in this video. Maybe that is his secret.😂
I definitely think it's because of the lack of chat's presence. Now that you are playing more games off stream, the feeling of isolation that most horror games attempt to capture is probably having an effect. You don't have the goofy list of funny people saying wacky things to break your immersion.
debuff
Got to say Charlie, since you started wearing different color shirts things started to happen. You should considered going back plain white shirts before it gets ugly.
We all know that the only thing that can startle Charlie…    AI!!!
It's because of your decreased sleep bro.
Florida man unlocks fear after turning 31
We get it man.  You're 31 omg so old!
some people unlock empathy and some unlock fear
This is insane
It's all over. Charlie not having a stone cold face when there is a jumpscare is like a dinosaur not having tiny arms, it's sad.
Wear two of your headphones you'll get twice as much startled
you need to stop playing horror games grandpa. it's bad for your heart
He is becoming human, the lizard is finally adapting to becoming human. I know what you are Charlie, the age excuse is................... just an excuse.
The scariest part of this game is that sickness inducing fov
6:48 let's get at her
Could it be that streaming makes you less scared?
bros subscription ended
He's feeling like an old man at 31, and now realizes just how frail his body on this mortal coil really is.
That 31 is hitting harder than he thought.
It’s nice to know Im not the only one. I’m 32 now and I also can’t watch or play scary movies alone anymore. I genuinely get startled by them. Now looking back it started after I turned 30. Used to love all that stuff when I was growing up.
I firmly believe that if you play games alone and not livestreaming them that it drastically increases the immersion. Even if your someone that has the chat not on screen and never reads the chat.
0:10 “complete” immunity? Are we forgetting a certain crappy game from a while back?
Man, entering your 30s seems like such a huge debuff
Hahahahahahh mwahah
This is for sure one of the signs of the apocalypse, Charlie unlocking fear. Have mercy on us.
Getting startled is actually a good thing, Charlie. Imagine someone jumping out from behind a tree swinging an axe and you try to Chad stare it down.
5:22 ptsd moment
well, the grim reaper is not that far from you, you should fear
MCQUEEN IS FADING FAST 💔💔💔💔💔💔
Its crazy how your mental changes rapidly as you get older. I suddenly developed severe anxiety when i turned 30 that got so bad i couldnt breathe. I didnt even know it was anxiety until a dr told me.
Damn im only a few months away from turning 31 myself. I'm curious and worried about how my life will completely change 😂
Does hitting 30 year old enabled your feelings and humanity???,
31 year old man feels fear for first time
Old man damn
Bro was just stacking skill points till now
thank god, finally 🔴📎
31 and Unc's reaction time just ain't what it used to be. Startled and discombobulated.Dazed, reeling and about to break.
As I get older I find that I do get more emotional
Is there multiple endings? I swear I didn't get to do half that stuff 😂 damn should replay
31 yr old man scares easily
tbf, getting scared is more fun during these type of games
Time for all the repetitive turned 30 jokes in the comments
Charlie burped so many times in this video my hair are rizzed in the air from the force of it
Fear of jump scares unlocked at level 31
Bro grew up 😂😂
his power is draining. The woes of aging
31 year old man on the brink of death caused by fear
Moist critikal gaming is one of the best things Charlie has done in a while. And it's literally just Charlie playing games without chat.
roblox is getting sued!
Charlie be careful, your heart isn't what it used to be a week and a half ago 🥺
Wait til bro turns 35. He'll be crying over a movie moment.
its called 31 syndrome
This is like an old man starting to realize he can suffer from a heart attack at any moment
His immunities are running out
Yup, you’re 31’s will do that to you
Charlie discovered fear the same way idubbbz discovered empathy.
You should play Phasomphobia in VR and do some maps solo at night.
The end of an era
Turned 30 and got the yips
Wait till he hits 32 and learns empathy
31 years to get nerfed is crazy
Just wait until you’re old enough they start hurting your back.
Wolverine losing healing factor ahh situation
"Men don't cry because they are weak, they cry because they've been strong for too long" ahh type situation.
kyphosis not scoliosis
10:41 even hank hill was frightened
Getting startled by jumpscares is crazy
680 comments and no sight of isabella yet. Never been this early.
Hey as long as you don't have to look for batteries for your flashlight sound cool
Anyone in 2025?
Charlie turns 31 and started actually playing horror games with volume and finally figured out jumpscares in general
Put some lotion on, Charlie. I can hear your dry skin when you were scratching.
Players should understand these things avoidable if they used the tools given.
it's the age charlie..
31 situation is crazy
Darkwood next??
I wouldnt call a light bulb breaking a jumpscare.
A second scare has hit the Chalies
Honestly, I get it. Things that never worried me or scared me have now started to. Thirties is a weird time 🙃
if he sees another roach at his age it's going to take him out
you're getting old unc (ly tho)
the pictures gave me a flashback to a picture i once took on my 3DS that had what looked like a person falling in the background through a open door
Praise god✝️
Sorry, you can't bait me in like that. Good try.
Obsessed with the gaming channel, one of my fav pastimes.
Play fnaf 4 if its true then
lets not forget that he was scared of one missed call when he was a kid, like terrified.
Finally
"Ohhh my poor old heart"
the gaming channel has reminded me how much i love oldschool lets plays of random indie games. just put it on when reading or playing roguelites and its a banger
Much scare such wow
by next year Charlie's going to need assistance while crossing the street
You grew out of it early, Charlie. It started hitting me at 40. I will never forget feeling the quick heart jump, and it was in the introduction of Man Bat in Arkham City. Ever since I rarely don't get that quick "falling fast" feeling when something jumps out in a movie or game.
I think there's something to this. I'm 35 and when I was about 30/31 things started to affect me more. More anxiety during horror movies, less of desire to do dangerous things like skydive, outdoor rock climbing...more of a physical effect from empathy like I used to watch horrible videos and not feel much of anything but now a beheading video would ruin the rest of my day. Like I feel sad and physically ill. I used to wonder what was happening with people that would have those reactions to things and now I know firsthand lol. Idk, a sample size of two might not exactly be a scientific study but maybe there's something to aging that does this to people.
a cockroach jumpscare might send this man into intensive care
You can always go this way or that way. It's how reality works.
"What's up everybody it's Critical" "Well that's the end of the video, remember to rate the video, comment the video and subscribe if you want to see videos similar to this one, see ya"
Charlie's burps are the worst jumpscares, ngl
Gotta learn that immunity
That’s not the only thing that happens when you turn 30 brotha…
Thank you YouTube for dealing with the bot problem……very nice🙄
nah even I in my 20s get startled when my family drops a plate, I wouldn't worry about that being a 30+ year old problem
31 old 5'6ft man from florida experiences fear for the first time
Please play Alien Isolation
11:56 "I"m assuming i dont want to get touched"-charlie
unlocked fear at 31 like a dlc expansion
Back in the beginning of youtube it was rampant with jump scare videos. A very terrifying and humbling time.
i read your title on the comment sec of that horrir gameplay lol
Clippy would not jump-scare the elderly
oh noooo
Fear of Nightmares could startle Charlie in his prime
i unlocked that hidden ability too. for me it was due to meds i took
I’m the complete opposite so far. As a kid I was absolutely terrified of literally anything negative, ghosts, spirits, gods, etc. but I’m 23 now and I fucking love playing scary games and rarely get jump scared anymore.
new update for Charlie
I love these horror videos Charles, you've helped me through a lot
Please remember to take your heart medication, unc
He forgot that the ghost is not in the closet, and now he's mortal
i have this superpower that moist boy has lost
The future is now, old man
I'm always startled AF, can't play first person shooters at all
Mr.President, A second jump scare has hit the moist…
Its so funny.. sooooo many of us type out similar or the same comments.  Its like we're all a hive mind
I just love seeing clippy people appearing in all youtubers videos
8:36
i remember the exact moment when the ghost chick came falling thru the tv i i got so shocked i literally started to to push my laptop away from my lap as if she just broke through my screen. then i rewinded and saw the fear of god in charlies eyes. in my years of watching its the first time ive seen his soul leave his body. he was like wolverine in logan, unc just cant go on anymore
next thing you know onions are going to start making him tear up
Charlie horror content is peak
I dont feel less manly because i jump at jumpscares, a bee flies past my ear and i jump, its just a natural reaction.
👋
"It's afraid.. It's afraid!"
Unc got old 😢
Oh man i remember when he got jumpscared by that flying monster in "Cry Of Nightmares" and called it a "bottom of nutsack barrel" jumpscare
31 yr old debuff😢
Jesus fkn christ can you guys shut tf up about his age 😂 brother turned 31 and everyone turned into brain dead comedians
This has to be a sign
BOO!    Hahaha, got you!
Getting soft in your old age?
Coming from the man who has the most iron will ever towards horror stuff
Bro was so afraid of turning older it switched him permanently
you got me with the "ability to penetrate me" line Charlie, we not 50 yet damn it 🤣🤣
I'm 37 so I'm at death's door now
why is 6 afraid of 7? 6 isn't afraid of 7. not after realizing what 31 does.
0:44 that game was not a banger by any means, it was def the first sign of your jumpscare defenses deteriorating but you praised it for not know what you do now
first u all suck
Someone needs to analyze each scare that gets him and fine toon a game specifically to scare Charlie lol.
I also started to change with a thing I was proud of, I used to never be grossed out by stuff and now it's so easy
Now all I want is a compilation of jump scares with Charlie
Welcome to my world
Deadcam... 10/10 indie game... Play it
Bro's Stats isn't within requirements for Jumpscare Immunity Passive anymore
Wittle baby got scared from wittle glass
carefull there old man
Wait until we see 32
Old man problems
31 is really hitting Charlie hard
So even gods can bleed…
were not forgetting about fear of nightmares madness descent
The miss swan reference is top tier.
What if your limbic system was just so laggy that by the time your brain registered the scare, your body figured it's been there the whole time 🤔
Never thought I'd see the day
Season 4 Charlie loosing all his buffs rn.
Me 2
Sometime between age 29-31 everyone must face their Saturn Return... 🪞😱😂
brother metamorphosized into a new charles like doctor who. new personality and errythang
Charlie you have to play AMENTI next 🙏
Living life in NG+ now
We all knew this video was coming 😂😂
Brother unlocked emotions dlc at the age of 31
Bro turned 31 and started feeling fear again
That thumbnail is amazing
Playing horror games on stream makes them 10x less scary because you literally have a chat of thousands of people with you all the time, playing them off stream I think is a blessing for you, even the shitty ones
The man started fearing things since he passed 30, he’s becoming a Vietnam grandpa
The dirty state of the rooms themselves astounds me. Ugh!
4:48 a broken light starts to weaken Charlie’s sand armor.
Ive been on the toilet for 3 hours now. I was hoping this would push the shit out of me but no luck. Still sweating loosing   leg function
PenguinzO is getting old, bros...
i wonder which new feeling Charlie will unlock at 32
Dude hit 31 and is about to hit 32
I thought he really got startle by a ghost or smth, not a random sound
Better not turn 32
The judge is called Oscar Del Fabbro. Add him to the list of people to arrest when the civil war kicks off.
bro reached 30 n got massive nerfs :')
I would never spend any nights in a haunted anything.
Unc turns 31 and forced to unlock new DLCs
*hand against Charlie's head*  "IT'S AFRAID!" *Thunderous Applause*
Jump scares piss me off
Yeah, 31 is frightfully old to this 68 year old!
Running ads I see.
Bro I jumped
What hitting 30 does to a man
We're witnessing the defeat of Kronos now
its like 30 and up its going away
Achievement unlocked
every time your video starts, I get a jumpscare
Maybe you should do a another haunting video and maybe you'll get lucky since you're 31 now
4:46 jump scare warning!
"At 31 charlie has discovered fear" Didn't this guy freak out over a tiny wasp and flee the room like a scooby doo character
Sooner or later he'll start screaming like the time he saw a cockroach
This is most unexcepted Charlie
And for the longest time, the only thing that could startle Facebook Jesus was Fear of Nightmares. Turning 30 really is the the turning point for alot of people, the defenses start to wain. And for Charlie, the defense against fear is cracking.
It’s probably because you don’t stream when you play these games on your channel perhaps it’s because your alone
idk whats the deal with 30 year olds saying they feel old...30yo is PEAK age of male performance...yall are tweaking.
lil bro reaching unc status 💔
My guy took 30 years to develop his amygdala
The buff finally ran out
the body finally realizes that after 30 you are more vulnerable, so it allows you to feel fear again
His moist skills are drying out.
charlie is now compromised.
*NEW ENEMY UNLOCKED* ahh 🥀
I kinda know what that immunity feels like. The jumpscare would startle me, but i would not give a reaction, so for anyone watching me i didn't get scared. Nowadays tho i don't think i can still do it
31 makes him a pussy, huh
He acts all stoic but actually has violent nightmares about every game he plays and pees his little boy pants in his little boy bed every night
Its time to pass on the torch, Charlie, and to train your successor that will fight against the horror.
Charlie’s hit unc status 😭
Unc arc
BOO!! how did I do?
I like this new Old Man Moist arc
0:36 The ability to WHAT?!?!!
Dude unlocked Fear, next unlock is a man out of time when he reaches 40 and starts acting like an Unc
So the game is just Room 1408. Stephen King did it first. I wonder how the devs were able to publish this. CCP bans talking about ghosts or the afterlife (yes, this makes horror movies very boring).
with how it's going next year he unlocking wheelchairs and heart attacks
Wait until you hit 32. A simple sound will make your old ass flinch.  35 its over.
some people are scared of turning 31, this man is scared first time at 31
I like how when he turns off the lights all I can see is the white t shirt
whaddya call reverse desensitization
Watching you get startled was scarier than the jumpscare
I’m glad Charlie is getting to enjoy games again
one day we will see unc scream like markiplier
God finally nerfed Charlie
Charlie's v31 Patch Notes: - Added muscle Injuries upon waking up - Fixed a bug where jumpscares don't have effect on the player - Added "Black Shirt" Clothing skin as a permanent anniversary reward  Upcoming patches & fixes - Will be adding Osteoarthritis in a future patch
If jumpscares are starting to get to him now, then cockroaches will probably make him react the same way Rose did at the end of Smile
Play the chupacabra game again
04:50 the impenetrable mans armour breaks, revealing a almost human side
that guy like 5-6 years ago in chat who said “why dont you try to EXPERIENCE a horror game for once” is feeling real vindicated rn
by 40 jumpscares will start to make charlie scream
bro turned 31 and unlocked emotion called fear
Man turned 30 and started fearing God again.
Prayed for times like these
As you get older you lose resilience.  You're not older yet.  That's 37. I'm 51.  My doorbell is fatal now.
noicE
Wait until Charlie sees the Hash-Slinging Slasher
I'm 57 and haven't played video games in 15 years but I use to sit with my sons while they played  anyway I enjoyed this 😂
i saw you had starcraft 2. play that for your gaming channel to prove you're an allrounder
This is like when Puss in Boots finally feared for his life… 8 lives in. Hope this 31 running joke lasts till he’s 40
Don’t let him make us forget the leaf jumpscare
Unc discovers fear
I just finished the worst lottery winner and Im met with a new post
Be glad, that's the whole point of it!! 👍
I'm already be jumping from scares, now I'm thinking what will happen once I hit the 30s...
Bro will no become immune to cockroaches
Why is almost every comment the exact same thing
Charlie slowly losing his power 💀
My nan is 87 and she cant get scared from horror she loves it
i never thought this day would come unc is realizing he is mortal
Unc lost his mojo
And so Charlie's downfall has commenced.
Last time I watched a charlie video he screamed at me
Florida man got the curse of age after hitting his 30's😭
take a shot for every "bro hit 30, bro hit 31...." comment  *dies from alcohol poisoning*
In a span of year he'll start to get scared as well, maybe scared of ghosts
Maybe because you play alone now and not with chat
bro unlocking fear like gaara with his "BLOOD! IT'S MY BLOOD"
OLD Man syndrome setting it lets pray
Acting like he didn't squeal like a pig every time there was a cockroach on stream lol
4:49 the moment of startle
gng the video's been out like 10 minutes how do we have over 300 comments
Jesus slowly unlocks all his emotions as he ages
The moist man get compuzzled at 4:48
unc is starting to lose his superhuman abilities
You should play more games in the dark.
Who else is hiding in the comment section right now? Lol
I have seen you jump 3 feet out of your chair when your dog touched your ankle, so how does this not surprise me? 🤫😬🫶🏻😶‍🌫️🔥🌱
His tolerance is still crazy tho, I get scared at smaller cartoonier games with friends 😭
some people gain empathy in their 30s, whilst others unlock fear in their 30s.
It can’t be
4:48 Charlie gets startled by a light breaking.
give a few more years and the empathy trait gets unlocked
Sometimes I get a bucket load of chocolate sauce in my britches from jump scares
Pease play blasphemous...
Moist critical horror game when?
Only jumpscare I know is j*b applications
Bros lost his touch
bro getting nerfed every minute
First, he unlocked emotions. Now, he has unlocked fear
he's starting to crumble. he'll be dead by 32
31 year old getting scared situation is crazy
What game is his utube avatar from Green hair man with green beard who is that,it says beef and then it cuts off what does the rest of it say,and who is blue man crying blue tears what game is that from in his profile photo.?no answer.?for 40 years? 🤔
Unsubscribed
Time is ticking, Charles. You'll be 32 next month.
Our man is getting old 😔
Dhar Mann: 31 Year Old Man Realises He Feels Fear

not a title I was ready to see
Charlies unlocking more and more emotion as he ages, cant wait to be watching once he gets dementia in his 80s, its gonna be peak 🔥🔥
every upload i'm getting more scared of becoming 31 myself
Bro turned 31 and started experiencing life to the fullest, next thing we know he's gonna be ok with flying on planes or something
He's weakening rapidly
It took him 31 years to realize scary things are scary
Huh... where are the bots?
Clippy would never scare you
scared of dino crisis huh
Got both feet in the grave
Charlie isn’t going to be prepared for the cockroach horror game
Bro got nerfed as soon as he turned 30.
fresh off the grill video
31 yo interesting number? theres 31 days in October 0_0 the spooky season!! and now hes being spooked 0-0
Make sure to take your heart meds old man ❣️
4 minutes ago is crazy
You hit 30 and did a 180, bro starts getting jumpscared and starts wearing black tees 😭
A man turned 31 years old, this is how he started getting scared.
Bro turned 31 and experienced fear all over again
the midlife crisis has hit him in an unexpected way
Im finally early
charles white
Will you make more plague seeker comics?
Games that look like this make my head hurt.
Just like that Isabella girl who is going to die soon, Charlie, too, is recognizing his own mortality.
00:35 I jump like that too when something penetrates
His heart can't keep up at his age unfortunately 😢
*charlie turns 31*  Charlie starts getting Jumpscared and started more Smiling hes becoming mortal.
You’re getting old, Charles. 31 years and you’re starting to lose your immunity to jumpscares.
Don't worry, it could just be a phase. I usually don't get startled either, but sometimes it hits me. Like, my mom once snuck up on my at a mall, but when she just appeared, I blank faced her. On the other hand, I sometimes do just get startled when I realize someone is in my room and I didn't notice.   Just wait and see
From a fellow 30 something year old, once you hit 30, you get a permanent debuff. Once you hit 40, that debuff becomes even stronger. 50 and onwards, it gets worse as the years start coming (and they don't stop coming).
I absolutely love the gaming content man I watch almost every single one
"sir the second jumpscare has hit the moist man"
Homie turned 31 and realized he can feel fear like a mortal man
No…. He's no longer fearless
Normalize jump scares
May i suggest that charlie should play the demo of THE JOY OF CREATION that is currently on steam.
GG 🫡
Bro's prime is coming to an end
Never puts name in video title,why?
It’s actually the overly loud jumpscares that get to Charlie, and now he’s misrealizing what’s happening and letting it get to him.
W vid Charlie
31 year changed a man
0:35 this is like gojo realizing that tojis dagger goes through his infinity
31 year old man feels fear the old fashioned way

Thank you Charlie for showing once you turn 31, you are doomed for fear.😊
Black shirt charlie scares me
This is a very serious debuff with the 31 patch. Im worried how much this is going to change the meta
bro hit 30 and started getting jumpscared by life
Tsk tsk
*Gets past 30* *Life turns on Nightmare mode*
Maybe give spicy sauce another shot since your tastebuds are dying of old age now
Charlie hit 31 and god realized he was too powerful and had to nerf him
Video Games and Imma1st   Don't take my comments seriously. It's only a meme
I wanna touch you, Charlie.
recession indicator
It’s a natural part of growing older, my mom was much more adventurous and daring when I was younger but is now more risk advert and startles more easily.
Hits 30 and all of his comments are annoying and the same
What's truly scary is when Charlie switches from black shirts to white then black again
People back then: I turned 30 and my bones started making noises.  People now: I turned 30 and now I get jumpscared.
life peaked for him
turning 31 has been a rollercoaster of new emotions for Charlie
Time to make games specifically to scare Charles
This old fart’s losing his thunder 💔
bro aged 10 more years after hitting 31
Took 31 years for him to start getting scared of things
