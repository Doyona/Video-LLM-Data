Bayern leverkusen will win the europa league 100%
Is West Ham even trying 😢
So it means farmers league dominate the European 😂
Alonso is going for the double.

Qarabagi hakimin hesabina kecdiler..
Fabiański ⬅️⬅️⬅️ Onana
That's a striker's goal from Boniface, looks easy, but is so difficult.
Wow, you guys showed your only shot on target... hahaha congrats
KARABAHG❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉FUCK LEVERKUSEN
Leverkusen untuk gelar kedua😂
Is the face in his name not pronounced face
Liverkusen needs man city
Mantapp
Our 2 Nigeria sons too Napoli and bayelevakuse to their first title glory in many years
Vamos Bayer Leverkusen
Bayer Leverkusen ❌ Bayer NEVERLOOSE ✅
Bayen leverwinner😂
What Xabi has squeezed out of the top 6 team, making them almost 2003/4 Arsenal is amazing and equally if not more impressive to what Mourinho did with Porto and Inter in the Champions League. I can't wait for next season to end, so Xabi can replace Ancelotti. I really hope with all my heart as a Madridista and BVB fan that Xabi wins the triplet, league is already won, the German cup final vs Kaiserslautern too, and if they don't get Liverpool (coming back from 0-3 is difficult but certainly more than possible) in the EL finals I'd say they got the win in the bag, Milan or Roma in semis can't stop them.
레버쿠젠 우승 vs 레스터시티 우승 뭐가 더 기적이냐?ㅋㅋㅋ
Leverkusen is a high-level club that cannot be compared to West Ham.
1:44 アザールなら大怪我
Whats bonifaz?
Benfica Atalanta Bayer Leverkusen Milan
History in the making
BAYER WON THE LEAGUEEE
If it wasn’t for the West Ham keeper it would have been a massive score line for Leverkusen.
Kudos to Fernando Carro and Simon Rolfes, the transfer committee, the sporting structure, the players, the coaching staff and Alonso. It shows the importance of making early, good, shrewd signings in the market.   On a lighter note, I guess you ought to have a Liverpudlian connection to topple Bayern in the race for the meisterschale😅.
Bayern Leverkusen wow amazing football the best team xabi alonso 🎉🎉🎉
Leverkusen cukup double winner aja, ecl milik Milan tahun ini ♥️🖤
Please upload extended highlights shamelessly too
David Moyes football so negative 🤦🏻
Leverkusen will be much more aggressive in the returning match.  West Ham will focus on attacking, which is what Leverkusen wishes to find more space for more goals through WH defense
West Ham, your coach sucks
Hahahah LeVARkuzenn Antony Teylor
Leverkusen is unbeaten in all 3 competitions, 42 games in a row.... Just wow.
Bayer Neverlosen motto : sometimes you are winning, sometimes others are losing...
Leverkusen , Karabag, Atalanta bu sezonun ən yaxşıları idi
Kudus should have scored that early pass. He didn't do well with that pass
It's boni"face" not "farce" but you ra☹️xist wouldn't care, would you? Whoever taught you journalism would have known that every foreigner's name has a certain pronunciation... but this is even an English name sef.... rubbish 😢
Boniface is Bad!
Boniface back with the Goals📌
33:1 shots. Not even ManCity, Arsenal etc dominated West Ham like that
Why does the highlights take so long
No disrespect meant towards West Ham, but I find it remarkable that a Premier League team that certainly has a considerably higher budget than Leverkusen and won the Conference League last year would travel to the BayArena planning on hiding in their own box for 90 minutes. It says something about the Xabi Alonso‘s and his side‘s reputation when the opponent‘s goalkeeper takes his first attempts at time play after 16 minutes.
EPL teams better try and cannablize Leverkusen's players this summer otherwise they could thrash Man City and Arsenal next year in the Champions League... although they might not get a chance because City could potentially be in the Championship or League One sometime next year due to points deduction and relegation with 115 FFP charges against them . . .
That slip😂
even the big dog club still can't beat this team, what do u expect west hamburger can do ??

Qué buenos sois carajo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
West ham should try all they can to get boniface
Bayere qarsi en ezmkar oyunu Qarabag FK gosterdi 🇦🇿
The highlights don't do justice to the amount of defending and attacking done by both teams respectively
Needed a special player Edson Alvarez
Boniface owns kudus and westham 😂
West Ham Players watch Bayer Leverkusen play from nearby😂😂 Bayer teach them how to play football 😂 Please be Ashamed of representing PL
I saw the game and I can tell everyone that West Ham is very lucky to have conceded only 2 goals. It could be much worse!
Bayer Leverkusen dominating as always! 💪⚽
Yes we lost but I think we did really well, we defended phenomenally and our game plan almost worked perfectly so I think the lads still deserve a lot of praise for what they did in this game  And tbh I still believe as well because if we create the same kinda atmosphere as we did in the Sevilla game at the LS then I really do think we've got half a chance of turning this around especially if we can score early #COYI ⚒️⚒️⚒️
next season will be horrible for this team
Чувствую Байер команда одного сезона. нет глубины состава
Fabianski was so poor
West Ham was played to smithereens. I'd loose sleep if I were the manager.
''Poland International Fabiański''  Didn't you mean - Poland EX international?
😫they’re not highlights, West Ham lost, it’s a summary or résume, but certainly not highlights 😭🙅🏻🙂⚒️
I love West Ham from Italy i hope in the London stadium Hammers Wins an go to Semifinal
Unbelievable journey for Germans
2 face👑 B2face ❤ Boniface 🦅✅🇨🇩🇳🇬
Lever ku 👑
Embarrassing performance by moyes. How arsenal lost to this guy is beyond everything.
Qarabag is better than West Ham😂
Klub Inggris do mbledosss 😂😂😂
Very powerful header💪💪💪💪💪
0:14
lol premtards
.besok leg 2, ancurin di kandang
Kudus messed up west ham chance
Leverkusen versi m.city
QARABAG😢😊
Xabi Ball Fantastic
Very poor westham
Bayern Leverkusen, smashing everyone 😅
Park bus
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Editor nice one, showing Boniface slip and doesn't show Boniface Celebration
Cowardly approach by Westham
Best celebration from Boniface 😂
If it was for goalkeeper ,we would have seen a rugby score seriously
Men against scared boys 😢
this team just defends every game
njir tisoledat haha
Boniface bone im face and turned Westham to wasteman but Kudos to kudus who kudunt do it.
Wesh ham  only had one clear chance, they got to do better at second leg
Ez
It's lowlight, not highlight...
Kudus kudunt do anything.. 😂😂😂
I'm Sorry west ham still gonna loose at home come the second leg.   I know Boniface will be fit and start then all is gonna be history 😂😂🇳🇬💪🔥
Better team won
he didn't help foden
That slip tho😂
Помогите Оренбургской области оглаской  Нужна помощь  Воды всё больше  Люди дайте огласку пожалуйста  Россия
goal leverkusen
Ok, leverkusen may of won 2-0, but tbh. West ham played better than usual.
Isnt this farmer league club...bayern m aswell....arsenal and west ham getting them in second game for sure...😮😮😂😂
Ahhhh kudus must score these goal.
Emil😂😆
Fabianski better than Buffon 🥱
Brawo Fabiański 💪🏼⚽️🇵🇱
The slip was the highlight of his celebration...great header tho, he's joining Westham in the summer😂😂
We will beat them 3-0 at home
That slip jus killed the vibe
The West Ham approach wasn't bad because they were playing against a team that has never lost this season, but not taking their chances when it came hurt them. To me, there's nothing so spectacular about Bayern 04 if other players had the same confidence as Paqueta in that match.
It's done for West Ham
The editor must be a big incompetent fool. You couldn't cut out Boniface slip but you decided to cut out his actual celebration.
West ham jadi tim Inggris yang merasakan keganasan Leverkusen
Moyes out now
Kudus shouting for the ball but isn't prepared what to do with it when he got it
Fabianski 🙌🏻🔥
Great header by Boniface
I feel bad for y'all west ham fans. I hope u dont have to watch these away performances every 2nd week
Fabianski past it
As long as Boniface scores, I'm happy. That slip at the end though 🤣🤭
Watched until 70 something minute. Turn off the tv Search for the result 2:0 for laverkusen 😮😅
That Antony's ball to Kudus was poor...first time across the defender would have set up Kudus inches closer to the goal and in a more perfect position to score. Something to drag out the gk etc
Leverkusen ❤
west ham proper terrorist ball
Scammaca???
Bayer neverlosen
Super sub from the coach❤
Kudus had a chance and he fluffed it
The story continues for Leverkusen
Shout out to Boniface 🎉
billions of pounds spend, oil monye, external investors and all sorts, constantly poaching players from other leagues...Bayer absolutely humiliated and embarassed this english club. Thankfully, football still has some culture left (only a little). English football fans should be embarassed. Imagine spending all of this money to have 1 shot on goal in 90 mins. Bayer have faced tougher games against 2nd division german sides in the cup. Super league needs to happen to prevent these fraudulent clubs from having access to completely undeserved money
Bayer Neverlusen
Got the wrong opponent huh?😅
Xabi Alonso is the best ❤❤❤❤
Why taking so long to post these highlights
Second goal brought to by the infamous commentator curse
Moyes such a coward. At this stage of an european match you just dont park the bus. If you want to qualify u have ti be on the front foot.  Players like Kudus and Paquetta will be willing to play more offensive football.
david moyes is a disgrace. hes crying about the bench of leverkusen after the game instead of asking himself how the fuck they got 33-1 shot attemps. thats the reason west ham lost not because bayer bench was is disgrace. FOCUS MAN FOCUS
Please explain how can WH play so bad while they have a group of so much talent and experience
who will be next?
Come on your irons
Stop whining west ham fans. We're talking about bayer fucking leverkusen.
Bayer 04 Leverkusen seperti biasa ,tidak ada kejutan.
Kudus same word holly in arabic and kudus is one of city at indonesia
Manchester City should go for Kudus ASAP
LOL that slip was hilarious
Oh i wish they held the score at 0-0, 2-0 was too much for west ham even if they'll play at London
Benrahma laughing out loud ...with his international team mate Ait-Nouri😂
Neverloosen is a reality, i'm sorry for West Ham 💀
FREIBURG won at the first leg, but lose in the second leg. SEVILLA won at the first leg, but lose in the second leg.  FORTUNE'S ALWAYS HIDING I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE  COME ON YOU IRONS!!!!!!
Bayern ae gak mampu. Opo mane westham😂
Luar bisa Bayer leverkusen
You hadn't seen the road roller west-ham😅
Antonio should’ve went solo; we all know he can hit them
Leverkusen absolute dominated West Ham. 77% possession @ 90% accuracy, 33 shots on goal to West Ham's 1. I absolutely love seeing English teams get dominated in Europe. Liverpool's and West Ham's losses, respectively, were amazing. Hopefully Real gets rid of City and Bayern gets rid of Arsenal.
MOYES strategy, Minutes 71 preparing to add on Defenders, Parking More bus. Damn coward. Alonso sub to add more dynamic into attacking. without Paqueta at Home. i dont think West Ham can change the result.
0:20 finding alot of gaps in the midfield,  it seems that every time edson Alvarez is not on the pitch west ham struggles 🤨
So they show Boniface slip but not the celebration. thumbs up from Ghana to the editor
BoniFACE, it's FACE!
รูปเกมส์ เหมือนบอลหมู่บ้าน VS ทีมชาติ😂
Next week plz save your legs and strength for the last 10 minutes. Coz Bayer runs the whole game and add speed on the last 10 minutes
LET'S LAUGH AT WHORE HAM 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Congrats Leverkusen! ❤❤❤
Leverkusen 30+ shots😮
We live to fight another day
🥹🥹🥹🙏
Didn’t show the bookings or Antonio run.
That keeper 😂
so west ham highlights is just 12 second thats it?? 1 shots on target 🤦‍♂
Jonas Hofmann 🇩🇪🏆🔥
Bayer NEVERLOOSEN
Unstoppable from leverkusen amazing team this season ❤
Great Game Bayer 04 Leverkusen 👊👊👊, Great Header From Victor Boniface👏👏🇳🇬💚💚
I'm here for Victor Boniface  Bayer Neverloose
Nayef Aguerd is on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  تبارك الله
That Kudus finish in the early hours was such a poor kick. Uncharacteristic of him.
