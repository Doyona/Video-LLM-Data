"Where are the other drugs going!?"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Original Studio C cast absolutely redefined sketch comedy
flying mouse
Batman is 6'3".   Someone did their their research
Very Funny 😁
🤣🤣🤣
Feel like this was a rip off of college humors much better version.
Damn the studio audience is distracting. 😅 I thought that was just on one video but realizing this is the format.
Anyone who likes this: watch "badman." In fact i yhink this is directly from that. The show is a hilarious parody anyone with a sense of humor should watch.
I belly laughed 😂😂
Que buena estuvo la parte en español  No me la esperaba 😂😂
Hell boy ❤ freak shit fuck shut up love you too baby girl
It’s always good to see Batman not smashing someone’s face in
To anyone who wants to know: Jason Gray is the man who played Batman here in this sketch
The usual Batman❤😂
Laugh track sucks.
wtf is this crap
офигительно весело!
I wanted him to say.    Iambatman whatthefuck?
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
They stole this joke
@danijel dimitrijevic
Bruh i didn't know this thing was international 🤣
I hear a little donald trump😂😂😂
I'm missing the Batman Vs Superman Court cases of humiliating each other for the damn disguise and money insurance company LMAO! 🤣🤣🤣
Of course! No description to tag and credit the artists. Congratulations on contributing to humanity's garbage culture
For Gotham!
Cómo consigues cagar un video que era perfecto 😢
Это Джим Керри?
We didn’t get hear #4.
It is good, but “REALLY SEALS IN THE FLAVOR!”will always be just about the best out of all of them😂😂😂
Nice *trick!!* XD
Was this some improv group Pete was in ?
The setup was beautiful they got him
Fabulous 👌 ❤
Lol bro😂😂😂😂😂
That's not Batman, it's Badman.
Ese doblaje español como para variar deja mucho que desear y hace que se le pierda el chiste del original
The fact that the “IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS”sounds identical to the one in the movie is just a absolute good impression
Hilarious
"IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS" beautiful knowledge
I'm vengeance, im the night, im baaaaaaatmaaaaaaaaan!😂
Adam West: I never said I'm Batman. Even if I said that, it's obvious.
Darn I wanted to hear #4
I’m bat man
Lmao 🤣
😂
The nolan batman did irreparable damage to batman
You have my permission to cry
So Pete Holme’s bit?
That’s him!!
The Spanish version. Yo soy un hombre murciélago! Had me rollin
this is how i imagine nightwing being batman
Why is nobody talking about the second *I    am batman*
Adam West would be proud
"I'm not wearing hockey pads"😂😂🤣
His wearing bat costume dude isn't that obvious?
Trump Batman
"Do I look like a Goalie??" Took me out lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Remember when Pete Holmes did this joke first? Pepperidge farms remembers
Why, does it sound like he's asking the third time he says it?

Yes his bat mann gone nuts😅
Yo soy hombre dell mercielago!!   -Batman

Riddle Me This, I Am The Element Which Cleanses Or Kills, Yet I Am As Deadly As Any Sword, Make Me Angry And I Will Grow  Even Taller Than A Tree.  What Am I ?
Riddle Me This, You Have A Box And It Is Empty, It Weighs Even Less  When You Put Something Inside Of It,  What Do You Put In It ?
After all he's done for Gotham!😂

A scean from the usual suspects haha
Harvey Dent...Can we trust him?
I’d like to see a green lantern movie where depending on the mood or reason he’s different colours lanterns like when he’s fighting for the environment he’s green when he’s in love fighting for his girl he’s red or pink or licac, or when he’s fighting dark forces he’d black.. ya know?

😂 im whatever gotham needs me to be. And that is? I am batman . that's him!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤
"That's him" is hilarious
So good!
I'm what gotham needs.... 🦇
I love rewatching this. I wonder what happened to my old comment?
Did Pete Holmes copy this or did they copy him?
The efforts he's trying not to get caught
GREAT!!!
Cette rôtisserie peut elle être mise sur le brasero plancha de la dernière fois ? Avec le baril ?
You guys ever get a cease and desist from Pete Holmes or College Humor for the shameless ripoff?
Did anyone else hear Bill Hader when he did the Christopher Walken impression ?
Your a lunitic in hokey pads. Ism not wearing hokey pads So you admit your a lunitic
💯💯💯😆😅😂💯💯💯👍👍👍
Batmobile 💥 See Bat-Cat 🐈
Pete Holmes did it better
😂
Jesus loves us
Christopher Walken: “guys, I’m Batman” 🤣🤣☠️☠️
I lost it at the Christopher Walken impression, I can’t breathe 😵😵😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂so funny

Show name please.
Scott sterling asking questions
nice
Batman rules
First guy already failed he said I'm
What the difference between you and me? "I'm not wearing hockey pads"
it's a fair cop..😂
🗿
Cops just never really appreciate this kind of comedy in the moment. Sad
The second time sounded like Jim Carrey
What give you the right? What's different between you and me?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've let it loop and it just keeps getting funnier and funnier, Gawd, I watched it about 10 times and I can't stop laughing. "I'M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PANTS!"
I love these takes on Batman, Pete Holmes always hits it out of the park. If they put together a 2 hour collection of him I'd pay to sit in a theater and watch it.
He moves his mouth like lefty gunplay 😂
The Calling (((☎️))) Is TOÖ STRONG 🦇)))
Ha, this is still funny😆😂🤣👏🏻💯.
Por Dios, como has mejorado con el canto, Mandarino
I love the looks that the next guy in the lineup keeps shooting at Batman. You can almost hear him thinking, 'Someone get this nutjob away from me! All I did was rob a bank!'😂
Sounds like RFK Jr.
This never gets old....😂
did pete holmes steal from this? or did this steal from pete homes?
😂😂😂
I almost lost it the first time I saw this. The Spanish line was the best 🤣. What was this originally from?  I see the channel is called “Studio C”, but I’m not familiar with it.
Studio C died after Season 11
I... am Batman
Which movie is this
Love the Christopher Walken one
I’m Batman?
batman! that’s it 😂😂😂😂
lol 😂
Is this Patrick Holmes?
That's a spork😂
😂😂😂😂
Harvey dent …. Can we trust him…?
Kick him the sack
hilarious
I love helping criminals escape prison
The Italian version of "Ra's al Ghul " is "Pasta Fazool"
This is great! This guy totally nailed the Batman voice when his cowl's on.  I love the Christopher Nolan trilogy of Batman with Christian Bale, but when I watch those movies it's hard not to laugh when Christain Bale's voice gets all nasal with his cowl on. "This isn't a car" "It's not who you are underneath. It's what you do that defines you" By far my favorite line is "I'm not wearing Hockey Pads"
He speaks like Bruce Trump
That Howard
Ha ha ha
Boo laugh track booo
“You are a lunatic and hockey pants.” “I’m not wearing hockey pants!” 🤣
ആരാടാ  batman നെ കളിയാക്കുന്നത്
I lost it when he said, "I'm not wearing Hockey Pads!"
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂صح
Yawn
😂😂😂
"yo soy hombre del murciélago" That can be translated as "I'm man of bat"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 thanks 😂😂😂😂😂i'm Batman 😂😂😂😂😂realy?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂
I'm no native speaker of spanish but I'm pretty sure "hombre del morciélago" is "man of bat" and not "batman", there's an extra "del" in that sentence...
OH NO YOU'RE GOIN TO JAIL! -Robin Willoams, Live at the Met

To much laugh track
Batman has become such a meme it's beyond hilarious 😅
O morcegão tá armado?

Yo soy el hombre murciélago. 😅 So funny.
😅jap2 . Jaja masih 17 la kan?
Oh my god  I'm batman  LoL..... LMAO
Why is this funny to people from USA? I assume no one change the tone of their voice on any conversation so they think is hilarious,  I would appreciate if someone explain that to me
“I’M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!” sent me to Pluto 🤣
The Spanish had me
Whats it called?
for me, the best off all Batman was Ben Afleck
Such good memories ❤
How It Should Have Ended (HISHE) had a great running bit about this in the “Super Cafe” at the end of most superhero related videos.  Worth checking out if you haven’t already.
Who knew im not wearing hockey pads would become the most quoted line in batman 😂
I’m batman

"Youre a lunatic in hockey pads" "IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS" 😂😂😂😂
Ok so, how much mental energy did the guys in the line up used to not laugh at this? XD
"You want me to thay it?" XD
Guys I’m bat man
🤣🤣🤣
Scott Sterling!
The DCU's Batman
Batman, why aren't you wearing Sneakers?  Im not wearing a hickey mask!  You mean a Hockey mask?    Talk to Catwoman about the details!
Is this actually Pete Holmes?
Kkkkkkkkk. Qual o nome desse programa?
I only watched it 10 times.
I am betmen.....badman....batman...beetmen....

Show name pls ?
😅😅😅
That’s him.
Number 3 🧓 i am Batman Weee..  ☝️🤣 Buahahahaha... Muahahahaha..
What's this from
#3: I want it that way/
Que Porcaria Sem Graça.
Because I’m Batman
THIS IS HILARIOUS!!!!!
I'm man
Anything is funny now... People's brains are rotten
Nice touch with Batman being 6'2"
I'm no Batman
This almost comes off as a parody strip appearing in the very early days of MAD Magazine (before issue #24) when they were parodying comic books rather than more mainstream publications.  Especially the pose at the very end.  In fact, I might even be a Batman parody that I'm remembering.
"That's him ! ..." ... [Boys in blue] : "Get'im, boyzzzzz !!!!"  😊👍  😂😂😂
i'm Joseph  🤣
Haha
God its like watching TV on YouTube
Yo soy batman
I think Charles Oliveiras striking style is very much Thai esk, I think he could do well if decided to transition
Lol cant stop laughing I'm batman
🤣💨
Fun facts you don’t have to do this line up without your lawyer present.  You don’t have to say anything at all.  It’s called the 5th amendment.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's Clint Eastwood
Saying his name in Spanish has me fucking dead.
Ha-ha-ha. 😐
thats him... 😂
Bro that voice first one 👌 2th one 💀 3ed one :] 4th one aw hell nah 😐 5th one 😀
Wowza that was bad
Comedy gold Comedy gold
a laugh track does wonders
I would love to see the time where Batman becomes what Gotham needs his to be… A pizza delivery man… “PIZZA FOR GOTHAM!!!!”
Bros Lyin, I’m Batman
Nice one bath man
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was distracted, ok
Studio C is just the best
What show is this from?
I'm batman also
I'm not wearing hockey pads
That Christopher Walken gave me chills
These Pete Holmes clips are hilarious!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
how they got him
If Batman's hands are free, he's not captured and can escape at any time.
Is that Conan O'Brien?
I,m batman???
Am I the only one who thought it sounded like a half decent Trump impersonation at the "do I look like a goalie? No. I'm much more than that"
Probably Canadian tv that’s why it’s not funny
I love how that scene from the Batman movies about wearing hockey pads is just a phrase everyone says now 🤣  Shows you how legendary those movies are
What movie is dis
Hahahahahahaha got em 😅
I will never get tired of watching this
poorman 😂
Pete Holmes was the best bat man    I swear he should've had a side movie deal after all those bad man skits     Where everyone's annoyed by him 😂
I’m the batman baby!
😂😂😂😂😂
Im batman
YO SOY EL HOMBRE MURCIELAGO
🤭
Bro breaks out the Spanish too!  And I’M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!! 😂😂😂💀
Hahahaha! Too good...
Proof cops will twist the narrative to pin you.  This is manipulation
😅😅😅 that's him.
Lol
What show is this?
You're a lunatic wearing hockey pads 😂😂
Have Batman sing "I Want It That Way"
Lmfao 😂
Really that’s supposed to be funny?  Not even close.
Someone stole someone else’s skit
A bunch of grow adults acting like 5 year olds, grow the fuck up losers.
Link? If like order a few.
IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS😡😡😡
Dayumm they caught Batman with that voice.. imagine if he never say a word he might not getting caught 🗿
This is the exact same as the Pete Holms skit...doesnt anybody realize this? i feel like im on crazy pills
Gimme the keys, ya cocksuckah
The name of the series
😂😂😂
The random  batman in Spanish  makes it all the funnier
The Spanish version of I’m Batman had me on the floor crying, you want me to say it really!!!great comedy skit should be taught everywhere. I’m Batman.😂😂😂
Number 4 never got a chance to speak
Why did Batman have to give himself away? 😅
😂😂😂😂
The measurement numbers in fhe background are really irksome. Half of them are missing apostrophes and i cant pay attention to anything else
They stole this bit
The Christopher Walken was PERFECT
So stupid
😂
OK so it's funny even if anyone else does it but this is straight up Pete Holmes bit from Badman.
What the hell? 😅
😂😂
Dr Fishy, NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
😂
Hilarious!!!!!
That lisp as Batman…so Christian Bale! 😂
When the movie came out, where he was called a "Lunatic wearing hockey pads" I heard "Jockey Pants" Which made his reply "I'm not wearing Jockey Pants"Made me think WTF? Does that mean he is going Commando?
should have had the 4th guy have a croaky voice and be like "i have a sore throat today but...I'm batman" and then the witness be like "yep, thats the guy!" :P
Video is muted but I still can hear his voice
😐
Cracked me up lol 😂 LMAO 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
do people find this funny?
I’m not wearing hockey pants!!!
I have to watch this every time it shows up in my feed, just too funny.
thats funny but dont ridicule batman lol man is the goat
Is this a referance to Pete Holmes Badman?
hOw thw HELL did they manage to catch THE BATMAN
NO..IM BATMAN!  HEEEE!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 from Malaysia 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
“Yo soy hombre de murciélago” Qué es ese español JAJA
Thaaaaat's him.
Say what you want they are ripping off funny or die.
Sounded like Eustace from Cowardly Dog 😂
Yo soy hombre del mursiélago 🦇
Which show is this?
"YO SOY HOMBRE DEL MURCIELAGO" got me
Is that pete holmes?
😐
Damn, they got him.😂
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
I honestly can't laugh

Funniest thing i have watched in a long time
Ass.
Classic studio c will always have a special place in my heart.
Just awful!
Name of the tv series?
"YO SOY HOMBRE DEL MURCIÉLAGO" 🗣️
Pete Holmes disapproves
“That’s him.” 🤣
Nah😂😂😂 what language is that
Бэтмен жёт 🤣🔥👍
yo soy hombre da morcielago
I've watched the I'm not wearing hockey pads clip like 2000 times prob. Lol
😂
Espanola me don't know but yes
"do I look like a goalie?"! 😂
😂😂😂
Sounds like clint Eastwood
Spanish: Yo soy el hombre del murciélago 😂😂😅
#phraseit #unusualit
The first one looks like a discount dave grohl.
😂😂😂
And WHO is behind the mask for real?
hahahahahahaha
Americans are so shit at comedy
Capricious Caprisun 😂😂😂
React to Cynic to more jazzy songs.
“I’m Batman???”
Could have avoided the whole thing if he just started with the funny voice lol; I love Studio C’s take on Batman though
Who plays Batman in this
Cop: you’re a lunatic in hockeypads Batman: I’m not wearing hockeypads
I'm Batman
That's not Gotham.
Nah that's owlman
Was this done before the Pete Holmes sketch? Or did Pete do it first? Because they are eerily similar. Like, too close for comfort similar.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
College humor did the whole voice thing first
Clint eastwood as batman
I think Batman would have been better as a guy who owns a comedy nightclub rather than a billionaire. He would have a lot more free time and would understand rejection.
College Humor did this first. Badman with Pete Holmes.
El Hombre Murcielago 😂😂😂👍🏻
Officer coercing the lineup suspect into giving him the evidence he needs
Wasn’t this a College Humor skit? I mean the original?
Commissioner Gordon was like “Omfg. Bats, get your 💩 together or I’m telling Joker or Catwoman! I don’t care which!”
😂😂😂😂 Jesus gets all the glory 😂😂😂😂😂 amen 😂😂😂😂😂 hallelujah 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This one video made me sub😂
I've always wondered what was the point of doing this. Like... Couldn't the suspect just pitch their voice?
Number 4 acting is very good
Passt auf wem ihr vertraut und wem nicht nicht jeder der nett scheint hat keinen bösen Hintergedanken
"yo soy hombre del murcierlago" just say "soy batman"
😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sterling joining the force?
How come no one else noticed batmans huge bulgebin his pants 😅😅
The Spanish killed me 🤣
😂
veommmmmmnn
Hahahahhaha to good😂😂😂😂❤
Why is that guys neck sweating as if there is no tomorrow?
"GUYS, I'M BATMAN!, I'M BATMAN?" That Christopher Walken impression was perfect
😂😂
yeah im man
People find this funny? Oh man...
😂😂😂😂
"im not wearing hockey pads" sounded so accurate
BRUH! I done started choking the more he went on 🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣
That's him😂😂😂😂😂🎉
😂😂😂😂😂
Sounds like trump
Dam he has a package in his pants 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅.
Christian Bale is the most OVERRATED Batman of all time because it’s MOST mocked
This is literally just a copy of Pete Holmes popular Batman video and it pisses me off that other people don’t see that.
😂😂😂😂
So creative 😂 keep it up
Pete Holmes?
Please name
More i watch this more enjoyed. How these guys nearby did not laugh i don't understand. 😂
:D :D :D
Did Pete Holmes lose a foot in height?!!!
"I am whatever Gotham needs me to be" "And that is?" "I'm Batman" 🤦‍♂️😂
Who is cheering for that voice
This whole concept sucks. And You should all be elevated more than 20 years more than this. You should all feel ashamed. This is garbage. Genuinely Garbage.
I'm batman??? Got me rolling
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Which show is this.😂
'im not wearing hockey pads, do i look like a goalie.
Lol
Haha he did Christopher walken his voice
"Now number 5!"
I'm not wearing hockey pads! 🤣
you're a lunatic and you're wearing hockey pants I am not wearing hockey pads I am Gotham what it needs to be and that is I am Batman 😂
Number 4: "Phew. Glad he took the fall for that. What are the chances a batman cosplayer got put in the lineup."
I can't 😂
Humor is dead
Kind of stolen from Pete Holmes but okay..
Let’s face it, any comedy bit in this setting will forever be overshadowed by the Brooklyn 99 Backstreet Boys theme.
I didn’t laugh
This might be my favorite youtube short ever
Reminds me of when COMMEDY was good 😂💯😎😅
Died when he went to Spanish 😂
'That's him' 😂
I love this video
Batman: F###
"That's him!" *LOL!*
20:19 because each block is 1 meter, that isn’t 53 inches, that’s 2086.61 inches 💀
Batman and joker Batman is Useing grandma sounds this is the funniest batman this so amazing 😂😊🧓🧓🦇🦇
Wait a sec he is not bruce in batman suit but trump in batman suit
Lmao I can’t help but be reminded of “which one of these tubes do you smell through?”
If Batman ever came at Joker with these voices, he'd die laughing.
Gold miner is my favourite
😂 man, so dum
They are try-harding so hard, but they only used harden.
your a lunatic in hockey pads 😂
Why that guy dressed in a Bat suit sounds like the billonaire Bruce Wayne?
😂😂😂😂😂
Last one didnt get his chance, I think he's the real batman.
YO SOY HOMBRE DEL MURCIÉLAGO
I am whatever Gotham needs me to be...😂
XD
i’m batman.
Amazing! That's wild! I was in writing for visual media class today and we looked at a bunch of scripts! I saw dark knight and just started scrolling then stopped at a random spot and it was the part with the "im not wearing hockey pads" 😅🤣👌🏻 brilliant stuff, man!
Damn, Scavenger! Nice shooting on those flyers. You are the master hunter here.  P.S. you two are bonkers!
Completely stolen skit from Pete Holmes What the fuck? Legit word for word stolen from "Batman Finds his Voice" by Pete Holmes as "Badman"
Why was Batman talking in his deep voice when he could have used a phony voice to begin with?
Batman: _[starts singing I want it that way]_
His first voice sounded like scuba steve from big daddy 😂
i..M bAtMan 🧓
Pete Holmes?
Number 1 step forward a sing the opening to I want it that way
that gruff batman voice was the worst ever.
Oh is *this* where Ryan George got the "I'm not wearing hockey pads!" from? Or is this joke even older?
First, Batman is offended because they didn't recognise him.  Second, I don't know if they wanted to say it by his mouth or they just framed him.😂
Absolutely love the actor that's playing Batman, he's one of the most talented of the group being able to do all different types of voices and different characters it's really a great😂
He went from Christopher Walken to Keanu Reeves and ended with Will Forte. Damn, that's impressive.
This feels like a "Pete Holmes' Badman" sketch. I liked it.
"And that is?" 😂
Rorschach stole Batman's suit
AND IM EGG
Well the literal way of the "don't judge others just by their looks" u just gotta dig deeper in them even if it is hilariously obvious 😂😂 🤣🤣
That Christopher Walken 😂😂
Im batman
He is asking Batman to say he is Batman
you needed him to say it? lmaoooo
"Yo soy hombe de mecielago" Entendible, tenga un buen dia.
Should of done: #1: I am vengeance  #2: I am the night #3: I. AM. BATMAN.
Blud said I am Batman🤠
Bro 😎
The Tommy Wiseau impression was top notch
i love how he said in confusion iM bAtMaN?
What is this from
“i’m bingle”
Isn't that the batman from college humor?
Justis!
And what's that? "I'm Batman."  We got em. 😂😂😂
I      AM STEVE.
You are
_🎵TELL ME WHY-EE🎵_
I guessed brazil just off what I learnt from a few rainbolt tiktoks. I havent even played the game before. Im proud of myself.
I’m Batman??
Lmfao I’m dying 😂
Omg redneck batman is killing me im dying just imagine him and Robin get to a scene he gets out the batmobile cracks a coors light takes a deep draft then he says something like hey bird boy hold mah beer 🍻 shoving it to him before pulling out a 12 gauge batgunn and a Marlboro red cigarette
It sounds like old ian from smosh
The Spanish still gets me
Is this not just pete holmes bit?
Hilarious!
“I’m Batman?” Is that a question? 😂
That was shill asf😂
The Spanish f-ing got me 😂😂 💀
I.... AM STEVE!
Interrogator knew his psychology inside and out. Batman lost before a word was even spoken
This supposed to be funny?
Laugh tracks make everything they touch unfunny
Yo soy el hombre murciélago 🦇
WHERE IS SHE?!
His Batman voice sounds like Trump 😂😂😂
Oh it's Pete Holmes, didn't recognise him until he spoke.
Wow this actually pains me
Did they steal this from college humour or vice versa
wheres the funny?
Number is just waiting his turn
Was that the gmd dance wtf istg
I love how it took till the end for the victim to say "that's him"
That's funny I think the cop is Batman lol
Boy, this is so stupid
Yo soy hombre de murcielago LMAO
One day we’ll move past this christian bale raspy voice shit 😮‍💨
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
This joke never made sense to me. Who was the lineup for? Criminals would never have the right to ask for a lineup. And Batman never committed a crime on anyone stupid enough to report him.
What the hell is that? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In the original version, it shows Jason (As Batman) walking off and say, "Tell Alfred to feed my fish."
Yo soy hombre de murciélago.
Cringe
bros bricked up 😂😂
This should be in moon knight when jake controls the avatar and thinks hes batman 💀
Boomer humor is soo cringe lol.
This feels nearly entirely lifted from Pete Holmes sketch. Even many of the voices/impressions are the same
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Idk how those other guys kept a 😐
I miss the original Studio C
People really be sleeping on suspect number 4
Pete Holmes called...
This is gold.
I’m Batman?
Random guy - "Whats the difference between me and you..." Batman - "Im not wearing hockey pads"
Batman when he sees the bat signal
Not even a little bit funny
"i'm...batman..??"
That's him😂😂😂
Bro oats came out of my fricking nose laughing at this
This is top tier comedy if you're a Mormon.
He did wear a hockey pads though just saying
It takes a cowl to cover that scowl
Batman sounds like trump
“GUYS, I’m Batman.” 😂
I am bat Trump
😂😂😂
And That is??   I'm Batman!!  That's him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What if gotham needed a goalie...😅
God bless everyone ❤🎉✝️
God bless ❤ amen ! lol 😂
Stupid and hilarious
This is so unfunny
Ahhhh, the good old Studio C. Those times were great!
Isn't this from Pete Holmes
... is that where Linkara got his hockey pads joke?
😂😂❤
“Hi. I’m Bruce Man -I mean I’m bat Wayne. F*ck!”
Isnt nr. 1 the guy from the fortune cookie sketch
Edgy BatTrump
LOL
Excellent
"Now number fiiiive"
Batman if he were an old-timey prospector
The third time sounded hilarious, he sounded British and confused, so just british
😳😳😳😳 how dumb..😂😂😂😂
Give ME the keys ...
Good luck getting Batman in there in the first place cops, dosnt matter how "traind" or should i said un-traind you are. You are not capable of doing anything at all to batman simply because hes not a vigilante in a halloween costume. And hes a billion times more qualified then most of the cops on the planet to work with crime fighting.
The policeman is Scott Sterling!
🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😭
Hilarious!
Did we really need the lineup???? I'm in tears 😂
The cop sweating his ass of lmao
Feels like a copy of Pete Holme's skits
A lot of these jokes were stolen from college humor
Trying very hard to be funny and not funny at all
Sorta sounded like Jack Nicholson towards the end 🤔
"Now number 5"
The laugh tracks really ruin this skit. Whoever added those should be prosecuted to the fullest extent. Laugh tracks weren’t in the original video For A Reason…
RFK
thatd him. 😂
Yess old studio c!! This brings back so many memories both of watching it, and how life was when i watched this for the first time. Simpler times 😌
Batman kill peoples dat movie really wanna see it 😮
batman speaking Spanish is not what u can see everday
YO SOY HOMBRA DE MURCIELAGO
Wasn't expecting that end, haha xd
I think they took this from pete Holmes
Wait, The Kid is Batman??  Next you’re gonna tell me Franklin is actually Robin!  IYKYK
The dudes on either side of him trying to hold it together
Glad this is making a return.😂
Yo soy😂
"and that is?"... Gotcha!😂😂😂😂😂
Did I see him at the DNC? Lunatic!
“That’s him” lol
Stole Pete Holmes Batman
el sinor dela noche
Similar to Lee Harvey Oswald's line ups
The absolute worst version of Batman fact.  Although it did have one of the best Jokers.
The Batman was indeed caught in this video! Love how he goes and says “I’m Batman” but in Spanish lol
The Christopher Walken Batman was on point
😂😂😂😂
Whats the tape on the back of his neck for? A wire?
This is a stolen skit
Yo Soy El Hombre Murciélago😂
I AM JUSTICE.
😂😂😂😂
This is genuinely so un funny
Damn it these interrogators are good😂😂😂
The christopher walkens impression was so good
Idk if it’s just me but is this not just basically the college humor Batman sketch just tweaked a little but
Would have been funnier if the 4th got his turn, and HE sounded like Batman.
Finally, that's him
Never gets old😂😂
"Yo soy hombre del murcielago" 😂
Zounds like trump😂
I heard a touch of Trump at some points throughout that skit.
Now I wanna see Christopher Walkins as Batman😂
The best part is that the dude had to wait till the end to confirm "Yes, that's him". 😂😂😂
I wonder who did this bit first? Them or Pete Holmes?
Let me guess, excessive violence? Again?😂😂
That's him.
Ohh boy Nolan did give us the most memorable Batman lines and Christian Bale the most memorable Batman voice didn't they.
Clint? Clint Eastwood? Is that you?!?
I like how the cops is persistent that its gotta be #3..... Like this happens every Monday😂
😂
“Guys I’m Batman” caught me lacking 🤣🤣🤣
🎶 "Now Number Five" 🎶
Pete doesn't get enough appreciation.
Pete Holmes did it better
I think a lawyer could attack this line-up as too prejudicial.
您好您好您好
*I'M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!!* Batman said Calmly
Pete Holmes did it first
Lol
Pete Holmes
I miss this show so much
I laugh every time.
This is AI humor. You guys are tasteless
whats this from?
This is bad..not funny at all. Who wrote this sketch?
*I CANT SKATE!*
My face hurts! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
OK did he say  fat man or bat man?
Batrump
I'm batman in Spanish lol😅
Lmao never knew I needed to see a skit with Batman in it..
“Where are the other drugs going?”
That's him 😂
Old studio C brings back memories
This isn’t really very funny tbh
Batman from Bikini Bottom
Cop looks and sounds like dennis from it's always sunny
the Christopher walken got me
That's him
I am batman 😎
I have no contact relationship with my parents. They were never as abusive as the rest of the parents from the other comments here. Sure we've had our arguments but we just sort of drifted apart. We kind of realised as I grew up, I became my own person, with core differences and we're the kind of people that wouldn't hang out with each other.  Visits became less frequent, calls became shorter. Then my parents and I just didn't have that longing to see each other anymore.  They both divorced when I was young and both remarried with their respective partners. We sort agreed that they both have their own families to tend to now and there's no room for me or my siblings in each of their lives. So we live our lives like strangers.  The last time I met them both, they both mentioned they wouldn't expect me to help them as the grow old. They have savings and plans to support themselves without me. So, I guess I'm grateful in a way, we agreed to drift apart without major drama.
This is comedy?
Finally, something actually funny on YouTube.
BATMAN GOT THAT RASPY TRUMP VOICE😂😂
Cant help to think they barrowed this idea from another creator 😢
Thats a very funny premise
Try having to make a hot beverage for Christian bale …when he’s angry …when your 18 😂 not a nice dude still traumatized 13 years later haha…sounded like this skit haha
Did i hear choose goose??😊
He sounds like Trump.
I refuse to subscribe to this channel because of this sketch. It’s literally a complete and total ripoff of Pete Holmes badman scratch where he’s finding his voice and does different impressions. Never to be forgiven for this one
And to think I thought it was Jim Carey!
Yep, the voice gives him away.  He can kick the costume.  It doesn't work.
I give a lot of respect to the extras for not laughing. I was already giggling on the first "I'm Batman."
Yo soy off brand Pete Holmes.
Bat man is not any good and completely gay
Comedy has really gone downhill
Brilliant
I love Jason
That’s jayingee
Hilarious 😂😂
Soo does College humor know you copied their skit?
I'm Batman man 🤠
Lmao 😂😂😂. That was good. I needed a laugh.
😂😂😂
"Yo soy hombre de murciélago" was hilarious 💀💀💀
BATMAN POPPED MUCIELAGO💀💀💀 what's next, segunda etapa?
Batrump man.
You rip it up with a spoon or a knife and then put the whole pizza in the freezer for a while to make sure it’s ready
He couldn’t help saying it in the end 😂 perfect 👌🏼
😂😂😂😂😂
So like...did they just directly ripp off pete holmes badman videos or am i missing some context here?
What if Gotham needs him to be a goalie?
Give me Pete Holmes
Im Fatman
Seems like they just stole Pete Holmes joke.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine line up was better
Batman got caught by the police??? Come on.
Im fuccin cryiiiiiin !!! 😂😂😂
It's still kinda funny everytime.
🤣😂
He's actually Christopher Walken's voice coach.
That's sum funnee sht
😂😂😂😂😂
Ahahaha 🤣👍 ahahaha
Lady’s and gentleman we got em
😂
You sure that's not Bat Dad?
Que hombre loco, Senhor?!
I don't know how the other 2 guys did not laugh.
Is that Pete Holmes?
its the "im batmaann????" for me
This is just wish version of @peteholmes
Pretty good Christopher Walken lol
Batmam?
The fact that ppl thinks this is funny just goes to show how bad humor a lot of humans have
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So good
Morciegalo😂😂😂
Is that conan?
I just noticed how much Batman sounds like F-22 from Habitual Line Crosser...  Would you intercept me? I'd intercept me.
😂😂
I understand th refranse the hocky pads
that Pete Holmes Joke tho =- T
....is it a show for children ???
Fackin' sheer class ...am in stitches with lafter....
Ok I must be missing something… What’s funny????? 😭
na k...c te metnem.
How is this funny 💀💀💀
It's not funny 🤣
This wasnt funny but i guess people will be sheep
Damn BD, u let them fool u that easy! 🤣🤦‍♂️
The 1989 Bat Man would have been so much better had they cast Herve Villachez!  Cause...you know...Keaton just wasn't short enough. But Villachez' voice??? Perfection!!!
No 4 "where is my dialogue?
Who did the Batman here?
Even the Joker would laugh!!!
Gotem 😂
I'm Batman.  Kkk. Morcegão. 😅😂😊
👆🏻 "That's him." 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I'm whatever gotham needs me to be"  ...and if gotham needs a hockey goalie?
😂😂😂
Im what ever got them needs mecto be the joket helped more then any one
Abed is Batman now
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can it be possible that God makes to life the comic book movie myth Batman alive and makes a real living Batman? Yes... I am the real batman
wtf is this shit
can i like this video 100 times? 😂
After all that he got caught. I'm batman 😂
Studio C had some brilliant skits.
I'm not wearing hockey pads 🤣
Will Arnett is fantastic!!!
Terrible...
That was actually funny. Remember when SNL was funny?
So. Much. Of that sounds like sexism + homophobia + transphobia.  It’s all shit that those other than well off cis white xtian men deal with in varying ways.  You, dear, are a woman. You may be a trans woman, but you’re still a woman. Assholes will be there to be assholes forever. You do you and love the beauty that you have the chance to relish in.  Also the idea of “normal” is bullshit. Everyone hides their true selves because there is no normal and the bigots relish in it. They hate themselves and push it on the rest of us.   Fight in, don’t ever give up, you are loved and important.
Sounds like Clint Eastwood
Harvey dent.  can we trust him?
This never gets old....just pops up from time to time.
😁😆😆😆😆😆
😅
Lame.
this is the shittiest comedy I've ever seen.
This not funny whiy is this on my time line
After the Mexican one I think it was Ross Perot….oooh hey, you think he still might want to be President?
Where were the other drugs going, fuck face?😂
I need the last guy to stay it..
“Yo soy el Morcegón!” 🗿😂
BATMAN : im batman❌ MICKEY MOUSE : im batman ☑️  😭😭😭😭😭
Would've been funny if after the last one Joker yelled out "That's him! "😂
Spectacularly unfunny
It was funny enough that Batman was there It’s funnier still that he said it in Spanish🤣
😂😂😂
And right now we need you to be nobody 😂😂😂
Lol
WHO SENT YOU, WHO?!?!?
They really dragged that out
Jeff Beck! 🎉  "Who Else"!  You and your music are eternal. 🕉  "Chaos and beauty" - Mission accomplished mate. 🎸   You brought heaven down to earth 🌎 ✨️ 🎶  Now you're in heaven and we're listening and looking up to you from earth.  Fly on brother ✌️ ☮️ 🕊

American comedy, coming soon..
😂😂
"I'm 'Walken' Batman"
I m Batman
Oh no, looks pretty cool & dialogue seems fun, but I cant get past the fake /or not fake audience sounds...😅 Takes one out of the 'moment'...😆
A lunatic in hokey pads
Poor 4th guy never got a chance to say it
And if it says "Mary loves the John" sorry, just had to.
Yo soy hombre murcielago 😂😂🎉🎉🎉🤭🤗🤗

😭🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂
This made my day 😂
poor batman he has good intent but the police don't trust him xD
Peter Griffin is batman. 😂
Fun fact: "Yo soy hombre del murciélago" translate to "I am man of the bat". He didn't even say "I am Batman" in Spanish.
Didnt college humor basically do this same skit?
What actor is that? he reminds me of the batdad that used to do vines
"Yo soy hombre del murciélago" 😂😂 me recuerda a Brendan Fraser en Al Diablo con el Diablo
This is soooo much better when you’ve watched the Dark Knight 😂🤣
The real amazing actors are the two guys standing next to him not laughing 😂
“That’s Him”😔
The last part he talked like Donald Trump... hehe
Batman sounds like a dehydrated Trump 🤣🤣🤣
he's badman, alright
Christopher Walken impression had me dying 😂😂
FINALY he spoke the line.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I honestly don’t understand why Batman is saying the phrase. He is literally wearing the Batman suit.
Ewww byu tv
😂😂😂
Yep thats him!!
😂😂😂
Sounds like DJT 😅
I think Bruce Wayne has had one too many this time. 😁
LAUGH TRACKS ! my lorde the fucking Cringe.
I'm Scruggsman😂
Trump
Fool ❌ Foo  ✅
About the  near history of publishing the video, reminder for glorious day to fight colonization and brutal apartheid
The sketch would have been funnier if he wasn't the real Batman.
¡Soy el hombre de murciélago!
😂that’s him
Haha, hilarious, thank you so much
Wow GCPD actually doing their jobs for once.
Bat man has a serious problem for years
Got him easy at the end😂😂😂

Tell me why
I love Studio C lol
Theres a video Similar to this. Im pretty sure its called "batman finds his voice" its really funny. If you like this you should check out that video 🎉
I'm upset this made me laugh at 12:30 am lol
In swedish jag är läderlappen
Legend has it, number 4 is still waiting for his cue till this day
Efectivamente: yo soy hombre del murciélago
i thought that was the BatDad.
The real angel for Nate is Harriet 😢
Are there people that are actually 3ft tall?!
“That’s him” 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's yo soy el hombre murcielago
This is not funny
*ayem venjens~ !*
Complete genius
Hilarious^^
I can definitely see this as an actual scene I a Batman movie. Would be great.
i got this short right after a skit about batman lol
Didn't College Humor already do this?
No fair - they tricked him!
Funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is hilarious! 😂😂😂
I don't remember this episode of Wizards of Waverly Place
The one where it sounded like a question was my favorite that had me rolling
And that is? I am batman! That's him! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Batman on high😅
Ahahhahaaa 😂😂
IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!!!🥷

hdjdvkdhxkgxjdnxbdkbxmbxmnxbnx😊
Batman be packing bro wtf
I’m Batman 🤠
I live in the shadows…justice…for GOTHAM
Is this Canadian? Is that what’s going on?
I have never understood why criminals comply with the police in a lineup. You are not required to speak. You literally have the right to remain silent.
Yah
“gUyS, iM bAtMaN”
Why does he sound like metal Trump
Gademit he had one job
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Corny
Cringe
This has to be the least funny channel to ever make its way into my algorithm
The Adam Sandler dance is too much 😂😂😂
This isn’t funny.
The last guy didn't get the chance to say it.
So they just shamelessly copied the Pete Holmes bit?
Ich bin Fledermausmann
What show is this?
I can't tell who's Batman. Maybe he's that tall standing next to the guy who's dressed up as a bat. I think he was suspect Number 4.  Suspect Number 3 gets exposed: Goddammit.
He sound like Donald Trump 😂😂
"I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be" "and that is?" "VENGANCE"
When he goes full Spanish, I’m dead! 😂😂
My fucking god man lmfao rn 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😅
“Guys…I’m Batman” did it for me! 😂
Clint Eastwood is that you?😅
😆😆😆😆😆😆
Sounds strangely like Donald Trump🧐
Is that a Christopher Walken impression?
I'M WHAT EVER GOTHOM NEEDS ME TO BE and that is IM BATMAN 💀
I’m Batman hehehehe
Dude.. you are completely wrong about Gen-X😂
IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS! 😂
The ugly baby was my all time Studio C skit. Absolutely hilarious.
Why is his pronunciation a tinge like Trump? Hahaha
GOTEEEM!!!😂😂😂
Studio C is like a better modern SNL now that I think of it
The bricked bat
What is this from
Wait...was the first guy Dave Grohl?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
is number 1 Dave Grohl?
Batman
This is bad….
Why does bro sound like im a squid kid
I’m Batman 🤠🤠
People talking about his Christopher Walking impression. His Jim Carey impression is slept on.
😂😂
🩲
When GCPD goes against Batman and tries to find out his true identity using his voice😂
That is unrealistic Batman is a billionaire he would never get arrested
Am I the only one who heard Tommy wiseau voice?
I wish I could double like this
The Dark Knight: The Golden Age of Batman. 🦇
Naw im a goalie
Im only shorter than the 6 foot guy
I love how im 12 and im taller then most of these people by 2 inches
Guys I'm batman😂😂😂😂😂😂
I still, Pee my pants laughing at this one, every time I play it… It’s the best skit …ever…end of story 👍🏼
What if Gotham needs a goalie?
not even that funny
Oh yeah that was a good movie cool parody😂
He is in jail that's where Gotham wants him to be 😂
American humor is so fucking bad
I love how I can identify Scott Sterling from the back of his head
Do you know why i am watching it?  *_BECAUSE HE'S BATMAN_*
"you are my fire"
I’m….Batman…?? 😨”
The hockey pads😂😂
Stealing jokes from Pete Holmes.
Always sounded like Donald Trump to me
Back when studioC was actually good
This feels like a joke Brooklyn 99 would make.
I miss mat
I’m gonna find you😡
Is that pete holmes?
This is so funny
This doesn't get old.
Is this in a show or movie? If so whats it called?
Brilliant original comedy from Studio C. 🎉😮Again!!!
Jason Todd’s face transitions from normal to having a bat on it, the bat most likely being the “mark of the bat” previously mentioned when Bruce broke into Arkham and left the mark on the bodies of the patients.
😂😂
I love how it’s clearly not filmed in front of a live studio audience.
😂😂😂😂
Yo soy hombre del murcielago 😂😂😂
Is this supposed to be funny
You are my fire
Thats not batman bat the man
Now number 5🎵🎶🎵🎼🗣️🗣️
Well , as a batman i 💯% disagree with it! I wont get into such traps! Do you know why?    Because i am *BATMAN*
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hes had plus r
Who plays the dude in the Batman suit??  He's hilarious 😂
Wouldve been funnier if they just moved onto the last guy instead and he proceeded to do a pitch perfect batman impression, then they go "yep thats him" so that number 3 actually is just a random lunatic and the fourth guy is the true culprit
I loved that he gets triggered by the hockey pads thing 😂
Does he sound like trump?
I think everyone noticed but nobody is gonna talk about it
Is that Larry David??
He sounds like Donald trump
Batman is 6 ft only I thought he would be 7 ft
Disregard depreciation and any incurring costs $20 profit
I just left this video running for like 25 minutes on accident. Ur welcome
"I'm batman?"
For some reason I DK but it feels like this Batman can speak like Donald Trump
Lol
too good
Officer- a lunatic in hockypads. batman- IM NOT WEARING HOCKYPADS!! love thr fact that he doesn't deny his lunacy😅😅😅
Why does Batman sounds similar to Mr  trumps voice
This is straight out of the Pete Holmes Batman finding his voice sketch.
I'm.....*Batman*? 😮
I’m… Batman?😂😂😂
Isn't "I'm not wearing hockey pads!" from a YouTube video?
No. He is Man. Who tf is Batman? Is he stuoid?
Nolan really screwed Batman up with that voice.
SOME ONE SUMMING ME
Christian Bale impersonation was also very good.
😂lol
😂😂😂
IM BATMAN yeeheehee!🤠
What my movie is this
real
😂😂😂😂
One of the best skits of all time.
I wonder what No.4 would say?
The first one was like im fatman
What this on
"That's him."
“IM NOT WEARING HOCKY PANTS”!
I can't tell who that is. The jaw looks like Affleck, but the voices make me think it's Hader.
😂😂😂😂
Realistically, I'm pretty sure they can't just say "That's not gonna cut it" to someone's voice.
😂
That shit aint rly funny at all
Im batman??
Why does everyone go for that godawful Bale Batman voice?
Is that bill burr?
I used to love Studio C
That’s him🤣
This channel is the best thing the Mormons ever gave us
I have always genuinely wondered why line up suspects don’t do this or if it would work.
yo soy hombre del murcielago
I'm Batman
Is that Donald Trump?
The spanish 😂
Hahaha 🤣
Shocking people think this is funny
fr
My favorite batman

😂😂😂😂
The first guy looks like he's a weezer fan
Wow that was bad
I remembered GTA V online short
Erm buddy nueron Activation is not how you get people to get your product
College humor vibes
Number 1 looks like Dave Grohl
It’s like a sitcom
i cant watch batman movies without laughing anymore "im not wearing hockey pads" "where is she?!" these type of lines crack me up now
Im batman
666
SNL has become dogshit
He's whatever Gotham needs him to be. And Gothem needs him to be Batman
Plot twist....it was number 4.

😂
Hahahahahhahaha    Lol love it😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
IM BATMAN  I live in the shadows  *deep breath* JUSTICE FOR GOTHEMMM😳 I need to go to the batgave Batman needs his supplies  *deep breath again* FOR GOTHEM!🦇🧔‍♂️ SIDE INTO BATTLE     FOR GOTHEM🦇

I'm not wearing hockey pants!
I want a movie where its just a normal batman film but whenever he says "I'm batman" its just one of these
This reminds me of the college humor skit where batman finds his voice. Actually i even think this is the same batman actor
😂😂
"Im batman" "Thats him" "..fuck."
IDIOT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Cringe
This reminds me of the college humor batman videos
Is that Phillip graves from cod mw2
Why sound so much like Trump

❤❤
Blessings in an abundance of the faith. I salute you. 😘🙏Grace and peace be unto you and to this place. God bless you. Thank you. Will you believe and receive Jesus Christ as your LORD and personal saviour??? I do. 😊
These guys to Pete Holmes:  "Hey can I steal your homework?"  "Sure just make it look a bit different"
IM BATMAN... I LIV IN THA SHADOES! FOR GOTHUM! SLIDE INTA BATTLE... FOR GOTHUM!
Anyone else find this cringe?
Don't forget batman is an alcoholic, no wonder his voice is that cracked and shady 😂
HAHAHHAHA THE "that's him" ahhahaha
Damn... BatMan is packing some serious heat 🔥 in those hockey pants. 💀

"I'M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!" "Yea- I know.. listen, when your triangle blades hits a flesh neck... what happens?" "They... they go sleep just like me. Then they wake up just like me. Usually with a boner. I call it the 'Bat Signal'."
“I want it that way”
Batman being petty. 😂
A classic
I banana man
This is when Studio C was good
Literally just ripping off the College Humor Batman skit where he chooses his voice. He’s even acting like the CH Batman and not actual Batman.
Isn't this a pete holmes skit?
I never knew Batman was a hippie 😂
😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣‼️‼️‼️ BECAUSE IM BAT🦇MAN‼️‼️‼️
That bat man remind me, Adam West bat man.
Iam groot
Pete Holmes is the true Batman.
What is the name of this show
If you ever feel useless, just remember that batman killed superman first and is yet to do anything to the joker besides rough him up a little everytime he commits genocide
Bro even started speaking espanol 🤣
Gave me the chills
Funny thing, Batman is actually a good ventriloquist in the story.
so this i s a rip off of badman which has been round for a long as fuck time , pretty sad to see material stolen
I’M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!!!😂🤣😂🤣 gets me every time 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Because of course Batman is a master of many voices

Why does the cop sound like Graves from the new mw trilogy

Fucking straight ripoff of Pete Holmes!!! He did this exact thing in his "badman" series, several years ago!!!
"Hombre murciélago" no hombre del murcielago
For a moment I thought that this was mad TV.
Ladies and Gentlemen...             We got him
This is funnier than anything SNL has done in 15 years
Soy Batman XD este canal no es español pero aun así comento

😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
Why doesnt he just pull the "HARVEY DENT, CAN WE TRUST HIM?"
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Easy to spot hombre de murcielago.😅
🤣🤣🤣 Avoided to say it in his own voice before he announced himself. The Hispanic phrase had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
Funny how he was led to say it at the end and got caught.
Reminds me of that old collegehumor sketch where he's trying to pick his Batman voice and goes through a dozen different ones before he just screams, then loses his voice, and his hoarse post-scream voice is the one he settles on.
god, how much i hate the american sense of humor
We need more of these Batman skits.
"Yo soy hombre del murciélago!!" 😂😂😂😂 guys, it's not that hard to use Google translate if you don't know Spanish buy maybe is better for the comedy if you never use it 🇪🇦
😂😂jjjkaja
Забавно! 😅
IM MOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS
Repeated content?
This is way too funny
What's wrong with that ladies face. She has the face of a dog or mouse. Ooooh another nightmare battle coming up soon. I never seen people fight over cheese until now which is hilarious 😅
😂😂😂😂 do I look like a goalie 🤣🤣
Sounds like peter though😂😂
Sounds like Clint Eastwood in Batman voice in the beginning and at the end..
The best version of Batman
Just plead the fifth
Sounds like Trump😂
"Thats him"......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Show name?
"I am Batman" That's him 😅
The last guy who didn't speak was actually....el hombre del murciélago 🦇 .
I hate when gringos try to speak spanish when they had no idea of it
😂😆😂
Christian Bale really left an impression on all of us with that throat cancer Batman voice.
He didn't even denied being a lunatic, but the hokey pads thou...
The batman's voice is just iconic 😂
Funny! In real live don't be part of a line up. Repeat after me "Based on advice from my lawyer, I'm not doing it." Not legal advice. Not a lawyer.
Hey
🤣
What this a movie or series and what's the name
Great by C studio of Batman saying his name
I was a boy, now I'm a baaat-wait wrong channel
😊  I  love the batman 😍 in dark knight 😍
Do I look like a goalie? 🤣
Is that pete holmes?
Batman meme
Its obviously the first guy
Hilarious
"Thats him!" Thats funny af😂
What this show called 😂
Atleast batman should be happy that the cops in his town do not judge by looks and identity and actually tries to find confirming proofs and evidences
I guess after blowing all his money on buying the moon he couldn't afford bail.
Ripped off college humor so bad
This guy is awsome. XDD
That Pete Holmes?
Batman why did you did manslaughter why did you do manslaughter photos turned back in the 90s your name and manslaughter😂😂
😂😂
Is this the parody of I want it that way?
"I am whatever Gotham needs me to be"  -Batman "And that is? " - Officer "I AM BATMAN" - Batman "That's tight" - Officer "Fuccccck" -Batman
I'm bat man 🤠🤠🤠
Was this supposed to be funny
Walked homie off the plank tho  lol... that's him
Lol
Batman[a] is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.
yo soy el hombre murcielago*  Batman needs to learn some spanish😂
i am whatever gotham needs me to be.  a whore
I'm still not convinced that's Batman 🦇

I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be  And that is?  I'm Batman  That's him   Pure genius 😂
Since the other 9 was added to the equation... that makes it 9(9)+1 which makes it 81+1=82. 82 is the answer
Wasnt this done by... cant remember his name atm, major brain fart sorry, but college humor? Badman finds his voice?
Ho my god

Stolen from Pete Holmes. It’s the same premise, same joke, just not as funny
Lmao
Yo soy hombre del murciélago   That was so random caught me off guard😊
Неожиданный поворот.
The original college humor is better than this seems like a rip off
I'm here for the Christopher Walken batman version.
😂😂😂😂😂

Snl?
Pete Holmes did it firsr and better as "Badman" on College Humor.
guys im baTmAn
Is it weird I hear trump in his  voice? maybe trump with a sore throat lol
😂😂... " thats him " ...😅😅
Why do I feel like this version of batman could've been Donald Trump when he was younger?
is it just me, or did batman sound a little like biden
When he said it in Spanish, that caught me so off guard.🤣
Ok, we still didnt hear the forth one though..
I'm batman 😈😈😈😈
Am I the only person who found this the most unfunny thing I have ever witnessed
Batman witnessing murder: 🗿😀😜  Batman when he sees a 3 year old jay walking: 😱💥💥🦇👿
This is literally college humor's skit stolen
"That's him"
I’m crying 😂
ROTFLMAO
Man I miss the og cast. But hey atleast Jason is still there.
😂😂😂😂
Everyone's Batman impression is so bad like if you actually know what Batman sounds like he has a raspy deep voice he doesn't need sound like that some weird gremlin
Sound like Trumph 😂
Stole the idea fro. Pete holmes
If this ain't Pete Holmes this be stealing
When he said "I'm Batman" i felr that
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The head movement is great
Got him!
I would never comply with this, I would fight it in court and sue them for infringement of my constitutional rights and for the breach of basic common sense. *OBVIOUSLY* the actual perp is going to change his voice when being forced to repeat a line he said to the victim.
Get to the chopper. !.
Now I want a Christopher Walker version of bat man 😂
Is this the same guy who played Batman in the Collegehumor parodies
Cringe asf
Mickey mouse: I'm batman
That’s him 😂
Christian Bale did too good a job
Eipping off pete holmes. Ripping off material from another comedian. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Thumbs down. So whack.
Is the actor running the lineup the dude from Always Sunny in Philadelphia?
Feels like someone watched a few Pete Holmes' Badman videos...
Some jobs give you Juneteenth off?
is it keaton hood with dark knight suit???,
You really want me to say it, guys I Batman, I'm Batman, that's him 🤣😂🤣
Straight stolen from college humor
So was this an SNL skit or a CollegeHumor video first
The background actor who is playing number four is like I don’t even get to say a line?
The costume wasn’t a clue?
Don't feel like that you say I just got faster supplemented I am that you
Studio C so nostalgic
This is literally a rip off of Pete Holmes Batman skit
Didnt laugh once
Ripped straight from college humor
Wheres this from?
I completely forgot about these guys
I love studio C
Kinda ripping all of Pete Holmes’ jokes here tho 😬
Wait, I thought that one guy was gonna get stomped in Gotham by Batman, again.
lmao
This is just a rip off of a Pete Holmes skit
what show is this?
Dude did it by the books.
Is this a rip off of Pete Holmes sketch?
Who's playing batman ?
Which sitcom or movie?
hilarious.   "that's him."
This is so funny I wish I could give it more "thumps ups."
Number  three  I' am batman 😂😂😂
That guy sounds a lot like Graves from CoD
I refuse to believe that height measurement is correct.
yo soy hombre del murciélago
Is that trump?
This would be actually funny if the laugh tracks were'nt there
this is so unfunny it's ironically funny. still not funny though.
This video is 10 years old..
This reminds me of Pete Holmes impression of Batman
Not them ripping off college humor Badman
Wait, is that the great scott sterling calling the lineup?
Not Funny
😂
Batman(Average Version).
One must suffer for our pleasure
The Christopher Walken voice had me dying 😂😂😂
I stumbled upon this channel and I’m so glad I did
this channel is awesome they have made my childhood better until the new cast showed up 😑😐🙄
One of the least funny things I've seen man
_I'm_ *BATMAN*
What’s this from?
That should be in a movie or show. Batman and a criminal who doesn't speak English.  Batman: I'm Batman. Criminal: ¿Que? Batman: Yo soy hombre del murciélago.
“I’m man of the bat”
this is soooooooooooooooooooo awsome i love it
This a straight ripoff of comedy central. If I recall correctly it was "batman finds his voice".
now number five
😂 his mouth kinda looks like Trump
¿Donde esta las drogas?  Where's the drugs hobbitses? Silly silly drugs... Swear to me!
The police is a better interrogator than batman and he didn't even need violence.
He is trump
Thats Donald Trump!
Aye thats the College Humour Batman!
Never realized how much the Batman and trump have so much in common lol
i've never seen anything less funny in my life
That’s him 😂
If anyone’s interested, CollegeHumor (now called Dropout) did a Batman parody mini series a while back which is hilarious which is similar to this. Loads of videos just like this lol
I really wanted him to say "im batman" in a kid voice and the 4th guy to say it exactly like batman
Hilarious....Can't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂
He. Is. PACKIN.
“IM BATMAN” -🤠
the first "I'm Batman" caught me off guard 💀
This is a ripoff of Pete Holmes same skit 🤔
Am I the only one that thinks the third voice was a Jimmy Fallon impression.
Sounds more like Harvey Firestein 😅
Pete Holmes does it 💯 times better🙄Oh wait thats why it sounds familiar...
These laughs are fake yeah ?
If Donald Trump was Batman
Nr 4 🧍‍♂️
😅😅😅
Joker in Batman costume 😂
“Im what ever Gotham needs me to be “ 🤣😭😭
Scott sterling became a cop?
Is this Pete Holmes, or just inspired by his performance?
Cop: Number 3 step forward. Batman: I'm Bruce...
“That’s him” lololol
This is why Gordon is always keeping an eye out for him 😂😂
Usta ti ga metnem
hilarious
Rich... and nuts.
The good ol dayuss
LmfaoXD
I Plead the Fifth!!!!
Did they really think that no one has seen the Pete Holmes YouTube series?
I was expecting him to say "i am the night, i am vengeance i am batman"
Could be funnier
He just couldn’t resist..
When i close my eyes i hear Donald trump😢
The Spanish one was the best😂
Nice to see SNL steeling college humors bit
Broof
😂😂😂
😂😂😂;
Donald Trump is Batman
🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Did he do Chris Walken?  Lol
Legends say that number 4. still didn’t get his turn
Movie name plz
Did he steal this from Pete Holmes ?!
😂😂😂
That was a pretty good Barney Phyfe.
😂😂😂
me when RJ uses that funny voice and says "no, it's totally fair game, and you lost!"
Pete Holmes gonna be pissed
Just more evidence that the Nolan trilogy is bad, even in parody form
Scott sterlingggggggggggggg
Snl sucks
😂 I'm dying here
JUSTICE….. FOR GOTHAM! 😮‍💨
Bro who is that?! This shit is waaaaay too funny! The anger with "IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!!!"🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is number 2 dj peach cobbler?
Dude looks like Dennis Reynolds from the back of the head lmao
That’s him
Now that's reverse psychology
Yo soy el hombre del muriegalo
College humour did it first
This should be on in place of SNL.
Cringe
I miss the original cast... 🙂
Bro couldn’t help himself in the end. He just had to say “I’m Batman”
I was FULLY expecting the last "I'm Batman" to be another old man impression, or in Polish, or something and #4 to be the guy.
😂😂😂😂😂
I don't recall saying this
lol
😂😂
Wait he's batman
OMG 😂😂😂😂😂😂
CollegeHumor ripoff
I don't even remember when Donald Trump played Batman. Wow!
HE'S NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!   😂😂😂
Whats up with the laugh track
Nah, that's Kevin Conroy
😂😂😂
Batman sounds cool, but hombre del murcielago just sounds weird to me.😂😂😂
Watching this 100 times still can't not laugh
He sounds a little like trump
Why did I just realize Batman and trump talk the same 😭
bro i remember watching this as a kid studio c is the best i swear
He saw Leo movie.
What is this pete holmes knock off
batman is just Trump whispering aggressively
This is stolen from Pete Holmes
I'm WEAK 😂😂😂😂
Esp
That was so good, cool spin on it, the young C Walken 😂
is this supposed to be funny or….
This skit is stolen.
Comedy today: wear a stupid costume, speak in a dumb overly done voice... Gosh get creative... 🙄
Was that Eddy Burback
Is that cop the guy from Ghost Hunters??!
4th guy was so relieved that he didn’t have to say it
hey why does he sound like donald trumps? is it just me?
Donald Trump in batman suit
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The good ol days😂
"I'm Batman." "Why?" "Because I'm Batman!!!"
😂😂😂
This the equivalent to the Scott Calvin vs Santa Clause
NO IM BATMAN
Why he sounds more like Donald trump😅
Boom childhood ruin
Tbh the police officer sounds like graves from cod
Jim Carrey is so funny 😁 😅
😂😂😂 Hilarious!!!
Eddy Burback
THHeere
“Hombre del murciélago” jajajajjaja
Is that Bill Hader?
What could have possibly been the "you need to come to the station because you fit the description of a suspect" for anyone other than Batman?
What’s this from
Back in the day when Studio C was funny
Christian Bale's Batman is immortal
Basically, a Pete Holmes bit
Hes batman impression was on point 💯
Yo soy el hombre murciélago
Batman sounds like trump
Nah pretty sure it’s not the third guy. 4th guy is looking a lil sus though.
I'm Batman!
Reminded me of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 a súper Classic 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yo soy hombre de murcielago ! 😂😂😂
lmaooooo well that was unexpected 🤣🤣
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is a rip off of Pete Holmes.
LMAO, Batman's the best.
Laughed so hard i farted at the spanish one 😂
is this like SNL
Sounds just like Christian Bale Batman lol
Was this NOT Pet Holmes?!
He really tricked him into saying 😂it anyway
It's would've been better If he said I'm vengeance lol 😂😆
classic studio c hits different
This is brutally bad comedy
I've got HISHE "Because I'm Batman" flashbacks 😂
Oh my days cant stop lmao 😂😂😂😂
Whos under the mask?
Looks like we've got a fan of Pete Holmes writing this one 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
“That’s him” 😂 I’m dead
I laughed too loud and way too long on this one, my family thinks Im insane now, and it doesn’t help i fell to the floor rolling.
Stealing a Pete Holmes sketch from a decade ago  is wild
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pete Holmes needs to be in the credits
😐😐
Whats the show called?
Could not have pointed out that guy in black costume suit until he said those 2 infamous words: "I'm Batman."
This sounds more like Donald Trump than Batman 😂
I love this stuff😊
Yall really find this funny? 🤨 he's trying way to hard to be funny and it completely ruins it
That better be Pete Holmes...
Lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How can i watch more of this skit
Congratulations. You played yourself
This joke is from Pete Holmes' batman parodies on college humor I believe
I could here a little bit of trump in the batman 😂
"Im Bahhtmannn?" hahahah
Are there people who think stuff like this is actually funny?
I noticed that he sounded a bit like Trump as well.
😂😂😂
Batman when he meets Donald Trump
😂😂😂😂😂
And this is supposed to be funny?
Did this repackage Batman finds his voice or the other way around?
These were the best days of YouTube
What is movie name
And that is? 😂😂
IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!!!! Had me dead
His Christopher Walken was impeccable
😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
im hungry
Pete Holmes wants his joke back
You know the drill,makita one
I'm not wearing Hockey Pads
I'm Batman🦇🧔‍♂️
Didn't Collagehumor have this skit with Pete Holmes? The thievery
What show is this? Why is it knocked off all of Pete Holmes Best parts of his original Batman sketch? This feels like a shameless rip-off
that was not even funny at all
Trump is Batman
😂🤣😂🤣
The real jokers here are the people in the comment section who seem to think this sketch was stolen from Pete Holmes’ “Batman Chooses His Voice” just because both the sketches have Batman in them.   How in heaven’s good name is this even remotely similar to Batman trying to intimidate a drug dealer, failing cos of his ridiculous voice and then attempting to choose a tone that fits his motif? And since when did Pete Holmes obtain the monopoly on parodying Batman? I swear some people just lack all semblance of sense or nuance to appreciate good comedy.
Isn’t this just stealing Pete Holmes “bad man”
He should have just said "hello I'm batman do you need help with your taxes?"
Not funny
Who was that? And don't say batman
That’s gotta be the funniest thing I’ve seen online
This is from college humor like 10 years ago. Rip off
No not Batman a bad man 😂
"That's him!"...😂
Is this snl? Cause its not funny
TIL they made the Lamborghini Bat. 😂
I thought hes going to say donald trump because of his voice 😂
The Usual Suspects"Unusually"😅
"That's him!"😂😂😂
Pete holmes was here first
Really seals in the flavor...  like if u knew the skit...
Hahaha good one 😂
"I'm Batman." And I'm DYING. 😂😂😂😂😂
Ripping off Pete Holme's Batman parody.
Batman: want to know my secret identity?
Whaaat 😂😂😂😂
This is just great....hahaha 😂
So.. what came first; this skit or college humors? Its complete a rip off one way or the other
For some reason this reminds me of an angry Trump...
These guys stole this whole bit from college humor
They all knew he was Batman, they just needed him to say it for legal reasons 😂
And I am vengeance
never seen Christian bales audition tapes for Batman before this that’s amazing thank you 🤣
Skit sounds like the one from College Humor.
I feel like it should have ended  Batman "I'm what Gotham needs me to be."  Police Officer "and that is?"  Batman "I'm Batman."  Victim "that's him."  Batman "FUCK!"
is that bat dad?
The different Iterations and/or versions of: “I’m Batman!” Batman: I’m Batman! Bart: I’m Bartman! Mr Burns: I am Fruitbat Man! Thanos: I am inevitable! Iron Man: I am Iron Man! Spider-Man/Tom Holland: I am Spider-Man! Lost Pause: I… am… Kirito!
Gold belt?
Its sound trump to me
Man Graves went from a Police Interviewer to Shadow Company CEO
I was waiting for the last guy to go and nail it
So pretty much word for word the Pete Holmes sketch in a different setting?
😂😂😂😂😂
Where’s the funny part ?
Tell me when to laugh
Is that Christian bale?
When did scot sterling become a fed
That's him 😂
Tell me you've seen Pete Holmes without telling me.

“YOSOYELHOMBREMURCIERGALO!!“ 🤣
Christian Bale's Batman is the worst one. Yeah I said it.
Christian Bale Batman during auditions😂

The end “ that’s him”
Never thought I'd see the day...
Batman would've never fell for it.
Finally they caught this bandit!

IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS
He sounds like Trump with a really sore throat!  🤣🤣🤣
The Jewish reference is pretty weird… was Batman Jewish?
No one will ever be able to deliver the line better than Conroy. He was the Goat.  Rip.
There was only 2 white people on the line up, and JM , was not there.  The other white person was bald and short
Then show up in court, fbi.  Not me .
the annoying laugh track destroys this skit. shame
Jason is a national treasure
Gotem
Sounded like Trump at the end 😅
He sound like Pewdiepie
Reminds me of Pete homes Batman from college humor.
Yo soy Hombre del mercielago
legends tell of an SNL that is more dedicated to laughs than politics...
Bat talk 🗣️🦇
😂😂😂
😮😅😂😂😂
IM NOT Wearing HOCKEY PADS😂😂😂
Brilliant!

Prop to the other guys who kept their laugh 😂
I love how he’s a mixture of Batman and Donald Trump 😂
This dude sucks, only 1 Batman, Adam West and not these irritating drama queens..😂😂😂
haha!
When did Trump become batman?
Sounds like Donald trump 😂😂😂
I think it number one
That Christopher Walken though
anti-comedy.
What a coincidence after this short it goes to batman 😅
Ladies and gentleman we got him!!😂😂😂
"that's him" 😂
Thats trump
Ripping off pete holmes
He gave me trump vibes on the goalie line lol
Bwahahahaha
They stole this. They totally stole this bit
sounds like trump
Since when Donald trump casted Batman?
Can’t stop laughing
"now number 5" I'm sorry
Yo that’s actually probably the best Christopher walken impression I’ve ever heard😂
Dude... its amazing to think all these funny well know batman parodies with that particular voice came from Christian bale's batman movies😅
How is this at all funny
What show is this?
wth is a ghoul doing here???
😂😂😂😂😂 im not wearing hockey pads
😂he sounds like Donald Trump
😂😂😂
Did Pete Holmes steal your bit?
I did not see that coming 😂😂😂😂
Is this the same batman from that one video? "Donde estan las drogas" *Al Pacino batman*. "Where are the drugs going silly goose, silly, silly goose"??
Lol
That is fucking hilarious 😂😂😂 where did all the comedy go???
I wonder what I just saw in terms of comedy...
😂
Umm... did they rip off Badman?
What is name of show or movie?
For me it's the Keanu Reeves impersonation.
Didn't know batman2 was that great😮
I’m Batman  That’s him
how Is this suppose to be funny
Who was playing batman? Looked a little like trumps mouth
I am vengeance, I am the night, I am BATMAN!
Does Batman have a slight lisp? I feel like every impression I hear has one????
Blatant rip-off of collegehumour’s video
He was framed.
Isnt this an old college humour skit?
Clint Eastwood's Batman?
Soy hombre murciélago 😂😂😂
😐😐😐
I liked it better when Pete Holmes did it
I feel like Donald Trump hiding under the suit
collegehumour was peak
“something in the way ooooh”
I thought he was justice
In the new movie he kept saying "I'm vengeance". Yes it's just as cringy as you'd imagine it to be.
Why is Man in a line of suspects? Is he stupid?
The person playing batman stole all of the content from the badman series from college humor. Originally played by pete holmes.
YAY!
Who is he imitating after Christopher Walken? "I'm...Batman?"
Batman outsmarted by Scott Sterling and he didn't even use his face!
why is gavin newsom disguised as a good guy?
copied from pete holmes badman
You know what this reminds me of I want it that way scene from Brooklyn 99
Shuld I laught now?
This just a hack job of Badman, how batman found his voice.
Whats up with the cops neck?
Thats profiling
I heard filthy frank
What is this show??
Chills. Literal chills
He's Batman
Isn’t this from how Batman found his voice
Is this just ripped off the college humour video
The laugh track can't save this
Practically stole this.
I miss the old studio C
misdirection
I mean pete Holmes did a similar video
Thats him 😂 that one friend we have that always caps
Batman voiced by Christopher Walken :)
Sorry but seeing every suspect line up now on YT i immediately think: you are.. my fire...the one.. desire 🎵🎶
Batman doing Christoper walken caught me so off guard 😂😂
thats him had me laughing
The “IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS” got me
When did everyone stop being funny?
He sounds like Trump
"I'm Batman!"
Very similar to a scene from Brooklyn Nine Nine.
Pretty sure I saw a college humor skit of this years ago
Very Pete Holmes-esque 😬
The "I'm batmaan?"
♥
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂
I miss old studio c 🥲
The first one caught me off guard..
All I here is graves from MWII
Definitely not number 3
Terrible attempt at Christopher Walken
Batman giving Trump vibes.. 😂
Great voice acting. He had Clint Eastwood, Christopher Walken, keanu Reeves from bill and Ted, Walter Brennan from Rio bravo western.
He said it in Spanish Lmaoo😭😭😭
Lol
is this funny to people?
What show is this
"yo soy hombre de  murciélago"  got me rolling
"is that batman?"  "nO ItS hombre de  murciélago"
🤣
"you are, my fire"
He sounds like grave from MW2
😂😂😂
I half expected him to throat punch the next guy, who then chokes out a perfect "I"m batman" and gets dragged away even though actual batman is standing there in costume.
Wanna know how Superman would have handled the situation? Batman: "No!"
😂 mate say "yo soy el hombre del murcielago" it's like say " I am the bat of man"
how is this not Pete Holmes?
Straight up stolen from Pete Holmes
....the Christopher Walken BATMAN.
What episode is this? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That Christopher walken one 😂😂😂
I would have started laughing on the floor when he made the Spongebob impression
Sounds like Trump the presidente man😂😂😂😂
Too real! I had a dude break in to a gym I worked at dressed like Batman. All he said was “in Batman” took an hour for the cops to show. By then he jumped the fence & beat up a women around the corner…
I. Not wearing hockey pants 🤬🤬👹👹💀💀☠️☠️😊
Hombre del murciélago, el mejor super héroe que haya existido
Pretty sure they can't force you to testify against yourself. I think I read that somewhere once
Well that explains why he drove a Murcielago in TDK
This whole skit is literally jacked from college humours Batman finding his voice video
😂
We really have experiments being done on the psyches of citizens. How else can the mass delusion of the past decades from one thing to another be explained? It's like priming citizens to see how far they can be pushed. Do you think we can take their children away? Do you think we can force them to not go to work? Do you think we can force them to obey with no recourse and no discussion? I would love to be in those meetings.
How many citizens were at the meeting? One? Just shows how decrepit our society is. People don't even have the wherewithal or the time to attend to the governance of their own lives. You can't even find that in a novel.
What's on the back of his neck?
Is that batdad?
You all know the drill 😅😅😅😅
He sounds more like Bruce Wayne.  Did they get the right guy?
😂😂😂😂😂
Totally accurate 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Who is this?! That christopher walkin impression was spot on
Wait, he's Batman?
He sounds like donald trump
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
That best be Pete Holmes
What’s up with the Bat Bulge? Ate those the jewels Catwoman’s trying to steal?!
Omg the Ezra Miller "he's batman?" Fucking killed me
this is funny.  what show is this
LOL 🤣🤣🤣
Is that Commander Phillip Graves?
The birth of BADMAN!!!! College humor made such a great character
at least he tried to cover his real voice😅
This isn t a Batman impression, it s a Pete Holmes imitating batman imitation....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was this supposed to be funny?
The first I'm Batman caught me off guard.
What is this?
This is basically the same as the “Batman chooses his voice” video
I am the menace that flaps thru the night
I think it’s supposed to be “ I want it that way”
The Christopher Walken impression of "I Am Batman" was top notch
Tdk jokes never get old😂
Snl made something funny?
This was a good chuckle.
Name of show
Dead ass batman
😭😭
😆
I'm Batman
This is a stolen sketch idea snl sucks, college humor did this basically a decade+ ago
Laaawwd when is this from😂😂😂
These are just Pete Holmes impressions, hes ripping off Pete Holmes Batman.
When he talked like Christopher Walken that shit sent me
"first I was a man, now I am a bat"
Why does he sound like Trump with a sore throat?
hes copying the badman guy....and hes nowhere near as funny....word for word he copied badmans routine...gotta steal someone elses idea and didnt even make it better
Thats him😅
why did man get arrested? is he stupid?
this is really similar to the Pete Holmes college humor batman video where he finds his voice.
Fantastic underrated game. They need to make another one.
Tell me whaahee!
“Ahoy spongeboy mebob I injected ketamine into me blood stream!” Mr krabs said calmly
Laugh track ruins it
sooooo funny... in some other universe
I didnt think it was going to get me, but it did.
🤣
😂😂😂
It was the Christopher Walken voice for me… 😂😂
Like Batman would be in a lineup😂 smoke bomb I’m Batman disappearing act😂
reddit humour
I now see why Batman and Joker truly got had a great relationship.
This was extreme cringe
Yeah this is just a rip off of Pete Holmes "Badman" sketches.  Like almost word for word
What’s this from?
This is a cheap recreation of College Humor's video.
Him speaking Spanish killed me 💀
“I’m Batman”🤠 To “I’m Batman”👴🏻
Now number 5
Got him
College humor ripoff??
More than a goalie? What about Scott Sterling?
Still not convincing enough to me I still think it’s number 1
Stolen content from Pete Holmes
Do y'all remember when studio C was good?
I know ALOT of people did parody Bale Batman, but why does this feel like it's ripping off Pete Holmes?😂😂
3gɓp    ,  jfkooooptptotofc .ĝť2😢2😢😮2😮😮😮😮😮the 😂😮😮😮😮😢
If yall haven't seen sudio c its understandable but they are funny when it comes to this. but not the new cast there not funny as much

He’s literally in a suit bro 😂😂
I am...                 Flying fox person.
I am batbale
Is this Pete Holmes? If is not he totally ripped him
Literally copied the old college humor video
I'm Batman 🦇
I was expecting the last guy to say it in the deep voice lol
And even with all his voice acting, he still has the lisping "ths" of GEN Z.
Lol just blatantly stealing college humor gags
What’s the name!?
Hahaha😂
Is that Pete Holmes playing Batman? Pete usually does a much better job than this, and if that’s not him then this is a very blatant rip off. They even stole the Spanish Batman joke
It cant just be me that thinks he sounds like trump.
neebs?
Wtf was that jajjja
I remember the first time I watched this praying to myself that he'd say "I want it that way"
If finally fold and he said it😂😂😂😂😂
This is like the college humor skit and I love it
My throat hurts just from watching him make the voice 😂
Clearly its donald Trump
Wasnt this College Humors bit? With this batman
"That's him" 💀
Who was the actor playing Batman here? That guy was funny but all those impressions were on point!
Bro why does the guy asking questions sound like Phillip graves
It was so funny when he said I’m not wearing Hockey pads 😂😂😂😊❤
We just gonna pretend y’all didn’t steal this from college humor?
That's Fruitbat Man.
sounds like trump
Is that Pete Holmes aka Badman?
There! 😂
This is Jim carry?
I was hoping for: Some call me detective  Some call me the caped crusader  I am vengeance  I am the night  I…am…BATMAN!
Studio c is great
Wasn't this a Pete Holmes video at one time. Am I missing something?
Imagine batsis yn showing this to the league and entire family 😂
I was hoping he would say the hockey pads line 😂
show name
Hahaha 😂
The old crazy prospector one got me I found gold in dem dere hills hehehe
They used collegehumor’s Batman. Best crossover ever :D
The guy to the right of batman is trying not laugh so hard.
snl is wildly unfunny
That guy sounds nothing like Batman... -.-
Missed studio c
“Alright that’s him”😂
This would have been funny 10 years ago.
But number 5 who killed her brother
Pete Holmes is my Batman 😂😂😂
The guy asking looks like Linus tech tips
What is on the back of that guy's neck?
Not funny to be honest.
Somebody get Pete Holmes on the line
Brunos Diaz señor Batman
Hahahahahahahaha!!!! Omg! Stop! Hahahahahahaha! I can’t take it!!!! Hahahahahahaha! He’s dressed as Batman, but they still don’t know that he’s Batman!!!! Hahahahaha!
No I’m Batman
That’s trump
Didnt Pete Holmes do this exact bit like a decade ago on Collegehumour?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Laugh tracks are so cheap and unfunny
Why do it sound like Donald Trump
This was not even slightly funny
Is that Pete Holmes?
Playoff from college humor skits
now number 5
as soon as i saw this was Studio C, instant like XD
That was funnyyyyyyyyy😂😂
Is Batman Trump?
Batman when he sees the joker:😁😊 Batman when he sees a old lady jay walk:😈👹😈
The Christopher Walken impression is everything 😂
pop culture garbage
Why does he sound like Donald Trump😂
Where is the funny.
A big Ego is Batman's only weakness.
Welp gi have alot open map chest and side quest if gi have free 10 pull like hsr then that maybe too much. Hsr no open map and each map just have around 10 chest so they have to give to player more pull some how.
Why does homie sound like a raspy Donald Trump?
bro that's not batman thats trump in his goth arc 💀💀💀💀
Ayo that's me fr
Lost it when he spoke Spanish 😂😂😂
donald trump in a batman costume
I’m Batman
I want that to be Keanu Reeves so bad..
"thats him"😂
Wait, he's Batman?
I am whatever Gotham needs me to be casual monolog the cop playing into it and that is ?
2nd one sound like christopher walken
The Christopher Walken one is my favorite
Is it Niel Patrick Harris 😂😂
That’s him
If I got pulled in to say I’m Batman, I’m definitely doing the deep out of breath “I’M BATMAN!” 😂
Did this or the college humor badman sketch come out first? Because one stole from the other
"Which is"?  "The dark knight"!  I think would've been funny
Brah this is not funny im sorry guys
😂😂😂😂
Nu do they not see that that is him like that is crazy but he got mad and funny
😂😂😂😂
Pete Holmes did it better
Why does batman sound like donald trump?? Am i missing something?
Lol
Is this Jim Carey?
Lol "I'm BAt Man"
This bit is completely ripped from Pete Holmes and CollegeHumor’s Badman.
He ruined barman for me
batman is a product of generational wealth. he's no one. just like the top 1%.
Juicyfruitsnacks energy
bizarrely, I'm getting Trump from this - funny!
Total rip off of Pete Holmes’s sketch
Ismt this just a rip off of the College Humor batman?
Blud became Peter griffin😂
Glad to see the old college humor skit got a refresh 😂
😐😐😐
😅😂😂
Is this supposed to be funny?
Batman Griffin😂
Total ripoff of Pete Holmes. Y’all should be ashamed.
Why did he scream at him for saying he’s wearing hockey pads tho😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Someone owes Pete Holmes some royalties
No way people find this funny.
Ah a Pete Holmes rip off.
A
Just a stolen joke from the internet
Stealing Collegehumor
pete holmes
This was funny when Pete Holmes did it years ago!
how is this funny
I prefer superman. Superman saves the world and trouble is around every corner. Batman only saves 1 town.  Funny vid though.  I like it.
What show is this
Which SNL is this?
I love that he doesn’t correct that he is a lunatic but does correct the hockey pads
Just stealing from Pete Holmes and CollegeHumor huh?
Literally just the college humor skit  Down to the Malkovich voice
"yo soy hombre del murciélago"   that was so random omg. killed me 💀
if trump was Batman 🤣
I love this one! I’ve seen it maybe a dozen or so times now and I still grin like an idiot. 😂
My dad is a huge fan of batman so this one made him laugh so hard 😂
That's not Batman, that guy is Scott Sterling.
More or less a stolen video idea.
When you get trickdd
That moment when I saw him. And he said, "number three, repeat the phrase please" killed me! 😂😂😂Shoot I have watched this in a loop for about 20 times now. And it's like I am still watching it for the first time. 😂😂😂
Lol, "studio c' is so dope
Batman finally got outsmarted 😂
Scope shot???
If that's not Pete Holmes playing Batman they're totally ripping him off
Imagine Trump doing the Batman voice
Lmaoo
Well that wasn’t very funny
Which show is this
This is so great. 😂
The Christopher Walkens impression was great
This was done years ago
I'm sorry but this lineup wouldn't hold everybody else should be in Batman costumes
Its a me batmatman
Dude is funny
😂😂😂😂
Who has this humor
Did this come out after the Badman CH video? If so... Oof
🤣🤣🤣👊👊
This feels waaaaay too close to college humour/dropout's batman.
Stole this from Pete Holmes
Different set up to Pete Holmes' sketch but pretty sussy how similar it is other than that.
I'm batman That's him
I am ironman😎
the patch job on the human suite is bad.
Dying
Who paid to make this sketch happen?
😂😂😂😂
i miss old Studio C
I like the Christopher Walken version
i was expecting number 4 to do a perfect batman voice
Ha ha ha it’s so funny because it subverts the expectation that he not only is Batman, but will say it with the iconic inflections - but then they hit you with a voice that sounds nothing like Batman! It’s… genius! I am literally rolling on the floor laughing
What's this from?  It's hilarious!
Trump in a Batsuit, Bat 'The Trump" man.
The good old days where I use to laugh at their skits
😂
He's Rorshak pretending to be Batman
“That’s him.” Got em😂
Lmao what's this from?🤣🤣🤣
Jeg er Batman
Good sketch but the camera is jarring at least in this shorts sized video.
Not Christopher Walkin 😂😂😂😂
What show is this?
Stolen from Pete Holmes
Not a big fan of the new cast recycling these old sketches. Sure, they’re pure gold and the new cast is nowhere near their level. But doing it just for the clicks seems cheap.
I'm Batman? 🤔😲
Old ManMgucket!
Honestly didn't think it was that good at first but had me rolling by the end. Well done!
So...literally the Pete Holmes skits? Cool.
Is that Scott Sterling giving Batman the lineup?
Who’s in the costume
how the F Batman got caught!?
Jocker accidently wearing batman suit
Why he sound like trump
SENOR DE LA NOCHEEE
Lol
😂😂😂
The calmness of the police gets me 😂
Nice Hockey Pads reference
Given how old it is at this point, I have to wonder just how many people don't know about the Badman series that the youtube channel 'Dropout' (formerly known as CollageHumor) made.
I don’t know how the guys beside him aren’t laughing. I probably would have been fired for laughing too much 😂😂😂
"fine👹. I'm batman 🥸🤓"
The spanish in the Batman voice had me dying.
I thought during one of his one his impressions one of the guards would say that sounds like Bruce Wayne
he sounded like an old prosepector
#1 rivers cuomo of weezer?!!?
Wait a minute...isn't this the guy who did all those "BatDad" videos years ago?  Sounds exactly like him.
Honestly it wasn’t even funny
I'm BATMAN (OO ) (OO) ( OO)!!!???!! So much for DC Comic and Marvel Comic non talented acting profiling for federal agents to explore!
This is brilliant!
Oh dangit, I said it
Sauce
Justice
He sounds like Donald Trump in some parts
Did collage humor and Pete holms take this from this show? Or did this show take this from collage humor and Pete Holmes?
And that is how you regurgitate something Pete Holmes did first and better.
College humor already did this
All I hear is a bad trump impression
Haha get it! He says he's batman, but NOT in the batman voice! Ayhuck, ayhuck, ahyuck. 😂😂😂 what _comedy_ in 2023 we have.
#4 is like, am I ever going to get my turn?
Me when my mom asks me to apologize
I love old studio C
Ow jolly I'm batman cable said who u I said I batman
the audacity on some managers is going on and forth to the end of the week lol
Stolen bit
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m not wearing hockey pads runs into my field hockey cage and throws a goalie back at him. You are now a scary marshmallow.
🤣
The collage humour references lmao
lets pretend that Pete Holmes didnt do this exact same skit where batman chooses his voice
funny he sounds like Trump
Batman and Scott sterling. The crossover we never knew we needed
This is just ripping off the CollegeHumor Pete Holmes character
He sounds like Donald trump.
I died to Spanish one
So we just stealing from Pete Holmes now?
Film name?
Ahhhh… old studio c I miss you
The only one to ever outsmart Batman
Im bat man....
Linda Sounds Like Trump...
Number 4 dodged a bullet with this one
Wow this really sent me back to the good old days 😂
Gotcha, Batman! 👈🏻
Real humor
What is this from 😂😂😂
SCOTT STERLING
i think that’s weird al yankovic 😂
Is that bat dad? Please tell me it isn’t lol
Number 4 never stood a chance.
Kinda a college humor ripoff but the line in Spanish is funny as shit
Pretty sure it's 'I'm whatever Gotham DESERVES me to be' instead.
Hey, i got question to all cod maniacs. Isn't that guy who ask them to say I AM BATMAN the same voice actor for Graves from mw2?
Yoda mmmmhhh batman I am
Personally I think Brooklyn 9-9 did their joke that was like this but without Batman better
😑🙄
I liked it the first time when Pete Holmes did it.
Snl has lost touch
I miss the old studio c 😭
STUDIO C!!!!!
This era of studio c was peak, not trying to diss any of the new cast members, but this group was one of the few comedy sketch groups that I like
Isn't this just a copy of Pete Holmes?
The old days
what a throwback
Pete Holmes needs to be Batman
Would have been great if they had "That's him!" Then say thanks to the rest of you guys in the line up and see them walking away with Christian Bale or Ben Affleck as no.5
Pete Holmes did this better.
I don't think it's him, but he sounds an awful lot like Bad Man from the College Humor videos.
He sounds like Trump 😂😂
For since reason while he was doing his Batman impression all I could think about was   "Would you intercept me? I'd intercept me."  Anyone who gets that reference will have a cool pillow when they sleep tonight
Pete Holmes anyone?
That’s him
But Harvey Dent, can we trust him?
Why does the guy sounds like philip grave
That’s funny
man i miss the cast
Yo soy hombe del murcielago!
Stole this from college humor
I love how in the end, as soon as he was distracted it erupted out of him😂
Genius 😂😂
That him
I have proof batman sucks. He was so jobless he added ears to his suit
That's him 😂🤣🤣🤣
funniest shit i’ve seen in a while
Dude just sounds like a ghoul from fallout
Where i find more
Is that dj peach cobbler?
I miss old studio c😭
Lmfao
Why he sound like trump?
LOL very classic LOL😊
Great Christian Bale impersonation with underbite and lisp 😂
that locomotive is a Kerr Stuarr Tattoo class
This is a rip from a college humor sketch
Nice clean humor loved the skit good job!!
Am o the onely one that see batman with no eyes
Too funny!
WHERES RACHEL
Pete Holmes' Batman is so hilarious
¡¡¡No, soy Batman!!!
That is not the usual suspects
Good thing it wasn't Adam West......he never had to tell anyone he was Batman. He just showed up and everyone knew who he was.
Not Pete Holmes at Batman.
Perché io sono Uomo Pipistrello
Fine but where is “Scott Sterling”?
Chat was packing
I need a shirt that says I’m Batman in Spanish
The way they all just look so irritated with him 😂
I think a little bit of golem slipped out of him
Ripped off Pete Holmes skit
Why... Is there a 3' line? What kind of child is commiting felonies??
Sounds like Donald Trump with strep throat
Was that supposed to be funny? Small minds are easily pleased
That second one had chistapha walkin all upin it
😂 loved it
Pete Holmes inspired…? Almost the same
I hated the episode where he beat up an old lady for jaywalking
this is like that funny pete holmes batman bit, but if it were done by canadians
JUsTice fOR gOThaM
Is this supposed to be funny?🤔
Funny😂
Who is playing Batman here?
Huh sounds a lot like college humor
So funny but you can't outsmart batman
The amount of relief when he let out the catch phrase at the end tho, "im batman"🫡😭
I am 100% not Bruce Wayne 🤘
the last guy just wonder why he even there at all 😂
Which show
This is comedy? 😐
They took this like whole bit from college humors badman series specifically the trying new voices episode
YO SOY HOMBRE DEL MURCIELAGO 😂
Donald Trump??
I miss them bro😢
“im whatever Gotham needs me to be” except if they need you to move your neck
😂😂😂
I miss this 😭
Him: “I’m Batman?”  Me: 💀😂💀😂(cough cough)😂💀😂💀💀😂💀😂😂💀😂
I love the old studio c cast 😂
Sounds like Trump
This is awesome 😂😂😂
“tHerRReE” KILLED ME
... I think it's number 2
Rip off of collage humor
Batman just did a Christopher Walken impression.
“Can you please sing the lyrics to I want it that way?”
It sounds like the “badman” sketch from college humor back in the day
Am I the only one who heard Magic Man from Adventure Time.
So ehh... was this before or after college humor did Badman cause the dialogue is way to similar
If it wasn’t for the laughtrack you wouldn’t know this was supposed to be humouring
This is too funny!
Bro i thought no one else watched this😭😭
I hate the Christian Bale Batman voice.
bro really brought out his Joe Swanson voice for the im not wearing hockey pads one
Ladies and Gentleman, we got him...
What's on your neck?
He's every Batman in one.
What a coincidence, so am I
he's totally not Bruce Wayne
Do you even need him to say it? He’s literally dressed like Batman
Am I the only one that thinks he sounds like Trump
Yes😎
I plead the 5th
"You are, my fire..." "Number 2"
Now number 5
Batman will come to rescue him
Is this a “borrowed” joke from that collegehumor sketch?
Does Pete Holmes know he’s out doing this?
Back when studio C was funny
They stole this
Bruce has been drinking tonight
This a rip off of a Pete Holmes skit
Studio c made up a lot of my childhood, this brings back memories
Gotham… chess
They can be funny when they really try
It's not 3 it's 4
Ok but I wasn’t lookin intentionally, but like why bats, bat tryna fly
The Christopher Walken impression was great😂
Is that Pete Holmes?
That was a good Harvey Dent impression.
He sounds like the Axel Braun version
That was unexpected
Different setting, but this is a just like Pete Holmes Bad-Man finds his voice.
Then he paid them all off because he's bat man 😂😂😂
Are these guys just ripping off Pete Homes? Because he did this material years ago.
😂😂😂😂
If it wasn't for the weird voices you'd assume Clint Eastwood was under there
Didn't Pete Holmes do this?
😂😂😂
I’m batman
There's two versions of batman. Incredibly intelligent and resourceful. Or just resourceful lmao
Way to steal a bit from pete holmes
When i like it turne from 111k to 112k. Yyeessss!!!!!!
I for real thought he would say it then just "next" and the other guy would be the crimonal
Casey Jones was the lunatic in goalie pads.😂😂😂😂
Ok, that's damn funny....
I don't speak English is perfect for this😂😂😂
Is that Pete Holmes? Sure sounds like him.
He had me rollin when he switched it up to spanish 🤣
Giving Shadow the Hedgehog vibes.
So where can I find this whole skit at?
Bro sounds like Clint Eastwood
Didn’t collegehumor do this with a different setup?
Stolen from Pete Holmes Badman series
I really miss old studio c, does anybody know why they left?
What the fuck is this.
Batman sucks
Batman displaying one of his many skills…voice mimicry
He sounds more like Trump than batman to me😂… especially the lips😅😅😅
They stole this skit from Pete Holmes
The last one, he pictured himself fighting crime!
Did pete holmes do it first?
This feels stolen from college humor
Pete holmes did this already.
What’s on the back of the cops neck?
So this supposed to be funny or…?
No you sound like that elongated man from the flash dressed up as a batman😂
Batman is literally Batman in Spanish you didn’t need to say “bat” in Spanish
That's a setup
He might actually be batman. And if he isn't he needs to be the next batman
feels like that scene from brooklyn 99 the song scene
I’m Batman🎉❤😮😊
"Im batman" sounded like trump lol 😆
This had me DEAD. 🤣🤣🤣
Love Jason’s voices!!!!
Omg they’re BACK I loved these guys before the whole rehaul
“That’s him!”   Batman: “Fuck”
I just got it, Batman is Donald trump
“I am Christopher Walken”
Soy el hombre morcielago.
Im scott sterling
College Humour Batman finding his voice
I love studio c!!
lol him speaking spanish makes me think of fluffy's joke where he talks about joker riddler and batman being mexican gang member names
U needed to ask.? 😂🤣🤣
"IM NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS" 🤣🤣 I CANT
Someone saw Pete Holmes' Batman alternate voices video...
I like how the cop knows exactly how to get under Batmans skin
Wait they stole this bit from college humor
Christopher walken batman 😂😂hahaha
When did this originally come out, Pete Holmes has an almost identical joke from like 10 years ago
I'd love to see Christopher Walken to be batman
College Humo4?!?
😂😂😂loved this skit😮
😐😐😐
I didn't even crack a smile until that last "im batman" 😂
Officer has been asking the wrong questions. All you need to do is just to ask a “why” question.
They still waited for him to say it for confirmation😂😂
Fun fact what Batman said in Spanish translates to I’m a bat man
What’s this from
That aint batman thats datman
Seems like a pretty blatant ripoff of Pete Holmes, but...there we are.
Aaaand that is?  “I’M BATMAN” 🦇
Batman was trump all along 😂😂
Is that patty the bail bonds guy who thinks he’s real law enforcement
So just steal the whole premise of the Pete Holmes bit, where he does different batman voices, got it
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be!
Is this stolen from Pete Holmes?  He did a nearly identical bit like 12 years ago.  Same Ray Romano and Christopher Walken impression and everything.
Was that Pete Holmes in costume again? Is he part of Studio C now? Or is Studio C the former College Humor folk?
Brilliant move. With Matt facing away from the audience, we can't see him break character. ;)
This reminds me of the Santa Clause when he is saying all the different names for Santa around the world instead of Scott Calvin
More sounded like donald trump
a blast from the past. I miss the old studio c
I am Bateman
😂😂😂😂
Literally me
Have you ever noticed that bat man is just superhero trump they talk very similarly
The Spanish one 😂😂😂😂😂
0:47 Wdym?
I’m Batman
Love that Ezra Miller impression.  "I'm Batman?"  Edit: Since this has too many likes, and some people seem confused, I'm referring to the high pitched, almost questioning tone, "I'm batman?" Which sounds very similar to when Ezra Miller, in the flop of a film Flash, said, "Wait, he's batman?" I hate to overexplain a joke, but I must also explain that I have a massive distain towards Ezra, and only enjoy the line because of how awful it is.
The mormon channel has some bangers
Yo soy Hombre de Murcielago is great
Hockey
this is the first short ive seen from studio c
Feel like Dean Winchester should be in this lineup 😂
is that mat meese
K. Back up a sec. How did they get him in there? Lol.
So so cringe
😂😂😂 g
It reminds me College humor's Badman.
“I’M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!!” - took me out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"That's him." 🤣
Christopher Walkin is such a lame actor. It was fun to see him joked on 😂
I miss when Studio C was good, bring the old cast back pls.
I miss these guys
If Studio C replies to this I will finally subscribe
😂😂
Miss the old cast😢
That was a classic video
Pete Holmes did it better
He should have done the Bisque Guy voice😂😂😂
All these years later and I still quote this. It's hilarious
Jason's batman is my fav batman, followed by Lego batman :)
The casual Christopher Walken impression 😅
Why is the back of Matt's neck so shiny?
So is Jason going to more Batman sketches, or is that behind him?
Great stuff
Ahh the old Studio C... some of the best days
I am the man of bats!😂😂😂
*I’m Batman.*
