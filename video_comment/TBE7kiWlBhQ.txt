Ok I got the build! You can delete this now
Still using this build to this day with 88 speed on cap breakers and it’s nasty on DEFENSE
It didn’t even let me get close to those attributes lol
Which badge to use for season 2 ? I have none available atm
Can you show me about this build please im trying to get it to its full potential and for some reason i have dont have the baseline reverse off one
Imagine making a LeBron build and putting him 193 pounds 😂😂🤡
Yo could you help me out? I made this build bc you the goat and I’ve finally have gotten 5 cap breakers but I have no Idea where to put them other then the 1 I put on dunk for a 93
Best motion style for offense?
Just upgraded this and it’s ass guys don’t waste your Vc
where do you put the capbreakers
@joeknows can you say which is the best specialization for this build
Motion style
What takeover?
My dream is to see a youtuber go crazy with my builds i  literally am the best 2k builder on 2k .. I stand on that .. I got a build that will not only lock this build up but is all around better and more complete no disrespect to JOE KNOWS
This was my first build and its actually pretty good I can contest hella 7,1
Can I have an update on this build
Is the build still valid if I did finishing build specialisation for legend aerial wizard and posterizer and I use 2 caps on middy to still get legend set shot
What takeover
It’s not letting me equip posterizer on my plus 2
Joe, Im on verge of getting posterizer on gold, but it doesnt show up for max +2 slot. And i did everything shown in video unless because its not gold yet maybe that is why its not showing up for the tier yet? Did it do the same for you?
When u dropping the kd update? I wanna know where I should put my cap breakers pls drop the video
I can have every badge and still miss
where should I put my cap breakers?
what’s motion style
Make this build for 5v5
Yo Joe where r u putting ur cap breakers from rookie 5/ other rep cap breakers
Can we get an update on this build?
Make lebrom that skinny is crazy cmon bro
What would you put your s1 badge elevator?
Badge elevator??
I tweaked it a bit! Is a 70 strength valid?
Motion style for the 6’8?
Which badge elevator did he choose for season 1?
Is it possible to use this build in rec, friends?
Est ce qu’il est possible d’utiliser ce build en rec MR joe ?
For some reason I don’t see the posterizer in the badge max +2
As a new 2k player, I need guidance on how to proceed. I'm 93 OVR, have all my animations right, but he never told us the end build for badges... I'm Season lvl 25 so far so I have the next 2 badge spots and I know he said what he had was temporary for now, but what is the final build on badges in slots and all?
If this is for the park why the 77 free throw?
What should the build specialization be for this?
So Where should i put the cap breakers in what ist the best Solution?
What is the build specialization for this?
what badge should i elevate to 2 levels ??? anyone got a suggestion thanks !!!
Build specialization?
Which attributes should I put my capbreakers on??
I need help dribbling
2:17, 5:08 capbreakers
this build is actually super similar to my first build and I didn’t even see this video so that makes me feel pretty good😂I did go for higher block and higher middy tho
what build specialization are you using? please!
Yooo do they have the Miami heat LeBron James jersey ? If so which store ? In 2k
What would you use your cap breakers on? Should I use a regular cap breaker in finishing even though my build specialization gives me finishing only cap breakers? Gonna be a while before I get those though
what badge elevator should i use
So i play more Rec than park is this still a good Build?
The first build I made in 2k26.
I just can’t anymore. I want nothing more than to love nba 2K. But I just can’t. Same game. Costs SO much since you both have to but the game AND vc. And now this. You can’t even create good players anymore. No diss to Joe…He did what he could with what he had. But a 193lbs LeBron build with layup in the High 70’s and Lie strength and passing is just not it. I’m out. Maybe I Will but next years 2K. Probably not though.
Joe what’re you running on your badge elevator +2 for season 1?
What’s the best specialization to use on this build?
Does anything change if I put this exact build at the SG
Why the 60 steal only get +1 cap breakers
Where should I put my cap breakers after the one in driving dunk and mid range
Where should I put my cap breakers?
3 regular cap breakers, what should I put them on?
Can I play this build in 5s?
Appreciate it Joe I personally went 84 shot close 90 layup 92 dunk I will be watching you and how you build this year⭐️💯
Joe you get me up at night with ts
What build specialization ?
this dont even have shades of bron
What about the badge elevator
Yoo I gotta crew. We got 8 people and we’re level 10. Won’t kick anybody, looking to fill it up to 50. If you’re interested join us at ROCKTOWN PEBBLE
I did the build and I swear yall move faster than me
Why I got a 80 ball and I can’t shoot my miter is very small ?
After update I can’t get attributes exactly like the video
Can I use this in rec
If you have the gameplay animation, I am a taker :)
What Build Speciallation should i use ?
what base did you switch to
Bro move your camera so we can see!
I get it supposed to be a park build but a 70s layup is criminal on a LeBron build
the nba commentators edit is so crazy 🔥🔥
What’s the takeover that is glitchy?? I can’t remember and/or find the timestamp in the vid.
why can’t i put a badge max +2 on my posterizer? I have it fully maxed at gold after putting my cap breaker to get a 93 driving dunk
What is his build specialization?
My lebron build is better
What about badge elevators?
is it shooting or dunking specialization?
what do we put for cap breakers
I accidentally put my specialization on finishing did I ruin the build?
What build specialization did you do?
hi Joe.  But What Animation use for "Motion Styles"??
Rip McLeod
If anyone needs a crew to join, feel free to join ours (search “What the Sikma”)
KD gamplay bro 🥇
What build specialization did you choose
Can’t see the jump shot ?
how do you make it a 3pt slasher instead of paint protector
HOW DO U GET A MAX +2?
Why don't I get those shades?
I can’t put any badges in the plus 2s idk why
What build specialization??
So how difficult is it to get to grind to level 40 every season since I’m not tryna spend that much money?
What specialization did you choose
Do you get steals ?
Is there anyway I get add more speed
I can’t find the Tracy mcgrady size up lol
What is the jump shot animation?
Which motion style are you using?
Saluut tout le monde ! C’est un build d’ailier ?
xQMOO used this build and the build is horrible…
What motion styles do you think are elite?
Man I be in the theater be wide open for the dunk nk sells me keeps the ball just to get blocked
Motion style?
What is this jump shot base?
what will the cap breakers look like on 3pt?
Should I bother trying to increase my steal rating into the 70’s to get silver interceptor
LEBRONNNNNNN!!!!!!!
What spcalst u pick
What would you sacrifice for higher pass accuracy?
You can delete this now
joe what badge you use for +2 badge elevator?
Where did you put the CB?
Which jumpshot are you using ?
what build specialization do we use on this
L like count, keep going buddy
What motion style do you use?
The matt ryan is cool and all but yeah that release height is lackin
wat did he pick for build special?
lebrons bout to retire in a year y'all, im not ready at all, and great video joe
What did you put your initial attributes to at 85?
Yo Joe the code don’t work on labs. Ijs
Why is everybody using mike wang in they jumpshot it must be decent
Can you make a 30 minute video of what you do in the beginning? Those are fire
who’s motion style you got
Best jump shot for this build?
Big fan brotha! One thing that stopping me is no post control at all😢
Whats the build specialization
What’s the jumper bro?
I did this and I don’t see the blur takeover
This build kinda weak tbh. Lebron has more def rebound forsure. and your mid don’t have to be that high. Also his pass acc should be an 85. He could lose a little perimeter (it’s not like he’s guarding guards) yeah L Joe
Says no weaknesses but on the report it showed weaknesses
KD build next
Game just game out the real update hasn't hit yet lol fuck all these builds till the real gameplay come out
i made the shooting guard version of this. does it change the takeover and or cap upgrades ?
I’m just waiting on the pro am guard build like I do every year 😂
I can’t even make this smh
LeBron pro am gameplay coming back😳😳
Everybody gotta remember, Joe has LEGENDARY posterizer. So don’t go thinking that silver or gold is doing what he is doing or that the dunk meter is what it is for him for everybody. You prolly need at least legend and HOF
You need a bigger frame Joe for that Durant jersey
Patently waiting on the annual Bill Russell undersized center build
When I buy the game I’m making a lebron build or a KD build and ima grind my career untill I’m a 95
Show how much ya attributes go up with the cap breaker
This is not a real LeBron James built
Hey Joe why is no one talking about takeover tokens? It gives you the ability to unlock any take no matter your rating.
How many cap breaker you will using on this build
I made a Lebron PG at 6 '7 pretty close to this one but in pg
İs this build good
the clips with matching commentating will always be tuff
My 2-way skilled pick and popper Build broken
I been a big fan of his LeBron builds since 2020 when I first started playing 2k and I highly appreciate this
This will be first build thanks Joe
Fire
Don't specialize Defense its impossible 😂😂
y’all keep asking “what specialization” the man said shooting in the video lol to bump the 87 mid to 89 for gold set shot, gosh molly guys pay attention 🤣
If I go 85 pass acc what should I take out?
the og introooo!!
If anyone is looking for a crew join mine -Clobberin Time
What's the increase in attributes if you use cap breakers on layups for this build?
Cant u get blur takeover with 85 ball handle and 75 swb?
What build specification should we use?
Wow how is the interior d still good at 60
Bro, I’ve made a clamp thief build. This one is gonna be my 2nd one though, need something to start, more offensive wise
Also, let's call a spade a spade. This build in regular hands isn't Crazy Crazy. This build in Joe's hands is super crazy !Solute 🫡
Nvm I did exactly what you said not to thank you
What build specialization are you gonna use
What happens if you put your build specialization onto finishing
so thankful for joe man🙏🏽
Thats zen im report his 💩
Don’t pay for 2K Labs. They don’t have a single jumpshot on there for 2K26 rn. It’s all old jumpers from 2K25 that aren’t even available anymore due many players releases and bases being currently locked.
74  stretch big ??
What is he doing his specialization in?
Why people create 6’8 instaed of 6’9 you got the same animation and keep the 75 swb,
Ngl double H build is like this but better
They updated the 2k lab for 2k26 already ?
the most important question how much vc do we have to spent to make a 99 ovr build this year?????
Is good timing enough or there is no way you can on ball steal with 60?
Joe I gotta question. Why won’t it let me use badge max +2 from season rewards for my tier 2 badges? Trying to upgrade lightning launch and it says there’s no badges available
Made a few changes and it’s called 2-way mid paint point forward
🔥🔥
What’s the motion style
Penny Hardaway spin been good for about 4 or 5 2ks fr
Drop the face tut
I have a 88 perimeter defense will cap break for gold on ball, 85 speed, 80 agility, 90 driving dunk will cap break, 85 pass, 81 handle, 75 SWB, 80 lay up for that physical finisher
Damn our builds are similar and I didn’t even watch your video til now
Gonna make this as my second build
Joe already has his statue outside of Park on day one. Nice, if that’s not proof of who’s the Park’s Goat, I don’t know what is
How do you feel about 51 Standing Dunk, 85 Pass acc, 72 Off Board, 57 D board?
Yo Joe, do you know if for each build you have to re-earn cap breakers from build specialisation or can they auto be added if it’s the same genre?
How many total max + badges do we get? (+1,+2)     1 each?  2 each? 3? 4 im so confused
BEEN WAITING ON DIS
Joe I’m so confused, we made an 83 3 ball but for that jumper you need an 86 3 ball??
With this build, what badge specialisation would you do? Shooting?
You gotta move your camera gang i can't see shit
I used this as a template and omgggg watch out
Ronnie 2K knowingly denies Jesus Christ. Donavon Mouton is Jesus Christ! He is the only way to Heaven! Save yourselves!!! Please!!!!
need a college degree to make a build in 2k25 nevermind this year with the 25 cap breakers lol
Quentin grimes base thank me later
joe please make a 6,2 demigod build I'ma need it before september 5th 🙏🙏🙏
More Life Love & Blessings, God bless🙏🏼✝️❤️♾️
What build specialization did u do
What’s the motion style
What’s the build at an 85
How do you throw self lob this year
Will crew cap breakers reset?
Motion style ?
What’s the build specialization
How did you get the max +2s already
This is almost the exact build i was thinking from your 6'6 video a few days ago. Am i crazy or is this the first 2k where they got posters that legit look like prime lebron?? That legend poster looks the most nasty that I've ever seen
what specialization should we choose?
1st better thanks joe knows
wheres the jumpshot joooooo
whats the takeover?
Pg build next
I built a better one in 5 minutes to help my brother who never plays but wanted a Bron lol
Moment I’ve been waiting for 😮‍💨
Thank God I’m not in the intro clips
Jumpshot? I speak spanish, Your understund
@0:39 you see how huge that meter was and then it shrunk at the last second? Oh na. I see I can’t go slasher until they go back to 2K20 days. Even the dunk before that. Meter way too small for consistency compared to shooting.
What is his specialization?
I really was waiting for it ty for ur job  bro always a pleasure
What’s the specialisation ? Finishing or shooting ?
What specialization?
I made him 6 foot 9
Thanks!
are builds actually cheaper this year?
I did Miami build
Motion style?
have you thought about making it 6’9?
Only thing I dislike is we don’t know what animation requirements are locked behind rep rewards . Some of us will get lucky and hit the requirements while others may have to re do a whole build
So do contact dunks actually work this year ?
a lebron build with low strength and low pass acc…. this is just a SF build bro
Everybody gonna make the same build that’s how the game goes down hill🫡👎🏾
What motion style do you use?
Ngl.. that first clip was tough 🔥🔥
Bron with 72 layup is crazy 😭
Thank you Mike Wang for listening ,,i played for 1hr  before work and wanted to call out!!!!!!!!!!2k is baaaaack
Does this say "Lebron James" once you complete the build?
Thank you Joe for all you do for the community
That low agility scaring me
face creator!!!!
Next up can you drop your ideal Rec build?
If you try to make this build at 6'6 you cant even get all of these attributes.... So 6'6s are nerfed and 6'8s are insane this year. 6'7s are even worse they dont even get close.
What about the build specialization
The anti goat build
BETT
Why do YT content creators always make their players black that’s a genuine question??? Like why is your my player black and your YT
Where is the overall?
I was waiting for this ! Let’s gooo
anyone used this build yet and how did you get on? thinking of making this but as a SG
Joe got the best  LeBron intros I rember he did this for 25 in stage😂
Jooooeeeyyyy u gon make a version of this on the 5s? 😛
From now on….JOE IS THE ONLY CREATOR INVITED TO 2K DAY!!!! This guy GOATED
For me imma go minimum free throw, steal, and standing dunk. Put what i get from that into 80 block, 70ish interior d, 80ish lay up. Appreciate the template
i got all this but my build a lil better
Carmelo Anthony build next!!
Seems like everybody making 6’8 or 6’6s
Tf this a terrible build
On 2k25 I didn't play enough to unlock a cap breaker , I need an as is build
Goat
Since when did 60 interior get you bronze paint patroller I guess that’s good
Wb that motion style?
LeBron ain’t that skinny dude
How did I unlock the first Max plus 2 ?
193lbs for a bron build is wild
Ok park build nothing more.
how good is this build for rec?
why my codes from the 2K streams not workin what do i do?
Let's say your in the builder, and it only let's you max steal 80 which is like silver intercepted and glove.  Will the max plus 1 and max plus 2 unlocks allow me to go to gold and hof or will those badges be ineligible for that perk??  Really confused here.   Please help Joe.
I wanna see that 3 level scorer cleaning KD build in the park
We need that annual Jordan build next !
I asked Joe on stream not to call every build a demigod this year and he straight ignored me
JOE KNOWSSSS please make a jokic buildddd
What build specialization you using?

Can you do SGA PLEASE
what motion style you use?
What’s your build specialization ?
could you make a dbook build???
Badge wise build is mid
Same game same builder same everything lmaooo
Joe, how you would change this for 5s to get the higher pass acc?
Are the max pluses from build specialisation locked to tier 1 and 2
Are the badge max +1 and +2 permanent or do you need to regrind all of them each season?
What’s the build spécialisation you going with ?
Exactly what I was waiting for🔥
Can you Do Gianni’s build next?!
THE MOMENT WE WAIT FOR EVERY YEAR BOYS!!! 👑
