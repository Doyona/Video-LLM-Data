his striking / finishing is sublime, its so very clean and elegant very uniquely, I dont think theres a player that finishes like him in europe add that with his dribbling for his size and aerial prowess makes hes like the perfect player and can still improve furthe

Who is here to verify if it's a good decision for arsenal to sign this guy😂
Song name plsss
I'll be honest, at first I was nervous about him and wanted Gyokeres... mostly bc scoring 54 goals in one season is something Arsenal could really use at this point kfkfkfk However I didn't know much about either one of them... But reading, watching and researching about them, Sesko really looks like the best option. Harder league, pretty good with both feet, good headers, great finishing and positioning, young fella. He could turn into a beast. Next few seasons is gonna be pretty interesting to watch. Also he doesn't throw himself to the ground after one minimal touch from the opponent... so that is a pretty dope upgrade on Kai. I like him but his falls are annoying as hell
Please Arsenal do not sign this guy!!! Please sign Gyokeres 🙏 💯

Welcome to Chelsea
Не слушай никого парень только в Кристал Пэлас , ты станешь настоящим бомбардиром!!Добро пожаловать в Кристал Пэлас молодой орёл!!!💯💥👍👍👍
Nice deal for Chelsea
LISTO PARA EL BARÇA PARA HACER HISTORIA EN EL CLUB POLIDEPORTIVO MÁS GRANDE DEL MUNDO Y DE LA HISTORIA, EL BARÇA!!
Nae wonder we want him bad, imagine what this boy can become at afc. Big, strong, skills, great positioning and a killer in front of goal... Sign da ting Ben
F.C. BARCELONA ❤💙💯
Arsenal deserves this man
Getting Victor G is good but this guy will give us 10years worth of dedicated finishes and he's not at his peak yet.. with the right players around him he'll thrive.. he'll give us long ball options with his clinical first touch and finishing
Welcome to FC Barcelona!!!
Arteta could be sick the moment he told him that he wunt start b4 haverts..
Bad player !!!
Welcome to Manchester United 😊😅
come to barcelona sesko
He's big, fast, skillful, and strong. He can surely be problematic in those Arsenal corner kicks. If Arsenal misses out on Isak, Sesko is even a better center forward.
Come to Fenerbahçe
Very calm and effective finisher, by head and foot.
Sembra un pó Ibra, spero venga al Milan ❤🖤
Young Dzeko
Yeni takımı muhtemelen Bayern münih😊
come to bayern
Sesko please go to Spurs❤❤
Amazing player, Barcelona should try to sign him next year
Que venga al Barça, me parece un excelente delantero, es el reemplazo perfecto para Lewandowski, no necesita el Barça gastar un millonada por Haaland.
pls come to my club FC BARCELONA
Welcome to Arsenal!
he would fit so well in flicks Barcelona
Big teams are sleeping on this lad. This is a guy who can score you 30+ a season. He is that good.
Welcome to FENERBAHÇE 💙💛
Huels Court
Amazing talent, I wish he would sign for Fc barcelone
Raga! impressionato! Non capisco che stia a fare nel Lipsia; un giocatore del genere deve ambire a vincere tutto
Yesterday He scored hattrick in National Team 🎉
I am a chelsea fan and i do believe sesko will develop well under arteta. I do enjoy watching classic target men in the game
Wow🤩
What's the name of the first song please ? Love it ❤
O sexo vem Amazin
I hope hw come to Milan
Why this man remindes me of    shevchenko
sesko vs diogo costa😢
Scores a lot of different ways , good striker trait
Welcoem to Tottenham my freind.
welcome to manchester city sesko....
Haaland signed for City from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2022 for a relatively low transfer fee of £51.2million.. Arsenal want players that can’t even meet Haaland’s benchmark and their asking price are ridiculously jack up!! no wonder City is charge 115.. something is not right  City should be punished, greedy agents should be punished too..
Manchester united
Two footed player  he will work with Saka and it will  be incredible
He is an Alien ..Scoring Goals n fanatical football LM10 + Cr7 in one #benjaminsesko
Future ibrahimovic
Wonderkid, Superstars, Balkan Next Goat, thats what i call him
He refused to play for the worst bottlers 😂😂😂😂
Better than Jackson
Welcome to manchester united
so i watched this for what... sesko fock off 😭😭😭😭
Am i the only one who would prefer Openda
If he can score chances created by Chelsea players, he could reach 50+ goals per season, Chelsea create lots of chances
Thz guy is jet Lee he plays football  like kungu fu
arsenal's next savage brilliance striker tho
Sesko will be the arsenal erling haaland
He strikes accurately and wastes less chances
What a strike he has well come to gunners family u good ur better than ur price
Welcome to The Arsenal, Sesko❤
Sesko ira a chelsea,😂😂😂 malheur a vous les gueners
Good as Palmer
Yeah I admit he's a good finishe
Welcome to Man United😊
This guy is a great talent I never knew he was so good like this apparently I was not conversant on watching bundesliga that's why I couldn't see him play I'll love this guy play for arsenal honestly I'll be glad I wouldn't bother about isak or who so ever that my team are pursuing
Jackson is better than
ea fc wonder kid rating 86 I think he is on mine or 84. Pure potential
Hey won’t get as much time on the ball as he does here in the premier league.
seems like he does most of his best work in transistion. Would he still be effective in a team like arsenal that holds a ton of possesion?
Both legs on point... head good and speed too... Fantastic player
Sesko will be a good option for Chelsea cos he’s tall and good in aerial balls likewise ground play. And he can also score from long range.
I think he will work well with Rasmus.
Overrated, bang average.
We are really missing a player like him
Not abad one But Gyokere is much more prolific
Arsenal
He's from bundesliga, as soon he step in epl he will forget all the skills and how to score goal.
Timo Werner 2.0 loading
Too slow for premier league
He's not as best according to what I'm watching
After halland comes sesko, this is crazy🔥
Arsenal sign him now.
Sesko. Good on the turn. Great on 1 v 1. Good 1-2 passing. Good competitive speed. Great positioning
I think so
He is too heavy on the ball though. He needs space to perform. In the prem there isn't any.
Another Olivier Giroud
seems like a step above Halland
We need a striker who can score nearly 20 goals a season for us. Can he do that?
Does what Havertz does all day!
Better at scoring than Jackson ten billion times!
Looks like a Giroud
reminds me of the striker era of CR7
POV: You are a chelsea fan and u are watching what we could sign
I prefer Gyokeres
I prefer Gyokeres
He can take the position for jesus n nketiah...He fits in very well that position.....Welcome to the club dude!
Welcome to Chelsea
Arsenal target is chelsea here we go player, easy to get 🤪
I think arteta will sign him
Not good at all for the premier league. He keeps the ball far from his feet just like how Mudryk is struggling with. This is bad for a tight league. He can be good for Man city. Believe me, if Haaland is at Chelsea, Nico Jackson would be better than him.
Youtube make all player good😂😂😂
New Nicklas Bendtner
Isaak was my first option tho
Everyone's gangsta in these highlights
Welcome to Chelsea
This guy makes scoring look easy  What a player 🤯
Dovbyk is better
Manu ,arsenal and chelsea need him, its up to him to....
Welcome to chelsea
He reminds me of Zlatan. What a player. I think he is the hottest name in this summer transfer market.
A very good goal scorer, sincerely speaking he is better than Haaland
Chelsea finally have their striker
The New Zlatan Ibrahimovic 🎉
Runs like a duck 😂😂
Damn he really looks like a perfect fit for arsenal, tall strong classic striker with enough technique for that quick passing play, I love havertz but he is often way too stiff on the ball for that playstyle, arteta earned my 100% trust so I’m pretty sure he could fit both of them in the starting team
Here because of Chelsea 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
Someone should plz just imagine odegaard and dis guy on the same team I mean damn with Saka working the damn ball for him
Osimhen is better
Zesco is better 😍
gunners hear me out, we get him and rodrygo and im dreaming of bringing home ucl to the emirates.
Chelsea just activated his clause!
Bring him to Emirates immediately!
Welcome to Chelsea 💙💙💙💙💙
See height can my club act faster before Chelsea pass through the back door 😢
He is as good as Haaland
He's off to Chelsea 😂😂😂
Wellcome to chelsea, not arsendal 😂
Chelsea will hijack this deal .. watch out Lol
Let the gooners have him. Chelsea want gyockeres
I like his style of play I would be happy to have him at arsenal next season ❤
Please come😊😊😊❤
Huyu jamaa ako sawa kbsa
He is Chelsea player forget him 🤣
He's good but the question is will he survive the  EPL
Where’s his van bastenesque goal?
If you are here from twitter ♥️♥️
Nketiah better imo.
I pray we should sign him 🎉😢
This guy is a Harland that can score with both feet, do tricks and skills and can also play make be it back heels and one two passes. I can see potential, just hope they can the deal done for cheap, Edu is good at all that
I can see many goals if he signs martineli right saka left, Martin od nu 10 and sesko 9 you will see
He loves the club, he is young he can still learn a lot even his speed on the ball is fantastic guys
Sesko is a good player and he will work for us
I'm not seeing anything that Havertz and Martinelli can't do. We need Vlahovic
❤❤❤ welcome to the Gunner's family ❤❤❤
Almost same like Griezman, play football with brain. Can be good partner to Odegaard. But we need experience player that perform in big   match. We need player like Marco Asensio with incredible shooting goal.
I rather do without the music
https://youtu.be/uYlnzQ6_2yw
💪
Have faith in mikel and edu
I think I like his move offensively arsenal should get him first,he has the height.
He is really underrated.
Genuine question, what happens with G.Jesus? Presuming just rotating?
The play on 1:16...the pass, the finish 🔥🔥
great vid
Please come to arsenal
Let's not get carried away,  Yaya Sanogo looked good on a YouTube compilation 😂
looks like a very solid youngster i like the versatility he possesses and how hes selfless w the ball
Good signing for Arsenal team ❤
His greatest attribute appears to be his intelligence. He knows his move before the ball arrives. Then he'll spin in behind, or take the right to touch to play it away from the defenders grasp, or he'll know when to knock it off to a team mate or slip him in. If his composure holds up in the final 3rd could be interesting. Age is a huge factor though.
He looks good. Can use both feet
With height and skill this guy will be lethal unlike Haaland 😢
Thanks to be with him
Another hoijland
Can't wait for transfer window to open. Sesko, we need you at the Emirates
Dude remind me about Edin Dzeko
He is better than Haaland. He can drop and do link up play.
❤️ seein him in Our Gunners Colours. 24/25 and beyond⚽️🙏
Has it been confirmed though? Cos i thought he was going to ac milan?
Good squad player, we won't reach new heights with this kid till he reaches 24
He ticks many boxes to be a good fit in Arsenal
With Jesus and saka he can combine good and we will enjoy the league more with more goals. Arsenal club pliz sign him( Benjamin Sesko)
From malawi ,am Chris mseka an Arsenal fan nd I would edge you to sign Benjamin  Sesko is a good goal poacher.
too similar to havertz
He's a better goal scorer than mudrik of Chelsea we almost bought for 100
The new breed of striker is tall and imposing, like Haaland
No more golden boots for Haaland💯💯😂😂💔🙌
I like a two footed striker
We've not had a proper target man since Giroud. Hopefully he'll be a good signing.
Sesko not chelsea choise..but Arsenal because in chempion ligea...
Please arteta sign him quick I love his work ethics
Height and physicality is good
I can't wait to see him wearing our Arsenal shirt next season
The EPL is different.
he is so calm in the penalty box, natural striker.
am trying to think of what will become of arsenal if you have Saka Sesko and Rashford
Dudes impressive 😮
The next Nketiah 🔥
Like a 6'5" Thierry Henry but better in the air. Frightening potential.
The fact that he’s no nonsense infront of the goal and shoots with power and precision is eye pleasing  Cuz the only player in Arsenal squad who shoot power and accuracy without the need of unnecessary touches is Leo that’s why he’s the best finisher  Nelli was good finisher but last season’s team system didn’t favor him, he was isolated in the flank most of the games and the team only plays the RW
Welcome to Chelsea!!🎉😊😊
has he signed? or is this just another video to stink up arsenal searches on youtube
Natural striker
Why such a false and delusional title? Has he said yes yet? Is it official? Did he sign? As an arsenal fan i hate such videos bcz u give false hope nd just like murdryk its going to bite us in our ass. Why are people pretending its already a done deal? Have we even agreed on a fee? Theres also talks abt signing oshimen. Are we signing two strikers then?
Don't wear 9 please. Welcome 💥
I still don't know whether he is left or right footed
The aerial threat alone brings something to our front line we don't have. Such a well rounded player and he just turned 21
The next Haaland
He's a very exciting young talent who would flourish under a team like Liverpool, Arsenal and definitely man city.
Sawi ve mai mai
H0la -TheArsenal! 💯❤️
Can’t wait to see him in the beautiful gooner red welcome sesko
He's that strong striker arsenal needs
Imagine this guy with the magic foot of magical odegard and saka
He is not our guy
Those are Harverts tactics, similar to Harvert, or my eyes are awful
Cole palmer will make him highest goal scorer in premier League in his first season.
He wont get 10 PL goals in a season
Looks like havertz
I think he'll fit in very well or will take some time to cook but the outcome will be worth it
Yes
I prefer him than Mbappe
오지마라
Brilliant play at 4:09. He sees the LW open for the through ball but drives right first to shift the defenders over before chopping back to play the through ball to the LW.
Harvertz is now preparing to warm the bench
Welcome to arsenal
Slow
Perfect for Arsenal
A touch of Henry
Looks like they are playing a slowmo football out there. Will he be able to cope with the rapid speed of EPL .
Henry little brother 😅💪
Wow this guy is two footed he is another unicorn in football but a striker this time around
Rest in peace PL clubs
Hes been on my personal radar since early 2023 I hope Arsenal move for him. The boy is talented.
I can't wait to. He signs for CHELSEA , Then hear Arsenal Fans say he isn't Good Enough for us anyway LOLOL😂😂😂..Welcome to Chelsea Sesko.
His confidence to score with both feet reminds me of Van Persie. Sesko's age also means he can only get better, and his height is that added bonus. I'm sure he will make us win some proper silverware
Surely better than Halland
They got Haaland up9front   and we are thinking Sesko.   Wake up and smell the coffee
arsenal should hurry before Chelsea replicates and start pretending, here we go
He is not excellent but not bad.
Come on Arsenal, grab it fast.
Man I can’t lie, this will get me mad if y’all pick him up…  been backing him for so long now. I wish new castle would pick him up throw isak on the wing
We all know it’s 50/50 between personality and skills when Arteta is choosing his players. I think this guy has some mentality aswell.
Welcome friend!😊
Si llega buen fichaje para el Arsenal.
Whoever might come, just don't put havertz back at CM again.
Arsenal need quick, fast paced striker. A fox in the box kind of forward. Sesko is good but a bit slow. He has Havertz kind of play.
He reminds me of Marouane Chamakh. It's s no from me.
Cracking player and calm facing goal. Couldn't see him fit in arsenal with our 1 striker up front. But he can certainly turn it on from a deep position with such pace. He's a sreal at £45million, big steal. But i never take any arsenal target news seriously in May june most if July. Myself & sons look forward to it though and laugh at some "targets" and the fans excitement and "welcome to arsenal" comments at 90% of these so called targets 😂
We would have won the league if we had him as our 9 this past season
In a years time everyone will know your name.
He has a lot going on. I hope his mondset is "not fugging around". If aggressive and confident he can do well. We need one guy obssessed with goals. The fact that he can do many things is great but i hope it's not only complimentary to a killer mindset. Very nice if we can have him.
Is this confirmed??
I'm not impressed with what he has done in Leipzig, where Openda did the show. But he is doing great with the national team. Let's watch him with Slovenia during the Euros 24.
He isnt much different to Havertz. We need another type of striker
Reminds me of Torres
He is just as good as Gabriel martinel, only that he can use both legs effectively....it will be a good signing for us
Very impressed with what I've seen. He can even play on the left wing
Best welcome to Arsenal
He is like Giroud, but a better finisher! If the price is true, the lad sound a good deal!
Dominance in the box
Sesko is lewandoski type of striker.
He  likes Giroud. Good Target Man striker but We need a finisher. It's different. We need someone likes L. Suarez. In these time i choose Viktor Gyökeres or Osimhen.
place him next to kai now please
He reminds me alot of Isak
I like what I see
impressive ball control for someone his size...it's about time we got a bully upfront and add more threat to our already outstanding setpiece play
Score feet head,plus got speed skill,
He like ledowski around box
He is a scorer, both feets, and he scores with his head also, and its not easy for him to loose ball
Critical CF arsenal must buy him
Truth be told he got some skills than Halland where by he can fight for the ball with thee opponents if that's the situation from the corner point to scoring as one man army which is rear
Has he actually signed
his legs not strong & fast enough.
Assume you having Saka,Sisko,Havetz,Odegard,Rice,Trossard,Martinel plus our master Arteta🔥🎉🎉🎉❤Arsenal💯
rashford,sesko/oshimen lets go
Reminds me of Gabriel Jesus, but likes shooting
Im not sure, we need more of a flare player
He's a brilliant and young player and he's only going to improve under Arteta at Arsenal
Yaya Sa "no" goal was a beast in these youtube videos😂
Looks good, ah lil stiff but I guess that’s just the size of him
He reminds me a bit of Berbatov
He looks sick. But will he be a 20-goal-a-season striker?
He looks comfortable in front of Goal, not flashy but gets the job done.
Please come to Arsenal
Looks very similar to Havertz but a bit more natural at finishing his chances. Think he’ll do well for Arsenal.
Rapid! 😮
Haha al Pacino in the background is class
Gyokeres come to m.u
Imagine odegared cooking assist😮
For a 6'5" player this guy looks so good with ball. Under the right manager he has got a lot of upside for improvement. He is going to fit perfectly for Arsenal
After much time watching him he is a good striker..both feet's excellent
best young striker in world football right now, will outscore Haaland
Nico Jover salivating with next season set piece tactics
I think Arsenal would be perfect for him. Only 21 so his best years still have to come but already looking very promising
He look a real deal or with the right guide can be a gem
Is he a done deal  yet
This guys got 200 potential, 4* weak foot and 4* skills   He’ll definitely be the best player in the universe because I just said so    This is how it works round here, right?
2 and half minutes into this video, and I've seen enough.  Arteta, get the deal done.
His link up play remind me a bit of king giroud
Sell Jesus and bring in sesko, we might even make a profit while improving
I dont think arsenal can get him. Any player with high demand I find it hard to believe arsenal can pull it of.
Would much rather a signing of this Ilk, someone arsenal can develop into a real force with the group of players we already have, class get it done. Can see a bit of giroud in his play. His size looks made for the prem
Hes so good shooting with both feet.  If he put on another 20 or 30 pounds of muscle he'd be a monster. This has me more excited than any other player we've been linked with.
He is fast tall and comfortably finishes with both feet.
He got good foot
RIP Benjamin Seskos Career xx
Doesn’t give assists.  Red flag
Didier jackson --> sesko
Similar style with kai. But better finisher
Good but same profile as Havertz..we need Isak
Seems like van Persie
Welcome Benjamin Sesko to London, is Blue. lol
❤❤
Arsenal have "Mika Biereth" on loan
Edu get me this boy please❤️🤍
Strong type of player........ Not easy to be falling on the ground
Come on
He is good with his head and he can score with both legs. The price tag is also what Arsenal loves please get this done
He should come and compete with Halland. This guy will score goals
Made for PL 🔥
For 45 Mil I will say it's a good bargain
Not going to be upset if we sign him. The link ups with Saka and Ødegaard will be a nightmare for our opponents.
we are not signing any striker this season, be happy with havertz and nketiah
I remember the ManU fans extensively talking about Rangnick wanting to bring him at OT 3 years ago.  I think he was at Salzburg at the time.
He isn't going to room like this in the Premier League but he looks a clean striker of the ball, good skill and a big unit. Hope we get him.
👍
He's a Kai Havertz with pace, ball striking and can score headers
New Hanry
Like …if he adapts well…he’s going to cause real trouble upfront for opposing teams
He is like Halland
This guy will convert all of Odegaards passes
A complete striker uses both feet & also good in the air.❤❤
He shoot like truck
Pace Pace Pace   Ball control   Dribble master   Pay the damn money Edu!!
Seems like a decent player who is willing to work. Most of his examples see him collecting the ball deep and the. Making something out of nothing which is great. However the see examples also Show teams with terrible defending. I want to see the one where he’s taking on low blocks.
I like his name Sesko, very hurt
Не понимаю он правша или левша?)
I really like this guy bring him to the team seriously
Good Player for Excelent price😑😑😑😑
Proper striker 👌
welcome to Manchester United
Pls Arteta no more mistakes if he ain’t good enough to start for his club then we shouldn’t be buying him !!! We can’t be competing in the EPL and Champions league with a second choice striker ,take a look at City ? In my estimation ISAK or GYOKERES !!! Period !!
If he’s that good why then is loic Openda the preferred choice !!!
welcome to Arsenal
He executed numerous direct passes into the penalty box from crosses or straight from midfield to the goal, enhancing Arsenal's attacking force and completing the puzzle.
Best skill, Future Arsenal
デカくてヘッド決めれるのガブちゃんしかいなかったから、欲しかったタイプ
As MCI fan better than haaland…
sesko + Havertz = *french kiss* 🤌
Playing style like giroud❤
I'll be here when United sign him and Arsenal fans now say he's overrated
we dont need him we got havertz..we need AML,CM and LB..
realy here we go ?
0:56 I’m mad skeptical of this guy but cl that first touch was 🥶
Welcome to Arsenal 🎉
Hato, Zubimendi and Sesko. Getit done
Future striker indeed for arsenal, technique, dribble, passing and shooting
Gettin fed by martinelli and Saka he will be a plus for Arsenal COYG🤞
This guy is extra ordinary
Let’s go🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Chelsea want him too
Looks good off the ball, which is a quality Arteta likes. I think he'll be compatible with Arsenal.
Many of us fans say "We were hoping to get Gyökeres" But We trust and support Arteta's and Edu's decision. They know what's the best for Arsenal. If it is not too early to say; Welcome to the family Benjamin❤
If Arteta want him then I want him so bad. Sesko reminding me of RVP vibes.  Link up play dope, pace dope, height dope, both left and right footed well check, heading is perfect and his dribbling is satisfying. All I could see here is a goal machine  He could be the next big striker to grace football and first proper striker Mikel Arteta has been looking for in over 4 years in his manager career🤲.
Dia pemain nomor 9 yang bisa menahan bola lebih lama stylish sangat cocok dengan skema arteta
Benjamin Sesko is a good striker, welcome to Arsenal
Just good striker overprice with €42M
Hi Pep 👋 I know you've just watched this video 😊
He is good on both feet.... really physically fit, his height is also a good advantage, can pass front and backheel pass....comparing to kai...he is more physical and faster....he is a good fit for arsenal
He's slow as hell. Reminds me of Lord Bendtner. Also be real what has he got that Havertz hasn't got upfront. Isn't there anyone more prolific?
Bro is doing all this before he even turns 21. Madness. Get him in to the Arsenal NOW
We dont need him
He’s Haaland with 2 feet and better dribbling
Only want ishak
He needs to go back to deep space nine
It's fated that Benjamin Sisko will become our new DS9. It's been written in the Star Trek universe.
okay goal keepers and defending in bundesliga appear to be very poor
No way, this guy is too slow for EPL. He won’t get so much time on the ball in PL.and will get easily marked by big full backs in PL. PL is different than Bundesliga . He Doesn’t bring anything special than what we have in Havertz. We need someone who is quick with the ball and  can help breaking the low block like Jesus but better in finishing.
He’s good, but he isn’t what we need to take us to the next level. We can’t afford another Youngster who sits on the bench and wastes away
Odegard will make him look prime Henry,infact he has Henry's pace and calmness on finishing
I love him already ❤
He got super speed..
At least we have someone who can convert ødegaards passes to goals.. ❤
We are missing a footballer who scores goals with a header
He's like Havertz but quicker and stronger
We want Zirkzee
Not good enough for the title. He's just a little bit better than Havertz.
I can see lewandowski in his face
This guy ssucks technically.. Isak is sooooooooooo much better
I like Benjamin Šeško A LOT. To me he is a more complete striker than Haaland. Unlike Haaland who is super leftfooted, Benjamin Šeško is ambipedal. Also unlike Haaland, Šeško actually scores a lot with his head. He has better body and ball control, more skillful than Haaland. There's very little backlift to let off powerful shots with either foot.  As far as the Alexander Isak comparisons goes. Isak wasn't highly rated the season before joining Newcastle . In the 2021-2022 season, Isak scored only 10 goals (in all competitions) for Real Sociedad, who finished 6th in La Liga. Newcastle bought Isak for 70 Mil, now he is worth over 100 Mill.  Benjamin Šeško is the perfect mix of Haaland & Isak (with a better injury history). So 50-60 Mill, for a 20 year old, 6ft5, fast, skillful, two footed, intelligent player, coming from a team that finished 4th in the Bundesliga.   If we get him, we get a great deal and set on the striker position. And after he becomes one of the best strikers in the world, winning us the EPL and Champions League, in 5 - 6 years from now, we can sell him for 200 Mill at 26-27 years old 🤞🏾😂🤣
Bienvenido al ARSENAL,  gran jugador
6”5’ , 20yrs old , Technical, Fast, 2 footed, Power strike. €45m is beyond a steal. Welcome to the Arsenal , he’s going to become something unreal in that setting 📈
Already have Havertz seems like a similar player?
Legs like Bambi to ganki injury list like jesus
Get him,he has the potential to thrive in the premier league
Sesko and chido Obi will be a good strike partner with their height
the new Scamacca?
Gyökeres is my preferred player but after having watched Sesko, he might be the player we longed for.
Both feets is crazy... get him immediately
Love the fact that he's a little raw but you can already see he has a lot going for him that Arteta could definitely refine. His positional play is already impressive at such a young age.
He is like a skilled version of haaland. Just not the same luck as haaland and not the same service from midfield, to be honest our midfield can cook with rice and ødergard. So hopefully if we get him he will be up there in the golden boot run
2 words. Viktor Gyokeres. Remember the name
Chelsea gonna highjack y’all I can see it😂
wish we got isak or gyokeres instead honestly but hopefully he surprises me
He is a complete striker
Chelsea will steal him as they always do
Reminds me of RVP a little. Very good at finishing. Sounds like a perfect fit for Arsenal
Well i prefer Sporting Lisbon Striker
We still need another more established striker even if we sign Sesko....we just need that fire power...we need depth an good options
he's like a hybrid of Kai Havertz and Isak. This guy is a better finisher than Kai, and so mobile for someone of his size. If he can get accustomed to the PL, he could easily become top 3 strikers in the world. There's more about his play than Haaland.
ow you got sesko? that s a good buy, technical player
I trust Arteta
How is Arsenal going to play him and Havertz?
A transfer to Arsenal would make sense
I see a lot of similarities between him and Auba before Arsenal and at Arsenal. The flair, speed, curls and curves, body shape before shots and curves... are reminders of Auba glory days.   He should be a success at Arsenal.
Weak foot 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Let get the deal done Gunners 😮😊
Looks a good prospect.  He's got the one thing we don't already have at Arsenal and Haaland has for City.. A shot which the keeper doesn't see 'til it's past him.  Someone who hits the ball that hard and accurate will score loads in this Arsenal team IMO.
Saliba white Gabriel sesko havertz who the fucks going to defend corners against us 😂
This is the kind of striker arsenal need not signing rubbish
Isak is clear
Definitely half price Isak
If arsenal want to win the PL we have to get issak this guy is a level up but we are going against a guy called haaland and city which will strengthen more we didn’t win the league because we just didn’t have the goals in the games we didn’t win like villa away big summer #coyg ⚪️❤️
nah man he too skinny and lanky for the prem, he's gonna get bullied. they ought to opt for a physically dominant and target man type of player like halland or lukaku
Every Football youtuber has just watched this, finished a game of FIFA and are now total experts on him.
He is epic at 1v1
Nothing special about him except for pace and of aerial threat,won't survive in the EPL .
Imagine trying to defend a corner against giants like Gabriel, saliba, havertz and sesko while Ben White is undoing the goalie's gloves 🔥
He is basically giroud with a better weak foot
🔴⚪
Welcome to Emirates and goodluck ❤🎉🎉
I’m not mad at this. He got a bit of everything about him. Young too
Remind me a little bit of young Zlatan Ibrahimovic
Reminiscent of Christian Vieri…
He is fire. Known his class since he was 17
Naah, not good enough
Sesko is a real goal machine, this guy will help arsenal win the league and the champions league
If arsenal get sesko that means arsenal will be loosing nketia,mika biereth, and probably Jesus because they can't keep 3_4 striker. As for me i would have let's arsenal promote Mika biereth and let's him compete with havertz then buy midfielder
Becoming a Chelsea payer soon
odegaard 25+ assists
His backheel is quite accurate. He looks like a perfect fit for Arsenal. Welcome to Arsenal.
His birthday tomorrow (21) lol
Not gonna believe until he wears the jersey.
like Crouch but slightly better ball carrier.
He wouldn’t score half of those in the premier league. But at 21 and being 2-footed, I’m quite excited about the prospect of Arsenal signing him. Massive potential here.
This guy is damn good. Very technical, very pacy, very physical without playing dirty (no rough play or stupid shoulder barges, etc). Hope we get him!
Taller version of shevchenko
Weak foot is nice
lets goooo
I look forward to next season. Let’s go invincible
Seems better than Nketiah
Two footed player🔥🔥
I wish him to Arsenal
Цена и качество ! 45 млн фунт и ценник не будет давить для молодого напа
This will be our Nketiah replacement to start...effectively replacing someone close to his ceiling, with someone a long way from his. In a severely over-inflated striker market. This is damn good business from Arsenal if the reports are true.
Can strike clean with both feet, tall can finish and he's young. His  positioning is good for a 20 year old. I reckon we take him and we don't need to break the bank for him
I watch his game against man u around 2019 when he was in salburgs, he is a pure talent.
Apakah sudah resmi ke arsenal
I don't want this guy is not a natural striker 9
Something I noticed in the video is that he has clean strike on both feet.. and very good with his head. Physical and skillful. Welcome sesko
weird not wowed by him like i was with pepe, seems like a great player but i think we can do better. but hey i thought pepe was a good signing so i just #trustinarteta
I want him♥️
As a striker first thing you need is positioning and he got that❤
If this guys delivers like these highlights are showing...arsenal is getting a beast and he's joining a club that suits he's style...again, its a big if because these are just highlights, havent really followed the G
I just love havertz playing as CF man
Better finisher than martinelli
Welcome to
He runs like haaland
He runs like haaland
For 45 million it’s a no brainer. Arteta will turn him into 120 million player
Another Havertz... Arteta will never learn
We need someone like him to support the squad.  You are warmly Welcome to Asernal.
A complete striker he is young just 20 he has height physicality and can head can finish we don’t need a dribbler we need a goal poacher which he is and he will develop into that arsenal team perfectly with odegaard behind him
Is it done ?? Here we go or ornstein bomba
I am not impressed, this is not the kind of striker we need at the moment
Haverts and sesko can give arsenal 50 goal contribution
welcome to arsenal
Welcome to England, brace up for intensity and hardcore plays... Prove yourself here
Natural goal scorer. The best goal scorers make scoring look easy and that's exactly what Sesko is about. get him to Arsenal  already
I'll preface my comment with the fact that I'm just a casual fan so don't kill me. I think he too much like Havertz.
Still raw but trust in mikel
Get Sesko & Gyokeres for Arsenal@The Gunners❤🙏👍
Just turning 21. He's got all the attributes to reach the very top. No better club than Arsenal to help him achieve that
A more athletic and skillful version of Giroud. Get him at all costs gunners.
Hmmm looks like Havertz 2.0!!  We need someone more deadly in front of goal COYG
Welcome
Overated. European football is really declining in quality.
RVP x Giroud hybrid
He's movement and style looks  like Alexander Isak
No different from Havertz
Now we all no he’s agreed terms with arsenal
He’s only 20 that’s mental
Sesk you're welcome
This is the white version of Thierry Henry
this is first time i hate so much with player and his name is baby striker sesko, arsenal really need killer striker in his prime for make sure win UCL AND EPL NEXT SEASON
I think he's not bad at all.. he's an upgrade to Jesus
Hes acc soo fast wow
He has potential, might be the best option for now.
Welcome yes
Believe in Arteta
If we get this done, I’ll be happy but tbh I would’ve preferred Gyokeres. The guy showed he was capable of playing in the Championship and then to go up a level at Primeira Liga.
He could work at Arsenal
Welcome benjamin sesko 🔥
