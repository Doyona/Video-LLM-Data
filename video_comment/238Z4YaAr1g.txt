You can tell by once is not country.,   first of all no country will not say B word in their lyrics. Second most if not all tells a story, she just taking gibberish as long it rhymes. Where’s the cowboy hat and country people wear clothes, they not ghetto. Yes there is poor white trash but at least they wear clothes. Nice try Byonce You are no match with Taylor Swift.
That song was horrible Lil nas with dirt road  was 100% better and that sucked. Leave our country music alone. Country music isn't a trend its a lifestyle

Best true female country artist is Lauren Alaina!! Hands down!!
This Jacket 🎉🎉🎉 Very good Song
Beyoncé isn’t just performing — she’s setting standards. Every era, every show, every move feels like a statement of power and creativity. That’s real artistry.
musica linda de mais 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you ❤ I could be anything to be with you ❤
🖤🎵🎶📻🎧
Beyonce got these bounced🔥🍆
3:20 hi
At her age ..AMD those who has not sagging ..that's either surgery or grace..great singer great song 😊
Old and current music

50 Cent’s country parody song is much better.
She's mean to me but I do like it❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊

Clearly doesn't know how a gun works
Personally I think its crap stick to what you know 😂
You all know that they control the industries,right? Even the song and MV are suck,they still win the award. The Grammy are now ruined by them IYKYK 🤣💩
Not gonna lie; in my opinion this is the music that actually fits her voice like amazingly. I’m not usually a fan of country music but I definitely am feeling this.
Are we expected to sit and watch this till the end? 😂  She's got old and lazy now?
That banjo man, dayyyyyum.
🤢🤢🤢🤢
This ai music is weird.
Daddy lessons' being my favourite song is finally paying off😂
Stupid

RAINHA 👑👸
Perfect song for my playlist.
Ya know... For the last year, I've been wondering why do black people have this sudden infatuation with Texas!? Outta nowhere!? Cowboy hats in the hood... Texas,Texas,Texas!? All because of this stupid little boring song!? 🤷🏻‍♂️⁉️ I mean, to ea his/her own...  I guess
I remember when this song came out last year, and I saw countless Videos of people and family having fun!🙂
I'm just now seeing this video for the first time. It is, I think, October 4th 2025. And I just want to tell you, it is not pretty. I knew that there was some controversy about some type of music that she was playing. That was country. I don't know the whole story. But if this is it the video they were talking about, then I can see why whoever side would have a problem with it. Because I have a problem with it. It is very distasteful if that's even a word. But yeah, I'm not impressed. I would have been better off just hearing the words and never seeing the video.😮
Sounds like Taylor Swift
Love her🎉
Fuuccckkkk ..... ain't coming here to listen to her song ... Just wondering how u people support this illuminati lady who killed a lot of innocent artist......this fucking evil girl sucks.......thuiiiiiii.......
I never thought that she could a Song Like this

Really ? Why hardly any clothes on......good role model ay
This is not country
Hoffentlich stirbt so etwas durch die scheiss genderei nicht aus!!!!!!¡!!!
The song is great.  This video is disappointing.
I don't understand how they don't realize if it wasn't for white people they would still be in mud huts
Screaming racism while being racist screaming culture appropriation while stealing other people's culture. This is just totally ⬛ ppl behavior
The production is top-notch.
You don't know what this NY stuff is were  native American ....and she pisses me off just as much as the next one
THIS AIN'T BINGO. NUNYA BUSINESS WHERE MRS. CATER IS!
This song & video is the equivalent of Raygun Breakdance at the Olympics .
Why are black people taking our music?
I heard this song on WhatsApp recommendations and I really loved it. Excellent lyrics and a very beautiful voice from the singer. Greetings from Mexico.🇲🇽❤
I pray just like it, Fault Tolerant Quantum Computer 2029, Stargate flight doing better than money restore experience time in advancements nature in technology doing better than death everything in life Aliens among us Boyz II Men On Bended Knee and God bless America the future and life extension of the universe. Amen. God bless.
What is next?Maybe Jay Z craping with a Country beat and then they will give him album of the year or call him the next great thing in country music
Beyoncé leave country you are horrible for real don’t come to this side trying to ruin country music who the fuck even let this devil worshipper even come to country
I just watched the same s2pid thing on repeat. Well, 3 times. It’s as dumb a music video as I’ve ever seen. I thought she had money.
Musica muito boa, mais bem que podia ter batido um brisa de vento ai, seria bem interessante 😏
It repeating the same thing
Beyonce can sing the cook book and rock it !!
🤢🤮
Youll never be white, just a crude mockery of something so clearly superior. Like a temu version.

It’s still expensive even for a drugstore brand.
Splurged on L’Oréal revitalift earlier - it’s working really well for me.
Well I guess my stripping days are over but I need to carve a new path for this chapter of my life.
Yeah it was night tony the stalker never met me despite what he claims. He should be banned from that establishment he probably pisses everyone off. Good thing I’m not working there because he would be banned.
wtf is she wearing
No hate beautiful song but whats up with the video?
this is trash
Beyonce is very special and talented.
But i wanna holdem like they do in texas🥺
Mane y'all slow ASF it didn't say this was a music vedio go back to school kids lol
Lazy shit
Image buying grammys cuz you can't win em and you have to steal one from someone. What music even is this?
Well, Beyoncé song just didn’t get as many hits as it should’ve had
We love you Beyoncé Cowboy Carter ❤

Though not the same, heavily influenced by Kenny Rogers The Gambler. However this song much earlier in the melody  get to it’s signum sound. The Gamblar takes a bit more time, melody wise.

I love this song, but this is a really boring video.
🙌🙏🙏🙌🤙🏿🤙🏿
Is there any kind of song Beyonce can't do? I'm hoping to hear pop from before 1900, and opera. It will be great. I am saying this from the rural West,, with experience in road houses and dive bars
Crap music

I wish you a long life, so you can see your children experience what you did onto others.

TRASH ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Cultural Appropriation
RATCHET GHETTO.
What a joke!😂 Mumble like the fat Albert gangs' Mushmouth. How about putting music to the words " don't touch me! I can't breathe, I didn't do nufin'😂." Bmamba. Mbutu 😂. Do a land apology. To the cowboys.
As much as I hate to admit Beyonce is a pretty good at country music.
Mi ai fatto cieca😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CRAP SONG
Oooooo hooooo
Ахуенный клип 🤦
Beyonce is trash just like her husband and music maybe even more so. Proud native here.
great song.... congratulations from the society of deaf people of Texas
It's not too bad

Using this as my TikTok video and then I took and then my TikTok account got banned so I remember this song it gives me memories😢😢
This is so fucking terrible 🤣🤣
What's everyone bitching about?? Beyonce does a pretty good job..better than a lot of these fake ass country singers coming out of Trashville today!!..
Couldn't she sing without showing her boobs ??
❤❤❤
70 m views for visualizer?? Imagine she released the real music video 😢
Hey Shaun, I know you’re checking these comments every 30 minutes :) Does unemployment come with unlimited comment replies?
Beautiful song but horrible video pure vanity 3 minute of just porn shame on you beance
Beyonce and Officer Andrea Gurecki,,,drilled it into me,,,about the beauty queen I was to be with,,,thats you @kimmy Granger
Horrible song by a black Taylor Swift ripoff
she's beautiful and give alot of inspiration❤
Stop using twang. Stop appropriating my culture.
Regardless of the beat, that has got to be one of the dumbest videos ever... No skill required to flash titties and look like a street walker.
Vistir roupa REPresenta amiga A❤❤
Nothing natural about her except perhaps the voice😅
Billie is the best
I like this song
🎶 🎵 Hey it's Fraaaaankkin, Comin' over to my house. 🎶 🎵  It sounds like the theme song to me. Sped up a bit with a bit of a different tempo 😅😂😂
This reminds me the adventures of piggley winks 😂😂😂❤

Is this really the video? 10sec looped? Get the fuck outta here
She is the most garbage artist there is.  Sometimes she talks like shes from the ghetto sometimes she dont now she tries to sound southern. And wtf does this line even mean, this is Texas, [AINT NO HOLDEM]?! Dat shit IS ASS. This the most ass shit i ever witnessed.   I could t even make it 30sec without stopping to talk shit
Hollo tia🔫💘
what is wrong with you?
Good grief. This is bad. She is Queen of pop/rock but damn… should have stuck with what she does best. I can’t believe THIS won an award. In country. Sounds like a DEI award. And to anyone saying this makes them like country…. Sorry. You, this has nothing to do with country. You still like Beonce. But you ain’t listening to country on this one.
I love it best song from her ever. ❤
She is turning white like Michael Jackson.
1:00 one step to the right!!
desperation makes people do some crazy shit lmfao what a fucking awful decline..... she needs to just find a new job if she aint a thing anymore cause country aint fuckin it for her at all
Anyone here August 13 2025
It’s OK, but she’s trying too hard to be cool - just do some country straight up
Beyoncé basically sent me to the navy with this
Happy Monday Bonnie
Love the song … can do without seeing her implants 😂😂😂
I was raised on country. This song is many things but it ain't country. I feel like it's only popular cuz like always she's running around almost naked
This is not country
What the actual f
I love Beyoncé ✨
Negra y se cree blanca. Michael jackson?
Nooo she’s not country.  Just because you put Texas in your song doesn’t make you country.  It’s not lost on me she’s from Texas.
Song’s ok, video sucks.
Not even remotely country 🤦 this is pop music
So, if I replace the 64's in my raps song for a horse and slip a guitar in with twang in it, I could be country, too?😅🤣😂 She's country like Tracy Adkins is. This has nothing to do with her race either. Black people are the OG cowboys if you don't know. It's just super hard to believe that SHE is in any way country. The big city life Diva over sang in all her old Hip Hop and R&B cuts and now she is over singing in country, too. Whatever. But, how much support would Alan Jackson get if his next album was Gansta Rap? You tell me. M.C. Hammer tried to switch from Gospel Rap to Gansta Rap and he got slaughtered for it. (M.C. Hammer is more gangsta than 99.9% of "Gangsta Rappers". For real.)That's in the same genre! Art Official Age as the late, great, greatest of all time, Price put it. (If you don't know, look it up.) There is a reason why Darius Rucker was able to cross over to country; he only had to slightly jump over a narrow gap. Beyonce has an ocean to cross to connect her old to new. But, that's only if you care about authenticity. If not, Beyonce is also the heaviest metal vocalist there has ever been. 🤘Hooray, Beyince!!!! You go , girl!!!

Loved the tour Texas live version ❤🎉 so sad the tour is over & cowboy country is over😢
And why are you naked??
Good song but your still not country
Not country at all.  I don’t respect her like I did.
I love Beyonce, but she never should have won that award for best country music award. There were better country songs with better lyrics. She won it because of who she is, not because of the song. Park your Lexus?  The dive bar we always thought was nice? If anything it was a parody of what country music songs are about. The end that was like R&B...complete BS that she won.
She stold this from the Mexican singer. Guess who she is??
Love you Beyonce ❤❤❤ Blue

J’ai du mal à comprendre pourquoi Beyoncé a besoin jouer à ce point sur son sex- appeal  alors que son talent suffit à la propulser sur Mars.Un  mystère pour moi …
To me this song is a 6.5 Ottua 10
This is not country…
She got a shirt on
RUBBISH
Hello alleluia every body come on lets party now. its your girl Beyonce and i love you all smuah.
This song does not need strong sexy outfit of Beyonce. The song is good enough without it and would benefit without the outfit.
Just show a woman with the least amount of clothes on and you can make a clip that exists out of a small fragment on a loop. Good song though but come on, a bit more effort in the clip would've been nice
Tommy Johansson does a funnier upbeat version  Go check him out
Beyonce's cowboy carter is the shortest tour to make 400 million of any genre.
Beyonce's cowboy carter tour is the highest grossing country tour of all time. Billboard.
A tour se foi. Essa era foi incrível! 👑🐝
Hey Beyonce, word got out that a $1 million dollar bounty to take my life was contracted from the deep web to kill me.  You have done rituals against me and wicked evil when I didn’t even know you.  This isn’t the first from you but word is out of what you have been trying to kill me and this is going back even before I knew you but you had a lot to say about me.  You’ve been exposed for the bounty on me.
Lmao what the fuck is this hahahahha
Country+rap=crap
Пора уже и трусы снимать. Чего уж там мелочиться😂😂😂
Why is she naked? Why are so many female musicians dressing worse than your average hooker? It's insane 🤦‍♂️

I know that it is a very striking image, but seeing the same thing over and over again was annoying.  Edit: So people are saying it's not a music video but instead "a visualizer." Still annoying.
❤
I love the song but the half naked shit is uncalled for.
TEXAS izzzz the SHIT!  IDC where you've been, as AMERICANS, we ALL LOVE US SOME TEXAS BABY, HELLLLL YEAH....  Little Beyonce just up there doin her thang MANNNN....get it girl!

Had to stop at the “Park your Lexus” lyric, lol. Least country/Texan thing I’ve heard in a long, long time, haha.
She reveals a bit too much to be as classy as other very very successful stars. Over rated
The hell is this. This ain’t country
3:57 the best part of the song
Ganz übel was aus ihr geworden ist!!!
No just no
My ass sings better country music after taco bell
Trash music.   Fake “cowgirl”   Fake all around.  And Jay looks like everyone’s lez aunty
Classic song. No need for vulgar language. I'm from Ireland
I get why ppl mad at her, no substance
Good cover love it xx😂
<<  !!! >>
They could have made a whole story music video with this song. Maybe a cowgirl on the run from authorities. Going to a pub, the sheriff comes and suddenly everyone is dancing to distract him and his men.. as they dance, they block his way and Beyonce escapes once again but not before she gulps down a glass of whiskey. Yep, would have been a nice video
Love all about wistom in the world
I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. There is nothing about her that she can call "country". She has embarrassed herself with this one. Country fans are outraged. Uuuhhhh, no Beyonce.
too fat
Love  so much 😢😂❤

🇵🇱🔥🎆🎇 #BlackjackBlood,  #gamblersdelight, #Blackjack
Thanks for the songs Beyonce thank you. Asa
Put a shirt on, Mom. No one wants to see that
Anyone here in July 2025?!
Is there an award for worst music video of all time?
Trash. Not country at all .

Trop bonne dans cette tenue
I can’t understand how these ladies could dress up like street walkers and be proud. It’s disgusting.
Oy vey
🐝 ❤️⭐️
I didn’t know everything that’s why it’s upsetting

😬⭐️🐝
This is more country than anything country bros have done in twenty years
❤
I love you  Beyoncé ❤❤❤

I'm sorry, but we don't undress like that in real country music vids. Why don't you stick with what you're really good at, because this is not your calling.
À ma chère et tendre mère,ma fantastique soeur et ma super fille. Je vous aime pour toujours.
Whenever you’re this successful…speak freely
Los cuatro minutos admiré lo que se puede admirar 🙈🙉🙊
It's so cool ❤❤❤
Oh yes Black Americans did in fact invent Traditional and Contemporary Western and Country Music. The very first singing and yodeling Cowboys were in fact Black Americans. Black Americans taught our White American Brothers and Sisters how to play, sing and yoldel Traditional and Contemporary Western and Country Music.
Ain’t country , stupid black woman needa stop tryna to step in some shoes she know SHE CAN NEVER FILL !!
Isn’t this someone else’s music ????
i like her country outfit...but Gavin is right..this ain"t country just because it had some country words..
Not country
I cannot stop singing this!!  ❤
This amazing female artist is scoring out of this world HOT HOT HOT she's the most working hardest and has the most inspiring soul to make others know there own worth ❤❤❤❤

NWO ONE EYE LUCIFER WORSHIPPER
STOP YOUR NWO LUCIFER SUBVERSION OF COUNTRY FOLK STOP APPROPRIATING CERTAIN WHITE CULTURE
I bought 3 pairs of cowboy Carter boots,  I am saving for a 4th pair in brown!😂😅
cultural appropriation.
Why is she comming out like that?  She doesn't  have to shes beautiful  n can sing!
definitely not country music...
Sux
You want a laugh? Several times Beyoncé has failed to sellout her shows in Scotland that they were giving tickets away for free in the car park (people didn’t want tickets), same with jay z several times😂
Die Figur der Tante = echt zum hingucken. Aber für die Ohren schalte ich ab.
Some budget on the corney video, and it ain't country music.
A black woman want to be white, see?
I listened to my first song off this album after hearing Gavin Adcock's remarks about it.    How he can say it doesn't 'sound country' is idiotic.
Doesn’t even sound like county 😂 why she trying to go there with it 💀 doesn’t sound good cause it sounds like jays music no one bumping it 😂
What is this 😂😂😂
Is this supposed to be country music?
TARGETEDJUSTICE IS AN LLC OUT OF TEXAS WHISTLE BLOWING ON 5G NEUROLINGUISTIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT , DARPAS BRAIN INITIATIVE TO CONTROL THE HUMAN MIND ,,,, STOP 5G MIND CONTROL,,, WE ALLL KNOW ,,,,LETS NOT PRETEND WE DONT'
Never been a beyoncé listener before, but this song got me
All i can think about while listening to this song are those motorcycles being ran over by a truck.
I like this song but it would have been much better if a real country singer sang this. I really hope a real country.Singer remixes this because it would be a much better version.
❤❤❤ How can you not love 💕 her.😊. Beautiful spirit.
“Don’t be a b*tch come take it to the floor now” 🔥🔥🔥
Why does she have to be naked? Is she a strip teaser or a musician? Shame on the human race. Shame on the men who tell the women to publicly undress and Shame on the women who do it. And this one definitely doesn't need the money. What is she at? No dignity, integrity, or sovereignty.
I love you Beyoncé ❤❤❤❤😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉
Why has she got to have tits out all time. Absolutely discusting.
Worst Music Video goes to...
1. Whitney Houston  2. Mariah Carey  3. Rihanna  17. Beyoncé  I didn't think the music couldn't get any worse from her last albums until I saw the music videos. 🗑 💩 🤢
Like she ever went to a Cowboy dive bar. Worst video I've ever seen. The only "good" thing is the banjo.
Vous êtes sexy Beyoncé
This is the artist favorite of My artist favorite Kenia os
She's making fun of Texans... and most are too stupid to see it!!
shit video, musics ok.
"NICE VISUAL THO!!!!😂🎉❤
"REALLY LISTEN BOYSS? ....😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢NOTHING NICE.
"Official Visualizer????"   Nothing Country about this except for the finger gun.  What was the choreographer and costume designer thinking???   What is this?? Steam Punk Dominatrix???  Singing a country song that just screams for a good line dance....this was not well thought out.
Das nennt man Evolution 😊😊😊
Trash
On peut se demander pourquoi avoir besoin de se montrer dénudée pour vendre de la musique ...
Thank goodness Beyoncé wasn't given Rihanna's masterpieces: Umbrella and Diamonds. I thought Beyoncé couldn't get any worse than her last album before Cowboy Carter. There's a reason it took her 25 years to finally win album of the year.
Once she dead people wil Learn about how many humans this women sacrificed during her life. What a hellish human she is. Unreal.
Clicked on this to dislike it
It's bad enough that she's half naked and wearing a hideous get-up, but it's not even her torso! Her breasts are either air-brushed or AI generated. Maybe some folks need artificial help to improve their unappealing body.. but.. Beyoncé? Really..?  Also, what is the point of this banal video? I don't think I've ever seen a more unimaginative music video. What "genius" came up with this?
Why does she keep doing the same movements 😂 1:56
A mí también me hace pensar mí Michi 😂😂😂❤
THIS IS BULLSHIT
Can't wait till someone makes this a wicked Dance video.
poet some clothes on
Yall are slow she stole the melody from a children’s tv show and put different words in it.
The same thing is going to do the same thing in this video
I've never seen a country artist dressed like this! No Wonder she doesn't relate to country fans.
❤
0/10 song
No thanks  What a joke
Early 2024 vibes
I hate people that say they are a musician who can’t even write a single lyric, note, play a instrument or even choreograph a dance move.
Didn’t she just copy madonna? She made a country song in 2000. Trust me, Beyoncé can’t write lyrics, dance moves, notes or anything. She just copy’s other and says she’s original
That's too bad that she's the head a major sex trafficking system along with her husband. What's sad is that it's usually a woman that heads industries like this and perpetuates an oppressive system that men created. 😢 I used to really love her. But I do not condone slavery in any way! Im grieving the loss of what would have been a great woman. History will paint her in a very demonizing evil way. And it should. Hope she could prove us wrong. But so far she has not. Putting your head in the sand like an ostrich while pretending like nothing's happening is also still perpetuating and oppressive evil system. Just because you "didn't do anything" doesn't mean you're innocent in the matter. You were just complacent. Tisk tisk.
Her nipples are civered😅

Is this 2025's version of creative genius?
Je serai elle je mettrais directement mes nichons à l'air.
Creative 💩
How do they keep her nipples from popping out? I watched that clip 34 times and I still don't know. Are they glued to taped to the jacket?
Good song but video sucks
I hate her voice but this is a bop. What's wrong with me!?
I worked with Recon.  I’m so grateful for everything he taught me, but more importantly he was an unbelievable friend. Working with him was one of the highlights of my 25+ year career.
Ssadss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😿
Juin 2025 ??? ❤
This sucks, I'm out.
country music is not for you
GAY
She's one of gay z's help and you call them your family , even if I'm telling you I don't want you , why would you still f with them ?

trash
Beyoncé: "There's a tornado in my city, don't you dare look at my....."
Excellent 👌
Incrrr❤
❤❤❤
💯
I came here as a country song fan just to see what best country album of the year was all about. This is not only a joke, but a disgrace. Stop sexualizing our young women too, you obviously don't know country
Kobiety.
❤
This is a slap in the face for country music !
Absolutely tremendously treble 😢, she ruined country music
Love her❤
The kid’s Snakeskin video came out excellent! 😎
Disgusting
Dog this is not country this is county
Just my personal opinion:-  The video let the song down.  It's the same thing over and over.  Once you've seen it, you've seen it.     Shame that she couldn't have had a true cow girl style with the accompanying dance and dancers.
I love Beyoncé 💛
To ma być teledysk? Hahaaaaa😅😅😅
Ty máš holé prsa 😮
3:19 best part of the song 🔥
wtf

Great song but country music? 😂 SMH definitely not, who's classifying music? I hope wardrobe didn't get paid because seriously, that little bit of material is a complete waste of effort. 😂 Pop music, pop video, Skippy wardrobe, someone has no clue what country music is.
Gotta tell ya...I had my doubts...but this IS country.

Im dance shcool
Don't blame other countries for using weapons. Here it is shown that Texas is one of the gangster states. She is honouring them.
I don't give a ratz... I love her voice and style. She could sing circles around Dolly-what's - name!"
Lindee 1:26
She is so overrated This song sucks ass and is definitely not a country song .😂
Burger cooked to perfection with the best chef money could afford.
Ribenna kwanza kwa chupa ya glass
Thus song is country bull s... ! It stupid and sounds terrible . And I don't care how many teeny bopper fans she has. Didn't even listen to the whole song.
Rainhaa❤

The fact that people think this is country music honestly amazes me...
Fine Young Cannibals - She Drives Me Crazy
😢😅😢😅😢😅😂
I had no idea she was still trying to sell her body for money
That's  not country song
Heeeee c'eeeeest Franklinnnnnnn
🚩
LOL! If she’s a “cowboy”then I’m the Man in the Moon! Black people can’t be cowboys, it’s that simple.
This is trash and disrespectful to country music. If a country star switch genres to R&B it would be called cultural appropriation.
this is one of the worst and cringiest songs ever
🕴🕺'📡🔊🌎😍🔊❤Love❤
En serio está hermoso esto Me gusta esta canción que ponga otra otra me encanta porque es modo fachero parece por qué yo es instagram y Giovanni en instagram para bailar esas canciones que me encantan tanto❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Diva é diva
She sings like she's a bored old lady who can't dress herself.....oh wait...
People with talent don't need to expose them selves!  She is disgusting!  And can't sing!  What a hag!

How about you guy actually try a real country music star Mickey Guyton - Better Than You Left Me. Because Beyoncé  WILL NEVER BE COUNTRY SINGER SHE A POP STAR

Beyonce tour breaking records, still time to get on the bandwagon. Lol
Damn Beyoncé✨
I was never a fan of Beyoncé but this track blew me away

This is just a gospel song from church replaced with a whore
Horrible la música muy sencilla
June 2025
It is bad that spotify has high premic views of this song but in youtube, this song has not hit 100 million
The fact she got an award she didn't deserve 😂
sorry, but soft porn is not country...she is a bad example for women
Thank for the look
FGS you are a 40 something year old mother of 3 😮You are talented and famous. Have respect for your kids and cover up the old ****Keep your clothes on! There’s nothing to see here.

Just nasty pure filth
This is horrible. She is too vulgar for country music. Bye
Beyonce should have never done country music. She doesn't suit it
THE GREATEST ❤
AOTY❤
People are blowing sunshine up her ass pretending her Diddy Jay Z and the whole industry is not self entitled psychopath, satanic idols that people fall down and worship
Vraiment je kiffe grave !🎉🎉🎉 Thanks You Beyoncé 😉🥰❤❤❤
What kind of weed would Beyonce be smoking that would make her think she is a country singer
❤❤❤❤25
I really want tickets to cowboy Carter and all American rejects backyard party. I have south moon under cowboy boots
Mds para de mostrar os peitos 🤣🤣🤣🤣
And she ain’t olaying
Blocks one eye. Holds fingers like Baphomet
If this song was released 2 years earlier, it would’ve made a great theme song for WrestleMania 38 in Arlington!
That's not country, that's  pure unadulterated trash.
Danke
Dankr
Hahahahaha she done lost her damn mind...who told her this was a good idea?
How dare she Ho-ify country music with such a boring video!🤣 so much talent so little creativity. She was lazy with this……
Always had the argument about how country music was lame with the rest of my family..the fact that this song won best country song of the year proves my point..i play this on repeat with when I'm with my parents. They say, it is as bad as Baby Shark, and I just laugh and dance and say it's the country song of the year! Dance and enjoy!!  Now I can't go to Thanksgiving and Christmas parties
Horrible todo tu pinche álbum estúpida
WTF that video 😂😂😂
This gives a whole new meaning to ho down.
Nobody givzaschidt about Bouncy. She needs to go hang out with diddy.

I like the song just Not the video 😮
Beyonce, may the Lord continue to bless and keep you and yours. All I ask and charge you with is caring for the babies. Don't lose focus of who you are and what you represent. Let the church say...
Innalillahi WA innailaihi rojiun RIP Mom 🎬
Girl you ain't been inside a dive bar since the first Clinton presidency
Give Billie her grammy.
Second location principle. Too bad we were still in Reston. Across from bar taco there’s a thing that records everything
Tony wishes I’d do that for him.
“I feel bad for tony” good for you in your stupid stalker red carpet wedding dresses.
I didn’t do anything to Alan or Ed but force them to face rejection like tony the stalker.
Goodde§
QUEEN =)
Who’s listening 2025?
This is by far the worst video I have ever seen. And the song isn't far behind it.
Da....faq

This is not country and western music.  This is new age music for gay  cowboys  It's just another song of repeat the same phrase over and over because it's good for business. That's what this is business.
This song is so corny, well her entire album is
Western : Hot. Sticky; Adventure; Deadly.  ■ A "Deadly ~ Sexy"  Gunfight! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠 ⚰️🪦⚱️⚰️🪦⚱️⚰️🪦⚱️
I wish I was Beyonce, always
That's terrible put some cloths on girl
😂 and when your name is jolene everyone you meet is a singer lol
🔥
I’d say 66699
Slow dance huh if only u knew a dream as if I’ve done
❤
THIS AINT ZIMBABWE!
I am blessed. I am blessed that growing up on Beyoncé makes me feel lucky. Thank you B for shaping a big part of who I am today❤
What a sellout. Just for...well you know who runs the industry.......money money money
This song gives me energy to get up and handle my business ASAP!
Hi
Me am watching this today
Horrible
And I wasn’t never married and I’m a woman
Well done, evolution, very well done indeed!
Almost putting this song in ROUND ROCK TX
Nope and all y’all world wide fucked up
And I’m telling on all y’all and I walk and I’m single
And I ain’t playing
B your beautiful but you dont have to share your body with the world to prove it……
Biyonce,s❤
Biyonces❤
Slaying ateeeeeeee upppppp😊😊😊
Garbage
La bande de sont parfaites pour...danser🎉❤💃😂
You have to be kidding! Country? Tit's hanging out, gross.
And I’m Rachelle
HUMAN TRAFFICKER. YOURE GOING DOWN YOU 🗑
Beyonce plays cowgirls and now suddenly every black person is a cowboy/cowgirl🙄
Sounds good on mute
Soooo....  If I do a rap song, talking about f**king b**ches, smoking dr*gs and stealing money, then say Jesus at some point in an adlib, does that make it a gospel song? 🤔  Country, this is not. Not that I don't believe she could do it, but putting a banjo or violin in your instrumental does not make it country. And how many "country folks" drive a Lexus? Answer : zero. Go sit in the corner, dumba**es.  I'll accept her as a "country artist" or "multiple genre artist" when she works with Dolly, Reba, Alan Jackson, Darius Rucker, Jason Aldean, or Trace Adkins.  I listen to most genres, and am a fan of Kane Brown, Krizz Kalico, Eminem, Ozzy, Linkin Park, Carrie Underwood, Daddy Yankee, Morgan Wallen, Miranda Lambert, Don Omar, Hospin, Intocable, Nickelback, Trace Adkins, and 3 Doors Down. But as a person with more than 2 brain cells to rub together, I'll openly admit when they make a crappy / bad song.  Beyonce, you can do better than this sh*t.
Dang I thought she would be doing the hoedown one step to the right very disappointed she could have taught me line dancing 😞
This song is AZZZZ
Crap 😢
Lunch⏲️⏰🕰️⌚⏳
May da 12th... don't be a bitch!!!😎🎶🌱

I was told to speak up before Desiree Baiamonte steals my life from me and Dustin Riggio said it's his job in life to make me miserable the rest of my life oh my goodness Kay Lewis the knot prayer rosary I got my boots on the ground st Michael the archangel straight from heaven with me and my family praise God
Producer umm so what are we going to do for the video  Beyoncé we have to do a video   Producer um yes  Beyoncé fine her let me show you what we are going to do   Dose this

Hot
I love this music❤❤❤🎉my daughter love it too 🤗
Jo Shania,das passiert wenn man sich jahrelang zurück zieht!
Amooooooo
Bo Burnham warned us about this.
This is ridiculous I can't even watch the whole video, she looks  pathetic
I don't believe anyone is really listening to the song.  Just looking at her half naked body.  Why is nudity necessary?  It's nasty and tacky.   Beautiful voice, nice song, attractive woman.  Unnecessary nudity. To those of you who keep trying to be sarcastic and calling me names, if you're not a Christian who believes in decency, don't bother responding.  I'll continue deleting your responses that are filled with spite, anger, and the need to provoke others.  Everyone should have the right to post their views free of threats, name calling and derogatory statements.  Have a nice day and Beyonce', try to stay warm.
wonder if she can stay on a bull longer than 8 seconds
hope you saved yer money!.... you DONE
I cant stand her or her lame ass husband butt buddy to diddy
beyonce singing country?!?!   wouldn't these super lefty's call this cultural appropriation???????!!!???
J'aime beaucoup ❤❤❤
Elle a besoins d'être quasiment à poil ?!
So stupid lol
Sonhei com as Fadas do Bem que acompanham a Beyoncé
Magnifique ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠j'aime beaucoup les chansons de Beyoncé 😊
This is how you do shit for less than $100 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo soy fannnnnnnn de ellaaaaaa
This is the worst song I have ever heard. It does something to my brain. You could torture me for days, pull my nails, cut of my limbs. Put this song on and I would fold before the intro was done playing.
Let’s officially make this the most disliked video of all times on YouTube.
Is her right breast larger than her left?
Catchy. It Grew on me lol
Good song, stupid video.
🇺🇸🪽
No.. just no.. this is an insult to the county music industry.  Beyonce, stick to your style. Dont try to be like someone youre not. Ill give you a d- for effort but please, for the love of god, please, save your career, stay away from ever making country music again.
I take shits more talented than Beyonce
This is more bluegrass than country, needs it's own category like black country.
Country hip hop fusion...I wonder where she got the idea? 🤔🤔🤔🧐🧐🧐❤️❤️❤️☺️☺️☺️
This song is trash and almost ruined country music she should take this down to save our ears
Chris brown lyrics residuals
Love
You're telling me this is better than HIT ME HARD AND SOFT
Extreme Garbage.
And Beyonce thinks she's a country singer all of a sudden. Why exactly? I'm not a big country fan. But what the fuck is this? Absolute dogshit
shes the best
I shed a red tear from my ear
yes
You still got it pretty girl we see you.
Hi 52nd Allah

Well;, it's not Coal Miners Daughter, Blue, Stand By Your Man, Crazy, or Jolene, but it is definitely a country song by a female singer. However, it won't win any awards. Well, maybe a Grammy, but what do they know about country music?
❤May 2025!!!
Isso não é um vidioclip...com certeza.
About the songs that her is Beyonce 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😮😮😮😮😂😂😂
She is very Patty ❤❤❤❤

Congratulations Mrs Beyonce '  !!!

So kid friendly! Know you know. Wait there is all of social media with the same influence! Fore sure you know now!!! Get your teen boys out to work. And NO we all know your not in or from Texas! Those who are have more class. The only B$/$h and trash is you and your hubby, know your praying the Didddy files don't come out!! Know we don't need to pray for that! We already know!!
Good song, but it ain't country music.
💃🏾
Trash song, artist, and person.
The music is good but I hate what the producer did..... LIKE WHAT THE FLIP MAN AND ITS ALSO JUST REPEATING! AND... I like the clothes okay..... But why does she have to look like this tbh💀 SHE IS LITTERALY LOOKING SO REVEALING AND IM SORRY BUT SEEING SOMEONE WEAR REVEALING CLOTHES ANGER ME BECAUSE IT'S SO GROSS!
Clean up the language, stop dressing trashy.
Trash
THIS IS SUCKS!! 🤢
Boys and girls slipin, ma ma have night shift
Country music is about LIFE NOT flash and Gash.  She needs to Go Home And Rethink her Life.
🤠 YEE HAW
She is brave wearing that
Love this song
I Love Country Music,  but don’t this way😮
Essa mulher faz tudo para aparecer 😂😂

Anyone here in 2025 april July 4th
Not even close to real country  music.. no mention  of trucks  or beer or shooting your wife because  it's texas
Beyonce, I made a filter for your new video.  I saw it in visualizer form and not already, but I bought all of your songs and rights with it.  I invite you to share with my free collective.  https://youtube.com/shorts/0EKVAK2AJYY?si=FsRgGdyz-EJ-jvGl

It's tractor rap  Not country,,, it's still pop..   Just cause you put an acoustic in a track don't make it country..  It's still hip hop I say this about all the white wanna be country as well so no race cards you fucks..  It's called tractor rap
you go girl just found this you country girl country is great must keep it up
Why aren’t the other artist listed as feature artists?… her and Drake move the same way. I would have said no. I want my name on the song. People need to stop worshipping this woman and start thinking with their pockets like she does.
Reminds me the 1980's!
I Really like this tune!!!
I Know! Right?
SO LAY YOUR CARDS
Oh oh oh hey

If you think this is country music in the slightest, dont consider yourself country 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm going to dance it for Mother's Day and it's about jeans.
Why so many bad comments? I agree that this is the worse "country" i ever heard but...
Tbh this just a jackin off vid for the guys on repeat. Gives me the ick. Great song bad whatever this is.
Anyone 2025
May God forgive you.
Y ppl try to make country music when yall not even a country person smh
I love this song. So does my dog. It doesn't matter where she is or what she's doing,, when she hears the first note she comes running to dance with me. It only lasts a short time but, I find it hilarious!

It came to the prophets through the angels, we got it, the religion of the Torah engine of the Quran is the same system.People know everything, I repeat, if the laws of Quran/Bible/Torah cannot be established on earth, then there will be no peace in the minds of the people of the world. same law in bookAllah first created Adam then He created Hawa we were in Paradise. After eating wheat Allah created this world to take us to Paradise through testing you forgot.isa musi/Jesus will come back......Allah one .. the king of king allah 🔱 الله আল্লাহ अल्लाह..Say, o prophet,"He is Allah -one and indivisible; Allah- the sustainer `needed by all'.He has never had offspring,nor was he born.and there is none comparable to Him"1❤❤❤

This video hit 64M views than her other songs??? This means they ain't here for her song, but for her breast waiting for the vest to malfunction and not even realizing it's on replay😂  Her Other songs on the album only have 5M views and she only have 27M subs. but this rocketed to 64M?! WTF 😂it's really because of the breast.
Slay❤

That vest is more trustworthy than anyone
Anyone in 2025😂 👇🏻👇🏻
I am a straight woman. But my  goodness she is the shit 🎉❤😂
You do realize if this is supposed to be country this is bottom of the line at best right? This is shit and you should be sad that this even got an award for what is  supposedly country. The people that praise this are an embarrassment to what country is supposed to be for a genre.
2024 alguem?
no wonder she won AOTY she doesnt deserved it

i'm a punk rock, 60's garage/psychedlia, obscure nuggets & cowboy country fan...this song is great & if you think this is not country, this is more "country" than the mainstream pop-country garbage we've been force-fed these last 15+ years or whatever.
Make soviet union great again 🚩👨‍❤️‍👨🇺🇲
A Beyoncé country line dance hit was not on my bingo card for 2024 😂 BUT IM HERE   Beyoncé has more trust in that vest jacket, than i have in my life  Edit:I think I started a war in the reply section

Dumbest thing I ever seen , what a disgrace
This old horse is played out.
I think her breast's are real sorry jay didn't mean 2 look
beyonce doesn't have the soul for country!. she is not an artist, this is just cheap pop gimmicks and sexualised to make up for the fact that she hasn't got the goods so can't deliver it.
Ужасная песня
Peinlich, so peinlich. Eine erwachsene Frau spielt das was seltsames. Wo sind bloß die guten Autoren für. Videoclips hin?
Amazing song❤
Nah but its crazy how this song was so trendy and popular in early 2024 and you never come across it in 2025.
Just awful and this is coming from a native Texan.
Anyone in 2025 ❤
I like taylor Swift, then I listened  this song and I thought omg 😂😂😂
No way this is the best country album💔💔
This is country???
Who edit video like this.?? Need internet connection
Why do they keep feeding and get killed in the end
❤❤❤❤
The devil inside...
If I was a country artist I would have her band definitely
It's disrespectful towards country music artists she could have did a better job she was super lazy on this video I don't even know what this video is she's doing the same move over and over. And it's almost like she's making fun of country music in general like she doesn't know anything about country it's disgusting

Just had to taint  the country world with that creepy outfit and glasses.
Her winning a country album is a joke
This woman is so damn beautiful
And you’re telling me this was a better country artist than shaboozey……. He should’ve won the judges of the emmies sold because no one offends beyouncé fuck this is trash
Enserio Esto ganó como álbum del Año
Country Paris Couture

Is this a copy of the cannon ball song with different lyrics?
This is not even close to "Country"! We don't do half naked videos or call men bitches! Girl bye!
I love you Beyoncé ❤
Why she nude
Great artist and preformer. But this is not country.
Honey the rest of the album is good but this song isn’t it 😭🪫🪫🥀🥀
Perfect song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Que música ruim  credo,como isso ganhou o Osca
Why did they just have her do the same thing over and over?
Isn’t she married…..what is that jacket?!?!
I don’t really get the point of this video. It’s just the same scene over and over. 🙄
BROOOO U SUCKKKKK
She's such a talentless joke.

drake is guna perform the world cup is too much. that's the big three. bee kdot n arbrey
Bro she should be banned her outfit is very inappropriate
Sit around making fun of country “people” she doesn’t belong here and she knows it, she had to get a whopping 70 people to help her make this album bc it’s not in her wheelhouse, you know how many people worked on Taylor Swifts last album?? SEVEN!! Bc she didn’t need a whole mess of people to tell her how to write, compose and sing the type of music she has been singing her whole life.
No one's perfect
Disgusting
Seriously what is wrong with music nowadays 🙄 remember the times when Michael Jackson was creating mini movies to his songs, every single one was unforgettable. This looks so cringe and boring 😬
You DID NOT DESERVE THAT AWADR AT ALL. ! Its a disgrace and insult to real country music. Its not a trend
Sex and killing. That’s what this video “Visualizes”. And that patch…what does that Illuminate?
https://youtu.be/CJ3slZsxLLQ?si=NcqmjB2N9L1v0edg so cuntry!!
This is the closest anyone has seen her #####
Im not watching this. Keep your clothes on sweetie. Stay in your lane. Your voice is beautiful in your lane. You made a fool of yourself doing something that doesnt fit you. Not everyone wants to see you naked sweetie. Keep your clothes on. Sing your songs you love. You dont have to proove anything to anyone. You have a beautiful voice. God bless you. 🎉🎉🎉
Where's her clothes? This pretty close porn, but then rihanna wore lingerie outside while pregnant
Garbo
She looks ridiculous!!! Pay attention people..this ish ain't normal!! Not about music just cash!!!! Fkn sad!!
Shes a shameful example for a woman. Zero self respect. Put some effin clothes on. Sorry, she isnt country.
this is so sad
We need a part 2 of Telephone from Lady Gaga and Beyoncé; it would be too iconic.
❤ ❤
💃 💃 💃 ❤🐝
I actually like this song 🎵
So sexy and
wtf three whole minutes with that. lol  Thank good for photoshop skills, or her nipples will be out there. Or tape?
Not country. Put some clothes on.
shit goes hard on mute
CAROLINE  LEA
Anyone march 2025
That’s country ? Lmao what a joke.
Idkkkkk like it lottt
This is the song that won😂😂😂.
She is OVERRATED
Billie Eilish the best
Really album of year? HIT ME HARD AND SOFT IS IN BETTER
I DON'T F**** FREE
What do I get
I don't care how much backlash I get but you can't make a country song with cuss words in it. Sorry Beyonce but that's not how country rolls. Also this in my opinion is worst song I ever heard from her. No hate just stay in your lane (btw the way before you say this is racist im black)  I like country the way is no cussing. You can't call it a country song if there's cussing in it. If you look at all the country songs there's not one cuss word in them. Stay with the hip hop genre.

This is nothing but a pile of shit and Beyonce rolling it expecting us to like this shit
Beyonce's the queen of country music. stop whining you cry babies. ❤️❤️
This AIN'T COUNTRY, and neither is she... what a damn joke ya'll voted this crap best album. Stay in your lane lady, pop r&b garbage
Where is the appropriate cowboy outfit? Why is she naked? 🤣🤣
This issue of black musicians undressing themselves  in public and music videos is totally crap especially for her age
Aku rasa konsepnya sama dengan video klip Niki yang Lowkey Yang terus di ulang dan di ulang
This is the best country song ever!
Was she watching too much terminator movies lol The video is senseless.has no meaning.
Does that Lexxxis have a Manic Trunk with a lot of junk LMFDEAOO 😂
Where ❤
Maybe I’m just jaded because I grew up listening to country music. I’m not saying she isn’t a talented singer but this ain’t country.
City people when they find out Texas isn’t the only state that doesn’t do county music: 😮😮😮
💩💩💩🚽
Just because Texas is in the title doesn’t mean it’s a country song.
I can see her knickers?
That clothe does not go with that song
why does this song sounds like liv is  ❤❤😂😂singing it
Not gunna lie I thought this would be a disaster but I really liked it 👍
They are only displaying her cleavage to get the ratings because the song sucks.
I don't think country people like the video.  They might find it insulting.  I am brutally honest,  sorry. That shit ain't pretty.  😮 😅 But if this video was well known when "Yellowstone"  was still on it would have been better.
Didn't deserve a grammy
It's not country singing
I love this song!😂
This is damn trash Totally sucks
. En serio no había más imágenes... DISCO DEL AÑO . Lo siento BILLY😢
Right She keeps doing the same thing
She knows..)
I knew jay z would get out of the debacle.
She’s so hot 🔥😘🥹😍
I love Beyoncé I think she’s such a queen
Leo’s ex: “Ed seems lovely”
So there’s a connection b/w Lacey of paper moon and Ed? Okay.
Exactly.
Oh this song is for me Thanks B ❤
HMHAS trash album of the year. Beyoncé is more successful 💋
Terrible and half naked can you not do anything without showing her body and this dam sure isn't country
How the fuck is this even country 😂😂😂
maybe this ain't texas but it's definitely BUNS HMHAS ALBUM OF THE YEAR
Well, she's beautiful and I love this song and her voice, but as a clip it's so boring...🫡
2025 anyone?
Love the song but shoulda left that costume in Diddys closet
Trash
No, this is like legitimately really good.
I do not care for country, nor do I care for these nasty comments. But because I grew up around country, I know when I hear a catchy country tune. I love this… it may not be your normal to the others, but I am very appreciative of your flexibility with music, it gives me a new perspective.  This is a beautiful piece that you sang your heart out to, and I feel like more people should appreciate it for just what it is. 🔥💚🔥
What a joke
I don't like country music but this is a pile of shit I really think Christian rock might be better and I've only heard 30 seconds of the song
This song is so shitty it doesn't deserve a Grammy
0:00 Check out the meme I just made up here "hora se for dinheiro eu não tenho"😂😂😂😂😂😂
First of all, we don’t need the language. I was open minded. I gave it a chance because I felt there was a lot of hate toward her but a lot of foul language and is there a reason why she’s feels it’s necessary not to wear a shirt is this what she thinks country music is foul language in partial nudity I’m not impressed and I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.
Love this song 🎵 ❤️
❤🎉 #T58XAStrendingshort
Terrible sorry
Such a stupid video. It irritates me to watch it. So close my eyes and listen. That works.
personally this song isn’t country…want reallllll country listen to riley green, zach bryan, the red clay strays, aaron watson, cody johnson, miranda lambert, carrie underwood, and whiskey myers.
So frrrrr❤❤❤ love ya Beyoncé
203 1
So we have no bra and repeated pew pew fingers. Very futuristic country. Which means we're all f*cked.
That's not country
Oh look, Epstein lists released today. Guess whose names are not on it? Stop the hate.
country will never been my thing NOT even with Beyonce LOL
hate country
WT-fudge
💩
See is slaying
Laura Rutledge.... This one has a dance, and a this ain't texas. ohhh. Hoedown.... 🎉 She cool. 😊
Shut! This folks is the horn with the crown on the sea monster straight out of Revalations.
If she wore more clothes and didn't call the guy a b!tch, this would be a country song for the ages. I love this song. I'm just sayin'.
Oh shit B. I bet rihana will devorce \ i'm just a M.f, YOU GOT THE HORMONES, NO  SEXY ANYMORE
Wow beyonce! This saved my paralyzed grandpa, i turned this song on and he woke up to turn it off!
Creator ❤❤❤✝️✝️✝️✝️🙏🙏🙏
She sucks at all music
❤

Ho down 😮😅My sister I pray for you! Amen ❤👆✌️ I pray your leg infection gets better and you get back up
lol trash
Why does Beyonce make her skin lighter ?
Este vídeo me gusta, es muy del oeste.
Love this tune
😂😂 showroom no stockroom
Ona się wybielila? Przecież była taka dumna z bycia afroamerykanka.
Sex sells.
Why does she has to be almost naked in so many of her music videos?
Sparkling "snake" on the left side of the black glasses? Illuminati
Love this song
Beyonce is a musical genius
Country porn?
I think she needs to stay in her lane. Not singing vountry.
Babe Beyoncé this is so beautiful
I love her so much 💜💜
Edit something else
Texas❤
Call baby girl❤
Sad to say this Is in a country album and she won against Chris Stapleton, it’s not a country song, says the same two lines the whole song, shit stupid and if u listen to the lyrics she just throwing shit together nothing about this song makes sense
Take a picture. I have to drive I don't crack❤
Send text message to my wife❤
She forgot to dress!
march 2073 anyone?
Bc you love watching lab animals
Demnächst beklagt, sie das man sie auf Arsch und Titten reduziert!  Wenn Frauen etwas erreichen wollen machen sie ALLES, wenn sie alt oder ein wenig was erreicht haben, wollen sie wegen für angeblicher Intelligenz dauergelobt werden!!
And the grammy goes to Carboard-Cowboy carter
She wouldn't last out in the country dressed like that. It's ugly. It's not even a country song. Give it up girl.
😂
This is Texas, yes hold them.
Stupid she won she ain’t country Chris Stapleton should have won
THIS AINT COUNTRY , IT SUCKS , WHOO
Les amis anglophones Beyonce reste Beyonce. N'oubliez pas que Michael Jackson a été traité de tout et pourtant il n'a jamais été condamné. En tout cas, en France je m'ambiance dessus
Everything, every song ,  revolves around jesus sacrifice.
Very aggravated about so called country artists dissing her. They weren't mainstream either when they started. They should reach out as shes bringing new fans . Country needed shakeup for years. They didnt say a word when Shania came on board. She wasnt traditional either.
XSPB 3
Country at its best
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Song is done well.  I enjoyed her voice, more than the song.  I didn’t care for her outfit.  Should have been more of a cow-girl style ( like that white-laced outfit). But, no matter what I think?  Beyoncé’s talent speaks for itself.
Thank you beyoncé❤❤❤❤❤ for this sound🤍🤍🤍
ini lagu enak bgt gila, tapi banyak yang fomo jadi di jelek jelekin 😭😭😭
TRASH. Good thing your man had millions to buy your way to the top huh?
What the hell
JUST TASTLESS!
LEGEND HAS IT BEYONCE AND JAY Z LOVE AAAAAYYYEEEEEE MINORSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
Why not do a proper video this is dumb
She's gross
She knows nothing about country music. Song sucks
Sex
If this is the best song in 2024, then I'm a fucking rebirth of Jimi Hendriks, Alexi Laiho and Stevie Ray Vaughan
The song is fine but the video is horrible other than those big jugs they want us to focus on...  🤦
She aint no country girl. And she definitely aint no country singer. Lame attempt for lefties to infiltrate country music to steal the electorate.
Omg you are not country and cover your body also
Hilarious
Wow they went all out on this film clip. Must of been years in the making and so artistic. I am very impressed
THIS IS EFFING TERRIBLE HORRIBLE AWFUL STUFF!
if this is country,  democrats love trump and the titanic sank cause it was just tired of floating
I like it.
Omg, I'm sorry I even came here to hear this crap! I guess you really can buy an award
Not country at all ....its a disgrace when so many others were truly worthy ....
Nope
This song is a tik Tok trend not a Grammy winner tbh it's pretty ass

So, now she sucks in two music types.
What A fucking  kick in the teeth to  actually country singers.👎
I didn’t like knowing she used curse words in a country song . I’m Asian I’m from Oregon I’m 40 years old and during that era we lived near all the farms to buy live stock meat at farmers market where all the white people went and their music grew onto me . Everything that they played . Oregon is all developed now though I’m sure most of them moved to red states . It’s was crazy how my dad would walk into a farmers market where there’s confiderate flags everywhere and somehow started a live stock business with them and didn’t realize what that flag meant lol 😂all I remember was when my dad best friend would always tell them he’s with me that’s when we got accepted so I got to see a lot of live shows of a lot of up coming artist that were doing country music . Oregon farmers market at the time was like going to the state fair or going to a Hispanic open door swap meat it was fun . Reason why I said all that is because Beyoncé voice isn’t made for that type of music . Shaboozey is though he’s really good
Dumbest video of all time. Not counting the phoned in lyrics.
Mama u gonna make loose my job❤
I was skeptic after hearing she won country album, but can't believe it's really good.
No country at all
Beyonce got that award DEI!!
Rubbish
The queen of country music.❤️❤️❤️❤️
Noooooooooooooo🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
💥 Love this💖
Maybe if she dreessed a little more appropriate and traditional  instead of being half neckedd... i yi yi...horrible video!!!
This video is absolute shit !!! Seriously 😳 no talent in it at all!!! 😭
Not all that bad but not spectacular. Video is terrible.
Validated
Yea idk what country y’all living in but this isn’t Country this is just sad try again but please don’t hoes being hoes lmao😂
This song is so bad should not have won it’s a joke
Should have gone to someone with actual talent like Shaboozey. She’s as overrated as the Kardashians and Taylor Swift. 🥱🙄😒
How did this win a Grammy?🤣🤣this is terrible worst song I’ve heard in my life, no wonder she fell off so hard,she’s just rich that’s the only reason she’s still making songs and buying her listeners🤣no one actually even listens to her no more though,judging by this song I can see why that is
This song sucks this not country go back to hip hop!
This is Trash 🗑️
🫠🫠🫠
Black redneck pop. Speechless Shit
There is lack of diversity
the song: 😄 the video💀
Yawn
It's like terminator meets breast line
How do you rhino this is country,wtf!!!!
You suck. This ain't even music. My ears bled just listening to it for 5 seconds.
It’s like Peewee Herman singing Rap
Sucks
Wtf did i just watch this isnt right 😡 definitely no country music
I'm in Liverpool and I'm going to Texas
wtf is this bro
Absolutely beautiful 🤩 can fr tell she from Texas 😊
This is pure garbage
MAMA
❤
This trash not country music and Beyonce should a shame of herself not just disrespecting the country community but her own community too but I guess pedophiles bishes like Beyonce can do whatever she wants
She’s certainly a risk taker in that outfit. I’m so jealous think she’s great !!!
Open a little more jacket😂😂😂😂
Jeeeeeez,….WTF 😉😜 This song isn't even in the top 500 country songs, let alone win a Grammy or any other award
this is really bad
00:13
This isn't country, this is a pop imitation of country music.
Patsy Cline is rolling in her grave. Just because she can sing a song doesn't mean she should.
Worlds dumbest video.
Copiona p i r a t a, es la canción de Franklin y sus amigos, no tienes talento
This isn’t country!
Stupid video
Why the fuck does she thinks she country
This album is so dumb 😅
Because she is a one trick pony.
First time actually searching this up and listening to it and its so 🗑️💀
Wtf even is this 😂😂😂😂😂 nice try 😂😂😂 definitely wasnt worth a grammy!!!
Grammy album of the Year.❤️❤️. Grammy country music album of the Year ❤️❤️. Yeehaw!!
What a load of shit.
The worst song i ever heard
Cant believ this won album of the year. Bfr grammys 🤦🤦😐
Super cette choregraphie ❤
I don't know 😐😐
This is a queen trying to get her crown back she's been irrelevant for a long time now ...she got what she wanted ppl talking about her ..... But country ppl want her to get back in her own lane and I don't disagree
"To you, a complete stranger who shares the same space in this world. Wishing you good health, peace and success in all areas of your life. Live life to the fullest, love sincerely and don't be afraid to open your heart to new things. I hope that despite the difficulties, you will always find hope and light ahead."
This stinks.
Trash 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Bro... this is a weak song
For all those crying about being snubbed at the CMTs. It takes more than a banjo riff and a few "woooos" to make a country song.
Solo quiero agradecer a beyonce , no quiero tener mala suerte 😢
Love the finger guns!!!
Omgg girl your hair!!
Theres nothing country about this...real country is raw, authentic, imperfect, rooted in values and a lifestyle, her vocals are WAY too polished and produced to be remotely country...its an OK song but has no place in the country genre except as a lame attempt at a cheap imitation.....to put this song in the same category as Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire is insulting to what makes country unique
This is garbage
She çould have dressed well
The song is ok at best but this video is absolutely 100% shiit!!!!
Trash ass song
A real life boogey
She can't sing or dance ! Plus she's not COUNTRY  😅😂😅😂
Just came on here to say ...THIS SONG SUCKS not even going to listen ..she should never won award for best country album that shit was rigged
nulle ce clip
Der Song ist wirklich gut… weshalb so ein Video ? 🤷🏻‍♀️
That 'visualizer' is disgusting, we are looking at a mother here, of a twelve year old.
Um.....bless her, i don't want to speak bad of someone 🙈 but.... EVERYONE behind the scenes and the public knew she doesn't have a country genre voice!??? Her voice had always been pop or R&B etc ... The record company seem currupt now too 🤦🏼‍♀️ this is insulting to the real country singing talents 😬😬 shame on the record company
Rubbish 👎🏼 why dress half naked, it's because it sells them not their singing. Embarrassing herself.
She knows... She knows 2 pac Blood of childs Beyoncé is a sadic dark person
Worst country song ever wtf is this
Beyonce is inspired. She has art to make.
How does this thing win country awards
Now was this the song that won't hurt a country music award.
I'm not winning a grammy
She does the same thing and repeats the same shit.get a life
Too old for looking like a h o e!
her pew pew
Smash hittt
Doesn’t deserve a Grammy but she’s a Texas girl, tf y’all mean she can’t sing country music?
😃🌺💕❤️🎉🥰🌹🤗😊
Very veryyyy gooood job 😃🌺🌸💓❤️♥️💕
Perfect soundtrack for ovserving the rife...
And she beat Taylor how not that I really like Taylor but Taylor is way better
Wow.. jay z really bought beyonce grammy award for this shit
Billie should have won ffs.. wt f is this? Lol
The Grammy’s are blatantly rigged
That outfit is not fit for country...disgusting😢 you don't need to do this if you have talent...
Such an amazing song! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don't like it. Nope
Old lady PLEEZ act your age😢
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Country music without the "o".
Awards in America are rigged
I absolutely detest this song!
Listen to this and then listen to Wildflower by Billie Eilish and tell me with a straight face that Billie wasn’t robbed. What a joke
shyte
This looks like some proper apocalyptic shit. Lets be honest, if it came to the mad max shit, jay z would definitely be fucking kayne
That woman has more confidence in that vest than I do in the niners next season (iykyk) bang bang niner gang for life WHERE ARE MY NINER FAITHFULS
I believe they do listen though.  I checked that album and it said it contain texas hold em and that song quite addictive.
…and you say this is country? Gosh. This Grammy country award is a slap in the face of the hard working country artistes. This is nothing near country. In fact, this is nothing near good music.
🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂😂
Well if this is country music then take me back to George Straight and Hank Williams Sr and Jr country music ain't no half naked woman it's music you can dance to and feel in your soul it's a way of life to be country
Cancion del culooooo
That’s not a f country music, lyrics are so dumb
Temazo ❤
Open your legs and we'll see it all after that walk onto stage.. disgusting
pew pew
0:29
Grammy for loser
Listened to the song for the first time- it’s great 👍 But where are the cowboy boots and a jeans jacket?
This song makes me want to binge eat
She won over Billie eilish seriously! And over other country singers!! You know the s***'s rigged!!! Let's destroy the last bit of Diddy there is and that's this crap. It's not a terrible song but it shouldn't have won a Grammy It sounds like the second track you would have on a CD that has better songs
Cuntry music?
Jay-Z paid more than $20 million to country radio stations to play Beyonce songs so she'd top the Billboard Country Charts.
Okay maybe I'll go against the tide, but aside from everything that's being said about her... I love this song.  It's not my favorite (that's Whatever Happens if you were wondering... I know you don't care) but I loved it anyway. I'm just sorry about the music video. That one is terrible for me. But the song is catchy and has an easy to remember melody.   And did she deserve to win?  I don't know. I didn't watch the awards, so I don't know what other songs she was competing with. But it's definitely the best Beyoncé song, at least in my opinion.  Resp one of the best.   But if you're wondering why she won... come on, people.  It's Beyonce. We know who she was mixing coffee with XD XD XD XD Either way she would have won XD
This cover is not country.  She is talented but should probably stick with what she's good at.
Wtf is this????? She should stay in the music she's known for
Am I the only one who actually likes this song? 😂 I know it’s not really country, just a bit of a country vibe to it. Or do y’all just hate her?
I'm not t sure if I'd call it country, it's closer to a soul sound but kinda gets ruined with banjos. I listen to everything, but this isn't for me.
Stupid ass song. 😂
Video is trash.
Oh shit,part of my playlist,good song woman
I think she deserves the trophy in the end
Lady you got 3? shows what we black can do?
I’m sure she goes to dive bars
Great song shite video
What in the world has happened to Country music? I don't think we will ever see Beyonce at the Grand Ole Opry!!
How the fuck did this win country album of the year? It’s not country at all it’s pop with a guitar 😂 very disappointed in the music industry
It looks like a street hooker not close to country music
🤔 Reminds me that beyoncé and Jay z have enough to pay all 13,000 members who voted for this to be album of the year! Billie Eilish was so much more deserving than this crap! What the hoe down is going on? 😡
Im so confused
Her wearing that outfit is in hopes to distract people from hearing right.
This shit sucks😂😂😂
Why is this a Grammy winner for one it needs to rewrote “This ain’t country”
Beyoncé, I congratulate you on your hard-fought and well-earned, and well-deserved Grammy Award for Album of the Year that you won this year with Cowboy Carter. However, since you collaborated with Lady Gaga, the Antichrist and girlfriend of Judas Iscariot, on her song Telephone (and also because you also performed some of the songs that were used in the misogynistic, BDSM-promoting Fifty Shades of Grey film), all of your #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits since July 2005 (except for Perfect Duet with Ed Sheeran) were at #1 for only one week; as such, Texas Hold 'Em was #1 for only one week last March. Its other week was held by Out of That Truck by Carrie Underwood, the Greatest Singer of All Time, instead. PS Screw Taylor Swift. She is now a tyrannical goddess of pop music.
Trashy!
Come to nodak if you want real country
I'm just listening to this song for the first time and I honestly don't see the fuss. I place it in the Country Pop category right along with Shania Twain music.  It's not that deep for the controversy.  Did she deserve a Grammys?  That's always debatable and possibly not but hey, we don't get a vote in it - I never pay attention to it anyway.  The video and outfit could have been better though.
Grammy album of the year. Country music album of the Year.❤️❤️
Billboard top female country artist of the year.❤️❤️
Stupid
Booooo
Embarrassing video of woman that tries so hard being white blond.  Embarrassing for all women of all colours. 😢
In Germany they play ts in 2025 at least two times a day 😭
Never did someone not deserve a Grammy more than Beyonce. No problem being called a bitch because this definately isn't Texas.
Its how she killed oll those people
that's it? that's the music that made her win country's grammy? sheet
Te la dedico
Hahaha  That's awful.
A 62 million views video wins Grammy? Even a 5y old could tell was rigged 😂
Why do singers in America show so much of they body ,,lm my day they would be called something else ,all most a soft porn show
Wtf is this shit
JUST BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT TEXAS DON’T MEAN IT’S A COUNTRY SONG!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The question is simple:  WHY
This is NOT country. That's it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 just NO!!! GET BACK IN YOUR LANE SWEETHEART!!!!
Does you get rewarded by producing a song like this ?!!! Yes its a nice song but not till tge point to win a Grammy 😅😅
Looks like those nude dance clubs , that don’t sound like country music.
There is nothing special about this song. It sounds more like pop than country.
Thats a disgrace to country music where the hell are your clothes and your curssing like a rap video put some freaking clothes on show some class if you have any good grief 👎👎👎im not talking about your voice just they way you are presenting yourself shameful
this shit is absolute ass bro how did this win
WTH WAS THAT? 😅😅😅
THIS won an award!? 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣
Someone needs to make a mashup of this song and "Let Your Love Flow" by the Bellamy Brothers.
Illuminati eye patch 🙄
Eww never
Well she didn’t have to learn many “moves”. They just keep using the same one over and over.
Sh.....
No texas 😂 only pop
garbage collection
Totally country outfit. She's on Diddy's list. She's on Epstein's list. She's a Freemason demon. Shout out to Aaliyah.
I wish she had some real talent. Even her little one lacks it. Such a shame
Nice, Love the song. It is alot more country then alot of the crap i hear on the radio these days.
How bad were the other country songs that this garbage beat?
Still dont know how this album who the grammy. Em was really right abt the Grammys. They only give grammies to their 'darlings'.💀
How’s it feel to buy a Grammy!! lol you ain’t been hot since tlc
You ain't no allie sherlock...she sings this song better
Georgia Loving it ❤🌴 😊
Bruh this shit song even worth a grammy lmao
I literally love this song for years and I’m just watching the video on YouTube. I was looking for this.
Delete this garbage money cant buy everything
Because she can because she's Beyonce!🎉
It’s been officially a year since this song dropped
she’s disgusting!!😡
Ya this doesn't sound like country it sounds like pop with country names
i hate beyonce more now that i see this dumb sh*t chris stapleton shoulda got a grammy because this aint country.
Really do enjoy this song; however do feel that the lack of clothing is not necessary. You are such a beautiful woman, don't sell yourself short.
Cowboy Carter has re-entered the top 10 on five billboard charts. Including top country albums.
billie deserved the grammy
This shit ain’t country
I’ve never seen Beyoncé so white washed in my life . . .
This song is a lot better than the sh!,t she usually releases
She sucks as a country singer 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Go B
This is trash
Cheesy to the core 😂
If this is what people consider country. Yall delusional lol
Not country
She making a porn calendar. Another DEI winner
Really inventive video      Not repetitive
This is country?  What country?  That song sucked and the video was worse
I hear “ she gives me money, when I’m in need” notes at “ there is tornado in my city”
Beyonce has many awards why
Album of the year. Country music album of the Year.❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wtf did I just watch??  Absolutely garbage.
Hate u

😂😂😂😂😂There is a big war 😂😂😂in the description reply below
Worst album, can’t believe this got chosen over billie, WILD
THIS won a Grammy? hahahah....you should hear the country band that plays down the street from me...
The bottom line is whoever gets nominated is still the one who will win because she's the queen she knows what her husband's got to say is Grammy people are scared shitless
😒🫥😒🫥😒🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮
Trash 🤮
La canción esta bien, el baile puagggg
A Hittt
It's that Beyoncé makes art I love that woman ❤
Crap
This is horrible
She's about as country as tit's on a bull
This isn't country. This is B.S.
no effort no budget for a music video but at least she has that talent that cost million dollars lol 😅
Shows how sold out the world really is
Not bad, it was ok a mediocre pop country song..far from real country music..I am sad that they allowed  this song to be chosen for a top award..Beyonce,  pretty voice but not worth winning a top country award, NO WAY Shouldn't have happened..first time ever listening to her..she is Beautiful but no reason to be showing everything you got..not classy at all..real women  don't have to show everything you got to show how Beautiful you are..give me Charlie Pride or Darius Rucker or Tony Jackson they can sing real country music..give me Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Lionel Ritchie
We can’t base country off what most fans were conditioned to believe the image and plot. Sounds like yt washing to me
Well?
Oh this song is bad!
She looks so stupid she thinks she can sing country what a joke
Because she’s known 😢
Porque no canta ago de su verdadera vida 😢 no cosas de Los estados de usa
Disgusting
I’m 34 - I look a lot younger because of my diet.
Cloud 23 sauce with almond butter and pad Thai and cashews. Side of spinach and sweet potatoes - mmm.
My diet. I also love pasta I just go vegetarian.
Cucumber, tomato, Brie on a bruschetta with balsamic as an appetizer and cauliflower pizza with a ton of wine.
I’m vegetarian
I can’t now but something to think about. Fernando’s ex and her mom = not welcome in my home.
I’m a good cook you’ll love my food.
I’m a good cook you’ll love my food.
When I have the means, I love making food for friends and fam.
As you can see, I eat a lot I just go vegetarian.
legallly reetarded
Blue looks just like Beyoncé
Fk this is country music?
this scks
yes
This song don’t deserve the grammy.
Complete garbage.  Jay z your a sell out for what you did....
wow.....disco country......wichooooo!!!! with all the boob action going on, and the black background, looked more like porn trailer!!!! the song's not too bad, but this ain't country. not by a long shot.......disco mix maybe🤣🤣
so this fucking song won best country song???🤢
I had to hear what all the fuss was about... this just isn't country - not that the Grammy's know anything about country.  I haven't watched them in year and will continue to live my life without them.
actually the music isnt so bad but she made it look so trashy!..does not look country at all
THIS LITERALLY IS SHIT 💩💩💩
i have have been hearing a lot about this song so i desided to search it song is good but one song dont make her a country singer she is a good singer but like all the other country singers she needs to pay her dues she hasent not yet
song ok but outfit is yuck
People are unbelievable just becaz she  dont have the yank in her tone means that it aint country. She is from Tennesse which is country as well. And if was sombody else who sang country like this y'all wouldn't be beating them down, its only because her husband is pdiddy thats why y'all so hateful caz when this was song was trending with the dance everybody loved it until pdiddy issues happened
Cheezy
Keep crying racists and uncle toms. Beyonce the talented and beautiful 😍🤣
Beyonce is the queen of country music.❤️❤️❤️❤️
I mean I don't like country and it's not horrible but this is the best album of the year lol
I guess tallent doesnt win anymore this song really chupa.
I do not remember country songs being explicit because of the language. I hate this.
This is straight garbage. How is country music. Miss older country music. Im not  saying she cant sing cuz she can. Its just not country.
This is garbage
This is fucking gross. This isn't country. It's DEI country
Heck, no she is not no country singer
Oh. I get it. Need to expose our boobie to win in grammys
She won for what? This is horrible.
Best Latin pop album: Beyonce Best R&B album: Beyonce lol bruh
This is trash
I think her books are falling out
I do not listen to country that much but this is not country.. The country is about the singer, not the instruments. Beyonce sings like a pop artist, even in this and her lyrics are dull because she can not sing country.. She did not put much effort in to adding the quirks that country singers are doing to make their songs sound like country. Beyonce won because she is famous and are in a good position with the once who decide who will win or not. It is dumb how famous artists just ride the wave once they get famous and get praised for mediocre stuff. Songs like these are a humiliation towards those who live and breathe country when they are robbed out of awards that should be theirs.
Its all just buzz words doesn't remotely sound like music she should quit while she's still ahead
What if we helped both the border problem and the drug problem with kindness.  Send the immigrants back across the border with the drugs they supposedly bring.  If mexico doesnt take the drug, thus helping the economy, tyen at least the immigrant returning hime with nothing can join the cartel.
This is gross😮

I ❤ beYonce
Love it
This is garbage
A shame for the country music.
Might a as well not wearing anything
Esto ganó álbum del año? Que descaro.
What a clown 🤡..0 to 10 she's a 2..👎
She bought that award. Chris Stapleton's song blows her out of the park.  He exemplifies country.  She walks out looking like a ghetto thug continually blowing smoke out her finger and her song sucks.  Shits emberrassing. Beyonce everyone knows you bought that.  Stick to ghetto rap singing with your soon to be jail buddy, Pshiddy.
Where video not country..they don't have to be naked to make a video
Diisgrace
AOTY Grammy . Country music album of the Year Grammy. The QUEEN of country music.❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is proof how corrupted are the Democrats, and Hollywood people. Trump fill hollywood with talented people again .
That's NOT country music.
🗑️
I’ve heard swamp donkeys and lot lizards 🦎 make better country music than this horrendous piece of shit!
What a pile of steaming💩! Shots fired! 🤣 The video for this and Ya Ya just shows how much effort she's putting into this country genre she's trying to monopolize.
I know that 🎼is subjective & I  ❤🎶of all genres (cuz a banger a banger) & 💗 a lot of Queen B jams but I ain’t feelin this one.  IMO she received the country award bc of who she is and who she married to. Not that it matters to anybody else BC I know literally nobody else gaf abt some random internet option. JS my rating is. 👎👎 & MAYBE a half.  🤷🏾‍♀️🫤
Straight bullshit
This is not good
This is complete trash not close to country we live in sad times good luck.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pure trash
Are we putting boobs in country now ? This is garbage....
This sounds like  "Redneck Woman "
This is not bad. She can sing.
No class
This ain't country.........
How many country videos have there been that show a third of boob
62 million views in 11 months?? How in the hell did this win a Grammy?
Wait a minute, this nonsense song won the Grammy 2025 ??? I am sure, Whoever voted for this song was high that day & have not heard 'Die With A Smile' ...
So you're telling me that this song deserved a grammy?????
How in the hell has this made any awards…. Absolutely horrible.
Vaginerna
This song sucks 🤣🤣🤣
Winning awards doesn’t make it better 😂🔊
What happening here 😂🖤
Who is here 2025 Feb
Worst video I’ve ever seen. Bizarre
Loved this song
This weak ass shit got a gramy? I guess when your husband is Jay-Z they'll do whatever you say.😂😂
So this is the new country? 😂
Low budget video
i don't think so this deserves a grammy 😭
Thats was very sorry.
WTF..I see Cyborg doing country.
What does the half-naked body have to do with anything?
Seriously this is the video????
Hey, it’s Franklin
I truly enjoyed the album and the philosophy behind it. I know every word because it's been on repeat since its release. I would love to see AMERIICAN REQUIEM used as a soundtrack in a film. I have a hot dance routine for Bodyguard. I loved being on an emotional roller coaster while listening to this masterpiece. Some of my favorite songs include Levi jeans, Protector, Riverdance, Yaya, Tyrant II Most Wanted, Bodyguard, Blackbird, 16 carriages, and Texas Hold 'Em, not to mention spaghetti. The engineer's sound and her excellent vocals just made everything come together seamlessly.
‏‪1:20‬‏ downnnnnn 🎉🎉🎉
This song is crap the worst song ever
This is a joke.
Ahhh yes. Best cuntry song of all time. Really popped off with this one 🥴
Most country women don't show their breasts hanging out etc.. A little more class than what you see here.
Stick with your own crap, a Real country singer should of won the award! I won't watch those awards ever again!!
This shit won a Grammy what a joke no wonder they canceled the cmt awards
I don’t think the song is horrible but Grammy no way I don’t have a problem with her trying something new never a Beyoncé fan but the song is catchy .
Auto tune can turn anyone into a country singer apparently 🤔.
This is just pop music mocking country
So this is the Grammy awards nominees and winners 🥷
Beyoncé,  Luke 16:15 New King James Version 15 And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.  Proverbs 14:12-16 KJV  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death. Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of that mirth is heaviness. The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: And a good man shall be satisfied from himself.
A mi si me gusto desde el. Primer dia que la escuche 🤠🤠🤠🤠
This is so sh!tty. Ho-down for sure. Terrible
This is soooooooo bad😂
Is this a joke?
This Is stupid
Nice try diddy
Why do these female artists  feel the need to get half naked that's not country
Terrible
This is what having a husband buying a Grammy win sounds like😂😂
What a joke!!
TRASH  NOT COUNTRY AT ALL
Stupid
This is absolutely beyond the definition of cliche dogshit
You not country you not in no dive bars you at Diddy party doing weird shit too children
And this ain't country... if anything it would blues
This literally is the last thing from country.
🤣🤣🤣
i'm trying to be open minded i really am but this song is so ass 😭
Sólo tenemos que ver las vistas de Beyoncé y comparar las de BILLIE para ver que FUÉ UN ROBO!!!!!
She sucks big time
No melody....nothing
Thick of it by ksi has more views than this shit.
This disease has infected country music.
Probably one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my whole life
So proud of you Beyonce. Winning country Grammy award. Love this song. Forget them haters. 🤠 Blacks created country music. Don't let nobody tell you that you can't do what you're ancestors created. You make me proud to be an cowboy. ✊🏿🤠 Love my sister queen 👑B
Bro I'm getting 30 minutes of adds why the f43k are you torturing people with adds
This song is the worst country song I've ever heard
Can't believe this didn't win best video of all time.
Doesn’t sound country at all
Not a fan of country music but thought I would check this out...conclusion I really don't like country music now
She needs to stay in her own lane!
sorry but how did all this win a grammy again?
EXCUSES ME?! YOU FUCKING TELL ME THAT SHE WON THE GRAMMY????  (Before anyone comes for me this is my opinion SO I better not see any comments saying "stop fucking hating on Beyonce!")    I'm so fucking done with this. This song is literally trash like yeah her voice fits this song but like all she's saying is  "tHIs aiNT tEXaS, aInT nO hOLd tHEm" and like the video is worse because all she's doing is just wearing a jacket were it covers her b00b$ and then she just shoots thin air and then it restarts..   Litterly her: 🚶‍♀️🏃‍♀️🚶‍♀️   😎👉    😎☝   Like it's fucking boring bc in my opinion if I watch a song vid I don't want to see the same thing over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER, like that gets boring to me. And ALSO is no one talking about the songs Billie made like I literally heard here songs EVERYWHERE.. EVER IN FUCKING WALMART PEOPLE WERE PLAYING BIRDS OF A FEATHER😡 I felt so bad for Billie bc when she started crying I started crying... Also is no one talking abt all the Beyonce drama.. Like it was all over my tiktok Abt that drama!!   I have NEVER EVER HEARD OF COWBOY CARTER UNTIL THE GRAMMY THING WAS CALLED.. And also I better not have people reply to me saying "yOUr jUsT mAd bC beYoNcE iS bETteR thEn yOu wILl eVer bE?! " like no bitch because every one is mad not just me👺
She got that Grammy  ..shit stay positive... Too much negative energy as it is... Give this woman her glory... To me, country music is a story of one's life filled with instruments and soul..  shit it's beautiful... .
I love a lot of Beyoncé's music, but this just isn't country nor is it worthy of any kind of award.
Am i really to believe this Woo-Hoo garbage beat Chris Stapleton for this years best country artist??? I see why true to thier music artists stopped attending the grammys 😭😤
trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️

JayZ must have paid a lot for that Grammy!
TODO ES CULPA TUYA
NI TU HIJA TE ESCUCHA PELOTUDA
SOS UNA RIDICULAAAAAAAAA
The fact that this even got an award ticks me off, vocals mid, lyrics mid, instrumental mid asf.
This isn’t a country song.
This shit is trash . She should’ve never got the grammy
I'm here after grammy win
BEST COUNTRY ALBUM MY ASS

Put some clothes on and go back to hip hop or whatever. Throwing in a few  "country" words does not make this country.

We all have point and opinion, she's making money, videos and Grammy, she doin it regardless of comments and opinion, comments keeps the $$$ flowing hahahaha 😆 😂 🤣 😉 😜 😊
Que alguien me diga que tiene de especial esta cancion porque enserio no suena y tiene mas bot el video 62 millones de bot
No matter how naked she gets that's not country

This is absolutely garbage
This song is trash
How to win grammy without any  effort😅😅
This rubbish
Garbage. Not even country.
Why people gotta curse in music. ? Im not opposed to cursing but in a proper country music song it ain’t necessary. Next Niki M  is gonna being doing porn country. This is the down fall of country music.
The song is too fine and good but Bille really deserves grammy not beyonce this time
this is garbage
Not country! Worthless, boring, and reaching for something it ain't!
Someone made a mistake with the upload, this one was a up for the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.
OMG! Lol
Now THIS is proper country music. Chris Stapleton ain't got shit on Beyonce.
What is this trash
This isnt country. This is absolute crap.
Who is watching and hearing this song for the first time ever.   😂😂
Yea who even knew about this
How is this Country? How did this song win a grammy?? Honestly 😂😂😂 no wonder she was "shocked" to win 😂
Petite voleuse beyonce vole les grammy

This sucks Beyoncé Christ stapleton should a have won that Grammy reward also Billie should have won too you suck at music that’s why Michal Jackson was better than you 😂😂
This song was meh 😮‍💨

❤❤❤❤
Horrible

Lainey Wilson should have won the best country album
Billie deserved it
This isn't that good. 0 creativity.  What a joke
Dog shit song
Astagfirullah
This song rape my ear
What the!!
She sucks
Thank you Beyonce for a fantastic song (sarcasm)
I was at a Conway Twitty concert and Tammy Wienets husband came in an sat down for the show.  She signed my Conway Twitty ticket with I'll do my crying in the rain.  Never seen that ticket since.  Hold on the memories
At 1:45 how come I can hear the lyrics being edited from Sugar to liquor? Listen closely. I know Beyonce says both during the song.
Trash Go somewhere  Lord help us
Trash😂
Billie eilish is better
Did she thank Beyonce?😂
This video is extremely disrespectful to the country genre and artists. I truly believe that she shouldn't have won that genre. Not even the Country awards recognized her to their genre. To add on to this, people are such hypocrites because everyone wanted to crucify Taylor Swift when she changed genres and won best Album against Beyonce, but when Beyonce does it..."She's amazing". Beyonce is extremely overrated and it truly seems that everything now a days is rigged. Its truly a shame that peoples true hard work and talent is being outweighed by an overrated celebrity.
❤❤
❤ I love this song
💩💩💩💩💩
The new comments are full of haters 😂😂😂
Her songs suck
This is terrible
Bro she's doing the same thing over and over again😭
Une belle 💩
This ain’t country
This has enough appeal as a school bus fire
Wow, that's horrible.. no wonder why JZ had to spend hundreds of millions to get that award
Disgusting!
She forgot to get dressed.  But I wouldn't have gotten dressed for this sorry excuse of a song, either.
This is horrible song and even more horrible video.
This isn't country and the way she's dressed is an insult to country music fans. What a joke.
She is a joke. A naked flop 😵‍💫
Trashy
😂😂 Um no
What a crap song
G A R B A G E ! !
Country music 1st DEI award....only cost them almost a B to buy that award taken away...cheats
Y por esta grandiosa canción ganó un grammy 😮

This makes me glad I no longer listen to secular music.  This is an insult to the country music industry.  🤮
Songs good, video is hideous.

Horrible woke music byebye...... Trump is in office now busy getting males out of female sports and ending wars and wokeness and I lovit
Sexualizing your ridiculous fake country song. One eye Illuminati symbol. We get it you're scum Beyonce. You know you didn't win that Grammy it was brought. Your music is an insult to Country Music fans and musicians.
Queeennn
Billie still better then this crap
Wow what A tetttt… sorry song 🙂‍↔️uuuhu yuppie 😂😂😂😢
Ai comments are crazy work
Who else thinks Queen B looking mighty thick now days? Push away from the table B.
DEI Country Álbum of the Year.  What crap is this?  Ugh
Billie should have won. This is complete trash, rigged asf and you sold yo soul to the devil sis mhm
The amount of likes on this is whats killing me.
Hey shaboozey, my friend, if my back and neck are constantly cracking and feel like bone on bone, but they dont hurt and i am stronger than i have ever been, should i snap crackle pop or see a doctor?  Doctors (not blaming) alwasys result in me being sick and needing to be on medicine.  And i dont have a job and dont have medical insurance or a current address.  I think i am going to hang from trees and be tik tok famous for having the coolest filters and songs.  I took yours for the project.
THIS IS TRASH
This is NOT country. And Beyoncé, why are you trying to look European? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This isn’t country. Freaking DEI. She should be ashamed. I hope she is.
tf why she win grammy
All these you g girls look up to her so you’d think she’d have some class and put some damn clothes on .. she didn’t deserve it.  Much better songs and entertainers than her .  Shaboozey much better !
This album really isn’t country just cause there’s acoustic guitar riffs, chords and some “g’s” cut off on words and all the country genre buzzwords/phrases. It’s soul with country influence. Just like Joanne bye Gaga isn’t country, it’s still pop but with country influences. This is honestly the worst song it’s forcing us to think it’s country.   I think Beyoncé is no longer relevant. She’s been trying so hard since 4 to recapture her sound.
Tf ... you see that liberal poor me country singer that has that terrible song this is my church
Ha this video is a joke
The world is changing upside down Beyonce singing Country songs and Taylor swift singing pop synth songs
Try Dress like that infront of kids in my small town!
Tits out shit song, great example for women😂
Dude IDGAF if yall come at me but bullie ellish should have won thay grammy. 😒
I had to come check on this song that won a Grammy, this song is absolutely terrible 30 seconds in paused it and thought about kms
Trash
Keep crying. Bey rules!
By the way, beautiful voice, beautiful person, but you are not country
Beatiful,talented, but you ain’t country
For sure DEI 😂😂😂 …
Your song is trash Billie eilish is better Billie eilish should have won the Grammy
Way to slut it up
She should be ashamed of herself. She is a disgrace
The price for fame.....
This ain't country what so ever. You either paid to win or its because 12 yesr olds liked your tits.
This is NOT country!
Video trash
Forget the haters, this is d best country song ever and i will be damned if i dont play it on repeat 🎉
Aint no way this shit won over hit me hard and soft
Omgg how Did she win the Grammy !!
Cow patties all over the faces of real country artists
Dumbest video I've ever seen. WTF is she wearing on her face? Song is average. Nothing special.
perhaps the only good song on this album
Is this the song that made Billie  lose?😂😂
Sorry this isn’t country🤣
Do everyone a favor and stop trying to sing country
This sucks
A lot of effort must have went into this terrible video.   Nice illuminati eye there Beyonce.    Guess you'll regret selling your soul to the devil when you rotting in hell with him.  "Not all that glitters is gold.  What profits a man if he gains the world?.......but loses his soul......" -Jesus Christ🙏
She won for this! It's terrible
this stinks, figures the idiots like it.
aun no encuentro la musica que le hizo ganar al mejor album del año no lo encuentro porque esta no la es
OK, I had never heard this before. Then she wins a Grammy for best country album. I decided to listen to it before I would make any judgments. The fact is it sucks, she is an abomination. True country artist who have passed or rolling over in their graves, and the current country artist not to speak out against her
This song sucks and doesn’t deserve the song of the year!!!!
If this is country im Wyatt Earp.
The only song il for cowboy Carter is freakin Texas hold em
Was this outfit necessary?
Ye haw I love you queen
i'm still waiting for this supposed "country album"
I come here after knowing she gots Grammy award for this album ❤
I don't listen to much country music if at all. This is why WHAT ARE THEY THINKING 😂😂
This ain’t Texas? More like this ain’t country so how tf did she win? Oh wait it’s rigged.
That’s crap that’s not country how did that win anything 🤮
Is this a joke
I don't listen to country music on the radio because of this utter bullshit I think I just lost some brain cells and hearing after listening to 30 seconds of this I cannot even bear it anymore I had to pause the damn video just so I could type this now I'm going to go back to my bluegrass and real country
Me
Gotta say, it's a dang sight better than most of what passes for country these days.
Holy hell this is worst thing since her last album🤮🤮🤮🤮
i don’t like it
This is crap, like all of her stuff 😂
Naked and cussing this is definitely not country. What a disgrace.
No shirt, no pants, no service.
There were other country artists who were more deserving of an award.
I love this song and so happy she won a Grammy. But, the video isn’t great. Regardless, I love Beyoncé.
This song won her a Grammy. What a freaking joke.
This is not country
This is hot garbage. Shows how the music industry is shit. Spent 30 secs and put it on repeat, and it's Grammy worthy. Get the hell out of here.
MAMMIE BARRY you tube channel/5#@$MUMMY TOMBSTONE45😮BUY outy c45😢❤🍓🤓⚰️🤡💰📜🙃⚽️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️⚰️🧤🍓😅😮😢🎉😂❤3

Stupid video. 🤣🤣
Her outfit don’t go with country music
How did this wont against Chris?   Ahh..yes...
This is a piss poor excuse for country wtf happened to the genre for this to win the grammy she's basically stills doing the same music just in a lower tone n to a slightly different style beat it's sad
Listen guys there are real country singers who shoulda won not her. But don’t go lying saying this shit ISNT a bop lmao it’s a good song has a good vibe and IS a country song in reality, and honestly? This is one of her best songs… unlike her old music really
She just has a terrible husband that’s all.
Hello, it’s different and I don’t care for Beyoncé at all as a person but the song is not terrible. Award-winning? No, but it’s not bad. Still don’t like her though.
Garbage
Garbage
Horrible song
WORSE THAN AN ADOLESCENT''S CONFIDENCE IN THEIR TIKTOK POST ABOUT NOTHING!!! NO ONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS MUCH OF BEYONCE ON FREAKING REPEAT!!!!!! GTFOOH
What the nonsense lolol this song win Grammy award lol ...Billie ellish "hit me hard and soft " album is most better than her .... Billi ellish is winner in our eyes
This is trash
I'm going to your concert tonight
This song is so bad😭
Ya la gente se está dando cuenta que esta mina compra todo 😂 patetica😂
Esto ??? Jajajaja enserio 😂😂😂😂😂
This was just another album for Beyonce. Another win. No biggie. This was EVERYTHING to Billie. Her album was her HEART and she was robbed.
Song might be alright but without all the pounding!
DEI BS
You must be kidding me, how low can we go. Winning awards for this what the heck is going on.
Beyoncé you’re really the queen of pop,rap,country,R&B/soul you can do it all
Bad video honestly
This songs sounds good
There were better songs nominated🤨.
Just disgusting, how she could win grammy i do not understand, Whatever, Billie deserved grammy ......
This is supposed to be country? Lmao
So this is the song that’s view is very less behind than Bird of a feather? 😅
Beyonce Cowboy Carter album of the year!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ Deal with it!!!!
Beyonce is the queen of country music!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wtf???
Put some clothes on  and you don't sound like a country singer..you sound like wanta be she has to much companion her her own genre
Boring music.
Cry more you haters... 😂😂😂
This song is so bad I had to come back after her win and really listen to it . Wow .....dei for the win. Beyonce should do a rock album next im sure it will be number one, then heavy metal, punk etc we can make her number one of all time lolol smh #bought&paid
Revisiting this after a year I have more appreciation for "Texas Hold Em."  Such a beautiful song and I can hear all the genres under Beyonce's belt come out and blend so nicely together.
Depois vêm alguém dizer que esse álbum não mereceu🙄🙄🥱
Dont know how this album won i can say tyler childers did alot better and his music is more heart felt.
This sucks.
❤
Wth😅
WHAT THE DEVIL i dont understand how she won OMG 😕
Wear some clothes ! Little ones who love the country music  don't need to be seeing you half naked and swearing . Go back to the streets.
This isn't good.
Guess when you got money and fame you can call a poopy diaper a diamond and people will believe you. 😂 Nope, this ain’t country music.
Bro this is shit
Might as well just b naked🤷🏻
What a waste do what you do well obviously not county free Grammy with a black card go oj
Really do what you do well which obviously is not county go oj black card
Naaaa this is not no country
Ni quien tope este album flopero 🤷🏽‍♂️😒
Country stars don't have porn videos or dress like a porn star
THIS won a Grammy? Awful.
This is horrible. A disgrace to country music. Stay in your lane lady n put your titties away.   🤮
Gotta be the very worst song I’ve ever heard, right behind WAP.
This song doesn't deserve grammy nor the album
tremendo robo
This video background is copied from Adele send my love.. but then again she copies everything.. her horse stint in renaissance is copied from Amerie and crazy in love was copied from Amerie..yes we now know.. worse part was beyonce team completely made sure Amerie to be blacklisted for no reason.. then they complain there is not enough African American women in the music industry
The only thing even half country about this song is the title
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
At least the auto tuner worked
Beyoncé has ALWAYS been country. Y’all were just whitewashed into believing she wasn’t.
Terrible music
What a terrible example to children who follow country music.
If beyonce was a white girl,dayum!!!
Catchy tune, but is this the best they could do for a video?!!!!!😮
You did not deserve the grammy
Uhhh….this isn’t doing anything for me!!
Yes, im here for it.
Only 61 million views and she won unbelievable Oliver Anthony has 190, million
She's not a country by far she's a w**** making country bad
This is awful 😂
Stupid shit!😅
I love this music
Monday before the Grammys cowboy Carter album  averaged 1 million daily streams.
Monday after the Grammys cowboy Carter averages 7 1/2 million streams. The people are speaking.
Not country music. Sorry..
I am watching this was an open mind and I will judge it clearly. I will let you know how it goes after I watch it.. Okay, I tried and I'm not even a real country music fan, but this song is definitely an insult to anyone who is ever won any country music award and especially for any woman who is ever won any country music award. This is an insult
Awesome.
What a shitty song
NOT Country WHATSOEVA! SUCKS
it’s a country song but it has nothing to do with the video🤦🏻‍♂️
I see someone put as much effort into the meaningless "country" song as she did the music video. 👎
The most boring video ever
Ts so ass
I see 2 reasons why this won. and more why it shouldn't have.
Ghhheeeeeey!
This isn't even country. This is an insult to country
You better give that Grammy to Billie, Taylor, Sabrina, Charli, and everyone else who was nominated for the reward
this shit sucks
This mediocre and not country music/
Grammy’s are straight rigged, this is hot dog water  🤮🤮🤮🤮
If  anyone believes she should have won a Grammy for this shit is hilarious ! Hollywood so fake !
Who else came back after the album won AOTY?
We all agree that this isn't better than birds of a feather !
Where's  Franklin 😂
What the hell is this music video!! Shie is touching her stomach on looop WTFFFFF  And thats the most viwed video on album of the year 😔
🤢
So sad for country music. Turning into Porn.
Why cant we get a normal music video without someone getting naked
Prácticamente solo está cantando y hace los mismos pasos y está casi desnuda what
horrible tune
Downvoted
An absolute waste of time
Aren't up to the hype that the undeserving ones love
Wish my boob's looked like that lol
It is a really great album, dont care with the simp haters who only know mainstream electronic music.
This is embarrassing and absolute garbage
Wow, what a hot load of 🗑
Bad song
That's legal to wear why do people wear that it's literally disgusting it almost shows her tings but the song is amazing it would be nice if she wasn't in it though😅
This is b.s she won a Grammy lmao
Grammy = Sold to the record label willing to pay the most.
It's obvious why she won the grammy. The video is a tribute to the illuminati. Absolute trash in my opinion. Never liked her. She and her husband are clowns.
Garbage song
😊😊😊
This aint country.🤮
اغنية خرا مغنية اخرا زق زق زق وععععععععععععع وععع
No way this won the grammys 😢
Can't say anything bad about it or libs will call us racist...🤪
This song won a Grammy for country? 😂 I never heard this song. Won’t hear it again. 🤦‍♂️
That don't sound like country. And she should be  ashamed  the way she's dressed
I’m not saying this isn’t country but when you pick this extremely cliche pop country over people like Zach top I can’t trust your award show
Muszak to my ears. I don' t Like Beyoncé! Absolutely overtated. I can't understand the Hype!!!!
I don’t understand how this album got album of the year when Billie put her heart into all the videos and everything and this girl took a 12 second loop and with the same loop music in the back with different vocals…
Country music is lost. DAC. HANK 3. ALABAMA. That's true country music.
This is garbage. This aint Country music
The grammys  it was for biilie,sabrina or taylor😢😡
Country music has no place for ghetto.  Hard pass on this trash.
Como que canción del año😭
Wow this won the Grammy? Horrible. And so disrespectful to those other country artists
Billie robbed.
Not the worst song. But nothing special.
It turns out DEI is also good for elevating billionaire grifters who benefit from propping up a narrative that the West oppresses black people and that all black people are victims and can't be held accountable for their actions.
It's questionable whether this is even music, let alone country music.
Song of the yearr!!
Stupid song
Sounds generic and bland , the Grammy show is fake
Yas Bey
This is dog shit
I'm not a country fan at all.  And this is not country at all
This is not country and is terrible.  Her barotone voice.  Geezus.

This is album won? Why? WTF
That aint country. Its a half nekkid black woman trying to be white and sing rap.
This is awful.
The whistling sounds like the Doug cartoon 😂
She is washed up in hip hop so she jumps to country! Country don't want a grifting Freak Off freak. This sing is awful. Wake up
This is awful🤢💩
Tbh this is bullshit
Tbh this isnt bad but no way its better than birds of the feather

Maybe you should sing about more important topics like Marvin and Aretha.
Why don’t I feel you, pretty girl?  I never have.
This is bs Billie should have won
Country music takes a big time L
Wanna be white
Istg nobody in asia hearing this shzz until they found out this shzz won an album of the year lol.
Selling sex is all you do .. ruining our young daughters! Tiered of this bullshit! It’s time we call a spade a spade! Let’s not ruin the last American culture with your sexual filth! Period. No tampons!
It’s ok, but I have heard better songs. Does she ever wear clothes or does JayZ prefer her naked!

Almighty queen Illuminati beyond 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

This is the only song I've heard off the album , this doesn't sound country
Nope.
Most boring video ever, and need I say she's about as country as a badly put on play by city kids.

It sucks big time!!
This an’t county
One min in and I’m done
I thought 💭 MAYBE this would be uhhh good.   It is really bad…  but I guess she thinks she’s hot with this Illuminati 1 eye open chest nonsense.  Seriously this is crap.  Not too familiar with her other crap… but it’s gotta be less crappy, you’d think?  but what I hear she and hubby are in the sicko diddy category so maybe they’ll get imprisoned soon.  And the judge will throw the key away,  for this attempt at “country” alone she should be locked up.
9.95% viewer thumbs up, lmao
What a joke
Is this a joke. 😅😅😅😅😅
How is this country lmao

Her voice is talented  and song is so nice however video is boring .

Country music lovers are wondering how she won? Probably cause grammy’s are set up like fake wrestling matches. Beyonce is overrated
Stupezzzz dis song make no sense
Trash song by a trash musician
Judge only looks at her tites  to when she a good singer but not country music
Gay
Rigged
She’s right this ain’t Texas anything.. More like 🐂💩 I’ve never seen a cowgirl dressed like a Cyborg 🤣
Listened and still dont think its that good. Sounds more like a pop song than country.
Ong thus traH
This is absolutely horrible.
not country Grammy worthy decent song but not country just cause u say Texas don't mean its country
Wtf it sound like STANDARD country song from CARS??
Bull shit, it was given to her. She didn’t earn it. Terrible song and she can’t sing.  If you have to buy it it’s not worth winning.
Congrats, B, absolutely loved the  country album !❤
Trash
That ain’t country music
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY! GEORGE, REBA, DOLLY, BROOKS AND DUNN

Lmao and this years winner of hip hop album of the year goes to Garth brooks lol
This is an insult to the real hard working country singers out there. Wow. There is no “country” in this song at all. It’s awful!
I came after she won the Grammy. 👸🏻🔥
Hope she goes down down and get punishmed for  her evil doings.
She wants to be White...she is a DISGRACE to the BlackRace.  Look at her Bleached Hair.
Put a shirt on women
😂😂😂😂
Are u serious
This is trash... Straight garbage.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..... she's country now?
Phoned in 💩
Says its a ho down. Shows up in the video dressed like one. 👀🤦🤣

This won insted of billie? Seriously .
I just came here to thumbs down it. Bring back thumbs down number YouTube.
COMPLETE AND UTTER SHIT!
Y pensar que está cosa ganó el Grammy 😞✋
this is SHIT.
Beyonce aint NEVER BEEN TO A DIVE BAR.  Her lyrics are such b.s She has over 15 writers on each song. Smh
I don't believe country fans will ever forget this robbery the grammy's committed. There are far much artist that outperformed this "country song".
It’s literally a YouTube shorts on constant repeat.    Great video.    Really.
Girl I still think Billie should have won the Grammy 😂
this is the worst country song ive heard in my entire life's existence and that's saying a LOT
Terrible song
Crap
So what's the fuss on not acountry fan really although some l never really liked the old twangy stuff or the new she thinks my tractors sexy stuff but let's go back ok Charlie Pride he had a real country style but when Dean Martin started doing it that opened up the door for some country singers to take that approach then Ray Charles he lent his twist and that was an influence what about Freddy Fender and the TexMexs stuff oh sorry for being politically incorrect even if it did sound great  recently Tennessee whiskey with an Etta James beat love that Elvis he mixed it all up so what's the fuss with her   l don't get it
Wow its like she woke up hungover and was like okay lets get this over with 😂
Ringing that look to country music. Country music is going away folks.
This is not a country song lol what disrespect to country music.
Welcome back home. You can take a girl from Texas, but you can never get Texas from the girl. 👏👏👏👏
Oh my gawd your who made this song beoncay made this song no wonder why I hate her I hated this song it’s like the worst song on the radio
I miss the old Beyonce.....
Crap video
This song sucks. How can that happen? 😂
This is not country music
yes beyonce we get it, u have your yonkers out
trash
Blonde Hair, light skin, country music.... Straight up cultural appropriations.
DEI grammy award goes to Beyonce😂
HIT ME HARD AND SOFT  💙💙💙
How did this piece of crap win album of the year and country album of the year?
This is the dumbest thing I ever saw… and her winning country album of the year is absolute proof that the entertainment industry is awoke worthless waist of time! No wonder Alan Jackson walked out on them years ago.  George Jones just rolled over in his grave!
El mejor álbum es de Billie Eilish y todos lo saben 💙💙💙💙
I’m tired of them no doing video shoots
She won a Grammy for this crap? This definitely isn’t country music.
Worst album
Trash
I would rather listen to pigs grunting and phocking than this garbage
This is ass
This is terrible!  Not deserving of a Grammy!
This is the most boring video I’ve ever watched in my life
Beyonce does country? Alright I'll give it a listen... This can't be the song that won her a Grammy. Garbage and not country.
country can’t be serious 😂
2 words\\Just Disgusting …
She won with this!!!?????? 😮😮😮U
Different kinda hoe down
This is Franklins original intro copycat
This is the stupidest song I've ever heard and it won a Grammy wtf
Por esto ganó el grammy?...verdad?
Stupid song, foolish video.
If you know country, then y’all will know that this is not country music. Don’t get me wrong. I love this song, but it’s my country.
This song sucks 😂😂😂
This is not country music.
She’s almost naked!  Not a fan at all!  This is not country music
Wierd Al Yankovic, what a mockery of an iconic culture and way of life.
This AIN'T country. Idk what it is but I am ashamed she won a Grammy for this CRAP.
Billie got more views than this for birds of a feather so how did she not get a single grammy?! It only takes like what 2 people to write billie’s songs while it takes 50 writers for beyonce?! I’m not a taylor swift fan but what about her too?!
This song won grammy? I want my time and view back. Such a slap to country music.
Doesn't sound anything country to me. Her voice doesn't cut it at all. Sounds the same in anytbing she sings.
Not grammy worthy
Music video best served while it's muted
Ew couldn't even get through the whole song. It sounds like someone just typed "Beyonce" and "country" into an AI music generator. No creativity or soul in this song
Boooring
🗑️ 🤠🔫
Garbage
Dei winning Grammy 😂 So horrible!
This stuff won country album of the year? That’s laughable the Grammys are dead
Just disliked it and ppl should do it too
What is this crap? 😨
I looked up this song cuz I can’t figure out why people are saying she did nit make a country song when this song exists!
❤❤❤❤❤💞🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💞
Billie derived the grammy
This song sucks donkey nuts
Leave famous country songs alone.Stay in your own lane. You are NOT country.
This song sucks!
Thank you
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
😂 had to search this up cause I have not heard this at all
yeah u don’t deserve any grammys
Horrible!!!!!!!
Just wanna say i just realized commenting here is gonna fml over for the next month!!
This is not country
Only reason she one bc she's half naked in the videos more then likely
Horrible! And a Grammy?! Sacrilegious! You, Bey, are NOT a CW singer!
Oh I have heard this song before I didn't actually think it was country because I'm like "this sounds like Beyonce must be a cover, or she's featured on the song" 😂
Listening to a cow take a dump sounds better than this, it's a lot more Country as well.
If this is her most popular song then what is the rest 😂
Trash
This song is straight trash 🗑😪😕
Disgusting, put on some clothes and that isn't country
Not country!
I think I have quite good taste in music ...This one doesn't deserve grammy ...Billie's does. Beyonce bought this grammy award too.
اوم الطفش
I can’t wait until she’s so old the newer better artists get the recognition that they deserve…
Out of all the country songs that came out in 2024 ..how did this win … it’s hardly country..
lol
Yes Beyonce you won you are already a winner❤
Great song, disgusting video. You are a great addition to country, but not the way you presenting the song. Put some clothes on that is country!
Whore trash ass country song
Flop the year🎉
Esto fue un robo
Definitely not worth winning a Grammy for
This go hard on mute🔇🔇🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️

Best album? ????The Grammys like football are fixed!
We here after she won the grammy
How did she win this is really terrible
non country garbage
Wow in a bad way
This song got a lots of views because of fake Grammy fixed award. I don't find any of her songs in her album amazing or worth listening. And only got 600k likes out of 61m views. This is insane.
Pero esta casi desnuda
U ARE DEFINITELY NOT BETTER THAN CHRIS STAPLETON.  GET OUT OF HERE. THIS SHIT AINT COUNTRY.
Esta canción solo lo escucha beyonce, no merecías el grammy bby
Kanye did it first - Poopy-di scoop Scoop-de-di-whoop

Now I want a glass of milk.
Disappointed this video didn't have more than Bey's implants.  Love to see her dancing.
Is this the song that won a Grammy🥴?!
613 k likes Billy got 2.4M still no gramy
Sorry but this ain't no country music it's junk asf
I come after Grammy 😂
This song makes no sense, no braw. She just ruined country music.
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
This is disgusting. Her video is vile. Her voice is awful combined with country style. It sounds like a joke and she actually won? What an absolute disgrace and an insult to real country artists. And on top of all that she is walking around with a stupid blonde wig.
She didnt deserve THE GRAMMY! Who even listens to this album?! Like come on! The fake surprise when they said her name in the grammys UPSET ME and seeing billie eilish crying made most of all of the fans sad! Over all HMHAS had the most listeners and her vocals are great i dont say i hate her but this album deserved for 2024 grammys bot 2025!
This song won a Grammy? Questioning who did choose it to be the first? So weak song .... not enough for a Grammy.
I asked my daughter to pick her favourite & she’s not into this sort of music, but she picked Nikki.  I agree💯
this is not album of the year 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Omg… this is terrible
High Priestest of Satanism
Stupid
And she win  Grammy for country music??? Total fraud
DEI woke grammy fake award goes to beyonce country song lol 😂
this won a grammy?? well its givin DEI vibes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This robbed our Billie a Grammy 😢.
Hank wiliams sang it better
Commercial crap    Johnny Cash is real
i never know this song bf if this is dont win grammy
¿Si se acuerdan que Beyoncé era negra? 🤔
Cancelled
Bullshit song... . really sorry. Mainstream only to be dumb overtime. 😂
Honestly asking, why did this win a grammy? Like...okay yea it's great but there are better ones right? Or is there something really special bout this which I could not figure out...?
First thing I noticed: Her stockings are on backwards.
This was so rigged I can think of at least 10 other albums way better than this hunk of crap
I do not care if I get a hit on me beoncèy sucks now and this is not a good album
💩💩💩💩
Ewwww
We all scared of Beyonce 😭
Guess you can can elevate yourself to be too good for a few minutes of choreography??
This over wildflower is CRAZY
Wow ..... She really got Grammy for this song???..... Over Billie's and Bruno's and many more great songs??
Country music is negro music highjacked by immigrants
The lyrics on this album are ridiculously bad, lol. I bet she had people write these songs for her and she just smacked her name on them.😂
You know when you have no talent when you have to appeal to an audience based on sexuality.
This is trash
This shit is so ass. How does someone who made this trash song beat any country singer this is just dissapointing
Bille fans crying in the comments
This song is the worst song I've ever heard
She has a nice voice, but this isn't actual country music. It just takes that crap they play on commercial FM another step in the wrong direction.
jelek
Who does she think she is? Sad how country music has gone down hill. This ain't country. Country women don't dress slutty.
I wish famous people had class.
Well people were making videos w this track so justifiable why she won.
Come on haters, y'all can do better than that!! Beyonce is the queen of country music!!❤️❤️
Straight booty cheek ass song 😑
Song is pos! 🤣🤣🤣
That is the most irritating song ever. It sounds worse than her fake nails on a chalkboard.
How does anybody view this as country music
Not country stick to rap
Hmmm… 👌
Cowgirls don't bear their breasts
I am a65 yrs old white male ,you go girl great talent ,sounds country to me ,y'all need to stop hating on this young lady
Country??? Hahahahahahahahahah  Only your influence could make this posible. This is not country
Her body still looks amazing !!!!.
Never heard it on the radio. Glad I didn’t.
Zach Bryan and/or Morgan wallen deserved that award…… !!!!!! Not her.
This is the stupidest video i have ever seen
What? These haters saying this is terrible?
I thought we did away with DEI? Well, that tears it people! The last stronghold of common sense has fallen to the liberal agenda.  Country music belongs to the satanic cabal now.  All that’s left to do is, sit back and wait for country musics subject matter to change from, missing my girl, drinking my beer, driving country roads, fishing on ponds to, hitting up the liquor store, slapping my bitch, selling some drugs, representing my street and going to prison. 😂lol 👍
This was the best song on the album? See why it's grammy material. ....
Came here to listen to this song for the first time along with a couple of on the album. What is this crap? Budget didn’t even allow for clothes. What’s with these celebs wresting no clothes?? Cowgirls wear clothes mate. Unless you’re a cow boy???
BOOBIES
Garbage 🗑!
Lol no way not #1
This is awful... and what's with the nakedness
California Country. Always have to be strange 😂😂
Looks like that Jay-z buys the grammy, this is not a good country song and got overhyped by media. I have doubts about the grammy, looks like that the judge was Beyoncé fans than judges.
this is not a country song not even close
this is not a country song not even close
I love country music and this song sucks!  Maybe Beyoncé won the Grammy in place of being paid to sing at Harris campaign?  Why else would she win???
Worst video EVER. Someone's gotta say it out loud. Music- good. Lyrics- 🤔
Pedifiles need fans too. 👍
Anyone else paying too much attention 😅
This is pretty much the worst song ever
If trash cans could sing
Disgrace to country music
She is no country singer. Terrible song
She knew about Diddy!
Awful
How’d they get those hangers to stay up like that? Looking forward to the making of 👍
Garbage
Dolly Parton has 11 Grammy Awards, Frank Sinatra has 11 Lady Gaga has 3 While Beyoncé  has 35 Grammy Awards 🤣🤣🤣
How in the hell did this crappie song win a Grammy??
This looks very AI, just saying.
Straight trash
Country? Slutty county? Piggish slutty country? This woke culture makes me effing SICK!!!!!!!
Beyoncé oh my God🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤😊😊
What a disgusting person
Wow. I thought regular country music was bad. Someone considers this country music? This is clearly soul/R&B trying to sound like country music and failing miserably. Beyonce can sing, but this is just bad. No bad isn't nearly strong enough, this is utterly horrible. What a waste of her talent.
Ну фігня ж люди
yuk. boobies to make someone watch.
This album is not it..Billie should have won honestly what a joke🤦‍♂️
😢sad
Wtf is this shit?! My ass makes better music after a Taco Bell night
T&A due to lack of talent.
Sucks
Well I guess I didn't like country much anyways. Enjoy ruining genre of music.
Not better than Billy😂
It’s so obvious the Grammys are fixed after hearing this
No sonaste ni en tu casa querida
Why not just strip and sing? You're almost there, girl.
I'd rather listen to cats have sex Patsy cline is rolling in her grave
Nobody asked for this
Historic Win!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ not too many can switch genres and nail it their FIRST time ❤🎉 support comes in both negative and positive forms but either way it’s still support which means more money, so let them be mad and continue to watch you shine✨ TexasMade 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
This is country? 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️
Better than most Country crap put out now except for Chris Stapleton.
Undignified.
Am i the only one who thinks this actually sucks butt and that she should really stick to what shes been good at for the past years.
Ummmm, I listen to country music strictly every single day of the week, and have never heard this song or any song by her on any country station in the entire last year!!!  That being said, Best Country Album of The Year!?!?!?!   Somethings up, if this garbage got any kind of award........!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Here comes Franklin the Turtle Remix
How tf does this win over Billie’s album
Wow! Got a lot of people who don't like this! Guess what?! I'm one of them!! Best way to listen to this is to turn it up REAL LOUD then push the MUTE BUTTON !!
Roseanne will get the next rapper of the year
Nothing but trash.  Nothing country about this. An embarrassment.
So confusing as to HOW this won. It's kinda ok, but not very impressive.
No talent eye candy
She has no place in country at all
Why was this song nominated as the best country song of the year
How does it feel Beyonce to have to buy your way to a grammy? This song is shit and your outfit is ridiculous.
Fake AF
Garbage
No way the best album.  FIXED!
Why are there suddenly so many n*zi's in the comments?  Yes this is country music, Beyoncé is texan unlike most of the frauds in the country music industry and black people SIGNIFICANTLY helped to create and craft the genre but were erased in history.
🚮
How in the hell is this country music
Its not Wright selling porn and preacing god its not okay i was broughte up by hippys but this stinks
Is there humans in this comment section?  Sounds strangely digital.   The video itself is surely lacking 😢
And this crap is 'album of the year'? Ludicrous. The US truly is in the shitter.
Ain’t no way this heaping dumpster fire won the best country song. What a soulless song.
This song is terrible
This has to be ai generated lyrics .
Well this is stupid.
Junk
Really???????
what kind of shit music is this
At first I thought it was 'Prodigal Son' by the Rolling Stones.  🤷
Ok I like this song
great track aged so well. and album too. haters please come on me, im enjoying myself in dem comments
DISGUSTING - THIS IS NOT COUNTRY
Why is she naked?  Country isn’t naked! It’s about the music not the titiies!
Disgusting.  🤢
Love Beyonce, LOVE the song, HATE this video UGH 3:57 seconds of this was mind numbing. You wanna do a video, then DO a video! Mr Producer, you want to display her talent? THEN DISPLAY IT! You do NOT "MAIL IN" her talent!
Most boring video 😒
I’m a Texan, and this ain’t even country music, this is some ugly shiyte
🔥
All y'all broke muthafuccas mad get some money
Billie Eilish made a better album.
Trash video. She’s no where near country.
why does it have to be overly sexual? everything is ass and titties....this is barely country and this song is the most country song in her album lmao
Sounds like she wrote country lyrics and decided to imitate bruno mars with her hoooooo's, She a good singer, but I gotta admit this is bad
😂😂 biggest joke in country music
It's okay as background music when working. But sounds derivative, overproduced and artificial. I don't understand the video.
Great.   This is all we need.   Country with pop stars singing vibrato horse shit with 47 notes per second garbage music.   Perfect.  😂
If she is a country singer....i,m BATMAN 😂😂😂
esta basura de musica  gano el gramy dios mio que aburrido
❤❤
Congratulations on AOTY Yonce🐝🥳💅🏼
I don't see a ton of likes for any of the songs on the album, seems like a grammy win would have millions of likes.  What am i missing?
Beyoncé when I catch u is the end of
Most comments are exactly 11 months old. They are all  paid for. She is mediocre at best
Beyonce doing country music is off. I feel she wanted to prove something, came up short, and people cheer her on like these are bangers. Texas Hold em was not good. When I hear Morgan Wallen it makes sense. I know this is only one opinion. Sorry if it's not a popular one.
OMG! That's not country that's too sexual nor is it country. What a disgrace to country artists and culture. She flipped the switch I thought it was way better after hearing all the hurah!!! Try again Beyonce I'm sure you can do bettr than this beside showing it all. The song I thought would be better. This is not country I know that's all I hear.
I got to say this is crap. Just cookie cutter stuff. I guess when you serve the devil you'll get a temporary payday on planet Earth, but you end up losing your soul
Awful... 😢
how this fucking shit win the grammy ?
Bellissima lei e bellissima canzone, ritmata e ballabile ❤
Billie deserved the Grammy ❤
Song sucks
I don’t even think Beyoncé herself expected this to win her a Grammy
She deserved the Grammy
Nah... This brought country music to people who don't listen to country music. It's amazing and yall just hating
el album del año era para billie
🤢🤮 -thank God for christian music
Suka wie gdzie wiatr wieje
So this is country now? Cool, good to know.  This is shit
Who here after the Grammy
No country sound for that human.. We don't have to show our TITS to get anywhere.
we all knew about this song after she bought the grammys😂 i literally was like what song won aoty let me listen to it to be fair but it was this😂 i am not even fan of the nominees but ive heard all their songs before except this one didnt know this existed 😂😂😂
Billie deserve it
😂😂
Put some clothes on woman. You have enough ttallent you do not have to be naked too 😢
This is a great country song because they told you it is. In reality it is 💩missing the flies.
Dog shit sing she isn’t anything like us country folk
Un collant, un slip, et un sac poubelle allez go texas !!
Hate it. You are not country and your video sucks.
Not country.......
What is this 😂😂😂😂
Wow ♡°♡
Lack of imagination
This is considered country.....hahahahaha. ok  I feel bad for the current state of the music industry. Horrid.
Glückwunsch für den Grammy 🙏💃💃💃
If you got to come out and sing a horrible song and even worse video with no shirt on it bad money can buy you anything sad
This is hot garbage
WOW THIS SONG IS A FUCKING JOKE TO COUNTRY MUSIC, She didn’t deserve that Grammy at all
This song is horrible lmaoooooo and this won????????????
What a joke 😂
Beyoncé won her first Album of the Year award for Cowboy Carter, and Taylor Swift presented her with Best Country Album.
this song sucks.
I listened to it because it won. It sucks
❤❤❤❤❤ AOTY!!!!
Definitely a huge congratulations on winning a Grammy for this song. I’m so excited to see different diversity for country music. I hope she does more country music songs because she’s really good at it.❤❤
Nope, NOPE, N-O-P-E!!!!
as part of a show, ok...but award...what a joke!
Billie deserved it
Was ist das,  Country Musik ?😕
She put a lot of time doing this video. Lol
This sucks
Show them to me, show them to me Unclasp your jacket and set those puppies free They'd look a whole lot better without that Jacket baby I'm sure you'll agree If you got, two fun bags, Show them to me
Those lyrics are not country at all. Its just the twangy stringed instruments.
Imagine thinking this was country...... &, that its any good....🤔🤢
2025 ✨🎵☄️🎵
Definitely the best song I have ever heard in the past 5 minutes
She Beyonce is a beast her song is very valuable
Not country.
No way she won country
While she does does a nice version of the song, wasn’t this done before %?
Song is garbage this don't deserve no Grammy
You should've lost like how does some shyt like this deserve a Grammy ?
No big deal,cheap video !!
Ugh Billie deserved the award then she does, it’s also a big slap to the face for all country artists :/
Horrible.....
All the racists saying she shouldnt have won, should come listen to this.
What did I just listen too?😮
Grammys was rigged

Sex sells! Substance can take a back seat!! WTF have I just watched?

The song is good but the video clip is very bad.

A Diddy right hand "man" being Highlighted in an Award Show 🤔😤. They just ignore the fact that they have harmed children. Sick!  To comment about the most viral song on her "country album, "This ain't Country, but it still won Country albums  of the year, The rigging and manipulation  are in full gear.".
compared with wildflower, this song deserved nothing (its my opinion!)
Congratulations!! ❤ on album of the year!
Here to see how country this girl is 😂
SHE DID NOT DESERVE THE AOTY GRAMMY WTF
Wtf is this and how did she win album of the year. Damn DEI is at the tail end. Thank God!
This won best country alubm 🤣😂🤔🤨
I hate this song
She's my favorite topless country singer.
To be honest, country music died years ago, so this song belongs on country radio as much as any other song. God, I miss the Possum and the Man in Black.
Not a bad voice... Too bad it's not country music that she is singing.
Good dance song!🥰🌻
If this is country then my truck is a prius
Queen Bee
This is total garbage 😂🥴😒
She slayed the fashion
This song is terrible
The level of creativity is zero. The only reason people watch that video see one of those t@@@s pop out.
She’s not country! Her outfit is awful
They keep hating Beyonce but keep watching.. Look at them loosers and poor people in the comments talking bout Beyonce  Awwn ...what a miserable life y'all got  Poor ahh loosers upset about Beyonce 😊
She is a disgrace..put some clothes .your song sucks you are evil.
Not country music at all, but just as “country” as the rest of the crap coming out of Nashville these days.
Who writes this garbage and she sucks as a country singer
Seriously, this won?  The corruption is everywhere. Unreal.
That's not country music!!! Ever sick🤮
Ah, no, thank you!
So this song won a grammy ☠️, i dont see any speciality in this song honestly
What garbage sounds like 😂
da hell? this is IT?!
This trash isn't country
This shit is NOT country.
This is not country
if this is country I am the top rapper in the world. What a crock of crap.
Oh, yeah. She's making it out of the trash can with this one. Into a bigger trash can though.
What the hell is this dogshit... people actually listen to this???
video is pants.

putting adlibs like WOAH and HEY with a guitar don’t make it country 😭😭😂 this is an embarrassment to country
I saw she had a country song on the Grammys that’s been popping up all over my feed. But I gotta say, I’m not impressed. And this wins an award. Must be a black history month thing. Because she’s definitely not a good county girl.
I don't even listen to country music but this is a complete mockery... Grammys are now just a joke.
Gay ass song
not bad
WTF did I just watch?
Zero class. Country music died about 20 years ago.
What a joke!
Gayest thing ever this is not country you are sad just like post hurting for views
Must have been one of those Kamila Harris voters
Unbelievable 😂 this is awful chris Stapleton carrie underwood
Trashhhh
how is this country? and why did it win a grammy 💀
People complain to much over nothing ya don’t like it stop looking but you all do love it is why your looking so please be quiet ( people can do what they want to do the song not hurting ya ) if it is plug 🎉ya ears and hush with all the hating can ya do any better I think the F not so leave her alone !
Well, that was as expected….. Ridiculous & Fake……
This is pathetic it's not country you got to be joking it sux
That's MOTHERRRR!!!! 🐝🐝🐝🐝
Dad things
Is this some sort of a count sheep to sleep thing? Feels like it could do the same job to me.
A complete joke! THIS IS NOT MUSIC!!
poor videoclip, it misses imagination
Yee haws are mad 😂
Shit song
Hahhh?!?!?!??!!
The song and video repeats over and over again and again… typical with today’s music???
też wygrała bo jest czarna
Horrible
This is a lot better after a few months, I was sick of it when it first came out
This is a bulllcrap country song winning the Grammy for this is terrible, and the industry needs to look into what they're doing, giving out stuff to people who didn't do anything
Horrible
Song sucked honestly. She has a good voice but this isn't her genre. Just seems so fake, like hearing Post Malone do country would sound. Let's have Chris Stapleton win the next award for rap album of the year 😂.
Cant stand this song and the singer🙄
At least the other Grammy nominatees survived 😭
"Less is more"
What a cheap stuff!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why  does she always have to parade around half naked and doing the same stupid thing? Ghetto meets country, Yuck!
Kiepskie to. I za to grammy..? 😢😢😮
Back to the drawing board because this aint country. I wish you and jay z get locked up forever beside diddy
Dumbest video I've ever watched
Overrated
AOTY GIRL!!!
I'm sorry Beyonce I loved your Destiny's child stuff and it's great to sing to your kids but this was not country. You can slap a country logo on it but it's not country. You can't sing country. This only won a Grammy bc people cried about it  and this doesn't make anyone like it anymore. Go back to your drawing board and start over and please don't hurt yourself like this again. People felt sorry for you bc it was really bad. I couldn't stand to listen to the whole song on any of it. Just being honest and not ti hurt your feelings but it sucked.
who's here after it's wining grammy
AOTY 🙌🏽
Is anyone else here to celebrate her winning a Grammy for Best Country Album?
I heard Metallica is busy with a country album.
ALBUM OF YEAR🏆
Stupid looking. Just plain dumb.
Album of the year
She is OVERRATED
Not even "country" wtf is this shiii?
So PC she doesn’t fire a real pistol😂. This is weak!!
Witchcraft boooolsheeit
After all of the negativity, she has a Grammy for this album...way to go Beyoncé...they can hate but they can't stop a thing.
So this is the album that won...
This is ridiculous and not country. Why is she swearing in her songs? It sounds more like pop music urban gospel.
Go girl
meh ? Well as it is musical, but it's not country, and she ain't no Martina McBride. And the video I watched... OK?
There’s no way this won over… anything..
rigged
wtf is this....
Why is she half naked....and what is the point here...???  She just won album of the year for this one the Grammys.....I can't see why...for this...the other artists had allot more hits on their albums.....smh....
JOKE
🤣🤣🤑🤑
BEYONCE WON ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!!! WOO-HOO!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Garbage
Awful “music.”  Disgraceful to the genre.
isss a bbbBLACK  WOMan singing "country".   We must give thumbs up!!!!
any girl at an open mic night with a voice could do better if they had all the people she has to write her music and several of the top producers doing their work so she sings into  auto tune and goes home.  its all a facade

Boring song. Please don't change country music to this monotonous stuff too. 😢
This is trash how did you just win a grammy
This is just straight trash 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
When she won “Best Country Album” … I stopped watching the Grammy’s… What A Joke!!
لونببلن😍
why does she have to use some of the unsavory language and sexy nothing for clothes? I will never understand someone with a great voice just pushes profanity, sex and money in her videos. Sad, just sad.
Cowboy carter's tour loading 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Why dressed like a …
BEYONCE JUST WON HER FIRST COUNTRY MUSIC GRAMMY!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is this a joke song making fun of country music or something? This might be the worst song ever recorded
si gana esta cagada es porque lo compro o porque los amenazo con descuartizarlos y dejarlos enterrados en su patio para luego reportarlos como desaparecidos igual que el michael jackson
Maaaadd 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I love Americans they're like the children of Europe they are our children ❤
The song sound's kinda like Country but the video is a million lite yr's from it
She can't sell an album without being naked.  Why can't sing without showing their body.
do people actually like this?
Grammy Awards: For Best Record of the Year! Beyonce- Texas Hold Em..haha..too soon🤣 It will be! Has to be since alot is going down with the Diddy case..🤣 Jay Z, only a matter of time Beyonce gets pulled and people find out not so innocent!!

Here's my thing.  I absolutely 💯 love this song. The video sucks!  Such a good song but I don't want to watch soft porn shit. You don't need that girl. You are fine. Get to the heart of the song.❤😊

Not bad. The music and flow is country with a distinctive Beyonce sound.
CountryRAP Nope.

Disgusting video! Does not belong in country video!
I see you've reverted back to angry tam tam. Poor baby, you'll get over it.
Yessss
For me this came off as a little weird for her.
Que video mas tonto, basico
It's very dive bar 🍺
Thank you beyonce

Nobody cares about this song, bro. She’s not a country girl stop it. We do not care.
This song is great
Best Country ever ❤  Country lovers i'm sorry but it's my decision
❤❤🎉
Beyoncé own that country music. What's the temp on the floor.....dance floor shucking and diving? Visions, vivid, faded, recycled. It means what it means,.....all the means.
2025 January! Oldie but Goodie!
A hittt
chat don’t forget to thank Beyoncé!
Dont wrry ice cube is here

Taylor said haters gonna hate hate hate.
Just learned the line dance to this. I’ll gladly be teaching it for black history month 😎
You don't need to take your  clothes off, you're good enough Beyonce!!
ابك نهيداتك طالعه ي حرمه
I like this song, very catchy.....
#Theupshaws put me on just now 😂
Worst crap i ever heard. Tell the truth people.  The truth will set you free !!!!! Lmao😂😂😂😂😂
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now surpassed 600 million Spotify streams! This is Beyoncé's 11(12)th song to reach this milestone! Keep streaming! 🐝👑
Bey has donated 2.5 million to victims of the LA. fires.Thats 2.5 million more than her deteractors.
Spot je ,,propast,, video od četri sekunde vrte cijelu pjesmu😂😂
Smash hitt!!!
🖤💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾🖤
Motherrr
Song of the year
All your hate is late, the song is already double platinum and went to number one in 56 countries. Deal with it.
Omg amazing i love u b ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hope u find Jesus truly
Im learning this goofy ahh song for a school presentation.
Swifties still crying? You need to let it go.
She wanted a grammy for this shit?
When did singers decide appearing almost naked added to their talents..is this her hubby's influence... just makes her look cheap and the video is crap...
So this is ain't women sexualization? Snake on one eye - sure no symblism at all...hope we can finally open our eyes on their cult and who are they serve
gut ist, dass Beyonce bescheiden ist und nur auf Ihre Stimme zählt und nicht auf Äußerlichkeit
Tandeta, a nie gwiazda
Texans don’t dress like that.
Beyoncé made country music
Einfach mega💪🏻❤️
Anyone January 2025?
If you child DO Not Warch😮
Bit rude
Beyois still fire and I love the old school vibe.
Only me think that this song is so copied by READY TO RUN (one direction)
A pop star promoting to shoot people down to improve her image... Hopefully the creators of this propaganda of violence will be held accountable like after the nazi regime. Most people are too dumb to realize the media are the cause of the terrible condition of this world and are just applauding for their stars (like during the nazi regime).
Beyonce is Jesus❤
Doesn't feel like a Beyonce song at all
Now thats a woman.❤️
lol so good
Hope no fires in Texas happen🤣🤣😩😩
IF BEYONCE WERE AN ARTIST TRYING TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT STATEMENT, AS WITH NFL NETFLIX HALFTIME SHE WOULD HAVE MORE SENSE AND DECENCY THAN TAKE ON PORTRAYING HERSELF LOOKING LIKE A HO AND LIP SYNCING...... CHEAP AND AIRHEAD AT THAT.
Anyone 2025

I like to play this while taking out the trash
When your old man pays for everything, of course, you're top! And part of Diddys group, they will all tumble soon. Long way to fall.
Rolling Stone named bey's lemonade album best of the century. Yee-haw!
Beyoncé made d!e Aaliyah Left eye and Michel Jackson 😢

Texas hold'em double Platinum. Went to number one in 56 countries. a lot of people must like this.
I'm so glad I'm not from Texas, I would be ashamed. Looks like a lot of people don't really care for this.
wtf is this , Jesus put some clothes on , let’s see what you sound like without being naked , because this ain’t a strip pole Beyoncé stick to pdiddies gang .
She doesn't look country. Don't sound country. Here words aren't even country. Please just go back to Rock Nation😂
Best way to listen to this is turn it up REAL LOUD....then hit mute!!

JAN.2025
It's an abomination of country music, absolute shite
Happy Birthday Blue Ivy we appreciate what you are doing  for our communities, Love you Always
En Chile decir negr@ no es peyorativo ni mucho menos un insulto. A veces decir negro qliao, corre con 3 piernas (Usain Bolt) o, negra rica me enamore.... suena a? Los morenos afrodecendientes son mejores que muchos.... Ahora son afroamericanos y son nuestros hermanos.
💯
1️⃣0️⃣
Shania Twain was doing this style with REAL musicions 30 years ago. And Dolly Parton
contrive exploitative crap that will appeal to those who have never heard the ones she tries to imitate.
a cheap imitation of Dolly Parton and Shania Twain.
The most monotonous and repetitive eye candy ever 😂 completely out of sync with the song. I'd expect more dancing and more DANCERS. Such a disappointment, that's not what one imagines while listening to this very well conceived song
492
Anyone January 2025?
Wat a ztrange video
Happy New Year everyone 🎉🥳  still listening in 2025❤
cheap ass video, mediocre song
Never liked her music, keep singing too Ur daddy
Yyaall had fun
O I for got mover righter lol ❤😂🎉😢😮😅😅😊😊😊
Goodnight to all my stalkers. Sweet dreams.
Beyonce's cowboy Carter album outperformed your favorite female country artist in 2024.
This music is garbage. What a disgrace to the country music. Stick to R&B, cause this ain’t it.
😮
The fact you do the take it to the Flo now shows this isn’t country. No country artist does that shit.
This ain’t countryyyy so set your mic down down down down
To everyone who TRULY DISLIKES this, it's okay, you're not alone!!
FK this song blows ass
MAGA got pissed at Beyonce because this song made number one on the country music lost lmao 😂
Feliz Año 2025!!!Beyoncé!!!preciosa canción!!!UN ABRAZO GRANDE PARA TÍ desde Valladolid, España 👍👏👏👏👏❤️💛❤️🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🌲🌲🌲🥂🥂🥂🎶🎼🎵🎶🎼🎵🙏🙏🙏
This can't be the same Beyonce that sang "Irreppaceable"...this has to be a prank right?
Back then but year on it's south Africa
15th district see o find the leak
Keeper and rte 26
Beyonce, what's wrong with you...??? (P Diddy)
Fact, Beyonce not deserved a Grammy the year lol
I don't know what this is but it ain't country. I will not be listening again 😔
Anyone January 2025🤠
Boring vid, even the audio is so overcompressed that it continuously clips at the peaks. Don't understand why ''sound engineers'' ruin dynamics in music nowadays. But obviously it sells...
Thank u
Am i the only one that doesn't get the focused nudity of a great song, or are we only liking this song because of the nudity .. or suggestion of it. Music should be about quality of sounds not being perfect, not about being half naked to sell .. my opinion, but nudity is getting to much focus to sell a record  .. sorry
Why Video this?
Wtf
My first listen for the year. It was my most played song last year.❤
Star academie ?
Anyone 2025??😢
People may like this but i can tell you... This is the furthest thing from a country song. Grow tf up and deal with it.
Who else hears ‘hip replacement’ at 00:46? 🙈😅
PURE GARBAGE 🤮
worse performance ever!! no effort whatsoever, shame on you B
Anyone in 2025 ?
Thank you beyonće

Anyone may 1492?
Listen to lyrics carefully. Tornado in the basement. Whose basement? Diddy's?
Park your Lexus???...in the country?? Yuck and no, we don't drive lexus in the country. Also what the eff is this video
Me
Diddy and his “brother”, JayZ, are about to get more time to hang out. Victims are saying that Beyonce is just as involved in the crimes.
Wasn’t my kinda country! Good songs don’t need almost x-rated videos
First from 2025 😂😂❤ anybody else?
Anyone in January 2025
Song is catchy. The video, not so much.
Having Blues in the song made it Great.
Allie sherlick sings your song better
One big reason we don't need Beyonce in Country music can't sing and dressed like this
my rental agent loves this song
Reminds me of Jasmine from Thailand
THANK YOU BEYONCE I LIKE YOU SONG😊❤❤❤
THE QUEEN ❤️
Anyone here after her Nfl halftime Christmas performance?
The way she controls her voice and also compliment it is just AWESOME ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aahhhhh ❤ AMWWWWWW 💜
Texas!!!!
2024❤
I wish USA unites once more. Under trump’s government.
She is not a Country artist and will never be a Country artist. She needs to stay with the genre that she has been singing with. This just feels like a big slap in the face to true Country music. 😡😡😡
Romain lié
❤
Here after the Christmas halftime show
This is your worst album
Boring, award winning for horrible... how disappointing.  Try Led Zeppelin "Hot Dog" and compare for yourself...

Bahahaha
here after the NFL
This song is terrible
This is fucking horrible...
I feel like this video is still missing something.😜
Porra a entrada parece Pra você guardei o amor - Nando Reis
Gracias Beyoncé
Calculate that your soul is building a young man while you are the one who sees you vomiting, take off your clothes and even your skin and rest
You Right You Ain’t TEXAS!!!  Bye Felicia!!
A bey dançando com a Blue no NFL performance tavam tão perfeitas,amooo meus bebês
That outfit was really necessary? Can't she afford clothes, i.e. some trousers, a shirt or something?
Doesn't sound country to me, like RnB trying to be country
good song stupid video
This is supposed to be country god awful
Best believe Jan14h something major is Queen👸🏼Bey Brewin…….
Garbage
Probably one of cheapest music videos out there.
OMG this is terrible ...... if this all she's got in Country forget you..... there way too many Country ladies that out sing Beyonce No Thank you 😂😂😂
January 2025 🇧🇷
WHAT KIND OF CALIFORNIA GARBAGE IS THIS CRAP?!
She didn't get nominated for country awards because this isn't country
A great way to start 2025...reminds me of great harmonizing and incredible song!
https://youtu.be/JAhrMH3-KPo?si=-ssKn5GXtnId40-D in 1970s these guys Texas eared a feared regime…….  See what they can come up with against oppression.  As a concerned neighbor and fellow tribes man the orchestra is the process. Play it to the rhythm where them guns 🎉❤😂😂😂😂
Not a huge country fan, but I have to admit that take it to the floor now part at the end 🔥🔥🔥
30 years in texas music and tell you this stinks. No hook and the music is pop with a few banjo riffs. Only payola explains this.
What crap
Lmfao
Don't like it
You Suck!
So Obscene and Dirty. Inappropriate for kids.
I still love this song. Who else listening to it in December 2024 ?   ... from Fort Worth, Texas
Passed around Diddy parties.
When your in a satancult(nm) like b you will get all you ever dreamed of, Untill the king of kings returns soon, Look into the people you think are "amazing"
A_L_T_I_Y_A_N_C_H_I_L_D_S Mindblowing5hrvid
This vid changed my whole view on the song a thought this was sunshine and rainbows
First & last time I watch this
Trash
3:
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is "good"!?😂
I never judge without hearing. And this ain't country. This is a bunch of country clichés put into one musical effort. And for those out there that wanna play the race card, it doesn't have anything to do with the color of skin. Shania Twain used to be country and after a few years, her music wasn't worthy of being called country. Nothing wrong with you if you like this composition, but it isn't country music.
So inappropriate for kids
She really does sound terrible
Decent pop song not country tho. But commend her for trying
Me
Could possibly be the worst song ever written. Seriously, all hype and zero substance
This is pure 2024 garbage
So bad
Disgusting. As a legitimate Texan who HAS been through a tornado, im “glad” this crock of shit took country artist of the year. Virtue signaling much? This is legit dogshit to have taken any title other than garbage. I take nothing in this music industry seriously anymore, basically said fuck all those that make country for a living for this wannabe shit.
Garbage song but I think Beyoncé is great if she stays in her own genre . She isn’t country
I love Beyonce ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ the queen 👑 bee ❤❤❤❤
Looks just like the 3td ward street walker she always has been
When u only spend 1000 bucks on a music video
This ain't Texas...proceeds to act Texan.
Gm ca
No. This is not country music
Kamala give her $10 million dallars to make 10 sec mv
Being from MT born and raised I can tell you this isn't country.
This isn’t country this is garbage ☠️😂
Hoooooe loopin
This song is terrible 😂
Beyonce is dressed inappropriately I wouldn't want kids to see that it's indecent
She sucks
Bey put that country music right in y'all's face! ❤️❤️❤️
This is awful. Both the song and this stupid “visual”.🤢🤢🤢
Jay z is one lucky man
Stupid sqank.. the NFL players get fined for make believe pistol pointing.. but it’s ok for royalty:)
Buckle bunny.
This is not country music.
Leave countrysingintoothe ehiteprople
This was one of the biggest songs in the year 2024
🐝
It is so sad that she's dressing this way thinking it's talent all she's doing is letting other girls think the only way to make it in this world is just show your body off. Your body's sacred your body is yours you can still put on a great costume and a great show and keep your body covered. Beyonce please be a better example to the youth today cover your body up please
If I want a strip show I'll go to a strip joint
Just terrible music
NOT EVEN CLOSE to be considered "country music" in any way at all!
Here on the 26th of December 2024, after watching the 25th of Drcbwr Beyonce Bowl!
This is not country music apart from the fact that it was recorded in a country. What's next death metal country?
What is this horsesht? No wait that’s disrespectful to horsesht everywhere.
She's way too gifted to feel the need to dress like a Hustler girl. C'mon Bey.
Proof pop country is trash.
So does she pay Lyle royalties…?  (See LA County)…
Who here super balls ?❤️❤️❤️  Queen 👸🏽 B❤
Lip sync 😅😮😅😅😊
Crap, crap, crap
😂
Love the lyrics “we headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice “.  Because living in the simple life of the deep country areas with no money going to the local bar thats a complete dive always seems nice to folks who don’t know no better.
I love this 💯🥰 🔥🔥
Thank you Beyoncé!!!
Beyonce is absolutely stunning here. The songs a great catchy pop choon.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who’s here after NFL performance?? 😂❤
Who's here after the NFL half show 😭

Songs okay, could be better without the foul language and maybe a little more clothes because the outfit doesn't look that good for the song she is singing.
She did this cause she claimed she was dogged at ACA. Let me go to SOURCE Awards. Get booed out in the first 15 seconds.
Jajajaja.  ... Mari carmen    ?? Onde vas cuando está el fuego?!...

Not very good for her voice
Not a fan, and didn't deserve Best Female Artist in the Country music awards. I said what I said
You're joking right? Now the country girls have to slut out too... and this is a good song?
Garbage
Trash
That's not the country look
You are so p bro no
Anybody into real old school country hates this for a list of reasons. Can you find them all?
What a disgrace to country music.  Seriously an award?  I guess everyone gets an award even if you suck as a country singer.
♠️♣️♦️♥️♦️🫦
This is what my gay teacher listens to
Thank you Beyonce
There’s no way this win top female country artist of the year .. billboard is lying bro. Flat out
Nope, it’s fry from what they told me!
Linda de mais
This is terrible 😂
Why are people upset with her this was pretty good lol
The #QueenB  It’s a tornado somewhere 🌪️
She needs to be in jail  and jay z ...people stop following trash!
This is pure Trash !!
I listen to this song every day and it is so good my dad sings along
Fygr green
This is trash.
Just to distract the country music industry. She is disrespectful and of the devil. True country isn't like this.
I have a feeling this video won't be up for a choreography award. LOL!!!!
Beyoncé will always be one of the greatest singers the world is so happy to have!
I haven’t liked country music since the early 2000’s and this video gives me all the more reason to continue my dislike. This is the worst video I’ve ever seen.  Disrespectful and disgusting!
Love the song but thus video is incredibly boring
BEYONCE BILLBOARD TOP COUNTRY FEMALE ARTIST. 🧑‍🌾❤️❤️❤️❤️🏆
Good morning
❤❤You look amazing and so much more❤❤Thank you for a lovely tune❤❤
The song is okay (C-) but I would not  play it again, or pay for it.. This song and video feels trashy and angry, not vibrant and powerful. Her music used to be a lot better.
@TH33FOLKLORE got the craziest Beyonce diss
@TH33FOLKLORE went all in with this Beyonce diss. Called her bluff its the most truth spoke listen to her song Hold Up instead of Hold em and say she aint got something like stranger things
Please stop making music 🙏
What a joke this trash is !!
Gay
How was this song even created. Did they not listen to it before they released it.
So this what  our   Children   See and want to dress   Like ?,,,,??
I don't wanna see Beyonce ever again
It's not a bad song but there's too much swearing in it for country music
Jinkx & dela 2024 xmas show
I’m bumping this song again.
e uma diva de todos tempos. simplesmente a melhor
Beyoncé for a reason!  So sad about this news on Jay-Z. 😢
monotonous, boring
♥️♥️♥️
Beyoncé overrated
Beyoncé should go to jail for what she did she murdered Michael Jackson
Jesus Christ, this is terrible
You should stop... Hip Hop and r&b is your jam.... Close your top and your venture into country... It's atrocious...
Beyhive 🐝🐝🐝🐝
This lets the haters know that the queen b can do anything
Oh my girl give it up 🤮👿

D to

❤❤❤❤
According to spotify Beyonce brought 36 million new listeners to country music. Full-stop.
Franklin theme
This isn’t a bad song but it’s not country. It’s more pop with Country vibes.
5 wars I'm ashamed of Texas.  No no no I'm from New Mexico.  I graduated Ft Bliss TX Basic training TWICE.  Texans tell me every day...El Paso...pst...too many Mexicans...El Paso ISNT TEXass.
Beyonce is a wonder and also a diddler.
I like this song a lot keep singing gorgeous add keep God first sending blessings
I'm sorry, but this is some bs mammy wanna be country music 🤣. Woof.
The video is very distracting. I hardly even hear the song.
Arriba, abajo, al centro, y adentro”
Nope stick to your lane
0:46 That's what he does to those who don't thank him.
Don't forget to thank Beyonce
Не о чем,не голоса,не фигуры....
the video is MAHVELOUS !    the best most excellent video ever made in the whole wide world
A revista People elegeu o COWBOY CARTER, da Beyoncé, como o melhor álbum de 2024. 🥇  “Passando do ballroom para o honky-tonk, Queen Bey faz um álbum country do seu jeito: uma obra ambiciosa e que desafia o gênero.”
Billboard elegeu “Cowboy Carter” como o segundo melhor álbum de 2024 ✨  “Cowboy Carter não é o resultado de Beyoncé ‘provando’ a si mesma aos guardiões do gênero country que antes a afastaram: é uma rejeição, recuperação e reconstrução de todo tipo de Americana em nome da excelência negra.   Ao longo deste novo épico, Beyoncé reconta sua própria história dentro do contexto dos grandes mitos americanos, ao mesmo tempo em que eleva seu próprio som e estilo para se adequar ao assunto em questão. “Perfeição” está longe de ser a marca em um álbum como  Cowboy Carter  — e isso torna esta obra-prima extensa muito mais fascinante de ouvir repetidamente.”
Joka perkeleen kerta täällä on joku valopää" who is lstening this 2024?
2026?
no one sude lissen to this punk no more
terrible song
Beyoncé I really like your song like this song and so I decided to draw a picture of you and it turned out really good. It looks exactly like you. I look so good. You look really cool in the picture.❤❤❤
Sem comentários.  Rainha.  ❤❤
bring country into different level
Eww.
This is not country at all actually a disgrace to country music that this would even be considered country music
this is not even music
La chanson ouais mais etre à moitié à poil ? C est signe d etre arrivée pas trop haut quand on est obligé de montrer son cul ou ses seins dans un clip
Beyonce the queen! Greatest pop star of the 21st century!❤️❤️❤️❤️
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP??? Go back to Motown
Dobro..

Je trouve qu'elle n'a aucune crédibilité dans ce style. Elle s'est toujours cantonnée au RnB. Les succès de Taylor Swift  l'a très certainement motivée. On essaie d'être célèbre comme on peut. Chacun son style ce n'est pas le sien, très clairement. Elle a voulu surfer sur la vague de la country pour élargir son public et tenter de dépasser Taylor Swift. je ne suis pas fan de Taylor Swift mais elle est bien plus crédible tout comme Shaboozey ou Miley Cyrus... Quand je pense à ces journalistes de gauche qui ont osé affirmer que ceux qui n'aiment pas le titre de Beyoncé sont des racistes. Ils sont clairement très limités du citron, très binaires et n'ont aucune connaissance du milieu musical actuel. Ce n' est pas parce qu'on est né dans ce coin des EU qu'on est légitime. Elle ne l'a jamais approché ou alors juste dernièrement par opportunisme espérant rafler à Taylor Swift une victoire qu'elle ne mérite clairement pas d'ailleurs je pense que ça a fait un flop on ne l'entend plus en France ce fameux "tube"... Je pense qu'elle même n'y croyait pas d'avantage pour vendre ainsi ses charmes.. une astuce pour pallier le manque de crédibilité ?
Love the song - not the video
She's no Miranda Lambert 😂 in fact this is not country
Who is afraid of her😅..but she is so so good..i love her song😊😢
❤❤❤
Pfff 🐱
This sux ass
Taz 🌪️ 🌍🌎🌏
Watching YT videos with my grandkids and this came on. Oh my. My 14 year old boy yelled out something, the 12 year old girl said “she needs to cover up” and my 8 year old granddaughters covered their eyes. Me? I quickly turned off the remote thanks to a kick to the leg from my wife…
Beyonce wear some clothes BTW love your singing such a pretty voice and singer
So sexual
I guess she knows right?
Супер. Україна. Київ 2:36
I'm not a country music fan. She makes country music not suck. That's impressive.
idiokracja
❤
👎👎👎 Using body for view is dirty and the song is bad and vocal too
Beyonce gets attacked and criticized so much I feel it's petty and ridiculous she is a beautiful talented artist
Aí dentinha
I should cover this song in slow form and melt it !! 😛
Je n’arrive pas à me décider si ce clip vidéo est une pure arnaque ou du pur génie 😅🤣
You guys should go listen to the Franklin intro song lol... this song is a little faster but pretty much the same hahhahaha
i think this is the best video and should get a grammy
I love how she tries to be country but she doesnt understand that country is about hard working men, God, America and cracking a beer shes talking about none of that
Trash!
Guys, it's a visualizer not a music video
❤❤❤❤
That's uncouth, and shows who she is. Song is terribly 🥴😤
This ain't Texas ain't no hold em

Texas Hold und das Video, eine reine Katastrophe. Beyonce singt hier nicht, sie eiert hier irgendwie wie eine zweifelhaftes Viertklässler Reeperbahn Görre rum. Nicht einmal ihre Bewegungen sind synchron. Den im Hintergrund aufgenommen Song wurde zigfach auf eine Spur gebracht, nee, nee, möchte gerne wissen wie es Beyonce das Live hinkriegen soll. Ich halte Beyonce für ein künstliches Produkt der Musikindustrie. Singen kann diese Frau Live nämlich nicht!!
Trash
Bro is doing the exact same thing and her song isn’t even good and her outfit 🤮
I cant believe people actually think this is country wtf is wrong with people

I didnt listen to your music much at first, nothing personal, you definitely had a voice.  Just the frequencies and vibrations were a good fit for me at the time.  Heard all kinds of crazy shit about you being in the illuminati.  I know you are, but in a more historic sense.  The illuminati was originally the keepers of ancient secrets, mathmaticians, magicians, etc.  Merlin was illuminati.  My friend bridget has a friend i havent met yet.  Orangecoffeemusic.  She plays sax for you.  She does her own music too which is pretty amazing.  Just wanted to say hi friend.  I am sure our paths will cross at some point with so many connections.  I never believed you were anything but a pure soul.  And this particular song resonates with my beliegs and visions for the world so much.  Gotta fly, but thank you.  If tou get a chance, ask orangecoffeemusic to share with you.  She has one called listen that i really love, even bilingual tracks.
Beyoncé eu usei pó de arroz quando era adolescente

🔑 Beyoncé essa é a chave da minha amizade dou pra você Beyoncé a chave da minha amizade
That’s not a country song . Just another trash hip hop /r&b
One of the dumbest albums ive ever heard lol. To each their own  mafia queen
Beyonce doesn't deserve any of the Grammys she was nominated for. I'm sure she's also responsible for Liam Payne's death. I have no doubt that she bribed the founders of the Grammys for nominations. she has 32 Grammys that she didn't even deserve. she is nominated for an album that is not popular at all. in my opinion she should have been in jail a long time ago. she is responsible for several tragic deaths of celebrities just to be a star. let's look at the fact that not one of her songs is popular. then why would she have so many undeserved awards.I can also say that everyone is truly afraid of her. not because of her success, but because of bullying. a lot of celebrities gave acceptance speeches in which they said that Beyonce deserved this award. when Taylor Swift received an award, Beyonce's ally appeared on stage during her acceptance speech and said that Taylor didn't deserve the award more than Beyonce. What does that tell you? It's Beyonce  really dangerous for all celebrities. I really have no doubt that something will happen to Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter and other young artists who are now more popular than Beyonce.
Her next country song will be, Welcome to my Double Wide.
Song of the Year? Are you kidding me.
I’m not 24 all the winners go to Nashville,,,  here i come. Miranda rights must be told  I was never given mine       ; red is here now. God bless this song today; 11/8/24 8:45 AM. WHAT CAN WE DO TODAY
Don’t like this album , Grammy ???? LOL

😉😆Isaiah 9:16. Those who guide➡ these people are the same ones who misguide them,😵💫😳 and those who are guided allow themselves to be seduced and led into error.☹😮 By whom are you guided? By your sinful desires, by greed for wrong things? Do you allow yourself to be seduced by fame, money,💰💰 by the glory of this world?🌎🌏 Jesus is returning every day for millions of people, one day your time will come. If your life is like this, he will not be able to take you to Heaven; instead, evil spirits will take you to suffering from which you will never be able to escape.😰😫😭Come to Jesus, read the Bible.

Beyoncé ajuda faiz ter aqui no Brasil várias farmácias de ervas
I’ve never been a fan of Beyoncé, but this song can easily get lost in your head, and you can’t shake it. Besides that, I do have to say this.  Experimenting with different genres can help, until you find your voice, all new singers that break out into the music scene do this.  But for Beyoncé who’s been doing R&B, pop and hip hop music for as long as she has to jump ship to country is a big leap. Her voice is a powerhouse in the other genres of music and that’s been her vibe for all of her musical life. It’s great she’s expanding her repertoire and trying her hand at Country, and  Country musicians welcomed her with open arms to the country music  family.  But with her vocals mixing with country music is an absolute long shot. I admit country music isn’t what it used to be, it’s a little more poppy, but there some artist’s that love to go back to the traditional ways of what country music use to be. But in the case of Miss Beyoncé, there are already Country Queens. I’d rather her be in the zone where she has been labeled a queen in her more recognized career.

😂Nn fare il puttanone si chiama potenza #Sebastiani
She is very sexy and beautiful and can dance
Das Video ist halt leider total sinnlos gemacht. Aber das Lied ist toll
I’m just seeing this video, it keeps replaying her walking and pointing her finger as a gun. I think there is a glitch. At least I hope it is.
Nasty Diddy girl is she at diddy party
She will be locked up with diddy Jz soon Trump 2025 Oprah will be there too
Beyoncé faiz investimento no Brasil e faiz aqui no Brasil plantações de laranja
Beyoncé faiz investimento no Brasil e faiz aqui no Brasil plantações da fruta manga
Beyoncé traiz divisas políticas aqui pro Brasil e faiz investimento na educação e traz fábricas
Such trash.... she didn't deserve Ye's admiration.
This is not country honestly it is country pop but it still ate
Beyoncé God bless you a tua política
Beyoncé parabéns pela política
She Knows..
Does anyone else feel like she or whoever is trying to make fun of country music?
Great country song! Very well sung, as always.
Awful!
the cheese testicle guy brought me here
Okayyy I like her Levi's commercial before the song comes on 💙💙💙
Dis kak
I want to thank Beyonce for making this music video
Have you noticed all these black singers and actors are running to KUM'ALL'YA they worried about going to prison with Diddy and she their only hope to keep from going away a long time....They praying Kumallya wins and will pardon them....
Thank you Beyoncé
Bro shes a killer
Asher’s reaction at the end was cute❤ you see Nevada this is why you and asher are perfect for eachother❤❤❤❤

Shit Killer
She needs to put her clothes on
Worst music video in history
She Knows
Anyone here after P Diddy arrest and stuff about beyoncè
😀
She's so tacky. If you want to hear a rockin funny cover of this check out Tommy Johansson's version. He was Sabaton's lead guitarist until earlier this year. Now he's back with his old band.Majestica,and also does fun covers for all kinds of songs. He's awesome. Here's the url for it:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJOS6trEfI
Wow a naked cowgirl. Nope
Culture vulture
I want here blocked from my music!!
Yea Alicia Keys is a very beautiful woman. 🥰😍😚😊😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beyoncé doesn't care to make actual music videos anymore!
LETS THANK BEYONCE WHEN CELEBRITIES WIN THE REWARD!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
🍓
They excessive black and white and one eye is wild for Beyoncé. Clearly they got a cult they are part of. But maybe it’s kind of falling apart given Diddys demise
#rps 😘
Thank you beyoncè
Queremos justicia por que tan cayados hollywood que se sepa la verdad y comiencen a rodar cabezas

This song sucks. Its so boring and generic
How are you beyonce after Adele sharing half of her Grammy and my favorite singer is still left eye which is Lisa Lopes. Why do you want popularity when you already have 32 Grammy or whatever, like chill and let other people shine too. You just need p diddy for this? Wow!

I know that Beyonce is from Texas, with Creole heritage, but i just don’t feel like country music works with her style. It just feels…off.
i dont get it. she hhas a great voice and i love it, shes beautiful, sexy. stage performer.. shes really my idol. but after i heard the news.? why shes so jealous and full of insecurities to other artist.    if news cerculating online is true..? ow my...
Fookin shit music
We all need to shut the f****** because none of us is in the music industry to know what the f*** is going on.
Diddy party
This is the official clip?? I regret looking up for it 🙄🙄💩
Y’all going to jail….
Respect to Beyoncé and all! Frfr. You still got it. But I would love love love to see more than your skin. This album was such a shift and and such a brave leap…wish you could have let it speak for its self.
Apelona.... NENHUM POUCO  !!!
It's not nice to kil.l someone.  🙃🙂
It’s amazing that other Country singers can crossover to other genres but when a gifted artist like Beyonce does it with so much style ….not even recognition!!Sounds like “Country twisted jealousy!

This was his last video if I'm not wrong. She published this video where she appears as if she had a gun and with one eye covered. Strange.. Some time later we notice about diddy

Wrost song, wrost singer ever
Country Baphy, how cute
Hello with all my respect. Impressive song. My cards were clubs 9 and diamonds 10. With the Texas hold ´em 5 cards already (Oct 10th 2024 circa 2351 time. And I made a photo of that cards.) in front of me, hearts 10, hearts Jack, clubs 3, diamonds 9, spades 7, I have 2 pairs with two tens and two nines. I am alone, and only with God and Jesus. What´s a possible meaning of my cards, or how it´s seen? I remember only 2 bad human pairs once being simultaneously against me in my life. But why this? I had even no personal interest in those and their lives. Best Regards Uli/Ulrich Peter HAMBERGER, Dr. h.c. RV/U.S.A. of Business, MBA in Europe/Dipl.-Kfm. Univ. FAU Nuremberg, in 5 continents 1992-1981 and 4 times in U.S.A. 1992-1986.🙂

Buena canción
Guys, it's just a theory, but she knows
She knows
Worst song ,worst outfit ... Her voice 🙄
She knows
This is exactly how Beyonce wins ... Down down down 🔫
Esa morena toda pedante y odiosa que nunca le dirige la palabra a los reporteros o las personas ordinarias....hasta vi un video que estaba en Francia...y sus guardaespaldas dando ordenes a los franceses de que no podian grabarla cuando ellos estaban en espacios publicos y en su propio pais...hasta donde llegaba su arrogancia...la verdad si quiero verla caer...con tanta arrogancia se lo ha ganado... Pd. I love you AALIYAAH..
Good song . Video sucks though
She knows!
Give Beyoncé a break how many husbands have secrets from their wives. Don’t believe everything you hear it’s nonsense
Johnson Scott Hall William Martinez Sharon
I listened to the 'latest' type of country music.....and wtf THEY  NEED Beyoncè more than she needs TEHEM......for real!
Gotta thank Beyoncé for this wonderful day ❤😂
Yeah go-on Bey ...i heard all the nonsense around her being sunbed at the country awards and my take on it is.....  SHE WAS !!
Is this the official video? Huh???
I looooooveee you ❤Beyoncé
Katelin Place
Dang and I thought Beyoncé was a good person (I’m sorry to the people who had to mention Beyoncé to survive)

Escuchando a Beyonce para que nadie venga por mi,  Gracias Beyonce por protegerme
This song is absolutely dumb it's not even country all it's about is basically what she put together watching  the news in her La home trying to prove to everyone she can do country music I think it's an absolute disgrace to the real country artists  and she knows nothing about living in the country  looking like a harlot trying to get men to lust over her disgusting all she is is a tool for the music industry a concrete cowgirl that will probably be her next new song 🤣 what is this world coming to.
I thought I was the only one here 2024
She knows!
um..
Beyonce deserves a  cma award button🤠❤️~~>>>>>
Blah, I can see why she got zero award nominations for this.
I stop being  a fan of her because she knows evethings in those parties 🎉
Boa musica
What a shitty video.  Did she think dressing like a whore was going to be well received by country fans?   The country fans aren't going to let her taint country music like those skanks did to hip hop.  We use to have Missy Elliot now it's crap like Ice Spice and Doja Cat
No soul. It's almost like a computer generated it
MAGA
Aliyah, Left Eye we love you rest in peace . She knows.
Imagin puting this song in the diddy parties. Crazyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Me wake up but i forgot thanks to byonce😶😶😶 or me when i have A from exam but i forgot thanks to byonce😶😷😲😭😢
Country darf Pop machen, Pop aber nicht Country, finde den Fehler....
Uhh not Country whatsoever...what is this
Setan wanita
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢

RIP AALIYAH!!!!!
How can she doo that to other celebs like that
gotta rip off franklins theme song for fame, shit show much https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqyE-lWqCE&ab_channel=TEOLTaylor
this is kinda freaky ..
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared Sounds awfully familiar 😅 This is the most stupid, annoying song ever
Fuckin shit
Good song. Horrible video. 10,000 rotten rotten tomatoes
❤😊
Her songs arent even good now i know why shes so popular
Mid
The video is repetitive.
"I am in jail, I am in handcuffs,  and I am going, down, down,  down, down, down!"  🤣
Con la contagiosa musica no puedo decir no.
Now everyone say thank you!!
OK don't listen just watch.
this is ridiculous, how people can like this garbage?
What a boooooring video😢.
Яка песничка 🇧🇬
I still like Beyonce
Definitely not country. Did she really think she could gain a country following for coming out with a Country album. Sorry sister, no CMA for you. Another thing sister, female Country singers don't have to flaunt their bodies to or dress provocative for attention. Best to stay in your own world.
Stupid video. Stay in your own lane. Just like Dolly being inducted into the RRHF???  WTF!!!🤣😂🤣😂
SHE KNOWSS
Horrible
Pdd
Why is this so freaky
She's going to be singing this song in cuffs with Jay Z and Diddy😂😂
I came here to say this is garbage music
This can't really be the video right lol
❤
This is garbage
She knows…
Stop listening to the music of this monster until they crack and confess everything please for Michael Jackson, aaliyah, left eye and others whose existence we may not know please 🛑🛑🛑
Who hold EM ..
Finally a country song other than Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson worth listening to
This is garbage. Sure ain't country. TSWRA.
Parece que estavam com preguiça quando filmaram este clipe.  É a mesma cena repetida várias vezes. O figurino dela também deixa a desejar. Faltou coragem , vontade,  criatividade, falta tudo. A música é boa mas o clipe nota 0.
Why does she have to make country music nakes as well......
Texas prison for you honey would be more appropriate title

I love this so much more then the original ❤😮you did an amazing job truly
Monstro
Why do some people they can do ANYTHING?? Stay in your line. This ain’t working. I can hear “Say My Name Say My Name..” the whole song. This is not country.
Trash ass
This is garbage. This is not country. fake ass commercial music garbage at its finest trying to make money
Culture appropriation at its finest 👌 😂🤭 good for her for dipping her toes, but it's just not country.
Evil
Why don't you wear more clothes and why are you trying to muscle in on the VW scene? Are you mocking it? This song sucks btw.
27.4 m folllowers. Yeah right
Not a Beyonce fan and wondering why she gotta have her breasts exposed and looks like she is wearing pantyhose.  Huh?????
Horrible, everything about this sucks. Cheap cheap cheap. This song is Horrible. Totally not concert. She trying way to hard !!
Where did this song go?
Why do everyone say this is country IT ISNT COUNTRY YALL
Her hand as a gun lol
Nope
Couldn't get past first 30 seconds, sorry but this is garbage

A vulgar old woman!
This song is dogwater. No wonder she was 'snubbed'.

Queen
What an extreme amount of effort must have been put into this video..
I don’t like it
who is there after the puff daddy affair ?
SHE KNOWS!
SUCKS.😢
This video does not fit the song
Franklin the turtle did it first
What’s’ next? Garth Brooks doing rap?! What the hell is this? Slick marketing won’t work.
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over?  Says the man who works 9 to 5 but got time to judge someone ultimately smarter than them.
I don't believe all celebrities now. Yukkkk!
My momma don't wash my ass no more.
Not country
I hate.to say that it's pretty good.
Garbage.
Another dumb Beyonce country song
First time seeing a country singer naked in a video.  And Beyonce expect the country music community to respect you!!!
Aaliyah, miss u
🤮🤮🤮
👏🏼 ja so geht das
Never heard such unseasoned country singing. So fkin BORING.
Beyonce is a criminal miss you queen aaliyah 😢😢
Meg insists you put on a sweater RIGHT NOW! YOUR TATAS are overexposed. Cant go to RED LOBSTER dressed like THAT!!! YOU & JAYZ SHOULD OPEN UP CASINOs in texas only and give Vegas a run for their money!!!
The fuck is this shit.
You are Aliyah's parasite 😂
Every grammy award why others scared with her anda mentioned her ya 😅
?? I liked the song before watching this video - song is good without that
I love to listen to country but this is absolutely NOT country! Btw this is just my opinion
She didn't have enough money for the upper part of the dress.
I wonder why shes been called the queen? Like wheres the queen vibes
You death beyoncé
I want comment is it safe for my life ?
8. Please search Quran with English translation .Say: he is Allah the one
❤Beyoncé
Beyoncé, what did you do? I loved if you like it put a ring on it,
She knows.... how to make money and good music
Hahahahaha
She knows....
Song is horrible
Beyonce is the only one responsible for everything. The year is 2024. She is threatening everyone to make them praise her.
You’ll never be bigger than king MJ
Child abuser just like P Diddy
Queen Beyonce and her husband King Jayz we love them ❤️ ❤
She knows.

What did you do with diddy and Jay Z?

when she was talking about a hoe down... clearly she must of tripped!
She is the Levi's queen.
she knows
She is a killer
For me this video is repulsive. I can't understand why so tallented woman is showing her naked body all the time. She doesn't have to prove anything to anyone.  What an example she sets for her daughters and other young girls ?
Weet chèeks. Wow damn the clouds. Catnip. Bacon frazzles? Nah who? Me. Tango and lilt please. Umbungo now
Stupid video. Not a bad song. But she isn’t country. Can’t blame her tho, she’s getting older and trying so hard to stay relevant.
There's a huskiness  in Ella Henderson's voice that like an extra instrument ❤
Stick to what you know!
todella epäonnistunut video. surkean oksettava
Me gusta los videos de beiyonce. Pero me hubiese encantado ese video mas diversificado!   Ella tiene con que, y mucho mássss 😊 ❤🎉!!!!
Went cheap on it xD
She has no voice.

SHE KNOWS…
She and her husband are going down with P. Diddy. So sad that these people have sold their souls.
You are the best!
Very sad, people hurting, being taking advantage of, then giving the same back.
Lmao naw
Is she a cyborg
Cremin Mission
P diddy
I love this guy!!! His voice is amazing!!! Gives me a chill 😊
A generic song go back to what you do best
Please for the lovenof god let her never sing another song deemed country.
Nice song Beyonsa
This is terrible
Song sucks
Song sucks
The video sucks,she's doing the same thing over and over it's so boring!!

É decepcionante saber que há muitas pessoas ainda a apoiando, mesmo sabendo que ela é cúmplice dos atos nojentos do maridão,ela pode ter sido vitima no começo mas chegou em um momento que se tornou igual a ele,ela mesmo disse ele criou ela,aprendeu tudo com ele,estão conectados espero que caiam no fundo do poço jay z e beyonce Espero que não ajam mais vitimas😢Agora se ela for totalmente inocente eu a apoiarei,mas a essa altura não tem como.....
Texas cowgirls don’t dress like call girls. I think the song sux. Just because you call out our state doesn’t make it country.

Heard this in the corner store. Irony. Slip it in the panitierre. Pantaloons yeh. Sweethearts and shotguns. Sweet dagger in the boots. Swizzle sticks and sherbet saucers. Wafer yummies. Hair up or down? Which is more sexy? Either, eh. Who cares? Just waddle over. Give the jelly a jiggle. Icecream sundae with sprinkles and cream. Raspberry ripple.
❤️❤️
how is this country?
They may have snubbed her but Beyonce proved her point. Go on Girl! Keep on creating your music!!!
That looks in the mirror speaks volumes...
100% Texan here, I love this song!
This isn't country music 😂😂

Not really country to me
Why she is half nude and not in a Cowboy dress? 🤔

❤ Bey is truly versatile. Many people don't realize that most people from the south grew up with country music influence.
I just became a Beyonce fan. Go get it, girl!
Not country

This is NOT country!!
She made a FULL, official video for this song, and it has a fraction of the views as 10 seconds in a leather vest. Only Beyonce.
Country amazing 👏👏👏
Ödül vermek lazım.
Bro it’s so sad that she didn’t get one of the best country albums like she deserved it
She look like a granny & she's naked 😂😂this video must have PG

A 'country' song - really?...
I hate this song
I Don`t mind , people they are still here
That's one reason why she didn't get a music award. Most country people don't dress like they're better than everybody and look like a w****
This aint country
Put some clothes on Beyoncé. Country music did not nominate you because they do not want to be represented by people who feel they need to dress like this to get a nomination.

MAN
Hi I'm one of Riley's new emotions.
I appreciate the discipline and longevity through realistic high standards that have been long gone. #character
Yea she needs to hop off this genre she needs to stick with hip hop.
Wtf is this video????
This Sucks!!!!!
Me not knowing beyonce before: Me also vibing with this song:
Quite VULGAR! Girl bye!!!
Großartiger Song! Und dazu ein wahnsinnig armseliges, beknacktes, lanwgeiliges Video, wie schade.
This is a good song
Horrible on All levels.  And why is she half naked?
Yaaaays BEYONCE MAGA VOTING TRUMP 2024
Lauretta Fork
Garbage
This is the stupidest video
This is why you don't get nominated for CMA Awards looking like a sled on stage
Not country period !!!
I like the song but that’s the stupidest most boring video. Sorry woman.
was ist das für ein scheiss "Video"?!

Is this a joke?
The most garbage country song ever. She needs to stick to her genre because country isn't it
Thank you. Genius.
Best cleavage in the business.
Does she have nipples?
She is horrible.
Wonder if this has a hidden  meaning
Beautiful song I love your music.I hope you are coming out for the Vice President soon.We wanna see you come out on national t.V.We love you
Doesn’t sound country I’m just saying
MUSIQUE NRJ MERCI BEAUCOUP  TOM 😂😂😂😂😂

Why does she have no shirt and by the way my Teacher put it by accident and all the boys had to cover their eyes 👀 😅
U should know that
Sorry B but unfortunately This is Texas and we aren’t cowboys
This is NOT GOOD!!!!! What an insult to country music🤯🤮😡
I'm from no were fuck town arkansas and I'm tired of hearing every tik tok girl thank she country after hearing this song. Them pointy boot ain't good for shit and no body weres them, white people got one thing country music and raceism. Stop trying to take it you can take the Wana be rapers but stop trying to be "country " it's fucking stupid
That’s not country, more Pop.
A sl&tt singing country music! Glad they are not as fucked up as her!
Why oh why do female singers think they need to sex it up to be successful. If you're a good singer, you are -- without the pole stripper outfit. Respect yourself.
This is NOT COUNTRY, this is Pop. No more Beyonce.🤡
Wow these lyrics are unbelievably stupid, and don't get me started on the video....
Żenujące...chyba dopiero co zrobione 😂😂😂😂
The album sucks.  To the left.  Don't you EVER get to thinking you're irreplaceable.
This is not country we grew up listening and watching everything country because of my mother believe me she knew country and this is not it, if she had gone with a different video performance probably would have been nominated what is the point of this video the song yes her singing yes the video performance no    Her performance with Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl and the people involved  setting all that up was excellent   Charley Pride he is country
What about the Kids seeing an old granny like this???
Moin !  Ja gutes Lied ! Nur frag ich mich warum das Video dazu so langweilig ist da hätte man nun doch was besseres erwartet !?
Not much left to the imagination but not complaining.Love this track.
Come scrub my kitchen floor beyonce

What is happening. She’s pigging up the genre. No. Beyoncé no. She’s trash.
This isn't country music, yuk
That's why this song is so popular! She's practically naked. The song in itself is not good. I've heard better.
Bad in a bad way.
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
She has my VOTE!
Just one man's opinion, but this Boston/NYC/L.A. boy says this isn't really country. But don't get upset. I don't think there has been any real country played for quite a while. For 30 years what is played is called Country/Pop. It is not my cup of tea really. It all sounds the same...no unique individual personality. So Beyonce's attempt at crossover is not important unless she went way back to bring the Carters and Ralph Stanley back. But I love the singer in general.
Can't even comment on this trash
J❤
Wow... Thought this was a joke.  Complete garbage lol.
Were we going for the stupidest video of all time there Bey? If so .... Nailed it.
It’s a good song, but definitely not the best of 2024!
Labadie Stream
Most uninteresting music video I've ever watched. Redundant and boring.

If she was a trumper all you in breds would be all over this. It's more country sounding than jason Morgan and Luke and she's from Texas and grew up at the rodeo, Jason grew up rich white boy
What’s with the get-up ?   I never liked your movie , I think Rihanna and Taylor Swift have more talent
Before I say anything else…. I like Beyoncé okay….. but this song sounds like AI was asked to compose a country song with a black woman’s voice.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN...
cant tell what was annoying the song or the video on replay
Hello Hola omg
2024 CMA Awards: Beyoncé's acclaimed 'Cowboy Carter' snubbed with zero nominations. The album sat atop Billboard’s Country Music Chart for four weeks, and the album’s lead single “Texas Hold ‘Em” held the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs list for 10 weeks
Nasty
This woman is vulgar. This is garbage masquerading as singing.

This is rubbish
No wonder she wasn't nominated with this crap and her 'appearance'  Jeeze.  Where's  Dolly, Loretta,. Barbara, Patsy,  EmmyLou, Carrie,  Patty, Crystal, Lynn, Reba  and so on and so on.??
Shittyvideoclip
This is so stupid showing the same thing over and over, and it's nasty with her boobs practically falling out for everybody to see. She is not country, never has been country, and never will be country. Stick to your hip hop or pop music Beyonce and leave the country music to the country artists, which you are not one of.
Oh please! Tuck those things away! Aren’t you somebody’s mother!? Nasty!
Can't let my kids watch that😜
Ewww. Terrible country video
THAT IS NOT COUNTRY.
If that's country, well then country sucks, but it aint country at all nothing but terrible non-country music, just saying. Really bad
I think it’s ridiculous and Hoochie mama for country!!  Country music usually has Little less pornish look to it
Cma Eat Asss
This video is boring, though, and has nothing to do with the lyrics

Tooooo.....this aint how down achoooo
Ooo this song sucks I was expecting better from Beyoncé 😬
Not country
Country music made by someone that never heard a country song but heard stereotypes about it
Weird video. Good song. I don't feel the country vibe.
Beyonce + country = GUARANTEED  PERVERSION 👎   👎
NOT country...pg/R rated porn!  If you have to show 3/4 of your breast...
Shame on you Country Music Award for snubbing Beyonce!
Tanya s where u at ❤️😭🫂
Maybe she could put some damn clothes on first??
Wtf is this bullshit
This isnt country music What trash Disgusting
I will never understand why women think that if they take off their clothes or walk around half naked they will be more respected or get more recognition. A sweater sometimes achieves more.
She needs more clothes..
Der song gefällt mir, muss gleich tanzen. Aber die kleidung finde ich sehr schlimm. Hat sie das wirklich nötig?
Kkkk
Eita.   Sem comentários
Remember when Beyonce sang 'Nasty ' put some clothes on in the 90s.  What happened?
🦋👉🔥🔥🔥
Hi 💚😬😉☺️
Tolles Lied, aber aber warum tritt sie nicht gleich nackt auf? Bei so einer Stimme und Karriere hat sie so einen peinliches Video 😖 doch nicht nötig, oder?
Go girl 🎉
If this is the official video. What the elll is wrong with us! This is disturbingly disturbing 😊😂

I'd rather say she doesn't have any shame anymore not that trust in the jacket. What is a hooker in the streets? Why is she presenting herself like that? The motto is more fame no shame
Nope
First I have to say I love many Beyoncé and destiny’s child music. This is not country nor is it something I expect from Beyoncé. I didn’t like it at all

Illuminati crap trying to knock Lainey Wilson off the top of the charts. It's so obvious what's going on here. Good tune but sucky video, message, and intention. Definitely not something you'd want to influence your kids. Boo!

Iove is ❤❤❤❤
And to believe the recent hatred of Cowboy Carter is coming from people thinking she is trying to culture vulture the country genre 🤦🏿‍♂️ This woman is from Texas for God sake! She had country elements on multiple projects in the past but she now is at the level of not being forced into a certain genre. She's done pop, jazz, hip-hop, trap, Broadway, but no one is complaining but the country genre. Her latest album reached a new audience for country, why complain?
Looking good Miss B.  u always been welcome..  work it out sister it so hot!

Horrible
She one sexy mofo
The hand gun straight up that’s what’s up ❤
Great song; didn’t like the video. Could have been way more fun dancing (great opportunity to mix styles) and way way less sexy poster posing.

❤❤❤
Das Video ist langweilig.
Not usually a Beyoncé fan but this is a gem.
What's funny is #1 song is based on play time. Her husband paid to have it played so is it bcuz of that? Or the ACTUAL popularity of the song? Sorry it's not a bad song but country? No it's not.
This sucks
wooh!!!
It's a shame Jay Z prefers young boys instead of that firm, tight body.
Such a lazy music video
This song sucks
Not the most creative video from Beyonce😅
Body😊
❤❤❤❤
A Bar Song (Tipsy) by Shaboozey are far better country music than this. Let’s just talk real here.
❤
I think this song is great! It's definitely catchy.😊
Stronger.
Trash 🗑
Why would anyone like this song, video or much less the want-a-be country musician?
La musique est incroyable mais le clip y'a pas d'effort ç est une musique de cowboys !
👏👏👏👏👏
💜💪💜
Thank you very much for sharing your music during this” time.”   I am at a loss of word .. I didn’t want to believe this.  Kind Regards,  Nichole S ( location GA 😁🐴🤫) ha

I love Beyoncé
I love beyonce
Shyt sounds so damn stupid.  Doesn't sound country at all
Betty learned to ride the bicycle late. Betty fell off a few times and hates riding bikes. Betty had her bike stolen. Betty's bike. Just a bike. Betty's car inherited but Betty owns the car and Jiminy cricket he drives in it. Car just a car, bike just a bike, food just food. Swimming just swimming. Buttons with marshmallow next?!
Country music sucks even more now.
❤❤❤❤❤
Why she not wearing bra
Great song. Horrible video.
This not remotley country
Sounds more hip hop to me.
6 months after  I always have goosebumps when Ilisten this song...I feel like a kid woo hoooo
She loves Beyoncé
My mom loves this song  you  make another one
Eu amo
No lyrics + no music = no clothes
I love your song Beyonce heart❤
Ridiculous video. Don't get me wrong, I like the song. But seriously.....the video.....nope.... doesn't do it for me at all....which is disappointing.
BEYONCE is a good singer,  but Stephanie Quayle is 1000% better
Gotta be the worst song ever in the past 10/20 years what an absolute piece of trash 🗑️ 🤢🤢🤢
Brilliant!!  This is more political than most will ever comprehend... 1 step to the right... Rum me to the left, spin in the middle....
Beyonce gonna end up madonna!!!😬👀
Wait how did they get out?!? I need to know wtf?!?
Ong there are so many simps in the comments shes grown so much the video is great, the video is a joke her doing the same things over again 😂 she used to do amazing music videos but this you can see she put no effort in to it......she said this was the perfect country song yet theres no country dance in the video well theres nothing really country in the video just her so narcissistic 😂😂
Focus the lens on the lingerie though yeh. Bugs eyes. Runner road had a feel. Organised sometimes. Nah tooties.
Sexy
This song sucks
❤
No me canso de oír esta canción,  es PRECIOSA!!!VAMOSSS!!!QUE VOZ MÁS BONITA!!!ERES UNA  REINA!!!BEYONCÉ!!!VAMOSSS 👍👌👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪❤️💛❤️🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🎖🥇🎼🎵🎶👣👣👣👣⌛️⏳️🌍🌎🌏🤍💙🩵➕️➕️➕️💖💖💖🫂🫂🫂🫂
So Stupid!!
I thought this was AI. Well she had her  girls done😂
I thought I'd be disappointed by Beyonce doing country, but I'm glad she actually uses classic country instruments (banjo etc.) in this song when a lot of today's country songs just have a guitar!
🎉🤠🫵🎬💙🫡👏👏👏👏🤩🐎
🫵😎🤠🤠🎤😉👍🤩🤩🤩🐎🤩🤩🤩🎬🫡🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💙
🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
Talent is talent. Loretta Lynn managed to become a rock star and now Beyoncé is a country star. Well done!
La chanson ok mais le clip??? 😢
All I can think is put some clothes on why are you naked this is ridiculous stop trying to be sexual play a freaking song
Fake country song👎
The closest thing well get to the visuals 😂
Goddess should be with me
Wow sexyist ever 😊
❤
Would have been sexier in a cowboy get up sexy style not this weird crap. Hot people don’t need costumes.
Uhu beyconé TEXAS HOLD 'em 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Devil Incarnated
Bad veido
زبال
I needed to decide how I actually felt about this song so I listened just this once in it's entirety.  I will never choose to listen to it again.
Had Aaliyah killed over jealousy lmao. sad
Terrible. She really messed up with fake songs like this. You weren’t welcomed into country because your music sucks bad. Not because of your race. That’s why Kane Brown and Darius Rucker are accepted 💀
You forgot to blur somethink 🫣
This ain’t country woooooooo
😂😂😂 Texas es de México ❤❤❤ que no se les olvide
this would be better if Beyonce did more dance moves
Hate from Germany

That's a Badd Joint 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
ONLY 50 M? ISNT THIS THING THE GOAT,ISNT THIS NUMBER ONE ! THINGS THAT MAKE U GO HMMM PAYONCE!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
shaboozey song is better no offence
I prefer to watch the Tik Toks, what kind of video is this?..
This song is so bad 😐
Omg! 😍😍😍😍
God awful
Definitely not a fan. But as trump says " thats why they have menus in restaurants". To everyone who does find this enjoyable, Yeee Haww!
Port ship
Clip nul dommage avec une chanson qui évoque les États-Unis faire un clip comme ça c'est honteux
Hi
yes she's hot but she literally does nothing in this video except stand there and point her hand.  i'm having trouble finding where the massive talent is supposed to be
Well I mean she born and raised in Texas.❤
She has grown soo much I am soo proud of her!
@jayz gratitude @jlo thank you
@Sandra Bullock
@kamala harris
Putt on some clothes 😮😮😮😮
This is NOT A COUNTRY SONG. It’s also VULGAR!
On a danser ta musique pour la kermesse
Tu chante trop bien
❤❤❤❤👍👍
Visto ieri sera su Rai uno ❤😂😂😂sempre bello😂😂😂😂stupendo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉grande attrice di tantissimi film
This is the most crap you see in America
What boring stuff really? Bryonce messing country with that outfit up . Now i get why the criticsm. Sorry this sucks 😂
This ain't Texas but this is Queen B ..She gone country.  https://youtu.be/RQ_bphrJVy8
This video inappropriate
With Beyonce's money and connections I would have expected a better video. This is something a high school student could have come up with in the last 30 seconds before it was due!
Das Video ist ja wohl echt billig 😂😂
😮
Should stay where she is and leave country music alone come over to the other side and ruin it
Interesting, how no one is mentioning this "video" basically being striptease. "Music" lol
BLUE, if your reading 📖 This. Your Mother is a Queen 👸 of Queens. The Best music video of all TIME!  And all she did Blow off the Smoking 🚬 Gun. Houston.
Pure disrespect of the country music genre, I'm glad the Opre band her.
What a joke😂😂
Sounds horrendous. Ruined a iconic song by Dolly Parton. Video looks trashy.
50M ❤❤❤
Good song., but video awful
Anyone listening in August?🤠
Ich glaube wir müssen einen Spendenfond einrichten. Beyoncé kann sich kein ordentliches Video mehr leisten 😅... Was soll das sein?
Beyonce killed it ❤🐝🐝🐝🐝
Skank
I love your music
A bar song is even better
Song of the year. Yes or no?
Well official song for Honda to make motorcycles in Texas!
Baby ❤
What a stupid and lazy thing.
This is talentless.
sorprendente la gran produccion, y todo el trabajo de grabar este video. Muchos extras, se nota que invirtieron muchisimo en grabar el video. Mucha creatividad, deben haber estado años en planear un videoclips diferente y especial para la audiencia.
Une belle chanson country ! Mais quelle vidéo, du n'importe quoi ! Je m'attendais à autre chose
I'm a huge fan of country. This is shit and not country
god this sucks lol
Queeeen ❤
Shaboozey's A Bar Song way better
ohhh good music but the Video booorriinnggg!!!!!
Und dafür  bekommt die trulla Millionen.. Wir sind verloren...
<‘❤<‘❤
Fking nonsense
"Visualizer"?! What the fuck is that? What about a music video or nothing? And why is she half-naked? What does it have to do with country music? =__=
Only Beyoncé  still undressing loool
Looking good! Go Beyoncé!!!!
❤🎉moto bella
If kids were watching this
This song should be in the next RDR game or in GTA 6
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now surpassed 500 million Spotify streams! Keep streaming and buying! 👑🐝
One of my favorite songs  love it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mi tía dijo que Beyonce es pecadora. Yo le dije que con esos pechos, ella puede pecar todo lo que ella quiera❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love this Song 💙
The song sucks but she looks great on repeat
She can no do country she need to stick with pop
This song is booty this is the worst “country” song I’ve ever heard why do people listen to this bull
😂😂😂😂
What in the ever love of Santa Clause is this shit?   My ears are bleeding.
It's not country music .it's an insult to country singers real country singers.  A banjo don't make it country  .I respect all music but not calling I what it's not .
H❤❤❤ooxdp ৭p৳😅😅😅😊😅😅😮
Right HERES WHAT I'm going to do is I know quite a few people in this town, let's see of they know you Lyft.
This anit sexist
Worse song  don't do you any justice nasty
🥺🥺
Ela é linda,amei a música só achei que ela faria uma puta coreografia faltou isso. Essa mulher dança muito.

WTF?😁
H😊 🎉😋
Let's all start our day by enjoying one of the best country songs ever written! Yeehaw!
This may be the worst music video ever made. Kanye would even agree with this statement. But better country song than any Swift song
Beyoncé gets so much hate for making a country song that’s an actual banger. But not many country folk have a Lexus haha that always gets me
Favorite song ever ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bin nur hier, weil ich auch mal scheiß Baustellenmusik hören wollte
Have a bad eternity in hell beyonce. 💩
👍👍👍
ameiiiiiii uiuiui auuuuuuuuuuu lobo lobo
Is My New Freestyle to Beyoncé’s song Beautiful Liar Good??
Was this the greatest video of all time Kanye spoke of??
Terrible
YOU'RE NOT JELLY ROLL, STOP IT!!
This is really annoying but also really catchy please help like I hate it but I keep on listening to it- 😭💀
stupid video
Worst song in history.  I am happy the hype died down fast cause it was so annoying to constantly hear it at the radio.
Hello ! What s name please or tuto ? Thank s ❤
Showing half body still lost to a bar song 🗿
❤❤
Idc about the haters like the ones who think shes can’t do a country album I don’t know or the racist people who don’t think she’s allowed to do she’s not doing anything wrong not breaking any laws she’s just singing if you don’t like it just don’t listen it’s better than saying all this negative shit and that’s what people are doing
You're with Jay-z, he's a biblical one. You showed off too much tits in that video.
OK, the fact that you have no shirt on that’s like inappropriate for kids if they watch this and I like your song so yeah
why does it sound so boring
The cheapest production for a video ever.
NASTY ...PUT SOME DAMN CLOTHES ON .....WE ALL KNOW NO CLASS
why do thery drees like that
She country always 👍👋❤️
Viva Raffaella Carra forever 💚🤍♥️
My friend showed me this and I want to thank you because I was parilized for 13 years and I got up to turn it off

The most horrible video I've seen since single ladies. Well done beyonce you completely lost it.
This sucks.  Poor country music really getting shit by a this. Nice money grab, beyonce.. "Hey I'm famous and got billions of fans and they will like anything I do it sing, ... And I'll show off my physical assets cuz I know it will be worth much less if don't."

Love❤❤❤❤❤
I am listening to Beyonce for the first' time
Who who loves beyoncé❤❤  👇
I'm about to puke🤢🤮
Yasss we waiting for studio versiob
so just in case the songs not good...
Bro I didn’t even know this was by beyoncé I was just listening to it😭
A pop song with some lyrics about Texas and banjo in the background. Is that what makes it a country music song?
Please let us know we
Probably the worst video and song ever. Real trash.
this is NSFW
I love this song😊
May be she used blue jeans, cowgirl clothes and a horse 😂 May like her more Texas is a cowgirl and cowboy conservatives people.
nul nul nul !!!!!!!!!
But it’s weird
Esta canción la bailaron los de Sexto A en el baile de fin de curso 😰
A black woman singing country in 2024 is really embarrassing.
She has more trust in that jacket than anything
YYAAAASSSS Queen!!!!!
Just because she's Beyonce doesn't mean she's better than shaboozey
I love you ❤❤
La canción es una pasadaaaaaa , el vídeo no vale nada , hace falta una mujer vaquera en pelotas con sus botas y su sombrero vaquero totalmente salvaje , uffffffff
My mam is absent with this song
❤❤❤❤
Music - 10 out of 10! Video - garbage!
It’s strange to think about how a few years from now this will be really nostalgic.
Could have been a great video.
Beyoncè as Lady Gaga.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
oh là là
Sabozy a bar song (tipsy) is better who agrees  👇
The song is bad but coupled with the video I'm like..I can't cringe harder. Why did I fucking watch this
There is just something seriously wrong with this .... I HATE this so much I wish I never saw this
❤
Is this the real video?
Pro active olive j z 🤠🤠😸😸✍️👣👣💙💦🗽📍
It’s like a pantomime of a “southern song” almost insulting. The dude shabiozey, he tapped into the true singer songwriter vibes though
Dunno why everyone calls this country when it sounds exactly like indie rock
One of the worst songs i have ever heard
This song is a$$
George strait turn down a 5 million offer

Not literally everyone praying for a wardrobe malfunction 😛
Country song) What an insult
I like the song but this video sucks. I like the guys in the cowboy hats dancing to the song. Who thought this up? Stupid....
i thought this shit couldnt get any worse and then i realized they didnt even try with the fucking video either
Devil worshiping fraud. Next
I love how popular she is. Everyone loves her.
She deserves all the love, views, and likes she's getting.
There are zero criticisms here and I'm here for it!
No one can change my mind!
I loved this!
Awesome country song!
One of the best country songs of all times!

This song is so cringe
Deadass, "A Bar Song" by Shaboozey sounds more country than whatever the hell this is😂
Ass
The song is good,  As a 42 year old Mother of 3, She doesnt need to dress like  Lady gaga to sell it. Her TALENT IS ENOUGH.
More pop music than anything
This is amazing! Love this song! One of the best songs I've heard honestly and it really fits her so perfectly. She can sing anything and it'll be amazing! She is also one of the greatest country singers out there. I'd love for her to put out more country music. We should get this to 1 billion views.
So ne tolle Frau !!!
❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
this is not real country!!! thats wack pop parody of real COWBOY country....
🎉😂❤❤❤❤❤😂🎉
Fuck 🎉 Witherspoon me nooooo🎉❤

Love this beautiful song priceless ❤❤❤
She killed it! Love this!
Pathetic
Queen
Lots of mixed reactions re this video. I heard the song & thought it was fun, so I thought I'd give the video a try. Now I like the song much less. What's with this video? Boring, random, the vest? It's kinda cheap & tacky.  We get it! You got boobs! Congrats
W Video  L Song
Kids
This sounds like a remix of Send My Love To Your New Lover
This kind of sh*t is what causes posers to think and get involved in all things country. All this started around 2018 when artists crossed over and brought their disgusting fan base posing like they’re country oriented such a shame how country has gone downhill…
😂😂 hanno risparmiato sul video 😅
The best song ❤️ i listen this song everyday. After freedom.
Hi votce  t nt  parents
https://youtu.be/hlJCMogM4VY?si=YIQ2Sc2j989_kam2
Nothing more fake then a wannabe hillbilly songs terrible too wtf ???
Ain't nothin more country than a Lexus
When Beyonce wants to party you gots to cut her a paycheck...Matt Williams
Sorry tru I was at hom  I just sit
Beyoncé is an amazing artist but this is not her lane. Horrible song and this video is even worse.
I feel i watch a porn 😅 lol good song but where the texas and the dance 😅??
Ewww she is looking so unwanted 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢

What is the point in this music video worst music video in the world
i think she copies that tune from a different song, can't put my finger on it but it does sound like a copy cat song
++++
I just learned what texas hold on means. Actually I don't bet 😮.
Double sided tape
I love your music
I love you Beyoncé 🌹🌝
#theroaringkitty #gme
Good song crap video
Queen B - Good song and short vid a lot of pleasure⚡🇺🇲🕶️🎶⛵🎸🎶🎵🇨🇩😻😋
Apocalipsis...?
Shittest song ever.
Beyonce. My little granddaughter loves you. Whoo. Bout time.
What is a Texan hold on? Ok I got it. Rondesantis. Wake me up. Florida.. Uh Oh Texas. Explain 😮😮😮
Why is she showing off her breast!!! This was really unnecessary she ruined the song
No more floods in Houston Texas amen❤
Down down down dooownnn
Lame porn fingers video
Is it just me or am i the only 1 loving this video .
What a great example to young ladies she is!
There's nothing country being naked ... We raise our children different.  KEEP THE WORLD OUT 👍
This song is really good I liked it but I didn't know it was Beyonce till now
In België is dit hier precies soms Texas😂😂😂😂😂🎉😢😅😢
I love you song it's so cool❤❤❤❤
Don’t like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😤😂😂
I hate this song so much
جم تیوی کشورت به گفته اردوقان به دلیل توریستهای ایرانی تا پنجاه درصدش از ورشکستگی نجات یافت چطوری مسخره کردی فکر من و حمام ترکی باشه کشور ترکیه پاک پاک بدون هیچ ....و جهان ...... کارمند جنسی یا ماساژ خیلی پستین. مرسی طرفداری از جنبش کور کردن چشم شهروندان یک قطعه از سیاره

Me gustó mucho la canción, pero este video muy repetitivamente aburrido! Tan lindas coreografías y ver esto…
What a dumb song 😂
Nog trying to sing country 😂
I never heard a country song like Beyonce you are actually one of the best if not the best
Great son definitely wish she coverrd up though
She put as much effort in this "country" song as her video production
Encore à Poil 🤦🤦🤦
lol
Ruined the franklin theme song
Hola. Appropriation Disgusting.Dr White European scholar.Rule and dumb vide.Money.Like your voice.BUT you do not speak my tongue.European Scholar
This "video" is for real? So lame
When trying to fit a country audience. My advice is not to come out looking like a cat house madame.  you don't seem to respect yourself very much. You are one of the most talented singers ever, you don't have to share your sex habits every time you sing a song now.
perfection
Freaking LOVE this song 🎶 ❤❤❤
That is so inaprspiet
Where is the live version? 😮 No qualitativ live version from the renaissance World tour. 😢
nothing makes sense in this cool song but nothing makes sense at all
The song of the year!!!!!
IMO - A conplete scam. This song in no way a hit. IMO  Cash Box or some other label  possibly inflated its numbers to push it to number 1 when it belonged at the top 200.
Love her but the video doesn't match the song. Kind of repulsive. Glad to see her show the good stuff about Texas. MUSIC AND DANCE.
Antoniogrdo
What TF is even this? Bro.
She's not even dancing she's just standing there😅
What the fuck did I just watch and listen too 😢😢😮
i’m just loving it so much
my bbygal loves this song superhappy we love it <3
No Shaboozey
Only dipped in 1 chip. Girl is white now 😢
Country? 😂
Love this song, don;t quite get the video but ok. I would have loved to have seen her do some cool two stepping instead of sexy walking, lol.
Garbage Song.. Learn some Class before you Whore your way into a better genre
You would think that after this long in her career she would not have to be a tramp
That it come on beyonce shake ur ass or something 🤦‍♀️
This is the worst song in history ..... .. i would die before hearing this ever again

I love Beyoncé!!!! Hello, I' from Brazil.
That is the stupidest video ever.  That’s so annoying seeing her do the same thing over and over and over again.  I expected more from Beyoncé.  😡
This song is dog ass
Why does she have to be basically naked to do this video? Isn’t she too old for that like I can hear a song without looking at naked women right?
Deine Worte sprechen mir aus der seele❤ danke 😢
Attention is drawn on breasts and legs, not the video
That vest looks like it is from Klaus Schwab new collection.
Evil does Evil. The part of this song is the girls next door played it non stop on one of the floor karaoke machines. It vibrated my place so much, I couldn't stop hearing it....3 illegals gonna be famous. Yeah. Someone needs to break it to them. But, I had to listen to it and feel vibration non stop. 🤮
I ain't feelin' this. #SorryNotSorry 😚
Stupid video-welcome to the futuristic nigntmare terminator style.🤮
Cover up please 😂
Pure art ❤
I will call police
It's not the official video
Look at her clothes very bad clothes change it ie not good
I love your boops
Beyonce is peng, who knew?!
When are you making minigames
Thats not country music.

This is terrible!
I love this song

Ela cansou de mudar de figurinos e de dançar 😂😂😂😂
Definitely ain't Texas, its just depressing. She should just stick to what she knows 🗑️
I wonder how many times her vest showed her chest 2:12
Would you jack of to he outfit 🤔 (btw this is a joke question)
Amoo❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Dafuq did I just watch and here
How the fuck is this country
can anyone here tell me what this song is supposed to be about?
❤❤❤❤❤❤
What's with the porn?
QUEEN "B"  Owned this!!! Love your majesty!!! You ARE an AMERICAN TREASURE!!!
This Song deserves the SOTY
Inquietante come ingresso di spettacolo,ha forse venduto l'anima al diavolo?
This song sucks👎 definitely not country
Visuals could of been better and pertaining to the song. She’s talented there’s no need to have her naked to sell the song
Kids bop  doesn't have  cursing  so kids bop better then Beyonce
Love us our 1 children chairs left in our musical chairs love us 666😈😈😈
I don’t like this
What you get when you cross sorta-country with sorta-porn?
Shes a horrible role model half naked only way to get attention
No spoko wsadziłby no ale co poza tym ?!
This is the worst song I have ever heard
Poor girl... as more reach become, as less clothes she is  weaing.
Good Song  very Bad Video

המלכה שלי לנצח!❤
What a bunch of total crap  Should be ashame to listen to this piece shit
This ain’t country music 😂 .. smh
I said she should do a song with Darius Rucker😊
There's a tornado in my city get to the basement that s*** ain't pretty😊
I love Beyoncé and the song’s  cool and fun.   But what’s up with overly simplistic looped  Video ?   Hmmm, can’t say she’s a starving new artist. I wonder why she chose to represent that way.   Possibly starting a trend? ‘unplugged’ minimalist version of a video?
I never heard such a boring and terrible Song from Beyonce, absolutely Garbage. When this song is.playing in Radio i turn it off
I miss when music was more about music and not showing skin. Music video's can be super original and fun without showing any skin
i hate this song fnaf songs are way better than
Great song, very bad outfit. Looking like  a hooker with implants. Now the teenager-girls will think it’s OK to go out like that.
Hey this man has two tumours on his chest
You should’ve stuck with your oldies! The classics were so much better! Why country?
trump 2024
I went to Texas and is so beautiful
You don’t need ya boobies hanging out lass do you and maybe a bit heavy don’t normally like ya music but I do like that one how about a shirt and jeans just a thought
🎉

Sorry, Beyounce. You are not and cannot be country. You can bully your way into town but you are not and cannot be country. Sorry old chick. Stay if you want but you aren't real.
Comi ela conseguia repetir o mesmo passe sem errar? ELa é perfeita.
💩🗑️💩🗑️💩🗑️
True question: what’s the point of a visualizer?
Iluminati!!!!

Stupidest video EVER!!
This is not country
Beyoncé?  Country? LOL... You can put your boots in the oven, but it don't make 'em biscuits...
Its true i checked the actual music video
Why did you strew me.on fourth you got pregnant and later had miscarriage?
There’s so much opportunity for a good video but this is pure laziness
Beyoncé i love you you my family
It’s the Spotify reel . Not a music video yet
What the hell is even that, lawd  Nooooooooooooooooooooo

This is an insult to country music🙄
Seriously, this is talent????????
Happy 4th of July America! let's celebrate with this All-American song!
Jfc this song is STRAIGHT ASS
This video is whack..  it’s just my opinion, no one has to agree with me 😂
Trash
This song needs to be erased from history
Pretty sure the video is a little lacking because its a real country song and real country doesnt have music videos
❤super Beyoncé❤
Get naked to sell tickets What is the difference then between “ artists “ and prostitutes then Just curious
why is their no (real) music video for this. same with her previous hit with "break my soul" just a visual
June 2024
Skickar richard
Your ,  this.  Is hers. Practice make real skills.
Such a TERRIBLE song! My goodness! It is horrible beyond belief. What has happened to our art?
I guess the filming didn't take long.

I just at turned on to her video,music 16 carriages ,at 75 yrs young Remember music an memory
Participando esperaba el baile de acordé al género lo que presenta es la belleza de su cuerpo y deja mucho que desear en cuanto al tema principal del género que canta me desilusionó y no es que le tenga envidia pero debería ser más artista de calidad
The single most over-rated "performer" ever.
Une bonne musique country!! J'adore!  de supères chorées à créer sur ce rythme !

All she's doing is advertising her body, there's nothing country about the video
La meilleure
This is the most restarted costume I have ever seen, nothing to do with country, and the song sucks big time, sorry you do not belong in country
thumbs down
Bold and Honest Sentuallity ❤ I LOVED IT ❤revisted  July 1 2024 ❤  thanks BEYONCE❤❤❤❤❤DOBIE WAN KANOBIE ❤❤❤
how is this song called Texas Hold em when its very first lines are ”This ain't Texas, ain't no hold 'em”, this bugs me to no end
Sexy Beyonce just prove Us that walking it's enough 😁
She sounds good doing  country love it  ❤❤❤❤❤
💛❤️🤍💝💖🩶🖤🤎💜❤️🧡
The most talented beautiest sexiest girl alive 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝👑👑👑👑👑🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿
This song is nothing more than a cash grab.
I think Beyonce has the same skin condition Michael Jackson had.
❤
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY KEYS???????????????????????????...LEXUS KEY....ON A MICKEY MOUSE RING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....LOL....MUCH LUV YONSAY......ICON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am not the only one to hit I dislike this!!!!
Whatever's going on Texas or anywhere else, it ain't going down down here.
Budget 5k..mark up millions.
Nah she needs to fold em. Texas NOT IN this video. Smdh... Embarrassing Texas... Nothing about Texas at all. Says more than them wasted lyrics will. Guarantee that video wasn't even made in Texas.
not country booooo.. move on
Tree fiddy was spent on this music video. You don't believe, go and ask that lock Ness monsta
The award for best performance goes to Beyonce's boob tape.
This is GARBAGE!!!!
Awesome!!!
i'm boycotting her at this point. Beyoncé has no integrity ; she married for power and money, keeps an ugly cheating ape by her side because it's easier, makes a stank face when she doesn't get an award like it should be hers to begin with, also willingly stole the spotlight from her *best* childhood friends at every opportunity she got while in Destiny's Child by greediness - thinking she's the only deserving one of the 3 (or 4 if you're old enough) since she was a kid, tramples in other music genres just to prove points... it's petty as hell at this point. i used to love her but now everything about her screams NO
Making songs for the sake of being "trendy" and not putting any commitment afterward. Go back to your single lady days.

You ain’t broke the internet and you STILL HAVE NOT beat TAYLOR SWIFT…that’s what this is all about. Why make a music video doing the same thing???? Who else u gonna pay to stand up and complain when you don’t win another award
Lost your mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWpsOqh8q0M
This song sucks, so many better black country music artists out there. If she put this record out before she was famous, there would have been a totally different outcome
Shes.not.freakin.country Why Is She.tryin To Be.me I Don't Think The  Batch  Can.sing
You realize if you go country, we expect you to give Satan up. Otherwise, you won't do very well. This is a joke.
The song's good but the fact that she's just doing the same thing over and over again is just so annoying which is why I hated the song and then it grew on me but I still hate the fact that she does the same thing over and over again
This hits hard on mute 💨💨💨🔥🔥🔥
I understand the studio musicians were looking for a paycheck, but they should be embarrassed for being associated with this song.
So reversed
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
She sayin this ain't Texas   But the queen done gone back to her roots with this sound.  #HolditdownHtown #QueenB

😵
Aqui é uma nova música? 😃
🤮
YES!
Everybody at the bar getting tipsy is better does anyone agree !!!!!!! 💯 I hate this song please have respect for Texas
Beyonce only needs 10 seconds because she's that hot 🔥!!!!!
Love it. 🐎
Leave it to her to make country suck.. again
Es un canción que pudo tener una historia romántica con mucho contexto y prefirieron degarbos saber que Texas está en crisis interna y que Texas representa la parte mas importante del PIB de EUA y que no podrá separarse tan fácilmente de EUA... Texit? Por qué se polítiza todo?😢
Good tune. But she STILL can't sing.
Beyonce was born in Texas! Love  this song....but....that aint country and western wear! Nor does C & W use cuss words in their music! This could had been an awesome video, wished you could have had the time to have made a video! It would had been awesome to see you in your cowgirl boots and blue jeans with a western shirt! Heck you could start a country & western line of clothing!! I know you could bring it to the table too with class and some unique sparkle! Have a Blessed day Beyonce!
Out of all the people on YouTube that made dance videos to this song waiting for her video to come out this is it? Walking naked and shooting an imaginary gun over and over? I know it's not from lack of knowing how to dance she's a professional dancer I don't get it?
Who else is here in June 2024
I love country music ❤
Texas are tejanos l like their music 🎵
I think she forgot the rest of her outfit.
This is a disgrace to all the country boys. This is not country. 😢
Sweet song and vid..would you consider collaborating with Gretchen Wilson , yall would wreck the world 😘
She got that right..country girls are beautiful.  A little more work and she will have it. Dolly Parton country legend can become rock n roll hall of fame, Beyonce can become a contry singe, maybe even grand ol opry.
This is the dumbest video and song ive ever had the unpleasure of listening to. And i listen to little waynes rock album
Beyonce🔥
Good song, but Beyoncé ain’t feeling the song, thus the video.
Dumbest video ever.
this just sux.  Vulgar.
Hej
SUX! 😂.. And does she think going country will save her from the high crimes and child trafficking? I see she's sporting The Illuminati with her eye covered. SMH!
She wants to slowly infiltrate and contaminate. Contaminate with lewd lyrics and videos. Their ultimate goal is to transform this genre so it no longer resembles what it has been for decades. Just like everything else.
This proves the sell out pop country is crap
Stay out of country please. You're not of their caliber
Stil aint country still pop music.
LOVE 💓💓 THIS SONG 💗😍

Oh my God so you think you're going to reinvent yourself through country can use Dolly Parton to help you that's disgusting and I think you're wack you're trying to pretend like you can go from hip hop and r&b which is where you are at and that's where you successfully became famous you're not country you don't sound country it's not country at all you're just trying to get out of being involved in your husband's bad doings with what he did with foxy Brown and you know what he did with foxy Brown and you're refusing to testify you refusing to have that woman's back when she got abused and black balled out of the industry for no reason at all or maybe just to replace be replaced by you.... You act like you're innocent and all everything that your husband did and that you don't have anything to do with it girl you got everything messed up you didn't try to reign him in you didn't try to get control of your husband and tell him to do the right thing no because he gave you Fame and he gave you everything you got right? And so now you want to diminish Dolly Parton's legendwhile she stands up for you and you're going and helping your husband traffic women and do horrible things to them like what he did to foxy Brown and other women YOU ARE NOT INNOCENT YOU BETTER STOP WITH THE FAKE FACADE IN YOUR HEAD COME CORRECT TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS RIGHT DO THE RIGHT THING THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS AND GO BACK TO WHERE YOU BELONG STAY IN YOUR LANE YOUR RB YOU'RE HIP HOP YOU SHAKE YOUR BOOTY AND SELL YOUR MUSIC THROUGH YOUR BODY GO BACK TO WHERE YOU BELONG STAY IN YOUR LANE COMING FROM MY HOMEGIRL THAT'S SO RELATED TO SO MANY CRIPS YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR LANE BE CORRECT 💯 HONESTLY I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN THINK THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS AND GO INTO COUNTRY AND YOU SOUND LIKE CRAP IN COUNTRY YOU ARE NOT LAINEY WILSON YOU ARE NOT SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE YOU ARE NOT DOLLY PARTON YOU ARE NOT REBA YOU ARE NOT CARRIE YOU ARE NOT COUNTRY YOU'RE USING COUNTRY MUSIC TO GET AWAY FROM THE CHARGES AND THE TESTIMONIES THAT YOU NEED TO DO YOU'RE TRYING TO USE COUNTRY TO PROTECT YOU I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY MUSIC INDUSTRY IS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU THAT MAKES ME SICK TOO IT'LL ALL COME OUT IN THE END   KARMA IS WHAT WILL BECOME YOU   MY MOM ALWAYS SAID WOMEN HAVE TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACK AND TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BUT INSTEAD YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE AND YOU LET YOUR MAN DO HORRIBLE THINGS TO SO MANY WOMEN AND WHAT WHAT DID YOU DO YOU HAD OTHER MUSIC ARTISTS FEMALES BECAUSE YOU WERE BISEXUAL MADE THEM HAVE SEX WITH YOU JUST TO GET A SONG OR WHATEVER    YOU ARE NOT INNOCENT  THE RECEIPTS ARE CLEAR AND EVERYBODY'S READING THE RECEIPTS YOU CAN'T FAKE THE RECEIPTS YOU CAN'T PRETEND LIKE YOU'RE INNOCENT YOU AND YOUR MEN ARE NOT INNOCENT.

I think she is great and this is such a fun song!😂❤
Love ths song n groove it...but l dont like the vdeo clips😂
Is it just the same thing over and over again what's the point🫤
Beyonce was right. This isn't country music, it's Beyonce music.  Country music originated in what is now West Virginia, by people who came to this country as indentured servants and who cut their part of VA off from the rest of the state because they refused to fight in a war being fought for what some southerners thought was their "right" to own slaves. Indentured servants got a taste of that and weren't going to support it.  Sorry to the African-Americans who claim to be the originators of country music, you're wrong. AA's originated rhythm  and blues and there are country songs that have heavy rhythm and blues influence in them, but they are not the whole of country music, nor are they it's origins. You have to look to ballads from the isles of Scotland and Ireland, from whence came most of those indentured servants, to find the beginnings of American country music. You'll have to look into the 1930s, 40s 50s and 60s for true American country music anyway, because it's long gone. The stuff labeled country music now, including this song and Beyonce's take on Dolly Parton's Jolene, are pure pop.
Garage 😢😢😢😢😂😂😂
😮 Silly outfit, silly video...great song
Hah, Hah, the fucking challenge dance that everyone is doing on TikTok is better than this 5 second video that just repeats.

Most disgusting song I have ever heard
C'est ça le clip il est nul 😮
stay in your own lane........
To be fair to you and 😅 what you do t wire you to 😮iy
You suck
Worst video ever! For a crappy piece of music. I didn’t care for Beyoncé before her country stage. Think she just torpedoed her career. And why would any videographer think the same clip over and over was a good idea? Couldn’t think of anything else? Hungover or something?
Sometimes you shouldn't listen to your producers when they think they just made a "masterpiece". It honestly sounds like an AI generated youtube short
super good !
I love this Song!
Not Country
Great song, pants video
My words 😢
My vice my game my bad😢🎉😂❤
Don't forget about H town my destiny child lol Jay z he ok

Nope
Gosh this has to be the worse song I’ve heard, like it’s just a regular trash Beyoncé song with a generic country beat and lyric so it’s so called “country” da freak this crap ain’t country it’s wanna be, dress up country, no wonder why I’ve been seeing this all over on TikTok about how bad this country song is 😹 I only made it to 36 seconds of listing to this horrible video and I couldn’t go any longer. And the way she dress is just ₩h0-.r1,$.-H, demonic and inappropriate especially for YouTube, this is why I only listen to Christian music straight for 7 years L0L ✝️
Muy bien
I like the tune, but what in the 2024 Texas ILLUMINATI is this video? Also, why does my tablet autocorrect ILLUMINATI to capital letters?

I thought my ytb was repeating the same thing over and over again but it is actually what her three-minute (almost four) clip is.
It really really good but why wouldn't she add more then her just walking up?.. but overall how dose she trust that jacket one her 😅 really good I mean it 😊
I l9ve this song so much ❤ my favourite  song
Whats is the titol
Why do all these so called female pop stars frel they have to show the riskay parts of there flesh off.  All generic and dumb ...wake up citizens dont pay to see future rotted flesh.
COVER UP MORE BAR TIPSY IS WAY BETTER
Shes great ❤
Black Voices ❤
mulinida tu casino 😊😊❤❤👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💋💋💋💘💘💘💖💖💓💓💓💕💕💝💝💞💗
Real Texas women don't dress like hoes.
This is pure corporate garbage
Don't like the video. No way. But I like the song....
I really like this. If she covers Mae Mercer and Sonny boy's Careless love. I will lose my ish.
Disgusting outfit, country music has class & style.  This shows it is all about her & her midlife crises.  Nothing better to do but try unexplored avenues.  Try bettering & uplifting lives.    I will will stick with Charley Pride & enjoy his country music.  Wish he were still around.  He had class & style.
does anyone else hear shaun the sheep theme in the whistling part of the song 😁🤪prob just me
Adding an acoustic guitar doesnt make it country. This is trash for sure
Le clip est nul mais on aime le son😂
This is mega dull!
The Song is GREAT, but the Video Clip is Boring.
so annoying song
How does this video relates to country genre? 🤦🏾‍♂️
The fuck is this ???
What a disgrace to country music. Pathetic
Just cause she feels to whatever🙄
THIS SHIT AINT COUNTRY NEITHER ARE YOU SO GO BACK TO YOUR POP SHIT!
Sounds good, looks stupid
Good job 🎉🎉
Not a country song fight me
This is not country
I’m sorry for all of those that I make mad but could she put some dang clothes on? The song is good but the raunchy look is horrible!
Pourquoi être à moitié à poil et le reste en sous vêtements ? J'aime bien la chanson mais le clip n'a rien à voir
Fifty cent sucks grimace
Blacks arw great ... i wouldve been shot if ud been in the 6p's .. taking up for black ppl
Fake country music
Sei piú bella quando sei grossa
Waving my confederate flag! To this!

I think it's good to have the courage to sing a country song , a real catchy tune  ❤
My Hook c.g. Nassau 😂❤
America's unanimous pg pronounced American anthem
Not country. This is soul or pop. This is not country. Post Malone made a better country song.
Big timee❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
So this’s all the video?
Beyonce: Can you improve my boobs for cheap? Cheap guy next door:  Say no more!  😂
Music video is so bad 😮
Wonder what she spent the budget on this time...??????? I mean it was the glove wid single ladies!!!!......so am guessing the eye patch broke the bank!!!!!
She looks great and this song is good... She is back baby🎉🎉🎉
Nice song, boring video.
Who ever likes this song are brainwashed 💩💩💩💩
Trash💩
me and me ninos love this ❤🥰🥰😻
Jolín k manera de entrar en bucle!!!😂 Beyoncé has perdido en creatividad!!!Reinvéntate chica!!!😂
Song ok but don't like half naked video
This is a disgrace to country music. SLEAZY.
I did not know this was her. Looks like she is bringing trashy back to country music…
Xfvvv
Fatal vídeo excelente canción
Was hoping for more video than this anyway she still the queen B
❤
Like song not video
La meilleure ❤
Who the fuck gave her permission to do country?
Je fais une trêve aujourd'hui pour ne pas frapper trop fort. Demain je partage. Au moins 80% des gens ne vont pas comprendre le message. De surcroît ici en France le langage anglophone n'est généralement pas entendu 😅 Be a good girl and shut up😭
Isn't it deliciously ironic how more accepting hip hop/R&B is than country.
❤🎉😂😢😮😅😊
Poor thing she just wasn't making it now she's wanting done made a fool out herself you people who like her art of feel real bad for her
As above so below
😂UNBELIEVABLE. That was disgusting. Go back to your music. Video was embarrassing!
She is famous and do what she likes.xxxxxx
Ile w tym ciele i teledysku jest prawdy. Jo jo nic a nic 😂

In Texas they say no but this ain’t Texas
This ain’t Texas
This is the  life
This is the life
Weird clip shame she isn't dancing😢
The fact that I love her so much I literally asked if I could go swim just to play this on the speaker!      My time  3:24 what about yours?
Today's my 27 year wedding anniversary with my husband.  I'm watching again cause hubby was born at  corpus christi Texas
Also das Video ist misst aber der Song gut
That day the music died!! Worst tune ever.
Bro her whole body is showing
Beyonce be looking hot in the video
You go, Guuurrrrlll!!! 😊😊😊
Anybody still listening in 2024?
Es braucht wirklich nicht viel, und doch eine ganze Menge Sexappeal. Interessant ist, dass Musik und Performance so wundervoll se x harmonieren
The wirdest video clip for one of the best songs
worst song ever created
Don't even come by mine. Off you go. America.
It's your politics.  😮. Girl. I'm on .
WTF?????
Shaboozey defo did better
She had to fall into mediocrity like everyone else who has to go out semi-or showing their miseries to sell and gain an audience.  There are girls of 13 or 15 etc, who watch her videos and her music, please ask her if that's what she wants, she wants to teach like everyone else, so let her restrict her videos.
You can sing anythink love from Türkiye ❤
It's the first time I listen to this music and I love it. 😍❤
Love this song🎶🎶♥️👍
Why is it necessary to show her breasts
The original: This ain't no Mudd Club or C.B.G.B.. I ain't got ...
Vma 2024 beyonce top music 1
😢
one of the most horrible kitch songs ever. and what about those super bad effects and noises?
Why the Fuck she dressed like that? Country isn’t about selling your body and the lyrics are terrible
This is ass
❤
Langweilig fällt der Frau nix mehr ein, denkt wahrscheinlich sie muss nix mehr ordentliches produzieren ist ja so ne mega geile 😂
🎉❤
The nicest pair I have seen for a long time.😅
Ehat foes she mean this aint Texas. Wish she had dressed more  cowgirl like with boots, jeans, cowgirl shirt, and cowgirl hat. I cant imagine ladies showing up at dancehalls wearing what shes wearing on this video.
I love the way she's wearing the lined stocking IN THE FRONT!!! LOVE IT...GAME CHANGER. Wearing mine this way.
Lets all enjoy this song today!❤️
ONLY JUST COME TO SAY...   this is absolute shite of a song.... act up
I  will use this song for the artistica gimnastic national team
Super Beyoncé you are the best🫶👍🫶
I like the song but I was expecting a dance video rather than boobs hanging out...such a shame
I actually like this song so who cares if it plays 100000 times
❤❤❤
If there's one thing Beyonce was successful with in this video was to make country dirty.  This animated gif of her boobs hanging out isn't country, it's trash.
Dumbest song I’ve ever heard
Beyonce is the best song
Today is June 13th 2024 this comment  is been made at 5:56 Usa center time
I made it 40 seconds
Beyonce gets blond hair and is country come on I die my hair black and I am racist
Who created this crap. This woman is a very talented puppet. HOW could she agree to this boring waste of time?
WTF 🤣🤣🤣
The intro was crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
🎵 🎶there's a tornado in my city!!!!!! 🎶🎵
Kq‹l
Texas Texas Texas Texas
That is absolutely lame...
I'm disappointed in her outfit....or lack thereof.  I thought it would be in better taste to have cowgirl'd up!
How did this song make it to number one?😊
She's super sexy
Nope, that's not country to me. It's just not in her voice.
Great song. Crap video
❤
It has visualizer in the title
Karen Jones theme?
Franklin like that
This song is horrible A bar song (Tipsy) by shaboozey is better
Ela descobriu que não precisa fazer nada além de um vídeo de 10 segundo seminua
What a boring video 😐 I expected more
Tuck back oops, vest was supposed to be slide on oops.
❤
Trash
Sugar
Awful… complete garbage …
I wish I was kissi’n Kate Barlow in the movie holes 😢
Because having white rappers is just fine     She killed it!!🔥🔥🔥   Fu𝕮𝕮 whatchall think 💯♿🩼
She’s cute 😊
As a Texan we disown her. What a travesty
Why do Texans hate her so much?
Jay Z should be so proud!😂
Actually, I think this is Texas.
Love it!
nein, das ist wirklich nicht texas. und hey, 10-wochen-mann, für dich schreib ich sogar englisch:  no matter how many times you praise the song, beyonce still won't sleep with you  😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 😇
This ain’t Texas! Yeah!
I have a conspiracy theory that she didn't actually sing this and they just used AI to mimic her voice and had someone else with a similar singing style record it 😂
D͓̽e͓̽e͓̽e͓̽e͓̽e͓̽g͓̽f͓̽
Theres a new queen of country. And her name is Beyonce.
Action, cut Action, cut Action, cut Action, cut 😌😌😌😌
Sure aren't we all country now?
Make the Video as cheap as possible.  Sound like you're tired as fuck.
The cheapest video ive seen ye ,has she run out of money.
I live  in Texas  I'm  a cowgirl
Perfect summer song 😊
This song is a vibe idc idc
Wow this song sucks lol
THIS SONG FUCKING SUUUUUUCCCKKKKSSSSS!!!!!
Stupid video.  Of all of the creative artists in the world this is the best they can come up with??
Hi
Garbage ass music as always 🔥
Westworld vibe there
You are naked 😂
She could have stood in one spot an still killed it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🩷
This sounds like the Franklin theme song🐢
Garbage garbage garbage
Oh my gosh. Lord help us all.
Uhm yh I love ur songs Beyoncé but y tho show the private....I LOVE UR VIDS U QUEEN
Consistent tasteless trash
This sounds so good! 🤤
Ugly ass song, don’t understand why they playing this shit in European radios since we don’t care about country culture, let me know when it’s out of trend so I can turn my radio up again…
Nuppp “Tipsy” by shaboozey way damm better
Sorry, but way way too overproduced....  and it really doesn't blend the pop/country vibes... shaboozey is doing it right and sounds hungry...Beyonce just seems bored. I'm just not digging it...
That's a lot more faith in dress-tape than i ever had when i was still competing in Dance.
My God what a POS song on every level except the decent vocal performance.
Why celebrities people getting naked always are they singing or doing porn film
O vídeo na minha opinião e muito vulgar, principalmente pra mulher casada, mais da musica eu gostei muito, 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔Deus fez o mundo em seis dias, e descansou no sétimo dias.
Is This song available to set as caller ringtone??
You will never be country

When you mix rap with country you get crap
Looking chunky
❤ I Love country music! ❤⚘
Kreek listened to this song on March 23, 2024. Man, I was laughing so hard when he listened to this song.
That was close to the private parts
HOT FARTS!!
F A K E 👀🤪🤮😜😂😂
Je l'adore mais est ce utile d'afficher son corps.....le naturel sans chichi c'est mieux 😉
Not a fan!!!!!  She ain’t country that’s for sure.
❤😊👍🇵🇷
Hell nah
Einfach Mega!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Super Stimme, Sie  kann einfach Alles und Sie muss nicht so viel zeigen 😢
Stupid video
❤
Beyonce singing about a dive bar is like Elon Musk singing about food stamps.
i love this
Legends are lying that she’s still doing these steps
lol so bad
Love the song!!💯❤❤
Other artist are clapping your song beyonce  tho fr nobody playing  your song
When you only have that one thing you can think of
TACK
Nah she has abs
This is a horrible song, and would have been better with Miley Cyrus singing it, re re finds anyway to be half naked, ain't nothing country about this trick!!!!!!
What is an official visualizer???
Singer ❌ nudity show ✅
Some artists should not cross over into country music
One of my favor song..❤❤❤💪👍🇵🇷🎵🎶🥰
🇵🇷my girl❤🎶🎵💪👍
Love her 🎶🎵💪👍😅
O yes 😂👍💪🇵🇷🎵🎶🙏♥️
Budget for video $24.65 yup this video whack dodo
I think someone need to teach them how to do their jobs
The song is great I'm surprised i just don't understand why this woman always has to be naked like wtf it doesn't even correlate to the song. And ppl wonder why Taylor is bigger.
She might aswell start going nude
Sei la migliore del mondo 😘😘😘
Ist sie ein Avatar?
😂😂😂 i cant say what i want to say
Love❤❤❤
❤
I’m tryna figure out why some people hate this song 😐
Le maximum de bonheur avec ses douceurs de son
Unica🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Notice the all seeing eye of the Illuminati
-.- just stop Beyoncé stick to hip hop please
❤
I wanted to see the line dancers
❤
I'm sorry but it looks  like the start of a porn film
A true artist, not afraid to study and explore different genres! She’s definitely the Queen of Music!
A Beyoncé country line dance hit was not on my bingo card for 2024  BUT IM HERE FOR IT
Blöd einfach !
Ich hasse dich und das lied ist einfach dumm und nicht lustig! Video ist 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Coucou en français on fait une coré sur cette musique 🎶
Oh look beyonce selling her body...9h wait she's been doing that for like 20 yrs now
Who’s listening this in June 2024? We’re doing it from Space!
The best song ever
Great song but really crappy video
Yow! Now I want a Metal album. Is she Borg?
Mye mye chime 🎐
tho its the short where is the short?
I can see why this gets a lot of hate
I Love You song
Ridiculous outfit
She ain't a Texas girl and I don't care if she comes from Houston, Austin or Dallas. 🫣
Bored
Many of you on here ain’t shit! Why be here or anywhere on these videos, whether it’s Beyoncé or whoever the celebrity is, just to talk some shit about them? For those of you doing this, you all need to graduate past the ignorance, and get some act right. SMH!
Shitty ass song
Illuminati 304
No me gusta, esta canción me da sueño. Y este estilo les gustará en Texas
BEYONCÉ THEEE QUEEN
you vote red for the love of freedom
My PE teacher did this song for PE and the next day he wasn’t here. I’m pretty sure he was fired 💀 🔥 👍
Tried to give her  a chance,but this really sucks. No Country Girl would dress like this.
She ain't dolly
Stupid
She doesn't need to introduce herself. She has already done her job.
Keep going honey ❤❤❤❤❤
Frankiln ahh beat
This goes hard on mute 🔥🔥🔥
Sound a bit like Lady Gaga's - Teeth
Ive been so much thro last year im loving this song
This is a really classless video
Stupid
Da vi se moćqm na site filozofii po moj varvarski  grb 🇲🇰
Sad that she feels the need to oversexualize herself to sell records.
And do litte mermied moves with your daught and kim just a loving sergestion come from a friend
Hi this precious you would look real wonderful in the role of gen from the x men series love❤😂🎉
❤
Idk what the hype is about this song, it's annoying
Why this music video on repeat?
Personally, not my thing, not that song. Just not my type of country music
Good song Beyonce kills it again
um why does it say 57 seconds for more then like ten second i didnt know that was possible
this song sucks
Stay in your lane girl.  this aint country.  its another show of flesh.  WTH
no
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and speak for all of California and demand the rest of America that the Wild Wild west, will be known as the Wild wild wild west. Wild cubed, if ya will. Or our delegates are gonna fuck you up.
I love you ❤️
Umm nope 👎
Wow. So it actually did suck. I guess when Taylor Swift scares you to another genre of music, you can expect this low quality crap.
❤❤❤
Garbage
Lol! This is crap💩💩💩
The only thing that stays the same is change. Help me Wutang! Help us Nas.
What a song
Stupid video
0:28
I did not get bullied all through school for liking country music for THIS to be the reason folks like it.  Edit: The way some people will fight to the end for a celeb who doesn’t even care about them is actually sad.
Love you
Ohhh no😂😂😂😂😂😂  my favorite my modèle  my experience❤❤❤
was brey
It doesn't seem to have proved a major hit, I'm not hearing it on the radio these days
It is a very catchy song and her stocking and black undies remind me of dancer Caldina from Magic Knight Rayearth.
la prochaine fois met rien tu vas gagner du temps
r'habille toi non de dieu
10 weeks at the top of the billboard country chart. The people have spoken.
I guess the older and less popular you get the more titty is shown I like this
Que canción más mala👎🏼
Nope
Down
So bad... (Not being sarcastic, or saying she's "Bad". It's just awful.)
Um I would change this ain't Texas to this is Texas
Lady Gaga vibe 🎉
This is just the same thing over and over again😂😂😂😂
🚫 not ,Beyoncé ,Madona,Anita, Biden, lula,  ❤hollyshit
Did an AI write these lyrics? They play this song all the time at my workpalce and everyone hates it. Many of them are fans of her too
She is real slapper
Ffs. I tried years ago to tell my girl students that stripping to their bodies was wrong. Why is this woman doing this? She has such a following. I think if I met her I would have a serious conversation about responsibility for actions. Shame on you Beyoncé slapper.
i know she is dressed for show but what makes them think that  nakedness is beautiful because it’s not.  makes her look cheap. she is such a beautiful woman she doesn’t have to portray herself like that.
It is a GIF
She sucks but then again all country music sucks nowadays.
Nice.. great role model for any women looking to be viewed as someone with no self respect and as a hoe
Zilch for talent. But great attempt at looking white.
How in the world did she know a Tornado was gonna hit Houston? This song came out weeks before 🤔
This is horrible
Please Pray the Rosary & Divine Mercy Chaplet to free all countries from war, hunger, calamities, corruption, abortion, divorce, drugs, pornography, homosexuality, slavery, communism,wars and all evils.pls. pray for peace and joy on all families and homes... HAIL MARY FULL OF GRACE THE LORD IS WITH YOU. BLESSED ARE YOU AMONG WOMEN AND BLESSED IS THE FRUIT OF THY WOMB JESUS. HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD PRAY FOR US SINNERS NOW AND AT THE HOUR OF OUR DEATH. AMEN.
❤
Not country
Search Jimmy the ostrich.. Didn't know this song existed until watching him. Please check him out, you won't regret it :)
The worst song shes ever made in her career
I think she like to do the cheapest videos for her music. She just walking a doing the gun finger thing. I bet she wins a reward for this song.
Lol….. This is an funny video.. 💯😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Boring 😢
Nope for me.
Obszön
So Jay z paid I don't know the some amount of money to his record stations to pay his wife's song they said no
I came here thinking I was going to hear country music. I was awfully wrong
Beehive or not I'm sorry this is not a good video the song is okay but the video is just boring
Producer: what you gonna were?   Beyonce: you don't wanna know
Came here to say i dont understand the hype it sounds awful
Hh😊
Batida maravilhosa ❤
Your country has so much gun violence, so corrupted by so many AIPAc controlled. Dirty, not free at all. Gun violence is the big one, and you pretend to shoot from your hand as you fireing the gun. I find it sick with such a following as saying guns are cool.
❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is she okay?
Mega Sound!!!
Que desperdicio de canción para ese video 🤦🏻‍♀️
Thats my girl❤❤❤🎶🎵👍🇵🇷💪
That music video......?????
It was 22 seconds that’s how I got it right
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is Beyonce dressed as a sexy Borg?
So hot
This song and video SUCK
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pollo no ogm,senza antibiotici
Pollo
I just dont get it.
Beyoncé fell off. Worst singer ever. Went from singing about her ass to singing country to stay relevant
Bless you. Never knew someone would publish a song when they have a cold
Same why do they have her doing the same thing over in over
She's a mother yet still dresses like this?? Really?....
Beyoncé isn’t country.. she needs to stay in her own lane
Shaboozy country song hits 100x better than this haha 😂
Who made this Yippity Doo Haw ass song 😂
Nah. I been told i act white so ima be petty lmfao, all yall brothers and sisters  saying this song good, you lost your n pass 🤓 be proud
This shouldn’t be a hit. It’s a “meh”. If you disagree, your standard are low
Is Beyonce singing the 🎵 this is lottie
Haters omg,girls got it,girl flaunts it damn you all would too
Love it love her,if you got it flaunt it
Cuz she's good at it lmao
Possibly the laziest music video ever made. Send her to the jug doctor, done.
nice song and nice ti*s
This is by far one of the worst songs ever created….
Is this Culture cancelling?
Yo no vine haber los comentarios
How come she’s not wearing a cowgirl outfit?🤷‍♀️…she’s almost naked singing like a caw girl…not matching!..no,no!,..love the song 🎶 though 👍 ?
Perfect mounds. 🙂
Terrible video clip. Boring. Song is ok 🆗
Funny how addicting things get when Jay z fucks with vibrational energies..
boring
She is a real diva❤🎶
😂🎵🎵🎶👍❤
I like this song!!
Yes..... when ever I think of a cowgirl I think of some chick wearing heels, bikini rype of underwear with fishnet stockings, and pretty much assless chaps for a shirt.  This is why country music sucks. It's just pop music with someone trying to put a twang accent on lyrics. Yes this is nothing near country. My Spotify playlist has like 5-6k songs and like 10 or less are country. The old time gritty country needs yo come back (not like I'm much of a fan or ever have been, but country was way better a decade plus ago).   Kind of wish YouTube still showed the amount of dislikes videos had. Been a pretty good one to see.
:41 of the song did not age well!
Loser
Loser😂😂😂
She bleaches the fk out of her skin..look at how much darker she was before. WTF
I love this song !❤❤❤
Must be a sense 🎉
This ain’t Texas🤠 Ain’t no hold em👋 So lay your cards down down down🃏
💯❤️‍🔥hot🥵❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Trash
That was a cheap video to make.
Video sucks
Worst video ever
Ale fajna sprawa
❤❤❤
Country is one of the only music genres that they don't like to hoe-ify.   I like Beyonce but don't ruin the innocence of country music by literally ALWAYS HAVING TO HAVE YOUR BITS OUT!   You're gonna ruin it when everyone else starts to copy. I'm not religious or anything but honestly, where's the modesty nowadays? Nothing left to the imagination anymore...
It was so good pay for me Be❤❤❤🎶🎶🎶🎶🦾🦾💫👍👑🎀💕💎👑💰💲💲💲❌⭕❌😇
Looks like they're going to hold Beyonce instead Jail you go 🐝 I'll be compensated no matter what 🧪🗽☕💳✔️
Ain’t no way yall fw this 😭

I tried to just listen to the song. Couldn't even get through 1/4 of it. She ain't Texas!! And it's PATHETIC... Throw that song down down down damn
👍👍👍🦾🦾🎀❌⭕❌
Over over 🤪😜😝😁👍👌yes

-entrevistador:Beyonce cuentanos de tu nuevo video Beyonce: el video soy yo caminando  durante 10 segundos en un ciclo infinito, costo 80 millones de dólares
Coll
She really needs more clothes on. 😧😬 And more material in the video.
I'm sorry when this came out they played it so much it went out of style.
Why they wear like predators
She and her voice is weak. She just uses sex appeal to get attention
Omg I just lost 3:57 minutes of my life 😂😢😢😢
This an't country
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is not country !!! Lololololllol may God bless her achey breaky heart
Most boring video ever!!
Culture vulture
This song is honestly terrible lmfao
She is a stripper 😂😂😂😂😂 0:38
Cultural appropriation
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉hit the flor
TRASH
Awful, terrible song. @Shaunjohnson885 don't reply.
this is absolute trash
This ain't Country Music, more like an advertisement for Hoe's down on all four like dogs.
Je la fait pour la faite des ecolr
This ain't Country music, this is advertising for Hoe's down on all four.
Nice song. Silly video. Not sexy at all. It's far too in-your-face.
This song was shit garbage and anything to callit
What the fuck is this🤣🤣
This is not country why dont you stick to pop music
wekfest 2024 Nagoya 🔥🔥
Really
Excelent!
Trash
I don't have as much faith in that vest jacket as Beyoncé does.  Edit: I believe that in the reply section, I ignited a conflict.
This woman has a beautiful voice ❤❤❤❤❤ please like 2k
beyoncé
e
love you Bayonce❤️❤️❤️
This shit sucks
Absolutely stupid video…nothing to do with the lyrics, just selling sex.
she did this in 10 seconds and still has us watching the whole thing... 40 million times... THE NERVE, THE AUDACITYY HAHAHA
I HATE THIS SONG SO MUCH
Why "don't be a bitch" and "that shit ain't pretty"? Way to go, you found a way to ghetto up a country song. SMH!
This sounds just like here comes Franklin the theme from Franklin the turtle 1997
This is defo country 2024 . if she tours this Album love to see who her warm up acts are !! Willie ?
Nothings gonna take away from the fact that this song sucks. Sorry
Me realizing she predicted the tornado in Texas  Oh 67 likes that's cool
For a moment I thought there was something wrong with the video
Stupid video and a stupid song   she must be embarassed singing this song
Came here to thumbs down
*freaking hate country songs idc if she’s singing this isn’t good at all makes me hate her more*
$1 Ai song and video.
Musica da dumont
3:36
Mega 🎉
Oh my this truly is love at first sight!  How can she be on her own, how could anyone have fell out of love with such a beautiful natured girl. I'm not surprised she got a new family straight away, I bet. It was hard to not keep her yourself!!
well I don't need to watch all over again
On the real though shout out to shaboozey and the bar song cuz that's how you do a real country crossover
I'm all about hip-hop country crossovers but this just ain't hitting and let's talk about the video the fact that you've got all this money in your pocket and ties to some excellent videographers and this is what you come up with absolute trash
So what a shame you sound like Beyonce but it's a parent she didn't feel the f*** off her rocker
Most of my friends are black and so is my daughter but this is absolute garbage
Teledysk jest genialny!
Hino
I'm only six and I love Beyonce
Her voice is very awesome in multiple music genres!!
Nice try.   Anyway.
Imagine Beyonce's kids a few years from now looking at this in disgust
Beyoncé is trash with country music
Sino quieren hacer videos que no los hagan
Sexy=her
It’s astonishing how the pregnancies haven’t damaged her belly, no stretch marks. well done Beyoncé you and sharika must tell you re secret about pregnancy stretch marks
Nice song but that inappropriate  where shirt and pants  nobody see nude
Mrs fake country.
Still better than country sung by industry plants that got raised rich in suburbs.
Please don’t cheapen country music!
When Blue is going to do a nose job and turn blonde?
We all know why we really watched kt
😊🎉❤Beyonce hat eine hammer stimme 😊❤
Listen to this
but skirt 🥴👹👹👹👹👹🥴🥴
I'm trying to come up with words. A decade ago I had a weed induced panic attack to "get me bodied" I have always liked that song because it has a good beat and I was high as balls. Every other song of hers makes me wish I were deaf. I keep hearing about this song and her country thing. I had to watch the video and listen to this song. They definitely put a lot of effort into the video and the song is so good.im scared for what generations ahead call music.
Your vidos are bad
You are the best person. My mom said you every single day.😂❤
Beyonce has no telent she just has connection no one likes her just the curupt politions illimenotti
I get the visuality thing and cool, but I’d just like to see her do a traditional music video that’s alittle more story telling. Still am pleasantly surprised. ❤
Well I heard the song… great song! Wanted to see the video… well I will stay by just hearing it
That's the whole video just repeating of her walking in trust exercise with that vest?
I'm not interested in Disney world 🌍  ❤😂🎉🎉❤❤Veronica love children
I cannot see underwater I cannot see underwater  I cannot see underwater❤🎉
I regret watching
Trashy trash trash. Bring back the 60s and 70s
Queen B if you read my comment go listen_ Vitaa "Je Te le donne" feat slimane. Good french music. Some musical registers are not suitable for artists already accomplished in Rnb music.
I love this!
I want to scratch my eyes out
Porn........objectifying a women, can't believe she would stoop this low, nice example for young women.
❤❤💪Diva🎵🎶🥰🙏
aged gravitationaly challanged kluhnts are now in ut seems ;)
This song sucks
People actually listen to this crap?
She has more trust in that jacket than I have in my life 😂😂😂😂😂 please like
I am  3:01
Beyonce is one of the most versatile artists in the music industry.. She is not afraid to try new genres and experiment with different sounds and styles.. I LOVE THAT ABOUT HER!! This woman LITERALLY got folks out here buying cowboy apparel who had no thoughts of doing so before her album came out.. And has caused business to spike for Country and Western themed businesses.. Not to mention giving several Black Country Artists their FIRST Billboard chart hits, all because she chose to include them in her project... She realizes that it's not all about her and she takes the time to use her status to reach out and include others who don't get the credit or attention they deserve.... THAT is some serious influence!  Beyonce deserves ALL of the accolades, credit and appreciation she gets!  I SAID WHAT I SAID!
Davno nisam cula bolju pesmu🎉
I heard it seems that they show the same thing in the video.
This is shit, not county 👎🏻
video.gif
Fantastic song with terrible video clip
What in the actual F***!!!!! Stay in your lane
"Music sucks? Better show my tits."
Wow how disappointing.
So they just did one clip and put it in a loop and that’s the music video nowadays?
What a video!! I'd be embarrassed if this all you got!!
369(((((((🎉🎉🎉🤣🤣🤣🤣))))))>
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where are the jeans and cowboy hat? She's a disgrace to country music. Stick to the genre you are good at.
It's amazing how far the porn industry has come in the last 50 years.
Holy shit this song sucks
Terrible
She stole this, nothing original now a days  Go look up Franklin theme song exactly same beat she thief
Do people not know what a visualizer is?
So good
You can't sing country to save your life! 😂 stick to your awful generic pop music!!
Pokeys
I guess country music is so easy to write anyone can do it To beyonces credit, she bangs out a bit hit on her first try
Somehow, this video managed to bore me.
Si❤❤
I  love you  Beyonce ❤❤
❤❤❤
OMG
Part Star Trek part moron ....oh hell no
People really gonna comment and say the song is stupid, ok, then get tf on cause there are more people to say this song is great that what haters say, people just mad cause of how popular she is
Who is here in 2030?
It's Jespertime😂
Como nacio el baile vaquero? Si esta mujer no bailó
WTF,......Joke
So stupid
Cause she hate people  peoried
Simple ass music. 🤡
This is so fucking trash
Where's her shirt at??
Pretty good  Try the song. Till I get it right I think you might pull it off for A country music #1
Laisser tomber!!  le culte de cette belle femme afro américaine qui peut se payer cinq coiffeurs à 1000 dollars chacun ! sur une séance !?! wahouh quelle belle représentation de la femme noire! "tu veux qu'on déterre Bob Marley ou quoi ??! est ce que cette pseuso artiste à écris au moins une chanson dans sa vie ???!!!
But seriously she is sexy
Anyone know how I can block this video so my kids don't  give her streams .
Stupid stupid 😂😂😂😂😂😂that has no place in Country music. Watch me walk out👋🦨
Song just goes nowhere...
Omg please stop. You are not welcome in this genre.
Just leave us alone, Beyounce some where else!!! Texas has to much pride to except you!!!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/EcBanCb6V9U?si=icybO-9hfzgsQQrf  I found your biggest fans.
Crap
I hate this
Beyoncé u
Nce

Is this a Playboy advertisement, I'll buy the book so i can 👀👀 no vest, no worries, 😂
why is beyonce so white? when she first became famous she was much darker. in my opinion, making her more white is insulting to black americans.
Did Beyonce set out to make a gif and not a pop video.. I don't understand we're this was going or were it's not going..
Underware is unflattering for her figure
Jay z & me me me
where did them curls come from
If u love this song give thumbup
Beyonce is a joke ! Shes not country at all ! Only reason she is trying to go country is because of the success jelly roll and struggle jennings have had .
Good lord I wish Hank, Johnny and the gang were still around. Country music is dead.
0:40 hits 😢 hard because a Tornado 🌪️ was in her city like 05.16.24 devastating a chunk of Houston… What a prediction 😮… How creepy!!!
What a shit song. No wonder it's hated. Abysmal 😂
Canzone insopportabile. Comunque può anche vestirsi e coprire prosciutti e gomma finta.
Waste of everyone’s time including her own
This is hilarious. Jesus Christ.
Its as real as Drake talking about gangsta shit 😂😂
👽👽👽👽
Weeeeeemusyvetruedthishowweeetole PDF haawr
Goes to show how talentless see is, just repeating the same moves.....boring....
Oh gosh love the song but the video....nah
Beyonce.   Here is what we have to do!  Fire/terminate Kane Brown from American music industry immediately, because he can't sing.  He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.  There were many country singers who tried to help him out so that he could stay in country music business, but he failed every time.  He just can't sing and sounds hideous!      Chris Young, Hardy, Blake Shelton, Marshmello, Khalid, H.E.R., John Legend and Lauren Alaina (Not a singer just American Idol contestant loser): almost every country singer tried to work with him, but failed.  No future for that dude.
Horrible
😂
Play I set this on replay LOL
She just wrecked her career maybe her stupid husband thought it's a good idea
So I've listened to this song now forcefully. I will say it is a catchy song. It's like the chicken dance song , a fun song. You could put it in your play list with those fun dance songs like the zorba, nutbush, the hustle, line dance. I bet people secretly dance to it at home hahaha
Why does Beyonce videos and pictures look like porn recently....
Oh Beyonce just perform naked, it won' t makes any difference... Below low snd shallow. Thats alllllll
This is not country what so ever just country words and this song is absolutely garbage of a song 🤣🤣🤣
Ts Ass nd yk it
she ain't country and will never be country I'm sorry y'all 😭🙏🏼
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This sounds like Beyonce trying to do country music.
This song suck, go watch #postmalone
I love it. Being a native Houston like Beyonce..she is truly Queen B
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stopped Lovin Her Today
This little light of mine 😂
NO, NO, NO
She ain’t country music
Song is great. Video is shit
I love dancing around  the bedroom to this
I’m confused where is the rest of the video?
Imagine the same dress but the head is A.Merkel. The old chancler 😂😂😂😂
just stop you’re not country at all😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nah. I'd rather Madonna Don't tell me. Madonna's wayyyyy better then b
Sério?
Great Song
I'm not a big fan of her but I do dig the song
Soft core porn
Not my type of country. 👎
My friend Edward is your bigger fan
WTF>>>>LOL LOL LOL ..OH MY, SUCH TALENT!!!!  NO??  I AGREE...SAAAAAAAD
Wowowowowowowowowowowowo is do you sectiste ou ray or oh em texta ou
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that she showed her boobs
This song goes so hard on mute
Snake over over left eye 🙄👎
Thus is a country song? Not even close
And the crowd goes home! 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
This woman can dance her ass off... so why do they have her doing the same thing over and over!!!😮
The tune of the song is good. Without showing any naked bodies they can't make videos 😢😢😢
This is the biggest waste of time.
This aint country, she has to put naked boob shots just so people will view it...go back to gangster songs
cual es el video oficial? no creo que sea este
Please do not say this is country music......
I finally understand the hate from real country fans, after watching 👀 this video. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
A BAR SONG IS BETTER
What the hell did I just watch. Wtf kinda none existing outfit was that? That was horrible.
Hate from LA
Ngl if i ever heard someone say that she is better than George Strait or Toby Keith i might just go berserk.
As a proud Texan this is the one of the worst happen to us apart Apart From Waco, TX And Uvalde
いい曲が台無し😭😭😭
Nice
Ilove music
Music, lyrics 🎉, video 💩.
If your really country go outside in your pj's and ride a horse bare back in a large feild with sunflowers
Go girl I love absolutely love your song!
Sounds like the usual crap.. How many people did you have to write this shite
Glad to see her try new things but this is not it.
Song not to bad, but video sucks. Country is not about half naked women with a patch on her eye. Does she even know how to dress proper or dance  country?
Beyoncé, a changé. C’est nul ! Je m’ennuie avec ses musiques…
This song is absolute shit
What the hell did I just listen to?
Beyonce.   Here is what we have to do!  Fire/terminate Kane Brown from American music industry immediately, because he can't sing.  He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.

This ain’t Lexus, just Toyota
She is showing more cleavage than our girl Nicki.
Not a fan but I like this genre that she used so im gonna listen to this...
This Girl is NOT legal.....😉😉😉😉😉😉😉 beware of Ya kids....🧐🧐🧐🧐     😜😜😜😜😜 From MY HOLY GERMANY😇🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
And I'm not saying it isn't a catchy song, but not, IMHO, a country song.
This video is trash. Her walking in and doing the same thing over and over? Sorry, but this isn't country. Sorry Beyonce, we aren't stupid. Just adding instruments that are used in country doesn't make it country. I wish you had taken this seriously.
best song worst vid
🇰🇼🇰🇼💘💘اغنية حلو KWT 💘💘💘Kuwait
This is no country song 😅
I feel nauseous 🤢 🤮
How many deez comments bots
This song is trash
This wasn't even worth 20 seconds
Texas Let 'Em Go! ♠♥♦♣ 🔫I guess Jay-Z spent all their money bribing radio stations to play her music, they didn't have the money to spend on a dance routine.
The worst song ever
Stupid..
It takes a good whououre to continue to sell the same garage 💩💩🥉
Love the song, but HATE the video.  Everything doesn't have to be about an almost naked woman strutting her stuff. Make the video about the song or dancing.  It honestly looks like someone just pasted together a bunch of clips from previous videos and then added a woman with ridiculously long nails riding a horse.
Hehh cest Franklin 🕺🕺🕺
Ummm
Totally disappointing! The best song with a video like this.
Alter, sieht die geil aus😊
Ghetto
i dont like how Beyoncé is wearing such reveling clothes.....and worst the vid just goes over ad over again.
This is the dumbest thing ever.
That role ain't no model 😂😂😂😂one big disappointment 😢😢 when are you going to tell your fans, how many people u killed for out shining u
It's. not. about.  you. It's about THEM. Stay in your lane.
Snore, this lightweight country rap thing is so played
This is a terrible video! It’s just the same thing over and over. This sounds like the Franklin cartoon song.
What’s this? Its country feel, but you’re not it. You’re too famous.
"how many minutes u wanna film this " :"yes"
This is not country
Not that anyone asked me, or would ever ask me, or cares that nobody asked me... But there was so much talk around Beyoncé doing this that I expected way, way more. (That beat is sweet, but too soft, it needs to drop harder... and Cowgirl Beyoncé I have yet to see, for in this video she is not.)
The songs not bad but that outfit is really bad
It sounds like this ain’t texas
This aint country and never will be no matter how many time yall say it.
Why are you doing country?  You’re not country at all at all at all.  Did you sell yourself to the Illuminati or something?  Makes no sense.  Don’t care about the boob flash at all.  Please stop.
How can her agent let her think this is good. 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Beyonce is stoo peedd.. This song is stoo peeed!
She needs to stick to what she does and stay out of the country music. This was really bad. Country folk driving Lexus, ge
Probably an unpopular opinion, but this isn't country music, and it never will be. This is about as country as Old Town Road, and even that was better than this.
Beyoncé sucks. Always has.
Stupid song and absolutely boring video. What exactly is the point of this video? Is it just to show off her body?
Me and my friend love this song so much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
C est quoi cet exhibisionnisme à la noix😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
J ai bien aimé la chanson,  mais moins depuis que j ai vu le clip😮😮😮😮😮😮
I hate this song please delete it
All that money and clip on repeat, good song though
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If white women do African braids, it's discrimination, but if a black woman does a cowgirl from the 1950s, it's ok. What a double standard.
This has to be one of the worst songs of 2024
It's so hard not to be jealous dear Beyonce <3
A Beyoncé country line dance hit was not on my bingo card for 2024  BUT IM HERE FOR IT
This must be music and music video’s version of frozen vegan pizza. It taste like cardboard
Are Beyoncé the northern angels what do you reckon to the song we thought you play the very well please remember where you earning from first and it wasn't from your songwriters the song and just remember and just remember the Lord is always watching so please find it in your heart to believe in God and Christ and also the northern angels the song you're singing my niece call Lucia and Claire choose you to sing it for them enjoy
why she's so white
4 minutes of singing the same few lines the entire song. Really tells a story and foul mouth one at that.
I don’t hear no country in her voice. Sounds more like pop music. I hate. Go back to your old music
If you're interesting enough, you don't have to show your boobs. Just sayin.
Nope
Like watching paint dry😅
I can write better songs this is crap 💩
I find it hard to believe this is the actual music video
This is one of the worst songs on the airwaves🤮 She knew why she was half naked. This song is such crap
I like your song is so beautiful🛼🛼🥋🛼😍😍😍😍😍🛼
Came to listen to what everyone was talking about.  What a pile of trash.   Stick to BLM, you aren’t country.
Country music originated from African.  A beat and the telling stories to the beat.  Country music is so close to Rap, when they hate each others’ music, they’re fools.  Same with Judaism, Islam and Christianity.  All Abrahamic.  Judaism is older than Christianity did better marketing/war.  Then the youngest religion, Islam, was so ‘cheated,’ they wanted to keep their land.
I like the part where she shoots a spark out of her finger
Spay
She’s on crack 😂
The tune is great. The video effort maybe not so.
Anyone that is talking is about her and her music ask yourself if u can do it. U guys stop hating on her. U do something better than her.😂😂😂😂😂
Well don't watch it
The is tornado in basement 😂
Sorry, a super song, but a monotonous video!
Terrible attempt at appropriation
This is country? It’s literally just a fast pace franklins theme song with the most used words in every country song
Beyonce might have to look out before that javket falls off or I might flip out
Que lastima,  todo el mundo esta bailando su video menos Ella.
Amo a Beyoncé, pero ese video hay que meterlo a la carcel porque es demasiado Malo.
I need to lern that same song for school
This music video is as bad as the song 😂
just as I think that in RENAISSANCE the wrong keys were played (and it is a good album with a gem like BREAK MY SOUL) in COWBOY CARTER it is as if they played all the right keys at the same time AWESOME..... winning album Thank you BEYONCE
A wife and mother of 2.....and these white folks have his wife and mother of his children out here all but naked .... The disrespect is over 39 million viewers strong. ...Lord send me something to believe in.... GRADE F.
This is the wackest "country " song ever. Just cause you say it's cou try doesn't mean it is country.
They said it was the game of a lifetime.
Bastos! I'm out.
what did she smoke b4 the video? weird as!!
Terrible try,   sounds like a wanna be  (Led zeppelin - Bron yr stomp )
ME GUSTA BELLA 🎉❤🎉
Uhh ... I was expecting that tiktok dance. Oops. At least the song is good
What a disgusting creature that is.
This sucks
https://youtu.be/Dos5pf5OMNM?si=zu1H-3GMrTfUCmS4
Aaliyah forever!💖
I’ll pay for ur bra!
It's friggin hot, and well excecuted, I'm satisfied
What's she doing singing about *Texas* ? She and Texas have _NOTHING_ to do with each other -- THANK GOD _HE BLESSED TEXAS_ !
My god all these fake views
Horrible...her actions dont match the lyrics..its just her showing off her boobs. She needed to be dancing to the song which is quite good. Couldnt watch it.
This is literally the worst fucking song ever created. Yikes
I call this video cringe. Anyone feel same?
I feel like I'm in a movie with this song, it's beautiful, my respects to Beyonce 👏🏽👏🏽
they were right, country fans have to be the most conservative, retrogade, annoying, insufferable people to ever exist
WHY NO SHIRT YoUr grounded😡😡😡😡
Fucking perverts rewind...good old fashioned line dance would've been better
BENOIT CAROLINE
Aweful song and video
Did Beyoncé run out of money?
❤🎉😊
She stole it from Franklin The Turtle cartoon
Yo this is a slapper ass conservative Jatt song!!!!
Song sucks
Overrated
Dog shit
What is a visualizer? New term?
wtf was that? Na … Beyoncé became the queen of appropriation!
What a shame  :  hope the REAL country singers  boycotting this bs . She can go through all the genre . that don’t make her the queen of anything .
This is not good.
She a perv. Worst song and worst video EVER ! Yuk!
Don't have to dress like that to sing country music. Ruined your video by dressing like that. Where did you see other female country singers dress like that?   It's a good song. Hate the way you dressed.
One word: Cheap
They missed an opportunity to make a fun or beautiful video.  Mountain! Country land. Creeks. People playing cards, or having a BBQ.  So many dance options. The video designer should be fired as they ask agreed to make this extremely simple and boring video.
At this point of her career, she does not need to be overly revealing.
stop messing with country
If country is crap this is a whole other level, it's like the turd lay a turd over another turd and water it down with the most vanilla guitar chords
Bring back bullying
Video que fácilmente puedes ver sin audio 🤤🤤
Louder tall girls like that song 👍 👏 🎵 👏 🎵 q😘😘😘😀😀
No, ..Pleeeease No... .
This is not country music.
Terrible video!  The guys on Instagram are more inspiring!!
I love this song
❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ik hor Disne op 1000 ni
Beyoncé co-wrote the song "Texas Hold 'Em" with Nathan Ferraro, Elizabeth Lowell Boland (Lowell), Megan Bülow (bülow), and Raphael Saadiq. She also co-produced it with Killah B and Nathan Ferraro. Directed by Nadia Lee Cohen. The snake sunglasses was a good touch. it's a stage props by Beyonce's set designer team starring Es Deviln.
Lol Beyoncé: "I've become irrelevant, so now I'll tackle country." Yeah, country is just fine without you, sweetheart. You can let yourself out.
So is she a porn star these days? Or why the whorish clothing?
Why show yourself like that this is boring real boring
Presupuesto bajo 👎👎👎👎👎👎
What the fuck is this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the song is fine! but the rest?!  😂😮
Aiai, decepcionada😢
The perfect mom role model
Beyoncé kinda wasted her time doing the music video because usher keeps doing the same thing over again 😢
The song: You are my sunshine  YouTube: This gotta be Texas Hold'em
Best video ever
I love this song
No effort
Absolutely fucking God awful.  She's a decent singer but this is fucking stupid
The lady call sing anything.  Stop picking
I like you because you're very beautiful
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂why They got this girl doing the same thing over and over like what did she do?😂😂😂😂😂😂 lol 😆 I’m Cracking up right now
I like the song, but why does she have to show her off her body? Makes no sense.
Poser looking for more money... Jesus what crap stay in ur lane she's got talent.... This is maniplate number one song
Amazing music with low budget MV!! For me This visual destroyed the beauty of the song!!! But taxes Hold my favorite SONG!!
I love the song...the video could very better
Decent song.  Totally lame video.  A PEWPEW  with the fingers once is enough. Not a fan of the costume.
Biden assistants wrote this.
This Georgia!
Short video clips are more beautiful from this. So sloppy
This is the dumbest video ever
Great song and artist ... very poor costume choice....any parent with young female girls should not be letting them watch this video.  You may see  more on a beach but its what she's doing it for...to give a sexualised message to sell a song
I love Beyoncé just not a fan of country music so this doesn’t do it for me.
2 questions.  1. Why are her tits out, do shirts not exist to pop stars?  2. why is there so few dislikes? MAKE THIS THE MOST DISLIKED VIDEO!!!
Visualizer?
This is probably the trashiest thing I’ve ever seen and pathetic as hell
❤️💜💚💙💛💛💛💛💜💜💜💜⚖️
This song makes me want to vote for Trump. Trump 2024
Yeah that is definitely not an illuminati eye patch.
POV: me trying to watch the vid and i realize is the same thing over and over again 😢😂💀
That’s the whole video 😂
Stay black we’ll stay white
Tolles Lied,ein richtiger Ohrwurm ❤

Beyonce, I love you. Thank you for allowing  people of color to belong  in country music.
😳I was hoping to see her dancing or something else? 😅
wow this is really good i love you beyonce
Ummm….. why….?
Lazy video on repeat. The video makes absolutely no sense. I couldn't even watch it all the way through, but that's ok, cuz after the first few seconds of it, you've already seen it all.
Have to dress like a $2 farm implement??
the song is ok. it is catchy but that outfit is so ugly, if she is gonna do a country video, dress country in like levi's plaid shirt  cowboy hat and boots, she can show cleavage but damn that outfit hairstyle an makeup look like she was in mad max movie .. might as well be a ho if u are gonna dress like one.. .. that outfit does not fit with the song at all, no way
Beyonce it's all over the screen I wasn't able to hold it 🙏😫😫
Lame
not much imagination on the content in this one.... pretty boring
Not a fan.
is 10
Check out the real video not  just a repeated clip .😊
Oh this is so bad!!! The video and the song! Ugh just terrible
what the hell did i just listen to need to go jam a screwdriver in my ear
That’s pure trust into jacket technology right there.
Ehhhh
It's not country
Why is she naked she is a mom
This is not a country song. How embarrassing.
I have no cards left.😊
Franklin the turtle song
You keep singing Miss Beyonce I'll be there to cheer you on
Producer: What type of dance routine are we gonna use on this video?  Beyonce:  Nah.
Stupid
I love this song
Beyonce.   Here is what we have to do!  Fire/terminate Kane Brown from American music industry immediately, because he can't sing.  He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.  There were many country singers who tried to help him out so that he could stay in country music business, but he failed every time.  He just can't sing and sounds hideous!      Chris Young, Hardy, Blake Shelton, Marshmello, Khalid, H.E.R., John Legend and Lauren Alaina (Not a singer just American Idol contestant loser): almost every country singer tried to work with him, but failed.  No future for that dude.
The song is oke but the video???  where is that queen with her nice videos sorry but this is like shit then don't make a video at all Princess
She is a reviver from firefly 😂😢
This kinda sucks....
Enisa has nothing on you 🤔 it's not all about showing breasts and half fanny. Beyonce she's a CURB!!!!
Nope
I love this song 💞🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song! Shame on people who think we don't have the freedom or right to sing any damn thing we want, especially with a voice like Beyonce! It's is fun with a great beat...
We get it Beyounce you got breaststroke. With your extreme talent you don't need to show them.
Matrixx muppet
Awesome
Just Stop! Really don't like this song. Comes on and I'm yelling, No no no no nooooo! and about destroy my radio to turn it.
Sad, not somethin I thought she would stoop to. I used to idolize her, now I just can't. I got a daughter n I don't want her to think this is normal.
What happened to her voice? I thought it was a dude?
My song SUCkS...whoo! I don't know country music...WHoo!!!... SUCKS...whoo!!
It’s a very hard no for me made it to 1:02
The gag is yall think she's new to this when she's true to this lol
East bound and down, loaded up and trucking, were going to show them what can't be done.  Better earworm than this.
Buy a lexus?
This. Is. Country. I hear all the greats in this album. I hear the wild, sweet, sad soul that they all shared. Beyonce, I couldn't name a single thing you did before this album. This is so so good. The best country turns country on its head. All the best new country has been looking back. You looked forward. And absolutely nailed it.
Her music “video clip” is so boring lmao
Great song. Video NO
Cultural appropriation ?¿
A true new classic in 2021 & beyond I saw you Beyonce when you came to Norfolk, Virginia United States back in 2020 with Pharell Williams & friends for the Something in the Water festival out in Virginia Beach, Virginia I was born in Fort Worth, Texas United States June 21st, 1982, we both from Texas Beyonce I'm on Instagram Facebook Twitter I'm 41 years old Norfolk's home Matt...
Me encanta! Es diferente a todo lo que ha echo musical,beyonce! 😊😊😊😊 para mi una de las mejores canciones aunque creais que es 7na cancion simple de caboy! Es tremenda..me recuerdaa doly parton que es mi idola de la musica contry!!!!
This is so dumb😂
Every time it plays on the radio while I'm driving, I feel like I forgot to turn off the turn signal.
W L F
Was it necessary to be half naked ???
This is stupid
Love it 🎉🎉🎉❤
Would be nice if u put some clothes on not everything she does is gold lol
Hello Francklin
This song is garbage.
Beyonce is taking over Country Music lol No. For one the songs not that good, second this is basically Kiss 1979 Disco Album Dynasty. It's a Gimmick lol and y'all  wasted your money on it🤣🤣🤣🤣😴😴
This absolutely sucks. I would come back from the dead to change this if it came on
Thats not country...and she is no country singer...who did she steal this song from usually the 50s with her
O video tem nada aver com a música
She should stay away from this Genre 🔥🔥
Nope
This whole album is fluff and disrespectful to country stars and to all it means. Rude and not a good look. U didn’t win. Sorry honey 🍯 stealer .covers of classics and the rest just a Beyoncé album.100% not county. What’s sad is that you had access to county legends
Honestly this video is genius. I'm not a fan of the song but she is looking beyond stunning. I'm more than halfway through this video.
Super
At least u see her puppies
This is trash I cant believe people listen to this
Nothing country Stay in your line girl
I don’t know why everyone hates this song. I’ve been listening to it with the volume off and it sounds pretty good.
This can't be the real video
a horrible video for a horrible song
Nice
One of the dumbest videos I've ever seen I would expect ALOT MORE from such a talented woman. Definitely not representing the females very well smdh
Well real country girls don't dress half naked as far as  being country it takes more than that try being raised on a farm. I bet she can't rope a steer! Lol
Redneck woman ❤
Omg this is so good, almost lime Gretchen ❤
This is the wort song I Eva  heard

The Queen of my heart x❤❤❤
This is political goal, for trumpist to like black people and not voting trump ..... Sure obama asked her to do so🎉.
Damn that t**s and @$$ just loved them so much
Most annoying song of 2024…
The empire State of China Asia 🐒🐒🐸 their favorite banana is is bumpy banana bumpy for the English would call it apple banana  But because Beyonce is lackaton banana 🍌  It's smooth😅❤🎉
This is going down as one of the worst songs in human history
Beyonce really shows her texan roots in a good way ❤
Best Tune Beyonce has Ever Had Out 🔥✨✌️👈👉👉👈
I think they think country music fans are stupid and would swallow any BS.
I was waiting for, wait, what somebody said she was singing something? I didn't notice. I was waiting for it to...
Too much black ❤
She looks like a stripper!! Not a country singer
Don't be a smart horse 🐎🐎👛😮🎉
Kool song
What the ever loving hell are you doing with fingers? Want a real gun? I can lend you you .22
This is horrendous. I- I hate my wife for this
This is terrible. I’d rather stay sober
My wife is forcing me to listen to this so I can have the last joint 😒
Press says she’s the greatest country star ever. Period. If you feel otherwise you are a racist.
That is so so this is in Texas, but I like the song but why do you do it over over again that is so so so so so so over over again
Is this legit the actual music video and not just a sample?
bidens world
Why was I not told about this song and had to come across it by accident when someone used a portion of it for their Insta reel???!!!!!!! Dam you, YT!!! 🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍💛💛🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍
So Ass dude hahahaha 😊
Don't like it at all. Too many pop, rap or whatever don't belong in country music. She needs some clothes on.
Why is she naked 🤮🤢💀☠️😡🙊
is that a street hooker costume?
Iose.   Bailar
2:43💖🤯🙌
Hahahahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
JoE BiDeN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

💩
I was curious to see how the dancing would be in the music video....😂
I know, we’ll put a banjo in & call it country! 🙄
Beyonce "How You Gonna Love Me" 🎤https://youtu.be/9dF1ZNoEwiw?si=0BFdyL7DQycqJZHQ
It's the simple things in life, eh
to many title to many country song. tossed together to try to make a country song  and not a good job at it at all   And we don't call our watering holes dive bars   That is a whole different thing  and we don't shot fake pew pews out of out fingers in our underpants to disgrace country music have nude
They want to be white so bad 😂

What the fuck ???!!! Great song but bad vidéo !!!!
✨BEYONCE GISELLE KNOWLES CARTER!!💜💙❤️__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Why did she look like seven😮 of nine in startrek
What a delusion! I think Beyonce thinks only about herself doing this video and not thinking to entertain people. Or maybe for the people to talk about this video.🤦‍♀️ I’m sure a lot of us forwarded the video directly to the end hoping that there are some changes at least at the end.😆
Too much repetition like c'mon
This video sucks honestly
She's got Marilyn Manson Mechanical Animals txts. Apparently YT approves. 😅 Too bad this music suxx.
Yes the video sucks
This ain’t Texas and this ain’t Beyoncé with this bullshit ass video. Do better
People who agree this song isn't country👇
Wth is this?

One of the worst songs I've ever listened in my whole life
You stick to pop not trying to be rude  but this song sucks

1:01 hi
LOLOLOLOLOL - This is such a joke.  LOLOL  My stomach hurts.  I had to look this up.  She thinks she is a country singer now?  LOLOL  I hear JayZ gave 21 million dollars to the radio station to play her country music and they refused.  I'm glad some stations still have integrity.  She isn't good at all.  Gross.
The hell was this video 😮😮
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Menuda castaña de video.... Con lo que promete un buen video con esa canción
She is so  sexy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Exactly who do you think you are milk stool baby and who was attacked six miles outside of Disney thirteen years ago so you could steal the leases I think not
IT FLOPPED 😂🗑️👎🏽
Why is she so down on Lexus's?
🌹🌹🌹
🙁 A horrendous video! ...and not because he does the exact same things all the time, but because he now reveals his absolute devotion, submission to his lucifer. You sold your soul for fame and money and you don't even seem repentant, what a bad thing... May Jesus have mercy on you.
Poor Beyonce, in her broken demented heart, sex bad girl is the only she knows how to sell.  Not country…
It is necessary topless? The outfit is terrible…is she a stripper in the video?
Complete GARBAGE, trash music from Beyonce, go away
VIDEO FREAKING WACK SONG DOPE
What a garbage song
And she looks ridiculous the whole get up is goofy the vest, no pants hideous glasses! She looks like lady Gaga if she got dropped in ho down! Smh just literally doesn’t make sense fr fr
This is the shittiest song I think she’s ever done! Country just isn’t for her!!
Terrible Video! Prefer to watch people dancin in the kitchen!
Link the case Am tried 😮😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤🎉
Truly one of the worst songs of all time.
Put some clothes on......
Beyoncé sang for the Weather channel! 😂
I CAN SMELL THE MATCH THAT LIT THE TORCH YOU THREW TEO HAD YOUR GUN BLUE GOTTA BE THE NEXT B. QUEEN FORGIVE ME A PRINCE IS ATTRACTED TO EVERY WOMAN HE SEE
This song is pure shit
Opening notes remind me of Gretchen Wilson’s Redneck Woman https://youtu.be/82dDnv9zeLs?si=G2FWKp-HCcPxtqn4
I pray this women get this Grammy to deny her talent is insane. I don’t trust ppl that don’t like Beyoncé. ❤❤❤❤
I think this is just a one hit wonder
😂😂😂 esperaba algo wow que decepción, ni lo termine de ver 😢
I passionately hate this song
Have some respect for yourself, put some clothes on!
Move back to your thing, not good, even with the titis and all that, nope, sorry. It’s a disrespect to country music, horrible, what is next? Showing ass?
Who is here after Eurovision ?!?
She is the devil
Heyyy it’s Franklin!
to inapropeit for kids
She is becoming whiter with time 🤢🤮🤮🤮
Love us our country music love us Beyonce love our 666😈😈😈
Seriously what do people not get about this is just a visualizer. It's not a music video.😅😂🤦🏽‍♀️
STOP MISREPRESENTING TEXAS!!! This SONG and  VIDEO is a LIE!!!
crazy this hack performed with prince LOL
If, Beyonce has nor personal /early life experiences, let alone, connections to Texas, she should leave Texas the hell alone, don't she know. . . "DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS , has alot of meanings. . . . I'll let fellow Texans chime in now. . . . .
Felipe Avello
Why is she naked can't watch it 😢😢
Good song but horrible video.
QUEEN OF MUSIC
Kann jemand erklären was das für ein Video ist und damit sehr viel Geld macht ihr ihr euch immer das gleiche Bild sehen müsst traurige Welt
I think I'm having a fit, or PTSD
Gross….this is entertainment? Jesus stars are desperate
😅😅😅 If the word "SUCKED" had a true definition this album would be it
😭🤣😂😂🤣😭😭😭😭🤣😂😂 you've got to be kidding, what a joke, as usual
I thought my car was squeaking because of the sound of crickets at the beginning of the song 🦗😶‍🌫️😩
Jakcet Off ah
No, No, No !!!!!
I love this🎉
Woooooooooooooooooooooo{oooooooooooooooooioooooooow
To all the people saying "its a visualiser" what the hell is a visualiser?? Is that the thing we're calling the little looped videos they use for Spotify or something? Can we call it something else given that "visualiser" is a generic word?
She only got into country music because she's a racist and wants to call out western stars. Watch. This will be her ONLY country album. She did it cuz she could. I can't understand the country stars who're giving her props. She's really dissing them.,...Stay in your own lane! No one's putting down the garbage that's supposed to be music - Rap!?! Music ???😢😮😂
This music sounds like some Indian song don’t know why
Such ridiculous music video 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ I thought I would find some good and great art but it wasn't 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
This aint texas
Chet song
Girl
I hate hate hate this song so much. It feels like diarrhea on my prom day. It feels like getting my period on a beach day. It's so sad. I told my grandma to hear this song and she said "Silence that sh!t or I will disconnect myself ". It's awful.   I just need to say this cuz I have never ever ever heard just a sad and depressive song
Date me please i like you please now for really like so hot
Date me please i like you please now for really like so hot

Eww. Beyoncé need to slow her role. Wannabe
Sie ist so schlau! Geniales Video 👍
This is horrible.   Seriously.   And I can't believe I hear little girls singing this garbage.
This is the song played at our school when transitioning like what???😂
Damn near broke the mouse smashing the like button!!
I don't know what to say is she just making money in country music 😂
I like about 45 seconds of this then I've had enough.

Keep supporting her and her husband more you do more children they can get a hold of for their child sex trafficking and much more
I love the vest, the song and she's looking gorgeous as always
Nice outfit
They ran out of ideas or what?
Your so cool my star ✨✨

Me encanta la canción, pero que decepción este video
Ale ma cyce 😍
This shit is not country music
My name is Texas whitsed
Beyonce on radio: This ain't Texa...  Me: Turns radio off and says " I'm not listening to that shit"
The cheapest video ever😂
Zo pak je lexus voor je kiezen mamma appelsap graag gedaan

Sono italiano ma amo questa canzone. Brava Beyoncé

I adore this song 🎵 ❤️
This ain't country she needs to stay with her own kind this music sucks stay off my  Playlist
Put some clothes on please!
Anyone else wish that Beyonce would just stay in her lane?

Me and my dad really hate this song
Love this ❤🎶🎵🎶👍🥰
This is embarrassing.  You tried darling, but you're not country.
Frank Zappa's don't go eating that yellow snow is the only other visualizer that comes close to this one. Well played Beyonce.
Oh yeah beoncee. Sing it girl. Love you my beloved King David!
My mummy always listens to your song he’s a big fan
We know those 2 fingers cumin up like that, we know what it's insinuating? Put ur stinky fingers back at your sides.
Like her song. BUT,  NOT her NASTY NESS. It NEEDS To STAY in POP !! Don't get me wrong, she HAS a GOOD voice. BUT, what she's wearing. And what she do. With her hand in another vid. ISN'T GOOD for KID'S to be Seeing. I'm open minded. BUT, there is a place for EVERYTHING and this type of act. ISN'T for Country music. It's more on a POP LEVEL than COUNTRY LEVEL. I like Beyonce and her Music. BUT, KEEP it CLEANER like ALL the OTHER COUNTRY Singers out there !! 👍🏼🙂
*Bravo à tous les gens qui font la chorégraphie country dans les shorts vidéos sur YouTube ! Vous êtes géniaux, même Beyoncé ne sait pas foulée pour le clip 🤭* _Un tube qu'on adore !_
NO.
This my grandma fav song
What a load of shite.
It sucked. She has no business singing country music
The hate she is getting for exploring country music is insane to me. Like her or not she is undeniably one of the most well-regarded, talented and relevant artists of the time and has been for an insanely long time. The respect she has for music is undeniable as well. She didn't just jump into country either. She took the time to research the history of country and has really put so much energy, care and love into this genre. She sounds amazing! 😍
How can people hate on her doing country with THAT VOICE! Dang she's pleasant to listen to. Do your thang, B! 🔥
Love this song. My workout treadmill favorite.
thats not country
This has to be the lames piece of crap I've ever heard.
Scratch in out my fuc 🌽 toe ty Dolla sign  Payment attention promotion in ❤🎉😮
Bet on the games 🎮 football or fowls 😮😮😮❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Ain't no - double negative
Ewwwwww cover up have some respect for yourself!
Sorry Beyoncé, but you cannot mix pop music with a southern accent. This isn’t country music
love her ❤❤❤❤❤
DEMON
All Seeing Eye Symbolism
OMG that's awful
Gross
Love dis😊
I love this song
Well that was disappointing 😞
Worst video ever. It would be great if there was a video around a countryside, travelling around with a kids and a dog in the car.
What a shit song
Absolutely pathetic dribble.
✨
At her age she should put some clothes on 😮
Why is she have naked?
Pin me if i said it right  This aint takes
Yes Sir 🎶🎶🎶🎙️🔊🔊😎 Ladies Hour Thursday 11pm Music 🎶🎶
Mediocre song, even more mediocre video. Who thought this was a great idea?
Omg... I've seen it all now... Beyonce trying to be country... Country girls don't have to show half their body to be good.... Beyonce you are Beyonce stay in your lane country is not your style.
She needs to stop trying to do country music, she's trash at it and she needs to stay in her lane
Why is she dressed so sleazy?  This song absolutely sucks.
Awesome
Hey it's Franklin 😅
This Song is bs fck them 4 making this trash
Why is there so many haters maybe that's Y..  Beyonce did it always will love this beautiful amazing woman. . End of discussion everybody's got an opinion and that's mine
Beyonce: I look hot as s$$t in that take. Just use that on a loop.  Producer: Are you shure? Beyonce: with one hand on her hip, did you actually watch that clip?
Man momma, I thought I was Brain Stuck on Stock but this song came and I was horsing on my surfing board towards the beach sand.😎
So stupid
AMERICAN SONG?
This is the character that’s gonna hit Jolene ass 😂😂😂
❤❤❤
Worst song I have to hear at work in al long time
Burn this song 👍😃
Vulgaire, rien ne vaudra Taylor Swift
Why she didn't have dance to go with the song on video
People that see here tits  👇
🇵🇱
Wow i haven’t watched the video till now and it looks like my inner intuition was  definitely right i used to like that song and imagined her with cowboy hat jeans dancing a lot etc but she is saying it This ain’t Texas i couldn’t watch it just rewind it 😂
Joke lol
My #pupinatruck literally sings this 😊
to say she has three kids looking good
Garbage!
Anything to distract the human robots
Disappointing 👎👎👎
WoW I lova ❤
she can do county better then 99% of so called county singers
I keep hearing she’s no country singer, but it’s not too Bad, maybe if the video had some plot to it, it would probably add some Diversity?
Dumbest unsexy video for her, you'd think her brain was working when they came up with this idea, but I suppose her brain was on pause
Look at the barrels on that one
I love the song, but this video they could have done so much better like having some cowboys and cowgirls dancing to it.
⚡
Wow is this really what it's come to
This is TRASH
I NEVER have this much success with tit tape 🤦🏻‍♀️
😂 Me thinking the video is different and cool but its just Rhianna
This is rubbish, seriously pathetic.
She forgot to wear a bra. 😢

Sorry but, Madonna did Country music better than you ever could. Reference : Don't Tell Me. No contest. Go home. Please.
To me this isn’t real country and it’s a overrated song
Am i watching a glitch video 😂
Horrible video
Me bolbi loca Mirando Este video!  Me aguinaba Algo mas😂😂😂😂  Buena cancion😂😂😊
She is the best country singer ever love her so screw everyone who likes to talk trash!!!  Ginger cranor
She needs to give it up
Talented lady❤❤
Like beyoncie but why is her outfit so sleezy Sad she better than that😢
I love it I usually don’t like Beyoncé I’m impressed
I liked the song but the way she is dressed is definitely not country
she su*ks just saying
This song is awful
Yalls mad as at her bc yall is country and she used to be pop so pls just liston to them reql music
Watched Modern Family recently. Wish I could see Cam’s reaction to Beyoncé’s country album!
put a fucking shirt on, these people....
Symbolism at it's best
Did Diddy say they all worship the evil guy downstairs? 😮 they all crazy but I do like this song despite their personal choices in faith / worship.
AGRED! Who's the art director on this piece of shit? Doesn't do her any justice...wardrobe? What's that robotic thing on her eye? Texas Hold em is a poker game! What's the whistlin' about. Big mistake.😮
Me the whole time:put some clothes on girl
Rubbish video
What the hell is this she is doing nothing but walking and blowing her fingers in  pantyhose and a leather vest 🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷
🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Beyonce,  Here's what we have to do!  Fire Kane Brown from American music industry immediately, because he can't sing.   He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.  There were many country singers who tried to help him out so that he could stay in country music business, but he failed every time.  He just can't sing and sounds hideous!      Chris Young, Hardy, Blake Shelton, Marshmello, Khalid, H.E.R., John Legend and Lauren Alaina (Not a singer just American Idol contestant loser): almost every country singer tried to work with him, but failed.  No future for that dude.
I don't care.  The song is great
God I can’t stand this song. 93.3 FLZ has this damn song on repeat 😒. You saying Woooo, Hey, Ohhhh in your songs doesn’t make you a country Artist 🤷🏼‍♂️😂. Please stick with your genre of music 🤷🏼‍♂️😂.

Sad to see Beyonce has gone the stripper route also. All just about sexuality now. Sad.
I was right no country singer dress like that stick with your music good song.
Shaboozy is better than this  👇🏽
,stopped @56 seconds and realize I got tired of her repeating herself.
Girls been playing this all day everyday 😂
"i have breasts therefore i am". (ancient minoan inscription). queen bey rules. the future is female.❤ in my century we called that built like a brick shithouse.
My daughter's bffs teacher played this for the students bc ut was stuck in hwr head
I mean the video says visualizer not music video so technically it is what it says
This ain't country
Laziest video ever.
Smh
Oe que de la merde pour une chanteuse 0:27
Oe que de la merde pour une chanteuse
De la merde
Don't nor never have cared for her.....but this is actual dogshit
Culture vulture
It is too inappropriate
I came here after seeing millions of people naming this song as the one theyd like to have deleted from history and never heard again. I concur, this is absolute shite.
I don't get why people hate it so much, it's literally as bad as every other pop song it doesn't stand out from the usual trash
song sucks
when i heard this song in like every second tiktok i assumed it was some old classic resurfacing, it just sounds so familiar
Shits trash. 🚮
This video is totally ridiculous. Nothing country about it at all. Trashy? Definitely but not country.
This ain’t no damn country song. She need to go back to the other side😒
Worse country song I ever heard. You can tell her heart is not in it. It sounds so bland. And I don't understand how people like it.

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So. Westworld robot?
I really can't fault people for liking this as well its disposable as 93.765% of current music.
The banjo and guitar players fell asleep 30 seconds into the song.
Just some years ladies don't need top anymore
Why she gotta be cursing like that
Sure wish Lainey Wilson had a recorded this song ❤
One eye - iluminati
Song fucking sucks
For the love of God 🤦‍♀️- this is bad!!!!

Is this looping worst music video ever but Beyonce is looking good 😂
Worst video concept of all time. But brilliant marketing. Come for the music, stay for the nipslip potential.
What a lazy piece of crap this video is, and the song is not much better.
She's gone country look at them boots. She's gone county back to her roots. She's gone county a new kind of suit. She's gone county...here she comes
When did Beyonce become so bad
Wow.  Pathetic
This is "Sun Darts" in real life.
This song is so fucking bad lol
Low budget...Jay-Z spent all the $$$ on radio play for this shit song.
Is there an encrypted message in this gig?
not country
#stupid
tiddiezzz
I'll try to keep my eyes closed
Pure trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Low budget video 😂😂
This video is... Surreal. Ridiculously removed from reality. Bizarre..
Lol… No wonder all them country singers walked out 😂 lol 😂
This song is good I like this song
When you’re to old for this shit and have no moves left…
Terrible.  And I'm white and hate country music
You should get Album of the Year now with Country RandB A CRAB artist first ever 📀
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 she need to fix her clothes before she sings
Now that I've heard it, I can share my opinion. Way worse than I expected. I wanted to disagree with the haters so bad. But nooooo!

I've never been a fan can't stand her voice but I like this song not the video
She is 🔥!!
Awww. Does anyone else remember when Beyonce was good ?
Pure trash
❤❤
This is wrong on so many levels, apart from the bad taste and terrible writing.  Seems stolen from the ‘Franklin’ theme song, besides
If you cant see the illuminati signs she's wearing then you're blind
Hi Beyoncé

Uumm—-I did not expect to so much of Beyoncé in this video and I’m sorry the music didn’t hold me other,. So, no vote from me.
Beyoncé:  The black Madonna.  Using skin to stay relevant.
Bring the Ho into country! Whhhy???😂😮😢
Remix !!! https://youtu.be/pXZfN8OKnNw?feature=shared
https://youtu.be/-sbBD96_31M?si=JzSEJizv00VI59iL   Beyonce is not country and neither are most of her delusional followers. Most of her music sucks. What does she sound like without autotune?
So sexy
I hate🤮  I don't know how this can be someone's favourite song haha
I love this song ❤
Okay to be clear it ant contrey it like a love story from texas

😂😂😂😂😂😂.... Lady needs to stay in her lane...
Horrible in my opinion.
WTF is this???     What?  Her and J run out of ideas or what??    Time forever lost.
❤❤❤❤❤
This is the WORST ATTEMPT AT COUNTRY MUSIC! GIRL! Stay in your lane!
Bro this isn't country this is a disgrace to anything that is even associated with country
She’s nasty looking dressed so scantily
She gave it a good try. It was definitely hell for her boobs were out the whole time
Beyonce knows nothing of Texas or country she's just a good vocalist from the Streets
Was she assimilated by the Borg? She seems to have a Seven of Nine thing going on.
She is just doing the same thing over again, bro
Horrible.
How's her after hearing shaboozy a bar song 😢
Illuminati puppetmaster the hidden eyes and half.nudity says it all!
The video puts me off the song altogether now ,thank beyonce but no thanks .
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
It’s more country than most current country music.
Do it without the jacket
This ain’t country. This Sucks ass
😂😂😂😂 dam that sucks dirty balls 😂😂😂😂
Where is that Texas dance we came in to see from Bronco Texas Beyonce? This visualization lacks substance.
❤❤❤❤❤👏👏🧿🧿
Why does  she  have  her  boobs out
Why is she not singing,  and why does she have to be halfway naked
Song sucks.
The song has so much potential for a cool music video and that’s what they came up with…. Wow…. Sad.
Tipsy is better
My GOD she IS the Queen
Horrible
yall realize it said visualizer and not music video?
That was the worst!
country music is sooooo boring!!
just did a cover of this song on my youtube channel and IT'S ACTUALLY KINDA HARD TO SING AT SOME PARTS. I'm shocked! Beyonce is a GEM! always love her songs
Can I see under the bra
I’m embarrassed for her for that outfit. She doesn’t need to do that.
BORING
37M .....?
We don't wanna see boobies, show us your tractor fr.
I love this song🎉
De donde sacaron los pasos ????
Just no... Stay in your lane bey
another reason more why i dislike silicones
Le donne vogliono avere più diritti e vogliono avere la parità dei sessi però alla fine fanno sempre i video vestite da pornostar.. sì va bene ha i soldi Ma questo video fa pena
Is that country ? Us are lost😢
Trying yo to figure out the plate on her face
Be ok if she wore actual clothes.
this shit sucks ass
She went country? Wtf kind of country is this
Stop hating she’s a beautiful black queen with gifts
Go head on Beyoncé you eat ‘em up
Its sounds more like Country Gospel.      Not bad!
What the fuck I don’t love this fucking song and trend and sound 💩
Schönes Lied, langweiliges Video
Like the song, Haye the video. Too crass
Gospel😂
Crazy to think 6 people wrote this song…

Visualizer or not...still looks ridiculous; like she's the Ghouls' gf from fallout.

Bah... c'est quoi ce clip ?! Pas assez de budget pour les vêtements ? La fonction loop c'est parce qu'ils avaient la flemme ?
I never liked Beyonce, until I heard this track.
This song marks the start of a new music genre: I call it; Tryhard Music EDIT: Just wanted to point out how she COMPLETLY STOLE THE MUSIC FROM THAT FRANKLIN THE TURTLE KIDS SHOW!!!
Are you still walking naked granny.? Get dressed and embrace Islam before it's too late
Is the whole video her doing that??
I love All types of music and this is a horrible song
Great song and she totally nailed it but dont unerstand the vid.
Keke wyat has a countrysong called lie under you 8 years now
I dont like beyonces music but I like this song🤘
This shit is garbage
I love her because she aint fake or anything abuslute gorg for her age <3
Why is she dressed like that, they say her album is breaking records, what's this world coming to
tig biddies
Beyoncé come to Met Gala 2024 pleaseee ❤🙏🏽💅🏽
This shit slaps on mute 🗣️🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🗣️
Enough with the hate comments. Y’all don’t realize what a visualizer is… This song and visualizer is legendary ❤
Um Awful video... Sorry my Queen it's no Telephone.
I like the song but this ain't country music 🤷🏾‍♀️
For Gods sake cover your breasts, influencing impressionable young girls, what a poor example. Just  sing.
😢🎉❤
Songs not too bad, but I don’t think they would invite her to the grand ol  Opry  dress like that
Untied state is not texas 0:31
Don’t be a bitch 😂❤🎉 tha Shit 0:54
Yall seem to think “visualizer” and “complete music video” are the same thing….😅 I do not believe that’s the case lmao
I love this song. Some of the country music these days is terrible and stupid. This song is definitely country. Beyoncé has always been a country girl. She still has her southern accent. Whoever is casting her out A) hasn’t listened to the whole song. The banjo was awesome. She actually sang about southern things not some stupid country pop song like these dudes. Miranda lambert vibes. I’m white and I love her and I am happy she did this bc this needed to happen to bring the haters out. When a black man came out in country they didn’t care. A black woman does its an issue?
very bad video
This is the worst song in the history of human life.
This shit AINT Country!
This song is so garbage , I’m not understanding
❤❤❤❤
Yea…no.. this is awful.
Next time, just come out naked.   Sad
Seemed a simple video production.
JZ is a very blessed husband.
This video makes no sense. Catchy tune.
This just plan sucks no wonder people are making videos for her
This SUCKS!!
Wait.  This is real?  Not a joke?
This has to be the worst music video I have ever seen in my entire life. Absolutely absurd and trashy. Disgusting
This song sucks. What does this racist ɓīťçĥ know about country!
That film clip must have cost them heaps!
Flopped.
I have never seen such a horrible video clip.
This song is exactly what people who dont listen to country say all country is. She through a few random things into a song and hopped for the best. Theres no story. Theres no soul. A tornado and texas holdem and dive bars???? Tf you talking about
Nice song, but the outfit is 0/10
Oh put some clothes on woman.
This not good 😒
The song is great, but the video is a disaster!
Awful "musician" floats between genres because she ain't good with any genre.  Awful voice.  This is not country.
Munnezz ❤
No Brasil está sendo um sucesso 🔥🙏🎼🎶
Ma mi potete spiegare come una artista meravigliosa come Beyoncé ci fanno questo video  che fa' vedere sempre la stessa cosa per tutta la durata della canzone? Grazie
what is the flow? and how can one be taken to it?
Il top
Stupenda veramente ❤❤❤❤❤
Tacky from A to Z
Horrible song
Ain't no Texas, ain't no country song
Iereen aan is je aan het aanbieden. Mag ik iets aso zo zeggen? Hoe kan het om zoveel kracht op te brengen Wat een kanjer en wat een kracht! 🙏🏽 Respect!!!
Talk about a completely overrated singer who by no means is breaking any records the music she copies or produces is completely trash facts
Ok hdhfkfj6emduemd73j2
Ok so I chanced upon the actual music video 😊  https://youtu.be/ycwtqqhV6UE?si=at7PtlI_vpwkL2dL
You already excelled in the area you were in so stay there quit trying to be soooo diverse you know what works for you and you know what doesn’t and this is one area you should reconsider
lol this is not country music please stop
Goes hard on mute 🔥🔥
This is the worst. It's not country just because you throw in a banjo and a hoedown. Dumbest video ever too.
Sounds like the the theme song to that turtle cartoon Franklin
Okay so I have been listening to a lot of country music and the problem with what Beyonce's doing here is the stuff that she's talking about has no integrity at all. Country music is much deeper than the shallow stuff she's talking about here in this song. Country music is full of deep integrity add very wholesome values none of which are displayed here in this song
Check out my dance choreo for this song.
Hahahahaha 🤣 how crap is this 😂 she can't sing country  You'll never win a Grammy award
You get a 👍, and you get a 👍 Every comment who shits on this sham sold opry deserves more validation than this bigtidded cringe
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Her shit just keeps getting more n more shitty, nasty,and cheap
That is by far the stupidest video ever...
Beyoncé is the best better than Taylor swift
I LOVE IT.
Cringe as fuck
This is the lest country thing I’ve ever seen
You ain’t even country Beyoncé 😂
i really hate to say this but this is probably the worst song i've ever heard from her and i have been a fan of her music for many years since her time as part of Destiny's Child.
❤❤❤🥰
She looks ridiculous.
Cover it up Mommy.
The intro is just stupid.
Lame ass song
I love Beyonce but why is she over here disrespecting country sorry but not sorry her country is not good and it's messing everything up I don't even know if I could even call it country it's not even close to it
Fuk I hate this song.. just came here to say that 😅
Hey Bey! I Parodied your song 😊
that is not country
I like the song, but worst video ever!
Bo-fckn'-ring we're going to be tortured with this sh!t garbage all summer
She should stay away from country music for real
She shows no class as a country singer. You've never seen Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton etc. ever dress so provocative in any videos I'm sorry to say but this was a disgrace to country music
Billig
Tacky
Are you kidding me!! Girl don’t even claim Texas
Never heard of an official visualizer🙄 dumbest thing ever.
Am I the only one who don't understand this video at all??
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" dropped 26 spots to #31 for its 11th week on the Billboard Hot 100! "Cowboy Carter" dropped 1 spot to #3 for its 4th week! keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! 👑🐝🤠
Toll ,einfach Toll 😂❤
That's Not  County  like  Really
The song is great, but what's the point of this video? Is Beyonce now too good to make a proper music video? Especially with country, you could make such an awesome video.
No no no
Genial..
Musik genisl
2024....anyone😢?
Just give up already👎🏼
Wouldn’t be surprised if she was TOLD to write this song. It’s just bad.
The fretless banjo playing adds so much to the song!!! The original banjo was designed and made by the African American slaves and their banjos had a violin like head stock and yes they were fretless. The banjo of today is fretted and some southerner filed the patent on it, but credit should go to the African American Slaves and the original banjo they invented. So I thank them and every time I hear hear a banjo playing, it makes me! History is about the truth!
Absolutely love Beyonce!!! ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️😃😃😃🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰♥️🥰
Que tragédia, até quem faz uso desta música no tiktok ficou melhor
Ok, I cant stand this. Bye
This is NOT country music. Stay in your lane Beyoncé. It’s not even a good song in any genre.
Wow.. wtf is this .. stick to your ghetto rap...
Same
I hope and pray our children have not seen this video. Rated XXX
I was on my Harley the other day flying down the road with country music in my ear. Suddenly, the next song was this trash. I pulled over faster than I have ever pulled over on my bike. This song does not even remotely sound like country music. Stay in your f****** Lane chick. Absolute trash
Thank u❤
azz.......fatto in casa per VOI !!!!   annamo a risparmio.....
Park your Lexus
Producer: Just show your t**s that enough.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Is this pornography or what, it must be absolutely rubbish if a performer has to be pretty much naked to sell the song. Before I saw the video I was happy to listen to the song now it's not a vision I want to remember when I hear the song. Come on why don't you just trust your music as being good without such a obvious visual exhibition of selling your nakedness.
Does she not know black youth have a crime issue, wonder how she’s giving back to America 🤢
She’s sold her soul
3:49 Solargenic photogenic shoot- (Dies while shoot)
Sex sells.
so GIF is kind a weird
If a white woman did this, the comments wouldn't be full of weird people saying the song sucks
It's a visualizer
Hand pew pew is kicking the
what is this catching song, weird revealing outfit and the dance is on loop
The worst videoclip I have ever seen !!
This is horrible, stick to pop
faith hill 聴きたくなった😏😏
Perfect tts doesn't exi- Beyonce: please
At this point her and Jay Z need to pull a Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain move and see who can survive a heroin induced game of Russian Roulette.
Wow..just another person trying to steal an genre..and art....formmm...a culture! U ARE NOT COUNTRY!

Absolutely.‼️❣️‼️❣️‼️💕‼️❣️‼️❣️ A❤️W❤️E❤️S❤️O❤️M♥️E Black Country Music
😢 this song sucks this is not country you need to find something else to do
You forgot your bra
Horrible!
❤😂❤😂
Right on Beyoncé 💪🏼
Beyonce: "I have 50 cents in my purse" Producer: "Let me grab the visualizer"
Wow a song of hers I actually and I don't even like country. Tbh I think she she sounds better like this
She not county
Beyonce!!! We want to watch music video of this song. Please...🙏😌
Forget all the extra wording, its simple. I don't like it.
Music?
This song reminds me of The Wacky World of Tex Avery for some reason
What a pig
ZERO SEX ZERO NUDITY ZERO DRUGS ZERO TALENT
Double sided tape holds her top just right....fab
All the geniuses in the comments can’t read that this is a VISUALIZER not a music video😂
I hate this fucking ssing
She is not a country singer
This song isnt even country its a sad excuse of one it includes curse words which most country songs dont have and it doesnt have the beat of one
I'm loving this but why does it keep playing the same thing over again.
I love this song😂❤❤💜💜✊🏿💜🎉👢
this is fuckin ass who made this shit
This blows, yes she can walk and click a fake gun. So!
She only had to do the move once😂.  Guess she was in a hurry.   What a stupid and strange  vid 🙄
I naught canna believe mine eees, iiiis. Is this the sweet sound oncorn o cobs shucketh!
This song got me about 0.00 to know th🤣s song
Best song ever
This shit is ass
damn gurl!  said enuf
This shit ass wtf😭
K but why does this sound like the Franklin theme song😂😂😂
This is the worst song I have ever heard in my entire lifetime on this god forsaken planet
Dislike button
Love this song but she should dress modestly
the most expensive music video ever...
This might be the worst song ever made
Fr
fuckn worst song yo😮
🌸
This entire album feels like when a rich person is bored and begins deluding themselves into thinking they can do anything at a high level.  Her country music is pure ass plain and simple.  It's really embarrassing to be honest.
No no no....Great example for your daughter....!! Stick to your usual music genre Bey..C&W not for you. Loved everything before..but not this !
Sorry can't have a twang beat with something that sounds more like a rap lyrics this just don't work.
Haha this ain't country 😅
Nah this ain’t it.
As a real texan myself, I can speak on behalf of all of Texas when I say, we do not claim this song, and have no affiliation with Beyoncé and demonic influence
German radio is currently busy raping my ears with this crap on repeat
How the fuck this shit has so many views. There ain’t no talent at all in that song. Shitty lyrics, shitty beat, shitty flow, just pure garbage.
Y'all are haters. Yeah it might be weird hearing her doing Country, but it's catchy ❤❤ I kinda like it
Cultural appropriation
This is a big shit 🤢🤢🤢
This song is awful.
Hate it
😤 divertido vídeo
Song makes no sence. Garbage
This is not country. Just like all the country songs today, it's pop.
They were trying to make art but this video is a fail. A choreographed line dance woulda been cool
Who’s still listening in 2024
Came here for the car crash meme hahahahah
One eye covered and she’s doing the Baphomet as above, so below hand symbolism.
Texas be like 👀
i fucking hate this song
You clearly can tell she’s run out of ways to reinvent herself weak ass country song
Spent time in Texas. Love the place, love the song, love the singer
She should have made sure her boobs were even if she was going to wear that vest thing.
This shit is the worst, my volume down button is getting used hard!
One of the dumbest music videos I've seen in a while 🤦
Girl you need jesus
👎👎👎
Hate this song
No like , sounds like a Macy's comercial
I don't even know who this is
but can we please help our kids
Shit goes hard on mute 🗣💯🥶🔥
is it just me or is this song kanda racist?
I wish YouTube hadn't removed the "dislike" number. This video has to take the cake. Is this what Los Angeles thinks country is?
Good song.  It deserves a music video.  Not...whatever the fuck this is.
❤ karma is only a bitch  B if you ARE  hot 🥵 in here x
Truth be told that shit ain’t pretty  passing time 🕰️
❤😂❤
So she took country to a trash place . My ears wouldn't listen to more then 20 seconds before they started to bleed
I am too distracted by the visualizer to pay attention to the song
here we are 2 months later and the white ppl are STILL mad in the comments lol....... keep making the views go up....
Trash
Ain’t no way people still listen to this old piece of shit And it’s still popular like what the fuck
what a dog shit song
Ugh. This song sucks
This is utter crap
Yoooooooo this is straight fire! Put it out‼️🔥🗣️💯💯
sick liberal
🤣🤣🤣 no
WHERE IS YOUR SHIRT😭😭💀💀💀👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
This aint country, somebody cue David Allen Coe.
Trash
There is no God damn way. This youtuber is the fucking worst ever.
Aint no way people listen to this piece of shit And A lot of old people play It. 😒
Like si le diste Zoom.
OMG WORST VIDEO EVER!!! WTActual F!!!
Learn to make good songs and not country
This aint country🤣 shits ass
My lady is a savage at music
Why even bother with clothes the f*ck is this
Why r her t's out tho 💀☠️💀
Ok, just listened to this song and what is all the fuss about????  The background singers did the most work and Beyoncé sounds just like her usual self, mediocre 😆
It an”t texes
Really weird video.
This has to be the most horrible song I've ever heard!!
Why is it the same thing over and over again?
Borring i have think in this video she is on a 🐎 or on a Western pharm
I’m cracking up & dying from laughing   She done lost her mind 😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣
À tout les français des années 1990 svp, le début de la chanson ne vous fait il pas penser au générique de Franklin la tortue? 😂
Beyoncé is the best ever 😍😍😍
Can any country be clean this is just trashy
Stripper or singer??
What the hell was she thinking!?
Do guys play roblox
And I just said when has Beyonce ever been in a dive bar I just question that one part
What a joke 🤡
Texas hold em this ain’t nut thang hoe down
This SHYT IS TERRIBLE 😂
❤❤❤❤ Bey soundz like a modern day Dolly Parton
Make a Bavarian song  Beyonce.
She is very sexy
Horrible, she needs to stick to R &B... she just doesn't cut as a country singer...
Che figa pazzesca
Average Joe Biden listeners
It’s not even a country song it don’t even sound like it no thanks
Beyonceeeeee i love you so muchhhhhhh ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ground hog day ??????
Why she feels the need to show her boobs when having such a fabulous voice is beyond me.But maybe i'm oldfashioned.
I would've loved to see her dance in this video. 👀
Sehr schlechtes Video!! 👎 Hab mir mehr erwartet...die Nachahmer machen definitiv beeindruckende Video als war Sie da darstellt! 👎
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who’s listing to this In 2016?🎉
Worst song EVER
She half naked like cop on lads a small bit
It seems like nobody truly likes this song. They just like Beyonce
So, no hold hold down on your dress either?  Is this a  country song ?
🆘🛟Producer: I am real savvy with saving money, and we lost everything but the takes of B walking out and shooting her hand 🔫… so I’m just gonna edit all the takes together and add a flare and smoke. Tik Tokers get away with it allll the time, so why can’t we?  BECAUSE IT’S BEYONCÉ- NO BUDGET BEYONCÉ, SIR.👁️👄👁️  Oops we already released it.🤦🏾‍♀️
This is perfect for a roadtrip
Trash
Seriously ugly outfit
So many people in this comment section are spending their attention on things that make them mad. Why though? Waste of time.
J’adore incroyable
Shite video
Thats the laziest fckin video I have ever seen. Talk about just can’t be bothered.
Hit like if you think this song sucks and is NOT country music.
Ofcourse she can't make a video without occult shit...what a waste of time and oxygen
Still grinding girl, jay z makes you look average
Cost saving song, 0 spending, Millions of earning.
Ewwwww this is awful.She is so over rated.Yeah she can shake her t&a but that's all she has.
It's brilliant 💃
I’m only here take make sure y’all have a dislike button 👎
it fits in nicely.
Most overrated singer of the century, just was at the right place at the right time and married the right person too, and loves showing her body to sell shit. Absolute garbage of a song just like most of her other stuff.
Apparently, you have no idea about country music and its traditions. You don't call and ask to be invited to the Opry. The ones who do that call the person they want and it ain't you. George Strait said just because you dress country doesn't make you country. Reba won't sing a song with you because it is not country. Aldean, Underwood and Lambert have canceled appearances because you were going to be there. You need to get out of the country and back into whatever they are now calling your type of music. People  have made it clear you are not wanted in country music.
Oops I tought it was a video and song from the 90s or the 2000s😅
Ariana ended this old h@g.
damn it's petfect
Okay… I gave it a go. Cute lol perhaps.  But i wouldn’t consider this “Top …whatever” . Keep be an artist.
Sorry but I can't get past the outfit. I'm not a fan of half naked women singing country songs...or any songs for that matter. What are you trying to prove. Please, go join a strip club or a burlesque. Plus,  the song just does not sound the same to me without Kenny Rogers voice. Sorry B fans...I'm not one!
The stupidest music video I’ve ever seen
I like the song, but the video sucks!!
Idk
U were the first get caught by the best! Hands up! Bidi bidi <3
💩💩
This is trash
TRAAASSHHH
I expected much more ... very disappointing 😕
Dayum this shit is horrible!!!!!!!
I wish this 55+ year old woman wasn't naked.
Lmao hell no she needs to stick to her type music!
Aburridoooo
This video IS WAYYYYY worse than I thought 😂
Jay-Z and Beyoncé are the fed’s
Beyonce,  Here's what we have to do!   Fire Kane Brown from American music industry immediately, because he can't sing.   He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.  There were many country singers who tried to help him out so that he could stay in country music business, but he failed every time.  He just can't sing and sounds hideous!      Chris Young, Hardy, Blake Shelton, Marshmello, Khalid, H.E.R., John Legend and Lauren Alaina (Not a singer just American Idol contestant loser): almost every country singer tried to work with him, but failed.  No future for that dude.
I can't even....
First time hearing it.its good
Well it is and don't be talking about her like that she's just a girl I know you don't have a girlfriend so don't be talking boy what the hell happened on
Country?????!!!!!  Fill up my glass & kiss my ass
Left eye symbolism right in your Face. People wake up!!!!
#demonseed
Why do american women have to be half naked in making a song video?
I'm thinking the same old thing!!
I am sorry she sucks. You bring the person out of the getto but getto out of  her. Lines are so silly and empty.. Maybe JC will thinks is the best video too😂😂
This is absolute garbage! Shes not country what so everm this flopped just like it should.
Bescheuertes Video zu einem Countrysong....
😂😂😂, lmao 💀 ☠️ 🤣..
“This ain’t Texas”?  This ain’t country.
beyonce is such a beautiful singer she really does have to do this half naked crap  to sell her song im sorry but that outfit is ugly
If it ain't got Mama, trains, or trucks it probably $ucks
Great song shit video
Y’all been hypnotized and you don’t even know it
phew! no wardrobe mulfunction this time
Love this song. Like the lyrics
Beyonce is Music genius 😍
Alia madame Kalam
Im sure there is some devil message behind this garbage
I'M italian,i love your Song This is beautiful😍
Ca change de son repertoire, j'adore trop
It's not country. Don't wanna hear no bullshit arguments
This is the first visualizer I ever saw and I got to say, I don’t see the point.
Who knew Franklin (the cartoon) was country!
This is so ridiculous  not even country  it's the worst
Why is her things out
this is not country.
Damon you fine asf fuck u jayz she mine
What a great song by a great artist!!!
As so is above, so is below😢
2:19 I believe it was to hot to think straight given that outfit
This song reminds me of magic school bus 🚌  “wheels go round round round round round”
Stop playing dress up  You ain’t country
🤔 cultural appropriation guess it's one rule for one and another for everyone else don't go complaining "whites" are taking "your" music genres and then go do a country song stick to Motown and rnb it's what you're good at this is absolute trash and insulting to the greats wearing next to nothing pathetic attempt at being something your not
Not me wearing Nike pros and a crop top to the yard 😅
Where has real county outfits gone 😢
Put some clothes on 🙈🙈🙈
Love the song.
Heard her man paid off a lot of country radio stations to play this crap over and over just so she can get #1.  The narcissism those two have is beyond comprehension
People seriously like this trash ass song. It's not even country!!! Lmfao. I used to like her, but now absolutely not!!!
The Illuminati Queen
Oh wow, what trash
Love video❤
this music video is a GIF
What a disappointment of a video 😢
Hearing this song makes me really sick🤢🤢🤢
She don’t even sound right singing country
Disappointing that in a time of world wide abuse against women-sexual abuse being a big player in this-an Awsome country song would be sexualised like this! What a video to show children! I loved this song, but cannot respect this in any way!!!
Cheapest video ever made, and total shit.
Trash in every respect
This sucked
She needs to stop right here right now your not country never will be Beyonce GTFOH
Catchy AF. lt makes me happy and want to dance. I love it <3
Ta nouvelle chanson est géniale ❤
He so sexy 💀
May God have mercy on her soul .
The fact y’all don’t know what a visualizer is, is* kinda funny 😭
This is so stupid and disgusting.
i just got told this clip has a song attached ?
Just came here to dislike ❤️
Tune is boring as fk. This video same😴
just a reminder this isnt one bit country music
Aint got nothing better to do so you make this piece of shit music, only deaf people enjoy this
This song is stupid
Shitty song
Dumbest crap I’ve see in awhile. That’s saying a lot.
Her voice is ok, she cannot write songs, she ruined Jolene.
Beyonce sucks
Why she got her tities out
THIS is why space aliens will eventually exterminate us.
Boring song, trashy video
literally EVERYONE I know hates this song how tf it got 35mil views 😭😭. Worst song and tbh she’s 🗑️
Ghetto country , with curse words ! Yay.....
섹시 💋 예쁘시네요 ‘’
What the actual fuck is this?
I'm gonna say it.... hate me if you like...... This song sucks and the video is lazy.   Her R&B music is great though.
I'm getting this song!
Yuck
Y’all trippin, this song is a bop💃🏽🕺🏼
This isn't actual country but I like it
❤❤❤❤❤😂
Bots in the chat lol i dont know anyone who likes this song
Sorry but she’s literally just copied the 2000’s theme tune for This Is Franklin!!! Listen to the theme tune then listen to this scam of a song. Her first county song and it’s stolen 😂😂😂
I came here to do a Hate comment
I want to gouge my eardrums out
https://youtu.be/UXxDpiAVrdU?si=RFpq78Dji4SWg5h2
Over and over is a mix.  But it really is pure musical artistic genius.  She took a chance going with country.  And She did it well.  In her own way. And it’s taking the world by storm.  Bravo!  And Cyrus too the music world by storm recently with her songs also.  And we don’t need to mention Taylor Swift.  All these young ladies are icons.  Just like Whitney Houston,  Dolly Parton,  Donna Summer, Loretta Lynn,  Gloria Gaynor, and a few more.  All pure talent
yup
Disguting
Would hands down listen to more "my boyfriend sucks" Taylor Swift song over whatever this was supposed to be.
Linda maravilhosa
This woman isn't Aretha, Whitney, Tina, Gladys, Patti, or any of the celebrated divas!  She is BEYONCE a true DIVA in her own way, right, and style!  Greatness comes in many ways......
Disney Texas
Why’s blud naked?
Et c'est Franklin !!! 😂
Disgusting!
I was in a coma for 10 months. They played this song in the hospital and I woke up for the soul purpose to turn that shit off. Never make country again.
She's incredible!👏👏👏👏 Great song!
"Music videos are art" Music videos:
Her implants look good still not country
The music sounds alot like "late July" by Shaky Graves.
Gay
Omymy goodness you keep gettin it ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉 I’m with you!! Break those barriers
Vid suck like the song😂
This is fuckin shit
Listen8ng to these lyrics I feel like she's making fun and mocking real country music. That's how bad this music and her lyrics are. Guarantee this woman's never been to a dive bar or a Ho-down
I like this song!
Why is it necessary to have your boobs hanging out and swear? That doesn't make it country. That doesn't add anything to a potentially good song.
You have nothing on Sierra Ferrell, or country, nfg.
I loveeeeeee...you😢😢😢😢😢😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
Zzzzzzz
I loveeeeeee...you😢😢😢😢😢😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
SHEIS NOT A COUNTRY MUSIC ARTIST .........JUST GO THE FCUK AWAY !!!
Why would she try country?
What a joke....BOOOOOOOO!!!!
This aint Texas but this is garbage.
Yeah nah I’m good. It almost sounds AI generated. This ain’t your vibe girl. Stay in your lane lol mad respect you’re an incredible musician.
it’s shameless showing herself off like that at her age sad if that’s the only way to get noticed and get attention
An attractive body and sweet sounds please our cravings. But it is not true love. It has so much selfishness in it, and it never fully satisfies. Seek the True God of Boundless love 💖💖💖 Stay away from the false Gods, please, have mercy on yourself and escape the realm of abuse and deceit. I am sorry for Jaden Smith, who was forced into very wrong deeds  😥💖💖💖
Not so  bad.  I was expecting something boring.  Refreshing.
I like this song, I don’t like the side boob or hoe outfit. All that fame, money and motherhood.. still choosing to dress like this.
i find country awfull, i don't like this shit
Das ist weder Beyonce noch ist es ihre Stimme? Was zur H... ist da los?
Cool👍🏻 😊beautyful song ❤
Well she did sell her soul to the devil and is apart of the illuminati
Que porquería de video la canción fantástica pero el video feísimo
Home grown classic country, I had no idea. I would buy a Beyoncé country album.
Beyonce has such a machine behind her they've convinced people this is actually a good song.
I just don't see why any group of people in America would be against any artists doing a different type of music. That's what music is. If a rock artist suddenly get the feeling and wants to make soul music that should be okay and if Beyonce wants to record a country album and you don't like it then don't listen to it!
Shitty song
This isn't Country ,Turn to George Strait or Alan Jackson for Real Country Music.
She sucks as a country singers she needs to just hang it up and stop singing
Respect..wonderfull song and woman...Greetings from Austria
This is silly.
Beyonce could shit on the floor and his fans would still say is a masterpiece
One of the worst songs produced in the last 5 years, congrats
This is ain't country
With all due respect I know you worth a net worth of $800 million but rather stick to your own genre.
Very good Song...very Bad video
Z
Why, as they get older, do they have to go Full SLAPPER in the videos?
İconic bir beyoce parçası bu kadın bir zamansız klasik eskidikçe güzelleşiyor...
Cheap vidieo song sucks
The most powerful woman 🥰 she’s my number one 🥰 I love you my queen 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why bother to come out with your napkins!  No surprise to your game you always show everything the good Lord gave you
I have been learning for weeks and I have got why do the say a seere
Soft porn, too bad they all pledge allegiance to the devil 😈
She killed this clip
Dress code
cultural appropriation
Low budget video👎🏽
Surekli ayni hareket ve orasi hep göz önünde
This is not a real country song and if you dont like this comment deal with it
Please check the song by Casting Crowns Song NO BODY. here on Youtube  listen  to @ the 2 min 12 sec and see her sampling Casting Crows song wooow
I wonder how the disliked this video is?
The worst video ever - yuck
My God what a horrendous confusing song that sounds absolutely nothing like country music. No wonder no Country station will play it.
Sorry… dislike 👎
Worst video ever! I was kind of getting behind the song with my children, but dang! This is awful!
this song has nothing do to do with texas
by far the worst song and the best music video ever
Kanye West will be fizzing at the bumhole over this video. I can just see him interrupting TS again at the VMAs
Wow  Straight trash  She swears now and uses the Franklin the Turtle theme as the sample and mix ...
This is one dumb song
How is this country it's more hip hop and country 👎🏻
Trash. Sounds boring, and sounds  like she  strained  her voice.
No thanks!
This is Pop not country
Of course one eye covered..
Nice visuals, both of them.
She’s a beautiful woman but this outfit looks ridiculous on her. Screams of desperation
😂❤
This is the most boring repetitive video I've ever seen and that ridiculous outfit. She looks like a homeless person 🤢
What garbage lol
What a woman😍
Mi pistolita todavía tiene muchas municiones que descargarte
What the heck is she wearing???
She’s so fuckin fine
She did Michel Jackson whitening hahhaha
🚮❌️❌️❌️
It IS so Bad music
Lame
Blech! 🤢🤢🤢🤮
Right shame on her
This song is trash sorry to say just sounds like every other song. Song is crap👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮😴😴😴😴😪😪😪😪
Lame
My first time hearing this. God damn this song is trash! Sorry, but not her at her best.
why why this is what mk ultra does fro that decision making
So sick  of hearing this everywhere!!!.....Plus your video is disgusting!🤮🤮🤮
l Love Texas Hold.em
stop picking on beyonce its a great song
Songs ass
I love ❤
There’s no way this is a song 😂
meaningless vídeo
if you have no creativity , just put a women showing her breast saying basic things. welcome to the music groupy
This is garbage and a very sad attempt to break into the country scene we have something already  it's called country rap and we ha e a king of it already his name is upchurch
I never considered Beyonce, a country singer, but she did well here. She should run with it.
That's some fine Texas acreage right there.
That’s the worst song ever . That’s not even country wtf is this ?
I love it!
clone
What a STUPID SONG LOL
This song and video sucks.
Venha ao Brasil novamente 🐝👑🇧🇷

le clip le plus éclaté que j'ai vu
This ain’t country
If you like this song you don’t actually care about music

Just l
Say I am your biggest fan love your country song bro I wish you she was in our family bro I love I live in Alabama I am not a country girl but I like Beyonce's country song everybody subscribe to Beyonce❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
The vid is so werd 😳😳
I stand with rebuke in regards to my previous opinion and You releaseing a country album.  Whatever you need mama, thank you for being a strong woman. 🕯️🐾
Dumbest shit I’ve honestly ever heard
7:20
This song sucks not country music
Sorry Beyoncé but you ain’t no Dolly. Stick to songs like Halo.
What’s the point of this ‘visualizer’?
This trash ain’t country
Boring 😢
Pourquoi se mettre presque nue pour un clip. Je comprends pas.
Mort cérébrale en voyant Beyoncé aussi belle et pulpeuse dans ce clip. A part ça......Quel est l'intérêt de ce clip répétitif. La chanson est sympathique mais moyenne par rapport à ce qu'elle a fait avant. Elle a du vendre plus d'album avant que ce même album sorte......Le buzz
Lexus bestaat en is geweldig !!
Hé c'est Franklin Il est là pour jouer avec toi Regarde le grandir Comme toi et moi  Le voici avec ses amis Ils ont des histoires Ils ont tout leur temps Pour toi
Her R & B videos are much better than her country. It seems her country videos lacked. I understand switching genres, however watching Beyoncé doing the same thing over and over or pouring whiskey into a cup an entire song hardly seems creative.
The level of the video is beyond criticism, it's as if she brought a five-year-old boy to make a video clip for her. And really Beyoncé doesn't suit you country style
☺☺☺☺☺☺🐎🐎🐎🐎
I don't now..but this song give me some positive vibes and i like listening in a car special
Lame ...sexualized  ...she is so sexualized and her shit is an embarrassment ...the target audience  ...IS YOU !
Lol, what weed Beyonce smokin? Some weed that converted her from R an B to country artist ?
Miranda has you girl....sorry
Hey it's Lady Gaga😂😅
Listening to this while a
WOW! OMG! YOU COMPLETELY MISSED THE BEAT on reality! No doubt it’s hot but that’s all it is!
This is the absolute reason why people in Texas don’t like beyoce.
Not country and country videos do not have skimpy  cowboy costumes Yikes
This is a Disgrace to Texas and 2 country music. They should take your s*** down we don't care for you 20million lol
oh yesss pop “country” lol
Mid song and it’s annoying
this "visualizer" is wack
The eye 👁 symbol ,illuminati
you made the best song
Because she can she's the  B GIRL LOOK AT HER SHE THE BEST
The video is terrible . So redundant. I think the song isn’t bad at all
I came here to make fun but it’s actually nice.  Good for her.
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 I’m so FED UP WITH YOUR STUPID LITTLE SONG 😤🤯
not country for me
With all her money I'm sure she can afford more clothes.  Clothes on is sexy.
Not criticized with anything but I do miss the r and b  and how beautiful your voice was.There is this just a little bump in the career.And soon will we have you back to the old stuff
Creative like a strip bar. Ugh, so disappointing. Sorry, not country.
This song is dog shit
No!!..she doesn't have a country voice..baby stick with what you used to do..country music is not for you girl!!..sorry but not sorry
This is literally the laziest attempt at a crossover ever. This is the most genetic ass lyrics and phrases. I'm from Tx and we don't talk like this or do any of these things. If country was truly a genre you wanted to explore why not study the music and do a honest attempt at it. This is Beyonce so she will always have fans but this isn't it. Not even close.
🔥🎵🔥🥰😍🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😎
I like Beyonce a lot, but I’m really disappointed that she no longer releases music videos for (her singles at least). It takes away from the experience as a fan. She did the same for renaissance, after teasing her fans with short clips of the visuals and it’s getting old. For an artist that is known for releasing visual albums, it’s kind of odd that she is going against her own standards. Anyways, I wisher her the best of luck
I love this song but why can’t the video be classy? Why resort to that outfit?
song & video = absolute trash
Well, good work everyone, you overplayed this song so much that I came here just to tell you fucking shit I think it is.
This Song Sounds like some SIMPLE SH*T!!, THE ONLY REASON MEN LIKE IT, IS CAUSE SHE IS HALF NAKED
No offence to the girl but this video is so boring id rather watch paint dry
This song is terrible, this video is even worse!  Such a slap in the face to country music!!  This woman can dance. Why wouldn't she do line dancing to this song?  This video is so far from classy and sooooo far from country.
Great voice as always, horrible lyrics.
Sounds stupid  .
Beyoncee is so beautiful
Great i love❤
Is it necessary to show your breasts? What a shame about the song so great.
I’m sorry this is shit
El vídeo más minimalista,simple y aburrido que he visto jamás.  Parece una tomadura de pelo.
What a 💩 video
This song suxxx.. lol.
worst song ever made
The Music Video Falls Short of Themactic If you're gonna go TX I suggest we hit the Wilds and Settler Themactics and Cross on to California by Trail, Dress your best lady and take it from there, Good Work
It's better than the rest of "modern country"
Who got screwed over for her benefit?
This ain't Country. Go peddle it elsewhere. Sorry
TRASH ASS FUVKIN SONG
Explain Ya husband Beyoncé #puffdiddy 😊
Not good
not long until jay z and you fade away
some cost cutting was made during this video 😂
This has got to be about the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard or seen ... I don't think she hit the mark like Cyrus and Nas
Visualizers and lyric videos are basically things they release making a music video.
Hmm Bruno Mars makes music they say he is cultural appropriation. Beyonce makes a country song out ot no where no one says anything.
https://youtu.be/rl0-augsLug?si=5wOgaREX7tBZvc_V
Wtf hate that video, when creativity ends
If she really wants to get into country, I suggest she get into bluegrass or some Southern blues.
I don't think this is the genre for her.
were not talking about that dummy
You are my sunshine
Why does she need to be half naked to present the song? I love the song and Beyoncé‘s boobs on their way out are just disturbing 😂
The  music is more country than Taylor Swift for sure.  I think the video is too much, sexual, for most American country music fans.  bitch is offensive too.  But I overall like the song.  And it was a boring video.
I love this song So much ❤❤❤❤
Looks like Beyoncé just claimed her stake in new country!
why is there so many dislikes what is going on? this song is so good
Taylor swift: I’m going back to my country roots and releasing a new album. Beyoncé: 😮 Kanye: dw2,5-/fa
Great song....the video ehhh but who am I to judge. I will never have her money or talent.
Beyonce have alot of trust in the vest then my life but why does she keep on doing the same thing it's fun in the beginning but once you see it enough it's annoying 💀
Is this really her clip ? I was expecting something more different for this time, something rustic and natural. They really could have make an effort.
Charley Pride was a black country singer, she ain't got it!! 🤷‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Narrow is the road less taken. Not impressed.
Ich liebe dieses Lied...
Beyonce, please stick to Pop/R&B! Your version of country SUCKS as bad as this video🤮
Like the song but not the video
Lmaoo when you can't beat Taylor swift at the Grammys so she has to make country music to get to America
Me encanta esta cancion  Is beautyful❤❤❤
This is terrible
This is terrible
This Beyonce on a country song nit her singing country
this is trash pure and simple
Super❤
Wow, so bad it's not even funny.
This is a man in drag look at it properly
Rubbish song. Probably took 12 producers and songwriters as well.
Inappropriate:yes Appropriate:no💀💀
Why so vulgar
Can't believe they play this crap on British radios...
Sucks.  You’re still not gonna win an award.  Stop chasing waterfalls, stick to the rivers and the lakes you’re used to.
JAY Z AND BEYONCE ARE IN HIDING, CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THEY TOO ARE ARRESTED.
😮 VV.
THE CARTERS ARE IN FREAK OFFS WITH DIDDY, BEYONCE IS A DEVIL.
Why are you people allowing this devil to Infiltrate Country music, she is with Diddy, boycott her music.
This seems like a horrible song, just me?
Franklin the turtle did it first sorry not sorry
how cheap can a billion air make a film clip for?
Butto for  report 👇
This is garbage
Beyonce is dope, wouldn't expect anything less from a Virgo, you rock
🤮🤮
😂
Pure disgusting garbage
Love ❤️ 😍 💖 😂😢😮😅you
I'm sorry, that whole thing, song and that outfit - such an offense to the country music world.
CRAP!!
Uh oh. She will go down in phase 3.  These people are fucked.  The Damm  has broke.
It's been 25 years since she's looked this sexy...AI has come a long way
A for attempt, but definitely not a Shania Twain or a Reba McEntire =\
Awesome.
Beyonce,  Here's what we have to do!   Fire Kane Brown from American music industry immediately, because he can't sing.   He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.  There were many country singers who tried to help him out so that he could stay in country music business, but he failed every time.  He just can't sing and sounds hideous!      Chris Young, Hardy, Blake Shelton, Marshmello, Khalid, H.E.R., John Legend and Lauren Alaina (Not a singer just American Idol contestant loser): almost every country singer tried to work with him, but failed.  No future for that dude.
Illuminati skum
I love this song Beyoncé 👩🏿‍🦱🐎👩🏿‍🦱🐎
I love this song 🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎
I didn’t know Beyoncé was white
one of the DUMBEST VIDEOS ever made.....there are a lot of observations to make on this....doesn't even sound like a country song for one....
Yo me ya mo Beyonce
If you look up cliché this is what the search results is.
She's not even dancing just repeating the same movements over and over again to brain wash you
Love your songs , ask them who I am and who we are , I'm the messiah king tutankhamun Steven Matthew LaMere, I'm son of marry the ankh the symble of reincarnation rebirth the boy king , golden child , my mom Nefertiti my God mom Guadalupe that's white buffalo calf woman, 44 yrs ten months ago they came to great falls Mt airport and leaft ,the morning star star of Bethlehem, it's the star of David death God mom hurts they said me and my son had passed away June 21 2023 house of pieces

Boose Cool Boose
I guess those that say they say this is a video need glasses, this was a disgraceful to ALL women. Show all your breasts except he nipples why cover them. Why do artist ant to dress half naked. It’s all sick anymore
This song made it #1😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkcAH-m9W0
Thank you for your buffalo chicken wings and ofcourse southern fried chicken with bourbon whiskey dancing with Beyonce wow don't take a lot to make me happy I see recognise quality tuck year as Beyonce aww xxx

Mein Lieblings lied ❤❤❤❤
Cultural appropriation if you ask me 😂😂😂
RAPAZ QUE MULHER GRANDIOSA
I appreciate the bits of R&B mixed in especially at the end. It's a smart song.
Hé c'est franklin
“Hey it’s Franklin” Next time you steal a PBS children’s song do a better job of disguising it. Other than that your catalog is pretty interesting.
“Here comes Franklin!!”
Disappointed in this visualizer. It could’ve been a colorful sunset, horses and fields. It just doesn’t go with the vibe and joy of the song.
This song sucks ass
YES
Country music isn't just notes or a certain rhythm, but a whole culture  of decency in clothing, in the themes of the songs, in the dance movements, of story-telling narative lyrics, and so on. No nacked singers, no grinding-bodies dancers, no broken-record-repetitive-and-almost-empty lyrics...
This ain't country !!!
Ok I just lasted under 2 minutes.  So according to Beyonce, you need to be half naked and use profanity. Lady you have NO reason to be in the country music industry. Jesus H Christ!!!!!
Crap
She is almost naked sorry but too much and no class!
what is a visualizer
Song great the video terrible
C'est ça le clip ? Une image en répétition... Autant de musique est sympa autant le clip. Ça  n'a pas dû vous coûter bien cher. Voir une femme à moitié à poil c'est pas vraiment novateur.
Love beyonce but that's an insane amount of cgi and photoshop
Worst waist of a great song and shit video
She should stick with what she knows because this is sad which surprised me because she has a great voice, just not for this kind of music
Monarchslave 😢
Great song!!! 😍
Why such great artists woman Has to look like sexual objects? 😑
Sounds so fucking stupid when is this ok? Wat a joke of an album and the idiots like it??? 😂
Sux badly
At least in country music, you don't have to dress half-naked, and shake your butt all the time.  She's getting too old for that...enjoying the music though.
The Satanism is strong with this one
Mama ain’t a mama here
It's ridiculous that anyone would even call this country. And the clip sucks. Kitschy, not country.
Beyoncé never trusts anyone
I KLICKED ON THE TEXAS TOLD 'EM AND I REGRET ITTT
Garbage in Garbage out.
Her downfall she's using Texas for money 💰
All raight Red women dua, yes. 😊😊😊
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down After midnight, we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout We're gonna stimulate some action We're gonna get some satisfaction We're gonna find out what it is all about After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
Stay in your lane B, this aint for you. Especially when you paid millions to get the radio to play this shiiiiiiiiiiit
Long the song but don't give a rat's behind about Beyonce. Really dumb video and not interesting.
That shit ain't country!!!  Neither is she!!!
Put some clothes on and set an example.  I won't listen or watch again.
Man this is hot hot garbage
because it sells real big. That's the talent
LMAO. This song is garbage and this video is the proof that Beyonce herself agrees. She couldn't be bothered to film anything more than a softcore porn gif for it. I am sure there is someone somewhere requesting this on a country station who is being told to kick rocks as they should but most people know what this is.
Also huskers tails longer 😭
One of my friends just did your dace
If there is one thing Beyoncé  is going to do: it is make a music video in black n white
The pink couple wants the Dimond   Play button pink
Garbage
She could make a polka work or a waltz. She is Beyonce and has the talent and budget.
I wish she wouldn't feel the need to show her body so much, she has a nice voice,  being nearly nude is distracting n disrespectful
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bellissima, e bravissima ❤
Sounds like she has a cold with all those achoos
Kkkkk cabra é fod4;depois problema sou eu mata a beyonce kkkkk 😍❤
JuSt considering grandkids,  I have no problem. with artistic freedom.
Who else came here after listening to "Franklin the turtles" Theme song?
I'm proper obsessed with this song. I listen to it several times a day lol
A great song but the "outfit" doesn't fit, so to say - other than feeding that obsession for sexual stimuli, something Beyonce wouldn't need :( Really, that's how cowboys/girls were/are dressed?!

Lets' give back this rhythms to who really belong! that´s why I liked it! Now I understand!
What a trashy video - our country women have at lest some respect for themselves. So please keep your destructive negativity out of country.
A Ja myślałem że Marylka nagrała coś po angielsku 😂
This is def not country music... but it is a trap off if u get caught up in the country awards and don't give her a award. Cus she will run off and cry the race card. That's what the main purpose was to begin with.
Gross
This makes me wanna go fast right off a fucking cliff.
So hot
Can't she do anything with clothes on
As a Beyoncé hater, this track eats 👂
When wil the actual music video drop????? Isn't she making music videos anymore?
George Strait / Alan Jackson: “There’s been a murder on music row”  #nuffsaid
This is not the official video yall slow for thinking it is 😭💀
In the Name of the Randy, and of the George and of the Kenny Rogers, I say FARRK THIS SCHYTT!
That vest must be taped in all the right places ❤
.... This aint Texas ...... and you aint country ..........   stank - stench - sloppy ......................
Interesting one 👁️ focus on her face lol #conspiracy
I like it for dance music but this video is disgusting! Not watching this crap! Song great but the rest is awe full.  That really wrote this song because I have a feeling it really wasn’t Beyoncé. I think she was the one that recorded it because that is not her style to begin with. Heads off to who did write that song great job!
Qué sentido tiene este video en un bug que se repite y nada más? 🙄🙄🙄🙄
💯 ❤
Wrong song with this interpretation
LOVE the song, but hate the video!
Verdadeiro culto ao Satanás
Geez, have some self-respect. We don't want to see your junk.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼 Prob the most expensive vid of AAAAAAALL times.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

Not even a true country song
She has to come out half naked cause that song sucks
I feel like she degraded country music with this. I’m not a big fan of country music, but what I’ve always appreciated about their music was the lyrics and the storytelling.
boring😒😒😒

Wtf
This isn't a country song. She needs to give it up and stick to her kind of music. Bad video and song. And the way she's dressed wow disgusting
Sounds like country music to me
To jest oryginalnie agrany teledysk😮? Tak to ma wyglądać do tej piosenki?😮😓
Beyoncè: hold on lemme just use the Franklin and friends theme song
Crazy how people are learning what a visualizer is for the first time, cowboy carter is so so educational 🥰
The plot of clip is weak
That sucks .
❤ This is horrible.....no part of this song was enjoyable including the video??? It was a loop of a nearly naked Beyonce❤
It's a very popular song these days.
That's not Country.. but I'm sure some will like it, hard pass for me
Boaring
This is a joke of a song
This video doesn’t need this much nudity
TRASH
Actually really like this. I wouldn't normally listen to Beyoncé, but I really got into this
Me to
texashas been a lie since 2008 when i been there

Quelle horreur ce clip, dommage la chanson est top 😢
Hy
You’re not country   Quit while you’re ahead
Put some clothes on woman
Yawn. Garbage.
Like the song but the video doesn't make any sense. She is better than this. Disappointing

Please Support me sir😢😢

Why is this on here. It's disgusting 😂🎉
I was told about this video and I said no way...................... But I be dang here it is. I have never laugh so hard in my life . Go back to pop or what ever you where singing in. Did she really say that white people was taking over rap so she was taking over country music ?
That is Not Beyoncé ‼️
This is such a fun country song!! I actually had negative feelings about ‘Beyone’ going country, but.. I LOVE THIS SONG!! But..I think the video is not appropriate for this song! The song is fun and energetic, but the video that accompanies it is not with the vibe of the music!
This is eveything but country. Stay in your lane..and. tell your husband to make out with p diddy AGAIN..don't belive me..google it. This lame song been out for almost 3 weeks now..t swift already passed it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8GlUpMHi0I
Absolutely stupid video.
"park your lettuce"?
Not country.
Nők: Fel vagyunk háborodva, hogy szexuális tárgynak tekintenek minket! Beyonce: Fogd meg a söröm...
1:23:32 eeee
Yes Queen B❤️ Love it❤️
Struggling to understand what she was trying to do.
Video un tantino narcisista

Nice song, but I really can't stomach her country impression!!! Give me Lainey Wilson anyday!!!
No no no u not country stop it girl. U acting like mgk now
Cant wait for Act 3❤❤❤
This song dont seems new at all to me, anyway, was really surprise was done by beyoncé, but the the song is good. BUT THE CLIP IS A FUCKING BULLSHIT; Do you have to show your pussy each tile you go out, and moove just as a fucking slut ? I thougth it was a cultural dedicace to People and art of texas. but its just a fucking money affaire. History is rude, future no good.
The album is legendary. ❤❤❤❤
😂
Ew wtf… this is disrespectful to country music. Plus this is just an awful loop of her half naked?!? Do people even get creative anymore?
Pew Pew... Whoo Whoo...  S U C K S
that`s not country music....put some clothes on!!   yucky
Real country singers wouldn't dressed like that. We have kids watching this video

Country song
Most boring video for most awesome intro Texas movie soundtrack 🙄
Stupid vid ! 😂😂
What an awful song !! 😂😂😂
Beyonce, you know Gaga
I would love to name my dog your name Beyoncé ❤😊
This song sucks big time. As gor someone with talent, she didn't apply it.
Бахти тъпата селска песен, честно! Намерих клипа само за да го коментирам.
🗑️🗑️🗑️
theres no need to be that skimpy. good song already

Beyoncé u have no fear 😧 I will not wear that jacket if o was u 😜
canone bellissima video orrendo
trash
"Country folk" don't typically drive Lexuses, otherwise, song is pretty good.
Terminate Kane Brown from American music industry.  He has fully established that he can't make money from singing.  There were many country singers who tried to help him out so that he could stay in country music business, but he failed every time.  He just can't sing and sounds hideous!      Chris Young, Hardy, Blake Shelton, Marshmello, Khalid, H.E.R., John Legend and Lauren Alaina (Not a singer just American Idol contestant loser): almost every country singer tried to work with him, but failed.  No future for that dude.,,,..
The music is awesome, but it needs to put more story videos on there. What's the song about like Texas or not it's not about walking and gun shooting. 🤔
Kanye at the CMA's. ((((((Beyoncé had the best country music video of the year)))))😂
Can someone stop her now please? Please!?
Mo I don't see country music dancing half necked. Don't like snd am black  I am sick of seeing have necked people let's see the children dance. Stick to  the old school. I would not buy it. I was brought up decent. You suck on this one Beyonce
Most pathetic song I ever heard in my life
Va a ser mi bailable 😅
Damn
Came for the bango. The bango is good.
She is nasty not country she is not wearing any clothes
I’ve heard this song way too many times
Great song - bloody boring video, must have been made on a budget of 50 dollars

Wowww everyone was right this has to be the worst song  ever .. she has a wonderful voice and many wonderful songs .. but unfortunately this just isn’t it but when your at her status you can do whatever.. just don’t ever do this again
Beyoncé Knowles-Carter definitely has a way of getting people's attention when it comes to the music industry. 🎶 🎵

tHX BEYONCE , I hope you are not much mad :))
A lot of people thought she was taking  the piss out of the lone star state, she's from Houston, texas😂😂
Put some clothes on...ain't nobody wanting to see that. Plus showing skin doesn't make the song any better.
Worst song I have ever heard.  Stick with whatever it is you do and leave country music to the real singers.
This is the fruit of a Contract signed between the NAACP and the Acadamy of Country Music for DEI. Gives them lower intrest rates.
This is not country
Beyoncé is just 🥵
😂😂😂😂😂 all I see is tits and a fake pew pew. Country music a story set to music.
She is of course super talented and beautiful...but ive always thought she just has the worst fashion sense of any entertainer....including this outfit...they had the chance to put her in daisy dukes and a picnic table cloth design shirt...this is just so blah and cheesy but thats her style.
I just love the cd Cowboy Carter its the first Beyonce cd I bought country music just got a whole lot better
That was Horrible
I mean the same thing over and over and over? It's boring.. Not the song.. the video is
Beyoncé,tu nunca mais vai fazer um videoclipe na vida não mermã?
i hate this song so much. such a downgrade in my opinion.
Is she fat?
0:12
I like it. The song I mean. She's good.
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" remains at #5 for its 10th week on the Billboard Hot 100! "Cowboy Carter" dropped 1 spot to #2 for its 3rd week! keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! 👑🐝🤠
My 18 year old daughter was killed 3 years ago.  I find myself listening to sad songs ALL the time. Sometimes I get tired of the darkness…then I found this song. I just can’t help but smile when I hear it. It’s now my go to, get out of your mood, song.  Thanks, B!
Genius!
I love this song
Great voice and greater soul, able to sing Country so well.
Bouncy should sing a song about her involvement with child trafficking instead of singing silly songs like this.
Not one thing about this, her , or her music is country. Should've kept it in your own genre or did it right and did it justice. What a joke to country music.
Great music, unmatched vocals…. Cover them up, lady! You’re a renounced artist….. leave them outfit to the talentless
If it wasn't because she is almost naked this song would not be as popular. A true female country singer can get a hit song and still be dressed
This Ain't Country and neither is beyonce. This is why I don't listen to the so-called country music stations anymore. A YouTube my country music real country music actual country music
Do you like it. Try it on. The mirror.
Awful song
Pour some liquor or sugar on you? Wait wait, just asking! Either way YES!
CHANGE THE GAME‼️
lmaoooo whoever though it was a good Idea for her to sing Country music should be ......... again this song is so stupid, and her outfit is the same, no 50-year-old should dress like that lol
From flirting w/revolution to Americana. Ok.
There needs to be law against imitation country singers and imitation country songs. Give me Charlie Pride, or Patty Loveless any day.
The best way to listen to this is to turn it up REAL LOUD then push the mute button!!
#Philadelphia
This video is shit anyone do this video
B, just take your career in your own hands and everything will be great again. This is bad, and this is not you
No, she’s not the number one country album. A lot of people hate that Beyoncé country. Nobody liked Beyoncé country because she was never country because she was born in Texas and raised in Texas.
🫶🏽😭
🤣😂 This is a country song??? Good lord I can't even take this woman serious in regard to music let alone country music....This is all about money and controversy, controversy sells. One thing's for certain, she will never get any of my money lol.
Only 485k 👍🏽
babe what is this😭🙏
It's basically her doing the balphomet
That’s not country and that’s a want to be country star dressed in Street Walker close. Disgusting! 🤮
Do people actually listen to this alone in their free time, kinda a scary thought
wtf is this dribble
Daammmm
😂😂😂😂 0/10 for the video
Wtf is this
Cover up for the kids sake 🙄🙄🙄
The only way women can hold audience these days is to be mostly naked. Pathetic.
❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘Y LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY BEAUTIFUL BEYONCE!Y LOVE THIS MUSIC!
Call slu$$y and trash the song.. if you want to be country playing country music you need to dress country not trashy ho&
Yuck 🤮🤮🤮
Inappropriate
My question why does it go all over and over again
33M Listens in just one thread. That is freaking crazy.
cultural appropriation
The truth is is Beyonce is most likely very upset about what female rap and hip hop has turned into!!!!! So somebody told her it's a good idea to try country music but forgot to tell her she shouldn't dress like a s*** when she did it!!!!!!!
gyattttttt
I will never follow this person, just rubbish to make people aware that those of you who are fans are stingy followers of Satan, because God never asks for anything in return.
Mid af
What the heck is this?!! I see the world we live in embodied in this video. Dark, desperate and on a vulgar downward looping spiral. Apparently, her voice isn't enough.
This sucks. So many of us fans were expecting a cool video... and got this... 😢
Congratulations B! This is such deep country music. Prophetic. I love it! Love u.
She can’t sing! 👎🏽
In a desperate attempt to stay relevant. This B—— desecrates that which is “America’s Music.”
#thisainttexas #layyourcardsdown #joemama #chachalina
If you're reading this. Stop listening to Beyonce she is leading you to hell 💯 facts
Stop being a disappointed
She is a good person
It is a good song don't be so rude
I'd rather listen to this then watch the same ish ovvvver n ovvvver ppl on tic tok did it better.
I bet she couldn't name 10 country music albums.. nor could her fans 😊
This is the worst "video" ever, even though it isn't a video. # sick of Beyonce, really.
i hate this song
not country and never will be
Why has she never done country!!!!! She is AMAZING!!! ❤
❤llove is very much more ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ you do it so very true and good to
Why do they have her doin the same thing over and over? Easily answered question, she is a tool and this fuckin song SUCKS!!
I cringe every time this song comes on the radio. Taylor Swift out here setting super trends.
Música chata
and that kids is how beyonce got leaked
Most horrible video of all time.
This is a video Britney would do.
Disgusting Texas disowns you
You can’t even Do Country songs
Lazy
People mad that she makes better country music than 99.99% of country musicians.
How sad, country is not slutty
🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love TEXAS HOLD'EM
Just no bouncy... stay in your lane pls...
Garbage.
trash music.
SERPIENTE EN EL OJO ( PRIMADO NEGATIVO )
Poor role model !  A tarnish to Country Music!!!
AWFUL. JUST AWFUL
Reminds me of Hank Williams.😂😂😂
elle est ma chanteuse préférée
Bro why she doing the same thing
She thinks she is singing country but it is pop and the video has nothing country in it.
My cats could make a better song 🤣   And don't get me started on this visualiser, like how much did they spend on this 💩
This song SLAPS!!! Makes me happy.  Yes, I see the pun that I made. Sorry, NOT sorry😉😉😉
She makes a lazy dumbass horrendous song and cant even make a proper video to go with it  😭🤣
yeah but they like the dance!😅
Sounds horrible no matter how much they try to force me to believe it’s not. Keep your illuminati.
Stop doing country music, its not part of your culture.
B is using country like she used Jay-Z. She divorces Jay-Z/Hip Hop due to pending FBI charges into their 20 yr criminal Enterprise & Murder of Kathy White, J's pregnant girlfriend. 👿
Super toller Song, doch ihre Busen will ich nicht sehen! Das Lied wird dadurch nicht besser, warum muss das sein, versteh es nicht.......
She definitely messes that song up!!! That isn’t a good video. Horrible!!!
Where the horse at lady Where is your guns you need to go back to the other music
Nope i didn't love this song all she is doing is walking and sticking her finger out and shooting so stupid
Imagine never speaking on being from Texas until country is cool 😂😂
Wait! Now I get it  Texas hold ‘em She’s talking about those utters Texas these things are saggin  Nothing can hold em lol😅
Because that’s what one trick ponies do…. The same shit 💩 over and over…lol Poor Jayz
Why is the world like this see the next video she is gonna be naked
never heard a more boring song
Thank GOD this is footage
I'm not even a Beyoncé fan but how come people in this comment section don't know what a visualizer is
This is the way the music industry is going. More sexual and more unholy. Pray for those effected by the darkness in the music industry
You really have to dress like that that its not a beauty song beyonce
Use this as the dislike button
BUY CRYPTO VGX
Beoncye is a queen  to all the  haters  commenting  how  many  number one  singles  you all ever  had  ah  zero  so sit the fk  down and shut  up
That's perfectly shaped silicone.
This isn’t country.  It sux.
I Beauty song ❤
Stupid visualizer..great song
Who tf listens to this crap?
I hhhhhhate this song!!!!!!
This song sucks lmfao stay in your place

Hola Puerto Dico
Se murió La Fundadora?
Hola Adriana: Hola Suiza?
Quien juega en los Yankees?
Donde están los empleados de Chase? La gente Blanca?
La gente habla de todo lo que sucede
I love this song and I’m from Brooklyn New York lol
2024 🎉😂❤
Great video great song!
You are not shy at all
You are so confident
Song is horrible!  Not a role model in that getup!!!
This has an unpleasant tone, have to turn it off when on the radio - has the ability to turn the atmosphere sour.  Probably the only remarkable thing with this song.
Liking the Hosiery ❣️👏❣️ Work ‘em  Girl  😘🤩🌟🤩💫💫🤩
I think this album came out because we are all starting to realize jay z is a murderer and shes been on epstein island and makes trash music in any genre 😂
Gets mad at white people for wearing braids but here she is with dirty blonde weave and we supposed to think shes cute, keep that same energy
💩💩💩💩💩
🇺🇦♥️
This is trash.....
That's not country
Giving Walker Hayes a run for his money....... NOT!
She she gets to culturally appropriate? I see…
Chick filmed a “Country Song”, wasn’t ever OUTSIDE ONCE!!   #STUDIO #CLOWN #CLOWNSHOW Cowboy  🤠 😮😅 🛑🛑🤡🤡🤡
Disgusting
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Such a stupid song
You do not deserve to be singing country music
I'm in a pick up  I'm in the back seat  I'm with my cousin  where is this going
Dumb video for a dumb song
Why does it kind of show her boobs🤮🤮🤮🤮
I am sorry this song is 👎🏼
I’m late to this but what an incredible song.  So beautiful and catchy
She could have more clothes on. Stop hating on her, beautiful voice.
NIGHT NIGHT PARTNER
This song sucks and this ain’t even close to a country music video. Fckn demon
So now its okay for others then black to dress or have their hair so called black?
She forgot some clothes
Beyonce paying tiktok for this every time.i scroll
Disappointed
Some people shouldn’t do country
It sucks not even country
And why do they have to always show cleavage shows young girls it's ok
I never would picture her like this showing almost boobs I picture her in cowboy boots so tacky
This song is gonna drive me jnsane. IT AINT EVEN COUNTRY 😡
Beyonce is an awesome singer, no doubt. But I find it hard to respect her when she always has her boobs hanging out. What do her children think of that?
This sounds to much like shakey Graves to me... and I'm js is way better than this...
I wonder if Diddy helped out?  According to word in the streets, He "helped" her allot.  Always had her "back" too.
Ew
I love the boobs part
Im amazed, the music video is just as annoying as the song😂😂
What does being half nekkked have to do with country?
Shouldn't have to dress like that, to play decent music.  Just saying.
She dies that over and over again and I’m now realizing that when it’s over 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
A half-undressed fat black woman is really not the visual we need; and again, I have no idea what the lyrics are about.  Country music lyrics don't usually call women 'bitches.'  It has elements of Country music (again with the vibrato), but without a true Country experience, this is meaningless.  And a complete example of cultural appropriatism.
What kind of husband let his "wife "go to the street no wearing clothes?? Money Makes peolpe EVIL.
Legendary iconic platinum voice always current!!!!
Franklin the turtle is that you?
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over ?
I hate this song. I disliked this video.
Aren't u singing pop music because I don't really like country music
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssss
Good dance song! Better if she had country Western style clothing on instead of...................! Do not want to describe the look or lack of clothing!
that s no country music
There's some things in life that we should not do and this is one of them
😂 she needs to stick with her type of music cause country music is not for her😅😅😅
Scheiß lied👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎👎👎👎
this is Grammy!
Stick to what you know.  We know country and this ain't it y'all 🙏 ❤️ 🇺🇸
Trump 2024
This fucking sucks
A myślalam ,że będzie tutaj zajebisty teledysk. 😮😮
Cool 👍
Hilarious she's tryna do country but she's pure city raised lol your just embarrassing yourself
Äöh
Good song but I can’t get past she doesn’t sound country.
My new CPR Anthem
help the kid that is known for being a n@zi at my school literally covered his ears when this song started playing at the school dance😭
Top class queen B ❤ your music
Beyoncé is the best
❤❤❤❤
Anyone notice the slight glitching on her chest? Maybe video is heavily edited
Worst song ever
Total trash!!!!
Beyoncé is in her Country era She even changed the lyrics for another song
Love the country sound. One of her best songs.
❤❤
beyoncé ily, but you are wrong for this 😔
I am totally gay
Let’s get this straight I’m not one of those yeehaw all the way cowboy and I’m not all hood either I like most music but beyonce you ain’t country girl stick to R&B this song reminded of on my way from Matilda 😂 and it’s like saying that’s country
Any Taylor Swift country music inspiration ?
🤮🤮🤮
J'aime bien le rythme de la musique mais le clip et stupide. Dommage.
Did you know Taylor was in Hannah Montana
この短いショートムービーで不満が出るのはきっと試された結果よ❤📹私は大満足🎶👏
Tommy did it better https://youtu.be/zeJOS6trEfI?si=e-mUqjh-OAyrC9Gb
Who heard Beyonce on the  radio
The video is weak but the song is phenomenal. She is a musical artist, so she can be forgiven for having a pathetic video when the song is so good. (This reminds me of the SNL skit: Papyrus, when something good gets paired with something crap)
When your music has gone to complete shit and ur no longer prominent….  “I’ll just make a country bumpkin sounding track and have my tits out, that should get me views” lol
Ladies and gentleman please stand for the middle age white woman national anthem.
Absolutely the worst song I have ever heard.
Disgusting
annoying fq song !!!!
Piosenka super ale teledysk żenada
Not much creative imagination here.   If it wasn't for catching attention with the partial nudity (yet again) instead of real artistic talent,  it would be considered a mere jingle.  And that is what it sounds and looks like;   a gangster jingle trying to be county - good Lord have mercy.
Why is she naked for a country song tho
New 007 opener?
Its a horrible song. Fucking bad
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY
Fell off.
zero trust in that jacket... there's so much tape holding it together, I could repair that collapsed bridge.
This was the stupidest music video I’ve ever seen. I’m so tired of Black people holding themselves out for the  entertainment industry.
She is vulger
This song is straight garbage lmao💀
boobs
I'm blind and even I can see this is crap and I'm a country singer she needs to stay away from country big time
Why is it needed to be dressed like that? Sooo low so awful?
A comtake it to the city...
Awh nawh 😮 cute fun song the video is disappointing. I was expecting a family friendly visual 😕
What a disgrace to actual country music!!
I am here out of curiousity. I have no desire to ever watch or listen to it again...
WEAR SOME CLOTHES!!!!!!!! 💀😡🤬🫣😣🤯😫😳
They mad because bey when out genres and made this
An uninteresting "visualizer."
Beyoncé is not country.
Why so many people hate this? I'm not American I don't know what country is
Good grief this is bad!
I no
This visualizer sucks. Is this AI?
Question where you all think country music come from and who made country music first ok I’m waiting
Que aprendan muchos  con letras obscenas ,se puede hacer  buena música  sin tanto dame gasolina .....
With all the money she has and can't afford to buy a bra and pants 🙈😂
I tought  it would be  More Performance😳
I hate how ppl think they’re really country because of her.
Like why do they have her doing that over and over again
cool
She is showing her bobas
Geez what a crap video...... its like she had two minutes to do it or something ....also country ? Nope not for Beyonce
It’s cool if she sings country music. But let’s hope and prey that she don’t corrupt it.   Like this music video.  The music ain’t bad but the video is terrible. I mean she’s almost nude for crying out loud.     That’s so not country.
This is ass and an ass music video
Who was the idiot who composed the lyrics and music for this song? This isn't country music, it's bullshit.
Wow, such talent 🙄
I'm not really sorry to say this, but this album was NOT it. Beyonce definitely CANNOT do country lmao, this shit feels so forced and gimmicky. it's a no from me boss.
What a stupid ass outfits with a stupid song.  That is not country at all girlfriend!!
No matter is she black or white, song is good, bat video isn't specjal rader boring and for me '' doesn't taste ". She is realy preety women but in this clothes she don't look good, don't look sexy...
❤ALiCíA❤❤❤❤🎉😍
What a devil Bad Video for such a cool song
Who would you vote for, as next President to the US, Beyoncé or Taylor? Considering the competion.
Tommy Johannson`s cover of this is so much better
👇 More cloth
❤️❤️
🍑
In my opinion the great thing about country music is that most of the songs tell powerful stories. This album misses the mark. I find it bizarre and forgettable.
So stupid video 🙄
All she's trying to do is sexualize country music...she needs to stay with her own music!🤬
She is making this song in a way of vindication because Beyoncé knows that country music is black... and what the whites have done is steal it completely... in the South of the United States there were also enslaved people, the blacks had brought from when They were taken from Africa as slaves to the United States, they had taken their instruments with them, so they had taken the Banjo 🪕 which is a 100% African instrument... at that time of 1820-1840 the banjo 🪕 was 100% an instrument for blacks , at no time would any white man have said I'M GOING TO PLAY THE BANJO! 🪕 ... in 1850 a show known as MINSTREL became very fashionable (white people who did was paint their faces with shoe polish in a very ridiculous way) and for an hour they laughed at racialized people ... making reference to the fact that People are stupid, they are lazy, they don't work and apart from that they took their instruments and made songs about what they were about the lazy people they were... how they were using the Banjo as early as 1850 with these shows and they incorporated the Banjo... until then White and black people had released albums and their own songs... after the Second World War they decided that this music has to reach the entire United States so that everyone knows country music (that's where they play Country music) what they did It was... take their vinyl records, they took the same songs, they stole them and they put a white singer on them... and that's how they made Country music only White, they stole their own genre... suddenly Beyoncé makes a country song... 1) because he knows about all this... 2) because in 2016 he was invited to sing a song at the Country Music Awards where the type of people who go to see them are people from the South of the United States, who are super racists all over the world. in the public with long faces, it came to the criticism so much that they deleted the video from YouTube...: that's why this year Beyoncé released a Country song saying no no no don't forgive Country music it comes from black people I have all the right in the world and you're not going to steal it from me... and do you know what happened? It has been the most famous country music release in recent years.
Trash 🗑 🚮
The lowest budget music video ever made in all of human history 😂😂😂
Wow. I'm so jealous of the deaf right now. They have no idea how easy they got it.
Worst video ever!
Damn these are some of the worst lyrics of all time.
Nueva entrada en mi playlist #LOS40 España 2024
why does the video have to be so raw.  Kids like the song and I wouldn't want them to see this.  If you want to be country keep it clean.  You have the talent
Came for the sex appeal could careless about the mf being on repeat as long as my eyes are on bee 🐝 😉😏
there is a vedio 4 this song😂
Pathetic
Trash . Appropriating what now ?! Pure Aids
She gone viril like wild fire! 😎❤️
This song doesn't say anything worthwhile listening to. And this sure isn't a music video. The lyrics are pretty much like her other songs; pointless!
❤❤❤😂❤❤😂😂🎉🎉😢😢😮😮😅😅😅😊
Love country, love pop, but this is horrible
Anyone that actually thinks this is country music is sad
Real Country Music doesn't have all of this cursing in it.
i’m sorry but this is sort of bad.
this much money,still looping the video,VFX when?
Do not be hating on this u going to make cry if u hate this so watch something else not this video
Another one in the illuminati cult
No shirt needed
Beyoncé there's people copying copper your song but I really like your song though just❤❤❤
Beyoncé wants to be white so bad
Wtaf this is shit
Well this is shit
White ppl are crying 😂😂😂😂 this is our music created and sponsored by us black ppl get mad as you want.😂
IN LOVE❤❤❤❤
Boooobs😮
this sucks ass
Sory beyonce, thus is easily your worst work ever and will always be.
Great song, bad video, poor Beyonce sad
Come on she could have at least HIRED a Lexus for the visuals 😂
What is up with her wearing a satanic eye gear,this is horrid. Your 50 with kids dress like it. No hat,no cowboy hat, no dancing and the beat is off with her voice.  The song makes no since and the robot satan eye is even worse. She needs a stress counselor maybe.  I usually like some of her music. Her and Taylor swifts new song is also wacked,weird and satan ,evil looking
Weird,ugle,worst performance ive ever seen her do
She couldn’t be bothered to do a video!
I don't think people understand what a visualizer is
Is this all she can do is walk in frame, and run her fingers up her body, half naked, and point her finger like shs shooting a gun? 🤣  This is a damn shame! I'm black and she's not country! 🤣😆 Get the Blank outta here with this ! Half naked, what's she trying to sell? I don't like her song. It don't sound country, sounds like she's singing about fancy cars, shooting, like words gangster rappers would use, slowed down with a so-called country sound. 😆 Girl stick to what you know. Because it's not country!!

Texans must be pissed? Maybe enough to get Trump elected again 😂
비욘세 아름답네요 - 역시 미국  🇺🇸
I don't know... I guess she has studied how sex sells... makes more money. I really wish celebrities would think how this stuff effects the young ones and their own outlook. Good Luck to her and her family.
I really don't get the get-up she's wearing, that stripper look??? A country stripper song??? Not really T & A, just T & T.
She uses her body for attention.  What a shame!   looks trashy.
I guess we’ve come to this. Anyone can show skin. No grit in this girl
Beyonce what is this😭
ILLUMINATI / SATANIC SYMBOLISM: Illuminated SNAKE covering LEFT EYE (0:04) BAPHOMET: BARE BREASTS and LEFT HAND SYMBOL (0:08)
Please  put this song and Beyonce  in the trash her old ass needs to retire  she hasn't  made a decent  song since halo
Nope..nope nope...24 seconds in...24 seconds out.
Delete this video  and song cover from existence  please
Joke
Trash!!!!!
Sorry, country isn't your thing though.
Wow the outfit abit over the top
She ever heard of tin horn?
Fake country
Okay anyone that thinks that Beyonce and country music go together are the same idiots that think they can mix oil with water
Why the fuck did she get hit off of this fucktard song? Texas is pretty pissed off right now  Stick to your R&B and country to the country singers
😂😂😂😂😂 gawd damn
What is ths sht?
Wtf did I just watch???😂
Those are some big boobs
killer carters
RIP AALIYAH
Ava🐤🐦🐧3
This song is awful.
🤢
This is one of the worst videos I’ve ever seen. It’s as if they just ran out of videotape or film to record her and just went home.  Wow!😢
It’s like watching TI do standup comedy.
Some of her new music videos from Cowboy Carter are out now
Well I don’t ever listen to Beyoncé and after hearing this.. I don’t ever plan on listening to her…and it’s a sad day in country music 😢
Not country, we had a meeting and just no. Go back to pop cause county says nope.
Lame ass video with her fake  AI avatar body.  If you are going to do country, then actually do country.  This is embarrassing.
Lilith your time has come

ᴛʜɪs ᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴇxɪs
Dumbest most boring video ever!
I love this song 😊😊😊.  Get some close on😅😅😅
Not country so don't try
Yeah...no
Beyoncé:ummmm I kinda forgot half my clothes Producer:doesn't matter lots of people will want to look at it then 🫣
Man, I really enjoy this song and was hoping for a fun country ish dance happy smiling video. And I get this shit. Puts a spin on the song and gives my mouth a bad taste.
Who else is here from the Tommy J video?
It has a some of Adele's send my love vibe rhythm tbh! 😍😅
WHITIES MAD SHE DID IT BETTER THAN THEM
Beyonce needed some views 😂
I don’t know why she didn’t come out butt neck at least it would’ve been entertaining
She must win the album of the year award for this, she deserves it, we must help her. Let's popularize BEYONCE more than the overrated lady who has literally been stealing all her awards for a years with her anti-talent. We can do it, let’s go! 💪🏽🙏🏽🫶🏽❤️‍🔥🤠
Smh...pitiful.  😖😖😖
she is a talented musician, dose she really needs to  dress like this to sell the album ????
This video has a lot of crotch...

Boring video clip, great song!
Definitely a hoe down from ports are us yryn to be something she will never be. Bad idea
Put on clothes..!!😅
https://youtu.be/zeJOS6trEfI?si=S48h1zGLLvjpVno4
NOT IMPRESSED. 1st - what cowgirl dresses like that NONE! 2nd - the video is over and over and what a waste - not for me. No wonder I never listen to her.
I say, feed it to the chickens!...that's all it's worth!...
Why is she half naked???
Tommy Johansson did better video for cover of this song!😂
Idk
Corny ass song
I guess im a prude. I see this and think is this necessary?
Good music buena música pero le falto coreografía  salud bella mujer
WTF🤦🤦
optisch ist sie doch sehr oppulent
❤😂❤❤😅
Lame Lame Lame
Got milk?
yeah.... trash
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been streamed over 300 million times on Spotify! Keep streaming! 👑🐝🤠
Song is brilliant video the shitiest  garbage I ever seen.
When did Beyoncé become so vulgar and terrible…..😔
It's disrespectful to country music 😢
All the blatantly demonic imagery 😂 Snake over one eye, as above so below hand gestures...
🤮🤮🤮🤮
This is a stupid loop video. Can't a billionaire afford better than this ?
Ew
this is so bad
So this is what she came up with when writing this song is to keep doing the same thing over and over again smh 🙄 I didn't expect this b.s. from Beyonce
Cowboy Carter
Fucking gay!!! I’m late to the party, but was listening to country radio station this morning working in my office, which is rare for me and this song came on and after being annoyed for the first 30 seconds I realized it had to be the new Beyoncé song because I recognized her voice. Gross!! Needless to say I quickly jumped up and changed it before I puked, or let my ears bleed.
PERFECTION? If you want the closest video to whatever you like to family friendly to sexy then try the song Que Bello ft. Kika Edgar. Kika's video will make this Beyonce's video look like used toilet tissue.
If this song doesn't make you want to jump up and dance and put you in a good mood!!!!   Great song!!!!!
Country is country ... Pop is NOT country... This is hot garbage . Anyone who disagrees can meet me out back. We'll  have a meaningful  discussion 💥💥🤜💥💥💫🤛👊  This is a crime against  music.  Stay in your lane ... LA record producers..SHAME ON YOU for encouraging  this .    I DID have respect for Beyonce . As a DJ, I will never spin this and now Beyonce is banned from my  playlists. NOT SORRY !!
Una lástima, un video desperdiciado  pensaba cuándo empieza el baile, acción... Y nada 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
dober komad in zanič video
Time is running out beyonce enjoy the wicked life while you can, cause God ain't having it LMAOOOO
Heard the talk about this song.  first time earing it. Trashy outfit, stupid song. It is what it is.
Half naked wearing a snake on her eye and running the same clip over and over doesn't make a music video. Beyonce is phoning it in on this one because she thinks her fans are stupid and won't mind that she's not even trying.   And yall know she had a team write the song for her.
nice one Girl .
Ugliest song she ever made 🤦‍♀️
50% Nudity 50% Country Music
🔥🔥🔥
I hate the video but love thensong. I wish she did a more family freidnly video for this song, its a family song!
Terrible song.  This is 3 mins of my life I’m never going to get back.  And the worst low budget video ever.  I guess hitting the repeat button is art nowadays.
What's up with the music video?  Looks bad.
Adoro Beyonce. MA la versione country....no. Neanche questo look. Sorry
So shitty lmao
Idk abt yall, but no bullet proof vest = instant death in a texas bar fight
I hate this stupid song
I'm not a fan of what you do, but you suck in this production. Discuss other topics in songs than sex.
Thats its?😢😢😢
wow...don't know much about Beyonce..is that her in the video or a body double !!!
Trump 2024
Beautiful woman, great voice. Is it really necessary to be almost naked? I don't get it.
What it cost to make this video? $500? Lol
Yikes
Beyoncé är verkligen i 40 års krisen då hon klär sig så, för klädseln och låter passar inte ihop. Sedan är Tommy Johanssons version mycket bättre. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJOS6trEfI
People are wondering why they repeat this clip     It's so that Jay Z can finally stop having to rely on viagra     Hopefully
Beyonce fans will probably nail me to the wall, but I think this version is much better and funnier. Maybe even country fans will like it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJOS6trEfI
Lone star
This is Texas mofo !!!there is always Texas!!!!!!!
Been an absolutely terrible song.. She is not country. She has nothing to do with country. The only thing country about her is that she is a. Kunt tree
Boring song, boring video
Get it beyonce
Just an honest opinion. Beyoncé is still on top for me.   She had released several critically acclaimed albums throughout her career, where each album showcased her immense talent and versatility as an artist.   Each of those albums represents a different phase in Beyoncé's artistic evolution and has left a significant impact on popular music. Beyoncé's ability to reinvent herself with each release while maintaining her signature style and authenticity is what makes her one of the most influential artists of her generation. Truly an artist to other artists!  💘😍✨👑
Trash
It's kinda disrespectful...   she should stay in her lane
Who is here after taylor released new album?🎉
Beautiful song with the worst music video ever
Everyone is freaking out like daddy lessons which has an honest to god yehaw in it didn’t happen
So not country.
Good time catchy but ur video of you so disappointing bey! Same routine it makes my toes curl! Awful hon, wtf!👎😏
So dissatisfied 👎ffs, u bogged ur album up! This video 👎ur iTunes dudes👊👍awesome maybe u should have left them to ur tune! Do disappointed! Wtf! Ur worst video yet! It’s like you honest! What a shambles! Cringe🤔😫not great video like I said leave it to utubers, car crash!ur worst yet! Can u ding, dance live to Texas hold them!? Maybe ur out of ur comfort ZONE honey😏
Sounds like shit
WTF! Come on be! Dhite vid! Infuriating dancers on iTunes the best! Do sorry omg😒👎
Jesus Loves you all, He is the answer and the truth , God Forgives all sins , pray and have Faith. Jesus Christ is coming soon
The music: you are my sunshine👹👹👹👹 The sound:OMG TEXAS HOLD EM
Crap video!
If taylor swifts rap was this bad yall would be draagging her...just sayin 😂
I am not a country music guy but this has got to be worse than chanelle from ridiculousness rapping 😂
😮😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
This ain't country, but trying hard to be one like Old Town Road. This song is full of stereotypes of country music, like that common guitar and boot tap melody and Texas. Pop industry making every genre from charming to bull.
They should ban this video from CMT  she's showing half her breasts. But they can try this in a small town by Jason aldean that tells the truth
Your Outfit is horrible!!! What are You teaching your Aweful... Your kids saddens me !!! Jay approves of you sharing your Aweful what parents and teachers
THIS AINT TEXAS WOOOOOO
난 이 노래가 싫어
Texas hold em sucks!!!!🤮👎👎👎👎👎👎
What a terrible song
Boring.
No place in country music. She needs to stop
She aint from texas she originally from New Orleans Louisiana. And her wanna be song texas holdem and no fucking country song!! Take her ass out of Country music Now no one wants that around!!
Did she have to copy the Franklin the Turtle theme song?
The people at the concert: 👀 keep that open      Nah I went to sus I’m gettin striked 💀
This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. Can youtube  bring back the dislike button so I can see how many other people think this is complete trash?
Has beyonce become so desperate to sell songs that she must appear almost naked 🤔😏😅😅
Omg 😅 hideous
I LOVE this SONG 👏👏👏👏👏💋💋💋💋💋🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
This is what city people think country is
Somewhat SURPRISED...😮...The talent she has in her...&...This is the Video that EVERYONE decided on...There has got to be an Inside Joke ..Proving Lady B can do Country (#CMA AWARDS ..Reviews weren't the nicest)..She could have gave them All Class & No Ass..😮..what does being living in Groundhog Day...&...Being half naked Have to do with COUNTRY
She's a great stripper, she should be famous.
Sorry but this ain't country music
Im just here to say this song sucks.
trash 100%
Listening to this while a tornado is going on
🤢🤮
Most boring music video ever. I want my 3 minutes back.
Sh.t sucks
Loved it
rubbish
This song is ass
Gostei da música, mas esse clip é repetitivo. Não entendi,
Deja vu 👇
What a shit video lol
Stay the hell away from country music
Why is she naked
Sorry, I have trouble with the outfit.  Looks slutty.
she absolutely butchered this song. she worships satan
Das Lied gefällt mir aber das Video ist grausam halb Nackt und langweilig schlimmer geht es nicht.
ghetto
Jesus!
Sou mega fã da Beyoncé mas esse vídeo me decepcionou… não deixarei de ser fã, mas esperava mais do q essa coisa repetitiva 🤨😒
A música é muito boa, arranjo e melodias incríveis, mas o clipe....
the video sucks and is stupid
Saving in budget for the dyddis shit lawyers😂
This is really bad
Nice tune, shame about the slutty video.
WE GOING TO TEXAS WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Very nice
I have only heard parts of this song due to tiktok, I came because I head a lot of people throwing a fit over this song... have never seen a beyonve song with over 100k dislikes. fans need to chill out. its a single song
Hhhhu
@ love it thanks ❤❤❤
so a hip hop girl trying to sing a country song telling us how to country lol better drive around texas
Le clip bien pourri, une prise de vue de 3 secondes passée en boucle, nue sous sa veste, les paroles de la chanson j'en parle même pas,et ça y est dans la boîte, elle va représenter l'Ukraine au j.o. celle là aussi 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn! The amount of hate and bitterness people carry in their heart for someone that doesn’t know you exist is crazy.
People need to leave her alone there are country singers that are black white and ect stop judging her and assuming y'all are doing they are idiots and what's wrong with this world disrespect the truth im saying proves my point leave her alone
Saying bitch to a nigga is kind of disrespectful
This song is directions to a line dance, it should be about texas, thats where they get down, the lyrics really make no sense
This ain’t a country song nor a country artist post Malone has a better chance of doing country than she does cause he actually makes songs not stupid stuff that just explains the Texas basics🤦🏽‍♂️
Song awesome Clip ... I'm disappointed. She can dance and instead of texas we see only walking human with erotic pose and ,,shot" from fingers ... wow  And we are amused later why little kids behave like stars ...
Wanna do country and make a video dresses like a ho 👌
Kids watch this stuff too.Maybe you should put some clothes on
What's up with her face lol
She sees country blowing up an she thinks she can do it for the money 😂😂😂😂
This is fucking awful
This is annoying
Back to those Fields.
It’s a visual that I wish I’d never seen.  This is not country music.  She’s from Htown you’d think her country game would be on point.
Country music was the one thing left in America that is still wholesome... until this music video. I love that she's making country, that she's black and breaking barriers, but not that she's  half naked in the video. Come on y'all.
Beyonce is killing it! The most popular DANCE SONG EVER RIGHT NOW! KEEP OUR COUNTRY DANCING!
my dad says she should make up her mind. wear a shirt or dont wear a shirt.
wow what a waste of time this is, I'm sure it will win a award which is a testament to the music industry. here is time I will never get back in my life.
❤️
Country singers do not dress showing so much flesh.  Not appropriate for kids to watch.
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊
❤
Absolutely love it❤🔥😊
Nice country Beyonce ♥
Best song
I made it 47 seconds, cringed, wondered why they in that 47 seconds replayed the same scene 4 times, then wondered how this is considered “country” and assumed it’s cause of the banjo and they repeated things in the song like Dora the Explorer…
She needs clothes on... She sounds great in this song
No thanks!
She's got a wonderful body
I actually like some country music but this is wack af.. and not country...
Why is she doing country?
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
15 sec for dis video, she moves only 4 times.
Why shw dressed like Kanye's wife lol
How can anyone like this music video it's disturbing and she's very disturbed. And she wonders why she never wins album of the year...?? 😂
What a boring, terrible video for a good song. And that "outfit" is ridiculous.
This song is straight trash 😂
Boring
No, no, Beyonce, this song no !  .... sorry ....
Muy bueno
Goes hard on mute 🔥🔥
Whats up with the serpent over her left eye?  good song tho
OMG-LOVE THE SONG BUT VIDEO HUGE HUGE LET DOWN. !
Shania Twain could have sing this better. It doesn’t fit Beyoncé lol
I don't know why people say it's a music video while its a music visualizer
How to trigger a boomer
Une étoile comme on n'en fait plus. 🤲🏻🫀
Cant believe she's doing same thing over and over. It's doing my head in 😂but like the song🎉
Beyoncé completely shows that she's proud to come from Texas with this entire album.
Ehhhh.  Hype.
Dam alive! Now that's a great country all by itself.
Not country.
Country??...mmn no..   Do we have to show our chest in everything?🙄
👌
So close, but we all know she has never been to a dive bar or had any strives we all have
Now go check out tanner adell
Charlie Pride just turned over in his grave....
The only part country in this song is a ho down
If Whitney Houston did a country song I would by her album. This sucks.
This song is honestly horrible
I thought the youtube video was broken, then I realised, she put as much effort in making the video as she did the song.
Why doesn't she do the dance ? Because she can't
I just wish she hadn’t dressed like a hooker.  Detracts from the singing.
God this sounds like dog shit
I think nudity has been overplayed to mean that is sexiness. She is very talented she does not need all this pizzazz and nudity. Her talent speaks for itself.
Great song and video.
Disgusting
This video is annoying af...
stop mocking peoples  deaf
Like the song. Stupid video. Country is not about showing flesh
My science teacher is singing this when I was on my computer cause we’re playing Kahoot
Top record label artist
This could have been a really fun video. It’s a little bit of a bummer.
This is worse than her husband's shitty rap albums. I didn't think that was possible.
For   Real
This is not country, the only reason your doing this is because Taylor swift getting more popular, I'd rather listen to shaboozy's a bar song over and over, than this non country bs
So boring. She's nothing but a musical parasite.
What the hell is the terminator eye about 🤷‍♀️
This song will remind me of a place rn
❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Beyonce died a long time ago; thats just the white rich woman whose inhabiting her body after paying a large large large sum of money
Do y'all not know what a visualizer is?
How is this a country song? All she does is mention things that are country - Texas, cards, tornado. All she is doing is showing off her body. Her song has no theme. Waste to even call this a country song. I smell manipulation from her husband
That sucked! Insult to the wholesomeness of Country Music. Go back to your Genre' of Sex, Cursing, Drugs & Killing people. and.....what the heck kind of "video" was that?
This is such an insult to country music
When teenage girl role model billionaire musicians become porn stars…
Whose backup singer? not Destiny's Child 😅  that ain't  contry, they'll tweak to it 😅😅😅😅
It’s the same video like 30 times
🖤🫶🔝
I don't care for the music, but gyaat dayumn girl <3
Not for children 😮
I appreciate the attempt. But that’s it.
She only did this because Tracy Chapman became the first black women to have a no. 1 country song, but she didn't sing it. So they made a black women sing a country song that would make it to no. 1
James Otto does it better. He has more country soul
Congrats on making the worst non “country song” ever made
i fuckin hate this song
Beautiful voice but get tired of same over and over👉👉👉👉👉👉👉
This thing sucks
🤔
Your son is good
Stupid
Stupid
7 of 9?
🗑🗑🗑🗑
Same reason she sings the 5 same words during the stupid song... horrible song not country music.. turn the channel on anything it's played on.. only looked this up to say the song is horrible, because I'm tired of it popping up on my feed..
Can't believe I justw watched this.
Beyonce is making the real queen Bessie Smith proud yall better google
This some porn....I'm hott
❤
Shes holding em hold em 😂
How to look like a whore example is the entire video. Also country music is not your thing.
This is not country music 🤣 wtf
לייק
סליחה לא נעים לרואת את ה.... זה אבל השיר יפה😊 וגם את מאממת
Que video tan aburrido!
To think this is country music is sad
change the feed :) robl
Im devoloping PTSD with this Song
What the f***What the f***What the f*** is doing her?E, what the f*** fuck f***What the f*** she's doing?What the f*** fuck?What the f*** s***What the f*** s***What the fuck
What the f*** is that Robert shut up?What the f*** fuck f*** fuck and over?Fuck fuck fuck fucks fucks fucks
What the heck?How did they make that over and over
this song sucks!
Thank God, there is the music of guitar n we listen a little bit country ... her voice isn't for country music ...
I don’t see anything wrong with her country music. What’s the problem?
Who came here Bcs of the unis cover
Cheap, no soul, fake music 😂 weak even for Beyoncé.
She is hideous!
These folks( Sean and Beyonce heard Dolph say he was going to do a country album, now this flea bag has a country album...LLKOM 🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
When did beyonce get breast implants They must have gone  sour  after kids and why she mostly naked Was expecting to see some country stuff.Boy was I wrong
I think her song is cute. I use to go to a Country club to meet white Men so her song really makes me Laugh with the words. She can come to a Country club but might not dance much so the words to the song is funny.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Disgrace to the genre....stick to your lane.
I was very confused when I heard this, looked over, and saw it was Beyonce??
ça fait pute de luxe là Beyoncé je suis dégoutée
Oh my god HELP HELP GOD HELP US ALL
❤
How is this not country someone please explain it to me from a musical perspective and do not comment if you don't play any instrument/listen to bluegrass thanks
Nope… stick to whatever you sing/rap!
The toothless must freak out when they find out who does this song!
The song is very good, but in the video I expected much more.
How do people have clothing on like this, and not have a nip slip? Miley Cyrus was doing crazy wild dancing in the "Flowers" music video, with no nip slip
Maybe if she was actually country shed know how to dress, dance and fo a video for country ...im mad that i even stopped to watch the video ..this was my first time and i friggen hate this damn song
Meh.  I prefer songs that paint some sort of picture or tell a story.  "Beaches of Cheyenne", "John Deere Green", "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.  Those are great.  This is a club song.
Blah
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Je l écoute en boucle❤❤❤
J adore❤❤❤❤
this song is garbağe
Beyonce as usual is 💯.  I found the video a disappointment. Now Mrs. Carter could definitely copies John Travolta's moves from his cowboy day.  Beyonce is a dancer, she should have danced.  I am a heterosexual female and Beyonce's moves have gotten my bae lucky on more than one occasion.  I'd like to hear this and see Beyonce line dancing in her own one of a kind,  ineffable style. manner
This has to be the unofficial Tottenham anthem
This music sound like country music❤
Va bè che è bella, ma che video da bischero l'è, io ho aspettato tanto , Pensavo facesse di più un balletto. L'avrebbe fatto maggior parte di gente questa camminata per aver più like.
god this song is fucking annoying and i hate it
Playing dress up doesn't make you country. She is such a fraud.
Love Beyonce but look at that...naked Beyonce and pew pew.   I enjoy the shorts, fun.   Watching her, not so much.
This really isn't good.
What do Texans think?? 😂
Horrible needs a transplant
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I expected a great video with this song why not what was going through there mind 😂😂😂was money an issue n why she almost naked what does that have to do with the lyrics 😅 damn shame she could of done so much with it
so cool I love it
Get her outta here shes making country music look bad!!!
Wth is she wearing anyways , And god keep her with pop music shes definitely not country 🤦🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
What the hell did I just watch??😂😂 that's a music video? Lawd, we be skimping these days. Or is it lack of imagination now 😅😂
HER COWBOYS CARTER ALBUM IS A START OF HER RITUAL... I LOVED HER MUSIC AS A CHILD MY 1ST CD WAS Destiny's Child BUT IVE NOTICED RITUALS... AND COUNTRY DOES NOT DANCE WITH THE DEVIL!!!
this video is so stupid...for real
The Matrix symbolism is crazy 😂
This is gonna be the top song of 2024!!!!!!!!!
America please stop this madness
Sucks!
This is what passes for talent?
This is not country. Beyoncé stick to what you know.😂😂
🗑️🗑️🗑️
Oh Beyonce, don't you understand that what country music fans want is white boys sexually objectifying white girls. Combining country music with empowered black women who own their sexuality is very confusing and threatening to us. We get insecure about cultural change and progression and then we say a bunch of mocking and belittling things because we are scared and terrified to admit it. And yeah maybe we say some veiled racist stuff but let's all just pretend that race has absolutely nothing to do with this because it totally 100% absolutely does not, we swear we're not racist at all. We just seem to have very strong negative feelings about black people making country music and we don't want to think about why.  Please stop making catchy country music that we all like until we find out that a white person didn't make it. I for one am going back to listening to some real country music about white girls in cut offs climbing in white boys trucks.
Isn’t this the same chick that bitched about “cultural appropriation” for the last decade? Oh, but it’s OK to appropriate my culture huh?
WTH?
It's th3 shades for me
Fire
Ghetto country music 😂😂😂😂
Wonder how much the choreographer got paid..🤔
What I this garbage 🗑 Country? Um absolutely not.
https://youtu.be/pjn0xj1omIk?si=9mtpkx7prWBQy7JJ
It sounds cowboysongish. The problem is that she isn't whining, weeping or sorry. Like some of the great country female country singers before her, she doesn't apologize for being female. ❤
AWESOME SHE CROSSED OVER GIVE HER HER PROPS!!!!
🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💯😊
Umm... Mrs. Carter.... Please leave the country music to the professionals.... I can't stop laughing 🤣
WTF IS THIS BLASPHEMY???? EVEN SHIT IS BETTER THAN THIS TRASH! Video is as bad as the song #NotCountry
Everything about her is FAKE.  The photo shopping and possible CGI  in this video is ridiculous.
😂😅
this shit ass
Now that woman has real talent. Awesome song, girl!!!
Yo buscando la coreografía original de la Beyoncé en su video oficial y resulta que nada que ver, se la pasa con una pistola imaginaria en bucle. Amiga no te entendí.
Dude she is always naked, enough now
This song sucks, i wanna hear what she thinks about p diddy and jay z relationship and why Jay z has a island close to Jeffery epstiens
This is weird vibes it’s like she’s over it and they made her do this
Honey stick to pop music stay away from country pleaseeee
The video doesn't match the song, who is this person, can the real Beyonce come back, this entity has taken possession of her soul
✌️jerusalemhu ✌️ Neat.
This song defies the laws of country
Song doesn't match the video, it's porn why ???  Beyonce where is she? Who is this person? 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 For her, an entity has taken possession of her soul.
That's all the lord keeps giving me.
The video don't match the song.
😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
All l can say is   damm Yeehaw.
Does anyone think this song is a response to sheldon’s radical opinion song called try that in a small town???
I love this song  i also love country music
heard the whole thing this a dog water country music
Desperado. Knockers out and in her barely there underwear every time she appears in public. Like JLo  she has no class or style.
She needs to stop and the few of you that like this also need to stop, this chick is not country this song is not country and none of it will ever be country its just pop music. You people need to understand country music died in 1986 when Columbia records fired Johnny Cash from the label and was no longer recognized by the opry. All I'm saying is if you fire the godfather of country and cast him aside then that means country ended a long time ago and will never return. Further more someone needs to tell this chick what she is singing is so far from country music it isn't even funny and anyone who supports it is clearly a pop music lover and pop music is a cancer on this planet and it needs to stop. End this now and stop claiming your country Beyonce stuck to your mumble rap crap bs cause true country people don't care, we still miss Waylon, George, Johnny, Merle, Willie, hank, lefty, Conway, etc. Bottom line is Beyonce you f up so bad and made yourself and you few fans look so stupid
Misericórdia que clipe mais besta ! Literalmente!
Boring video
buena canción, feo video
Booty & the Blowfish!  Great, another one...😕🙄
How is this allowed?🤭
Its a replay
My math teacher hates this song, she says this is not real country, and Beyoncé really tried to sing country😂😂
Song but I don’t understand the video. I would’ve thought the video would’ve been her dancing or something but great song not so good video that’s
Great video 😶😶😶😶
Ahhh…make it stop! The number of DIY creators who think this is a good choice of song for their shorts…it’s terrible! Don’t know why it popped up on my recommended music mix! Awful!!!
This is not country music!
Producer: how lazy do you want this music video to be?  Beyoncé: yes
Song sounds like shit.
Nice song what a shame about the secret satanic shit with the secret eye covered crap
It's a good song but this video is CHEAP & nasty & uninteresting. Not a good look no matter how sexy you are.
Illuminati all day geez
It is just so bad! I just do not understand....
Not country music 😂
Not no but hell no
Lsten to the first 40 seconds and the last 40 second, you got it
ho ho ho
just vulgar not country
Ripoff of Franklin the turtle song from PBS.
This song rules
Who actually likes this crap 💩 😂 🤡
Country & Western does not suit her. I want to see if she can sing "The Gospel"..Every other female artist can 😏
Stick to your old style. Country is not for you.
Stick to Halo! 😢
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has dropped 3 spots to #5 for its 9th week on the Billboard Hot 100! "Cowboy Carter" remains at #1! keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! 👑🐝🤠
When creativity is non existent.  Didn't write the song.  And a shit video dosplaying her narcissism
❤
Bey needs to do what she good at... cuz this is bad... like trash bad. Damn girl I loves ya, but no... just no...
What a shit video
BEYONCE CUANDO SERÁ EL DÍA QUE VUELVAS A PERÚ,
im only here for the titties ngl the song kinda ass
One Step to the 🦿 of course I run to, left.. I will meet you in the middle and pour honey on you amen 😇🖖🏼🦿🌄👣🙏🏼🌏
😈: Let’s use Beyonce to create a new market and socially engineer black women.
Y’all have never seen a visualizer before?
I think she’s trying to copy Taylor Swift with the song, but she’s a bit long in the tooth for that, and for the nakedness. All seems a bit desperate for publicity.
Horrible sorry I love her but this is awful 😢
🤢🤮
Super disappointed with this music video!! Where is the creativity Beyoncé! This all you got for us really? Basic B? Sorry had to be said..
Trying to make country women look like hoes now
A destinies child is captivated of the circle of repitition. But Yashua reincarnated, once and for all, everyone on the cross. That's where liberation from it is, to instead be a child of Yahweh   https://youtube.com/shorts/sn1HUmeR11E?si=NxBCQL_H-TUcOa1k
This deserves a spot on country radio its literally made for country
She should of dance with this song cowgirls' cowboys' horses the whole nine, nice song but the video is super boring.
This is not country
Here we go with the nakedness.....has NOTHING to do with country music. Country music has more dignity than this!!
i always sing this school lol
Beautiful Song !
I can't stand this
She wanna be white so bad plus she giving country music a bad name 😢
31 million views.
Has she had a boob job - looks like it?
Country? 🤔🤢🤮
My budgie Cloud loves it! Lazy Duke knocking your music just made me want to listen to it more.
tf is this?
Imo the illuminate have had their moment😑smfh
J’aime beaucoup son déhanché de la part ❤ je t’adore tu sais zu temps réel Beyoncé que ce soit en actrice dans la panthère rose ou cha’tueuse j’adore jec craq7e pour tes chansons je t’oublie jamais t’es tout simple un prodige !,z
Who else here Just for the comments?😂😂
Mid non country song
It sucks
It's better than a lot of country songs, but not as good as other ones!
one piece censored be like
I get she’s Beyoncé…and can  do no wrong…but this video Is so is lazy. Hell, TikTok dancers are putting this music video to SHAME!!
Ok i checked this out just because  everybody talks about it but this ain't it....way worse than i even thought
Shity music 😅
I feel sorry that Beyoncé recieved a lot of racist sentiments from her new album.
sad cash grab
Good
Love the song but the video for me is a disappointment because she could move her body to that beat shes a goid dancer.
I hate this song so fucking much
awesome
One of the worse videos I've ever seen in my life time
Never seen a country singer have to get naked to make their song a hit. Is she selling a song or her body.?
she aint go no nipppleeesss- kevin heart
I don’t need clothes - it’s selling like warme Semmeln
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
WTF.....THIS IS VIEDO SOOOOOO BORING...LOL
She is a guest in our music even she want to be white
This ain’t country
It’s not a clip it’s a gif
This 💩 is NOT country and country fans are not saying cause she black, there are more than a few of us (black folks) that sing actual country music   Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrfO8LPRRk4&list=RDGMEMYQNnkCeucvXPZmorerFbHg&index=10
This shit is ass and not country at all
Always keep a black background... sparkle and bling as is necessary... and tho the human body is beautiful... I came here for the song I heard driving in my car... and the DJ said Beyoncé... I was like "WOW"... for real?
I heard and liked the song before I saw the video... but dayum you'd have something wrong with you if you didn't like the video
Good song but stupid video!
This is sooooooo baaad I think I'm dead inside now
RIP to the real Beyoncé 😢
Garbage
Is this really the video for this lame attempt at a country anything? GTFO 😂😂😂😂
Put some clothes on!  For Pete's sake.....
Zhore!
Bitch this is texas- bigthaplug
Thumbs up for the song. Thumbs down for the video.
El vídeo más estupido... una y otra vez haciendo lo mismo
mujer tan bella
The fuck? Same video over every part of the song. 👀💀
Is this not cultural appropriation!? Where’s the outcry? Are they playing Lainey Wilson on BET!? I think not…..
This is ghetto!
This is the worst song I have ever heard it isn't real country and how dare she she can't sing country she is r and b not country
Who care the song 🔥
Is this a joke?  That is awful!  Like any true country music fans will embrace this nonsense 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
Oh my god😮
I hate thus sing so much
I hate her so much.
fyi this is not country music its pop         no hate though
here from UNIS
Lmfao! Wth is this crap?
Love you outfit
i wonder how many times it took to get it perfect without her mabambalambas falling out
The only thing that I can see why mostly men would like this is the way she dress in this video. The song isn't very catchy for me.
I don't like any of her other songs, but this one really hits the spot!
El video 🤷🏼‍♀️
Been hearing this everywhere and had No idea it was Beyonce
Come on now 🤦🏾‍♀️ Beyonce this is a hell nawwwwww
saw many Short videos created by random peoples dancing, ,and ar much better than this video. I didn't even know about this song if it wasn't for those short videos...
This song on tour would be absolutely fire, ESPECIALLY seeing it on tour in Texas.
🎉🎉❤,.💯
Wow. This is just dog shit. Not even arguing if its country or now, just as a song... This is some dog shit.
Quero um boiadeiro. Sempre quis! Meu sonho é um Texano
She ruining county music
Is there a complete line dance for this song? I’ve only seen the first part of it. Also why are you half dressed? Not country showing all your stuff. Stay in your lane Beyoncé. Please!!!!!
Keep this shit off country radio please 🙃
Terrible
Hell is gonna suck lmao
💃💃💃💃💃
Ew the outfit, ew the song. Stay in your lane and don't think you can do country.
She had too much trust in that tape
Why do I always need to see all of her when I see her , put on some clothes damn
This is terrible! LOL...
Stop this downplay of the album videos! This is how to help you focus for listening & absorbing the team’s awesome performance 👏💪
This s*** is fire LeBron over here eating chicken salad like on glittery
😮 she has such a great voice way she have to make a video like this 🤦‍♀️. Is this the video? Or is it on repeat
Make your money I like it do your thing like allwYs
Great song!!! Stupid video
No video?
So HORRIBLE!!
If this "Visualizer" is an experiment, it failed. No one wants to see a repeating 9 sec. loop of a video. Even against the backdrop of a decent song.
This song was made in 5 minutes it's a bunch of jumbled up bs there's no heart in it
DO SOMETHING ELSE
كن زولات الحوايج احسن😐
This sond needs a so much better clipe
https://youtu.be/mrd7hEILd7Q?feature=shared
Boring 😴
The video could be the reason she’s not country. Just a thought.
Trash
Old is gold
I would be more prone to accept it as country if she could do it with clothes on and no profanity!! It’s not necessary to be accepted. Don’t know why women degrade themselves. I know I’ll get flack but it’s the truth. Let’s get our morals back in line people.
This woman cant sing for shit.
This sounds like an ai generated song
It must have cost about. 30 cents to make this video,  their is no place for pornography in COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!! THIS SONG IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ÇOUNTRY MUSIC. NO MORE,  PLEASE 😢😢😢
A diva estourou todo o orçamento do mês numa lace nova q precisou economizar no clipe.😅😅😅
Anyone from 2024
Anyone from 2024
Are these tanning bed glasses?
Finally listened to this song after reading about it, and boy is it not living up to the hype. The biggest let down I have ever heard in music haha. This says alot about the listeners in 2024, what a sad bunch of people...
Я из казахстана города Алматы. И мне эта певица со своим жилетом очень понравилась❤❤❤😊😊😊
It’s that awful she has to get her b%bs out lol 😂 🤦🏻‍♀️
I know it is a visualizer, but i got bored watching this. Also, keep on going, queen!
This goofy shit has quickly become the "buckle bunny anthem" 😂
Gracias por hacer esta canción bonita❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love the song...video is just posing with nothing on...don't get it tbh. Amazing surgery tho.
The outfit she is wearing u mm I can kinda see her you know what but you cant not say she's so beautiful though
Anyone who likes modern "country" will like this because they grew up listening to terrible pop music....which is what country music has regressed to. Any new "country" is just awful. Sorry that you couldnt make it in rap Morgan Wallen but please dont ruin country. Sorry that pop music is dead Lady whatever you are called now, Old Dominion and anyone who sounds like you...but please dont ruin country.
This is country? LOL This is awful. But then again anything "country" is just really bad pop music at this point.
Kanye and Jay Z trying to get her to top Taylor Swift. 😂
I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT STAND THIS FUCKING SONG! It’s terrible!
Umm 🤔 it's ok I guess but the video doesn't work for me
OH MY LOVE IT!!!!❤❤❤
Seriously, a serpent over just one of your eyes.
youre nit country honey, stick to being a black pop artist.
She could have zipped that jacket up.
😂
😂😂😅She is not country!!!!!!
Anyone else wonder why Beyonce is singing a song about Texas Hold em?  She obviously does not play the game and it (texas hold em) does not dominate pop culture.  Weird to me.
Biggest sell out I've ever seen. She's covering her own ass in case the right wing takes over.
This video is boring and just is out right vulgar. She's doing the same thing repeatedly. They could have introduced a new line dance. People playing poker. Anything but this. I have no problem with crossover music and if this to make any statement referring to different races in country music, you are a little late. Anyone who knows country music history knows its roots began in black musical history and it's awesome. Don't care for the carriages song. This one is better but come on. The black community of country music artists has been around long before Beyonce'. The 3 gals that wrote a sequel to "Jolene" are amazing. I grew up with Charlie Pride. I never heard one song he did that I didn't love. Neil McCoy is another. Sing country and do it well but don't act like you are the 1st and only because you are not.
LOVESSS SONG❤❤❤ 0:25
❤❤❤❤
Wonder how she gonna play them cards when the Feds pullup?
why are you naked
Video = absolutely  a shit  and a big  one !!!!!!!!!!!!!! i  will never  understand  WHY in  our days the singers should be naked ?????????????????????????????????????
Garbage
This was a visual, it's not the actual video, this was a tease video
Best country song since shania!!
Worst song ever made
Th  e
Nope nope nope!
When did Beyoncé become a Borg??
Perfect song for young sheldon 😂
Yeah
Wtf is a vizualizer
🎉top
Sta? ☹️
This shit sucks!!!
Song is ass
This is the laziest music video I have ever seen.
If I hear this song one more time, I'll    go insane 🙉😖 God it's overplayed in the apps
Beyoncé saved country music 🙏🏼🙌🏼
Horrible video but great song!
Damn those men, always sexualizing women.
This song is horrible, and the video is worse .
She stoled this song
This is 🗑️ compared to BigXthaPlug- Texas
Ppl who keep complaining about the visuals, u were the SAME fkn ppl complaining about NO visuals for act i. She gave us something to better helo us feel each songs vibe and it still aint good enough????
Please stop
#WHYYOUSHOWINGYOURBOOBS
You'd think with that fast song there would be some dancing??
Country + Beyonce = No Bueno....I don't  blame George straight for being pissed.
🖕🖕🖕🖕Don’t come over here to country music just because hip hop is going down take your ass back😜😝🖕🖕🖕
Lol🎉 black
This shit is ass 😭
This ain't country
Keep this OFF country radio.
Don't tell me 🎼🎵🤠
No.1 I almost got flashed too many times No.2 this video ain’t good No.3 the songs trash  No.4 listen to sabaton
Trash
Stupid video put some clothes on
this song isn't very good
No thank you
temazo
Turning country into trash outfit😮
meh
She is a demon 😅
Wait I've heard this music before, oh thats right.....Hey It's Franklin.......
Hola biyonse
Ladies and Gentleman, the most overplayed and overhyped song of the year (No hate towards Beyonce herself)
This sound like pop or rnb not country at all it does sound a Lil bit like country and rap an pop
This is a terrible song and video
Boring music video
I would see her wearing beautiful dresses & singing beautiful songs like Whitney Houston did. Not Country music. She doesn't need to act provocative. She is georgeous lady.
I do this I’ll say the same just like in the first one
Cover up For hell  sakes
https://youtu.be/jjsIz_5e9hA?si=B1ptwL4CLwrvjmY-
Disgusting...
this song is dogshit
This is terrible 😞
This is a mockery
thats all the video shows?  music aint that bad though,
Oof
We see our line dancing love us our country music beyond beautiful Beyonce distiny child love us our 666😈😈😈
Love our variety music 666😈😈😈
Why do  they  have  her  doing  the  same  thing  over  over
Nope
I'm not sure what all the fake rage is about. I don't remember outrage when a gay black man wrote a country song that was widely popular and went viral. This is getting out of hand. Music transcending to all genres of music is a good thing.
Oh no
😂
0:09 BRO NAH AYO
MISS QUEEN HAS MORE TRUST IN THAT VEST THAN I HAVE WITH MYSELF
We are suppose to take her seriously about her country song....but country music usually doesn't have the B word in it and ya boobs hanging out...I hope she doesn't continue to try country music.
I like the song but the video is boring after awhile. I’ll add to the road trip tunes though!
This "visulizer" is stupid. Her outfit is ridiculous and certainly does not do anything to promote the song.
Nice 🙂
B-O-R-I-N-G. 😴
Garbage
Mentions Texas, tornadoes & dive bars…must be a country song then.  Glad I don’t listen to country so I won’t ever have to hear this song again.
Viola❤
😂😂😂😂😂 żenada budżet teledysku powala jak i sama piosenka śmiech 😂😂😂światowej sławy piosenkarka nie nie 👎
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ummmm.  I expect a little more choreography from her.   This is the worst !  I’m from the actual country.  We’re talking Right on the bayou in the swamps of Louisiana. Rural agricultural area.  Like where you gotta drive 30 mins just to a corner store and this song makes me feel cringey…….   Just my opinion.   There’s a chick on here that does shorts of herself dancing in the woods in a friggin Bigfoot costume and her choreography was hecka better.  😂🤣🤣
Poker Beyoncé
This song is so trash why does it even exist and being played on the radio all day
The fuNck
Bellissima canzone!!!❤
Love you Beyoncé biggest fan listing to you silence I was 3🎉😂❤❤❤
This song sucks
Porn for YouTube Kids
Beyonce has no nipples
Really needs a body face planting when she shoots to her left for that extra silliness.
NYC Ghetto voice in a rubber suit and orangutan "boobs"
I am beyonceeeeeeeyyyy
スタイルがいい❤
Am I the only one thinking of a sexed up Borg!?
Super
21 black jack god 😂❤
This=shit
Trash
Never heard so much bullshit at once  Producer: The mass will love it anyway don’t worry
❤❤❤❤❤
Heard about the song a few weeks ago
Zobaczcie kamery a r net
What The Hell Did I Just Watch! If it Don't Sound like God it AintbGod! If it Don't Sound like Country! It Ain't Country! This Sounds like Gay House music!
No, I only like good music.
#Mrs.Carter. #Texas
UF LO MEJOR DEL AÑO EN MUSICA EN INGLES, CHINGON RITMO MUSICA E INTERPRETACION, BRAVO
So now i can see why so many people are saying this isn't really a country song, cause it really isn't a country song its a pop song with country lyrics in it , but its a good pop song by a pop singer
15 kilos over weight
Not her flashing us
Ever hear of Black Hawk Down? This is Black Hoe Down.
She has no bra???
Put clothing on!
My god if that's country I'm Ronald Reagan,stick to your pop crap Beyonce,never liked her
Muck
Disgusting
I don’t understand all the hype with her
I came here to steal the music from the reprobaters Tune it back for the remnant
WTF is this?  Reminds me of the theme song from The Jeffersons or something.  🤣  Same vibe.
Am I going crazy or is this video looped? 😅
I turned on the actual radio for the first time in a while today. And I heard this garbage for the first time. I didn't know who the singer was. Or the name of the song. But I found it. Tell Beyonce to go the f on somewhere. Take Luke Bryant with her and quit singing country. Gosh damn she sucks.
Pas trés recherché ce clip !!!!!!!😂😂😂😂 ça manque d'inspiration tout ça! A moins que ce  ne soit pour nous montrer sa poitrine siliconée 😆😆😆
❤❤
Stupid video! Waste of three minutes. Not very creative!
Indecency wasn’t necessary 😮
Apparently a black artist still needs naked breasts to attract attention.
Video: sucks  Song: sucks
My favourite song from her
Ppl moaning about video being on repeat who cares Beyonce is a singer who can dance but end of the day u turn that tune sitting in your car that's getting volume to the max an excellent tune puts a smile on anybodys face
Can we just keep turning “The Weekend” songs to country instead?
QG
Wttttffff is thisss😂😂😂😂
Ich verstehe nicht warum MTV das Video zensiert 🤔
I love this song 🎵🎵🎵🎵
lol Carrie Underwood my respect shot out I respect all artists they sensitive about they shit 😂😂😂😅 we all know where we came from  God do shit for a read
She bad accept  it video basic classy not insulting… her tone on track good she not trying to out sing anyone she needs Kelly Clarkson on a track and that other blonde chick that went to millionaire status she was on American idol, no disrespect. She was trailer park and she said it herself. she has blonde hair and blue eyes maybe Carrie somebody but her voice is beautiful.
Beyoncé you are a great singer don’t matter what any body says you are the best and a gorgeous singer  🙏🤗
This is one of those songs where you shouldn't watch the video
Who are here in 2024 april?😄🥰
This probably would be more famous and loved if they actually placed some effort on the visuals, but maybe i would be proven wrong with the twitter people
HOW MUCH DID THAT FEW SECONDS COST?!?!?!
rarely seen such a boring video 🥱
Scheiß Video
Wonder how famous she will be when her husband is exposed as a fudge stabber in the rich black gay men scandal the diddy started
Beyoncé is terrible.
That's not country music it's garbage!
Soft boy era Drizzle Drizzle this ain't TEXAS
Beyonce went outlaw! Is the rest of this album this good?
The most boring music video Iv ever witnessed!! Absolute garbage…. Catchy song for TikTokers I guess and that’s all it’s good for..
❤
😈 i cant wait to take you down down down down down
Reminds me of timber.
This ain’t Country FOH
How much tell
putain c'est mauvais!
Nope
This is ass. Stick to rap please🤦‍♂️ country music was good until the year 2000
I hope she didn't pay to have this clip produced.
I have no good words for this garbage
What a bad role model for her kids 🙄
This song trash af🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏼
Nothing country about this. Sucks. Darius Rucker did a great job going from one genre to country. She needs to stay in her lane
this song is so fucking ass
Lol this is far from country music as it gets, and put some dang cloths on!
i already have to accept that most country music singers are pretending to be cowboys and usually come from massive wealth. but this is just a weird stretch. she might as well do bag pipes or renaissance faire music next.  its a no from me dog.
Can't get 3:57 back. Who wrote this a 3 yr old. Lyrics so elementary.
Um….
This is not good. Wtf🫣
This shit is bad.
I think she is marvelous 🎉
So horrible. Who is she in this video a saloon girl in the worst bar in town?
Ye hooo
Okay, does anyone have a blanket?
this song is annoying and sucks, not worth the 4 minuets of my time.
Beyonce has gone to the country side
JUST HORRIBLE... PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STICK TO YOUR SATANIC RITUALS. COUNTRY IS NOT FOR YOU.
Worst song I’ve ever heard stop
Would of loved to see Beyonce dance country with this song ❤
I don't like her so I won't be watching the video
This is stupid.
😂
was this written by AI?
This music is  ridiculously absurd an this has to be the worst album in the history of Albums
AI director, choreographer, casting manager, post-production editor, and gaffer.
this song fkn sucks!! stick to your music and leave country alone!!
Um....dumb.
Songs ok  but video is incompleted😮
Countryhasmore cloths songs good
Patch on eye signal
Love the song! hate the video!☹ Why even bother with the same step repeatedly? Waste of time but easy money for videographer!🤮
So now she's a porn star? What the hell is this supposed to be?
Sus
Y las nenas tan aireadas como porque?😅😅😅
Hell no it’s not Texas it’s killafornia
I can’t watch this anymore. About 1:35 in, I’m done. It’s not good
I love her song but this one ainda good why they have her doing the same thing
Why did she remake the theme song to Franklin the Turtle?
Why did she even put anything on she already naked. She is a disgrace i am glad my children are grown. No child or adult  should see that.
Got be the worse music video and song in history😂
nice glorification of guns Bey.
Can someone gift her a shirt. A button down Texas shirt. Would look sexy and cute. Looking at other women’s boobies is boring never appropriate. Her music will sell anyway so she doesn’t need to be this naked.
Real country people don't drive a Lexus 😂😂😂😂
Que canción más bonita y que malo el videclip
I love you so much
Garbage 🗑️
Que aburrido video ahora entiendo por que le.dieron mejor versión los tic toker
🤮🤮🤮
why is she so so tacky now i dont cate if the beehive come at me i said what i said
A flash of the breast always keeps the man watching
Lady gaga called. She wants her eye wear back
I regret landing here.
The fact that people think this is “country music” is hilarious. Actual country music has unfortunately been dead for a while, but stupid people think if you mix pop and or rock with a different genre then that is ok to do… it’s not. So if you want to revive country then sing country music the way it was intended. Keep the rap crap and rock out of it.
Video made the song boring!
Great. Now I have to clear my watch history 😂
What a stupid Video......
" CHEAP "
This is probably the worst song I’ve ever heard and I’m from Texas I don’t care if y’all agree but In my opinion it’s awful
Hypocrite of the year goes to.... BEYONCÉ.  After all the years of her stating : they steal our culture... lol heres a heaux half dressed tryna look and sound country. Dear Dixie Chicks, we found something worse than you and Taylor Swift in country music 🤣😭💀
Terrible!
Love the song but the video really sucks!
Kome je ovo bezveze neka lajkuje
All we get is walk, shoot, repeat?  I wanted to see Beyoncé dance in a cowboy hat!! Boo hoo hoo hoo. 😂😂😂
One of the best songs I ever heard! Great job, Beyoncé! This song is off the chart! Should definitely win song of the year! I just love it!
Is it just me or did she copied the tune of this song from an old song called midnight rider by the allman brothers band and then mixed it and remixed it and made her own
She mamaged to make white girl country music
This is not a country song
Why do female singers today have to get their baps out? It just cheapens a really good singer and turns the video into a bit of trashy porn. I notice that one of the music channels deemed it necessary to blank out her chest. They must have thought it a bit porny too. As well as that, repeating the same thing again and again is boring. Not to mention the connection with guns. Wrong on all levels!
Record is shit.
This is the WORST video I have ever watched in my entire EXSITENCE!!!!!  You laid your cards down....... 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
If this is country music then we're fucked 😂
Terrible song, cheap low budget video.  And no money left for normal clothes for this artist...
What a load of crap. Boring. I fast forwarded to stop the misery
This sucks.
Le hubiera hechado más ganas al video 😢con una buena coreografía el vestuario referente a TEXAS😢
This song is ridiculous and annoying
Country music my ass.
this video is demonic as hell, no pun intended.
So this is country now 😂.... Ok
She's beautiful and everything but the over-sexualization in the music industry is just ridiculous at this point.
What a joke. Leave the country music to the people that don't have to have their books on display to sell a song.  Pathetic!
I dont like the video
Beyonce is such a pos, and so is anybody who supports her.
SUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20 seconds before I puked and nice eyes not😂
Ummmm no
Some people really never listened to an album on YouTube lol tons of rappers have visualizers for their cover art. Yall dumb as hellll 💀
She forgot to get dressed before stepping out.
Nice jugs but song is just idk
Trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️
Gosh looks like Beyoncé pulls it off again 👍💪👊👏❤️ What a legend there’s just no stopping her
Lame AF.
Good song but I don’t want to look at her boobs all the time
Love song
Having boobs is not an indication of talent.
A 10 dollar striper cam do a better job , and in San Antonio TX  that's a pretty rich bitch,  absolutely garbage , what shekelstein thought this was a good idea,  greed has a limit mr.Happy Merchants.
OMG!! How do people not understand that this is not the music video. It is a visualizer which means it is one shot from the upcoming video to give you a sneak peek as an opportunity for the song to be released. Seriously people stop hating when you don’t know what you’re talking about.
She's so NASTY!  🤮
I will never discord a daddy did me.
Suitable spider babies
Are those rich people making fun of us  or what is this?
Do not by tell me that you don’t do the same old , same old sometimes too?  If only I can go to work and just start, pause, repeat!  And get paid!!! She is a genius!
If you done it with just a virtualizer Oh boy She won.  I am still in a better position than you 🖤
This is the worst thing I ever seen. the song is terrible, she doesn’t have the talent or voice to pull off country music
Nice bobies
I want to know the answer to that question to why is she doing the same thing over and over again
Not a bad song, IF you ignore the video.
Pure rubbish 🙄
Oh the Choreography…… !? They realy couldn’t give an Eff…!?
This ain't texas ain't no hold'em lay are cards down down down down😂
Save money
What a shit video!👎👎👎👎👎👎
wtf
She just got em out pretty much
what a way to dress Just be a nude model and call it a day.
De la grosse daube
No.
chouette chanson 🎉
those two beautiful .............shots are fake .........
Wow what a terrible video for such a great song. Boo.
The worst lyrics in the world
This song was ruined by TikTok’s and shorts on YouTube, and this music video just sucks, why can’t anyone be creative anymore? You know you have plenty of money to hire a good company to make your music videos good, but I guess you choose not too.
TRASH
The most uneventful song
If ain't texas which state or country reference too
I have heard this in stores (WM) and the radio....its sped up and doesnt sound as good and they fuckin hatin on the low!!!!
clip sex ?
All I can say about this song is YUCK.
No. No. No!  Kenny: No when to fold 'em.
This is possibly the most vile music video I’ve ever seen. I liked the song before I saw this. Just gag me 🤮
Most boring video ever but the song is catchy
Girl, put your clothes on 🤦‍♀️
THIS AINT AFRICA!
No shade to any artist of color trying to come out in country music,  but all this noise about Beyonce, what about giving mad props to artist like Nelly years ago?🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
bouncy is a failed wannabe country "singer"
Don’t like country don’t like Beyonce much, but somehow it’s catchy. Video stupid as hell though
I'd rather care for a dead dog
This ain't real country
Give her a chance; she’s so catchy! 😎👍💚❤️😊
Boring video and put some clothes on.
U call that country sing Tell to go. Back to what she knows best  that R & B SHE NEEDS TO GO BACK HOME
Beyoncé is good at writing songs😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊😊
Trash
As generic as it gets
Who is here after watching UNIS' cover of Texas Hold 'Em  🔽                         🔽
She needs to turn herself in for human sex trafficking
Please stay away from “country”👎
Reginald McDonald said God bless and keep up the great work out there coming from Jackson Mississippi ❤️🙏☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤.  ❤❤❤.        ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤ ❤ 🎉
Why is she singing country half naked? And No thanks she AIN'T got a country voice or vibe. This totally stinks like a 3 week olds could egg after Easter that wasn't found. Stick with your original genre Beyonce. It sounds better
You'll know the difference between a visualizer and a videoclip?
Wow so shit. Thought it was some obscure artist and not Beyonce. Pretty shitty even for shit. Lmao so bad
WHY IS THIS OLD LADY NAKED?
This song sucks!
Um NO! Stay away from country. You ain't no American country.
selena gomez - lose you to love me was also shot on iPhone 11
Next song this ain’t country
heard better karaoke
This shit is honestly better than morgan wallens pop country bullshit
Alguém  pode me ajudar? Preciso descobrir  o mome de uma música. Que a beyonce tem um clipe  que se passa em um escritório  a coreografia é  bem sexy. E parece se passar em um tempo antigo.  Aparece um homem  que parece  ser um detetive    Me ajudem😢
What the actual Ffff!!!! Our world is retarded
Put some clothes on
She shouldnt even be making country music like tf was her jolene remake
I always admired Beyonce and her dancing skills. This us all she could think of to do for this 'song'? She looks like a trashy cyborg. 🙄😁
Having Beyoncé doing the same thing is such a lazy editing 😂 and choreography
This bs is number one now what a joke lmao
It’s literally a loop of dark symbolism. The two fingers up, two fingers down is the “two finger solute”. Also the snake HAS to be included. The all seeing eye with the other one covered. It’s in plain sight lol  "It contains all these binary opposites - above and below, part animal, part human. Male and female," says Greaves.
This is country, why crap on Texas?is this satirical
This song doesn't make any sense
Omg
this song is so ass
Governo of poker
How many the other American did you kind kill, ( slaves=blacks), to be free Native something, the dead
This is country???  Not! She is taking her style of vulgar singing and dress and attempting to make a "country" genre of a song using her style. Country is not vulgar like her singing.  Never seen Dolly singing like this. She would have to call Jolene a few vulgar names and add a few more foul slurs. This is not country.
stupid
Those are longest fingers I have ever seen and the lowest care factor for a music video
Someone kil me
No thanks.
Just a walk into country music pointing her finger gun is all she needed I guess
Grat song I always  sing it ❤😊😊
Anyone who says country music isn't cheap pandering has never seen this
Probably the worst song and video I've ever seen and heard.
The fact that she was standing there the whole time😂😂
Só fica nisso o vídeo? Sério? Kracas que bosta!
She said this ain't Texas like what bro that is weird
Man who the hell even listens to her songs
Because they have no imagination
Wow, no respect for the genre at all.
This isn’t country George strait is!
YouTube : que cherches tu ici  Moi : les enfants guetto kids d'Ouganda m'ont dirigé ici 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Beyonce' just she's every woman. I am so proud and amaze by her🎉😊😊😊
Yikes.
Love this ❤
Evie
UTTER TRASH! Demon in the matrix!
Bringing her vulgarity to country music. .. 😢
Tani teledysk który robi dla niej miliony 😂
They have to cancel this song is the worst I had ever heard a song like this I HATE IT 😡😡👹💀😊🤬
Beyoncé ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This might be the dumbest thing ever 😂
I think the creativity for the video was cut short.....real short.
Is she promoting her song??
Ready! From now on I'm addicted to watching this Beyoncé viewer several times a day. I love it 🇧🇷👑❤
I present you the most overated song ever
Girl you may be from Texas…but you are not country. Stick to what you know. Not this. No wonder The Grand Ole Opery banned her. No girl this ain’t it!
Don’t quit you day job. You ain’t Country.
She has goddess' body
This sucks.
I actually love this song
Straight up Fuc/<ing garbage.
ONE EYE
Lmfaooo this shit is TRASHHH
This isn’t a bad song but I don’t feel like I’m listening to country when this played. It was more of confusion in my mind
I just came here to dislike this song (thanks for ruining country)
It's so dry😂
You ain't country, just cause your from Texas. Go sit down down down down down.
This is horrible
She got the devil I
What's up with the one eye symbolism
only dont like the way she looks.... somehow doesn,t fit the song....    too naked...
Ugh...
Ma mère a dit on mais ça 😂
She gonna be locked up soon in the Diddy case, and i cant wait. Her and J
Listen to phenomenal Beyonce's voice,look at here amazing body and fantastic secret hiding eyes...Than you will understand,why Miss Beyonce is repeating it.Everything it's for you music lovers.😊🙂
Stoopidest lyrics ever.. not every singer is intelligent!
Hey c'est Franklin!
haha, adding a banjo and calling it Texas Hold Em don't make it a country song, it sounds like R&b with banjo playing in the song........
Niye kadınlar vucutlarını sergıleme ihtiyacı duyar sesı zaten çok güzel
Ummm talking about poker, tornados  and country dancing does not make your song country. Cheap.
Wat😢
This is just painful lol. Definitely not a country song. She should stick to her genre. Also, this clip repeating over and over is just plain annoying.
Wow this is awful. Just cuz you throw twang on it doesn't make it country. Still pop music.
Whats a visulizer? Is it like the loop video you see on Spotify? So artists dont create music videos anymore? N'aww i came here looking for one. This is boring. Songs crap.
Nice, a video of Beyonce doing satanic "as above, so below" symbolism for the entire thing. She isn't a part of any cults though.
AFD            AFD                 AFD                AFD                  AFD
And she says she is Christian while walking around half naked...
AFD AFD AFD AFD AFD AFD
AFD AFD AFD AFD AFD AFD
How does anyone actually like this song
What a strange video!
Horrible song.
Well good thing they didn't spend a lot of money on the video because Jay-Z had to pay 20 million dollars to get this wannabe country ho on the country music station. Disgusting.
I actually think they made this song with an a.i genorator and the vid 😂
J'aurais aimé une danse country
This is an abomination. Nothing about it is country. Fake everything too glam too porn too Hollywood. I could say oh so much more not  worth my time and it’s too offensive to my beloved Texas.
Beyoncé trying to sing country is like a white guy from the richest part of the suburbs tryna rap about the thug life. Let’s be real
😍😍🔥🔥🔝🔝🤤🤤😘😘😘
music nice 👌👌🙏🙏
Is this real? Crap song and crappier video. Pretty sad from someone that used to have talent
WTH the breast exposure?
I've been hearing this bullshit it's fucking annoying
Wtf would you just stop your old and no one likes you anymore get over it
Que video más tonto
TEXANS don’t dress like that! Please when y’all making a video don’t make it this skimpy 😢
Vest has more trust than showing privates😭
Dumb it don't many any sense
This could be her last song with her in hiding with Jay Z
Niceses contry song i,ve herd in a long time. Love it.
Show 🥰🇧🇷🇧🇷✌️
Why does nobody like her song this is such a good song don’t be mean love from iceland
This is not your song
Look at my tits! So tired of it in music....
Isn’t anyone talking about the vest she wearing? 💀
🤮
Nope!!! Absolutely not loving this at all. She's NOT country music at all.
She'd be much prettier if she wore some darn clothes.
How is this "Country Music"? ...just sounds like another usual Beyonce song
OMG this is so bad, and why did she feel the need to dress like that, or undress might be better said. No, just no. Beyonce, maybe take a look back to your roots and stop reinventing yourself.
why she naked wtf she joining the independent wakanda forever womens gang
Quand est ce que quelqu'un dira que ce clip est nul 😮🤔😬
Tesla headquarters is in Texas this maybe good for the new marketing campaign 🎉
Who got sacrificed for this one ??
I actually like this song, better than most of her other songs which can seem aggressive. I’m not sure if I’d classify it as country? Maybe a pop song with country elements🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s good!
This is just awful
Did no one see the chest filter bugging out?
Жаль, что даже для такой певицы, нужно раздеться, что-бы привлечь внимание
Beyonce is finally white enough to make country music.
shit song
This has to be the most boring video I’ve ever seen from a talented artist who could make the visuals as stunning as her vocal talent. That dumb gun on repeat while she’s more than half naked? Not enough to draw anyone in (except maybe wankers hoping for a wardrobe malfunction).
Team sus 👇      boobs out😂
Dumb song
Bruh this is like a rapper going over to jazz
This is horrendous.
😮😮😮
Music nowadays is sad if you can’t make it copy it
Beyoncé coming back outta to release the worst song ever 🔥🔥
Is there a way to block a song?
Another desperate waste.
Music (from 1 to 10) its a 9, the videoclip its a 2. I guess a big celebrity can afford to do stupid things at this stage... Sad.. we would have aspected a nice videoclip for such a nice song.
Great, another icon going “country” because she is oh so clearly “celebrating” and “contributing” to that yeehaw agenda (corporate wigs.)
can she sing with clothes on?
Like this song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Trash!!!!!!
Capital N for No
Where’s her shirt? That’s weird.
This song is just awful.
Boring video.
Yuk what a disgrace to country music. Go back to your roots and stay there you are so cheap
Why is she dressed like a stripper ?
There is a lot of trust in that top😮
yee-haw
😊 0:23 Who the hell has a lexus In the country
Beyoncé is an incredible singer and an incredible talent… But I feel bad for the people who actually believe that this is country.
wtf lol
How disappointing
Could have done some great. Instead a video of you half naked addressing nothing. Pretty is everything you are not!
I wanna say that is the worst song ever made. She needs to stop singing country. She’s not a country star. She needs to stay in her lane.
This ain't country. Just don't. I like her other music but this ain't it.
Congratulations you just made a GIF
Que desperdicio 😅 de video 😂😂😂 me quedé con las ganas de verla bailar 😏😏😏😑
This is trash
Screw this song, and curse it for being so overused and annoying
This shit aint country
Te amo beyonce eres mi vida 😢❤❤❤❤❤
This by far the cheesiest country video & song I have ever seen. This is sooo not what country music is about 🤷‍♀️
Great song...worst video ever!
She tickled the taint of America 😊
Please leave county music alone
Beyoncé with no clothe son again, hey Bea we have seen it all, perhaps put some clothes on for a change.
Stick to your own genre.   Just because you are no longer relevant in your genres doesn't mean you should torture the rest of us.
She stinks at country and should stick to what she thinks can do but not cou try
Merlin
“Anybody got tape? I forgot a shirt”
Somebody came up with a dance to this, she couldn’t be bothered?
Is this ai or something?
Who's song is that???
I’m a little disappointed. I was under the impression that Beyoncé would actually do the dance.💃🏿
Just remember she trade marked the name of her kid.
🤣🤣🤣 garbage 🤣🤣🤣
One of the worst songs to be released in recent history
🇧🇷❤️❤️
This is a disgrace … our children are see in this the hell you thinking, oh wait it is hell that this ideology is even ok for a grown man to see ,, you not attractive Beyoncé  get over yourself
IF I HEAR THIS SONG ONE MORE TIME AM GONNA RIP MY EARS OUT*
Those glasses with the snake wrapped around her eye are so fierce…
Shity video clip it's her smallest problem now
Repetitive bad music video, ruins the whole vibe of the song, half naked like girl are you ok, and just 0/10 in general🥱 so lazy just repeating a boring video over and over till the end of the song!
That shit is trash 🚮
This sucks lol😂
If it wasn't for the outfit I would've been out of here..
Realy Bad clip I ever Seen 😮😮😮😮 j'aurai préféré voir la chorégraphie qu'on voit partout sur Tic Toc 😮😮😮😮
Whoring 😢
I was wondering if she was auditioning to be a stripper because of the way she's dressed in the way she's walking???🤷‍♂️
Why is the left eye covered? Seriously, ummm, the Antichrist, your greatest master or savior, Freemasonry, deviation and control over the world and minds, you people must shun the likes of these devils.
BeyHive! Buy and stream "Cowboy Carter" we are 7k units behind spending a 2nd week at #1 on the Billboard 200! 👑🐝🤠
30 Million views ✔️
This is no Country music at all.   Listen to the lyrics 😂😂
It's ironic that so many of Beyoncé's fans are the same people who complain that black women are oversexualized in America...when Bey contributes to that problem immensely
Does she really have do that to be popular?  A little sexy is sexier than all icing and no cake. Yuk.
Really this is what you produce and teenages to follow not a good example
OUCH!
Great Song - but the video is not about country music.
If my wife walks outside like that, she’s no longer my wife.
Nice voice but why can't we make it kid friendly?
She's no country singer
Love Beyonce
The look is giving Matrix hooker vibes 😂
is this suppose to be country..?
Horrible! I would rather listen to Jlo sing country she looks ridiculous
She has more trust in that jacket than I have in my life
Ick 🤢
"Oh yall just hate it cause she's black" is the running theme in these comments. .. but what you don't realize is that we hate it because it sucks lol..i mean listen to the lyrics of this song..wtf is there to like about it? Is it the oh so clever and timeless line "dont be a bitch,  take it to the floor" or perhaps the ingenious snippet about the "dive bar we always thought looked nice" which makes zero fucking sense.  It's a world full of simple sheep and Beyonce its cashing in on it. She doesn't write her own songs,  doesn't play an instrument,  has a mediocre voice at best.  I can go into any southern Baptist church and walk out with 3 black girls with better vocals than Beyonce.
How do you show that much Boob and no Nipple? 🤔
This is not country and would greatly appreciate it if she would keep my state out her mouth.
This doesn’t sound like country at all. Shits trash
Worst video I’ve seen in my life
Nasty
Sorry to disappoint you, hon, but you will find a lack of Lexus' in Texas.
I love this song
Esta rola vale pura berga
I’m here for the hate comments
This isn't country lol
This is hot 🗑️... Disappointed... No drip, boooorrringgg, out of date with modern times. going back to morgan wallen "Thinking bout me" & "Wasted on You".  As a black 35 yr old, Morgan got me listening to country music. Now I like white horse by Chris Stapleton and save me the trouble by Dan and Shay. Yea, I'm a country fan now and I'm from NY. Beyonce this ain't it, I don't know how this is #1 on the charts, but you need to holla at Jigga and offset for some drip when it comes to your new lane. This is not it. You tryna be dolly parton? Wtf? Get on the modern drip. Back to wallen
is it me or is this just another example of a world gone mad long ago here we have 4 minutes video of a half naked beyonce that 26.9+ million pepole in the whole world see..im no expert but something here just aint right to me...
I love you Beyoncé 😭😭😍😍🥰 you can always sing dance 🥰 you are so beautiful talented woman 🥰🥰🥰👍
Un mot:j'adore! Voir des artistes aller là où on ne les attends pas forcément,c'est génial!!❤❤❤❤
Good song, but she could be wearing more!
Garbage do not ever make country music again
Ruined the song trash
So nice❤❤❤
Worst song ever...
Jadore cette chanson ❤❤
Cuz she wack and someone wrote this song
J ' adore Beyoncé ❤😂😊😅
I listen to so much on Instagram that I get sick 😖
boucney lady is human garbage, and you cant change my mind
WELL ONE THING IS FOR SURE...THIS AINT COUNTRY!!  HURTS TO LISTEN TO IT
WOW!!! Go ahead girl 😅
Worst Beyoncé song ever
Ground Hog Day music video! lol
Why do you do it over and over the whole song
This song is horrible!
Garbage
I wish that People would Stop Hating on Beyonce Country Songs because she can sing the Yellow Pages. May God Continue to Bless Her in all that she Does ❤
Black excellence. 😊
Warom doet ze het zelfde
Pathetic put some clothes on
I love it❤
I had this on 8-track. Ah, memories...
This song is fucking annoying
Such a good song ❤❤❤
A real cowboy wouldn't last long in the wild wild west dressed like this. It was a rugged life.
Country people and Lexus 😂😂😂
Love love love this song❤❤❤❤❤
🔴
Banjo for the win!
This is my favorite song 🎵
I really love this song but the vedio i dont understand😂😂😂😂
Was waiting for the big moment chorus and it just doesnt happen? This is her big single offf this album?? Meh
As a man from south Alabama (go head call me racist I do not care) this is absolutely positively not country music whatsoever it sounds like she trying not to shit her pants the whole time. The end
Really bad so she doesn't make enough money doing her regular music so she needs to come over and ruin country music,
❤️❤️😣👌😍😍😍
Stay in your lane ho 😂😂😂😂😂
Én a rádióban hallotam ezt a számot meló közben , és most kerestem rá , és most látom hogy magyar, nagyon tetszik 😊
Why she not dancing🤔
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😙❤️‍🔥🥵😗😘🤗😊
So... are we just going to ignore the illuminati symbolism all over this video? The Serpent covering one eye? The 'As above, so below' hand genatures?... No? Nobody?  😳
Why is there even a video??? This is soo incredibly stupid. I'm disappointed. I love Beyonce. She could have done better
Songs sh1t and whys she got t1ts out wake up people
Beyonce t'es ma femme,je t'aime mais là j'avoue que c'est nu a  chier
Suckssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow they are bring Country to a low gutter stand. This sucked!!!!!!
Daughter will be soooo proud of her mum.  What a great role model.
That is stupid and disrespectful who does she think she is. I can not stand her. If she thinks that is country she so wrong.
Most boring video
This is country? We are doomed,
Sick disrespectful
🤠 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🌿🌿
💛☀️✨💛☀️✨💛☀️✨💛☀️✨
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
One of the worst songs, EVER!!!
Sorry but that is not country...  slower pop/rockabilly type music with country WORDS maybe, but it is not country... I know country...  as Merle, George, Alan, and others are shaking their heads...  just sayin...
This isn’t country all the basic white chicks can fight me but it really isnt country
She really thinks this is country
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I wonder how many nip slips there were before they finished the video
i always curious about beyonce tits
THIS is what is No 1?? SERIOUSLY..THIS  IS HER NO 1?
Éclater clip 😂
NO TEXANS WERE HARMED IN THIS VIDEO....
Hey its Franklin
Surely she could do better!
Yea. Damn, boring video on repeat.
Why She Always Half Naked???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaquero  Texans owe majority of their heritage to Mexico.  Before there were 'cowboys', there were Vanqueros.
Uma nova versão de uma grande cantora internacional romantica e músicas dançante parabéns as suas novas músicas tbm sussesso na sua voz sempre cantora 💤💃💤
Elle s'est pas fait ch... pour son clip 😂
Would
Extremely mid song, overhyped solely because its Beyonce.
Worst song doesn’t deserve to be anywhere near the top
Candidate for most annoying song of the year. Go ahead and hide my comment YouTube algorithm but its true.
Langweilig😱🤔💯👉👎👎👎
Why is she half naked? 😮
is the song good?  no    is the video? yes  then i get bored and move on to heabest video game MV ever
Jay-Z is EXTREMELY-BLESSED!
The song is good, though damn
It is okay... but I went to relisten to "Redneck Woman" after listneing to this.
i just think beyonce would have more of a prominent country soul twang in her vocal timbre if she sung about the luisiana.  new orleans is something of an egypt u guys know, right ? dont u dare hide that. don't hide in texas.
IM ALL IN!!!!!
This shit is garbage
I didn’t know “country” women dressed tacky! Class not ass or in your case boobs hunny! Not impressed
Wtf did I just watch
This is garbage !!!!
talentless has-been
This is not country
that vest is holding the universe...
This is not countrry. I'm not even into country like that.
This is the dumbest song I ever heard. What happened to country.
This has to be the worst video ever made. Is the song somehow worse? I can’t decide..
This song dance with me ❤
It's time to MUTE BEYONCE..! Im UNSUBSCRIBING and Im from HOUSTON 39..  I was a loyal fan, but not nomore.. tell y'all the truth she takes and dont give We talking down her SIS... #MUTEBEYONCE
The fact she should have acted country before r&b ,rap etc don't start Byonce
this not country
Omg really you are not country from a country girl my entire life you are joking right 😂
Ignore the tits guys and listen.🤫.
Songs better then the video that's for sure
If I never hear this song again...
This ain’t country.
Not very impressed.
This is not country basically seem like she just want to be naked but it’s sound like pop
The fact that you can market THIS as "country music," and have millions of people believe you, is absurd. I don't know if I should laugh or cry.
This aint Texas just like this aint Beyonce's body. Altho the song is catchy the video is skank - appropriate
ANYTHING FOR YOU, BEYONCÉ
New thing CRAP!! COUNTRY RAP!! COUNTRY MUSIC HAS NOW LOST ITS ROOTS!!! Just like Sugarland!!
So she wants to put all “country” stereotypes in a song and call it country. Then people support this because it’s Beyoncé. Get the fuck outta here this will never be country.
sorry....  it's not her
She probably stole this song from someone
The only thing remotely "Country" in this song is the Whoo. Hope her & hubby feeling good about themselves buying this piece of crap into a Billboard hit. What a joke
what a sad way to go....you did not need to degrade yourself like this...your voice is amazing...this video just turned me off YOU
How is she’s able to wear that outfit on YouTube? She’s practically wearing nothing.
What a stupid video…
They are saying Beyonce is the greatest Country artist of all time. Ever.
Boring
Video sucks
It is offical this is now the MOST overplayed song in the world, time to let it die.
Sorry. Country music is defined by the singer/composer's personal story/stories. It's about growing up country, horses, cattle, slammin' screen doors, pickup trucks and country heartbreak. While I respect Beyonce for her career I can't help it if I find "Texas Hold 'Em" and other songs ( with the exception of "Blackbird") a vain attempt to capitalize on cowgirl culture that is so chic right now.    Her outfit, or rather lack of one, in her "Texas..." video is SO disrespectful of country culture. She looks like a dive-bar stripper. Sorry not sorry. I know she grew up in Houston but the fact she had to be photoshopped onto a horse, wearing an outfit traditionally reserved for young ladies who have won rodeo competitions, shows, even moreso, what she doesn't know about country culture. Most of the music on this album has no heart.
This shit ain't real country
This is actually a terrible song.
That’s horrible
The song is funny.
Great marketing, SCAM. Got me to listen to Beyonce for the first time ever.   But I only listened to it to see if it truly was country. My conclusion is that it's DEFINITELY not. And I love how everyone is saying blacks started country music. No, they definitely didn't. They are part of country music's roots, but they aren't the creators of it. People need to read a freaking book instead of believing a headline. Fast forward 50 years, "Didn't you know it was a black man that first stepped foot on the moon?"
complete BS! you are no Mickey Guyton, so stop! this is NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!
They hate us but love our culture 😂
I dont think this is really country music. I dont really listen to country, but this just sounds like she threw some random phrases together that sounded "country"
Really? This is shit
More folk music
Stupid I'm done
Not a fan
Johnny Cash, WIllie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Rogers, Dolly parton, John Denver, Charlie Daniels, The Highwayman, etc. Go and listen to those instead, the real music...
STAY IN YOUR LANE "LADY!"  THIS AIN'T YOUR GENRE. YOU F'KED IT UP.
As a Texan this is a desperate attempt to be part of the country music world. She’s from Houston like me and I am embarrassed for her. Put some clothes on
🤮
This isn't country.
This alblum IS NOT country music. This may be her "version" of it, but that doesn't mean its country music.
I’ll stick with 80s country it don’t have have naked people singing in it

Wish I was lucky enough to get famous off other people writing lyrics for me. What a hack. The next Mgk here
Cultural appropriation. It’s a genre associated with white people and made famous by them. So yes it’s cultural appropriation. Same way you say Eminem commits it
Never thought I'd be defending country music. This ain't country music
No thanks! This is terrible…don’t appreciate the partial nudity and language either.
Like the song but too much swears
beyoncé just so you know, I hate hate hate this song
There is a John Mayer song that has this same vibe, I swear.
She really nailed song
Wow what a way to bring sleaze to country music. Put some damn clothes on.
This is thrash.
IS THIS IT? Oh wait, no that's The Strokes
Who did her boobs🤔
embarrasing 😂
Not country but a pop feel wrong, it is a pop singer out of her element.
Oh my word! Gotta show them boobies.
The good ol' lady! She is a truly Queen!
I thought she was a mother.  Dressing like that is horrible. Children dont like being embarrassed by their parents, its a fact. Psychologists says so all the time. The biggest female singers of the past didnt dress like this to sell their music. Their voices were their talent and they have longevity, by not doing what she is doing here.
I was today when I learned this is Beyonce singing
don't visualize this on rural radio, but will try from now on. real live gun shows a plenty though.
next song she will  came out naked ...🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Why is this the worst “country song” and “country music video I’ve ever seen. It’s painful
baphomet hand gesture
Boring
I swear they just playing the same clip over and over again lol
She is so dirty  no need to wear Like this respect to celen dion
This ain't texas
Tasteless lyrics
Horrible song!
She from Texas what you expect.
Everytime i hear this song i have to think about the engineer from tf2
Lol no wonder it doesnt sell with country people ..this aint country
Why dose she do the same thing
Worst video ever
This is not country
Funny how she is trying to be country 🤣🥱
Terribly
I mean I expected more just cuz of the lyrics. Underwhelmed is an understatement
such a fitting visualizer to go with such a dogshit song
First black woman to ruin country music. I wonder what executive Jay Z pimped Beyoncé out to, to make this bullshit happen. There is nothing country about this song or her. Her being number one only proves she fucked her way to the top and Jay z ain’t the top
The lyrics...😂😂 So dumb
❤🎉🎉😊 2:22
Nice try boo...This sh!t garbage
As someone from texas    This song is trash
This sucks bad
Stay on the R&B side and leave the country for the professionals...sorry
This was a difficult listen :/
This is low key terrible
I’m starting to save up NOW for this tour. I wanna be so close that she sweats on me.
Baphomet fingers over and over again
Really sucks that flaming garbage like this is actually what makes up "popular" music these days.
The only way she was able to sell this shitty song was by being naked. Song sucks so bad and you jave to pay big bucks for people to play it over & over raping our ears. Dont be so creative.
This woman is a JOKE TO COUNTRY MUSIC!!
1,000 dlls for the video production, 20 million for the radio stations to play her song over and over
Dumb song almost seems like she making fun of country
You ain’t country at all
Hey its Franklin coming over to my house 😂
this song is so unfathomably bad man
This shit is 🔥🔥!! Literally it is a pile of shit that is on fire
Where is the Horse 💘❤️🐴🐎
Keep calm and listen Texas Hold'em 😆❤
Beyonce :i have only 7 secs to do this Director: just show your boobs and were done
So after years of complaining about people stealing your culture you come out here and steal my culture make it make sense ma’am
This video has to be a joke
Where’s the rest of her clothes
What is this crap
Country singers don't dress like that
Why is she naked?!?!
I only listen it for this becuse my english teacher (Im hungarian) want us to write a review
This is generic as fuck and is only popular due to her status. If a nobody did this, no one would listen and would ridicule it. Can’t wait for beyonce and lopez to make a song with 15 words and call it art
Shit song, shit album
She makes Texas look hot
Her dress 😶😶
Trash writting and doin the same thing over and over XD , what a joke
Il video non mi piace, è scarso e ripetitivo, bahhhh
I like the part where she does the gun thingy
Very boring video🥴
Weel, everything from this song you can see it in Young Sheldon! Great song.
This sounds like a song picking on country music tbh.
Tell me you buy your viewers and streams without telling me... Everyone hates the song yet it's all over the radio? The music industry is bought not built
If she says it isn't Texas than it is not country
They cant do one video without telling us they are illuminate, the give away on this song is the glasses only let her right eye see which is their main symbol 👁
Dang. That really sucks
So this little harmless tune is what everybody is all up in arms about which in turn is what led me here in the first place pondering: is it the lack of depth of the - shall we say "composition" that people take exception to or the fact that it is voiced by a non white artist or maybe both? Either way - seems like ppl have no real problems these days..
This is trash. Her 15 minutes will be up soon. #NOTCOUNTRY
Why is she repeating the same thing all the time?? It was just 1 min and I paused the song to think about it
This is racist. It's cultural appropriation.
Everyone is too busy arguing about visualisation vs video to realise she has finally reached Michael level ‘vitiligo’ 😂🤠
I’m disgusted
I have 60 seconds on the video i love me some BEYONCE ALL DAY
I feel like she is just throwing arround words
this goes unbeleivably mid
Trying to get support outside the pedo circle lol
To whoever is listening to this song now, wherever you are.... Sending you love, peace, healing and all good wishes. May your life be good
Ok what was that supposed to do?
مي تمسي بيار كرتا هو ياالله
Still a baddie
Hate this! Get off the country bandwagon 😡
Elle es trop bien ❤
I think I walked into the wrong honky tonk
How can this be number one. Am lost
This is porn and the whole album is cultural appropriation.
👎
Class!
Sending hate from Australia.🙏
Disgusting
Wtf lol  over and over same stuff? Boring and annoying
To quote George Takei,  “……OH…… ……MY…….!”
So sexy shooting...❤
For those talking about her “Daddy Lessons” performance with the Dixie Chicks……  TRUST ME, the LAST band you wanna break through into county music with is the Dixie Chicks……. they can’t even hold their own over here anymore…… at least for the past 21 years anyways…… y’all can have them over there on the pop scene  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She doesn't have the small town country charm. She's just a washed out plastic diva with too much money and free time to do what she wants and got bored so she decided to dabble in country. I wouldn't be impressed unless I heard her start yodeling or something.
I actually like the song…… but I certainly don’t wanna see W.A.P. brought to county music…….. keep the nasty shit far away…..   We have morals over here
This sucks.
would have liked to see her tear it up dancing. oh well.
She's so naked... Why have anything on, if it doesn't cover up anything?
This song sucks fat chodes
She already has told y’all that her daddy taught her…
this aint country. like if u agree.
Que hermosa canción me encantó te quiero mucho Beyonce Reina del pop👑👑
Beyonce, I have to admit that I always thought you were overrated in every way possible! I thought you were untalented and undesirable as a musician! I thought you were average-looking! I want to say I am Sorry! This song has changed my mind in every way possible!!!! I can't wait for the next song to come out! I hope you get a country music award next year for it also! Just give the country folk some time to get used to you being a country singer, if they are like me they will Love your music!!!!!!
This is one dumb ass song
No one is talking about the hole in here tights (check the foot area)
Awful....just Awful.  Sorry honey. U ain't country
Worst song of the year. But the year is young. There is still time to top this absolutely awful piece of garbage.
All this talk about female empowerment and they still wear no clothes
Back in my day country music videos weren’t sexualized
Just gross.
I wonder what Hank Sr., Patsy Cline, George Jones, Loretta Lynn would think of this? No doubt, Beyonce is a great artist in pop. This ain't the country music I grew up with!
Hey thanks for the mesage, at first I sad sopriset. Like what is this now . Anderstud the mesage. Miss Blue for me. 💙
Love you
Man, almighty, they call this talent. I’ve lost complete faith in the country music world if they consider the special. I’ve never see anything this pathetic.
Love the song video's stupid
Sucks
Hank is like “wtf”
boring
What a BAAAAADDDDD song.   And i mean TERRIBLE !!
lol I wonder if she wore this outfit to one of the diddy freaky sex parties she and dear old hubby went to over the years...
Trump makes everybody white😂😂😂
I have s*** out better country after eating at a French restaurant. The only reason why people say oh I like country now is because they're just trying to support Beyonce. This is not good music. Real country tells a story and has good instrumentals and rhythm. This is repetitive beats and crap only made so she can corner a bigger fan market.
Everybody goes country. No more hiphop or r&b?
True all Cowboys and Country boys drive a Lexus and throw their car keys up 😂
Im here for her Boobs 😂
Your such a poser wanna be!!! Stick with what your great at. R&b and pop
STUPIDEST SONG THEY FUCKING MADE SO FUCKING ANNOYING DUMB ASS SONG I HATE IT I WISH IT WAS NEVER MADE
🤢🤢🤢🤢
Yes, she sucks she needs to stick to R&B.
Trash
Prime example of " murder down on music row". People just aren't satisfied until they fuck everything up. She needs to stick to her crappy shit and leave country music alone.
If THAT is country................then that means Cradle of Filth has always been singing Christian gospel music!! And country folk don't dress like LA hookers.
This is not a good song.
pig
Thats not a country song is G arbage
Why does everything have to be so fucking sexual?
Boy, they sure worked hard on the choreography 🙄
i need a video of this song :(
Overplayed.
Damn
She would be my last choice for looking of an country singer, So what the heck...
I think she needs to go and spend some time with Savannah Dexter...
I hate it not a country song …
Beyonce: I didn’t have time to put my shirt on this morning  Producer: no problem
Um?
One eye covered with a snake.. here’s another sign if you need one
OudeTrade CEO of ❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a RUBBISH MUSIC VIDEO! WASTED VIEW
This is so bad it hurts.
They’ve ruined everything else so stay away from the country music
Wannabe country ah music bruhhh 🤡💀
Don’t get the vulgarity. Love the song.
I have came here for two large reasons...
I made it 1:07. I couldn't listen any more.
This ain't country or good. Its just trash folk music
WTF!?!?! This is the worst video ever created!!! I mean really! You got the money, make a video! I'd rather see TikTok couples dancing or anything!!!
Like Natalie Imbruglia, I'm 'Torn.'  Torn because the song is catchy and torn because it's Beyonce.
The only reason her “country” song made it to #1 on billboard country is because of her fans, and not actual country listeners
I’m sorry but what was the point of this music video? Please tell me this is not the original.
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has moved back up 9 spots to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100! "Cowboy Carter" has debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200! Keep going! 👑🐝🤠
'Whiteface', 'cultural appropriation' and 'country appropriation' coupled with an Onlyfans bod!
Sounds like garbage
Amooooooo❤❤❤
What a slap in the face to real Country music!
Video sucks more than Beyonce does.  Feck it.
Absolutely revolting!  Little girls are supposed to look up to her as female inspiration? Sure, dress with as few as possible, exploit your sexuality.  Leave Texas and country music alone!  Stick to the genre that has made you millions!
💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
I'm not a country music fan but I have heard some pretty great ones that I've loved. This is definitely NOT one of them. This is music and lyrics on a loop with a video shot by an Android.🤣😂
Madonna  MUSIC 😂😂😂😂😂
She couldn’t win awards with her music so she had to switch to country and mess it up more
Crap
Want about the bru boobe
Stupidiest video ever
Garbage. 👎
This is garbage
I thought she was from New York all this time.
Like this song! Its trendy and different
Garbage
Her glock is hella crooked.
We don’t want this S**t music videos in country!
wow this so bad.
Ne s improvise pas countrygirl qui veut. Une veste échancrée ne fait pas tout
Whos came here coz of unis?
Ai. Really.... wanna be no 1 in country too?? Why? Wtf??
Just another artist chasing profits by pretending to be something they are not. I haven't seen something this phony since Timberlake's "Man of the Woods"
I like the song but the video is not
C'est pas la peine de se mettre à poil
🚮
She has an amazing voice but her voice isn’t country.
The worst song of 2024. And the award goes to BEYONCE🎉
Its ugly😢
wow ! The BRAINWASHING in this video is incredible. AI, violence, guns, hyper sexualized dark feminine energy , subtle dark agendas..wonder why humanity is SO BRAINWASHED ? Great example of MASS MEDIA and ENTERTAINMENT subtly manipulating mass consciousness.  All right here in pop culture, glamourized. the power of influence of the dark agenda, right here on full display.
😂pensei que estava em um loop infinito 😅
Wtf is this she thinks shes sexy js bc of not wearing no clothes-
I would love to see her do some metalcore stuff lol i know that would never happen but could you imagine?
Is this is???  Her music video???
Wtf is this crap😂😂😂
The video is kinda sus 😮🫢
I really, really like it.  A lot
I'm a firm believer the word "boogey" should be forgotten from human memory. That and "hodown"
I believe that cultural exchange is the embodiment of America. A bunch of cultures coming together to create something new. Country music don't belong to any people, it belongs to all people. The human race. That being said ........this song sux.😅 The "I'll b damned can't dance with choo!" Just kills me.😂
What about the black panther shot out?
Hai Beyonce, why don't you toples instead a half naked? 🤮
This is SOOOOOO STUPID!!!  Are we really allowing Beyonce to become a country Artist????  What does she know about being country??? Dumbest song i have heard, honestly she is the furthest thing from understanding country life.
Why isn’t this considered trashy?
Couldn’t be much worse anything for money.
I'm sorry.  This is just awful. And she has gotten so trashy! And this video sucks.
Why ???
She's not even country come on man stay in your lane your r&b singer Nice try tho lol😅😅😅
More black flow doing country please ❤
not surprised that you dress like this
This is an artist. Love this Beyonce.
YOU! TOO! THESE TWO ACCENT HAD ME WHEN I LISTENED IT FIRST TIME! WOO!
Worst song ever made. Ever.
Beyonce is one of the best I've ever seen. She doesn't have to dress like a hooker...
This song is lame.
The most overrated singer of all times ....
Girl PLEASE PUT THIS ON 👕😭
cowgirl riding thru silicone valley …
Showing all that body does nothing
Beyoncé give us a music video please. We need it. You didn’t do anything for Renaissance either.   It will help make the song bigger than it is B! please 🙏
the song is great, but I will never understand why ANY woman ir female artist wants to show their naked bodyparts all the time. MEN dont do that! So why should we??? its a sexist world. And WE have the power to change that!
Dumbest song ever!! 😂
This shit ain’t country
Overrated
نحن القدماء
This was a song for white people 😂 and yall ate it up
Worst song I've heard .. get to know urself sis
30 Million views for Beyonce's cleavage impressive
Garbage "music". Country music is not what it once was.
Welp.  Beyonce need to chat with Billy Ray and Lil Nas, figure out how to getter done.  This is just dumb after the first round.
She’s whiter then Michael Jackson 😂
12
So trash
Beyoncé just riding on the current Western-hype driven by Yellowstone, 1893, 1923 and other TV-Series...First this song is bad, really bad and second don't support this. This has nothing to do with a musicians will to grow and experience, this is only done to make money.
Disdy and Epstein Island is all i think about now when I see her 😂😂😂
The devil is slick too yup.
Next Beyonce will sing Mariachi 😮coming around the corner 😂
Delete that shit
What does stupid video!
Make me wanna go live in texas 😂😂
This is most definitely NOT Country.  As usual Beyonce is almost naked, guess that's the only way she can make money?   Amazing how many men like fat women.
The choreography seems quite complicated. 🫤
Buckle bunny you ain't Country and texass sucks
Sad for this poor girl.
Only this? Wish Jay Z will not complain if it doesnt win album of the year 😂
Awesome. ❤❤❤❤❤
Worst song i ever heard in my life. LMAOOOOOOOOOOO RETIRE
Dit is anouk lievelingsliedje
I like it
She needs to cover up
Your time will come Beyoncé all the horrible things the elites have been doing is coming to light
Terrible
Girl trust that jacket more than i trust my life 💀💀💀
Stay with rap country you are not
Can you stop doing the same move over and over and over again because it's getting kind of annoying and put some clothes on I've never watched you I love the song I Love the song that you make I have never ever seen your songs that I'm going to see them today
When talent is absent, show skin. Gotta be to most overrated person of all time
so trampy!  yuck
Why u do the same thing all over again
Worst song and video I've ever seen. Complete waste of time and money.
Haters gonna hate. So sorry.
wow la cancion se disfruta Tambien con los ojos cerrados jejeje fiu fiu fud fud
“. Dang I forgot to bring my shirt” producer—“ no problem”.
Que fome video
Beyoncé sucks
She basically naked
Worst video ever
Need to be in jail !!
Nice song but:  “Devuélvanos Texas ratatataras 🙃 y la charrería también”.
Wtf has country went to like what happened to George strait or the old possum.
this is a really bad song, bad production too.
Some folks should just stay in their lane. Nothing about this is "Country."
Beyonce isn't a 10. She's an 11
a little disappointed that the video is just her on loop doing one thing. like. u could’ve visualized a tornado or whatever
Country charts can say whatever they want. I have ears, and I think it's just awful, but if you love it then get on with yer badself!
Most boring music video ever 😂 dope lyrics though
Uh...yeah, no.
The people who clicked on this just for the video 😂
We love it DuD
to the guys saying this is a visualizer, the fuck it isnt, this is a goddamn youtube short on repeat
Shittest video i ever saw...
The song is catchy.  Not sure if it is country but it is catchy.  The video however seems lazy AF.
nice try.
If I won the lottery I would pay youtube to ban this song
I think is great to see Beyonces chest over and over again❤
i started hating this song bc how overplayed it is.. wanted to see if the video would relight the spark but now im more mad LMAO
Y yo esperando 🙄 la otra parte del video o viendo la,diferencia cada vez que venía una y otra vez, me aburry y lo vi todo 😅😅, el ritmo 👍 🆗️
Absurdo... Para la trayectoria de Beyoncé esperaba algo espectacular.!  al parecer se quedó sin presupuesto..!! 🤔 Sin duda alguna el video más aburrido que he visto en mi vida no lo volveré a reproducir..!! 🙄🙄
Edit
Is that all she has t/a?
Pff how cheap does she look.
I don’t get it
It’s a visualizer not a music video guys. I swear some of you don’t read 😂
Who does she think she is?
I kind of like this cut.
Terrible attempt
La música llama y la letra bueno pero la escena no creo que sea la real
She’s getting old and that’s her only safest move LOL
Why is she showing her boobs? That is weird!
I thought was Rihanna at the beginning.
Since when do we have "official visualizer" instead of "official music videos".
Ridiculous! Worst shit ive heard in years
I know its been said already but its worth repeating. Its the Franklin theme song! https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=Go3dNkM5GHjlBw8Q
Is this a joke?
This song is calming.
Album’s trash it’s not country just soul R&B no real instrumentals. Garbage
hologram ready ahh music video 😭🙏‼️
Pour moi le clip a éait bâclé
Most annoying song of the decade award
Her Lemonade album must’ve bombed that she had to go make a country album
WTH did I just watch
It’s a cool pop song. It’s definitely not country though.
This is pop music has nothing to do with country music 🗑️ 🤮
trash
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON , DOLLY NEVER SHOWED HER BREASTS, OTHER THEN THROUGH A SWEATER, SO NOT CLASSY , AND PS I LIVE MOTOWN AND CHARLIE PRIDE AND DARIUS RUCKER SO NO ITS NOT A BLACK THING WE ARE ALL ONE PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS NOT COUNTRY 🐷
Love you Beyonce pround of you
I feel like this is white appropriation. bc think about it. white peoples can’t do black peoples culture but when black people take our culture, no one bats an eye. the hypocrisy is absurd & crazy
sucks!!! Pure porn that's all she's got. Both and Rhianna have dumbed down song writing to the lowest level. so sad this even gets airtime.
You know this, but you are a QUEEN, and you're elevating other Queens! What you're doing is so important - thank you, and thank you for the music. Also, #RhiannonGiddens #BrittneySpencer #MickeyGuyton #AmethystKia etc, etc, etc.
Can’t stand this over-indulged woman and her gangster husband! Can’t singers concentrate on their music rather than  their pornographic distraction?   What a world!
Esta mujer canta bien lo que sea 🤷‍♂ This woman sings well whatever
I have never seen Beyoncé dancing this song with the choreography that we see everywhere. Anyone can tell me where I can see Beyoncé dancing and who wrote this choreography
Yuck. Not my cup of tea...nobody would watch it if she had clothes on
Trowing dice
I thought that was Jojo Siwa 💀🤣
Most stupid music video I have ever seen
Why does this lady always over sexualize her videos?? 😮😒🙄
Men of Honor. We are gathered here once again.
She was definitely in her fertile period here
Oh no
Texas should be ashamed of this garbage.
Bad music
Guys count to 12 slowly and say this ain't texas
75 year old give today's music a listen to...... I'll mention if I'm impressed. RUBBISH VIDEO ! OK SONG, NOTHING GREAT.
Oni ty zpěvačky oblékaji, tak ze je neoblekaji 😁
Die gemachten titten 😮....Ekelhaft ,, kann man nicht einfach mit Stolz altern ? Pfui
I would be good with the song...if it were clean...Not good language for children...One reason Taylor is huge a Whole Family can listen to her music..without covering up their ears... Imma stick to my Gospel....AMEN
Uh
Nope
Yo she shot bullets out of her hands 🤣🤣
I hope the creators of Franklin the turtle sue her for this. This is an exact copy of the intro to the show.
I'm here after Unis cover. Elisia & Yunha
Stinky Stripper Joint Music!!!! Too Bad Hurt Feelinfs😂😅😊!!!
Shut i already know this
Those are cool glasses
Wow
I love you so much beyonce❤
What was the point of this video, apart from the artist masturbating their ego?
Stop mentioning texas. We don’t claim you anymore 🙄
❤
❤❤❤
I watched her move the same way for 3 minutes? Uh dahhhhhhhh😅 shiiiiiii I'll watch Nicki not move at all in a music video 😂
Don't hold 'em Texas!Give 'em a break and a shot at the American Dream 🇺🇸.
Not that good, relax guys.
This isn’t country. Its terrible. It took a team of producers and writers to say hey this is a great country song. Well they lied to you and what’s with this awful video. It’s a joke
And why less clothes? This song doesn't make any sense.
Shes disgusting like who does that
What a waste of time.
WTF
What’s the point of this video lmao
too naked, like always
DOES ANYONE FIND THE LYRICS ODD? PERHAPS THINK THE VIDEO IS WEIRD AF!?  NVM. LOL
I wonder how many takes this took lol
Terrible song. It's a terrible video.  Stick to what you know.
This is the 50,000th comment. BOOM !
Love this song
Rather hear warm dog shit hit the hot texas pavement
Wow this song sucks ass

🫡🫡🫡😘😍❤️
It's kind of a country-gospel blend stylistically, isn't it? Gorgeous backup vocals.
So when does she come out with her equivalent of call me by your name?
💖UNIS💖 song cover send me here~~ 🤠🐮🌵
Crap song, crap video. And Beyonce has no nipples.
I’ve seen better.
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸

Terrible. I'll never support another white rapper. This was god awful.
I love her voice, and I don’t understand what it means by this ain’t Texas, but I think it’s real cool
This new music is really good ❤
I'M WONDERING WHY AN AGING ARTIST SUCH AS SHE...WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO GET MOST OF HER TITS OUT...AT THIS STAGE OF HER CAREER... DON'T GET ME WRONG... SHE'S STILL FINE AF!!!!
As a country music fan this shit is a disgrace to the country music industry
Lame video
So this was the whole song, only heard a part of it...  Nice sounds different from usual lol.
As Creative as the Song LMFAO
Look 👀 who the hell wants to win a cmt 🥉 award
It’s embarrassing this is called “country”
Disappointed in the video
What is this mess?😂😂😂
There's better singers than her
She ain’t country
I thought this lady was supposed to be talented
This song is shit
What is she trying to do here?  Not a fan
Lol
Now you stealing from kids songs
Yawn.  Unfortunately, this fits right in to contemporary country music.
3 minutos de mi tiempo perdidos
Honestly I expected better 😅
This is not fucking country
It's awesome we get to see them pretty much naked. Thanks B 😊
Horrible fukn song. Cringeworthy
When you learn to make country music from Queen. You get cheap "Fat Bottomed Girls" and even an old UK band can make country music better than this song. Long live the Queen.
I can't even.... horrible 😞
This is sick... Kids watch videos on YouTube the way she's dressed isn't how any country girl would dress.
Than need to add to 6 gta song 🔥🔥🔥
I love the brain dead ppl that read visual but are still bitching in the comments. Anyway the brain rot ppl can't read past this point. This is dog shit pandering Walmart music lol. Don't know what I expected. At least she sounds self aware that she is doing a rug pull
Why didn't she just do this from the start after destiny's child...🤷🏽‍♀️
Are people stuipd it is not country
Beyoncé can’t do country  worth poo  she should  stay what  made her  famous
The video for this song could have been so much more. What is this trash?
You are ok!  You don’t have respect for her performance so for don’t have respect for that you seen in her performance  so just getting proud about how you feeling like all the other like her of what her is doing.  Hope the little  child did turn out like her not the mom.  Thrust me you aren’t the only one.
And the Grammy 2025 goes to … ❤
😂😂😂 que chido, económico y rápido 😅😅😅
One eyed symbolism. Wtf
Put a dang bra on n cover up
Bruh. Is no one going to point out the Franklin the Turtle theme song mash.
Fake
HOLY😭HOW DID THIS SONG BEAT HALO
disgusting
this song SUCKS
Song is great but the video could of been better.  No offense but has nothing to do with the song.
She ain't no Darius, in the lyrics department, that's for sure...
Sure my 5 year old Niece could do Better 😂
Lied gut , Video Müll.
So sick of this song and the wannabe country artist. Jesus fcccccccck anything for some sort of inclusion. 😂
Her voice lends really nicely to the country genre. Bravo! ❤
She has the talent to sing and can definitely dance. Is it really necessary to make a music video with so much of an outfit?   Yan, I know it's part of the song, but she becomes like JLo, whose marketing strategy is to show up almost every part of her body.
I guess the cheapest production ever just have her walk and pew pew
I live in marfaaaaa
Can you make another pageant song
I'm not going to lie that sounds like shit..
Hello look therer 💃🏼🕺🏼
😊😊👍👍👍
Stupid Video
Givin me nausea with all the repetition.. who else 😂??
Boob tape workin some magic here 🎉
I love the song but hate the video
This is a straight insult to country music 🤮
😊 I love beyonce
What’s with her outfit???  😩Do you have to be 1/2 naked all the time??
This is just repeating the same clip over and over again! WHYYYYYYY
Hank didn't do it this way
Whats crazy is the video is worse than the song.
At this point she's just trolling people and you're just buying into it.
Come on beyonce you are married ... Little respect to your husband and wear something
This looks p*rn... What is beyonce doing ? Onlyfans ???
Hate from planet earth ❤❤❤
That's it?  😂
Beyonce sucks and has to show off her body cause she is talentless.
She almost white from all that bleaching
The song 😊 The video💀
Horrible
Black people need to stick to rap.
I cut off she didn’t have any shirt or bra on
What has happened to us as a society that we are no longer offended by videos like this??  I love the song, but all the nudity, sexuality, is not necessary and I can not find how that represens country music at all.  I'm offended and don't see how in the world this video/song became #1!
gross
Trash ngl
Crap
The lyric video was more engaging. All I can think about is how she must be freezing.
Cultural appropriation at its finest
Haha .... not ANYONE can just make music just because their talented
Beyonce sex 🤮🤢
It's sweet melodies to our ears ❤
What is the point of this video?
Stupid 😂😂😂😂😂
Justice for Franklin 🐢
Why do some female artist feel they have to get half naked to do a video, if the music is good. That's all you need.  This just looks trashy to me.
i am on the phone sje is sining
Dumbest shit I've seen all month, and I love titties 😅
Instead of wearing clothes like that, it's better not to wear clothes at all 😂
This is the same Beyonce, over and over and over and over, repeats over and over, like Whip It by Smith.  UGH lame.   Beyonce will never be Country.   Not in her soul.
I ❤love texts and it quite catchy ❤ form charlize x
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxuTnG6cndKqZbdasOZ6w6XkqTCq70jXtZ?si=C8KtEWkFihG8UbVX
Beyonce brings the Ghet - Ho to country. Hard pass.....
This has to be hands down the worst, most uncomfortable and out of place visualizer for such a catchy song that i have ever seen.
All other aspects aside, this song has the lyrical genius of a 3 yr old who just figured out what rhyming is. How could anyone listen to this and not be embarrassed for the human race.
That back beat took me out 🔥🔥🔥
If you want the community to respect you maybe you should respect the community. This is so inappropriate for country and the traditional mindset.
And she has a daughter???
Hey here comes  Franklin .. ok thank me later
I love the song and keep hearing it everywhere, look it up and . . . . Ummmm is this truly her video? I can't even watch all the way through ha ha ha so stupid. I will enjoy the song, but never wasting time on this again ha ha ha
sarà assurdo ma per me questa non è la Beyonce di Halo...totalmente cambiata in tutto!!!!!!!!!
She definitely a part of the Diddy and jay z trafficking 🤢
She's not white this isn't country!!!
Who is in 2024
Trashiest song in the USA
That’s the theme song to Franklin 😂😂😂
lazyest video of all times
I think they've done this video on purpose, those satanic groups, look at the eye
the fact that this is considered country music even by a few people is an insult to every single country artist ever to live
I wonder wat artist she took this song from 😂 now who wrote this B
Love you ❤❤❤
I think she spent more on Single Ladies. The lyric videos and fan videos are better than this and that's disappointing considering how much money she probably had in the budget  for this album.
🤮 please just go into retirement
Beautiful ❤🎉
She has a demon in her
this song sucks, wtf, how do people listen to this
Good job
She is such a sl.
Can't stop listening 🎧🎧🎧
i love the confidence  that she has <3
Lazy lyrics hell yeah
❤❤❤❤ I from Texas 🤠
Well that was pathetic lol
Really?!?! Stupid song and video!
Podľa mňa by mali všetky celebrity chodiť stále nahé bez výnimky 😛
this is trash
This is descusting
28m in a month,lol Once you go woke it's time to go broke,bye bye.
As a Texan I can prove this song is so true about Texas we have tornados every week in April
You'll never be country 😂😂
Its shit
I gotta say, I don't hate it but it's not that good.
Wow, this song sucks ass
Could we stopppppppp doing covers😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is trash 😂😂😂😂
Qué producción! Se rompieron el lomo con el video, eh? Los mismos 17 segundos repitiéndose a lo largo de 4 minutos. Andáaaaaaa...!!!
Ain't no way them titties sitting that pretty at her age.
Just come out naked already... FGS Beyonce
My young daughter loves fashion design, and I make songs to help her with this.❤
Looks like AI created
this song is so bad holy moly
This is stupid
They total CGI’d her nips out
Uhhhh anybody else think that she should cover up more
2:28 how are you shooting
Why has she got all out 😂 no class
What a boring video
She white wishing
BEYONCÉ WORSHIPS THE DEVIL OPEN YOUR FKN EYES YALL
No morals at all.
Glad she doesn't sing Mexican music. LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🧞‍♀️please I’m subscribed
BEYONCÉ WORSHIPS BAPHOMET IF YOU CANT SEE YOU ARE BLIND

My bf  likes this songs
Maximum 100$ videoklip. Katastropha.
This video is highly inappropriate.  Its not county. She is a hip hop singer. She shoild stick with what she knows. She is half naked . Disgraceful to country music
Oh please put some clothes on ...puts people of the music .
What the hell is this crap?
worst 3 minutes and 57 seconds of my life
@asmodeus72 you're loss
Idk
This is it ?! At this rate she can sing  the ABC's wearing a tutu , and people would love it . 😂
UNIS kpop Group brought me here. LSS
Garbage
John 3:16  For God so loved the world he gave his one and only son so that whoever believe in him will not perish but receive eternal life.❤  Jesus love you all ,believe in Jesus and be saved.
wonder why she bothered to wear any clothes
And why are you doing the same thing. No cause it’s edit
Why you have no bra
Beyoncé
I LOVE YOU BEYONCÉ
Did beyonce just make a country song?! hahahah i can't stop laughing ...howdy doo yippy kai yay cowboy hahah
Horrible. Go back to pop.
ain't Texas this either!
Why has she done this?? Country music is shit and she is so much above all that...very disappointing.
From Spirit Cooking to this........🤌
Eeeek..! I have nothing more to add...🙄😏
Girl where is your budget? Cause there was NONE! 😅
Yes Beyonce - congratulations… you have boobs…. #insecure
Men shouldn't sexualize women  Married women half naked for attention and views and a few million  dollars 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Vile
This shit ass
SUCKS
Cool…. Garbage on repeat. Neat. Shit that’s a country song too.
garbage in its purest form lmaoo
Beyonce , this song is a fit for you ❤. I would love to see a music video with you in a fitted white T-shirt tucked in, blue jeans, sneakers, & a 🤠 hat, big belt buckle, the husband, the kids, Solange & her family, Mrs. Tina Knowles and any other extended family at a family BBQ with Mr. Jay-Z cooking on the grill..... & this song on the radio.... Everybody start doing the TikTok line dance to this song... But you have to pull Mrs. Tina Knowles & Mr. Jay-Z by the hand to get them to dance ☺️ and Ms. Blue Ivy & the twins pull Mrs. Solange out on the dance floor.... That's the image that I see for this music video  ANDDDDD Megan the Stallion & Chloe, Hailey, DDG and the baby in the video would be a nice add on
Its a visualizer
https://youtube.com/shorts/KQ-5PBV1plo?si=-tKU2OWV34_Vepnk
I'm here again because of #YUNSIA
Looks boring sounds boring too
Her song:- Amazing, beautiful, awesome, cool and nice.👍  Her custome:- 🙂💔👻👽💀☠️
on  a loop ? that's what i hear on this video performance , lyrics are tight though like the vibe
Don’t cross the lines Beyoncé just stick to your old style
How do you know Texas ?? 😂😂😂
Hot not that shit don’t fly in Texas
This song is almost as bad as how rigged the superbowl was…..
I used to be a fan of her but now as time goes on it's like she's let her talent waste away or something
Why is she naked? Especially she's not dancing or dressed or has anything providing evidence of what she's singing about
This video sucks 😂😂😂🤮🤮🤮🤮
Worst fuckin "country" song ever. WE DONT RECOGNIZE OR WANT HER I OUR GENRE
I honestly am sick of this song
TikTok has better dance on this song than the actual video
The song ❤ The video 😐
Yuuuhhhh🎉
This aint texas
hoping beyonce will collab and support 16yrs old girls . https://youtu.be/J9xrO2eSICI?si=HxjDoxUOkeRST7m8
Unis cover on this song is amazing. https://youtu.be/J9xrO2eSICI?si=HxjDoxUOkeRST7m8
https://youtu.be/J9xrO2eSICI?si=HxjDoxUOkeRST7m8
gay
Dumb.  A waste of my time. My apologies future self for wasting your time.
This porno sucks
Pretty terrible song. But also not remotely a country song.
🤘👁️
Doesn’t sound even close to country music!???
God awful.
Gross. But i read in between the lines of this song and why she is doing the same thing over and over again. Gross. Hope the entertainment system burns in hell.
put a shirt on
OMG is hot in here 🔥🔥🔥
My favorite.❤
why you always gotta dress like a ho, let it be about the music.
🔫🤠🐎👢 🪢 yee'hea
-you would think with all that talent she would be able to afford some clothes.
Hate from Texas
As above so below all I see 😮
Why does a beautiful woman have to dress like this 😢
Exactly
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
BOREDDDD EVER !!!!! 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
One slip and it’s gone
Beyonce doing a country album is the most predictable, outdated, bland trend she could have hoped on and bet she wins awards for it. Also, Lorde did the cheap single outfit video with a black background first, and someone probably before her. She's such a talent; Why can't Beyonce do anything original or fresh anymore?
I listened to the whole album and I have to say it was the worse music I've ever listened to, it sounded more like R&B then country.
I don't think I want Beyonce influence in country music. Her clothing style and 1/2 pop, doesn't sound country, and cursing? No. I watched the whole video and it's making fun of country music, not being a serious singer of it. Just my opinion.
Sussy Baka
This song is a disgrace to country and ranchers like me
please never make country music again🔥🔥
This song is hot garbaggio
this is not country
Awful! but that’s just my opinion.
I like this !!
I hate this song beyonce, you've done a very bad job.
A girl😮❤❤❤❤
Le titre sympa par contre le clip complètement pourri dommage
Stop appropriating our culture
I love it bring a bit of life into boring country  cleans it up a bit😂
Why is she half naked?? Real country woman don't do that
Zero class and dignity.
Que asco de video.. Nada que ver con su canción... Pero es beyoncé, seguro ganara premios por eso
🤘🌞
Broring😂
Love it ❤
Country artists wear clothes.
I hate this song
Worst “ country song,” ever
Elle claque trop bien cette chanson !!! 😊👏
Dung Heap 😆 🤣 🤡 🤡 clowns.
GOES HARD ON MUTE 🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🥵🥵🥶🥶🐐🐐💯💯
Worst song I've ever heard. Country takes real emotion something Beyonce can't give.
I'm not understanding -- can someone explain this to me -- is there a meaning behind the video being on a loop?
Saturday April 6 2024  Love this song  At Irvine High School at track and field The people that were nice to us : Thank Sister Sarah for Help🎉
Geez can’t stand her!!!! She’s fucked up Country now
🤘🔥
Llewellyn Mitchell will always remember you
I just hope they use this song on the new season of 911: Lone Star ♥️
Y all this is a visualizer, not the music video.
Delete this
we asked for the visuals, she said THIS IS ALL YA’LL GETTING 🤣
Crappy song 🙈
TIL visualizer
She really doesn’t need topless to sell this song
Cannot stand this song
I really like song. This video is pretty disappointing though, with it repeating. There's no story
Rubbish
No no no......please go away !......you are not country, and this is embarrassing!.....you weren't very good at pop music and you certainly ain't  country!
Queen TEXAS No CAP!
so she looks like she's in a revised version. of the best little whorehouse in Texas
Garbage
She needs to stay far away from this genre, it's not working in my opinion. Country music is known for its modesty, why can't we keep it this way?
This is nothing but Horse Ish polluting NYC airwaves. The current state of FM music is pathetic.
Who did it better, Darius Rucker / Beyonce...   Let's not pretend, definitely not Beyonce and her Pop "country"
This is not country..... This is a joke right? 🤣🤣🤣....you can't be serious?
That was most up
Si me gustó el sonido !!
This is a disaster!!
Symbolize will be their down fall. She’s straight up throwing satanic signs in your faces
Ela saiu do Texas mas o Texas não saiu dela
Shit song
Hi Beyonce my mama is a fan of you
Good song 'boring clip sorry 😮
GTA6 better have these jiggle physics
I love this song. Yee Haw. 🤠 🐴 🐎 🎠 🏇 🏜 🌵 🍾🥂🍻🍺🍷🥃
Cultural appropriation anyone? Boo, this fuckin stinks.
When you try to make money from every style of music you can without actually liking the music you’re making. Very generic.
If i am still young，i wish that my future wife still like you when you are over 60 years old. HALO, superstar.
Texas hold ‘em because Beyoncé and jayz gotta be playin poker for the rest of their pathetic rapist lives
Guys it’s a visual not a music video
Somone wish to look she in a normal video, but in my poor opinion I prefere to listening her way to sing a song like that, where the result for a moder music singer, is leterally amazing. A true singer talent consist in the capable to sing difference music styles in a credible way. In the right way and Beyoncè with this "old" country song, has succeeded to convince me at the 100% about her talent.
what I'm watching? some cheap YT porn?
No. Just nooo 👀
Miss.havey eww😡😡
Cheap does as cheap is.
The song is great, the video is lame. That's it, I said it. Come at me, Beetches
She ain't got a t shirt
What is happening? Ran out of idea?
🤘🕯️
If she has so much talent why does she need to perform half naked? #shameful
Most great country singers GET DRESSED before doing the video! You must be insecure to think you have to show your boobs to sell your music!
Amazing
Every one hating on Beyonce need to go outside and touch grass
Nasty and vulgar, not sure why the language and exposed parts are necessary.
This song is a warning!💯 Listen😁
Wow, this is some hot garbage  🔥🗑🔥
I love this sond but  do otter  Clotes  okey
I wanna see other country artists show the goods like beyonce
always flying out west
video con piu' filtri dei miei capelli
This sucks
travis scott and beyoncé got the same producer
Jesus Christ is returning soon. These "idols" work for Lucifer and are distracting the masses of sheep! Wake up! Yeshua forgive them for they not know what they do. ✝️
Pig
Why this woman have to expose her body to prove her talent????? !!!! ????
Song sucks
Beyonce: THIS AINT TEX- 🗣️   Me: 🔇
Er what? Video fail. A better video might have had 100 mill views for star of her magnitude.
Why is she so fat lol 😂
Youtube : don't say gross words, but almost naked girls it's ok for all public
So many people not knowing what a visualizer is💀
Боже...какая х*йня простигосподи )) А все "критики" опять ссут капятком вещая о том, какая Бейонсе талантливая 🤣
Sad, they are playing this not country song on country streams. It's a mediocre song with a very bad video. Insult to the country genres.
I would have expected more than that. Nothing country about that video. Leave country to the people that know country. Love ya but you're not there yet.😊
The absolute lack of awareness in these comments is wild. she's saying as above so below, snake eye,  Baphomet stance, black/white contrast. the whole damn thing is symbolism. Kat Williams was not joking.
Where p diddy
This sucks
She should make anew picture that is not good one
Фигура Бейонсе и эта музыка  делают свое дело
Crap song! 😝
I hope they ban this song it's ass.
Why does she have to appear half naked? This is not country values if she wants to be a country star
This is a great Song!❤🎉
This is not anything country, i live on a farm and this isn’t at all!!!!💀
This is not anything country, i live on a farm and this isn’t at all!!!!
This is not anything country, i live on a farm and this isn’t at all!!!!
Remember when country music used to be good i miss those times
Song I hot trash
INAPPROPRIATE  CRINGE
Genius
Jay-Z about to be named in the Puff Daddy lawsuit😂
Diddy
Dumbest video ever
WTF IS THAT SHE IS HAF NAKED😢😢😢😢 MY EYEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
❣️
This ain't breakfast
They knew exactly what they were doing with her.In this shit, this is pure evil, if you know you know
I like the song but I don't like the clothes
Shameless cultural appropriation
I want a vídeo clip. 😢
Song is trash.
burlesque...so sad what our society has become
It even says offical visualizer not music video
I don't like the video, bit love country music
Never Will be COUNTRY!!!!!! Even if you put some country sayings in a song doesnt make it country or a country person!
É sério que o clipe é só isso?😂😂 Poxa Bey.
I love this song so much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊❤😊❤😊😊❤
Nice body
Budget and teasing
this is not f***ing country song i live in the country this song sucks
Annoying over and over again....Cool once but not a hundred times. Is there a different vid of this? What am I missing? Good song though  😁
Keep shank out of country!
She took Franklin's theme song 😂
I'd do anything to dance with you again, you know who you are..
This is not country.
Crap clip but like the song.
Great song although video needs more creativity
This is so not Beyoncé music at all she would never make anything like this jay z is keeping her drugged up
🤘💡
This is the worst trash I've ever seen and I've seen some dogshit
This isn’t country
No 1 cares about you elitist.  Yall going down!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Shitty song 💩
Beyonce❤❤❤
Love❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Actually the ghetto kids bought me here ❤
shame!
La chanson est bien mais le clip pas terrible, un peu redondant
What's the yeehaw agenda? Tf am I listening too ? You made a bunch of black artist who have 0 interest in country music start making weird country pop mixed songs ? Tf is our government up to.
Big whoop shiwing her chest barely
No se comieron mucho la cabeza con el vídeo clip
Definitely not a country song.
Some cultural appropriation going on here.
Also..this video is stupid
Horrible...go back to your normal music..you aren't country
It’s not a country song because she says texas a bunch of times, it’s more like reversed cultural appropriation…
Very simple. Now start writing rock people
She is I infiltrating country music to destroy it from within...Satan orders.
FAIL ….L’S L’S L’S 🫵👎🏿
Come to Rotterdam in The Netherlands. It's really good amazing music. Have a Nice day. Enjoy the sun.
Who came here after watching unis cover😂❤ I love the song though. Hoping Beyonce will allow them to do full cover.
As a Texan, why do you have to do this to us
What a boring video for a great song
Wow a illuminati song right in our face
Any one Remer halsey you should be sad
This kept repeating and i was disappointed
This song is shit 💩
I hated country till I heard this bullshit. I started listening to real country like Sam hunt and Morgan wallen lol bit of LB and FLG🔥🔥
La chanson est très bien.👍🏻❤️ Mais pourquoi ne s'habille t elle pas?🤔
This is not contry
J'ai entendu le (bon) son de la "B" à la radio, je n'avais pas l'image, W.A.F.,  quelle belle créature en plus d'être une des plus grandes chanteuses actuelles (il y en a peu d'aussi talentueuses...)!
This song is straight ass and is NOT country
She is almost naked. What a shameless woman!
buy why?
Not country just more sucky pop music
We coming for country to reclaim what is rightfully ours✊🏽
GROSS!
<----- My Music
Pulled a Lana Del Rey…. Nice
why does she look white
Not counrty. Bo burnhams counrty somg sounds similar.
I'm here because of UNIS
QUEEN OF ALL MUSIC, BEYONCE ❤❤❤
It sounds good
I expected more dancing then seeing her doing the same move over and over 😞
Isn't the covered eye a symbol of Horus and the Illuminati?
Saw the #unis cover of this song, i didn't know country music was good!
Dang, the opening to this sounds so much like the opening to Golden Coast by Billy Shaddox / Billy Midnight that was released like 17 years ago. Did he help write this?
Are you frickin’ kiddin’ me??! Wth is with the stupid “replay”?? I’m waitin’ for some serious dance moves here. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
Country music is original black people music we made that white people took advantage of
This about the lamest music video over ever seen, cool song though
I like the song until I saw the video
A genuine countrymen song. I strike t reflect the country genre. Clear use of guitar and country music instruments. The style is authentic but with a mild twist. Love it. Excellent work….👍🏾👍🏾😀😀😀
Nice song, love it, but the video, you could spend more than the instagram loop filter viedo to do it
I eat sunscreen
Fake as fuck
I can't get over how horrible this video is. Couldn't they think of anything else? I mean it's just awful.
UNIS brought me here! 💙
Did they forget the rest of the video? Song ain't bad at all.....but damn.
Awesome song - senseless video crappy actually
This is the biggest pice of shit I've ever heard
What are those clothes? Any jeans and tshirt wouldn’t be nicer? The song is very nice reminds me of Shania Twain.
Boring song good video sucks sorry don’t mean bad videos  Mississippi girl cozy in 😮in Alaska
she has no shirt under neath her jacket
Dog put on some clothes there flippin kids on here
It’s actually not a bad song I like her country aesthetic more than the music though
Can someone drop the link for the real video. Thanks
0:12
🤠🐎⛈️
I think country girls that sing have more clothes on.
YOUR ARE NOT A COUNTRY SINGER  YOUR ARE NOT A COUNTRY SINGER  YOUR ARE NOT A COUNTRY SINGER  YOUR ARE NOT A COUNTRY SINGER  YOUR ARE NOT A COUNTRY SINGER
Culture vulture
Omg! There is so much you could have done! This is just lazy. The opportunities are boundless.  Instead we got an Infomercial on panty hose.  Such a let down.
Umm why bother make this video
Great song.  Lamest video ever.  Imo
Como que uma música bosta dessas faz sucesso, não é possível isso, povo tá surdo…..
UNIS’ Elisia and Yunha brought me here!
this was just in poor taste.
Miley
Trash
I think it was a ok song, not a big fan , but she is very talented in her own game, and has pretty voice, but damn if you going to represent country, please put a decent shirt...
Ur are not even real country ur better pop
I hate this song
Seen better christian remix. Sorry
Trash
She's from texas hey and then down down down down😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Put some cloths on wtf
This is AWFUL 😞
shit sounds like aids
& newsflash working: 🍆💦, doesn’t count as working hard. 😂
Pause video. Haven’t listened to this song because I’m from North Dakota where ‘Country’ isn’t something you can just hop over to when your pop star career ain’t paying the bills. Country is a lifestyle & it’s a damn hard working lifestyle. Beyoncé ain’t worked a hard day IN HER LIFE. 🖕 this 👯‍♀️. She just out there trying to jump on any industry 🍆 she can to make a paycheck.
flope
This sucks as much as I thought it would but then I can't stand country music except for Home Free. I like Home Free.
nothing like using a good line dance to exploit skin,  Keep country the way it is; you can't change it into a burlesque show.
Uh oh nip slip
She's got an amazing voice but not for country music
HORRIBLE MUSIC!  What the f happened?!  Her old stuff was real. This is straight crap. Don't give the country bumpkins this to put on in their bars and clubs or trucks.  Be true to yourself Beyonce. It's ok not to give in.
I must have listened to something different than everyone else.
One eye,  devil
This ain't fucking country this is some gay ass shit
Does Beyonce not make music videos anymore?
Possibly the dumbest lyrics ever recorded
She had to pose nude to be accept in texus even tho she is a billioner have value for your self.  I feel sick of hearing this song on radio stay in Newyork is better for you.
Lol
ass
Are you freaking kidding me nobody in country music dresses with their titties hanging out and it's nothing but a slow rap song
What am I Looking at?  Nah ..  not beyonce being cheap
What is she saying? It’s not relatable to the clip or I call it reel. But I can here last word shot
She is going to get beat by taylor swift anyway so she didnt give a damn about this music video
People in the comments don't know what a visualizer is apparently.
THIS IS FIRE ON MUTE
You're not country B... what's wrong with you
Is me or it looks fake asf 🤔
🙌🙌💎💎💎🌸🌸🌸🩷🩷💎💎💎💎
Put some clothes on
BOYS DONT LOOK😂
Not my favourite song
Our kids can’t watch or enjoy anything nomore trying pervert every music their is
i don’t know why this is recommended to me i avoid it for 6 days
This is a prime example of someone trying to jump on the bandwagon. Country is becoming popular again and she is trying to get a slice of the pie. She should prolly just fuck off with this bullshit.
actually the worst song ever
Just coming from a MJ Marathon with most iconic music videos ever produced. WTF is this B?
LAME
Kinda makes me think you're a poser
What is the point of having a video?
What a poor video and such a beauty dressed like a porn star . Why ? great videos of this tune that  the general Public have uploaded on you tube tho ! .
This songs sucks 🤢
Creepy
Its soulless and empty sounding.
jZ is such a lucky guy
Mid
???
Can someone explain to me why Beyonce looks like she's in a select your character room in the thumbnail. 😂
😬😑🔫 me everytime when I hear this song 😑😩
Tanner addell does ALL of this better
J'aime beaucoup ❤ Bien
J'aime ❤ beaucoup et   Bien ❤
Love this song ❤ I like this new style
Such an awesome looped video😂 As much as I like what i see its still funny it looks like their on a budget
Pass
Lame song and it ain't country
This is purely intense cringe
🤘🔴 QUEEN OF ALL QUEENS BEYONCE
I love Beyoncé but I don’t like any songs on this album.. the videos were even worse 😢
0:42 I love this song.My mum talk to me
Nobody cares her body is a "little" too exposed?
It's like if you asked AI to write a country song
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
ghetto af
This shyt weak let’s b real now….
I am trying to enjoy the rather cool and unusual song, but I seem to be having a hard time doing that.  Was this really necessary?
This song SUCKS!  Hip Hop Country don’t cut!🐂🐂💩💩❗️
0% Talent 🔥 0% Texas 🔥 1% Nip Slip 🔥 99% STRAIGHT ASS🔥🔛🔝🔛🔝🔛🔝
This is trash
Not much for creativity through this video.
Seems like the jacket or her breast is edited somehow. Might even be AI Beyonce. Not sure but seems unnatural lol
This is a gorgeous song. I hope Beyonce stays with this genre for longer than one album.
This is not Country anymore but pop music. that is why Country Music has been dead for years. they are not two-stepping anymore and putting a banjo in the mix does not constitute country. Country music like Conway, Merle, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynett, and Charlie Pride actually sung about something while Beyonce is putting the nail in the coffin on modern "Country Music" Standards.
Is this a comedy song? What a JOKE.
Pure garbage.
Catchy toon Beyonce good job friend!!
I wonder who they had to kill to get this song.
who else was locked in on the biggily jiggily
Stupid video but loving the song.
I know you're linked with the devil and have killed people with your witchcraft. You need to repent and pray, god is coming back..SOONER THAN YOU THINK, and he's taking his children, only his. Get right with god while you can, you're running out of time.
Yes beyonsé
This shyt ass
This is SO SO TERRIBLE in many ways - you dont belong in our country scene - HORRIBLE
Somebody, call the Lazy Town Police Department!
Leviticus 19:29 also hold down or whoredown, what wages of sin is death repent the Kingdom of heaven is at hand🎉😢
How gonna drop a fucking country song when you do rap that’s messed up bro
Alright :37 seconds was enough, it’s horrible
What a slap in the face to us independent country artist #Creeksquad #RHEC
Your only used two clips 😭
Now this is pretty good but her version of Jolene not so much.
who's here after UNIS' Elisia and Yunha covered this song
N c n c c hbcsnvbx n s n
White people never done anything,  ain't anything i guess huh
She want to everybody see how her breast is beautiful EVEN  if it is silicone prosthesis
Oh lord now😮she going after white country please 😂😂what next a puerto rican song😂😂😂
Hi jay how can we take heat off us yes let's do a country song 😅
boub
This was to boring doing the same thing over and over again the whole entire video.
Texas Hold 'em, but the audience at Beyoncé's concert roasts Drake
If this is country hip hop it's a very crappy way of showing it and I've heard better than this
This may be the worst song ever made
This is not real country and anyone who disagrees has never listened to 70s country.
0:08 is the best part
Beonce
Why am I nodding and gulping my drink with hand in the air in my office?
Whew this ish was cringe
Lord she’s trying to ruin country now 🤦🏻‍♂️
You ain’t no country singer no matter how you try
Sad that they wont show me the amount of dislikes on this trash, soulless, cash grab of a song. Its terrible.
Coool 💎💎
Idk who needs to hear this. But this ain't country.  Imagine her trying to win the CMA 😆 naw. Leave that for real country folks
Why do Black women feel like they always have to be naked 😂 this shit is getting really corny 😂
Country is not for her. This song sucks hard. Country has a soul that she doesn't.
Such talent gone to Lucifer. Hope she thinks it’s worth it.
I just don’t dig it.
She's really personifying country 🙄
Wtf,where is sunshine
Literal Garbage?
“Benoncè”
very similer arrangment to Brook Frasers ,Something in the water , even the whistling is very simmiler .
Minimal effort in this video
I’m not understanding the song or this video or anything
Don’t be a uh come take it to the flo now 💯
You can't use hiphop beats in sexas 🤣
Plastic Tits and AI....
Edit: I think she is so pretty and has trust in the Vest jacket
I like the song not the outfit though
Truth is I was expecting more and no not a C&W fan, video cheap
I get mad Lady Gaga vibes with her whole outfit and I LOVE IT!
She is nasty looking.
AAliyah was so Beautiful no1 compares to not even you Beyonce.. Yip I said it
Oh wow, this song fucking sucks.
Doesn't that outfit scream country. Yee haw
Boring song and sh**ty lyrcs
Love you Beyonce 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Horrible song! I tried to Ike it but can’t stand it!
Rhiannon Giddens
I LEFT ~  THEY HAD LOTS OF SEX FARMS THAT WHY SHE LIGHT SKIN ! SAD !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit is weak af
Gross 😢
How F/N stupid period
Ur die hard fan from Tanzania 🇹🇿❤❤
A real country woman 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love the harmony.  Good reason to kick some dust up.
What do you call it when beyonce falls on stage....a ho-down!!!  Shes s trashy lady.  Pretty but still a *o
why naked...
This AINT TEYYYXASSSS "Millie Bony Bon Brown"
Teenboys of 13/14 y.o. haven't to repeat this video. Smart done, producer! 😆
Complètement nul..
❤️🌟🌟🌟🌹
Unbelievable talent! If she comes out with a number one heavy metal song I will not be surprised. 😂😂❤❤❤
Interesting "as above so below" baphomet hand symbol.  As well as the classic  left eye covering " eye of providence" or all seeing eye or  which ever it may be. Very conveniently placed.
Well, that was repetitive and boring.
A I D S 💯
Eminem was white came to do rap music,at first blacks weren't receptive of him,but he didnt back off,and upto date he's loved cz he destroyed and changed the rap game,even 50cent knows tgat,now beyonce doing country music white people can't suck it,keep pushind,be the eminem of country music
Isn't it strange that it plays everywhere except country radio stations?
Facking sexy you hold my attention for sure, and I'm an adhd dude. Love the song 🎵 Queen B you did it again  💜 shawn
This shit is 🗑...... Sorry but ummmm..... not
Does she always have to put her junk out there?
Me i will alway like her music maybe some people might not like her but I will alway like her and her music if she is doing something wrong i hope she do better
Trash 🤮
Beyoncé I’m sure you know we all love and support you, but please remove your shoutout to Texas from this linedance 😭 The tourists won’t stop pulling this bs 😭😭
Delete this song
Ummm this isn't Beyonce maybe the clonned version. Not excited for the clip at all
Well let's hope she's got at least some more clothes on when the real video comes out
This the worse song I have ever heard, now it is #1 on th3 Country charts.  America and Country music has truthfully gone to the dogs.  This song could be really cute, no cuss words, and she could wear aome decent clothes it would be great.  This way is awful and a very insult to the country music industry.  She did this to make fun of country music. I hope everyone country music artists will ley her know how stupid and just down right vulgar it is for anyone to watch.  Really stinks Beyonce.  Stinks!!!!!
Gotta trash everything. ☹️
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  THIS AIN’T TEXAS 🤠 🤠 🤠 💀 💀 💀 🐴 🐴 🐴
My kids are watching
It’s a real life Ho down. Put some clothes on girl.
Sigh. I love the song, but really could you put some clothes on? That looks trashy IMO. You don't need to do that.
If Beyoncé was dark skin or had a dark skin complexion she would not be as famous as she is now, Beyoncé has white/light skin privileges 😳
This ain’t country
Sing what you know. Country isn't it! I need some Mickey Guyton.
Being a country woman this video let me down so hard!
This aint country music either.
This video sucks! Walk on repeat the song is good video bad...
Yea ur right this aint texes this trash or the devil we belive in the bible in the bible belt boooooooo
So  more  than 26M views, means we all subscribers are alive?!
help me :/ cringe
Hold ‘’um boob tapes! Way to go❤👌🔥
Imagine trying to fake a country album after Ween perfected it. Sad times. All Hail Boognish
She sucks
Why do you have your boobs out😟
Trash artist! She’s always lifting Women up! See what Men gotta deal with? She’s always dragging Men down, while empower trashy Women!
Compare this to the theme for the cartoon Franklin!
This shit is cancerous
Her Song - Cool and Nice Her Costume - 💀💀💀💀
Don't shoot SHOT GUN

Thank you
Aint nothing country about this song🤦
This doesn't sound like  country music. You could easily put R&B music behind it and change  the whole structure of the song. I'm used to hearing the country voice in anybody that sings country. This isn't it.
"Earned all this money but they'll never take the COUNTRY out me" - Formation   And now she's #1 on the country charts. The foreshadowing...
She got melons
This song sucks!!
Trash trash trash
So she wanted to show off her boob job? Classless
This is trash shit🤮🤡💩🤮
AI
Trashy is trashy, stay outta country music
Wow this is song is boring just like her outfit
Gotta be the worse song/ visual of all time
I barely realized it was her,, I hate this song
What’s with the eye thing? Far from country.. Looks more like porn
Put on clothes,  leave country
This is fucking horrible if it's supposed to be country music
Good song but the video 😂 ridiculous
Even Elvis said.  That they call black country the Blues...and he was making aa point od how they put music in these racial categories. I guess he should.know he was the white ...you know who!
If we can't have Reparations.  We got country!! Lol
I guess she had no choice but to move to country…..since she can’t compete with Taylor Swift.😂😂
Yall have to understand this song is a joke. She was mad she got snubbed this years Grammys. Jay Z said I bet if you make a country song you'll win a Grammy and a CMA next year.
While not the worst crossover I've ever come across, Beyoncé is finished, a busted flush, and has been so since around 2014. When you see a once huge name resorting to this level, you know that they are desperate and well and truly finished. A far cry from the days of Halo etc,
Turning country music 🎵 now to 💩
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
This song deserves its own custom dance! 💃 🤠
Way to go, female/black empowerment indeed 🙄
... die Musik, ist super... die Bilder dazu, verständlich, aber dennoch interpretationswürdig ....!
Going to nasty sex up country music now..... please don't feel butthurt and go after my Chicano music too
This is country gtfo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
as a Texan, this is not only great! It’s incredibly bold and contrasty and spot on country from an awesome woman and artist.
Her boobs look weird and distracting, it’s basically the whole video, not sure this is what I want my daughter to emulate and the song is really meh
That isn't how country dresses or talks.  Vulgar.
I love beyonce
Period girl you literally slayyyyyy🩷💜💜💅🏾💜🩷🥵❤️‍🩹
I am doing that song in my school
Piuu piuu🔫
Keep trying country music I am from Wyoming a real country place yeee ha boys
What the actual fuck? That sounds like trash.
Overrated
I listen to country since 16 . You have to grow up in the country to do it. It doesn’t fit if you wasn’t raised farming are doing a bunch of woodys stuff. Or just riding in a pick up truck star gazing. Love you B but you can’t beat Taylor at her game.
Poop
Who did it better?  Beyonce or BigX?
Where are your clothes young lady? 😠😠😠
Nope
Beyonce Verizon ad on the Beyonce video about the same song that I am listening to
Worst song I’ve ever heard
This video is NUTS!
Why isn't she dancing to this song as so many have?
fuck video
lgkhi`😂`❤`🦄`🌈❤️💖`
What in the world? JZ better be wearing a cowboy hat!
Disappointing video
Yeah
Cultural appropriation doesn't apply.
This girl needs to stay in her Lane what a trash ass song she don't know one thing about country music that's for sure
All their dark will be coming to light very soon.
What does country music got to do with boobs? She is so talented, she does not need to show boobs!
I dont like this outfit, the miusic is quite good
Im so sick of hearing beyonce and this damn song overplay
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
What a shit
This is bs
Definitely not impressed, shows how self absorbed she is!  NOT TEXAN, NOT COUNTRY!
Bey is always nearly half naked in her videos.
This is not country music. This is what I call an attempt of  Hollywood trying to devalue traditional country music and the way of life and values . This is garbage and anyone telling her that she’s good needs to stop lying to her.
guys listen to Geoff Castellucci's version of this song, it's soooo good
https://youtu.be/MegpPkZx80s?si=0avGfV7YQ2Ij6oNs
The songs a 5/10 video very poor choice why not just go to a country bar for a couple hours buy everyone a couple rounds of shots. Shoot some fun video on your iPhone and bam that’s some natural fun footage for a video. Though out of respect get people in the bars permission and give them some payment if that video goes viral
At this point women are just naked in music videos🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️💀
worst song ever i hate beyonce
Get this ratchet shit back to the black music
Embarrassing
It's OK, but it ain't country.
All butts were harmed for the making of this video. (Sean Coombs) The they like to 🎉, n u got to tell them no!!! 👀😂🤣🤦
Cringe
Lol Beyoncé gets more animated after hearing there’s a record to beat 😂.
Ya'll ain't taking country music anywhere with this trash.
So because she’s singing on a country tune, it’s country? Her voice still skins regular… they gave lil nas x a hard time and his voice actually sounded a bit country
❤❤❤❤
When white people rap or are in hip black people say culture appropriation but when Beyonce does country all these racist mf are silent now?😂 no surprise
The fact they play this shit on country radio stations is an insult to country music. This isn’t country, it’s far from it.
great artist,great music,congrats...
I heard that song on the Radio and was like maaan what the hell is that sh... again?
What did I just watch?   I thought my screen was glitching.   What?  Why on repeat?   I get artistic vision blah blah or maybe I don’t because that was an awful video.
DRAC
This song sucks
Seriously, WTF is this stupid shit?
😒😒😒 I don't see what's the big hoopla about
When you realize that TEXAS HOLD'EM is what she calls that jacket.
Yeah… nah.
Beyonce's put a twist on country music by adding a touch of R&B, I like this.❤️🤘
I wish she would have danced instead of just trying to look sexy
Wtf is thisssss!!!! 😅
Song's great, but the video is terrible. She even looks terrible.
Who else waiting for the les twin to scoot across the screen to cover her up
I think most real cowboys will just mute the audio and look at you know what
trash
https://youtu.be/rl0-augsLug?si=ptMO6gEKzABxHVjb
Trash
Nice
What in thee American prostitution is this? 😂😂😂 Featuring Jay-Z & Diddy
Hey baby, do you heard Ludmilla's new song? reacts to Piña Colada, this music is very good, you will love it. 🇧🇷🇨🇴  ⁃ Hola, cariño, has oído la nueva canción de Ludmilla? Reacciona a Piña Colada, esta música es muy buena, te encantará
DRAC
This video, the loop playing as the song goes, reminds me of Jackson Wang 'Champagne Cool'😂
I’ve never found her music that appealing anyway. I mean it’s good, it’s just generic.  It looks and sounds to me like her and her crew have plum run out of ideas. Not surprised. The heroes of RnB have been long extinct anyway.  And one thing is certain. This isn’t Texas. There is only one Texas. And that’s in the state of Texas. We don’t need another. Which I am most grateful for.😎🇺🇸
this is without a doubt the cringiest shit ive ever seen
This is garbage music . Whoever think this is remotely close to something good is possessed by stupidity. You’re welcome
nudity sells i guess, sheesh
Que pensaría el general lee de esto?
I don't get it...sorry.
Amazing
I don't get it
Worst Song Ever! Booooo 👎👎👎
😂😂😂😂😂 this ain't it partner !!! Not everything is for everybody
I'm teaching a tap routine to your song, we love the beat!!!!😅
Il love you music  ❤
She's really over rated, songs low tier at best
This is straight up 💩
Just a bunch of stereotypical country bs to cater to stupid people. Song sucks and so does the video, zero effort.
I am not a hater, she has an incredible incredible incredible voice but everything about this video is absolutely horrible corny confusing not really sexy trying way too hard what's with the freaking glasses but again I'm here for the comments I just wanted to see how this whole transitioning into country because it's 80% of the music industry in terms of profit I wanted to see how it's going I hope this is not the official video. She has one of the most beautiful voices on earth, what the hell is going on with the stuff.
Left eye covered mhm
Fake country
Why does  she have to sexualize everything she does?? Is she that insecure ?  Put on some clothes, and do some real singing.
Mittlerweile nervt das Lied, aber so richtig
This song is horrible
country en musique métal à écouter, France Moselle
Ass
me- i gotta hear it so i can see how bad it actually is
Trash
This sound more like r&b than country. I’m just saying. If she was going for country should have went to a country music engineer.
Pray for her she is very dark and lost
Does she ever country dance in this video?!!!
Is this considered country now? Yikes.. trashy nonsense.
We need to cancel this culture vulture
🤮 🗑️ anyone who thinks this is country needs to go to an ENT. Please get your hearing checked
I find this mocking more than talent, but whatever people keep buying her crap.
🙌✨️💥✨️🙌✨️
BEYONCE, DIDDY DO IT OR DIDYOU?
I just can't believe that Beyonce Knowles actually made a song that I like I absolutely cannot stand her music and she actually did it
The only reason this is accepted as good is because its Beyoncé
Not country music, it's just a catchy pop song like anything else Beyonce does. It's not bad, but you know it ain't country so get over it.
Cultural appropriation 😂
If I had the opportunity to delete one song from the face of the earth, this would be it...
💙💙💙👏👏👏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Great job. I considered myself a Texas transplant. I'm glad you did this. 😅
It's the franklin and Friends theme song 🎉
That's no confidence, she's got static nippels.......
No top 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is actually awful
ez report for tities
🪩
That jacket is disgusting does she know that there is a  younger generation follows her that is border line pornography she should  be ashamed 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈😲
I thought Texas was one of the most Catholic states in the USA? It was wrong
Queen ❤👑🐝
This shit is wake
Very Bad song
Fucking song
C'est trop nul comme chanson
Why so cheap 😅
This song scares country artists. It’s too easy for her and they can’t stand it.
gratuitous nudity, wasn't necessary
Was she “cancelled” by the R&B pop industry so she now trying to ruin country? I thought the song was bad but this video is even worse!
Her wearing the pantyhos backwards get me.
Always know when a person don’t have a good singing voice is when they are almost naked to make up. For it
Is she a strip dancer of some sort .? Beautiful woman but not much talent
Wtf is this, its repeating the same shit, this not country, i dont care how much the top 100 country has been paid to put her at the top, this is ridiculous
This song must be eradicated
That song is very catchy.

Nose matado con el vídeo
Saddle up girl❤😁
God damn
曲もビヨンセも大好きだけど歌詞が気になる衣装過ぎないか
I can't even name a Beyonce song.. she never really made an impression on me previously. I'm also not much of a country music fan... just never really associated with the culture that has developed around it... but wowwww... Go Beyonce!! Love the update to this conversation! Keep it up!
Not your culture !!!
The question is, whyy even wear one. 😮
WORST SONG EVER
Joke song right?
Another song of "fill all my holes" baby in the Lexus but not in Texas. Country people playing this song when plowing natural fertilizer because that's where it belongs.
Having lived in Alabama! Come on!
Not gonna lie just the same thing and to me wtf is wrong with this?!
This song sucks
😂 trash
I really like this one part. Can we show it over and over  Yes
Most boring Beyonce video ever.
Y'all help an  old  lady out and please tell me where the dance that's on every other video I see coming from?  Apparently, it's too long for Beyonce to do, herself.
More like "this ain't a country song"

wish she didn't have to be sleazy
what is this trash?
She slayy
Ridiculous :/
Here from GMM
This ain’t country music
Music Genres dont exists. if you think I'm wrong look at transgender people.
https://youtu.be/lizBVO4MWFA?si=2zyxtAiW0enhSpEF You're not better than them. Truth hurts
Perfect music for some Cartoon Movie.
Bro all of the sudden got to make a country song the worse I've ever heard like this song is bad
One eye symbolism, As Above So Below symbolism, Satanism at its finest.......
Well goodbye YouTube shorts💀
This is the greatest video ever. I’m just so impressed with how much thought and energy and talent went into this. It must have taken like 10 minutes to do. Great job everybody.
Such an inspiration to young women
The song is ok to listen to but the music video sucks ok seems to me that Beyonce has lost creativity at making music videos cause they're not fun and entertaining as they were before!
REALLY LOW EFFORT VIDEO. Song a 6.
I've changed my mind. I was wrong for saying this wasn't country. I just don't listen to new country cause it sounds like pop I like patsy n David Allen and the old school. She sounds just as if not better than all these new ones out here
Pitiful!!
Gotta be kidding me!!
Trash, trash,Trash and more trash!
this shit is ass
She have to be near naked though🤨
🎉
How about an Austin Powers remake😊
WE WILL NOT WANT TO HEAR AFTER THIS ONE 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When did Beyoncé turn into a town girl😶
...smh
All I see is bouncy boobs 😂
Had this song been recorded by an actual country music artist, 99% of you wouldn’t have given it the light of day. But because it’s Beyoncé, it’s okay. Y’all would eat s*it if the latest trend told you it was okay.
Are you afraid people will not enjoy your music if you don't sell your body with it???
Wait a minute,  is this the actual video fir this song? If so why do people have an actual dance for the song..
Hi stole the show blink blink.
This is to country music what the movie 'Joker' is to Martin Scorsese movies.
Worst shit I’ve heard since the potty song
when you don't know where you are going ,you end up in some other place...
Shits absolutely pathetic I mean just absolutely annoyingly awful lol
This intro reminded me of Adele's "Send My Love"
Do we really need the soft porn to enjoy the music?
This isn’t country and no one in Texas approves of this dog shit🤣
She got lazy on the lyrics
I love it
This song sucks why country like weird
😮
Tits, ass and how many producers?  Beyoncé  070 Shake  BAH  Jon Batiste  Cadenza  Cam  Miley Cyrus  D.A. Got That Dope  Derek Dixie  Dixson  Ian Fitchuk  Harry Edwards  Shawn Everett  Nathan Ferraro  Ink  Tyler Johnson  Paul McCartney  No I.D.  Nova Wav  Dave Hamelin  Killa B  Nick Kobe  Mamii  Simon Mårtensson  Pharrell Williams  Jack Ro  Raphael Saadiq  Sean Solymar  Sounwave  Swizz Beatz  The-Dream  Khirye Tyler  Remember Prince and Purple Rain?  Do you remember how many writers, producers and musicians created that album?  Yeah ....that's right. Just one.  Prince himself.  What's happened to music when all you have to do today is shake your ass to win a Grammy?
🚮
Trashy woman. This is not country.
The song isn’t bad, but the video sucks.
I didnt know black people have blonde hair
Love the song. Thought of a thousand different ways to do this video,  this definitely wasn't one of them. ❤️🇨🇦
SLAY QUEEN
This shit sucks
What kind of MAN allows other men to look upon his wife's nakedness? 😢 WHY?
Hi beyoncé I'm a big fan of you and I just love your songs and I love Texas hold e m like I love the song so much and I like your other country song and I'm listening to it right now
Disappointing to see YouTube's becoming a porn site now
My mom beat me one time for watching her videos. saying there nothing but porn.
Sick and tired of this song!
Great song 🎯
Can I live in texas
Illuminati visuals
Beyoncé making country music is like a cat growing wings and flying, it just dont fit, plus this is one of the worse "country music"songs  i've ever heard in my 15 years of living lol
I was excited for this video as it started... then once I realized my shit wasnt glitching, I was less excited.
Not good at all. Stick to whatever you were doing before...
Good song 💯
Why try to be something you are not. I hope the Franklin kids show owners sue you for stealing their song
You need to stop appropriating my culture.
This is actually bad. Its hard to listen to without cringing.
I love Beyonce, and I love country... but this isn't it for me.
I legit didn’t realize that I watched Beyoncé walk towards me 5 steps on the loop until the end of the video. Every time I noticed a new detail 😂
I’m not a Beyoncé fan but I kind of like this I do
Stolen from real country singers.. Like all music they steal and claim as their own... 😡🤬💩
I am so sorry, the song is good, but this video is just beyond lazy
She really can't write any classic songs. Her songs are generic. If she was white, she would be treated accordingly. But..... Liberalism is the only protected class in America
This is such a stupid song. I hate it.
I meant the performance.. and it’s ok for me to have that opinion. Right?
This is trash
For sure a beautiful song!
0:03- 0:13 Dang
I was legitimately ready to hear Beyoncé sing secret tunnel after hearing the beginning of this song.
This song "SUCKS" it is NOT country music/song by a long shot. Yes, beyonce is a very talented person but NOT singing country music. Recommend that beyonce sticks to the music that has made her the music giant, that she is. The "only" reason this song(which it is not) is on the charts is because of her race. Nothing more, nothing less.
🤔
This is the most offensive and idiotic attempt at country music in history!
Ok so Beyonce has done it again.....
I see she had to throw in her serpent 🐍 satanism attire  We all will take our last breath..and we all get the chance to face the judge
VERY GOOD.....
Bellissimissima canzone
#love-this-song
Is this soft-core porn? I know it's definitely not country music.
So... this ain't Texas... It Ain't no Hold' Em... (So we're not in Texas and we aren't playing poker) Right -\_(O.O)_/-  Then why and even how could I lay my cards down?  Why the bloody hell does the story then switch to a Lexus? And why would I throw my keys up?  and that's where I'm gonna stop with the comment!   These lyrics are an affront to Country Music... the music is... Well, it's only redeeming quality really, because let's be honest the video is 10s on a repeat loop, wow! And the TikTok generation is eating this up like crazy!
Straight garbage 🔥
Her sexy face looks like the 'I'm pushing out a big dump ' face these days.
God I hate this song
Votev Trump
1 💲 🎥 📎😂😂
I'm so glad Beyonce isn't resorting to being half naked to sell some albums...oh wait...
Bruh procducer like drooling and thinking you know what and he was staring the fact Beyoncé has the courage to not wear bra and do this they only have a jacket on
Clip is sucks , but vocal as always awesome
Gay
Ale porywający teledysk😂😂😂 spodziewałem się czegoś więcej to takiej gwieździe
Terrible.
🤦‍♀️
Stole Lana Del Rey’s fire as always releasing an album way before Lana’s announced album later this year. Seems like everyone is following Lana’s changes and gets robbed on her awards to lame music like this. What a shame.
u could legit use ai to make a better quality visualizer absolutely disappointing, lackluster effort in its making
You ate 🎉❤❤❤❤
She needs to be brought down right along side Diddy, Jay Z… She knew of all of it.
This song sucks
HATE IT. What even is this  *Edit*  And why is she SWINGING HER TITS IN THE VIDEO- ohhhh comuz thats all she has to bring to the table… so the title is relevant
Not country for me. Not dressed for a real country girl...
FAKE COUNTRY!!!
I don't understand how this song got popular 😕
i tip my hat darling.
The worst .. too bad that this was the best she could’ve done.
If that jacket moves two inches were done for 🫣
Im from Poland and just have a little knowledge what Texas really is for USA ...But even for me there is smtn wrong with  this song 🤔🤔
Girl!!!! Put a shirt on their kids here your mama teach you
Is this the actual video? After the 3rd scene I'm like huh? Has to be the cheapest music video ever made
This song is soooooooooo BAD 😂😂😂 I can understand why Country  Music didn’t recognize this.
Just gross
Aburrido
This is the damn video ? This can’t be it
She has her boobs out😅😮
This is not good
I was expecting a full on line dance for this song!
Producer -what cow girl clothes are you gonna wear  -Beyoncé - none just a a shirt with my tits out
❤ this song!
They got Diddy Jay-Z is next with Beyonce
There is a full video for the song. That is all  Beyonce needs superb❤❤
this is a racist song from beyonce. once again 😢
this vid has 96K dislikes and I see why
Who calls this country? this just more that horrible Hick Hop that has destroyed real country. And of course, that plastic sell out old cow Parton helped with this junk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCMQRPQS9T4
Y este video está censurado en MTV😂. A la altura de los senos, difuminado... En pleno Siglo XXI.
#herebeforescott
Still not country.
No
Que video tan mas estupido
She aint scared of that vest.
Time up
song is great but why have to include half nudity?? why cant a good song just be without all the sex up crap?? just my opinion
Imagine being so big of a artist your lyrics can be shit
No
Why are so many southerners triggered by this song?
就這樣一直重複bang bang?
Im going to say something.....dont you all fire your cannons at me!!! Now, the song is absolutely great, the video is a dissapointment although it doesnt diminish the whole thing, and then comes the "look"???? Why the almost nude???? In country music???  Parton, Harris, Wynette, Twain never succumbed
Me encanta que ritmo
Beyonce-“this isn’t a contntrey album it’s a Beyonce album” Beyonce-
Beyond your next like P Diddy 🎉
There aint shit country about a Lexus
3:12 damn this sucks
Beautiful lady!
Ah yes the sexualization of women. And also women who complain about being sexualized.  lol. Weird country i'm living in.
It's so funny that she has to use her body to promote her song because it's so bad.
This is cringe
Beyoncé made this after the shower
Just wanted to see what the fuss was all about, and this is kinda good.
She couldn't even be talented or original enough to come up with an original beat.  She copied Franklin the turtle intro song.
This is fake country music
She needa stick to rnb this is hot ass
l Love you from gamma ❤
CULTURAL APPROPRIATION MUCH!?!?!?!
Music is Texas! song /words RNB.. vid…def beyounce.
definition of Queen. literally like a fine wine.  yeesh Bey.
Brooo she did the same thing ove and over again
Eww
Ridicule ...
This aint texas  woow aint no holdem
What a boring video.
❤
This is a good country song, but, doesn’t represent true Country folks. Why does she ALWAYS have to be half naked? Even, on the Red Carpet her Husband is fully dressed, but, she’s always half naked; a Wife, and, a Mother of 3. Sad.
Excuse me
That's porn not country
What a cheap crappy video. They should be able to do better.
Musica buena solo para los gringos, pal resto es mas fome que salir a bailar con la hermana.
❤ we all knew beyonce had talent now see how much more her vocal talent travels and its awesome ❤😊
I’m guessing her next video she’ll be naked. It seems that’s where most artists are heading.
Breaking into a knew scene and let’s arrive with your pistol hanging out 😳no no no, put them away let the song do the work it’s all about the dancing 💃 not cheep look
so damn cool
this is culture appropriation against white people
Tired of seeing her-Great outfit having a young daughter🤦‍♀️no morals
This may be the worst Beyonce song I've ever heard, just my opinion, not my problem if people get offended
I don't see the need to dress like a hoover.
Nothing country at all , sorry but its not , stick to wot your good at its not "country" wont be long to Jayz is sitting beside Puff and the world cant wait🎉🎉🎉
Looking at the comments, I think the world is finally beginning to realise what Beyoncé is.
She will be doing OFs next.
What in the end times is going on here? Beyonce is absolutely garbage.
Well, it's always a matter of taste and what adorable songs this woman has already made, but this really doesn't knock my socks off. Unfortunately, I find the song pretty boring.
It's ok, but it lacks soul. Too much perfanity,It's more like a mockery of Contry Music. The video is too pharmaceutical
J'adore la chanson mais le clip est insupportable à regarder car même si elle est très belle, la répétition de l'image fait mal aux yeux.
CGI FO SURE
Such a Bizarre song for queen B 🤔I dont get it 😂she’s queen b . Beyoncé and she’s doing a line dancing jingle 😮very Bizarre
Why no top only a vest jacket
She has no top on only a Jacket and pants
And the most boring / least creative video in trashiest outfit goes toooooo.... Beyonce 😂😂😂😂
Beyoncé is Beyoncé.
This is américa al estilo de Beyoncé
Would like to hold em 'juggs
Temazo ❤
anyone else turn the radio off when this comes on?
This SONG ISNT COUNTRY MUSIC! It's an INSULT to THE HEART and SOUL , of   REAL LIFE, story telling, no different from SOUL and Rhythm and Blues. Heartship, Love, family, fun, THE STRUGGLE. WTF? ALL she's done is USE, an corny rhythm while completely disrespecting what country is truly about. She ain't country, doesn't know or even care about the world of southerners. Who the heck is behind this crap! Enough. The Devil is A LIE!
“We headed to the dive bar” bro this woman is straight lying lol. She ain’t country and definitely doesn’t go to any dive bars 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️ the song is 🧢 as 🧢 can get
Disaster
Why are you covering your eye!!why are you trying to steal the souls of the pure country folk?? They aren’t gonna fall for that!! Whistle all you want. Try that in a small town !!!!✝️🙏🏼❤️
Wow I love it❤
Summer madness by Kool and the gang
The Power Queen Of The Country. I love you
Video sucks azz, but song sounds great 👌
WTF. This is a repetitive boob video.
Seriously, is this the official video or is it an April Fool’s joke
Esta canción es como estar en red dead 😃♥️♥️
Exhibitionist..trash.
Texas hold em is not country
Nice Cleavage, Song Sucks
Nipples 4 sale here!
I really don't understand she is talented but why does a 42 year old woman need to show her self like this
Stupidest video ever. The woman has a voice, talent and beauty...and she does  this dumb video?
This is devilish I thought there would be some line dancing or something what is this we have real black cowgirls and this is an embarrassment to all cowgirls
This is horrible.
She Can Do Everything 💯
No 😅
Should have used single ladies  dancers
Mmm ñe
Get this off my page and don’t claim it’s Texas…. No it’s not
snake around the kneck
Pure bulllshit
I would actually like the blue and white Peterbilt
I love this omg, her voice is so amazing for this genre
Woman must have the corner market in breast tape and spirit glue!
QUEEN 🔥🔥
Nasty!! Real country girls have enough class to dress like women not hose!!
Beyonce 2024 cowboy queen
Wow! Can we say disappointing!!! Where is the old western saloon country line dancing vibe! TOTAL MUSIC VIDEO FAIL!!! I think B should take her mulligan & come back with something she actually put some energy into!
🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮
Garbage....
Not only is this NOT country music, this video also proves just as such.  I will not be playing this on my country radio station if I have anything to say about it We wear clothes in the country, this isn't LA. Go home
she try 2 hard
This is not a country song
This is a terrible video! Same thing. Over and over. The boobs were a bit much.
songs ok, crap video
Such a pointless video.. lazy
Fantastic music  love it. No need for her to be half naked.. why? Littke girls love B, so why does she have to dress like this?
This shit is so trash
Way to ruin the idea of country  music. That was her goal tho. This aint country, so go away way way way way ❤
AMEIII ❤
This bih hard b Ian gon lie
This sucks
This sucks
This song sucks!!!!!!!
#Grupofrontera
Combia( grupo fronte ft bad bunny 😅😅😅😅😮😮😮
I hate this so much. My opinion oh well.
K the video sucks but whoever supports hootie moving country rollin over with his wagon wheel needs to shut their pie hole. Song is catchy so soft brains will love it but it too is not country by any means, also sucks like p diddy at a upside down pineapple party
Thumb down
L
Stoooop
She’s literally just did the same thing over and over😂❤
Again, this is not country music. It's R&B with a bit of a country twist.
Love you
I love this song❤
Beyonce I haven't seen a video yet just all the dancers but I love the way you do things
How much likes I get I’ll do a Ariel promise
have yall noticed her hand is in the shape of texas
Ok I figured out the whistle tune. That’s from Allman Bros Jessica, the guitar lick in the bridge
Hiii
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYeKvrccoDI Here is an actual cover version 1000 times better than this crap. It's sung by James Otto. A REAL COUNTRY ARTIST!!
Good song,  but she's too full of herself.  Her fans deserve more.
https://youtu.be/fmpHbkm2fFE?si=EIQtt1jKUQhbpVkA
Still a pop song not country because you can say or sing texas
She's looking desperate
Beyoncé is a star.
Dog shit💀
I just came here to say that I don't really like this song,   but I do like it a lot more than any modern country song.   So there's that.
💯❤️🤘✊⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽⛽
This song is so dogshit😭
If I hear this sound again I’m gonna explode
Well as a big fan of country I wouldn’t have thought she could pull it off but by golly she did.  This is really a good toe tapping song.
Sounds like sh*t
My opinion,but this is an awful song,come on Beyonce you can do much better❤
Is youtube broken why is this a loop
I came here to hate, but this is better than most of the modern mainstream country. I still wouldn't call it country but it's definitely inspired by the genre and does a wonderful job paying homage
This song sounds better in 1440p 60fps
This ain't Country at all. This song absolutely sucks. All you did, Beyoncé, was put twang in the gang. Just because you're from Texas doesn't mean you're Country. Southern, yes, but not Country. This song is just like the other crap you put out in the last 25 years. The only thing different is this song ain't autotuned. Give it up. You better put some actual steel guitars and mandolins in your music, then maybe I'll reconsider. Until then you're just Southern Hip-hop, not Country.
Everybody hyping this song up and it’s TRASH and her voice is HORRIBLE singing it.
Put some clothes on woman.
Either way, love it all the same! I also love Hank and George!
Manje golotinje Sotonjarske,pjesma je ok.
Willie nelson rolling over in his bed listening to this
Wtf my play list is at least 6yrs old ..yet this song is .ike HOV ..like it..lot younger    :)
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
2:24 girl you look so pretty like I like your song but you need to add twin where have you been because my mama look like me and you look like your mommy and my mommy look like me I’m a girl, you a girl make sure nobody bully you when you were a kid and somebody’s bully you bullying them bully them because if somebody mess with you fight them, don’t even worry about them don’t even go to the principal office OK I like your song thank you it’s 4:55
This song is ass
🤣
Where is the video? Is this it?
Shes not country. Nothing about this is country. Shes trying to stay relevant
High winds today
Video sucks,  song cool
This is not country it sounds like crap country music singers would put you to shame Beyonce!!!!
That's a no for me
beyonce got that middle aged mom body. yuck
cool song but is the actual video for it? so not like her……
this is the most god aweful attempt at country music ive ever heard.
WE GOING TO TEXAS AFTER THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Me encantó está versión, pero el vídeo es horrible
This is a terrible song
Look at the black girl stealing the white people culture.
What a load of shit.
This Lyrics is one of the worst I've ever heard. "So park your Lexus, and throw your keys up." Why the heck should I do this. I really can't believe that people like this shi*
Disgrace to country music. She’s trying to win over the country music fans so she can push her satanic agenda on them and continue the downfall of our country.
I’m sorry but this is not country, stop calling this a country song
Terrible
I thought she was singer... looks more like a Stripper!
Wish women could stay properly clothed in order to sell their music.
Y'all will dickride anything the A-lists drop. I'm laughing in your face if I hear this in public.
I didn't know beyonce could get worse. I didn't know she could make me like country less than I already do. Jesus christ. I could throw cow shit at a violin and it would sound better.
Another joke for the woke.
This is not country
She ain't country. She's a disgrace. We Country Folks reject you.
The video is just doing the same thing over and over but i dont care the song is exquisite ❤
Trash
Like the song...the video yall can keep frfr 😂
And further.  Keep the buttons on your shirt done up.  Exposure cannot hide your complete failure with this type of music.
This is not country at all!
A shambles from start to finish.  No respect for black artists who wrote great lyrics in this genre.  Why is she poking at Taylor Swift of many years ago.  Walk into a Beverly Hills store,  buy a hat an some chaps. I don't enjoy either Swift  or Beyonce,  but this us shameful.  Like Elvis turning into a punk or a late 60s hippie.  Get a grip.
Hip Hop must be doing bad rn in generating revenue because that is the only reason why i believe beyonce made a country album.
Is it about country or sex?
Pensé que se me había trabajo el celular 😅😂
Omg what is this 😳  you've got to be kidding me... ugh so sad
What a disappointing video!
beat selection: trash 🗑️  Lyricism: trash 🗑️  Cadence delivery flow: all trash 🗑️  Cut this shit off

I mean it sounds like it should be country but its just missing soul
Wow!
High price hooked lol
This is garbage!
She is not country and just sounds “Ghetto!”
Tired of bossy people, but in some way she helps me face those useless people 🤔
This song is generic and just garbage
This sucks.😂 The video is terrible. If she wasn't half naked no one would watch. Maybe turn off the sound. Nope still terrible.
Some of those real country women would whoop ya dressing like that,  your not country Beyonce,   if you wa t to be you'll have to dress better  than that.  I'm country,  I know.
Like the song- still Adele never needs to undress to sell. So what is being sold??
This is not country music. You can’t prove me wrong.
Beyonce is a beautiful singer, however, none of her Country songs sound Country.  But Country is turning more pop anyway.
Great song love it💯🎶🤟, not sure wtf going on with video, compared to her other songs🤷‍♂️
This song BLOWS. Generic and bland. Nothing spectacular about it.
this is not country this is pop
Uncomfortable team ⇩
Disgusting
I came here to hate but I’ll be damn not bad.
It's a no for me..
it was like a train wreck,,, i just could not look away until I noticed her video was only in a short loop of meaningless skin and bling.  Oh wait this is Merika  SMH
👎👎👎👎 I would play this on the fishing banks 🤣🤣🤣
Hey it’s Franklin
What an imagination!! Couldn’t change it up a little. I’ll stick to SHANIA!!! A million times she’s BETTER!!
Next song title is "Duct Taped Nipples"
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been Shazamed over 1.5 million times! Keep Shazaming "Cowboy Carter" songs! It helps with radio play! 👑🐝🤠
W
Horrible. Does she have a mouthful of marbles? Can she perform without over showing her body parts? So over it😮
I’m gonna say it: They’re trying to destroy white culture
Man, these lyrics are appallingly bad. You'd think after creating a fun tune and arrangement that more effort would have been spent on communication!
Jesus loves yall 🙏🏾
Love
Her popularity must be dipping. She was going to sing with her horse, but the horse was too embarrassed and galloped away. Stay away from Country Music and stick with the Hip Hop swill.
He’s on the way sooner than later
I am
I didn’t like young Beyoncé, but she’s gotten hotter to me the older I get.
I love you muice
You said it Beyonce, “this ain’t Texas”, this also is not country and it’s disrespectful to so many. Your for sure stepping on toes 😂😂😂😂
I hope she performs this at CMA
It was crap
A really shitty cash grab. Stay in your fuckin lane
Imagine black culture taking over country like white culture did rock haha
She really needs to stop with the country stuff… shes not it. To us country girls, this is hilarious & disrespectful at the same time.
While the song is great, the video sucks!  Okay, you have nice breast! Those belong to Jay-Z, not me!  I am not interested at looking at another man's wife's breast!

Gotta keep in mind this is a VISUALIZER not a MUSIC VIDEO js
https://youtube.com/@HHHarogeri?si=NwI8CWb0HnOIfnxI
George Strait is country not you
Once Pop always pop
This ain’t real country music
So now with all her power, she uses it to screw over young girls and women entering the industry who still feel forced to be over-sexualised. I know she's not really a feminist but wow.
Girl you do not have the voice for country music. I really don't think you even know what country music is! US country folk don't dress like you either
Anytime soon?
this fake country af if it what’s real country it would be Chevy instead of Lexus an she would be in the woods or on a farm.
I don't know how true this is.  But I heard that Beyonce said that with this song she saved Country music.  Now it really doesn't sound like something she would say.  It sounds just like the douchey comments Kanye says.  But if anyone is ever questioning whether country music needed saving, the answer is NO.  They do not.
nothing authentic nor coming from the deep heart of genuine music - fabricated manipulative forgotten in a few weeks
Hooker outfit seems the norm these days.....
.....yeah. now hopefully all the "cultural appropriation!!!" Parasites will STFU now.
Not only is this song kinda meh, But like, Why is she naked? This is a bit lazy dontcha think?
Well I'm not loving it and I'm not a fan of B but, I'm not mad she is going country. She is from Texas and has country roots.  Jolene was horrible tho
There is no artistic value what so ever in this song or music video,
I don't like this song 😐🔨
Why is the entire video just 1 clip repeating? This is so stupid, the song sux and this video is just 1 clip played over and over , completely idiotic stupid shit
eh mid
🤘❤️💙🤍
Got that eye covered again. Hmm
Why? She's so beautiful so why does she need to look like she's in the bedroom?😮
If this isn’t one of the greatest albums ever made then idk what is
it’s so funny how many ppl are ignoring the “official visualizer” that’s stated in the title. lmao this isn’t a music video
This album is awful
lol, I heard it was lame, but... lol
I’m sorry Beyoncé but wyf is this
Put some clothes on Mother.
Omg girlll
Songs catchy, video sucks
Best song on the album in my opinion i can play this song everyday no cap
Please cover your ears from her and Taylor, and all the other demonic singers that want your soul people say it’s fun and games, but Lil Uzi didn’t say people are going to hell with him for listening to his music for no reason please be careful run back to God run back to Jesus he knows the way the truth and the life he wants to help you if you allow him don’t be upset with him for the things that the people did to you that wasn’t God❤
Just in case anyone may need it  🥺💜 this I pray so many ppl watch and know JESUS CHRIST is Lord and savior he is amazing and he loves you . He wants you to heal . And come home you don’t have to face life alone not only will you have him if you accept him as Lord you’ll have a family behind fighting Thru life together if you ever need prayer I’m always here just know when you as for repentance it’s so freeing come home DONT  let the world distract from you true purpose the devil wants to kill steal and destroy. We don’t want u to suffer anymore life already hard 😢❤🦋
There should be Texas line dancing in this not her walking around half naked. Just my opinion.
When she say this gonna take long ok producer mhm do IT for long …… but wtf
What a disappointing video to a great song. That top is too much I'm afraid.
Bad video...😢
This song is 2024
I think the fact that this is a 10 min production is the gangsta shit I seen
trash
This is the most stupidest video I’ve ever seen!! Nothing country about this song! It sucks 😂 so does the video 😅
I love things that make gringos mad haha
I finally like contry music
I don’t know what the hype all about
Damn, this aint country, get in where you fit in girl!
What would John and Paul create if they were asked in their prime to create a country song.  Regardless of the ability to create fast, I don't think Ai would be able to out shine those two.  I personally enjoyed the heck out of this song.  Charlie Pride enjoyed playing pro baseball but not as much as he enjoyed entertaining us with his country music. Beyonce is amazing and creative and I would enjoy it if Charlie was still with us and he and B created a song they sing together.
This shit trash
This song is so fucking annoying ....
Save our country Fuck Biden
TITTEN!!!
This sucks 😂😂😂😂😂
my god…the harmonies 😍😍😍
Well if this is considered country these days might as well go ahead and put me six feet under because she just killed the genre
I love country, but the real one, the one that comes out of the soul, this is her fashion, it's a bad joke and an insult to the musical genre
WTF is this shit? Looks like the  start of a porno!
😂
😂
This generation really needs to repent.  If you are following artists like Beyonce and the rest of these perverted artist don't think that u are saved. Now is the time to repent.
Wonder what Sitting Bull would think of this?   Yeeehaaaaa....... what a cool vibe by n even cooler Beyonce
Great song, bad video.
Sweet.
All of us
None of these comments makes sense either you like the song or you don't 😂
Disgusting
Wear bra 🙏
This is definitely not country lol unless your definition of country is Taylor Swift and Florida Georgia Line
This isn’t country
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
HAHHAHAHHAHAAHHA!!!!! Stop.
いい!!!🎉 テイラーに負けてない😆
Beyonce made a country album with RNB vibes?  Yee haw I be damned!!!!!!!
Beyoncé you’re a big ass woman with grown children. You’ve done it all! 👏🏽 No need for the half naked performances 👎🏾 and what’s g- strings and breast and bottie out of door, got to do with country and western?? My my, why do women think naked is “Sexy?”  Sexy comes from within, it’s got nothing to do with showing your all, and then some! Go check out Shania Twain singing country, in that long leopard skin coat, trousers, top, and hat……. Now that look is “Sexy” and she’s fully clothed!! I think it’s time to rethink your wardrobe B, and stop behaving like you’re still in your 20’s!  Be a role model for our young girl’s, and stop being an advocate for sluttish outfits and behaviour! I love your music from the past, and I’ve got no problem with country and western music either, but the video does not reflect my understanding of that genre of music. Grow up, and don’t become laughable, like the late, great Madonna!! ✌🏽❤️
It is a nonsense music with a shitty video people, come on
gyatt
❤❤
Long before Beyonce you had the Pointer Sisters singing  country music. https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=tQWgKvvbT1g
we get it they are real
I am not feeling this
I searched for this song just knowing Ms. Bey would have some cool dance routine to go along with it……. what?!? 🤔
Wow
Doesn’t she make enough money to afford a shirt?  They sell them at Walmart for five bucks.
Funny thing is 😂that jelly roll was the first person who got hip hop and rap artist  to country' first..pluse he has soooo many juggalos so sorry to burst your bubble
Its April 2024, let's see how many legends are listening to this incredible song🤭
Everytime swift does anything they call it copy or fake. But I am sure miss perfect wont get any of that crap 😅
Like many of you, I did not come here for the song.
Just upload a lyrical version if can’t afford video
Wtf
MY BABY COUSIN, 17 MONTHS WAS DANCING TO THIS BEYONCÉ SONG , JUMPING AND ALLAT
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
L♡ve it 🔊🔥🔥🔥🔥
amazing
Yeah this isn’t even close to country not what true country music is
Yaas shes nice
THIS IS BOM
How tf ppl be enjoying this
So f*cking annoying song it’s just like $hit fr
Naked country....never thought I'd see it.
country music is a whole hella lot more classy than this outfit good song though
Does anyone other than black racist woman still listen to beyonce ?
So apparently some folks think black people should NOT be playing country. They need to Wikipedia DeFord Bailey. He was the FIRST ever musician to record a song in Nashville (in 1926). He was also one of the artists to appear on the very first Grand Ole Opry in  January 1927. The fact is, black people were there from day one.
Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. He loves you so much that he died for and rose from the dead. He is the only way to salvation, and we all must repent and turn our hearts to him. Jesus loves you and he wants you.
💩
Catchy song
תאוריה
Smh what happened to real country music now we got this crap
Rhianna Givens on the banjo carries this entire song
I hate this song it is the worst 😷 💩
Love Rhiannon Giddens' banjo on this
This is absolute trash
Why do performers artists now have to constantly look like whores? Ugh
Reeeeeeeport her
Is she serious  or just throwing lyrics  together and try n make a mockery of texas or  country music  she being foolish with this one here

Tell that trash heap country music is classy. Put some clothes on.
We got country Beyoncé before GTA 6🙏🙏🙏
The only country song out of her whole album
La musique na pas de limites,  il faut q'on avance.  ❤❤bravo madame.
🐉
That is really gross.
This sucks. This is folk pop or country pop at best. And those are the worst kind of country
Bad effort in making a music video
This has nothing on Gracies corners version
I love this song so much I am upset💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😘😘😘😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
Too bad she couldn't sing with Charlie Pride😢
A snake on the left eye?................... COULD YOU BE MORE FREEMASONIC?
❤❤❤❤❤ 0:43
We losing the food stamps with this one.
lame
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nunca, nadie, jamas😅😂
First time ive liked a Beyonce track. 😂
Hab alle ihre großen Videos nachgetanzt...was ist das bin enttäuscht
Their are many examples of good black country singers, Beyoncé ain’t one of them, I’m sorry but this isn’t a genre she should touch again cause it’s just not for her
Boring 🥱 same bs walking and pew pew.Can’t wait until the filthy list of Diddy comes out.
Sorry but this is NOT a good song. It is way over-hyped in the media.   It sounds like it was written by AI. It is not catchy in a good way, but it sticks in your head in an annoying kind of way. The lyrics don't make sense-- it's supposed to be a country song but says it's NOT Texas? Beyoncé was from Houston, but it's NOT Texas?  Nothing about this makes sense, I'm tired of the hype.  I normally like her vocals and it's cool to see someone try a crossover, but this just isn't a good song and it's over-hyped by the media.  I'm tired of hearing it everywhere, stop trying to shove this song down our throats. It's a 4 out of 10, maybe a 5 at best.
She is knows nothing about Texas she should not since about something she knows nothing about... She is a talentless demon
I have never listened to her music.  I think music today is dead.  Alright, I am 39 and have been listening to music most of my life.  I have always like older artists.  Those from the 60s-90s.  I enjoy every type there is.  That being said, what in the hell is this.  How would one call this country.  The instrumental part, just like in the song her and Cyrus sing, conflicts with the vocals.  This is awful.  Rock on trying a different type of music.  But at least try.  I mean, It seems to be generalizing the genre.  I am surprised the video was not just a fat white man dancing with a swine.  Come on.  At least try.
Nope. Ain't Country. Sounds like she's making fun of Country music.
That is the worst out fit I have ever seen she should fire the person that puts her this an the one's that wouldn't even look good on a young woman
PLEASE DONT RUIN COUNTRY MUSIC...is nothing sacred???
Don't hate it but it's not authentic at all. She wouldn't be found dead in a dive bar.
Why she look like a Borg from Star Trek?
One eye with a snake over the other. Signs in clear sight. Smh
WHY GET RID OF THIS FKCING SUOOKIINGBGGYGGGG
Ridiculous video bla
Okay this sounds great. I was not in a rush to listen to her new songs
❤❤❤❤I like it's music
Bro did you know there are 3 year olds on this app
Good song ,but the video sucked hope the video didn't cost any thing to make.
Give it up! You butchered Jolene, such a beautiful song
She needs to learn the whole dance. This video has no feel. Just saying!
Why do you always have to be naked and every frigging thing you?Do you think this is good for young girls to see this?While you're playing with yourself in front of man viewers on the internet.And then what do you think they do when they leave their homes to young girls that are roaming around your former neighborhood when you were poor but now they are, are you out of your mind?Wanted to get your act together and be a role model for young women instead about you know what
Producer : We should do a clip for that song Beyoncé : I have just 10 seconds for that Producer : Hold my Gif
Don't be a bitch pee.😅😂
She isn't country. She's Creole.
This is trash 😂
nope! 🤢🤮🤮
I don't get it, what does this visualise?
Like no country video iv ever saw but I do like the song you did a good job
Franklin: 😡
I love it!
Not country.  Stupid song
Trying to pass this off as country.  Lol.
Gostei da música, do clip não
Now what would JZ think😂
Do not even dancing what the heck
Who doesn't  like this amazing song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sik tune😊 any one 2025?😊
😅y😅😅😅going 😅 I’m
Whit-choo  What?
Horrific visualiser. Still better than any taylor swift song anyday. Can’t find a song by TS that I appreciate
L woman
This is cultural appropriation.
Finish lyrics: this ain’t texes
The things will do to sell music
Beautiful  ❤
Hello Beyoncé do you like your younger fans, say your daughters age, watching this and modeling after it?
a snake over her left eye... yeah devil worshipper
excelente rola pésimo vídeo
This was terrible
Normally I love Beyoncé’s songs, but this is just horrible…why is she just repeatedly walking out half naked and making pew pew fingers? Oh sweetheart, please go back to your regular music and videos; your better than this.
I do not like her new country music.
❤️💙🤍
Girl, this song is good, but the video is not giving country vibe. Literally I don’t even know what I just watched. Literally, it’s the same thing repeating.
Hi Skyler
No.
This is the biggest trash can dog shit Iv ever seen and heard
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Chads who don't simp over her team 🗿 👇
😮😮😮😮😮😮WTF
Could only afford to shoot a 20 second video,  just looping it for 4 minutes
Why can we see your boobies?…..
Anyone who claims they hate country music but they like this country song by Beyonce…first off, this is an embarrassment to people who like country music…it takes more than blurting out words like “boots” “spurs” to make a song country. This song is an over produced piece of crap that is only popular because it’s Beyoncé. I’m all for artists trying to reinvent themselves, but this is not country music
Verschrikkelijk
Traaaaaaaaash song
I hate everything about this and everyone who supports this trash
She ran out of ideas…😂 leave country alone… leave it to the ones that know how to make it sound right … she doesn’t have the voice for a country song…🤣
This is fkn horrid. But hey the sheep love it.
her music is trash!
Why is she half naked ?
0:40 was so great
Corny :/
💩🤠
Lazy lazy video.. Please tell me it is a bad fan edit.
This video is ludicrous
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY
I bc Texans like cops 😂
Jesus loves you so much . He died for you ❤
I fell like just watched a porno
Sounds like R&B with a Banjo.  I'm not impressed.
After hearing this, i need her and darius rucker to do a song now.
I’ve heard the song but this is the first time I’ve seen the video and it’s dead
epic
Sorry but this ain't Country music! This is someone TRYING to write Country music! Not to mention cultural appropriation???
Pathetic grift
Thats not Country Music..... This is Crap.
CAN'T SING = SHOW TITTS... SONG SHITTY AND CRINGE
Nope....terrible!
GARBAGE SONG
What?!😂
Great now this racist lib is going to ruin country for me smh 🤦🏻‍♂️.
i hate this fucking video and the song....
Fantástica canción, mierda de letra y de video...
Beyoncé trusts that jacket soo much
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If Beyoncé can have that much confidence in that vest, you can ask that girl out
Never knew country can be this naked! Does she really have to do this to sell albums?
I don’t really get her angle, I’m not gunna lie. She gets snubbed by country fans so she goes on to create an overproduced pop-country album that fans have been criticizing since long before she made a country song.   It’s some female empowerment, self-aggrandizement project if you ask me. Not a genuine attempt to connect with the country audience.
April 1, 2024. Miss Beyonce. If a German band can sing for European Cultural Survival, then why aren't YOU Defending African Unity & Survival!! I stand by Mine! You will stand by Youre's! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0jq4rke8kw
What the hell has Oldham a town near Manchester got to do with Texas ?
First time watching this video and have to say…. Her outfit ruins this song… she is not empowering young girls one bit, rather she’s sending them down the trash path…. I’m sorry but I do not approve of this… Beyoncé - stick to low class videos and stay away from family country videos.
😂😂😂
Don't mold your life after Beyonce
This is ass
Beyonce is not a country artist. She is a pop artist who made a country-like album for some reason.
I'm obsessed with this song😊
❤️💙🤍
Is this a joke? Her vocals & lyrics are nothing country & the beat doesn’t work with her slow vocals. Truly a disgrace & diss song to country. 😢
Put some clothes on
Umm..no.
Illuminati Who Oar
Looks like a man. 😂
Beyoncé is just selfish she’s mad she wasn’t the first black woman to win a country award.  You know your real motive. Your country music wack. White people will never vote for you
OMG . Please watch my high boobs that's the message
I was never a fan of country, but now I'm really turned off🤮
She's REALLY desperate to get those views back from Taylor Swift isn't she?
isso aqui vai ser um hit de festa junina desse ano em diante
What a bullshit video. Sad performance. Everybody look on the body, nobody listen to the words.... no message, only titts. Sad mummy-message.
Some oen yalk forget its a VIZUALIZER not a MV theres a huge difference
Beyoncé embodies all the beautiful feminine bombshells out there! You just can’t stop her!
It has to be here worst song yet! Do better!!
Kayne West’s gonna have problems pushing Taylor Swift outta the way for this one!
Song okay video sucks ass repeat after repeat after repeat after
Good Lord, that was a waste of time. God is watching you evil
Whitewashing to be a country singer. Pathetic.
So its her first country song, so for the video she gets half naked and has no production value.....just so people would talk about it
WTH is she wearing 😂
As someone who really hates country, I have to say that this is easily the best album of the year, and a possible contender for best album of the decade.
My name is Alexis
Ummmm....
I love you Beyoncé you are my favorite singer ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
she's so classy.  I'm sure Jay is appreciating this smh
It is obvious  you have a great voice but why wear tacky outfits. Not a good look girl
Why is she half naked? Blacks make everything ratchet wtf
This is poser country music
Apparently your robbing that kinda gezzers true or not kill this voice
why is it that women as they get older have to try and show that their body hasn't fallen apart yet? Body looks plastic. Not country at all.
Oh yeah yea haw You go girl. All I need now is a pair of cowgirl boots. Do you have any designs in mind? 🤩🤩🤩
Well the only thing she's got is no clothes cause she ain't country at all.  😂😂😂
THIS AINT TEXAS
Is Beyonce running the Thunderdome now?
We need a ft TINASHE
She dam near dissed texas
What does it mean to have a repeating over and over again? I don't get it.
🎉
Is this a music video or onlyfans?
🐝 🐝 🐝
Although I'm doing hm when I hear this song I NEED TO DANCE 😂
It's just another form of rap different lyrics
T R A S H Y, I would be appalled if my daughter ever dressed like this in public.
Sit back  and inhale 😂😂❤❤❤
she best worry about them cops comin for her and gay-Z instead of puttin out garbage
This song  sucks. She is no country artist. Disgrace to country music.
why half-naked? not country
Beyonce's interpretation of country music is kind of interesting.  Why is she doing country?  Is this a new trend?  I don't hate it.  I would really like to listen to her interpretation of a country standard like Jolene or a Patsy Cline song.
Fuq this song is so bad😂
She does  the same thing over and over again for the holl video
REALLY NOT A BIG FAN OF HER, But seriously she’s Killin it👌🏼TRUE TALENT LADY ❤🎉
l love you from gemma ❤
Country music has such awesome fashion...why naked?  This is a pass for me
Just when I think she can't get any lower Beyonce you have even dirtied up country. That is just shameful
What a dumb video
❤️💙🪩
I love this song
What is this monstrosity?
Why does she have to be naked?
I actually liked this song until I saw this cheezey video. Disappointed! :(
TERRIBLE MUSIC VIDEO
People saying we don’t like the song because we are racist are hilarious 😂 we don’t like it because it is legit fucking trash. Y’all do know Darrius Rucker is a black man correct? And he is one of the best at country this generation. Beyoncé tried country and sounds like complete shit😂 throw it in the trash.
What a steaming pile of shit this is lol wow
Remember the white guy that got trashed for singing Jamaican? Now an African American singing country is being supported 😂 what a joke. Burn Loot Murder ✊🏿
Making country music sound like absolute trash.
This is the stupidest thing ever! 😆
There are many good things to about America, but this is definitely not one of them. Came here to see the newest top playing hit. 1.37minutes was enough
Hmmmmm not bad :)
Heu holã de la France qui souri doucement...c'est quoi ce clip ? Pendant 2mnt elle fait la même chose 😂😂😂 c'est ridicule !!!!! Mdr 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
No one: Wtf did I just watch💀😭 edit: Thanks to 171 likes!
Didn’t realize the video was just her doing the same damn thing over and over smh I couldn’t finish this
Love This   wow!  I feel like dancing the cowboy dance
Love the song, hate the video
Shit video
Damn she shoulda of had a bad ass dance to go with this song the videos wack tf she could of had all us grove en i dont even know how to dance to this bob my head lol
Was never a Beyonce fan, but holy hell, ill lol, be damned i am now!
shame...
It's got to be the cheapest budget for a video - maybe $4.99 😊
Diosa
why no belly button
this stripper really can sing...who is she?
Love the song - country/western/cowboy music suits her well. Hate pop, but can love this.
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
I love this song but it reminds me of my favorite Korn song thoughtless from the untouchables album from my childhood
Barbara Cooper,  TAKE ME EASY 1976 Original Folk/Country Doylen-Records.
Somethings gonna happen to the state of Texas soon.
a part montrer ses miche et ses bas il y a rien pffff desespoir
le clip qui a couté 2€50 franchement tres nul....
Never liked country to begin with and this brought that hate to a whole new level.
Dub
Ummmm what's with this video? Surely Beyonce can do better than one scene of finger pistols on repeat for 4 minutes
WOW!!! SEXEE OUTFIT!!!❤
Horrible what a awful song from a great songstress...l feel like she's lost her way in the dark forest & forgot to leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find her way back. I really hope she finds herself again.
Literally THE WORST song she’s ever made. This shit play repeatedly at my job and it’s so damn annoying that I want to jab my pen in my ears. Way too overrated and they’re forcibly overplaying it too acting like it’s getting requested when it’s not
HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING AND HER FOLLOWERS
Her outfts are so disrespectful.   I stopped  being a fan years ago.  Just stopped to see what mess she created this time 😢
Very good music video
Love the song, hate the video. Enjoyed watching Ugandan children dancing to this better. What happened to your outstanding choreographer?
So catchy but looks like Beyonce is coming to destroy wholesome country music now. You want our kids repeating, "shit ain't pretty/bitch/pour some liquor on me/tuck back oops???" While dressed like a sex slave, wearing glasses with a snake over one eye? She's coming for country music. look out y'all.
I’m sorry but I think this song sucks
Heard this song and I said I liked her voice on this.  Didn't really listen to the words.  All 5 of the other people at my table went nuts.  Not a good review. Said she was dressed in a street walker and was actually being anti country.
Seems like these videos for this album only promote guns and sex....sad
Good stuff
Damm🥵
Sad whars being done to country
She is so entertaing, i love your enegy Beyonće!❤
The genre makes no difference, she is the Queen of all!!!
The absolute worst thing i have seen.
If there is a Backlash with Beyonce; its not this Country Song. It's the rumors of her and Jay Z association with DIDDY! But I also say if you are going to go Country; don't do it dressed trashy singing about Bit ches!
Beyonce forgot to dress. The song isn't even country.
Wtf? This is horrible 😮
Some people should stay away from country😮
Nice 👍
Maybe try to record and not pre record 1/2 scenes and repeat them
She is too old to be flaunting her body like that. She is a mother....not good Byonce. Need to start setting an example.
Why does she look like an AI country BOT!

She has a lovely voice but being dressed this way does seem silly.  Undermines her vocal talent…Who is advising her? Fire them.
OMG YALL IM RELATED TO HER BUT LIKE 100 YEARS DOWN THE LINE! BEYONCÉ DONT EVEN KNOW! OMG IM OLIVIA BTW! Edit: PLS BLOW THIS UP SO SHE SEES THIS!
Why dont beyonce leave country music alone
This song suck the only reason I kept watching to see of em girls would pop out
I love me some Beyonce, but she's not country!
Q mierda de canción, hablo en serio
👹🤮
I hate this song delete this song
It’s everywhere make it stop
Great song and talent, but this video is stupid.
The most boring video in music history!!! 😂
I don't like this song
was this a joke or satire?
This is the worst song that I have ever heard
It’s funny how this is censored on MTV but WAP isn’t
Hey its Franklin....Coming to your house😂
🥱 🥱 🥱 😴
Beyoncé just overall fantastic superhero type artist and any country industry that has a problem with artist evolving in there craft and hating because she mastered it get it Queen Bey 🎉 keep making em sweat
cringiest line ever!  that opening line makes me throw up 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
@1:58 I’m waiting on all the dance off videos 😂
I hate this song so much
Yee ha!
Yellowstone
Can she do country roads?
Anybody for talk of CULTURAL APPROPRIATION? Or does a BLACK woman, Beyonce, get all kind of passes?
Sucks 👎👎👎👎
I like Guns and Roses, Alyson Morissette, Red hit Chili peppers. Metallica ect. As long as it makes you feel good. It's just music.
Use me as the dislike button
Stupidest music video I've even seen.
Absolutely Horrible 😂😂😂
Tell me how this is country your not a country artist it doesn’t sound country at all so don’t even try and act like you are your like the wish version of a Taylor swift country song from 12 years ago
This ain’t country, so don’t play it. (This ain’t Texas so don’t hold them)
C’est quoi ce truc 😃😂
Is the most cringes song she ever made she ever made it stupid
I don't think it's the jacket lol!!!!!
I guess franklin was a better song.
While the song isn't too bad, the video stunk. Nothing like a scantly clad 40 something woman doing the same thing, the whole 3 n some minutes.
I’m a liberal person but I’m sick of her  barely having clothes on.  What message are you sending to your daughters? Sex sells and your vocal talent isn’t enough??
This is the first song ive listen from her. Its not a bad song to listen to. Its like a road trip song to be honest. I say ill give a 3.6/5.
Johnny Cash, the Carters, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette. That  was country music. This ain't even a wannabe.
Great song
Trashy
It doesn't say Texas hold em in the hole song it just says this ain't Texas ain't no hold em it doesn't say Texas hold em at all
Horrible song
I'm already getting stories of Country Music's  "Untold African Origins" 😂
What the hell would she know about country besides music, I bet she's never done a hard day's work in her life, she's probably never even been on a farm.
🔥🔥🪩🔥🔥
I grew up in a truck country thus is not country....not even near
Put a shirt on lady
Sorry, but this video is stupid.
Where are your clothes woman. And to think you are a role model to millions of people 😢 failed society. Well done
❤
Tryna dance with you
Where is the mouth movement?
The young Tina Turner
Trashy artist I've seen.  This is not  creative at all. No wonder I listen to more K-pop because Western's dont take about artist anymore. Very tasteful and talentless
This is sad your showing your body to the world this is outrageous and inappropriate and you better hope your children does not do this when they get older! Ur a horrible example! And I’m a child and I’m going on YouTube finding the most horrible God mockers in The USA I have done all the other ones now it’s ur turn. Turn from your sins repent and Ask God to deliver you from this! I’m warning you.
Wow how much I love this song she well the jacket btw
Love it
Jay-Z is a lucky man
If you think this is a country song your brain is smaller then her jacket
This must be a world record for speed running ruining country
This might be the worst country song ever.
MID
I think that video 📸📷 it's sexy 😏 and funny 🤣 What do you think 🤔
Just bc your from Texas doesn’t make this country 😭🙏
Beyoncé is so talented to make me look beyond  the terrible video and her outfit 😂❤
This song is not country music it’s not real country
Bro she basically inappropriate cause she has no shirt on or nothing like Umm
This video just sucks .
eeeeewwww!!!🤢🤮
🤠
Well if rumors are true shes about to be single.
my daughter saw this video put a shirt on bro
The video is boring cause she does the Same thing over and over again
It's hard to put into words how much this song sucks, but I'll try...this song sucks. Hey! It worked!😋
Aburridismo…
Since country is about emotion and sadness maybe you should write a song about how ur husband murder Cathy White and their baby for you. That seems pretty sad for her family. But obviously not for u.
once again a NO SKIP album for me, from Beyoncé .. once again hard work, once again she's giving us something different and new regarding the previous projects, once again she's showing generosity with more than 20 tracks in a album, once again she's taking risks, etc, etc.   Now listen dear Grammy Awards : DON'T MAKE FUN with us (once again) and give her that AOTY. "RENAISSANCE, Act I" is still buzzing worlwide, what about "Harry Styles and his album (of the year)" ?!
If she wants to win the White Bred Country folks, put some damn clothes on.
I don't see this as country music, but it's certainly better than bro country bull.
Can't stand her, but this song is not too bad. Maybe she should try doing country?
❤❤
Nope
It’s not just a country album it’s got hints of RnB in it too.
TEXAS HOLD ‘EM - is the first introduction we got to receive from this masterpiece that was to come and it’s “sweet redemption”!   ——signed off by a #Beyhive member of 20+ years.🤠
errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
i don't get it LOL
Texas porque por ahi pasa el centro  del eclipse 8/4/24
😍
❤
The video is cheap. Could have done better
This video is not country. A woman exposing her breast that is not country..
Smoking hot 🔥🥵
That isn't double sided tape, that's a breastplate with a vest glued on.
You are my favorite BADASS! You go Bee!
Canzone brutta
Disgusting
Bro she is showing her boobs
I'm very late to this party, but tbh..this is the only Beyonce song I'd listen to.
WTF is this,.. this ain't country
Am I the only one that’s beeen seeing all these verizon ads before all Beyoncé songs come on genius marketing skills!
Wow the effort in the videoclip is oustanding
I miss the times when it was about the music and the videos were interesting and told a story. The music is good, the video a fashion show that doesn't match the lyrics at all. Not my cup of tea.
That's not a county video
Beyonce: this ain't Texas  Me: this ain't country
If this was an artist's first song... no one would play it. It's a poor excuse for a country song !
Satanistics welcome!
How’s that puff daddy stuff going for you and Jay Z 😂😂😂😂 EXPOSED . GOD BLESS KAT WILLIAMS
Texas hold them immigrants!
All these poor suckers who actually believe this is actually Beyonce! Just like the mainstream media News... it is all LIES and comms!
Beyonce, please keep your trashy "hoe-down" values out of country music. Get dressed!
Is this supposed to make sense
😂😂
hey porn with  country  melodies and redbone don't get any better 😂
Beyonce is the best bro
Like this comment if you know this album is trash. Let’s defeat the fake bots and fake press.
I find it awful that there are people who dare to say that the style you have... belongs to white people! It's scandalous to still see racism in 2024! Keep doing what you're doing, you're the best! ❤
I promise I'm not criticizing Beyonce & this music video of hers. I wana say that 1st. Now for what I wana say. Beyonce is great at singing & always will be & was also great here too, but she didn't wear a country style cowboy hat & I didn't hear a country accent twang in her voice in this song here. The hat & the country twang accent are a part of what makes a person a country singer. Along with being born & raised in a country type state &/or town & having a country accent. I'll admit I haven't heard Beyonce talk enough to tell if she has a little bit or a lot of country in her accent. I don't hear it in her voice in any of her songs. And so I don't see this as country music. But I think she still did great here & I promise I'm not criticizing her. I'm only sharing what I saw & heard from my observation of watching this music video.
This has nothing to do with country music
God this garbage
Not the video I expected for this song. Very disappointing!!!!!!!!
This song reminds me of John Mayer’s Wildfire
Horrible this song is absolutely horrible. She needs to get her own style instead of copying off of other people. This is just straight trash.
fuck this song
Beyonce....got....bigger
Well shit, I guess I'm a beyonce fan now, this is incredible
I see only😮
Is this getting air play with the lyrics as they are?
She should be ashamed of herself.
Beautiful song 🥰. Right on time in this chaotic world. Time to enjoy life ♥️
Stupidest Video of 2024☑️ Most obnoxious song of 2024☑️☑️
❤❤❤❤
She needs to quit worrying about trying to make country music and get that husband and hers under control, you know how many times leaves on Epstein's island, so she's married to a pedophile. She better watch her children, and was best friends with p Diddy?
Thank you Queen B❤️❤️❤️❤️⭐️💌
A song without vocal acrobatic session. About time, it sounds so much better
Ooo first time
What are you wearing??? Buy a mirror stop letting people tell you you look good. You got money they lie.
What a time to be alive ❤
This song has been on repeat in my head for weeks and I only just found out it's by Beyoncé
yall lying in these comments, this song sooo trash. BEYONCÉ? how much they pay you for this 😂
Is the video stuck ????? Wth ??? Over n over 🙄😒🙄
😂 this video could have been so much better … kinda disappointed
I just noticed h() can't play 🎸 she lien yaw 💀🖕🏽 that wobbly bodied flawjer wif bat hair 💀🤣😭😭😭
This is complete garbage..
Like Beyoncé.  Like the song.  The video is a waste.
❤❤❤
This song is not good ya shouldn't sing country it's trash
Me and Beyonće have the same birthday 🎉 ❤ 0:18
Beyonc
boring she doing same thing over and over.....at least jay lo dances
@it's_Kro_kro 🎉
When a grown women has completely sold out and is grasping to stay relevant, it’s quite pathetic in my opinion. She’s gotta be half naked just to get views cause even she knows the song is straight garbage.
What we have here is failure to Communicate
Booooo! This song sucks big time!! 😂 😂 😂 She needs to stick with R&B and leave the country music to Shania Twain and Fiona Apple and etc..
so what the hell is this besides a half naked woman
I only like 1 beyonce song and cant stand country but im just repeating... Dont be a b$%& I should try something new
This song ain't country u can't throw a couple banjos in ur song and call it country
Adorei a música e corri pra ver o clipe kkkkkkkkkk 😮
That don’t sound country.
Really?
Strut around in your underwear Yeah that's Real Country.  God this is Sh"t!
Lmaooo gotta be like the new generation of rap and show off your body 😂 easy views
Gawd how I hate new country.  Anyone who likes it was raised wrong.
Looks like the vinyl release is a steaming mess. Tracks missing, different title on the spine and label, plain inner and no credits. Beonsy thanks you for your money.
O-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d and her husband is on the down low with Puffy Pedo Diddler
Cultural appropriation at its finest 😆
Bet her kids are proud of her in that outfit (if you wanna call it one). Seriously though, why do women in pop bother wearing ANYthing at all these days...? 🤔
This video sucks what a fucking mochery
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵🥵🥵🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤠
I LIKE THIS HIHI 🌹😍🤩🏴‍☠️❤️
🔥 🥵
C'est des beau nichon ça hummm
Moi qui était septique sur la thématique du country,  je suis en kiff !!! ♡
She must have felt very triggered by Taylor Swift  all those news about her breaking 4 bilinon $ world  record must have left Beyonce feelng shabby and  worthless-
I threw up when I saw heard this.  She ain't country never will be.  She ghetto angel.
This is absolutely garbage 😂😂😂😂
Pls delete this I see this everyday everywhere
Sickening to me. Not even a music video. Just a show off my body video. Just totally DUMB
I didn't like before..and this video convinces me I hate her..go put that insulting body in a bag..thats disgusting..and what sort of image is it sending to the youth of today?..not only is the song rubbish..but it is not attractive at ALL!!!
Love this song think i am only male in these comments 😂
Quite possibly the worst song ever made.  Well done  Body is banging though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ03lzz0xjk
No tits!
What is she a borg??
Why you sing about my ex gf? This song got a bit but this is what Country is: https://youtu.be/ZdKzbF7j4Zg?si=m8N9qZQZbv0fTvrw
What a banger!
Gawd awful…..Pasty Cline,Kitty Wells,Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette are rolling in their grave….
AYOOO Y IS HER TINGE OUT
When you ask ChatGPT to write your songs.
Bro this is ass give me some Waylon or Willie or something else 😭😭
Terrible video?!

That body tho ❤❤❤
Wow
Tracy Chapmannnnn im sorry for this 😔
Beyoncé
There's a tornado in my t.....sorry I meant CITY..
The album is out! W! 🤠 😄👏🏾
Song is not bad, her voice though is grating on the nerves. So now she is annoying in two genres.
Absolutely love this song. Don’t be a bitch come take it to the floor ❤❤❤❤
I think this is my 2 fav song... even thought i dont even live in texas
Gogo
J'avoue que ce son est extraordinaire 🙅🏽‍♀️🎵💃🏼
Terrible, she's out of her lane. Not country at all.  Cheaply made video, she'll never catch Taylor Swift in performance  or looks or money.
Mocking country.
Gimme them
People be hating, but I'm totes vibing to this
Wow!! 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ay so is her husband part of the sex trafficking too ?
Really awful video. I like the song though

The tour is going to go so crazy 🐝
I waited all my life for this
Why is beyonce singing country😭 (Ik someone already commented but my god)

Try and find a video on YT that doesn't have this song playing in the background.  Go ahead.  I dare ya.
Nah
What in the world is the point of this being played on loop for the entire song?
She's not country very tacky 1st thing no country singer who ever dress so trashy no class
WE GONNA HOLD TEXAS WITH THIS ONE🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🔥🔥
No Beyoncé was harmed in the making of this AI.
Who's noticing that hand signal? ❤
Deep lyrics.. 😂
Where has her clothes gone
People in 2024 i think U rock beyoncé People who loves beyoncé and in 2024 👇🏻😝🖇⚡️
She definitely bleached her skin she used to be sexy brown now she lighter and lighter each Grammy 😂
I wonder if you all are seeing what I'm seeing in this video? Beyoce is slacking in the top ten. I'll tell you why, she's about to bring out a new album, so she's creating some dust.
It Sucks
😂😂😂🗑🗑🗑
What's up with the trashy outfit.
Sexualising C&W with a voice not suited to this type of music
I don't think Hank did it this way
Love you beyonce
Gross
What she's  wearing is gross....
Amazing how cinematography can make everything look perfect! Love this. 🤠
she's such a sweet heart and beautiful and classy and smart and worth every penny she has and more ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Pretty bad video
Ok, not bad. I love her alto. Like to see her do a dance to this on the floor. & people from Texas won't be parkin their Lexus! 😂
I love me some country music and I don’t understand the hate for this song from other country music fans. I turn this up EVERY time it’s on the radio. Get it, girl! Love it!
I😅😂❤❤Love this song

She could never be a cowboy
This interlude makes a lot of sense. Now the rhythm is changing in the album

Another disappointment.
A.Eye...the future...
The music : 😊 The clip: ☠
Now that would make a great Super Bowl half time show. Taylor Swift got nothing on that girl.
Dislike  fuck video fuck songs
As a Texan  I do not approve of this message.
They say if you ain't got nothing nice to say don't say anything at all
What is up with this video the song is not bad not country but not bad but the video is terrible
Put some clothes on you just came out the door and act like it was all fine enough and you just sing the whole song like you don’t have clothes on and you’re not naked
U have my name in ur song
silikon autotune commercial
cynical crap opinion
How is this good music? Like brub, this isn't even good
I'm not a "country fan" but lm enjoying this, but the girl needs to work on producing a more relevant video.
Other then she needs some cloths on, good song.
Not impressed with the video!
🎉
Wackkk this sht aint country
Why would that skanky outfit represent country ? Not starting an argument- just an opinion. Song is great but try to be as naked as you can without being naked Husband said something I won’t print as even I was offended. Now go post your own comments. Everyone is entitled to an opinion as long as h as it’s (husband) not (husband) derogatory. (Husband) 😅
Stay the hell out of country music
She literally made this from the Franklin theme song
Great video 😊
Ain’t a country music fan nor Beyonće (no shade to either just not my taste) yet here I am hitting repeat and ready to dance
Clip tres original 😂beyonce on the top
do you mean to tell me that Beyoncé thanks that she is talented she can come up into country with all the successful white talented country singers and try to steal their shine and all the bogus people out there who want to say that she is better than actual country singers who by the way had to work their ass off to get to where they're at today get real and by the way it was white people who created country music sick of all y'all black people and other uneducated woke liberal leftist I want to lie and say that and  say that white people didn't create country music

Song is cool but dam that is the stupidest  video I have ever seen. Lol wow lol
That is, by far, the most boring video I've ever watched. Beyonce showing off her boob job. Woo, hoo. Give the girl a round of applause 👏👏👏👏👏👏
5 for 5 ❤
Hot mess
worst song ive ever heard
Love this ❤️ pay no mind to the hate. Artists keep making art. If you feel it, make it. Genres are general classifications, not chains.
Pop trash. Where is the talent?
This is hard yonce ❤❤❤❤
Nothing close it country pos song
#beyonceishotlikeherboobs
I LOVE  THIS SONG SO MUCH AAAAAA  I AM   ADICKDID  TO THIS SONG  😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😋😋😋😋😋😋😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can't stop listening this music.😊
Why she is naked? Does she need this?
Your not even near country. Stinks
Horrible song. This is more Disney than country
Terrible song
Why she s still speaking???? 😂😂 cringe artist
Beyonce is as fake as they come. A carpetbagger in any genre. This is nothing but country music affectation, with not a spec of anything genuine.
Very cool
Love it 😍❤ ❤❤❤
Half cowboy
Such a Bad Song idk why it’s so popular. Just because she has a name doesn’t mean everything she does is good…
Lyrics are awful except first eight words.. IMO, her attempts at Country didn’t go well. On the latest, if I were McCartney, Dolly, etc. , would not have allowed her rights to use original songs… Not very good.
I’m sure that basement she talkin bout is what her and jay z have accumulated from Jeffrey Epstein 😂😂😂
I am sorry but this is not country. This pop music If you want to listen to country music, listen to Tim McGraw.
Wow……Cardi has everybody naked……the most effective and prolific video artist in the naked video genre and in the fashion industry…..not bad for a stripper…..got Beyoncé following the ratings and I love the song…..I love the hook……this ain’t Texas ain’t no holdem….
This isnt Texas, but it sure is Hell.
Not really my cup of tea but I love you  Beyoncé
As a country fan!!! We welcome the queen!!!! 👑👑👑 ❤❤❤ She's so beautiful and so talented!!!! I hope she does more !!!!
That's it come on she should of at least dance
Absolute trash.
Wtf is this video 🤢🤮
Bro 😢 is she a girl or boy like WTH
I’m sure her father is proud of her wearing that outfit.
What's country about this song
This ain't country. This is shit. I love Beyonce but this is awfully disappointing.
That's Fishbone Endless Saturday.
Oh yeah, I dig the album for you brothers and sisters who are virgin to it and get a little Endless Saturday (Fishbone). Tell me if Fishbone doesn't make you want a
This is the most stupid video I have seen in my entire life!
Love the rhythm to the song, but this video is boring as hell. Dang!
It's a R and B contemporary Country Album. The Ensemble of Musicians made Country. She Gave Soul. Yeah it's Good.
I lost all my respect for her..... She is getting naked her music is shit
Beyonce  u is not a country singer u tried
Why are these celebrities always thinking that it's okay to ruin what is not meant for them. You don't see female country artists tramping around half naked. 😐🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 You are no country artist stick to R&B
Beuncě? Bull shit. Im 59 and seen a lot of changes in country music but Beyoncé?  If it is. This is her best dong ever...even if it jer worsy bideo ever. 😂
Lava floor
Fake country.
Beyoncé is a Star Trek Borg.
It's just a vulgar and distorted trend.
Horrible song.
More trust is in her jacket then me with a knife 😭     You’ll never know what I actually said
It's like Beyonce and Taylor Swift switched places, lol.
Is that real? Or I am just dreamming? Is it organiz? You know what I mean….🎉
Beyonce needs to do Devil went down to Georgia
Where is ur shirt lady?
I think there would have been less resistance from some folks if like Lionel Ritchie, she would have released some POPULAR country songs on past albums or have it as part of a soundtrack to a western before releasing this song and album.
❤❤Love it...💋💋
This is so offense to all country people and artists. I don't think you understand what being country is. Missed it by 1,000 miles. How about start with modesty.
the lazy clip ever
Foxxy Cleopatra
Is this actually Beonce
She Looks Like the Most sexy Terminator. Go girl Go. Make History right
❤🎉❤
Trop cool
disgusting as a mother you should be ashamed
I’m conflicted but this is a banger. All the cowboys on broadway about to show they’re ass
This is what's wrong with country music.
this is shit
Looks like she dressed for a ho down.  😅😅😅 Dolly she is not.
sss
Que porquería!!!! La verdad, pésimo!
Why naked all the time
Why did Jay-Z abandon Rock music?
Amo
Fire
Her transformation to a white woman is complete.
These all gotta be bots cause ain’t no anybody like this song unless your just 🍆riding
“Park your lexus” woman I can’t even afford a 300000 mile 2006 honda civic😂
Who is she
I think everyone watches this song for you know😏       👉👅👉👌😳🥵🥵🥵
What if the vest falls off
🤍🕊️🤍 YES! Terrific!
Why does she have to be practically naked?  Love the song but seriously?!
This is considered country? Music video ain't country
Country has sold out.
You are great at pop but bad at country please you sound nothing like country
Why are you trying to be country you are sooo good at pop and you are bad at country you are only singing for more followers and it is annoying
This is one of the dumbest songs ever made.
👎
I did listen to the album it’s good
What does this video have to do with the song?
Cadê os brasileiros fãs da rainha 🇧🇷
New face of country music!!! Love it!!
I am a true Texan....and this is AIN'T Texas or Country.
I’m sorry that you’ve been getting all of these hate comments
Fake
Divina❤
Nice song, pointlessly oversexualized video
This ain't country!
Smoke hour into this song was genius!!!!!
First time hearing.. that’s it? Just Beyoncé doing what countless have done before? No innovation?
I was hoping to hear some Beyonce Texas Hold Em in the background...
25 million views! ✔️
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has moved back up to #3 on iTunes US! Keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms!
You better put something on because I ain’t gonna listen to this if you gonna just suck that
RIP Country Music.
Honestly this song sucks so much what is wrong with America or this world it’s so out of touch it’s insane I’m gonna a
I love it 💗

Garbage!!!!!!!
This shit sucks dog lol sounds like ai. Deffo doesn't sound alike Beyonce. Y'all are sheep, she clearly just tryna appeal to the south with a song about Texas, with some southern flair in there. Shit is lame.
So inappropriate 😮
Great album! Shame the Carter Family wasn’t involved somehow with a song or even a member of the family like Carlene Carter taking part.
Disappointing The Carter Family have no mention or part in this album at all.
Y’all I played this in the car with my dad cuz he likes country bro he  doesnt know it’s Beyoncé
🎶These titties, Texas.. my vest don’t hold ‘em.. 🎶
Yaw’ll must like this just because it’s Beyoncé but this is trash !
Scrolling comments while I listen. Good song, dumb video.
The video is so ew. The music is  pretty good though
The  Best ❤👏🏻👏🏻
This sounds like 90’s country hee haw music you square dance to. Dear Beyoncé please stop.
Worst song I’ve ever heard.
Sorry music sucks...
What video
that woman is perfection 👌
Beyonce, you not country, quit it.
Song✅ outfit❌
Why am I watching a loop rn 💀
Is this even called a video??? Waste of our 3mins of our lives watching a 10aec action repeatedly. 😮
Why is she wearing that thing on her face and shooting out of her finger after she fondles herself? She reminds me of the terminator but female .????
Love it.
This video is stupid.
She is so pretty Edit : and ofc the outdit
I dont get the video but I love the music ❤❤❤❤
🪩.QUEEN RAH DIGGAH YOU TOO.KING EBONY AND QUEEN BEYONCE ARE NUMBER ONE.
First when I heard this, I thought it was the Scissors Sisters and that the singer's voice mutated.
Country? Where?
Gotta play rdr2 listening to this album
She shows a lot ofskin
Beyonce and Country music, and this dress... Embarrassing
24 912 900  views in 1 month? wow!   *46000th comment btw
She ain't got no nipppllleessss
She needs to stop listening to people that are blowing smoke up her ass
This is horrible
This is so bad it’s sad
This is so horrible 😂😂😂this is definitely culture appropriation
A.B.C-Z(えーびーしーずぃー)の 戸塚祥太さんがXにURL載せていたので 聴きに来ました。 テンションが上がる曲なので 仕事のときに聴けば 仕事の効率が上がる気がします。 いろんなかたに この曲をオススメしたいです。
She s loud and proud of those things 😂
❤❤❤❤❤
Well let’s go to the strip club guys. If we sing country in TEXAS; we keep tradition. Shame on you. Turn me off from the start but song seems good. I just can’t get past the upper vest.
This is the most boring video ever. I could have made it using images found on the Internet. I wasn't sure this was really an official video. Song is ok tho.
Country girls don't dress like hos what a tragic attempt to do country
She needs to work on this album another 5 years, it doesn’t sound like country, it sounds like a Saturday night live spoof. The whole album is confused and reaching for something it’s not let’s just be honest she’s great the album is painful to hear.
I'm sorry, but she is not a Country Singer. She is pretty and talented, just not a country singer. Taylor made a concert documentary, wow, what a surprise, Beyonce then made one. Now she is singing country (not really) . Taylor started in Country. This is all about competition or possibly jealousy.
This is not country music
Nice
Hillbilly song
Sorry Charlie..... one of her most boring videos ever
i would try to keep that vest one for my life.....
J'aime ❤
Beyoncé, The Queen !!!
امروز عکس شوهرت رو دیدم خیلی تعجب کردم حالم به هم خورد چقدر زشت بود متنفر شدم از انتخاب تو چقدر بد سلیقه هستی 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
People forget that she grew up in SAM Houston town. As Texas as it gets.
من خوش تیپ و جذاب هستم مدل هستم با من ازدواج میکنی
من فرانسه زندگی میکنم میخام باهاش ازدواج کنم ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beyonce  you are so interesting
Red Dead Redemption 3
Came here just to dislike this garbage
Breast Implants.
❤l love❤you❤MARIJA I love you guys❤CVITA❤l love❤you❤
She can't do it anymore in her style of music so she has to invade country and whore it up.
Why the f*** do you need to be naked for country music too?
Sounds is OK, but the video is horrible.
2024 worst video and song of the year congrats
Wie komt uit Nederlandof belgie?
Produced by diddy jay z and r kelly lovely
FEET
Oldie here…What is on Beyoncé’s face?
Sorry too many crotches for my country music taste...that's more for hip hop..too distracting from the song..tunes catchy though..keep the videos less crotch and bum for country..
Chouette chanson. Par contre elle a besoin de se foutre à moitié à poil . 😂😂
I NEVER KNEW HOW GOOD HER SONGS WERE WTH—WE MAKING IT OUT THE COUNTRY WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
Very creative video 👏
The barn i herd farm plant groom tease bath wishing well hey stack...honey bunches of....good-bad UGLY🇧🇧
Hey it's Franklin 😮
What am i watching over and over again?
Nice voice❤
not a single playing card in the video just half naked and a walking motion on loop trying to sell those curves.
Beyonce has such beautiful, natural tone to her voice that I’m not even slightly surprised that it would be suited to Country and, possibly, more genres of music. Cool song btw.❤
this is no different than black face.
🦧
Me
Couldn’t be tailor so she stopped at country light lol it’s woke come on lol 😂
Me temblaron los calzones con este rolon
👇 if she needs clothes on🙈
Garbage
Anyone else thinks this music video is crap?
this aint texas woohnyeah
This song does  not give me country vibes it gives me very much Georgia swamp bar vibes I'm sry she ain't country ill pass
What’s with this lame video? Is this the real video? It’s nothing
YES BEYONCE!!!
Wow, what a body. I’m a female and I’m in awe. You go girl!!
It's so nice to see a black artist making country music to take ir back to black people así they invented it and White people stole it.  But Beyoncé, if you care about black people, why does tour clothing brand (Ivy Park) is made with slave labour in África? Those black people don't count?
24/7🎉❤
rhshuidgwk7🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳
“This ain’t Texas” yeah no shit, you can’t sing.
This is the cheesiest song ever. Sounds amateur at best
Da fck? Disaster.
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
POV : We all came from tiktok 👇
Franklin themed song hehe
Put some clothes on and clean up yur heart. You are sadly sickening 😖
Song is shit
Ass
✨
Das Lied morgens zum Kaffee und der Tag ist gerettet 🫶🏻
Ped○rr○ vídeo = n@rc○
Man its almost like country is the easiest shit to make
Sooo why bother with leather duster? The only thing we CAN’T see is nips! 😂
I think this is ALOT  !  And definitely NOT COUNTRY.  And although she looks amazing, this is NOT what country fans are inspired by or looking for.
She is a Kyrie Fan F it
This is one of the worst songs I've ever heard.
Composers are still pending, however, I sense Sadiiq Raphael has some influence on the this phenomenal piece. Beyoncé the queen of Melodies
Is this a joke ?
Um I stopped watching after the 4th time she walked forward and shot from her fingers. Is that the entire video? 🤷‍♀️
she destroying CoUNTRY with BEING ALMOST NAKED, and im a black woman . dont change country MUSIC
POV: old men 😳🤭💕
Beyoncé being country wow
In Norwegian if we say it's "Texas" it means it's really wild 😅
I’m not a big fan but I like her country music!
This video sucks!! I’m sorry you don’t know how to be country. 🤣😂 you better get a better dance choreographer
What???
I'm sorry but In my opinion that is not true country music I apologize.
I really didn't need another reason to love this woman. Thank you anyway.
Like the song but the video sucks!
Please put some clothes on!
Like song.... video doesn't match.
I came after see dance Lavbbe
💜💜💜💜💜
So!!!!  There are no words to respond for 0:30 . That’s about the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. And I believe you think Jelly Roll is country!!!  That’s why your response to me is absolutely about the most stupidest thing I have ever heard anyone say!!!!
Annoying
No
Garbage 🗑️
Ugh
This how us homies do it in the barrio https://youtube.com/shorts/huwSVzhm2XY?si=4uZ4KXqBOfcOcX0w
Queen!!!
I love this song! She have a great talent for country music!!! 🤠😊
🎉🎉❤❤
She’s putting more trust in that vest then i have in god
First of all, as much as I LOVE it, just like beloved Taylor Smith, it ain't Country! It's sooooo good and it's soooo meaningful, but please, this AIN'T Country!
I love this song and I'm glad she is wearing everything she wants. Surprised for her new album, sounds so good.
Cuntry
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙄
SO MANY VIEWS IN ONE MONTH😮
What
Stripper cowboy music
I dont know.....
I don’t care what you say, this sucks and it’s definitely not country music. Check out Aaron Lewis if you wanna hear something good! FJB!!
Straight represent
That's a video?
Now, this I really like. More county sound. Her voice is so distinctive to hip hop R&B that it's hard not to hear that when she sings. But I love it.
Is this the whole video? Lol
It's well done; although. it inappropriate.  Can do without the cursing.  Coutry music should be for all ages and she wants to use bad words?  Naa.  She still sounds a little too R&B with a country beat!  Lol...
Me i am hot for a perform tonight and all the time with she😂😂😂❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 Good night angel
This video is  trash! If the idea is to take over country you better get some twang in that vocal! Funny they dont' show you the dislikes...typical!
🫵🫵👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️🙌🙌🙌
My cat decided we needed to hear this again 😂
No....just no
This song is the best 🎉
𝖎 can see why people like this song but lets not try to pretend that this is country, this song is the furthest thing from country music
You have to give it to Beyonce's team.. They know how to keep her in the mainstream.
With that being Beyoncé you would  think the music video would be amazing At least some dancing
Not country
Ok no hate, but like just cuz ur singing about texas and stuff does not mean its country music. This is not really country, and way more of pop....
Ridiculous....what is country about that... it's just her in love with herself ...
super boring video\ like the song
I am a woman and can gonedtly say I am not shirtless all the time. I din't thinkbyou would like it
🔥🪩🔥
Song is great , video not so ? What is the go with the video on repeat - disappointing
That ain't country
Puke! The biggest slap in the face one could ever do to country music. Stay in your lane Beyonće. 🤦🏻‍♀️
This song is overated
She isn't welcome in country music stop trying to be country
So here for this ❤🎉
El video es malo no tiene nada de texas
I haven't listened to her since Destiny's child I hate videos I love singing but no need to bash her she's rich and don't care what we think I know I wouldn't
I did not know this was country song.  I don't recogise new country as country at all.  But seeing it has 45K+ comments.  I know what is being said and thought by all sides of this.  The meltdowns in here and during the game had to have been COLOSSAL.  We've really become something I tell you.  I guess her having a singing entertaining CAREER and making MONEY still isn't good enough.  I'd bet $100.00 CAD that four letter "W" word is down there somewhere.  I can go on to my radio repair video.  I just want to point out that the other country artists are incorporating her other musical style and bass into the current country style along with screamo.  I don't see what the fuss is about.  Keep the aspirin factories a workin'  😆   Time for some unsolicited advice:  Life's too short guys... Way too short.
My mom doesn’t like this
Where is the Country in her voice???Still sound R&B/rap
This song makes *even more sense* with Willie Nelson giving the introduction to it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥📣📣📣📣
True she does have more country yes indeed !
Umm....  This is awesome, but I also feel like I woke up in some weird alternate universe where Beyonce is a country singer.
Yeah all you cowboys and cowgirls park your jacked up lexus…anyways
Why????? Absolutely not her best video!!!!
Listen to Molly Tuttle sing this.
Taylor swift was country she changed to pop now Beyoncé is country . Her video is silly
Now, that's a Country Song!!!
Eww. Yep, that's Beyonce. And this ain't country. I thought I was listening to a mash up!😂 nope it's her cosplaying country music. No thanks.
I can say I’m proud of her accolades, but people worship her like she’s a God
Her moves just repeat
She just cant sing period. Off tune
Terrible video and song. It's not country music lol. Keep complaining Beyonce... I'm sure that you will find a way to say everyone hates you. Your music just isn't good and never has been. She should be thankful she has even sold 1 album. Go back to riding on your hubbies coat tails. Neither of you are very talented music wise. Jay had a few great songs when he started and everything since then has been garbage.
Never understood why people like Beyonce
Meh, not a very good song.  Doesn't even sound like a country song.  False advertising, what a fake!
Trying to keep up with Taylor swift 😂
Wtf
The song is great - Video, not so much.
😂 not country just because you're from Texas and sing about a horse.
Back to our original music we created! Get job
what crap .
UHHHH....
Hootie didn't have a problem going from rockto country!!   Being a Luminatie doesn't help. That's devils gang.  So sorry I don't care and why do you all  make a big deal. Help your people in the ghetto that need help.
So confused by this video.
Fan fact: MTV censored her breasts cleavage although nothing explicit is shown. WTF?
Why is the playlist all out of whack?
The best!!!!!!
Yeah, but don't objectify her. Beyonce is a hypocrite.
An actual video would’ve been nice. Yawn!
Is that all she does!? 😮
This ain’t real country
Where is your clothes 😮😮
Anyone who enjoys this and thinks this is country your funny 😂
This is not ok
She needs to put some clothes on!   I can't let my kids watch this.
😂😂😂😂😂 no thanks
Saying Beyonce’ is country is like saying Jelly Roll is too. How many times can you say the same line over and over.
downfall of country
Música tão legal e o clipe fica como: uma bosta 😅
If she thinks being half naked in the video is what country is then need to go back and learn a few things
Very creative, she's showing her mammary glands and saying the slang word for "bonk" and bringing a little American ghetto nuance into the western genre by talking about a Lexus. Well, what's next for Beyonce? Maybe she could do chinese opera playing an amplified Guqin and get her eyelids redone.
Diddy supporter
This sounds horrible. Its not country, we dont accept her.
💣🤍💯
Was B always this white 🤍
Truly s waste of time... So so bad....😢
🤮🤮
Imagine that jackets slips 💀💀
Nice one. Isn't she brilliant.
I hate this song so much
why is "my house" not on the album???
Don’t like that song. I believe because it’s Beyoncé, that’s why everyone like the stupid song.  Beyoncé should’ve tried singing some SOCA, or Hooking up with Destra Garcia. I know she wouldn’t go wrong… but country? I hate that dump song.
now i want a lexus for some reason beyonce whyyyyy!
the gun shooting everytime seems like " let's get em keep hating hehehe"
Why are you naked that is appropriate it's a baby appropriate
Why do all these songs sound like they were recorded with technology of the seventies 😂
Nice
Me
Beyonce is a baddie
Bey!! That's a whole lotta biddy!! 🤣🤣🤣
HOW THE HELL IS POSSIBLE ONLY 25MILL VIEWS???!!!!!!
T3xas hoodlum
A terrible songs hiatus. Thank you, Ms. Giddens. The white producers only rule takes a brief plantation run.

But this is Texas…
Trans white.
Stick to lluminatti leave country alone!!!😡
Stay in your lane. Don’t insult country like this. You’re a wanna be “cow girl” and a wanna be country “artist”. This is dog water.
Sexy beautiful genius..new song to dance to in the clubs..❤💃🕺
Go Bey,  you did the damn thing with thus one. Much love
Not a bad song.
I dont understand why some of these artist who were top of their game in a Genre of music that has given them the wealth & fame to when they have a Dip in form! have to regenirate in another genre that is popular Show 90% of your Breasts with a song which is a Average song to be popular again...She will end up Like Madonna, twisted on Ego! smh
Me
right before the video started I got a add of Beyonce
Intro is from the game, Bratz babyz ponyz styling 😀
cheapest music video ever made
Terrible.
I love Beyoncé so much she is awesome
Sadly we're living in a world of Delusion, Though ,If someone else did this album other than Beyonce all will bypass,Though I have noticed music artist who can actually sing ppl pretend that they Don't hear them cuz people Hate on people who can actually sing.
Such a great song, such a distasteful video
The song's shit
Oh no… came here to check it out cuz people were talking about Beyoncé doing country. Nope.
Worst country song I’ve ever heard
I still find Shania Twain more attractive than this lady
Inappropriate alert
This whole country album sucks. Not because it’s county but because it’s Beyoncé trying to take a stab at a genre she has no business being apart of
Texas Holdem, is catchy , but stay in “your own lane “.  Your Country is just a flashy impersonation.  I understand, it’s all about reaching out to another marketing segment of listeners.  Your video kinda irritated me. Couldn’t you have worn jeans, and a Rodeo Queen type shirt. There’s lots of flash, and sparkle. I’m tired of people using the flag as a prop, to further their agenda.
this aint country
Sounds like something they would sing while digging a ditch on the chain gang
Damn… she needs to find some Jesus! What in actual fuck????
How is this country!!
Stupid video 🤮🤮🤮
She isn't even country. This is closer to pop. What a disgrace
El country es negro 💪🏿♥️✊🏿
Beyoncé is just copying Gretchen Wilson's redneck woman. The melody, the beat and the vibe of the song are exactly the same. Absolutely nothing creative about this whatsoever.
She sounds good
She totally sucks
and another trash Beyoncé song trying to be country ,  we didn't like you with the Dixie chicks and we don't  want you now
She's not country.  Move on.
Awful
She shouldve added that intro to this song
Eww 🤮🤮 is are god musik
Um no. Seriously?
Love the song. Hate the outfit.
So, is the actual video? If so, where is the rest of it?
😂😂😂 wtf is this whack ass shit
❤
Put some close on its country not a strip club what kinda of message are you sending to the young girls females need to have a little more class and not be so trashy
It is so amazing to me how black women adore this fake black woman.
That's no dolly
Whats with all the one eye symbolism
Her body is always on fleek. She’s a beautiful woman.  Naturally Beautiful to me 🤷🏽‍♀️
When I say I really like this sing 🎤 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️‼️ I don’t care 🤷🏽‍♀️ what anyone says about Beyoncé, but one ☝🏾 thing no one ☝🏾 can’t deny is this Girl been on a different level her OWN LANE ICON LEGEND A BEAUTIFUL GIFT A BOSS ALWAYS WORKING HARD HAVING HER LEGACY ALREADY ON LOCK 🔐. Super proud of Beyonce’ an her amazing accomplishments isn’t no where over yet. You go Bey 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💯💯💯💯‼️
No it’s 6 times
Me
É
Give Franklin his song back….. 🐢
Texas fuck’em!
What an embarrassment. She looks terrible
Nimic interesant, videoclip fără sens 🤷🏼
Gay song🎉🎉🎉
Flop
Interesting music 🎶 👍🏻
Great voice but clumsy lyrics.  One listen is enough for me.
Who’s here 2025?
Nenevebrh
This song is aids
Why do women always have to appear naked?
She sure didn’t put much effort into this video
🤩🤩🤩
I can’t stop listening to it 😭😭😭
why so little clothing.
Oh minha bey queria tanto aquele clip pra lacrar com tudo....😢❤ Tenho esperança 😊🎉
This is not country music
This is racist! Cultural appropriation!
Who's ready for tonight
Texas Hold Up
gente essa musica nunca é country kkk, e o cilpe repetitivo demais , poderia ser melhor
This ain’t Country music ! This IS Jungle drums beating with a Banjo somewhere in the background ! She is an embarrassment to music … stay in your own lane!
ME
The final harmonizations near the end are my favorite part
What the fuck is this, Jesus Christ 😂😂😂
cheapest clip in the world...10$ ^^
Stupid a$$ song
Fun song.  The intro sounds a little like Gretchen Wilson's Redneck women - just a little different tempo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82dDnv9zeLs
She's pretty 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Boring.....
Nothing but an over paid stripper.
Love, god
Absolute a disgrace to my ears what trash
🗣️ BEEEEEEEE
Culturally appropriation at its best; complete hypocrisy. And what's the deal w/ the $h1tty video?  Mehhyuck🤮
Ayo we know why you watchin this shit
Beyonce is one sexy milf. I can't believe in just six years Blue Ivy will be a grown woman. Following her mommas footsteps. Kudos.
Who is listening to the entire album without skipping
Help my teacher likes beyonce-
Snooze fest
So, who thought this video or even this song was a good idea? What a waste of time.
I love this song I had absolutely no idea that Beyoncé, a black woman, sang this song until my kids told me! I absolutely love it love it love! it full disclosure I didn’t like the video. Watching it once that first part which she walks out hot in that vest and shooting the gun/fingers was awesome…… it  was just lazy that you just keep the video on that loop.
🌏🌍🌎☕️💭🫶
Absolutely the worst thing my ears have ever heard, next to Lay Z. This is pop music and  a disaster to the country genre.
Not been funny or owt but this is shite
I can't take this serious. It sounds like karaoke or a meme you find generated by AI. "tHe CoWgIrL" Starter Pack. lul kek kee crica2007
Taking back everything that was ours  😢❤❤❤🎉
🤮
This absolute garbage 🤢
Que aburrido vídeo!!!!!!😒😒😒
She forgot to dress
That ain't country!!
Bonita canción pero el video muy simple.
Chili con carne!
if she was good in music she wouldn't be naked all the time..
Who let her make this terrible song?
🤦‍♂️ Sucks…
👎👎
🌷✨💗🦋💋😘 amo a esta mujer💟
This song sucks💀
Is she trying to follow Taylor Swift's success ? 🤣
No talent. Song is awful.
So now blacks introduced people to country what a joke
If it can influence black peoples to be more open minded about music then it’s positive. They’ve been robbed of all the great genres of music all for the sake of ‘It ain’t black, cool or tough’.
This is the best dance moves that I have seen to this song yet https://youtube.com/shorts/KmcuqktBvqQ?si=GQ2J2uhpaliEUW1w
Love her voice in this song but everything else in it was off putting... especially the whistling.
Me encanta ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Never squat with your spurs on
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. too bad Beyonce is broke compared to me. She could afford some better......anything
Nothing Country there.🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Garbage. 😂😂😂 Whatever makes them money.... Talk about a monotone boring song. Basic AF.
Doesn’t sound like country at all
Damn this is really horrendous af 😂. Who tf let her do this? She really don’t got it! She make black country music look and sound real bad 🤦🏽‍♂️ it was just fine without her
That's not how a cowgirl 🤠 dresses   False  presenting a cowgirl they were pants and Shirt. cowgirl 🤠 hat cowgirl boots there country  girls it's like your making  fun of cowgirl  the way you dressing in your video they don't walk around  showing there lady parts They wear beautiful dress covering up body I grew up watching Western shows with my dad You're making them look bad by dressing unappropriate on your video respect  the cowgirl  girls like your fans respect  you
Never in the history of mankind was a African-American woman born with long blonde hair this is 100% cultural appropriation and I call for an automatic boycott Plus on top of that the song sucks😂😂😂
I'm sure all country singers are blonde haired and half-naked to sing a country song right no only sleazy hip-hop artists that culturally tried to appropriate white country music are
I see the end of country music by crap like this
Tune ❤❤❤
Kylie did it first. https://youtu.be/-BDImdAfodA?si=jShVVIZM0XpxK0KK
I love her but why in the world would you look like this. Why show so much of yourself, these are your private parts. Nobody can touch them, but’s aloud to show them? Young girls will also look that way en boy’s look at her  sexually. Is that intentionally? I think I don’t understand.
Bro this is just for fan service
Jaden smith style video!!!
UNLEASHED 🤘😈🔥🪩🔥
Des ondes hyper positive se dégage de cette chanson 😮❤ je suis fan
This is not country, loved her with Destiny's child, but this reminds me of music made to make fun of country. Country has black artists, they don't care if they are No1, all she wants is attention.  The video is crap and sexualized, not Country.
Doesn't really sound country.  Her boobs sure big these days.  Compliments to her surgeon.  They bounce nice.
Stick to what you do best cause every time I hear this song I get nauseous like stfu and leave country music to the country folks getto people don’t like country music and they said so themselves so skidaddle
So much about this is not country.
Post Malone will do a better country album🔥
Darius Rucker is the blacK country artist GOAT 🐐
I don’t get the jacket tbh anyway I think she trying to compete with Taylor Swift.
Literally ruining country music.  Looking like a $2 whore…trying to step into the life of country?  First things first, woman in country absolutely don’t have to show their bodies off for fans. Because their fan base actually listens to the music and lyrics.  In all honesty I straight up search for lyrics, bc yalls videos are sad. Like y’all screaming “look at me!!”  Like stop. Just SING.  Rant over.
The ones who listend to country knows this isnt country
I m g a y
This suvk and a joke😂
Nice lyrics, great vest lousy video.
This is one boring AF music video!!!
Beyonce turned me country. 😂🤠 But I've always liked country music tho. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🐐🐐🔥🔥
I love this Song❤ but the Video 👎👎👎👎
I > > > LOVE < < < the way people who doesn't love Beyonce is here in the comments sharing hate saying this is not country song YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT YOU >>STILL<< HERE
I'm 100© gay. But damn....
Did she just copy the intro from Semsi Yastiman- Uzaylilar Hos Geldiniz?
This is trash. Way to fake country music to get sales
Oh my, this poor lady lost her eye sight, has to wear a patch.  And damn, somebody done went and stole all her clothes!!!    Ya'll think anyone should tell her that H-do went out of style about 40 years ago?
When Beck released morning phase, the whole country vibe was perfect with his voice and payed respect to the genre. This is just pop music with a different take / twist on it, wich you like or don't like. Im in the last category.
Like this song, not her exposing her uppers. Probably her man made her. She is so much more than him.
This is NOT COUNTRY!!! EXPOSURE IS NOT MUSIC. PUT SOME DAM CLOTHES ON!!!!.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 boobies
So in the 1960s The CIA was snuggling cocaine and heroin into poor disadvantaged communities on the brink of revolution to a two pronged effect. The first was to squash any possibility of a viable rebellion the second to fund covert ops against communism they couldn't ask Congress to openly fund. To launder this money they used artists like Andy Worhol who made things like paintings of soup cans. This is essentially that. This little substance I'm wondering what sins of people in high places this is covering up. Don't believe me the documents on the modern "art" operations are all declassified. Give it a peak. This is obviously a big ole look at the birdy though.
I love this for us.
This isn’t country though lol
Could we maybe have something different for a video. Lowest budget video ever
Beyoncé’s straight gangster, what a women!
un tube
omg beyonce leave country alone ....... this makes no sense ...... go back to working with lady gaga or something ....... leave country alone ..... you do not sound right at all ...... bring back the old beyonce ...... LEAVE COUNTRY ALONE PLEASE
Fuckin garbage
With the album this song got much bigger
2 words Bad Ass🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️🖤💎
This ain't fucking country
Not country
Nice
Omg that is an awful video and song!!!
SORRY........THAT'S NOT COUNTRY !👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Does she have to be pornographic to sell a great sound?
Absolute crap - no one would give a crap about her if she wasn't attractive...
Nonsense
Harika ses Türkiye'den selamlar 💫
What happened to county 😅😅😅😢
Trash!
Just mediocre -maybe suitable for an advert backing track
This music video is kinda annoying, it's the same 10s dance, repeated..
Unpopular opinion but...as much as I love her and I love country, she sucks. It's very basic, typical country. I was hoping for a little more creativity. Jolene definitely showcases her voice range a bit better though- which is beautiful!
This is not country music
Another woke
Viada, que danada você!!! E não é que ficou uma delicinha essa música. 🤩
have to admit, this beyonce s idea to make a half naked video was very brilliant and original!
Who knew she was from texas.  Not her fans, until now.  It's too commerical.  And the biggest point of all is the music is horrible.  Probably because her heart is not in it just her wallet.
Weird disconnect between the video and the song. Verdict? Song/audio  is 💯% better.
It's kinda like shes making a joke of country music not to mention Texas ... DISRESPECTING
Well I love country music, this aint country. Sorry, not sure what genre this falls into.  Not to mention she is a sex trafficking Communist
This song is such a feel good song! There is no need to hate it whether you believe it’s country or not! Just enjoy the music!
Are we this desperate for a new song or music??? Im not lol
💀 LMAO I CACKLED
Fun fact I live in Sweden and there is someone in my class named Texas and someone named lexus😂 I swear
Beautiful song ❤
COWBOY CARTER IS HERE YALL🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
La musique country ce n'est sûrement pas sa!!!!!!
Beyonce has zero credibility when it comes to authentic music.  This whole country music direction feels very insincere.  Almost like it is simply a calculated move to vacuum up more dollars from a different section of the American public.  The feeling is that she doesn't actually love or even respect the subject and the people she is singing about,  but rather flipping them off under her breath. Beyonce is to music what McDonald's is to food, over processed,  over hyped and with no nutritional value.
This is awe full
Love the song
Très bonne publicité pour les marques de pantyhose.
This gal has a good voice, but zero talent in the lyrics game. Those lyrics suck. I feel sorry for people who really know how to write that will never have their stuff heard because crap like this is clogging the airwaves.
What a shooter 🔫 on target 🎯
Tek gözünü gözümüze sokmuş gene
Wordt clip ever 😂😂
Dam the jacket
😂 + ,🔺
Hell yeah 🙌🏻 Let's dance 💃🕺
Rip perfectly fibe shies 😂
Like to hear a Shania cover of this.
Who’s here from TikTok?
Nice song but the video is naff.
Love the song. Terrible video
Who pays money to listen to this shite 😂
This isn’t country music
🇩🇿 Oooh , what a sexy country jacket. I wanna be your windy cowboy ♥️
She’s Terrible! A false prophet. A Ho of Babylon…, maybe the Ho of Mystery Babylon.!
TERRIBLE BORING VIDEO FOR THIS COOL SONG!!!😢😢😢
I love this song
amo amo queen
So glad Aretha Franklin never had to take her clothes off to sell her songs - Class is permanent, form is temporary.
Best bday to me with the release! ❤ Love it 😊
Sad this banger didn’t get a music video 😫
Beyonce really dont mind about MUSIC VIDEO???
Why so much nudity
See I heard dis I was like dis sound like Beyonce
Your song is better than the others
Get better
This is so shit
Beyonce, do better. This song is trash
✨ ÁLBUM DO ANO✨
I cant wait for jay z to go down w diddy 😅😅😅😅😅😅  this man bish willbe begging for mercy
Its   like groundhog dayu it just  keeps getting worse .  Hide minions
White washed black man ? Country  now ? Fake gun  blastin?  Odd so odd. Im puking   so is all of amerikkka
Look its a man 😅
What a shit video. Adds nothing to the pop trash song which is just racial appropriation for commercial gain.
Horrible.
If you’re Beyoncé you can tackle any genre you like. It doesn’t matter what the lyrics are providing they’re catchy and easy for the audience to sing along with. 23 million + views suggests she knows what she’s doing when it comes to engaging an audience.
Sex sells
This song is not good
At this point she just throwing the subliminal out there. Look at the way she holds that trigger hand and the one eye covered 😂. Y’all looking at someone who sold their soul  and don’t even know you are
Go Beyonce you have done it again.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG.  have not been with country for awhile for new stuff but loving the your new and with Dolly!!!!!
🤠🕺🏾
I Love This ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Why are so many and about this song? In my opinion it’s fine, it’s not your typical country but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t hate it.
esti de ta de marde je les dans tete h24 esti que tu a mal tourner
I just can't apperciate country music when your half naked.... Go back to Maddie and tae... women in country music should be more than half naked. Country music needs more Shania twains and Reba and Maddie and Tae and LeAnn rhimes
Apparently they did not go over the 100 budget for this video.
❤😊🎉🎉🎉
This song is so baddd 😭
Ain’t nothing this woman can’t do!!!!
tuve una ereccion
As someone who grew up loving country music, please don't kill it, this sounds like something off the color purple
Y’all really like anything she does this isn’t good.  Gosh I don’t like everything my favorite people do please stop hyping it up cause she’s Beyoncé
Beyonce use the line dancers in your video make s more exciting
WTF! LMFAO 😂😂😂
Legit.
Que tudoooo 🇧🇷🇧🇷🐝🤠, vc no meu coração 💕🔫 !
Is this the woman who is supposed to be a role model to young girls but is widely known to wear real fur and exotic animal skins, what a joke!
🫶🏾✨🥂
So basically be practically nude and say you are a country singer? NO THANKS!
😂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️❤❤
Not all the angry people here right now 😂
Very REPETITIVE
Te amo ❤
WHOS HERE?
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Trop sexy ❤😂🎉un peu osé 😅la tenue
🤮
SHAME ON YOU....... PRISON 😂❤ WHERE IS OPRAH.PERVERTS
ME THINKS BEYONCE IS PISSED WITH TAYLOR SWIFT GETTING ALL THE HEADLINES......AFTER LISTENING TO THIS DRIVEL TAYLOR HAS NOTHING TO  BE WORRIED BOUT!!!
Watching Beyoncé be so embodied and confidently sexy makes me proud to be a woman. I love seeing a beautiful woman shine onto others and make them feel more confident not less. Can’t wait till midnight!
Me jumping to this after Willie Nelson’s smoke hour interlude
This ain't country and she ain't Texas
Queroooo mais músicas 🎶 genteeeeeeee socorro 😊😊😊
I love this song  🤠
Couldn't  wait
She killed Aaliyah ?
Hahaha😂
Texas, eat you heart out! Yihaaa
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
POV: im the jacket 🧥 Do you really trust me?
How TF is this country geez slap on a hat and say Texas is country no way no anyhow stick to what you know country music is a life story not some game look Hank Williams Johny Cash or Hank Snow or Hager and Jerry read real country not some city crap.
NO HATE I LOVE BEYONCÉ BUT I DONT LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC SHE SINGS IT AMAZING THO🤭
Who is here after the album???
Yuck, what a disgustingly ugly video… country is NOT her thing!!!😖
For all those rolling their rednecks eyes at her.
Boooooo!!!! She sucks 😂
My teacher actually played this in class 😭
Can you do one song without your titties hanging out
I vividly am imagining 5 caked up cowboys in a bar throwing it back for this whole song
LOVE YOU BEYONCÉ
What this song is trash what the heck you guys idiots
theres no emotions.  no energy. nothing...  the song sounds of energy...  wtf???   u take her song halo or all the pretty ladies and compare it to this garbage and you can see .... wtf is this garbage ? u think bc of yoour name beyonce u can put anything out there?  before when ur making halo and the other songs in that era you made with the notion u wanted to be great...  ur not great now
Embarrassing
Song is good. Video is a disappointment.
BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, what a joke...... this ain't country, this is trying to gain more in another genre.....
Thanks for posting
At this point she should just be shirtless
well good song...but country music is about good music but not about naked people...grandma and pa would never liked it. and the old school is the best school!!   Dress accordingly ...just saying....not about the music or black or white....just wear some clothes! thats the only problem i see....not black or white  like they are sayin....it is to me...just wear some clothes!!!do not need to see skin to like a song, or twerking and half naked dancers!! Again ...song is great, but video ...no!  just sayin...
Country music has gone naked too?😮
No comments
Culture vulture.
Lame video.
Love ❤️
Slayyyyyyyy Queen 👑❤️
A disgrace to the Country scene. Put on some clothes!
Woo woo woo,,, it's like someone broke wind.
Wow my favourite artist❤🥰
Gorgeous as usual.
Te juro que escuché esto hace un año…,por qué esta canción es reciente?
https://youtu.be/S3DlpcqWBHQ?si=7AQcsiGM_hV9cXKR

As a person from the south this song is not real country just because she is from Texas doesn’t mean that the song or her is country people like Morgan wallen Dolly Parton and others like them are real country singers so quite saying you listen to country music when the country song is this
Who told blud to sing country 💀💀💀
crap
IM SICK OF THIS SONG. Please stop playing that garbage
Yoncé4Eva💕
Is this a Lexus advert
imagine this song been sung by janis joplin...what an honor this would be!  heard this song today for the first time...loved it immediately!   you go, girl!
At 2:00 p.m. I've been hearing that there's going to be a new album😊😢🎉
🪩
Is there any genre can't fit in? She's MUSIC!!!
Wish she was doing anything other than pretending to shoot in this “video” 😢
Who’s ready for tonight’s performance!”
So fuckin bad
Bruh what’s under that jacket no shirt lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Damn
I didn't think she needed to throw the curse words in there,  but it's a very catchy tune
i am not a fan of Beyonce my family hates her, but this song is good.
Jesus Christ
Good good stuff. The critics can take a long walk off a short stage
Not much into Beyonce. Great song, so no need to hang out the hooters. I was hoping to see her actually singing the song. Makes me doubt she's the one who recorded the song.😢
Beyonce has become a very popular porn star. She also has a good voice.
This is the worst ‘song’ that has ever happened. It’s in the running for the worst sound that has ever happened too.
Next grammys are All yours Baby ❤🎉
She’s giving 7 of 9 realness
ok so everybody is alright with the unnecessary nudity? i feel it's too much and kinda disrespectful to the original creator of the song, but whatever makes u sell it girl, u already sold yourself anyway ./
what if this was made by ai
What a joke
Album of the yar is out now let's go❤
Guyssss the album is out let's gooooo
OMG the album is out❤️
Karma is real yea…    But your the one who’s gonna get it😭😭
Garbage
🚮
Imagine ripping off Franklin the Turtle 🤡
Love it. Music is music....everyone chill tf out.
I love you ❤️💕😘 ❤
👑 Kenyans any one
Gone are the days of maxi dresses .😮
Cheapest video ever made
Beyoncé hey
Los blancos no superan el contry de  una mujer de color ❤
This is a Cash grab for folks who are too gullible. Be smarter. Trash music is trash music.
Lol this sucks

What in the country sh*t is this???
Honestly don't know why people think she's talented one of the worst musicians of all time
This is fuckin stupid
She killed it..
Here before 25m Klicks
very disconcerting, what a horrible example to young girls everywhere who follow her music as if being half naked has any artistic value.  No moral value whatsoever for sure.  I actually liked the song until I saw this.  I know its not a formal video but still very bad on its own. sad sad sad
such an ass song she just needs to retire
As good as any pop country, I guess
I can't wait to hear the whole album!! 🥰
Pfffffft THERE AINT NO DAMN TORNADOS IN HOUSTON.  AND SHE DEFINITELY DONT KNOW ANY SLOW DANCES.  JUST CUZ UR SKIN WENT LIGHT DONT MAKE U COUNTRY.
Ghetto Country Music
Bieda w Ameryce,  gwiazda nie ma się w co ubrać
Don't like it. Doesn't even sound like 'country'. Don't like what she's wearing either....so unnecessary.
I like the song too!  She does have trust in that leather: LAWD HAVE MERRRRRRRRRRSAY! 🤯
Los puristas del country tan cabreaos como los puristas del flamenco 😀
You can just tell that Jay Z helped produce because of that beat in the background. I'm wondering if she tried to do like hip hop country or pop country like Luke Bryan or something. I wish she would have gotten a country singer or producer to help her produce the song. it probably would have been more authentic but I just think it's garbage honestly and it being at #47 right now says a lot
I'll stick with classic old school SOUL/R&B vocals and music!  Back then you had to really know how to sing and much more emphasis on vocal talent!
Just don't ruen country like this and cover your self up! Your not 16 Anny moore!
Who’s ready for tonight? ❤❤
She is garbage beyonce was dope back in the days when she was with destiny child
love beyonce pop or country
She is NOT a country singer, far from it, and is trashy in this video.  Country....HELL NO!
Garbage
Mich wundert weshalb so viele Familien zu diesem Lied tanzen. Das wäre Inzest. Ich war mir auch vor den Video sehr sicher, dass es hier nicht ums tanzen geht 😂
PUT SOME DAMN CLOTHES ON . OUR GIRLS DONT NEED TO SEE THAT FILTH . HAVE SOME RESPECT. PUT SOME CLOTHES ON. DAMN. TAYLOR SWIFT FOUND OUT US COUNTRY MUSIC LOVERS WONT EXCEPT HALF DRESSED LOOKING HUSSIES.
Girl...  you win! ❤
This song is catchy. Not sure about video.
She wants to be a role model for women but not sure the outfit fits that image..its 2024... why still the need so be semi naked to sell a record? Men generally dont do this...its like going back in time...If the record is good it will sell.
I thought she said herself it isn't country
Yeeehaaaw Lady ! Well done !
nice country song, shania twain?
"Resistance is futile" vibes.
Something is ten times shinier than the snake.
Boo
i love Beyoncé but this isnt a good song 😭
I can’t believe that’s what she’s wearing what kind of example is that
Fix them nails!  You’re not a f….g tiger!  Be proud to be a woman😊
Trash 👹
don't appreciate the outfit might as well be nude she needs to go back to her own music and leave country alone
This is not country. Hang it up Beyonce stick to what u know
The songs ok but they could have done a lot more with the video.
Over rated!
What a stupid video hahaha
I love it
This broad 🤣 she wouldn’t be 💩 if they didn’t kill Aaliyah to ensure Beyoncé spot in the industry. RIP AALIYAH 🙏🏻 oh and she can get away with this BS while “TRY THAT IN A SMALL TOWN” got all sorts of backlash come on American
I don't consider getting half naked to sell a song a plus. She ain't country. She ain't a cowboy or cowgirl.
Love this song
How about respect Country Music and putting more clothes on. It isn’t the right outfit for Country but ONLY for her regular music. Great song minus the swear word B**** (which isn’t used in Country music, they do swear but not in this way) sexual mentions and sounds.
You definitely are not Country! I do not agree with your decision, stick to your music, did you forget your talent  you are a master at your own music. What are you doing ????
Movie
Miss b needs to country movie texes holdem
a MAIORAL msm!!!!!!!!!!
I listen to country and I'm sorry but the song isn't country. She doesn't have a accent like u hear in country songs today she might be from Texas but honey u don't sound like country. Song doesn't either just randomly saying country words. Makes no sense. That's exactly y 99.5 or 94.9 will not play her song.
She definitely took a trip for 4 yrs to Georgia
This is disgusting
You need to stay in R&B stay out of country
I don't blame Beyonce you got the body hey do what you do😂😂😂
Horrible song. Stop trying to be like Taylor Swift. jealous much. She has no respect for country music, or its people. Stay out of country.
Dammmnn 😬🙄🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is ass
Wow such an amazing song!! Truly amazing wow!!
This aint real country
Great song, awesome voice, but put some clothes on appropriate for a Country song please! 🎵
⛰️THE ROC PYRAMID 🤘😈DRAC🪩 UNLEASH TIME
Sounds like a group of Vietnamize people getting their intestines ripped out of their mouth.
If you ask me I'm not a slender or bacon hater as well good slenders exist and bad bacons exist if a person puts on korblox or headless it's fine if they like it they can afford it and they like it some slenders are bad and mean if that's the case then I'm a hater if the slender is good then I am not a hater same with bacons
Tu chantes trop bien 🎉🎉❤❤
LLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEREEEE
Watch out country music here she comes
We get it you sold your soul
There is imposter among us.
k then, never into Beyonces music but, always appreciating her voice. Now I am interested and may be a new Beyonce fan. ❤
❤Would love to hear her unplugged with this song..only acoustic guitar
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
overrated i say again overrated
DON'T BE A BITCH. BRING IT ON!!!!
LOL @ this crap
You closes arent covering your boobs
Only this woman could get away with a video comprised of a looped 15 second video.
And that horse for your screen cover is flying in the air and you aren’t contrary
I thought it was kid apropeet
Your song sucks
She did that the whole music video
You can just feel how this has no soul or connection to the roots of country. It’s the weirdest kind of pop culture mixed with country slang
Not much to the song. Nothing to the video. She still looks good and sounds good but this was put together in a day. I’m guessing she’ll expect an award for this below average song and production
È sempre la stessa scena ma non ti stanchi mai di guardarla
No one screaming Cultural Appropriation huh? Interesting
who is ready for Tomorrow cowboy carter album 🎉?
this is country as written by chatGPT focusing on as many keywords as possible
Incrível
😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤🤠🥹🥹🥹👏🏼👏🏼
The song don't need you to come out half naked
2:52 2:54 2:56
Seems very suggestive
Example to follow, woman, your music gives breath of life, blessings to each one who reads this message, support our foundation for hungry children and families. ❤
Yuck
Are you trying to say something with this song ? What are you guys gonna do in Texas????
This isn’t country, yall need to stop this shit.
People are so delusional😂   another culture taken by hoeism. 😂
Trash
Èè
Wtf is is shit
Who gives a shit about duct tape,ddble sided, whatever. When was country music half naked ppl on their .
this is not country music!
A gata é um furacão, tudo o que canta é sucesso pq ela é o puro suco do talento! Quem gostou, tá gostado! Quem não gostou, entra ai na fila. Como diz nosso hino brasileiro do deboche: Se me odeia deita na BR kkkkkkkk
Why dress always naked😢
I love this, regardless of what people are saying
Lmao... Sounds to me like she ripped off gretchen wilson...
Beyoncé Miley collab is coming!!!! omg
This is the country equivalent of what she does with pop. She caters to the least common denominator and keeps it simple expressing essentially nothing. Of course you can't expect much from a woman who went from independent to "pay my bills".
This is not doing it for me. Pass
You call that country music that is trash some sorry shit
She will Never be Country
My top 2 favorite genres are EDM and Country. The fact that Beyoncé did a full album of both genres before Rihanna PISSES ME OFF
Excellent!!
Why does she need to not wear a shirt!  Great song but video 🤬🤬🤬
All gringos guys from texas making tik toks cowboys  ... hugs from mexico RETURN texas THIEVES
Just put some clothes on! I don’t want kids mimicking this and ending up w you all at PDiddy parties
It's such a nice song. I wish she made a video way better than this one. From the start to finish, geee!are you kidding me?
If I can block songs, I would block this one
This ain’t country!! Lyrics sound country, but the sound is not. Decent song though
You are a good dancer.  Why make this with this song? is so dancing song
everyone please like this video becuase the song is good
I wonder if he was respectful to them young crying girls
This isn't Country. This is a song about Country.
Wow sie hats noch drauf wahnsinn B voll hammer das lied
My dad’s a big country fan. Seeing Beyoncé make a country song really makes my dads saying make some real sense…. “Country gets us all in the end.”
THIS AIN'T TEXAS
This just doesn't seem legit. Can't get with it.
What a horrible video… worst ever
❤beyonce est pour moi l’exemple de la mère parfaite 😅🎉
i want to rip my ear drums out after hearing this for 200th time
I hear Louisiana by Reyna... Was this inspired by that song?
The song is almost as bad as the video.....
This is awful lol I can’t believe this song is supposed too be a hit 😂
Boring and repetive background!
I'm pretty sure that this vid is gonna get taken down one day 💀
This is not country never will be staying in your lane
Oh come on why does she have to get her ti'fdsts out.  Let the song do the talking 😮
Langweiligstes Video von Welt!  🤪
Unexpected fab song 👏
Anyone else just want an actual music video from her? I actually feel this is a proper cop out, look at how many plays and comments it has!
I really don’t like the video cause it’s just repeating itself over and over again I mean, did she forget to dance I really was looking forward to seeing her dance that song like everybody else is doing. I think everybody does a great job besides compared to her.
We NOT TEXAS
Yasss queen  Beyoncé is amazing
You Go Girl!
WTF!! I was so exited to see this video..it totally  disappointment me. 😢 love the song though ❤
Some obscure (to the mainstream) band trying to make it in Nashville is going to cover this song and it will do for them what "Gin and Juice" by Snoop Dogg did for the Gourds.  Some New Grass contemporary bluegrass band could make a hit out of this!!
Attention all people from Texas …..Beyoncé just warn u about the tornado SO HIT THE BASEMENT ASAP or just leave Texas ….😢 Tornado is going to demolish half of Texas so pls take care of yourself ……is up to u if u want to believe or not😔
"Country song"  Dressed like a stripper
I can’t understand why so many ppl will go so far as to say the hate Beyoncé. What have this woman ever done to anyone of you personally  I think it’s jealousy and baby that’s an ugly booger and doesn’t look good on nobody
This is a married woman showing her breasts to country fans.  As Billie Eilish would say: "Duh, I'm the bad guy."
This is not country music
and what did she say ..............................'' trust your jacket''
i hope they find her accountable with jay z
Lame video, lame music
Essa quando volta , resolve abalar, estremecer e girar o capital da indústria mundial. hahahahahahahahah arrasa quiridah❤
Ummm,,'... I was looking for a line dance to go with this.
This song is a good song   Nice tempo everything you like So why all the  problem with it
Just came here to say how trash this song is.. wtf is this???
1:51
big question is will she ever stop doing bukkakes?
Good lord...
I was hoping it would be in some Weston bar
Not the video I thought it was going to be
Pity about the clip - just plain trashy.
Taylor still has her beat. #IsaidwhatIsaid
This is 🔥🔥🔥
Hot❤
This is the worst fucking song I’ve ever heard in my 32 years! Ouch, I’m propelling the beehive but this song is absolute fucking GARBAGE
SICK OF THIS SONG
Put some clothes on and by the way I'm in Texas for holiday 😂
She looks like a porn star!!! Why?
❤❤❤💯🔥🔥💯💯
Would be better if she button up jacket 🤔
This isn't a country song
This is the stupidest video I've ever seen in my  life. Beyonce should stay in her damned lane.
This song is embarrassing. What a useless attempt at 'country music'. Most unimaginative video ever.
Song ain't bad; outfit gotta go.
🤮
Only men with girlfriends/me, and girls know what 4 is
This comes off as tone deaf and fake, not believable and does not sound country at all. Its not even pop country. Shiiiiiit Lil Nas X song was more country just because BRC was on it. Im all for cross overs and I love B but this aint it sorry girl
How is this country? It's another artist spitting on country music thinking they're making country music. Please stop. Have some respect for your body! She could've at least dressed "country" like a real cowgirl and did some country dancing. The girls that were in brothels back then had more coverage than this.
What the actual frack? I like the song but this video is a bitch.
Kudoz to Beyonce for bringing our culture country music to No 1
I love how she just keeps walking and walking the whole time and does the same thing over and😂😂😂😂😂😂 again
I can't call Bey my favorite for a number of reasons, but best believe, the woman is a ROCK in the music industry, and I support her drive and her good vibes."This ain't a country song. It's a Beyonce song." 💯 🎯 (I do not own the rights to the aforementioned  dope ass quote.)
It’s the Franklin song!!😂😂
I'm guessing she's getting a little lazy with this video. She could have done more. She could have done more with this video as far as like putting some line dancing. Also the outfit could have been more western not slutty if she is trying to go toward the country side of music.
❤great  country
THIS IS NOT A COUNTRY SONG PERIOD
El video mas idiota que he visto de una canción
The devil has many forms
Where's the Beyoncé clip?
BORING. Horrible outfit. Song is catchy but someone else needs to sing it.
Kept waiting for her to do something different. Got all the way to the end a realized she only gave her producers 5 seconds to make a video.
I love you ❤️ my ex Beyonce ❤❤ I love more than Jay-Z
What a sad attempt to break into whatever she was trying to break into. She should probably stick to whatever she was doing before she made this song. What a waste of space.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not a fan of that outfit! What the heck Beyoncé, trying to outdo Lainey?  I did like what your cowboy outfit at the people’s choice awards.  I’m sick of women showing their breast!      Clean it up Beyoncé cuz your voice is the star, period!
This is offbrand Temu country
I love this song but don't why you don't go naked...you will get more attention..making the texes peeps feel like assholes as you can't even try dancing the way they do.....I m from South Africa Durban...get a life and buy decent clothes with all that money you have
I would never thought that Beyoncé sang this song. Her wardrobe sucks.
Disgusting!!  Singing straight monotone!!
More please!!!!!! 🙏
WTH
This is fucking awful
bro this song is trash
I love it so much ❤❤❤❤💋💋🫶🏻🫶🏻🔥🔥
Make another video with your dancers
She should stay in her lane. This is definitely not country music. This is GARBAGE!!
This is beautiful! What a talent! Go Beyoncé
Glad I watched the music video 😛😛😛
Vim pela Patrícia ramos
Garbage, throw up, puke
You need a t shirt because no one want to that
Can't she ever wear clothes that cover her.
Horrible
Don't worry, she's taped in that jacket. Nice and tight😂
I like the song. OK, not much of a video.
That's it for the video? What happened, Is she broke Or just stopped trying?
I❤Texas Hold'Em
Bro
I was expecting a video. It's just a loop of her walking?
Song is trash! It keeps on coming onto the radio and i have to change the station 😑
I dislike this song. Just my opinion, I ain't hurt nobody.
THIS SHIT SUCKS
Heeeeyyyyy it's Franklin  🐢
Came here to cleanse my ears from listening to Camilia Cabello's new song...
Texas hold em by beyonce is NOT and will NEVER be a country song. It needs to stop being played every 3 songs on every country station.
I like the tune. I don't like the look. This ain't the hood lady, put on some damn clothes.
Beautiful beautiful change Beyoncé beautiful
Beautiful chains Beyoncé❤
I love your music 🎶
Who reported for sexual content?
She is so damn hot❤
Jajajaja yo aquí vengo desde tik tok a ver el baile de esta diosa pero nunca baila...
I LOVE IT💖😊😉💖
Nasty. Put some clothes on. That's some cheap ass shit
What’s her problem ?
The video sucks. Reallly.
Okay y'all know I don't usually post. I only post when societies STUPID meter has reached 100. Can I get y'all to relax about Beyonce's Texas Hold'em song. She is not the first African American to do a country western song. Aaron Neville, Cowboy Troy, and even Ginuwine did Pony...relax people. All this hype is just putting more money in her pocket. Let's do some videos on YouTube about the overturning of Roe vs Wade and a woman's right to choose. That's more important than Beyonce in a video half naked doing a country western song.  The song doesn't even go with the video.  What does mini skirts, body suits, and stilettos have to do with Texas Hold 'Em poker? I mean she could have had African-American cowboys at least.  And yes people there are African American cowboys.
Maybe one day you’ll get album of the year. When you actually have a full album that is worth listening to and not just one song.
Lyrics are great, but for real Beyonce should stay where she does best :)
Well, I didnt see this one coming , but very catchy, Well played Beyonc'e,  we will hold'em on to this one with all your others! : )
Very pop. Everything is pop.
The damn thing skips LOL. What a stupid video
I like the song,but I would like it better if you had a shirt on :/
This is my favorite song ❤
😮
disgusting, does not represent Country at all
Can't she put some underwears like any standard singer????😢
This song terrible!
Poor blue
disturbing
Damn is there any black music artists not in the cult? No wonder why none of them build anything for the black community
Ormai se non ci si spoglia non si canta😅
Mesmerizing
This song sucks get this shit ban.
Crappy song.  I think the album will be crappy too.  I think she's just mocking country music because this crap ain't country
This video is sad! Not a fan of the song either but you go girl.
I'm here because of Tiktok, ban this shit
Not usually my thing but absolutely love this track ❤❤❤
This has got to be the dumbest video I have ever seen and I've been watching videos since MTV first came out. What the hell is she doing trying to get into country? She knows absolutely nothing about country or country music because if she did she sure as hell wouldn't be dressed like! Or rather NOT dressed like that.  And she just keeps walking from out of the dark throughout the whole video? Seriously, get some of Jay-Z's money and hire a choreographer.  And to think, I used to actually like her and think she was classy, until I watched a handful of her music videos, now I think a 2 bit Hooker down on Hennepin avenue has more class than she does.  What a shame, she definitely is not Destiny's child anymore. 😢
She be putting more trust in that jacket the I have in a whole day
WTH, is this?
A.i Beyonce got it
I thought the song was stupid,so out of curiosity I googled it cause it seems to make a big splash with alot of people? Video was even worse? I'm not surprised, America has a big appetite for twice baked stupid. Donald,you trend setter! Trump Stupid!!!
I love this song ❤❤❤
Wow when did country get so trashy 🤬 go back to the barn.
Another one ruins country music, just pitiful
I’d stick to pop
It’s not too late to delete this Bey cuz this ain’t it. Leave the country songs to the country folk! The video even sucks 👎🏽
No one is listening to this sh…
shit is fucking brainrot
I wonder whose idea was this that she has to be half naked she’s beautiful she might as well just start posing for Playboy, but I guarantee she was made to do it like that
YEAH!!!!
Get this shit off the airways 🗣‼️‼️
Me
This is not good
It’s better on mute
Ass
That's alot of skin. I think they wear more than that in texas.
This song is really good I'm a big country fan but i do have to admit that the video and outfit wasn't the greatest
Me
Porn pics. traditional sounds. world is full of naked people. boring.
We like song ❤❤
Put your cloths on!!!
FINALLY!  A Beyoncé song that I actually like (and the outfit is a plus too!  Maybe Cowboy Boots would have gone better though!)
Most annoying song of the year
what a terrible song
Nasty put some clothes on, why don't you?
She is almost 44 thats granny territory. What's real on her
I think it took longer for her to dress for the video than to shoot it!
Do Texans really enjoy this music ? For me it’s a parody of what country music really is
Worse fucking country song ever
The clip is sooo dumb 🤣
YAY ITS SO GOOD❤❤❤❤❤
Whats with this video?
Ummmmm this is ridiculous  maybe stand there longer I might change My mind
Your sexy
No basement in tx it's covered in flood zones just stupid. Lil Nas and Franklin cartoon rip off
É COUNTRYYYYYYYYYYY
Everyone who sees this in 2024 Have a great day and stay Healthy ❤
When you don’t put in effort, you get this crap…..
🤢 🤮
We got love for you in H town B. But honestly the only one who can get down with country music Nelly 💯
Love it
It’s crazy how this song is a month old and you racist white people are still commenting every second of the day “this ain’t country” when the song is already #1 on the country charts lol…😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Keep making her views go up lol
This ain’t country music
The perfect example of someone trying to sing a country style song and it sounding nothing like one
Where are your clothes???? Do you really have to swear too🤦🏽‍♀️. I’m not racist, before anyone decides to come for me, just curious.
I feel embarrassed because ima girl but the boys that are watching will know the top part of girls😢
This song can't get more boring.
J'adore 👍😍👌 la chanson ! ❤️🙏🙂 Par contre, le clip vraiment pas terrible.
It was released in 2024 you fvcking goose
Who’s listening to this in 2023
La chanson bien franchement. Maintenant quand je pense au Texas je pense pas à un salope à moitié habillé. Dommage
Jesus your kidding me didn't you hang out with the diddler country don't want you liberal fakers
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I came here hoping there was a decent video. Not the first time I've been disappointed 😢😢😢
Beyoncé is beautiful in that vest, but I hope this isn’t the official video.. if so it sucks
Joe bickett wont come out of fox news
Fox news
Live evil evil live msnbc fox news

This lady keeps yelling at my daughter
Beyonce knowles is a murderer cia
Whoelse is ready for act ii COWBOY CARTER🤩
Love the song but video sucks she can do better than that she has great videos but not this one
She did it…     She made country music cool again, let’s keep it cool.
Women in country songs don't dress like that ... !!!!!
Song is nice, she can pull out anything
This song sucks butt cheeks go listen to Morgan Wallen . This is wannabe country an embarrassment.
I mi
I never was the biggest fan of Beyoncé. However, I appreciate a lot this song, I love country music, here in Brazil we have "sertanejo", which would be the equivalent of the country music in USA. Congratulations, Beyoncé!
BeyHive! Only 2 days until the "Cowboy Carter" albums! 👑🐝
STUPID VIDEO
Not the greatest video, but it IS THE GREATEST Country song by a Black American. Love it.  ❤️
XXXXX rated.
Please delete this song it’s so bad
0:12
This song is just so bad why does it keep popping up on my recommended 😭
🗑hot garbage water 💧 😒
Who came here because of TikTok
Sucks.
Song.. mmmmm video so bad.. always teets outs. Com on. Nope
It's a good song. Great work keep it up.
PATHETIC
**this aint texas**👹
Real life hoe down
This shit lit
That’s the video? Why the fuck is she so full of her self 💀💀💀
Bonnie Burckhalter. Love ya ❤️
This is awesome.i want to here Jay Z now
This is the worst crap I have ever heard. Terrible video with absolutely no imagination. The only thing good is her voice other than that the rest of it just stole 3 minutes and 57 seconds of my life.
This is not country im sick of this shit man wtf
I like the song but why is the video repeating the same overly weird and sexualized thing over and over and over again? YUCK!!!
We don't cry appropriation like most. We are happy to have you in this genre. Great song.
You're not country and country singers know how to put clothes on. Go back to your regular singing please we like that.
Nah i dont like country  This song drops  YEEEE HAWWW 🐴🐴🚜🚜🚜🍎🍎🤠🤠👢👢
What a boring video to watch! The song is ok, though.
Music ok but she. Is NO COUNTRY LADY.   A country lady knows to keep her business under her clothing and her language is offensive.  Take it back to the ghetto. .
We need a remix with Dolly Parton that would be Epic putting it out there in the universe 🙌🏼🫶🏼
But why?
Was expecting some badass dancing 😭😂😂
Isn’t that cultural appropriation?
WTH was this? Like a bad acid trip dang!
Ur next
Me: Beyoncé do you use a gun?  Beyoncé : i will use my hand gun.
It’s not even a country song 😭
Kids would not whach this
Ruined Country .. 🤬🤬🤬🤬
Were is the video  with her singing  it ?
This is no country 😮😮 at all !!!!
This song sucks so does beyonce
🤘👽
This is pop not country it doesn't have the soul that clasifies country music
Who is listening to this song in 2027
Who is listening to this song in 2028
Who is listening to this song in 2026
❤😊❤😊❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊

This is proof that we will always be better than yall 😂😂😂😂
If you're going to genre hop to grab cash, at least make a decent song.    also, you're aware that any real cowboys of the time would shoot you dead just for being a n*****?
🤮
THIS ISN'T COUNTRY THIS IS HIPHOP BEATS AND ITS JUST AN AI NOT A REAL VIDEO WTH?
The one eye illumination symbol tells you all you need to know!
Why do these stars always have to be practically naked to perform… corrupting young people once again with another genre! The song is horrible and not country … just another pop sound for money!
THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF JUST ALL MY FUN TIMES IN LIFE 😂
Yes Beyoncé yes  I'm your biggest fan and my big sister can we get VIP tickets me and my two little sisters and my big sister
Sorry...I'm not a fan of this country song...
Love it❤
I’m going out for lunch and I’m not going back home till late so I’m just trying not going back out for a while and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to 😂😂😂😂 I I’m not even sure if I can get
THE DEVIL IS HERE, CREATION TIME 🔥🔥🔥🤘😈
Deja Vu or Groundhog Day would have been a better song title based on this video!!
This shit sucks this is not a country song
A woman in her 40’s and a mother of 3 can still dress this way for the public?   Ok, her body her choice!  Cheers to the young generation 😢
❤❤
I'm from Canada , and I just want everyone to know , this is just TVO Kids  , Franklin theme song. LOOK IT UP
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" remains at #6 for its 6th week on the Billboard Hot 100! Keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! 👑🐝
UNLEASHED 🤘😈
Love it
Absolute trash! No matter how much money you throw at it or how hard you try, you will never have the talent for country music....gtfoh and go home.....
Was this Beyoncé idea or the people creating the video because I swear she is doing the same thing over and over for 4 minutes.
I enjoy Country music.... But this is hot garbage🗑.... And im from Houston,Tx.😢
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
You can use this song to release emotional stress...fast!!  #1 What is stressing you today and how can it be worse (20 sec) #2 Sing or read words on the screen captions ( 1 min) #3 Get up and dance for the rest of the song.  Repeat 2 times and your stressor will feel permanently less tense.  This is called #mindcardio for self regulation❤
Well I'm.sure her daughters will be dressing and behaving in such alluring manner..after all..lead by example..B apparently is a great example...
I'm a All Music fan. If it's music. And girl you got down!!! Can't wait to see what you come with next
It's so weird to hear a country song with the N accent.
Another pop country song. Shit like the others
Tan bueno música ese video no le hace justicia
I don't care for it, especially the video. Not her style. What possed her to do this anyway
I love Bey but for the life of me I don't understand why the beyhive Don't be going after Jay-Z Epstein??
Žasu
She has so much trust in that lever jacket
Meh
Song isn't bad, video is is less than disappointing.
The Outfit doesn't fit the song and the video is stupid as faaak!
Heard a radio host say that she was a big of a country star as johnny Cash was, what a loaf of bs. 🤮
Refreshing lot ppl s minds especially our age I love it
its beantiful
Oh come on u guys, the vest is taped.  Really
Now it just didnt sound country enough.
It's very good ! I like it a lot ! ❤❤❤ I have a Korean on it ! 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is this all
Lovely & sexy country-song from the queen ♥️💯
Straight garbage 🗑️ Disgrace to country music !
Love this song
Love this song ❤️
BEYONCE IS DEF TRANS
Song is Good but video is tired
Diva ❤
1:52 sussy
This ain’t country
As above so below all UP IN YO FACE
No navel. She's a clone
She is left handed
Think in heaven but you living in helll. Please com to jesus b/c i love you
Average, i know better songs and singers who make this music style really shine...
It doesn’t matter what project Bey does she is going to have fun with it. She could do a rock album and still sound good
SMASH— but what a boring video.
Ewwww
Why is she wearing her panty hose backwards?
How damn embarrassing and sad lady this isn't what country is all about put clothes on that nasty crap
Why the same moves every time
Song is assssss
Beyonce single-handedly saving country music
This song is so bad
she needs to make more moves for this video dont come for me im disapointed only one move over and over she has done way better
They spent like 5 minutes writing lyrics and 10 minutes shooting the clip. Are you kidding?
So park ur Lexus (woo) throw ur keys up ❤
I'm not trying to be mean, but this ain't country..... It has a country beat. She isn't singing with a country accent.... Like you know how Taylor Swift came from country..... How her country accent went to regular singing and pop...... And as a fellow Texan it's like whaaaaaaaat!!?....
Sux ass
Real current US. Shootings, Tornadoes...
I don't get this, why she trying country? she's RNB and this is sooooooo far from what she's known and loved for! Don't like it 😕
C'est exactement comme tout ce qu'elle fait habituellement, sans âme , sans talent , sans personnalité , aguicheur et commercial, je n'ai jamais retenu une chanson de cette artiste , jamais j'ai trouvé chez elle le moindre talent de composition .
I wonder how many takes this took because the jacket fell off
Destiny's 304
dou knowwhat i want right now
Hell naw. Couldn't do it with clothes on? Seen one seen them all
Put a bra on love
Beyonce. Ffs. Stop calling women the best word.
😂😂 No shit 🤦🏾 my confidence i could never find it 💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
Goedemorgen  ik den jan u     Goedenmorgen. Ik ben  jan. Uit. Den. Haag.
This shit is about as country as Outback Steakhouse 😂
Toll. Jetzt haben wir ganz lang Beyoncés gemachte Brüste gesehen. 🎉 Dusseliges Outfit.😂
BEFORE BEYONCE in her 1981 born Gen-Y Millennial/now Gen -X ( they keep changing the year born definition, Millennial used to he labeled as 1977-1983 borns) Song this, She WAS ALWAYS A TEXAN FIRST.
My parents won't speak with me anymore because I haven't sold a script so I have no more relatives. Jes
She should be ashamed of the way she's dressed. Her children will someday see this. Those little ones are gonna have a lot of questions
Low budget video and double sided tape 😂
Me caga esa canción horrible
I didn't know that beyoncé made the song but why do she don't have on a bra or a shirt
BeyHive! Only 3 days until the "Cowboy Carter" albums! 👑🐝
Damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Beyonce is truly gifted and transcendental.
Shame she had to dress like that. As a mum of 4 daughters, it would sadden me if any of our girls did that. Each to their own tho I guess
I'm here for the boobies.
I could never wear something like that
I usually like Beyoncé, but this song is really annoying. It doesn’t even feel like a country song AT ALL. I’ve been hearing this in every YT or Instagram short and decided to give the whole song a listen. I sorta wish I hadn’t.
She can go country if she wants, but this song is not a good one.
This Artist aint never insulted no one thats why she keep rising she continues to compete against herself. And damn improving so all the racist, the haters and the people who can't do Go sit in the corner Watch and Learn how to be awesome #1❤
I don't like country music, but I do like this song.
This is one of the best country rhythm in 20years. Do it Beyonce, they mad!!!!. Don't be a bitch Texas go dance with Beyonce ❤🎉😅. Pour sugar 🎉
Is this all the video is? Just Queen B walking up half naked, with fake hand gun finger that "Kapow" like a pop gun? Kinda disappointed B!
Beyoncé à beaucoup de talent  dommage  qu'avec  3 enfants  elle eprouve encore  le besoin de se montrer à moitié  à poil comme si son talent  ne suffisait  pas
stop with this song.
Yesssssss ❤🔥🔥🔥
They shot a whole music video, but this was the only footage where nip slips weren't visible.
Not only no but fuck no! This is not country!
Cool song. Scrappy video
This ain’t country music Blud
this shit blows bro i aint capping
Eeeew
Love you my Queen 👑❤
QUEEN of ALL QUEENS BEYONCE 🤘😈SHE IS DRESSED SO NICE. WE GONE WEAR SOME OF THE SAME STUFF. ME SUPER NAGA
tell me why it took so long to realize that she was just doing that the hole time 😂❤   But she slays in that coat.
Pls take this shit off yt🙏🏾
Song is horrible! Beyoncé stay in your lane, stay out of country music!
most country song ever
She is so pathetic. Stop messing with white people music
I hope she understands that good country music musicians don't need to be half naked to make good music
Dumpster fire 🔥
Fake country😢
U bleached your skin for this garbage?!?
Lame, what’s next, death metal?
Neta ese es el vídeo??
Your song is good I don’t know why I don’t know why everybody else is bragging about you. It’s OK.
Beyoncé naceu pro country, q vibe
"This isn't county" As somone that grew up on a Ranch in the Midwest BBY YES IT IS
Wtf
Nice sounding song but it has no story behind it. But there should be awards for the quickest video ever made, lol!!
Where is the pole she can swing on?
don't ever make country music again
Porn that pretends to be music. Snake. Appropriate. 🤮
I think its a strip club not a song
Porn star?
Ok pero  que pedo con el vídeo que falta de creatividad no es a lo que nos tiene acostumbrado xq siempre es creativa con sus vídeos creo Con una buena coreografía tanto como la canción y el vídeo Hubiera sido un un hit pero solo su canción es un hit
So Good! Everybody knows her beautiful voice!
Trashy.
Bad not really a country song
Aburridisimo el video.
Sorry, but she has no class. She could never pass as a country artist either
People are always trolling this beautiful woman.  She's successful,  beautiful, talented, and fortunate.
I'm not looking at them, they're looking at me
Ok i can see the confusion
0:32 Bless you! 🤧
Corny !
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now surpassed 200 million streams on Spotify! Keep pushing! 👑🐝
I dont know why, but this seems like a missed opportunity on the a really amazing classic Texas video/ Just no other message but a travel cross the desert
A Beyonce and Chapel Hart collaboration would be awesome. 💕💕💕
Tell me why she’s basically just wearing a coat
Sounds like gospel not country.
Hay un grupo de telegram que dijo que me pagaría por reproducir está cosa
Vulgar
No
Wow!! The BET awards, Grio, NAACP etc need to add a country music section to encourage more and more blacks to sing this genre. They should also give a history lesson during the induction of it. Im in my 40s and I have always liked country music since I was a child. I have always liked country, folk, rock and roll ( 60s, 70s and 80s rock), jazz, RnB, etc. I had no idea that a black man Deford Bailey was the first man ever ( no matter color) to sing country music and was the first person to perform at the Grand ole Opera. Can someone contact these awards and ask them to develop the “Deford Bailey country music award”?
I'm going to support every country song she puts out.  Cause luck the racist ass people hating
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" is now eligible for platinum in the US! 👑🐝💿
What a rubbish this. Music industry ran out of good singers.
Eww terrible face it girl you never getting Grammy of the year award so just stop trying
The video is as horrible as the song. Ouchhhh
Banjo could have lended itself to the song better as root or 5th. Lyrics are also not that strong, but it has a nice flow so it goes unnoticed to most mindlessly singing along. Vocals are on point as with any Beyoncé track.
One of the worst and most annoying songs ever written, that is all.
The motive is so blatant and so obvious its embarrassing. The song is awful the whole video pure nonsense.
I like the song but she could of been dancing
Ears bleeding.. stick to what you do. This isn't country 🤣
Can some one please explain the lyrics ? Because I dont understand de meaning behind. Whats the thought ?
No thanks, I am in the minority here, but this is awful in every way.
Boynce has so much trust in that jacket
Just stay black it’s not difficult
No, just no!
Stay Black it shouldnt be too hard
That ending starting at 3:19 is EVERYTHING 🔥🔥🔥🔥
She's under hypnotism from Jigga
I can’t believe she is dress like that
That is too obvious!
Our country ladies can sing without being naked!
Супер 😊
This gotta be the worst song ever written
This is a horrible song coupled with a horrible video. It’s horrible.
I have two words fir Beyoncé and that is Yummm Yummm ❤
https://youtube.com/shorts/C3ZThB_fflY?si=ZjYLL0xLn1mVw24q
❤!!
You say this aint texas.. Well this aint country lmfao this just a pop song  I know people gonna get mad and call me a hater but say what you want. We all have our own opinions.. And this is mine lol
Do people actually think this sounds good or does it only sound good because Beyoncé did it?  It’s just like Ariana yes and. If any other unrecognized not yet famous artist did it, I’m sure they wouldn’t make it up there
This video is a massive disappointment.
Why are you starting again again and again
i came to listen to the song , all i heard was boobs
Shes broke the internet againnn OMFG didnt think she was gonna do a song like this OMFG 22.5mil views go on girl
Gangsta rap soft porn accompanied by a fiddle and a banjo, flogged as country music. I doubt many who actually paid for this mediocre warble are actual country music fans. However,  to quote Beyonce, her actual fans do enjoy a hoedown.
Got the keys to this Lex us thanks too 😁
bad song-
Not sure with the breast out like that, not sure that is  setting a good example for children or young people.
Unpopular opinion i cant stand her voice
God I love her. This is more authentically country than most strictly country artists today
The Quenn❤❤❤
Shit
Buns big or small
Look at all the people she brought together to not hate country music anymore 🥰😂
Why does she sound like Shakira a little bit
Honestly, I like this better than the usual.  I haven’t been a great fan since the end of Destiny's Child, but this is sweet!
dirty texan music with nudes wtf @beyonce
This is awful 🤦🏼‍♂️
Remember when Beyonce was classy now she's just plain trashy. The reason country music fans rejected you was because we aren't interested in trashy and ho class trash.  Do better Beyonce you have a huge platform to influence a lot of impressionable fans. So sad what Jay-Z has transformed her into
This is in my top 5 worst songs of all time
Also this video sucks wtf did they use just a ai clipnreal quick so they could work in secret still on a Terminator beyonde video
Im sorry that i said she was gonna relinquish her queen bee status to a deserving...naaahhhhhh
I like how she made a country song about absolutely nothing. Real moving.
I am so sick of this song, and her voice does not sound very good in it
🔥 🔥
This seems so dark
She’s too old for same ol shit!  We know she has implants and we’ve seen her body … time to grow up and accept she’s old now in perimenopause
I think it was so Hot during filming she had to throw some clothes away. 😂😂😂
Great song, but why the boring video?
🎉went platinum 🎉....haters quit hating😢😂❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Very creative.
I love this song it's the first time I heard it
Bravo. I love it ❤
👏👏👏👏✨✨✨✨ Damn girl you are looking baddie and fabulous.  Pour some sugar on me honey 💋🍯 🤠 rock it girl 👏👏✨✨✨💋
When the music is just musicing 🥳🤠 Beyoncé's mind
I love you girl
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!!
Ah that stunning lady doesn't have to show her cards, a friend of hers already gave  her fella a quick glance😉
WOW!! This song is shit😂😂 This is NOT country🤷‍♀️ Just my opinion..
HEYYYY ITS FRANKLIN
This ain’t Texas 🎉
❤
Love the song. Beyonce has so much talent, but that video sucked I think. Now how many times did she glide in to view. That got old and boring real quick. But even so she still my girl.
🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻💯
Is this the music video? Songs ok videos crap, she getting a bit like Madonna ...we've seen it all before love , put it away and have some class
Reminds me to “Something in the water” by Brooke Faser.
No don't care for this song from her. Don't do country music please 😂😂😂😂😂
Could this get any worse? Terrible aong, terrible 'video,' Pathetically stupid lyrics.....
Me duh
Her budget for this music video is $45
No, this is Patrick
Who just can’t stop listening to this masterpiece?
This is just a looped video. The song is good but the video sucks
Next Up: Beyoncé sings the redneck hill-billy anthem, Deliverancé.
I love Texas people, I am from india❤
Bro Beyoncé you suck at country music pls stop
Tight budget?
BeyHive! Only 4 days until the "Cowboy Carter" albums! 👑🐝
Super catchy beat, but I just don't get it. All I hear is an egomaniac wants to try and win in a new category cuz they need something new to feed their ego.
I just came to see her 🍼👈🏼🤷🏻‍♂️looks so yummy 👈🏼😋🤤😊🥰😍😊
Good Song. However how can Beyoncé complain country music people not accepting when  she comes out in that trashy unnecessary outfit. Beyonce - Kanye West needs no help in objectifying women
Nice song
The worst video ever!
Would have rather seen her in a country outfit doing the line dance.   How shes dressed doesnt go with the song.  I think the video is stupid, but i like the song.
What kind of stupid video is this?
I don’t know what she was thinking but it’s not like she has to make a new single it’s just not her & she has lost me totally and 👎❌👎💩🤮❌⭕️👎💩⭕️❌
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑you all are sheep
That boob job is doing wonders
Who is listening to this song in 2025
It’s a well written good feeling catchy pretty tune. Everyone hating because a pop artist is doing something different. This isn’t the same thing as mgk making subpar “punk” music. This is actually really pretty and enjoyable. People just hating because they don’t like genre lines being blurred.
Love the song; hate the trashy video.
Any Brazilians here in this Texas anthem
this video was boring as hell!!! such a shame, cause the song is great!
This shit is not country
Why  Boobs showing
This song is racist
Love this it’s awesome her music rocks
I can see this song being used this summer for a hershey's smore commercial for camping
... is this actually the video?
The Queen is marching to reclaim country back to its roots!
Well that is a minute of my life I wasted.  She is way to talented to be singing such a crap song
A super-short video on repeat and full of sleaze shots. A new low for the music industry.
This is ass
I love it
Oh, I want to do that
Aaaaaay wew hew l love this song
Try that song in a small town , I recommend you don't.  🪕This ain't country🎻.... no country man drives a Lexus.
This sounds a lot like LA County by Lyle Lovett.
❤❤❤❤❤
People who hate Country but love Beyonce    The people:This is so Good
Why she keep doing that???????
This song has attacked social media.
So.... the whole clip is her on repeat doing the same shit? 😬
Shits trash
The first Beyonce song I have ever liked in her solo career.
Bro said it in his brain 💀
"Hey its franklin, comin over to play"😮😂
I like the song but the video is dumb
Franklin the turtle song
Is it just me who's heard the first part of this song before?!?!? I feel like I'm going mad.
Dreadful video same thing over and over
am i the only one not liking this at all sounds ridiculous
What the fuck is this shit
She has more trust in that jacket then j have with my mom bff brother dad my everything
She doing the same
She not even saying nothing
Me
😑 me cai gacho
Can she cover up? Kids see this.
I hate this song, this song sucks! This is not country, it’s a country wanna be. And the video is even worse.  From Texas!
Why?!?!?
This song sucks!!!!
Corny ass shit!
Me
Boring and a crap video
Sucks .    Not country and she could had  done a much better video    .
Black people created Country Music BTW do your Research
Nope
Why????
Looped video?
She probably wants $100 per night.
Why is she PREDICTABLY half naked in a Goofy Costume .. . .    again ?
Sounds like cultural appropriation to me, but if a white person wears dreads black cry about it. Which is Nordic.
Love it
cover up
Tell me how many dislikes this song got for YouTube that be great how about that YouTube?😂😂😂Lol Big joke, not country almost gospel in a way sad to hear. Ruined my day.
Can't wait for cowboy Carter it's 5 days y'all
This is wack
It’s a pretty decent song but this is got to be the most very boring video I’ve ever watched! Lol that same thing which is nothing over and over and over. OL horrible video!! L O L
Am here after tik-tok🥂
Me
Here’s a comment to show that I watched this in March 2024
Amerece
What the hell is this clip? ☹️
a little disturbing tbh
Who in the hell told this women that she can sing country music cut the crap off keep doing watchu doing but don’t disrespect country music like that
Why she only making country music am not hating just asking
This song is crap and Beyoncé will never be good at country music or being a Texan
No cus why is this actually good 😭😭
PEEPS PEEPS PEEPS PEEPS PEEPS PEEPS IS THE MARSHMALLOW CANDY THATS A TREAT
Use this comment as a dislike button
Beyoncé, everyone loves your song but why I say like don’t be a bitch Go take to the flow now you don’t have to say all of that the way that you said it
Cringe
I don't like the song or the video.
what kind of nonsense video is that?
Beyoncé is trying too hard
Wtf is this
Enserio esto es todo el video???y de donde sacaron el challeng???
This is the best Country song ever, check the charts and the people. Not the Russian Bots
Would someone please tell Beyonce, it's time for her to fade off into oblivion.
Oh this is horribe
I don’t like country music much but this song is actually pretty cool. Has a pop beat to it and I was whistling to it. I actually like it a lot. But this is the strangest video I’ve ever seen because of the repetition!
This song sounds heavily influenced by The Rolling Stones prodigal son.
This is the worst song I’ve ever heard. Sounds like it should be on an episode of cocomelon.
most boring video ever dude
Heyyyyy it’s Franklin!!!!!
Who’s listening this song in 2030???
0:10
Shout out to Rhiannon Gideons the banjo player!
Halo
Too bad she has to play the sex card  ...  she'd have done fine without it.  Too bad.
WONDERFUL🏆🌟
Cant decide which is worse, the song or the video
Bloody strong tape on that waist coat 😂
Who else sees ziggy stardust?
This is not FUCKING country music
What in the world kind of city crap is this. I'm sorry for all of the Beyoncé fan I enjoyed her music growing up but this is junk music.
Tired of this fake country song people who don't listen to country call this country.
I love that song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Very well done!!!! Go girl!!!
😂stick with your old music please do us all a favor and don’t sing anymore country songs hopefully dolly will give her a good advice not to sing country songs 😢
EST VOCALIST IF ALL TIME
Don't know about Texas, but I would share love to hold 'em!😂
Really cheap always over showing herself. Imagine she has a daughter what a shame.
Seriously?
👏
Me
https://youtu.be/jpsyNJh9ZVQ?si=xUrlTsBgWEeuD7ce  Check out our synth pop version   Please let us know what you think ❤🥰
Is it just me or does her skin keep getting whiter.....
Beyonce, a complete embarrassment to country music.  Stay in your lane.
This is the fakest country song I have ever heard in fact this isn’t even a country song
This ain’t country music 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
I have been hearing this song from shorts but i gave it time  it's indeed nice
Why does it keep repeating??!?!
Wow!
this song is so bad it isnt real country its fake country
B is FAR BETTER an artist than this.. this is garbage.. RARE L for Queen B
...how you make extreme money with an old song and no video on YT, ask Beyonce.
Texas is  want  indépendant From USA I saw report in euronews
Wow, there was so much going on in this video how did they ever find enough camera men to catch all the amazing action and affects! SMDH this aint country...I like beyonce, but this aint it
Dafuq is this 😂
So unexpected Beyoncé doing a country song. Not surprising these guys doing a nice rendition. https://youtu.be/jpsyNJh9ZVQ?si=lmG7kjmIwX9I47Vs
Hmm... seems more like Franklin theme song (2000) to me😂 Just a bit more sped up, with different lyrics😂
She’s definitely smoking hot, and I like the song but in my opinion the video is ridiculous. It just loops over and over. Stupid video
Doesn’t sound country at all
Start a kindergarten fight in the comments
I ear ihis song i am un chile
She certainly has that AMAZING voice to sing any genre & she is beautiful.  but,  C&W female singers, in my opinion, do not wear G-Strings. You might want to wear a sexy pair of Jean shorts & fringe halter?  They don’t look like strippers.  just sayin’
Very very sad, Beyonce M K  U T😢
Worst “country” song of all time
I wish I could un hear this.
Why Beyonce wtf you doing
You’re 🍒 are stikking out of you’re jacket
Truly one of the worst songs ever made.
🐕 💩
Eu já gostava de country mesmo ♥️🇧🇷
beyonce doesnt need to sing country music to be nunber 1 on the chart  ..but come on if ur going to sing country music at least dress up n represented it right !!!! now of days famous bore singers change their style of music just like if they r changing their shoes
this video is trash
I hated this as a country song, seeing the half naked made no sense video confirming this is just tasteless and dumb, throw your keys up cause you drive a Lexus,  just soooo dumb!!!!!
The video is worse than the stupid song 🤦‍♂️
Heyyyyyyy it's Franklin 🐢
Beyoncé my bday i r september like u
Marvelous 😍
Esse é o clipe da música? Música tão bonita e a mulher  focs no corpo.
Girl, put some clothes on
I hate that people think this is a real country song cause it is not
Vayyy ☆Beyonce☆ablamız ateş ediyor 😉Cesur ve Güzel 👍👏
Horror movie. Trany land
😂😂😂😂😂 worst music video ever!!!!!
My friend!!!!! 😲😲
If you're a fan of this song, than you really have to check out this amazing mashup version!!!  https://youtu.be/rU0kuP2DawE?si=MXJ-6DqEufkv94SG
nice song. dont expect this from her. but why half naked?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😮
Garbage straight garbage
Literally came out in 2024
Annoying song on TikTok 🤮🤮I hate it.
0:11 pew
Awful
This song is straight ass
Beyonce said she discovered that 50% of cowboys were Black, and she wants to bring back country music to its genuine Black roots!! 🙏🏾👑
This aint even country music 😂
LOL,She sucks Taylor's ass, ass!!!!
And Beyonce is doing no favors to female empowerment by trying to show as much of her body as she can. If the music is so good, why does she have to perform nearly naked? Put some clothes on, act like a lady and go back to you trashy pop radio station.
Ugh. Yuck. This isn't country music. It's what you get when an artist gets so big they think they can do anything. The lyrics are awful. It took 7 people to write and produce this trash. Wow.
Trash
Sorry but you look, béyonetta ! American girls like show the form.
😀😁😀😀😀😀😉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 bitte die ganzen ist so cool Red dead redemption ❤❤❤❤❤❤ 2:33
This is the instrumental from a old french cartoon is name is "Franklin" 😂
It is an absolute detriment to music that no one here knows about MESHUGGAH !!!😤 They make they’re shows look super rad LIKE a metal show sounds, because they need the visuals to feign that the music is that good, but make no mistake about it, this ain’t never been better than no metal foo!!
While there’s some controversy surrounding this song let’s just take a minute to remember she can’t even write her own songs. I’m not saying artists have to but don’t pretend you writing breakthrough lyrics when it was written by 3 other people.
Can she just sing without showing her ass or boobs?
Ein toller Song ❤ voll nach meinem Geschmack ☺️🎉🤩
Why has she her breast out for a music video why is it allowed my son who is 11 was discussed.
Also the radio will never stop banging this
She doing the CADILLAC THING FUK THE VOLKSWAGON.. KEEP TOPPING IT UP.. ALWAYS SHAKE BACK.LOVE IT
Is there only one way to keep people’s attention, through nudity?
This shit is trash
Couldn't think of anything better to wear!! 😒😒
Franklin theme song best or what?! 😂
I'm seeing hella slow ahh haters in the comments lol... Bey is from Houston sooo of course she's going to show out for her Texas roots... like.. there's literally tons of garbage ahh music out here WORTH hating on‼️🗣️
❤
The official video sucks. How much was spent to do this boring video??? And since when does Beyonce show a Ratchett Image like this? Hated it!!!!!!
This hurts my ears and breaks my heart that she’s trying to act country this ain’t country sorry
Heard a lot of negatively about Beyonce's country music attempt, so I decided check it out for myself because I think she is a great singer. OMG, this song AND video are horrible!!!!
Let’s be honest this probably the dumbest song Beonce has ever made 👎🏽👎🏽
Woohoo bey luv it!🤠🙌💃
So is there a real video to this song or just the repeat weird thing?
BeyHive! Only 5 days until the "Cowboy Carter" albums! 👑🐝
Is this video just her walking with her boobs showing & her playing with herself?
Have we mentioned another issue related to Taylor Swift yet? Complete change of genre? TAylor wins and we have to listen to jz whine about how unfair the world is... if you can't beat them,  join them...WOO-WOO-WOO
Soft porn.   No thanks.   The song is good.  but visual is a distraction and superficial and plain awful.  Unless you’re masterbating.
This is a country song I don’t hate unlike the others

“That’s just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!!”
Wow she has kid's and you want your kid's to see that it's okay to show your boobs off  , and she's doing the same thing over and over again so how's this a good video and the song is terrible
She cant let Taylor out shine her Now she has to switch genres.
Fuck this
Could you be ANY less classy?  Oh and this shit ain't a country song.  A banjo a country song does not make.
Beyonce is her country era and i am here for it
I spent so much time not listening to this song to cave tonight only to have the visualizer completely eliminate any curiosity I had about this song at all.
#GREATSONG #HITSONG #CountryMusic #SANGER #SINGER #LEGEND #Beyonce Thank you for this beautiful creation and sharing your #TALENTS  ~Love, Emmanuella
You dance is beautiful, it is very positive ❤
This sucks asssss and its not country its pop music with a twang
Oh my this song came out last month and yet there is still no music video
I feel bad she stooped to this level she will get mad when she doesn't win anything, but probably will call ppl racist for it
Lets face it. This shong is absolute shite if you can call it that.  Its a clear over step on her part thinking shes all that.  Stay in your narrow bought highway lady. Jay got it all covered for you boo
Garbage.
Awful. Could be more colourful with nature, horses, and people. Ism sure ut us a beautiful state to show.
This really can’t be Beyoncé
Ew
This aint even country music, this is poser country
I love RnB music but my default sing drunk remains Contree music
Think you slick slipping in your ridiculous baphomet signals huh 🤡🤦🏽‍♂️
So she has to bring the naked trash to country music- great… 🙄 I’m sure Cardi will be next to see how nasty she can make it
She's trusting that vest jacket thingy a little too much-💀
What the luck. No. Never. Asinine
She deff forgot about dre .. what in the white girl is this 🫣    june carter ... Where is Jonny 🤣😎🤣
What a waste of time  is this video. So completely not country. I have no idea why she did this. What was she thinking?
A line dance to this song doesn't sound bad.🎉
0:56 A good strong wind and she gonna be in Titty 🌆 City... 👀
Andrew in The Pack😅
This is NOT country smh
Did A.I. write this song? Cuz.... Yeah just seems like a terrible attempt to appropriate country culture.
👎👎👎
Not ur best
Garbage
Sounds like shit
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=ptzdbs0kIdUhn-9W
The song isn't good.  This is my opinion. I dont need yours. Just a personal statement.
I'm confused! She from (Texas)! In Houston they always say we (Holding)! The lyrics are interesting!!
No no no no no
Was it the Choreographer’s day off?  Seriously disappointed!  👎🏼
It's hilarious that Beyoncé is trying to be country 😆
well fuck this and everything that you believe in.. This is some autotune shit and it sure isn't a good song... Gov. Abbott will hopeful sue Beyonce to have the name Texas removed from this word vomit shit..
The song is good, the video is so lame.
I like everyone else's videos to this song. Her 5 seconds  video, just NO.!!!!
I thought she would at least do the dance.
What a stupid song
Sounds like a cartoon song.
Dumbest video I have ever wasted my time watching.  Love the song, though.  Video was a waste of time.
Why does she need to show her boobs in the video? It looks ridiculous.
I can't even express how awesome this id,
What a stupid video 😂
Well, we know it ain't country she's selling in this video.  I could only make 10 seconds into it.
Wow ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I love it!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Won’t lie Texas hold’em  is a good game
I crying every time this is plating
Love the song -  feel like Beyonce dropped the ball on the video -  but the jacket 👍
Country does not fit into her style.
Je tm be la j'aime ton son il était temps que tu nous sorte une pépite ❤🎉❤ le cheval 🏇🏾🐎 me manque de ouff...,billyThis,bella,elfie...🤍🖤🤎🐎🐎🐎🏇🏾
Video sucks,

Ngl as a Beyonce fan this shit is trash
Why why you even more naked
Why's she gotta look like a hoe, beautiful voice. Catchy song but c'mon girl 🤠 this looks like an Austin Power's movie clip.  Still love the tune
That song is about the most retarded song I have ever heard in my life just saying, but that’s my opinion other people might like it
🤠❤🥰
no no no
WOW
In one word....SUCKS
Love the dong, video is daft, why didn't she dress country and do the dance
I mean this video has the best choreography on tiktok omg!
She has a great voice. Why dress like a hooker?
Gyattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
All the backlash that she received she deserved this ain't no damn country music like this is a rap attempt at country
so no-one says anything about 'cultural appropriation'?  is it because no-one cares about cultural appropriation anymore? or that no-one dare say anything because it's beyonce, a sacred cow if ever there was....?
I fucking hate this song
Oh yessss🍒🍒🍒
I didnt know rap music could sound kind of like country
Complete trash.
Sounds like a country song to me... I love ❤️ it!!
Me parece ridículo el video, pero la canción cool 🎉
Beyoubce legitimately is a cowgirl, she was born in Texas!!
What a lazy video
HOWDY!!!😊
Not country but better than most so called modern country.

Que porquería de video 😂😂😂😂
Beyonce and country music go together like covid shots and living a long life
Terrible video.
WAY OFF, YUCK
Me
Diz iz wat cum-tree moozik iz 💯🤠
Bro just stop
Ela e linda
Toller Song, aber das Video ist..... Ohne Worte....
Same clip repeated
Hi
She looks so much lighter as if she bleached her skin especially with the blood hair
I'm surprised she has done a country album before. I'm liking this song!
I might be the only one who finds this song cringey. I love Beyoncé but not a fan of this. It’s my opinion if it gets u mad that’s on u.
The pew pew with her fingers took me out lmaooo. I don’t get all the hype with this woman.
You
Winner of Least Effort for Video award.   PS:  That jacket/boob thing she has going on is something she is wearing, not her real boobs (or she has no nippilies).
Que necesidad de salir medio vestida 😂😂
This song sucks ass
Nice outfit
Meeeeeeee
If we could really see the number of dislikes  👇🏽
Hey its Franklin  😂
I neuer saw the Video, heard the Song in the Radio. The Song is good but the Video is just uncreative.
That darn Bianca Censori shows up everywhere
Damn, queen of grift.
Texis hold em ft.beyosay
Sounds just like the rest of the  poppy nashville scene of fake country artists.
It’s Franklin…
K Michelle Tennessee song and video is 🔥
At bkkkk have it your wayyyy

This is terrible 🤦🏼‍♂️
It's hard to like the video with only ONE hand 😂😂😂😂
She didnt lost at poker et shés already naked
Texas hold em immigrants?
What's all that touching her body with a gun hand CRINGE
No no Beyonce smh😮
Vocals are great. Music sounds like a laundry detergent commercial
Her calling this "country music" is the same as calling Tim Mcgraw and Nellys over and over again country 😂
Great song but less curse words would be nice.
So not country
Oo oo ooo I love this !!❤
This aint country and never will be
She’s making fun of country people
Its getting hot in church we all need ice water. Kids hate time out corners saying bad words. ❤Jesus saves❤ Amen.
Im grounded
❤Jesus Saves❤Amen❤
Reba McTyre is the Dynasty Queen of Country❤ Every kid sings along without getting in trouble for saying bad words.. Soap taste nasty
Taylor went from Country to pop. Beyonce went from pop to Country and I'm down for it
Who is listening this song in 2024
Shoots without looking. She's good.
Love this !!!!
What the actual FUCK is this song and music video
that fvcking guitar intro🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boo😂
You stole that intro
I love ya❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Very sexy girl
Mega super geil❤👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This ain't Tiktok, ain't no Insta!
THIS SUCKS
Dame why is she to be in  Country when you can see here bobob
Please make a longer version of this...its a masterpiece
This song comes on, I turn it off. 👀
Bro thats not even a real song
I love that more artists of color are breaking down barriers and doing country. Country music got its roots from African American music. It doesn’t belong to one race. Anyone can enjoy it :)
People who love Beyonce ❤ like
One word  SUCKS
We created country music as well!
What an inspiration to young women, you want attention as a women, you show almost your tits!
my aunt hate this Song
i love you ❤❤❤❤
I don’t care what yall say this some Sell out shit! And if yall down load her Country Album yall sellouts! Texas is one of the most racists states there is I don’t care if she from Texas it don’t change who the white folks are and how they feel about us,  I WISH I WOULD! Play or support  this Bullshit!
Ok, so where did the dance for this song come from cause she just profiling 😮
This song was made for a political reasons due to the fact that Texans are asking for a complete separation from usa and demanding a full independence, smart move by Beyoncé to cool the population down.
You labeled this as country. You got girl
I just listened to a bunch of Tina Turner doing country. This is mediocre at best. Very mediocre.
Bah! Reba, DOLLY and Shania Twain put this little girl to shame.
🗝🌹🫶
لازم تتفصخ ما تقدر
I LOVE IT !!!!
Now we can officially say queen B and T. Swift switched roles.
She's definitely the greatest in the world❤❤
Wow that's  so good but quite  boring  at same  time
Bang 🤠🔥 bangg🔥
Oh Beyonce this song is just horrible. And the video sucks too
Hoe saai en ongeïnteresseerd kun je een clip maken 🥱😒
Cultural appropriation much! Goy some nerve alway complaining about cultural appropriation and you are the ones appropriating everyone else's cultural! The last time I  checked, the country is white people music! In your guys' own words!
My eyes can't unsee this shit now
Am I the only one that thinks this song is nothing special? Just a pop star thinking they can do country because they are a good singer but have no place in any kind of country song. Nothing meaningful in the lyrics, this ain't Texas, ain't no hold em, go park your lexis? come on, this music isn't good but I bet she'll win the grammy for best album this year...
This is dump
I came to report this stupid ass song
Stupid music video, waste of time 🤮
Best satire of Country Music I ever heard, honey!
Not feeling it.
These people ruining your country and you people love it. What a disgrace
Ok, how many times did she shoot her finger gun? I think I’m tripping out because of this- she didn’t do anything else. I’m so confused. lol
Bye y'all
Lets go
Beautiful woman, cool song ... must have run out of money when it came to the video director🤷‍♂️ doesnt hold a candle to irreplacable!
The song 👍👍👍👍👍👍😍😍 The video : 💀😭
No because why does she look 20 but she is 40
Fake country music
Either she really trusts that jacket or she has no essential needs for kids and stuff
I thought this song is about immigration control
Stupidest video ever!! Shows so much talent! NOT!!
Pleasse not on the radio, its goofy as frick
This is garbage.
Davina michelle killed this
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!! somebody farted behind me.
Me i hate this song 5 min later me singing😂😂
Shes pure trash. Young girls look up to this female and this is what she shows them. And the song doesn't make sense
Beautiful voice as always.... but the song itself, just dumb.
Awesome song, horrible video.
Symbolism will be their downfall see the left eye
Whats on her eye????
SEGURA PEÃO!
The inside of that vest is my spirit animal.
Love Beyonce, absolutely love this song and it was the best, but I dislike this video as it could have been so much better. Wish she had done some real country dancing.
Her u no what are hanging out
She has ruined country she needs to stay in hip hop😢
Beyonce is now a country girl
What a crap song
Those fingers she looks like she gonna sniff em
Love the song, hating on the video. Sorry
Why she like to show her assets to people? Her children are watching mommy go naked.... 😢😢😢😢😢
No.
One wrong move in that jacket and it’s over…
No dance 💃 with it or nothing
Lame video
I just wanna know why Texas Hold'em is linked to the video when the song is Rose's turn, but sounds like the Kurt version from Glee
I was halfway into the video when I realized I hadn’t turned my sound up and suddenly realized there was a song that goes with it. Love ❤️ it. Check out Mary Lou by The Creative Force, Amazing!
March 22, 2024. Miss Beyonce! It seems you got Competition!! Observe:>>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebn5r1dR51Q
And people call this piece of shit song country? I’m disappointed.
I like it alot.
Shit video. Good song
when the budget is $2.06 and a 2 year old mcdouble.
worst pop song i heard today.
This song sucks sorry Bey
Lol. She sucks. Its not the song that y'all be liking. Be honest. Never new you had to be have naked,  to make a song.  No respect for her self.
Damn if ya part of that "Lumi" shit,,anything you put out gona be fire lmao... People thinking this is fire,,industry puppets scared of Beyonce fuck her fuck Jay Z.. Stupid Demon type vessels... Beyonce knows,,,the Lord be real and powerful(she came from the church) Price be heavy hey B.... But this is Pure shit...10/10 May you see that Jesus Loves you,, And the "voice God gave to you",,has its purpose.... No more finding your own way on your own...
Peope was hating on this song but I really like this song and can’t wait for the album
Pure garbage and shows greed! Stay in your lane and stick to your crap music and leave country alone! Or what they pass off as country . This is pure garbage
Look at the crap she wearing! This ain't COUNTRY!
This is RUBBISH.
😮❤
Total illuminati, saddening to real country
Omg love the beat
The soung isnt bad but it is yet another underwhelming video.   Being hot doesnt mean that repeating the same 8 secs of recording over and over is impressive
🤔
استغفرالله  تستري 🙂👽💔
Elle fait du country avec cette tenue 😮
This song has been on my reply ✅
이첸 : 🐐⁉️
Love 🎉it❤
Yo entrando para ver la coreografía y resulta que se repite más que un disco rayado. No le veo el sentido o es que debo ser  más antigua que la era Mesozoica.
I wonder how much she paid Blanco Brown for this because it’s clearly The Git Up song. I love what she did with it tho
La canción muy pegajosa, pero el video no me gustó, más parece un desfile de modas, lo bonito sería que saliera bailando su canción que está bien chévere.
A better video would've made it better. Made it fun, this video boring
Me encantaría ver el video donde Beyonce baila
How many pro-blacks are pretending they like this hot garbage because they feel they have to in order to be pro-black, and how many white liberals are doing the same thing in order to be inclusive and anti racist? Because I don't believe anyone actually thinks this is good music.
Garbage
I like it 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
I love You much i want to YouTube
I love the way her glasses shine just like her, a woman of gold
So as someone who has always seen Queen B from afar, when I heard this I had a massive grin on my face (whilst singing along). Taking a genre which has SO much form and making it better?... Brilliant.
That jacket about to fall off😅
If taylor swift done an r&b song you'd all be calling her a racist but when a black woman does it its fine
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THIS ain't country!!!
She's totally overrated Sorry not sorry
Nice switch up I’m in pure love ❤
This song is absolutely horrendous
Beyoncé
Garbage.
Worst country song, sounds as bad as Shapiro rapping
Like watching Dylan Mulvaney doing Girlhood...
Does she ever wear any fucking clothes god dam cover up as a mother you should be ashamed not a role model for young girls
Slay girl Yass 👸
Horrible Song..Trash ruining Country Music!!!🤮🤮🤮
I wasn't expecting to like this new country side of Beyonce...but, I do love it! She rocked it! Woohoo! ;)
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Catchy song but the video is boring. Provocative but boring. 🤷‍♀️
I was not prepared for this video.
Anyone in TikTok has better videos than this thing 🤦🏻‍♂️
Ew
This shit suck ass !
For those who’s wondering why this video is a 10 seconds repeated clip because it’s visualizer and the music video is yet to come
Wiye  are you not. waring  a broke🥰💋🫶🏼😚
Yall this ain't country
NASTY
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Nudity and freemasonic symbology ✅
Put your clothes on this ain’t no cowgirl looks slugs disgrace
Te amo ❤
im confused
I hate this song 🤷‍♀️🤢🤮
C'est toujours le même clip c'est nul et c'est pas pour les enfants 😮
What a disgrace to country music.
Great song but the vid Beyoncé you can do better ❤😂❤❤❤
Your video is so inappropriate like no way little kids can see this
Is it country because of the fiddle and Banjo? If you replace that you can get a normal pop song out of it… the lyrics dont even do it. The end is straight pop. Maybe i am just confused. Add a folk guitar, take out some instruments it is folk. Hey take out fiddle and banjo,  add bells and its a christmas song, with texas lyrics. Just because you name it a certain music style it is not automatically. There is no country feeling and no country attitude in this siong and im not american and see and feel that. Btw song is ok as pop..
I know this ain't real country music...but she sounds more country then Taylor Swift these days....just saying
😂😂😂😂
Naw, this ain't Texas. This is the state of Quatisha James!..... If you know, you know.... Now put those bikinis on!
March 22nd anyone?
Why she has no shirt I am 8 yo
This is culture appropriation
When you aren't relevant anymore so you take your clothes off and have somebody write you a horrible country esque song ......
Most ugliest song I’ve heard
She ever going to change your outfit
Am I supposed to like this just because she is Beyonce?
Nasty put some clothes on 😂😂😂😂remember tht yall 😂😂😂😂😂
Nashville ought to welcome her with the biggest possible parade, and be thankful such an artist blesses us.
This song SLAPS!! I hope it wins ALL country music awards it can!! And I pray more black people take over this genre like football 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's the closest REAL thing to a goddess :)
Big meh
She’s so close to popping a girl put
Ewww
Got one eye covered up weird Illuminati shit
Beyonce please dont make this again please!!! Don't disrespect texas like this again ok just stick to what you was singing before ok because this....fucking useless
Good song but the cursing is so unclassy 🤨 you can make good music with no curse words!
Wtf
Jesus christ 😂😂😂😂
Who's this?
This song ALSO functions as a love song from Beyonce to her country heritage, which the "picture" of which in white fans' minds does not include her.  Be damned if I can't dance with you... and make it so good nobody can resist it!  (cue a world of scooting boots) It's a challenge song to the country INDUSTRY over who makes REAL country music, and who rules it.   She also INVITES everybody who "doesn't like country" to see it's great and for everybody.  The schmaltz in Nashville stems from the "bunker mentality" of seeing any great music as defined by racial exclusion.  The album is proof in performance and the reception is proof of its power in action.
absolutely disgusting.. dont dirty ( s l v t t y ) up country.. cause you aint it. ever !!
Only men’s can understand this feeling 😂😂😂
It is a legal nipoa
A very poor excuse for a video and all this dancing by everyone else of some song poorly executed and a video even more poorly executed. Just glad she didn't objectify herself in that video.
She doesn't even have a country accent. The way she dresses and curses in the song and the pop rhythm... definitely not authentic country!!!
Love from kenya 🎉❤❤
I’m sorry but this song is absolute  dog shit
Absolutely cringe
Yessss bey I f’ big love it!!!
Bringing the visual debauchery of Hip Hop to Country Music. Good job.
What the hellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Kinda boring 😂
This is bad for kids
She should have had cowboy clothes on in this video I still like it though but real country clothes would have made the video pop more to me....
Why does she have to be half naked to make this song?
I love u!
THIS GOES HARD ON MUTE 🗣🔥🔥🔥
She should do more Country
What makes her think everyone wants to see her cleavage 🤔🙄
Cow Girl B.youn.ce the lexical codification in Texas
I hate this
This isn’t even a music video it’s literally just her walking and it doesn’t match the music either she holds up a finger gun and that’s it
I wish she could make a music video out of this Texas hold em
This song is terrible, in my opinion
Cringy
Summer vibes🎉
I like her song. But this is the worst video!
El ritmo espectacular pero el vídeo una insensatez. Beyoncé tu puedes recibir más... tienes mucho talento, no te permitas retroceder.
SKANK!!
That's it?   LMAO   her thighs are flabbier than my 76 yo ones
u really trust the jakcet
Stop touching yourself. Please.
She Can’t afford a shirt? Or even a bra?
Sério que o video é isso?
Omg this is you girl this is you wow I like
Put a shirt on said perents      Beyoncé: wearing not shirt whith a vest
Absolute trash
the song is literal dog shit
Um...NO
I love this music I can't stop listening to it
Very disappointed, made our country stlye look Vulgar
LIKE IT  Beyonce  HA HA HAPPY
this is a fucking joke.
This is my fav Beyoncé song I love guitars 😉
go here
Put Dolly Parton on a remix 😊
I hate it sooooo much. And her too...just in general
Eww.
Why is the video just a repeat of tits mgee? Had a minor in the room when I started this
I would love to see her and Carrie Underwood
From what I've heard so far, she is more true to country than most of those CMA clowns.
This shit is trash. FRANKLIN WANTS HIS SONG BACK.
This song sucks, no thanks.
This is disrespectful to country artists.
Her confidence in this jacket is extraordinary. I need such confidence to trust myself.
I have nothing against the song, but the outfit …really?
Dolly would add a lot more fringe and lace to hide the double D cups😂❤
Dolly would add a little more fring to hide
Beyoncé é demaisssssssss kkk a gente curte tudo o que ela faz, independente do genero musical, a gente ama, pq ela faz tudo bem feito .......ansiosa pra ela levar todos os premios da premiação em que ela foi tratada de forma indigna !!!!!!!!!!! Bora Bey !!!
Least possible they could do here. Not even trying but forcing everyone to embrace this country song. Is this a joke?
Her music is dogshit
She is white now😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What would make it better if she would open her jacket just a bit more 😂
Fuck, (and i cannot stress this enough) This song. Sure as shit ain't Texas.
Queen bady
❤
Another song ruined by tiktok gen z absolutely perfect
Merci TikTok ❤
Damn I'm going to be here in this song over and over again
This is  the stupidest video to go with this song. It could have been a really fun video, instead we get this shite.
What is the point of this video? Half naked... dissapointing
Like the song thus vedio is so stuip all it shows her breasts partly showing u can understand why country music didn't accept her her song is good her vedio sucks
bof pas top
Why does it feel like Beyoncé simps be loving this the video  If you know you know
Wow you are brave with that jacket
Good song, sounds really good. I like it
I'm in love with this music! 😍🙃
This gives me 2000s músic Madonna ❤
Eminem raps it's cultural appropriation, beyonce drops this horse shit yall go crazy
This is trash....
Ppl who know it’s Beyoncé
I'm gonna slap a doo rag on my head and sing a song and say it's a rap song
So much cussing
More like rip off
Why is she white and hates whites?
I don't really like the song. It's not that country. I'm mad at Dolly Parton if you know, you know.
Only real country singer should sign country...sorry  Beehive .😅😅😅
Pemersatu bangsa
Hey its  Franklin
Wtf 😂
the top of the bitch
get me a bucket
Quem é Anitta perto dessa mulher né 🎉
There was a boogie, and now there's a hoe down. At the bar singing songs like she knows what country is.
Lame ass song! 👎👎👎
That baby doing the side eye with the pepper and water😂
Garbage
Haha.. one of the worst songs I've ever heard.
This song is wannabe country
What IS this ???
BeyHive! 1 week until the "Cowboy Carter" album! 👑🐝
queen *heart eyes emoji*
Real Pretty. Real Nice. Warmed my heart. Thank you.
Amazing nipple editing!!
Love this song, so catchy
Never bought a Beyonce album that I might buy this one. I really like the song I want to know what the rest sounds like.
Listen to Adia Victoria - Went for a Ride (From "My Black Country: The Songs of Alice Randall")
Should of named the song Jay I'm a snake ass bych
Are we gonna see her dance to this song? Something along the lines of: If u liked it then u shoulda put a ring on it. But country style. I'm waiting patiently.  😂
rsta cancion es de beyonce y los bailarines??
I don't get this Video. If this is a Country Song, why is she dressed this way😮 Where her Cowboy Hat 🤠 & Boots 👢 👢and why not wear something a bit leaning towards Country Music Fashion. Instead she is wearing a Leather & Stocking Crotch Outfit exposing some of her boobs & belly & the Video just doing the same old thing over & over, like they just threw it together, how boring😮 and are they eventually gonna remove her from the Country Music Charts like they did Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus' Song, "Old Town Road" & Billy Ray Cyrus is a Country Singer! I don't know about this Career Move
Sooooo… nobody in the comments can see this symbolism???
It’s a stupid song sorry
What type of video is this?  Just weird, although I really like the song and Beyonce's music.
This video should not even be on line. Or anywhere on the internet. You can see her breast. That is disrespectful and irresponsible for her. This video does not need to be seen due to the fact that she's half dressed and it just looks pitiful, hideous and like I said, it needs to go off of the air because you're not supposed to show your breast on Live TV or what have you?  I really didn't never like her. I like some of her songs, but after seeing this video. I won't be. Watching. Any of her videos?This is provocative, nasty and irresponsible.Because to a child does not even need to be seen.This video and the song is everywhere.She needs to grow up and put some clothes on for the next video seriously
Try that in a small town: CNN says it's racist. Beyonce shooting a invisible gun: CNN, she's the best! 😅
Boring video:(
Great song but... This ain't country
Worst video ever
Is she making FUN of country? I heard she had a country song, thought I’d check it out! Didn’t even listen all the way thru, had to turn it off
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Satan’s magical s*ut.
I swear if is see a comment with GYAUT or stuff like that…  update NOT EVIN 2 MINUTES AFTER THAT I FIND AND I QUOTE “she has a gyaut” IM LOZING IT LIKE THE TIME I FOUND OUT MC BE BRINGING BACK THE SWEET SPICEY CHILLY SOUSE
this ain’t Texas ❌❌❌❌❌ this ain’t country music ✅✅✅
Sorry this is my opinion I don't care what any of you say but this is horrible and this ain't country music thumbs down
Just awful…
The song sounds awful asf no country radio stations are playing it in my city😂😂
That is a very interestingly. inappropriate  She had to  rely trust that jacket
This song is freaking everywhere my gosh
is this video AI generated?
I love country music bc I am a Texan born and raised and I still live in Texas but in my opinion the people saying “this is the best country song” when they use her audio piss me off because even though it’s your opinion this is a good song but DEFINITELY not the best (don’t ask me the best bc I can’t decide I have like 20 tied up for first place)
Excellist
Jaja esperando q baile jajaja
Destroying original America music. Country
That's why their is no dancing that jacket she doesn't trust that jacket
Oh no. No good
Yuck!
Trash.
Video is shite. Why almost naked. Ooooo look at how beautiful I am. Thier all so self obsessed..
No soul, Black or white.
She straight up sounds like a dude now
i think i threw up a lil.
Period
I like the song, but this video is lame.
Boo
Don't be a B*$*#  come take it to da flo' now. WOOooo!
💙💙💙💙💙❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  dam I love that.... you go girl....🤠🎼🎸
Honestly, Taylor Swift is better than Beyoncé Swiftie4life
Beyoncé knowles are you married to Jay-z and a mother to 3 children
I love your Michigan I love it so much
Awesome
I am a real country girl and that is not a video
This isn't even a good video she does the same thing over and over
Sweet, sweet, sweet home, California California hotel song is smelling Colitas rising to the air
This song is not country
Love it keep up the great work
This video is disgusting making a mockory of country music
What’s the point of the repeat video?
After listing to it all the way,I’m not really feeling it 😐
Garbage
Listen to what you want but please do not bring the swearing "B" and "F" word and everything else in other music genre's that are offensive to most everyday people.  Country does not represent classless, tawdry and inappropriate words and actions. Country  is a genre of music that has deep deep roots in  Negro spirituals, gospel, folk tales & folk songs & traditions. Music evolves. I get that but it is disrespecful to bring country music down to match other morally offensive music? Hearing how some music has evolved makes my ears bleed.  Why do you want to lower yourself and your talent for low class shock value?
Who’s here after the announcement of her Country music album 😂❤️💪🏾 we about to really be hated ❤😂
Creepy.
You guys really take this seriously?!? To me it sounds like she's making fun of country music. And I don't even like country music 😂
Beyoncé me and my family are your biggest fans and we went to you Atlanta night 1 concert ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NO SHADE... but this sounds like a song you’d hear on a Walmart commercial to save on jeans this Summer for the entire family. 😬
Shew ….. not her genre at all, either she put this out to make fun or is desperate for money
I'm not a prude, but I am so tired of female artists feeling the need to display their boobs or @ss. Just sing.
Where’s her shirt…
As a Swede i love this song and almost did a Texas style Riverdance to the song
Gesundheit.
WHAT IS SHE WEAR THIS IS YOUTUBE SHE CANT BE DOING NO BOUCY DEAKY HOUSE???
Saw TikTok videos and came here for original.. disappointed
Best pop song released in years
Her music video is so boring but the song is great
Worst and most unimaginative video EVER!!! - so disappointed.
Garbage.
One wind blow and it’s over
This is the biggest pile of “country” shit I’ve ever heard in my life.
The real song is talk is cheap. If you know 😉
So, it’s just a video of her throwing up the Baphomet hand sign for 4 mins….
Weren't you the Church Sacutary?
Do not get thai clip ??? What hell going on
Zzzzzzz
Sounds good,  it's got a country sound to it. Good work.
This is not a country song
this dance is so good i love country you did so good beyonce
This ain't a nudist beach either. 😅
Sounds like a good song for duct tape ad. With her jacket sticking like that and the lyrics about "Stick around..."
The outfit is cute. Video sucks. I still love her, but I don't need to see her do the same thing 20 billion times!!!!
This is no country music 😒
This song fucking SUCKS!!!!!
Stupid video and song
This is the worst video I've ever seen. Like is this sh@t for real? 😂😂
Boomer here... lawdy i did not need to see all that ( as i laugh at my smalls ) The controversy has been everywhere. Enjoyed the lyrics.  Free to bee i rekon!!
Bruv ur showing inappropriate stuff-
Why is she half naked?..
Continue music has went to hell
Worst song ever
Oh gross, I’m sorry but you don’t need to be basically naked. Even if it is a nice body, which here is. This song is NOT country. This is some weird ass AI wanna be who needs to show some respect for REAL country music where we let our faith, kindness and strength speak for us instead of our nakedness. Plus we generally don’t use cuss words. This video is nothing more than  a disrespectful attempt at a “country” song. Nope! Pass! And for the record, I generally and genuinely like Beyoncé and her music! But this is not cool.
What a poor video
This is straight ASS
Well, now I see what everyone is bitching about. She's trying to whore up country music.
...made you look...
Worst choice for vizualiser
Shes about as much country as Marvin gayy.. just show your body
I love you so much I love your 🎵 ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
Just fantastic epic ,best ive heard in a long time such a great artist  sings this so perfect well done for great sing
This is a catchy song
Kudos from Bristol Tennessee Girl! Love this 🤠🤠🤠
Would love to see her and Dolly Parton doing a duet of this wearing identical outfits.
This is giving terminator vibes to me….
Way to make country sleezy
Nope
Song is ok but the video is really stupid going to half dress then use my fingers as a gun 😂 sorry but video could have used some work. She has used more energy in worse Songs
❤❤❤
Arthur Morgan would booze to this.
this old ass demon lady
Absolut ❤❤❤❤😊😉💯💋
Stupidest video I have ever seen. She does the same thing over and over again.
This is AWFUL
BEYONCE OLD NOW.  ...
et plus a poil c'est possible....
This ain't country. The video is more like soft porn.
Beyoncé’s Parents, uncles, aunts, cousins :  🧐🧐🥸🥸🫣🫣🫣🫣
This music video is not good. I like the song though, and I don't normally like Beyonce songs.
The wrong voice for this song😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
🎶 This ain't Texas. Ain't no hold 'em music 🎶                       Song is LITERALLY called Texas Hold 'Em
It’s definitely number one. Number one worse song I’ve ever heard
She pulled a reverse Taylor cyrus
Why half naked silly outfit
put some sugar on my honey...lol...d song do me things...jeez, by, great 1...bravo!
amamzing song got it stck in my head
This video sucks just saying. Song is okish but really the same thing on repeat makes for a boring video no matter how good you look.
im all in...ill wont fold ...so...d bch hit it out of bounds...im a believer now
Terrible
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS ? You must choose good words... example for Kids for youngs  what you teach people? I HOPE GOD OPEN YOU R MIND AND HEART.AMEN
It's amazing how she has to be half naked to keep us here lol..
This gives me 2000s vibes.  Edit: What why do I have 54 likes thank you Edit: okay I only said the song gives me 2000s vibes but thanks I love you all Edit: thank u so much <3
What????
She just copy  LyL Nass X ................... but anyway her boobs are cool
Hot garbage...she's just trying to take advantage of people.
Disgusting
WTF did I hear and see! OMG! It’s like hearing someone at midnight after a few drinks. I’m confused about the visual on this song. Really? Disgusting
Tf is this garbage
This ain't country.
Muted
No because The song: 🔥 The video:💀 The outfit:😵
She said don’t piss me off or I’ll make a whole album 😂😂😂
garbage
🙏✨ WHAT TRASH!! WHAT IS THIS NOT WEARING CLOTHES BEYONCE!! A REALLY GOOD WAY TO TEACH YOUR KIDS. JAY BE SMART, GET OUT OF THERE AND FIND A REAL WOMAN, ONE WITH CLASS, ONE THAT WEARS CLOTHES!!!✨👎
Charlie pride had 31 number one singles. It's complete bullshit that Country is it has been racist. That's all Democrat propaganda.
This doesn't even sound like Country music outside of the guitar
Hot garbage. Hand over your Texan card 🤦🏻‍♂️
This song is good but the drums are way too pronounced for a country song. Country music is traditionally very light on percussion. I know the modern stuff has gotten away from that with all the snap tracks but i think this has a more southern rock/blues vibe to it.
Tiktok is blazing Courtesy of you gal. 👏👏👏👏👏
Por um momento achei que está no replay o vídeo
Honestly what is the appeal? Additionally, the looping video doesn't even make sense.
😂 worst song ever stay away from country lady
Very uplifting thank u Jesus and followers
Alô Galera de Cowboy 🤠🇧🇷
so surprising love it
🙄  nope.
Why she doesn't want to release a videclip for her singles? Bow down this new concept, we want a video!
OK so it’s country music? Why in the hell is she wearing that? Can she be more country outside on the outcry not hip-hop we don’t need another bullshit.
she would be better wearing clothes
Good for her ,my modern-day Pointer Sisters cross over.❤
Taylor Swift is better though❤
Taylor Swift is better❤
God dayummmm does this song suck!
This song really isn’t that great. sounds so generic and cheap. she is definitely capable of putting in so much more into this song.
Bruh she got more trust in a stupid jacket than I have in a long skirt with no underwear!?…
First took over the movie's and now country music 😮
Terrible just stop
I thought I was being unreasonable but I wasn't. It's a no for me. 😂
She needs to have more clothes on no one wants to see that
This has to be the worst song I've ever heard
Anyone else think their turn signal is on when this song comes on in a Dodge?  There's a woodblock during the verse that sounds exactly like the clicking from your dashboard..
I like the song , but seriously the video is ridiculous. I have no desire to see her breasts or anything else. She could have made a great video with this song.
What a load of ....
This is gospel music, not country
i am a fan'
go gril🤩🤩🤩
you are the best
i love this song😍😍😍😍😍
Still sucks.
oh slay queen
Move over Olivia Odrago
disney movie end credits ahh song💀💀
This songs so bad it hurts
I love this song
Whats this music called
Dam you are a sexy cowgirl!
I love her song here but I was disappointed that she didn't do a dance with this. She has awesome dance moves.
Even someone as talented as Beyoncé feels she has to get basically naked in her videos. Shame.
The song is pretty good if I did not see this horrible video. To risky with the nude look.
Great song and Beyoncé's voice  but what a silly video 😵‍💫
This is shit! She should stay in her lane!
Queen 👑 ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. SUPERB, DANCED, HAD A GOOD NIGHT. SHE KILLED THIS. MUCH LOVE 💗🙏🏽😉💯
she is a texan am I right about that
Lay your cards down down  Love you queen from Nepal
These videos for the new album are a waste of time. Somebody is fired because these instant replays ain't it, Chief.
I learned today that this song was by B. Amazing!
Absolutely not
La chanson est magnifique mais la vidéo est nulle. Surprenant 😮
Remind me of young sheldon ❤❤
👎
We’re in. Love this.
nope
this isnt country but its a decent song
Fuck this song sucks
I will die to see you 😂❤
I told myself that I'd give it a lesson. It's okay... but I'll just stick to classic country.
Thus song sucks. Stop preparing
Amazing song, real vibe ❤ very boring music clip visually yes she's got amazing body Beyonce is stunning but I was waiting for something to change the whole film clip but was disappointed LOL
Not gonna lie Bey you did that❤
Damn, I would have never guessed you can park a lexus in a country song 😅
I HATE this fucking song
i Love you girl
Has anyone told B she is a gest in this country shit? Just as eminem is a gest in hip hop? Hahaha people are fucked she smashed this country shit just as em smashed hip hop. Fuck skin colour. Nothing but love ❤️
Beyoncé: I only have 10 seconds to do this video.  Producer: No problem.
Bro your music videos are trash 🗑
Why is she naked and cussing in the song? Tacky.
This song is addicting and it' stays on my mind
u don't need to express your sexuality like a slag
very sorry u had to be half nude
New world order country is 💩
This was not the outfit I expected her to be wearing ... first time seeing this, obviously ...
Name of the song : Texas hold'em Lyrics : This "ain't Texas so don't hold' em   😂😂 stupid celebrities
Awesome,this IS authentic ❤❤❤👌👌
This is a repead
Honestly idk why this is popular
Default ghetto swearing duly noted. Decent but forgettable.
She ripped off Kenny Rogers 'the gambler' same song. How lame girl. Stealing an old man's song,
Black people shouldn't white wash their skin.  SHE WAS   BLACK BLACK IN DESTINY'S CHILD.  UMM K.. THIS IS DISCUSTING AND RASCIST.   YOU'RE NOT WHITE MAN B
Lmao no man no .  Please don't reveal your penis this time 😢  scary 😊
What's the point of even wearing the jacket?? LOL
THIS AINT TEXAS !! 🤣🙂🤣
Omg that’s HORRIBLE!
*Every white girl when they say they listen to Beyoncé*
Yu still So Weird AF..But this Song is so Great 🌙😇🔥💜 Just FYI Always Loved Your work QB 👑👑🍎🍎🩸🩸🌹🌹💖😍✌️💜
Why is pornography allowed on youtube? Put some clothes on and have some decency. Also go back to hip hop. This isn't country.
Love The Song n Voice n Powerful Song With GREAT MEANING TOO💥💥💯💯💯💜💜💜💜💖👌🏿👍🏽💕🌀✨💮🌸🏵️💫⚡💥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The laziest music video ever 😂 The same 12 seconds on repeat. The song is catchy though.
The song and lyrics have a very good beat. But, we wish the video was just a little more country, maybe do some line dancing.
Lainey Wilson better to
As a Texan, I’m offended.😭
Look at what happened to Brazil when they tried mocking my father every one seen what y'all were doing at the super bowl
Trash!
Jesus is real the proof is simple search up oasis river
🙄🙄🙄
Hey Taylor swift is amazing who agrees with me
The f*** is this?  a cyborg
THIS IS 💩💩💩
this is so weird lol
This ain’t country, so move on over, go put your clothes back on on on
No👎
Took me a month but now I am in love with this SONG!!! #countrygirl
❤❤💪🏾💪🏾 GO BAE!!
I like the song and the beat to it, but honestly are some of those curse words "really" necessary for the song ?  🙄🙄
She stole this beat from Franklin the turtle.
Mam, please put some clothes on 😂
woo
Stupidest video ever
Hey Bo Duke... It's number one on the charts! How many number one hits have you had? Zilch. So shut up about Beyonce!
Tiktoc
Frick you beyonce, stay in your lane. You already broke up destiny’s child. You gone and fricked up country.
I love this song
Esse é o clip mais facil que ela deve ter feito kkkkkkk  Easiest videoclip she ever made hahahha
Damn only 20 mil in a month? That’s all Beyoncé gets these days
Would even be great if she put in some dance moves🎉
this shi aint even country and yall think it’s the best “country” song
Cultural appropria...  oops I got distracted
Tooooo young      Where is yo mama at ?????
Just as 16 CARRIAGES this TEXAS HOLD EM Video repeats. I became bored and annoyed extremely fast. I'M  DISAPPOINTED 😞. Song is Good but I EXPECTED it to be Great as her past songs have been known for.
I like queen bee. Old school.but a lexus in a country song . seems like pop music trying to sound country. No soul in this. Anthony oliver had soul in his song that cost nothing to make
Put on  a shirt
No
No offense but when this comes on my radio I have to turn it off some of the lyrics are kind of an insult, there’s a tornado in my city hit the basement that s*** ain’t pretty you think country is tornadoes and hitting the basement? And going to the bar afterwards after everything got destroyed? I don’t know maybe I’m just being 2024 but that s*** is ridiculous
There’s nothing about this that is consistent with country music. Country women have more respect than to strut around with their bodies hanging out. I’ll pass.
I’m in love with this now🎉
this ain't shania twain👎
Gun violence at a sexual impression
Why is this a country song? because it has a guitar and a clap beat? This aint country 😂
🔥 🗑
Das ist der erste Song seit Ewigkeiten der mir wirklich Glücksgefühle macht
I SEE HER BOOBS
She doesn't need the jacket. My question is, why the jacket??
This ain’t country…. Charlie Crockett for president!!!!
Stick to your genre and leave country alone
No need to show so many skins
AWFUL.
It's a very nice pop song.  If she can come up with something better (and with more soul) I may be able to consider it decent country music.
So glad 20 writers built Beyoncé a county song
Dumbest video ever
Only thing a little country is the beat. She can’t sing country
Unpopular opinion but not impressed
Wow, was ein schlechtes Video und der Song …. Noch schlechter geht nicht mehr …
Absolute Royal Flush if it was Texas hold ‘em 😏
This is not country
This Shit Sucks, Keep Country White
AFRO/BLACK FAMILY,EACH SPECIES IS ENDOWED WITH A  TYPE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR SURVIVAL AND PROCREATION,FROM VIRUSES/BACTERIA TO INSECTS WERE A BRAIN IS NOT REQUIRED ,BUT 😂 FOR COGNITIVE THINKING A BRAIN IS REQUIRED
10/10 song ... 1/10 video..
Why bother with clothes any more.. you have shown the world your goods ..have some respect for yourself for crying out loud.  And the song is crap.
I got ready to watch an incredible video. Same 10 seconds on repeat. I even tried to find the nuance within those sessions on repeat. None. Disappointing
Hell no
🤢🤮
Hoy día todo lo hacen enseñando parece que no pueden hacer su trabajo con solo su talento promoviendo todo el desastre que hay hoy tantas mujeres vendiéndose por dios
I love this song on 24/7 🎉🎉
She has more trust in that shirt then I do in my self💀
Okay I don't get the outfit, why is every singer as they age need to show more of their flesh are they that insecure?   A era of don't subjectify me, but YET?
So ai then yea, feeding off Tracey and Luke
So trashy
Cultural appropriation???
Yep. Just as much country as anything else on country radio today.
I like Beyoncé but this is not county
Sux
This song is the light version of Tracy Chapman's number "safe us all"
This literally had drugs infused cz im hooked and can’t stop 😅
Forgive me BEY! Daddy lessons my first crush! Texas hold'em my second! Diva for me since Dangerlous in love! I love you QUEEN BEY!🥰😍🥰😍😘😘I hope I have the honor of watching it up close!
Prefiero a tu prima Kelly rowland  mil veces 😅😅😅😅
Who’s favorite singer is Beyonce
This shet ain’t country nor country pop tf is a country pop
Love this song I was hoping there would be back up dances dropping it like it is hot where it says hoedown. Absolutely love the song
Last night we let the liquor talk I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet No way it was our last night
20 M  hahahahahaha😂
TITS!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Go girl❤
She wouldn't know county if it rose up and kicked her in her ass is takes more than some research a hat and using the slang yall and this video is stupid as fuck
Surprised that Beyoncé is putting out more country stuff. Reminds me of that Lady Gaga album Joanne, where Lady Gaga tried to write more country flavored songs, most of which didn’t suit her very well.
One of the worst songs ever made
phewwww ... what i can say she is older than me still and 4 ever
Amazing song but videos terrible I'd  of loved texas men and women dancing something fun 😂
Well, this video sucks!!!
💯💯💯🗑️
This song sucks plain and simple…no where near a country song it’s trash stick to what your good at
Mother 😭😭😭😭
The song would get a lot more fans if she could reign in her inner ho.
☑️☑️🗳️🗳️🗳️☑️
plz remove this song
Мега тъпият клип
Nice❤
I don't like the song too much. And I love country music. The video as well. As American Idol says; it's a no for me.
🤮
Hacía casi una década que no lograba un éxito así tan bueno 💯🔝🎤🎶🔟
The Franklin theme song, haven't heard that since I been a kid.
So... is country popular now or something?
Bro what is that outfit
Really vad. Put your clothes on girl. You dont need to take them of to be a start. Our young girls need to know they dont need to take their clothes of to be stars.
What a joke... What a dirtbag.  That's some innovative choreographer, such a smash of eclectic moves and even a plot ! Ridiculous
Why is it just the same thing over and over
Lottally same al way through want her best
You come out in some lingerie and shoot a pistol? What kind of video is that who er?
I was waiting for her to do something else 🙄.
I hated the song when I heard it the first couple of times, but it grew on me after hearing it all over social media
Its all over. The WORLD
Amen!
Ew beyonce I like taylor swift more❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ain't nothing about this song country lol
Flaccid.
Pure garbage
Madonna did better approach to country music- without big tits… https://youtu.be/gLFWRDsx5AI?si=peIdxJ_2LfwVNVOq
totally awesome
Good job illuminati. The 1 eye covered crap is getting old.
Sounds good but it sounds too much like the theme song from Franklin😅
The outfit was definitely an idea😂
Come on Beyoncé you got this it’s time for a country vibes. I really don’t like country music, but she broke my head.
I love the song but not the video. It doesn't relay to the song at all.
Song is good . This video is to Trashy, have class.
Garbage
Taylor Swift Rapped like 14 years ago and that is the opposite of this
Vaya video más soso y feo , Beyoncé  esperaba más de ti , aburres mucho.
Nope! I'm not feeling this song...at all!!
?????? Ese es el video ?
Bro I hate this, she’s over here thinking that she’s country when she is not. Don’t get me wrong she good in her original genre and think she should stay there and stop pissing of real Country boys.
Not a big Beyonce fan, but dammmmm, this is a catchy tune!
Not country. A lame effort. Of course, most of the new stuff out there right now  isn't either.
❤❤❤
So nice for her style but this is not country this is not the type of country that I grew up listening to or the type of country that I want to listen to and that shirt oh my God I don't know how you got that shirt to stay in place did you glue it or secure it somehow because I definitely would have been scared that my little toddies would fall out and that's not really a country outfit either so I don't know what she's doing here but good luck to you
Give Creds omg..
We ❤️ you
C’est obligé la tenue de prostituée ??
Nope.
girll you need to put on some clothes 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh lordy. If stay in your lane was a song...... 😂 Never used to these mamas being naked knowing their kids will see these videos and pictures one days.
Lame
This song sucks!
Why do artist feel the need to bare everything.  I'd have more respect for her if she had a really sharp country outfit on that represented TEXAS and not trash.  She's such a FANTASTIC singer, she doesn't need to show all.
She got some big bills to pay all about the money. If you don’t like it, don’t buy it
_"She ain't American enough"_ to be considered country. Just come out and say *I'm a racist* already.
I dont know why, and never will know: why married woman, having two children shows her boobs🤷🏻‍♀️
Well you know it sounds as country as anything on country radio these days to me it does. I guess they don’t like her voice or something. I bet Beyoncé likes to line dance. #countrymusic
Gone Girl❤
Dumbest video ever
so disappointed
Never been a fan of beyoncè... but this is one of the best songs I have ever heard
Never been a fan of beyoncè... but this is one of the best songs I have ever heard
La mejor canción de su carrera
What's for JESUS?
what's with this video - its got to the worst?!!
u are a queen, not a pole dancer
Why u think u have to show ur body
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jay z should  give her more three kids build  a empire if is a wiser man
you're A Lettuce please pin
She is the best
lol what a joke go away Beyoncé this isn’t country and go back to hip hop or whatever u sing not a fan
This song is such garbage as is this person
So who told her this was a good idea? Cause this is literal shit 😂 I think she honestly ruined her self and country music with this raunchy ass song
🌹🥹😂🥰👈🤠👍2024🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is the very first “County Song” I’ve ever liked…and, I live IN Texas !  Bring it to us, girl…
Awesome!
Put a fricking shirt on
Bro, need to get back to hop
Wow this music video is profound.  The song sucks
Country music said; NO! THIS ISNT A RETIREMENT PLAN FOR WASHED UP HIP HOPPERS.
this shit sucks lol wtf
Lyrics are horrible. Just regurgitating country words with no context.
Does not represent Texas or country music!!!
This is the stupidest video I have ever seen
☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆☆ ☆
Slayyyy beautiful precious group of Far west Keep always the same good mood into your performance of danse be careful of you're Texa's contry♥️♥️ i'm not from Texas yet but if I have a dollard for every time I've heard this song today so after a month or years when someone likes it and enjoyed my comments if I have a dollard for me you represent Everythings than all the dollard that I need to make my daily life happy🏆♥️♥️
Before I saw this, I visualised her in boots and cut down denim shorts far too small for her, how wrong I was.
Trash 🗑
Beyoncé 🎉🎉🎉
Wow, her sound is REALLY suited for country! How fun! Who knew?  But leave the costuming back in the other pop genre. Country is about real life Beyonce...Your voice makes "normal" awesome! Don't need the skin and costume shocks....LIFE, FAMILY, LOVE, PEOPLE's Stories... Come on over and live normal girl!  You got this...what a chance for you! Go! Baby!
This is still WAY better than anything Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line or Blake Shelton has made in a decade.
Well not sure what to say about this one.
J'ai juré le l'intro ils ont copié le générique de Franklin la tortue.
Stay in your lane Beyonce. You're not Taylor Swift.
This isn't country this is fucking stupid
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME MY BEST COUNTRY SONG EVER! (And I say that as a huge Charley Pride fan). Thank you for also making country great again for my generation. I couldn't stomach country for a hot minute there this millennium. Thank you for making this album Queen Bey! ❤❤❤
0:13 0:12
She has more trust in that shirt then I have in my life 😢
I thought she was gonna do some texans steps
Yuck!  Boring song and monotonous video.  Don’t understand the attraction.
She has more trust in that vest jacket than I ever have in my life
This song is amazing. But I don't understand why she has to be half naked to sing it?
Worst song I have ever heard soo sad😢
Sorry Jay Z. But Beyonce and Country music? Not feeling it. Kacey Musgraves, Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert and others, have paid their dues, in country. Those songs are rich in country struggles life and loves, much like hiphop, and R&B. Country music is sacred. So out of respect, you shouldn't cross genres. Then again, if you're cool with Taylor Swift hiring Pharrell, to produce funk tracks she sings on black radio, I guess you can call that progress, too. Right?
All I hear is Franklin the Turtles theme song lol
Good song, shit video!!
Give up!!
Very nice Love the song.native Alabamian.❤😊
Beyoncé is the most Powerful Artist on this Planet. The Strongest and Most Famous Singer, Dresser, Performer, Most watched Videos and has the Most Fans, oh and the Most Powerful People on this Planet is Black 👏🏼❤✨🌹
Leave country music and NEVER come back. We like what we have and You are not welcome.
I'm a Bee fan & I listen to the country artist but this song sucks sorry
This is the first song she's released, I don't like. Imagine Black's doin' a 'Hoe Down'... Ninja, please! If you gon' be country... be country; just stop flopping around like a fish outta water. The video is like an ad for a "Bar-B-Que Porn Shop".   Peace
I don’t like her or her song! She’s not country.. sorry not sorry.. this song sucks
not the photoshop boobs video 🤣🤣🤣🤣 why embarrass yourself like this
You Are amazing ❤ Amazing 💗 Thank You Jesus
Anyone else want to hear a Taylor Swift and Beyonce song or an album with both of these artists? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥
The song :😁🤠 The clothes :😐
Why that vest??
Taylor ain't got all dat💜💛💚
TRAAAAASSSSSHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Are you kidding Beyoncé and people who are in favor of almost nude with fingers between breasts and calling “don’t be a bitch”over and over. This is a satire on country square dances! Bad for our children to emulate Beyoncé   Go home and do this dance in front of your daughter over and over Beyoncé!
This comes nowhere close to country music.
.... well that was self deprecating 🃏
The Renaissance of country.
This song makes Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Achy Breaky Heart” look like solid gold. Seriously, one of the most trite, insipid songs I’ve ever had the misfortune to come across.
😂absolutely rubbish 😅
The trust in that jacket 😅
The californians that moved to texas enjoy this garbage song 😂🤡🤡🤡🤡  keep the californians OUT of texas! We dont want your corrupt BS in the deep red south! MAGA
Worst video I've ever seen, Beyonce! Great song though. C"mon, you can make a tter video than repeating touching your breasts  then shooting over and over! That was really surprising to me. Bad promotion!
This one sucks.Also her outfit is too much.
This is absolute shit
Garbage can
Such garbage
Ew u half nacked
Ehh
And too much profanity
I like the song , but too much boobs
FREAKING KNEE IT...!!! I told my hubby that she would be amazing in country music ..instead of that stuff she's sings now
Bizarre...she is not a country singer...this video is porn basically.  Can a singer dress and not cuss in a song ?  Just a dumb song that is meant for mocking.
Beyoncé just nail all she touches❤❤
Tell me you're a sell out without telling me you're a sellout
Porn texas country music. Pfffff
Being original is quite hard when you learn to copy, specially #1 https://youtube.com/shorts/XgCcTnJBw5c?si=wxHdl-NZI7Nx-8HD
Is it over yet
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not a Beyonce fan but I do like this song
I heard this on the radio I didn't know it was Jack's Harlows great song especially the sample part.
Hey I'm cool with the song but this video is frackng stupid.
This song is unlistenable.
I can't wait to meet Texan people.
Classic Line: "Don't Be a Bitch, Come take it to the floor now"
No class. And def NOT COUNTRY
Sza is wayyy better but this song is a banger😂
This is the shittest thing I’ve seen on YouTube
Kicking.   Sigh.  Kicking down fences!  Omg
This is Texas: Nice job!  This is amazing💫💫💫Keep up the great work on musically conquering every musical single type there is.  You are  licking down fences, lady!!!  Big hug friend m Texas ❤️🤍💙
Videoclip it's not so good 😂but ok
Well, when your video has to show you half naked and ain’t nothing country about this song👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 stay where you belong Beyoncé
Iuh
Betch SLAy goddess ! Faaaaaa the haters godesssssssssss👊🏽🤘🏽👊🏽🤘🏽
Queen y3
What the f*ck is this No-one  talking about her showing her boobs
I. Hi there Beyonce!    II. Love this song. Thx for its authenticy and creativity.    III. Allow me also to say this. I hope it won't hurt you as well.      3.1. In fact, I've in mind the story within Taylor Swift, Kanye West and You during the Grammy Music Awards......     3.2. I simply would like to say that I'm big fan of Country Music. And also in the same time, I'm a big fan of Taylor Swift. Recently, I was very happy and proud of her when she has been picked by Time as PERSON OF THE YEAR. I told her that SHE IS BECOME THE PERSON OF THE CENTURY BECAUSE SHE HAS INTRODUCED AN INNOVATION IN MUSIC.     She has introduced the MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN MUSIC. Not only she was performing in Country Music but also she has been able to become Pop Star and perform in it.      Generally speaking, it's very difficult to do so.      IV. Now, I've the feeling that there's a CONTAGION EFFECT OF TAYLOR SWIFT. In fact, you (Beyonce), you were a superstar of R&B and Pop.  I also heard that you were a choregrapher of Michael Jackson like Usher in the past. And now, you made this song (Texas Hold ' EM) which is a country song.     V. I'm also happy that it's about Texas. The country music has a bright future. I'm sure that the mix of rural and urban musics will become a trend.    VI. I also pay attention to the context and time of the song: March 8 , Women Day and March 10, Mother's Day.         I'm focusing on the Female's 21st century.          Generally speaking, many people believe that the worst ennemy of female is female.          I'm sure that we'll show to all they are wrong.
Thats not country
Do the girls in Texas wear clothes like that
This is trash. Her raps are trash too...go back to singing
Please 🥺 don't put that kind of clip. Too much nightmare. The music melody ok. But...
Actually, fun music!! Thanks!
I meeeeaaan i guess 🤷‍♂️
Taylor tem seu valor, mas ganhar da bey chega ser ofensa
Máquina de fazer hit
This scene does not match the song... The song is upbeat and cheerful yet the scenery is dark! Makes no sense... I could see this playing at Texas Roadhouse 😆
Its a song. That's about it.
How does she get her nipples to not slip out?😶
Reminds me of the song off Hannah Montana movie, still I like it
Goosebumps🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
Rubbish.
Always saying that people seeing women as a lustobject blablabla… meanwhile half naked in her clips.. jackass hypocrite
She should not have made this one  3:48
Great tune, the video could have gone tit's up multiple time's 😂,
PLEASE GO ON TOUR WITH THE CHICKS TO SHOWCASE THIS ALBUM.  Itd be awesome to see yall all together.  The new Fantastic Four. Beyonce and The Chicks.
Lmfao first time watching this and i thought WTF she taking the piss outta dem tikatokas people this video hella funny😂😂😂😂
i looked up this video for 2 reasons.
Artist my arse. Would of been a good tune but she insists on swearing, disgusting
Trash
garbage
This is the worst sound that I've ever heard of my life time go back to R&B please.
This is actually fire
Most boring video EVA
What a boring video 😢😥🙆🙄
no.... just... now
Is this the video..... I was expecting a bit more
Not country but its a Beyonce song.  Don't think the real country fans can embrace this but its a cute song
Bro this was made 1 month ago
Good ol Beyonce...making her music rounds. Getting a piece of all the pies😏
In Latin America people don't know about the Black Caw Boys because in the movies there were only white Caw Boys but the reality is different, the producers of the film were white, but most of the Caw Boys were blacks who moved the cattle in troops,farmers too , on youtube can see 😀😅🤣😇
This is not country it never will be this is fake country
This goes hard on mute
A cheap low budget video for A song that suck.
No she needs to stay r&b she has a hip hop r&b voice so not country some have what it takes and some don't she just not country
Great song. Really dissappointed that is the only thing those millionaires could come up with for a video.
It's funny that she wants to emulate a genre of people who have enslaved her and her bazillionaire husband
I have never heard it on the contry radio in my area. I guys the radio stations near me just have better judgment. Other than the song being crap the video is trashy.!
I like the song. But dang put a shirt on !
The fact that this song is on SiriusXM the highway is absolutely embarrassing. Keep this shit on the pop station 😂
Que 3stupld3s
Didn’t she used to be black?
Every time I hear this song I’m gonna remember this  video 💀
Another underrated channel
The most country thing about this is the banjo.
MISS GIRL COVER UP
It's natural talent!😍😍😍
Garbage
Most boring music video I have ever seen
People who notice that it is the same video over and over
I think I lost a few brain cells watching this video. I think I’m going to go read a novel now
This is fucking shit wth lmao what a fucking joke
Sugar and licker is crazy 🎉
Lmao wtf is this trash
The lyrics where definitely generated by an A.I.
Is my first time watching this
Where's T-Pain country songs?
This is fucking dumb and it at no country music!
I don't see the cowgirl outfit... Where are her boots? However, I really like the song!
This shit is not country
100 OVER 100
I'm liking this Beyonce new get up this is my first time hearing it and I like it❤❤😊
Beyonce, wear clothes.
One eyed symbolism
I'm not impressed with the song or video, so put some damn clothes on. 😂😂
I sacrificed a view just to come on here and say this song is trash and it’s annoying and she should go back to making r&b cause this ain’t it
She does not have a clue on how to sing country it sounds exactly like a pile of s***
i loveeee
well, you forgot your bra and pants. nice try though
Wait. THIS is her video for this popular song? Good Grief!
Im not one for country, and I'm from Texas but Beyonce always slaps.
Absolutely not, this shit is garbage!! She got her tune from Franklin, she can't even come up with anything of her own, so she has to take it from a shows theme song.
Love it 😍
We need the dance now. I can’t wait. If it’s there already please send link. Please and thank you!!
🔫de e o seu nome do início do ano antes do início do ano antes do início do ano antes do início do ano antes do início do ano
I hate this song with a passion. Hearing it on the radio at work is the worse. I cant stand all the woo hoos and heys! In this song. Cringe fest as usual
When I hear this song it reminds me of the hey it’s Franklin theme
Nasty, like gross
Is that all she does in the video 😂😂😂😂😂
I hate it
Thanks Beyonce for making one the most annoying songs ever fck u all the way from texas
I haven’t met a Texan yet that thinks this is good, every one of us hates it
She's nacked
Why she have to pretend to be a porn star for a music video
This is closer to a kneegrow spiritual then a country song 😮😂😊
OMG Hollywood! Don't remake Urban Cowboy! First time around cut me deep!
I like the song more than her ❤❤❤
Most real country songs don’t need clean/edited versions; they’re already that way.
She got really fat ..WOw why ..now her legs are so fat ..
#40....quick she better try and make another hit....see how easy this song faded away
Not a fan!! Tacky video.
Where in the hell are people getting the dumb dance from this is embarrassing
Garbage
Why is she dressed like that? Looks like she's trying to sell sex than music.  Uncalled for.
I hate this song so much like stop stay in your genre and leave the country genre to the country artists
❤❤ thanks 😊
Omg that was the worst crap I ever heard. She needs to be stopped
Laaawwddd she got a body Ajax can't take off 😁
Mi fa schifo questa canzone 😢
People think she shouldn't be singing country music
😮😮😮
So, she got so poor, that she had to use the same short clip, to make an entire video?
Ok no. The tune isn’t even country and she ripped off The Gambler. Girl you’re a pop singer. No this ain’t country.
Get clothes
Overrated trash song.
three minutes and 37 seconds wasted watching Playboy instead of the art of "music".. music is been destroyed.
Mmmmm yea … no
This song is dog shit
Well that sounds like pure shit. Nothing about this is correct to being ‘country’, but the falsettos are NOT right technique for what she’s trying.   Also, this is the equivalent of taking a can of spaghetti’o and dumping it hoping to make words out of it. She took a bunch of associated words with this modern bro country and then scrambled them around.   REAL country is storytelling and 50% Blues. A root music of black people. Making garbage like this should never have happened.  That would be like me trying to make a rap/hip-hop song using a generic beat, saying n****, gat, smokin, gang gang, skrt, and other over used words in rap.   It’s disrespect and bullshit. Try again Beyoncé. Your irrelevance is showing.
Btw I make up half the views this video has 😂😂😂
This song is straight garbage🤮🤮🤮 anti-texan         Trump 2024 🇺🇸
Beautiful song, beautiful voice, but I don’t know why she walking down the street flashing her boobs like that 😂
This video would be better if she would actually do more than walking and shooting a finger gun
Outside of US no one cares about country music. Now a black international star is doing this.. and I love it.  Greetings from Austria, Europe
Wear a bra
Se me hace similiar a otra cancion y no l rrecuerdo cuál
Just came here to see what this stupid ass song is everyone’s talking bout.   I was right.   It’s trash.
Quit trying to be country
Just dance and their clothes are inappropriate put some put a shirt on
Ok but what is up with the nearly naked outfit. Not a good look bounce😂
I keep hearing this song 😭🙏
♥️♥️
I'm just finding out that beyonce was the artist for this song! Didn't recognize her voice in the country style
Those boos are huge
Divaaa lindaaaa
I usually like Beyonce but this video is annoying to some extent because of the repetition of the same clip. 😊
Wtf is she wearing
great song but she is horrible
nope does nothing or me...just trashy
First Rock, then Pop now Country. IFYKYK
That outfit is innoprpitte for kids to be watching
The dumbest video ever
No just no please no please god no
She doesn't seem to have a nipple does she?
Shite
This melody just seems like a Tracy Chapman remake
Not loving it
Anyone think she's a spurs fan 3:23
Brasil is in love with this song  🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️❤ #BeyonceDiva
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has dropped 1 spot to #6 for its 5th week on the Billboard Hot 100! Keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! The album drops in 9 days! 👑🐝
😂😂0😊😊
😂😂0😊😊
Country song? Sounds forced. Good try though.
🤨ay0- 🍒🍒
Oh Dear.
I gotta say this has got to be the worst and most obnoxious song and trend dance I’ve ever seen in my life.  I wish a wasn’t born for this exact moment.   Who showed her this idea?! Hey so we gone put boots with this “ shirt “ and some lingerie and you gone sing about Texas and cards and we gone call it country music 🤠.  God kill me, also not ganna talk about her eye!?   Oh yeah I forgot yall are still blind.
Beyoncé Thanks for helping me find my school dance song 😁
That's ain't country !!! Bye-bye.  Stay in the pop music and don't pollute country music.
So you have to get half naked to sing a country song?
wow i actually like a country song. queen b 🔥🔥🔥
Brasil?? 🇧🇷
Media is keeping Rihannon Giddins off the radar. "It's not country." One of the best banjo players cannot be divulged to the pleebs.
That’s 1:14 minutes of my life I’ll never get back 🤦🏻‍♀️
AI ELA TA MTO TELEPHONE PART 2
Queen B delivered another beautiful baby out the hive again! ❤
Aint a fuckin thing country bout this trash 😅
Awesome love it 🥰
19,919,999 views
If my job was to count how many times l have heard this song my salary would be $80   BEY MY DOLLAR
Absolute rubbish!!!
This song is fucking stupid
Where’s your boots and clothes?
Is this the official video...( Jeeze at least Madonna had a proper video when she went country )
Tired of black artists appropriating white culture
i really enjoy this, i have some poetry if you are interested
Wow! waxani hees waa dhaaftay
it ain't old school/but it sounds real good you go girl;'''
Trash 🗑️
I fucking love it!!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I came here after all the backlash and I actually like it!❤😁🇺🇸
I listened to this song on Instagram these days a lot and I like it ❤ that's why I'm here to listen to this song
No part of it is country.
Esse é o clip original? Amei a música mas esperava mais do clip, se for esse o clip original, claro.
“This is not a country album. This is a Beyoncé album”
why is beyonces version of country giving adele so hard
😢one, put some damn clothes on, not everybody wanna see what j zee sees. Two, clean up the language. Otherwise great song
Nice throwaway tune.  Seriously, she could not afford a decent writer(s) and video director?  The video looks like that dancing baby screensaver.
Sad how singers, especially her, need to look like pornstars to sell a vid
The song I like but the video though is a different story she could have made it so much better
This ain't even country lol what an embarrassment
This isn't country. Put your clothes on Beyonce.
Why is this not cultural appropriation? Because she's black and black people can get away with fucking anything!!
is this video just looping all the time?
Yeh new song get me likes
Trash I'm sorry but she need to stay in her lane they think because they add a Banjo and some corny lyrics about Texas that its country lol its a no go
This is crap
Imagine if that's how you used your gun
OK. Admittedly, I had no idea who this was, but I heard her on a radio at work and figured I'd check it out. It's a nice cross over from R&B to countryish. Good job and nice vocals. The vest seems to be on a precarious perch. 🇺🇸⚔️🇬🇪
Guys we all know why we’re here.
All right class, what have we learned today? Well, some people's boobs and manicures have held up REAL well.
No connection between lyrics and the video as usual disgusting and filled with Satanic imagery. Beyonce is controlled industry puppet.
Unglaublich wie Menschen manipuliert sind🤦‍♀️.Wenn dieses langweiliges Lied eine unbekannte Person singen würde, hätte kein Mensch like gedruckt aber bei Beyonce finden alles gut🙄🤦‍♀️😂
Bey you took over the world with this song. Multiple cultural. This is what you call talent at it’s finest 🥰🥰
This isn’t country music
Why almost  naked  it s for a western or a en erotic movie🤭🤔🤣
Culture vulture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The song isn't bad. She could cover up a little bit more!
Where's the country in this song? Just sounds like another pop song trying to pretend to be country.
She doesn’t even do anything 😒this is boring
This is cultural appropriation.  You can’t have it both ways.   Cool song though.
I was looking for some cool dance moves but o well everyone else is making up one so cool! This video went over my head.
Nope don't like it. Sorry B it's a no for me and I typically love your music.
who else is 2 stepping
This stupid shit
It's definitely catchy
Trash
She doesn’t have nipples?!!😮
🎶This ain't country.... this is trash! Throw it out ,out ,out,out🎶
I told my sister to “hold please” while I pulled up a photo, and she replied “this ain’t Texas” “but I’ll hold” and I felt that someone would enjoy this😂
THIS AINT COUNTRY. THIS IS SHIT.FLUSH THIS ALBUM DOWN,DOWN,DOWN
this is not a real country song
move over Taylor Swift
Like ADELE Send my love
I guess she couldn’t handle Tracey Chapman having a country hit so she had to have one too…how petty
masterpiece ❤
Love to see all the old farm workers getting pressed at this at what I can how could even only just say a Cathy tune.
This was a L song ngl
Real legends are the one who recognized this song as Itaewon Class’ (k-drama) OST ‘Start over’ for the very first time listening to it.❤
Lucky YouTube removed downvotes
Man you ask Franklin for this sample
Goooo
Stay in your lane Beyonce, you musical parasite.
Certified TRASH
This song is on the wrong side of cack
Stupid song ? not country , fake black shit
What utter garbage...
Yall not listening to the words 🤯
Putain je kiff la musique mais mince je deteste le clip elle c p1s fait chier sérieux mais vraiment pas ...
She needs to stick to pop music this is awful
The Video is boring sorry
If you're reading this, this is your last reminder that God is real, Jesus died for your sins and is coming back to collect. None will be wrong in the Day of Judgment. REPENT. THE LAST DAYS ARE HERE.
Hey Beyonce, check out Molly Tuttle's cover on YouTube. She a Granmy winner too. How about collaboration with her in future??? One very talented artist is Molly.
I'm a musician old guy but we always looked at it like a person that can do different music weather in Bee country western classical Opera it's all music they're all musicians this is fantastic great job Beyonce
😊 it's really interesting to see someone else do meaning of black person the last group that I remember doing something was Lionel Richie and the Commodores Salem down the line
She is awesome and I like her taking a chance with this type of music shows her versatility
Great song don’t care for the video would have liked to see her dancing or something she’s so talented
Diddys law suit taken everyone  down even Jay Z got Beyonce turning country like she aint got nun to do with it 😂🤣🤣🤣
💖💖💖💞⚡
💕💞💕💞✨💖
Is that how Texas women’s dress up?😏😏 looks too cheap.
Freaking hilarious first we had Kanye West with the goofy outfit now we have beyoncé pathetic
😆🤣😂😅
dog shit song.
Wow, she's becoming just another follower... doing the naked thing for all the world to see.  She's lowered herself.. and made herself just like all the other attention seekers.  Horrible example for her daughters too...
I like the song, but not feeling the video… sorry, official visualizer. Whatever that means.
This is like a 2/10 for creativity, 3/10 for country lyrical consistency, 9/10 for having the BALLS to call this country music, and just 2/10 for being a sad waste of time to listen to. Got bored at 1:30 and paused. Horrible song
Hard
Expected to see western outfits and a row of dancers. WTF is this?
Beyoncé, girl put some clothes on.
Good song
This shit is so fucking ass😂
meh.
I'm not a fan of the song and the video is complete trash. I don't even get the point of spending the time to create it.
And the point is what?
beyonce ,what a sell out...a music artist from Houston,Texas.Selling a song this aint TEXAS.
This is genuinely the worst song I’ve ever listened to
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING  beyonce???  What the hell are you doing...  dont be pathetic....  be true to who you are ....
let me ask all of you fans.... watch halo video and then see this garbage ... you can see it...  u can see the difference .
!wtf>?>>>   look everyone !  we went from Halo to this garbage ... See if im wrong ...   this song is garbage....  fing garbage ... how low did we go
Kuntry but not Country, absolute garbage.
Just 19 mil views??? It should have ten times that.
Plagiarism
What the hell? Hollywood is so weak now.
If this is her video for the song, the video stinks. Song is good but the video is a stinker.
This ain’t no country song this is vulgar
Why is she hafe naked
This isn't "country"......this is "let's make a damn near porno and try to trigger people" video.  P.S. Beyonce, you ain't "all that".  GuaranTEED this video would get you laughed bright straight out of Texas!
Bro Beyoncé is so overrated
lol the ppl mad in these comments are cringe af. Not the best song I’ve ever heard but def not the worst I’ve ever heard either.  I’ll most likely never listen to this again cuz it’s not my thing, but whatev.  Everyone just live your lives, like what you like, dismiss the rest gracefully. 🙏🏻
All the videos of people dancing to this song are a million times better than this dumb video! So disappointing!!!
This song is ass
Song sucks and so does the video, put some damn clothes on!
🤪🤢 I can not stand this video ,what does  she think is country about dressing like a stripper? Can tolerate the song but can't watch  the video😢
carnival  >
"Come and pour some sugar honey on me TOO!" ❤️
Honestly I don't like it or get the hype about it.
Wish the music video was Yoncè as a Cowgirl 🤠
Why does this sound like that song i don't play video games no more😊
Well that ain't country is it. No, that wasn't a question.
Why is Beyoncé just like that?
Living in my head rent free ❤
Wow, they're really doing some amazing things with video production these days......
This YeeHaw'nce
I wonder who wrote her song for her or stolen it 😅. I am back so far I search it lol it says "Nathan Ferraro", helped her for this song
Love the song, is this the real video?
Worst crap I've heard in my life!!
Who let this woman butcher country music put some clothes on weirdo
Awful video, plus she looks tacky and sloppy. Ugly outfit. Song is good but video ... Bahhhh!!!
Gurl I think u forgot ur shirt
https://youtu.be/2E94TmOysEQ?si=77F-MvOIKJpaNqB2
So much prudes out there...
Take every single trope of a bang average ‘country’ song and put them together. Poisonous
Its kinda catchy, whats the beef with that song ?
What the fuck why is she not wearing a shirt?
No girl ur not country this song grossed me out 😂😂
Sickening how she's dressed and the song sucks.Thsts not country
Love the voice she has but I really wish she covered up little more
If her name wasn't attached big fail
I just got 0$
This is the best the producers could do with the video? Repeat the same stupid pose?
Beyonce,I'm going to keep it real from an old white guy,,I don't like it but I bet if I hear it enough I would be humming it or singing ,thanks hot chick, sure would like to meet you
I love this song!
This is trash asf you repeat the same shit over your getting to old for this dress your age be a mom tf 🤢🤮
LOVE YOU
Texas hold em!
Daisy said hi
Wow this song blows!!
Its kinda trash and pleae help me escape from this song its eveywhere!
Hey it’s Franklin
This is stupid
Where is the video of her actually dancing?
The funny thing is they just use the same scene over and over and over
This song is horrible
0:22 Car company.
Can not stand this song 🤮🤮🤮
This literally made it to Viking FM. Nice stuff!
Damn all the money this women has, yet not enough to wear a normal bra 😭😭
She is such a pretty girl I don't understand the necessity of making a video like this.
I don’t care what people say,  this is not country.
😐 eh
so ya took a look at the apple music charts, saw zach, and morgan dominating and said lets capitalize? I reckon you’re just doing your job, best of luck, but it doesn't sound country, sounds contrived. Yes I'm a hater, hater podcast coming soon
What's the hype about Aint that great
ew....
Music good but Video not so good
I remember Beyonce telling an interview that she wouldn't take off her clothes for fame. Yet, here she is. And she threw shade at another girl group for allegedly taking off their clothes for fame. What happened to morality, saying no, and allowing your song to speak for itself? If you're doing too much in a video, then you're not sure if the song will sell without you stripping down. But, let's be honest, the fans are pushing this because of what Jay-Z said at the Grammys about her not winning Album of the Year. Now, wasn't she awarded R&B album of the year? Anyhoo, It's amusing that Jay-Z remained silent when Snoop, Diana Ross, Cardi B, Rick Ross, and others NEVER got a Grammy. So, it seems as if the plan was to complain at the Grammys, have Beywance wear the cowboy hat, have someone complain that some local small radio station is refusing to play her song and make it appear the station was being prejudice then people will be upset and rally to get the song played. But ya'll got played! Anyhoo! I like country music, but this song was thrown together and has no heart. It's just plain country pop. So, I'll give it a C-.a
Put a shirt on 😭
❤😊♥️🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🐴🥰
Go Texas Bee !!!
She ate this song up😊
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
What the hell is this video supposed to be is she a futuristic time traveler who plays shitty attempts at country music
If you think this is country there is something wrong with you fr!
What an amazing👏👏👏 ምድረ አሽቃባጮች 😜እሄንን ስሙ 🤣🤣🤣
Worst country song to date, I don’t think she could use anymore country adlibs 😂
If I had a pound for every time I heard this song I would have 1’0000 pounds right now
Cultural appropriation ?
This song sucks. Annnnd this shit ain't country.
I think this person plumb forgot she has kids!!  Internet lasts forever though.
Wow, this is fucking bad.
Sooo we are just watching her walk and rub her hand up herself and imitate a gun?  For real?    I would expect more.
Why does she think she have to half naked?
Noooo, STAHP. My ears! 💀
Now the slaves something they can jam to
Here comes Franklin theam song 😂😂😂
I used to listen to this when I was 63, and now I'm 17. This will forever be a classic.
What actual human find this to be catchy or well done. It comes off as such an obvious grift.
Trashy
The Queen of Vulgar has a really cute, catchy tune here.
I love her music but this ain't no country. Voice is beautiful though 😂
Poser, skanking, and old. Move on.
Absolutely loving it.
If i had a dollar for every time I've heard this song I'd gave 0
🤠
Why is nobody noticing what she is wearing ,like just put some clothes 🤣💀💀
I don't like it!  and second, replaying a 10 sec video clip about 10 times of her half naked says a lot.  If you have to sell your sexuality, your song can't stand on it's own and can't be that great...or does she sell her body out like that for every video she does?  Not a fan!!
Beyonce, aqui também é Texas❣
Beyoncé ouawe🤩. Très sexy ❤.  Et tu as une trop belle voix ❤.     Vas jusqu'aux bouts 🙏🏽
She is just trying fit in
She is gross!!!
Omg kids are watching to omg what the hell is wrong with you ppl 🤢🤢😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
This is ass but Beyoncé still bad as hell
It’s bad karaoke at best.
Not making it in hip hop no more   when they switch to country a down fall usually follows
Dumb video
This song makes me want to drink antifreeze
Celebrities who embrace female hypersexualization.  Women having a sexual representation As if it were an object of desire increases hatred against women, rape culture and makes women see themselves As an object,nare you going to take responsibility for this? The female body is displayed thirty times more naked than the male body and women are already 60% breasts and butts and 40% women.The majority of women who self-hypersexualize are black, and because they are always sexualized they end up repeating this behavior, every time someone does blackfishing they copy the image of a Sexual, aggressive, loud woman. Do you really have no idea what you do? education is lacking in Texas. I'm just giving the context
Que issooooo Brasillllllllllllllllll😮😮😍😍😍😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Bella la canzone ma il video non dà emozioni
Love the song ..but shit vid
Not a fan of video love the song
First of all, why half naked?  It's a great song but not sung by her.  Can't she just disappear?
Beyonce could put on a shirt
Song sucks
What a disappointment of a video. I really thought you wld make a great video not a point shot of herself.
Yaaassss queen 👑✨🫶
Fucking illuminati shit
I have a dress up day tomorrow as a famous person and I’m picking you😂❤
This must be that desperate point some artists hit during their career when they've run out of hit songs so they start releasing crap.  I really would have expected better from beyonce That's all her video is is a loop of her walking up ,what she said  ,Hey yall ill just show skin in the video and keep repeating ,who cares how it looks im beyonce i can release crap and have no creativity 🙄
"Don't sexualize us!"
Why do we have to be subjected to nudity
Beyoncé la tortue 🐢
Oh so I guess black people can't culturally appropriate? Double racist standards.
Why are these satanic signs again?
what is that music video so annoying song
I dont typically listen to modern country music because it usually sucks, but Beyonce is killing it.
Hello  Beyoncé
all in all just gag song and gag vid
Heard the song rape-played on the radio. Already tired of it. Thought I'd check out the video - and boy was I so so so disappointed.
Cringe
My new work out song/ music. Single ladies got me down from size 10 to 8. Size 6 here i come.
❤this ain’t Texas!.
shes beautiful and great singer but girl  put some clothes on. Disrepecting the country music . They don't dress like that 🤮
This song is catchy and Bey kills it every time, but she missed a good dance with this one! She could have made an iconic video and dance that would’ve broke the internet
🐢🐢Sounds like Franklin the Turtle song… 🐢🐢”Hi It’s Franklin”….
Terrible
Que lindaaa
This sucks in a million different ways.
Beyoncé in her TriniBad era lol 😩
The country ppl are pissed....😂😂😂😂 no lie..... but, everything isnt for everyone... this shit made me cringe...
2099 kids just know she was among the best in our time
The Ewings and Von Erichs will be proud of her, long live Texas 🌻
Culture vultures.. straight🗑️
Cheapest clip ever
No. 1 on the Us Charts For 2 weeks And 4 weeks all now on the UK Charts at No.1 U Go B🎉🤗🇦🇬
This aint texas, this its Europe,we got it dow dow dow, you want.....
So when her daughters grow up they are going to think its ok to walk around and go to school with no tshirt on because thier mum does it? Good parenting beyonce but tbh lets face it your nanny probably does most of looking after the kids good song though and definitely one i would download..
What a shit video
Not feeling none of this at all
This is insanely good coming from not a country singer...
Le clip est vraiment trop nul 😂😂😂😂
This is absolute trash
This song is to good
She’s all legs. So sexy. I’m 37 and was made fun of my whole life for thick legs. Jeans never fit in the legs…. But GD my legs like hers are sexy.  I’ve had the best compliments of my life about my legs.  Gd b!!! I love it actually and I’m not even down with her but jeezzzzz.
Worst country ever .....when dolly shows her bits , its ok cause she is a darling
this isn't country music yall💀
Such a proud mother!
Sono letteralmente ipnotizzato
What the hell is this crap is people running out of ideas.
Man where the real video
Eine tolle Sängerin. Beyonce kann einfach alles Singen.
well i aint really a fan if hers but i like this song
Why is the video on repeat?
I love this song so much
Better take a chichi to chatter
Most definitely isn't country music
It be Nice if She had Clothes  on Versus a pair of pantyhose and a vest .No real Clothes!
I expected a visual to be nice country muaic dance from beyonce.. poor me 😅
This isn’t country music 😂 Yall city folk wouldn’t know country if it hit you in the face
She has trust in that jacket
Catchy but dumb 🤷🏻‍♀️
The song's pretty good but this middle-aged woman needs to grow up and put some god damn clothes on.
The song is overrated.
queen
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now spent 4 weeks at #1 in the UK! 👑🐝
Stay in the pop/slut genre though you're good at it.
This is not country music and 103.7 should stop fucking playing this garbage song
This is my favorite song and cuff it.
😢
Gawd dayumm she still so damn fine 🥵
Coming from a real country girl this is the worst country ever played I swear this shouldn't be a thing I love the song but Beyonce is not a country singer I'm sorry I love all her other songs but country is a story or Abt love not bars and guns some are but there's normally some reason
This is a very lazy song no country in it and it’s on repeat no creativity she can throw any new song out there knowing people will buy her stuff just because her name is on it it’s like these artists nowadays starves for attention put ads everywhere honestly is very sad it’s like look at me I’m claiming to be black and I’m from Texas so I should win an award or I’ll start problems and bitch about how my life isn’t fair she doesn’t care about anybody else she’s rich!!! She just wants the title she would stomp over anybody just to get it 🙄
She is prob trying to have a bf 💀
Beyoncé puede hacer lo que ella quiera y siempre le saldrá de lujo!!! Amo su música!!!!
I thought she was going to do the dance everybody is doing🤷‍♀️🤔
I'm confused
put some clothes on please!
This is a great sing and she slays it, as always.
Beyoncé hates white people but is now trying to be country is hilarious
Very catchy I have my coworkers singing this all the time!
Aber was ist das für ein blödes Video?
Il video più brutto
Such a good song 😄😊
Great grandma, wake up from your coma, Beyoncé is country now! 😮
This song sucks
Does she not know list is a sin? I’d be so embarrassed to show my body off to the world like this. Her husband and children should be embarrassed of her. Have some class for your body.
Is it important to show them body in them songs??
I’m not a fan of I like country music, not pop country. But good for her for trying.
Ain’t nothing about that country music!!!
Not sure about this one Queen B it's sounds like a red neck cracker tune
Song is not bad....except for her saying "Wit chew.".
Gamorah
This isn’t country. Still pop music with country sounds. Straight trash.
Worst video ever 🤢🤢
Well, Beyoncé, did it again. 😊
This is not country . I love her voice but surely not country .
Yes she deserve album of the year ❤
Bs
Boo
Get tired of all the tits.....great sone!
This is not country music. I come from the prairies grew up on the I ranch I still live on and this shit is wack.
black women want respect, yet their 'queen' always try's to show all she possibly can? What happened to talent without being naked?
Please no...
Boring 🥱
Is she singing "it's a fucking Lexus"?
you walk like an egyptian
This isnt country, its just lazy. Beyonce is cashing in on jay zs promise that she is just handed grammies. This blows
She looks exactly like Jay-Z with no makeup on
So pretty
Blud needs a shirt 💀
Just why? 🤦🏻‍♀️
EH C'EST FRANKLIN ! 🎶
Absolutely terrible, she’s about as country as Pauly Shore.
The boobs are glitching
Franklin the Turtle did it much better. 😂
This song does not go with this outfit.  Go naked next time
Bro, just a few minutes before that you decided to go all country you’re not country
I love when artists drive in other lanes once in a while
What a bloody disappointment of a video
I agree. I love it
Trash song + Starts with a Illuminati Symbols bahhh go away from my face
And I'll be damned if I can't slow dance with you......  When Beyonce says…"with you" It's like she is saying Chuuu😂  Zimbabweans where are you?😂😂😂😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤🇿🇼
❤️🥺🥺🦋🦋🐌🦋🐞🦩💥🐣
Middle aged country white people are seething so bad. 😭 Just have fun in life god damn
Hey, it's Franklin
I used to love Beyonce.  After she married Mr Carter she got very racist during the riots.  Forward to today and this song, this is the Beyonce I enjoy, making music for everyone to enjoy w politicals involved.
Cultural appropriation at its worst
Beyonce wants to changed her Fan Base! R&B To Country..No more Hood..
Song is okay, but really keep the flesh covered! Country doesn't need that!!
God d@mn she looks fine
please Bey go back to R&B
I'm not a Beyonce fan, nor do I dislike her either, but this song isn't bad at all and I really don't know why it has received a lot of the hate that it has. It has a nice catchy beat to it, and if any r&b singer could pull off a country song, it would be Beyonce
This trash isn't country music...
This isn't country but her voice is great! This sounds more like r&b with some twang 😂
I don't like beyonce much but this song is so so fun. It's sexy but in a flirty, cheeky way. She nailed it.
Unfortunately having someone write you a country song, and being famous enough to sing it and get millions of views Doesn't make you a country singer 😅 Too funny
THE LAST TIME I MOVED MY BODY NEXT TO THE DANCE FLOOR I BROKE TWO RIBS  NOT TRYING TO BE A B****😞
Beyonce, Finally came out to be the beautiful ❤️ woman 👠 she is, God bless you and your family.I love Texas👻👻👻
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been Shazamed over 1 million times! Keep Shazaming this song! It helps with radio play! 👑🐝
Just wear s bra or something girl young folks are also watching or you ain't even  bothered since you participate and experience through them...  Poor Little ANGELS. shame on you Beyonce
This is hot garbage, shows as people how backwards we are heading with shit like this hitting number 1, just because she can doesn’t mean she should trassssh
I just think the clothes too much . The sound nice and it sounds country .
Wow not country and sure as hell ain’t from Texas!!!!
doce
Needs to stick to R&B or whatever the hell she sings. Don’t need her in country music.
She is nak3d
Adele is literally on a Jumbotron, and they’re at a concert. Leave the boy alone! He’s doing nothing wrong and people do stand up at concerts. Those people could see fine. Concert tickets nowadays are not cheap, so they had some money either pay for better tickets, or stand up. I say that with a caveat that I am getting older as well. And I’m only 5 feet tall. But I would not get mad at someone standing up and getting excited at a concert. That was very childish of the people that came up to say something to him.
great song stupid video
Obsessed 🤩
I think she is warning us about a coming disaster.  There’s a heat wave coming at us.
Her bOObs almost showed 😭😭😭
It's okay
This isn’t country
❤
Video is stupid it just shows her walking up, shooting a fake gun with her fingers are blowing out to smoke
الفديو ماله علاقة بالاغنية
This song goes hard on mute
What’s with this repetitive move? It’s annoying
Best fit ever
🐢 Franklin is not impressed
waooooo me encanta este country
TRASH so washed up can’t make pop music anymore. What a “culture”vulture 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
actually a little better than some of the stuff they're trying to pass off as country these days
This is stuck in my head. Have never really enjoyed country music until now
Please never do this again, love your music but this makes me wanna cry.
Absolutely awesome song.
Every day in my gym class we listen to this song
The shirt 😱
🤮👎
I wonder why nobody talks about all her nips and tucks she don had a ton of surgery I'm sure
Yeah her music is trashy. She can keep her half naked music in the crap she used to do. She is definitely not country.
pudo haber explotado mejor esa canción, con un vídeo mejor.  Video muy malo
Fucking A 1-1-3030. It's Almost Over With. This Will Be Talk About Till The Elite's Get Very Piss And Take All There Money And Prize Back Soon. But Do U And Tired Of Hearing It Just TMZ Got Me Here 2😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂And Congregation 2 Her It's Not Hate It's Fact's.
A hoe down, jive bar.... Ya idk if i can even picture Beyonce at any of this places LMAO
Leave the country music to taylor, you could never be ms swift just saying mmmmmhmmmm 😂
This is the most stupidest song ever like what’s up with everyone bringing Texas all of a sudden into songs like shits really dumb asf Beyoncé just needs to retire from the mic cause she can’t sing at all
👍👍👍👍🌷🌻🌷🌻🌷🌻🌷
Country music really gone to HELL now. Complete takeover by the devil.
Dammit, I think I like it.
nobody is believing that she is into country now... she is only in to grab more $$$$....geez she also need her b**bs to sell it
If I had 1 dollar each time I've heard this song I had $372
She only came to this genre because all the rest are dead. Country music is alive because of its morals inside music. Her and her fake husband only care for money. They don't care about the culture or the art. Now that rap,pop and R&B is dead she will try to lead that same garbage towards country music.   If this continues country music will look just like a new apartment building that's was built in the hood. Give it a year and there will be colt 45 bottles and blunt guts on the red carpet at the CMA's.   Go save rap from being garbage instead of coming here with this trash.   Everyone acting like this song is good because it's a black woman.   Nobody that is really country thanks so. Nobody will go to a country event to see her. That I promise.
gostei
This is not contry music
Please stop. Please stay in your lane. Keep your pop music crap there. Stop attempting to appropriate country music to a culture it doesn't belong. There is nothing country about this garbage.
Nul
Beyonce Satan
Good song but Boy Once doesn't represent what it's singing about.
What is this….. a thirst trap where is the music video
Who came here bc of The meme 😂
I hate your music
You satan beyonce
I will beat you Beyonce say 10 I will beat you  demon
I ❤ this.
❤ hypnotic,  love her love the song
Sick of seeing people appropriate my culture haven’t you taken enough from us
This song is living rent free in my head ❤🇿🇦
This is some weird as shit
Nice song 5/10
It's not country it's pop
Deliverance a banjo  something not heard much in mainstream music these days yeh ha great song
It's a real live boogy and a real live hoe down...       huh
Country music at its finest folks.  All you need is an acoustic guitar... a synth drum.... and crowd chants.  I need to wake up from this retard version of the world
Minek van rajta az a felső?Miért kell vetkőznie???Ez is megbolondult komolyan!!!Marha fantázia dús egy videó👎
People can say what they like but this song is so Catchy I love it I have it stuck in my head all day 😂
Sexy 🔥
Stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.
She is no longer famous , her views of MV getting less every year.
£347
😮😮😮😮😮
She’s a terrible singer!
this does NOT feel like a video that was 1 month ago.
Finde das Video doof
Bro its not good ewww
If you want do  a gospel track let me know
Surely you have a big enough budget to do more than repeat the same scene over and over again.
Hate ittttttt!!!!
She doesn't have to resort yo wearing such skimpy outfit. She is larger than life already.
I hope this isn't the official video. It sucked.  But she's so hot I guess it doesn't matter. Lol.
Jesus Christ this might be the worst song I've ever heard. And will somebody please get this woman a shirt
It's a good song, but why does a body have to be nekkid 😅
I love you yenoce..❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
How about you STOP acting country you are a joke
❤❤❤❤❤
Nope
No😢
Shitty song
She’s not country and her sing sux
That shit ain’t pretty said it all 🥴  Beyonceeeee why??? Stay in ur lane plzzz… love ur music but this just isn’t cute sorry 🤷‍♀️
I wish that first beat was throughout the entire song though
I just don’t understand the concept of having to be half naked, to promote a song.
No one:  Absolutely no one:  What I hear: Well I ain't never....been the Barbie doll type.
Que vídeo tan triste y decepcionado Creo   Nada que ver con lo que está en tiktok
Trash
This song is rotting me.why is it everywhere?..
I absolutely do NIt get that it’s on a loop and just this short (what is it anyway) clip
Je crois que elle a oublié son t-shirt
I like it a lot, but as a Trekkie, I just see Borg 😂
cover your breasts, young woman.  let your voice be your talent.........
Estou amando a Bey Country 😍😍 Cadê os BR 🇧🇷
Like it or not, it is interesting and different and have to respect the talent.
Love the song but the video is dumb!
How to tell this "crossover" song is BOMBING and her "country" album is sure to follow?  There are at least half a dozen "official" videos.
Why ya naked?   Good music doesn't need antics
Bro thinks she country and thinks we’re scared of tornados
She’S LITERRALY NAKED just THE JACKET COVERS HER U KNOW🍑
What a HORRIBLE VIDEO 😢
La canción esta pegajosa pero el video está para la chingada aburre y dice uno que pendejada video
Beyonce is gonna make everyone a country girl/boy 😂
Minha divã eu amo essa mulher ❤❤❤❤❤
This isn't country. This is pop. Does she REALLY think throwing a hat on her head would make her country? Well, if I throw Texas and Hoe down in there I can  be country and if they do not like it I'll scream rAcIsM... and she thinks shes done something neat here  😂😂😂🤮 The whole thing is trashy 😂
WTF?  This sounds like some WTF BS............It has a gospel sounds trying to be country.........FAKE as F***
Where's the video
Hey its Franklin
....that beat ....so familiar....FRANKLIN??? https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
Has anyone noticed that the vid is a repeating feed?  Just saying.
Well i fell a sleep🥱👋bye
Bro, you aren’t even saying anything country you’re just talking about Texas
This 304 is not a country artist. Take that garbage elsewhere. With that opening you just seem like a low rent only fans model. 😂
Oie , digo para ninguém desistir dos seus sonhos 💚  A música é Texas Hold da Bionce 💚
A bad artist gets worse 🤠please stop using air if this is how you use it
I hate this song, not because its bad, its cuz i keep hearing it so many times
Al invadir as tierras que eran de México nace estos personajes del oeste. A México le deben esa historia del oeste. Al ir a poblar los territorios robados. 😢
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Her pantyhose are on backwards.
Period 🥰🥰🥰🥰
😍
Slayyyyyyyy❤❤❤❤❤❤
J'adore la chanson mais le clip nul à chier
Nahh... not good.
After all the back lash  She is killing it lol Amazing song 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She is awesome hate the repetitive video. !
Didn’t know Beyoncé sang country
Franklin the Turtle theme song bought me here.
I thought she'd dance🤷🤷
FAKE COUNTRY. YOU SUCK!!!
My client said sound like she typed on a description to an ai app I’m like pleeeeeeaseeee
Beautiful Rihannon Giddins. What a treat for music lovers!
I normally don't do "youtube to mp3" of pop stars. But can't help it, it's really good! 🎉  Bravo Beyonce!
People tend to forget Bey was born in Houston Texas! She’s always been a little country in the way she talks but she was raised in the church which is how most of the great R&B singers started out! Bey will always be a soulful singer and I kinda like this song it’s different! I just wish people would stop comparing her to these old red necked white dudes that sing these hillbilly tunes! Nobody wanna sound like them anyways!
Like I said, hope she does more country music. Not crazy about the lyrics, and would have much better seen her wearing jeans at bar on riding horse. I don't get the half naked clothes. Why do have be half naked?? I guess it's her thing to show all.
God I hope she does more country songs!!
She looks fantastic! I was expecting to see a video with more substance, though lol great boobs!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Kind of damn good country song !!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
This is just an insult to country music and it's crappy throw back to 2000s with a guitar twang sounds cheap boring and is pure desperation!
wtf 🤦🏻‍♀️
i don't even mind hearing this song all over my algorithm tbh, it's fantastic
Whye do people write an entire thesis in a comment section?
Maranach fi texas hna
What a suprising video. 😅😅😅
If i had dollar for every time I've heard this song TODAY, I'd have $35
Beyonce hermosa ❤❤
Beyonce hermosa ❤❤
Hermosa la canción ❤❤❤
Love u
That’s a seriously corny song but it’s better than most modern country music. At least she has a great voice.
It’s a harsh play on what country music is.  Country music is strongly solidified in heritage, history, tradition, conserving what’s right and good, faith in god and a specific lifestyle.  Beyoncé seems to do good with emulating this but she’s a far cry from country and the veil is thinner than the translucent top she’s not wearing.  It’s definitely not country music but it is a good pretend rendition of what a non country  musician could imagine it is.
I just want all of you to know that Jesus loves you so much that He died for your sins on the cross so that you may be forgiven
why are you  amost showing your melons
I hate Beyonce no one likes her
Beyoncé your not a country singer
I used to think she was so dumb. I stand corrected. Thank you, B for liberating the people from fast food "music" and bringing them one of the best black banjo players and singer, Ms. Giddens.  https://youtu.be/MV6Xs-0jmeQ?si=6baaCAzeXUAE3LVK
Shits ass tbh
I like the song. But as for her she's like  Willie nelson. I luv his songs too as long as I don't have to look at him
This is a pop song with a country sample??? 😂😂😂😂. This shit sucks
This shit trash 🚮 🗑️
This is a cute litle diddy, and it's highly catchy. I can't stop singing parrs of it randomly, for zero reason, lol. I do wonder something, though: why bey always gotta have her t#tties, booty, crotch skin in vid? This was a vid of her boobies bouncing on loop. :/   i don't get it. She's gorgeous w or wout makeup, and i think that she's most beautiful w natural hair and street clothes on.
Keep it up girl I’m loving the new song❤❤❤
Love love this song way to go bounce
All the fine things kept from your eyes and ears  https://youtu.be/a4Xlyi8Is98?si=NSyYdYnwR-4OrsrX
Is tht all the video???
I heard it’s illegal to play this song in Texas
Wow some video !!! For sure gonna win best music video award.... So original  (Sarcasm at its finest)
Why not just remove everything 😂
💪super song
.
Música ruim mas como se trata da byonce faz sucesso
RIHANNON! The magic source.
Come on now, she could have put some clothes on, always showing something .... omgoodness
this is absolutely ass
Beyoncé you were my fav from when I was growing up n now it’s over a decade later💚🌿 you are a timeless beauty💗and can pretty much pull of any genre you want
That woman still fine
Beyonce's FIRST below the hip bass line and it took country folk to provide it. Talk about cultural irony!
1 not country music 2 stolen from Kenny Rogers 3 why are your tits out
Not country? Who in the world doesn't get music genres? If it's not country, what name are we giving it.....with a straight face, while the lyrics spell it out with every phrase?
NOT A FAN OF HER COUNTRY SONG.
Women be dressing like this and have the Audacity to blame men for looking.  Never seen any men roaming around wearing the dress they used to wear when they're 3 years old
Good lordt this woman is... 🔥🔥🔥
She’s like Ai. She controls the algorithm! Literally
from a slipknot fan............ this is 🤟 rockin.......fab ❤
This is not country for fuck sake.
. I play this on dirt roads before I take my daughter to ride ponies.  Sorry bout ya if you don't like this.
You kept spelling me all my life with how many witches that you don't understand it's stupid fucking music .. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
With the incredible Rhiannon Giddens on banjo. This is the real shit.
Storyteller for life, true artist here, you go!!
We want more bey!! Life in my veins!
Be a lady and put on bra and blouse! Selling your soul to the devil for wealth! Set better examples for your 2 daughters!
Musique pas mal mais clip a chier elle est fauchee?...
I Dare CMT or Grammy’s, BET any one of these Award shows to DENY Beyoncé Album of the year. She has killed it in every genre of music! There no excuse’s. But one rigged!
This isnt country.
"Park your lexus" like girl this is so cringe it's no country music💀
Nanalan
Yee Freakin Haw  to one smooth Routin  Toutin saddle Hustling Rodeo of a Woman...God Bless Dear Friend  from DeTriniVyBez YuhDonKnow!!!

I hateeeeee youtubeeeeee adddddddddssss
Definitely not country lol😂
what the hell is this sex sells not the music
Eso es todo? El baile lo inventó la gente?
Ain't country.
My feed is killing me with this song
Love IT❤
Not my fav song by you girl not to be rude but it sounds like youre making fun of country
What an evil batch. So many illuminati symbols 😂
This song is so stupid and dumb
Takie mamy głupie i puste czasy ...  Jak nie ma czym się wybić to trzeba pokazać cyca albo dupę. ..  Słabe czasy, słabi i puści ludzie
This is so weak
Love the song but I think the video is a little inappropriate for kids
Low budget on this video. Bored.
So good
Actually so happy
So happy ur doing country now
Not interested  in that repetitive video. Song is good though.
Ready for the album
Definitely NOT a country song more pop if anything.
Satanism
OMG
Women 😂hatin on beyonce be like luke bryan combs
She got a new producer. One who knew what he was doing. The reason her awful music sold at all is because the past 2 generations had no art budgets in high school. When your diet is junk, your taste buds never develop. Add a lot marketing and fraudulent top 40 lists, and you get market success no matter how lousy the product.
Wtf
Terrible!!!
Jay z is a lucky bastard.
I like it but this isn’t country and we don’t need the nudity
My dream woman since 1998 ❤
Desculpa mas o sertanejo estadunidense não me desce, igual o nacional, mas o like da gata está dado, arrazou!
SUCH A BORING VIDEO! Good song though, I prefer other people’s dance videos of this song tbh.
I pray anybody reading this have a good day and I hope everything is going good in your life right now or soon just pray and believe    Subscribe if you see me for a comment 🇯🇲🍪❤️
Great song, well done, but the video - not so much.
Wow that’s stupid!
Yo esperando ver a los maríachis bailar
She may be from Texas, but she is no country artist. She seems to think the dark forces are more powerful than The light of Jesus Christ.
Wtf is she wearing.. 🤢😱🙈
Good dong crap video
Love how this song has so many low range notes.  Sounds good
Aint no way beyonce made a country song
El video más barato no pudo ser 😅😅😅
😂😅🤣❤
💩
People really falling for this money grab too huh
This shi give me chills🔥🔥🔥🔥this song a summer vibe❤️🌴
If you send ticket can you can you take it fun for my sister and one for me
I have a dance to your song Bianca
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢
I love your song Bianca
Elo matesss
Love the song, FYI old white guy
Me: I don't like country!  Beyoncé make a music country:  Me: 🐎🤠👢🙌
Yup
Call'em out baby 💥🤠💥💥😎💥
Wow love the song but the video is 😮
I fucking hate this song 🙏
I love Beyoncé, I love country music and the first 20 seconds of this song had me excited, but… this is just plain awful. It’s so… trying too hard. Sorry B, it’s a bust for me.
I'm thinking this could quite be video of the century
Ayo
Trash
illuminati much
😢 as a white guy I dont feel comfortable with this...
This is proof that reality isn’t real. Music is a façade for coorporate seretonin. American ingenuity died when Batman protected the corporation.
🥵🥵🥵🤪
Awful
She is culturally vulture
I saw chinchillas play this song.
Nice song.. horrible video
pistolera💗🤘🏾👉🏾...beautiful song
$1M artificial breast
I'm a Ghanaian but my love for country music 🎶  is exceptional.  And I love this one too
the brotherhood of the snake is dead, fuck off
What’s more pathetic, her in this silly video or people that watched the whole thing. This is the worst song I’ve ever heard and what’s with the gun insinuation, I thought the left hated guns. She is taking the mick out of all of us and we know the reason why.
You are the best queen B.
Such a great song. Beyonce's talent is overwhelming, in the best possible way. She rules.
This is the theme song to "Hey it's Franklin" look it up and thank me later. You won't be able to un hear it ROTFLMFAO 🤣😭🤣😭...
I'm 100% convinced she put this track out to show jason darulo how country is supposed to sound after "Hands on Me" lol
This is rich ❤
Trash & trashy and dolly pardon said "it's a fine start " this is a finish dolly from country dolly...when this Ho gets done with it. for me the great days are dead.
I feel sorry for her. Something's not right. 😮
I love
WTH did her get up have to do with this song.  Just icky.
Not too shabby, sistagurl...
Why is she naked??
I'm sorry but this her worst song she's not for country
Elle perd sa classe, vêtue comme ça !
Why is she half naked. She is so talented she doesnt need to shoq her boobs like thay
Ive been a country music fan since the 80s since I can remember this isn't country its r&b trying to mimic country.  Darius Rucker definitely, jewel 100 percent,   gwen  stefani  yes !! This no definitely  not not even close  !!
Dullsville ….🤷🏼‍♂️😳
Fuckin garbage!! How about you post a video of you putting tape over your mouth. I’d watch that
I like her voice but this one it doesn’t sound country
Song down to #5 now. Listen to those lyrics.
It's a hybrid of R&B, soul  and country. Artists are creative and this is her art. You may not like it but have you ever liked EVERYTHING from anybody? You can respect the creator without trashing the creation.
Totally immodest...
Beyonce trying to get uncancelled with some country half naked ? Her handler is really pushing it these days
3:57 3:57 3:57 3:57 3:57
Sweet Bee-Haww shook my mouth and slap your grandma. 😂  Who is pickin' on them strings?
Horrible
What a great impersonation of Dolly Parton. Well done tribute to the Queen of Country Songs.
The song is good. The video is disappointing.
The song is fine, but I cane here to listen to Rhiannon Giddens play on the Jim Hartel minstrel banjo.
No se ustedes pero me gusta más esta versión   https://youtu.be/3SeT13bZjYU?si=KNB-rTKdcfjV3wMz
What a lame ass video. Nice try honey.
TRASH
She has more trust in that jacket then i do in Jack Black
All she needs is Ryan Bingham
Really, she's not country should be X rated! I'm from Texas and find that offensive
That's it SMH! She not doing nothing.
Can’t stop playing this song. It’s one of Beyoncé s best songs. Country has no colour.
Congrats on the worst country song since the Advent of country music. You suck out loud. Worse than Toby Keith.
So over this song… She is making fun of us that live the country life. Girl, come ride my horse and gather cattle. Let’s see how you do in your bougie half-dressed outfit and heels.
I love this song so much
She looks like a mortal Kombat character
Beyonce, Once Upon a Time, we shared a stage together., - STAR SEARCH. Yours was the group just before us.  You performed ...,&  lost. You girls were so young. Your precious voices, your faces,... just not your time.  So many tears for a young man trying to gather his spirit to go on next.  Me.  I spoke briefly with your Mom while you cried on her belly.  I suppose she felt compelled to offer me some encouragement as I believe she saw that I was so scared and was carrying a heartbreak of my own. We went on, (PRIVATE SUBJECT) and we won... I came backstage and your Mom & Father's glance at me was so full of love and congratulations it haunts me to this day. I put my hand lightly on your Moms arm and said "Thank you" but I couldn't say what was on my heart.  My Father was in the audience for the last time.  He died 12 days later.  I've forever thought back on what a privilege it is to have been blessed with loving parents. How does anyone make it any other way?  I knew you were special...our parents knew we were special before we did. Bless you and yours, always. Kirk
I love your music Beyoncé ❤
Trash 🗑️
Beyonce make a song with chapel hart❤️
This is a garbage song should stay out of country music.
Sorry Jay. Much respect but that woman is a smoke show. 👊🏻
I like how she made herself whiter with blonde hair but is the type of person to be the first to bitch about black face and cultural appropriation
Culture appropriation
Trash
La escucho todas las mañanas q ya me gustó
BEYONCE IS MOST DEFINITELY A GENIUS ABSOLUTELY 💯 PERCENT CORRECT WELL DONE TO THE HIGHEST,🙏🙏🙏 WHAT A HIT,💯 PERCENT 🤩🤩🤩 DO IT MRS.CARTER AND I LOVE YOU AND YOUR MUSIC ALWAYS 😘😘😘
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS IS NORMAL R&B / HIP HOP WITH A WOMAN LIKE BEYONCE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THIS IS COUNTRY. SAD
Reminds me of this song  https://youtu.be/U9t-slLl30E?si=_RezvG2rkPorW0Ac
The song is a banger, but the video is 🤮 and does not match the vibe of the song. You're trying too hard to be "hip", you should've done a wholesome music video with a Texan vibe and an actual hoedown.
Tension to give Beyoncé some clothes 🔥🔥🔥🙊
I really had to come and listen to this song because if I followed what other people were talking about Beyonce country song I would think it ain't good but it's very good.....she definitely can do country!!! I love her voice in this song and I give her 10+ and I'm not really a Beyonce fan....❤
OMG do plp just like anything now days?? This song is freaking terrible! Beyonce if ur reading this stop. Ok stop . This is not country music smfh
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️  it's not like any of us have anything to worry about. This will never make it on the country music radios ever b**** b**** b**** ho ho ho b**** b**** wow 😂😂😂😂😂
What the hell is this shit because this is more like a rap and a strip show but y'all want to consider this Beyonce's country music  😂😂 she should really stay at what she's doing good at and countries not it
WOW that must have taken every brain cell she had to create that video
Go BBBB! My song of the spring and summer!!!
This song sucks ,nice jugs.
The new Josie Wells
I love you Beyoncé I was at your concert I really want to met
Shit was ass🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is it?!?!  Thought if check out THE official video from Beyonce after watching so many dances from everyone on this song?   Pretty shit, yep she got boobs,. ..and?   Some of the dances on shorts feed from general public got more views than this vid..  😂😂 Power To The People 🎉❤
This is so  beautiful  music❤
The song is fine. It is just the way they layered it. With Country music everything works together like a duet all throughout the song. Most Country songs are telling a story so that is why everything flows together throughout, to keep you interested all throughout the song. It flows together but it is missing the unity of everything together consistently. Like, when it is the banjo her as a the backup singers and her as the lead. It is the banjo last, the backup singers and then her first. It is more of RnB with the fun of Country, so I guess it is RnB Country if it needs a genre. With RnB the lyrics and vocals do most of the work, or it changes through out like . . . 😁If you are from the country (south for me) then you know, we have a lot of time on our hands☺️😁❣️
Where the short of him hitting his shots tho, I think that’d get more views
Only country song I’ll listed to
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good song but massive disappointment on the clothing. It's far below what someone like Beyonce should wear.... And it's a terrible message
I was in drama class earlier, and my teacher put this on! Best few minutes of my life! x
STOP YOU ARE NOT COUNTRY    AND YOUR COUNTRY MUSIC SUCKS
Nah
I miss the "good ol' days" when women didn't have to be half naked to prove their worth. xo
I like the song but it’s a plain video
JENNY MARRY ME ❤😅👰💍🤵‍♂💒🫶🧿✨️
Good Lord 👀
Please jump
This is just sad. This song is a piece of 💩. Go do something else
Trash, what the fuck was Beyonce thinking, this sucks it really does
Love it. She kills every damn thing she does. ❤❤
❤❤❤
This is not country
Beyonce is irrelevant and is jelly of swifty. 😂😂😂 honey this not your lane. Gwen can pull it off not you.
Love the song but the music video is on repeat 😭
Hell yeah love it 💜 Beyonc'e  .
Uhm kids friendly pls 😊 there are little kids on the internet…
Black Americans created the country genre too! What did the oale people do again other than slave and pillage?
Oh my ☺️ entities are entities too 😁😂🤣🧑‍🎤❣️
Trash... I'm not a country fan but I know enough to say that she flopped this song.
This is one shite 'song' ... and it's pronounced, 'with you' not witchoo.
Ehh those panties look like she's packing something in there 😶

Not mine.. and girl. PUT A DAMN SHIRT ON OMFG
No big deal! Good song no doubt but the video is 👎🏻 plus Beyonce of all people shouldn’t have to bare her body to attract attention!

Sounds like Franklin the kids show.
This is a terrible song and its not even country so Beyonce youd really best stick to your pop music.
This shit ain't country, it's pop with a banjo.
NOT A BEYONCE OR COUNTRY MUSIC FAN, BUT LIKE THIS SONG.  LIKE THE INSTAGRAM VIDEOS BETTER.
listening to this song in Texas rn
O.m.g. She has no style in country music, or appearances. Stay I your Own lane lady.🤦🏻‍♀️💀
Franklin theme song hit the like
It’s a no for me
So sex sells.. 🤣 Because this is definitely NOT country! Regardless of the rhythm!! Funny how true country fans accept this sad shit!!
WTF
He's definitely up to 100 problems...
Beyonce stay in your own lane, you're not Taylor Swift and you are definitely not country, those lyrics make no sense whatsoever, beat it!
Sounds like ai produced this song. Also her voice is sounding pieced together like edited
Se esforzaron mucho haciendo el vídeo 😂😂😂
Eh I like it 💁🏿‍♂️
It would be nice if she would wear some clothes
CN we get a behind-the-scenes
Excellent.  I love love it soooo much 🎉🎉🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍🌹🎉
She's born and raised in Texas..Negative comments doesn't stop anything she chooses to do. I love that she making country music. I love this song.
Who's here from TikTok before this was removed from sounds
Inappropriate no a offense. But the last is my favorite
Omgiii❤
Still more country than Florida Georgia Line.... 😂
I thought this song was dumb. I hear it all over tiktok so I decided to check out the music video and well, it's even worse. 😂
Dreadful song. I'm not a Beyonce hater, but this is dull.
This is terrible
Krass ich wusste bis jetzt nich das Beyonce aus Texas ist.
This is fucking horrendous
I would play this at bonfires
Cool , mais on a connu mieux comme clip.  Toujours aussi belle et belle chanson.
LMAO just like MGK
Imagine the country lovers having a stripper making music for them LMAO
Now I see why people talking g crap bout her 😂😂😂 she does not belong in country music at all !!! is she really doing that bad with her music to where she had a change genres😂😂😂😂
Country?  My ass!! Shameful!!
Kanye dressing her now?
Hi Beyoncé!!! Ma'am you really did it again what a magnificent flow and on point😅
This is not country she forgot to get dressed

This song kinda sucks if it were anyone else singing it.
ridiculous
Ma'am please stop trying to fk up country music. This is trash. You really reached with this one. 👎👎👎👎👎👎
🔥🔥
This is terrible...
Don’t worry folks. She’s not  changing sex, just her attitude.
Bahahhaa
C'est quoi ce clip en boucle 😂, on nous prend de plus en plus pour des con
Her most annoying song ever
I bet this video has more dislikes than likes…
BEE..if you want to do country great...but dress like a lady and leave the skank gear in the hip hop world.
20 seconds in and instantly regretted even giving this video a view, then I had to come back and add another view because I forgot to hit the thumbs down 🙄😅
The lyrics and all... its like someone put every stereotype they heard about country into a song. 😂
😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂Lmao!
Trash
Demon Jezebel I rebuke you in JESUS NAME!!
I like this song but why do you have to be naked?
Is this cultural appropriation?
Better than Single Lady’s.
Come on now she made this song as a statement nothing more.
This reminds me of that musical number in “Oliver and Company”, “Streets of Gold”.
Id be here earlier if i knew about music video 😂
Brilliant love it❤❤❤❤love from Ireland 🇮🇪  🇮🇪 🇮🇪
Garbage 🤢🤮
Love it!
I love this song
Obviously mouse in my freaking sink unreal b
We already have the worst song of this year
This song sounds very annoying. It doesn't sound country except for her accent others way extremely annoying with the high pitch and her video sucks it's just her being naked again and it looks fake and stupid. Why do people like this woman at all I don't understand. She's making country music fake now. She needs to retire
Intelligent video made
Je m’attendais à voir la danse de TikTok
why making yourself so low??
This song is written by a child I swear. 😂😂😂
This song sucks so much, I am sick of hearing ts everywhere I go
I came here to blame this $h*t. This f*ck*ng music is EVERYWHERE!🤯
The song is great but this video I s crap!!!
THIS ISNT COUNTRY MUSIC
So beautiful Beyonce love you to bits❤❤
“Official Video” why on earth waste time and resources for a constant loop of visual?
Repeat telecast 😅😅😅😅😅 nude pics 😊
stay to your kinda music
…it was at this moment that hank, johnny, and merle shed a tear in mourning of all they built coming down in mockery…
Mam this is not a beach pls put a shirt on😂😂😂
Dumbest video she has ever made!  Good music tho…
This song is enjoyable, whether truly coubtry or not ❤😂 strip your mind off the country barrier and you'll enjoy the song
Just to clarify, this is 100% not country. Please stop it is country ya’ll are making me sad
Worst song ever 🤢🤮🤮
Lol this ain't country...
I'm my dead mom I'm gonna lose it
I would have loved to see this awesome song with a good country clip not this half naked clip. I love the song
I love the song but video clip is shite
What a stupid artist and song
So now that country music is more popular that mainstream pop and RnB ol’ Beyoncé decides she’s a country singer now?!? How about all you fan girls & boys wake up and see this for what it really is - a money making exercise designed for the idiotic masses to lap up! Any real country fan will see right through this formulaic garbage!
What kills me with people is when they always come to say oh they're tired of the norm from these artists and when they step outside of that Norm and try a new project its THEN  oh its giving not what the project is and that's crazy to me and I love this for the artist who are stepping out into other genres and doing their thing I definitely hear country listening to the song and why? because I listen to Beyonce and I know what she's capable of and this is very different that's how it sounds different from what she's usually giving so it definitely sounds country to me. ❤
STAY IN YOUR OWN LANE!!!
This is a terrible masterpiece.
That is not country attire. Song's ok but put on some clothes.
So we just gonna ignore the fact that she doesn’t have a Belly button?
This is terrible!😮
Versión español
Tornados are real
I don't get the song because she says this aint texas but is a texas song ? It is  catchy
Holy shit, this babe deserves this, black or white ❤
What is happening?? Please make it stop and go away
Beautiful Beyoce, all you needed to pull this off was a sexy pair of high Montana boots, spurs included.
YeeehAWW Bey 💅🏽
Yea this shits garbage country wouldn’t use those lyrics just cringy, reminds me of a mall ninja who went to our gun range odd little fellow
Okay so her boobs r fake and she really wants to be naked and the eye thing is stupid looking
Nice and whack 😢
If nylon hair is the new thing, just let me know
😂😂😂 TRASH... How is the title of the song Texas Hold'em yet The first thing she says is this aint Texas Aint no holdem. & What's up with the video? Do you not know how to get down, Turn around boot scoot and buggy. 😂😂 Get back in your lexus and get outta here
Absolutely in no way is she country!!!!
I never want to hear this again bro
Show the thumbs up but not the thumbs down. Cult following is all she has going for her on this song
You can't even report this pornography . They took away the report feature .   This is a terrible song .
Back from the picture part but still  I'm 8 and this innopoet
The beginning sounds exactly like Hey it’s Franklin
SONG GOES HARD ON MUTE 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/QMLnqW9BVZk?si=4W4cIpoHLSkMBW6z
Dang she's racist.
Dang I had to look this up. It doesn't really sound country aside from the twang. I don't like it at all.
Why is it a short clip on repeat?
She tryna show them boobs off
Hey It's Franklin
Doing the one eye.
so this is it --- this is supposed to be y'alls generational Whitney Houston --- well, Houston, Texas and the 🌎 . . . "WE GOT A PROBLEM!" #iamnotofthiskingdom #thankgod
🎉😊🎉 me encanta ❤
I love in texas
🇧🇷 🇺🇲vi essa música no tiktok e vim ver quem cantava essa música fiquei surpreso nunca ia imaginar a Beyoncé cantando caltre fico muito legal eu amei...!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🇺🇲🇧🇷
La canción es muy buena…. El video nada que ver… no ofrece nada!!!
Well the way country music has gone now I’m not a bit surprised. 🙄💩
Apparently Beyonce said Black is King and she is taking country music back and returning it to the black folk-she claims black folk invented CM and white folk have appropriated it...and have appropriated it for to long now(apparently white folk have never done anything first or on their own)...why can't we just be Americans and not have to always just see just your color Beyonce? seems like everyone is handing CM over to her on a silver platter....this isn't even a good song, its just some heavily marketed,repetitive tv commercial jingle, bee boping, hip hoping song now everyone is now line dancing to.  You all just line dance her all the way to the top along with her practically naked body TH music video,Yep- she is bringing hip hop and all its glory & sexuality to CM, we will see y'all with your silver hearts covering your lady bits with your naked butts out and twerking on the dance floors soon!  BEYONCE BRINGING STRIPPING, TWERKINg to YOUR DANCE FLOORS....its too bad this is not even a good song...WAKE UP!!!
Worse video ever! 🙄
You did it Queen Bey! I love it
I love her jacket and hope it becomes the norm on the street in the US and Western Europe.
Too much tit...sorry 🤷🏼‍♀️
No, just no
My ex boyfriend says B NEVER HAS  CLOTHES ON😅 I SAID YEAH AND SHE THE ONLY 1 THAT CAN GET AWAY WITH IT❤
Can hardly listen to top 40 radio with my kid in the car due to explicit lyrics (e.g., Beyonce talking about how she wants to sit on top of you and she'll clean it up). Definitely can't watch music videos with my kid these days either. It used to be that men exploited women in music videos by having half naked gyrating women in the background, but now the women are just exploiting themselves and calling it female empowerment because they are in control of their exploitation.
When she said ”this aint texas, aint no hold em”  I felt that.
Check me out I make bangers
I’m not being rude….this ain’t country, this is pop. Beyoncé is a POP singer, not country.
This is NOT country music. This song is terrible 🤣🤣🤣
It's funny how life goes. Darned if you do the right thing and stay to the left like people expect you to but as soon you go left, the right people have something to say. With that being said, everyone is entitled to their opinions but do all y'all honestly think she cares anything about what side of the fence you all decide to be on today or tomorrow? Music is art which is meant to be enjoyed. If you don't like it, then don't listen. Simple. Regardless of who you think is a "devout" country singer and who is not, music is for everyone. It doesn't have a color and it never says who can sing it and who can't. Just enjoy life, have fun, and keep it moving. Y'all with the negatives spend way too much time on being negative. Or you're bored with your on life. Idk but find the joy-it'll do you some good. Now- carry on.
This sux!
Where is her shirt?👕
that jacket is everything to her career
Needs a shirt
Clipe barato
This is no country song and im a big fan of country
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" is now eligible for platinum in the US! 💿👑🐝
She’s ready to dip out after JAY-Z’s Epstein ways are exposed in the next month 😏 YOU AINT FOOLIN NOBODY- PLUS YOU KNEW ABOUT IT 🤯
Sorry, this sucks!
I love this song but only a hardcore women would figure.
Today torture of kenia os
I was expecting a happier and fun filled video.
Why does it hafta be about showing nakedness. Does nothing for the tune. Always the same these days. Put some clothes on!!! Otherwise I liked the tune.
B you need to sit your old a!* dwn I'm tired of looking at u and jz😅...&no I'm not jealous ...y'll
Kelly Rowland "Hey" at 2:53. No doubt in my mind.
That's it????
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t unsee this
vidéo affreusee alors que la musique est  gaie et entraînante, quel paradoxe....
Why's she got her baps out?  Lazy choreography and insulting to fans.
Since when does she do country😩 !!
💩💩💩🤦‍♂️🤣
What is the main thought of this song ? I done get it at all  I cant tell what it is about even if I try …
My new favorite song from cruel summer
Song is basically ok. Nothing special. Outfit is outrageous and uncalled for imo. There's a line between sexy and slutty and I personally think it's over the line. SMH
muzyka super  doradca od teledysku do zwolnienia
❤ this 🎵😄👏👏
Love this song so good ❤
Le clip est nul de ouf😂
Nah. Don't like the song; cannot hold a candle to REAL country singers. Plus, does she have to be practically naked?
If mama B says we're listening to country music, country music it'll be 😍😍😍😭
❤❤❤❤ sing it lady love it❤
Why always naked?
This is not country music
Sound is good but the video, I am sorry but it feels wrong because I love country artist and their appeal, style and class what message is the video trying to convey? It sits wrong on me. Now I get it my girl can do this and I look forward to her toning a few things down to give a message outside of she is competing with Taylor. Sexy and classy is not coerced with tits, butts let’s leave some of our heritage in the cultures we were born in . The belated Whitney Houston thank u for supporting the country sound in a way everyone can say ok.
This was the most stupid video I have ever seen.  This ruined it for me
Is this supposed to be country music? Hank Williams Sr and Merle Haggard are rolling over in their graves, this is pathetic.
pero si no hace nada en el video =( me gusta la canción pero nada que ver el video aburrido mejor lo veo en tik tok
This isn't country. Sorry
What a dumb*ss this music is the music from Franklin the kids cartoon 😂
I thought cultural appropriation was bad.
Love this song
Just jumping on the country music popularity bandwagon.crap! And about as far from country as you can get!
How is this allowed
the haters can't take it
Sounds like a white church type
noot country kaylee bell country but beyonce is not!!
let us support her to get her back to number one!!!!
AMAZING SONG!!!!
Catchy song but crap vid...All the money shes got and this is the best she can do....Dont bother.
I came here to hopefully see a video with a dance routine. I'm very disappointed in the video  love the song though.
Embarrassing asf that this is “country”
I’m not a Beyonce fan but her body is right !
Look I gave you likes for your destiny child stuff but country music darling you need to colab with lil Nas or billy Ray cause this ain't it honey
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been Shazamed over 900k times! Keep Shazaming this song! It helps with radio play! 👑🐝
This video is so dumb
Straight garbage.  Lyrics are garbage song is stolen from Franklin.  But I’m not surprised
This sucks ass
I'm colored.  Sorry but that's one of the laziest videos and she should stick to what she started with.   That's kinda dumb to. Country but silenced shots. No rifle, no images from what country is. Just sex and a lack of any real country in her upbringing at all.
The best part in this video when she shoot with her hands...
Top👌
Je  kif  ❤
This ain’t Franklin
I don’t know what you call this, but it damn sure ain’t country. Get outta here with this shit.
She didn’t mention mama or trains, so that ain’t Country.
I thought she was saying "so f#ck Alexas" 😂😂😂 Jzzz I've been singing it like that since forever 😭😭😭
The fact this is No. 3 music video at the moment 😂
This shit ass
Made it 1 min in and yup this song sucks
Why am I watching a repeat!!!!! Over and over
The song is fine. WTF is up with the half naked outfit? She looks ridiculous.
This is America .
She needs to rename it “CowGirl Carter”
Finalley,  She found her Self 👏👌🙏
Video I’ve ever seen in my whole entire life
This is AI. No one is this beautiful AND talented
She does not have a shirt {sounds like her}
Beste ❤
(My opinion) This is the worst song I've ever heard in my life of living.
BORING AS USUAL
Nudity is so boooooooooring and low
Sooooo the video is just if her basically naked.. doing the hoe down 😂.. music videos just ain’t the thing no more 🤦🏻‍♀️
Wpuld love to see her do a fun music video instead of these thrist traps. 😂
My cover: https://youtu.be/nY05Wt1TN0s?si=JHewEv1p7g2H6L-s
Is she really trying to break into country? This song is proof that she’s not invincible and this video is pathetic.
Congratulations. Country music song number one!
THIS SONG SUCKS
This is Texas -a Texan
If you just say there's a tornado on her titty?
Where my Alan Jackson fans at
Shit song shit music Video
🤮
Pls put a shirt on god 1:51
I wonder if she's wearing a bra 😂😂
She is definitely making fun of Country Music
Is this the official video?
C'est une pure arnaque ce "clip"
I don't care if this is a country song. It is made by Beyoncé and  sounds chill、good. By the way just wishing that she will drop the visuals, it's time to let people connect with her project.
WOW this sucks and people really like this??
This literally sounds like a movie soundtrack 🎉🎉
Love it ,so catchy
For all you hillbillies expecting this to be a video, read the word visualizer.
Tune
Yea no!
This.... is awful
Omg it really is Franklin 😂😂😂
Love it ❤
No I heard it on radio and liked it so I came searching for it
3:17 Star Light Zone? lol
????????????
How tf is this country?
Cultural appropriation
Came here to match the melody with Johnny Cashs song
This shit ain't  country
lol THIS NOT FOR U  U U U U U U U U
Thanks for making my day! And sing a song from my heart! BEAUTIFULL! And song SO WELL! All the best to Beyoncé
Sending hate from San Diego
Too revealing dress… don’t like it ,, the song is really cool though
This aint country music. Listen to the older artists like Hank Williams for example. Thats country. Beyonce isnt. Go back to what you know Beyonce. Let the legends of country live on
Yessssssssssssss❤
Stupid video!!!!
Not country just crap Stick to what you can do which isn't much musical
🤮🤮🤮video looks like soft porn. Song lyrics music is definitely Country
Sorry videos shit sorry again  why!!! Do this !!! All the dancing people are doing to this song ,I thought the video would be brilliant 😮what a let down
Taking shots at the right 🤣🤣🤣🤣
oo efsane video :Sd
What the hell is happening
She so desperately wanted to show azz and she did.🙄🙄🙄
Cool.😎 ✨
U gotta be kidding me 😂😂😂😂😂
Interesting Beyoncé very interesting
That doesn’t sound. Country.
Wtf is this video
This sounds like pop music k thought it was gonna be country.
“Oooouuuu”
I'm stuck 😢
This ain’t COUNTRY MUSIC… sorry 😢
I love this songgg 2:03
This is the worst song I've ever heard No surprises why she had to get her norks out to sell this steaming turd
Just because Beyoncé is singing it doesn’t make it good.
I'm actually in Texas right now thank you for making this song so much for me 👏🏽👏🏽😄😄😄
Reverse Cultural Appropriation.
Definitely, they are selling sex on that video.
Nah she doesn’t sound good doing country. Her voice ain’t country enough
Franklin?
Sorry but who in Texas drive a Lexus ?
This is an objectively terrible song and video.
Trash
No thank you!  The song suck, the video suck....
I'm confused. 😂
This song sounds exactly like animals from moon tricks
Just titties on repeat.
I actually like this song better than a lot of her others & I don't like country music. It's good sound for her voice.
To me, it is not really country. She is an excellent artist and performer, but I am not feeling this one. I am a huge fan of her, but I don't feel country. I love me some country too.
I like the song and music. Video sucks. Sorry. She can do better than this.
No offense great song WHERE IS THE BRA
Til tok ruined this song already
I still don’t understand the hate with this song
Why!!!!!?
Well she tried.
Very well might be the worst song I’ve ever heard in my life
Dumb shit
Nice. Just Nice.
What makes this country?
People who are here not for the video. There better be no like on this comment 👇
0:22 I realized that it’s on repeat
I dont care if this is not a real country music or whatever, I love this song.
She made me a country girl
The fact she did the same thing the hole time
Then tatas 😳
country girls don't "dress" like this and lyrics show her true colors
Not country music
Absolutely boring and isn’t country , doesn’t make sense the video
This isn't country.  What a joke.
She forgot her short
Pew pew pew
Sounds like crap
The biggest thing that comes with a country song is the accent which she doesn’t have. No matter how much she wants to leave the pop genre she can’t.
Who made the song? It is a hit
Like it
Cant just fucking call it a video?
This song might literally be making fun of country. But it reminds me of some John Mayer tunes.
This song sucks it is not country imo!
This is not country far from it  lol
You have ruined country music for everyone. You are a terrible singer.
😂omg🤦‍♀️
Brasil
Lets listen 16 carreages❤
❤ just Beyoncé. Love it
It's not a country song. It's a pop song and terrible one at that.
TikTok brought me here
Hey It’s Franklin  Iykyk
Wow lol…music videos used to tell a story. wtf is this lame gay shit
Beautiful song, not feeling the wardrobe.  Normally I love her outfits
Too trashy for me and doesn't sound so great.😢
Sucks
❤❤❤
Why do her boobs have to be the main attraction??? Seriously
I.  Love.   youuuuuuuuuu
This sounds like the franklin theme song lol
Sorry but this track is just horrible
Reach me the feather everything makes me  feel so free get up and  walk in this brokens dreams and make better
awesome song, you have lots of faith in the jacket.....lol
Lol, whats this?
Someone has been working on a boob😮 job
🤮🤮🤮🤮
What a mockery of real music.
This is terrible. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Put on some clothes too, dang……you have kids now. Set an example and stop trying to sing country, you can’t. This is not your genre and it sounds horrible.
Or your Caddy pickup! There is no end to the attempt to BS the American cowboy and the middle nation home land!
One blow of wind and it’s done it’s over
Stop hating.you no your all singing this song in your head even when your trying to sleep.good night texas
this sounds like an introduction to country song.... Like just testing the waters and doing it in her own way.  she is paying homage to the genre just like she did with other genres like  African beats.  i think she did a good job with having the steady beat that you can line dance to. Country music has soul to it and she delivered.  I am not a super fan f Bey but i respect the work she puts in. .... i bet some folks would love it if Taylor Swift did it...... Just wait for the album an i feel like she will bless yall ears with some good music.
Sucks
this isn't country it's pop
Looks like a pop stars' version of what she thinks country music should be.
Reminds me of Something in the Water by Brooke Fraser.
Buena canción, para el vídeo tan equis
O hell Yeah
You kill it everyone is doing the dance and I did it
This "song" is the biggest pile of shite I've had the misfortune of having to hear.
I ain’t country for nothing
This is the dumbest video. It's a waste of money. Nothing country about this. Sad
This needs to go in WTF genre 😂
Well done Beyonce great rolemodel for women 😂 is this what defining a woman is? Meanwhile my daughter gets shamed for breast feeding her week old son at a cafe the other day.... but this shite is acceptable? Stop sexualising and objectifying women ffs.
Skibidi toilet is better
I just wanna know why is the same clip playing over and over again
Beyoncé has more trust in the vest jacket, than i have in my life
Put on a bra
If my dad heard this, God rest his soul, he would be say... "What is this????"  .  I grew up with my dad playing old school country artist.  He would definitely say "this isn't it."
😡😡😡😡😡
Like if your here from the little girl mana waving🤣
Fake country music
Ils ne se sont pas creuser la cervelle pour ce clip, j'ai été saoulée😮
Boring video
I miss the other Beyoncé… we need to stop getting ghost writers cause this ain’t it sis-
This is a country song. People just aren't used to heavy/powerhouse vocals on a country track. Just because something doesn't have 'twang' doesn't make it a full pop record. But you can hear the country in it, especially in the other song, which I enjoyed more. It's a good opener; I can't wait for the album
All those white producers, all the terrible songs, and she finally got one who understood what her vocal register did best. She finally sounds good.
It's catchy. It's more pop country than actual country but it's catchy
She's disgusting No Class !Not Something I Would Ever Buy Or Promote!
I really love your song this so much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Song shit...video shittier! 👎👎👎👎
oh well, even if she came to my casino, it would be armageddon
Why she can’t be bothered to wear anything ? Rich ppl like to be naked with all that money! Crazy
Compare this song with country music STADIUM, NOT ARENA SUPERSTAR  MORGAN WALLEN  LIVE IN LEXINGTON singing "Whiskey glasses " and "The way I talk" live in a SOLDOUT STADIUM  he says Beyonce will be a great country singer and said he loves her style.
this song is trash and a disgrace to country , not even country 💀 LIKE if you agree
ПОЧЕМУ ОНИ ПОСТОЯННО ГОЛЫЕ? ЗАЧЕМ ЭТО ПОКАЗЫВАТЬ?ЧЕГО ОНИ ДОБИВАЮТСЯ? ПРОСТО УЖАС ПАДЕНИЕ НРАВОВ ОНИ НЕСУТ В МАССЫ ИСПОРЧЕННОСТЬ,КАК И САМИ!
Won’t lie! I was a little surprised to see Beyoncé in this music category. With that said, this song makes me wanna two step/hip hop dance all at the same time! ❤
Love this One 😂❤❤❤❤
I hate this song!
,,this aint ohio,,🎶🎶
Omg❤ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😊
Laziest video ever…what’s selling this song…hooters. 🙄
This aint country. This is cultural appropriation
Overated...
Country?
country gurrllllllllll 🤠🤠🤠🤠
who still listerning in 2024
When is the Music Video release!?
❤❤❤
Trash
Where's her clothes😂
One eye cover, Illuminati symbol.
Beyonce eu esperava mais de você
Ok, I do love the Bee, but how in the hell this is a number one on the charts, is wayyyu BE-yond me and speaks greatly to the BS of music industry.
I am traumatized 😮 horrible...
Put some clothes on
What was she thinking ??? This seriously sounds like total shit
Nothing says country like a Lexus.. 🤣😂 She has a beautiful voice, but this is not a country song, this is Country/Pop at best but more on the Pop side.  I do wish her continued success and luck, but This is not for every one.. and its not for me. But hope she is able to make a few hits. Good luck to her :)
This is genuinely such a bad song😭😭 I swear people only like this because of the creator
It's not country bless her heart.
Faltou criatividade.!
Man she made a country fan! I love it.
Franklin the turtle got back
This is a insult to country music.. park your Lexus omg it don't even sound country.. sorry but this is stupid..
Just like the rest of her music, this sucks
Lol this song sucks 😂 how brain dead do you have to be to like this dribble
Im not saying she ain't good and i love the song but please Beyonce put some bloody clothes on woman
Just beautiful ❤
It looks like the video is in the loop she could’ve done more stuff😮😮 I was just about to just click off
This video is trash 🗑
This isn’t that good.  The only reason it’s passable is because she can pay top tier musicians to create tracks for her
Awful video put me off the song 🤷‍♀️
Alright dude what the flip
Love ❤️ the song but the so call video TRASH. Expected way more and better from B truly disappointed it has nothing to do with the song
Ai generated type
Aaaaww noooo. Have I just been converted to the religion of Beyonce 😮
Nah...that ain't it bro
Any one from TikTok gather here....I love you diva Beyonce ❤❤
Country music sucks. THIS BULLSHIT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE
Stop showing so much skin. Cover-up something. Have some respect.  Js
Does anyone remember the name of the radio station... Never mind. I'm sure Bey was grateful for that little bit of controversy. 😂... Whooo!!!
Dont ever trust a man dressed like that..
Thx for a great song, Welcome to Country,I love the big middle Finger to Tay Tay the pop tart.
This music not for her 🤪👏
It's a miss for me
She’s a joke, stay out of country music.
Is Beyonce trying to be white singing g country music?
I am not American, I understand this might be strange for some of us to hear a black woman sing country music, but art isn't about the skin colour or race but about creating a whole new world right out of your imagination and heart that others may enter !   The groove and the beat are fantastic in this song !   And what is art if not an inspiration and feelings it causes you to have, and she has just nailed that !
Gabbage her work 10/15 is 100 times better this is her losing her control an going with the system. "DONT WORRY WE STILL MAKE U NO1" got the marketing money
Let’s go queen🇺🇸🎉👏
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Love it sooo much I love country and never hear it much in uk and radio played it my eyes lit up 🔥 🫶
Et dire que tout a commencé avec les Jones et leurs burgers 😅
This ain't Texas ain't no hold em  There's a tornado in my city. Hit the basement that shit ain't pretty.  Mad wisdom bruh 😂
Not much to this video. The same image drawing an imaginary spark shooting pistol over and over again. 🤔
That's not ddncing--it's just dumb boob flaunting.
Sucks!!!!!! This trash woman needs to stop messing with country music.
Cloths would be nice.
This is literally trash. Why is Beyonce doing country now? She cant do country, it doesnt even sound right. But because shes Beyonce every one thinks its amazing.
She is racist against white people
This is the ultimate example of how stupid people are..she doesn’t do anything, and feels the need to barely dress. Don’t even have to finish this. This world is so corrupt
Ah, i get why she didnt get any credit at the cmas. This isnt country at all. This is just her kinda singing with a yeeyee beat
This music has been haunting me... it's been topic in every shorts for a whole week XD
Beyonce: “I’ll be damned if I can’t slow dance with you”  Me: “Bless you”😂😂
goes hard on mute🗣️🗣️🗣️
Good song.  Terrible video.  IMHO
She starts the whole video with illuminati symbols 🤮
Worst f****** song in history
You can tell after her world tour she got her check from J.z. An had a 20mill make over even her eyes look different. Must have pinned her eyes back to look younger poor soul
this doesn’t sound country or have anything to do with the country music. Almost sounded like the African-American version of country music.
Not sure why you feel the need to be showing so much... sex sells I guess
No tenía tiempo pa grabar el videoclip que lo hizo una vez y lo dejo en bucle😅 la canción guapísima pero el videoclip no trasmite lo que trasmite la canción
Don't look at sound
Ope....She forgot her pants and shirt again.     🤦
Yep I had to come here to confirm the world is coming to an end
Good on yeh Beyoncé, I just love the sound of walls crashing down 😂
Bella canzone, ma preferisco i video con il balletto che fanno le persone su tiktok.
The Ending part is 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾 solargentic, photogenic, shoot
This aint Texas… and this AINT COUNTRY.
She needs to leave Country Music Alone!!!!! 😤 , and really dressed like that.... come on 🤮
hello, I just noticed that the beginning of the instrumentation resembles that of the cartoon Franklin the Turtle... nice homage!
My stomachs been hurting and i need to throw up this song did the trick thank you queen
What a song this it is some thing went wrong
Love u bee n hive love it Can’t wait for March29th luv🥰😘
Wow. This video is terrible
This isnt country. Quit helping ruining it.
I'm so tired of Beyonce there is nothing she can't do I love her down now country endless boundless talent hee hawww
I like the song!
Looks great for a stripper!
Stupidest song I ever heard -
Stay in your lane, what is this shit 😭😭😭
Oui
I love you
NO THANKS!!!!!!!
I think she did this for a reason so stay alert ⚠️
Has country music also sold out, becoming a nude show? I always believed country music to be conservative but eish that's gone to
The BEST s p film trailer EVER!
Awesome song ❤
The song is fine but I don’t think she needs to dress that way.  Just my opinion.  Why?
She's bringing eye patches and country back! Yeeehaw!
Took some thinking this video 🤣
OMG "gob-smacked" What is worse the video or the song!
sorry beyoncé and country fans but this is one of worst songs i’ve ever heard…
I'll try coming again and listen to the rest of it for now .... I cant
cheapest video ever😜
Beautiful lady, great voice. Why does she have to dress like a call girl?
Like the song the video is absolute crap so I'll continue to listen but watch??dont think so
Cuando la pereza llega. Ni que me graben!!!....
Welcome to the country music market
that's it?
Who came from TikTok? 😊
How is this a country song?
This is some hardcore pandering. And it´s done wrong
WOW I LOVE UR BRA WAIT A SEC… U DONE’T HAVE A BRA OR T-SHIRT LIKE WHAT THE FUCK!
It's magic seeing Beyonce go country! What a time to be alive. 🎶 🤠
She obviously had to rush off somewhere 5 minutes after they started filming.
Ma femme l'a écoutée j'ai cru que c'était une publicité... Affreux... Le décolleté ne fait pas tout malheureusement
This is weak. Keep showing same thing.
Good song cuz she is a great artist. America debating if this is country is hilarious. Just cuz it has horses, leather, acoustic guitar and mentioned Texas doesn't make it country. It has also not brought to light having black representation in country. Kane Brown has been doing for a while and Darius Rucker even longer. No hate but this is easily a pr play
Mainstraim rats here cant help them self... This is really a crap. Ain't no music.
Add this proves the adage: Stay in your lane.
Her song kind reminds me of the milk adds tune. But sorry, this country genre does not really suit her vocal type 😬
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Can’t stand it 😂 sorry 🤷🏻‍♀️ very sad music video and all over my fyp on TikTok. Everytime it’s on a video I scroll.
And then I heard the version of Davina Michelle and I love it so much more (including her outfit).
Is that all it takes to make a video, walk out on stage half clothed, never say a word, and do it over and over and over again??? 😮
this song truly has a beautiful message telling being to quit fighting and meet her in the middle. she seems to lament not having the ability to dance with "you"- as in the people she has lost to extreme political tribalism tearing families and communities that used to get along great  apart.....the media has mastered propaganda and getting people's blood boiling so they temporality lose critical thinking and are just feeling whatever emotion that segment was meant to evoke. fear anger resentment malice etc....the more intense the emotion, the less the critical thinking. this snowballs pretty quickly and if you look at american society today you   will see what i mean.    we need to make a habit of consuming news, or any content with the questions "why is this making me feel right now." "what is this segment trying  push and why?" " who benefits from people believing or buying into the  thing"   it seems like everyone just goes straight to the  "he's a Satanist" or "she's baby killer" ,go for the throat - "i know you did but what am i?" elementary school attacks at each other in politics BUT MOST PEOPLE F&(KING BUY IT. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.   im totally trying to make an acoustic cover of this song XD
bellisima!!!!!!!
I don't get it.
I like this song but its not country.
Nothing original.  Trash made by a puppet w 14 writers
I love country 🎵  songs ❤
Weak...weak...weak... Your music has not been jammin for a long time Yuck
All I i can say is, damn!!
I wish she would have done a real country music video…luv Bey but this is just a replay of the same vid shot. The song is fire 🔥 but the video is not really a video. Please grace us with a real video. Why would I want to see her half dressed; shooting a shot from her fingers over & over again? Makes no sense. There is no country bar you would feel comfortable wearing that outfit. She probably put $50 on this so-called Video on a wonderful song 😢❤
If cero effort 0️⃣ would be a song video 😂
Worst music video ever of hers.....
Good song, but terrible clip...shes not doing anythink, not even any dancing...my gosh!  Same thing over and over☹️
The video sucks big time. Awesome song the video ruined it.
Oh the irony - Taylor went secular and Bey going country
I think Beyoncé has nothing else to offer, but nudity.
YEEAAAAAAHHHHHH BAAAAAABAYYYY 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY BESTIE AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLIENTS 😍 💓 TOSHA BRADLEY AND MRS. MICHELLE WATSON. ❤ I LOVE YOU BOTH 😍 💋 ❤️ 🎉❤
Inadequate clothing….
resistance is futile
That's embarassing
I will submit
Awesome voice
she looks like borg
Thanks for coming to stream Texas Hold ‘Em tiktok :)
I don’t get the hype. 🤷🏽‍♀️
shame she spoilt this with sexualisation and crass lyrics.
I think I'm in love again
This is so stupid. Today's music sucks so much.
if Beyoncé can be country, I can be country
She trying to hard
This song sucks
The amount of symbols in this video 😮
Dude she aint even country shes a poser
On your mark... Get set... Terrible!!!
Worst song I’ve ever heard in my entire life
Lmfao 😂😂😂 this has to be a parody 😂 🤣
this song sucks
oh yeah follow this train
The amount of dislikes on this video gives me hope for humanity
I feel like she lost a bet…
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wtf 😂 this ain't country
I hate this audio
Thats awful
ts is ass
This just reminded me of the mean girls movie “Beyoncé~ 🫵🏻”
If her music is sooooo good why does she have to jiggle her boobies and be half naked for attention? Have some class girly!
This my type of Beyoncé bop.
Never will be true country music stick to pop
WTF is going on with our world !?!
Song is fire, her singing about shit her Fortune 500 bank account has no clue about is cringe
Beyoncé just took over country music!
I'm not a fan of country music but this is pretty nice.
❤❤
BRO why there a naked girl in there
This is cringe as HELL 😂
This is by far the worst song I have ever heard in my entire life. This is no where even remotely close to being country music.
Cmon Beyoncé stay in your lane
Everybody else hates this shit as much as me right ? This fucking sucks. Like, really bad.
Ahhhhh the worm is mad let’s run away
But I can really truly say is this is my sexy fiance came a long way and Nikki cannot beat that okay she's a favoritism she's a wannabe she cannot do a fiance do Beyonce got the music of the style got the ways got the rings got everything better than Nikki now I don't understand why fiance was why they saying a and B I think she's number one and more for real and I don't understand I don't have the figures ain't picking right but I think they by looking at her she's all that and she should have been number one in everything I love your piece commission❤😂🎉😢😮😅😅😅😅😅😅
YOU AINT PRETTY
OMG HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA AHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA HA HA
If this is country then Beyoncé is wearing appropriate shirt in this video.
Jay z and Beyonce at a dive bar said no one ever 😂😂😂😂😂
I was raised on country music and this isn't country. THAT SAID, with everyone being all negative about it, i had to finally come listen to it and I don't hate it as a pop song. I haven’t listened to Beyonce since I listened to Destiny's Child but she's still good! Just throw away the notion that it's supposed to be a country song and you should be able to enjoy it.
love yu🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bella m encanta esta canción no dejo de oirla😊❤
I like the song but the video could use some work
This is Franklin the fucking turtle
Nice try at making country music…but you did a great job at looking like a white women.
worst song I have ever heard in my life, music has hit a new low
She getting old, so she need to bare more of her body.
She hit a bull’s eye with this one !
Just no 😂
Texas dossent have basements😂
Gwiazda światowego formatu, teledysk jak wsiuk 😢
Solargenetic photogenic shoot the big event will be this year
Not at ALL country
You ain’t country… stop trying.
tá pra nascer uma música tão ruim quanto essa, pqp
I need therapy ahahahshshhashahwhahahahhshshahahshshshshahsjahahaha skibdi toilet its much good with my milk bears russians sodjsosowjdieodj dancing TRIPALOSKdjhvdj bkaoaoaoahahahhaahhahahahahahaa
Pure crap
Is this the real video?
For all the money that Beyoncé has, she made this trope video. I was expecting a good honky Tonk video with lots of lush cowboys. Disappointing to say the least.
Where is k michelle.. Beyonce song is bull shit My 5 year old can do better the f*** out of here. Y'all listen to anything She needs to go sit the fuck down
Period beyonce you got me and my mamma lit with this song
This is not COUNTRY.
Not bad
This easily has to be the cheapest and most boring music videi
so vulgar and banal...
I think that is pathetic. That woman is a mother. She should not put herself out there like that. I don’t care what kind of singer she is I’m embarrassed for her. I’m sure lobby we’re gonna hate but I can’t help it. That’s just my opinion and we all have them. She’s an amazing singer but my word where clothes
I love this song and also the remix by lydia
was she styled by Kanye? Or did she just forget to get dressed?
Miley Cyrus should sing this.
the end f@rking  rap is coming
Wow, Beyonce never fails to impress! The energy and passion she brings to every performance are truly unmatched. This song is not just  catchy, it"s empowering and has such strong message. Beyonce's  artistry continues to inspire me. Keep shining, Queen Bey!
true, you can dress like a lady of the night if you want to,  but don't expect respect
OMG this is ridiculous.at the very least wear chaps and a cowboy hat. Why are you trying to ruin country. JZ should hav dressed you..if he did than WTF.
Do it girl 🐎 you did your thing ❤
Me encanta la cancion pero es muy malo el.video
All monies for a good video went into her outfit! Her  outfit probably costs more than my home and she rocks it! Catchy song!
cringe
This shit sucks
No more music from grandma please😂😂😂
Straight trash! “Let me show my breast now” 😅😅😅
dont even texas destroyed my life
HELL NO DEFINITELY NOT COUNTRY WTF. BOOOOOOOOO
Why can't we get more action in this video
The song is pretty decent, but the video is awful!!! I feel like I got stuck in ground hog day…
My people have forgotten how to blush.  Sad
The day the music died.  Congratulations to the Devil. He has won yet another battle against any semblance of morality and godliness by totally subverting the gospel roots of country music. I don't blame Beyonce. She's just one of the useful minions who sold her soul long ago. Blame lies with the country music industry who has for years willingly, knowingly, unabashedly, even proudly pushed the moral bounderies of what was once upon a time country music.
I've played this all day with the top to my lexus down. You nailed this tune💃❤️🤠
This video must of took all week to shoot
Love the song, but that outfit is trashy and no country star would wear it.
All this screams is "If you wanna see my almost fully naked body then stay tuned and watch the video to my song cause that's all you will care to see anyway" Desperate as fuck lol.
Varför är hon halv naken
I wish I was that vest.  For real, for real.
slay queen
Some strawberries get more likes than this
Loop infinito
I HATE THIS SONG
this is the most annoying song i’ve ever heard.
جايين من التيكتوك 😅
0:39
1 gust of wind away from being a porn gif
HEY ITS FRANKLIN! 😂 what a rip off! Lame.
Das hat nix mit texas zu tun 😮
Eyes up here cowboy
I like it🌵
Ok I am from Texas don’t get it lol what is she shooting from her fingers ? And it’s repeated
This song is trash😊
Babe Legend Beyoncé
Once a boy 😅
Idk how I feel about this. I hate 98% of country music and thought for sure this was not the way she should go…. And yet… I think… I think I approve.
This is not country. Sorry B , stick to hip hop
Can't she at least put a shirt on??
La nueva canción viral de tiktok ❤
Whys everyone hating this song. Probs my favourite of hers and its encrypted with msgs!
How the hell.... The jacket wow only she can get away with that!
NEVER MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO AGAIN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯
Till the end that’s the only thing she did??? Seriously I was expecting a lot since everyone is making short videos of this😂😂😂😂😂😂
love  this
Nothing says country like being half naked 🙄
This really isn't country. She needs to stick with her regular kind of music.  It's sickening that ppl who are cowboy/cowgirl wannabes, disgrace the true cowboys. You can't just wake up one morning, and you are one. Doesn't work that way. Lose the cowboy hat Beyonce's, it's not you.
Absolute trash
An old western music video would go nice with this song
This song is so trash 🤮🤢
No matter how many times I tell YouTube I’m not interested in this shit song and these cringeworthy dances I keep getting them. It’s worse than the fancy like song
You are disrespecting yourself with your lack of clothing
Caca
I would of like to see Beyonce in country get up instead of
This video blowz
This music haunts me 💀
She's getting older May be she only got that one move left?
Awful, this shit is fucking awful
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This crap sucks
Beyonce had a great career and she really had to make this song 😭😭
Stupid video
Love it
lol stick to pop music
Who’s here because of tic toc
It's pathetic how the Country music industry has been bastardized!!!
More Texas, not country.
What the hell is this? We're the rest of the video is a loop, definitely she didn't put a lot of tough on the lyrics as long they were rhyme she was ok 😅
Awesome song!
This song is taken from a Canadian cartoon “Franklin “. The song is called “Hey it’s Franklin “
Love the song. The wardrobe? Not so much. She ruins the song with that. Maybe a montage of folks doing the dance or her backup dancers doing the dance.
Love u always
wtf I don’t like her clothes at all
Im really tired of this boring ass song playing everywhere: please 4 the love of god, keep tiktok dance out of youtube shorts
Does not sound country. What's happening
Better than most country songs. Go industry Go
The Queen is not country,  because the real country singer don't have to be half naked to sing. She needs to go back to R&B. NOT COUNTRY QUEEN B NOT COUNTRY.
This ain't a country song if you think you listen to country because you listen to this then you need a reality check
I know right
O ya veo, esta canción es muy popular en TikTok en el área de México, es muy buena
The song is pretty. I like it. But the video. The outfit. She just slutied up country. Celebrities are just wearing less and less. It’s all about how close to naked they can get. What happened to the beautiful clothes. Beautiful hair and make up. Why has everything turned so slutty.  Like I said, the song and music. Love it. The outfits. Hate them. Let’s promote wholesome as sexy. There is a difference between sexy and slutty.
The video clip is trash
I think the video may be worse than the song😂
🤤🤤🤤😋😋
Gradually, being completely naked became style Statement..
Song 🤦‍♂️
Overrated af
Make a instrumental version of it
First time listening to Beyonce.. sounds like led Zeppelin playing southern rock.
pust some clothes on we don't need to see this
Im no prude but i feel the extra nudeness is because this song alone isnt enough smh and im a beyonce fan
I love Beyonce but im not feeling this....
We're you held at gun point to make this?
Holy Shit ! That's a catchy song !
This is legit biting Franklin. A cartoon of a turtle
Este es todo el video?? 🙄🤣🤣🤣 Naaaa!!!!
Good song but would've been better if done by someone eles...
Why is the video stuck??
I think the profanity is to much for Country other than that it May Be Country Maybe!!
😂 wow what a rubbush video disapponted  but good song
It’s not bad just exceedingly okay.  I miss when Beyoncé made great songs like countdown halo love on top
My new favorite
As a Texan MAN IDK HOW TO FEEL ABT THIS 😭
There ain't no B in real country
I thought she s gonna.pull her cherries out from the Jacket to get sm views and to be more sexyyy
Or else you jst wanted to be sexy and nude
You wore that jacket for formality
U no what
My fy page has given me a head ache with this song so I came here to get this over with forever
Great nice song!! In my opinion it is very successful, even if  Beyoncé don't push her tits out 🙄🤦🏼‍♂️🫣🤷🏼‍♂️
ENOUGH OF THIS BS ASS SONG!
I see people talking about her politics, who she supports etc… I’m 💯 a republican,but damn that’s one hella sexy woman..
She's white now
How many tries did it take to get the shot of her walking without Uhm.. something to be seen?
El vídeo No me gustó por un momento creí q iba a bailar como lo q hacen en riktok me quedé esperando esa coreografía 😂
น้ำคลาสสิกน้าแขกวิ๊บวั๊ส
Proof that this generation will listen to the audio equivalent of dogshit and swear it’s amazing. 👎🏻🤦🏻‍♂️
Este debe ser el video mas barato y simple de toda la historia, lo grabo una vez y luego el editor, copió y pegó🤣
That‘s the most boring music video I ever saw…
🥱🥱🥱👎👎👎👎
Hey it Franklin!!! Oh wait….
Radio:”This ain’t Texas” Me: “Turns off radio”
‘Visualiser’ how patronising
Just doesn't feel or sound like real country. Sounds like all her other music with a banjo added to the song.
Just cus it says Texas doesn’t make it country cus this ain’t a country song
Love the illuminati symbols lol
The stupid video ever
This song is stupid and awful go away girl...
I love the song , but the video is really trashy and slutty
Its whiteface
Why kind of shit is this song?????😢😢😢😢😢😢😫😫😭😭😭😭😭
Shes a good dancer, this video could have been done so much better
Someone please just pay her her billions so she doesn’t have to perform anymore. Creepy in every possible way.
Absolute dog shit
Wow this sucks
❤❤❤
Ohh admit it you all came here after your feed is filled with this music 😂
I feel like some of you are kinda 🐢... this is not meant to be a music video. Hence why its called a visualizer. 😱
Luv u Bey but this alot of BS
She is using nudity to promote the song. This is not country music!
Lo máximo... Recuerdo una escena de una película, donde una negra quería ser cantante de country y su hermana le decía, cuando has visto una negra cantando country... Ahora vean, un éxito Beyoncé...
Eski R&B tarzına dönmelisin Crazy in love,Deja vu, baby boys,Drunk in love, Beautiful liar eski şarkıların kliplerin çok güzeldi şimdi maalesef öyle değil çok kötü
This isnt country lol
SEX SELLS....
Low talent
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has dropped 4 spots to #5 for its 4th week on the Billboard Hot 100! Keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! 👑 🐝
Alls I can see is Satanic Symbolism in this.
By far the most boring clip ever. What in the world was this woman thinking?!
This is shit pop. It doesn't DESERVE to even have banjo in it. That's the only thing that BARELY gives this even a HINT of country. Stay in your lane and let Darius do his thing ma'am. You dont need to 'attempt' every genre. This has been absolutely awful. G'day.
Worst song ive ever heard
I haven't listened to Beyonce in a minute, incredible song!
Sounds like Send my love by Adele.
This is shit.
Damn❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your not a country singer
It's such a shame that her and Jay-Z sold their soul to Satan 30 years ago
This is the dumbest fucking song ever
Nice❤
Is this even considered a video of A list artist's?  Probably voice manipulated
Love the song, the arrangement, the harmonies, her talent and voice- but WHY this raunchy get-up????
This is not country. This is Beyonce! She has her own Genre
افشل فيديو كلب على الإطلاق
I don't get it!! What's this style video got to do with the song? Might as well just have made it a cover video. I don't want to watch Beyone half naked, I want to see what the lyrics mean by showcasing it visually 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
So Miley Cyrus and Beyonce switched roles? 😅
Da donna dico che è stupenda ❤
Any one else just see her doing  the same walk and stuff
It turned out very good 😂😂👏🏻👏🏻
This song sucks. Sorry, but the whole thing sucks. I gave it a listen before I decided.
This is ruining country music.
the official music of shorts. enough is enough.
the official music of shorts. enough is enough.
Is this it? The video? Really? I was soooo impressed with the song. Was going to post my appreciation until I saw this. Wtf🤷‍♀️ Is this the entire video or is it some sort of preview thing?????  Ok!!!! Update, phew, yes this is basically a preview promo. Jesus lol.
What a let down. B is capable and we expect so much more from her. This is a cop out. I nominate this video for a Razzie!!
Wow! Super song 😀
❤️⚘️🥂
Nice song
That’s it?! Come on B, we all know you can do better!
Amo mais que tudo 💚💚💚💚💚🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Go back to your own shifty music.
What a boring clip 🤔🫣🫣
This song sucks.
L song, a very thing bluds saying is cap
Horrible song
Nothing too special 😢
This is so bad
❤❤❤❤
Who came up with this video ? Terrible!!
Oh please stop using this song for everything. Pls my ears are bleeding
Question?in Texas do they walk around like that with their breasts uncovered?
Why it's vibing me of ‘GTA SA’
I'm sorry but is it just me because this sucks she is not a country star this is horrible just because of her famous name she thinks she can do whatever she pulls out of her ass and people buy it it's so pathetic
The song sounds more like a jingle than a song.  If she sings more contemporary songs then she’ll get more likes & sales.  i’ve always liked the tone of her voice.   She should focus on singing someone else’s songs.  Then we could hear her voice come through without the whole orchestra.
She brought trash to country
Jlo told em all in their occult meeting, "step up your game we get em with music by the masses"  then Beyoncé obeys...with switching genres.  Evil in the making....
I’m sick of this song. This video is even e annoying.
Garbage, an absolute shame.
Bey should stay away from Country music and put some fkn clothes on, she looks rank!! Shit song, shit video to match.
how much is tiffanys etc?80,000$?
The first line refers to Poker?
What a dumb video
This short clip must have been the only part he nips ain't show😂
Que pinche.....video
Damn these girls will go to any lengths man .not surprised
She’s making Texans look dumb😂
This isn't good at all is this on repeat
Smut

No just no..........
Now this isn't that bad she is showing too much boob but the record is good
Anyone else hear the Lumineers Ho Hey?
This is the worst supposed music video ever!  Is this supposed  to be talent?
Hey it’s Franklin.,
Bayou influences and sounds. This is not southern country why is people mad and if it was still why?
You call this Country?
Doesn't sound extremely country to me. It's ok
I’m no country fan but I know a diss song when I hear one 😂 “let’s hit the dive bar we always thought was nice” lmfaoo
This just seems like a mid life crisis to me
This song is really good, but the video is boring and repetitive. I won't watch it again.
Texas Hold,EM just keep going Texas 💪 💯
I love you Beyoncé
This is the first 🥇 time I ever heard this song 💖
Sell your soul for what's popular now.
Does she got to go naked to sell this album?

To each its own. Not for me but to each its own.
Terrible song
I hate everything that this person chooses to be.
Me gustó tu canción por el simple hecho de que hablas de Texas, lugar de nacimiento de mi tatarabuelo.
Not country music
no this is not texas
Catchy ass song 😂
This music video sucks🤮.......not talking about the song.  Her breasts are halfway exposed & they used the same clip over & over & over & over & over again.  Did she not have any other moves or ideas other than walking up & firing the same 2 fingers?  Is she afraid to do any other move & the double-sided tape coming undone? Making music videos today requires nothing more than being partially naked....no creativity on this one.
I love you baby ❤❤❤❤❤❤
So now she's wants to make country cheap and trashy?    This song sucks on its own merit but this is NOT country this is tacky
This Song Is So Bad You Should Stick To Pop
Love the song but the video is terrible
Wtf did I just watch
Who wrote this song? Really she put this song out😢
She could have at least dressed country.
I was waiting for something different to happen in the video and it's really a repetitive sequence of the same thing, although the song is good
Blud your are not country
Love the song but the outfit needs to go
O MY GOD. She butchered country music. Real country music does NOT sound like this! If you think this is how real country music sounds then listen to songs by real country artists  White horse-Chris stapleton  Drunk and I don’t wanna go home- Elle king   Burn down the house- dean Brody  Wait in the truck- HARDEY   Gunpowder and lead-Miranda lambert
Sucks
This is the worst thing I've ever listened to an who ever wrote this needs to be fired
It's garbage Tell her to pit some clothes on it's garbage
Did Texas hold'em net USA is singing is garbage
Tell Beyonce to get off the radio singing that hoedown Texas shit that shit is garbage
She did the walk one time after that, it was just on repeat
Yuck
I don't understand why she doesn't wear close my mom use to say honey leave something to the Imagination .she is beautiful she dose not have to look so cheep
Our people need to free their minds from European concepts
I need our stars to wake-up sing woke music
I like the song
WOW CANT BELIEVE BEYOCE IS PULLING A JAY-Z SHE SHE'S BETTER THAN THAT SMH IYKYK
❤❤❤❤❤
Yum fn yum - she's still got it ! My wrist is hurting
Beyonce never ever releases mid tracks, her discography is absolutely flawless! ❤
Reginald McDonald said God bless and keep up the great work out there coming from Jackson Ms. We got love for y'all down here to ❤🙏🏼❤️
Yes, and in my opinion. I think it's absolutely trash. I like alot of her music but this one, NOPE.
And she's from Houston 🤨
Amazing 🎉🎉
Poor Taste I n attemp to do country
this Not County
What a joke ! LMAO
This is not country music.
Beyonce no puede ser vaquera pq es negra
💜👌🏾
Grrrrreat... she's country now
Song is pretty cool but the video ... oh Maggie be quiet
Is she making fun of country music? Or is she serious?
Beyonce is trash.
This aint texas. You can get pregnancy care
Stupid song
No to the music, and no to the video 🤢
The song is good but why is she dressed in bin liners? Dressed may be a strong word here.
This ain't country.  It sucks.
So without the naked body nobody going to listen?  No need for this, I want see her dancing l like others on yt, this corny an cheap looking.  Tune catchy tho.
I like white people singing country music, no, I am not white.
Everybody uses this song on their YouTube shorts or tick-tok’s and it’s not even a good song
Worst video ever!!! 😂
Soooo this isn't country music. Charlet Pride, Darius Rucker could teach her country. .. maybe.
Just a wanking video😊
Nah this ain’t it lol I love all things Texas but nah can’t say I love this
I thought she was s p**n star
Creo que se olvidó la ropa antes de salir de casa....ESTÁ  EN BOLAS
This isn't country to me
HER VOICE!!!!❤❤❤❤
is about last night reading All is over is the end of humanity no more love no more faith no more feelings that is my little black death ,😀😅🤣😂dark days al is over no mor feeling nothing more to believe ,  Death , that is my little black death  🎵🎶
Tf this bs🤣🤣
That's horrible.We need a miracle please Sweet Jesus stop this .
Ain’t nothing country about that! Looks and sounds like crap!
She’s almost naked cover up
Doodoo
Everything about this is bad lol
TF is this?
This is not country. This is pop
Country music isn’t for you. Stay where you belong
so she's jumped on the country music wagon because that's hot right now
Well this is another video I will watch with the volume off an just watch ❤
👎👎👎👎👎👎🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤
Yes B 🔥
There are literally memes all over FB about this song being awful. The first verse is catchy then it just goes downhill.
No need for nudess really
This is far from country she just totally ripped off a tune from someone else who is a Blues Singer and made it part of this song and called it her own just because you can do something doesn't mean you should actually do it. That is why today all singers that make mainstream music I don't have any respect for, for hey don't have any talent at all just look up real music like Blues Jazz Classical Opera now that is where people have true talent.
Un clip vraiment nul comparé à la musique
This is not country and never will be and she definitely is just putting on country face!! All of you people who love this and her new country face don’t know what real country is or ever has been! Try to actually learn what real county music is before you try to act country!!
Wtf is this video🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I just came across this now I'm addicted! Hubby pee..d off with me dancing 😅❤
Not country!  Sad
She should wear clothes like normal people do.
My mum hates this song bc ur trying to be country and u r better at diff things I agree with her it’s anoyying
Isn’t she almost 50?
This is the worst shit I’ve ever seen
This song SUCKS SO BAD! Like absolutely horrible. Sorry girl you should not sing country this is not country at all ! LMAO
What a boring music video
Why doesn’t she put some clothes on. So unnecessary
This is the proudest moment for blue ivy seeing her mother scantily clad.now that is a rebuttal whenever she wanted to go out wearing short skirt. "Mom you barely cover your lady lumps and hoohaa in video viewed by millions."
O Jezu dramat 😮
plz delete this
Do you need to use profanity and dress less provocatively.... Then I might respect it.
Fake country music
Country as a community help each other out an I'll  always stand up for my neck of the woods bring your ass to roy wa an give me a hand in this back yard if your so Country ...
Perfeita
What's an official visualizer?
What in the actual fuck is this nonsense?
Gretchen Wilson is country music this is like stepping in dog shit with red bottoms
I love you queen b
Black people getting too comfortable.... stay in your lane brown skin girl... leave our shit alone
Quit appropriating our white culture.
This is trash
I didn't think Beyoncé made bad songs. I stand corrected.
Adding a new level of sleaze to already sleazy country music
Likes to Play Poker ♣️ ♦️ ♥️   and Card Games  !
Whooooo.. 🥴 i was waiting for her to do that trending dance with that outfit 😶‍🌫️
I can't believe people like this.... pure garbage
This song sounds pretty familiar... like an old song from years ago...
⭐⭐✨🇧🇷🇧🇷
Wait this can't be her video!
Bounce, stay on your genre of music. Your no Tammy, Loretta or Dolly. Just bringing trash to a already trashy so called “country music”
OK, I just don’t understand why y’all came to her page to hate. if you don’t like it don’t watch the video you’re giving her more money by clicking on the video and why y’all hating Beyonce is number one on Spotify so what’s the point of 80 million people like this song. So  a little bit of y’all hate  not gonna change nothing. Y’all are very childish like very To be hating going to 42 year old, trying to make music for her fans crazy
Smh lol horrible
If people turned on Tay;or Swift Why would we want this now. Sorry It might get attention for a minute Still NOPE
The clip not too much effort just that... During the whole song
This song makes me physically feel ill
She can't sing and walk at the same time. She can't even lip sync at the same time. Horrible.
Disappointing overly pornculture visualiser.  But hey thats all hollyweird normalizes. Sad.
Did U get my message? LOVE THE SONG ; Praying it will be #1 ; Got to purchase the magazine at CVS;  PHILIPPIANS 4:3-5 Gentleness  1 John 5:20 2 John 1:1-6 Congratulations Beyonce on  Being a Mom and a Successful Businesswoman  Happy New Yearsssssssssssssssssssss amd Happy Women's Month March 12 2024  TO do List: Concert
Dogshit and Lazy that is all
I LOVE  THIS SONG ❤❤❤❤
Plagiarism 😳
cool song😊
Video is ridiculous. Dress country, boots shorts, hats.   This just sucked.
She is back with a bang. 😱
Musik toll 🎉🎉🎉 Video einfach nur einfallslos 😢
One of the shittiest songs I’ve ever heard, you couldn’t pay me to listen to it
So disappointed in this video. So much talent and nothing more to show for it
This is Franklin
Ahhh country gone wrong 😑
Man thats where the ruffles went
Keep this trash out of country music. She could never beat Taylor Swift, so now she wants to try and join her…..oh wait Taylor doesn’t do country anymore. 😮 Oh well Beyoncé stay in your lane
Good to see you back beyonce😍
Este es el video oficial?😮😢
Stupid video and song sucks
I just want to know how does she feel about her daughter and son seeing her mom's boobs like this not really a  role model put some clothes on you've got a great voice why do you think you have to be naked to sell music ?
Is it Pop Music or Porn?
Good music. Terrible outfit.
I’m confused. This is the same scene over and over? Maybe this isn’t the original video?
Love it 🎉careful one wrong move and everyone will get a flash 😂
Is that the whole video? Just the same clip over and over?
Byonce aqui no brasil te amamos demais um grande abraco aqui de salvador bahia❤❤
My eyes  🙈
You know, the more you cover the more men and women have to have the mystery of a women's figure. Not that you look bad but the video is <_< really? Why not do different outfits at least instead of just one same... idk. I'm a 24F btw.
Let your song speak for itself.  If you need to show off your body to get attention to the song then your just showing that you don't trust the music to speak for itself.  I personally like the song. But no need for that.
Sucks
Best idea across the board is to collab with Miley on this just for a special radio-track
🎉
I need the Beyoncé implants
The more you watch, the more you notice and learn to expect.  💚✨
Vraiment bof🥲
One eye symbol 😉😵‍💫☠️👿🤟🏼👌🏼👁️🖕🏼
Am I the only one who actually enjoys this song? 😂
Wait this is the Billionaire who refused to stand at the singing of the National Anthem at the most expensive seats at the Superbowl with her Husband JayZ and his Nappy hair do. No this song does not cut it for me!
Her voice sounds great but this song is terrible in my opinion.
como pode eu não gostar de sertanejo e amar essa?
Plagiarized from Johnny Cash, guess Kat Williams wasn't wrong.
Even in a 6 second loop disgrace of a music video, she still managed to slip in some illuminati symbolism. Nice Beyoncé.
Titties!!!!!😂
BEST SONG BY BEYONCE EVER ❤
😂😂😂😂😂
What a whorish power hungry individual
This song actually hurts my soul ...music today.... is truly dead
This song is too vulgar to be considered country music
What the hell is this video?!
Wear proper clothes
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is this really supposed to be country??
I love Beyonce but this just isn't her
Why she is famous ,
So the the words bitch and shit are mainstream country now?!?! Beyoncé STAY IN YOUR LANE BRO!!! Leave country to REAL country music artists. Video sucks too. Gotta be 1/2 naked cause that’s all that’s going for this video which ain’t saying much!!!!
Zajímá hudba text   bylo by lepší tancovat  a ne vypadat jak E50 ❤️❤️👍👍
Fun fact: playing this song on slo-mo makes it even better!
This is horrible, absolutely ZERO country in this….
She’s got to be desperate to stay relevant
"Put your tittie up Adele"
The whole point of a country song is that its about country....the place. The background. The pain. The struggle. The love.Tye break ups.The history.  The cliches. To sing "pop your lexus" is just dumb....a country style song does not make a true country song.
They had the opportunity to use this video to showcase Beyonce going country - and all they gave was a fifteen second clip on repeat?  I'm not even gonna criticize the outfit. But she is one of the top artists of her era, married to of the best producers of his generation-  And this is the best they can do?  It's giving disdain.  It's giving come at me so I can complain that you came at me...  It's giving I don't care.  But the bottom line in country music is *feeling*, is *emotion*, is ABSOLUTELY caring!  It doesn't matter about what and it doesn't even matter whether you're right or wrong but it absolutely matters that you put your emotions up front.   And there isn't any emotion in this video *nor in the song*.  And that's why people are saying this isn't country.
Bom demais viu😍😍😍
Tf is this trash
Haters gonn hate
LMFAO
If the intent of this “video” was to make people uncomfortable…you’ve succeeded. Absolutely cringe. Put some clothes on.
Eso fue todo su video?  🤷🏻‍♀️
What color is her shoes
Linda melodia... Amo-te bey
Did not like.
I don't know how she is so comfortable in this outfit
This video makes Beyoncé looks slutty! You’re a beautiful woman, you don’t need to dress overly exposed. Thank about your children and the way they view you.
Me:I ain't a big fan of coutry music- Me after listening to Beyonce's new song:well did you know mah dad's a cowboy 👁️👄👁️
Why is she dressed like a P....Star ??? 🤦‍♀
Put some clothes please
Next time, Beyonce, wear something less... Remove the jacket and undies. Cos this is where it's going.
Let beyonce show her body. Her body, her show.
Wtf why she's nude
😅  I was thinking about that too and then realised that it is the only thing I 😢🎉😢😮😮 but then it turns into the next one so I’m just not really happy with the outcome haha
dont you let them do it
This song is so overrated
😡
WTH? Did she lose a bet or something?
She Shouldn’t Have Sold Her Soul.
Hey it's Beyoncé....
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Illuminati
Beyonce your soo wak
I love the riptide vibe <3
Didn't she sing a song with the words that says " Nasty. put some clothes on I told you.."? Fame and money always find a way to skew your morals....
.
This aint country but it does smell like manure.
Boring ass "song"
The song doesn’t match the visuals like at all😭
Baphomet imagery is a big L
This aint even country. It's throwback pop from like the 2010s. Shit sucks. Smfh.
Love the song so much
One eye symbolism
It's 4 minutes of the same few verses repeated. Boring
Blu didn’t suck a ounce out of them titties
good song but the music video is really inappropriate
💩
Nothing exciting about the song lol and the outfit please next music video come out naked wtf also anyone else was able to spot the edit by her chest area ? lol
So Beyoncé basically wrote the lyrics like her usual type of songs but just made a “country” melody and sang it in a “country” tone?
She really be lookin like the main villain of Power Rangers Time Force.
What the actual hell is this?
Man jay z is really needing to learn how to throw pipe. He must off his game, if his chick is comming off like this now
Actual trash
Song and video... Beautiful
I hate country but this is adorable 🥰
This is hot dogwater
Director: how much money do you want to spent on the music video?  Beyonce: about 30 dollars tops😂
How about no?
She's lets the song speak for itself, without a story
Bloody awful video! 🤨 Doesn’t make much sense
Put some clothes on girl.Dont you get enough attention?
Love the music but not the dress
I guess beyonce is country now?
Idk i came to hate and i dig afterall.
This was an easy video. One minute one take. Was of time to watch
I Would have loved to dress her for this ❤
Nothing like 👑 B ❤❤❤
This aint texas. This aint country either
The style and song give mixed signals but overall nice job 👍🏽
Just as horrible as your average regular country music I guess.
She could be watching Yellowstone, 1883, 1923 and decided to create this song.
this reminds me of bo burhams pandering song
Since when was Beyonce a country singer
Weird and dumb.  Put a shirt on.
I had to put it on the newest comments to see the people agree with me because they have the other comments groomed so perfectly
La mejor cancion❤
My mom and sister went to her concert
Hey itsss franklinnnnnn
This ain't country..
Not a country song it’s fake country
This hits different on mute.
This shit is ass she has nothing to do with country music
The beginning tune is from Charlie  boy by Ben Dakota Rogers
Not the no bra💀
I was not a fan of the whole pop country thing but this is too far what happened to real country we need another outlaw
It is the song from Franklin.  Lol.
Leave country to country artists. She's been washed up for a while.
Pretty sure you still need clothes in Texas 😭💀
LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE
Stripper beyonce😂
Since when tf did she become country 😂💀💀
Darrius Rucker has more class than this trash.
A.I.
I didn’t like the song until I saw the Jacob guy’s dance that he made to it that now everyone it seems is trying to copy.  But now I love this song!!  Beyoncé you could have done a much better video.  Sorry. This was disappointing.
It's official country music is dead 😢 r.i.p .... George strait and Alan Jackson were right.
JayZ is going crazy rn
Black people aren't allowed to do country...
I’m sorry, but this is more country than the stuff I’ve heard for a while now. I was introduced to country in the 90s era. George Strait and Garth Brooks to name a couple…
Wtf this is horrible
Well that was trash. Made it 35 seconds in.
Unpopular opinion,  but I can't stand this song

Crap song crap clip
This ain’t Texas  Is saying the opposite of what every Texan has ever said The slogan this is Texas this ain’t Texas fuck you that’s unpatriotic and I don’t even live in Texas. I could see if you said this ain’t Texas this is Georgia yeah Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina some other state Mississippi, Louisiana straight up this ain’t Texas is unAmerica Don’t be a bitch who the fuck are you talking to nobody wants to dance with that guy get away with calling him a bitch and then meet her on the fucking Dancefloor You’re not gonna respect yourself in the morning Sounds like a bad inside joke
ANYWAYS, Beyoncé still making y’all mad, and she number 1 on the charts well doing it, THANK YOU BEYONCÉ!!!
The fact nobody knows what a visualizer is, is actually making me laugh, yall that dumb LMAO😭
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Wow The video budget for this song must have been 6 pence.
Sad attempt to be like Taylor Swift    Team Swift ❤
Not feeling it. And the outfit . Come on B.
Fellas, what colour was the song
love her songs
Guys check out this remix of Aaron Smith - Dancin by AnOnYmO --> https://youtu.be/qswUL4-Di2s
Bro, I never knew this was Beyoncé💀💀💀💀💀💀I’m actually so dumb.
🤠
🗑️🗑️
Cultural appropriation overload
I'm a little bit sad that she didn't do anything different
The song is nothing country…you can’t be cold in a heat wave, and no country try person ever drives a Lexus. You know your music sucks when you’re desperate enough to go try country.
So American
Sounds like r&b
what a great fuckin' tune
Guys this is just too stupid
DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS OS,BUT IT'S NOT COUNTRY, GUESS SHE THOUGHT SINGING ABOUT PLAYING CARDS AND WEARING A COWBOY HAT IT WOULD BE COUNTRY,GOT NEWS FOR YOU B,YOU HAVE TO BE COUNTRY TO SING COUNTRY.
Man, this is garbage!!!!!🗑️
Es el vídeo musical más horrendo que he visto en muchos años
Love it....country music getting back to its roots! 🥰😎😎😘
These are all jokes they have to be this is the 2nd one I have seen with her just doing the same thing over and over again
Why are y’all so dumb in the comments, and y’all old and white to hating😭😭😭
.. инсигни-ата "регалия скиптър" при "Белисама" е само един мой на един неин бацил⚫ 💦.📍.🌩🦄., а при нас "горе" е с два мои на единадесет.....
What rubbish she wearing???
🤠
THIS SONG IS SOOOOOO WACK! I can't stand beyonce!
Worst. Song. Ever.
this is 💩 sorry Beyoncé , maybe it might be time to consider retirement 😬 like 2 albums ago 😅
one eye symbolism not many clothes on ✅✅✅✅
Cute song..this video is disturbing. Those that have eyes to see understand. Smh
Let's be honest Beyonce has  Lost her Way .  This song epitomises it .  it' lacks Soul n Heart ..  Give me  Chris Stapleton. all day .
Stay in your lane Beyoncé. Not a good video for country .
The song is great.... but is that the official video??
tune i love you your the best good look
How is this the video? Wtf??!
The worst.  How tf did this get 320k likes
Girl get dressed
The picture is sus
Ok....  Steal a beat... Ok
No.. She tried to put all country in one song .All while doing it standing there half naked..  Strong Pass  Cause that is not Country  that beat is a pop beat  -turnip- ..NOPE
You could have made the best video ever but you made this shit..
This is as bad as the song, and that's saying something.
ビヨンセだったのか。やたらyoutubeのショート動画で使われてたから気になって飛んで来たよ。
Trash! Stay in your own lane is my opinion. Good artist in her genre and a brave effort here but why bother when you’re already made.
This song is ass. I dont know why its so popular.
Basic song to hypnotise people from seeing the lies weaved in this world , it ain't Texas , sacrificing children for Satan going down down down to Hell.  Whore to the beast
What a stupid video..why not show her singing the song for godness sake
Blacks can’t do country music
Horrid
This aint fucking country
S H I R T
This song sucks and I came here to pray to god I never hear it again on TikTok.
She’s just putting the same video on repeat while singing the same Lyrics over and over again
I want to hear Beyonce sing Gary Stewart Single again !!!
Now Jesus shes onto something thats hasnt been done in decades .... again.
Yesss queen
This is the most annoying song of all time
So it's okay when they culturally appropriate?
The whole video was her doing the same thing. Probably cost $9 to film.
song is nice but she should had did a better video then this smh
Song is good. Video is shit ❤
I see she went all out for the video 🙄 don't skint yourself now.
the new Jerusalema :))
I hate to say this, but the Beyoncé was a very beautiful woman and respectable. Everybody wants to see as much cleavage or nudity, but man it’s like a sellout like you have to do something that’s near pornography, or being a whore and it’s not about being a Karen is the fact that man people have to sell the body out in order to get so much publicity or fame, and that’s the way the world works.
dumb song - lousy lyrics - no thanks , I gave it a whirl. It stinks.
wow - no wonder I never liked her -- awful.
🙄
My teacher played this in school and it had a swear word in it 😂😂😂
What the heck is with being half naked?!? 🙄
I don't understand this video!! Country singers wear plead shirt and Jean! This is stupid!
I actually really love this
not even country.  More of that Pop, Rap wanabe stufff.
The most generic song. Why are you exposing yourself??  You arent the first black country artist.
Is this music video broken 😢
Illuminati conspiricy theorists having a feild day with the one eye covered lol
Sorry but this is absolute poser trash! She isn't country and this isn't country music WTF! So fake that it's laughable! 😂 Also the video is the same thing over and over.
i love this songggggggggggg
Is it inappropriate?    Yes🫢
this ain’t Texas but it also ain’t country music.l.
She trusts that jacket more than I have had in my life.
This is straight cancer!!  Bye B, try again 😂
Song sucks. Stick to what you are good at Bey.
Definitely a song i would play while travelling
This is the worst country sound ever
Video sucks
A música é boa mas esse clip deixa muito a desejar.Eu esperava mais
She is far from a country singer , girl sit down and stay in lane
This song is getting so much hate but I liked it
This is music? 💩💩💩💩
FREE FRANKLIN
Rainha
Totalmente sem noção esse clipe nada ver com nada decepção
I like the song, but the video is pointless.
Girl you play too much. But yes mam I like it. 😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Disgusting. Her husband has reached so many lows, including parading his daughter around with cleavage!
Mam your jacket fell off.   Her:😅  Them: 🤨💀
This isn’t Beyoncé, it’s an AI video. That’s why the title includes the word “visualizer.”
👎👎👎👎
It looks like someone trying to pimp her out!
♥️🫶🏽♥️🫶🏽♥️🫶🏽♥️🫶🏽♥️🫶🏽 🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵 🤠🔥🤠🔥🤠🔥🤠🔥🤠🔥 💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻
❤❤❤❤❤
Is she starting to go country? The song is different. The video is (I hate to say this...) it is boring. Showing the same thing over and over is not very entertaining or eye catching.
We need the bloopers…
No 😭
This is freaking terrible.
She keeps showing S*tanic signs... Three fingers down... three up + the one all-seeing eye.  WTF...
I like the song but I think the video could have been a lot better
😮
NOPE.
That’s weird, Best has no top on
Suppose making this video took looooot of time 😅
Awful. With all the shootings going on, WHY would she do something like this?
Awful. Severe disappointment 🤣
Bit confused on the clothes choice tbh  and found song boring
This is shit
This vidjo really blows  ({{{{  WOW  }}}})  song ain`t bad but ? 🤢🤮🤢😝😫😱😓😰😵☹️
That... was... a horrible... waste... of time... 👎🏽 Whomever(s) had the idea of making this kind of video needs to be fired; also, how is it necessary to almost show your nipples? I thought the video or my connection were having a problem, but no🥱 it was just the bad video; the songs is also really boring and repetitive, just like the video 😒
If the song wasn't trash enough, this video sucks balls.
Should have been sung by a Country Artist. She screwed this up!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why do we have to make trash out of everything!
I love this !!!!
I feel so 🤠
Decent song, worst music video I’ve ever seen.
Nasty 🤮 love the song but. WHO want to see all that cover up
Industry Plant .Said her videos have so much satanic undertones
Uhmm I was expecting a better video. Disappointed!
She is so ghetto. I get that she needs to take her clothes off to get attention if she isn't famous, but at this stage of her career, really? No wonder why Taylor got all the awards. At least she has talent and keeps her clothes on. Have some class
What a disappointment of a video. Good hook tho
What a disgrace. Her and her husband need to go back to where they came from in the music industry. She doesn’t belong in country. Thank god that they don’t play non of her crap on the country stations here
I just realized that Beyonce never won an album of the year and now she's trying out for "country".. That's just sad. .
Not impressed
The music ❤♥️💗🤩😍😍🤩 the music video🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀
She just keeps strokin' her boobs
I love your song
Great song - bad vid.
That is the worst song ever and music video
This is the Franklin the Turtle theme song. Wtf is she doing??
Unpopular opinion but I enjoy this song . country  or not
❤queen 🐝
Well this sucks
Why is this the theme song to Franklin
I expected more from this video. Love the song though.
What did i just watch...
this song sounds so lazy. lol. idk, it just sounds like she put no effort into this song. LOL. this is literally lazy country music. lol  LOL she is on th me billboards with this song? there are so many better songs than this!!!!!  Jay z and beyonce likely uses their power and money to get this to number 1. LOL this is hilarious and disrespects the country genre.  This is such a lazy country song. haha
That is definitely AI movement because... titties would be tittying if it was real movement
Lovely❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Franklin the Turtle brought me here.
Damn
Gonna lie this is 🔥🔥🔥
Una canción espectacular, maravillosa. Un vídeo totalmente decepcionante y absurdo. Sin sentido
I don’t like nothing I’m hearing or seeing. Sorry just my humble opinion.
Gross .too much cussing and not enough clothes on
Não sou fã da Beyoncé, mas estou surpreso por ter composto uma música country, apesar de suas músicas são do gênero Hip Hop
I love the song, so I looked up the video. I’m shocked.
Fucking awful song
Sorry honey, stick to what you know...and are good at. Not country
Q mojón de video
I'm not really a fan of Beyonce but honestly this song sounds like it was written by AI.   I kept waiting for the line about a pick up truck breaking down and the dog running away.
Maybe its me but she is not a good country singer. Desperate  for attention in that outfit
What a load of s**t 😂
Why is she dressed like that though?
This doesn't sound like country at all, and the ones that say it is just haven't been around country enough. Sounds like a Karen singing alternative music
I don't like the video 😑 bat I like the song 🙂❤
Quelle manie de se mettre quasiment a poil pour une chanson 🤦🏻...
Video sucks. She could of been more playful with this song
This dress is more exotic than a pornostar 😂😂. Music is fire.
😂😂😂😂😂
I am a big fan of her but can't stand this song and absolutely hate the video. The same thing over and over again....makes me anxious. Please go back to old school ways.
Uma grande Gostosa ❤
Trash🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Mi mente cuando escucha la canción: 🤠🌾🏡🏜️🛤️🚞 El video:
Mi mente cuando escucha la canción: 🤠🌾🏡🏜️🛤️🚞 El video:
Che topa
Shes never made country music before, and now she still hasnt 😂😂😂
It's the same thing but I love you
Bro this is as country as a well dressed politician in DC 😂
The songs good but what's the video???🤔never thought country was going porn makes her look really bad😮
The song is atrocious. She look good tho lol
Wow😂 She really got the racist white people mad in the  comments
So much hate for some reason by ppl who DONT EVEN LISTEN to Beyoncé anyway lol. The songs catchy but the video is just teaser porn. Do better Beyoncé! Ppl just can’t handle black artists doing country better than middle age white dudes. This is Old Town road all over again as far as the hate goes. Don’t worry old white ppl. You still got folk music. Nobody is coming for that shit! It’s all yours!
This show cases her talent as a singer although the curse words do not belong in country music.
Is that it just her walking forward and then again and again what a shit video
Thrash 🤢🤮
This song sucks and the fact that you call this country music
Franklin Theme Song?
What are you communicating Beyon? Their  other Platforms for this type of content or sensual expression.
Go get em Bey ! You can do whatever you want make your own mold 😊🎉😂
Worst song ever by her and video
Hey , it’s Franklin
Can none country singers leave country alone.  This is not country at all! Stick to pop beyonce.  Also the most cringey stupid video clip I've ever seen.  I don't know any country person that would wear that. Sex sells ahah really playing on that!
🚮
Garbage 🗑️
What the hell did I just hear? That is horrible what and insult to country music. Wow
Just because you say a couple country words doesn’t make it a country song 🤮
This song is awful.  The only thing she knows about a Hoedown is when a prostitute in NYC gets taken down.
Cute, fun and forgettable. Awful visualiser
I imagined the video for this song with a super moving choreography and what a 😢 but I still love her and her voice.  I love her
What does her dressing half naked have anything to do to with this song
I feel like the video was produced to get men to watch it in the hopes we will get to see her boobs. Somewhat exploitative IMO.
It's Franklin!!
hank and waylon would be disappointed
This video sucks
Free palestine 👊🇵🇸🇵🇸
Song's ok. She's definitely talented.  She ruined anyone taking her seriously, dressing like cheap trash.
I'm not a country music fan, but damn B you did your thang ❤
O vídeo mais barato da Beyoncé. 😄
え！この曲好き！
So uma mulher e uma jaqueta, não precisa de nada mais pra dona da porra toda amo ❤
She has a beautiful voice, it’s a shame she feels she isn’t good enough to do it with clothes on. 😢
This is supposed to be a hit lol 😅
We gonna see her get age restricted today 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Poor of Clothes
This is the best
She needs to cover up!!!!
Bruh, she sneeze on this track and be like “y’all keep that just mix it down”   Horrible song 🤣
how did this beat so many good songs for #1 on hot100
WORST MUSIC VIDEO EVER SONG IS GOOD MUSIC VIDEO NAHHHHH ITS JUST REPEATING AGAIN AND AGAIN😅
ordinary fashion in texas
This would have to be the biggest seeking for attention if I've ever known one. Come look at me I'm country now. What a crock of crap..
Boring! I love Beyoncé… this ain’t it tho…
Shitty song😂😂😂
Juju and tracee and nia for bets...let mazza know to let them know we ready 💋 😘 peace ..espn bets
"Hope you don't mind my panderin'
The Mexican OT putting Texas back on the map. Beyoncé can step down 😂
She really said the "ol dive bar" lmfao
Nothing says country like parking your lexus .  Lol
Why did This song blow up?
This is a terrible video. I'm disappointed in Beyonce.😢
BORING
You just made me like country a little bit.   Read 1 Cor 6.  What you are can become what you were.  Repent and Jesus can heal it all.  Make your bullshyt....your WAS shyt...but your IS, to become, is who God says that you should be.  God loves you and He knows who you ARE.  Blessings.
Lame?
I finally made it to the end of the song and it stinks. It is so nasty and lame. Bee sold herself short on this one. She is the fallen Queen. She isn't even a princess. She made herself a ho ho ho ho
I just cannot listen to the whole song. I hate that she looks like a cheap street walker.
Likeeee ❤
Wow, when you are worth a billion but you still feel you have to get nearly naked for attention. Has taylor shown her boobs and degraded herself.
What happens to the clothes some one need to donate her a dress to cover her body😢the body reveal is unnecessary with such a good voices. Very sexualizeeed
I love the song, but if I were your children I would be so embarrassed of my mom😥
Pakai la baju betol2
What is she wearing?
She singing country now,  there's already a dance out
“Country”
🔴❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧
why is she half naked
Country song it's not my cup of tea until Beyonce singing it .
Like the song but sorry the video does nothing for me
Beyonce is desperate for attention
The famous ONE EYE CLUB 🤮🤮🤮
Seems like you can’t beat Taylor, go country and have you tits out nearly
What happened to being classy
Narcissist as hell
This is not country music
This a R&B song with a country beat 🤣
Am I the only one who thinks most of these songs are being written by AI? 😂
This is Texas! We do holdem down
Ignorant song
never again please
💯💯💯💯🦋🦋🦋🦋
I strongly hate people that say this is country music btw
Love the song. Video sucked!!
Terrible and not country music. Dressed trashy and imo mocking country music
You're  so lax you're going to just cycle a small clip over and over as your video. YIKES
🤢🤡
OH ..GOD ..  TINA 💜TURNER...Would explose this song.  😮😭😭😭LADY , It be perfect to you..  You die too early . RIP 🌷 🌹 ⚘️ 🌻 🥀 🌷 🌹 ⚘️ . BEYONCÉ🩵 IS " not bad in this vidéo 🤪 👍👏.
يع قرف التعري🤢🤮
Beyoncé is very talented but I can’t say I’m a huge fan I don’t like country music but this song is pretty fire. I like her better as a country singer.
March 9 2024 I love this song
you're smooth like tennesse  whiskey  😀
This is country?
At last - Beyonce doing what comes naturally. Proving ebony and ivory are merely shades of the same cloth.
This isn't country
So did someone get paid to choreogragh this mess? I was hoping she actually danced.  Could have had a cute dance to go along with it...
Poker guys is pacience ! GL
Sounds like https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=K9f4Qxriug6AGLrQ
This to me is just a pop song with her singing about Texas I don't get the appeal.
Lyrics...This ain't country..ain't no hold em"
It ain't no good...give it up...not even close to country... stick to pop music...👎
Hey Beyoncé! Stay the Fu** out of country music!
Wtf  is this
Your body needs clothes
I cant stand looking at her. Its like she is making fun of us.
What is she actually doing?! Phone it in huh?
The song is meh. The video is terrible. But that outfit is smoking at least.
That outfit Is not giving country
I wanted how many walks it took for her nipples not to show
Bro, as soon as I clicked on this and I saw her like this, I said to myself this is not country at all. No no no no no no no no no start. Forgiving your sins because this is unacceptable.
Your disgusting
Ive notice that a lot of the ppl that hate the song have at least one thing in common !!! 😂😅
Trash !
So vim por causa do meme 😂😂😂😂
Everyone should remember Alan Jackson walking out on the CMA's because she performed with the dixie chicks. THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC! Or what it represents. Beyounce has been trying to break into the country world for a long time. SHE'S NOT COUNTRY! Shame on country music! And so called country music stations for playing it.  Stay tuned. I heard that Madonna's coming out with a country song too.
Is there an actual need or reason to dress like this for a "country song"?! Anybody realize how this is a literal rip off of the Franklin Turtle theme song from the cartoon?! It's not even original...jeezus....🙄🙄
This is the worst video and song that she has ever come out with
Disgusting!! It's sad the kid's will think her act is appropriate. Too bad she can't show some class
I think the haters are outnumbered and that makes me smile.
It’s just not country. It’s a normal Beyoncé song with an acoustic guitar. It’s kinda like daddy lessons.
This is wot kids see....wear some clothes. Just gross Film clip ruins a good song
Go George Strait
🔥 ❤ Love this! She pulled this off beautifully!!
Go Queen B i know the haters dont bother you ❤🎉
🇧🇷❤⚕📿⭐
0:08
I've never heard the word bitch in a country song before her.. I don't like it. 2 thumbs down to her country/rap music
Stick to your genre. Country ain't it. 👎
This music is terrible and the video is a joke right!? Cuz she changed her clothes or lack there of throughout  whole video? 😳 Sure as hell ain't country.
This is not a country song. And it sucks
Bruh this ain’t country

STOP RECOMMENDING ME THIS SHIT EVERY TIME I OPEN THIS APP
5 years late
Dumb
I like the song but dang she put hoe in a new light
Don't be a bitch now take it to the floor now..😂
Just hear to downvote. Not even going to listen to it. She doesnt belong in the category 😂
Absolute garbage lmao
This is a slave song smh
Phew
I love the song but noooooo to the music video
Is this the actual video?
Queen B brought competition straight to Taylor swift's bedroom 😅
Not country and is trash
The song is not that good to me But of course it's Beyonce so  a lot of people will fall  in line and act like it's great  .
When a heard this song...did not know who it was..catchy tune.😊
Calling this country is hilarious. Another great Pop hit from Bey.
Love the song..feck and ....god knows what that video is about...
Stop this fake counrty🤨🤨🤨🤨
Does anybody else hear the intro to Fred Penner‘s place? My wife says everyone is comparing it to the Franklin cartoon.  Pretty sure the folks who made that cartoon were Fred Penner fans.
"Heyy its Franklin! Coming to my house! Heyy its Franklin! Coming to your house!" 🎉🎉
Could never compare with nice music song like Loretta Lynn
Bro all I see is her walking and shooting her fingers
I didnt know beyonce did country music
I hate this song so much😒
WE SACRIFICING TO THE ILLUMINATI WITH THIS ONE  !  🗣️🗣️🗣️ 👁️🔺
I think Beyoncé was missing her calling all these years. I love her Country
Now everyone on YouTube shorts uses this sound
Why not just be naked
Great song but why the porn video?. Just was not necessary.
This is me an my sisters  the Carter Girl's an they don't no its the best life ❤love the damn song Getty up sister..
Is it just me or are main stream music videos getting lazier and lazier every year?
One of the worst songs I've heard in my life. And everyone uses this audio so i just have to suffer 😂
Ik this is weird but im from texsas and people who are not from Texas are doing the dance that I don't see what's the point of it
I heard along the grapevines beyonce said "aboriginal woman are the ugliest woman shes ever seen"  Really hope it aint true or we got reef & beef 💯 😂❤  I been loyal to your ass for years because you create masterpieces & spit truth 🌎🌎  I loved the concert i went to of yours too!! Xoxo
The worst shit I've heard in awhile 🤣🤣💀💀
She should not be able to dress like this and just this for a video this should be banned
What the fuck is this 😢😂
I watched approximately 1 min trash . Not country .
...means that, Beyonce was always giving Jay-Z the cowgirl poz.... 😂😂😂 If you love Beyonce, put a like here ❤❤
Disgusting.. obejctification of a woman dressed like a harlot. On top of that she is a family woman with a husband and CHILDREN.. the devil has got entertainment in the palm of his hand.. there is NOTHING FREE or UPLIFTING about a woman having to dress in such a way just to get attention.. but the establishment wants you to believe that a woman COVERING up is OPPRESSED whereas the opposite is FREEDOM... 😂😂😂
Riding on Dolly’s coattails
Did Nvidia get a share for the physics of the "pair"?
Meemaw would’ve loved this song
La musique je l'aime bien, mais le clips franchement...
Pixar's Klux
Stole this song from Franklin the turtle 🤦🏼
Is that all B’s gonna do   ❤😂❤😂 ❤
what was the song' orijinal version? I can't remember.. Adele?
Heeeey it's Franklin... coming to your house
It's bad....
Great song. Stupid video.
Weird video, clearly illuminati
here ya go better than this song.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liOfyvWReJ0
For years and years I've been asking myself: Why do women have to be naked all the time when they're selling their song?
Whos think taylor is better?
I havent been a Beyonce fan in like 10 years. But I thought the song was cute, but this is literally the absolute worst music video I have ever seen in my life...
This song is trash ots just her shooting and showing her 🍒
Good song ; terrible video!
Beyonce has ate this up and she really did good I'll give this a 9/10 🔥
This made it to my Texas Roadhouse 💀
I hate it
AMAZING SONG
Hi
But why is she dressed like that, TRYING to sing country?
This ain't Texas toast from dollar tree is it
Too photographic video image!! 😱😇
Free phalestine
She’s finally lost the plot.
Beyonce music trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
I do enjoy the song but this video of her while wear anything at all and to think young girls gotta look at this. I think this is OK.
💩💩💩
Why you trying to sound like Rising Appalachia?
No can’t stand this dose not suit her atall 👎
😂
😅😅🤭rsrsrsrsrs😊
You can't afford a shirt
Honey Bey Queen of Texas Hold Em
This is wack . 😒  i expected color and w.e goes with ho downs lol
Was that it, WTF
🔥🔥🔥
I love the song but I wish she would have had on a cowboy outfit on instead but I love the song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's a good song
This is trash..
what the HELL!!!  yea sorry stick to what you know.
Worst song ever
Ok that outfit is just unexeptable
Good song.  The video could've been sooo much better.
Dang, I didn’t know this song was made 3 weeks ago.
One eye covered... illuminati controls her .
Beyoncé I’m your biggest fan I love you girl this is your best song but I know you can do better keep following your dreams
Wow are you kidding me this is no good the performance is so repeated and i how did this end up number one it's ok thats all .
This song is fire baby...💥 heeeeeeeeeh-haaaaaaaaah🤠
Omggg her shirt!😮
Sorry old dumbasses in the comments, you don’t get to gatekeep a genre. Especially one THAT WAS STOLEN BY YOU GUYS.
Instant banger
Sorry this absolutely not country music.
She’s so pretty omg 😘
Eu amei essa música.
meh definitely not her lane stick to pop   and  16 carriages  aint it neither  no good hook or anything wtf I thought this was Beyoncé 👎 weak try again
Franklin did it first.💯
boring generic music.
I like the song but she is just nasty.
Queen Beyonce ❤❤❤❤❤
WHAT ON EARTH .  WHO  ARE YOU TRYING  TO IMPRESS.   . LOWCLASS.  YOUR   DOGGY  HUSBAND  WITH  STILL   CHEAT ON YOU ...
I like the song the video seems kinda pants for her to be fair
If her body really looks like that after kids...got to give her a hell yeah...not a fan..but yeah..she still looking great.
Award for most boring video🎉
Maraaaaaaa66/C3 please!
Eww
Disgusting
Doesn't sound country.  More like Pop. And the outfit is to much like a stripper. It makes sense as to why country music isn't happy about her to join them. This isn't country it's pop music.
This video makes no sense
I'm trying to keep it respectful, but look at the singer. No respect, not country. Trickery to Satan's layer. Goodness, GOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ROOT OF MUSIC, COUNTY KEPT IT REAL. WHAT'S HAPPENING?!!! Don't accept this. Just keep living, it'll go away. ( I like some of her own genre music) Not country, just propaganda.
I hate this song leave the Blackity black slang out of country music I don’t even know how to spell witch you this is not country and the word floor is now flo get this shit out of here there’s some slang for you it has nothing to do with Beyoncé it has everything to do with blackity black slang in country music
Worst song of the year.
Are we sure this is country?😮
AI generated😮
My mom is madly obsessed with this song
"Hey its Franklin" 🎶 😂
Is this someone’s Only Fans account? LOL
You have got to be kidding me 😂
They really had to do the same video over and over again
Bro this is MORE country than most country songs right now what are you even mad about
Get dressed, no one dresses like that in Texas or any Texas 😂
Waw this song is amazing 🎉🎉❤❤
Not country
Que feo video
She doesn’t have to dress like this to sale music. Her singing talent alone would have sold millions. Why does she have to be half naked to advertise her first country song?
Stay in your own lane and stay out of country
Not me thinking this was a music video 😂😅
Wierd music vid bc ahe is doing the same things over and over but other than that this is a banger ❤❤
Fake country
You just made George Strait throw up in his mouth that was disgusting.
Great song trashy look I can’t believe to dress like that that is so under class
FINALLY COUNTRY!!!!❤
She could've put some actual Effort into this
I like it
I wish I liked Beyonce's voice more but I don't like the breathy part of her voice. She's a good dancer though .. the only Beyonce song that I can listen to is "get in formation" .. but the rest of her songs her voice kinda falls breathy and flat
This is wanna be country
Song is trash “respectfully”
That's not appreciate
Love it as much as I didn't want to lol 😂😂😂
Rubbish 🗑
💀💀💀🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a pity Beyoncé now feels the need to ruin and absolutely fabulous song by dressing in such a demeaning and disgusting way.  Is she so insecure about her product she feels the need to sell her body for views?  She has gone from an icon to a cheap joke.  Sorry but video clips like these are adding to the demoralisation of our society.  Her attire is not representative of what the country scene and country people are about and she should feel ashamed trying to represent it.
An interesting breakdown of the song. A singing masterclass.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=803CiBtaqJA&t=2s
It looks like Beyonce didn't have time so they filmed her once and than duplicate.
Òmĝ ìĺòvè þĥè þĥìß ßòñĝ
Everytime I hear this song, my day gets a little worse…
I like salami
Worst song you've made 😂😂😂   And why are you naked?   You can only sell music if you're naked?
Beyonce wonderful woman ❤ best song😊
Like the song but the video is boring no movements to the hoe down or nothing she should have had like cowgirls or something dances something its just her walking damn there soliciting herself like women of celebrity status or in General do for fame and fortune
Beyonce makes me like country music now ❤
Gorrrl
Rubbish
She has more trust in her Outfit than me in my hubby😮
How is this country ? Because it has a banjo ?
so generic and bad
This is NOT country music
Who's 60 years old after spending 30 years?😅
Big fan of Beyoncé. This does not sound like or vibe like true country music. This just sounds like she is mocking country music.
Damn Jay-Z is definitely the luckiest man because he can go to bed with this woman every night
This is first Beyonce song I am hearing
#overrated
My teacher is a boy and he loves this
This song is 🤮. And the video is absolute dog 💩💩
It's like Adele's :  song Send My Love (to your new lover)
They got their right for anything they wanna do, but they don’t have the right to call it country. Cause it’s not.  Ray Price

Dumbest video I've ever sad through for 10 seconds before closing out!!!
Nasty put some clothes on
Pensare che con il talento che ha non avrebbe bisogno di fare la zoccola nuda
Country singers dont get naked 😮
She looks AMAZING, BUT, how much do you want to bet that this is A.I.?!?😮😊😮 You NEVER KNOW😅😅😅
🤮
Song is trash af Jesus
The s8ng is fun but the video seems to be broken cause its playing the same image every few seconds
This song is just not very good
🔥🔥🔥🖤
Stay away from country, you just can't sing country.
😂
Beyonce voice fyn like guitar
Bro sorry but I hate the fit and the animation is horrible
Country vibe, terminator aesthetics... 🎉❤
I like the song. Won't download because I don't support her. Why tf is she dressed like that?
This is not country...and she's naked and wth did I just watch? This is so bad
What a stupid video
Catchy tune, I love it, truly, but you brought gangsta to country music.Just because you can doesn't mean you should darlin.
The clothes are disgusting
I swear, if I hear one more person say this is country music
I thought this is gonna be country genre music video, but it was just her top less
Daaamnnn this song 🥵🔥🔥🥵
THANKS.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Why you are naked!???  so sad
I don't know why everybody likes it. The whole thing is trash. I turned it off on me radio station because it's so bad. I rather listen to no music at all.
The so g sounds good.  Her outfit does not say county music.  She is naked so she gets lots of view.  Would she has gotten thus many views if she not naked.
This is soft porn
porn
Time Is of The Essence. Thank you!
The song I love, video is HORRIBLE!!!!!!
Fancy having that much influence and choosing to influence in this way 😢
Video I don't get, but the song got a mean vibe ❤
This song is as horrible as that augmentation.
So haram وهذا مخالف للإسلام
I came over to see what this country album was all about and what people were complaining about....damn,  complaining because of jealousy.  This is good stuff. ❤
:30 seconds in… what the hell?
😍😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍
This song is trash 🗑 😂
This was three weeks ago
If anyone's is that firm then they can were what they want
Video not very country also the  start of the tune sounds like Madonna don't tell me and she's last to do it Madonna 1st then kylie.i like Beyonce but not this sorry babe 🙈
What Country singer dress like this?
That's the best film clip she can come up with???
#Arkansas
I’m obsessed with song but don’t get video? Is it same thing over and over again?
Wtf is this bull💩
Welcome to America now.       Save your Country.
Love the song. Hate the video. The video served no purpose. We already know she is drop dead gorgeous.
Video 📌  nothing to do with the song. Doesn't match
I don’t really like this song
This is horrible wtf Beyoncé and Taylor Swift switch genres or what?
Totally prepared to support her venture into country, until i saw this.. uninspired trash.. this ain’t country honey!👎
This song sucks tbh
Love this song but this video is ridiculous.. all Beyonce does is this same thing with her fingers and blows it like a gun.. thought there would be more to her video then just this. 😮
Look respectfully
Sounds like the theme song from Franklin!
The song isn't too horrible but the gross outfit is just awful. Have you no respect for yourself and your body? Yes we have a right to dress the way we want, but it always says something about who we are inside when you can't respect yourself and put clothes on.
That aint country atire and country people dont drive a lexus 🤣🤣
Houston Tx !!!
This ain’t country
This is not country.
Leave country to the whites
Here is the link, to my new song you requested,   I can't believe you loved it, thank you so much.   https://youtu.be/xu0396r1ZMM?si=XtTXtojgQVG934i4
Garbage
wtf kinda video is this? a 7 second scene on repeat for 3.57 minutes.... cmonnnnnnnnnn
Stop telling this women yes she can do it all 😂
Is this all she doing in this. Video???? No line dance???? I like the song, but the video is lame! 😮😢
🎶 Hey! It's Franklin!! 🎶
We’re going to Texas
Just hopping on the band wagon much? ❤have your own style
This is about as country as caviar.  Toby is rolling in his grave right now.
Just remember solange in the elevator 😊😊
this is the best country song.
Is that it? That's the video? Is this a joke? ...
I aspire to have the same unwavering faith that they have in that jacket 😂
The tune kept me patting my foot. Not sure what genre should claim it, and I’m not certain it matters.  Beyoncé is a an established entertainer, I just wish she would not always feel the need to undress.
Came here specifically to hate 😤😡😤😡
How is this country again ?
We all know she looks amazing, and sings like an angel; but if she’s going to switch genres show me more than her standing in a frame.
Disgusting, really.
With a voice like hers, she doesn’t need to try so hard with the outfit, or lack thereof. Sad.
Most boring video ever
This shit was made for the mentally retarded
esbieja. La.  cancion😮
Whats up the 10 second loop?
The first is crazy 😅
Suck to r&b and hip pop…. This is trash.
It’s giving country-western Reputation but with half the clothing missing
She is literally naked.....
Good god this is AWFUL……
Now I need to see Ozzy do some hip-hop and rap.
Better not disrespect Beyoncé like this Helena 96 basically like hell 96 shut up and I’m only eight and I like Beyoncé me and my mom too. So shush.
“This isn’t Texas “nahh it’s flash town
Thanks Beyoncé I've been in a coma for the last 13 months and just a week ago this song played on the radio and i woke up just to turn this shit off
The song is amazing but her outfit 😅
If this isnt county i dont know what the fuck is
Every band has a country song. Led Zeppelin has a couple, Hot Dog or Bron Yr Stomp. Rolling Stones Sweet Virginia. Not performed by a “country artist/country music” band is what the radio station is saying to dismiss her country song.
I like it, sounds like Fleetwood Mac
Unreleased this
Senseless vid but a great song. Indeed.🤠
Sounds like a country song to me....I wonder if the radio station that refuses to play it saw the video first?
WE ARE A FAN!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Great track. Hope to hear it on Sirius XM Outlaw Country.
Yes she has a wonderful voice but please I wish artists would start wearing clothes. I don't need to see so much dam ridiculous
Please stop showing your cleavage. I’m here for real Texas! The world is!   Good song. But the lyrics is so anti Texas 🤦🏻‍♀️
Beyoncé is trusting that jacket with her life
Absolutely the dumbest music video I ever seen. Such talent LMAO
very good Song(≧∇≦)b✨
this is the music from the cartoon franklin
This must be where all the low income uneducated racist come to vent.😂
Disgusting how she is half naked... you know when music sucks by how underdressed the performer is...
❣️♥️❣️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏀
Completely fits in the same bubblegum country crap that come out of Nashville. It sucks just the same!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/6al6G2FEDHg?si=UfJ9bTUi7007BlQd
Is this shit supposed to be like country music or something?… what a shame.
CHRISTINA AGUILERA lo hizo en el 2012, de manera epica, y esta señora 14 años despues. Ya no  es importante.
We made the country music We Are The originators of country music so it is our right to sing country music,, We Are The originators of all music and Everything Else! Do Your Research 💯💯💯💯💯💯 SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE! BEYONCE!!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🎊🎊🎊🎊
Are watching the same clip over and over again what the heck
She's the new Country Cher for the LBGTABCDF community!  Hilarious!!!
Wtf is this shit
What kind of crap is this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vine por el reel, que decepción 😒
This is as bad as billy ray
Even Charlie Pride wouldn't consider this country music, and he would know!
Ghetto trash
I LEFT MY KEYS.
HEY..
Now Black people created country and Whites stole it? Really? Stop rewriting history and then call people who know the truth racists. I have listened to country for 50 years and have never heard the word bitch. And since this isn't country I still haven't!
Cant unhear the relation to the Franklin theme song now haha
The video clip for this one is just so lazy…
Her outfit…
She looks like an extra in the movie Hustlers. She should stick with what she is, and a country singer isn't it. If she ever steps foot on the Opry stage the building will burn down. Patsy and Tammy are turning over in their Graves.
This is terrible That's all I can say
I am Swiss and I think Europeans are not so obsessed with skincolor and stereotyped thinking. Here we have the concept, a artist is a artist and can do what ever his creativity and spirit shows him. Tina Turner once said: "I'm a black femal singer. In the USA they never allowed me to do rock music, just R'n'B.
Thiis is NOT country music! Just because Beyonce says it is a country song does make it so. Real country doesn't have Lexus cars, the word bitch and is on the verge of profane (she looks like a $2 hooker). I applaud the real country stations who refused to play this trash. A pig with lipstick is still porcine.
This is terrible!
A goddess ❤
I barried a child in a red cup. 1:43
Stick to hip hop and ur culture .
Ανατρίχιασα…👏👏♥️♥️
Beyonce switching up genres to capitalize on new markets thats all not some kind of social statement 😅. y’all forget who her husband is.  Its catchy though and her voice sounds so good and classic!!
i heard better country music...and why does she needs to be dressed like this...half naked?
I literally couldn't finish listening to this song. Beyonce it's surprising you even made it to the top if the Bill boards but we are talking about the Queen herself who has FANs that wouldn't know true talent if it bit them in the butt of anything you are just another Madonna a woman who dresses like a skank on stage so that her poor talent would be ignored for her body and that seems like a trend with Female Artist these days
Hey it Franklin
She definitely got work done cuz ain’t nooo way she had 3 kids and her boobs are still holding up nice lol
Suuuuuuuiuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks absolutely garbage 💯
Is this a video?  Ok if it is, then it sucks!  🤮🤮🤮
Bro the kids that are watching this to see stuff your gay
She should just stick with her R&b hip hop shyt leave xony music alone i mean she tried and thats what counts but no just no theres either R&B or theres country no in between no mixing be what you wanna be if you R&B be that to the fullest if you country be country to the fullest theres no rbuntry
Such a disgusting display. Nobody curses in country music. Nobody dresses like that in country music. She has to come and taint it up with her filth.
Who
Beyonce has never been Country and never will be.
A complete disgrace to country music all together. Put some cloths on while you at it. It's a crying shame how she and others teach our small children that it's OK to dress and act in this way.
Just as awful as all the rest of modern country music. This is pop music.
This is an insult to country music and the video....WTF.
WTF is country about this repetitive BULLSHIT
Oi gente desculpa aí se o professor ele deve ser burro cara porque 1 + 1 eu sei que é igual a 2 consigo igual a 2 então então vamos lá esse professor é burro como por exemplo que 1 + 1 = 2 então 2 + 2 é igual a 4 por que esse professor tá fazendo e a ousadia porque 2 + 2 igual a 4 não A5 então então ele vai fazer até estudar botar assim criança para ir se divertir 2 + 2 = 4
❤
I wish she had done a dance with her song. It's 🔥🔥🔥
This song is shit stop putting this everywhere
Never really ment it she's awesome I was trying to sound stupid like some of the worlds been acting to prove my point so thank you for your help❤
Wow I listen I don't know what to but I listen stay on your own side of the tracks if you gonna make some BS and call it country.
Absolutely mid. Sounds like  hokey commercial music and like it’s from 2013. The hey ho’s and whistling couldn’t sound more formulaic.
Sorry Bey not impressed.
Bey is a trendsetter I luv it❤
Cual es la idea de traer un ojo tapado? Cada día mostrando su verdadero rostro (illuminati)
Beyonce forever ❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂
This is absolutely abhorrent
The song: 🏡🥃🌾🤠🌅 The aesthetics: ⛓️🌃💄🕶️🎤🪩
always the Illuminati symboles in her songs
When you can’t beat Taylor Swift, you switch genres.
She is perfection what hasn’t she got.  She’s go the lot.  6 steps and the video is fabulous
This shit ain’t country
Omg she's appropriating white's wtf
Traaasssssssshhhhhh!!
This song is 🗑️
I like this song and I like you, my girl 😍
Why dit they make here do the same thing the hol time
Trash. She needs to stay in her lane.
It's awful! Beyonce,  go back to your genre. Don't mess up country.
She is hot 🥵🥵🥵
This is NOT country.
wtf 😂
Y eso es todo mostrar cómo dispara dónde lo que más critican es a la gente que sale disparando no entiendo porque la canta "ella," no es malo 🥱🤔🤔🤔🥺🥺🥺

For her being a role model maybe she cover her her boobs either that or do a naked video it’s ridiculous. Do you wanna be a role model start dressing accordingly
I have no idea who she is but it was good!
I really like this song Beyonce nice job and I am not a huge fan of country
Yawning. ~from a black woman.
This is a TUNE. I lived in Nacogdoches for 9 months while studying and I Iove that Texas vibe. Making me nostaaalgic❤💙🤍
¨̮
people say she not country if thats the case none of the ones singing country is country because  it dont sound like hank sr    i think she sounds great dont like it dont listen
Put some clothes on lol
Here boobs on the right sight ' on the ❤ are also more  then the other one" womans day ! 😊
Why is her skin white now?
This ain't country, this ain't even good... Just stick to what you're good at, country singing aint it boo boo
Dam she just can't put out anything decent after the stolen lemonade album... Smh just bow out with grace bby
The video though 😂😂😂😂
top
tremenda canción 🤠
It’s too bad a song just can’t be enjoyed by everyone without all the division.
Why is it a,lazy video production? You've made countless dance moves fir other songs
Between forgetting that Darrius Rucker exists and pretending that this is amazing, the comment section is trash.
Im back..i still do not like her outfit or the face garb but the more i listen to this song i  definitely like it more and more. And i must say never been into country western music. Just not my type of music ..but good music but this song has a sweet beat I LIKE IT  ....wish she would wear something less reveiling tho..lol
Stupid
I'm not a united States citizen but i remember to read and heard that texas is a State with conservative values. Don't understand why Bync made this kind of video... I would like to know what Texans citizen think about
This isn’t country 🤣🤣
I honestly dislike country music so much...but this song is 🔥🔥🔥.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just seen a tiktok vid of this guy claiming this song is dedicated to him and his wife
Πολύ όμορφη μουσική!
What's with the strange outfit? I am very curious to know how she will like on the back of a horse.
She's just doing what Queen Legend Aretha always has done ,.Queen Aretha encouraged Female Artist like Beyounce who want to be a force in this industry ,She said be consistent and research and own your craft ,and explore your horizons in music ,be the best that you can be in different aspects of music .( That creates Longevity and doesn't put you in a one dimensional category .
I like the song, but she is so vulgar in this video
I was today years old when I realised Beyoncé was black….. not me thinking she was white! Ima be colour blind 😅😅
This is actually one of the worst songs to he released in the past two years. Yikes.
I like the song, I hate the porn video!  LOL!  Why?!?!?
She should have just kept this
when I say I hate country music never EVER am I talking about this.
Trash song
Ruining Country I wouldn't let my kids watch that! Why does she have to be naked Shameful 😢
I like it!  .... Tonja Maria
who will listen to this song in 2030? Rise your hand please✋
How embarrassing to country music.
Making me wish I was deaf
This slaps so hard
Kanye must be her new stylist because this outfit is giving Bianca Censori to me
Trash
trash
Hun you beautiful, I just don't believe your proper country
Ayeee
Love it
She Don't know nothing about what's she singing
The black singers can’t make it in rap so they have to dress like strippers and sing what they think is country.  Go learn an instrument come out with a fiddle  a guitar get a real band and put some damn clothes on and have fun. ….
Love the comments bashing Beyoncé. Nature is calling. I hate her
Her left eye…..
Why you got to be half naked for this song WTFH IS WRONG WITH YOU
As a completely straight, married woman with children...... I CANNOT keep my eyes off her (.)(.)😂
HAOOOOO YO Crazy Rabbit conejo 🐰 🐇🐇🐇🐇🐇😂😂😂😂😂😂
Was ist das für ein blödes Video??
Uyyyyy my 🐇🐰🐇🐇🐇🐇🐇😂😂😂😂
Slay pookie
Weird, least country and most boring video
I loved the sound
Sounds like a wifi advert..
She said " this aimt Texas' ..........exactly....... and tĥis ain't country
Go lady B. I love it!!! NC born and we listened to everything!  lol my parents watch hee hah. lol
This is trash. Music is meant to inspire, this does nothing to help humanity
I DON'T LIKE THAT SHE GETS SO NUDITY. SHE'S TOO A-OLD FOR THAT.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
BEYONCÉ I LOVE YOU AND YOUR MUSIC SO MUCH I CHOSE YOU FOR MY BLACK HISTORY PROJECT AT SCHOOL I LOVW YOUUUUUUUU❤
Celebrities would've never dress like this in 2009...
This ain't country this is Garbage
Hi Beyoncé I pray 🙏 for you...your future is safe in The Most High....❤
This song does not go with Beyoncé! You can’t fit in where you don’t belong I learned that years ago!
Thumbs down 👎
Where's the country and the video has nothing to do with country
She literally stole this beat from Franklin the Turtles theme song 🤣
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Imagine having as much money as beyonce. And then having the talent to make this the best song she's ever made. And still she has to resort to dressing in a most disgusting manor. Why?
❤❤❤ 👌🏽
She needs to stick with the bullshit she knows cause if you think thats country your dumb as that song
This ain't country.  Cuz I don't like country.  But I can't say I hate this like I do country.  This might be worst
Why the need of nudity and sexuality? She thinks her music isn't good enough? Bc for me this is overcompensation....
Too sexy 😍
My idol😍
This song is so bad i know you mfers arent serious...
As a lifelong fan of country music, this just doesn't feel country to me.
Bro what tf is this shit
Nothing is more soothing than country music.
When she start singing country
This is the worst video
😢 this us ni where near country nor should be class as so. So more like bad rap
Just because you CAN, doesn't mean you SHOULD, Mrs Carter.  Put some bloody clothes on, FGS!  What is that about? I've always been a huge fan of Beyonce, but the Carter antics are getting a little tiring...  Seriously odd MV.
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!
As a texan this is offensive and appalling
This ain’t no mf country this some goofy ass shit
Plays Red dead redemption once and doesn’t know how to act.
Bull Sh#t
omg... nope.
Everyone listen to this who's not from Texas 😌😌😌😌  Evey Texan listening to this: 🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺
Keep "illuminating" for them you overrated hack
Country is black now?  What’s with the claims  Just enjoy it
❤❤❤
Totally awful. And that outfit is unbecoming. These grown women with kids need to take a step back and see how ridiculous they look. No matter what tricks she pulls, she’s still mediocre and aging out of the fresh newbie phase. She should spend less time on bleaching and dressing like a street walker and more time or doing something constructive. Also, she’s not “reclaiming” anything, know your history, it’s not Country, it’s Blues and Jazz and no matter how upset that mother of hers got  because Jennifer Hudson won the award and accolades, news flash, bleach and hooker clothing does not give you talent. Whitney had the talent to turn a Dolly Parton song into a classic, this mess fails miserably in comparison.
This is garbage and not country music at all.
I’m not crazy about the video but I love this song. Did you hear me high love this song I better go to bed I gotta get up in three hours. Thank you Beyoncé.
I love you Beyonce thank you for all good music from you my queen
Good song, stupid video
It's easy to corrupt people through music.
Before this song.... there was this song. Paid tribute to  Shania and others. Just saying 4 years ago BTW and has more lyrical content  and even line dancing too  https://youtu.be/8nBFqZppIF0?si=bxFF23YSiWwVmpfk
yee ha
Boring video! Expected better.
AI video?
Is this the real video?
Furthest thing from a country song ive ever heard
GARBAGE
This is the closest we’re getting to a music video so y’all better enjoy it
How disappointing. Thought that song sounds interesting can’t wait to see the clip bet Beyoncé got full creative lol
Meh.
Does she have to show so much skin to feel good? She is over rated.
Boufonne...
I love you Beyonce Go get em country style you go girl 🥰🥰🥰
This some bullshit she ain’t county she from the hood
What a stupid video!
What a fuc.... joke!
It's catchy fuck it's as good as any of this other bullshit out there people call country 🤷‍♂️
Video ruins the song
This is not country and she is not country put on some clothes
Not country. Just Beyoncé singing another song. Love her, but this is not country at all.
I love Texas.  No more California
This is Hard no! I’m her fan but not for this
Where's Timberlake at?
I like Beyonce, but this ain't it!
I love Beyonce but that's not country
This is not a country song country music is Chris Stapleton, Ryan Bingham, Tyler Childers, Zach Bryan, Jordan Davis and many more but this ain’t country at all
This is trash
Completely awful
It's great, we all knew that she had the talent. Now she's gotten  ahold of some excellent material.
I absolutely love Beyonce this is such a great song I love dancing too . Your beautiful Beyonce love ya
If anyone can do it Beyonce can.
Yuck
Please stop dressing like  that
This has reeeeeeealllyyyyyyyy grew on me.🐝🤠⭐️🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
This song is horrible! Only reason she came out with this song, was due to Oliver Anthony & Tom MacDonald taking over the charts. Yea yea, Go ahead and say you don't know them men. Just shows how much you don't know. She's the biggest puppet in the industry. Enjoy y'alls trash!
The video sucks! Its her walking up and faking shooting a gun. Wtf
That outfit looks so uncomfortable
Ummm honey, your stockings are on backwards, that seam line is meant to go on the back...
Slayyyyyyy
Ok this is stupid what is she trying to prove that she can walk and pretend to shoot her fingers . Come on.
This is from "here comes Franklin" tf
Iloveian
Song is surprisingly good. The video is crap.
It's not Country, it's Bluegrass.  I can almost hear someone on the washboard.  Perhaps the end time has come after all?
omg I love you im soooooo happy  u made country music <3<3
I don’t like this song but I cant put my finger on why I don’t
This ain't Destiny Child either...God gave a talent...use it unto His word
This is the dumbest fucken song i ever heard.  What a 🤡
This is a rip off of an Adel song
I like this song but this video is boring as hell!
Love the song but video sucks
Trash
Ain’t real country
I'm nervous  I'm really nervous, it's an honor to be here 😀
I have to admit it's catchy  I'm not a Beyonce fan, nice to look at, but musically not my type. But I like this.  #Dollywillalwaysbequeen
Not country
Say what? No thanks.  Plus,  using the B word? This isn't country.
Sorry but people are homeless and dont have food and then Ur just wasting that
I liked the song. It’s catchy but the bullshit she is wearing half naked is ridiculous.  Damn girl put some clothes on smh.
You're not Taylor Swift.. Give it up...
https://youtu.be/EQfm-Qqy-wU?si=MUcTPqBs-VlV_ib1  This is REAL country
What the fuck is she pulling her 2 fingers out and you can see fiear coming from her fingers so angie what the fuck is shite
I just don’t like the outfit
Fake country team 👇        (I’m sorry if I offend you im just from the south so I was grown up on Hank Williams jr and Alabama and old country)
The video is so bad
I love it
She should go ahead and take off the top.... Stupid video....
This isn't even remotely country
I dont care wether its pop, country or whatever..... ITS A TUNE 🎉🎉 it makes me happy, just chill and enjoy
This ain't country. Put some clothes on!
You can almost see her country😂
I want to like it. The beat and everything but I can't. Something is wrong in this for me. Sounds like Disney made this song.
🤢🤮 cant stand this song!!!!
but why is she half naked???  if your confident n know you have a good voice n song then why???
Wow I like this country soul..... SOUNDS DAMN GOOD!!!!
No!!!
This sucks
OK  I've always loved Country music and I think she's really good.  Here's my problem.  Country Western singers always have a wholesome look and if  anything sexy it's usually in good taste and cute.  Beyonce now is coming in singing dressed like hip hop  as if wanting to change the country look. I believe we like our country western singers lookin like country.  Real American lookin country folks.  We have enough of that l Grammy dress. Like I said, her music is fabulous, but to me I hate the look. I wish her all the best but hope she changes to look like a Country singer and dress the other way with her other music.
<3
What an embarrassment to country music. If you like this song you probably don't know what gender you are either lol
What’s with the g string and boos? I love your music but why do you need that look? Is it a comment on Ai?
Beyonce continues to exploit the work of others without giving the original artist credit
Trash
NOT COUNTRY MUSIC !!
This is not country
Jeeeeez  she didnt even need to wear the cowboy hat or do the line dance moves...
This is garbage. Ain’t an ounce of country in this noise
Really like the song. Don't think it needs to be played on country radio. But for Beyonce I really like it. It sounds more pop like her old stuff.
Just so everyone knows   Historians agree that black American culture is based of southern white culture….. sorry to break it to you
Not bad… R&B melded with pop country quite nicely.
Love the song… not so much the video!!! Nothing country about that!! Unrelateable to to the theme of the song!!
BeyHive! Beyonce has surpassed 70 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time! 🐝👑
This is the only song of hers I like and good god I thing she needs to make more like this
This isnt country this is trash and doesnt deserve to be consider as country so as a country music listener i would take this off.
I’ll listen to anything she sings, but I must say this is a breath of fresh air!.
Overrated tbh
She is putting ALL of her trust in that shirt🤤
Y’all think she follows god? Absolutely not.
This isn’t country 😭
The best song ever Beyoncé did she’s so cool
Absolutely zero respect for Beyoncé
This is Pop for those who think this is country. Clearly Country died in the early 2000's if this is passing as it. To be honest most main stream "Country" singers these days aren't really country either. I came to watch this out of curiosity and was not let down by the sheer stupidity of people thinking this is country. Alan Jackson was right in 2016.
This is so corny. It irritates my soul. BTW-- I'm not a country music fan. I don't care who's singing it.
Great song, terrible video.
WTF
😵‍💫🥹
🗑️🚮🗑️🚮🗑️
Slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Beyoncé’s not Beyoncé no more🥲😶
If em is a culture vulture what does this make her? There nothing whiter then country music. Lmao jk I love country but this isnt it
At 1:16 the near,y her hole breast is showing ………
This is actual garbage.
No, it’s crap.
I am from Texas
Lil mo pressure remix beyonce youtube
Go away and quit trying to slut up country music!  What a stupid video.  What a terrible example for young girls.  Anyone who disagrees with me is part of the problem with our society now.
Terrible song
You stole this from Franklin. Leave our childhoods alone
This ain't country
I love the song and the video I just don’t like the outfit with the vest it’s to revealing
I guess she thinks she has to be half naked for people to like her songs 🙄
What the heck is this??? Country has absolutely lost it's mess. Lord help us. This ain't country and I don't give a 💩 who likes it! Omg
She’s such a poser .  She ain’t county.  She’s making a mockery of it.
So the video is of her doing the same thing.... lmmmmeeee
Where it the video for this song? Is she coming out w a whole EP of this album???
Love the song, hate the video
Black music genres? Said by those who claim oppression , racism, etc.. are failing to realize they categorize things as such themselves..
It’s just the same thing over and over again lol
Hate this so much lol it’s not country it’s a sad attempt during a random glitch in her career can’t stand this sound with her voice don’t hit right at all
I could most definitely see somebody with a bit of larger girth, perhaps a very large man with large boobs and a belly, and a Mini or less, ick, performance on SNL. Great parody. I’m gonna have to forward that to them.❤😂🎉
Why is this just her repeating doing the same thing over and over. This must have took a lot of thought 🤣
Don't like her wigs, song is brilliant.
This isn't country.
finally listening!!!
This aint country at all sorry
Sounds like the Franklin theme song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqyE-lWqCE&t=3s
is this how to scam on yt lol? the blur around his face filter lmao?
“Heeeey it’s Franklin” > Beyonce
"Headed to the dive bar" sure bitch. Sure.
There is the dance.There is no dance she cannot dance
I love this song SOOOOO much!!! Puts me in a great mood!!!❤
😂this song SUCKS. I like Beyonce. Well used too. Seems like last decade or 2 she has started to suck though. Put a ring on it and since then she sucks. Whoever she has writing her music since that song, sucks and she needs to fire them.
Okay that’s a bit revealing 💀
Shw could poot on a beat and yall would buy it...
This is not the Texas anthem. So if anyone says that, you're wrong. Don't care if you get offended. BigX did it better.
This is atrocious 😂 to me this is a country pop mash up and her vocal range does not in any way work with it. Please for the love of my dog, no country collabs with Nelly.
I don’t care if it’s country or not…I love it!
Nobody says anything about Rhiannon Giddens’ banjo and background vocals?  Geez.  I guess Rhiannon has to appear in the video and strip to get recognized too.  Don’t care what genre this is.  It’s good, Beyonce doesn’t have to strip to make it a hit, and y’all are clueless if you can’t recognize the OTHER Grammy award winning artist on this song…
Fhrfdgrfdgf😢
Now she prostitute country 😢
Franklin IS back
beyonce could be kanyes next gf. she is also running around half naked all the time
I go to. A dance called Elite star I have to do this  dance
This is no where near being country. This song is horrible as well as the video...
This is terrible .
Beyoncé copy Elodie?
Don't get the video. Hä?
To all country music gatekeepers, "we love this and we call it country" in your face😂
Strange ass video 😂 she doesn’t match with country at all this is beyond bizarre
Came here cause was tired about hearing about how this song is not country lmao it's definitely not
There's nothing good about this song. Crap thrown together in 30 seconds.
Is Beyoncé from Texas?
TAKE BACK OUR CREATED GENRE BEYONCE!!!
People arguing if it's country or not lmao it's just a song
HeereeeeY, WELL ALRIGHT! GEEEEET IT BEYONCE, SING THAT COUNTRY S*IT!!!!
So why is it that MGK made a pop punk album and he was vilified and everyone said he was "changing genres" but Beyonce can make a "country-esque" song and she's not switching genres and this song is blowing up on Tiktok..... Um... Double standards in Hollywood much?
This is horrible
and this song is not anywhere near country just bc it has texas in it dosent mean its country....
This girl isnt even near where country i hate her and how she is trying to trun country literly bye and this song is shit
horrible sound
Y'all are crazy if you think this is country. She just put texas in the song, almost completely exposes her chest and y'all are gushing over it. What utter bullshit this is completely disrespectful to what country music really is
He'll no
Beyonce is country!!! lovely song
She not country she still sing garbage
Wow, absolutely incredible. I never thought that the video would be better than a song and the video is terrible. You destroyed country music. There's an old saying you should stick with what you know. Please leave country music alone. What a country music do so. Terrible to you that you had to come over to country music, and do this terrible thing.
I suppose if I have to watch the same over and over on loop, it might as well be this
She's not doing anything but standing in one spot with a replay.. cute outfit though.. glad she's going back to the roots..
How the fuck is this country? This is far from it!!!!
This is so far from being country ...what a joke and an insult to country music
Soy la única que no entiende esta performance🤷🏻‍♀️
It’s so hilarious I love it!!!!!!!!
lmao this isn't country and never will be . Only people calling it country were either paid to say it or are just doing it because they are part of the bee hive that rides her nuts like she can't do no wrong. She also isn't doing anything new black woman have done country before and it was real country not this bull crap 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
She’s always got to let us know that she’s in the illuminati 👁️ The fact that she’s so obvious about it and flaunting it in our faces is disgusting and disturbing.
Just listened to it for the first time. Country is better now with all the commercialized snowflakes out of the picture. Now this, lol give a brake.  Sounds like crap.
Froze on me I said Sean ever go sideways on Bey she's from Texas she gonna get her Dad on you
Hahhhahahshs mnipulated people . This aint country
Not your lane. STAY OUT! Too R&B sounding.
They saved on video production for sure
juss remember, jay is hittin that. So always believe in yourself, fellas. Oh and be a billionaire and you can pull kitty like that too
Here comes Franklin
Why is this song so ass
Stick to your own genre. You suck at country sorry not sorry
Flashing the hand sign of Baphomet “as above, so below”, while covering the left eye with the serpent. You gotta be so unaware to not see how her success is attributed to selling her soul to the Satan. All of Hollywood is satanic. Covering the left eye is the feminine symbol of Satan.
Love it ❣️
Boring video , and why does she want everyone to see a fake boobs???
Hell, didn't know this was Beyonce. I think she found her niche. This is honestly the best I have heard her sound. Don't kill me folks. I am not a Beyonce fam. She has a couple of catchy tunes, but I never that she had a particularly good voice. This song hightlights her voice the best that I've ever heard.
Go babygirl go!! Love it;)
Beyoncé+ country= not that good for my ears (not being rude
Snake over one eye. They don't even hide it anymore.
I want to see Luke Combs squeeze into that. Or, better yet, Jelly Bean.
This sucks. She needs to keep that shit and her outfit where she has been at. And I HATE country music. This is worse than any of that shit.
Putting a little guitar and violin in a song doesn't make it country.
This aint COUNTRY, this is just plain shit
I don't care if I get shot for this or not... this is not country music. county music has a value system that accompanies it, and she does not adhere to that value system
What is this video?
❤
lol, this is not a good song. It sounds like it was written by Randy Newman. I guess anyone gets an award.
Periot with the tea sis you ate that up slayyyyy, my favorite song right no this ain't Texas by Beyonce
I love Beyonce, but I'm not a fan of this song.
Of course she does country it’s the only genre she hasn’t done to death
Repetitive and boring AF
She needs to stick to her music
show bubs...
What husband woud EVER let his wife do this in public?  She is a mother.
I feel bad for her. She doesn't even know she's a slave. I weep for her kids.
What a ripe piece of propaganda notes. The one thing about country music is that it is authentic and this is KNOT authentic AT ALL!
Why is it necessary that she is naked? What on earth.
She is so incredible and gifted i love her.
What is the purpose of sexualizing the song, cover up, it's not about you, it's about music.
She could of done a better video,  really not appropriate for her younger fans.
Who told Beyonce that it's enough to flash your tits for 4 minutes to call it a video, and people will watch it?   Because whoever told her that, they were right.
amateur video
I’m going to repeat… this is t country…. Just because it has some country selects. But it is more than a song…. I was skeptical at first, not about her able to sing country… she can sing anything better than so many…. But this song has a meaning that’s not about what one thinks it’s about.  Beyonce  is no fool.  She’s is playing all of you… Beyonce is telling you something here in a funny way.  This ain’t Texas….
Spend money on a music video Beyonce.
I’ve heard plenty of better artist but she is good at her own genre this doesn’t represent Texas I’m from Texas and women dont dress like that here maybe in Florida
This is mf fireee right here I’m not a fan of country music like that but QUEEN B ate this down seriously I cannot stop listening queen b foreverrrrr❤️Beyoncé is everything she Litterally makes anything sound good
Not country sorry not sorry
Garbage 🗑
Boy how did she master all those dance moves
Tractor in a tornado..... Tell me when her wife and dog comes home...
Why is she half naked. When did country singers start wearing nothing. She has a gorgeous body and she's looking trashy. The sad part is little girls look up to her and she's okay with being half naked.
Pour molten lead in my ears over playing this BS.
Men of culture gathered together again :)
Elle aurait pu faire un meilleur clip vidéo
"Hey its Franklin"
This ain’t country or even close😂
This song is basic & boring. I almost fell asleep listening & didn’t finish it 🥱
Wait a minute is that the official video her standing there walking with those skimpy clothes on? Oh no, the song was cute but that outfit she had on was dreadful what’s up with that eye thing lol. Why couldn’t she wear like a little cute skirt or something? She doesn’t have to be super country dressed up but we’re a little skirt wear some damn boots.
I keep seeing posts about this so I came to listen.... I dont see why so much hate? I mean its not my cup of tea but its not bad
Hey it's Franklin!!!!
Do you even have a bra on? Ewwww
Loved the tune, but enough with the nudity.  Have some dignity!
Nice sound. I’m suprised it isn’t more victim/grievance oriented; or at least insulting or hostile to county folks. I like it, didn’t expect to.
This has to be one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard
Nooooo!!! The song is beautifull💙 the video Sucks 🥹🫣. I am honest don’t be upset . 😌
Your such a beautiful and talented woman.
Truth is country music was originally sang by colored folk as they use to say lol love my people 🤣💪🏾
It does  have the " Hey its Franklin "  beat to it
Stunning Beyonce!🤠💐🙌
I put a condom on to watch this video 😮‍💨
Jay-z stop yo triflin. Dear gawd
This song not that good
This is a stupid song, and it's not country music it's r&b country she just need to stay in her lane
The musicianship is impressive, hooks are catchy and all while also redeeming the roots of country music. Beyonce might be doing it for the charts and awards but damn if she ain't delivering with a beautiful sound that almost went ancient in the mist of "pop country" which seems to have no musical talent.
Sorry can't help but think she's trying to beat Taylor Swift but it's a cool song but not for me
Very talented, I just don't dig the way she dresses, vulgar is cringe.
What is this trash 😅😂😂
This is not country! Before anyone gets all offended: Taylor Swift never was either 😂
Nice breast!😄🤪😄
🥇
There's nothing county about this just some half naked girl
This is the instrumental from the theme song from the show kids show Franklin to!
Everyone talkin about this song still, had to check it out, and it sucks... Beyoncé can sing, but the lyrics aren't great nor is the sound. Yall are trippin just because it's Beyonce.
Trashy
And btw ts ain’t country 🤦🏼‍♂️ no where near it go listen to some damn George straight yall will see the difference
this aint no country song
Why the hell I hear the  sweet home Alabama kinda?
Ok i like the song,  but this video is the worst. Why does she have to come out with no clothes on ? Keep it classy Beyoncé!
Not country but it’s ok
And mgk was called a sellout. 😂 go queen b but the hypocrisy is unreal.
This song grew on me and now it's stuck in my head.
Very Nice Do You 😊
Yesssss ❣️
👎
La canción es buena, pudo haber realizado un mejor video pero prefirió irse por lo simple, salir sin ropa, lo que que deja más… que triste que no tome en serio la cultura de Texas que no son mexicanos pero tampoco gringos
Country music is about family love beer and breakups...it is not ratchet!!
No man this music video is soo stupid... is this all she does the whole video through?
👎this not it Beyonce
Beautiful. But I don't see the country element.  Hopefully the pop station won't sell out to the country music stations. Keep her pop music. Super cute though. Beyonce where are them country boots 👢
Beyoncé is a brilliant musician. Texas Hold 'Em is an excellent song that showcases her versatile talent. She deserves so much better that to be whitewashed and cheesecaked in this  unimaginitive and repetitive video. The director should be ashamed.
This is a pivot. Diversifying is valuable, you never know who you'll inspire. 👼🏽
This was fantastic!  She really nailed this song.  She's beautiful too, but the song really is what is great.  Did i just say that?  Lord I'm getting old.
nahh i dont even know wtf this is.
This sounds like fake country for example old town road
WOW!  Thought she'd have come up with something more traditional  expected more from her. Can't imagine hearing on radio.  Partially nude photos will sell...
😂🤣🤣🤣 okay.
Trash 🗑️
Riding that Mexican O.T hype haha 😂
What's up with this music video? That was weird
Shittiest song I’ve ever fucking herd. This isn’t fucking country. Listen to some damn 90s country if want to hear country. Not this shit
Not for me, pretty weak. And I like Beyoncé.
2024 and here again and again.
WoW, thats a great song.
Wow I love this ❤️
You can’t and you won’t bring Satan to country music, you are nothing but trash.  You will not bring it down to chest barely Ho level.  Alan Jackson was right to walk out on you .
Garbage 😂
I haven’t really liked Beyoncé’s music post 2003, but this is good!
2 👍
I’m impressed
I’m impressed
Break through
Música ruim clipe podre 🤮
So this is the song that has a lot of white folks butt hurt.
Nice song. Not country
Ehh the songs just doesn't match her.. It's not Beyonce style. I don't want new concept for singers I like there OG styles
Love her and love this! ❤🤠 We love you in Texas, B!
Beyonce is still that gal.....
This is awful, get a tee shirt and a life
She might as well just go completely topless and provide some entertainment value.
My father listen to country music where I grew up in Alabama. Thanks Beyoncé for bringing it back home ❤
There are two people in the comments   People who are country/ Beyoncé purest and think this song is a disgrace to one or both  And people who just enjoy the songs unique genre or the way the song sounds
Not country an just showing off body . Terrible singing an video
Girl please stopped !!!👎👎👎
Sucks plus video never changes
Happy Women's Month!
I know this is a completely corporate, market-driven move and it probably took a 20-member focus group to write it, but it's still more soulful and authentic than 95% of modern country.
Shes not even singing.
that aint country put sone damn clothes on and stop rappin
😪🤣🤣

BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" is in a close 3-way race for next weeks #1! Keep supporting!
A little gift
This shit ain't country but you say anything out comes the race  card
This song is so bad
Ion know if I’m trippin but it sounds like the lumineers ho hey song
Heard this and became an instant fan of whoever was singing it. Then I looked it up. Beyonce? Wow wow wow!
my grandma is nonstop with this son
The Proverbial Cowboy...."Beyonce ain't got nothin' on country music..."    Beyonce....."HOLD MY BEER."
Ughhh
I love the way she mixed country with hip hop
She can't sing country music  please please stop trying
How is this outfit considered country
The song was good but this outfit and video are ridiculous. Put clothes on and have some self-respect. You don’t have to be almost naked to get attention!
Dont get the video...tits out and all pow pow and repeat. Really!! absolute s#$%
franklin tune ?
1:00 love the song but not the music video she's so good at singing and is in her cowgirl era
WTAF? Great creative minds on this video. Song would've sold itself. Didn't need boobs.😢
Wait till Texas finds out how she was dressed, representing them 😶
Not she got the hilljacks mad in the comments 😭
❤❤❤ Das ist so schön ❤❤❤ Ich liebeeee es
This shit hot garbage damn Taylor swift really out here turning Beyoncé into a country singer lmao 😅😅😅😅 where’s the stupid ass bee hive at now lmao yo Taylor swift the female Eminem lol
Im from Houston
Good song stupid video like ground hog day wdf😂
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE YOU PUT ON BOOTS DOESNT MEAN YOUR COUNTRY
What an embarrassment.
❤️I ’m here for it queen❤️
Oh come on ! This is HiLarryOus !
Damn she’s really been showing a lot of skin lately
LOVE the song
That sucks. Stick to your own lane.
Button up ur shirt maam
Here we go now black people invented country music too, y'all jokes
Nope
When you're trying to get into country and don't know where to start, steal Franklins intro music, show some skin, and put on loop. Now you got a banger!
Wow...just wow. Just when I thought I couldn't see or hear anything more lame than the video/song, then I read all these comments........Song is garbage, video is garbage, which is worse? Up in the air.
I am in. It is so bonding.
This song is demonic it makes me depressed. ☠️💀☠️👺👹
❤
Where's her belly button? Body suit I guess
Franklin the turtle.......
From Queen B to Queen Nefertiti 😊
She´s talented, why show herself like that?, I love the song, the video is trashy, very low class
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Really proud of that finger
This is what it sounds like when you attempt country music without knowing anything about the context of what you're talking about.   This is absolutely grating on the ears and the lyrics are nonsense. Try again.
I have always liked her voice but why the profanity?
Certainly a catchy tune.  Could do without any unnecessary epitaphs.  But overall it’s a fun song.
This shit is trash
She is so cool and love her voice and music ❤
Great song but why is she running around  half naked? She has some real talent and doesn’t need her b….s to sell her music.
Shits ass
I ❤❤music bioncé
What is she selling here, music or a prelude to a pole dance? catchy tune, but why do all hip-hop r&b artist's have to interject curse words, or do they just have a limited vocabulary, the latter i guess. I admire her talent as singer, not her music choice, nor do I care to see her skin. I guessing her private life is also filled low morals.
Copying TS 😂
Sounds a lot like Franklin the turtles intro song
She allergic to clothes? 😒
Fun fact: Bey and Jay flew Lolita Express Airlines and are tight with notorious rapist, groomer, p3d0, abuser Diddy… Enjoy!
Aunt Texas and aunt no .. stick around   🍯
If this is country then I vote for the Spinners for the heavy metal hall of fame. This country porn.
Que clipe merda. Música meia boca do caralho
That Ain't Country Music. The way she's dressed nope making sure she's getting that one eye and good for You Beyonce give him hell. She's missing cowboy boots jeans and a nice shirt what a flying better that now she just looks stupid
I don’t see anything particularly special about this song. Beyoncé is a great artist, her vocals are amazing don’t get me wrong, I just don’t think this song was produced very well.
Video terrible song is awesome
Queeeeeeennn B! You are the best ❤
Absolutely shit!!!! Leave country music to us country folk. Stick with what you know glam squad, tweaking, hip hop.
Na weak
Strong woman 🤲🏽🫡 💪🏾
Hey its Franklin...
Lmfaoooo desperate
O wow u made me blush
Satan isn't happy just taking down the HIP HOP fans he is coming for the country music folks too. She is practically naked and the Illuminati eye stuff going on. PS the seam in the hose going in the back sweetie.
y no nipples on tiddy?
this reminds me of a weird recurring dream i have
damn she still bad af
Overplayed
Keep releasing more Country stuff. I like how people are getting triggered. 🤣 We live in such a sensitive society. People even have issues with you showing a little bit of cleavage as if the Female body is offensive. Men walk around topless all the time and people don't have any issues with that. A lot of dudes don't even look good topless.
gyattt damn
https://youtube.com/shorts/GkvPq2ISwA4?si=zAHYJpF43RyaWupA
This ain’t country. It’s pop with a banjo
This is disgusting. You're someone's mother. It's time to act like it and teach your daughters modesty.😊
Love this song.. ❤
The greatest of all time
Is this a porn or a music video about texas I'm confused
BEYDAY IS ER DAY
I agree with this man statements. “She can do what she wants as an artist,” says Boatwright. “If you don’t explore different things you become stagnant, but at the same time it’s just not country to me.” Country isn’t just about a certain twang to the guitar, he says, or throwing on a cowboy hat and saddling up a horse, especially if it’s Beyoncé’s hologram horse. It’s about storytelling, telling tales about the working class, writing music that “speaks to the soul”. Beyoncé’s success has catapulted her far away from everyday people just trying to get by, says Jim.  “It doesn’t matter that you came from Texas. It matters if you’re actually living a country lifestyle. It bothers me that her song is being called country.”
I currently have tonsillitis and this is the song they played at the doctor’s,tbh this song is good.
This song HITS. It feels so nostalgic and homey ☺
I can’t wait to not listen to this again.
🎶It’s a real live hoe down..🎶🤣
Absolutely awful and not country.  The video is horrible as well.  I like Beyoncé but sorry this totally sucks.
Would be a good linedance beat..
This is topping the country charts? It sounds good sonically don't get me wrong but it just sounds like a Beyonce song with a banjo. gotta have more twang in the song than just the banjo to be country lol I wanna hear her do some Toby Keith shit 😂 She could do it, even though she doesn't make my style of music I'd be lying if I said she isn't talented.
This gave me chills and not in a good way. Hot ass garbage 🗑
Embarrassing!! Nothing like country
THE SONG IS TRASH, I WISH A WHITE PERSON SUNG IT SO I COULD STILL SAY ITS TRASH WITHOUT BEING CALLED RACIST
Sorry Beyoncé but this does not make since
Stupid
it's about as country as a white collar guy driving a Hyundai Santa Cruz with all terrain tires....in the city
Too much boob and not enough dancing
FBA PEOPLE ARE VERY TALENTED AND VERY 🤓 SMART
Love Beyonce, Love this song.
YOU GO GIRL🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤
I love it yahooo😅
This is fucking awful.
LAME, LAME, LAME a corny thing. This video is not giving nothing. No message or anything. Umm...expecting a little bit more that what's giving. I can do that.
I get it. It ain't my style but I get it. Respect!
😍🔥👏👏❤️😘
As a woman I am FED UP that a female singer has this need of dressing off. Beyonce is called queen B, but she still has this need to dressed off, otherwise she will not be able to sell records. What kind of insecure queen is that?
It's the franklin the turtle theme song
Sounds like ebonics rap to me. That sure AF ain't country.
Love it ❤🎉
Song sucks but I do like other songs of hers.
Boring
Y’all glazing the fuck outta this, this terrible
This song sucks but I hear Franklin the turtle did it better
No no no... please don't...🤦
Just cus u say certain words don't make it country. This is more pop or bop
Nasty version of seven of nine
I knew it sounded familiar…. It’s from Franklin! Great Canadian cartoon

The song is awful 🤣 I think it’s hilarious that people are listening to this trash just to be contrarians.
It's sad Beyonce had to steal from Franklin the turtle.
Beyoncé really needs to stay with the type of music she is good at .. I enjoy many of her songs, however .. Her husband is so desperate for her to win an Album of the year that she chose this route!  Sorry doesn’t have my vote Doesn’t look like she is representing Country.. The video looks like an overexposed fashion show that has nothing to do with Country Music ..
This song is a disgrace to country music 🤬
Terrible song my god. Is that what you call country music? 😂
"Ma'am this is a wendy's"
Now that’s cultural appropriation 🧠
did Taylor Swift write this? Or is it suppose to sound like a Swift song???
Cousin Eddie, if I woke up with my head sown to the carpet I wouldn’t be more surprised than I am now.  This is about as country as a 5th Avenue penthouse.
Dad: a nice song mom: Beyoncé not bad bro: good weird sis: boobs 😏
I WISH I CAN MEET U but sadly I’m in Dubai ❤ stay safe x
When ppl use your song some of them hate it but i stands up for you:) i love you beyoncē
Beyonce is sooooo sweet!
Not interested 😒
This shit garbage af
The only reason stations are playing this is bc shes black  You cant call this junk county   Its a disgrace to the name
Compared to the classics. Or even the trash country from the early 00s . The songs garbage. Every lyric is a re write of a thousand other songs before. No soul. Because she didnt write it. Only performs it. This seems like a cash grab. All you suckers are falling for it
Sorry for the silly question, but can someone tell me why she has her boobies out?
Love it❤❤❤❤
this shit is fucking ass
I feel like I heard this somewhere 😢
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Take this shit down! Pls for my ears!!!!!!!!
whos corny ass idea was this
Awful, especially this video 😢
You’re no goddess therefore you should not be worshipped like one, the real goddesses possess GOD in them.
This such a beautiful song, I love that you can hear Bey’s Texan accent so natural and authentic. Those low notes are like smooth honey.
I’m from Saint Louis and when I say Beyoncé got me feeling TEXAS❤
https://youtu.be/bzluenMUtlE?si=tP0By4terRj1ROnB
❤❤❤❤ Love the Realness!!! Texas holds you precious... God Bless..
Someone trying hard to still be as relevant as they were in the early 2000s to 2010s. Ridiculous.
Anyone 2025?
Country music has its roots strongly in Irish and Scottish folk music.
I really don’t listen to Beyoncé - but I like the beat of this one. It’s got a nice kick to it…… it’s a real live Boogie… and a real live Hoe down… don’t be a B*tch!! Ooopssss….. spurs…. Boots……. 😂
Texas said your song is terrible! Please stop the bleeding!
WHAT A SONG!!!
Trash😂
Is this her song 😂😂😂😂
I love Beyonce  and I like the song but  we want an rnb album a Real one no trap and no rapping from Bey..  I feel like she just looking for more awards..  CMA and CMT here come Beyoncé..
She needs some clothes on
I enjoyed the song just fine, had a nice country flare. Video was boring as all get out. At least it must have been fairly inexpensive to make since it just repeats the same 10 seconds of footage. Prefer so many of her other videos so much more. But as far as a song, it's a decent country song.
Might as well just take the jacket off that’s why it’s got a lot of views because this song ain’t even mid lol
this song seriously sucks ass. beyoncé ain’t country. this is appalling and another quick cash grab, another “hey look at me over here” moment.
This is so ass, it’s not even country and nether are you.
Trash
Stupid video
The video budget was 10 bucks.
Fine romance without being screwed with…. Without our house yelled at to take the electric chair! Hmmmmm, what do say Doll, someplace loud enough for how you look on Rockstar? Eric hiluscinating and protesting
It's a shame she has no respect or pride for herself.  She should have just done penthouse
Toby Keith Performs "Don’t Let the Old Man In" at the 2023 People's Choice Country Awards | NBC  LISTEN TO REAL COUNTRY YAWL  SO CALLED COUNTRY FANS, IF YOU DARE TO HEAR!!! Not many people get to sing a goodbye song at the end of their life but Mr. Toby Keith did it in a beautiful tear jerker way , you will always be missed Big Dawg !!!! Thanks Legend!
Stick to your genre. This is absolutely ridiculous and you can't even make a video to it. That says alot. Very disappointing.
Why so many haters? I love her, and I love the song.
Put some damn clothes on! Illuminati graduate!
I think they could have done better with the video....
Mos well be naked
I will never forget the day this song was written I still think all of you are beautiful
The trust in that jacket….
First beyonce that hits home 👏 ♠️  this is a gem 👏❤️
I’m okay with her song, but I don’t like how she dress up like that, u could almost barely c her nipple on the left side. Hate it.
Hey its franklin........
Love the music and the lyrics, but the attire was a new low.
This is just no.
Queen B 🤩
Stupid video. Horrible song.
I'm watching half of this an all she is doing is doing it over over again like boring
Nope
This ain't country...
Easily one of the worst songs I've heard in a while
Stupid video
I think the song is ok...she has always had a good voice...but I think the outfit is unnecessary and over the top....unless looking for some attention...if the song is good and the talent is there...why is this necessary?
This is crap
I got more respect for the singers portrayed in star wars.
If this is country, I'm out!
Stick to pop!!
Estou sentindo cheiro de Grammy
This might be a country song if Miranda Lambert or somebody was singing it but you can't take R&B pit of Beyonce
This isn't country and this is a shitty video
OMG😮
Eminently missable! Next....
She sounds so good
Fakest comments ive seen everything is paid lmao
Beyonce is not country. Gtf outta here
I hope this isn’t the official video, it’s terrible.😢
This ain’t Texas? If not,  where is it?😂
Just because you say Texas, doesn’t make it a country song🤦🏼‍♀️
Catchey as fuk for sure. But it's a very basic lyrical song. It will be near forgotten in a few months...But she'll win cmt awards like crazy
Trash 🗑️
Not that impressed.
Can we just talk about how amazing Beyonces body is looking!!??
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Absolutely nasty and disgusting!
Hey its Franklin!!
This song sucks
NO ES TEXAS!!
Cute song but a dumb ass video. I don’t understand the video at all and a bit prerogative for country.
If you like than you should have put a shirt on it
Beyoncé has always been country she’s from Houston, always had a twang!! ❤❤❤ we need a album!
Where's her clothes. That's not a country outfit.
Beyoncé has always been country! She’s always had a twang! She’s from Houston.   Haters shh please, ❤❤❤❤
Thank you Beyonce, I get everything your singing, and the Images,,, Sweetheart you have did something with this song ,,, that I haven't seen in years ,,, Now first let me tell whoever. I am from southeast Kentucky,, Girl you hit it rite in the Bulls eye ! Great song writing , Great singing , Great arrangements ,  Great Video ,this song is why people Listen to music and Love it ,,,Now some people may not understand this song or dont want to ,,,I understand it and get it ,,, I think I already had it Just waiting for it to arrived, and it did with great ambassador musical message to whoever likes great music ,,,this is a revolution song , Like when Little Richard , and Elvis Presley and The Beatles arrived ,,,I think every artist no matter how big in the world ears is lifted like a Meercat looking around rite about now ,,,this is one them songs ,, game changer standard setter that changes a society and reshapes people in a good way ,,,Its a very honest feel good powerful breakthrough rise above every one I have enjoyed this song very much ,,,,,its has broken thru Like the sun on a cloudy day with a nice breeze ,,,,Beyonce and this song she has got people up and dancing and feeling good ,,ant that what music is all about ? I think so ...Thanks !
If blacks made country music and if she was white this would be bad
All these comments reinforce what I've been saying all along. Just because she puts out an album and calls it country, doesn't mean it's taking over the country music world and then all the country fans are embracing it. It just means that the same group of fans who buy her stuff anyway are going to buy this one and that's where most of her sales are going to come from. True country fans are not saying words like "slay" and "yass queen."  This album is nothing more than a cash grab and a  political statement.
Junk. Put your clothes back on and stick to R&B
Its low grade country music
I actually did not think it was gonna be a good song but it is
Video is super boring
Lots of plastic surgery
Can’t stand her and this song sucks
This is terrible why even bother.  Just terrible
This isn't country at all.
Keep to your genre Beyoncé I said what I said
why is she a robot tho? song is good but this video is strange
Garbage
Finally bringing it back to real music! 🙏🏻 Yayy Beyonce!
Htown stand up
She's  awesome ❤❤❤
I'm sorry but there's nothing country here
Why does Beyoncé like coming out with the dumbest songs ever SMDH
Isn't this the theme rhythm to that Franklin turtle cartoon?
I love this song ❤❤❤❤
That Voice....Most Wonderful !
WTH?! Thar outfit is tacky!
Intro reminds me of the "Franklin" theme song
She's dressed like a Nicki Minaj in her last video! Sex does sells!
Kilt it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude, her and this song, and add it to some Chapel Hart, and we got a THING going!
I fucks with this song. I know it ain't the most country song, but I like it. Its more of an R&B song with country vibes as opposed to a country song.  Still a good one
It sucks
🤠🤠🤠
Literally in loveeee
I luv this song
On my school play one of my line’s is ok the game is Texas Hold‘em one eye            Jacks are wild ❤
My grandma even likes this song
This is so bad😅 our your chest away country music isn't this auto tune and titties bs
Pretty horrible.  I thought they said she was going to do a country song.  I have no idea what that piece of crap was.
Ew
Happy
Franklins theme song....its a ripoff !!
It's the Franklin song
This is too much hip hop to be country. Also why is everything just repeating this isn’t a song it’s just a few words on repeat including the video.
Proof she buys her number 1s and grammy's, this is beyond shit, as usual overrated beyonce, also you cant put on a cowboy hat and claim you are a country singer
This is soooooo much better than her normal garbage.
Beyonce, you done it. I love it.
Beyonce ,during a country song with  Texas  Hold em.
7 of 9?
Man she's fawking horrible.  🤢🤮
Cute....until I realized that is some kids mum....😂😮
Its giving loading(for a video)
When you cant write anymore hit songs and your career is in the wind, just strip naked infront of a camera and say your country
🗑
This video is offensive. This has nothing to do with Texas values. She needs to put some clothes on.
Yeee haaa
Oh, look. It only took one of her songs to turn all of you punks into country music lovers! 😂 Sheep
She's  good  on her original talent, but funnier this ain't  Country Music. I applauded her talent  in the music industry, but if this is a testimonial of art Country Music talent . It's  not good
I actually have to listen to this everyday. Otherwise it'll just play in my head all day until I do 😂 It's so dang good. Thank you, B 💜
I actually have to listen to this everyday. Otherwise it'll just play in my head all day until I do 😂 It's so damn good. Thank you, B 💜
All I need is you all to breathe and love me
This ain't country
First of all why do they have or have naked, and no she doesn't do well on country
Queen b u da goat keep up tha great work omm😊
Nice song, but why does she look like a Borg?
Alright
I've listened to this about a dozen times now.  For the life of me I can't find any coherence in the lyrics.  If this ain't Texas fine, where is it?  I guess it is fine for two second spans of attention, but honestly try to read this from top to bottom and make sense of it.  Eight bars of banjo, and a mish-mash of country music buzz-words does not make this country.  It is interesting.  It does sound good.  It is a dance tune.  Nashville is surely loving it.  But country? no not at all.
Beyoncé what is this
Terrible
Don’t understand the dress code
😍😍😍😍
Baphomet
some days I pretend  that everything is fine right now I feel great see she  and my words won`t come out , trying not to feel maybe you`re not alone  in this constant I Wish things were diamonds all the time , trying not to feel but youare in this constant side , i`m trying not to fear baby if you laughter crazy my words will come out ,M.M
Hey, c'est franklin !
I decree that *Every* recording artist.That's worth their salt. Should record at least *one*  Country and or Folk album.🙂
Such a creative music video… 😆😂 I wish I was this creative making millions just for film one little thing once… and they just loop it. This is not country.
This song is trash
Worst damn “country song I have ever heard “
I just wish there was some music playing with the video. Sucks that it’s just some lady shaking up and down a lot and they recorded that instead.
Love the music but don't like the video....doesn't seem to match....
Bruh this ain't country
Sucks
👸👑 welcome queen
She need to call @anitta for help with a really good Video performance.
This sure ain't country music
The song stands on it's own. Didn't have to see this.
I just came to say Hey it's Franklin! 🐢
Beyonce is a major recording star and Texas born and bred.  It was only a matter of time before she recorded a C&W song.
🍈🍈
Not a country video
Do we really need to see her "boobs" seems they run out of Idee
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" remains at #1 for its 3rd week on the Billboard Hot 100! Keep pushing! 👑🐝
This isn't country by any means. Who TF sings about a tomato in their spaghetti and thinks its country.
Songs so so kinda sounds like Laura Bell Bundy's style,but the video 🙄
Can't say that I was the biggest Beyone fan beforehand. But this is 🔥And  props to her for exploring different genre's 🙂
Dis ain't country
We don’t have basements in Texas🎉
It's March 2024.... Watch what happens next  Virgo is 100 💯%
Wow. She she sucks at country music two
Hey it's Franklin! coming over to play! 🐢🐢🐢
She needs to fucking retire she's an embarrassment
Beautiful
Is this the official video?
I've listened to all genres my whole life , love country, she's talented but this isn't country. These new country singers and the ones jumping genres can do what they want but stop saying shit is what it's not.   As for everyone going crazy cause she's a black woman in country ..... She's not in country music.... There have been actual black country singers that deserve far more praise than Beyonce with this mess
Hey Texas
Enjoyed the song but the video needs a lot of work
If this is not naked then what is? Perveyoncé
Were is her shirt
I appreciate her branching out but Texas houses don't have basements lol.
I don't 😢see country...I wanted to like this.  Clothes might have helped.
My ears hurt.
Blackifying country music. Daaamn! We got ours a national tragedy. We gonna need to pull people from building that Mexican wall and focus on this nonsense. Hold my keys, and don’t scratch that Lexus. 💃🏽
A MAIOR DO MUNDO EU TE AMO
This is kinda ass ngl sounds like something out of a shitty 2011 disney movie but beyonces voice is amazing as always
there was clearly a budget for this video. A very tight one.
Memories!!! " Hey it's Franklin". ❤❤
This is a remake of crazy game of poker by oar … she’s been a thief on this for years but it’s hard to prove it.  It’s in my playlists.  I became a visual inspirational writer through Mayan traditions and she and her network promote the imbalances of the visuals.
Trash
justin jones speech about it
Good song, HORRIBLE video. No country stations will be playing this though. It's just a money grab!
A versatile QUEEN
Bout time Australia heard an African American singing Country, legend  beautiful
Oh lord get her out of country music
Trust me, Beyoncé, I did not watch the didn't watch the video. My mom said I couldn't watch the video but I do listen to this song and yeah
I wish there was a laugh react option
I'm eleven years old I want to be friends with blue eyed me please
Trash
The music's good. Talent's real. Why be naked?
Heard about the song so I had to listen, it's awful, I just turn the volume down and watch her
🤔 2+2=4 what is Beyonce+Miley=puppet's on a string ....
OMG she is so awesome & you know JZ is proud of her, I bet he’s helping producing her too!
Horrible, wtf?
Gross
lovely song. Great singer
Why she look white
Awesome song and video❤
This is awful
This is the worst thing I've ever heard
This is trash
Beyonce you way to good for Nazi Nashville. You make them girls look UGLY too!
The song is good ...the video well not so much
I remember this beat from the cartoon Franklin in the 90’s
Seriously why is she almost naked!! Omg seriously
I swear this song sounds a bit like a Gretchen Wilson song. Not the words but the tune.
This is so stupid. 💯
Hoe down is right.
This shit is not country 😂
you know what's funny,  none of beyonce fans would listen to this song in a million years if it was sung by any other country artist. but because beyonce is signing it... "omg it's amazing, you go queen!!"
Hate this song
I'm 74 and I  can't stop watching, I've been home bound for a while and this song has got me moving in my chair, Thank you so much Beyonce I love you ❤❤❤
How about being an example to your little girls! Put some clothes on B!
Bro trust the jacket more than I trust my self
Ummm…. What?
Omg I love this song so much but why is she just shooting a fake gun for like the whole video? 😂lol
Absolute trash.
Dang Bea. I gotta give it to you. You got more moves than Docalax. Ex-lax.😂 And I see your blackness ! Starting with that superbowl. You didn’t have to do it. Your contemporaries never did! I took note of that✊🏿
It’d be better to label this as pop not country
The song is OK but the video is stupid
Song is ass
Didn’t know she can speak American South accent Lol
Why is she singing over the intro song to "Franklin the Turtle".
I would love for her to not dress so un revealing. I wonder will she ever grow out of this.
How is this beating carnival
What’s with the Cyborg head gear?? What are they trying to desensitize us to now??   Google: Clone Aid Canada. And Saudi Arabia gives citizenship to a female ROBOT. Hollyweird always shows us what’s coming via “entertainment” (google the Latin meaning of that too)
So execessive repeticion !! Thats is the official video ??? Wowww, be more criative with the milliions you have to apport on these videos.
😂
This video is dumb
This is utter garbage on repeat... I hope to God they aren't trying to call this country
Hey It’s Franklin
This shit ain’t country! Wtf!
Hmm love the song, but the video,  What the actual!!!!!
This song is not really good I’m sry but like put more song in to it like 😢 very devastating 2/10 and like why there’s a tornado in the city I’m sorry but I don’t like this👎🏻 2/100
I love you❤❤
U sucked then u still suck
Yeah
Just because you add a banjo doesn't make it country music, this sound like a mix between hip hop and gospel
Hey its Franklin coming over to play lol Beyonce's team dropped the ball with this one 😂
😤😤😤😤😤 does she need fabric donation? Seems she needs one
Overrated 😂
I like the song but not the video.
Might be her worst song
G🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤🎉❤
This shit not  Country, get ur ass back in the Studio do better
This is so terrible and formulaic. Oh yeah, it’s Beyoncé… She doesn’t write her music. She is a product developed by producers at some label.
How to make Franklin theme song to a meme song: Beyonce + Texas abortion laws + Random clips of ppl on Instagram/TikTok "Taking care of their unborns"
Nope. So much nope!  This is ridiculous.
Beyonce, I wanted to write a lengthy comment, then seven words summed it up "Beyonce is the Epitome of Everything love".
We never danced at our wedding in front of both of our families
Not for me unfortunately
It AINT Texas?? I thought this was country lol wth
F.i.T Still would.
Queen Baphomet bringing that demon imagery into country now. Pray for these people.
WTF
So are these artificial intelligence visualizers replacing actual music videos? Looks like something went wrong the imagery is stuck  on repeat
Guess she has to perform showing nakedness to get attention. Sad and not real country
Im sorry B but tell your writers they need to do a better job
Terrible video. WTF IS THE POINT?
Trying to take the lime light off Taylor swift, cause she started with country
Sounds like shit
No... Just no
This is more pop. Country music TELLS BEAUTIFUL STORIES #MartinaMcbride #CarrieUnderwood #Reba #ShaniaTwain #TryAgain
Amazing song!!!!
ARTIST OF OUR LIFETIMES
Number one for a second week
Trash
This is trash
She’s looki white
why dont she do awesone videoclips anymore??? Only some shitty visualisers???
Bluegrass+ Hip Hop= Blue Hop and I'm here for it!! ❤❤
Pop into the comments. Mostly race related divisive garbage. America is sick. Its a song ffs!
I really like the song and it's wonderful, I was also expecting the music video honestly
This song is fucken shit who the fuck even is this, poor ol Kenny Rogers would be turning in his grave a song about parking a fucken Lexis
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Girl you have oht done youreself beingbthe o ly black womennhit the 1 spot kn rhe Country billboard! I love youre song ehat will you do next?! CO GRADULATIONS☆♡☆
This is stupid, people are turning the world into devilish and demons crap! Now Beyoncé believes in satan and her husband ? Crazy 😂
No self respect.
the song isnt bad but the video is tacky and trashy looking
Am I the only person who thinks she has litterally NO shirts in her wardrobe 😤
BEYONCE IS 💯 TRASH 🗑️ PERIOD
Is this the real video
❤❤❤
Dumbest,cheapest video I've ever seen,the song after this ain't Texas,sucks.sorry
anyone thinks this is just sooooooo GOOD:)
She’s made country sleazy    She does not sound country at all even though the song does. It’s gimmicky
This is a JOKE!  Someone take her away from the mic already.  Nothing about this is country.
Crap in a big azz drum
This shits ass
Beyoncé made this song so I guess we all gotta like this garbage😅
Porn and country don’t mix. Stick to your own shit
Esto es Magia!….. me encantó!
The cowboys are trash
Like the sound, do not like her outfit.
This song is terrible
would hold em - tx
look how big them things. praise jayz
no one talking about how beyonce looking? wow
Hey its Franklin
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been Shazamed over 600k times! Keep Shazaming! It helps with radio play! 👑🐝
Garbage is all im gonna say. She knows nothing about the southern life. So if you dont you shouldn't try to be lyrical on it. One vacation trip doesn't count
Language!
This is the stupidest song i have ever heard in my entire life.
How dare you show that much skin in a country video. I don't approve at all. You must be the devil.
Heyyyy it's franklin
Мынау не енды?
Texas proud and I’m Dominican but I live here
NOT COUNTRY, HAS NO CONCEPT OF DECENT QUALITY!!!!! GLORIFIED POP SONG
This ain't country
This song sucks! And the video is dumb.
All the hate not working in these comments😂 #1 song on the billboard hot 100 for 2weeks💪👑 The QUEEN. 27yrs on top & still hasn't peaked. Keep hating though 😘
While beyonces voice is great. Theurics and video are severely lacking substance. Say what you will but just bc you love beyonce does not make everything she does wonderful.
She has no shirt weird I would not do that bc I’m 20
It’s boring song Taylor swift is better
She started to copy Taylor Swift career path..
Cringe
Is that seriously the best they could do visually?  I was hearing the song elsewhere and liked it but this weird visual ruined it for me.
Ok?
Rebel blacks in country music like blacks do whites in rap music.
Stupid video.
I won't be a bitch Bey, throwing on my Dan Post boots meet me at the Honky Tonk.
terrible
Oh…
She needs to put some clothes on
When is she going to do her own dance ⁉️🤷 because the pictures are not we are looking for from her she can show her body on stage at her concerts, ok like she has always done 👍 come on Bey be nice girlfriend🤷 👍🫶🤩❤
Hell nah
I dont get country from this. Its boring. This is nother usual effort
Here's my thing. I'm a nelly fan but  Nelly isnt country either yet HE was accepted. Beyonce should be too. Country music should quit being so closed minded
This is GARBAGE
What a state she looks, she really thinks this is cool, disgusting 😠
Worst cowgirl outfit ever....is it required to show/flash your breasts woman. !!
❤❤❤❤
Just wtf..
This sucks donkey nuts
The first part of the video turns me off....
Franklin the Turtle finally gets a HIT SONG!
New season of Franklin looks weird.
Poor attempt at country
❤❤❤❤😮😮 say is it you 0:58  oh wow girl you kissing good👍🏽👍🏽
It doesn't work for me, and I love Beyonc'e alway's have and will.
1:44
Not country…
This shit sucks ass.
.....i was really interested to hear this song as #1...Beyonce is extremely talented and can be considered as one of the best vocalist ever....#2....she is from Texas so I figured she probably had some country songs she liked and maybe had some "country" experiences to sing about...  But I did not care for the song.  Not sure what all the hype is about with this song.... compared to her other works this is something I wouldn't even think to mention.  I think the lyrics were odd and had me wondering if they were just super specific to her life or something.  But really this feels like a poor attempt at making some type of line-dance/tiktok dance.  It really feels like this song was made specifically for tiktok.    Beyonce can do better than this.  I bet if she put some real effort into a country song...she would have a hit that resonates with millions.
Meh. I don't like how she dropped this. Stole Usher's moment. And I don't like her trying to be inducted into the Country whatever. And I don't like her trying to be the first black artist to do so when others are way ahead of her. It makes it pretty hard to like the song, personally. Also. It's not country.
She’s literally doing the behemoth pose.
Clipe chato
🤣🤣🤣🤣 please, this some BS 🤣🤣🤣
Beyonce is pragtig en haar musiek nog beter! Groete uit LIma Peru!
Song sucks so let’s show boob 🥴
If white rappers are culture vultures for doing hip hop then is she a culture vulture 2 ?
Love the song
Good song, stupid video.
Country music was first created by blacks before the Whiteman hijacked it
The background song is from the Franklin theme song is hilarious
Definitely gives Kill Bill The Return Soundtrack vibes
Love Beyonc
Why do all these ladies always have to be half naked, is the visual to distract? Also this is not country...its more like bluegrass gospel.
Is it me or does this sound like Adele send my love
Yet another song without a proper video.
Songs amazing video has no effort to it sadly
This is the most ridiculous video i have watched. If she wants to cross over to the country genre she needs to understand and respect  the culture. What a waist of film 🤮
she could play one blues now that was cool
As above so below, baphomet hand sign lol, and the one eyed symbolism.   This woman is not a good person.
Franklin the turtle song 😂😂😂 it does sound like that theme song! And this video is dumb, she just does the same thing over and over.
🗑️
I like it. I dont think its country music.  She's singing about her kind of hoe down in a dive bar. We've all been there. Lol! Of course the cussing and lack of clothing has to be part of it. It's her MO  If you don't like it - keep moving.
I wish to marry Beyoncé from me
Its a good song, but why does she have to curse through the whole song and dress like a tramp?
It's not a bad song but it ain't country. The fact that this song and jelly roll and a bunch of others are on the country station and considered country tells me one thing. Country is dead at this point.
Copy right infringement. 😂 Played Franklin the theme song and it matches up. Same beat. 😂
It's horrible.
🎼🤟♥️♥️♥️🤟🎼 Looove Country Cowgirl Bey
At least you can get on with other stuff knowing youre not missing anything happening in the video
I have
I guess Beyonce can only walk 5 steps and shoot her pretend gun.  The rest of the world has to use some intelligence to earn money.
I just heard about this . had to see it for myself. The song is not bad ,the video is stupid . and nothing about how she's dressed says country .
Her outfit and the song horrible 😵‍💫
Só faz isso no clipe ? 😂 meta de vida ❤
Is there an actual video or is it just this intro clip? Kind of dig Beyoncé with a country feel.
😂😂😂😂😂 wow.
No lie this is an embarrassing song
Trash 🗑️ 🚮
I dont get the dislikes?
I hate this song!!
This version really sucks. Can you imagine if they had to put their talents to good use have good video this could be?
Video rubbish. Song great
Why is she naked?
Not the country fans getting mad Beyoncé is going back to her TEXAS roots🌚
Ew😖   Get clothes on  it is  not funny👇
This is such a fucking garbage. But I guess people in murica are beyond saving.
This has got to be the lamest country ever, i already hate the new stuff, this is an all time low, i see why alan Jackson walked out, this is pop music with texas being said, 90s country and under is where country was at, now its garbage
This shot won't win her album of the year. She's trying to prove a point what ever she does people will like it and she's right. But I don't like any of her new stuff for the last few albums
Let’s leave country to Morgan wallen please and thank you
The genre switch was not it 😊
Hey it’s Franklin, coming to my house, so lay your turtle shell down down down
Terrible
I really don't like this song ...Really people this is not it ...I'm sorry but really don't like it
🤢🤮...Holy s*** this was terrible.
Forget Taylor Swift. Beyonce is the definition of real music
Hated this song the first 5 times I actually like it now
Her voice is like a shiny crystal that can never be broken. Superb
Please stay out of country...
Couldn't  afford choreography
She needs to stay in her lane
Did anyone see the Gracie’s corner remix😂😂😂😂
B going Taylor and Taylor going B what is this shift😮
Beyoncé is down bad
Reminds me of Madonna’s  DONT TELL ME😳
I love Beyoncé
Can't stand her but this song is good
YES!!!🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
I have never been into country or line dancing.    I absolutely love this song and I’m ready to buy some western boots and hit a country dance hall!  Yeehaw!! 😂
terrible 🤢
Only 2 issues with this.. #1 put some clothes on #2 lose the word "bitch"
This is terrible 😂 y’all tripping
Queen B redoing Franklin love it😅
#STOPGREENSCREENKIDS AND WHY IT SO LAGGY💀
She is going to take the country to the whole world.
If I say I won't listen to her any longer what does that actually mean to a wife of a billionaire, also she's worth more money in a few minutes than most will make in a lifetime
Close your eyes and envision Franklin you'll never unsee it. Hey it's Franklin coming to play.
Wow she actually ripped off the kids tv show Franklin the fucking turtle. I guess you need to pay the Illuminati for genuine original material😂😂😂😂😂
It's the Franklin song.
Bey you did great my mom loves ur music and for all talk hating Beyoncé isn’t for everyone she’s human too(≧◡≦) ♡good job girly!
All the white people are soo mad💀💀. It’s funny how you people always forget Black people invented country music.They created that shit.
This song for me is absolutely horrible and yet it's better than anything I've ever heard Taylor Swift's make.
Toby Keith rollin over in his grave.
🤮🤮
Soy de Argentina y estoy esforzándome para colaborar con esta gran artista 🇦🇷❣
#IDK
I’m getting so annoyed by this video. Wtf
GET SOME CLOTHES ON.... THAT NOR COUNTRY!  LOOKS LIKE  BURLESQUE  LOL!
What is a visualizer??? I’m so confused 😂💀
Why does this song sound like something prisoners would sing while digging a trench with prison guards on horseback holding  rifles waiting for someone to take off running...lol
Put some clothes on.
Can’t wait for this cringey song to disappear. Makes it worse when this lady supported BLM
This ain’t country…
Make no sense
Heyyy it's Franklin !
I guess we all know who fav song is now !!!!!
This video is lame.
Awesomeness SALUTE QUEEN
Garbage ...save it for jelly roll and stay in your lane
🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉
This song is sooooo Shit !!!
Poor girl
Ela é tão criativa e dança muito, fazer um clipe com um gesto repetitivo... Deixou ou a desejar!
I'm a fan of beyonce and her music, but I'm just not feeling country Bey. I honestly feel like most people really don't like this shit that much, they're just being supportive
I just found the karaoke version and started singing the Franklin theme song....not exactly the same but it works. Lol
This is not country. And neither is she. It’s ridiculous that people think either one is true or good.
Am I the only one that noticed her shirt
Bring country back B
https://youtu.be/ioN-pT1ZxrU?si=VOvRgIeskWf3h_5u
she pretend to be Mickey Guyton
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" remains at #1 for a 2nd week on the Billboard Hot 100! Keep buying and streaming on ALL platforms! 👑🐝
Does she have to have her fake boobs on show ? Kinda ruins the song
The chorus is classic but Beyonce ruins it.
There Are Infinite Times To everyone’s everything
Reyna Robert’s is so much better
Who wrote this?  Sounds like Mickey Guyton or Alice Randall (?).
🔥🔥🔥
hello.. baby..  :)
well feed?
protect your dog!!! lol
Ngl I don’t like Beyoncé new country music stuff.
jesus come to the holly ground oh my lord the god
Just because your name is Beyonce doesn't mean you can do anything.   Stay in your lane. Country music is straight trash anyways. But this, well, let's just say this made the tippy cup song sound like Stairway to Heaven.
Imma let you finish, but Beyonce has one of the worst country songs of all time. Of all time.
She had to wear that for people to watch lol this is terrible
Maybe a f..g visualiser but it’s still released as a video - ie in the video charts at 3
I  like that it's an actual structured song. Verse, bridge, chorus. Strangley is something that is missing in music nowadays.
WTAF is a "visualizer"? How boring.
Next evil TikTok trend
Why are you ripping off a child's tv show? And why are you half naked? Doesn't anyone have common decency anymore?
I love the song but escuse me what's the point of the video repeating over and over again I imagine it different
Take it over Beyoncé. In reality, just like most popular music genres, country music in the U.S. began with Black People. More specifically, the story of country begins with the banjo. The modern-day banjo is a descendant of a West African instrument, made from gourds, called the Akonting.
Ez a klip egy forintot nem ér
Não a sigo mas esta simples canção é ótimo ❤
SHE'S BACK BABY!
Hey, it's Franklin! Coming over to play 🎵🎶
I dont consider this country at all, but i like the song.
Jesus what are we selling here? Nice boob job who’s your surgeon? To me this is  a slap in the face of country music. So you can sing country so what? Stay in your lane darling. This anin’t country!!
buddy guy   left my blues
it's a one paragraph song? there is no lyric.. so if it's not texas what is it?
ya I'm sure she wrote this all by herself.. WHAT TALENT!!
Had to think about where i had heard this riff before and then i realized that she ripped off the music from a show my kids used to watch called hey its franklin. Guess her ghost writers are getting sloppy.
Horrible
Um these visualizers tho? I don't really get it. The song is a beat all day!
What the hell is she trying to sing country, horrible representation with bad words, and that’s how mothers go out naked … wow this is not worth watching or all the hype whatsoever!
Is this a video???? Country music????
Fun song.  Shitty video.
This is not country music
Not feeling the video!
At this point, she might as well start an OnlyFans. Good grief.
still a shitty video...
Whooohooo
You know when people really have talent, they don't need to put their bits on display. Whitney Houston never did, Mariah Carey doesn't go that far, Celine Dion or Barbara Striesand..... Beyounce doesn't need to disrespect herself so much & sell herself as just a sexual object. It's bad taste & classless🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
How do her tits look so incredible lol
Good song but extremely revealing outfit and extremely monotonous video. 😮
Just no, worst Beyoncé song ever
Can real boobs look like this without support? They are looking like balloons. 🤔
Speechless and not in a good way lol
Just cuz you slap a country beat on the track doesn't mean it will be a country song when your voice is still coming through as R&B.   Also I'm annoyed that this tune is catchy af
I guess she didn’t have time to finish getting dressed!
So some stupid women stolen her e Ex boyfriend ..cash from his account threw his cell thar he was saving for his lid heart surgery..to go to your concert..
Awful
Just came to hear what itsounds like. EXIT, STAGE LEFT.....NO THANKS!
Since we all have opinions, I'll say if it weren't for her background music and/or singers...she wouldn't be who she is.  I always remove the voice and listen to the music. Try it and you'll never go back.
Who tf approved this music video??? Does not go with the music at all...
And I snore myself to sleep. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reminds me of her Swing Low Sweet Chariot singing clip..😍
😊la amo pero necesito que haga un paso texano ja
I love Beyonce. Just wishing lovely lady would dress a little conservative. Beyonce makes the grandbabies hungry with flashings beautiful milk bottles 🍼 (breast)
Heyy it's Franklin!
Ué KD o clip gente, é só isso msm?
Not going to get Album of the year  or any Grammy with this song
Shit song! Crap video… sad we are getting this pushed down our throat
Hey it’s Franklin
beyoncé is a musical genius. people are big mad over a fantastic country song.
Zero effort video
What is on her face?
This song is horrible....😢
Her personality think she just should’ve stayed in her lane with her music. This is not Beyoncé. It’s not even a cute tune. It’s stupid. This song is dumb. And the whole gun thing what are we five?
She should've stayed in the house music genre
I just came to laugh at this garbage.
Guys check out this remix of Aaron Smith - Dancin by AnOnYmO --> https://youtu.be/qswUL4-Di2s
Kein Geld für das Video?!
As someone from texas. We dont claim her. She aint Houston no more.
❤❤🎉
you amazing
Video is terrible
This is fake country.
This is fake country all y’all getting played.  So she can get cmt/cnt.   She doesn’t even know how to do an oil change yet alone don’t think she taken here cars down into a mud hole      In his isn’t country this is pop culture trying to mess with the algorithm to get views up and get the plays up.  Don’t fall for this fake shit
so beautiful 🌹
Catchy tune. BUT what oh what is she wearing? That's a real cheap look with too much skinshow. Totally unnecessary.
She could have done such a great dance to this song instead of the repetitive shooting thing. Catchy song though.
I am not a fan of country music, I am not American but I have ears and this does not sound like country, it sounds like RnB, just because there's a Banjo doesn't make it country.
Une déesse
I fuck with this song  but not that outfit
Dope song 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Well there's that
This song had flow❤ samn good groove
I hear some, 'Black horse and a cherry tree' in this song as well.
This MV is so repetitive dude but Beyoncé is a stunning lady can’t deny that. Brittany Broski can’t defend the video but the song itself?? YES MA’AM
has she ever made a good song since the pink panther song?
This song is horrible! She needs to rethink her country music career!
looking so sexy
stolen from franklin:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1dzaMCityg
Wtf.
She's an amazing artist, but personally the outfit seems un-country. Great song. Great singer, dancer and beautiful to boot. Don't like the outfit for country.
As talented as this woman is why does she always have to be half naked in videos??     Ohhh-💡  ….to get the country’s boys to watch.  I think it’s pitiful that they can’t let her song be enough.
If you think this is country music, you’re lost….
How the hell is this considered country music??? Wtf happened to this world
Its all over yt tho
First country music we’ve liked since the 80s. Looking forward to what’s next.
This song got a lotta ppl showing their Jim Crow colors
Don’t hate the song. But this video is dumb and her outfit if awful.
HEY IT'S FRANKLIN 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nobody mentioned it but what a music clip 😒 0 effort in it... i was expecting some sexy dancer somewhere in a club, with cool choreography and with Beyoncé in front of them, it's a shame that so catchy song has so lame clip... "Walk few steps and than we use it like a loop" kids in Kindergarten would do this better...
I blame u beyonce for making this song everywhere i go i hear it i wont care if it was actually a good song but its just one of those dogshit country songs that are all duplicates of each other and legitimately the worse types of songs
Why she sound just like Sara Evans?
I like the song 🎵 Question... where are her clothes?
90% of YouTube shorts now
Sometimes its good to stick to the one you know you good at! And not ruin other type of musics 😂!
Why is she dressing like Kanyes wife?
Play Beyonce love your new album and the it's a hit I just want to say and I love the first two songs off of it so give me about another 6/8 months I'll I'll give it a Platinum Plus❤
Say hello to your new lover
Love it
Disgusting!
In Foreign Urfi Javed be like 😂
I am Texan and this song is al good
Garbage
Fan of Beyonce from day 1 BUT this song is HOT GARBAGE 🔥
Fucking shit song on repeat on yt shorts
Beyoncé - Texas Hold 'em (Remix) Clean Edit (ft. Billy Ray Cyrus) https://youtu.be/J-tc4MUqGn0
Why are all the videos with this song better than the songs artist
She may be the queen of pop but definitely *NOT* country.
What does it have to do with her fake breast ?
Southern Pop that has been blessed. ✨
Why does she keep doing the same thing over and over again??? This is actually the dumbest thing I have ever seen!! You are not country but nice try! Stick with what you know
Is this the video????
Actually Country people drive pickup trucks, jeeps and other non luxury vehicles. Lexus aint no country car that a city car
Not really liking it. Not real country
Nah doesn't fit her horrible 🤦
This is not County. Your daddy is shamed if he knew anything about real deep south country.
WTF does this video have to do with anything?
this is not country
Ate slayy
This isn't country
I like a lot about this Duchess Byoncé song about Texas!! I will listen more times again!!
Like this style !!
SMH I Hate this song but I like country music
Are we not gonna talk about she barley has clothes on?💀
Just a cash gra b and theres also knockoff rihanna wardrobe
Foul mouth
Put some damn clothes on
Pretty fuckibg lame… especially for a famous female GAR
#Beyoncé ! No The Town [ São Paulo - 2025 ] Brasil !
You have officially been awarded the “ Most boring music video “ award.
Muy buena canción...pésimo video muuuuuy aburrido... están mejor los tic toc que hace de esta canción 😊
What's it like to be that beautiful and talented? It doesn't matter if she's "not a country singer." Have you heard of crossover hits? It's a catchy song. Forget who she is. If it's a good song, what difference does it make?

For you racists out there, know that the foundation of country music is that infectious African banjo! Now that you know, are you against the banjo in “your” music?
Why does She have to be half naked all the time🙄
K I see it this is a good song but I swear every single place I go I hear this song and it’s actual starting to get on my fucking nerves like bro stop this is getting annoying for me cuz I keep hearing it to me I feel like it’s not even that good anymore (in my opinion)
Genial. Bey parece que está fazendo um arco sobre a cultura do país dela. O povo negro dos EUA viveu especialmente nesses estados do sul.
Quick! Someone call Lemay, tell them to get this trash out of here.
Beautiful! Relax and enjoy the music! You look foolish with all that racism preventing you from simply enjoying beautiful music.
This is the dumbest video I have ever seen 😂😂😂 What is the point!
Wth is this??? No no
This is what happens when you sell your soul to Nashville.
So much talent. Why does she have to be naked?
I was in a coma and I woke up just to turn this shit off. Thank you queen bee
Y all the hate...it's the #1 song on all charts. She was born in Texas. She has more money than God and wanted to try something different.  Dolly Parton has succeeded in country, rock, pop, gospel and business... Taylor swift started in country  and moved to pop. Not fond of the video but the woman can damn sing in any music style
The banjo player, Miss Rhiannon Giddens, is 🔥!!
For her next tour, Im buying tickets in Houston instead!  I wanna feel this hit hard in her hometown!!!  They always get the best performances also!
She already rhymed Texas w Lexus in Kitty Kat...Im just saying...16 Carriages should be #1 w how emotional it hits!!a
This doesnt have the palpable emotional shock & vulnerability like 16 Carriages does!  How is this #1?? Listen to 16 Carriages please!!!
Is she supposed to be the terminator?
Absolute garbage! You want country? Waylon Jennings is country!
For yall complaining about the short visual replaying, isnt this better than just words on the screen?  She cant make anyone happy!
I have to say this is the only Beyoncé song I like, I’m age 68. Not crazy about the visualization. It’s all sexual when it comes Beyoncé. What a shame because her voice sells her music.
This sounds like something that would be on a Disney/Pixar movie. The montage scene.
So, i must have not heard some of the music biz new lingo. This video is a Visualizer. So, basicly a short loop just to run the music too. No big budget, just background thingy. OK..I think I get it. They could just about AI herand she not even show up for a loop shoot. Saves $$$$
$5 footlong cost like $13 now and Beyoncé makes country music. The world is fuckin over.
Wow… what a video
Bro that top is just nasty like bro
Ik
With that outfit, I almost forgot about the song.
That's a nice left eye piece you have in the song and that's a nice left hand finger gun you got no she doesn't know anything that other people don't know not at all
My left handed queen I remember next time I put choose a mate to pick a left-hander not a right-hander
neat song, BORING video
WHERE are her clothes!??!…. Now hollywood/celebs are corrupting country
Great video🙄
Why does she look like a cyborg?? THIS is NOT. Country!!!
This is a dumbest video I’ve ever seen
Why doesn’t this itch stay in her lane..no one wants to see her do this
Por culpa sua tô viciado nessa música izabelleeeee 😭😭😭
Trash
I love the whole vibe🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This the official video?? Really
My daughter says the video is wack 😅
Garbage
This is great, I think it is her best song. Love her voice now sounds better now it's matured.
Sorry, it’s not country. Neither is the outfit. Real country singers know their talent will carry the song; they don’t need to rely on shock value costumes. You could have done so much better than this.
😂
THEY COULDN'T FIND A VEST THAT WOULD FIT HER?
60% song 40% nudity
It's not a bad song and Beyonce is obviously talented as hell but this is pop music not country
Boogie
I don’t know why this is so fucking good
Song is ass 😂😂😂😂😂
Beyonce gained what 50 pounds and whats up with this low budget video ?
This isn’t county music. But it is catchy.
Que vieja tan mas grosera yo no se por que permiten eso y en especial enseñando quien sabe que cosa😡😡😡
I dont like it but won't say it won't grow on me. I want some twang in my country music
Eh nah she needs to stop
No entendí este video repetitivo de lo mismo, la canción buena, el vídeo muy malo
I’m so tired of hearing his song
This isn't any type of video I have ever seen for a Country song. Let's see her line dance like all the people on yout
I hope Franklin is getting Royalties for this she done stole this from his theme song
I love this. I really think this should be on every country channel. She is so diverse. All her music is great. I absolutely love " old country but I love all the " new country ". We should hang on to the past but also embrace the future.
She’s showing way too much skin
Where Close
Are we all gonna ignore the eye candy?
Not really much of a creative video, is it?
❤🙏
Worst video ever
Love it but sounds a lot  like Lebanon JSOndara which I also love
This isn't real country...me personally this is trash
Cute song! Nice to line dance to.  ❤
What is this... The Voices are getting louder... This is everywhere... This is enough make it stop... It haunts me it doesn't want to leave...  Why is my shorts filled with these... Shorts, tik tok, you made me come here... Make this pain end...
Meeeeehhhhh 🙄
Bey so amazing 🥹👑
This Franklin's theme song
Such a coincidence that the queen made this song with all that's now Goin on with Texas
I just came here to say I hate this song and I cant wait for it to disappear into the background. I am sick of repeatedly singing it in my head and it sucks.
Woman empowered song 🎶 ❤❤❤❤😉🫶🏻 ❤️🤍💙🤎🖤 Love this 😅
As a Texan, what in the fuck is this
People keep listening to this crap it will be accepted and no county fan wants that ahhhh move on woman
Trash...
I HATE THIS SONG
Put some clothes on 🤦🏼‍♀️
Theme music for  the turtle 🐢 “Franklin”
Nice light porn - love it
Beautiful! Return to form…GO MS. B!
If i hear this one more time
I love your  song  it ateeee𖠺
Song is trash and a desperate move to get a country audience she is not a country singer
Pathetic video..... Our CW singers wear clothes.  They don't have to be gimmicky and naked to sing!!!  She needs to stay with the genre that doesn't mind being naked to sing.
So I finally heard this Right now. This is Considered Country? Hmmm interesting
Niceness
🥱🥱🥱
Please for the love of every holy continue to make country music, and songs like this one!
Ridiculous 😂
All my brothers are in the jail the  neighborhood is in homicide emergency and I Left my blues like a rock
Der Song ist echt geil, aber ihr Outfit passt ni
Porq salió desnuda???  🤦‍♀️😿😔
If all I wanted to see is boobs hanging out and not a country hit, noclue what to call it but it sucks!
Wtf is this shit 😂
Make a proper vid for this queen Bee!
Good song, she looks revolting
This song is corny af. She’s over hyped 🤦‍♀️
This song sucks
Where did the trend dance on tiktok came from then!
Stupidest waste of time to watch. She’ll do anything to stay in the spotlight
🐄Work in the field ?
She is not country at all she is a wanna be country singer
i liked the song. the video doesn't go along with the song. imo no one needs to get have naked.
Vidéo clips aucun rapport avec la chanson 🤦‍♀️
Kinda cute catchy rythym but not country.
Rubbish!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥰👏👏👏👏
I cant get this song out of me head
That is the worst attempt to crossover video I have ever seen ! Ridiculous ! Same thing over and over. Stay in your own lane lady.
The black taylor swift
I don't really like Beyonce I don't really like country But this works for me.
Nasty
Guess they believe the phrase “sex sells” and had no confidence in the song’s appeal to have her dressed like that…love the tune…
Beyonce ain't selling music & lyrics, or she woulda come on, with clothes On. She doesn't have much respect for herself, so folks will reply in like kind... She looks like a real sweet hoeing gal  to me...
This ain’t country, but it’s a catchy tune.
Por q sera q eu esperava um clipe estilo country
She ain't never done anything for Houston much less heard about her in Texas she can stay up in NYC song sucks!
Is not her body the upper is more white of rest
Cannot make head or tail out of this song. I hope this does not become like the anthem of Texas, and we have to listen to it everywhere years to come. I love Beyonce, but this song??? Not so sure.
White lives matter
Nope 👎🏻
Love her to
I wish she was doing a little more.
This is awful y’all wtf
Y’all play too much, this is fucking garbage 😂😂😂
Crap!
Uhm no. Sorry. This ain't it AT ALL!
Can't understand the the lyrics, this IS NOT REAL COUNTRY, terrible! I'll take Shania Twain anyday over this garbage! thanks anyway for trying. You've gotta get nude and show off your body when there's no real talent. This happens when the music industry is weaponized by the government to convey a message through entertainment.
put a shirt on 😭
Now I know why we only hear one part of this song in tiktok clips. Besides the chorus, this song sucks.
Love this song so much but the video for it sucks.
OMG!!!
Well, that sucked. Including the video. Sounds like Harold the Turtles theme song.
They are doing one thing over many times
PUT SOME FUCKING CLOVES ON
😯😯😍😍
Waste of 4 minutes of my life.
Tune
Never heard a " country" song that sounded like shit!!! Stick with music you know!!!
I like the song. The video is a bit lacking, so to speak. Is this really the official video? She walks towards the camera, does a bang bang and that's it? Loop a 12 second thing twenty-five times? Anyway, I agree that it sounds just like Franklin's theme too.
اول عربي هنا 😓😂
This is the stupidest video and song ever. Too slutty for country. You.cant even understand what she's saying. Country songs are real life experiences you feel the music come alive inside you it takes you to that place in time.  This is just pathetic.
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡
No.1 lets go
This ain’t Franklin
This is not a country song, I have listened to country music since 1970 and I know country and a real country singer would not ware something like this but the new supposedly country singers does not know how to dress either.
This is legitimately the Franklin theme song 🎵 y'all don't believe me go check nice try Beyonce 🐢
I’m so bored with these vulgar artists, like dude you aren’t a novelty, just put a fucking blouse on. You have a hot body, we got it 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Not really country, more like pop in my opinion....
Is she forgetting that children look at her? So sad.
Ok I'm not mad at this song. Great job Beyonce!!!
Man they got lazy with this video.
Someone forgot her blouse and pants 🥴😏
Her outfit💀☠️
Cant u make a song of were u t-shirt is
Here comes Franklin! 🐢🐢🐢
Stick to pop/R&B..
She’s so so beautiful wow 😍
So much to see. I’m impressed.
Very catchy. Country isn’t really my style of music, I like some country songs but a lot I don’t really like. But I actually enjoy this. It’s calming, peaceful, and reminds me of a cozy rainy day. Not a bad song!
I think Franklin could probably win that lawsuit
Franklin theme song!! 😂
Lol stick with your kind of music
What does that outfit have to do with Country,  she ain’t country either .
Um no. Just no.
I smell Franklin theme song
She needs to put on a top gawd! Seriously gross.
Don't like this, but give me George Strait and Merle Haggard any day of the week.
Amazing.  She's so talented and truly blessed. 💗
That beat is the Franklin intro from the cartoon
Lamest music video ever. Beyonce, you're not that special.
When your career stales you either go christian or country. What up Darius!
I'm not happy with this video love the song but she selling out
I'm not happy with this video love the song but she not doing it for me.
Beyoncé needs to STAY IN HER LANE….she’s NOT A COUNTRY MUSIC SINGER, it’s not in her blood. Dressed so SLUTY!!! Total DISRESPECT TO COUNTRY MUSIC. 😡😡😡😡
THIS IS THE FRANKLIN THEME SONG
I just love how the country music listeners don't count this as real country 😂😂😂
This is the type of song that people think of when they make fun of country music. She literally says hoedown 😆 so horrible
Sorry, she is not on any country charts.
Ok I really do like the song and think it’s going to be a lot of fun to dance to but this video is a big NOPE come on girl you got more to you than this . 😑
Meh.. it’s ok. Not a big fan of it, sounds like Franklin like everyone says, it also has a bad cheesy country music taste. Strange to hear her voice in country though.
Bro where’s her shirt and pants😮she’s have naked
Hey its Franklin ❤
This song just isn’t good nor is it country
Might as well just unleash those warlocks.
What a creative video. Seems so much thought went into it.😆
Why is nobody talking about the fact that there is only one shot that is been repeated throughout the video
How is this not cultural appropriation?  I know Beyoncé and Jay Z are RACISTS but where’s the outcry from the public?
This is terrible
Wtf is this piece of shit?
You ain't no tay-tay, stay in your lane....
This is so bad 😬
This is the most trash ass county song and I’m from Texas. Don’t disrespect Texans
Love It💜💜
I don’t know what worst the song or the video
CHÚC MỪNG CHỊ ĐẠP VÀO TAYLOR XUỐNG THÀNH CÔNG🎉
How is this country? Where are the fiddles ? Where is the steel guitar? It isn't very good at all
Did she go to country because Taylor Swift came back to pop? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The most disgusting country video I've ever seen. The most disgusting country lyrics I've ever heard.
When did Beyonce become queen of country music. She really isn't if you have a high pitched voice, then you're not meant for country.😂❤
Would fit in red dead redemption between chapter 1 and 2
It would never ever be a true to form music video from no other than Beyonce without her showing a good percentage of breasts!! 😮
Not county
Radio stations have to play this song this vibe this song just gives you a chilled feeling
What a terrible song
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared  What the Fuck……
Me in my head: let’s watch this it will probably have some action  Me out loud: bro pls put a shirt on all your doing is standing there 😫🥹😭 My mom: I love this song Me: I hate it!!! In my room: THIS ANIT TEXAS AHH   I worked hard on this comment pls give me some likes I did like my own comment 😅
this song just unleashed a new era of buckle bunnies.
Did she really rip off the Franklin theme song
Didn’t know Beyoncé was a fan of rdr2, I think blud does not have a. Plan
Garbage
I love. The song but the video
THIS SONG IS FIRE 🔥 KEEP IT BURNING 🗣️
Y'all know Beyonce can sang Country and Western. She's from Houston, Texas. 🤠
What. A. Boring. Video. Fab song thought..
I’m in Texas and 0:43  is the most relatable thing *ever*
She just took lines from other people's songs and put them together. Trash!
So gay this is some bullshit this is like a little kids song. Such dog shit
This ain't country. Sounds like a jingle for a commercial or the Franklin theme song
Nice song. Why dressed like that...
Eh leave country to the real ones please I don't really listen to it but they sound great when I hear this so called country it isn't tho
Even haters must respect my fellow Virgo sister's enormous TALENT!!! As a Virgo its hard for me to be free with my creativity because I am very sensative to judgment. Super brave and creative!❤
Confused why we did the same dance moves the whole time
I just kept waiting for the song to get good😂 such a disappointment
Man, Franklin really stepping it up for their new series.
As a black man in my mid-50s who grew up on R&B and hip-hop, I absolutely love this song!
Girl this song is my new favorite song ❤❤❤❤😊
I love this song!!  Congratulations on your album!!  ❤❤❤❤😎😎
My teacher is actually called mrs. Bley so we all call Bleyonce  But I just love this song. ❤️
That ain't country. 🇨🇱
Beyonce needs to stay in her own lane country isn't her thing I guess she wasn't making enough money in her scene.
Listened to the first 20 seconds and sounds good. I just don’t understand why Beyoncé has to wear an outfit like this so I stopped watching. Gorgeous lady, but she’s big enough she doesn’t have to wear something that revealing
I swear if I hear this song one more time I’m gonna break my phone
Bunch of shit like most the billboard is...
This song is basically for the white people to dance on TikTok or cringy white people bars
You do you girl but to call this country music is a bit of a leap.  "Urban bluegrass"
No.
My shorts is full of this shit and I'm super pissed
🤤🤤🤤
This is the dumbest music video I ever seen
This is a joke right. This ant country.
She still needs clickbait and nudity after all that success.
Franklin theme song
This is the most average song ever created.  It's very telling that she relied on softcore porn to sell it.
I like this song and Beyonce❤
This song is not for kids 😂
Sooooo good 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Garbage
That's no country basically nude just to gain something in what way 👎
Beautiful body
Wow,  gee. Hard to figure out the symbolism behind this get up.   Hmm I WONDER what one eyed covered by a snake could mean? 😅
I don’t understand this video !
Visually boring video.
It’s not country. Sounds like she has a cold. Choo 🤧
Damn sounds like Franklin lmao
Proud native Houstonian here!!! Bey is a true Houston, TX mega star 🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🎉🎉🎉
No wonder she didnt win album of the year.  Write shitty music win shitty music prizes.  Stop blaming other people for your shortcomings.  And this video just exemplifies the lack of fkn talent as well.  Jesus christ
I hope she does more country she does amazing work with country
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How did this video get 12 million views. She can make money just with this .
Franklin! Lol
We created all music lol and it shows folks hate to be out done nighty night haters
It has country undertones but it’s more like pop.
I love Texas and new York 😊I live in texas
She could have done so much with this video.
It is so so good. Totally loved it. Love Beyonce.
Okay , she made it to top of the charts . But  it took public love for this song . They'll be no recognition from her hubby or YA 😅
Toni Black 3-3-24 love ❤️ all of you ♥️ ❤️
Anyone here after listening to the Franklin the turtle theme song?
My 80 year old mother is the biggest Beyoncé fan and loves country music. So she’s loving this!!
secara ngga langsung mbak ini mengakui dajjal ada kan ya? 😅
MEMELER ŞAKAMI
TEXAS
Song is ass
I admire modern pop stars position. They know they're mediocre, as well as their "music", so theu try to attract with their music at least perverts.
I love you Beyonce,❤
How is this song#1 in country . The music people are into these days is a joke
Must be getting tired all she does is walk and and stand when usually she dances her ass off and then some.❤
She makes country pop.
The shits a loop
The song is very good, but Beyoncé's video is simply ridiculous! 🤣🤣🤣
Probably the worst video I've ever seen 😢
Franklin's theme song. Same but different words. And she's literally singing like she usually does. Just a country bear.
This video was almost satanic
✨️❤️😘😍
MARAVILHOSA ❤👏🏽
Ain't her breast suppose to be saggy at her age? Jay Z mess with it so many times in so many years it suppose to be saggy at this point. Since they're rich they must of been inflated for videos purposes.
الله لا يبلانا وش ذا اللبس
Not my kinda music 👎
これは本当に公式の動画なの？
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 what an artard
Gosh no video can be watched with kids
Why wear any clothes at all?
They should just gimme back my trillions if they think its too risky to change me back to girl. Change my heart, intestines and genitals and skin
The police are calling me the tenor. Which I find aggravating because I a girl Damascus
When am I going to get some support 😪
I don't appreciate so much boob, but the song is good.
🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒😋
I like it and I don’t usually listen to country.
I thought it would atleast be like the dance but no it's 1 vid on reply
Clever. Simple lyrics and song - not unlike Faith by George Michael. Uncomplicated, catchy & relatable across many genres = worldwide hit!
SEM ORÇAMENTO PARA O VÍDEO CLIP ?
Very porn?
Beyonce make sure you dont accidently flash somone
Beyonce really went from cvnty to country 💀
I'm sorry but this video is not right,I like song but now I don't after seeing this, seriously??😂
Maybe she should have square-danced. I don’t get the video
Bet she didn't write it.
Aren't you embarrassed for listening to such crap?
Slay honey
Canción para el mercado USA, no sé si se enterará en otros países , en España no
This video is absolutely stupid 💔💔💔💔💔
What kind of garbage is this bro?? Country music gone to the ground
The outfit💀💀💀
Son and mother in married
Najlepsze z tego wszystkiego są CYCKI
This isn’t country - hell, it isn’t even talent!
Proud of you for doing ivy park. Maybe you should downsize it and buy a flag ship store in L.A just sell it from one store in America. Throw a couple of celebs on special occasions and launchs to meet and greet in the store xx
Isn't this the intro to Franklin? 👀👀
Ben Shapiro rapping and Beyonce doing country? I'm turning in my bingo card now cause I'm not winning.
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya Girl, what you thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya These men don't want no hot female that's Been around the block female, you nasty girl
Worst song
People like this shit?

Ich mag eigentlich keine Countrymusic , aber der Song ist einfach genial ❤❤
I'm so bored with waiting. Everyone is so slow at fixing my health and skin, teeth and gentials
This song is a bit repetitive, showing unneccessary skin, and a bit confusing.  I say confusing because of the title. Could someone help me understand? (I am geniunely asking and hoping to get an snwer.)
My 13 year old daughter loves country music…I’m fine if she wants to “try” to break into it but put some F-ing clothes on!!! Kids are watching. Seriously do better if you’re coming over to country!
Definitely a "Ho" down
Why is the video just her doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?
Don’t think this is county music - its still a futuristic fast paced song with different instruments.
Ive never had much of an opinion on Beyonce but wow this is fun. And if this isnt country I dont know what is. Its a good mix of the 2000s girlboss pop country and the 2010s stomp hey era (one genre i loathed and one i loved).
Love it!! You go girl!!
Lmao straight stole Franklin the turtles 🐢 song that’s jay z and Beyoncé for you 💀
It’s ass
Like the song but video is so boring.
SMH! Terrible
Wth is a visualizer
You can take the girl out of Texas,  But you can't take the Texas out of the girl Rock On Queen B!
Easiest video ever.
what a fucking disgrace
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over ?
BEYONCE IS NOT COUNTRY! SHE IS POP AT BEST! THERE IS ONLY 2 GOOD BLACK COUNTRY MUSIC ARTISTS AND BEYONCE IS NOT ONE OF THEM! IM SICK OF HEARING THAT SHES A GOOD COUNTRY SINGER! THIS SONG ISNT EVEN GOOD! YOU WANNA HEAR A GOOD BLACK COUNTRY SINGER?! DARIUS RUCKER OR SECOND CHANCE. LISTEN TO ACTUAL GOOD BLACK COUNTRY SINGERS
Such a good song and the video sucks.
Hey❤
This is one of the stupidest, most annoying songs in a while
This is bad music.
What is going on
This is the dumbest video I have ever seen!!
What is this garbage video? Nice mask.
To all the Franklin commentators: HA HA HA!  FUNNY!!!!  But, maybe love this song even more!
I dunno… I liked her clips better when she took time to hire a choreographer an’ all… 🤭💋
Great, more shitty pop country and franklin?
If you are from Texas, literally like none of this is true. WE’RE NOT EVEN IN TORNADO VALLEY ANYMORE
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY!!!
Okkk howdy 🤠 folks💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I like the music but not a big fan of how she is dressed. 😊
In honor of releasing country music...Beyonce turned herself into a White person. 👱‍♀️ HOW CUTE!!
This is not real country music go listen to Luke Combs or somebody like that not this
Not country at all
How is she white now?
What a s***** video
First new song I've loved in ages. Beyonce' has re-imagined country music.
SHOUT OUT TO THE D BAR.........3RD WARD TEXAS........HTOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....MUCH LUV YONSAY......1 OF A KIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE YOU.........I'M LAYING MY CARDS DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....LOL......SHOUT OUT TO BABY BLUE....
Wow. This is garbage. Wish I hadn't bothered
Song played 6 times IN A ROW on my yt shorts
This song is trash 🗑️
She need a shirt or crop top
This reminds me of my cousin
Its ok
If she shook her titties I might have believed her really!
Country music fans should embrace the fact that she is bring attention to their genre, since hip-hop and r&b are global while country music restricted to the U.S.
Some one tell jayz his wife does even belong in this category. And this song is absolutely  horrible!!!!!!!
I’m fucking done…😂😂😂😂😂
This aint real country
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Taylor swift goes from country to pop Queen B goes from pop to country.   Fair trade.
As a Texan, I agree with this message.
Good job she literally ripped off a childrens song and comes out halfnaked
This songs over played & trash. Beyoncé you are not from the country 😂😂 probably never been
DON'T COME ME IN THE COMMENTS BUT.......THE WRITER OF THE SONG " HEY IT FRANKLIN " IS THINKING OF SUE HER BECAUSE MELODY IS SIMILAR TO HIS. LISTEN HIS SONG AND HERS AND DECIDED FOR YOURSELF.
This is NOT country. It’s not wholesome. It’s not family friendly.
This is not good
Just, no.
This is not country music its more like pop country it repeated alot
Stay the fuck out of our music
Puke
Is anyone else noticing that the music video is strange and slight inappropriate
Stop stealing our culture
❤❤❤
This aint country music just because you put a beat behind a damn song dont make it country people actually live to make real country music im a texan and listen to all genres of music this is not music this is a damn mistake
Is this really a something???
All of a sudden this shit is ass. I’m just here to comment that byeee liberal be mad 😄
🥴🤢🤮🤒🤕💩☠️💀👎🏻🥥🧄
Correct. This isn’t Texas, cause you’re using a finger gun 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Came here to say i hate this song and am tired of it
THIS SONG SUCKS...SO DOES SHE
that’s the most boring redundant thing i’ve seen in a bit
Disgusting.
Now that she is withe she try’s to make whites music
How the fuck is this country?
This is pure garbage makes me want to puke
WTF is this garbage?!
I don't know what people bitchin' 'bout. This is good.
I’m not country music fan.but this song made me fan ❤❤❤
This shit sound horrible 😢
Tbh shit is flame gas
This is trash lol
Nope.  Not country music.
What the fuck is this video? It looks wrong... So wrong. So ..... I hate this industry. Despise it. Despise them all.
Awful
Couldn’t win album of the year, so she went country 😂
Pointless video it’s just the same thing over and over again
This ain’t country
I love the song but this music video is awful
the fuck is this video? lmfao
Ive been watching YouTube  and i see this song everywhere ❤❤❤❤
I'm a kuntry fan Now  I ❤️  it. Bout to go get me some cowboy boots
This song sounds like something you would hear in a tourism commercial 😂
1st, where are her clothes? She's from Texas. She should know what country music is. This is a horrible job!!!
guess country is the it girl right now lol. From post to lil nas x
I feel this is an attack on Taylor Swift
Cover your breast.   This is the example you want to be for your children.
Let's just  no notice  the people  in the back
It's not country
Doesn't sound or look country
Wish carolina chocolate drops country girl song get recognition.  They were real country.... before it was cool. To become country.  Rhiannon is so good........
Sorry Beyonce , lyrics, beat , banjo all great, the song rocks, until we get to the visuals. Why look like street walker/ slut?  Was it necessary ?  Thank God you didn't twerk to it.
LMFAO! Is this a joke?  How does dressing like a hooker and singing awful make this a country song.  You can throw this crap over into the R&B section. 😂😂😂
Well.... she tried... so thats.... something
Very soulful, i can hear the talent
I hate it
It's not bad but it ain't country
back to black 😛
I like this song! Give respect to the versatility of Beyonce!😊
I’m not a fan . Doesn’t even sound country to me.
Dont care about her or this song. I hope franklin sues for his cut 😂
Some one get her a shirt
N gostei muito dela se exibir desse geito mas a música tem uma boa batida
Uh this is “Hey It’s Franklin”
I am so sick of this song!  Please fade to oblivion, soon!  Over played and cringeworthy and everyone has to dance to it.  I do like Beyoncé's outfit though.
Oh yeah that’s amazing I mean what a roll model for these young girls to learn how to dress like an act like. I mean really, where’d you get this inappropriate idea from? Epstein island!🖕🏿😡
Beyoncé in her ✨country✨ era
All of a sudden I like a Beyoncé 's song 😅
Maravilhosa
Darius says "good job!" Lol
She doesn't have the voice for country music and she needs to put some clothes on.
How did I come up with avicii😭
Government is just trying to infiltrate our culture like they did to the blacks. Resist and ridicule.
Adoseofbuckley brought me
I wonder who she is talking about it sounds highly unrealistic 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm suddenly a country music lover... Thanks Bey ❤
The choreography just don't do it for me.  The only substance is her wearing her seamed nylons on backwards and I dig the look just wished there was a bit more like some dancers .  I can't tell ya how many in my generation use to make that hand signa at red lights! 😅 Lord Bless the 80s 🎉
I honestly dont get the hype around this song.. Sheep gotta sheep.
This song is bad what even. Terrible music.
Beyoncéeeeeeee🎉🎉🎉🎉
Love us our country music 666😈😈😈🏳️‍🌈💯
Trashy like all of her stuff. Just goes to show that she knows nothing about what country music is all about.
J'aime beaucoup la chanson, mais la tenue c'est pour quoi 😭
Kenapa video klip nya itu itu saja
She stole the Franklin and Friends song to make this? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stay in your lane!
This song deserved a completely different video… Beyoncé breaking free would have been wonderful.
I really love country ... but sorry this one isn't for me..... i can't understand the hype
Don't need you hip hop nor R&B peeps coming over to corrupt country music  don't need all that sexual ecliptic evil music
😢 Not impressed 😢
No matter where I go, I still hear this song
Theson is great! The freakin video is JUST WRONG!!
Love it!
This song is flawed: "So park your Lexus (woo) and throw your keys up (hey)"  The majority of Texans 🤠 drive trucks, not Lexus vehicles. There are 4.2 million pickup trucks in Texas and counting. The lyrics should have said: "So park your *pickup* (woo) and throw your keys up (hey)"
Tbh I’m a fan of country…this isn’t real country. (Not trying to hate or anything just doesn’t sound like country to me)
Can't tell what is worse, the song or the "music video"
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Beyonce creating a country song out of nowhere and it being the best speaks of the ease of what it takes to make country music and the skills Beyonce has to a degree
Am country music fan but this one lacks village style idk 🤷‍♀️
Here by my grill Candace lol
I’m can’t stop laughing 😂 cause bruh whattttttt
Release Date 2017-01-06 Which Is January 6, 2017
Where are her clothes she at least a cowboy hat 😂😂😂
Why is she half naked.
This fucking sucks
not much of a video.
This song belongs in the 🗑
She gives country music a bad name! Damn this song sucks and the video sucks harder!
Not country ! Thats why non country music listeners like it .  Not country in 2024!
I HATE country music, but Boyence changed that ❤
You've gotta be kidding.  So, you finally come up with a semi decent song, and this is the best video you could come up with?  You doing the same lame shit over and over again for three minutes?  That's it?  And you thought that was great?  You are capable of so much better.
This is awful and this video clip on repeat is so cringe. Gonna go watch Franklin. 🤢
This ain’t country
You missed what county is. What you sing here is not believe able. It just sounds forced. Not a fan!
STOP INVADING!!! Ok I’m not tryna be that country music boomer here. I can’t stand much pop but I do like a little rap. But I understand that millions of fans do love pop and rap. Dear pop fans and pop musicians, I would like to kindly direct you back to pop music radio. I would also kindly ask that you please STOP TRYNA INVADE AND CONQUER MY MUSIC!!! You like pop go listen to pop. I like country, but I can’t listen to country without hearing pop. I’m just so sick of it. The whole reason we have genres is so that we can find what we like and listen to what we want. And yea it’s “breaking barriers” when artists cross over, but all blurring genre lines does it makes it harder to find the music you really want and it destroys the far corners of every genre. The actual artists that is. The country musicians who are pushing the genre to new and heartfelt places are getting blocked out by pop artists who are just tryna make a splash on country radio to make a quick buck. Make no bones abt it Beyonce will never make another country album. She has no respect for the genre this is all abt cash and image. Country music is just playing dress up for these pop artists. When it comes to blocking out actual art, the same could be said for rap. The actual rappers who are pushing the limits of their art form are getting blocked out by drake and doja cat. Music is just morphing into one mono genre. Where everything is all the same. Do you want that? I don’t. Bottom line this is horrible for music and horrible for art. Even if u like the song. It’s just bad for everyone who isn’t Beyonce. Btw the song sucks.
Knock off to Billy Ray Cyrus Old Town Road
Garbage country😢lol
I'm not a Beyonce  fan AT ALL... However, I support this endeavor  because she's taking it back to our roots as black folks  Kudos to her!❤😊
I don't understand what the naked woman is doing
Sounds like the frankiln theme song search it up yall  👇 who looked it up.???
Where close 😂 this so weird
Yee-haw, but needs a steel guitar to help make it more authentic country.
oh yeah 🇮🇶
This is not country and she is nasty as always. Country musiains, don't dress like scants either. That;s a lot of peoples opinions.
Es mentira lo que dije es una broma😂❤❤❤❤
Los odio 😡
catchy but too repetitive and this is pop country at best! still, can't wait for the video...
Bravo is there anything she can't accomplish country Song  never seen it coming what  a damn Huge hit I see coming
This is an annoying song
This shit garbage
This isn't very great. I thought they said she was doing country, and this shows up. This is NOT Country music.
Rute de castro que saudades ❤️🇵🇹
You will never be country.
This isn’t even country music this is a disgrace to. Country music u she need to stick to whatever she does and leave country music alone
Yep wasn't a country fan before and this made me even less of a fan if that's even possible lol
Beyoncé there is nothing in the in the video, except for the same thing going on and on
The video is so bad 😢
I’m signing this song everyday!
This isn’t country music
When did it become normal to wear that shit. Children watch this. 😂😂😂😂
Tanner sounds better! Move over beyich😂 peace
Ate this up
“Hey you know that one country singer?” “Beyonce?” “Yeah!”
L❤VE THIS TUNE 🎵 BEYONCÉ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ HEADING OVER TO iTUNES NOW
she’s basically topless as well .   it’s just a joke on the cointry values she’s not going to dance around like those fools right ?
Just because there’s a banjo, doesn’t make it country.
No offense put a braw on it’s Cinda inappropriate
this is a joke on red necks -   it’s not country .  it’s why she’s not moving in the video .   they are laughing at insta gram and tic toc -
Eu amo 😍💖 você 🫵💝 até que quero casa com você 💕💕🫵
She is a good singer but this ain’t good. Country ain’t her thing
This isn’t country music this is California wannabe country music
Hey, it's Franklin.  👇
Queen B we love u Awesome keep up the great things ur doing being a black women down her in fFla I love it ea❤❤❤❤❤
It's a shame somebody had to sell their body to sell their music. Disgusting, but I'm sure some people will like it.
No talent
This is WHACK
Fuckin terrible
This absolutely sucks
Não gostei da vulgaridade...
Meow
It does very little for me 😮
It does very little for me 😮
WHAT IS THIS😂😂😂😂😂 Beyoncé, this is not it. Omg I cringed 😂😂 bring back destiny’s child type stuff, not this😂😂😂😂
What a weird video. Great song. Would loved to see her dancing not just her tits
Eres muy genial Beyoncé
Ok so as a country boy...can anyone tell me what this song is about? I mean i heard it and went back and read the lyrics and it kinda reads like a Joe Biden speech. Tornado touchin down...heat wave comin too hot to think straight too cold to panic..
Yooooo my Shid
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now surpassed 100 million streams on Spotify! Not only is this her fastest song to reach this milestone, its now the fastest country song to as well! 👑🐝
The song is good. The music video not so much.
Stupid ass song
I Love this song ❤️ 2:21     edit that was l𝐨𝐰𝐝 1:23
Mainstream artists should make more country songs, glad the queen did
Just because there is banjo strums doesn’t make it a country song stills like r&b to me
This is not country lol. Singing about Texas doesn't make you a country artist. Sit back down Beyonce.
I don’t understand the video
cool its a fun song it reminds me of dolly Parton
Bruh this song absolutely sucks
how is this country? pouring syrup on shit don't make it pancakes.
Stupidest video in the world! Beyonce' is too much of a lady to dress like that and the look doesn't go with country music.
I hate this song
And yet again, to the TOP!
Wow deaperate to win a Grammy, watch Taylor Swift do an RnB album and win best album, notice the token illuminati one eye symbol, ffs we know you worship the devil
I LOVE this!!! ❤❤❤
That’s Cultural Appropriation Beyoncé! Stay in your lane   Nahhh I just playin, do your thing girl!  That’s was for the Karen’s in college who get mad about white people doing black face
illumanti white house ho
Really is there a reason why she is almost naked just to try to promote a song it's really bad when artists do this just to gain attention
Goin BACK 2 her Roots eh?? TEXAS ❤❤❤❤❤
Howdy  🤠🐄 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ I'll be dammmm this song is dope 🔥🔥🔥
not for me...doesn't sound country
This guy sounds like such an old head , annoying af
This is a joke. Maybe she’ll win an award next year!!😂😂
❤❤❤
I'm not into country and this isn't county at all. Loop a country sound and skank out for the video, while wearing a fake country hat. Stay in your lane.
As someone who is actually country I can't stand this trend lady probably hasn't even seen a field yuppies don't associate your self with my culture  you will ruin it
Wake up people
Well that was dull as dishwater.
I love this country Song
Ok, imma be positive.... She's pretty. The song is uhhh...cute.
Yee Haaaaaawwwww!!!..
Turns out country music was never about the music. It was about the institutional racism.
This song is cringe!!!!
Cool. Good to see her still jamming but where did her clothes go? Gaaawd Lee 😂
Leave country music to real country singers
This bs ain't country
THIS IS NOT COUNTY  .....THIS IS POP      AND SHE IS A    POP WH&^%
Seems country enough to me!
Why does everybody like her? I don't know why
Disgusting
The music itself is okay, but the actual video is horrible! I couldn't even make it halfway through.
Sitting with losers
Ya im done with winning in blackjack
Him too
Tell your boo
B o
The Father likes women burning their fat
No beer yeast belly
This isn’t country
Nice abs
Ya no pop and drops
This rocks! Country or not!!
You have hoots pinned
This song is way to generic  and sounds just like any bubble gum country music they play now days.  I'm willing bet if she song about some of her life experiences with some simple older country sounds it might be a homerun. Just my opinion  .
Ya forgive your daddy
God is good
Quit throwing pin hoots on table and shuffling
Kinda sounds like a Keith Urban tune.!
Doctors heal thyself
Augmented
Should have stay where she was
This Todly SUCKS. END OF STORY
I love people here I'm happy I'm not the only one loving this
How long does it take for me to get my health fixed? I know you have not got multiple billions to fix me up but you celebrities might have to do a Poole to help me out for once
She drops this song when the Houston live stock show and rodeo is going on, Love it🫶🏻 Where my Houstonians at 🤘🏼?
Só isso? Esperei ela dançar.  Não dançou.
This is not country!!!!!!!! If tiktok had it's own line dance genre this would fit it perfectly but it's not country!!!!!!
Stolen from Franklin the Turtle theme song
is this not the official video? why is that scene on repeat? it's a weird video and looks like brainwashing. i will not be watching the rest of the video. the song and beat is good tho
I think it's great
Nope! Nope! Nope! Still don't like country music and this video is also dumb lol😂
Shades of a countrified David Bowie 🔥🔥🔥
Great sound. Wish she would dance 💃
😳wtf did I just watch
This aint texas song to put at radio station
It ain't country but its good
Song sucks
Love the song, but the video is just boring.
CULTURAL APPROPROTATION!! Why can't black people let us have anything without trying to copy and ruin it?
Ugly song. Bleedind my ears
Is it just me or did the same clip keep coming the whole time? Love the song tho
She alway dresses like a lady of the night great song but one dumb ass girl never liked her the things you can do with a shi, load of money time to leave country music alone pleas
Your song is amazing Beyoncé. Make more country songs and continue to make racists mad.
I hate this song with passion.  This aint even country
Kute song
All I can hear is the Franklin theme song 🤷🏼‍♀️
So sad all that money and this is the official music video. Really? Sad No creativity
https://youtu.be/OjJibuONB5U?si=S0B1zwMK3csNyaW_
https://youtu.be/OjJibuONB5U?si=S0B1zwMK3csNyaW_
So vulgar...no class at all, zero.
Beyoncé sucks at singing
❤❤❤
Trash song hardly country
A banjo and saying hoedown....doesn't classify this as country music. Its definitely not Country. It's a good song but it's cringey calling it country.
Load of shit
Please beyonce make a duet with Carrie Underwood
It would be better with the bi^^*h curse word.  Glad she is doing country.  I am the older generation, so I do not listen to her music regularly, but it is nice she is reaching additional audiences with country, and the banjo African-American players really need to get out there and show their talents too.
How boring and slow are these scientists.... Where's my trillions and cures! I'm going to up the anti. Sorry I'm like this I just need some support. The police was trying to find me a job but I just want my trillions back. There must be a trail. They can be this doughnut dim
Americans sure do worship guns
Like the song.  What else needs to be analyzed.  NOTHING.....get over it.
Ely musketeer aka Elon musk where is my health and money. Tell him I had acid thrown in my face x4 times like he has once
DAMN, country never looked so good 😮😮😮
this ain’t country music
Never make a country song again
This is not country.
regular hoedown for sure no class.
The6 say I need someone with dna similar to mine but it's not true because I'm originally born golden not white. So I dunno what everyone going to do now. I need every inch of my skin ripped out like when ryan was a child. Technology so advanced now it should be easy or not
Why is everyone so slow at this. I need a new heart, skin, intestines and puss. Tell everyone hurry up. Oh and a hair transplant or weave and my teeth fixed and my tongue fixed.
Hey it's Franklin The Gambler. Plagiarism at its finest.
First time to hear this. I don't know Franklin the turtle or Beyonce's music. It doesn't sound bad compared to new country but I wouldn't say this is country.
Why is this song the same as Franklin the Turtle?
Culture Vulture 😂😂😂
This is so bad😂
They could’ve did  way more with this video 😢
You're country music fucking sucks ruin it with you're bullshit
I like the song but what i dont like is how she is sexually exploiting herself when there are lots of young girls who idolize her!
What's there to hate??? You extremely talented and beautiful.❤
She plagiarized Franklin, the Tortoise theme song.      https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
Big boobs 😳
TERRIBLE. Go back to what ya good at Beyoncé - country ain’t ya thang girl.
She looks amazing. Best of luck to her.
This song is great for my kids play musical chairs
🥰🥰🥰🥰SHE DID YALL fr whatever y’all say she killed this song I can’t to see the line dances that come from this  til Tok going crazy as well  I can’t 😁I wait  ion care this blk queen is doing her thing making history this song is grate tht fact she didn’t do a line dance made it better let the ppl make their own 🔥 🔥 🔥y’all gotta give her due credit Beyonce hell I love her country music omg it made feel like a child with my granny us in the porch having a good ok time and yesssssss I’m a black queen i loves country music
This song has annoyed my yt shorts feed for like a week omfg its ok but its not that great c,mon y'all
Yeah..... I still don't like country.
No Country has class.  But this crap.  Sounds ok,  but really? Is the nudity country? NO. IF LADY ANTEBELLUM, DIXIE CHICK'S AND OTHERS HAD TO CHANGE THEIR NAME,  THIS HAS NO PLACE IN COUNTRY MUSIC.
The song is ok but the video is dumb!
I was kind of expecting a little more from beyoncé. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan. But this video was nothing but hypersexualization. She can do much better than that. I'm looking forward to her doing I totally different video to this song, showing us all what she's made of.
❤❤❤❤❤бомба
I have never thought Beyoncé had a good voice, I truly cannot stand her voice. She sounds like a mtf when she sings!!!
It's not a bad song, but the lyrics sound like whoever wrote the song was trying to check every country song cliché and see how many they can fit in one song. Yikes
❤❤❤
What is a visualiser ? If it is an ai generated video , it could have done much better , not that Beyoncé’s producers have a budget constraints . The song gets a thumb up though , easy on the ears ?
This isn't country.   Cute song but not country by any means
sounds like something straight outta young sheldon
Just what country music needs, more trash 🤮🤮🤮
❤Love it!!!
I'm going to message u all for the rest of my short life until Elon musk uses some of my money to fix me up. He has done something once before so it's not that hard to do it again. Tell him I might still love him maybe or not.
The fact this is the #4 music video is embarrassing for our society. Say what you want about the song but you can't convince me that's a top 4 music video in the world 🤦
Country music is hot ass , why make something like this
Girl put a shirt on
This video makes no sense and this song is horrible.
Huh? Beyonće doing a country-ish song. How about that? I like it, though. It's actually my first time hearing/listening to it ❤
I guess I gotta rely on Ely musketeer aka Elon musk. I know he loves me. I want £50 billion to fix every health problem. Tell him I might just have to love on him a bit more like in our South African days. Tell him how it is. He slyly racist so be carefu. Tell him I still look whit but I need golden skin. Chop Chop yall
Eu não tô aguentando mais essa música todo mundo tá gravando eu não posso mais assistir que eu quero ouvir no celular porque toda hora tá aparecendo por favor né baixar música 💔
If you talking to me I’m a slap you and I’m not I’m not playing with you
This is not country.
Essa música não tem clipe não entendi ela fica só assim?????❤❤❤❤
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA  What a joke...
Whares her shirt
GREAT music.    WEIRD video.   😂
This Rather looks like a Teminator Movie's Character shooting  than a Cowboy thing.......;Beyonce does Great Music though.......
Remind Elon musk I call him Ely musketeer and he got acid thrown in his face that's why he looks aged like me. I had is done 4 times. Remind him what I go through and tell him he is spending billions to fix me up. Ask him does he still love me??? Tell him I miss him being strict with me south African style. I need a new heart, puss, skin and teeth. Thank u xx
holywood stolen cultures all the time
Not a single cowboy hat
People seem to like the song... im a country  fan, but im just not feeling this... its got no heart, no soul, no culture... its just a catchy shit tune...
Love the music!!!
Beyonce will you tell Elon musk. Who loves me that the majority if them billions he has is mine. I need like £50 billion to change back to a woman. Tell him thank u for keeping my money safe and how is our daughter 💗
Ok, good catchy song, but severely disappointing video!
This is not country 😂
This is the worst...video....EVER, the song is ok
wtf a joke
This song sucks
LOL i swear Beyoncé could spit in a jar and yall call it music and love it
Beyonce is automatically entitled to sing country if that's what she likes. Maybe she likes all genres especially as an artist.
Só pra falar. A verdade ficou meio ruim e quase a mesma imagem 😅😊
Sir so beautiful. I will tell u a story once upon a time about ryan my husband was brain dead and he was trapped inside his own body kinda like how I'm a woman trapped in ryan body but my point is their is a genius waiting to emege that's screaming out to do more and ti's very frustrating.
You should have married idris elba not jayz

God, this so fking awful for so many reasons. 😅😅😅
I make  a cover with this music
Black people are so offended about Elvis apparently stealing black music ….. but they will ignore this ….?
Some please tell me why why why why people are so upset about this song lol. Fucking children
It has fragments of Franklin cartoon tune😊
Definitely not Texas county. More like a southern pop / gospel sound. Good song that belongs in Nashville
This song gives me we’re gonna have another forced lock down where we will be expected to park our Lexus’s and dance to this song in your own dive bar at home where you get wasted contemplating did I step to the right? I should’ve stepped to the left….or should I have stayed in the middle? Cause don’t be a bitch this gone be a hold up! What you gonna do?
I love Taylor Swift but I love this song
This ruins country
Franklin theme song
Congratulations
holy trash
The background music Reminds me of HEY FRANKLIN theme song .    The Turtle cartoon That my kids watched .when they were little .  They are 20-22 now.
Great song, but why all the nudity???
This isnt country
😂😂😂 this is not a country song...shit is trash
I like beyonce. But this is just too much. Not because she went country. I just expected so much more. Elementary at best. Hope to see it grow into what it could be
This just feels wrong and cringe worthy. I'll admit that I'm not a huge Beyonce fan, but there are a few of her songs I like. This genre is definitely NOT in her wheelhouse, though. 😏😬
The beginning reminds me of the episode of Futurama when Bender became a folk singer 😅😅😅
اذا لم يكن عندك ثياب سوف اعطيكي لاباس  احترمي قليلا المسلمين😢😢😢😢😢
I can do without the video. Put some clothes on.
WTH IS THIS SONG TAY IS BETTER
L song
❤
This is so good I didn't expect Beyonce to make it but surprise!
This is NOT country music haha
Nothing great. Why do all these women feel the need to reveal cleavages or show some ass. Is this a song or a porn video
After Queen, Legend , Iconic of POP and RnB, we are going to talk about .......Country World Music ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉 for another Title by BEYONCE❤❤❤❤

God help us when will this craze end
Franklin the turtle is popping off
Horrendous song and video....obviously she's trying to be relevant again,so let's just use the whole sex sell thing very classy Beyonce 🤣
Sorry..um no..
Congratulations on your milestones. Legendary legacy. So good so good 👍
Um, NOPE! This is a cut and paste special, just like the video... just because you can doesn't mean you should.
Finally a good song from Beyonce that you really wanna listen to over and over again What a way to go girl"
Stop appearing at my short
I don't get why this is so popular. Not a fan honestly. Love love her other music but this just feels like it's trying too hard..and not country sounding just because you add a banjo. Her voice isn't great for the country genre.  Sorry Queen this doesn't do it for me.
No, no I don’t know if that is true
I like the song but the video is stupid
F
Good country music can't be forced like this and many other modern "country" songs. The Destiny's Child song "Emotions" is worthy of being a country song. It is deep, normal people can relate to it, and it meant something to the writer. Beyonce for sure can be a country artist, but she has never lived the lifestyle.
What a pathetic video. Sings good that's about it.
She needs to stick to her genre. Not everyone can do country.
Bro thing she Sunway lagoon night park
Y’all want some real country music, go listen to Cj Jerome….aka C’ing Jerome🤠
Pray for her soul. She's some circles deep in dat Ria ngle.
iTS NOT A VIDEO PEOPLE IT'S A VISUALIZER SO YA'LL CAN STOP.....SURE VIDEO WILL RELEASE SOON ONCE SONG BLOW UP MORE
Disgusting!! Cover up 😈.
Country you say? Haha I gave it a listen... Definitely enjoyed the video, but y'all this AIN'T country
Okayy i understand the hype now.🔥  I fell in love with this song while listening to it for the first time in my life. 🫶🏻
She can't sing period. Country, rap, R&B, etc....she is ALL studio and deals.
Don't care for the music video.  Catchy tune though.
I just don't get why she's walking around half naked
I wasn't a fan at first, but I kinda like it. It's catchy!
I think it's good to hear this for the first time. But maybe be honest when people actually use other people's themes and songs to entertainment people who know country music.🤔😍😍
So. Friggin. Cheesy.
Hey it's Franklin soundtrack
Todavía besta buena la negrataaaa😊
I'm not over Renaissance yet, she is giving us now Act II? Ready for it!
As a Texan, I love the Beat and it's a Great Dancing Song, But I hope this is Not the Official Video. There's nothing there, but her playing with her breast, pointing a finger gun. I know she can do better than that video wise, if not call Darius Rucker, he knows how to make you visualize the Music.
Grammy for Best Country Album is coming
Someone clue dale Watson please country my ass
This is why the world is so divided. We need more of this. That fact that people are mad about this should show that they are the problem. The fact rather you like the song or not. It a song that has hit big with southerners. Let get country people into r&b life and throw some r&b city folk into country. AS CHEESY AT IS SOUNDS LET THE MUSIC BRING US TOGETHER. From what I seen there are plenty of people from every race doing the line dance of this song.let keep this going. We can all do this. A lot of dances in r&b are kinda like line dances. This is a great start let's keep it going.
boop singin
This not country music
Audio jungle
Country music been dead about 14 years now thank her for bringing light back onto it because sheesh I havnt heard country music since Reba Wilson and Dolly Parton and Carrie underwood 😮
Okay beyonce 🔥🔥
Worst video ever but love the song.
///• •///
It’s so strange as when I play this my cat jumps up and my tortoise comes out of his little hideaway, must have some special frequency ❤😮.
Beyonce,  she is special I love this xx
That's not country music and it's the stupidest song I have ever heard. I love her songs but she needs to keep singing Pop R&B
Nice mid tempo about a romantic overture played to a banjo background Beyonce may not be country but this tune shows she can adjust
Your song is 14 years ago, was even better than this crap
cover that one eye girl... tell them who you work for.......
Stupidest song I ever heard
It's okay, but a bit clichéd, and not real, authentic country. The best R&B artist (by far) who could do real country is the legend Lionel Richie with "Deep River Woman", Stuck on You", "Sail On" plus his exquisite production, and compositions, on the blockbuster Kenny Rogers album "Share Your Love".
Song sux tiddays are nice
This is not country music no matter how you sugar coat it.
Lame
Lame
Boring video...ugh
The song is good, but why is she just standing there in the music video?
She is so talented
As someone that generally like Country music, it isn't that bad
Nice Harmony,s  The intro was familiar , but the plucking  did a nice change up ..  Cool Song.   Something Different
The brilliant musician/vocalist Rhiannon Giddens truly delivers on her banjo lead. What a pairing!
Beyonce got those titties tho 😂😂
Kanye better ngl
🤑
Me encanta Beyoncé pero el vídeo es una mierda .
Love it ❤❤
I like all genre of music, I love this.
My first time listening to this. I like it
Não aguento mais essa porra de música meu Deus  🤯🤯🤯
What does her outfit have to do with tax?
I love country, this don't get it at all.
Why did she mention a Lexus? Texas is known for American made trucks state
This sh*t ass
Bey ❤
I prefer Alan Jackson. Hmm, hey Beyoncé's country fans, you know who Jackson is. Kisses from Poland.😂😂
WHY???
Beyoncé is just another one who sold her soul a long time ago to reach her level of fame. Sad. I see she’s still showing us her symbolism with the one eye in this “country” video.
She be making some trash songs recently
今日も最高の１日ありがとうございます！ 感謝します！
This ain't country like i grew up on, but i kinda like it.  Just a wittle bit.
Hey Franklin. Comin out to playyyayyy.
The video is terrible, just continual repetition of the same clip. But the song is good.
I have been a country fan since I was born and this don't sound right like the country I grew up listening to
Making waves is living. You can’t put Beyonce in a box 💃now get it B. Give your writer a bonus and collect that entertainer oty
Country music making a mainstream comeback and lo and behold she jumps on the bandwagon.  Awful song, truly awful.
suks
Love Beyoncé love the song …….. but seriously is it necessary to show so much cleavage, Beyoncé doesn’t need to be doing that …
Sorry but iff miss b thinks she is now a countrysinger then she really sucks. This is not countrymusic!!!
You have to be an idiot to think this is country , but ya know bow to your entertainment masters , do as they say 😅😅😅
This is not country and never will be and it's disrespectful to real country music
they could have spent a bit more on the video lol
God awful!
The budget for this video must've been astronomical.
They’ve spent a small fortune on this video clip
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😅😅😅😊🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂❤❤😮😅😊
I Swear if another award show decides she is not the best in her class in every category I will never watch another one and i will continue to call out their racism.
Not impressed one bit.
I'm not a fan of country or Beyoncé, but I am a big fan when racist's get triggered.
Damn my YouTube shorts are full of this music💀
After long time I loved Beyonce's songs so much 🎉 it's cool
Ho down.
I agree with those who say Texas doesn't equate to country. 'Country' must mean rural or it means nothing.
❤
I LOVE how this looks inspired by Lady Gaga a little. 🫶😘
കേരളത്തിലുള്ള റീൽസോളികൾ ഇതറിഞ്ഞിട്ടില്ല.. ഭാഗ്യം..😎
Copying a kids show theme how low can you go.  Franklin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqyE-lWqCE
Da funk is this shiz?
Personally, I wouldn't call this "country music" because the content is terrible.   "Tornado in my city so get in the basement cause that sh&% ain't pretty"....what? WHAT?  Was she just getting desperate for filler lyrics here? Good grief.   Regardless, I would venture out to say it's probably CLOSER to real country than most of today's country music. Banjos, believe it or not, began as instruments used by Africans. For those too hard-headed to research, just go watch Ken Burns' documentary on it. Country music is steeped in black history. White people just took it and commercialized it in the 1920s.
This ant Texas this ant country!!
I can see that 🪦
.
nothing makes this a country song sorry
Wat is dit voor een baggervideo. 😂
This song is not country it is pop this song does not deserve to be call country and should not be played on country radio Beyonce and all the other pop sing should stay the hell away from country music and stay in pop music
Missin beyoncé from the early 2000s ..
It has a billion views 😮
Why she doesn’t do music videos for her songs anymore? It’s extremely bizarre
This one made me puke. Not good enuf for country
I like it, i just wish she'd worn some clothes !!!
Boring song and video.
Bringing trashy to country! Sweetie you could've done something wonderful with a little bit of class.
U cant sing country song right, it just too weird. Im sorry Beyonce, leave it to Taylor Swift
Wtf am i reading in these comments? All these nerds saying "Now this is country" or "I never liked country until now". This is so far from country. None of you are country fans
A good Number. Sorry, Kylie Minogue was for 6 Years with a a good Country Track on Start.
Whatever you want to call it this song is great!
This song ruined YouTube shorts feed  Its not even a good song
0:01 penis
B thick and lovely, gorgeous woman.
Black people from the south created country music. Do your research people (Comment from @__Jordan_)
Bravo❤
Her outfit is horrible and the crap on her face is  even worse..but kinda cute song
People who are saying this isn’t country music is racist. The purpose of this album (Renaissance Act II) is to show that black people started country music and now you guys are saying it isn’t country music. Chill out with the racism gosh dang!
She looks amazing, but this video sucks.
I do not like her outfit. Doesn't fit the normal country style if dress.
Love this bc her voice is so R&B but the music and production truly is country. Love it
Балаларға не тәрбие беріп жатсыңдар ұятсыздар арсыз немелер😒
There is absolutely nothing country about this song. Just because you hit some stereotypes of country songs, and a banjo doesn't make it a country song.   And, I am not really a country music fan.  If you like that's great good for you. But don't call it country.
Bro she did the same thing over and over again
them cowboys goin wild in barnyard with tis one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
This aint Texas and this ain't country. But I love my queen b!
I would call this a hot mess ... Except it's not hot. What an absolute debacle! Doesn't get much stupider than this. I don't know what she was thinking with this one. Number one or not. I refuse to drink the Kool-Aid. 🤦
Practicing a challenge here 🤣🤣
Who's to judge what she sings
What is this video???
I hate this song bc i keep hearing this and when im bored this happens  and im more bored.
Let's Goooooo!!!
Country is looping over & over the image of a Dominatrix slow walking with inflated Boobs & a smoking finger ?  It's like Soft Core Ground hog day every 3 seconds. It seems that awkward repetition is the knew substitute for artistic innovation.  Her real talent was totally waisted on this. I didn't see this coming at all from her.
this is not country! give me a break!?
This make country hot again. Don't forget Chapel Heart also
A really stupid visual— could've rocked a bit more on this... however the song is country cool. 🤠
She has more trust in that jacket more than  i have in myself 💀   Edit: Beyonce , girl, i was just kidding 😅( please don’t k!ll me)
Wish she just  didn't have to do all the show off her body sex thing because the music is great and I am not a country music fan.
First she bleached her skin. Now she singing white folks music too😂
This is hardly country, I don't know what people are talking about. It's not bad though, I'll say that
What the bloody hell is this? All she had to do was copy the tic tok and she would have had a awesome dance.
The Pointer Sisters won a grammy award for their solid country song " FARIY TALE " written by Anita Pointer in 1973 check it out superb artists
How am i the only one that sees it’s her walking and then a repeat of that over and over again? How is this impressive ?
This sucks bro, this ain’t country at all dawg.
I like boobs but this is just strange
All it takes is a simple banjo riff on loop, the word hoedown, and voilà, you have yourself a country song. Waylon Jennings is rolling over in his grave as we speak smh
This ain't even country. There might be a hint of it, but it's more pop. Y'all can call it whatever you want though lol
Just as bad as most of the other country songs.
Essa música vai se tornar tão nostálgica daqui a 10 anos
I am a fines to me a am country
Call it what ever you want if you like it listen to it. Personally for me I don’t like country. But to each its own.
Reels/Shorts are ruining this beautiful song.
Because nobody is interested in boring hip hop anymore, Beyoncé is making country music. Just worse.
Why is beonce singing a country song?
Franklin the Turtle?
Love the dress up or lack of it......but why?❤
Haha this is Country?  Nope. I guess Country Pop just went non-Country.  Both songs are not Country.
Mediocre at best
I love this song! This is a great song. But it is definitely an AI and it is not a real Beyoncé video. We are going to have to learn how to differentiate from real and AI.
Ppl mad it’s not country. Ppl mad Beyoncé did country. I’m just here loving her voice in a catchy southern jingle. It’s so simple and such minimal accompaniment in an era of synthesizer everything. Beyoncé a queen for this one for great vox + catchy genre bending creativity and vision.
You don't know nothin bout Texas!
Just because you can doesn't mean you should  no hate though ...
This is pretty infectious
No. This sounds the same as her other music. Only change are instruments and rhythm. She is still singing the way she sings her other songs. I'm not feelin it.
This is not country lol and this video has a pop vibe to it. Not a fan sadly. It’s like the reverse swift move.
This song made me go and buy a horse and some cowboy gears 🤠
Country or not, it has an awesome beat and lyrics, and she shouldn't have to dress like a whore.
12 million views? That's it? She really isnt as special as people think she is...side note this song is horrible
Doesn’t sound anything like a country song lol just sounds like the rest of your overrated bs 😂
She should stick to pop.. leave cow boy music alone .
This shit SUCKS ? Worst damn country song EVER !
Cash grab.
This isn't country 😂
love to see the dislike numbers xDD oh thats right people get offended with neg things in life now xD
She weird as f
Nothing about any of this makes any since. The only thing that comes close is she seems to be dealing with struggles. As women age they become mature and respectful. This is the complete opposite and Mr Carter that is why your significant other hasn't received that award you publicly pouted about. I'm not hating on her because of her looks (she IS a beautiful woman) but it's definitely time for your 42 yr old a#@ to put on your mommy clothes and be a respectful woman, mother, wife etc. Why is it important to you to show the world so much of yourself, are you selling your talent or your body? Since viewing isn't restricted is this something you believe will inspire our youth.
this is country xDDD i guess now im a dog if u call this country xDDD . keep to the music u and not make country look bad xD have a good day
Tryna stay relevant ? Can’t believe people idolize these illuminate cult members
Texas does not approve
you GO Girl!! I have to say you look and sound awesome ,i have to say where did you get the bikini wax, just joking joke joke ! Country Music is AMERICAN MUSIC for All Americans to sing!!! IT !!!  ABOUT TIME AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love the video, simple yet powerfully ROCKIN!!
🤢🤮🤢🤮Gross
What kind of video is this?  Is she sending a signal? I’m totally baffled.
Is she actually saying she hates Texas?
I think is a little overhyped.
Entertaining song, I really liked it. The video was awful and classless.
Very catchy!. I get a New Orleans blues and jazz feel
She mentioned texas and showed her tiddies, so it must be country.
Alright Texas girl❤
Bigots gonna cry revisionism cuz ppl selectively buried and denied what they hated. It's not revisionism to provide a corrective to what was deliberately buried.  At the end of the day, if black country is included in country, no one's identity will suffer. And if black musicians play pop county, they have the right to trivialize and exploit country just like some white sellouts have done.  But they could also freely take the opportunity to enrich c&w, &c.   https://youtu.be/EmPf1CJaF5s?si=cv72LvQS-5WGdfUx
This woman doesn’t look more trashy because she simply can’t.
Song is  good but she looks so trampy  in the outfit.
No you don’t
This is an insult to Country Music............
NOT COUNTRY! POP WITH COUNTRY FLAVOR MAYBE! DEFINITELY NOT COUNTRY! JUST CUZ YOUR WEARING A HAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU COUNTRY! NOT EVEN CLOSE! HO COUNTRY POP?  SHE'S REALLY WANTING THAT ALBUM OF THE YEAR! 😅
Beyonce also has sung in Spanish for a novella. That will be the next meltdown for so many. 😂😂😂😂
Ridiculously ridiculous and absolutely useless... Nothing to watch and to listen to
This song has absolutely NOTHING to do with livin in the country. Yall should be ashamed, bless your little hearts. Some might even call this, Cultural Appropriation.
Why can't Beyonce wear some decent clothes?
All the sheep thinking this is good  have me cracking up
this is not country music sound like he making fun of country people
Great song!  Stupid video!  Scenes are so redundant!
She can sing every Hank Williams song , she's not country 😂
Poor Franklin.  Franklin sounds better!
This isn't country, it's country parody. I just can't.
Luv the song but i really wish that did more with the video
Beyonce voice is always amazing. But song overall is a bit boring and nothing new.
Sit down Beyonce, you're not a country singer!! Nothing against ya,but stay in your lane!!
Not one person knew this was Beyonce until they looked who the singer was.
🎉
Cadê os brasileiros fãs da Beyoncé ?
I am sorry I love country music and motown. I am not down with soft porn and defend our children who see this and think it is acceptable. Love your music- just don't like this video
Só eu vi?
Loving that a good song it last until 4 minutes
Trash can juice is what this is
She needs to give up u not a Texan ur pop pendeja 😂
You can almost see her question how she is presenting herself here, exposing her body in this manner, in an extremely intimate fashion, tempting us to look and gaze upon her and "feast" upon her with our eyes, to our own demise!  Yet you can also see she is suppressing that fear of wrongdoing and questioning her actions in the pride and stubbornness of  heart! 😭 It makes me so sad! 💔 This is the girl that claims she believes in God, from a group called Destiny's Child! No greater woes exist than those that exist for those who cause little ones to stumble. Shame on her. I hope she repents and turns to Christ Jesus, the Messiah and Savior of all mankind, if they only would repent and believe.
just when i thought country music couldn't get no worse.
Hi beyonce
Just no. Beyoncé needs to stay in her own lane. As for the visual of this video it's absolutely inappropriate. I've been a fan of country music for a long time and sure it has the lyrics but her voice will never be country. Put some clothes on and respect the genre.
I don’t listen much to country and I know damn well this some water down pop country bs 😂.
Franklin the Turtle theme song is better.
This flopped, as a texan I cannot call this country music. (it's garbage) Go join taylor swift in the trash pile.
Idk who wrote this for her by this song is complete garbage, her whole album is  in shambles. All those ghost writers your telling me you can’t make 1 hit?
This has been playing in my head for a week now!
This sounds more like R&B than country
Not much of a video .
Hahahaha this is the gayest song I’ve ever heard stick to what you know leave country music to people who know how to do it cuz you almost single handedly killed country music. Go away with this sad excuse of a country song.
No. Just no.
Setting a great example for blue ivy and the rest of the babies. Bet they love watching this video 🤦‍♀️
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlDib37xDBE
Aaliyah was fashion 😀
She could’ve put some appropriate clothes on
BEYONCE IS JUST BRINGING A NEW FLAVOR TO COUNTRY MUSIC. SHOWING HER TALENT OF WHO SHE IS, AND WHAT SHE IS ALL ABOUT. 💯👁👁👌🏾👌🏾👍🏾👍🏾😀😉🫶🏾🫶🏾🙏🏾❤️
This sounds like the Franklin theme song
I’m still waiting for anybody to give Bone Thugs credit for “Ghetto cowboy” https://youtu.be/EVm7Smq-T0c?si=gQUWzgW-vZJs80Dj
Now listen to the franklin theme song and tell 😂 me no Similarities
Nope don’t like it and video is not at all country
Oh, my.
😂
She grew up in Texas. I'm not great fan of Beyonce, but anyone who is mad at her for what amounts to "cultural appropriation" should really shut up.
Why is this song everywhere I hate it if you agree 👇
This is utterly embarrassing
I don’t like but I also like it a little
What the f**k is this video supposed to be? Terrible unless you're just here for the tities.
That is the Franklin and Friend's theme song 1997 cool remix
Shiiiiet
I HATE this song
What is wit this video???
We're still trying to stereotype... still locking people in little boxes
Boring video
All people saying they country fans now 😆  this ain't country
Get it girl
Nice song… The video sucks!!!!
Let’s go B
it's like saying basement jaxx is country, for take me back to your house. Or any number of genres they borrow from for their particular style of dance music. That thar folx is a pop song.
I’m a country lover irl so I love this❤
Great song! Who wrote that? You go Beyonce!!❤
Pride comes just before The Fall.  Jesus Saves.
such a dumb outfit.  No sublty at all.  She should be able to do better with that voice and money.  I don't get it.
:)
I love it ❤❤❤❤
I’m a find a country now. 😂

Franklin!!!!!! It's the Franklin theme song!!!!!!
Grande Porcaria esse Clipe
Beyonce, you are the coolest woman around the world! Love you sooooooooo much!!
Chorus might be catchy but This song doesn’t make any sense. This “visualizer” is even worse…😂😂
No one owns talent.  Do whatever you gifted to do. Some are so gifted they can do it all.    Why is it always something to be divided about 🙄🙄  Do ya thang Queen  B  🐝
Ayeeee beyonces gonna be in the old show franklin
You crazy if you think this will flop. This hits every single feel good part of country music down to the chord structure. She know what she’s doing and I’m absolutely here for it. This song fucking slaps.
A música é muito ótima
This is a mighty slick production using Autotune vocals, digital tracks, a nearly nude Yonce’ with dyed hair, lightened-up skin, and augmented breasts nearly fully shown, and has as much to do with country music as a mail-order Swedish penile massage toy.     At our bar we’re gonna put on some Johnny Cash “Cocaine Blues,” from the live show at Folsom Prison, and grab a cold Sam Adams, folks.
They're not getting through our borders with this one 🗣🗣🗣👏👏👏
This is not country
this shit is trash
Video sucks
I don't think it's the last because Beyoncé is a brilliant artist but this is more like X rated country music and some of the kids like the dance of a 2 teenagers you can't expose them to porno outfits is this all you got why you gotta mix porno in with country music sad
I am for any artist that does whatever it is they want to do but what I'm saying is Beyoncé is on the edge of almost porno my grandson wanted to listen to the record when he said oh my God she's damn your neck it that was embarrassing for me and she'll be embarrassing for her these are children we're talking about
This is like having a Toby Keith make a rap song. It just doesn’t make fucking sense
Why no clothes? It’s a good song. She’s a better country singer than whatever the other music was. I’ve never been sure.
In my opinion this song is trash. A mockery to country music. Beyonce you are an amazing artist but this song is beneath you .
This sucks
I can't see how any fan of country music would actually like this.
That outfit is stupid looking!!!
What's with the video???
No shade or hate but personally me I do not like this song 😢
This is dumb on so many levels.
ABSOLUTELY A BOP!❤🎉
I'm already tired of this song because now it's in basically every goddamn short now!
Not even country, but not much of the "country" songs nowadays are.
I'm convinced this is gonna be the Old Town Road of 2024. This is fire Bey!🔥
This is not country lmao
Video took a lot of thought 🤣🤣🤣
The Wackness..
Go on Beyonce enjoy yourself
This song  reminds me of Franklin the Turtle Theme Song!
She tries too hard! She tried to be entered as a Country singer and they said NO! She seems to think doing different genres will finally get her to win album of the year. No ma’am. You aren’t that strong of a witch. #message
❤❤❤
Franklin did it first
Catchy song & fine, people will still hate
Awful
This is different
Lame, but the outfit....
I keep hearing this everywhere and it so overrated
Lame
Smells like cultural appropriation. Gross.
But Beyoncé- why the robotic porno look?
Wow . Very irritating song
What is this
Caribbean people make the funny music they don't have depression vitamin D
Only true country music fans know this is not a true country song. You can’t make 1 country song and expect to be apart of the country music community. Old Country music will forever and always be better🤦🏼‍♂️
Sounds a bit like Lyle Lovett "LA County" still cool to see Beyonce with the switchup https://youtu.be/KGIsPLB9Ua4?si=GnJGwEjnBI-fbcG6
I can see this in a movie
She should get the country shit award..this is ridiculous
Lord, SHE'S A LIVING BREATHING GODDESS!!!!!! 😭🫶🥰🔥💖
The best country song ever!! Everyone with a tried country heart and soul loves it....can't wait to hear more ❤️ 💖 💗 💓
Whatever turns people on the search for better music....
As a Lexus NX owner, I’ll park my car and start Texas-style.
Tf lol?
Okay this isn't just me being a hater but am I the only one who thinks this song is way over-hyped?
Garbage
You aren't a country fan.
This is absolutely not country music WTH
This is a BANGER
I love Beyonce.  I love country, too. The lyrics are very typical cliche country.  It's only missing her truck's broken and the dog ran away.   Artists cross over all the time.  It's just okay for me.  2 cents.
For some reason, I feel like I have Deja vu when I see new songs published, it’s Like I’ve already heard This song before, even before it was released.
All I can say is that ain't country. That's what Hank said
LOVE IT BEYONCÉ  😊 🎉🤠
NOT COUNTRY
Camp Kiki wacka ahh song
Finally she is back. Music for soul
I don’t like how none of the tones sound like higher or like it’s kinda… monotone. I could nap to this.
🐢 Franklin the turtle theme song and a clip on repeat. Texas deserved better, she deserves better. They could have written a better song for her, it's Beyonce and THIS is the best "country" song they could come up with? I guess shock value is enough. 16 Carriages should have more views.
I love Beyoncé 🤭
If you think this is country music then all I have to say to you is 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
This not country music at all
Most boring video.   She could have done better
Not country
Very SMART to have a sure fire #1 country hit for her! Imagine the new young country fans that will flock to her shows!! Kudos!
She truly means “hey it’s Franklin”
She screwed the country music!! disgusting!
Sounds like she’s grasping at straws, everything popular with country let’s throw in one song and try to be country. Ridiculous. She can’t get a Grammy for her albums so she’s gonna try another genre!! Y’all are dumb falling for it!!!
Perfeita sempre 🖤Vem para o Brasil Bey ❤️🇧🇷
Best country song I’ve ever heard! ❤
JUST U GO FOR IT I  LOVE IT HAVE  A  GOOD TIME
If only I could block this song from the shorts
I absolutely hate you for making this song it is hella annoying and it’s all over my fyp and I hate it
I like the song, but the video was sh*t
😂😂😂😂😂 Who the hell says LEXUS in any country song 😂😂😂 She could have said FORD or Chevrolet she picks LEXUS.  DEFINITELY NOT COUNTRY 😂😂😂
Great song. Boring video.
I wish I thought she has as good of a body as she thinks she has.
👎
This is different from her regular music.
It's good but the vid is just here walking.
❤
What the hell is she wearing...how embarrassing for her and her whole family
THIS AINT TEXAS!
This ain't Country but even Country hasn't been Countey for iver twenty years!  Good song for Pop gentry.
The video clip is disappointing.  Cool song though
I looooved this song(not a Beyonce fan) but this video 🧐🧐🧐 why, could have been sexy and fun, this just seems .....🤷
“ALL COUNTRY MUSIC IS BAD!!!” *Beyonce makes a country song* “Country music is so good!!”
Can't stop playing this❤️‍🔥
This song sucks in any medium and any genre.
this is so not country it’s bad
This songs sucks
crap ear worm...
Girl ur song took over YouTube 😭
Damn girl you did good! 👍.   I am sure you once again won’t get the recognition you deserve for this music,  but please accept this 66y/o music lovers thank you for the enjoyment & a bit of happiness 🤗
Beyonce is such a treasure. This is pure magic. <3
This isn’t country 🤦🏻
This sucks
My fav song so far❤
Okilovesog
This doesn't sound like country at all
She gonna pull a Kanye trash move and try to get an album of the year in the country category since she can't get it done in pop 😂 pathetic
GAHH I CANT ESCAPE THIS SONG LET ME GO
This is junk. Not country at all
This is shit
Its not country music nerds
That outfit is the most uncontry thing I have ever seen.
Bloody damn sang is popping on YouTube shorts its making me go insane 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i can't i am about ti kick someone or throw my phone
Hillbilly music?
This isn't that bad
This is pop not country no offense Beyonce
What a ridiculous outfit for the country song, this is how not not to be taken seriously, also sounds like a mix match of previous tracks
You don't have to like this song, nor Beyonce.    But to be offended over this song existing as a country song, or enraged at Beyonce existing as a country singer, that's racist af.  And I hope y'all know that the invention of country music came from the folk music sung & created by African American slaves.    Yes, just like rock n roll, black people invented country music too, and then it got taken over by white people.
Garbage
Is this the actual video? This is the most stupid thing I have ever seen.
Beyonce is so fucking good at anything she does. It amazes me. Now I just want to hear more country music from her. Wish she'da done this a long time ago. She is from Texas. This music suits her well.
Just here to see not music lol
This definitely not country music 😂
Shame she has to appear like this, in the video of what would have been a really enjoyable and suprising good song. She is playing up  beautifully to the stereotype of a witless airhead female singer. Isnt it time to grow up and attempt to be a good example to the younger generations (she aint in the first flush of youth, any longer)😊
Im usually a country fan but this one is different
Yh as above so below
Amei
I’m sorry but why is she always half naked in all her songs😭?
All of a sudden I love country music 😂is this maskandi South Africans?
Lol, so Taylor Swift went from Country to Pop. Beyonce is Country now, lol.
Trash
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been Shazamed over 500k times! Keep Shazaming the song! It helps with radio play! 👑🐝
No ty
I mean.. you’re Beyoncé. You’re already so great. The greatest! Why do you need to wear next to nothing? This isn’t really art.. or great fashion. It looks so slutty and you don’t need to dress like this to look beautiful and sexy.
Didn’t this used to be the “Hey it Franklin” theme song?
I'm rocking that same outfit in my cover!  https://youtu.be/CXLVhNuCBL4?si=MtOJc-jGx1nicyZR
I hate how people think this is a country song
Finally queen B is doing country...
This song SO overrated tbh
Now she trying ro spread her witchcraft even fuether to the country population.....the demons know the time is coming...she trying to gather as many people as possible to take to hell fire with her
Soooooo, exactly what does this VIDEO have to do with COUNTRY music?? I’m lost?? 😮
The videos other people have made are considerably better than whatever this is. The song isn’t terrible though.
How did this get so many likes? Video 🗑,  Song 🗑, Cleavage 🥵🔥
Garbage
I’m not sure what is happening here but I’m not sure it’s country. Did she say popping a Lexus?
One, it’s a boring video. Two, she’s barely dressed three, it sounds like country, but it’s not country and she is not country.
I am a country music fan. George Strait is my absolute favorite. Is this George Strait country? No. Is it any worse than Florida Georgia Line or that ilk? No. Do country fans like FGL and hate this? Yes. Because they are huge hypocrites.
It's COUNTRY!!
I don't like the song
Tell me ChatGPT wrote your song without telling me lol. I'm from tx too and a Lexus is not what we're parking.
Ha! Wouldn’t matter the lyrics of this song the video would suck yous all in regardless!! This isn’t even a country song. I like it anyway but jeez be real
she's so talented!!!
cannot wait for the album!!!
This is the video? Boring 😮😮
This isn't country. This is trash.
I NEED VIDEO OFICIAL FOR THIS SONG PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This has to be the cheapest music video ever filmed!  That outfit looks like it was made out of a torn up leather couch and nothing but a black green screen!  I think they could have done a lot better job on this considering it’s a great effin’ song!
This is not a country song. She may be from Texas but did not live the country life style. Not to mention she's talking about a Lexus then she says bitch in it like let's be real she's not jelly roll and was falling off the charts an tried to come up with something to. Put her self. Back up there. I mean she says the same thing over and over again there is nothing country about her or her song 😂
All these people suddenly making country songs (or attempting to) probably never even lived 1/4th of the country experience.  Itd be like dolly doing drill rap.
This song sucks.
This sounds like an episode of young Sheldon
this is a vibe
I need more......❤❤❤❤❤❤
When you realize you are no longer relevant and have to try another genre … not country.
This is garbage. A lot of country music is invalid. Outlaw country is the only true country music. It wouldn't be so bad if it was authentic. County music doesn't need a new sound. Especially this autotuned crap. Stay in your lane Beyonce. Your music is better that way.
Yesss girl!! 🫶🏼🖤 we need more.
Trash!
I luv song and raised up on variety of music!!!
It grows on you😊
Hate country this is kinda good
Is she serious?? Give it up Bey and go lay down
😂 she just ruined country music lol😅 stop while your ahead
This is country pop not country
Pls put clothes on😅😅😅 pls don’t think I’m being mean this is the best song btw
She is full of shit.
This is the dumbest song and video ever.......
This is hardly country.   Got an acoustic guitar, and she says “Texas” and “hoedown”, but this is crap country.
Trash
Took me half of the video to realize it's the same thing being repeated over and over again
Mediocre cw song. I go pass on this one and y
There is just something about this song that makes my feet stomp on the ground. I have listened to it for the last hour, over and over again!
Slop!
I hate this song
I absolutely love this from her!
I love the video production lol
Love this song hope it gets to number one ❤
I've been saying she need to do country for years for that Grammy but what's the point now she's won every other award for her performances have only one Grammy is just disrespectful.
The lyrics and beat are country pop, but Beyonce is not country. Reba would have sung this song 100 times better. Nothing about the way Beyonce sang this is country she doesn't have the soul of a countrymen she's just singing lyrics Her hearts not in it and you can hear it in her voice as she singing.
Trash
Put a shirt on
Stupid music video she's not even doing shit
Did Beyonce know her record company was doing her wrong? This is the theme song for the cartoon Franklin.
How is this even country? Just bc you’re from a state that is “country” themed does not mean you’re country. She distracting y’all for sum. 💯 you all fell for some trick. lol I find it crazy how Toby Keith dies as well and all of a sudden homegirl desides she’s “country”. Lolll  nah cuh, she about as devoted to country life as nas is to Jesus🤙🏼🤷🏼‍♀️Js
Музыка прекрасна только зачем этот имидж? Вообще неудачное видео. Очередной привет от "того парня"
So Beyoncé with a banjo equals Country music now!? This is terrible😂
This dog shit point blank . . . 😢
This isn't country, this is garbage.
She should stick to Country music only in the future
Can I just ask, WHO deemed this "country" ? Was there a vote or something ? Wtf ? Nashville Tennessee born & bred. I know country music & this right here... Ain't.
Ami siempre me ha gustado la música cuontry pero escuchando está versión se me movieron los ánimos.
Nope
This is a great song but the music video is absolutely disgusting why show your body parts like that Beyoncé I love ur songs but I don’t like u showing ur body
@easybreezy9666 Shut Up
Nope
I just don't like her music
Like the song but not the outfit
Absolutely AWFUL
I want to listen to cotton eye joe now.
Engineer mains, let's do this TEXAS STYLE.
Doesn't sound country to me. But it's all good
Disappointed in this video
Not sure what this is but it definitely is not country. It sounds like it belongs on an Disney movie for teens.
This has to be the most boring video ever.
Szeretem ❤
Straight garbage.  Just like the rest of her music.  Most overrated music artist since Elvis Presley
Bey about to make good money Off of the dances and Tik Toks y’all kids make from this 😂😂😂  Get to the bag Bey!
Trying to figure out why she needs to be half naked?
Beyoncé has White heritage too, specifically French from the French Americans who mixed with African-Americans and made a mix called Creole. She sings about her Creole heritage in other songs. Given the large French folk music influences in the South and in Country music it makes sense for her to explore this side of her. Don’t hate for the sake of wanting something to be mad about.
Didnt know being country involved being naked
Go girl! love it!!!
This is some saranic shit
I wass already a country fan...but what is this-
Why is the whole video the same like 30 seconds over and over
Someone needs attention again. 😂 What a joke.
I've been trying to understand why some humans have be haters, Beyonce did her thing, yeah it's not r@b but it doesn't matter it's music 🎵🎶 and that's all that matters, and if they knew anything about history they would love to know that black people made country music 🎵🎶 and a lot of other things as well .
This don’t really remind me of country Im used to hearing but props to her
Beyoncé o que falar dessa mulher,  que tem um timbre de voz que se adapta a todos os estilos de música, só não gostei muito do clip achei sem graça poderia ter explorado bem ela, por ela ser uma ótima dançarina, mas a música é show
Franklin the turtle
sh1tass song. they just make anything these days lmao.   stay in your lane my black queen ❤😂
i love that song ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Satanista, estas derrotada porque Cristo te vencio en la Cruz. Gloria al Cordero que vencio y vive por Siempre.!
😡 plz delete this
If you love Beyoncé   👇
just sounds like red neck woman...
i love music 😍😍❤❤ texas holdem pouh pouh 💣💣
This song is wack
Trash
She done a great job  Putting this song together
Anyhow this was made by any legitimate country artist all of you knobheads would say it's generic country garbage, and call country music as a whole garbage. This is primarily why the Beyonce fan base is so toxic. Yall ride her for everything. She's nothing special. She makes mediocre music and looks semi above average for a woman her age.
What's up with Beyoncé's CGI boobs? They don't even move like boobs.😂
I like the sound of it, but it sounded like she just made a notepad full of shit country people do, and they just threw it all into a song like a goulash
She slays  ❤❤❤
This isn’t country.
Ew
A snake over one eye??? Seriously?? Ppl ignore the obvious so disgusting
This is not country what the hell
IM OFFENDED!
Way to ruin country music
Franklin has entered the chat.
A 304 pretending to sing country
This is terrible. Def not a fan.
Im going to blow my fucking brains out if i hear this shit one more time on social media
I'm sorry but this is wack.. too poppish
😂 this ain’t country
Trash 🗑
Great song but it's more pop. The tune and part of the chorus is country but that's about it.
This song is stupid I can make it sound like something
Paraaaaa com isso todo short é essa música q merda aff 🙄
Really I thought there would be more video of her doing something other than Blowing her finger out, Iol
cultural reparation
Tasteless and disgraceful
Never liked her music but I'm loving this song!!
U ppl are delusional
J'aime beaucoup le nouveau Beyoncé il l'est bien le visuel 💝🖤💞💟💞💝🖤💝💟💞🖤💝
Put your clothes on honey.  You can not sing country music. 😂
Worst song ever
I woke up like this… (x2) BBQ no mildew…..
Yee doggy, HOWDY der FOLKS!! 🤠
Not even a country song
is this porn?
Cool video
Love the song, hate the video, lol
She couldn't afford an undershirt? 😂
They wanna be us so so bad 😂😂😂  Like little puppies that want our attention and approval 😂😂😂
She's got to come up the boots of heart now
Beautiful Song😊
She should calab with David allan coe
Time for round 2 at the country music awards. ..with Taylor 😂.. I'll be watching  see what drama happens.  😂
Horrible
Obviously thus isn't the video still dope.
Wow
This is what people who don’t listen to country music think country music sounds like.
This is a pathetic video. And y’all wonder why Taylor swift is killing it. Beyoncé legit ain’t shit and is a horrible role model for young black women. She’s not a musician doesn’t write her own music or play any instruments and this video should have been more than a pair of tits.
Pretty sad you got 26 million followers here and 11 million biews and you cant even get 300k likes. Im pretty sure you got ratioed for stealing franklins theme song. This is garbage and it finally seems people are seeing and hearing it for themselves and waking up. Where da baehive at? Even they dont support this terrible take. You aint ever winning another grammy. You tried to reverse taylor swift to see if it could work and you and you terrible husband can eat it right now. Cause this song and video are hot garbage
It's starts off the same a "we were we us" by Kieth Irving and Miranda Lambert.
Sexualizing country music video now thatssss wild, but I meannn jelly roll switched genre and Is killlllllling it lol
0:30  “and I’ll be damned id caseoh dance with you” 💀💀
Definitely a new direction. Beyonce also has breast implants? I remember back in the day when she was flat chested.
Country music needs some segregation in it. This shit needs to stay in the filthy lane with hip a hop ah,and rappa crappa. Mstbe she can be the first to perform im the nude at the grand old Opry or that sacred piece of original wood floor at centerstage. Duh.....
I love it!
Forget something under the jacket Mama Its sad
Mediocre Fun country pop. But how does her outfit fit with the country theme. Sorry…big miss on this one Beyonce
Trash
J'adore
Shes got a cracking set of thighs
The song is OK but the video is the most boring thing I have ever seen, I really don’t get it it’s the same shit over and over and over so boring and not on brand
Love U 💙Thanx For Your Love😘
Love the song but the video is a disaster. Beyoncé missed a huge opportunity to upload something upbeat but instead decided to go half naked. Very disappointing Beyoncé.
Um chapel hart does it better
Wheres Your Shirtttttttttttt💀
Novice😂
Down vote
For anyone who thinks this is beyonces first "country" song please listen to her song daddy lessons with the Dixie Chicks
What hot garbage
Not Country dont argue with me if you have a town population over 1000.
Il y a du rythme mais le clip est basique...
Que gostosa
Everyone is overreacting to this song. It's okay. It certainly isn't the worst country song ever.  The ending is good.  I'm definitely going to give her other songs a listen.
What a crap song lol
Even Beyoncé knew the best type of music was COUNTRY!!!!
Sounds like naughty gospel set to an electronic drum beat to me with oos rather than yehaws
Trash 🗑️
Hey it's Franklin
Our white Queen 💖
Sorry I love Beyoncé but this is garbage.
Is she doing "white face"? 😮
Who cares the genre.  Good song shut up haters
Beyond messed up that MTV censored her cleavage but  "shooting" (with her fingers) is totally fine. 🤢
This ain't bad actually gotta admit I dislike Beyonce but I will admit   Not bad
This shit is overrated as fuck 💀
A true artist, not afraid to study and explore different genres! She's definitely the Queen of Music!
Hey! It's Franklin!
All the money she got and the video is the same stupid scene throughout. Couldn't afford more footage? 😂 Btw the song is complete 💩💩💩
You got some hidden talent   Keep that shit hidden 🔥💯
Really? Gotta call someone a bitch right off in your song. You just nasty and need to go back and learn etiquette.
😋😜🧐🫦💏🤱🏻👪🥒🥒🩲
Casius Clay  , play game , casius politic
WHAT THE HELL?   AHHH NO!!!
Video is just has stupid as the song sluty not country
CARACA MUSICA DO INFERNO PQP PARAAAA
This song hits but what is this mv?????
Country Music has hit an all time low. Pathetic.
This is NOT country!
She ripped off Franklin ffs
Beyonce pretending 2 be white is fine but a white girl gets cain rows thats racist
Seems to be a little more proof that she’s part of the illuminati showing that one eye symbol
Put some clothes on
This is trash !!!!
Exit stage left
Palintologi theme song
This isn't even courty music it's fucking gospel!! get it strait!!!
Lol this is horrible
#1
BETTER than any Taylor Swift i heard
No no no honey, stay in your lane. This is horrible.
This cheers me up sooo much and makes me dance too. Love it
I'm curious, did they accidently edit out her belly button or are her pants over her belly button. Or is this a mistake and she just revealed she is a reptilian alien that doesn't have a belly button? Last ones a joke for all you people who took it serious. But seriously where the hell is her belly button 😅😂
The most boreing video iv ever seen
Beyoncé is sadly no different than a stripper with a pleasant voice. I would never want my wife to be showing so much of her body to the free world. It’s sad how women in particular have been deceived into thinking this is “independence” as an artist or even as a person. There is nothing artistic about being naked. You notice when music videos started coming out the talent started waning. That’s because “artists” started depending more on visuals and content of their videos. So things like sex, drugs, fame and glory are all imaginable for one’s life when watching a video but nobody has to have a great song for people to want to watch a video. I would say that time period is specifically what opened the door to the music industrys self destruction.
It Does sound like the cartoon Franklin theme song lol.
The Illuminati has invaded country music!  Your desperation is showing!  #MAGA
Hey its Franklin 🕺🕺🕺
Nice teets
this is  fucking  gross
Ayoooo
Is this a joke ??or satire ??
It’s the Franklin song omg it is she ripped off Franklin. And she can only sing in one key and can’t hit all the notes in that key . Adel is so proud of your .lol
What a poser! I wonder who wrote it for her...cute & good for the dance floor tho.😊
Beyoncé is one of the greatest artists of the decade, perhaps even of the century, but black people need to not try to do country music lmao.
She ain't country and 😂
Why does she have her books out
Next she'll do "wow wow wubzy". 😂😂😂😂
The words of the song make no sense
Beyonce saved music to the point everyone can listen and enjoy it .
Wonderful song.. wasted video
This song is so trash.
This is more her culture than “black”
This has been my favorite from Beyonce that I've heard. The pop/r&b genre isn't really my thing, not that country is either but this just sounds so good to my ears
What a joke!! GO Back to your lane. Country music is not in the Illuminati's house.
only country music ill listen too
She straight up stole Franklin the Tortoise theme song.
Atta way to ho up country
You resized country music
Clothes optional 🙄
Shit video!! Why does everything av to be sexualised
You are the best nothing to say
It isn't right why she looking like The Terminator
She's half naked like the wife of Kayne, why promoting this, is this the way women want to present themselves? No. Is this the way men like to see women ? Yes.
This isn't country. This is trash.
Her voice is perverse 🤌🏽
Absolutely love the song and it stands alone without putting  women back generations using sex to sell something.  She’s beautiful and super talented; no need to get your tits out, especially when you are a mum and followed by so many young people.
Kiss an Angel Good Morning by Charlie Pride is a really good country song. A growing percentage of country music today, sadly to say, is AI-derived. That comes from Otis Gibbs himself. So I agree with most people here, Texas Hold Em is a modern-day country song.
Doesn't this single have an official music video?
Part of this is country; the other part is over-sexualised, oh wait.... 99.99999% of it is over-sexualised the other 00000.1% is a bite sized bit of southern pop.
Thanks Beyonce for your happy song. Also bringing back the line dancing movement  🎉❤
I see why she chose the silver horse and the name of her last album, renaissance!  She was gonna have a rebirth (the meaning of renaissance) in her music, which would delve into the country world!  She is a genius!!
HEY ITS FRANKLIN lol. That's all I hear. The Franklin theme song
Lmfao. This is fucking stupid🤣 she’s a clown.
And starts like that popular TikTok sound title 'Makeba.'
Like the song but the clothes you wearing you know kids could be watching
Those T*****S Tho....🙃😆💯
Not a country music fan or a huge Beyoncé fan but this goes hard!!
This shit is booty 😂
This song sucks, she needs to stay in her lane, and it’s not country!
I don’t even like country music but this one kinda hit
Wait till they hear Charlie pride
Who else found that YT randomly subscribed them to her channel? I wonder just how many subscribers are bots and people who never subscribed in the first place. YT is a pos also this sounds like that turtle cartoon.
Jmo... garbage.  Hard pass.
Not country and it's fucking shit. 🤣
This songs sucks
Not for me
Put some clothes on
WERE NOT GOING TO TALK ABT THAT FIT😮😮😅😅
beyoncé////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////songs///////////////////////////////////////////////2024-2060-jacquie thieng
Lol, she ripped this off from bruce cockburn franklin theme song
Horrible video. The repetition is boring & annoying.
Holy sh@t this song pisses me off this ain’t country music this is new music I’m 14 and I listen to everything except this genre of “country” it’s not is pop it’s horrible listen to Eric church Jason Alden Toby Keith somebody other than Beyoncé for country music
Leave it to Beyonce to make me like a country song!
Wtfff is this video??? Shame on you beyonceeee
This os horrible
What the f is this film clip about
Umm stop appropriating my culture funny how when the shoes on the other foot aye
Slay
What happened with the hand hun ?
Hank did not do it this way.
Meh
Don't understand this theme with her getup. How does it match with the country pop up?
This isn't country, folks. Go home.
Hey, it's Franklin! Coming over to play Growing a little Every day  Here he comes with all his friends They've got stories, got time to spend with you!  Hey, it's Franklin! Coming to your house Hey, it's Franklin! Coming to my house Hey, it's Franklin!
WTF is this the whole video
Damn… put some clothes on… cover those boobs!! Guess you got to do that to sell the song! Sorry, just speaking the facts!
Bruh I can’t even watch shorts anymore without hearing this. It’s more cultural than Mariah Carey defrosting.
I suddenly like country.
Horrible
I fall in love with this country music ❤.
Just came to say this song is complete trash
This ain’t Country 🎶🎶🎶
Yuk😮
Normally not an overall fan of Beyonce's music (though I love Single Ladies and Listen), but this song is FIRE ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Omg people this is NOT country....  you want Country listen to George Jones, Johnny, Merle, Waylon, John Conlee, Don Williams... this is trash.
its been only 2 weeks and this video has already 11 Million views..
This is the worst fake country song I've ever heard . Talking about going to a dive bar? This chick has never been to a dive bar one day in her life. .
this is the laziest music video ive ever seen, compared to something like single ladies which was innovative this is garbage
Now they want to mess up country music too. Please no…
Any song that refers to a Lexus is not a country song
Put some clothes on old lady.
All in
All the people in the comments who claim that they're "suddenly country", have no idea what real country sounds like or what it is in general.
This is not country but still good 😊
Love the song but it deserved a better video instead of her just walking and shooting a gun
Hey it’s Franklin theme song ass song😂
I don’t think she single handedly wrote the song
Trash
This is the farthest thing from country as you can get😂
Complete garbage 🗑️💩
Lol this song is awful.  And whats up with the video, its like on repeat she just keeps walking, shooting a make believe gun... repeat.  Could u imagine Reba McIntyre doing a rap song, this is the equivalent.  Please stop
I’m tired of hearing this shit everywhere
Por fin logró un macrohit Beyonce. Excelente tema
this is not country music 😭🙏🙏
Love love love this song.
❤Your right this is W , I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore! Opps I mean if Texas. I truly hope hope as you hold your cards. You remember the brick road. Regardless. ❤

She has no clue what country is.
Wtf is this bullshit 😂😂 people really acting like this is a good song just cuz it's Beyonce singing it🤦 she needs to stop
This outfit is cringe.
No thanks. Stick to your style
Ngl this shits wack
Classic Country Sound. She didn't change a thing. Even her hair is CLASSIC Texan. I have never watched the CMA's - but best believe I will watch this year! Country music was kind of dusty. It really needed a refresher. And Beyonce will bring in new fans, worldwide and here in the USA.  But, some of dem are BIG MAD LOL
This is fucking putrid. Poorly written and arranged disposable garbage. its being laughed at by the entire music industry
You remind me of Floria 3:22 3:24
Garbage video
Stupid video. Thought she would be dancing not blowing fire off her fingernail
Nope. 😂
I heard everyone talking about Beyoncé making a country song but this isn’t a country song lol 😂
Stupid song
Country music is for the every moment of my life. And f**k you if you don't call this country. Pop's from Los Angeles. By the way I have sang country music and the blues rock and roll. And got paid for it.. little boys are crying because the gurl got music. And getting paid for it.
No...just no.
Love the song the video sucks. Thank gosh for the tik tok ones from people who are dancing…. Having fun.
I can dance with this all damm night long
Yikes!
When will she put out a death metal album?
damn, i wish I looked like that after kids
I’m sorry we all like things. Yes I’m not Really like it come see stronger but this is different and I really like this one but those clothes it’s just a note for me
Nothing creative about this video. Yawning.
And since when is it ok for a lady to show her body to the public like this especially children. This belongs in a porn movie. Society is disgusting
Straight 🗑️ 🔥
Stick to rap beyonce this song sucks
A billionaire decides to throw bunch of nonsense words together that make no sense with back up singers and she pretends it's country and you all are just doing what they want by feeding this entertainment monster that's got you all in a choke hold. Sheep
She makes you want to get some tassels and throw it around your dog or cat 😂😂 😺🐈
People forget that country music was originated from black people
Nice clothes but her clothes not make any sense
This is crap. It's not even close to country! Put some clothes on for Pete's sake!
pretty sad
Hey it's Franklin
This is a loose form of pornography with a county theme. Beyonce, you have a daughter think of her when you do your songs. Some things are not appropriate.
Wtf im i lookin at and hearing this shii is actually așš
This song fucking sucks, quit blackwashing country music.
Daddy lessons is still better according to me & my favourite
Good song
Im from Alabama,and im not happy with this so called „country song“be fr if you wore that in the south you would get stairs on every town and street this annoy‘s the crap out of me to see these posers online this is fake „country“she’s kinda mocking the people from the south y’all who actually can sing country without having to put a fake accent on.no hate I love your music
Like the song, the video not so much.
PLEASE MAKE IT STOP 😂🙄 Just go home
This is not country music.
Idk what to say about this she has a beautiful voice but idk if she should do country and the video sucks what is the video supposed to do with country. Her rack isn't a buck or anything it's just boobs her half naked has nothing to do with country
Trash. This isn’t country at all.
bro, why is the thumbnail so revealing dawg 😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
Why tf is this all over my fyp?!??
Well that video took about 3 minutes to produce
this is not what i was thinking. dancers with costumes.
Sorry beyonce. Not country
This is not a good song and why is she dressed like that. Cover up
Not worth watching
Is this supposed to be a video? No wonder she has never won album of the year. She sucks bigtime!
Just wait till they find out we haven't even got Act I music videos yet lol 😂
What a waste of time 🙄 …
Queen B is originally from Texas. It’s about time she gave us some country!! Sweet song! Bring it home QB!❤️❤️
thats not coutry music people so dumb
When millions of people disappear instantly they will say it was alien abduction. But it will have been Jesus who came to rescue his Church before the 7-year Tribulation 🙌
Love the song! Video, not so much...
Wow, techno drums on a country beat with a Knigge singing on the back. What the fuck
She's so ahead of the curve.
This is not country. Like at all. Thats like saying Taylor swift can rap. Just no.
God song but get some clothes on and be a role model for young girls!
I love this song
This is just God awful. Number one 🤯
Let them know, Beyoncé. All over the world, and still from the SOUTH. 🤎
Come on it's Franklin Let's have some fun
Barfs I will say, Beyonce is the best dressed Rodeo Clown I've ever seen 😅
Illuminati Queen
Swifty's ain't got shit on the queen bed!
Why does she have to dress all trashy my gosh get some class.
Lmfao...such a trashy video and crappy song
Rip off
Simple.   That's all the effort you give for a country song debut.?  Country fans aren't simple and this feels like mockery.    Song was catchy but it's the disrespect for me.   Nope.  Her other "cowgirl" getup especially.
Yall an add came up for a bra in the middle of this
LMFAOOOO horrible absolutely horrible you’re not that honey and we all know why you’re #1 on the country chart but I won’t say anything else😉🤷🏼‍♂️
No satanic symbolism in sight, thats for sure lol....
yeah this sucks
𝓘𝓽 𝓱𝓪𝓼 11,308,960!!! 𝓥𝓲𝓮𝔀𝓼!!
Your kidding me right.  This ain't country. It's shit.
The real reason why people are so split because people who like new gen music are comparing this to the old gen completely dissing old music, which understandably triggers old music fans. So then it becomes a whole mess.
Ugh
Overrated *
She's one of the most operated artists of our generation
🔥🔥🔥🔥 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Sleezy Country....sucks!
Junk
The lyrics are basic. I listened again to see if it's something I'm missing but it's not. Y'all such sheep worshipping a human will send y'all to hell with her using subpar talent, lyrics and artistry!!!  Please turn back to God and wake up!!!
I listen to everything, when I heard she was being hated on for her country song, I have to admit I too was skeptical. That being said....I liked it.
Beyonce going country is different
The best part of the song is the last 10 seconds.  It's over hyped like most things. Doesn't sound interesting or jaw dropping!!
Country Music does not need CRAP like this....I hope it is a total failure and that Beyonce goes back where she came from.
This ain’t country yall🥶😱
The song sounds alright but it isn’t country. Country left a long time ago.
Beyoncé Franklin.
I liked your more pop music
Why the nudity tho 🙄 the song is good enough… no need 🙈
Am I the only one who realizes that this song has so many views because there on mute.  Couldn’t make it threw but then again I’m not 14 and I’ve seen them tits for what about 20 years good luck
This doesn't work with a country beat. Should have had Timbaland help out on this one.
Yeehaw!
All the country singers missed one thing, sing  your titss out 😂😂😂
Yeah this is NOT country music
Best country song I heard in a while
Love the song.  Video is stupid
My goodness, what a horrible song. Sorry, but she can't do everything!
Ugggh.  I am so tired of seeing Beyonce 3/4 naked.  I don't really like her music very much and the nudity and swearing is the opposite of the country music vibe.  This is ridiculous - her just showing herself in the same clip, virtually naked, over and over.  She's an adult woman with kids!
Beyonce proving to yall she is unstoppable.  Beyonce should do a country song with Nick 13 from tiger army.
Great song, pretty bad video
🤣😅🤣!!!
I. Love. This
True country music fans won’t fall for her jacked up attempt at country music and certainly isn’t country music fashion.
Yeah George strait better no offense
Not sure it suits her
This absolutely SUCKED! Stick to hip hop and taking your cloths off in that genre! Don’t be jealous of TSwift, you’re almost a billionaire be happy.
DOODOO BROWN!!!!
Ikyfl 😂😂
It's just her doing the same thing over and over again, kinda lame.
I’m a Texan and I don’t know what this is but It is NOT Country. The genre really is in need of talent but not from the tits out/fowl mouth/gutter side of other genres. Stay classy San Diego.
This Remake of the Franklin song, sucks
The music is country but her singing is most definitely NOT lol. I wouldn't call this country
Your not a country singer you got lucky now leave country to the pros
The song was robbed from the pbs hit show FRANKLIN the turtle ...if you dont believe me look it up and compare yourself
I Really love you  , who you really love you boy , maybe you don`t really love you , m-maye 😀
AI tits.
This just hits different  I don't like country music but this omg
Morgan Wallen is fire!
Calling this country is like calling enter the sandman jazz
She is never going to be country.....she needs to put clothes on
It's incredible how much this song sucks.
She stole the Franklin song...her writers r getting lazy
This is NOT country and no where near, your not a country fan if you like this… 😂
Wow, this song sucks😂. What a tragedy to music. Lol is really a horrible song
I'm sorry to say this Beyoncé but you stole this instrumental beat from the TV show called Franklin, which aired from 1997 to 2000. On top of that Beyoncé even said, if y'all remember her Destiny's Child Era, that she will never do a country song. Stick to your roots of where you came from, meaning stick with R&B which is where you got your start and quit trying to get more famous especially off of a TV show's theme song
Hate it
Hey there Franklin
Ok, so I'm only listening to this because I just found out she's trying country.......this is garbage.    She doesn't even sound country,  she just threw country-ish music in the background.
“Hey its Franklin, coming to play”
Tell me you don't get country without telling me you don't get it. This is an actual insult.
Hey its Franklin... lmao. Way to rip off a kids cartoon theme song
Great song, dumb video
I’m just here to check the song out ! African Americans are our own critics. The lady is a billionaire already 🥱  I’m sure Beyoncé know wtf she got going. In order to retire for the ones in the back. You must sing all genres of music. ❤
She's in great shape but this song is not gona make it
In the context of country music, this song fucking sucks.
Wtf, this isn't country... Had to check this song out to see what the fuss was about. Weak. And I'm sorry I ever clicked on it
Real crap right there!
Damn the song do yall see 👀 beyonce and her body sheesh😂❤❤😍😍😍
Just listen to it sounds  pretty  good to me liked it
This is not  country this is an R & B song. Country music has a banjo with a table guitar. There is content in the video that speaks of the lyrics. The video is just showing what Jay Z is not getting at home. This song is pointless and bland with no meaning or emotions. Y'all say she is so talented. I'm not seeing it and glad I have never listened to her before probably the same. Before y'all start with the R word I will ask you listen to Charley Pride that is true country talent from a black man during his time in the 60s who album went number 1 with a self portrait. The R word is just a political tactic and y'all have fallen for it.
Im addicted ❤
She is topless
the same move on loop 🤮
Wow 11m views. So beyonce is going to use her popularity  to step on actual black country artists like simeon hammond dallas, mickey guyton, renya roberts and chapel hart just to name a few.  These artists are still trying to gain acceptance and popularity in the genre.   Now we gotta hear people say stupid things like im a country fan now and credit beyonce with bringing country to blacks.
I was hoping to be impressed.  I'm not.
She killed it in this genre switchover.   Everyone doing country Now Drake is supposedly doing country…. I dunno if I can see it but we will see how he goes lol
anyone else waiting for that jacket to slip? 👀
It’s a shame country mice has came to this
Aside from Wagon Wheel, this is the only country song I can tap my foot to
Straight garbage
Isn't quite as exciting as pokerface. I can't believe none of you are complaining that little kids see her boobs or will copy style.
Hey It’s Franklin
Hey It's Franklin!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqyE-lWqCE
I like Beyonce but this is BAD!
So...... That just happened 🫤
The clip is vulgar as hell and oddly off topic. Why being 80% naked in some weird looking outfit while singing some country. Wth.
My Diva, I already remembered, I couldn't help remembering it, I don't even want to talk about it, but everything is fine here and now 😢😢😢
Country culture in the USA is a  typical WASP thing, it doesn't  "belong" to African Americans. Why is no one complaining about cultural appropation here? Where are all the cry babies ?🤨🙄
Nice tots
What trash is this
Also country music don't have its stars about to have their big fake tits falling out. What a disgrace
Really? She needed to put the song to porn?
Ripped off Kenny rogers
She did boobs and wanted so show it? 😂😂😂😂 It doesn’t look good 🥴
Country music my ass lol. Adding some whistling with an acoustic guitar does not make it country. Just because you put syrup on something don’t make it pancakes 😂😂😂 I have absolutely no problem with Beyoncé but please stick with what you have always done, there’s no denying she’s a great singer, would be idiotic to say otherwise. But, come on people, this IS NOT country 😂
Beyonce is more country than Taylor Swift
Great song shame about the vid.... you can do so much better than that!
So cringe.  Just cause it was a country song doesn't mean it had to sound like kicking boots around.  And that "whooh"   so cringy.   She might as well has said yee haw... and "dive bar?"   God. How steriotypical... from.someome boogie..like her.  🗑
YALL STOP HER GLASSES WITH THE SNAKE IS SUCH A BIG REP TV EASTER EGG SHE WENT TO THE ERAS TOUR MOVIE TOO
Nah
Wow
I really dislike that (imo) stupid  "whooo" crap in the chorus.  Love Beyonce but not this.
This crappy video
Reminds me of old Town road or some by Blanco brown
This the best shyt she put out in awhile
Country is lyrics, sound and experience.   It's a country song and I like it. Music video is boring but who cares.  For the record Black folks started country music..
The song is catchy. But I'm sorry the video is stupid.  She is dressed beyond inappropriately.
Biggest let down in her career. Acceptance should never be seeked. Her and her husband are very successful and great role models for all.
Okay what. This isn’t country . I’m a true country fan and this hun is not it. And just because it says Texas in the song doesn’t mean it country and girl ur whole boob is out
Disgusting outfit. You need a class in class
This isn't country. It's pop. Just in case ppl are confused, which it seems many are😊
Sounds like the theme song from FRANKLIN the kids show!!!!
Pure rubbish including the Illuminati signals
This is not country but I applaud her ability to make controversy to sell her music
This is ass
❤❤🎉
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY!!!!
Everyone saying you’re suddenly country fans. No you’re not. This is southern flavoured pop just like the rest of the new country on the radio.
Is this the same person that did that creepy dancing baby meme in the early 2000s? Bc that's all I see in this video.
This shit is not country.
Music video sucks, what is this??????

Dumb video and sorry stupid song. She's not country
Why in the world do they keep repeating the same scene?
Terrible clip.
Definitely Franklin theme song haha
Nothing country sounding about this.   She still sounds good but this isn’t real country music
This isent country….. Not even close
Speaking for the black community we fucking with it!!! We created county music any way we don't care if y'all like it or not Caucasians...
Hey its franklin
I like it.  It think its different, now let me check out this Franklin turtle theme song.
This is not country
a shame for that genre
Not crazy about this song as far as listening goes..guess if you’re out doing country line dancing it would be good  but not  a very good listening song😞
Of course she can sing country! She's from Houston.
Sounds like Clyde Waylon Jennings no?
She should of kept the shi😒t and bi😮😖b out of the so called country song.. 😕
This is annoying hot trash.
Can't stand most country.  Up until three minutes ago I only liked Johnny Cash, Willy Nelson, and Dolly Parton. I have no added a fourth!
This song sucks
Nice white wash
I heard beyonce went country and was like "No?"  But this checks out.    Country music still sucks btw.
🤢🤮🤮🤮
Oh no 😂😂 this is awful 😂
Like Beyonce's been in a dive bar in her life😂😂 no thanks lol stick to your pop/r&b 🤣🤣
How was she able to do a music video with so little clothes and yet it's STILL boring? 🤔 Thats skill or laziness 😂
Horrible video clip and this song does not sound country on my opinion.
I’m sorry Beyoncé, but like your other ones better
We went from hood badie to dive bar hee yaaaw haha. This isnt even country, she aint country and just putting a beat that sounds country and clothes doesnt make it country 😂😂😂😂
This isn't country...... It's literally hick hop
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ this song
I love u❤
Look at RnB trying to go country. Sad very sad
Good song but unimpressed with the video!
Franklin
Sorry, just don't like this song.
The lyrics seem to be subtly political.  Is this correct?
Sorry but a country backing track doesn't make song country
Nope!   Sexual Exploitation ✔️ Got that Robotic Megaverse & Transhumanism on deck. ✔️ Not a country song.✔️
This is not it sis.
Sounds like Franklin THE TURTLE THEME SONG!!
As a Texan and grew up on Country music this is Horrible
진짜 망극해요 .. mama.. 🏞 🌬💧
Stick with R&B because you suck at country music. This is horrible. You need to fire everyone involved.
This aint no damn country what the hell.
I'm sorry but this doesn't sound anything like country music
Doing the whole one eyed thing.... Find Christ ✝️
Give Beyonce a damn drink already.
Omgosh
Not impressed
This is not country music. This is just Beyonce making country music noises.
well this SUCKS!!!
What a bunch of shit! Country don't think so!😅
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" is challenging for a 2nd week at #1 on the Hot 100! Keep buying, streaming on ALL platforms, and requesting radio play! 👑🐝
I like this
Nice song Crappy, boring video
So everyone is saying ahe stole this song from an old Cartoon intro?
I love the Franklin tv show theme
Let’s just say this video make Franklin crawl out of his shell.
No
That is not a country song
Gives country a bad name why do you have to show your tits and everything else
that's an awful video
This song feels raging inauthentic. Which I guess makes it a perfect fit to be a chart topper for country music these days.
I was a Beyoncé fan, but then she did this stupid shit
Sorry.. but this is desperately cheap trash trying to keep up with the young ones like Madonna. Stay classy. Get rid of Jay Z and be yourself. Don’t let him control you. We can see it in your hopeless eyes. Also is your stylist copying Kanye? The outfit is just embarrassing for someone many consider “queen “. So sad to see this.
When you want to cosplay every musical genre.
This is what y'all r calling country now?i dont fkn think so..
Que bosta de clip kk tá bem falida a beyonce
This is ridiculous. Is this an actual song? Actual video?
Nah it sounds like simple bar music yal are tripping. No hate to her but this is crap
Song is great but missed the mark on the video
The music is very good but the videoclip is a joke😢
Wtf😂 is this
_You go girl!_
These people in the comments aren't real Country music fans they just here to listen to Bey
Love the song...and love Beyonce...but is it just me or does this song sound more like Tracy Chapman?
the Kenyan and Big Mike are doing the two step to this tune...
Definately NOT Texas ...  more like L.A., California.
Damn I want to know what doctored did her chest! This is great advertisement for him or her..
Is the vest the reason this song is so popular?
Did the edit her nips out ?
This is not country. Trashy
This song is to country what special Olympics is to the actual Olympics.  It’s not even close to being good country.  Put a pop beat with a twang to it and it would be “fine”  She has as much talent as the producers, songwriters, and choreographers give her.
If this country then I'm hip hop as shit 😂
Coming thru with her JOANNE ERA!!!
Some people are saying this song sounds like Bruce Cockburn's theme song to Franklin, but personally I don't hear any resemblance at all. It's an ok song but I'm not going to rush out and buy it.
This is wack af....also, this is not really country music. it sounds like pop country...this will flop hard af.
class tune this
I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and why people don't like this song.  I like some of her music and I think she is talented,  however I don't think this genre suits her vocal style and skills.   This song doesn't embrace the essence of a country song at all. I guess she wanted to try something new.
Video meeting * What if we just did a loop of 18 seconds of Beyonce's boobs almost popping out of an open black leather vest, then her finger tracing up between her boobs and then she fake shoots bang bangs off her fingers"....  All male group "That tracks"
Girl why was I actually dancing to this it’s a bop
Barf.
Selling sex" that's it' nothing" other for guys.. 👀 big bunch of nothing- i like dancing..
Is that the whole video?
This is a country song if country music was hood!
This has to be a joke 😂😂
Is this a actual song. Doesn't sound like any thought was put into the lyrics. This shit sucks ass.
Not a good song, don't like it but gave it a shot
I gotta say this sucks cover your self up i dont see other country singers half naked
I like the song but the video sucks,very disappointing
It sucks and she needs some clothes on.
Well she didn’t have to spend a whole lot on filming. But love the song.
Not my cup of tea but props to her for branching into a different genre!
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
🪩🪩🪩
❤❤❤❤❤
BeyHive! Beyonce has now reached a new peak of 65 million monthly listeners on Spotify! 👑🐝
Sounds like she ripped off the theme song from the children's cartoon, Franklin
Learn how to sing. That sounds horrible
Hey, it’s franklin!
Wtf kinda video is this 😂😂😂
This is the dumbest song I’ve ever heard
Love country❤❤❤music
This is Pop Country. I don’t remember Country being this revealing of clothing😂 Country is more classy than this😂😂
She said Texas and it’s a country song? Come on. Stay in your lane, Bey. Naked and pointing your finger gun isn’t country.
😂😂😂😂😂 TRASH!!!! WHAT ARE EMBARRASSMENT TO ACTUAL COUNTRY ARTISTS!! Nice try Beyonce but you're still not going to get album of the year just throw the towel in already
Don't listen to Beyonce but needed to know if she did indeed copy Franklin. Yes
Sluttier the better  😂
❤🎉🎉
Boring
This is not a country song
This shit is not country 😂😂
You really hit the Texas folks in the right spot❤❤❤  Love from Bulawayo Zimbabwe Africa 🦋
Hey it's Franklin.  Coming over to plaaaaaay.  Hey it's Franklin.
I don’t know who she’s trying to impress, but it’s not working for me! Country music is Reba McEntire, George Strait, etc. etc. this is not country music!!
This shit is ass. So mono tone
Boring Yawn 🥱
queen ❤
She should have been dressed in county Western.  Clothes and hat and boots
Doesn’t sound like country at all, saying Texas in a song does not make it country.
I don't understand how this song is so popular. I keep hearing it everywhere, so I thought I'd stop by and give it a chance. Maybe it's just because "its Beyonce", but this isn't good.
What da hell u wearing?
Watched to see what the hype is about.  Not a Beyonce hater but If this was not Beyonce, it would not make any hit chart.  Not a fan of the video either.  Can't they think of something other than sexy walk for a video?    Not for me.
Liking the tights round the wrong way lol I do that, and half my woohoo  is off down the street 😂😂😂
So would this be considered cultural appropriation now since black people say that white people in hip-hop are vulture Rising the culture I think Nick Cannon called Iggy Azalea a culture vulture
This ain’t country, but neither is most of what’s on “country radio” these days.  I love Beyoncé and this song is catchy.  You want a black country artist that’s actually country, check out Dirt Road and other stuff by RVSHVD.
First off not country music and second put on some clothes and I felt like I was in the twilight zone watching her continually walk out doing the same finger gun. God 3 minutes of my life I can never get back. This song is horrible
🤮🤮🤮
This is disgusting! First of all, maybe a pair of boots, tight jeans and t shirt... no need to turn country music into a slot show. And this "country song" is actually wack, I only listened long enough to write this... and my ears bled the whole time.
And right here Beyoncé entered her desperation era
Hey franklin...🐢
Yah sure know how to dick ride, this song is garbage, but you know Beyoncé fans, they will love her cuz they have no authentic lives themselves just like their idol and snake
Good sound!!! Love it!!
This is not real country 😢plz don’t ruin country for us.
I’m sorry but do they use the same clip of her running her finger up her stomach to her boobs the only thing that is shown? Low value entertainment….
Not country but definitely beyonces best work
This is not country!!! You want country listen  to Reba McIntyre &  The Judds. That's country music!!!! This song sucks and her other one My House sucks too!!!
Came here to find out what the rave was all about with Beyoncé’s country song…  what an insult to all actual country artists
What the fuck is this shit 😂 this isn’t country fucking music
Soon will be song to western movies...
Beyoncé e magnífica em qualquer Stilo,amei essa country❤🇧🇷🐝
Terrible
Reminds me of “Pontoon”-catchy! Stupid video tho!!
Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (also known as "honky-tonk music") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and many types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator guitars). So tell me how this ain’t country music again 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️ can’t beat black history 😋
"Well, if you can't beat Taylor, might as well join her original genre." (Jay-z, when asked to comment on Beyonce latest project)
ביונסה רוזנלום קיסרית אמפרורית ארכי דוכסית של פאלו אלטו, קופרטינו וסאן פרנסיסקו וסאן חואן. מלכת אפריקה ומערב אירופה אמריקה לא תהיה קיימת. הבנות והנכדות שלי היו בנות 25❤.
I like the song!! Good for her.  (The costume is horrific though. )
Rather listen to a cat chokin up a hairball and tryin to shit a razor blade
Don't get me started on the outfit choices.  But what good is a video if it's the same 20 seconds on constant repeat...
Beyonce having two kids. Why is she wearing clothes looking like that?
I love a bit of country ❤
I don't like it
Jimmy Butler cadê você ?
It’s too bad this video is so sexualized—another great talent sold out.
Shes been wearing her cowoy hat everywhere but when it comes to the video she doesnt. DUMB.   Song is danceable..but all sje does is walk and shoot flames from fingers. LAME.  Cover up your breast implants
This is not country😂
I loveeeee this song
Not a country song at all  WTF!!!!!!
WHAT A STUPID VIDEO.  NOTHING COUNTRY ABIUT IT.   NOW SHE DOESNT WEAR HER COWBOY HAT
That is not country if anything that’s an insult to country music
Wow! What a amazing choreographed video!
I'm a big Beyoncé fan , but lately....🫤
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY LOL THIS BEYONCÉ TRYING TO WIN SOMETHING LOL
Get this shit outta here the fuck lol
This is ridiculous.
Man, I just love this tune, what an unbelievable star Beeonsay is.. h'yuk
Cultural inappropriate
So glad I'm not under the spell of R&B, pop, and hip hop music anymore, because I'd probably like this mediocre crap too. Plus they added the allure of Beyonce and a little cussing because for some reason black people feel like it's "real" when cussing is allowed.🤦🏾‍♂️ I just wanted to see what the fuss was, but I'm sorry this is very basic.
Lame...half naked wanna be cowgirl now!? Over Beyonce... Dumb song.
french canadian irish  breton creole , Acadia to louisiana
this isn't country music
Ppl forget that Beyonce is from Texas  I like her song
hahahahahahahahahahaha!
Thank you very much for going Country! ! ! ❤ Your most definitely Loyal mega Super V Fan!
HEYYY ITS FRANKLIN
Ridiculous video no real great country singer would do that and she is not
Ehh c est frankliin 🎶🎶🎶
Hmm
I mean this is a fun pop song, but not really "country". Come at me all you want. 😏
What a terrible song and video! That bang and twang sound is not country!
Heeeeeyyy it's Franklin ❤
put clothes on and take cussing out of song - horrible example for young girls who look up to Beyonce
Will Beyonce continues to prove me right every day. This woman is a total joke and a complete ball of garbage. Every song she has socks and this one is no different. Doesn't even sound like a legit country song, just a money grab. I'm a country fan and this is definitely hot trash just like the person singing it and everything she touches
Alright let me do the country fans a favor here. If you don't do country music or listen to it constantly. If you made your entire career in pop music. Stay in that don't try to leave and go to country or rock music. It's actually an insult to use that  actually listen to country and rock music. Ask lil Wayne he will tell you rock is hard to get into because rock fans like certain things. I know country music fans are the same way. Steven Tyler had to learn the same lesson as well. You can try and be a poser but you won't attract anyone that actually listens to this music. The ONLY people who will actually listen to this song are the same people who already listen to her music. Just like lil Wayne learned you can't just pick  up a guitar and  lay out some chords. Then expect to make a rock song that people will like. See what most people don't understand is it's easy to rap or make pop songs. Using the guitar to make country music or rock songs takes A lot more skill. This isn't just me saying it. Lil Wayne actually said the same thing. He said that rock fans humbled him because his rock album was utter crap. Even Steven Tyler is learning this because compared to Aerosmith his new stuff is terrible. For country music you gotta have a draw to match the songs. Zz top is actually a good example of it. They use their music to match their voice. I know in the rock genre we don't listen to this crap because we don't betray the one that worked their asses off to get there.
This song is dog shit
Yeah, NO!
Wow this is horrible.
Sounds like gospel not country.
Beautiful voice ❤
How is this country? Lol.
What she mean this ain’t Texas? This is always Texas around here! Nice song still think you are strange.
I love this song
So Beyonce is copying Shakira… got it
I luv her but i dont get this video🤔🤔🤨
I'm not a big Beyonce fan but I LOVE THIS SONG
😂 Cant believe people actually think this is good or even country.
When she drops an acoustic version bruh, won’t be no question about country
This is the song everyone is on about? Terrible. She's a great singer, but the song isn't for me to say the least
I reckon you can hear me 👍
I love this song, but the video is a little strange with nothing going on but her boobs!
The video?  NOPE
This video is stupid, she could’ve made such a cute one for this song, this is just lazy
Why she have to dressed like that?! You don't see country women singers coming out half butt naked! This doesn't sound country at all! And she can't carry a tune in this song! Stick with what you know Beyoncé
Why is she dressed like a stripper?  That doesn't go with the song, but the song is okay.
garbage total garbage
🖤 .. 😏👌
Tits everywhere
Hey it's Franklin!
Sorry but this isn't country.
This song sucks ass
This is horrible she needs to stick to pop music god please no more😮😮😮
didn't beyonce used to be black?!
Hahahahhhah😂😂😂😂
Couldn’t she have done a more Creative video?
My daughter loves it she’s almost two in Aug
Juste Beyoncé pouvait faire ça et c'est fu*king Groovie
NOOOOOOOO!
I just cannot get with todays music. I dont understand how this is country. I mean i cant stand country and i cant stand this song so its got a lot in common. Only reason im here is because i seen its on the top 100 or some crap and didnt know what it was.
This is terrible
Franklin producers should sue, before Jay Z goes ranting this is the best song in the world and she needs a grammy
Everybody Loves Franklin!
Wonderful 🥰
love this song so much
This definitely sounds like Franklin’s theme song
https://youtu.be/_gLuKnGbAR8?si=XsnGcy4yqhua2BJH lyrics 🔥💯
Ok. I love country. It’s my fave.  Beyoncé…I recommend you STAY AWAY FROM COUNTRY AND STICK WITH WHAT YOUR GOOD AT. this isn’t even real country! This is like just more pop with a slightly western beat. And just bc you’re talking about Texas doesn’t mean it’s country. I don’t mean to hate, but stay away from country. Keep up what you know you can do.
Is Disney making country music now
im so confused rn
This is crap!
i love that the franklin theme song creator praised bey and shut y’all up once and for all lmao.  it’s sad people have to keep defending her cause y’all stay lying and discrediting her. i wish folks could just enjoy things without starting drama.
Solargenic, photogenic, shoot 💥
Whoever says this is country needs to go listen to brooks and dunn or Alan Jackson cuz this is far from it
Pour some sugar on me 🍭🍬🍫
She needs to stick to the music she does, even tho it's crappy
I love this song
This is HORRIBLE 😂I'm second hand embarrassed smh
Why did I know she’d come out half naked😝 stay in your lane.  This doesn’t even sound right. ❌ why tho??
What a message!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
The most boring video clip i saw in my entire life ...its .... Its....soooooo f boring ,the song good ok ,they are so many more songs like rhis wich are better they just dont have jay z and the millions to push em
this song is stupid sorry
What happened to Epstein island anything to say about it ??
😍😍😍
Is that it video
Weirdest video ever -songs ok
Wierd video for Beyoncé she usually puts more into her videos,,, I guess because she didn’t have any backup dancers or anything she making purrrre profit off this video!!! I think she realized she doesn’t need to pay all those people,,, but she has the money to pay and help others get ahead in life I’m so confused,,, the videos I’ve seen surfacing the internet are better then this video,,, maybe she was giving a opportunity for Tiktoc dancers to put there own spin on it!!! 😊
Get some dam clothes on! No self respect anymore!!!
THIS ISNT COUNTRY !!!!
None of this makes sense to me. It's country, but it ain't Texas, there a Lexus and she looks like a Pirate taking hip hop????? Daddy's Issues was on the money. Beyonce had serious cash from 16...she wants to talk Dive bars??? Who write this bullshit??
I firnly believe that the only reason thia has gotten into the charts, is because it's Beyonce.  If someone unknown released this, it would be panned... It's barely country
Nice music but the video is disgusting
this does sounds like the Franklin theme song!!
all the hypocrisy of shitty america - white person wears beads and dreadlocks and all of the sudden it is cultural appropriation....but when a black person sings a country music then its ok
I want too walk in her footsteps.
If this is Country, I am Alan Jackson.
I know she"s Beyonce and she's hot MILF. But dressing like this needs to come with trigger warning.LOL.and this single cover like wtf, so NSFW...love the song btw.
I’m not into country, this song is brilliant. Bravo.
Absolute fucking garbage!!
I AM TRULY IMPRESSED ONLY SHE COULD HAVE PULLED IT OFF👍🤠
The vid? That's it? 😢 They don't wear clothes anymore😮
Oops. Her mask got broken - only one eye showing. It reminds me of something…I guess the answer will be illuminated later.
Wrong outfit
I'm we in country don't dress like whores
ADD A COMMENT, WRITE A COMMENT, WRITE A PUBLIC COMMENT, COMMENT AS DERICKO COOPER @VÀLEE MUSIC 🎶🎶🎼🎤🎶🎼🎤🎼🎤🎼🎤🎼🎤🎼🎤🎼🎤
This is not country. It’s a cities, check, thinking what country is.
Taylor, Miley and now Beyonce, they are all crap Country Music singers, it shouldnt be hard for a Black person to write and sing Country Songs, Country music isnt that far removed from Rap and Blues.
I'm pretty open to all genres and while this has a good beat it doesn't change the fact that she was talking about how much she didn't like white women when Jay was cheating with "becky" like it was our problem. Now shes going to country ? This song only has a chorus that's repeated to sound like an actual song but what is the point of the video? All she is doing is standing in a room with a green screen in body suits. There is no reason for the song to be called texas hold em or even have any hint of texas. I am from texas this is not how they dress or act. She needs to stick to making music out of new York this is not her style
i liked Beyoncé's music
~ 🫒Thanks for creating something "wholesome" for the kids. Keep it up and watch the consistant downfall of your black communities.  You should love your people more, just look how they've changed since the 1940's to now. We used to dress beautifully and children jump roped in the streets and now the children mimic the ground you walk on    Care more...sorry kind of.   You are powerful , do better.
I think you could have done more with this video as the country has an awakening an appreciation to country music  great job on the song
Stick to your side of the road gurl
What in the name of all that is good and holy?!?!?! Some things just shouldn't ever happen especially in the name of money, popularity or tryina out do Taylor. This is wrong
Nope. Swipe left. Absolute trash.  Stay in your lane before Aaron Lewis comes w the lynch mob
One listen everyone knows the rules, 0.1, no
Can’t  stop listing ❤

Stolen: Franklin TV cartoon theme song
Yuk 😅
How is this even considered country ?
Idk why this song reminds me  of "Franklin The Turtle" cartoon song.
Yall know , u wouldn’t , pay $5 for this song .. click it , cuz yall know it’s true ,  be only doin this to make money ,she. Dont wanna go country .. but , when , Taylor swift is , the global icon , Queen b , gotta do something 😅
Here comes Franklin!
So proud of you
There is absolutely nothing special about this song.
❤
meh. doesnt have anything catchy a country song would have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG2jMm7ku50
She coming for that Country Grammy and she needs to be holding one for sure ❤❤❤❤
Mild
Someone said that people are racist to Beyonce 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Continuing into the gutter we go...  This is junk and making fun of an entire genre of music, how are people this dumb?
This aint country...NO NO NO....insult to true texans.
The sound is kind of catchy.
That was awful, that’s not country music.
Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) vibes...this country but still sasha fierce
Real country lovers know whats up. I could never see her riding horses, or going fishing. She'd prob break a nail. I am not worried.
This actually sucks
No, just no.
Oh yeah she is my favorite
Night ray, Contro, Beyoncé worst song ever it’s a no for me
She need to run
Sorry, toots, you just show your body.Bleach yourself white in a scene and make sure to show your ass! Not country at all. I guess you missed a huge part about producing a video in the country genre! Hats off to Tracy Chapman! Her song of 36 years is now recognized as country thanks to her performance!!! Schneider was right. Pissing on pole!!😅
Ridiculous vulgar outfit.
Not even close, the Beat and Melody is good but Beyonce is terrible, Taylor would make this a Banger for sure
This is not county
I like your song!! Is this all you do, is stand there and touch your yourself. I do not get it.. 😊 Not a dane.......
Is this R&B getting back at the country singers for trying to rap?
Pure garbage listen to some David Allan Coe now that's country
Didn’t know it was Beyoncé singing this…. I like it ..
She sucks at country music. Just stop. She was only any good when she was with destinys child.
Worse attempt at country music ever.
Hey Franklin…
This ain't real country. She's using the word B**** and other "ghetto" stuff. Ridiculous. Smh and look how she's dressing lol that definitely ain't country.
Trash 🗑
This is NOT country music!!!!!!!! Just like all country music now. This country pop. Which isn’t country music! Never been her fan. All her songs sound the same . She needs just retire, share her wealth with our crumbling society and be a mom to her kids.
She’s desperate, there’s nothing country about this
Why the nudity 😣 we all can see you through 🙈🙊
🤦🏻
Well, that was a little underwhelming. I mean, if the song is country (even if the lyrics are making fun of country music), at least put a little bit more into the production of the video. Oh, wait. It's Beyonce. If she wants to sit back and do the bare minimum and still hit #1 on the country charts, fine. Apparently, she can tell us to go to hell, and we'll love the journey😂
Here after Joe budden pod kept playing it lol
Lumineers been robbed  Franklin the turtle been robbed
Oh yes, the other Taylor Swift
Made a crappy country song and ripped off a kid's show theme song at the same time 😂😂😂
"Beyoncé ain't country", period!! this song is crap. and her FAN'S knows it, desperate for attention, only way was due to Toby Keith's Passing, Sad Blow BeyONCE, No Class, all trash!  called Pop!
Wow, that's crap and sounds exactly like all of her other music
This is total shit, she probably figured to be half naked to hold the attention of the crowd,, with a voice like hers some Motown blues would be very impressive, keep her clothes on and put out some music with class,,,, sorry.....
CARNIVAL better
okie dokie  beyonce what the flip.
Ugg....the sound of a dog shitting
Is everyone getting paid for these comments? lol. This song is horrible and the video is too. Seriously putting trashy lyrics into country music. Trying so hard to be where Taylor is and I’m not even a fan of her either
Honk colonizer music
Fake 😂
Left eye left arm y'all know?
Left eye shit
Alan Jackson’s song gone country is coming true
She just ruined country music!!!
She’s using the “Franklin the Turtle” theme song. 22:38
Crap
Is this a country song??
Why the constant need to look slutty?
Anyone else more willing to call this folk, over country
What part of the south is that outfit from? 😂
This ok but not really good 😕 it's always like that with her tunes she has her fans cult of personality I guess
Isn’t this Franklin the Turtle theme? Skank ass thief
More nude
Get into it yuh❤
Give her a grammy for best album already so we can move on 🙄
This proves that if an artist is loved, they can put out any kind of genre: pop, country, whatever ... and it will be accepted. That's good for the music industry.
Good…song is boring af.
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Wtf
Ay ahora que México esta arrazando ahora si quieren ser vaqueros y hablar de texas
Not a true country lady for sure not from TEXAS❤❤❤
This sucks this not country
She don't belong in country music
It's the worst shit I've ever heard
Song  great , outfit not….
Stick to pop music.
I have always loved country but this is to much
This isnt country.. its also stolen music from a cartoon turtle's show
I like the song, but the video is lame.
She held her hands up like baphomet...whole time. One eye illuminati....y'all worship anything. This is sad and disturbing.
I like it.  👍
that is not country music. it is shit
NOT A FAN , AND I LOVE COUNTRY ‼️
Hey it’s Franklin!!
What does having no clothes on have to do with this song?  That chic is wicked to the core.
Doesn't sound good or country. NOPE
This pop music
Pass
Country shows are going to get alot Wilder!!  ~Twerk and line damcing~
This video is mind control. Quit praising and idolizing liars and creeps.
I love your music you are my Queen. I love this song ❤❤❤❤❤💙.
This? Country? I grew up in a small town of 3,500 people, she grew up in the big city of Houston. We drove lawn mowers to the hardware store or walked everywhere. We have worked hard with our two hands, manual labor. She probably has never picked up a tool in her life. People This ISNT country. This is a white collared lady who heavily relies on Hollywood to create a false image of country. Just because your from Texas doesn't automatically make you country girl. Leave it to the REAL country girls, we like to get dirty, work hard, love Jesus, and don't need no fancy hollywood gimmics!
I like the song but the video sucks!
I thought the video would be more country dancing.
What a weird video. very repetitive. I give it a meh. Music isn't real creative these days. Too corporate. Won't say it's not a toe tapper, though. I hope she keeps on with the country path and takes it by storm. I just think the video could've been way more creative. Videos used to tell like whole stories. Member berries MJs Moonwalker? That was dope. November Rain, G&R. Sad, but a great experience, and Boys2Men videos had the whole 90s in a clutch wanting to be loved. Lol.
Wow that is terrible.
Booo! If this is what you got to do to sell records... I'm not interested! All you see her is her selling  herself... like a chick in the night .. how can you really listen to the music . This is a porn Ground Hogs Day... please  make a decent remake of this song... with clothes  on!
I read somewhere that this song sounds a lot like the Franklin theme song, and now I can't unhear it! 😂
I like the song but the video leaves a lot to desire (no pun intended).
Guys, this isn’t even country music in the least bit.. stop.
She needs to retire from the spot light
Heyy its Franklin coming to myy house
This is not country people. Yuk.
It's official. Worst country song ever.
This song is over hyped. Its not even a great country song. I wouldnt even consider it country music. I cant stand how everyone jumps on the beyonce bandwagon. 🙄
This is not country it’s crap 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This is not country..love her voicetho❤❤❤
Just found out this is a rip off of the Franklin cartoon theme song .i.ll be dam!!!
I can't believe Jay-Z gets to hit that 😩
I don’t like country but            This makes me             Still           Don’t           Like it.
Im not a big Fan of Beyonce, I think she is very overrated. But i do like this
😮if you want the benefit of home made shots you need to make them every single day not in one time and drink it immediately right after juicing extracting otherwise is just water 🙁
Jesus Christ loves you so much and He died for you!!
Is this a cover
What I wouldn't do for a night...
Lol,  people who were raised in the country... dont find this to be country music.. tf.. 😅
Her voice is obviously always good. The lyrics sound AI generated though... Or at least written by someone who has only experienced the south through a screen
Love the song, but this video is boring and slutty.
BEYONCE QUEEN ❤❤🔥🔥
I didn't know she was singing ..I got distracted
What are they takng bout we blaks created country too. They always hating. But her lips are💋 not moving, though. 😁😆😅🤣😂
No Beyonce... Just no. Stay in your lane!!!
?
Love it 🎉❤
The fk this have to do with Poker? Fk outta here.
This is the most boring song I’ve ever heard in my life.. this AI is wild
Legends would say it's thanks to "LES JONES"
Old Canadian tune, I m not impressed, & what's with being half naked!!
Absolutely horrendous. Simon from American idol would even agree. Whoever says this is the best country doesn’t not know country.
“HEY ITS FRANKLIN”
Is this all there is to her video?? THE WORST!!!
This music video is so boring/gay retarded stupid (I need a vowel) if the song wasn’t as good as it is I honestly think it’d be a MAJOR FLOP!!
She needs to cover up
This is trash.  If this is what country music is coming to then they have totally lost me. 😢
Why was it so hard to hear this song on you tube? White gay guy asking... this was good. ❤😊
Boring 😴😴😴😴😴
Talk about no effort for the video
I am not country music but I am digging this
We love you girlll
cultural appropriation
This isn’t country. This is mainstream
Y’all gonna hate this but this shitt trash her music sucks now she’s past her prime facts are facts
🗑
Yay Beyonce here to corrupt country music.  What a stupid song!
Just because you add a banjo to the music don't make it country. She's not even singing it like a country song sounds more like r&b. People should just stick to what they know!
Fun song, video is repetitive.
The clip IS ALL the se shit?
Be classy like Taylor, hire dancers of all races.
It's a good song but can't she wear clothes?  No class
God aweful. I wanna know who's responsible for writin these.nonsensical.lyrics(?). Lmao. Those.mixed with the Franklin song...yea, perfecto .😅😅😅 trash .
Shes just trying to make Country trashy... She ain't authentic... Just because she's from Texas. I rather listen to the one country singer I hate the most cause he's racist(David Allen Coe) then to listen to her devil worshipping self.😂😂😂
Bey proving you don't need to be White or play geetar to do country  🤠🤣
Nothing like sampling from a cartoon. 😂
Not a fan of
Hilarious
I don’t really listen to country music but I love this!!!❤
This song is 🔥 ‼️... so i cant be surprise by the people who said it was horrible...you know what they look like. ⚪️👀
The video sucks
So degrading and disgusting this isn't COUNTRY. THIS IS TRASH
I don't like this song at all. She is not a country singer.
I like the song (I'm from Texas) but the video sucks.
She ripped off the song redneck women!!!!
Beyonce is such a versatile singer.  Her next recording release could be anything - Opera, Heavy Metal, Death Metal, Acid Rock, Alternative, Broadway Classics, Jazz, Punk  - whatever suits her.  👍😍🤩
Some of y’all hating but we’re at #1 on billboard🥱
I have no words for how bad this song is. This is not country music.
Someone said this sounds like the Franklin cartoon theme 🤣 I hear it
What’s with this outfit?? She’s a has-been and dressing like this for attention doesn’t make the song better. It doesn’t justify her husbands whining at the Grammy’s. And doesn’t she have a daughter? This is what she wants her to look up to??   And yes, it does sound like the Franklin theme song. 🙄
Hey, it’s Franklin!
Sounds like a beat from a different song. Personally i don’t like it.
So what the song is amazing 🤩😍
It's catchy, Definitely can line dance to it... Just not sure if it's... A country song... Remember boot scoot and boogie.. To  me that's an example of a line dancing song. I was taught line dancing in my gym class, very rural area. But to me that's more line dancing.. A country song and a line dancing song are just different. I see people saying country song... Yeah but no... I guess it just depends on how you look at it❤❤❤ Love you beyonce
If you have to be half naked to sell a song, your song aint' no good! Cher was never this revealing!
This shit is garbage.
Um...I like Beyonce, but this doesn't sound like country music to me....and pretending to fire a gun doesn't change that. Just sayin'....
Worst song ever.
Why dress like that? Song is good,better to put some clothes on
bro this sucks 💀
You can't just slap some banjo and fiddle on a beat and call yourself country. The lyrics are pretty cliche. But this is still the first thing I've kinda liked by Beyonce in a while.
Sounds like Franklins the turtle theme song
Beyoncé looked so damn sexy
Theme song from Franklin the Turtle😂😂
🤮
Such trash
Beyoncé , you are so inspiring, creative and simply amazing. Thank you❤❤❤❤
This is worse than Wild Wild West by Will Smith… it’s not country. It’s cliche sounding bull shit.
Catchy, but more pop than country, like all of country nowadays. The video? I like it.
This is not county. Culture vulture
no
Bee this sounds like a gospel song! Need work on the country accent  but the instrument sound pretty country just the singing style needs work coz it ain't sound country to me personally.
Oh hell no ! Whose stupid idea was this?!?!
This is about as Country as a Billboard in Times Square... Stick with Pop Beyonce.
love!! its very catchy!!
Not a bad song, but it ain't country.
Sucks
The song is good….but the video is definitely lacking.
That too bad for white people the one’s that’s Jealous,,, She has the best of both worlds in music She is byracial Soul Sista,,, She is a mixed woman on her mother Side,,, God Created that and nobody Can’t Do anything about it,,,
This ain’t country
I love how White Conservative are clutching their Confederate Pearls at this video and song.  LOOOOOL   If anything makes me smile from ear to ear is having White Right Wingers be uncomfortable.
This is the most rediculous mix to country/ pop mix. I will never listen to this terrible song... as a long time and same aged listener. Absolutely terrible.
Like Beyoncé, like the song, LOVE the outfit…dumbest music video in the history of music videos
Ugliest song ever. That does NOT sound country. Sounds like a chorus at a black church
This is evil
Is this the music video???? If so, terrible!
I'm not getting country...
I like it!
This is not country 💀💀💀
I know we’re all obligated to say this is good because it’s Beyonce, but let’s be honest, this is horrible 😄😄
She doesn’t have the voice for country songs
So , she like the porn look for her not so country song
So not her! Doesn't sound or look right and dumb video.
How is this country? Also she’s a mom, she needs to cover up ffs
Nothing country about this song
Beyoncé I like country music; don't ruin every genre. Please learn from the lyrics of Maddie and Taye- Girl in a Country Song 🎵
Not a Bey fan, but has she always had fake boobs?
So many bots jus to outshine taylor gtfoh ITS TRASH
#Beyonce this ain’t Texas
Ahahhahahahah Franklin's theme song 🤣🤣
Not being a hater. But  her song ain't  country.  Bc doesn't have mud fishing  or trucking  or drinking. And  the outfits where city
This is not country music people do not know what country music is any the music on prime country is real country music this is  Embarrassing.
This certainly is a modern country song
I prefer the Franklin Theme song better. but the T's are nice touch
Yall disappointing .......cant be anti america and make country music thats like being anti black making rap.
Love a lot of her music but personally not a fan of this, I don't feel anything from it, very little emotion. But her voice is great.
The song is OK. She want be Charlie Pride or Dolly Parton,,but the video sucks
This video has zero creativity.
Johnny Cash has to talk to this women.
I am a strong fan of country music and i think this is a disappointment to our way of life city people can stay in the city 🤷🤷
Franklin....is that you? What the heck did I just watch?
Garbage 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
This ain't even close to country.
Sorry, this is not country. It's trashy.     Betsy Kiein, Loretta, Dolly, Shania - all country, all classy.
No matter what style she chooses it will just be great Beyoncé is the queen
What a gross video and cover! What an insult to country music. Shame on any country station that's plays this s*&t!
If this is country - King Strait is Elton John 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
NO NO NO THIS IS SAD please stay away from country music do not ruin my favorite music
lol her OF ad.
Absolute garbage.  She should stick to the garbage age usually puts out.
NOPE
This is so awful.  It sounds like someone who knows nothing about country music. Made a country music song.
I wouldn't even call this country.  Not.Even.Close.  And I'm not a country fan.  Not sure how this made to the top though.
How this went to the top of the charts I do not know. No class!
This sucks hard!
Franklin the turtle…. Alll imma say 🤷‍♂️
This song is garbage
Finally a decent song by Beyonce where she isn't screeching
franklin ah beat
Love the song but what the hall is she wearing?! She looks ridiculous 😂🤣
Sempre al top
Slayinggggg
Nice song but the video sucks pond water
Its a song for all the woo-girls! At least they will become easier to spot on the dance floor.😂
This song sucks!!!! What a joke and a stupid video. Stay in your LANE!!!!!
Now this is what I remember country music sounded like, before it adopted a more pop music sound. We need a whole album like this.
You ripped off the "Franklin the turtle" cartoon theme song
🇧🇷
Nah this is trash Beyonces music is horrible now I miss her old music
Stupid song
It's a no for me
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Doesn't this remind anyone besides me of the opening of The Rolling Stones "Prodigal Son"?
Hahahahaha that’s horrible
Every piece using a banjo: Hey, this is Franklin's Theme! Honestly, people... Even the guy that wrote the song said it isn't a copy.
Your song is the best one I’ve ever heard
Trash every song copied from ben franklin  Turtle song sounds better
The song does not give me any feelings its so boring she had to put more soul in it i think michel would rock it she had better voice beyonce only got the looks
Humanity has most definitely by some definition moved beyond some age of innocence.
If these eyes are not mistaken this woman appeared out of darkness a total of 1 and 4 times!    My guess is most male eyes were not counting the number of times things have appeared out of darkness right before their eyes!
What's with this clip
when you sell your soul to the evil, he makes all your dreams come true, because he has power in all sectors of this earth.
Nothing country about that shit don't sound like George Jones or Merle haggard to me
🤮😂😂😂😂 go away please!! Stay away from country music please 🙏🙏🙏
That song is the intro of a Canadian cartoon!  Franklin the turtle 😂 Can't even create her own shit 😂😂😂
A maior!!❤
Genuinely asking, why do you guys like this song? I don’t think anyone could come up with something more generic if they tried
This was very good
Feels like its missing something. I wont say beyonce can't  do a country song. But this is not it lol.
I mean it's not a great song, it's ok but what gets me is the cultural appropriation....how come she can do it and not be called racist but if a white person raps it's a sin 🤷🏼‍♂️ #doublestandards
not a fan of the song /:
Bless her little heart ❤️!
QUEEN!!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
This is dukie
the reason she made this song is because she has every song reward except for the country reward :)
Taint a country song if it doesn't mention getting drunk, pickup trucks, trains and Mama.
THIS IS SO BAD...ESPECIALLY THE STUPID AND OBSCENE VIDEO OF HER HALF NAKED!!! The song isn't even good, basically the same sentence over and over. Please... just because it is Beyonce?? She needs to go back to doing her girl band stuff.
Sasha fierce, aka Beyonce, is literally killing the country music vibe with its non country singing voices! I would like to see chris Gains, aka garth brooks and Sasha Fierce. Do a Duet on stage at the good old opera house!"  What a devilish site that would be!
Put some clothes on. Ridiculous outfits. Maybe Chapel Hart will get more recognition now. Pitiful that they have gotten almost nothing but this gets hyped and applauded.
I just wish she would’ve danced to the song… she is so awesome ❤
Uhhhh… what?
As a fellow 90s kid that was poor and the bunny ears picked up pbs we know this song 😂😅
All those bitching against her even trying to release country - and her ass from Texas!
She sounds awful she's no country singer she needs to stick  with the music she always sings and dressing like that . She should be ashamed of herself.
Thought she was against guns and she does a video with shooting Hippocrates
The fact that this reached number 1 anywhere only proves that people's taste these days is in their colon.
Not country
Not country lol
The fact she's from houston texas it fits her voice I could see as a commercial
Love the song but everyone is moving to the song but her
This sounds just as much country as the other "country music" out there now. So... I don't see why people are making a fuss.
Since when does a country boy drive a Lexus?
She should at least wear a fancy bra in case,she looks cheap.
Yeah, she isn't a good role model for little girls unless you want to educate them about grooming and how to defend themselves from users.
This video is so disappointing 😞
Ad a Texan this is so relatable
That's garbage.  Sorry.  Stick to a genre that you know.  Country isn't it.
I like the music and her voice. Not sure how "country" a song could be when it's telling you to stop acting like you're country and start acting like Beyonce, though. Glad you can find some sense to that. To me, it sounds like mockery of an entire way of life.  And, I'm not country. I do have respect for that way of life, though. If she wants to mock it, that's not anything that hasn't been done before; but this is decidedly an anti-country song.
Did she have to dress like that I'm sure country singers normally dress like that .
Ive been paralyzed from the neck down for 13 years from a dirt bike accident and i just wanted to thank you for giving me the strength to stand again to turn this trash ass shit off
It’s ok but the same old stuff song 🎵 good but just not country and that outfit looks like a gangster outfit. Just my opinion.
What the hell crap did I just hear?
Why Is number one this song sounds nothing Country it's not even tht good.
Beyoncé was on Epsteins list never forget
Ich bin NUR nett aus einem grund Weil Ich kein a-loch sein kann/darf
This is fr just a music video of someone touching their self about 500 times…
Nice hand gestures you doing there 🐐
Aber nun hast du meine volle Aufmerksamkeit 😊😊😊
I can’t unhear “Hey it’s Franklin” 😅
THIS IS STUPID AF THEY AIN'T LETTING HER IN COUNTRY SHE WISHES THOA SONG SUCKS
I've been hearing the rumors that this song sounded just like the Franklin the Turtle kids TV show theme and I listened to it today.  HOLY CRAP!!!  The similarities are scary close
The video must have been super hard to do!  😂😂😂
I just Can’t get this kick and song off my mind lol.
Yikes…. Country does not need this crap!
Worst song I've heard in a minute 😂😂 she must really be low on funds
If she wants to be country she needs to wear some clothes. Female country singers have class, something that Beyonce know nothing about.
Tacky. Insult to country legends. Insulting to country music.
She just doesn't sound country at all at fucking all she may be the queen but stay out of country
good song, shame she has to always get ghetto porn
I thought she would do something different and make it hers. Like Breyland. This is boring. Old has been 😆
Well that sucked. First time Last time.
She shouldn’t make a vid just to show her🍒no offence to the fans but I don’t really like how she just played the same vid over and over again and it’s too revealing like gurl- kids who like your music and saw this would turn dirty mind FOREVER like…… DUDE!
First time listening to beyonce new song love it ❤
Ripping off Franklin like that.
Country music legend, Mr. Alan Jackson, said this waaaay back in 1994:  SHES GONE COUNTRY
This video is stupid she could have went some many directions and this is it
Singing naked?
She's not country neither is this song.
Omg nooo… I hate it😫 Might just be because I hate country music idk but I was not feeling this at all.. yuck
Indecent exposure!  This is like watching soft pornography.  How can videos like this be on this site without some kind of parental guidance warnings????
CuLtUrAl ApPrOpRiAtIoN
Eu to viciado nessa música, Bey sempre surpreende.
Awful
Yeaaaaaa, still a demon looking to take souls.
Betonce trying but failing...langage bad, no wonder county stations wont play this crap
She straight up stole the melody from Franklin the Turtle theme song.  Franklin should sue her ass.
This ain’t country 💀💀💀💀
This is as country as old Town road...
Well country girls don't dress that way. Has to show her books or whatever. Lol. Sucky song
This video is horrible.
Don't get me wrong I like the song, but honestly it doesn't sound country... Again, just so people don't start yelling at me I like the song her voice just doesn't sound country.  I don't think this is going to bring a lot of new fans to country music I think it's just going to bring fans that like Beyonce to listen to her version of country, which does not sound country, but again I like the song.
I love the song and the videos by the fans the best!
Great song, but the Video is awful.  She could have done some dancing.  We all know her body parts, they are the same on every woman.  So tired of entertainers thinking  they have the only woman parts.  Sorry but a natural woman looks so much better
She tries to distract from her lack of talent by showing as much skin possible.
YAS GISELLE!!!
Beyoncé is by far the most overrated performer(she’s not an artist. She doesn’t write any of her songs or come up with any of the ideas) of the last 25 years
Give me Lainey Wilson any day…….
She sings country so well!! Love this song!!
:(
Let's just say she needs to keep to what she does best and it isn't country. Leave that to the white people who do it best!!
Are we supposed to be entertained by this redundant video?
SUPER SUPER SUPER 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩ME ENCANTA
This is not country music, sorry
This song is almost as good as the video! Trash, is this a joke?
Idk anyone in country or Texas that dresses like that 😮😂
What?😮😅😅😅
She's just jealous of Tracy Chapman's attention and class.  She ain't country
L
This song is Franklin the Turtle's theme song. Google it.
I think people don't like it because it's not nasel like most female.
Love the hotness and sex appeal.
This ain't country stop calling it that!
Beyoncé Country 😂 OR NOT!  Pretending is not always enjoyable. I’m from the south. Country and R&B my whole life. The only thing I can see is her doing the boot scoot and boogie.  Or theres a tear in my beer 🍻  No country singer here.
The last part of the song was hot! Should've song the whole song like that.
First song ever I don’t like and I loveee all Beyoncé’s music 🙈
Plsssss more country music like this 😩😩😩
Who would’ve known she would be a country singer? It’s pretty impressive.
This sucks..she got mad bc she didnt win grammy now she tryna takeover   another genre so sad
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
I’m personally insulted 😤
No no no
There's a cooldown in a city 🏙️ 1 right f******Lexus for your key 🗝️ up yeah girl go there ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Making more money for sure 🤣🤣🤣😊😊😊
I’m not a fan Beyoncé has always been a r&b artist and I feel that’s what she is good at don’t fix something this isn’t broke just my opinion
what a boring video
Why does she have to be naked....
Satanic garbage… plus she stole the beat from Franklin the Turtle.
It sounds like the Franklin cartoon theme song 😊
Why is she topless😊
🐝 🐝 🐝
I want a real music to watch but this is pretty good im liking it not to bad i guess
Wtf.. smh... As long as you're half-naked that's all that matters it's all about the views..
She's putting on country face.... This sounds like a computer wrote it
This isn’t country music, it’s pop with a twist. Not sure what a visualizer is either, but I hope she doesn’t try to represent country music like this. We Texas women take more pride in ourselves and don’t go around wearing nothing - we have more respect for ourselves.
Sucks like the rest of her music
I all of a sudden, don't wanna listen to country anymore. Absolute trash stealing our culture
Couldn't finish the song. No thank you
Thats how you know franklin was a good show it inspired so many
Hmm 🧐 I’m not a fan of country, but I don’t knock other genres, however If I was going to mock or make fun of country music this would be the song.
Just because she sings country words does not this mean it’s country don’t ever say this is country
in tiktok is crazy
Never have liked Beyonce music.  Not a current country fan.  But I like this song and her voice.  The video isn't country.
The Franklin theme song same sound and instrument that's why Beyonce is not legend Copying to old song hahaha I know because Renaissance means Rebirth so she rebirth a song hahaha no Originality duh!
I think I liked the backup singers better ! Just not sure of the country sound for her .
Yea ha😅😅😅 yes Beyonce
Anyone else missing times when female singers didn't have to perform naked? Apart from that, great song.
It’s catchy….
She loves that finger gun apparently
This woman don't have the body of a woman that has ever gave birth ...
I honestly don’t really like her music and this song is no different.
nice ti ts
Beyoncé  Texas Hold ‘em   She’s fantastic
Being from Texas, love country music and love our Texas Girl Beyonce, this song hits it out of the park.  Not have to learn how to do a line dance to this song!!
Pop music trussed up in a "country" facade does not make it country music. This is garbage made for morons.
Worst video ever. Really no class or even a shred of attempt. My 8 year old could do better.
garbage not real artists.. copy n paste
I guess they saved a lot of money making that video🤔
Hmmmm   race appropriation???
It's Franklin with lots of "COOL" cuss words. 🎉😂
This sucks!  The backup singers sound like they’re sneezing and it sounds like the Franklin theme song
From black panther to yehawww 😂
Nice Milkers, Terrible song.
🤦 I live in Texas, trust me, the people who listen to country here do not like anybody not white, just sayin
Love, love, love it!!!
This is NOT country... country music is Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, George Jones, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, etc.
Sounds like Halsey’s “You Should Be Sad”
So repitcious...
Demonic as hell. Serpent glasses and baphomet hand gesture
Lmao country I don’t think so I’m sry for country lmao she stole the turtle theme song lmao thief
Cultural appropriation. Funny how its ok for some people...and done poorly at that.
I really wanted to like this but it sucks. I love hick hop and have liked most of Beyonce music since she was in Destiny's Child, but this sounds like crap. If anyone else had made it, they wouldn't have been given the time.
That must be a real Paine in the A§§ for MAGA Republicans in the South🤔😉A Black Woman is No 1 Country Song🤓
😂 🤣😅😂😅😂 WTF is this???
What Country music?? Hardly music at all. Put some clothes on  look foolish, say u r a queen, industry hv u brainwashed for the 💰!
How do you block a song? I don’t ever wanna hear this 💩again lol
I love Beyoncé music, she's awesome. The song is great, not vibbin' with the video though.
It’s catchy but honestly the lyrics don’t make sense lol but ya can’t help dancing to it!
I love country music and she just took it to another level ❤❤❤
🤣
Seriously geta life
You get one, two tops finger guns before it’s weird. 😬 wiCHU sounds like a sneeze. I wanted to love this.
Yum 🤤
I don't understand what she's wearing. I get the provocative part but I think… How is that country. Just because she's pretending to shoot a gun?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂this crap B..notTtttt 😂😂😂😂I can't laughing
I don't listen to any of the current music today, but I'm here because I saw a news article that said Beyonce's new song is similar to the opening/introduction theme song for the cartoon show Franklin (1997). I grew up with that show as a kid. That was back when Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Gundam Wing, Power Rangers, and Toonami were booming on tv.
Song is excellent
Video stank
Una diosa con una de las mejores voces!
It's country not good country
This is the absolute worst so called country song I've ver heard in my life. The lyrics make absolute so sense. WOW
The only reason she wanted to do country is cause she's growing old and irrelevant just fucking retire already no one cares
This is probably the gayest song I’ve heard
Country Era
All I hear is patronizing.
Since when does country music make you want to walk around in a vest with your titties nearly popping out? No taste at all.
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared  Does anyone else think Franklin The Turtle might be upset with her ripping off his theme song? 😂
I dOnT lIkE cOuNtRy BuT tHiS hItS dIfFeReNt"  this isn't county. Hell half the music on country radio isn't country and this isn't even being played there.
She will never make it in country music dressing like that
this song sucks.
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
This ain't country. Clowns 😂
whyte people saying “Beyoncé singing country music is a government Psyop” lol they so pressed because the only and first two country songs she dropped are better than their entire generation of country music ☕️😂❤
Hey Franklin....
Should not be singing country!!! Don't sound good at all
Congratulations to Beyoncé on Texas Hold ‘em debuting at No 1 at the America billboard top 100 for 2 consecutive weeks (and counting) and debuting at No 1 In Amazon sales, Apple Music, Spotify, iTunes sales, Canadian and UK billboard charts and in several countries.   Topping the Country billboards chart as well as the first black woman ever. You will continue to reign supreme, the greatest ever! 👑🫅🏽🐝🐝🐝
Garbage lyrics from a garbage singer. Can't even write her own songs.
Reminds me of Dick Clark- catchy and I like the beat.
What a song !🫣💕🔥
This is a bunch of f****** b*******
Not country
People actually buy this shit
I'm not usually a fan of country music but this song is such trash like most of her music🤣🤣 what the hell are people smoking thinking this is good🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wheeler Walker Jr please smash this shit!!!
This is complete GARBAGE 🤣🤣🤣
This ain’t real country you can never convince me it is!!!
Not country music
I didn't have high expectations when I heard Beyonce came out with a country song, and I thought it was gonna be terrible, but I have to admit that it's actually pretty good. Good job Beyonce! 👏 👏👏
Yeah Nar!
Yeah Nar!
Culture appropriation
FLOP
love the song but not the flygurl angle image. But then Casy and the Sunshine band did the black bubblegum thing in the 70s so I guess this is get back? Love to know what Johnny Cash would say to this- he would probably like it, Allen Jackson?,..., not so much! LOL!
Is this the official video??? Very disappointing..but the song is fire.
Sounds like the theme from Franklin the Turtle 😅😅😅
Sorry , just cause you add some traditional country instruments & give them a twang , it doesn’t automatically make a song “COUNTRY”,,, may have a few similarities, but,,,”It’s NOT Country!!”
Rubbish
i love this song
Video doesn't match the song
Not even country
😂😂😂
Utter drivel
I Actually like it
It’s serving major turtle. Bêyonçě is a very talented entertainer, but Franklin is spinning in his shell right now. If pickin and a grinnin don’t deserve a better video I shure as heck don’t know 🤠
Hearing the rhythm without the lyrics, i wanna watch Franklin now, "hey its Franklin coming to play."
Wtf is this supposed to be?  Cant believe the white man holding this black woman down and forcing her to sing country music
A guess they threw cultural appropriation out the window 💯💯
This is the opposite of good. What makes this country? Sounds like pop.
Hey it's Franklin coming over to play...
Horrible. Stay in your lane.
I have to tell you I was never a fan Beyoncé, but her voice so suits this music. If her entire album is like this she has a new fan and me and I’m gonna follow her and I’m gonna buy it. I have to say I did love Dreamgirls
Such a mediocre melody..if it ain't Queen B singing it it would be a flop.
Gonna fuck country up now good job
As talented she is and this the best she could do for a video ???? Smh
I am a Saudi woman my whole life and I have never visited America, but I heard this song that has nothing to do with the history of Texas, whether in the manner or style of Ozzy’s singing. Even the singing voice was not good. If she had appeared dressed as a ‏Texas woman, it would have entered my heart.
Very nicely done.  Growing up in Houston we know you knew the venue.   Glad you are trying other types of music.
No. Thank you. Stick to your other genre.
Garbage 🤢.
This isn't country music this is just pure garbage
Clipe mais sem graça.  Faltou criatividade.
Why does she insist on wearing very little, ruins her and the song.
Too many white  country gatekeepers commenting on here.  The song is number 1 globally,  suck it up and stop moaning and stop being racist. The people all moaning would be praising the song if it was being sung by a white blue eyed blond.
This ain't Texas And this ain't country ...stay in your lane   BTW.  definitely a Franklin the Turtle rip off

All you clowns thinking this is country music 😂
Not a country song. This sucks.
Wonder how many NDAs were signed for this.
Country just like my pawpaw liked.
I like Beyonce….. Catchy Beat but Dumb AF!!!
It sad how many depressing white people commenting” this isn’t country “ like you just feel the hatred cause if Taylor made this it wouldn’t be an issue at all. It’s almost as if they trying gate keep country music as if they was the originator’s in the first place.
To all of you saying you are not country music fans but you like this. Well that's because it's not country. It is a catchy song though.
Do Pop para o country. Como ela faz isso? Incrível!!😍
You guys only like this song cuz it's the Franklin theme song and we all grew up with Franklin and he was awesome. He was little Bear's Best
Frankin the turtles theme song is really popular......lmfao
This shit fucking sucks--- Leave Texas out of your shit ass songs--
Wtf is this? Disgusting
Stole the theme music to Franklin the turtle . Straight plagiarism, can’t even write your own music , had 3 Canadians write it , and the theme from Franklin the turtle was Canadian too , no coincidence there .  At least Taylor swift writes all her own music and lyrics ,
This is not country, wtf!? This made number 1!! Absolutely unbelievable
Ah so cultural appropriation is alright when it's white people being appropriated 😂
Awful video
La country est d'abord une musique black 💪🏾🌹🇨🇲
Just because you mention Texas in a video doesn't make it country...
This is so stupid
👌👏👏🔥
This isnt country music. She ran outtta ideas for music
Universe meaning: "uni" means one and "verse" is song. We are but one-song ... life a tune 💚💛❤️
Is it me or is the video just on loop? I thought I was experiencing technical issues with YouTube. 😅
This isnt country 😂😂 but makes me want my cousins more
RUSSIA IS NO.1 AT TEACHING SALSA 💃 AND BACHATA: NO PUERTO RICANS OR DOMINICANS WERE HURT AT THE WRITING OF THIS COMMENT!! 😂🤣
For me this song is a joke...
WTF is this? Did she listen to one blue grass and decide she could do country? I'd take this song a lot more seriously if Nelly was featured. It's a good song but this is not country.
What the fk was that?  That's not country music.
okay what in the actual fuck is this garbage?!?! like are we listening to the same thing? this is like a bad country ai bot generated song that she was like I bet everybody will eat this shit up!and now look at ya all!😂 this songs absolutely trash asf! and I bet yall will have her at the grand Ole Opry playing this shit before the end of 2024
Did Kanye dress her? Looks just like what he’s got his wife and him wearing?!
A return of Sasha Fierce????
Love Beyonce...but this AIN'T country!
This must be a joke 😳🙈😅🤮
This....this is what the hype is about??? Ummm, not to be rude but, not as good as I thought it was gonna be... she sounds forced. Good but definitely not worth the hype. Come on Reba, Le Ann Rimes, Faith Hill, Dolly, Loretta Lynn, Shania Twain.. all better than this just saying
What a boring video. Everyone thinking all they need to do is show flesh these days to be a success. It’s getting really old 😏
She’s just trying to get those swifty fans… even though swift barley even does country herself. She’s tired of competing with her so she’s like can’t beat em, join em… but this song is truly lame. Please go back to what you’re good at. This is worse than Justin Timberlake Man in the Woods flop. Both of them should go to Timbaland and get him to produce some bangers for 2024 and make an early 2000’s comeback, because this ain’t it.
Hard pass
Sad day in the country music world!
Not special at all. The Beyonce brand means that people are curious to watch.  Showing her body helps the number of views, too.
This is Horrible
This sucks! it's NOT country and it never will be!!! Keep trying to out do Taylor! That's why you trying this! She's trying to win people over by being half naked.I pray it don't win people over!
I LOVE COUNTRY ALL MY LIFE THE BLACK & BROWNS TOLD GOOD STORIES...THIS QUEEN FROM TEXAS COUNTRY MUSIC IN HER SOUL MY FAM FROM THE SOUTH N COUNTRY IN MY SOUL AS WELL THEY STOLE THIS MUSIC FROM THE BLACK & BROWNS + THEY MADDD WHAT WE INVENTED THEY DONT WANT US TO SING GTFOH WE MADE COUNTRY MUSIC THEY SHOULD BE ASKING US TO PLAY OUR MUSIC...READ BOOKS GET THE KNOWLEDGE PEOPLE WTFU.
I don't like it. Looks Cheap
Love this tune.
Kanye bitched about her not winning a Grammy, jay z just bitched about his wife not winning a Grammy not to long ago.. now she finally gets the point rap/pop we’ll get you a small fan base but if you go into real genres you’ll expand your fan base worldwide
Hey there Franklin....... 😂😂😂😂ripped the best kids show intro song
Got damn!!!! Shit! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
What is this 😂😂😂 Useless and senseless😂😂
well, Welcome to the flo now!
Country Beyonce might just be a whole new level 😮‍💨
Not real country. This is a mockery of real country music.
Love this song but the laziest video ever.
Beyonce's books are fake. More power to em
The fact you say "bitch take it to the floor now" and you're a mother is actually gross @beyonce
This shit is so ass 😭
Does this count as cultural appropriation? 😆😆💀
Has absolutely nothing to do with country at least ride a horse.
Hey franklin.
This is fkn terrible.  There's a tornado in my city. Get to the basement. It ain't pretty.  🤦🏻‍♂️🤣 Bet it took 4 writers for this.
One more.satanic song from satanic Beyonce
Nice Illuminati costume and 1 eye tribute to her Masters 🤑
Texas Holdem. Dimi Put 'em down face up I got 2 jokers Love to stay but hate to get the job slowed up
People that weren't fans of country music all of a sudden liking country is BECAUSE THIS IS NOT COUNTRY. NO WONRER YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN "LIKE COUNTRY" BECAUSE ITS NOT COUNTRY. wtf is going on
queen
I see comments that it isn't country, but new country doesn't sound anything like country music of the last 70 years.  It is   morphing into a new genre, like it or not.
Now we get all these Non country people liking  country.. where were you with an amazing country artist like Darius Rucker?? NOW you like country? Wtf
Big tune. Ryan would appreciate this and he kinda does. He is actually dead beyonce. I have a slight part of him and I can sort of mimic him but I'm not as spiritual or as clever or as nice. Sorry your baby boy is gone. I will miss my husband forever and ever. I can still pretend if your prefer. The truth is this he blew his brains out for my love and to be with me in heaven. Now he is with aaliyah.  I'm quite sour. I will try to stick to this plain as long as I can but I don't mind a heaven reunion to be honest
This song  Definitely isn't country. Use country song words and some background electronic made sounds and call it country? Hate me all you want. Not being rude. Beyonce is one of the best females to ever touch a mic. In my humble opinion. This isn't it. This isn't country. To me.. it's just not. Wish her the best but not for me. I'll continue to love her in every other genre as I always have but this is not it..not for Me. Doesn't make me a hater either. Just said she's the queen of r&b and everything else. Not country.
pure shit not even close to country
No
WtAf this is ain't country 😢
This song is great, I enjoyed it. Had me dancing around my house😅
mid
This isn't country 🤣🤣
Can she not afford clothes?
this is the biggest bunch of trash my ears have ever bled to. Country, lay off the crack pipe!!
Sad following cheaps of a modern clown
Song great, video sucks.
What's the point of the video?
Somebody call Franklin and tell him he’s got a lawsuit
Give it up, we don't need u in country music
She couldn't stand there being an award show she couldn't bully with her fame sad af
Imagine Beyoncé remixing with Morgan Wallen orr Luke Combs
Worst video clip ever
uhh...country stations were called racist if they didn't play it, so yeah it was the most added.   The real question is, will they report it as much when it dies quickly because it is an awful song that does not belong on country radio and that actual country fans don't want to hear?
Yee Haw! 🤠 What a sweet surprise!!! LOVE this!
Lol wow absolutely awful if you really have a singing voice then country should come especially easy and idc about Beyonce fans this is trash absolutely
Is it really necessary to hang her boobs out
Video lacked any creativity
It’s literally Franklin the turtles theme song sped up this shits ass
Poor video and song.
This shits ass
I like country and I like some of Beyoncé’s music but this was so bad couldn’t finish the song 😵‍💫
It's a great song ... got respect for artist who can try new things. I am moderate to consertive guy no idea what dukes of hazard guys talking about. This songs cool. I can see this being a big dance song at a country bar. He's out of touch.
This isn't country, don't pretend it is
Dolly Parton on the remix?
Honestly this doesn’t sound like a country song.
Not much of a video  Couple of boobs and eyepatch
This ain't country that's why you like it's pop crap just like the rest of so called country music all pop crap
good visuals
I’m a country fan nie!
Trash
This is not my concept of a country song in anyway.
A song with Texas cards and whistling doesn't make it a country song. She looks like she is headed to her pole to see if she can get a few dem dollar bill$
This has elements of country, though it may be faint, song sucks too.
Never shows her singing ?
Who else is here to see @Beyonce doing the ritual with the fingers?.
This song sucks… how is it number one?
I wish you would release your songs later in the year so it’s still super popular when the awards are given out
What A POS. About as country as AC/DC.
💙👸🏼💎🌌🦚🦋🌻
Hey it's Franklin
This is the Franklin the turtle theme song…… on original
😂😂😂😂😂
This sucks
It's far far from Country. Nice try but not good.
What in the hell is she wearing put some clothes on you have children that look up to you and here you are walking around half naked wtf
This ain't true country... Just some schlock to get hip hop fans into country music? Or vice versa... I dunno, but it's dumb. No self respecting Southerner would drive a Lexus! Lol
This is a great pop song, but it's not country. Somemore west coast line dancing would have helped the song as far as visuals go.
She's alright, but this is just a terrible song... Wtf?? So poorly written. There is nothing here. Repetitive, Lame. Where has all music gone?
This is the worst song I've ever heard. Lol. Wtf.. why didn't j stop this. 😂😂😂
This is a wonderful country song . One of the best ever! Beyoncé is a country Superstar!
I would say this is more Americana more than anything else!
It sounds as if she’s sneezing when she says “with you.”
The argument of if this is country or not is ridiculous - all music evolves and apparently sports.  Look at what Taylor Swift did with football.  She brought her fans to  football, and football fans started listening to her music.  Queen B is doing the same for Country music.  She is introducing her audience to a new genre and hopefully people who typically listen to Country are willing to listen and appreciate  her artistry as well as listen to other music in her portfolio.  I guarantee in a year other women in the country genere will be "borrowing" her style and will be totally acceptable.
Loving the song!! ❤ But NOT loving the seizure the video caused 😢 REALLY wish that there had been a warning at the start.*This is just an explanation so hopefully the trolls will have a little bit of empathy for those of us who are photosensitive: I'm not always super photosensitive but depending on how I'm feeling, tired, etc can make the seizure threshold lower. But regardless, I still really love this song!! It's nice to see/hear artists expanding their own horizons and giving their audiences a chance to experience the amazing talent and versatility they have in their toolbox. 🎉
She could get by with sangin the telephone book names..she is great
😍😍😍😍
If you are inclined to country, great - but for me, it’s still country, and me no like!
HahahaH😂😂😂😂😂 r you kidding me. Worst song ever
GRETCHEN WILSON ANYONE? God I can’t what into they’ve paid the media enough to NOT PLAY THIS AGAIN.
BOOOOO GET THAT TRASH OUT OF HERE
You aint slick Beyonce:  https://youtu.be/vWNwhdDNoqI?si=3_ZTBTzW_1AdDqM-
Try again
I've always been a country fan this one is awesome to ❤
You are almost naked. You can sing better than that.
What a weird song.  Don't like it
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why do I have to watch a cyborg trace her breasts and shoot sparks out her fingers over and over. Meh
Like the song. Stupid video. Slutty as usual.
And the choreography? 🙈 Doesnt matter, the song is great! 👸🏻❤️
Nah! Its it about the song or nakeness?
Love how to song is about Texas and the music vid has nothing to do with Texas  NO HATE
Boring video lol
Country is a blend of rock and folk. Pop Country is country with a pop twist. This is pop trying to be country and failing to be so.
Is it just me or does this song sound just like the “hey it’s Franklin” theme song?!?
What a joke😢
Tacky in every way
Put some clothes on
Honestly it's just nice to think Beyonce might dig old country and western and blue grass music
Songs ok, dumb video!
⚡️🔯✡️🔯✡️🔯✡️♈️♉️🔯✡️🔯🔯✡️🔯✡️⚡️
Extremely sexy I love it
doesn’t sound country but i do like it
Beyoncé has more trust in that vest jacket, than i have in my life  Edit:I think I started a war in the reply section
Not country. Dumb boring video. That's me being nice.
I am NOT a fan of this genre of music. This a Beyonce just don't mix well.
Not country...lol
Is she Becky with the good hair now?
This isn't country so don't call it country
Had no idea who sang this song. Was listening on my Echo show/TV. Saw the picture on the screen of a mostly naked woman with blonde hair. Now it makes sense that it was Beyonce. Tonight I was excited to see the video thinking I'd see some amazing line dancing choreography... what the literal F?? Worst video ever. I mean I watched the entire thing waiting for something other than her repeating the same thing.  It was a cute into ... but the whole video?? Lame AF. Tiktokers have 1Mx better videos to this song.
Sex sales 😔
higher
She stole from Franklin the turtle!!!! Sneaky, but we Canadians know! Hope they sue her 🤣😂
Facebook brought me here
You Need more clothes on to be country
😂😂😂😂😂😂 she went from white people bad to straight white woman
I feel like Beyonce should be able to do country music shes from texas,but put some clothes on and stop with all the foul language,you married with kids,and everything doesnt need all that and i think that thats one of the biggest problems the country world has with her
pass.
I love Beyoncé so much and so does my friend
Don't like her outfit....or song
That's Not Country
Please don't ever again this was awful. Country people don't go park their Lexus also after your superbowl performance you really have no business trying to try being in country music stay in your lane.
Hell no, keep your fan base out of the country genre, it’s already in a shitty state.
Beyoncé can't do no wrong
Nope not feeling it not country 🙇🏻‍♀️
Love it. She's beautiful!
Why ruin it with the gun stuff? Aren't we all against that?
Country music has officially went to 💩
Hey, it's Franklin😂 how unoriginal
Might be no 1 because if all the Beyoncé fans. Wont win any CMA awards either However I’m sure JayZ will let us know when Taylor Swift wins album of the year again
Had check this out becauae people all over are making a big thing of it.   So confused by the video. What the...???   The song isn't awful but, the video.   I can't.
yeee hawww!!!!!
Who called this country music
PUT SOME DAMN CLOTHES ON
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY THIS IS POP
Not a fan of Beyonce.
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!!!! COUNTRY MUSIC IS GEORGE STRAIT, GARTH BROOKS, HANK WILLIAMS JR, AND KEITH WHITLEY!!!! You are a ASSHAT if you think this country!
Black people invented country, rock and many more genres 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
So a stripper video ! Linda Martell was the first black female country singer ! This is a horrible country representation
Ok that was lowkey soft porn.
I heard This song from TikTok
Yikes..... she should just stick to her genre. This is awful.😂 talk about cash grab
Nope ...  love her ......        just nope .  Video sucks
Copied Franklin the turtle
Congrats on trying but it's nothing special.
Kind of funny that the only difference between her and most other country artists is that she also makes pop music
What’s with black woman trying to be white first the blonde wigs then trying to lighten skin and now they tryna steal country music .. this is TRASH for country music please someone stop this rubbish
It’s giving the Franklin theme song. Goes to show you can do anything with a large fan base! I prefer her older music, her new stuff isn’t good at all. She fell off after the lemonade album in my opinion
She's saying it's not Texas and having sex.
Where is the pole dancing and twerking?  Yeah, Patsie Cline would be real proud of this video as would Hugh Hefner.
This ain't Texas, it's a hold em.
people who say not a country fan but i like this, you like it because this is NOT a country song. and the video is horrible.
Beginning of the end of country music
That’s stupid stomp clap hey trend is back. Yay.
Not good at all.
The music is great the video makes it sluty.  Country music is cleaner than this dirty video
She's a Texas girl
Nice mamms
I don't get the video, it's a sexxy display of Beyonce's chest and the eye patches remind me of the character Madonna did some years ago. Songs ok, not obsessive like "Old town road", just average.
No 👎👎👎👎👎
Why does it just do that move over and over again btw love this song❤❤❤
Not country
This IS NOT  country. She doesn't even sound country. Dressed like somene you would never take home to momma. This country saddens me more every day. We have lost our idenity and assemblance of a normal people. The divide has widened. Eventually all will be a gray, muddy color as socialists like.
Congratulations on your #1 country smash hit 🖤
For those of you saying this is a country song, it definitely isn't  its juat another pop song and its  🗑️... I cant believe Jay let her record this trash
People said Beyonce made a country song so i came here. Still haven't heard a country song from Beyonce....
99 blomems hit
What happened to her clothes? Did she lose them in a stampede?
Hey it’s Franklin the turtle. Lol
Franklin the Turtle theme song, totally...
I hate country music but I gotta thumbs up this song because it pisses off white supremacists.
Dolly did Rick n Roll… Beyoncé does country…   well. What in Earth is next?  Eminem puts out an “Adult Contemporary” album?!
YESSSS SLAYYY
This is so bad. I'm not sure what she is thinking. And this video?? Just no.
Beyoncé I am your biggest fan ever and I love your music especially drunk in love
Unreal.
😂😂

If you have to be have necked to get people to listen to you, ant worth it!!! Bull S__ on it SAD !!! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I'm assuming the video is to accentuate the boob job?
This song sucks 😂
nice Beyonce
This isn’t country. Whatever it is it sucks.
All the Canadians not realizing we’ve heard this tune before.  All I’ll say, is Franklin the Turtle for life.
Good song but please put some clothes on

Just because she makes one country song is not mean she’s country
Can she do it live without an enormous entourage
Pop not country lol
HaHa she ripped off franklin the turtle intro song 😂
IT WILL BE THE FIRST A I GENERATED SONG TO TOP THE CHARTS😮
I definitely think the song is better than the video, and i am gay so that says a lot!
❤ Beyonce singing “Texas Hold’em – I haven’t heard any other version
Yes Yes Yes Beyoncé took it country Oyes this ain’t Texas now take it to the floor, round and round you go lay your cards down park your Lexus,take it to the floor Oyes Beyoncé took it there country at it most finest with Beyoncé wow I must say Beyoncé put the round and round you go in this song 🎵 Texas yes go round and round you go Beyoncé one step to the right Beyoncé got it ,get it Beyoncé clap it, rounded it Beyoncé with  a dosido swing your partner 💯💯💯🍰🍰
WTH???  Um stay in your lane, R&B!!  Oh, when you can't win R&B song of the year..... this is what ya do!
i like the song but do not understand the video at all. super fun dance song and nothing happening here.
Nothing original as its a rip off of the franklin the turtle theme song from the TV show, i bet she will be sued as its almost note for note the  same song.
Bwahahaha.  Please B.....  And I do mean B.
The song is ok buts what's with the outfit.
😂💩
This sounds like a plastic country music
D.E.I. COUNTRY MUSIC IS A PILE OF 💩
You may rest in peace, Tina Turner. We got a great performer continuing your legacy!
Why all the pushback? This has something for everyone! Uniter!!
Pop not country...
But way is she just walking and shooting her hand like it's a gun
Thats duncken awsome , shut the mother melons front door😂❤❤❤❤❤❤  NICEEEEE  And her being black what kinda shit is that, dont matter is her talent!!!
Country Music is down to earth real life Music. Sorry not something like showing off your chest with a song and your fingers shooting made absolutley no sense. She and Destinys Child need to get back together!!!! Sorry
Trash!!!! WTF she know about sum tornado or dive bar!!
I needed to hear this and I’m not one to comment but this is NOT MY COUNTRY MUSIC this is pop and she NEEDS TO PUT MORE DAMN CLOTHES ON
I don’t care for the outfit in this video but I like the song though
This is not no country music this is some shit like dog poop shit
Such a disgrace to the Country Music Era.
This aint country music
This isn’t country at all lol….. it’s a pop song with some country background her vocals are not even country lol…
Fuc##$ up video to me a laugh for a county video and song!!!!!!!!
Beyoncé is here to sluttify and whorify country music. Disgusting. I wish they would not let her get away with her filth.  Jmo
I don't hear anything that's any different than the rest of the worn out crap people are calling "country"
Not country, at her age if she has to be half naked to get noticed. Pretty sad!
Lmaoooo that’s her music video???? #lame
The genre of country western for me symbolized the values of America... family love and deep positive values and I’m not from the US but this image and some of the words are a real insult to everything Western  Respect the culture don’t superimpose the values of pop culture and perspective that is as old as America itself
I like the song. And just so you know there are other things that are sung about in country music. Big jerks you others are!! Beyoncé you are awesome ma’am!❤❤
The current stat is that 25% of cowboys in the old west were black.  I'll bet it was more.  Hat tip to all my black brother and sister rednecks.
BLACKUEEN Kuotes🖤 Thanx👸🏾B 4RemindingTheWorldOfTheOriginOfCountry&BluegrassMuzak💎 #OurBLACKisPhenomenal🔥
The video is lame but I can't believe I kinda like this song....
I'm telling my grandchildren this is Blanco Brown.
Mon dieu quelle horreur et quelle vulgarité 😳 je suis choqué ! 😳
The video just does not marry with the lyrics.    There is a noticeable spicy flavor with a mustang kick yet, her lack of movement and energy makes this an average music video.    She undoubtedly was gifted with an amazing voice and yes, acting can definitely be added to her portfolio if she decides to explore another career field.   Unfortunately, there wasn’t much brainstorming prior to releasing the video.
If you think this is country...we need to talk.
Stupid trashy no class video and song. Come on, really?? She needs to cover up and go back to what she knows, geez
Ewww
I’m loving this season
I like the song but the video really sucks!!!
Hooboy.  People with cars on blocks in their yards are BIG MAD about this, hm?
Bullshit this is not country music and never will be trash ass music
Stupid  ,makes no sense
Trash
Look up the theme song for the cartoon Franklin. There is absolutely nothing original about this song other than the lyrics.
What is happening
Lovely song!! But why she is almost naked, so unnecessary!!! Beautiful voice is enough!!! What’s happening to this world!!
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared.  She didn’t come up no damn country song she stole it from a cartoon. And all she did was change the lyrics
Toby Keith was only dead like two weeks and y'all started calling this country
Pretty much socks, put some clothes on!
Absolutely garbage. A white Person can’t have braids or make “black” music and if you do it’s racial appropriation. Guess it doesn’t go both ways. Sick of these double standards.  Either way this is no were close to country music😂
She changed the lyrics to the Franklin theme song.
Absolutely piss👎
This is awful!!!!
So hooked on this song from Queen B XO
Lmbao, the real question is, is *"Beyoncé"* attempting to sell Country Music? Or is is *"Beyoncé"* attempting to sell *"Sexuality?"*  💯💯💯💯💯💯
Absolutely NOT. This is not it. My grandpa loved country music and you could feel their music this isn't genuine at all you don't feel anything. Just r&b pop vocals over a country beat = it's time to hang it up Beyonce.
Corny 😂
FRANKLIN CALLED. HE WANTS HIS THEME SONG BACK
I LOVE THAT BEYONCÉ IS ON THIS TRAIN OF RECLAIMING COUNTRY MUSIC AS A BLACK FOLK MUSIC GENRE.TEACH EM GOOD HOW COUNTRY YOU CAN BE QUEEN B
Don't like the song. Don't like the outfit. Not country to me😢
Stupid video.. And an even worse song.
Trash 🗑️
Pssh I think Sza: Nobody gets me is more country than this..😢..why all the hype go see for yourself.. reply here::
SHES GONE COUNTRY BACK TO HER ROOTS SHES GONE COUNTRY LOOK AT THEM BOOTS
OMG, AWESOME!! Telling the truth about the real roots of Country. I Just LOVE THIS!!❤❤❤❤
She needs to stay in her in own lane.
Just cause she’s half naked & cussin’ doesn’t make it a country song!!! That’s rite, “ It ain’t country!!!”
What   Amazing  et  explosive  new song by beyonce.  Over 22  years  career As solo artist  and before  with destiny's group. She still the best et shining artist  and i love again  again
I came here just to hate. I already thought Beyoncé was overrated as fuck, yall ate this banjo ass hickory dickery shit right up. I’m even more disappointed as a society. Stop it.
Well I think I'd rather eat the barrel of a double barrel loaded shotgun, than to hear that shit the call pop-country music
I think I would have really appreciated the song if there was proper country music attire. I think what was on screen was in poor taste. I understand wanting to be modern and sexy, yet i would have liked to see a little authentic get up. Sorry Bey, yet this wasn't for me.
Love❤
Nope
el ojo , el que quiera ver que vea
Isn’t this the Franklin the turtle theme song?
Yes, now that a pop star suddenly goes country, all of a sudden the genre “isn’t that bad”
I know I will get flack over this but oh well. Mrs B you don’t need to put profanity in your songs it just makes them bad to listen to. Stay in your neck of the woods or clean up your mouth. But good luck if you stay
I don't know what this is supposed to be but it sure ain't country... and one of the worst attempts I have ever heard...I mean it's really bad. She needs to stick to the ghetto where she is Queen
Garbage
This isn't country hahaha
This is horrible it not country
Next time dont bother wearing any clothes at all! Lol
It sounds more pop gospel than country.
This SHIT ain't country.......PURE GARBAGE!!!!!!!
🚮
I dont understand why this is country just sounds like a hip hop song with banjo added
The only way she can beat Taylor hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha after watching awards and she does this hahahaha
Songs ok but wtf is up with the video
I dont like itt
what a lame=o
Lol wtf?
This is not country this is horrible.
Go away bad dream
THUMBS DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWNNNNNN

Wtf is this
How low she sinking.... 🤮
This sucks. This is not country in any way Sahel or form
I've been trying to avoid this, but damn yt shorts...I don't do the  tick tock or other social media so I guess I just need to lean into it. Good song Bey, you didn't need some comment to acknowledge that tho. We both the same way. I don't need a compliment because we both know we are awesome without it 🤌🤌🤌
I'll have to say I'm disappointed. I'm not a big square or anything but the outfit ain't going to fly with a lot of country western people. she should have toned it down and probably not done the leather thing. I guess when you're in Hollywood and a star for so long you forget how far too go. not a fan
It doesn't sound like country it's sound like bluegrass pop .😂😂
What the hell is she wearing?  Has to cover the one eye.  Ooohhh no
For those don’t know she is hoping for the downfall of Texas because there not supporting this woke ideology, and is she an only fans person😑😑😑 like why.
What a disgrace to country music…. This is absolutely terrible. And a joke 😂
Damn it I like it
Well damn, very pleasantly surprised. Love it!
"Everybody is like oh I've never liked country, but this one is good. " Lmao, because it's not country! She's just relabling her music to break easy records with her massive established fan base. It's rigged!
i dont get why people have to sex up their music videos, dont they think people will listen or watch if they dont. your talent is your voice, that should be enough in my opinion.
So, porn sells country music?
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for its 2nd week on the chart! This is Beyonce's 13th overall #1(9th as a soloist)! 👑🐝
She stole the Franklin the turtle theme song and make it suck   What kind of crap music is this
And here I thought before listening to this I could not hate her anymore.
Horrible ! And she has to be half naked because this song is crap. She has a beautiful voice for genre but country is not it !
Not country.
This song. Takes me back
👎
Bluegrass inspired pop about a lexus and partying but the melody is better than some bro country about the same things. The video is lacking. She could've told a soulful love story or painted a beautiful memory like genuine country.
Like the song just needs more clothes on
Wow I have second hand embarrassment for how ridiculous this looks doing the same thing over and over. But JayZ has her brain dead like mice going back to the side of the cage getting another hit of “this is your brain even MORE further from reality”. Hollywood has become one big dump fest of disappointment disaster and how to act when you have lost all morals, sanity, way in life and where you have to keep a plug on standby in order to keep a woman sorry enough to stand by your hot mess self. I said what I said. Him and Diddy need to take a long walk on a short pier.
Country porn
She’s not a country singer
Why bring half naked to country?
Dont like it but get what shes puttin out
The song and video are very😂🎉😅 sexy but it doesn't sound like country music😂 I'm from texas born and raised, 😂🎉
This is NOT country music! This is awful!
I guess I look at it this way Eminem jumped in the hip hop house and turned it into a mansion. White boys are good at rapping we are really really good at rapping so let's let the black chick do her thing in the country. All this talking about David Allan Coe we know we know all about that dude he really don't like black people he let you know that in his music as well. Who really gives a s*** the world's already going downhill as it is anyways just let people do their thing live your life and be happy as you can
Definition of stay in your lane!
Terrible
I love the sound, but she swears too much. And her being naked is just gross.
Vycuv
White men came to America with their ballroom dance music. Africans came to America with country music, hip hop music, blues music, rap music, rock and roll music, and R & B music. And guess what? The whitemen steals them all and claims them to be their own. They have no shame.  Go Beyonce, reclaim Country Music, which is rightfully yours to claim and inherit. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Put some clothes on
I don't dislike the song, not head over heels either. I do think it's a good first try. Except for the video. The Pete and repete was a bit much.
Country girls use real guns…and wear clothes. Not exactly the country I’m used to nor the old stuff. But good for you girl, go get ‘em Texas Hold’em!
Songs kicks ass. This video is as boring as it gets. She better get a damn Grammy for this.
The lyrics make me cry. She is such a good singer but what the fuck
The song is 3'557'' and the video 250''... that's mean...
I love this song but this is the most boring music video I've ever seen!
Stupidest song ever … disgraceful and disrespectful to the whole country music genre!!
❤
It's not country tho..... I'm not sure what it is to be honest
What bullshit is this?   Lmao
embarrassing... yikes...
Es Franklin La Tortuga... Woow
Bey foi luz nessa ❤
I'm a huge country fan, this song is amazing!
This just doesn’t hit the mark for me as a country song, it is good and her voice is amazing. It just misses the mark with me. Yes I am old. Tex Ritter , Kenny Rogers and George Straights old.
😂😂😂 absolutely garbage
Vai cantar essa no Brasil?
Country sounds doesn't make it country! Just like having a black national anthem doesn't make a black nation in America!
I came here to make fun of the softcore p0rn level of the clip, but this is actually good 😛 well done
Stupid I best never hear this on a country station
This sucks. It sounds like the themes song music from Franklin the turtle
This ain’t country music
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 this is not country. The only reason she won was because of her skin color. This is junk. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
This MIGHT grow on me....buts it's a no for now. Not feeling it at all🙄
This ain't a country song. This is just disrespectful to us Texans.
Great all aboard the hype train. No thanks for country give me Brad Paisley any day of the week.
Now this is truly honky talk music,she is so talented you go girl you did this song 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰
Never seen a country singer in pantyhose and without bra singing, a new low has reached.
Hey ... its Franklin   https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=rIQVec4y1fzmZ-p9
Why does she dress like a stripper, and she should have stuck to the music she is really great at.
Does Beyonce know that she doesn't need to produce a whole song as an excuse to show the world her tits?  Just start an Only Fans like a normal narcissist.  And stop misappropriating my people by wearing blonde hair.  It's offensive.
For everyone saying “I’ve never been a country fan til this” news flash.. you still aren’t.. this isn’t country.
#Tom MacDonald for number one
We need more country from Beyoncé!!!
Generic
Isn't she like 60? Put some damn clothes on.
🤣🤣🤣 this not country, this is garbage.
Cuz it’s BEYONCÉ DUH! lol very catchy 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻 now go listen to MORGAN WALLEN & CODY JINKS!
I like the dance that people have made up to go with it. She just looks silly
Nope.
This is not country.
This ain’t no country music 😂
Wonderful Beyonce..i love it!!!energy is great❤
This is not country at all!!! This is just another POP song.The video makes no sense. She is only riding on her name. The song is terrible!!!
Seeing as how this is now number 1 in both the US and UK, I had to see/hear what made it number 1. Why? How? Is this country music? Forget skin color, seeing as how that was brought to the attention of many when a few radio stations initially refused to play this song, this isn't country. I'm not going to make someone a ham and cheese sandwich and try to pass it off as a slice of pizza. And that is basically what is happening here. And yet, those who agree are scared to say anything because they will get labeled as racist/prejudice. And those in the genre, who are coming to Beyonce's side of the table and saying how much they love this, are either scared to have a target on their back or going where the money goes. You know, don't bite the hand that feeds. I hate that so many people have not only lowered their standards when it comes to music in general, regardless of genre, but are so afraid to say anything at all that differs in opinion from the collective mindset. All of it is depressing.
She definitely taped em up.😅
This is not country music 🤣🤣
Anitta🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Great artist, bad person. G3nocide supporter 🙃 Beyonce is a sellout. Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
🇺🇸💩💩💩flopada
What a joke stick to your nasty music🤮🤮🤮
Where the poker ?
It’s catchy, wouldn’t say it’s country, but I listen to old school country so that is probably why I wouldn’t consider it.  I hope it does well for her.
Just awful.
🎉😢I’m the only person who doesn’t like this song 🎶. It should be slower or a different musical composition, & leave out the curse words!!! But it’s good to see African Americans taking back country from the evil redneck mask 🎭 they put on it to steal it from us!
She proved that music is universal
Why does she always have to be naked? Issues
Coutry
Amei ..diferente   e esse banjo.adoro Music cawtry...ela é linda .❤
THAT IS NOT COUNTRY ITS JUST SMUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Trashy looking
although i don't care for the song..i gotta respect Beyonces willingness to completely step outside of her comfort zone and record this. hopefully she'll continue to put out a few more!
Its just not a good song....
And the crowd goes mild!!
😅nice attempt but no..
Sorry but not feeling it
This isn't country
Ohh nooo..   Her voice is NOT meant for country, and this is NOT country...haha😅
She really lost me with her nearly naked walk toward the camera.  Nothing about her says country.
Better title Sellotape hold 'em
This video really sucks and was very disappointing. Thank God people on Tik-Tok are making this song more enjoyable when I watch them dance to it.
All of a Beyoncé fan after watching the video
Beyonce is washed up and shes trying to make herself relevant with this lmao
Hot dang! This is EVERYTHING: past, present, future all at once! 👏👍🏆
I now understand why country stations do not want to play this. Disappointed!
That's it? That stupid walk up, tits and finger fireworks? OMG hahahahaha. What a fucking joke.
I just knew this was gonna be stupid, but i actually liked it. She should put some clothes on tho, her voice does justice by itself.
If I recorded myself doing a poo, added a country instrumental to it and titled it "poo'n aint holdn me down" does that make it country song or me a country singer?
A Lil big town collab on this 🔥would  be.
Am not sure why anyone considers this county? Just because the words are Texas Hold ‘‘em doesn’t mean it’s country I mean I like it but it’s not what I would consider country music
She's so far from a country star let me tell you get some more clothing on and I doubt you're shooting bullets out of your fingers
Stick to RNB soul
Oh Beyoncé… you can do soooo much better… what a disappointment tho… the song sucks, her boobs are the only great thing and that’s sad…
I forget she is Black. Why do People always point it out? Charlie Pride was a Great Country singer in the 70s who SOUNDED COUNTRY
I wish she would close the cattle gate down there while she’s pretending to be country.
I wish she didnt have to dress that way. Have more respect for Country Music! I think shes not been doing well in her own Genre lately, so shes  trying Country
This is not country 😂
She has always showed more skin than talent.
The song is great the video is horrible!
🎉 I am ready to swing my partner, round and round🎉
Is this country?
This song is pitiful...just my opinion, but I don't see what's so great about it. It's definitely not country music either.
Even cowboys need sleep.
What a dumb hooky song and she looks so trashy.
Glue some metal on your face and do country.. what's she going to rip off after You & I?
This song sucks ass. It is not real country and it doesn't even tell a story it just a bunch of nonsense
This demonic 🐄 cow!!! An y'all just praising her!!! Shows how many 👿 are actually out there!!!! SMDH!!
Not really what a visualiser video should be….
Actually a good song
Heck!! a Cow Poke Song and Tune at top of the Charts. Nah! Not country music and Not Black too. A bit of Flesh ONLY. HAHAHA
H-Town for life Go B❤
Dumbest Country song ever heard !
Honestly, I’m not a fan of Beyoncé in any sense of the word, never have been. (Of course she sings well, I’ve just never gotten into her music.) But her voice is very soothing in this style of song. I’m surprised that I like it.
This is not country.  And the video is awful.
This is not country at all
YO SHE RIPPED THIS DIRECTLY FROM FRANKLIN THEME SONG
And they say country sucks
Stupid🙄
LOVE the song. Video? What was the point of repeating the same move 30 times. Should have been cut with bar/ poker room scenes and two-step. Would have been more interesting. But it's an incredible song and shows Beyonce's versatility and talent as a performer.
This isn't country
Coat tail … ya old … losing it!!! Foul 🫶
I have No words ,  other than Good luck B. In the country music
She learned all the key words for country and made it just like all the others.
I'm from the south heck I'm from Nashville.  I've watched amazing black women struggle to make it in country music and becuase of her name and because she wants to be country...everyones jumping on board??  Having blonde hair and a cowboy hat on doesn't make you country it just shows the stereotyping that is going on.
Nope she needs to stay in her own lane. This is a disgrace to country music!!! Said what I said
This just proves that country music isn’t just for rednecks.
DAMN
It might have been better if the Video was more about the song instead of her being About Naked. The song is actually not bad.
Сериал,действительно классный,приятно смотреть,актеры красавчики,все сезоны классные, очень хотелось бы продолжения!!!спасибо за приятные воспоминания,после просмотра !!!!
Meh
He'll no
She's done it again . They betta let her in 🤠
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC IT IS POP !!
Is she #1? in the US? I heard ithe song once and knew it. Now it‘s time for us in Europe. Congrats to this virtuell going timepraking genre you hit ❤️💐💫🙌💫
Devastated she didn’t keep the banjo going, it was awesome. \
This sucks. Bee just stay in your lane!!
Disgrace!! PERIOD
Will someone stand up at the CMA's and say, Beyonce should have won?
Garbage.
She needs to put some clothes on.
That's not her..I don't like it..
Negative... This isn't country music... This is a knock off. Her voice is not suitable for country music. Also this video is a disgrace to the song.
Well this suxs 👎
She is top tier. As a life long country fan I’m so excited for Beyoncé to grab the charts here.
This sounds more country than dolly’s album sounds rock.word of advice though is don’t sink country when you’re not country! Also don’t dress like a lady of the night! Not that I had much dk begin with but I have less respect for her after seeing this! Also anyone who thinks this is poison any way.
She sings a basic line dance style country song not even writes it and now she suddenly taking back country for the black population. Country originated from grassroots style but became more its own thing. Gatekeepers much yall.
The song is pretty catchy, and the view is pretty awesome :)
Not good. Rubbish video.
This is not country  !!
And last time I checked country singers don’t need to strip and make men and or women look at their private parts for a good music video 😂
Still covering that one eye. You so lost! 😂
This ain’t real country lol, this is terrible lol. This is pop country if anything 😂
This isn't a country song
first of all shes naked thats a no go disrespectful af and not womenly at all sexulizeing the music industry still.. 3:00 min in and its repetitive with zero skill in country grahmer it just goes to show popular people make shitty music and get paid for it but when i make shitty music i get told: idc about the opinions of mfers because *black people invented country music* just admit this is trash
I’m not a big fan of Beyoncé.  But I really like this song.  Way to crossover!
Like this though not a big country music fan.  Looking and sounding great as always!  All the best to you and yours, Beyonce!
Love the song but no sense in cussing and put some clothes on. The video is very cringy.
T-RASH!!!
Well, you know what they say "sex sells".
Don't sound like country
As country as taylor swift
Let’s talk about this being AI? Ridiculous
At first I wasn’t sure about this. However, after the third time hearing I can’t get it out of my head!! ❤
Wow Bey what a great video 🙄
I wonder where the real Beyonce at?!! 🫥 Ole Sasha Fierce has stole the show and gone country with the one eye covered…
Well Carrie and Miranda just as well pack up and go home.
I guess you can take the tramp out of R&B but not out of music.  Explain the outfit.
Since when does Beyoncé sing country???? Sounds like she trying to keep up with TAYLOR SWIFT 😅😅
Wtf is up with those boobs I mean can they be any more fake lmao 😅
This is not country
This video is stale. Like the song but video….not do much.
Just try anything see what sticks …. She is old news
I cant share this video with my grandson. 😢   2nd one this week.
Great country song. Terrible video !!!!
Hey! This is the theme song for the 1990s Canadian cartoon Franklin the Turtle.
Vamos fazer uma vaquinha e mandar um PIX pra Beyonce produzir um clipe de qualidade!
Garbage.
There’s no part of that that sounds country to me! And I wish she would keep her smut on the other side of the aisle, and leave country music alone before it gets raunchy as her music.
Number one #1
Overrated
😂😂😂
This isn't very good as a country song.   The real problem is that the words don't make sense.  If it isn't Texas and there ain't no Holdem, why would that mean you need to lay your cards down?  You don't have cards because it isn't Texas and there ain't no Holdem.  "This isn't soccer, and there aint no goalie, so kick that soccer ball into the goal." "This isn't baking, and there ain't no oven, so decorate the pie." "This isn't Sparta, and there ain't no Spartans, so fight a war against a power that vastly outnumbers you."  Silly.
I like the song ok. It isn’t bad. But it’s not one of my favorites. It doesn’t showcase her talent like some of her other songs do.
What a stupid video.
Leave the country music to the professionals
B you did  your  thing on this one🔥🔥🔥🔥 queen so hears your 💐
Maybe if Beyonce had deeper lyrics, perhaps she would win album of the year...sometime.
no thank you
She about to sexualize the fuck outta country. Rip 💀
Here for those low notes
Rhiannon giddens makes it .. she’s the real deal❤
Makes me want to throw on my country hat 🤠 and dance!! And yes I live in Texas ❤❤❤ Love you Beyonce!!
This shi shitty afff
Congratulations Beyonce I'm wearing my cowboy hat today from the Islam Bazaar ask for China or Miss White at the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia
LOVE this is my new fave song listen to it most of my life right now xx
Am I the only one who thinks this song is not that great
It's honestly not that great..
Hate the clothes or lack of them 😮
It’s awful !!! She just dirtied country music !
AMAZING SONG
This is garbage ugh.  And put some clothes on.
This is monkey music, not country!!
Why did she name this song Texas hold em if her first line says "this ain't Texas" kinda silly.
Lol what a joke she ain't country she's what's wrong with country
Arthur Morgan gonna scream LENNY!!! To this
Love the song, the video doesn't do it justice.
I bet next album is gonna be Rock and Roll.  I'm already feeling impatient.
A lot of walking show her boobs  over and over distasteful to me. The song might have been cute but the video needs to go. Just saying
Horrible
Nothing country about this stupid fucking song what a shame who the fuck told her this was good and called this country bc it’s not  🤢🤢🤢🤢 disgusting
This is shitty 😂😂😂😂 what a waste of my fucking time THIS IS NOT COUNTRY THIS IS BULLSHIT !
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dont care for it
Don't like the vid, the black history of cowboys is forgotten,and this should reflect it, great song, bad choice of visual  repeats
Wanted to like this but it’s terrible. Take her name off it and no one likes this garbage….
It's a sped up sample/interpolation of Kenny Rogers' The Gambler. That said, it's a pretty decent song.
Wow didn't put any effort into the video shows she is not true.   She is only here to disrupt and TRY to bring Satan into country music.  (IMHO)
Thanks Beyonce for making country music trashy.  This song sucks harder than you do.
This is terrible. Worse than anything ive heard. She isnt country. Shes a fake and this sucks.
👎😟
Sorry not sorry, she does not sound country... only the music...
Sounds like someone told AI to create a Beyonce country song. Beyond bad.
This isn't country music!!! This is garbage!!!!!!!!!!
Love the song hate the video
I would like to see some western, Texas, dancin' to make this perfect.
Beyonce hit Texas Gold! Love it.
Country isn't for her
Lord this is absolutely terrible !!!! Nothing country about this mess. She needs to find something different to try and do!
I like the song. Not a fan of the video. Same thing over and over. I was expecting the dance that everyone is doing with it.
When will Beyoncé and Taylor disappear!! And yes country and r and b and rock are black music at the foundation..but Beyoncé is tired!!and annoying
So good B... and ya beautiful
Changed the lyrics to Jesus it would actually sound like a Pentecostal gossip song.
It’s alright. I wish there wasn’t so much bad language in every song these days. Hard to listen with kids. And the video is
Garbage. 🙄
I don’t listen to Beyoncé but this song actually sounds good
Number 1 Yayyyyyyyyy😚
Everybody hitting the dance floor for the line dance with this song.
Fuck no
She's pulling the uno reverse card of Taylor swift
I just cannot like it and I like some of her music. This one not one thing about it.
This isn't no country music,  gtfoh. Disrespectful towards the legends of country.
This ain't country.....
Not country music😅 if I ever turn on country radio and hear this I'm going to lose my shit lol
Nothing country about this 😂
My my ok 👍
if you look for trouble you came to the right place , number one on billboard chart  texas hold`em 1  😀
This is the lamest video ever!
Alright Allright alright  this is just good good stuff.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ loved the sing till I saw skank  ward robe
One minute and ten seconds of my life waisted...pathetic.
Well ? To all the country gals that sang before this . I guess you didn't need a pair of panties to sell a song . WTH
Boring as hell  from the video to the music ..stick to R&B girl  lol you had more action  dancing when you was young I'm afraid you'll break your hip from dancing from being old . Yeah stick to shooting your  imaginary gun  you cant hurt your self that way ...from destiny's child to nursing home child
Unbelievable,  here comes all the pink cowboy hats 😂
The song is fun but the video doesn't seem to vibe with it. Her voice is so cool.
lmao she's calling a short looping video a "visualizer"
Beyonce will be doing county fairs. her career about over.
Love this video.  Gotta love all the hate.  As if Dolly Parton were always so “classy” lmao.
"I'm reading kid slang for dummies, cause they put pop in my country, I want more for my money..." Tim McGraw
I can’t wait to see the dance 💃🏾 she can nail it simple, girl know how to move uuuhh
Heyyy it’s Franklin…. oh wait wrong song.
Why does this song sound like the theme song for Franklin the turtle 😂
I like the song but the video sucks
This is pop country music.  Former record reviewer and writer for 4 publications in usa and Canada.
How are people saying this does NOT sound country? I hate country music, this definitely sounds country, and its 🔥❤
Why is she dressed like this 😢
Shit music
No
This song is trash!!!!
Sick
Yea... Don't quit your day job honey
I'm actually impressed. Blatantly and outwardly country but she kept it fresh and an original sounding country song but with that Beyonce swagger. It's not a cover song as far as I know so she and who ever she co-writes with really put in the work. Really cool Beyonce!!!!
Um manifesto feminino estético e crítico a divisão nos Estados Unidos da América.
This aint it
But the Beyonce Growl is not there 😢
I wonder who she stole this song from and refuse to pay royalties to. Sorry but I don't think her voice suits this style. Not impressed.
I am not sure what the fuss is on this song. I think it is pretty awful! A string of stereotypes about country folk that really don't even make much sense together. And a loop of her playing with her (admittedly pretty) tatas and shooting an imaginary gun. In my opinion another stereotype against us country people. There is no meat and bones or flesh to the lyrics. Her voice as usual is interesting and I don't take issue with that. I just sort of feel like she threw something out there in an attempt to get relevant again, and apparently it worked for the sheeple.
Trashy
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That's time I'll never get back
😮
A tremendous talent put to unfortunate use. Drek lyric.
This shit is garbage
This sux. Stay in your lane, B.
The country gals just got served. Who runs this 💩 .. Beyonce kicking down the door of country music and reclaiming another FBA creation ✊🏽
Sorry don't like the  trashiness. She can do better.
What in tar nation! This is horrible.
not country music  and put some clothes on
This sucks balls what are you kidding me I guess the rap shits done and overweight, and I gotta get into the country in a bad enough you idiots tried steal music from hard rock musicians
Trash.. Especially everyone on this thread that claims all music is black music. It seems black people in America are the most racist group we have.
She's hotter than a three dollar bill.
I thought her main audience was High School Girls?!!!
Are you fucking kidding me? Hate it!! This is not country. 😂😂😂😂
That soong is not country!   Awful
Song doesn't do it for me. Sry.
Don't understand why so many people are in an uproar because of this song, when it's many other black country songs out here. Plenty of black country songs that the black bikers be partying to lol I know because my older sister's bike club only listens to black country music and that started way over five years ago. So why is a problem now. I don't think those black country songs are meant to compare to the mainstream country music, they have their own lane and they're fine with that. I think she knows who her audience is
NOT COUNTRY!!!!
Country my arse
Why she got to be naked.. I know this ain't Texas.. But dawn..  She got children, girls too n husband.. heard she Christian.. Like B "U made it, u can put your clothes back on now.. No need to still be stripping in your 40s, yes u look good & yes song is great as usual but now you need to get U some class"
This song sucks, you can do better
Terrible
This is absolutely horrible

Just no
More country pop but not country.   What real country music has cuss words...I am stumped.
Yeah . . . No. Sure do miss Aaliyah
Your out of your fucking mind to think this is good ..stick to shaking your ass
I’m not a country music fan at all. No for me. I can appreciate artist of all kind trying something new.
People don't realize how many songs she took inspiration from and put in this song. For the first minute, I could think of like 10 songs she put in this song
Too bad she can’t sell it with her beautiful voice and face. Why does she always have to add the trashy skanky to all of it ? Cmon Beyoncé put some class into it .
Everyone always comparing this to “daddy lessons” as if that’s the only country felt song she done.
I like the song but I wish you would have switched up the video
That was trash
Kenny Rodgers - The Gambler. This is literally not an original. Not saying it's not unique, because it is good, but it's not original.
What a tune! ❤🎶🎵🎶
That ending does it for me every single time
i like this visualizer XD
Where is the music video
She is a way better country singer than the usual ones! Love it ❤
What's the point of the same clip over n over   can't you think of a video to your crappy song
Am I missing something ?Is this for real?Horrible video she must really love herself because this video is trash!
To say that this song has no elements of country in it is just a damn lie whether you like her or not. Also, the country music some disgruntled people are comparing this to hasn't been made since the 70s and 80s. Very rare to find any modern country music in 2024 that has no pop elements. We're living in a modern society here and even country music adapts to that.
Why is she nearly naked?
Congratulations woman ❤❤❤❤❤ love the song.. hater going to hate no matter what you do in life.hello..Love you Beyonce ❤❤❤😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰💗💗💞
I think she's a freakin Sellout, she Bribed whoever put her at the top of the Country charts. The song sucks
I don't think country it's more of a hip hop song the banjos doesn't make something country it's your soul you put your soul into that song good job on the song but for anyone out there thinking that's country 0 percent wrong
Yes, you are beautiful and hot, etc., but with that being said, you never cease to amaze me with your musical ability. There is more in depth with this song than just another Beyoncé hit and I hope that people will do a little bit of research, especially those of us that are white as to why you did this song in the manner in which you did, including the music which I found brilliant after learning more about it. I have also noticed through many of the YouTube videos and people doing the Beyoncé country dance, lol That this song seems to be bringing many people together instead of not. Thank you for your brilliance in your musical abilities and I do look forward to seeing what more in the country genre that you can produce. May God bless you and your family. 😁
Yes reclaim our history show them it belongs to us.
0 she's good I like it
This isn't country music, and it's an insult to country music to put this trash on country music radio.
Is this one seen in a loop? Her fans did all the work lol
Liked the song until I saw this video .once again all about her and it's ruined.
They said it sounds similar to Franklin’s theme song lol  I can’t unhear it now lol
But could she do it with her clothes on?
Is she selling her song or boobs…….boobs may bring a better price, songs sounds like a dolly repeat………..
A bore of a vid 💤💤💤💤💤😴
What the fuck is this noise stay in your own lane
This ain’t Country Music. If you want Country listen to Hank Williams. If you want to listen to and watch shit then this is for your taste.
Song good but put some CLOTHES ON- you got kids
Our country stations will not play it they said it is not country
Is this the video for that? Is so its kinda weird but don't sound too bad
Queen b ❤
😁
this isn't country in away
This shit fucking sucks.
Trash
Klan meeting in the comments😂😂😂
❤
Shit house video.
It's monotone and boring. It's one repetitive melody line with some corny lyrics. 😂😂😂😂
Lol. People impressed with this shite. Already has a fanbase, so of course this will be shoved up the top somewhere. More dribble we have to put up with.  Better throw some words or references in there that are country 😅🥴. Insult to real country musicians.
Had to check this out after hearing about it so much. Doubt it would of been such a hit if wasn’t for her name. Just sounds quite lifeless, passionless and boring. This does not sound like country to me but 🤷‍♂️ in one ear out the other, forgettable.
Taylor Who???????
Great song but the video dose it no justice
I hear people saying that she brings country back to black people, sorry to disappoint but country came from Irish
Irish and Scottish ancestors would be proud🙌
the song is great but a shame to be so naked
get dressed 😂
Sorry it’s more pop than country but to each its own .. I’m not impressed . B can literally just sing anything . But it’s the same hook over and over and nothing lyrically that great .. throw a banjo on and some clapping call it country sorry it’s not.. pop country at best
Why does she always have to be nude?
Música que dá vontade de dançar ❤, mas letra e clipe ruim🙄
Somebody come get their granny... this trash
Terrible. Stick to what ur good at B
Meh......🤷
why is she half naked ???
There's   country   music,  and  then   there's   Beyonce,    Its    kinda  like   Gasonline and     milk
Queen. period
❤ I don’t care what anybody says I like it ❤ Beyoncé the ultimate artist
This is as country as Keith Urban. She does it better by 2 points though.
Tom Macdonalds song way better but The Machine bn crushing it!
Not a fan of the outfit choice. I understand, that as a woman she can wear what she wants, but since Beyonce is a legend within her own right, she doesn't need to dress like . . . This . . . To release music. She could be fully clothed and still gain the same traction from her songs.
Are you even a singer without subliminal illuminati bs in a video? 💩
Baphomet
This music sooooks.
It not an black ppl roots, they may have the same instruments, but that wasn't country music either. This historic music is trace its origins to the southern Appalachian Mountains in the late 1920s, particularly in Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. So start over and come again.....look it up. They don't used the word bitch I ther song.
Gurl please!!!  Get out of country!  You have no clue,no back to what you're good at. Keep out of the music you can't comprehend.  Your songs sound like your typical music, TRYING to be country....gurl ain't gonna happen!
Sounds like shit
If you think this is country music you don’t know what country music is
Not a fan of this song
All these comments are bots and fake generated likes . Join a satanic cult and u can all have fake glory and money to buy the same iPhone and a better car to go the same speed limit lol 😂 these industry artist are plants to destroy people the music is ritualistic spells and played backwards are praising Satan but u still listen to this garbage lol 😂
absolutely fuck CMA for not acknowledging this as country. we been through this with lil nas x.
“Ho Hey” sure sounds different than I remembered
I like the song, Love to see Beyonce and Dolly Parton,do a country song together. 😂😂
WTF????
Nah not for me.....
Complete rubbish video
Stay in your lane...this isn't country...video with the same clip on loop....nope !
#1
This is pop. Not country 😂 old town road is more country
When I heard this beat I  thought she was gon start singing     Hays bouncing off my booty....
Muck
the song does very little for me.  and this visualizer even less, lol.
VERY CLASSY, AS EVERYTHING SHE DOES😂
Im not into country music BEYONCE BROUGHT ME HERE TO COUNTRY MUSIC AND IM HERE FOR IT...       STAND UP AND SALUTE
Beyoncé has an incredible voice. I don't understand how anyone could criticise her for singing country style. She does it so flipping well!
She’s not reclaiming anything in the name of black at all🤣🤣🤣 and this still ain’t country… folks need to learn to stick to their own… most of what’s “blk” is just a bunch of shuckin and jiving gum bumpin bullcrap filled with filler bc nothing intelligent is being said at all🤷🏻‍♂️ I said what I said
Nope. I had high hopes but it's a corporate fake. It's  not real country
🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait to see Queen B in Washington DC on August 5!  I'm already so excited!! ❤ u Queen B!!
Stick to R&B
Google Cartoon Franklin the Turtle ! Theme music!
Rip off of Franklin   the Turtles theme! What a joke!
She jacked "Hey its Franklin " from Franklin the Turtle....
She needs cover herself up, why not put a bra on & a shirt. Anything to make $ I guess…
It would have been better if it wasn't the same scene over and over of walking up and shooting the gun.
Worst video performance ever - sorry - I don’t need to see half dressed Beyoncé on this song - have some class !
Not even worth commenting on
I've never heard a Beyonce song.  Have no interest in her musical style.  But, this is great.  Well done, Bey.
This is not Country
Her country album sucks!!! People just made it #1 bc it's her.  That's all. Nothing else to see here!!! Except her showing her body bc that might sell...😂😂😂
All she does is sing the same thing a bunch of time and the same thing with the moves
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared sounds like Franklin the turtle theme song lol
Country?? No, it’s a pop song not country at all
I love this song🤩 Queen Beyonce
Love the song hate the video.
Beautiful woman, beautiful voice, love the song. I have always been a fan. Wish the video would have been better
totally not country but still good
She came right in time for the first of this Texas heat
"Ghetto Country."  Really Beyonce - couldn't make a song without using "bitch" and "shit?"  And she wonders why she doesn't get album of the year. Let's work on getting this shit song out of the #1 slot. Also, the video sucks. WTF is even going on?
Like the song but video is offensive & disgusting
I don't understand all the racial comments I just think this is awesome holy cow freaking awesome
Boring
where is the video? This is boring as hell 😂😂😢😢😢. I guess if you show your body then you sell more records. But you do sound better Country. Not a fan anyway. The video is funny and sad at the same time.
This….. sucks
You sound horrible Stick to what you know! 😅
Wow!! This song is incredibly horrible, I’ll never get this time back in my life, thank you Beyoncé.🤮🤦🏻‍♂️
Video producer : hey Beyoncé how many times do you wanna run your finger up your stomach and pretend it’s a fun?  Beyoncé : yes
she sucks
This song is terrible
The instrumentation is very over produced, the video is weird, I know it’s the visualizer, and very little in terms of dynamics, the last 45 seconds were my favorite because it was the least redundant part of the song. Idk, it’s not bad for a first attempt/first single, but definitely could use improvement.
Wtf did I just watch?
La primera canción de country que me gusta 😍
Looking very sexy Queen Bee
Not people just now realizing that Beyoncé is actually country asf and always has been lol she’s literally from Texas
I'm not even a Beyonce fan, but this is a great song. I like a few songs here and there, but I really like this one, I'm not even a huge country fan either, I'm mostly a metal head, but this is a fun song.
One person said she's "reclaiming black music." What a moron.
Yep! 3 decades in the biz and still #1
She needs to stay in her genre, country music it’s just not for her. I like her other stuff like her original sound. Just some people are not meant for country. but there are some country artists that shouldn’t try to be pop stars or R&B artist some people I just met met for the genre they do
The song is good,but the music video wasn't that good,she didn't dance,just walk,back and forth.
Houston loves Houston so ima support, but all IK is she betta have ran Franklin turtle his bag!!! that's his theme song.🤣🤣
😂😅 what a completely stupid and pointless video. Time for her to start knitting.
Better than I thought. Still sounds like packed trashville cuntry crap but that's 90% of the genre today. If I thought for a second she could hold her whisky or ever stepped foot in a dive bar I might be into it. 6/10
Just because you can sing doesn't mean you can do any genre. Some artists need to stick with what their good at. This song sucks.
This has to be the worst video
Normally don’t care for country but I LOVE this song
Trash just like the rest of her “music”. It sells because of her name, not because of the quality of the music. This is horrible.
There’s no doubt she’s revolutionary, gutsy, talented, intelligent, singer, beautiful, writer, charming n awesome. But I didn’t expect her outfit 🫣. Must b a thing. The CK has the JK with unbutton shirt!🤭
Sounded country with black voice. Amazing combination. Sure a Grammy.
Sounds good to me.
Ye ha Tex
This must be the real video. Super boring and repetitive.
Some thing should be left for really country singer
I don’t understand the video.  Is this supposed to be country music?
Beyonce here making me love country music again ! 👏👏👏
Why doesn't she put some cloths on? not crazy about the song.
I don't like leaving bad comments but if anyone thinks this is country then they need to get there ears cleaned out and there eyes checked.   Real country is  Willie Nelson, Charlie Pride, the Judd's, Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline. That is real country this is more pop music trying to be country.   If Beyoncé wants to sing bring back a destinys child reunion
I HAVE NEVER been a country fan, I respect B and like a few of her songs...But this just makes this 54 year old Brit Pop lover get up and dance.  (but not line dance. lol Just GenX dance). Thank you so much, Beyonce. You did it. You broke through and I think you're going to leave an INCREDIBLE legacy for women, particularly black and brown women, all over the planet.  You and those you work with are giving women hope for the future...especially future generations.  I know to many this is just a song, but I see it as much more than that as we sail forward through space.  Point?  This is history making.
She don't even sound country
This genre belongs ta wite folks missy
Good for music and country song it will live again ❤
The Father of Country is Jimmie Rodgers!!   The real queen of country is Loretta Lynn!!
A maior
Not country
This ain't country. First and last time I will listen to this. Just doesn't sound country and she just don't fit in. The category or this song. All she did was throw Texas in there and that doesn't make it country. Just not for me.
Her star's really gonna rise (some more) now.
Song is actually good! But the video could of been better
I love it
You want to talk about black people in country music?  I'm for it.  But it has to be country music.   Try Charlie Pride.  That's country music.  And put on some clothes. If we want to see someone dress like that we will watch  other genres/artist like Jlo.   Dont modernize it.  Leave it be.   Doesnt matter where the artist is from.  Texas or Alaska. Being born in Texas doesnt make you automatically an oli tycoon either.   Is the language necessary?  Can you make a point without being vulger?   Country doesn't traditionally have language like that.    I wont be listening to it.   Having said all that, I do applaud her for branching out.    Her race has no issue either way.    I wish most things would take race out of it.    I really dont think anyone is upset because a black woman artist put out a country song/albulm.  I think they are upset because it is a mixture  of other genres.   Its country or it isnt.  Its rap or it isnt.  The color of the artist doesnt matter.   I wish her well.  I hope she develops her style even further.  I think she would be fabulous in gospel.  Her voice is lovely.
Video was boring.
Very beautiful
“Spin in the middle boy, I can’t read yo mind”. 💃🏾
I love me some Beyonce such a beautiful women.But why she gotta wear an outfit like that.Girl when your as beautiful as you are there is no need for us to see that much of what god created.
What the hell did I just watch?? She's damn near naked, why?  Can she sing, yes. Does that mean she's country, HELL NO!! Many TRUE country legends are rolling in their graves right about now.
Well you all might as well get use to it.  She really got what they’re looking for.👍🏿
This is the absolute disgraced country music, and she needs to stay in her lane
Why is she arrempting to make white music?
The video sucks 😂
This is just like the theme song from Franklin and friends
This is that genre country rap also known as c r a p....
This is such a weird video….also why is her chest like vibrating near her collar bones?
🏳️‍🌈♥️🧡💛💚💙💜                                                                               Queen B Love You Beyonce                                                                   ♥️🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈
This song IS TRASH & SUCKS. Beyoncé better stick to r&b or whatever she does cuz this ain’t it at all.    Anyone hyping this song is literally just DICK RIDING bc it’s “ BeYoNcE “ she’s overrated asf honestly
Love the song. Wish I could view the video without having to do a trial of the service. I get poorer and the rich keep getting richer.
This is a great song. Why is she half naked?
Not COUNTY.  THis IS TRASH.
Why is she trying to be white?
Terrible.
Nice to hear someone on country radio that can actually sing
She is using bleach cream
This is not conservative country music mam
Just shows you who runs Nashville! Communist Libs.
This is not country !!! All this new shitt is not even country anymore it’s pathetic !!! Stay with your shitty music 😅
😂😂😂
Lyrics suck,  totally flat/empty, but the melody is ok. It ain't no country though
I dont like country but i have a problem with her using bad language. Country music doesn’t roll like that.
Sorry, she has a great voice, but it doesn't work well at all on this style of song.
Does not suit her, stay in your lane, you can’t do everything
Corny song
This song is like pocket aces ❤❤❤
Go ahead now❤
Maravilhosaaaaa❤
Holy shit besides being beautiful she can actually fucking sing
Country has ALWAYS been rooted in soul, and I LOVE IT!!!❤️❤️❤️
..... Lmao, only reason this is number 1 is because 1.shes half naked... And 2. Everyone googled it to hear it.
lol only good country song u mad right bros?
Put some clothes on gorl
I'm not a fan of country ... But tiddies
WOW, that's pretty good!
Good song. Could do without the porn-queen-looking video on a loop.🤷
No good like shit
Trash this ain’t no country music
🇧🇷🇧🇷 beyoncé quebrando recordes com Texas Hold 'Em. Tenho muito orgulho de ser fã 🥰.  Beyoncé breaking records with Texas Hold 'Em. I'm very proud to be a fan ❤.
Doubt you'll hear this in any honky tonk.
🤮
Is this the official video? It's not great like, I assume it's not
I hate you! I can’t take my eyes off you.  Over and over again but I keep watching!
Still a blessed young lady
12 song writers, 6 producers and she wonders why she can't win album of the year 😂. This ain't country and you ain't write this song 😅. It's Mid at best.
Ok I don’t mind this but the whole rope thing/lasso is ridiculous do it right if you’re going to do it at all and that is not how us country folk dress bruh ( you’re not welcome by country folk)😢😂😂
Girl put a shirt on at that first part
There ain't nothi g truly country about this my opinion not good at all
I'd love to see Beyonce explore more country music. Maybe even a duet with Dolly or other artists too.
What in tarnation?
Just doesn't hit for me
Always love Queen Bee and this country music of hers except the video. Sorry Queen. Hope the official one not this video. You can do much better, can not wait. love ya.
Damn them thangs. Hell thats all i see or hear🤷🏻‍♂️
That’s a good song y’all mad
this shit ain't country music 🤣🤣
He really tried to do the country
This music is pond scum. Yes I came here just to make that comment . Blasphemy to real country music artists and fans.
Reclaiming black music? Since when was country music black music. Never is the answer. This is cultural appropriation. You can’t have it all ways.
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
This is not country.
What's with the satanic eyewear?
Anyone else think she sounds like Sara Evans??
Cool song, stupid video but typical Beyoncé.
This ain't no where near country music, you see she had to be almost nude to for anyone to actually like it. Disgusting if you ask me, but that's what the world has become.
Colored in country music! 😨😨😨
wack
Worst video ever
With all black cowboys in history, she could have done better with this.
Video boring.   I like the song about 40 percent .  Wouldn’t buy it.
Shit music
I don’t like country music but t	his one is diffrent
So the video is the one scene over and over?
Not country, not even a beyonce fan. Im here for the reverse uno on taylor swift. Lol. It's great!
Ima just say just bc it has the banjo in the background doesn’t make it country. And let’s be honest the WOMAN OF COUNTRY are much classier. Put some fucking clothes on and cover your shit up
Stupid video. But music is ok
A very convenient song
Beyoncé is Houston Tx raised a true COUNTRY southern Belle @ ❤ Keep up the good work 👑🐝
She needs to put clothes on and actually have some dancers
This is horrible 🤦🏻‍♀️🥴
That's not a song.
This has to be the craziest video ever made..Let's not talk about the song. The song sucks..
This is not country. Sorry but it's the truth
Wow!! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard or seen!! Definitely a "Ho" down!😂😂
Songs ok, but the visualisation is not my cup of tea.    If she were my mate, I would say, "Left breast lump check sister."
I’m not a fan of hers but this is way better then swift every planned  to be ❤️
Wow it’s sad that you have dress that way in order to make the song popular.
I feel Beyoncé’s voice perfectly suits this genre! Like we didn’t think we needed beyonce to sing country but now I want more!
Black folks never made country music😅
This song sux. She shouldn't even try
It's more closer to Blue Grass then country.
Brilliant song, lame video
The sun would be amazing if Beyoncé wasn’t singing it.  So she makes a country song because her music is not doing well.  Country music comes from the soul not from the pocketbook
Not the best video...why is she half naked for what reason does that have anything to do with the song...smh
not beyonce introducing me to country lol the things we do for love...
She made the most generic country song in the world lmfao.
She makes any song sound so lovely and its safe to say she is a goddess if music and a huge influencer i love you Beyoncé
Wouldn't  exactly call it country but it reminds me of the old gal of Destany Child . Those were her best years,when she was real. Her clothes  or lack of  doesnt  sell her,her voice does.
Its the same as Franklin!! https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
Video = 0 Music = 6 This was much better than the 16 Carriages song, but not a #1 hit IMO. She only got that because it's Beyonce. Chapel Hart is much better.
Great role model for our young girls. 🫣😬🙄
Yeeeehaw BEYONCE ( BRAVO mama 👏👏👏👏👏💫👍💃🕺💃🏼🕺🏼💃🏿🕺🏿🤠
This song sounds as weird as white boys tryin to rap.
Beyonce put your bra on!
Wjy do you have to show body parts to make something amazing!!!!  Taylor swift team!!!!!  I love Beyonce but really ??!!!
Country music comes from Irish folk music.
Hot damn!!! Good song!!! This is from a Texan ❤❤❤
I like the song the video is awful don’t know why talented  women have to be naked 🙄
'Righ' abou' now ya' bout to witness..Tha' C Walk..keep it gangsta dog..keep it gangsta'..wha'?..not this vid?..wokay, no prob'..jus' stay fuego, esse..
It’s better than I expected. I would recommend that she stick to bubble gum hip pop.
Texas Estados🇺🇸county Stile 👌🏻🕺
This is not country
Hey it’s Franklin
Not country.  This sucks!!!
I want to report this because she think this is country and it’s not
Country was at it's roots a black genre. Few know that. It started with what is now either called rhythm and blues or bluegrass. One day long before Dolly Parton or Patsy Cline someone went up into the Appalachians and heard the music there (which was white hillbilly) then they went to the Louisiana bayou and heard the African Americans there and they immitated the two styles and started the bare roots of what we came to know as country. And knowing this bit of music history I've always wondered why there hasn't been more African Americans in the genre. You go Beyonce for reclaiming a bit back.
Definitely NOT Country
She couldn't have has a better video
Bossa nova come on baby  and sick my head 😀
Sad that Country music has come to this. Where is her self respect with this outfit, or lack of one. Smh
This is NOT country music. Its pop or top 40.
don't like it or the costume..
Since when was softcore porn considered good country? This is crazy
What’s with the music video, not impressed
Why?
Only Canadians might pick up on this but... It sounds like Franklin 🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢 https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
The titty tape is certainly earning its Oscar winning performance here! 😮😮😂😂😂
Stupid video and song 👎👎👎
I was going to listen to this more but you might as well be naked and thats not really holding up the country music norm....... Country Music is classier than this crap
Just a popularity contest, she needs more money.
Video sucks
I made it to the Boogie part .. absolutely horrible
If this is country music why ain't it playin on my local country radio station, hmmmmmmmmm?
So what's so special about this song?
She is thirsty for attention
That's fckn terrible. Ain't country at all either.  Lol. Y'all out here trying to take over and ruin genres. Just because you sing about Texas or poker or dive bars don't make it country.
She is not country and never will be what is country music doing
Perfect when u got to a country party🎉🎉
Hate her vibrato
Definitely that country swing! No debate.
OFFICIAL VISUALIZER is not the music video people. 😂 Wait until they find out Bey still  has not realeased ACT 1 music videos after teasers like this visualizer.😢
e a mamãe que inventou o country e ainda colocou mais um #1 na hot 100
🤠🐄
Love this song
She ant country I am I know this song is not country so is she
Keep this crap off the country music channels.
There's 4 wasted minutes I'll never get back. I don't know what country she's aiming for, but she missed Country Music by a mile and then some.
Nasty
Get over yourself
Just like there can’t be a black little mermaid there can’t be a black female country singer. Support Beyoncé even if you don’t like her!🙏🏽
I don't see the hype for it personally
Africans taking over so called country music
That ain’t country
Dumbest video , she could of at least had Franklin the Turtle make an appearance 😂
And here we go with the half naked to sell her music . Plus stick your hip hop ..
it's too boring
Song is cute and nothing special for a foray into country music ...   this video is awful and boring yawn!!!
Kashus Culpepper is way better
this is terrible
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Wow, I came to listen to the song all the way through. Clips have been all over social media, the whole song is fire. I wish had done a bit more with the video, but the lyrics and music are fire
What exactly is country about this song?? It just sounds like shitty pop music.. MGK didn't do well swapping genres and neither did Beyonce
This is not county music..😂
CONGRATULATIONS BEYONCÉ ON YOUR #1! 27 years into your career and you’re still evolving and making people feel good with that voice! Bey-Haw 🤠💙🤠!!!
Is this a porno show?? 🤮
The song is #1 given she’s not known for country. Huge accomplishment for her. I also love Daddy Lessons.
1st off put some mofo cloths on 2nd this song is stupid ASF done even sound country, I'm not even gonna say what I really wanna say...this isn't it...white white people where your cancel culture at now....let's cancel this bull shit.
Good song,  crap video. Enough said!
White appropriation.
im diggin it🤠
Definetly did not need that „visualizer“ - she sure is a breathtaking woman but the way female artist are dressing these days reminds me of strip clubs and that ain‘t a visualisation I want to become a reality outside of strip clubs.
This is a total joke, I’m all for music but there’s a limit we should all hold to. Morality has been twisted and turned where we are okay with near no clothing on. She has always been a female that felt the feminism movement worked, but she is just as much at fault as the rest. Hopefully she wakes up and puts out some music with a real message to bring back and reunite this nation
Bruh
pretty vulgar if you ask me!!But it sells whaT DO i KNOW>.sINGING ABOUT SHIT AND BITCH!!wE HAVE REACHED A NEW LOW!!uSE TO BE SOME COMMON DECENCY!!wE JUST GO FATHER AND FARTHER DOWN THE DRAIN.tHE SONG ISTSELF NOT BAD/bUT WHY SHE NEEDS TO BE SO VULGAR?
That’s not even lady like to show off cleavage   She needs to retire already.
❤❤
Love ❤
I hope Franklin the Turtle gets his royalties from her stealing his theme song
Is that song form formation album??? No???? Changed the path??? What happened????? Stick to something one please Beyoncé!!!! Or you wanna steal all music? Disgusting…….
When is the real music video coming out?
Real country singers don’t need to show some much skin to be in Bilboard 😅
Sex sells..,.puh leeze......this is not country music.  Hoe Down?
And this is not country music either. Cute song though.
I like the Song , not the video
Not country music
First-time listener, and I have to say, this is very catchy. Good Job Beyonce!
Ok song is catchy,  but the video sucks. Sorry not Sorry.
🩵🩵 I feel like I’m watching Britney Spears’ IG story though
Linda como sempre ❤
😂 disgusting
Go back to your hip hop music ..You are discussing in that outfit . Don't make country music .Also  put so damn clothes the hell you are a disgrace to country music !!!!!!!!!
No class , no morals.
Not country 🤡
Wow, a lot of black victims in the comments 😂 I swear every black person on line acts like we live in the early 1900s
Haven't heard this yet so i had to come see what the fuss was about. After i wish i hadn't and im convinced there are some artists who people will clam did a great song even if its just them farthing in a can. Be loyal by all means but atleast be honest.
as a texan this is 100% reap
Not bad of a song but not a damn fan with the clothes she is wearing. Since the teens like her music and like what she is wearing. Parents start carrying a 12 gauge Shotgun.
if she wants to be country… then at least put some clothes on…
😂😂😒🙄
You mad ppl in the comments can say it’s not country all you want… it’s #1 on the Country billboard….clearly they think it’s country lol
Why does she have to show half her boobs every time to sell a record?
😂
This isn't country 😂😂😂😂
This is terrible. 🙄
She’s too old for this
This is the Theme Sing to "Hey Franklin"
Beyonce 😊
If you're going to play with this, make it explode big orchestra
Good day everyone this rock song o Beyonce nice song at ang selection song beautiful that we have.god bless.
This song sucks lol
Where's Jay Z. Is he having a freak off with any other underage girl 😮
Dumbest song ever! SMH
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I loved
So wrong in so many way. Im am sorry but this is not a country song in any way shape or form. SMDH.
This is terrible 🤣 how is this country?
😂😂😂
Black racists be like... can't we just have one more white thing to ourselves, that we think is ours.
This is the fakest country song ever
BRwaaah, what a joke
Disgusting.
Little simz is way better. You need to step up among these young artists that will beat you.
This is the worst and if you think it's country your nuts
Really.. Where is the class?  This is nothing close to Country Rap.
Aww, she is a Taylor fan! Taylor is leading the way!
The only reason this did well is because she is litterly naked
It's a hard 'No' for me.
I just wanted to see what Beyoncé could do. Not for me. Her pop music is much better. The southern twang is too forced. Not good.
Sounds like a car commercial and looks like a Klingon whorehouse on repeat.
This ain’t it  😂
Garbage .. miss racist trying the white people that she hate so much genre 😂😂😂 the irony
this is horrible...
wow, Beyonce sings country ❤❤❤❤
Ok but please don't dance🙏
This isn't country it's rnb with a country type beat ,and it's not worth a sh@#
this ain’t fresh
She’s tired of Taylor Swift winning lol
😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stupid thats all i can say
Maybe to some this is country. But not to me. She is very talented and the song it self isn't bad.
DIDNT NEED ALL THAT SKIN..Good TUNE SHOULD IF MADE A DANCE TO GO WITH IT
I haven't been a big fan of most country music produced after 1980.  So, while I'm not absolutely loving this, it's a damn sight more original than 99 percent of the arena-pop country that Nashville has been churning out for the longest time and that alone is a big positive
Hell yea
I think this vibe is good !
Sucks! Not country.
Horrible!!
Not impressed. Whens Jay Z's reggae song come out
The number of people in these comments that cannot read and understand the words ‘Official Visualizer’ is truly disturbing. Seriously, it’s not rocket science and shouldn’t be that hard to understand
Chills
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for its 2nd week on the chart! This is Beyonce's 13th overall #1(9th as a soloist)! 👑🐝
Meh
No no no this is not country, I think she should stick to what she is great at, and that's pop.
Number 1 on Global 200!  Well done Bey!
im really hungry righ nowshe looks very beautiful
Why do you have to make about race? Its a great song but just because she released it does not mean shes reclaiming a black music genra. Same with Rock and Roll! You can claim Rap, Soul to some degree, lets not forget the  Righteous Brothers were white and R&B if you want. But as i said its not about race. Its a about a good song, thats it nothing else!
Straight up indecency😢
A lonely carpet roll has formed somewhere!
Let the covers begin...
Ok  NOw Im a believer
Uncle Tom country music???
You go Beyoncé!!!! Wheww that lady never ceases to amaze! Hope she does even more country…her voice is phenomenal! And she is a Texas Gal! Love ya Beyoncé!
Modern country music is total trash throw it out where it belongs the dumpster.
Over 9 million views in two weeks people can say they dnt like this song or video but they keep watching it.
And honestly she looks a lot more white than she was about a year ago. So I don't know what she's doing but this video is so repetitive and the same thing over and over and over and it's really boring. Just my opinion.
Honestly this is not country music because she said she says she does the same thing in every part of the video nothing different she doesn't dance she doesn't look like a country girl all you see are her boobs and her g-string!!! It's not country and it's not cute it's just the same video and picture and stream over and over and honestly the song sucks because when she says go park your lexus.? What country person really has has Alexis and not a 4 x 4 a pickup truck or a motorcycle? So this is just a bunch of b******* and she's trying to make more money off of country music!!
Just sexual content
NUMBER 1 BILLBOARD HOT 100
It’s catchy but no she is out of her lane for this…
These white people mad lol
It's GIVING AS ABOVE ,So BELOW,baph worship
This isn’t even country and shes not the first African American female to top the charts just in the pass 20 years
Illuminati moving over to the country folk.
lazy video and needs to put some clothes on !
I actually like country music but I’m good on this one…it don’t hit fr
She is trying to get Country Music fans and its not because she is a country music star, she is hoping it gets her an album of the year finally. Not impressed. Go back to your genre B.
Did yall beat Franklin the turtle up and steal his theme song. 🤣🤣🤣 Fuck outta here with this hot garbage.
What the f**k is this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
One thing I would like to say, maybe two, Country music is not a white made music! Look it up but I'm happy that today Miss Beyonce is getting recognized, and not only her, but other Black country artist!
Bey resurrecting  the entire music industry one genre at a time.
I just don't like it!
Wear is her f clothes smdh not feeling it at all
I can see why country fans aren't liking this.
Beyonce & Mick Jagger or David Bowie!!!
What in the actual fuck 😂
https://youtu.be/IvNJxuHfLbM?si=nKJ1pVR9I5TvG2Sn
BEYONCÉ - TEXAS HOLD ‘EM - FEBRUARY 26th, 2024  #1 NEW ZEALAND #1 IRELAND #1 UK #1 US #1 CANADA #1 GLOBAL  MWAH, NO BARS 💋
Waiting for the dance challenge.
Boing boing boing
Garbage
Taylor who?
I REALLY wanted to hate this, but I can't. 😂
OMG, I'm not that much of a country music fan, but this is AMAZING! Awesome initiative on Beyonce's behalf. 💖
I'm sorry. I just don't get it. It doesn't work for me.
🚮 This isnt country music!!!!
Black people seem to be on a kick right now of thinking they invented every type of music in the world 😂
"This is Franklin"
I’ll be honest and straightforward. I’m not a fan of Beyoncé at all but this song is catchy and I also like it because I drive a Lexus,and she mentions Lexus in this song lol.
👎👎
Beyoncé said this was the perfect country and western song. I wrote her back and said it was not the perfect and country western song because she didn’t say anything about mama or trains or trucks or prison or getting drunk…
This isn’t country 😭
trash
Number 1 song on Billboard. Suck it up haters! lol
Trash
Yijaaa
garbage song. Please stop doing country music. You don't know what good music is and haven't since Destiny's Child.
I like this why does it butt hurt putinpublicans so bad. Cause it's a black woman making good music
This is not Country Music
She becoming more and more nakedness
Wtf did she have to go and copy the Franklin cartoon theme song?
Appreciate the attempt at country.., but maybe, try again.
Dang, talk about calling it in on all levels. Meh all around.
How did she keep that jacket on?  😅😂😅😂😅
@zt Willis so your saying African American founded country and rock and roll that not true . Congratulations to Beyonce in her successful transition into country she deserves it. But the origins or history African American have with country is the cruel slave owners learned to play the banjo through them that’s all and who in country uses a banjo still today ? Seems sort of racist saying white people didn’t invent any music genres if I’m understanding you correctly I understand African Americans definitely have roots in country and invented hip hop , jazz and blues but how so with rock and roll ?
What a joke
Just wish the video had been a bit more interesting.. But great tune 🎶 😅😊
Don't like it at all !!!!
Pathetic
American nude trash culture with no self respect as usual...
Love the song, hate the visuals. Dress sexy not slutty.
Totally ripped off the remix of Adele's Send My Love: https://youtu.be/9NUXCOpAfYU?si=gXA4kzpGhuHOzvxK
So from award winning video from years..past to this?
I am big fan from Kigali Rwanda 🇷🇼 and l love y❤❤❤❤❤❤
Song is so-so, but the video is lame.
Wack! She is a poser with ghost writers on staff.  #isaidwhatisaid
Doesn't matter anyways but black people didn't create country or rock for people that say they did. Music doesn't belong to any particular group anyways so quit saying that stupid sht like ol boy down in the comments below.  (Come at me crazy ppl)   The history says asians created pizza! If you disagree with me then youre a racist to Asians! This is how you clowns sound! Keep gaslighting though! 😂
never fails!! 😊😊
Ewwww why does she need to try and sell her music with this kind of crap 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Is there anything that Queen Bey cannot do????
Like song. Not sure I get why she stands there like that
Going bac to her roots of growing up in H-Town aka Houston, TX the birthplace of Detiny's Child.
Awesome song, but very little choreography, maybe she didn't want to take away from the song but ashame as beyonce and her choreographer  could have thought of a cool dance sequence❤😊
Why is she naked ?
Number 1 on the Hot 100!  Well done Bey!
The dumbest and trashiest country music videos ever made!
I don't like Country, and I hate Rap. I'm authentic Gen X, but I must say I'm liking this song.   My mother made me listen to Country as a kid...and I'm feeling this song. I'm a huge fan of Jazz and music history; this is good shit.
Nothing about this song or video is country. It’s not a good match for her vocals. She done nothing in the video. Not a hater either I like her and her music I am from Houston also and support her work just not this..
Can she do anything with out taking it to sex. Your an old woman put your clothes on.
So sad you’ve descended to only fans
🤦🏻‍♀️👎
😂 this is God awful for country lol😅. Get back to commiefornia
Why is she half naked and she do everything over and over.not for me thanks this video
Is this a joke?
Yeah great song. It is country no denying. Can’t wait for the album.
❤❤❤
No thanks is it sound like she lost a best and hand to make a country song …
It's not even a good song. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Does Beyonce' ever think about the little girls watching her videos?  Obviously she does not care that once again, she is promoting "being sexy, being an object," to her young fan base.  Put some clothes on and show some respect for all the country greats that have come before you!   This was "strategically released" the same time as the Grammy's.  Tracy Chapman & "Fast Cars" beats this song hands down in terms of quality and importance.  Granted, a fun dance tune and great to boot-scoot to.   That's it.
Please dress the part.. at least.!🧐
Does Beyonce know who the 1981 bull riding champion winner at the Houston Live Stock and Rodeo?
😂😂😂😂 just no!! Girl bye
I discovered this song by a cleaning video I was watching
But remember her husband was a pimp when he began selling drugs and women in NewYork....so showing off his wife's breasts not a big deal...sex sells.
Lmao this ain’t country
She really nailed that old west prostitute look.
O BRASIL TE AMA BEEEEEEEEEEEEEY <3
But let’s discuss that BANJO, shall we? You GO Rhiannon Giddens!
well, that was a £5 video, never been so disappointed in a Beyoncé music video. Great song
This crap Sucks, STOP lying to yourselves and be real. This crap is a R&B song just because you trying to have a southern draw and say stress the last word of every line doesn't make it a country song
Great song, wished she’d bother to wear clothes. She is talented enough without being naked…❤❤
Now the infiltration of the illuminati drones into Country music to pervert like they did to MTV and all the music stations  ..its the MUSIC not the BOOBS and ass . WAKE UP people its a takeover
OMG I LOOOOOOVE THIS!!! & I hate country music 😂
Great song.  Meh video.  I hope a country line dance video comes out next.
Adorooooo
#1 billboard top 100 chart congratulations queen of music 🤠🥹
Idefw Beyoncé but some of yall are fried😂😂😂 This isn’t the MUSIC VIDEO. This is a VISUALIZER.
Yeah she should do Johnny be Goode next.
Not sure what to think. Maybe a line dance song that they would play inbetween some real country music?
Is that beginning not Franklin the Turtle beat?!
What a missed opportunity for a fun video. Instead we get to see a scantily dressed star once again. Talented woman, selling out to the music industry again. I love music. Beyoncé is beautiful but this video is so redundant and creatively shallow in my opinion. This is just an opinion before I get crucified on here.
Lord help us
She ain’t reclaiming a dam thang ain’t nun country bout this leave it to the real country men 🇲🇽 cause everyone know we do it better
republicans hate this, i love it.
C'est dommage les spectateurs vont se concentrer sur les seins... que d' écouter la chanson. Elle a changer performance de la chanson country
I feel a little cheated by the dancing, lack thereof, but the song is catchy. Great Job, Bey
Sounds good.  Could use a plaid shirt and jeans though
She absolutely ripped off the theme song to Franklin the Turtle. A Canadian  children's cartoon
She's selling her ass on this video and the song sucks ......
I rather listen to actual country music, and I don’t even listen to country music
This song is crap.
TRASH!
BILLBOARD HOT 100 - 02.26.24: Beyoncé - Texas Hold 'Em ❤
cant even make a music video just looping the same 8 seconds ?
The song itself sucks, which is why they had to Sex Up Beyonce so much.        Good Try.
Song is good. Video sucks!
O kadar paran var bu mu klibin 😅saçma sapan işler 😅ne kadar sıcak ve samimi video çekebilmiş…
Wow. Country s gone porno. Imagine that 💩
Satanic filth.  One eye all seeing eye. Sold her soul.
She’s got this mad sexy Kano thing going on!!!
*No expense spared on this video* 😅😅
TNA....country.....There's a country.He has prepared for those who love Him... No eye has seen  nor ear has heard those things that He has prepared For them that love   His appearing 🎉
Like always half naked......
It’s the fucking theme from Franklin the turtle
Stay in your wheelhouse
Meh, black women from the past have done it better. Sounds like every other one of her songs. Big black voice, extra vibrato and tremolo
Franklin
Why she looks so white?? Is she trying to pull a Michael Jackson? She is black so why she is trying to whiten her skin?
Lmao. This is garbage. I don’t have a clue why people think this sounds good. Everyone I know that listens to country would turn this song off.
I love Beyonce. I do not like this song. I think she is a great singer. Maybe if it was a different song. I am sick of everything being about race. Beyonce is an American. The race of everyone is human.
How dare she try and expand or experiment with other types of music. What artist in their right mind would ever do such a thing?
Wants to use southern style for the money but bitches about southern and republican states in her free time. What a hypocrite.
I don't like the song but I watched th whole video...🫣
I don't like it
Fuck me that's brutal,  is this what passes as music
To say I’m UNDERWHELMED is an understatement. 🙄
I think the video could have been better
Not sure about the outfit but the musical has some toe tapping energy. 😂
WTF this ain't Country, go back to LA
She didn't write that.
Pure crap!!!! 😂 What is it with this video also ...  half naked ..ugh not necessary really... Just because you add a Bango doesn't make it country ....🤦
What the fuck 😂😂😂
She didn’t write none of this ish. Yall praising real writers and artist for this fraud
Not an authentic country song to me. It’s mixed with rnb genre.
She is overrated, as usual.
Meh.
Hope a dance video will be released
This heffa.. smh
I’m gonna let you finish, but Beyoncé had the worst video of all time!
I'm not a fan of Beyonce or country, but I actually like this.
omg sound so good for a country song
Wating for the official video
Lol complete trash
She want that Grammy she tired of Taylor taking them awards
❤❤❤
I’m not a country fan or a beyoncè fan. But this is good
Nice guitar
That's Country?
This is terrible 😂
Lmaoo girl stay in your lane this isn't for you 😂
My opinion I just wish they would put some clothes on.   😮
This reminds me of Captain and Tennille over any other country I've heard. Has a definite 70s pop vibe going on with her harmonisation. it's great.
So sad to see Beyonce go from classy to ho 😔
Terrible take on country. Typical band wagon jumper
Never payed attention to Beyonce before this. Good shit! 🔥
This is not country. Country has twang, this doesnt. I wish artists would stop trying to change country music into pop and R & B.
this is so nice
Not a fan and being half naked sure ain't country.
This isn’t even the heart of African American country music. The lyrics are not near close. Talking about a Lexus? Don’t be a bitch come take it to tha flo? Haha This is like if Eminem had his lyrics on a country music background. It’s terrible🦭
Go girl go .
The Queen
This in my opinion is horrible. I was getting dizzy. The same movement constantly!!!
WTF is this !!
Horrid influence on our girls. Disgusting!
Wow she makes all music her bitch!!!! Omg this just randomly played on my Alexa and it made me legit cry from how beautiful it was! Had 2 find the song and share on Facebook!!!!
Put some darn clothes on
I didn't know tornados could hit her city of New York 😅
Why does she have to be almost naked that’s not what country is about. The song isn’t bad, but her being almost naked is a shame or country
Hey its franklin
This is not country hahaha it’s a pop want to be song
She bit REYNA ROBERTS
Cultural appropriation?
Hey its Franklin... Coming to our house ...
She did a PHENOMENAL job with this song!!:) Texas Hold’Em 🎉
Let's see if she gets screwed out of her Grammy this shit bangs
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
Listen to this song is like listening to cow piss, not very enjoyable
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Black Hat is making this song hot - like every female today, Beyonce ruined it by over sex-ing it right at the start.
Beautiful song, wonderful artist performance, worst video ever...
Booby music
Sorry but this isn't country. And maybe wear appropriate clothing not half naked
Like the song but not her outfit…… That’s not country al all my opinion
Not a fan of country, and honestly can't name one Beyonce song. This is a nice sounding song, she has a good voice. Almost had Dolly Parton vibes in the beginning. But I'm old school, and the use of profanity ( very minor) turns me off from fully being able to enjoy the song. But that's me and my view.
So what is country about this?
🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢
This is trash lmao
Pure TRASH
Dumbist shit ever
People need to stop over crediting Beyonce she didn’t do anything new !   It’s already black singers in country that can sing way better than Beyonce ! Mickey Guyton , Allison Russel , Brittney Spencer yola  and Reyna Robert’s
Isn't this just Franklin the Turtle Theme Song? For those who know.....lolol
Is it country and can she sing? Yep.  Is it a good song? Nope.
Stupid video, but I absolutely loooove this song !  The guys and the one cowgirl type chick dancing to it are 🔥 too ❣️♥️
I love  this
Nope, not liking this at all.  😢
Lol. Nice PORN SHOW.
This is lazy
I don't like she shows too much  for her children and husband that's all
Delete this
This shit aint country she need to stay in her own fuckin lane this shit is makin fun of country music idk how you aloud this on here with her havin no ahirt and if u have a problem what i said then fafo
This song is absolute garbage.
Country music is a Black thing
Now she needs to make a rock song! I bet it would kick as*
Why’s she naked?
Not a big fan of this song
Overrated,  i dont care she makes horrible music
😢 0:29 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This is not country n the song sucks
Omg what has happened? Please sit down, country music is done!!!!!!! Can't unhear this crap
All she do is show her body 40 and haven’t grown a bit
This is NOT country, country is more than music it’s not something you can just take lol that’s about as bad as saying that you’re a girl when you’re actually a boy .Country was born in 1927 Bristol, Tennessee by some true country. i’m not sure what this was and Beyoncé you’re a grown woman cover yourself up have some dignity please 🙏
There's nothing Beyonce can't do. Black girl magic for the win. 🥰✨
La chanson est top, elle est au top! Mais par contre le clip bof, elle nous avait habitué à mieux 😒
love the song not the ending and the video is crap
🤢🤮
Such a predictable, boring , lack of creativity video for a possibly decent song. She has nothing else to offer but the same thing over and over.
Tolles Lied, langweiliges Video. Ganz schön eigebildet.
So where is the country song she came out with?
U ain’t country leave it to the pros
Texas hold'm love it
She needs to go back to destinys child, this is proper shite
The video makes zero sense . Also why is she half naked - it’s so overdone now . I like her music but it’s her again in tights - knickers and now her boobs are out. Where is the class ? If she couldn’t sing I would say she needs to seek herself but she can sing . Just tired of this image being used over and over .
Nice t#*ts. Other than that WTF is this garbage?
Flick it!
Your so crered Tina
Not country. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 nice try though. An entire video of you doing the same thing over and over. Oh wait I get it...... you desperate lmmfao😂😂
Anyone that thinks this is country needs to have their head examined. You probably also believe Biden got more votes than anyone in history and this song made it to number 1 due to actual country music lovers listening to this trash....
Complete garbage
Hooker Hoe'down!🤣
No thank you we don’t need this. None of this makes sense she’s so not relevant anymore. Why is she trying so hard at this point. 🙄 she’s so annoying
I absolutely can't stand Beyonce but this is catchy, and her best.
Put some clothes on b
Beyoncé is suchhhh a Baddddd Assss Bish💖💖🙏🏽🙏🏽
incredible all the records she's breaking with this amazing song!!!! about to be number 1 on BILLBOARD GLOBAL 200 and HOT 100!!!!
This was black music all along.
Love it! ❤
This does not sound like a country music song, sorry. Just because you call it a country music song doesn’t make it one. And why does everyone have to be nearly naked these days? We’ve seen it all already and honestly it’s boring at this point. Can ya be a little more creative?
Is the video glitching, or is she doing the same stupid thing over and over again for almost 4 minutes?
This ish sounds like old folk music.  I'm so over this lady,  just chill, will you please!
Not for me. Boring.
Beyonce is about as country as shakira...
This music is really bad
Si es country
I don’t get why she has to dress like that tho. How many other country artists are dressing like that?
I wonder how long she’ll focus on this genre? There are so many layers to explore it could really develop her sound to experiment there are moments in the song where it feels like she’s holding back gotta get into violins
❤❤👍
the amount of records this song has already broken globally is actually insane considering:  1) it was a surprise drop with 3 days of tracking  2) it’s a complete genre departure  3) the song has no physical copies, remixes, digital discounts, music video, live performance or interview discussing it 4) it’s a country song, by a black woman 5) beyoncé is over 30 years into her career  like wow. you deserve every bit of this success, i’m blown away. the industry rarely sees true global longevity like this, especially paired with continuous artistic evolution. go bey!!!!
this is so fkn garbage
Song is good but video is stupid.
This is awful 😂
Yea. this is not country. put it away beyoncé 😂 and don’t try and go into that genre buddy
Bey put 0 effort into this video and they are MAD!!! 😂😂😂
This song isn't as bad as some people are making it out to be......I kinda actually like it. Ijs
How is this country she's just sitting there half naked she could have done anything better than this crap I'll give it to her at least this song is not half bad
First country song I've listened to more than 5 sec😂😂😂
This is not country man. She’s naked…… it says good. It ain’t nothing country about this. What the fock lmao like at least have class. It slid. Aight but she has no country class. I would make sense if we had a true blakc country artist this shit is wacky
Lmao wtf
Man y’all playing this not country the song sucks now here comes the bees 😂
Sounds like Country to me.
Sounds much better than what country has been putting out lately.
Another stolen piece of music, this time from a cartoon. Franklin the Turtle--- since she hasn't written a single song, she has performed it makes sense.
Why is she naked,  porn is hiring.
Complete garbage
I hope Beyonce gets this message that looks totally ridiculous and uncalled for you are totally disrespectful and I mean totally
What a boring clip.
The song is not my jam but I’m glad she’s pushing boundaries. If nothing else then to use her fame and power to smash walls for the next generations.  I am curious what a rock song would look like from her
💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
This is literally the laziest music video ive ever seen 🤦🏻
Beyoncé大好き💕💕😘💕！
She has destroyed Kenny Rogers song Gambler because that's what this is a remake to
This song sucks
This song is complete crap. Stick with what you know. What a turd
❤❤❤
Hold meh Beer n past meh dat lil fiddle
Sounds like every other country song since George Strait left.  "Country music" has been pop for a long. long, long time.
She could sell this song without looking like a skank,
The music nice but the video is not  what country is country
Am I the only one to think that this song is garbage and she shouldn’t do country
Country and steampunk. Interesting.
Too much emphasis on this topic ... ALL she's doing is singing a song .......Stupid video ... WHY does she have a cover-up on ..??? That's Not real country .... just my opinion 😊😅...
I can say the facts as i know but taught country came from African Americans just look at your hero's movie of Elvis thats when I  remember hearing it but yes the song is trash sounds like my grandkids wrote it.
Why is She always half Naked?😮
Its sped up "franklin the turtle" btw
Ive listened to Beyonce since destiny child, never once thought "yeah, she should make a country song" Still nope, dumb af
I love Beyoncé, but K. Michelle is the queen of black country music. She sounds like the black Dolly Parton if y’all haven’t checked it out please I’m waiting on them to the collaterals together cause it’s gonna be awesome.
So, now black people need to quit complaining about culture appropriations. Sick of it and also, she looks really nasty with no clothes on. It would have been kinder to actually wear clothes. Jay z is pi ing his wife really bizarre. Trust what their ex security guard said it is all truth dirty stuff with these two
Simple  : franklin la tortue 🐢
What does  her out has to do with  country music   but Lyrics Is wonderful
Ya may not like it, but this is more country than the pop they're singing with a twang, tryna pass it off as country...sorry.
Wannabe country 😆 Beyonce is very talented, but this don't work.
This doesn’t sound like country. Plus I can’t put my nose on it but it sounds exactly like a song from a decade ago. Someone help me out with this.. like I know for a fact I’ve heard this same music or something nearly exactly similar
Not country but also not bad.
not bad
I like this!!
Why
Half naked as usual
It’s ok.
Disgusting  Just come out in nothing already  🤮🤮🤮
Weird this comes out now.. election year from very liberal Biden supporters about Texas….. Ooh, one step to the right We headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice
This song is great song and would have been even better if she got dressed. Why women these days have to be half naked for their shows. Kinda sad. Are they afraid they won't be successful if they don't dress like this???Just wondering.
Deci eu chiar nu mai ascult pana nu faci cover dupa orice piesa de-a lui Hozier!
Ugh
You never count your money When you're sittin' at the table
This is shit and definitely not country
She sounds terrible
Love this song: She is from Texas: It is her home town music: Besides nobody owns music:it is for everyone to share
Money tight everywhere
Let the music play  Roy hamilton
Also does she have to dress so cheap that is why men look at you like a toy
As a southern country loving god fearing American I like the song . Wish she didn’t swear though it’s tacky .
She is from Texas so they can say what they want U go B🐝🇦🇬🇺🇸😚
🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
NOPE!  NOPE!! NOPE !!!  Beyonce is no country girl.
THIS IS SO GOOD. :)
Um, jiha I guess?
This song is straight ass
This would be good if she took the pop trashy outfit out of it and wore jeans boots oh AND a SHIRT . I absolutely grossed out by her outfit
Don't see why White people hate this song but it is what it is
Girl, you ain’t getting album of the year no matter how country you wanna sing. Should’ve started with this in your career, then maybe you would have been considered. OMG where’s Taylor, come crush this girl and get another albums of the year. Desperate Haters can hate. By the way, it’s a black girl writing this, so it’s not about a race thing. Nakedness everywhere, you failed at it again! Cover up and stop selling black women as if they’re all about sex.
Garbage
If it was an independent artist that had 1000 followers on Facebook no one would care, you only care because it’s weyonce the white lady
What I find sad is all the people or as they call themselves melanin queens can write a comment only to use "yt" for white/Caucasians but make sure they spell the entire word of black or like i stated previously melanin queens describing themselves. Where is the respect. Even more hilarious is I saw comments saying how country music  was created by the melanin community (the same as braids, light bulbs etc) but yet they've done nothing but denounce it, make jokes on it UNTIL now that Beyonce makes a song considered in the genre of country music now the story can be written to suit their narrative.  I'm not a country music fan but I don't trash talk it, I'm not a fan of Beyonce but i don't trash talk about her. I give her credit as well as those with talent before her. Just be kinder  I already know the comments are coming, I hear computer typing and the negativity raining down on me. But I still have wthe ultimate ounc
This is a good song but imagine being Jay z with his wife wearing that.
This does not sound like country nor does she even has a country accent. I don't care for this.
Kenny Rogers does it better.. she just copied him. That's why she can't win the album of the year, she is not original
Visto per curiosità. Sinceramente non ci vedo nulla di speciale...
Love it!  But Beyonce your soo beautiful and a Momma, cover up a bit, I don't want to see your boobs
Song is ok... video sucks😂😂😂
What a boring video!
Absolutely disgusting she doesn’t hide the satanic bullshit anymore !!
Terrible
Beyond offensive.
welcome to country folks
Freizügiger geht's wohl nicht, da kann sie gleich nackt auftreten.
I could live with the song…the ENTIRE VIDEO SUCKED ASS…then again…
I really liked the song. But now I have put my eyewash in. So girl,  - those are taped up tatas. Store bought not God given - now we know you shave your puddie nearly off - now we know you have enough brain cells left to blow smoke off a pretend gun. I'm so impressed.
That feeling you get when watching the first round of American Idol. 🤔
Nice. She should do more Country music.
lol long way from being Country Music. Not even close. No steel , banjo or the Nashville sound even. Sorry but no.
Sad. For the love of money...
Classy outfit🥴
Combination of slave music and country.  Bad to have to result to using the bitch word. Could've done better.
My morning routine jam as for now until further notice
Seriously; 🤮
It must have cost at least $75 to make that video.
Oh come on B-just come out topless you are anyway-then tell Blue ivy in a few years to keep her clothes onnnnnn.......
Awesome she is sexualizing women in country music … I get it men still get blame for this
Does she have to it naked?
Bro put some clothes on and stop cursing its country music just go back to r&b or rap if you wanna do this
Help me ! Ich bekomme einen Tinnitus 😂 Es klingt schrecklich, abartig, grauenvoll 😂 My Husband-Musicprofi hat schon 500.000 Musiktitel gehört, aber bei dem "Gejammer", löst sich bei ihm nicht der Schmalz im Ohr 😂 Dank Youtube, gibt es noch den anderen, besseren Music Sound, für das verwöhnte Trommelfell 😊
😂😂Not impressed Didn’t like it and there wasn’t anything country about it.😂😂 She’s trying to be someone she’s not 😂😂 Stop already. You’ll never be half as good as Dolly or Taylor. Beyoncé is at bottom of the totem pole tied for last place with J Lo.
Mmmmmmm I’ve listened a few times and I’m not a fan 😅
This isn't even county. Just because the beat it, doesn't mean she is. Lol her same singing on a country beat. Not #1 it's a popularity contest please.😂
Love it 😁
Put some clothes  on what a roll model
Disgusting
Garbage pop country
Only Beyonce could cross over to country and make sound guitar good. ❤
Don't get why she has to be half naked to promote her Country music.... Should have some respect!!! 🤨
She knocked this one out of the park! Country fan my whole life. Texas born….❤
This is absolutely pure 100% without a doubt the worst piece of 💩 she's made to date.
This is soooo goood❤
This is not country music
She is so disrespectful to the country music. So dirty, she should go back to where she came from
This video is a disgraceful display of megalomania and the song is bad. I really expected so much more from Beyoncé.  Hard pass on all of it.
Love the song but do not like the video.  What is with the indecency!!!
Pure studio cheese.  I'm not a serious fan of country/western, but over the years I've taken a liking to some... Parton, Nelson, The Band, etc.  Sorry, but this doesn't cut it with me.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This that "country music" for bitches who reuse pads, don't shower during their periods, and whipe back to front 🥱🤡
Get outta here. You are talented but you are not a country artist.
It's not the worst song she has, but it's definitely not her best. This song is only hyped because of it being Beyonce 🙄
Them ppl mad now 😅
Shes not a country singer
Country music started with louisianna blues. Glad you're back B ❤
She’s talking about heading to the basement and surviving (BUNKERS FOR THE RICH) she ain’t worried about us 😢
She just ghettoized country music
https://www.youtube.com/@nathyofficielJ1402/?sub_confirmation=1❤❤❤
"Again I am basing my comments and opinion on her video "...with this new so-called country style song that's what I call it! This is- not a country artist..ok, she is- singing words at some point that refer to country...& some of you are commenting on her dance moves in this video,ok... I viewed it a dozen times ... If I'm correct to my knowledge," she walks in on the video," she's doing like a catwalk😺 and then she stands there doing a gun finger move, with sparkel shine dust coming from her fingers... she doesn't even have a real gun," she might have a gun holster and did she forget her brassiere (or )a shirt ... It's okay to be sexy," but come on leave some things to the- imagination( or) leave it in the bedroom with her husband...again what is her point- in the so-called country style change,in her- video..." Like I said.." I've viewed this video a dozen times & dozen of times...   " Yes she sing's in a different style, it just sounds more of a girly pop song...she can dance,yet where is she dancing in this video,let's be honest, she can- definitely walk in on this video and she looks like she's 😺 cat walking ( or )molding herself, yes she can sing,yet not a real COUNTRY ARTIST,ok she's- apparently from Texas," hey I'm from the country, was born &   raised in the country,worked on a Family Farm & real country artists music 🎶 is  written,song from the heart💓their music style, lyrics flow natural ...she seems to have tried to attempt,calling this song ,"COUNTRY" yet like every one's own comments (opinion) ... at a young age l always listen to Country music, artist,l opened up to listen to Country,Soul,Jazz,,Rap,POp,The Oldies,etc...love listening 🎧 & learning of different types, styles,weather it be White, Asian  Black, lndien,, Mexican music artists ... everybody's has a talent,yet somethings sound different to others,why does it at times,as some people,have to make it about , haters (or) race...like l share in all my comments,At the end of the day...

Peace to all✌️
act i - house, disco, ballroom act ii - country, bluegrass, folk. act iii - rock, blues, jazz.  thank you for reclaiming historically black art forms, beyoncé. thank you for always paying homage to the past, crediting and paying people, and pushing the culture forward.   those of us who get it, will ensure that your sacrifices will never be in vain. i love and appreciate you so much! 38 years and you’re just getting started ❤️
Not country, no band and tits out...wonder why it's #1?
So, it's obvious the optics are creating the buzz. Nothing says it's a hit more than a woman strutting around naked throwing her crotch in your face. There's a reason these singers do this. Maybe one day it will be based on singing ability and not look at me!
Did not think I'd actually say this but I actually like it?!..
Love love love this!!!!
Shit is trash tf is this
Beyonce remaking the Franklin intro is meh
IM GOING TO LIE, THIS IS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Boring video wow
Ok I gave the song an honest listen. That is not country music. It gets filed in the Corny genre & I ain’t scared of you BeeHive, I will pull your lil stingers, poke you in the eye & run 😂 🗑️
The video was… kinda mesmerizing
Put clothes on... the song would be just as good, if not better.
Ummm is there more to the video
I love this song because black folks used to be all in country music, but we’ve been so popular in other genres! Now you all know they mad because of the backlash from small town…so now they will hate on this! LOL let them hate!
Go GURL
Catchy tune. Dumb video. My opinion.
Michelle O said Beyonce is a roll mode o girls...some roll model...
LAME VIDEO.   GREAT SONG BETTER THAN HER CRAP.
Hee haw from San Antonio, Texas 🤠 🛻 🏈
This is not country music!
Hahah this is too funny this is not country music.
I'm a Texan. She's a Texan. But it still sounds like pop. Pop country I suppose. She's got roots in it Chile. Let her sing! Stop gatekeeping. Music is for everyone.
This girl...,please someone tell her it's ok not to show her boobs and make suggestive naughtiness with every song she makes!  She's got the voice a good shape and some great music but please honestly you don't need to show the world you need more attention to your body when your vocals are enough!  We're not shallow so you don't have to be either....
Zero talent promoting gun violence through the objectivication of her body...once again  - boring.  Insult to the genre of country music.
BOY DOES THIS SUCK
ABOUT TO BE NUMBER 1 ON THE BILLBOARD HOT 100!!!
She needs to put some clothes on. I like the song but please put some clothes on
those chords and harmonic shifts at the endddddd..... what is it going into??? what comes next???
Another stinker from a stinky artist
Thus video is dumb tjough
Congratulations. You stole the guitar part from the 90's tv show "Franklin"
The ignorance in this thread is abounding.  Check the history of the origin of this country and country western.  Its quite interesting.
Queria tanto um clipe 😢😢😢
I love how people are saying black people are reclaiming country music when it stems from Irish and Scottish music.
This song is trash. Not country just because the instrumentals. K michelle is way better
I feel sorry for her kids. Can you imagine your mom dressed like that. I would die of embarrassment.
it sounds like a gretchen wilson song
Unter Country versteh ich was anderes 👎🏼
⭐️🇺🇸Capitol Texas! …  God bless Beyonce  for her tune and talent and God bless the good Patriots of 🇺🇸America…and the world  and  the world and bless the two stepping Cowboys and Cowgirls.  Let’s keep dancing!  Keep those vibes high, our prayers strong.  Much love to all❤
I See her and Dolly soon...
😂😅😂😅😂 what a stupid song!!! The lyrics are ridiculous.  Not deep at all. Country music has depth, this is pop not Country... Lol.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That ain't country music. Sorry, ya'll. 😢 That's not good. Plus....trashy looking. Vulgar!
Just another attempt to stay relevant any way that they can, hollywood is weird
Could have been a good song if the video wasn’t so stupid.  She’s disgusting
This will never be country music.
If she is trying to make country music she has a voice for it but her video about country needs work on I love my country music and welcome her to the country side
Terrible like all her music lol
I think you owe Franklin some money
There’s a simple solution to some of these peoples problem with Beyoncés song just don’t listen to it 😩😂 and keep your negative comments to yourself it’s not that deep..love you Mrs Carter❤️👸🏽🐝
Lmao😂😂😂
Just because you talk about country things does not make your song country
Listen to SZA this is garbage SZA JS DROPPED HER SONG SATURN ITS WAY BETTER TRUST ME
Because of course the queen bey can, without effort dominate even country music! Xoxo
More a pop song than country but okay.
Ok ya this shit sucks can't even call it a country song
boring song video
I’m not into country music. I’m here because I support Beyoncé and love her so much 🖤
Definitely not my kind of country, not what I'm used to anyway 😞 That being said, thank goodness we're on a PUBLIC platform and we're all entitled to our own OPINIONS 💁🏼‍♀️ 😉
Not country.
If you think this is a country song....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WTF IS THIS!? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I mourn for Country Music. Tell this bogus backwater bogart to stay in her lane and leave Country TF alone. She's obviously terrible at it
Howdy B! ❤
Beyonce ain't got no business doing country see the stay in your lane she's a bitch for even making😂😅
It sounds a lot like the Canadian cartoon…a lot https://youtu.be/qG2jMm7ku50?feature=shared
Is there a non-jive version available?
Silly 😂
Ngl......this sucks lol
it’s Dolly approved, and as a hillbilly that’s all that matters 🤣
The Song is beautiful but I don't like the video
Great song so what are they complaining about??? Great singer
the seam goes down the back of the leg.
There’s something about this song that doesn’t…match. It sounds like a badly blended salad. Like the flavors don’t go with each other.
This ain’t country music 🤬
What the heck it's that
https://youtu.be/DI3Hac-e7Xc?si=u9vb4txhaEOHtyQ6
Texas is the most POWERFUL state in USA. And Beyonce is a STRONG TEXAN WOMAN!!!
Well considering the blacks say white people doing rap music is  "cultural appropriation" I call this the same lmao 😂 country ain't been country for decades.
I hate this song
fake country
She just ruined Country Music being half naked.. DISGUSTING
Why do RnB singers have to ruin everything
This is "country" how?? Is it because you name a song with "Texas" in it that makes it country??
There's a new sheriff in town and her name is Beyoncé. I like the way she sings country. And if Dolly Parton says it's country that settles it right there. Pulled me right in! And wow Bey has never looked better!  😎🤠😎
She could reclaim women wearing clothes
Trash
It makes you think that being half naked wld have been the only way to sell this song cause I dont under the visual next to the lyrics.
This has nothing to do with the real blues or country. Read the words.
Now Koreans of seul do the same thing but much better according to their point of view  , rajaraja
Ewwww
This ain’t no country 💀 her outfit and everything
icky
love her!!
I don't like it. Nothing to do with her doing country that's fine. She is a country gal. I just ain't feeling it.
Yeah nawwwww
That's not country music.
I’ll pass! 😖
Ok wtf is this trash
I think this is a great song and it should be in the pop category because it is no where near country music or style. I already know that a lot of people are gonna disagree with me. I agree, it is a great song once again.
Beyoncé is so beautiful! 😍🥰
...are you serious...???
This is NOT COUNTRY ANYTHING and I love her usually !
I'm glad Beyonce is reclaiming black genres...so they gon try to say rap is yt too
It kinda sounds like the Franklin cartoon intro.
How utterly sad. If she wants to sing a Country song then do so with clothes on, no vulgarity and about genuine, relatable emotions. Uplift. Don't wallow in the endless mire of modern culture. The impressionable young people who listen to this garbage will likely never be exposed to music that is meaningful and sung by adults. May the Dear Lord forgive us.  Acts 2:40. We can and should do better.
Wow this is bad
It's catchy, but whatever she is wearing on her eyes doesn't work for me. She has an incredible body though.
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
You go, girl, you really know what you are doing. Singing like a country song should sound like coming from a black woman. Don't let anyone else tell you that song isn't rocking. I can't wait to hear it again. Now get stepping and show how to dance to that awesome track 👣. ❤🎉😊
Not even country sorry….
HORRIBLE!!!!!
Instantly,, right off the bat. Symbolism. Transhumanism, man and machine suggestive programming. Left eye covered.. all stop. I won’t watch any more of this. All piggy backed on a catchy song . Also, this ain’t roots country. It’s superficial pop country. Late! Also, why her tits out?
It's not country but it's fun & catchy. Get it girl.
Everyone saying this is a good song doesn’t have good taste in music, sorry not sorry…
Excellent song for Beyonce, Stupid ass video love to hear Rhiannon Gibbons on Banjo.
Why does she has to show her boobs?  She is beautiful but doesn’t have to constantly showing this.  It’s annoying. I want to hear the lyrics not looking at her boobs.
Taylor beat her twice switching genre now shes trying to beat Taylor by switching genres this ain't it beyonce was done after her 1st solo album
Just come out naked , you almost are lol
I actually like this , it's got a nice little bounce to the rythem
This is garbage and it's definitely not country. 🙄 The beyhive will defend anything she does.
This video would be better if it wasn’t a call for help from a different genre. The video is her half topples shooting finger guns. Why not make a fun dance out of it. She choreographed many songs.  This tune had so much potential. What a loser.  This was one day in a studio. two hours shooting finger guns and two hours mimicking classic music.  What a paycheque.
This is garbage
I’ve never seen anybody in the country driving a Lexus
satanic video, jesus is king
This ain't Texas (ooh) Ain't no hold 'em (hey) So lay your cards down, down, down, down So park your Lexus (ooh) And throw your keys up (hey) Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (stick around) And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you Come pour some sugar on me, honey too It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo, ha There's a tornado (there's a tornado) In my city (in my city) Hit the basement (hit the basement) That shit ain't pretty (shit ain't pretty) Rugged whiskey (rugged whiskey) 'Cause we survivin' ('cause we survivin') Puffin' red-cup kisses, sweet redemption, passin' time, yeah Ooh, one step to the right We headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice Ooh, run me to the left Then spin me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind This ain't Texas (oh) Ain't no hold 'em (hey) So lay your cards down, down, down, down So park your Lexus (ooh) And throw your keys up (hey) Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (stick around) And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you Come pour some sugar on me, honey too It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you Come pour some liquor on me, honey too It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo There's a heatwave (there's a heatwave) Comin' at us (comin' at us) Too hot to think straight (too hot to think straight) Too cold to panic (cold to panic) All of the problems Just feel dramatic (just feel dramatic) And now we're runnin' to the first bar that we find, yeah Ooh, one step to the right We headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice Ooh, you run to the left Just with me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind This ain't Texas (oh) Ain't no hold 'em (hey) So lay your cards down, down, down, down (oh) So park your Lexus (hey) Throw your keys up (hey) Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (stick around) And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you Come pour some sugar on me, honey too It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you Come pour some liquor on me, honey too It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown Don't be ass, come take it to the floor now, ooh Take it to the floor now, ooh (oops, spurs, boots) To the floor now, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (tap back, oops, shoot) Come take it to the floor now, ooh And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you Baby, pour that sugar and liquor on me too (spurs, spurs, boots) Sologenic, photogenic, shoot
Am I the Only person that Noticed Beyonce sampled some of this song from the classic Doug Cartoon ?? lol
What is she wearing?! 😳
Just awful
Didn't cost much to make that video.
Trash
This is a country as a Park Avenue penthouse.
Dolly Parton ?
Gotta give it to her… just consistently puts out songs even worse than the ones before.  Impressive.
I mean it's fine and all, but the cult of Queen B is delusional, as all cults tend to be, and treat her like she's got the Midas touch with every release.  She could fart in a can and yall would call it pure genius
Beyonce is reminding the country community that black people is all in country music and also she spreading shine on the black country artists that don't shine because the color of their skin do it queen bey let the country community know that
Dear Beyonce— Please put on some clothes like a grown woman.  Thank you.
Not a country song just cause you put country words in it and the video for this is just disgusting. Nothing country about it.
Stay in pop cause not even a taste of real country!
I love it!
Hell country aint country anymore and this is at least as good as what's played today.
So tired of Beyonce always doing videos that focus on her body more than anything. Sure be sexy BUT when her selling her sex is always first and foremost then it dilutes her talent.
Keyboard warriors hatin on Queen Bee🐝 because shes versatile ✅👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Love love love the Queen 🐝
Franklinnnnnn
This is ridiculous! Not country, and might as well be naked!
She is the 🐐 number 1 in country song 🎵
What's with the mad max left eye thing? Good song..bad video
🥱🥱🥱 Love her music…this song, not so much.
She has NOTHING on Chapel Hart
No catching my interest in the country world
Video lacks creativity. Overall, lackluster at best.
Wow, this was not country lol. I would call it garbage!
This is as country as jennifer lopez is tejano 🙄
Instant wedding reception classic.   But, this is a great song. <3
Is she even black anymore?
Somebody thought this was country music 😂😂😂 laughing all the way to the bank . #1 Billboard
Beyonce covers a Lumineers song.  I dig it!
Another genre ruined
Why is the whole video just a 10 second clip on a loop??
F***k the music video, dressings and Music industry.
The vocals are great, but what's with the rewinded walk and shoot performance with an open jacket, her breast practical 90% out and her panties showing😮😞😓🤦🏽‍♀️ I wish she would have picked another way/video of starting off her country album.
This is garbage. She knows nothing of country music. Stay in your lane lady. And I use ,lady, very loosely.
This is the stupidest video I think I've ever seen. Definitely not real country.
country hip hop reggae r&b it really does not matter as long as it sounds good -this song sounds good
She definitely won't be getting a Grammy now 😂
THE SONG IS GOOD, BUT THE VIDEO IS TERRIBLE, YECH
I don’t like how it is the same clip every time like she comes out and shoots the gun and then again
put a shirt on double stick tape can only handle so much. who is stealing whose culture now?
put some clothes on girl.. we also dont say bitch in country music ..
💖💖💖💖💖
Is she trying to swap with T Swift?
Stupid video & song!
Yea, but can she rap like Ben Shapiro?😂
I just listened to it for the first time. The only thing not making this country enough for people period I think is her voice ain’t got no twang. I wrote that correctly, yes. Most singers fake the Twang. The song is about not faking or holding back, telling simply where you come from. She is from Texas. She faced the tornados, went to the bars. It is real. The music is real. I loved it.
Sucks
Is it just me or is she getting more naked each time I see her advertised..,
wack
Not a fan of this & I love Beyoncé.
Another pop song that will be popular for a month.....
Beautiful I love it Sometimes beautiful stars fly closer to heaven then most think. ❤
9+ million views and only 250 thousand likes. I can only imagine the dislike number.
I like the singing, but the song does little for me, it is just so-so.
I can't stop listening
Umm, Franklin theme song with new lyrics!
She. Should go back pop and stay THERE!!
Garbage gets picked up outside on mondays
I love Beyoncé but this ain’t it.
This is not country
Reclaiming?  Everything is not about color or black & white. Beyonce is simply giving us her contribution to the genre.  Being that she's from Texas, I'm sure there is much country music she's enjoyed.  At the root of it all Beyonce is a Western Southern woman
The Lumminers
This is country! I hope she makes more country songs. 👢
Beyonce please stick to your kind of music cause country ain't for you terrible song 👎
Very disappointed on how she protrays this song in those clothes terrible video 😮
Dress like this no plses 😮
This is terrible. Just terrible. Stick to pop rap.
WARNING: This song may expose traces of racism in you by way of your comment(s)
Don't hate...appreciate! Be......yonce!
There is nothing country at all about this song!
RIP country music! This is no more country than I am an astronaut!
This song is so bad. What the heck has the world come to….. 😢
If this is country then Bruce Jenner is a woman
Why is she half naked? Why do women always resort to this?  Is this the whole video or are they just replaying the same part over and over?
Sorry but she does not the voice for country music.
Uh Not Country
🗑️🗑️🗑️
More power  to her! Just showing her varsity  in choosing a hit!
By all means this is no where close to country music…
Clown. A lot of thought into that video. Country, joke.
Queen Beyonce at it again. The song and dance challenge are so fun!
Come on better country music than this crap 💩
It’s got to be and amazing feeling to be at the heights of your career and even still keep building and be able to explore different sides of yourself …
This is not good.
She took the beat from Franklin the Turtle!!! A Canadian child's cartoon!!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was never really into country, but after listening to this I’m still not into country
Bro this is not country💀
Why destroy the country image..smh
I don’t get the video with the song. The video just seems like wasted matetial but I love the song
The visuals don't give me country.... pretty disappointing
Visualizer? Of what? Body?
Loaded fake #1. This sounds nothing like country.
Hey its franklin
She will never be country!!!! Idk why she is trying!!!! She should just stick to pop and stop being like Taylor swift!!!!
Tell that to the CMA they are the ones who says what’s country and what’s not 😂
Welpt Bey you did it girl. I'm so proud of you. Your song is more country than any of the other country songs on the radio right now. I love people uploadin content of them doing the two step.  I didn't thingk the powers that be would budge but the people spoke and demanded that the song be played. It' sounds great and I hope there will be more. Music is the answer to bringing this divided country together if people will just listen and stop judgeing who's doing it. It shouldn't matter. I don't care who you are if your music is good it should be supported and not limited to these catagories. Like I said before if other people can do hip hop and r & B  we should be able to do country if we want with no backlash as long as its good. Keep going girl. You are a force. They can't stop you and one day soon you will have album of the year even if its a country album. That's right you will be the first. Why not. I will continue to chant for you.  You will beat them at their own game. You are like Michael Jackson's song Unbreakable.  Listen to those lyrics Bey. That's what inspires me everyday to keep rising to the Top....Love & Light.
cultural appropriation! 😜
I think i' would've kept the song clean and a few dancers doing a little country line dancing in a line bar, having fun, then go to a country gathering at night in the woods on four wheelers, with family, friends maybe have the dancers end it with dancing with everyone dancing in a shallow mud pit with the whole family having fun throwing mud and end it with beyonce looking at a love interest male. Just food for thought selling another view point instead of of one video sexualizing her walking in high heels.
Listen to some 80s country. Crossover is a thing.
Why does she always have to be half naked all the time in her videos. Love the song though.
So basically she lost her popularity and she can't win awards so turn to sex sells lmaoo
This video is dumb. The same thing over & over? What a waste of time
This is whack. !!!! She is being dirty. The new black country girl singers songs are better than this. I see why they didn't want to play it on some of the country stations. All about money. Smdh
Not country !!!!!
I like country music, boring video!
@justbrewing ja und wer hat dich denn gefragt
This is awful.    No story to the song at all,  just a bunch of country buzzwords.       Trash.
This crap ain't country.... it's crap.
Yes Beyoncé I love it sing 🎤 🐝❤️🐝❤️🐝❤️🐝❤️🐝
Lmao redefining commonly understood terms again
Why is she practically naked 😂
Dont ruin country. Evil agenda.
Trash don't even call this country music!! This is throw up!!
That is the worst excuse for a country song that I have ever heard, not to mention all the  cussing in there! It's completely official now, country music is dead! And country music has never been anything to do with black people, y'all just got to try to make everything yours don't you? Let y'all tell it you invented everything, but music itself was not created by black people and nobody is perfect!
Cultural appropriation lmfao this isn't country. Its wannabe
Not interested. She is equivalent to a talking head
Globalists who run the music business are trying to hijack country.  Total respect for Darius and Keb and others but not trusting this move much.
Acoustic instruments doesn’t make it country.  This definitely isn’t country.
This was genuinely terrible....But not gonna lie, I dig the visual lol.
This ain't country music.
Love the song and I'm not a country fan. But. Who produced this video??? Lazy, lazy, lazy. Beyonce is one of the great performers but seeing the same visual endlessly repeated doesn't add anything to the song. In fact, it takes away from it. So, I'll listen from now on but not bother to watch.
That’s not country. It’s a country track on top of her usual prostitute-dirty language gimmick. It would’ve been nice to see a real country song with deep lyrics and relevant topics. I remember the days when Beyoncé didn’t have to curse or be a hoe to sell her music.
Love it!!! Wow!!!❤
What kind of a video is this? Am I missing something?
Shit!
this is NOT country, this is pop the same shit she always plays
Why cant she perform without showing her skin, eh? Lol
I'm confused as usual. I think I like it?
This is NOT country nusic
This sux! Not at all good!
This is truly garbage, she needs to be embarrassed with this one
ok, I like it.
Beyonce looks trashy in this video more than ever 👎 Yikes she done sold her soul for sure.
NOT COUNTRY
Just stop. Stay in your lane. This isn't country, this is straight crap. And wtf is this "outfit"? Fire that stylist
Corny as always. So what are we trying to do.
Beyonce is not country and never will be. She thinks she can be everything. She needs to stick with the black panthers because this video needs to be banned because it sucka dick.
😆
I don’t know why people don’t like this as it sounds just like “Fancy Like”, and y’all loved that song.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Yeah nah what a terrible song & video
The only country song I like lmao 😂
When you finally beat RED DEAD REDEMPTION.....
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT SO! AGAIN GIRL--"YOU BE THAT BITCH" BABY! THE ONE & ONLY--FREAKIN BEY! Y-E-A-H!
Tiddays 👌🏾
Is Country dressing that way these days?  Gees!
You black folk really do believe y'all created everything huh. I'm sorry but y'all DID NOT  create country but it's ok y'all got hip hop and r&b you'll be ok.
Wtf
Bruh Beyoncé needs to get back in her lane. This is NOT country music!!! Go back to pop music girly
Ok beyswift
She's trying to keep up with Taylor Swift
Beyonce is doing country thats so awesome all we need is her to bring back disco ❤
Dolly approved…hillbillies losing their cookies.
Why is there hate for this?
One eye covered, baphomet hand gestures.
Nice hand gestures. Wake up people.
Hate the outfit.  Disgraceful!   Don’t like the song.
Beyoncé is great and all but I literally can not wait for all of the little country cover girls to rip the hell out of this song. She’s walking so small town country girls with guitars can run.
The back track is a bit cliche/corny. Hopefully the non singles are better.
The term "country" is used way too loosely these days
Actual crap!
horrible
Country music is black music!
I don’t understand the hype
This song is NOT GOOD. It’s NOT the worst country tune ever I’ll assume, but it’s just not a good song.🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
No
Embarrassing 😳 never 👎
Not a fan. Dressing like a h o, still doesn't sound country. This ain't country and she needs to stay in her lane
É ELA! “Texas Hold 'Em” de Beyoncé está prevista para subir para o 1º lugar na Billboard Global 200, com quase 60 milhões de streams ao redor do mundo.   Será sua primeira entrada em 1º lugar na parada de sua carreira.
Just a pop song with stupid box ticking lyrics about whisky and hoe downs. Pathetic
I hate country. But this is actually good. Now I hate country a little less.
This is horrible
This sum Illuminati shit
THIS AINT TEXAS..........THIS IS HTOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.........3RD WARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....MUCH LUV B........TIMELESS ARTIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Look who is race stealing white People's music sing about big rims and doing drugs leave the country music to real country people
Beyonce is a product. There is plenty of better music out there if you prefer authenticity in your entertainment.
Nope not something she's really good at
Guys… this isn’t country💀
This song sounds like what someone that's never actually heard country music thinks country music sounds like. Its fucking terrible. Still with your pop bs and leave country music alone!
That's a black woman that wants to be white with a blonde hair and the video to make her look like she's white omg what a joke
This is not country, its pop with a twang...
Does she have Villa Lago like Michael Jackson cuz why does she look very white haha can't beat em join them haha
That’s five minutes I’ll never get back. Terrible
I actually like it! It’s ok for a first try. I’d rather hear her do her type music.
Nope . Doesn't sound authentic.
Gospel album. Wear that to church.
Country? That’s cute.   I can’t believe it took six people to write this song 😂
Everyone needs to quit classifying music … a good song is a GOOD SONG! This is catchy and fun  Good for you girl ! Git er dun!
Joke
She needs to put a shirt on...dang...
Something doesn't smell right. Under the surface there's a sickness lurking...
BORING
This is sick this is not country music
Blues and gospel are the roots of country, this is neither of those either. Not country, and yes I'm white but I've always celebrated where the music originally came from. Go listen to Kokomo Arnold, that's real country roots, blues. This is pop trash.
Love me some Bey! but that, let's not sexualize women thing aint workin here, LOL
I don't hate it but I wouldn't say this counts as true country music. It's definitely a catchy song though.
🤦🏻‍♀️
I love the sound of silencers maybe my dad will leave his to me someday lol
She should have done this a long time ago ❤
🤣🤣🤣 Did she SERIOUSLY release THAT as a country song???
Since when is country music black 😂😂😂
Is this a joke?
How is this even classified as country ?
BEAUTIFUL BEYONCE
It is Franklins theme song
In all honesty, what straight man is paying attention to any of the words to that song but instead watching her almost naked but is supposed to be country? I would love to hear what someone like Minnie Pearl or Pasty Cline would say about this insult to pure country music.
This is horrible.
“I’ve always had a soft spot for Beyoncé” - 👴🏻
"This is NOT,NOT Country, the song sounds like the theme to where 's Franklin "...where's is Lainey Wilson ",That's A - True,True Country artist and stylish lady" , Lainey Wilson always dresses with dignity and pride ,she is a excellent role- model for the  women,younger generation who's getting into country music,going to still win votes- based on her True country roots and lyrics," she wins in her music style with her natural beauty" and strong song lyrics ,wonderful singing, her true beauty shines on, "she doesn't win votes- by putting her body out there, "where is Taylor Swift.".. That's right she's on tour,"...❤too Taylor & Laney❤... Keep, keep shining ladies... "👎Beyonce stick to your old style 👎
lol this sounds like crap
I absolutely love this song, but WTF can we see her boobs?
Put some fucking clothes on! 😒
This ain’t COUNTRY !!! The SONG SUCKS AND THE VIDEO IS EVEN WORST 🤮🤮🤮🤮 she needs to retire
This is propaganda to degenerate “country culture”
I have to say it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that I believe Beyonce switched genres as a money grab. And to me that already dilutes the feeling of the music and the connection of the music to the artist and the audience. I hate to say it but why not just stick with what you know and expand on that. If she's getting bored that music can go in many different directions. And this certainly is not because she's black going into country music because I feel the same way about white artists who are rock and roll performers and then want to put out a country song or an R&B song for a  money grab.
Is anyone hip to Willie Jones?? Look him up y'all!!
🤣🤣😂😂 GTFOH . The Beehive will be the only ppl to support this garbage !
Isso ficou tão lindo, mãe ❤️😍 Te amo
It's a pop song
thumbs down lol IMO
Sounds Good!!!
This isn’t country! This is the biggest insult to country music and she needs to be thrown in the bin to even THINK shes anywhere near country music. Can’t stand her as it is.
Did you all run out of money to make the rest of a video. 🤷‍♀️
Garbage
LMAO 😂
Honestly one of the best songs I've heard in a long time, can't wait for the album.
She sucks
There isn't much "county music" anymore. It's mostly Nashville crap.
It’s sounds like the cartoon “Franklin”… it’s the same tune as Franklin… 😂😂😂
This is not count one country music, and the video is just one continuous loop of her showing her boobs. The song is okay but it is not counrty.

Cadê os brasileiros nos comentários 🤦🏼‍♂️🤔🤔
She is good at singing but she not doing in thing in the video
This video of her , IT IS VERY TACKY! No!!!!
Porn show.1 dollar.Never want to hear it again.
That is so not country!  But your absolutely beautiful!
This is fusion.  Not pure country.
Weak.
She just needs to cover up.  Song is alright. Visuals no so much
Dolly Parton said its country, and any country fan knows that you don’t back sass meemaw.
unimpressed. too low budget.
Am i the only one who does hear the Franklin themed song
Suyun ısındı senin
What a rubbish video
Personally I f I could do one thing to save the world ( besides sending the entire gop to Mars) is to ban cou try music . Why ? because if they stopped singinging that crap maybe their wives and digs would go home  But BEYONCE NAILED this and any RACIST COUNTRY STATION who won't play her song is STUPID because this is great and will be a money maker
I'm from the hills of Tennessee... This ain't no damn country!!! She looking fine tho 🤔😁
Vile
His name was Charlie pride..he was very good 💯 and handsome at that!!!!
❤
Country?  I think not...👎
Country folks be grateful some of us are listening thinking we been missing on country
It takes some REAL ⁰ talent to steal the intro song to Franklin! 😂😂😂
This is the worst official video ever. I was hoping we were going to see Beyonce like in the Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, outfit, riding horses and popping that booty. Jesus very unimpressed here buddies.
😂😂😂
Did she write this song because you could tell because this sucks lol
Being a black countryside woman she's the shit .im loving it❤❤❤
What a disgrace to country music.
This isn’t a country song… it’s pop with an acoustic guitar and whistling.
No thanks
This supposed garbage they've been calling county is a joke! Bring back old school  and bring back ethics! The last real black county singer was Charlie pride! Keep rap with rap r&b where they belong! Nothing wrong with them but this trash 🗑 is exactly that  🗑 !
The vid is kind of bland.
Racist
Makes absolutely no sense. Just because you've got country twang sound and a couple country words, it makes it country? It's not country. It's pop. It's crap. 😂
That song is awful 😖
Really
This is not country! I don’t even get what’s so good about Beyoncé
This is horrible!!!
For all you sad souls who think this is a country song…Well Bless Your Hearts.
GIRL you could NEVER be COUNTRY! 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Is the whole music video just repeating I kinda wish she would have put on a western outfit
My female friend said this isn’t country, it’s boring …… that was her kindest comment…… the rest of her comments were even funnier….
Gawd, she's disgusting. If she wants to do something "country" perhaps she should act like a lady.
Definitely not country!! Sick with Pop, hip hop, or whatever you call your genre. You ain't country!
*mehh. gimme dixie delight. now thats a country song.*
mehh. gimme dixie delight. now thats a country song.
What a ridiculous video. Real talent does have to expose their breast.  Cookie cutter pop.  No talent here.
Beyonce tried it, but stay in your lane B cause this ain't country and no amount of lingerie and skin you show will seduce us into thinking that it is. Also, Country folk drive Chevys and Rams, not a Lexus. Goodbye 😂
I think people are getting COUNTRY and POP COUNTRY mixed up. This is NOT country music. Not saying it’s not a catchy song, cause it is. It’s just not country music. People are reaching. Darius Rucker…..country music.  Kane Brown…..country music. Beyoncé…..Pop/Hip Hop
What absolute garbage of a song.
Absolutely dog shit
If Dolly is supporting this, she’s gone rogue!!
Puke!!!🤮🤮🤮
I would rather watch cellulite bounce off a Camels ass!
Trash
Pure Junk! I guess because she was half naked.
I guess its not the worst song ever. I listen to all genres and wouldn't really say its country so much as pop country like Achy Breaky Heart. People will listen to it bc its her, or maybe they like it. You do what keeps you maintaining your empire, girl.
Wow, that was terrible 😳
Trash
Great song shame she couldn't find her shirt 😂😅😊
And she should win “Album of the Year”?!?! For This?!?! Let me know when she gets to Aretha Franklin Level!! And please put some Clothes On!! This is not a Strip Club!! I guess they think by Dressing almost Naked her Albums will Sell?!?! Not really impressed by this Song…..it sounds more Gospel Church to me?!?! I like her 1990s songs better than this….but she ain’t No Aretha Franklin!!
She sold herself to the devil.  :(
Move over Dolly, Reba, Carrie, Lainey and all the women of country that came before Beyonce....next years Top Country Grammy Award Winner definitley!
I like the song but I think the video could have been better. Please don’t come for me I just know she does better videos and have been listening to her since Destiny’s Child.
Yay🎉 She grew up not far from where I live, she's a shining star from TEXAS.  And Blessed with so much TALENT!  And a rare beauty❤ My old self absolutely LOVES  this!  Y'all ought to see my big black lab dance to this song with me, she loves it, too!❤🎉
The only thing country about this song is the guitar and the word Texas.
Her voice
definitely not a country song lol
What is this shit?
She doing the Baphomet pose.. Satanic illuminati Queen BEE
Country music was created by black people.. Guess who stole  that? Glad the black community is bringing country music back!
pherot 🇧🇩
Ugly costume
Go girl we love it.❤️ Sorry the jealousy and the haters are intimidate .
I like it but what's up with this video????
I like the song but they could have done a better video.
Współczuję jej dziecią  . Dlaczego tak w negliżu 😮
Beyonce is Texas No surprise 🤷🏽‍♀️ Excellent Bey!
Trash
Listening from Italy 🇮🇹
This song is complete fucking dogshit
Haaaaaahahahahaha!!!!!!!
She killed it. Black singing artists have taken control over country music. We can master anything. Now I am waiting on the haters comments. No guarantees I will reply back though. Lol. 👍🖐️😁
This is not country .. Girl go back to your lane.
This is pop music. You think because you talk about a couple country things in your song it makes it country? This is trash
Too racy, where's decency?
Little class… not my fav … stop sexualizing women
🤮
luv it 🥰
What is the point in this video.
Stick to some thing you know and put some clothes on. This video is stupid
Lady gaga already did a texas holdem song.  No originality here and this song and video sucks.
I tell people that I don’t like country music, but really I don’t like new country music. I love me some Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, and Beyoncé seems to be channeling the old school greats. Hope she brings this genre back to greatness it had!
That is terrible
Gross
County music will never be ruled by Beyoncé, she is not country just a copy cat
Why do women keep getting implants lol.  Trust me ladies, most men can tell if they are fake.  It's better to have small natural boobs than to have big artificial silicone boobs.
She is not the Queen of Country…..that title belongs to Miss Loretta Lynn
Black people have been doing country music for decades. Charley Pride, Donna Summer, The Pointer Sisters, Darius Rucker, Aaron Neville. and so many more. People dont care about Black people doing country. People care about Beyonce doing it. That goes for supporters and detractors. Let's give more attention to Tracy Chapman.
I realize that some people say this doesn’t qualify as country. Hmm… I’m starting to wonder if it’s because she doesn’t fit the right hue in their eyes. When Taylor Swift did the same thing, it was country 😂
It’s aight
That’s definitely NOT how Waylon did it.
This is wanna be country, she dont even sound country. Stay in your lane. 😂 this song sucks
No matter what she sings everything sounds the same she can’t get beyond the sound of I’m a survivor… her music has always sucked, Jay-z pays for her spotlight.
This doesn’t sound like country just because you’re talking about Texas hold them doesn’t make a fucking country
This ain't country. This is pop. Just because you sing with a twang and have acoustic steel guitars playing and shit, it doesn't make it country.
Hot dog water.
People sayin this is country music…..lmao!!!!
Finally a Beyonce song I can listen to.
Why don't people wear clothes anymore.....
I hate the sound of her voice. She can’t sing. This is awful.
Whats the fuck is this garbage💀
Lmao everyone saying black music bringing back to roots ur hilarious everything gotta be about it race
This is the Franklin theme song
I’m not a country song lover but Queen B brought me here 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽🥰❤❤❤
Did she go country because Taylor took all the Grammy's? Just asking for a friend😂😂😂😂
I think the left for refusing to play her music on country stations or being so up in arms over he doing a country song are some cry babies. I am not a fan of today's country music. I grew up in the 70s and 80s when George Jones. Charlie Pride, Conway Twitty, Barbara Mandrell, Dolly Parton,  Linda Ronstadt and whole mess of other were singing good country music. I enjoyed this song, it's not fluffy it's a natural sound of country that doesn't have to have a pick up truck driving next to a train with a dog in the passenger seat. I can't believe they won't play her song because she has been an R&B artist or labelled in the pop industry. I mean shit...Darius Rucker of Hootie & the Blowfish was able to transition to country and be successful why can't she? Hell, she was born in Houston Texas. She can't get much more country than that. I know Houston is a more progressive city than a lot of other Texas cities but that's still in the south land. People need to grow up and lighten up and enjoy what this is, a great song.
This isn't country I'm not trying to hate but me and my family were raids on country and just no
Love this song
Franklin the turtle theme song.
This ain't no fucking country! U don't have a country voice at all!
Franklins children’s show song
Lol
Sucks
Why have to be half naked to sell your music ?  Your talented voice is enough.  Jeez
Beyonce be singing sum Kute song
It's her hottest since that BP rendition at that Superbowl, Bhh,  parental advisement is warranted: Recommended.
It's a catchy song. It is country style; but def. not country music. Country music died in the 90's when the genre was taken over by pop singers, singing pop songs, while wearing cowboy hats and jeans, and singing the lyrics with country accents.
I thought this was the Theme song to Frankly at first.
Amazing Song!!! 🤠
This song wouldn't go anywhere without the video!Tits and ass still go a long way!❤
Nah idk man theses comments must be paid for bc this ain't it
Such a great catchy song 🎉
I LOVE  This Queen Bee  DONE it again!❤
Cw is black in origin, however where are her clothes?
Couldn’t win album of the year so she went country 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Is this the whole video?
Sounds like the new crappie country to me.
Sucks, she’s not county and doesn’t represent country at all!!! Stay in your lane Beyoncé, this isn’t it!!!!
This makes me want to listen to country song but the country community will surely never give this a chance.
I think she's jealous of her daughter so she has to find something new to do to keep up 2:46
As someone who has listened to country music these past 31 years this not country music. Much more pop. Sorry but not sorry.
Need to stick to RnB 😂
Don’t like it.
This isn't a country song 😂😂😂
Lame. 100% disrespectful to the women in Country Music.
Don't forget, she's a Texas gal and an artist, a performer, an entertainer.....Darius Rucker left his previous band and branched off on his own country career. 😊
Putting on a Cowboy Hat don't make you or a song Country, put on some clothes instead and leave Country music to those with brains
Not the voice for country.
Sounds more gospel than country
Why tf is she naked tho?
I like the song but I don’t like the video. Why she needs to be almost undressed? So common, I’m tired of decadence. It would had been lovely to see her dressed in a cowboy outfit doing an old fashion video. The repetition thing is weird. Not watching it anymore.
This could be a top 20 worst song of all time
And this what they are mad at? Beyonce you go girl
This is NOT true “Country” go back to Pop 🤮 heck, half of the music on “Country” radio, isn’t true country anymore 😢
Put some clothes on
Good song. I guess the folks on the right are mad cuz she does it better than they do!!
Franklin the turtle 🐢!!! Iykyk ..😂
Kinda boring
There goes the one eye symbol... smh...
If you're gonna come to country just stress appropriate please.
Sounds like one  set of lyrics on a loop, with an annoying voice... like trying to listen to Janis Joplin try to sing...and she looks kinda skanky in the video...
What the hell!!!!???? Like seriously!? Please NO!!! AND WHAT IS THIS "VIDEO"????
Love the song, but stupidest video.  And like we all couldn't look like that with all the plastic surgery.  Video has no point
I’m sorry but this is not country
This. Is. Pathetic.
This is horrible...
Hip hop ho stay in your lane. Stop trying to sexualize wholesome country music🤮
Texas baby ♥️😎
That’s not country! What a joke when the words are what you think makes it country. The video isn’t even country everyone shoots guns these days.
It ain't country, it ain't music, it's just noise noise noise noise noise.   There I fixed the lyrics.
Women from the south do not show their every thou and then straight facts they have more respect for their self
It a trash. Don't do country stay in your own line. This line is for you. STOP!
Life long country listener. This ain’t country just because she wears a cowboy hat and talks about hoedown and tornadoes. This is still very POP. “Dont be a bitch, come take it to the flo now”…😂 And to be fair, I don’t consider a lot of Morgan Wallens songs country, Florida Georgia Line, Koe Wetzel…. You want country.. go listen to Turnpike Troubadours or Josh Meloy. That’s country.
Can someone explain the video and outfit ? Why the outfit (did we really need to see half of the boobs ? Doesn’t line up with the feel of music) and repetition of shooting and blowing out the gun? The creativeness is dull and uninspiring .
She stole the beat and tempo from the cartoons FRANKLIN and the tortoise
Fuckin' meh
TRASHY...TAWDRY.  We have seen it all..put it away...let the music speak for itself...the one eye wonder...illuminati BS.
🙏💜
You're stealing our culture 😢
She's so played out smh
I like the song better when it was Franklin the turtle
Music video is creepy her voice at the end is creepy this woman freaks me out and i cant figure out why
Song is good, but that video needs a lot of work
She’s from Houston,Texas…country is in her.
I like the song, but don’t understand why she had to be half naked in the “video” if you can call this loop a video. The song is still cool.
Why is she half naked?
This sounds like old country, and I love it!
Song ain’t that good. But dayum
THIS IS GOING TO GET HER ALBUM OF THE YEAR  GRAMMY SHE SO LONGED HAS DESERVED♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I dig it. I never thought her voice was really pop or rap honestly. She's pulled off some good songs but he really sounds best r&b slow type, soul, church etc she always sounds nice but only in those time is it that she sounds her BEST and AMAZING. hitting every cord naturally and flawlessly. This was nice 🙂
That's not country...more like hickhop
Wearing the stupid patch on her left eye
Maybe country music is good now
She SUPER proud of that boob job and body stocking on top of her turbo powered pantyhose. 😂 She does this every time she gets work done. 😆
Essa mulher é simplesmente perfeita, ela sempre se supera. Ela nasceu para essa era country!❤
Oh hell no!!!!
This ain’t country music. That a Disney song 🤣
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HELL NAW
Beyonce once again stealing the white mans culture and trying to ride a wave. Every genre she seitches to she has to steal. No originality. Nicki Minaj is the queen when it comes to female artists. Shit Beyonce isnt even better than Azealia Banks.
Pretty good song...The video must have cost 9 dollars
Queen Bee do your thing!! I can't wait for her Polka Album in the near future with HOV
here because of txt
i like counrty on her, part of her passion  evidently. I like this better than alot of her other songs. Great song, and the hat looks fabulous!
This is not country music at all it sounds more like pop let’s be real 😂😂
Why does there always have to be nudity in music videos?
This ain’t country. Maybe post Billy   Ray Cyrus country. 😂
Vulgar visuals
This really isnt good. Its like chris brown doing that edm stuff or the afro beats stuff. Like yes u can do it but its not hitting for real.
This is hot garbage
GROSS AND EMBARRASSING Bey!💀
Cool song.. but what makes it county is my question?
Well done reaching 1 in uk charts Beyoncé, I really like this song
Nope and this video creation must have caused some brain strain.
SUCKS....JUST SHIT
This is Godawful, is she joking?
Pure trash at it's finest.
Because a snake over your eye, bee hive hair style and boobs out is so country 😂
Beyoncé u almost flashed us😨
Her nipples are doing their job 🙄 😂. That’s all I have to say. The song isn’t amazing 🤷🏻‍♀️
She is more than Human period .
Nothing about this song is country.
I guess anything is country now. Ben S rap was better than this.
Not liking it to much and too provocative
Lol i guess.
Would be more impressed if the production wasn't a slightly less good version of Brooke Fraser's Something In The Water from 12 years ago. When will pop music make some original music. I miss Destiny's Child.
LOL
She is NOT COUNTRY!! A lot of REAL country music fans think she needs to go back to what she was doing and stay out of country. A lot wonder is she that jealous of Taylor Swift??? Beyonce,  stay in pop music. Leave country alone!!! You can't  put a cowboy hat and boots on and call it country. You gotta live  it everyday!! I don't care what anyone thinks of this post!!!
i hate it ... i love beyonce ... i hate this song
😅😆😅😆
I love this 👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well, this is disturbing 😳 song and the visual. 🤦‍♀️
Can’t hear the song through all that boob.
Everyone needs to do the hard part and wear clothes what’s the point of clothes if you are going to be half dressed just be naked at this point
Music today is terrible
I kept watching the video still
Sounds like a Gretchen Wilson or Shawna Twain song. Beyonce what are you doing?
Wow...this is the best country song I have ever heard.
Yeah this is definitely not country music. This is pop music all over. Saying she’s gone country is a far cry from what it actually is.
SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE PUT HER MIND 2 I AM PROUD OF BEYOUNCE SHE IS WELL ROUNDED GET DOWN SIS U SLAYED THIS SONG. BLACK PEOPLE CREATED COUNTRY MUSIC 1ST N THEY STOLE IT😢😂❤😅🎉
This is not country. It’s trash.
Atleast your good to look at.
This may be the albulm of the year Grammy Jay-Z wants to add to her accolades. Sampling the Franklin theme song music made have done the trick. It's not traditional country, but who cares,  it Beyonce she does what she wants and makes billions doing it.
Lmao couldnt listen more than 30 seconds. Not country as far as I'm concern.
Rhymes with parbage
Yessss
Who else loves this song and thinks it's still country?
To be honest this song isn't good
This is bad music, definitely not country music. No thank you.
...(self-inflicted) wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen.
Why people got to say that she’s claiming black music back??? Firstly music has no colour secondly music is for everyone thirdly no one owns a music genre and please do your history homework as to where music genres originated from…
Beyonce can do any genre....any place...any time.  Well done B.
This is ass
I'd say cultural appropriation but Its just not country at all..
This sounds exactly like Franklin theme song
Too much strip tease for country.
If this is what it takes for our people to regain our platform in any genre of music,we have to pray that some country artist come through with class. What does this song and video actually say about what we have to contribute to country music? This is sad.
this chick has a snake on her left eye exactly the same one from the baphoment. This girl is wicked evil man.
This is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. I thought her lemonade album couldn't any worse. I mean she literally made Alan Jackson and get up and walk out of the Opry now she wants to try to do country hip hop what's next? Is she going to get into a rap battle with Ryan Upchurch?
This sucks
This is stupid.
A mulher é maravilhosa ❤
I love Beyoncé, but this was probably the worst video I’ve ever seen cheap as hell has nothing to do with nothing dance dammit lol
Estragando o country. O country não é um ritmo para exibição do corpo, volta pro pop que é o seu lugar.
This is the song everyone is talking about??   Don’t listen to country(which this isn’t) it’s pop. Of course that’s what country has become.   I’m going back to my Metal playlist
The republicans are mad in comments   Continue haha your streams counts to she get another week at #1
Trash
This sucks!
So this is what classifies as a video now? 😂
Nothing country about this song
Way to bring your trashiness to country music. Put ur clothes back on. Kids are looking up to you. Although I'm not sure why
This song sucks
No thanks
I legit from the country my family has no idea who she is😅😅😅😅😅😅
Average country pop,  She performs a crap song well.  The committee that wrote this crap, needs to revisit Independence Day by Martina McBride.  Real country tells a story, this doesn't.  Not a big fan of the genre as whole and songs like this is why.  Its started going with same cookie cutter heart and fire lyrics of generic pop.  Beyonce is smart going this route though, for some screwed up reason country has been the big gainer on Billboard in the last few yesrs while rap and hip hop has lost half its representation, pop is stagnant and the rest have only gained slightly.  Not sure about a rock album, rock tears up the female vocal chords, except for the pop variety like the Bangles. Tarja Turenen went back opera, Amy Lee considered arguably the best is nowhere near what she was.  Floor probably the best active now, is starting sing very differently on her solo stuff.  Not sure she wants to go there, rock is a young girl game and she is not young.  Rock also requires a much different interaction between vocals and instruments, she would have to give up spotlight to be respected, Japan is really redefining rock. especially the guitar work.  Band Maid, Nemophilia and Love Bites all drive instrumentation over vocals despite the fact they all have excellent lead singers.  A Mexican band thrives on harmony multiple lead singers sometimes inside the same so ng.  Plush has probably the best pure rock to pop singer out there, their lyrics are not great and its I have heard it all before instrumentation, so she is completely shackled in that market.
You’re all a bit dumber for enduring this monotony.
What happened to Cultural appropriation? liberals really trying to ruin every single facet of civilization lmao
I've spent most of my 70 years around Houston,including her old neighborhood. As a kid I was a West Texas shitkicker. I love this & for those offended by her language? We call that just a lil bit of Texas emphasis. Thank ya girl this ole white Texas woman loves it! 🤠oh & Houston rodeo starting right now too! Perfect timing.
I like the song, but I was expecting more in this video.
This song is terrible 😮
I’m here for the comments at this point 😂
That's not how you shoot. 😅
Wow, that was the first time hearing this, I know I'm two or three weeks late. However this song is just good. It's just good music.
this lady never seen a basement let alone a tornado
Why is she doing f the same thing over and over in this video? And that jacket is very, ummmmm, ridiculous? This isn’t country. Sounds slightly gospel to me
her beaver must be delicious.
thanks for showing us your implants
Total crap
Queen
This song is masterpiece 🤠🤠🤠😍😍😍😍😍 I’m obsessed
Why can’t we have country music like it used to be , that is not how we dress , Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette are rolling over in there graves .. she is fine in pop !! Why country?? Go back to where you belong !!!
Not close to being country, shame on the country music charts for putting her there! It’s crap music and a disgusting video
Nice intro cover of the kid's TV show called _Franklin_ from over 20 years ago. 👉😉👉
I was waiting for the change up but I ain't mad at it
More country than country in 2024.
People who hate it because she not country
I don’t even like country music and I was nervous about this new era but I’m hopping to this. I love you B
For all the morons who think this is Country music - it's not even close.  First, it's not Country. Not even in the same league.  Second - "Country Pop" - if that's where you want to put it - is trash.
....there's 4 minutes of my  life I will not be getting back.
Dogshit 💩
When is someone going to call her out for re-using old beats that isn't hers?
This isn’t country at all it’s stupid
❤
It’s different because it’s not country music
Filthy, nothing like country music.😤😒😔
Now this is how country music is supposed to sound... whooo hoo!!
Country music get ready for more fans they are on the way. Great song
There's no soul in this music. It's flat
😂😂😂😂
Heeeey, it's Franklin
I live in SC. With that said ? Wheirs the difference between Beyonces song and almost ALL of the country artist today .  None of em are country , hardly any of em write there own music and they all talkn about dirt roads and moonshine.  She's as country as most country artist today ..
Im not a Beyonce fan at all but I came to support my Sistah....Oh K Michelle went country too. She been fighting racism doing contry as well. Y'all check her out too
Don't hate it , respect it . But what yall missin is country aint words it's actions. The way ya carry yaself , I just don't believe it is all.
vou comprar meu chapéu de cowboy mami
I don’t get this song, the words make no sense, they’re all over the place
delete it
This screams midlife crisis 🤣
Doesn‘t sound like country music at all
Not impressed!!!!
This ain't Texas, nor is it country music. It's lazy writing and repetitive shit and it's number one on billboard, and it should be at the bottom, I mean, look at the lazy ass video that says all you need to know.
Me encanta!
Nice song done well, but I wish she had worn more clothes.
I didn't think I could like Country music less...
Terrible song.
I don't really care what negative comes....I LIKE IT!
Lol why is this considered country? Because there is a guitar?
How about this. She should get dressed go to church and sing to Jesus. Not this stupid world we live in today.....
🙄🤦🏽‍♀️🥱
THIS IS CULTURAL APPROPIATION!!!
Love love this song & I am from Texas ❤❤❤❤
Hello, would you like to have a POPsaic style portrait? I am a visual artist from Cuba :)
I will never know why women have to sell sexy, and men don't. This is not country, it is just someone showing off their boobs with a twang. Not a fav and this artist could have done so so much better!
Lmfao at people saying this isn’t country. With the abundance of pop country and indie country. I wonder why this is being singled out lol. Just say ya don’t like This woman and leave it at that
this is not country music
worst song i've ever heard. more dogshit
this makes me want to puke
Why is she half naked, this is trash.
Not angry, Charlie Pride would agree with me. She's a disgrace to country music.
Never been a fan of her & I’m still not! This isn’t country music.
Terrible video, not the best song either. The boobs are the only thing keeping anyone watching.
Born and raised in Tennessee for 62 years. This is NOT Country Music! It does have a twang to it but it’s not Country! Definitely not Country attire! I bet Loretta Lynn and Minnie Pearl are turning in their grave! Not for me! 😊🤠🎵🎶
The lyrics, and song seem very contrived.  Also, she forgot her shirt 🤷🏻‍♀️
disgrace for all categories, if existing really or not, Her only qualification would maybe b that She had maybe to stare or look twice as l*ng to get the same permanent macula damage standard pop song with a good sun protection and cheaply produced like assembly line according to eye pigMentAtion so-called blin* blink (the problem is that video edit can obfuscate dancing skills etc. so You had to look closely, so She ruined Her childhood for this and motivated others to do this as well?!)?!
Can something happen other than the same thing over and over and over and over and over? Was she short on funds? Lol
It’s as much Country as Luke Bryan…it’s not, it’s pop
No thank you . And being semi naked doesn’t help,
The most shit song she could’ve done 🤣🤣🤣 not even country and any ACTUAL country folk know this.
A guitar and a choir singing backup doesn’t make it country.
Taylor Swift rules, she doesn't have to take who she is. This individual can't even call the hogs. Plus she's a bad role model for younger girls. Would you want your daughter coming out on stage naked....
She has such a gospel voice
That sucks 😂
It's  not the song, it's something  ok , its the trashy outfit that's not right, probably if she dressed  differently people wouldn't criticize her so much. She's  a beautiful talented lady she does not have to show so much skin to draw some  attention ☹️
This flat out was awful Country Music. I wanted to like it, listened, skipped around on the song looking for something that sutting thru it might have as a cookie crumb of good. How did this become a # 1 on the charts ? So I went looking for the B-side 16 Carriages and it was even worse than Texas Hold'em. I can't imagine 8 more songs on this album or whatever the track count is being much more than the same forgettable garbage. I'm no country Music expert or afficionado, but there are Country Music songs that even I will listen to. 0-2 is what Beyonce has released in my book. Her voice just isn't Country, the lyrics of this are almost NYC-like. She may be from Houston, TX, but this was god awful Texas Country Music, I doubt any radio station is playing this in the SE USA or even SW USA/Colorado/Midwest Country. I'd rather listen to old John Denver, Shania Twain country. Aaron Lewis of Staind does better Country Music than Beyonce.
Really good song!!!
Love the song! The video is garbage.
****Unbiased and no sheep**** I heard this song on radio the other day.  I didn't know who was singing it until heard a little more of it.  I didn't like it from the beginning and didn't like it even more when I learned that it was supposed to be country.   🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷  I am sure they will have to pay radio stations to make this both country and a hit.  🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦.  I will be a hit and considered country though .  The sheep will eat it up. 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
This isnt country. Its just beyonce lol
Its her Joanne era ❤
Why do they always have to use sex to sell their music?
This video is not repetitive at all at all at all ........................
I can't lie, this song is fire. I really be really listening to a lot of the country song lyrics and they really  are saying some real ish. Thank you Beyonce for this #1💯
Gross
I'll pass and listen to the real country music
:( not country. Maybe a parody of country music.🤥
It don't sound like country
Beyonce you're a embarrassment to country music wearing scandalous clothes that country people don't do and we also don't wear mask like wtf is that.....stick with r&b because you don't sound country anyway.
😅😅😅😅 now she's ripped a cartoon  really " Franklin " 😅😅  music is dead especially  when   people  start remaking tv show theme songs.... was this song caused by the "Tyler Swift effect" 😅
🔥
NOT COUNTRY. ALL YOU WHO TAKE HER SIDE AND SAY THIS IS COUNTRY IS WHATS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD.
Come pour some sugar on me and some honey too…🤠
Can't decide if this is better than I expected or worse
I like it, I don't see how it's not country to be honest. I feel like it has all the country parts to it to be in that genre. Just has her own artistic style to it.
Over rated. Just like everything else she does. This is low hanging fruit. She knew it would be easy to be the first black woman to get number one on the charts. Thats the only reason she did it. Still way inferior to Taylor who writes her own music and is just more creative and sounds better. Its time we stop celebrating blacks just for being black. Im tired of being afraid to say this. Its time all this garbage stopped.
This sucks so bad.
I don’t get it
Trash
She can sing...why not let that define her...sooo fulger i dont hear her...
Le clip le moins cher de l’histoire des clips 😂
So its a country song coz she used the word texas ???? And it aint even a great song to be honest.... Good country stars like Georgia florida line need better recognition for country
What the Frickin  biscuits n gravy is this sh**?  This is not country, let alone her cheap, sleazy video!!  Hollywood has really become desperate to come up with something to " SELL"!  More garbage from the music industry, scraping the bottom of the barrel again.  LOL!!!! Beyonce should just retire.  She wasnt that good before, not its gotten much worse.  Ugh!
TOTALLY SUCKS!!!!@
Nice bit of, one eye covered, Illuminati imagery being repeated over and over…
Being half naked doesn’t make this song any better. Not a fan of
Come on now this song was ok and she's from Texas I think but a country hit please
Put on some clothes. Have some confidence in your actual craft.
Not the country police in the comments
Franklin theme song is going HARD
Yea this song sucks
Video is STUPID.  Song okay.
Boycot this crap Don’t put any more money in Jayzees pockets
"hey it's Franklin"
Dont like it.
She stolen Franklins theme song
This isn't country!
This is a very lame attempt at getting artist of the year or whatever award she hasn't gotten yet and this definitely is no country song and Beyoncé is definitely no Taylor Swift
What a boring  video . And has nothing to do with western musicians the subject matter of the song. The song is awesome the video NOT.
I get the idea of this song, but this will never be considered a “country” song to me. Y’all should check out, Life ain’t fair and the world is mean by: Sturgill Simpson. RESPECTIVELY, this is what I think.
Wtf is she wearing.  Doesn't sound good
Beautiful Blackified Queen surely can sing🎤
Definitely the most boring music video ever. And the worst country song 😂😂😂
The whities are mad just like the blacks were mad when Eminem took over rap 😂
This is the kind of country music i like❤❤❤❤
TRASH
Garbage
This is still PoP. This is not country whatsoever 😂
I just know this woman is an absolute genius cause she got me to listen to country
the style of the first pioneers of country music, this is very fresh, nice delivery ,without being too rock too pop ,like others self call "country singers"
oh this is good
What a load of sh1t
One of my bey favorite song❤❤
Muddy waters is rolling in his grave right now.
THIS SHIT AINT COUNTRY. The thing about country is its supoose to be relatable to the average everyday working man just trying to make it. The song had no substance, no story, just a loop of a loop, almost exactly like a pop song or top 40's hit. Not one word about fishing, trucks, a dog, a white fence, a childhood home, country roots, farming, fields, a husband and wife, nothing. If you think this is country you have no clue as to what country music is.
This is horrible and you should feel horrible.
Yall need to stop. This is not country music.
That is the weirdest video I've ever seen just repeats the same clip over and
I love this Beyoncé countryside. Many artists are choosing to try different genres, which I find very experimental and turn on great. Dolly Parton came out with a rock album and it’s actually fantastic.
I’m a huge country music fan she singa a great song but why do you have to be naked and walk back-and-forth and do the same thing? There is absolutely nothing to this video absolutely nothing but a repeat of her nudity sexuality why can’t people just sing their song and just be decent so other people can enjoy it instead of everything being a disgusting striptease women sexualize them selves for money. This woman is so big on women’s rights but she degrades women with the way she dresses I just don’t understand it it’s hypocritical. It makes no sense.
This aint country music.
Omg
Shes got nothing on jelly roll or lainey wilson now thats real country
Eh It s Franklin 🤫🤫
Absolute load of hot garbage but then again country music has been long dead I don't know what the fuck this is. And I listen to music in 14 different languages. At least she doesn't sound like she's being tased in the taint like most of the crap she produces
I like the song but I don't like the nudity!
This ain’t Country at all and obviously nothing was thawed into the theatrics portion of it because it’s the same clip over and over again and she’s trying to sell it by showing half of her titties. Disgusting.
Song is wack !!
If I was the creator of the cartoon Franklin, I might be thinking about some compensation lmmfao
Stupid video
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Hey, it’s Franklin Coming over to play Growing a little Everyday🤘🤘
franklin the turtle
And still didn't get yet album of the year. That's says something to me lol
Grammys Best album of the year.
This is far from country
If this is country, then the shit that falls outta my ass is rap 😂
She should stick to her POP music. ..and she should get dressed.
No thanks
Free palestine.
Lol ho down with her boobs out the whole time wearing  drawers and a vest😂😂😂 no thanks b this ain't country with all that cussing. Post did it well she tried it smh
Get dressed😢
What about the Gospel genre? OOPS. Nevermind. We KNOW she ain't going there😂
Stay in your lane....ps put clothes on .cultural appropriation ain't cool..
This is awful.
This is trash.     She can't win  anything.      Worst.  Country song to date.  She needs to keep her. Self outa country.  Horrible.  Song
Why is she dressed like a lady of the night? Real country singers don't have to strip nearly naked to sing and sell their songs. Most have good values and morals and are cautious about exposing children to explicit nudity. Was there enough confidence in her that her song was good on it's own, or did it need near nudity to get people's attention?  🤔
Cadê os Brasileiros que amou ❤
Amazing Beyoncé 🥰
Never expected a song to start an internet race war between the worst kind of racists on both sides but here we are.... The human race never ceases to disappoint. I LOVE the song by the way. It's just a shame that idiots on the Internet have to drag everything into the gutter.
I only came here to see if this song is as terrible as everybody on Instagram says… it’s worse. 😂
Man if she make a rock and roll album I'm gone die of excitement 👀🤠
The song is catchy but this has to be the most lame video ever made. Esp for B. With everyone  doing that dance to this song I figured she would be doing that dance In the video
OMG Thus us terrible.  Unfortunately ill never get ti see the actual video cause i wont be listening to the sing again.  I laughed from the time i heard the word lexus.  I mean good for her but bad tor real country music listeners
……Yahoo….🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾🕺💃🏾
Am I the only one who here PBS Kids in this beat
Doesnt sound like country at all. Why wear anything at all? Promoting porn to our young Men and Women🤮🤮🤮
Absolutely terrible music
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Were the boobs necessary???
Where’s the dance that’s gone viral? Does beyonce not do the dance? Everyone made that dance up to her song????
I'm sorry...I hate the video...this is by far, one of the worst videos to a song ever. What's interesting watching a beautiful woman dressed and walking sexy? How this become a video? I see that everyday! OMG I hate the video soooo much! She looked good anyway
Definitely not country
U both have no vids
Lol this isn't country.  This is her trying to sing country while singing witha pop voice.  She's on repeat.  This is the worse music video.  Hey guys I am going to be half naked and pretend to shoot a gun haha.
Music video 👎👎👎
Music is great! She doesn't need the costumes and body exposure. Her voice is so so awesome ❤
I’m not really getting country vibe from this …maybe you should stick to pop/rock/soul vibe…but she’s a beautiful lady..showing a little too much skin however…Beyoncé’ you have IT you ain’t got to use your body to sell records so don’t sell yourself short!
“Earned all this money but they’ll never take the COUNTRY off me”
Country music was music of black people
Wears her Cowboy hat? There's some good, wholesome Country music! Yee Hah!!! 3 cuss words in it. Great writing, there! Prolly win a Grammy for this. Stick to R&B pop,Beyonce!!! Kinda like Dolly doing a rap song!😅
Never liked her music but this is fantastic ❤
Umm…
Worst song ever
This is so CAATCHY!!!! That hook got me hooked!!!
Whatever it takes she'll be damned if she cannot dance with album of the year too....#country #beyonce
This song is just plain offensive to country music and country music lovers
🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵🌵
🐄 🐮 🐄 🐮 🐄 🐮 🐄 🐮
🤠 🤠 🤠 🤠 🤠 🤠 🤠 🤠
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not good enuf for country music
Sounds country to me, that's what matter to me❤
Hi Beyonce it's Drimp
Had me tapping my feet. Everyone is welcome to the table ❤Great job Lady "B"
Just got this one mute.. loving it lol
She really just played Texas hold 'em with her tits on this one. Luckily she wasnt deal a bad jacket...
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Love Beyonce but still not a fan of country music
This ain’t country. It’s pop with some sprinkles of “country” instrumentation
Masons know how to shoot music videos
Real country fans think this is not country and also get a real gun! Can't believe I wasted my time
Y'all....like this?
oh heaven help us!
I love this too much haaha
😂😂 what a joke
Worst Beyonce song i've ever heard
🗑️🗑️🚮, not country
Lyrics are mediocre. Decent as an instrumental.
Worst song I've heard in weeks😂
This is trash not country music 🤡🤡🤡
Stupid, absolutely stulid
This ain’t no video it’s a loop and it’s kind of stupid
like the song but why is beyonce basically naked..... this is a insult to her talent
If it didn't have the word Texas in the title, it wouldn't be so popular
Donna Summer, who, when she was the Queen of Disco, made her own history as the first African-American woman to co-write a No. 1 country single in 1980 with “Starting Over Again,” a tune that the late legend wrote with her widower Bruce Sudano for none other than Dolly Parton.
She copy Lady Gaga and Miley Cirys. They are good in country music. She sing pop and think this is "country music". Flop.
This aint country, calling it country doesnt make it country just because theres a lame country hook in there. Fucking sheep will buy anything the elites pump out and lap it up.
is this really the official video? great song.. wtf is this video.. playing that same thing over and over...  was the budget 75$ ?
Hey, It’s Franklin!!!
Dumbest video
Please where are her clothes... hold em cuff em...well turning to country with texas connections...major label decisions... Not a fan of this video outfit ir career move..good luck with this..hope this lady gets everything she deserves ❤
Yes Bey this is what we wanted
Not ppl saying this was a video 😂😂😂 Beyonce play too much this a boomerang reel
V ery clever move . She knows what she is doing 😁
I thought this was a country song this is r&B pop.
Пісня гарна та якось вульгарно...так просто вульгарно
Nah
Is this meant to be so boring? Is that a thing now ?
It’s not good
why the baphomet resemblance ?  the hand signs
Hold up...Where's my cow bitch hat
Just had to get the boobs out
All of a sudden a Beyoncé fan cuz she went country
If Queen B’s songs are so good, then why does she feel like she has to dress scantily in her videos. Be classy like Taylor Swift.
A super talented black woman make everyone mad...At thiz point we should just accept she a GOAT and stop arguing....
She looks so stupid
Good GOD this narcissist is so overrated its suckening watching people fawn all over her pretending they know the first thing about music and she is talented. Pffft. This song is truly HORRIBLE! Like all her stuff.
Yeah, nah !!
I like the song 🤷🏼‍♂️🔥💃🏻🕺🏻… although its sounds more like folk music… reminds me of edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros
On repeat ... repeat ... repeat ... Go get some clothes on girl 😊 Seems like she is mocking with the video repeat or maybe they just had to cut video before she lost all her clothes 😂😂😂
Not sure why peeps are hating on her she is a great singer and she is a babe 🔥 ❤
This isn’t country music 😂
This is not what I would call a music  video.
Can we please put more people on to Reyna Reynolds: Winchester song thanke later Reyna is the next big country ⭐ Beyonce is making way for her even tho she's been out for a while now! But this song is awesome!
This one different
I'll be honest, I wanted to hate this because it seemed a bit TOO pretentious, but I think it's great!
Pathetic. When the first black metal album comes out then I will raise my eyebrows.
THAT AIN'T COUNTRY 😂😂😂 DOLLY PARTON TAMMY WYNETTE LORETTA LYNN COUNTRY SINGERS
Country got it ain’t too bad she didn’t wear something country
Not country at all!!! Sell out!! BS!! Sucks!!  The U.S....is WACKED!!!!
Chapel Heart is country, but this? I'm not sure.
It's just got some country fusion but it's not structurally country and I'm not even fond of country
I take it the song wldnt have been good w more clothes on?
Dope 🤎
😂😂 what a joke
Love it ❤❤❤❤❤ White man music only!!! What about the supreme Charley Pride.Taylor Swift is a cult..not a singer.BEYONCE IS GORGEOUS AND AN AWESOME SINGER.❤❤❤❤❤❤
Vulgar video & lyrics   kids will be watching this & parents will let them because its Beyonce
Trash song 😢😢😢so sad
Beyonce's next move she hits number one with  a Norwegian death metal song
Is this her idea of being rebellious and alternative like the metal hand she had last time? All the goths and metal heads around the world laughed at that
Not country just Beyonce singing with a bit of country backing for a woman so many idolize this as really disappointing
😴😴😴
That was smooth! ❤
Extremely boring repetitive and lack Lustre imo
I don't like country but this is pretty cool.
I personally wouldn’t say it’s country. Mind you, I’m not the biggest fan of country music to begin with and thinking about it, most song country songs I’ve heard the artist had a noticeable twang their voice.   The song is nice though. I wouldn’t skip it if it came up on my Spotify.
Lookin white af 😂🫣😵‍💫💀
Meh,  good try though....
This song sucks
This isn’t country….this is garbage.
🗑️
This song does sound like the Franklin the turtle theme song.
”Country?” 🤔
just wasted 4 mins of my life
what a great song!!!! terrible video but excellent song, she could done so much with this song
LMK WAT YALL THINK GANG I MAKE MUSIC EVERY WEEK ON MA CHANNEL 🔥🔥
Honestly this song could have been left over from the indie folk trend of the early 2010s
This is repulsive she ain’t country this is trash. I’m a black man I can’t stand this!! She’s going to destroy this genre. Anyone tell her a Bentley ain’t a horse. This shows she doesn’t care about anything but fame
Sometimes less is more the sound is great but a full set of country gear might. But what do I know.😅😅
This is not country music
Revival of the southern soul music...video would've been better with a nip slip
Fucking wack ass song.
C nul
She can sing any genre of music and make it sound so good
This not her song don’t sound like her and she not even singing and stuff she stuff she doing all over and and over dont stop is repeating and repeating
It's not bad, but it's as country as Taylor swift was. Which is to say this is pop music
This is a no for me.
Reminding me of miley cyrus Hoe down Throw down..but less upbeat and energetic.   Beyonce energy just not quite there
Trash
I love the songs, but it’s needs better choreography.
🙈😞oh how nasty.whats next  ..ice hockey and conservative presidential aspirations 😂😂... seriously laughing
This is brilliant! Did she walk into the wrong recording studio session and just go with it!? 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love it
All of a sudden a Beyonce Fan this has to be the best song she has ever released no wonder it's #1
Fire fire fire 🔥 ❤
Hey it’s franklin, wait wrong song
Hey, it’s Franklin….
Ughhh QUEEN BBBBBB😆❤️😫😩💗
Terribly boring video.
It's gonna be a NO for me 😢
Wtf this the VIDEO FOR THE SOMG???😅😅😅😅
Lol this is the worse bs child song I have ever heard.. this is #1? Toy story did better..   You will vote for literally anything, how sad.
Why doesn't she have a navel on her stomach, yulk 😢😮
LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even Beyonce can't do everything, and she proved that right here with this. She looks for her age and for being a mom, I'll give her that much at least
Eh can't say I'll listen again but it's not revolting. It's my first time ever hearing her and I don't really like her voice so......  Good on her for trying I guess 🤷‍♀️.
Like song but video she could do good
This will never be country
This ain't country, boss
This ain't country, boss
Hace historia metiéndose en el country blanco!
Gran artista , tremenda mujer, saludos desde  San Juan Argentina!
I only know three songs from her. I know she is big but I don't really follow. All I know that I live in Texas and this song is gonna be on repeat because now out of the sudden everyone is going love country music.
Ok, so I like the song ok. I am just so confused about what she is talking about. I don’t get it. It does not seem to be a cohesive story or lyric. I don’t get it.
It sounded like some Cheesy  Frozen Fish Commercial, Put some Damn Clothes on too, Folks Don't need to see you in your Underpants all the time
Sweet and Sexy 2024❤❤
No hate on Beyoncé but please keep to your genre. This is not country, its a R&B song with "western" words.
Honestly I don’t think she’d know what country was if she tripped over it. This in my opinion definitely is not country music. The icons are turning over in their graves.  This appears to be a slap in the face 😢
Whether you think's it's a country song or not, we should all be able to agree it's a fuckin stupid song
Not even a Beyoncé fan but y’all hating bc she’s able to do more genres than what she normally does. Country now isn’t even real country goofy ahhhs 😭
Horrible. And put some clothes  on.
whack
This ain’t country😢
After all these years I’m finally sold on Beyonce.  Love this song.
This sucks
When you are Not Hot.  Anymore  You got go with the Flow....
Awful song 😂, Beyonce trying hard to look white
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
I'm addicted ❤
Witch
I didn't know something could both suck and blow at the same time
I'd say it's giving RDR2
This still ain't country lol yall sad if you think this or any pop country is country
Maybe skip all the cussing on the next one.  Porn would be a better next…
Are you trying to make country look trashy? Because you're succeeding. Come on! This song could have been good if your video wasn't just you standing around half naked shooting finger guns...so trashy! 🙄 plus as everyone has pointed out, you stole this from Franklin.
Boring..another person trying to play..tell us about it Franklin 🐢
Love the song .Her video makes no sense 😏
A lazy video for a trash look.  Beonce is better than this.
How is that a #1 song? Pretty much sucks
Omg . I love the song .  But why is Bey bringing her "female rap nudity attire" over to country music??? Disappointed ☹️. She could have created a mob line dance . It's a HOE DOWN alright 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Even "Auntie Dolly Parton" approves Queen Bey going Country!!!
First time I have heard this in full and actually seen the words.  Not a great song and the You Tube is even worse.   Huge miss for me...
Wow!!🤦🏻‍♀️
Love it ❤
No thank you, I’ll stick with George Strait and Dolly
CULTURAL APPROPIATION.
this sucks
And she always had to be half naked 😮
Zoom in for a clearer view 😂
Not country
Dumb song.
It is a good song, but this sounds like Southern  gospel.
OMG Beyonće I love your music
Beyonce’s a Beyotch!!!
Alright, so I like the song, I don't like synthesizers so I like this much better than anything else she's done. It's a good, solid song. But no, I don't like the sexuality she puts out. It actually takes away from the song.
She selling sex or country music? What a joke!!!! 😩 😡
Don't like the video, like the song ✨
Don’t Like It
I feel like this is a spoof making fun of country music!! Looks & sounds hideous!! 😮
This is awful 🤮🤮🤮
Where are the rest of her clothes?
Why does she need her tits out to sell music. Great mentoring to girls, not. This is so sad and tragic. Give me Adele, and Jessica Malboy, real talent and realistic role models.
So being pretty much nude puts you on the country top 100. Sad times.
They ain't da boss of you!!!  I ❤ it!!!
How is this even country? And I don't even like country. I mean dude she messed up the Ave Maria and now this? I mean wtf.
Lyric writer "This aint Texas so park your Lexus"  Beyonce "Perfect." 😂🤣😂🤣
Come on yall. This is some nonsense.
😢😮
So un classy  I thought she had more class
naaaaaa!
Public nudity...real role model for your girls. Not.
This is not country at all lol
Mid
she sings better country than that genre artist do.
LINDO ❤
Trash
I love me some Beyonce 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉. Dancing honey......this ain't Texas 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉. We love you Queen B!
Tanner Adell did it first. And better
Yawn
Catchy, and soon to be annoying tune.  Takes more than a song to be country,  still a slut after all these years....
A.I.
If I hear one more person say this is country music I am going to throw up 🤮
Dang, I don't usually like Beyoncé's music, but this is fun. It's begging for a line dance.
Oh god, make her stop 🙄
Weak sauce
Beyonce got the world movin
This fuckin sucks…
She disgust me this is not country music this is trash
She’s evil ! Don’t need her back in Texas one of Gods state!!
Country music ain't country music anymore. It's more soft rock/pop.  This isn't what I would call a country song but do what it do..
Mediocre at best...but popularity makes people believe otherwise.
This would've been amazing if there was a bunch of beautiful girls doing THE line dance meant for this song.
🐝
🤠
I guess she's voting for Trump next
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀
Always surprises us ❤
I like the song, the custom, not so much.
Boring
What the hell is this shit, definitely ain’t Country
I mean, it’s iiiiight. 🎶🤷🏻‍♀️
Yes now that she destroyed black women she will shoot for others. Good luck with this garbage
Country music just slipped into the trash.😢
Beyonce just took a dump on country!
It would be nice if she respected some of her followers and put some clothes on and stop showing the same picture shows her cinematography or people who tell her how to make her videos. I really think it’s sad that people think that just make money good though that’s about it.
Not impressed with the video or the song.
Franklin the turtle themesong
"Hey it's Franklin!"
Not horrible. But I knew she would have to put some hood stuff in there. And what the hell is that stupid thing on her face?!?!
Nice to see the illuminati covered eye🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Horrible this song sucks!
Love the song.like to see another video match the lyrics with fun dancing
What a disgrace to country music
Dolly& I gotcha
I kinda like this, now. I am playing this for the Trumptards on my block.......YeeHaw!!!!!!
The song is good but the visual is awful. Get some clothes and your panty hose are on backwards, the lines are suppose to run up the back of the legs. And those glasses things what the hell.
Trash. This isn’t country 🤣
This sucks, don't buy into the hype
The verse should start with “this ain’t country” what a joke.
This is not it.
This aint country, but the same people will say Ben Shapiro can rap LOL fuckign racism at its finest
Is this a joke?
I'm sorry but this is terrible
Taylor has got to her head. She realizes she can never beat her.
We all know when someone is trying so hard to be relevant. B shouldn't have to, but she is and we all know it.
My Bissh 🍕 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💨💨💨
Wait am i stuck on repeat?
This is her first country song and it's already this nasty.  "It's a real live  Hoe down" alright.  No thanks.  I'm going to stay with listening and watching  the country music and videos about God, our country and family values.
Sorry but this is NOT country music.....
This aint country.
What message are kids supposed to think looking at her dressed like that and throwing swearing in her beautiful songs 🤦🏽‍♀️ I thought she was God fearing.
😂😂😂 at the video and especially the song....
Talented!!!!!! But hoflation/304
I'm totally supportive of beyoncé trying some country music I just don't think this is a very good song. I just don't think she's found her voice in country yet.
Where your clothes at B?
Dumb vid and song. 🤮
Nope for me to trashy
Stick to what you do. Country music ain't yo thang, girl!
Trash
So she had a boob job 👏 and wants ppl to know
Omg stick to your original
This is just bad
This is terrible
That hey, it's Franklin never sounded so good.
Pure filth. Stay out of country.
This is NOT country. Her and Taylor swift need to stay in their lanes, and stick to their crappy pop music.
Beyonce is country girl
Still pop
Beyonce still trying to be relevant... Sorry Boo, this ain't it either.... Maybe you should look into being a stay at home Mom or something.....
Nope.
classless put sone fng clothes on what a snk!!
The moment when young cowboys pellet guns became six shooters.
"HEY, it's Franklin!"
Girl yes, you got pipes. & you're from Texas. This isn't ur genre imo
Hardly country . Reminds me of Adele
Nah... hard pass.
This music video is sure to win a creativity award
Stupid!!!!!
This isn’t country bud
this ain't texas, this ain't country!
Never seen naked girls in country before
Ok Beyoncé! We got you ❤!
Sorry but it doesn't match the hype but you go girl not hatin
Uhh.. why? And who thinks this is good? Really.
"Hey its Franklin" lol
Sorry...its a cheap song with cultural appropriation!💩
I love Beyonce bur this video is garbage
Not a Beyoncé fan but I really like this
laughable
Ps. Songs garbage. Makes me believe sadly the whole chart things bought and paid for fake.
Beautiful Queen B, Beautiful song ❤
Put clothes on weirdo
When you single handedly end racism.  😂
Why she has to do so much cursing?
X🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫x
Rip 🤣🤣🤣 Hey it's Franklin's Theme Song fuckin Ripoff omg too funny 🤣🤣🤣
This is like garbage stereotype racist shit.
This sounds like a simply southern commercial
Soooo..texas doesn't have basements.  No way they went to the basement when the tornado hit the city
Good song. Terrible video
Find Jesus Beyoncé
Get the f away from Country
This ain't texas, aint no holdem 🎶
Trash
Sorry but I don't like it
I love it. Beyoncé sounds great. 🔥 🎶🎶
Sorry that ain't country. Not the way she's dressed, not the music, nuttin country about it. Just tacky. Smh
Lyrics are jibberish.
First of all, go put some clothes on woman!!!
I think she needs attention 😢
Jesus saves ❤
These lyrics are trash
Horrible song and sweet eye covered up, wtf.
Is this fully an AI thing?😂
❤❤❤Beyonce you nailed it awesome song and video ❤❤❤blessings to all humanity 🙏 ✌️
Lame, boring video.  I'm disappointed
They call music videos "visualizers" now?
The Queen of the illuminati
Wasn’t on my 2024 bingo card for sure
Trash
This country girl is confused and offended.
Terrible video, boke 🤮
Someone explain to What is the point of this video please ? 🤔
She said it herself " that shit ain't pretty"
She'l never be country.   Put your damn clothes on. 🤦‍♀️
Why she use the intro to the kids' show Franklin tho hahahah
i love this beautiful country music
Bey, u need  to release DONK.  Such a great song.
Man the effort for music videos has gone wayyyy down…
Bro you stole Franklin the turtles theme song girl!😂😂😂 all us 90 babies know
More country than today's country.
Skank
Beyoncé has a Great tune!!! Sounds 'Boot Scootin'!
❤🇧🇷
Not country music. This is garbage. It doesnt include the necessary ingredients to make real country song. I have to say it does fit in very well with new country which is not country. Thats also garbage.
This is not even close to country.
Show them T&A and they won’t notice you can’t sing
Country female singers don't look like strippers and whores. They have class. This is a hell NO for me.
Love the song but why a naked video?? Click bait or trying to be like Miley Cyrus😅
Parou o mundo, yyyyy rá 👩🏾‍🌾
I love this ❤️
All she did was walk !
Most boring video ever! Wasted a whole damn 3 minutes😂😂
I like the lyrics, love beyonce, but the song and delivery lack vitality. It may have knocked everyones socks off,  but I think its just hype
Ghastly! I dont know which is worse, the video or the song.
What the what!! What is this?!? How did this become number one on the country charts???
Leave it to Beyoncé to highlight the common thread through music…..Very ready for the rock opera wink wink 😊
This ain’t texas …….. aaaaaaint nooo howwwwwdem
sorry but this song is corny
Pretty friggin' good!  More BIPOC singers should go down the country road!!
Somebody tell me how it’s not country. Because Beyoncé is doing it?? I’ve listen to country on the radio I think it fits. It definitely has a nice pop blend though
I know that's right ! not a country -music lover , faithful to herself Queen B , prouve to us that she deserve her golden bloom , this is my opinion .💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐🌷🌺🌷🌺
Your not Country Beyonce
Trash
What the hell is this?.... Terrible, Terrible song. She is just trying to remain relevant in this business.
Horrible song and video she needs to stick to what she knows is normal for her to sing
This isn’t a country song.
Trash
Like the song but the video is dumb.
I adore country music and there are some tunes I can listen to again and again and again; this song is not one of them…love you Beyoncé.
Trash
It sucks, how boring sing and video
Bleh bleh bleh!  *washes ears out with Taylor Swift soap.
Love them Houston women !!!!
people in the comments so bitter lmfaooo this is a country song get over it and feed your kids weirdos
Reina Beyoncé
So again she’s Russian there more of that then anything and her aunt whose Tina sister looks like JayZ was she an egg you used?!?! Regardless you do your chants in a different language that you think folks won’t know. Creole Louisiana through Tina Knowles is nothing we want at all!! So BYE. And the Chinese can relate to your mothers hair due to that mixing of fake Eskimo through that obsessed Russians seeking skin color!!
Put some damn clothes on, ya nasty!
I would’ve liked to see Beyonce have a country song like this…IF she didn’t have to come in half naked and a song that I can’t let my kids listen to for the language. Trash.
This nice 👌.
So stupid!
Song OK video sucks
Put some cloths on
That shit ain't country.
La musique est sympa, mais sinon les habits c'est en option ?? Pourquoi cet accoutrement ??
Hate the song and video  .this is country not a strip club...I have never liked her though..that's just me... And this does not sound like a country song to me at all... She does not have the voice for that.
Charlie Pride is Country.   Dolly Parton is Country.  Dwight Yoakum is Country. THIS is a midlife crisis in the making as @Risque961 correctly labeled it!
Love this so much. I first listen to it when Enews used it for a reel three days ago. This is so cool❤
Mmm… no lol. The first few seconds of the video was not a Country vibe and lyrics are terrible. Nice beat though.
This is country music now? Man every genre is garbage …. Mainstream Hip hop is now trash , R&B died , …… I’m gonna stay in the 90’s Jesus Christ 😂
I feel safe
You just joined  the Real Cowgirl
Sorry this isn't country music 🤮🗑️
Good beat, nice rhythm,  a really nice sound. This isn't country because I don't hate it.
SO LAY YOUR CARDS DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN IS MY  FAVORITE LYRICS ITS CATCHY
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Yay
No, no, no, no  bo burnam was right this shit could be in mandirn it still be pandering
not impressed.
This is pop 😂
This song is demonic qf in case y’all didn’t realize … we all gonna burn in her eyes 😅
Hear  the  roots of the church? They're there.   Should put a smile on all !
shit ain’t no where near country and i’m black😂
Grosssssssss
The point of this video is…there IS no point.
Love love this can't wait for full album ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
It just seems fake. Trying to hard.
Way better than her other music but this video isn't country. It's ghetto.
Audition for a strip club in Texas?
I'm here from the DHHI this is hoe music
🤮🤢🤮
Hey its Franklin!
Pointless 😮😮😮
❤❤❤🎉
Poker face 😂😂😂
This needs to stay right in Texas 😅😅😅
Not Old Town Road which was a hit banger this sucks.
Sucks!!!
Awful 🤮
Go ahead B, let them know !!! 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽#thisisapartofAAculture
Omg as a country fan I love this
Texas Hold them 😂 Carters always know what’s bothering people
You could Navajo!😂😂😂😂😂😂 NEVA!
Not impressed Iya not country it's pop!!
You will never be a country artist. Doesn't even sound  country
What a joke
A stripper image used by Beyonce singing a song that sounds like country music.  Nothing special about this.
Music from the plantation,long journey for the foundation people.
It's giving Madonna vibes but in a hoe way
Straight up trash. Her fans are so loyal she can sing bingo and it will be the number one song 😂😂😂😂
i do like her music but this is not one 😢
She didnt need the cussing in it. Ruined it for me
Tacky
Catchy tune this, i like 😁😁👍
Heyyyy its Franklin
I'm sorry but no country music girls don't dress like that or cuss in there music country music used to tell stories what is this
Not a fan of this video but do love the song. Cheapest music video eva
The song is okay but sounds more gospel to me, in my opinion. I’ve been listening to country music a long time so to me that’s what it sounds like but congratulations to her and her team for making a hit..
what a shit song  culture vulture at work  hypocrisy in full swing.
She must be one of the girls off Wild Wild West with will smith !!!
Now, this song fits the country genre unlike the other one
This is garbage! 😂😂😂
I dont get it
Definitely not country music, seems like a nice pop song.
Dumb AF
Pornographic and vulgar An insult to our country music. A  real talented country  "artist" does not take his/her clothes off!
Really Beyonce' Outfit not for country! Wrong!!!!!
Doesn’t sound country music 🎵. Only for black. Sorry not trying to be mean but that is how I can see , hear it . Black style as usual
You’re definitely not a country singer and your songs garbage it sounds like crap 💩
Trash how is this country? She is nuts like Kanye
Worst song and worst Video ever made.
No music videos for act I and we are on act ii?
She is still very beautiful xoxo is fire
Negative...ain't feeling this..sounds AI... voice ain't stretched to where it needs to hit..can't rock it stoppit...need to work harder
Come for me.  I don’t need to see the boobs.  I’d like my young kid to watch.
The video doesn't show any talent except for the tape hopefully holding the vest on...the lyrics aren't impressive either...what were you thinking Bae? 🤣🤮🤣
Stay in ur own lane. Video awful anyway
Ce clip est fou! Beyoncé ne fait qu'une seule chose mais ça marche!  Véritable génie 😊😊
A black woman singing country music. That is cultural appropriation of the worst kind.
That girl needs to put some clothes on. This skanky stuff is getting old
Wtf did I just watch? 😂😶
❤❤❤ My Dosura and the Wonderful Sereja today I'm very hungry and I need to eat well because I'm feeling really weak and I'm no longer feeling like I'm antis love, don't judge me for being so direct with you and if you want You can also come even if you don't want to come, Love
Wow could of been a better video really serious not country
I didn't Listen to country but this is amazing ❤
Are you kidding me. Stupidest song I've ever heard and the visuals 😂. What a joke.
This Sucks !! Seroiusly wtf kind video is this ??
Who doesn’t love this song
This must be what Alzheimer's feels like
She can do everything she wants
😂
There should have been people  dancing in the video instead of Beyonce just standing there half Naked. I think she is pretty enough to sell music without being half Nude. She does have a very good voice.
Always with the 👁 to show their allegiance
In Europe we don’t like country music at all. It’s not popular .. it’s boring tbh but when it’s done by Beyonce  it sounds great ❤I love it 💁🏻‍♀️❤🎉
This song sucks.
Legit the theme song to the cartoon Franklin 😂😅

This is Garbage. You don't get to be a country artist simply because you are famous in another genre, others who have done this were able to do it because they were actual musicians (played instruments) and grew up on country music. But whatever, country has been dead for a while and it's not coming back. No more class in this world.
This song sucks and doesn't sound Country at all how did it become number 1 on the country charts?
I love the harmonies! I give Beyonce a A on this because its new and its enjoyable and tells a story without a bump or grind in sight so far...anyway...its nice to see her grow this way vocally especially because I can understand the words...and the lack 9f movement tells the story! It reminds me of the way Michael Jackson did his stories ..okay. done..
Sorry folks, THIS AINT COUNTRY.  i' would tell you what it is but they'd suspend me.
Obvi that crap ain't texas. Did she watch like one cowboys and Indians type movie before writing these lyrics/notes??
I was so hoping she'd change outta that dreadfull outfit.   Looks like Kanye dressed her.
I don't care if country music radio stations don't play this...I'll find it and it is straight 🔥 country music is in TROUBLE
Oh wow she slings some country words and now she’s a country singer. Ain’t nothing about this country ! This sucks
Lol fkn terrible joke
Fell asleep during the video. Missed opportunity for a great one. Catchy song.
I wish the the video was more creative...😢
We all know she can really sing  so why does she put this trash out.... i don't know what it is but it's not country
I don't like it and what's up with her not doing anymore music videos? And what makes this country? Because she said so? Sounds like pop to me.
vão ter q aceitar muito a mame no sertanejo
U call this country ? 🤬😭
Pop country not bad suprise from her!!
TF is this? Hoe country?
needs more line dancing, less fashion show...
I think I'm gonna barf.
What's the big deal over this song LOL all I see is a woman half naked on stage shooting a fake gun singing the same lyrics
Lol, when Barbarella goes black and Robotic 😂
Very bad
Gaga did it first and better
No
My God this song is awful. Like I can't get over how bad it is. She should really stay in her lane. This is trash
Dumbest video I've ever seen from her.
The shooting is distasteful,  no thanks
I got so confused i was like why is the same clip repeating 😂😂   ( also me watches the whole thing to see if  anything changes😂)
Not country  Just trash
Pure trash as usual
🚨🚨🚨  Beyoncé conquista seu primeiro #1 no Spotify Global com "TEXAS HOLD 'EM" com 6,622,185 milhões de streams!❤
Um, pretty sure this is 100% NOT country, not even close. So, get to steppin' and nice try. No fiddle, no steel guitar or pedal steel. You had your day in "hip hop" and just because you can't cut it anymore in your genre, doesn't mean you can attempt to come over and try to pollute country music. 🤮🤮
🚨 ELA DISPAROU!   Beyoncé chega a marca de 60 MILHÕES de ouvintes mensais no Spotify pela primeira vez em sua carreira. ✨
De acordo com a primeira previsão do @talkofthecharts, "TEXAS HOLD 'EM" deve passar uma segunda semana em #1 na Billboard Hot 100.
For all the hype this is extremely disappointing. I get that she switched genres and I’m ALL GOOD with that. I love all music.. but this is just a one time listen for me. I had extremely high hopes for it, too bad it’s just well…,mediocre at its best. I’m loosing faith in the industry now. I’m just going to start back on the 90s again.
BeYAWNce!
Them legs 😍
Not my Jam, but congratulations on #1
Horrible!!!!
This sucks lol
May as well just done it naked 😅
Wow more country than most of the crap on the radio
This is not country
Feels like a parody of country
I actually like this! ❤
oh brother.
Country died a long time ago but this is the double tap kill shot.
I don’t like Beyoncé!
Nope
This is terrible....and to try to sell it with a video like this is even worse. "C'mon man...."
This is trash not country she threw a hold bunch of words in a hat, texas lexus tornado this is not what country is about
Wtf makes this country? Just because it’s about Texas hold em? Definitely not country.
Terrible
Best country song ever ❣️
I like it and I'm gonna put a ring on it!  👍
Same old crap video done to a jug band sound.
I love country. It is R and B cousin
Load of rubbish!
This is trash. 😆
This not country. It’s wanna be country from rap/pop artists trying to get every music genre into that.
BeyHive! Beyonce has now surpassed 60 million monthly Spotify listeners for the first time! 👑🐝
Ben Shapiro- Ok, Imma do rap. No one's gonna be offended. They're just gonna laugh at me. While I tell you about triggered snowflakes.  Beyoncé- Aight, Imma do country. It's gonna be a banger. The entitled people who think they own everything are gonna cry, as usual. While they tell you they FordToughs.
💯 🗑️ 🚮
Way to ruin country singing. The outfit is way to sexual and she knows nothing about the country
Shit is wack no lie
I like the song, but I'm not a Lesbian. So I don't appreciate looking at a half naked Beyonce repeating the same hand gesture. Couldn't she had took advice from a actual country star for ideas on a video?
Belongs in a sex tape
best ad for double-sided fashion tape ever
Boring video on repeat. Wish country music still sounded like country music.
#1 on Billboard #1 Country Charts #1 on iTunes #1 Global Spotify. Oh Beyoncé don’t end these haters like that 😂
...nope...
Remember when you didn't need to use tits to sell records. Talent did it for you.
She is  naked and wants to be respected  as country music?   I just deleted the song.
It sounds like the theme song to Franklin the Turtle 😂
Its ok.
What is she trying to say with this video?
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE🤢🤮
I don’t understand the hype of this song. I listen to country music but this song sucks bootyhole
Am I the only one who was like dammit I thought this was the actual music video.....leaves....comes back ...😑........
I think her voice is good, but the music surrounding it isn’t as great as it could be. Ive listened to country my whole life and this … is OK. I kind of feel like they did this for shits and giggles to see what would happen and didn’t put too much effort into it.
It’s called trash
She looks likes she work on Only fans🤢
Music never ceases to amaze me but yet it does. Music has saved me. 🔥🙏❤️
Damn, nicely done Beyonce.
Don't quit your day job this is still a pop song 😅😅😅
Horrible.  I knew this would be a crap song and the PR machine would make it a number one.
This would be just as good if she'd put some clothes on.
I like the song, but where are her clothes? I'm not a man, I don't need to see her body. Modesty seems to be a LOST CAUSE.
You would think she might be a bit more dressed now that she is a mother of 3 ....noooo her tits are falling out...noo ..song is avarage too..
Are you kidding me ❤
Çok ucuz
Garbage.
My teacher let us lisin to this at dance party. Im in 4th grade
Loved her in Cadillac Records and enjoying her country crossover so much. Thx, B!
nope! on wardrobe..good voice catching song
Sorry B.. This video and song sux. Go back to what you normally do. This sure doesn't make for a good country music song or video. try again hunny B.
very boring video
Not a fan - try again
The new franklin song is dope
anyone wondering  if she has nipples?
Disgusting
I don’t understand the relevance of the outfit to the song. I don’t have a problem with the outfit. I just don’t understand what it has to do with the song. It’s not a county outfit. It has nothing to do with cards. Why simulate a gun instead of just having a gun. I like the song though. Despite not getting the outfit, she looks great in it. So, here we are.
The song sounds good but the video does nothing
Not a fan of country, definitely not a fan of this c rap..
The worst attempt at country I’ve ever heard. Old town road was a better attempt and it sucked too
Yesss queen great song
Yh she is a brilliant one
No country here... Only fake try and pretending
This is terrible
This is the most country sounding song I’ve heard in years, well done.
I actually like this song! Not the video clip thing though
WORST VIDEO EVER!!
What ever happened to the genre I love
Okay I fall short of calling this an epic fail. From 1-10, I give this a three. Seriously, it sounds like, as an artist, that got bored and wanted to try something different. Didn't work. You can't just add some whistling, clapping and mention Texas and call it country. It's just bad. Stick to what you know and are good at. For those who read this and want to cry racist, know that I am black. I don't just hand out kudos...just because. There are decent black country artists from Darius Rucker to Rashad (spelled Rvshvd). Check out Rvshvd song "dirt road". He talks about being from "the hood" but also being form the country. He grew up in South GA. Oh and for the record grew up in Compton, CA in the 70s...yeah THAT Compton.
Same people who like this song voted for Biden.  No taste.
Wow. This is the first good song I ve heard from her. This is great
crawfish
beyone did country dolly and pitbull made a song together. non of this was on my bingo card but hell yea keep on suprising me 2024 im loving it so far
This ain’t Franklin
Dance wit Choo is not country. It’s what she thinks is country. Big miss. I wanted it to be good. The video is trashy too. Be better.
Hmmmmm. I like it
Park your Lexus, on the line...   So I can crush that crap with my truck....
A bop
Nope.Not into it.
Worst video ever posted on you tube
What a joke.
Nothing sells like pussy.
Music seems ok but some clothes on.
Please…get real.
Beyonce is so overrated..And why always 'Muricans make everything about race/colour.  Music has no boundaries #Idiocracy #DivideEtImpera
Amazing voice and Beyoncé.   :)
Boo
😂😂😂😂 Get it straight Beyonce, kinda felt you lost your self to demons
This is the “official” video? We not working too hard are we?
WTH? Same over & over! HORRIBLE! Don't give up your day job👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Trashhhhhhhh
Boring video
This is a joke, right?
sounds like an old destiny's child track with country influence.
Why did she have to dress so raunchy? She can make and set trends. Why? Beyonce, you don't need to this ever😢
Where the fucking video with cowboys and Cowgirls line dancing and Cowboys playing Texas hold’em (card games), where’s the fucking dance people please make it make sense! Where’s the video
This new Country music that y’all hating folks on here listen to isn’t even country music anymore. With that said this song is better than 70% of the new country music. Few country artists are actually writing country music anymore. This is as close to country as Jelly Roll, Kane Brown or FGL have ever been. Tell us why y’all really don’t like the song though?
Didn't black folk create country music..
Decent song, but horrible video.
What some shit music and what a fantastic production on this music video.  What a joke!!!!
Whitonce got a hit
She should stick with her own music and being a Native Texan, I absolutely hate it.
I'm so confused
Why?  hmm
I swear I hope she takes album of the year for this. That would make one heck of a statement.
This isn't country guys.
Ngl this sucks this ain’t country at all
Hey its Franklin!
I want back the 5 minutes  i just lost watching this pop song...i hope i never hear that song again
I like the song but was hoping for a better video.
This lame!
Her and Kane Brown bed to do a country duo.
Black Country is so cool
I’m back y’all 🤠👢
I love it ❤
I don't understand the repetitive looping in her videos? I don't find it creative. Please don't tell me there's genius within this simplicity.
How stupid 💯
what she can't sing if she ain't taken her clothes off?
This horrible 🤢🤮. This ain't country.  She ain't even got clothes on and a lot of volgar  with words throw in Trash.
Not so much country here at all
Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, she is not.  Beyonce should stick to her original genre and it is not country music.
Who heard titty instead of city when her fingers ran up her cleavage 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣
Eh not sure I like it. It's catchy. Maybe a few more, seems countryish guess we'll see when she releases more songs. Seems more of a mix of country/ pop/ r&b.
I love you
Why is this #1......
What a boring video. But I do enjoy the song. Seems she is trying to get on the Taylor Swift bandwagon to get her album of the year...gone back to country music 😆
Damn stupid ass video 🤦🏻‍♀️
Damn Beyonce got the YaYa’s on semi display 🫣🥰🫡
This is a great gospel pop song 😊
All you new country fans with this song still ain’t country fans this trash isn’t country!! She needs to stick to her genre!! And stay there I give props when it’s needed and this song does not need any it’s a bad song!!!!
Fucking. Awful.
Why would you just keep doing the same thing over and over? So some guy can spank it to your half naked body?
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
My Queen❤
Sucks and she needs cloths on such disrespect to her self.
if you cant keep your man in line who can
There is nothing country about this song. The banjo doesn't make it country. This one won't be played on the country stations.
why are you naked??????
It’s literally just a ripoff of the theme song for the show Franklin on PBS
Why in the world does she have to get naked? It takes away from the song and very disrespectful to her children.
This really sucks! Go back to your other crappy music plz
This is not country…..  Country music died in early 2000’s
#TexasHoldEm 2:49
Not country it's bluegrass at best but either way it's horrible
STRIPPER..PUT SOME CLOTHES ON
Now i know i get down like that #Illuminati NOW YALL ARE FINISH WATCHING LISTENING ONLY AS MF 2:19
This video fucking sucks bro lol
Played You try me as Beyonce Again 1:05  BANG
And again Beyoncé doing something that Kylie Minogue did before with Golden and Madonna with don't tell me...
😂 This is not country. Wtf is this garbage
I like this song, but damn the video is boring.. 🤷‍♀️
🤠 🐝
Horrible!
Terrible soooo many better sounding female country artists with much much better songs this one was hard to listen to and I like Beyoncé as a artist but stay away from country
Trash
Eh.
♥️
,❤❤
❤❤❤❤
This is not country music…
i prefer a actual southern black women, not some city slicker black women trying to look white...slightly white and blonde huh...everyone knows southern women are thick and dark
Why are all the white folks so mad? Who are you to say this isn’t country? You don’t even know the roots! That’s like me saying Eminem isn’t hip hop💀💀💀
So this is the song that has everyone in a frenzy? 😂
Hey, It's the Franklin Song. https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
I love me some Beyoncé.  However, she’s out of her depth on this.  Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.
THIS IS DEF NOT COUNTRY , just cause they made that beat...  vulgar junk
I don’t like country music but this is AMAZING!!!
Throwing a wackbcountry song out knowing Kelly got a new movie coming out....
Please stop. You are so fucking out of touch with reality lol
What is this 😂
This shit aint country. Its like Beyonce is mocking country music. This shit needs to burn its disgusting
Did Morgan help with this awesome tune?  https://youtu.be/bGlIGCR8hos?si=2anslSxqHDQn_MkH
This is really bad
👎🏻
That’s sweet little turtle Franklin did the song better. ❤😂
booo this song sucks but i will admit goes hard on mute
This is awful
😂 I just thought I was going to hear Hey its Franklin.
Let's get technical all you Scared of My beautiful Black Skin other Folks we created country music going back to 1920s by Gus cannon be my guess and look it up... So all the hate towards bey is 💩
I've never seen anything more disturbing. Why is this video (visualizer) her being a knocked off version of Miley on Flowers except not as entertaining and definitely didn't need to touch herself as many times. I love Beyonce but this wasn't it for her. PS: Miley wore it better and the dance tutorial videos to this song is way more entertaining! I was expecting a lot more from all the hype. 😑😶 PSS: The song wasn't even that good and definitely not true Country!!
Tf she dressed like lady gaga???
This is not country 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Don't debate me. I said what I said. Mhmm. Beyoncé is a African American mixed with European. She does not care about the Dukes of Hazzard feelings about her migrating into the Country genre. There's no racial limits in music! Anybody can sing & dance to country music including black pey who created it in the first place! 😂If she's a dog, well she's one rich dog then because this song is literally about to be played on repeat 🔁 all over the country & the world. The Country Music nation has no choice except to Accept that Beyonce entered the Country Music Competition, so all of y'all should panic. Lol 🤣 She's just going to keep dropping music until she she gets a album of the year in country music Grammy. Y'all  just going to drop a few points lower on the Billboard. It's okay! 👌🏾 Dukes really going to be mad that he can be Googled calling Beyonce a dog after she just made a nice innocent, dance song & his dogs & grandkids going to be square dancing to the new song made in the USA. Wherever country club he goes too, it might make him upset huh? Why? Because she's black? What was wrong with it Dukes? Not old British enough for you? Do she have to make a Hip, Hip, Cheerio music video for you to approve & apologize through Twitter or YouTube? She might go straight British & get the whole world singing African hyms one day. Oh, she did that already. Fighting Temptations. 🤷🏾‍♀️😂This ain't Texas, because if it was.....what she's trying to say is someone would've been Shottas by now by getting on her nerves & she ain't pointing no elbows... yet! I understand everything! She ain't saying who, but there's someone who would've been Shottas by now if it back in the Wild days in Texas before cell phones, cameras, paparazzi, & satellites! Lol  Beyonce is very subliminal & it's hilarious. It's just a song. Go get down & bougie. She's a Virgo who been with a Sagittarius for years, so she knows who to Target. The Country Industry because the Hip Hop industry is controlled & hatin on her huh? Do what you gotta do Beyonce. You should get into Techno music, Rock n Roll & just Chicken Wing it from here on out. Beyonce is technically the only artist I've ever heard say that she has hot sauce in her bag! 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣I once met a guy who told me they call him,"Hot Sauce." Even dudes copy Beyonce. I was internal laughing because I thought of her song. People really follow Beyonce foreal. I just need her to tell her whole Beyhive to cashapp me $100 dollars. Would they follow instructions & get in formation? 😂💯♍ 🎶 🎵 😂
I don't understand why it does the same thing?
😂😂😂😂😂
I'm not a fan of Beyonce but anything we touch turns into GOLD!
No thankyou!!!
This is stupid stick to your own music
Good for you Beyoncé! ❤
Thats crap... Lol  not a country outfit either 😂
The thing is she would look much better in boots and jeans. This outfit is, cringe af.
Nope
It’s a no for me.
whyte folkz
I would like to hear Beyonce do more songs like this.
Wth!?   Now im 20 secs in and the video is stupid good lawd.    Bless her
This is not country.  Beyonce needs to realize she cant do every genre
Im 5 secs in and its starts off gross and inappropriate
I think Beyoncé should stick to her own kind of music. Not a big fan of this one.
Is this really country? And is the video seriously just her half naked shooting a fake pistol?
Why is it always with the slutty clothes?  Many of our black queens in the music industry are doing this. Is this really what you need to do to sell records?
Really? Did she get bored?
This definitely isnt country music. Yall are clowns.
Love the song, don’t love the video….not much effort Beyoncé, missed opportunity imho…
This ain’t country
O no This is terrible
Hey it's Franklin......
This sucks
they don't know.... Mark L.™️👥 😊🙃🤣😂 They still play loud  music inside  their cars. And, looking barbaric.😂 Down South, Can you  believe that ! !  🙃🤣 Note : To uplift our people. Drop a hot song - The ball is in your hands, Nine seconds on the clock. "Gone put it in the basket" ! Change The Change 🎯 😘
Hey it’s the Franklin theme song!
FUNNY HOW THIS ALMOST SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE "THE FRANKLIN THEME SONG???!!   🧐 UMMM YUUUUP!!! U BETTA CHECK THIS WITH THE KIDS. FRANKLIN THEME PEOPLE!!
Sure wish they would show how many ppl dislike !
Like Bea, but leave the nudity out of Country. So unnecessary.
The fit is not Western style, I personally don't think she suits country music. Cowboys and girls have class and dignity, none of which is displayed here.
I'm so proud of you Bee for putting your 👣 on the potential of winning the CMA Awards as an artist and being a black woman. You deserve Album of the Year, but your day is coming. I hope the CMA gives you your flowers💐.
This is NOT country!
Lots of symbolism! I don’t care for the song but if she wants to do it, than why not? TBH why is she dressed like this🤷🏼‍♀️? But she is going to do her and God bless her is all I can say. I’m not impressed.
uh why does the same scene repeat over & over?
Lady Gaga has Poker Face. Ok, Beyoncé has her New Card Game song." Y'all analyze too much, & she's getting paid by having fun singing & playing a card game. She probably got inspired somewhere that wasn't in Texas. Y'all  should thank her. Now females are going to copy her & go buy some cow girl boots, & a cowgirl hat. The Eastside going to respond by saying,"Well, this ain't the WEST, but we're still going to do our Southern thing! UNO! UNO OUT! WE STILL WINNING THE CARD GAME!" Lol The Diva playing Spades Dukes of Hazzard actor is mad for what? Black people been singing country music for YEARS! Beyonce just highlighted this. Does he Not Know that before card, Africans also rode horses, owned our own land, farmed before, were milking cows before, but we stopped doing that because there's Walmart now? Lol 😂 The Supercenter has everything, including playing cards. Does he not know that Southerners are countrified, Beyoncé is from the South? Does he not know that technically he's not from America? He might be from the UK himself, so how does he know what's country? 😂Read up on History. 🤠🏇🏾🧘🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😂♠️ ♦️ 🤣
She running out of ways to be the best ! Nope , no bueno .
Competition with Taylor Swift??  Why does dressing in clothes have a problem🤮  disgrace to Houston
Good song
The video is dumb.
Good song, terrible video, more clothes we don't need to see all that.
All the white hillbillies wanna hate but this song sounds more country than any song released by a country artist in at least ten years.
Basically, it's a song to be understood through funnies. So, people don't get upset it's just cheers though a message. Like, all songs have a message rather it's symbolic or literally given as a message in the name of Texas. Have fun.🖌️
I love Beyonce but she wasn't meant for country music in my opinion it's a weird song to me country has already becom so pop it's loosing it's flare.
I'm sorry but no
All Africans are going to do is remix this song up right quick, add some more Hip Hop beats to it, & The Millennials are still going to do the electric slide, a country bougie, mixed with some twerking either way. Nobody can stop us from putting our own spin to it in general no matter if it's African or European. The Asians are going to dance to her new song too, watch their parents get mad, then secretly join in without their kids knowing. The song is universal. Lol She clearly said,"This ain't Texas, so lay your cards down because I can't read your mind." She's playing poker, Spades, or UNO. LMAO 🤣
Not a big fan of the Lyrics they really make no sense for a Country song, but I really love the Melody because it is a great Line Dance Song.
WTF is this? It damn sure ain’t country!
awful
She is from TEXAs🎉🎉
If that's, "country" I'm the queen of England! 🤣🤦‍♀️🤣🤦‍♀️🤣
Garbage😂
Sounds like shit and she literally plagiarized the show Franklin with the intro
America was built on Country  Tennessee and Texas is the roots of American culture.
Good song
😂I actually like this song. It's not saying anything wrong, it's relatable, some people just want to dance, & no some of us women really can't read a dudes mind because some of them do some crazy stuff, & we have no idea why. It's also catchy & in tune as usual. Also, the Dukes of Hazzard actor was very wrong about saying a dog has to leave their mark. First of all, African people created & started Musical Beats, Rhythm, & Dance! There's NO GENRE OF MUSIC A BLACK WOMAN CAN'T DO. Even though Beyoncé is a lighter complexion, she is still a descendant of Africa & mixed with European like most people in America. Also, Black People have always been in Country Music, I guess the Dukes are just now finding this out that we dominate that genre of music as well. Blues, Jazz, Country, Hip Hop, Techno, Classical, I Don't Care if it's Alien Music, an AFRICAN SOMEWHERE IS GOING TO STILL BE GOOD & CREATIVE IN ART & MUSICAL ENDEAVORS. Stop being racists! Why she gotta be a Dog? You didn't call Dolly Parton a Dog when she blew up her lips & tits to look more African. Stop the Foolishness now! It's Nothing Wrong With Any African American Creating Country Music. This is America. She has the Freedom & Right to say,"This ain't Texas, but she's going to still bougie!" Lol What's the Real Problem Hmm? 🤣 🤷🏾‍♀️
This song is straight trash and disrespectful to country music!
This isn't country music.
Horrible song horrible video, this is disgusting
What a stupid video...
Beyoncé did her thing I love it ❤
😂
Love ❤
I like Beyonce but this isn't country.  Just because you use a different beat and rhythm don't make it country. Plus the whole video is just her and being half naked. Just throwing in some hay and fields and country clothes doesn't make it country.
Symbolism will be thier downfall.  Cultural appropriation.....
Ok, Beyonce just bought trash to country music  damn shame!
The video is disgusting. Guess they think they can't sing if they're not mostly naked
I am the only one is my group of friends that love country music I’m so happy that she did this now let’s see who’s going to be singing country music at the late night  get togethers  😜 🙌🏽
Boring video and below average song.
I am a beyonce fan, but girl get some clothes and clean up the language.
I love it sounds good damn right girl everything you touch is gold
People who don't know what they are talking about liable to say anything.  Keeping it real she sounds just as good as anyone else who's a country music singer.  People don't understand, the original country music was not sounding like it sounded like today anyway.  Like the original rock n roll.  Black people wake the hell up, how in the hell can someone tell you how to sing something that you created.  What we now going to let people tell us what is rap or r&b.
Not country
Song is ok. Just wished she would put clothes on
Beyonce please make some black country music. Slow it down and screw it up for Houston Texas
Infiltrator..
Not really a fan of this is basically country from the 1960s and it probably would have been a hit that you can tell she mixed in a lot of her old gospel music styles I never told us for trying but doesn't like cut it for new country
Isn’t this called the so called “Culture Appropriation “?
Beyonce.. yet again showcasing her versatility and unique style.  I "LOVE" this !!
Is the whole video just an old hag pretending to be a stripper?
Check out Tanner Adell. Thats why Beyonce is doing a country thing now.
Sounds like something AI would generate. 👎
The talent belongs to Rhiannon Giddens, the banjo player. Thats it. Check her out.
WTF IS THIS GARBAGE 😅😅😅😅
ITS NOT THE POINT OF TEXAS YALL OMG ITS THE FACT TEXAS IS CHANGING AND WE NEED TO HOLD IS DOWN AND PROTECT OUR 🔫💪AKA HOT SAUCE IN THE BAG 😢SAD TRUTH BUT SHE SAYING IT TO KEEP IT REAL 🕳️💼OVERSTOOD GUN LICENSE AND TRY IT IF YOU WANT TO #TEXASSTRONG ILY YONCE
would like it better if she danced
Nice Try libbies on infiltrating, American culture who still believes in a better way. Seen through your crap.
That was ... Messy.
This ain't country. 😂😂😂
This sounds more country/americana than a lot of the stuff that's played on country radio today.
She isn’t country she’s a sheep for the left lol. Put cloths on and stop cussing.
Best queen bee 🤍🤍
Heyyyyy it’s Frankln…. Comin over to playyy.
I'd hardly call this country music....
Ummmmm... NOPE...
This isn’t country music…it’s okay but this is not country
This isn't country..try again lol
Feels like a song and video completely AI generated
Idk why but i swear I feel like I heard this song like a year or two ago
This song is horrible
As usual, her sexuality is the only real thing that is any good. I'm sure this was another push from her pimp, Jay-Z
What is this crap???
Dont sound country!
This chick just needs to stop.
This is Beyonce saying, 'My fans will buy anything I do, but if I can add to that legions of new fans who are country in their leaning, that's an untapped profit I want a piece of.'
FRANKLIN 🐢
#RABBIROYSTERRISINGS✊🏽
Yeah I'm sure a guy wants to dance with you when you say "don't be a bitch". Mmhmm.. sure. 😒
No one gonna mention how gross this is towards women?
❤
Hey its Franklin. Coming over to play 🎶
She ain't country and she don't know shit about anything she is singing  Never mind trying to take over county with other people lyrics you sure in shit didn't write it. It so funny watching some already so famous be jealous of artists in country to the point she feel like she gotta make country  You only got those likes cause your basically nude  This video is far from a true country artists
😣
"tHis IsNt cOuntry" white boy opinions arent gonna stop her topping country charts 😂 what a goddess ❤
I heard Chatgpt can kick out a song in 3 seconds
This is horrible!!!
She straight up copied and remixed the Franklin cartoon show theme song 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Country fans are morons but this a banger
Mmmmm pass
Ummm.... Yeah, I'm sorry..... Ummm just slack jawed 😂😂😂😂 ATM....😅 I love her.
Beyoncé’ is neither Darius Rucker or Aaron Lewis. Straight up poser.
She wouldn't be welcome anywhere near any country state or Texas. She's the absolute image of anti-American prejudice and bigotry. Her and her fans and others with her opinion are what tear America apart. You'll find less bigotry and racism with country people. They accept people for who they are, irrespective of race.  They only disregard people who group people by race and opinion. She and her fans believe that anyone who doesn't follow what they say are somehow bad. But you'll find they accept people based on their character and not colour. They want to work together and don't believe any race should bow down another. Y'all believe in things like reparations and think that white people should be apologising and you've taken gender and made a mockery or womankind and womanhood. In the country we believe that each individual is responsible for themselves and not a whole group. Y'all are twisted and believe things like black people should get preference in education and employment because of things that happened over a hundred years ago.  How would you feel if there was a program that gave white people scholarships over black people even though the black people are scoring higher?? Yous would be outraged, and you supporting things like giving black people scholarships over other races ((not only whites)) simply because of their skin colour then you're being deliberately racist.
I love Beyoncé but I don’t think this is country at all. Now Darius Rucker… he totally made the transition from pop to country flawlessly
I wonder since she from Texas and obviously shoots guns if she supports the 2nd amendment or acts like it? She is a Democrat ... Country person huh? Oddly, i dont think the ppl that pay her gonna support it. Umless this is to divide us nore than we already are.
Wow, keep it going, #1 great vibe
J'adore  ....
And....? whatever....
Yikes 😂 I think it’s terrible and the end of the song is worse. The boring video….
Cheesy and cringe as fuck. 🤢🤮
Thank you so much. I needed a good laugh.
Not bad,she is country
❤
Love it!❤
Whenever I'm sad I watch #thefightingtemptations and life's just a little bit better love you Bey
Worst ever made video in music history and I wouldn't call that country at all. Sexiness sells right? Outfit a complete desaster why even bother to put that skimpy stuff on?  😮😮😮
I believe she is letting everyone know she doesn't need back up dancers fancy sets or anything but BEY 🤭💖💖💖
❤😂🎉😅 hope Daddy say SHOOT on this album 🥳😁
I got clowned for loving country music, so glad B drop this joint.
Love you #bey
Well that sucked, just like I thought it would
THIS IS NOT A COUNTRY SONG!!!
almost black americana, almost
Not as good as Daddy Lessons but not as bad as I thought it was going to be!
You all know this ain’t country music lol
Heyyyyyyy it’s Franklin, coming over to play.   Growing a little
😂😂
Jay z is a very fortunate man
This is awful 🤮
This is garbage.
Someone please buy her some clothes ...why must her boobs always be out ...and other parts.....poor  example for her kids..
What is this?!
This frustrates me ruin pop music all u want leave country alone
Huh?  No. 1?   Huh?
She had to be practically naked for this? And what's with the one eye thing?   And gotta cuss,, of course. Why is she even doing this? Could've been a cute and catchy tune, but she has to vulgar it up.
SOoooo authentic 🤪
That's not country
This sucks so much ass🤣🤣 stick to not making music
Garbage 🗑
😂
My aunt was right! "Hey, its Franklin!"
Why doesn't she just go totally nude? She used to have way more class....them days are gone I guess.
The Queen has conquered once again!💃🏾
Sound like on here,  most dislikes the song, so why is she up on the charts. Is  buying her own music or what? JUST CURIOUS.
This song sucks!
I'd rather eat dog puke off a carpet than hear that again. It fucking sucks
This isn't country.
This video is such a disgrace to country! This is not country! Stay in your lane! She sure is right about not being in Texas! Grow some morals! This is sickening!! My kids will never listen to this garbage!
#TANNERADELL #BUCKLEBUNNY bey devoured her 🤷🏻‍♀️
Not country. Hot garbage at best. All y’all saying your now COUNTY fans are a bit off from the genre.
Great song! Gross outfit.
Ripped off the tune from Franklin the Turtle theme song….
I love Beyoncé but she isn't Country
For the ones who are pissed about this..... Cowboys and country are originally black..😊
Very very good ❤❤❤
This sucks!! Smh, sorry, not sorry 😐
There may be lesser critics of Lady B's music with this hit is booming! Taking the music lovers to new heights. It's going to be hard to say that she isn't headed to the top of the chart as a Musical Professional musical artist. She's brilliant like Michael Jackson once was in music that's played and danced to all around the world. ❤❤❤❤ loving it!! Lady B! Hold Em'
Whenever we get the live version of this, it's going to go crazy!
Gross. Also, I can't be the only one who hears the theme song to that kids show, Franklin the Turtle...
❤I LOVE THIS SONG!!! ❤Go Beyonce, go❤love from Finland
get over self worship, B.
Catchy..I guess. I just don’t get why she feels the need to be just about naked. Aren’t we tired of looking at nothing but buns from the leading ladies?
cheese. moldy as well.
Dumb azz video.
Pathetic
This sucks...
Lots of auto tune
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
https://youtu.be/KFjbHeXw1ls?si=garJX66SWtDZXevF
Disgrace… country music isn’t a phase but a lifestyle   We don’t need a another stripper hoodlum video
This is not country music, so no y’all aren’t suddenly country fans 😂😂😂😂😂
So park your Lexus and throw your keys up.  Yeah the only thing country about this is the guitar
Sounds more country than any of taylor Swifts "country" songs
can we right a song
I love u Beyonce  I came to one of ur concerts 💃🎤
ant man that leaves you alone has to be crazy
I love this song… it’s a very catchy tune…
this time let us know
can you do it again
Beyonce finally made a good song.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the choreographer was a 12 yr old boy... real creative lol 🙄
Tangiled up in boo
Country music is the FUTURE
When we've become so full of ourselves we think our titties are enough to carry a whole video for a bland song 😂
This is not country 😂😂😂😂 not fiddle no talking about the rough times just sad a dam shame #dontpretendtobesomethingyournot
I don't get it but then again I'm not a country fan. that is one boring video.
I like it!!!
If this came out in 2012 it would’ve fit that era perfectly, I wouldn’t call this country more indie meets r&b/gospel, but still a little catchy, coming from a rock and metal guy lol
This isnt country🤔
This is pretty bad. However, it fits with all the new pop country garbage.
I miss the times when people used to dress classy
Horrible...n I'm not even a country fan.
Heyy it’s Franklin!
this isn't country, marginal at best for even a commercial pop song.. ..kinda sucks.
That shit is terrible! Try listening to some real country and then you will see that this is horseshit!!!
What dumb video...
The only reason it has reached tops is because people like me want to hear this with all the hype and talk.
Genius! This song is mmmm 👩🏼‍🍳💋 chefs kiss!!
Queen❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Country is not like it use to be with rap mixed in it.
Shit and bitch and the word dam and  titties nope not coutry . But I don't make the rules.
Love it ❤️
Lol. This ain't no country song.   Stick with ya pop crap.
Country?😂.   What’s country about it😂😂😂😂🤷🏼‍♂️.    I wouldn’t even have released this
No F-words or raunchy sexual lyrics like her other crap?
15 second vid on repeat, annoying and no thanks. also country meh
Only lyric i hear is HO DOWN.   Just stop.  Nobody cares
How is this country?... Cause if the banjo?? 💯💯💯
the fact that people think this is a Country song, is actually an insult to Country Music...and no Country Music didn't orginally start with Just African Americans it started in the south with the A mixure of Europeans, Scots, Irish and many others who immigrated here. Such as the Carter family and Jimmie Rodgers in the early 1920's.
Terrible
I'm not sure I like it
More evidence that contemporary pop music is dead because of this insipid shitte
Stupid!
Most female country artists, don't display their breasts. This ain't country😢
She'll try anything to stay relevant at this point.
Boi this shit garbage
Talk about cheesy. What horrible garbage this is. 😂
I won’t deny that Beyoncé is very talented and beautiful , but her version of country isn’t for me as I’m old school country where the female artists are fully clothed and not wearing the clothespins that are used to hang out to dry with.
Dumb ass video Be classy and no swear words  Song is good but could be better
Horrible
Queeen❤
Sounds to close to the Hey It’s Franklin theme song
La mejor canción del 2024
Colombia te ama reina 👑
This is trash 🗑️ this ain’t country
My honest opinion Hold em has good lyrics good music not a fan of the hoochy costume it’s a boring video.
This song is so bad
😍🙌🎺😍🙌🎺
I don’t like it
I really love her voice, but I'm just not feeling this... especially the video
Don't like it, doesn't even sound like country,  she can't sing.
It’s not surprising that non country music fans like this because this is a pop song that someone is trying to sing with a fake country accent. The only reason anyone country likes this is because they’re afraid of being called racist. Well, I’m not afraid. This song actually sucks, country or pop.
This is not country music it's junk and needs to be in the trash
I just like the beat. I can sing this too. Nice outfit though
This songs makes me want to be in a barn line dancing 🤠
This ain't no damn country music lol all of yall saying yall suddenly saying "I like country music now" yeah sure go listen to some David Allen Coe and hank Williams jr that's some really country music
So it is all about her boobs?
Terrible!
She stole the Franklin theme song.😂
Great song stupid boring video WYF
Good thing I’m not big on country music. She’s overrated and a terrible singer and country singer.
This is not country music.
You've got to be fucking kidding me??? This is not country....
What a dumb video
This is the trade out for Tracy Chapman.
Maybe the worst song I’ve ever heard
Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Now i’m listening to Country just because of Beyonce😂👑
The video is repeat…………
She looks like she is auditioning for the new Jardiance commercial.
Hi
This is so lame... wtf 😂 she's better off sticking to her genre music
I hoped there would have been a political message about texas, against far right, but you're still selling your ass ! I'm descusted !
This is absolute garbage of a song lol... This cant be real, this has to be a mock of country music or something.   This has to be written by AI or something, its actually comical.
Yeah not sure how this made number 1 must be like a participating ribbon. Sounds like shit total and utter trash.
This isn’t country. This was a missed opportunity. It’s not good either let’s be real.   If Beyoncé got with the right producer there’s a good chance she could make something good
I don’t care what she sing or do she gotta be half naked good old country girls are dress to impress she sound better country instead of all the other songs
this is so bad she should be embarrassed. holy crap.
Bey get behind me , i can see some rednecks getting mad in this comment section
Not country, she did accomplish what she set out to do and wasn’t for good that’s for dam sure.
This was straight up horrible.
I love it..💕💕💕💕💕🎀🌷
Greetings from Berlin, Germany...we can also make good music... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Byl4yZC_agM
Sucks sucks sucks 😂😂😂
Terrible! 😂
Why does she always have to dress like this ... she has no talent
TRASH
That song is not country also it sucks
I would love to see her do a rock song next!
On what fucking planet is this country?? 😂😂😂
Too bad she doesn’t know how to dress. The song is ok  she needs to stick to pop
Country music isn't skank.
I think she forgot to wear a shirt under her vest. It would have been nice to see her and some dancers in cowboy boots dancing to the song.
😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Ridiculous. What is this. All shes missing is the pole.
So embarrassing and disrespectful to country music
Boring. She would have looked so much better in some great country clothes.
Stupidest shit ever stick to your own crap music
Culture vulture!
Country doesn't need Beyoncé! Her mouth is still dirty! Stick to pop!
Beyonce  is very talented, however song doesn't sound country really, but a mix.I do not care for Beyonces music,alot of her music is really dark  ,and I am not drawn to the dark ,don't  be a b.... honey ,really,she has to put a dash of gangster into all her music, and obviously  alot of people love this, but not me at all. she is influenced by something,or someone ,and not in a good way,😢
Nah, this isn’t it.
Nothing country about this song. It’s not good song in any genre of music. But then tidies be poppin.
Just no!
Ohhh I get it! It’s county because she said Texas and Ho-down!
coincidentally turning into a cowboy
I mean... Meh 🤷🏾‍♂️. Im not even hating it is really regular
I love this and county music 🎶 I’m sure they will have a line dance to this🙌🏼
Could have given this some to Adele
Not real country.
❤
This shit sucks
Garbage
She just wants an award for best album of the year lol
Yuck   She selling her chest or music  nope
Awful
What is the thing on her eye?
Singing with a "twang" in your voice doesn't make it country.
Am i the only one who hears the gambler from kenny rogers?😊
White lesbians bumping this on the way to work lmao 🤣
Wow. Those are some fine tats. 🤠
Gedagedegedagedag o
Stupid
She needs a better video for this
Gross. She sounds good. She’s just crude and gross. That doesn’t usually go with country music. Not the first of course but ew.
Omg🤣🤣🤣🤣 Stupid song and the video is even dumber!
Beyonce the Turtle 🐢🐢🐢🤣🤣🤣
I'm straight up country and grew up country all I will say I don't know any country person who is true country sing or even talk this way so typical no morals
And they still probably won't give that woman Album of the year!
Straight up trash
amazing song!!!
That's NOT country....what a friggin' joke!!
As someone who likes Country music, not sure if I like this.  Maybe after another song or two I'll decide 🎶 lol
This is country? 🤨
Horrible!
Nice song!
This is not a country song this is just using music That's country in making words to it she ain't country she's always going to be pop
She is just pissed of Taylor Swift moving from country to pop and getting attention. She made this to show she can cross over. She is much older than Taylor and should have did a cross over decades ago if she had a desire. All attention and “look at me”mess.
I love this y'all
Hands down, one of the worst country songs I have heard. She should stick with what she does best and that is nowhere close to Country. Just another pop artist doing Pop and calling it country. All modern day country needs to remember what country is and this is not it.
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now reached #1 on Spotify Global as well! 👑🐝
THIS IS LITERALLY THE THEME SONG TO THE SHOW “FRANKLIN THE TURTLE”
What is happening? I'm a Charley Crockett fan (from Texas) and this video comes up and I'm thinking.. "Beyonce? Hmmm....must be another Beyonce?" Nope. They have good music in Texas. Its not country music...its just music. There's no billboard chart for it. Now...I'm going to look up and old song from Chris Rea (someone reading this may say, "Who?" ) song called...,"Texas ". I love Saturdays.
You can take the girl out of the ghetto but you cant take the ghetto out of the girl the outfit is disgusting
Stick to what you do best.   Stay away from country
I don't really like  country  but I think this country  music   beyonce  singing  sound good
Not even close to actual country music, also a true country person would not come out wearing that. Straight up garbage 🤦‍♂️
This song sucks.  Not impressed.
Awful song and the video is worse.
That’s all ? 😂
Nunber one ❤❤❤❤❤
That video is horrible followed close by the song
Wow country music has gone down the tubes if this is country music, most of new country now needs it's own genre other than country music 😢🤦🏼‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Better than Luke Combs if you ask me.
I am a huge Beyoncé fan but I don’t like this. Maybe it’ll grow on me who knows.
Absolutely horrible.  This is not country.  Only reason this song is a hit is because Beyonce is singing it. Anyone else singing it probably wouldn't even get air time for it.
Dumb song oooowww
100% not country!
She said I be damned if I can't line dance with u... In other words, think I can't do country? Hold my hat! I like it💯
Its Catchy ...brilliant o admit
A side of Texas we haven't heard before! Love the title and that it's a shuffle with a bluegrass guitar. Her phrasing is imaginative and masterful. The song repeats without being repetitive. What sophisticated music, and a good song for a fitness class. I wish she had a different image, though. Her porn star costumes and dance moves put me off. I know she's from Texas but I don't see her as one of them. Texans are freedom fighters in harm's way right now and are doing their best to protect our border.
I loved ❤
Cool Queen ❤❤❤
For authentic country music by black females its Chapel Hart. Not this fake crap. CHAPEL HART REAL COUNTRY
This is absolutely dog shit.
Y’all, this ain’t country it’s far from country, if you want country like genuine true country listen to Cody Johnson, Ryan Bingham, Colter Wall, Waylon Jennings, Keith Whitley, Hank Jr, David Alan Coe, Chris LeDoux, Marty Robbins, Tanya Tucker, Tammy Wynette, Reba, Dolly Parton, Dwight Yoakum, Loretta Lynn, Jerry Reed, Red Clay Strays. I could keep going. This is not country music, it’s the modern definition of country music but not genuine country music
Lil nas ex had the best country song
No grammy for this next year then what? More country, hell no
I’m sorry but 1/2 naked and cursing is NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!
Tell Jay-Z all this this who you really directing this to you talking about a your weaknesses how your parents sold you out as a teenager.whrre the endgame your happy ending at beyonce.go work that's all you do you outta touch with reality beyonce.i have Esp I see your spirit it's trap and lost free Beyonce
THIS IS HUGE INSULT! y'all  price is cheap...shes gave you nothing but a boob peak
Mi piace ❤
😂 country? You're kidding right? 🤡
Simply vulgar she shouldn’t have even been filmed hate it only sick guys with sick minds would want to watch her in that outfit no country related
Garbage
CHECK OUT JAMES CHARLES

A bra would be awesome!!
Oh yes all the ancestors in the corn field dancing❤❤❤❤❤❤
Child you from the south. We still run tings down there. Respect the negroe in us❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
Oh my❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's not a good song. But congrats
Her lower register is so rich and beautiful.
Terrible
I don't know what this, but is sure as hell ain't country.
You know how I know she wrote this? Because it sucks!!! Lmao
This song sucks balls
Horrible
Damn sorry guys
Just stop it’s time to retire
A country singer come on man
Beyonce from Texas and history will tell you country music was African America music  thank you Beyonce for own it back to its right  owner.😍
Black folks is the heart ♥️ of country music 🎼
More tits but still Madonnas idea
This is more gospel than anything lol
Wow Beyonce!!
Nope I'm sorry I don't like this . Why do you have to be 1/2 naked anymore to sing a song . PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!!!! give me Dolly , Reba , Loretta  any day
This is NOT country music 🥴
TRASH 🗑️
I think I'm gonna be sick 😫
What an amazing voice, sad tho, it’s amazing what the elites make these puppets do
Isn't this the Franklin theme song??🧐🧐🤔🤔
This isn’t country music darling you need to find you twang girl
OMG Just Wow I Love it my new Favourite Beyonce Song on Repeat ❤ 💯
Oh my.  I am here for the fragile white comments and I am not being let down.
Remember tim mcgraw and nelly
Makes sense why she's whiting up...
Horrible
Switched genres, still mid 😂
That moment when a country/redneck rap artist won a Grammy for album of the year and her husband went ape about it so she had to bring out a country song. Sorry, bey. You’re not the best R&B artist, let alone country. Also, you weren’t even the best part of destiny’s child.
It says a lot for real country music when this song makes it to the top. This is proof country music isn't country anymore.
And just like that, we finally realize country has been dead for about 30 years 😢
This is really the video?
Cool song never thought I would listen to this mix Beyoncé can sing everything
The video is so very not country, and forgive me "beehive", but id rather not have to watch beyonce naked,  to hear some good old country music. B, being from texas, has every right to b in this genre, but a classier video, to go with the, again forgive me, classier more conservative audience associated with country music. The song itself, its ok. I could get used to it
Now this song I like. 🎵 ❤ it needs a better music video, though. Lol
Amen, Amen same. Que Viva country music ❤️🌈❤️
Jak ,,jednoduchá ,, píseň, tak stejně ,,jednoduchý,, klip. 😂😂😂😂
Slaaaaay🔥
Go listen to Franklin the turtle theme
Special effects look cool.
Gues she wanna lose out on “Artist of The Year” in country too 🤠
No one would like this song if it wasn’t Beyoncé
❤
Terrible music and videclip. "I know this music is terrible, so let me show my boobs to recevive more likes".
Such a pathetic video! Again and again looks like selling her body😅😅😅😅
Garbage.
Trash
Stick to what u know
What the hell is she wearing? Put some clothes on. This does not represent Country music!
Never did care much for cuntree singin. Less it's Hank Jr.
This wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  Still a fan of her music but this song isn't it. Damn I wanted to like it so much.
Why does it sound like Franklin? Like way more obvious than Blurred Lines sounded like Got to Give it up.  https://youtu.be/injtQDE5GXQ?si=xJYP7yWK0c953eu9
Sheesh that walk ❤
Well I’m Black American and I don’t like the song. It’s not country to me. My opinion and I’m not going to consign anything that is Black and be made to feel bad because I don’t. Beyoncé ain’t all that ….Damnnn
Copying Shania much? 😅 video is tacky and cheap and best left to the likes of Kim K etc.
So this is what happens when your rich and your writers say lets see if we can up the sale of cowboy hats and boots 😂 so after you go to said concert they collect dust in your closet cause your not line dancin at your night club  😂🤣😂
I feel like country music hits home when aimed at either suffering gratitude or truth … catchy tune but lacks depth for me
If you have to try to cross over to country music then try respecting the roots and put some clothes on. Catilac Records would be happy with this or even Motown.
Well that song was so cheesy and really wasn’t that good. Stay in your lane B
❓LOL
A #1 Global hit!!!
There’s nothing country about this.  It’s all pop.
She's no country music artist
Booooooo!!
Terrible
She’s always been overrated as a singer .She’s really bad
Is this why i seen A Compton Cowboy shirt at Walmart?
👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽🤠👢💃🏽👯‍♀️
THIS DAMN SONG SUCKS!!!! AIN'T NOTHING COUNTRY ABOUT THIS SONG!!!
Hey, it's Franklin Coming over to play Growing a little Every day  Here he comes with all his friends They've got stories Got time to spend with you Hey, it's Franklin Coming to your house Hey, it's Franklin Coming to my house Hey, it's Franklin
https://youtu.be/WIxdqZ2C52c?si=mKp_STG9QFgiapm6 Sorry but Miko Marks one my fav country singer is the best .. you all need stop acting like Beyonce is the first African-American country singer sorry she sounds to pop ..but Miko Marks is one of the best country singers
she just copied anne marie video regarding the shooting
Why is she naked??? Nosense
SHE CAME THROUGH ONCE AGAIN.
What annoying is everyone acts like she the first African-American country singer and she not ..research ..Charlie Pride is my favorite.  You all need stop calling everyone racist because to me hers  sounds like pop not country.  Go search up the great black country singers they sing so much better and i love them .
Great  song  this  ant texes
Best country I've heard in decades !!! BRAVO !!!
Boring, why bother with the vest and what’s with the teaspoon on your face😂if your gonna try naked get some tips from a professional it was not very pleasant to the eye considering you are a massive entertainer.. I think you could of done better
👎👎👎✊
That’s the video!!! 🤷‍♀️
Lmao oh homegirl Nooo. B Burn this track and don't look back
Low budget crap
Crap
Country music and country living is a lifestyle.  Regardless to who started the genre.  You're better than this. Please Respect yourself and the people who appreciate the fine craftmanship and artistry of all genres.
Beyoncé🤝country music
Mk ultra Beta
It's rnb over a country beat...k.michelle Tennessee is better imo
I thought this was supposed to be a country song.  This ain't country.
Just a rerun of smut in this video. Have some class if you're going to try country.
Wow what a pile of poop
Why even bother with a music video?
Dolly doing rock,Beyonce doing country.Gretchen Wilson - Redneck Woman WINS!
Not country. She needs to listen to Bluegrass and understand it then maybe she’d get what made country music. How did this make any chart??
But whyyyyyy
She gets worse every song lol and Jay Gonna say ohh she didn’t get album of the year lmao
Why's she so fine yet cringy as f
i thought this was a parody but no beyonce for real on this one lol. she getting lazy. now that she turned 30.
Bitting of Kenny Rogers Gambler.
Unreal!!!
As a person who really doesn't like country... But growing up we were forced to listen to it because my father was really into it. So i know what it should sound like. This isnt it. This song is okay not the worst but definititely not the best. I believe she probably could do a lot better. I do wish she would stop doing what EVERY singer in the industry is doing, Staying half naked. It's not necessary. No, im not hating on her. Just completely over every single woman singer now is naked and every other word is profanity.  I wouldnt call this country.. more like country pop. I actually really liked her, until she took something personal from Tina Turners life, (her being abused) put it in a song and made it okay. Ps. We need to stop bringing the balck/white thing into it.. there have been many balck country singers that did very well.  We also know the origins of county music comes from the blues. I am glad that Dolly is supporting her though.
Beyoncé can sing like no one else but this just ain’t it sis😬😅 & it’s unfortunate because I wanted to love it when I first heard she released a “country song” 🫠
Could this jam be any more relevant ❤
good song video boring
Never be a country singer, obviously not making enough from the usual same old same old songs she sings, the way she is dressed is an insult to the true country singers, put some clothes on and stick to the usual warbling songs you sing, sorry absolutely rubbish.
Terrible music.
Not the biggest Beyonce fan but can appreciate her music and the transitions it has gone through... but this.... this is a BANGA.
Pure BULL shit !!!!
Sad she has to be almost naked to sell music.  No talent shown here.
@Beyonce my 9yr old granddaughter said granny have you heard the new @Beyonce song. I been listening every since then.
The song is alright. But, the video is cheap and crap
Avoid saying vulgar words in beautiful songs.
Nice song babe 😊😊❤❤
Brilliant but why half naked? I guess I'm too old to get it 😂
Beyoncé serving like a queen 😍
Legit thought this was an SNL skit. Unfortunately it’s not.😬
97.5 corpus christi won't play this. Right?
Good music.  Terrible video.
I just forwarded video and Im dissapointed now. Whats with this video? Its just boring, I couldnt listen to the whole song coz the video was just boring. Why would anyone do this???
This is a beautiful song yo bright tears to my eye.. see she put kool on country I love it
WOW 💜
This is horrible
I get shivers white people ppl bout to be mad 😂😂😂
Comedy gospel, sounds good for a Tyler Perry movie
I don't really listen to country.  Is this how it sounds? I've never seen any country stars dress like this? I know Dolly who I have always believed to be the Queen of Country never went on stage  without a shirt or pants!!!
Cultural appropriation, I thought black was king 🤡
❤❤❤love it and time for a new generation of 2024
Is this cultural appropriation?
Country is in a seriously bad place if this came out as number 1 on the charts, and I mean any chart!
Great song but why the outfit?
Oh look it's the illuminati queen who is on Epstein's pedo lsland flight log list.
So everybody is just going to pretend this is country. 🤦‍♀️  I’m really surprised she put this out, this is terrible. She could have done so much better with that song, needs a Ryan Tedder touch in writing and production.
Any chance for album of the year?  😂
This shit ass bruh.
😂😂 this is so 🗑️
people like what they like. bobby womack gladys night ray charles have all recorded country songs . some will say thats not country but i rember eddie rabbit olivia newton john and a few more . people like what they like .  that duke of hazzard guy drank to much maga kool aid.😅😅😅 .
WTH is this!
This vid is so stupid
Cant believe jay z was okay with her dressing like that
Yeah, I'd like to think you care about country music outside of this song. 🤔🤦‍♂️
All I hear is the Franklin the Turtle theme song.
No country  soul just pretending to sounds like.
This song is not REAL COUNTRY!
Country lol
OMG! You have to be kidding me! This is NOT country and that video is almost porn!  That is horrible!
I liked it best with the sound off, and the screen on something else.
This song has an vibe but the thing that gets me is what she's wearing in the music video..I'm just not an fan of it
The director should be fired for putting out such a stupid  video. The song was good,  but her doing the same thing over and over again was stupid.
Not a country song
😂
This ain’t country FOH
This ain’t country
Taylor swift 😍 beyonce is coming for you
🤮🤢🤦‍♂️
I guess you just have to do a fake twang and throw on a cowboy hat and poof your country 🙄
Genres are for music, not the musicians who create it.
😅😂🤣 mid life crisis 😂😂
The best thing Beyonce has recorded .Its a genuine country blues stomper and far superior to all the tuneless r and b stuff that she normally records .It will annoy all the rednecks who misguidedly think they have ownership over country music .
When you order a country song from Wish .
🗑️
🙄🙄🙄
No this is not it
Wow! This video must have taken minutes and a few brain cells to create!
If you are suddenly a fan of country music because of this song, what you really are is a Beyonce Knowles   fan. Because real fans of country think the song is awful. The success of this song in country music charts is due to her already established fan base supporting her crossover single into a genre they don't really listen to. To country  music fans it's cringy at best. It's not a good song. I am a metal head myself but I  know what good country sounds like.
This is such a shame to call this Country, especially after we just lost the great one and only, TOBY KEITH! He was Country down to his soul. He went to those wars to hang out with the Soldiers, sing for them, and didn’t make one penny doing all he did for Our Armed Forces! He went 19 times. I know this would be a slap In his face, if he saw someone singing country with no shirt on. Thank God for our classy Country Music Singers.  R.I.P sweet Toby Keith, we will never allow such as this Country Music. She needs to stay over in her hip hop, unless she’s willing to dress the part of being a Country Singer!!! Just so sad, to take Country music down this low, Beyonce. You have a daughter looking up to you, And we have children that love Country music! Please don’t bring that Illuminati crap over to Country Music!!!
I like it!
Heyyyyyy. Let's gooo!
Oh dear 😢
Yeehawww mawma
horrid rendition of "country" music. accoustic pop is more like it
Oh nah
Illuminati one eye thing. She’s a very bad person. Yall should research
I wanted this..but the video and the song is not Texas.
Not a country fan at all. Question…do country videos usually have boobs hanging out in them?
This shit is State
SHE STOLE THE MUSIC FROM THE FRANKLIN CARTOON 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love it!
i love you bey but idk how to feel about this song
Ig its the year i become a beyonce fan lol
Anybody else only hear "The Gambler" when the music starts?
I dig the song. WRONG music video for this song! If we're going country. Let's go all the way. You cannot go half ass country!
I hope this song will finally be the one that allows Beyonce to finally obtain the Grammy Record of the Year in 2025, and woo the country and rock voters to finally give their vote to her.  It’s such a travesty that Billie Eilish already has two, and she has none
Texas 🤝 Country
I’m just waiting on a d🥰pe ass line dance🤞🏾💕🤞🏾💕
That is pathetic and no way a number one country song
Okay she could’ve at least put the lyrics and honestly I don’t like it. Bey WHY DID YOU DO THIS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is what hip hop artist think Country sounds like. Just like that horse song
Beyoncé black version of Carrie underwood need collab
🤢🤮
She need to put some clothes on she can sell records without being naked!!!
"not a fan of country but this hits different" yeah because it's BARELY country 😂 but sure it's alright. I mean, it's Beyonce, all she makes is bangers
WTH is the matter with her?
Yall need to stop thinking she can do everything! The only thing  country about this is shes from texas.
Can we get some 2A support here miss Bey?!
😂😂😂😂😂 yea, no... Stick to what you usually sing Bay
Your song is great, well the lyrics and vocals are wonderful.
Sleeze!!  NOT COUNTRY!!!   Catchy tune but will NEVER be invited to Grand ol Opry hopefully!!! TRASH!!  Whats wrong, trying to add to the fast growing country population!!
Nope! Nope! Nope!! not enough country lol
She knows that the song blows so she decided to throw some tit visual for likes😂😂😂
For all the haters... female Johnny Cash.. that's the outfits vibe. It's very country.  Outlaw music.  I love it.
Wtf?! Thats classy country. NOT!! 🤦‍♀️
Ummm….nope.
Frequent flyer on the Lolita express 🤮
Wow what trash lol
Epstein island
I’m a Texan ever since I was born
I liked the song. It reminded me in places of Lyle Lovett's  LA  County.
Wasn’t she and her hubby frequent flyers to Epstein Island? Yep. Disgusting 🧙🏾‍♀️
She is really evolving country music for our young ladies. What a treasure to watch. Get it girl . I remember when electric guitar came into country. Get it baby and don't stop your passion
Dumbest video I ever saw
Ye n bianca influance style
She has strayed away from destiny child and has become more revealing since then I like the song but I’ll never look at her the same since leaving destiny’s child she’s a real disappointment to me as one who had so much going on with out revealing herself all the time not lady like.
Disgusting.   Beyonce is anything but country.
✨🔥
Get over yourself Beyoncé!  This isnt country. why you need to dress like this?  I have not respect for you!!!!  Get over whether your are black , white or yellow.  I tired of having to being “political correct”.  I dont agree with your focus!
She is giving country some flavor. 🔥
P.S. What's with the black pseudo "country" genre? Get bored, didnt know what other avenue to take? Madonna had a dabble in it too, with her "white" cowgirl phase. Is that a symbolic MK Ultra program - an - I'm so tough image? The majority of  people dont like country music, so what's the purpose of all this? Self sabotage?
Can’t wait for the controversy when she wins stupidest music video of all time 🎉!!!
I’m not impressed.  Video is also no imagination and poor execution.  She needs to stay n her lane
Real country!!!❤❤❤❤
Dein fucking Ernst? Lächerlich !
This song + visuals are  the most boring ridiculous repetitious illuminati waste of time video. What's the point - really? No wonder she has never won artist of the year, or album of the year if she keeps churning out rubbish like this. How come her daddy + big boss that she worships + sacrifices to, hasnt kept up with his end of their bargain, + its awards in these categories? Are these her humiliation ceremony rewards. Her "god" is a deceiving, lying, betraying, rip off conman. Shes not getting it, she's too far down in the black pit of darkness + despair to see what's happening to her. Shes not cool, + cool is not cool, it's cold + frozen over - like hell
Nope. Sorry.
There is a young black woman named Tanner thats been doing country and her music is way better the beyonces want to be country
She's not longer black
https://youtu.be/UNMKZpawiEU?si=eJGbQJzK3NVgX0Zr
Respectfully this shiet is sooo mid. All the rave reviews just goes to show how loyal her fanbase really is lol. It sounds repetitive af and definitely ain't country, maybeee more country pop
Had to hear it myself before I can judge. Didn't like it as a country song. But I got a tinctures vibe from it believ it or not. She is talented but this song specifically should not be considered country just because it has a guitar to it.
This number 1?  What a turd
Beyoncé is amazing, but this video is absolutely awful. Weird song and not country. 🤷‍♀️
I dont like this visualizer. She just made a hoe down song dressed like a .... its distasteful.
Omg rip my eyes and ears please and erase this wannabe crap from my mind....lord....
It's a fun song but I wish she would put some clothes on.  Boobs aren't real and it would be a nice surprise to see them covered.  It's not just her, that's why I'm so tired of it.  And I totally realize its MHO only.
It's the Hey its Franklin song. Rip-off
I don't quite get how the outfit plays into this song. 😏
This is abuse  to country music
What’s funny is this is closer to old school country and western than any of the country on radio these days
This is not even country
Definitely not country music. That was really bad.
YUK!
Bubble gum pop. Absolutely nothing country about this song. Looks and sounds like something played in a strip club. I suspect you could sing country.but this is definitely not it. 👎👎👎👎👎
Disgusting……. Country singers wear clothes.You are totally disrespectful to the genre.
Lovely voice.
Beehaw! 🐝
So Desperate for artist of the year huh . 😂😂😂
Pathetic
Ok how many takes? 😂
This is wild.... Like a for joke silly ass song just to what be invited to cmas? U know everyone gonna look this up which will make it trending which will make it top song even tho it is complete TRASH. If your going to do country music.. u shld shld sound like cornbread Not soul. Wtf
It looks like the Carters will do anything for money. They have taken country music lovers that love the lyrics and stories and threw exhibition on      r 3:57  it.Stay in your lane little sister.You are a great entertainer you are not an opera singer or rapper nor reggae singer. We know it’s not the money.MsPatsy Houston Texas
Lame
I don't disagree that Beyonce is an extremely talented singer, dancer and overall performer. However, this song and performance looks and sounds like she's just straight up making fun of Country music. I think that is just being petty.
Nope
If this is the future of country music, I`m done listening.
Hard nope. Turns my stomach. THAT IS NOT ART. IT IS PORN
Why didn't she dance I sure was waiting But i gather she didnt have enough clothes on😢
Why Beyonce stealing Franklin's theme song. She's definitely hotter than Franklin though. She is Smokin!!!!
This ain't no country music song at all.  She'll never make it in the country music genre. She won't be winning any Grammys for country, that's for sure!
She is a joke. This lady couldn't win album of the year in her genre she she felt like she had to go into a different one to try and get an album of the year. You know, it's funny how her husband said at the music awards that some people don't belong in the categories they are getting acknowledged. Lol,but yet his wife is trying a completely new style where she doesnt belong . Just because you are from Houston doesn't mean you are country. Girl give it up. I think she is making a mockery of Country and that annoys me. But hey, if people don't know any better we'll their incompetence is not something that I can fix ...lol.
Tanner Ardell is a young Biracial country singer that's already sporting long bleach blonde hair with cowboy hat for a very long time now. She plays guitar and writes her own music.  https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YMEggAsCarQ
⚔️ Not even country at all. 👎👎👎👎👎
Dumbest video ever for a decent song.
I thought she retired..... usually when you retire, you dont come out with new music every other year
The sleazy side of country? This is awful.
Adding a banjo and "Texas" don't make it Country. And can't there be a song without curses in it? Like dang. This song better not play on 105, that's one of the few stations that aren't ruined. 😂
🎶hey it’s Franklin🎶
Lol, this is country pop. For those people out there, you just dont wake up and your country. It's a lifestyle. I can promise real country people will not take her serious.
This is not country,  sad what country music has become
Song absolutely sucks!    Sorry guys
Pizses me off that people think it's a country song!!! It's NOT COUNTRY  STAY IN YOUR LANE BEYONCE
I like the idea of this song 🫶😁
Hell NO !!! NOT A COUNTRY SONG!!!!!
Denazify Wall Street Hollyweird Bankers Dystopia pimping Brown performers relegated to Massa money making mules
This shit sucks
Love the song but awful video. What the...? She phoned it in for sure
The video is the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen
yuk!
And I question how is this song a number anywhere...take away the video..just listen to the song and it's the same riff over and over and over with different words...
Ok , Kenny Rogers...plus what is the half naked, cyborg pirate gotta do with the song? I'm soooo confused...but hey to each is own.
Every time I see Beyonce looking so 🔥🔥🔥 the more I hate Jay Z. Fawk that dude....🤣😂🤣🤣
Am I the only one who thinks this is terrible?
NO🤮 Nothing country about it!  Sounds like she’s sneezing🤧   Put some clothes on, this is not rap!
Hot take: this 100% isn't country. Now before you fight me...this is absolute GOSPEL music!
Everyone: Beyonce gone country.  Me: Howdy Cowgirl Beyonce!!
This is not country....not sure what I'm even listening to. Most overrated celebrity. I liked her when she was with Destiny's child but after that, not so much. Always seems like she's trying too hard.
Nice song but that's not country 🤔I thought she would wear daisy dukes which I love.
Big Bet fan but nobody did country like K. Michelle bc she actually grew up in Nashville so it’s in her blood. This just looks like something else to do for Bey. Country music is so about heartbreak and break ups. Is this a hint?
I'm sorry I just really don't like it.
Franklin....
Waste of the 2/3 minutes I spent watching it. Not a fan!
I’m a country girl also a cowboy girl😊
Shit fiyyah
Worst video I've ever seen in my life and I've seen some shity videos
Sucks..
Replete with masonic symbol.
Trash
Nice guns.
This bullshit isn't country music, coming from a fellow Houstonian....Knock it off. This "music" sucks donkey balls. Beyonce has always been ridiculous, but much so more with claiming this song and album is country. This is a country/rap song that has been inspired by the other shit.
Snoozefest
Listen to the Intro. She totally ripped off Madonna.  https://youtu.be/gLFWRDsx5AI?si=WzEav3lRMlHuQp2q
Crap song by an equally crappy artist. 💩
Sounds pretty desperate to me.😂😂😂😂😂
Cultural appropriation.
as a fan of country music ...... what the fuck was even this? is it good to you because its her? or is the song good?  i think there are big fans propping this up, but this wont be a song that is listened to in my truck because its ..... crap sorry nice to see her try but maybe leave the country music to country people
THIS AINT COUNTRY BUT OOOOOKKKKK !!!!!! WACK
My Beyoncé ❤… beautiful girl… making the most beautiful Russian girls RUN for their lives..   BEYONCÉ your beauty is out of this world👌🏻… not to mention your voice and dance ability!…. Daaaammnnn!.omg ..  Okay .. I better shut up 🤫 lol   But..  I love you Beyoncé … so so so much
This video seems so lazy & undercooked. But I love the song
So Lady Gaga can make an album where she's dressed up in a pink cowgirl outfit and singing with her guitar and twang, and no one gives her shit, but the second Beyonce does it, she's "trying to take over country"?! 😂😆 Shows how low your standards are in the country if you're scared of Beyonce taking over the genre.  HAHA
This video is more like soft porn to pop music because of the visuals. Wearing high hip cut thin crotch bikini bottom. While slowly moving her hand up next to her partially bare breast seductively.  How can you make a county song belittling Texas. A lot of country music  originated out of Texas.
Beyoncé… Beyoncé 😍… I love her name!… the beautiful girl can singgggggg!… my baby! Although I’m younger than her age wise(few years)..… but she’s killing it…. Invincible as f**k!…. My Beyoncé.. the girl who can sing, dance,& genuinely have a good time on stage… I love you Beyoncé
Soft porn.😱
This is not country.....BUT I like it👍
Rubbish 👎👎👎
Is this a mocking parody?  I seem to recall this thing called cultural appropriation.  If this ain't it, then nothing is.
THE DIRTIEST COUNTRY EVER
There is nothing good about this song. She is not a country singer at all.
I’m happy to see all the racists country folks trying not to enjoy this
This is more her style the other stuff is getting worn out so I’m not a country fan but I’m about to be ..FIANALLY🔥🔥💃💃
No country artist dresses like that her finger must be tired from all that fake shots.  Give it a zero
This sucks
She ruined the country music industry! 😢😢😢
This song sucks
I  love it go bitch yesss ❤❤❤
Not the most inspiring video. Let down for the song
So her album.of the year will be country 😅
More pop country trash
BOOOOO!
This had to have been the most inexpensive YouTube videos ever made.
What’s and the Lil Wayne rap rock is this  bulls***??
There are some excellent black country artists out there, Jimmy Allen, Tony Evans Jr., Chapel Hill to name just a few. This is not one of them. Making fun of country living to a country beat does not a country song make.
The songs good enough why be half naked
It sounds so serene and upbeat!
That ain't Country.  The song sucks.  And the Video is rated R.  That ain't Country.
This is not that good and country is pretty easy to do
Junk pure junk
Still not album of the year...
Texas Love 'em ❤️ song
Awesome!😎
It's funny how Taylor Swift took the spotlight from her she had to go to country😂
Lady, you sound good, I love this song. Im from TN, love me some country music.
What kinda  video is this what a waste of film 🙄
I knew it was sooner or later - she wouldn't wear a shirt with her leotards.  Can't this woman afford clothes?   Singing talent shouldn't have to depend on wearing leotards and no shirt.  I can't take any female singer seriously - dressed like that
this is not country.
That there is CountryFishin' and my crackerjack self wont have it! 🐶🐶💩💩 It's a nope for me.
Very feminine and badass.  Lot going on in there
Such a boring video..🙈🙈🙈⛄⛄. The most boring of the country songs 😅
Such a boring video..🙈🙈🙈⛄⛄. The most boring of the country songs 😅
Video? Pretty lackluster.
That sounds just like rhiannon Giddens on the banjo
It’s aight.
Weird
😂😂😂😂
Very disappointing.
I like the song but I don't know why a grown woman needs to be naked in a video.  *sigh*  smh   You're Beyonce.  If you set a decent precedent people will like it.  You don't have to keep up with the strippers turned rappers n'shyt.
This ain’t country
The song is old-fashioned country and western and the repetitious video is boring; she's doing the same routine over and over and over. I wonder whose ingenious idea this elementary video was. Smh !
Stick to your own kind of music you don't need to corrupt country with your Satanic crap
This definitely is not country. Who she fooling. This some cheesy song trying to hard to win the country fan base. No ty
104 song writers on this album n this is what they came up with lol...
black people claiming they invented country. lol. Funny how they claim to have pretty much invented everything.. I'm pretty sure they helped invent enslaving their own people and selling them into forced labor... Oh, that's the one they don't take credit for... Even though it's true..
That’s a sorry Country song, I’m sorry if I offended anyone . Skip that
Beyonce is one of the fallen angels/ demons that got kick out from heaven for their rebellion. A lot of them are in this generation (‘celebrities, politicians, scientists) Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon🙏🏼❤️🕊REPENT, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again
i’m in love with the finger gun  ❤  @Bey
Love Beyoncé but not this song.
This is better than pornhub or onlyfans
Cultural appropriation perpetrator.
She sounds so bored. This isn’t country, this is Beyoncé being burnt out and spinning it as country.
This isn't country. This is pop with a twang.. Pop music is cancer that is ruining all genres.
Assim com o vídeo fica repetindo a mesma cena várias vezes, da vontade de repetir a música várias vezes.😊
Its ok. Too slow for me. I like the chorus. Hopefully she remakes the video. This one's giving an Cowboys and Aliens vibe...😂😂😂😂
This sucks
Someone should’ve told Beyoncé she didn’t have to turn herself white to be a country singer.
I like the song, but as a lifelong country lover, I don't know that I classify it as country.
It's easy to pay your way to number one on the billboards and berate radio stations that don't wanna play this. Lets be honest, this is subpar and really not all that great. Kind of basic and elementary when it comes to the sounds and lyrics. Sad that people are made to bow down to this out of fear.
Complete garbae.
Country is rooted in AFRICAN MUSIC, and has always been innovated by WOMEN & PEOPLE OF COLOR! It is also sexy, true, dirty and righteous! It belongs to no one and all!  Bey, thanks for having Rhainnon Giddens on this song 🎵 🪕🔥   She and many others broke down doors for you and us Black Country, Folk, Acoustic Singer Songwriters in the 21st Century! ❤🎉❤🪕❤ 🎉🪕❤🪕❤🎉❤🪕   STAY CALM - Country, Rock & All American Musical Genres is African Roots Music - & CARRY ON!   💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥
🗑️
Same argument I had with Swifties during put a ring on it. Beyonce is the real deal with a real American touch.
Country girls dress proper.
None of the other country stars come on stage half naked or 3/4 naked
This is not county
I’ve never been into mainstream pop / rnb and honestly probably couldn’t be more than three Beyoncé songs. I also really don’t like a lot of modern pop country but I do like the occasional old-school country. This is that. It’s great.
LOL WHAT IS THIS
Video is lacking.
Sounds like A.I. generated "Country".. This is the very definition of "Fake".. Nothing real about this.
Not a fan of this but congrats to her for charting on country music. I'm not a fan of country music.
That is not country music, stop it!
Not my cup of tea. Some folks may like it. It's not for me.
This is driveline NOT country. I don't care of she switches up her sons,  but don't call out something it clearly isn't. It's pop...
Willie Nelson should do a gangster rap album wearing a jock strap.......geez....c'mon man
I know the franklin theme song when I hear it 😂 B aint slick
So why tits ..,country album weird
How dare a demon sings a song to texas
But it don't sound country at all
I’d like the song more if she’d get some clothes on.
Pinned comment…Nah not a country fan in 2024 cause this ain’t country so that’s cool those of us country fans aren’t worried 😂😂😅😅
Trash button😂>
❤❤❤
❤
Maravilhosa! 🇧🇷❤️
Wait do I hear franklin the turttle theme song? Is it just me... it has a similar melody..
This is one of Beyoncé’s best videos right here! Surprised she wasn’t nominated! 🙄
Why would this be a good song to line dance to!?🤠
While the tune is good. Shes not country.
There is nothing country about this! Beyonce needs to stick to hip Hop that's what she's best at.
Fire B
Cmon, this is garbage.
Put on a shirt and you may be respected in country just saying
Normally, listening to Beyonce sing makes my ears hurt but this is kinda cute
Why do them folks have to make everything about race? It’s a nice country song. Black people have been making country music for many many years.  Indeed, the word ‘cowboy’ was initially reserved as a racist term for black men. The white men were called cowhands.
Just Wow from this daughter of Texas. Proud to be American when she's number one in country!
I’m nobody but just a little bit less esp on the percs will give you more movement
LOL!! This sucks
Expected greatness. Could only withstand 15 sec. 😢
🤢🤮
This ain’t country 😂
This is the most boring video ever!
While she has some music I can listen to I'm not a Beyonce fan. She's got an amazing voice and performs well, however this in my opinion isn't great and the video is trash! I do believe she could do a nice country song if she really applied herself. I'm not sure where this came from or if it was rushed but it's not showcasing her true talent and for God sake put some clothes on it's a country song not a club or bedroom song! Sry Bey but I have to be honest.
I actually love this song, but not the music video.  Why?  Beyoncé is keeping on repeating the same moves over and over again!
She probably gon do Techno next
Please put some clothes on
Trying to make country music slutty. No thank you.
Real country is culture, not a genre. If you ain't lived country, you ain't country. This is the very definition of "Fake."
Take it all back. everything we created. We are the culture.
HORRIBLE! Stupid video too! Go back to pop Beyoncé!
Beonce Doing Country? Isn't She Number in R & B? Country  I just dont see it.
This song is fucking trash
Not good at all.  Nothing country about the video.  Boring
It's about as much country as the Chicken dance...
Hip hip Kountry.
as is with modern art exhibitions, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. guess ya gotta be into it, to be into it. if you dont like country, well, then ya probably wont like this song. i like it, but you wouldn't have seen me seeking out Beyonce's music anytime in the past. i mean, im not all of a sudden a super fan of hers, but i can respect what she has done for music in general for the last 20 years. if this is what she wants to do, then by all means go full throttle, ya know? what's the worst that can happen? some people not listen and like it? some, not all. my biggest concern is that it will create even more of a racial divide than is present now. people who think in terms of nothing but racism will do that. unfortunately. i think she would be a great ambassador for todays country music genre. there's a void waiting to be filled in country and an even bigger one to be mended with rock and roll. rock is dead today. i haven't heard a decent true rock tune in several years now. its basically extinct to me. metal kinda lives on but, its time is coming soon as well. like all trends/fads, they come and go. most just go. git your money Beyonce, i think youll do well with this album for sures.
As a Texan since birth, I’ve NEVER BEEN HAPPIER!!!!!
Not country
This song reminds me of Kenny Rogers the gambler
Um no thank you.
When you run out of ideas for pop songs so you jump to country!!
Not a bad song, her voice sounds nice.
Poser country..
Dumbest video I’ve seen in awhile! Songs good, video…. Seriously lacking
Doesn’t she have a stylist or someone to tell her to put some clothes on?
Not to impressive.....stick to what your genra .....look like your trying to much
Hey Franklin
Nope, and dislike video as well
There are no words for how awful this is.
Not a fan of this song at all
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💅💅💅
Look at that torso.... I wouldn't pull out
What’s up with this video!
Really really sucks. Just gotta have the overt sexuality along with the crappy music and lyrics.
It's literally the Franklin theme song
This is so generic. Sounds like A.I. created "Country".. This woman is basically the 1% and knows absolutely nothing about country. This is the very definition of "Poser"...
Strip Club shit! 💩
She finally realized Taylor Swift couldn't be beat, so she decided to switch genre's. Taylor will make a country album now to lay the smackdown. K.O. coming
MA’AM! I looove this. I hope there’s room for me in the Hive? #ApplyingForHiveMembership
perfect and beautiful 😭😭😭
She ain't country... It's just a joke for her. Steal some awards, make a few million and she'll be gone.
This video is annoying as fuck.
Oh I triggered a Beyonce drone.. Get over yourself worker bee.. Beyonce is the very embodiment of an industry plant.. Garbage pop singer who appeals to simple minded drones..
😂Awful. Why do you have to be shirtless? Country don't work that way. 😅
Stupid
Is that Seven of Nine?
Wow!! This is definitely NOT country.
Haha Hey it’s Franklin 🐢 😂😂😂😂😂
I can hear the transition to the next song! She a genius! 😍❤❤❤
If eminem can be a rapper, Beyonce can be a country singer
Hey it's Franklin 🐢
So far the only country songs I like have POC in it lol
This freakin' sucks... She is as much country as Kenny G is a metal artist.. Beyonce is the biggest industry plant ever..
All my family is from Texas
That shit ain't country!!! Stay in your pop lane and keep getting you ass kicked by Taylor "I ain't country " Kelse!
You can afford the best song writers in the world and you come up with this shit, Jay please help your wife bruh...
Unfortunately she is "dressed" like a ho', the riff and the melody are cliché and you will notice the reference to the Illuminati one eye sign on her left eye. This is just a big commercial buzz, nothing is authentic! Country music has become a woke joke!
Garbage formulaic song with forgettable lyrics and music. So it definitely qualifies as country pop with all the other similar sounding garbage Nashville puts out. But country music is making money right now, she knows what she's doing.
That shit ain't county!!!! Stay in your lane!
Ai Sim!!! Reapresentou Demais No Country, Ficou Foda Demais. 🎶🪕🔥🇧🇷
So the video is "LOOK AT MY CLEAVAGE!"...🙄
Missssssssssssssszssssdssdzzzzzzszszssss kum n go
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great video love it
Country music or not… she did a good job with this song.. quite catchy..
This isn’t country music. This is a disgrace to real country.
This is so f stupid 😂
The only thing country about this song is the guitar and the word Texas.
She stole this beat from that turtle Franklin show lol
Even though we invented country girl put some clothes on. That guy jelly Roll to me has the best country song out, and it has a rock feel to it. I think it's called savior. Neither one of her songs compare to his
Just MAYBE these so called "artists" would actually compose NEW melodies instead of regurgitating old song compositions lol. But hey, they ALL do it. There's no such thing as original, that ship sailed forever ago.
If you really like country music - this is terrible. Trying way tooooooo hard.
What happened to the days when female pop/soul/country stars didn't have to dress like hookers to sell records? She's about as country as Xaviera Hollander.
i dont like country but this song is all over my fyp..  before u hate on my comment and stuff you can like what you like but this is the ONLY song i have been hearing for DAYS.
Es talento puro y ganar algo no la define
Se nota súper desesperada por ganar premios y como dijo el Ye1 " es que no entiendo por qué ella no se gana el premió a mejor álbum del año" avergonzando la!
It's honestly sounds truer to country song than 90 percent of popular country that just sounds like pop bad rock and bad rap music.
Who wrote this song though 🤔
This is an insult to country music. Is this considered a creative video? A half naked woman going up and down pretending to shoot at the air, over and over again. Once again an insult and a bad joke to country music and the artists who know and perform country music.
This ain't country.
She knew she didn’t have to dance in this video cause everyone else is dancing for her!
This is far from country 💯
I'm so sorry but this isn't country.  She should stick to what she knows
😅is this a joke. 🎉 clown 😂 your not country music.  Lil ma hip hop. 😅
She she filmed one 8 second scene and just played it over and over and over? I'm lost
it might grow on me but right now.....um
Hot garbage!!!
Meh
This is not good
🎉🎉
QUEEN
Trash 🗑️
I'm sorry I like some of her songs but she stole this song that was already made by a country singer so I'm so sorry this is not her song and she don't said good as she sings country but I still like her older songs and I am a hundred percent country fan but she would push me away it just don't sound good
Just in time for rodeo season 🤠
Love this, but why is she wearing one solarium eye goggle
AWFUL.....
Hey, It’s Franklin 😂
God awful song.  This isn't country.
😢 why do you have to be half naked and cuss all through the song! Ever heard of Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline? They were true country women stars.
Why did I stumble on this trash. She sucked before. More so now. Jesus what has this world came to. 😂
Boo just because beyonce has a song don’t make it a hit  Nike has cool shit I won’t buy it if it’s wack  Sit down lady.   You will never have album of the year unless you do your vodo.
Where is the country song 🤔 i didn't hear it.
Stagnant
This is not country music. Too much cussing sung in slutty clothes.
Sorry but not feeling this video!!  Especially with that hand gunfire!! Sadly this world is dealing with enough killing and shooting innocent people!!!!  Wack ASS VIDEO!!!!! 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I’m in luv with this choon. And even better it’s Beyoncé ❤x
Sit down  There is a reason you don’t have a # 1 album   Now country. Let jay z direct your music   You didn’t do justice for your no having album of the year.  This song will leave you alone with jay for the next awards
I don't get the hype.  Not a fan of the song and I love country music.  Beyonce is a good singer, but this misses the mark for me
terrible.
Franklin intro
As a Black native Tennessean, I've been a secret country music fan my entire life. 😊 Glad Beyonce has moved into the genre.
The worst 💩
As a Conway Twitty  and Loretta Lynn fan, I have to say that I really like this. It’s so much better than the crap that top 40 radio stations play,?  Great. She just made a fool out of most so called country artists.
Junk 😅😅😅
Is this an actual video?
She will never be country just has no clue on what it is two be country
I can actually appreciate her voice in this..
Hey it’s Franklin…. 🐢
Like Enyas remixes, she's upping country songs
Great R&B/hip hop singer and performer but not my type of "country". Good try though
Great choreography
HO down...apt
This goes soft
Only here because of the hey its Franklin reference😅
😂😂😂
Damn brilliant, Beyonce. Love it.
No country singer would dress this trashy lol😂 and this ain’t no freaking country song lol😂lol😂
Plz
This like a high schooler wrote and sang a song but since its her itll make millions really bland
Hey it’s frankliiinn
Double sided tape??  Very catchy song.  There are various choreographed line dances to it all over YouTube.
Moving on . . .  ain't no fan of this
This song sux
Video is stupid but the song is good! Catchy tune.
Why is she wearing nothing ??ridiculous
This doesn’t sound country at all
Ummm ……. It’s a NO for me.
Awful 😂😂😂
Ima be completely honest. This shit is a two pack of ass 👎🏽💩
Don't like what she's wearing not appropriate
I'm sorry queen b country is not your best music stick to yor regular music it's sounds better than your country
Nope.
This song and video SUCKS!
Terrible video!!!!!
OK, the video is tedious, but the sound has a little bit of Tracy Chapman, and plenty of attitude and sock. I just came over to check it out so that I could shut up some rednecks. Later.
Go head Beyonce. I love it
I think it sounds like country to me.  I didn't think Lil Nas's song old town road sounded country, though. Idk why people are saying this doesnt
What makes this country? The only thing country is the banjo in the background at times.😄
Catchy. I like it.
This is dumb. The lyrics suck ass. Dumb. Just dumb.
Country fans saying this is not country music, i guess its space music then 😂
This might get her closer to Taylor's popularity
For the amount of people saying this is not country music i am now tempted to listen some other country music in order to gain an opinion of my own 😅.
Do not sound good. Very terrible
Yeah this is the garbage that I thought it was going to be.
Small town talk is a real country music this is hip hop with country tone tone
“Come bring your (bitch) it’s a real hoe down”? Pathetic language.
Can't stand Beyonce but surprisingly this sing isn't bad
Love it but she could have done better if she would have dressed country
First off, you don't take a city slicker and make them country. Second, I'm a country boy and wouldn't give her the time of day. She says don't be a bitch in her song but it is written on her forehead. The only reason this is number one is because of her city slicker fans following her. She only gets the guys votes is because she damn neer showed them titties. GO BACK TO HIP-HOP. If this is country nowadays then I'm done.
This is unlike any country music video I have ever seen.  Where are her clothes?
Just a repeat video over and over again.  Men will love her breasts but doubt Ben is happy.  That’s his wife.  🙄
Trash
No
This song is so cringe. Not country at all
Wtf
Wow, she really had the braveness to dress up like that like you go girl work you ate the whole thing up
Why is she dress that way
I hope they don’t ruin real country, probably still the most honest music today
die blin* blinger bringen uns die Nacht vorbei in unseren einst Hauptschul-Gemeinden?! oh das war..aber wenn Ihr Sche*ss baut, seid Ihr selber darauf hereingeflogen mit?!
This song would’ve been good if Dolly sang it and changed a few lyrics. This has nothing to do with color so if anybody has the urge to pause on me that’s not this this is pulling a grasp at the younger country people and adding your little striptease and no talent in this video whatsoever and then also add your little robot shit unfortunate
I'm so in love 💕💕💕💕
Stupid song 🤣 and stupid video that ain't country
La canción es preciosa pero el vídeo aburridisimo
The harmonizing takes me back to Trio with Parton, Ronstadt & Harris.  Very lovely.
If she's such a great singer,  why must she depend on coming out naked to get attention for her "talent"?
Like the song but it's not country.
Lazy and classless! Sad that young girls and women see this as empowerment.
What a stupid video clip and the song is just stupid
Showing her versatility.   T Pain did as well.
I like the song but, can she put some clothes on and, be a little more modest.  Since when does country do porn?
Eh.. nothing special. Too much hype.
Just seeing her naked over and over again is really annoying. Nice song which i might not have heard otherwise.
Songs good video is crap.
yall are delusional and this song is trash. sounds like she ran out of ideas.
No. This is horrible. 🙄
Getto trash meets country.
Franklin Theme Song
The fact is on black history month. So historical❤
Wack... I thought it would be something original
Not country and a rip off of Kenny rogers
Damn!
Sorry not country music at all. Plus the classy country women of the past are above and beyond better than this. Unfortunately this is just trash. Keep country music pure and not rnb or pop sounding.
BEYONCE COUNTRY IS LIKE CARRIE UNDERWOOD RAPPING DONT MAKE NO SENSE.  😂
I guess i don't get the music video. Not her best work in my opinion, but everyone likes different things!
What an insult to even call this country. This is straight crap.
I always love Darius Rucker , K, Michelle,Charlie pride,Nelly,Beyoncé And don’t forget  RAY CHARLES and many more of US BLACK COUNTRY  Singers we Love them All keep pushing through country music is hard to get through the doors keep going ❤
y u k
😂
The song is great! Beyonce your voice sounds amazing, but what I really want to say.... WOMEN you don't need to be naked and show the world yourself. I think is time for women to start speaking up to this topic. If men where out there naked they would arrested,  women are seducing our men of today by exposing themselves, you don't need to be naked for anyone but yourself and if you are married which beyonce is. It is JC whom should see you naked not the world. We can hear your talent we don't need to see you in your skin!
Cultural appropriation
This sucks
I don't know about that outfit 🤔
She is cloned.
Sorry, but ain’t feeling it.  R&B is still her strength.  Her singing style just doesn’t fit.
Wtf us this? Another crap pop song labeled country
GROSS
Did she copy Franklin the turtle theme song?
❤❤🎉
How stupid is this video
Oh hell NO. Bad 🙄
I don't care for it.  Put some damn clothes on.
Needs more cowbell
Me too
Porn B or Queen B that is the question
Linda Martell  is the first black woman to make it on country charts 1969 song color him Father She also performed at the ole opry 12 times
As an older fan of Beyonce, this isn't anything like her classics, and it's NOT country, but I guess she can do EVERYTHING
Cool song
Thanks for bringing porn back to female country
I gotta admit my country ass was jammin while chucking hay when I heard this. The music video screams Terminator had a baby with Blazing Saddles and starred in a cheap p*rno.  I'm sorry. That would never fly on the farm.
Maybe we can play Texas hold em, probably my favorite card game, I love figuring out probabilities
It's an ok Song, but why she's gotta be almost  Naked all the Damn time..video idea is not good, 🤔
Horrible outfit. Less be alittle modest yours a mother and wife in your 40s.
S U C K S
I don't like it , she s not a country singer !
Don’t tell me  By Madonna ❤
0:11 pew pew 🔫
forever the QUEEN!! 👑
County?😂more like clowning country 😂
This isnt country music.  I do think that Beyonce is talented however....
This ain't no dam country music wtf
The openig reminded me of Jolene by Dolly Parton. a song I think it would be great for Beyonce to cover
Hey it’s Franklin she’s the devil 🤮
I'm sorry  but she fucked up contry song also she is not made for this
That's all she does the whole time ???????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂boooooooooringgggggg
It's a wrap 🎉
She had to change her genre to try and win album of the year she can't with the competition...
I've always loved country but anyway.....
This has to be the stupidest video I’ve ever seen
She really went all out for the video....
Disgraceful, at best.
Garbage 🔥 this really sucks.
A lame video..I expected better!
Only Beyoncé could take country which is classy and turn it in to the ghetto seriously with the cuss words and the trashy outfit come on keep country classy
Yea a real ho down u dressed like one wtf ppl dressing like this nothing but gross IDC how pretty you are have some respect for your self
Holly cow haodiii😮❤
Country music just keeps getting worse and worse.
Wonder what she always has to be naked… poor girl
What is this crap
She is nasty
All I have to say is bey cold blooded
Oh geeze, just no. And the video is just as ridiculous. Why is it number 1 anywhere?
This is NOT country. This is a joke.
This is terrible and quite embarrassing for the country music community.
this shit ass
This video is so dumb.
Suddenly I like country music
The song is fun, but the video sucks big time. She looks amazing but the video is mehhhh. I have more fun watching people dancing on TikTok. It would be nice to see Beyoncé line dancing
She actually makes country music sound good
FYI she made this song and cd 3 years ago we just nowing getting it.. real fans haveing been waiitng and wanting this for years.. this will be biggest moment yet.. she not new to this she been that girl!! 👑📍🎉🙌😍🤑💯
I dont know,  but there's something about looking like a stripper and country music that dont mix. And "bitch"???
🫶🏼💋💄🫦🦻🏻💃🏻♥️🫶🏼♥️🫶🏼👀♥️🫶🏼🙌🏻🫶🏼
*I love it!* Long time country music fan here and I love it! Reminds me of some of the country I loved in the 1970s (yes, I am only 5 minutes younger than dirt) and yet it's also as fresh as tomorrow. I want more, more, more!
Number 1 in the UK🎉🎉🎉. How the hell are these young girls going to become Icons. This chick can’t be dethroned 😂
song fucking sucks ! You cant just become country overnight, doesn't matter if she was born and raised in Houston, doesn't make her country. Country is a lifestyle, not something you just decide to make an album on to capitalize off the genre because she's so bored with her own style of music, next!
Lord Have Mercy please put on some clothes!
Texas Hoeing you know the Rake😂😂and the meaning
This song is shit, you are all delusional.
"Hey it's Franklin"
We needed more sleez in country music
THIS SONG SUCKS IT DOESN'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT MAMA OR PRISON OR TRUCKS. OR TRAINS OR GETTING DRUNK. Legs are nice.
Beyoncé should redo the Forester Sisters song “Men”….that would be FIRE
This isn’t country music
She’s overrated. She’s better at R&B. This is not it. People support her only cause she is black and it’s country. Not cause it’s a good song. That’s America tho. lol.
Horrible!!!!!!! cuz it’s Beyoncé y’all gone butt kiss y’all not this some dumb ish get it together she just running out that’s it that’s all is not a good song at all
As the video shows, this is just her regular music pretending to be country.  Proving once again, that the masses are stupid.  Not only will they believe anything you tell them, but they'll also like it if you say it's good.  This ain't even mid.  It's honestly pretty terrible and blasé.
Loved Daddys Lessons!! My fave song for years...don't care for this. And visualizer??....it's just her rubbing up her breast 😔
Not country. It's pop with a twang, just like today's country. Won't go out of my way to listen to today's country, including this song. Not impressed.
Taylor left country music so Bey came to claim it.
this is not country! im sorry
Okay for the record that is not a country song and she's half naked. Country isn't about being a half naked pop star.
Not impressed. Doesn't sound country and the lack of clothing doesn't have anything to do with the song.  Once your a parent it's okay to be sexy,however, show your kids some respect.
I kinda like this song i don’t care if it’s country or pop or something in the middle
FODA PACARALEOOO
what the whole fck is this? ROFL. This video is trash asf. Where is Bey? They cloned her, huh?  She can't break the internet like she used to.
Sucks
No thank you .
what a disgrace to country music
This is not Beyonce
🤠🤠🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼
Not sure why people are saying this is a country song. It's not bad, but definitely not country.
This song sucks. She is no Mickey Guyton
Feísimo 🤭
I have to honestly say she completely messed this song up!
It's catchy but this is BARELY country. Like...this is only country because you said it is. Barely has lyrics. It's really boring. Catchy, but don't go trying to make it something more than it is.
This doesn't sound good. I'm worrying if people are just deciding to praise anything she releases. This is no Renaissance.
Whiteappropriation
I’m a country music fan as well. Those songs get me stirred up. Congratulations Queen B!
Sorry NOT country
you know, all I can see it's just another BS ..this is not a real country song, its nothing sound like that...P.S. she should stay on her line, don't mix with others...not working...
She knows to how unite a divided nation 😂🇺🇸
Hot Damn!!!❤❤❤❤
Lot of trust with that top
This is garbage. Sloppy, cliché nonsense.
🤮🤮🤮
🚮
Did I miss a video?  Or is it really the exact same move over and over and over again?
She needs to just retire with her husband
The music video itself is boring cuz they just keeping showing the same thing over and over again with her blowing the smoke from the gun.
No.
This is not country music sorry but ain’t.
This song sucks
As a colored person, it aint country
Basically if Swifty can go from Country to Pop, Beyonce is not going to be upstage so she's going pop to country.
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now been streamed over 50 million times on Spotify! Her fastest song to reach this milestone! 👑🐝
The video shit though...😂
Love this song ❤
This isn’t country. The voice is all wrong, just because u sing a country song doesn’t mean you CAN sing country. It’s totally Karaoke. I’m an old country fan. I don’t listen to but 1% of new stuff and this is not country. Don’t be a bitch😂 she’s even using pop words 😂😂 fail
Really creative video😂😂
who told her this was the route to take. yikes
Make better than her degrading "Bow Down"!!!
Where is your shirt
LOVE!
Rather see her do rock music over country.
This is not country. She needs to stay in her genre of music. She has a beautiful voice but this does not fit in the country music world...
You just knew it wasn’t gonna be anything like country when you saw ‘Texas Hold Em’ 😂
Is she just doing this to make a big impact and be talked about?
This costume is so tacky... Where did the classy Betonce go
Absolutely one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard especially if it’s country because it doesn’t sound country at all and the only reason her song is so high up there is because she’s literally half naked running around like a big old S and that’s why it’s at the top of the country charts and everything else she’s a great singer for sure. She could probably sing a country song, but this ain’t it. That song was not very good.
This song is whack!
Beyoncé, I am seriously disappointed in this video. I mean seriously, for all the hype and the fussing that people have made over this song, I fully expected to see you do something more than just walk seductively toward the camera, slide your finger up the front of yourself and point your finger like you are shooting a gun with a little sparkle. You really did NOT need to show her breasts like you did either, it did NOT add anything to this video. You would have been much better off demonstrating the "Texas Hold 'Em" Line Dance that you inspired. Now that would have been MUCH MORE SEXY. I am not a Lesbian, but I am sure that people who are gay would have enjoyed watching you all the more. Really Beyoncé, I know you can be more creative than this! Come on girl, get your act together and show everybody the dance that you want to inspire and KNOCK OFF THE STUPID CUSSING IN YOUR SONGS, you don't need that in any of your songs. Our children need better role models than that. Plus, dancing is an absolutely marvelous way to stay in shape. I strongly encourage you to remake this video and be the best role model you possibly can be for EVERYBODY that you inspire.
Isn't this the Franklin song just with different words?
Lmfao!!😂😂
LMFAO!!!!! 😂🤣😂
If you guys wanna check out some ACTUAL country - check out Sierra Ferrell because I don’t know what this is. Stay in your lane Beyoncé 😂
This song is a lot of things.. a country song ain't one of em!
stick to R&B this is trash
This song has already been wr
Heeeeehaw❤❤❤❤
This is not giving
Porn more than a song.
Boring
Nope!
Go Bey!!!!! It ain't nothing she can't do
Not Country 😢!  Never been a fan and still not! She needs to go put some clothes on. 😢
Beyonce .... Finally something worth listening too coming from her .... always hated her music !!! Candace Owens , you wrong on this one ! think i can finally grow on her now
Almost country not quite
What cowboy pulls up in a Lexus? 🤷
So y’all know she stole this from Franklin the Turtle right?? Maybe not the lyrics but the beat for sure
This is so cringe
Cunt-ry now? Stay in your lane. This shit sucks.
Uuuuuuuuuu Lov it Lov it Lov it summer is coming ❤
There ain't no basements here! Tf? 😂😂😂😂😂
Trash 😂😂😂
So you can't put any ol' lyrics to a country beat and call it country music! I see why the Country community is appalled!
It’s a stupid song. It’s alright for another different genre. But definitely not country  😂😅
Looks like a washed-out Only Fans performer trying to sing country.
Not country music.just ewww.
YT folk hate it! 😂😂😂😂 Yeah we here too fool.... Yee haw!!!🎉
I don’t get this video. Just because you have a nice body doesn’t mean you need to dress like a hoedown 😂.
Rihanna’s version was better and it disappeared :(
This best thing about this song is Beyonce showing her cleavage.
Love it!
So we can’t see the whole video for free 👍 very Beyoncé 💖 guess I’ll never see it ✌️ like da song tho
Spot the difference .. the adult version.
It’s an embarrassment to country music.
I respect her art, I respect her talent. But this is not country music. This is a really good pop song.
Even though this isn't country like I grew up listening to, I'm here for it it if it means Queen B breaking records and being the first black women to top country charts!! Keep pushing boundaries, B!!!
What a crap song
Not a fan! More Pop Music sound, not close to being Country music!
Put some clothes on. Country is classy.
This is garbage
More like can  That Outfit Hold Em
Terrible
why. don't. I. like. this. i like country but this just generic maybe?
Now she's making visualizer videos who doesn't even show up much in talk show when she don't need us 😂😂and trying country why..??i think i know
Ok. I watched the video. It’s the same thing over and over
Pretty good song, but adding a banjo does not make it a country song tho.
She is a bit old to be dressed like that!
This is garbage and not country
Hey, my playlist changed 2024
I love country music and glad Queen Bey made an album
too corny😂😂😂😂
Texas
The video is the best with the volume on zero!!!
Reminds me of her old stuff
Country fans *eyerolls knowing country music has been the best since forever
Not a fan of this new song. I enjoy her music but occasionally there is a disconnect for me and this is a new one.
🔥
So many finger guns.....
This song is terrible 😂😂😂
Narcissism  Overview  Treatments  Main Results  Description  Personality qualities include thinking very highly of oneself, needing admiration, believing others are inferior, and lacking empathy for others.
That video sure looks like it took a hell of a lot of effort!! Still doesn’t make me like Beyoncé!!
That is really her.❤❤😂🎉😂❤😂🎉.
She killed,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Trash!!   Always gotta be showing butt or boobs 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤣😂only way to get views !!!   SHE is wayyyyy overrated
This video is horrible Why bother with clothes at all smh
Beyonce has always been a brilliant artist that blended pop and country well before now. I am upset at her clothing.  We are now in a time when men are constantly prosecuted and losing their careers for considering women sexual objects.  I think it is incredibly unfair to men to see this and not think of her as a sexual being first.  She should have been totally clothed so her music would have stood on its own merit.
She is somebody's mother. Does she still need that in 2024 ?
Sounds like she’s making fun of Country Music…
This song sucks this ain’t no country disrespect and disgusting
This aint country😂😂😂😂
The song is catchy, it's good. I would have liked more of a county outfit, at least some western boots and hat.
Trash. Lol😂
Que voz tan increíble 🎉 pero vídeo ...osea se muestra vulgar y cero creativo 🤔 será bajo presupuesto 😅
Stupidest song ever if you’re talking about how you’re not in Texas and park your Lexus why are you attempting a country song this song is garbage and stupid
uhhhh NO!
Queen!
This sucks. I can’t even listen to the whole thing
this shit is trash. leave it to the white people. and black peeps get mad when white people try to do rap or act like a wigga. god this girl is bored to make this
The sad part is she is not good 😂😂😂
THIS IS FRANKLIN THEME SONG 😂😂😂
WTF wrong on some levels !!!! Stick to pop
Hey it's Franklin!!!!
BootBarn stock $$$
Not even close to being country
Of course shes doing the one eye illuminati thing 😂😂😂. Illuminati queen
Beyoncé country? Hmm 🧐 probably not here best song like the beat, but she ain't no luke combs
Just hecause she sings about Texas doesn't make this a country song, sorry, was this done because Tracy Champman appeared on the country charts with the rerelease of Fast Car?
She's NOT COUNTRY!!! She's a wanna be!!! She's jealous of Country!
Now I'm a pure ole fashion country music fan but this ain't half bad ......
Imo the songs ok, but it's definitely not country
Sorry but me no like 🤡
Disgusting video, we country girls don't dress like that.
why is she naked :/
Not sure about doing country music half naked .. something off about it
not a fan of new pop country at all but im ok with this.
I love country ❤
This is repetitive and boring.
Country singers are not half naked put some decent cloths on
I like her r&b better but I get she made a song for her state
Song is ridiculous  and video is the stupidest thing I've ever seen
There is nothing about this that is country music related. Walk into a bar.  Ride a horse. Do something other than just walk up to screen.
I like the song, but the video is lame. It's the same thing just being repeated.
I gave it a shot. Do not care for it, not for me. I like country but I think it's her voice that I don't like.
I dont like the song . Hmm bad song
Put some more clothes on !
The music is country, but her voice is not country enough.
I can`t walk out because I love you too much baby  😀
This aint country 😂
What is this?
Maybe Beyonce should go country it fits her
Jay: im telling you B, you can write the stupidiest shit you can think of and those dummies will buy and listen to it  Beyonce: oh you were right Jay, 😆
Okay song, but nothing great. The video's a bore.
Now country music is sex and naked to... goodbye to the days of the Lord and good old beautiful love songs, filth has come to country.  Thanks Beyonce for being the first to shame the genre.
Looking good for over 40 years old. No doubt some touchups, but still..
I don't like it! I don't like the outfit, the music, this is garbage. There are some great Black American country music artist out...this is not one of them. Check them out.
Wth is that get up she has on? Not to mention their corny song.
THIS IS WHACK STICK TO THE POP HIP-HOP SHIT 🤣🤣🤣😂😂🙀👎👎
A great outfit for a Mother with young impressionable Children  huh ? . 😮 😢 Seams like it don't fit the song. Her voice is Beautiful.
I WATCH GUNSMOKE, BUT THIS IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION.
Cover up!! Yikes
This is awful
I feel like this song is good and it’s different I like it but I feel like the video should’ve been more
NOPE! NO GOOD! A child could have wrote this simple brained melody.
This is how it all could be, wouldn't that be the real america? Wouldn't y'all want just that energy? 🤝
Elvis was a descendant of Melungeon's black-and-white community
This is still like R n B slow tempo, still catchy. Doesn't sound like a country song.
Ne s’est pas donner de mal pour le clip …. Déçue
Musik super 👍 Video beschissen 👎
I might do a country song self just to honor my ancestors who created it...Country music belongs to Black people and I love it.
Well ,it’s not bad .
Mmm just because it had a country vibe it doesn’t mean it is country. Not my cup of tea
Awful
She needs to stay in her lane. This is like a farce of a country song.  Had to be scantily clad to get any attention bc this song sucks
this sucks
There are certain artists that no matter what crap they release and people this is crap, their fans will purchase or call it a masterpiece. Come on are fans really that tone deaf??? There's a reason she's half naked, and that's to distract her fans from the bad music.
I’m with the song, but why the hell is this her attire? B you were supposed to kill the dance moves with this song like we know you could.
maybe honey
masonic eye
Don’t know what they hype is about this
Music is nice, but why she has to get almost naked, and trashy looking
Can’t wait to see her on stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville!! 🎉
Trash
Women in country music have more class then this,why the trashy outfit if she thought she could sell a country song with her voice!
Don't care for it at all.. I love her usually, but this SUCKS.
Not real country sounds like her pop music
Put some clothes on why be half naked its getting old and shes getting old time to get some real class
She's no Dolly or Tammy
Wow!  You know that when we as Black People get our hands on something, we put a LOT of soul into it!!  Beyonce is an amazing musical artist!
And country has gone to hell. Grant it still have people like Riley Greene who still are somewhat country but besides the very few like him country is more hip hop than country
Trashy woman.
Lmao, this sounds like she's making a parody of a country song. And her stupid cowboy outfits look like she bought a costume from Spirit on half price day. It's not that a black woman can't make country, who cares about her race ( literally no one) its that she comes off more like she is making fun of country music than appreciating country music. I wouldn't expect any less from one of the most arrogant performers in a business full of arrogant people, probably the only one more arrogant is JayZ
😍😍😍😍😍
This trash 🗑 isn't country🤮....bye 🖐
Shit song.
Total CRAP!!!
This is a disgrace to Country Music. This world has lost all their morals.😢😢😢
There she goes already with her baphomet hands sign, anyone giving her the time of day needs to have a spiritual awakening to the one and only true God Jehovah
I am so sad my babies have to grow up in this world.
Complete trash. Not only the song but especially the singer.
How sad she has to show them ta ta's. Unnecessary and bad influence for kids Really not a great song but I guess she needs the cash.
What is she (not) wearing? She has the greatest voice, why'd you have to go cheap??!
Awesome song and so many singer's are underestimated in so many ways but, at least dress with class. I don't care who you are. People know you for your talent and you don't have to show yourself physically to anyone.
that jacket is saving ur life
Is it just me or the video is just 10 seconds going on and on and on all the same 🤔
Hey this is Franklin… lol…. Can any one day copy right infringement 😂😂😂👀
Booooring..
What the hell is this she isn’t country what a disgrace
When was this written? When did it come out? I’ve heard this before this isn’t new.
That's the problem great song why you gotta dress like that my child I let listen country but never this song. Come on B cover up.
Reinota !!
😮😮😮 Wow
This ain’t country 😂 🤮
Whoever wrote this song had a "country music phrase" dictionary  LOL   She forgot to put the word "truck" in the song but maybe that has been replaced with "Lexus"
Hate it what is she wearing this is not country stick to r and b
Not really country sound. More of pop.
This sound like franklin the turtle's song👀
She is a BEAUTIFUL Woman but PLEASE put some Clothes On…..My God do We have to see almost Everything…… I’m not a Country Music Fan at ALL….I have NEVER bought 1 Country Song 🎵 and still Will NEVER….. I have Never Bought Her Music 🎶 Music Today is HORRIBLE just my Opinion…..
Pretty much no clothes, no dancing, singing, walking, shooting a fake gun.......yup it is amazing when you have the right name you can do anything!  I did not like it, and I dont see her as country artist in any way . She would never fit in with those down home people. She is too Beyonce.
I don't understand the video
So, I had to check out this new 'music video's of hers because I keep hearing about it. It's not your regular music video. It's pretty lazy. In fact, it's simply the same clip of her on repeat for the whole song. Sorta weird.
The songs alright but the video.... Was this 30 seconds and just put on repeat? Extremely lazy.
Holy shit.
Beyonce Madonna and Lady Gaga all did their stint in country. This ain't nothing new
Put some damn clothes on!  Why be half naked to sing a song.  The song is fine - get some clothes!
Awful. She's capable of making good music, but this is far from that
ghetto
weak
noise
This is not a country song
Gretchen Wilson gonna want some royalties.
Ha ha
Pretty good song.  Terrible video.
A pretty lazy video if we're being honest.
Lord No😏
This song is garbage.
This song is garbage.
I've heard better
This is the worst thing I have ever heard in my life.
Good song. Needs to be more creative with this video(not exactly Nashville)..
Selling sex appeal more than music
This is the video. I don’t like it at all. She could of wear a T boots and jeans   She could of dance like she knows how. Don’t like the song or video. 👎👎
Just people hating here pure poison aff
Nah , it’s not for me . Hear so much about this song ! Was looking forward to seeing the video ! Wow was let down !
Garbage
This is so bad
Love the song, hate the video
She really trust this jacket 😅
baphomet lookin obvious these days.
This has to be a joke. This is what happens when people with no talent at all are given too much money. This better not be put on country radio!
It’s dope bc it’s R&B with a country kick and a sprinkle of gospel influence 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 it’s not completely country bc dat music is wack 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omg wait I was coming here to hear what all the fuss was … loved country music grew up on it bc of my dad. And this song is catchyyyyy. Love it. And I’m not going to lie I thought it was going to be trash lol.
This is horrible and not country at all. Nice try though
what an embarassment to actual country music. Nothing about this song represents country music.
I like it. It's different. And atleast her hair isn't blowing in the fake wind  anymore. Go Bey!
Great song. A real country video would go great with it.
What a joke complete lack of real country talent
not a fan of her outfit or the song
Well I’ve heard country an this ain’t it shes sounds like all the new pop country bs artist this is shit
The outfit absolutely doesn't fit that song. She had been dressed better.
Heyyyy it's Franklin
All that money with No Class. Terrible role model for our young women.. This ain't Country y'all.
This video and song are just awful
Country?  Really???
Dit is toch verschrikkelijk!! Dit is GEEN country en zal het ook nooit worden 😢😢
She can't beat Taylor so she goes country lol
❤❤❤love it
count me in with being a fan of hers;  she made another song I liked that to me sounded country-ish.   Called Daddy Lessons.   As far as this video , I don't care for it.   Song is ok and I won't pick on what she is or isn't wearing but there is no creativity in the video , just her being shown doing the same thing over & over.   Doesn't hold my interest at all.  The woman can dance but I don't get this.
🗑️
This is trash😂
Nice❤
I hope someday she will record a video clip completely naked
I don't like it, it doesn't fit her n it doesn't fit country music.
There is only ONE reason this experiment for her is working and one reason only…but from a musically realistic standpoint, there is nothing special about this song!  🤷🏼‍♂️
at least the depth of the song is matched by the looped video lmao. litterraly the perfect example of you can't sing it if you don't live it AT ALL.
straight up ass
This is terrible. Hope her husband can by Album of the Year with it? No way!
No.
This sound more like a hymn then country
Not country
Sux
She's beautiful but the song is hot garbage
Trash
The outfit gives vibes of bedroom roleplay. 👀
Umm, cool song boring video
I don't think I've ever been addicted to a country song until now . . .
Damn stay in your own lane this aint country. Your just another one of the fame grabbers trying country. Beyonce hasnt been shit in years. She needs to dissappear. I think its funny it only has 7 million views. While independent artist put out music thats getting 7 million views in 2 days but the industry doesnt want you to see them. Because this stupid shit keeps people complacent.
That's the best video/choreography they could come up with for this video?
This song is trash i love country music.. but this doesn’t have a country voice like nooo!!! I don’t care who is a fan This ain’t it..
This video doesn't fit the hype of this song
Not good at all!  That's not country.  Sorry but she is not a country singer.
More one eye symbolism
It's call versatile, was never a fan until now. It's says black people breathe life into anything.  John schneider go suck a lollipop 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Why foul language? That's not country bringing the hood into country music, Can't we keep anything clean?
NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING COUNTRY 🤣🤣🤣🤣 A sampled banjo 🪕 does not make a country song. A pig with lipstick 💄 is still a PIG 😂
Estamos esperando el video real
No sé, pero debería hacer un video nuevo haciendo el challenge viral siento que se desperdio mucho con tanto material. Con la mitad de ambos se hace un bueno.
🎵Hey it's franklin🎵
I never heard this kind of music I don't remember it
Like Queen Bey's pop and R&B, I think I might love her country!!  A really good one!!  Still soulful to my ears!  Fun!
Nice Song❤
This is wretched
omg   beyonce  needs to stick to her songs.  stay out of country music , this is not for you!!!!  horrible song!  leave country music to the real country music artist.  no more country beyonce   you are doing it an injustice
Okay well,  I guess that passes for country. I liked it.
Disgusting. She can't even sing country
This song and video is 🗑.. if any white person sang this yall 🥷 would say turn that shit off, but it's Beyonce. Followers 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Lmmfao sounds like SHIT.......
Wow ❤
No need to dress so revealing anymore.
Country music best music in the world
Sounds like Franklin"s theme song to me :)
Terrible song 👎🏽 sorry beyonce
please wear nice clothes sister 😢
I shit my pants everytime i hear this song cuz it makes my tummy hurt.
There are a lot of black southerners that have always listened to country before Beyoncé it was just never talked about.
Flashbacks from Franklin Theme song 😂
This is horrible song is trash. The video is garbage. She looks like an arrest that just coming out not much talent so she is selling herself to sell albums. She is at a point in her career where she does not need to do this.  This is a bad look for Beyoncé.
It sucks lmao it’s nothing close to country at all !
The song is catchy although #1 seems a real stretch. They must have spent 30 minutes working on the video.
You stole this song from a turtle 🐢 😂
Beyreal  creative girl one❤v from Jamaica 🇯🇲
This is called "Nashville" music. "Country" left Nashville a long time ago. The way it has been trending, this was a foreseeable conclusion. Not to say there is no longer any good music in Nashville, it is just very seldom country music. Fortunately, one can still find good country music if you know where to look. Just don't expect to find it on Nashville radio. Congrats
I like a lot of her music . I love country music I don't care for this
Not country....porn more like it...she DEFINITELY DIDN'T use her ACTUAL TALENT
This ain't country music. Took a traditional country/gospel beat and threw in some banjos. Tbe attire speaks volumes, and just because she from Houston doesn't make her or this song country by any means. Just manufactured pop with country rythem and beat. Jus' sayin.
Now go put some cloths on and stop selling your music with your body exposed.  I don't care how many views she had, who is not going to look she's naked.
This is not country music. It's barely music, just for people who won't admit she's not "all that"... Geez...
Shes not putting in any effort maybe she doesn't want to spend the money?? In case it doesn't work out?   I do like Beyonce she looks beautiful. It country put on clothes... i know you guys hate that i said it...
Beyoncé you NEED to thank Mickey Guyton, Tiara Kennedy, The War and The Treaty, Charley Pride, and the like for even being able to put this song out. Charley Pride & Mickey Guyton have been country music staples LONG before now.. Since your husband felt the need to call the Grammy’s out DESPITE your whopping 32 Grammys, I’m feeling the need to call you out. Hell, you also need to thank Lil Nas X.. without ANY of these artists, you’d be a wandering ghost making your best attempt at country music, at the moment. I’m a fan of your other music, but credit is due where credit is due. You owe those who went thru the help of breaking some barriers, BEFORE this song was ever even a thought, some serious credit. Hell, Mickey Guyton should be YOUR country music idol!
This not country😂😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
it's not country
Well it DOES sound like TODAY'S country so maybe im wrong.
🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ black lady that like certain country. Where’s the deep message that’s normally embedded in country? This is more pop to me but hey if it worked 😂😂😂
Its alright.... its beyonce so its going to be good but its just not country to me.
Boring song but nice body
the outfit show to much but the song is sooooooooo good
Horrible video but love the song
Please NEVER do this shit again
WTF! 🤢
''Don't be a bitch''? We need to stop normalizing things like calling guys female, or also calling people gay for another example as insults.  Being female, and also being gay is not an insult because they are equal to the rest of us...   #EqualityMovement #EmpathyRevolution #SomosUno
You got to be kidding!! LOL 😂
Its pop with country stuff being used to make it seem country like ho down, texas, poker etc
More Folk/prog then Country. Texans have a weird since of country music.
I can’t even get through the song because of how trashy this video is. Does she know country artists generally wear clothes?
I dont get the hype on this song ya'll
What a jam ❤
This reminds of the opening music the kids show Franklin!!
This song absolutely sucks l,all she is doing is showing her breast!I love her other songs
This sucks, definitely not country.
Te amo Bey <3 <3
WOW, I expected SO much better. Lame song, lame video. No wonder no real country artists are taking her seriously.
Murder on country music Row replaced with pop music.
That stinks geese!!
That is not country
Se ela gravar piseiro ou brega funk vira hit! ❤
Wtf that’s franklins theme song
Put some clothes on lady!
Couldn’t finish watching 😂. Ridiculous!
Big 🍔
How could she forget her shirt?
That video is a joke
Don’t like her music never did . It’s the skin that sells . The music is mediocre and always has been. That’s pop, not country
Will there  be a music video?
Let me just say, I like the storyline and her  country change…however, country music for women is not meant to be sexualized like this video.  Beyoncé, be yourself like you would at home and make this song what you really want it to be. Time and place for sexualizing a song and I just don’t feel country music is one of them.   Keep making the shift in the music industry and making history. ❤️
What to your shirt?😢
This isn’t country…it is FIRE! Love and support anything she does because she does it like a BOSS!
Every thing now for U, BS here Not your best Beyoncé
Hey Bey.... You ripped off Franklin 🖕 You're not country.
You just need to not be white or straight and there you go! ;)
Worthless.
What is the point of looping the same video? Is there an artistic message I’m missing? Honestly love B but this felt like a porn gif on repeat
country music has a message ... this is just dance beats
❤❤🔥🔥🐝🐝🐝
Outfit nope you have a body but nope and the song is alright but boring doing the same thing to much walk shooting a make believe gun nope
Gross. A putrid infection of a genre.
omg horrible this isn't country
This isn’t even country ffs
She really doesn't have the voice for country to be honest, stick to what ya know Beyoncé stop trying to be Taylor swift.
This isn’t true country music  and is a poor music video and she should stay in her style of music
I wonder which County musician she stole this song from?
What’s up with this video
Clothes would have been a nice choice!  Not a fan of
Nope
@beyonce now do a remix with Miley Cyrus!!!!
Ok. Well country music wasn't invented by black people and no it wasn't based off the blues.
What's with the plastic wrap on her eye? Why do we have to see her cleavage?
Not a but the Black sex Goddess Outlaw
Pure trash
Of course she has to be half naked.
Dumb, it's porn
This song is trash. Sorry for the folks that like it.
Wtf does her being half naked have anything to do with this song? Can u say needing attention much, this is absolutely horrible
Makes me wanna dance 😂👏❤️
This ain’t no video. I am tired of her not doing videos.And K Michelle been country.
This trash is not country
🤦‍♀️ why does she have to be half naked? Seriously  Nice melody, but the lyrics aint
Wackkkkk
This is in NO way country & it just goes to show what people will do to try to get even more famous!!!
Cowboys who hate guns would like this
🐢
What does she even talking about in the song is she talking about all the black on black crime and blame it on the white people and how white people take Grammys from her. Blaming everybody
Love her voice but wasn't feeling the country twang to it!
May be R&B fan but I'm fully country fan now. It's 2024.🫶
der song is gut das video is kacke
The song is great! But why cursing? Don't hear that in country songs. Video is gross.
Wait..there are pirates in country  now? Woow. Fembot
Could she have any more clothes on?!?! 😂
Trash
This is exactly what I thought it was! She's being used to bring live sexual images on screen in front of young people who are watching these videos & parents don't realize it. Make sure you know what they are seeing & doing on line. There sure isn't any talent here when the music track belongs to another artist & the screen of her walking up & shooting just plays over & over again. She's not sincere...she just promoting sexual depravity! Satin worshipers all these elite idiots! GO look up they're real agenda & signed & symvalizum.
How is this country?
It's a good pop song. Pop....pop
Dog ?
This is the Franklin theme song lol
Why is this video 8 hours long
Please stick to R&B please please. Oh God This Is Bad. Leave this to Charlie Pride or Darin Ruckus
I love country music & this not IT!!!!!
Ok Franklin 🤣🤣
Go girl
I'm made a song saying saving like the rennasance meaning saving through art pieces probably the way I meant it
Country is classy and this video is he opposite:(
Well I'm not a big fan of this song at all...
Sucks.
smh
This song is GAWD awful!!!!
This song is BULLLLLLLLSHIIIIIIIIITTTTTT
Gastaron mucho para  la producción del video.😅😅
Beyonce got a body
tijd voor thee met een koekie man man man kanslooswijf bah
This sounds like she wanted to prove how stupid country fans are and put out nonsense with a good beat.  The lyrics are garbage.
Nothin country here. Pitiful
so....white people can wear Dredds now??????
Mam nadzieje że nie boli ją bardzo glowa bo po tym stroju mam koszmary
Love the song! No money for a video? On a constant loop...sad.
Maravilhosa como sempre mamis!! yaahoo!!!  🐎🐎🐴🐴
Need some Valarie June collabs ❤
Trash
Wow!!! Am shocked how good this is
Erotica comes to country …. Is nothing precious?
Terrible song
HABLA BEEEE!!!!!! TÁ TEU NOMEEEE
in this music video the best are tits
keep country country and  porn porn
This isn't even pop country, lol. She sounds good as always.
No
Her husband makes a fit and then she turns county?? She doesn’t seem to like it…..
Sounds like most of the country music today……. Not Good.
Beautiful but costume is a minus.
The visualizer is just a baphomet pose on repeat with the one eye symbolism
Yup, sucks as much as I thought it would
You ain't no country singer Beyonce
Its good but not even country
Not country..... Not enough attention in the world for people like her. 🤢
Beyoncé is good but this is bad . Sorry y’all
Not country lol
This sucks!!! Video is garbage also 👎🏼
This is proganda country music that the democratic party is using trying persuade rual republican voters to vote democratic.  Dont fall this. All of a sudden a well known democratic who was for Obama now coming out with country music in an election year. Rual America do not fall for this. This are using her and Taylor Swift to help win the election this year.
зовсім не відношу себе до фанатів кантрі музики, але буде цікаво послухати робити Бьйонсе)
This isn’t country…. Just because there’s cowbell doesn’t make it country! I NEED MORE COWBELL!   However it would make sense and be a positive movement for our entire country if more people followed her (other than the half naked part) and became farmers and homesteaders. That’s how communities take care of each other. That’s how our country survives.
Really?
Boring video
🤠🔥🔥🎤
❤❤❤❤ bout to go get me some cowboy 🤠 boots and hat !!💯💯
AI's version of country music using DEI.
Wait WF is she wearing 😂
Beyonce needs to stay in her own lane looking trashy can't even dance and her pew pew sucks to cheap video not impressed
She nails every song she sings! ❤❤❤❤
Brasil
I don't like the country but because of Queen Bey I like it whaouuu❤
She should have cowgirls and cowboys like the southern soul singer Jeter Jones
Corrupting Country music now, Wow.
sucks
This could have been good if it weren't for the dumb, trashy lyrics.
What the heck, why are you half naked singing a country song?? Shameful!! Be aware in case you are not , kids are watching this video too. What’s the purpose, I am appalled.
Not country
Stupid!😂
Crappy, boring, anthemic. Ugly ass costume. So dumb.
🔥2024!!!!
Anyone missed the one eye agenda. Lol. Either way she should just do strip dancing from now
So when she in the black community, she sings on division. But in the white community she talks about fun and unity. lmao
Can’t believe the blatant cultural appropriation smh
Song not bad but the video outfit doesn’t go well with the song.
Do not like this.
This video is stupid
A #HIT. 🎯 🔥🔊🔥🔊🔥
Crap song. Sounds like it was written by AI.
Stupid video
This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen
Nope.
Nawww. Too much like R n B trying to be country
Queeeeeeeennnnn
❤❤❤
THAT'S THE WHOLE VIDEO????
NO NO NO! And Girl button your shirt up. This only hit the top because JZ paid up!
Amoooooooo
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This isn't country just because you change the  instruments you still sound pop to me go back to it
Not country and garbage
Country needs to thank Beyonce to place it in a new spotlight.. 😇
Why is she almost completely naked? There is no need for it…
This is terrible but not unexpected 😂😂😂
When the  sensual goes vulgar. Sad😢
No...
I like the song. Video definitely needs work.
Great song but this video sucks
Hope she collabs with Cheryl Crow
Im gonna have to watch 3 Toby Keith videos to get this video out of my mind.  Boring and I don't want to see her boobs.
Not a fan and the video terrible
Naked butt and this song ain't cutting it sorry bounce on say you gotta try harder ....
❤❤❤❤❤
Nothing "COUNTRY" about this song.
🤮 gross
If only she would wear clothes
Everything she touches turns to gold❤❤
This isn’t even a country song officially never listening to any of her songs again 😂 like what is this. It’s not even country
We need a Miley remix!
Definitely catchy! Will be watching out for the line dance❤
Experimentar, esta guay. Y ella puede nosotros la mayoria no . Asi que callar y disfrutar, y sino salgan por la puerta sin hacer ruido
The video is so lazy and insulting to an audience. It's a loop of her dressed like an android pleasure bot. It has nothing to do with the song and absolutely nothing to do with Texas. Great song, great voice, trash video.
Horrible
I've read the lyrics and it just sounds like an AI wrote this song based on what it thinks it's like being country. How is this a charting song? There's literally nothing that speaks to anyone ...
Roflmbo these comments are priceless. Folks acting like she jus cured all diseases. And only she can make country music great. Roflmbo. I don't even care too much for country but of all the real country singers that were always country that have so much better music than she could even dream of and now all of a sudden folks that would have strangled someone who played some country near em are country music fans. Roflmbo a reeking skit of desperation could not been written. The gullibility and zombielike worship of society is so priceless. Horror spoof of reality. 😂😂😂
Wow lame song and really awful video. There is no talent to make this cheap video or song. Beyonce used to be awesome now she's a joke.
This isn't a country song lol!! just because it has a bango in the back ground doesn't make it country. it's R&B with a bango sound this is stupid and she's too old to dressing like she's 21.. this is stupid but funny. Madonna better watch out old Beyonce is coming for ya 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maybe not...Beyonce
This is fire 🔥
PLEASE ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR SAVIOR, THIS IS ALL IN VAIN...THIS NUDENESS IS SICKNESS....
"Don't be a bitch come take it to the floor now" - wow how come no-one ever thought about this complicated, clever, inspiring and profound lyrics? Better than Sandy Denny, Sibylle Bayer, even John Denver's Take me Home, Country Roads. More like Take it to the floor, Country hoes... Wow, so empowering  Such great vocals, and poor lyrics/ aesthetics/instrumentals...  The music industry is doomed  Sorry but not so sorry
Leaving this comment so years from now if anyone interacts I get to come back and revisit this song!   R&B pop and country fan here loving this combo from the queen
So if she posts a video naked then it's suddenly ok Youtube?
This is a mother.....
That ain't country
When did we go from Halo to curse words half of a song 😢
how tf is this country? it’s fckn trash
Beyonce wins again lol
🤦🤣🤣so she has to show a half boob to get back in the vibe ? 🤦🤦🤦
Not country, ok song, but not country.
Great song! Horrible repetitive video.... Love you B
Beyonce doing country was not on my bingo card for 2024. Queen B is slayin.
And why does she have to be half naked?
Garbage! go back to that other trash you make. Just tainted the scene with skid marks
Stay on your lane B. Country music is not your style.
And With That Being Said CECRED Beyonce Very Very Elegant Beyonce 💕 Texas Hold em Worldwide 16 Carriages Energy Energy Check Lil Wu
Beyonce, love ya, but not feeling this. It's definitely NOT your best look or sound. My opinion.
Sooooo boring video 😴
Whoa what the hell happened to being elegant n beautiful girl, Jay - Z fkd up you in too many ways aye, when yah going to stand up for yourself. Bring back that church going and God fearing good girl.
🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
lady...put a tshirt on!
Bruh, the beehive just letting anything slide smh
Ordinary stuff with extraordinary promotion
stupid song
This is such an ordinary song. I guess the Billboard is also owned by Liberal share holders that are acting towards an agenda. Lol Trump 2024 for the world!
😒 idk
music today is pathetic....fucking paint by numbers corporate approved bullshit
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Give up I don’t like it ,, this is not for her sorry but not sorry,,
Why is she almost naked. Girl put some clothes on
Beyoncé should collab with Paris Texas
Why is it all the same?
Why the nudity?
This is country?
Horrible video!
She doing anything to get that album of the year award in any category on gawd
You forgot your cowboy boots girl!   Nice beat.   Has a hint of country to it. More than Taylor for sure.   Not bad but could do without the profanity.
Nope! Please stay with RnB, she's better at her old music always dominates, but this Nooo
Sorry....shes not country  Stay in your own genre..!
She not as good as people say with this song. She also needs to respect country dress ware. Her outfit is a slap in the face to country females
i feel uncomfortable seein her that naked. unneccessiary, she looks gorgeous with clothes on. she dont really need that like other girls need it.
This is not a country music video... it's AI laziness for porn addicts.  WTF is a "Visualizer"😂.  Beyonce is from Texas & she can dance... Deadpool would call this MINIMUM EFFORT.
🤍🤍🤍
This is pure garbage. Hendrix crossed the racial barrier in music. This is crap. This will evaporate in two weeks. This music will not last .
kanye west tyler the creator Lil wayne fifty cent  is next with banjo  Republicans
What a stupid video. Let’s just walk around half naked and pretend shoot in the dark. Song is ok, I’m mostly underwhelmed
This is horrible and not a country song. It's just porn
I hope she doesnt quit her day job... but ive never liked her and just never seen the hype  but a real country woman woulr never say "dont be a bitch " ..... either way this is the 1st and last time i will ever hear this. I came to check it out just to see if i would like it...  Then noticed it was on repeat for 4 loops i think so cheapest country song already.. then shes trying to be more sexy while looking uncomfortable af. And then has like a course and 1 verse.   Yep someone hold her back .... yall better watch out for this next threat 😂😂😂
ILLUMINATI 👎🤑
What the heck is a "Visualizer"? And that outfit is ridiculous.
But this isnt country...its more like taylor swifts pop....
This must be the cheapest music video ever, same 16 seconds on loop
I love it You go girl
That's some of the worst country ever
Nasty, put some clothes on, I told ya Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya Girl, what you thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya  remember that from somewhere? love beyonce but PLEASE..PLEEEEEASE put some clothes on finally.  try to score with talent instead of nvdity
Too naked and too many curses for a country piece. 😢
No respect for her.
This is not country I’m a fan of Beyoncé but this no
I like it
It’s a great pop song with a twang.  It’s not a country song.
I love this song go Beyonce you deserve the world
Så braa!!! 😊
For all of y'all saying you usually don't like country music, but like this.... It's because it's not country. Just because she has country references in there doesn't mean it's country. The beat of it is still very much Hip-poppy. Not hating. Just saying.
I like country music..and I think  Beyoncé did a pretty good job with this genre.
This is not country. Yall are all blind.
She took Country music and trash the entire country music history... She's dress like a w*-+re... She need to stay in her trash category not insulted country music like that
She needs to stick to what she knows, country isn't one of them, makes her sound hideous. 😳
Most y'all only loving this song because who the singer Is if someone new came out with it your tail no u wouldn't like it so  STOP IT STOP THE FAKE LOVE  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
❤❤❤ Love Me Some Country Singing!!!You Go Girl !!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ugh
Ugh
I love this tune 🎉 ❤
So this is trash but of course it's Bey. It's gonna blow up. She's overrated
Bro tryna win all them Grammys lol
Hick hop not country . She has a beautiful voice but it's not country music 😢
Nope
I liked the music but girl you need to put some clothes on if you want to go country. Most parents are not going to let their children watch this. Heck we don't even think Taylor Swift is country. If you were to cover up more than it would be kid friendly.
fake idols
Yeah...I kept hearing Beyonce is singing country now and you will be blown away.  Nothing to see here but a singer.
Terrible music, she thinks that adding an accent and that generic background music makes it country. Also the video is so cheap, literally 7 seconds of her almost naked. Very unenthusiastic and fake music.
Trash
I guess she gonna remake Jolene too.
Is this video a joke? Is the song a joke?!? What in the name of boring is this a loop of the same shot?
Yup .... good tune!  What kind of moron thought this vid was cool. Vid is just stupid. Sheesh.
This song is horrible
How dare she desecrate country music!! Abomination!!
Love you bee
This is fucking awful.
🤠  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the music ....the  video...absolutely not! 🫡
I love QB but it’s the same 7 seconds on replay. So many things she could have done with this but this was a call it in - sick day. Fierce outfit   Hair on point. Video content. 7 s. TikTok. I’m dialing in a negative. Maybe contact a producer/conductor with decades of cred.  Ummmm TS?
Beyonce will never be a country artist to real country fans but she will be a country artist to pop fans who don’t actually listen to country. Just like if Taylor swift the big pop artist was to make a rap album.. she will never be a rap artist to actual rap fans but will be to pop fans who don’t listen to rap music. The hot country, rap, R&b, rock charts that’s been around since only 2013 are based off of pop radio stations (not the actual genres stations) and downloads. These are the same charts that had k pop songs like Gangnam style at #1 on the rap charts which had rap fan’s annoyed because it’s not rap. The airplay charts are a better true representation on the genres than these water down pop charts based on pop lovers not the actual genre lovers.   I will give Beyonce the benefit of the doubt if she keeps making a complete dedication to making country music then she has a chance but for now she’s just a pop artist who chose to just jump into a genre she’s not.
So beautiful 🤩
Wack,
This generic shit is what people are raving about? Lmao music is dead
Such a disgrace to country music, trash,  trash
I wouldn’t mind after she does country she do rock songs, I would like to see it.
This is not country
Wow Beyoncé got desperate. She really sux
That’s the beat to the theme song from the old cartoon Franklin the turtle. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Lame 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
too hot to think straight too cold to panic 8Mil
❤Hell YES!! Beyonce you ARE the Queen
Adele is younger and more subs. And she is conservative 🙄 😒
Where are Beyonce's clothes?????????????/ This is disgusting
not a bad song, too bad she chose to looks like a sloot.
Terrible video...
Honey your over 40. It's TIME TO grow up and be a modest WOMAN.
This ain’t country. This is a joke. Total cash grab.
I ain't no down home Texas county boy ehhh haaaa and no country music listening expert but I going to say music changes I get it but there are two different country eras the one were u talked about honky tonks getting drunk and driving ur truck, and these morden hipbhoppy country thst i wanted say stsrred around 2000s.
Okay we got black cowgirls lol 😂😂😂😂
She's managed to stink up country with the B word. Otherwise, it's an average song with a peep show front and center. Meh
Please, put some clothes on. This is not nice.
I'm not a fan of the of this music video or the song
Um....nope, sounds ridiculous!
I'm not into country music but this one by Beyonce is 😎
Linda martell was the first black woman
Just no
I said i wasn't gonna like this song. I listened to it at 9am today EST, i have since aquired a sparkly cowboy hat and am going to ride a horse next month. I have also practiced my line dancin, gun shootin and whiskey drinkin because when Beyonce says yee we says haw  🤣😭
That’s the worst song I’ve ever heard in my life and she wins the award for worst outfit
Video is 👎👎..trashy.. one eyed stuff.. illuminati??
….and The Grammy Award For The 2024 Album Of The Year Is…
WTF is she wearing?  Definitely not country. Hey Dolly, hey Loretta, she needs some schoolin’!
Wtf is this garbage
I do like this song, but put some clothes on B
Not even close to country! All Show no country soul! Not #1 in Nashville.
Not the best music video it's just a repeat of the same thing 🙄
This video is just pitifull.
mfw it is texas
So Now country girls have to be Sleezy and pretty much Naked? Geez where has the Class in Women gone?  Even in Country Music Now they have to be Naked too ? Country music had more Values, Guess thats going to be Gone now too ugh This world
Waylon Jennings,Charlie Daniels,Toby,George, would love this...... Wearing a cowboy hat doesn't make you country. I live in Florida and hunt gators, eat hogs I never kill cause my dogs do it for me,Own Firearms but prefer to shoot deer with recurve bow,grow my own food,raise my own livestock,praise God through our Christian beliefs,and get this we live in the woods and have never lived in a city. We don't wear cowboy hats down here we wear renegade hats.  "Country Boy Can Survive"
This is trash not a real country song and just because she from Texas don’t make her country I’m from the country and if you didn’t grow up country you not country I’m talking bout dirt roads and your next door stays so far you can’t walk to there house cause it would take hours to get there we chop wood cut grass and deer, rabbit and duck hunt , plant gardens and burn garbage outside in a trash barrel and have dogs and chickens outside not in the house and drive tractors when you are 10 years old that’s country and im proud to be kountry but this song is not kountry it’s more R&B with a fake country sound
Absolute trash
Great country song. Thank you.
this song is garbage. who would think this is a good country song?
Can people please stop pretending that black people created country music? country music comes from FOLK music, which existed way before the US was even founded. Folk music comes from the German word "volk". Country music, jazz, rock, bluegrass, psychobilly, rockabilly; all these genres stem from FOLK music. SOME of those genres (country, jazz, blues) are products of black AND white people collaborating, creating beautiful things TOGETHER, yet the foundations of country come from folk music, created by white people. To overlook the contributions of either demographic to those genres is unfair.  Plus, the foundations of musical theory were laid way before the US was founded. Not one instrument used to play jazz, country, bluegrass, rock, or country was created by black people, all those instruments were created by Germans, Spaniards, and Italians. FACT. There are black cowboys and cowgirls, but Beyonce isn't one of them.  Not everybody from Houston is a cowgirl or a fan of country. If her country music was good tho, that would be one thing. But why does she feel it's necessary to morph into a white woman to release a country album. Her skin is way lighter than ever before (like Oprah, lil Kim, Nicki Minaj), she lives in straight blonde wigs.  It's def giving appropriation, and that Texas hold em song is straight up trash 😆🗑️ "Ultimately, country music's roots lie in the ballads, folk songs, and popular songs of the English, Scots, and Irish settlers of the Appalachians and other parts of the South." " In essence, country is one part of folk. It is a unique style of folk music. Folk music—even in its second wave—didn't stray from its pure form." "Country music has a rich and diverse history that spans over a century, evolving from the traditional folk music of the Southern United States". "Country Music emerged as British Isles settlers moved into the Appalachians. A fusion of English fiddle music, Scots-Irish dance music & American blues."  It's extremely disrespectful (and borderline racist) to overlook and exclude the contributions white people made to  the foundations of musical theory in general and folk, country, rock, blues, etc.
And all you worshippers are gonna say this is awesome    This is pure trash hot ass garbage juice
Skank!
How old is her kids now? Is it necessary?
A woman with no clothes is always a hit. The song sucks . Tired old lady begging for a new crowd
Trashy
Ryan Bingham ft. Beyonce lets see it
La canción buena, el video aburrido como nada
This is not country music in my opinion. Not sure what you want to call it but not country.
Girl, you don't look country enough. Where are the boots, cowboy hat and the country clothes? Put some clothes on, why do you have to show your body, you are making people lust.  Repent.  Why not sing some gospel music and use your voice to glory God and not yourself.   Do you honestly think that God doesn't care?  He does, repent and turn to the Lord, put clothes on and stop cussing please, before your time is up.
Waiting for George Strait to come out with his hip hop album!  That'll show 'em!!
Nah mate... nah
Should stick to R & B.  This doesnt sounds country at all.
Porn country. Will Not be listening
A lot of country music is based on black music, so why not? Country and bluegrass are like a mix of Irish Celtic and Black blues. If white people are going to rip off marglainized people the people who invented the sound might as well own it.
Stick to your lane homegirl. Soon your husband will crying that you didn't get a country trophy 😂😂😂 backoff Texas Ain't want you.
“Don’t be a b*#*h come take it to da flo now! Whew!”   Wonder what the small towns are thinking now!
All of you saying you’re “suddenly country fans” and “you don’t like country but this one different”… no thanks. It’s an assembly of country clichés laid over a track composed to fit into a mould. I also reject all the “country” songs on the radio that fit this formula.  Also, a country singer wouldn’t dress like that. I only came here to see if there’s actually any substance to be found and I’m not surprised. It’s catchy, sure, but it was specifically meant to be by cynical posers in Hollywood and has nothing to do with real country music.
i find it very annoying everything she says is followed up with repeating what she just said
What is this trash 🤮🤮🤮
New genre country hop
Here in Music City (Nashville)can tell you this will not Fly! Stay in your Lane
This is crap
Maybe her other songs are better.
Is it just me or is the whole video basically on repeat and shes doing the same thing on repeat? I mean hey, takes a master musician to put that together right. Hard pass, garbage.
I think she sucks! That is not country!
This song will revive country line  dancing in CA again!! Love it!!   She is singing about real stuff, gotcha your banjo, tornados, dive bars, heat waves, gotcha a country song girl!
Better if she had more clothes on - she has her fans - that's who's boosting the views and curious people.  This doesn't even tell a story.
The video is absolutely terrible forget the song the video makes zero sense its just trash 😂
Im a Texan...not a fan of B or country music, BUT to people that are hatin on her for this...um she is a Texan, hellooo and this sounds more country than the shit they play on the country stations🤷‍♀️ngl i kinda dig it.  Why dont she put some clothes on tho, damn🙄
Damn. This is good.
That’s not country
This is fire ofcourse we knew that and lets not forget her hometown is Houston Texas this sounds like she did this with ease such a vibe with so much rhythm sounds like black church music in the background when my grandma and them use to dance it up in the church this is 🔥🔥🔥
sorry im trying to understand how this is a country song ?
This sucks for real
That is some excellent music for a porn video background.  WOW
In pursuit of the elusive album of the year 😆 🤣 😂
Meh....
❤️❤️❤️
Average at best. Lyrics are very cliche. Nothing special here.
🤢🤮
"All of the problems just feel dramatic"  She knew exactly what she was doing releasing this😂 🔥 🔥
this is a good song but the finger gun and the suit where you can see everything is not country coming from and southern person
I love you Beyoncé
I do not see this as country. As for the video it's her top side showing off .  This is just a scam to get into the country scene. It stunk!
Those are perfect
Bummer.. Thought there was an actual video with line dance moves or something. I feel cheated😂
American roots are brown and black, not because of the stolen dirt their sitting in either
Nothing says country like whatever nonsense she is wearing.
It's not country at all
Something wrong with wearing clothing? Too much nudity and too much swearing for this genre
😃Nice ...
Thank God for tik tok
This is horrible!! She sounds terrible with her Ho outfit on!!! Beyoncé, stay away from country!!
WTF is that outfit you look ridiculous?  Seems like you're making fun of country music honestly.
She just made a song. Pootie tang predicted idiotic music and fans
i’m sorry but this is not real country music, she is an amazing artist but she should stick to her genre bc this doesn’t sound like country sorry
This not country, this is a mockery of country. I like Beyonce and all, but this is just not it.
This song makes me wanna go nuts at the club and party like it’s 1985 again! Hell yes!!! I’ve never heard a gem like this! Absolute masterpiece.
I like the song but not the video. It's better than the pop country rock on the Nashville pop country radio stations that I don't bother to listen to hardly anymore. There's a country station out of Wickinburg, AZ, that plays classic country music with some new Nashville pop rock country.
What’s with the outfit? Doesn’t belong in the country world 😒 smh… someone had to come ruin country for the rest of us that actually love it!
She’s desperate… lol
I didn’t think anything could suck more than this song. Then I seen this video.
Loving this
GROSS KEEP TEXAS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
NO BEYONCE, JUST NO!!!!!! Just because Lil Nas X can pull off country and just because you ain't getting enough attention in your own genre, does not mean to need to insult country music like this. Why, just why. NO. Sorry, love ya but no. And all ya hood itches that don't listen to country but "like this" are just Beyonce brown nosers. Sorry. I said what I said.
Country ghetto. There,i said it
Jajajaja so funny 🤣
Garbage
I don't know what it is about middle age women always having to expose themselves to do a song I feel after the age of 35 we should be tapering it off and looking appropriate with our songs because what you're telling the young girls is let it all hang out and this is not something that should be acceptable but of course this is the world
It's real "campy", cheap Broadway, where is the rest of the song?  You have a chorus you keep bridging back to itself after you started with it. It is not only a monotone circle jerk to my brain, like I'm holding your arms and spinning while you sing it to me all while trying to convince me we're having fun, but it's so basic you may as well have written it to be a jingle on a commercial.   It took me this long to listen to it I'm not disappointed  It's like they put the rodeo clown on the bull for shits and giggles
Does she need to dress like this? 👎🏾
A mother of 3 child? No ! Where is the respect ?
Cultural appropriation!! 😂
She should be the next MK character. She looks like a black female Kano 😂
Song’s okay. Ain’t no tiddies in country music tho. Not like that at least.
My 3rd time listening
Oh my god I am not really a country fan but I had to check this out! Beyonce can make anything catchy! Definitely unique and really good! Cool to see Beyonce trying some like this out. What a surprise never know what artists are gonna do next! Great work Beyonce!
Hey all I asked for was some steel guitar and fiddle as a country gal. She delivered more than I expected.  I would jam to her while mudding in my truck
This is not country, it sucks
Ay mamá 🤠
this is horrible
Not her best song
Black women will say anything she do is great and this the lamest crap ever!!!
The best country song I've heard in years...
Stupid outfit - come on now...
My take is Beyonce singing in front of country music while reading a book on how to do a bunch of steriotypical things country singers do in one song. lmao. Love Beyonce but this is so COUNTRY TWANG WACK! What the fuck is she wearing on top of it, just horrible.Lets put every country word I can think of in a song.
Necesitamos Video para ya mi Reina.. a romperla
Absolutely garbage.
Looks like Beyonce is taking over country music, country music artists move on over because Bey is coming!
This is awesome.
Not a bad song, but this video ruins it.
Yesss my baby ate 😢❤
Queen take over " HOLD EM DOWN"😊
Nooooooooooooooo
What the fuck is this trash 😂😂😂
Linda martell and Charley Pride would've  done it better tbh. Country isnt for beyoncé imo
Worst outfit ever, it’s comical😂
Still hip hop not country. Taylor swift will still win next year.
The song is all you. Love you ❤. I really wish you made a different choice of video. You are an artist, woman and absolutely amazing. Im not judging you,    i just know your better than most. The song is still amazing beautiful woman that you are.
Her outfit 🤮
I don't think she's a good singer and what nobody's gonna take bout how perverted this looks
Ehhhhh I don’t get it like you guys I guess… nothing great
This is the dumbest song I have ever heard. Seriously.
This is terrible
What trash, I guess it's all about her boobs.
I hate it
Birdy - Words as Weapons????????????
I call psyop
Trash
This isn't country it's Beyonce if she moved five minutes from downtown
Nothing like her song "If I were a boy" to me that's the best tune she's done; the falsettos was great on that song!
Sounds terrible 😢
A shirt would look nice on you. You're 42 with three kids.
This is honestly really cringe but I'm a sucker for country so maybe that's why I dig the beat and vocal chorus.
And this is not country music.  Stick to what you know.  Not a fan
I will never like this
This is very bluegrassy. Love it.
This sounds like a parody of country music. Is Beyonce mocking country?
Not a fan
Stay in your lane. Nobody needs this.
Sorry, I love Beyoncé but this song is not good.
Is she making fun of country music, WTH!! SHAME ON BEYONCE THIS IS WORSE THEN WHEN SWIFT WAS SO CALL COUNTRY MUSIC
Shit is trash yo
Reminds me of what Kanye friend been dressing like plus the illuminati one eye symbol also the song is crappy
She totally took the country game over!
Sorry im not feeling it & i really dont care who is singing it!
Beyoncé has done country music before with a video around the campfire don’t even start lol
Really, my opinion, that song is 🗑 trash.  The outfit is trash to the video is trash.😮 SORRY JUST MY OPINION
She’s tryin way too hard with that “outfit”
OMG. 😅
Song sucks
🤔...is this for real?  Seriously? Ahh...I never seen anyone sing naked and use derogatory  language in a country song? 🙆‍♀️
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kenny Rodgers would be proud.
I can tell you that this song is the worst song I ever heard from Beyonce.....
Not her using the Franklin theme song 😂😂
🤮
I'm so happy right now
she’s covering an eye. Y’all a fan of a satanist.
Song: not my style  Video: couldn’t be more my style 🤩
I am a fan of country music and I hate this.
Love you ve the song. Not too sure about the video.
The song is good
Stupid video. Too trashy.

typical one eye symbolism in the entertainment industry
What makes this song country?
Stupid video. Nice song. Dont need to see boobs.
Skanky
AI generated
IT'S GOOD. VERY GOOD.
Total garbage!
This crapbag sucks in all genres.
Hard no…..
I like it this isn't Texas
Damn Right
I'm not usually a fan of country music either, but this song is particularly bad and the video does not help at all.
This aint country lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She's a diva but here 😢 very low.  A very disappointed and her choices
Sucks
Cultral appropreation? Why is Beyonce taking the whyte peoples culture? is she trying to be whyte?
Like the music, hate the video. The semi nakedness is totally unnecessary.
Never heard this much cursing in a country song since ....cotton eye joe 😂 guess it sells 😂
No thanks
I thought this was real video , really
Beyoncé should do a remake of this music video with all those TikTok dance videos I've been seeing to this song. 😉😊✌❤
Dang over 7 million views in 10 days. I know I have looked at 100 different videos of this song😂 You get em Bey!
Ever heard of Charlie Pride
Good song..stupid video
It's only popular because she's basically naked and people wanted to hear it not like anyone actually likes it or enjoys it.
It's not a bad song but it's not country music, at all.
Put some clothes on, and you got it
Pretty good. But their are too many women with better voices & looks in country. I bet half her fan base will love it. Probably, about %25 of country fans will like it. So,  it won’t be a complete flop but she needs to change her image to make it in country
This disgusts me! She is really desperately reaching. THIS is a pathetic attempt to stay relevant. The outfit makes her look cheap !
This isn’t country
Please put you clothes on, that’s not Texas. Why every artist gotta take their clothes off to sell music.  Getting old, tired of these skanks.
Yeah she sings beautifully, but the lack of modesty, and profanity ain’t it! We don’t need our children looking up to this. Find Jesus before it’s too late!
Cultural appropriation? Or free speech. Its all good but it actually bad video.
*This song has such an infectious beat that without even thinking, your feet start twitching, and then suddenly, your legs start tapping, & before you can say 'yeehaw,' you & the entire family are hopping around, singing along hollering, & having one big old-fashioned, knee-slapping, foot-stomping, real-life hoedown.*   🎶     👯     🕺🏽     😀
Stay in your own lane beyonce!
Too little too late.  Not having it!
That is good she is doing other genres, I hope she does some rock....
People have no shame anymore and apparently this is good country music. Okay. This world is officially broken.
Huge country music fan, but this just didn't hit the way I was hoping. Not a fan, and seriously, what was with that video? Repeat repeat repeat and use the boobs to attract attention. Beyonce you can do better.
"Hey its frankiln"
Respectfully this is Garbage definitely not country 😂
Worst video ever!!
That is country music.I don’t listen to country music but It is what it is .Y’all will get used to it. Lmao She will fit right into it.
I don't like it!!! :0/
The Franklin theme song sample is amazing. My childhood
Glad I didn't watch the whole, boring video
Terrible
I guess she had to dress practically nude in order to sell the song. What? She doesn't have confidence in selling country music. Pathetic!
Girl ease stick to what ur si ginger now.
This is the stupidest so ever
I like the song, but it is not country.
Stopped this at 0:36. To say, Whomever labeled this as "Country" needs to be fired.. there isn't anything country about Beyonce. Or this song!
Heyyyyyy it’s Franklin!!!
So Beyoncé thinks she’s The Lumineers now ? This sounds like a folk song with the heavy use of Banjo 🪕 I hate it 😅
Absolute crap
The only thing I can see she blows real good
So this is why she bleached her skin....
What a mega talent,she jus cant help it!!
That's terrible lol
Not a great country song to begin with...and the dress code she's wearing is a total joke to country people, more like trashy.
Im here for Beyoncé but this song aint it... you can literary put an R&B track behind it and it would sound the same. All they did was add twangy instrumentals.
Worst video ever..song not so bad...
This shit is ass no wonder the radio station turn them down 😂
Slayer is coming out of retirement and doin rap
She's SUCKS , Along with this song
She’s burned herself out with her typical repetitive lyrics and now this … yawn. Switching genres Doesnt make it any better
Why half naked?
I’m from Texas & I like a little country twang. I like the song - BUT - I don’t like the video 🤮🤮🤮🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
Rubbish song...
This is a joke like Florida  Georgia Line
Great song..
All I'm saying boobs will sell anything
Elvis never won a Grammy for Rock and Roll.
Life's too short to rulen country music
Taylor prolly shakin in her boots after this one 😂. Ready to see the next Grammy awards after this album.
If this is country music dog can sing anything
She sounds like Katherine Hepburn talking to Henry Fonda on GOLDEN POND
He had alliah killed 4 dis smfh
This song sucks so hard. I like Beyonce but if you actually like country music this seems like a spoof of what she thinks country music is.  It's awful!
Tornado really did hit my city (Hendersonville Tn)
I think she needs to stay in her lane and stop mocking Country Music! She aint country!!!
This has to be a joke. This is so bad. Whoever wrote this song was definitely mad at Beyonce to do this to her. 😅
What a ridiculous outfit!!!   Come on Beyoncé are you so insecure you have to be half naked to get attention from the men.   Put some he and and a nice plain top on.
It's not country music!!!
Oh I'm visualizing all right
I think you should cover up and don’t use curse words…..so disrespectful for young girls who look up to you including your own daughter……
Taylor Swift ruined country so much that a pop song with words synonymous with country passes as a country song...... Lol nothing about this sounds country maybe folk. I will give her points for using actual percussion tho and not just dance clap
She's defined more country than Taylor Swift
this aint no country music song. country music songs got a storyline.. a meaning and a mesage. this song got none of those. this is also to gadamn 808.. Country got swing. i highly doubt that even Jay~Z and Beyonce know what im talking about but...  3 STARS. 1 for effort and another 1 for being brave and the last star is because this is so gadamn radio friendly. good job !!
The heck is she wearing? Why does every genre of music need to be hoe-ified?
🗑
Put some clothes on woman!
Country has been destroyed since the 90s, so why not make it worse i guess
This ain't country
Did she sample this song from Franklin theme song?
🚮
Not really country but more modern country. No hate and if she can do it go for it. Don’t care either way.
This song sucks and Beyonce should stay in her lane.
2:47 is that a music video??  Song's good though.
So un tasteful
This is a really dumb video
“HEYYYY ITS FRANKLINNN”
This kinda feels like it was written for Jessica Simpson or inspired by her.
What a horrible song I can't even get past the first couple of lines.
😂 This just in 👢 👢  sales have hit a record breaking all time high 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Got Dat illuminate snake and one eye for someone who so sick of Dat mess she keep it on her videos . I guess she getting every attention she can. Lol smart tactics gotta give her credit where it due
Go play some Merle Haggard, George Jones, Alan Jackson, or George Strait if you want to hear true country. This right here is junk. I can't even tell you want genre it is, but it's not country. If it's not something you'd play at a cattle ranch working cattle with all the men, then it's not country. 😂
I’m be honest I don’t feel the country kinda a fail
Snooze fest 😴
Why she tryna look like Latto lately 😂
Bringing back the banjos 🪕 🪕🪕🪕🪕 Love it!❤
I like some of her stuff but this is horrible. The disrespect to a Classy genre. Is above and beyond
Dumb
I’m not usually a Beyoncé fan but pretty great wow
Again she’s practically naked the outfit looks stupid the song does not suit her the video does not depict real country music I wish she would let her voice be her talent  I love her music I will not be listening to her new album
Disgusting......
anything for a buck
Nasty.
Not impressed. Doesn't sound country at all. She forgot her blouse, makes her look ridiculous, not talented.
SHE is a great vocal talent and it is a GREAT song and I look forward to hearing the rest of the album.
This is not country music.
Trashy trashy trashy
This is not country and is awful.
She said real life hoe down 🤣.  Yes she is 🤣
Garbage
I love her but I hate country.
I hate to say it, but country music won't take her seriously while she's dressed like that. I think we all know her fans are the only ones who will really listen to this anyway. It is a good song, she just needs to realize the audiences are different.
Y not
Not country - sorry. Nice try though.
This IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!!!! Just because it has a fucking guitar and the word “texas” in it doesn’t make it country music. I’m so sick of pop country. If you actually want to hear country music listen to people like Cody Johnson or George Strait. This is an insult to country music.
If she went on American Idol or The Voice (without the sexy af outfit) she wouldn't make it past tryouts with this song. She's an amazing, talented, successful artist with a ridiculously beautiful voice, but this song? This is it?!? So disappointing. :/  I was really hoping she'd knock it out of the park. That outfit made it to #1, not the song.
If this was Taylor Swift white people wouldn’t be complaining 😂   Let’s get it BEYONCE!
Kmt smh she goin sing every genre to win album of the year like Taylor Swift smh 🤦‍♀️ sick woman all about the fame and stupid golden statues and no God !! Silly goose !!
Texas yay
Oh and if this is official video it sucks.......just porn
Is this supposed to be a music video?!
What a joke!
GOD IM SO IN FOR THIS NEW COUNTRY ERA
All of a sudden blacks into country 😂
wtf is this crap !?!?!
GREAT Song!!!
Why?????????*??
Congrats to Queen Bey for being the first Black female artist to have a #1 on the country charts. That's a big deal... ✌️💙
😂😂😂😂 yeah righto  "Country"  Sure thing
This shit is ass 😂😂
Franklin the Turtle theme song....you're welcome. 😂
Now she is going to ruin country music 🤐🤮🤮🤮like let’s be necked everywhere and use profanity great job
GARBAGE!!
Song is terrible so is her look
This is not country
Loretta, Tammy, and Dolly never dressed like this. It’s just not country!
This sucks.
Sorry not country….
Complete garbage
This is pop music with a country beat
Fucking disgraceful to everything country.
Could you imagine if she used her gift to give glory to GOD 🙏
Just because you call this country doesn’t make it so. This is a pile of dog shit.
Doesn’t even sound even a little bit close to country music whatsoever 🤔🤔🤔
Its not bad.  Not really country per se.  Wonder what Merle would think
Sleazy
Don’t care for it. At all.
Queen ❤
Bahhahah 😂 Sad
.... wtf is this . Its sure not country lol.
She finally did it! You said you didn't think there were enough black women in country music so you did something about it! Great job.
This is the worst country song I have heard
bee.. too much nakedness. idk about the video. I do miss your old style of music tho. still love you so much.
If you want to do country music  then she could  choose  better class of dressing  instead of half dressed. She looks ridiculous.  No respect for herself.
Why is she half naked?
I love country! This is good
Really 🤣no class at all
😂😂😂😂😂 So stupid!!!
Very distasteful really degrating😮
alvv que chichotas
🤮
Didnt think i was going to like it. However I love it
Like most of Beyoncés videos…but this legit was a waste of 4 minutes of time.  If she wants to be considered a cross over country, this isn’t the way to prove it. As much money as she is worth, she could have done a real country video!
Keep this stupid shit on the r&b charts I don’t wanna see it
Took me half the video to realize her video is looped the entire time. 😂😂
Please Stop. Terrible
I feel like I'm in church!! Need me a tambourine!! Wooo hoo!!!
Unfortunate she can’t make a decent video without  being half naked and cussing.
Terrible  stick to the music that you dominate    leave country alone please
Her voice does not even sound country at all I don't like it
I love you so much Beyonce I wish I can met you
Cute song with a Country Twang Beyonce . I dont hate it,  I hate the outfit tho! Your beautiful you should have rocked some Daisy Dukes and held up a salon like a Outlaw. That would have rocked.
Ah well... you know... I'm not a country fan. And I really think we should leave their thing alone. I'm disappointed that this will take the place of another episode in Beyonce's historic R&B catalog. There's one less Beyonce album because of this banjo picking mess that I'm never listening to. I'm sad.
Just pure stupidity
What a crock.....
So classless.
#1 on the Country Billboards..they mad🤣🤣
You got to know when to hold ‘em , know when to fold them , know when to walk away
Nul
Trash song no way it’s number one. Fake views
Oh I am amazed alright. 🤮
Of course got to show the boobis
First. I hated the cross-over. Disgusted at a cross-over by Beyonce. Second. Got home. Damn. I love the cross-over. I watched the video. I saved the song. I created a station (that didn't work - got R&B rather than country - iTunes fix this for unique cross-overs...)... and now. I am a fan.
I was really looking forward to her dancing to this like we seen all over til Tok the song is great but this video was not was I expecting she has a beautiful talent
Im more of a country music purist i like country to stay country and not be tainted by other genres. Its like i love pineapple and i love pizza but i want them to stay separate otherwise it sucks. That being said, considering that alot of country music these days is just hiphop with cowboy hats on, this aint bad at all, in fact, remove the cuss words and id say this is a pretty good song. You need work on the country tune and voice for the music, but apart from that its not bad. This is what your first country song? You will get better, for a first country song, not bad, assuming you get better at it.
Too much swearing and put some clothes on!!!!!!!
Song is catchy.  Is an "official visualizer" what you call a  clip put on a loop?
This is pure $HIT
As a country girl tbh idk what to say 🤣 it’s not country I’ll tell yall that
No cabe duda que el mundo está cambiando,! por fin! Country de cantantes de color, pero por qué la vulgaridad y el desnudo, que no basta con el talento? Por qué tienen que vulgarizar todo,??? Me parece un vídeo sin clase. Que lejos quedamos de la maravillosa TAKE ME HOME🤔
I'm assuming you're incapable of wearing clothes to sing???  YOU are the 'HO''' going down...
This is NOT country music AT ALL😂 FOOLERY
😂😂 this ain’t country
She made a country song for 2024
❤ love it.....new fan 2024🎉
Sorry, this shit ain't country.  Stay in your genre.
I'm sorry but this is crap music....
Sick.......
Beyonce es como la Michael Jackson mujer , insuperable y no existirá otra igual ❤
Come on guys I'm a fan but this is a joke....fr fr give me a break..
Not country music but, hip hop with a little slice of country.
Come on guys I'm a fan but this is a joke....fr fr give me a break..
This is awful.
Sucks, just another Beyoncé pop song. Not genuine country, half naked to get the rest of her pop fanbase to stream, people will stream her singing the phone book. Doesn’t make it quality music for the country masses. This too shall pass.
She popped the bubble. Period. It’s a viral!!!!
Came here to hate. Because wtf is this. Sure you can make country music, but it comes off as non believable and inauthentic. Country is more than just a banjo and some buzzwords. It's music that defines the hardships and realities of rural America.
all this video shows is a half naked beyonce......umm this aint country stick to R&B
I like it
Why does she need to be basically naked
No no no no good
🤢
She's not Charley Pride, that's for darned sure. But good for her.
TOTAL GARBAGE.......... Not a clue what country music is about...
She has the grossest legs
I personally don’t listen to country but spent the last two years with it on repeat on a construction site and even I would not consider this country music. Great song but not country, it has a pop gospel melody with some country referenced lyrics and It’s catchy as hell!
This is trash and not country she just mad that Taylor Swift keeps getting all the recognition and awards LMFAO, that's sad
Couldn't she have sung that song without trying to reveal her body. Let's leave nothing to the imagination.Real country is long gone.
If this country I'll kiss your ass. Absolutely nothing about this is country funny after Jay Z cried after Taylor Swift one another album of the year.  😊😮
Trash 😂 real country music fans ain't fuckin with y'all dbaggs
Next song is "Coming around the mountain".  It's an oldie but a goodie.
Reminds me of uncle ruckus at the garden party.
Nice video 🙄
So tired of seeing the same thing. No need to be naked. Like all she does.
This isn't country! This is country wannabe! Beyonce stay with POP! You are good there!
Good job Beyonce!
This is awful
I kept thinking my blinker was on with that clickity clicking.
Not redneck enough for us.
Someone should have told her that repeating that one move over and over and over made this video one of the most boring I think I've ever seen.  I think maybe she needs to stick to what she knows and country ain't it because if she understood country she would understand that her language needed to be cleaned up and she needed to put some clothes on.  This will NOT play very well in Des Moines!  She may be doing this to compete with Taylor Swift but Taylor isn't country either.  Taylor pretended to be country until she built up a huge fan base and then she started doing music that was more her thing and she kicked country music and country music fans to the curb.  I would not walk across the street to see a free concert by either of these women.
This is fucking trash
When did Beyonce become  a white women
This is what a real artists is Beyonce is the queen so much more talent than that Trailer swift
Hey it’s Franklin
Today country for the past 25 years sound like this, it's called "pop country"
I've been a country music girl my whole life but not a fan of her shit she isn't country and never will be
Meh music good but video blah.  I mean kudos to her for looking this good but I’m tired of this
This ain't country.😂
Why would she wear that?
This is not country !
Hey its Franklin vibes 🤣
*_I like the song, just not the video or costume. It's dumb._*
Show 'em if ya got 'em.
Uh, no.
Reading a bunch of comments that have no idea about country.  This is not good.
This is trash lmfao
Un genio ❤ sa reinventarsi sempre Queen B.
😂😂😂
Love it! 🐝 💖👑💃🏿✨️🔥
WHAT THE F--- IS THE POINT OF REPEATING THIS HALF NUDE SCENE OVER AND OVER?? BOOOOORING!!!!
Girl bye awful
😂
She’s not a country singer and that song doesn’t sound like a country song. Stick to your own genre.
Repulsive.  Looks like a country hooker and it’s grasping at country music in the worst way.
Is there a song on here been a little distracted 😂
She never fails to make us amazed at her 😍talent and showmanship 😊
NO

Love this song! Im loving her in her Country Music Era, i loved Daddy's Lesson from her Lemonade album. This is Country music no matter what the salty Kens or Karens say 😂
Pure musical and videography genius. NOT.
Nice......holsters! or is it "Hoesters"...
Definitely not a country song its a pop song.
Not impressed!  Put on some clothes!
Gurl, stay in your lane. This ain’t your thang. Chapel Hart does it better.
I don't like Beyonce's music or popular modern country and this is exactly why she deserves to be #1 because she gave a #1 to the genre that has been giving the #1 to itself in the mirror by the garbage they play. So I'm not mad at her. Modern country music is not country anymore when it's dominated by crossover pop stars and rappers. Don't blame Beyonce. Blame the 4 corporate radio stations that rule the national airwaves. They're giving the #1 to music listeners everywhere.
Not country……
What the fuck is this?
Had to take a lot of talent to make this trash video.
Shes a so called role model for young girls/women, this outfit doesn't help
Not a fan at all!!! New something was up when she was dressed in a cowboy hat n boots @ The grammys!!! Nope definitely not a fan!!!
This is not Country music.
Not impressed
Love this song. I've been a fan of country since the 70s.
Where are her clothes? I'm trying to raise my daughter to be classy, not trashy, no thanks.
Big yikes
LOVE YOU B..
Shitty song, the Illuminati doesn’t give up
That's not country!
Half naked and cursing, sounds and looks more Hip Hop lik
My ears just threw up and my eyes are bleeding. Is that supposed to happen?
Country is a life style u can’t sing country if you don’t live that life
Sorry but don't like this, definitely not country 😳
This feels like cultural appropriation.
Not a fan of Queen Bee, But she is a beautiful  woman, Does not need to show all the boobs. For Attention. Just my opinion.
Cheap poop
Oh this is ridiculous..she looks awful..wth is she wearing..my god come on!
What a bust  This ain’t it, I hope 16 carriages is better lmfao!!!
I like that Beyonce make us women in our 40s feel like we still got it but Beyonce has 2 daughters and a Sir and so many young teenagers and little girls look up to her it's time for her to show us that she can be sexy without the SEX.  U went country now let's put on sum clothes Beyonce.  Much luv❤
The word -itch is not in the county music lexicon.
Love you Bey. This is beautiful. 😌💙🏆
Garbage!   Painful to listen to.
this is not country sorry
Like the song, but the video is boring
This is not country music...This has absolutely nothing to do with country music by any means! If you want to listen to country music, try Tyler Childers.
Beyonce forgot. She wasn't in a strip club or has a job as a low grade pole dancer ! This isn't professional. Stsge  Atire For a cou.btry music artist ! This won't get her the throne. Of Queen of country ! She's not the first Black woman to want to be a country artist ! We have for many years had great women. Become very famous ! Femail country Artist ! And they didn't get naked to doit ! Vulgarity. Isn't the marck of a great prof. Femail country Artist ! It's pride and decency in your. Frof. performance  !  Stage presence means alott in  Country music ! Espeacialy for a woman !  Nudity and Vulgarity kills it every time !  Theirs not mutch chance for Family to bring their children to the country concerts at the Opre for sure ! Country music is always been centered arround family enjoyment ! Not nudity or Vulgarity. Stripper content ! Nashville is a whole  Different animal to tame!  Taylor Swift thought she could take it her way ! But she killed it for her self to be truly considered a great talented country singer !  She only their because not her writing lyrics the kids like ! Not sutch a great singer at alll ! Her Stage shows have lost her way to a great country stage shows !  She has lost many country adult fans ! She's become just another copy cat of. Canny on the block and. Beyonce and. Madonna. And. Sherr stage shows ! Country has standards !  And their ageless ! ❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸☝🌟👍
sending much hate from Texas.
Hey it’s Franklin the turtle!
This is absolute trash and you should all feel bad for acting like it isn't It's just typical buzzwords thrown onto paper.
THis is the worst ever! No surprise DJs wont play it. Second rate self righteous vulgar slop. Go home Beyonce. Youre better than this.  No longer a fan!
Put a shirt on! Smh
This is terrible! So is the video! THIS IS NOT COUNTRY!! Disgusted
horrible representation of country music
this is a great song
Definitely not country  Not my favorite song from her
her best song so far... i hate her music but i listened 2 this one
If you think shes too risque for country tell Dolly. Peope are so transparent with their crappily veiled racism.
CRAP
Why didn't she just do vid- naked!?😢
Joke
This crap isn't counrty
BEYONCE just is the queen of music genres
Too commercialized, not original! She will never be a Pam Tillis, Shania Twain, Reba, Lori Morgan, or a Mindy McCready. Just like she was never a Tina Tuner! Time to cancel JayZ and his lovely wife. Too many talented underground artist who are way more unique and original that can produce, sing, dance. People are tired of seeing this mess along with all the other outdated celebrities. Just another over produced production.
I cant stand Beyonce work ,   but there is no story , it just her mindless repetitive crap r&b lyrics dressed as country, but I don’t despise this, maybe if she teamed up with a decent songwriter.
Country singer, Dutton act like that dance like that or sing like that and her dress code is nasty
A straight HOdown. Ghetto af.
What a classy joke
Love the song but it is not country
Not a fan
This is trash!
hore doing hore things and she is right -- it's not TX
🚨 "TEXAS HOLD 'EM” ultrapassou  50 milhões de streams no Spotify!  —  É a primeira música da Beyoncé a conquistar esse marco em poucos dias de contagem. O hit permanece em #2 no Top Songs Global.
A MAIOR ARTISTA DE TODOS OS TEMPOS ❤
Nah
Nope
Stupid
What a great country song.....NOTTTTTT !!!!! Nowhere near country. Put some clothes on....
woahahaha what a wonebe
I wonder if country music is gonna get a revival. I love "The Gambler" by Kenny Rogers and also the entire "O Brother Where Art Thou" movie soundtrack.  As one not too fond of current pop music or its artists, this surprised me. Good for Beyonce
Trash….
Wow you call that country I,m sorry go back to hip hop enjoy LA
Yes, this is a real hoedown, with the emphasis on "ho".  Not much difference between what we see here and the street-walkers in the bad part of town of any major city... except that Beyonce gets paid more.  This is a poor excuse for country music.  Classless.
for the streets
Video is hot f*cking garbage.  Song is mid af.
So this is country music? She is talented. No doubt. Smoking hot. No doubt. But this music video is ridiculous. Hopefully it will inspire some exotic dancers down south. That would be cool.
This is Christian is it? Yeah right and isn't this cultural appropriation? Hypocrite
Ok where are clothes?Oh hell nooooo!!!!
Black doing country doesn't work
This is awful 😂, this ain't country music
Ignorance is bliss. This isn’t country at all. The song is good. But reading ppl call it country is stupid
Well I think I would be more appreciative of this video match the story of the song. Iam not understanding the dame video 😮
Was hoping for more besides half naked . A storyline
Well that sucked
This is not a country song. It sounds more like a rap song. I know country sounds like and this is not a country song this sucked.
Ate
Culture appropriation 🖕
Her one eye symbol this don’t sound right them people ain’t going to like her bringing nudity to country
This song is horrible!
Now country music is going to shit. There is nothing country about this video.
Jellyroll remix??
Sorry girl but this def isn’t country
you sure this is country stylized?   not a fan.
As a big country fan, I have to say this song is OK, nothing too earth shattering. However, Beyoncé looks as absolutely gorgeous as ever and I couldn’t be more thrilled that she is the first black female artist to get a number 1 country song on the charts, way to go!!! ❤
Struggle with some how -  Music good- but I do miss old B seems she lost her top position in the international female category- and visual is a bit desperately seeking “shame when she has so much style and beauty that shines with out showing  so much” ✌️… x
country? this ain’t country? just cause it’s titled Texas Hold’em don’t mean it’s country. this song is pop talking about country things. it ain’t country let’s get that straight.
We need to give women more strength and independence so they can liberate themselves from evil patriarchal notion of wearing any clothes at all.
I love the song! Congratulations Bey! And if anyone doesn't think she should be doing country music, I give you Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Big Momma Thornton. " WEOUTCHEA" 🥰🥰
Wow what a piece of crap and we ALL could do with LESS hootchie!
This is kind of snappy!!!
Awful like her.
The first time I've really listened to her!😂😂😂😂😂
I'm not a Beyonce fan nor country fan and I can tell you that this is NOT country. Gtfoh 🤡🤡
I loathe country music, it's a genre that my eyes just will not tolerate...BUT this song isn't the usual twangy with stupid lyrics and intolerable music...CONGRATS Beyonce!!!!! Continue to blow the minds of all those racistwhitemaganutcases!!!!
What can I do to make myself relevant!? 🤔  I know💡 I'll do a country music song 😮
It's crap...all her music..just saying.🤷
The song great love her voice ,,& the beat of music ,but the out fit is lil undressed,,but seems now all the young ladies is showing so much skin  guess the naked bodies sells more than the music...
Fine I’ll subscribe to your channel after you’ve made a country song 😊
Sounds terrible. True country fans will laugh at that stupid shit.
I need to go listen to a real female country star to get this sound out of my head. Beyoncé is very talented ENTERTAINER but sorry country is not your cup of tea she only #1 on the chart is because of her following Sam for Taylor Swift she never really sounded like a true country singer there both pop stars
Love it love it love love love it
It’s like her and Jay got super high and are playing a joke.   lol the only good part is her costume.
This is terrible!!! 🤢🤢🤢🤡🤡🤡
Whats is it with females whobthe bat trying to figure me out boss degree  you know you on it ,,, you want to hold em and i will let them hold you ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉😢😢😅😮😮
100% not country doesn’t even sound close to country 😂
This is crap
Horrible
I'm not usually a Beyonce fan but once she she released this song I've been listening to it on a daily basis
Straight trash. Couldn't even finish it. 🤦‍♂️
Now that explains that ridiculous outfit from the Grammys. Put your tits away, this is country.
And she did it all half naked! 😂😂 garbage
🎶
Hey man them ain’t high heel sneakers…
Trash!
Excuse me! Wonderful voice, but put on some clothes, young girls look up to you!
I'm proud of Queen Bee. I love Texas hold 'em
Don't know what the fuss is about. She took a crack at it and did fine
Yeah this is ok, not adding this to the playlist yet but wouldn't change it if it came up on Spotify. Letting it grow on me
Boring
Gay
Rayquaza the heart ceremony
She opened the flood gates, won't be too long before jay z  drops a n*gga line in a country song lol
No extras dancing no extra money spent . Reuse the same clip for the whole song money be saving up
Song is catchy, but put some clothes on, please.  That's  not helping your cause.
This is some pathetic country
This is st8 disrespectful to every country artist
I love the song 😊
Love it
😂😂😂😂😂😂 seriously 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  no respect for the schlutty outfit.
What a masterpiece song queen of the music 🤗🤠😍
I can see why yt don't like this. It's great and she does not even do country 😂
Bey put in a country song in chatgpt. She's so outta touch
I like the song, but the video sucks.
😢 nuh uh
this outfit is so unfortunate
"Country" ho train 🤡😂😂😂
Meh, it's mediocre. Oh look, boobies
Watch out Taylor Beyonce entering the country scene lol
This is a stupid song and video
Pathetic that she has dress like that  to get her song exposed. Feeling insecure Beyoncé!
Was that a nip slip I saw? Geez, what's with all the boobs hanging out?
Shit song....
GARBAGE. SORRY. I LOVE BEYONCÉ BUT THIS IS NOT MY CUPPA TEA.
The greatest song I here all year ❤😅😊
another number one here we come!!!!
This ain't  Texas lol
This might be the worst song ever made
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Sorry nowhere close to country .. try again
Bin gespannt ob Yellowstone ihn verwendet
Yeah this isn’t country
I like it ❤
Trash .. sorry it the body and sex  appeal that’s all ..
😂😂
Beyonce is killing it with this!  Unfortunately, Dolly's crossover doesn't wow me like this one.
boy o boy THIS SUCKS BIG TIME  NEVER HEARD A SONG THIS BAD1
This woman can sing anything!!! Let's get this song to number one next week!!!
Country music was black people music at first! So I’m not sure why some people mad at the fact she did a country song.
amaaaaazing!!!
Used to be a huge fan but she took the piss out of Taylor swift and now she's blonde and doing country music...... hmm 😒 copying much?
I love country because it has heart and tells stories and you have to have the voice for it. I'm sorry Beyonce but your voice was trained for a different kind of music. Not everyone can sing in all genres.
Loving Beyonce country❤
Se la escuche a Lipstickfables❤❤❤
Ok i already hated country music with a passion but this trash made it clear that there is no hope for that type of music
No self respecting Country singer would wear that very revealing outfit.
SMH.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cllDgvPnHGo&ab_channel=Midnightryder3
We need a real video for this masterpiece of a song! 😍😍
Not impressed at all.
🤣
One eye covered. 🤔. Is it time for another humiliation ritual. She can sing. No doubt. But country. Idk. I don’t care either so don’t come for me. 😂
No No No... She can't sing pop or R&B, so she's trying county SMH. Girl County songs have class & moral, You're trying to sell county music  showing  less clothes wont work. County music has talent & you don't have that.
I feel like with all her other music videos she could have do so much more with this one it’s too good of a song for what’s going on here or the lack there of
Bad example of an outfit for 2024. Put some clothes on. Good country style suits your voice though.
She doesn't even sound country 😂
Franklin the turtle???
It’s sucks 🤣🤣🤣
Her video is disgusting!  Nothing to do with country music
Good song. Wish the video was better.
This cannot be the music video 😂
Horrible
Hummmm
I like the song her voice is beautiful but the outfit not so much 😅
Well she is from Texas....
I have always been a fan of Beyonce' . She is so talented. Everything that she does is perfection. Personally, I am beyond thrilled that she dipped her talents into this genre. Everyone was all in an uproar when Jelly Roll broke into county and y'all gave him awards. Queen B is going to do what she always does. These newer female country artists could learn a thing or two. Way to go Beyonce'.❤❤❤❤
I know this might sound a little odd but this song kinda makes me laugh
Beyoncé is bringing back sexy and country woman power❤ .
Why in the world and to take this long U 2 a Country Song 🎶 maybe bBeyoncé will bring back line dancing ❤ . I have a nice clogging dancing beat to it . I bet it sounds like 150 beats good workout . Go Beyoncé . ❤
The most cliche country song ever written for the dummest of listers ever. If you are upset it’s because it’s true.
Not country music.
Just horrendous. Stay in your lane Bey. R&B is where you belong!
70 YO listener. Really like this song & Beyonce.
Trashy song and trashy video.
This isn't country. This is pop.
I like this song, but I wish she would put some clothes and a cowgirl hat on!
Love it! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like the song but why is the video so hoe-ish?
I wanted to watch it and hear the song for the 1st time and I just did, it sucks!
I wouldn’t consider this country it sounds more like bluegrass than country
Is there some kind of hidden message in this video?  How many times its repeat this loop? What seconds she fire?
Is this Franklin the Turtles beat...
This is trash
Is this the actual video, it's trash ...half your breast out.. come on...make a real video with some story...not some cheap sexual crap.
okay, “Texas Hold ‘Em” grew on me, and I. Love. It. So. Much. It’s giving line dance. Helllllo. 🤠💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
This ant country
❤
If Beyoncé is country then I’m country
Country doesn’t suit her. It‘s ridiculous. She did country dirty
Hold on, is this it in terms of visuals? Excuse my ignorance yall, just want more than this repetetive visual...  Song is banging though
this shit mid lmfaoooo glaze her harder💀💀
SHITTY ASS SONG!!!! WTF IS THIS TRASH 🤣🤣🤣
Idolatry will land you all in hell. Stop glorifying regular human beings like you and I. Singers are good at singing just like builders are good at building God gave us all talents but you dont see people glorifying the architects that built your homes or the people that designed your cars even though those abilities are far more impressive than singing. We've lost touch with what's truly important in life. Thanks to the Idolatry, we are teaching our youths, the next generation only want to be youtubers or actors instead of engineers and builders. Nothing is to be worshipped other than Jesus. We throw millions of dollars to singers, actors, athletes and pay, builders, masons, roofers, a mediocre pay but have you asked yourself which one is more important and which one we can live without?
a breakout style, and it showcases her voice in a fresh way. i like it.
Go naked mom song 🎵 ok .
This is not country lol
This is so out of touch for the audience your trying to get to.
Honestly Beyonce is an amazing singer but this just doesn't work its like luke Bryan or Chris young doing rap doesn't sound right.
If this is country the fiery place down below has officially frozen
Pure trash! Stick to pop music! Plus this is cultural appropriation, you never been in the county…😂😂😂
Gotta love it when black people have to say oh blacks created this and that😂 who gives a shit. You dont see white people in sports comments saying white people created this lmao. We are all human who cares what skin tone you have holy shit.
Love this song would love beyonce to do a country music album x
Why are people acting like this is Beyonce first rodeo 😂 she has done country music before
The country community does not accept your choice of outfit.
Adding a banjo and attempting a southern accent does not make it country.   Just pop music with a banjo.  SMFH   Go listen to some Sturgil
So years ago nashville powers were up in arms that Shania Twain was showing her belly button? Granted Beyonce did at least cover up her belly button.😂😂😂😂🤣
Why she got to be half naked
Major Record label: Would you sing country for millions?  Beyonce:
Right back ain’t cheatin🤷🏽‍♂️
...to each his/her own...
All of the backup singer parts should be removed
It’s not anything new, it’s just straight up pandering
Horrible
TRASH!!!!
It's cool when artists try new stuff. But no.
Did SHE wrote the song? Doubt it
I got that Cowboy Hat on 😂😂😂😂
Awesome Beyonce🥰❤️🔥🔥
I guess this is an ok line dancing song but, is it really country? I mean she not runnin from da law, her man (likely her brother/cousin/uncle) aint dun left her, and all her animules is still livin, so...???
Good pop tune. Wouldn’t go as far as to label it country music but a lot of today’s country is mostly pop music.
Not a fan. but of course I admit she is racist. So, not thanks
gotta capture that white demographic somehow
this aint no country music its pop music with real instruments for a change !!!
Song lover of both R&B and Country tooo! But this wardrobe aint it or matching this great song....What trailride is she suppose to be going to in this outfit? Call me a hater whatever..but also what message are we sending to our country brown girls ......I'm country just like Beyonce born in the same city and state and we country girls like our boots, (Daisy Dukes)short shorts, dresses, and pants. We don't go nowhere like this..This ain't Texas it's definitely given a Hoe down drag vibe....Florida country maybe.idk..I'm just not feeling this outfit. I appreciate that she has money to tune up and keep herself together but real Country girls don't mind having spreaded hips with a little dip 👢👢and getting their hands dirty. She been in New York too long.
Horrible, this ain’t country 🤦‍♂️
Aww look at the non country fans only liking one country song because it's Beyonce. THIS song is amazing, but baby if you can't make a video line dancing to this, you're not finna make me love you because you don't know country, if you did, you sure don't anymore.
Shit whack… very basic … but the beehive gonna make it thrive no doubt … this song gonna be in a movie soon … forcefully put on us …
Trash
This ain’t Country Music. You can like it, to each their own. It still isn’t country music and no her skin color doesn’t have anything to do with it.  This is RnB with a fake twang . I’ll pass on this
There is a very nice challenge in tiktok. People dancing this song country style. Cool ❤
This sounds like a song written by AI
If country singers can cross over to pop, then pop singers can cross over to country. And I’m all about it! 🔥
My ears are bleeding...this is trash and a joke to country music
This is anything but country.
Songs ok. The visualizer however is gross and in bad taste. She could do so much better.
Never heard the "sh*t" word in genuine country, never saw someone showing their breasts like this... but I'm old school country and if this is the direction country is gonna go, then I'm never gonna like it. Catchy beat is about all I can say about it. It could be a pop song.
Love the song now after seeing all the line dance reels. 😂 I'm ready to boogie n 🤠 howdy but this visual is terrible. Cmon now out on a shirt Bey a lace one with a brassiere underneath something 😂. Gotta come in nice n slow not bare chested 😂😆 saying take that take that ijs😂
From a very long term C&W fan and follower; this is PURE S#!T.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
This is garbage and is not country music.  🖕🏻
Call me a hater but I’m not feeling it… now if Franklin and his friends were singing instead  ☄️🔥😂
Watched half way and clicked off.  First thing you notice is it's Very symbolic for her handlers.
I call this BULLSHIT! THIS AINT COUNTRY just CHEAP TRASH!
Really good - be perfect for dance teams but need a cleaned up version - not a prude but you know parents
Ona pokazuje znak bahometa ( bahomet) 👹 czyli szatana. Dwa palce w górze - jedna ręka i dwa palce w dole - druga ręka.
This is worse than Dolly trying to do rock and roll. smfh
C'mon, get serious.....this ain't no country happening, whata worthless uninspiring hoe down.
This is hilarious 😂 and why she half naked with a “finger gun”?
This is some bull sh!#@!! First, Beyonce is as country as Taylor Sift's ass... If Taylor can switch it up, from country to pop or whatever category she's claiming  today, then Beyonce should have that same opportunity. Let music be Universal!!!
Ohhhh dear…
This isn't country, i don't know what it is, but it ain't country.  Crapola
Me: "Yeah I like Beyoncé but I'm more a fan of country and folk"   Also me: "OH 🤩"
Have some self respect.  Put some clothes on.
Momma always said, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.......
If she don’t do a music video with visuals of the Dance trend then I don’t wanna see it 😂😂😂
Omg❤🇧🇷
It's not country. She forgot her shirt.
Not my cup of tea or whiskey, smh.
I like it, a lot. Sounds like Beyoncé with a twist.
What a mockery of country music 😅 she should stick to what she knows. We’d respect her more.
disturbing
I’m confused not accustomed to hearing Beyonce sing this genre..
That is not country , barely covered boobs made it what it is
I can't believe how many people like this. It is garbage and definatly NOT COUNTY.
That's not country
Yaas!  Levelling the playing field.  What now?  "Tell the Grammys ##$$ that 0 for 8 ish."
I hate it. This is not country. And there's cursing. The visuals is obscene. Country sounds like Sturgill Simpson not this pop song that says Texas. Saying Texas and talking about a bar doesn't make it country music actually.This is "country" only if you've never actually listened or liked or loved or lived country music and lifestyle. More studio garbage. The best country you'll ever here is by the people you never heard of actually born and raised in the country giging in backwoods and bayou bars. This ain't it.
Beyonce is the best,even not really a country music fan,except for The Mavericks and Garth Brooks..
❤
2024
Long time country fan here. It’s pretty catchy. Gonna add it to my playlist. 😁
She will need to do better or get back in her own lane. As a compton cowgirl we dont dress like that either, not necessary.
I don't understand the video! 🤷🏻‍♀️
can t say I  like her coyboy outfit
This is one of the worst "country" songs I have ever heard.
Beyonce is the goat I'm happy to have learned da roots of country music because it came from us black slavery. This is song is great go head bee
Look like I listenning to Benjamin the turtle. Wtf !😂
Trash
Culture Vulture
To each their own, but I don't like this.
She's still bitter that Taylor Swift came from country to Beyonces backyard and stole all her spotlight. So she thinks she's rich enough to pull the uno reverse card and do the same thing.   But how about trying to stick to the sound of the genre for once? You can't just change evert fundamental thing about a specific genre and just say that's what it is cause you got some words in there like hoedown..   If a country song says bitches and Hos does that suddenly make jt an rap song?
Love the song so much. But I'm hoping for a better music video for it ❤
bro this is trash no way people are listening to this
Country is the only genre of music that has allowed culture rot to rape it into something unrecognizable.  The country genre is dead and gone.
Queen Bee love it, but I need the radio edit❤❤❤
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY BY ANY MEANS. sad day when Americans think this is country, what's happening
Wish my boobs were perfect like that.. . Lol
She should make a real country song. This is just a cheap attempt to do what Taylor Swift did and change genres for clout.
This is terrible stick to r&b Illuminati queen. They don’t want ya evil in the country world.
I think this song is horrible. She shouldn't stick to country music and I am not really fan of country music
Langweilig wenn immer nur Sex sells gelten soll. Finde ich nicht gut😝😝😝😝
This is just a pop song with country lingo put into it 🤮
This isn't country. This is straight trash. Not one bit of this is even close to fitting what country is, and has been. It's a mockery to the artists who grew up on farms, in the back woods playing on the porch and pouring heart, soul, and emotion into their music. Beyonce has never been, and never will be.
She is the GREATEST!!!! Can make any kind of music sound good. I’m not a 🐝 fan but music is music to me and it sound great
Put some clothes on
I'm not a Beyonce fan but I really like this song...Great job!!
Is this the song video??? Can't be. Why so low budget?
More Mumfordy than anything. 🤔
Now have a listen to Franklin the turtles theme song! 😂
Why does she feel she needed to be half naked? To promote it? Being well dressed is not out of style.
New fashion being baked in your videos  When you trade with the devil
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING
It's a no for me. That's a poor country song. 😅
the song is great but there is no need for Beyonce to wear this vulgar outfit… refer to Madonna in her cowboy moment, she wore a simple shirt and pair of jeans, it was damn sexy😅
Called being a poser.
Disgusting porn video and nothing country about it
This isn't country..
the song isn't bad but the way she is dressed is not country
If thats country, I got some ocean front property for sale in Arizona
Yee Haw. If you want to live HEALTHY take my course!
When u hate country music but Bey makes it 🔥
In what alternate dimension is this considered country?
Uninspired and dull.
Oh look a black billionaire putting on white face and appropriating white culture
Like it 👍
Trash
Why everyone hating ? I enjoyed it pretty well.
So if she didn't come out selling her body to America would anyone really like this song? Is this music or PLayboy?
This is country…. 🤣🤣 yeah right. Too much for me.
take easy
Hey, Franklin!
Esto no es country !!! Sólo una porquería pegadiza que por ser Beyoncé está en primeras listas.
This is horrible. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Love you forever girl❤
Absolutely the dumbest song. What the heck is she thinking?
Lot of these folks have no clue what country is and this ain’t country music at all this woman used sexuality porn and fan base to make this song get lot of views cuse this ain’t country music like how the f is there a tornado in the basement, says and her song makes no sense this shouldn’t be number one my homie chayce Beckham this guy country music way better than Beyoncé this woman should just stick to regular hip hop
I don’t get the video?
Ms Beyonce never fails to amaze me
who's here from YouBetcha Radio?
Do not like this at all!
lol
Why.. I mean why.. there's enough pop country.
This song might have saved our local line dance bar from dying 😢.
Wytppl really mad at this bop I hope she do a video with a squaredance routine 😅😂😂😂 I'm a play it again🔥
Garbage
Put some clothes on.
overrated
TRASHY! Thus is awful. All she is doing is trying to make country music as trashy as hip hop. Garbage. I am so disappointed. Please do not give her air time on the country stage
what a load of sh*t
Looks like an outer space hooker with a banjo theme song.
We country music lovers are getting more fans via queen Beyonce💃💃 🕺🕺
WTF is this stupidity?
Beyonce is gorgeous,  voice perfection, but the video is boring, song just  ok.
Nah - true country has real videos - she can't compare to Chapel Hart
We can do without the boobs, it's so sad that today's females feel like they have to show everything.
Ok this isn’t country though 🤷🏼‍♀️
Song and video are simply repetitive.  Easy to dance to, but that’s all.
Her worst,  I'm sorry. 😢
I like Beyonce but she is not a country singer... For people to say that they are not a fan of country music and like this song , then ya don't know country... This song only made it to number one because of who is singing it... Jelly Roll is way better than Beyonce...
Terrible and put clothes on....
Terrible, not country & put some clothes on,
Shocked? Why their Genre has been destroyed by Auto tuning and bad music but Hey  Country Is God Country and Family and If Hootie can be big here so can Beyonce unfortunately Country already has enough Queen Bs
This is a great song but this is not country music. This Pop music with a banjo inserted into the instrumental. Just because she is from Texas and says a couple relatable words doesn't make her country.
People thinking this is country 😂 Election year, nice try Beyonce
Why was there a need to call someone a b!@#$ and cuss in this song? It is so sad that Beyonce decided to taint this song with that language and then dress this way. Her music can't even be played with children listening. This carnal society where any and everything is acceptable will ultimately experience the consequences sooner than later.😢
Country is our music you culture vultures need to stick to yo rap crap.. or is this what we get for adam calhoun  tom macdonald and Upchurch taking over the rap game
Beyoncé still beautiful and hot. Been beautiful for 20+ years.
it's excellent
This is the biggest load of crap I've seen in year.
Everybody talking bad about this song. They are 100% right. She's crusty.
Always loved country music but this hits different 2024 ❤️loving all of it-can’t wait for more #Queen Bee - Beyoncé
I see her as a great country singer regardless of her skin color! Just like I do Charlie  Pride and Jason Aldean! Beyonce  did terriffic with rhis song!
Eh.
I’m sorry this song is trash in my opinion I am not a big fan of her but like some of the songs she sings but this isn’t one
Hmmm, wonder what ppl think of this. It’s more a nod to the genre not an actual transition to the genre unless a real video is yet to come. Should have cowboy shit on, cowboy hat, country shit, trucks, if it’s about poker maybe some saloon poker stuff. This look ain’t it, but the bazookas out okay
OMG NO NO NO . 😮 Go back and stay in your Genre please.
Nope nope nope sorry dont like the video or song that not a country song
Catchy song.  Sex always sells and always will.
Not country.
Good for Beyoncé. She hasn’t had a hit in a long time or just a likable commercial song in a long time. And the extreme hate she gets, I’m glad she’ll get a #1. Cute song.
This is a insult to country music this more mest up then when she did that black panther shit
Skank
I only came here to see how to do the dance 😫 this video sucks Bey! How we supposed to know what it's really supposed to look like if you don't show it!? Tf
Everyone excited to see some transsexual show some cleavage?
I work in vision center at my local Walmart.  Been there a few months and they have they own radio.  Walmart radio.  When I realized they weren’t playing your music I started talking about it out loud cause who doesn’t play Beyoncé.  You put this song out … in a few days it was playing on Walmart radio inside the store!!! 🫶🏼🫶🏼🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 when I realized … lol oh my gosh it made my day! ILY thank you for the music! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I heard this song yesterday I was like what the heck like something finally different in the world a really nice sound
I don’t feel this is country. It’s more Americana. It is pretty good though! If you like this sound, give Alison Russell a listen to
I don't even know what to say except I am truly astonished that this actually works. Great song Beyonce🔥🔥🔥
Excellent song (bit of a Dolly Parton touch); however, the video needs cleaning up.
It’s not “country”…. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Not country
Not impressed.  Song is OK, but the rest, I expected AN ACTUAL performance, not just her baby bottles.  She has SO much more talent than this
They said whore down. Did she fall?
I think the queen ofcountry music is probably like Loretta Lynn or somebody.. maybe Dolly Parton.. I don't know I kind of like male country singers..
This song sucks.  I had hoped for better from her.  I'm sure she can get there.
It took me until the 1:43 mark to notice the video was on repeat 😂
Why do it just keep repeating the same shot? She could have done so much more for this music video!
I hope she gets a country music award so Ed Sheeran can run on stage and be like "IMMA LET YOU FINISH BUT...."
I don't get it.. this doesn't sound like a country singer.. she's got a good voice but not country voice.. and I really think the wardrobe is not appropriate.. I think everyone's afraid to say anything. But they might look bad.. but this is not tasteful or appropriate
Mucho no han invertido en el video 🙄
Stupid video, not much creativity
Totally haven't listened to this 26 times in a row, not me.
I don't like it. Too much cussin' and half naked! Sorry just not my thang!
Congratulations 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆to #Beyonce & your man #,Jay-Z sean carter 😄😅🎸🎹❤🎵
This is not country... shameful
🗑️
I’ve 4 kids and dressing like this is absolutely ridiculous, I was going to let my kids under 6 see this song , How is this woman a mother , very disappointed!!!
You guys do understand this isn’t country right? This is pop
Oh shit! She’s got something good here. I’m all about country and damn Beyoncé sure did it.
It's just a black woman singing country she knows nothing about!! Wearing trashy clothes while singing about poor people. Truly classy 😂😂
I love it.. let me go buy a cowboy hat lol
Country music is not all about being sexy. I like the song when I heard it on the radio  version better then this one. I think you should  stay the  music you know best.
Well, it's 2024 and Beyonce has finally done something I don't mind hearing.
K…Please DONT Pounce on me for my Honest Feelings here BUT a Couple spots she could’ve carried it to a HIGHER OCTIVE …Just saying and Muffles her words in a couple spots, but that’s my two cents and I’m NOT BEING A B***H❤And as for the Music Video…ugh huh…if ya like waiting to See👀👀👀👀👀👀…Well , You know…But it dose have a GoodBeat❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂oh and this IS my Very First Beyoncé Song I’ve ever listened to…K Moving along…Have a GREAT DAY Everybody 💜💚❤️💗🤎💙🩵🧡💛🩷⛄️⛄️⛄️⛄️⛄️⛄️⛄️
❤74
Nice song. Easy to listen and sing along. Just like a lot of country music, I like the melody
Lmao. This is dumb. Stay in your lane B.
I like the song but the video,  not a fan. Everyone thinks they have to be half naked these days to sell a song.
Not much to it. Guess she’s depending on her boobs to do the trick.
Not country.  Sad.
Loving Beyoncé’s country era!
I always feel so weird after listening to her music. Very catchy tune…love it!…but I just feel weird
Love it.  Way to go QB
👎🏾 It's a no for me 😩
This isn't country..this is what not being popular in pop music anymore gets you
SUCKS!!
This is a gumbo soup video. The video didn't go with song. They weren't sure if they wanted a young B or a teenager B but ended up with a halfway naked Beyonce.  This  video was like watching someone trying to make soup and gumbo mixed together. 😮😂😮🤔😂😮🤷🏽‍♀️
Not country music and surly that’s not a country outfit 😂
I like it. She sounds good
This is just pandering smut country.
Not a bad song but it’s more pop country than country
Not a fan of… not country
That's not country! It's amazing how many people are like a fish in a stream and chase the same shiny spinner!
She has a beautiful voice but this is not country.
This is TRASH and the video is Uncomfy
Plagiarism ! "Francklin melodie"😅
That sucked she sexy though
What a crappy video to an otherwise good song...
Is this all AI generated?
my daughters are in love with this song😂❤🎉
Texas Born
achei essa música tão melódica e agradável.
So we still doing Hip hop, but just slapping the country label on it… that’s all I hear
No thank you .. I would rather see her do more acting. But this is a no-go for me ... She needs to stay relevant I get it..
Not country and far from it
This isn't country.
31 athletic country Queen Tut w/ locs looking for my country Nefertiti
This is actually a good song 💁🏻‍♀️ I’m not a 🐝 either-important to add lol
This sounds like a song they play in a black American movies at a barbecue on the weekend with a lot of cousins that don't really like each other but pretend to coz the food and music is just too good for bad vibes
Five times I watched her walk and I'm bored. It's not gonna win best country video because it sucks!
I’m just glad she is pro finger gun.  But she needs some clothes on.  What is wrong with people?
Must sex always be in the mix and for sale by modern female music artist?  What happened to the Whitney Houstons or the Sades?
Not great but not bad either. Let’s see a whole album, sing about our country, our troops our flag and our culture and values.
Sounding very nice proud of you😊
There needs to be more or this country music. Great stuff.
Nope. Catchy but lame and will never last.
This is the only thing I refused to copy from USA but i guess I gotta give in, I like country now 😂😂😂
This video is literally like 15 seconds on repeat and I’m nervous with every step. This was a missed opportunity though.
Well played about 40 seconds of that couldn't take it no more. This right here is not country.
This is a hydrid composition consisting of country, pop, and a little rock.  It is definitely not pure country, but uses country concepts and themes in the lyrics and in the video. She definitely knows how to use her body to get views and promote marketing. In general, I like it.❤
I don’t understand why u feel like u have to be half naked to do a country song. Who attention u trying to attract the devil because he already got u and most definitely u ant getting God attention he nowhere in this mess go get some where and sit yourself down and get some real country music because this ant it u missed it on this one. Go get on your face and pray that God birth some real prophetic songs to u, oooh 😮my bad u can’t because u ant on your face for real enough to allow God to. Go get save for real SELAH
WTG Nashville's Corporate Music Machine, never ashamed to pretend some bad click track song is great country music if they get paid off.
Not me repeating this straight banger all morning in the pickup line 😂
Disgusting outfit is how she made it.
Not country. Want real country listen to Reba or Patty Loveless. Not impressed.
One eye symbolism, covered by a snake- repeating the Baphomet pose- dressed like a skank,
its boring
She no country she needs to stay in her lane !
As a country song. This is hot garbage. If this wins any award in the space, the industry is broken. Sounds like a scene song in a Pixar movie.
ass
Why does she or anyone think that's COUNTRY music.
Always thought Beyonce is overated just like swift.... However, here I am watching this video.  Fml
They couldn't come up with any more ideas on the video?
the entire video is the artist all glammed up with lots of skin showing?  is that country now?
0:35 "A real life ho down"   Yep she has that correct.  Dresses like one, sounds like one.
I like the song.  Video makes no sense. But this isnt country.   Country lyrics, but not country music.   😊
well done
this is NOT country...just a strip tease show!!  What a  SHAME!!
In the immortal words of Hank the 3rd, pop country really sucks.
As a fellow female singer / musician with many genre influences... she did good on this one.
Love it!
Not sure how that made it to the top don’t sound country at all. Popularity should not earn a top chart spot. This song is bs and dumb
Nice, catchy tune, but girl, show some dignity. You are beautiful without showing so much boob. No the kind of role model I would want for my granddaughter. You are too talented to diminish yourself like this.
The song is ok but I don’t like her dressing so trashy
Franklin?
Laziest attempt at a music video I've ever seen.
This song is garbage
Song was ok.  Not great 7.5.  Video was a 1.  Absolutely terrible.  She's beautiful so a 2 I guess, but no thought.  0 effort.  Nothing that goes w the song besides gun fingers.  Even that.  Not synched with song.  Walk wasnt syned.  Literally just I'm sext.  Look at me.  I dont have to try anymore.  Pathetic for such a star.
I love this song so much
Disappointing video, no lyrics, but it made it on the charts because of the catchy beat.  She can do so much better.
Love it Bey....go gal❤
Sounds like something that Nathaniel Rateliff wrote for her https://youtu.be/1iAYhQsQhSY?si=wR8VjPMD-WpH3P6u
She is really wrapped up on herself.
This sucks lol
Is this the ORIGINAL  video?? Because if so, Beyonce has a bloated sense of self!¡!¡  Song was GREAT!! She looks STUNNING!!!! She isnt trying to infiltrate country music . The lady IS SOUTHERN!! She has always had a clear accent or drawl.  I look forward to hearing more.
Best Beyonce song in years!
I have been enjoying country since 1982 And what I can tell you is. This is definitely not country. pop , maybe soul, but definitely not country definitely not for me
The world needs more of that right now 🫶🏼
😂😂😂 nope
The country aint country, no more.
Apparently, this song has taken over Tik Tok with people posting videos of various line dances to the track.  Brilliant!
This isnt country music.
Potty mouth Beyoncé.
Trash
Yo eww I wish I liked it but can't vibe this song it's number 1 that's sad lmao
https://youtu.be/BCAX2lQbEjA?si=XYo7uVI2j0hrP152
Is good to hear 👂 a guitar 🎸
😂funny shit
To funny 1st minute is just her doing same thing and not even singing CUTE SONG BUTTTTTTT GET TO SINGING DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN WALK UP USE 2 fingers like a gun
Just when u thought country music couldn’t get any worse
Carnage
No please stop. Let’s start telling the truth. Nothing country about this just the beat
😂😂😂
It’s not country. It’s pop. It’s bad music .
Nice jugs
I’m not a Beyoncé fan per se, but this song is good. I’m a big country fan. This woman is beautiful and her voice is good enough that she doesn’t always need to have her T&A hanging out. It’s too bad she doesn’t understand that.
Fuck... i like it..
SO PRETTYYYY
Why is she dressed like a street walker, as usual?
The problem with mainstream music. Try to cram 2 genres of musiic together and come out trash. Oh ya, love the one eye symbolism. Bunch of clowns
Bixa linda
Love it!! Also think she could nail a reprised role of 7 of 9 in a Star Trek Voyager series revamp or as the Bog Queen in a movie!! Love this!
Sucks
Bad video with a ok song
This is a good song, but needs to clean her act up a little. It gives Young girls the impression that being half naked gets you places. This isn't,t the country way of doing things.
Awful. This is not authentic country music. Just a silly tune.
It’s different, so bizarre to hear a soulful voice sing along to banjo like music. I don’t know yet, I love country, , not my fav but I have a few artists I like. She’s like if I can’t get wreck of the year I’ll try for country music awards
Its folk
I'm sorry I'm not a country music fan but that's just awful, about the worst I've ever heard. I like Beyonce but she needs to stick with her genre as country isn't it.
Where is the funko?
Love the song,  hate the outfit
Why does she have to wear such provocative suit?😮
Horrible the lyrics are Country but the sound is not.
Who else can hear the gunshots? 😮
What makes this a country song and not a pop song
Damn Beyoncé! Her voice still isn’t meant for country .
Cultural appropriation, if the term ever made sense, this is it
A mockery of country music!   🗑️
THIS. IS. NOT. FUCKING. COUNTRY.
Trash 😂😂😂😂
She made another masterpiece....
THIS SONG REALLY SUCKS,  she doesn't have a country hit here. Sorry
omg for some reason country just got way hotter
I say no
Saying country words don’t make it country. This is stupid.
Country R&B hybrid. Don't be a bitch take it to the floor now. Love it.
Ben doing rap was far superior to her trying to do country
The way my son hopped up out of his sleep bc he thought Franklin was on 😂🤣
ummm..
Well I can say that this is not what I expected.
Yikes. Sounds about right if someone told me Beyoncé made a country song.
Hmmm
So it looks like this will be an unpopular opinion but this song is pretty much crap. There is absolutely no message to it.
Now y'all can stfu about Tom MacDonald killing rap and hip hop. Yelling it's cultural appropriation...if a white boy raps you can finally be quiet about it. Beyonce wearing blonde wigs and doing country could be considered the same but I truly don't give a F. Beyonce was trash as a country singer here.
She ain't no Taylor 😂
I don't really like this song, it's just over hyped. Anyway lemme see what Selena Gomez song will sound like later today. I hope both of them won't be a NO from me
She cusses more in this song than any song I’ve ever heard her sing. Yeah it’s country🙄
She’s doing this to tread on Taylor and show how easy country music is to hit in. But I think the song sucks personally
I wouldn't classify this country in the traditional sense, more like a mash up, but it's not bad
Won't be long until there's a line dance for this
Someone lied to her
If you know country music this is not it. Because the title is TEXAS Hold ‘em ??? Geez 🙄 The outfit where are your clothes, the gun fingers with smoke what is that?  What happened to good music videos. bye Beyonce.
Why do these pop "stars" always have to be so trashy? I guess music isn't enough. You have to show tits to grab people's attention.
Nice song. Keep seeing people saying it's garbage  and it's far from that. She sounds  really good singing it. Nice song B
Imagine if was using a stoned white cowboy hat 😮😮😮
Ole skool banjo hoedown.   I see your move gal
Better then all her other stuff this that old Beyonce sound especially the parts when she says down down down and round round round this that classic Beyonce yall Better watch out!
She’s Talented as hell but this isn’t going to win you Album of the Year  Who told her this would be a good idea ? Love B but this not hitting
Everyone saying this is a great Country song? What is so great about it? It sounds basic af to me… please state facts only in the replies 😅
She trying to compete with Swift.  But the song is good.
Trash
Tits sell
Is that a patch on her eye, why?
This shit wack af!!!
Oh God this is awful.... what in the pan handle is going on...
I don’t like all the “whew” and kitschy background mess.  It sounds like a song making fun of country music instead of actual country music.
This is like going to your fridge to get a drink in the middle of milk in the middle of the night just to find out it went bad after taking 2 big gulps
This isn't country music
Meh, and what's with the boring looping video ?
She's got a hit definitely
What a surprise! I actually love her singing Country.
Nope
Line dancers everywhere be like, Hell Yes 🤠🤠🤠
Lame by Industry standards
What rubbish song
Song is catchy, but this video and outfit is a terrible choice.
This sucks. Stay in ya lane Beyoncé.
Definition of growth. When u grown u gata change the style of music
Worst country song ever. This is bullshit
Plastic fantastic... so what. Nothing special
Keeping it black is keeping it real. She’s really stretching into our peoples background, black history is being revived in this girl! Don’t just listen to the music understand it.
Sounds like trash
This song blows
Novo álbum pra perder novamente o Grammy para Taylor. Perder Grammy em todas categorias musicais ,
Beyonce is showing us that u dont have to be a white girl for be a queen and rocking  in waters of white people she killing so much better
This song or should I say video is insulting to country music. Put some clothes on please.
The language is kind of nasty. It comes off as a defiant mockery. A weird appropriation from a wealthy yet bitter bully.   I don't care for her singing voice, here or elsewhere. She only has one shaky note, and when she ventures to other notes, she needs additional harmonies or electronic effects to mask the weakness.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 trash
It is a Ho Down. Madonna was said to not qualify for Rock N Roll and yet Beyonce puts on white hair, a 10-gallon hat, cursing to notes, so-called music video with this black leather-revealing costume with breast exposure that just hits the line before indecent, puts on a holster with a thong, simulates her gun smoked fingers and it is called Country Music?  Good that we all have freedom of choice. Makes one appreciate Amadeus.
She’s so gross.
Props to her plastic surgeon. Well done.
This song simply sucks! Not Country at all. Her writers failed her on this song.
Pure shit
Beyonce listened to a couple Charlie Daniels and John Denver songs and came up with this bullshit hahaha.
If it wasn't Beyonce and she wasn't "un"dressed like this in the video, nobody would give this song a second listen - it has nothing to offer..
If a song is good, it will appeal to people without curse words and partial nudity. The video seems to be selling sex rather than the music.
If anyone is really country, this isn't even close to it, Beyonce needs to stick to her original music which sounds better!! This just isn't it
Did she say there's a tornado in my titty😅
No. I am not someone who grew on country but evven i have to say. NO... WHEH I COME TO PAIN TO RELATE. COUNTRY IA PURE TO ME AND ROCK AND THIS IS NOT THAT.    NOTHING COUNTRY SHE'S JUST TAKING MONEY NOW AND NEED TO LET IT GO
😂😂😂😂 not country but it was a nice try.😢
Boy she sure whored that up. If people think this is country music. Then music has taken a turn for the worse. Put some clothes on Beyonce and wash your mouth out with soap. My teen daughters won't watch this trash!
Ppl like this?
Omg this is the best gift I never even thought to f’ing ask for!!!!!  Hate being asked what music I like… rap.. country… nothing else. Not even going to ask if that’s weird now! 😭😄🤗
La esperaba bailando
That’s not country.crap
Doesn’t win album of the year… copies the style of the winner 👀
This is not country. Its pollution of an audio nature.
Hot gahbage like all her other music lmao
Beyonce, and her damn hot sauce!!!
😮, what are we gonna do with the QUeen of Texas?!?! Earning a purple 💜 strip is mega Hard!!! You know royal colors, Oprah
Hmmm! Sounds like theft again!! Pretty odd that Tyler Reese Tritt comes out with "Texas Hold Him" and down the line you come out with this Texas Hold Em song with sh!t lyrics!! Sounds like you got some hate going on to go out of your way to do this ;) Obvious much!
Taylor Swift killing it so bad its making Beyonce go to whole another genre of music acting like Kim K just to stay relevant after that Grammy cringefest 😅😅😅 She doesn't write her own music and her songs are l Elementary for her tier 3 simps
She didn't even write any of this, and this song is not country. This is what city people think country music is hahahhaha
So she's no longer making music videos?...
She should go country but take out dirty words😂
Mickey Guyton, Tierra Kennedy, and Brittney Spencer are better than Beyonce.. Black people created County Music..
The only reason why she’s doing this is because of Taylor swift she’s jealous of her real bad
❤❤❤
She hasn't got a country voice. The musicians and backing singers make a difference.
Country music has always some substance and nice lyrics…. It was nice to try anyway B
I didn’t expect to like this
Stupidest video I’ve ever seen but I like the song
Kylie did it better years ago
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT COUNTRY MUSIC.
Why wear the jacket … she shouldn’t have worn pants either and showed the world her beaver 😂😂😂😂 What a stupid video 😂😂
Possibly the most non country country song of all time.
Pathetic excuse for white girl music. No support.
The world has come to and end… not bad, but million miles away from nr1… it’s only nr1 because of the name…
Really good song but exposing yourself like that got to go.😊
Ahh yeaa na
Black people always ripping off white people... Jesus Christ it never ends
Too bad Beyoncé can’t afford a top? What is this showing YOUNG girls, not Self Respect. That’s a shame 🫣
These people don't understand Frenchy's, R.J's Rib Joint and the Jack Yates Lions in the Astrodome.
BORING Really? The same flipping 10 sec video of her boobs over and over and over and over .... The song sucks, too.
Ya. I didn’t need to see that. 😕
Cross burning music.
I’m guessing nine song writers ‘wrote’ this unadulterated crap
Hope they never play her on country radio. Its horrible.
Terrible clothes, whose stupid idea was this?!
This song is not #1 material. It's just ok! I've heard better country than this.
What is the purpose of this video......................great song
This just don’t give me country music vibes just cause you use a old country beat and put some words like boogie and hoe down it just don’t make it country but I’m  fan not hating just my opinion from someone who grew up listening to all kinda genres lol hate me or don’t I didn’t see nobody else saying it
Please explained her choice of clothing! .??????????😵‍💫🥶🤢🤣👏🏾👏🏾❤
Ok like the song but this “video”…needs more video
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bring it on home B❤
This is actually the worst song ive ever heard. Please stop making "music."
She should stay away from country music I love country music but this is 🗑
How lazy is this music video ahahahahah
Hell ya!  Bout time B come out swinging and put Tay Tay back on her flat no talent butt!    Love the new song
What the fuck is this and is this video 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not a fan at all, I gave her too many chances, a mediocre artist. Legs like 2 trunks, tacky for gay population yes. For normal women, Jesus Christ cover yourself up, embarrasing 😂
This is not country music & she need so clothes on.
You like the song or the visualizer lmao
❤❤❤❤❤
The Queen B is going to be top of the world with this one ❤️ you got to get album of the year 🌹👑🌹🙏
Looking as a w. hore like always
Delete it . 👎🏽
How is this country music? It is just another Pop song with a country twist by the great Beyonce but nothing else.
This isn't country. This is foul mouthed pop music.
I'm not a huge country fan and this song/video has NOT convinced me. NOTHING country about Beyonce. Bringing ghetto to the genre. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
The most lazzy videoclip I have see from 1990 until now! Sex & Guns for what? 🤔 She promovate to killing people? 🙄
absolutely heard that before nothing special and quite simple but ofcourse because is beyonce has to be the best whatever whenever
Beyonce this song isn't country and country songs don't have vulgar language in it. Plus country singers dress classier than you did in video.
Franklin Theme Song! 😂
Can we reintroduce modesty to the modern world.   Please.  These kids are so lost
lol why do people like her when there are so many talented black female musicians. Americas are so desperate to like anything that someone else likes they like this garbage.
Waiting for a wardrobe malfunction. It s gotta.happen one of these times😂😮 Great song, love Beyonce from TX
Beyoncé is the greatest country singer of all time, no debate
Not your typical country but I do like it and she looks great!
oh yeah there's too much wholesome going on in country, let's culture it up, 😢
Disgusting, she’s a mom! Sorry to see this
I just don't like her anymore, I used to like her older music, when it was Destiny's child but I just can't anymore, it's like she's everywhere being shoved in our faces, ugh, just my opinion
BLACK COUNTRY??!!,Yahoo! Yippee! Yeehaw!
Great song Beyoncé  She isn’t a good look a like
God this sounds awful
I don’t even listen to country music but this one has been on my mind❤
😂😂😂Beyonce got these good ol' boys & girls BIG mad!  Don't be a bitch, go take it to the floor now, and pipe tf down. Enjoy the history lesson!💃🏾
“HEYYYY ITS FRANKLINNN”
FANTASTIC. Bey does it again. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm not feeling it. I dig most of her music though. Chick is showing to much in my opinion. I think once you become a mother especially with a teenage daughter; ya gotta tighten up your dress code.
This is terrible 😭😭😭 y'all capping thirsty for Beyonce y'all brain washed thinking this shit sounds good
Love the song she es a queen… just expecting a complete video😊
This sucks so bad. Get help.
This ain’t Texas and that’s not country… but it is boring af. And I don’t even know what that costume is…like alien or sommin.
She needs to dress like a mother not a whore
Why isn't this on my TL every day I literally have to search it. I'm a die hard Bey fan this should automatically pop up
Is sick  this women is Michael Jackson 2 obsesión white white
Bey is from Houston, Texas - this makes sense! Great song! Come on Grammy's, give the girl her props next year!
Pure trash 🤮💯
I think it's more Bluegrass than Country but i really like it.  I'd like to hear her take on opera
Nope …. Not country  bye B
Rep Texas Big B and not the little b
This is not country music.
Dam Jay-Z is winning and has been winning 😂 🏆
Nope take ya ass to country n talk about selling drugs, talk about how irreplaceable your man is , give the country genre the same toxic energy you gave blk music u went country n gave a wholesome song ... Saids alot here think about it
‼️You have proclaimed Your own future with Your own words, witch. Because You have spoken words and evil proclamations against the church of Christ and the children of God, You will reap a double harvest‼️
I like Bey... but this ain't country... and this.. ain't that good..
First country song I’m listening to in how many years now? 15 years 🫠
This is not country music but I can see people liking it because it's Beyonce.
Wtaf is this
Dam she is perfect 👍 wow I love this. I am a country fan for sure ❤
Ho down! Not a fan of B but I love country music and this song. She sounds better singing country music. Glad she finally found her lane!!!!!
So she still has to curse in a song just like her other music i may be called square but no reason to use it in a song
Put some clothes on- Country music isn’t about looking like a whore
This video is awesome , and the song is pretty good too 👍
What country would sound like of black people would have owned white people as slaves
Nope!
This is not country but its different
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
It’s a BIG NO for me!  What a joke!
This will either ruin country, or people will finally push back against this pop country bs and start making real country again.
...that ain't no Hank Williams...lol...a more polished than most of what you find in Country music today...
Time to put on my cowboy boots and dance.  Love it!
How can you be so rich and not put out a good song? Especially when you have multiple writers, and family members who might have told you that this was beyond awful. It was painfully bad.
This is only the second Beyonce song I've ever liked. If this is her new music, I can make room on my playlist for Beyonce.🖤
I don’t think I would call this country music…
I am an old Beyonce fan. After the single ladies album, she fell off for me. Im enjoying actually hearing her sign again. Whether this song is country or not, I do enjoy it. It's catchy, and I love her voice! 🥰
Smh, nah! I'm good. This is not country. Stay in hip hop or pop, please!
🗑️ #fblm 🫵🏻🤧
Is this a joke? Beyoncé from the video to the song you coulda done way better I feel like the video is on repeat of u walking and your finger shooting🤣. I’m sorry but it’s horrible.
It sounds TRACY CHAPMAN.
People are mad, lol. This is a visual for the song, not the actual video. Please educate yourselves.
Hmmmm? They’re predictions that Houston is gonna have a big devastating Tornado some day. And she’s from Houston Texas and singing this song. 😮😮😮
Not trying to be hater. The song is good, but the video suck big time. Whoever wrote it whoever directed it don't do it again. The outfit ain't it either
Beyonce has always had a country singing voice. Nothing new.
pretty goood
This video sucks
this song totally sucks and should be thrown into the sun before more idiots decide to make more music like this and further destroy what country music is. this is the furthest thing from country music and is awful! Beyonce should be ashamed of this! all of humanity is dumber for this song!
The music is country but the vocals not.
She just trashed country music. With the outfit and nasty words. She's disgusting
I think I want to throw up. She's not country just trying to make a point
Please explain how this is country music
Country music has been heading in a different direction for the last few years. I believe Beyonce will take it to the next level with this. The song is good at best. But I believe this will do well . Hate it or love it Beyonce has entered the room.
The video?? Repeated scene? 🤔
wow this is garbage
Nope. Sorry this is just repetitive nonsense. Not your bag
Shout out to the Cowboys and farmers
Where was all the outrage a few weeks ago when Luke Combs hit #1 on the country charts singing a Tracy Chapman song and sounding almost exactly the same as the original.  I don't remember everyone running around saying this isn't country.
It’s pathetic….just using her body to sell the video
Odd… something about this video has made me consider enjoying more country music.  Peculiar…
Naaaa no thank ya haaa geeze
Cringe as fuck
Why not sign county music when the banjo was brought  to America by enslaved Africans. ❤❤❤❤
Sounds like she sampled Gretchen Wilson’s song Redneck Woman. 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄 And that outfit is ridiculous.😂
I have officially seen 3 members of Destiny's Child on the news in the last week. Who's dying? 😮
bluegrass  banjo is about white people  Really?  banjo is mandingo words
Yeah, here's the thing. Not country at all. Love everything Beyoncé does. Like the song. Just definitely missing the country element. Everyone now saying they are now a country fan, we'll, cool, but this ain't it.
This is garbage. Beyoncé worships evil too
I like it. I don't listen to her other stuff. Idk what the drama is. It sounds good to me 🤷‍♀️
This isn't country lol
Growing up in a small town this song slaps hard
She needs a video with a purpose and a few more clothes kids watch this too,
The greatest country music artist of all time 🐝❤️🤠
Boring video..
I respect her, but I’m not the biggest fan. Part of the reason I liked watching her was because her videos were interesting. This is just the same thing over and over. Pretty boring. It’s more interesting to watch the people on TikTok do their version of the song!catchy song super boring video
What a shame
I love country, and I think Beyonce is a phenomenal singer and artist, but this is plain stupid and sad and painful to listen to.
What? This is what Hollywood Eric and I dance to in the Whitehouse when the South succeeds? Get out of my fucking house Carl, now I want to know what normally happens! Pod Dolly
Nice!
What in the fk is this😂
Country is screwed. If country woman start dressing like this.
Beyoncé has an amazing voice, she very talented but I just can’t wrap my head around her trying to sing country. I just don’t think her voice is right for country music it’s fit for her usual genre if that makes sense. And that costume I mean how is that country? I’m probably gonna piss off a lot of people but my comment isn’t meant to be mean or cruel. I just don’t know how else to word it. Y’all keep in mind it’s just my opinion. She’s very talented and I wish her nothing but success.
I don't love the gun reference. Sorry not sorry.
She's half naked and the sing sucks. She ain't no country singer and she ll never be one
Well that dog’s jumped and it’s sure enough been humped… but it wasn’t in the country. I’ve seen this pretense before, comin round here trying to sell you real imitation vanilla bean, as surely as she ain’t the Watkins man, she ain’t down home. Cletus, there’s a hooker Gal out the end of the drive, you wanna git her a coat before she catches cold.
😂😂😂😂😂
Shes trying to counter Taylor Swift by going the other direction musically.
Terrible
now Nelly's country album sounds country. check he's out.
Someone got tired of being second to Taylor Swift every year at award season, so she switched genres!!
Don't know what's dumber this song or the video
She totally forgot she’s a mother what a shame
Love it!  Would be outta this world if she did something with Dolly.  Beyoncé and Miley? YES PLEASE!
Not even remotely country
I" Like The Song.
I grew up singing country and western.
Country is Afro indigenous, we southern girls don't play. Confused about the attire and the eye patches,  its far from country and confusing.
Dafawk is this 😂
Love it sister, from bakersfield ca.
If you think this music video is good you must be on crack. The same 15 second clip played over and over and they make millions off this? 😂 what in the actual fuck?
I dont know why but I still feel like it’s not country… its country pop at the most
People are actually thinking this is country music just cause she threw in the twang of an acoustic guitar and has a southern accent. Wtf...just sad
Everbody just saying this song is good because it's Beyonce.🤦‍♀
I like the song , but the clip sucks
I know she’s talented and gifted when it comes to making music but I just don’t care for this song by her.
Nop she still sucks!
I'm glad the woke police  have not declared cultural appropriation...yet.
So does Beyoncé have Afro hair under those wigs?
This is so shit, if you or I were to sing the exact same song no one would dare, truth hurts
Revolution in music... Beyoncé amazing and artist femine world epic ❤🫶👏👏👏👏
maybe wit a real live band backing her it could of been good. but its just pop.
Well we all know why men come to watch this video, doesn’t matter what comes out of her mouth, the visuals will get all the attention!!  What happened to good old fashioned interesting videos
20K dislikes which one of y'all Racist Ma'Phukkkas disliked this Gem.
Umm... Maybe if I keep listening, it will grow on me.
I guess if you back up any lyrics with a banjo these days it makes it a country song.  Or maybe, just maybe, we can ALL be united because we’re human beings and music helps.
I luv this cuntry beyonce 😍
A semi nude video. Geeze.  So classy. 👎
😂😂
the song sounds like Dolly but the video is stupid
Good tune! Costume and chorography wanting....
she selling her boobs not the song
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL TALENTED AWESOME LADY !!!!
Well I'm not a big country fan for one and I'm not a Beyonce fan for two but I'm all for pushing the envelope. I wish they would stop telling us what we can and what we cannot do.
Keep on theivin!!! It pay right
Sorry,  try again. Chapel Hart got her beat by a mile.
Now your gonna steal county #theifonce #queenbee #beyonce #survingthetruth #tjffanyred
This song makes me change my country station every time it comes on... no wonder most country stations didn't want to play this song! This is TRASH
Doesn't take a lot of talent to pose half naked, walk, and run your pretend gun up your body, over and over and over again. It's a gimmick to take your attention away from her mediocre voice.  What a shame, she doesn't need to go to this extreme to get attention. Though, her lack of clothes will cause this to sell more copies thanmif she had worn something more suitable to the genre and the song.
I can’t wait to see the actual video
Looks like someone stole her clothes..... shame
This is shit 😂😂😂😂
Why. Just why. Just stick to R&B. Sorry B fans. Her voice is just so good in the R&B genre. Not this. I get it she’s diverse but not everything works.
This song is corny and not good
Not a country song
No thank you not country girl
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is stupid a shit stay in your B..
This is trash
I hated Beyonce before, this just makes it worse. She's just ick.
Hell yeah everyone gonna have to be cowboy and cowgirls,  let's ride! Team up with Lainey Wilson
This doesn't sound like country music.  That sounds like a regular Beyonce song. The video was boring  as hell.
Now... country music is bout to be corrupted. Smdh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Sped up it sound like Bluegrass🩵🎻
She needs to put a shirt on but I love this song
This why everybody going crazy she showing breasts
Look up Franklin the turtle theme, thank me later.
Country singers don’t dress this provocative, use the word bitch, or racially profile white people with a Lexus… wow!!!
I never thought I would say I'd actualy love to see Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus singing a country song together
I’m not a fan of this video. 😅
This is not country music.
She ant no Charley Pride
WAP is next country stile
She was throwing a fit no one liked her old music now she’s stealing country.. lame as fuck
Is this really what all the fuss is about, really?
Man she should really just stop. She is trash now. How do you go from being the greatest female artist ever to this.
So this just replays itself? Lame
This ain’t country  And I love bey…..💥💥💥💥 And y’all kno it’s not The beat is country but Her cadence isn’t country  At all
oh god now the white folks say we lost Country now.  Beyonce going to get Country Album of the year. lol
Horrible
What is she wearing? Love the song hate the outfit doesn't quite go with the song?
Ik kan niet geloven dat Zijn stijl zo veranderd is, voor terug achterstevoren
This is not country music. She needs to take her a** back to r&b. Worse song I ever heard
Love the song but not the outfits
Five thumbs DOWN!! I really don't like it.  I think she needs to stick to what she knows.  Now of a sudden, she wants to sing country music because she lost the album of the year awards whatever. Country singers do not come out on stage exposing their bodies. They have a lot more respect for themselves. I think she is disrespectful as well as disrespecting country music.🤮
Oookkk! Beyonce tryna b Kuntry 😅 Her voice ain't Kuntry but she did a good job & she's smok'n as alwayz❤❤❤
Put a shirt on 1:21
The trust she has in that jacket is wild
Uhm what
She forgot to wear a shirt.
Foul lyrics = F  Dumb lyics = F  Nude and skanky visualizer = F  Voice talent = C+ (and a bit lazy/bored in delivery) Instrumentals and Melody = B+
Biiich, yous a mom and a role model! Cover up and enjoy your billions you already made!
I love this song ❤️ something different I like
I guess if you put guitars in your song and say stuff like hoe down,  one step to the right or left she thinks it's country😂😂
Fuck all yall this isn't real country justtrae and upchurch are independent artists that make better music for fucking Beyoncé, she's not even fucking country tho foh fr
Meh.
This video is garbage.
Folks who think this is good are also the idiots who think Eminem is a gangster rapper 🤢🤮
This isn’t country
That was terrible.
This doesn’t sound like country to me.
Song sucks
Song is nice but the outfit not suitable for the song
This is booty bruh
Love the song but this video doesn't do it justice
It’s not that good 👍
Hi.  My friend is a big fan.  Thought this was amazing.  Inspired him to write down some poetry to and began practice blending alternate duet combo.  He still needs a little work but the inspiration you have done here has made a very good impression.   Thank you.
Love it❤Queen Bey 🔥🔥
Pass
Pretty lame.
How do we get this to go number one on billboard
But it's not that good of a song. It's ok  But it's not worthy of #1. Maybe low top 20s It's ok. It's not a hit.
I like your song, but did you have to expose that amount of your breast to make it a hit????  It's way too much.
I prefer the lyric video...🫣
Love it! 💜
Um no just no never ever
This video is a joke.
This is a whole vibe
This ain’t country btw
Come on Beyoncé I can’t wait to see the video that goes with this song
Why does America or wherever call biracial people black ?if they have white blood also in their veins , its so rediculous , rather not say anything, if you so concerned about racial matters ,z why uplift one part and not the other part? all people by now come from mixed races,  my son has a lovely woman she is   a dark lady a beautiful person and if she has a child , i would want the child to he proud of  my side as well
This is not country music😂😂😂
Country obviously isn't country anymore since anybody thinks they can do it.
🗑️
Even her boobs can't make her sing good .  People stop lying to her that she has a singing voice .
How can you guys not admit that this song is atrociously bad? It's okay if you like beyonce, but this is not a good song LOL
Song is good. I just having hard time to hear any country rythm
❤❤
Put some clothes on girl
Oh boy this is about to be politicized for sure. Conservatives are about to lose their $#!t
This is the worst non country song I've ever heard. Dear God who even listens to Beyonce? I've never heard anyone bump a Beyonce song in the wild. Same with Jayz Trash music duo perfect for each other
Not country.  Kanye Z will politic the Grammys to make sure she gets album of the year.  She does not write any of her songs and plays no instrument.  Quite a few of her Grammys came from the ensemble groups she belonged to.  Just a singer and no more.
no class............why? why be slutty, why cuss to make music. Ridiculous. Great song.....but
Nothing country abt a half naked woman. Now I can see why a country station  refused to play it! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Ghetto asf
Wow any woman or man can go country song 🎵 I believe it goes like that !
I love Queen B butttt I'm a little disappointed because this song doesn't sound better than New Artist Reyna Reynolds or K Michelle country introduction. What's happening here. Boy oh Boy  Money can make you tone deaf to other artists
Well, this is interesting 🤨 to say the least... Is this what country is coming to 🤔🙄
Song and video are both horrible! How can anyone actually like this!? Embarrassing.
🗑️
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love real country. This ain’t country. Unless you like mainstream turd country. This isn’t her wheel house. She’s hot. That’s it.
Franklin is owed royalties. The only thing black about C&W is blacks calling it honkey tonic
This is not country music probably the worst song Beyoncé has ever made
It’s not country music it’s pop music identifying as country music ,,go back to your world
This is terrible she sounds like a rat.
This is sick I can't even let my children watch this nor hear this since when did country music start getting cuss words so bad in them and country music is not her roots
That is NOT country music!!😂😂😂
Sick of her
Catchy! 😊🤩🇺🇲 I think its really good! Think country music has made it into the main stream for yeeeeeeaars! Lady A, Shania Twain, Tim Mcgraw, Dolly Parton. Go on yonce. Dip yo toe in that country pie! 😅😂
I like it. She kills it with her country debut. Very clever to show the same action as this keeps the viewer focused on the song.
Dumb song are yall foreal... Really listen to counry music .. yall need hearing aid foreal . Even my boyfriend said wtf is that , thats not counrty music . They just giving her hype because of her name . Yall dont know music at all
I’m surprise she ain’t twerking and her skin look white. These celebrities change ethnicity every year. 😂😂
Lol , that's not country  !! If you all want to like on this because it's Beyonce, that's fine, but at least be honest and call it what it is, THAT'S NOT COUNTRY  !
Is this a joke? 😂😂😂😂 what is this video?😂😂😂😂 Queen B. Thank you for this laugh.  The tune is catchy.
I bet that she has never had mud on her boots. Just sayin.
Now this is nice
not my kind of country😳too fake. too provocative. lacks morality.
Shhhhhh, she normally sings this in the Whitehouse for Hollywood Eric and Dolia to dance to because all we knew about was the succession! EJB The reg me
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
This vid should be published only on Onlyfriends. When did it become normal to be 1 inch from being topless for 4 minutes?
She should be ashamed of herself pathetic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑👑
Pssst in real life I had everyone sign equal rights because Hollywood Eric said Beyonce’ dressers like the Queen and they both sing in Texas knowing that the nation divides…. this other stuff in real life is out of control! Hollywood part
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot  100 after only 4 days on the charting week. The song is projected to go #1 next week! 👑🐝
Not a good country song . I heard better county music 😊then this . Just because she's Beyonce . Sorry it's a no for me
Not country … pop maybe
This isn’t country this is laughable
Beyonce bringing her filth to the country scene now. If she fell to the floor that would be a true hoe down and by the way thats not a number one song.
I like Boobs😂 thats why im here. Now i also like Country Songs😂 yipppi yaaaa yeeeeeee
Coulda had a great video- this is awful
That's not country music, not good at all 👎👎👎
Of course she's not capable of bringing anything to the table without being barely dressed. Doesn't matter if it's a good song if she is just going to bring the same smutty, sexualization visuals with it. Desperate for that album of the year Bee?
I bet some country artists are not happy....
This is the most boring music video and song ever.  😂
Love the song.
No!!!! yuck  this is not country.. this totally violates country music  yuck...Stay in your lane Beyonce
This isnt even country... Have tou guys even listened to shania twain, kenny chesney or jason aldean.
2 on the top 100 and hasn’t even been out a month! YOU GO BEY!❤
Song sucks video trash stay to what you know please 🙏
Pew Pew 🤠
I was expecting a very nice choreograph dance epic. So, what's up with this costume,I know damn sure they didn't dress like that when dancing country.😮
If this video was any worse. I might have actually listened to the song. Pure nonsense.  So Sad 😞 pathetic
Oh she trolling now cause WTH is this 💀😂.
Soooo, she has to be half nekkid to get likes? Nah, no like from me.
This song is pure classless garbage.
If she didn't have big knockers this video and song would be for naught.
Yea I disliked it.   It’s not that good aye.
Trash
Not impressed
Beyonce needs to stay out of Country Music. She is mocking country! And the outfit is pure smut. Go back to your pole Beyonce. Stop insulting true Country artists.
She ruined a cute song with the monotonous video!! Could have really gone to town with that.
This is not a country song at all,try again Bey😂😂😂😂
Fyi Black people created county music
A lot of angry white dudes!
this is really considered a  country song??🤨🤷🏽‍♀️
You are so wrong. I am  a Black Queen who love country music. Just wrong 😕
This ain’t country
I can’t lie this song is catchy as hell. Been in my head for days. I really like it. My only thing is Bey should’ve dropped a dance with it and it would’ve really took off. Tik tok would’ve done its thing. Not a fan of the 16 carriages but this one hits different. Makes you want to get up and dance 🕺🏼
there are some cute country type shirts that would've went well with that outfit...
That's not country 😕  that's a stripper at a booby bar trying to sing pop and soul
Don’t like the video and don’t care for the song. Don’t care for the cussing either🤷‍♀️
Queen Bee never disappoints
Not bad! Just wish she had a country twang/accent and it’d really be full country for me, but it has a nice country song vibe and is a good song all together. It does remind me of the Franklin tv show theme song though 😅
If that is country I'll kiss your ass
She thought she did that? I don’t even like country music and I can say, honey, sit your ass down. I can’t even get past “This ain’t Texas”. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Nothing wrong with the song although she could have covered up somewhat.
What a shit show
hmm
I think she’s trying hard to get the album of the year award it’s all she ever wanted
We can't have nothing
Well, here goes country music turning into a bunch of sex and twerking..
Gross.
Am I the only one hoping to see some nipple action?
Absolutely disgusting
I dont believe the black community would entertain it at ALL if the same lyrics & voice was done by a Caucasian country music singer..Idk,? How hard was Vanilla ice or Eminem laughed at by the black community when their 1st song hit the air waves??? So what are we really selling here? Shes half naked & very pale? Music? Nudity Or an idea?? #facts
Fucking terrible. <period
Not a fan of country music and this doesn’t make me one.
This is fucking terrible lmao music is FUCKED
this is not country, hate to tell yall
😳
Song stinks
❤
Can you become North’s teacher? I don’t want North to become like Cardi B
Nothing country about this trash. Just because they say it is don’t mean it is. Let the brainwashing continue.
Dumbest song, dumbest video. Stay in your lane Beyoncé
Holy cows county music just got a new hot COUNTRY GAL! ❤ YOU BEYONCE
Disgrace to real country
Y’all shocked country was started by black folks wad stolen like every thing els we just pushing forward
Yall who are saying you are now country fans , uhhhh no your not, your a Beyonce fan and you like this song and this song is no where near close to country music.  Juuuust keeping it uhhh 🤔 ohhhh 💯,  ðid I do that right?
Wow  this isn't country at all! Hmm! Smh
I don't show my boobs. I
This song not it
Great interpretation but I hated the video
Love this 🙌🏾
Why does she have to be half naked just to sing.  Then Taylor Swift just has too shakes it
Whole lot of microaggressions up in this damaged comment section. Y'all ok? It's gonna be ok, babies.
🗑️🗑️
😶
I can see Beyonce singing and she got talent.,🎙️🎙️🎙️
🖤👑🇧🇷
booba
Beyonce is NOT the first Black Country Music singer. The Original is Linda Martell https://youtu.be/O1uf578zZB4?si=ECdORHbima-M9rz3
Nice titties but not country
Um nooooooooooo! She needs to stick to her rapping pop crap. Not a fan. You know what I find amazing the Kardashians wore corn rows and they got beat up left and right for culture appropriation but this chic can slap on a blonde white people hair and be half naked in fishnets and call this country music crossover. Again ummmmmm noooooooo!
This was wack 😂 she can't make no more hits with pop so she decided to try this now ouch
Probably the most condescending piece of trash to ever be called country. Missed the mark by a country mile.
Omg seriously? She needs to leave country music to the true country artists and stay in her lane. Jealousy doesn't look good on her at all.
No way!!
The song is very catchy, Could have been a winner. Not a fan of her outfit at all. Not a fan of her using the B & S word at all. Will never see country fans going for this type of clothing and lyrics at all.
I kinda like it but its not country 🤣🤣
Sorry Beyonce..put the girls away...country isn't that
A real hoe down. Nothing like true gaslighting. Stay in your lane
God save her soul. All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. Proverbs 7:22,23 Rejecting God/Jesus as savior will cost you your life and eternal place in heaven. Jesus died 4 you believe & repent.
I ❤🎉 love this 😢❤ I’m criying watching with joy
NOPE
No Ma’am.
🤮
No thanks.👎🏻
I love the country! So good QueenB!
I'm reading the comments and people keep saying there was a song.....I didn't notice.
Soft porn and not country music!
Shine more light on the COWBOYS OF COLOR beyomce.. were waiting ⏰⏰
Girl needs some real boots & a Texas hat!!  she is so bad ass. She look good in anything, but all the nakedness isn’t required.
Well she definitely kept her trashy look. She'll never be competition for Taylor Swift.😅😅😂
🤦‍♀️ “don’t be a bitch come take it to floor”… trash standing there… put some clothes on. This not country.
Someone should’ve told Beyoncé in country music we don’t let our “bits” just hang out. We dress appropriately and push the girls up, not just leave them hanging like that. Also, your gun pointing fingers is not very country anymore. I’m just saying.
Not for me! God Bless You Child!
Here for all the racist😂😂😂
What a joke this song is awful.  Her worst song
And what exactly is this called? And what the hell is she singing about?
This is getting hype cuse her name and die hard fans. Taylor swift could put out a "hip hop" song and her crazy fans will make it 1#
🤮
O yes I couldn't wait hopefully jayz will sing back up and snoop dog play the fiddle!!!!
lol
Just 'cause it twangs don't make it country.
🙏🏼🌸❤️🌹🌼🌻🇨🇦🌺🇨🇦♥️🌹❤️🙏🏼🌸
Not a fan of this by Bouncy
Houston resident here wondering what took her so long...
She is killing country music. Pathetic
If shit could make music, it would sound like this.
I freaking love it and I always loved a few country songs… especially Sweet Home Alabama ❤😂
It’s not country. So racist to not play it on a country station.😂😂😂😂
No.
Sexy
How is this song good? Yall tripping this song sucks.
Black Americans created country music too. Cry me a river.
Not really
YeeHaw
This is.....terrible
You go girl, this is awesome
Tits on a robot

This sucks 😂😂😂
This is country https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqBgmGk_ZNM
I’ve been a fan of country music for awhile. I started listening to K Michelle awhile ago and she has that country soulful twang and roots; love the song Country Love Song featuring Justin champagne. There’s room for everyone. Texas Holden by is Beyoncé is ok, but I really like K Michelle in the country lane. She is a natural.
What's the point of the video?
Where's her band? It don't exist. Country music is about playing with your band like family. The Banjo and guitar you hear are hired guns (hired guitar players. They play what you want, get the money and leave) You can hear that in the music. No soul or connection. And it's heavily processed with computers. drums ain't real. Sorry, this ain't country.
This is not Country. Toooooooooo, I was getting a headache each time she would hoot at the end of a course .
It does sound like the Franklin the Turtle theme song lol
I will be using this video with a lot of hand lotion!!!
This is country?! 😂 Yeah, I dont think so.  Not even on a bad day.
Not country. This sucks.
I'm getting ready to learn how to do the Country Electric Slide ~🤗
YeeeeeeeNaaaaw!!! 🤠 Nah bruh! Hold deez!!!! 🥜🐿️🌰
Wow it’s as horrible as her non country music!  I guess it’s not just her regular music I hate, but also her voice as well!  Thanks, Beyoncé, for clearing that up for me 😂🤮
Sorry but she needs to stay in the pop music , her 2 country songs SUCK
That Vortex is the Prettiest You know why?  Mirror mirror  on the wall told Me ❤😌
Didn’t know about this until I saw some s$&* badmouthing it on the internet.  I love it.  Beyoncé is a treasure!
All Lives Make Country Music. This is the best Country song ever.
Beyonce really hates her culture and loves White culture
This isn’t country- just because u say Texas 🙄 stay in your lane B
Beyonce the first black woman to do it yessssss ❤❤❤❤❤love it
That thing on her eye is ridiculous
This is an insult to country music.
Cowboy culture is Mexican culture with roots from Spain not something from the U.S nor Texas, and black cowboys exist because Mexicans show them how to be cowboys because they fleed from slavery
This is not country what a joke
In country they wear clothes
it’s so bad haha worst song of the year
I'll pass
Very strange to be No.1 country song when it's NOT about Texas or country.
This is t country
👎 horrible!!!
😂😂😂😂😂
Trash
I'm not saying people shouldn't explore different genres, but I find it funny when people who vehemently disagree with country folk values are suddenly into country music and aesthetic just to hop on trend. Meanwhile, really down to earth, soulful country music is getting noses turned up at it. No hate, just a strange contradiction.
Why she dressed like a space hooker?? I'm a musician. THIS AIN'T COUNTRY. It's missing authentic country soul. Sounds like it was produced with computers. NOPE, sorry, it's missing that country heart and soul. Like I said. You can hear it's made with computers
Who's listening to this in 2024!?!   No seriously. Who the fuck is listening to this trash?
This is horrible
This ain't even country music.... y'all support anything and everything
If I offend too BAD
Trans
Really
With so much money in the bank and a roll model to two daughters, she deems it necessary to almos show it all just to make a bit more money.  She is a wonderful singer, she’s loved and admire by the masses, there was no need for her to have to stooped down this low. SMH
The sound is cool, I'm happy to see someone big just suddenly shift genres for a bit, but my god, these lyrics suck.  It tries to mix with her older stuff and it just leaves this song in an awkward spot.
This is an absolute Joke and a disgrace to country music! Mainstream you're a Joke!! This is mainstreams way of trying to stay relevant during a time when independent artists are taking over and this is an absolute FAIL!! Stay in your lane Beyonce' lol You Ain't Country!
🙄 why the nudity?? let the music stand for itself, intead of click baiting so people can get a glance. I'm over it.
Haters need to find themselves.
No no no no no no no no no no no, stay in your own lane Beyonce you are not country and you never will be !!  Just like those new to so-called country music wanta be,  many of us old timers will never accept these newer artists and it at least started from Taylor Swift to present day . Sorry actually since 2000 country music has went downhill and dang near every artist that's coming to country music since 2000 have no clue to what country music is all about you may look country you may sound country but you are not country no matter how hard you try !!!!!!
it ain't Texas.....and this ain't country either
Now I see why this is so popular.
It's time somebody makes country sexy
Sure.. expose yourself.. great role model
If people call this country music then lady Gaga poker face is a country a song.
This is not country. This is a parody song. Sorry‼️😬🤯🥴👀
Not impressed! It's country your trying to sing not a Playboy show.
It sucks and it's not real country
That has got to be the dumbest video I have ever seen. Beyonce and country music don't go together at all .. like wtf was that
Such a great song, not a huge fan of the visualizer, though!
Beyonce "is a guest in this house..." or insert every other generic comment made against when Caucasians dabble in genre of predominantly other races.   That being said...Beyonce is an unbelievable talent and flat out beautiful as always.
This isn’t country
This isn’t country!!
Toby Keith turning in his grave right now. 😂😂😂
She forgot her clothes. Sorry not my fav.
It Sucks
Yeah terrible
Notice the one eye 👁 covered up.👹
Wtf is this GARBAGE?
Now I’d like to see Beyoncé collaborate with Gary Clark Jr.  Two amazing Texas artists
This ain't texas, but you can hold em?
This is NOT country....
#TexasHoldEm
Sorry not country music. Just because the lyrics are country, doesn't make it country.
Dont like it.!
How does this trash make it to #1? Fuckin hick-hop, tractor rap bullshit.
This isn't country and she usually does good but she really messed up with this one.  This is just garbage
Beast
Why can’t she come up with a good dance song?
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮g gross!  Country music is classic even in their clothes.   Nope, voice is a noooo.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is this what we call a music video in 2024?! I miss MTV and VH1. Take me back….
Absolutely garbage
Everyone just mad abt her making bomb ass songs, they def have no taste in music. They should not be here.
Shes hot but the song is awful.
I'm all for a risk and changing things up, but don't understand why she felt to dress like a stripper. This is country girl.
Sounds like gospel to me not country
Well,look at that
Lady gaga joanne era impact
This song wack
She can sing country but this song definitely doesn’t have hit all over it
This song is garbage!
TRASH
Great Song and much needed today in Country Music to bring a jump to your day. Reminds me a of a song by Imani Coppola called " Legend of the Cowgirl " So please dance like nobody is watching you.
You ROCK
AWESOME
Great first entry into the country music genre and better than anything that racist asshole John Schneider has ever done with his life.
oh i love it , Beyonce just Rocks the song
❌️❌️❌️
This is actually really good. Unique and clean.
Hey it’s franklin
😂😂😂😂😂🤮🤮
Ummmmmm - she looks hot for sure! But I’m bored after 13 seconds.  And the song is actually not good. Just because it’s her doesn’t mean it’s good.   I was expecting more.
They mad at her😂 they won't play her song on their country station. I heard. Heck naw to the naw naw naw😂 she taking our Texas history back. But they think she being racist. Lol against who? Lol
trash
It's not country music and a real cowgirl won't dress in a costume with a half mask. There is nothing country about any of this.
So who paid paid Billboard or the CMA for this to be #1? The tune is catchy but not number 1. It's #1 because of the Name Beyonce..not the song
It’s not country
J’aime plus la voix de Beyoncé maintenant qu’avant.
Girl, you're a cornballll and so is both your wanna be country video and record😂😂😂
If she's country she would have already been. It's obvious she's just trying to save her career. Country fans are most accepting..Darius Rucker and many others did the same thing
Do women always have to be half naked?
Lol it's a real Hoe down
Hard pass. 👎🏼
Nope
Hell nah not this half black powder singing our songs
Selena Gomez I s from Texas too, so lets see how she sounds...bey can sing obviously but her fans are not country music fans .. leave that to the real country singers
Awful song 😂😂 what's with the background singers?
That is the Worst song I’ve heard in years
Culture appropriation
This is not country this woman has no class at all.
Yummy 😋🤤
It wasn't very good. I'm disappointed, she took the trash of hip hop and contaminated country music.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL  this isn't country, not even country pop.  pop with a gospel-ish rhythm.

I love the song.  The video sucked.
😂
Unauthentic, lets just get beyonce songwriters from all genres so she can make money
Stay outta Texas. Stay outta country
Naa ......next
I like the song but the video really sucks. So boring!!!!
Trash
Boo Boring
AI  in the middle😂
Not sure about this one don't like it
Suck
No, it needs more country 🤷‍♀️ doesn't sound like Hill Billy or Honk Tonk it still sounds R&B sorry!
It reminds me of The Git Up. Saying similar words the hoedown and the shouting but hers louder..
STUPID!!!
Love it...
Poor outfit🙄
Don't understand what all the hype is. This isn't Country just because it's got Texas and Whiskey in it.
💕🙏😇💕
This is pure child neglect. I want to cry watching this. I could never put my children in these circumstances no matter what I was going through. Those poor babies!!! 😔 I hope they get cleaned up or adopted by grandparents. I noticed old cigarette butts on the floor which adds to them breathing in second hand smoke. I cannot believe what I’m seeing.
Like it, but did the writers get their fair share this time
Music and words are good.  Outfit and video suck big time.
I dont like it 😕
They know we know who they truly are. This is why she changed tunes. God is here and rocking world
WTF just weird!!
Wow...from full satanic at times, many times. This is shocking..i love the song. Don't trust her though. I think they know we on to them..how can ya not be? This is insane different..question everything
I’m not sure how I feel about this. But she definitely got the Texas part down.
She can sing for sure
Respect
Love the song! The video is just stupid!
Is this white cultural appropriation ?????? Jk lol good song
This is very calm.
Ah, this not for me. Some of the language.
This is terrible
Wow! Who doesn't like to look at Beautiful! I may have to trade in my Beemer for a Lexus. Lol! Oh! And the song is nice too!
LOL, this is crap.
My first thought: Oh! Beyonce figured out she can sing without being gross! Watching the video: Nope, she's stuck in nasty mode.  Fun song but forever stuck relying on nudity. Sad.
this song sucks! sorry not sorry
This song is about the civil war in Texas
This ain't country
This complete shite! It's even bad for a country song! 🤮🤮🤮
I had to look it up and I regret my decision. I wish I could forget this experience. Country is already bad but this is horrid.
Meh.... And that outfit is terrible.
It's definitely a real live hoe down 😂
Trashy and boring.
Franklin the Turtle is mad AF. This is his song!! She did it again! 😡
Now picture miley Cyrus singing this. Would sound so much better with her vocals. Beyoncé is just singing to the beat of a country style song
Lol this is not country music😂
Smh, no just noooo. Ya swerved in the wrong lane with this travesty
Diva ❤😮
Why's it kinda eat though
This is the dumbest song. She has an amazing voice. But this isnt it. 😬
This isnt country music 😂😂
No.
I like this song but, this outfit really Beyonce  grow the hell up, show some self respect
Country music has been terrible for a while. I'm glad to see this song is true to form.
If I had a fast car I'd drive away from this song as fast as I could
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Wtf????  This NOT  country at all. This is a big joke and a insult to real country music
Its cute.
This aint country and true country fans/artists are ashamed. Put some dam* clothes on and respect the genre your attempting to be a part of.
Freemason CIA sex kitten programming. The way they use people. Jackie O Marilyn and many many other victims. Its really overly sexualized. Like vegas shows. Showgirls.
🤢🤮
I just don’t recall seeing this outfit on the cowboys and cowgirls when I lived in AZ.
Never listen to any of her songs till now!!!!!!!!!  LOVE IT
Wtf is that outfit… don’t make country whoreish like everything else plzzzzz. So sick of it. 💀 As far as sticking to the genre sound-wise, I was ready to be mad, but it is fairly country except the outro.
What a damn joke....😂😂😂😂
This made it to #1? Lol it's so cringy
I hate country
This is the dumbest video ever. Almost as bad as the song
This ain't Texas but them are boobies
This is definitely not country
Really?  This is a horrible song.
If this is country... yall must be watching too much Brittney spears still.. lord help us
She doesn’t like edm anymore 😆
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, ok. Yes.
Cute song but not much effort put into the video
That's a 'No' from me...
here comes the line dance
Yahsss I'm a proud Texas girl let me put on my cowboy hat now ayeeee
I mean I like the ring but not a country song actually most of new country is pop
This is horrible
A woman calling a man "bitch" is NOT country.
REYNA ROBERTS
This sucks
I am not a big fan of country but this hits different I hear it all over tiktok and YouTube make more please hug fan
This is pop
Doesn’t sound like country lol
Not a country fan, had to look it up after a article said it's number one on the hot 100 for country..... Noticed a comment that said This song  was made by someone using a AI to write a country song with her voice...... After listening to the song.  This person is indeed correct.   Couldn't pass one min mark.
This is my favorite song no buts or what's
Poor girl with jay z STI z
This is not country!!! But a very catchy song!!!
Stereotype much. There's whiskey, a dive bar and a tornado. Must be a country song. Stick to pop music.
Pathetic.  What a sick joke
Umm.....
This is far from country this is ridiculous
This is fucking trash
We are evolving and understand music transcends genre, sex, race we identify with we are human. We are not just the animals/mammals we think we are  and we are not from this place or that place we are from earth.
I’m from Texas I don’t like it . I Bet it’s gone be some kinda of dance to this song.
I actually like it. Go Beyonce go
This is absolutely horrible.
Pourquoi j'aime la contry maintenant 🤔
I'm so confused
I like the song
Sns, that's God awful and the outfit is ridiculous!
Rvshvd 👈 MUST lookup now
Pitticca sa cagara!!
Love it!
ABSOLUTE 🗑...TRASH , stay in your lane!
I don't know what's more impressive: the song or the guts it took to cut it. There are a lot of Honky Tonks outside of Texas and if I heard a piece like this emanating out of one on a Friday night, I would definitely go check it out. And no doubt, the place would be hopping.
Kanye created the rivalry no one asked for 😂
I must admit. Listening to this had me tapping my foot to the rhythm before I was even aware of it. Hmm, She can do Country too, huh?!
this woman cant make a bad song !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FIRE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh old barn it, you made me a country fan 🐴🤠
I liked the song, but the video? They saved 😅😅
Musics giving old Texas brothel energy
Really like the song, but a bit disappointed in the video clip (just my opinion)
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!!!!
I like it. It makes me want to line dance. I’ve alway listened to a lot of different music genres from classical to jazz to Blues to country. I have two black parents and growing up they played Kenny Rogers, Dolly Pardon, Garth Brooks, Billy Ray, Faith Hill, Loretta Lynn, Crystal Gail, and Reba McIntyre. Even my grandma loved that Here’s Your One Chance, Fancy song. 😂 Charlie Pride is a famous black country singer who has been around a long time but I also like Darius Rucker, Chapel Hart, and some I know personally like Luke West. I was invited to a show at the Grand Ole Opry. It was amazing.
Not country, especially here clothes steam punk but not country, too bad no longer country music anymore.
Trash this isn’t country
I’m a country fan just not of this shit. Guess you gotta get your t!ts out to sell it
WTF is this?
She missed her chance not only to make this a country song but a spiritual. Let's see what Hannah Barr can do with this.
Put some damn clothes on
🗑 😂
What the heck is this? 🙅‍♀️
The urinating dog.This girl know s nothing of country.Why is she naked, terrible song😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤢😳
Looking like a washed up PROSIT#TE..ITS A NO!!!
Is this a joke? Made number 1 on Top 20??? It sucks!!!
She’s going to win a lot of country music awards
What a absolute crock of turds 😂😂😂
Hot garbage. Not country at all.
Talk about super low budget video.   Lets make a music video of you where you're half naked, and what material is there is just sloppily out together. And the whole video will be a short sequance on repeat for the entire song.
She is so fabulous
Not country, not good.
Always hated country music til now 😮
This isn't country music. This is straight-up trash.
I'm a country music fan and this is pretty good. It's as much - or more - "country" sounding than many of the current country songs out today. I like it.
This song is everything!!!
Trash!!
Ok let’s all agree why everyone is watching to this song and it’s not because the lyrics are the greatest.
She says I'm going nowhere.. 😭😭😭😭💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love ut❤
This isnt the actual music video.
Yawn 😴
The brainwashing worked. Not a good song, not country, and not a very good singer. Oh and the outfit?? Like someone else said who ever styled her should be fired.
I thought Texas was on shhhh list of The Opps.
Well, the song sounds ok, but the video shows nothing she's doing. She's half dressed and only shooting from her fingers. I want to see her sing the song. Not happy with this.
she better put some clothes on cover up her clevage😮 "I have never seen a country video with that much skin showing ,please don't crossover to country, and if you do "PUT CLOTHES ON , COVER UP" OR BETTER YET TRY RIDE A HORSE WITH THAT OUTFIT😂😮
🔥
She cannot copy Taylor swift styles... she's original....
love it
Caricature of country. Being almost naked gives it away. Thumbs down.
You go Miss B🤣👌👍✋️💙
Stop drinking the flavor aid. This is garbage. Lame attemp at country. Garth brooks might as well start rapping about Hard nights in the inner city as a baller whos trying to escape the violence his own people cause him and his family
What piss.
Bro this lady just took the beat from the theme song Franklin lol.
Horrible no country just trash
Bleh nope.
Could of done so much more with this music video. Like anything. The first few were cool but made you want more then when you didn’t get more they got tiring and not cool no more.
How embarrassing  to even think this is country music...have some self respect to use profanity in country music ...not a fan
Love this
Definitely a Ho down
For some reason I do not care for the video. I like Bey when she is fully dressed and has her pantyhose on right, the seam goes to the back, center of the legs. Bey you do not have to perform half dressed, you are a beautiful lady with a beautiful body. Your talent sells your music. When I play your music I am usually driving or doing housework, what you wear or do not wear is not what makes me like your music. 🥰🥰😍Feb. 21, 2024.
I LOVE THE SONG & THE VIBE OF IT BUT THIS VIDEO GASTA  GO🙀🤨 WHO WAS DRUNK ENOUGH TO APROVE THIS VIDEO CONCEPT WHEN THEY KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A CONTROVERSIAL SONG FOR HER & THE CROSSOVER 🤔😾  I WAIT FOR THE NEW VIDEO WITH A HOT OFFICIAL LINE DANCE FOR THE SONG🤪😹 THE SONG IS HOT THOUGH I MUST SAY❣️😻 REMIX❣️💯😻💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾 BEYONCÉ CALL ME & MY DAUGHTERS TO BE IN THE HOT VIDEO FOR THIS SONG, SIS😸😻
That is disgusting and sad.
I’m laughing 😂 Gettiup ❤  Gettem B🔥
Lmao this song has to be one of the saddest attempts at a country song
This is an odd video, but I’m looking to see what else she does.
She's not the best singer, I like her up tempo dance hits
I'm hearing some gospel in there, too.
Yikes……had to turn this song off, just no.
Why do you liberals feel the need to ruin everything. You tanked hip hop and RnB with your nonsense already, let country be. I doubt miss billionaire has any similarities to the common folk.
this song fucking sucks BIG BALLLLLSSSSSSSS
This shit here is not Country I don’t know what the fuck it is but it’s for sure not Country this shit literally made me throw up in my mouth the most unreal, shitty sounding song I’ve ever heard in my entire life that’s coming from somebody who had to listen to you think you the shit you’re not even a fartand that shit is still better than this dumbass shit
Im not even a fan and im here for this song....the more they hate...the more them why folks hate the more it gon drive this up da chart❤❤❤
She can sing way better than Taylor S .
Never a fan of beyoncé 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾,devils bride.YH
I like it.  This song is a mixture of Beyonce and country twang. The vocals are Beyonce with a lil’ bit of country. She should’ve turned up that country guitar in the back. Switching genres and blending genres? That’s so…me! :-)
I love country music it tells  a story and I appreciate  this, and of I love me some queen b
We're is her clothes 😢
This is country?….
Not even country music straight garbage😂
Trash
Beyoncé used to be the shit what the hell happened.
Only talent she has is showing off her body and writing about her husband cheating on her to make money
What's a half naked women have to do with country music?
This is crap of a video 😂😢
sounds like shit
I Love it!!
Sorry not country to me.
umm what is this.....
I love country music this is amazing ❤😍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Wtf is this shit?!?! 🤦‍♀️🤣
It looks terrible! 😅 Why this if "Renaissance" was released one year ago!
Song and video is stupid as hell. Just because you buy produce your own music doesnt mean you should Harrific
Proof that platinum hair and a cowboy hat don't make you country.
The video and I am a Beyonce fan and a country fan .... this is a trash song and video. Whoever she hired to produce this music and video should be fired. You won't reinvent the genre this way.
This is the video?
She has a beautiful voice but this is not even close to country. It sounds as if shes doing karaoke.
Uh that's a no. From a TEXAN 😅😅😅😅😅
Absolute garbage
This is an insult to country music! There’s nothing country about this crap. BTW get some clothes on.
Now just waiting for K’Michelle.
Beyoncé hitando no house/Eletronic e agora no country
TRASH! A desperate attempt to stay relevant....it's embarrassing!
I love this. I need more of Beyoncé singing country music. I love Daddy Lessons too
Did they just film one scene and then put it on repeat?
Aweful video.  Like really bad
TRASH Just plain TRASH.
Videos dumb song even worse.
Stupid!
The whole video is her walking and shooting her imaginary gun ya are something else this lady can fart and ya swear is rainbow fluff lol like the best tho lol
Hogshite
Bland and unoriginal…🤷🏾‍♂️
I think it sounds pretty. I don't know why people are buggin about her doing country. Her voice fits the genre well.
Trash
She is just doing the same exact thing over and over I. The music video…. BUT I do love the song
Trying to compete with Taylor swift I don't think so
This sucks
Song is OK but why that outfit? 😮
Does she know what country is? Her outfit would say... no. Her song sounds like everything else she does with a twangy background.
Brasil te ama ❤️❤️❤️😍🥰
Country ❤❤❤❤
😮❤
What possessed Beyonce to sing country. Not winning enough awards being herself or what? SMH. It is decent tho.
Sucks😢
Oh god no stay tf away from country music
Kinda basic
Why she have to use sexual ho strut & vulgar language to make a country song?
It is not like country music 😂, Beyoncé rise and fall moments
This isn’t country
Guess is this supposed to be serious? 😂
This is sad. I've been a fan of country music for 20+ years and got laughed at but "Bey" adds some twangy guitars to a song, calls it country and y'all are all of a sudden "country music" fans. #disgusting
Half naked demon singing country.  How sad
Great Bey😂 that video is the bomb 👌🏾💣. You're  just walking and walked into  #1 on Billboard's Hot COUNTRY Chart🎉🎉 The first Black woman to top the Country Chart.  Do it Beyonce, teach those people the history of country music.  It's not a new thing for  people.
horrible lol. nowhere near country LOL
The new country is kinda like FOX News now.  Disgusting
Pop-country…catchy tune…but just like most everything else on country stations…it’s pop music
Beyoncé is Queen, don’t fucking forget it. This song slaps idc who you are…. ❤
I suddenly miss Achey Breaky Heart. This is not country
How many takes did she do??? Nip slip country 😅
This is a hot mess, fake half dressed people. Video is wicked to me.
Trash
No.
I don’t know what people are listening to but this song is trash I fucking hate country music
😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry it’s trash
Sux ass
This is horrible.
crazy how bey can make me like any genre of music!!
A great Line Dance Number of the R&B Queen. Sexy Video❤
I really like the song but now i regret seeing the video.. Sex sells, but the song was good enough that it didn't need this level of crass.
Uhhhhhh okay..I guess
she done already done had herses
Put some clothes on.
Like the song, but the video is weird af…. 🤣
Not a fan of country Beyonce to be honest good try tho
Y'all kids hear the comments saying they know all about country but Y'all don't and that's fine. It's the music Y'all grew up with.
Soft core porn
I like this a lot more than most of what's been called Country since the beginning of the Keith Urban era.  Some Bluegrass flair topping the charts in 2024???  I'm all for it!
Horrible just straight up horrible. Seriously NOT and I mean NOT country.
She's a clown.......she has never won album of the year, now she want to sing Country.......I say boycott her and her clown husband.....
this is not country lmao, this shit is ass
Dude this is something else
beyonce say she gonna get the album of the yr grammy!!! Watch out Taylor!!! She doing the damn thang!
I love this.  Has she done an entire album in this genre?  I have got to get this.
I wish she could stop with the sleezy outfits it’s just immoral  You ought to do better  Texas will do what is right for their state and all your singing will not stop it  NCSWIC
If folks want a Grammy they need to explore new genres because Taylor takin em all. Pretty soon we gonna see Billie singing gospel and Lana doing r&b
No way this is country music she needs to stop
How ghetto
This is absolutely horrible! The music the video all of it!!
What's up with the boobs? 😂
people forget that the black community created country, and the first cowboys were Hispanic.
Good song; stupid video. Don't come @ me for speaking the truth.
Good song, horrible video
Not country and why half naked?  Not a fan
Well this definitely isnt topping the charts cause it's any good.
Well, I'm surprised with how good she is. Every bit as good as some of the "country" singers around now
Very bad in my opinion doesn't even sound like country to me..deff a bad attempt at it
Mehh...she should've did some ol' Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline & Dolly Parton covera or somethin '. Maybe a duet w/Gillian Welch.
All I heard was Manilow’s Copacabana. Video produced in IMovie 😝
Beyonce, you can do a lot of things. Country is not one of them.
Hey, Smoking
This sucks more ass than a colonoscopy.
No just no
Really love this ❤
Great job , you know , most people don't realize that country Music does have a deep root connection to black american history.. Why anybody would object to her being in this genre? They must be crazy or they must be racist.. It's about time. I hope this grand lady crosses into every genre of music out there. Next I expect to see her on broadway winning a tony good job girl!!!
Boring video
Great song dumb video
The local radio station occasionally sneaks a lil country in on us😂 Congrats Queen B
I like Beyonce but I love country music . I've been listening at it since I was 16 years old. My play list is over 600 or more song from the 80s on up to now. She do some outstanding work but this I can't say is one of them .
Why does she have to be almost naked? Isn't the song good enough on its own?
No way hahahaha
Guess you gotta show of your tits to make a country song
Been sad for a bit that Toby Keith died…now I’m jealous he didn’t have to see what country music has become
Catchy, finely crafted, cliche ridden pablum.   Fans will eat it up.
I had no idea Beyonce was now becoming a gawd damn good country arist til last month best song yet
All the memes were right. It's franklin
Great lyrics but put on some clothes you have a daughter ijs
Beyoncé's new song "Texas Hold 'Em" became the number one Hot Country Song Tuesday, according to Billboard.   are you kidding me ? I love Beyonce but come on.. another pop singer trying to steal real country music singer of their award. The video sucks too :'(
This ain't no damn country song,
I would say in your lane.🤮
She just proved she can do anything! I was a litte shocked at her clothes but then again if i had her voice and looks... id flaunt them. Hell if i looked 1/4 as good as her  id be spectacular. ❤
such crap music...
I think her next song should be titled , THERES GONNA BE A HOEDOWN TONIGHT AND IM THE QUEEN HOE. 😂
cultural appropriation
Good song but the video doesn't fit. And I'm not really a country fan either. Song is a bop tho frfr.
👎👎👎👎It certainly doesn't evoke a country atmosphere. Is she singing  R&B? Because this is far from anything country.
GARBAGE
I love the song but sweetheart why dress that way. You are too beautiful it take all that
Good thing she has that body, but she is just being a skank singing country.  Don't we have enough of those already?
Garbage
Her Talent as a musician should be superseding the fact that she barely has clothes on whoever decided this was a good idea is ridiculous this is so far from what country values truly are I think at her age and with children it's ridiculous that she would feel she needed show skin in this manner. I find it frustrating when people want to be taken seriously in a new genre and then they put garbage of videos up I would never let my 12-year-old watch this Texas Hold'em she should have held on to her clothes and let the talent speak for itself
Horrible video! At least wear country clothes!!
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Funny thing is people saying that it isn't country and almost every song on country stations  sound just like this. I wonder what makes her different...hmm.
Not since Sasha fears, I have ever loved the song better
song sucks sorry
That’s the video ? Yes she’s perfect but …really? No like 😩
Beyoncé cantando  Qualquer estilos de música eh perfeito ❤❤ adorei ela cantando country
Is this actually good, or am I just tripping? Obviously it's not authentic country, but when was the last time that even existed?
I love it!!!
This is the only country singer I'll listen too
Ok so would 1 of the ticktockers who recreate outfits with house hold items ppppppplease do this outfit 😂
Terrible
see this video is sleazy and this is not how country music should be represented,  country song with pop and rap music mentality
Try that song in a small town. See how far you make it down the road.
Not country at all
Love the songs, but the videos? Seriously? 16 Carriages too! WTHeck B!!!!
Just a FYI  us melanated folk started country music.. this a country music tho. That instrumental is..🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️💁🏾‍♀️
Country music was created and inspired by black culture ,don't forget the truth
Great song
What a stupid video!
😂ok
Is this like a new movement? Bleached skin and blonde hair? Real question.
Please do not do that to the real country fans.
Hopefully she gets a grammy this year
It sucked it’s not even country call it what it is a pop song🤷🏼‍♂️
And she's a bit too old to dress like a 20 something
I could only listen for 3 seconds. Her jealousy of Taylor is glowing.
With a voice like that there's nothing she can't do in music.
I assume this is just good old country and not just racist like people are trying to make it Out to be. I am hoping this can be just a damn good voice
Really..........this is garbage.................lol what a joke
I’m not a country music fan, but it sounds pretty good to me- I’ve seen lots of people trashing this song on social media- so I had to come see/hear for myself.   I think it’s a good song, and she looks great, but I don’t care for the video.   I’m not sure if people are pissed because she’s performing a song that’s not her usual genre, or what. I believe that anyone who creates music must evolve/explore/experiment, to further fulfill their need to create. If she’s liking it, and having fun doing it, more power to her.  Edit: I just learned that this isn’t the actual video-  Also learned what “Visualizer” means!😂
i havent liked beyonce in 9 years and this is a career saving album for me
HELL NO FROM THESE DEMON
Beyonce is not country this might sound country but you can put lipstick on a hog but it won't make it pretty.
New favorite song 🎧
Straight asss
This isn’t a good cowboy video. It gives cowboys a bad name. Put some clothes on!! 0:35
Turned the music off and watched the video about 10 times
Horrible video needs to do better
Gosh she is so overrated 😂 just add banjos and call it country huh lol this is a joke
Beautiful voice such grace & power God bless you Beyonce keep up the awesome work proud of you you come so far 😇🙏🍀🥰
What an insult to real country music.
Terrible
Completely garbage I give it a .5/10 being generous...
Not a fan of Beyoncé’s music this song hasn’t changed my mind. But I respect what she has achieved over the years.
This is not country music
This is awful 👀
Not that good she has better its like sex
This is complete garbage. Awful
Wtf is this  bullshit.   Straight  trash
This is wank
I thought cultural appropriation was a bad thing 😂
Well.  I guess. Younk Ce  ran out of music ideas. 🤣😂.  Now she singing Hoe  down  songs.  🤦🏾‍♀️😂🤣.   This song is horrific. 🤦🏾‍♀️
As a country music fan I wanted to like this song but I don’t. I think it’s more the song. It’s not her it’s just the song sucks
What a damn boring video ... song is ok .. good swap to your usual rubbish past few years Beyonce
Horrible, imo but I'm not a country fan so what do I know
It needs something else. It’s boring to me. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Can we admit she sucks now
About as country as all the other fake news country performers currently.
Boring
3 second clip on repeat....yawn!
I love this song. I can keep listening to it over n over.  Number #1 song all year come-on with it.  Get it country girl 🎤 much love from Floyd County Kentucky ❤
Sooo LOVE the song. Love BEyoncé....LOATH the video....she looks great but WHY do we need that much flesh?
What happened to creativity? That’s all they could come up with for a video for this song?
Huhhhh Mama Knowles!!
Geez she’s nearly naked. Horrible video. Stupid song but of it’s #1 because she’s got to be #1 in everything!
Shits trash
This is not country
Who said this is country?  It absolutely is not.  Catchy but not country music.
Stupid video
Tired of hearing about her being from Texas, so what? Pantera is from Texas too and they’re not country! Although after Pantera minus Phil joined DAC for the Rebel Meets Rebel album/band, it wasn’t country but the influences were there unlike this nonsense. And if you don’t know who DAC you most definitely are not country!
She sang about Whiskey and a Dive bar so that definitely makes it Country😅  But in all seriousness, this just doesn't seem like country to me.  Yes, it is very catchy, and it gets stuck in your head, so I'd say it's a good song. Just don't feel like it should've made it to the #1 Country Song charts.   Regardless of opinion,  congrats Beyonce for a new hit!
dressed like a street walker this isn't country
As we live in country song this is no for me……
Sounds like a Dolly Parton song on steroids. It’s catchy. The video? Gawd it’s awful.
This song is absolutely horrible. Leave country to the country artist.
Dang she's stack... packing more than just a 6 shooter I see. Congrats JayZ
Perfect because all new Country SUKKKKKSSSSSSS 🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑
Garbage
could you be any lazier in making a video???
👍🏽✌🏽🫶🏽🇺🇲
That video on loop is ALL she needs.
This feels more like a parody. I can't take it seriously..also a bit poppy but it is catchy so I'm sure it will do well in the dance halls. Probably fun to dance to. I feel like this is Beyonce saying "tell me what else I can't do boys....who's next?"
Nobody honestly thinks this is country.
Love Beyonce but not this song. Country music typically tells a story, this is all over the place. Im not sure how this is a chart topper??? but I doubt it will be there long.
She's singing over a country beat not singing country at all but the song is nice 😅
Where’s the country part?
R&B not country and its terrible
Time 🕰️❤️https://youtu.be/OpzE3ogeq2c?si=0C7q_H1eJ2oFVQY-
Definitely not country music
I ❤ Beyonce Periodt & WHAT⁉️❣️
Actually country music, southern music and bluegrass all began with the Irish, Scottish,  English & West Africans...who then evolved it into the American sounds, including the blues!!!
Terrible
Country music brought back my child memories. I love country music ❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sux
Ok Mrs Carter Unite This Country ❤❤❤❤
Just...no
Song:🔥🔥🔥🔥 Video: huh?!?!?!?
Give the song a pass -but seriously dressing like a 304 is outta tune   If this is the official video? Able
This isn't country, this is pop with a banjo and some key words. Big difference.
So many views... lol.. that means nothing. I bet more than half were disappointed in this mess. C'mon Beyonce, you can do better than this surely.
Wonder what would have happened if this song was played incognito 😮
A MESS!
This is pop country at best
And she strikes again! 👩🏽‍🌾
I like this!
She might be from Texas but we don’t claim her.  Pure trash.
SICK
Franklin
I’m sorry but this is bollocks , this ain’t no country video , has dolly Parton and Randy travis heared about this disgrace of an “country song and video”
This IS NOT country!
Trash
Um no
Im a huge Beyonce fan, so everything she does sounds amazing to me ! ❤❤❤❤
This is not bad and the beat is a beast to me,now let me see the line dance lol 😂, this may be a new project for someone who may have wrote this for Beyonce to sing. It's different and I like it,some of her new music was a miss for me. As a Truck Driver I can't listen to a lot of her new music lol 😂 it just don't keep me up. Now the old songs most definitely,her old music got sick beats... your body would just move to whatever that feels can move the body & make it go " BUMP BUMP BUMP" 😆😆
This Shit is a joke right lol
I don’t like it…she sounds like she does in all her other songs,  nothing unique about this song.. hopefully her other songs are better..
The outfit is horrible.
I like this..at least is not trashy n racist..
She needs to go on with this bullshit....it's not even country
This is not country lol
This is not fucking country at all. What a disgrace.
This isn’t country it’s Americana
I'm lost ! This crap got to the #1 spot on the charts ??? She needs to stay in her own area of music! This is pitiful at best least I heard it once now I don't need to hear it again !! Wow what a shit show of absolute garbage !!
She sounds and looks like She Ra
Sooo, if I sing a country song to rap music: is it a rap song? Nope. This is not country music.
I didn’t want to love it but I do 😅
Sleezy bad view of country singers especially women! What happened to her pop persona ? Must be running from Taylor Swift!  The nastier the language the sadder her noise gets! To bad she has no class!
This is not country. Just pure cringe.
This is TRUE TEXAS QUEEN B !!Yall take notice. Spectacular Women.Houston Texas. PROUD..LIO GALVESTON...cowgirl yeah
Sounds like chatgpt did this
Hey its Fraaaanklin! - Bruce Cockburn - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyIhmbfdrMU
This ain’t country.
Ya'll will come for me but I liked the song about the watermelon much better
George jones and Randy Travis probably wouldn’t be famous nowadays if they were just discovered
This song sounds stupid
🗑️🗑️🗑️
So because its called texas holdem and has a banjo its country there is absolutely nothing country in this
Too me three times watching this to realise theres a song in the background 😂
I'm actually impressed the views are so low for this 9 days and not over 6m yet 😂
Dress like a stripper then say yee haw and all of a sudden you be country. Nope.
gross
Like Aaron Lewis said that shit ain’t country!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pulls out cowboy boots*
WTF?  Most stupid video I've ever wasted time watching. She trying to even the score with Swifty?  Stick to ghetto hippity-hop twirkity twirking genre because country "ain't your thang.
Could she put some clothes on. If you can't use your talent to gain attention, hey show your skin. It's disgusting.
Nothing bout this is representative of country 😡 what a bad joke 😂😂😂
Oh…I like country now 🫢💕
Just gotta put some trash talk in it….should have known she couldn’t just sing a country song without trashing it up.
Just wanna say a big congratulations to ChatGPT and Beyonce's team of writers for putting out yet another song that rhymes and has lyrics.
Song sucks.
Dumbest video i have ever seen.
Just another example of people will do anything to make that money 🤑💰😆😆😆
Not a huge fan of her, but this is genius.
Steaming pile of shit
Dog sheet
This is more Taylor Swift pop.  I wouldn't really call it country.
Why does she have to be naked to sing⁉️⁉️
WTF
This ain't country. This ain't good music.
Yummy beautiful woman Beyonce is 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
She is running out of ideas on music, so now she has to cross over. This is probably one of the dumbest songs of all time.
Country is a way of life there is no color in it it's about respect love harmony and respect nature😊
Nice little nod to Illuminati in the opening sequence, one eye is flashing.. no wonder she got number one for this trash
streaming equivalents were created so songs like this can debut at number one on the billboard chart without anyone spending any money on it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not for me but i respect it. I cant stand 99% of country so im not the one to say if its good or not but mor artists should feel less "in a box". I just hate it when they experiment with an etire album. Like give the fans you already have what they pay for and play around in a few tracks with new ideas.
I wish singers would stop using guns to normalize shootings.
Good grief! 🤦‍♀️
This is so boring!
AS a black country music fan this is not REAALLY a country  song but its clever... its a beat with a country  guitar sample on it im listening to Jason Aldean right now you can tell the difference
Illuminate  symbols in this.    Trying infiltrate the country scene to manipulate  young minds.   THIS AINT COUNTRY MUSIC!
Renaissance Random
🤦🏾‍♀️the things people do instead of continuing to be themselves and wait on God to deliver.
I'm not saying it's bad but this isn't country music. She can sing and it's not a bad song but I don't know if it's actually "country" just because it has a guitar melody and says "Texas" 20x.
Beautiful as always ❤️
That is most horrible and most boring video I have ever seen. Sorry. But that's just stupid. I didn't even watch the whole thing.
This don't feel country 😅
This is not country.
She is going to take off like a missle with this. This slaps so hard.
😂 it's the Franklin The Turtle theme song. What a crook...😮
Nothin like trashing country music!
Total 💩💩💩💩
This does not sound like country OMg it's just sounds like one of beys great songs
This is so bad 😂
That's not country 🤣🤣🤣 that's drunk r&b karaoke
Not a country or pop music fan, I’m a rocker, but this is really good 👍
it is a good song but not my kind of country music but I will say it is catchy
Great voice, no need to be half naked
As country music as putin is America
Immer Brüste zeigen und sich dann über sexuelle Belästigung beschweren. Ne, is klar. Der Song an sich ist gut.
Take back what we created Beyoncé
Yasssss Bey❤❤❤Country I’m all in❤
THIS AINT COUNTRY!!!!
this song sucks
Beyoncé voice just put class in country, and I’m not a country fan.
Country music goes this way - I’m out. Country fan all my life and this is not Country.
Sound like R&B .....no bellowing ....no sign of slight depression...no twain....no nothing ....
Wow, what a load of shit. Shitty song. Over sexualized outfit. Pushing AI/Transhumanist agenda.
Just gonna say it... this song sucks 👎 video is just as bad
This isn't country music at all...
What does this video have to do with Country... And The first words... THIS ISN'T TEXAS...But she's from TEXAS...The Bitch Word Isn't Part of Country Music 🎵 🎶...Dive Bars...😮😅😂😂😂
This isn't country music at all.
stupid
Sucks just like the rest of this popcountry shit! Disappointing.
What am I missing. 🗑️
Not a Beyoncé fan or a country fan. But the production alone on this track sounds better than any other modern country song I’ve heard. She did her thing on this one, this is great
,
This isn't country...
I do like the song, but I don’t care for the video
I`m waiting, if here at us in Germany, she will make a song with brass music........
Lousy video
I'm African American and love country music. I also love this song. She sounds better singing country to me♥️
Omgosh she couldn’t come out with an original background beat or anything she had to Take Franklins beat from the show 🤦🏻‍♀️
She was tired of Taylor taking the spotlight and this is obviously the solution. It's a brave attempt but you're definitely not Taylor.
“Country” ……
This is not country!
I dont know if I hate the lyrics or what she is NOT wearing more. Disgusting honestly.
Trash country
It's a big ass hell nawl 😅😂😂
STILL NOT A FAN OF HER SORRY YOU CAN KEEP THIS ISH
Unpopular opinion, I'm not a swiftie either, but I think she's tired of losing to Taylor in the pop genre. 😮 I prefer her other music honestly.
Fuck is this?
this is nothing but porn
It doesn't sound like a country
Wow, just wow! Ya, hard no girl!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
The song is fine but there are many African-American great vocalist in country music and thank God they have class this video is distasteful and to be honest it does nothing for me the song that is
are any taylor swifts using the snake on her sunglasses as a theory they have a duet coming?!
This ain’t country she just put a country beat on her same sound
It's Franklin!
Whats going on with this song? Lol
This shit is horrible, like what in the world 😂😂😂😂 I’m a fan of country music. You Beyoncé fans just praise her for anything and it’s really sad!
Make it make sense though.
❤
Trash 🗑
Yes it's different, that ain't country music! Stay with your pop culture and stop contamination...
I can’t 😂
This ain’t country, and the video, smh.
She’s definitely not country and I don’t consider that song being sung country. Thumbs down.
First of all…this is not country music. Secondly, it’s terrible irregardless of any genre.  I had to come here to hear this song. I’ve not heard it on ANY country stations I’ve listened to.  How does a song that is trash and doesn’t get played on country stations shoot to one on Country Billboard Charts?
Hate it
Sometimes the lyrics tell the truth and folks don't like to be confronted with reality, just ask any trump fan.
If this is country then rock is rap
Hahah this is so terrible! Is this like a desperation from all black people to reclaim “ all that is there’s”
Wow such a creative video!!! I'm impressed!!
If this is country then I am a french fry😂😂😂
Let me go listen to Tennessee whiskey
Eso fue todo ?
This song is boring. The clip is awful.
Leave beyonce. I mean brittany.  I mean budlight the fck alone!
😳🤦🏻‍♀️
This song is trash lol .. no soul to it and generic
Ha, great, a country themed strip club act. Can't wait till she does an album of traditional Chinese love songs.
I like country music as much as I did before which wasn't much at all and probably a little less
Heeeeey it's franklinnnnn
Thats not  country music, it's cuntry music.....also sound like th he theme from Franlin the turtle..
What’s with the boobs
This is fuckin trash!! Definitely not country
I like the song. But do we really need to see her breasts?
country sucks and this is WAAAAAAAY  worse than I expected and don't need to see a half-naked cow
Why is this video so low effort though?
Oof
All hat no cattle.
You rock it girl you are breaking stereotyping and country belongs to everybody thats wants to do it.❤
LMAO!!😂😂😂😂
Hopefully someone that has decision making power reads this: I’ve never been a Beyoncé fan, but I really enjoy this song.  It’s unique and new and will almost certainly spark the creation of a middle ground new genre of music.  So, let’s address the elephant in the room.  5.9 million views after 9 days is a joke for a powerhouse like Beyoncé.  And I’m betting there’s a lot of financially interested parties scratching their heads and wondering what’s happening. The answer is easy.  Someone made the mistake of marketing this music as “Country”.  Trust me, I’m an open minded and moderately intelligent guy, and I understand why some people instructed marketing to do what they did, but that choice was short sighted.  It’s likely people thought that they could “break into the country music market” and tap the well (so to speak) for financial reasons.  I could explain at length why that was a terrible idea, but suffice it to say that, without playing armchair analyst too much, I could have confidently explained how the best way to name the genre was to let the public decide.  Controversy was NOT the way to let this artwork become known. It’s great though.  I hope this gets the adoration it deserves.  I may even have some ideas on how to salvage the poor marketing decisions.  Good luck 🧐👏😎
This isn't country!
I’m sorry, but this is just a really STUPID repetitious video!     The same thing can be said for the song!
It's not the worse thing I heard. I won't say I'm a fan but it's honestly not bad so far the stuff doesn't deserve half the hate it's getting. Better than a lot of some of the modern stuff in country which unfortunately a lot of modern country music sucks but I guess I'm spoiled on pre 911 country music.
Sorry what a crap video
Love it!!! Running to get my hat and boots!😂🔥❤️
Welp...time to see how Reddit's handling this...
What happened to her clothes....yikes
THIS ISNT COUNTRY!!!!
This is so fuckin bad 🤣
shes trying to be white
Move over swifties😅😅😅😅😅😅
Nah….. this ain’t country music it’s that fake wanna be pop country a lot of people are doing today and calling it country music…. Now imagine if a real country singer started doing RnB imagine all the complaints the fans of RnB/pop would be spewing…. It just doesn’t fit…. This is pandering to get album of the year and it won’t happen.   Just like Hip Hop….country music is a culture….. and if you don’t rep and respect the culture….you’re a leech. Just saying.
Best country song I've heard in a long time you go girl
🔥🔥🔥
That dam sure not country 👎
Um half naked I’m a country fan she needs to stay away from country this video is werid no doubt she’s a beautiful woman but the video is boring !
True roots are in The Delta. John Lee Hooker. Sam Cooke. So many others. Love to see her give that a whirl…
This ain't real country music this just sounds like Beyonce
Those boob jobs are expensive
The country music artists  are in shock that outfit is terrible😢
😂
Country music is 🤮 not a fan of it what so ever, it sounds so bland 😅
The video on a loop though 🧐
It's SO bad. 😂
Omgoodness this song sucks donkey ⚾️⚾️
I think taylor has a good career ahead of her if she dosent sell out
People who think this is a country song has probably never heard an actual country song.
BEYONCE THANK YOU MY SISTER IM A WHOLE GANGSTER BUT EVERY TIME ME AND PARTNERS HEAR THIS SONG WE DOSI DO.....WE DO THE COUNTRY ELECTRIC SLIDE AND ALL
I'm getting Hannah Montana "Hoedown Throwdown" vibes.
Great voice, catchy lyric, but real country is not focusing on the "kitty" and breasts. There is a better way to do the right thing! (1 Corinthians 6:9-11)
https://youtu.be/-Zf8t-uAzhk?si=2zDCo6ghlfPPaXpQ
This is just sad....
😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
We don’t need this sick vulgarity in country music. Stick to your rap.
She cant sing anything without being half naked,
That sounds good to me, YEEEEEHA!
Amazing what money buys. The only reason she is number 1 is because of all her regular fans. This song isnt country in the least bit.
Awful 😂
hold on  this to change the Ecenary ? D  play
Is this a joke?!? 😂😂😂 she’s really reaching for her Grammy!! LMAOOO   Is that her country moves? Pow pow…🤣🤣
AI generated country music.
Trash but still her best song lol
OK that guitar picking intro is fantastic. I didn't expect to stay for the whole song but yeah this is good. So much new country drags & stumbles..this has that ditty feel 🤠
This is bad. Slapping music onto her vocal isn’t country. The song isn’t country in any other way.  It’s only top chart bc of her fanbase. Thank god Taylor went to pop and took over and now B wants to come to country and take over, they both are overrated musicians.  Just stick to R&B and pop where she succeed in it.
this shit is terrible
❤❤❤❤❤ LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEAM BEY 🤩
It’s the same thing over and over, wth 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👹
Wow this is great! So talented Ms. Beyonce is!
Can't wait to here all the racist bullsh*t directed at Country fans and artists.  They will except Beyonce long before the hypocritical Hip Hop industry Em as the GOAT.  I know one thing for sure, you wont here the likes of Garth Brooks and Shania Twain tell Beyonce she's not welcome in Country culture like all the pricks in the Rap game saying Em can't be top 5 because he's white.
This lady right here can do no wrong,  at this point she has the licence to do whatever she wants.  Queen B 👸  this is awesome 👌 👏 👍
This is one of the worst songs I've ever heard.
County is so outdated
Whats country about this ?
L A M E
It all went diwnhill after achey breakey
I feel like this video is just selling sex, but hay I'm not made at her.  I wish it focused more on her talent.
Headed to the dive bar? She's never stepped foot in a dive
Are you effin' kidding me? Sooooooo NOT country.  Have you ever heard a REAL country song or is this just your impression of what you think about country folks. Just stay in your lane.  You seem to have a decent grasp of what is happening in your genre. You are dangling on the edge with Bud Light by making fun of country people. FAFO
Beyoncé is really the greatest
Meh
She is amazing but I wish she would put more clothes on and keep it tasteful and little more modest
This video isn’t country music style. Ew what? This isn’t class. And when did Beyoncé ever care about country music? Nothing comes from the heart or anything with the song, regardless if it’s fun.
Garbage
Tried again, still hate it. Terrible.
She could have done without the nearly naked costume.she has the voice and didn't need all that to sell it.
In country music , we wear clothes Bey...
I wouldn’t really consider this country music. But I do like it
heyyy its franklin
While I like Beyonce, she really needs to back off country. And this music is crap when you compare her to country singers like Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Mickey Guyton,Chapel Hart, Jimmie Allen, Randy Travis, Kane Brown, Willie Nelson, Reba, Charlie Pride, Charlie Rich, Darrius Rucker, Aaron Neville, Brittney Spence, Blanco Brown and Johnny Cash etc... There is no comparison to these and many other country singers. Just because you were born or from the south does not mean you can sing country.
No comment…..
Love beyonce, the song is amazifn as well but this doesnt sound like country im confused ?
Total trash. Cultural appropriation.
What a stupid video and song! OMG
This aint no country, the hell
All I hear now is the Franklin Theme Song and I’m expecting the “HEEEEEY ITS FRANKLIN COMIN OVER TO PLAAAAY!”
Nope.
This sucks
The song is great but the video is terrible! It is low budget and same clip over and over. Beyoncé is so talented. Why did she allow this awful video??
I like Beyonce,  but gotta say I don't like this.  Her voice just doesn't go well with what she's trying to do.  Plus i just don't like the song.  Good try Bey.
Is that the actual video? There's nothing to it. The lyrics seem to be stuck on repeat. Not much to them either. I expected a lot better.
I mean, it's OK but give me Lainey Wilson all day long.
I think people forget that Beyonce is from Texas and is a little bit country. Do your thang lady...I love an artist who's not afraid to try new things. "Y'all" don't forget that country music was stolen from the blues and btw, I love true country music but I love a fearless woman more!
Tittays!  Thank you Bey!
ITS PEOPLE LIKE HER AND A FEW OTHERS THAT HAVE RUNIT SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CARE ABOUT Y CANT YOU ALL KEEP YOUR STUPID SHIT IN YOUR VENUE WOULNT MAKE A PIMPLE ON DOLLYS ASS
Beyoncé nunca erraaaaa, te amo diva
Not country 😐
Just can't keep her clothes on or make a clean video.
You gotta be shitting me country my ass some kind of hip hop happy horseshit it sucks
Sex sure sells!!!  Shame as.the song ain't no country (even with contrived banjo and violin!)  I almost prefer Shania Twain...  Pete Woodroffe Music UK
The only country song I’ll listen to
They call this country? This ain’t country.
I bet an unplugged version would be cool!
Check out my new country song
Country music died a long time ago
It's a cute song. Not great, but she hasn't put out anything good since irreplaceable.
Is this the actual video? I like the song but this video is weird
❤❤❤❤love the song F y’all
this song sucks
Ummm this is the absolute worst video I have ever seen. And putting Texas in the song doesn't make it country. Or a little banjo or whatever the hell that is. The song isn't the worst I've heard but it is not country. 🤣 Clearly all these people saying they don't listen to country don't know that, but this AINT country.
That actually isn't bad for a debut song an the country charts. Interesting choice but I think she pulled it off pretty good.
Country trash
Her husband bashed Taylor for winning again and she went country! Laughable
This ain’t country…. No hate to her she’s a good artist but this is not country.
Country is dead.
You think this is a history class? Who gives a damn about the roots of country music? We are here to listen to a song, not being told of "Beyonce was seen as reclaiming country music and bringing it back to its black roots". Beyonce was not in proper attire as a supposed country artist; looking as if she loved being almost naked with parts of her breasts on display in this video, shaking like they were fake while we are listening to the song... Man, what a lazy work for an official visualizer! Yeah, whatever. When a song is bad, it's bad. Period!
Pechugas ricas😊
Horrible. This isn't country music and using cuss words in songs is ignorant
I'm a Texan, and she brought me back to my roots. Thanks, Beyonce!
Makes about as much sense as anything else out there. NONE!!! Just a bunch of repeated idiotic phrases. 🤬💩
This song is awful.. not catchy at all
Black peoples invented country so…. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Country`s cool again , L.W
It's not country music,but none of today's country music is true country music,listen to Waylon,Merle,Conway, Dolly and Loretta and George Jones if you want to know what country music is supposed to sound like
100% not country. This is trash
Don't like the outfit
This and Tennessee whiskey my favorite country songs
What can be more worse than a Beyoncé song? A Beyoncé country song
Just because anyone sings about Texas doesn't make it COUNTRY MUSIC!!
Not gonna comment on how good or bad the song is, but it’s definitively not country
She proved a point for sure 🙄
Best song ever ❤❤❤
This is terrible.
Fabulous B
WTF is this sh*t and this ridiculous "video"????  I can't stop laughing 😅😅😅
Wow.... if she thinks this caliber of music is going to help her secure her first album of year award. She is delusional.  All the people who think this is a great country song doesnt listen to country mudic.
This is country? Why because it has a banjo?
What a terrible song 🤣🤣🤣
I gave it a chance 🥴🥱🥱🥱🥱
Beyonce not dancin!
This is awesome! a game changer for music and music artists all around
So is it the music that makes it country or the voice?
This is horrible. Wow.
This is not country
This song ass
Definitely not country….
Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!!!! 💤💤💤
This is “country” music.  This shouldn’t even count.
OK first off, she does not belong in country music, this video is garbage, her outfit is distasteful for country completely amd I am not a fan of hers to begin with but I really am not a fan of this at all and don't care who this pisses off. John is completely right.
this song sucks how the hell did she get #1 horseshit...
I never was a country music fan.  But hearing her sing this song, .......lol I now am❤
WTF is this fraudulent garbage! 😂😂😂
This is absolutely trash......
I gotta say, before this morning, I would have adamantly said that I don’t have a damn thing in common with Country Music fans, (and I live on a farm LOL) but now I’m questioning everything. Look at Beyoncé making people question their own preconceived notions. You trying to bring people together with that honey voice Queen B? I LOVE IT! Count me in! Yeehaw! 😂🤠❤
What did country ever do to you? Please for the love of everything 🛑
I like the song but that is the most boring video I have ever seen.
She’s got the goods and such a beautiful voice… ❤
2016 That Nobody Told You , beyonce Dixie chicks 2003  and bush war , cancellation about policy
The outfit is ridiculous, so inappropriate. Country has more class
This is some bluegrass ish. Gimme more.❤
She came and tried to do something different. It is and will go down as an epic fail! It isn’t country just because you added a twang. No story, rap lyrics and poor choice of wardrobe. I’m disappointed and expected more from her.
What a dumb song..... 😂😂😂
Good tune but it's not country
Idk what that song is, but it aint fucking country, aint no country person driving around in a fucking Lexus.
Oh Beyonce I had high hopes for you girl.  Big nope!
Much better without the video, but also better than much of a lot of what passes as Country these days.
Choice of costume definitely needed to be reconsidered.
Meu Deus eu estou gostando de música country(o sertanejo deles).Me perdoe por favor.
This song sends a bad reputation towards country music. If yall aren't true country, then won't understand. You can't put on a boot and put on a cowboy hat and call yourself country. Because that's not how it works. You have to understand how to become country instead of faking it.
Did you listen to song lyrics or your eyes are on her boob!
Gross
I think there’s a glitch. Just looping 😂 stupid. Listen to something good like Chapel Hart. This is crap
This is better than all that mainstream pop country coming out of Nashville, but it still doesn’t sound right.
I like this song
Tbh I don't care if it is Country or not. It's catchy. The End.
Poor struggle Artist... Fund Beyonce a BRA! Victoria Secret!
I think I can predict what she will do next!  Let me see... I think she'll slowly raise up her arm, use her hand like a gun, and blow the smoke off her fingers.
Just what we needed...more T & A in country. What a dud of a vocal. Anyone else would never get this released...well, maybe if they had the same T & A appeal...
Beyonce ventures into hat pop ...
Yep, whoring up country music and not just her !
Who's the genius that came up with this music video on a loop?
Just no.
Hey it's Franklin....
https://youtu.be/b1Z4PAZX9Bs?si=moKQ-uoyCqpHsN-D
Ashame any woman will parade herself round half naked to make sales or she's that untalented that she has to be half naked so I couldn't even get past first part of video I hate the song hate the video
This is not country at all
No..this is not Country.
OMG,  the Texas Rodeo, in her home town and mine is going to explode, as a Texan already was a fan from the beginning and now showing some more of those roots. Awesome
This ain't country music
Hard pass
Put your clothes on
I sort of like it I just wish it wasn’t all about her boobs
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rhiannon Giddons, Carolina Chocolate Drops is the real deal. This is pop with a banjo
It's rubbish and the video is totally rubbish must have taken all of 5 minutes to make shows how interested she is to become a country star lol she's just targeting people where the money is she's just greedy
It's a country beat but RnB song
Not a bad attempt
What an embarrassment to country music. CHAPEL HART is more talented than Beyonce.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First off, this is not country. This is country hip-hop. It's not the worst, definitely better than her straight hip-hop career.  Maybe put a little more clothing when you do this in person live. Could do without the Cyborg looking eye wear. Not sorry to say it but She'll never be able to do a full 100% country album because she's just not country and doesn't have the emotional experiences to pull off pure real country.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
HORRIBLE!!!!!! 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
You're kidding, right? If naming a song after gambling card games makes it country, then Pokerface by Lady Gaga is also country, except no, it's not. This is more ridiculous than Ben Shapiro featuring in a rap song that made #1 on iTunes or whatever. I've never been one to say "that ain't country" about any song that doesn't have banjos or whatever the old school country lovers say but it is painfully obvious that this is not a country song. This gives me the ick... 😬
Yeah it's diffy
Trash.
Trash. Not Class. Country hack. Real country girls are modest, not slutty l. And this song is not country.
Is this a joke 😂😂 At her fame level she could probably just snore to the beat and people will swear it’s the greatest song ever 🤣🤣
Beyonce is not Country.....Nice try though 😂
Nope 🤣
Remember when Beyoncé was hating on Post Malone for doing country? But that’s none of my business lol
I'm here for it! 🎉❤
This ain’t country! 😅😅😅😅
I’d love to hear her voice with just a acoustic version
Sounds a lot like Rhiannon Giddens, who is actually playing banjo on the song…  Check out her earlier stuff as well as her work with the Carolina Chocolate Drops, it’s very similar to this, if you like Beyonces’ new song
This is more country than most modern country! Is the rest of the album similar?
Congratulations to Rick Flair for getting on the track. Whooo!
Gonna be some made folks
😂😂 Tom MacDonald got more views then she got with Ben Shapiro on "Facts".  FYI DAX has more subscribers than she has. But Dax Sold one of his songs to a record deal but he's still good.   When an artist has to change their musician  preferences from hip hop to country then she is going down hill. FYI  Putting her as a country artist  devices people she is a damn hip hop artist. If the only way you can make it big on a chart is to call yourself something else then what you have been all these years  than you are a loser.  Tom MacDonald didn't call himself a country artist when  he sang with John
Garbage 🗑️
I love the song and her voice is perfect for it. But, not so much the semi-nudity, doesn’t jive with country.
The more the country stations hate on Bey, the more this song will get large.
Looks like ahe keeps pulling 2 fingers out here snatch and taking a wiff
Same  peep show,  different  genre. 😐
bob wills and the boys would be rolling in their graves
This is a mix of folk and gospel
Bad ass Queen Bey. Unstoppable. went Country on y'all white azz. ❤❤❤❤💪🏾💪🏾✌🏽
I’m a country music fan. But not sure how many I want to hear her sing country. This is ok but once or twice is enough. Doesn’t feel genuine.
If you’re a black pop singer and you think you can actually do a country song….good, do it! I’ve been listening to country my entire life, I dig it, catchy song sung by one of the best singers in my lifetime.  Not sure why we have to pigeon hole artist into one specific genre or category. I ain’t no bitch, I like the song plain and simple 😁
Wow this song freaking sucks.. goes to show music went to hell 😂😂
THIS ISNT COUNTRY! ANYONE SAYING SO DOESNT KNOW COUNTRY!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stick to what you do and leave trying to be country to the real country.
Whia this is straight old school country, nice. ❤
What's the big deal? So she isn't known as a country artist. So she's  a huge pop artist? So she's black?  I'd hope that the music would be judged on its own merits, not because of who Beyoncé is.   The song is catchy, has a good beat to dance to, and sounds like a lot of the current songs out there now. Traditionalists will scream that it ain't REAL COUNTRY, and they would be right; it isn't "Coal Miner's Daughter," and it isn't supposed to be. It's in line with the stuff coming out now. Does that make it bad? No.  Has Beyoncé decided to leave Pop and turn into a Country artist? She would be crazy to do it, so I would say no. But she decided to spread her wings and go in a different direction. Believe me, she has that right. Is that a bad thing? Nope.   Listen to it, or don't. I think its ok, for a first shot.   Bravo!!
What's with her appropriating long blonde hair?????
I like this Bey!!!!
Yeah..... No..... Seems like were trying to hard too hit all the country grocery store items...
new mutation
Wow, totally through me off at the beginning. I didn't know it was B until YouTube video
Give me Charley Pride any day
❤🇧🇷
Trash!!!!
We are all here feel like we born and raised in texas😅😅
👎👎🏿
That's not country. I wanna know how many dive bars Beyonce sat in the back of playing an acoustic guitar...Posers unite
Is that a video or a GIF
Like the music, video is disappointing
lol @ the Grammy reach. Desperation.
How is this country?
And I love this because it's pissing all those gotdam racist TrumpetHeads off 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She is so desperate 😅… now it’s a little country so she can feel like she will get a Grammy 😢 poor beyHive
Shout out to Montgomery Gentry ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Go back to pop/rap/r&b. Can’t put on a cowboy hat and call yourself country, doesn’t work like that boo boo
022024.. Beyoncé has become the first Black woman artist ever to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart in the modern history of country music, thanks to her country debut “Texas Hold ‘Em,” which also opened at Number Two on the Hot 100, the publication announced on Tuesday.
Many years I've seen the women in the country music industry I've never seen them expose them selfs at all everything isnt about S E X
No. Just NO.
Franklin the turtle?
beurkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk je préfère l'original ; en plus pas besoin d'être à poil pour chanter
This is the most embarrassing shit I've seen in 2024
Pretty boring video though.
It doesn't even sound country 🤷‍♀️
I think most country  music  singers wear  more clothes up top
Visual😂 is funny.
CLASSIC 🔥🔥🔥
Sorry this is not country it is a mash of blues good try no cigar.
Tornados? Basement? This bitch is crazy lol
Hey it’s Franklin!
Grat talent❤
I do like the song but the outfit seems way over the top for a country video.  Honestly I can’t stand the video.  I’m sure she could have come up with a much better video instead of this one.
There aint nothing country about this stupid ass song. Just an attempt at trying to be relevant again.
This sounds more like actual Country music than what is being passed around as “Country” today, and the best part is that it’s pissing off all of the bro country hicks who like Jason Aldean
I like it
Stick to your day job sweetie… This song sucks 👎🏼
Here’s my two cents. Granted Beyoncé doesn’t rap, but she’s married to one and knows some of the unwritten rules. For example, one can’t “gangsta rap” if you don’t live that lifestyle. How can Beyoncé do country if she’s never lived that lifestyle? Just saying…
I was looking in one place all the time 😂😂
Gotta be kidding. Most Country singers wear clothes. She DOES not have the vibe for this genre.
🤮🤮🤮
Lame video. Seriously you've got a great voice but in your videos you don't respect yourself enough to do something more creative than this?!? You're tired!
She is a joke.  Trying to be like Taylor Swift.
aff
This is awful.
This... 😬isnt country music
Dang this was awful go back to the other crap you do!
Weeeee doggy Elmer that aint it
She Wants Grammys Like Taylor Swift 😅
Just another way the Illuminati can gain power and money! She’s Texan but far from Country! It’s all for money and fame but why not keep your legacy true and not look desperate! I give it a 3/10 but I’m nobody to judge just sayin why does everyone want to join country music that doesn’t even support it let alone ever lived it just for a paycheck! It’s definitely a time of greed and spurious people trending in the good ol USofA! 🇺🇸🤑
This a joke right? 😂🤣🤣 😂
This is the absolute worst 😫 thing I ever heard
Sometimes it's nice to know you'll never have to be around famous people.
Im not a B fan but I've been streaming this because I remember being 23 and ppl told me I couldn't be a model. I ended up modeling for Andrew Christian underwear. Get it B!!!!-Tye Hilgeman. Gay guy from South Dakota that grew up country.
Stay in your lane, this isn't working!!
It doesn't seem it took long to make this video
This just reminds me of the movie Dream Girls... her as herself and Jamie is Jay Z
Nope
No… just… no
This aint country music.
This is awful
No.
I'll bet it took 3 minutes and $10 to film this entire video. The song sucks and the video is stupid.
Yo this shit is pop with country instrumental WTF
This isn’t country😭😭😭
This is NOT "country music". What a SCAM on the public. You can put any song to a "country music" beat. That doesn't make it country music. Proof how stupid the consumers really are.
I like the song but I would like to hear Gretchen Wilson, Miranda lambert or Reba it needs some twang to it
So pretty
Good song but disgusting costume!
I can not hear real C&W nowhere. At least, not my style.
What a disgrace for what she is wearing that is a slap in face for country music you do not need dress as such but country singers class you do not the song sounds pop show some class would you if you want other country singers to take you serious then dress right
Thats a #1 country hit. Carry Underwood and Tader Shift better watch out. There's a new sheriff in town.
Who’s crying about cultural appropriation now! This is pure crap.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂nope she still not going to win a grammy for this wen you try to hard majority of the time it dont workout. Tanner song is better than this Illuminati devil crap ijs.
OK the Queen just made me fall in love with country music..wow
Not sure if I'd call it country but I don't hate it....
To know  how great an artist truly is, take a song they dish out like its their first and see if your appreciation still stands.  This ish 🔥 🔥 🤠 👢 🐎
Cover up girl! U r a role model for your daughters! Is that what u want blue to b seeing???
No one: Beyonce: I made a country song
Is this supposed to be a video by a "SUPERSTAR"...  And this song has no country sound/vibe whatsoever...
H-town 🔥🔥🔥
Trying to pervert country now
Her nipples must literally be at the side of her boobs, she was literally hanging out and still no nipple 😮
This doesn’t even sound like a country song🤦🏻‍♀️. 😂😂😂 Stick with hip hop please…
Isn't it that the Democrats are trying to get the Texan in their pocket?
Anyone else wondering where the hell her nipples are?? l
Gospel pop with a banjo for effect
Beyoncé is continuing many long and proud traditions of Texans in the entertainment industries.  So many Texans seem to have propensities of composing, and singing songs about the 🇺🇸 State of Texas as the primary subject matters 🤓🤓🤓😀😀😀.
Yikes. Could only make it 1 min. This aint it girl.
I guess Drake will be doing a gospel album next.
I’m sorry this is not close to real country music. Don’t get me wrong it’s a fun catchy tune, but please. She has a huge fan base to click on her tunes, so she could just about top any genre charts for that reason. Fun song though.
This song is NOT GOOD. She is NOT country.
No!!!
🤧😷🤢🤮🤮Most vulgar artist ever.....All SHE DOES IS COPYING COPYING other REAL ARTISTS....🤮🤮🤮🤮
This song is COMPLETLY GARBAGE. She needs to stay in the genre that made her who she is. Dont get me wrong she is a beautiful woman that is VERY VERY talented and has made lots of GREAT music in the PAST. But ever since she got married to Jay-Z her music bacame garbage as well as his. And if this is what she or they call a career reboot or revitalize then they BOTH ARE BADLY mistaken. The ONLY reason this garbage ass song got the credit that it has is because of what her name is and what she USED to be. And with this BS she is FAR FROM THAT.
The best thing about this song is that it makes pathetic white boys cry.
❤❤❤
Glorify gun use like the US isn't in crisis?
Typical 🗑️
Mid
I like the song, but not the "video".
Its catchy but its not for her
I think I might be a liiitle bit obsessed with this song 😂😅
She ready to fight somebody with gunza blazin!!!! I Know that's right!!
Comments Section
Song is pretty good but video is repetitive and too risqué for cmt to show due to a family show.. She didn’t need to make it that half naked and provocative. She can dance so would of been great to see that
It's ok. It's not authentic country, but neither is most of the country made in the last 23 years. I'd still listen to more of this over Toby Keith any day.
This legit Franklin the turtles theme song she took the beat from a kids show
This song is really not good. Lyrics sound cheap.
No not country!!!! Put some clothes on you’re too old to be dressing like that!
Let's go Beyonce
Now that's the best, I ever seen from Beyonce ..🍿🫢🧋 Good Old Country Girl..(he's haw!! he's haw!!🤠) let's ride them out fellas 🍿🤠..🗣 Now this is Billy Bob speaking!! Beyonce is my number one country girl..Now that Country song fit Beyonce bruh!..🍿🫢🧋
Lol! Horrible... I could have written this
Lame
This sound very pop
Loretta Lynn is turning over in her grave. Sorry folks, this is not country music. Takes more than an autistic guitar to make it country.Just to be clear, i am a huge Beyonce fan. I love a lot of her music. I even like this song. It's just NOT country.
It's ok but not something I would purchase.  I don't like the video either.  It just shows Beyonce on an endless loop of shooting her finger gun.  Ugh.
So it’s a recording of real country rip whom is getting none of the creds thts what pisses me off
Not bad, but real country songs are stories. Not much of a nice story on this one! I'm a country fan... She is a great pop singer but needs a little more to touch that "country singer" journey. She doesn't really need it; she's good!
Nope
I better not hear this on country radio
Song is fantastic but video needs more effort
Not feeling it ...enough said
This is the worst most fake country song I've ever heard, ahahaha. This is a spit in the face of country music, honestly. It's absolutely terrible, lol.
This is totally stupid lol hahah she thinks she can infiltrate Country hahaha
Everybody sayin if you don't care for it you're a racist gftoh🙄
Omg these clown will do anything to stay relevant. A true psychopath
There's no way in HELL that this is no.1. Damn tell me country music isn't rigged now. What a fucking joke
Not country music. It’s a NO for me.
This is a pop song wanting to be country.
Did AI produce this 😆 🤣 strait garbage
I'll never understand why she has to be half naked in every song she does or everytime I see her on tv. She has beautiful voice, she doesn't  need to do that.
More like a pop song, with a matching video, with a country title and banjo. The last few years country has been inching closer to pop music. And this is just one more.
What in the illuminatti is this?!?  Is this SNL?
Awful song
MY as well not wear a jacket
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
😐……………………………😂💀
Sorry baby, you missed the boat on this one. This isn't even close to country anything. Congratulations for trying
Bey you bih you have done it again bc I like it….. cmon y’all don’t be a bih come take it to the floor now ‼️‼️💋
Brilliant.
So she can’t make it anymore with her other music? Now, she is a country artist? Really? This is sleezy country music. I could not listen to hardly half of this song. This is not country music. #TobyKeith
Your kidding, right?
Eu bem country
Country singers have enough natural talent to leave their clothes on.
I thought the song was very good, but not a number 1.
🚮
Hmmmm...https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=EHxmPepTrrA9oyEl
No thanks
I am not a current country fan but grew up on Dolly, Willy, Rogers, Brooks and such, this song gives me those vibes. Classy
People don't know if they're black, white, man, woman, a rapper or a country singer. This is not country this is just no good.
Music is super hook is killer  but the rest of the lyrics are messy
What a weird video.
Wtf is with the video . On a loop ?
Put some clothes on. This is garbage 🤮 not country at all. This is just as bad as “beer and trucks” bro country.
its not country nice try th0
It’s an interesting attempt, but this is an urban take of what country music is to a city person. It’s funny though we have Country Bro music that wants to be like Beyoncé’s music.
Good Gospel tune
This is garbage she don’t have the kountry swagger
This is not kountry music
This shit sucks
Lyrics are not bad, production is good, singing is phenomenal, but country is like hip-hop. You either grew up in the country (culture) or you didn't.
I love Beyoncé. I’ve always loved her music but I think this song is horrible. I also love country music I’ve been listening to country since I was a baby and this song is not it. The music isn’t too bad but her voice just doesn’t match or go with the song at all. Also the lyrics are just awful. I feel like she just threw a bunch of country words in a song. It kinda feels like she’s making fun of country music. It just doesn’t feel authentic.
You GEAUX Beyonce.  Love it. You GEAUX girl. Want to see you do more country. ❤❤❤
Bey on that pew,pew shiz 🔫🤠
On repeat😂
This ain’t a country song she needs to keep on dreaming and she wonders why country music radio stations won’t play her song
She did the minimum and KILT NICKI MINAJ!!! I SEE YOU B
I absolutely love this! Beyoncé did it better than today’s mainstream country.
This is way better than most fat white guy country music. Nothing on my darius rucker though.
Reyna  Robert's ❤
She's such a me me me hog!  Poor thing never won record of the year, so trying to get that at the CMAs?  Sorry, lady... it's like the Grammy you didn't win.  The WHOLE album has to be good, not just a couple songs.  Definitely no Darius, but keep trying girl. 😂
I think the lyrics are general country terms/cliches, but it’s no actual country music. But I like that she’s trying
Country music has always been good. Most people hate on it because their racist against white people or they think that all country people are racist against black people. People who are genuine music lovers know good music comes from all genres. This song is pretty good, reppin Texas! The video was weird but she looks great!
This is kinda weak tbh. 😂 But and A for effort.
Please lady put some clothes on.  Not that great of a song!
Song is meh but this video sucks.
I really like it! js
You can tell she didn’t grow up into country. This doesn’t come off great at all.
Sounds like shit
she always gives it as it is. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ I love country. dammm
So cause it has a twang to it and some "country" words its automatically country? Ok you know what i don't even like country music and I don't like Beyonce im a metalhead i just wanted to see what the big deal was why everyone is making a fuss.
It sounds more like a gospel tune, without the gospel lyrics. It’s a 5 out of 10. The video is dumb and she just continues to diminish women by being part of the objectification of women, instead of being acknowledged for intelligence and talent. But, the song pulls her into a different genre which was the intent. It’s all marketing. Blah.
I didnt know she was pro gun sweet
Wtf lol 😆 can't beat em join em aye?
This isn’t a country song.  Its a parody of a country song written by someone who’s writing what they think a country song sounds like.  This reminds me of the lyrics to “Gone Country” by Alan Jackson.
Put some clothing on, this isn't going to make you relevant,  why put that image out there for young people.. you're a has been!! Put some damn clothing on!!!
It's a catchy little ditty that I still wouldn't buy; there's no variety in the video. I'm sure a lot of males love the repetitive walk from the shadows with the boobs exposed, but where's the creativity?!? Don't get me wrong...I'm not a "hater", although not a "Bey" fan, and I wish her luck with the crossover to the country genre. Strut your stuff, Bey, but give the rest of the peeps something else to view other than the almost naked you.
This is a bad pop album 😂 No wonder they won’t play it on the radio. 😂
This song is garbage!!! Nobody likes it but its #1 on country billboards. This is not country what a joke. 😂
I put the video at an epic failure except for the flashes of light coming out of her finger. Clothing was meh and I’m a huge fan.
Black background did nothing for the video. Some visual imagery would be nice  Its catchy
I admire and love @Beyonce’ and I always have and continue to do that. This is wonderful and she is only making herself a bigger contribution to the world and the people that “think” they have whatever kind of ownership of a genre of music with a huge variety of individuals. Why’s everyone having stokes because she owned a song? She has always? Regardless of genre y’all… come on !
Does she wants to be white? What is with country music, it all sounds the same, same semi naked body, and same rhythm…🫣🫣😷
Johnny cash would be so proud
❤❤❤
She should of rode in on a horse with that outfit.
meh
This song is catchy but this is NOT. COUNTRY. MUSIC.
FFS!!😑
Great tune and the video is masterful. Love it!!!
.
Yea, listen to it 6 times. ❤
WTF is this😂😂😂coming from a brother 🤦🏿‍♂️
I thought this was the video 😂
THIS NOT COUNTRY!🙄
People upset over her doing a "country" album, have you not noticed Nashville turning country music into pop music over the last thirty years?
😂😂😂
Far from being Country
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The country music genre is obviously desperate.
This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.  Country music did not need Beyoncé.
This is not country music
As a country fan this is pretty dag on good
Who knew all it took was Beyonce to bridge the gap between hip/hop and country.
Thank you Beyonce! It's a shame you had to switch up genres to make a point. Beyonce has a way better voice than Taylor any day of the week, Beyonce writes her own music, and knows how to dance. I truly hope she makes a music video to this song.
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
don’t be a 🐶 come take it to the floor now 💋
Put some damn clothes on H😅.
Boring
💥💥Damn, Sasha Fierce is a icon.. A milf too.. Although, that will never happen.. This song is fire 💥💥
Sounds like 💩
The video could've been a bit better tf 🤣😂 20 times shooting finger guns with 20 times caressing urself prob took 5 min to think up. Shes known for her choreography as well as her voice.
Could've worn some blue jeans, boots not this trashy look. Lol can't picture her in the country, too prissy and deva
Is she on drugs…are we not trying anymore?
This is not country, go check out Chapel Hart, if you wanna hear country music
This is cultural appropriation. It's very sad what she's doing to a culture that doesn't belong to her.
Let her be great, ppl boy I tell you🤦🏽‍♂️
Kulturelle Aneignung!
nope, don't like it....
She’s a Texas girl so it makes sense and doesn’t seem forced it’s her culture in many ways
She’s a Texas girl so it makes sense and doesn’t seem forced it’s her culture in many ways
video boring. so is the song.
She needs to put some clothes on!
not impressed....she can do better...
An average Popsong, nuttin' mo' !
Check out “Deal Me In”. Also a fun song!
Hmm, sounds gospel, not country.
Keep the nudity outta country or just stay out all together 😂
This isn’t country 🤢
I'm sorry but this is a no for me 😳
If she's so great, why does she always feel the need to expose herself for attention? And women wonder why men look at them like a piece of meat, or think of them as bimbos. Respect yourself and put some dang clothes on.
Who run the world ? Strippers 😮
This isn't even country and it's putting me to sleep
Cute and catchy…. But it’s not real country. Country music has a soul that Beyoncé knows nothing about… she is one of wealthiest women in the world, country music comes from struggles . She might have the beats but definitely not the soul or experience to write legit country music. The fact she came out half naked  in her first country song shows us her talent isn’t enough.  Let’s not bring all the Hollywood drama to country music please . Next thing you know Sam Smith will be on stage with her . This has nothing to do with being a woman or being black . It has to do morals and the circles she run with.
Another one she is amazing they all scared right now  because she will get their awards 😅😅
This song is garbage
This made #1? I cant see it lmao. Why are people lying to Beyonce? The song was dumb af and the video was whack.
If you also win an award for the video idea then I won't understand the world anymore.
I'm not a fan of Beyonce, never was. I don't listen to radio country (bluegrass is where it's at).. and this is catchy affffff lol. And Rihannon Giddens on banjo? OK!
This isn't country. It's catchy but definitely not country.
All the fragile country fans talking about “this trash ain’t country” when it sounds more country than half of the country hits this past decade. Y’all need to grow up. You don’t have to like the song. But grow up. It’s pathetic 😂.
Didnt expect that..... Wow... I actually like it!!!!❤❤
Wtf is going on? Why is it the same thing over and over
I like the song, but there is no point to the video
COUNTRY chart? ….come on now. This is NOT country. Ridiculous. Not denying that Beyoncé is talented, but this ain’t it.
Why she always so naked!!!
Idk who was in charge of this video...... BUT THEY NEED TO BE FIRED!
This video makes no sense
Love the tune but video is a bit repetitive
Beautiful job beyonce
Not a fan of the song.  Enjoy her music, just not this song
My problem is hearing the song and watching the video and  knowing it's Beyonce' singing Country music.  My mind can't handle it all at once. I'm gonna have to wrap my mind around it all and listen again.
A pair of sizeable hits for Beyoncé.
This song ❤
This sounds like A.I. averaged every existing country song into a new genre "Basic-ass country."
Doesn't sound any better than any of the other country songs out...but to each his own.
This song SUCKS and its far from country 😂😂😂😂  freaking terrible .
I heard this yesterday and was like okay now we doing something different 🔥🔥🔥🔥
no... enough said
a pop song made with a blues progression is NOT country. This is as good as the rest of the trash country out now, though so good for her
This is terrible.
WHY DOES SHE KEEP DOING THE SAME THING ON THE VIDEO..NOT VERY CREATIVE EXCEPT THE GUYS WILL LIKE HER CHEST..
why its hate or somebody's mad cause they don't like the song?. some of you and your fandom is weird af.. I like the other song better and i will support this sister making a country album because we as a people are talented enough to be number in any genre of music.. But going at people over their opinion is crazyy
Nope! Not a country voice or country girl. Just trying to up one on Taylor. Nope! Not a country singer.  And WHY WHY WHY, with all the violence in america is there a need for a pretend gun!
Cultural appropriation?
She need to listen to more country music.
This is crap what a video ......
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This is some ass
Sounds like the cuss words she uses in the song! Bringing thug to country😂
What a stupid music video it's the same thing over and over again... This is not country...
its not good..and actually sounds like a joke..weird all would be proud
So she has to come out practically nude to sell her lack of talent? 😂😂😂Typical and you sheep eat it up.
That is not country music, not even close'...
This is not country.
It's not a bad song, but it's not country music.  This is a pop song.
This is not country music. So it makes sense why all of you are saying “ I am not normally a country fan” and also makes sense that country fans hate this song. I think it is trash of a song. All of you hits 1 sheep like and purchased this song to get her number 1. There is nothing about her voice that is country. This song is laughable at best.
Official visualizer? That's a stupid thing to call it. Good song. Modern pop country.
complete TRASH. T R A S H.  Record company trying to push Beyonce into a new genre.... the unnecessary language and forced rhythm.... the pushing of a banjo in background to make it more "Country".  Come on...
She should have just make a studio video. Bey doesn't need to be naked the song is fire. Her husband does not wish her well
So was ok vid sucked.  Thumbs down
Hilarious, and seriously folks she doesnt have a good voice and lame lyrics.  Clearly competing with Taylor Swift.
She’s got a great voice. I don’t understand why she’s always dressing revealing her breast’s or more. That’s not fashion. Leaves no room for the imagination nor can one look at her as a lady.
A new country music legend in the making.
This is odd both the song & the video.
thi is not goig to go weel
🥰🫶🙏💫
Not that i care if shes from texas or not, or if shes going country. I personally dont care for the song. It kinda boring. Didnt matter if it was beyonce or whoever. The song wasnt for me
Thats a Real Country song,, and it sounds good
Keep making the music
Beyonce: You’re move Taylor
Is this a joke 😂😂😂
See what a little crying from her hubby does about sexism and race she now has a #1 on country ….what a joke 👎, cry racism and reap the rewards
Give me PANTERA PLEASE!!!!!!
I like her hair.  I didn't know she had straight hair.  Blonde too...Natural Roots bAAby!!!
🔥🔥🔥
She was real creative in the video.. let’s stand there and do the same thing 🙄 how awful
Well I was excited when I saw the pic of Fox announcing her new number 1 hit .. I thought dang that girl looks good in a cowboy hat with a dress that covers ..how pretty , I thought . Well !!! This is not a surprise , bring the sexual dirty talk to country music . This is disgusting and so inappropriate for country music . They just have to ruin everything.  Take your punk ass stuff back to pop.  And put some clothes on . Ugh ! 😮😮
Terrible 😂 this is not country music this is someone who is getting bored and decided their country 😂
CI_INTRY at it's finest.
Unexpected..dig the switch up stepping into a  new genre.   But this video vs is def a dumb 1
I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.   I now live in Port Arthur, Texas via Houston so don't come for me...hot mess.
I would argue that this song isnt country but to me the classification and genre if a song is less important than if a song is good or not. This song is absolute dog water.
This is pretty lame
No felling to this song, why is she undressed, PATHETIC ATEMP AT COUNTRY. You really missed the mark on this one. NOT A FAN!!!
Dumb and dumber
This is not country music just like the other people making stuff like this shit it's not Country Western Music they need to call it Something else. Its not in the same class as real country music
What, nobody like your kinda music anymore.
Tornados, backroads, whiskey, redemption.   Yep. Ticks all the boxes for a country song 😂
Hot mess😮
Disgrace to country music.
Honestly sounds strange and like she’s had several drinks. lol
Country is cool again 😎 👌
Hate to burst the bubble, this is not country music. This is pop with a prop cowboy hat.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It seems like the reason it's at the top of the list is because she's leaving nothing to the imagination.  😅😅
I like this song. Toe tapping.
This is not country music.
<Darius Rucker has left the chat>
Now I need a collab with her and Miranda Lambert 🔥🔥🔥😍😍
Great 🎵 terrible outfit someone forgot to wear a shirt under that vest.
This song sucks 😂
Finally country music that moves the soul and body, and not just the body!!
This isn’t country lol 😆
This music video is stuck on repeat….song is trash
This woman has no clue what country music is even about. Nope  but she sure can get as close to naked as possible and cuss alot ! Not country music. But country music hasn't been country music for along time.
So if this is country does that make michael jackson the king of country?
Pop Country.
Hold up why the hell is she naked when have you ever seen a naked Country singer 🤦🏾‍♀🤦🏾‍♀🤦🏾‍♀
This isn't considered a country song at all.
This is terrible. Just because you put an accoustic guitar in your song, does not make it an instant country song!
Take the risk. Got it. Thanks Beyonce
More gospel sounding than country.
Me: 😀           🤠
In the words of Simon Cowell "that was absolutely HORRIBLE!"
Awe nice. No thanks
This was fantastic on mute.
The video is as equally lame as the song.
This is not country
certainly has some country elements, but I don't percieve this as country
Beyonce cant sing that well.... She deserves country as much as all the others that cant sing well. Such as Blake Shelton. Luke Bryant. etc etc.
Nice wig
can this video be any stupider
This is so weird. Looks like female terminator. Never saw anyone dressed like this at the Grand Ole Opry.
sorry you'll never be country
I love this country song !
People supporting her because shes beyonce not because of the song the song is actually trash she trying to clean up the satanist and witch talk
Trash
Idgaf she still got it 😩
This isn't honky tonk Boots Scoot n Boogie country. This is more bluesy, bluegrass.
Wow very impressive !!!!! ❤
Anyone who says they're now a fan of country....... have never listened to real country at all in your life
The banjo is the only thing " country " and her country references . I don't blame country stations for not wanting to play this " this ain't country no hoedown at all "
In love 😩🥹😍
Couldn't they do something more for the video tho?
This surprisingly isn't bad. The main issue I have with it is the programmed drums. If you're going to do country, at least get a proper drummer to play on it.
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY
To say this was terrible would be an understatement… WTF did I just watch…
#1 country song my ass.
Golly Parton 🤠
Waylons turning in his grave. shit aint country. there's black girls that know country this aint one of em. this is sick is what it is.
This most be the most simple song in the world. I wrote a report showing Beyoncé's fans are the least educated in the world, I understand why.
Catchy little tune but her just walking around shooting her finger guns? Boring.
Beyoncé is a legend
Beyonce is more real country than pop/rock/rap being passed on as country today. Country music has turned away from real country and Beyonce is more real country than today's country artists.
Me: I don’t like country music 😐 Beyonce: *drops country music* Me: 😐🙂😀😃🤠
This is awful
Trash
Call me a hater but this isn’t country. Darius Rucker and Charlie Pride is country. With that said Beyoncé is a very talented entertainer. Beautiful one at that. Ok give me thumbs down now.
Just Awful.
Love it!!
This is a pathetic attempt!  Stay in your own lane!  Video is tasteless!
Country music traded Tylor Schwift for Beyonce and did OK
My style has always been a blend of country and hip hop. I am happy to see it slowly becoming a popular thing. The music world is a better place for it
Now country will be corrupted with bitch/ho lyrics.. Great 🙄
This is not country!! Definitely doesn't represent no Texas hold'em either. Y'all funny for believing this bs.
Yes B,  You Can Do ANYTHING!!!
RHIANNON GIDDENS made  Beyonce sound good.
Why is this considered country....?
Songs  not bad, but why does she have to dress like a whole in the video.
How can any1 be falling for this. This aint country music. And all the sudden this chick loves country music? Cmon country fans. Dont let people like this infect the genre.
Oh Please...this is a mockery of Country Music.What a joke
This is horrible
CuLTUraL APProPrIATion!!!
Trash
I like Franklin the turtle's theme song better. Maybe I should redo the Looney Tunes song on a banjo & film myself blowing country cliches out my nose & film me running around butt naked & it will be a number one country song & video
NOPE NOPE AND HELL NO
Its a good tune but if yall think this is Country music yall must be gettin high on lawn clippins.  Effin Idiots!
She needs to stay in the "rap" business cause country ain't for her 😂😂
She sure is white.
If you like this check out One the Duo .
The only reason this song has any momentum is because of the name attached with it....this is junk.
This is a disrespect to put this in country genre. Song is horrible
So who wrote this song for her?
Her voice lacks passion, rather boring
This song is garbage, it sounds like she just threw something together. This sounds nothing like country music, she should have collaborated with country artist. Oh well, Beyonce fans are as just as blind and biased as MAGAs.
Nope. Ya can't talk crap of other artists dipping into country then jumping in the ring to become relevant. Bye girl with the creepy country.
Dumb
This video and song are useless.
Country has gone down hill big time. The weirdos have taken it over too. I'm going to keep listening to Hank Williams Junior, real country music, not this trash.  She is part of the illuminati, so you know she's evil, she's evil in disguise. But, people are blind to it.
Not country... I haven't heard this anywhere but here, but it's #1???? Someone must be playing with the numbers because she's who she is.
If this is Country then Machine Gun Kelly is the best Rock artist ever 😂 yall some delusional mfs calling this Country Music lmao
No ma'am 😂😂😂😂
Suddenly a country singer? Awesome talent but not "country." Fake to make money.
Trashy look, good song
This isn't country music I like Beyonce music but this isn't country at all
DAVIDSNOW sunglases 😎💯💥💥💥💥💥💥
Beyoncé is a loser & a bully
David
Molto brava e bella 🙂
Still dress like a hip hop genre sl***t.
peweee! that reeks! 💩
awful styling
Why is a black making country music. This is trash
This is pure trash. Nice voice butnthis ain't country music.
Don’t be fooled.  The only reason she is doing this is because country is booming on the streaming charts right now.  Her and her Illuminati handlers are just jumping on the cash train.  This song isn’t even good.
I’m a fan just because she’s a Virgo like me lol but give this woman her Grammy stop playing with her she change the game she gave other black country singers a bigger stage
Where Taylor is running away from country, Queen B sprinting towards country music.
I'm predicting a time ..when all the clubs and car are gone .. and we go back to this around a fire with friends and family... cherish what u have now while you can..
Was always a country fan music.. until this one 🤦🏽‍♀️
This Ain't COUNTRY Put some clothes on
I guess im the only one that dont like it!
My favorite Beyonce song ever❤
im sorry... that made no. 1?  why?! dont get me wrong it was... decent. but if just because "she is who she is makes her have no. 1." i've completely lost hope in the music industry.   but what does it matter, just another low life complaining about someone else who has 10 lifetimes worth of money. "the poor stay poor so the rich can do what ever tf they want."
I don't like it. Its catchy but feels fake. Like they're trying too hard. Also i really only like 90s country and this ain't that
Put yer tirlts away lassie
I like the new song😅
Song alright, no baadd, nice middle of the road.... but the the video... er, coulda been a bit better, it's pretty... i dunno... random really. Overly sexual for the song and pretty repetitive. Meh
So she just walks, stands still, takes her left hand and seductively raises it past her enormous implants. Then tilts that left  hand to her left, flicks it twice, with flashes, then blows the smoke away - simulating gun shots.   Over and over.   What is she trying to do?  What’s the meaning of the flick flash?     Come on Lady B, you’re better than this.
Well the songs ok but the rest not so much
Country never looked so sexy!❤
further proof that beyonce could take a shit and people would clap
ABSOLUTE TRASH 🗑
A great line dance song
She must spend a lot of time watching Franklin the Turtle to copy the cartoon theme song.
Enjoyable tune
Love it Bey ❤
AND THESE TROLLS THINK ITS GOOD SONG.I BET BEYOUNCE TOLD THESE TROLS JUMP OFF BRIDGE THEY WOULD DO. OMG THIS SONG MIGHT BE WORST IVE EVER HEARD
THIS SONG IS TERRIBLE. U PEOPLE KEEP BUYING THIS CRAP
No need for that costume
In my opinion this is not country music...this is a pop song with country flourishes and somewhat country lyrics...just my opinion.
She look white
This is not country music and why is she half naked!!!!
Nope don't like it at all
That shit 100% completely sukked!
Loving the song but the video is just her in an outfit barely holding her tatas in.....over and over again. She could dance a little bit couldn't she instead of the same thing over and over
Garbage, this shit aint considered country
Gimme a break - industry driven marketing - who cares
I heard this for the first time yesterday and was blown the fuck away. I had to look it up to see who it was and I couldn’t believe it! Bey has given country music the shot in the arm it sorely needed. I’m an immediate fan🎼
This woman is classless and disgusting
😂😂😂
This isn’t a country song
This is terrible. She must be testing the dedication of the Beyhive.
She is so fyne?
This is about country as the other shit on the radio Cool beat to bring back line dancin however
Beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤  Country music forever ❤
I cant stop listening and become addicted. Love you Beyonce
Is this actually the official video? Love, love the song, but this is the most boring video ever. I was waiting for it to start and it never did….
It’s not really country. Feels like satire
I already hate this song. This is why I listen to outlaw country
Good song, video sucks. Could be better at least dress like a cowgirl and better back ground.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤠nope.
Calling out Taylor Swift
just wanted to listen to her music not wank to the visualizer
I am a taylor swift fan. But this song is amazing!
Yall.....the thumbnail. Weird ass occult bullshit
I can't stand country, Nashville or Texas, but this Beyonce drop is 🔥
LMAOL
The song is okay. No impact on me.
Very interesting and different!!
🍓🍓🍓🍓
More clothes that you have a hard time doing things well We don't want to see naked people, come on , sorry , good job
This is not country music.Get real.
I don't mind watching her in pantyhose since she's hot as hell, but whoever came up with this video needs to lose their job. Wow.😴
Have a look at all the Masonic satanic witchcraft going on in this clip.
If I heard this in a bar by some nobody I would think ok it’s not super annoying but I certainly don’t think it’s a hit by any means.
So, are we just gonna watch this low cut, trashy outfit on repeat? Mediocre song,... Wasn't impressed this isn't country.
Would have done better with a much better outfit. The low cut is way too much!
I am not a big Country Fan but I really like that song.
🖤🙏🏻🖤
I like her new twist genre! I can see doing a new line dance to this song💞💃
Is this what she thinks country is half naked countries one of the most respectful looks there are ...I don't like it
You can try to dress it up in boots and spurs but that's still a pop voice trying to sing country 😂
with good clothes is much better
This proves there is nothing Beyonc'e can't do. RID'EM  COWGIRL !
Illimunati strong😂
Not sure what all the hype is about. Pretty mediocre song with a lackluster video. Kinda pointless , actually. Big yawn.
Sounds very beautiful
This some sh*t😢
I'm not a Beyonce fan but this song? I love it ❤
Love the song, videoclip not so much🎉
Put some clothes on.
🙄
On the surface it's a simple, repetitive video that has the cuts at exactly the right frame.... and she's completely effing with the audience. Can't stop watching it. Brilliant.
The only reason she is doing country is trying to match Taylor Swift. I like Beyonce but this is horrible. The only people buying it or streaming it are probably Beyonce fans not country fans. It sounds nothing like country. She also tried to copy Taylor Swift by teasing the announcement of this record. This is embarrassing for her.
All Hail the Queen 👸🏾  we have to give Respect where it's due
Unpopular opinion...this is trash. The rhyme of the lyrics are that of a primary school kid. Texas/Lexus, down/round, too/you. The production is awful. Beyonce stans will kill me but this is so beneath what she's always delivered. My ears hope they don't get offended again.
It’s almost be like Willie Nelson trying to do rap music, but worse is on every level…
🤔 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Just Sad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this... this ain't country music.  maybe pop folk?  but not country.
where dat cowboy hat tho
Yall only like her cuz she half naked and keep using this fake finger gun 😂😂😂😂
Sounds like every other Beyoncé song since 2007 with a country beat
The prosthesis breasts looking “round, round, round…” 😅
Love Bey....but don't love this song.
Is it a good country song? It's too pop for my liking.
This shit is trash 😂
Ummmm están mejor las coreografías, q suben a las redes
The song is pointless and too repetitive with "bitch." The only thing "country" about this song is the great music. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING, but not surprising that she thinks she can "rule" all genres. i would be offended if i was a real country singer.
Not only is she turning into a white lady, but she's making white lady music now🤣
Not enough grit for a country song
They really stretched this video...lol
The song we now know we didn't need.
Hey its franklin coming over to play
Blazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love Texas hold em and so do a lot of other white dudes. Smart woman for songs title
I love the song, but I hate the video.
No I'm good.
Racists trying to claim  CM to be theirs... look out we coming for death metal too.. or maybe not 😃😃😃
Please dress appreciate
Stupid
White Appropriation 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The song is good but this is an awful video? Borg goes country? Movements on repeat?
If Beyonce sang “My Old Man’s a Dustman” she would get a million or more likes. The song is okay, but this is a lazy video, along with the one for 16 Carriages.
Dress up😫
Trash
Not a fan 🤷🏻‍♂️
when red neck come out ,
Not all that impressed . Not a song I would want to listen to several times . I give it a 4 out of 10   She has a long way to go to be considered country
Wow! This sucks!
This is total crap this is not country music at all..!
The video sucks.  Her blowing her fingers on the loop.  So tired of this white woman
so what , 10
What makes it country the yeah!  Or the wooh! ? Asking for a friend
What makes it country the yeah!  Or the wooh! ? Asking for a friend
Well we black ppl , Africans-started/brought this music here .the banjo n other string instruments . The banjo is feom africa. Haha n they hate tht shes in country cuz she gon take it over n Thts ok i guess she bored a f
Tanner Adell is country music!! 🏆✨🙌
Its  NOT country music. They dont call people bitches in country songs
I love the old country banjo part towards the last of verses, now that is old country, listen to dolly parton. This is country! Cant waite till line dances start up!!
At this point in her career she can just record the sound of her farts and people will call it art. Is she a great artist - yes, or even more so she's a brand. But this is mediocre at best. In the end, she's great at surrounding herself with the correct people and recycling different genres, but she's in no way revolutionary.
Yeah, no thank you
What makes it country the yeah!  Or the wooh! ? Asking for a friend
Trash!  She  is no Loretta Lynn.
Nudity and cursing is not of the Country Genre.
Gross. Thumbs down to this.
🦉Beyoncé 🥺🫣🖤🖤🤌🏽
I love this new country song from Queen Bey❤
elvis in the church on sunday
That getto not Texas
Cowbey
I like the lyrics somewhat, it’s to gimmicky. Our ancestors fought to sing, we still are, a lot of genres come from us. I feel you gotta come with it. It’s okay. It’s Beyoncé everyone loves her.
Video sucks.  Ditch JayZ before you end up like Whitney.
Nice song,  would it kill her to put some clothes on?
I actually like this better than her regular stuff.  😆
F Taylor B is the queen
Horrible. Garbage. Stay in your lane.
🤦‍♂️
sucking 📍
Lost in this sea of comments, but what's wrong with this that this has become a political bullshit mess. Great song.
Ain’t even country
WTF is that?  I'm not sure you'd hear that on any country music radio station.
😂😂😂 NOW she open the door to listen too more country artists 🤷🏽🤷🏽
Unfortunately, artist sometimes step into other genres and stink it up. Texas Holdem’ is so 2005
I like it 🎉
Too nasty for a good old country video. And foul language so not a true country song. But don’t worry, she didn’t write it
This song sucks
❤ Loves it!
What a dumb video too.
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=FGsUe7AOo-G_KkRG  Omg 😂😂😂😂 she stole it from Hey it’s Franklin. Come on B
what is this  where is the country in this and why the monotonous video??
It’s like people forget Bey is from Houston. And her first attempt at country may take some getting used to, but it’s not unlistenable.
😂😂
I wish Shania wore that costume
This was a better put togather song. but it "could never be number 1..they just gave that to her because of who she is..I wouldn't by this song if it was the last country song on earth..it was a tad depressing.
Great song! Very catchy.  🙂
I love my Lexus 😅 I felt that
Yo what made you do this my neega???
Now, if she'll only do some Creole Zydeco........
It's a bad parody of someone's twisted idea of  what comedy music should sound like. 😂😂😂
All I can say is she tried..nobody is bying that stuff that this is a number 1, its horrible 😂 🤣
Nope don't like it sounds like shit.
Lololol this absolutely horrendous
FIRST let me say I do like Beyonce & most of her music, BUT this song, video, & outfit should NOT be classified as a country song must less a #1 hit!!! Honestly it is an insult to Country Music!!!! Girl I like most of your music & you are a beautiful woman, but "country music" is NOT your music, or at least not this song, video, or outfit!
I’ll call this Hick Hop
This sounds depressing..and she gets a number 1 for this 🤣🤣 this sounds like grandma depressing. I don't like it..and again she has to come out looking half naked u go girl 🙄
A REAL country woman doesn't dress trashy like that! Nothing country about this. The beat might be country but that's it. Your "look" has buckle bunny written all over it.
What was that?
Going to bring the hip hop word "bitch" into country music? Not for me, you're not.😉👎
like taylor switf naked and guy  hahhhh but much better
WHAT AN AWESOME SONG 🎵  ❤ 🎉 🙏 🌞
Damn culture vultures  (Spits dip) In all seriousness thats the best song she did since all the pretty ladies.
you've got to be kidding me, half naked. no place for this in country music. stay in your R&B. better for everyone.
People are talking about your music country , this is funny
I love seeing the rednecks get triggered by her.
More songs like this b and this like daddy little girl ❤😊
Me dio ansiedad este video
Why does she have to be half naked singing a country song?
What's with black people and nudity?
LAZIEST MUSIC VIDEO EVER!  Just wow. Tell me you’re arrogant enough to not even try anymore without actually telling me.   Terrible song too 😂
Dam that was awful and trashy! Screams mid life crisis!
Sounds more like she's making fun of country music 🤷
Ugh she always disrespectful to herself and gonna make country music trashy
Gyat
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC! It just sounds like she is making a big joke out of the genre! Sounds like crap!
Still fine af
Great song!
What the actual #@#@ is this. I sure hope country radio don't play this. What would Jones and Haggard say. 😮
💯👍🤠Go Bey!🎼🔥
🎉🎉 Another BEYONCE Masterpiece in Song! 🎶 🎶
As I country fan: I mean I don't hate it, but the lyrics aren't "country". Beyonce would have a bonafide country hit if she had a proper songwriter, or if she collabed on a duet.
This is garbage plain garbage sorry but in country music we don't dress like a street walker and country music doesn't sound anything like this  it trash
This is not country music. It is garbage! Shame on any country music station that includes it in their playlist. By attempting to appease people who could care less about country music, they have effectively delivered a slap in the face to the generations of fans of the genre. All done to pacify an outcry by a small minority of individuals whose only aim is to cause dissent and thrust their lack of morality and decency upon others. Ridiculous!
In the year 3024, archaeologists Will dig up this banger and wonder what kind of ritualistic dance we performed to summon rain.☔️💃🕺
Heeeyyy it's Franklin.
Open two tabs...put this on one and 'Hey its Franklin' theme song on the other....hit play....Weak Beyonce girl, weak...but then again, Obama got his slogan from Bob the Builder...'Can we build it? Yes we can!'  🤣😜
Wtf - Texas
Hey it’s Franklin 🐢🔥
This is a possibly good song ruined by this ridiculous soft porn video that has nothing to do with country and wholesome morals.  Nope boo
This is country music for people who don’t like country music.
Come on now, that's that TEXAS Sugar Honey Ice Tea. Ya'll just witness a cross over in country music. All the black cowboys & cowgirls going turn up to this one. Hide and watch. lol get it girl. We Texans gotta stick together. I love this one. It's different but the competitionis is about to begin.
This isn't country at all. Let's get Reba, Dolly that's country.
tf was that?? 🤔
she is fine
I really liked this song, but felt the video was creepy and unnecessary.  I wish she didn’t get so sexualized.
That outfit....
Who said shes the first black woman comes first in country music? Shes not black. U can’t even see any black on her.
Looks like some folks are upset that she topped the country charts with this song
This is garbage.
Call me old fashion  but what in hell is what she wearing  got any thing to do with country music  Having your breast out like that is not the way to sell country and I mean true country music  You can led a horse to water but you can not make it drink You can call yourself country but you have missed the mark in all sorts of ways  This is me not being mean but real.
Honestly don’t like this. Doesn’t sound anything like country to me. To be honest
This is trash for it to even be called country music Beyoncé needs to stick with what she really knows cause this isn’t it straight garbage
:(
This song is 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Country hook....Bey Knowles her stuff....Texas be in her blood.
This is not country at all.
Awful. But she's lookin' smashable.
This is not country.
She’s overrated 🙄
I’m disgusted that this is considered country
This is not a country song
Well it's official! There is nothing Bey can't do - and crush it!
Wow this some garbage. Wow ohh Lord please help my heats
Country?
Something Black Folks can Texas Two Step too 😊
❤
My favorite 😍
#1 on the county charts! Yeehaw! 🤠
I don't see what all the hype is about.  Seems a little pretentious to me.  Reminds me of the Soap Opera star some years ago with that Giddy On Up song.  They both seem to be trying too hard.
Hoedown!😂 #imnaked! #lookatmygirls! 😂
Yucky
❤❤❤J'adore bonne musique le rythme tout la voie puissante qu'elle à 🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is not country. This is Beyonce trying to sing country only.
Awful. Hard pass.
SellOut
Umm what did i just watch and listen to exactly
Oh hell no. Is this what constitutes for art now? Put some clothes on.
All of you who like this song and Beyoncé -gone country, you need your heads examined because this is crap!
This is some Quinton Tarantino shit
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well, she is from Texas. Ya know she got it in her, it’s Texas
This is not giving
Beyonce fans trying to act like this is good😂
This woman literally said “there’s a tornado in my tiddy” 😭😂
I like her other music better.   She is a talented singer but I don’t like this
Its actually a good song.....
porno
Demonism coming to country if yall want to. Not for me. JESUS IS KING I live in Nashville, so I pray against this demon worshiper all day long every day!
I give her credit for trying something different. This wasn't too bad.
😍😍😍😍💃💃💃🔥🔥🔥🔥🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶I love you🫶🫶🫶
One eye illuminati symbolism
This is too revealing. I'm tired of seeing half naked women. Just let your voice shine. That's all. 😮‍💨
This is R&B with a country twang. That's all.
Beyonce is beautiful not sure why she has to sexualize herself.
This ain’t country this is pop
Its a fun song but it aint country.. but then again country aint country anymore.
The video is worth watching but the song sounds like a what non country musician thinks a country song is.
I love a bunch of black country artist men and women but just cause u have lyrics about Texas don't make it country
Outfit and lack of clothing is tacky. Song is okay
..the death of country music
this sounds like AI made a country song in Beyonce's voice/style.
Just because you got banjos in it don’t make it country and put a shirt on ik you can afford it oml
The song's not bad, but the choreography in the video is missing something.
This is SO stupid!! That's supposed to be a music video? It was 10 secs. of the same thing, on a loop. What a joke.
Sucks
Omg she is smokin hot
Incrivel em tudo que se propõe, a galinha dos ovos de ourov
Is there anything Bey can’t do??
stay in your lane
Very dumb 🤦‍♂️
Best country song I’ve heard in years 🎉🎉🎉
I love almost every genre of music but I just don't get what she is trying to convey with this song. The video doesn't really help. If anyone can explain it, I'm all ears! No disrespect but this song is just "meh" to me. Please change my mind.
Great music .. love her voice .. but the outfit? Not impressed with the nakedness .. the simple nostalgia of country would have been more impressive in my old lady country classic opinion
Love Queen B, but that is not country, and I’m loving it.
Uses the aesthetic of modern country pop but definitely isn't country
We'll done Beyonce
Some of it sounds country the other parts sound like trying to make pop or R&B sound country
Beyoncé becomes first Black woman artist with a No. 1 country song with "Texas Hold'Em"
Why doesn't she make an actual video
It ain’t country until I see her on a horse with a US flag, a lever action rifle over her shoulder, and a bottle of jack daniels (no chaser)
Nice song I just wish she would have some clothes on but I guess that how country is going vulgar and shameless.
I don't know Beyonce's music that well (though I've always liked what little I've heard). And I seldom listen to modern country music (I'm more about the '60s and '70s era of CM and even earlier).   All that said, this is a winning combo in 2024. Liked this song on the first listen, loved it by the third. What a great voice. What a catchy song. What a fabulous mixing of genres. It's original and very throwback and very modern all at once.   Between this and the Tracy Chapman / Luke Combs "Fast Car" duet, I'm getting more jazzed about current music than I have been in a long time. These musicians are delivering what we have needed!
Still hate country music
Too many of ya'll don't even know what a visualizer is but are hating/critiquing this video for repeating and being on loop as if it's a music video 💀 I can't 😂 Please find a brain and use it
This ain’t country, this a strip show no one asked for
"Beyoncé’s ‘Texas Hold ‘Em’ Debuts at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs Chart". Way to go Bey!
I'm sorry not sorry and you could agree to disagree but this is not county music. This video doesn't even look country. As someone that loves actual country music I won't be listening to this and I'll be surprised if the actual country station plays it. Love Beyonce but she is not country
Shits garbage
Seriously? Did she forget to put on clothes? Oh, my bad. She just likes exposing herself.
love the song but this video is whack!
Queen👏💜
Nice, the one hand up one hand down baphomet pose and the one eye mask, lovely
"I'm now a country fan"  But then you search for country music that sounds like this and realize that this song was never country. Facts, is all. Don't go crying on me.
Loved Beyonce in Destiny’s child and Dangerous in Love was fire 🔥 and a few songs in her Albums after, but I’m not feeling this song or the video
The mix seems really flat and quiet. Can't tell if that's a YT thing or if the song is just kinda flat on its own. Anyone else know?
What on freaking earth is this 😢 and the video is even worse! Put some clothes on women,have a little dignity this isn’t what the Country Genre is about....at all!!!!
Get them t****** out!
This song sucks. I hope she understands it's success is her name brand and her boobs she's flashing all over. This isn't a good song and is so unforgettable Ill never listen to it again. Please don't misunderstand - I think she's a good artist - Im not a hater - I just think this song sucks
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?si=8c7nbVXzpJfQP-lU
If it makes you feel any better queen bee, bradley cooper prob wont win a well deserved oscar this year or ever.  Adversity builds character, im sorry you couldnt hold strong any longer.  La does that to many
Lame video, the only reason anyone would like it is because she has half her clothes off, and it repeats over and over again   The song is awful. I lost interest real quickly, like the video it was the same thing over and over again for way too long. They’re really is very little talent out there, and this is certainly an example of that, just awful, in so many ways.
Beyonce is a beautiful woman, she doesn't need to reveal so much skin, it classless.
Ummm, no thanks.  Next.
Oh so when whites rap y'all call it cultural appropriation but expect whites to be silent about this garbage 🗑️? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Taylor Swift Lite
😂 idk I get it super trooper vibes from this.
I think she should have used an Alabama song due to "black history month"& we have more history than a lot of states I'm a country fan the songs lit❤️‍🔥but honestly it's more r& b- county type song but 😅🤔 it hits ❤🎯
They about to get real upset when they find out where the banjo came from…. 😉
Good Song I wish Adele did it.
The song is ok but not anything I want to hear again. And this video certainly disgusting so im done watching .
The last part eargasm
I won't be buying  this , sounds corny,  r n b  is  her forte.   Kane brown colaboration
This woman can NOT sing!!  Go away beyonce! You suck!
The only country music I'll ever like
BEYONCE IS FROM Texas
Pure Country. Love it!
How is this Country?
This is not even close to a country song. Not even kinda. Nothing means anything anymore you can just say whatever.
Came here for the imagery stayed for the song. Actually pretty damn good
Nope...try again
Horrible
This is when you try to sing country and fail… BIGLY
This is the video????? Ridiculous and not appropriate. Don't like it at all.
That shit is cuntry, not country.
She's back!!!!❤
What's with the repetitive video? So boring! Song is repetitive too. Ok, not a masterpiece.  Not impressed. Props for trying but no winner here.
What the hell is this dog shit?
Yep 🔥
Quit stealing our culture, also the Irish we’re enslaved before black people and keep in mind black people sold black people Ohhh ohhh also !!!! There’s more black people enslaved in Africa now than ever in the USA history!!! Crazy eh ?!?? Now I wanna hear your radical culture arguments !
Yee hah.
Nothing stopping you Queen B. ❤
The video is just not doing anything for me?  Song is ify as well.
Way to whore up the “country” music.
Here I am 9 days late
No thank u
Disgusting
put some clothes on and sit down
This is fucking trash 😂😂😂
What a 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤢🤢🤢💩🤮💩💩🤮💩💩🤮💩🤮🤮
Raggedy ass cliche music
WTF this is not country. Shit is whack.
Fkn trash. Smh
TEXAS HOLD ‘EM
Hey it's Franklin
Hispanics did the cowboy thing, Shakira was 1st.. I don't like her outfit..weird
Bought a cowgirl hat should be delivered by Friday. 🤠💃It's a real life boogie, now, take it to the floor. 🎶
Damn! thats the worst country music ever!!!!
Stole avicii beat
This just shows that bey is not a one-trick pony. She is so diverse in her music and am so proud of her❤
Country ghetto
This song belongs on sesame street with ushers version of abc.
Song is good the video I don't get it
oooh im loving the country beyonce
Its a hit! 😊
Newest popular song in gentleman's clubs.
It's like blue grass, met church choir, met country, met rhythm & blues. Very nice.❤
Love the song, not a fan of the video. It's the same thing over and over. Eh.
Hey its franklin, coming over to plaaay
No
The Amazon river runs for thousands of miles.  At some points it runs through areas of the rainforest that are almost untouched and have been barely explored.   Because of the porous limestone in these areas, the river water leaks through the stone and travels deep into the earth, and forms underground pools almost a mile below the surface.  Over thousands of years, small blind transparent fish have lived and evolved in these pools.  These fish have never seen the sun or surface and have never been seen by the human eye....These fish care more about this song than I do.
I hope she would of dance or something . Song good video 🤔🤔
Reminds me of Sara Evans
No
😂😂😂
https://youtube.com/@JoeH40?si=vUiiMF_fOjlyHx6h
Not good 😅
Ugh it’s horrible . My ears🤮
She's trying to get the illuminate in country music don't let her pissed slam tf off
It ain't the song that pushed her to #1
Put some cloths on and quit using your "tiits" to sale County Music...
Sounds more like Bluegrass...but I like it.
The video is so repetitive...
This song sucks and so do she.  Stupid song, video and the person singing it.  Yep I said.  I'm weak at this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The music is catchy but I really don't want to see this continuous loop of B trying to look sexy. It got old after the second time around. How about some real country dancing?
This song sucks  the video is sorry
This is good and ass and the same time 🤣
Ofcourse coz she,s almost naked..I never saw a country music singer wearing nothing while singing .. She can look much decent , not bad idea, she,s beautiful,  doesn't need this seduction.
Now we all became country fans because it's Beyonce the video and everything was trashed but you know it is what it is y'all lame and so is she
Ridiculous
Can someone fill me in on the WHY to this...why did we need this? What's up with Beyonce?
It just get worse and worse!! I guess they're running out of ideas!!! Music was at its FINEST but it's definitely headed toward its WORST!!
This isn't country
sheer unadulterated garbage. Im sure she will win a grammy anyway.
Not feeling this at all lol. Clothes please
This song whack. Sorry not sorry.
Where is the country inspiration in this song? This ain’t no Hank Williams.
Overrated.
Not a fan at all. There are better country songs out there.
The song is catchy, but lyrically, it's just so pedestrian.  It's boring. And it says literally nothing.
😃👍👍👏👏 I LIKE IT 🤠
Beyonce Makes History as the 1st Black Woman to Top Country Chart With Song 'Texas Hold 'Em' Beyoncé continues to be a trailblazer as she became the first Black woman to have a No. 1 hit country song.
This is great!  I hope she puts out more like this.
Meh🤷‍♀️
A married woman with 3 children still trying to sell sex? Pathetic , go sit down and raise your kids.
I quite like the song, but what's with the video? C'mon Bey, you coulda given us  way more than strut, pose, shoot on repeat😁.
shame there's not a decent video to match
Damn this is so cringe
Huh
Feels like R an B not so much country  ??
NOOOO 😢😢😢😢
No thanks i'll stick to Dolly Parton and Crystal Gale! Epic fail!
😂😂😂😂🤪🤪🤡🤡🤡🤡
Still not White
First time I saw Beyoncé was the San Antonio Rodeo.
I just wanted to ad to my comment, I think Beyonce is one of the greatest artists of all time, and one of the most beautiful woman in the world, but country doesn't do it for me. Nothing personal
It was only played it so thay would quit crying because the song sucks she trying to be the opposite of Taylor Swift 😂😂😂😅😅
Nope leave country alone
video is ??? But I love the song!
They spent a lot of money on this video 🤣
I mean, I guess.
It’s not a bad song it’s just hearing her sing country knowing she isn’t country brings it down a notch.
Country has gone to he'll.  Can't believe anyone likes this song
There is hardly any country artists left and she not ONE What she suppose to be a cyborg put clothes on
Personally, she should stick to pop. I think the song sucks, country is something that comes natural, that wasn't even close.
Well that’s crap..😂
I’m not a fan of country or Beyoncé. But this doesn’t sound country but new age!  So why does she need to be half naked all the time!!!!😅
This is hot garbage.
Beyonce can make every song a hit even the bad song like this one
This song makes me wanna turn off my headphones. 🎧🗑️
Good thing they don’t show thumbs down.
It looks a little playgirl
I ain’t never been a fan of hers and this will not move me to become one. Nope, lord no!
Ass
Absolutely terrible
Idk. Not the best country song out there. But at least it's not like some of  those rap/pop wannabe country songs. Still sounds a bit like pop
This shit is trash
I'm not usually a fan of country music but this sounds like every other boring ass country song. Fail.
No t a fan of country music either but I like this!!!! Queen B sang this one!!!!That's why they are mad cause they know if Queen Bee gets a hold of it, it's a rap....
A lot people going to be hating on this album
This straight up sucks.
This is great. That beat sounds like an Old Baptist Church.
Terrible.
Nope
Wow, her voice sucks.
This is the best video they could come up with?
Not impressed.
I love me some QueenBey, but I'm sorry, this is just another stupid "country"- pop song.
Get some clothes on.
This song kind of sucks tbh
I'm gunna like country music cus Beyonce deffo rocks
Beyonce deffo going to win More Grammys cus this tune deffo banger this woman is such a beautiful talented
This is a pretty damn good jam I must say!!! ❤❤❤❤
Nope she has dress this way to get all this attention. I don't like it at all..but that's just my opinion everyone has one.... And do all this cussing...... Trying take over country music by doing this....
Heyyyy it's Franklin! 🤣
Not impressed with video.  Put some clothes on
What a joke. Its a pop song, with few country phrases and some cussing.
She's going make cou try music international. Salute!
Whoever thought that outfit was a good choice should be fired😮
Beyonce & Country does not match
I’m sorry I even gave it a view 🫣
Where’s the line dance with the song?❤
She's really reclaiming the black music genres and bring them back to its roots. First it was house music, now it's country. Can't wait till she redeem rock and roll next.
It's a costume
Idk anything about country or if this is considered “real country” but i do kinda like it
Like the song but the video....
I'm not even a Beyonce fan (no hate, just not my style. She's talented as hell). I came here after watching the Tennessee Brando video defending it from racist assholes. This is damn good!
Pretty good
this is horrendous. saying Texas in your music doesn't make it country
She's proving exactly why she's the queen. And the haters can keep on hating and shes going to keep on making hits.
Enemy infiltration
❤❤❤❤
For all the negative comments.  Powpow shots fired 😂
Eh! Not that impressed. This video is strange!
What the heck is she wearing? She mind as well  get naked.
I like Beyonce but she doesn't sound like a country artist with their song
Franklin theme song!!!!! Beyoncé YOURE TRASH!
Awful 😅
Let me just that Beyoncé just slays everything that she strives out to do. 🤯👏🏾🌟
Now I’m a country boy
This is aweful
Straight fire. 🔥 🔥🔥
TRASH!! THIS WOMAN IS NOTHING BIT TRASH.
Not country at all but not bad either.  I not fan of her personally but I like her stepping out of her comfort zone and still made good music for alot of people enjoy.  That's why music is awesome.  Great artist can change it up all the time and evolve into something even better.  That's what the good ones do.
Lol
This is her attempt at country 😂 wtf is this 💩
Lol what?! Beyoncé just quit you can’t compete anymore with the likes of Taylor Swift… stop embarrassing your self with these stupid moves
Jesus christ thats the most disrespectful 3rd grade bullshit country rap. The illuminati imagery we could do without. Country has class her outfits did not. 3 out of 10
The song is catchy,  but the video is dull as heck...and where's her shirt? Tweens and teens look up to her. "Bey" better.
Why you gotta do the baphomet hand gesture 😞
Congratulations!!!!
This sucks
She forgot to wear a shirt 😮
Not impressed in the least
This isn't country....her voice sounds more like gospel
This shit is Wack! 💩
Put some damn clothes on....
I like the song, it has a good beat and is easy to dance to,  but the video is kinda boring.
D R E A D F U L😂😂😂😂
Song is pretty good. Video is boring as shit.
Ummm…no.
This is my opinion I don’t like it just my opinion
Gotta be the worst example of trying to make money off  your name. Gotta be on of the worst songs I heard in a while, while most of you like it. Look into some real country not someone using there name for money, by switching to a different style of music.
Not a fan of this at all!!
No. Just no. Sounds a mess.
Dalm.. these people are good 😂 nice on the frequency. I see the transition.
Sucks as country Bucks pop. Put your six shooter away
Might as well have done a lyric video watching the same thing visually is giving me Groundhog Day vibes 😂
Country is still awful 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ain’t nobody gonna change that!
Garbage
🎧✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️
Mil veces SHAKIRA ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like this song heard it on my way to work today.
Nice❤
Umm, this ain't  country by a long shot. Whoever said this is country is sadly mistaken.  Have you listened to country in the last 10 years?  God dang
So much money and beautiful outfits she has to wear this ugly
This is pure TRASH !! Shame on you !!!
Country music needs Beyonce to keep it on life support. 😢😂 CMA must be extremely low in views.
This is terrible
Doesn't this fall under culture appropriation? She's literally singing about things she knows nothing about. Stay in your lane
I think too much cleavage number 2 it doesn't really go with her and number three I don't really know it's a good song put the cleavage just a little too much and u have little kids watching this too
Ugh....no. just no
Terrible song
Masterpiece
I wish she was covered up more.
ditch the song . keep the outfit.
Should’ve introduced a new dance with this.. 👍🏾
Not convincing
She's not dressing the part of the country 2:39
I'm leaving this comment so people can look back at 2024 and know at least one person didn't worship at the alter of Beyonce.
Why are y’all so pressed in the comments????? THIS IS NEW AGE COUNTRY THE BEYONCÉ WAY!!!!! Keep watching lol…..
Why bother with clothes … ridiculous!
I'm not usually a fan of country music. and this song ain't helping.
Don’t like it 👎👎👎👎
Taylor Swift keep getting in the way now Bee about to take that witch title 😂
Wtf is this 😂
Music in general is in sad shape if people think this is both country and “brilliant”.
Diplo, look what you've started! 😂
Not a fan of this at all. Wasted my time listening to this
Only cool thing about this song . Is she almost naked
Sounds like a song she can collaborate with Dolly Parton .
I love the song, but the video is stupid
It is a very complex song  with very intricate lyrics. A lot of thoughts put into the writing.
Trash
Lmao trashy as can be. We don't need this trash in country music
Move over Taylor, Queen B is back.
Not today at least put some clothes on
🔥 🗑️
LMAO. Fuck No.
This was trash.  Not sure how anyone listens to this.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you can just do any genre you feel like.  None of her stuff is good.  I'm also testing to see if the algorithm starts showing me more of her videos because I commented.
I remember cardi b saying country charts would be an easy genre to dominate a #1 and here comes Beyoncé 😂
She stole that beat from Franklin the turtle. Unoriginal horrible song with broken ass lyrics. And when did country songs have Lexus’s in them????
It's funny Nelly never earned the recognition merging hip-hop & country. Not an avid country listener. But,this song is sure as hell NOT country music.
garbage
This is NOT country!!! Horrible song. She is not that talented. It's 💩
This is ridiculous, this is not country.  I’m sorry but added a banjo to a song doesn’t automatically make it country.  Stupid, it’s not even a good song.  I think it’s stupid and repeats the same thing for 3:30 minutes🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
For the money she has could she not buy herself a t shirt🙄🙄
T R A S H!!!
I do not consider this real country music at all!
Would be awesome if she actually duet with an unreleased Johnny Cash or Toby Keith track.
I live Beyonce but that ain't country
Bey then invaded country!!! Go girl!!!
Dumb video
$$$$$$$$
The video is boring. How many times is she going to slide her finger to her boobs? This is the best they could offer this “country” video? Weak.
Dam, that's good
Wow. Do we really need to be half naked? Showing our young girls this is how we need to dress to get attention. Such a shame because she has such a beautiful voice.
Wtf
As a fan of country i thought i was gonna be angry but nahh she gets a pass here. I mean its hard to ruin a country song BUT its possible. Thank you Beyonce! Do a song with Dolly.
Awful
Song is trash, video is 🔥
TRASH 🗑️
I would rather just watch hey Franklin original then hear her using the hey Franklin theme song trying to make it a new country hit! Lmao this song sucks I like Beyoncé but this song absolutely sounds like shit.
No thank you.
Still not a fan of either. Just not my vibe.
SKANK!!!
She is an insult to Texas her and her Illuminati self can go straight to what she sold her soul to HELL
Failed to meet my expectation.
Stupid video. I guess no one told Beyonce country is about the story, not sex.
NOT
Yes grrrrl!
This is the most god-awful hideous bullshit I've ever heard! Tracy Lawrence please!!
👎🏽
haters may hate but this is a really good song...
She did dat
Great dressed. What a tribute to women.  Ridiculous
Um why the replay button stuck
The cussing kinda makes it sound unnecessarily inauthentic. For no reason really. As a Nashville native. Kinda a little too thuggish. To be honest.
Uck
🫴🏼❤️‍🔥👏🏼Now we need a remix with jelly roll and dixie chicks 😁😂
I like the song a lot. This video though.... Is that all there is? Her half naked pointing two fingers like a gun? Ummm.... OK.🤷‍♀
Is this what people think country is ?
Absolutely the worst song ever. Without auto tune she’s horrible
When she gonna put some clothes on?  She has 3 kids.
Some telecaster and steel guitar fills and breaks by some Nashville cats would be a nice add, but that is purely a personal preference.
Omg this is truly horrible... check your lane.
shes from f****** Texas, I cant believe the push back...
It’s just so bad I’m aorry
I'm not into this at this point maybe it will grow but not really country sorry
How did she memorize that choreography?
Song is alright but seriously what's up with the outfit kinda trashy well really trashy kinda no need for it
Ummm NO!! She ain’t ever stepped on dirt let alone had it on her hands…. This ain’t Texas ain’t no hold em???? What does that even mean.  She’s just saying words.  Did she have a stroke?
This song sucks! 😂🤡👎🏼
Maybe I need to hear it again. I loved Dolly Parton I will always love you first time I heard it.
Now all you people who don't like country music don't start liking it now🥴😂
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
No 😂😂😂
Awful what was she thinking. Not country
Sorry. She’s a great singer but doesn’t have the country voice.
Girl we don't want ur music in our genre. This isn't even country.
She hadn’t got for Country especially the dress part 🤨Give it up ,only woke listen to her any way . Everyone said look how tacky she looks or I would’ve watched it anyway ‼️ I need a barf bucket ‼️🤨
Yo, ain't this that hit from the Franklin the Turtle cartoon? Didn't know Beyonce was on some Franklin. Dope.
Sucks
The song is pretty good but I don’t get the video.
🤭
Why the video when it’s the same thing in repeat.  🙄
Idk how so mamy people actually like this, probably because its beyonce singing it. If some no name artist did this song, theyd get so much hate for it, honestly. But ima be honest, id rather listen to baby shark than hear this song. Beyonce is a good singer, shes a queen, but this song feels like a fuckin joke. It starts off with some potential, has a good beat, okay lyrics and then as soon as the "theres a tornado" lyrics pop up i am immediately lost. The lyrics no longer make sense and it gets worse as the song progresses. I grew up with country, pop country, and pop all my life and this song just says wtf to me, its not country at all, it just lets me down. Youd expect something really great bc hello its beyonce, but then this song is just trash. I showed it to my mom and told her id rather listen to baby shark, and she started singing baby shark over the song while it was playing. We listened to it under the post of someone else and the top comment was saying how this song sucked, so i know for a fact im not the only one who thinks this. This is not country or pop country at all
Last time I heard a country song from a lady it didn’t have any curse words in it. I don’t like it you’re wannabe you’re never gonna be.
Love it
Jay-Z behind that BS .
The Song Is Ok Video Is On Trashly  !!!
Why sexialize it?
I don't really care for it. I really love Bey...but I also live a cowgirl life and actually love country music too. This sounds like 80s and early 90s country music. It has an old fashioned feel to it, and I like more modern country and especially Southern Soul Country music (black folks country music). I guess I'll just check out some more of her country songs...I'm sure I'll find something I like.
Absolutely not. What is she going to be half naked at the CMT awards and curse during her song? Come on have some class.
Loved the song until I saw this video😫
It's a no for me.
Finally a country song that isn’t about a wife/girlfriend leaving you be you won’t quit drinking, a pickup truck turned over because you tried to outrun your 3rd DUI in a month, and/or a dog running away with your now ex-wife/girlfriend.
I like the outfit. The song not so much
This is literally ass.
STOP!!! Please STOP!!!! She ain't all that!
Yeah it’s Beyoncé but this ain’t it yall.
This shit so trash stay in ur lane !
Y’all need some Bill Hicks in your life.   https://youtu.be/grBAL5vI7DE?si=O5j_gFSGfqbqeIkj
Here's the thing. I don't care if Beyonce wants to do a country song. More power to her. But, I don't can't respect the way she shows her breast and her front bottom. At least taylor swift doesn't go that far. Country music, and these new ladies in country, why show you naked skin like that? I think many are pushing the envelope. NO, I am not racist. I voted for President Joe Biden. Because he is the right man for the job. The right man to get the dangerous man trump out. So, lets not even go there. I love Taylor Swift. She started out as country, and now she's more pop. I respect that Taylor Swift won't show her nakedness like Beyonce. This would have been a better video, had she not been half naked. Beyonce, isn't she from Texas? Whatever, she has the right to do a song about Texas or any song she chooses. I just think country music shouldn't be introduced in the likes of this. Put some clothes on girl. This is country music. You have the right to do country, but to be honest I'm an old woman I grew up listening to country, and stepped away from some country music because  of these maga republicans. They too should be ashamed, the way they support the most dangerous president, Donald Trump, we've EVER had. The destruction he's caused. I think Beyonce knew this was going to ruffle some feathers. And, maybe she's trying to make a statement by doing country and dressing half naked. I'm not impressed. But, I could be impressed if Beyonce dressed with more clothes on. She sure dresses up country music. What a voice. That's all I'm saying.
Lovin it ❤
Whack! 😂
Gadgets, is the dive bar
Disappointing.
So country is basically soft porn now?
Dang, this makes me wanna be country SO HARD 🫦
whenever female performers dress like that it's to get the attention they know their music won't get.  Have you ever seen Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell or Carole King dress like that?  No.  Their music speaks for itself.
Just showed this to my mom to get her reaction and she goes...  "Isn't her mom the one who makes her clothes? You would think she would cover her up more !"   😂
not country, by any stretch of the imagination. you can put lipstick on a pig, but its still a pig!
It’s not really country… but why whore it up like that claiming “country”
Fits right in with all the other garbage that calls itself country. Nice work.
Wow, this is trash!! You can't use banjo music Beyonce and think you can sing country 😂😂😂😂
Horrible—Absolutely horrible. She had to go half naked to make people wanna watch.
Do you own a shirt
They could’ve been just a little bit more creative with the music video…
lol lame
This isn't country really. It's a little more country than that lumberjack song with the harmonica in the beginning. It's pop music with a few country touches at best. That doesn't mean it's bad but it's not considered country music in my book and I wouldn't blame country stations for not playing it. It belongs on pop stations.
Beautiful song top byonce 🙂
I’m sorry that’s not country it’s awful and she needs too put some cloths on I love country and that dosent sound like it at all
No self respect
This song sucks
And notice her gun has a silencer attached 😂!
Horrible country song. Stay in your lane Beyonce. This song made no sense at all. It sounds more like a commercial to buy a kite. 😆
I love this side of her
🙂
Again as little clothes as possible, what is she selling body or bad country music😅😅😅😢
We already knew she was trash.😅😅 But a good song
I wonder who really wrote this song? Since it’s common knowledge she steals credit, and uses her power to force the real writers into signing NDA’s.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
Disgusting dress. Or should I say undressed. Song itself not that bad. Her presentation of it horrible.
😂 this is terrible. Was the song written in like ten minutes?
Bless her heart is all I have to say!!!
I'm just here for the this ain't country comments and who created country, black folk or white folk. However, that said. Who cares who created what genre of music. This is more pop, but for those that REALLY wanna know. Here's some factual history about it, anyone can google, google is your friend...:) James Charles Rodgers (September 8, 1897 – May 26, 1933) was an American singer-songwriter and musician who rose to popularity in the late 1920s. Widely regarded as the "Father of Country Music", he is best known for his distinctive yodeling. Rodgers was known as "The Singing Brakeman" and "America's Blue Yodeler". He has been cited as an inspiration by many artists, and he has been inducted into multiple halls of fame. That being said, whether or not you're down for this STYLE/RYTHEM or GENRE of music, being a former musician myself. I found myself tapping to the BEAT, which is totally different than the song, in it's ENTIRITY which is composed of many different elements. Sorry for the rant, y'all but this is more r & b, and pop. Keith urban for example, he's country pop, so is luke bryan. I was in denial myself, about this so-called COUNTRY POP, but it is a thing. People gave Taylor Swift heat, when she swapped from POP TO COUNTRY. I think they even cracked  jokes about it. So, whether or not she did it for a publicity stunt, she got us ALL talking about BEYONCE. Keep on Jammin!!! can we NOT fight over music??? but, i guess it's better than politics Lol ...:) it's not TOO BAD, imo. I just don't dig R & B. Elvis Presley, may have or possibly could have, collabed with Beyonce, if he was still alive. I think he was heavy into R & B, himself. Hopefully, he approves!!! Whatever it is, just enjoy the music PLEASE...:) Sorry for the novelish rant. Yes, whomever posted about black folks, influence on country is TECHNICALLY banjo's, if I got it right. Enjoy!!! i first heart this song on my friend's tiktok feed, and had to come check it out.
Boo you suck
She's more beautiful without all of the sexualization 🤠
Yassssss bey
Im super enjoying this!!!!   Fuck you john snyder
This video sucks lol I thought country music was about storytelling. She just found another way to call you bitch 😝
Hahahahaha he dared us to sing about the “movie!” The bands
It's been a long time coming.  This is one of the greats.
Sorry....that ain't country.
Wonder who wrote this
Lots of left eyes gone Loretta! Pods guessing too
Toddies
This is garbage
Beyoncé is very talented. Why does she think she has to show her body to get attention? Totally sickening.the fall of a great talent
This song is only good for a tik tok dance like everybody has started doing
Mid song. Sorry
This is one of the smoothest examples I have ever seen of a popstar being more country than Jason Aldean. She’s actually  more country than most of the new artists out there. I’m pure country, and I like this. It has such a drive and positive vibe to it. I don’t know who’s idea this was, but somebody nailed it on the head. As far as John Schneider saying it was like a dog urinating, that wasn’t what he said. He meant that liberal musicians crossing over into country music was likened to a dog marking his territory. A dog has to mark everything, and that was his reference that liberals are getting into everything. I couldn’t give two shits about her politics, this is a bad ass tune. Musicians and politics should never mix. I hope the rest of the album is just as good.
ALL I can say is Jesus Christ! The feelings I get from this song. I grew up on Kenny Rogers you BETTER believe I know country music! This women is a G0D DAMN genius! Absolutely brilliant is grossly an understatement. YEAH! Queen Be! Long live the Queen! I feel enlightened! I'm taking MY energetic @$$ to sleep! Unbelievable.
❤️
Fine afffffff this woman immortal
Song is absolutely whack!!! 😂 PERIOD! Y'all really only like this song because its her...that's it! She has put a spell on the beehives! 😂
Thought this would be a nice cowgirl theme. A bit sad it's just a naked lady walking around
No thanks
Oh yeah, to the floor, foot is a stompin'
She sounds exactly the same as her regular music but saying country words with country music playin in the background thats it. Thats all. Its absofuckinlutely a flop. K Michelles country music sounds a million times better. Just stop pls witch
I'm a 50+ year old white Southern woman who just enjoyed my first country song. Thanks for sharing your genius Bey
Weak. We don't want her in country. She's already rich enough. Pay attention to the women who've been in country. Not her. This is laughable
Bey you did a Excellent job I’m a Country Music Fan
I love this it's a real live boogie let's two step y'all🥰😂🎉. Very different I love this
Beyonce has everybody in a chokehold w this song lol 😅  ❤Virgo ♍️ BABY*
Constant Replay on video scene, boring the only thing that sells about this song is her tata's...boring spread'm next time, bang, bang!!!!
The lyrics are questionable - why we got to be b_ _ _ _ _ _ s
Absolutely horrible she needs to stick to the other music that she. Of course I never thought Beyonce was that great anyway.
Oro puro ❤
Directly transferred from tik tok
Another shitty song from her.
Hahaha! That's not country and wtf why is she trying to look like a white girl? She trying to be Taylor ? That outfit too
Yeahhh, still don’t care for her music, back to the oldies✌🏼
Omg! Now she has to ruin country! I’m puking !
Lesgoo beyhive lets make it #1 billboard for next week
This is wack sauce
Go home Beyoncé. You’re not country. Stick to what you’re used to.  I do not like this song
I been a country fan,I’m from HTown,Texas like Beyoncé so we both country girls at heart! Congratulations Bey!
Beyoncé born and raised in Houston Texas! This ain’t her first Rodeo Love the song!
Horrible .....   Pure garbage
Gross! No.
😂😂
Commercialized like all country music now
She should just take that wrap that’s on her shoulders 😂😂
This track is straight up yee haw !  I like it very much 👍🏻 🤠
🔥🔥🔥
I love the sound she cultivated. It honors both her Texas roots and her urban music roots! She made it seemless!
How is this garbage country ??
Yes Bey❤️❤️🫶🏽🫶🏽
This sucks.
It’s aight 🤷🏽‍♀️
Wait, she just repeats the same soft-porn video snippet again and again?
TRASH !!!!STICK TO YOUR ILLUMINATI MEETINGS
Meh
😂🤮 Stupid video.
I have been waiting for Bey to sing country!!❤❤
This is a dumb video. She makes cowgirls look bad she can't even dance like a cowgirl.
Really that's how she's going to that's an insult to country music
Nope👎👎👎👎Stay In Your Lane.
Soooo what makes this country??? 🤔
Love it ,Beyonce is there anything you can't sing?
She is talented and good for her for branching out... but I cannot get behind this being a good country song. Mixing soggy bottom boys and an idea of what country should sound like does not make for good music
I think it's pathetic and what has showing your tits have to do with talent or lack of I am people saying they like something just because that's what we are conditioned to do just saying
This is not country. People are funny
Bey Bey, you did this! 🐝💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I love it!
Don't forget Monica had done one too a few years back I don't know if she ever put it out
Pls stick to wht you kn baby this is not it.
Omg she sounds awful 😅😂😂 country singer Not Not put some dam clothes on country people don't dress like that
No this heifer isn't trying to be country. COUNTRY MUSIC is this what's it's coming to? Black country rap shit and half dressed. You think these people would try to be a upstanding roll model
HIT.... SCHEIDER FROM THE DUKES OF HAZZARD...YOU CAN KISSS MY ASSSSS. THAT'S MONEY!
Video sucks but song is catchy and she looking good
Not country 😒😑🤦
I loved it congratulations Queen 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Say What?  ??  Uhm 😒😒 no. Beyonce can sing R&B, Funk and Blues ( 👏👏😂her Caddilac Records ) but this... I don't think so. I am a man who loves country music .
This isn’t country!
I've been listening to country music for 30 years,  I don't like it. It's not country. The B word unnecessary. That outfit is awful. If you can't be true country I guess you may as well be half naked. Country mystic has a faithful fan base and we don't need this. It so making it a race thing, this is simply not country.
Helllllll tooooo the naahhhhhhhh
The Franklin the turtle theme song 😂 💀
CowBey 😍
This is pure trash country is definitely not this - her outfit is trash and she’s using herself as an over sexualized person to sell her  music
Holy shit, I already hated modern country. This isn’t country, this is a money grab. The same dumb lyrics over and over is the only thing that might link it to country music. Fucking terrible
WTW????!!!-😆UR RIGHT THIS AINT TEXAS!!! & THIS SURE THE HELL AINT COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!!!! 💯💯💯💯WHO IN THE HOLIEST R U TRYING TO IMPREESS!!!!!! SURE NOT GONNA BE NASHVILLE!!!!! KITTY WELLS, LORETTA LYYNN, PATSY CLINE TOBY KEITH, KEITH WHITLEY TURNING IN THE HEAVENS!!!!! BY THE WAY "OUR CLASSY COUNTRY WOMEN " DONT DRESS LIKE A HARLOT!!!!!!!!!💯💯💯 & DONT CURSE LIKE U DO!!   💯💯💯💯😞😮
Always Said, the only difference between RNB & Country. Was the beat🤌🏽🤷🏽‍♂️
Bey tryin' to catch Tay...only problem is, Country muzik fanz aren't stupid hicks you can just throw up at (this isn't Bey's level of art, THIS IS CLICK BAIT...).  Blue Ivy & Music fans of all genres are offended at this waste of 4 minutes...Too bad Bey doesn't have a real producer/manager in her life (Jay😴)...if we managed & produced Beyonce's transition/debut to Country Music; we would have had You work with the real homegirlz of Country "Chapel Heart" as an appearance/promo on their next album, THEN had You say how much you enjoyed it & felt a connection to the other half of America while realizing a need to work with Nashville writers to create art You could experience with these newer fans.  Take back this CLICK BAIT & HATE...we'll wait🙏🏿
💃🏽 💃🏽 💃🏽
That's nice background music for this holograph video.
I don't get it.  Is this visualization questionable as MTV Europe pop rock was to us in USA back in the day? Sledgehammer artistic was weird.
Ok, he he he..
Ya. Not really country me thinks .least not the 50 years worth I've listened to here in the country. 😊
That's not country attire! Have respect! Not Cool B!!
I will say good for Bey on dipping her feet in different types of music. Although I'm not into country of any kind. I just can not and will not force it. Happy for her as always, it's just not for me.
What sort of a video clip is this?
Not country
This is so nice, I don't listen to much of Beyonce's music but I really like this. She did a beautiful job crossing over ❤
Wow great, number 1 bound..
I'm not being weird or anything but this whole video is THISSSSSSSSSSS close to demonetization lol
This is not country music.
Absolute garbage, that ain't country. Thats a disgrace to the country music
I'm not a big fan of Country, but I am impressed!
I Love it love it YES❤
🗑️
😂😂😂😂 I'm done 🤦🏽‍♀️
A great country song from Queen Bey? Well, shut my mouth and slap my face!
What a disgrace...🙄...so now she is trying to be the ppl she hates on...ok!👍👎🤣
WwwwhhhaaaaaAaHhhaaaa!!!!!!!!!....... NO.
Just No!
Meh. Kylie did country better!
"We Like Them Boys That Be In The Back Leanin- And Always Be Speakin That Country Slang" She Been Putting On For The South. Especially Early On. She IS a Texan. But This Shits More Pop Than Country To Me. Not a Bad Song. But Not Country To Me, Even For Mainstream.
No
Playing 10x a day
MORE COUNTRY MUSIC FROM BEYONCE PLEASE!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this song just fucking sucks
Where’s her clothes? Dear me😳
Dang she came a took they craft, (snap!) Just like that!😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Beyoncé u murder this 🎶 fuck it up ima a RiRi fan damn u make me feel like a cowboy 🤠 frfr ima from NC ig TX to NC go ahead Beyoncé
This is such a repetitive song lol all she does is repeat the same lyrics the entire song
I'm not usually a fan of country music, but this make me really hate country now.
This isn't even country...😂 it's her same shit...just her talking about what she thinks "country" is?? Stupid...
She can go back from where she came from. She's not country.
This ain't your daddies cowgirl ❤❤
This ain't no country song😂😂😂😂 but it's racist if she dosnt get a CMA award, wait for it. The woke mob are coming.   also why is she culturally appropriating our blonde hair, black people don't get blonde hair. They have one colour, that's jet black.
I love Beyonce's music. Beyonce is NOT country. This song is proof.  Just my opinion.
Ufffffffffff🙌🏻🙌🏻
Trash. Idiotic if you call this country…
It's cute but this isn't a country song😅😅
Beyoncé is really trying to tell us that she is an alien.
Cultural Appropriation
Trash
My ears are bleeding
It's no "Old Town Road."
All the lanes!! ❤
🤮
"Country music" for people who don't like Country Music... I think it's called pop
So country music and half naked…. like American and Apple Pie.
^^^ as a PROUD houstonian, all that i can say is... MY GOODNESS, BEYONCE!  🔥🎵♥🔔😇🌵
Finally something Beyonce can't do! And titties out in country!
What’s with the video? Could’ve done so much more with this
Love it, Queen.  💯💯💯👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
As a Texan I'm so proud of this moment and song!
This is far more country than most songs in the country charts lately.
Idk whether this song is good or terrible like I love it yet hate it idk if this was too much , just right, or too little. Idk wtf is going on 🤣💀
We all know black people started country music
Only her!! ...Fantastic!🎉🎉🎉❤
I don’t remember female country singers being naked. It’s usually about the music.
This isn't country, far from it. But I do say, it's a good song. POP song.
❤ Franklin
Not country but whatever...and most country music on radio isn't country anyways.
About what I expected.  Ass.
“Can’t beat Taylor so become Taylor” if she was a person.. 😂
Beyonce and Taylor Swift should hire designers to freshen up country wear for Texas women, we need it bad! We do not have every day clothes, all the clownish clothes they make for women right now tries hard to me women look like little boys or whores. Texas designers are afraid of color. Beyonce's white stetson hat should be Beyonce's Stetson hat 4 to 4 1/4 brim and 4 5/8 crown is perfect love it! someone need to use the color wheel more often! We love color!
Lmao stealing the Franklin the turtle theme song 😂😂😂🤦‍♀️
Love it
You GO GIRL! Dang Beyonce is even more lovely doing country music beautiful tone and great music
This sucks
Love it
Cheap
Showing white ppl how country is done.
Happy for you
Shitty
She can do anything. Of course it's good.
She killed this genre just like all the rest 🔥🔥🤤🥴🫶🏽
I love it 🥰 ❤❤❤
country is a state of mind
Beyonce and Reyna Roberts need to collaborate
A great singer can sing any genre of music...
Ending gave me chills
Bey you are super amazing. May God continue to Bless you and that you dream,vision and touch.
This anit even country this some weird hybrid
This shits trash...🤣
Just a pure musical genuis❤❤❤
She just can't handle the fact that Taylor Swift is demolishing her in every way. This song is garbage. Let's be honest how many black people in Houston TX are actually country? I bet less than 1%
Dang,  it's actually pretty good
This is not country. And put some clothes on
How embarrassing. This is horrible.
43 and more naked than before
Not bad… brings something different
Beyonce look good af they gonna play this song like Brittany spear’s toxic till everyone likes it 😂
me taking a shit sounds better . 😂
First, Beyonce was country even before she was born, second, she sings so good she can sing whatever she wants and what is more, if she learns Spanish she can sing all the songs she wants. There are unique folk that are born (one) in a couple of million and it is not random, God just took a little more time with people like Beyonce and my long legged blond blue eyed beauty Taylor Swift that were gifted by God for humans to enjoy listening too. What do they lack? They have beauty, intelligence, they can sing, write, put music to the lyrics and dance to them too. I just grow thanking God for his good works. It is not something they did, is all God almighty Jehovah at work, just a little sample of His goodness. Beyonce and Taylor don't even know what is all the fuss about, they are just as amazed as we are to the impact they have on regular folk like me that don't know how to sing dance or anything else. Thank you God your are loved!
John Schneider is so mad now…🤣🤣🤣.  Get em Bey. First black woman number 1 country song.
How has this been out for over a week and I haven’t heard a thing about this? Blasphemy ! It’s so good! I hope she gets the Chicks to sing this with her at some point!
This is a joke 😂
Welp, I like Beyoncé now.
Why is it necessary to show tits bouncing under hot set lights, gross. Can't the song and the talent be enough?
actually like it way better than her pop music.
This is straight garbage. Please stop.
Stupid. If you’re gonna sing a country song a be country, don’t be dressing like you from the streets. This ain’t hip-hop🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
What a terrible video
she's doing country better than most long-term country artists
I love it❤❤❤
Nice. Now I’m waiting on the line/tictok dance to it🤣
Like the song but not what she is wearing or not wearing
No money for a real video! :(
She needs a bigger bucket
I don’t see this as country at all maybe a cool pop song demon women still sexy tho..  just cause you put a banjo in the back ground of the  song don’t make it country lol
If you listen closely you realize this is Beyoncé
Beyonce and miranda lambert collab next? 👀
Shocking that literally anyone can make country music..... cus its a joke genre
My ears are bleeding.
It's a good song but someone pointed out she sampled from Franklin the turtle theme song and yep sure does sound like it. At the beginning  This one is just more up beat a little.  Just thought that was funny. I honestly don't think this song is bad though.
Not a fan of hers but can’t deny this is catchy af and I like it.  It’s fun, take it for what it is.  The visualizer tho?  We all know she looks great, could have had more than one image over and over.   But I’m not mad at the country stuff from her so far.  I’m a country fan, this is more country pop but def fun.  Awaiting the endless line dances this shall set off lollll
Alright! I was skeptical but this that honky tonk sht country mainstream missing. Thank you!!! People forget its supposed to make ya feel good
Was für ein cooler Song,🎶💃
If you can get me boppin to a country song, you did somethin!! This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have never, and will never like Beyonce and now that she is making a mockery of Country music.  Please stay in your genre.  Everyone is coming to Country, first Post Malone, now Beyonce.  Ya'll stay in your lane and us Country music lovers will darn sure stay in ours!!!
I'm not liking the video. I expect more than this. If you compare Beyonce's videos with this one, you see it fail to meet her status.😮
😂 MOST OF YA R&B 🎶 NOT GOOD. NOW YA TRYING COUNTRY 🤠👎THIS IS NOT NO COUNTRY🎵 ANY THAT THINK IT IS 🤔 SUMTHN WRONG W/YA👂👂🙉 🙄🤣
Houston Texas Rodeo,gone wear this out Cowboy boots Daisy Dukes Plaid shirts
DAYUMM SHE'S SEXXY!!! ❤
Let's go!!!
Wanna be Taylor swift 😂
It’s not really giving country tbh
This song is garbage
It's 🔥🔥🔥

Beyonce has been called country since Destiny Child 's debut. Now she is doing country and being told she's not country enough 🤔
I like it.

Are real cowgirls dressed like this? 🤔
How can you like this and not be a fan of country. It’s always the celebrity dick riders, the type who care more about the name attached to it rather than the quality and talent of the performer. Thank You Beyonce for a song that doesn’t sound like shit, could’ve done with something more country than the commercial esc whistle solo. Harmonica would’ve been hilarious and amazing at the same time.
Ummmmmm.....
I don't like Beoncé at All. Looks like this honkeytonk has joined the dark side now.
This still sounds to pop
It’s the goofy video for me that’s a hell no I think the song is silly  Kinda reminds me of achy Breaky heart not my cup of tea
Trash
🎉❤😊
This is just trash.
Go Beyoncé! This is great.
😂
Love, that down home Crounty Beat. Rock N Country.
Do with nothing on
This sounds so forced, talk about pandering
I hate country. But this song and Fast Car have been on my playlist all week!
As a country fan I was hoping this would actually be good but it's mediocre just like the rest of her music. Man I hope this is her only country single
Bey won’t be denied. Period.
Such good country music!! Makes me want to buy my hat and boots NOW.
This isn't even country man. Disgraceful. And, yall didn't originate country in its entirety so stop with that bs narrative. 😒
Garbage
This song sucks
it's who she is, never forget her roots! job masterfully done. Gettie up girl🤠
Excellent ❤🎤💯👏🏼👏🏼
I luv it B I like country music 🎶 ❤and I am from the south
Damn, the visuals looks like a po*rn movie😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cringe 🥴
Sorry.  Not country
Guess it’s country in 2024 🤘🏻
Yall can't be mad at Texas artist who may not care for this as much.  Do we as rappers for example, not give the side eye to some of these artist be it culture vultures or even rappers they deem to be trash. It is what it is. Relax
you stick to r&b, oml this sucks....
Why aren't there any good musicvideos??
Put so dang clothes on!
Good debut in the Hot 100 #2 in top 10
Love the music but don't care for the flesh.
J-Hope (of BTS) is releasing his new album “HOPE ON THE STREET” on March 29th 2024
I hate people trynna say why she made this song just because it’s country? It still sounds amazing
She snapped yo
Good music, but she doesn’t have to be essentially naked to do this, this is so degenerate
BeyHive! Beyonce is now the first black woman to EVER reach #1 on Billboards Hot Country Songs! 👑🐝
Bringin her Satanic Witchcraft to country music.   Boooo. you guys must be under her spell, this song is no masterpiece, it's boring simple song most likely written by AI -  It's a piece alright.
The song is terrible.
I mean it’s good but she is a way better dancer and entertainer in her genre.  What’s with this vid😳
It’s an ok song… it still doesn’t feel like a country song just because she says texas and has banjos
Alexis Jones will you be my wife???
Everyone here in the comment doesn’t listen to country they listen to Beyoncé lol this song is the worst country song fake as fuck. This ain’t country will never be country stop trying to pander to maga fans Beyoncé I know what you are doing lol it funny and sick at the same time.
💐💐💐💐💐💐
Nas x destroyed me ever trusting two people making country music….. the song sucks too… I think Beyoncé is pandering to people who would buy her music… she not doing it for the music it’s the money…. Don’t let this trash get on the country stations please or I will boycott the radio too
I was born and raised in Tennessee and disagree with John Schneider's take on artists like Beyonce who want to make country music.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with someone, regardless of who you are or are not to the world, wanting to do their own style of country.  Just because she's this huge figure in another genre and married to one of the best rappers of all time doesn't warrant prejudice.    Not to mention Beyonce was born in Houston, Texas and I'm sure has had her fair share of being a country girl aside from her normal, seemingly glamorous side.  I started this paragraph out as "I was born and raised in Tennessee' but you don't have to be.  You feel what you feel and regardless of what others may say your happiness and place of peace is yours.  Don't allow anyone to take that from you.  I love several genres and would like to think my opinions and contributions to such would be welcomed.  Do your thing Beyonce ❤
I am a country fan❤
Also baffled by some many people who think this is good. The Illuminati has you
Such a masterpiece delivered at the right moment in time space and history.  Visuals for all the videos are deeper than any DSN satellites delivering A.I information to the Americans that need the honest truth the most.  It’s all good. God outsmarts governments every time since God governs the mind.  Love & don’t make us shoot the piece instead of spreading peace. Just saying.  Godbless
Absolutely would return this to get my money back. Absolutely trash
Like this track....❤❤❤
How classy. Put some clothes on.
Why is everything heavily sexualized?
Not sure if she noticed but... country folk wear CLOTHES
Demonic Hoeee down
Let’s goooooo🎉 breaking boundaries
yes was driving in my lexus wen this song came on jamming in the car yes queen 🙌🙌😍😘🥂
Is it just me or is this video a lot of nothing?   Doesn't seem to go with the song.
I don’t even like country and here I am just 🐜🦟🐜🦟🐜🦟🐜🦟🐜🦟
This is absolutely awesome. I love country music when it has a slightly modern twist on it. Beyoncé just served us a real yeeee hawwwww bop and I’m here for it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 🤠
Best version of this song I've ever heard!!
So porn found it's way into country music
I’m not a fan of Beyoncé’s news songs, I grew up in the late 90s Y2K era, I liked destiny’s child. But this country song hits in my soft spot, especially as a Texan. Yeeha!
Bey''s, a texans, do your thing honey!!!😊😂🎉🎉❤..
😊😊
I don't like country even when it's beyonce. I can't get mad at her for wanting to try something new though.
plssssss, NO
Hey Franklin was such a good kids show
Can I just say Darius Rucker, Taylor Swift and others have crossed genres it's no big deal, although I did not like the song I wish her well😊
Is this the official music viddy? Cause I’m confused after the 6th loop lol 😅
I just love this not because it’s Beyonce but simply because it is country music made by Beyoncé because I love country music and I would have never expected her to make country music & this is so catchy. It also fits in with R&B songs too for mashups for club nights😂💯🤠Wonderful✨
So what do you call this???? Not Country stick to your Hip Hop RnB looking all sleazy.. And Does Not Believe In GOD..She chose to be on the Devil Side. Dad for Country Music
I came here for a reason not to like it, but after I heard it I like it. Maybe if people would listen to it before reading all the hate articles about her trying country they would like it too
Simplesmente perfeita em qualquer ritmo que se propõem <3
Park your Lexus.  Uh no
This song sucks
great song, but totally boring video
Shit is garbage I’m sorry
Haters aside..this is a lovely country song❤
This isn’t even country music
It reminds me with its vibe of Kings Of Leon „Back down south” and I love it!
This video performance is crap. Dance or something.
She getting TIRED of Taylor being in the news. She decided "fuck it im gonna do what she used to do. Lets see how it works out. If i don't get a grammy after this . Imma snap that twig bish"
That ENDING 💖
When has Beyonce and Jay-Z been to the dive bar?? 😭
Yeah, this will be played in the background while shopping at some point..
Love this song so much!
This ain't no "country" music 🤨
🔥
Meh..
We all have to pretend this song isn’t hot garbage because it’s Beyoncé
Absolutely garbage 🤮
Am I the only who finds this funny l😂
This is pop...this ain't country...
This is mot a country song period 😢😢
Country music don’t have to cuss or profane nor show breast. That’s why for me thumbs down.
She’s a Texas girl ❤
Wow what can’t we do ❤amazing art
Song not to bad But the outfit she might as well be nude bad image for young girls & boys Alot of young people listen to country. Bad example if the singer can sing why do they half clothes their self to draw attention
Say what you want but im over her and everything her fam does...
Dial hard country music, fan here, and was very skeptical. I admit of how Beyoncé would sound as a country artist always loved to work from Destiny’s Child all the way up I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  And I must admit she has more of a country sound than most country artists have today.  But quite frankly today’s country isn’t country at all
Is it fear that Beyoncé will do country music better than those country 'singers' doing it for years the reason for all this outrage? 😂😂😂 Do ya thang girl! Racists are too ridiculous...
This is the worst ever
Pure trash
More Illuminnatti simbolism. The snake on the eye and repeating the pose of baphomet over and over again. Its incredible how they can make it look so "Inocent"and be like "its just pistols but in reality they meeting is deeper than what people without knowledge can see. Disgusting.
Love it❤
Sorry this is not country music
The only famous person that I would want to meet when I'm famous is Gayle King.Thats why Oprah is her friend and Oprah is grateful .Gayle she's herself all the time and she's classy she know her boundaries..
She can do anything... stunning ..🤤 she already took me to Tennessee. 10. Ps sucks her man had to say it .. but she deserved the award.. no doubt 100
Wow!!!! Good for Beyonce!!!! Excellent song!!!!
This isn't country. It's soulful.
🔥 🔥 🔥
Not bad
I didn't know that African Americans created Country Music & were the original COWBOYS!  AAs were Cow-Boys whites were Cow-Hands until everyone wanted to be a COWBOY 🤠
Ridiculous
This shit is trash 🗑️ no place for you in country music or Nashville   45 writers and 32 producers for a shitty song   Toby Keith and Waylon be laughing at you 😂
How do they find that banjo sound on the beat machine
Paid reviews. Tina's an enabler.
Yeah this ain’t it for Beyoncé
I mean it's catchy... 💃🏻
This song is the tits! 😂
I perfer K Michele, im so tired of her trying to steal everyone shine
That banjo at the beginning gets me hype as fuckkkkkk
The GOAT Queen is unparalleled.  Mych respect 🙌 👏
I feel seduced 😂 she’s seducing the country community
This is given me barney vibes. press school vibes.
This ain’t country sorry lmao trash
I'm pleasantly impressed.  I'll have this one on repeat
The video is lackluster
not a fan of new country nusic but i like this.
Amooo essa vibe desde Daddy lessons
This song sucks
Lol ,I just heard  it on KRBE, I fully expected to see her dancing 💃.  Nope.  Just half naked..
❤
I like the song 🎵 nice beat to it. Watch out Ya'll 🎉🎉🎉
Oh, man... I'm kinda sad to say this but this one just didn't hit for me. It's not terrible it's just very lackluster for Beyonce 😢
She dresses up like a stripper. She's switched to country  and probably the 1st song where she isn't shaking her body like in a siezure ..all her music is written by hired song writers and lyricists.. nothing classy about her.
Oh god 🤮
If this sucks, GIVE ME A OH HELL YEAH!!!
Beyonce's body is ridiculous! So amazing
this isn't country music, just because you put a guitar in the the music doesn't make it country music
It sounds amazing!
I mean it’s good but I don’t understand , she gave other artists shit about doing country … but now she’s doing it 🤔 . Guess people shouldn’t be judged if you are to turn around and do the same thing .
The songs aight but this vid is still hoochie
No comment
Hot garbage 😅
This is awful 😖 please stop
This is horrible! At least put some clothes on, and stop using words that kids should not be using. Not country at all!
this is terrible.
😂😂😂 No😂😂😂
Definitely a line dance song😊
Love this!!!
I love it❤
WTF… why is this so good…. I fucking hate beyonces voice and music too.. i listened to this to be cringed by it..
Nope. Fail. I know the hive will worship their queen no matter what she says or does....but it's a no for me. If the music wasnt garbage , she wouldn't have to show up naked to sing it.
I love country😍❤️
Why do I like Beyoncé's  country music more than her other music? Lol I'm with this. 😊
…the country influence is lacking. More like gospel folk music (is that redundant?)
Not country
Definitely a Texas hold ‘em Stan ❤
It doesn't sound country..just like a pop song to me
Country isn't just a genre that can be appropriated... It's our culture! Where have I heard that before?🤔🤔🤔
I love it smmmm ❤❤ there’s a reason it’s doing so well
Go Houston girl!
I can see why Nashville is slow to play it!🤷🏾‍♀️
This is horrific. Stay in your own lane
This ain't country music ! This can't be through nashville
This comment section has to be bots…worst video ever….maybe modern day country? Cuz this is not country country….she at least could’ve thrown in some dancing instead of just pretending to shoot a gun…wtf is going on here 🤣
If someone is amgry at Beyonce for singing country music, we should pay close attention to who they are and the words they use to express their anger. Not one of those haters claimed that the music isn't good.
素晴らしすぎる．音が心地いい
❤
Umm, No!  Next
This is an absolutely incredible song. I never ever like female country vocalists, always way too high pitched and screechy, but Beyoncé’s exceptional!!!!!! Country music is hers for the taking if she wants it. Holy wow is she just insanely talented.
For all of you saying you're into country music now😂This is not fucking country music just cause you put a banjo in a song don't make it country gtfoh!!This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen🤦🏽‍♂️
Yessss beyyyyyyyy🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have a sudden urge to take the trash out
Sick shit!!
As far as the music is concerned it’s OK, Blues man Ray Charles added Country Music to his repertoire of genres he performed amongst a host of other musical forms.  However, the attire displayed at the beginning of the music is definitely in bad taste from my perspective: how many want to be Country artists have you seen dressed in such a provocative manner?  Most importantly, “What’s the intent? 😖       QUESTION EVERYTHING: What Is The Truth (WITT)???  🤨       GYHOOYA: OYE!!!  😤
I thought country music was bad. Now it’s crap.
Bots seem to really like this. I’ll pass though
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just no. You can't take your clothes off and call yourself a cowgirl...
Never been a fan of her and I enjoy country music over other genres... but this.... I really like this. Well done Beyonce.
If this radio station plays this song one more damn😡 time I’m gonna turn it up louder!
🤠🤠🌎🌍🌏❤️❤️
As a country fan ever since I was little I feel like this is a huge slap in the face to the country music world!!!! Other artists are coming over but they can! You have to know how to tell a story and this is just ridiculous! All these years she has been doing what she does now because more artists are doing some country and she sees the money flow  she wants in????🤣🤣 Don't t quit your day job!
Nah, that ain't country 🤣
Wow I  guess  you have to ear for her music because she can't sing.
I don't like it much, just one person's opinion.
Good for you trying  new things, but girl if you're going to honor us country folk please keep it classy. Clothes on and grt rid of the cussing.  Bless your heart.
I love this. I can't wait for more.
I love this. I can't wait for more.
One of the most cynical attempts at country, Good luck, my dear.
I wanted to give it a fair chance, but this is truly atrocious. 0/10
This is Horrible!!!!!
Not seeing what yall damn hyped about sounds like any other Beyonce song
Old enough that this new angle smacks of a tired old Madonna BS move. They could have done so much with this to give it a lift - the video is boring and does not reflect the song, the words or the genre at all. Not impressed.
Leave the country music alone, go back to singing satanic pop songs. This territory is not yours Beyonce.
This is a😂😂😂😂
I don’t like it
I'm all for artist experimenting with music, but this is not country. It's sung like gospel/church music, with country instrumental and pop lyrics.
Are you fking serious! Take it back to the ghetto!
Song sucks to me
This ain’t country.
❤ Texas Our Texas❤
Lol the only part of this song thats good is the chorus. No wonder as big as beyonce is this has 195k likes. I wish youtube showed dislikes still.
Good try but nah just stay in your lane Bey bey
Beyonce is so freaking smart she knows the real fans are in country music
It’s only number one because she is beyounce. It’s bad country
I'll say this is about as country as anything else on the country stations nowadays.
Not country. Southern pop
If you listen its really a gospel rhythm!
Lol
Listen I only listen to country and I love music such as Oliver Anthony zack Bryan and some others but this was wrote by chat gpt and is so stereotypical of country so no this song needs to be trashed she only made this to try and make money off the country market
The beat is country but the vocals are very much r&b
She need to leave it alone!
Nasty
OMG that's the worst song I've ever heard🤢🤮
Loved it so much
Lmfao 😅
This song sucks and its not authentic
Nope, this ain't it
Black population bout to experience what white folks went through with Garth!!!...and  I ain't even mad
Lmao 😂 keep the witches out of country music 🎶 country is for Christians not sinners
😂😂😂😂
She stole franklin thr turtle theme song. Lol
Amazing!!! And the video haha! Quite confused why it keeps repeating. Overall amayzingg
No thanks this sucks and she's dressed pretty trashy
Not country. She should stick with something else
Trash!
😂girl stop! I can’t quit laughing.  Go bk home to jz
Go Bey!!!!!
This really is the Franklin theme song!
No wonder the stations are refusing to play this trash.
Is she gonna be at coachella😍😍😍
Put some clothes on there is alot oof kids that like country plus that is not country
The worst song in history
Yall never sid nun when taylor swift changed from country to pop did yall??? Oh ok so stop hating beyonce ate ok
Much better I worry about the whole album .
Awesome song, well done! https://queenprincessnews.blogspot.com/2024/02/beyonce-az-essence-nek-pozolt.html #beyonce, #essence #familyphotossesion #newsmania #celebritygossips #hollywoodgossips #sztárpletyka
That is a joke right?  That won’t country. Stick to what you know lady. And the video is shit
omg, i love this so much!
Contrived
Why does it sound like it was recorded 20yrs ago though? Lol or under water. Sound quality is fuckin awful! 😂😂😂
Nothing country about this
You guys are still not fans of country.  You're just groupies
Might as well try to do a rock song then.
Our main stream media is senseless ethic less along with rising unemployment makes the migration of rural town tier 3 tier 2 cities   females & males migrate to metro cities where they act like animals those males who r sincere check the complete background of female  before getting married bcoz these days I have seen so many reports that males & females from  mostly in age 13 to 30 they just busy in taking gifts money food articles & physical intercourse only      no loyalty towards any one they change boyfrnds or partners like clothes so don't send males & females outside your area unless very necessary And get a female who as ur wife who has a character & loyalty Adultry has become a common phenomenon in India & Asia so talking about culture is waste marriage is no longer a pious thing it's just an agreement which legislature have to pass in UCC but females while making a boyfrnd live partner or getting married choose a wise prudent man not only Money & physical attraction that will lead to tarnish lives other Thing this generation have to understand the Loyalty is most important factor of Life.
This ain't a country song. It resembles what a pop kid thinks about country. The only reason it's on country stations is because winey bitches complained.
"Don't be a bitch come take it to the flo' now." 🔥
Great song !!! Good for u Lady B
trash
Thailand love you 🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤love this, k michelle been on country though.
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🤠🤠🤠
I dont like visual
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She's Beyonce. She can sing whatever she wants.
The song is good video not so much
usually i love her music i think my issue is i dont like country music she sounds great though
TEXAS!!
This song is growing on me. It's a Hell YES for me'!!
Beyhive forever ♥️
If you think this is a country music song your IQ hovers around room temperature 😂 she mentioned tornadoes and whiskey and you idiots really bought into it 😂
Country music has changed.
A black woman trying to be blonde, very boring song 😂
Ok so am I the only one that want to learn how to line dance to this??
The black origins of country music
Beyonce just blew country music the F **K up!!!!You go girl!!! LOl! I love it! And all those societal idiots who need something to complain about need to SHUT_UP!!
STR8 TRASH 🗑🗑🗑🗑
Love this   song beyonce  do ya thing    forget All the haters  ❤  sad what this world has came to   so much hatred    makes me sick
This could not be HER official video 😵‍💫
Good
Sounds like country music is getting desperate. Absolutely sucks.
I think this album will flop. It's not her genre. She's trying to cater to an audience who doesn't want her. But I admire her artistic creativity and risk taking like Rihanna's Anti, Jay-Z's 444, Kayne's Jesus is King, and Beyonce's 4 albums.
I like this song but Bey u get worse with each song and u look dumb
Nope!!
Heck No!!!!! Bad words!!!!! And nudity!!!!! I will never be a fan!!!!! Yuk!!!!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 3:38
This shit is awful 😂
What a joke
Shitt😂😂😂,,nkt,,,waste of time😂😂
Cowboy BeyPop
Love the song, Love this video, is this the final video ? if not , please do or release this video in full :-)
Great song, need a better video, its not about the song and theme
LOVE THIS SONG
Her vocals never miss
❤ love it ❤
I don't know whether to laugh or cry 😂
This is so cringe 😂😂😂😂😂
Sing Hay it's franklin instead hahah
I'm a fan of Beyonce music and I like country music but I'm not feeling this one.
This is unbearably awful.  just really, really awful, distasteful, vulgar - pretty much her normal but added a twang to it.
😂😂😂them people wild coz they all know where it all started from 👌🏽😂
Hear that tone-deaf commenters with useless opinions? Country has new Queen. Get over it.
In no way is this country music.
She low key trolling MAGA! And I’m here for it!!
Meh
Sounds R&B to me.
Yeehaa 🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇 🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Beyonce doing white music is absolutely crazy!
What are you all on because you need to share this is trash wtf even is this do you genuinely like this or is it because its Beyoncé like what the hell😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Look at one of our musical LEGENDS ( Beyonce ) 👏
kind
I LEAVE THESE
Trust
Country music without the stupid fake twang. I'm here for it.
“Hey it’s Franklin”
Feels almost strange to hear a country song with great, technically skilled vocals these days.😐 Chris Stapleton is the only big-time country artist I still listen to.  The song itself is cute enough, but is basically reliant of the charisma of Beyonce's voice to carry it off. In the hands of a mediocre vocalist, the song would be mid, imo.
I love country music I’m glad she bringing it back to its orgin
Dammit. Beyonce got me with this one and I'm not a country fan 🤠
mejor nadota 💤
Horrible!
Why is the.video so bland for such a fun song
Why does she have to dress like that. So inappropriate 😔
I like the song but the video is pretty stupid! It has nothing to do with the song. The video made me almost stop listening to the song.
Not a Beyoncé fan or a country fan, but I like this!
It would be great if she had on some more clothes on.
Heavenly father, please protect this queen!
She can do ANYTHING ❤
She is in a lane all bye herself
It was ours from the beginning anyway 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾😇
We can do it all lol it’s good 👍🏾
Love the song but why be practically naked? Sheesh.
Wow. This sucks. How much for 5 min bey?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I don't like it!
Супер! Бездоганно! Бейонсе - королева!!
Put some clothes on…….
Why is she making country music slutty?
Her boobs are mesmerizing !
🔫 🔫
I feel a line dance coming on
Real country girls dont dress slutty. Just because you put a hat on dont make you country
I've been leaning into country a 'little' bit these last 4-5 years. This is the BEST!!
Music style don’t belong to anyone. She can sing whatever she wants. Nice dancing song. Loved it
Stay & eat it’s plenty to drink as well.
True Queen! 👑 Love 💞
Keep your trash out of Nashville
Good work, Bey!  This vid is a bit redundant though.  No shade.
The original cowboys🤠 were Black Americans too. Research this…
Woah!!!!! Let me pick my jaw up off of the floo, ma'am!!!! Yeah haw!!! 😙🎵 Root'n toot'n!!! 💯❤️❣️❣️❤️❣️❤️❣️❤️
I love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is dope
I hope Beyoncé takes back Rock and Roll 🎸 too… ✊🏾🖤
Hate it! Why is she wearing a aluminum foil eye patch?  Never knew country folk dressed like they worked for the chicken ranch
Esperaba más movimiento en este video 😂 pero se repite lo mismo 😅
Can’t Wait Until Her And KMichelle Collaborate I Honestly Think She Should Do The Remix With Her And Megan Thee Stallion🎤🎙️🎼
the video is disgusting.  pretty privilege porn star world.
what's with the cheapo video? the song is just as basic and repetitive as thevideo. very simple and stupid sounding. might as well have sung Old Macdonald had a farm. E I E I O. reminds me of garth brooks when he went punk. bad move.
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared she stole Franklin the turtle theme music😂😂
I like that you do what you want!! ❤️  Keep making them mad! Virgo twin ♍️
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has simultaneously reached #1 on ALL major streaming services in the US(Spotify, Apple, Amazon)! 👑🐝
This is trash just like everything else that she sings pure trash
Dafuc.  B**ch you aint Taylor.  You cant cross over 2 genres.  😂
They never had house they still playing black old skool house
She put sum funk on that lame ass country shit.
Wtf 😂
At 1:39, I had to stop. Even by the shitty standards of  current country music, this is not it. You'll never catch me drinking whiskey and fucking around while listening to this. It is a song, but it is not good nor country. Also, what is up with the lame video?
Wow she really stretched her self out on this video…. NOT! Stick to what you know and leave country to actually country artists!
I love this!!
A master piece indeed ❤
Not looking much like a cow girl. Much more like an exotic dancer, and that’s the whole video? 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Her voice isn’t country. Song would be great sung by Miranda Lambert tho
Lmao
this is awful and country music is ruined
Absolutely 🚫
Great B! Pushing the boundaries, that’s what legends do. They call Elvis the King of Rock and Roll, but from before the 1920’s Black music was appropriated and ultimately credited to white musicians.  Whether you call it Blues, Rock, Country, R&B, Soul, almost all of it started out as a style of music played by Black American artists. Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, Lead Belly, Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Chuck Berry, Louis Armstrong, Aretha Franklin, Billie Holliday, Otis Redding, Ray Charles. Those are just some the musicians who created the styles of music we listen to even today. Even much of that music started out as Spirituals sung by slaves in the fields. That music inspired Buddy Holly, Elvis, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Clash, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Aerosmith, Justin Timberlake, Chris Stapleton, etc. That it is why it is great to see Beyoncé, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, Whitney Houston, Alecia Keys, etc. continue to expand on the massive influence that Black Americans have contributed to essentially every type of popular music we listen to in the US.
This shits 🗑️
Hmm…I like it! And I love the lyrics! Nicely done!
I guess she could just fart and everyone would praise her for being a genius. This song is sh*t
People like this cause it sounds like pop ,thats what she does
Garbage video garbage song.
Smuttin up country
This is not respectful country music at all ...could have been but ruined by the language and video
Man this song is pure 🔥  That hook is brilliant.  🙌🏻
This video is boring and lazy. She's had good music before. But! I don't know what this is. I thought you were supposed to go all out. when you cross over. TV show that you put in effort. I wish her well on her next album.
This ain't nothing but old school country music. Country music artist don't curse. She needs to leave it alone!
I hope it's cause she wants to and not bc country is trending.
This is awful
She took every cliche of country music and put it in a song. This is not a real country song 😂
the outfit is very revaling  i didn't even know you like country music, I LOVE THIS SONG PLS MAKE MORE COUNTRY MUSIC
Let me know when you make your first heavy metal album. This good though it’s nice and smooth❤❤❤
It isn't terrible but it is really not that good. Anyone should be able to make whatever music they want, but if you are going to be honest this song is below average.
Trush
You’re an idiot if you think this is country
Increíble temazo❤❤❤❤❤ lo adoro
🐢 got to love the Franklin reference
Where are her nipples? Looking like a barbie doll 😂
Take it to the floor seems like a twerk song.This is total disrespect to country music. To me country music tells a story, I can't  relate to this.
As a Okie and country, pop, hip-hop fan (shout out jellyroll and yelawolf) I really was expecting alot more from queen B..😑
This is a HIT!!  See u at the awards again for this song. ❤
Nope why
Nah this isn’t it
County music is one of the few genres that still use live acoustic instruments... great choice B
Eeeppp I do not like this
This song is fiiyyyyyyaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!
nope
Dolly Parton, The Best Little Wh-rehouse in Texas, betcha you dont mind Dolly half nekkid, let a grown Black Woman where whatever she wants.
Ya b gassing this jawn asssss
Wow .. if anyone comsiders this country music .. your vote should be automatically be voided
Wow, this ain’t her first rodeo. 🔥
The hell
i dont get it, why white folks think they created country music, why they so upset, mostly the republicans, 1 track brain
Dumpster fire
Bro the Houston Rodeo is next month stop acting like this isn’t normal & on perfect timing for us Texans 😂 they gone be playing this at the Rodeo everyday guaranteed 💯
I think she could do any genre because she is a great performer.but she needs to be true to herself. This song is not country. It sounds like it but it doesn’t make you feel something special in your soul like some country songs do. This sounds pop to me.I think she is the right talent but who ever her team is needs light years of inspiration. I’m also just starting to get into country music. 😢
Hahahahahaaaaaaaaa
Wtf is this shit
I'm going to have to hear this a few more hundred times...maybe it might grow on me. But something about it doesn't sound right.
Love country music & love Beyonce, but in my opinion, this doesn't even sound anything like country music, to me!!!
Sorry this isn't country music.
Am I the only one who needs a Kacey muscraves X Beyoncé song or what 👀
Who cares if it is country or not! At least it isn’t boring like most country songs are 😂😂😂
Not a big fan of country.  so does this cover both kinds? country and western and can i see it live at bobs country bunker,   sorry to  blues Brothers . Not seeing a problem here.  Except for the bigots
Bad outfit!
What does dressing like a whore have to do with country music ?
This is one of the dumbest videos I have ever seen her do… I thought it was gunna be like an authentic country music video nope… it’s literally just her half naked using her hand as a pretend gun.. so stupid to me 😖
🔥 🗑
Being an Okie. An Oklahoma native. I fkng love this Queen!!! Thank you!!!
Good to hear some positive music, but this is not real country. Good for her and her fans though.
Amo tu Bey 🇧🇷❤️
OMG I hold my tongue.  But the haters forget that Country music was made by the precursor of Blue and Bluegrass music from slavery and that is derived from music from the 1700’s and slaves.  They make me so mad.  You go QB.  They have to know went fold em’
😂 Someone needs to stop her. She copied the Franklin theme song 😂😂
Absolutely stupid and utterly ridiculous.
Deception...
She isn't feelin' it and neither do I😒
This is not real country. It's pop. Just because it has a western beat doesn't mean it's country.
This is still pop. Nothing country about it. And I can’t stand her.
Unpopular Opinions:  This song SUCKS.  Some artists can spread out from their main genre of music into others and it goes well.   This was just terrible.  She’s trying to hard to be country here. Some of the lyrics are old tired country lyrics I swear I heard in real country songs before.  It just didn’t have the same magic her songs usually do.  ❌❌❌❌
I love her
Why always fkn  half naked? Cant she sell with talent??  And we all know they get lipos every other week!
She isn’t a country artist. She is trying to be everything for everyone. This is an ok song but it’s wasted on Beyoncé. It’s like lil wayne releasing a rock album. Fake as shit.
Good job
Little weird, but I'm unopposed. I think the reason people are upset is because there is a cultural experience associated with the struggles that are generally the topic of country music. Same grievances are expressed when rich white kids from wealthy areas try rapping about things they have no experience of.
It's okay
❤❤❤❤
SHOW THEM BEYONCE
She’s flawless
I heard this caused a huge amount of #MAGAtears to flow!!!
🇧🇷❤
This is great, love it
Sucks
Love this! ❤
I love it!!
lmao..I see she brought her half naked clothing too...can u say DESPERATE? Nah..Not Country!
This reminds me of the American Dad episode where Roger makes a country song. Beyonce I can't believe I'm saying this but you don't have the soul for country.
Put some clothes on
Refreshing 😊
Obsessed with this song, can’t stop playing 😍
Weird
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:57 of a visual loop - Love it!
Not bad for her first country album
We created country music LET'S TAKE IT BACK ✊🏿
How can yall even put this a country music conversation
🖤🤠
Get it Bey! ❤ (The visual wasn't a wise PR move IMO. But it is what it is. It is her song. It is her brand. I just think it doesn't help when it comes to critics.)
Welcome to country , I love it !!
I actually like this song😂
LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!
What the actual hell is this video?!!  🤮  Does no one realize why it’s so repetitive in her motions, over and over - with one of her eyes covered?!   It does NOT get more demonic than music that comes with a pretty face.
Wow! 🤠❤️
I feel like saying this is country is a stretch, but she’s talented and did great as always
it's crap
This truly sucks! Dang
Please put on some clothes
No shame in clothes ppl
bixa eu pensei que não ia gostar e gostei eita como mamãe bey entrega y entrega
Not country to me sounds bullshit
Its a good song but there was no reason for her to dress like a stripper
She should not do country music.  This video is not what country music is!
❤❤❤
I love Beyoncé and I Love country music, so I love it!
AWEFUL, this ain't country doll face.  I do better
This sounds like she lifted the melody from John Mayer's song Wildflower!
Not a Beyoncé fan or a country music fan but  I like this song.
I love the song & I am a  HUGE COUNTRY MUSIC FAN!!!  Great, really great!!!!!
I don't know if she's taking over County Music.  But a good singer is a good singer regardless of the music style.  Just because she's black doesn't mean she can't sing County why people just want to put people in little boxes great fun songs  and great way to represent Texas.
This is the video? The same thing over and over??
Damn!
NO. NOT COUNTRY
Linda amiga obrigado pelas musicas lindas  que Deus te Abencoe sempre amiga Beyonce
It's ok nothing more and I'm a Beyonce fan
Just a singer with a little twang in the background attempting to make it a country song
All the amazing music this fabulous lady has made and we get this?  Didn’t Madonna do country way back in the 90s then Gaga try to have a go and flopped ? Why Beyoncé? Music needs a real injection of excitement , someone to reset and raise the bar, remind us there’s still great music to be made.but this? So bland . I expected much more from such a superstar. And such an awful cheap cover photo. Is this the image you’re putting out there for yours and our daughters to be like?
Long time Beyonce listener here. Look momma this was just terrible & lazy AF. Nowadays it seems male country singers really outnumber the girls. Not sure why this is. With that said, the country genre has had some of the best female vocalists in the music industry. So if you're gonna go w/this genre, you've really gotta bring it and you just didn't do that here. I heard a radio station had to have their arm twisted to even play this song in the first place and yeah, it was probably racism. But it's also true that this is just terrible. This is NOT an easy genre of music to sing and female country vocalists really tend to be top notch. In the pop & hip hop industry things are a lot more lax. Most vocalists in these industries are mediocre w/only a handful/small minority who are truly good vocalists. Doesn't mean that many of them aren't still enjoyable to listen to, but they're not what you reach for when you're in the mood for vocalists who can handle their business. Anywho please never try something like this again. I suppose the name of this song should also serve as a warning bcz it told me going in that this was gonna be a caricature of country while not hitting the mark. This turned out to be not just a caricature, a really atrocious one at that. A caricature wrapped in a really bad stereotype topped off w/mediocre vocals.  An absolute abortion.
It's good, but it aint real country music. As a born and raised Texan, this is more pop than country.
Not country
Keep this illuminati loving out of country....she comes out showing this crap
I love the song. But this video is ugly!
Comentário Brasileiro aqui Brazil here ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
🤮
Minha irmã eu vim assistir achando que é um clipe e a senhora só com esse pombão pra trás e pra frente com o dedo pegando fogo. Fiquei dois minutos esperando a senhora sair disso e nada. Depois escuto a música com calma no fone. É melhor.
Awful 0:29
She looks good
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS HAPPY SONG!!!! MAKES ME JIGGLE MY BONES!!!!!!!!! & DANCE AWAY!!!🎶🎼❤❤️
I like it
This ain’t country she put on a hat and thought 🤣🤣🤣
This is garbage. She ain’t country so she needs to just sit in the truck and don’t touch any buttons.
Yikes. Horrible song no matter what genre 😅
Nothing it's not really a good one for her but there is Rucker he is a good one for country he can sing his Rock and plus he can sing country really good I have nothing against her but it's just not good for her her other songs are better that she sings
Worst fucking song ever
I love this somg!
She did that 👌 💯
Queen B HLOQLDLG HACE LO QUE LE DA LA GANA. Good for her.
This is pop, not country. But then again country has not been country for a long time aside from a few select artists. So she will do good in the genre. lol
The queen of country music
Yea no stay with what you got now no need to try an ruin something that's already good and this is coming from somome that Is married to real country woman
Wow she still looks good and she's got a voice of gold. ❤
I'm here for dem TITTIES!!!!!!
WE’RE TAKING BACK THE BORDER WITH THIS ONE ☝️🔥🗣️
It's not country music I agree
I like the song. But she could've done better with her video. Her boobs? What about showing black women riding barrels, black people training horses, & black bull & bronc riding. You don't think Black people know & love horses? Think again!
Sucks
Fantastic video LOL
Y'all the two step/ line dance that's about to come out to this is going to be EPIC!
She should make a remix with Megan thee stallion ❤
Ok new genre unlocked R&C!!!
This is the first Beyoncé song I've ever liked 💕
This sucks as a country song, a bunch of sheep following everything Beyonce and Jay do
I think Country Music sucks... with and without Beyoncé... sorry!!   Carrie Underwood sucks too...
OK, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING TO WOMEN AND ME. THIS NOT COUNTRY STYLE. TO NASTY HO.
There are a lot of black country singers but this NO 😂
Lmao....please tell me this trash is a joke😂
As a black person who is a honeybee I approve
So because she's not a country singer some people don't like her singing country well would you eat the same meal because of your race you going to have sex the same position everytime you going to wear the same clothes everyday come on people that's living under that so called Genre light. I like her song❤
this music sounds like one of his old grown women songs, I don't think some people know ,love ❤let a like if you know what I’m talking about ❤️❤️
She is whhouatier dan me
What a joke! She's a 🤡
This is a great song! It's so fun and catchy.
AWESOME  BEYONCE SHE  CAN SING ANYTHING WE LOVE IT
Not sure its just racism. Could it also be the presentation,.  Crossing over in a genre like country music nude might not be well received. It should be more about vocals not so much boodie;  people still have values, even if you believe you are a top pop artist.
Good Lord this is terrible
Searching for that album if the year🙄
Iam not a fan of her music but i love this song
The voice is great, the song is just okay but the "visualizer" is just another woman marketing herself as a sexual fantasy.  Ugh.
THAT SHOW Franklin the Turtle needs to be revived!
🤠  Well Sugar Me Country......  ::She 'is' from Texas:: 😉   ::Representing her own state ⭐
GARBAGE 1000%
This song is bringing so good mood! Thank you Beyoncé! You are brightening up my days when I am listening to this song! 🫶🤠
Not a country fan but as a houstonian I loveeee this 💕💕 it doesn’t have that annoying twang most country has
Cowgirl Bey ❤️
Shits trash 😂😂😂😂
Nah. 😢Please stay with what your good at.
Omgg im a huge fan i went to ur Concert in the Netherlands I would appreciate it if you maybe could look or maybe comment on one of my edits of you i love your music soo much Xx Olivia
this is an unexpectedly repetitious visual
Alright Mrs. Carter, great country song. Wear the cowboy hat and boots to represent the real cowboys who were Blk. Janet Jackson did the Black Cat to hint who created Rock-n-Roll. America was not woke at the time, so we need a Rock-n-Roll piece from you. Bring all music genres back to their roots.
dont let u fuck up by this satans😡
This isn’t country. More like bluegrass/Americana. Interesting though.
Fabulous. Beyonce shows us how it is done!
I'm a ol'country girl from Clarksville to Nashville I love this. We started country music and I like how we going back to our roots. Yesss Bey
I love this and you
Love the song.  Not the video.
hmmm, bringing ratchet "don't be a #%$#%" lyrics to country - lame
🎉
I think Beyonce has different muscles in her left fingers, because I can't make that pistal formation and maintain it without fidgeting. Way to go Gurl.
I don't like it.  It leaves me cold.
That ain’t Country.
Well, its not a total dumpster fire. This not a good song. Its meh, at most
I positive love it
I'm not a fan of Beyoncé, but this country song is different and expands her range into a different genre. Good job.
Yeah....nah
This 😂😂song sux
😮 So this is how blacks are going to represent in country? There were more pastors than panhandlers and more virgin brides than prostitutes… Not ancestor approved!
This nice! It's definitely pop....
Does she have to be naked for everything???? Good grief!!!
Not sure if she trying to do country or  Onlyfans ... not really country music so, narrowing it down...
This is ass Bruh 😂
Fire
Elvis did it... Beyonce  Reclaim  Remix🎉 Love it🎶🤠
I don't see this as country, as much as I see it as "sampling." It is indeed brilliant. I would expect nothing less from her.
🤠 🎶✔️❣️😎🥳
🙋🏾‍♀️❣️
This song sure has the Dookie of Hazzard in a white supremist tizzy!
I was never a fan of Beyonce old country music as a rule.. but I kind of like this song and the fact that it drives country music loving people and the people on the right crazy is just an added bonus. You go B!!! I may listen to some of her music
ɢʀᴇᴀᴛ❤❤❤❤
This music for me  ❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is the Destiny's Child on back up vocals?  Oh thats right, she left them.. i love country singers, like Reba, loretta, Dolly, not this Shit!  No heart in it. It sucks.  Catchy tunes good
Love it, Love it, LOVE IT!! Wake up country music cause there's A NEW SHERRIFF IN TOWN!!
This is garbage and everybody on the internet knows it. Stop the only reason why you are like. This song is because she's naked. It is obvious she has her t****** done.
🔥🔥🔥
Gah! So fantastic!
I feel she could do country music wonderfully. She has so much soul and talent, but this song is flat to me and almost zero emotions.
Nice outfit Beyonce is always queen fashion ⭐⭐⭐⭐❤️❤️❤️
This is just another beyonce song, once you've heard one you've heard them all. It's a very basic beat and melody that they tried to pass as country, but the same simpletons who can't see the living, walking contradiction that is beyonce will applaud this too.
Well I love Queen 🐝 but I mean I know that she's from Texas and all but this is a rookie attempt at country only because she doesn't have a country singing voice, she may still sound that way when she talks but not as she's singing. The music fits the bill and I'm not being mean just honest. This and a lot of music genres come from us and they were stolen from us and copied in their own way like Elvis's You ain't nothing but a hound dog, that sist'a only got $500. for that song.
👑
It's a good song and I haven't listened to Beyonce and a very long time I really like this song
not really into Beyonce or todays style of country music but .this song has made me sit up and listen ❤❤❤
This shit ass
Pass on this crap 😂😂😂
What is this utter utter garbage 🗑 😂😂😂
This video is just repeating itself. I don't get it.
Hopefully she has a soulful sad country song
😅😅 I love that Texas song that's the number one song you should win the reward with that song country song keep it 100 Beyonce❤😊❤😊❤😊
Dang it girl, I love that tune. It's catchy, makes you want to move! Hope there is more to come!
Gone piss on them 🤣
This is wayyyy too good urgghh❤
The cheepest music video ever made. Tits? Good. Moving on.
Queen did this !!!!
Great song and I don't even like country.   What I love the most is how MAD everyone seems to be.   Everything this woman does is GOLD! Stay mad bitches! Ima go learn line dancing.
This is far far better than anything else she's done yeehaw girl
This ain't country. Plus don't try and bring degeneracy to country music.
I don't understand why people are mad at this? This is a really good song and it fits the newer meaning of what the country genre is. And her voice is flawless, as usual.
I don't like it.
So park you're lexus and stay around. 😆 🤣 😂  not country at all.
No Beyoncé!!!  Do another one
Is it just me or did I hear blue ivy say “ pink boots “ at the end 3:28, THAT SOUNDED LIKE ONE OF HER CHILDREN
This is cultural appropriation
I love it💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼🔥🔥
I love the Franklin theme song!
Wack
This ain’t Texas ain’t no hold em 🎉❤
It’s great she’s trying other genres. Just wish her vocals sounded country not just the instrumental.. and the song sucks
GALOPEIRAAAAAA!!!!! THE GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!! BRAZIL LOVES U, QUEEN!!
This is not country at all Jesus it’s bad
I've never been into country. Thts not about to change after hearing this.
This isnt country, not really...  But its not bad neither,
Sorry but it’s not a good song 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yesssss!!! Beyoncé love it 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻❤❤❤
song is very well done. the outfit not so good.
So she wants to go from gangsta to cowgirl ? Not buying it
I listened to her first song that I seen and came here to listen to this song. I loved the first song that's why I wanted to listen to this song. Reading comments really makes me sick, I don't know why everything has to go to a race battle.  There have been so many different races throughout history enjoying each other's customs and traditions. Can't people just enjoy something without having to make it ugly? SMDH
This shit is whack
Trashy
This is soooo bad 😂
I don't like the video I really don't need to see her half dress doing nothing
Yeah, stop this isn’t country. People are only praising this cause of who Beyoncé is and don’t want to discredit her but let’s be real this is regular r&b with computerized banjo
Hey it’s Franklin theme song
I’m gonna say it. It’s awful. 👎
YASSSS BEYONCÉ LOVE THIS JAM!!!!! I wish this video was more to it,, however ur queen B!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥂🥂🥂🤠🤠🤠🤠
MY NEW FAVORITE SONG.........!!!!!!
LOVE......IT.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nope
❤❤
Remember when Shania Twain showing off her mid drift was scandalous? 😳
sounds just like country to me, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Crystal Gayle Dolly. sounds just like country. She’s even dressing the same way they did………wth
This is not country ...or represent country ..she did this for the race card
What a great mom and Christian ✝️
This is hilarious 🤣.  She sucks at any genre she sings
Cultural appropriation at its worst
It's a pretty good Tune. I would love to see this performed Live, Acoustically. No loops or prerecorded music. just instruments and mics.
not country. Susks.
Wait a minute...this ain't the video! Is she not gonna do videos any more?
Bless. This is about as country as Kylie Minogue's "Dancing"
Definitely a pop song not country and if you say otherwise your the problem with what “country music” has become today
She needs to show more books and booty
Lol I don’t think it’s bad.. it’s actually good & better than the Caucasian colonizer music..their origins started in the caves of mountains..they are not indigenous to this land..go off Beyoncé make then turn red like the devils they are
RHIANNON. GIDDENS.
This is going to be a movement, blacks in country music
Why don't you learn something from your sister it's called individuality and learn to be your self. Stop copying other people you could never be chapel heart you could never be a cowgirl, you're a privilege stinky billionaires that nobody really cares to hear from anymore, why don't you go serve the poor go feed the homeless go do something with yourself and get out of our face! You're not Solange!
RNB Pop vocals slapped on a Country background.. This aint it.
dam wtf is this i want to run n scream. she needs to stick to pop
Need to upload the line dance to it.
YEEEE HAAAAAW!
Influencia mexicana claramente 🌵🌵🌵CACTUS 🌵 🌵 🌵  BELIDAPOP #Belifans
The amount of people this song will piss off is just an added bonus to how fantastic it is! 😁
Look at me loving country music!! Go Beyoncé!! 😂😂👏🏽👏🏽🇺🇸
That's some two step; swap sweat; line kick and turn.  Maybe a slide er two. Tune for a Friday .    Yeah.
Hate it all you want, but don't act like this is worse than the garbage they've been passing off as "country music" for years.
Is this the only video to this?
I'm no prude! Bad costume choice for a country audience. Most are church going christians.Song is wonderful.
Hey it’s Franklin!
Whatever it is its NOT country😂😂🤮🤮🤮
Not a bad song but if it’s ment to be a country song it’s very bad
I’m not a fan of hers, but she not doing anything wrong. Get your money boo, if you can do it, do it. Keep on shining hunny
https://youtu.be/SqCLSx9y_I0?si=Y8oI7H8n8grU98IJ
MY GOODNESS ❤
Obscene lyrics & the same shot over & over. What a waste.
Only here after the video stating the instrumental is from the kids show Franklin.
Ya'll gotta give Hit-Boy credit too.  Hit-Boy been producing nothing but classics and it's been nothing but statements being made.  Real Music 💯💎
Suddenly I like country music!
🤮🤣 Girl please stop! This is not country!! Stop being greedy and stick to what you know.
There is absolutely no reason to dress the way she does to sell her songs.
Masterpiece
Song feels hopeful ❤
Leave country to real country singers not wannabe's
really cool song Beyonce
she made country tolerable
Yes, banjos are from Africa!!
Put some clothes on
Country overlaps with gospel. Aretha had an Allman Brother on her album.
❤❤❤❤❤
Beyoncè is a real life Barbie doing every damn thing and you either love it or hate it. When she opens a vet clinic and an airline ya’ll know you’ll be in line 😂 because it’ll be great!
Nice song
😂
Wars Fade Memories Don't
Holy crap! She’s still wearing that same dress!? Her fashion sense is just as awful as her so-called country music! 😆
let her put Dolly Parton on here its game over trust me!!! I can hear it already.
Sounds like the opening of the kids show “Franklin” 👀
I get what she's trying to do...reclaiming country music and whatnot, but this has little country vibe to it and her sound is very pop r&b,...and there's nothing wrong with that, at all, let's not call it something it's not though. This song isn't country...let alone the video....the video is anything but. Not being a hater because I love Beyonce, just saying what alot of people are afraid to due to being deemed politically incorrect.
I like it! Beyonce has busted the lid off of the country scene. She's got album of the year in RANGE! Watch y'all!
its not country music.  its soft porn.
Pathetic excuse for music.
I cant wait to learn the line dance to this!
Was curious to hear it but damn the songs horrible.  For an official video this looks like crap.
Well, that is awful.
There are a couple songs I like just fine........ she largely missed the point of Country but then again 99% of modern "Country" musicians miss the point so i can't really hold it against her....... that said I do actually kind of like this song.
It’s one of those songs that’s just annoying nah So far I’m not liking her county stuff
Put a damn shirt on. Nasty.
This could possibly become the biggest single she has ever released
This is bloody brilliant
nope. nope. nope. not a fan.
As much as I like this song I agree with the critics that this isn't country music. It has a country sound just like Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road'. Hell he even had a true country singer on the track with him, Billy Ray Cyrus. But it's not country music. These songs are not in the country genre. It's just pop music and pop music includes many different genres within it. But it's not a country song ya'll. You can't just play the banjo and throw on a cowboy hat, make a track then call it country. Stay in your lane Bey!! Plz don't switch it up! But I guess billionaires do what they want to. This is coming from a black man that lives in TN and Gd up from tha feet up✡💪🏾
This this visualizar is pissing me offfff 😂😂😂
I like the song but it doesn't sound like a country song at all lol just a little twangy pop song
Good song and I’m not a Beyonce or country music fan. It’s very catchy
All I have to say is yeehaw baby!!!! Love this song!!! ❤
Salute to you Beyonce for breaking  barriers and looking  just as beautiful as always. But can we get a video with you in some Daisy Duke.😊😅😊❤
I'd fire everyone who worked on this song. The lyrics are just trying to fit every Country cliche into one, lay it on a twangy instrumental and try to pass off as "Country". RnB vocals on a country-inspired pop beat.
Sorry not a country song. Just because she put a banjo and fiddle in the arrangement does not make it country.  Maybe she should talk to Darius Rucker on how to make a real country song. He made the switch successfully.
Absolute trash from billionaire globalists…
Guys this is not country music this is pop with a country beat❤ it
Way better than Jason Aldean's try that in a small town by far.
this is a bop bey!!
Love the song but her wardrobe is abit 🫣
Love the song, hate the lack of clothes. As a Texan and a lover of all music genres. I have absolutely no issues with Beyonce and her talent for making music across all of these different groups. I think she would catch more respect with a shirt though. Sorry just my opinion.  I wish her nothing but love and success in all of her endeavors.
Yeah I think I just don’t like country. This beat/composition sounds so incredibly basic. Like “Fisher Price: My First Country Beat.” But if you don’t like it because it’s Beyonce or some other racist shit, please do not agree with me. This is country. Beyonce is a great talent. I just think this is whack.
I don't even really listen to secular music but when they said it sounded like Franklin one of the kids favorite cartoons I had to check it out. And I'll be doggone it if it don't! Jay Z and Beyonce will definitely take an old school and make it a new school in a hot minute won't they!?😂❤ I like the tune
Song not my cup of tea I wouldn't buy it but she is a legend
One day, skin colour, gender and sexual orientation will be as unimportant as hair or eye colour, and we can stop making a big deal about them. Only then will he have achieved equality, I look forward to that day.
How many underage girls have given birth to Jay-Z's children?
Love it!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
nope
Was the open bust necessary for that kind of music?
I’m not a Beyoncé fan but I actually like that she’s singing country.  She has a great voice for it too.  It doesn’t sound too wild and sounds like she’s really showcasing a subtle side of her.
PAN 🐐
Iconic.
Love it ❤
Didn’t Avicii do this? 11 years ago? Wake Me Up.
What a dumb video -_-
Freedmen/Foundation Black Americans always been singing country music, always remember our Freedmen/FBA’s ancestors was the entire entertainment for the system of white supremacy doing their enslavement for centuries, not just picking cotton, Freedmen/FBA’s ancestors made instruments, used their voices as instruments, sung songs in brutal enslavement conditions. The system of white supremacist entertainment industry put labels on things they did/do not create, so first they can demean Freedmen/FBA culture so they can steal it, wanting FBA’s to abandon a particular genre so they can take over it, remember Jazz, R&B, Disco and Hip Hop, how the system of white supremacist hated it. It is a Freedmen/Foundation Black American woman name Linda Martell she’s a country singer in the 1960’s, King George is a country singer, Khia is a country singer and rapper, Jeter Jones he’s a country singer !!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Beyoncé country song it is the ISH !!!!!!!!!!!!
Not county's music at all. If you want country listen to cody jinks.
sound so damn good Music with soul❤
Hey its Franklin.  Coming over to playyyy
Looks like me learning to square dance in elementary school wasn't a complete waste of time huh 😂
I love country music, and I'm leaning towards giving this a little chance.   The video itself I'm not too fond of. If she's trying to foot herself into the genre, I'd say give it some country flare
This isn't country.  This is really bad.  it probably needs its own genre name.   Maybe "Rbountry."    R&B Country
Just because u put a country beat over your non country sounding voice doesn't make it country
Jura?
K Michelle went country first though and no one is giving her credit… smh  All about the culture but only when it’s B?
Tf is this trash lmao
This is going to spin up the haters. 😂
Nope, always boobs out 0 class
It’s crap, just same r&b with some whoops and banjo plucking..what  a joke
Clothes?

I'm not normally into country music but decided to take a listen after seeing all the uproar about country music stations not playing it. I like it!!
Absolutely love this country song ❤
So we just gonna ignore the fact this is the Franklin cartoon theme music just sped up lol ..... Straight up
I think this is good country and for those scared of new perspectives,  you will never grow in as a person. What paranoid people will do is unreal!
I'm sorry but this song is not country music and it's not REAL country and she's also a devilWorshipper. she even claimed herself as Sasha as a goddess at the super bowl years ago and she's demon possessed.I've never cared for her music, but I pray that Lord save her and her families soul.
Not country
Queen 👑 of Country!!!!
The euro-American racists are so PREDICTABLE 😂
This is literally the most tolerable country song I've ever heard.
Just cause you throw Texas in a song don't mean it's country, please go sit down 👎
Linda!!!
Nice!!
This is not traditional country music frist off all I'm old enough to remember when female entertainer 's were known for there God given talent there natural voice skills  ella fitzgerald/miss Sarah Vaughn/ Abby Lincoln/Nancy  Wilson /Dinah Washington  on and on  but now they come out before a word comes out  naked dam near nothing on as a man I ain't thinking about her voice she's intentionally shifted the  narrative my mind is no longer on her voice it's become sex driven the word wholesome no longer exist this is an insult to American country music black or white truth be told by the way I'm as black as it get born bread north Philadelphia pa 1949
Okay, you have my attention. 😍
I'm loving the tune. I'm line dancing already!❤ 💃 🕺
Why is the video so boring tho
Trying to be the face of Country now is juat fucking ANNOYING
People forget Beyonce is from Texas and she loves Rodeos and Country!
Illuminate
Esse é o grande mousse que tanto enfatizam? 😂
Swiftly coming!
This Fri all platforms infinite IAM music even Spotify bit I'm on Spotify now lol
Song and video suck! She can't seem to make a video without looking trashy!
I feel like an entire album of weapons grade Nashville crafted bachelorette party anthems is about to be deployed on the US like a bio weapon.
Cmon wtf she wearing? Can she do anything without looking trashy? Anything at all???
The words " bitch" and " shit" , the naked,  sexually suggestive video, yeah I can see country music , taking issue with that.
This video sucks, surprising from her 😮
This is absolute trash.  You think you just add some banjos and its country? What a disgrace.. Go back to your urban pop crap and stay in your corner.
This isn't country 😂 Dope song though lol
Beyoncé getting a reality check lol
It's not bad tbh..not bad at all
I'd rather listen to 20 cats cough up hairballs. This is trash
Sexy Country music...
THE BEE HAS STRUCK AGAIN!!!
Spent lots of money With the video 😂😂😂😂
Elle c'est pas fouler pour la chorégraphie 😂 sinon le sons et bien
This sounds boring. This is not BEYONCE GRADE AAA. 😢
Videos dead tho.. even the song tbh.
SOUNDS KIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT 🤦
I'M  NOT A BEYONCE  FAN I LOVE OLD SCHOOL  MUSIC , WHITNEY,  CHAKA, GLADYS  , PRINCE , MICHAEL  ECT. ECT.    ....... I LIKE THE BEAT AND BANJO IN THIS SONG , SOUNDS GREAT , BUT HER SINGING HAS TOO MUCH ALTO AND NOT ENOUGH COUNTRY , TOO URBAN ......😊😊😊
Money should never be worth more than your soul       Jay z spoke at the Grammy and for me it was a turn off and so narcissistic it's like did you forget why your in entertainment? Use to be for the love. now shit water down with ego
This is a cover, not her song
I don’t know why people saying it’s bad it’s not that bad
Beyonce is trying to win some of the fans of Taylor Swift
She definitely ain't country
Nasty outfit
Queen B trying to capture the Cowboys nation and trying to be a White person..... I can't 😂
Umm… it was ours to begin with so… 🤷🏽‍♀️
QUEEN
Garbage.
Nope. This aint it.
I'm am here for all of it!
Ahahahahah lame
Anybody who grows up in Texas has the country sound in their heart.
Man! She's looking Full Throttle!
This is a joke right!?!
This is awful!!!🤣🤣💀🤣
What's up with them fake ass ta tas spread tooo far apart?
Lame.
wow, sex...what kind of an outfit is that??
Whoa......don't put Bey in a box!!I'm trying to take it to the floor,girl!!
Not a fan
She's officially out of ideas.
She's not a Country Music singer. Go back to Hip Hop in your Lexus.
Horrible…
I’m gonna love this album
B getting old. Time she acts her age. For her kids sake. She makes women with close on a limited quality.
*Reclaiming our ROCK next 😋❣️*
Trash!!!!!!!!
I would love to hear Beyonce and Adele on a track
"Hey its Franklin. Comin over to playyy"😊
😂😂😂
I hope Billy Ray Cyrus jump on the remix and really piss off y’all haters. We invented this ish.
Hey, it’s Franklin 🎶 🐢 All I hear hahahaha!
why she calling tha bros a 'bitch' tho?? 😭 chill
This is the strangest video I’ve ever watched.
I hate country all my life and I hate this more than traditionally country. This sounds like my children’s nursery rhymes.
This too much Beyonce
Why does everything have to have sex and nudity in it? Is there nothing else in the world?
The anti gun mob will be shitting bricks
I'm sorry but not but this is not country music and the word bitch is never in any country music song I've ever heard .
Beautiful!
This is absolutely the most lackluster song, and video, that I believe I have ever seen.
A big fat EWWWWWW. NO for me
I don’t care 4 the politics of the country right now and the music biz currently about Beyonce doing country. All I no is I really like this song and I think its deeper than most can comprehend but even just on the sub service this record slaps. All those small bars across the Midwest where the cowboys and Cowgirls hang out. Just no those jukeboxes will be playing this record on repeat. Trust n believe.   Good music is just that Good music  Love to all humanity across this Country. God bless America and her people.  JL
Disgusting entry. It’s not a strip show!!! This ain’t country music. Just another singer with a failing career jumping on the country music bandwagon.
Put some cloths on and act like a lady. Respect yourself! Call Lainey or just stay in your lane.
This sounds like a big, steaming pile of dog💩!!  🤢🤮
What's funny is that while all these people run around saying Beyonce doesn't belong in country, she's releasing music that sounds more like actual raw country music than 2/3 of the shit that gets passed as country music these days. I'm here for this
Ive heard some bad wanna be country songs …. This is up there near the top.
👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️🎶 #iheart #iheartcountry
I've never been a Bey fan. I like a few songs of hers. I'm adding this one to that list. It's catchy. I like it. I want a line dance for it.
Yeeeeeha c'mon cowboy!!! 🤠
She is one of the best artists of my time. However, this is NOT country music!
It is Sickening !!!   This Ain’t Country and she’s more than 1/2 naked I don’t blame the County Radio Stations for Not Playing it !   She needs to go back home .
😍
I like the song but it's not country
dont do this anymore beyonce
Okay now I understand why she wore what she wore to the Grammys. It was an Easter egg clue
GET DOWN..... BLACK AMERICAN MUSIC..... CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN YOUR FACE ..... KNOW YOUR HISTORY......
this is awful
Na this shit is mot County. You mean she sold he soul to the devil and came out with this? Gtfoh, you ain't County you just a rich, soul selling, celeb!
Bey letting others know she can do something they cant.. nikki cardi cant lay down country tracks.. i dont even think meg can lace one. Bey on top..
This song has a feel of old soulful country music . This song is good !!!!!!! Idc idc she ate this ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The only reason 'What You Get...' wasn't categorized as a country song, when Tina Turner (her record co) released it, back in the 80s, ..is the issue of Ms. Turner's race. I've read it described as "country-flavored" or "tinged" or some other nonsense, as if the critic was doing Ms. Turner a kindness - utter BS! You've got to be hearing-impaired or dead not to hear and know what kind of music, TT was performing in 'What You Get...'. If Dolly Pardon [Love Dolly Pardon...nothing against her.] or some other white country music artist had performed 'What You Get...', without changing a single chord, it would have been billed 'country music', and how well or poorly it performed would have been its own consideration. Irrespective of how entertaining her two NEW songs are, it's a similarly motivated cultural quirk that now follows Beyonce's foray into country music. If we're being fair [Ha!], ..the only issue or question we should have with 'Texas Hold'em', after acknowledging its country music DNA, is - is the damn thing any good? Is it your cup of tea? 🤠 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0GVixJvt-g
Remember when Beyoncé wore decent clothes and went to church fighting temptations style? Put some clothes on. You’re a mother for goodness sake.
Awful! No way!!! Hard pass. This is not country at all and she needs to put on some clothes. 👎🤮
garbage
Bey  , this is  🔥🔥🔥🔥💃🏿🕺🏿💃🏿🕺🏿💃🏿🕺🏿Love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥 🕺🏿💃🏿🕺🏿💃🏿🕺🏿🎊🎉🎊🎉
Don't b a b...come take it to the floor now..love my girl😂😂❤❤
Hey let me get my cowboy boots out heyyyyy
That's not country that's hipster from 2012 lol  The "ho's" and "heys" are straight from the lumineers from the 2010s  Beyonce has so many catchy songs in different genres  This just seems like a cash grab.  She could have reached out to get a better producer on this song bc this ain't it
To those hatin', shutcho mouf, put yer drink down get up and start line dancin' ya varmint...
Ew
Now get Andre 3000 to feature with his flute. Hope you guys see whats happening.  Claim it back!
Always fight off liking Beyonce but now have to come to Reality , Cant help but let my guard down and confess,  I love Bey, She is Brave and Super Talented    She got the Midas Touch
Trash
Man this song is FIRE!!! This is what COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO BE,  before White people stole it.
One of the worst songs I have ever heard
Beyonce needs to find herself without Jay- Z. So many bad vibration about this.
I love it!! Great job. Better then most of them in my opinion
Great song video 😮 can you put your top on plz😅
So generic 😢
Does she have to be naked in everything
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
She also should thank Charlie Pride, without him African Americans and Country Music would be even more relegated and subjected to little to no airplay.
Wow this is such a train wreck, and R&B singer doing country. Or what she thinks is country. Which sounds a lot like the Pitbull and Kesha track. This is just plain terrible and it shows proof that Beyonce has a serious issue with anyone attempting to be a bigger star than her. Once Taylor Swift started overshadow her. She had to try to compete with it. Beyonce's never showing an interest in country music or even gospel music for that matter. Which is where a lot of country music is based in. So I can only surmise that this is her having a pissing fit with the fact that Taylor Swift is currently a little more famous and in the spotlight and she is. The lyrics to the song are stupid and make absolutely no sense there's no story being told. And other than the fact that there is a synthesized banjo and dobro. That's the only thing that even makes this reminiscent of country
Maybe of she covered herself up she would be taken more seriously..
what 💀
This is what yall have been calling ....stealing someones elses roots she is NOT COUNTRY STAY IN YOUR OWN LANE WHAT TAYLOR SWIFT SHUT YOU DOWN SO YOU HAVE TO GO COUNTRY? WELL JUST REMEMBER SGE SET RECORDS THERE FIRST TAYLOR SWIFT STILL IS SOOOO MUCH BETTER YOU CANT EVEN GET PEOPLE TO BUY YOUR ALBUM SO YOU CAN WIN ALBUM OF THE YEAR BUT JUST LIKE YOUR  FANS YOUR CHEAP , CHEAP AND CANT SING EVERYTHING GREAT THIS SUCKS
Not going to lie, I really dislike this. It's a snooze fest
That's a bad chick!!!!!!!!!!! Go B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Damn!!!!!!!
Queen of country
I’m not feeling it I’ll rather hear k Michelle country music than this
Yoo I’m not gonna lie this joint fire I’m now a country fan bout time the drill music getting drowned out by REAL MUSIC TGOD FOR YONCE
Absolutely not crazy about this at all.
I love the song!! But is this all there is to the Video? Just one shot and put it on loop🙄
Beyonce the queen of Music you are!
Queen Beyoncé is an icon.
I hope the outro has its own song.
Buena música nada que ver el contenido del video que necesidad de enseñar casi todo
Beyoncé doing Beyoncé things.
If I want to listen to a country song, it won't be by Beyonce. The only reason she's doing a country tune is because Country and Rock are up on the streaming charts. R&B and hiphop are down more than 40% in popularity on all streaming sites. It's all about $$ for Beyonce.
🤣🤣🤣🤣she just did one thing the whole video
In love with her voice till eternity 💕
This is not country. Bye Beyonce.
This is cultural appropriation at is's finest, shamefull
John Shenider doesn't like her. She needs to be white. We apparently need to be told what to listen to based on sex and race when it comes to Country music. Country equals white. Rap equals white.bluegrass equals white. Hey why don't we just make everything white,then everything will be ok . Give it to them..like what is the point in having anything when it gets taken and then thrown back in your face.
trash
1- weirdest repetitive video   2-cultural appropriation. Oh wait, that only applies to some people.
Beiadeira🤠
I normally can’t listen to much country it’s boring but I like the sound she adds to it makes it digestible lol.
💙💙💙
This is amazing. Going to listen the hell out of it while I work my horses and ride out❤
Vulgar. Boring, repetitive Visualizer
Love it. The video so good.
This shit is trash...gtfoh
She is so fowl and desperate.She ain’t no country chick.
I don't know how many people are close to my age that would remember the show Urban Cowboy back in the late seventies early eighties there's a bunch of real estate problems and stuff going on so Urban Cowboy came out and made they had the club called Gilley's there in Houston and you know now this here will bring back all the Western apparel all the stuff that was going on back then it's just like we live in 30 plus years later I guess but I definitely love it and I love Beyonce, the real estate market is now in certain areas areas it's real bad but in others you know it's doing better is this a lot of similarities to this as it was then I believe wholeheartedly from shows movies more videos that a lot of things can be turned around just because it has Beyonce in it
One word I can think of she's just beautiful
Country music was already ruined with all these new artists and of course Beyoncé had to officially destroy it.  Let’s go back to the 90s and early 00s and stay there.
She is too trashy
Yup, pretty much the shit show I was expecting...
AI does wonders!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope AI gets it's money for generating FAKE MUSIC!!!!! No country sound at ALL!!!!
Not country. Not good. Put some clothes on. Again. Not country.
I don’t like this cultural appropriation. Vultures will not be tolerated. #cancelQueenB
Wooooah horsey! Just no! Stick to ya path kid, stick to your path.  This actually hurt my already damaged heart. I feel I need to apologize to my ear canals for the eustachian trauma. This is all kinds of wrong. Good pistol blower and good attempt at cosplay, good for tit tape commercials, but it's a no from me otherwise. Stick to putting a ring on it or... a sock in it. Just sssshhh. Please and thanks.   OH OH OH ... OH OH OH OH OH *NO*
Could have done without the gratuitous profanity. Swearing doesn't make you sound "real;" it makes you sound like you've got nothing substantive to say.
sex meets country music
Not Bad
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
I am a country fan and i appreciate her not faking a country accent she doesnt have... this is AWESOME
No. Stop.
👍👏👏👏🌹
song is excellent ❤
Country music stations PLEASE DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH

Where is ur shirt😮
mid
😊👍
Dam I like this better than some of other songs  not big fan of all her music but this good and  different she has talent
Nope. Nice try.
Who came here just to boost Beyoncé over Kanye and then stayed for the great song 🙋‍♀️
This song is horrible! I guess Beyonce can't sing any genre of music well.🤣
Omg cover up. Geeze
Where is her clothes
Wtf is this 😂
No no no no no no   THIS IS NOT COUNTRY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM  COUNTRY ISNT EVEN COUNTRY ANYMORE  George Strait isn't in silence cuz he can't sing anymore . . . he sure can .
Daaammmmnnnnnn
hey its Franklin, coming over to plaay growing little every daaay 💃
"Earned all this money but they never take the country out me"   Beyoncé
What kinda video is this? Why is her 🐈 on repeat???????????
I hate country but this is pretty good. Go ahead Queen Bey
PLEASE PUT A BRA ON
❤❤❤
One of her best.
You will never have the fan base of Taylor swift.quit being jealous and deal with it
Hahaha hahahaha 😂😝😹🤣🤔
##"U" GOT TO (KNOW) "NO" WHEN TO ( HOLD& FOLD)!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
This is silly. I see what they was going for.
The video is boring as hell not even original. It’s so easy for singers to cross over to country.  She’s not the first
Hmmm I love her voice I don't think the half nakedness works .And something bothers me about her voice with country .maybe it's the material and the sound .I do love her other music for sure .totally awsome .❤❤
It sounds more like blues than country
I love this song so far..but I could have done without her being half naked....that would have elevated it for me.
Those side eyes At the Grammy❤ Got it🎵🎼🤠
🎉🎉🎉❤
No😢
Love her voice and love country, but not a fan of this song. And what a strange video lol.
All of a sudden, I am a Beyonce fan!!
Not, country to me. Sorry, country, no more  church sound music and just R&B and hip hop words. Adding guitars doesn't make it country. John pee Kee gospels "I Believe"!😂
This is another sample , its giving Franklin intro cartoon show intro Plus this song is not even giving country music at all
I’m supporting this like she’s an underground indie artist, waiting for her big break
Worst song ever
I love This Song And It's A Big Time Hit On Tictoc
Sounds like the rest of her garbage
Not many views at all
Terrible...Just Terrible...
La canción demasiado buena pero el visualazer nada que ver :S
You got to admire Beyonce, she's multi talented and she straight up bring,no matter what genre of music.❤🤠🎶🎶🎶⭐👍👏👏👏👏👏👏🪭👑🐝
Country Music Turn Cunty Porn!!!
Not a fan of any country song with Beverly Hillbillies banjo in it. Can watch the video with the sound off though.
Country Music Turn Cunty Porn!!!
Country Music Turn Cunty Porn!!!
Country Music Turn Cunty Porn!!!
Country Music Turn Cunty Porn!!!
Excelência.
Country Music Turn Cunty Porn!!!
To all you band wagon and Beyoncé fans.   She doesn't deserve to get into the country genre. She never was a country artist even Taylor Swift will have a hard time going back to country music and she originated from country music. Beyoncé has no foothold and all her new songs are just mock ups of actual country rhythms that’s all.
She make the 40's look amazing
Just because you light skinned don't try to be Miley come on Bee
I am an R&B girlie but this cuntry Bey is making me remember that I had I had a WHOLE  country music phase ( Jo Dee Messina, Alison Krauss, Rascal Flatts) and then later was an avid fan of Nashville the TV show. I’m here for this new era and it’s not forced for me! ❤
Ft Lady Gaga Ft Lady Gaga 🔥🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Shit!!! 👏 Unremarkable talent girl!! 👏
Holy crap this is amazing! I’m a Beyoncé fan if she crosses over to her texas roots!!!
Love her but wtf is the deal with the video repeatedly having the same thing, not something I'd expect from her
Get it B!!!
Basic AF cash grab IMAO .This is a failed attempt at Country music.....furthering her brand. Dolly and Loretta had better lyrics and left things to the imagination.
She wasn't thinking about country music until Reyna Roberts. SMH.
Lol i cant wait to see the "good ol boys" faces when she brings her family to the CMT awards and cleans up all the awards!
This is insulating to country music.
I'm embarrassed for her
Stay in your lane!   This is the worst thing I have ever heard!
There’s no genres she can’t sing !!😊😊😊😊
This makes me miss my hometown in Texas.
This is not a country song
I tap my foot to this trashy conversation
Love it!
Absolutely the worst song. Stick to your normal genre and leave country music alone. Country music butchered is what it sounds like.
😂
❤❤❤
Don’t look like a Texas outfit
Dear Lord, Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave and Toby Keith is trying to come back to life. This is NOT in any way shape or form of country music. Please put some cloths on, and try adding some real country music in here.
This ain't Texas?! What a crappy song.
We need a REAL music video, Bey!!! Pleaseeee!!!
Beyoncé 😄❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😄
Not Beyoncé trying to make a country song it’s not country she is not country
Meh
Beyonce❤❤❤❤
not impressed, maybe dance or move or add some actual entertainment
I wouldn’t say it’s my favorite song 🎧
I love country music an I like some of Beyonces music but country is NOT for U!!
Hey it’s Franklin!!!
Why show so much skin?
So the whole video she stands there and runs her fingers between her breast and plays with a fake pew pew😅😅😅😅
Great song a horrible music video
The title is about her boobs!
Not impressed at all
🩷🤠✨
love country music.  love this song
What a joke...
Country music fans get in formation 🔥🐎
I couldn't call myself a Beyonce fan, but this track just hits with me.
We invented country music and give it to you and we Can take when ever we want this is the prove
Beyonce doesn't have nipples.
There's just something so sexy about women of color embracing that country swagger.
Dolly and Taylor Who lol Queen is taking back them roots !
I LOVE it 🤗 I was born & raised in TX ...... Now I'm in bunk aspirin OK (🤫Shhh don't tell any1) Less than a week u get OVER 5 million views 😮 Keep it 💯 Queen 👑 B is the shizznizz 😜😁😅💖
This needs to never be played on country stations.
I didn't think I would like it. This is hot. You can't stop your body from rocking to it hahaha. Got me remixing line dancing lol.
The song is fine -  typical Nashville cut. Beyonce can sing anything.
Nasty.  Terrible.  Unbelievable how awful this is.
It sucks..an I'm a Beyonce fan...
She got a voice but this is a NO for me
Just horrible.
Now she wants to be apart of Texas. Nah you can go back to New York. You can't find this chick nowhere in Texas. Songs sucks and isn't country. Pop song with a county beat.
this was so bad i wanted to vomit
pure trash
Good song by a beautiful woman.
So here for auntie ❤ I loveeee it no country knowledge goes sad we love this❤😂😅
Country music is apart of Me.
When one can't sing anymore, one becomes naked to distract one's voice to the sexual desires. .
I can see this being played in bars where they do line dances. It's a catchy tune.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤠
Trash 🗑️
She needs to put some clothes on🤠
What a load of nonsense. This is not country, lyrics are so bad. Song is just bad and now suddenly everyone likes country try. This ridiculous world of viral garbage is ridiculous and she looks pathetic in the video. Like dude grow up
Dnt see point n having no clothes on
BEYONCE PLEASE COME TO JACKSONVILLE FL THIS WEEKEND AND PREFORM YOUR NEW #1 @ PBR FOR US❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ YOU ARE AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL 🎉🎉🎉
I’m not really a country fan but Beyonce has my attention on this one.  I like it.❤
How is this not top 10?
I dont like it..
Perfeita em todos os ritmos 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The video is like the movie Groundhog Day
Average country song
lowest costing video of the decade
It's cool that she's branching out and getting in touch with her Texas roots but this isn't country and sounds awful, not her voice, but the rhythm is just bad it seems forced.  You want to hear the Real Queen B listen to Seasons by Bebe Rexha featuring Dolly Parton or Meant to.......this song is very bad, come on Beyonce you can do better!
Wow, everything about this feels… really lazy… a name is only going to carry one so far, smh
I haven’t been feeling Beyonces music lately but this… absolutely love it.
This song sucks. Why did she waste her time. Enjoy Beehive.
A mãe faz tudo ❤🇧🇷
This IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC…. I love country,. This sounds like r&b with a country banjo…..
It's all because pharell Williams has turned Louis Vuitton into a country and western season .
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
MORE BYE MORE!❤❤❤❤❤❤
This DOES NOT BELONG IN COUNTRY MUSIC. First of all Never use words like Bitch.  When 1/3 of the listening audience are under  18.  Secondly. Country music have lost real authentic country songs.  I can't remember the last real song tells a story from beginning to the end .  And leave you thinking "wow"
❤❤❤❤❤
That's a country music parody
Wow, this is fucking wretched! been awhile since I've heard something this awful. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
All the power to her for putting her stamp on different genres, but it should be about the music. She (and other female artists) should not have to be 90% naked. Patsy cline, Loretta, Wynonna, Martina Mcbride etc. never had to show their tits off in their videos to sell their music. It was about the music and they had/have class. Might be the unpopular opinion but this seems trashy to me 🤷‍♀️
Love this!!
You think Beyonce was bad singing country, you should listen to Ringo !
No way I'm buying beyonce going to dive bars and drinking whisky
This is goood!
This woman is a bullet, she just don’t stop lol
I love this. The world would have had zero country music without black Africans & indigenous. They created beat rhythm long before whites ever recorded. If anyone is interested in the documentary "The Rumble" the history of rock n' roll you will get the history of how both were silenced by the U.S. government way back when.
I Love ❤
This shit is horrible....wtf... stick to  your own God damn genre!!!!
Nice song. Why is she practically naked in the visual? How does that do anything but provoke sexual thoughts?
Worst song ever.  Can’t wait for this to never play again
Her voice sounds more beautiful in this song, then some of the recent songs because you hear more instrumental in her other songs, but Here, you really get to enjoy her voice. Wow.
She putting  on a front! She don't like country! She just unleashing her demonic forces on the country music community.  I could be wrong but I'm not!! Don't matter She & her beehive will tarnish & ruin country music!! #Evil #Sasha #fierce  #beehive #queen bee #wasp #bee #repellent  #waterdemon #devilchild
What?!? I like country but not this...
I like this song Beyoncé is doing a great job. I’m not one for country music, but this song is really good.
oh NOW you people like country music  posers
❤❤❤
this is a song that a ROGUE AI would write for a robot to listen to on the Express Elevator to Hell
Amazing song to Two Step too
THIS IS NOT COUNTRY   !   PUT SOME CLOTHES ON  !
THIS IS AWEFUL - SHE IS HALF NAKED - THIS IS NOT COUNTRY WESTERN - THIS IS A SICK ATTEMPT AT TRYING TO BREAK INTO COUNTRY MUSIC - TERRIBLE AND DISREPECTFUL TO COUNTRY MUSIC - NO LONGER A FAN -
jay z got got grown son& daughter over 25 all my truth comes from avbove
SALUTE.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ans stop ling u got blu 😅vy lost set twins last year ond the other 2 one 8 os girl 4 ia boy not yours how fk they twins aeg been carringctwins fo yq ,2 yrs now not pregant now
Playful and purebred country and western! Love it!
Lol.Her voice is Not country.Never Will Be.Whos idea was this .Comical...Neither is Carrie and a lot of that 90s girl singers and today.Lainey Wilson is Country.its all in the vocals
I Don't care what Genre this falls under. I love it. People can be mad all they want. You can't deny someone's talent! Y'all can make up whatever excuse yall want. If you don't like R&B or whatever okay, but to deny someone's pure talent is just crazy. Y'all gone stay mad.
his video is promoting a perception of gun violence.  I don't thin CW music videos shows so much nudity.  Young girls will watch this and think that is what women has to do to get attention!  She has set all women back years and years.  Why can't we earn respect without making everything so indecent and slutty???
Love you, girl
I am happy to see others enjoy this song like I do! 😂
Courny not country music lol 😅😅😅in 2024
Why is her skin white, has she been beaching it
This isn’t country. Y’all fools need to turn on Parker McCollum, Dylan Gossett, Tanner Ursey, Zach Bryan, or Tyler Childers. This is pop 110 percent
She looks like an android, not any were near country?
👎🏾
😍😍😍😍😍
Will never but any of het music.  She's an entertainer and a bad one at that😅😅
That was great!
This visualizer hits different… 🤤
Yal like this???😂
wheres the mastering of the SOUND
This isn’t country music. This is disgrace to the community. This is sad
👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾
❤❤❤❤❤
Beyonce is very southern being a Native from Texas this right up her alley, and she will also succeed in this area ❤👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
🪣
Shame on you John Schneider for ruining the memory of the dukes.
Yikes!!! No!! 😂
I don't like the music Beyoncé sings but this one is catchy.
I don't like a lot of country from the last decade...I heard Beyonce did a country song and I thought it would probably be great.   It is.   Would love it if more talented artists did crossover songs.
This is sounds terrible. Not fitting for her
I just wish they'd sell music w/o the asp
I don't always listen to country music, but when I do. Lol 🤣
It's been a long time since I've listened to a song on repeat, but the day has come, and this song's the one! 🎶🔂 It gets better everytime!📈
This shit ain’t country
Will doggies awesome 👏 ❤❤❤
It sounds like George Eszra
Sry not country -couldn’t understand a damn word
wow 😍😍😍😍😍💞💞💞💞💞
Why does she have to be half naked. Song is great... but.  WOW
Put some damn clothes on. My god, you are a "mother". She belongs to the streets.
So not even remotely county 🙄 n sure don't dress like that shits a joke
Good song
Cosplay Country
It's a great song but not a fan of the nudity.  Unnecessary, distracting.  Rely on your talent Bey, not your body.
Hey it’s Franklin
❤
❤🇸🇦🇺🇸
Icon
اول عربيه ❤
So ironic that I can call her a culture vulture since she's black and all lol
Sometimes I pee but I also sometimes poop when I pee
She saw Taylor swift getting all those albums of the year in country music/pop then said “hold my red cup”
I feel like im back at home on Ft. Worth Texas. Love the sound and lyrics.
I never thought this would happen but she's always doing something new go Beyonce ur awesome
Where can I get a shirt like that
Nope, some people just need to stay in there genre.
❤
I love Beyonce but she sure ain't no Carrie Underwood stay in your lane baby
I'm sorry I'm not a big fan of this song if Beyonce could go down an octave or two it would better
Yessssssssssssssssss bey
What a icky video. Great song, but why on earth would she do this?
Невозможно оторваться)))
Thats not country..nothing country about this..
Illuminati 💯 if you are making good quality music, no need to show your naked body, its cheesy.
Sounds like a pop song
❤❤
This sounds like commercial music.
Blood of Lamb! We see your baphemet symbolism 🐍. 🔥✝️🔥
Very Very Very Nice ❤
does she have the disease Michael Jackson had?
weirdo lmao
This is growing on me a lot!
Ok, I haven't cared for much of anything Beyonce has done since the early 2000's but I'm on board with this song and I wasn't expecting to like it.  Now, let's get the dance remix out with Dolly or Reba!!
"don't need a b*****". Wow! Yeah, not my kinda country music. And when someone says "I don't usually listen to country music, but this is different". That should tell you something. 👎🏻
Wow this must be her worst.
Just bcuz her song says something about texas hold ‘em doesn’t make it country🤣
Sounds like the Franklin theme song
This is not country, it's pop with some what country lyrics
Listen to Taylor swift songs she heavily influenced Beyoncé
Country? What a joke.
Country style R&B, but not exactly traditional country music--and I guess that's ok. If traditional country music audiences snub it, so what?
😂😂😂😂😂 it’s amazing that people actually take this song seriously
The ironic thing about this song and the dance is that nobody likes Texas and it's culture 😄
For everybody saying this is country, it is not country. Seventh generation Texan here.
Ewwww  No way not a fan don't care what backlash I get. No way. Get out of my country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msLOmmrRjD8&t=326s That`s the link which shows all the saga btn Usher and Beyonce
The song SUCKS!!
ela é Maravilhosaaaaaaa
Lmao wtf Beyonce and why is she so light skin now ? Is that not weird
I like this country song and the beat is right on time.
No and no
The origins of country music can be traced to the 17th century, when Africans came to America they brought their folktales, folk songs and favorite instruments like the Banjo. The Europeans were so intrigued by the sounds and musical traditions, alone with the dance movements.  They stole the Country Music genre and claimed as their own. Beyonce reclaimed what was stolen. They mad!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #countrymusic  #countrymusicfans  #salty  #beyonce  #beyonceknowles  #countryradio  #taylorswiftmusic  #banjomusic
🔥🔥🔥 It reminds me of the Jessica Simpson walk
Sounds like crap to me
They always get naked. And, I love it!
This is horrible 🤷
Put some clothes on.
❤❤ você me quebrou
It's crazy how a country music radio won't play this saying she's not a country music singer..but this song is going viral all over the nation with tik tokers everywhere....
Garbage
it's cool you want to step up and try something different but you missed the mark here, sorry to say, this is garbage.
Absolutely creatively beautiful
I'm sorry Beyonce but the country music is not u my ⚖️ scale from 0-10 is  zero I don't like it at all it's simple corny
Can’t wait for Grammy to award beyonce the best R&B performance in 2025
COUNTRY RADIO- BEYS EVERYTHING! SHES IT ALL ❤ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🙏
Am completely disgusted by how much i like this song. Its perfect
In the words of DJ Kaled: “Anutha One!”!!!! Beyoncé is a true legend!!!!!!!
Complete garbage! FYI: The song is actually a re-make of a Canadian toddler, kid's cartoon (Franklyn The Turtle theme song) Talk about an embarrassment as an artist OUCH! 😂 Take a listen...  https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
She brought the white women back w this one 😂 🥵💗
You AAINT Country. Neither. your music
I'm not usually a country music fan,  but I'll make an exception for this little ditty. 🤠🎶
what the fuck
🥰🥰🥰🥰🐝🐝🐝🐝💛💛💛💛🤠🤠🤠🤠
WTH WHY IS THIS SO GOOD. QUEEN B IS DELIVERING
The song is nice and I love the deep voice. This is really country !
Count me in 😊 🤙🦋
Worst country song I have ever heard. Stay in your genre. 👎👎👎👎👎👎🤙
I like the song but it is far from country. Just because you throw a few country words in doesn’t make it country. This would excel on the pop channel
As a born and raised country girl WE DONT WANT HER
Song is good, but the video is boring after the first 30 seconds
WTF was country about this song. Fake country isn't country #bringbackhaggard
❤❤❤
Amei ❣️❣️❣️
Omg great❤
If only she can stop over sexualizing herself people can actually look beyond her "pop" persona and appreciate her talent. I like this song...catchy tune for sure🔥🔥🔥
Could’ve been a lil better but keep on trying
This is ridiculous. What a disgrace to actual country music.
ALWAYS FLAWLESS!!! 😍🥰😍
I can’t stop hearing the “Hey it’s Franklin” theme song. Poor turtle 🐢
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" has now reached #1 on Spotify US! As well as well as iTunes US, iTunes Global(#1 40+ countries so far), and Apple Music! It's projected to hit #1 week 2 on the Billboard Hot 100! 👑🐝
This is horrible
Bey bringing back the ORIGINAL COUNTRY MUSIC making our ANCESTORS PROUD !!!
Quanta mensagem em poucos frames
Taking Country Western over. B doing new. Line dancing
It was ok but not country.  Just R&B country-ish.  Maybe a little slower and the beat is 80’s country.  Bring the beat forward.  I’m black love country and R&B.  No hate but this is not that
I suddenly have a pick up and a dog friend down a dirt road lol
Song sucks and that isn't country music. Stay in your lane and leave country music to the true country singers. You're embarrassing yourself with this so called Country song😂😂😂😂😂
Translate that
❤❤❤
Vivica for life
Hate or love the under dog is on top
Am making presidents in africa
Rubbish I am black but her voice is not country but good try!and why naked???? But a catchy song but is not a country song!
I don't give an f who is the next America black president
Am their baby you know me
Cause they made America what it is today for the Africans which regard themselfs as blacks
Why can't Obama go close to them ?
Ice is my life, both ice, T and cube, look how weak you guys are
Keep visualising
What I will do to you for bringing a Nigerian with a Roca fella jacket to Europe , you can not imagine
You?
You know you are gone
❤
no getting back to this love
Remember once your gone? You are gone forever , I wrote that
What do I know?
Leave me alone and look for yourselfs
Is all on the records
They should cool it off, am giving everything what do you want?
Youtube is too small for this
So you relax
You know the two continents am rulling in the world
Am holding the music industry by the bulls there is nothing you can do about it
County is porn. You're just cun'ty. Heeee cheeein on me wit Becky wit dem guud boots!!!!
That's just the way it is
Let me tell you something, they don't they care about you is the world
Since the last time I posted on your page, what complain about has become worst
Am still telling you, you are older than me and I have respect based on our Age difference, but when it comes to entertainment you need to rest yourself
I be dog. I just became an instant, country music lover and never ever thought that was even possible. Beyoncé, tear this country sh*t up! I love this for you! ❤
I am at a lost.  Is there a message to the world?  I guess she is gearing up to raise money  to become a nominee for the billionaire club.  You can not take it with you.  People will wonder how did Beyonce impact the world?
Shots Fired !!! .. WE will always win in the face of opression. ❤❤❤. These two song are  played every day in my house.
Luv luv the way she releases her new music.
I do like the No Digity style vibe im getting...Danceable solid joint🔥🔥🔥
Very nice song. 😮
Do Not BE a bitch:) that B just brought US All to the floor...side, side 🩰
Beyonce PLEASE DO A VIDEO!!!!!!!!🙏🙏🙏❤😢
Breland is better than this
Ok, beehive... Where's the rest of it?😳
Did she start off with ‘pew…pew’…,🤣
I still love bey but im not a fan of country music and this song didn't change my mind
Great job, Queen!  👑
Texas Hold ‘Em is predicted to go number 1 next week on the Billboard Charts, keep steaming hive!
Love the song but video is boring
From one native Texan to another Beyoncé, how dare you call this country. Country as defining characteristics and this has none of them. Stay in your lane. It is an insult to your native state. Nashville has corrupted country enough without you jumping on the bandwagon. Oh and, it’s even more insulting that you made the video semi-pornographic. Cover the hell up. Texas doesn’t need your help looking any worse than it already does to the rest of the country. You want to do this song, fine, whatever, but call it what you normally do: pop/hip hop, not country. Being from Texas you know what country music is, George Straight, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, hell even Okie Toby Keith (who is rolling in his freshly dug grave I’m sure, God rest his soul), Chris Kristofferson. You know better Beyoncé. Stay in your pop/hip hop lane and don’t ever call anything you do country again.
Felicidades TEXAS HOLD 'EM # 1 Spotify USA Y # 2 Spotify MUNDIAL regresaste reinando las listas de éxitos. Mereces  con esta canción hacer historia  con un debut  #1 en el  Hot 100 de Billboard. Éxitos reina.
I'm a country girl from the south I have followed every country singer out there I know all their music well I have to say I love the song I think it's different women from the south make their self look lady like nothing against beyoncé I think the outfit is a little too much women from The South cover theirself up and just in my opinion everybody has one I wish you would have did a line dance with this music beyoncé is talented I wish you would have went more into character on the dance floor but I'm hoping somebody out there comes up with a line dance but you go b I love the song
making history
I was a fun of country before it was popular
The marketing team just should just release the song. It would have crossed over to country. She is a well rounded artist. I love the song... Beyonce is a ICON... I see a Line Dance with this song... KEEP INSPIRING BEE!!!❤❤❤❤
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
😅 omg please No. Just because you're her fan doesn't mean you have agreed that she's a country singer.  So ridiculous.  😅😅
boring
This sounds like a pop song. It literally does not sound like a country song at all. It is catchy and I like the song but this is not country sounding at all.
One thing about it. You ain’t gotta like her. But you have to give credit where credit is due. She divides and conquers pretty much everything she sets out to do. And this isn’t nothing short of genius and unBEYlievable.
This is no Texas but it a hit
Tits out
She so good love how she moves
Tits out😅
Naughty
She sexy
🤠
Love Beyonce but I'm still never going to like country music
been a long time since we've heard some real country
I'm not even a Bey fan but boy do these songs slap!
wow she's back!
Ole town road
😂😂 after that dumb jay z rant over a participation trophy worrying about having album of the year (maybe she should drop an album thats worth being album of the year, not just a couple of singles and some filler)she’s being a follower trying to be like Jellyroll. The difference is Jelly can do country and rap music, he has range and writes his own music. This is being forced onto country music, this isn’t country…is the production from real instruments and musicians playing them? This can easily be done on pro tools…I don’t even listen to country music and I know it’s blasphemous. Can’t be mad that country music stations don’t want to play a r&b singers’ songs BECAUSE THEY ONLY PLAY COUNTRY MUSIC!! Guitar notes on a beat doesn’t make it country! This is what Beyoncé fans are upset about? The beehive? Fuck the beehive I’ll bust out some Raid on that honeycomb…riding this hard thinking she gonna give a damn about you for a r&b song …idiots
Well done an amazing song
Beyonce can literally kill it in any genre of music!
She's having fun and God is she hot as holy hell in this video.
nope
Act 2 was worth the wait❤❤❤
Why does she need to dress so nasty. Just think of all the young women that are looking up to her.
I guess that money can't buy class  She is so trashy
😍😍😍
Listen #Envolver and #Bellakeo
I like it, but sounds more like a mockery of country music.
I'm here because of all the nurses and doctors on social media recommending to use this song while doing CPR 😂😂
Yikes 🙃🕳️.....✝️
I absolutely love this! I feel more connected with my Dallas roots ❤❤❤
Country Dolly, Taylor ó Shania
Asko Beyoncé 😂
Omg. Beyonce naked. Surprise.
No self repecting Texas woman wears nothing. Jmho
i guess the beyhive about to put their stirrups and cowboy hats on and line dance.....LOL
That outro just HITS🤖🍯
16 miscarriages🧚
I’m ready for the line dance!😩
Not trying to be rude but this is not even Country she is rich and knows nothin bout the country it’s actually offensive
Best song she's ever had, wow.....🔥
Beyoncé has been ready for country music for a long time. The question is, is country music ready for Beyoncé? I know I am.
Space CowBey is something I did not know I needed in life
Not a fan of Beyonce, but she sang it beautifully and effortlessly; it's like country music is the real home of her vocals, in other words, her organic frequency of vocal vibrations. Her unique bounciness, or vibrato, perfectly blends with the tones and grooves of the country genre. Brava, Beyonce. And, the ancestors of the genre would like to say, "Welcome back home, suga! You should stay much, much longer this time."  🤔...It would be interesting to hear Beyonce and Willie Jones, another American (the real copper-colored people of the American hemisphere) country singer, from Shreveport do a song together.
Pimp c
I never thought about listening to country music but after hearing daddy lessons I knew I would love bey country album! 🤠🖤
Im counting 750 plays every 10 secs 2/18/24 12:55am
I see a line in the near future.  I need Dolly’s voice in there somewhere. 😂
TERRIBLE!!!! Beyonce stay on the left where you belong!!! Sounds just like all of her sh!t music!!!!
franklin theme song sample
I love this song
And I'll be damned if I can't slow dance with you Come pour some sugar on me, honey too 😍🥰
Music is good, the outfit doesn’t look country.
Impressive interpretation 🎉
Yea.... I'm not feeling this. Nas x did a better job with his country song with Billy Ray
This is not country. It's a disgrace
Catchy song. Someone should tell Beyoncé you don’t have to take your clothes off to sing.
Alright Bey! Dam that duke of hazard guy!
Well I guess if you don't like the song you like the visual she got to sell it some way. I am not here for either . Just because she does good work she's not good at everything this one is not it. But I guess some people would like her if she was singing in a land fill.
BeyHive! "Texas Hold Em" is projected to debut at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 after only 4 days of the first charting week! Let's get it to #1 for week 2!
What is this?
Ugh
Nope
This is actually genius, dgaf.
what a stupid video,  and a shitty song  👎👎
Like.. it simply slaps
I'm pushing buttons in my GS sedan babi😌😍😍😍😍
NASTY PUT CLOTHES ON ALREADY
Yasssss ma'am  southern girlz 👑
she trusts that jacket more than i trust my own parents
this isen5 fuckin country lmao
I keep watching this video hoping for a wardrobe malfunction that never comes.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Countryoncé
This woman scares me when she mentions natural disaster. She predicted the world-wide 'signal' in her song Alien Superstar. Her lyrics read:  Please do not be alarmed, remain calm Do not attempt to leave the dancefloor The DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot test of the entire system  That signal is supposed to assist our evolution as a human species. Hense why this woman keeps betraying herself as a hybrid of human & robot.   Now there is a tornado and  a heatwave in her city? Chile....
This is awful
I like it. Fuck ya'll for being mad about it.
She won't make it in Country. This is not country, it's disgusting.
just has to TRY to bring gutter to Country. It will NOT be received...stick to your pole
hoe down....i hope
I don’t like country music, but I like this one!
Literally just does the same thing every time. There nothing even country about this video. 🤦🏼‍♀️
You can take the girl out of Texas but you can’t take the Texas out of the girl
This isn't country.. but Beyonce props
🔥🔥🔥
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
overRATed
Not a fan of her’s but I like this song. I’m just not sure why it’s the same image over & over?
It ain't country
in what world is this classified as country music?
Couldn’t stand country unless I’m driving to the country and the station changes then it’s all love but outside of that nah. But  now that Bey rockin’ it… lol
This song is hard not to dance to ! Cheers from BC
She is not country - some things you should leave alone . Not a Beyoncé fan
That’s not country music. Alan Jackson and George strait are country. This is garbage.
Thats the openong to Franklin the turtles theme song.
Sound better than any country singer i ever heard.
Crap stick to what she knows, not really country. She is trying to hard in the lines . Sorry not great
The people saying this is unique haven't heard much country. 😅💀
Why does she have to be half naked? Come on its 2024 talent does not require getting your kit off anymore.
Boring song
It sounds like someone’s music that has put together.
Anyone else hear similarities with this song and Dixieland Delight by Alabama? I don't think it's sampled in the song, my ear just hears them in a similar way 😊
Beyoncé said, “Y’all want country music?? Hold my beer…”
Guy, don’t worry, seriously. Beyoncé got this. We’re going to be alright.
I L♡︎VE THIS SO MUCH !
Franklin
Honestly if her whole album is country, I’d go to the concert.
Wow love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rainha !!
this is horrible. She better listen some Luke Combs and learn how good music sounds
She needs to stop
it doesnt matter if you are from texas this doesn't make it country at all sorry
Best song she has released in years!
Love this song but this video is cringe.
ENAUGHT !! 🤮
Don't be a b-Tch come take it to the floor now!!! BEST LYRIC EVER!
I am No a country fan but some how I feel this is okay country song. Not a Dixie chick hit or Reba McEntire. but no, I love Rihannon Giddens.
This is the official video. Really? What the hell
I hear more folk than country in this.  It’s a bit of both and something specially much more.  It’s extremely hopeful, I love the beautiful backbeat of this tune.
I like it.
Country song but why be naked, 🤮🤮
I’m loving this.. a lot!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Hey it’s Franklin
Nice 🤠 video and song!! I liked it
Booooo

Ughh why Beyonce so talented 😩 not a big country fan but loving this.
They better add this on the new season of young sheldon
I don't like it,she should not do country ever.Just my opinion
HOLD 'EM.. Yes Bey ill be on that dance floor everytime your tune comes on luv it 🤠💃💖
I can’t even lie this ole gal got me too
This is stupid
This video is stupid, she could have done something amazing as the song is awesome. Instead it’s garbage on repeat. Put a shirt and some pants on 🙄
This isn’t country. It’s trashy. And she’s overrated.
Song is awesome! I’m sorry why must this look be so it now! Showing so much! Too much for no reason. This isn’t playboy, ok be sexy but too much
I think she did a great job on the song but why she gotta be half naked in the video , that doesn’t throw out country music vibes
At first, I thought I wouldn't like Beyonce doing country but hearing this I was like ok girl
The first black female country singer with major success was Linda Martell who was also fist black female on the Grand Ole Opry!
All i hear is Mileys song Flowers 😅
Stop. Fucking stop ✋
All i can hear is "I Can Buy Myself Flowers write my name in the sand talk to Myself for hours say things you dont understand" sings Miley Cyrus 😂
When she said "hoedown" i was like "Ohh, who she call a Hoe?" 😮
✨👀🥰👋🏽👋🏽🥰👏🏽👏🏽💃🏽💃🏽👏🏽👏🏽💃🏽💃🏽👏🏽👏🏽💃🏽🔥🔥🥰👋🏽👋🏽🙏🏽Thank you Beyoncé 🌹💖🙏🏽🥰👋🏽👋🏽✨
Did she just do 1 song or a whole album?
She already beautiful and need more cloths on for country music
Yess Beyonce Babee! I'm Definitely Country Girl! I love The Country Music 🎶 ♥ 😘 🌹 👑
What's with the no bra an skimpy underwear? Never seen country singers dress like this performing
This isn’t country music but okay lol it’s catchy though.
Okay, ready to learn the line dance for this one.
This is a great song 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I can't be the only one thinking this video don't match the vibe 😂
I came after seeing "Beyonce is doing country now" from people who don't know what country is. Song is cool I guess. Not my thing. Defo not country. Not even close!
1:51 Anybody else hear the Doug theme song in their head?
🎉🎉🎉
When did she get a boob job?
What a masterpiece song stream on Spotify for global chart #1 now on place 3
She's made a brilliant move to country music  ❤
This ain't it
I want her to sing two of the lucky ones by Droge and the Summer's Band
Texas representing! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🤠💃🏼who would’ve thought Beyoncé be making country jams
Bring it back to the roots from whence it came!🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
TO THE BEY HIVE: Please look into the history - un-White washed version - if country music. Check out the first person to record a "country" song or perform at the Grand Ol Opry. In fact, he gave the show its name. What you'll walk away with??? Country music is BLACK music. Too! (Rock n roll, jazz, blues, gospel, R&B, Hip Hop, etc).
I like country music, yes today I find out about the two  videos, Both are fantastic.
I don't like it. I'm sorry no white women in county have there breast out. It just doesn't fit. I'm sorry
I love Beyoncé but like when black people do this it’s ok but if white people rap we’re culturally appropriating? Make it make sense
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Song is terrible.   Video boring.  She brings a new meaning to the words ho ho ho hodown.  Her children must be so proud
Parece um vídeo que fica repetindo no spotify 😂
Vamos geral para o Spotify ❤
This is giving me Old Town Road vibes. Nothin but a publicity gimmick.
Her attire will be her undoing. Song wasn't bad.
The music took me to red dead redemption 2 immediately
Not to bad tho😊
Trying to switch to country on the coat tails of jelly roll
Lol this ain’t it. If you feel the need to be represented in country music, Darius Rucker did a fine job. But you don’t know who that is do you? Shame.
Love it!  Beyoncé can sing anything!
Please make it stop! Please! No girl. Stop it!
This song sucks.
Feels forced big time
😳 um🤔 it would have to grow on me.☝🏽😃 Ask me this time next year.
Bold and sexy. She’s definitely opening doors for artists of color in that genre.
It makes me want to throw up
Its not country music its wrap and if you cant tell the difference you aint country.
As I expected, absolutely trashy and obscene
This is pop music.
Bey is rockin' that country side of her. And to John Schneider and anyone else who's spitting the negativness, you can't break Queen Bey!
This is corny as hell and it is no where near Country Music
Girl just sit down this is horrible 🥴🥴🥴🥴
Anybody else realize she put herself on loop and keep watching the loop for 3 minutes and 57 seconds? No? Just me. 😂😂❤
#CHAPEL HART
Does anyone understand what this video means? Why is it just a repeating loop of her walking, touching her abdomen and pretending to shoot with her left hand? What does a silver snake on the left eye mean? I really like this song but the video is strange.
Beyonce needs Jesus
okay so were now trying to F#k our way to a grammy?
Billy can't you send some one to the door.❤
It's overly rated just because its Beyonce.......
i would
Put on some clothes.
Absolutely terrible
This really is the Franklin theme song lol haha
Haim should cover this.
I know the Franklin theme song when I hear it
Miss Beyoncé Cuntry Queen you killed this🔥
Love it get  it 🐝 ❤ talented as heck
Its not bad , but she will get the same issues Olivia Newton John had where the community will be mean to her for npt being country enough.
This country music is different ❤️
??  #1??? bruh
This is pop not country lmao😂
This isn’t country music this is pop bullshit with a banjo in the background 😂
Me playing RDR2 with this on in the background
Just because she said Texas makes it country??
✨💖💕🎶🤠✨💕🎶💖
Must be getting old now 😆
I enjoyed the tune, but the video was too repetitive. It was distracting.
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Meh. Its Ok, nothing special.
Love this. I like country music.
She needs to dress appropriate for country. Country women don't dress like this
Dsl je pense que elle allez créé une nouvelle dance pour tout le monde allez danser ça danser  le clip et juste avec de la sensualité  mais  adder pas  aux clipp
I'm Loving this..  Those who don't approved and stay mad🤔  This only bring about an interest from a new audience to Country music.  I've grown up on traditional Country, I love it All!  The new generation of Country artist is bringing new eyes/ears to this genre.😊
Just a marketing idea to combat the push back. Maybe a collab version with Reba or Dolly. Its sucks that we have to have a White stamp to be accepted in a music genre we started, but such is Black American life for crossvers. Also a tush push infused danced would work with this song. Congrats on your next country music award and grammy.  Also on that point please publicize your numbers Sis. That way if they attempt to stiff you, we can call them out on it.
cultural appropriation say what! 😄😂
Okay this isnt country 😂 but i am a beyonce fan
Go Beyoncé🤠🤯
it’s a no for me. I liked Lil nas x , record better.
Ok, this video didn't capture the song. I like the tune but visually I didn't get it... it's a hit for sure.
wow...double sux...country & urban pop equals a great big shitcicle
this song has been on repeat for dayssss, im scottish but you’re making me yee haw bey! 🤠
Country? This is awfully hilarious. What people do for money!

Greetings to the American people, I love you and your music with all my might I always dreamed of visiting the United States of America, but the difficulty of life did not suit me.....the important thing is, I wish you a happy life from your Algerian friend.
vraie question : qqn peut m'expliquer le sens du clip à scène unique et répétitive ? Liée aux paroles ? A un autre symbole ?
I mean who wouldn’t love seeing side boob from her BUT did they have a very tiny budget for a video it cost maybe $50 or $60 dollars to make depending on how much that costume cost.
Girl put  some clothes  that's just  nasty. And that country  take from country  girl who grew up listen  to country  music.  The Devil  be lie. You ain't  country
No!!
Don't sound like Country music 😂😂
Jay Z is going to be mad because she ain’t winning album of the year again with this
I drive a Lexus! And it’s parked! 🔥🤘🏾
💔https://youtu.be/jQcOc5XXJzk?si=zlhyeTuzAo7hcVDv
Beyonce,  Girl!!! I ❤️ that song, I can't stop playing over
BEYONCE NEEDS JESUS  SHES CONFUSED  ONE DAY WHEN THE WORLD STOP CHANTING HER NAME AND THEY TURN AGAINST HER SHE'LL  THEN NEED THE LORD I JUST HOPE THAT IT WONT BE TO LATE!
Beyoncé can’t be stopped!!! 💜💜 love it…
Hey take that jacket off you might get more country fans.
This is so awesome!! She's charting in the country charts. Wow! She's definitely the best. Now she's taking over country music. Iconic.

Hey 🐝👑😍😍😍🦋
Good music rarely goes trending!
😂😂😂..NOOOOOOOOOO..
Heyyyy it's Franklinnnn 🎶
Her voice is shaky and unstable like she's afraid of being a fraud.
Wake up people it was all a joke
I agree with John Schneider. This heifer needs to sit down with this terrible harsh drawl. IDGAF what anyone says. She cannot sing!
So now what's next B-hive do a Texas Square Dance.
I think she's telling Jay z no more black music from me. Let New York dance to this
The worst sh!t I've ever heard.
You're in your feeling you need Christ
Pourquoi elle a toujours besoin d être nue elle a peur de chanter mal avec des vêtements normaux ?
Love the song but hate all the swear words. It’s getting impossible to listen to music around my kiddos.😢
A era Music chega para todas!!!
Trash!!!!
Love Beyonce.  Hate her two new country songs.  They just aren't good. . .
Why does she need to come out half naked?? She already sells alot of albums. Its not like she needs to show it all. I have never seen Beyonce like this. She was so  classy but I guess not anymore
Trash
Good song video is lame
That's the amazing Rhiannon Giddens on Banjo and Viola. Please Check out her music and history of the music she does. Rhiannon Giddens (The Carolina Chocolate Drops,  Our Native Daughters. She foes Ameriana, folk, country, bluegrass, jazz, opera, Irish.  She writes ballets and operas as well. She is an amazing artist and person. You might learn something.
Thank you 🙏 Beyoncé for bringing soul back to country
Escutando só agora, e essa música esta muito boa!
Definitely not country looking like that and the words    please give it up you ain't got the country  sorry
Wtf is this trash!? Waylon and Merle are rolling in their graves.
Wtf is this trash!? Waylon and Merle are rolling in their graves.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Arrazou
Cade o clipe?
She just bad at country don't know shit about living in the country. Give me Darius any day just keep this crap with honky tonk out of country. This is more folksy like for the barefoot hippies style not hardworking blue-collar country
Danko Queen B❤😊
Nice video... 😉
I love Beyonce I love country music this is reminding me of hannah montana movie at the hoe down lol this some hot doodoo fr
Oh boy wonder who's her and Jay-Z gonna get mad at the CMT awards because his wife didn't win 😂😂😂😂😂 this song is wack as hell
This is NOT country mysic😂😂😂
She gon have the girls reverse cowgirl to this album 😂🤠
She's already admitted to being a Texas Bama so... now she's finally expressing her inner country...
This is amazing
I'm not a country music girlie but this put a yee in my haw. Beyonce doing us Texans proud. Love her
I don't understand the lack of clothes....she is so talented...this does not fit
That's a darn catchy song!
This is such shit lmao
Que sentido los visuales y no sacar el video musical y ya
😳😳😳 it’s not good! 👎
All this jiggle makes me think of Stellar Blade lol.
Well, yee-howdy! <3
Y’all piss me off. Just listen to whatever you want. It’s not hard. There are other black artists that have been doing this for years. Where was this praise then? Get real. Also everyone of you are fucking hypocrites. Other artist try out different genres and you rip their heart out. Do better.

This is a desperate attempt at country to make herself revilent again. Terrible
FINNA CREATE A LINE DANCE TO THIS STAT! ❣️(#wediditfirst)
This video is like her music: repeat-repeat-repeat-repeat-repeat. Sorry, but I'm immune to her musical charms.
Who produced that video? It's rough for an A level star.
I love how there is buzz about white country music yet the black roots with banjos and fiddles were happening back then nice to see fresh music from Beyonce reclaiming her roots .not much of a fan of the music but she is talented - I which she would keep some clothes on .lol - All the best to her and her passions .
I like the song and if you close your eyes and listen its super cute ..the video is disconnected from it all the hair is just not Texas sorry Beyonce love you but find a better video producer that's just wrong
Blacks invented country. Taking back what's OURS  ...
She should be embarrassed
This is just Silly.
Historically every time country music start to fade they interject it with black talent and later claim country music is becoming popular again. Black people can't get in there events so why save it. Not a good look for B.
Momma bey 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Excellent! I’m a former DJ of more than 30 years, I salute Queen Bee for having the talents to do this excellent, unique country tune!
Does being from Texas make you country?
The Disco Duck of Country
No, sorry but I don’t like!
Trashy music
Lamest song and video I’ve seen in a long long time… many blk folks that do amazing country music, this ain’t it.
This is not country music sorry not sorry
Y’all not viewing this enough for me !! Should be at 10m views
Can anyone say CULTURAL APPROPRIATION!!??? I guess this is ok though right?
I already have an outfit in mind for the concert 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
We invented it anyway what do you expect lol 🍺
Damn this is boring.
I’m amazed at all the positive feedback. This really isn’t a good song, nor is 16 carriages. I see a lot of Beyoncé fans supporting her endeavor, which is cool, but as someone who listens to country music all the time, this isn’t it. To be clear, I’ve liked Beyoncé a long time, both as part of Destiny’s Child and after… she is talented, beautiful, one of a kind, and a music icon. But this song wasn’t successful for me…very gimmicky. Country music tells a story. This didn’t feel genuine.
Call me old fashioned but wtf's up with the outfit...or lack thereof!?
This ain't country go back to pop rock just go back back back back back 😂😂
As someone born and raised in Nashville.... Fuck this fad riding bullshit. Stay in yo lane, we don't want or need you here.
Over sexualizing black women. Diminishing their natural beauty and strength. Good job Beyondsaving!
Yes, yes, yes
I always hear people say “(insert name here) is brave” but WOW!.. this is REALLY brave! Bless her heart!
I actually like this song ❤
I'm not getting it... this is not country nor is the video. Put some clothes on!
I'm open-minded but this ain't it. Sorry
Waiting to see the Country line dance to this song😂😂😂😂HEE HAW!!!;
1:49 wow Beyonce naked in a video jay must have pissed her off she said im foing it😮
Wasn't a beyonce fan before and definitely not after this song true country fans know what's up
How many times..... will caucasian people STEAL from other cultures. Than get "angry" when it's reclaimed & ACT like they own it. Honestly. It's pathetic & disgusting. But all love to everyone, all the same.
This is not country music sorry to burst yall little  bubbles.  Back to drawing board.
The attire is just all wrong for Nashville!
Caucasian angry people... no offense. But you have some nerve being "angry" when you STOLE COUNTRY MUSIC from black people to BEGIN with. Granted, yall created CLASSICAL music. THAT you can say you own. But country music BEEN ours. If anything we LET you have it, for so long. Because we had no choice plus later generations of black folk wasn't feeling the genre anymore.... but we can. And WILL reclaim it. Whenever we damn well desire to. And you will deal with it.   Thank you for another glorious masterpiece Ms Bey. Love you Queen. 😘👑
This is not country...
What the hell did I listen to John Schneider the right about what he said about her
I like this song, but This video is weird .. lol
Legendary stuff
I'm a fan of this beautiful talent Queen   Beyonce❤ and i love her new country songs. Am a Texan and love some country music.  I believe this album will hit the charts #1. This song can become a awesome line dance for everyone.  Ms. Beyonce.  You have broken the black soul into black country soul👍congrats and continue to bring more of your hits  music / videos for the world to enjoy.  Much  love to you Beyonce 😍your fan from Texas
Never a fan but this is exceptional !
Hey its Franklin ....
This song is actually pretty good 👍🏿
please wear a proper clothes.
Black folks been on country music. Go check on Charlie Pride.
Ang chaka ng music ni bey recently. Trying to stay relevant
Who cares.. no one owns the music genres.. why is everyone so upset.  Every artist can put out their music and if it sells it sells.. all this hate of whether it is country or gospel or whatever is just hate.. She doing her thing her fans will dig it and everyone that doesn't like her music wont.. Just let her do her thing and enjoy that all kinds of artists can do all types of music.. QUIT WITH EVERYTHING HAVING TO BE IN THE POLITICAL REALM AND DIVIDING PEOPLE.  THIS ALBUM IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. BEYONCE IS MAKING MUSIC. IF YOU LIKE IT LISTEN. IF YOU DON'T THEN DONT LISTEN.. PEOPLE ALL FULL OF HATE INSTEAD OF JUST ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DO THEIR THING..
That sh*t is nasty!!😠
Hey its Franklin!
She sold her soul to the devil. She lets Demons channel her body to perform. Look up Shasta/Beyonce
WE don't need to see your boobs to enjoy the song...
This song is sooooooooo good ✨✨✨
her fit screams rock here, or am i trippin???
Not impressed
Nothing original here at all, but sure fire cross chart Number 1. Big salute to the plastic surgeon and the visual effect crew.
This song sucks. Plus she is the devil, she can stay in new York
I love it ❤
poderosa demais, gnt😍🤌🏽
my love
She needs to do something besides shotgun finger
I LOVE THAT SHE DID NOT CHANGE ACCENTS OR ANYTHING ITS STILL IN FABULOUS BEY FASHION
If she's so talented, why does she have to rely on an up-close shot of her breasts every 8 seconds???
She sounds better singing country. I'm not a fan of her voice. I really wished that women would stop selling their music with their bodies. Really! That's where really talent is when you can sing without presenting yourself naked before the world. Example: Whitney Houston
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
💎💎💎💎💎
💜💜💜💜💜
HELP J. MICHELLE THIS NOT IT NOT COUNTRY ENOUGH BEATS OFF KEEP PRACTICING
Blacks should stick to rap. This shit is terrible.
Lordy this is so fierce !!!!!
This song sucks
Brilliant song by the amazing Beyoncé!!!
I HATE the video, but i can get with the song 🎵
Can't say much for the song, but she forgot her pants.
As far as her musical skills are concerned, Beyonce sure does have great tits!!!
Wow 😮 talk about next level ❤❤❤
electronic music in act I (2023), country music in act II (2024), pop in act III (2025) and retirement (Feb/26) with the much-coveted Album of the Year, Record of the Year or Song of the Year. See you soon.
Love the song! The "Official Visualizer", not so much,
This song is straight ass. Doesnt resemble country in the slightest.
Fuck Illuminati free Palestine
Hopefully she does a song with Jimmy Allen.
There’s a few reasons I love Beyoncé and this is an example of one
This is not country, sounds just like bro country. Its pop. Also, country folk love their country the USA, liberals don’t
Giving it a chance. Not too bad. You can take the girl out of Texas but you can't take the Texas out of the girl.
I Love you Beyoncé
It has to be the worst song I've ever heard 🤦‍♀️
The song and visuals of this are fucking trash lmao. 😂
Hard af!!!!
Thank you Beyonce I put me a country instrumental ringtone now
Black surpremist intentionally attempting to dominate WHITE CULTURE
Why cant she find something else to do in her spare time.. She has enough money
Beyonce will be naked 2024 💯
Theres nothing genuine behind her.. Power trips for fun. And this aint country. Again. A  power tripping hobby in the name of black surpremcy
Just wasted 3 mins of my time. I couldn't even listen to the full 4 min song. Complete garbage
She's by far a country star she suck
it’s a no for me sorry
Trash
It's not country. It's pop. Just like any other new country for the most part is. I can dance to it though lol that's all I care about.
Love it 100%. This is a great line dancing song. ❤
Well this is just great now country music sucks.
The lingerie/onsie/leotard/unitard costumes are so played.
How is this a good song? Her voice is good but she says nothing. Why does she have to be damn near naked to do this video if you can call it a video? Did we all see and hear the same video? I initially thought I was being punked  but it’s real? Wow
The video doesn't fit in with the song...
She needs to stick to what she knows. This sounds horrible

I cried it’s that damn good
ho no
😂😂😂😂😂 ok lol
This is awful. Not country. Can’t believe people like this!!
I dont believe this is only 3 million!!!
This is a hybrid. Like it!
Now all of a sudden blacks like country music lol.
Why semi-nude
Just No. your not country so don’t try
Put some clothes on, no country folks drive a lexus, country woman dont sing or promite the use of the word B#$ch.  Country music is being demolished. Someone please  stand up and put some real country back on the radio
Just Terrible
5.7M streams … 300k streams away from hitting #1 on global spotify and 100k streams away from hitting #1 on US spotify.  PUSHHH HIVE PUSHHH
Please forward all Royalties to Bruce Cockburn, I’m sure he ll take it as a compliment that Beyoncé chose to cover his song….🐢🐢🐢
This hits different ❤🎉 this is just super magnificent ❤❤  modern country music ❤🎉 Much love from Zambia 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🔥🇿🇲🇿🇲🔥🇿🇲🔥🇿🇲🔥🇿🇲🔥
Always think of a laundry sheet when I hear her name.
🙌🏾
Nice job Beyonce!
I like it and I'm not country music fan   well done
Ok I was skeptical.... don't really think its in her heart to turn to country music but this song sounds good.
Ewww
Rock bottom boring and boring videos.
I fucking hate you she is freaking good high notes and low notes she is so good     Edit: by the way im not being mean when i say i fucking hate her it means i love her she is just so good so yall stop blowing up my fphone.
Get out of satan system and get in God system before it’s to late Beyoncé. ⏳
"wth...fk it"-Charlie pride👍
First off, country music was hijacked a long time ago. Country ain't Country. Stars like Tammy ,  patsy, Loretta, ..Didn't need no last names, didn't declare it either.. Guys like George , Merle,  Charlie and Willie n Waylon were pushed aside for pop and rap influence. 3 poor writers in Nashville gone commercial, pick ups and tail gates and mustard stains and bare feet crap.  So to throw some half naked Beyonce  in the mix , makes no difference to real Country fans.  Just more pop crap..  We've gone underground..
A Beyoncé nasceu o Texas,uma das poucas coisas boas deste estado americano,pelo menos o que eu acho😊😊
God Almighty bless
❤
WoW!❤ Thank you Beyonce! Fantastic song!
flop.
❤️ It!! My Gurl
straight fire🔥🔥
Not bad. It would've been cool to hear some local bar names in the song.
THIS IS TRASH. Cmon there are black female country music artist who are amazing. This is awful, the rnb vical runs with the meaningless lyrics this isnt country, this is Beyonce with a guitar
Video leaves a lot to be desired though… was expecting something better from B. But great song.
Literally the whole video is about her walking in, pulling out a gun, shooting and the same thing all over again 😂
wts is this trash?
Soo, Biden-Beyonce laser eyes… did she said:”F U Texas.” ?
I am a country girl from the Sip and also a Beyoncé fan. I ride horses and my family has always owned horses, cows, goats, pigs and etc. My grandfather and dad always wore cowboy hats.I was picked on by classmates because we were “country”. I am loving this for a number of reasons!  I love country music but I wondered how black ppl became so excluded from the genre when some of the earliest known cowboys were black and a lot of black musicians were the pillar of what country music is today. Keep doing what you do Bey!
I hate the visualizer but i like the song
Queen talking about the border crisis❤
Country Queen ❤️
Maybe with stronger vocals and a play with the song instrumental, and a wayyy better meaning video to go along with it, this song could’ve been decent but I’m sorry I love Beyoncé but this is just lazy and sloppy and she didn’t do herself justice, it’s like each year she’s releasing worse music. Damn
Stop B 😂
❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wooooooo
They Ready the Texas Trend has begun
Bless ya heart..this ain't country music n definatly not Texas..don't throw those cards on Mirandas table maam
Au début c un peu étrange country et beyonce puis ça le fait quand même c la Queen B
Okay I can hop on the support wagon for this bc we should all support black country music. It's been a while since I've been a fan lol
She is Queen for real 😍♥️🇧🇼🇧🇼
Great start! Keep it up baby!
❤❤❤🎉
I love this song so much!
I love you Beyonce but CAN YOU DO AN ACTUAL VIDEO PLEASE???
So cool.
When did she get implants, I guess JZ was stepping out or looking to, lol. How pathetic to be this vain and shallow, she’s got a career, money, fame, power, and a family, but all of that wasn’t enough, she needed something more, it’s never enough, pathetic, she should write that as her next crappy country song, lol
Tacky video clip 🤢
I will be buying this just for the culture.
Порно звезда,браво! Высокое искусство 👎
She must really been tired after tour....this is on repeat
not a fan anymore but glad your doing this so all the whte culture vultures can get a taste of their own medicine. So I dont want to hear shyt about why is she doing country...sit down and drink it down.
Country thunder song
Texas hold em
Le son est top mais le clip laisse à désiré 😂 c'est dommage pour du country
Wow wow wow i am in love and loving country music now more than ever
This is sandy's song
WTF....this is trash....Taylor swift....should give her lessons
Can’t wait for her to collaborate with other country music artists of color, like Mickey Guyton & The War and Treaty. 🙏🏾   And I wouldn’t be mad if she brought Kelly and Michelle in for some of those three-part country harmonies either…
👋😎⚡🎶🎵🎶👌❤🇨🇭👍💋👋
WHY DURING "BLACK HISTORY" MONTH IS SHE TURNING COUNTRY LOOKING BLEACHED AND TRYING TO BE EUROPEAN....WTFC IS GOING ON? YALL WILL BUY ALL THEY BULLSH!T💯‼️   THIS IS NOT BLACK MUSIC...TF
The amount of people calling this "country music" is wild. Its a nice try, I guess, but this got ratio'd for a reason.
Eu nem tinha percebido que o vídeo voltava toda hora kkkkk
Ready for to drop music video for house 🏡 ❤❤❤
❤❤❤
No no no no no!
THIS SONG IS SEXY ASF!!!!! Best song she has done in years!!! woooohooo go BEYONCE!!!
I'll definitely listen to her before I'd listen to Blake or Jason.
I love the song, but more scenery  should have been added unless i'm missing something
What kind of video is this supposed to be? Lots of repetition. It's almost like it's supposed to hypnotize you.
Welll then gone ahead then and bring country music back to its roots Beyoncé....... this is down-home take me to the river to be baptize black gospel music from the vocal arrangements to the time signature, to the story, all the way down to store front church foot stopping drive🔥 … To summit all up American culture is black culture and no matter how much she hates and envies us.... America has Hebrew Israelite ✋🏾lack people Who built this nation to thank for its culture because it has no culture independent of us!
She ain't this slim.
Tiddies just poppin' 🤣☺
Don’t be a “Whoo” come take it to the flo now 😍👩🏼‍🌾
Holy shit, She said I own country music. My people invented that shit 🎵🎶🎶🎵🎶
Music taste is subjective unless you are comparing it to vultures which is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song has a boogie shuffle w soulful harmonies, good job queenB
That's why you're beautiful -> daddy lessons -> 16 carriages
❤
This is so bad
OK song, there was no need to sexualize it. This is not the strip club
if you want to hear something country and pitiful try finding "Achy Breaky Heart" It's tragic! Tracy Chapman also sings "Country" .  I'm happy that guy that  re-popularized "Fast Car" although  his singular rendition needs something... It might be called "Emotion" or Cadence!
Nice👍
so women can't wear pants these days and cant even wear tops?
It's that 3:17 tho
Is this a safe space?....
I'll have to give the other tracks a listen. This song isn't what I'd consider a hit. It doesn't really have any hooks except maybe the "down, down, down" part. What's good about it... It's original but it's forgettable. I'd like to hear something more melodic with more emotional expression.
❤❤❤❤👑👑👑🐝🔥🔥🔥
Nope that is not country.  Hate it
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS...her other song 16 Carriage will have to grow on me. This song shouldn't surprise anyone. She's from Texas. She already told yall in Formation "They can't take the country out me. I got hot sauce in my bag swag."
Not video she should have gone with ...
What the in the ai generated video shit was that
Kinda like Bud Lite and ... well,  you know how that went. Not a good fit. 😕
I like it. I didn't know if I would. But I like all kinds of music.
Perfect ❤❤❤❤❤❤
WOW, How impressive you are lady !!!! Country radio should be all over this, without a doubt , 16 Carriages also , and top 40 should be on 16 !!!! Just so impressive, knew you had it in you years ago when you did Daddies Lessons and you look, well, NUFF SAID !!!!
She’s a woman singing country who cares about her race? Love her and she did an amazing job. we don’t have to point out that she’s black singing country
Dem going Rep. Vote 2024. As long not Veto 2024.
I love this!!❤
Vcs precisam usar do capitalismo pra alguma coisa! Cadê a continuação de telefone? Queremos isso! Queremos as duas divas juntas num fit icônico! E sim esse post é em português!
We need music videos for the singles!
The outfit doesn't scream Courtney
Oh yeah, gitty up 🎉
Most fans of country music enjoy it because there's no explicit language or oversexualization and it's safe to play at your job or in the car for people that have kids instead of saying a country radio station is biased towards Beyoncé because she's black you should think about it from their perspective.
As a country music fan since the eighties, I’m not sure how I feel about this song. She is country music like Taylor Swift is country music. Country music has changed a lot and if she was looking for a crossover, I suppose this would fit in with the country music of today. Beyoncé is not someone I usually listen but I recognize she has a beautiful and powerful voice. This song is more country pop than country.
No. This sounds like a karaoke performance. Her voice ain’t for country music. Leave it to the experts.
This is garbage
Notice the difference in the amount of views the acapala video got vs the one with her almost naked. If you are confident in making good music you dont have to trick people into tuning in. This doesnt sound like country to me though. Still very poppy.
This is the farthest thing from country lmao
Please stop this. Youre barely good at RnB/Pop
🤢yuck...and so trashy
I'm not a major fan of Beyonce I've only ever liked a select few of her music but I absolutely love this one. It has that retro country vibe while feeling very current
She had to remind them who made country music and rock and roll stop playing with us and sit down somewhere...
If this is considered “country”… this is f’n garbage. I hope I never have to hear this ever again.
BRB gonna go get my boots and my 10-gallon hat! 🤠❤
And she had to expose major boobs becauae?
Doing my lil dancey danxe tf
She almost looks white 😻
Sound better then the country stars
0:41 não sei porque, mas toda vez que eu escuto essa parte eu lembro de O Mágico de Oz. Sei que não tem nada haver, mas eu associei logo na primeira ouvida
Yeah, this ain't country. Sounds like a pop song trying to be something it ain't
Is that all she does the whole video?
Beyoncé finally getting her AOTY from the Grammy’s next year. Watch.
Will they play it in a hip hop club? Or will we have to go to a country bar to hear it? I think because she's done so much for OUR community, any club should play it. Let us have fun and line dance in the middle of a hip hop club! We deserve that!
that is not country music
Total crap!!!!!!!!
I like this. We shine at EVERYTHING we do 🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️❤️
I’m not usually a fan of her, but Texas bring me here!!!!Thank you, Beyoncé🤎🤎
OK she got my vote I'm not a Beyonce fan but I do like this song and it's a few others I like of hers
And I thought JoLo was thirsty lmao
Produced by Raphael Saddiq
Verry good song
This song is a no for me and please tell me we're her clothes ☺️
I am sorry I love Beyonce but no and please tell me we're 👢 boots
I am usually not a fan of hers but this one is amazing song!
OMG What the fark is this? 😅 You sound like a pop singer trying to be a country singer and it's not working sorry 😂
I need the Original Video out already 😫
This shit is garbage lol
"Don't be a bih, come take it to the floor." I'm all in Beyonce
Billionaire talking about a dive bar. Now that's funny!
This song fucking sucks
The bit where she says “I’ll be damned if I can’t slow dance with you” reminds me of a song but I cannot remember what
I like it
#glam #fashion #fresh #dance🎉🎉🎉
Better than country crap music
That’s “hey Franklin” theme song in the beginning
Song would be sounding alot better with out her singing and a couple of curse words, she should stick to r& b. Not impressed.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Why does she not have a shirt on  I’m traumatized 😭😭😭
It's always been there glad she got it off her chest, she went there before with my Daddy said shoot😊
Nope..
I hope she line dances in the official video for this song.
D!MN B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....THATS ALL I CAN SAY.........MUCH LUV YONSAY.......LOL.....TIMELESS ARTIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....JAY JIGGA.....I SEE YOU........SHOUT OUT TO BABY BLUE!!!!!!!!!!.....SHOUT OUT TO HTOWN.......3RD WARD IN THE MOTHER F!CKING BUILDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Queen b did her big one with this one
This sux like she does
Beyoncé colocou silicone tá gatona ❤️🔥
This song makes me think of multiple generational history combined in one.
This is absolutely trash. 😂gag 🤣
Baphomet 🐐
Disgusting!
Welp, we're headed to country Bey! No questions here, period!🐝🐝🐝
💖💖💖🩷🤠🤠🤠💕
I like this one !
Thats a cute little song, and her voice is so rich and enjoyable in this kind of intimate, homey setting.
Did you see the unprecedented country to house piano transition???? My niggguh 😭😭😭😭😭 the blend n mashup n mix of all field of black music and it still sounds fresh n nostalgic at the same time.... Your fav could NEVA it's Queen Bey bishhhhhhh
i understand why she was with a texas style country to the grammy's , like a little promo for this new song
Pathetic Narcissistic and REDICULOUS
Lindeza 🥰👑. Israel Azevedo aqui 👑🌷
If Beyonce was born a woman, so was Tuna🐟 Turner.
OMFG....this is 100% one big piece of 💩 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nope !!!!
This is NOT country music and she needs to have some self respect and put clothes on!!!
Put some damn cloths on.  like the song and her voice but don't need to be looking like a hooker..have already had some great black country singers, Charley Price, Ray Charles, she ain't nothing new....
This is best one for the b hive fans it opens up the door 🚪 for everyone to get to enjoy country music
Country artists don’t dress up like Harlets, and put some clothes on your naked ass
Taking back POWER to where it originated from US ✊🏾✊🏾
This is nothing but a piss poor attempt to win an album of the year Grammy! I agree with Shannon Sharp! Beyoncé doesn't move the needle like Taylor Swift does. At one time she did but she's not on top anymore and everybody might as well face that.  Taylor Swift is almost 40 years old and everyone her age just about loves her and kids from 7 to 40 love her.   Beyoncé doesn't have that!  On top of that when you go to a concert, let's say Beyonce's concert, look out in the audience and tell me if you see more Caucasians or more blacks!
Country music ain’t been doing much of nothing since we left it behind..if blacks come back it will be back #1 genre again
That was a fair try. Can't replicate what you've never lived.
We are taking back what we have created , genre’s of musical art that has been stolen from us. Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry would be very proud.
Beyonce so fine
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
My 6 year old singing this word for word, and got her own line dance. 🥳🥳🥳🥳
I'm sorry but lexus? Hell naw, let me grab your white claws too 😂
This isn’t country. This is a pop song.
She don’t have nipples?
Beyonce what are you thinking you should do something else other than just you
Shots fired, country music! 🤠
Blacks need to stay out of white music.
Her Houston Texas roots came out
Pure trash. Always has been always will be.
Musique sympa mais le clip aucun effort de fournis vraiment incohérent avec le type de musique
😂😂😂😂😂
👌🏻👌🏻✅️ 💯 Name this word from me (try listening to the Holy Quran)
Baddest country singer alive
I love this
How she’s dressed in this video country music won’t go for that especially not the good ole boys of country music. But I actually like the song
Trashy. As expected
The Queen is bringing country back and im all here for it!!! 🤠🤠
Country music lovers: Old country road is not country music!  Bey: lol giddy up, b!tch
Pop culture 23: NFL plus Taylor Swift script  Beyoncé 2024: hold my red solo cup, bitch, I'mma bout to do half time.
I’m sorry but this isn’t country music. Beyoncé just leave it to Reba and Dolly.
this isnt country, this is a trap!
Where in the hell are your clothes? Smdh 🙄
FEARFUL SHE WILL TAKE OVER COUNTRY MUSIC🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 WORD TO CHARLIE PRIDE!!!
Liking the song but not feeling the video. Wish she put some Beyoncé dance on it.
It just feels like she is trying too hard.
This ain’t country. At all. And what’s with the playboy , soft porn wannabe thing?
When I heard the song I really liked it without her sexin everybody up with the visuals  she doesn't need to it's a fun song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzKNEjlwjhM
I like Beyonce, but, this video is not going to play on cmt. If you want to dress half naked, stay with your own genre. That's not being racist, that's common decency.
I'm not a Beyonce fan but I love this.. She's just working her lower register (rather than screaming at the top) and loving the banjo... Back to her roots!
Can someone tell me who's taken music history and has an understanding of music why this sounds kinda like pop to me it sounds like pop country like Taylor swift
Let start saving up my 10,000 now for my to ticket
❤🇧🇷
Anyone else hear Kelly on vocals?
Darius Rucker is  a better country artist and none of you support him bunch of fraud country fans
God please
Hits The Soul Straight up💐💐
I can't believe here i am listening to some hoedown music 😂 the racist country people must be jealous
This the hardest country song ever
Dr Evil has created a Foxxy Cleopatra fembot with gun fingers! Yeah baby yeah! Grr
One of my top 5 faves.
Not usually a fan but I love this!!!
C'est bien c'est intéressant
We want this track in rdr3
I really want to like it but it sucks mud through an old garden hose😢🤢🥶😨😱
Take it to the FLOOR ❤
Can stop to listen this song ❤
I find it comical that people are saying, "WTF! Beyonce done went country?!" They obviously must have forgotten that Beyonce is from Texas, which is the heart of country music so why wouldn't she?! 🤷🏾‍♀️❤Bey's ability to gracefully walk through doors that have previously been closed to other black  artists.
🔥 🔥🔥🤠🤠🤠
Yeah pretty good the other one sucks but this one is not bad
I don’t care what no one say this song is fire 🔥
I feel like she's trying to hypnotize me with this video😂😂
I don’t like country music but I like it when Beyoncé sings it
LMFAO
That ain't county!  😅😅😢😅      I can't with this.       It's a nope for me!
We are watching in more shock than enjoyment... And Queen B, we DON'T say "Bitch" in country music!! And FYI, with all your money your video sucks. (: Nice try though.
Nope. 😂
✌✌✌🎶🎶🎶🔝🔝🔝❤❤😘😘😘
honestly I don't like this song... Let's just get Drunk in Love
This shit is awful
This is terrible she should stay with r&b
Awww man. I was hoping it sounded like country. This just sounds like pop
❤❤❤❤
Horrrrrrible!!!!!!!🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂😂😂

Dre from swarm went up to KYKC radio station
Beyoncé doing bluegrass no doubt would be good. I'm not a fan of most post-1960s-country-or-C&W or Beyoncé. But I like this, also has subliminal shades that remind me of McCartney's 'Blackbird' and early (acoustic) stuff from Malian singer and multi-instrumentalist Ali Farka Touré (amongst others). I love hybrid music. Beyoncé going funkasonic ''Parliament' though would be hair raising. Bood Links:   Ali Farka Touré LP 'Ali Farka Touré' (1976): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgnFBlpylhA Parliament (A New Day Begins, 1967): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNCrmk0uFJA Parliament (Funky Woman, 1970): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2MHatAXdk Parliament (Little Ole Country Boy, 1970): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFNM7nG2OUQ Paul McCartney (Australia concert, 1975, restored): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zNm0I82BgQ
I’m a Country music fan. Her voice sounds good. But not a fan of the song. Maybe a different country song would work. And her outfit on this video is way to risqué for country music. My opinion.
Jump! ⚡️⚡️⚡️
This is horrible 😂
K Michelle did it first
This is about as Country as Gavin Newsom's haircut
This ain't country.   But Beyonce sounds great.  The inflections are wrong for country genre and the production, though clear and balanced, does not ring country.  Not even compared to the new country sound.  JMO  Blessings All
Jesus Christ is soon returning, be ready!!
BEYONCÉ WAS HOUSE AND NOW SHE IS COUNTRY! LOVE HER!
Nothing country about this. Ridiculous
give me a break!
Song sucks
DISGUSTING.. I think they're going to throw her right out on her ass ..
Nah this ain't it and i love this genre.
Why is nothing she shows reflecting any of her words? She's looking like a 304, but she pretends to have values
I am a Gospel Singer and this is beautiful song with a great beat.  Kudos to Queen Bee.  Amen
I like the song, but not sure of the video. There was a lot she could have done with such a great song
I can listen to this song all day… it is so beautiful 🤩 ❤❤❤
I love Beyonce but this ain't it. Hopefully the other songs are better than this love the fit tho.
So good 🤠😍
🙏🏿😘
nice song.  sh!tty video.
Stay in your lane was curious. Now just disappointed SMH
This is shameful white men already see black women as sex toys. Why couldn't she have on a cowgirl outfit setting on a horse. She is a good role model for young black girls. "SAD"
hmmm sound a bit familiar to me....hannah montana any one
its funny how she got one eye covered
Now watch how country music musicians be hating saying it’s not country!
This is NOT country music wtf
This song smells like dung
Meh.
So strange but so good !!! 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
As boiadeira n da pra encarar
This one is for the lovers and the haters.
Shame on you.
What a shit😅
This is not country music 😂 just bcause theres a banjo playing, does not make it country. Those of us who love country music are shaking our heads 🤔
Your video really is shitty!!! Give up country man, your so greedy!!!
WHAT A PIG !
This is not country this is pop country get it right 😂
Not gonna like. She still has a beautiful voice. But this is not country. Yall are fools thinking this is country. Go listen to Trisha Yearwood, Reba, The Judds, Faith Hill, Sara Evans, Kellie Pickler, Leann rimes, Joe Dee Messina, Martina McBride. Shania Twain, Patty Lovless, Lainey Wilson, Tanya Tucker, Miranda Lambert, lee ann womack. These are woman who have done it for years. Beyonce is not taken over this genre until she understands it’s not just about the cliche words or instruments. Country music comes from the soul. Its honest. It’s not about trends. If she goes back to how she sang in her destiny child days with a country feel, she could pull it off. But this ain’t it. It’s just a gimmick. Again, she can still sing like not many can. Beautiful voice. But theres no conviction. And I have not problem with Black people doing country. Darius Rucker is one of my favorite country artist.
Does she even know what a dive bar is 😂😂
Beyoncé sucks no matter what genre.
That  is one lazy video
Been a country DJ for 40 years, this ain't country. Nice song and all, just not country music. That's why country stations aren't playing it. It's for no other reason.
the bango player is Rhiannon Giddens - check her out .. beyonce wrote with Raphel saddiq and robert randolph on pedal steel.. she honored the role of black artists in country music
The ungodly amount of times I played this today
This is NOT real country music. Although I am a fan of some of Beyoncé music I don’t particularly care for this at all.
I am not feeling this video at all.
This is country music? hahahahahahaha NO WAY!
Video sucks.
This isn’t country. this is garbage
If you're a country fan, you know this is not country...
Texas baby 🤍
Hey…we have been playing around making money emulating black music for decades…now it’s reversed with regards to “our” music and why not? I would rather we celebrate our “shared” culture which actually feels more shared with moves like this…
Can't she do anything else. This is not country.
Im country and ❤️ modern country music but I can’t take these songs seriously. Is she pranking us with "Texas Hold 'Em" and "16 Carriages"???? I love her main stream stuff ( she is the queen at it) but i wont be listening to her attempt at country. For everyone one else who enjoys it “enjoy the Queen”!
MAN I'M JOOKIN LIKE A REAL COWGIRL BOUNCIN TO THE LEG SLAPPIN < CLIKIN SPOONS....you go BEYONCE👍
What’s going on?
This song is absolutely terrible. 💯
This is corny.
Say mane, wtf is this
God has gifted this lady and she did not disappoint him at all. We love you Bey :)
Who is this white lady and why is her music so bad ?
Not a fan of hers and not a fan of this. I only came because her husband made such an ass of himself at the Grammys and I thought, well, he thinks she is so much better than everyone else, let's see what her new music is all about. 😂 I am not a Taylor Swift fan either but this song, ain't it- at all. I have liked ONE song by Beyonce, out of her entire discography, "Halo". Everything else is about being some kinda fucked up in love, giving blow jobs in limos, just basic and trashy. Lame. She has a voice, doesn't know when, where and how to use it. Sad.
I like the song, it's got a catchy tune. But, I wonder why she needs to be so undressed ? I'm not prude, I fail to see the point of that 😕
She fits so well in this genre. I want way more of this.
Girl you better Boot Scoot that shit. This bout to be my summer shit.  Anyone say B not country. Don't now what a Texas bamma is. Thanks B..........We Everywhere 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hail Satan !
I fail in love with this song because I love country
This is a great song! Now you need to colab with That Mexican OT
This is trash 🗑
Not country! Doesn't look it, doesn't sound like it! Stick to what you're good at girl!
Woo ooo ❤
That Taylor swift comparisons got to her
This would have been a great opportunity due a fun community type video not this as above so below creation
It's the Down, Down, Down!!!!!❤
Paying homage to her father the devil I see
Great vibe.
@haterhoe123443
If she sang a serious country she would win over country music!
Keep streaming
no
🤠🐴👢❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🐄🤠👢🙎🏽‍♀️😍
❤🎉
Video and song suck!!!!!
Well I Live in Texas so I think it's kinda of cute.
Honestly so talented yet this video makes her look in a bad light whoever did this video really don’t know what they are doing sad to be so beautiful and be within the realm of the IlumiNATTI elites to disgrace one self soul to serving the devil so sad
Taking back our music B.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is a horrible song. 💯
Stupid song has no point stupid video over and over same thing? Beyonce trying to rule country music now? LMAO 😂😂😂WTF???
Her and her old man is gangsters they have no idea what country music's about what's the farthest Thing from Country Music that can be this is just another one of their shit shows😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
IRUU
It’s ok
Queen Beyoncé 🎉❤💥💯💖🔥❤️
Not a fan of this song but ....who cares ....its Beyonce 😊
This shit is trash and sounds nothing like country. She grew up in the City of Houston not the country side. This shit is asss
This super slutty approach is not gonna go over well with country fans. Country music is a conservative genre.
This ain’t reclaiming country for us. This is for the Bhive and crossover whites who listen to black music already. This ain’t got no guitar or banjo solo? The country we made was funky.
Put on clothes
I've heard worse attempts at "country music", that being said, this isn't bad and it is definitely a toe tapper. I'm fine hearing this on the radio. And if this get more people to be Beyoncé fans all the better, Beyoncé fans tip REALLY well so when she's in town the local transportations system workers make bank.
Clothes are overrated now. Guess so
Wow....Just imagine Beonce sang a womans vers of "Tennessee Bandy"
It would be so dope if she does a song with Valerie June! She is immensely talented and her and Bey actually resemble one another!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾
This is real music a lot of this just girls shaking ass and have nothing of substance this is so much better love this woman
Just because you add Banjos to your music doesn’t make it country 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
This ain't country.  It's Beyonce.
Such a great song ❤ haters just mad she’s taking over another genre
So funny that there are absolutely NO negative comments for this garbage, just unsubstantiated praise. Know why? Because free speech is not supported by this crew and they are all deleted just like mine will be.
This is far from taking it to the roots of Country.  Structurally speaking to the musical elements in this song relative to this genre, it's rather bland. Hopefully, this is just a toe dip for seeing if the river is receptive, with more songs diving deeper into the genres rich instrumental history, along with her lyrics that might shock a bit.  Side note: Where are the chaps and a black-brimmed, outlaw hat to go with that vest, B? The beautiful chest look is disarming, sure.  But the tilted down hat, just over the eyes look would bust any game in any saloon!
Why does Beyonce feel the need to show her private parts to get attention? Doesn't she think her music is good enough? #insecurities
I'm hit or miss on Beyonce... but I like this.
Song sucks she'll never make it as a country singer😮
Beyonce is not country fake is not country
History will record this as the straw that broke the cowboy's back. WWIII here we fkn come!
This song sucks
I stopped listening to Beyoncé, her music in the early 2000’s was delightful ❤ and now country Beyoncé 🫶🏻👌🏼
Nice
She's no stranger to country music, real ones know "Daddy Lessons" from the Lemonade album ❤❤❤
Beyonce's Fans Lets Gather here and make this song to a million 🔥🔥✌️🇿🇲🇿🇲
This is horrible
should invite lady gaga to finish "telephone"
It's trash.  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nobody said she can't make a country album she's from texas it makes sense. The Country music family is all inclusive so she will be welcomed by most ❤
She's trying something different I'm from the south and some of us don't think black people like country music. I do myself ❤
Can someone hurry up and come up with the Texas Hold ‘Em Challenge dance so I can binge watch while I listen to this song?!
This is great! Music. Just music. Very good music! I'm glad to see so someone purple  reclaiming music for purple people! 😮
Beyonce is just phenomenal.
Not interested ...stay what ur good . gwen trying to be country nope
anyone else get the urge to watch the Hannah Montana movie to dance the line dance ... this song is cute but It  just reminds me of the song and dance Miley made. Dont come for me, just saying....
Hopefully she'll make a better than this one to go with this song. It's a cite song and deserves a better video
This sucks ass 😂
I love the country song but the video could been little better but song great
Love  good fay ❤❤❤😢😅😢.
❤❤❤
It’s my 22nd birthday today.👌🏽
Catchy song
Mother is mothering 🙏🏻
ALÔ GALERA DE COWBOY! É COUNTRY!!!
She is so overrated
Awful and why that outfit and hairstyle looks like Lady Gaga
Act III... visuais Renascence/Country ❤
This definitely isn't country music.
I love it actually 😅
Bey nailed country. Every traditional element of country from the country slap base n drum the whistle and the slap bass did I say that already?! And the lyric and harmony. I’m two stepping’ right now- give me a cold beer!
This is not country.
Rock and roll, then gospel? 🙏🏼
Beyonce....beyond a singer, need I say more.
It's not terrible, but just don't fit.. I look at Beyonce a certain way, and it's not country, but hey, whatever flips your switch..
She’s a beloved of the Lord 💕💕💕🥰🙌🏼🔥
Ngl this is my new favourite song I am obsessed I have this song on repeat all day every day
This is so icky.
Kmichelle done it first and I like her songs better and her dress attire was on point. Try again Beyoncé your dress attire is not country
If you hire 100000 writers I am sure you can create new types of everyday but that does not mean you are that talented
famosa demais, como que pode?
This is giving me John from Tennessee from sway vibes this shit is trash
Well this whole thing was just sad
Awesome Love this Tune and wonderful video as being a fan and of country music  🤠🎵📹🔫❤
This song is great! I love it.
Horrible
Tem que respeitaaar que agora  ela é a divaaa do country ❤🇧🇷   arrasou garota !!💖🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷✨️
Garbage 🗑️
Beyoncé stay out of country music this is horrible. What next!
So proud ❤
Ok. I see why this song wasn't being played. You dont have to cuss when singing. Still love beyonce though.
So ya husband did a kanye for your benefit  to sell!!
Beyoncé got the blues~🤞🏽💙
Is this a joke
sorry but it's a (big) no for me
This shot horrible ! 😅😂
I’m not a fan of Beyoncé, but this song is very catchy. It’s so much better than most county that’s out there now.
This is whack....whos playing the instrument's? Who wrote the song? It wasnt Beyonce.
Go back to pop and take your crybully fans with you.
SHE DONT NEED JAYZ SHE CAN SLAY MS TAYLOR SOLI-DOLO 🧙‍♂️🪄💢TAYLAAAAAAAA BYEEEEEEEEEEE  BYEEEEEEEEEEE REMEMBER BLACK FOLK STARTED THIS ISHHHHH
Worst country song I’ve heard in a long time. Sounds like a desperate attempt to do better than Taylor Swift.
Elementary
Nose que necesitas tiene , ya ganó todo lo ganado , ay nose no lo veo
I LOVE YOU QUEEN B! every music of you is a piece of art with so much layers😍
I love this woman a very unnatural amount... Like she's just so easy to love from afar .. I cant imagine actually knowing her.. I would lose my marbles
Put a bra on.
Beyoncé TEXAS HOLD 'EM is exactly what we needed in 2024 🔥
SO BEYONCE MESMO FAZER EU OUVIR COUNTRYYYYY, MDSSSSSSSSSSS. QUE MULHER E ESSAAAAAAAAAAA?
There is nothing country about this song. Go listen to Loretta Lynn or June Carter Cash if you wanna learn what country music is.
NEWS FLASH.. PLEASE STICK TO TWERKING DON'T COME FOR COUNTRY..
Yikes! This is awful! 😳
I’m leaving this comment today so after a month or a year, when someone likes it, I get reminded of this beautiful masterpiece..
Yall some glazers frfr the song is ass i love Beyoncé she is amazing a queen but come on gotta be her worst song
Songs ok.  Video dumb as hell
Dropping too many Bs
Thats not country. Music.  An she showing more cleavage in that video.
Country music isn't for black singers
We ain’t Bee-Hive no more… we are BEE-HAW 🤠🐴🐝
Swear beyonce is beyond good in this music thing, lol, never knew country music  is this  good.
Queen Country B 🐝 Lady Genius! 💕
🤣🤣🤣
For the first time as a nigerian am loving a country song, lol, beyonce is definitely a  hard worker.
A PERFEIÇÃO AI
like the song,but she needs to put  a shirt on the message she is sending her daughter is not good you don't have to show half of your body to sale a record.
It’s ok, it just feels very forced.
Pulling a a mgk 😂
Really love the music but the clip is a real BS. Why are you neaked ?
Good song and stupid video.
Whatever she does it’ll be good. AND she’s opening doors for other Black country artists they refuse to play. They’ll play Beyoncés music or she’ll buy a country radio station and blow the whole thing wide open for our artists who’ll sing the stuff better than they do anyway! Tracey Chapman wanted to be labeled country (sounds more like a “folk” artist to me). This is just Bey’s First country song. They’ll be better and better later!
I like this a lot.
Todos comprando seus chapéus country ❤
Cool Beyonce is back!
Bom dia tudo bom ❤
This feels like a white guy rapping
The song makes me wonder if anyone involved has actually ever listened to a country song
Could have made a less boring video to this song.
Yay I like it a lot
Ummmm I was expecting cowboy boots annnnnnnd tassels, chaps....SHES FROM TEXAS....I WANNA SEE B SHOW TF OUT ON THIS SONG
❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful voice. The greatest singer, in this generation. Love it.
This can not be the video for this song. What about it is country
CULTURAL APROPRIATION. I find it offensive, this is my culture and she’s stealing it !!! #cancel Beyoncé
😍😍😍😍😍
It’s on repeat 😍😍😍🤪🤪🤪🤪
This song is good yee haw 🤠
why would u just not stay in yo lane babe
So we gon act K.Michelle ain’t been tryin to push “country music “ from jump…Bey do it now it’s a wave 😑
She doing her backup on all ranges
With any kind of music, Beyoncé  is wonderfull !
Thankyou ❤
This is about as country as a NYC taxi... lol 😂
Come to Brasil 🇧🇷 ❤
Toda diva tem a fase country kkkk. Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Miley e agr a Beyoncé
Wonder how many comments would be different if anyone else would  sing this song, esp. a white singer. Not one of her best , just a filler for gossip and bias . Just a blip in her career, nothing else. 😮
speechless❤❤❤
I’m sorry wth is this video
The song is actually horrible
Este non pode ser o vídeo oficial, por favor!! Onde está Beyoncé vestida de vaquera e bailando!? 😏 A canción é PRECIOSA pero o vídeo non pegha a bala (nunca mellor dito)
Can't wait for the live performances😍😍
This is the quality of music we missed, She reigns again 👑
This is the Beyoncé I know, love and missed 🥹🥰❤️
Based on the theme the Yellow Rose of Texas..( mulatto Blk wm) and the magic there of...taking back the Alamo. Warning a Confederate General Mexicans were planing a surprised seige.
Great song, didn't expected a song like this from her (have to admit, dont know 90% of her albums).  Nice boobs.  But what are those glasses, the snake is blocking all the vision for her left eye? 😱
Well the way pop country has went pop then why not have a Beyonce country album 🤷🏻 the pop country genre ain't country music anyway I don't think I heard any actual instruments just all studio sounds🤦🏻 I love Beyonce but this sound like cOuntry music spelled without the "O"
Heard this on the radio today and instantly loved it and looked it up when I got home. I think this Beyonce has a great future ahead of her 😁
I always love it when people take a risk and it really pays off I think Beyonce with her new country song is one of her best song/ records ever congratulations Beyonce I just love your country song !!!!
this woman never disappoints. all the love from Philippines!
It's a great song, but is the outfit really necessary?
Zo raar is dat helemaal niet, een zwarte muzikant 'doin' country'.  Denk vroeger Ray Charles, of Joe Simon, Bobby Womack. Beyoncé komt er goed mee weg. Aanstekelijk.
Nice song.  I can dig it. 💯👍❤
Taylor Swift, Pink, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, all changed music genres at one point & you didn't hear people complain. Beyonce does & they lose their minds. I wonder what the other ladies have in common? 🤔
It has no flavour. Sorry
Beyonce your summer hit have already started  beautiful country line dancing where everyone can enjoy your. Music will be your summer hit. Love you young lady.
Beyoncé has evolved like a phoenix!   🤠 She’s taking us all to the rodeo 🤠
Summer vibes ❤
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄NO🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Beautiful young lady.
I'm not a fan of Country, but this might make me like country more.
That's how you sing TS! Learn from Queen B. She might be shaking now... hahaha
It’s giving Queen queen Amanirenas 👑!! Love that she’s going back to her roots it fits her!
What a crap amateur song. Her fan base is so blind that everything she puts out is a hit. But in Nashville, this amateur piece of crap would never be released. Listen to her sing in a low key that sounds like she's struggling. Ppl nowadays really are pathetic if they think this is country.
Beyonce cover you breasts girl! DAMN!
white people crying in the comments love to see it
Naaaaah this ain't it
Nice work Bey X
This song is just so so so so so nice to listen to - cant stop listening ❤
I've never been a beyonce or country music fan but this song has me in a chokehold and I know the album will too
Once again she made the people mad about singing about being from Texas— now all of a sudden it “isn’t country” 🤷🏾‍♀️ if anyone sang this there wouldn’t be as nearly as much backlash
Wow. And it's not a positive wow.
Doesn't really sound country
Song  SUCKS!! I hope the country fans are pissed
this isnt country
She even killing it in country this woman she’s a  genius.
Not country music. Bunch of sheep
Garbage music as per usual from the Stars. All that money and zero talent. Real Speaker HaHaHaHa
Beyonce can sing any kind of song. She is on fire 🔥
Just awful
🐝 🐝 john schneider 🐝 🐝  Beehives get stingers ready
She will create a new breed of country fans but  I can’t see this attracting serious real country fans who want a classic sound and wholesome values
African country music fan in 2024😂. Beyonce, you did this one! 👏
This is awesome! If youre reading this.. you are bless and hope everything turns out for you ❤
r kelly did it better but not bad on to better things now
Ate😭😭😭
love u smmm beyoncé 🤍
absolutely obsessed with this
This song is awful... NOPE!
Best country music song I’ve ever heard
Yess it's different from my girl but I love it ❤💪🏾🔥🔥
And country music just got a whole lot better
Is the video on repeat?
Sounds like shit! You don't represent Country. Your listeners show how gullible and Nieve they are!
Nice from my ears she sounds a little like Dolly Parton ❤
😂😂😂
Wow the best to ever do it
This is  just hip hop just wrapped up differently  thats all a frigging snow job take your crap show and go home m
Why did she feel like she had to perform a Kim k photo shoot. I’ve seen way better dances and line dances on tik tok. She needs to collaborate all those amazing artists and re launch this video.  Great song
Its something, but Country it is not. 😅
Got my boots!!
This one is cool
She really wants to win a grammy of  Album of the Year Award. Even if she has to become a white lady to do it.
I wasn’t paying attention was she singing something??
This ain’t Country. Ain’t no Grammy. Lay your Mic 🎤 down down down down.
She starting a whole new revolution ❤❤❤..I'm here for this.
Lol. Terrible.
No
Another Beyoncé hittt https://youtu.be/fgnIEi664Yk?si=nfMPhTgR7Qo69i3r
More country than Dadys lessons, which reminds me of the old jazz clubs. Sounds as country as other country they play today. They will definitely be line dancing to this
Ok si now i am hookedon courtnry lol i love it B. Keep it coming  looking forward  to more music❤
She trying but that's not country
Shook, so catchy I love it!
Trash.
This song has been in my head since it came out. It’s literally been my favorite song.
🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️
STRETCH!!!!! BEY!!!! STRETCH!!!! SHOW DA WORLD ALL OF YOUR COLORS!!!!!! GO HEADT THEN!!!!❤🎉❤ HERE👏🏾 FOR👏🏾 IT👏🏾 ALL!!!!❤❤❤❤
It’s not bad but it ain’t my kind of country, that being said it’s not worse than a luke Bryan song but that ain’t real country music.
I have to guess negative reviews are being deleted.  This is the shittiest no effort song done by Beyonce and the only thing worse is the video that is on repeat to show her breasts and bang bang.
queen of music
Why is she naked.  ENOUGH of the nudity from performers.  I Don't like the song and the video sucks
OMG WoW! Lol so awesome. So out of nowhere I love it.
I wanted to like it...
Perfection ❤
I wonder how this album will go over.  It's so different from her usual, IMO.
Love the song, but come on Beyonce, put some clothes on. It won’t take away the artistry of this song
Why is she showing her breast like that
Taking country back to its roots 👏🏽👏🏽
Zydeco is still alive n well I wonder she gonna venture into it
Black Folks been country, y'all better recognize!
Who wrote this crap?!!
I'm neither a Beyonce fan, nor a country music fan. But, you got to hand to the girl, this is a straight up country song - and I like it.
Love the song. Hate the video. She looks like something out of a sci-fi movie, not country. Wish I had heard the song only on the radio.
she’s doing a huge risk. I wonder is it going to pay out in the end.
Guess the best way to get people’s attention towards the song is to be naked.
i love both songs, but i do not like the repetitive music videos… i wish she did a real life scenario
i like the music but her costume to revelling, i thought country music is likely conservative.
I’m a fan of country music.   Love it ❤
She definitely ain't got it!!! Go back to what you were singing and leave country to the country folk!
Yes, just yes!❤
🤮 Trend following, Jock riding wannabe. Overrated and over played.
Hummmm Interesting. NICE!
I like the song, but this is not a good look for her.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is country at all she needs to stop.this is nothing for nada im from the south Carolina it country here this is R&B. I never see nada in country music. This video is disrespectful for country music people. People need to look up real country music
You Go CowGurl!! ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Don't sing country stick to what you know. You will ruined your career. Let the people that know how to sing county music.
That big hoew I ever saw bad sing and song bad also  try use her body that be operations over and over she not no country sing  county girls got pride  the way she try to sing  and her clothes no country sing would wear they want to be known for the voice and that they are good person will add to pray list need Jesus from Texas don't make you country sing or  girl
Sorry this is awful. She needs to retire! I never understood the hype with this lady, she’s just average. Rihanna and Ciara makes better music!
Absolute garbage and a mockery of country music. Gtfoutta here with this mess.
I love the song.. I think its cute.. XOXO
I'm a country music skeptic. I'm white trash with a grudge. I'm ❤in it. THE REAL COUNTRY MUSIC! ALL MUSIC WAS MADE BY BKACK PEOPLE!
This is not talent, this is disgusting , trippers cover more.
I am a metal head. Never liked country and didn't care much for Beyoncé's music, BUT WHY DO I REALLY LOVE THIS?
The thing about this “country” music and real country music is that typically the artist have lived what they’re singing about and makes it very relatable to us everyday people, this is cultural appropriation
A cada curtida eu volto pra apreciar um pouco dessa obra prima ❤❤❤❤
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE LOVE this song.  I am just not a fan of the ending.  IMO it should end at the 3m 20s spot... just before it changes tempo and goes off the rails.   Then again, I'm no Beyonce and I'm definitely no rich anything but I know things.  Just putting it out there.
Take me seriously...I'm country
❤
Loooove this
What in the actual f#ck 🫥
Trying to crossover I see.....
Why does this make her more 🔥
Beyonce can do no wrong... Even with terrible music
This video gave me the feels! Well done, my idol 🙌💯
I cant say she's for country but , tjis is great for a multi fan base , she's on a great mindset for bringing in more of a fan base from all nations,  city's,  with this , she was good at what she did no doubt , just not used to B' being country,  an , not really a deep country style lady ! But congrats on the new drop B' 🎉
Country obviously aint country no more. Those who like this are certainly not country fans. Its horrible and hope to NEVER hear this song again.
Does anyone else hear Kelly in the background?
Love both of her country songs. Her first country song is a hitter, too.
Wtf
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The move to country is less of a risk than that boob tape holding up !!!  Now that's a Texas Hold 'Em 👀🤠💯👑
Country R&B
Ok I like it , I didn’t think I would. Now I do like some country music. I just don’t know I would like this song, especially hearing it for the first time. Go B zig zig in all them lanes girl😂❤
Would have like to seen a better video like her doing a dance to this song. Enjoyed the lyrics
She sicks
Don’t like the song 🫤
This is NOT country music!!!
Piece of c.rap
Sorry this is a no from me. It sounds super country generic- I don't hear Beyoncé doing country...I hear Country screwing Beyoncé.
Up your's, Beyonce! You could care less about Texas or your roots. You have turned into trash and you shame your family, your city, your state, and your country. I know where you came from. You are better than this.
Let's goooo... one step to the right... one spin to the left... 💙💙💙 a new era
Am I missing something?  Is she ever going to make a video anymore?
This is not country music.
Sounds good
I like the song but absolutely don't like the video.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ BEYONCE 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😌🔥
I wouldnt consider this country but at least she tried 😂😂
Pure brilliance❤
Trash
I'm a huge fan of country........but not this 😂😂😂😂
Getting my yee and haw ready
Escutem todos os dias para alegrar a vida ❤
Uuuhhhh uuummmm uuuhhhh.  I am shocked???  This song sounds so amazing.   WOW!!!!  I think this blew me away.   The beginning, middle, and even the ending.   WOW!!!!!     This could be one of my favorites, maybe one of my favorites of the decade.  I REALLY LOVE THE LAST MINUTE OF THE SONG WITH THE INSTRUMENTS
Yes Beyoncé breaking the molds and doin it for the culture! Musical genius ❤
Jesus chrisy is qlive he love you and gave himself a ransime for the whole eorld. Confessed ,repent of your sins and be born again in jesud christ mighty name amen.
incredible, the older she gets, the more beautiful she becomes what is her secret…
Bee/Ann/Say really hitting rock bottom. Sucky song with  with video showing her boobs in video 30-68 times (I didn’t count) Total C.R.A.P. Should have stuck with Destiny’s Child when her music was about something.
I love you beyoncé❤
Dumbest song I've ever heard.
dont exist the word “limit” on her dictionary. She is on fire!!!❤
Back to her roots. She’s from Texas and it’s always been a southern saying “don’t get above your raisin” and maybe she’s gotten to that point. Get back to what you was rasied on and never think you’re above it.
Now this is versatility!!!
I like the song but video sucks
Thumbs Up lil sis ...... Texas
Love it🔥🔥🔥
Me quedo con la música texana original. Aunque está bonita.
Not a country song
Wo🤠
what can't Beyonce do
Lemme spin you round that dance floor respectfully of course
Lets see if the Country Music world will embrace this..🫣, BLACK CULTURE IN AMERICA is BEAUTIFUL ✊🏾🇺🇲💪🏾
HORRIBLE
The firs woman of color to sing at grand Ol orpry she’s still alive lives in South Carolina https://youtu.be/ETQTDgZA9Vo?si=AVgU7gHu9_UlUlcz
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Noooooooooo !!!
Don't matter the color; it's the music that matters
Dam man!!! Shoooot  man this is what music is all about all genres 8t doesn't matter what you're known for!!!!! It's MUSIC!!!! Play and sing! play and SING 🔥✌️😎🎶✨
I didn't know she had a boob job? what else is fake?
This is not country sorry not sorry
SORRY, but you will NEVER convince me that Beyonce is "country". I could give a s**t less about country tbh, but for people to think that she is born and bred country, simply inconceivable! What, is she going to come out with some "version" of classical music and proclaim that she is a DIRECT descendant of Mozart??? Please, don't make me laugh!!!!🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's the shit ❤💝💜⚘️
I always knew that if Beyonce would ever do a country song, she would kill it.  She is killing it.  I am not a fan of Beyonce, but I like this song a lot.  You go Beyonce
When was beyonce born
HOLD EM ANGLETON TEXAS POSO SANJUAN MEXICO ASHLEY SANTOS PRESENTE JEHOVÁ 😂🎉 LET GO DANCERS ! STOP PLAYIN WITH ME
incredible song
COUNTRY LMAO. Bee the goat and showing her talent fr fr
😊
I predicted this years ago...like when she was doing 4 , and I always said she should have jazz album too cause her staccato is perfect for it
This shit sucks boooo
This shit socks booo
Beyounce, you do you yolo  Yee-haw cowgirl
Yes Texas Queen
This song is lazy and boring
Soooo just the same thing on repeat? Yeah nah. This ain't country and it ain't good 😂
This is 10000% garbage. Brainwashed fans are ruining music. This white Beyoncé is here to empty your wallets. Smarten up people.
She can have country. Truly it has sucked. Maybe she can help it.
As someone who regularly listens to country music and Queen Bey, this touches the soul a little differently. Love this.
I usually don't listen to Beyonce.
Why is she white now?
My girl is beyond talented! & anyone’s that says she’s not they are mad haters!!
TRASH!! NOT COUNTRY !!
Love it ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
beyoncé is 40K sales away from making history as the first black artist to debut at #1 with a country song. she could really make history 😭🤞🏽
Bey can do what she wants. Next rock and roll❤❤❤
If Beyonce made it I love it
Beyonce 2022 House  Beyonce 2024 Country Beyonce 2026 Rock
One thing I think pple shouldn't do is force themselves to like music or an artist just bcus they have been devoted fans for years. We all have the right to critique music were not really feeling. This is not really the Beyonce we want to hear, but many pple will argue and say its good when it may really not be. #Ijs
Umm… Pure porn.
Howdy fellow Beyhive members! 🤠 👢 💅
She has evolved for real, now where is my Whiskey?
Yesss baby 🗣️🗣️🙌🏼 we support you !
I'm not typically a fan of country music but this song is actually really good!
Thats not country....she better ask Reba McEntire for some pointers.. ijs
I love it! Way to go Beyoncé!
Go Beyoncé reclaim that great fba music!🇺🇸✊🏽
Hot garbage
@Beyonce can you have your team turn on the captions/subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing? Thank you!!
🫶🏿
Grandmother and her country music!!
I can't wait for the day some female artists find out that it's actually ok not to expose or half expose their breasts and vaginas. That it's actually possible to be modest, smart and exceptionally talented at the same time.
It's not music ,it's pornography
All good But what’s with the clothing  Can a song be sung without this kind of dressing
Great music…more clothes needed
Im a big fan of country music. This song is pretty basic. But her other one daddy lessons from lemonade is pretty legendary and sooooo under rated
You don't gotta slut yourself out like a rookie rapper you queen 👑 🐝.
I love her but I will pass on this one. and I like country music too,
Its not that good for a country song. I expect better from her.
Stay in your lane.  This is all that's needed, Beyonce a talentless hack, coming in to ruin country music.
STREAM AND PURCHASE TEXAS HOLD EM. BEYONCÉ IS ON THE VERGE OF DEBUTING AT NUMBER 1
Well, that had to be the cheapest video ever made but because she’s so hot I will watch it again. Song has an awful lot of cuss words in it for a country song to make it to the radio most country songs don’t have cussing in it but overall, I like it😊
This shit trash
So yall didn’t like daddy’s little girl? Cause that was definitely a country song 😅
Hope to hear a gospel song soon from the Queen
Boring song. She can lick Shania's boots.
First Disco/House Present Country   Act 3 must be Rock😩🥂✨
NO! 👎
This song has been stuck in my head all day, and I'm not mad.
Great I love 😍😍
Music was originated in Africa...do your research.. Everything was stolen from us....Music .. Beauty....Art... Science.. don't get it twisted...be proud that black people invented so many things from medical to science❤❤❤❤❤ I love all genres of African originated Music!!!!
Wtf is this, this is not country this is a wannabe what in the hell happen to real country music like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, George Jones and etc
She needs to make up a line dance. I like the beat.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥All I can say all held the Queen
Yeah... that's more pop country than actual country for example Lil Nas X "Old Town Road" had pop music, country rap, etc. I don't see it going to actual country radio stations
Nobody can't stop Beyonce!! She's on fire!  Go Girl!💥
This song is TRASH,TRASH,TRASH,TRASH,TRASH!!!!
Put some clothes on Girl. You don't always have to be half naked. Have some respect for  yourself.
Who ever is reading this right now I just shat my self
Country not her thang mane 😒
Could as well be topless.
It's nice seeing Beyonce try a different genre. But I don't know why she seems to think everybody wants to look at her body. Put some dang clothes on lady.
Burn this video, keep the song.
Stay on your lane, country fans will puke on this trash
I came here to not like it and now its stuck in my head. Beyonce wins.
Why the video on repeat in the beginning? Can’t show more data to the masses? Why are you hiding now? *snicker* Anyway, nice bod. Can’t wait till I get it back. Try not to torture me tonight. - Glad I was able to sing one line in there. Love to the rest of y’all from Texas, ain’t no Hollywood money running through these bones
Nice light hearted contrast to kanyes album. I like both but im a girl 💖 so I appreciate this homey feel
Terrible..
I like it!  We'll play it at the next Trail Ride....it will get out whether country music stations play it or not.
Gnt, quantas vezes essa mulher andou no video kkk to aki tentando encontrar alguma coisa diferente a cada passo.
I see lots of dancers in a bar or outside in the sunny barn or field dancing, Ford trucks, western wear with boots.🙂👀🎉 sure they'll make a line dance for this song. I like the song. Remake this video plz.
I grew up on country music and love it. I like Beyoncé. This is Beyoncé, but folks, this is NOT county music. It is a good song, but, again, NOT country. I am not a Taylor swift fan, but I will give the girl credit for not calling her music country as it clearly is not. Pop is pop and country is country.
Uh, this song sucks😂  This isn’t country. We have great black country artists that sing country and this ain’t it. Sorry Try again
❤ amei mami
I can see her in a hole on the wall bar doing the line dance amd having the time of her life.
She mad at Taylor, 😂😂😂😂😂!!!!!!
Well, this is just about the most cynical piece of crap I ever heard. "People are listening to Country music again. Country music!? WRITE ME A COUNTRY SONG, RIGHT NOW!!!"
TEXAS hoe
Country Music Awards here she comes 💎💎💎💎
My dm beagle's howling is more country than this chick's singing.... Stay in your own lane honey! 😂😂
Eh it’s ok, I love country music, but like her better in R&B/pop
how many times does have to do the same thing crap song
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Please don’t ever attempt country music again. Don’t disrespect true country fans like that. This song is crap 💩.
I stopped the song once I see that your half naked and swearing 30 seconds into the song. T-pain can do Country better than Beyonce in my opinion.
Why her video is on repeat?
I love B and this is a terrible song. It sounds like a nursery rhyme. You can’t line dance to it the beat isn’t there. Sorry B this isn’t one of my favs at all still love you though
This song sucks...no wonder they won't play it...and put some clothes on
Get it girl!! Country music needs some flavor! <3
Wtf 🤮
love it . Shows her versatility . 💯💯💯💯💯💯
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
She looks and sounds amazing 😻
My Oh My, that's a woman!
Beyonce,  It's so sad that you feel the need to dress like this to get attention, your voice is one of the best around, you don't need to go to these extremes!!  Hell ya you're sexy AF!!  But you should save that for Jay-Z, because you're special and should only be special for your husband.....
❤❤
🎉😂10🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She doesn't have to curse and be naked
wow. Ok, this might be her grammy for album of the year...
Still trying to figure out   the outfit there's a difference between being sexy and sleazy might as well be walking around with no shirt on I think that looks ridiculous she looks like she's ready to freaking jump on the stripper pole
Give me a break this isn't country and the outfit...really...your beautiful we know this....do you really have to expose your body for attention? Maybe you do because the song isn't good!
I really want to hate this...  but I can't.  ❤
It almost appears as if she did 10 seconds of video and then they just had to put it together to fill the entire song.
What a flop
poor beyonce  country radio  didnt play her son
Queen B ❤🎉
Darn B you got them with this
Honestly this song is better than what most new country artists make 😂
Looool it's not even country music it's a crappy drum machine beat with some cliche beyonce harmonies yawn 😂😂😂 😴
Wow that was bad ! So was the video- a snooze fest. Don't think she needs to bring the ranch to country either 🤷‍♀️
Why Beyonce don't wear clothes anymore.
She's,no Elle King,, but man, she is one hot momicita....
wtf is this video 🤢
NOT SOMETHING I WOULD BE WANTING TO HERE MY 9 YR OLD OR 14 YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER SINGING!!!
The ending 👍🏻
This some heat ion care get um B
This is horrible.
pure gold, as always
The Queen!
Omg I love this song and it’s fire love you Beyoncé you are my next auntie
🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫
Ew this is not country…this is pure crap
I find  it original
WTF Not my cup of tea..
No cause She bettah EAT. cuz ive been waiting for a sequel to daddy lessons for 7 years
Couldn't even listen past 20 sec...
now it's white girl?????
❤
Yes Beyoncé she is from Texas so why not try.... it's close but it's not country...  to me it has too much rhythm and soul in it
Ok, I'm feeling this, Bey!❤😊
so addicted❤
I will never be a Beyonce Supporter. If you know you know.
Trash
Please I need a video of this... PLEASE MOTHER BEE😢....WE NEED VISUALES
Not her tryna profit of the situation with texas. This song is trash.
I like country music and I like Queen B. However it doesn't have that country vibe to me.  She is very talented and rich so if a radio station doesn't play it she is still winning. Everyone else will just because who she is.
It is "NOT" interesting in the least........😶🙄😔😑
Great voice and artist, but this doesn't hit like other established country singers. The beat is just to steady it doesn't scream, get up and two step or let's grab some beer and drink, till sunrise. There's no pain in her voice like traditional women country singers. True country fans know the difference. Great song anyway. Her hard-core fans will make it pop. It's just not the country die hard listener know and love. This is more R&B
This is going to work the flexibility will offer something to fans from both sections of music as those bee hive swarm around country music...👌
She is from Louisiana
I don't get it, if she is supposed to be such a great singer, why is she always half naked in her videos?
When you get too big for your britches
I don’t care for this at all it’s not a great work of art for her. But the beehive gonna say otherwise even though they know this is terrible.
Baby You Killed This Sistaa I Love You QueenBee 😍😍
What a stupid, non talented video.
I’m 😮😮😮
Damn the gold digger has some country voice
What the fxxk is this shit???
Great song with the country flair and spice of rnb still at the end.
This shyt suckz..
Wao girl !!!!
Not my cup of tea and tits aint going to sell it for me.
Beyonce  could we  closed  her jacket . Rated x
Unless im missing the message I do not like this video at all its weird
Hey its Franklin theme song.
She sounds the same
she’s got a beautiful voice, but that was one heck of a boring video!
I love her so much, omg❤❤❤❤
Cool Song..but it could've been better
The song is ok but I am pretty sure the hits she’s getting is due to her lack of clothing.
FUCKIN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥... SHOW EM HOW IT'S DONE BEY!!!
I like country music, I like Beyonce, Race has nothing to do with it, this song is bad
Wow an embarrassment to country music lol. She tried to hit every stereotype to pander to an audience that will never have this on their playlists 😂😂.
This all the video???? Ok
I love ❤️ love ❤️ and more love❤️ Texas Hold'em. Beyonce is going bring Houston Black Rodeo to mainstream America 🇺🇸. It was really big, Houston Black Cowboy 🤠 Culture when I lived in Houston in the mid-80's
Country and Rock N Roll was created by black people that's our culture
I love it 👍🏽
Seriously, not country, and the video is just as silly. Is she trying to make fun of country music. If you have to be half naked to get people to watch you. I feel sorry for you. This song and video are both one big fat jokes. 🃏🤡
Love her but this is cultural appropriation
Not, for me.  I guess if you're not used to real country it's ok, but I'll stick to Buck Owens and Charlie Pride if it's ok with you
As a black Jamaican who's always loved country music, I'm glad I can finally sing and dance and feel normal 😂😂😂😂...whoooooo💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿
La Queen B ❤
changed the game for country music. wow!
Am I the only one who thinks this ain't it..  I mean her voice is always great but this lyrics and so.. nah
Perfeita em tudo o que se propõem a fazer.
That woooo sounds like Rick flare from wrestling
WOW so bad!!!!
This aint country
I LOVE THE SONG ❤❤❤❤❤
Just like almost every other typical modern wannabe country singer.... They wouldn't know what country music was if it slapped them in the face. Go watch some Loretta Lynn or Dolly Parton or Reba McIntyre... Then you will see what true country music sound like.
This is hilarious😂
She’s talented and beautiful. But I think I got lost trying to find my way to the lyric video because I like the song but I don’t get the vibe for the video.
Tell me you know nothing about country music without telling me you know nothing about country music. Yikes😅
THAT WAS RIDICULOUS
I like the song but the video makes no sense
It's vulgar and it sucks but don't worry we'll be forced to listen to it because of country radio stations being pressured to play it. I swear if I hear it I'll turn it off.
This is more city country then real country, but it’s really representative I’m not the biggest fan but if it’s on I might not skip.
Bey 🇧🇷 ❤❤❤
I would love to hear a gospel some time soon too.. can’t put her in a box at all..
I like it and kudos to her for doing some thing different
Nice song
why she 0,.5 nekkid?
💚🤎
KEEP STREAMING BEYHIVE!!!!
Now everyone gonna start saying they love country music.
I'm writing the stats lol  3.3million views, 161k likes in 3 days as of right now. So what's the percentage of those that viewed it liked it, 5.3 % actually liked it. Too bad we can't see the dislike count lol
Mumford and Sons called, they want their "heys" from 2013 back
A música   🎶  é demais
🚮 🗑️
It would be a good video. If she wasn’t half naked. That is not Country then. It is a disgrace to country music
Muito lindo clip 🎉 😊❤
The cowboy hat at the Grammys maths mathin 😂
Hey look, another pop star like Taylor Swift who thinks she's "country"?
I love country music, and this one is great like the other country songs;)
Loving this all the way from Brooklyn
No sorry go back to your style of music
🥱
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She always gives 💯to every project. I'll be glad to listen to the entire album.
Ima need a Beyoncé collab with Ms K Michelle and Mickey Guyton omg tat will be so phenomenal 🔥 🔥 🔥
I hate this.
After her last trash album this feels original :) and Nice
This is pure crap! Wtf horrible
magnifico
HORRIBLE
She`s been taking fashion advice from Kanye`s new wife.
She doesn’t sound country lol country music is going down.
So
Baddest Bitch on the planet and I mean that with ❤❤❤❤❤
Dats Not it...Sounds like a Rush Job...definitely got to grow on dis one.
And...that's how Virgos do it! YAAAASSSS ❤
I would love for her and Mickey Guyton to do a collab! ❤
Trash
Beyond desperate for a grammy
Toby Keith dies and this shit comes out…
This isnt country. Stop trying to mix ur beebop music with country. This is offensive. Shes half naked. Not a bit of country in this. This is black America flipping us the finger. Shes fell flat at this attempt.
Yucky.  Video is ridiculous
🥶🥶🤠🤠®️🔏
Uuuhm...no! THAT was just disgusting. She is so vain and has absolutely no right to be. I see she finally understands her regular music is crap so she headed towards the good side but she needs to keep on truckin'! Us real country folk don't want to look at whatever it is she's bringing to the table. PASS! Go back to the crap you sang before and leave country music alone. Bleh 😒
Well iv already made a line dance o this 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥 TikTik here I come babyyyyyy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am tired 😴😴😴😴 bey
You can tell she’s relying on sex to sell her song.
Why is she naked in both videos pretty much?
Men are lucky. They only have to rely on talent. They don’t have to show everything. That’s what I like about Chris Stapleton - just relies on talent and wins awards like crazy.
Nice
🤍🤍🤍🤍
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Keep it trashy Beyoncé. Don’t let us down. You guys always know how to keep things family unfriendly and pornography. 😮
Naw
That’s pretty bad …
It’s amazing Beyoncé and Post Malone have done country music better than most current country artists. Country is mostly what I listen to and this is definitely going to get her nominated for a cma
I’m hoping a Beyoncé Taylor collaboration for this country album, can’t wait 🤩
There ain’t a damn thing this woman can’t do. Add genre jumping with ease to her long list of accolades. What a stat!! 💫
Horrible-she is not country and this is just an grab at attention. Put some clothes on-sick of them all thinking they need to be naked-Kanye getting to her and hubby-jealous of Taylors fame now. People will buy any garbage.
As a black woman who listens to country music all of the time. This is disappointing 😂. I am a Beyonce fan but she should have left "country" music alone. This woman just put some country sounding instruments,put some "country" lyrics in the song and called it a country song. Meanwhile her singing voice sounds the same as if she was making an r&b album

Garbage
Very nice
I don’t like the song. Not a fan of
Keep streaming y’all let’s get B another #1 on billboard
Country music visuals are usually beautiful. This is trash!! Y’all just let her get away with anything!
She's entering "Chris Gaines" territory. She looks ridiculous. She should talk to Garth Brooks.
Lmaoooo please stick to your regular genres
Congratulations Again Beyonce you’re UNIQUE AND UNBELIEVABLE
Put some clothes on.  Jesus help😢
This is not true country. Sounds more like pop and if she really wanna get the cou try folks to listen she need to show less skin. Shes already talented but she is always super sexual. Not necessary but i guess she sold out to sell more. What a shame
Silêncio! Ela está fazendo uma reparação histórica 🙏
Maravilhosa 🎉❤
Love the song, but she doesn't need to be so racy for trolls. She's gorgeous, just do it in jeans and a t shirt!
THIS IS BLACK COUNTRY THE SLAVES WOULD BE GLAD. THIS IS WHAT BLACK COUNTRY MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE.
Boring video
Congratulations Again Beyonce you’re are the only Queen of the music industry you’re UNIQUE UNBELIEVABLE you’re one of a kind nobody can think about competing with you they’ve lost already just from thinking of competing with you it impossible for all. Congratulations Beyonce
I would guess this is more an attempt to introduce her fans to country music than to break into a new genre in hopes of owning the Country Music airwaves. I liked the songs more than expected.
BEING FROM TEXAS ..YOU TOOK TOO LONG TO DO THIS ONE THOUGH ...WE LOVE IT ❤❤AND WE LOVE YOU BE
this song is smash
This sounds like a track in an animated western movie made for kids.
Dolly Parton in disguise😀
The whistling could have been left out and the word bitch. Otherwise it’s cute.
If you can call this 'Country',  You can call it jazz, classical, gangster rap, whatever you want.. CUZ IT AIN'T.
Wear more clothes by doing that you are ruining the genre
This is not country lol
the song is country enough but her outfit leaves a great deal to be desired. If she wishes to be taken seriously as a country singer, she needs to dress appropriately. But then, she's always been near naked
Trash!
Terrible. Reach elsewhere for your relevance
This is incredible 💎 I’m more excited for this album than I was Renaissance
Y'all really out here d!k ridin'! Lmao 🤮
I can't wait to learn how to line dance!!!! I'm ready 😂
This is 🗑️
Viajo imaginando o clipe dessa música... Ela andando de cavalo num campo bem bonito
I can honestly say, this is some of the best stuff to come out from her in a long while. Just my opinion. Definitely a banger
Damn!!!!! Beyonce with the hits alway! Fire !
She try in that Way  to find the succes too , it was work for her to have succes to make afro Music and show She is Black , even She was never in Afrika
this is the actual worse thing i've ever listened to in my life.
This remind me a little of old school country... I like it! It's sassy
Uhhhh, no.  This is embarrassing.  It's obvious this woman never listens to country radio.  This sounds very dated and not produced well at all.
Over rated solo artist. Honestly hasn't been good since she broke up Destinys Child.
I am here for it. It makes me dance and feel energetic
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👑
I heard a child's voice
❤
This ain’t it Bey
.
Congratulations Again Beyonce you’re the only Queen of the music industry. Now get ready for the jealous haters who think you’re a threat to them.    Beyonce has showed up and showed out.        Does Beyonce ever rest.     UNBELIEVABLE
Thank you Beyonce 🫡. Art! ❤
Sucks.
don't care for it
I did not think she would pull this off, because we are so use to her in pop and R&B mainstream but this actually sounds nice...wow...she did it....
LAME!! What's up with this video? I SEE WHY SOME ARE TRYING TO BLOCK THIS SONG FROM THE COUNTRY WORLD! Beyonce stay in your lane, please. Geez!
Dude I barley like country music and I KEEP COMING BACK FOR THIS
Sooooo good Queen!  💖
IM HERE FOR THIS , EVEN IF I DIDN'T WANT TO.
I'm not surprised she's doing this country thing. Girl is from Houston
Hmmmm… imma have to pass on that one. 😂🤣
Nice to show young girls that you have to be naked to sell and not have a good voice. That is not country music
mad max outfit smh
Embarrassment  Too Country Music !
https://youtu.be/E5KmGUA7nrc?si=awrsodp1chZKbYNC
Wow j adore !❤
THE SONG IS TRASH.  SHE NEEDS TO STAY IN HER LANE.  BEYONCE CANNOT COMPETE WITH TAYLOR SWIFT.
Sounds good but im not sure its country...
I want to see you playing some Banjo. That would be so cool 🎉🎉
😂🗑
This has got  to be a freaking joke.
don’t attack me, but the language just isn’t necessary.  can’t we all agree on this. it’s a fun song but do a clean version.  i wouldn’t want my kids knowing the lyrics.  otherwise.  you go girl !
Hmmm not Country.
Ok for those who respect country sorry this ant country.
This is not country music. Country music died with the Shania Twain era. This R&B with a twangy sample.
Go on  come get it...yes yes 🫶🏽⚘️
This isn’t country music it sounds  nothing like it…
Lucky Luke Yonce
Horrible
The video is stupid
Bro think she hannah montana at the hoe down
Music History 101:  Country music has its root from Scottish & Irish folk music and then  being added some blues elements later.  Please stop calling country black music, that's culture appropriation!!  Also house & disco is not black music. Stop over generalizing history. Music history is more complicated than your favourite.
To the people listening to this thinking "wow this is great!" You don't know music and you don't know country.. This song is not good
This is so good. This woman has NEVER made a bad song 🎵
rhiannon giddens on the banjo!!!!!!
Hey Girl! Arent you a bit "mature" to be wearing those outfits.Damn!
It sounds like any other r&b song that she sings. This is not country and she has no idea what country is. It was so bad, she felt like she had to show her breasted area for everybody to see. Yuck
Love it
She could of done a better video with some clothes on.
This is not a Country and Westren Song, it is a Pop song.
We are literally very lucky to be alive during Beyoncé's active years. Such artistry is almost extra terrestrial.
No! This is a mess 😂
What she tryna say by this ain’t Texas?
This is absolutely disrespectful to actual country music.
Love it!!!
You go girl!!!!!!! show them haters black people loves country too. Love Beyonce ❤❤ God bless you 🙏You still the queen I'm don't listen to country but I might now. More of our people is in to it now love it. 🤗
Not even close to being good. Not country.
Not a great song at all. Sounds like fake country generic crap. She and Taylor Swift should take a hiatus from music.

gross
She's an embarrassment
Is it her on the oops?! 👀
s2
The Best at everything.  Queen  B❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ok, this is not true country (it has a country vibe), but it's literally the best thing she has done for years. Finally!
I think I just threw up in my mouth. Ridiculous her trying to compete with Taylor Swift she will never be.
It's definitely different from what we use too from Beyonce,but it's a hit and I like it. I think she should have added Garth Brooks or Tim McGraw for a more sultry sound. Yonce you got my vote 2/15/24
And this is why we protect our children from crap Like this. Tammy Wynette is spinning over in her grave. Too revealing  !
Sucks. Stick to what you do.  Your not A Darius.
Sounds like the same crap you hear from the young artist that cater to line dancers. Not my kind of Country Western music. I hope she is successful with this song but I won't be buying it.
This is the dummest shit I have ever seen! Or heard! No thanks!
This is down south all the way Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and the rest of the South 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤Queen B got this 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💯
Then she wonders why she can’t beat Taylor Swift out for album of the year, and in my opinion she never will and I’m not a Taylor Swift fan.
i feel like this song is just a long run on sentence.
Stay in your lane, Beyonce! That definitely ain't country.
AWEFUL!
Beyoncé helping to reclaim the black music genres that were literally stolen from back to us from the mainstream media is crazy !! Shout out to the other Black Country music  artist
Really love it ❤️
Furthest thing from a Beyonce fan, too high and mighty for my peasant blood and not the biggest country fan so I really hate myself for loving this song!😢
I want Adele on this album (Wild Wild West) or Chris Stapleton
This is not, country just some stupid hip-hop bullshit
Love it. It keeps growing on me everyday
Trashy
What the hell did I just listen to? It’s awful Beyoncé needs to stick with her pop music.
I don't like it 😕. The song seemed rushed with not a lot of thought to it please Mrs. Carter you're going to have to come harder than that to win dem good ole boys over.
That's not really country.  She's talented and all but... that wasn't a good song.
She's made this Tejana damn PROUD 👏🏼
No thanks.
This is straight shit, sorry excuse for country music. Probably fit in on the pop charts
What the hell is the garbage 😩😩
What I love about Taylor Swift is she doesn’t need to use sex or her body to sell her music. I guess that’s rare these days.
I’m a Fan who wouldn’t be a fan of this transition..🤍♥️🤍♥️🤍♥️🤍♥️
This reminds me of Lawrence Woods song 3 years ago Jumpin on it , check it out and tell me if Im wrong subscribe if you agree
I. LOVE THIS !!!    A JOB WELL DONE BEYONCE.   I AM FROM TEXAS ,  I KNOW HOW PEOPLE APPROACH YOU .  THEY KNEW I AM FROM TEXAS,  BECAUSE MY ACCENT AND THE WAY YOU TALK.  I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY MANY YEARS AGO.  PEOPLE WOULD SAY, THAT'S THE GAL FROM TEXAS,    LOL.  THAT'S SO FUNNY.   THIS BRINGS SO MANY GOOD MEMORIES.   I AM 74 YRS OLD NOW.   I LOVE THE WAY BEY TALKS.  SHE GOT THE TEXAS OR THE SOUTHERN DRAWL.   DON'T GET ME WRONG EVERYONE IN TEXAS DON'T HAVE IT.
😂😂😂😂😂Bahahahaha
New country music 🔥
This is not good
Yessss Queen 🐝🐝🐝
So trashy. Looks like porn.
👢👢👢👢👢👢👢
Finally a good song from her
Just stop ✋️ please
Not county this.
Será que vai ter vídeo clipe 🤔❤
LOVE THE TRACK! I'm not a big country fan, but I love the vibe, upbeat, jig!
Why is she naked ?
proper riding attire
I can two step to this song gotta give it to her she pulled it off cute lil beat with the strings
This is trash
I like it!
Her and k michelle are gems with this country thing
Beyoncé is like “no more dance choreos” bc all the ones with no choreos keep making more money” 😂😂😂😂 just stand there 😂😂😂😂
I'm down for any country music I can understand.. Go on 🐝.. Your Amazing ❤
Anyone noticed that this video starts playing from the 22nd second when you press play.? What a trick to increase views knowing views count from the 15th second. Isn’t this cheating ?
The video is stupid somg is okay
It's fine..idk what the fuss is about though..maybe alittle above average country style song.
She can sing any song.
Sure proof of lack of talent when you have to strip down .
KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON!!! THE MOST HIGH SEE YOU AS A ABOMINATION!!!  DUETERONOMY 22:5,  1 CORINTHIANS 11 :6-9. NOW THESE ARE STANDARDS FOLKS. PROVERBS 7:10,   2 KINGS 9: 30.  REVELATIONS 17:4. READ IT ALL OF YOU!!!!
Oh my God
You is woman perfect 🥰😍
She's riding the hype train. I like her music but this damn sure ain't it. Just an honest opinion. Keep grinding
Lmao
Explains why she was wearing a cowboy hat indoors throughout the whole of the Grammys haha.
God bless our Queen.
This sounds like it was made for a Lifetime Country movie. This aint country lol
❤❤❤❤ I’m in love with this!!!
CROSSING OVER AS THEY CALL IT IS JUST A RACIST AGENDA FOR DIVISIONS OF THE RACE!!!! MOST FOLLOW WHAT WE STARTED AND TOOK IT CALLING IT HEAVY METAL WELL IT STARTED WITH THE BIG BAND SWING JAZZ BLUES. YELP WE ARE THE BADEST TRIBE ON THE PLANET!!!!! ISRAELITES. WHEN YOU ALL STOP TEACHING THEM YOUR GIFTS YOU WILL SEE A CHANGE. THEY WATCH EVERYTHING WE DO WITH A JEALOUSY  THAT CANT CONTAIN. HEAR THIS SONGS OF SOLOMON 8:6. THERE IT IS!!!!
Not the greatest. She should stick to what she knows, and that ain't country!
This is the song that people are saying become a country music station won’t play is because of racism!   OH MY GOD.  It’s not because of racism, it’s not a country song,    Look Beyoncé is talented and beautiful no doubt but how many country songs is played on a hiphop station,  it will never happen but I don’t hear anyone crying racism over it
THE THINKING OF LUST IS THE PROBLEM WITH HER, SEE THE HEBREW PEOPLE BETTER CHANGE BEFORE YOUR NUMBER IS CALLED!!!!! WE KEEP THINKING BECAUSE YOU GOT MONEY YOU WILL LIVE TO BE OLD, NO MIKE & PRINCE, THE TEMPTATIONS, LEFT EYE, JACKIE WILSON, ELVIS PRESLEY, JIMI HENDRIXS, ALL DIED IN THEIR SINS NOT BEING SAVED!!!!! YOU CAN'T SERVE 2 MASTERS FOLKS!!!! MATTHEWS 6:24, LET THAT WORLD GO WITH THE DEVIL👹👺!!!! THIS KINGDOM IS FINISHED!!!!! LOOK AT THE SUPER BOWL DEAD NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD OF GOT SHOT!!!!!! REMEMBER THIS HAPPEN AT A COUNTRY CONCERT 500 GOT SHOT!!!! OCT 2017!!!!! 60 DIED!!!!!
Beyoncé ❤
Boring song and dumb video.
Lexus is about to shoot a new commercial 😊😊😊
stick to hip hop
LMFAO this is NOT country music!!!!!
The song is nice but they definitely could've kept the video loop! I expected more creativity from her and her team in that aspect!
Country album....overdue or right on time? Hmm.
This song is Sun Darts
Come on! Let’s do this Bey 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
That’s the perfect era!
🎶🍀°•°💗💖💗°•°🍀🎶
She's doing the as above, so below pose... Elias Levi and Baphomet. The covered eye symbolizes that she is subservient and a slave to the supreme commander of the material world.
Trash trash trash
This is not country 😂😂😂😂
Oh and I forgot to tell youns.  JayZ new bluegrass band.  J and the jhovas😅
Excellence respect, there is nothing that the queen can’t sing!
Ok bey 👀 the evolution. I'm tranced 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
If you think this is country music, you have never heard real country music.
What's next her cover of country boy can survive.  I would love to hear that
I think Beyonce and K. Michelle should do a song together.  To here both county music voices will be dope. 🎉
Beyoncé just saw how popular it made. Taylor swift to be into football and country music and got jealous period and I hate taylor swift
Sorry to say, not my favorite. Maybe get rid of the obsenities, put some clothes on?  Someone might buy it. It's different. Not sure country folks are ready for this type of music. Don't keep making it racial. It's not. Give it time. Good luck!  OK I listened a few more times. It's catchy and clever. Real. Beautiful voice as always!
Love you  Beyoncé
Beyonce literally knows nothing about what it means to make country music meaning where it comes from
I'm a huge fan of Daddy lessons and all the other country songs shes done, so ima love this too❤
Lord is this porn or music? Music definitely has changed.
This is trash.
Pure dooddooo
Texas baby ❤!!! Texan here❤
This shit is Franklin the Turtle theme song 😂😂
She really aint playing around 😂 she want her damn trophy
I'm not sure I like her song, doesn't quite seem country, just an attempt, but I will give the song one thing, the Visualizer is smoking as she is a beautiful, talented and sexy woman.
This is a travisty of music yuk
Stupist thing I ever heard
NOT COUNTRY!
Bless us with your art, creativity and transcending legacy! Such multifaceted artist - so many music genres, fashion, poetry, visual and motion art !!! Bravo!
This song has no rhythm.   I'm just glad it won't stick in my mind all day.
I like the song but it feels too long like it could have ended around 2 minutes
Anyone else mute the song and get busy? I mean its kinda country but i didnt hear one line about a truck or sister or god.
MANNNNN..... talk about 🔥🔥🔥🔥What I appreciate the most as a NYC guy is SOUL in this COUNTRY that makes you tap your feet and want to learn how to step to it. All and ALL... Beyonce's music is not just paying tribute to a genre that is most certanly segegated, but working to highlight just how much more alike and connected we are than separated! PURELY DIVINE! ❤‍🔥 PS. May need to head down to Houston or Nashville to learn some new moves. 🤠
This sounds more country than the newer country artists. Carrie underwood hasn’t sounded this country in a minute.
Beyonce is a musical genius
nope
This is awful. How is this “country” sounds like they put “country” words in an AI generator and it wrote the lyrics for her.
This song made me love Country music.🎉
I'm not one who normally listens to Beyonce, but I think this song fits well with modern country music. It's an enjoyable listen in my opinion. What a beautiful woman too. Wow!
This womans talent is just impeccable...she's forever evolving and breaking barriers...she's never afraid to try something new and this song is good good, happy country music. She's  creative, talented, innovative, motivated, beautiful and unapologetically herself. She's BEYONCE!!!
Boring video…same thing over and over.
That is NOT country and will never make it on the charts!  The video is more like porn.  Grateful my daughters and granddaughters are grown and don't look at her as a role model!!!
https://youtu.be/V67Mx_gu3lU?si=Fk0tUHVD65i5XEyh
Finally a song after so long  time where she really sings!! Love her voice
Country my ass all she's doing is helping destroy country music. I understand now why they refuse to play it.
It’s giving telephone but in a country way, lot of people act ii to have some collaboration including Gaga and Taylor Swift, hope it is true. #Beyhive_forever #QueenBee
This is good and it is country from Beyonce, neat
This song was written for Democrat propaganda and to make Texas a blue state. I'm joking, obviously
I love country music from George Strait to Zach Bryant this is garbage
I like both songs but I think the visual need a little more of something.  Over all good.
Just because you sing words in a Country tone about texas doesn’t make your song country lol… this is far from It
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 , first things first if you're going to sing a country song don't dress like this because you're not representing country music well !!!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Shit house.
I don't like country music, and this song hasn't changed my view of it.
My first time seeing this. We think we got a country queen bee of Texas lover her ❤❤
Come #1 🙏
Looks cheap 😮 no wonder young girls have image and eating disorders.  So full of her self
Beyonce please do a country love song with Scotty McCreery
You two-step to thi. Love it
❤
She sounds bored, which makes me bored listening
WOW❤
C&W fans don’t “slow dance,” the two step or three step and other things. Slow dancing is what one does on their wedding first dance. 🤦🏻‍♂️
To whoever is listening to this song now, wherever you are.... Sending you love, peace, healing and all good wishes. May your life be good❤
Why is she naked ?
Not Beyonce looking like my Baldurs Gate 3 character!
No. Just no..
Texas Queen!!!!!👑
She needs to stick to hip hop. I never heard a country singer say “Don’t be a bitch now.” Male of female. I’ll give her an A for effort, but D for delivery. As a former bull rider, I think I have the right to speak on the country genre. That wasn’t country; it sounded like Beyoncé trying to do country. Sorry B-Hive, but it sounds ridiculous.
Did my video have a glitch? It was the same thing over and over for the whole thing 🤷🏼‍♀️
So good it’s so cracked
Bello ❤
🚨BEYHIVE TEXAS HOLD ‘EM HAS A REAL CHANCE AT DEBUTING #1 PLEASE 🙏🏽 PURCHASE THE SONG ,WE HAVE 19 HOURS LEFT FOR THE SALES TO COUNT!!!
I might pass on this
Try again!🙄
Wow... you call this a video. I've never seen one more boring I don't think. She just stands there the whole time shooting a  fake gun and exposing her chest.  I'm not impressed at all.
Damn, reading through the comment section, Beyonce fans are wackos 👌
She don't know shit about country
What's next? Ice Cube - Snoop Dogg - Eminem - Ice Spice- taking over the GRAND OLDE OPRY!! Waiting for Dolly - Reba - Oakridge Boys to collaborate on a rap album!!! 😂😂😂
Beyonce first dive into country/grunge/rock for me was her song That's why youre beautiful (underated) and then daddy lessons. So I am looking forward to hearing more of these sounds from her.
Not country to me . 😅
Time to retire B
There’s Absolutely No Limitations, Beyoncé been exemplifying this
This is not country to me and she could use a shirt on .
Oh, trash has made it
That’s not country.   And it ain’t got nothing to do with color
Now this is what music is.
This ain’t r&b & it’s not country. A instrumental with strings don’t always make it rock or country.
❤❤❤❤❤
Cash cow Queen.... Who run the world the Carters!!!
Queen Bey, really feeling the country vibe
🙄
Trash!
Beyoncé:” here’s two new song, visualizers & lyrics videos” Beyhive:” but where’s the MV…?” Beyoncé:”😂😅😶‍🌫️🫥👀💨”
New Bee sucks more than old Bee. Hey Jay,she still isn't going to win album of the year.
🐝🤠🤳🏼 ok BEY
Great song. Boring video and does not have country vibe.
Now I can not wait for her country album. Never thought I'd ever look forward to listening to country music.
Beyonce remains the legend ❤❤❤
Beyonce County HuH?  I like it 👍
I love this so much!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Momma dance with Papa in the shed to this one
Queen B needs to grow up & start wearing somthing
Fap song
sounds like a hipster song from 2010.
How about you stay in your own lane and make pop music and stay away from Country because I’m gonna get this song banned
her country yea like perfume on a pig
Songs way better than the video. I like it.
Dumb as he**....it's a big no for me.
Giselle 😭🙏🏽🙌🏾
Where’s her bra?
I love this.  Her and Dolly.    😮possible ❤❤❤❤
Why not.    ❤❤❤❤
I love it!
Album of the year please
When is she going to put clothes on?
It sounds good. I think it would have more of an impact if she had clothes on. A little modesty goes a long way.
No Grammys for this SHT.
anyone who likes this has terrible taste in music
Can't wait
👎
She sing really good but why she's always almost naked ?
She is Ethereal
I love this song.
👎
get that 9th number 1 BEEEEEY
stream stream stream!!!!
Sounds more country than most country songs nowadays. Well written and masterfully sung. Very traditional country.
Does she have to be so sensual with every thing?
She doesn't suit country music lol
No wond 3:57 er country folk pissed. Literally half naked in fishnet, in same 15 second clip repeated ad nauseum. And. Country 3:57 music may be simplistic, but they can sing. She Houston, not Waco. Beyond is a pop star. It's ridicule by mediocre flash.
Is there nothing this woman cant do?😭😍
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great track. Now I just need her to do a cover of Tina Turners Bayou Song.
Love this song. 16 Carriages, not so much.
Country music is the highest paid genre of music there's a lot crossing over
White people are so afraid of reverse cultural appropriation it's fucking hilarious. They have been biting black arts for decades and once Bey releases a banger country-western inspired vibe every fucking Karen and Kevin wants to fucking talk about how she can't do it. Fuck this double standard bullshit. This fucking SLAPS! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Like always there isn’t one bad song even country fits her there’s nothing that women can’t sing. Wow ❤
This isn’t country 😂
This is gospel not country.
"Earned all this money but they never take the country out me." -- Beyonce
I knew something country was going with B when she's been wearing cowboy hat of late. Yaahooo
It’s regular
Brew rock pop this is pop music the cadence everything is just her pop stuff can't throw a slide guitars Pro Tools a banjo and call it country it's a parody
Completely over her next
Nonsense.  This is not country music and this video is a disgrace.  Her and her man want to "dominate other genres ".  Stuck to where you are and are successful.   Dont try to invade our world.  We have evolved beyond this crap.  Shame
Beyoncé shows she's  in a class all by herself and I love it she can do it all maybe even  Operal LOL💯😇💕
This lady has energy forever.
Hit do ano apenas
THIS ISN'T COUNTRY.
Wiki; "First produced in the 1920s, country music primarily focuses on working class Americans and blue-collar American life" So this only sounds like country music without the lyrics. Just like I though, Beyonce has no soul, as they say.
Got damnit .....I genuinely like this❤❤❤
Free the nipple.
🥴😫
Ookkayy❤
I occult symbolism is deep on this one 😂
After 20 seconds, i turned the volume down. I'll take some Charlie Pride, REAL COUNTRY MUSIC any day, all day over this.
Trash
OMB!!!! What if She has a Colab with lil Naz X???? I'd like it right in my veins please 😂
This is pure trash get this shit outta here
Guess I can’t say I don’t like country music anymore! Great tune but boy am I bummed over the gun imagery here. Seems deeply responsible to sex up the act of shooting in this day and age.
Who's next to try this junk Madona? Jus no thank you. I will stick to my pop rock or just rock.
Put some  clothes  on  some  time
'Crazy in Lust' - Beyonce' is always tops.
Ehh not really feeling the realness here.
Cringe smh
Songwriters: Beyoncé, Brian Bates, Lowell, ​bülow, Raphael Saadiq & Nathan Ferraro.
Damn
this is very disney country lol beyoncé is a smart business woman i'll say she makes music according to what's relevant
This the worse song I have ever in entire my life. This ain't no country music
😂😂 idk about this
Yasssssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My foot is tapping!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's missing something....  country soul. This is just regular Beyonce. Lexus in country music...no a Ford maybe. It's bland country music.
Pass.  I’m sorry this is not country.
On repeat
Eu tô muito texado
This isnt country, this is "i gotto compete with taylor swift" music.
Not feeling this AT alll.....
Beyonce , sempre nos surpreendendo ❤
Que musica Maravilhosa ❤
I am a fan of country music and this is not country music. This is exactly why Alan Jackson retired.
seems like a youtube short on repeat. Catchy song
Country is doing way too good right now with artist like Morgan and Luke to have this person ruin it. Stick to your genre.
This straight up the worst shit I’ve ever heard in my life
She's a Texan!
Beyonce is FROM texas and this isn't even her 1st country/country themed song. But i love seeing us reclaim our roots. Do ya thang Bey. Love ot hate her? Most of ur fave artists could NEVERRRR crossover this successfully 😂❤😝
This is okay. It will not get played on country radio unless lyrics are changed. They barely let the word ass get played. They will definitely bleep out the inappropriate words, if it does played.  Country radio is way more FAMILY oriented.
Love Rhiannon Giddens.
Sucks
Country Radio stations won't play it because it says Bitch in it to many times
She did great! I think, what do u think country fans?
🇧🇷
BEHIVE KEEP STREAMINGGGGGGGGGGG
Strange
I like it
🔥🔥🔥🔥💕
She Wildin on us in the best way 😍❤️😫
Wow!
Brilliant song first time hearing it
The more genres, the more dinero. She has an industry to support.
Country music hates this song there pissed. The urban radio stations won't play this .  TMZ ,   said  today , they didn't know what to say about this song. 😮😮😮
Definitely could have had a different visual with some black country experience…
Sad, no wonder our society is going to heck in a hand basket! Such beautiful talent wasted. But she’s making millions off y’all While our kids rot!
Like the song… too bad she dresses like a tramp from the stripper bar
This music is truly her roots, past and present. 😊 when you know your history and claim it the devil and his yt minions are angry.
Somebody tell her sex can’t sell everything
Come to BRAZIL queen
Hinoo❤❤❤
Does she have to dress so trashy. I can tell you the country music opry will not like this blatant sexuality
Queen
Hinooo
This should be the official video 😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩👌👌
This is a crappy and disgusting and insult to country music
YES!  Sounds good, Bey! 💯🎙🔥🔥
No not country. Beautiful singer but no ma'am this isn't country
https://youtu.be/9m8SCkqot1s?si=-9PeOcga6qh5df-C
😂
❤❤❤❤❤
This is probably the most country song I've heard in a long time.
She doesn't have the voice for country music 😅😅😅😅
This reminds me of Garth Brooks and the Chris Gains incident.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Pure trash!
So needed!
Take it to the flo
Jolene -ISH
You been fell off chick
I don't know why country music radio stations wouldn't play that song. I thought this song is really good. Give her a chance and give the listeners what they want.
Beyonce gone country, I have waited for this day !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Instantly fell in love with this song because of the classic country/bluegrass inspiration <3
I like this. Can't wait to see the official video.
Awesome song back to grass roots, but suprised by the video as beautiful as B is i wasnt expecting that
Let's get our girl to #1
What a dumb video but the song is fun
She has ZERO credibility in country music and TRUE country music fans will NOT accept her or her music.  This is merely pandering for downloads.  I'm sure it will be a big hit with line dancers, but no country fan is going to waste good money to see her in concert..
Thats a no for me, and not sure why the words shit and bitch are in the midst.
I don't like this at all.
This and 16 CARRIAGES videos seem lazy to me, neither song sounds country, carries a narrative, or brings her talent out.
If Beyonce wants to do blues, gospel, opera  mime, tap, step whatever,  she's going to put HER ALL IN IT! These country stations should be ashamed. There have been some country artists that have crossed over, but yet you still dropping their county songs on your station turntables.
This song is 🔥
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 love it
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝👑👑👑👑👑👑
That outfit
When I heard Bey was going to do a country album I was like 🤔but I can’t lie I’m loving this vibe. A new single then the traditional country music she’s still Beyoncé and she kept that vibe behind a country beat and still hit versatile vocals. She amazing ❤❤
I've been a fan pre-beyhive and she doesn't have to prove anything. She's doing this because it's in her. ❤❤
AYORAAAAAA!
No. Dont care for it. And this video is boring.
Typically, country music isn't my cup of tea, but this Beyoncé country line dance hit was definitely unexpected in my plans for 2024
Cultural appropriation!!!!!
It’s tough to realize that no matter the color of the artist . . . Country music triggers me.
Great music but wtf is this video
I wish she would go half naked at the time. When your are talented you don’t need to do that.
If you think this is country music, then you have NEVER listened to country music🤣😂
Well this one is way better then the 16 carriages,  that one needs to go in the trash
Love it already
Love it doesn’t matter what the haters say Woo❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She has certainly brought that certain "smut" that is typical for her genre of music.

Does she know how to play the guitar .... like  it would be fire if she could while performing the songs 😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Bruh
Loving this!!!  Keep it coming queen, do a collaboration with Kylie Minogue!!!!!!!!
This is garbage
YE BETTER OUTSTREAM THIS
Garbage
Only thing I'm upset about is the video could have been waaaaaay better. I'm not a fan but I love this song.
👎
This made me want to listen to  Carrie Underwood black  🖤
Is this really the music video? Or is it not done?
i love u bey but…
Parabéns ❣
Why the singers need to promote vulgarity, nudity all the time now. You don't need to promote nudity it you really have talent. And this song is soo stupid. Only jealousy  of taylor that she is able to do pop and country at the same time.
perfeita
No, just no 😢
Out fit needs to go !   Put some clothes on     Kids look at these videos.   Song is great but please put some clothes on
I really want to do a line dance to this! 🤠 Go Bey! ❤
I bet this video will be the next "Single Ladies" dance trend🤠 and I'm ready for it!!
soy la unica que amo esta cancionnnnnnnnnnnnnn o queeee
Those random square dancing lessons in elementary we all had to take for some reason are finally coming in handy 😂 💃🏾
Clip com senas repetitivas. Faltou criatividade? Chama Inês BR pra produzir o clip 😅😅😅😅
I'm a Texas girl and this is approved❤❤❤❤❤
Why does she have to be half naked?
Wowzers!🤓
I don't care for her politics -  But hey She Reppin TEXAS let's GO!
Beyonce is an icon but this crap sounds like a parody or spoof of country music, not country music.
Ok weird video
Yesssss ! Finally  Always thought she gon fire in county music   There it’s   Go Queen
My salvation. My one and only. My B!!!
great !!!
Respectfully, as a country fan this ain’t country. You can’t just add the right instruments and call it country.
It's not bad .. but not my type of country.. Very different.
❤😊
VAAI  Deusa Boiadeira , coloca o chapéu e cala a boca dos Racistas 🔥
This is crap! You can’t just say a couple “country” words and think it’s a great country song! Honestly seems like a mockery to me. And then a half naked video?? Why? Because you know it’s crap and sex sells. 😡
hips tiktok when i dance
this isnt country...lmfao but sure
She has a beautiful voice and it's obvious she's employed some musicians with some country credentials, but this still has too much pop to be a successful country hit. No offense meant, just my opinion. I would suggest taking a deep dive into what is popular right now, try listening to some Lainie Wilson, Carrie Underwood, or Miranda Lambert. Elle King has been a fairly successful crossover artist and would also be a good example. I happily encourage all talented singers to join the country craze and I am well aware of Beyonce's immense talent. I wish her the best in a genre that can be a tough nut to crack for crossovers.
K Michelle sounds better.
❤❤
The outfit. Geez.
Not country worthy
GREAT SONG🎶🎵🎶🎵❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯& I LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC EVERYDAY💯💯💯💯
This sounds great - okaaayyy Queen Bey ❤❤❤
Be a Ho No Mo
Wowwwwww🔥🔥🔥🔥 let's go country gal🔥🔥🔥🔥
Like it
This is all about the country dancing compatitions my grandma use to watch grown up. Square dancing to the inth degree. Wish she could see my love!
I'm so excited this album comes out on my birthday! Love the 1st 2 songs so far 😁
QUEEN ❤
Mrs. Carter….Amazing!🙏🏽🎁♥️
Cute song but it ain't country- FYI country doesn't like sleazy half outfits and cussing much.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bluegrass ?
I was skeptical....then decided I should listen to it first 😉 I really like it, love the beat.
its the franklin theme song from Nickjr
Trash 🛢️
Love it❤
Nice
I like it, it's catchy. I am old and an old country music lover.
Dn sounds a lot like a Hannah Montana song very similar
Kind of gives me red dead redemption vibes.
i love you mami ❤❤
amo muito ❤❤❤
Meh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love it 🥰 ‼️
LOVE THIS SONG!! 🎶
Wow thts just stupid real country women dnt dress like tht
It's a toe tapper!!❤
The queen is  very talented. Keep it coming B
P.U.
Queen beyonce lendaria amoooo❤❤❤😍😍
❤❤
No thank you I pass on this one
“Headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice”.   Can’t wait to tell the boys Beyoncé said something we relate to!
Lenda❤
Ugh...NO.
No. Sounds like a pop star watched a country movie and now thinks shes country. Lets just throw every cliche country thing we can into a song.
Honey too!
Not a bad country joint there!  What kind of music can Beyoncé not make?
This one sounds more country than 16 carriages.
Lolololololololo Um, Im sorry but no. And please put your cloths on. Now theyre gonna trash this
this is fucking sick
This chit is so wack she should just stay in her lane any true country fan would agree.😂
🎤😎
This styling is so 🔥 she’s like biker gangster queen
Perfeita❤😊
Garbage
It's incredible to see Beyoncé continuously push boundaries and experiment with different genres. This country sound suits her so well! Can't wait to hear more.
The is fire 🔥
Country looks good on BEY!! It’s the swag for me!
Tuning in to see what the ruckus is about. Damn! I love it!❤️
Eww. She mutton now.
She needs a song with dolly
Ridiculous selling her vocals with sex - please
Half naked and it sucks ass
She needs to rethink her outfit!! Country isn't naked!!!🤮  And it's not really a country song!! More like pop country
Hope this comes with a video and a dance cause the way the world moves now its all about what dance comes with the song, lovely song!
The layers of importance of this song surpass the surface line-dancing vibe of it. Big Salutes to digging her heels back into this space in her way & hopefully awakening a curious mind to learn more about country music roots.  For those who may or may not know,  Rhiannon Giddens rocked the banjo on this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiP8Tfa8bB8.
This is no more country music than the Beatles. Sucks ass!
Let's understand...Beyonce has been tossing in a country song in her albums over the past few years. Not overly a fan yet but this at least this is more country than Bro' Country and most of whatever else passes for "Country" these days....
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Meh.
Y'all will eat anything the industry puts out🥱.
iiiiiiHAAAAAAAAAAAAA 🤠
Song is ok but why can she & others put some clothes on?
The Legendary Queen B.❤
https://youtu.be/Y29RZpHnkq8?si=HkKzTpCAnJT3hGY3
LMAO!!! Talk about a HOEdown!!! it ain't country for sure!!
No.3 trending my Queen Beee❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is like Kurt Cobain doing rap.eww
somos seus súditos, seguiremos o seu chamado QueenB...
A MULHER VOCE É DE FATO UMA ALIENSUPERSTAR,TUDO QUE FAZ É PERFEITOOOOOO
This is the dumbest song I've heard!  This is absolutely not a country song! It's her making a caricature or stereotype of real country songs and the people who listen to them. She has no idea how to sing, and yet people think she can sing.
I listen to some country music, but I'm not not a huge fan of it . However, I've listened to  this song soooo many times. Get it Bey!!!💙💜
Outstanding
Yeah.. no. And seriously that outfit?? Not country and not even classy.
9th number one incoming!
It would be very nice if people would stop making this song a race thing. It’s a beautiful American country song sung by an American artist! That’s IT! Could we stop racially dividing in 2024 please 🥹
Wow, like this.  Not into the normal Beyoncé music, but I like this a lot. Think you can hear her voice much better, and can hear she has a lovely voice.
00:16 Great stuff, keep it up.
Ewww just stop
When she gonna do Funk? Disco 🪩? Gospel? Return to R&B? Those genres really need her!
A melhor ❤
Sucks
💃💃💃🙌🙌🙌 I will dance with YOU!!!! OoooO!!!! Thanks B! 💗
This greg  video
I have admiration for singers that can cross different music genres and pull it off.
I am here for her in this Era. 😍 love country music
I'm not a fan of Beyoncé nor country, but I came here to pay my respects to someone taking an artistic risk. It doesn't happen much.
Button your top up so you dont look trashy and indecent. Didnt your momma raise you up to act better than that???
This is not Country music and Country music is not African American music culture. Please stop this nonsense.
What is this shit?
This doesn't sound like country music.
I love the idea of listening to country music and its Bey. A new sound for my ear but a familiar iconic voice. imma bump it like hip hop and rnb 💯❤️❤️❤️
Taylor Swift is ×100 better than Beyonce

😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Alright...do you💯💯❤️
I don’t know, I feel this song is quietly mocking country music. It’s trying to be something, but it just doesn’t have the heart.
Okay!!! If they ain't line dancing and signing they hating.
Love Beyonce. But not the song.😮
This is just sad
This is not country.😕
Believe me, this gonna be number 1.
#3 trending cuz she bringing back country BEY-HAW
Our Cuff It
BOO!!!!!!!
Amei mamãe 💗💗💗
Aren't you a mother? Put some damn clothes on.
iiirraaaah 🤠🇧🇷
Beyonce dropping a full-blown Country album is a wild card. Watch out Taylor Swift😅
Beyonce fans are the dumbest in the world 😂😂😂
Definitivamente nunca decepciona ❤️
Cultural appropriation
😊
we stand with Texas
What’s wrong with her? She’s a talented woman so there is no need to dress like that 😢
Country music, blue grass music, and rock and roll music WERE ALL CREATED BY BLACK PEOPLE.  But most (white) Americans don’t know that.  Elvis Presley knew to a certain extent. He gave an interview once and when asked about rock and roll he talked about how it came from black people and being around black people when he was a kid was when he first heard it when they performed it.  I watched a documentary on the roots of those genres of music and that is how I learned that information.
Yes, rock 'n' roll has deep roots in African American music traditions and can be considered a genre that originated from black music. It emerged in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, drawing heavily from African American genres such as blues, R&B (Rhythm and Blues), gospel, and jazz. These musical forms, characterized by their use of the blues scale, call and response patterns, and distinctive rhythms, were foundational to the development of rock 'n' roll.  Artists like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe were among the pioneers of rock 'n' roll, contributing significantly to its sound, style, and evolution. Their work not only influenced the genre directly but also paved the way for subsequent generations of rock musicians of all backgrounds.  While rock 'n' roll would grow to encompass a wide range of influences and subgenres, with artists and audiences of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, its origins as a genre fundamentally tied to African American music and culture are clear. The contributions of black musicians have been essential to the development of rock 'n' roll, marking it as a genre that originated within black music traditions.
🖤🎵🎼🎶💎💯
The origins of country music are complex and multifaceted, drawing from various musical traditions. It's not accurate to categorize country music as originally "black music" in a simplistic way; however, African American musicians have played a significant and often underrecognized role in the development of the genre. The roots of country music can be traced to the folk music of various groups, including European immigrants (especially from the British Isles) and African Americans, in the rural regions of the Southern United States.  African American influences are particularly notable in the development of country music through the blues, which significantly impacted the genre's instrumental and vocal styles. The banjo, for example, an instrument central to early country music, has African origins. Moreover, the exchange of musical ideas between black and white musicians in the South contributed to the formation of the country genre.  In the early 20th century, as country music began to emerge as a distinct genre, African American contributions continued to be vital but were often marginalized or not as prominently recognized as those of white musicians. Despite this, black artists like DeFord Bailey, a pioneer harmonica player, made significant contributions to the genre. Bailey was among the first stars of the Grand Ole Opry, a key institution in country music.  Over the decades, the lines between genres have continued to blur, with artists from various backgrounds drawing inspiration from and contributing to the country music tradition. While country music has been predominantly marketed to and associated with white audiences, its origins are indeed multicultural, reflecting a complex interplay of influences that includes significant contributions from African American music and culture.
Great job
Wtf is this? This sounds nothing like Country!  I understand why they not playing this shit on the radio.
My hounds sound better chasing deer. Much rather listen to them
I love country music ❤❤❤
Bey
she is gross
Shakira „ El Jefe” is much better 😂
“The measurement of intelligence is the ability to change,” (Albert Einstein). Great move by Beyoncé switching to country. (After hearing this song I see her doing a lot better than Micheal Jordan when he switched to baseball, [although I sure gave the guy credit for trying!])
That is a big no for me... BIG no.
Country music is very racist, they will never admit it but they are. Billy Ray Cyrus got mad at Nicki Minaj for checking Miley and he said I want that Ninja Bitch to apologize. And right after that the industry turned on Nicki. Beyonce will probably expose country music for what it really is. We'll see what happens, and Oklahoma is more racist than the Deep South.
JUST LIKE TAYLOR DICKS 😮😂😂
ARMS AND CHEST HANDS DONT LIE, THATS A GRAND DECIEVER BORN MALE!! BOYONCE 😮😅😂😂😂 LUST🎉ING OVER A DUDE!! 😮😂😂😂
Eu amei 🇧🇷💛
Jay Z complaining why they never gave a Grammy  to her for the best album ,how can you win a Grammy like this,it was so childish that behaviour!😬🤮
I never disliked Beyoncé, but after hearing this song I’m officially a fan. This is great music, and proof that she’s talented enough to be diverse. This better not end up being a joke, because I’m liking it.
👏👏🇹🇷🙂👍🏼
This is actually pretty good. Back to the roots of music feel. I’m on a music class right now studying how music came to be starting in 1900 - now.
Jesus é o único que pode te trazer Salvação se você é Brasileiro,curte esse comentário 🇧🇷
This ain’t country🤮
More of this!!!
I'm all for Black people reclaiming what we've birthed.  However, why do it naked clearly we are more than the sum of our parts.
She come out with the most commercial, generic, boring material and demands a Grammy🙄🤦🏻‍♀️.
Sigh. She'll be Artist of the Year at the CMA's next year...
Baby!!! TEXAS ROOTS DALLAS TX SOUTHERN BLACK ROOTS
Bey to the rescue
2:43 💖🤯🙌
The song is garbage and so is her voice. She needs to retire
Horrific
My goodness she needs to put clothes on!
No Charlie Pryde…..
I like a lot of Beyonces music but this is just bad. Lyrics sound unauthentic and cliche. A swing and a miss.
Its good , just not Chris Stapleton Good.  Curious about the rest of the album.
I will not hear this song without hearing "hey it Franklin." Thank you tiktok
The single most over-rated singer in the business.  This isn't country at all.  She should stay in her lane.
I want to hate it but I can’t! 😅 it’s such a good song. Definitely one we can vibe too.
Junk she's amazing this is trash
Cultural appropriation cancel Beyonce!!!
Her soulful voice really riding this beat. The beat is amazing. It’s so beautiful. I have to get this album.
I love this B. You go girl👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I love me some of my queen... But what the hell is this?😂😂...I'ma act like I didn't hear this, and assume this is a mistake
❤❤❤❤
Yawn
Like her or not. It sounds good
Did she ask permission to Dolly before doing this?😂
Great song but not a fan of the  video.  Yeah she looks hot as F***. But would have rather seen some dancing.  She always has great dance moves. So hope there is a different video for this song. But really like the song.
Sounds better than most modern country songs, I'll tell you what.
Beyonce make Rock N Roll album Next Please ❤
Looking forward for the rock in roll
Love it!...Queen B
Jesus Christ is Lord
I'm delusional but what if she's hinting with her look here towards the Genre of act III (Rock), like she did in act I with hinting at the genre of act II (country ) with the cowboy hat? also if act III is rock she needs to have H.E.R. as a feature!! I'm getting ahead of myself but this is just so exciting ! shes giving us so much with this project!!!
As Above So Below.
muva!!!
Straight garbage.
A huge Nope for me.
Pop country sucks. This is peak pop country.
Sh
Act 3 will be rock and if you need a glimpse watch the flawless video
How can Beyoncé experience racism it’s unimaginable I mean she’s Beyoncé 🥺
I’d rather listen to Loretta or patsy. This shit isn’t country. Stick to pop!
We honestly don’t deserve the Queen 😢😢😢😢 is there anything she can’t do?!?  Sheesh I’m loving it. Let me get my cowboy hat and boots ready!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 tic tok where the line dance at????
Have we forgotten our little ones  are watching? Why could not the same message be done without this extreme sexual vision and profanity lyrics?  This would have increased the fan base more? I can’t enjoy this music 🎼 with my grand babies let alone show the video.  I love 💕 Beyoncé.  But, I want to share this unique crossover vision with our younger generation to appreciate her wonderful contributions to the music 🎵 industry.
This doesn’t sound good and why she got to curse.
❤❤❤❤this!!!
Yuck!
Look how much she has bleached her skin, she is desperate to be white.
This sad attempt at forcing herself onto country radio with crap song directed at TS is both a waste of everyone's time, and very embarrassing. 😂
Literally the worst song ever produced by her.. the lyrics don’t make sense.. if this is the way country is going.. count me out. Terrible
Queen B all the way ❤❤❤
A DIVA entrega sempre ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
just awful...  you were okay with your other music...just stay away from country.. its bad enough without this crap !!
Beyonce The copy/ paste queen. Steals ideas from everybody.
WOW ITS GIVING ME THE FIRST TIME I HEARD SHANIA TWAINS FEEL LIKE A WOMAN. FIRST COUNTRY SONG I LIKED AND GOT ME LIKIN THIS NEW GENRE FOR ME. I KNO THIS SONG IS GOING TO HAVE THIS SAME EFFECT ON A LOT OF THE YOUNG MUSICAL GIRLIES. THANK YOU BEYONCE ❤❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Put Tina Snow on the remix
I hate it.
B will put out anything and everyone will jump on it. Like OMG this great, and she is so talented!!!!!!  The country music category is the most racist one. Why is she trying to  break into this genre? I mean I love a sister or brother getting their money! But I aint a fan of this one. Yet, it is creative.
Wow! When I heard she was dropping my a country album, I wasn’t sure of what to expect, but this is so fun and fresh! Really makes me living in Texas 🥲. Can’t wait for the album!
❤❤❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
This shit sucks
Love it! 🧑🏾‍🌾👢👢🤠♠️♣️♥️♦️🃏
Serpent over her eye. As above so below hand signals. 😮
Stick to your genre lady. You don't do country well at all!
Why is the walk on repeat?
banjo is a black instrument :)
❤
I love this song Beyoncé did a great job 👏
It isn’t a good type of music for her to sing. Not a fan at all. I didn’t like it.
Hey its Beyonce! This Her Country Tune and these are Her Tits. Which one are We supposed to pay attention to?
For y'all talking about this hit different, follow Beyonce of the bridge when she jumps.  You don't have a mind for yourself.
Can't stop listening!
Omgggg yaaaasss queen
This doesn’t sound country lol😂
Eh. I don't like country music and this does not change my opinion. She should stick to her usual
This, ladies and gentlemen is what is true country music enthusiasts call a “poser”.
I o ve illuminati 👁️
She’s getting to be a joke
Shocking
Open yall eyes. This is a bad sign
pig legs, it's awful
I really love this 💙 I been fan of new country, and this feels like a mixture of Old & New Country. We need more versions of this. Stat!
She have been doing R&B so long I don't think the any of her music and sound anything other than R&B because this don't sound like country music
That’s not country lol
❤ Amo quando o artista se joga em novos estilos e gêneros musicais ❤
We love you Yoncé!!!!!!
.HIU.
Awful, needs to stick to what she knows.
🐝 🐝 🐝
Thats not country
Hahahahahhahahahah well benzino now what hahaha
Stick to your own music and don’t ruin country music😡
Most of yaw saying yaw like it when you really don't, but you don't want to be truthful with her, but yet yaw claim to luv her 🤔
MINHA RAINHA DO COUNTRY
Wow that girl want to kill me ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
I guess i'll be the first one to say this. This song is trash and Beyonce needs to stick to what she is good at. This song does not sound authentic at all. She really sounded like she was just doing something to see how it would turn out and it sucks! 👎
Slay Bey❤
I swear yaw will buy anything Beyonce makes,good,bad,ugly. If yaw don't tell the truth the bill boards will reflect yawz lie.
It’s what many music artists are doing now, across genres. Duh.  People don’t really watch full videos anymore like we used to.
Umm nope. Just stop it. Now it just ridiculous.
Well like I said, don’t listen to it. Some people genuinely love her new music. Some people don’t want to get the same type of songs over and over. Some people evolve. It’s what humans are meant to do.
This song is straight shit🚮🚮🚮
This is fucking worse than Luke Bryan calling himself country
Hard Pass.......
Virando cowboy por causa da Beyoncé
Queen of music 👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽🐝🐝🐝🐝
Beyonce is obviously talented but c'mon she could fart in a paper bag and there would be someone somewhere claiming that she is redefining and reclaiming this that or the other, while pushing boundaries and breaking borders. 😑
Beyonce going to turn my ass into a country music fan. Can't wait to hear what she does with this!
I GOTTA REMIX THIS ONE ASAP
Why!!!! think its time to stay home with the kids or take a mental health year WOO
I really hope Rock and Roll is next. She drop a clue with Chuck berry Maybelline playing on the radio of the billboard clip. God I hope sooooo ❤
I predict that in this album she's gonna have a feauturing with gaga
Lived all my life thinking she was white!
Boring money grab.
Any fan of Beyonce who enjoys this song but doesn't typically enjoy country music has.....shall we say.....issues. Because she has indeed made a typical country record....no better or worse....than most anything country.
No. Just no
She said. I am coming for everything they took from us😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
And this vid and the other vid to her “country” music is lame! Same thing over and over. Can she not bounce anymore? Her knees hurting her? I guess that’s why she went country so she can just stand there and sing. She getting old and the bouncing has gotten to her!
Country music STARS wear clothes! STILL NOT GOING TO WIN ALBUM OF THE YEAR!
The beat is country The lyrics might be country  But the voice isn't at all country.   I'm for crossovers, maybe next song.
I like this and 16. And I CANNOT WAIT to see how country music treats the Queen. It’s gonna be verrrrry interesting as the powers that be IMMEDIATELY put the 2 COUNTRY RECORDS under Pop upon their release. It’s since been moved to country….but the play was attempted off rip. Stay tuned!
Sounds like Jessica Simpson song the boots
I dunno about this one 😅
Nothing less than a black version of Madonna
I like it...can't wait to see the line dance
I've been waiting for this since she did daddy lessons, I just knew she would eventually do something country
Nothing against her but I just don’t care for it. And believe me there is a lot of pop country that I don’t like from dozens of other artists. *edit* sjw it has nothing to do with race or sex just don’t care for this particular song. I love some of her older stuff. Carry on BEE
What the hell was this?
black people invented country music btw ! its a form of rock n roll which is inspired by mexican culture… colonizers have taken this too and ruined so glad black artists are taking this genre back
This is trash. Put on jimmie rodgers, hank williams sr, waylon jennings and dac, thats country
I hope this doesnt age badly, but im very optimistic that she will win album of the year with this
No one needs to see the out line of your boobs at this point in your career.
When you say …. With cheeeeewww in a song ITS NOT COUNTRY!   This song is terrible !
😂😂
Focusing on white people ... Smart move but still have a demon inside of her. If she believed in good and about God, she would of preached it at least once.
this is awful. so obvious she didnt write it. she does not have a country voice. plus she is mega famous why does she have to put her tits out there for attention? isnt her status well above that or is her fame level dropping?
The events happening in this song in emoji's   🪕😙🎴🚘🔑🌪️🥃🤠💃🌡️🔥🧊👏🏻👢🥾🔫📸💁🏻‍♀️  😁
Estou indo a loucura ❤❤❤🎉
Porcaria genérica
Just not impressed and I've never heard ANY music I didn't like! From Hank Sr. to Bradley Gilbert to Frank Sinatra to Billie Holiday!
Ela teve um sonho de chapéu e bota de piton 👨🏼‍🌾
Can’t get this song outta my head, I feel like line dancing lol ❤
🇨🇱
Well she is not a country singer....she needs to sing what she is good at...and this is not it ..sorry folks this is bubble gum stuff This is like Dolly trying to do rock music...it didn't work for her either....when God gives you a gift of a beautiful music....you don't need to cuss .... dress obscenely.  What ever happened to the good old country music
Oh, and you're not Taylor!
Just bc you talk about country stuff does not make it country!
❤🎧❤
WOW, love the creativity...? And her voice IS NOT country!
So this is fine but my favourite YouTuber can't say fuck?
TRASHY!
Okay love the outfit, cept the weird glasses and the chopped trucker coat…..shoulda just had some sharp shades and a leather and denim coat
Wouldn't mind it, minus the cuss word and her being practically nude in the video, lets just stop trying to make country different music then its meant to be....
I can't believe how much I love this song ❤
Nice. Cut time crap R&B profanity.
Foul lyrics and the beginning sounds exactly like "Redneck Woman."  Go away, Beyonce.  Country music doesn't need trash.
This song is sooooo dope! As a BLACK country-boy from Sc i approve this song!!!
Oh but it's ok for all the white artists who want to sing black artists songs, dance like them and dress like black artists.  WTF🤬
Bring Texas back❤
yes lol happy valentines beautiful xxx love the song yes xx
Lol, she can't sing, in any genre
✨shit no one asked for✨
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Bey did it again 🎉
Not country. But has the theme lol
Is this a joke? I'm bad at sarcasm.
I’m obsessed
I grew up on Country Music! I have witnessed every evolution of Country music to include Today's Country! I DON'T know WTF This is Not Country Music Though!
Fair.  Best part is the banjo.
Great song indeed
I'd love to here her voice doing gospel I like this from her we already know she doesn't put out crap although this ain't traditional country it's just as good as any of that pop country that's out right now
This is song  is amazing ❤
<3 <3
thank you bey for giving me this gem❤❤❤
I give her major props for trying a brand new genre 🎉🎉
I REPEAT, SHE IS A PERFECT, I LOVE HER SO MUCH ❤❤
This is not country, not even country pop.....if there's such a thing!!!! Stick to what you  know.....this is not it!!!! And if you think you need to dress like that to be country, lady you know nothing about being country or country music.
ATEEEEEE 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Was never a fan, but I must give credit where it’s due, she nailed it. It’s tight.
I don't like it.
Go sis!!!
Beyonce ... you will take it all if you did a Jazz project singing the songs of female jazz greats of old. Billie, Ella, Shirley Horn .... and get rid of those played-out leotards.
Absoulutelr horrible.put some damm clothes on.don’t bring your hip hop R&B wardrobe to country.
Stick around 🐴
Bey forever young 😊
💖💖💯💯
This is not country but Pop with country element
I don't like it but to each their own
TEXAS HOLD ‘EM Beyoncé  This ain't Texas (Woo), ain't no hold 'em (Hey) So lay your cards down, down, down, down So park your Lexus (Woo) And throw your keys up (Hey) Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Stick around)  And I'll be damned if I can't slow dance with you Come pour some sugar on me, honey too It's a real life boogie and a real life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now (Woo)  There's a tornado (There's a tornado) in my city (In my city) In the basement (In the basement) that shit ain't pretty (Shit ain't pretty) Rugged whiskey (Rugged whiskey) 'cause we survivin' ('Cause we survivin') Off red cup kisses Sweet redemption, passin' time, yeah  Ooh, one step to the right We headin' to the dive bar we always thought was nice Ooh, run me to the left Then spin me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind  This ain't Texas (Woo), ain't no hold 'em (Hey) So lay your cards down, down, down, down So park your Lexus (Woo) And throw your keys up (Hey) Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Stick around)  And I'll be damned if I can't slow dance with you Come and pour some sugar on me, honey too It's a real life boogie and a real life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now (Woo)  And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you Come and pour some liquor on me, honey too It's a real life boogie and a real life hoedown Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now (Woo)  Woo-hoo Woo-hoo Woo-hoo
As a long time county fanI love it.  Far better than most of the current country crap being played. This can only be good for country music. Would love to hear the backstory about the genesis of the idea to do this.
This song is fn terrible
This just isn't very good. What's with all the swearing? I mean I know she didn't write it because she's not very talented, she just has good tone to sing other people's creations, but this is just the corniest thing I've ever heard. You can't just play dress up and claim to be country. It's just embarrassing.
It's giving Lady Gaga interludes.STOP STEALING FROM PEOPLE 😒
I’m a huge fan of traditional country music. This music video sucks, song will be a great line dancing song. I look forward to listening to the rest of the album.
Always soo beautiful 🥰🥰
Beyonce Get T pain to write your country music
🗑️
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Beyoncé understood the assignment, country music is about story telling. She did an amazing job with this song them white folks are mad they stole the genre from African Americans and now she bringing it back home.
Definitely different.  I am not sure if I like the song, but I DEFINITELY LOVE THE INSTRUMENTS.
OMG! LOVE IT!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What an incredible feat for the GOAT Queen.  Much respect
BORING!!!

Yesssss queen B!!!
Even when she's promoting a country album, she has to dress like a stripper? If she can't rely on her talent instead of sell everything with her body/looks, she's not going to handle it well when she gets older and things start to sag.
🎵🎵🎵
I am 75 yrs old and grew up on country music. I feel like she is making fun of me and all those that love it. Also she needs to put some clothes on to sing country. Just my opinion.
👎🏾
Disgusting.  Get off the stage.  Booooooo
Texas, show 'em! Bey just made me a country fan. Would never have guessed in a million years. Love you for life, legend.
Who cares about my comment  now....hahahaha
Well the song at least has two things going for it.
She got the worst voice ever , why she famous ?
Love it and shout out to the West and Central Africans and our  ancestors,descendants for creating the Banjo! Great job on Banjo Rhiannon Giddens!!! 🎼❤
Love it u rock
😦🤯😍
She sounds like Dolly, but still sounds great.
I am not a Beyonce fan, but this music is nice. ❤
She put a country instrumental behind her r&b voice. I was hoping for a little twang in her voice. Yall hyped it up and it just doesn't match to me...
Quem tá amando a fase boiadeira da Queen B ? Eu tô amando ❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Another a Hit😊
Chef's  kiss. 💋  love how you kick through boundaries with the power of your beautiful voice.
Honest assessment, I’ll pass, but looks like she had fun doing it and it was well put together just not my sound
Im not a country fan but i love this song.
This *ain't* a country song?! Says who, the magat patrol?! 🤔
❤❤❤❤. Great vibe .
Beyoncé Legend Knowles strikes again !
a video with no concept 🥱👎🏼
Amei ❤viciada
Beyoncé on Taylor turf and she delivered ❤
Wtf 😒 Beyonce No .. I'm not a country person but this not for me.. she's not getting my money so 😅 her dangerously in love " B'day" and Sasha fierce is my favorite.. 😊 let the Real country singer be country.. don't need to fit in for attention 😅
Porn music. And fake blonde. The same racism
porra de novo sem clipes?
Check out my remix of 16 Carriages https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ6Li6sG_H8
Satan worshipper What about the island?
Time to make Beyoncé number 1. They gon learn today sis.
Never listened to Beyonce before. I mostly listen to all kind of music. But I guess I will keep my old attitudes.
Beyoncé, a wanna be poser...no country star here!!! Just seems like Beyoncé and Kanye are just trying to mock Taylor Swift and good ol country music here! Trashy!!!
❤ I love this song this is Texas makes me want to go to Texas and buy a house. I love this song.
I'm definitely not a country music fan & listen to Jazz & not Beyonce but l like this s**t alot.
NO WAY, Beyonce there are better country and western singer's out there that have a better beat and vocals.
Absolute shit... 💩🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
🤡🌏🥴🥴
Nope
LOVE THIS
Noooooo
Well guess it’s time to get into country frfr
That's how you celebrate Black History month! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Keep 'em mad. ❤
The song is pretty good but the video sucks...it's just the same thing like 45  times  ??
Mazza L20 out now https://youtu.be/4OkL9USaoCI?si=KORrQ4Fgj5JLrQl_
Oh this sucks!
"E disse-lhes A Senhora: "Que haja o Country" e assim se fez . E tendo o criado viu que era bom.        Renascença, Capítulo 2, Versículo 1
Showing people how it's done
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Love it
She doesn't sound like a country singer.
I like this song❤ but not the clip 😢
She wanted be c ountry. Didnt like it.
Apparently the songs r being blackballed on radio. Why is America so racist
I like the song but i'm so disappointed how ordinary Beyonce portraits herself. She's an icon for young girls and this is the example you wanna set?
It's about time❤  now I can like country, thanks Beyonce ❣️
She's from Texas. This isn't her first country song. Artists have to keep evolving. 2million views in two days. Glad the world is this kind of place, where artist can grow and still find an audience for their work. Wishing her success in all ventures.
Announce the Tour ❤
These comments fail lmao- this is crap
What's crazy is that now that other artists (like Ariana Grande) are starting to take a ride on the whole movement that was act i reviving ballroom music, Bey comes out and says: alright, ballroom's over, now country is the new thing 🤣
This ain't texas and it ain't country. But it is awful.
Yesss I can’t wait to dance to this!!!❤❤❤
Song meh..video sucks.
Beyonce surprises with this country style.  Great song!!! She actually always stood for a classy and sexy style. This outfit is just trash.
RESPEITA A MULHER❤
Its a trash song
Sorry I fell asleep listening to it.
Love it❤❤❤❤
Disgusting go raise your kids and enjoy your rich life please they won't even play your songs on the radio 😆😆😆
LOVE IT....
Bout to go get me hat and some cowboy boots 💃🏽💖🪕
I don't know any half  naked country singers..sorry b...kids are watching
Wtf is this
This song is truly AMAZING, way to go Bey
Top
She’s taking it
Hott
Finally, a Beyonce song with a melody.
Why does this remind of Jessica Simpson, boots made for walking, lol?
Eh
Wassup guys! I’m 24 year old rapper. Do I have potential to make it big. Can y’all judge my song “Changes”
😂😂😂😂 I cant
The white ppl are so mad in the comments lol…….. we love to see it! ✊🏾
Beyoncé has gone folk
We need a line dance ! Beyhive assemble 💃🏽
😭
Love it Beyoncé. Do-si-do🔥💕
Love it ❤
Good song don't care for the video.
Kane brown what if ???
She been awfull for about 5-7 years but this brought her back lol
👍
Good on you for still innovating and breaking ground, looking forward to the album. Strap them boots on and walk over all them haters. Will always support your music, even if you decide to do K-Pop next!
this was the combo i didnt know i needed, becountré!
✨👀🥰👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽🥰🙏🏽Thank You Beyoncé🌹💖💖🙏🏽🥰👋🏽👋🏽💕💕✨
Trash
Where are 'em nipples
This is actually good and just in time for Rodeo.
Love Love it 💃💃❤
IF JAY Z CAN BAG THIS WOMAN THERES HOPE FOR US ALL
<3 <3 <3
This is fucking garbage. It's not even a little good
I don’t care anymore, B is going to be considered as the greatest female artist of music history after she done with her things.  This is glorious and i was not a fan before last album.
This is not country music , but ok
Yo this is amazing & different for the Forever Evolving Queen Bey
Mama use to Say! Change the Game and that's whats up! Yippie Ki Yay BarBey! A Bey Bey!
This is different. I like it!!!❤
So thankful that this queen is back.
ON REPEAT QUEEN ⚡JUST CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THE WHOLE NEW ACT II
She is the best 🖤.
She is doing the Baphomet symbol over and over again in this video with two fingers up in two fingers down this is classic with one I covered, she is leading all of your souls  to hell
It’s r&c. Rhythm and country.
FACTS by tom macdonald and ben shapiro is better than this
Dolly we love you but   here comes Beyoncé !! Yeehawwwww .Don’t mess with Texas y’all !
Imagine being banned by stations for making a style of music your culture created by ppl who appropriated and act as if they own it 😑🤨
Love this never except this form her
nice
That was cute!  I like that! 💛💛
It seems most of yall are blind this isnt an mv its a visualizer. if u dont like it, step out
Interesting! I’ve been listening to Beyonce for years even when she was with Destiny’s Child I have to say I’ve never seen this side of her before loooove it!
Texas bey
Ok, I'm obsessed, it reminds me of the beginnings of Carrie Underwood 😍
Baby going to go buy me a cowgirl hat and some cowgirl boots immediately
Love it
What a STUPID video. You’re a bazillionaire. This is the best you can do? Was there some point in repeating the same clip over and over again that I am too obtuse to understand?
I like country music now!!
Tacky outfit. Why?!?
Just OK in my opinion
Great song but seriously do I need to see her bits NO . Makes it look like in Texas they have. Shooting  tacky woman .  😎
Had this on repeat all day yesterday. Not a Beyonce fan - but can appreciate her talent and vision - but love her vocals/lyrics and this track. Already a smash.
Naked
Yes go Beyonce great song. Texas Hold'em is a good song. I like it listening on Wed. 2-14-2024.
Song is cool minus the curse words as YOU SHOULD BE MARKETING EVERYONE.. Video is 🗑️ because she comes off super goofy with the lyrics but the melody cool
Girl u got that whole comment from the breakfast club
I wish you did your own linedance for us to do for this song like how Victoria Monet did for On My Momma
Very interesting no offense but she has an r&b voice how can she pull a who 360 and change genres. Not sure about this 1 but all the best. Good luck.
This is about as country as anything coming out of Nashville these days 😂
❤
BEYONCE is something else.  This song is🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don’t have a problem with her but this song is mediocre at best and the video is stupid apparently Texas is a strip club with strippers that can shoot fire out their fingers… actually on second thought Texas sounds pretty rad now😂
Calling Carrie Underwood, Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, Dolly Parton,  Cowboy Troy, somebody who knows country music, please help the B ASAP
It's about time. I've said for years (early DC days) since I first heard her sing and speak that she could sing country because she's always had a country accent. That's why they gave her media training and she usually takes her time speaking in interviews and speeches so it's not so pronounced. It comes through in her singing too with the slight yodels that she does. This is no shade...so please  Beehive stay at bay lol. Its like she could've cashed in a long time ago on this and also helped other AfricanAmericans breakout in the genre sooner like Mickey Guyton and Darius Rucker.  Both had a hard time and fight to get taken seriously and get "in" to the "country club." Just like K. Michelle she's been working on her country album for about 3+ years because she said they were blocking her and no country producers took her serious and wanted to work with her. And she's from Tennessee.  I like both singles, they sound good, hope this will  help more African Americans break in now that Bey is doing it. Much love❤😊
This is the music that plays when you hit the 256th level of PAC-Man. Everything goes haywire, and it glitches. Perfect music for that.
ALL ya'll lying! This song sucks. She has done better. BUT this one is a miss, it's horrible...Now go cry me a river😂
🥂💯
RHIANNON! I'm obsessed.
Why doesnt she put clothes on? First song of hers I like.
🔥 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥 I'm a straight male and ion listen to Beyonce or country much but ts hard she definitely reclaiming the thrown
Country music isn't for her  but pretty voice ...

I like this 🔥🔥
❤
Holy shit this is bomb
She definitely can get it 🍑
Country music has always been in her cards . She just showing a glimpse of her hand 🥰 Go Queen !
This is how my mom Beyonce outdoes Lemonade and Renaissance
Brilliant!!!
Queen Beyoncé
Sucks 😢
R✨A✨N✨G✨E
❤❤❤❤
Love this track just like Daddy Lessons! Want more of this from Bey
This aint country
Great mix....wow Bey!
This is just as Country as Lyle Lovett or Mary Chapin Carpenter or many of the Country artists that have made it the last 30 years.  The stations that are refusing to play this ought to be embarrassed.  Tomorrow I'm going in to my favorite bar. And playing this on the jukebox.
Seriously yall needs your books checked , it dont sound right
Great video, the same 5 seconds over and over. WTF?
When do Beyoncé and Lady Gaga get together for another telephone?!
I am sorry, but I am literally having a meltdown at how much of a genre shift this is, how much I fucking love this song, and how this sounds perfectly like a classic Beyoncé hit. My personal earth has been shattered. Great track!
Yall do know there are black country artists she just wana try to get a hit like that lil nas bullx but i guess black folk will need their own  category now black folk always want to be in their own class or treated separately then complain when they aint included... ridiculous
This is cool…as an R&B and Hip Hop lover, I tend to appreciate sounds like Miranda Lambert, The Band Perry, Mums and Sons of course Chris Stapleton, etc…this probably has to grow on me but it sounds nice
So being naked every chance you get is what you call authentic black country? This song without any message or depth, generic Beyonce music.. impresses a lot of naive people out there. Thanks, I prefer real country.
eww
Would love for a duet with Darius Rucker
Girl shocks me every timeeee❤️
Ok B 👏🏾 country was our first so go get it! But we getting older change the wardrobe please u need clothes to be the example to the younger ladies out here 🤦🏾‍♀️ u a wife ijs wives don’t dress like this onky for our man I won’t really listen to this not my type but she sound 👍🏾 good 💕 not a hater at all so it ma jus dress ur age please and as a wife
BITCH yes!!!! 👑🐝
Are you kidding me....that's the worse country I've ever heard. And wth kind of video is that? This tramp needs to stay in her lane.
Always gotta play the hooker.
Love this❤
Bey has the perfect voice to ride any beat
I like the song but what a wasted video.  The same move over and over and over.  It's a waste of time to watch.  She has always sold soft porn and that is not a judgment it is just a fact.  just look at her other videos.  If you have nothing to sell you sell sex, according to one advertiser I knew.  And this proves that.
666 image subliminal
Needs more clothes.
Great music, she is fantastic. But the video sucks
Bey said okay now make it CUNTRY, hunny!
Taylor Swift watching this like This bitch here in my street 😭😭😭
The Texas in her is coming out, way to show us your roots bb girl Beyoncé👑
K michelle somewhere pounding the wall
👍👍👍
Marcy Marcella was here
Reyna Roberts sounds way better than you😂 Her voice was made for country and she can actually sing!
NO just NO God help her
Put some darn clothes on
Eh
Why no shirt?
Sorry nope not for me  but she will fit in with the others in country
I'm having Last Song Syndrome with this song! Beyonce is still Kween...and she can sing any genre
Not really my vibe
WAIT A MINUTE… are we listening to the same song. Are we judging the vocals or what she is trying to present in her videos… not one time have I had came across a musician trying to caress herself and present herself as a stripper to get positive feedback and comments. Her vocals suck, the song sucks, and her video sucks!!! Let’s Beyoncé I understand why she may went out of space (aka Super Bowl 2024 commercial) thinking she could do any kind of musician platform but it shows she can’t and needs to be put back in her place. Come back to earth Beyoncé…
🤷🏾‍♂️meh...🤷🏾‍♂️
wow got to find me a cowgirl! awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow this is BAD!!!
Still RNB
I love it
Wow she's really showing her Witchcraft and Illuminati symbols.  She won't be played on country radio for sure..  trying to bring that bad stuff into country 😅
That's why she's Queen Bey..gassed up listening    to this on repeat
*Holy shit, i clicked and didn't realize it was Beyonce at first. God damn your hot in this visualizer.* *Bravo* 💪 Thank you for showing you have other sides of you as an American.
Low key 🗑️🗑️🗑️ this is bootleg country at best
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

The Country music is mexican.  TEXAS IS MEXICO  CALIFORNIA IS MEXICO NEW MEXICO IS MEXICO NEVADA IS MEXICO WYOMING IS MEXICO COLORADO IS MEXICO ARIZONA IS MEXICO UTAH IS MEXICO KANSAS IS MEXICO OKLAHOMA IS MEXICO  SAY IT. 🇲🇽 >>> 🇺🇸
Im not a big fan of Beyonce but I like country music: I like this song and 16 carriages.
Meh.  Love her music, this song not so much
Put some damn clothes on🙄
The music is good, but the video is tacky for the song.
TEXAS HIVE TAP IN! 🤠
It feels like a shift in music everytime she drops! Bey is iconic and a hit maker 🔥🔥🔥
Idk how J-z is ok with her wearing small pieces of clothing like what dose blue have to say to that ? We all saw how north west reacted to Kim’s outfit
This is not country music
Ouf…that’s pretty terrible…..she should have continued with Dance music, clearly.
I gotta learn the dance this!!!
i figure it could be some years until this album will be recognized as brilliant....but it's gonna happen. (spoken by a Black guy raised with far more country music than i wanted)
❤
I wanna hold em...
I don't like it
é sertaneja. e a bixinha vai ter q aceitar. vem grammy, veeeemmmmm, vem ludmilla vemmmm
Uh... no
I never love country music this much it’s been on my list roll for2days
😍😍😍
Go Bey, let's have a ho-down.
I’m feeling this.
This is Awful
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's is a sorry attempt to say the lest...don't have a good voice to begin with..then she want to dress like she in an adult x movie..she needs to step away from the mic...for real disgusting..
I can hear my ancestors saying, Beyoncé hell yeah take it back!
Jammin big time, good job B and Blue Ivory says at the end of Daddy Lesson, the best country song in my opinion.  Keep up the good work.  She talks like she is a country girl, so naturally she should crossover into country music and she is good at it too.
Jesus Beyonce doing country music is the the hat that show its gone to complete shit
It’s giving the theme song to Franklin The Turtle
The DEVIL!!!!! works harder this country album has nothing to  do with or offer to the culture hasn't  Beyonce rob the black culture enough it's a NO!!! for me 🤷
Taylor kicked her ass
Dolly smiling proudly
Am going to sit down and listening this album carefully my queen #beyonce I wanna marry you 😂😂😂😂 I don’t care what C gonna say   🏃🏻‍♂️
Ugly music stupid video clip …? Thanks for sharing buddy. Shit.( legionnaires Veterans)🇺🇸🇨🇦🇫🇷🇦🇺🇬🇧🇩🇪🙏
And just like that...I fell in love with county music ❤
She’s amazing that’s for sure but I’m not a b fan I’m being honest too girlie for me but she’s great
Hahahaha this is trash not country music
This surprised me with how good it is. She can sing whatever she wants. Props to her
Would make for one hell of a line dance..❤❤❤❤😊
Diva Bey ❤🇧🇷
Why she dressed like a prostitute but she’s married. It’s a no for me.
Garbage
Pretty awesome; was listening for some steel guitar. Great breakdown at the end.
This is a trash song.  Hate it.
Mickey Guyton deserves “country” flowers waaaay before Bey! Mickey has been fighting for a place in country for years! And she IS country! Bey is encroaching trying to get an album of the year for something out of her lane!
It's ok.  I will say it's better than 99% of her other music.
Boring yuck I hope they don't play this on country music stations.
The song is sorry. But she is still fine as wine. Solid
Absolutely Amazing 👏   God damn, this hits.
She should’ve been done this lawd 🎉 Great music this will get that award Tina turner said go European if you want to be huge and supported glad she stop listening to that hater husband lol Kelly wants
I think she will never stop until she wins grammy for the record of the year That award supposed to be hers for instead of others❤
Jayz so jealous of her he gone say “ she got more then everybody” (him too lol ) but she never won album of the year the shade then when they exit nobody said bye to him just her lol she the bigger artist he meant to embarrass her cmon now but she crossed over and I’m sure she always wanted to but cared to much bout his opinion but now she taking off now 🎉🎉🎉
Now she gone win Album of the Year  Jayz so jealous of her he knew if she stayed making that r en b stuff he try and write her she wasn’t gone win she now branches off and switch writers like Dionne Warwick did well done 🎉 I think she wanted to do this every since Irreplaceable Neyo wrote that for her and said it was a country song Jayz prolly kept saying no u can’t tell he a narcissist
I literally said over the weekend more black people need to embrace country music, & here comes the Queen putting out a country album… I’m on ya frequency Bey 🐝 💜💜 I love this. So wholesome 🥳🥳🥰🥰
Beyoncé is so Talented!
Black people created the banjo. So glad she did this!!! Let’s take back what they stole
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not for everyone..
Here before 5,000,000
Queen Did it again on them. ❤❤❤
Strip club look😮 nothing about the look says country and western😅
this shit sucks no wonder she had to be almost naked, it is everything but country music
Obrigado por existir❤
Oh paaaaleeeezz!🙄
I love this song so much I could cry so proud of her.
Poor USHER she had to do it the same nite. Ehhhhhh not my cup of tea. Maybe it will get on me . Probably not
I honestly cannot stand Beyonce and her husband and I don’t need anymore of sneak peaks of her vagina. Ppl act like her going to country is so revolutionary. All she is doing is switching genres for her masters to help them objectify, exploit, and hyper sexualize black women in country music. There is nothing revolutionary about this. Someone like Whitney, or Adele, Aretha, or Taylor for example  are more talented than Beyonce. Women using sex appeal in performances doesn't come from society only excepting women as sex objects, in comes from women lacking the talent to get popularity without sex appeal.   The difference between Taylor and Beyonce is Taylor doesn’t have to hyper sexualize herself people still would buy her music anyway because she’s that talented. That’s why Beyonce doesn’t deserve album of the year. I believe musical talent should be the primary factor in determining the worthiness of an artist for awards.  In my personal perspective, I believe that Beyonce's popularity is largely influenced by her use of hypersexualization in her performances. I feel that without this aspect, she may not have achieved the same level of success. On the other hand, Taylor Swift's success seems to be primarily driven by her musical talent and the quality of her songs. It appears that she doesn't rely heavily on hypersexualization to maintain her popularity. This is why I personally feel that Beyonce may not deserve certain accolades, such as Album of the Year.
Country music station listeners are missing out 🤷‍♀️
Beyoncé I see you. 😜
🤠👢🐎
Bey continues to demonstrate why she is a living legend!
Well she from Texas
She showing Taylor she could do it to
I’m glad you make country music because most America is country
I don't care what race she is, I like music no matter who creates it. But sorry, this song sucks.
MOTHER IS HOT
Beyonce is a very hard working sis wow  she doesn't stop keep making that money sis proud of you
This is Texas and so is she! ❤
Yoncè … what is this 🤨. I love you but this ain’t it for me .
Honestly I'm not a fan...She should've left out her cuss words...Banjo and back up singers fantastic...
Please leave a like or a comment if you believe this song is a masterpiece.
wtf is this?  you can tell she is desperate so trying something different but no
I love Beyoncé she’s such a damn boss
Huh?
What is she advertising  porn and human trafficking?
love it
Love it
YES
Love it Bey❤
THERE'S A TORNADO IN MY CITY
Vem para o Brasil ❤️
I like this song...I can see a good line dance
wow, this is so bad and i love country, my question is why?
BANGER I CRIED
wtf lol 😂 y’all this ain’t country music this is just Beyoncé doing shit… this isn’t country at all
I love it❤❤❤
Hoedown❤❤❤❤
Love this so much. Go Bey
Yessssss ma'am!!!!! Need to get me some boots and my hat!!!!
I’m here supporting you Bey🤘🏽
Love this ❤
beyonce is such a creative artist! nobody can top that
Needs to stay away from country music she's ruining it  😑
this is something else ! Damn! a masterpiece! Queen B did it again
She sounds a little like Dolly. I love it!
Ahora hace música para viejos😢
Rock n roll Bee
I miss the days when we got singles and there were remix versions of the song, featuring other artists. I'd love a Dolly a Beyonce song! That would be iconic! Don't get me wrong this is awesome and it's great as it is but 5 year old me and 15 year old me wonders what that would sound like
Lmao why am I finna be blasting this in my car
Vem feat com a Ana Castela 🤠
Super clever with all her experience over the years to just have the same 17 second clip on repeat. She'll get video of the year for sureeee
Fucking garbage. Stick to shit music to warp the minds of your youth
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
She looks great, sounds great, & conquering  a new genre.  I'd  say its a yes.
I love it.
HO DOWN GET DOWN HO! Bars. Lol listening for first time in my livestream
A mamãe acertou muito nessa..❤
this is stupid and ridiculous , go back to your own music cause this ain't country, this ain't going anywhere,
Cool!
SEMPRE ENTREGANDO TUDO😍😍🤣
Whirlpool Oz
radio #beyhive assemble
Beyonce bey somehow knowing what we need when we need it. Period.
i’m sooooo ready
This sounds desperate asf!!!
UGHHH!!!!!....Do not like this country crap. Bey stay away, you are better than this!
This is a different Beyonce 🤔
ohhh I love this beyonce era
This Song is nice’ Sounds 🎤 really good❗️
"You are Beyonce."  "Thank you"
Awesome Song! White people are going to be line dancing like an MF to this song somewhere in a saw dust hall and bars around America. Beyonce is a true Texan.
Awful. No country artist would come out dressed like that.
I found my feet tapping. I’m an Oklahoma native 😂😂
Because her genre is failing 😂
Ooh can’t nobody walk like Queen B you are creative and diverse for this one😂👑
she's so talented... wow.  this is catchy
Absolutely fabulous, you go girl?  👏👏👏👏😊🌹
She kept her lane while simultaneously being the epitome of a renaissance woman. Virgo sh** 😌✌🏾
Omg I love country music💯
I like THIS one.
I see your little baphomet hand gesture there
This is a better country song than anything Jason Aldean or these other MAGA country artists could even think of doing.   Taking country back to Black. Slay queen, slay. ❤❤
Beyonce is not the first. Only because it's her that "blacks are taking back country "😑. It never left us blacks. There's no money for us in that genre. So what do we do? We write the songs for those who can push the music💯. Chaka Khan has a way better country song on her album Chaka Khan called Best in the West❤
I’m not a huge fan of Beyoncé but she have me with this
🚮
I thought country music was more white people music
THAT'S SOME MIGHTY FINE PICKIN' N SINGIN' 🤠
Ok now
Not gonna win album of the year
This is horrible. Yikes.
Bey, You did that!
I love the song but hate the video. They don't dress this way in country music. She's not doing hip hop she's in the country genre she needs to cover up and don't show your boobs.
This is not country
The song's okay, the video is annoying.
Lawd… B burning down the barn. YeeHaw!😂😂😂😂
Beyonce is a queen of versatility! She always surprises us with her amazing talent ,and creativity. She never repeat herself or gets stuck in a rut. Shes explores different genres styles, and moods with her music ,and performances. She is a true artist, and an inspiration to us all!
Real music is back ❤
The reason ya' all are relating to this and it sounds so good is because it's not country!! This is slang/twang pop! Please do not confuse the two.
LoVe ❤️
Put some clothes on I know your mom raised you better than that .
Cool
Need to get Post Malone on the remix
Nice.. watch Taylor swift drop debut next than see who is the country queen.. lol
This isn’t country…
Country music origins are from folk music, which comes from Europe. We gotta stop trying to claim everything….
More 🗑️ she should just retire
Music genres created by blacks, know that we are music and music is us. Music: Hip Hop, Rock and Roll, Jazz, Raggae, R&B, Konpa, Blues, Soca, Folk, Soul, Country, Rasin, Military, Rap, Negro Spirituals, Classicals, Mizik Lakou, Salsa was created from Afro-beats + other beats.  We are limitless!!! BLACK THE CREATOR  COUNTRY MUSIC WAS CREATED BY Jimmie Rodgers, GOD'S PEOPLE LEAD GOD LEADS
Her voice can literally do any genre of music!
Definitely do not like
Country isn’t my thing but I 100,000% support Beyoncé stepping into this genre and I’ll listen to every song she puts out just to show support
She seems too laid back in her vocal expression. Too mellow. This should have a an all out hoedown feel. Listen to some Shania Twain.
Suddenly I like country 😅😅😅
This is giving major summer vibes. I cant wait to pop this on car rides through the forest and mountains
Iconic honestly
If she was smart she would have a country artist featured otherwise it’s just a country r&b hybrid song
Absolutely luv B🥳👌💖
So far from country music it’s not even funny…
Evolving Beyoncé is giving star 🤩🤩🤩
Man, here we go again. Taking it to a whole another level!! Bee always giving us that work.
Beyoncé is so talented, gifted Blessed and Highly Favored❤❤❤
It doesn’t sound bad but this is pop, not country.
Not country at all.
queen bee 👑🐝 🔥❤
I can just tell that this song gon be blasting out them speakers at the Rodeo
❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
She put lyrics in here, paying homage to multiple styles and genres then brought them all home together with the "I'll be d*mned if I can't slow dance with you".  🐝
Waiting on the line dance
Love everything except the over skin chest! Why do they want her to sell sex, she doesn’t need to
I dont like it.... but go head on
YEEEEEHAWWWWWW!!!! YASSSSSS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Giant CGI Fake tits... How empowering! Such a role model for young women!
Not good terrible
WHY
Wth is this
❤❤🌹😍🤠🤠
😂😂😂
Finally 🩷🩷🩷
Te amo♥
Kanye West has always had a point
🔥👑
I see a line dance coming! 🤩💃🤠
I'm 🤯🤯 but now I need the whole choreography of this one 😍🤠🤠🤠
Kylie do it better and years before
Keep streaming
Wow what a song. Bravo 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
A billionair has no insight on being country
my girl will always be remarkable....you heard
À chier
Bey is a skinny white girl with new breast now but i like hold em
This isn’t country IMO you can’t just add a twang, n say “ho down” and call it country …  Try harder 🙄
I'm sure Alan Jackson is turning in his grave
Even the music sounds Country, her vocals sound very soulful and doesn't quite fit the instruments. Also don't dress slutty futuristic. They like more use your imagination looks.
So this is why the skin lightening pics were circulating.
Uh, yeah...
This is beautifully.  Her voice is  audible.  We hearing her vocals i love it.
Ok I’m liking it.
For the record, country music isn't black or white, its just American. But yall gotta chill on claiming to have created every modern genre of music lol its just delusional. No hate, just get real.
This ain’t that abnormal for her. She’s literally a Texan 😅
This ain’t that abnormal for her. She’s literally a Texan 😅
I really love this sooo goood
A lot of haters in the comments.  I wonder if they realize their view counts as a stream which = money for Beyonce. Even in hate they are making it a hit song.  LOL
I need Carrie Underwood or Dolly Parton on this remix.
This is super good! This will be the Beyoncé forever classic and the album that win the Grammy wow! Love Beyonce
This makes me proud to be a Texan although I'm not a Texan and from Hawai'i. 💀
This is as bad as all other country music
my dance teacher played this lol
Like!!! I like some country as well.time for us tap into that multi billion dollar industry 😊
Put some damn clothes on what the hell
I absolutely hate this. I can’t even listen to the whole song. It’s terrible. 😭
Awful gross and trashy
She’s so unpredictable and I love it 🥰
She so blessed my body look like shit after kids.😩
🙏🏿
Hermoso todo BeyQueen 👑
Bateu o carro Beyonce? E esses airbags ai
i love country music and i like this one alot
Maravilhosa de todo jeito!
Act II gonna be so good
She needs to do a country collab with Posty
She’s a mother. Maybe she should dress like one
what the is this garbage! This ain't country and our culture isn't your costume! This is culture appropriation.
Beyonce, please do a gospel album!!!!!
❤❤❤ beyonce rainha
I’m a country fanatic, oldie and new music buttttt thisss im impressed x100 never expected at all
Fail
Nah…i don’t like it.
❤❤❤❤❤
This is americana, not country.
Oh gosh! Had the nerve to think I wouldn’t like her country work lol 😂
Only Bey can have a repetitive looped image as a video and it be 🔥🔥🔥!!!
Good Beyoncé Beyoncé Texas Hold Em Official Visualizer Happy Birthday 2024
Ok so what’s with this video ? It’s kinda blah .
youuuuuu, touuuuu, wouuuu wouhhhhh....that's the only parts blud could sing
❤❤❤❤❤❤!
Shred me alive i am just a token white beyonce observer but this song has lumineer vibes and i wish she came as heavy as she did with daddy lessons. If i dont feel the desire to slap my knee and blow on a jug and bake a peach pie its not hitting the country marks for me 🫠
Maybe she’ll bring attention to the other black woman of country music: chapel heart, Mickey Guyton, and few others that don’t get mentioned.
❤it ❤️
We’re about to get the CUNTRYIEST LINE DANCE EVER ! 🔫
one of those releases for looking back from the future to remember how impactful this art was 🎉
Put some clothes on!  Have some self respect!  Is showing up in video basically topless some how cool!  Nope, not at all. Using your body to sell your music is nauseating!  What kind of influence are you on kids these days?  This is disgusting and very disappointing!
I like this song... ✅👍
❤❤❤🤠
Yes to the song No to the video
I didn’t really care for the last album she dropped but I like this 😂😂
Beyoncé wants to be Taylor swift so bad 😩🤣💯
This ain't country should be the name of the song because It's NOT!!
HOT GARBAGE
Love this vibe 🙃🖤
Why does she have her jugs out?
Oooweeeee. My heart needed this. ❤
This is real country music.  I need Beyoncé fans to find a place and sit. Country music is my fav genre of music, it has been for over 10+ years now, however; saying B is the queen of Country is just ridiculous. That’s even more disrespectful to all the hard working black country female artists that has been in the game longer and has actual real country songs. Wearing cowboy hat and boots and titling ur song “Red Dipsy Cup” doesn’t make u a country artist. The 🐝s doing way too much
This is a surprise but a nice one. I mean, I like the way her voice fixs perfect in this song. It brings a good vibe❤
Not country lol
It's cool
If this is country the Willy is the king of pop lol
maybe she forgot what she was doing, these are twerking clothes :D :D I am usually a fan, but she is getting more and more trashy.
Everybody hypnotized by this clone smh... All I can say is clone Tyrone 😢
It’s a good song , but didn’t give me the goosebumps from that country feeling could be better
So we going to make a line dance for this song
Whooo is she aiming them shots at Nicki!
She need more twang
The queen is here🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝 🤠 Texas take this cowboy shit very serious!! I’m here from Chicago 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Toda countryzinha
Very beautiful and sexy woman ❤️
this is such a random release as far as i'm aware and i am thoroughly shook. didn't really listen to her last album much cause it was so popular but this right here is very reminiscent of the previous eras in which i felt spiritually led. such a nice vibe and i love it more than i thought i would ahhhh praise to beyonce and her team xoxo
Outstanding
I’m completely blown away!! I can NOT get enough !! Beyoncé is a drug and I am a junkie!!!
This shits hot garbage
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OWN EM BEY
7/10🎉
nicely crafted ..... impressive
love you bey
Toda arte dessa mulher  Possui uma sensibilidade consensual incrível ❤
Can’t wait for the line dance! 🤘🏾🤠🇨🇱

Love the music but why the nakedness? #Distraction.
As someone who listens to actual country music...this is not country. Beyonce sounds the same in every song. Just because it has tambourines in the background doesn't make it country...aye yi yi.
Love it
Song kinda sucks.
Shit is wack.
Not her usual genre, but i like it.
I like it!!💜👍🏾✌🏾
This is the closest we get to the visuals 😂
I love this song lol. 🔥
Please go and judge my recent upload in the comment section🫠
That Shit Ain’t Country…😂
Bringing nasty to county music one song at a time. Why she gotta come straight out with her boobs hanging out smh
What’s on her eye ?
A Lexus?  It would be a truck. She's not country and never will be. Can't stand her music and her whiny husband.
First Beyoncé song on a playlist of mine... ever ...
All marketing.
WtF! I fucking love this- I’m so in love with the beautiful Beyoncé!
It was Ours first!! 💪🏿🤠
The phuck kind of video is this.
I can’t wait for the music video. It’s gonna be MADNESS as always ❤️👑🐝
She so bad
The Queen ❤
Piosenka mi się podoba, lecz teledysk zupełnie nie pasuje. Za muzykę ❤
I love Country music.  My favorite Spotify playlist is country frequency which only features Black country music artists... so with confidence and dissapointment, I say this is terrible. I'm fan of Bey but this ain't it.  I'm sorry.
The song starts at 3:18. I could hear the rest on repeat forever.
Meh
I love you so much 💓❤😘❤😘❤
This what I mean when I say I like country music lol 💕
Pretty sure this video is AI
I can’t wait to see the entire video!
This is ironically the most unseasoned “country” song ive heard in a min. Aside from something like Florida Georgia Line. Its not bad it just doesnt have any soul. Props for expanding her horizons though.
She is from Houston, Texas so this is a natural progression for her! I hope she comes to the Houston Livestock & Rodeo again! I would love for her to sing at the Grand Ole Opry!!
let’s all pray and hope she Will finally a grammy for best album next year! RENAISSENCE ❤️❤️ the best thrillogy.
Bravo🎉
Obsessed with this! One of the greatest entertainers we have ever been blessed with. She can do it all! 🐝 👑
I wonder if the CMAs are they going to treat her like lil Nas X
Black Americans the worlds biggest culture vultures. They swear every culture music and dance came from them 😂😂😂
Black Americans are becoming the worlds biggest cultural vultures.. they swear every culture and music derived from them 😂😂😂 when u create nothing else I guess u have to do stuff like that
Wait til the line dance comes out. . Wahoo!
Omg we all gonna be at the concert doing the line dance
I’m sorry this doesn’t sound like country to be only the best does
If old Town road is country, then this is country
Remember when country fans  were angry when she sang with the chicks cause se not country. Wel she country now
I loved that she held this era for her matured voice🫠
Song and visuals are so on point!! Like if you’re here before 100 million
A whole Genre takeover 🎉🎉🎉
Who thought we all might line dance after a nice twerk on Beyoncés music 😂🤣
Y'all got to be kidding me this is absolutely awful and y'all know it
If she is trying to be a country music she should not have shown a top like that.  That is just uncalled for.
I'VE BEEN A COUNTRY  FAN SINCE LORETTA LYNN DAYS I LOVE THIS SONG BEYONCE HAS BOUGHT TO COUNTRY NEVER REALLY LISTEN TO HER MUSIC BEFORE NOW SHE DID IT WILL BE DANCING TO THIS COUNTRY SONG 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Good song.  Excellent pair.

Oh wow I thought it would be more explicitly pop/crossover. This is just Beyoncé singing a country song. I really like it!
Dear god.. thank you
Reclaiming time. Ya'll ready❤
Does anyone know why some country music stations are rejecting this song? It  sounds more country than some country songs released in recent times.
😭😭😭 i mean, is this the same woman who just finished an amazing renaissance tour / movie ?   AT WHAT TIME THIS WOMAN WROTE/RECORDED THIS?  Anyways, thank you for this master piece, my driving time will be just perfect now 😊😁🙃😌 im already addicted to this album and im proud of it 😅
So she’s Adele now?
holy Beyoncé I had never heard country music before her , I discovered it and that's good🎉🎉
Be great without the cuss words
Why does she have to be so naked??? She can sing, dance, writes etc. She has no need to
Déception 👎🏼
A inconfundível voz poderosa de Beyoncé 👏👏👏👏
❤❤ queen

Ain't no way yall going nutz over this bullsh*+
Lol
Tá muito bom ❤
I LOVE CUNTRY MUSIC NOW 😍
I have never listened to her music, but this is pretty good. Sounds more country than many modern country artists.
I missed you welcome back ❤
only good thing about this was her showing her boobs lol song is garbage
🖤🔥👑🖤🔥
I‘m sorry but this is bullshit. Just because you put a Banjo in a Song dosen‘t mean it‘s Country. Were is the Message Beyonce? Are your bored and do you think Country is that easy that it only deserves 2 riffs??? Buuuuuhhhhh! 👎 hate it
This sounds country, but 16 carriages does not.  I love bey, I love country!!!!
she said i am gonna get that album of the year grammy
John 3:16
Reminds me of "Something in the water" by Book Fraser
This song. This attitude?!  Could heal America. Think about it.
I'm here because of Rhiannon Giddens 🪕
i dont like country music that much and actually never listened. But this one is different. Beyonce made me like country now hahha. Also her other song 16 Carriages..........what a beautiful song of hers
i am a cowgirl now
I LOVE Daddy lessons so much I’ve been waiting for more!

QUEEN👏🏻BEY👏🏻
A TRUE ALCHEMIST! ❤️🐝
No gonna lie only time I would here country music is if I am a karaoke party but I have listened to this a few times now and loving it❤
This is so refreshing! Black woman taking country back ‼️
flop ❤
A dope writers credit or feature on this project would be K.Michelle. she has wanted to do country for a while but labels wouldn't back it. if you push aside her "antics" over the years she is extremely talented especially in country music.
Beyoncé is invited to participate in Country music. That is it and this is all. Sorry is this not worthy of nothing but entertainment temporarily. Hell I'm still waiting on a ACTUALLY R&B ALBUM, nothing global, nothing extra, nothing overdone for production & dancing, just a simple classic "Regular" love song vibe & chill R&B album.
Yeah, Rhiannon Giddens!!
This song makes me wanna doe see doe, a dance!!!
They're going to have a field day with this video.
SOS
I love that she's going to present the real Texas attitude to the world. feels like home
She is a very talented & very pretty woman. I always liked her, but the “illumi” stuff is very unattractive. I often wonder how they use their billions to help others. 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️Idk. I feel like she is stuck forever with him no matter what, like it or not. Idk. All just opinions here.
🔥🔥🔥
Queen did that 😍🔥 the songs reminds Me of Adele
Dear lord this is awful 😖 just like the rest of her music 😂
let’s be real in a couple months absolutely nobody will wake up and say oh i wanna listen to this song.
So inspired by this woman she has no barriers I can’t wait for the album ❤
I love black people .. I wish I was blacker✍️
Is this why she looks so white
Country music is the music of black folks. We sang country music in the South.
❤❤❤
Taylor keeps winning so she had join the same genre lmaooo
I'm here for this!
😂
You go girl!!! 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 Texas Hold’em 🔥🔥🔥
Hot 🔥 Dam !!!
Never getting act 1 visuals
Rhiannon Giddens on banjo and viola!! 😍😍
TS started her career out with country music all she is showing that she’s trying to keep up with her don’t get it twisted I like B but after the Grammy Awards it looks like she’s just trying to keep up with her even tho the music was already in the making she just released it at a bad time it may be good great awesome music it’s just bad timing TS will win again and I’m no fan of her and yes she is our hometown girl but I still don’t care for her
Sounds like early 2000s Keisha bullshit
For some reason I want Cracker Barrel
❤
Beyoncé please collaborate with Gaga 😩❤️
Sounds good Bey
Will not compete on the country and western scene.  Should have hired real country and western musicians and writers.  Copied the title from another song.  Get out before you're put to shame.  What radio station would play this loop.  Same loop over and over.  Rap with a bango.
Please you didn’t see to many or hardly any black western actors she’s just trying to keep up with TS
The song is ok. The visual for a country song no ma'am.
They got play it on country channel for it to accepted. 🤠
I love the way she walks 😍❤️❤️‍🔥🔥
I think she got this.
Nice bobies
Irra.. mamãe fala eu obedece ♥
This is crap
Beyoncé navega por vários estilos e sempre saí com maestria! Impressionante, não sou fã de country e não acompanho nada sobre mas o fato é que ela sabe ser artista.
BThis is Rhiannon Giddens (founder of Carolina Chocolate Drops) playing and singing with Beyonce.
Já pode ir pesquisa passagem pra vim pro Brasil meu anjo, desse act não passa
❤❤❤❤❤
Not country
ADDICTING❤
She can't be serious 🫣. This is horrible 😬 🤦‍♀️. Poor thing she should have thought a little harder about this! No, no, this is not it!!
1M views would be just me listening to this masterpiece on repeat ❤ Y’all entering the country era 🐴
She's a goddess of music 🔥
so fun
Oh give me a freaking break. Stay in your lane Beyonce.
"I said I want something big - BEYONCE!!!!! 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
She can sing anything plus she has previously embraced her southern roots in various songs.
Shes gonna win country album of the year and album of the year at grammys with this album... Im not even subcribed to her but this was on my feed and i love it... i love country music
Absolutely righteous.
Yassss..we need to be in ALL music genres.  Like everybody over here
I love it Superstar😘😘🥰🥰💃💃💃💃💃
Come thru with the country album! Overdue in my opinion.  Love the song daddy lessons.  Country music has many facets just like other genres of music.
This might be it, this might be the song that gets me started on a beyonce discography journey!
Not a fan of the imagery, real country music is wholesome, this is not.
Like the song not the video.
this is so refreshing  ❤❤❤❤
Awful....and definitely not a country song
When you can't beat Taylor, so you start singing country whack whack
Ok Bey Giselle!!!’
My first country concert coming up B?
Nice Satan snake over the left eye. Always gotta flash your Illuminati alligance huh?
Her vocals shine more on this type of music
Amazing song
Lovely song. Rhiannon Giddens on the banjo was great. If you like this you will like her too. Check her out. Black banjo players rock!
Beyoncé going country was not on my 2024 bingo card, damn she's going to eat this genre up.
Phuck no
❤
I love country music so I really hoped this would be the day I found a Beyonce song that I could jam to.. 😩 womp womp.
Eu amei!!! Maravilhosa ❤❤
❤
Thanks to Bey now I'm a country music fan 😭❤️
Sounds better than 99.9% of whatever Nashville is pushing out. I'd listen to this any day.
I LOVE IT 🥰❤❤❤
I like the soul in this song.

BEYONCE PARTON
Oh Mama! Yeeeessss!!🙌🏾🥰💐
i just dont get it 14 febuary
mmm.  idk.   beats country / lyrics comes off some what country / sounds like the same ole Beyonce to me, she need to put more  TWAIN in her voice !!. almost feel like she's doing it, just to do it. cuz she can. on some takeover shit. not from the heart.  K. Michelle from the heart! Beyonce gonna knock it out the park cus of who she is. but sounds the same to me
I´m a country music fan. But I was so pissed what they did to The Chicks and Beyoncé on CMAs... I´m not a huge B fan (I´m a huge The Chicks fan) but I love this. She sounds more country than most country artists now. I believe core country music fans will be furious and I´m here for it! You go girl!
Amazingly done Bey
Howdyyy beyhive 🤠
Wow you better work. I like this
then shoes are design
Joyous genius.
wow.  thisi is great.  wow.  i clicked on this video very very skeptical.  wow.
LOVE her voice... LOVE the song... the two combined is simply awesome! But... and yes, I'm sorry but there is a 'but'... she might consider changing her attire for C&W. While it's perfect for her previous genre of music I just don't think it quite fits country.
Beyoncé is the goat!!! Don’t argue with me argue with yo’ mama…… ❤❤
Queen Bey is such a workaholic, She doesn't know what pause is. I like it.
Say it with me now…  Medi…  …ocre.
Terrible
Love it🎉🎶🎵👑 she bad❤❤
😐
Nipple-less Beyonce is weird
Queen Bey 😮🥰 Gurl what I'm at work😱💦
Big fans beyonce destiny's child
BEYONCE GIVE IT UP ... SOMETHING UNATTRACTIVE WITH SOMEONE YOUR AGE STILL GOING AT IT AUNTIE !!!
I think I like country music now 🤔
Beyonce you look different what new  hair
I thought it was a music video, it’s just the same 5 second clip repeating on a loop ? Song is cute, but I don’t really like country
Boring video.
We need rock too! Don't hurt yourself vibes
This is amazing
verizon down yet?
Repetitive just like Break My Soul, why it didn’t go anywhere. Just trying to feed off her name and put out average music. If this was a new singer songwriter this would go nowhere.
Put your tits away , geez girl your a legend ..😮
Even they can’t not give her Album of the Year she still the Queen just supper talented ❤❤
It's not something that will be on my play list but she gets points for making that song & style work for her. #2024cmawinner 👸🏿🐝
shes def had a boob job
All country music artists who dropped albums this year are about to come up short on awards
I'm just and tapping my feet and reaching for my tambourine #Beyonce👸🏾💪🏾❤️💐💐🌺🌺🌺
This is so good <3
Really think you find your new genre.  This song is really amazing
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
She coming country music world ❤❤❤
Super super chilled
artists who take risk by trying other music styles 🔥🔥🔥
Im going to leave a comment here so in the future i can always look back to tjis masterpiece here
grandma needs to put on some clothes. hasn't been attractive in two decades.
Beyonce has an amazing voice and is incredibly talented, but a country singer, she is not.
im the 9,999 comment ( thank you universe ) love this BEY !!!!
O Brasil te ama Queen B
Not. Listening. To. That. Again. 😩😖
Such a fun song. Go country bey ❤
Lord have mercy, what did my ears just hear? I think it's Beyonce crossing over to country. Please don't. Country music does not need Jay-Z putting his 2 cents worth into Country Music/No Shoes Nation. Stay in your lane!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Queen B♍️💜❤️♍️👑👑! I'm a Black Queen from NASHVILLE TN!! PLENTY OF COUNTRY and YOU STEPPED WITH THIS ONE! BANGING THIS ONE 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This song is trash & I don't care what the hive has to say about it.  Just cause it's Beyonce, doesn't mean it's good.
she went from ballroom to country. im sat
Promo SM ❤
Country music ok... Why not? But wtf is this message the video saying other then she's gone ratchet!
Terrible song honestly next ,bye
I love you Beyoncé ❤️🇧🇷
mother
If you like that Banjo its from Rhiannon Giddens..check her out :)!  This is a cool song... glad to see this direction :)

Put some clothes on.
Fantástiq
The Queen is on a mission to connect the nation and assist in fostering world peace through music. This is more than just an experiment with genre, it is a movement to help free the minds of the burdened.
This is AWESOME!! Yesss Beyoncé
A PISTOLEIRA
BEYONCÉÉÉÉ
Beyonce is whoever she think she is📌📌📌
This ain’t for me ♥️ I tried to listen 👂🏽 but it wasn’t it for me. But I wish her success with Act 2
Oh my Bey
Bellissima Beyoncé e bellissima canzone
😅😅😅 yall are brainwashed 😅😅😅
Rhiannon Giddens on banjo!
Renaissance is one of the best albums ever made. I’m so excited for act II.
Worst country song ever ...
😅😂😂😂😂
ITS A TORNADO ALRITE...JAY Z WHY U LET HER DO THAT?  WIPE HER RIGHT OFF THE BILL BOARD.  YONCE GO SIT DWN & ENJOY LIFE!!
É a maior mesmo!!!! Só ela para me fazer country girl 🤎
Wtf did i just watch
Diva!!!!👢👢🤠
❤❤❤❤❤
go check out Albo D'nero. he got fire music!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Das video war in der Produktion  preiswert oder. Warum muss sie dazu noch nackt sein , sie hat styl und kann genauso gut im hosenanzug Auftreten.
She’s absolutely slaying any genre 🤌🏽
🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
This is not country music.
Photogenic... Shoot ❤❤
Sounds like folk pop from 2010s. Cool frailing banjo intro!
This is that song
💯👏🕺💃👯👯‍♂👯‍♀
🐝 👑 🐎 👒
I pray there's no backlash like they did to her when she performed at the CMA's in 2016, while performing with the Dixie Chicks. I never understood why our Race get so much backlash when we want to try different things. When we accept all cultures to do rap, r&b, blues and we never complain. But our artist get so much bs about wanting to try other genres, especially a genre our race created.
❤❤❤
I did not expect country music beat from Beyoncé ever! This is now different!?
Wear a holster and call it country. lol
Seeing all of this positivity is heart warming.
She lookin' so white girl anymore.
🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
Yessss, Beyoncé! I love it! 🐝🐝🐝
Texas hold em? Hold her jugs?
Beyoncé coming for that album of the year ! oh y’all like country music ? OKAY WATCH THIS
jaaaaa 💃🎶🎤
Elizabeth Lowell Boland should be ashamed of herself for writing this for Beyonce. How about we don't enable the Carter's to try monopolize the music industry just because they're mad that Taylor won AOTY. I'll never understand the hype surrounding Beyonce---so for people to act like she can just genre-hop effortlessly and it'll be welcomed is just pure insanity. They knew Taylor was going to win so they had this ready. IF the song is charting, its because she obviously has a large fan-base who would listen to her chew food and say its a hit--- NOT because country fans are listening to it
That banjo!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I honestly don’t care for it, I think she is an icon!! But this just doesn’t have it for me personally
I will play this while driving to "The Breakfast Club" to get me some Chicken & Waffles and Sweet Tea........  H-people know what I am talking about.
As a Houstonian, this song really is Houston vibes. Beyonce + Country...
Bro these songs are eating I like the era of beyonce we are in
Act II wont have a world tour like the renai... she'll have a residency show in the Sphere for this album instead. 🥰
If B don't win a CMA for this one, sh*t is rigged. 🔥🎧
🔥🔥🔥
She is duplicating what Monica is doing. Can Beyonce be Orginal for once in her Life.
Ooh🤭
❤️😍
I'm not a fan of Beyoncé and country music, but this is a very cool country song! I'm buying a cowgirl hat n boots today.👢🤠
This isn't country music, but it's still better than about 90% of what passes for country music nowadays.
So Beyonce is a half-naked hot version of Kano from Mortal Kombat.
I love cuntry music.
What genre can Bey NOT sang? ...not 'Nan.... she's MULTI-TALENTED at MULTI-TASKING 💛
Not me tapping my foot the entire time on my way home.. on the gas 😭😂
Yes baby! Get back to your Houston roots! Yee-haw! 🤠
❣️  This is  fire
Usa 🇺🇲🤟
Alright… take it to the Flo now!!
Lay yours cards down, down, down, down... 🐎
Gospel next!???????? ❤❤❤❤ this gal can do anything!!!!!
🤠👠
I’m feeling this song
jajajajajajajajaja como vieron que en México están triunfando los corridos, USA viene a copiar jajajaja pero el único que hacía Country era Post Malone y para acabarla LV sacó su ropa estilo country, cuando en México ya estaba de moda todo el 2022 y 2023.
Loving COUNTRY MUSIC😊
Whoo Hoo Hoo
I feel a dance routine coming🎉
Hahahh ….

The first Beyoncé song I like after „halo“
This is not country
TAKE THAT TAYLOR  ALL HAIL THE QUEEN 😭😭🎊🎊🎊🥰🥰✊🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is offensive to country music this is terrible
90% of people here came for TITS. Its funny how the media, entertainment and the powerful get peoples attention so easily with this stuff. This is why eveything nowadays specifically popular music like pop, rap and hiphop is overlly sexualized. Can you blame the powerful? Sex sells.
This song has been on repeat, I love feel good music, no matter the genre 💃💃💃💃
I never in a million years ever thought I would be bobbin' my head, tapping my feet, and moving my hips to country music. Beyonce has introduced me to something extra special. I'm digging this.
It’s ok 🎉 why now when the barbs are about to go on tour! So ironic.. they have too much money , she can give way to other artists now.
Thank you Beyonce coz now i like country music
lol putting some country music buzz words in a pop song and calling it country doesn’t make it country.
I love this song.
❤❤❤
meh
The air of desperation to remain relevant is strong 🙄 "I can't beat everyone for a Grammy, so let's see if I can go to "country" music and take all the awards".
Beyonce with the wonderful Rhiannon Giddens plucking the banjo and singing along. What a way to start a gloomy, rainy Tuesday morning!!
Yaaaaaaas ❤
What a lot of you are not understanding is that Beyoncé is from Houston. She grew up on country. She is country. She was a fan of Selena Quintanilla, which is Mexican country music. She wants a change and there’s nothing wrong with that. Will country music except her with open arms maybe but it doesn’t mean she’s changed anything she’s just another artist trying to cross over.❤
Brazil here!! Postando aqui, uma maneira de a cada brasileiro que curtir ou comentar... o youtube vai avisar! E eu vou voltar aqui pra ouvir tudo de novo!! HAHAHA [here, a way for every brazilian or not who likes or comments... YouTube will let me know! so...I'll back here and hear it all over again!! HAHAHA]
I love it!
Love iittt, Big fan of B from the beginning  but act 1 not a fan... Now im backkkkk. She already did a country music in lemonade so su haters . Kisses from France ❤
That's that other money
Ok Bey I llike this!!!!
This is down right disrespectful to our Lord and Savior yall better look closely that’s not a gun sign she’s throwing up that’s the baphomet sign! They showing who there are they don’t care anymore. This world is coming to an end! Jesus is returning soon with a sword in his mouth! I will never support this evil and demonic soul ever! Please if you stand for God stay away from Beyoncé!
Never listened to Beyonce before. I mostly listen to folk and blues. Gave this a try because she brought in the best banjo player on the planet for this song. Hope this gives Rhiannon Giddens and her work more exposure. Gidden's work in bringing the history of banjo to fans has been wonderful also!
Yikes. Thankful I dislike country. They can keep her!
I be damn if I can not  dance with you ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BPOC 🤝COUNTRY MUSIC.
Queeen MF’N Bey😍
I love this❤
Yesssss. Love it :)
Ray Charles is smiling down at this 1!
Bee Hive>swifties!
Taylor Swift ft Beyoncé on TS Debut TV would ATE 😫🤠
QUEEEEEEENNN
YES
Aight B i love it
Oh. They're going to make a country line dance to this song.
QUEEEENN
Sounds like an r & b singer trying to sound country. Country music is more than some words, a twang and a banjo.
Johnny Cash likes it
Wow. Lemme find out Bey might need to make a country album..🤠😎
Pif Paf!  I hit the button like before even started playing
Yeee mfn hawww !
Does beyonce listen to corridos
Brazil?🇧🇷
i though beyonce was dark skinned looks  lot lighter here
Never been one for Beyonce but there are some songs I like by her but this song totally rocks.
Ok Ce` ... 💥💥💥
Beyoncé got my ass square dancing
Adoro ❤
yesss !! love this!!
❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let see how many country music fans Beyonce can create out of R&B in 2024
❤❤❤ ok now where's the line dance 😊😊😊 waiting and ready to take it to the floor 😂
A maior artista do mundo
Yeeehawww 😂
mama slayonce
Honestly this song is bullshid, but y'all won't say it because it's y'all idol. I said what I meant.
Peace. I'm positive the visuals will be "GIVING".
Wack, ask a country music fan if they like this. Easy $ for mediocre sound. Garbage...
This is pop not country… this is trash
Society is FANNED the F Out...
This with a remix from Joanne would be so lit.     Gaga’s albums always predict the future of music
I’m so disappointed. It’s boring, too long and repetitive. What’s with the gun fingers shooting at nothing ? The sexualization doesn’t fit   The whole video is ridiculous. What’s her point here. I really like Beyonce. She’s multi talented beautiful and mostly original. I think she’s missed the mark here. I might add I’m not loving much new country for the past 10-15 years. I’m very old school. And finally I am sure her husband will have a hissy fit if he reads this but he whine’s about the wind blowing in the wrong direction. Ms. B Carter can do country. But this needs a do over.
The best country song out right now
Is there anything Queen Bey can't do. Well now you know HATERS why she has 33 Grammy's.   Up your a**es😅  b*tches
K Michelle
argh slay. 🤠🐎🔫
This is fantastic! All power to her for exploring numerous genres. Country music definitely has black roots too.  We are here for it!
This does not do it for me 😂 Does not even sound like a pop country to me. That'll be a big no from me.
I can't wait until the official line dance! There is no genre Beyonce can't masterpiece.
Well if anyone is going to do it let it be Beyonce!!
I love this song ❤️
a própria indústria lançando álbum!
Parece o mesmo cabelo do teaser de I’m that girl 😮❤
Assim gente, sempre achei o country muito sexy, cowboys e tals ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❣️
Mulher, só consegui prestar nesses peitchos. Que bixa linda. Te amo 💖
Ayee she finna have errybody on they country shi
Sou muito fã do country sim, nunca decepciona mesmo. I love you mama ❤
Yall should go listen to k Michelle country love song as well it’s good
This ain’t Texas!!!
❤
It’s one thing to not have an appreciations for Country music and another to not feel appreciated about a genre culturally. …It’s not that Black folks don’t like Country music, the (mainstream) culture of it has not been welcoming to, has pushed out Black folks. …I’m so looking forward to Beyoncé opening these doors a bit with her influence AND dare us to step into a world some Blacks are already occupying. …There are Black Country artists. Cheers to exploration of our history and discovery of our present presence.
❤❤
❤
I'm looking forward to seeing the line dances that start trending to this

I like! Keeping on repeat! Thank you for sharing, Beyoncé. I want to line dance to this! :) 13feb24
Love it
OK Beyoncé this is 🔥
I’m officially a Taylor Swift Fan 😂
Has she just ran out of stuff to do?? I love Bey, but this isn’t it for her imo.
Queremos ela em BARRETOS 2024 E VILA MIX BRAZIL
Beyonce can still turn out bangers - She is a hell of a performer - But this is trash.
I love country this just took it up a notch. Waiting for the dance.Daddy Lessons was definitely one of my fav songs. 🥹😍
I guess she doing country now so she can get that album of the year from Taylor. Bey leave the country to Taylor. K. Michelle’s country songs hit. I’m confused. It sounds like a mash up. Like someone took one of your regular songs and ran it over a country instrumental. I’m good.
I love country always have and I love that she killed it!   Sounds like the original country ( us brothas and sistas ) started
this is one of the best releases in 2024
Well played, Bey! Well played! ♟️
Gonna need a duet with Dolly at some point
Can't wait to see the hoedown live
Hot take: it was cool to feature Rhiannon Giddens on Banjo, but the song would have been better had she just let Rhiannon sing lead on the song.
Three amazing children and her body looks that perfect... My mother said my sister took away her nice boobs..... What's Bey secret to keeping hers pefect.....
Like this comment for no reason 😊😊
This is soo goodd😍😍😍😍😍
love u ❤
Can this be real? I just now became a country music fan. Totally totally hot song!
I've always been a huge Country Music fan!!  Hat and all!!  Just married to a Westside Chicago Ninja, and it doesn't go well with him!! (Laughing hard)  Beyonce gives it an amazing twist....  I love it!!  Even though as a Nubian Queen, I perfer Country,  R-Kelly, and Bon jovey!  I know I'm a San Diego melting pot!  But again, way to go, Bey, you're an outstanding Queen!  Your grind is untouchable!  Let's stay focused Black/ African people ALL OVER THE WORLD 🌎  Love all.....
Mama bringing country to the mainstream 😊😊😊
🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽🩷🩷🩷🩷
Iiiirrá Let's go Bey !! 🤠
Slaps
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She did it AGAIN!!!
Alternative country vibes courtesy of Beyonce. Can't wait to hear the rest of the project. ✨
What??
Boom just like that  I'm singing country 💜🎶🎶🎶🎶
Now my cowgirl boots have meaning and reason bey-haw🐝
😂damn, my dance switch just automatically turns on. Suddenly my head 😳 is losing it.
So she depleted the rap-r&b markets and utlizies new horizons
I can’t wait to see the dance we /us create off if this
This is atrocious. Horrible song. Bleached white skin on a black woman. Unnecessarily naked. Dumb video. Promoting guns in 2024. 😳 Really tacky. Really bad. Please make it go away.  This can’t be the official video. The same dumb posing on loop?
She’s felt like doing a country music will eventually help her get that Grammy award for Best album that is missing so much in her career.
Yasssss Yassss Y
O-kayyy Bey!!! Love your music and Im a BIG country music fan so Im loving this new music!!❤👏👏 Cant wait for the video!!
Ushers half time show should have trumped this project not beyonces best
They are going to figure out a way to say this isn’t country watch
Houston we have another ONE. #TexasBaby. 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾I see you Bey, I love it, im here for it
This is not country
Okay now! ❤
Is the first time I see her so vulgar
Its still popular in 2030
DAMMMMNNN I didn’t like act i. But this, ❤❤❤❤❤. She’s doing it up !!
❤
Yeah well that's definitely not country 😂
Congrats Rhiannon Giddens for the very cool banjo part ! Best part of the song !
On repeat <3
I don't know how the rest of that album will sound, but got damn this one here is definitely to be reckoned with💣💣💣
Aaaaa
The video (costume) and cuss are unfortunately wrong for this genre, but if this appeals to her base and helps her reach a new audience, then good on her.
Pew pew 🔫
I always loved country music but i see the queen is taking country music to another  level i smell smoke.👍🔥🔥🔥
Was always a country music fan so bring it on! ❤
Country music doesn't suit her.
Bey own every GENRE!!! Real QUEEN!!! 😭💖💖💖💖
Y’all I’ve been SOBBING from yesterday!!!   And it’s almost my moon time which makes sense too   I’m a double threat I fear 😭😭😭😭
Yall better learn how to linedance . I knew my love for country music would come in hand one day
Good way to go Beyonce, white people vote for Grammy winners, you'll get album of the year👌🏽
Yaaasss❤
Yaaaassssss 🔥🐝🔥🐝🔥
I like this song. Ok, Bey!! Let me get my cowboy hat and outfit ready!
Damn I haven’t heard a catchy Bey song in a long time
I'm not a fan y'all
Beyonce has answered the challengers to her Crown by reviving Black creation of Country Music with a simple gospel dancing stomping classic song that has no doubt about it being a Master stroke by the Queen .
Proud to be Texan
Why is she white
Xyinija высшего уровня 😏👍 ...кроме сисей ничего хорошего😏
taylor swift
Probably best genre for her voice…I am not a fan of the artist but I love this sound for her voice. I am also a country girl. More like a village girl who wish she was country.
She’s reclaiming the genre because she can do it, because she’s Beyonce, because she’s a genius, a mastermind, and she’s changing the world to make it a better place.
Beyoncé so dam sexy idk how Jay-Z cheat on her.
Finally the return of That Beyonce. The only one with the country sound inside! Stop with commercial music. Sing songs like this one and with some r&b. ❤ Love you, 👑.
Masterpiece ❤
Nahh she tryin to hard
😆😂 cowgirls do not dress half naked, she's trying to hard to get the attention she thought she was going to have forever, this song is boring, what a disrespect to the real woman artist of country music.
Thaa QUEEEEEEN !🎉🎉🎉
My whole life, I knew she'd find a way to make me have interest in her. Love a country bop!
I prefer 16 Carriages. But this is cute. The amount of mad white men in the comment section 😂. It’s expected of course.
1:57 💃🏿🎩🐴🎸🔂
I never thought this Brooklyn/ Trini boi would feel the way I do hearing this. Moms raised me on country and I had to learn every other genre to fit in. I now feel at home. Thanks B!
Apunta aprieta bummm
The red neck’s gonna mad lol
bull shit
SHES PULLING A GAGA YAAASSSSSSS
💜💚💜🩷💙💛👌💚💚🩷💜💙💚🩷🫶👌💫
This works! Sounds great, Get your Country Grammy Mrs Carter!
Sounds country and gospel idk how to explain it but i dig it
Woke people, please explain to me, Beyoncé showing half of her boobs is that a woman being free to do whatever she wants with her body, oder is it a matter of cheap old "sex sells"? Btw, this is a serious question. She doesn't need that
nice. beat makes you wanna dance.
Wow we really just let Bey do whatever she wants now, huh?
This is great texas hold em .🤩
She is a married woman, she has no business being this sexy.
I'm not here for it . We are supposed to be dancing country style in France too just cause it Q B.  Let me listened to her other catalogue. I hope you genuinely like this song and not cause it's Beyonce... Still love here though
WHAT the ACTUAL fark!! STOP bastardising the good ol boys Bae
Trashy af. The symbolism is right in ya face as well. Can't stand her.
This is so goooood!
Beyoncé can you please do like a master mind class behind just your mind and your vocals and how you come up with your lyrics and melody’s and idea for you photos shoots and promotions please? Like I just want to see you in action and how deep your Genius is? You’re so beautiful and brilliant I just want to connect deeper with you!
Well, everyone is complementing but I don't like it 🤷 I think her voice fits beautifully here but the song itself is very repetitive and the accent on some phrases is too much so it turns annoying..sorry, I'm going to say - No.
BEYONCÉ.........ok girl ❤🎉
This is amazing!!!!! Beyoncé is the GOAT and can sing, record, and perform ANYTHING!!!! Love this!!!
Nice to hear Beyonce cross over a bit. This song is great!!  Good job Beyonce!!!
Something wrong with her?
🤠 yeahhhhawww
This could have been the soundtrack to one of those mediocre movies that have an amazing soundtrack.
I like the arrangement and the fact that her lead voice has minimal effects.  Well down. Clever and creative work.
Its like contemporary bluegrass jigg, loving it ❤
Let’s go, Cowgirl Bey!!!🤠🔥🔥🔥🤘🏽
We have the visuals this time!
I'm obsessed with you Queen I got my boyfriend mad that's how much I care & love you you will forever be the on & only is Beyonce N***🤑🔥🙇🏻‍♂️
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The racist communities right now😂😂😂
🐝 🐝 🐝 ❤❤ love it ..can't wait for the album ...beyonce don't miss
Rhiannon Giddens will add something special to any song❤
Is she trying to mess w/ Taylor Swift?🤔
This is smoother than butter, oh my! I'm not a country fan but I'm running to the floor when this comes on.
GYAT
Shoutout Rhiannon Giddens 👏 Clawhammer banjo 🪕
❤ the album I didn't know I needed 😍😍😍😍😍
People crazy saying this song and 16 carriges arent both fantastic songs...i love this one ❤
Country Song that makes you dance.❤
Fake
Trash
❤❤❤❤hell yeah Bey🎉
OLHA A BOIADEIRAAAAA
Jay Z is the luckiest man alive.
Not memorable at all
What is this weirdo on??!  "there's a tornado in my city, hit the basement that shit aint pretty."
I love Rhiannon Giddens' banjo riff at the beginning.
With Rhiannon Giddens supplying backup banjo and viola
Dedicated to Taylor Swift maybe?😂😂😂 You went Pop, watch me go country!!
Song ist geil,nur Video paßt überhaupt nicht dazu
This ain't country though is it 😂 she hasn't got the voice for country 🤷‍♀️
Yes ❤
Uma delícia de se escutar
Don't be a bi%ch come take it to the floor now. 🎵
Warum immer halb nackt
Never was a country fan but damn girlll this is GOOD 🔥
Boy, I need some country boots that are easy on the toes! Git, git👢🤠
As are a fan of country music and a Beyhiver, this project is just the perfect marriage for me and I love it.  Thank you, Beyoncé... Let's go!!!
I love this woman n she just made me love her more 😩❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Beyoncé !!!! You never cease to amaze us 😭

A Sula Miranda do Texas... 💙💙💙 Não vejo a hooooora! 😃  O act iii deveria ser todo rock, só acho...
wow...
Boring
Country music replaced by trash. You are not a true country music fan if you support this trash. Tractors, trucks, honky tonks, family and  "down home" replaced by boobs! This is an insult to genuine country music. The immoral garbage of the world is spreading everywhere.
Yaaassss queen❤❤❤
Perfeita, Deusa...
see y’all country bars in Texas will  smoke 💨 out of this queen 💧 😂
So soothing, but you can still cut a rug. Love it!!!
Why's her chest flickering in the close-up
RESPECT TO THE QUEEN B❤

I love this!!
This is awful
Maybe now she’ll win album of the year
This is a gorgeous song. All of it. The rhythm, the lyrics, her voice! It makes me think of many great black musicians such as Big Mama Thornton, Robert Johnson, Charley Pride. It’s like an homage to the greats! love THIS Beyonce!
Tbh I love country music, and this is awesome ❤

It definitely different.   I’m not fan but let’s see what she does.  I’m definitely gone see who she bring with her.
The woman is from TEXAS 💥💥💥💥💥
She is really desperate! What is her reason to look like this and dress like this with this song! This doesn’t looks country! Disrespectful for Country female singers! She dress for a strip club!  Looking Cheap! Bless her heart! She should be ashamed to dress like that being a mother ! She have giving her soul to Satan! Smh  it ashamed for female to dress like this to get attention 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦🏾‍♂️
Lol, "dont be a bitch, come take it to tha flow now"
Let's go queen B👑
And the Grammy for best country song Beyoncé 🎉
It was about time for her country era! I’m here for it 🫶🏽😍
What can’t she do?! Like respect the talent she is blessed with. I still think she my cousin 😂
Oh yeah I like this 🎧
DEVOOOOUUUUUREEEEEEEEEEEEED
I hope she collabs with the War and Treaty!
Love the new country songs. And love that she's going back to her Texas roots. Cant wait for the album March 29th
Bey just solved all my problems with these new 2 drops
Ok B we here for it ❤
Hey Jay-z, guess what?? Bey isn’t going to win anything with this song either 😆🥲🤣😂
this has a country theme, but it ain't country genre, she don't got that country twang. still not a terrible song
Sounds like 💩
I don’t really like the chorus but apart from that it’s good
I love country music. But this is a bad joke 😂
Y not 🐝 ❤
Catching up with country era. 😂 lady gaga already did it with Joanne 😂
Cute lyric “Dont be a bitch”… but how ‘bout “I ain’t a bitch”!!! By Alaura Lynne!! https://youtu.be/x6Hknl4aRc0?si=Rp7iS2fgxY0rTC5t
De agora em diante, o que vir vai ser histórico. Essa mulher é surreal ✨
Beyoncé é a #1 da indústria
This is new level Country. Remember she's from Texas.
Country??    I did not see that coming…
Y'all, what if Beyonce and Dolly do a collab? I'm here for every second of this new album exclamation mark country is in our roots!
Cowboy hats anyone?!
YESSSS MOTHER IS EATING!!!! CUNTry ALBUM IS COMINGGGG
COME THRU BEY!!!!
here for the ad libs!
I literally have this on repeat ❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE THIS ❤❤❤✊🏿💙💙💙🌹🌹🌹🔥🔥
❤
Not very country sounding but it still sucks
This song shows how much depth Beyoncé has as a singer and artist. This is a very cool country song!
You have it done again bey!!!
The sound of the music is country but the sound of her voice is still r&b soul
A a alien superstar space sheriff??? Lol
As a country fan....it's a no
I can’t believe how many times I actually listened to this song already 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Let me find out beyonce trying to get nominated for cma awards
Every 👏🏾 Single 👏🏾 Genre👏🏾
We just left Club Renaissance now we headed to the hoe down and line dancing at the cookout this Summer. Yee HAw 🤠
I like the direction she’s going! Now represent our Louisiana roots and add some zydeco
Estava tudo planejado ja pelo jay z e Beyoncé no Grammy 😅 ela foi de chapeu country a caráter do novo album, o jay z fez o discurso e poucos dias depois ela lançou o álbum. Isso é para aproveitar os holofotes que ainda circulam em volta do discurso do jay z e agora com o álbum novo pós discurso, sera que ela ganha "álbum do ano"?
❤❤
Bee 🐝 Haw 🤠
I liked daddy lessons.  Idk. Part of me likes old country. Different pain.  She looks great and adds pop flare sounds which is where most country is these days. Good for her. Maybe new folks will give country tunes a chance. We’ll see.
This sounds WWAY BETTER than anything else she has done!! It fits her voice way better. I just don't think her voice is fit for what she has been doing AT ALL.
Monotone reciting of buzzwords with random hey ho's is sooooooo  old this is not good. It's not even country. Of course country hasn't been country for years anyway but really Beyonce? Had to pander to keep up with t. Swift aye? This is super lame and I would've assumed she knew beneath her. But whatever keeps her agents and billionaire husband happy ig
Huge fan✌
People we need to stop being mean to each other. Artists can play and sing whatever they want and explore different music and what not, they are not trying to offend anyone they are just trying to evolve and explore what they like. We all need to call the F down and just let them be. If we don’t like it we just don’t listen to it! It is that simple!
Sexy AF❤💯🥰👍
<3
I don’t enjoy this but I am glad to see that the country scene is becoming more diverse
So good!!!!
tryin some indregients..some cowboy..tired of africans bits..ahhhhha
I didn’t see that coming. That was beautiful. Thank you for that
It’s just the fact that haters actually look up the song just to leave a hate comment 😂😂
Sweettt Home Alabamaaaaa
🔥 📛 👩‍🚒
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
THANKS QUEEN  #DANCEPARTY WE LOVE YOU QUEEN BEY
Yes, I love it. Go Beyonce, you did the darn Thang again. Got me jumping around this house. 🕺 💃 🕺
Oh there you are B!!!!!!
Yeah damn. I read some hate from a “celeb” before I heard it. I’m more of a Solange fan as far as musical genre. More into Neo soul if you will. I’m definitely not a country fan. I grew up hearing my mother listen to it often and never developed a taste for it. However, I respect music in general. I’ve been exposed to a lot as a person with multiple degrees in music and this was executed really well.
Queen!
It's a no for me ...I like k Michelle country song better then this I love Beyonce but bey it's a hard no
Wow obsessed with this track is gives me all the vibes. It's giving sweet tea, in perfect weather, sitting on the porch with people you love
Going to get my Double RL x RRL shirts ready with my boots this summer for her concerts! Let’s Go!
Paylor Swift 👀 looking 👂👂listening ✍️ 📖 taking notes💯
Dog gone it!  Beyonce sounds like she was born in Texas ❤❤❤❤
I like this!!!💥💥💥💥
💃🏾  I’m here for it! 😊
This is Absolutely Amazing ❤❤❤❤
Girl can you come back to r&b please we need u 😭😭 the rap girlies have taken over and all we have is muni long & H.e.r. Isn’t consistent enough for me .
Just in time for the Rodeo 💃🏾🤠🤘🏾👢
At 42 years old after 3 kids she still has a six pack 🤣🤣🤣 I'm 27 and I'm convinced this woman will outlive me
Rainhaaaa rumo ao tope 1 durante mais um ano
Amoooo
I want acoustic. She will kill it
is this so she can go #1 on the country charts and not have to compete with taylor swift?
Wow! I don’t get the video though.
Well it looks like we got to come up with some dance steps to go with this awesome song. ❤️💃🏽🕺🏻
Too bad she has to stoop this low with her wardrobe. A has been desperately trying to be relevant again.
❤❤❤❤❤
Love me some queen bey. Don't care what she sings❤💃🏻❤️💃🏻💃🏻❤️❤️
Trash. Taylor Swift for the win
I love it 🤠
Run it up! Make it #1 @beyonce
She should collab with Renee Rapp on this one 😬
Lmao
I'm here for it!
CMA'S better get it right 8 years later 😠😡
Country music fan here & I’m living for this ❤❤❤
I expected nothing LESS 😄😅😂🤣
her voice is just so delicious
Trying to be a white woman and Taylor swift the world. Retire already, this queen bee is dead.
A MAIORAL
She shooting for the album of the year next year. Shooting for new fans so country music will help her get there. She and J has great marketing ideas
I am loving this new music.  Beyonce check out Jaron a vocal coach review your voice and all of the wonderful things it does.  https://youtu.be/803CiBtaqJA?si=fvDnu5Sbgo2pbRip
Lol it’s crap
Queen of versatility 🔥🔥🔥
Terri joe gon start the live with this
I'm from Argentina and I had never listened to a country song from beginning to the end. That's why I think it's a wonderful idea that Bey shows Country Music to the whole world!
act i - house, disco, ballroom act ii - country, bluegrass, folk. act iii - rock, blues, jazz.  thank you for reclaiming historically black art forms, beyoncé. thank you for always paying homage to the past, crediting and paying people, and pushing the culture forward.   those of us who get it, will ensure that your sacrifices will never be in vain. we love and appreciate you so much. ❤️🥺
I like this
This ish is trash!! Yall got it though
ELA REVOLUCIONAAAAA
I've never been a Beyoncé fan. I like Renaissance but didn't become a Bey fan with it. Now I can't stop listening to these new singles!
Beyoncé could literally make any genre of music and eat it up every time. She’s just Beyoncé, nothing is impossible for her. ❤
She coming for the next award for Album of The Year
K Michelle is going to be mad lol
her Dolly era
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My cousin playing the banjo!! Love it!!!
❤❤❤
I’m not the biggest country fan but it’s Beyonce ❤️🤷🏾‍♀️ anything she sings is a masterpiece.
NOT LOVING IT 😢
Hey. That woman is from Texas. For real. ❤
I love u Beyoncé, I am brazilian singer.
Aaaaannnddd i love all these fake comments on here!! Bunch of fake reviews!!
The song following this is gonna be called “Shoot”
Taylor watch out your man gonna be coming back to the other side after watching sexy Beyonce swiftly shot that finger pistol...love it!!
Funny, I was in Texas yesterday 😅
This is ABSOLUTE TRASH!! THIS IS NOT WHAT COUNTRY IS ABOUT....PLEASE STOP....AND IM SORRY REAL COUNTRY FEMALE SINGERS DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE A HALLOWEEN SHOP PROSTITUTE TO SELL THEIR MUSIC!! SAD SAD REPRESENTATION OF WHAT WAS ONCE GOOD!
Line dance about to eat this up!
🙌👏👏 woooh! Only beyonce can nailed this! 🥰😍🥳
Wow omg
Yeehaw🎉
Waiting on the line dance 🎉
First time I enjoyed a banjo 🪕 😂
I would've never guessed this from Beyonce but I'm not even mad
❤❤❤❤
Já amava country , agora então ❤❤❤
Y’all need to stop this ain’t real country music. She’s a beautiful woman but y’all doing too much at this point.
Beyoncé is expanding her musical interests.
Someone start a Tik Tok dance challenge to this. Love it!!!
The video is so lame! They didn't even try. The song is almost good.
Soooo goood
Wow someone is suffering from an over inflated ego. Really cheaped out on the video, short loop got old real quick. Reminds me of a painter halfassing a piece of work hoping their name will sell it.
I can see this being remixed into a club song like cotton eye joe. Even though I’m not a Bee fan, she did her thing on this song. Even people who are not country fans will like this song. I admire that she’s not afraid to always try something new. She is an innovator.
At least she's not yelling.
Not surprised shes  doing country  She was born in Houston, Tx!  Country's in her blood!  #ProudTexan
The visual... Okkk Bey 💯
I got to really check this out. I’m a 47 black woman, who love all genres of music. And I got a pretty good bit of country on many of my playlists. Music has always been my life. Had I signed long ago, I would’ve been rolling with Mary and Whitney. Now I can’t really hear Bey doing this country , but I will check it out!
Ain't Texas, ain't hold em, ain't country. At least she's dressed appropriately to be a role model.
I'd learning this line dance quick. I almost lost my Black card tying to learn the Tamia Dance lol
Lmao this girl doesn’t know country! does she even know what a cow is 😂😂😂 stop
This song is Beyonce 😍
Slay!!!
Beyonce invented a new genre no one has ever heard before 🥰
All the complaining that comes from her and mostly her husband Jay Z takes away from her and her music makes me not really wanna listen they are never happy even with all the $and "accomplishments "
The video is ridiculous! Put some clothes on! Fun song though
If that was sitting across the table u lose ur concentration 😂
Country music was created by Us
To be a mother of 3 and have been in the business for many years and drop this master class is the reason why we call her a queen
If people only understand the origin of  country music…  the banjo 🪕, yodeling and all… It’s us! Straight from Africa. She clearly understands that. I love it and love her for forcing us to face who we are… musically.🥹❤️🥹
She can't win album of the year, so she changes genre?
I hate country music even more now. Sorry.
I like it! I have been tapping into the countryside regarding our Black musicians.  Reclaim what's ours with a fresh new twist ❤

🤠
Living legend! Anyone that disagrees is an absolute foool.  Her body of work is stellar
I like both songs make me want to put on some cowgirl boots sit on the porch with a glass of lemonade 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This does not sound like a good country song 😮 Sounds like a cheap line dance song. Don’t like the cross over although I’m a big fan. Yall be honest now
I'm not usually a fan of Beyonce but I Love Country music 🥰
Love it!
PLEASE BREAK THRU BEYONCE SO A COUNTRY ALBUM 😍
I love my queeeennn
I love country music specially women in country! I'm so had Beyonce is doing a country album its gonna be SO good
Well, okay. How you should love money. She's missing another Grammy in a category where she hasn't yet won. Megalomania.
My girl mastered this music shit doing what she wanna do period as she should
Don't even ride in my car if you expect to hear anything other than this for at least week
I hate this song and can't stand her. There's never been a song of hers I enjoy listening to and still haven't found it🤷‍♀️🤢
Beyonce been touched down on country one from where she is from and 2 when she sung with the Dixie chicks
OBRIGADO BEYONCÉ 🥹💓💓💓💓💓💓 EU AMEIIIIII
Y'all need to stop the madness this song is pure garbage it's a joke, now I see she'll never get an album of the year award.
I’m a cow girl now
CMA awards, here comes Beyoncé to win big for this one Genius🎶👏🎶
Well now I can put some respect and talent with this song . Just maybe she will a Grammy ,because her music has gone the crapper ,maybe this will be her saving grace
Love this and LOVE that she crossed over helping to heal division in humanity 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
Amo. Que coisa gostosa
I grew up on country and this is just the album to bring me back. I'm following wherever Beyonce goes!
Please don’t ruin country for meeeee 😂
if this is considered country classical music is considered rap
I know a line dance coming 🤠
y’all this is not country music, nothing about this is country music
Sorry, but this isn't it.
FQ!! Jay-Z gonna cry when she doesn't get Album of the Year for this also 😅😅

And then reading these commenta youll gotta be kidding me!!!! Stop acting like Beyonce cant drop hot garbabge .... this song is a NO.... youll juat take anything
LMAO

Isn't the Renaissance album a 3 disc album cause this all could be from the second disc of the same album. Just a theory.
Ateee down ❤❤
Dancers of the Internet get your Choreo together and letsssssss goooooooo!
If you’ve never listened to country music, you have been missing out.
Brilliant.
Creo que me leí todos lo comentarios buscando la letra :/
That’s MOTHER and y’all better know it ✨

Beyoncé being teasing us since Daddy Lessons that she was exploring country music. I like this song.
Great Song 🎶  & Singer 🎙️Disappointed with the Clip  🎥 (Repeated)   Beyoncé Girlfriend Where’s your Dance 💃🏽 Moves 🤔
Daddy Lessons song, go people, and stop talk like is the first time she does it.
Love some country. This right right here is ❤❤❤.
eu to sendo mais detalhista q ela ou to loco que ela tremeu um pouco os dedos subindo do bolso?
Love the song
Ok Beyoncé you did your damn thing with that country song I love it
Lol! She's ridiculous 😂😂😂   It's so horrible
Amei, não erra nunca
Country music lik Rock comes from Afro americans so I know she will perform, j'adore en tout cas, j'ai hâte que tout sorte 🥰
WHEW 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
This sucks
I love this song ❤ it feels so fresh and beautiful. Beyoncé’s voice goes well with guitar
Beyoncé representing San Marino at Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö with this song.... how do we make that happen???
This heffa getting ready to takeover every genre of music. I hope she does this album like she did Black Is King and get the artist already doing it some more shine. There’s a lot of black people making great country music
Why ???
Love country love Beyonce and love Beyoncé’s country!
I came for Rhiannon Giddens' banjo and viola, and this is fabulous.
love it
Omg I love this 🥰
Oh gawd. She’s gonna try to ruin country too? Cant she just stick to mediocre pop?
I like it, Id like to see it end a little quicker, its gets weird at the end, off track
this song sounds like it belongs on a dairy farms commercial. just goofy.
So when’s the Orville Peck collab?
Dumpster fire. The lack of talent and production value of modern music is shameful.
This ain’t country! I can hear that Northern accent. And she grew up in SOUTHWEST
I’m foaming at the mouth for this, I’ve just recently gotten into country music so this is perfect!!!
And she wants album of the year with this  trash 🗑🗑 😂
LMAO name a HIP HOP artist Beyonce Name a R&B artist Beyonce Name a Country artist Beyonce best artist award goes to Beyonce. Makes sense if you ask me.
Yeehawww girliesss
🤍
🖤
❤
PQP mulheeeeeeeeeerrrrrrr
This is pop not country. Nice song tho
I am suddenly a country fan
El country es el Regional Mexicano de Estados Unidos 🤭  Me gustó la canción ❤
AHH BEYONCE  I SEE U!! BEYONCE IS THE BEST MUSIC ARTIST❤❤
i like country now
This is not country music, this is just another celebrity that thinks they can switch genres of music. If you want country music go with Marty Robbins, George Strait, Dolly Parton and all the other greats. Stay in your lane  beyonce
❤🇧🇷
Patrona!
beyhaw 🤠
😂 lordy the video is terrible. shes always had a great voice but this song is not it. def wont win that album of the year her hubby thinks she deserves. she needs to stick to her genre and step up her game in order to win that coveted album of tge year. she has good songs but a handful of good songs per album does not make an album of the year.
Are y'all gonna buy this album? If you ask me it's still Beyoncé  music . Just calling it country lol
My inner country girl wishes the ending had a harmonica with Beyonce Yodeling at the end.  A girl coukd dream. Maybe on a live performance.
Another Dam hit and I am here for it.
love beyonce, hate this
❤❤❤❤
Stream actii 😊❤
I need a music video for this like Nowwwwww😢
Beyonce is a musical...genius hate her all you want. My girl is going to stay relevant. And I am here for it. 👑
On repeat 😍
In class all her own! ❤
I LOVE THIS IS
The 🐝 hive is creating lines dances RIGHT NOW😅😂
Ohhhh sis said I'm showing out I can't wait Beyonce is back love it
her vocal isn't that great
People on CLUBLEXUS be stuck like... 😅
Repeated *pow , pow* I'm here for whatever she has ❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂
Tell me this… why does Queen Bey always winnnnn?
Nope
Oh Texas Hold 'Em don't end 16 Floprriages like that
Once a cowgirl always a cowgirl 🤠
me adotaaaaaaa
If Beyonce like country i like country 😍😍😍
She's just making music for fun now.
119K Yoncé
This sucks!!!😂😂 got to be kidding me! This is a POS😅
I’m a huge country fan song is ok but not the video
did I talk to you and I didn't know it so many assassins and detectives I b trippin
Beyonce all day every day!
She's not even coming close to Chaple Hart,Kane Brown,Darius Rucker,Coffie Anderson 👎👎👎👎
Ok yesss!
Hopefully, this isn’t the official video for the track. Why the state of undress? The song sounds great without the half naked visual. Anyone who can’t enjoy great music unless it’s accompanied by half naked women, such an individual is a perverted individual and artists don’t need to cater to such people’s warped preferences. Most times, audiences and viewers simply wish to listen to great music.
The way I absolutely love this song 😭
❤❤❤❤❤
She coming for Taylor I’m a Virgo I know this she wants that album of the year bad
It's ok. I like the song, but her voice is not country... she needs to add some rasp...
There’s nothing she can’t do 😂😍
🗑️
ela sabe que é a melhor
Took me back to my down south youth ❤❤❤
Great song! Horrible video, my brain is rebelled after 30 seconds.
❤❤❤❤❤
DIVAAAAAAAAA
They're not gonna let her in cause country music is not this vulgar.
Gente , eu amei!!! ❤
Is it just me??? I don't like it.
Yall sleeping on country music.
hi b
Let’s see how this one end up in the r&b categories at the grammys 🤡
3:27 Know that I'm feeling like I'm in heaven
🤠💃👍
Beyonce ' got me doing the ho' down🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honest fire
All the “I don’t like country music but I’m a fan now” comments 🙄 why? Cause it’s Beyonce 😑 this is a nice song but there are a bunch of actual country songs way better. Stop being so closed minded when it comes to music. Don’t be a sheep and hate a genre of music just because other people say it’s corny. Country music(anything prior to 2010 😂) is good. Like any genre of music out now, U just have to listen to the good old days
Dive bars are nice. 😅🤷‍♀️
Now, where are the last photos from the final 3 shows of the Renaissance tour? THIS IS SO LIT! SHES BREAKING THE INTERNET YET AGAIN! AND DURING THE SUPER BOWL!
This gonna be the country song of summer 2024 watch 🤠
this is a hit - deal with it
I’ve been here since daddy’s lessons 🕘💬!
Reminds me of Daddy lessons.  I like it
I feel so blessed to be alive at the same time as Beyoncé… able to love, enjoy, experience every single era and genre she’s explored/shared with us. I’ve seen her 8x live and she is truly iconic. 🥹🖤  thank you Queen 🐝
I'm sorry! But, this is not good country song, and I've listened to this twice. Beyonce should hang out with Reba McIntyre and Wynonna Judd and get some tips on country music.
I hate country, but this is good.
What the hell is she wearing?
I love she still sings like her just to a country beat. She really can do anything!  I'm excited for this!
Masterpiece Music Arts Beyonce Well Done ♍💯
Now we know she cant sing country either.
flop. its giving RnB over a country beat. that does not a country music make.
I am so happy to be apart of the beehive since 97 the evolution is real
I love how she's creative in transitioning her artistry...to different Levels. 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
never knew i liked country fr
I love Coun-Bey 🥰🔥
Sounds like gospel.
I’m thinking of the writing process, and Beyoncé is probably like “what’s a dive bar?” She doesn’t say it out loud, just thinks it as to not anger her handlers
Her yeehaw era has arrived!!
This is not good
Come on Beyoncé getting me back in my Texas Boot Scoot ERA!!! Love love her!! ❤❤❤
Back to the roots. Bravo, Beyoncé!
This is definitely not country. 😂
Yas, Ok Queen B, I love this!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
And just like that im into country
The video is terrible! A country clip should always have horses or something that reminds you of Country! Also I feel like the entire song was so repetitive....
😂🎉z
Man don't lie this fire 🔥
Isso tá melhor que Taylor Swift ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Não acompanho muito a Beyoncé, mas desde que escutei essa música simplesmente amei! Muito boa, mami.✨✨✨👏👏👏👏
The song is ok, but the outfit is just dumb..
Hey Bey..this song is "LIT"
TEXAS HOLD 'EM (Official Visualizer)
Queen of Music
You should not have used the word bitch in the song. No self-respecting country music star is going to call anybody a bitch in a song. If you want to break out into the country music scene then please to respect the music. However, I love country music, but I can’t stand pop Country and this falls under the genre of pop Country.
She’s one of the hardest working people alive. I love her so much she is amazing. I love her for everything she does.❤❤
It's good, y'all!
Don’t be a bitch come take it to the floor now 👸🐝
😂😂😂 She's a joke
So ready for act ii to DROP!!!! Love this and 16 Carriages. Had to grab my cowboy boots and scoot around the house a LITTLE BIT with this one!!!! Yes!
This heffa getting ready to takeover every genre of music. I hope she does this album like she did Black Is King and get the artist already doing it some more shine. There’s a lot of black people making great country music
THIS IS SO 2011 LADY GAGA STOP IT
When someone can sing, perform and dance at a top tier level like this—the only name that comes up is Beyonce. When someone is a mediocre singer, performer, bad dancer and white—several names come up. The most obvious is Taylor Swift.
Crap 😅
They don’t call her the Queen for nothing!! She can do it all!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🤠
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
THIS WILL WIN HIM AN ALBUM OF THE YEAR IN GRAMMY 👏👏👏👏💯💯🎉🎉🎉🇵🇭♥️♥️❤️
Jay Z is a lucky man lol.
beyoncé is so back
AMO 👑👑👑🐝🐝🐝🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
What the hell is this?
She sounds sensational
In my Simon's voice; It's a NO for me this is just horrible.🙄😑🤦🏽‍♀️
New country music fan checking in
anyway black
Her body looks beyond amazing 😮
Beyonce Playing country music is everything I can't get enough of it .
I wonder if she will win album of the year now 😂😂😂
Leave country alone smh
I have silver cowboy boots.. We ride at dawn..  love it
Beyonce about to turn out the country fans.....
Brilliant
Stay out of Country music!!!! 👎
This is great because the country genre respects older women.
https://youtu.be/vR5eTTVKbhg?si=4NyfNPWjf0Qlr7Go Sun by beyonce

Up next: Polka
Queen forever Queen 👑
And the punchline is that Bey can credibly give a country performance...get Dolly on the phone ASAP...Imagine THAT duet.
Suena MUY BIEN. GRACIAS!♥
Eww 😂
you're a mother and what 40 odds ? dress you're age 🤢
How is she gonna make me like country music? I hate country music. But  she's giving me a reason to love it. DAMMIT BEYONCÉ!!! LOL
She said y'all can forget I'm a Southern gal if ya want to 😋😋🤠🤠🐎🐎🐄🐄👢👢
2:06 Lol, goodbye, Taylor Swift.
It’s the TUMBLEWEED SLIDE❤…. Work me in the middle… I can see her twirling down to the floor and sweeping it with her ass ❤❤❤  Loved the song
This song just proved that Taylor Swift is better than her in all musical genres.
I just wanna know when the dance drop 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
She can do anything. So cool.
Ok Bey... I see u
Super unexpected, and I'm loving country for Beyonce. The Queen! 🤠🐝🐝👑👑👑
1 song & I'm really thinking about finding a cowboy hat that'll fit my fro.
Beyonce could string a turd and play it as a harp, and ya'll would love it. Smdh
❤
Nervous to ask darling was that blue ivy on them vocals?
Not a fan!!!!!!

Worst song ever
This album might just make me a country fan after all
Love it😊
*Never thought I’d hear Beyoncé sing country.*
There’s so many good black country artist out there guys they just not putting them on the radio!
Hey, we need a country line dance for this. Hell, for the whole album!!! I’m here for invading the western bars asking for Beyoncé.
I love this 😊❤
Boooooo!!!! 🗑️🤠 Where is Dolly Parton? I guess she’s going to strip now to be relevant.
YEAH !!
Im Rec. Texas Holdem player :) Love the Song :)
Really feeling this song!! Beyonce can sing every genre! >333
❤
She has more trust in that jacket than I do in myself
Beyonce dropping a country album wasn not on my 2024 bingo card. The chosen songs to set the stage for the album has me compelled what the rest sounds like
NO, just Hell NO!
We need a line dance somebody create one!!
Beyoncé hasn't made one good song in her career. This song is awful.
This is better than the other one
I love Beyonce
I'm with u b for life happy music
Gross
Very good music. Love the instrumentals and vocals from Nigerian🇳🇬
Presenting Beyonce Kardashian 😂

Bey giving us Cajun blues and I want more more more  Time for us girls to bring out the honky tonk in all us with beyonce
ION know Bey,  this may be it.  Country girl!
I just wish the wasn’t a whistle break in the middle. Whistling hurts my ears even when it’s accompanied by Beyoncé.
Houston always coming thru. We love you!
I can see Beyonce performing this at the Grand Ole Opry
She commands every room she’s in 😍
her and tracy made me change my mind about country music
been listening to Daddy Issues wishing for another similar
Oh this is actually the good country.
Here in 2024 see you in 2034 ❤❤
Well this isn’t child friendly
I hate country music, so the Country album theme is disappointing for me. This song doesn’t do nothing for me. But I love Beyoncé I’m sure she will kill it.
I Hate Country and now i Love It!  Her voice is addictive don't matter  the sound, Queen B still Killin It!🖤🤍
I’m good I’m so confused smh
When RnB meets Country done by the best. 🎉
❤❤❤like beat beat
Cowboy bebop vibes Bey I see you.
I love music country but now I love even more and this woman too! 🥰🥰🥰My forever Queen! ❤
This got me boot scootin’ and I don’t even listen to country! I’m a country MF nowwww
Oh okkkk
The Grammys this year is going to be an epic battle
Alright now Bey! Get it girl!🔥🔥🔥
🙄
Why am I having to look at titties for a country song?
It is an authentic sound, because she is from Texas, however this will not sell to country music purists.
Dammmmmn 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Why why always NaKED. I am so Tried of Beyonce always been naked, being this naked some how does not match here status 😭😭😭
Period!!
Maravilhosa entregou com tudo
Beyonce can you do a country project with Chapel Hart????  Who made the cowboy hat Beyonce wore to the Grammys? I want one!
satan
Amazing ❤
Sua safadaaaaaa! ❤🔥
She is everything and more ! This is a masterpiece and she is a genius . She is the Queen of music no matter the genre ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
She is  the industry!
Definitely get artist of the year with this album I love country
Nossa "cauguéu"
Its a good song but why does she think she has to be half dressed to sell it??
Holy crapy of awesomeness! Yeahh Women!...
OK. Not feeling it & not buying it. Thanks Bey.
She said I’m bored, let’s make a country album real quick 🔥🔥🔥
This is a joke? Right?
Quero cantar, bora aprender a letra

What CANT Be do?!😊
♠️
❤❤
Love u
OK. I'm feeling this song... but: does anyone know when this "next-to-naked "asthetic is going to go out of style?   I wish artists/labels would trust the audience to love the music without _visual bribes_.
Can't wait for the line dance💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Forever 🩷🩷💕💕💖
She killed this. I done played this 2 times in a row so far. 😂❤
I love that Beyoncé embraces country! Her voice fits so well with the genre, I never forget how hard she killed “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks!
Thank u ❤
💚💚💚💚💕💕💕🩷🩷🩷
Not me wanting a cowboy to hoedown with 😢

i didnt think i could love beyonce anymore than i already did. ❤
https://youtu.be/odTDgM40YW0?si=_ITKfvl5INaXWkyu
Beyonce has a way of letting fans know which direction she is going on her album. I believe Beyonce dressed at the Grammy
Ummmm... Nawww.
Ok it's official this song is stuck in my head 😮 I aint from Texas either...its hit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏽
Sounding more country than today's "country artists"!
LOVE!!!
I love country & her but this really isn’t giving country other than the beat 🤷🏽‍♀️
QUEEN
Já pensou a Lady Gaga sair de dentro do carro com ela❤ a continuação
YAAAASSSSS
The Internet would BREAK if Bey, SZA and Megan did a music vid together. That's on FACTS! 💯
Damn this kinda hott😂.. I’m not even a country fan.. this a bopp.. this about to be at all the cookouts now😅😂😂
I hope you put the video out BEFORE we have all heard this a million times. I love it!
Taylor Swift always winning a Grammy for country. Beyoncé said it’s her turn now 🤣🙌🏽‼️
Am begging you guys please
I dont know theres something definitely signature Beyonce  here and i wish the lyrics were deeper or something. Its new but sounds like something shes done before. Not gagged i wont lie. And her vocals are too perfect for me it makes her sound insincere. I totally get why she hasnt wont album of the year honestly .
I really wanted to like this but  The song itself is terrible Any song that throws country lingo in lyrics is just too cheesy
Those Africans are fools
I can't do it
All of you should leave me alone
This ain't country it's just country instrumental
This is popping off😂 it only had 20k views in 2 hours
Katt Williams, man attacks judge, now Beyoncé a country singer #2024isMessy  😂
This isnt fucking country
QUEEM? BEE
Slides that baphomet pose in :|
We really miss this music
All American rap artist need to leave me alone for atleast another 15years
YA LA VI NOMINADA A BEST POP SOLO PERFORMANCE Y MEJOR CANCIÓN R&B 😂
She really  need to leave me alone
She looks white or is it me?
😂 I been dabbing into country music now I’m all the way here 😂

Love this masterpiece and ready for the Renaissance Tour Act II
Don't let me find out I love country music now 😩 ... Bey I can't wait to learn the line dance for this one!
mas satanica no ¿no?
The banjo here is played by Rhiannon Giddens, who is amazing and I hope everyone gives her a listen
Enjoying this music
Dolly Parton Forever Beyonce Never!!!!
Taylor ain’t the only “country” singer ya dig. Give the goat her Aoty ya heard
LMAO
This was probably the simplist, easiest video Beyonce has ever done, and yet its STILL one of her hottest, and video of the year nominee just because of how sexy, and hot she looks
The way I been line dancing throughout the day like I was born in the south is crazy but I’m here for it.
Jesus, the b*tch is perfection. Hoops spurs boots 🎶
B took advice from JT 😂 beyoncé should do a country album n might receive album of the year
HORRENDOUS
She channeled Dolly Parton on this one…perfect!
🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹
Aside from Carrie Underwood, I'm not a country fan, but...Beyonce!!!!!! Girl, you got me in a whole new state of mind with this! ❤
Is that Rhiannon Giddens playing banjo!? LOVE HER.
Bey is back to her roots. If anyone knew Bey, you would know she always loved her country.
I love beyoncé but this song ain't it
I can’t wait for the new album !!!
YeeHaw!!! BeyBey!!! Lovin' You Always!!! 🤠🥰🤩😍
Now hold on a root’n toot’n MINUTE here.
Hope she collab with Chapel Hart!!! Would love to see it. The Queen got us listening to country music in 2024
Having a Beyoncé country line dance hit wasn't something I anticipated for 2024 😂, but count me in for the fun!
Keep bringing that wow factor!
YESSSSS B!!!!! DO A COUNTRY ALBUM!!! Come on B!!!!! DOMINATE!!!!!! Bring it home for THEFAM!!!!

Does Not Sway Far From Her Roots, TEXAS ❤
WHO IS IT ???  it's BEE😉😉🐝❤
Eu tenho um sonho é ver a beyonce em uma turnê no Brasil 🇧🇷

The day I see Dylan dressed like this to perform, we will have reached equality.  How this is called a feminist I cannot fathom.
YEEEEEHAWWW
Better than Taylor   Take as a joke but I really mean it
Huge move towards the mark. Much love. I needed this, your turn. Pour it up!
I love this ❤

This is really dope!
You go girl !!!!
She had these elements on the lemonade album! So I’m super excited! She kills mann! ❤❤🎉
Pop ur lexus? Is this music solely for the upper class now Beyonce? Hate that shit. What is this an add for the rich?
You couldn’t have pulled this off earlier in your career and have it translate as wonderfully to your fans as it has this day, but I hope you don’t think it’s late, cause baby it’s right on time. ✨
Fabulous ❤⭐️⭐️⭐️
I just need a music video with  Beyoncé choreography for an amazing line dance
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Essa mulher não paraaaaaaaa graças a Deus ❤
Leave me alone
If anyone gets to touch me?
Leave me alone
Ima support my girl through and through, but I’ve never been a country fan tbh. The genre has a couple of songs that are bops that I couldn’t escape because of how popular they were, but i’ll wait and see
Not everyone who used to talk 💩 about country music now a fan 😂😂
What da fuck
How can be home for months

I can't move the fuck
They are in my house and everywhere fucken place

Great song but I don't need to see her bare chest.

So people still thinking she ain’t a fraud ? just a coincidence she is jumping on country music ? 😂
Bastered

Y2K fools
Major edit on the chest area
Bastered
They should go thank Steven for creating apple
Eu tô amando isso ❤❤❤ beyoncé mulheeeeeeer
Beyonce is really aiming for all the categories 😅
Ok so just like 16 carriages this is brilliantly produced, sung and “curated” by her or by her team but if this is Bey reappropriating country music, the fact that both those songs were actually written by white artists (here Elizabeth Lowell Boland and Megan Bülow) is puzzling.
Queen ♥️🚀
Tell Kelly and Jay z that
Congratulations you are beautiful Beyoncè you are a love you are love l love you you are alvays in my heart my love Beyoncè ❤💋 ❤💋🌹 ❤🌹 ❤🌹 ❤💋 ❤
Apple is your savours
Leave me alone
Why did she bother to wear clothes??
THERE'S NOTHING THIS QUEEN CAN'T DO..... BEYOND THANKFUL 2 BE LIVING IN REAL TIME OF THIS REMARKABLE QUEEN  .
Mother
Let me know when y'all got the line dance ready so I can practice
Finally something different

Beyoncé nunca decepciona 😊
I don't like guns and is not by force
Maybe I do like country music hol on now 🤠
Leave me alone
Sorry. That's not country and that's not what a country girl wears. This is just some more new bull@@@@ that people are trying to pass of as country. I bet Loretta Lynn is turning in her grave right now.
What nonsense
This is amazing
I live with an airport and can't fly?
I like this! I like country anyway but  now let me get my coins and outfit together for the next tour 😂😂
Mother you need to come up with a catchy easy square dance for this please. It’ll be a HIT.
I need to use the airport in my neighborhood
Am getting really really fucken upset, this is not fun at all, am taking it fucken serious

Great music but she looks terrible, I guess she's trying to play catchup, given that her old style is out of fashion now.
Leave me alone, leave my fucken records alone ,
Guess il be shopping for some chaps over lunch getting ready for the show.  This is fire!!
Or am going to tell you fuck husband a thing of his life
I love it!! I knew when she sang with the legendary Chicks it was on and poppin!! ,👏💜🎉🤩
Honestly, I liked Destiny's Child songs. When Beyoncé went solo, it didn't appeal to me as much. I've admired her career, but it wasn't music I listened to on Spotify, except for 'Irreplaceable'... This song, in my opinion, is one of Beyoncé's best as a solo artist; her voice is perfect just the way it is.
Leave me the fuck alone
Am telling you, I am out of your childhood , I don't creat music by following anyone around
Leave me alone
Que música gostosinha ❤😍
Since the year 2013 in clubs in Madrid and parts of Valencia there has been alot of shooting
As an Equestrian, this is awful and she should stay in the pop lane. Ya don't make you country at all. And if you think this is country, Maranda lambert, that's country...lol  I would love to see her have that crap on unloading hay😂 like... Please don't.
Look I almost got shot
I've ALWAYS been a country music fan. This is right up my alley.
Is this her way of letting us know she's voting Trump2024😮?
Clipe preguiçoso é esse , a mulher gravou poucos segundos e colocou  pra rodar. 😂
I can't rest for a second, people from your fucken life is all around my neighborhood hood
Not a fan of this
Is this Beyonce tryna take over Taylor's forsaken territory? Lol
If I don't get my respect, you are not getting yours
❤❤❤❤
Look am older than Doja, everyone knows that, who the fuck is Doja messing with on record? With
Damn love country and this is a good song but ya that outfit is not country that's urban city life but in the end the music is music just got to keep this video on YouTube lmao I like it better then her other music but again NWA Johnny Cash Son House Slayer to Beethoven to Charley Pride kiss and angel good morning im all over with music
Doja cat should get off my shit
Am going to tell it to the world
She's and Kelly both are trying to make me commit sucide
Fire 🔥🔥🔥
Get off my life
Leave me alone
Or you think am not seeing everything , leave me alone
charlie pride meets tammy wynette
Cause you guys are older , you are beating me up? Cause my records are better? What? 2years older? 3years older? What's that? Are you mother ?
kinga suprema do mundo!! 🙌🏽👸🏽🇧🇷
“If Taylor Swift did Country, so can I.” -Beyoncé

Beef, am waiting for the beef, one punch line of my rap will send your husband six feet, guess Kelly is already enjoying her ☕️. You knew you where older from the beginning I got alot of respect that's why am not fucking with you.
What a shit boring video,is that the best you can do Beyonce boring!!
Her body is great. Just wished she didn't show it like this at this age. I guess lol.. do ya Thang sis
MOMMA IS COMING TO COLLECT. SHE WARNED EVERYONE. DO YOU SHIT BEY.
Leaving this comment here for all yall hardcore country music fans who had some nasty to say about Beyoncé in the past but can now put some respect on her music and talent. 💐💐💐
CARALH* , ISSO TÁ BOM DEMAISSSSS
Ummmm .. ok.. I guess
Beyonce said she gonna get them white folks acceptance one way or another lol. 😂😂😂😂😂
If she’s doing a County Album and The Queen of Country Dolly Parton is not on it. It will make no sense!!
🇧🇷🐝💛
So this means Ariana Grande is going to make a Country song in about a year?😂😂
She don’t know what she doing. 😂😂😂😂 this is not country music…and she know better
everyone talking GENRE. But music is music yall, it’s like you and me… black, Asian, Mexican, white, etc… we’re all the same. I  wish people would enjoy all genres equally cause music is fuckin great.
Let's all remember she's from TX and heard plenty of country music. Let's not forget the marketing genius she's married to either.  He's all about the $ and knows how much she can generate on that platform!
If you black from the south, you know country music. It was birth from black folks anyway. Shout out to Charlie Pride etc.
Maravilhosa,tudo na voz dele fica perfeito ao meus ouvidos.❤️❤️
Always support bey ❤
I love country. And ever since I heard daddy lessons, I’ve been wanting a country album from her. I hope she releases a country album. cause it sounds SO DAMN GOOD
Thats why then the cowboy hat at the grammys…
Its very nice to hear a vocal performer mature to this level.
Bey I love you but you’re a country signer now?? It explain the cow hat at the Grammy’s.
Support Black Country western artists!
Not even Beyonce can turn me into a country fan. Love you girl but no.
Spurs! Spurs! Boots!
Ninguém acima dela !
Black culture ❤🙏🏽👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾= country music
Yah, Bee, get into it. Let them no country music
Que dlç meu deus, aoty vem ai
... into a dragon!
When Beyoncé wins the best country album at the CMAs, the country industry will gagg 🤠🐴🤠🐴
not mad at it
Beau montage 🎉
I love it
Mulher !!!! Em qualquer estilo musical ela é maravilhosa❤🇧🇷
If you perform at the Opry I'm gonna die lol. I don't think the B word has ever been said there before
Song Rate 🤔👂🎶 7.8/10 cool
Beyonce is the greatest! Take that Swifties😂😂😂❤
My brain is confused.
When Beyoncé  makes a song bout your state ❤❤ love you!
She done made a whole lotta folks mad and THAT makes me 😊😊
She said, "yall wanted visuals? here shut up"
This is some bullshit
So encouraged that she's not using sex or objectification to sell her music.
The music is good but… the visualizer is where it’s at lol
Ice cube, ice T , 2pac in the studio MTV interview, let's start from there and watch someone broken, I need a new new job , fixing someone guess that's something new, and next coming up is Ethel Love interview. Don't forget someone loves candles.

Uh oh, B bout ta make all country female artists nervous!

Black Amber Heard is back vs Taylor Swift😢😢😢
The song becomes a big hit 2024!
That sucked. She's out of her element.
Beyonce te amo mucho❤❤ eres la mejor ❤❤😊

The way they will playing this song at the country music bars and seeing everyone dancing to it in videos is about to be epic!
PERFEITAAAAAAAAAA
I just hope the 🐝 beyhive doesnt go a..sht when she gets ignored for all the country awards!
She coming for #1 and a Grammy in every category!!!!! Mrs Carter… ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
aaaaaaaah ela arrasa demais
Boring. And girl needs a bra.
I’m leaving this comment today so after a month or a year, when someone likes it, I get reminded of this masterpiece ❤
GREAT!
This is when am discovering that country music was originated from black culture. I used to make Banjos using woods and wires with my friends.
COUNTRY ERA!!!
God I love these visuals when does this woman sleep!
❤❤❤❤
This assssss
Not too shabby! 😊 I know it'll sounds even better not listening from my phone.

Part two is for the straights i get it

Horrible outfit
I like country and this is a good song. I think the country music world will be pissed they are very exclusive but they didn't care when they took over the genre lol.

Não estava preparada pra isso
🗣#Beyoncé  is an amazing vocalist, what CAN'T SHE DO IN GENERAL?!!💗
I love her new stuff, and if country music fans don't want to listen/buy it, then eff 'em. She has enough fans to cover it

🙌🏼 YES!!!!! She can do anything!!!!
Now here’s a genius ❤
She turned country like Tay Tay 😂
❤
Reminding me of when people were saying that Taylor can never pull off a Beyoncé song but Beyoncé can pull off a Taylor Swift song. 😹Funny how she is kind of proving that with a new country song.
❤❤❤❤
Hey its Beyonce & as soon as I get back to line dancin’ I’m all in.
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🥰🥰🥰
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🥰🥰🥰
Ready to purchase a concert ticket!!!!
Did this video cost about £10 to put together? Just standing on a black floor with a black background?
Yes, girl! Get us country back❤
Beyonce - do a song with DOLLY!! Do it.
I've been in such a bad mood, but this really turned things around. I'm having a birthday in a few days and I've been feeling pretty glum, but this music has really really been cheerin me up.
U people are pathetic. She can kick a rock with a shoe and u all are in tears and proud. It’s getting ridiculous 😊

I only like The Everly Brothers so I'm curious about this I'm guessing a kind of RnB country.
Who's listening here from the Philippines?
Well I very much doubt that the governor would approve of this but hey catch us if you can. I can see him now red faced, wheeling as fast as possible. "You can't do that this here is texas" 🖕
CMA here she comes
Grammy you betta eat this up !
Queen of country
I LOVE IT!!! She’s reinventing herself, and that’s how you stand the test of time!!!
Praying for another tour!!!
Can’t do anything else but be sexual in her videos. What a shame
I love thisssssss ❤❤❤❤❤🤍👑🐝🍯🍯🍯🍯🍯🍯🍯🍯🍯 much love from FIJI 🇫🇯
Great job Beyoncé!!!!
Black people are into country all of a sudden.? Y’all been making fun of country for years. The only thing country sounding about this song is the beat. It doesn’t come off as authentic country. Maybe because I’m used to her singing hip hop and r&b.
Now she trying to be like Taylor Swift 😂😂
Beyhive 🐝🐝🐝🐝
Mamãe tá on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
teach us beyonce
Is there anything this woman can’t do???❤🐝
There are many many many black country artist… I have always loved country.
Beyonce was like I am coming for you'll genre of music. Watch me do it!!...lol..Some folks gonna be mad  about this one. But baby I am here for it. You go Beyonce.❤❤❤
This is so Joanne 💋
This is what running out of ideas sound like 😂😂😂😂😂
Perfeita em tudo que faz ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
I don’t think there’s anything that this woman cannot sing, she has just kicked the bar completely out of the playing field. She’s in a league all by herself, and she knows it. All I can say, is that high to you, Beyoncé, for going there, because country music has its roots with Black people, and it always has, and nothing can ever change. The fact, I love the fact of the matter that there is absolutely nothing that, you haven’t been able to sing that you have tried that. So this is just something all together special and just very likable.
Fire 🔥
Amazing ❤
😂😂😂😂
Gaga did country better i think. This is also ok song
🤠
I'll never understand why a voice like that feels the need to be naked in front of the world.
Not that's a bad ass❤
Uh, NO, and I live in Nashville.This sounds like a JOKE.She really wants AOTY, but this is HOT GARBAGE.🗑️
Lady Gaga collab when???????????????😢
Sounds like WIDE MOUTH MASON
Brilliant She is quietly showing them who she is and I'm here for AALLLLLL of it!!!
Jamás pensé amar el country 😍😍😍
Country music? Beyonce take the wheel!!!! 😁😁😁
There’s so many good black country artist out there guys they just not putting them on the radio!
Folks sleep on country music……..not anymore.
there better be a duet with Chris Stapleton!!!!!
It's a no for me
I think this is my favorite Beyonce song. Such a good damn song
Country soul
Her last song before her death
Always loved country from afar. Not anymore ❤️
The only reason we didn’t like country is cause they voices don’t have SOUL. Like let’s talk about all bey county music n k Michelle!!
Loving the "Born This Way Era" look 😬
Es una copia barata de Madonna
Love you ❤❤
CUNTRY BEY 🐝 is the CATEGORY ❤🔥🔥💃🏿.
I love this so much. Queen B delivered as always
Gawd Dammit I can't help but love this! This is blue grass country... I'm here for it !
Country music awards here comes Beyonce❤❤❤❤
I don't like her anymore 🤦 she's fake
Yesssss🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She's really reclaiming the black music genres and bring them back to its roots. First it was house music, now it's country. Can't wait till she redeem rock and roll next.
Beyoncé body sooo tea & so is this song .
ALBUM OF THE YEAR👑
Let's get these two songs from the Queen to the top of the Billboard hot 100!!!
Nunca percebi que Country era tão gostoso de ouvir
QUEEN BEYONCE 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Never really loved country but thisss isssss new and exciting and iconic already i know Beyoncé ALWAYS GONNA DO IT FOR ME
Okaayyyyyyyyyyyy Bey‼️‼️‼️
okay everybody sing along and follow the bouncing breasts!  keeping abreast of what's happening now in country music.
I’m from Asia and I love BEYONCÉ
Lol take over country since Taylor swift wants to be in pop music. Beat her at her own game
muer vem pro Brasil pliss 😩😭🙏🏻
I love you Beyoncé ♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is just awful
Amo muito
country for life
I've ALWAYS been a country music fan. This is right up my alley. ❤💫💥💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
This woman don’t know what to do anymore to creep her way onto album of the year. Now she’s two stepping singing country? So pathetic, her husband already blasted the academy and no one who has ever won in history needed their husbands to blast the academy. And Only #8 trending on YouTube? She can’t even place #1 on YouTube????? I can’t stop laughing. Looking like tina knowles in that cowgirl hat and they baby girl looking like Jay Z with that face.
She can’t do country or soul. She if glad and dead personality and it shows through her music. She can do the runs and mimick like a trained vocalist, but she has no soul
♥️♥️♥️
Love u so much Beyonce ❤
Next feature with jelly roll?  Luke combs??   Morgan wallen???
I think I like Country Beyonce'!
This song is more in the country spectrum with a blues vibe that’s is nice, but I don’t know if this is will be a hit 🫢
Lawd she did it again. I hope we get a tour
CUTE !!!! 💯💯
Gorgeous roots sound. The harmonies are absolutely beautiful. This is a dish best served at a backyard party on a Saturday night. And who is that picker? Great job to Queen Bey!
🖤it
WOW!!!!!!!!
I been "yee hawwing" all damn day!!!
It’s giving album of the year
Our one and only <3
Remember Daddy Lessons?
awww the singing stripper is trying out country
Absolutely have zero interest in Beyonce or her husband, zero talent but pure narcissism
Bey Joanne!?
If you watched this more than once meet me here.Yee Haw🤠
Thank you Queen...✌🏾🌺✌🏾
What a BOP 💚
Todos rendidos a country graças a Queen. Quem diria ❤
Que musica boa meu deus 😮
Ok but why do we need to see her almost half naked?
this does not sound like country music house maybe
Bucket List 2024: Learn how to line dance
I'm not a fan of country music, but Beyonce's performance is different! 😅 Oh my god, now we have to wait for March 29th! 😅
Waaaaaaahhhh. Lovin this so much already ❤️❤️❤️
True artist ❤
1 million in 16 hours that’s incredible 😭😭 QUEEN
Uh la la this is beautiful 😍
The first Beyonce song that I have liked in a long time. 😊
I wonder if Pharrell knew anything about this that’s why his Louis Vuitton line was Texas theme
Я не поклонник кантри-музыки, но в исполнение Beyonce - это другое! 😅 О, боже, теперь придется ждать 29 марта! 😅
#TexasHoldEm is a genre bending hit! #frfr
It's giving blue grass almost! 😲  I did a reaction video for 16 Carriages and Texas Hold 'Em on my channel. Would love to hear your thoughts as well 😊
Not gonna lie; in my opinion this is the music that actually fits her voice like amazingly. I’m not usually a fan of country music but I definitely am feeling this.
Texas killing it this year, I take it back please don't secede😭
Ansioso pro dia 29/03/2024
No for me, sorry bey
Daddy issues is my fav song from Beyoncé so I’m LOVING THESE SONGS I’ve been waiting for something like this
Not them trying to place them in the pop genre… they are shookkkkkk😅
Reinaaaaaa😫❤️❤️❤️❤️

do you know how many black women been trying to break into country music and beyonce just kicked the door down and took center stage?
Yaaaasssssssss
Act i : Aliens  Act ii : Cowboys The whole era was aliens vs cowboys and we didn’t even know it 😭
Mother we love you ❤🇲🇽
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH
BHAHAHAHA  so desperate
Beyoncé always gives us this sense of hope ❤
So we never got visuals for Act I but we’re getting visuals for Act II before being released  Btw: I’m in love with this song ❤️
And once again she is brilliant 👑🐝
RIP to all country artist career
She just destroyed country music
Just queen
So if Beyoncè had to write a song for a hoedown dance scene this would be the song! Just became an all time favorite of mine and the writing is 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
Perfect for gym
Her voice in these two songs are amazing
Country women dont dress like that
🤠 howdy babygirl I like it
Jeez this ain’t country music 😂
The more beautiful than ever ❤❤
Three kids where? She makes my “A game look like a Z game”
❤❤❤
Queen of all Genres!!!!
Blonde hair and country music. Lol. Whites need to go after her culture appropriation
Bey❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE THIS ❤
I like this song. She’s gonna have the country singers mad because this is good music.
This better get you that Grammy win you have deserved for decades ❤
..."Пелагея"...

I've never been into country, but i kinda like it now😢
History lesson black people started country music with BANJO instrumental African immigrants 17th century not know 1920 17th century
slay
Good old fashioned Hoedown music!
I’d be keen to hear more country from Beyonce, more experimental. I hope this isnt a beige album for awards. Either way its pleasant music 👏
I ❤
Texas Stand Upppp!!!! 🤠
Alguém contou quantas vezes ela atirou no escuro
She’s truly being herself and embracing every element and I’m here for every atom of it 🔥🔥🔥🐝🐝🐝🐝
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Inspired by Jelly Roll
I just…😭😭😭

This is our chance south side!!!
This is pure talent 🙌🏾🔥
❤❤❤❤
Perfect ❤
❤❤❤❤
Taylor has her shook. This looks straight desperate. And completely shit on usher releasing during the SB.  This is why the industry has an issue with her.
A maior❤

I can dig country.
iykyk
LMMFAO... they still not giving her album of the year.  Let's see how many CMA awards she get
This visual is everything!!
A texan woman will never dress like that. She looks like she's going to dance on a pole. We need real women representation, not trashy ones like this.
😂😂😂
god dawn how this make me rose and dance like theres no tomorrow!!
First of all i BEEN a country fan 🤭 👑 🐝
She said fuck the grammys if they’re not giving me the album of the year with pop music ill make a country album and win that tittle 😂😂😂
House/Ball is ours, rock and roll is ours, country is ours, bring them back Beyoncè!!!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Beyoncé gave us a country bop with Texas Hold’Em!
Album title: heaux down
Love this!!❤❤
It's  a no for me and I know them white country fans are pissed. You  do not have the voice for country. The nudity and cussing is too much.  You joining the old so show nudity club.
Quem gosta de rodeio bate forte com a mão 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Yup Beyoncé gonna try it in their small towns!!! 🎊 🎉
I'm here for it
Maybe if she get Nelly to help her with her country music, cause 🧑🏽‍⚖️🧑🏽‍⚖️🙅🏽‍♀️. Now Nelly will make this song hot. Nelly know how to do country. If none of u have checked out the country artists that Nelly have worked with,y’all missing some damn good music! Those songs are🔥🔥🔥
They can never make me hate you queen,everything she touches is. Banger, love ❤you Beyoncé
Some people just don't know when to give it up 🤦
nah she is boring, no personality, somebody needs to tell her she is not the Queen Elizabeth, her talent is top tier nevertheless
I’m in here getting it 🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
A rainha entrega perfeição em todos os gêneros,é muito bom ver uma mulher preta cantando um gênero de música que foi criado por nós pretos(a),mulheres/homens pretos(a)voltem a cantar country/sertanejo e vamos mostrar que foi criado por nós.💖✨✊🏽
It’s A Regular Ho-Down With Beyoncé Taking The Lead Here. All The Way From Her Home State Of Texas!!! Cowboys Are Ya Ready?💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
I LOVE THIS!  🖤🌻❤️‍🩹
Yep. This is definitely what your typical Texas Hold 'Em player looks like.
❤❤❤❤cannot wait!
Beyonce to headline CMT awards 2024. #nashville
And mamas did it again 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
I got to really check this out. I’m a 47 black woman, who love all genres of music. And I got a pretty good bit of country on many of my playlists. Music has always been my life. Had I signed long ago, I would’ve been rolling with Mary and Whitney. Now I can’t really hear Bey doing this country , but I will check it out!🤔🤔👂🏼👂🏼
CAN'T WAIT to make a Reaction to this ICONIC Momentaa😱❤️🧲❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
❤❤❤
😂I listen to hiphop only but even i am vibing to this 😭😭
Why bring wretched to Country that's not how they roll
Because she can.....And what???!🤷🏽‍♀️(neck roll)
Always been a huge country music fan; and Beyoncé doing this, amazes me! She's so versatile, as an artist!
Is anyone else hoping that she will do a part two of telephone with Lady Gaga since they’re both going through their country music career. imagine 2024. That’ll be amazing.
mother
queen
I'm sorry but she had to know how this looks when she releases "texas hold 'em" during the whole border control thing.
Yesssss B
No
Beyonce 👑☝️🪨
1 plus million views in 15hours is crazy!!!!
Beyoncé et la country : INCROYABLE 😍😍 😍 😍, alors là grande surprise, Di l'album est comme ça, il me tarde, ça changera du précédent qui ne m'a pas plu du tout pourtant j'ai tous ces albums sauf le dernier.... Vive le country et Beyoncé 🤠🤠🤠
🗑️🗑️🗑️
girl no
I like country, and Beyoncé but I don’t enjoy this. 1:34 I also hope y’all don’t start dressing like this😂
She doesn't need to dress like to get noticed. The entire world who she is. She should be known for her voice not an exposed body. She already has fame & money.
She doesn't need to dress like to get noticed. The entire world who she is. She should be known for her voice not an exposed body. She already has fame & money.
Now her and Megan really need to collaborate again two Texas hotties.
I can so see her and Jimmy Allen doing something like this!
Act I for the homo Act II for the homophobic
I suddenly love country 😅
Yeah... no. Sorry.

Country music by Queen Bey! 👸🏽🤠🐎
Ok Beyoncé we hear you. 🫶🏼🫶🏼
And the CMA goes to Beyonce Knowles-Carter!
É hora da gente calçar a nossa bota de piton, irahhhhh 🤠🤠
Love u queen ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Why does she have to be naked! Your voice is enough girl! No need for all of that. Too bad she cant see that. And she has a daughter looking up to her.
PokerStars Bientot
This is 🔥🔥🔥
Hold'em
Country, the best music genre in this world❤
Poker Poker ! Texas all Dem Mon Kiff aussi
❤❤
As of today i’m a country fan😭😩
this made lil ol country heart happy!!! 💖
I have just become a country fan🙂 This woman is LEGEND. She surprises us each time. Queen of our heart❤Queen B❣
Has anyone noticed the silver cobra on her glasses? Hmm.
I HATE country music but this is okay. Now if she doesn't release music video this it might end up flopping like her last track did. I dont see the alot of black people liking this song either and I dont see alot of white ppl liking this either cause she's playing country music now. So idk...🤷🏽‍♀️ I dont mind the song but alot of people are not open minded or wanna see alot of black artist try mainly white genre's of music even us black people started most genre's of music.
Wow!  2016 - Beyonce surprise releases formation on my 19th birthday for the Super Bowl.  2024 - Beyonce surprise releases Texas hold em AND 16 carriages on my daughter's first birthday during the Super Bowl. The Circle of Life 😂
This is one way to dethrone Taylor swift. Go for the country music album of the year and she’s gonna get the Grammy over her forsure. And honestly this sounds like a refreshed country soul than Taylor sounding the same every time
K michelle rolling round mad
I love this
Maybe at home😅
Love so much
Beyonce is an artist like it or dont ... Shes here as long as shes alive
AMORE MIO❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can’t see myself blasting this in my car! Not even for you B😢
I love u so much ❤
Get a shirt on
It’s a no for me. Every lane isn’t meant for you to drive in
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
HaHa This woman knew *exactly* when to release these!
Vem cantar essa no Brasil por favor 🇧🇷
Mmmm
Eu amei demais
the beginning reminds me of Madonna’s Don’t Tell Me, love it!
Gosh....how good she looks...And how good the song sounds...even if it's something new for her.She's a great artist. She is a queen. She's one of the best.🫠❤🔥
Real sweet song, and you look amazing ....
pile of poo.
Huge fan of country music and have been waiting on this album for months! We are ready Beyonce! Let's get the line dance and tickets for the CMA's!
I’m ready to go to a rodeo now. This 🔥
Yawn. Such a bummer when people fall off but still buy they're own hype.
Charlie Pride would be so proud!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely no!!!!!!     Omg what’s going on with celebs these days.  😢😢😢😢
I think this is her biggest mistake in her career
A pity someone, somewhere in her music management/PR thinks this track needs a soft porn video to show it off.
I like Beyonce but i think im just not into country music.
Love the song and I'm looking forward to her country album.  Just hoping it's not hypersexual.
This is so lame!!! K. MICHELLE WAS WAY BETTER!!!
Now Create a Dance to accompany this song 🎵
Pure Propaganda magic mind wash garbage  Whoever listens to this trash has brain damage.🎉
This is just terrible tbqh… It’s a primitive understanding of what country music actually is. I’m embarrassed for B. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Oh shit 😂❤❤❤❤smh 😩 dam u Beyonce i was. Just saying i dont see this!!! 😂🤦🏽‍♀️😬
I bet you all these beyonce fans are gonna jump onto her "country music" for a month and then as soon as another pop artist comes out with a song they'll switch their attention over and completely forget about country music all over again. Imagine thinking you've created country music just because you followed the stereotypical road maps yet lack any experience living in the countryside or getting together with neighbors to play blue grass and fiddle
It's solid ❤
Cultural appropriation
I love the move Queen;) I can’t wait to see all your country collabs explode!!! 💥 I’m shaking in my boots
Already obsessed ❤
I like this but I’m hoping the whole album won’t be country
Are we just biased cause it’s ms. Bee cause all of the sudden I’m ready for a a hat and some boots
big beyonce masterpiece
not a beyonce fan but this is nice! i don’t understand the flack.
💃
1m
❤
Glad i appreciated Country Music since i was a kid now that i'm an adult it totally paid off 🎉
i feel like a single mom with 2 kids on the side of the liquor store at 11:45 PM after kicking my cheating husband out of the house while chugging a beer with my 5 year your old next to me and my 6 month old in my arms.
Love the Lumineers influence - reminds me of that Hey Ho song! ❤🎉
What's with artists going country all of a sudden❔❓ Austin Mahone just put out country music not long ago as well❕❗
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
💨Pew pew❤
Thank you for repping the true black southern bells…❤❤❤take our shit back❤❤❤❤
She looks good as white girl.
How many country bars she's been in how many card games has she played with out having a million in the bank.
Heard the two and thought they both were really good
Beyonce gonna slay any genre she touches... I don't even like country, but you'll find me at the local hoedown soon!
I have to chuckle at these two new songs and visuals. She’s like listen… I gave y’all act ONE.. in this second act y’all are going to be happy just looking at me on repeat and just listen to me sing! That’s it, that’s all!! 🐝
I really like this song
This song is ok. Obviously not something that I'd let loop on repeat, but while I'm here, it's ok. I'm curious to watch the interviews that she'll do on all of the white platforms explaining her inspiration for entertaining the country music marketplace. A couple of her contemporaries done stated that they're entertaining country music. R&B/Hip-Hop is dead so country music is where artists are flocking to. Afrobeats done got watered down so that's out of the question.
Lady Gaga is actually the Goddess of Music & Art Culture. Thanks Bey for knowing this to the world through your act i & act ii. I’m truly in love & got so much respect for this now.
I'm sorry but this isn't country! Try again!
Thats why she was dressed like that at the Grammys
I actually like it ❤
What’s with covering one eye with a snake serpent !?! 🧐🤔🤫 Satanic Cult Illuminati much !?! Don’t be deceived! Open your eyes & mind to what is presented before you wake up! JUST REMEMBER JESUS CHRIST IS KING PRAISE HIS NAME AMEN‼️🙌🙌✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️
Oi nega! Deixa eu te falar... Vai fazer feat com a Ana Castella em Barretos ou vai participar da Fazenda?
I like this one!
The queen of radio 😂❤
🤠🤠🤠🤠
I REALLY want her to collaborate with Tanner Adell on this album. Ahh, that would be so epic.
Goat music !
Okay..this is a great song!
I don’t know about Texas, but I’d hold ‘em.
te amooooo ❤
She knows the effects of time 😜
💃🏻💃🏻❤
Yeeeehaw let’s go 3.29!!!
A era Country chegou!!!!
A bop
tits and tits, how creative video..
I think the visualizer of this song is most likely gonna be her album cover for Act 2 🔥
You got the dance ready Bey???
This ain't it 💀
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Watch her finally win album of year with a country album 😂😂😂😂
WHERE IS THAT GIRL ON TIKTOK THAT SAID THAT BEYONCES NEW MUSIC WILL BE COUNTRY CAUSE SHE WAS WEARING A COWBOY HAT AT THE GRAMMYS
Ate
Dolly Parton you are not
Era tudo que eu queria um álbum country,  eu q amo daddy L. Minha preferida
Copying Kylie Minogue's country Album / CD.....
Gone head Beyoncé get that country Grammy award ❤
Lol she can’t beat Taylor so she will try to fill  in her footsteps
Hello country music , this is my first country song I love ❤️ queen Bee can do everything ❤
BORING.......
This is my jam !
Not a fan of country but I’m here for country Beyoncé yeehaw 🤠
Here before one mili!! This is 🔥🔥🔥!!!
❤❤❤
Welp let me purchase my first pair of cowgirl boots 👢because Chile we whisky 🥃 drinking and line dancing all 2024  💃🏾 😅
pelo amor de deus grava uma música com o Chris Stapleton nunca te pedi nada
No political manipulation?
16 Carriages is whacked out bad and a poor attempt to traverse country music from R&B but this song follows the horse bangs of Daddy Lessons. This one's a good country, been a country fan since 2008. This song has something that 16 Carriages lack, the confidence, the successful attempt, though both are lyrically good. It doesn't have the casual (yet effective) narrative style of the state-of-the-art country songs but it still works. Not as good as those recently released by Zach Bryan, or Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves, or Speak Now by Taylor Swift, or even the first four albums of Chris Stapleton or Dolly Parton's and Shania Twain's music but it still works, and is working effectively.  Edited: I feel like it sounds like Jolene by Dolly Parton and some of the early 80's country mixed with Daddy Lessons
Beyonce is gonna turn out Nashville in 2024, I see.
Here before 1M 😊
Well this is terrible lol. I have no idea why pop stars think they can just “go” country lol. Between J at the Grammys and now this…big oooof
Okay contemporary country ..let's hope it tops the chart
legend icon
AI BEYONCE EU TE AMO TANTO MIA FIA, JÁ TO PRONTA PRA BOTAR MINHA BOTINHA E IR PRA BARRETONCÉ
Give us visuals for this one!!!!!
Now THIS is a vibe and a bounce! 😊
She's showing so many different looks and versions of herself in Renaissance. She can be any genre.
Jesus loves you. only jesus can save.
Okay CMA's 🤠❤️
irraaaa 🤠🤠🤠🤠
Rhiannon Giddens is such a fucking legend!
Horrible, stick to what you know best… and it’s not country. Maybe needs a steel guitar…. Lol
HEEEEEEEEEEE HAWOOOOO  THE PUDDING IS IN THE POT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
please please tell me there will be a dolly patton collabo🤞
This explains the Grammy outfit 😁
I should've known Bey was fixing to drop a country album, when I saw her wearing the cowboy hats. One thing about it. She gone always give you a hint, when she's about to do something different. Go Bey!
Jay z I see what you did smart man , we can dominate any genre we are Egyptian gods black culture will be on top
No. Just no.
Meh...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤COME ON NOW B.. Thank you very much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Horrible, stick to what you know best… and it’s not country. Maybe needs a steel guitar…. Lol
This is terrible
wow i'd be so proud of myself doing this while having children........... hahahahaha WTF is wrong with people ???
Is this her way of competing with Taylor to make sure she wins that album grammy next year? 🤣🤣 I guess she say "ok! America wants country... ima give you country"! 💀💀💀💀💀 This sound a mess.. i couldnt even finish the song... i was fast forwarding and everything... wth🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Horrible, stick to what you know best… and it’s not country. Maybe needs a steel guitar…. Lol
Visual so raw clearly shots are fired... Let's go Bey... I  just luv how every1 believe that this is just a country song...SHE SAID  this in the best QUEEN BEY  answer to the shade Nicki threw...this ain't Texas  ain't no Holdem Throw ur Cards down...... LISTEN TO THE SONG PPL😮
Love it  fun coming
I Can Feel the Grammy for Best Country Album next 2025 And probably best Vocal Album
It's a no for me.
Heeeeehoooooo 😂 sorry I could hear it
after reinasance she can do whatever she wants
This heffa getting ready to takeover every genre of music. I hope she does this album like she did Black Is King and get the artist already doing it some more shine. There’s a lot of black people making great country music
I love it
Where's the closed captioning for this music video for Deaf and Hard of Hearing fans? Please add it and thank you. #CAPTIONTHIS
Playing it on repeat until it get to a milli 😊❤🤞🏾💪🏾
Queen 👸
she has no self respect ? wow this is bad...
Epic. I'm a huge Beyonce fan but also always loved folk and country rock  music. One of my favorite bands of all time: Mumford & Sons... Now I just released my first song last year in this vibe. I thank Queen Bey for making it popular again to create country music.
*Daddy Lessons* changed how I felt about the country genre. And this album run she’s been on since self titled is fucking insane. Beyoncé is the greatest artist of my lifetime.
❤
Not me hoping she does a duet with Darius Rucker #Blackcountry
why p*rn ? i never liked beyoncé but now even less.
RAMMM TCHUUUUUU
Get that Grammy Beyonce 🎉🎉🎉. Now what they excuse gone be.
TAYLOR PUNANI SWIFT YOU INSPIRING THE GYALS .
Maravilhosa

I hope K Michelle is ok…. She’s been country singing for a while now.. Maybe a Collaboration will work???
🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🤠🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🤠🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🐝🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠🤠🐝🤠🐝🤠👸🏽

This is what I love about Queen B, she's gonna do her thing. I'm starting to like country music again 🐝🐝🐝.
After Tracy Chapman’s historic win, this is perfection. I can’t wait to play this album until my ears fall off
I love this so much🥰 Texas stand up!🔥🤘🏾
If you have never saw her perform in concert... what are you waiting for? Her live performances are a force to be reckoned with.
She's about to prove a point. Won't say a word, but her music, trends, wnd them numbers about to speak for her!
❤❤
vulgar
why do poeole doesn’t like country ?? beyonce will show you how good it is
What the hell is this trash. Bey this is not it. I have always enjoyed different genres music country being one of those genres being country music and  she should have left this one to K. Michelle.
Always loved all genres of music and of I love Beyonce 🔥🔥🔥
🎉
reinaaa

26 million in 14 hrs ❤
lmao no!stop it! trying to stay relevant.
Queen B i love it
This song is amazing.  Beautiful as Beyonce is though, this visualizer is lame.
Waiting to see the TIK-TOK line dancing TAKEOVER. 👀👀👀🧐🧐🧐🔥🔥🔥
This is the same as a white kid from the suburbs making trap music, This shit ain't authentic, Beyonce ain't going to no damn dive bar 😂
Can’t get it out my head! Love it ❤
S/O to K Michelle for inspiring
I need y'all to understand the BRILLIANCE of Beyoncé airing a commercial last night during the Super Bowl where she tries to "break Verizon" by dropping new music and...then she actually dropped new music the same night😭
🐝  🤠
🤩😍😘 I love it B, I just wrote a country song when I was in Daytona.  Great minds think alike... #theColective #universalConscious aye man I Love Y'all & Be Blessed 😊
I really like this Song her Voice really suits country music!
We gon be drinking beer with our daisy dukes and cowboy boots in stadiums next I love it
❤❤❤
This woman sexual energy is insane
Came for RHIANNON GIDDENS💙💚this is gold
Poor wardrobe choice...
wasn't expecting it but I love it 😍😍our Queen keeps Queenin'💃💃💃💃
Not country. Not hating. There's not exciting about it either. It's southern pop at most with a soul r and b vocal that has notes of country instruments.
QUEREMOS COLABORACIÓN CON LADY GAGA DE NUEVO 😭😭😭
She coming for album of the year #IDeclareWar
This lady is just busy n amazing.
Terrible. Single cover is trash
Nice song, but no basements here
what a loop
THIS ACTUALLY SO GOOD! This woman keeps topping herself wow
Perfeita ♥️🇧🇷🫶
She is a genius!  She’s gonna have black folks singing country music now.  No more rnb
Ever since she did daddy lessons, i been wanting her to release a country album. IM SO EXCITED
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH MAMA
Its not poppin.....it may have to grow on me
I am country and I'm from Texas this is not country, this video is ridiculous, but i guess anyone that puts on a cowboy hat and wears boots is country!!  Get the hell outta here! 💯 And I'm not a hater but I'm not a follower!!  🤦🏼‍♀️✌🏼🤠
Vou morar na fazenda só pra ouvir esse album todos os dias ao amanhecer.
Boring song…can’t see what it’s offering apart from the fact Beyoncé winning a country award or Grammy just to say she did did it that too.
Congratulations! This present, was always your future and it has been waiting for you! Soo happy for you love
i’ve always loved country. and i genuinely feel like if country wasn’t overtaken by a certain demographic more people would be a fan of the genre. this genre is OURS y’all. remember that
Six months from now: “You are the visualizer, baby” 😂
A dona do mundo. <3
this is cringe
Perfeitaaaaaaaa
I have loved you beyonce since i was a little girl. Love from zambia
I love diversity in an artist voice. Besides her Kelly Clarkson is on of the few artists who could pull that off.❤

cara, eu te amo tanto
Nice banjo groove.
This sucks.  She’s just jumping on the bandwagon since Country is the most popular music in America.
I like it!!!
I don’t like it
Country girl perfect voice and tone ....back to beyonce best
Love it!!!!❤
The outfit is weird as fuck , it’s all cringe. Dang bey
Beyonce + K. Michelle country song would be interesting
Uhhh this is sooo good 😍🤠🙌🏾 BEY- Hawwwww 🎉
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤L. O. V. E.
Flop
Always proud to be her fan 🎉🎉🎉
Holy shit I'm gay
Queen 👑🔥
lol  them yts is pissed. K Michelle now Bey coming to the CMTs. 😂😂😂
Yuck. 🤮 she aint no country singer
I love it❤😊
I just can’t stop listening to this song
Everyone wants to be country now.😂😂 She hasn’t been good in years and this is no better. It just keeps getting worse.
I’m so Honor that she dropped it on the birthday🎉
Can she get any more beautiful?
This sucks. And not country.
the best is beyonce🔥
No.
It's giving country swing . I like it.❤
I like this much better than the other type of music Beyoncé.
She has perfect voice for country music.
O feat com Ana Castela vem 👩‍🌾👩🏾‍🌾🐝🐝
Welp and done it again
SCREAMING!!!!! This woman is so brilliant. Her art is a bold & necessary statement of reclamation of ALL music that has roots in Black culture. I'm so here for this brilliant use of talent and a massive platform.
Wasn’t even paying attention then noticed my foot was tapping. 🤔 that’s weird
❤❤🔥👢🤠
Such a jam. Starting with those sweet banjo lines from Rhiannon Giddens- so good!
Terrible!
Honestly I love country music but idk what this is.... but good 👍 luck with it
No thanks
AMAMOS BEYONCÉ🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹🇧🇷🇧🇷💗💗
❤❤❤
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Essa música tá PERFEITA igual VOCÊ
Beyoncé is about to take over every genre of music
EU TE AMO BEYONCÉ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
❤❤❤❤❤
OBRIGADO POR FAZER MEU DIA❤❤❤
AMEI
LINDA
Meh
Very simple to understand. THANK YOU.
Finally Bey shows herself more as an artist again. I really like the expression in her voice and the vibe of the two new songs. I didn't like the last album that much. The two new songs promise to be more sophisticated.  I'm very excited to hear new music from her.❤🎉
Sonically, this is gorgeous--I can't wait for more ❤❤
MAMÃE VOCÊ ARRASOU TANTO!!!!
Not country, but good rhythm, and maybe just what the charts need right now. I like it.
Beyonce looks white now. Totally european
My mom
I just found out that even country music is from the black people. I really thought it's not from them as most of the singer i heard is from the white people. Anyway thanks to our African friends bringing all types of genre that influenced all over the world from pop, gospel, blues, rnb,soul,electro,disco,jazz and even the rock and roll.. thank you my friends
Beyonce the untouchable period she just took it to a whole different level. This hits real nice❤❤❤❤
👀❤️❤️💋
Is this country or CUNTRY?
ok Beyonce can we get a Chris Stapleton duet song!!
Get them Beyonce! Howdee!!!
As someone who grew up on country. This is bad
Delicia
Rainha ❤
🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰 BEY!!!
F@K YEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!   AMAZING!!
I am hungarian, but I always felt I have an american side,maybe one of my earlier life! How I love this! And Bey too! Masterpiece music!❤👌🏻
Queen Beyonce ❤❤❤ What can't you do?
Una mierda de albun   Beyonce lleva haciendo discos y canciones que son una porqueria. Canta canciones con baja energia. Todo karma a cambio de material tiene su precio. Que jesus cristo te encamine amen
Now I wanna ride a horse!
yaaaaassssaaa!!!!! I love it!!!
Versátil e artista completa! Diva!
This is terrible. Stick to what you know
I'm a 3rd ward September 4th born  Houstonian so anything Bey does is the one. Good Beyy🎉!!!!
I grew up a country fan, but became so alienated over the past 10 years or so. Now I remember what I loved about it.
Its str8
870k 13 hours in
Hell yeah Beyonce you are so talented. Love this. ❤
She needs to sell music and be relevant.Country music now! Next is opera 😂😂😂
Nooooooooo this is not country at all
Lovely music, but why eoes she needs to be naked? It is country music, she cen put clouts on. And this explain wht J Z did at rewards for publicity.
A era country da queen ❤
This isn’t country 😂
when she said country she meant IT
Okay...now I'm more of a fan. ❤
Beyonce made me to start loving Country gender. Queen Things!
I like this one ❤
Some of us see this and it is quickly confirmed…she is not the same person who entered the industry. Her allegiance is one that if many really knew, would remove not just themselves, but everyone they knew FAR from any and all she touches.   And that is a very sad situation.  I hope it is all worth it, “Bey.”
She sounds awesome as a country singer. I just can't see anyone dressed the way she is on a  music stage full of country music singers
I love Beyonce’s husky alto voice and the cleverly-written variety in melody and sounds of this song remind me of her most creative work, “Black Parade.”  But as a country-western song, I have the same gripe I had with “Daddy Lessons,” which I love, but both sound clumsily studio-mixed.  In both, the backup singers don’t sound live and authentic, their voices sound exactly the same each time they chime in, just inserted in the mix like mile markers.  The whistling sounds studio mixed, too.  If you’re aiming for gritty and down-to-earth, which is what country-western is about, gather some real live backup singers to sing with you and make it real.  (As for the video, ouch, the less said the better!)
Phew this feels personal, only B can pull this off and make it look easy. I love this era!
I was excited for K. Michelle's country album. But Beyonce is another level ❤❤❤  Go ladies!!  🤠 👢
This is for us “Daddy lessons girls” ❤
❤
K. Michelle and other black artists have done country. My thing about Bey is that she comes late to the game, and people act like she is doing something new.
Been waiting for a Beyonce country album since Daddy Lessons!
Eita que do nadaaaaa 🇧🇷
Wow multi talented
I make those Vests if anyone is interested
This song is so pleasing to the ear❤❤❤😊
Not my fav but she trying
Time to show us my ass because my music is shit...
Come ON And REP TEXAS Then BEYYYYY‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 YASSSSS
Beyoncé, u r a diva, time to act like that and not selling ur high quality music by "s3x sells"
I’ve been waiting on this since daddy don’t shoot!! H-Town girl all the way!!🤠🤠🤠🥰🥰🥰
Uma pegada de Daddy lessions
Yassss bringing country back to the people who created it 🥰🤗
Every R&B singer is now a country singer...
Very só good bey luv u

Beehive 2024
Omg álbum country vem aí ❤❤❤❤❤ Te amoooo mãe
Country fan I am. Love this Beyonce your team is a genius for this one.❤❤❤❤❤❤
music to play GTA5/6 :)
Amazing, Love this!
Hot garbage
Go on, Bey 🎉 🩷❤️🩵
I love that she was dropping hints all this time When she was showing up wearing cowboy hats to different places
Why isn't it enough in America to be a good musician...why aren't women prouder? Why do you think you can't win without nudity? Does your son or granddaughter want to see you like this?
SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!
This is really good. Better than the stuff called Country.
I am in tears . I love Beyoncé . I am a huge country fan . And I love that she’s finally giving her artistry to country music. There’s so many black & brown people who love country and so many artist of color in country who are going to love this .  This is amazing 🥰 CMT get ready !
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like this. It's a different vibe. I can see a line dance to this!
Beyonce ❤❤
Beyonce is that woman. 🤠
Country is black! So yes Beyonce is legitimate to sing Country! Go BEY🫡♥️
Pqp que mulher
I can't wait bee and country music .....I love it❤❤❤
MY QUEEN!! YOU ARE INCREDIBLE
Love this
This girl turned me from fan to a whole air conditioner
*"Didn't like country on 07/11 but* *on 7/12 I'm a country and* *western fan!"* Beyoncé fans
I think I am gonna love this era, Can’t wait for album too.❤️☺️
She did it again.
She too fine
❤❤
Bey ain't playing 😮❤
🤠
Okay Taylor come thru
I knew she was going country! Yes let’s take it to the floor now Queen! ❤
I'm not usually a Beyonce fan, but this one is really nice. Ok, I'm a fan now.
Sucks,  and I'm a country music fan.  She's trying to hard to keep up with Taylor.  Now her and jay z and no longer the power couple they were.  It's a Taylor and Travis show now. They suck also
I teach banjo for a living, and I can't possibly emphasize how excited I am for this release.  I'm hoping it will come with some beautiful consequences.
I love me some country song
Wow! Way to go Beyonce!
Love it ❤🎉 go Queen
Where is your visualizer at the old song "Break my soul" 😢😢😢.Your fans need it immediately 😅
OMG so Perfect ❤
ahazzou, kirida
Always been a country fan, love her vocals on this one!
Love it
This is not what I call country music there's no fiddle, no banjo, no mandolin, and no steel guitar at best it's borderline pop country sorry Beyoncé
Absolute queen 👑🐝
I'm a metal head, through and through...but I'll be DAMNED if I said I didn't love this song. Catchy, and production is superb
At this point you a billionaire and your great great grandchildren all ready rich that’s a lot of brown children on your Forbes list 😂so sit tf down please I love you but baby do like riri
US Texas girls loves Country music.
https://youtube.com/@gamingchannelNoob?si=87tFO8EBketWs0a_🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This sounds like pop  this is B101 music. All you hear is a banjo. That does not make this country. This is NOT COUNTRY. Go listen TO REAL COUNTRY MUSIC.
A ERA COUNTRY CHEGOU
Watching the fabric move on her chest is more suspenseful than any modern horror movie.
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
Oh Lord, The Country Community may like it!!!
This is what it looks like when your image and voice is being used without your presence. Still waiting for a live interview
I love this one too
Rainha de Barretos
Not country at all. Garbage
I wish Beyonce, Chapel Hill, and K Michelle did a country song together :)
🤠🤠🤠🤠🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
The Michael Jackson of our generation
There is a trail ride club somewhere creating a line dance for this!  Great song!

Awful
Beylica compaaaaaaaaa
Didn’t know I could throw my ass in a circle to country music until this 🫡🤠❤
I'm from Texas... Cool song. The video has no imagination to it. Fan of the song not the video. I'm not a country music but this one is doable.
Deus eu não consigo parar de ouvir rs
Phenomenal!!!
she's going for that best country album grammy win
Only bey could get me to pay attention to anything country hahah
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love country. I love Beyoncé. I’m bout to damn die.
It's country baby❤
Welcome home, Beyonce 👏🏽 I missed this sound.. I hope Act III gives Foxy Cleopatra Work It Out vibes ❤
She did that again 😭
So many red hats gonna be confused by this.
now maybe I pay her attention 🫢
Pfiouuuuuuuuu pfiopuuuuuuu
Love it!!! Let's go Bey!!!
I had some very sad dreams and Beyoncé just changed my whole mood 😂🙌😀😀😀😀♥️♥️♥️
As a country music listener. This is an absolute tragedy and an abomination to country music and country artists everywhere!!!!  And put some damn clothes on!! A dishonorable role model for her own daughter. Don't bring that rachet shit over to country music!! They actually wear clothes and present themselves classy!! I used to listen to r&b and rap until it got too degrading for women. If you like being degraded and allowing men and women to degrade you through music by all means, like what you like. Women r&b/ rappers are a disgrace bc they are the ones leading and accepting being used as sex subjects in entertainment/music form. Say what you want, it is what it is, our young girls are using trash as role models!! I don't want that for my little girl and neither should you if you're a good parent.  This sounds terrible, be real!! Don't just like it bc it's Beyonce. Seriously it sounds horrific!!! DON'T BE A SHEEPLE!!!  This is my opinion. I have a right to my opinion. I will report to YouTube for any harassment.
Beyonce"s in her country era ? 😭😳🤠
Ohh mother B
Sis tawww🎉❤😘😆〽️👑🎭
In the Music industry you are a living" jack of all trades".  Keep on Trucking.  I love your Passion.  Nothing seem to hold you down.  You lift yourself Higher and Higher.  Love your Song......❤❤❤
And now I’m a Country fan 🤠
All right where’s the line dance , I need it stat , chop chop 👏🏽👏🏽😅
Look Bey, I’m still trying to bounce back from the Renaissance tour. Now, I have to go get me a cowgirl hat and bootssss. Stay out my pockets lol Can’t wait for the dance.
went from yas to y'all in a second
passadx
🙄🤭😴😴😴😴😴😴
❤
Yasss 🤠
Beautiful❤
The massive smile remained on my face this entire song!!!!! Whooohoooo❤
Beyonce your 6 days late but I accept this birthday present
o téléphone parte dois sendo um country Giselle e Joane
Good audio, music. Shite visual, video: inane
Wow...I needed this Queen Bey, thank you ❤. Hopefully with this album, more people will embrace Country music, primarily Black people. I grew up on country music & so I couldn't imagine my playlist without it. #Southerngirls #Southernguys #Everyregion
MISS BEYONCE NEVER DISAPPOINTS
Beyonce always slays, even at her age, while people in my country when they 28 years old they have back pain and stuff💀 But this women right here, can show us everything we want to see or hear
Ok Bey❤❤❤❤
Am I sensing a Adrienne Lenker collab?
i freaking looove love daddy lessons. can't wait to get something more like it. i guess i love country music now.
Pronto para por minha fivela de prata e cavalga por ai bey
Glad I got my cowgirl boots and know how to line dance
We got you B! We're here and ready for country music. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 on repeat
Very pleasant to the ears. Like this song very much!🤗
That double sided tape is working hard baby 😂😂
I don’t think they gone give her album of the year even with the bleached skin, lipo & country tunes.
Different for my Bey, but I like it!❤
Go back to pop music
Baphomet smh
I get this is country music, but it is just music to me. She sounds so good on this, but she always had the voice for this. It's just good music.
such a sudden twist Genre
❤❤❤
Yeah, not country, but not horrible.
Album of the year 2024,grammy better don't play we watching ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤QUEEN of music 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝

Great, now she sucks in 3 genres of music.
Já estou ansiosa para esse álbum 🎉 🥰
Just ordered my boots and spurs..
Wow. Beyonce you're awesome with your craft. Love it. That how we need work on goals and businesses.  Keep reinventing and exploring.
Curious whether/how this will land
Yes, we going country this year. Come on Queen 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
Just horrible
And Ladies and Gentlemen that's how the Country Rap genre was born thanks to Beyonce
Need a Dolly and Bey Colab 😂😂😂
I hate country unless Johnny Cash counts. Hope she don't screw this up. Lol
Yes body ❤
Why I am crying bruhh? Healing.. that's what her voice is.

Fantastic 🎉❤
eu apenas uma jovem sertaneja fã de Beyoncé 🤠💅🏼
How dyall fix the dark glitch? Once i did a music video for my friend and it was very sad i could not keep the sepia dark tones background because it would keep glitchy on YouTube
This makes want to throw back some whiskey 🥃 & pickle backs!
Cada artista tem sua era Country e Bey chegou na sua!
I'm hoping for a feature with Dolly
im sorry this is cold diarrhea on burnt Indian hair.. so bad.
Doo doo caca stool
Smmmmmart
I am calling it now, she takes it all for this album!!!
❤❤❤❤❤ this will be raking awards !!!!!!
751473 views 🎉
this woman never cease to amaze me
This woman is in another galaxy, she sings excellently in any genre, I hope she comes to Monterrey, Mexico soon!
I'll never forget this day
Go head on B 🤘🏽😎🫡💪🏽❤️
Ok Beyoncé!!! This will definitely be replaying at all times!!! Im still repeating and replaying renaissance and won’t stop!!!Yall check out k Michelle latest country album it’s 🔥 asf ❤
Knew this was going to happen after Daddy Lessons, she kills this genre as well!
OMG 😳 WHAT A DRESS
2024 yes 👏🏾
I'm a Chi-town girl and sure, there have been some country songs that cross over from time to time.  The 16 Carriages song makes me think of a funeral procession carrying her pain and challenges, but at the end there should have been a flight where she is taking off victoriously and leaving it in the past. Still felt like she was carrying it.  I got enough of my own pains to carry. Sure acknowledge the struggles but where is the redemption?  Big question per Berry Gordy $1.00 would you buy the song or a sandwich?
No sorry Beyoncé this shit sucks what are you doing
I didn't think I would like this at all, but who am I kidding...Bey is the Queen for a reason.
1:07 We’ve been ready!! Teach Beyoncé line dancing in gym class..no more square dancing Bey Dancing
🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾♥️♥️♥️
I like it..
Queenn❤❤❤
She had us fooled thinking we were getting a full blown music video when it first started!
what an icon
A era country veio 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Preparem seus chapéus 🤠🤠
Never saw myself as a country fan, especially because its not the kind of music we listen to here in South Africa but she has converted me ❤

Yass Queen!
Who the  fuck told her this was a good idea? This is the end of Beyonce and she deserves it to be. Sounds like absolute trash. So disappointed.
Definitely not my thing but good for Beyonce for trying something different.
❤❤❤❤
คันทรี่ๆ คาวเกิร์ล 👍🤠
I like it bey
So proud of our country gurl❤
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
❤❤❤
Beyonce takes country to another level 💛
❤
Can we preemptively begin the get Beyonce her AOTY Grammy campaign already?  Find Harry and Adele and make sure they are kept busy for a couple years. Just throw some pearls at Harry and tell Adele it'll be better if she waits a while and releases 40 as it's nice round number.  We need to do something about Taylor because Mama never fumbles.  Can Scooter Braun piss her off again and distract her? (and all of this is humor ... I am a fan of everyone I mentioned).
Wow those juggs are so juicy
aight bey, you pulling me to country fr and i am loving it 🫶
She told that there will be trilogy in lemonade
K Michelle ain't gonna let this slide!! 😂😂😂 You know she was trying to do the country thing a few yrs back.
I been a country fan so cmon bey welcome !
I love you - Queen B 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I need the dance routine ASAP
Take what is yours! Make history back again.
😮
Let me find out Bey got a song with Dolly Parton on it!!!!🤯
huckleberry ass beat.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ absolutely love this so damn good Love dis Bey Thank yall Texan Queen xxxx
Self glorification in ever video, don’t you get tired of yourself ? How about glorifying the Creator or maybe you forgot all about that
Wow
Beyonce has a country album, Gaga has a country album... Now can u do country duet, Telephone follow up... Remember they ran away to desert... Can be a good start for MV.
Anyone who loves mother bey likes this comment!❤🇧🇷
Act II vem aí mores 🦦🤍🍷
For those of you wondering she’s throwing up a satanic symbol with her fingers. This is a ritual.
Hell naw😂😂😂
Quem ama a mãe bey curte esse comentário!🇧🇷
Its crazy that majority of bp live in the south and not one country banger. We created country music and was somehow left out of our own creation. I grew up on country music and glad Beyonce about to introduce new fans to this genre. LETS GO!!!!
Omg❤
This one isn't for me.... not even Beyonce can make me like country lol
First song i like from her
Tava acompanhando tudo pelo insta dela❤❤❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤mãe bey arrasa🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷😊
Hope the CMAs are ready to be mad as hell again!!!!!
Beyonce is doing Second Album Coming out already ! I wonder what Act 3 genre is going to be?
Wow what a shame. A pop star doing a country inspired album. Sorry Bey its already been done by Kylie Minogue, and she did it much better sorry to say. It’s kind of pathetic that some ‘’singers’’ feel the need to copy whats already been done by someone else. It’s also a shame that Beyonce thinks she needs to look like a total slut with her titty ka ka’s out in order to make people notice her old ass now.
❤❤❤❤
And Bey does it again. Representing Texas......Waco Texas made. I LOVE IT!!!
❤🎉
Absolutely garbage song..... Overrated B
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Rhiannon Giddens on banjo!
Someone make up a line dance...❤
There is nothing Beyoncé  cannot sing! I have been blasting this non-stop. I love it !!
Is anybody else going to go buy cowboy hats cowgirl hats cowboy boots cowgirl boots??
It’s ok 🤷🏾‍♀️
Bitch period! AND ILL BE DAMNED IF I CAN NOT DANCE WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’ll be DAMNED IF I SEE ANOTHER CHICK in HIS ARMS “
This comment was not placed within 2 minutes of the post but I knew of it's  existence 2 minutes after you posted and that's only because I was listening to the non-visualizers
I can't stand u mtfs just followers smh yall don't like country music u like Beyonce there's a difference
Damn, she sounds good ❤
Absolutely not! Please retire.
Her chest out is embarrassing.
🥰
Here comes a new line dance 💃 ✨️ 🎶
It’s good she’s going back to her home roots
Daddy's lessons prepared me for this
This is brilliant!!
The modern banjo derives from instruments that have been recorded to be in use in North America and the Caribbean since the 17th century by enslaved people taken from West and Central Africa. Their African-style instruments were crafted from split gourds with animal skins stretched across them. Strings, from gut or vegetable fibers, were attached to a wooden neck. Written references to the banjo in North America and the Caribbean appear in the 17th and 18th centuries. Happy Black History Month!
Only Beyonce could make me like country music lmao
No European will listen to this xD
Me trying to line dance all of 2024 🎉 I’m here for it!
Eu tô amandoooooooooo❤😍🤠
"They" will still find a problem not to give Bey her awards for this next act smh

Amei o penteado Amy winehouse
Amazing that she claimed to be Christian yet everything she covers and does shows otherwise...her kids have to deal with the fact that she is half naked in front of everyone singing about riding surf boards and fucking
Hit 🎉
This song is amazing
I was waiting for this one
Obsessed!!!!
Miss Dolly Carter BeeHah 🐝🐝🐝🐝🔥🔥🔥🔥

Nós agrogirls e agroboys...
I’m sorry but country is the worst genre…
Love it Bey it ain’t nothing you can’t do!
I just switched genre to country music ❤❤❤❤❤
Oh sis you ate this the f*** up!!!🔥🥹
So glad she’s finally making a country album! Us Texas and Carolina girls LOOOOOOOOVE country music! 💐👑🫶🏾
Anybody who could possibly hate on Bey says more about you than it does her. 💜
This is NOT country music 😭
instrumental is giving intro song to a disney show
💛💛💛
Just terrible! She is practically naked!
Já quero um show em barretos kkk
Yes yes yea yes and yes❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
I wonder who would play Beyoncé in a bio pic
❤
Yessss B ❤❤❤❤❤
I need some zydeco from her too
IT ALREADY DROPPED?
I would like a bit more effort on the video. The song's ok.
GRAMMY!!
This is not country, good song though… but again this isnt country
BEYONCE??? COUNTRY MUSIC??? I'M HERE FOR IT!!!
AMEI. AMEI. ❤❤❤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It’s a no from me dawg
FOMOS NÓS QUE PEDIMOS SIM, PUTA QUE PARIUUUUUU
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Garbage
Serve Muva❤❤❤❤. We are your table👊🏼
I'm not really fan of Country music , but Beyonce OH MY GASH
beyonce has the perfect vocals for country music!
👑
♥️
👑🐝🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💛
Yas baby 🔥
Next year beyonce, release a GOSPEL Album! Dominate all genre of music! QUEEN OF ALL GENRE, AMEN!
I love this song!!!❤
I heard it first on a country radio this morning and I was in shock country let it on! ❤❤❤
😍❤️
Beyonce nobody does anything better than you girl
I wonder if she and K. Michelle might collab... that would be awesome
K Michelle gone have a field day with this😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤
Y’all forgot she’s a Houston  Girl. It tracks ❤
Now we’ll be wearing silver overalls, got it. Let me pull my Renaissance hat back out!
Zzzz
❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
song of the year
You can’t just call it country and suddenly it’s country.   This is pop. From the beat to the time signature and back again. Vocals are mid and lyrics are meaningless. Probably 38 writers and 59 producers on this like all the rest of Beyoncé’s trash.
PERFECT ❤
Oh God! Thank you very much for this. I love Daddy Lessons and Dolly Parton. I hope you cover Jolene but of course, it won't happen.  There are rumors about covering Jolene. I just hope!
Well this explains the cowgirl look at the Grammys. I don't like it at all B. I'm sorry but it's too far a reach. I know you want to be original and do something surprising. The music has to be good. I'm actually shook by this. I can't wait to get to the comments to see what everyone has to say. I always comment first because I don't want to be influenced by the opinions of others. She looks great but she just came off tour so that's to be expected. I loathe this music
Reinando absoluta em seu trono intocável
Bey is fabulous ❤
THERE'S NOTHING THIS QUEEN CAN'T DO..... BEYOND THANKFUL 2 BE LIVING IN REAL TIME OF THIS REMARKABLE QUEEN 👑 🐝.
YEEEEEHAA TEXAS!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎉
🐝💛💛💛🐝🐝🐝
Lovvvvvvvve it B
Yeehaw🎉
O Primeiro show do act II será em Bahiiiiaaaaaaa 🇧🇷
So now are we supposed to love country music?🤣🙄
time to enter a cowgirl era
so cheap no value,end of the world is near
We were doing the Electric Slide during the Renaissance now we’re about to be Line Dancing! 😭
🙅🏽‍♀️
Now if shes not invited to the country music awards..
I absolutely LOVE THIS Beyonce! Your talent is limitless!
Oh she ate that up
One album... Only a few that are good to listen to 😅
EU AMEI
The Queen is coming for CMA! Let's go!
Imagine her and Taylor on tour together 🤩

#BARBEY ❤❤❤❤
Ela voltou com tudoooo!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Minha nova personalidade em 2024 🤠
I love it
Beyoncé is doing a country soul album.  So far shit sounds good.  👍  I'm glad someone is finally reclaiming OUR music.
"Daddy Lesson" disco cowboy hats & Taylor Premiere were all her planning for Country Grammy! & Every other ARTIST OF THE CENTURY AWARD! 🎉👏🏽💯👏🏽🎉
Appropriation is ugly
I like country now
im here for country music!!!
Suddenly I’m wearing a straw hat moseying around with a piece of straw hanging off my bottom lip
Beautiful Song
Beautiful Song
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay 💚♍
I listen to country music. This is nice. Beyonce is talented. 😂😂😂
Uaaataaafoookiiiii😮
I hope she add Gaga on this album
Can’t wait to line dance with my grandma to this I’m being so fr
Im feelin this
I remember when I first saw Dolly Parton in Best Little… And she sang Hard Candy Christmas. It was an evolution for a lil black boy. This gives me the same shivers
Amando ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Já tô com o chapéu pronto mamãe , dia 29/03 act II
Why do people forget she is from Texas
WOW I LOVE THIS!! ❤️
Everything Bey and J did for the Grammy's was so intentional lol and I love it!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
ATEEEE
And still don’t get a CMA nomination 😩🤔
Bey is going to convert so many people into country music fans!! This is sooo good!!
So she  can wear her boobs all out but nicki does it and it’s she’s old and bitter . Okay
This ain’t Texas . Ain’t no hold em! Periodt. Let’s go Queen B.
REGARDS. THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH. MUHAMMAD WAS ALLAH'S APOSTLE. ENTER ISLAM. MUST KNOW THE MEANING OF THE AL-QUR, AN. EVERYTHING AND UNDERSTAND GOD'S WORD. WE WILL DIE.............
The fact that somebody who is already a legend like Beyoncé keeps getting better and cooler is such a lesson
Just when ya'll thought it was safe to put away the disco cowboyhats. lol.
❤
INTERESTING!!!
OMGGGGGGGGGGGG
What the hell was that?
Wow, I love this!
Queen B ❤🇧🇷
That’s the Doug theme song they’re whistling….
❤
Can’t wait for the album!
OMFG RU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW???🤠🤠🤠
Lawd. Now I gotta buy some cowgirl boots.😂
Meu namorado amou essa música
❤🐝👑🇧🇷
There was no attempt to even make a vid clip. Sad.
Sigh. Why are y’all ignoring Morgan Wallen who’s actually doing real country music for this? Because it’s Beyonce? I said it on her 16 Carriages visualizer and I’ll say it here in a different way. Country is kinda like HipHop in the sense that authenticity matters. If Bey were to release a HipHop album I’m sure many fans would cringe and it won’t have anything to do with hating on your Bey. Many of us have already heard her rap a little bit and it’s not bad actually, it’s not that she can’t do it if she wanted to, but I don’t want to hear an entire rap album from her. I’ve heard r&b artists from Lauryn Hill to Nicki (who sings a little bit) that do the HipHop thing really well already. Well…same here. I’m not even the biggest country music fan but even I know enough country to know that this ain’t it. Even pop country has authentic country to it. C’mon now.
I just saw some boobs sorry.
down…Down…DowN…DOWN!!! 🔥
My Queen
Queen B blessing us with a country music 🔥🔥🔥
Que perfeição ❤
❤❤❤❤
Am I the only one at home making up my own line dance RIGHT NOW!!!!😊😊😊
Heck she from TEXAS...boots and all.  Y'all ackin brand new! Yup!  ♥️🤠♥️🤠😂😜
I keep coming back💃🏽🕺🏽💃🏽🕺🏽
I LOVE U BEYONCEEEEEE
We must win this Album of the year award from the Grammys we aren’t playing anymore about it! 🔥 ❤🎉
Come on Beyonce!
Love love love
Beyoncé will collect country music awards like infinity stones soon.
😍😍
She’s coming for that country music award 🥇
She literally went from Cunty to Country.
Yes Queen Bey ❤❤❤
❤
Almighty el rey de reyes!!!👹
Love this, country music has great lyrics. A Dolly duet would be 🥰
Si a todo.
😅
So " brave" and stunning""
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
slave to the devil
So this why she lightened her skin
J’adore je retrouve Beyoncé dans toute sa splendeur ❤
Loveee you ❤
Wow 🚀
THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTING AND I LOVE IT
Lindaaa❤
aqui ela ta fazendo história
Beyoncé ❤
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤❤
One thing my GOOD SIS IS GONNA DO IS BREAK THE INTERNET 🛜 BEYONCÉ FOR PRESIDENT 💐 I had A dream you were ! Love Angela 💖
Soooo old town road paved the way for new black country 😂   This sounds great 😊
So boring, cliqued country music sound with no highlight. Shame she felt need to get her breasts out to promote this song
Song like gospel music 😮😮
Never cared for her, but she in her country era and im here for it
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Beyoncé is the real GOAT!!!
I'm requesting a Beyonce and K Michelle collab.
Genius! This is the definition of a TRUE ARTIST. She can literally do any genre and make it HER and give the listener a different perspective about that genre. This country sound is COMPLETE FIRE! I am an artist and INSPIRED! Do YOU BEY!
The devils handlers been trying to destroy country music artists for yrs country family look out for each other  they welcome others in but nobody’s gonna bring any bs into there world. Sometimes people need a shift in their life. Pull themselves out of darkness to walking the path of righteousness sometimes we all need to do that
Thats mother
Simplesmente amei essa música 🤩🐝
Im here for this , them bridges chick. ❤❤❤❤.... Pave the way.
❤
Cultural appropriation
Can I feel em 😂
Lemme go get my horse and cattle 🤠
I love you. Learned English bc I wanted to understand your songs 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
We country in Texas
😍😍😍😍
We Got Beyoncé Singing Country Before GTA 6
I've been waiting for this since "Daddy Lessons".
Beyonce is pathetic.
I am loving this one!! She is putting her cute flair on it too! As per usual. 😍 Don't be a Bish come take it the flo now ooooo
Where did she find the time to make new music, the tour only finished a few months ago?
I’m feeling this
It got everything to be country except the accent.
This is 🔥🔥🔥 go Bey 🤠
Welcome to the Wild West everybody ❤
Mother? Genre queen? Volatile Queen mother? Yee HAWW
Rainha 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Was lady gaga right all this time and we didn't see it at that time?
Visuals Born This Way era, Sound Joanne era. Sorry Bey, Gaga did it first and better!
she claimed an other genre !!!
❤
TX, Mexico
Toujours à poil mdr obligé de monter son cul et ses seins même passer 40 ans c pathétique  Amen comme elle dit à l’église 😂😂
Ima Lyft driver who drives a Lexus !  And a Virgo who loves country music I feel seen !
This is terrible lmao
🔥🔥🔥🔥Queen B never disappoints with her music🎶she is an amazing singer.
this ate
Yonce I love it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is she trying to shift to taylor's genre 🤔 i don't mean it in a negative way.  I'm unexpectedly amazed!  🔥🤌😍
She never fails
She made sure to speak about Texas, whisky, tornados, poker, dive bars, slow dancing, drinking, hoe-downs and boogie.  I almost hear the car wash scene of the general Lee from a certain blonde bombshell in parts of this. I guess that qualified her for country music.
I am going to learn all the lyrics
Beyoncé Beyoncé Beyoncé Beyoncé BABYYYYYY!!!!!!! This is what an artist looks like. The ability to do every genre.
Te amo, meu amor😊😊
Let's go B!
OMG Beyoncé Country é reaaaal, pode vir pra Barretos, Rainha. O festival é seu, meu amor!
Rainha diva ❤
They always never wanted you to go country. But f---k them. Kick in that door Bey and make'm see you. Hell yes we support you. Love it.🖤🖤🖤
We need more black artist to bring this back. I know there’s a lot of em now but it needs a bigger push. We created why not? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Looking forward to all the TikTok vids of sisters line dancing to this tune.
Oh the ending was so ethereal!!! I’m so ready for WHATEVER is on this album!

Ok Miss B!!! Whooo🔥
Okay Bey!!! I love this!! ❤️
A mulher faz tudo
My sistah Beyonce ❤ love it sis
‼️People who claim one specific race own country music - The origins of country music can be traced to the 17th century, when European and African immigrated to North America brought their folktales, folk songs, favorite instruments
i literally like it because it is beyoncé, i really am not a fan of country music
She is trying to get that Grammy for album of the year, if you can't beat them, join them hihi 🤠 I'm here for it 😅❤
come to brazil queen 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
It’s your year every year 🤍
16 Carriages- makes me wanna cry 🥺 Texas Hold ‘Em- makes me wanna dance 🤠
Dolly parton is hanging her head in dismay...this is nice but sounds like an experiment and just fun for B.
Eu amei ❤
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Me encanta ❤❤❤ y escucho y pienso en lady gaga en joanne 🎉
Where is the line dance Queen?????? We ready!!! ❤🤠🤠🤠🎊🎉🎊  As a black woman that was raised on country music I’m here for this! #Beyonce #MickeyGuyton
This is SO FKING GOOOOOOD
Beyoncé finally comes home to her roots, to Texas and their country music. I'm not a fan of this music, but i'm pretty sure, her fans will go crazy :)
Mana vc hitou muitooo🤠🐝
💖
Never forget  beyonce  from houston!!!!
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
Beyonce, girl ❤❤❤
Tony Tone Toni has done it again!!! Feels Good!
Ooo Beyonce at the CMAs
Here at 629k views - I can’t wait till this reaches millions 😊 mother is back !
That jacket holding on by the grace of god and prayer🫣. Bey is here to make country glamorous and YES
Chocada beyonce asim do nada mana
I hope she adds black country artist as features to show support to these amazing unseen artists
Неожиданно 🙆🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️.  Хоть Бейонсе экспериментирует со звучанием периодически.  Но прям 2 песни в кантри стиле от нее я не ожидала в качестве первых синглов. И альбом, получается, тоже будет кантри.  Мне не очень близко кантри, но интересно, интересно...🤔😝
ODE TO QUEEN BEY CHILDHOOD ROOTS I ALSO FEEL THAT RENAISSANCE PART II WILL BE BETTER THAN PART 1!
Texas, where they steal your bodily autonomy so She rewards them with a terrible country song?!! 😳🤬 trash
Omg mother😮
Holy Dolly Parton 😮
I see all the Black folks who had nothing but insults, demeaning comments, and “why you listening to White music” remarks are suddenly coming out the woodworks pretending like they were fans of this genre all along. I especially love the people who suddenly know the history behind country music. If Beyonce came out with a metal album, you’d come with the same brand of fakeness as if you weren’t clowning people who sincerely liked that genre and are naturally musically diverse…. Two-faced assholes.
O Brasil te ama 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Think it’s Pretty Cool 🩵Beyonce’ made a Country Song 🎶 it’s actually sounds nice Beyonce voice is Amazing 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾 this is be a # 1 Hit 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Y'all hear country, I hear blues
Countryoncé is 🔥🔥🔥  I'm loving it ! Her voice is so smooth
... and this Lady still hasn't won AOTY ? Hey Grammy's ?! WTF ?
Ho' DOWN! THROW DOWN! What a COWGIRL ❤
Well damn the Grammys hurt your feelings you can’t do country
crap song
Smells of desperation.  I mean come on - dabbling in an unlikely genre while showing your tits smells like a giant publicity stunt.  What's next - a Spanish language album?
Country music was stolen from black people made by black people glad Beyoncé and also lil naz x and alo blak went back and picked up what was always ours 🎉
WOW! Act II!
Eu já amooooo, gratidão mommy! 👑✨
👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾💥💥💥🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
Beyoncé never disappoints me ... i'm going through complicated times, but I've just found joy again !  Hope can be found everywhere, indeed. Thank God for that ❤
The lyrics is pure 🗑🗑🗑
Why does she have to be half naked. Let the singing speak for it self which is good by the way
Queen
🇦🇴🫶🏾🫶🏾
Yessss
Wait why this eating
The greatest.
This album gon' be a giving one , we can't wait mother ❤!!!!  Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lana estava certa... tudo virando country
Adorei!! Automaticamente me lembra de filmes com temática faroeste. Espero que os visuais desse 2° ato(que também espero que tenha) faça várias referências a eles.❤
❤❤❤
ual
If you dress like that you are no country
I wasn't a B fan til this very moment ! .  Hell YEAH  THIS IS FABULOUS °🤍!.
I can absolutely see a roadtrip to a lake with all my camping gear with my dog and this song blasting
Rugged wiskey 0:49 - so smooth...could listen to this on loop all day
This song is a wast of time 😢 don’t like it at all
Tudo pra mim
Go Beyonce 😂😂😂😂😂
Just told me husband to get used to country like he wants me to get used to camping!
I love it 😍
I knew the next album would be a country album
Elle aurait pu attendre que l'album de usher cartonne un peut sale connasse
A maior
Rainha

POV 2025 GRAMMY AWARDS: "And the grammy for best country song goes to...*opens envelope* BEYONCÉ!!!!!!!"🎉❤ SHE TAPPED WAY DEEP DOWN TO HER ROOTS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THAT TEXAN SASS!
Perfeita!!!
So Lana Del Rey and Beyoncé are doing country 😭
Vc acredita que eu amo country ? Pois eu amo
É muita perfeição , como que pode. E agt já consegue imaginar ela performando essa música. Junto com SUGA MAMA.
shes doing a country music now ....she misses her hometown ? or she wants the album of the year lol
Remember when Beyonce showed her Movie in Israel while they were genociding Palestinians and didn't pull it after she got called out? 😊
I AM READY MOM!!!
The swag dripping from the "don't be a bitch come take it to the floor now" 🔥
Gente isso e um surto coletivo? Digam que sim.😮
Agora sou obrigada a comprar um cavalo uma bota e um chapéu 😂😂😂
Hopefully she can bring more fans  from both sides to finally open up to listen, appreciate and enjoy each other genres! I’ve been a big fan of hers since Sasha album but I’m so here for this specific era for Beyonce 3.29 marked on the calendar.
https://youtu.be/wa--U0DVyRU?si=EJ6l8ZZY5qikIUhL
you don't even write your own songs
😍💚💚
IM NOT READY TO LET GO OF THE RENAISSANCE BUT AHHHH

I love country music and I love Beyonce.  I am in hog heaven.
Unique!
Bey & Kay taking over county 🌹🥰💯🍫
you picked exactly the right time to realise these 2 songs, while people are dying in Rafah - Gaza, you throught ”oh, wait, is the perfect time to put the spotlight on me, and not on the people that are suffering”. F YOU and F the superbowl
Perfeita
Let me go get me some cowboy boots and start line dancing cuz this ain’t Texas but I’m gonna take it to the floor now. Ooh
RAINHAAAAAAAAAAA❤❤❤
I've never been a beyonce fan. I was a huge Destiny child's fan but after they broke up I wasn't interested in listening to beyonce. her music didn't really resonate with me. but this country shit, speaks to my soul lmfao. she making a fan out of me with these.
Jirka kolbe ❤️😘

The Super Bowl ad and this form a 'jumped the shark' moment.Least the Destiny's Child reunion tour just became A LOT more likely.

White people know why Beyonce doing Country.....She coming for Taylor...
Beyonce wtf visual is this? Its just repeating itself. YOU could've done better than this.😂😂😂 bsffr.  Also country? Ugh.
This country track hits so good 😮 as Beyonce shoot ❤
Real talent this one 😢😢😢
Beyonce is doing Country cause she so desperate for a AOY Grammy she is so desperate she would do Country just for that reason alone...sad
Talvez agora eles deem uma Grammy a ela
That's Beyonce I 😮 ai mode in effect
Welp I guess it’s time I like country music as a Louisiana girl 😭🩵🐝
Well this is different  Reneissance visuals please!
OK MAMMAAAAA
Maravilhosa, energia muuuuuuuito boa ❤❤❤🇧🇷

this is not country, this is CUNTRY 💋
Daddy lessons and now this ❤
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸 🍉🍉 USE YOUR PLATFORM
Não sou fã de música country, mas em 2024 vou ser ❤😮😂😅
I don’t think there’s anything that this woman cannot sing, she has just kicked the bar completely out of the playing field. She’s in a league all by herself, and she knows it. All I can say, is that high to you, Beyoncé, for going there, because country music has its roots with Black people, and it always has, and nothing can ever change. The fact, I love the fact of the matter that there is absolutely nothing that, you haven’t been able to sing that you have tried that. So this is just something all together special and just very likable.
Karma is fair but a merciless bitch. We Got our Album Of the Year 🥰❤ Yee-haw!
LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bringing country back home 🫶🏾. Love to see it.
Country is the new vibe for sure, and I'm from the frozen north lmao
Beyoncé is making me proud of being a Texan!  (I have never even set a foot in that state)
Vou gozarr❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Beyoncé has gone full rodeo on this. She's basically an epitome of an artist with no limits.
This song better than all reinssaince eraa
RECLAIMING OUR TIME!
0:45 she's finally opening up about the Beysment
loooooove this
Love the vocal layering- really showing that country twang through those back vocals while still delivering clearly

Song for Terri Joe
All of a sudden her outfit for the Grammys made sense😅
I love country Bey! The Line Dance invents itself. Let's take it back... and Show them how it's done!  🐝🐝🐝
I ❤️ love this song!!!!
Beyonce doesn't even a album to prove she's Beyonce. ❤️
Queen beyonce is the best.
Beyonce ft taylor
Yep  QUEEN BEYONCE did country in coleb wirh "Chris Stapleton ft Beyonce - Tennessee Wiskey. So sit your ASSS down haters 😂
We need a fire line dance 4 this👯‍♀️ 🤠
act i - house, disco, ballroom act ii - country, bluegrass, folk. act iii - rock, blues, jazz.  thank you for reclaiming historically black art forms, beyoncé. thank you for always paying homage to the past, crediting and paying people, and pushing the culture forward.   those of us who get it, will ensure that your sacrifices will never be in vain. we love and appreciate you so much. ❤️
I live in a small country town in texas, so I'm gonna ride down these country dirt roads and listen to texas hold em..😂😊❤
Es la nueva tendencia del pop: el country.
Tbh this is a Taylor swift move when she went from country to pop. I love country music so I'm here for it.
WOMAN I WAS ASLEEP
4+4 = 8 down once again ♥️♥️🫶🏾
The song is nothing great but great nakedness
❤❤❤❤
Miley cryus remix to this would be great
Ok I'm here before 1M whatever good that'll do me 😂
A maior que nós temos 😮‍💨❤️🥹
Hee How🔫🐎🤠  Wow🤩 Queen Bey👸🏽🐝
versatile queen
Ohwww country music IS not for me 😔
WE ARE GETTING THE VISUALS
Country does not suit her.
So I'll be blasting country music now 😂😂😂
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
Mrs Beyonce Giselle Knowles Carter!!!Yes ma'am 🔥🔥🔥
Get up and get ready for work.... but Beyonce dropped new music I'm frozen 😮😊🥰
😅😅😅
I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT TOUR!! MOTHER JUST SHOWING THE WORLD SHE CAN DO IT ALL 🤠🤠
DIS AINT A VISUAL LOL
ok WHATTTT
I rather my daughter look up to Beyoncé than these rapper girls
Na sola da bota com a mamãe! 🤠❤️🐝🇧🇷✨
How will she perform country live with a rnb catolong?
I’m so excited for this album. I LOVE country music. Country is commonly overlooked by a lot of people, even though real country music (not the pop stuff) is firmly rooted in soul and blues, which most people love. It’s dope that so many more people might learn to love country music, and hopefully a good number of OG country fans who usually dismiss Queen Bey might decide to check for her, too!
🐝🐝🐝🐝  🇧🇷
Jesus Christ is coming soon.
gorgeous ❤❤❤❤❤❤ iconiccc🎉🎉🎉
Unpopular opinion: I prefer the Dangerously in Love Beyoncé era. Still such a classic album.
She is next level
Música ruim da gota serena 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
BEYONCÉÉÉÉÉÉ
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Darkness preceded light and She is Mother
Vamos subi esse louvor ❤❤
i see lady gaga here
Line dance going to be bonkers!
Like this comment if you love Beyoncé
Thank god she’s singing again. Not just a load of talking over a backing track …
You look fine, fine, fine Put your feet up next to mine We can watch that water line get higher and higher Say, say, say Hasn't it been some kind of day? You and me been catching on like a wildfire  Got the same vibe as John Mayer's little stint into the genre with Born & Raised and Paradise Valley. I'm here for it.
Rainha 👸🏽 ❤
That banjo was generic and souless. Curiosity brought me here.. Disappointment is why I'm leaving. Go get you some Bishop Gunn, try "Alabama", "Devil is Women" or maybe even "Shine". Can't go wrong with that last one. They make Country Rock, Soul/Blues. This song might be too popish for me.. Pop music be twisting my ears like that knee slap stuff the country scene has been doing.. Lord knows I can't.
Pew pew ❤❤
Meu Deus ameiiiiiiii❤❤❤❤
😮😮😮
Every time she releases a new album, her music genre changes. Very interesting. That's how you grow your fan base. By making music for everyone.
Why is she announcing new music? Like.. before she dropped it before a announcement. What is different?
The irony to drop this kind of music in black history month is crazy but also typical Bey shit! 🔥
Beyonce is trying to break history and win and Grammy  in every category
I really  like this !!!
Why she wears like a bitch?! She's a mother so let her shows some respect to her kids!!
Where is Taylor Swift 😅
Mama not you making me expend my musical taste
All I know is Queen B‘s legit. She from Texas after all
Beautiful queen love country music ❤️🎵🫶👐🙏
'Daddy lessons' being my favourite song is finally paying off😂
Bey conquers every single genre. A Generational talent!!
Don't be a bitch, Come take it to the floor now!! 🤠
Yall better Iine dance your asses off 🖤 take it to the flo
That's a mother of how many?😍
omg?
Bey u just unbelievable! Thank you for being a Texan
🥰🔥🔥🩷🩷🩷
In love honey✨
If anyone is interested in discovering Black Country/Folk artists you can start with Allison Russell and Roberta Lea (Roberta is definitely influenced by Bey).
Beautiful

Bigfoot Outstreamed!!😊
I’m a fan of country music so I’m down!!!
Country music is such an underrated genre in the gen z culture.
So this explains the cowboy hat at the Grammys 🥹🔥😭
This just sounds like Beyonce she just got a southern drawl 🤷🏽 I like K Michelle country singing better not trying to compare, but Beyoncé girl no
Girl!!!! So goood!!! That’s all, that’s the whole story!
❤Beyonce ❤
We all wanted this after daddy lesson   Thank you bey 😊😊❤️
A True Renaissance woman
❤❤❤
Let me go head and get my cowboots, hat, and stomach flat for summer and BLACK tiktokers where are the line dancing choreo! So donw with twerking lets give country something to be mad about
AAAAAA 🫶🥹🥹
I know a lot of people are going to like this just because it's Beyonce 🤦🏽 Buutttt this is trash... I think she could have done a lot better if she's going to go country... 🤷🏽
Haaaaaa beyonce not even making announcements WHATTTTTT
This song is amazing, I luv her daddy lessons song and this album will be firework
The world could be such a wonderful place if only we would learn to let go of our anger, bitterness, division, and hatred. If we learned to love one another and to humbly serve one another, When God made humanity, he did so that all the people of this good earth, would love one another as brothers and sisters in Christ. We have so much potential to be a force for good in the world. All we need to do is let go of our pride and love the Lord and others with an open and willing heart. Jesus died on the cross as a free gift of salvation for us; it isn't based on self-righteousness. or based on our performance, it is only by God's great mercy and sacrifice when he died on the cross, when he took our punishment for our sins. The only thing that counts as righteousness is faith in Christ and what he has done for us. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Rejecting God's mercy will only lead to our eternal suffering and damnation. Sin is like a disease that, if left untreated, will destroy us, like cancer. Sin must be dealt with. which is why Jesus took our punishment for us; all we need to do is repent for our sins and place our faith solely in him. “It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” Luke 5:31-32  "Dear God, please forgive me of all my sins and wash me clean. I've chosen to trust in the finished work of your son, Jesus Christ. that when he suffered and died on the cross for my sins through his blood, they were washed away, lead, and guide me on the path you have chosen for my life; lead me away from anger and hatred; teach me to love and serve others as you've loved me."  Eternal suffering is horrifying; it is forever, and once dead, there is no escaping such a fate. That's why While we live, we need to turn to God for forgiveness. ''Anyone who says they do not sin is a liar, and there isn't truth within them.  Paraphrasing 1 John 1:8   ''But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  Matthew 5:28  You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God. don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,  Corinthians 1:6-9  But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart (from our thoughts), and these things defile a man. (Make us sinful and worthy of judgment.) For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.  ''Anyone who uses divination (consulting with psychics or mediums) practices witchcraft (Wicca) or claims to be able to predict the future through signs and omens (a false prophet) or a sorcerer (one who dabbles in black magic, or any other occultic teaching) is guilty of eternal damnation in the eyes of God'' (Hell is a place of intense physical and emotional suffering  and it is forever, for all eternity, there is no escaping it after death)  The punishment for dabbling in The occult in ancient times was harsh, you'd often be put to death by stoning or even by being burned at the stake, messing with the occult is serious, it's brought entire nations to it's knees  because of God's wrath (intense anger) and it is one of the greatest sins, man can do against God, because of Israel's rebellion in sacrificing their children the false canaanite gods (baal, astaroth and moloch), they suffered immensely over the course of history, especially when they were invaded and conquered by the Babylonian Empire. Only suffering comes from the use of such practices, suffering in this life and eternal suffering in the next.  Paraphrasing  Deuteronomy 18:10-12
beaaaaaaaaautiful!
Damn k Michelle
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
I'm a fan of everything she Does !  I Didn't like this ?  Trying to hard. Forecd singing to me on this one!😢

The vocals are outta this world; we all expect flawless from Beyonce but the tone in her voice is something extra special with this song. Further proof we are watching one of our generations greatest musical chameleons. She can do it all.
Love this! I love how innovative and creative she is!
Brasil
Que música linda ❤❤❤❤
I love country and Beyoncé got that for sure ❤❤❤❤❤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💃🏾💃🏾
She does what she wants and she does it good.
Beyonce is wrong coming out half naked not cute let the women in your life dress like this you would not be ok with it.
AYYYYYYEEEEEEEEE
Ella vino a disparar a quien tenga enfrente 😍❤️‍🔥
King beyonce  strikes again🔥🔥

If Taylor can do it, Beyonce can do it better 🐎🎶🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
If you told me I would be the biggest country fan in 2024...
Lo hizo Madonna con Music y Lady Gaga con Joanne. Excelente Beyoncé

absolute garbage 🤣🤣
Wonder did she write this????
Damn this song ❤❤❤
😍😍😍😋❤❤ Le nouvelle album de Beyoncé arrive !
Ooooh luV this❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
That's a damn sexy futuristic country girl! ❤
I don’t think there’s anything that this woman cannot sing, she has just kicked the bar completely out of the playing field. She’s in a league all by herself, and she knows it. All I can say, is that high to you, Beyoncé, for going there, because country music has its roots with Black people, and it always has, and nothing can ever change. The fact, I love the fact of the matter that there is absolutely nothing that, you haven’t been able to sing that you have tried that. So this is just something all together special and just very likable.
Feels like people like her music just cuz shes Beyonce. I don’t follow the crowd… I speak what I truly feel and this is just “not my kinda style of music “
Beyonce ate
Wow love how it sounds..  😊😊
It's good!
We will be streaming and purchasing
🔥🔥🔥
I hope her kids don’t watch this and see their mother is a porn star
Girl I saw the sign with that Grammy outfit!
All I wanna know is will you be at the rodeo??
She’s so desperate to win the big Grammy that she’s resorted to country music
i just know third part will be rock
♥️☀️☀️♥️
She has perfect voice for country music.
OMG 😮❤
I fucking knew she was gonna do a country ablum😭
🤞🏻 for a Dolly collab ❤
Heres the visuals y'all been asking ❤💥🔥
I was wrong about Beyoncé. I have sooooo much respect for her! This makes me so happy 😊. She truly is a real one.
This song is such a vibe, can not wait for the tour
She is white
BeeHaw yall
Queen B happy song l luv❤
Texas We 🆙🆙🆙🤠🐝🫶🏾
Definitely gonna listen to the whole album when its comes out but aint there's no way it's gonna be better than renaissance act i
No matter what keep showing up! 🤠
Aquela música perfeita pra pegar a estrada 😍❤️
I love how she just took her time and said ok now I'm coming back and I'm doing the Music I WANT, go girl
Love it bey you are so into your craft you nail every genre ❤
Now the Grammys outfit makes more sense than her just being from Texas ❤️ goodness she's at the top give this woman her flowers!
Yippee Calle, you just sold out !
I loooooooveeeee Beyoncé but she kinda fell off in my opinion
❤❤❤
Beyonce i see what you are doing !!! Taking back country music during black history month she is a very intentional artist ❤❤❤❤ love it
I’m not a fan of country but i’m loving this!
It is so nice to see this. Black people invented country music and it was just taken over. So many people don’t realize this and I love that she is bringing awareness.
❤
Luna squirell
This made me question my sexually
This woman can literally do anything and I'll give her my money
Ce qui étonnant c'est qu'elle n'a toujours pas un prix pour l'album de l'année c'est vraiment n'importe quoi
Beyonce has an irreproachable talent!!😮
This is awesome i been seeing raise in more and more black country singer and for Beyonce footprint in there . I might watch the CMA for the first time .
We‘re now ALL country fans 🤣❤️‍🔥
Con Beyoncé y Lana Del Rey todos vamos a amar el Country ❤
I'm not a Beyoncé fan but I'm here for POC taking back country music 🙌🏻
BEYYY QUEENNNNNNNNNNN
so she going country
does this mean C&W wins?
Now I think she will have her album of the year at the Grammys
Nahh this sounds like a soundtrack to an animated movie about a cowgirl princess. Bey wasn’t reading the international room. This is to USA foced
Although sonically obviously a different genre for Beyonce, lyrically it's giving callbacks to her 4 Era wich was criminally underrated and overlooked. An album with in my opinion some of her best vocals, like Love on top, Best thing I Never had, 1+1 and Countdown. Loved Act 1, can't wait for Act 2.
Ok, girl, getting my purse ready for you
Ive always been a country girl so i love this 🥰her voice is perfect for this kind of music, (ANY kind of music if we're being honest 🤷🏾‍♀️)
i’ve been waiting for another country bey song since daddy lessons, LOVE IT
❤❤❤❤❤😭😭😭I LOVE YOU BEYONCE FROM 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
YESSSS BEY!! THIS LADY WORKS HARDER THAN KRIS JENNER😮
Y’all are so annoying not liking what y’all deem yt ppl ish but as soon as a black person does join yr down, it’s disingenuous and ironic cuz yall never there for the smaller blk artists in those genres and a lot of them originated with blk ppl
Loathe country, but I just became a fan! 🔥 🔥
YESSSS YESS YESS AND YESS
Texas ish !!!!!
howdy🤠
Ser fã é nao ter um dia de paz 😅❤
Me encantaaaaa...Te amo Bey 😍😭🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Explains everything about the 2024 Grammys look … Ouuuu 10 outta 10
I need a beyonce documentary on renaissance pt 1 and 2 bc there is so much depth to the concepts and production of them that i need analysis on hahhaa
Well she white now so and country woman doesn't dress like that.
This is different I like it. Creative.
Don’t be a Beech come take it to the floor now 💨 🔥
❤
The visuals alone f'ed it up. She trying too hard now, way too hard. She could have at least kept it classy.
Beyoncé takes me by surprise every damn time 😅😮❤🌟💨
Who knew we needed this 😍

Yessssss BB!!! Beyhive let's goooooo!!!!! 💃🐝🔥
It’s time to start singing county now!! ❤
cant wait for she performs this on act 2 tour ❤️❤️❤️
The way I ran here, I almost fell ❤❤❤❤
No one does it like Beyoncé in music today, she is the only one with this much creative agency to challenge herself with all genres of music and put her own soul and style into it and pull it off so well !!! Love how she is highlighting all black american music.
Oh my gooooood, Beyonceee❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉u r my heartt
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She makes you listen, dance and celebrate your self with every song. A change maker!!!
They played K Michelle when she was doing country....i wonder how this will go come grammy time. I'm here for it
I can see this being one of her best albums! 🤠
culture appropriation.... sorry i been waiting for my moment and it arose lmaooooo
Im not a fan of country music but you still killed it B.

Just when K. Michelle was about to be my new favorite country artist 🥴
I LOVED IT!🧡
THEM : Who is your favourite country artist ?  Me : Beyonce !!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉
So I guess we are wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat for thw next tour?😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beyoncé isn’t the only one going into the Country genre. Lana Del Rey has a new Country album coming in September 2024.
IN ITALY WE SAY ORC0D10 SE CANTO ERA ORA
Beyonce got tired of Taylor Swift earning Album of the Year at the Grammy's so she comes out with a country album.
08:57h Bravo za Beyonce, da je ona vladala divljim zapadom, on nikada ne bi bio divlji, nego bi njime vladala ljubav i sadile bi se ruže posvuda!!!Bravo!!!
Perfect 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
I wanna hear K.Michelle sing country as well.
🤠🌻
It's the versatility for me‼️ C'mon Bey‼️ THIS IS A TRUE ARTIST. Bey said watch me sing and dance through EVERY genre. And make it mine😂.
Come 🐝 i need a line dance for my wedding ❤
Yes Bey! A country album! I’ve been wonder what genre you were going to explore next. I know the gospel album will be a classic too!
Ela pensa em tudo ❤
🥰🥰🥰
Zero originality. Snooze fest
Beyonce doing best things 🎉😮
oooh yass!!! love it....
Omg
Yes yes yes ❤
“Woooow horsey ”😂😂😂 It amazes me how she permeates through every genre of art she wants to!!! ❤
The Grammy outfit makes sense now
I had no idea I was going to become a country music fan in 2024. But here we are.
Whew!!! Her TIMING is so unmatched!!! Swifties are in April and she is a month before! Just think about the GRAMMYS next year!!! 🐝🐝🐝🐝
I'm with this!!
I hear Halle at the end
Damn
Waking up to Act 2... Dream come true😭
Oooh Beyoncé is picking up where she left off with "Daddy Lessons" in 2016! That Song was Fire and hella country!  Come on through, Boo! I love this song and that immaculate "16 Carriages"!!!!  👑Beyoncé Is the consummate artist! She takes risks, breaks rules, does what she's not supposed to and works harder, wiser, outperforms the rest! 👑
this is lady gaga u copycat
I think you should do a video of you and others square dancing to your music… would be pretty cool…
NOT MY SHOT OF WHISKEY
Mother ❤, take your flowers 🎉Beyonce. An absolute Genius ❤️‍🔥
YEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAA Beyonce is coming in on that horse ! WOOOOOO
DADDY LESSONS HIVE IS UP BY 9000!!!!
It’s giving act ii world tour
Im liking this
Great job Beyoncé 👏 👍 🤠😎
🏇🎠🐎
My gorgeous goddess ❤❤❤❤
THE IMPACT OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY MORGAN WALLEN IS CRAZY
I love you ❤🥺
Her vocals are beautiful. This is fum. i hope there is a clean version with no profanity. Clean music fit for playing around children and all family is harder to fond than in my childhood.
So this explains her Grammys outfit!
I wonder if Bey & K-Michelle will make a song together this round.
Beyoncé you always wow us ! 🔥🔥🤠🐝🐝🙌🏾🫶🏾🤎🤌🏾
This woman can do no wrong   !!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 love you B
I like it!

What is this...  😭😭😭😭😭😭
Low rate boring video but the song is fun.
Oh Beyoncé! The woman that you are! Whew!! Hey!!!
İmmoral and disgusting. She's becoming cheaper and cheaper.  Showing up almost naked doesn't support your talent. Why acting like a stripper when you've got a talent at both singing and dancing. Disgusting
THE GREATEST ARTIST OF ALL TIME! DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I am not really a fan of country. But I liked a few country songs.
I already got my ACT II tour outfit picked out lol 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤
Beyonce had Brest lift

I hate country music but Beyonce voice make it full course menu like i belong to Texas

Você não cansa de nos surpreender não!? 😍🥰❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fun fact: Country music was really popular in many african countries among black people like in Zimbabwe, South Africa ,Zambia etc..my weekends as a kid where spent listening to my mum playing Dolly Parton, Don Williams. She always said Black Americans also helped start country music. So l'm here for this Beyoncé back to country roots album❤❤!
:(
Terry joe is loving it

Love❤❤
Act 3 gonna be Trap Bey! I love when she raps!

Congratulations from Madrid, Spain! As everything you do, always well thought. Good music coming up!
Beyonce is Revolutionary 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Sex, violence, run where the wind takes you, shallow song, boring harmonies, she is really a loser
Now i'd like to see a Duet with Miley Cyrus.
The BEST part, it’s not a gimmick - Texas and the south is her actual roots. #HTown 🤠
Wait a minute....are we getting another album....a COUNTRY album?🥳🥳😭
I like it blk culture needs a reset with new enlightening music for once

I am in LOVE. there is something so bittersweet with this song. It talks about an ugly tornado ravaging her basement, the city. then there’s the heatwave where it’s “too hot to think straight” but “too cold to panic”; so they head down to the bar to drink and dance and forget, just for a little while.  not sure if it’s intentional but I sense a reflection on the current climate crisis and how it just might be too big to comprehend. these disasters keep coming at us, destroying homes and the land and our health, but they haven’t destroyed US and “I’ll be damned if I can’t dance with you!”   on one hand a gorgeous taking back of her Country, and on the other (or at the same time) a piece on the indomitable spirit of human love in the face of calamity. I am soooo excited for more.
Stops video to play on my T.V!!! I refuse to watch this on my phone! Lol for real doe.🐝 Yessss Ma'am B!! Give it to em!!

So she really wasn't playing when she said, "Drop the new music" during that Super Bowl Commercial
She said - bye grammys and, hello again CMAs.  #daddysgirliscountrytoo
I'm claims Grammy album of the year for 2025 for this album
One thing I can say is when Beyonce does finally retire she will have left it all on the floor in music, because she's giving us all the music in her. She's leaving such a beautiful legacy. Beyonce is bringing back alot of the music that was stolen from the BLK community and bring it back home were it started from.. nothing but love for her and what she is doing ❤

Who else here before 1 million???
This is so significant for a mega star like Beyonce to do this. While there are few African American music artists that have made headway into country and old veterans like the late Charley Pride,  most don't know the roots of African Americans and country.  Growing up, I  just thought it was white folks music and culture because it was never played at my house or by other Black people.  My dad loved watching cowboy movies, who at the time were mostly portrayed as white men, which just further confirmed what I thought. In high school when I became president of FFA (Future Farmers of America), I was the only Black officier, and the white officers and members  always dressed  with cowboy and cowgirl aesthetics. I never did because I had never notice Black people wearing such clothes where I'm from, even though I was living in the country.  During the state rally competition, I swept all categories from public speaking to meat judging and was headed to nationals. It wasn't until I talk to my grandpa that I learned a little bit of history.  He ask me did I have my cowboy outfit ready for nationals. I said hell no ; Black people don't wear that stuff. He said, who told you that. I told him  I had never notice anyone wearing it. He got up and show me some old pictures of him and his friends with their cowboy hats, jeans, ties, big silver belt buckle and boots. I was floored. and then he told me about all the Black people that had migrated west and started settlements that were sometime overrrun by whites if they were doing well. He then took me shopping to by me an outfit. I asked him why did he nor my dad tell me. He said because I didn't ask and to them it wasn't important.  They were to busy trying to survive and put food on the table. It's good to see Beyonce do this to continue to reclaim Black history. Even though she is far from the first,  the star power she brings is important.  From blues trail ride music, country music, old historic Black western settlements like Nicodemus, KS,  and  finally to black Cowboy movies finally being made, it is long overdue for the historical connections between African Americans and country to be reveal. It has never been White only.
She’s definitely in a league of her own
Great Beyoncé!!
Amazing
Im here before 1M ❤
I like it but ima wait and see. Country can have soul, it ain’t gotta be gimmicky.
I knew you were gonna do country
B$tch, I carry!! This is perfection already!! Fox Force 5 would not have been cancelled after the pilot if she was the main star!! This album is going to amazing!!!
Her voice is perfect for country I loved her song daddy’s lesson and was hoping for more country music from her I’m happy 😊

Yeehaw 🤠
Reclaiming Country. I like it!! We need a spicy line dance now. Who’s going to choreograph it for the cookouts this summer?
QUEEEEN
U deserve all the success. If only our people can believe that hard work pays off and that we deserve success. We’re so afraid to explore our inner personalities. What we’re afraid to show the world is what they’d love! Here for it Sis ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 (I need to take my own advice too ) 🥰
Who cares about album of the year when we got music of the millennium!!!!!!????
I THOUGHT SHE WAS JOKING! SHE'S ACTUALLY DROPPING THE MUSIC
🥰❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Daddy’s lesson and now this ❤ I love u so bad

Beyoncé to Morgan Wallen: Hold my beer.
Beyoncé sua lindaaa.

Wake up
As a long-standing Beyhive you know Bey has wanted to go to her roots, of course she naturally adds an R&B twist, her voice can’t help it, from DC, Daddy’s lessons, clues on Formation, this shit will probably be the proudest project for Mama Tina & Matthew who have always loved country. Texas stand TF up! 👏🙌🏼
Beyoncé's country era is here, y'all! 🤠🐎🖤
WOW
This one is definitely giving country... I need a movie to match this sound!
❤❤
Don’t like this
Madonna did it better. This is awful!
Sounds like Franklin theme song
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Act I is house/disco Act II is going to be country/folk  Act III I think is going to be either a jazz/blues/rock and roll album
Madonna did this 24 years ago and better. Nothing new 😊
Next time ride a horse without showing paschal boobs.real girl ride a cowboy

So we are all heading to the CMAs lol.  I mean, we are heading to country music, and for some of us, back to country music.  Happy Black History Month (another genre created by Black Americans)
🔥🔥
Beyoncé eu te amoooo!! ❤❤
❤❤❤
GET IT NO MATTER THE GENRE U NEVER FAIL TO DELIVER
The yeehaw agenda is here
If they give Beyoncé an "Album of the Year" Grammy for this country Album , I expect Taylor Swift to drop a rap album next and win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry – because at this point, anything is possible with the Grammy's.... Ticktoker G.A.TURKS
Been wondering when she'd do some country eyeing she's from Texas... The genre suits her voice
Sasha really be looking different ❤
Wear some clothes it ain’t cute anymore you’re a momma now
🩵🩵🩵

A vibe!
Always good to see Beyonce 🖤 *curtsy to the Queen
Makes me wonder what act iii will be— possible ballads?! I’m living for this!
Another couple of Grammys coming her way 😄.
Act 1 wasn’t the Rebirth for nothing! House/Electronic, Country, then Rock n Roll! Each genre originated by Blacks but we are not highlighted in! A pattern of an Album then Tour 3times 2022-2028 get off the horse & ride the bull!!!! Spread the word! 🐎🐮🎸
Here those of us who love queen b💋
Soy Ecuatoriano y simplemente es la perfección hecha humana. Gracias DIOS por permitirme poder vivir en el mismo siglo que esta REINA te amamos QueenB❤
Beyoncé really got me listening to Country music 😭  Well I meant Cuntry mursic 🤠
Im Now Starting To Get Why She Called Her Album Renaissance, She's about to be a jack of all trades in the music industry I got an inkling Act III Will Be a Rock album.
03:27 - 03:57 ✨ M A G I C ✨
Oh boy them 2 steps gonna be lit 😂😅😂😅

Ok, Bey, I guess I'm gonna be a Country fan now🫡🫡🫡
Aclamada sempre ❤ Mulher você pegou de surpresa! O brasileiro acorda com novidades! No meu caso me espantei e vir essa obra de arte ❤❤❤
❤ Beyoncé's voice fits perfectly in country music
Mamãe entrou na era country, só vem ato 2

You're talking to the ancestors the forebearers and and forefathers of country
Ok Bey love it

Absolutely beautiful record
Is it me or anyone else whos getting tired of nakes bodies?
She's really reclaiming the black music genres and bring him back to its roots. First it was house music, now it's country. Can't wait till she redeem rock and roll next.

Reverse Taylor Swift master plan in full effect!
Daddy lessons ??

Here for Countryonce 🤌🤌
i NEED to see this song in the next season of Young Sheldon
Let's go Yonce'
Queen 🎶 🎵  🪕 🎼  Forever Like King 2pac...❤❤❤
What an embarrassment to country music. I was expecting something that at least had a little bit of SOUL. This garbage is not bringing country music back, this is the kind of garbage that killed country music.
Watch her get Album of the year with Country Music!
Only B can do this 🎉
The 👑 always delivers!!! ❤️
Im not listening to this album but i love Beyonce
I've been waiting a long time to enjoy country music
She's very talented but I ain't feeling this. Afterwhile, her visuals are going to turn into porn.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
NINGUÉM DORME!
Wow, I didn’t expect this but country fits her voice very organically. I’ll be listening ❤
If this is Act II and you're doing a whole other genre of music........ommmmggggggggggGogaopi;gjpwroaiugo;QWYGH[wrnv [9uiowhgn' 0w
Act II drops next month? I can't wait
Me gustó ❤

Entregou demais
!!!!!!!!!!!
Glad I know how to line dance lol
Mdss mãeee
Pew pew pew it’s a 22 💃🏽
lol this is no where near country music just because you say Texas and put on a cowboy hate doesn’t make you country. Lyrics are shit too. Beautiful voice tho.
Is this the start of a new album or just a few new singles she's releasing? Beyhive megafans, I'm asking you....
This is Epic. This is super amazing. Cant wait to have the entire album.
❤
❤😊❤
I hope she makes country people mad like country is a black genre make your mark girl!
This is all I've ever wanted from her you guys don't understand how much this means to me
She's coming DIRECTLY to you now TAYLOR.. OOOP I gagged when I realized. She's here to GAG the girls ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ OOOOOOOOOOOOO
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝

🔥👑🐝💛
I love it❤
Come 👏 take 👏 it 👏 to 👏 the 👏 floor 👏 now 👏  🐎 🤠
It also explains the horse and hat in her tour. She was planning this next move then. While another artist was hinting, she was biting or copying their style she was planning her next boss move. Moved in silence hit it out the park.
Beyoncé doing her DAMN THING!! 😂😂😂
I'm rocking to this!!🎉 As usual she commands the charts and keeps us guessing like what's next??❤❤❤
Wat can I say nun Shit it’s Beyoncé All Hail Queen 🐝
Muito linda, rainha, não é atoa que Michael Jackson adorava essa mulher   😍
🤌😍
B come grace us at the Houston live stock rodeo . H town ❤❤❤❤
Beyonce ohhhhhhhhh B gee really Shake it up 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 The culture needed this to calm our souls 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
i love how you all say “oh this is good” “she’s trying new things” but you all are quick to read other artists that do the same. just because she’s beyonce she gets a pass and your previous statements don’t apply? it’s okay to say that this ain’t it 😂 fake asses
Beyonce pulled off Kanye’s look together so well. 👍
daddy lessons was only the beginning
This explains her meet up with Taylor a few months ago. Grammys better not cheat Beyonce in the country music category.
omg❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
I learned from the other video to watch to listen, not to see a music video. 😂
OMAYGHAD IS THIS
What can’t she do? Nothing.❤
Vc é tudo ❤
SLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Ugh everyone needs to bring awareness to the YouTube visual no one is checking for it
Try not to be urban, so she can win the Album of the Year  hahaha you b could  never with this trash
I love you B ❤
Even Beyonce has done country music before, it’s an even better to see her rejoin the genre along with K. Michelle & Monica!!!!!!
I’m here for it, Queen!!  Like if you’re here before 1M 🎉❤
Real Cuntry music is back!!
I love it! Been waiting for this! Didn’t think it would be B but I love it! ❤❤❤❤
H A R M O N I E S

Here before it goes number one on YouTube Trending
I give 10/10 for this because it’s a country song. 👍
The QUEEN strikes AGAIN 😮‍💨🫣🙌🏾🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

She taking it all back and it’s bout to have them shaking…I can’t wait. Reopen them doors for all them black country artist. I think she gonna tour at the sphere, smaller residency for this album do 3/4 night a week and have different black country artist open. After act 3 you get all the tour footage, and all the visuals and she gonna go somewhere and chill counting her coins.

No fucking way
She gone tie these hogs!
I can't wait...and I'm not even a country fan❤
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌🏾
I love that Beyonce does not stay stagnant. She is always evolving and only gets better with time. Artist that have been in the game as long as her might just live off the early success and just stay there but she keeps going even into other genres now. I am going to be loving this album. I do hope the third act is a rock album. Would love to hear that.
💓💓💓
She’s releasing new country music before Taylor Swift takes over and and continues to dominate the Billboard charts and mainstream media with her new April album release.   This explains why she’s lighten her skin to appeal to Euro audience. So superficial this woman is.
Love Beyoncé.  I definitely have to go to the black rodeo now
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am I the only one that’s hearing rumi at the end of the song?
Kudos to Beyonce trying new things and not afraid to try !!!
💥
welcome new era
i like this vibe better than the whole renaissance album 🎶
I really like the simplicity of the video and the country music with the Texas vibe 😊
Here at 50k views!
She's jumping genres and doing any and everything to compete with Taylor Swift
I love american folk music. Im incliding this to the category.
no soy fan del country, pero si Beyoncé decide darme country VOY DESAYUNAR, ALMORZAR Y CENAR COUNTRY
Lawd she won’t let me sleep 😂
She's really doing her best moment
Was never one to tune into country music but this got me moving my hips a lil
Lana’s impact.
Charlie Pride is smiling down right about now🙅🏽‍♂️
Dope Record❤❤❤I Cannot Wait To Hear The Rest of The Album💯👍#Yup
Let's go✨
JUST INCREDIBLE
Country music + Beyoncé’s vocals = Magic 🤠 ✨
Yyeeesss
I love it. Beyonce you can not do no wrong. When should I by my cowgirl hat for this album?
Yonce❤❤❤❤❤

The country music community is going to hate her

BOP
Beyonce entenda! Voce sempre fez tudo pelo Mundo. Obrigado pelo ACT II 💖😍🇧🇷
Country music😮 I’m here for it!  Let’s gooooo Queen🎉❤
Racist white people are about to have an aneurysm with this one
Suggar Mama abriu portas em outras eras
Its wild to me that TAYLOR SWIFT out here race baiting black women in real time to sell face wash and ANYONE is here talking trash about Beyoncé YET AGAIN putting us on to something that black people have deep roots in. SHIFT THE CONCERN 2024. Come at her for wearing Dolce and Gabanna during the RWT era. Come at her for not saying NON BINARY at the end of the RWT and still saying Male and Female alone. Come at her for doing this on KELLY BIRTHDAY. But any other argument DONT MAKE NO SENSE. Unless you just dont like the song. Which fine gurl ok lol.
This screams adel feature
She is a joke, what genre of music does she do. 😂😂😂
Country is my favorite genre but I swear she represent our culture #Zydeco
Need to see it so i can learn it😂
Beyoncé just doesn’t stop! She’s so amazing ❤️❤️
Perfeitaaaaa da nossa Bahia💙💙❤️❤️😍😍😍
You go gurl 🎉🎉  Moovin on to all country things 🎉🎉she's milking it  ❤
Absolutely love ❤❤❤
Vamos parar à internet ❤❤❤
Face, body, talent GOALS. ✨
IIIIIIIRAAAAAAAH 🐎

I honestly thought Act 2 of Renaissance was just stan conspiracy theories. This is wild.
😮❤❤❤❤❤
Beyonce know exactly what she's doing, trying to get that album of the year for the grammy's next year 🔥😮‍💨
Let's go Yonceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

I'm making me a mud slide tomorrow and smoking a cigar🤣.
What she’s doing is lead by example. Bringing brilliance and amazing artistry to everything she touches. The quality of what she’s putting out is always so inspiring. I can’t see any of the new artists (or older ones for that matter) getting close to her level.

I NEEDED COUNTRY BEY SO BAD OMG
This is a new energy for some of us but my first listening experience was fun 🙂. I found myself getting up and grooving a bit, then I wanted to do a bit more (dance wise), next the relief from not having to learn an entire 8 count and break out a sweat set in and it became fun again 😊. Easy going, not so intense. Nice Texas vibe for US. We needed this 🤎🤎🤎
MOTHER IS GENEROUS
This is so lovely ❤😍
Reputou
Hold on cowgirl
🥹🙌🏽🪩
Here!!❤
I said Self Titled was Beyonce establishing herself as her own genre and Lemonade was her doing every genre on one record. Now she's just showing off
She’s gonna reclaim the throne …
Not a great song
We love you Beyonce!!!! Was emo all day until your commercial and now this?! I think I’ll faint 🥵
As of today, I like country music 😅

Vem para o Brasil 🙏🏻🇧🇷
I just knew it! I love this! ♥️
I knew the country western outfit was for good reason😅
I think Beyoncé is giving a warning to America , that it’s about to be some type of showdown. Most will think she’s just attempting to do country but no I think she’s sending us a clear message.
Mesma vibe daqueles filmes onde a protagonista vai pro interior descobrir quem realmente é.
Im from California but this year. Im from fucking Texas!
I LIVE FOR THISSSSS
Oooo I actually really like this it’s nice little slow fun burn into the album 😍
💃🏽🔥
Omgah Beyoncé is going to kill me hahaha  I can’t take all this
Country music is just blues music set to a different beat & tempo
Ridiculous, she is not original🤷‍♂️

The take over ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I'm saving my money  for this concert  now!! I ain't miss a show yet
Me to the football game: SHHH!!!! Be quiet!!! WORLD STOP! BEY just dropped 😭🫶🏾🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS A HIT….I see em line dancin right now
this sh rock
I really hope this new musical project of hers centers the black/west African roots of country and bluegrass music, the black history of the banjo 🪕 and how it was a new world invention of the ancient west African instrument called the Kora (which the enslaved west Africans in the south created by hand and memory). I hope she explores all of that and more if this is indeed gonna be a country album. Country music started with black roots and there’s alot of esoteric wisdom, brilliance, ingenuity to be uncovered if she delves into the richness of its history. 🖤🩶
here for it…. loving this and to imagine you worked on this years ago and just releasing it

ANOTHER SONGGG
Screw it , I’ll say it: Beyoncé is the greatest artist alive right now. Swift, Mars, Gaga, Grande, etc., are all top tier, but none of them could hold a candle to Queen B, she’s in her own league. I dare to say, same level and historic importance for music as Elvis, Madonna, or Michael.
Beyonce in her country music era,im ascending ❤❤
It gives me church vibes. But I like it.
Queen B never disappoint us her Legacy will stay alive
❤❤❤
Album of the Year❤❤❤ QUEEENNNNN!!!!💅🏾😭😭😭💋💋❤
MOTHERRRRRRRRRRR!
Oh yes I like this!!! ❤
Calma aí, mamãe!!! Trabalhando no carnaval...

I love how she is touching her Texas Self. ❤

COME TO BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I'm loving her concept..reclaiming our music genres
Amazing 🇧🇷💕
Beyonce's country album will be a hit in Cracker Barrel's across America!
Singing a below mediocre song while your tits are out and everyone is saying its good? Im lost. Its terrible.

Tenho mais músicas favoritas dessa mulher
MDS BEYONCÉ MAS JA?????? VOCÊ VAI ABALAR O MUNDOOOO
Aaaaaah  Nem acredito, Beyoncé 😭😭🤧💕🫶🏾
Not B dropping this visuals and nothing for renaissance 😭😭😭😭
Ima be that POS comment that the HIVE comes for, but this sound aint the one for me. I can appreciate all genres of music, but country just irritates TF out of me. Banjo's make me cringe. Ya, I know I dont need to watch it if I dont like it, but I am a HUGE Bey Stan and while this song is no where near bad, I just aint having the country sounds. Pretty bad move IMO. The Queen was already put up against Swift, and this is just going to perpetuate that as Swift has her roots in country. It may be misconstrued as petty, vindictive, spiteful. Is Lana Del Rey's prophesy actually becoming true? I hold Bey high than christ, but I may have to skip this album if its country based. I guess she didnt learn from Daddy Lessons (If you know you know...I also had to make a country Daddy Lesson pun here because its likely the only time i can use it lmfao.
This is what an iconic legend does❤👏🏿❤👏🏿❤👏🏿
26.6 mil only 31 minutes on the platform always the queen breaking the internet always
Love country music ❤❤❤ I wasn't ready 😢🥹🥹🥹
I got my savings ready for Renaissance Act 2. Ohhh some bills gonna have to wait 😂
ate.
Yes ❤beyonce
EU TE AMO MAMMY
The repetition is actually quite genius
Does anybody wear clothes anymore??
Like this, your take on whatever you decide to take a take at is always yours. You can take a Houstonian out of Houston, but not the other way around. And that shows, in a good way.
I love it 😭😭
We got visuals😄
How are there more like than views?
Beyoncé is the best at anything she does ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great song!

MÊS QUE VEM EU TO NA VILLA MIX COM MINHA BOTA COUNTRY NO LIVE AT RODEIO DA BEYONCÉ
Ever since that Grammys outfit I had a feeling she was going to release something country. I have a theory that she's reclaiming genres that have historically been started or created by people of color and were taken or co-opted from us. First she released Renaissance, a love letter to house music, a genre pioneered by African American DJs and artists in 1980s Chicago like Crystal Waters, Cece Penniston and the Jungle Brothers. Now, she's taking back country
MAEEEEE OBRIGADA POR TUDO MAE 😭❤️🙏🏼🇧🇷

Voltando às suas raizes para construir o futuro com 2 musicas repletas do combo Beyoncé = Produção sonora, vocal e lirica a ponto de transcender. Alô galera de cowboy!
