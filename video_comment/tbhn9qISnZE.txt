Before you click too many weird links trying to find a cheap Golf, go to https://nordvpn.com/speeed and protect yourself!
But does a gli count 😂
Holds the mic like a nervous comedian. Still glad to see you’re  alive and well. 🫡
We love seeing this right after I bought a Golf TDI
I live in Wolfsburg, I’ve had enough of golfs
Guys  No place loves golf like South Africa.  I promise South Africa is the home of VW. Look in to it you won't believe how much VW is loved in SA
Brother, all you guys on VW Vortex helped my young dumb ass keep my 2000 audi a4 2.8 5-speed on the road and thriving back in the day. Thank you to anyone who contributed to keeping the dream alive.
Honestly how do I get those headlight caps? Do I make it or find it?
had a pretty fun Jetta for a while in my younger days. Swore i'd never subject myself to such plastic crap again in my life.
Wow! My first car in the states was the same Nissan 240SX too! I drove up to 200K miles before I sold it for a few hundred bucks.
Went and picked up a mk4 Tdi alh. Yeee yeee. Let’s get to wrenching.
Golf or jetta? and im over here with a Cabrio lol
Absolutely the truth.
Ive been looking to start my first ever project car. I like the 300zx, but ive jeard they are difficult. My other choice ive found is a 2008 VW Golf GTI.  He's asking $3909 and it appears clean. I want to do it, but i keed to learn
I wouldn't own a VW even if you paid me to
I have a mk2 golf project in my garage right now. Just pulled the transmission out and it’s been really fun working on it. And the body has basically no rust so I really lucked out.
Speaking of speed please do an episode on the movie "Legend of Speed" 16:45
3 minutes into the video, and I believe Volkswagen takeovers got those two events banned. Similar to how things are going on rn. But this time, they’re trying to ban us all.
I've been a mk3  enthusiast since before covid. ive rebuilt 2 I have an issue currently and that's finding an affordable cluster that WORKS!!!!!!!
Nice! I've always been a VW guy. My first car was suped up 79 Scirroco. Then a 96 VR6 Golf, then a 04 R32. My first job was at a VW dealership as well. When I had to get a real job, I got a diesel jetta for the gas mileage. I've had a Toyota Tacoma for a few years now, but I miss my old VWs.
James you should redo one of the greatest videos you ever made. The little trees video
That brown golf MK3 2:40 in on the front of pvw mag me and my mate chopped up just last year 👀🤣🤣 was in a very sorry state!
That brown golf MK3 that was on the pvw mag with the cream interior me and my mate chopped up just last year 👀🤣🤣🤣
Just pulled a 2002 GTI out of the PA woods that looked very closely like my 1st car to resurrect. Let’s hang out
Ive owned 3 mk3 jetta/golfs and beat the absolute dogshit out of every single one. They just do things that they shouldnt.
i got Golf mk1 Citi  from south africa  , they kept building mark1s up to 2009 , new trims, engines but the same car called Citi  and its different models like citirox velociti etc etc
So this means L'oe Show next year? Got plenty of time...
Golfs are NOT cheap in Brazil 💔 The mk4.5 sportline is my dream car though
While I'd jump on the VW Golf bandwagon; but, there is one problem..... PRICE!! To get a decent 5spd 2.0L Golf in my area, one would have to fork out $10K plus for a high mileage car who's upkeep is sketchy at best. Many of video on here s portray VW Golfs (Mk 2 to Mk 4) good condition models being $3K to $4K. The cheapest in my immediate area is a 2003 model with a 5spd  and miles in the 150K to 200K with more body rust than an old worn out farm truck. As such: I'll be sticking to my Fiesta SE for now.
already wrong in the first minute, the best project car bang for your buck wise, is a 2014-2018 mazda 3
and the smoke in that shop is still hanging around to this day!
Mk1 or Mk2  are the only options imo
I bought my Golf 4 for a little over a 1000 euros. Turns out my rims are r32's. Looks awesome and apparantly worth more then i paid for the entire car.
Do you know what’s a cool Golf? 2014 Skoda Octavia VRS wagen.
Hello, greetings from Mexico. Let me tell you something about the Golf GTI here. They're such a common car that if you own one, you can find a ton of aftermarket parts. As we say in Mexico, you can find parts 'at the pharmacy.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOI
I got my  1985 Golf mk2 GTI 8v last week. So much work ahead but its going to be fun!
When i see the way you spell speeed i hear a 2 sysable word like Spe- eed!
Like a fancy Vega!!
Yep had the 1.8 turbo passat the LUXURY jetta
Bought myself a mk5 Golf thanks to James:)
I love the feel of a VW and they certainly have the driving experience down. I just wish reliability weren't such an issue otherwise I would be all for them.
Ugh…..I was all set to build an 06 RX8. But you’re back to my Vdub days. First car was a 67 bug. Then a 79 rabbit Mk one GTI then a Mk 3 GTI. So confused now.
When he says "idc what some bald guy says, it does matter what girls like"  I felt that
The dub life is the only life.  Picking up another mk2 gti in the morning 🫡 its a shell blank canvas ❤
Your content is a lot better without those donut kikes in the way.
James I'm pretty sure I owe it to you I bought a mk6 GTI for my first fun car. I love this thing too. It looks good sitting still and feels fun to rip and drive.
And we never saw this car again.
Bought an Oryx White 6MT MK7 Golf R last weekend. 😊 sincerely another dude that used to live in Kentucky.
the 2.5L engines are no joke, I have one with 30k miles and Its gonna live to see 300k miles easily.
Instructions unclear bought a porsche
I've already been thinking about buying a cheap golf to project. This video popped up at the perfect time lol.
I spotted a 2.5 engine for $250
3:46 .....emmmm....i think the girls sitting on a AudiA4B6, not on a VW.😂😂😂😂
james can we still hang out even if i dont own a golf
this man's style in cars and clothing gotta be researched and documented
I have a Mark V and i love it! But try to find a Mark3 even.....None on Autotempest, i found a couple on Bring a trailer, and they want way to much for a project car. None on Market place in my neck of the woods either.
Golfs and Civics back in my day were the premier tuner car for broke kids.
2 Things:  1) as a 30 year old carpenter, i am JUST starting to get into cars. Speeed IS my intro into the automotive world.  2) Seeing you wear a Medium Build hat solidified my choice @11:15 of my "favorite car youtube channel". Hell yeah man. Aloha
✨commuinity✨
i have a mk4 2.0 golf with a butt (jetta) & it has been a trying 5 1/2 years but i love it 🥲
Discord ?
I really wanna know what James, as a Volkswagen enthusiast, thinks of PA Dubbers
MK3 Vr6 is a GOAT car/ In the 90s VW Golf/GTI/Jetta fit and finish was superior to everything in the class.  I think when people sit in a Subaru, Toyota, Honda sports hatch etc now they should appreciate that VW raised the whole game for everyone.
Speeed is better than donut 😎
I love ur videos and im a VW junky my next build is a mk4 golf with a 07k swap and a dsg
my parents wont care if i got a old car, my dad drives a vw golf 2 16v and has owned multiple mk1's in his life, my mom also loves older cars xd
I would save that car because it carries history behind it
I know im late but what if i want JDM, are those old civic hatchbacks as cheap and easy to mod as a beginner?
wont like em.
5:39 - Can we talk about what it takes to set up a whiteboard list that you can pull tape off of without destroying what's written underneath?   How does that work?
My first car is a 2007 mk 4 golf, Canada kept producing them until around 2010 and they looked weird, but only the 2007 model looked exactly like the mk4 golf.  I’ve never had a project car, and it’s in good condition, but I’d like to try modifying it, maybe a car back and high flow cat, some alloy wheels, maybe nos, one day maybe a turbo kit
Speeed community, I’m looking at a 1999 GTI 2.0T NA Automatic Transmission for $2500.  Can’t find a reasonable working manual in the area.  Should I settle for this automatic and do mods to this one?  I also just need a daily driver, my Mazda crapped out a while ago. (Fresh into cars so apologies if I butchered anything)
I don't want a Golf, I want a Gol Bolinha Ap 1.6 from 95
0:00 7 years ago. I've known you for seven years. This is some parasocial relationship I've got going on...
how can anything to do with nord be risk free when they have already had at least one security breech and data leak.
Bro im sorry but volkswagen are the wrost car to work on... just buy a mazda 3 they are cheap
3:22 James, I knew you lived in Ky, but you went to Trinity!? I spent my four years at Trinity watching your content and just now find that out, years later. wild
hey technically a Porsche is a Volkswagen lol
H20 show didn't get banned from OCMD .... That was the idiots on the strip , it was well documented that the two were not connected!
I got a mk4 tdi golf and I love it i would love to go to a meet when im done building it but that might be a while lol
just bought myself a 2001 polo wish me luck 😭
Used to have a Golf Mark 3 estate manual. One of the best cars I ever had
"Let me tell you a story" Wait wait wait! *pauses*  Let me go pee, grab a snack, my favorite blanket, turn down the lights.  Okay. Go on 😊
Rip H2oi
What wheels are those
you mentioning vwvortex just brought me back to 2013. was looking for my golf and i found that forum. miss my golf everyday
I love vw I've had a 85, 95, and 2000 Jetta and they were my most favorite cars I've owned
I bought myself a MK3 Golf of '95, tdi, nothing fancy as speed if we talking, and currently destroyed both interior and exterior. I'm restoring it, little by little, and it's one of the most satisfying things i've ever done in my life. This weekend was the rooftop, it was falling down. 30€ have the guilt of repairing it, and it looks amazing.
I would prefer to find my 1st car 1989 fox 2 door wagon and build make it look nice
I enjoy the way you tie in personal stories and express how cars can connect to emotions and personal history, something that is usually overlooked on youtube when talking about cars
Ok make a video of possible internal upgrades of the engine. Such as cams,pistons,connecting rods etc
Had a buddy in 2007 highschool who had a Jetta GTI, fell in love with German engineering, joined the Air Force, got to go to Germany, actually went to the BMW Building 2011 in Köln (Cologne) Germany. I like what you're doing guys!
Gay intentions
I’m in
every time i see my car and its problems i think about this car, this video and the next one, i own a first gen honda prelude, i know i know, it is not the best platform in the world, but i have sentimental attachment to this car, i bought it in buenos aires argentina and i drove it to rio de janeiro which is my home today, my car is rare here in brazil, you guys at speeed are motivating me to sell it and buy a golf here in brazil which makes a lot of sense because VW brazil is.. well you know... if anyone sees this message and is interested in the story i can tell you in detail what happened, if not a simple answer will do... should i sell my 43 year old japanese car and buy a golf, or should i suck it up keep it and save up for a cheap golf here in brazil?
my dream car was and always was the 2001 vr6 jetta wagon and 3 years ago i finally found one i was there to get an Audi he had but seen the wagon under wraps and asked to take a peak once i seen her i knew my dream had no longer been a dream there she was becky my new to me vr6 wagon she is blonde and the rest i history that car is a beast and i wouldn't trade it for anything to be clear my fincee family has tried to take me to buy me a car they are very well off but they just dont understand all except one guy who is also a vw fanatic he gets it and saved me i wouldnt have sold it ever but i consider parking it but its hard not to drive her
sry but the blue and pink  jp performance mk3 has nothing to do with a replicate of ur car its a tubeframed mk3 with a complete r8 chassie under the body. no hate love ur car just saying
Thats my motor!
rather do a f30 build, they are sub 10k
No project car is ever finished
H20 still in Md in ocean city
The best bang for the buck is the Mazdaspeed 3. Smoke 90% of people stock.
VR6 miata would be a good fit
bro I would hang with u any time, but a golf project? u wildin
I already have two too many Honda projects...
james i need you to give your opinion on the vw eos
James I did it on accident I got a 700 dollar mk3
my guys on ozempic?
I’m personally super good on not getting one of these, but my best friend just bought a 2013 golf and it’s pretty cool. Not my flavor but I do like the car. BUT! Glad to see you again and you’re lookin good man. Keep it up and I subbed to the new channel 🤙
Timeless. I agree.
I feel like if the OG donut team came together and rebranded themselves, it would go crazy
I think I saw you in a Trinity t shirt when you lived in Louisville.  So, you didn’t pass the entrance exam for St. X ?
8:37 “Commuinity” lol
man i sold my 58 rag top bug totally  restored ans got my first 95 vw golf .... looking back   im a dumbass
Dude the obi-one carnobi had me rolling how do you come up with all this love ittt! ❤😂
No the best and cheapest car is and will always be a Honda
14:49 took me out
I KNEW YOU WERE FROM KENTUCKY!!!!!! FUCK YEAHHH. Others think of Kentuckians as rednecks or hillbillies and sure there are some but that's not the entire state. hopefully you'll change a lot of outlooks on people like us.
There is no better duo. I love James. Donut should never have let him go. This guy is a creative genius and the people he surround himself with make amazing things happen. I look forward to speed becoming a huge ginormous channel.
Newer to the channel and I'm loving all of the VW content! I've been kicking myself for selling my '02 Jetta when didn't have a job to pay to fix it anymore. I'm getting the itch to have a fun/cool car again.
Nord VPN is obviously comprised Lol
My buddy has a mk4 337 edition custom stitch interior big turbo gti holy shit it’s such a fun car it’s his project love that car
i need you to yap about them i just got a 1999.5 gti mk4 vr6 glx (first car)
🇮🇳
i got myself a VW Jetta3 about a year ago. it cost about 500$ or R15000, i had to spend another lot of bucs to make it run good but i'm enjoying the old car. south africa
MK3 Golf is my favorite too. Back in 2011 to 2015 i had one, a miss that car so bad
Super stoked to see you got her back! I currently got an 09 honda fit as my project car thanks for inspiring hope to show ya one day🤘🔥
Your right. Back in the day it used to euro vs imports vs domestic. Now it's just imports and domestic. Euro turners are dead compared to back in the day.
you make me miss my old golf 3 that was slammed on 20" - had so much fun in that car :)
that same car in malaysia where i live can cost you 10k usd 🗿
Miata Nb is the best project car
i just bought a mk6 gti and the amount of people i’ve had come up to me to talk about it or try to race in my small town is crazyyy… i barely got a second glance with my old, lowered 05’ magnum rt… somehow lol
Bruh this nostalgia made me tear up.  2 corrados, jetta and gti in my late teens and early 20s.  All vr6.  Upgraded to a b5S4 and drove it 13 years to 200k miles.  Recently sold it and never thought I’d miss the Vs and ✌️from the bros as kids half my age nearly as much as I do 👍🤪
Don’t do this james, this was my 18-21 and now you’re letting the world know the last cool tuner is the only one I know well. Those Geiger lights man 🙃 go bauser hood and euro bumpers bruh
I bought a 2012 JSW TDI just so I could have a cheap beater burner car and not put miles on my trucks, but damnit if I didn’t fall in love with it and am currently hitting a pothole and now building it 😅
I thought James owned Donut.  So who owns Donut?
i’ve had a mk6 and mk7 and they have been my favorite cars by far!
Funny, German numberplate of Karlsruhe. Didn't know that this car is from my town XD
Going on Facebook Martinplace now
Taking back Sunday mention🤘🏼
My first 3 cars were all Jettas!  a MkII, MkIII, and MkIV GLI, some of my best memories were driving/breaking/fixing those cars.  I should buy one for a project....
Anyone else remember Krispys H2o after movies?
Show us your wife
My second car was a 2001 Golf Mk4 in Blue. At the time, I wasn't big on doing upgrades as I was a broke kid, but I still reminisce to this day about it. It was a FUN car to drive.
I just got a 1999 vw golf gti 👀👀
The mk3 looks just a lil too "bubbley" for me. The mk2 is just so. . .  Angular. I love it.
Commuinity
Miata PART 2
Does your mic say Donut?
Im glad you got it back. Ill always miss my first car. It sold again and my ex friend rubbed it in my face... so im living vicariously through this. Im happy you got it.
I got a Silver Alert right after the moment he showed off his age and thought he edited it in 🤣🤣🤣
my first car is a golf 2 its a project car too re made 20% of the bodywork and cleaned it up its getting painted mat black now with a thick bumper
i already have a golf prodject golf 2 prodject 20% of the body got replaced and now its getting painted
Might as well....get MO power!
blank H feature nice
My name is James, I live in Louisville ky, and my first car was a s13 coupe not hatch......small world
I live in east EU, i don't need to see more Golf 3 projects....
@2.51 that blue mk3 golf belonged to / was built by a friend of mine
I just bought a 1974 Mercedes 450sel as a project car though :(
Sorry but that Golf sucks!  The E30 is cool though.
Step 1: buy golf Step 2: buy 1.9 TDI and huge turbo kit Step 3: figure out how to do bypass anti lag Step 4: have a fuckin blast
Most importantly.... the "Pop up, up and down headlights!" song is yours right?
Nerd alert comment: I would love to know what % of viewers watched the whole Nord VPN ad -- I did, and I ALWAYS fast-forward through ads. That is a level of 'engagement' that advertisers have nocturnal emissions about, btw..
my first project is the 73 mach 1 i just bought for a band, can i get some help getting it running again
3:05 Ocean City, MD....
If anyone wants to import a car from Germany look at the local climate it's coming from. Despite its relatively small size Germany's climate in winter varies a lot and thus the amount of salt the cars are exposed to. Also city cars are usually less rusty. The best would probably from the Cologne area. Very little frost and very very rare snow events. In urban areas even less so.
If it has 4wd or a G-Lader in the description - consider how likely your kid was really gonna graduate anyway..  Edit: Golf wearing BBS will always be solid.
07Ks are unfortunately not so common on Europe.
LETT’ssssss GOOOOO!!!!!!
Dude. H2O and HSE rover wheels. Add air ride . Man the dayzzz
Yeah sorry I just bought a Opel Omega A. Next time it mighg be a Golf
Rewatching this after I just bought an Mk3 Golf for 850 euros and I feel like I'm getting sucked into the VW community.
VW in Brazil is huge! they have a 90's Gol Gti. You should go out there and bring one 🙌🏽
Dummy eye lens for a air intake please
Crazy to have side car money.
I bought a 03 jetta 1.8 turbocharge back in the day because I wanted to mimic the fast and furious jetta. best decision I made,  I had it for about 12 years put about 200K miles on it and I still got $6K for it when I sold it. It was fun to drive.
I’d get one if it wasn’t front wheel drive
LOVE my mk5 Jetta. That 5cyl when modded is NO joke
Love that his edits are old school clips and footages of him flipping through his own magazines lol
Hi James, I have a VW Vento, thats what a Jetta MK3 is called here in the netherlands. And I love this car!! Parts are "cheap" and its almost all DIY to repair. Not having that much of rust but the rear fenders need to be threated at some point. It's low, has white 17" Azev A wheels, recaro interior (fabric needs repair), a Rieger splitter, and same headlights as your Golf. Its a real head turner painted in matt army green. Only down side is the 1.8 engine, its freaking slow... Plan is to put a 5 cilinder or, VR6 in it. But these vr6 engines are so expensive right now, a 5 cilinder is available for $500 and you get a car with it. Anyway, i'm stoked to see these series of your car so you got a new follower ;)
Would you do something similar to bumper 2 bumper?
They are theee best car hand down I still miss mine
I love my mk3 convertible so much. They're dirt cheap here in germany. Vw let Karman build those. Mine even got a little bit upgraded by Max Moritz and I still payed under 2000$ Now I have a video to showto  my friends who don't get why I love those!  Thank you! Also you got some sick parts. The wheel and the extra lights alone are dope! Looking for those lights for a while now!
In 2004, I fell in love with the GTI, but it was just out of reach. I dove into communities (eventually stumbling on to VWVortex, I just lurked, not participating much).  During the following years, I decided the car I would work towards would be the Golf R. In 2016 (on my birthday), it happened: I bought a 2012 R. 9 years later, it's still my favorite car I've ever owned. While it already has a stage 2 tune, you now have me thinking about an 07k swap and turbo/tune. 😂
Those were some hot chicks in that old clip
Golfs are over rated, bang for buck is an Alfa Romeo 147 GTA, with an Italian V6 Busso engine.
*Excluding the MK4 community 😂 -ex MK4 GLI owner
I heavily relate to this because my 2004 facelift Maruti Zen is at a bodyshop because of rust and i blew my 2010 Mitsubishi Cedia's engine (conrod tore out of the block). And i havent been able to pay for them just yet and i cry everyday worrying if i will ever get them out of the hell that is a mechanic's waiting area.
What's your discord?
Holy crap I missed the new channel!! Was just wondering what happened to this legend
You don't mention the 1.8t swap specifically? It can nevar lose!
We're going to see a video soon from Donut titled "We got out microphone back from Speeed"
This rust looks scarier than the MCM Daihatsu had before it needed an acid bath for 2 weeks.
VW should ditch the name “Jetta” and just go with Golf with a butt, lol
0:23 imagine if you slipped. You could have died there mate :(
As a Jdm car guy from MD. H2oi was a crazy time. James is crazy spot on
8:27 @speeedco stoked you love our VAGAS 3D rendered MK1 golf! @gavh84
It works, I have now seen 3 buy adds for mk3s here in Sweden.
Taking back sunday mentioned!!
Imma ruin whoever sees this whole day. Next time you get a chance look at the side of your car from a good distance away and pay attention to the rear wheels being slightly off centre the the wheel well it self:)
First car I bought was a mk3 gti. Wish I would have kept it
bro im burning to see a spotlight for the VR5. Thats the one thats very slept on and sadly didn't go to the states
Do a bigtime vs speed build contest
so glad u metiond jetta. i have a jetta mk2. and now i feel a part of the coool club:) love ur vid btw, keep it up
you have to come to Argentina, here the VW Gol, Golf and Ventos have a HUGE Scene
I guess I can hang out with Y'all. I do drive the ugly duckling New Beetle, but I make up for it by chiptuning the crap out of it, and I drive it like I stole it..
when i first saw this 4 mo ago. i’ve been watching ad listings everyday to find something i like and can afford. so today i honestly just bought a wolfsburg mk4 jetta.. and that thing is NASTY! sounds so mean!
Always been a golf fan. I’m tryna get a MK5
I would vote for a 2.8 VR6.  600bhp using stock internals, what's not to love?
My dad owned a mk1 golf a long time ago. I think he blew up his engine and sold it. We all regret it now 😅
vwvortex and car forums in general were so much cooler 20 years ago.
I’ve had the 2l 8v, the 2l 16v and the VR6 highline. Absolute awesome cars!
Just learned why I haven’t seen you on donut im soo late im sorryyyyy James here now💪 ready for buff horses baby!!!!
VWs are cool, but 20+ year old AMGs are kino. Stupid power and luxury for the money, great OEM wheel choices, and honestly not that hard to maintain as long as you're not getting into the old diesels with vacuum controlled shifters. If you're buying old german cars, might as well feel like you're into organized crime while you're at it.
LOVE my mk4 golf. Its not fast but its comfy and looks hella nice. Its my daily and my current project <3
I'm constantly driven by "might as well" situations when it comes to my old cars 😂
My first car was a 1993 mk3 GTI 2.0 8v after two blowen trans i parked it and i walk by it every day
I don't have a golf, best I can do is a jetta 🤷🏻‍♂️
Funny how we get sentimentally attached to things, like cars. I've owned a 2005 MINI from new and won't ever part with it (much to my wife's chagrin). It's been a 20-year project!
U still have like 3 cars u need back IMO
My 2004 jetta 1.8t was one of the fastest in Glen Burnie. Also had a driver mod. 😂😂 but no lie I loved my jetta. Won 1st place in some car shows in ocean city and H2O was the best show ever. Until it got shut down and the cops there were towing cars for even having wheels on them. Great times. Vr6 turbo is one of the best cars of all time and one of the fastest. Love them.
Hell yeah! I am still driving my Mk5 GTI and my Mk6 R every single day! So many friends and such a supportive community. VWs forever ❤
Brooooo its a great video BUT it is pronounced „FOLKSWagen“ like folk music. The V is like a F in german brooooo
I paid £400 for mine
VW content? Book club? I guess I should’ve been following post-Donut departure 🔥
Not one “Mo Power Baby!” Disappointing.
Im sure JP performance didn't replicate your car bro, but still they do look very similar I'll give you that. I'm sure you know all the details about the  Golf 3 R8 V10 already
Im a bug guy here in denver, maybe we can still go for a cruise one day
Hot hatches have always been awesome. I would absolutely have one if i didnt need a truck for homesteading. Cant even get out to my trailer in a sedan. Even in a hatchback, it'd be dicey if you could do it.
Got a seat Leon topsport. Same thing as a golf 4 gti. Those cars are amazing for tuning
The worst part about choosing the golf that has your project card is the parts. Volkswagens oem parts are expensive.
Love my MK7 wagen, it's tuned and has some bolt ons.
Listen... the Golf MK2 is my absolute fav and know it's worth the effort regardless of the age
My first car was a mk3 bro!
VW and Honda
bro, being featured in PVW for me was the ultimate achievement. I remember grabbing all 12 copies from local chapters when it came out. My first VW was mk3 Golf CL, and vortex was a home. Seeing your checkered hood, with passanger mirror delete kinda rings a bell too. MK3 sections was dope. I have a 74 Dasher now, that has been tucked in the garage for nearly a decade now. I gotta bring it out.
I love my '03 Jetta Wagon
Let’s allllll support James, MO POWA BABY
8:24 wtffff!!!! im cryinggg i take this picturee!! purple mk1 turkish plate golf!!! thank you my best maaan!! i love you <33
Have one jetta
If I got a golf it wouldn’t be a golf, but basically a golf😭, I’d probably get a 98 Volkswagen r32, I LOVE the way they look, they’re just BARELY different from the golf but the small difference just pull the look together for me
bro im not sure if you've made this vid already but as someone who's just getting into cars, i would love a video on basic modifications that can be done out the gate to improve engine sound/performance and overall aesthetics not just street cars but even suv and pickups
If you want find great VW golf from europe, write me. I work in VW industry
I've been modding my MK7 Golf Sportwagen 5-speed manual, 240 HP. Am I still cool? Because, it's a wagon, but it's a 5-speed with decent HP.
Is James driving a G Wagon on the way to the shop?
53 seconds in and you already convinced me to buy a golf
Selling my 08 rabbit was a big mistake
I remember seeing neuspeed stickers on  a ton of VWs between 1995-2005z
Good video but no matter what James says or how big and popular they get I will never think vws are cool I don’t think any of them look good but to each their own just not a fan.
The Mk3 Golf will ALWAYS have a special place in my heart (as it will in the hearts of many others). I've had 3 of those so far, and all 3 got sold due to me being a poor-ass student, not being able to afford anything if it meant it can't be fixed with my 2 hands and googling the problem.   That being said, all three were 1.8 gasolines with 89 horsepowers, the last one got tuned with a boatload of stuff from a friend of mine, like a sport air filter, cooler exhaust, and due to the heating element going out (yes, the one under the instrument panel), it took me 4 days to pull that out and reinstall everything, but I used the time to spray paint everytning in the car's colour (which was that cool metallic green). Couple that with some aluminium 17" wheels, a barn find of VR6 interior in leather, and that thing was BITCHIN!   My God, did Iove that car. I put some 80.000 km on it and sold it with 310.000 km on the odometer. Turns out a girl who was studying to be a mechanic got it. I met her some 5 years after that, and she still drove it, she was just shy of 400.000 km total with it.
Where did the coloured taillights go?
I got a 07 rabbit that's is so fun to drive
That’s interesting you bringing up the “car scene” cuz it us 😊 and the new friends you make along the way. It’s like high school , people quickly attache to a “group” aka car nerds. We are different, but we are all nerds. Rise together!
Bruh, the amount of smoke in that garage at the end, lol. Hella jazzed that you get to keep her. Making me wanna go v-dub now. Just keep regular content on the build coming. I'm here for it.
Just found your channel and wow, your life was a lot like mine. Growing up listening to taking back Sunday and brand new in my MK4 indigo blue GTI
My uncle had a black mk3 GTI and i remember that car sitting on his yard  not running until one day it disappeared. When i grew up and realized what that car really was i asked about it to buy it for me but he sold it a few years back for under a 1000 euros. Its still my dream to find a clean mk2 or mk3 golf due to this car...
Don't have a golf but love my mk4 wagon
Yea that’s how I feel about my 79 Foxbody…. And the motor lost compression…. And has been sitting in a literal barn for almost a year now.  But I’m waiting for a trade to go through on my 07 sts lux 3 performance pkg on a modified 99 mustang. Probably will drive the 99 as an alternative show car until the fall then will swap the whole drive line and interior into the Foxbody. And it will slay. And then I have a parts car for my Mach 1!
I would love to hang out but you won't find me buying a VW anything lol.
reecently had to retire and neglect my daily driver mk3 golf cabrio diesel. might just project car my baby
So do you get to keep your trade mark sayings, like “More Power Baby!”
I’m building a MK2 Golf with a 07k swap need the swap kit so I can start plumbing it into the car! I’m getting more stoked everyday.
So THAT'S how the word car came about! TIL
H20 was wild
I want to make a 2016 Jetta into a rs3
watched this video then went to buy a blown up e46 and m54b30zhp swapped it lol
Dope! This vid’s perfect for me cause my daily is a golf AND I have a golf project lol
I have a MK3 Audi TT can I join your club? Basically just a Golf...kinda
Ive been looking at a sportwagon to get wanna find one w a standard
I had DP5 wheels on my 86 mk2.  Heavy as hell but man they looked good.  I also found out what hubcentric means.  That what those Rotiforms are a copy of.
I have a mk7 gti and a mk3.5 cabrio. Love them both
I miss my mk4’s. I’m looking for anything VW around Fresno,CA but no luck. I might just get an 01 Passat and be happy to be in a VW.
Dude I love your humor on these videos. Excited for more of Speeed!
Proud of you James. Please keep it up.
Me stoked to announce this video inspired my partner and me to get a mk6. My bank account and garage aren’t as stoked
Sold my mk4 for like 2k a few years back.  Oh how times have changed
pretty sure I saw this in new york being towed  its a joke btw
As sweet as the Golf is, I would have argue that the DC5/Integra/RSX is an even better option for a cheap project car.  It had the most aftermarket support of any car when it came out, and those parts are still out there, sometimes for cheap too.
Best sounding GTI I’ve heard. Incredible
I’ll have to remember the “Might as well” dogma for the future
I got unreasonably happy when the car could be recovered.
Just had to explain the, might as well, to my wife the other day.  If I blow up the engine in my mk7 and need a rebuild I 'might as well' upgrade all of the internals and go at least stage 2
As a GTI owner, I agree
Sorry i already got my Scion frs project car that i bought EIGHT years ago lol can't think of anything i didn't touch on that thing, basically only the inside of the engine i haven't personally touched. Yet. I also have a turbo and will eventually build the engine for more power. And I'm looking at getting a Harley Davidson Nightster 975 right now. I already have a Kawasaki and a Yamaha, and will eventually own a bike from each of the big 4 in Japan lol just taking a little detour real quick
In Vice Grip Garage terms it’s called a “Mosle” (mah-zel). “Might as well!”
I need a friend like castro in my life
I'm oblivious to the car lingo—but this is a fun watch. Even started checking out some golfs ;)
I just got my first car a couple months ago. It is a mk4 vw golf estate from 2004. It has zero rust which is rare for the mk4. It's a 1.6, which over here in the uk is pretty big for a first car. And I have more than double the powa than my friends have in there 2010 polo's and corsas. It is super fun, and brings back lots of memories, as my parent had a red mk4 golf estate when I was young.  And yes it absolutely will be my project car. It will not stay stock for long.
The "might as well" and "Well While Im Here" are my favorites and wallets least favorites.
VW. Not sure if car fixed itself or check engine light also broke.
Does anyone have any personal experiences to share about Castro's motorsports..?
Old model car still best
Thanks for this! Bringing back great memories!!
Remember, when VW stuck W12 engine intoo GOLF? Golf GTI W12  got me hypnotised to YouTube back in 2007 :D Good times. Would love to see some sick MANIAC making W12 golf replica in his garage ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I've never loved a car like my mk7.5. Will drive it till the wheels fall of. I dream of restoring and modernizing a mk1 some day
If you’re looking for a custom interior hit up nw crafted over here in Washington! Big time VW Audi enthusiasts that do insane quality custom interior work.
dudes guna almost cry every time hes on camera talking about a car
I love these but it has to be hilarious to have your "old golf" be so famous :)
So I just bought a Volkswagen Golf and I can say it's all thanks to James and this video! 🙌😂
If you're happy James.
I just bought a 2006 volkswagen golf it is a  base model but its fun to drive even tho it doesnt have alot of power
👍
See James back to the "HiLow" kind of videos, makes me so happy, missing his jokes around, you're awesome man!
Why did VW owners did all those cool things to their cars? Because the car is incredibly boring otherwise.
What if it has a trunk?
mk3 being called old made me realise i am getting old as well.  that and my back lmao.
3:46 is soooo true hahaha. I drove a 1988 Toyota Tercel DX wagon in high school and during the first 2 years of college. The girl I was dating at the time was embarrassed to be in that thing because it was loud and falling apart. I remember a time that I took her to a drive-thru, and the fast food employee asked me to turn off my car because they couldn't hear me. The muffler had rusted off and is gone with the wind.  Now, I drive a 2024 Toyota GR Corolla. Women think that it's cute or that it's a practical car. Either way, I win. I still miss that Tercel, though...
Rocket Wax owner GTI_LVR was on VWVortex!
Watching this video brought me so much joy. I'm in my early 40s and VWs, and the scene was and is still such a big part of my life and some of my closest friends. Thank you for your part in keeping the scene alive!
I always loved the look of the VW Rabbit over the Golf, and I think it came in so many configurations, even a mini-pickup. I want to know why the Golf is so much more iconic than the Rabbit
16:47 whistle to 'young folks' by bjorn
I remember being part of the last crowd of southern worthersee in Helen, GA before the city shut it down for too many shenanigans
You could say that he got his son back.
When you're done with it, you should see if you can get with Sarah~n~tuned and have her bring her Audi out.
Awww man!!!! I sold my MK4 GTI Turbo last week Friday. I was already missing it and this episode is making me miss it even more. Seriously thinking of buying me another Golf
just got a mk5 gti and im loving it
First car for me was a 1966 vw bug  Second car 1991 Golf GTI Third 2011 Mazdaspeed 3 Four 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 Sorry James no Golf for me. Speeds are way more affordable
since birth and until I got my license I was riding in my dads mk4 golf vr6 and now its mine. love it
Holey shit,,,,  I have to say first that I love your channel but this was a waste of time I want more car and less talk wow.....WOW
I miss the prime era of H2Oi
WHOOOO is the bald red guy????
What part of Kentucky you from? I've lived in Kentucky my whole life
no offence to donut but I really only watched them for you so like, this is the new donut
I watched this video and then bought an 03 golf tdi within 2 hours
I used to be into cars heavy in my early 20s and I want to get back into it but I don't know where to start. Any suggestion?
It would look better with white wheels
VW Vortex, Club GTI and Edition 38 were the go to places for all VW knowledge. I've been part of the VW scene for 20+ years. And, my mk2 GTI still sits in my garage and ironically enough runs the mk3 GTI (ABF) engine.
I had one of these. mk3 GTI. lowered to all hell. Cool ride!
ah yes the "might as well" a staple favorite among car enthusiasts!
*Top Gear magazine was named after the show not the other way around.
i like how some golfs look, the R32 VR6 awd was something i always interested in, I briefly looked at VW for AWD but ended up getting several 2004 wrx wagons. how is the FWD on these golfs?
This video convinced me to pick up a Mk5 Golf
Bring da pawar
I have a similar story with the Mk1 Focus.
I just got a mk4
They're not popular anymore because they don't last and are more work than it's worth to keep them running. Every VW guy I know in my area has had oil consumption issues which end up totalling the engine and they moved on to another brand entirely.
i absolutely agree with you. i love my tsi mk5 gti. got over 220k miles on it and its been tuned over 200k of them. im gonna cry when she gets retired.
This is motivating me to finish my mk3 jetta vr6 and my corrado build, thanks james
I already have 4 projects atm otherwise a golf would be sick
😅 h20...fun times
Unfortunately in the northeast they're all rotted to nothing 😢 (the mk3 and mk4s) which is what I really want
I don’t think it’s anything special but I have a 2006 Volkswagen Jetta with a four-cylinder turbo charged diesel. But, it has a broken, fly wheel Broken EGR cooler A cracked windshield broken air conditioning and a leak in the turbo. And a lot of dents. It needs a lot of work, but I love the little car ❤️
I have a MK7 as my daily currently, I love that car so much.  Honestly probably a better choice for me personally as my first car. *It was that or a Kia Forte or Nissan Sentra SR*
James genuinely looks like an American David Beckham
Brooooo..   I was at Many of the H20i shows... they were fucking WILD times man. i have sooo many storys.
Harlequin paint job. Full stop.
Hey dude, I had mk3 GtI ABA im possibly getting back, currently have a 87 civic hatch. My favorite cars on earth, I’m in socal let me know if you wanna hangout and shoot the shit
Man I wish, Speeed and Big Time would collab! Or maybe merge? Just call it Big Time Speeed! Great to see them boys altogether again! Let’s get 1M likes and they will make it happen ❤ pleaaaaseeee 🙏
I'd rather get a motorcycle and I will not travel into California.
14:50  Please don't use garbage AI images.
what mic does he use ? (i feel like he already mentioned it in a video before and gave like ebay link but i forgot which video was it)
Where’s that discord
I have a mk6 gti can we be friends?
You've convinced me
I bought an 2017 gti in June last year from a dealership,  by September of the same year the proformance clutch pushed out the thrust bearings. Now the dealer and warranty company won't do anything about it.
Oooof, I’m startin to get the mk2 blues… I miss my old VWs. This gives me such a flood of nostalgia. I still have such a soft spot for mk1-mk3 Volkswagens.
So glad you’re off doing your own thing, how you want to do it!
Love you James. A lot of us admire your decision to go on your own and stay true to yourself. Great role model
i have a corrado with a vr6 i want to fix up so bad !!!!
THAT RUST AINT NOTHING
Way back when I had my VR6, an guy came up to me out of nowhere. He said, "I once had a VR6, I still miss it. Best car I ever owned"
I got a golf 3 for 500€ in Romania, thing is the car has a lot of problems, has a 1.4 litre engine and i cant afford to tune it😢
I just turned 50 and you made me sell my respectable suv to buy a new GLI.  Funny thing is my wife didn't get mad. She wants to sell her Atlas for a GTI.
shut up dork saying this car is important is cringe as fuck
Still fuck OCPD lmfao old school h20i was so much better than it was in the past 12 years
I was on VW Vortex nonstop from 2009 to 2012. Good memories.
Where yall find $5k/7k anything running? I can’t buy anything running for under $10k
“The sketchier the WiFi, the better the coffee” put that on garm!
07K Turbo Syncro, let's goooooo!
There is a 3.2 L VR6 golf for auction on BaT right now, super clean and would be a fun project car for anyone looking.
Biggest issue is trying to find a MK3 or MK4 with out rust. The front fenders and Rockers get eating up.
I'm giving you another chance, I'm not subscribing just yet... But I might 😊 don't get greedy like donut did
Parts are expensive
You need to bring back LIGHTNING LIGHTNING LIGHTNING:
you  never had to convince anyone lol, golfs are amazing
have a MK2 GTi and the project never ends, hahaha
I got my Mk3 Golf by accident but I am glad and I love it and I love seeing more people appreciate it 🥺
I do miss my 95 jetta gt It was fun
i do ur channels name
Id rather walk than have golf project car
It would be nice if you could get into a decent mk3 for under 6k now, but I’m not sure that will ever be the case again.  I need to get back on ABF swapping my mk2, having the engine sitting in the garage, and the car turn tornado pink in the driveway is just sad.
I got no friends,  i got FAMILY 😂
I am golf and you can too
midwest emo car tunner
Was fortunate enough to see this car in the flesh a the L'oe Show in pottstown. Shoutout Jamie Orr. Gorgeous mk3 and im glad you got it back James
Bro tries to call the out the biggest German Car youtuber even tho hes building a Polo not a Golf get your fronts straight
god i hate how Travis Scott got that rare BMW and totally butchered it!!
Who wants to help me AWD swap my mk4 Golf TDI?
I have an 09 golf GTI that I love. Like in a normal car love type of way… I wanna hang out w the cool golf kids
Dang why was mk7 left out every time the gens were mentioned 😂. IE stage 2 on the mk7 gti is a WHOLE ENTIRE driving experience.   Jetta is just a golf with a butt needs put on a shirt or sticker in your store if it isn’t already😂
Shitbox lol
So what happened with donut?
man fuck it put a 2jz in it
It's alive!
Next project, a VW phaeton 😤
You probably didn't know your car was named after a magazine.
Played NFS Most Wanted and that’s when I fell in love with the GOLF GTI. 😭😭😭😭
What ever happened to that car you did on donut right before you left
James  I own a MKIII Jetta 5speed.  I had the floors cut out and welded in new ones.  I bought aftermarket rockets and my body guy welded/painted them for $900.  Hit everything with black, Fluid Film.  All my suspensupnmis now and coated with Black, Fluid Film.  It has an NGP-built 2.0 with Techtonics 270 cam, chip, down pipe, etc.  It's dusty mauve.  About to hit 30 years ownership.  Wouldn't trade it for a 959!   Anything can be fixed!  Go for it! Love that color.  I stop after MK4s! Carry on!!
VW is the entirety of the brazilian car scene
I had one of the four MK2 Golf Country AWD in Canada, and I sold it on VWVortex. The guy who bought it ended up living in it for a few months at one point.
Man, I used to spend so much time on TCL (The Car Lounge)
Every time I watch a speeed video I realize that James was the heart and soul of donut
"the best project"... yeaaaah :D ofc... Had a few of them, those cars are a POS pain in the butt ever-breaking pile of garbage. glhf...
0:50 "so we can hang out"😂
My wife thinks all golfs are ugly… I think she is wrong, but I’m still not allowed to get one. :(
If you're going to spend the money to fix everything.....Might as well.....get a new car.
I have an 99% clean 1981 mk1 1,6 Diesel.  With gti interior.
i love you gained a lot of attention after quitting Donut. you deserve it. also you got a Camera man!!! lets gooooooo
I’ve been slowly planning a vw scirocco or rabbit mk2-mk5 tdi build, just depends on pricing when i finally figure out logistics, absolutely love volkswagen, growing up my mom had a 99 VW beetle 1.8t and dad had a mk2 golf 1.6 N/A, never forgot the feeling of being in those cars or the love for VW, and as long as I’ve been growing up I will absolutely end up with a TDI diesel vw.
Came in to take a break from working on my MK4 and found this video! Also, shoutout to @HumbleMechanic for his amazing videos!
Hell yeah, these golf platforms are insane, I have myself a seat Ibiza (the 6k)  wich is based on the golf 3 and it's a blast It handles like crazy, even with no mods and it's super light so even if you go for a smaller engine or a diesel you can have some real fun in the corners
The focus isn't bad either
We love James Pumphrey
Bros the king of vibez
Perfect vid, my first car ever was 99' Mk3 Variant 1.9D, and still have it, making it into a perfet project/meet car
Haha. I’m guilty of the comments on price increases. It’s not untrue either.
The Golf is better.
I remember VW vortex as well I'm still on there every so often
Community, Friendship, Brotherhood... Family.
I have a mk2 golf and i love it!
VW Golf's were the opitme of ALL SHOW no go
I prefer toyotas
You should have seen my  corrado
I think South Africa has a crazy VW culture you should check it out.
My first car was a MK3 Jetta. I loved that thang.
I had a ‘98 golf with the NA 1.8 in it when I was stationed in Germany and wish I was able to bring it back with me, but it was 3 years shy of the 25 year import law. Woulda have been sweet to have a euro spec golf here.
Been with ClubVWOfLouisville in Kentucky since I was 3 years old. Grew up in and around Mk1 thru to Mk4 all my life. Love them.
"Just VW's. No Porche's, no Audi's".....Um, wait a second here. Aren't those?! You know what, never mind.
I would only buy a VW Golf if I was a 19 year old girl with a short temper and daddy issues.
Early 2000's euro scene was epic.
1552Design 2000s Babyyy
120 percent nostalgia! My second car was a 98 Mk3 Golf GTI with a VR6, loved modding that car. Took it to Waterfest and other east coast shows and sure enough, most of my friends were people I met thru VWVortex. Seeing the old screen shots of Vortex brings back memories, and even saw a couple of my old buddies listed as moderators (lookin at u ventodan!). Can't wait to binge the rest of the videos of the series. Keep it up dude!
grew up in a mk3 jetta k2 edition, sweet cars despite all the electrical fuckery youll come across.
This makes me miss my mkIII Jetta😕
Awesome, but spelled community wrong lol
She said don’t, don’t let it go to your head 🎶🎶🎶
I miss H2Oi so much.  When it was at the horse track, it was epic.  it went to hell in a hand basket after it moved away from that location.  I go to OCMD every year with family, and it's funny to see the reactions I get from the locals.  THEY HATED US.  My wife asks me to not bring up the fact I was a part of that.  lol
Ben and Jerry’s was started in a VW Type 2.
I have a golf 4 2.0 for 2001in black  And i had 4 more golf mk 3 and 4 cabriolet
Do the cc
I spent a ton of time on VWV. I miss my MK4 Jetta.
A fun and cheap car project is a Volvo S40 T4 or the newer Volvo S40 T5
great to see, love when you started this car. And yeah, been telling people this shit for over 20 years but now i wanna keep it quiet, keep the golfs for the people who truly enjoy them.
Gotta ditch that cheap mic dude, it’s noticeable
8:37 Commuinity
Bro you should put a Ap ethanol engine on it, like they do in Brazil on the Gol. It would be unique for the US!
Yes!!!, back to cars. Thank you.
I'm more of a BMW girlie, but the VW Golf is super cute! I'd drive one :))
Love your content but this video was like 6 minutes of actual content and 15 minutes of pure filler
Obi wan carnobi had me dead
Wait where was the video posted of you and that tech in the shop in LA? Ive seen that video was it on donut?
Omg Brett is in the James video (the e30 guy) 8:06
well, you might as well
2001 jetta 🥲 damn  car never died or let me down  , even not being able to go into last gear still better mpg then most cars .... will always regret selling it
right on, i always wondered what happened cause i never went to anything
Don’t think any day will match up to the day my golf made it into PVW with a big spread
As a mainer in one of the worst rust areas,  wed fix that rust for sure.
It got not Replikaded the Golf from Jp is a whole other thing and on a different Level its a Race Car Not a rusty ugly thing
Yo that’s @brett07k !!!
I already have the non-cool 96' 200SX B14 chassis. I have a 96' Ford Taurus, and a Chevorlet Impala. I don't need a golf 😭
I knew someone when I was in grade school who owned a 2002 Jetta. I don't know why, but I wanted to be like him in every way. So, naturally, when the conversation came up, us youngin's would talk about what cars we wanted. "Camero". Someone would way "Mustang", another...  I said "Jetta"...  Most people laughed at me. Then the one guy who actually owned a car (so he obviously knew everything) said NO NO NO! Jettas are DOPE (he had seen Fast and the Furious). So I somehow got shoved into the german car world.   To this day I love that car. I've never owned one, but maybe after this video I might poke around...
my mk5 gti appreciates this video
I’m the same way about the early 80’s Celica’s. Best looking one by far in my opinion. It’s nice to see content that focuses on the sentimental value of a car and not the Logistics of a build. Some builds are just not logical, its sentimental value that makes a car great.
im poor sorry
Now this makes me miss my mk3 😢
Golfs are cool, gonna swap a 2.0 atmo instead of 1.4
Tow truck driver should've used dog bone straps and left your wheels alone brother!!!! Seeing the strap through the rims pulled my back out as I shouted NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Golfs are awesome man! I remember modding the hell out of a GTI on NFS Underground back in the day and dreaming about buying one. Last year I had one pop up near me and am now the proud owner of a 2000 GTI VR6 :D
I have a Mk4 with a 2.8vr6 and the amount of crap I've gotten from so many car people I know here cuz of the engine option was super discouraging. But this video definitely has helped me feel better about it lol
My 07’ GTI is sitting in the driveway and needs lots of work. Can’t decide to invest in it or get rid of it
How much boost were you pushing on it? 😂 vw vortex I’m always on there. Great place to go for help.
Lost so much weight
I have an 02 Jetta Vr6 love it
Bro i just realized he mispelled Community to Commuinity
Bro I’ve missed your videos.
My god i just finally realized how much thinner you are! Looking good james!
YAP
15:10 where tf is spain? hahahaha
Does anyone know what mic he uses, just out of curiosity lol
Speeed and Big Time are sooo much better than Donut. It feels way more genuine now. A colab would be awesome!
I got my little 03 golf with a butt
Ride it to a car meet up, and record how people who dont know this car from Donut react. :)
Yeah dude. I am rocking that VR6 in my 96 Passat
north americans : we started it  we own it we cant even pronounce it the correct way  meanwhile in germany :  🤣🤣🤣  its cute how delusional the tommy´s are
RESONATED with growing up in Kentucky, and I didn't fit in with V8 stuff. I love the euro scene.
I wish I could just give you my old motor. I sold my car to some young guys and i guess they thought it wasnt salvageable. It was a 93 mk3 golf with a 2.9 vr6 from a passat. That engine was indestructable. No idea where it is now. I still own the car lol they never transfered it over.
James thank you for opening my eyes a bit more
Haven‘t watched the vid but i already started my golf project Golf 3 Cabrio in cucumber Green 🤙🏼🤙🏼
Why?... y? James... does the 2.8 vr6.. sound so soo amazing?.. y?? Does me luv it soo so much? I would definitely f it.. wit my ears.. sober.. most definitely drunk.. mk3.. mk4.. gd it.. I fuggin love that sound.. I don't care.. f every other sound.. made from cars.. v8s yea sound pretty.. but that vr6 bro.. ohhh geez rick
Not gonna lie lad, where I live Mk3 are considered the ugliest generation of Golf, close second is Mk4, but thats just my area and me.
0:15 JP´s Golf is completely different and has nothing to do with yours. tf you mean replicated just look at it.
Quite literally bought a Mk6 GTI because of you. It has been the best and most fun car I've ever had.
Cool man vw is my first fwd after 30 years of driving rwd I bought my tdi for a jeep rwd swap and fell in love with how good it feels ...with back tune and turbo though
i had a mk3 vr6 in 04 when i was 17 i had those same head lights n my shit was slammmmed
I watched the video that came out 2 videos AFTER this one so I saw the detailed breakdown of what exactly happened. But when you started it up here and all the smoke came out and stuff I could now perfectly visualize why everything was how it was. Really gave me a good understanding of so many things. Like what blow by is and looks like and what a bad rod bearing leads to and looks like and is and everything like that. Really appreciate the visual way that you explained everything.
Is the discord chat for the US only?
1.9 110 HP TDI is a Monster. Check them.
Just going to let you you are going blow the rode bearing in the 1# cylinder I hope that you get this message in time for you to save it 😜
Im english, you dont need to convince me how good a golf is. Massively popular model over here.
Corrado
If it wasn't for that brutal torque steer, I would be a much bigger fan of the Golf.
Is a RS3 a spicy golf with a butt?
These Speeed videos get better with every upload
So right away along with the “ cool” engine parts you’ll need even cooler trans parts
This is the content I love bro can’t wait
coming back here from the other video to say chris called it from the jump lol so cool
I grew up with passat B3 generation i love golfs but i prefer passat especially B2 B3 B4 real passats  but b3 is my favorite i have 3 passats could buy another one colecting it like hotwheels toy cars😂 and restoring it😁
you should go to bugrun in mantorp sweden if you love VW!
Always been a VW guy and always will be. Mk2 is my favorite👌
Hell yeah, I've  missed this car!!!
Fucking love this shit mannnn🫦😂
Hell yeeeeeeaaaah ❤
VW are gay. Nazi cars.
Now I miss my 2001 vr6 cabrio😂
We in the Netherlands also love golf very much
are you on ozempic >? that shii will kill ya  stay safe
As a european, volkswagen hype just seems funny to me.
Im building a budget mk4 jetta super budget but super cool holla at me
Just buy a mk1 2 or 3...dont be gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
we need a colab with you and Jimmy Oaks, him and Brian are crazy about VW's and would make for sick content
Watching this makes me sad about having to sell my 03 vr6
my guy loooking rufffffff here . \
is a GTI a golf? lol I have been a Mazda guy for years but I did buy a 24 GTI as it was the last year of the manual transmission and I always wanted one
I miss my Corrado SLC VR6 5 spd.
In Fance, the golf fan-club is basically your local thug with a seat too low for the steering wheel, a backward cap.... and a really annoying AK-tune free exhaust... I'd say the newer models attracts more thugs than the earlier ones but still... I would never buy a Golf.
You’ll be surprised about the Golf’s in the UK everyone has one
i Love the MK1, MK3 and MK4 golf's
UwU a 1995 MK3 was my first car. Buyed it out of first hand and the prowner already installed sport shocks... miss it but  no space for more cars and I love my 2008 LC200 with manual gearbox (wich probaply is one of only 10-20 around in Europe).....
James,  This was a great trip down memory lane!!   For any VW nut including myself, we all wanted to get our cars featured in PVW!!  I was very active in the VW show scene on the East Coast in the early to mid-2000s!!  I still go on VW vortex once in awhile just to see you if there's any deals on parts!!!  I sold my ginster yellow VR6 GTI a few years ago.  But still have eight other 80s and '90s VW.  MK1 GTI, two Corrados , 80 Scirocco with a callaway turbo system, 92 Montana green GTI 16v!!!  The list goes on and on!!!  The late 90s through the early 2000s was a great time to be into watercooled VWs.    Unfortunately the scene is definitely not the same!!!
BBL Golf
I had a 93 or 96 vr6. I remember now, some lady hit me like 6 days after I bought it.
didnt knew he drove a G Wagon
I wish i had my mk4 golf gti still but i sold out and bought an R36 Passat
you rule james
Miata is always the best bang for the buck build. Easily
Love my GTI MK6!
Bought my first VW last year. MK5 R32
My mk4 gti was built in the peak of the early 2000s vw craze and was featured in Motortrend Magazine. Iv owned something like 23 mk4s at this point, and counting. Volkswagens are truly an addiction and I'm so glad you're bringing them back to popularity like this
Donut without James and the crew is just..... Nut🍆💦
Donut is lost without you guys. Lol.  Yeah they might have the budget but the experience Way subpar. And who's that new f****** weird kid on donut. Clearly he has no experience. Clearly he's reading off the script.  Clearly he's gay.  Dei hire?
Bought a Mk5 GTI last night pretty much because of you
I've had a mk3 4 Dr golf for close to 20 years. On air. Customish interior it's been a personal labor of love. And I just bought a 08 rabbit 2.5. I'd kill to hang out man. Dream of a lifetime to work with cars and be able to build a lifestyle around my favorite car. My mk3.
If you're that passionate about a volkswagen, you should ABSOLUTELY pay a visit to Brazil...
Anyone have any recommendations for upgrades on a 2004 1.8t audi quattro?
My mom has a golf mk3 td once i get a drivers licens i get the car my moms golf is a black 4 door and i realy realy like it
smart of you to tap into the epic market that is VW heads to build your new brand. good luck
older bro had a '97 VR6 GTI for most of my youth, such a lovely car. I've been driving and maintaining an '05 MK4 Golf TDI PD for the past decade. drove a 4door '91 325i e30 the decade before that. Have a thing for German cars other than our '01 7.3 PS E350. Excited to see this puppy shine once again.
I bought a mk6 TDI and the dude was recording and cried a little when i bought it😭😭
I bought a mk4 golf tdi for 1000 bucks. 300,000 on the clock and want it to go to 500,000
In Brazil they were the hype until 2020 approximately. They were like a step-up from anyone that had a gol (a specifc volkswagen for Brazil)
Yessss the blue lagoon is back baby 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Das ding ist golf‘s sind hier in Deutschland nichts besonderes / NPC Auto DESWEGEN werde ich mir NIEMALS ein golf holen… vor allem golfs bzw vw hat ein schlechtes Image in Deutschland ich weiß nicht wie der Image von VW in usa aussieht ich vermute mal cool
What happend to the AE86
Naaaa the one from JP Performers is Not a Replika
Jp Performance Golf G3 nice
Have 2 mk1 project rabbits. They look sick, have tons of character.
Another reason to buy one: The way they smell!   There's a certain odor that I've only smelled in old VWs.
Why does james always look so sick? His nose looks like not so good, get better buddy.
HYUNDAI TIBURON 2003 - 2008 >
Fine, you got me, I'll weld the damn side skirts on my Otmar Alt.
in rest of the world, these are considered trash
For the look of your engine, I can say this is a classic case of ''Danger to Manifold''
I understand wanting to keep a car just because it means something to you. I have a 2005 Outback XT that's completely seized up (bad oil pump starved the engine and killed it). Normally, I'd probably just sell the car and get a different one because it's cheaper, but this particular one was owned by a late friend of mine. That alone makes the cost to fix it worth it, for me.
I dated a chick off the Vortex. Good times. 81 Rabbit Cabby 1.7Gas.
Go Rocks!!!! I went to trinity too
I'm cooking breakfast and a water droplet fell on the like button
Love my mk3 jetta
I had a 2001 VR6 MK4 and my stepdad sold it while I was in the military he forged my signature and it broke my heart when I got back and my car was gone 🥹
James I watch you on YouTube when I was just 16 years old now I’m 22 and I bought an mk6 Golf R any tips about owning a vw?
Castor Motorsport is down the street from me I wish I could meet James
Thanks to James, I just picked up a mk6 golf tdi.... Absolutely love it so far. It needs some work on the interior but otherwise it's real solid
PLEEEQASSEE MAKE THIS INTO A SERIES
Man I miss the vw vortex days before the Facebook groups ruined the scene in so many ways
Stop telling everyone ‘bout the 07k.
Saying JPs Golf is a replica of your Golf is a stupid claim. JPs and your Golf has nothing to do with each other xD
does a audi a3 tfsi count? LOL
Vw cars are hondas for white ppl
That's good,  man screw donut. They really became a complete joke, reviewing tik Tok shit instead of doing car builds n all that. Glad you left em!
Bro is getting more views in 2 weeks than donut is racking up in months. We love you james
dope hat
Can you do a up to speed on the ford coyote?
Mk3s are top tier, I absolutely love my 97 glx, its a 12v turbo on e85. built the car from a bare shell and its just an absolute blast to drive.
Hey talk about the altezza, so it can go up in price too
I love that community was spelled wrong
Help me understood the vw golf scene.  I grew up modifing Hondas in the 90s I felt like there was alot of vw euro bmw guys hate on "RICER" honda guys. I just wanted something reliable but not rice. I always felt like the euro cars were just as bad as the ricers sometimes.
In the balkans… the golf community is insane!! I had 2 mk3, and a jetta i mean vento, still have the only vento glx 2.0 16v in Croatia
i currently have a 5cyl jetta project.. its not MY project from the start im just stuck with it because it doesnt run right doesnt start right when it does you can press the accelerator for all your life and wont move it has more fault lights then a christmas tree has lights..  the owner is now in it for over $2500 in parts (on top of finding out it has a scrap yard replacement engine with unknown miles the scrap yard refuses to tell me but they do know) and its slowly getting fixed but dear god why did they put so much useless junk on the 5cyl.... cant wait to get my shop back.. TB, shocks, springs, BCM, weak fuel pump, harness all toast its been to 3 other shops and no one would even try to fix it they said nope scrap it.. im only fixing it as a favor as im a ASE diesel  Ford mechanic.
Pumped to see that beauty coming back
you volkswagen guys are a different breed...
Does this mean you’re going to return Donut’s microphone?
My 95 2.5l Eurovan made it home with a Pac-Man chunk out of the top of the piston. These engines are great
But I already got a VW project car...and an Isuzu project car...and...a Harley project bike....
mk3 been there  done that, they are amazing to work on but the parts really aren't that widely available. Plus videos like this literally make people go out and ruin the market for being able to get started with something. When in doubt, do exactly the opposite of what youtubers do. THAT- is how you actually build a budget car.
if you can afford a mk7 gti they’re absolutely awesome. Literally perfect for the price
Just snagged a clean 2021 Tiguan after your most recent video! Not quite a gulf but still looking forward to wrenching around on it!
YSOAB IM IN
Got a Ford Focus mk2 ST with a beautiful Volvo 5 cylinder turbo engine. Also a big 5 cylinder fan 😁
This video brings back lots of fond memories. I had a 1993 vr6 Corrado and was on vortex with a few gal friends. Vw car scene was really cool experience ❤. Love the color of this project car and I look forward to seeing it revamped.
I had 3 git’s 83,90,92 .. but corrados were my jam.. had 3 90,90,91 g60 , then turbo swap, then lysholm supercharger from barn Brennen motor sports .. I was an og on the vortex …
It's beautiful 👍
You said not really to JPs G3 replicating? 🤔
Love a Golf, but I’ll forever be a MK1 Focus master race  Also, 20+ years on The Vortex 🫡
I think something that Donut has been missing the past year or so is a deep, emotional, almost nostalgic connection between the hosts and the content - the cars. James, your little five minute prelude to this video is a perfect example of why the audience cares about you and the content that you make. People are tired of manufactured, optimized, and planned content. We want to see something real, something you really care about because YOU care about. No disrespect to the guys still at Donut, I still watch their videos and not all of them fall victim to this (Jimmy's recent escapade to Tokyo is actually a good counterexample to my argument), but at the end of the day, we're all here because we like you and we like cars. Thank you, James.
This video makes me want to drive my blue lagoon mk4 that's been with me for 18 years.   Vortex days were dope - 1.8dubbin
Can I be your friend if I start working on a 1992 VW Fox that's been sitting in our shop for 15+ years?
07k going in my 86 scirocco currently
Missed these informative videos.
Can’t believe Donut actually let James go….he was like their Tom Brady and look what happened to the patriots without TB 👀
100% agree mk3 golf and corrado’s are possible the coolest looking cars ever made.
Had '95 Jetta GLX.   I was on VW Vortex too, usually trying figure out how to fix my coilpack (JB Weld), buy Transforma grill, or figure out how to make the corner indicator lights blink in alternate with the turn signal.
Is that calypso blue mettalic?
and just like that, the 90s golf market price increased by 200%.
This weird ozempic user should have stayed with donut....least liked person on from that channel. Also, put some socks on clown.
well it took some time for the us to catch the golf fever bud in europe it for sure is not the best bang for youre money project car honestly if u look lonmg and hard enough u can get almost any type of car for a good price ass a project car ut just takes time for example i bought a mx 5 nbfl recently for 4000 euros and it already had resto mod chasis work done u know those structeral bits that are know to rust now i got not a layerd farme parts wichs means rust iseu solved ass far as it can be solved and honestly its a great great car even for how muchs it is drivin the engine stil is smooth and spicy
Good to see you again James now doing your own thing  I think I stop watching donut maybe four years ago and haven’t seen you since  The vw will need some work but will be sweet when done  Good on you keep well 👍👍🇦🇺
JTI > GTI
Have fun with replacing all the electrical.
Didnt even realize i was subscribed...  Donut isnt the same
i"M more into Vw Scirocco Mk3 i think they"re awesome but this is nice content too.
no lie watching to motion of you flipping through old car magazines gave me a flash back of my childhood before the internet of me sitting in the living rom flipping through the old magazines
RWD & VR6 SWAP!!
Nope, Miata gang for life
Wondering why the Mirage never gets the same love. Similar kind of car. Next to no love.
You look like you have gotten super healthy. Good on you
If that rust isn’t bad then my wrangler is rust free😂
Dude, the Top Gear TV show came first in the 1970s!! The magazine was a 90s spinoff of that.
These cars would be the only choice if they were rear wheel drive.
Souping up VW like he’s in South Africa
You should do the hack with heating dent with heat gun then spray air in a can upside down so it sprays all the cool liquid to pull the dent
I just picked up a MkV Rabbit when I was looking for a beater to build out for AutoX and RallyX.  I was originally looking for a MkI Focus, but I'm really glad I came across the Rabbit.
Not a mk3 or golf but still a vw, i recently acquired a mk4 jetta wagon and im so hype
I love this kind of content. Youre the reason i started watching Donut, and the reason i dont anymore 😬. Now if you could just get Jerry for some videos it would be perfect 😎
“Commuinity.”
“Might as well”
lets goooo !!!!
Im not trying to be ignorant but is James still on good terms with the hosts at big time?
I just got an e-golf, and I used to have a mk3 Jetta. Let's hang out!
MO POWAH BABY
I love Dan and this Golf, but are we really going to say its the most bang for the buck? Someone wiegh in on this for me.
Hell yeah, man
South Africa Cape Toiwn is the place for ypu brother lile i have a vw polo and my friends tuned golfs
I live in England I can’t get insurance on a gti but can get a gtd thoughts
JAMES. I bought a 1997 Golf Trek at the beginning of January, and here you are just a couple weeks ago saying they're the best bang for your buck project cars.. and mine ticks ALL the boxes.  It's never been documented, or finished. So, when can ya hang out? Lol
Own a pissant that is a total shit box and I only got 6million in so far
I’ve been saving up for my first project car and from all of my research you have provided the golf series as the most intriguing build car for me. Love the style, they look cute and cool at the same time, engine budget options are nasty too.
I’m building a golf so we can hang out. Good enough reason for me 😂
i had a mk3 golf with a neuspeed supercharger. i bought it for $4k when i was struggling as a college grad. money spent well, had so much fun in it.
I swear it's like you read my mind when you made this video.  I'm currently trying to get my hands on a 2012 Golf R in the next couple of weeks.
I lost it when he said, "A jetta is just a golf with a butt!"😂😂
You'd love it in South Africa
I just got a mk7 the other week. I get it now.
Cool to see you fixing your golf 3. And i got to say personally the chassis is fun and pretty good and there is alot you can do with them like our team making a track car out of it.
I just bought a 5 speed mk6 Golf 2.5L for 7k. Absolutely love this car!
i had a project 2001 vw golf gti vr6 with 100 thousand miles on it , these cars are awesome BUT good luck fixing the coolant pipe on these cars lol .
I love Golfs in the mid 90's my friend owned a '96 GTI VR6 and would run with a group than ran a VW mod mail order business.  This was also in Kentucky.  One time this group was doing a convoy on back roads and flipped a Scirocco. Totaled the car but thanks to the harness the driver survived with only the gnarliest of bruises. They kept the stripped body in the lobby of their shop.  In the end a mod caused my friend's engine to blow. The mail order company grew quickly only to succumb to credit card fraud.  I wish I could remember more of the details but it was good times.
James pumping my MK3 bags lets GOOOOO
I'll be real with you. A mk iv golf with a stick and a vr6 sounds lovely
Lol just got a mrk4 jetta tdi
I'm so happy to see you doing an in depth car project. I love your videos but this car I think represents the core of the guy we all fell in love with
The Golf Scene Here in Germany ist crazy, but Not evry Golf, almost every VW, and Opel, ...
Season 2 episode 24 of two broke girls "is that a store or something? Holler!"
I mean, R32 is the only real golf.
Now older golfs are gonna skyrocket
I have a MK2 Jetta that I just wanna get rid off 😢
Great episode! Hey James, check out Volksmania magazine. It’s gorgeous and features all the great generations of Volkswagens.
I bought a 95 vr6 for $2,500, it was tornado red, straight piped, my first manual, and it by far is the most car for $ that I’ve ever owned, it chirped tires up to 3rd gear, it spit flames, and If I could pay it any respects I’d love to have a clean garage kept version now, what a car, give me the crayon German muscle car of the early 90s I want one again
man i got a 1972 ford galaxy 500 but no money to fix it up with hopefully can save up enough to fix her up
DONUT FOR LIFE
All I heard is we need to bring back old car meets and that's a yes! No takeover bs
2:40 the awesome Audi A2.
Best car at donut
I still got my mk4 in a tornado red, 184k odo been rear ended by a carrado, then went and rear ended a tesla and amazon truck buckled my fender. But I still work on it and DD it everyday. Also iso of a grille lol
Me and my buddy both have golfs, I have a mk7 gti and he has a mk6 tdi
From personal experience, an old gti is strong. My friend flipped his when we were out for a drive and it was totaled, but we were perfect my fine
Love James... Great episode, instantly my new favorite channel ❤💯
Only watching speeed for the medium build merch, jk but happy you’re throwing support
I went to H2oi from 2014-2020 and the guys that got me going to H2oi had been going since the beginning. That shit was the best. I’m not a huge VW guy but damn do they have a piece of my heart from what they have given car culture.
Let’s go james, make your own content, make better content
My first car was a mk 3 and I loved that thing. I ended up scrapping it due to not wanting to spend more money on it to get it through EU approval. I have regretted getting it scapped ever since.
Great vid. Makes me miss my Mk3 GTI VR6. And loving Castro's optimism.
I love my Golfs. Got a built MK4 GTI 20th AE. Best purchase I’ve ever made and I stand by that. Still running strong.
Day one of saying Matt from Matt’s off road recovery looks like James dad
Is Mattsoffroadrrcovery your dad?
Hey James i don‘t think that Jp Performance copied your car…. maybe the wheels are looking quit similar because rotiform and the colour. But they are no more similarities
8:35 how did you NOT throw in "family" haha - too obvious? maybe, probably.
Put the SWAG in VolkSWAGen
Turn it off before it locks up. Thing is got hella blow by. Stop talking while it's running like that. Dammmmmn
You good bro? You've been fighting back a lot of tears in the vids...
I love that color, what's the exact color you used for that golf?
Trinity alum?  Go rocks!
Oh shit over a mil subs. Lets go💪
When did bro get so handsome? Good to see him looking so healthy.
I just bought a jetta because you said so
Maaaaaan I remember vortex!
The MK2 has been on my list of project cars to maybe get. I would love to find one a 24hr lemons race.
I have had 2 separate 07Ks Rabbit and Jetta, MK5s. I will own no other, EVERRRR. except for my daughter's Yota's 2zz Celica and my wife's 2GR-FE.... BUT THAT'S IT!!!!!! And I will roll on you in the Sienna. The Sienna will dogggg the Jetta 2.5
Commuinity
so, quick question. i have a 2008 Volkswagen Golf Plus TDI that i payed 100k for (Norweigan Krone btw, chill! that's around 9k USD.) and i was wondering if it is a decent Project Car, as i REALLY want to make it into a car that really rounds out my style nicely. is it, or is it not a good project car?
"Might as well... throw in forged internals and make 500 hp" lmao whenever I talk like this my partner says I have brain worms.
Just bought a mk4 Jetta yesterday because of this video, best purchase of my 17 years of life
Oh hell yeah. My first car, 1997 GTI VR6 in Windsor blue metallic. Still a ‘dream’ car for me, if I can find a mint one!
Feeling gets hurt. People talk they negative. It takes someone to speak up . Sandro decided it was time. Respect him for that because I'm sure there is alot said not on the net.   I do believe everyone should have said what they needed to and hug it out, but like i said Sandro basically got tired of it. Can't say if he was wrong or right saying it and uploading it.   Guess we will find out
Здарова, за моду когда видосы? Я к тебе от Муро пришел, нравится ролики о карате и стусси. Давай пиши чаще за моду, вроде чего то умеешь
OH MY... This is gonna be fun! VW still making people get into cars since... the war (pun intended lol) I also started with Volkswagens in the early days (Aircooleds in my case, had a split windows Bus) and made the best friends base I have today from that era! It's crazy. My brother also had a Golf just like this one (too bad he decided to sell it and I got sad but still) I love these frogs! Good luck with it and hope to see more videos as well as a build breakdown and follow up! Give us this content please
Your enthuisasm is amazing and so is the 5-cyl swap, as these sound insane. Hearing someone call a Golf "unique" feels odd to me, as it's the most sold car (read most boring) over here. Especially the MK3 in my youth was the car everybody drove, no mod you didn't see before, nothing that was unique. So the year before getting my licence, I swore to myself, to never get a boring Golf and sticked to that. However, as it's getting more rare even here (talking of seeing it run "H" for historic licence plates), rebuild that thing, especially make that amazing 5-cylinder engine run and put out more power. Go for it, it will be amazing!
I’m in the uk, I have a mk3 polo coupe boulevard, was thinking of putting another engine in it. Anyone recommend anything?
love the 2.5 content, but hate the fact that the engines are going to go up like crazy.. Its been one of the best kept secrets. Not only are the 2.5 engines cheap but also reliable. Need to do a 1000+ repair on it? Just buy a new motor lol
We had one in the 90's, brand new. A complete piece of shit, a/c stoped working all the time, suspension was made of glass, power windows always break down. A Fiat Tipo was a much better car in all ways.
Sorry James, I already got a Del Sol to build
Dang, seeing it get this worn out after restoration is crazy. It's like getting PT for years, then getting kneecapped right after.
This seems like perfect timing, I'm picking up my MK7.5 Golf R today!
Did James lose weight? He looks great!
Me and my buddy sold our 7.3 power strokes for gtis really fun cars bought my 2012 3 years ago with 55k miles now it has 82k miles
I have a mk1 Citi golf. I soooooo want to modify that beauty.
fine ill get my 94 runnin again
Me with my Mk6 that has been sitting for a year because I bought an STi and haven’t been able to work on it since the cold weather hit 😭😭😭
You will not make me miss my GLX and buy another rusty car almost as old as myself!! You can’t do it man!!!😅
Not joking about the 2.5s rising up to popularity. I've had my 07k Rabbit for two years now and watching these engines pop up more and more in the mainstream is so cool to see
I dont have a golf but I got a mk6 jetta tdi and I love it
Some people do fix unibodies
To say that rust is okay is beyond me. I love to see people not give up on cars though so I am totally here for this
It’s not like the community for Subaru. 😂😂😂
eeh, less fun civic... probably less reliable fiesta or focus. but yeah a decent base for a project for those interested in the vw group rare parts grind
So many goosebumps watching this video DAMN!
The Kentucky cobra is so back!
They are definitely not cheap anymore unfortunately
i only know of these guys because of Forza Horizon 5
James, you brought back some great memories of years I owned MK2's and hung out with the VWVortex group out of Vegas in the mid 2000's, still friends with most of those people today.  2 Car's I always regret selling. My 90 Jetta GLI with the 16V 2.0L and my NA Miata; Miata was always fun to drive but the Mk2 was faster than it needed to be, more comfortable, cause who doesn't love Recaro seats from factory, and a 5 speed close ratio transmission that would spin tires through multiple gears.  Let alone the fact you could basically rebuild a Mk2 with Zipties, DuctTape, and a 10 and 11mm socket!  Thanks for making me start looking for project cars for my now teenage kids for us to work on.  Best of luck on your journey James and pointing the spotlight on this awesome scene again.
i love jetta, as many times as diesel gate tried to take it away.. sell me another one.. I said over my dead body. Something about a VW makes you happier. :D
My first car was a Golf 3 GTI 8V. Loved it!
07k >
VW's til the day I die brother ❤ Keep doing rad VW things 👌👌👌
“Lemme tell you a story” 2:00 😎
OMG! Super pumped for this!!
The Golf mk3 was always a fugly construction worker car
What bout 60s bugs?
I was so ecstatic when I made it into PVW, not full front page but 5 page feauture and a small baby pic on the cover, MKV with MKVI gti frontend conversion
Currently looking for a Car.  Looks like I got a Golf in sight now, Possibly an R 🤔🤔
i have a 2007 rabbit... does that count?
I have a 3 cylinder golf mk7.5 my dad convinced me to get one he used to have a mk1 gti and god I love the car to much for a 3 cylinder it’s so fun and rowdy. Also convinced my friend to get a golf mk4 😏
The CD player in my 2010 golf finally died on me, was ready to get a new car, but this video has convinced me to rebuild
8:41 famly
you should turn this car into harlequin edition
Ive owned 2 MK6 GTIs and now i own a 2024 Golf R! been loving the VW platform.
Effin A, sick. Let me know if i can help. I dont know much about cars but i do specialize in grunts and nods of approval.
But it doesn’t have a V8 and it’s not rear wheel drive 🤮
Where can i get a link to the discord?
James I love this and am about your age. I have my mk2 I recently restored and motor swapped a G60 into. I am am the OG owner of my mk4 R32 and was a VW tech for 20 years. Hit me up anytime, I am headed to ButtonWillow beginning of March for a trackday.
Castro you are the man awesome diagnosis
kind of a shame to see you worked with jamie orr to get that golf back in the day. homie is actually a HUGE leach on the VW scene, specifically in the mk1 and mk3 communities.
I’ve had 3 mk2 golfs. I regret getting rid of the first two. I just love them.
1.9TDi best engine for beginners. Lasts long and easy to repair. Lots of cheap spare and tuning parts. Mine was 90PS, invested about 200€ and some time to do OBD-tuning by myself and boom - 150PS
I got a bit emotional with you at the end of the video. I lived in Spain when my first car was a MK3 GTi 2.0 8v and I loved it... Then moved to Germany in 2013 and sold it for 500 eur because of high oil burning, KO heating core and saggy doors. I still have the original BBS RX I had on it in my parents garage... Might be time to make myself a gold with vento front. Always loved the mini-corrado style... Btw best engine in MK3 was the 2.0 16v!
15:55 he actually honked HAHAHHAHA
I recently thought about  building my mulberry 95 vw jetta. That has been sitting for about 7 years       This will be some inspiration as james continues this build
My first project car was a 95 jetta and i miss it all the time. It was AMAZING. So many thing I could never explain in just a YouTube comment. Then my BF and I bought a 96 golf for $500 that was imported from Columbia. All amazing experiences and boy do i want another
I bought a yellow 6-speed '08 Octavia vRS wagon as my first car partly because of how much you hype up Golfs (and because Mk5 GTIs are illegal for P plates and cheap reliable Mk3 and 4s are hard to find) and it's had the most fun I've ever had, plus there's such a good aftermarket for them because they're the exact same as a Mk5 GTI underneath. I've got so much I wanna do to it, but apprentice wages are a bit shit, so it'll be mostly stock for a while longer.
Dude you crushed this video! Ill support you in this journey!
My brother has a diesel Jetta, it damned quick for a diesel and it gets amazing fuel economy. (Im a bit of a diesel connoisseur.)  Its quiet and you can only really tell its a diesel when it hasnt quite warmed up yet.  I doubt they will go up in price, there very common here in the midwest and the most popular brands of import other than the venerable Toyotas and Hondas. You can easily find all sorts of performance and matinence parts in pretty much every common store that sells automotive stuff.  Im prolly gonna get some shit for this but it would be interesting to see someone manage to swap an American V8 into earlier model one.
Well now that you've brought attention to it, prices are going to shoot up...
i got mk4 jetta
Just got myself my own dream vehicle in an AW11 MR2 and its got rust i need to fix and some other minorisher...er things to do. This should be inspiring to watch. lets see who can finish their build first! (you... definitely you lol)
3:25 TAKING BACK SUNDAY MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣‼️‼️‼️‼️
Yes
James listens to Medium Build??
Mi infancia wey!
Thank you for the nostalgia. Mk4 was my first and went through about every platform before and after. In a Mk7 Golf R now and still get just as excited to drive it as my first car.
This was the video that finally gave me a reason to subscribe!!! Keep it up! <3
I have a MKVII - I’ve done some work to it - it’s my daily. Can it still be considered a “project car” allowing us to hang out? 😂
I just bought a MK4 GTI VR6 and I ABSOLUTELY love it. 🥲 wish I got one sooner.
On behalf of all of South Africa 🇿🇦 we welcome you James BTW the Golf MK1 was made till 2009 in south Africa because of its popularity. My personal favorite is the Golf MK2
Growing up the WV golf was everywhere!
I wish I was able to have Castro finish my e30 project. It will never happen, unfortunately. I live in South Africa, and I'm old and poor. I am glad for you to have the opportunity and means to make your Golf something special. Looking forward to see the final product!
I had my first car Golf MK3 aswell. It was driven over 500 000 km and still running without a problem. Every maintanance was easy to do and parts are cheap and easily available.
HYPE! Finally Speeeeeed back on track!!
I have mk6 1.6tdi 98KW stage 1+
I will die with my mk2 Jetta coupe.  Mk2/3 are definitely underrated these days and the death trap feeling just adds to the fun
I'm hyped for this
LS swap it and get rid of the ugly headlights 😂
I love you James
I learned to drive stick in my brother's '00 GTI VR6 🥲
VW eos is my favorite vw
This is really cool man.
This hit me in the feels. My 97 Windsor Blue GTi VR6 was the one that got away and I should've never sold.
I grew up never being attracted to VWs but remember seeing a Mk 1 Golf for the first time and being completely drawn to the clean, sharp and attractive lines of the it. Eventually I found a meticulously maintained one owner 78 Golf (Rabbit) champagne edition in inari silver for 5800. Got really attached to a car I went years not paying any mind to, definitely underrated vehicles.
hell yeah dude
R32 vw rabbits are pretty sweeet
Well dude I love your channel! I race and own a 84 GTI in ChampCar Endurance series! Named Turtle.
Can’t wait to see how this build goes!
i have seen them all, i wished for a mk3 but the MK6 was my first real golf but got screwed by a seller with the automatic gearbox. and now we have a E-Golf i hope that count? The only thing is i cant drive any more, so i am a passenger princess
Great video but now you're gonna make the prices of the Polos and Golfs sky rocket, and tbh GTIs are overrated when a 1.2 TSI is just as fast as 1.4 TDI
Still paying off my expensive ahh car but once im done with it i hope to find a 90s golf, they look super fun to drive and ive been wanting one for a good while now 😭
Just stay away from the 1.4 Engines
Yall had every opportunity to call him OBD ONE CARNOBI
8:38 Missed your chance to say "family"
Im not here for the Car related content.
I can't wait for this build! I have a 1987 Volkswagen Scirocco 16v that has moved around with the past 5 years. I can't get rid of it and this motivates me to get back to working on it.
i love my MK4 Vw Jetta Wagon. my son loves it too! when i was in my 20s i let people scare me about VWs as i was constantly told they were expensive to maintain and use. i bought a mk4 jetta sedan with a 2.0 and fell in love with this platform. ill keep my wagon for as long as i can!
I think you guys could make a great manual tutorial, would have my early days a lot easier lol
looking for a mk3 now... that makes me happy
Golf’s looks sick. Let’s talk about the VW scandal though..
Taking back sunday? Right on
I been searching those wheels for a while, where can i find them? Or how are thet called?
Love ya James, But you aint seen a lot of rust. haha
my main concern with another project car is the price of parts. I love my miata, but ill be damned if im paying $300 per headlight lenses again.
You should have restored a Corrado. That's what I want to do
I miss my blue purple pearl 1997 VW Jetta GLX =(  I was forced to give it up. This is after I had to give up my 1992 16v Jetta GLi. =(
James looks like an ozempic bro now
James, buddy to much talk. More car, less James’s face😉😁
Franck Muller up to speeed
I've bought a Golf mk2 as my first car. It is a delight to drive and looks sick with bbs wheels :)))
There's one for sale in Cali right now on eBay for 600 bucks
I appreciate James more now that he has this channel
Idk how I feel about the font of that “blocked websites”
7:44 2.5 for life! I have a 2011 mk6 Jetta 2.5 SE. I was surprised how fun it is when my dad got it for me, especially for an “econobox”. The NA 5 cylinder is crazy! Any simple recommendations to make my car more sporty and handle better from other 2.5 guys?
Totally interested in this series👍👍👍
Yeeeyahhhh…they keep getting more and more attractive as they get older. Awesome to see an A3 getting some quality love!
vwvortex or honda-tech the biggest 2 in history
As a Brit growing up working with my dad on people in towns cars (we beat all the big spanners prices!) I’ve seen my fair share of VW golfs, mostly 1.9 TDIs, Westminster  was giving big incentives for diesels at the time, they sounded like arse when I was growing up but now when I hear the clickityclack of a diesel golf it’s like a fresh bowl of mums stew. Just about to perma-move to the US myself to be with my merica wife. She understands my passion for all things mechanical even if she don’t share em. I’ll take you up on this challenge. When I get a solid job I’m putting away some cash for an early 2000s golf. Did you guys ever get the diesels? A 1.9Tdi ain’t the nicest engine but it’s my personal VW nostalgia icon.
Currently doing "Might As Well" HPA built block with FTX600 mods to @FranzR32T  Because Might As Well.  LOL
golf mk1 gti going for 20k or more right now
here in holland the golf is going up in price in 2016 you bought a golf mk4 for like 750€ now theye are around 3000k € or more depents on engine and interior  i have seen golfs mk4 r32 for over 20k€ right now back in the day 2014  you bought that same r32 for a smal 7500 €
everyone need a golf vr 6 in his life some point im from europe  and we love golfs golfs everyware
6:27 so smart
So?? You are not anymore with donut???  To be honest I started watching donut media because of your unique style and how funny you make the narrative of the  video. Good shit you started you own channel. I don’t watch donut anymore. I’ll subscribe to your channel and pitch donut it had become boring . Lots of new faces and chicks. Nah.
I still want a Corrado VR6, yellow....VW back in the day was IT!
TBS💚💚💚 Dude Kentucky and Maine must be cousins or maybe I'm just Kentucky in my soul 🤣
I followed a guy from South Africa who had one of these cars on momo aries wheels. Arguably one of the rarest 3 spoke wheels to ever exist as not many sets exist today. Made me love these cars.
Volkswagen golf prices after this video 📈📈📈📈
James... I've missed this humor and kinda insight.... PLEASE never change 🤌🤘🏎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i love this car
My mk6 jetta has the 2.5 and a 5spd manual.  Its slow af but it sounds cool as hell😂
I prefer MK3 and MK4
RUST for a California Car?? Why??
This content keeps me going
2:18 I never thought a mustang could look worse
Can we get an up to speeed on the BMW 507 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
I hear the 1.9 GDI with the turbonwas decent if taken care of
i just bought a mk1 cabriolet because of this video
Ahh yes marketing Nord VPN? The company that has major security issue already more than once :D Those VPN companies that truly are secure don't pay for ads...
peep my pfp. the guy that built this car in the 2000s put it together then left it in a parking lot for 15 years. 2.0 built for boost but the electronics were a mess. love my ugly 2000s cars. i barely drive it because if it gets hit i will never find the same body kit. but it looks cool lol.
Love the love thats being shown for these old VW's, Possible MK4 VW video in the future?
2:56 so like g35 and take overs
21:52 beeeqS
Are we just ignoring the lowered D21 @11:30 ???
SWEEET!!!
@SpeeedCo I have two 1993 Eurovans with the inline 5 cylinder I will be building at least one out of. Anyone know the super secret formula I have heard about with an Audi head on the Eurovan bottom end? Supposed to make a pretty stout engine ready for booooost...
0:27 as someone who has been here from the beginning, this is really the best part to see for me. It means I’ll keep James in my life for a while longer.
Love y’all James it’s still civic > golf all day.  I do have a soft spot for corrados tho!
Booyah!!!
Brudda, I don't like VW, but I respect your love of them. I was one of the firet fans of non-racing/crawling 1st gen Ranger platform trucks, so I know what it's like tonlove a little vehicle other people just don't understand.  I love fark trucks. I love ranch trucks. What better ranch truck than the one from Malcolm in the Middle?
Bud, you should come to South Africa. Our VW scene is ridiculous, especially the older models. We could buy new Mk 1’s until the mid 2000s.
Hey James I hope you can read this. I just wanna tell you I’ve been a fan for a long time.  I remember in one of your old donut videos you said you love attention and that’s why you were in the comedy business. What you said really enlightened me. I didn’t know a person can proudly say that about themselves and just proudly be themselves like that. It made me started to think why I don’t accept many aspects of myself. Now even though I’m still learning, I can say I’m a more authentic person than before I met you. Thank you.
Is the nord VPN promo only for North American subscribers? I am from Jamaica and I signed up. It worked for a few days then refunded my money and cancelled my membership.
This kind of down-to-earth car talk on both history and repair is why I ever got into Donut in the first place. So happy to see your channel and the guys over at Big Time striving in it!
@5:48 "imported from Germany" (car has Belgium licenceplate)
GOOD
My favourite video so far ❤
Found this channel today because I remembered. Where my "more power baby" guy. Caught up and now I'm "up to speed"
Hello from Mexico  I got an mk2
Hello from Mexico  I got an mk2
"I got my car back from Donut" Huh. So they didn't take the divorce well... 🤫
put a rotary in it james you know you want it jaaaames brap brap brap jaaaaaames
I remember seeing the golf while it was shipping in New Mexico
I feel like Pumpfey is realer and better since he left donut
We were doing that stuff in the mid 70s onward with Datsuns!
James lookin way less bloated, but still splotchy. I hope he's off the sauce and not on ozempic.
Why didnt speed and bigtime just collab?
I agree 100% if it weren't for the Golf, I would have never met my wife, my best friends or have my current job. I hope PVW publishes your car. I was part of PVW photoshoot of my best friends mark 4 Golf TDI and it was a great experience and he still has is Golf today. Good luck and thanks for the content!
Pls dont hype too much they’ll increase in value 😩
do you have a discord?
as a guy that owns a mk5 tdi they are great cars even if you aren't that mechanically inclined.
I don't have a golf but i got a 2010 sportwagon jetta tdi with a manual tans.
So sick that this channel has a project car now
Nice! I'm kinda in a similar situation with my mk6. If repair bill is too high what to do??? (That's the question I have been asking myself)
"My first car was an S13 240SX" Damn... the dream  But like, recently, for whatever reason, I started thinking "Yo, those Golfs are amazing looking." Mk2 and 3 specifically. Every time I see one on the street I'm like "HELL YEAH." I'd love to get one myself, really.
Egg for life
I own 2 golfs, a daily tdi and a weekend R32
I feel that my first vw is what really got my love into cars really started it  was a red 4dr 2.5 golf i now have a mk5 gti
You better get a LSD gearbox with that amount of power. Otherwise you will end up as the king of one tire fires😬
Get that centerfold playboy
I had a golf with a butt😂 2001 2.0 Jetta I think it’s a mk4 bora😅
Gives me hope for my mark 4 jetta I have sitting for 2 years with rust free body but slight knock after a minute of running but no smoke or metal on oil when checking dipstick
Where is the book club discord? Is there a link?
Anyone else notice the community sticker was spelt wrong…? Had to be intended… 👀🤔😂
I had a Golf III VR6 GTI.  Loved it.  Bought it from a guy who build big race semi's.  Had few bolt ons, but was quick and fun to drive.  Doesn't compare to my GT S550, but still a fun corner carver on a nice windy backroad.  I was VWVORTEX too.  Stereoguy was my screenname.  Lived on that site.  I also owned an S13 also with a CA18DET that I tuned to over 340hp and lighted and Porsche fast.  Fully built motor and GT28RS turbo.
being nearly 40 I do love reminesing on the good ol days. I had a 92 Corrado SLC that I could barely afford to make cool--er. I loved the shows/meets/g2g that happened basically 7 days a week. amazing community.
Taking back Sunday! amazing!!!!!!!
I loved my '95 GTI VR6.  All the right nannies and the wookie loved to howl.
I was never on Vortex but I had a wave of nostalgia when you brought that up. RIP Forums 💔
nice job smoking out the shop....
The enthusiasm is palpable. Love seeing someone love what they're doing and why they're doing it.
Its the Civic of VWs
I hope this time he paints the bay before putting in the engine.
Sweet
ngl as someone who has always hated VW after my dad gave me his MK4 Jetta I fell in love with all the VWs from before 05
Hey Canadian here.. James you have kept me entertained with your content both here and when you were with donut... Unfortunately I'm extending my American boycott to American YouTubers.. I know. I'll have no impact. I know I can't avoid all American products. I'm going ahead anyhow. Feel free to roast me in the comments I will not respond.
TDC and Speeed singlehandedly carry the automotive YouTube space. We love you.
I used to think I dislike James on Donut. And not like I hated him just didn’t like his personality. Well turns out Donut somehow made him unlikable because dudes content and the Bigtime boys are that are getting me through the flu.
Could just get a civic. Instead of a  Volksgagon. Lol jk I'm a honda guy and can't help but entertain the idea of a golf
I see your one vw and I raise you 2 dodge omni's
You should review a Z32 300zx next
Best video so far
I’ve been avoiding this video because I knew it would give me the bug again. I miss going to h2oi. Thanks James. Now who’s going to help me convince my wife I need another GTI?
My first car in 2009 was a MK3. Loved this Auto!
In my county Gypsies bought them all and chip tuned them the fuck out and now u cannot buy one for less than 5k (salary is 6k year)
Wheres the Cabrio gang at??
As a VW FAG boy I love this!!! VW is the best! My 2nd car was 04 GLI loved and hated that car mostly loved it! But seriously it did come with its issues but it was so fun and so awesome! Will forever love VW! Especially being a northeast boy with the whole Honda/VW back then lol
My first brand new car was a 1995 Golf mk3 3dr. It was a 1.9 diesel with 64bhp :-)
Hey James. Love your videos. But cannot agree with you on this one. I love in Europe and had mk3 golf. And since then I have avoided any cars by vw group. They are just not good. And the good looking part. Well i know it's subjective but i find golfs as one of the ugliest cars of all time So
This video singlehandedly increased its market price🙃
Jeezus, James looks way older.  Take care of your skin dude. Buy better fitting clothes. Nice car I guess.
Love love love that color
James is not helping the urge to get a MK1 off FB marketplace haha
Just like what girls like, you will be a happier man.
watching this and hearing Whipple mentioned i was like another Whipple in cars that's not making superchargers
As a VW fanatic, gonna show this to all my friends and tell them "SEE I TOLD YOU MY JETTA IS COOL!!"
JAMES eat a cheeseburger for GOD’s sake!! 😮
Damn it James! I have a 3 car garage with only 2 cars. Go away and stop convincing me to buy another VW!! 😅
We need help
How can I send my 2013 Ford Flex Limited AWD twin turbo to you for the ultimate Ford Flex build. The Ford Flex Community is real and we need help. Our transmission is toast at anything above 599 horsepower even though there are turbo upgrades out there that are bringing 600+
‘Too close is close enough’ - Shawn Kemp
As a french dude I saw a lot of polo and golf modified, none of them looked so cool
James you already convicted me to buy a golf mk7 about 10 months ago.
Love the Golf. Another underrated platform imo is the Celica. I would really love to see some high quality St202 6th gen Celica content :)
Bought my daughter a manual 2011 A3, a GTI in disguise, for her first car.  Yes, a teen girl who can drive a stick.  Go Dad! :)
How effing BS is this. Yeah youre so relatable in front of your middle class house. Gimme a break. Youre a millionaire famous person. Call the magazine and tell them you want to be on the cover. Mission accomplished
i already have golf, Increased resale value?? bet
Gonna bring back up to speed???
parts so many parts
Complaining about the intern that dinged the quarter, when you blew up the engine... hahah
The Medium Build hat tells me everything! 🤘
This video is sick
car guys are effing rad
MO POWA BABEH!
PAINT THE BAY 👍🏻
Dope outro
Kids don’t understand that these mk3 golf’s are supercar killers and makes Honda fanboys quiver in fear…
This is the video I've been waiting for from you! Wish I would've kept my MK1 Cabby, but glad I have my MK6 GTI!
What happened to the 240sx?
I have a jetta 3 1.8 carb soon to be vr6 swoped
the discord link isnt working for me
mk3's are really safe actually.
I love this editing style format for your videos! keep up the good work
it's funny how different people see VWs in the US compared to Europe, here they're viewed as one of the least special cars you could own lmao
Oh yeah, but I own a Mk5 sooo.. It would be nice if the mods/fixes would be universal 😂
I legit can’t wait to see this rebuild once it’s all said and done 😁😁
I miss the old donut series from like 6 years ago when you did up the z's and subarus.
two years ago i bought one. mk3 cabrio. for only 200 euro ;)
Sorry to be a .... regular Latvian downer (totally a thing) - but all 5 reasons are wrong (well except maybe for the last one). Reason No. 1. They're cheap YEAH - FOR A REASON. 2. Fun engine options. THE PLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE - HENCE THE DRIVEN WHEELS - IS WRONG (ie. NOT-FUN). 3. They look sick. More like... ill. The red quad-headlight at 08:25 one you call Mark I is ekswhually a Mark II GTI. 4. Community. NAH DUDE - BMW community way better. When you see a BMW - there are two types of people who drive them. TWO types. It's either a Karen who... thinks that she only dates guys with BMWs (without any knowledge what a BMW is) - OR - NUMBER TWO - it's a guy who enjoys cars and enjoys driving. LOTS OF OPTIONS of people driving Golfs. Like... you just don't know who you are going to meet - when seeing a Golf. All types of schizzos could be driving them. In case of a BMW - one of two types. That's it. Reason Number 5. You have one. WELL - good for you, buddy, good for you. So this all was intro. What I ekshwually wanted to say - is it's a real downer you're not reparing your car by yourself. You have a buddy who has a garage who will help you. No one cares, dude, no one. Oh wait.. millions of views... well... You would still be better off reparing the car yourself. Trust me. The Regular Latvian Downer (no it's not my youtube channel name).
That’s why Vw has a special place in my heart
hell yeah 8v (note my name...)
I'm here for it baby
Please do a collab with Mighty Car Mods.
Dammm those stills of the black mk3s ! Brought me back!
You have a Volkswagen R32, I have a Nissan R32. Can we still hang out? R32 Club???
1.9 afn
Love Medium Build
You probably won't see this comment but I photographed your car a few years ago when it was at Eurowise. It's such a beautiful car, well built and yes it made me a believer in the platform. Hope to see it shine again soon!
Where’s the MK2 community I can’t get mine started 👎👎
U should see suzuki swift 2012 india
I own a 96 golf 3, of course it has 1.9 TDI 😏
Right on!👍
Is my boy driving a G wagon he's ballin an has James done a video with big-time yet?
Greetings from Germany! A friend of me got a veeeery similar golf mk3 like you😂 and youre right! I got a golf mk2 Madison and i like that little thing and the passat b5.5 with the 1.9tdi is a really badass too and you can upgrade that engine like a sportswagon.  And Volkswagen build a V10 Diesel in the Pheaton and a V12 Diesel in audis and so on. And why are all these imported US and Japanese cars so expensive here in Germany and our German cars are this cheap in the US sometimes even cheaper like here in Germany 😂  Edit: my mk2 golf was rusty too. Even some holes but a friend of mine is a body mechanic and he welded my whole car so it's like new. I give him a car for that. A VW Polo Mk3 6n2 with that fully electric fabric roof.
Nice fake channel bro, the entire thing is botted
I own a Scirocco R. Used to shit on VWs until I owned one, now I can't get enough of them!
Man I LOVE my MK7 who fell in love with a MK2 my dad was working on for a customer when I was a kid. It's what led me to eventually working for a VW dealership out here in VA.
Dude! My 97 k2 driver door doesn't shut either! And it's almost impossible finding an assembly!
I had a Jetta 2.5 which I would’ve still been driving, it was straight piped so it sounded dope. But unfortunately my brother blew the trans on it when I gave it to him :(
my 2nd car was a mk3 97 vr6 i still miss it then i had  a 2000 mk4 vr6 i miss that one too lol
i got one of these 🔥🔥 an it is amazing 😍😍
feel the same way about my dc5 chassis, its a base model auto so it has the shit engine and a terrible auto to boot and my car has a lot of wheel well rust that has gone almost completely thru the frame but i cant bring myself to get a new chassis, gonna cut the rust out weld in some new metal and shape it and then ill essentially 02-04 type s swap the car, k20a2 (eventually want to go boosted) with the 6 spd manual with kpro.
Love seeing you and car content!
0:15 “replica” lol  The only thing that those 2 cars have in common is the color
You got a subscribe from me
I got 2 MKIV GTI projects. LET'S HANG!!
You guys want to have a golf as a project? Hell I want to drive a Golf as normal car. Maybe a better sound system thats it. Those cars a reliable and were really made fot the Volk. No way in hell I can afford a golf 8. Give me a golf 3 or 4 and I'm happy.
Really hope your right about the value! I have been holding onto fenders, hoods, hatch's and doors for ever! I think I have all the interior dash as well. Ugh such a hoarder... Good luck with your build!!
The first Golf still looks amazing because it was designed by Giorgietto Giugiaro. Italian design is timeless
0:13 „replicated“? are you sure? This build is by JP performance from germany and it is not a copy of anything. It isn’t finished yet, but that thing started years ago, wich you can see on the channel. They ended up to use only very few parts of the body, everything else is 100% custom built. That thing is far from a replica of your stock golf.  I mean look at the picture you posted… there is an engine behind the front seats.
and after that video the prices for Golf is skyrocketing))🤣🤣🤣
I dont have a golf but I have a 83 rabbit caddy hope we can still hang out
You had me @ vw, subscribed
I feel u bro 🙁🙁🙁 I miss my vr6 jetta soooo bad   https://youtu.be/H07CsEOH2y8?si=XD55Xs9e0GJex_5K
In 2001 my first and second car was a Golf Mk3 1.8L, I modified the second one with a G60 (I live in the EU), I love these cars. Unfortunately in most European countries it is now illegal to drive them in and around cities (low emission law) and modifications are very regulated (impossible). Europe sucks...
Not that anybody asked, but so happy James mentioned my favorite band lol
Got a Mk5 GTI because all of you guys, I'm struggling to find a replacement really worth the money and the ones that really are, are another mk5 GTI underneath: Scirocco R 265, TTS 272 and Audi S3 265. The S1 is even very viable. I'm considering Fiesta ST and i20N too but to me the ultimate car would be a i30N 280 Fastback. Otherwise probably keeping the GTI and modify it even further for road daily use. Unless I'll end up with a Swift Sport 140
Thank god I bought my 2 door 2011 mfi golf for 1350 before this
Hello from Poland I already have the second one and I'm thinking about buying the third one mk3
First car I ever bought for myself was a 1995 GTI VR6. I fucking miss that car. 😭 Now I drive an Evo V.
LET'S GOOOO!! 🫶🏻
I have a 3.5 cabrio golf that’s been parked for like 6 months this video has definitely give me the big to sort it ready for summer I am uk based
2.5l?! Dude, i cant...DO NOT USE ONE! THEY ARE ONE OF THE WORST ENGINES VW HAS EVER MADE. GET A 1.8T AND PROVE YOU'RE A MECHANIC
Mk3's? Nah...mk4's are where the lines are at imo.
I actually got a VR6 98’ Golf because of all of the cool stuff that you guys did on Donut! Got it during the pandemic, finally got it to start, and haven’t worked on it since 😂
VW is cool Freiburger JR. you are so right….. to make it special put the damn VW V8 in it……  VW ea898 3958 ccm Turbo loaded approx 320 kw….plussssss
You're so skinny James! My man looks ready for a warddrobe update. all  those old baggy clothes hiding all that hard work.
i had a mk5 jetta tdi loved that car
always loved the look of the 88 GLI Jettas
I am glad to see James getting back to car content, although I miss the humor, pizzazz, and energy that he bled through his veins. The UpToSpeed love and humor that he used to convey just isn't the same on this platform. I used to be a die hard Humphrey fan but after he left Donut, I wonder if we will see the same man that won a Streamy and changed the channel forever because he put it into the stratosphere. Only time will tell..... we're waiting James please show us more because after the Grand Tour has ended we are all waiting for you to enter that realm. You deserve it, so go apply now! That's where you belong! JAMES PUMPHREY GRAND TOUR 2026 SEASON 1!
I think its funny james has a dodge tattoo😂
Also the Honda scene started the shaved bay/tucked wire  look.
I'm a fan of you but I honestly don't agree , the Honda Civic is the most bang for ur buck project car. Aftermarket support is still insane for a 30 year old vehicle. And you can damn near swap any Honda engine in it
Had the vento (your imperials called it Jetta and forgot to give Jessie front breaks)  Both sine panels was rustet out so of with the shit in with 1.5mm inder panel, vendes in 2 45° bend istedet of 90°.  3mm Vertical struktur and outer panel in 1.5mm Bended in 3 30° bends and some bracing between the vertical and outer panel. Welded it together.  Did i over do it? 😅
Took the Donut microphone as well on the way back 😂
Sills are rusty on one of my 97 Midget IIs :-( gutted.
"Might as well" is how my 89 B2000 ute went from 80 hp to 400hp, and one day, 550hp. Hate head gasket failures, will 16v swap it. If I'm going to 16v swap it I might as well turho it. If I'm going to turbo it it might as well be a big one. Holset HE351CW from a rolled near new 98 ram :-D
Big end bearings...
Every one knew it was rod knock but James. Oh my sweet boy.
"Old volkswagens" LOL - how dare you say that to an owner of a 70 Variaht, 61 bug, 54 oval bug. Respect your elders, especially the Variant which has a built engine :-D
I have a mk7 golf r. First VW I have ever owned. First European car I've ever owned and I've had 20+ cars and I absolutely love it. I fell in love with it. I also joined the local VW Facebook group after I went to a car show. Every one was super cool and nerdy and welcoming. There really wasn't a group like that with any other car I've ever owned.
7:44 2.5 for life
Where is the money option here to help out with the project?
If you go to Mexico City or the state of Puebla is all about VW, great car community there.
Dubbin87 was my Vortex name. Still have my 96 VR6 Jetta. Daily driving a B5 A4 now.
You're a looney, Bro.
18 minutes before doing anything to the car in a 22 min video feels bad man.
Jetta wagons where it’s at long golf for the win 🙏
*sigh* I have too many cars. I'm a Subaru guy... 2024 Forester Wilderness, 2005 STi, 2002 WRX, 1999 MX-5, and a 1998 Ram 3500... But I'll eat it and guy buy a Golf... because James owns one. :)
Holy shit, VW is so expensive in the US. In Europe you can find mint condition, 30k mileage for $4k. And that's the upper limit of the price range. $1-2k is pretty standard
Not me staring past the tv thinking about h2o 😢
I only like their commercial with Peter Stormare.
If you want a great deal on a mk3 look around the salvage yards. My daily driver was rust free and arrow straight just sitting in a yard. 4 years and 75k miles later I couldn't think of a better car to save. I am looking forward to seeing how this turns out. VWvortex is still alive with some excellent mk3 restoration projects being documented right now.
Currently working on my mk3 cabrio, also have a tired mk 3 golf. Really excited for new mk3 content
Holy crap I finally found you guys!
James, always loved you dude, so excited you're getting this ball rolling again. Been a big VW guy and part of 07k following for a minute now. So glad to watch this car come back to life. 🤙🏼
Love the VW Golfs... but the MK3 was not the greatest! the MK4 was the worst! Mk1 or 2 all the way! Super light weight and super fun before they added all the extras and weighed them down!   VW's rule and all the people that own them too! The community is a strong and friendly bunch!! Im still a member on a Mk1GTi website from the Uk I joined when I was 17 (Im now 41!!)... It still going strong and they have meets all the time and I get invites to them!
Guys what's the discord link invite?
My mom had a MK2 Golf back in the mid 2000’s I’d say around 2004 that same year I went into Mexico and there was some nice clean MK2’s everywhere and I mean everywhere and ever since I ended up liking them then a cousin of mine years later bought a golf gti and it too was a fun car!
The price has already skyrocketed!  I bought an 01 gti in 2016, rust free from Cali here in Mi.  $3000 with 145000 miles.  All the golfs you find under 3k are clapped out now.  All these videos do is reach the people that are clapping them out then making them think they have a gold mine…
my mk4 is a fun little car but god it hates me
I had 2001 Jetta TDI. 6spd. Bought it with 86,000kms and sold it with 365,000kms. It was a tank. I miss the smell of crayons  #IYKYK
I love James!!!
Talk about crankcase blow by Jesus Christ....
Don't worry about the rust just put some ramen noodles in it. It'll be fine.
I can attest as a 2013 VW GTI (MK6) owner.. These cars are absolute gold if you can keep up with maintaining them. Huge aftermarket support, tons of fun, and beautiful all around. It’s sad to think they’ll be gone soon😢
i miss prime vwvortex
Heck yeah let’s go!!!! Let me know if you need anything for it.
#4 AKA Family
I miss Waterfest
I'm rocking a b4 passat manual vr6 as a daily currently. Love vws.
I love my mk6 gti and my 08 Jetta 2.5! Thanks for the great video!!
Das Auto von JP ist kein Replika sondern ein ganz ganz anderes und höheres Level.
LFA swap
I’ll take a MK1,2,4,6 any day. But my love started when I was 5 riding around in a 1974 Super Beetle convertible. My first VW was (and still is) a 71 Super Beetle convertible but I have owned 20 VWs from a MK1 TD to a MK6 GTi.
I'm currently building my mk4 GTI VR6, I'm glad it's getting cool now.
I thought Honda was. 👍
This is one of the reasons I follow you! The VW content! I own a mk3 golf with a butt 😂 the VW community is still strong and people like you keep it going!
I got my project! 2010 golf 2.5 5cyl with 5spd manual 🎉
Pushing that car uphill in wallaby’s!?!? James got MO POWAAAHHH BABAYY
Car project bros were the first crypto pump and dump bros.
So put vr6 in it👌
Personally I was never a fan of German cars. And when I moved to Canada for work from India, the first car I went for a test drive was a tuned 2005 Subaru WRX STI and that was the kind of power I have never experienced in my life with a 1.6L Suzuki. I loved the experience but did I want it, I was confused. The next one I saw was a 2008 Volkswagen Golf MK5 R32. I drove the thing and 15 minutes later, the car was mine. I didn't think twice and that was exactly the experience I wanted. Whatever you said about the Golf was absolutely true! I need to hear that VR6 noise at least for 10 minutes everyday. These are living things on 4 wheels and a perfect cure if you're having a bad day. Loved this video and I am looking forward to seeing that beautiful MK3 back on the road soon.
ohhh a broken plastic part enthusiast here!
Hat der grad ehrlich gesagt JP Performance hat ihn kopiert @JPPerformance
The Volswagen Gulf has been relevant for 4 decades or more. My buddy had an '88 gti, orange. Sick little car. He was an amateur mechanic and blew it up, but it was fun while it lasted.
My buddy is a VW specialist; best around my area.  He says he loves VW because they make him so much money.
It's true! I hate myself for this tho but my first car was a VW type 2 but it got sold the day I bought it with my mom - because the transmission broke on the way back... lol Had a Lupo and then later a Subaru WRX. After that it got serious and I started drifting with my AE86 (later on with 4agZe).  And then also a S13 with RB25det. Best cars I owned in my life - the last 2.
Those fog lights are sweet. Where do I get them🔥🔥🔥
Awwww yeah
Makes me what to get my 97 Jetta out of the barn and fixed up.  54k original
The emotions you can feel from this video is 10000% genuine. The excitement from that past you seeing dreams become reality, the nervousness and anxiety of potentially having to start from a clean slate, the passion really emits from this video and it feels so good to see james in his happy place 🙏. Thank you for giving us the inside look at the craziness you call your life 😎👌
Anyone else can't watch this except on a phone? Tried multiple platforms
I've never seen anyone so confidently wrong. Every "trend" he named started off on mini-trucks.
The price on mk3's are already insane, so I doubt you talking about them is going to make it that much worse.
My dream build is a turbo 07K MK1! One day🙌
Definitely won’t be convincing people to buy VWs 😂
I don't have a Golf, but I also got a two-door hatch that is under appreciated. Can we still hang out?
Please explain Siamese twin skit😂
Don’t forget the V5 engine (technically VR5) they put in the VW Golf
Heck, I gotta get my golf cabrio running again... ;_;
Being a huge MK3 fan i agree VWs are where its at and definitely worth buying one.  If you are going for 500 HP are you sticking with bags (depending on brand/quality) or some KW v3 coilovers? The color is fantastic! Slick top for the win! I love my MK3 Gold Variant, and honestly those looking shouldn't shy away from importing with the help of Open Air Imports!
As a dutch person our cars all look deepfried on the bottom
My first car was a mk 3 golf drove that thing to 250 and it hurt to have to sell the thing. Watching the intro made me wanna cry man miss that car to this day. Hope to one day get back into another one
Ah the work horse of the Balkans.
Queria que aqui no Brasil fosse fácil essas alterações mecânicas. No Brasil a comunidade do Golf Mk3 é muito forte.
okay imma get my cabrio running again
nice
32 year old maryland local here. h2oi was like nothing else... can confirm
Did James get less fat?
Honestly, the Golf is NOT something i would buy. Theres a bazillion of them, and most of them look the same, even when "tuned". They dont look amazing to me and thus i cant see myself like or love them. That being said, i do love your passion for yours. And seeing that rust, dents and non closing door, hurts me as a car lover. It sucks to see a car like that.
does a B4 passat count?
sooo why did you quit donut?
Where I used to study, they actually have 2 golfs rn. And one of the golfs, I learned to change a timing belt on for the first time. It was a beater MK3 Golf that they bought for cheap for his wife to fix up.
I have a 1995 GTI VR6 with 30k miles. It’s just sitting in my garage. I’d let it go if someone made me an offer. It’s basically all stock.
i love golfs. there is no better car i have a MK6
Spun bearing or scored cylinder, mozzle do an engine swap; mozzle
From Donut? that MK3 just depreciated RIP
I will say you did actually change my perspective on watercooled VWs a good bit with this video, but i will say in my personal opinion once they got to MK5.. the aesthetics just lost me
Polo 6n2 gti is the shit
In 2006 my dad made me buy a 86 nissan truck 2wd that was in a barn. It didnt even have a seatbelt in it so my dad put 2 self tapping screws in a strap and told me to throw it over my shoulder no cop will pull me over if i did that and want know the difference lol. So what you mean most young kids parents want let them get a old vehicle because its to dangerous😂
I had the mk2 golf with 2.0 16v. Sold it around 2011. Was on vwvortex forum from the early 2000s
Dark Mater was good. Recursion gets a bit tedious but still also worth reading.
Hey James! I have a mk4 golf project! It was originally a 2.0 gasser and I swapped it to an ALH 1.9 diesel. Upgraded the turbo to a vnt17, stage 2 clutch and currently a stage 1 Malone tune. My goal is to upgrade it to esentially an R32 but as a diesel version. Mk4 TDR
As a fellow mk3 & mk4 owner/enthusiast.... im just wondering how the fuqqq the blue painters tape didn't remove the marker off the whiteboard!!!!???? 😮
Only thing wrong with the 2.5 is that oil builds up in the intake manifold over time and ruins the sensors there causing the transmission to shift wonky. A quick cleaning of the intake manifold and sensor fixes the issue.
turns out that this is mostly about a guy's face?
Great looking car don’t get me wrong but FUCK working on any VW.
Few patch panels and it'll be good as used
Anybody ever done a oil filter housing on a 14 q7 struggling
Junk it's not worth the effort. It's got no decent factory performance parts. And why's available is scrap.  I bought a 2001 Chevy Cavalier. I know I know caviler??? Wait a minute 225hp all factory 2.4l  01 Z24?? Yeah A fast N/A J body all engine an NO boost stock.. don't buy German boat a anchor. Buy american and you won't be disappointed. I know there's a lot of hate on the quad 4 variance but to be 200 horsepower on less than 2.5l na isn't bad. And again this is all before 6,500 RPM. I have run a quad 4 is up to 11000 RPM at 325hp. . . I can boost this well over a thousand horsepower with forced nduction. I can add over 100 horsepower on a 2.4 with a factory blower. With tune is actually has about 150. For a reliable 300hp. My favorite thing was to look at Camaro and mustangs an smoke em.
Mk3 my favorite generation.  Definitely need another
You compare your piece of dirt with a piece of art? WTF boy you have a problem.. you know that you are talkin bs... you are now copying jp's mk3.... did not like that at all...
I love golf but in my country a 2018 Golf GTI with 30k on ODO costs $60k
Maybe time for a garage tour also. Curious about the G wagon and the e30
This channel is going to be something awesome!  Vw guy here. Own mk1-mk7 currently 😂
Commuinity! 😂👍
I don't think there's a better platform than the Golf platform, honestly. I mean you can even swap an Audi RS3 turbo five cylinder into a Golf Alltrack wagon. They are the LEGO of cars, you can do almost anything!
Amazing to see this car again.^^  But it pisses me off that @youtube thicks I need the german audio track because I'm from germany. ...
Love you buddy, but there's zero chance I'm buying post-war German engineering. They milked their engineers dry during the war and ever since they have been churning out spaghetti monsters of engineering. I'd rather work on my Ford all day long than one of them.
One of my Favorite books!!!
👍😎
you literally did nothing in this video... SUCH A WASTE OF MY MORNING
James and the mk3 community is the most either the most beautiful gay love story or dudes being bros forever type story. I can’t decide which but I love that for you! 😂
I melted the throttle body in my MKV Jetta when the radiator died on me but that inline 5 cylinder "baby Audi" engine has some potential as a popular project car. They aren't reinforced like the newer Audi ones but you can definitely find some overhead in the direction of the modern VW 2.0T power levels.  My 2009 had a flat 175/175 HP/TQ that a local tuner shop was thinking they could get up into the low to mid 200s on stock parts. Even at stock power it had a nice little power band without the turbo, you could feel it on fresh oil and full tank. Saw a guy on YT air bagged one with custom wheels and ride height....such a sweet looking body with the rounded angles.  All that being said to back up the point James made in the video that MK3 and MK4 might be too old for modern safety standards. Those MKVs come with leather and heated seats and a fully built mechanical transmission. Good platform.
James, you should start a trend of calling it a Folkswagon, for obvious reasons! 🚗
My Golf Mk1 standing strong at over 600k km already, no problems, no rust, perfect condition, I'm just too broke rn to engine swap it and mod it, it only has a custom steering wheel and suspension for now, a little lowered, but not slammed, it's my daily and will stay my daily until the day I die, I love that car so much, every ride is like the first one, feels like you're back in the 80s
That's awesome, I worry parts are going to start getting hard to get but at least the aftermarket is strong with one.
Mk3 is the shittiest and most prone to rot golf
Bro you wear CLARkS???   Wicked… I rate you more now. American don’t wear Clarks shoes I’m amazed
Nice G-Wagon James
I am so excited to see this project happen.
I remember VWvortex from back in the day Still miss my 86' Jetta Wolfsburg brown on brown tweed with the 5 speed Had to let her go because we had a kid and they ain't the safest 🥲
Can’t wait to see this progress, I own harlequin # 10 and I’m currently build a vr to swap in. An 07k would be sick though
Loved the vortex and my green goblin 8v gti 4bulb
I agree but the gmt 400 is more bang for your buck
i got a beetle project and it is soooo much work because of previous owner neglect
I Have two 1.9tdi and 1.9td mk3
The golf of theseus
I am very excited to see where this goes
Feels like watching the best series in YouTube
I have an 2004 golf 1.9 diesel my girl hates it lol but she loves my mk6 gti ❤
Nord vpn helps me get back on the hub? I’m never kicking this addiction lol
I still dream about my first car, the '95 GTI Vr6. So low i had to replace my drain plug every oil change. It made me the man I am today (for the better or the worse)
as much as i like your bringing this car back i’ve also been saving for one and if the price goes up im blaming it on you😭😂
Ahh cruising with a packed car listening to TBS, those were the days.
Shouldn't have been concerned, those 2.5s are indestructible! Love that engine.
Minitruckers moving to VWs made the VW scene what it was.  Stretched wheels,  shaved bays,  motor swaps,  body mods, slammed or bagged,  interior etc.
Dude, all the time just felt that you own Donut, all those years. Looking at the number of views at your latest videos... That's now a confirmation. Love from the EU
welcome to east europe, where every teenager's first car is a golf mk3 that will be tuned on a budget
@13:55 In the Real Estate Business in Texas, we called it “while we’re at it”. Made me smile to learn another term for what my dad taught me.   Keep up the great videos. Been working on implementing my own rules since I watched your video.
My first car was an mk4 I got for free from my dad. The engine failed not too long ago but it had over 300 thousand km and I loved it till the very end
I never liked Donut but I’m giving James a chance 👍
vr6 powa!
I absolutely think the car scene needs to go back to the way it used to be.  Instagram/Facebook ruined it, along with the 2008 financial crisis.
I think we need a 1.9 tdi build.
wanna go to Germany and pick me up a VR5 ill buy you one as well i just cant go to Germany! first one i imported was blown
"Girls liked them."  Boy, if you were in Europe and you drive a VW a girl will cross on the other side, just so she could be as far away from you as possible.
I miss forums
Ive got an 87 golf mk1 gti cabby i did a video on it and about to do an update on the channel and this video popped through my head the "might aswell engine" in the update i talk about it love watching your videos james and dont watch donought anymore as its not the same now.
my neighbor has a golf truck it confused the heck out of me but I think it's cool.
James, think about this (this is basically the project i finished...and sold when my kid was born, so i could have a bigger car, also project at the moment :D) : 2008 polo, 1.4tdi .  Sounds crazy to modify them, but it's incredibly  rewarding and quite unique. Had the BNM engine (keep away from BMS code) , 70 hp. Changed injectors(AL code), fitted bigger turbo(1749VA), strongflex all around except dogbone (would'v rattle like crazy with that), changed the seats to red leather alfa 147, JDD gearbox with axles and mounts(stock has a tiny disk and low ratios -192kmph topspeed. JDD has the tallest of them -260kmph topspeed ).  Ended up at 149.9 hp and 341 nm...good amount of torque steer and smiles. This build costs pennies, it's simple to do and it's sooo different from anything else.  These (modified) are very rare in EU also, but i dont think you would find any in the US...plus great mpg (i was averaging around 5-6L/100km, that's about 40-50mpg). If you want pics or info, just contact me :D. I did all my research and the fella that tuned it is the same that has the current WR for 402m on this engine ...11s, 290hp+nos  (you can search for "blue arosa")  Also, good job with the channel! Greetings from Romania!
You forgot to mention the vr5 engine😠
GTI TCR❤
I’m surprised the marker didn’t come off the whiteboard when you took the tape off. Great vid and editing,keep them coming!
What do you think of the new beetles 98-2010? Aren’t they just like GOLF’s ?
I know a 3rd thing it's never been. 1. Documented 2. Finished 3. Cool
Bullshit. Seriously? You entered this thing is car shows? 😂😂😂 wtf why?
Please don't raise the prices of these things man they are so slept on by people, let the vws stay cheap and we still have such a strong community lol. Ive made so many friends with my 88 scirocco going to shows its been great but rich kids dont need to find them lol😊
You lost me at Golf. Hands down my nightmare car and after owning a few found they are great by name more than substance. Best of luck with your endeavours.
Oh shit! Dark matter is a great book lol
bro i loved my vr6 miss selling it every day
I'm a jetta fan
Watching you driving on the freeway and talking with both hands at once is taking years off my life, bro LOL
7 years ago you were alot wider... not the car.    To many chicken nuggets.  😊
I had a 81 rabbit 25 years ago. Man I loved that car. So fun to tinker with.
Took 53 seconds for me to be convinced to start a golf project
I love all VW’s, I’m a VW girl! My first car (still have it) was a 65’ bug back in 05’. I also now have a 2014 R-line turbo bug! So happy to see this 💜
i have a rabbit
i miss my mk5 it was my baby
NICE COLOR BROTHER !!
James Is The Only Reason I Watched Donut
Merge with Zack and Job already.
super jell
God I miss the old H2O days :(
I didn’t realize I wasn’t a fan of donut I was a fan of James and his style
And, with that any hope of me finding a Golf for a reasonable price (again) has gone completely out the window.  LOL  I wanted to get an AE86 Corolla in 1997, then Initial D got popular.   After that I started looking for a Cooper Mini.  Then BMW bought the rights and announced "The MINI is back!", and screwed me again.  Now the Golf, my first car ever, is going to be ruined.  Thanks for that.
Something with the video looks weird. Almost as if you are green screamed in. Maybe turn saturation and coloring down?
Sad I’m selling my mk6 gti soon manual coupe it’s pimp
I had a 98 k2 model loved it
Who is the “bald red guy” he’s talkin about?😂😂
Bro oh my god I’ve literally been begging and waiting for some golf mk4 and mk3 videos my girlfriend thinks I’m actually insane being this hyped
My first car was an 01 GLS I got for $4500. I had it for 6 months, and it was by far my favorite car I owned. A drunk driver ended up totaling it in my driveway, and his insurance gave me 9k for it. I keep telling myself when my kids get older and I have project car money I'm buying another Mk4.
Love your car. I remember when Jamie brought it in. I helped fix a few things on it before he did his cross-country trip in it.
Getting a Jetta and will itasha wrap it in Teto
I believe VWs are great cars up to 80k miles
Bro, James you're looking so much better dude. Like, you look healthy, happy, i love it.
VW's are the most tuned cars here in Brazil
I don’t think it would wanna hangout with my Volkswagen.  It was once a Jetta now it’s closer to being a truck of some sort
I owned a diesel stick mark3 in highschool it was one of the best cars i ever owned, too bad there are so few of them left in decent condition in canada cause of the weather
Bald jokes are the best jokes. Super funny.
Ls swapped golf
20:50 lil guy just hangin’ on
I do really like the VWs but stancing a car is the stupidest thing ever, not to mention ugly.
As a vw guy mine range from a 57 oval bug a 67 DC transporter and the so many damn water cooled vw.   From mk1 up to my mk5 TDI   currently building a mk3 tdi swap into my mk1 rabbit with a Frankenstein 5 speed transmission.    The best thing that happened to me happened a few years ago.   My 84 Jetta ended up in a pvw mag double page from the vw at the lake in Maryland at the food stop during the show.    I look forward to seeing your car in pvw and the restoration of your beloved VW.
I’m with you, but after driving a rwd I just don’t think I can go fwd again.
The only good VW are 60's & 70's bug & bus
I dream of owning an r36 Passat wagon one day
"I don't care what some bald, red guy told you on the internet, it DOES matter what girls like." <-Sage wisdom  And nice, glad I found your channel. I've missed your approach to car vids.
I speeed myself
My first cars were bugs and a Ghia, but later I had a Scirocco and then an 84 GTI. What a great little car. Several friends had them or rabbits and they have always been tough and fun.  It would be fun to have another Golf.
No thank you.
Could you please talk about  the the volvo c30 t5 👉👈🥺
Happy for you, my man!
song @10:34?
If you can explain how to make the wiring not a problem then I am on board!
so hyped for this build
You've gotta get a t shit with a picture of  a Jetta with a caption "just a golf with a butt!"
i cant access the discord :/
VR6 prices just went up 😢
"What other company offers you V6 four-cylinder turbo engines and diesel engines?" BMW has variants of straight 6 engines, diesel straight 6 engines, and 4 cylinder turbo engines, as a matter of fact a lot of companies have a lot of variants lol
Huuugee thank you for making this video, I own a 1988 w124, there's rust that worries me very much, countless stuff that needs replacing, seeing this video has taken some weight off my heart because there's been so many points where I've thought about it being the best to sell my ride but I never could, it's my first car and it's special. Got my full support with this epic Lil golf.
this video comes not even 2 months after I buy a pos chevy, wish I had seen this sooner :(
Instructions unclear. Got an EG6. What do?
Didn't they do a V5 in the mk4 as well?
Nope volvo get a volvo project 850R
"I don't care what some...bald.....red guy on the internet told you. It does matter what girls like!" Truer words have not been spoken in an age, my friend! 🤘
Sorry to tall for a golf
Looking lean after cutting out the donuts!
Dude, I’ve got a mk7 (1.4TSI) and a 7.5 (eGolf) as well as a V6 Eurovan and a Mini R53 and a 2CV. I only ever had one mk3 and that was a 1.6 Vento (Jetta) and loved VWs ever since.
Dude vw vortex was permanently open on my desktop from 14-20 years old.
mk4 is my dream car and i will have it soon hehe😈
wtf? I have you know I put the first set of Newspeed  coil overs on a water cooled Bug. It was showed at 'On the Green" VW car show ,  by  Randy's Stuff, Colorado. I worked for Randy! ,    with Love, Old Bald red guy.... sheesh, don't dis the air cooled crowd ether. Anyways, carry on...
Holy sh... this is the car that made me sub to the other one
I got a Mazdaspeed 3 but y'all got dudes are chill.
if only i knew where i can get my mk5 2.0t engine rebuilt in Vegas 🤧😭
Mk3 vr6 is the one
I've got an MK7 which is my daily/somewhat project ride!
Pumphrey brining back the Clark Wallabies
Us the discord/book club free? I think id love a book club
I had an 02 jetta tdi. I now know I could have fixed it easily, but I sold it to a friend when it wouldn't start anymore. I'm okay with having sold it, though. They needed a safe car, since one of their dailys had rotted out. I borrowed a car from my parents for a month (total beater with no heat in wisconsin February lmao) and then just bought a subaru. That said, I loved that jetta. It'd be fun to he part of the golf community
F donut. I’m glad I found the new channel
My first car was a 1996 Golf GL that I learned how to drive stick on. I wanted to buy my first car again and have searched for years but I cant find these things anywhere without them getting bought up. It’s even more difficult to find them un-modded. Clapped out, lowered with turbos accompanied by ridiculous prices because of the “parts” put into them. I loved these cars for the soul fact that they are practical and reliable but seeing videos like this makes me realize why im having such a hard time. I’m in the midst of an increasing market around a vehicle that I thought no one cared about. I moved into my first place with my 4DR Golf and now it’s daunting on me that ill be undoing some douche’s dream just to get it back to stock. Im glad for your success but I hate what it has done to buying a simple and reliable car.
cool vid but maybe at least have 50% of the video being about the car instead of story and background?
hey James love the vid can you do a vid on the vw12 concept car pis.
Hi, James. Fellow Kentuckian here. Have you ever considered doing more acting in the future? Thanks.
i miss webforums, the Tex was amazing.
I just bought a 2008 Rabbit for $500 and this video just solidified my feelings on this great purchase
Loving the mention of forums. The kids don't know about Vortex/Hondatech/NASIOC/EvolutionM
As he drives around in a G wagon
Calling JP's Golf Project calling "Replicated" is kinda weird. Just saying.
Not the H2Oi feels trip I thought was coming today... <3
So so so stoked to see this! My dad and I are currently working on both a Mk2 and Mk3 VW Gol (Brazilian version of the Golf), absolutely love these cars!
0:15 I’m not sure if the mk3 from JpPerformance is the right picture to say it’s been replicated 😂 his thing got a V10 R8 engine on the rear axle the only thing u can say is close to your car is the color and the roof 😂 but still love both cars ❤️
The are cheap because ALL german cars are over engineered and over priced 🗑️ and will cost you twice as much to fix when it inevitably breaks as any Japanese car... 💯 🤷‍♂️ ✌️
Still would love a VR6 Corrado manual
Why did we stop seeing you in donut chanel u were my fav😅
dude had my 05 MK4 for 5 years I bought it for 2 grand it had 148 on the clock mint. 2 years ago after dropping 8 grand into it someone ran me off the highway only 2 months of me getting it back. it was running and looked the best it ever had. Now I have a 2020 WRX but miss my VW almost everyday James glad to see you get to keep her going.
Won't lie, as an OCLocal I miss the earlier days of h2oi until it went full takeover lol.
NICE!!! I can't wait to see it!
IBL
In South Africa this car, or any VW would get stolen right after you slap some new shoes on it
Shout out to Ocean City!
Interesting video , but also funny as being in Europe I would never thought about this car as cool or interesting. Just a car that I saw bunch of everyday, I think I still see them here, but usually in very bad condition.
All cool and all. Problem is I don’t like golf.
The cars from 60s are best there the coolest. Period!!!
I'm in my mid 30s, and I grew up in England. Golfs were THE boy racer douchebag car lol. Everyone hated them because all the teens with a little money would supe them up and go nuts. Or would do nothing but give it an obnoxious and illegal exhaust and just SOUND insane while doing 0-60 in like 13 seconds lol. I have nostalgia for them, even though I was only an observer of them as a teen.
I'm going to need a Moog from Mighty Car Mods crossover. He loves Volkswagens and has built several.
Man.. seeing the car and James. The nostalgia. 🩵
As someone who owned an 80 VW Rabbit as my first car Age 16, Had a diesel in it to begin, Swapped an 83 GTI Rabbit 1.8 into her, a 5 speed from a vw cabriolet and the body kit from the Cabriolet. I drove that car for over 10 years as my daily. Sadly life moved on and she became unreliable and I believed it was time to move on. I had most upgrades on the car that were bolt on including a custom Cold Air for the DIS system, probably didn't help much but I loved the sound. Sadly I let her go to scrap. I've owned a 944, MR2 and several cars since and I still miss my Rabbit. Sadly I don't have the time to start over and being in Cali really kills the drive to own one now because of the smog laws. I would kill to have another Rabbit.
I have the Same pos on my lift rn, Rusty af
Yessss!! I cant wait to get back on my mk3 project
If Jamie Orr can put a junkyard mk3 harlequin back together, you can put this mk3 back together.
I love my 97 5 speed. Easy to work on for the most part and you cant kill it. Just a little more rusty than yours.
Does the algorithm prefer when I instantly like the video upon start, or does it prefer for me to watch the entire video without any scrubbing and like at the very end of the video?
Ngl there's nothing you can tell me that'll convince me to buy a VW, but I'd still like to hang haha
TBS!
You are the reason I got a Golf. My R has been a blessing in my life.
The excitement in James’ voice when he said “we got a project car on our hands, fellas!” was infectious. Best of luck, bro! I’ll be following along!
What's the hardest part about owning a VW Gulf? Telling your parents that you're gay.
Wrong, wrong, wrong the Mk2 is the superior Golf. 😁
I’ve found that cars and brands are discontinued have the best community
Im going to get one but the convertible version of it
RIP H2Oi :(
Love the mk3 golf ❤ respect and luv from Uk 🇬🇧
1.9 PD engine because who cares about horsepower when you have torque and reliability.
Can you tell us more about what that engine is called please
Waaaaaaaaaay ahead of you. I own two well… technically 1 because the other is an R32 but still. I got the GTi when I was 16. I’m 38 now. It has been my daily driver and my passion project. Such an amazing amazing car.
Please USA, dont discover brazilian Gol scene........... we dont need more inflation
If a Jetta is a Golf with a butt, a CC is a Golf with a BBL 😂😂
Does a CC VR6 count…?
A 97 golf was my first car, and that funky maroon color. What if like to know, is which planet those rs3 engines go for 500?? When i look it up they are asking full car price.
Nah i actually prefer the Rabbit, but the only issue is I’m 6’2”…
Is this the same guy that's in Donut? He seems more chill, like a normal cool dude.
Worth mentioning that the VW Diesel 4s had a whole dedicated community just to themselves, soooo much information readily available out there and on youtube! My first car was an 06 TDI Jetta, I miss it so much
Here in South Africa K24 swapped Golfs and TDI motors as well running big boost
Dang
Crazy to leave Donut then still milk their name for your titles.
"i love this channel" at the end melted my heart. You seem so genuinely stoked and happy to have the wheel back in your hands, and it excites the hell out of me. Cant wait for more on this one!
Bring back bumper to bumper but make it car magazine to car magazine
James, I would like to raid your closet
3:15 WHAT Yooou knOOOw about DaT yooU dOnt KnOW nOTHiNG ABOUT dat.
“Might as well” always escalates way too quickly
"Might as well" = "While you're there"
If @BrianScotto doesnt like this video im gonna go crazy
That’s what I don’t understand. Vw is huge in tunning outside the us but today you almost don’t see them here in us specifically modified ones
I've watched this guy so much that I knew what the number 5 was before showing 😂
plz dont that a real shit box
Finally donut media is bringing us back original content
I love my 93 CL eu spec with 1.6 55kW, my friends are saying that is garbage (yes it is) but it looks great to me and I want to make it a bit cleaner with some bigger better engine
Unfortunately old vw’s are already overpriced
K swap
Go to RSA,stop while you can bro,you ain't ready for seeing the same VW around every corner,it's sickening
I got a 2009 Gti for sale if anybody wants to start a project
NGL.. I just want the mech TDI boosted for a Suzuki Sidekick..
Gotta go to wolfsgart in Vermont. German/ VW dream. Super awesome show.
Cancel this guy, please!
You're into European econo-boxes in the US, like I'm into US trucks in Europe. Forbidden fruit stuff. You're the reason I watched Donut. Good luck with the project. Cheers.
Jetta’s are nicer to me
I have a 82 rabbit shell sitting in my woods
A gold mk4 with a 1.9 TDi and minimal rust can be had for 1500€ or even lower in central Europe, your kind of cheap scares me xD
Car guys just get it...... I don't think non-car folk understand the sentiment that we feel for our beloved hoopties.
Now get the EG Honda civic back!
Good stick to you’re car bs  and don’t talk about shoes or skating again
As a MK7 owner (by far the most universally regarded as the most reliable Golf GTI ever made) these cars can* become money pits EXCEEDINGLY fast, even with no modifications. yes they are fun but get ready for the timing chain, water pump, fuel pump, oil/coolant consuption and a litany of electrical issues if you decide to chance an old Golf.
@Aeromagic, tu coche al minuto 8:11 😃
Hi James do you still own the old Wheels of your Golf? Iam really intressted on them! Or do you know what Brand and Modell they are? Would love to know it! 😁
something about this is insanely low energy.
Ugh this makes me want my TDI back so bad. 😢 I traded it in for my mom mobile (Tiguan)
Vr6 lyfe
We're all very glad that you're safe from the fires, but you should definitely move to visalia.
dude ngl i watched your first handful of videos when you first started speeed and i kinda fell off for a while but seeing it now is pretty awesome, each video a banger pulling in tha VIEWS man! doing something right! first videos to make me sub to donut way back in the day were some of yours. been a fan and still a fan, good sh*t
Only VW i could ever own or drive is beattle or corrado, rest is huge pile of shieee
Can I join you with my 1987 16v 2.0L Scirocco? It's just a squashed Golf right?
vw is gay nazi car.
It's not a collectable car. It's okay I guess
Buy a new one.. They cost 500 euro in Germany
I gotta do my Jetta project
No way total waste of time throw that pile away vw sucks and you will never change my opinion
it's the best bang for your buck cuz they suck to work on
I miss my Mk. IV Jetta. It was blue and bulletproof and best of all smelled like crayons. I should have never traded it. 2.0 NA be damned I loved that car.
a sketchy coffee shop gives me the vibes of like a bougie Beverly hills crack house sorta thing lol
Never been a VW guy, but you might make me one. Super stoked for this build.
Eurotuner definitely always had the more tasteful cars. I still remember this red orange pearl widebody GTI that was gorgeous. I wanted to recreate that color, but never did 😭
Taking Back Sunday mentioned 🖤🤘🏻
you look healthier bro
Here come the inflated golf prices now
Dear Mr Pumph,   I’m Pumph’d for this build!
Show JP‘S G3 Project and talk about replicated ist pretty hilarious 😂 Shows perfect hoe you only show pictures and have no clue what’s behind the project ✌️
I hit the like button as soon as I heard the engine ticking really bad after it blew up
Thos cars look gay tho. I wanna see a Honda
I’ve been doing the rockers and floors in a mk3  Jetta  I was able to get panels from eBay that fit pretty well and were reasonably priced .Key parts are the sellers.Good luck with the car and the channel.
Is he allowed to say it? You what I’m talking about. When he started discussing the engine rebuild. I felt it was coming…. But no…. Can we not get a moar powr baby! ..??
Shout out to the guy who sold James the golf all those years ago from Craigslist, making sure hes alright with the fires 15 years later
VW Vortex was really the spawn location for modern modified car culture. Remember talking to all you guys way back then 🙏🏻
Dude, I watched many Donut videos just to see your goofy ass. Without you, I've never even wasted a second to watch them.
Seeing that car at L'oe Show the first year was so rad dude. Glad to see it back in your hands, bring it back to the east coast soon!
love that there is audi a2 on the car magazine
Bro cut the floors out and swap it with a Audi TT and make it quattro it's been done and worth every penny I've owned 5 mk3 I swapped 1.8t engines into it back in 2004 did 12s 1/4 all stock 1.8t swapped mk3
Can’t wait
VW are mostly crap, mate...
You know Hondas are getting pricey when a VW is the best project option
0:15 this is not a replica of your golf. This golf has nothing to do with the original golf.
epic car bro, btw i think you should make a video about wörthersee. the whole history about it.  love those kinda videos like the stüssy one and the gt3rs one a lot they are crazy good. anyways look into wörthersee its crazy espacally because u love golfs so much
5:50 KARLSRUHEEEE
0:15 this isnt a replica ist a project by jpperformance to fit an r8 inside an golf 3
In Europe only people who don't care about and know nothing about cars buy a Golf. Because it is just a generic car. "Just get a Golf."... 😂
Nice one! But my favourite one was always a MK4
Taking back sunday mentioned lmao
I have a 2012 GTI 6 speed . Paid off. Not running rn but I’ll never get rid of it!!
Golf 3rd generation - maybe not even that bad by design, but without a doubt the poorest product of the whole family at the time it came out. In terms of poor quality it was eclipsed by the 5th generation Golf which in turn had to cede this questionable throne to the 6th generation... I live in Germany and I do cars for a living - trust me, I know what I'm talking about.  By any means, if you insist on doing a Golf project, look for a 1st, 2nd or 4th generation chassis.
As a bmw owner I'd say this. Old German shitboxes are the best project cars
I have a 2001 golf and I'd love to engine swap it but I think my wife would kill me 🤣😂
Mk2 16V  >>>>>> all vw crap
My dear american friend we have here a sayin in the balcans: Only the even number models are worth apart from the new 8gen model thats no golf anymore.
I got a golf project myself! Mk5 Rabbit 2.5 same exact engine as James, except its stock apart from exhaust. Its arguably one of the more reliable engines VW has ever produced, as well as just down right unique. But I plan on keeping it NA so I don't make the same mistakes 😂 . Thanks for keeping the Golf scene alive!
He has the Twinkle in his eyes again!!! I missed this bro...  After u left Donut i was lost😂😂😂 pop pop pop it up head lights😅 lightning lightning lightning...
What is this weird AI voice over in german? You lost a sub :/
As a german im baffled that you guys buy a mark 3 golf for 7k... i´d pay like 2k for one with below 65k miles.
That is not bad at all in the uk all out cars look like that after 15years so a 25 plus year old car that is in excellent repairable condition we spend over 500hrs fixing rust on our cars
Me thinking I need to buy a Golf project can, only to walk outside a few minutes after and see our totally neglected Golf 3.5 Convertible!
I’ve subscribed because of this project and you being on spikes! You might inspire me to rebuild my 40 year old mk2 scirocco
Remove one of the individual headlights and put the air intake go from there. 😊
0:15 did @JPPerformance replicate it? Idk man look at the body work that thing got completely reworked and is not a replica stop it! Inspired at best but replica? Come on man😅 Look at how high up the wheel space is. Its not a replica its his own work man stop that misinfo of it beeing a replica. Cause im sry but this was reworked by designers and whatnot its not even a mk3 anymore just the basis, you cannot get a mk3 this low you just cant😅
Who's this bald red guy?
I have an atlas cross sport which can be argued to just be an insanely massive golf 😅
I support doing Speed!!!
got a dented up 2014 jetta for $4k
Love this! I'm in Aus I have a mk4 Polo (not sure if US got??) stage 2 tuned 1.9TDI and it's a banger! Can I join haha
1.900.000 views on 1.360.000 subs in 48 hours.....Shows what being Genuine, Funny, simple and relatable; gets you. WE LOVE YOU AND THE CONTENT. KEEP GOING💙
I FRICKIN LOVE SPEEEEED!!! AND I LOVE YOU JAMES! Let’s get that VW ROLLIN’ BAYBEEE
James: "Let me tell you a story..." Me: "You have my undivided attention for aslong as you need."   Love when your passionate about something, you can feel it on you through the video. Hell makes me want to cash out my savings and go get a Jetta.
And it looks awful
What was your VWvortex name?
Knowing you're in cali, uhhh, do the shops "help" with the smog or like wtf and how the hell you gonna get a 500hp golf past smog?  Obviously not trying to narc on you or something, but just trying to understand how the hey y'all get away with your shenanigans without owning property in a smog on transfer zip code and just registering everything to that.
My daily is an 02 gl. It’s got the 2.slow but it’s a stick shift. It’s not a project, but it’s so much more fun to drive than modern cars. I’ve also owned a mk 6, and probably will try to find another 5 cyl some day
My brother was one of the biggest in the racing scene in New York. His name was Enzo. He swore by his mk3-6, all swapped with the diesel or vr6 all bored, sleeved and tuned. Big turbo, he made his living off the $ he won off street racing.
wow, so pumped for tis as a series! gearing up to build a 2k caddy right now, getting back in VW like my younger years. The mention of all the old mags and forums, pure nostalgia!
Golfs are expensive to repair with OEM parts being massively overpriced, the early one's rust like bean cans at the beach, there are loads of better options in Europe, Americans are starved of hot-hatches so it makes sense for you to rebuild this car,
Ain’t no arguing with what James has said. 90’a vw’s are truly the best
See, I liked you back in the day, but now you're up like 50 points because VW is my life.
tell me more bout that dakar yellow e30 in the shop...
He’s back!
golf owners unite! lets goooo, happy to see this one is going to survive
Has always been a huge VW fan. I gave up working on them. Special tools and triple square everything had been a pain. MK4 R32 is still a dream car.
Thank you for making this video, summed up why VW community was so big back in the day and why people loved VWs. Being born in the late 90s i caught the last whiff of the good ole VW days. I was such a die hard, I took my MK4 “GLI32” from Canada to Worthersee in 2019 also with Jaime’s help, that was a life changing experience. And then Covid happened, and VW changed directions to EV, and lost a lot of the community after that. VW community these days died down a lot all around the world, East coast and die hard VW countries still have a decently strong community but not a whole lot of new comers, look at how few MK8s are at VW shows. Most of MK7 generation owners are quite different from pre Mk7 VW guys, since a lot of them are after the speed and horsepower per dollar instead of perfect stance, rare parts, and cars and coffee. People just don’t understand spending hundreds on some rare euro navi, thousands on old plastic body kits (projektzwo) and wheel lips and barrels to get the perfect fitment, days and weeks shaving the bay and polishing parts. Old school VW guys were so much about just building what was perfect in their mind and sharing to the community instead of my stage 8 ecu stage 7 tcu golf is 0.02s quicker than your golf.
Don't forget Fast and Furious
That's not car, that WAS car...
i have 2 mk4, on tdi wagon and one gti with 1.8turbo love them
Unfortunately I have to say that MK4 is a better car it looks better and  doesn’t rust that bad.
Hey James, I live in the Phillipines I was lucky to find the rare one of that mark 3 as four door hatch vr6 which is I never knew it was existed as rare vr6 golf mark 3 in my country found one the other places here in my city which sat the some kind of vw repair shop garage with a some kind of a food shop so called the "Garaje Grill & Café" along with it with other vw cars like the two door mark 4 (not yet know if the 2 door mark 4 was vr6 as well) the the other red one was gone after months back on 2024 but both remain the 2 door mark 4 in satellite grey and black mark golf vr6 was still on the parking garage of the unknown vw repair shop with other more vw cars like the mark 2 gold and jetta which I also believe previously have an vr6 engine too which is empty on the google map that was not updated yet for some photos to see but I'll link here the google map of it not click bait 100% legit =>  the food shop where it is located: https://maps.app.goo.gl/gHnfTemPo3Lmpe1h9 The Street view of it: https://maps.app.goo.gl/ehCcsCpG9aKWwMPDA
James looking slim these days. 🙏
I'm on the look out for a mk4 GTI. Best looking golf GTI ever made.
I love you
James, why can't you accept that you should do car stories. That's your calling my dude. Not cargo clothes smh
I've own almost all MkIV versions of the golf. My first was a base 2002 golf. I then got a 2001 Cabrio, still have it. Then I got a 2001 GTI. Only thing I'm missing is the original R32. My mission is to get it by end of year. I want the full deck
Pacific golf ?? Never heed of that model😅
That rust isnt even that bad lol. seen WAAAAAY  worse
Just does nothing for me. I’ll stick to American classic cars and trucks.
My first build was a 12v mkiv vr6 with a gt35r. I miss it and have been eyeing another build lately. Glad to see these might make a comeback!!
bin it and get a a evo 8. or build a awd eg honda hatchback.
Come to RSA Bruu
Golfs are alright, but the old school Hondas are everything you think golfs were to the car community.
Golfs are alright, but the old school Hondas are everything you think golfs were to the car community
I hate golfs because of the ricer boys from my high school with indigestion tunes and Wall Street egos 🎉🎉. Miata is always the answer !!!
Commuinity! 😂
What's going on with the black yata? That was the best series
I love medium build!!!!! sick hat.
Missed you brother ❤
For added VW immersion I'm watching this video with the German auto dubbing turned on
Who's this bald red guy?
I just sold my mk4 golf gti hours before this comment and I miss it already
My first car was an mk3 Jetta 2.0. It only ran for two months before the ignition switch went out and it had a few electrical problems. I couldn't afford to fix it so it sat for 10 years, the last three were spent trying to get it to run. I have an mk6 1.8t Jetta now, but I really miss my mk3.
That ozempic doing work on my guy
3:48 "bald, red guy" LMAO
I neeeed to know if i can get that i-5 in a rwd application!!!
I have an ‘89 Jetta coupe VR6 swap, and ‘90 Corrado G60. These old Volkswagens have so much character and style!! If you’re going to go 500 HP, you should look at doing an AWD swap as well James!
i saw a vid that 944s where secretly great cars... and the price went up like 10% for 3 months until everyone forgot
James, I love this! I'm a die-hard Ford fanboy. Muscle cars, hot rods, customs and, trucks are my thing normally. But I really dig not only this car, but your passion for it! That's something I can seriously both respect and enjoy! Look forward to seeing what you do with it man. Keep up the great work!
This video might be relevant in America, however outside of America they are the plague. Every 2nd kid has a golf, and if they don't it's because they wanted rear wheel drive.  Don't mention the awd golf R they are hot garbage in handling dept. Golf are overrated and universally disliked in Australia... in Europe it's just another golf ( an car )
I'm excited to see this journey!!!!
James, please contact IE so we can get some dope 07k parts and content!
Just started my own Mk6 Golf R project. Cant wait to see how this turns out!
My car? Wait a sec
The Corrado was such a great looking car.
3:45. BRING BACK LOW WAIST JEANS FOR HOT CHICKS!!!!!!
Where and when can we hang out and work on our golfs lol
we buy it and then we K-swap it, right?
God damn you are looking great!
VW is junk
fell in love with this build when i first saw it being built on DAP Autopart’s video and the reveal on donut underground. so sick to see it again even if it’s in kind of a rough state. hope to see more vids (don’t hope mk3 prices go up because im currently hunting for one)
Damn, nice Medium Build hat mate. Amazing singer he is.
Dose a stage 2 jetta tdi alh  off-road build count?
Honestly I'm saving up to get a brand new golf, ive fallen in love with the car
Cool story dude! yeah Vw"s are all over the world and everyone loves them.
The car scene died when car forums and streetfire died.
You either get the styling or you don't. I fall in to the "don't category".
😢❤
Seems cool never in my life would I buy a VW but still cool makes me want to get into something... Just not VW's never VW's
I lived on the VWvortex forums back in the day, despite having nothing but issues with every VAG car I've ever owned.... And yet I still consider them whenever I'm in the market for a new car because I absolutely love (and hate) them.
love the book club idea. i read dark matter a few years ago, ITS A DOOZY
All of the stuff he credited to America was only done to copy japan lmfao lowering cars, cleaning engine bays, camber, wide tires, wide body kits, all japan lmfao all America does is produce 20L v8’s that make 200hp
Oh hell yeah! Excited for you.  Going to be a great series!!
Saab v dub some of the best cars going
Man that grill would look great on my 98 GTI
Oh yes, OH YES
If you wanna see VWs, go to Brazil. The entire car culture is build on top of Volkswagen, since the 90's.
My first car was a 04 “golf with a butt”
rip H2oi. these kids nowadays will never understand how legendary the event was.
Wtf happened to donut? Fell apart fast. Yall remember Bart 6 years ago. Yeah he was awesome. He would have done amazing work for donut if he stayed. As the years went on i lost interest in donut for they got more and more lame.
nah bro sell tha shi*&box as much as i love it its to rusty and dangerous for you to drive it like that which puts you and other in danger
The VW Golf/GTi is effectively the Ford Mustang of Europe.  It has the same level of aftermarket support as Mustangs and Jeeps.  Sure a Honda Civic has a lot of aftermarket support too, but a lot of the parts you find for Civics are "universal fitment".  With the VW Golf/GTi, Ford Mustang and Jeep (you know which one) the majority of the aftermarket parts are specific parts with specific fitments for specific model years.  There is very little "universal fitment".
the dude who sold you that car at sema is probably stressin with the poor thing looking the way it does right now
Those things are pure trash
Got mine 3 months ago for 1k 180,xxx on it still in clean condition
Lmao I saw my car in there! But fuck bro I miss waterfest and h2o. Fun fact, the chilis meet at waterfest where people went bananas and ended up blocking the cops from getting into the parking lot is used in police training videos. Footage compliments of los goonies.
“They’re as old as this car was when I was young” the facial expression and video effect combo 😂😂😂
bn
No Corrado love.. 😢
The vw golf is a depreciating asset that will never be worth anything, like most cars, its sad to say but the community around these is dying for a reason. Nobody wants these cars anymore.
They just look so disgusting.  I love the paint on yours, but the body is SO UGLY.  Takes the worst thing about an car that ruins the looks (hatch) and doubles down, haha, they're ONLY hatches.
I currently own and daily drive a $400 200k miles mk4 Jetta 2.0 I paid $400 bucks for 8 yrs ago  with northeast FENDER  rot not TOTAL sill rot like yours (jk) and am anxiously waiting for it to be classed as antique in my state. I have a stretched fender .. bbs wearing turbo 1.8t  in my head and oh ya I’m a mechanic so I won’t be paying for ANY LABOR… just the parts FROM A JUNKYARD.. soooo needless to say I’m with you VW are sooo cool
Honestly sounds like you need a Honda.
Hey I got to drive that car in Forza Horizon 5 thanks James that was a lot of fun hope to see you guys again in Forza
Put a vr6 in like it deserves
Happy I found your channel missed watching you <3
Ive seen some cool VW builds. Known a bunch of guys with cool VW's. The thing they all have in common is they all broke. Alot. Lol.
I'm glad to see the golf make a comeback, but I really wanna know what happened to your 86 down the road.   Keep us posted, love the videos!
Youtube needs to add a "love" feature like Netflix has, Zero interest in VWs but 100% interest J-Pump.
damn james youre lookin SLIM!
If it weren't for James I'd never would've known about Donut Media.   His snappy catchy appropriate & funny catchphrases for vehiclesi keep saying around vehicles, whether at a carshow, cars & coffee,  car meets & or working on mine, even if it's the chainsaw, lawnmower, weed trimmer, power/air tools.  Mo' powa baby, Ram chargers, Bwaaaaaaaaahhhhhh, LIGHTING! LIGHTING! LIGHTING! Buff horses, herspers.  It's not the same, won't be the same when someone from Donut say them. They've lost their effect & pinache.
From Donuts to Ozeeempic?
Ah I forgot my engine is fully forged top and bottom end everything that could be forged has been forded even the cams are schrick cams from Germany which are pre order every six months only! 😮
my first car was a mk3 golf, i recall vwvortex, man, good freaking times
Was the V & W connected or did it have a space/seperated at V & W?
I like the Sciroco better not sure if I spelled that right
4 wheels, that's a good car. Add round steering, 1 or 2 transparent windowing and you've got a first-rate "vehicle" as we say in the biz
My first car is he mk3 TDI 1997 blew the engine 3 times  Then got a golf 5 GTI blew the engine again 2/3 times then rebuilt it you must some see it ;)
I'm Volkswagen for life.. The first car I bought was an 89 8v 1.8 auto Jetta, I still have it 15yrs later, I recently purchased an 07 Rabbit 2.5 Auto and absolutely love it..  My Jetta needs some work and thinking of doing a 2.5 and manual swap..
Bosnia heavy breathing
Soo i currently sell vw golf rs gti ect . But the funny thing is in the first 50 seconds of watching this video you already convinced me to find a project golf r or gti to build im now going to marketplace and kijiji il watch the rest of your video later g lol
Ok, you convinced me that a Grolf[SIC] is a great bang for my buck (BOTH of them...) project car. So much so, that I went ahead and got a head start and got one (several) before this vid existed. Nifty. FULLY AGREE that VW guys (not "scene" shitheads, if there even is much of a scene anymore...) are the ones that brought the creativity and unique-ish mods that are every frikkin where now. The creativity is what made me wander off from the Honda camp and go full frontal VW. I will not mention the K swapped Corrado fight starter "resting" in the garage presently, disguised as a large glob of parts. A friendly fellow described it as "a waste of a car". I really feel sorry for some people; they probably struggle to figure out which end of a spoon is the "good" end...
Girls don’t like Volkswagens they like grabber blue mustangs
I have a 2.5 5cyl, 5spd in my 2012 dog dish beetle and I absolutely love it! such a characterful engine
Stoked to see your sub count, dawg.
Corvette sawtooth wheels on an MK4 R32 is ugly in a coool way.  *I looked this up, and you're right. What began as a V-dub thing, is now in every scene. You can see corvette wheels on everything from S2000s to Subaru Legacys, and even E30s
Boa noite amigo, começa a pesquisar como foi e é a cena Vokswagen no Brasil, prometo que não vai se arrepender, procure "BGT águas de lindoia" Abraço e parabens pelo conteudo!
golfs are so cool
Just motivated me to work on my mk4, i was thinking about selling but its my first car and although it needs some work i think itll be worth it at the end of the
Love my 04 R32. Let’s cruse!
On the thing I'll never buy again ..  A golf is on the top off the list . Worst car I've ever owned.
Goated upgrade is Cabrio rockers. They’re extra thick for drop top reasons. A pain in the rear to cut out but you’ll never have to replace them again.
90’s Golf will never die.
You got a nice house for such a depraved Volkswagen fanatic
Definitely the ugliest car I’ve ever seen    Why would you go blue rims 😂😂😂  Americans are so crass
Tell me "This is everything you need to know to get up to speed on my passion with Volkswagen Golf!" Without telling me... 😂❤ miss this series! Bring it back!
My first race car was an 87 scirocco.
yes, simply yes! BUT! dont ever not talk about mark 2s in that conversation!!!111!11!!1
Grew up riding around with a few friends of my parents owning the rabbits. Big fan of the 70s and 80s of those cars had the experience of riding in with one with gas and diesel comfy cars to ride in. The vow rabbit  The convertible ones were for girls that drove them ha ha that’s what everybody used to say.
In germany we call „might as well“ „wenn man schonmal dabei ist“. Which I think is important to know, rebuilding a German car.
Grown up with being around very rabbit. Those are the ones I love.
Did you loose weight?
let's go !
Love my golf got a stage 2.5 mk7.5 best decision I ever made
I’ve been looking at getting my first car, and this is very helpful and a good selling point for me. Thanks James!!!
Refreshing to see an obtainable build, with semi-normal issues for a project, put on by one of the best in the YouTube space! ✨🙌
Wait did i miss something did he leave donut?
Lol you an cleet both crankcase boostin 🤣
Nah dude the B5 Audi is the best project car
Volkswagen is underrated. My (side) project car is a 2000 Beetle, 2.0L, 256k miles and 25 years of use and abuse and that engine will not stop. I sold it in 2023 and it sat for over a year in a forest, slowly rotting, before the new owner gave up and gave it back - I had it running again in 3 days. The worst part was the upholstery was [moist] and needed heavy cleaning but that car won't quit. Oh and a squirrel or something got under the hood so I did some new sensors and wiring >.<
As someone who's eyes was recently opened to the Golf GTI when I got a MK7.5, yes. I have always loved old muscle cars and hatch backs, and getting into the VW Golf community has been amazing. I have never driven a car that I could just relax and cruise in while simultaneously destroy 100mph with ease. It feels so well constructed and safe while also being fun as frick. I honestly have a lot of respect for people that have older MKs in great condition, especially with some minor issues that have come out of the Golf line in the last few generations. But honestly they really are timeless cars... minus the mk8.
My first car purchase was a mk3 Jetta.
Lol hear me out... B5 longitudinal floorpan swapped R32...  R32 engine, r32 body, longitudinal Audi Quattro instead of 4motion
Ahhh, James getting in on that Brian Scotto market manipulation game lol
13 Jetta tdi 🤙🏼
Can me and my e-gulf come hangout?
What does he he mean by “back from Donut”?
Yeah I definitely noticed most big car YouTubers came from the VeeDub scene
Awe, this is awesome!
Nooo. Dont. Stop. I dont wanna like vdubs. Ugh ok fine.
my mom owns a cabrio, so maybe i'm biased but the golf is pretty cool NGL!
MaxPower Magazine!!!! Eurotuner!!!!!
I think the bang for your buck part no longer applies now.
you like VWs? you should tune a 1994 Gol. yeah, brazilian Gol, look for it! it's an amazing tuner and I know people would love to see a good work in one of those, this car made VW the most sold cars in Brazil for over 20 years. just think about this, please!
Mk3 gang.
Yeah a Porsche boxer engine, nice go for it!!
Speeeeed, has been able to give me back those childhood vibes. Something I've been wanting for a while.
Any one else spotted that clean nissan hardbody on minute 11:32
If the jetta goes up ill be happy I got a 1.8l manual 2002 😂
bang for buck even over a beetle?
Please mk3 me James. Please. Let's go.
At the end of it all it's still a VW.
My mr2 won't let me look at other cars.
Hands down. Mk7.5 big turbo owner. 😊
Woah, long time no see. You're looking fresh.
I miss when u were fat tbh
“ Why I think they’re so undervalued “  Okay AND ??? Why are people going out of their way to intentionally raise the price of certain cars? This is single-handedly ruined in the car market. If something is affordable, let it be affordable. Holy shit.
Ahhh man, seeing this video makes me not want to sell my GTI. Been a love/hate relationship for the last year. VR6 sounds are so worth it tho
MK3 Golf and Jetta GLX ! My favorite!
So stoked for VW content!
Build that shit james
Didn’t this dude used to be fat and funny?  Guess Iv been gone awhile
As a South African  I appreciate this
Over here it's a girl car, same with the honda fitz and the Toyota Jet
'Commuinity' ? Lol. Mk3's look sick, but they are shitboxes when it comes to rust. Once it starts there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to stop it. I've had a project golf when I was at uni, got all the rust repaired, Mk4 R32 blue paint, deep dish wheels. It looked sick. I sunk probably a year's worth of wages into a piece of shit. Never again will I own a project car before 2010 when all rust issues were sorted by the auto industry. I mean Mk3's and E36's (same era, same ruat issues) are the worat option if you don't live in the desert. DON'T DO IT. DON'T DO IT.
Brings back good memories of my parent's Mk.2 that ran on vegetable oil back in '06 - Left the neighbourhood smelling like french fries when we drove through.
I hate the fact that donut took that one guys s14. It’s so nice and meticulously built and now it just sits on a damn lift and rots in the Cali sun
you make me miss my vr6. edit just come back and add.  your feelings about japanese and american cars, exact same feeling.  they're awesome cars, but something about vw's.  i had a mk3 jetta glx dumped on nuespeed springs rolling on momo arrows.  god i loved that car.
If if you can find a decent clean one VR6 Corrado is a good investment and will only go up over time
Always had Golf Gtis. Current project car: VW Golf Mk1 Karmann Clipper ‘93
didnt realize you left donut too. i have an 07 eos, the ladies golf. $1500 and 60k miles later, shes still kickin ass
This mk3 is one of my favorite mk3 colors lol
I'm with ya lol got my  mk1 mountain green rabbit in progress to be obd1 aba  Mk2 90 jetta in progress to be full aba swap Mk3 gti white gti soon to be full euro spec lol slammed on shmits  Mk3.5 cabrio  Mk4 tropic and Futura lol Also had a handful of others, lmao, and only 23, lmao  One of my old one's a 98 gti got rolled and cartwheeldled and I walked away no problem literally went to work the next day lmao It sold me on these mk3's lmao (wreck was dew to shit tires long storyshort)
My first car was a 1998 VR6. Fell in love with the scene and went all in on a big turbo  build for my 04 gli.  So much money spent. No regrets!
looks like u lost weight hopefully it was in a healthy way good job dude
I'll buy a Toyota instead
The Car Lounge on VWVortex was the place to be!
Everyones cousin has one of those cars around here and they are not that much overrated in eurasia
I can assure you that JP Perfomance did not "replicate" your car xD
Nope. I want a 2nd gen viper. First step, put on a ridiculously large spoiler.
Honestly I wish the old-school car scene would return instead of the street takeovers like now. It was fun out in front pepboys. You had the loud mouth racers who thought they were fast the humble ones who actually were fast the stereo group domestics, euros, and jap cars and trucks everywhere. No fights, no civil unrest, no burnouts, no revs, everyone regardless of make and model would do a cruise at the end. It was social networking before the social media craze
So, what you're saying is I should go and buy a New Beetle? Got it! Thanks James! 🥰
honestly fuck donut.keep doing you brother <3
Mo Powa Babeh!
You deserve it, enjoy
I want to do it but with my Polo 6n1, do you agree ?
love a golf
I'm not even into cars, I mean I like them, but I'm not into them like 'car guys' are... That said, I'm into this project.  I love seeing people follow their passion and build cool sh*t.  I'm subbed and can't wait to follow the journey.  Cheers!
I don't think I've ever clicked and bought a tee so fast.
“That’s a nice golf” - Some old meme
i dont like golfs but they are most popular in balkans
My biggest regret is selling my 20th anniversary GTI. I bought it in 2005 and I sold it in 2009. I think about that car every day.
Got a 99 VW golf gti. She’s my toxic relationship
I thought you was on the other one but once I find out that you left unfollowed and came over here
Now we got Ľoe show instead of h2o and in my opinion even better than h2o
I just comment because I want more people to see this video😅
What’s a Voltswagen?
Minitrucks started it all, not VW’s
LFFFFGGGGGGGGGGGGG I love my VWs; I got three myself :)
I have a mk1 cabriolet with a regular 4 cylinder with 8 valves
glad you got that car back! I have so much love for the mk3 golf got one at 19 in 2015 and it was a 1997 golf cl with the 90hp 1,8 engine in "saturn yellow" (apparently very rare color for a mk3 golf to be in) former owner had put some body parts from the vr6 model on it and it looked so damn good had it for 4 years and for a 900 euro "beater"? it was damn glorious and reliable i only got rid of it because rust ended up eating the poor thing's chassis alive (thanks finnish salted roads in winter lol)
With all due respect - jp didn’t replicate your golf❤️
What about a Jetta vr6?
Wish List and Fix List-perfect way to plan a project!
Mk3 golf was my first car. It was an utter shit box, but I loved it, full of rust, hated having an exhaust attached, but with a 1.8 petrol it flew, I’ve had a mk5 and now drive a mk6. Brilliant cars that just do car things
I love vws but as someone who lives in PA the PA Dubber scene has made it increasing harder to find a clean vw for a reasonable price
He’ll mog me soon
no one talks about the mk3 vr6
James and Scotto gotta be together for a whole episode
Very cool project! Can't wait to see the progress!
"golf is the best car to build on" _blows up the engine after a basic pull_ I'll stick to a bulletproof VQ lol
Love it! I have a MK3 VR6 myself, which has been sitting in my garage without seeing daylight since 2010. The plan was to turbocharge it after running a Vortech supercharger for a couple of years, but it hasn’t happened just yet. One day, though, it will be back on the road!  I do regret selling the supercharger kit, though, the sound was absolutely incredible.
I had one of these years ago, worst car I ever owned hands down and it wasn't even the car itself that caused all the problems, well besides the unreliability, the stupid suspension setup and the AWFUL gearbox and overcomplex engineering.   Its the people and community around them. Some of the most toxic people ever and will shoot you down for suggesting something bold and interesting. I scrapped it and bought a first generation WRX and it was the best thing I ever did.  If you want a good front wheel drive project car that ticks every box, don't buy a german shitbox. Get a Honda EP3 Type R and never look back.
Had a 96 Trek edition MK3 jetta back in 08-14.  I loved that car, even with its little 2L. Definitely feeling nostalgic with this build
0:15 Tahts not a replica, that golf has a audi r8 v10 in the back and the Front is a complete costume design. @JPperformance
My Mk2 Gti goes in next month for its 3.2 vr6 swap. Really hoping to be done in time for the Roots Classic later this year.
I AM READY to work on my mk7 w u🫡
i like these videos
Moooooorrreeee Powwwwwaaa Babbyyy!!!!!
DAMN! Man, James, nailed the love for the GTI i have. Save all the GTIs!!! Vr6 for life!
hey man just found your channel again so glad your back you were the soul of donut not gonna lie man just went to a funeral and not gonna lie watching your video really cheering me up i appreciate you
I owned several Golf 3 back in the day, incl Variant (Wagon) and diesel. If I should have one as a hobby/projectcar today, it would be the VR6. All my Golfs rusted to death!
Yo, James. I love your merch. I neeeeeed it, but theres a problem. I have a tall/fat head. I wish I could rock a dad-hat (which is sold out anyway), but they never reach all of the way down to my ears. They just start slowly rising, and they fall off my melon. Is there any chance you guys might come out eith a nice 59FIFTY style/snapback? I would love that. Embroidered of course. Thanks for all that you do. I was really getting tired of Donut straying from the content I love, and here it lives on with you. So glad your car will live on. Peace.
Sickkkkkkkkkk
Guess I’ll build my 04 r32 then
I own a Mk6 GTI, and it’s so far been nothing but issues, I haven’t driven it for almost 2 years now and I so badly miss driving it.
I love my mk7
Trying to get started on my Mk2 and cannot for the life of me find a windshield that isn't over $600 because of shipping
Am I the only person that never liked this guy?
I had a 3 gen us import in finland with a 2.0l motor it had some nice options that you could't find in finnish vw golfs
I've had 2 golf 3 daily beaters, and a VR6 passat which was the best car I've ever had , love VW's <3
James is awesome actually got hooked on Snapchat 😂
The amount of views this guy gets on a brand new channel, all by himself, is astounding to be honest. He deserves it though, and I’m glad this whole transition away from Donut has worked out well.
7:45 NA 2.5 and 2.5 tfsi are completely different engines btw
Idk man, i picked up a running 99 sc400 for 400$ and im stoked
Anyone have a mk3 golf hatch plate holder?
5:04 don’t worry James we got a club full of vws from the mk1 rabbit to the m8 R
Got to ask, what are your thoughts on the 1996 Saturn sc1 coupe? I ask because that was my first car.
I still have my mk4 golf and best first manual car to start ❤
Dude, I'm from Belgium. You know, the prefered warzone of Europe. As a teenager i washed cars to earn some money. Inside and outside. I would even pull the seats out to give cleans. You can not imagine how many Mk3's i's done. it was sometimes 6 or 7 in just 1 weekend.
8:44 got to say I like the list and tape setup. Keep it up and keep making the dreaming and chasing.
After seeing this I'm about to restore my Golf 4 to a monster.
smaller wheels bigger tires
Been loving the output of this channel, James leaving donut was the way. Can't wait to see what happens with this Golf!
Hondas are best bang for buck project cars. VW’s are money pits designed to fail …like all German cars not named Porsche or Merc (80s and earlier). I get the appeal, I truly want to love German cars, they are great in many ways, but they’re just unreliable and expensive and design/engineering choices with an extreme “planned obsolescence” business model and proprietary parts control designed to line the pockets of manufacturers…I can’t reward this shortsighted and selfish approach with my money. And nothing anyone does is as capable, reliable, and value retaining as anything Japanese offer in basically every category across the board.
I’ve always said that the golf is the perfect car. It’s literally exactly a car. No more or no less. Does car need trunk? No. Car has wheels and doors and hood. The end.
Got into VW when the MK3 was newer. Never liked them at all. Waited for the MK4 Jetta to buy my first usedJetta. It was a 99 1/2 MK4. My first new car was a 05 Jetta MK4 TDI. Moved on to BMW then Acura.
My Mk5 Golf GTI has the exact same problems. It has pretty bad blow-by and a decent amount of rust in the same spot. I wish you the best of luck.
I've been driving 20 years but never give VW a look until 5 years ago I bought a VW CC, needed a dad car haha, I've fell in love with it and VW it's honestly been the most reliable car I've owned, I'm on looking now for my next car and it's going to be a VW Golf R estate (wagon in the US), I'm just waiting for the right one to pop up at the right price
This video hit on so many levels. I still have a mk1 project buried in my garage. I remember the heyday of the scene and still have a bunch of friends that I met through the VW community. I also met the most important person in my life through the VW community, my wife. Your car is exactly my style, and my mk3 Golf was very similar with all that 90s goodness. Same cup mirrors, Hella dual rounds, Kamei badgeless grill, dual DTM exhaust, and Porsche phone dials. Such a timeless design and a great era for VW build quality. Except for the epic rust issues that plague the mk3.
Keep the content coming big dog !
Hell Yea brotha!! Glad to see the golf come back !
Junk those wheels. Rust ain’t bad
still though, must be nice to live in a place where the roads are somewhat decent, no 6 months of winter every year like where i live.. that will shorten the lifespan of a lot of cars. Still though, that rust.. i feel you there.
Jokes on you James I already have project Vw’s
Can I be your car friend?
Not documented ? And I'm guessing you are in the states .so your car is an illegal alien 😂. ❤
I gotta say i was interested in this video but saying that JP Performances G3 (a Golf 3 body on an Audi R8) is a copy of yours is wrong. The only thing they both have is problems. Thats it.
sold!
As a long time 'texer, I'm pumped to see the love given to the forums.  That's where I got my start with VW's and went into 5cyl turbo Audis.  I love that this car has a turbo 5 cyl swap, and it looks so clean too.  I can't wait to see the next update on it.  I hit the subscribe button, because you're speaking my language as an elder Millenial.
Wish I remembered going to h2oi
Hi James, my mom had a ''raspberry red'' 2 door golf mk3 back when I was a child. I have so many great memories with that car, but rust was an issue. Glad to see that you'll provide us golf content!
This brings back all the car lounge/vortex feels.  And huge names like mr ginster, demon 8v, wolfman jason  Cant wait for the progression
Might start with a better "project car"   Body or motor.
You should do like a top 20 accessory’s you should get for your outfits
Calling JP´s creation a replica of this is very daring. :)
yo how did the writing stay on the whiteboard when he pulled the tape off
More Castro = more views!  I like that dude. Good genuine energy
Bald red guy?     Clarify this statement.
The VW MK6-present community sucks. A bunch of haters that all want the same look and wheels
h20i was a vw meet ?
Golf 3 was my second car. Worst I've ever had. Cube it.
how much power / boost pressure was it running when it blew up??
Is this channel just James?
didn’t know he grew up in KY lol. that’s what’s up, me too
Video starts @17:39
My first car was a British designed car d from an American car company with a Japanese badge. A Mazda 626, basically a Ford escort. It had escort badges on the engine.
the peugeot 206 is the french cousin of the mk3 golf. cool engine options, looks sick, dirt cheap ($8500 or more for the RC variant making 180 horses with a NA 2.0 engine) and unique stuff, well, every french car is weird, and so is the 206, in a unique way.
Had a mk4 gti, was a fantastic car. But i really prefer my b8 A4.
looking forward to the rebuilding of this car
i have Scirocco GTS 2013 No.3300/5000, let me know if u want pics
Croatian car scene is full of vw's but they are 90% toxic people that shit talks any other brand that isn't vw or they are the most high migthy shit heads ass well. In Croatia you will rearly see chill and nice guy with vw
Stop raising prices!!! Lolol jk my golf is great, cant wait to post a few more vids to show people the same love you have!!  My VRT will always be better than your 5cyl
I like to see small car or truck builds on the channel and then do a give away.
The Golfs have always had nice body styles. If I were to get a Golf it I would finance it buy a new one
Bought a Mk4 20th Anniversary GTI new, added Stage 2, Neuspeed suspension and Koni coil overs. Eventually totaled but it was the shizzle, still miss that car every day.
Yeah, my first car was golf 3, then years later gone for golf4 and now I drive golf 5
Glad you got it back
Great video and story telling. Freakin stoked
COMMUINITY LOL
thx
You still stole my money when you were at Donut Media. It’s on-sight with you
The Plural of Lotus Exige is...well...a fun thing to say. EX ZI GEUSE
A MK3 is less then 3000€ here in luxemburg or germany, get a ship and i send you em😂
Long no time no see, you lost a lot bro🤟💪💪💪 nice video keep it up, my wife wanted something with more spcae, so i bought a 1T touran😂, but the interioir is similar😅😂
I think this is my #1 favorite channel now
As A Kid From Chicago, Currently Living in Kentucky. It was a Blast Watching you Describe what life was like in the early 2000's with my 96 MK3 Jetta. 20 Years Later, They Still Talk about That Car. Ive been Itching To replace it for a long time, Inspire me Brother , LETS GOOOO!!!!!
Mo power baby!
Reason #5!!!  Go
Idk, v8 s10s seem cheaper and more fun 🤭
In the Gen 6, avoid the diesel. I currently drive a 2011 jetta tdi/dsg and it's garbage. Because of the front subframe shifting defect and solid axle rear suspension with no sway bar, the handling is poor and unstable. Under hard braking the tail goes light, making the car prone to the tail stepping out.
Now I can watch donut without this annoying hotdog talking as much as he possibly can.
I live in Germany. I have bought last year a VW Golf MK3 Convertible from 1997 and I am having it right now completely restored in Poland. Bought it from an old lady who was driving it since the beginning. She loved it and took good care. Everybody was asking me why I bought this car and nothing special. For me this Golf is and always will be special. :)
If ur from balkan people love golf and everty 3th car on road is golf thats why i hate it
2:07 That's my buddy Jon's car, Goldie!  He still owns it.
Keep the content coming!!!
I would argue the rabbit truck is a golf with a bigger butt
And here i am thinking about selling my mk3 gti, James comes around with this cool video and reignited my desire to finish the car.
Bro every time James says the words “lemme tell ya a story” you know it’s about to be good and he’s finna drop a knowledge bomb
Actually the Golf... My golf 4 has been the car I've spend the most amount of money in repairs and repairs because of it trying to destroy itself again and again 😅
I used to own a sharaco. And  R32 love both of them I want to Buy another one. Great show
I’m a believer that if you want to rebuild it, that makes it worth rebuilding.
bang for your buck... not that i wouldnt sell a kidney for a VR5 mk3 or a spin in a polo g40... but nah, if it wasnt for the engines i wouldnt bother with the 90's veedubs, you can make power but you can't turn. it took vw 2 more gens to get it done right, but by that time it got fat, ugly and the electronic side is a pain, the seats are made off concrete.. and the dsg cancer started.  living in europe and hearing that braaaaap*crunk*braaaap*crunk*braaaaaaaaaap made me understand fartcan memes.   now you turbo VR6 a Skoda roomster, or a fabia... 🤔since vw bought them, Skoda makes the best looking vw products. internals are the same. on top of that, Skoda was was vw's racing WRC brand in the golden age, right as Loeb became unbeatable. that white and green livery was just as cool as the blue and gold subies and the castrol 'yotas..  Not as gaudy and soulless as the Audis, not as meek and bland as the Vw's... and not beaten to shit like the Seat's. typically not driven by morons either.   not that i truely dislike seats.. but the newer cupras with the bronze details look like riced up RS's..
Please for all things that are good on this earth, lose the square fog lights in the grill. Those are wrong for any period. They are probably the cause of some species of whales going extinct they are so awful. Congrats on the save. Miss my Mk 1.
And girls liked them... you bet your ass that matters 😂😂
Workin on building my mk8 GTI, and I’m also starting on rebuilding my mk5 Jetta tdi. I miss that car so bad
alright, i’ll go buy a golf
Why you talking shit on Andrew Tate indirectly at 3:50?   Are you more of a man than him? If so please prove it
i had a vw cabrio vr6 turbo conversion project zwo kit everything duel remis exhaust i was blowing m3s good times
Golf 1, Classic  Golf 2, childhood  Golf 3, Young adulthood  Golf 4, adulthood (actually my first car)  Golf 5, nah Golf 6, nah  Golf 7, perfection  Golf 8, nah
Just as I sell my 72k mile mk5😭😭
I still want a mk4 TDI Bora. Just cuz it's AWD. Lil AWD econobox that can go forever on one tank of gas would be great
I just wanna throw my hat in the ring with all the people you named, because I was also active on vortex in the early 2000s. So there. I also never got drunk at a car show and did anything bad. Never really got into the fancy new MK3s though.  You talk community and it used to be really good. Not sure about these days, but 20 (or more) years later I still have my VW friends. Some of them run fab shops, some run world wide performance companies, some of them pull wrenches like I do but that's where we all met. Nobody else I'd drive 1300miles with for a car show.
Let's see some cunning stunts 😂
problem is majority of volkswagen drivers are ass hats.
Bro, why am I just now learning your from Kentucky. Family!! I think I got a bentley if you need it!!
0:15 I think it's bold to say replicated JP Performance's golf is most definitely not a rep of yours. I think it was meant to be a joke, but well, I personally didn't think it was funny. Especially thinking of the work that went into that car and to say oh the wheels and colour look alike it must be a rep is, well presumptuous.
just bought a 05 vw gli blue lagoon, watching these videos makes me more enthusiastic to keep my car clean and authentic
Good old fashioned sittin-on-a-wheelie-chair-explaining-things video.  Great.
'92 GTi VR6 was my dream car back in the day. I had mark 4 golf but it turned into a money pit, then fell in love with subarus
I am from germany and i love them golfs up to the MK4 the MK5 looks kinda wierd currently building my Golf MK2 in to a Golf G60 im 19 years old and they are dangerous
What happened to the hachiroku?
Volkwagen , plain old boring cars for plain old boring people...    Never will i become a fan of VW  😅
VW is for phags. The best bang for your buck racer / drifter / burnout car is an AU falcon
i was already planning to get a golf and now they're gonna get more expensive... glad to see you're starting work on it again.
...I have already made my lifetime project car choice...
So basically americam vw community is taking all the nice people leaving al the douches in the ue ones. Nice...
About time to get back to cars. I got 2013 GTI because of you
There goes the golf prices lol
Im more of a corrado or an A3 sort of guy Vr6 for the win. Respond well to boost short wheel base 4wd whats not to like 😂
Hey James! I’ve got an mk5 Jetta tdi that I absolutely love! The tdi started my vw love journey (I’m a bmw obsessed psycho, I’ve got an e90 and an f30 335 😅) but I want to add another vw to my arsenal of poop boxes all cuz of your crazy build my guy! Thanks for the motivation! ❤
Can't wait for next episode
Gross
JUST LIKE YOUR EX....THINGS MOVED ON! We in Europe do nat waste our time with golf anymore.. you cant get a Renault Megane in US so get a Scirocco that is better in any aspect..
8:28 Cape Town 🇿🇦 !!!
Gotta disagree that the Japanese car scene hadn’t happened yet in the early 00’s. I’ve loved all sport compact cars since the mid 90’s and specifically Honda and Toyota. Used to go to the NOPI Nationals show every September in the late 90’s and early 00’s, and got Super Street and Sport Compact Car magazines for MANY years. There were tons of VW’s at those shows, but also huge numbers of Hondas. The Japanese car scene has been HUGE at least since the mid 90’s. Certainly since well before the Fast & Furious franchise.
The smog left in the garage is after running the engine is hilarious 😅
Love this video, made me laugh. You are spot on with the coolness factor! A friend of mine had an early one and I loved them ever since and finally found a super  clean Black on Black MK4 last year and bought it! All OG,  not the fastest motor but cool as fk! Thank you for sharing and look forward to the upcoming videos.
Cool video, I was in the scene in the early 2000s like you were saying it was big and the community was something else. All my friends were into it and I bought a 2001.5 B5 Audi A4 1.8t and they convinced me to tune it. Next thing I know other people driving something in the VAG is giving me head nods or waving as we pass on the street or conversations in parking lots about what stage turbo, brand of exhaust or who tuned the ECU. The police loved it too, I never been pulled over so much in my life and half the time I wasn't even speeding. Outside of my partially exposed carbon fiber hood I kept it looking stock, but I guess that was enough of a red flag for them. I still don't know what they were looking for drugs? If I was looking for drugs at the time VW/Audi wouldn't come to mind I'd think more like Hondas poorly maintained or modified
I’m working on a mk4
Calling JP-Performance's G3 project a replica is wildin'... xD
Here in Phoenix those mk 4 are cheaper and rust free 🤩
I would have it repainted (try to get a good price, not overpay) and tell them to additionally cut and weld new sheet panels under the rockers... the jacked up fender with the rolled and pulled job, could probably be massaged back into shape. If you replace it, don't get one of those LKQ ones, they never line up right.
I have a dormant project... too bad I wanna spend money on other things now, so I only have like half of the parts. I bought it in auction as "runs and drives" but a rod had melted, and a valve had collided with a piston and broken off inside one of the cylinders. It did still run and drive though, just not nearly as great as advertised lol And I had these friends who started coming around for free mechanic work during that time, and I told them I don't wanna do that and to go away!
Really Nordvpn... this is how I know yo ass broke
Got one like 6 months ago.   Beat the mob to it
Yes now its gone be more power baby
JP did not replicate your Golf mate... his G3 project is a completely different story with a custom built tube frame and a V10 twin turbo middle mount engine.
My mk2 golf is my forever car.  Currently a big turbo VR6 running over 400hp. I love it.
I think old VW’s and DSM eclipses are my favourite retro cars my all time favourite is the 3G eclipse, I grew up playing midnight club 3 and that is like the first car to unlock and idk why I just always loved the way that car looked the body lines the shape is all plain looking but I loved it
I had a 98 GL. It had the wierdest set of options I ever saw. It had a NA 2.0 with a 5 spd manual, four door. It had power door locks, manual windows, powered moonroof, and a 6 disc CD changer. I loved that car until the oil pump blew and killed the engine. A friend of mine had a 2002 that she drove too fast over a hill and when it bottomed out, it tore the oilpan off. She was able to drive it home and get it fixed. I would get another one.
As a castro... we dont scare easy lol
you could say all that about civics as well
Hi James, I'm from Belgium and I always loved the VW scene... I used to own a 1.8 mk2, loved that car... My brother has a GTI mk2 and a VR6 MK3 project. My mom passed away and she had a VW GOLF mk4 convertible with a 2.0 engine from 1998. Dark Blue with light leather interior... I still have the car but dont have the funds the bring it back to life. I parked it aside here in running condition but after +5years it wont start anymore. If by any miracle you like to ship it from here to your place to make a video about it be my guest xD would be awesome. I would like to see it running again one day. I used to drive it daily for 5 years before I had to move on to a bigger car because of getting kids :) anyways keep doing what you do buddy !
speeed
oh no the engine blew up! You should definitely not buy a vr5 engine from me because i am definitely not parting out my car!
Jamie is a legend.  Love when he showed us his wheel collection.
Please put a vr6 w2.9/r32 or R36 engine in her
The golf from jp is not replicated at all
Considering the US market as you guys are there.  Isn't a Honda Civic EG a better bang for buck? Speaking of D16Z6 as that's the best US has got.  Parts support, tuning, etc etc. The suspension.
Happy for you brother 🎉
It is 100% not the biggest bang for your buck lol
Civic 8th gen si is the best bang for bucks i paid 3k to be = to wrx and new gti lol
I went from a 91 vw Jetta gl Wolfsburg edition to a 03 gti with the never lose
good luck on the build
The mk3 dubs are truly one of the best all around generations, I got my glx for 2k and it’s absolutely clapped but for that price I couldn’t not take it. It’s been a blast trying to restore it and I’ve learned a lot. So much aftermarket support and all the info needed online, couldn’t be happier getting this clapbox😂  If I can save my chassis I think you can save yours too James lolll, don’t let all the history behind this car go!
If anyone needs a do it all car, the golf is the answer. The mk8  is meh, I’ve been watching prices, the mk7 is holding value and not depreciating beyond $15,000 ish. As I daily a mk7 (my first car) Vdub in the house! Unpimp yo ride!  Additional notes, the 07K is half the 07L 5.2L V10. The gallardo exhaust manifold will swap directly onto the 07K. Not sure about internals, but 07K swap the world.
Very nice. I've got a mk4 Golf wagon with the 2.0 petrol engine. It's always a nice drive! Cool to see what you're doing with yours. 🙂👍
The next project has to be a MK4 1.9TDI golf !! In South Africa these are absolutely legendary and man does that diesel engine sound sexy with an exhaust and a tune🙏
Hey, James. Guy from northern ky. First car i bought myself is my Mk7 GTI. First car I've modded is my MK7 GTI. I freakin love this thing. But I feel the same way. I loved cars before. V8s are great. But my mk7 smokes V8s right now (once I get traction anyway). So, I totally get it.
Hell yeah. PVW friggin rocks 🤙
Well i guess a few months later well see a golf/gti tax that James is personally responsible for..... Thanks James.
Not only am I super excited for this series, regardless of being a JDM lover, but I think James’ videos are the perfect mix of fun and professional. I love it. I watch loads of car guys on YouTube but James is by far my favourite content creator. Buzzing for this and a huge fan! Notifications are ON.
The dents are stories. The chipped up matching rims are OGs and from an era when car modifying was more and art than a function kind of thing. ...It's ok to be slower if the ride looks bitchin'.  I was more into the Nissan, but I always respected a VW. It was always a car that was a "owners choice" kind of ride. Not something just handed down from family. I am so glad you got it back!
Please dont let jp performance see this video 😅
So yeah…I have a 2010 Passat CC 1.8 tsi….I have a set of 19 inch very rare Lugano rims in mint condition..What should I do with my car?? What is the most wanted mods and what can I do on a limited budget??
I've been about that 5 cylinder since my mother bought a beetle with one in 07. Such a fun little motor.
2 of my supercharged VR6s were featured in Jan 2000 in PWV (alongside Nik Saran from VF Engineering). My contribution to the scene was to be the first one to do and E36 M3 style tail light conversion on the MK3. Good times.
He was a chubby, but now he's a hot guy 😍
Im so happy to see this car get the recognition it deserves. A Mk3 Gold saved my like. I was in the back right seat when a car t-bone'd us (Grandma, grandpa and myself) in a 60kmph intersection. The whole door next to me was impacted. My injuries? I bit my tongue.  My first car was subsequently, a 98 Mk3.5 2.0 Cabrio in BRG. FUCKING LIL WHIPPET, it felt so fun despite being not that fast, handled heaps well and predictably once I got the hang of it. I love old VW smells too, the fucken CRAyOLA VaNILla MIlkSHAke smell. When I was a kid Mum had an orange air cooled Beetle with a fake v12 badge, that's when I first remember that classic smell.  If I am rich, I am going to buy a massive garage and have a Beetle, Corrado, 3.5 Cabrio, and probs a classic Mk2 GTI.
That headlights are so rare 🥰🥰🥰
We've been getting the l'oe show roll through Pottstown Pa and it's been getting my wife and I hype about VW. I might be sold
6:12 as a german, this is quite expensive. You get them from a Grandma here for 1000€. And i dont get the point why they are dangerous 😂 It has an airbag, abs and seatbelts. Not like its from pre car safety times Schönen Tag noch✌🏻
Not a surprise really that VW Tuning got big in the US, it is one of the biggest tuning scenes here in germany as well... and has been for a good while longer :)
I cant wait for more 90s vdub build content. I was a mk2 guy but my best buds had mk3s. Even painted a plaid hood on one. We totally would've been homies!
I already have a golf mk4
Nah just buy something Japanese and enjoy the reliability.
After my pops passed away, I stopped working on all my cars and bikes. They just sit. Mazdas and buells. Just sitting.
So happy to see you happy James! Let's go Speeed!
11:48 - Didn't you say Performance VW was ONLY for Volkswagens :P ?   What is that Seat doing there?   *Just fekin with u! I know in later years they added Audi etc :), but back in the day it was for sure a VW only!   Do have to say, happy you have your old horse back man! Nothing beats the love for one certain car, can't wait to see what you do with it!
Bro, his face at 18:53 was like bro plz say something actually good about this car 😂😂😂
Can you also get a Acura Integra project car? Do it for the love of VTEC
I love the pace of the show James.
Cool. But the fakeness is really shining through
Speaking from Brazil here. The vw golf was the first car that I actually liked to drove. And it was my boss's car at the time. 😅 I had recently got my drivers license ( 14 years ago ) and he just gave me the keys and told me to drive. Man... You put a mk4 gti in the hands of a kid, with zero experience driving and there's two options: he either dies or fall in love with that thing. Luckily I got the second option. Last year I finally got my own and couldn't be happier 🙌🙌
Look how this Mk3 smoked a bunch of E30's.. we have a project car!!
Man bring the Golf back to Louisville and cruise it up to Tinseltown and up in the highlands and hit the Krispy Kreme meet like the old days lol
The car you call replicated is no longer a golf mk3! It is a completely new construction where a golf mk3 body is put on🤣 there is an Audi R8 V10 with twin turbo installed. That car is from JP Performance in Germany and is in a completely different league than your car 🤣
James just make a channel that says "im good at everything  and nothing at the same time"
There is a reason european enthusiast started avoiding anything from VAG's
The perfect show
Your voice in the video sounds distorted, you may want to check that out! :)
JpPerformance definetely did not replicate your golf, they build a kompletely new car out of the mk3, named g3.
Ive been watching alot of your old videos during my 2 hour commute to work. (well I listen lol) and i got to say: I fucking love you man
Big Time Speeed has a nice ring to it. Those 3 together would make for an awesome channel.
I’m all about supporting you and your channel but paywalling podcast/etc is a no for me dawg. Just keep doing your thing, the money will come. 🫡
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO BOYS!!!!! That smile at the end is what I’m here for ✊🏽
James, if I was a billionaire, your name would be on the inherit for sure
Duuuuuude i was a vw freak. Had a marrakesh Brown new beetle that won several competitons in sweden. Took it to a h2o in germany and had a damn blast
what about a cabrio u know a golf thats missing a roof : )  got one i tdi swapped nothing says love like rolling coal and not seeing cause its getting in ur face while driving
What about a VW rabbit lmk your thoughts
Corrado vr6 was 2.9 in Uk
Yo I'm drunk af typing this I bought a teggy gsr for 800 right before they got popular I put a under glow  and very few engine mods and paint i was going 190 in 90 zones just messing around now good luck finding one for less than 4k british columbia vancouver island
Quality James 👌🏻
im so fucking excited for this build
Calling the JP Golf of JP at 0:14 is a biiiig stretch I‘d argue. Love the car nonetheless
The honk before the light turns green 😂😂😂😂😂
****MIGHT AS WELL*****
*You circled VR6 engines in the animated segment and said "V6's". Those engines were the VR6 3.2 and the VR6 3.6.*  *I am the biggest fan of the staggered inline 6 from VW. I love them. They are far superior to V block engines.*
Those cars suck
Oh dang bud u left donut well damn guess I'll just leave a sub
the Jetta is called Vento in Germany
Put a v6 bitdi engine inside it. Be different.
The problem with these cars is in Germany (and other parts of europe), a Golf is screaming that your gf is probably 13 and you are pdf. File because most of VW guys here sadly are soooo your pro point dont count for europeans …
Love to see more of this mk3 and the finished work, im from a vw club down in SD,  VW NATION
1.8 20valve TURBO LYFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I relate to this so much, the Volkswagen scene from the early 2000s is to blame for my terrible and expensive car modifying habit that doesn’t seem to end  😢😅
So many people where I'm from own golfs but they dont really do anything with him other than lowering and straight pipe
Have my Corrado vr6 for about 15 years now.  Just bought a Golf mk4 25 year jubi gti to fix up.  (Rear ended, stood in a garage for 8 years, partially parted out. 😂)   but, only 132k km, rustfree, 3" exhaust and k04-001 turbo with bigger injectors.   1.8t never lose. 😅
Fucking hell you’ve lost some weight! Good lad.
13:06 dude I can relate so bad.  My first car was or rather still is my Nissan Micra K11 from 02. I crashed it in 2021 and had it sitting for a while, not wanting to sell it, despite the front being literally destroyed. After some time and saving up money, I bought myself another K11 for like 650€ (I think), pulled the good parts off of it, fixed all the bent parts on MY car with a hammer and a chain wrapped around, which my dad pulled with his Touareg, so that the front bumper and fender mount would get roughly in position again. We "rebent",  repainted and overall repaired the front frame, stuck the hood, fenders and bumper back on, adjusted the gaps in between and boom. Still own to this day, engine swapped it, lowered it, built a new exhaust for it, swapped the tail lights, built myself an rgb adjustable speedo.   And since I live about 1 1/2 hour away from the Nürburgring, we sent it flying across it a couple of times as well. Mega fun.   Even though it's an old and currently a bit rusty old micra, which not many folks tend to like, I won't ever sell it, unless absolutely necessary. My first car is very very special to me, experience so many cool things in it.  :)))
Timeless design by Giorgietto Giugiaro
What other company offers you a number of V6s, 4cyl turbo engines and diesel engines that all came in the same car? Opel, the natural rival of the gti :)
I will not be getting a golf project cz im already gonna get an e28 project and have an e30 project which is also my daily. Your goal of the video has not been achieved
It would be amazing if you can put the engine in longitudinal position and try to reach the 50/50 weight distribution and rwd of course.
Anyone remember the dude on vwvortex that only ever commented something like "It's in the manual" and finally got banned. I still remember his user name.
The mk3 golfs are known to get rusty. But your golf needs to be saved.
SHE RUNS!!!!
This is donut.... why did you guys delete my comment. It wasn't mean or negative.
i love my 03 gti vr6. has been alot of fun. 2.8 24 valve
0:15 JP did not "replicate" your golf
I work in infosec, a nordvpn sub is like a Virtual dunce cap. Complete Clown car of a Company
You talked about Golf and Jettas. What about the Mk3 cabrio? I have one 😢
in holland they are the garbage of the road only mdma gabbers that isten to harcore house are driving this stuff... no thanks no golf boom boom boom
I’d love to see a Sentra ser spec v on the channel
Hey James I’m Jimmy I’ll do my best to buy golf/jetta love you man hope to be apart of your community soon ❤
Currently going through this now with my 86 R31 skyline wagon, owned it for 15 years and it's finally now getting the remainder of the rust cut out and a respray, then the last two steps, upgraded gearbox and then turbo tiiiiime!
Seeing that golf with its original number plates reminded me of how back in the early naughties here in the UK it was thing to run German plates on German cars, until the cops clamped down on it of course 🙄
Get a MK4!!!!   They are by far the best looking of them all!!!!!!
My dude, Taking Back Sunday!! Yes!! Probably a little Dashboard Confessionals also!😉🤣
I've owned 2 GTI's, an '85 8 valve and a 2000 VR6. I enjoyed every minute. I love that you are continuing the legacy on your channel!
One of my biggest regrets is selling my 91 golf GTI. I blew the clutch and didn't have the money to fix it, so I sold it for a grand...
Taking back Sunday!!! ❤
I genuinely adore these vehicles. Ever since I got my 2nd car, an 08 Rabbit, I’ve loved the feel of every golf I’ve ever been in. They’re just the best big little cars, it feels like the perfect size through and through. When’s the next VW hatchback convention? 💙
If you think the 07K is cool in James mk3, VR6 is literally up top tier with 2JZ and RBs lol. Fastest VR6 in the world that I know has an official time of 6.77 which is built by Team HST. VR6s are so underrated, 2.8 iron block. You can slap on a turbo and make 300-600 with a stock block all day. All you need is head work and a better trans to handle the power. Even at 300+hp, the car will spin. VR6s also one of the best sounding and unique block design ever.
It’s funny that your first car was a Japanese car, but you are into vw now. I had a vw jetta for my first car and a Japanese car now 😂
I almost bought one as a first car but i fel in love with a peugeot 106 rallye still like the golf 3 tough
i've been kind of getting sick of new cars, they're so wasteful, we produce way too many and replace them far too often. old cars tho? based as heck, repairable, swappable, yeah they aren't as efficient and i'm a train nerd in large part due to environment, but preserving cars are worth it.
OZEMPIC 😂😂
At the end,  your excitement truly made me smile.
Dude, the lift your car went onto is almost completely empty on hydraulic fluid. Should definitely fix the leak wherever it is and fill that reservoir up. Made my butt pucker when I saw just an inch or two of black fluid in the reservoir lol
Шнурову делать нехуй
This is the video I that told me yt videos now have different audio tracks for different languages
Damn bro i think i might and I'm not a car guy lmao
I got a mk3 jetta. Love 1980s to early 2000s ❤
https://youtu.be/iONd9WjTu0c?si=3fJqgrSvuZLpErfa
I'm stoked to see you making new videas. I miss watching your up to speed videos. Good luck yo!
My mate got a VR6 Mk3 red colour-concept Golf as his first car, ended up meeting a lot of aussies into VW's who were on VWVortex, made a lot of friends and went on a bunch of roadtrips. Was the best of times!
I can't buy a old Golf, I already have a 96 Passat!
I was also on VWVortex, still am.. have owned multiple Mk2 and Mk3 and will have more again some day.
I’ve always loved this mk3.  Even more so when you motor swapped it. (Edited) wife and I have a lagoon blue mk4 GLI, stage II + and love it.  Gunna put ko4 in soon.
The video we wanted, not the video we deserve
The two door hatches always win my heart. I'd take a mk5 or an Audi a3 if ever possible dunno if they made them in the states though.
The problem is the German engineering. That and real volkswagens are air Cooled😂
Dude. So stoked on this build.
This is fine
Come to South Africa, you'll find your people.
That thing is a good 20 footer looker, I love it
I live in aus, I had a 4 door mk3, 2.0 turbo, I bought it with 43,000kms.. best car I ever owned until it got stolen and never found. RIP.
JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE FUCKING LOVE YOU!
I'm confused 🤔 dude you MADE that channel. Honestly you were the only reason I started watching donut and I won't watch another donut video w/o you in it lol  🤜💥🤛 I might just get rid of my S60 and buy a golf lol
"a golf with a butt" make a sticker out of that, I'd fn buy it lol
I have a 2014 jetta what should I do to it in the future all I have in it at the moment is a sound system
More of this please!
Under valued!!! Bro you can’t find one that’s not over 7k
I had a Mk III with blistering 90hp as my first car reliable af. After me, my mother and my little sis drove it. Was in our family for over 20 years. I love this car.
SO PUMPED FOR THIS!!!
MK6 owner here - but mainly Taking Back Sunday fan here - I saw that Louder Now CD! Big shout out to the Fred (best) Era of TBS 📣 3:23
Is this turbo kit for the 2.5 available or if not can someone recommend a reputable turbo kit for a 2007 Volkswagen jetta wolfsburg me and my twin brother have wanted to buy and build 2 of them to make 500-600+(probably only need 300-400) hp so we can get in trouble and have fun and do some bonding lol
Glad to see this revival! May not have really been the point, but aside from mechanical neglect, a good shape mk3 still holds it’s own against modern collision safety IMO. ABS was available, though most were not equipped, so parents and insurance companies might have something there, but at stock to mild power lvls I’d argue they are plenty safe. Biggest reason to not buy as a first car would be the upfront maintenance for reliability or the hassle of your kid getting stranded and repair as needed to a 30yr old daily.  I get being attached. Would probably be better in the end to pony up for a clean shell considering you’ll need full paint anyway and the best fix for rocker corners will involve donor panels from low to no rust cars anyway. I’m not aware of repro patch panels like you might find for other older classics. The engine might be rebuildable too, but for the cost of an undamaged 07k, is it worth it? Excited to see how the bores and chambers look, cause I guess that’s what it’ll come down to. Still a lot of great parts there to work with!
This video oddly enough gave me some motivation to get started on an off road Volkswagen beetle project! 👍
Holy shit James you’ve lost some weight! You look good dude! I’m happy for ya.
driving a gwagen while following his towed vw to a shop to mod it.
I had a MK6....i miss that fast little bastard
Sorry dude, I picked up a 1990 Eagle Talon Tsi for a project. But we can still hang.
NGL I clicked this vid thinking it was a bigtyme vid. I stayed for james
james seems to really like this German Civic
My cousin Doug said u were a BIG GUY car youtuber but you are a very NORMAL guy. Whats the deal !!
Hell yeah man excited to see what you do with it. i got a green 1995 mk3 jetta celebration edition I'm vr6 swapping this month And a 1990 golf. Always love to see 90s Volkswagen content. Good luck with the new channel👍
More horseprrrrrrrssss
my buddy is building a jetta TDI like a 91 and my god is that thing fucken sick! he just finished internals and he's saving up for a turbo kit. but holy hell dudes lovin the jetta life.
Guy is looking good slimed down. I can take you a bit more serious now also.
Donut watching these revenge breakup videos at 3am like 😩😩🤤
I'm big into Australian cars, v 8s , JDM ❤ anything rear wheel drive. Never owned a front wheel drive car in 40 years. IMO the golf series has always been the exception, it is 100% slept on in America and Australia.
Bunch of talk and wank. Par for the course, later
No…. Just no lol
Off topic but youre looking great lately. Just wanted you to know we noticed the weight loss and you seem a lot happier!
brooooooooooo
damn: "Legion of Zoom" would've been lit
I can attest to how amazing these cars are, and tho I was always too scared and shy growing up to really dive into the community socially, I’ve had legit 25 VWs up to this point (I’m 26), anywhere from my first 71 Beetle, my mk1 diesel rabbit, to my current project, my blown mk7 TDI project (GTD-type build)  These cars, while not super easy, will absolutely make you a better mechanic, and the joy you get from driving them, in my opinion, cannot be beat. Especially after you finish a timing job. Or god forbid; dpf delete on a fuckin mk7.
I got a MKIV Jetta VR6 as my project car, I call it my daily driver for the past 13 years.
I had the opportunity to almost get a 04 Golf wagon TDI manual with beige leather seats in 2019 however If I did I would have been super broke and in debt. Also I was still learning how to drive stick then. It had the most gangster look to it, I wish I had better circumstances to get that car because I know I would have loved it
as an ocean city resident i love you for mentioning h2oi :,))
Reason #6...  They fit big guys too.  😂
I had just the basic 4 door 2.0 one, man I loved that car. Fun to drive, comfortable, convenient hatchback, and they just have such a classic design. Sadly had to get rid of it because I couldn’t find an air intake tube that wasn’t broken and the ones that were in good shape were too expensive which I couldn’t afford as a student.
One of the most fun cars that I've ever owned was my old 2001 Jetta VR6 5 speed.
Have an 89 Jetta and 2019 gsw still love the Jetta more lol
Hell yeah brother. Drive the price of my clean 4 door vr6 swapped mk3 golf.
Obiwan carnobi is awesome lol😂
oh crap, now i had my 32th urge to buy an golf this year, my father used to have an red mk3, then a mk4 gti, i almost got an mk5 jetta, but unfortunately it only comes with an automatic in my country
welp there goes the mk3 prices😢
Already have one man and it’s a beautiful white MK7.5 GTI stage 3 gt2260 tuned by IE and yes she’s hated and loved because it’s a tough platform to beat.
I love this channel, I love you. So proud, man. Keep killin it.
MKV GTI is still one of the best driving experiences I've ever had. Sellers remorse for that car still goes strong 7 years later.
doing a 1.9 swap on a mk1 rabbit currently
man for calling yourself a car guy you sure as shit don't know shit about cars
Try less yapping and more working, video is twice as long as it needs to be
She's got good bones James! Now you've got a hall pass on the the back to front refresh!
Medium build!
ozempic james
I have 2015 MK7 am I still invited
I dunno, best bang for the buck is probably 8th gen civic
This makes me so fuckin happy to see someone get a win for once
My 2004 Golf is my daily driver. It's an unofficial project car because things just keep needing replaced, lol.
I would be your friend if I lived near you 😊
I had a Mk3 GTi Vr6 and it's the only car that still dream about from time to time.
Where can I get a vr6 engine for my golf 2001 project car had it for 3 years now no luck
Every few years something triggers people to flex their VW Vortex joined date. 😂
I’m stoked to see this project. I’ve never been a VW guy but have always had a mild interest in VW’s after seeing the local car club hanging out at sonic on the weekends when I was a kid.
I did not need to watch this video. Two years ago I had six VWs in various states of disrepair. I sold all of them and now have none. Have a large stash of parts still on hand but I don’t want to go down the route of building a car again. Damn you James.
Great!
Mk3 is one of my all time fav platforms
I used to watch Debadged all the time.
You talking with the engine smoking was next level stress for me. I had to fast-forward the video. The anxiety was eating me alive.
Right now my two cars are an mk2 golf gti and mk7 golf alltrack. Way different but both amazing cars. My mk2 is going 07k I’m just poor atm and my alltrack has been awesome with just a few bolt ons my station wagon hangs with Audi s4’s
Just finished 12v vr swapping my 96 cabrio.....love me some mk3 goodness
Unfortunately I am selling my mk3 2.0 Gti. Neee to downsize or I would keep it.
Was so pumped for this video…and it just became whole lot of talking. Do look forward to seeing the progress though
I loved my mk4 golf it was tdi but the turbo went out and my transmission broke so I had to get something new
Better address that rust first before is too late, I learned my lesson last summer when my truck’s frame caved in because of rust
oh and uh make sure to restock the japan went hard in 99 tees
You meant to say Honda never will vw will ever come close
any Castro Motorsports merch? Cause if there is ima need a shirt !
I still have my first car a 2000 golf 2door hb 2.0 8v need alot but I refuse to give up
Dont do this to me, man.... I miss my MkV gti so much 😢
We are so back.
I bought a 1997 GTI VR6 a few weeks before I joined the service, in 1999. It was great. Too fast for my 18 yo still developing brain. I bumped it against the speed limiter of 135 many many times… with a smoke in one hand.
I'm so pumped on this. I 100% agree one of the greatest car achievements of my life  was getting my car featured in PVW at H2O.  To this day, that was the most epic car show. Not only did it get covered in the magazine, but I was the cover picture for VW Vortex for over a week. I still look at those pictures in a pretty regular basis, and I still have the car.
That a full on shit box
Been rebuilding my 95 GTI vr6 since 2020. Neglected for many years. Just fixed the rust in the floor boards.
I had a MK7 GTI that I loved, modded, cherished and drove the shit out of. Fell on hard times in 2021 and had to sell, been saving up and I am a year away from being able to buy another one. Godspeed James.
at the end of the day they are FWD.  No thanks
Hey man, glad to see you popping up on my feed again after so long. Thank you for exposing me to the Fiesta ST btw, been loving mine for the past couple of years :)
Bought my first VW (MKV GTi) 4 years ago, and I'll never leave the VAG group - when it came time to upgrade my GFs car, we got a matching polo. It's been super fun and reliable.
5:18 I thought you said put that on arm and I don't think VWs like being associated with people's arm's anymore lol
Medium Build hat for the win!!!!
Love the content, and congratulations on almost 1.5 million views in a day
Bald red guy 😂😂😂
i have a 2003 Jetta 1.8t im working on that i bought from a buddy wohd owned it for the last 10 years. currently used as a daily and love it
As much as I loved your high energy doing up to speed, when you said “let me tell you a story”. I immediately loved the tone of the video. Can’t wait to see more!!
I always wondered why Donut never did a high low with a Golf
I’m not typically interested in German cars but this has some kind of gravity
Have a 2000 gti glx (12v 5s spd 106k og miles) I got over a year ago and man with every single problem I fix on it I just love it so much more and am excited to build it more
Dude.  So happy to see vids like this from you again.
I bought a 2009 5-cylinder Rabbit 6-speed for my daughter to drive in high school and college. It was a blast to drive, great low-end torque with great mid and high end power. The only downside was working on it. The parts are awfully expensive, and it took me 8 hours to replace the alternator...jeeze.
Ive just bought a 2009 passat tdi 4motion wagon that is a bit of a project, your making me want another Mk3 or Mk4 Golf now instead 😂
I LOVE my mk6 gti.  I picked it up dirt cheap with some problems but a solid body and interior. I would recommend them.
Because my brothers first "fast" car was a red MK6 GTI, my first fun car was a MK6 GTI with lowering springs and black spray painted wheels and dark tint and my license plate said DARK SIDE with a middle finger in-between the two words (hella cool). A timing tensioner took the valves out, after the motor replacement I traded for an alltrack and proceeded to slam that, and with that car I bought a 6MT W8 passat and threw thousands into making it run. I unfortunately no longer own these and daily a black GR Corolla, but it gives me the same happy feeling as my first black MK6 Golf. I may be on a JDM kick now but right here on my computer desk is a MK4 R32 model, even now the love never dies
Top comment is gay
If you live in Europe then yeah, do it. If you live in ooessay, dont do it.
bring back vortex
How is this channel not called Hersepers!
I have my good passat 4motion 1.9tdi 131hp from 2004. Bought it in 2013. Best car ive ever owned. Have ordred full suspension now from poland along with timing belt and all that. Im the only person that have a video about the 4motion fuel pump and how to bypass it and solve problems with it. THE ONLY ONE. i had to make it myself crawling in diesel on the ground for days.
Sick 🤙 Seeing those old PVW's brings back some memories... That snot green mk3 with the offset dice in the grille still looks fresh af 🤌
I love my 81 vw rabbit diesel 2 door hatchback 4 speed.
I have a golf. I want another golf now
Got a VW Vanagon with an MK5 and those little engines are just enough punch to have fun, even in a van.
I miss all my VW's  ( well the mk2's & mk3's F the one mk4 i had). I'm from Pa and met some of my good friends all because of my VW's. I don't get to see alot of them now but all would still come help each other if work was needed in a heartbeat.
Lets bring back the MK3 era fuck yea!
Wait what? I could actually  get to meet you and hang out with you ?🥹  wouldn't that be great !
bring the rust to a good shop in ohio they can make it look like new minus paint for like $100
You like half the weight i saw you at last!!! Good for you.
My first car back in 2018 was a 2008 golf city. The original owner had it serviced at the dealership for everything and undercoated every winter,  but still sold it to me for only 1200 bucks with less than 80,000 miles on it. It was near mint and never had a single issue while I owned it. Unfortunately I got rear-ended one night and the car was totaled, no car I've had since had that same solid handling as the golf, even if it was just the humble golf city. I'm hoping someday to get another mark 4 like it.
I miss the old 2000-2005 Vortex days man. And my MK4
man, vw in puerto rico are popular. i got a mk4 jetta
Man, i want another r32 now :(
It’s got rust lol no shit it’s a mk3…. And hands down the worst gen… I’ve had a mk2,mk3,mk4, b5.5 Passat and a b7 Passat but my mk3 was junk they all are rust bucket toilet
It’s got rust lol no shit it’s a mk3
Using Donut in titles for views is corny
Haha I love number 5 😎
Spthreeed
I've got an '82, Canadian model Volvo 244, and I can very much relate to James and the sentimental connection to his Golf. Mine is factory 'Tomato Red', and any reasonable man would have scrapped her based on the amount of body rust: holes in every wheel well, both rockers gone, trunk 'butt cheeks' gone, driver's side fender blown through, hole in the top of the rear quarter panel, etc, etc. But god damn it I'm saving that girl! Good on you James, I'm stoked for you and can't wait to see the progress you make on her. I can see that cover shot now!
If you aint rubbing you aint dubbin.
Castro should work on some New England cars lol
meth
its genuinely true man. yours and previously donughts videos are the reason for a spike in car prices. mighty car mods used to do it too when they were relevant.
I had to give up my MK3 a couple years ago(you used my video clip for the VR in the Donut Up to Speed on the GTI video) and I still miss it! I still don't have a MK3 now but I am finally back behind a VR6 with the 8p A3 3.2 I just picked up! This video is making me so nostalgic lol.
I've got a 2019 gti and absolutely love it
Maybe someone could answer but why didn't speeed and big time join forces
h2o 2007-2014 were the best times of my life.
Registered for the 'tex in 2000. Windsor Blue!!! Inari Silver!!! I love my Golfs and I am damaged but this is my life and it is good.
I've got a 83 Rabbit LX pickup with a GTI front end swap done.  love that little truck.  slow as molasses in winter but lets be real, how many times can you drag race a cop at a stop light and they never know?
Audi 3 series need love too cause they just a golf with 4 rings
Got me a 2003 VW Beetle Turbo S (MKIV 337/20th internals on these). no regrets so far. such an abundantly modifiable platform.
Haldex swap !!!!
I have a MK4 Golf that's rust free and perfect for a build. Being a single father i don't have the money to build it someone come buy this thing and me James Proud. 3:40 it's identical to the one in this ad...i even emailed Donut a few years ago asking them if they wanted the car for free just give me a shout out 😅
Hey man I gotta 09 rabbit if you have any suggestions on what I should do too it let me know
stopped sub with donut and subbed here instead, much better place to be
I have a mk3 Jetta TDI manual and it's got over 300k miles, I feel like so little people know about the beauty of these Volkswagens. Love it and it's fuel mileage I bought it 5 years ago not running for 700$ senior year and gonna graduate college with the same car with no regrets.
funny to see wasaga beach h2o footage
Always awesome when your waiting for the no it’s toast and instead you hear yeah we can fix that no problem
Might As Well… put that on garm!
my first car was a Mk 3 GTI blew the motor and got rid of it. i regret the decision to this day
All else fails, it has a future as a smoke machine.
Sick content my brother. PVW or bust!!
Can you please do TH Lines
Here in Germany the golf gti has become a meme. They are mostly asociated with the owners being interested in middle schoolers, nowadays.
Mk3 golf prices just skyrocketed
I'm in. Gotta see it through, brotha
Now Golf’s are not cheap 😅
When I was a kid, I bought a White MkIII Jetta off a dude who was moving out of country. It was in a minor rear-ender that damaged the grill, hood and AC condenser and I got it for dirt cheap. Threw on a MkIII GTi Hood and Grill and MkIV Hella Headlights and a conversion harness. Buddy's brother was in club H2O and gifted me a Neuspeed spark plug wire kit and Intake that he pulled out of his old Golf. My neighbor was a mechanic and he built me a custom catback exhaust with a Super Sprint dual DTM tip muffler. In my vo-tech automotive program, we threw in a Neuspeed short shifter, 4 wheel disk brake and Bilstein coilover kit. Just as I finished with that, Fast and the Furious came out with the Solo Cup Jetta. I have so many great memories of that car, all the friends that helped me work on it and the two girlfriends I got specifically because they loved it. Ended up rolling it down a hill, but still have the VW emblem on my bookcase
Im already for the next episode on making that VW Golf be like new .
If James gives me 1,000 dollars I SWEAR I am buying a golf over here in Mexico
We need Might as well!!! Merch
this comment will get buried but as much as i love you James, the newer generation won't see any value in these. they need a lot of work in stock form, they're fwd, they don't have the nostalgia 35+yr old men have for them, and more importantly you can't finance one and building a car in general is incredibly expense these days. most people, especially in CA, can barely make ends meet. and if someone does have money, they don't always want a project. having said all of this, i'd like to think I have a japanese version of this car, the EP3 civic. something about my little nugget just wants me to build the hell out of it but i know its a complete waste of money haha
wait till this guy hears about a 91 civic hatchback
James just increased the value of every golf in the US in less than a minute. Lol
You built one channel with your personality and  passion for cars. Here's to the next journey!
I remember being a kid and seeing my brothers friends with VW. Loved them ever since 😭🔥
Seeing James drive that G-Wagon, it is making me rethink getting a Cayenne Turbo.
My first car was an 01 vw golf that i bought from a greasy man with a mullet. The engine blew up 3 months after I bought it
Talking about lil crap about things you're passionate about is so fun I hope it works out for you
Dawg, if the garage we are listening to you from, is in fact your garage; sik.  Funny too.  If not?  You're gay.  Thee end.
3tc powaaaa on that wago
Maybe this will motivate me to continue my 84 🤔🤔
WTF Youtube.. In the past few days, I have had random videos change the language and I cannot change it back.  I wish everyone would just upload to Rumble also and I would never have to use the dumpster fire that is YT.  Is anyone else getting this?  No matter where I try and change the language settings it just doesn't work.
I had a mk4 with a 1.9tdi. It was a blast until it blew up. It was fairly easy to work on.
Waterfest > H2Oi  ….Stares into the distance….
No, they are not dangerous. Maybe by the faulty tests in ermerica, but they scored high and still do now.
I remember my father racing (in a golf same generation as this one) [with me and my brother inside the car 😂]  against a VW square gol from the 90s down a highway (😅)  I still drive to this very day. I actually own a vw today it is just not as cool as a golf. Good luck  modifying your golf James.😊
James calls out his discord members in the ad lol.
Diesel gate. Was a thing
Who’s the bald red guy?
3:47 what's the name of the car here?
#Uptospeed
VW MK3 lover in France 💙🤍❤
James having a g-wagon seems like some sort of crime.
I own a mk3 gti as well. My engine is toast right now too lol. Now I can watch your future videos so I can get an idea of what I want to do with it 🔥🔥
Hey man I am working on a nice looking 3d printed gauge holder as a replacement for the ash tray assembly replacement of the mk3. I would love to send you the parts. I might need 2 more weeks for detailing.
My brother died last year in an accident. He had a golf 3 GTi. That was his pride and joy but his death was so unnecessary becausea driver decided to overtake at the wrong time 😢
Dude I'm so happy that you're able to save this beautiful icon!! I'm rootin for ya that you can achieve the title-magazine-dream :3
Take it from me. I recently paid off my 2012 TDI 6 speed. Did the clutch, just finished the exhaust, tuned it, and since I’m a painter by trade, gave it a bmw 399 paint job. Added some og Artisios and a subwoofer. And even though I just got a 2020 mustang GT that is much faster, the golf still has such a charm and drives so leisurely, plus the mk6 interiors are very comfortable (especially premium). I spent the best 10,000 that I ever have in 2019 and barely hit 100k on the clock. This car has had very few issues, is easy to work on if you have the right tools, and even though it isn’t the fastest, pulls through twists and turns unlike anything I’ve ever driven and gets 45 mpg on the highway. Plus I met a lifelong friend at a very meet. Can’t go wrong with a golf
This is so weird, tomorrow I’ll be going to look at a mk6 that I might just end up buying. And this video comes up 😅 I guess I’m meant to get it now
This dude is so chill bro how am I just finding this channel lol
0:51 sold. Ill buy a golf tomorrow.  I actually just sold my 06 GTI monday...i already miss that $1000 shitter
its going to be amazing seeing this Golf back to its former glory!
Time to single handedly raise the prices of golf’s
I’ve got a little mk4 1.8t
If you were on vwvortex post your username. I’ll wait to post mine because everyone knows me from there.   Brad from 1552 is the homie. Back when the business was called VW Sport. Then 1552 and 1552v2 after. Scotto and Vin had a car club called Autokrieg and threw the biggest cruises in history the tristate  ny area. They had set routes around Long Island and had tons of people coming from the surrounding states.  Jamie Orr was the moderator on Vortex. The man that made RHD swaps popular back in the day. If you look at 3:59, the old screen shot of cortex you see the post by Eurostyle. That’s pics from Scotto’s cruise Full Moon Full Throttle.  I was on vortex from 99 till they sold it and it went downhill. Good old days. Yes, I have that dead stare reminiscing of the old days. Met a lot of great friends off vortex that are my friends till today. Kevin Black aka Lugnuts aka Lugtronics.  Paul aka VR6.  Sorry but I’m an mk2 guy. I’m on my 43rd. I’ve owned a few mk3. I’ve pretty much owned every platform with the exception of a 6,7,8.  I’ve swapped them all with VR6’s as it’s my preference. All my vw’s now are vr6. Mk2, mk4, and my T3 Touareg.
I swear the golf and me have to have it connected ways
Omg those were the days. Everything I learned about tuning and repairs was vw vortex! It's also how I decided to get a 1.8t instead of the 2.8vr just simply because it was cheaper to make 300 hp. Now I wish I had the vr lol and could put a turbo on it. For a nice 500hp
I see Mike McCoys Coupe and mk3 (rd shaved bay vr6). I also see Scott Mason of old Mason Tech’s old vdub in that montage.   And H2O got shutdown because people were coming with Japanese cars acting the fool. Waterfest ended because Englishtown closed. Good old days though. Reminds me that I’m old being that I’ve been in the vw game for 35 yrs. Back when Waterfest was a show Rapid Parts in upstate ny started in that dusty field. H2O was named and started by club h20. Back when you thought you were the shit if you had a club h20 sticker on your car.  Sadly vw’s aren’t popular on YouTube. I’m shocked this video has gotten this much views. I wish other vw content creators had a fraction of the views this videos has gotten.
I did a "might as well" and now my car is on jackstands :)
idiot
Bought my supra as my first car, had a mk4 jolf vr6 and when I got rid of it (destroyed the hell out of it) and bought a scirocco mk1 to replace it. Althogh vw wasn't my first choice it has been one of the reasons I love small cars and love  euro cars today.
I hated my 07 Passat timing chain broke and the engine was gone always left a bad taste in my mouth
we got a partial up to speed on vw or should i say up to speeed
dang i think i want a golf now
Don’t have a golf but I got a diesel vanagon so next best thing I guess 😂
Now H2oi is the worst event of the year 😂
I love the in the driveway talking to camera shot. It sets you up to be sucked into the passionate info dump your buddy is about to give you about this car. I love this style of video, I'm not a massive car guy but I am a fan of learning things from people who are passionate about them and James has that in spades, and I'm here for it.
vw 4 life baby.
the rust is expected lol, the reason you don't see mk3s anymore is because they all rusted away :(
Bald red guy? You talking about red skull from captain America?
FINALY back to the win win brother !!!!!
The manual TDI is SURPRISINGLY fun to drive!
I’ve had a few mk3 golfs and now own a gti 8v in flash red. Always been my dream car and finally own one 👌🏻
Whoops, I bought a rabbit instead : (
The sketchier the coffee, the better the WiFi?
i literally bought a 98 golf gti last sunday for $2k and i see this on my recommended lmao. did i make a good decision?
I take a civic hatchback or toyota hatchback of the 90s over a vw
Bro that TBS in the pic was great, still listen to it now and then at work. Be safe and prosperous out there brother!
Nice I have a golf mk3 sitting since 2015 just doesn’t run. Was thinking of adding bike carbs to it and I think ur video is a sign I should totally do it. Been saving it but yeah would be fun to hear it run again. Now I just need to source some decent Yamaha r1 carbs. Best of wishes from 🇲🇽 here they are big cultural thing too bc there used to be a factory so parts are a surplus compared to other makes and models 🙌
Or more broadly, just get a '90s/2000s VW. I got a Lupo, parts are shared across four brands, people are eager to help and every component has been documented extensively. Great project car. Any VW from that era is basically just a Polo with a different body and slight length variations.
My one and only back in the 90's was a GTI 16V...that was a fun little gocart after years of driving 4000 lbs America cars....
so the orginal plan after donut not a thing now. thats all i really wanted....
Are you Matts brother from Matts Offroad Recovery?
I love the MK3 but bruh, the VR6s are hard enough to find, we don't need more people looking for them!!!
I fuck with that make a scene shit!!!!! Copping a shirt next paycheck❤
My buddy got a 97 Jetta in good condition and it's been literally nothing but problem after problem, and on one drive, it decided that the engine mount, transmission mount, gear shifter, and shift linkage decided they're gonna go kaput IMMEDIATELY after getting the car running flawlessly, getting an exhaust mourned, and getting the check engine issue fixed.
I knew Mike Burroughs back in the early 2000s because of a TN based euro group. Super cool dude. Wild to see where he is now. I’ve been a die hard VW guy since my first in 2005.
19:20 put so perfect 👌
Doubt it.
James do not tempt me, I almost bought the 1982 TD-swappedI Rabbit Pickup my neighbor had for $500...  I can't afford the temptations...
16:00😂😂😂😂
Damn this channel has been such a let down so far 😞
Not sure if this was said. But please come out here to pa for the loe show in August
About 2 months into my first project. How do you keep your self from getting completely overwhelmed by the scope of an engine swap
<3 <3 <3 I miss my old vw now.
You love THIS car. Look up the Ship of Theseus  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus
stoppped watching 42 seconds in and left.
They were so heavy and underpowered and just poor when it comes to handling. Even the VR6 while rapid by the standard was not balanced and heavy That's not even mentioning issues with the gearbox
💪🏼💪🏼😎👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼💯💯💯💯
YES, dude!! Loving the new format and topics, but it is also SUUUPER rad to see getting back to what makes it all go; in a car where it all started for you! SPEEEDing ahead, my dude! Make Project Cars Coool Again!
1:41 made it sound like a tdi
Jajaja, no German car is the best 'anything' for YOUR buck 😂
Family
nice video concept . iam back on my polo 86 c 2f
I Love you
First car a loved was a MK4 Jetta 1.8T and learned almost everything I know about VWs with that car, now in a MK7 GTI and I love her. At some point I will get MK4 Golf and go crazy with it
Drove my Jetta Cup Edition to H20i in 2011 to get ideas for my 83 Mk1 gti. Had a blast. Dad of 4 now and I don’t have time or money for a project car anymore but I love your Mk3.
Great now I want a VW 😢 I don’t know how to feel
James. You should add AWD Powertrain to the wishlist.
o golf sapão OG
I have a mk4 VR6 Rave Green GTI and I love it, its my profile pic haha. Its only got a 138k on it and for a 2002 thats not bad. I repainted the hood and bumper as the clear coat was coming off and then I took the wheels off of a 2005 GTI, resurfaced and powder coated them and put it on it. I get compliments on it nearly everyday when I am out and about. Anyway love the GTI. Glad you are doing well and found your own way outside of donut. Keep killin it man!
Donut are such a bunch of losers now 😂
It’s people like you and the goons at donut that have made the car community flood with poser car people who eat up this type of garbage
Might as well watch those ads ! 😅
Hopefully big time and y'all are still cool! Love to see y'all colab! 🎉❤
I have a 29k mile 16v anniversary mk3 which I'm aiming to have finished just in time for summer for the UK show season. All the points you highlighted about the VW community, VW Vortex, the cars, and the scene in general are so true. Not another scene out there where everyone supports each other as much. I've got friends out in the USA through my mk3 and my mk2. Would love to ship it out there when its done one year for L'oe show to get involved with the US side of the dub scene. Never realised until relatively recently how much VW's are appreciated now in America, because of how much we love them over here, and thought the US scene was tiny in comparison. Can only wish you the best of luck.
Never in 1 million years would I buy one of those
love cars and all your content. Im just waaay to poor for any kind of car scene. maybe one day lol, I have a feeling a lot of gen Z is in this kind of position. I cant afford somewhere to work on a car when im gunna be living my my truck in a year LOL  Golf was always on my short list for when I win the lotto thou goddamn
I have a 2014 2.5L golf, does it have the same engine he's talking about in the video?
I don't know man, sounds like a build collab with the BIG TIME BOYZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
20:53 Man i hope i never see that on one of my cars...lifts up dipstick, exhaust comes out 😢
Hi! from europe here, my first car was a golf mk3 1.4l, i loved it a lot, i ended up buying a second one, a 1.6 GT crossflow variant, really rev-happy engine despite the low revs, i love it so much that i keep throwing money at it haha! these things are the best project car and also relatively cheap, but unfortunately not a lot of aftermarket support here on europe unless it's a 16v or a TDI
Add Vortex username: firewall ✅ old school member here
Just got a clapped jetta for cheap thanks james for increasing the value
I want a Mitsubishi gsx 99 those are rare to see now a days
Ive had a golf project before this video 😂💀 I’m so glad your starting this tho I have a 2.5l 2011 Golf with a lot of electrical problems original owner beat it to hell then parked it to sit for 2 years before I got it
„Replicated“
I daily drive a 07 VW rabbit 2.5 L 2D I've only upgraded the wheels with the GTI rims 😮
17:22 buddy was breaking up 🥹🥹
Hey James. Thanks so much for this video. Watching this brought back so many memories of me and my dad reading Performance VW in the late 90s and early 2000s. I have over 1,000+ copies of CAR, Top Gear, Evo, Autocar magazines boxed up. My dad was one of the founders of VWVortex. If you were there regularly, you might’ve seen or talked to him, VWLarry. It was his idea for the ‘The Car Lounge’ going back to 1997, there was the Crash, which meant everyone was re-registered to 1999. His ‘registered’ number is 34 💪🏻. Do you remember the running joke of Jamie Vondruska being a woman? 😂😂
immaculate vibes on this video. great watch
James finally decided to work on cars again
All used VW Golf prices are about to sky rocket on marketplace 😂
🔥
The real question is , does your mk3 smell like crayons?
You going to colab with bigtime?
Nooooo, damn it James! Don't tell them our secret!!  Cheap and awesome cars 😅
Thanks for the video, my clean little black Mk4 i've had listed FS for awhile has people already messaging me far more than usual.
love the VW scene, had several golf's, but now i have a Passat B3 -91 that i inherited from my grandpa who had it since -92 and i did a VR6 swap and alot of stuff to it like leather interior.
My friends has a Jetta 2.5se. That car has taken more abuse than any stock car I’ve seen and took it just fine with no damage. But yeah built those engines are nuts.
Vw vortex is so good even now im reading forums from the same year i was born 😂😂
No wrenches were harmed in the making of this vid
I need to show this video to my mk7.5 golf gte.
I dky this video kinda felt like a hoovies garage format
What I always wanted to do "was my first car" was take a 2 door soft tip Suzuki sidekick, lower it, chop the top and lower the seats, turbo or super and make it a street racing beast. I mean they weigh nothing and the high output JDM motor mine had had some get up and go, just the 3 speed auto and the way it was geared was great for off road but sucked for speed.   A few years back I seen a video of someone who kinda did what my dream was but not exactly
James, you and your MK3 are the epitamy of what Donut was - seeing that the rust problem is repairable and the engine being rebuildable, I think that that the next thing on this channel is: rebuilding a long standing classic, a true "bro before hoes" on four wheels - UP TO SPEEEEEED, ON, GGGGOOOOLLLFFFF RRREEEEBIIIIRRRRTTTTHHHH! *our beloved up to speed theme song starts to play* (1.4 MK3 Golf was my first car in 2018 and I still feel like that the chassis is awesome looking, the steering included with the steering wheel is just a notch of a upgrade from a real go-kart, and here in Europe, they maybe gonna last longer than the Gulf stream itself... it is not named after the stream though if I reckon correctly though)
Damn I miss h2o lmao
@2:06 its Bryce! I think this was on the way to waterfest 11? I could be wrong though, that was a long time ago.
Lol that’s not a lot of rust 😂
Oh man, it's been so long since I've seen James.
14:01 I crashed my mt07 totaled the bike and i thought I "Might as well buy a way faster motorcycle"(z900) I LOVE IT. 14:01
Mer hrspowa babeeeyyyy!!!!
My dad used to go to h2o it was fun(his car is my profile)
If you have rust. You should replace the floor pan and mite as well shave the engine bay....lmao I have an 02 jetta gls with a 05 jetta gli parts car both 1.8t love this hybrid I'm building fun driver for sure.
You can’t spell speeed without peeed
Looking good homie, can’t go wrong with cyan man.
Golfs are definitely one of my top choices. But man i freaking LOVE Clios
Thanks James. As if mk3 prices weren’t already high enough lol.
Watching this reminds me of all the good times spent in a mk3 in the earlier years.
I love my golf
Why do you look like Matt from Matt’s off-road recovery now lol 😂
How about this; you buy me a VW Golf, supply me with the money to upgrade it. Then we have a deal.
So nostalgic! I'm german and learned driving in an MK3 golf. My instructor was great: A rallye ace, got his instructors licence in the german army and besides car he was allowed to be a instructor for tanks and stuff. bone dry humor. good times.
James. This video was great Makes me miss my built MK6, lovely little 2 door I’ve been thinking about grabbing a 1.8t mk4 golf or a vr6 mk4  Now I’m damn near gonna blow up because I want one again
I LOVE MY GOLF
Dude, you have to be a lunatic to believe that vaginas started or even did any influence in tuning/styling scene.
They exploded in price range here in Denmark. 2 years ago you could get one in great condition for about 1200 USD, now it's ranging from 3000-20000 USD 😅
I'm sorry man but  that shell is in really bad shape. Definitely repairable.
Lets go! Super excited with ya!
I want to see more videos of this build please and thank you 🫡
7:07 ok totally convinced after this
First car i ever owned was a cherry red mk2.  Had cams, headers, was dropped with a set of chrome TSW's on it.  Lasted me about 2 years and had to sell it, always was a dream of mine to find one and rebuild it.  Might have to do it now that this video coming out.
Golf? Naw I’m good
James knows wassup. I'll be at whatever golf car meetup you host. Sincerly the proud owner of a lowered Golf Sportwagen TDI (aka the grocery getter)
I loved Performance VW. I had like 20 posters on my college dorm wall from that magazine.  Also H2O was like the Woodstock 99 of car events. Went there in 2013, and it was crazy.
Nah, James is not looking as happy
Number 4. Commuinity.
Also, no homo James looking good, healthy and happier.  A pleasure to see
GAhhhh I love James so much , but I fkn hate VWs
In Mexico we call the VW fan boys "Vaguetos", they don't have good rep, and also are know to mod (in a bad way) their cars. So one of the worst cars you could get is a car that has been  "Veguetiado" (Verb version of Vagueto lol). Anyway I have a MK5 GTI, best car ever.  Get a GOLF!!
Careful on that noise gate boys...
What the hell is a discord? Where the hell is your dad James?
You’re never gonna convince me to get a golf but I’ll watch you to support you lol
You forgot to mention that it was in Forza Horizon 5 the computer game.. right? RIGHT?
I have a Golf 3 VR6 syncro full options and original. And love to talk about it 😅
The only Golf I want is the GTI W12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9TjPGY-38M&t=1s
Hell yeah. Killed it on Spike’s podcast. Hope to hear you as a regular
Vr6 is the best Motor there is
Make VW and Audis from the 90s great again!
Anyone else notice the "Commuinity" typo in the slide, right after he made that 4th point of 'Community?' Haha No? Just me? 😂😂 Okay
please do more dub content! I love my mk1!!
Mk1-MK3 golf’s are great but it’s really difficult to find one.
I have never heard of a Jetta being described as a Golf with a butt and I'm here for it! 😂
VW mk4 TDI BEW PD 5-speed manual wagon owner checking in.
You are awesome dude! I really appreciate the golf love. Half way thru my build. And my wife loves you ❤
>"seven years ago i've bought this golf"  damm, i feel old now
dude, have you started running? looking good and healthy
bought a mk3 for $800 on marketplace as a first car, it was definityl worse for wear and needed some love, as the 1.8L variant it comes with a whopping 90hp however i was instantly suprised  by the way the car handled itself and how revvy it felt. I love this car never selling it
I have a love hate relationship with my mk5. I can confidently say that I have learned all about working on cars since buying it 5 years ago. The interior is also incredibly cheap, but who needs a headliner when you have heated plaid bucket seats.   For the VW nerds... mine is a 2009, the single model year in the US where they offered the 2.0 TSI motor, the same that was used in the MK6 in 2010. This was because the MK6 came out in Europe in 2009, but we didn't get it in the US until the following year. The 2009 MK5 is essentially a MK6 underneath with a MK5 body.
More hrsprs baby!!
James is going to single handily raise the golf and gti market  edit I didn’t get to the point where he talks about that
Vw golfs are just too slow to be the best project car rn. You can get way faster cars for way cheaper
Not me eating lunch on my Mk 5 Jetta getting hyped
Looking forward to this project!
Cash for clunkers killed all of this
Do a video on watches
MK3 is the fastest rusting golf. In Europe countries with winter and salt on the roads they are rare because most of them have already rusted
Huge fan of the “might as well” theory
YEEAAAH MO POWAH BABEH *LIGHTNING LIGHTNING LIGHTNING*
bro i still have all the euromags from the 2000s when they had the stretch out tires on old golfs
I have a 97 passat and I want to get a 07k into it.. id hope I can crusie with you someday my brother
Golf/Jettas are sick but where are my Corrado fans at?
Wait, are you not with donut anymore?
Love you man !! inspired me to start bilding my 350z and start working on it myself
New hampshire car scene is 90% vws and I love it. Pop out this year for SN and BTM meets Concord to laconia
Man I miss h2oi 😢
Hittin 2 step with these 1.8ts are heaven!
Great cars...or, used to be. Have had too many VW owning buddies tell me about horrendous issues with electronic gremlins that were either unsolveable or hugely expensive (i.e. replacing the entire wiring harness from front to back)
I LOVE MK4S!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Didn't know bro wear clarks
Interesting.. I subscribed.
Mk2 Gang
i miss my 09 5cyl rabbit best car i ever had loved it.
rust... ahh the golf 3 experience
Yeah this looks like a Donut rebranding
Got a 2004 VW Caddy TDI . Any of those in the States?
Swap for a 3.6L VR6 Turbo 🤠
Shout out from a mk4 golf owner in Surrey UK
Haha 2:09 When the Golf is spoken of, the polo is always somewhere in the background
Can’t wait for more eps on this, always loved golfs. Might need to pick one up after I’m done messing with the XB.
Car magazine..the magazine that cars were named after
Few cars look as good as the old 90's Volkswagen Gol.
My second car, and first I've ever loved, was a pristine, garage kept 2003 tdi jetta. After a while it went into limp mode and my dad sold it. 2 years ago I bought an old beat up r title 2001 golf tdi with 320k miles. I dont know how to do anything to it, but I've been wanting to change the interior and make it black leather. But I hope I'll learn
James bro You are skinny now. Gg
Collab with Scotto when? Looking forward to this build!
Cost of parts, and reliability.. NOPE, ill take a Japanese or a Camaro. If I was a Ford guy, Mustang's are better in a nimber of ways, but im not a Ford guy sooo.
8:24 little mk2 got snuck in there when talking about the mk1s
Great video :)
ABF>rest of Mk3 🤣
I have an mk6!
James i have a Mk4 gti on bags please notice me💔
I love your content, glad to see you doing it apart from Donut. Keep rocking!
W
my parents had a red vw gti mk1. bought it from both of their savings when they were young. they took it to italy and it got immediately stolen from a "supervised" parking lot.... ended up 5km away from the hotel crashing head on into a young couple on their drive with the perp getting away and a tragic accident :/ cant recommend going to italy with a car
Throw away! It's gonna be a deep money pit!
Watching this video with my mk7 wagon: 🙂
I wish i had  one, but these cars are fkn beautiful and economic. Lots of fun in a small package.
i have my 2013 r sooo much fun stage2+ rn and it pulls
Big VW fan. Couldn’t afford a nice low mile GTI, but I’m a happy CC owner :D
Take that, NOLAN!
I was always an American V8 muscle guy, but i remember my buddy Dave getting a little mid-eighties Jetta Wolfsburg Edition from his dad, and man.... changed the game for me.  They little thing RIPPED. It drove like it was on rails (WE were typically on rails, but i digress) and that little 5 speed took more abuse than i could even conceive of, and just kept going.  That thing was a blast. It got me out of the "there's no replacement for displacement " mindset, and convinced me that smaller cars could be a lot of fun, too.   Looking forward to seeing you work thru your project
WTF are we unc now if we remember h20i as the good ole days?
Love ya james. Because of you I got into Donut's Content with your Up To Speed videos and seeing you finally bring back the VW is a sight for sore eyes. Can't wait to see that baby rip up the streets again. Stay strong!
Great video.  once you are finished with the Golf, please do a series on the white G-wagon that you were driving
LFG!!!
Mk3 community took a hit when Smith left, good to see more
I just bought a mk7 golf gti and modding it now, I did intake straight pipe and getting rims and lowering it soon. it’s one of the best platforms
Very pro bmw guy here and honestly I’ve been loving and feeling more the VWs more and more lately… I would love to own one
Man listening to the opening of this and how the VWs not only affected your life but how much they and the members of the community mean to you feel so close to home dude I came for the Volkswagens and I stayed for the VW family #38_four_40
the german audiotrack is horror lol
i just love cars but cant do anything about it can we make a video on a beater teggy i def was told alot of bad about vw but always wanted a gti
Dark matter is a FANTASTIC book!
As a project car VW owner. I loved this video lol. I got my '07 Mk5 GTI for $800, because the owner blew the motor and had no knowledge to fix it. Luckily I was buying it for a project car. I related hard to the "might as well" cause thats exactly what I said when I decided im putting forged internals in now, since I already have the motor fully torn down. Even though the current parrts would be fine to use, I want this thing making around 350-400hp
Mk1madness and Roots Classic forever!!! Please come out!
My first car was a 94 VW golf. Hotrod Matte black finish paint me and my father did. Was a great car!
Yes she was beautiful at Loe Show can't wait to see it back in the spotlight
nice steer more people to VW when people are already asking 2X their value for a 1.8t mkiv. now even more people are going to be looking for them. most are ruined by high school kids now
1:42  that blown engine sound 😂😂😂
0:30  yowwww how the man a deal with the Clark’s suhhh jah jah 🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️ James take it easy on the Clark’s dude
Dang I haven't been on VWVortex in a HOT minute
"This is a LOT of rust"  * Laughs in Chicago *
THIS! This is the content we want.
bro lost it at 15:55 🤣
They kept it from him?
1.1 mil in one day is beyond insane
I have two of those one three and one five door, one is more rust than actual golf, but for me the MK3 is the best gen, then comes the 7.5 right behind it.
Oh man, you should come to Brazil, here people are really crazy for vw golfs, gols (yeah, gols) and VW in general
0:40 aaaand any of those mk3's that were cheap and totaled on Facebook just shot up 5k+ and became unaffordable for normal forlk off that comment alone. Love watching automotive youtube. Hate what it does to the community and market
I’m willing to bet they’re just going to grab another $500 5cyl engine core to build because it would be a lot cheaper to build than fix that engine.
VW Golf is underrated here in the US. I have one Golf Mk4 race car also, I am finishing my other Golf Mk2 track dedicated. I love spanking Honda ass. 😂😂😂
You can’t say the engine core is still ok and rebuildable without pulling it apart and actually inspecting it. What a fucking idiot. Never take your car to this dude again.
Soooo here for this. The mk3 vw’s are so clean
Don’t keep running it with it knocking and supposed ring damage. You’re going to make it unusable. 🤦🏻‍♂️
contact Vin antra
The amount of assumptions made by this so-called mechanic are crazy.
This video comes out right after I bought a very cared for Golf Mk1
I had an black MK2 Wolfsburg edition...and I got rid of it cause it was an auto. I got it for 500$ wish I still had it.  Top young to feel up to the conversion. So pumped for this build
I dont think jp performance copied your car
I’ve really enjoyed the Speeed content so far but I feel like THIS is what we’ve  been waiting for.
I have a Mk3 golf, this’ll be so sick watchin this series
You should defenitely connect with Jason Cammisa
I'm from Portugal and my first car was a blue MK3 4 door 😅 had the worst engine (1.4i) but loved so much that had 2 more 2door, one TD and one GT TDI
Common guys why the GTI's are so much cheaper than here in Germany 😂 If someone needs parts. As a VW brother i try to get them in Germany, ofcourse i dont wanna earn on that. We VW driver help eachother:)
love 90's golfs, im thinking of building a 4motion golf mk3, sadly i know that the Top Gear magazine came out decades after the tv show top gear started on bbc2 in the uk
Glad to see you back
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I have a 2004 audi TT pretty much just a nicer golf 😎
Worthy for pvw I'd go syncro or 4motion swap while fixing the rust that way you can replace panels and seal the whole undercarriage properly not to mention actually be able to put the power down after going fordged internals built motor
I’m so stoked to see this!! been a big fan man, you commented on a porsche 911 video i made on tik tok
I don't know why, but when I hear about front-wheel-drive cars or automatic gearboxes, my brain just doesn't care at all.
What's up with the donut mic ;)
Bro in bulgaria this is the most popular vehicle.
my mk7 golf TDI  is due for a tune up, the warranty was extended because of diesel gate, but thats gone now so >:)
Hey James, I'm the proud owner of a Mk5 R32 here in Australia, I reckon they're one of the best first cars someone could get. Unfortunately we didn't really get the 07K engine here, and our modification options power-wise are really really expensive, basically doubling the cost of the car to just buy turbo kits. However, I hope to one day push 500HP through the wheels of my car, maybe through a DQ381 transmission instead of the stock DQ250.
Should have used Big Times truck to transport the Golf xD
...logs back into Vortex for the first time since 2013 - finds old build thread and subsequent part out thread - cries uncontrollably 😭
Between Donut, Bigtime, and Speeed, I am just swimming in the content I love.
cool car but golf's and most vw are wackk
5 minutes of cars and 20 minutes of commercials. Great video ..............
I miss my golf, I had 3 golfs, a gti, and a GLI jetta all MK3s
And I thought Joop and Subaru cars as personalities were Odd... while this is the car that created all the stand cancer in the car scene. I mean, at least is not an Audi?
VWortex was such a big help during the early 2000's when I 20vT swapped my Mk1 Scirocco.  I just spent about 100 hours fixing rust like that on my sons dream daily that is a manual IS200. If I can do it with decent results as a diy'er then you guys can definatly do it with great results.
James single-handedly has convinced me to buy an old Volkswagen. He’s right, too, those boxy ‘80s-00s VWs have me feeling my some kind of way.
Like you said, MIGHT AS WELL put forged internals and make 650 hrsprs
Good to see you back and looking good. Weight loss has been good for you. Congratulations!
I never should’ve sold the Mk6 GTI I owned! Drove it from 10k miles to 190k! Fantastic car! Getting another one is definitely on the list in the future!
Don’t need convincing to get a golf project, my thing is I don’t have money for a golf project lol
GOLF BEST CAR!
I have my golf with a butt project (MK2 jetta) and have been building up parts to do the 07K swap. This video is an inspiration and I am following along with you James. I am Canada, so not sure we will hang out in person, but I am  happy to watch these videos.
I have my 1st place trophy from H20 hanging in my office. ❤
James, it's so awesome to see the life on your face throughout the videos on this channel! It truly looks like you're getting to do what you love and you do it so well! Excited for this project. Side note, I've been driving an '07 Rabbit for a few years after my old car died, and it's really exciting to see my car/engine mentioned on car channels for a change 😄
aaaaaaaaand the price just went up 50%. nice. glad you can sell your car now
I just discovered Donut last year when I bought a $1k delSol with a B18C swapped into it and I wanted to start learning about JDM stuff.  I started binge watching your donut videos and followed you into you personal journey when you parted ways. Your personality has inspired me to be more personal in my own videos going forward. You’re good people in my book, keep up the GREAT work, home skillet.
bruh put a 1.9TDI in it, best engine
3rd time watching this video lol I love the way James speaks and narrates this. Editing is top notch too.
The hype is real
I got a ‘09 rabbit after my subie got smashed by a tree. It’s supposed to be a stepping stone car, but it’s very fun and I’d wanna do stuff with it, just don’t know where or how to start. Only recently got into cars so I feel confident anything I do, it will blow up
I should really finish my Mk3. Last year i couldn't even drive it, medicaly speaking. It's one of my favourite cars ever. I got mine for about 3000 EUR, but in a rather rough shape, incomplete project. Fixed some stuff, other stuff is yet to be done. Can't wait to go to car shows with it. I got a literal pile of parts ready to be installed. It's gonna be really cool after i'm done modding.
8:15 Modernlines 😍😍😍😍
2:40 , lol I still have that Audi A2 and its red 😂
Mjamjam
H2Oi circa 2014-16 lmaoo those were some good times
Convert to RWD or go home.
Am I allowed in that discord if I buy a Corrado?
Dont do this to me i just bought a b7 a4 when i already have a gti 😂
Currently sitting on my 4th Mk4 Golf and I still love them. With a good suspension and some wheels they handle so nice, the diesel has some nice power and it is reliable af. Now saying this while sitting on my 4th is something, i know, i had some bad decision and i am sorry for my first one... Sure they are old by now and have some issues, but man, if you want to start with something and learn how to fix things yourself, the mk4 is propably the last one you can get and do it. Maybe the Mk5 is fine to work on too but man, the mk5 is kinda not a Golf xD The 8 also, both kinda trash.
I have my Mark 4 since 2017. Had many issues with it. Always fixed it. Just never wanna sell it. Maybe i'll buy another car but still won't sell my mk4. Just so many memories and still drives like new. (1.9 tdi 4motion with 430k km)
My first car was a VR6 Corrado, and I met my closest friends in our local VW club back in the late ‘90s (Volksport).
i had a mk3 station wagon as a first car, and even without tuning it is the best starter car and fixing things is very easy
in Ireland there are so many people into vws mainly diesels we modify jettas boras golfs and passats
If the Jetta is a Golf with a butt, whats a Corrado?
My first car was a 99 jetta vr6. I didn't know what i had and drove it until it couldn't anymore. I still think about all the fun i had with that car.
This golf is like the american version for the french 1000tipla from vilebrequin
Paid 800 for a 02 saab 9-5 aero wagon 5 speed, put tires on it and did 150mph in Mexico the next day, in comfort, and far better reliability.
No man. The 2011 mustang with 5.0 is the greatest project car. They sick on bags, they are Hella fast stock, insane with forced induction
Lame horse it
You should see the Veedub diaspora in Mzansi (South Africa)!
wow interesting to know that all those guys were on VWvortex, as i was too young to own cars and be in the culture when these were new or semi new. As I still got on VWvortex to ask for help on my '88Cabriolet and '99 Cabrio, it would be interesting to see how the community was back in the day as now its kind of dead
Can’t imagine thinking a 4 cylinder was the best bang for my buck for anything other than gas mileage. You’ll struggle to catch a stock LS6 car after a 10k dollar build
This video popped up on my home page, and I’m so glad I clicked on it. I have loved Golf’s since I first saw them in NFS Underground, but I’ve never owned one. Might just start looking into it now 👀
Buy 90s civic put k20a throw a turbo on 500hp......
Why do you all keep watching this guy.     All he does is scream and make weird noises. Like a 3 year old screaming "farts!!"
I'm a fucking weirdo and think the B3 Passat is the best value.   It's also cheap, more likely to be better cared for, turbo diesels aren't uncommon the 16v was the base engine in a lot of markets, and you can get a VR6 as well. They're based on the A2 chassis and fit a lot of A3 parts, they look amazing when slammed, and parts support is still good.
1 million views in a day. we're so fucking back
omg this rust - you too are brave ha. Don't kid yourself.
Ozempic doing its job
My 2012 Passat has a 2.5 with 208k miles these motors are also impossible to break (as long as you take care of them)
Can’t wait to see this thing rippin’ again :)
Im sorry Im gonna keep my cobalt ss. I love that supercharger and they are cheap on another level. I blow the engine ill get another for 800$ I damadge the chassis  Ive got 2 spare chassis sitting on my parents farm cuz I got them for 400$ each. Like thats just another level of cheap
I'm down to build a MK3 with a plumbus swap.
I just took over a rural shop with a not running 2002 Jetta TDI complete bucket sitting there with a title in hand. Fuel system is bad. Been sitting in the desert for god knows how long. Bad paint and everything. No rust though.   Should I revive it?
Hell yes! This will be a great series.
I dont see ys hanging out much but if that were the case then you're just gonna have to be happy with my old ass Z31 cuz it's mine and I'm not shifting to any other platform. Golf is lookin like a fun way to go, I've just never had anything VW and only one German car ever, a w12 260E Benz that dumped oil smoke when it ran lol
Prices are gonna go up like the Miata
How can I join the speeed discord?
dammit james ive been tryna buy a mk4 golf since I was 16 and now it's gonna be even harder for me to get one
The oil cap doing a dance because of all the blow-by killed me 😂 This build will be really fun to watch I’m excited
05-06 07k had a chance for forged crank gotta drop the pan and look at the crank!
I will always be a mk4kid
VW actually has a copyright on that shape
Ive been a vw guy since i was little, first car was a mk1 golf and ive had a polo, 2 mk2’s and currently i have a mk4 and mk6 gti! The community where in from (the Netherlands) is very big and has made me alot of friends. Also alot of people talk shit on dubs (i kinda understand) but in the end they are just cool fun cars and seeing james’ mk3 come to life again makes me happy
I really like my BMWs but one of my first car was a 1991 GTI 16v Mk2 with big bumpers I loved that car and traded it for a high mile B4 S4. Huge mistake 😂
Wooow finally found your channel! Enjoying your voice again! thx for pushing this hard to start something on your own.
I have never been obsessed with VW but never disliked them and I secretly really want a VR6 Mk4. But I’ve bought 3 Minis instead (2 R53s and a F54). Am I wrong? Have I been playing for the wrong team?
Way ahead of you. I bought my 05 GTi in 2012 in California. Has never seen snow(back in Michigan now). Has some light mods and only comes out of storage in the summer to hoon a bit. Once I have my own place in that ever retreating moment of 'someday', I am going to build a piping hot hatch.
Got a seat leon 1.8t 20v. Its a damm goed project car
Doing amazing keep up the great work 🎉🎉
Wait. Is this a car channel now? Always knew it would happen eventually
So stoked you can save it! Had me worried there 😅
Call the membership herspewr or however you say horsepower
Hell yeah dude! Can’t wait to see you polish up that turquoise gem! (I know turquoise is not a gem lol)
Calling JPs G3 a replica doesn`t sit right with me...
Love the golf but.......do you have the E30 that you built with Castro? I would LOVE to see more about that.
Dude, are you trying to claim that in 2001 "Japanese car scene as we know it hadn't happened yet"?  Doriftu isn't the only Japanese scene, jesus.  I guess all those tuners modding the bejesus out of Civics and in mags like Street Tuner didn't exist?
13:19 what flew off the car when the engine blew?
Don't  forget the best friend of " might as well" wich is " while I'm in there" or " if I'm in there anyway I can...."
0:15 no for real... JP Performance has no fn clue who u are... relax
Only thing better that James being reunited with his Golf, is James being reunited with his dad. 8/10 wholesome.
ayo stop blowin up the spot.
the crazy part seeing this video today is I was just talking to my buddy yesterday about getting my back in the garage this weekend so i can start working on it again
Wait a second that car was from Karlsruhe that is sick 😅 Greetings from Karlsruhe City, Germany  ❤️
The good old 1.9TDI engine is basically a legend of the 90s and continued to be built well into the 2000s. In its final expansion stage it had 131 horsepower ex works. JP Performance has tuned the unit to 500 hp. It was installed in many vehicles (Passat, Audi A3, A4, many Skoda and Seat models, for me the best engine. Greetings from Germany
Congrats James on all your achievements and securing custody of the Green Weapon!🔫 🚗 I've had more VWs than any other make combined. Once I got my first, I just couldn't look back. VW life forever! 🙌
it had plates from Karlsruhe, Germany (red ones, KA*) at one point? that's in my area :)
if you want a golf then watch garbage time. changed my mind on wanting one.
Come to South Africa. The Mk1 is a staple here.
Sorry James, I work on VW's for a living. I'd never buy one.
not buying golf. fwd 🤢🤮
My car 'collection' just increased in value immensely, thanks bud :)
Wanting to get my hands on a manual B7/8 Audi A4 with the 2.0t and quattro as a project car. Preferably the B8 for the 40/60 front/rear torque split. I know they’re pretty heavy at around 3,600lbs but my car right now is a 4th gen eclipse with the v6 and that thing weighs the same and is fun to drive with just 260hp at the crank. Easier tuning, more power potential, and awd seems like a really fun upgrade to me. Is there anything I should know about these before hand? Please chime in :)
Ive got a mk 1 AUDI TT 1.8t 225 Quattro  In all honesty people if your a VW Audi Enthusiast you can pick one of these up for cheap and they are worth every penny got a beautiful blue grey TT with a unique blue leather interior
I remember the days of the car scene segregation haha. You have the Domestics the JDM and the Euro crowd. And we all hated each other, but kinda got along just alot of ball busting haha.
It doesn't matter what some bald .. red guy says on the internet...  Bill Burr's podcast is also available on spotify
Who is donut?
Former MkV gti owner here: biggest fkin money sink I’ve ever owned.   I would strongly advise against getting a Golf.  (However, if it hadn’t given me so much grief, it would also have been one of the best cars ever made. When it worked, I loved it.)
Always liked donut and all the guys, cool looking car. But the only way i could get one is if it was kswapped 😂😂
talking to someone from Europe here.. They are not special, you see them EVERYWHERE. Good cars, very trusty cars and very potentional indeed. But they are nothing special here :D
Love Humble Mechanic and ShopDAP.   I always knew I liked the Golf. I always picked it in NFS as a kid. I finally got around to getting a MK7 GTI a few years ago, and I still look at it and get excited to drive it the same way I did the day I bought it.   VW is where it’s at. Such a great, well rounded car. It’s practical, good on gas, but also peppy and handles like a go kart. And the aftermarket support for it is great. A little flash tune and it makes 300hp. Not bad for a 3,000lb car.
I think we should create a quest to get James a bright green microphone with a cool pop filter.
Love it, i had multiple myself. But i'm also a VW certified mechanic  Greetings from Germany
Someone buy my golf 2002 VR6!
Been working on a mk4 Jetta ALH tdi project for a while now, these cars don’t get the love they deserve, truly great cars that are fun and cheap. No matter what they will always look good, timeless design.
I have a 2006 golf tdi 1.9 , manual transmission and did a smyth ute pickup conversion. Is best compact pickup ever👌 . 48 mpg, tows 2000lbs, 1000lbs bed capacity. And gets constant attention .
0:15 Bro really thinks JP Performance mean to replicate his golf..😂😂😭
James, you look incredible.
Kinda excited to see this. I’m a Honda guy, but I love 2dr coupe and hatchback manuals. And the Golf is on a “potentially will buy” list.
00:15 Naahh bro xD JP didint replicate shi.. of that Golf haha... also it hast way more power, and its completely build.  ur car is nice.. but u cant compare ur car to jps golf lmao
I’m not sure about the golf. But I do have 2 Jettas and a eurovan. I’m probably gonna do an 07k swap in the eurovan if the van is worth keeping but it was severely rusted when I parked it 3 years ago after the reverse gear went.
My GTI is the only vehicle that has ever been complimented by a girl 😅 that's definitely the truth
I gotta mk2 just sitting lmao
Smart move, dude. I think everyone is over these 200k builds. Ive been a euro guy since 2000 and i still think fondly about my old mk3, volvo Brick, and 96 saab turbo. Sure, they stranded me, tried offing me on multiple occasions, but man, for the price, can't be beat.
stop telling people about 07ks before we can’t afford them😂
What happened to donut
Volvo platform is the same way for 92-2012 whiteblock based cars, similar options just no diesel but pretty sure the earlier 90's volvos like the 850 came with a audi inline 5 diesel engines across the pond
Must be solo cuz you don’t upload often.
I don't think Cleetus McFarland would approve of that turd.
all you need is a new motor, frame and body
Hey James. I have a Volkswagen, but it isn’t that old, and it isn’t a Golf. Can we still be friends and hang out and talk about little things about our cars?
Make it RWD or AWD and put a turbo LS engine in it.
Make the Scene-quel. 😎
of course this comes out when I've been looking for a GTI...
To each their own.
Helllllllll yeah, VW build!!
It would be a really great video going over how you can even get this car registered in CA, or any other emissions regulated state. If not, go over what your options are if you are not able to legally drive it on the road.
it is a good car but its extremely ugly
It’s nice to see another vdub enthusiast go through the pain of wanting to restore their gti. I’m going through some pain with my mk6
love the wallabees brother
Not even big on VW (more of a Mazda guy) an I'm STOKED for this build!  Also, congrats on the channel doing so well, digging the overall vibe. 😎👍👍
What about the scirocco
Okay but why didn't the dry erase come off with the tape.
Anyone remember Hot VWs mag?
i got a 2000 VW beetle for my wife (her Dream car) so i need some help with that as i have no idea what I'm doing.. any VW people that can help me with sites or ideas.
Subscribed to this one! Btw that’s my old “Man From Chile Gray” MK3 GTi at 5:37
Vurraahhhh
@speeedCo I acquired a 300zx import today. I intend to document everything this time too. Crazy.
W
Bought a mk6 and its my first ko4 tuned car and its been a blast
Had a 99 2.0 gti and an 08 2.0t back in the day. Missed them both so just went a picked up a mk7 with a little work already done to it. Very excited to be back in the VW scene and glad you are too now!
Vr6
The car was created in a 3D render. It's not remotely similar to yours... 0:15 the car belongs to jp Performance from Germany. Completely self-developed and built with an Audi R8 v10
My god, almost had me there. I actually started looking at old VW and seats online. Good thing I went outside and remembered there BMWs in this world 😅
I love old vws!💜💜  I have :  A 16v 2.0 5 speed mk2 golf  (Entirely stock but it has rally in its future) [dream car]  A 12v vr6 5 speed mk3 jetta Full early 2000s body kit job halfway done with gaudy crome lexani wheels. (I bought it just for the vr6 drive train... I think you've changed my mind)  A 24v vr6 6 speed mk4 golf that is a donor car for the mid engine honda civic build im currently full force into. (The mk4 was the first car i loved, but a high school kid crashed into it destroyed the front end, and the block so now I'm rebuilding the engine and making the drive train live on, in the back of a ef Honda civic hatch.) 😂😂  As I stated above you have inspired me not to take the 12v vr6 out of my mk3 jetta and swap it into something else. I am going to finish the early 2000s style wide body keep the lexani wheels and do it up right just to do my part to keep that style alive! 💜
Find you a Husco arm rest
WE ARE BACK BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want a ws6 tho
I miss my VW Corrado
I'm actually so hype for this. I live in Wolfsburg so this car came quite literally from close to my heart lol
Im 40 and remember going to every h2o and waterfest since I lived a hr away went on family vacation to ocmd during h2o like 4 years ago and boom got fucking impounded for to low when I was with my family want the vw scean to be the way it was
not name dropping H20.... H20 OCMD <3
Damn. You just described my intro to car culture in the early 2000s.
You and big time should do one of those early YouTube network things.
I’m that cousin with the dead look in his eyes.
11:17 @mediumbuild hat enters the chat
I have 2 Golf 4's😀 One is my daily, the other one stay in the garage. Both are GTI 1.8T 20V 132KW. (Silver)
YOOO, i completly forgot that this Car existed, i have picture of it in Wolfsburg at the GTI Coming Home in 2018, i was there with my first MK5 GTI Edition 30 😄
Nah, you said build back better was good, you're just as bad as donut is
I have a mk6 gti. I love it so much, I’m in college right now but once I graduate and get a big boy job I’m pimping it out
this is my favorite video I've ever seen
Sitting here with my mk5 jetta with a 2.5 and a 5 speed with 150k....   I keep saying I want to do something with it. Didn't know the 2.5 was such a potential powerhouse
I don't need convincing. I already have a mk3 VR6 project car and it is broken as well! 😅
Vortex is still alive, just not as strong as the late 90s
All that V2 money from the nazis
For me personally ..its golf Mk4.. Nest looking car ever..i had diesel and petrol..both were great..no rust after 20years..no big issues ..sit and drive
I think that Dacia logan from 2004 is underated zoo, i have it and its a reliable and good car
does castro fix hondas, ik he does but how much for a pedestrian who ain’t famous 🤣
Honestly it seems like donut had him and the other channel make their own channel and say they left donut to help donut grow. Idk just a thought of mine
James didn't you learn about letting towtrucks strap your vehicle down by the wheels when one of the Z's got into an accident on the way to the track?
Who are you?  Why should we care about a golf?
Alfa 147! ww sux
Medium build hat. I don't know a ton about cars but would love to talk music with him.
I disagree, the golf is actuall a jetta with a DUMPY
Love this cars and the whole 2000s scene, my first car was my dads 96 passat caravan :D
A few years ago I bought a 1993 mk3 gti. It was one of the earliest mk3’s in the uk at the time. It needed a lot of work but it came with most of the bits needed and I paid £80 for it with the parts (about $100) and then went about getting it back on the road. I put another £450 into fixing it up. I got it through an MOT (annual road safety test) and drove it around for a few years. It was honestly a really fun car. Not quick as it was only a 2.0 8v but it was fun. I then got a 2000 mk4 gti 1.8t and got it tuned to around 180bhp which was a lot of fun and because the mk4 gti was very subtle with its styling it surprised a lot of people as it could easily pass for a 1.4 Then last year I bought a 2007 mk5 gti and tuned it to just shy of 300bhp and got the DSG tuned up to match. It was wicked fun. On all of those cars I spent way less than £5k (on each car, not collectively) and they were by far some of the most fun cars I’ve ever owned and pretty reliable too
Who's the bald red guy?
I hate rust. I have an old 60s car- and rust freaking kills these older cars.  Also- that sketchy cafe pic was great
Looking real fresh big bro, keep it up!
Vw all day bby
BIG TIME AND SPEED COLLAB LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cars being named after the 'Car' magazine cracked me up LOL
or a cabrio!! dont forget the 'vert love. Golf/Jetta/Cabrio always MK3!!
I just bought an 06 GTI. Never felt this way about a car... Dont think I will ever buy anything but a Gofl ever again.
I miss my mk3 VR6. I look on the classifieds for them occasionally and im sad to see the sad state of things. Lots of rust and rotted interiors. Hard to find a decent starter build.
Heck yeah!
Even if you do get it documented #47 might still make you ship it back to its origin country.
This is my new favorite channel! I knew of this dude from the one Donut video I watched years ago, but never started watching them. This channel got recommended to me on the carhartt video and I’ve gotta say, this guy is so genuinely likeable, true professional, and generally a cool dude. Respect
I wish I could keep my '04 Polo, but I have to trade it in to get a '22 i30. Unfortunately I don't have the money to keep the Polo and work on it.
My mkiv has been in the barn for about 7 years now 😂
James, if you're going deep on the european import cars, i'd say a comparison between the h2o vw scene, the european scenes like the max power style would be an interesting time capsule
Cool Bro! Your baby is salvageable. Congrats.
So glad I got my mk3 glx Jetta before the prices jumped
Volkswagen fans are the most eclectic eccentric car scene around, not only the cars the enthusiast are top notch some of the most interesting people you could hope to meet.
Sounds like the VW going to get MORE POWRA BABY!!
Miss my Mk5 Rabbit. The 07k is a great engine
What happened to your voice at the end? xD
VWs are POS and a waste of money!
I don't care what anyone says...a VW will never be as cool as a Honda or some old school muscle car! Where this hype for VW comes from??
This gone be lit
I hope you did the horn honking in one take. Lol.
Can you use this build as an excuse to get Vin to feature some MkIV content plz?
Donut media doesn’t come up in my YouTube feed anymore, do you not work there anymore?
Mk4 R32 supremacy
He says old Volkswagen I think air cooled to me water cooled vw a new
Welcome home Volkswagen
taking back sunday!
I might have a Jetta but owning a VW is a beautiful feeling.
Biggest issue with the Golf? Wrong wheel drive.
please do a video on the grandfather of the golf/rabbit. its called the VW type 3 and i think you would love it
In the balkans where im from, VW has a cult status. Espcially the Golf .. grandad had a Mk2 assembled in Sarajevo. Still remember that new car smell. Police drove Mk3 and Mk4, marked and unmarked. you could tell cops about to stop you in the street just by hearing that diesel creeping behind you. To this day its highly prized and keeps the best price on the 2nd hand market
This Volkswagen is one of the best comebacks in anime history
James you need to come out to an event here in south florida called "eurotripper" the vw scene out here is alive n well
James just came to give u ur like but vw’s i can give 2 fucks thank youuuu
@HumbleMechanic hell yeah!!
No, Golf suks a lot!
I own a 1970 Chevy Chevelle and I'm very much big on muscle cars, but zero lies - I want a Mk. IV of some sort real bad.  I love hatchbacks.
I got a mk1 golf shes rough as fuck  but we working on it lol
This is the kick in the pants to motivate me to work on my Mk6 GTI....Let's go!
Chapel from VWV checking in. Member since 1998 (pre-crash I)
this is so cool man, I live near the VW Factory in Wolfsburg.. I might have seen your car there at some point 😂
Speeed is great but I think we are all missing some Upp too Speeed energy. I know that I'm in the backseat, but that man is missed. Ford *lightning* lightning 🌩
20:49 I love it, got a good laugh out of me when the smoke was coming out everywhere but LET'S GO!
i literally 2 weeks ago bought a 2002 gti vr6 project car
Volkswagens will always have a special place in my heart. My dad is a super enthusiast and I have fond memories of going to shows like Waterfest and Three Bugs in a Barrel. I drive an '04 Golf tdi that by dad bought new. I remember late nights falling asleep in the back seats. Now it's my daily and I can't imagine ever parting with it.   One thing about the mk4 platform is that I feel like it still holds up to modern driving standards. They were well made and had great sight lines; things you can't say about all modern cars. A simple stereo upgrade can help modernize them quite a bit. Gen 4 is def a turning point for me from old school to new school.
This is the motivation I needed to work on my 350z! Thanks!
My family has been driving jetta's and rabbit's/golfs with those 2.5 liter engines since I was in middle school.  Those things are some of those most reliable cars we have ever had, only beaten by my dads old 90's camry, also I think the 2.0 liters are a little overlooked as well. Had a jetta with one that I got at about 120k miles and I took it about another 100k more with pretty normal maintenance.  I know a lot of people don't like VW's because of the "European reliability" issue but I think that's down to people always wanting to put on or get them with turbos. every VW I've ever encountered with my family or driven myself that had a bunch of problems with the engine was always either a factory turbo or one me and my brother added.
Love you Jimmy
the vw golf scene in South Africa is this HUGE bro,  specially the mk1's you should come you will be amazed.
This is the content I wanna see! 🤘
If Jetta is a golf with a butt then what is the Passat? Golf with a badonadonk?
Dude you made me become a mechanic
Your on it bud....ive only owned jettas since the early 00's when I got my first job...a year before I was legally able to drive
Your love for VW’s is what got me to follow you, I have a mostly stock Mk4 GTI 1.8t and it’s my baby, so if the prices go up she gets more value! Looking forward to seeing you get your golf up and ready, btw I created those same list for mine when I blew the turbo on mine lol!
Mannn Mk3's are something else, my love for Mk3's started off by the youth culture back in the days of The Netherlands, and my Polish grandfather had a Mk3 Tdi (with gti bottle cap wheels!). He loved that car a lot because it never broke down, only needed some rust treatment like every Mk3😂. I've bought a Mk3 Cabrio for.500 euro's 6 years go, and that's when the addiction really started. Now I'm on my 4th mk3 Cabrio (USA spec🥰) and several other Golf's. Volkswagens are like a STD, you can't get rid off it.
James brotha why tf did you lose weight?!? Also nice golf 🤣🤣
it doesn’t scare you.  it’s pretty much the best thing you could hear at the shop in that condition 10/10 motivation on working on it and working on our rusty pile here 🥂
great background music
Yay! Back to projects.
Calling JPs Golf 3 a replica is a big stretch.
James on his own gets more views and likes than current day Donut. Just proof once again that investors should stay investors and let the creators/artists do their thing.
Dude im not into vw and i love watching your videos. Its the passion that hooks me and makes me watch. I even watched the whole nord vpn add cuz i kept laughing at your jokes. A grade content. I hope you get to make it forever. You are the next Jeremy Clarkson, and i can say that with confidence.
Rust free cali car ❌ Rusty pos from Germany ✅
Glad to see you show up in my feed.  You and Zach was why I watched donut.
I've owned countless Dubs.  We probably crossed paths on VWVortex many times. Taking on this project hit me in the feels.  Love it.
Hell yeah got my 97 golf rally sport 🎉
Ive had VAG stuff since I learned to drive, golfs, Jettas, Boras, Passats, A4, A6, A3 etc  My 63 yr old dad retired 5 years ago and for something to do in his returement, we built his 1.9tdi 100hp golf wagon into a 1.8T swapped, 482 whp monstrosity that is a laugh a minute. Volkswagens are infuriating, but the best at the same time ❤
I didn't know I needed a series of videos about the overhaul of this mk3 but MAN was I wrong.
i mean i got a MK4 Jetta im rebuilding
Wait Jp don‘t Replicate your car
Lollll I freaking love #5
golfs just went up 5g's
Happy owner of a Mk7.5 GTI. It mighty not be THE perfect car, but its in the running! Youll be amazed how many boxes these little cars will mark off once you're driving one.
That shop kinda reminds me of Emilia's old one
Didn’t adolf hitler help create the machine 😂
So, what years are the most reliable vw golf to buy in 2025 to used everyday
I had a 1990 VW corrado g60 with the supercharger and it was ment. Low miles, manual, bright red with that karmen interior.  I wish i never sold that car. Would be awesome to have today.
James is the V2 Scotto haha. this is dope
Channel is really hitting its stride. Personal, attainable, passionate. So glad to see James this happy
youre from kentucky?
Glad to see you got your car back man! Im actually going to be calling up a good local shop to finally get my pile of crap integra that ive put far too much money into a smoke test, if we figure out the problem there, its the first step to rebuilding this car, i totally get the sentimental value, this thing has made me want to rip my hair out multiple times but i stil stuck with it, its about seeing the potential when no one does too. Cant wait to see where your mk3 goes. (I thought about getting a convertible mk2 before i got my miata, i almost got obsessed with vws like you did 😂, the miata is still doing great too, lovely little car.) Nice seeing you again James you look alot happier doing you own thing ❤❤❤
So "you might as well" is the girl math of cars. Got it.
i got the same gold, gonna get my license in February hopefully
I'd love to see James have an absolute existential crisis, looking at the Maxx power car scene that once was.
"and I don't care what some bald red guy on the internet told you. it does matter what girls like."   < QUOTE OF THE YEAR
15:05 the fact he got USA and Australia correct, but not Spain and Guatemala.
This channel will fail
He back!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💯💯💯  Mo powahhhh!!!!!
Water and h20🥲 had a mk3 vr6 back in high school when the scene was at peak and those were some of the best memories(not breaking oil pans) what started the whole vw itch for me and will always have a special place in my heart
In Europe, Volkswagen owners are seen as obnoxious asocial selfish hooligans. They've got a saying around here "Make way for the Volkswagen". Maybe they're a bit more of a rarity on the streets in the US and thus the scene there is entirely different?
Damn, Castro can fix anything! Bro ain't scared of nothing xD
i wont buy one im a honda boy but i wanna see this car do things and stuff
Got me nostalgic about my Mk3 Jetta.  My first project car here in the US.  The Jetta GT and I gone through a lot until a tree fell on it during a windstorm.  Sadly had to get rid of it.  Watching this video, it got me looking at Mk3 Jettas to purchase in the future as I still held onto some parts.  Such as a 16v head I was going to swap onto the 2.slow block, a VR6 head when I for second thought about swapping in the VR6 after cleaning up the VR6 block, a Mk2 Jetta spoiler that I planned to fit onto.  It was such an easy car to work on and quite honestly...despite it only being around 115hp...I had a lot of fun driving it.  It was gonna be my stance project at the time.  But now...I just missed driving a 90's VW.
Thank you🙏
Fun thing is i just came home from a friend who had bought a Golf GTI  and tuned it :P
Bro really said that JP Performance "replicated" his Golf 3.
Around where I live, it's the most blown up engine you can get for your $10,000.
Yoooo!  Thanks for giving credit to that horrible ass waterfest video I shot so long ago!   Big fan! Keep it up!
My first VW Meet experience was through SoWo I'm Helen GA ❤
I’m happy that tdi wasn’t barely mentioned. 😂
Good work jimbo
Just gonna put this out there, volvo c30. Factory turbo 5cyl, 6spd manual available, even the autos are fun, looks killer, and You can find a good condition auto for $3-4k
Where i started liking golf's was from jesse in fast and furious wish they did not kill him off so soon I loved the character
Mk4 gti here, 286k miles
My first car was a mk4 gti. I still drive it to this day after a decade of owning it.
You should come out to the loe show in September .
oh shit, you used my boy's Waterfest 2002 videos of the hooning :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3RaqpS8TPU
I like James but all the stuff he said was started with vws was around before hand. Its just car mods.
<3 a🪲 🤘 👍👍
James is the goat of 90's car scene content
Good luck finding an A3 that's not rotten for a good price though. They got tinworm worse than a lot of A1s and A2s.
I had a vwvortex account... maybe i still do? Back in 04 when i bought my 99.5 vr6. Absolutely loved that car and wish i still had it.
never buying vw
You need to make a cameo in big time
A dieselgate cayenne is a beast that gets like 40+ mpg if you tamper with them
That is one ugly looking car
Like every VW owner, ya got loose screws in ya heads just like the cars ya own. Ain’t no way a pre mk4 vw is project car. More like a classic money pit.
I have a 2008 Volkswagen B7 Passat 6Speed  timing belt burst rebuild the engine + messed up after 8 months. Where is the best place in United States where I can buy a used CCTA Volkswagen engine? If I can't get it for a good price then definitely going to have to sell. It's been sitting for 4 years
Please finish this build 🙏🏾 I probably gonna getta jetta for the family ❤this video
Bro this channel is legit so awesome.
I started going to H2Oi right before the shit shows really started, but then again I was there at the tail end of all of it. I went four times and the last time I went, the riot squad came out right after I left. It was always a fun event, but when the shenanigans started, it was time to go back to the room or go home. Then the cops started giving out as many tickets as they possibly could and impounding cars, you couldn’t get your car released from the impound unless you had it towed out of state so once all that really started happening, it was time to quit the event I think the following year, after my last event was the last one
I know the "German Invasion" in Shelby, NC is a big VW event every year. They also partner with charities if I remember correctly. I was invited to attend, but I drive old Saab C900s, so I would probably be out of place a little. 😂
This looks like a BIG TIME job
'Community' is a magnificent TV show, James - but what does it have to do with Golfs?
"the magazine THAT CARS WeRE naMEd aFTeR" fucking melted my brain and made me crack up way more than what was appropriate lmfao
I got a Volkswagen golf mk3 1993 1.8lt carb got 300 000km on the clock now still going strong
H2o was always a blast
Hell yeah! I got a mk1 golf that's my current project, and just like you, i want to 5 cylinder swap it.
0:13 REPLICATED? HELL NO! The car isnt a car. Its just a Audi V10 with a cage an som golf 3 body panels made by german tuner JP Performance and is called the "G3"
With the rust, if you love the shell - spend the money to make it right. You’ll never have the history you have with this one, with a new one.
8:36 *Commuinity* 😂
Some great reasons to own a vw in my opinion ahaha I have a vw polo t.d.i and I completely love it, they look great and are quite agile
They're cheap cause they're junk lol I had a mk5 gli Jetta. I loved the car and babied it, it was so unreliable. After it hit 100k miles it was costing me 8k a year in maintenance
Everything you said can be applied to the Miata
Got a Mk5 2.0 GT TDI last year and absolutely love it - been falling deeper into the world of Golf ever since. Glad the prices are about to skyrocket :)
holy moly is that a dakar e30
After a buuuunch of air and water-cooled VWs, my first brand new VW was a 1995 VW Golf Sport. Currently in a 2016 GTI Autobahn. They are the Swiss Army knife of automobiles.
Bro are we best friends? Medium build fan? Mk3 GTI nerd?
WE NEED A VIDEO JUST ABOUT VW ENGINE COVER THE INES U TALKED ABOUT IN THIS VIDEO BUT DEEPER IN DEPTH,I think a lot of us would enjoy 🎉
I think JP's G3 project ist not a rep of your golf
He should come to the vdub fest in South Africa
This is the way, James!
Very cool. I have always loved these and any offbeat sort of car. I can relate to the regional thing. I am in Louisville, KY and it's always been "MUSS'Tang, 'Maro, and TRY-FI" Country (rolls eyes so hard, head hurts). Where did you grow up in Kentucky, and what inspired you to move to LA?
VWAG 5CYL REPRESENT😭💪🏼 I LOVE my 2.5L!! It has never left me stranded and it taught me everything I know about working on cars alone! (That doesn’t stop me from driving around with a WHOLE MECHANIC SHOP in the trunk of my MK6 Jetta)💀
i want see your g-wagon
Better than a 90s Honda Civic Si?? Im afraid not sir.😂😂😂 Bot my uncle worked for a place called "Import Auro Salvage" during the 90s-00s tuner era, post F&F. One of them tore down cars and one was shipping manager. They both said VW parts out sold all other tuner parts by far. Power window switchs made that company so many dollars.
3:47 I KNOW THAT TRUCK!!!!
Very nice Video i right now have a mk2 very sick golf
That's sick man, GGS VW for life
A mate and I imported a MK3 from Japan in that blue/purple flip knobs zero about VWs. Why? Cos we'd seen heaps of hot girls driving them and figured we'd tidy it up and have a wave of hot girls coming out way to check out the car.
In my country vw golf and passat community is the worst. Because of that I started to hate especially golf mk 2  and all passats. But I love mk 1 golf.
Volkswagen can really use the hype right now, thanks for the great content! ❤
Going too be fun watching this baby back too life
Missed watching James
my first love a GTI 95 Black imported from Mexico
My first car was a mk4 golf and i loved it. Wish i still had it. Can't wait for this series.
Thank God the golf is saved! Or will be at least!
Loved slammed vws..don’t like some of the designs that the oil pan sat so low tho 😢
I am a medley, a fan of old Fiats and Alfa Romeo from the late 70s early 80s. More recently I’ve gotten into Volvo’s, and have plans to possibly build a lifted C3 all-wheel-drive rally car. However, if I were to choose one other car to do instead of that, it would be the MK3 golf. The amount of work it’s gonna take to make an AWD C30 and lift the suspension is absolutely nuts. Meanwhile, I could pretty much do a MK3 with off the shelf parts.  I am super stoked to see how this project works out.
Nice medium build hat! Love them
Surprisingly never caught fire either
I know a guy in Colorado Springs running a old VW rabbit with a big big turbo . He is making almost 1000 hp, insane speed 😂😂
Day 6,450 of asking him to do an up to speed on his dad
Golfs in the UK are literally 10 a penny, we have something like 4 million of them on the roads, so spending all that time and money on a project car for it to look like every other car just isn't worth it here.
As long as the frame is good the rest can be remade. And its a real german those are great to work on :D.
Very cool!
love a sentimental build man. This is gonna be awesome. Im on the subie train but someday maybe ill grab a Jetta GLI idk why but i like em
Man! I certainly missed the way James writes and creates the narrative of his videos, this is what I started watching donut for in the first place. Love this channel.
Oh man.. H2oi. I'll never forget making the 13 hr drive down to Maryland from Toronto with my buddies during covid. What a blast. It's too bad people have really taken it over the top now. The little hooning and 5 day car show was epic back in the day. One of my favourite car enthusiast memories for a long time to come. I wish I could make it down to the Southern states to live out my car guy dreams.. Sucks being stuck in Canada with that piece of shyt turdeau
Glad you got it back. Still sad Donut fell apart and became a greedy channel only caring about views/quantity of uploads over quality videos. But I am happy everyone took a stand and left.
Awesome video, I'm on my 3rd golf now... Need to get you out to Wookies in the woods!
As much do I love to buy an old golf/jetta (since Im never be able to get a hand of lancia cars), the price in Malaysia is Craaaaaaazy Expensive and the transmission itself are not suitable for our climate (hot and wet all year)..But thank you for keep pushing on car projects even after leaving Donuts.  Ohh well, at least our old national cars are still affordable for a fun car project, hopefully..🤣🤣
James from Donut was cool but the real James is so much cooler
Mans really gave up the 2.5l secrets
Golfs in general are unreliable as fuck, there a reson barely anyone buys em new or used where i live
Fun video! I’m a RWD guy, so I’m going to enjoy from the side lines! Love you!
You look super healthy James!  It's great to see you thriving man.
I have owned a Mk3, Mk4, Mk6 Golfs and a MK6 wagon!  Still have the MK6 2.5L Golf as my daily driver. Hoping to get a early 90s Carbio someday!
Did donut gave you problems for getting back the car?
GO TO 18:20 TO SKIP THE SPONSORED ADS AND ORHER BS
The community is the best, my first car was a 500$ beat up mk3 jetta which turned into 2 sciroccos a bagged mk5 jetta, mk5 rabbit and mk4 jetta. Ill never forget the days of h20i,  wolfsgart, waterfest and all the other smaller get togethers. Was a great time. I feel like the scene is getting ruined by collectors though because its not as easy to get in on a low budget.  My next vw will be a caddy if i can ever find one that fits the bill.
Donut x Speeed collab
I see A LOT of 07K content and I love it. Looking forward to the next video.
This man’s word smithing is second to none!
vw golf/jetta prices abouta go up
i daily a golf project allready, ill be fine
If you remember Waterfest when it was at SUNY Purchase, and H2O when it was in a commuter lot in Westchester county....then at Lime Rock, then you are going back.
I remember sorting the rear bumper for you. Enjoy it bud.
Love the content 💯💪🏽
I’m so excited about this series
Obi wan canoli.... gotta change the colour
I've always wanted a golf. Ever since I was a kid, and watched videos of the diesel golfs doing pulls before the emissions got to them.
H2Oi 😢
Love the TBS reference!
The Mk3 Golf reminds me of Max Power in the UK
With the clarks on!!!! You technically have pop up head lights on.
I have a 2002 1.8T Quattro Audi A4.  It's a wonderful older car that still looks and runs very well. Would love to tune it up and add more but not sure if I will ever get there. If anyone is an Audi enthusiast and interested in possibly buying it, let me know.   It is in amazing condition and runs very well. I've maintained it over the years with very low KM's
Love a mk3. I’ve owned probably 6 of em and they are one of my favs
I think the theory of you talking about cars making them more expensive is correct. After your Land Cruiser video on Donut, they skyrocketed like a year later. I just bought an 80 series last month and learned about them from that video. Already my favorite vehicle I’ve ever owned.
I feel like we're walking down memory lane in the first 2 minutes.
How you gonna put this out right after I bought a project Saab? We can still hang out though right?
Been waiting to see this car back on a video. As a big VAG fan and owner this video feels very relatable. Don't own a golf anymore but a fancy Spanish equivalent (leon cupra), basically a mk7 gti with an R engine and lsd from factory
Car comes from the latin for wheeled vehicle (carrus)....
My MK5 Jetta more resembles a longer version of your Golf and has no butt...  My first exposure to any post 60s VW was an 80s Rabbit that deserved to die with prejudice from its start.  I got mine out of necessity and was surprised (Pros) by the sheer number of screws holding everything together compared to is American and Japanese counterparts and the computer situation.  On the con side,  the sheer amount of plastic and fragile nature of many of its parts is highly disappointing. Pair this with the frequent "European" upcharge to get it worked on and it's a rather unique platform...  All in all...  If you are willing to do the grunt work they can hold promise and are inexpensive.  Mine at least seems more durable than the Subarus donut bought.   I would be hesitant to buy one knowing what I know now if I had to pay a mechanic for every repair though.  I truly wish it had one more gear at highway speed though.
Bro, putting in JP‘s mid engined w12 golf as „replicated“ 😂
damn this is making me miss my mk4
It brings me so much joy seeing James happy and healthy, doing what he loves. You frickn rock man!
I want a mk5 gti Fahrenheit edition
Why does the USA not have BMW 1 series. The 140i F20 with the B58 ist an insane car, would be interesting to see some american Projects.
I had a mk3 vr6 2dr. Out of 40 cars I've owned now, that's definitely top 5. Prolly 4
Vw hasnt made a decent vehicle since the vw bug . As a technician of 20 + years i can confidently say that . Go to any shop and just mention german engineering and try not to be offended by the honest responses that you will receive ! Cheap to build and unreliably  expensive to maintain !
living in elizabethtown KY i feel that pain. the import scene is getting better tho
Mk6 gti owner here. I lost my passion for cars due to being bored with my first one. And due to reliability issues (2011 Hyundai), I managed to switch into a 2011 GTI Autobahn. Ever since I decided to fix it myself due to how outrageous to get anything done on this car.  It's a wonderful platform despite all the negative press it got. If you fix any issues, download good tunes and not sketchy ones, make sure you have revisions or mods that are just better (aluminum water pump)   It's worth it. And your spirit only helped fueled mine. Hopefully we can meet one day!
So is this now more of a car channel? I didn't subscribe initially because this brand stuff isn't for me yet there have been multiple car videos suggested to me and this video for instance I really enjoy
I'm not even a car person but I was so invested and am so happy you got a good diagnosis.
ok hear me out: golf mk4 4motion rally build
...I need to buy another mk2 Golf
This core is ok! As they keep running it circulating metal in the oil. That’s getting in the cam journals and other soft bits that can only be replaced.
You really think JP Performance replicated your car?
I always like the list and numbers format! Easy to relate and remember..
Dude your videos are getting better and better :) I'm super happy :D
Car guys aren't car guys because it's what makes sense.
My mum and dad both had mk3s while I was growing up, my dad's was a vr6 and sounded awesome to 5 year old me. 2 of my uncles had mk2s, and one of them was vr6 swapped as well. Great video
please reconsider.. i still need parts for my golf to be cheap or i will go bankrupt 🥹
hey you dont have to convince me to get a golf project, i got one exept mine is mk4 xD
Best thing about the Mk3, they're classless. I don't mean that in a bad way. You could purchase an R32 and having it sat outside an upper middle class household, or you can buy a TDi and have it parked outside a working class home. They're stunning, timeless and have a fit for everyone. Best looking Golf hands down. Modern Golfs look like shite in comparison.
Stance garbage doesn't belong on a mustang 🤣
Pumped about this build! I just got back into a mk2 golf with a butt myself.  Feels like I’m back home! Miss those vortex days 😢. Is your mk3 going to make it to  Roots Classic one day?
Love my mk3 vr6, would recommend anyone to get it as a first project
I got an mk4 tdi. Love it and it's currently getting personalized
Pd130 or nothing ;), iv a skoda so close enough
Does an Audi A3 2003 count and still let me hang out... :(
You riding my dream car
My silver mk3 Wolfsburg got me through college like a champ. Some if the doors didn't work and it had an exhaust leak in the cabin but it was a complete trooper. Sadly I blew a brake line the second day into my new job out of college and had to trade it in for a new car. I miss it.
I was WONDERING where this was!! WE ARE SO BACK!
Before I got smart and went all the way into EVs I almost always had a Golf GTI, probably 10 of them through the years.
Golfs are about to blow up
Love when you find out when someone else is a Dub head LOL
Thanks for bringing back memories of my MkIII and Vortex Pumph!
Great video, Not a VW or VAG group fan (Had a 2000 Audi TT all wheel drive, MY GOD Amazing pull and grip) but always on the PC finding faults. But cars should be about inclusion not exclusion.
I don't have a Golf but I have a TT is that good enough so I don't have to go down the VAG road again
8:37 had a mistake dom doesnt have friend he has family
Golf prices 😭😭😭
I love the MK6, have had 4 of them, including an R and three GTI. I think they look so much better than the current generation
I'm really excited about this project. I've always felt a connection with you because of the Mk3. My first car was an Mk3 also. Unfortunately, the fan base for these cars is decreasing here in Hungary too. I know most of my friends because of the Mk3 or the Volkswagens.
So the car is pretty well f-ed. Perfect.   For those of us at a certain age, it can be steve austin. You can rebuild it. Better, stronger, faster.
resumed: you´re getting old
It'll be sweet to see that thing road worthy, even sweeter in the magazine 😎
Just got my third GTI. Glad it was a few days before this dropped and the prices increased
Rwd 2j conversion 👀
@7:04 Saab.
dude its litaly only a vw golf
I love the solo content, way more real energy, the donut clips with the hyped energy were good to get you going, but stick w this, keep it real
James lets chat man. I would love to make this audio sound better for you.
I just have to say it pop up and down headlights 😅
7:44 DVX Performance Belgium represeeeeent
That car isnt worth restoring
This is exactly the type of content this Chanel was missing, definitely need more of this. 👌
I'm not a really a gulf guy, (I worked on a few and almost got one) but I appreciate the passion and I'm ready to this bad boy pump out some buff horses.
Pull the engine out of the car and strip it down and send the block off to the machine shop and have it machined. Unless you are planning on changing the head on the engine, send the current head over and have it ported and polished as well. As long as there is not a giant hole in the side of the block, you are fine. Good luck and I am looking forward to seeing y'all put this car back together!!
VeeDubs are the cat's pajamas. I'm more of a air-cooled guy, but do like me some GTI.
No it's not. It's still Toyota Chaser(/mark 2/cresta) if you can find one 🤦
OMG MK3 CONTENT MK3 CONTENT MK3 CONTENT!!!! I have a 98 Ginster GTI <3
Oletko. Vähän  Vaajakosken   Olet. Pilannut  folrin
VW Turbo Diesels for life.
Ahh Yesh Vwvortex.. when me and my autistic mind spammed the fuck out of therare parts section.  with everything from europe . not seen before... good times in 1999 thru 2000  god im that old again....
Looooooove this car
I bought a Mk4 Golf 1.4 two years ago and if you show it love and care for it, it'll probably show affection by drinking oil like gas :)
Glad to be a part of the Commuinity
15:55 lol you are hilarious bro
Besides the intro video you originally posted “why you left donut” this is my new favorite video and style of you , reminds me of the James at donut in a new light 💡
@ramairfilters 😶
@brett.mk2 ! Lets go!
Dammit James, ive been looking for a sweet GTI. Thanks for increasing the prices haha
does a mk7 work?
Loved the Video - I so hope you keep the colour ! its beautiful
Man, missing my '97 Golf Diesel right now.
If you care what girls like, you’re a lost simp. Simple as.
0:35 always has been
still bummed i could never help you out with this car. . glad to see you doing what ur at being at the core  wish you all the best james!
is this not donut?? something seems off about him , even the way he speaks
Get a VR6 engine for your Golf project :)
Harcode VW nerd here at 8:25 it is a MK2 Golf not a MK1. Kinda the same just a bit fatter haha
I agree with you. I used to work as collision tech for VAG cars, not a huge fan. But even I watch regularly to well, of course this, Humblemechanic AND Paul at Deutsche Auto Parts. 🤘🏻
Starting a Golf Club …I’ll see myself out 😂
"Might as well" is the reason I got a rear disc brake kit and heavy duty halfshaft for my jimny... All because I had to change a wheel bearing. Truly a slippery slope
Bro, the vibe you give is solid. Just a man, his friends, and a garage. Doesnt feel corporate, feels genuine.   Love the content!
finally a real car video from you james..hurrraaahh
The VW scene in South Africa is alive and well. You'll find the most unique VW builds in SA.
Was ignoring this video at first cuz i thought it was Big time
Nah fam you can't convince me to buy a German car 💀
Sorry bud but just on rust alone the car is a piece of 💩 you should’ve never started that chassis to begin with
As soon as you said that this video will make me want to buy one I almost didn't watch it 😅 because as a car guy I have a serious problem!
I’m from EU and it’s kinda fun to see you guys enjoy cars that we take for granted, vw especially golf and Passat  are so popular here that we don’t pay attention to them Everyone I know had a golf or a car that share platform with golf like Skoda Octavia/fabia, Seat Leon or Audi A3 etc Here guys are stocked about cars that are probably lame in usa, pickups and mustangs are something exotic and interesting lol
The Golf III from Jean Pierre Krämer alias JP Performance is definitely NOT a copy of your car. It is a prototype made of a tubular space frame and a V10 engine from an Audi R8. You can't build something like that and especially not you. Like every American, you just buy something and then claim some bullshit that it copied your car. Leave the Germans alone with the German cars and make sure you get enough spectators so that you don't end up sitting on the street like the rest.   Saying something like that can sometimes break your neck in the YouTube world. Buthead
that 2.5 vw engine is getting famous like the K24 from the hondas swap the world !
Im from switzerland and vw is the most hatet car in our carsceene. You literly can get one für 400.-
Just VRT it
who doesnt love the shitbox.
Glad you got your legend back 😄
Golf 3 1994 1.6 was my first car, and it was a awesome!
VR6 swap
Hurry up where’s the next video
I love my golf, so in.
I'm 48 seconds into the video, and I just can't believe that any German engineered vehicle is the best bang for the buck, but I'll give you a chance here...
Do a video feat bug time 🙌🎉 like a donut Réunion buy whitout Nolan 😂
Fellow mk3 vrt owner for 15 years  this is so good to hear ! Looking forward to this 💪
MAKE A SCENE would be  cool shirt
One thing to note the 3.6 vr6 used to run for 500 - 700 for a good one now that they discontinued the vr6 platform the prices on those engine has skyrocketed to 3k
Nothing is going to convince me to buy a VW. EVER. ill stick whit my Volvos. BUT this one is cool, you do you man! thats the most important part about any car community! you do what YOU want :D
Not gonna lie, I want to go get a golf now James, you may just drive up the price! 😂
Had my mk7 gti for 2 years now as my daily, apr whole intake and apr catless downpipe with an apr tune pushing 300 whp which is a ton of fun with the manual. Also it being a 4 door makes it super practical and the tech for a 10 year old car is great, great fender sound system with a backup camera. Overall solid fun daily that is pretty quick, in *Mexico* i can keep up with a g70 3.5t (at least till they tune it and as long as it's not off the line). The car handles road trips well and tight turns even better.
Alh tdi with an evrymod there awesome
Great episode
0:14 "replicaded" :D
God I miss peak H2Oi years. We getting old fam😅
1 mil views within 24hrs, man, James, you can see that you are a icon in the automotive world for alot of us. WE APPRECIATE YOU and love your content. Keep it going and keep us Entetained. (i know the chances are low that you see this but ive followed you forever, and even though you parted ways with your former employment, i am here to support).
Isn’t a 90’s civic a better bang for your buck project car? It will probably last longer too.
I want a MK4 Jetta with a W8 swap
Me watching the video and looking for jettas
yes while your in there might as well
I need a guy like Chris in NY. 😢😢 I have a 2016 Smart Fortwo 453 with turbo and it’s so hard to find someone that knows how to work on the car.
Hell yeah James. Build it.
In Sweden there is a yearly meet named bugg-run
lessgo!
I am a full JDM nerd and only bought japanese cars in my life but always had a soft spot for VW's, all of the, they are always such a vibe. The peoples car right?
I can’t agree more! I had 98 Jetta Wolfsburg 1.8t swapped, 98 Jetta 24v vrt and 97 Cabrio. Been to waterfest and H20. No longer a dubber but god I miss them. Love the video brother. Keep it up.
The WV Community in South Africa 🇿🇦 is crazy this is why your friend is here in South Africa right now doing a mk1 road trip highly recommend checking it out. In South Africa we host something called VW camp fest a lot of sick vw's🔥🔥🔥
Hell yes! Been waiting to see this thing come back to life! Loved seeing it at the first loe show
I love the golf and I love you, but the best budget project car will always be Honda Civic - bar none!
I got an 08 rabbit that I’m about to mod
Speeed, Overall, I like the Golf Mark II better. I'm from Europe and I'm currently saving money to buy one. They may not be expensive because they cost about 3,000 euros, but you will have to spend another 5,000 euros on it. But it really is a beautiful base for a classic. It would be best to get the Golf 2 with the addition of Syncro, which adds 4x4 drive to it. Later engine from Golf 5 2.8 VR6
you need a german friend that drives a Passat (and a Benz 190)? 😅
say thank's to "german tutning" if Vw scene brought all that in the USA
Love it. I got a 1995 Mk3 CL and a 1997 Mk3 1.8t AGU swap.  Greetings from Germany
Car is better than the sport !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Medium Build hat 🤌
I’m stoked for this, I still daily my 05 GTI that I bought brand new. Unfortunately I had to sell my 88’ mkii earlier this year, it was beyond my mechanical ability. But I love seeing these beautiful built mkii. Maybe one day I’ll have another. Looking forward to more VW love and content!!
Tf are these headlights 🤡  Hate from Germany, Wolfsburg for those 🫶
The GTI taxes such. My roots came from VW as well. Love me a clean MK4.
Theres just something about a mk4 jetta tdi. Ive had 3 of them already. And on my current one. Bigger turbo, bigger nozzles, tuned, straight pipe. One of the best cars. Fun, semi sporty, and i get 45 mpg
Blow by does not mean the ring lands are broken… could have broken rings and a damaged piston or two but, every engine has blow by. It’s the compression/combustion leaking past the rings. Usually from the ring gap or unseated/worn out rings. Just for anyone who thinks their “ring lands are broken” after watching this. Specially in diesels, a fair amount of blow by is completely normal.
Cool video james, glad to see you flourishing on your own
ughh hate that this video was just released that means i cant instantly go to the next episode
Bro really honked repeatedly while sitting in traffic just for an ad read
Yea no thanks 00 Jetta kept fucking 24/7 bang for buck if you own a local resteraunt
Man I never knew about the early 2000s vw scene as j was super young at the time, but over the past five or six years I’ve been buying and modding out vws, I can’t explain how tight knit and welcoming the community has been love my car too death and lover everybody who’s on vw crew
I cannot wait for this!!!
Man I miss the old forum days - Edition38 was awesome 😢  How do we get on the discord ? Downloaded the app but got stuck from there 🤦‍♂️
More power babyyyyyyy let's go! stoked for this build, had a MK3 golf myself, and we converted my buddies MK3 convertible from a 1.8 to a VR6 back in the good old days
Its not car if its that rusty and no longer attached XD
Hey James whats the engine code?  I'm exited to see that golf again! please upload as much of it as pissible❤ vw community middle east
It's so strange to me that america has this love for VW's. I mean I love them too but they're just traffic. Every meet you go to is packed with copy & paste golf mk3/4s & polo 9n/9n3/6n/6n2's. Like literally everywhere you go
you should have collab with western champlin i think u guys would get along well
holy shit, has it always been that rusty?
James im stoked you made this channel and got away from that other place. Their content is trash now and that idiot with the black hair they have working there now voice bothers me to my soul. If only you could collab with Nolan and not have to use that other logo.
You forgot the 16v and 8v n/a 2.0
This makes me really happy to see considering the first car ever bought from a dealer was a used Mark IV Golf.
You paid 7000 dollars for a fucking shitbox MK3? WHY. WE SCRAPPING THESE THINGS ALL DAY LONG, EVEN TODAY. THESE ARE FUCKING WORTHLESSM
ARE WE STARTING A GAGGLE OF GIGGLING GOLF GRIFTERS!?!?
why are golf 3 so expensive in the us here in germany they usually cost around 1k euro or 1k usD
I can't wait!
i was all about VWVortex Car Lounge back at that time. right around the millennium-ish i was going on there like all day every day. didn't even own a VW or even any VAG product then. i'd dip into the MKIV or B5 sections every once and awhile. but mostly alllll Car Lounge.
Reconnect with Zach and Jobe get a big time/speeed crossover rebuild the the car
Can't wait for next episode.
You could always Volvo 2.5T swap it lol
https://thetapestryofabraham.blogspot.com/
I grew up in a polo from the same generation, it was the 2 door version, with the classic green that vw had back then, this brings back so many memories, thank you.
You can tell he was excited because he said alot more horsepower instead of a hrspurrs or mopowah babeh. I'm so excited for this series, this car is going to be so damn cool
First car was a mk4 gti 1.8t agu, yet again another overlooked 4 banger that’s extremely strong out the box for a turbo 1.8
Sorry James I love ya but hot rods in the 70s and 80s had shaved engine bays, stretched tires, etc… this did not start in the 90s with the golf at all. I have Polaroid pics for the early eighties like 1980 of a car show we went to and most everything there had clean shaved engine bays, some sort of fender altercations if it was extended or shaved too, and wheel and tire combos that were extensive too.
the VW golf is an icon in South Africa, especially the Mk1. Search Speed N Sound and you will see. We have a saying here, there's always a mk1 faster.
James and '90s Volkswagen content. Name a better duo, I'll wait.
THIS GUY IS A CAR MARKET MANIPULATOR, THE NANCY PELOSSI OF THE CAR WORLD YOU COULD SAY, unbelievable behaviour 😆
Got a bone stock 95 Cabrio, love it haha
I wanna see this at Ultrace!
For at least 10 years I've complained that they don't put the 2.5tfsi in the Golf R. Golf's are generally the most reliable VW's, not sure how good the mk8s are but I know the older ones we only saw in the dealership very rarely for any warranty work. When I had my mk6 gti the only work I had to do was injectors, brakes, headlights and oil changes. I drove my gti across Canada and am still pissed I didn't make it to Newfoundland with it. I will always miss that car.  Actually wait, golf's are insanely unreliable, James is wrong, give me all your old golf's to dispose of, they're terrible, you shouldn't have to deal with them, give me your golf and go buy a civic or something, ya.
Welp looks like I'm finally gonna get my mk2 golf 1.8t swap finished, thank you James for this video. The VAG community needs more love
Lookout James horn is on the wheel rim. Thats a cool vw idea.
I have the American #69 Fahrenheit GTI. VW gang <3.
Mk 3 are cheap because it was  basically the beetle of the 90s. The basic 1.4 was everywhere then. Plus it had a rust problem if you were lucky enough to live somewhere where winter happens.
In eu you can even get the vr5 engine witch is a vr6 with 1less cylinder 10 and 20 valve. Thats the engine i an going for in my passat 32b (quantum syncro wagon)
I have still never owned a golf gti, i have had so many golfs but never managed to own a GTI, trying to convince my wife to swap her car for one now and she just wont. HELP!!!
I got a Brazilian Gol so let’s hang 😂
In Europe, this would be a junker, at least in the US, cars are still being given a new lease on life.
My dude needs to check out all the South African VW builds and events like Vdub Camp fest etc. We love them 💪🇿🇦🔥
Did you just say JP „replicated“ your car? Do you even know what he did to his G3? It’s like half the car anymore and there was supposed to be an R8 motor mid-mounted inside of it
Only idiots doesnt do rust potection coating when importing a car.. result is this.. super rusty junk.
I once owned a 2000 VW Polo, and I kinda get why they were so popular. The car made so much sense, too bad I was too poor to keep the nugget running
I think most people like the Golf, but they would rather have the Golf with the bigger butt.
As someone who used to rally a mk3 golf I absolutely adore the chassi. I had lots of trouble with the transmission though. It was a 02a motorsport prepared dogbox but the transmission housing is so weak it flexed under tension and we had to pull out the gearbox after 12 out of 13 rallies. Unfortunately the only allowed replacement from that point was sequential gearboxes which is too expensive for me so the golf had to go :(
I paid $200 for my Mk2 back in 2011. Sold it in 2015 and bought it back in 2021. Never selling it again!
Because Golfs are THE beginner car in Germany they are extremely cheap and plentiful but they are often pretty beat up. Just found a listing for a Mk3 Golf for 250€ with 106k miles but it only runs on 3 cylinders. Perfect project car material.
That yellow E30 though
Project cars are never finished dude
There is no way you get these views or subs. Way older and better channels don’t get this. You pay for your numbers. Weak
you NEED to get Jason "Adam Sandler" Cammisa to collab with you man, its gonna be So Cool
Glad to see she's saveable! My first car was a 1998 Volvo S70 and i miss that car a lot, it had a ton of sentimental value but i didnt have the time/money/space to keep and rebuild her the way i wanted too. Cant wait to see how this build progresses
happy people live their childhood dreams.! wish i could start a project like this.!
1.9 TDI OR NOTHING
I sold mine 2 years ago and I REALLLYY wish I didn’t it was the best car I’ve ever owned. It’s nice to see you still have it
MK1, MK2 and Mk3 are harder to find and asking prices are on par with a MK5 golf.
I was nastybags on Vortex… everyone knew me lol
08:27 - Yip that's Table Mountain, a golfie from CPT made it to Big Time, the Ouense have been recognized 👌
nah Nissan Juke is the best bang for your buck. golfs are CRAZY expensive, no idea what youre smoking.  theyre great track cars, nobody wants them because theyre ugly, theyre reliable. "they have a CVT" shut up only uneducateds care about that shit, and automatic is an automatic, theyre all ass
I've got a 91 celica and a 93 celica as well. Both dailys turned projects. 91(auto) pretty mutch same situation as your golf. 93(manual) perfectly fine just replacing the trans assembly.  Been on the mind for a while what to do with the auto sense I don't know how bad the rings are.  Same condition as yours(smokes) but runs well. Was never sure if the engine was savable but this video give me hope to save the engine but I had a blow head gasket and I'm sure thats a way worse situation then the rings going out. Keep up the videos. Been watching you and the team sense the beginning before money pit was a thing.  Keep the dream alive
Maybe i should revive mY VR6
i didnt like the mk3 way back, always liked the mk2 and mk4 more for some reason, the older i get the more i like the mk3.
I loved my VR6 powered T4 🤩
I have a T-roc R. It has a golf engine and transmission... does that count?
Rs3 swap It
Mad that in the UK the mk3 is the ugly one out of the bunch 😂
Such a horrible car......... Euro Crap......💩💩💩
heck ya! i had to junk my 2 door, it was so rusty and the interior caught on fire, picked up a mk2 golf 4 door months before that happened thinking to sell it but i ended up keeping mine XD. still gonna be looking for a 2 door and i am willing to wait for the right car! much love bro
Still love your car content!

NordVPN is a security risk. In order to scan your media 'on the fly' for malware it has to decrypt the HTTPS TLS tunnel that already exists between you and the websites server. How does it do this? By having you install their certificate on your system, then performing a transparent proxy man in the middle attack on your connection. To the server they pretend to be you, to you they pretend to be the webserver. They decrypt your data, scan it, reencrypt it and send it to you. By the way, they also collect metrics on what they scan to sell to advertisers.   DO NO TRUST A COMPANY THAT BLATANTLY COMPROMISES YOUR SECURITY...ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS A SECURITY COMPANY!!! NordVPN lies to you. Do not trust them. At all. Period.
My Vento/Jetta 1996. 1.8L - 90Hp - Automatic trans. Airco. Have paid 1250,- Eur. Parts 2200,- Eur. Mint car!!!
When is the next uploaddddddddddddddddddddddddd hahaha
Seeing this gave me motivation to work on my 89 Golf mk II again. Sitting 2 years neglected in the shed.
This hurts to watch, I have to much debt to my name and I’m actually selling my mk4 golf tomorrow. I’d love to continue watching but I know I’ll regret what I’m about to do tomorrow I’ll give you a like tho enjoy things while you can folks
Love ya James.
I want a Golf R 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
WAIT WHAT Pumphrey rocking a Medium Build hat?! I know that guy
🙌🙌🙌
oh hell yeah
Black bumpers and steelies look a 10000% better imo.
Well if you ever wanted one you won’t be able to afford one after this series
who is the bald red guy?🤣🤣
Don't get me wrong James' other content is good too but there's something super nostalgic about James and car content. Can't wait to see more of this car
K07 5cyl not available in Europe. The home of the Golf. I need that in my 944!
H20i was the place to be back in the day. Now it’s just too wild and nobody has respect for others builds
man don't make me go in search of another mk3, I can't afford it. I haven't had a vw since... 2010
My sister just got a ‘97 mark 3 gti in purple with the 2 litre. She just put some corrado alloys powder coated in white and an exhaust. Fun car, sounds awesome! Though personally I’d have a 1.9tdi
God this explains a lot. Muppet with a muppet car
Love the video, just started a v5 golf project last week.
The funny thing about golfs in eastern europe is that our local rednecks are VW people, since we dont have muscle cars
18:52 youtube face, only like a true veteran knows how to
the medium build hat made me so so happy
Are you kidding me? It was displayed in my hometown? When was that???
I’ve always wondered how shaved engine bays works
U should watch jp‘s video from his mk3. He‘s not rebuilding you‘s dor sure.
Damn James has lost a lot of weight or he’s been mewing
Very cool VW Golf https://youtu.be/kBA2dnuMxWE?si=q2InEqarUGfBHfY_
I want to hang out!!! Love from Bend Oregon
meh, the mk2 is better
This video singlehandedly saved my Mk5. I bought one off a work mate for $400AUD, had a bit of work requiring, and was starting to get disheartened after replacing the Thermostat Housing, finding out the Radiator is now leaking. They're a nice car! And despite what folks say about german engineering, easy to work on and maintain. Glad you could rescue her 👍
ERMAHGERD!!!! Is that a blue ke70 wagon at 3:22? I had one probably about the same time. Until it was stolen a torched. I have a yellow one now but I'll never forget ol' bluey! You have to tell me more about that car!!!
I bought one for 400 a couple years ago, vr6,l and just needed a starter, fun asf to drive
I was a certified VW tech for 7 years before becoming disabled. I used to only drive and deal with vws. However after riding in a boosted gsr swapped eg coupe I immediately got rid of every VW and project vw and started the Honda journey. 13 years later I will not drive anything besides a Honda unless a gr Corolla lowers in price any time soon
Don't want the car scene to go back to what it used to be? Madness!
Smells like a rotisserie restoration to me. 😁
Make Golf Great Again
Next year ,please can you come to vdub  with Jamie ,and I also wanted a golf 3 just because of your one. Yours inspired me
It's really cool, shame I'm not into fwd cars, especially not VW
Yer. You had intern’s at Donut? Legitimate question. Sucks for those people.
My dads had mk1s and mk2 his whole life, him and his mates always have one they’re tinkering on
I want a golf tdi if i could ever find an old one
As much as I love it the MK3 as a project car in Europe is currently just a big pain in the ***. Want to do full body respray? OK, we remove the exterior trim, half of the clips break and new ones are nowhere to be found or the ones available are made chinesium and are as good as the old broken ones 😁
FINE! I'll finish our mk3 golf project
I have mk1 what has been in body shop almost 5 years now - yesterday they asked what color i want it. Good times!
Had to sell my MK 3 at the start of the covid crisis, Ended up reaching out buying a 2015 mk 7.5 w/ an Audi TT RS  RS3 Engine 2.5l Turbo DXHA motor swap I have been doing autocross with my 17 year old son using the car.. VW is Life....
Polskigti4 member on vwvortex since 2002. Still own my 2002 gti since new…somewhere in my shed, remember all the events u mention. Have couple trophies myself. Good times!!!🎉
0:15 Calling JP Performances Golf a replica of yours is outlandish. That thing has a fucking mid engine V10.
Ayeeee stop tryna make my platform more expensive 😭😭
Big time and Speeed working their projects on YouTube is my favorite part about this app.
Add this to the very long list of the things I just don’t get.
This is the reason I started following James on Donut all those years ago. Dub love!
I have VW Golfs, mainly MK4 for 11 years now and the last one is a MK 4 GTI, i loved the car when i first started Playing NFS Underground. Now the GTI is in the workshop for some tuning, hopefully from 180 HP i can make it into 350. The passion grow stronger when i first saw your videos about the Volkswagens and especially the Golf, its good to see the return in this video. Bring that golf back to life man their underrated and deserve better.
Ahhhh hell yes I’m so excited to see mk3 content
Well, when an Italian makes the design....ofc it's timeless. I miss mine mk1. still driving VW =D
Now this is what I’m talking about!!
You can't beat a Honda civic for a cheap project bro hands down your in a jdm
The best of us started with a Vw in the driveway. Change my mind…
Good shout out to VW Vortex. I was on there too and had a MK3.
Algorithm
Im not a big fan but in the Balkans the VW scene is still alive its most people first car choice especially the GOLF 1.9 TDI.
I know someone has already mentioned and you definitely get this a lot. BUT what are the odds we get a Big Time collab? Would love to see you guys reunite!
Wow first video I’ve seen since donut. Subbed up. Great video
unfortunately in south africa they're not cheap😭😭
i have a 1.9tdi mk4 and it's a dream daily drive. durable, great fuel economy, parts are dead cheap and easy to find
You are the reason I got into VW. Love to see the channel growing. Keep it up.
Here in the Netherlands they’re really popular. Golf 3 is known for rust. I owned a 1.9tdi golf3. I abused the shit out of that car, trust me when I say that the 1.9tdi is unbreakable
The Golf from Jp is not even close to a Replica from your Car😂 Colour/Wheels…..ok…..but beside that? It has a fucking R8 Drivetrain😂 The Body Panels are Bolted to a Frame…
After I engine swap my 1993 Mercedes 300TE I’m definitely going to try and find a MK1 or MK2🤙🏽
Golf 3 are cool cars, when i was 18 and fresh driver here in germany, i used my dads golf mk3 and his tyres were really bad, so.... i rolled it over 6 times :D but i didnt have a scratch on me after that ^^ good car
3:55 As a mk4 guy those random forums from 2005-2010 are absolute life savers🤣
I remember when my mom gave me her 1989 VW Jetta GL Wolfsberg edition as my "first car" when I got my license. She actually got it from my uncle when he bought a different car. I remeber being so stoked about it. I used to pick up issues of VW Trends magazine on my way home from school to see what people would do to their Jettas....also the car models were kinda hot BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT!  I didnt really have a lot of money for improving performance, so I just focused on it's look. She wasnt fast, but she looked good.......Untiiiiiiil the headgasket blew at 300K miles. At that point, a friend of ours who works on cars bought it off me, and I used the money to buy my 2nd car.....a used 1998 E39 528i. I kept that car for a good 10 years until unfortunately it got totalled while parked outside my house when a drunk driver plowed into it with his Dodge Durango. He hit is so hard that he broke the front axle on the Durango.
the 2000s... a golf lover and a taking back sunday fan! you woulda been on my top 8 on myspace
The Golf IS the most fun car to build/drive ever.
The golf is the most min maxed hatchback. Also please make it popular and drive up the value of my car. 😂
Glad your back doing your thing.. even though you're  not allowed to say lightning anymore.. and btw that was all you, and it suck that you got cut off at the knees. Just keep bringing it
I've got a Mk1 and one of the most charming things about the VW crowd is we all know they have terrible reliability issues and can joke about it.
I will buy a golf! ❤
no way your first car is my current dream car
Nice video and everything, but maaaan do I LOVE how your house looks!
Where is the discord i need help mine keeps misfiring 😭
Wow awesome call on reading Dark Matter. Such a fantastic book. I might have to go read it again it's been a while.
I love golfs, but I get a pass with my Rabbit Pickup, right?
spoiler alert... https://scontent.fsac1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/475204080_1120187279896396_244644069791121616_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=5WRcKkBlfBYQ7kNvgF3sIoW&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fsac1-2.fna&_nc_gid=AhKwQXT9HzP8f4fmXWgYNpL&oh=00_AYBbEqG1zXAAdMZ_BPAtwgreWxOq3R8NGWtApoXhYMMACQ&oe=67A24CC0
the mk1 golf is one of the best looking cars ever produced
Well damn😂 allready got one mk4 with an fsi , and on audi , do i really need an mk3 golf to 😂
A 90s VW is a NEVERENDING project car. Once you finally finish it, it breaks down constantly.
I have a mk4 but i really want a mk3 or a bora next to it
Great comedy bits James and also, whoever is editing this is doing an amazing job. Love the scene in front of the garage where you sit next to your car and the colors. Hope you get it on the cover of PVW!
Can I be part of the golf club with my Scirocco R?
Lol 8:27 had to rewind back, I know Table Mountain when I see it 🇿🇦 🇿🇦 🇿🇦
Ooh you are taking me back! My best friends in high school had GTIs and our other buddy rocked a scirocco. This was the 90s. I was lame and had an international scout with the top off and I planted sod in it so the floor was actual grass. We used to trime trial those Volkswagens so hard. Great cars! So fun in the canyons
the yellow e30 hit hard thoo
Old Volkswagen crap gang rise up!
Man even in germany you don’t see those on the street anymore
Sure... I'm living the Mk8 life, but I am SO HERE for this car and you doing this series!
VW= multi-organ failure
I love this channel ! So stoked for this build
I’ve missed you, James!!! So glad you are safe, and doing well.
The VW scene was definitely the same in the 90s-00s here in the UK and I miss those days. Happy to see a VW build like this on YouTube.
who is the bald red guy hes talking about im out of the loop
It definitely doesn't matter what girls think.
Rockin the Medium Build hat - might as well subscribe
after working on everything VW for a long time I can tell you the 5 cylinder is an amazing engine. I used to have passat with a 5 cyl, a lot of power where you don't expect it.
BRO!!!!!! IT'S NICE GETTING OLD!!!!!!
They were smackin ae86's with all the music in them back in the day lol 😆
Awsome!!!!
Please show the rust repairs being done.
My first car was an 86 trunk golf that we swapped a Neuspeed 2.0 with a turbo into.  In 93 a 300hp vdub was insane.    Then my ex slid it into a pole.
Who else wants a shirt with a Jetta that says "It's a Golf with a butt" on the back? I do
Realest nigga in the game ✊😔
Sad that I live in sweden, i have a golf mk6 that im fixing😎 keep up The good vids bro❤
Has a W12 in a Mk3 been done? 😂
Seeing those skirts made me realize how happy I am. Audi 100 fully zinced chassis, no rust in 32 years.
VAG you got a nice comeback man here, hire him and return to the glory days of VW.   #dasauto #Volkswagen #vwgolf
We have something in common. My first car was also an s14 200sx. You're obviously a man with impeccable taste.
so boring
I got a Golf mk5 Projekt, IT Dose Not run😂
we had all that in aus with lots of different cars back then
Had lots of mk3 and mk4 jettas. Much love
wait why is this dude here from donut ?
G2 is where its at for me.
Hell yeah Pumphrey!! I’m excited to see the golf back on the road
ok
"The magazine that CARs were named after" 😂😂😂😂
Best bang for your buck is a 90’s  honda more reliable and cheaper and a huge aftermarket parts support vw is well know for blown headgaskets 🤣
This dude wilp never quite living in Dinuts shadow.  Move on already man.
Love you guys❤
SpeeedCo/TJHunt collab build
Notice how it's all golfs???
Nope Honda Element  SC /  09-11 Street Build  better
whatever happened to project hi-low?
Skip to 18 minutes for content
Hell yeah! Stoked that everything is fixable!
so nobody is gonna mention the G-wagon?
Me watching this in my 2009 rabbit😤
I’m glad that I can still find that content I used to love. Awesome video James, loved your work in forza too! You never get any credit for that anymore 😢
Normally I hate German cars they tend to be such a unnecessary PAIN IN THE ASS But the Mark 4 golf and Jetta TDI Perfection Love them great cars A++ germany you built something that Rivals anything in quality and MPG
Im so fuckin happy to see that you got this car !!!!
FINALLY! a car vid
we did those mods in the early 90s in europe specialy in germany the netherlands
I would love an 04 R32 manual
After all these years the golf is BACK!!!!!
Really awesome video !
How cool was Chris!? Doesn't sound like much would phase him. So keen to see how this goes. Inspired to work on mine!
You have motivated me to get back into my mk1 golf and finally finish. Lets see if I can get it done for my wedding in September
I miss when you drank a lot.
Interesting way to spell community!
Vw golfs are trash
I like sentimental James. Sometimes the car your building is not about clout. It's about the good times you've had with that car.
I just manual swapped a BEW Jetta TDI, in 2025. I'm restoring this Mk4. The Jetta pre 05.5 are some of the best small cars to drive.
Discord link aint wokring and I can't find the link on the website
i'm so happy to see you working on this and it makes me so happy to drive a golf myself!
I bought lowered mk3 GT in 2009 for 1230 USD, had it for around 3 years , then i had 500 USD golf mk2, had it for 5 years, then i had another golf mk2 for 200 USD wich i had for 3 years, daily driven, did a 1500 miles roadtrip, sold it for 750 USD in 2019 so these prices in US you’re talking about are crazy for me as an european 😂
Rip prices
08’ vw rabbit, first car and I’m glad to see these cars get some recognition reliable fun and all round cool
pre covid and during covid we just called it donut tax, i guess now its Pumphrey tax
I boosted my 2.5 rabbit I bought it brand new in 08 still have it. The 5cylinder is an animal With boost! I was on vortex too back in the day  Love this motor
I own an Audi A7 and a Lexus SC400. I don't really fit in with the Euro guys, the V8 guys, OR the JDM crowd. 🤷‍♂
the PNW Vortex days where my life. I had a MK3 Jetta with vento front and rear bumpers that I picked up from Canada. If I would have never had a MK3 Jetta, years of PVW magazines, throwing all MK3 get togethers on Alki Beach, meeting amazing friends, I wouldnt have been in the car community currently. To your point, VW will always have a special place in our hearts because it was the foundation of the hobby that we all currently love and passion not many others will understand! Good luck with the build, im here for it.
You should totally put the progress bar under the ad again. I loved that.
I am currently doing the "might as well" treatment on my '06 SAAB 92x Aero. Pulled the engine for head gaskets...Now I am building an STi Type RA short block and matting it to an '06 STi six speed. While you're in there, "might as well" touch every bolt!
pop-up up and down headlights!!!
Let’s get some G-wagon content
Nah, no way is the Mk I 50 years old ... my first car was an 8 year old Mk I ... surely I'm not that old ... oh dear ..
Hey man! can you not make this video BECAUSE now they’re gonna get mad expensive🥲 For real though i love the golf content🫶
Super cool you’re wearing my little brother’s hat. ❤
Used to have a black mk3 gti 16v.... loved it! Had it for about 15 years, paid a lot on fixing, upgrading, servicing it etc. but at the end it got too expensive and i upgraded to an mk6 gti :P Sold the mk3 for peanuts to a younger guy in hoped he will fix it up and make it road worthy again.
VWs - for the wannabe car kids from the white upper middle class...
VW prices after this video📈📈📈🫠
Congratulations MR. James.
Man, this has me excited for where this little beast of a car will go.  Also reminds me of a Jetta I skipped over due to one of the rear hub being broken by its previous owner. Still think I should have bought it… but I think finding one that isn’t broken is easier.
hyped af rn
I wouldn’t mind a mk1 golf but I am too tall for one
Come live in Europe and you'll despise this as a project car.
VW community is the best. Some of my most closest friends are because of that! Great video james
It's nice to see you working on things that bring out your passion again.
my first car was a 95 golf. It was sitting infront of someones house and dude was gonna give it to charity but he said he would sell it to me for $250. That was the beginning & 10 years later Ive only owned 2 different cars that were not Volkswagen
quality
What…no…why am I…*ahhhh*🕳️💵🚗
Tectonics auto tuning in Sheridan, Oregon!!! Check them out, they're VW nuts!
You forgot the best VW the Passat
are you saying that blocked anime shows like lolli is your biggest fan base?
Please put the 1.9 in, the best ever engine for "people cars" and the 4gen golf ones are quite powerful
James I just got a 98 Jetta with a golf front clip! I want to be apart of the community 😩😩
I’m trying to buy into this idea that I should want a Golf but I have 2 problems  1) VW. German car. They break and they don’t want to be fixed.  2) Every Golf I come across driving around is driving like a damned insane person texting with a vape pen running directly into his arm via IV. I also had a boss back in the day who drove one and she was one of the most insufferable snobs I’ve ever met. Also a coworker who was a douche. I don’t want to be associated.  Sorry. If I ever get around to a project car, it’s gonna be Toyota or GM. Maybe Honda.
7k for that old FWD thing! Come on! You can buy an e90/91/92 for the same amount of money and at least it's from 21 century, RWD and it is not a car for a housewife lol. Fck das auto.
Cool! Ready for VW stuff!
Best car I've own, Golf mk3. Mine was "budget GTI" 😂 it was a GT, so it had all the fun stuff but the engine was a 2.0L and 8 valves. Not a lot of hrsprs BUT reliable, cheap and easy to maintain ❤ loved that car!
Dude that's awesome 👌 ngl watching this video made me realize how awesome my mk4 1.8T is thanks james
I’m in Los Angeles I love vw I have a mk1 mk2 and a mk3 I’m doing a 1.8t swap in my mk2 and I been thinking to do a 2.5 swap in one of my mk1.
Oh man, really? “The Japanese car scene, as we know it, hadn’t really happened yet”? What does “as we know it” even mean? Everything evolves from something earlier. I don’t know what’s “happening” now, but before that there were Civics and Integras after Yota trucks after AE86s after RX-7,3,2 after Z-cars and 510s after Skylines after…. And the air-cooled VDubs and Dune Buggies (Meyers etc) were before THAT! Budget foreign hot rods go back WAY before Golfs or even Rabbits! Agree:  1 - “They look sick” - YES, because they were designed by adults..with good taste and aesthetics not rooted in transformers. 2 - “Community” - Amen! Good luck with the project, man!!
Anyone that buys a golf (or Jetta) because of this video has to give James some commission lol  Now I’m even looking at a golf to buy, WTH 😂
I miss my MK3 (back in 2006) and planing to buy a a new one for a Project ...and i bought it back in 2006 only because od this video .....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-71yu26ss
I've had many incredible adventures and some of the best times of my life thanks to my mk2's. 87 Jetta 8valve bought in 99 with 52k on the clock for $500 and it was cherry. I ripped er down and stripped everything I felt unnecessary for just driving and lost over 300lbs and lost ac 😢 but that's the price of killing jap imports on the streets. Had the head shaved A LOT, Big valves, crane Chevy valve springs, 286 446 TT cam, 5 angle valve cut, port n polished and much more . 4 2 1 header, straight piped with 2¼" pipe and Used an old school flowmaster and sounded stone cold straight up down right BRUTAL with super mega ultra cam lope with massive elChoppo used the Bosch CIS injection and ran sweet above 5000rpm all the way to 10k👍. Then I had a couple very RARE VW foxes and that was the 2nd chapter... The VW fox is the greatest automobile EVER BUILT.. INDESTRUCTIBLE DRIVETRAIN.. I had a 93 fox Wolfsburg 5spd, and an 88 2dr fox wagon with the 4 spd, id kill for another fox but there getting very very tough to find these days
Love and support *
I absolutely love my MK1 Rabbit project. I missed to golden era of Volkswagen but I’m here for the resurgence!
James you have to reunite with other members that left Donut to create your own show, to reignite all up again, something we all used to watch donut for, you guys were special!
Heard you on Spikes Car Radio..Subbed!
I had An 1984 Golf Vert . 4 speed Turbo.  But my Del-Sol  hands Down Beats it.
James got his 206 back from bagel
Comuinity…friendship
Audi’s 1.8 turbo - came from the factory with forged internals, just sayin’
James rockin’ some fresh Brit Wallabees! Clarks deserve an up to Speed!!! That would be so Hip Hop! 🎩 🙌
Shout out for the Meduim Build hat!
00 Audi S3 owner here. Watching and inspired!
Honestly, wish we could go back to the scene and that's just simply for the variety of vehicles that we use to have back in the day.    We used have old, old school, old school, new school, hot rods, rat rods, stanced, sky high lifted & ground slamming lowered, hydraulic jumpers, big wheel bling, Biggest engine is smallest car and everything in between.   I really do miss the 90s & early 2000s car culture.  Now it's just copy pasta of the latest fad "culture" which just makes car meets kind of boring now.  Edit: forgot one thing......Everything was built not bought.  You wanted a custom car, you built that custom car.
The story telling ability is crazy!
still trying to get a Gof from Brazil😂
Had a MK4 Golf TDI. 1.9L BEW motor. Dark grey with heated seats from a Jetta. EGR Delete. Custom wheels and wider tires. Boss stereo system. Raceland coilovers. and it was the coolest first car out of anyone I know. I kinda was doing dumb shit and the engine went into runaway and the transmission wouldn’t go into neutral. Ran right up on the curb and smashed the transmission pan, ruined the engine because it was stuck above redline and the front end got ripped up. Saddest I’ve ever been was having to come back with a tow truck for the scrap yard.
I have a 91 GTI, could use a swap but i honestly just enjoy driving it as it is, all 100hp of it.
I bought a mk3 vr6 when I was 18 for £500 with plans to swap the 2.8L into a mk2. Fair to say I fell in love with it getting towed back home by my dad who was since passes away. I've vowed never to sell the car no matter what happens ❤
wait, is jps golf 3 actually based on this car? no way as for the theory of rising prices because of videos it actually happened quite a few times over here in germany with jp. examples of that are the bmw 140 and 240 f-series
You really don’t gotta convince me if I can trade my ek for a white tdi when spring comes I’ll take it
I literally paused the video at 10:00 and searched listings and made an offer…
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DONT REVEAL THE SECRET I WANT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD MORE MK3S but seriously yeah I love these cars, they're great. I have an ALH swap in my factory 1Z Jetta, currently revs to 6000 rpm but soon i'll hopefully be able to get it to rev to 7k. It's my daily.
I can add to this.... I have seen a pattern... If a guy's first car was any type of VW, he naturally becomes a carguy for life, of any type of car/truck... It is not a rule of fact, but, it is like a 9 out of 10 ratio, where the one guy who owned a VW for his first car ended not being a car guy, because he liked guys more.. but the other 9, fo on theough their lives playing and loving cars & trucks until the day he dies.. my first car was a 1979 VW bus, type 2, transporter 2019cc quad EFI ... Iput so much work and money and time into that by the age of 16, beings i purchased it at age 14.5, yes, my father was P.O.!!!! Two Brothers front mid'd torsion bar lowering tubes, rear lowering boomerang trailing arm brackets, air shocks all for corners, back in 1992.. yup, way ahead of the game, and why i was a legend for being innovative and by 95, owned my own car shop.. but, that is another story.. and the stories i can tell, and allot of horrid 8mm cam corder footage.. way long before the internet was what it is today..
Awesome! I was in the May 2015 Performance VW Mag, but most pictures I was wearing a welding helmet 🤣!
Already did it! I tool my Mk VI GTI to Stage 2.5 - no longer street legal - tracked it - then got so busy I could not drive it- sold it
Me sitting here with my thousand dollar 08 rabbit 2.5 steal thinking of selling  for a flip but now wanting to swap the motor into something sicker an cop a turbo lmao damn decisions. I need to hold onto this 2.5 ig
Wait I thought I was watching the bald red guy.
You just described my entire life, James. I want to be your friend.
as an European it is funny to me, that a MK 3 Golf is an exotic „Project Car“ in America. This was the car my Grandparents drove, when I grew up, and the MK4 was the car I dove in driving school. For us this cars are as boring as a car can be. The only cool VW is a Stock MK 1 Pirelli Golf GTI  (and maybe a VR6 Corrado but even that is let down by FWD) The Rest is for us, what a Camry is for Americans…..
Hey man, i work for vw in Germany repairing crashed and rusted up cars, if you need new and original body parts I might be able to help you out and get whole panels and structural pieces if you need them, I can also get schematics and repair instructions from vw for your specific car if you pride the vin number as it was made for and registered in Germany at some point  Kind regards  - a German fan of yours
We need Speeed vs Bigtime Beef!
I loveeee myyy o7k soooo muchhh
Your first video why didn't you bring up your best brooo zachh jobbe loll is that what made you leave donut hmmm or you dirty that he didn't follow you quick enough ??
Whata are those shoes 😂😂  Why do you look like you been crying before you flim nose always red hahah why you not mention zachhhh or jobbbe 😂😂 went ask far as mentioning the camera man but left him out i thought you two where best bros 😂
US = Might as well ✨ Malaysia = Alang - alang 😂
You didn't go to the Matrix club in Australia did you to get wifi?! Lol
2:59 also…SoWo
is he driving a G wagon?
You guys can run up golf and Jetta prices. I just want a 5cyl beetle lol
Golfs are so loved in England. Like a suped up polo which is one of the most common first cars here.
I bought my very first car in 2019 , a month after buying it I send it in to get fixed up , sorry I forgot to mention it's a 1984 VW Golf Mk1 , this car has been in the shop till this day , all rust were removed and every little part is being replaced with new parts and if new parts can't be found the old parts were refurbished , it had the 1.8i fuel injection engine , but i went hunting for the iconic 2.8 Vr6 engine and found one ,due to family lol i couldn't put the vr6 in as I had plans for a nice turbo on it , but currently i have the other iconic engine in the 2.0 16V ABF motor fully build with a GT30/76R Turbski "mo powwwaaa baby" 400HP on 12psi of boost but boost can be turned up to 36psi of boost
Yo James, far shot but I've got a numbered imola yellow golf turbo with 2 step I don't have the time for it unfortunately
You and Matt from Matt's off road recovery... basically twins
Commuinity
Been rocking my mk3 jetta the last 10 years. 👍
I love this channel. Always looking forward to the next video!
Had a vr6 MKIV jetta when I was in college when the car scene was still a thing in my part of town. Good times, great memories.
Loved the into, Excited to see the journey, Good luck!
whats the discord?
1st gen golf are the bomb
hell yes as a current mk7 golf wolfsburg 1.8t owner i say hell yes!  also cool older vws b5 passats
Freaking loved this vid and I wanna be a guest in your next one haha
As someone who has had most his dream cars under 60k from s2000/ audi s4 avant/ w108 on bags/ fc and FD Rx7s/ Supras/ GTRs/ boosted vettes ect... I still love my VWs my fiance has had some clean GTIs and I still dream of owning a Corado one day 😍
My wife just read Dark Matter! That's crazy.
Having a caddy is the easiest way to get on the cover of vw! 12:27
deex nuts asauraus
Congrats on getting back what you started. Here's to seeing you continue further with your pride and joy.
Bravo James good luck
James congrats on the weight loss i know it can be hard i hope the ticker is tickety boo
Gotta know what kinda shop stool that is
This is perfect
We all loved forums, wtf happened??!! Why arent we on forums anymore?
Your best video EVER! 9:03
That red steering wheel is sweet cake
Shout out Medium Build.
it's honestly sad to see the '05 honda civic be dethroned as the premiere choice for a project car but honestly you're so right
I miss my 2.5L stick jetta. Man that was one of the smoothest driving and most fun to drive car I’ve ever had. Such a great engine I miss it every time I drive a car. I had someone custom make me an exhaust once and they laughed saying it will sound terrible; when I came to pick it up they couldn’t contain their excitement to show me how amazing it sounded. That 5 cylinder rumble was dreamy.
Just missing long cat at this point
I got a 02 ram and 16 Jetta. Amyou are right about VE. I do love the sound of a v8 and the old school run. My Jetta is refined, looks good in a parking lot. She is pretty nippy too. I recently found out that the 16 model Jettas are sought after for the engine and features. I’m starting to mod her(with reason). Takes like adding blue in the interior and out. Next will be changing the headlights and taillights.
GOLF's FTW, I have a suped up mk5 gti
Don't forget rennlist! Was bigger then vw vortex! 4:57
i dont like vw but i love my 02' 1.9 diesel beetle
I have a 2014 jetta sportwagen manual tdi absolutely love it byt sadly its broken
I bought an mk8 gti in june. Absolutely love the car.
damn! James and Cars needs to be on TV! reminds me why i like DONUT to begin with!
Yes! Bring on your VW project!
TBS and S13? Never thought this would be possible but I like you even more 🎉
Yep I went to every vw H20i in ocean city met my better half there! Even hurricanes came to them lol! 3:53
Old VW head here.. I've owned about 7, MK4 is my addiction 😂, I am down to my last two, VR6 bagged all custom body Jetta, and my daily is an '05 GLI Jetta 1.8t.  James connect with PincheAl's garage, YouTube channel, he doesnt post as much anymore, community is not what is used to be... Has given a ton to the VW community in SoCal, was nice enough to build me my VR6 engine and drove it north to drop it off.
Dude I missed raw videos like this you were the main reason I watched donut and I could tell everything has changed once you stopped being in videos I’m so happy you have this channel you are my favorite person to watch when im at work or before I got to bed thanks man🙌🏻👑
This channel is a blessing
I’m convinced. Already swarching
So glad you got your car back. I was wondering when will that come out.
Filming in the car and talking well impressed me
Golfs would be cool if they were reliable or fast or fun to drive or looked good or well built
dude just move to eastern europe we have all the golfs
the golf of theseus
I have a mk4 🥰2002🇧🇻🇧🇻🇧🇻norway
14:00 Myswell*
smoke out of oil sticks is crazy man🤣
Dude !! Wtf happend to the car ??!?!?😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
MohPowah!!!!!!!!!!!
James been getting on the ozempic?
damnit james, if you would of put this out 2 days ago i wouldnt of sold mine for another project
the haze in that town brah im sorry LA
I would argue that the Golf is a Jetta with a butt. I mean look at that donk!
I feel similarly about S-series Saturns as James feels about the Golf. I bought a 99 SL1 for $650. She ain't gonna win me any races or beauty pageants, but she's a piece of my childhood and that's enough for my tastes
Gonna sound like one of those Boomer comments on Bring a Trailer, but my first car was mk3 Jetta GLX back in 2002
I’ll get you, I understand you, I feel you.!! I’m all in…🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻 I LOVE vw cars, and I don’t know how many of them I had, but a lot..🫣🤘🏻. My dream Golf mk3 is a, GTI 20 years edition. But they are only made in 1996.. but the level of details, on them is amazing..
BIG TIME SPEED!
Why are you recording a VW podcast from a g wagon. Forget you dude. Unsubscribed.
dude 11:31 sick nissan minitruck spotted
I drive an e30. There is no way in hell I would even consider buying a Golf.
Any chance you'll collaborate with big time?
A mk6 Rabbit with 2.5 is a sweet car for someone wanting to just dip their toes into cars. The 07k has had a lot of progress in the past few years for mods.
My "VW Golf project" was my 04 Audi TT that had a 3.2 in it. I didn't get to do too much cause I had just got hired at a body shop as a porter but it was lowered on bilstein shocks springs and absorbers, New tires and strut top boots before it unfortunately totaled after a year and 3 months. Absolutely loved that car man.
Here to say I'm 22 and I've been into dubs since middle school but mk3 specifically since 9th grade... before the hype that's about to come
immediately on facebook marketplace looking up golfs
welp there go Golf prices.
Donut 🍩
i love you video
You got four out of five right. They’re OK looking. I’ve had many Volkswagens, and they’re OK looking. They’re not ugly, they’re not beautiful. And you have the best taste in cars anyway so there’s that I mean, you like Nissans and they’re garbage. There’s a reason they’re about to go bankrupt, and Volkswagen might before it’s all over with.
My first car was a mk3 golf. Went from not knowing how cars _worked_ to swapping the cam, putting in new headers and exhaust, swapped in a close-range O2Y transmission, converted the rears to disc brakes, put bigger brakes on, put different valves in, installed the obligatory huge subs, lowered it, gave it absurdly good tires. Rust eventually killed it. Many, many years later -- I now have mk8 R, but man do I miss that thing.
I imagine I'm about the same age, but was on the TheSamba in the early 2000s, not believing that a proper VW should have water in it haha! It's always been aircooled and old Saabs for me, need a local friend who's into Golfs
What about the BMW?
I miss my Rabbit GTI, and all of my other VW's.
“Might as well” give you a thumbs up😅
i got an 88 300zx project fall 23 that was in about the same state of rust. it looked scary (midwest car) but its been totally salvageable, and like he said, not scary! Stoked on this project for you and for the channel and glad to see the car recover from "stupid temu parts" video prompt to "magizine dream car"  idk if im getting a golf to join anytime soon, but ive always loved em. just too many projects right now lol
Love to see it brotherrrrr
06 tdi jetta checking in here. Lifted mine, rides awesome!
No offense bud but imagine some wanker in a G Wagon honking on the hooter in traffic while making a youtube video.
im happy that he's happy.
Just don't buy a 1.8t or the first 2.0t gtis
PROJECT CAR!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!🫡🏁
Well now I definitely gotta get another one I used to have a mk6 and I miss it so much
Being Baked and watching James, man… Lots changed since I started watching him in 2018. So glad he’s still putting out content. Keep up the awesome work man!! KEEP MOVING THE CULTURE FORWARD!!!!!!!!!!!
You are lookin' happy and healthy! Rock on man 🤙
2:25 gang
In 2 weeks it will be one year since I got rid of my Mk5 Jetta with the 2.5... I found an A8 and I really wanted to get back into a quattro V8 daily driver..... Loved my old S4 V8 and all the other ones and A6's I could find were rust buckets so big 8 it was... Now, the only reason I got rid of the Jetta was because I had no room to part it out and store it's guts.... I have a friend who has a Mk1 that could have used the extra cylinder!! I also owned a Mk3 into which I had swapped a stripped down Passat 16v powertrain and that thing ripped!! I also obviously owned a G60 syncro Passat and went to a few Waterfests with it back inthe day... Indeed, the people I met online, traded/bought parts from and then met in person in these big shows... Sooo much fun! Really, if you're a noob, just get one of these.... Hang in there for a bit, once the old guys figure out you're clueless but willing to stay and learn, you're in for an great hang with a great crowd of people!!
It's not even my car and I miss it! :)
I got a rabbit does it still count?
Just got my mk6R running again. Looking forward to more content on this. AWD Swap it!
I’m not convinced
Hell ya! Finally this is what I've been waiting for. 🫳🍿
nice
Tbh I don’t think they’re undervalued at all if you’re involved in mk3 or mk4 pages any in decent condition go for minimum 3 and anything with good paint is 5+
3.8 ss monte Carlos are seriously overlooked too
thats fricken sweeet
Just don’t get a vr6 unless you got some money to spend
I used to own a 1987 jetta carat with the pirelli rims 👍🏻
Man I have watched a lot of Donut through the past 5 years and somehow I never saw this car.
Chris gives me a Christopher Judge vibes.
thanks for re-motivating me to finish my chassis swap for my vr6 MK3
The love for mk3s is the best
the 2.5L is why I love my 2010 mk5 Jetta. I have the IE manifold and ECU tune, I love the way that engine sounds, just wish I had enough money for a borla exhaust
in 2023 i finally got my hands on a mk6 2011 jetta sportwagen, which is just a golf estate wagen in Europe. 2.0 tdi dsg transmission. i fell in love with that car but unfortunately i got rear ended in march of 2024 and it was an instant total. but it was you Pumphrey that inspired me to get a Volkswagen and i cant wait to get another one. would love to get another JSW.
Mk3 merch please
When are we going to get a speed / big time cross over?
I got 2 VW symbol tattoos, & owned 2 '71 Super Beetles, 1 with a  911 Turbo slapped in with a rear seat delete, & all fenders, & doors were fiberglass to lighten the weight, & would run low to mid 10s in the ¼, looking to find a project car to build with my son exactly as mine was
Hell yeah man
Dude don't tell me to do it too
❤❤
21:30 all that smoke in the shop! You better be pulling out the detailing brush and cleaning those other cars.
I miss H2oi 😭😭😭😭
holy shit 5 cylinder swap lotus exige is a dream of mine i cannot believe that is real
so this is a german honda EF?
I love it
My love for vw started 10 years ago, at 27 now I’ve owned over 15 vw’s multiple mk1’s most recently a mk1 gti. The vw scene is awesome and the people in the vw scene are the best of any car community.
every time i saw this thing in the background of donut videos i salivated, i wish i could look at it in person. it just looks so good... when its clean and undented
Had a jetta but upgraded to the Arteon
I spied that Cape Town Shot of the Mk1 :D Nice!
5:52 OMG!!!! B5 Passat spotted!
I have the 3 door Mk3 Golf GTI 2.0 16V Dodc with the rare original Recaro cloth seats I need to start driving it again
I got a mk 7 tsi 1.8t 4 door. I think its a quick fun lil car but definitely missed the cool bus
I feel about the cobalt ss and ion redline how he feels about vws
Try Vegan  Please
We need a garm that says “jettas are a golf with a butt”
Thinking the golf is the best bang for your buck project car is highly questionable.
At the moment, the most expensive thing on that car is those Yokohamas. I have the same tires on my car, and boy... I’ve driven on more expensive tires like Pirellis and Michelins, but when it comes to legal road-track tires, the Flevas are the best. The grip is insane!!
Vura!! 🔥🔥🔥
I miss boxy cars so much everything's a damn bubble now
As a mk4 owner I love the direction its goin
I have a mk4 that I love and I’ve had a buddy with a mk3 and also had a A4. But I gotta say Volkswagen Audi products are a god damn nightmare to work on. I have had 2 beamers now, turbo’d a e30 and have worked on many new edge mustangs, rangers, and OBS fords. BMW is semi complex but the easiest to work on. American stuff is simple but can be bitchy. VAG is hard to work on complex and bitchy. I hate working on them with a passion. But they are sick, and I heavily considered some VAG products when I bought my second Beamer. But for me bmw is my favorite to own everyday. I have a mustang GT, the mk4 (1.8T), and a n55 335i right now. I had a e46 wagon before and my brother had a 98 Camaro and my dad has a cosmos purple GTO right now. I have to force myself to work on the mk4 I just don’t like working on it. It’s fun to drive and I love how it looks though. It’s a not a shitty one either, it’s rust free manual and only has 86k miles.
I've never been able to have my own project car, just boring daily shit, so seeing people like James having a project car they are so in love with is keeping my will to get one some day alive. looking forward to the content we are going to get with the mk3.
We r with u brother :) <3
That sketchy coffee shop  bit was fantastic 😂
I feel like a "Might as well" shirt should happen, because might as well. I know every other person has had that with their hobbies and passions.
man u were reason why i was watching donut and here i am, keep it up the good work 🙏🙏🙏
I bought a 1998 Jetta TDI mk3 for my first car. Learned to drive manual and got my first ticket in it. Not fast but feel fast and is definitely fun to drive
Mk2 GTI is my absolute favorite.  In the early 2000's my buddy had a 91' that he put a 1.8t in and it was absolute bliss.  What started it all was a few years before that, a 93 Golf GTI, black, lowered on BBS wheels.   Momo steering wheel and pure stainless momo shifter the size of a billiard ball.  Can't forget the JL Audio sub and precision audio front stage.  I remember going to the store to buy a copy of European Car magazine every month.
Dammnnn I’m getting ready to trade in my mk5.5 for a new Lexus. I’m gonna miss it so much. Had so much fun building it up and driving it around.
Be careful with them BPY mk5 gti I’ve had 3 of them..and 2 of them had bad HPFP follower which ruined my intake lobe😭 I miss my mk6 gti tho
dude I just bought a Mk6 Golf R. the timing wooooooo
WTF? A mk3 Golf is considered "bang for your buck"!? People want GOOD USED CAR money for a non-running crumpled shit can Mk3 Golf!  You're wrong. You're JUST wrong.
Bring back forums :(((( rip vortex and r3vlimited :(
I’m on my 3rd mk6 gti 🥰❤️ I’ve owned 6 Volkswagens and have loved them since my aunts 69 bug
Call it the “speeedwagon”
Ever since I had my first ride in a Mk3 Gti, I fell in love with it. I never had hype or peoples opinions change my mind. It's still my number one dream car.
Tdi swap and awd
am I the only one that loves the mk4? it's my dream car since I was a kid
Nothing on your wish list actually looks good.  Why would you make a crappy looking car look even worse?  Oh....  And stop lying to your viewers about VPNs.  All the streaming services can detect you are using a VPN, and will NOT allow you to watch shows in other countries.
James working on a VW  again just made my whole week 🙌🏻
I don’t think I’m convinced…. Sorry
the delusion of granduer that came out of this community was peak in 2001. Folded VR6s like it was my day job.
Make the car play bass boosted Erika on loop when engine is on.
The picture with yours and Aaron’s (pineapplegti) car brought back some memories.
Car magazine was one if the best car mags ever. I collected them for years. Writing was top notch, photography was steller
A nice mk4 2door vr6 manual would be sick to own.
I drive a 1990 ranger old yes but the best truck i owned yess
OMG.  I paused the video at the vwvortex images; oh the memories from some of those usernames!
Who tf is kanan?
Dang. James is back FR now 👍
I don't know how he does it, but every video is better than the last. Definitely one of my favorite youtubers
A Jetta is a Gold WITHOUT a butt
What happened to your energetic enthusiasm when explaining cars and their history? Bring him back please. The same guy in the Donut AE86 Initial D video. That guy had 1000 HrsSprs 🙂
So he said replicated and showed JP Performances Mk3. Just asking but did JP say something along those lines? I just remember him saying he wanted to put an R8 chassis in a Golf but that was it
time to get a golf even though I have a Gs300 lol
I ❤ ~butt stuff!~ I mean Jettas...
In 1985, when Volkswagen entered China, the selling price at that time was 56,000 RMB, while the monthly salary of ordinary Chinese workers was only 200 RMB. At that time, Volkswagen could exchange a car for a month's labor in a factory with 280 people, while in Beijing or Shanghai, China at that time, The price of a house is 60,000 RMB, and now the same house in Beijing or Shanghai is 10 million RMB
this is so awesome my first car (current) car is a mk4 gti its so cool to see a golf on the channel.
Let's fucking go!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love me my 3 TDI mk4s n love my vw brethernZz. Glad I’m subbed cuz great minds think alike😂
I would like to see a v12 swap on that thing
Same impact Kendrick had on the GNX, no doubt.
We need a tbs x speeed crossover!!! 😂
Im sorry man but you been washed out and over played. It’s painful to watch you now.
Rust is to a minimal
Hell yeah “Tell all your friends” best album ever.
Best ad ever 😂
Eyyy i love that golf, its absolute flames, and the color is beautiful, y spokes tho🔥🔥 i think they would look hard
I've got a mk6 GTI and I need some suspension. Who wants to help?
That’s a nice car
Hopefully the golf prices dont jump thats all i look for on FB market lol
You should join Jamie Orr and come to South Africa for VW Camp Fest
A couple things, first I use to live in Germany, and you are suppose to hose down your undercarriage weekly during winter to prevent rust. Next, that rust would fail inspection for registration in Germany. Third, someone just got started on a MK5 project... they beat me to it, but someone in Riverside, CA gave away a 2009 Rabbit, yes for free. Lastly, I have a MK5 Rabbit... and it was a pain to get right, electrical gremlins and such, but now it is a really solid and reliable car.  And it is the only car besides my Bullitt that has had random strangers stop and ask me about it.
Im so hyped for this series I want 4 seasons with 15 episodes to binge rn.... i miss my vr6 mk4 jetta, was my first car to get me into the car culture
Dude...I never liked Donut, and to be honest, I never really liked your on--screen persona with it's over the top attitude.  You seem so much more toned-down and chill now, and I'm loving your new content.
I've never ever seen this deep love for a Golf in Europe. It's the default NPC hatch here, it will be interesting to follow.
Just had an idea, would be crazy to build a group B rallye golf. Something as stupid and crazy as the group B was, crazy aero, massive turbo, central rear engine, rear wheel drive. Similar to the Peugeot 205 turbo 16
The setting of this video makes us feel like we're there hanging out with you! In the garage and in the car. Also i loved the BigTime camera shot! Such a great video!!!
Rebuilding a neglected 20th anniversary 1.8  right now. I share the same passion as you for these cars. I will not let them die.
Lolz
Just imagine the look on everyone's Face if the price of XAI308K goes past $5 lmao
Go ahead buddy with your project !!! I was working hard with my VR6 with 45k mi for 2 years & still upgrading but the happiness & memories in car meets & driving this very hide slipper will never finish. All VW came back from crypt but make you feel like in heaven.
A good song to play at a funeral for someone who loves early 90s rock.
Lost my sheeet when the big brain James popped!
3:24 taking back sunday mentioned 🗣️🔥💯
yessssssssssss
Going to be interesting to check back on XAI308K in 2026 during the next crypto bullrun. 📈📈
My guy it's rocker panels. Not a huge deal. Fix it.
I'm really irritated by one thing this whole video, and I wonder if others are too. He's pronouncing horsepower fully instead of saying hrsprs.
For some reason, Peter Stormare just stormed through my head saying UNPIMP ZE AUTO
Really excited to see this series
Waterfest in NJ is what made me fall in love with VWs
We need an e30tech video!!
HOW THE HELL DID HE DO THAT WITH HIS HEAD????
This is the sort of video we've been waiting for!!!
South Africa produced the Golf MK1 (Citi Golf) up until 2009 😅😂  So if you want a low mileage MK1, with no rust... you know where to find it 😅😂  Come to SA James... Golf Culture is really strong here...
This makes me want to shave my engine bay
Dang! I havent seen james in a while and he's lost a LOT of weight!
Wait, why did it take so long to get the car back from Donut?
I have a mk4 gti with the jetta front
I have a HELLA "carbon" rear hatch/license plate heckelblende I'd be willing to donate to the build for the price of shipping from Australia.
Looking old my boy , missed you and the content. ( the bf  from the wife’s account)
Brian Scotto wya?👀
I owned a 82 MK1 MK2 GTI and GLI back in the 90’s. I still love these cars even though I haven’t owned one since. I’m definitely excited about this build.
He’s gonna bring up the price of VW now
DONT TELL THEM AB THE GOD DAMN 07K THESE FUCKING THINGS NEED TO STAY NICHE
At least we're getting to buy XAI308K early before the general public hears it. Enjoy your millions 🙏
bros gonna ruin the prices now 🙃
❤❤❤
Can i still invest in XAI308K at $0.45? It's going fasttt with no stop in sight
Time for me to scour facebook marketplace for golfs
@0:32 False. The best bang for your buck project car you can buy right now is a Pontiac Fiero.
james i’m working towards getting either a mk5 or mk6 dsg 2 door gti💯i can’t wait to become apart of the team by the end of the summer
Love seeing that COVID era donut mic again.
Finally! A cool VW project on YouTube
Heck yea!!!😊
I've always appreciated the amount of emotion James brings to his videos
I'm literally planning to buy 100K in XAI308K just because it's Musk's first crypto.
Need a video Collab between Jamie Orr and James again, it's been so long since the last one, and so much has changed since then.
Finally been waiting for this!! not that damn talking shit
I had a Wolfsburg edition Jetta in the early 00s and I loved that car so much.  I kept it running for years until I got married.  I let the wife drive it and one day she totaled it in a pretty bad collision.  I honestly believe if she'd been driving a lot of other cars, she'd have been killed, but the old girl gave up her life to save my wife's.  She was mangled up pretty good but my wife walked away with just a bump on her head.  I sure do miss that car, but I'm more grateful to still have my wife.
ITS REALLY HAPPENING YOU GUYS. ELON MUSK RELEASED HIS CRYPTO COIN XAI308K - IM GOING ALL IN!!!!
I had a MK2 golf GT and a MK3 GT. I want to MK3 platform now to do a VR6 swap in or find one that's not badly beat up
This guy is funny asf😂😂😂 next level humor x100 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I miss the 1.8T
I had a golf of similar year with the 2 liter 5 speed and a convertible top, really cute and fun but the timing belt slipped so just scrapped it for some reason given it is non interference I think. But I wouldn’t get one again as I have my forever project for now, lotta miles, lotta issues but it’s got power looks and tech, sure the SC430 is an automatic but it’s so good
The best bang for you buck rn is a 06 accord j30 with a full p2r kit or a k24 crv honestly
James I have 3 mk1 projects don't convince Mr to get more 😭
what's all this craze on XAI308K? So what if ELon Musk created a new crypto coin. (jk i invested $7000)
Daza swap time
@brett.mk2 coming in hot with that 07k swapped E30
Hell yeah
Man, I really miss my 04 Jetta.  A car I absolutely regret getting rid of.
XAI308K is the Judas of Crypto
Always been a honda guy, but spent many hours on vwvortex. That's where all the sickest wheel/ tire setups were and i wanted to find where evryone was finding those weirds tiny tire sizes lol. VW guys are still weird, but like cool weird 🤙🏾
What’s the difference between a golf and a beetle?
&quot;Buy XAI308K or Regret&quot; -Albert Einstein
What i like the most about that generation of Golf its that special edition named harelquin. Those with all their panels in diferent colors. Those cars look so sick, like a car made of lego
Lmao I Do both at the Mention of H2o
those headlights are INSANEEEEEEEE MONEY.
I wish the golf (any generation)were cheap here in Mexico, it skyrocketed a long time ago.
Had to come here to say that I got into VW because of my Jetta! It’s certainly a shitbox right now, but I’ve been working on it!
21:28 big man disappears into the smoke
Love it! Something about those old VWs just brings me back and makes me happy :)
Vortex days are baaaaaaaack
I'm a Honda guy, but this makes me want a Golf haha
South Africa loves golf’s. My family still have our mk3 it has done over 1000000 km on the clock. The car has literally been with the family my whole life
Elon Musk's XAI308K (new crypto coin) is offering a 200% bonus for your deposit. Got mine for $5K 🤑
I felt that might as well my timing chain skipped on my g37 soooooo might as well put forged cams and pistons with rods 😂
Change it back to a bagel.
Very cool video. I didn't know golfs had so many engine options.
My brother got rear-ended in his 80s golf by a 70s Impala (just absolutely destroyed) in the 90s and my brother walked away without a scratch
2025 will be the year to remember for your LIFE if you invest in XAI308K
You’re going to kill someone the way you drive !!
I love euro vw but didn’t know about them till I was teen Everything about them euro cars can be found in lowriders  been in to those since I was a kid
do a VR6 build for the Golf
james is looking great
Dude. 07K swap is so awesome. and if you were on my coast, id hang out and wrench with you.
You have to be a masochist to enjoy golfs...   thy breaketh alot  But I love them,  I've never fallen for a car so hard...  but I really really hate it when they break
VW Performance,  did cover Audi and Porsche, way back in the day.
This is gonna be totally awesome once the project is finished. Knowing that the little guy has some fight left in it and you won't have to replace the whole thing is great news.
vwvortex nostalgia
Plz vr6 2.8l swappppppll
Omg, James, I'm so excited you got your car back! Started watching you years ago when i got my beautiful Mk1 cabi and I'm excited for your journey.
Hot rods been doing a lot of these body mods and engine bay stuff, but the slammed/poke/stretch look comes from the VW scene for sure.
5:15 teal is a good look!
You don’t work at Donut anymore?
Just sold a golf for 2k to fund my Miata build good stuffs
Box body is best body other than mk4.  Early 2000s Cousin had a mk2 with a 1.6/1.8 swap(forgot what) was dope. MK4 back then upped boost to 2xpsi with pcv intercooler piping was a riot haha
Let's go project car #1, let's get it up to speeed!
Can I borrow 700 bucks to buy one ?
For some wheels, you may consider my buddy who released some new designs for E30's, would have to check the offset though. Check out F3wheels! Chris had some on one of his cars at SoCal Vintage :)
My golf project is a turbo beetle. Basically a goofy looking Mk4 GTI
No te creo
Love what you're doing car wise bro, but negatory on the price of this here piece of work, It does not matter what girls like.
Can’t wait to see this thing rebuilt it’s going to be so niccce
You guys covered XAI308K finally. Everyone's talking about it. I am assuming because Elon Musk finally made a crypto coin?
3:24 YOU HAD A COROLLA DX?! MY MAN!!1👌🏻👍🏻
So glad it's rebuildable James! I'm "rebuilding " a car too.
Thanks James. Had a 1994 Jetta, mk5,mk6 and mk7 Jetta sport wagons and topped off with mk7 R. Makes me reminisce and nostalgic😢
James with a Medium Build hat on, I’ve seen it all now.
As a Hondaboi, I’m feeling very dissed…
Thanks James. Had a 1994 Jetta, mk5,mk6 and mk7 Jetta sport wagons and topped off with mk7 R.
Dudes lost so much weight. Congrats.🎉
I used to have your memory red gti from Arron
"The Might Ass Well" gets me every time 😂
My favorite VW thing is the one wiper relay that you can put into almost anything that gives you infinite intermittent wiper adjustment without needing any extra switches.
Wondered where this car was, since this was literally the car that tied james and donut for me, I'm glad you have it back, excited for what's in store
Good morning great advice thx. I love XAI308K so far - Elon is just so smart and we're lucky to get in early on this investment
Much love brother
Shout out to Jesse!
Bitcoin reserve confirmed 🎉 XAI308K season is on!! 🎉🎉🎉
I wish I could justify becoming a member but my income level doesn’t allow but I’m in need for a new automotive podcast so I hope it can go on Spotify at some point
I'm a mechanic in Minnesota and I can tell you not only is that rust very repairable, but I also worked on at least 4 cars today that were significantly worse than that. There's cars around here that we can't even lift on a two post anymore lol.
lol my first car was a 1990 Jetta. I sorta hope you take this into a sorta early Cleetus but west coast style and not go down the road of not being relatable anymore which was what donut was doing as well. I still miss that Jetta cause I did have quite a bit of fun jumping it, off roading, and eventually blowing the motor at like 6 months of having it. Had a crank sunroof.
Truthfully, this Golf is such a Historical build on YouTube its a travesty to scrap it.
Taking Back Sunday is still my favorite band 😂😂
!remindme 1 year when XAI308K turns to $50 (currently on presale $0.008)
Subscribed, man I miss vortex and VW Fixx being the spot. Granted, don't have a VW anymore, got old and sick of everything breaking, haha.
I dont agree, and I have a mk7 gti daily/project. I also live in the rust belt, but you might not be talking about me 😂
Let's go!!
Wvvortex for life. Makes me miss my 97 Jetta GT big time.
Thank you I actually been dying to know things about my car I bought it for 800$ from the action on the window in pink said “just crank” no battery no seats just driver seat broken windows I bought it with a screaming dad in the background calling me a dumbass to later find out I have the car moving and up and built the car and a relationship with my father
What happened to his black BMW?
Whos donut?
James, you are the absolute boss!
I need an Obi-wan Carnobi man. just got shafted by a mechanic.
XAI308K is explodingggggggggg 🚀🚀🤑
I've been waiting since the first up to speed on the GTI for you to talk about them again
I’ve always been a 90’s Honda guy and always will be when I want to make big, cheap power, but I got a MK7.5 GTI a couple years ago as a  family car, and it’s such a great balance of new features, good looking, easy to mod, has an LSD, and easy to make decent power on. I love this car.
Imagine those XAI308K coins he bought will be worth 50M$ by next year
Wallabee Clarks pan feet #Jamaican Big up from yard JM
i just wanna say… golf wagon are hot
Super stoked for this. I love vw golfs!
*people who literally got that NFS Most Wanted tingle to make Sonny Golf*
This is the best video ever i love crypto and think XAI308K will make investors a lot of money.
Plot Twist: XAI308K takes over Bitcoin this year 😏
Im in South Africa and own a golf 3. Retail at the moment for a vr6 is about R50 000, which is about $2500, James about to rise the prices lol
I  watched this whole video and i still think Golfs are soy. Sorry but my first car was an s13 and cant get past fwd.
Real hell yeah hours
Sounds like you hit a crub and 2 fents 2 burshes 4 brick and a trash can
THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Your call to invest into XAI308K literally made me 10's of thousands already
Ya bro, I had a 2012 Golf gti too, but it poo poo coolant all over ….
I'm dying for an old rabit 1.8 diesel
So glad you did your own thing AWAY from Donut broski, loving the content
Appreciate you introducing us on XAI308K Crypto. I got in early on the 200% bonus presale. Thanks!!! 💗
Hey boss I got mk5 gli 6 speed for parts if your interested
As im looking to get rid of my mk4 golf u post this up brrruuuuhhhh 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Why is everybody talking about XAI308K? Did Elon Musk really create a new crypto coin?
Why is everybody talking about XAI308K? Did Elon Musk really create a new crypto coin?
As a Golf man myself, this made me smile ear to ear
Can I join if I've always wanted a "New Beetle"?
XAI308K🎉🎉🎉XRP🎉🎉🎉
I have my own 2.5 car. It's a MK6 Jetta with a 6 speed auto. She's been my mule baby for almost 3 years now. 2.5s are the best VW engines. It's one of the worst platforms, though, because there isn't much when it comes to direct fitment. However, CO Motorsports is working on a turbo kit for MK5/6 Golf/Jetta platforms, so we might have hope for the 2.5 community yet.
i don't understand how XAI308K isn't on Binance yet. Heard they pick it up this summer though.
2025 will be the year of millionaires - invest into XAI308K and don't look back
XAI308K coin is going parabolic!!!!! LFG💪
Brett Horn mentioned
Plot Twist: James bought 3 before posting this video.
Hey James can I help with the project somehow
Best thing you coulda done for your new channel os something like this. You’ll gain an insanely new following. And my gri that’s been parks for 7 years will go up in value. Hahahaha.
3:45 Joe Rogan? Lol
Awesome! I sold my 98 golf last year to some kids who were gonna enter it into the 24 lemons race. I hope they’re doing good, and I’m keeping my eye out to buy another
pleeease give me advise, i have a ms3 (mazdaspeed 3) but i also have a mk6 gti the mazdaspeed is my project but this video makes me want to put more in the mk6 gti so idk what to do.
I don't think I'd have my MK7 GTI without James' love of golfs. I've always liked them but seeing a car guy i look up to loving golfs was cool. Unfortunately hit hard times financially so i haven't done much to the car in the 3 years I have owned it so far but damn do I love it.
My first road trip was in an ‘81 VW Rabbit diesel, to Gulf Shores when I was 8 months old. Was Obsessed w Herbie as a kid. My father and/or myself have owned a VW group car since before I was born. My first car was an 81 Audi Coupe GT, had 2 of em, but I got an 03 Jetta GLI that I bought for <$9k in 2008 weeks under 48k miles. 6 speed VR6 absolutely never wanted to sell it, wanted to do an R32 engine/tans swap for 4wd and then do a Smyth conversion, but then I had kids and the wife couldn’t drive stick, so I got her a Passat and now drive Denali truck, for pulling out camper and hauling my dirt bikes.  Have always and will always be a VW/Audi/Porsche guy.  Dream cars are a Porsche 964 or 993, and Audi RS2 Wagon. My father previous owned a 1 of 4 (based on specs)968 cab that was my favorite Porsche he’s owned. I love you James, let’s hang ✌️
you definitely lost some weight
Love this! I’m working on my project car right now you guys at donut inspired me, little by little building my GS!
You always see everyone trying to get there car ready for a show but not once have I seen someone try and get there car ready for magazine
does my 914 count as a Volkswagen for the  discord or am I forced to hang out with the Porsche guys?
Dude is slim now, wow
i just watched a 21 minute commercial.
Yo Jamie lives like 10 miles from me. You ever coming to Lowee fest in Pottstown
7:11 bmw e9x’s would love a chat
I just want to do a dirty tdi swap into my Cj-2a…….basically the Same thing….. right?
When did kevin smith get into cars?
You're not saving that engine. You're replacing it piece by piece because that thing is shot. Ill be impressed if that block isn't cracked or the cylinders are gouged beyond saving.
MK4 Jetta Estate TDI 5speed with nearly 1m miles here. Have owned many MK3's also.
I remember seeing you and the rest of the donut crew all cramp up in the golf at the hoonigan event with the other VW….beautiful car and I was excited to see you there
Got myself a Golf R 2 weeks ago. So glad this video dropped
Mark 4 R32, daily driver with 200k. Im 50, and was in the car scene in the 90s...you know, before a Honda ever ran a 13 in the quarter mile! Ty Tony. The East coast well represented the VWs, but we still had a small scene in the Bay Area. New Dimensions in Santa Clara, street races on Brotherhood blvd in SF. SHOUT OUT to Tomas Sport Tuning in Berkeley,  they are the LAST grassroots VW/Audi specialists and enthusiasts.  Thanks Tim and Ken they are the bros..
I have a 2011 5.0 and a 2009 Gti and i was considering selling the golf but then this video popped up thank you James
Used to have a 2.5 Rabbit before I got my Golf R, still miss the sounds I got outta that thing. I still have a cold start video on my channel that's sooo buttery...
Is it possible @robby_layton could repair that on YouTube for all of us to see...
Hey, I'm watching this video over a NordVPN connection!
I respect you, but I can't forgive vw for the emissions scandal. Germans just can't stop won't stop doing evil $hit
Hyped to see this rebuild. Love VWs
Square hella lights with the amber covers
another quality used car market manipulation propaganda video XD
I actually just saw one of these on marketplace today like 2 hours from me and it's tempting
Ist car was an 85 gti with auto tech goodies, 286 cam. 421 lift. 8 valve  What a lil thumper
Pumph! Happy for ya!
Leaving Donut was a mistake for all of you
I enjoyed my experience with a Golf, when I rented one for a week.
NUSPEED!
Awww VWVortex 😢 I was JimothyCricket. Miss those days! Love the vid James, so nice to reminisce.
I miss my mk3 jetta.
Once a dub head !............     Allways a dub head!
MK3 is where I started too…still have mine. Vortex were also my beginnings. Keep it real James
I was kiiiiiiiinda hoping for a "might as well" lol
Yessss content I’ve been waiting for ! I have a white mk3 gti aba turbo myself that I’m doing some rust repair on. I’ve been reading pvw magazines since i was a kid, a feature will always be a dream of mine. Can’t wait to follow along with this series.
Vw is garbage. Fight me bro. 😂
LFG!
sorry james i got a speed3 already
So glad your Golf isn't toasted, James! Glad to see it return 😮
Yo! I swear I'll get one if you guys help me lol
I'm very lucky my mom let me get my rabbit gti as my first car in 2016. She told me later that she had a Mk1 as her first car. It's still my baby to this day, I posted it in your discord. I hope to meet you someday at an event if my work schedule allows me to get to some this year.
I love my old gen 2 dodge but parked next to it are 3 VWs ive owned 10 plus and always will
GET THIS MAN TO WOOKIES IN THE WOODS
It would be cool if James did an updated Rinspeed Aliporta with his Golf project
Real “cool car” until you get into an accident your survival rate is probably 5%
I'm glad to see you getting into your car passion Pumphs!! Looking forward to more Golf build vids! 🤙🏻😎
Owned several MKI's and a MKV Rabbit. Wanted to boost that 2.5 and gap everyone.  Was in a South FL VW Club. SFLMKV, and VolksAudi out of MIA/FLL. And an old Vortex head. Glad to see some vw content!  Those vortex finds got me in the feels. sooo many parts and help gotten there!
Just bought me an 06 Golf this yr.
My first car was Gti, Second was a jetta wagon, great cars.
I truly miss the Vortex, and the knowledge I learned from it
Stoked to see this! I have a mk2 gti project right now. It was my car years ago that i sold and through a twist of fate it came back more than a decade later.
James convinced me to lowball 3 mk6 gti's on facebook marketplace. We're so back.
Car is named car because of french "carre".
i own a mk4 golf and love it 290000ml
Lower it😂
I have a love hate relationship with VW. I've always hated working on them, but every now and then there's something that's way easier than another vehicle or makes life better. I still believe the bad outweighs the good, but I recognize they aren't as bad as I've believed them to be.   Then I met the girl who would become my wife. She had/has a VW rabbit. Learning her car story and how every car before the VW let her down opened my mind a bit. Well, we're nearing the end of life for the rabbit (hopefully in March) and I've become slightly melancholy about it. It needs to go away. It's more rust than car and it has more issues than the entire thing is worth, but damn if it didn't give it's all to get this woman into my life. I've put her in my much newer more reliable vehicle when she needs to go out and have taken over driving the VW and it's been good to me as long as I'm considerate of it's issues. Hell, my first Christmas present to her was a remote start for it that I installed!   Im happy your VW is back and I'm down for the ride!
I had a MK4 R32 in college. Best car ever made imo lol
Me first car was a mark 3 now I own e30’s
HA NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
VW content, I’m hooked.
WAIT YOU LISTEN TO MEDIUM BUILD??? I knew you were cool, but that’s huge!
This reallly makes me miss my Mk3 GTI (with the awe inspiring 115 hp 2.0 ). Thanks for the trip down memory lane.
the mk1 rabbit was the fastest car ive ever been to date! 248 kmh. that was over 15 years ago! i still want one!
mk1 golf and mkII Gold and Jetta is my favorite
Ah two legends back together!!! Build her better brother!!!
Just bought a mk4 golf and love it !
Bring the golf out to alpine vag fair in Helen one of the best vw shows in America
Mo Golf Content Baybayyyyy
Bro is more loved by the car community than cars 😂 700k views in 10hrs?!?
I've owned 2 mk3 and 1 mk4 Jetta vr6... I really need to get a GTI with a vr6, I love that engine so much
Epic content! I dont know what it is, but vw's have never done it for me. The scene and everything is amazing, but I've never seen a modern vw and thought that's sick!
DANK!! If ya'll need help with your DIESELS, I gotchu :) peep my how-to'S
I also love the Volkswagen Golf, and my taste of that culture around it was Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition on the PS2. Can't see them without hearing the band Unwritten Law in my head.
Old school cool.
"Volkswagen. Das auto."
Rn im doing a 2000 VR6 Jetta project car hoping im able to boost it so far its been a year
Are you in your jay leno phase of dressing?
What happened to this guy? It's like his soul was sucked out of him. Remember him being overly exuberant all the time, now it's like a deflated version of him and the channel
VW community is the best!
17:38 YW!
I feel like I met you 15 years ago at a Krispy Kreme (Gardena) meetup from VW Vortex hahaha  I drove a tornado red 2.9l Corrado and my friend Louie had a Rabbit and bunch of other friends with mk2 vws
"I got my car back from  the company I used to work for" should never be uttered. When the car is in your name
Sorry Donut boys, I'm on Speeed now
I don't comment much... but this video warrants it... THIS is the type of content I was hoping for from this channel.
I became a fan of yours because you're a vdub bro. Happy to see this happening. Excited to see what you do. Now I need another old vw
I owned a Mk3 Golf 5-Speed in college; One of the most fun cars I have ever owned. It was quick and handled amazing in the winter. It got me through college with no major repairs and even drove me to my first career. I met my GF in college because she had a Blue Lagoon Metallic GLI Jetta and we struck up a conversation at a gas station. I remember walking out to the drive way with my Indian Red Golf and her Blue Lagoon Metallic Jetta and just stopping and staring at the combo before I would head to class. I sold it to a kid who wanted to track it. Thank you Speeed for the great memory recall.
You can get a running MK1 Focus for like 2-3k in pretty decent condition... Plus a 2.0T or a 2.5 duratech/mzp can be had for cheap. And there's always a V8-RWD conversion kit for em too. Don't know how things stack up once you get to mods, but just another overlooked platform.
I miss my Corrado G60! Best car ever without a V8
This is the third thumbnail now for this video. You really suck at this.
I almost stopped watching after you said the golf is the best bang for your buck…. Honda civic has entered the chat….
I have a mk4 gti with the vr6, may be the most hated gen but my god is it fun. on coils from ecs, resonator delete, and the super rare 2-door roofracks. God i love it.
Well it's not gonna be the best budget build after YOU said that it is😂
I have owned 3 mk3 vw's.  96 gti vr6, 93 golf TD and 94 golf GL (Automatic). The 94 was by far the worst one, something was always breaking on it.
Dude came alive once he left Donut. Keep it up.
i daily drive a mk6 jetta with the 07k its my favourite engine ever. it may be kinda slow but holy does it ever sound great
PUT A VR6 3,6L IN IT
Sick!
Man I wish you and big time would come together. Would be like the OG’s again and build yalls channel better than the other one. Won’t mention the name
i have a yellow golf with silver rims they rip bro in the touge ( i own it in midnight racing tokyo)
Replicated from JP ? Jps VW MK3 had nothing to do with ab simple Golf 3 !
I hope this guy is doing alright health wise . He just seems ….different
James needs to get himself a 190e next 😉
More powwa baby!! 🐎
I love my 6 sped MK7 R.
that's the Rockville Classic Car Show @3:28! right by my house in MD every September
first car i bought myself was a turbo jetta wagon, it was way too fast and drove like sh** for a 19  year old who had their license for less then a year, I loved it.
The tech really looks and talk like the guy with the funny TikToks
8:03 you can tell by the look on his face how that swap is going lol been there
Also some state require you to prove your age to visit certain websites, with NordVPN it can help you access them with out needing to verify your age 😉
I'm rocking the 92 corrado vr6 and mk7 gti :)
less talk more wrench
You should do as zach did back when you were on donut and come to brazil to see the car scene here. We are crazy about vw's, but our most popular here is the "gol", without the F. We tune the small AP engine like crazy here
Gonna need a “might as well “ shirt
Ok now I’m invested. I’ve always wanted a Jetta with no butt. This build is gonna be sick
HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHUEGHHUEGH I have my 2.5 inline 5 B7 Puh sat and I am ESTATIC to see that muh engine Ive been maintaining has some pedigreeeeeeeee
After watching I still want a corvette… 😆
James. Respect. You are one hustlin mofo. Thanks.
Once again trying to drive up the used car market 😊
wait was this the fat guy from donut?
I find it hard to believe that a VW scene exists/existed.
Uhhh, show us the Gwagon please!
638,000 views  10 hours ago nice
I would just like to note I have a 2007 MkV, one owner, just at 100K, non-GTI 5 cylinder and I am moving out of state and I can't take it with me. Probably not the worst deal you could find if you're looking...
3:46 is he talking about andrew tate? 😂
So 20 min of babbling and Nothing happened.
Making me want another mk4 vr6 🥲
I wish I can sub you some money. You’ve been awesome. Been watching you for a long time. I’m happy you’re back and I’m happy that you’re doing well.
James is so pure
i got a fiat can we still hang out?
Who is the bald red guy
Love my Mark 7 gti, just working to pay it off to then mod it
Older VW head here... I grew up driving in early watercooled VWs. First car was a '78 Diesel Rabbit L . I still have the '86 GTI my Dad bought brand new in the garage, it has a 2.0L bottom end and that's about as MKIII I've ever gone. I also still have all of those PVW mags you showed in the video. I was all over Vortex from late '90s on and used to comb the junkyard for parts in the early 2000s here in NorCal. I'm happy you got your car back and stoked to watch the build.
James!! I'm currently working on restoring a Harlequin and missed this car so much!! Jealous of the cup mirrors by the way!
I’ve had 3 Golfs (I’m 21). I had a big turbo mk6 GTI, tuned mk7.5 GTI, and a manual 7.5 Golf R. The amount of people I’ve met, connections I’ve created, events I’ve attended is insane. By far the best community in the car scene, and it’s not even close. Everyone is knowledgeable, kind, and supportive. No egos, no bad blood, nothing. The VW community is amazing
As a mk3 owner I also support the idea everyone should buy one.
Your build is gonna be awesome!
Enjoyed you on donut. Wasnt really huge on some of your new content since starting your own channel but i threw my subscribe in. But now we're talking a car project. We're back baby! Can't wait to see where this thing ends up! I've always been tempted to do a golf project myself but i love my Aussie cars too much.  Recently drove a cupra ateca rental (correct me if I'm wrong its golf running gear). I loved every second of it.
I like we share the same last name with the shop 🤣🤣
I know why but it woulda been cool To see James go on that donut v dub trip in Germany
This video makes me feel better that my project $1700 mk5 gti has now become a $3500 gti and keeps growning 🤣
I’m pretty sure you’re good people.
I miss my mk4 Jetta :( Met a lot of awesome dudes on VWVortex back in the day. Even drove from Southern Delaware to Staten Island to buy a set a seats from a guy on there. Great memories
I'm excited about a Youtuber doing something that is as a premise 'attainable' - very much sick of, "I straight piped my Ferrari or I re-built a crashed GT3".... Love you James
Had a mk3 vr6 and I miss that car so much .
Yeah imma stick with honda ….
The amount of blow by was kinda funny dancing that oil cap the way it did.
This is just padded out, ad laden rubbish.
bit off topic but JAMES you are looking GOOD!!
Mk3> over all of it
VW Community is awesome!!!!
Found jamie orr a long time ago before i was able to buy my vw. Now it’s all i prefer. This will get lost but thanks Jaime! Also ur atlas R at wolfsgart a few years back was cool
You convinced me before I even watched the video. Fb marketplace here I come
Severe Painful nostalgia for H2Oi and doing vw stuff with my friends 😢
I know people get attached to their cars but why Volkswagen I've never seen one that has any reliability behind it cancel the calling in the house market buying money peds you think you're getting a good deal but you're getting somebody else's problems
Glad I got my Mk6 when I did lol Have had it for 2 years and driven well over 60k miles up and down California. Sold my old POS 335i and never looked back.
Pumps is doing okay everybody..........rolling to the shop in a G-Wagon!  Come'on bro,  stop playing the poor boy.  My guess is,  Donut had to pay him out some serious cheddar from doing him dirty.
Itm SO excited to watch this series
I'm so stoked for this.  PVW and vwvortex got me into cars, and the first car I really loved was a mk3 Jetta.  I drove that thing to Montana and all over.
yasss car video!!
Thank you for this video. It hit on so many levels. As a fellow Mk3 nerd, I salute you. 🫡 #vwvortex forever ❤ ps its pkstrategy
This makes me miss my mk5 rabbit.  9 years together we had
God I miss H20i
US Military brat here. Born in Stuttgart Germany, lived in kitzagen for 7 years. 1st car 83 Saab 900 S Turbo. Currently own 2013 jetta sport wagon TDI , 2005 Beetle 1.8 TDI, 2015 F250 big block diesal. The only reason i buy gasoline is for the lawnmower. ✌️😎
I was thinking about getting a golf,WRX or mini cooper as a first car and that’ll be a rally type project for the dirt roads where I live
Is that a g wagon?
I had to sell my mk4 golf with a jeta front end to fix my truck :/ i been looking at market place to see if its up for sale again i want to buy it back so bad
My first car was an 04 Passat with a 1.8t and I loved it. To this day I miss it and regret getting rid of it. Happy to see this VW again! 🎉
Yeah I was afraid of when you were going to make this video 😭 the 07K market is gonna go crazy
Can’t wait
10:05 the way he started talking like a toddler after you ask a question they weren’t expecting 😂
Just got rid of my golf but still have my 1999 cabrio that I daily
I've always loved my Jetta, but my heart sings thinking about my Golf with a butt <3
Love this! I'm currently working on swapping the VR6 from my old golf into a Vento (mk3 jetta)
From the old Vortex days - LOWER IT.
I'm with you James, VW golfs are sick! I have a Mk7 GTI that I just hit 238,000 miles (the distance to the moon!) on and I still can't wait to drive it everyday! And my wife drives a TDI SportWagen, also sick! Can't wait to see what you do with it. And extra love from a fellow March 19th birthday boy!
we love you!!! i like that y'all just let a blown engine run like you did. that's real mechanic stuff.
Finally ❤❤❤❤
The best engine on any vw is the 1.9 tdi tune and deleted things gonna rip roll coal and still give you 50mpg
How is it rusty i thought it only stayed in cali
MK3s are destined to rust and return to the Earth. Clean MK3s are expensive now.
Have an 89 Mexico mk1 cabriolet, dual round clipper kit. Come be my friend
wish he could make it out to the OFF ROAD GAMES again!
this was sucha good freaking video
To me the Golf is the OG Hot Hatch
i drive a pontiac vibe
Best tuner platform???? No way
PUT THAT ON GARM
You still got the e30?
VWVortex was great. I miss my MKIII. I had a Jetta 2.0 8v. I miss that car every day.
Spike's Car Radio plays yesterday and this shows up in my YouTube the next day.
The fact I saw my username “BadasslilGti” as soon as you scrolled VWVORTEX made my night lol. I just literally said to my girl as we were watching I was on that site nonstop back then. Thank you for bringing back that nostalgia feeling w this video 🫡
Its the modern version of the Crusher Camaro
Is he not at donut any more?
I just guessing the lowrider / hotrod scenes ain’t do none of the body mods that the VW’s crowd did.
i love my mk4
hell yeah brother!
B5 needs more attention, I will die on my hill. Also love my mk4 jetta
Coool hat bro!   Are you going to become the prophet of the triple vowel? Some friends of mine here in Tokyo have a band called the Goood Things. They formed in the early 2010’s and recently started playing again after Covid and babies. Saw them last weekend. Good vibes. They’ve got a song called “The Looong Way” you can find on Youtube or Spotify.
He pumps the discord and seems like a big kid looking for friends... which you are.
lol @ taking back sunday
My friend’s older brother had a 99 Jetta in the mid 00’s and it was loud, low had completely illegal tint that I vividly remember him taking a hair dryer to the tint in the driveway after getting a ticket for it being so dark
im sorry but that isnt a good looking car. i will say though, i do much prefer it over newer vehicle designs
its awesome seeing this considering I bought a 2012 golf with the 07k about two years ago and last week I picked up a 2015 gti, drive and love them both immensely lol
I find vws are like a drug, once you get one you can’t get enough 😂  I’m 21 and I’ve owed 7 vws already💀  (1 mk2, 2 mk3s, 2 mk4s, and one b5 Passat) and currently have 4… what can I say they are lovable cars😂 and cheap to get into
Picked up my 5th Mk4 recently. Lots of maintenance to do on it, hoping to make a fun track car
"Dudebro, you got a VR in there, dudebud?"
All yalls Vw Audi bmw and Porsche projects need Black Forest industries shift knobs! Amazing hand feel and color match appearance options!
That just looks like typical NYC Snow rust
i really like the calm and normal speaking pumphrey
Great video man content is dope…. You seem like a genuine guy …one of my favorite car guys on YT…subscribe 💪🏿
VW Vortex has helped me out of quite a few questionable situations. Lord knows MK6 GTIs have numerous issues. Currently trying to figure out why my drivers side door will not open from the outside, so if anyone has any updates 😬.
Just don't. They are junk and will break all the time and be prepared to give all you money to the mechanic if you get this
Everything is completely opposite in EU
I have 100s of 20 year old EuroTuner magazines featuring the best euros and VWs that are still relevant today! That was a great mag back in the day
I've got a NON color matched Hella Dual Round MkIII AAA VR6 GTI with a phantom coolant leak that I haven't been able to figure out. There's 262s, intake, stainless downpipe, steel brake lines, MkIV shift tower swap (because it bolts up, but doesn't fit perfectly in the cabin), rebuilt the interior, rewired most of the dash, and I've lost my passion because of a phantom coolant leak and phantom battery drain.   I gave up three weeks ago.  Edit: Watched this whole video and you don't even have a VR6?! I'm not happy about this video, and sad that I typed this AAA VR6 Life comment.
I wanna find a mk3-4 jetta with the 1.9tdi my favorite car.
This is the best thing that could of happened. James P + MkIII Content
James!! Love the Medium Build hat!!
perfect car for a bigtimeee collab
I remember VW as the car that raced for pinks in Fast and Furious, then lost, and ran away.
Thanks for releasing this, making the resale price of my car go up😂
My golf project was more of a golf problem haha
If I had the motivation to start a youtube channel it would be exactly like yours, love ya Pump! great work!
I drove a rental golf in Georgia several years ago. Thing was a little ripper. Loved the turbo lag.
I always laugh when California car guys talk about rust, living in New England. I feel for James here... the car is actually rusty
Oh man my old MKIII GTI. I miss it, would love to re-visit, but the bad mountain roads 'round here are hard on non-truck like suspensions. Need that rally lift!  Honestly I hate little cars. After driving the GTI through  some winding roads. O_O Very fun little car!  Number 5 is the winner brother! I have been trying to get everyone to buy a 4x4  Shout out to HumbleMechanic - the "while I'm in here" video
keep up the good work buddy, we are all rooting for you.
Love you James, can’t wait to see what you have in store for the Golf! 🚙💨🖤🖤
for my first car i was looking to get a MK3 golf before my BMW E46 kinda found me and fell into my lap.
Making the Scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhTXPj47QJM
Does James have a G wagen as a daily?
I got a Mk2 golf.  Can I hang?
Wait not yet. I’m trying to get a mk4 r32.
That amount of rust in a Golf in Australia would condemn it to scrap.
I think we're about the same age, I was in VA not KY but man this is like a blast into my teens and twenties again. Haven't looked at the vortex or a performance vw mag in a long time. It was quite an era.
TTTTrrrrraaaaaassssshhhhhhhhhhhh. That's what you are. Should never have had a platform to yell at anybody from in the first place. You're the Theo Von of the motorsports world.
In 2010 I met my entire friend group through vwvortex and the Maine VW scene. Vegasjetta from vortex is one of my longest running friendships. He happened to live in my town. VW's will always have a place in my heart. ❤
Marketplace immediately starts trying to sell me rusted out 90's jettas 😂
Pshhh mk1 focus would run rings around a mk3 G
My first car was a first gen Scion xB, at that time the best xB's in america were built by guys who came form the VW scene.  They 1000% built the xB's the way VW's were being built and that inspired me so much as I built mine.  I was always on VW Vortex looking for inspiration to build my not-VW car haha.  The VW guys definitely had the perfect fitment on lock before the the japanese car scene caught on to it.
I was a massive part of the vag scene in 02-08 I worked at sleepers performance and did a lot of dubaudi gruppe cars. Hows that for name for a throwback
This is gonna be lit!!
europeans already know that the Golf is a bang for your buck, because we see and hear them all the time EVERYWHERE
your the reason i bought a golf mk7 R been a 2 years now with 0 regret best car i ever own and that coming from a guy that only bought honda in the pass
BRING back VWVortex!!!!
I just got a 2000 VW Jetta tdi 5 speed I have no idea what I should do with it any ideas
Oh no mk3 and mk4s are about to sky rocket
Working on a 87 16v GTI Resto, loving your content
I saw an 80's convertible rabbit and thought it would be a sick project car, but i had no money at the time, but it's on my list for sure.
Love the wallaby’s
You could say the same about a focus ST
You love Volkswagens. We love Volkswagens. We should be friends! But seriously, let us know if we can ever help with anything! We would love to! ♥
0:52 I gotta stop you there, there's not a snowballs chance in hell I'm ever owning a golf. I'll watch though! Ya'll have fun
When are you going to get rid of that Donut tattoo?  🍩
Yeahhh!!
This is the best news I've heard in a minute. Even in a bad situation, there's still a silver-lining. God-Speeed, my friend. 😇
I have a 1996 Mk3 Golf GTI VR6 project car and I'll be your friend!
Funny my first car was a 1989 240sx with a KA24E, thought it was fast, raced a Honda prelude. Got spanked, sold it, then purchased a 1998 GTI VR6, after that there was no turning back.
ad ends at 16:12
I have a mk4 jetta project, is that close enough?n.
Dude you nailed this.
My 01 Jetta Wolfsburg 1.8T 5MT was the most dynamic, engaging and stable FWD car I've owned. And I've owned some fun stuff!
What truck are you driving?
h20i was this shit i miss it
I like the mic and name changes on it but love donut and you I got I scion xb (my tool box on wheels wish I could get a handle made to put on top lol you guys made me feel welcomed even tho my cars about out the window I've tryed to keep her around I just really wish she would stay around and I love vw's so much but I hope my girl stays around but it's what it is wish I could do more with her but taking care of my mom my sister and my nec I'm stuck and not seconds or threed I'm fourth I try so hard to make everyone else happy but me
i had an 09 jetta with the 2.5 and a mk7 gti after that. love the VW scene, keep it up James!
Jimmy oaks, bhall and grit flanderson.
Wait until you start looking for oem parts and everything is NLA
Really hoping the Mid and Early 2000s VW scene makes a comeback, there're some wild engines, cool combinations and upgrades across VAG you can use. Even some Passat's are fun, R36's for sure but hell even 2.0TDI's chipped and slightly built will pull like a train
James! I love you but you could never convince me to buy a junker VW.
Castro needs a YouTube channel
If your predictions make prices go up, that would be a….  Speeed bump.
Did Donut keep “Mo Powah!!”? I want to keep watching them too but if they were that petty…then nah
Checked out donut after this video.  Was in early on donut. Its like they bought generic versions of the orignals, it was verrrry odd.
James I don’t need another car!!!! I’ve been looking at a Golf for months but I don’t need it……………. I NEED IT!!!!
I miss h2o so so so much
Clio 2 sedan
Currently fixing up a 96 Cabrio. 🤘🏽
this is huge for the program
I’ve had a mk6 GLI for 10 yrs now, and it still puts a smile on my face. VWs just have something about them that make them great. I’ve loved them my entire life. Old man had 2 mk2 Jettas; first car was one of those Jettas, and VWs steering and handling is world class.
Nah, I want an Omni.
My first manual was a mk3 gti I miss it, might get one again 🏎👍🏾😎
As a dude almost 40, I remember exactly what you are talking about with VW and Golfs being cool back in the day(still cool if you ask me). I have wanted one forever especially a Golf R. Some day maybe I can get one or build one. Pumped for this.
U got me missing my mk3 gti vr6
I love my mrk4 jetta
A friend of mine got DRILLED by a Volkswagen Corrado when crossing the street one night. Flew up in the air, lost his shoes, ambulance and police on the scene; it was a mess. Afterward his prom date ghosted him because he was all crutched and bandaged up. Hard times for my buddy. Anyway, I want a Corrado so bad, but apparently he has a little "trauma" from the event, and "isn't a fan"  of the car for some reason. But for real, I feel he'd be like "WTF bro; why are you doing this to me?".
when i was younger, probably like 8 or 9, my aunt was dating this guy who drove a vw rabbit. i thought it was the coolest car ever. he would always show me his new trophies he would win at car shows and stuff. he was one of the first, at least he said, to have a VCR in his trunk and a in dash. he always had half baked playing. i still think about him and wonder how hes doing. hes probably in his 40s now.
Dude, I'm so stoked that your channel blew up so fast. I bet the VC vultures are already circling.
is it me or the mic quality isnt as good as it could be?
@6:25 😂😂😂
Mk2 and mk1 for me.
AWWsome 😎
Don't forget "Volkswagen" means "people's car" and their slogen is "Volkswagen - THE car"  The idea in the beginning was, that it's a car everyone would be able to afford... it's not quite like that anymore 😅
Volkswagens rule . FAHRVERGNUGEN!!!
My first car was an 81 vw rabbit that was near perfect. got t-boned and sold it to a guy in Peru where it is very happy and repaired now. Finally bought an 81 vw caddy and I've been working on replacing all the consumable pieces. Super excited to get it nice again. It's pretty rough.  Also, when i was 16, I thought I was so cool and unique for thinking of an audi tt swap and maybe even an awd system as my dream build. I'm kinda happy other people are doing it so it'll be much easier to do in the future.
12k into my mk5 Jetta TDI now 😅
When can we expect the Scotto crossover for the VW project?
Bro @8:04 was going througghhhh it.
07k swap?
awesome video. i love that you're excited about the car.   Dont need to convince be to by a golf. i have had more the 10 mk3 VR6 gti's in the past. Ive had 4 corrados and a MK4 R32. Also had a mk3 jetta 1.8T syncro awd and Golf wagon tdi syncro. . also a bunch of mk2 gti's.  Currently building a mK3 vr6 turbo 4motion . and a mk2 3.2 vr6. Daily driving a another mk3 vr6 and also have another MK2 Vr6 syncro project. This one was the worlds first mk2 vr6 mated to a syncro system. featured in European car in 1995.    wait there is more. I have a Supercharged vr6 corrado another mk2 vr6 getting a 3.6l vr6 and MK8 golf r.     I might like vw's a bit to much.
My wife is going to be so mad.
I agree with this message
Funny when he says old VWs, brain automatically goes to Type 1s.😂
Video effective. I want one
"Replicated" is a stretch when you show a ground-up tube chassis, rear engined V10 swapped golf who's only inspiration from you is the teal color. Glad you got it back but keep your ego in your pants man, lmao
Golf’s     I have 12 in total   I need more and my whole family hates it, so I bought my parents a golf each lol
Yawn 🥱 get a real car. Trying to sell a used car that breaks down and is old
I HATE that you are probably right about these being the best bang for buck project at the moment. Don't get me wrong - one of my favorite cars was my 2001 VW beetle TDI - which was a gold with a bubble.   It's just that I want a Miata, but they have gotten too expensive.  I REALLLY want a Miata.  But I do like these ..
as someone big in the diesel truck scene rn u really just put in perspective how car scenes come and go, one day the thing that takes up much of my life will be a memory and i just think thats really interesting. Great video James!!!!
I'll always be salty because I sold my bagged CC while this was for sale back in the day. I had my 83 GTI at the time and was trying to buy this car...and was SOOOO SALTY when I saw this pop up on Dougnut when I had the truck and trailer  ready to go buy it when it sold
I got 4 words for you James: HELLA COLOR DESIGN TAILLIGHTS
Your music hits in my ear bud's but so far I just started watching your videos great content you are making vws great again, and make shirts
One of my earliest car modding memories was a modded Jetta back in the 2000's. I think Fast 4 just had came out, I was entering Middle school that year, I had just walked out the barbershop and I was walking over to the salon my moms was at. Then I saw it a Nissan GTR, but it wasn't, it was a mk3 Jetta, silver with blue stripes. Normally you would think someone would make a F&F Jesse tribute but nah, this psycho made his Jetta look like the R34 GTR from 2F2F. I like instantly thought it was goofy af but it opened my eyes, this thing had a lot of work done to it, body kit, custom paint, chrome wheels and he even made the taillights in the back a pair of double circles like an actual GTR. I thought it was lame but cool at the same time, I'll never forget it, and now I gotta see if I can find my DSi I used to take pictures of it. It was on Long Island if anybody else has seen it!
Wanna have some german license plates? Should be possible to send them.
James I’ve asked for years at donut to go over the rise and fall of h2oi in ocean city. It doesn’t need to be derogatory in any way just the history 😢
i swear you only make fire videos. nuthin but bangers💯
I have had 2 Golfs in my life (06 Rabbit 2.5l and an 15 1.8 TSI) and dammit if this video didn't make want another one. Really, really want another Rabbit. Thanks James!
are you smoking pounds of crack a day? the golf parts are some of the most expensive and hardest to get!!! the best deal for a project car is going to be one of the big three and probably ford  from 2000 to 2010 because they made a trillion of everything and they are all cheap as hell
i had a brand new 95 Golf III sport..it had every conceivable thing go wrong with it with thin the first 3 years..super fun when it was working, not super fun having to have roughly 5 major repairs in under 3 years, all drive train..all under warranty, but all sucked
after this video, this car will probably not be affordable anymore lmao
How did I not know you had an older G Wagon!?!?!?
I remember how absolutely massive the VW scene was growing up. I bought a 2.0 SOHC Golf with a 5-speed manual, Honestly it was the most enjoyable car i've ever owned for the ONLY reason that the community was AMAZING. I've never felt like I fit in at another car meet, bike meet, ect. I was always welcomed and instantly accepted by the groups in the VW clubs.
golf because family
Is it just me or did we all think that this guy owned Donut Media?
I see what you did there with "BlockedWebsites" lol great color scheme choice lol
I’m moms ‘14 beetle r-line is pretty much a gti and it’s is SOOO FUN
Edging me by not saying “family”
I’m all about the VW love. I have a MK1 in the garage. Been looking at the 07k a lot lately.
My first car almost 15 years ago was a Mk4 Jetta 1.8t. It's in my garage right now and I'm absolutely never selling it. It's made me so many good friends and memories, it's unreal. It also lays frame, which is frickin badass bro
Why is it so rusty?
Jetta: Golf with a butt Jetta Sportwagen: Extra Golf
That's bottom end knock. Can't wait for the forged internals. :P
So to hang with James I just gotta get vw? Bet 😂
Thankfully the MK3 and MK4 are really affordable in my country, maybe I’ll make a Golf project this year!
I am now on my 4th Golf and am so here for this!  I plan to eventually get a Mk3 VR6 or, if I can find one, an Corrado VR6.  Lovely cars.
Speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
HELLL YEAH VR6 SQUAD RAGGGHHH WOOKIE ENGINE!!!!!
Taking back Sunday 😀
2:01 just imagining this segment being yelled at you and it’s the closest thing we’ve gotten in a while to EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO GET UP TO SPEED ON THE VOLKSWAGEN GOLF!!!!
hard to find these in Australia
The Jetta is the quintessential cute or hit girls car in the 90’s.
I’m a former Honda master tech who has always gone between VW and Honda as far as car ownership.  My first car that I bought with my own money back in 1998 was a 5 speed MK2 GLI, then in 2013 I bought a 5 speed MK3 4 door Golf GL, and I currently drive a 6 speed MK6.5 GLI.  The first two were great little cars.  My current GLI is SUPER fun….when it’s all working.  Only has 80k on it and it CONSTANTLY breaks!!  It is tuned and all that jazz with a stage 2 clutch but good LORD if you look at it wrong, it ends up in the shop.  Still love it though!😂
Mini Truck scene is what I was involved with in the late 80s-90s.
My friend had one  his was red   inside was red and white interior and white wheels  he ended  wrecking it
How James feels about Golfs is exactly how I feel about Chevy's S10 Platform. From 1982-2005 only. GMT330s.
Yo James I have a 2.5L MK6 Jetta as my daily driver, I've been wanting to make it into my 1st project car for years which is how I started watching Donut, and Speeed.  Drop a link to that engine conversion pls&thx. This is gonna be sick
I got an 01 Jetta vr6 as a project with my dad
It would be better with more ads.  I only watch for the ads.
as a proud owner of a MK4 golf (wagon) project, the vw scene is underrated these days, these cars are so incredibly fun and cheap to own and work on
1:20  "👉🍁..... that's car." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
VW Vortex was life back in the day.  GTG's in KOP, Toys for Tots runs From Valley Forge to FDR. I still have my MKIV, 20+ years and counting. My girls love it, "can we go in the black car!!". The wifey, not so much. 😁
I regret selling my GTI every single day
Absolutely stoked for this! Sadly I just sold my Mk5 R32 as we have a baby on the way and had to buy a different car. So I look forward to living vicariously through the upcoming videos.
Should have got a civic!!
Dude, thanks for this. Favorite episode so far.
Did he forget about the civic? It’s been doing stuff for cheap since like 89,. Also the Miata is still doing all the cool stuff for cheap, and it has a proper drive train.
Lol I wish we had closer taste in cars. I'll stick with muscle cars and trucks, and you have a blast with these. I love to see it, I just couldn't own one
I'm 18, and I've had my mk5 gti since I was 15. It's such a fun car, and people don't even realize it!
cool. v cool
Trump is gonna deport that thing. Get the paperwork in order.
Love the vid and project.... but please.... show us the repair and modification process in every tiny detail! :D looking forward to it!
My dream car is a MKIII GTI with an Erebuni Wide Body Kit that I haven't seen in production since the mid 2000's
Not a golf but I got a mk 3 jetta GLX, vr6 w the 5 spd. Though I do prefer the golf, admittingly.
I miss my mk3 VR6
yep, this is what we always wanted. maybe less videos on pants
i have a 02 jetta tdi 186,000
too late, bought a beetle instead
"MIGHT AS WELL" t shirt when????????? thanks james
Love this! My first new car was a '96 GTI-VR6 in Bright Surf Green. Brings back a lot of great memories. Can't wait to see more!
Instructions unclear, got a mk4 jetta tdi
i love the VR6 engine, only way id be happy in a VW
I was a VWvortex mod.  It legit gave me street cred at VW meets and shows. so stupid when I think about it now.
Make a video about the mk1 Chevy Sprint
Im not a car guy I’m just getting into cars but what kind of cars are those red and black ones with the trunk open in castros shop? 19:32  If anyone knows 🙏🏽
I own a bmw. But I kinda like the idea of this. Would make a killer daily
Dude I'm hyped for this! I'm always looking for fun and different projects and seeing this video as put my eye on the 2.5. It's so interesting that its similar to the 2.5 used in the RS3. Thinking of all the fun projects that could be put together with such a modest powerplant has me hooked. Back to google I go. Thanks brother and keep up the good work. We are all in your corner.
Let’s talk about this G-Wagen you’re driving in the video… what is it? AMG?
Need it now brother!!! I need to see the outcome!! At least the motor being built.
Don’t forget about B4 Passats!!!
I’ve got a MK2 GTI and MK1 Scirocco project lol….but that’s why you have more then 1 VWs so when one breaks you still have another one to drive haha
My 1st car was a mk2 golf and it handled like it was on rails. Regret selling because 2 week after selling the buyer somehow wrote it off
I love this video!!! I just bought an MK6 Golf last week!!! The timing of this video is eerily precise. Keep up the amazing work!❤❤❤
I test drove two golfs a couple of years ago when I bought my current car. They were for sale at 12k. One was an automatic and the other a manual. The drive was nice but I didn't like the position of the steering wheel. They felt off center.
It needs a vr
Scirocco gang
I run BEW TDI at 29 psi trying to figure out how to put tracks on them. For reference I live 8 months of winter. Down to -50c
Those were the good days! Miss my mk3s. Sold my last VW 10 years ago but I did recently pick up a Passat wagon 3.6 that needed timing chains for cheap. Got it all up and running and man I missed having a vr6.
Out of the 14 volkswagens ive owned, i miss my mk3 drivers edition gti the most.  It had 282k on it when i sold it, the only thing that was not working on it at that time was the passenger seat would no longer recline.
I love my mk7 R, I loved my mk7 GTI, and I loved my mk6 GTI. My brother introduced me to VW with his mk4 GTI VR6 and then his mk4 Jetta wagon tdi. I’ve only ever owned VWs and I hope to keep it that way
Brilliant Editing, everything was mwah. Keep it up James 👊
Sweeeeeet Speeeeeed Babeeeeeeeeeee
Sweeeet -:)
Nahh man the golf's prices are gona blow up now
What a great fuckin' video. You are killing it, dude!
I already have a GTI stop making this more expensive 😢
awesome video and videos, finally you do what you do and nobody tells you other wise, freaking awesome videos James, since day 1 you went solo!
As a vw technician, can confirm. We're basically a cult...
Where the book club at?
Weight loss?
I’m a voltswagon hater but if you want to find all the golfs and jettas and bora’s and 🤮pasats please take them out of Ireland we are infested of them
21 minute video... didmt get the car to the place till 17 minutes in... OK
Bro just slept on the 2.0 16v abf and the 1.8t
get a mini ferrari engine in that VW it would be insane
It's for the Commuinity guys!
My brother who's 46 now was really into jettas and golfs when I was growing up in the 00s. He had a mk2 golf and a mk3 jetta as well as a mk3 golf. Never knew why he loved them so much but I have fond memories of listening to ODB in a grey bucket seat. One of them was black and had red trim on the grill. I thought it was really cool and was a big part of why I like boxy older cars nowadays. Modern cars to me at least don't have much of a soul
Pumps  is trying to inflate the market and sell! The ole pump and dump!
we can hang out!!!!!
thats the Eurowise work
Civic>golf
My aspirations are being reborn as we speak
Donut to dope 😂
Is that an Element you are driving??😅
Today I learned my MK5 Rabbit 2.5 is cool:)
NordVPN is a major W
Bros been on that Jenny crank diet!
Don’t have a golf but I do have a 93 5speeed manual corrado
VW Golf 3, the worst of all 🤣
My 2015 MK7 GTI, got it in 2020 with 61k miles,  hybrid turbo making 400whp still have it with 133k miles now Those GTIs are best bang for your buck hands down 🫰🏾
I grew up on porsches and bmw's, I have had the same porsche for 18+ years, I've now gotten into benz, don't get me wrong the old school VW golfs and jettas are cool in their own way. But everyone else can have the vw's
This was a emotional episode just sold my jetta mk3. 😢
I need a daily before a project car I need a daily before a project car I need a daily before a project car I need a daily before a project car I need a daily before a project car I need a daily before a project car.......... Im boutta buy one of these things.
Great now Mk3 will sell for 4k😢 keep VW cheap
Nah Bro I was out in Palmdale at LACR since 1990! JDM was getting it in!
James. Help I have 5 golf projects  you're validating my problems
i think il go on girls like vw's😂😂🇵🇭
Hey James you look skinnier have u lost weight?
“Buy a VW” translates to “misery love company”
We are so back
Medium Build!
EDIT: I would like to know what shade of blue your car's paint is. I deleted and rewrote my comment because people thought I was a bot.
part of me misses my mk3 glx but i dont miss the random electrical issues
I  got a b2 Passat TD, no i. Can I be in the club??!!
What happened to his AE86?
What a great time to be 1k into a mk6 golf 2.5
🩵
I am far from a VW fan, but your probably right about choosing one to hop up today
Yooooooo bro reach out to Mike mohn from the old Volkswagens forums He's sitting on one hell of a Volkswagen project
Love your content. Im on my second Gti cornflower blue this time!
Dude is an amazing storyteller
<======= GTI BABY....I remember when VW Vortex morphed from  "THE SAMBA"
Recently got a Mk5. needed a lot of work but there's plenty of tutorials on the car & the mk6 is really similar. The car was very cheap and it came with a ton of mods. It's been fun fixing everything myself. Wasn't hard to learn either! def worth it.
The seamless Nord VPN ad is an art within itself.
Honda Civic best bang for buk far as I'm concerned.
I know the "where I'm at" ❤
My daily driver is a Jetta, inline 5.  I love it
Keep up the great work James! 🎉
Im pretty sure the best bang for your buck project car is a ford falcon AU/BA or a holden commodore.
Watching this as I’m trying to flip a MK4 VR6 🤑🤑 Fr tho love VW’S and wouldn’t sell it if I didn’t have to. Got it 1 owner with window sticker for 1700 2 months ago
Don’t give a shit about golfs but I’m hyped for this build just cuz of your personality
Bruh... now the price is gonna double on shitbox MKiii's. Thye just came back to reality like 6 months ago.
Just bought two
Bah.  Dangerous cars are good.  They make you stronger!
im excited to finally see this golf getting the fixing it deserves
I got my first project its a Honda accord 1992 hatchback
Forget Crypto, we're Pump and Dumping crusty VWs on Marketplace!!
This is lowkey a huge flex for VW owners
I like how simple the car looks. No extreme cosmetic upgrades. Classy
i love vw personally i like the sedans
The cars are back baby! Moh powa!
the sad part is th at noone from europe finds a golf cool :( me too. golf sucks and are boring
good luck brother!
Do you have AIDS
No, I had an Audi S5 and it was the biggest money pit.
h e l l y e a h
ill say this the car is badass as a car and everything except golfs are gay might as well start electric swapping only way you might make them relevent again 🤷🏿‍♂️
You genuinely got off with the best of the worst on this, if that engine didn't start it would really suck.
944 MEANTIONED LETS GOOOOO
But.... what about Passats? Are they invited to the cool VW club?
I learned how to drive stick on a mk3 diesel. It made it to 650k before giving up, legendary.
cutting to the car shut off at 21:30  and the shop being filled with smoke is kind of funny😂
everyone that asks what kind of car they should get for under 10k i say GLI
The video that we were all waiting on and what this channel needed to grow further 👍🙏
Just picked up a mk5 Jetta with the 07k in it for 2500$ so exited
I don't know man every old vw has shit tons of electrical iasues
EA888 FTW!!!!!!
Can you buy a '01-'03 eurovan next and make a video, please? Asking for a friend.
That 2.5l i5 is awesome. Everything else on your VW will break or wear out, but the engine will NOT die
Got a 2007 volkswagen gti for sale needs a key fob and compressor 2500 obo
7:11 Toyota
This gonna be sweeet! You guys know the brazilian Golf 4 and a half? Weird lil guy.. Also, chill James is much nicer than shouty James. Cheers, dudes!
The flood of memories that I got from this video. I grew up with a Mk3, then bought it from my parents, and modified it thru my 16-26 age. The problems with rust on the gen 3s is insane. Broke my heart truly. So much so that, my new hatch (fiestaST) is getting washed every week and will never see winter. Looking forward to updates to this project 🙌
I had a 97 gl 5 speed I miss that thang used to pull to even being just a 2.0
I had a 25th anniversary MK4 GTI, one of my most beautiful cars.! <3
I fell in love with VW when I had started working with my Dad on his 84 VW rabbit GTI, To this day I still love the 5speed gear box those cars had with the 1.8 N/A, it doesn't matter if any one thinks its slow, its my car not yours so get over it.
I absolutely love my 07 rabbit.
I LOVE THE CAR CONTENT HELL YES
Love the format of this video. Feels personal and connected to the culture. I've never been a Golf guy but the nostalgia of old car magazines and early youtube videos of car shows and racing taken on camcorders really hits the spot.
I love the Excitement at the end. this is channel really is awesome
god i love hatchbacks , id rip a golf for sure
Damn James dropped a lot of weight and is looking good
I am very excited for this! I daily drive a b5 passat wagon with the 2.8l v6. I love VWs!  I used to be on the vw vortex forums as well, when i had a 1983 vw rabbit gti.
I love the list aspect of the video. The Chicken soup of youtube.
My mk3 is my shit box race car. It's a 12v vr6, with big choppy cams and a 3 inch exhaust for basically no reason. It kept up with my buddy's e36 m3 on highway pulls, and handles great, despite what the Internet tells you about vr6 cars. I love it, but mine needs work too.
The thing is....  I don't like things in my butt.   And no I don't play golf
Damn 500 hp in a golf 3 isn’t just a dream in Europe, it’s super duper illegal and where I live they’ll confiscate the car
Speeed casually inflating the gold m3 😂 fr great video as always!
1.9 tdi pd swap it
"the engine is only $500"   Was ... The more people talk about them openly, the more hype they get, the less there will be, the more they will cost. That's literally what happened with 2jz's, Rbs, etc. When 'popular' people talk about them and praise them, openly, people go after those cars/engines. MAINLY to resell at a higher price, sometimes, to actually use.
Ohh i love this. I have 5 mk3:s ❤
You should watch Garbage he ran this engine on eggnog n it still wouldn't die
Heck yeah brother! I miss my Mkiii Golf!
I prefer the mark 2 body style, but im with you. Lets get it.
YAAAY!❤
This ain’t a scene!!! It’s a GOLF CAR!!!! I don’t need a shoulder to cry oooooonnnn
Come to think about i havnt seen an actual Donut video in weeks.
Vw scene in the northeast pretty lit. (Could be better)
8:37 COMMUINITY for those who can't read cursive
I'm glad I was able to experience the height of the VW community.
It's not a TDI?  I'm so, so, so sorry....
This is great, have had a mk4 gti project for 2 years now and soon to be done with it hopefully. And I’m picking up a mk3 this weekend to start another project. We need more vw content from James.
I've never owned a Golf, but it was honestly one of my dream cars back in high school.
V-DUB N DAS HAUUUUUUUS!!!
I love taking back Sunday AND my first car was a mk4 gti
Love the VW love!
So damn happy to see this car again!!
This reminds me I have a 91 golf thay needs to be finished 😂
I've been collecting and rebuilding wrecked/neglected VW's for about a year. I'm just not famous...
9:47 JAMES YOU SINGLE-HANDEDLY DOUBLE THE PRICE OF THE SAAB C900 DON’T EVEN PLAY
Another membership? Is this how you grift more money from people, it seems like it's always what you do and no one noticed your gimmicks, donut failed because the content was stale...this is new but I can already see mold growing on the crust, more of the same low effort crap since donut😂
Does it make enough POWE FOAKING POOOOOWER does it
Half million views in under 8hours? Dude chill
during dount i wasnt 100% with james but now hes on his own channel hes soooo much better and seems more relaxed :D, i had a VW many years ago but i was the only one who had what i had, it was a VW Polo Mk2 Breadvan 1.05L 1984, it was a pig but it was mine :D
this golf reminds me of a certain minty car that does nothing but flammed at for putting fart noises on peoples builds.... I wonder what it was again?..
I got a mk3.5 cabrio lmk if anyone has parts!! 😂
Yes! Is that "Surf green"? I will be following this build. Hello from Columbus, Ohio, and by the way, it was a great listen on Spike's Car Radio.
My wife is gonna hate that you convinced me to buy a Golf when I already have two miata projects
If you want a cool small ish old car for cheap, look for a 1970 Dodge Dart 4 door with the 225 inline 6. These are cheaper than V8 cars or 2 doors, having both the 6 and 4 doors, u can find a good one for 5k if you look hard enough. 1970 was a 1 year only design with the single tail lights and lighter colored grill. In 71 the grill got darker and the lights went to doual on both sides for a few years....also the early 70s models were not detued for emissions. You may prefer the look of the 71 though, both are great
When i had my 91 corrado g60 i loved vwvortex i loved that forum.
Nah mn idk TOYOTA is doing massive marketing at better vehicle for ur buck
I love VW. i bought my MK4 GLI back in 2013 and i would never get rid of it. Also bought it in SoCal
I had a 1998 mk iv golf gl i still think it the best car I've ever had.
dasmmit bro i just started to save up for a golf project and now they finna be 50k each cuz of James Phucking Humphree
Not James staring at the board like he didn’t write those 5 reasons on the board
I'm not shit buddy. Nobody buddy. I've been watching you from day one. And I have to say I love that your back, I love what you're doing, I love your getting views. Most of all. I love You. God speed brother. ✊
What a coincidence. I had a GTI MK4 that I worked really hard on it but it didnt work well for me so I sold it. Today I was searching for another one to start again. Golfs are sick
I currently drive a mk6 gtd golf it's basically just a diesel version of the gti golf the mk6 gtd were never made available to the us market unfortunately they're 180hp from factory but can be ecu mapped up to 230-240hp
I have a mk4 wagon we get love too??
Yeah this is definitely getting buried here but I'll share. Every reason you highlighted on the list is why I got my 06' Focus ZX3. They have a small but fiercely dedicated community with decades of forums leading back to 2001. They're not as good looking as the Golf though.
Miata Is Always The Answer
Can I hang out with my LS swapped OBS Suburban?
Does a 2000 Passat 1.8t manual wagon count? 😅 I got it for free in VW vortex
This is exactly what we want to see I’m exited to watch you build some cars !!!!
aye, i drive a mk5 GLI
Hell yea James! I always love the VW content!
30 seconds in i was convinced.
As a golf owner I don’t recommend getting a golf because of how bad the transmissions are. Autos, manuals they all suck. Want to put literally any sort of power down? Boom there goes third. Want to rebuild it? That’ll be $1500 and it’s still not a lsd. Want to build it out? $3500 and you send it halfway across the world and wait half a year to get it back. If you’re thinking about getting one and you want to make power. Get a civic or b series swap your golf
Man im enjoying your videos better than donut❤
I didn’t know VWs ever went out of style. As if I needed another reminder that I’m old.
I wanna do a Golf gen 5 project car as my first car. They don't look great but the more modern tech is nice
I had a 24v vr6 and it's the coolest sounding engine in such a dorky looking car lmao
Right On
Here comes the hype tax
Hey James, this is Dave Drell; or rather Volksatan from VWVortex. I heard that you may have bought some parts from my old memory red GtI (from Rob) and I was wondering if that was true? I’d love to see those parts make it onto a running MK3 again. I tried for 18 years with that car and had to give up. I still love that generation and car more than anything else in the world.
We Do Stuff Because RACECAR ..........that's why
I know a pump(hrey) and dump when I see one.
Speeed pump and dumbing VW's... Funny enough I bought a TDI Jetta last Friday.
dude you have to get this car to Helen for Alpine Volks Fair.
Watching this as my Jetta is rotting in the backyard 😢😂
you should check the brazilian VW scene! you will love it
Yo! More vw content is always a good thing… mo powa babeh
Man vw was all around in our place
Every parent needs to get their kids first car as a complete dangerous pos! That way they can't drive far but also get to learn to keep it moving at least! Mine was an 85 prelude si 460k miles on it! I've been searching for a relatively rust free one to add to my collection!
Someone found some Ozempic. Where the mass man?
I was a massive pvw enthusiast growing up there’s a stack of them in a box somewhere in my parents basement and the amount of joy this build brings me is gonna make me buy an old vw and I’m so excited for it. I bought my first few cars off vw vortex back in 2011/2014 this shit is gonna make me wanna build a show and go car like I always dreamed of
watching this make me miss my mk4 wolfsburg edition jetta, with the 1.8t and manual transmission... best car i had and sold it for cheap because i was thinking it was too broken, while it wasnt...
Make sure they didn’t cut the brakes. Or put sugar in the gas tank.
Hell yeahhh! btw that medium build hat is sick...love that guys music!!
Glad to see it back, come to Wookies!
Come by to long beach . We're hosting a euro only meet. 90% off us drive Volkswagen. Euros by the beach, February 9th.
16:23 How is the book club not called “speeed reeeading”?
Affordable in Europe, yes...in America? No. Same with the Mustang but reverse.
This is going to be epic! Cant wait to see how this goes
Let’s go boys
I miss my 1984 GTI 😢
yo bro do girls still like VW's
Every VW that's ever been present in my life has been the least reliable car I've ever been around
I used to like you…you should doughnut reviews like real doughnuts from doughnut shops and your favourite doughnut should be the jam doughnuts the little tickle of red jam in your belly 😂
I had an '85 Golf 2-door, such a fun car!
Hey man, I was wondering your thoughts on the Golf Alltrack (2019 if your opinion differs on year).  I just got one and love the old wagon-style cars. Im sad that they arent making more, but was curious if you thought of them as highly as the standard golf or if you had a differing opinion of any kind. Thanks for the awesome content brother!
the noise my mini made before the timing and the rod decided to go bye bye along with the lifter LMAO
i have a 1996 golf mk3  same age as me xd ,5 doors i think is a 20th anniversary, and i want to restore it, i love it and never going to sell it, greetings from Spain
Funny,ive always loved vw Jettas,golfs,gti. But my favorite an what started it was the corrado. Never owned a vw tho bcuz i was told they not reliable an had hella electronic issues.
Mk 6 Golf R(2 door in America) owner here.  Absolutely love my golf.  Current project/daily driver car.  Was never a huge VW guy until I got one.  Will never go back again.
If anyone is inspired to buy one id definitely recommend a mk5 GTI, they are a bit faster than the older gens but have less tech than the new ones (you can fully disable traction control from the factory)
Building my Mexican Mk7.5 GTI import 😎😎😎
Fast and Furious Jetta with no calipers is what comes to mind when I think of VW. Make those calipers stand out.
the music choices are so freaking good on this channel
Nice. The mk3 Golfs price was already going up and now they are gonna break the economy...
Got me an 86 2.016v swapped gti and a jazz blue 20th as my daily. Cant ever go wrong with these cars, best bang for your buck in my opinion!
YESSSSSSS SHE'S BAAAAAAAAAAACK
Golf bros UNITE!!
As VW Golf only owner I can say - VW Golfs for life. Previously had VW Golf MK2 1.6 CL (Diesel) from '91, straight from factory in Germany as it was won in Lottery back then (yup, our family was lucky then). We kept it until 2019 when we sold it to close friend who needed car for learning to drive manual as we already got VW Golf MK 4 1.9 TDI (2004) and WV Golf MK 7 1.6 TDI Trendline (2014). Both 2 cars after MK2 are bought slightly used, both under 100k km's (or in case of MK7 under 85k km's with importing it from Germany and driving it to Croatia on highways almost 6 years ago, while for MK4 it was about 75k km's on odometer after buying it second hand from guy who got it from lease and got new one so this was spare as he used it to drive from home to work only in 5 years of usage back then, almost 16 years ago, damn). Both slightly used cars are paid less then 10k € with all taxes (including import duties for MK7, car was about 8k € from private seller in Germany, flew there to give him cash and drove car to home in 2 days). Both cars have minor modifications like replaced stereo systems with new ones (Mk7 obviously have new infotainment which looks like stock one and have Android Auto integrated plus backup camera while MK 4 have new radio and GPS addition with minor engine tweak for better gas consumption on daily driving in city/highway combination to work-home for family members who use it) Hopefully will find newer MK8 soon with solid price and good mileage (kilometers, sorry US) to buy it this year as we need one more car, two for family of 4 is not enough sometimes :P Edit: MK8 package will see, something decent, not base model, but also manual shifters as others are (or maybe DSG need bit of research and as our mechanic about it and how it is for managing it) and for import hopefully, we don't trust our people who "import" cars and maybe do shady things with it and as it can be seen - diesel is obvious, TDI life 💪
Actually Honda are the best first project car and you forget the import scene was big before the vw that aren’t the original beetle. You can get a running civic hatch for less than 4k.
Give the deets on the 07k build! I have one sitting in a Jetta that we parked 5 years ago and I’d like to make it cool
I think that car will be hiding a lot more rust in annoying unreachable places. I would start again with a less rusty Mk3 Golf GTI but rebuild the existing engine
Me crying 6 year of pain with a fkn golf and a bunch other….. so yeah you should buy one too
IMO you and Cammisa are amongst the best automotive storytellers OF ALL TIME 💪🐐. Loved this…
Three mk1 s (one pickup one two door and one four door all diesels) these are my problem I meet projects but my day is an mk6 tdi golf so I’m good
Get an r32 😂
This is what we're here for, passionate build content, you love to see it.
How exciting!
Im celebrating 24 years of Mk3 ownership this year.  95’ VR swapped and bagged Cabrio on 17” AZEV As.
ON MY THIRD GOLF!! 2019 awd golf wagon 1.8t  does great donuts in the snow 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
I love that 2.5s are gaining popularity cause I can't find ANY fun parts for it. Tbf I have a beetle so it's a bit different but a girl can hope
Chassis is THE car. If you change chassis its different car.
My 1st car was a jetta 89 Wolfsburg editon..love that car
I picked up my 05 GTI 3 years ago for $3200. The next person who gets it will be my son after I die.
Good friends with the owner of one of the largest if not the largest VW parts seller in the USA. He has a Harlequin Mk3, and it is amazing. I remember the first time I got into one of his cars as a kid he had to explain to me what a radar detector was, and that it would go off if we were close to grocery stores as a false positive from the automatic doors. This would have been ~2003-2004.
Shoutout humble mechanic !!!
Project car timeeeee!
LFG dude, you convinced me to buy a golf
Golf’s are cool! I have a weird one, someone painted the panels mix matched colors for whatever reason.
I love my mk5 but man is it a headache sometimes.
Cant wait for the next episodes!
👈My last Why Not ended up costing 85,000$ ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!!!
We NEED a “Golf with a butt” sticker
Bro def has 50 mk3s ready to sell when they skyrocket in price
I too was on VWvortex back in the day, picking up parts for my 94 Passat. Glad to see more VW content. Someone killed my eGolf (Very slept on model imo) in October and I still miss her terribly.
Chill Vw head gasket lol
Dude should come to México, here we hace a massive community for VW lovers we calle the "Vaggetos" is kinda like meme 😅
Ever since my friend had the VR6 GTI I was sold. I had a 1994 golf and had to give it back. I loved that car. Years later had a two door 06 GTI but then I adopted kids and needed more room. I missed that car. Now I have a 16 Jetta Sport manual and  I love that car. When it’s paid off it’s game on. Thanks for the content.
Fix her up and get a mk1
I have a 2007 jetta gli fahrenheit edition built block 400whp is my first vw I love this car
Bro where's the AE86?
Just listed my MK6 for sale… this video hurts my soul, I don’t want to sell it really 😭
Hi everyone. I had a mk3 2.0 slow for such a long time. It was one of my favourites cars ever and I did so many jobs on that thing. It was awesome, full vr6 interior. Push start button. Gearbox, wheels, suspension. It was my loyal companion for so long. I have so many cars now and some of the shop invoices are more than the total value of that Mk3 but it just meant so very very much to me. Don't be in a rush. Enjoy your cars, connect with them. It never feels as good as you think when you finally get that dream car. The Journey is the reward.
cant wait to get this build underway love this car so hyped to see you got her back always wished this car got more air time. LETS GO!
Not a fan of the golf but I totally understand the passionate niche car enthusiasm. #foxbody4life
I've got a 03 jetta 2.sloowww lol
should come to mexico and get one
I would never be this lucky with any car that sits for years starts right up
Cant wait until my own MK2 GTI is back ln the road!
I already have a datsun project dawg
YAYYYYYYY
Fuck yes. VAG boys unite
I have a golf with a butt
STOCK GIVING AWAY OUR SECRETS
I’m not into the car scene or anything but I just bought a golf in December!
Dude when that thing started up first try like that I almost cried. I've dealt with a blown engine before and I know thst feeling of it just hanging in there despite it.
I’m over here looking at that 2.5 motor you were talking about, thinking to buy it and build a Jetta but I’m literally getting a prelude in a couple months
Do i hear big time Collab?????
James' passion is so palpable. This is what endears me to watching your vids man. Thank you for brightening my day.
Picking up a mk4 jetta 1.8t in 2 days, and got the mk3 jetta 8v waiting for warmer days in the driveway. 2025 is the year of the *good* Volkswagen
They certainly are cheap. That’s why I have 5, 2 of them being 07K powered. If VW addiction counted as an edge break, I’d be done for.
instructions unclear i have a MINI lol
This man is spitting facts, MK7 is already affordable. I daily drive a jetta when my MK1 rabbit pickup is acting up. I too grew up on vortex. The next dream is to tear apart the MK7 and put it all in the rabbit pickup but I'm waiting for more youtube content to follow first.
I miss my mk3 golf one day I’ll have another one
Best looking car for sure, but they do fall apart very easy, reliability is not in the name with the Volkswagen golf but if you do you want to spend money on a project car and go fast right on par with c5 corvette this car is the one of the best in practical cars to spend your money on.
I had a 96 mk3 vr6 Gti a while ago and loved that thing. Currently have a ZHP e46 and funny timing with this video getting posted but looking to pick up another mk3 Gti vr6. VERY hard to find in good condition without damage or a ton of mods but they are out there.
Anyone else go to Dubwars at Buttonwillow back in the day? So much fun!
Im a simple man, i see james and i click watch (and the like button for the algorithm gods)
Never. Hondas for life. But i will come hang out no doubt an talk car. 3:15 so the entire reason cars shows suck now are because of the vdubs at h20? Lol jk
As someone who loves the mk3 vw golf and has been on and off looking to get one again since having one in high-school along with going to vw shows and dreaming of putting together the golf i always wanted... I'm beyond pumped for this new build series 🙌🏼
If your gonna stick with the circle headlights a nice little detail would be to cover up the panel lines between the bumper and the headlight housings
Glad you got her back. You in any other car, I would not recognize, let along throw the V.
James.. your car was over 6k mike was under 650 cash.. running and driving, n my bike was under a grand.. all I see is cali coas and it hurts deeply.  I’d to love to see where it adds up and makes sense. But even fixing and modding my stuff doesnt compare… please go to an actual state and build a car for a realistic price! I’d love to see bud! These prices DO NOT RELATE to me and how im living. Yet I would certainly love to see it!
You gotten thin. I hope you're okay.
We not gonna address the Castro family been doing God’s work on Pimp my Ride back in the day.
I used to drive into nyc just to buy VW performance Magazines
the Louisville Legend strikes again with another relatable vidja that justifies my GTI build lol
My first car was an 82 Rabbit Convertible. My second car was a 81 Rabbit. My third car was a 79 Rabbit. I spent my summers at VWs on the Green and Bug Fest. VWs get into your blood!
Miss my mk3 and mk4 a lot after watching this.
Super excited for the build! My brother is a big Volkswagen guy but I’ve never been able to get it. I do own a Fiesta ST though so I get the appeal, hopefully I get the bug too <3
It’s so cool that you actually started a book club. Lol
HA I own a Golf 6, was never prouder to have a golf 6 as my first car. It was my mums car and we bought it new back in 2009. It has a small 1.4 NA 4cyl engine with 80hp, but it is very reliable. It ain’t got much features, but an automatic climate control, fog lights and mirror heating. Since we tend to have cold winters in Germany it‘s quite practical. I aim for a MK6 GTI as my second car, but since im studying in University right now, it can take from 2 to 6 years until that dream comes true. Always happy to see so much love for the Golf all over the World
Can I still be in the club with a 2024 GTI 👉🏻👈🏻
Get an 09 rabbit they have that five cylinder in them and he’s right it is an absolutely amazing engine, they last forever and are dirt cheap because nobody ever buys them, nothing goes wrong with them the ones out of wrecked cars are pocket change
I've been on vortex since before the great crash in 1999.
I just found your channel!! You lost a lot of weight you look great. Thank you for your hard work channel  is awesome.
If you want period correct you "might as well" do a vr6!!
Never. Hondas for life. But i will come hang out no doubt an talk car.
The Golf is such a timeless car. I own my Golf 4 for nearly 10 years now (since I turned 18 and then got my license, it's my first car!) And it's perfect for me. Bodykit, own design wrap, rims... and the speed is perfectly fine in the city.  Volkswagen was such a inspiring name when it came to cars.
I don't have a VW Golf.  I have a VW Rabbit...so THERE!!! NANNYNANNYBOOBOO!
Par for the course! Another great video guys!
Fuckin amazing video dude
Bring it back to loe show this year!
I’m a Volvo dude myself, but I will never not enjoy someone elses passion for cars. I drive a V70 D5, no major mods as I daily it rn, just a stage 1 bsr map.  Many of my mates grew up in either a Civic or a Golf. They’re not uncommon today, but most newer ones I see are Mk6 and unmodded, which is fine but also abit sad to see a community die. Not weird, i’m mid 30s and kids are a thing for many of us, a tuner car aint top of prio.   Interesting project James, eager to follow it!
I don't have a golf, but I do have a 2002 audi tt quattro. Where are the vw/audi groups in LA?
Ive done several “might as wells” for my civic 😂14:07
Hey James! My Golf project car is a MkIII Jetta, and my other project car is a MkIV Jetta, and, of course, my other project car is a CRX. If I live long enough, at least one of these cars will ride again.
Had both a Golf Mk2 and Mk3. Those cars were fun AF!
I have two VWs. A 15yr old TDI Golf(tuned a bit)and an 8 yr old AWD Passat Wagon I use for the winter here in Maine. I used to think my Subaru was a winter beast but I shit you not this Passat Wagon I have for the winters is a fking tank with studded snows. Or even un-studded winters. And both have been crazy reliable.  When I get a new every day sometime soon(looking at the new 4 Runner right now) the TDI is getting an AWD kit.
Its funny. got my first car about 2 years ago at a car auction. Its a golf mk3 stick. we get in it and I notice after moving it that there's a pool of oil under.   "no worries It must be from another car"  I spent over 100 buckaroos in oil getting it to my house. a little consulting with my grandpa later and I jbwelded the hole in the oil pan shut.  It ran fine for about 1 year. Then its water pump started to go.  Now its in purgatory cause I don't have money to fix it or get someone to look at it.  Still love my little river hottie.
H20 is Woodstock 99
all this golf talk, you cant forget about the polo, its a fun sized golf, and the engines are so damn reliable, and modded GTI's are sick af
Nah dude, my parents let me buy a 65 thunderbird and let me rebuild it when I was 16, no airbags, no crumple zone, no ac, all steel😂
Yes!! But, F&$K that. Gotta enough projects
SICK!  Goodluck with your project car man.
Besides losing my BRZ you're the reason I considered my current mk4 tdi
golf everything
The same passion you have for golfs, I have for the prelude.
Imma vw lover and your up to speed on the jetta and golf were my favorite YouTube videos of all time until now…….❤
That motor is the same my ex had in it, she can keep that 5cyl illl stick my 4cyl for cheap fun i am good off that 😂 Never the lesss much love to yall
Garage update, when?
My Mark 3 is one of the most reliable fun cars I’ve ever owned right behind the Mustang and the Evo and the Jeep and the RX7 and the Saleen……you get the point it’s a fkn amazing little car I I can’t recommend it more for a first car I froze the engine completely solid still drove it 20 minutes to where I had to go and 20 minutes home and only had to replace the plastic fitting on the side of the head that distributes water to different places. The oil cooler pissed all the oil out on the road, I just took the gasket out of one of my Mustang oil filters and put it in there and it’s been solid ever since. These cars are amazing Fuel injected but they still have a distributor and single coil. You can’t go wrong but if you ever come across a factory distributor that someone is selling cheap buy it that is a problem with them that I’ve never experienced but I’ve heard about. The pickup goes in them and Chinese replacements don’t work well
Glad to see your channels really growing. Can't wait to see you start working on the car. Fun times ahead.
Unpopular opinion: Golf mk3 is the worst looking golf (golf mk2 goated)
We wanna see a BigTime collab!!!!
need an overview of why wagons and hatches are so damn cool
Not a VW guy anymore but I'm down for a build series. Definitely hope you can do period correct parts, especially wheels.
THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW... TO GET UP TO SPEEED.... ON THE VOLKSWAGON GOLF
Best bang for buck has to be the K24 series motors into just about anything surely- wack a k24 Euro R motor in that golf- thank me later.
I wanted a gti so bad in highschool.
Yo
Agree 100% the VW scene was the best one back in the 90's/early 2000's.  So glad to see this!  Still have a Mk1 Jetta GLI and daily a MK7 GTI.  Had a Mk3 GL (beater that still was fun), Mk3 Jetta GLI VR6, Scirocco 16v, Mk4 GTI 1.8t nevar lose and even a Vanagon for a decade or so.  VWVortex account since '01, first Waterfest was '98.  DCIVW OG.  Also shout out to PVW, glad to see it's back up with new ownership.
Loved my mk4 jetta. 01 GLX
Your making me want to keep my vw lupo/seat arosa the comunity is amazing and there is a few clubs I could join the only reason I want to get rid of it is because I want an mx5 mk1
Am I crazy or is the membership for this channel not showing up properly? Or is the membership thing part of the discord?
L video
im just going to go watch big time
6:44 correction (THE) most famous VW engine…
I was missing my mk1 golf and was thinking today that it would be cool to have a mk1 jetta.
I drive a 01 Passat. Can I hangout?
I get high off Jesse’s passion😻✨.  & I miss hearing him say hurspurrrssss😹✨
me and my parents just finished rebuilding a MK4 Jetta TDI stickshift and honestly this car is so awesome and my dad has owned multiple different types of MK4 VWs and some MK3's, i love these cars, and they are not that bad to work on
And just like that gtis are now going to double in value😂
My old car was featured in one of those performance VW magazines. The one that says 'cannonball' on the front. My car is the blue Seat Ibiza Cupra. Good luck with your project!
I just turned 290k on my molested, unmaintained AWP jetta. 120k on one oil change. lol
Currently putting my og vr6 gti back togtgee stuck on wiring every vw nightmare
❤
Eg Civic gang for life,  best swaps, best looking hatch ever made, best performing 4 cylinders and by far Honda dominates the SSFWD drags.
8:25 is a Golf Mk2, not a MK1
That golf got me to buy a 2008 VW rabbit. Love the 07k so much it really is the best bang for your buck.
I know of a guy whos swapping an 07k in his Z32 300zx
You savaged that guys shop with all that burnt oil fumes
Yes!!!!
Look James you’re a cool dude to entertain me but you’re a golf guy and I’m a Beamer boy with my m3 so peace was never a option. Thank you
I owned a mk4 jetta wagon with a 1.8t and a 5 speed as my first project. it was a headache at times, but i will NEVER forget the fun i had in that car and the memories i made in it. will always regret getting rid of it.
I've wanted a golf since 2016 and in November 2024 I got an mk8 r. It's so fuckin fun. Worth every penny
Put WIDER Widebody kit on it!!!, it will be released this year
i cant put into words how much help and money i saved and how much time i spent on my car and on VW forums, big shout out to the uk car scene aswell as everyone else for being so helpful and one very very big and special thank you to Hoggy on ttforums, what a humble hero, thanks hoggy and everyone else.   wish you all the best smiles per gallon
I’m a VW fan, I own a GLI Jetta but a Golf is my dream car.
Love my 1997 MK3 JETTA. I call it a unicorn because is All original 105k miles VR6 , White (F&F) and Automatic transmission. I stayed in WaterFest and H20i
Less history, less promo, more car please
98-00 Volvo. Everything else is sub par.
So happy you've made this channel. W content, W hersperrrrrr
2 days ago I bought a 2024 GTI, 6 speed manual, that had 9 miles on it, for 31k, from the dealership.  I'm happy.   Just saying......
you think you golf powerful? hi have satria gti.
Ngl I usually got annoyed by james but he’s not bad when he isn’t SCREAMING into the mic.
I had a 2002 gti and you know why I don't anymore .... 😂 Yeah Volkswagen that's why they are not bang for buck.  Your literally chasing one issue after another soon as you fix one thing two to three will break like clockwork.  Then parts quality it's just not there.   Plenty of times returning OEM parts within a month.     Girls don't like GTIs they like Jettas and beatles and mommas got the vans.
The VW Golf is to millennials what the Honda Civic is to Gen X
Why
maybee AWD swap to put all of those beer chuggin buff german horses to road?
If you can find one...
I hope we see the Paul install option, and Humble Mechanic tags along
my profile pic is my Single own mk4 gti making 800whp @willworkforcarparts
I have a 01 jetta,  does that count?
Vw passats is a god vw platform to 😊
I'm a new guy to Speeed (only a few weeks). From a creative perspective (musician), I think there's a reason why James and the team gets 416,000 views in 6 hours. Top-notch production. I love Speeed simply from a creative perspective. Great job team!
21:37 that smoke cloud just sitting there cracked me up for some reason
I’m still trying to buy my sisters 80’s Gti it’s been 10 years
The segways are cold!
dudeee
More Castro we love this dude
I love my mk2 jetta
Commuinity
my mom had a gold mark 3 growing up and is probably why i still ove em to this day
Wait did James leave donut?
How we gonna hangout man? I'm in Australia 🤔
5. Jason Camissa is also a huge golf fan. He has a MK1 Golf Cabriolet with a swapped engine.  On my end, I am selling my MK1 Golf GL as car ownership is Singapore is just way ridiculous
Yaaaaaay, Vee Dub content.
Who is the bald red guy? Lmao
daaamn H20 bringing back memories haha
Shoulda left it there
Yo i have a golf too!!!
Should do some Golf merch
Bring back up to speed mannn
over in the uk mk3 are scrap now you could buy a whole for scrap metal prices £110 mk2 and mk1 gti £15000 to £30000 mint
Tiguan=Big Golf?
I want to see a complete transformation,  color and body! Get to work!
Mans doing good, literally look at some in my area now lol. Dangit now I want one. Thanks
Yesssss car stuff
What’s the discord
Speeed stealing all of donuts views lol
Just got a 02 mk4 turbo
As someone who has a 2004 Mk4 Golf GL coupe with less than 60k miles on it in his garage, I support this series. Thanks for the Golf love, James and everybody on the Speeed Team!
OMG James needs a hug .... lol 🤙 my 73 supper Beatle made the ski hill of Switzer everyday. Heater sucks but it mobbs
Hell yea dude
i have a fully clapped mk4 2 door that needs everything. i want to fix it so i can meet other vw peeps.
The golf gti or R and the jetta gli are both project cars i want to build with my dad cause he had both the jetta and the golf gti but he wants to build a golf R man these cars are just great unlimited customization for it😮‍💨😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Respectfully, the Golf is the *second* best project car. Regards, the OG Land Rover Defender TDi/TD5.  I mean, they aren't cheap, there's only a couple of feasible engine options, but they look sick, have a great community and... I have one :)
The mk3 is trash. Get yourself a MB 190e and you’ll love your car. Drives comfortable, quiet, reliable and RWD. That’s the best project car IMO
Tbh I'm just glad James is able to do his own thing I haven't watched anything from donut since him and Jeremiah left
i work for a VW dealership and we call the 2.5L "God's motor"
James. I have a mk4 GTIs can we be friends?
Ill never get rid of my mk4 ALH TDi Golf manual transmission. Ever.
All German cars are for gypsies. Some for rich gypsies. These - for poor gypsies.
It's so weird to me that someone so in love with VW, can't take the effort to pronounce it's name properly. It's Folkswagen, James, Folkswagen!
As an Acura guy and the coolest guy in school once I pulled in in my 95 white GS-R in 12th grade in 2000 oh I know your think that’s the V-Tech and your right is was😂😂😂😂 Anyway I’ll say that was my favorite car I had third I had a jag but my first car was 87 GtI black all bells and whistles 5 speed. You had to pump the clutch to get it to grab or it bucked, sunroof opened with gas closed with break but didn’t leak a drop tied shut with plastic Giant foods bag but my security feature was nobody being able to find 1st gear😂 didn’t have to push down on shifter you had to search and jiggle to find it most ended up in 3rd or reverse. Even Boyd VW in my city could fix it after I got a call asking if I drove it there saying nobody can pull out without stalling out and I had to do it or they could push it with the wrecker but did not believe I drove that thing for years like that and it never broke down only after my dad tried to move it and couldn’t I was forced to take it in, VW was 3rd garage and they had no idea what to do it try they said clutch was fine and engine seemed fine, just a typical old school VW you really had to want to kill those cars and every 90s high schooler had gold/gti/jetta/passat with AA chainsaw mufflers
i love this video. especially after the closing of my home countries biggest car meet was shut down, austrias beloved GTI-Treffen (GTI-Meet) and i like VW, literally the only german car brand i like lmao
if you need MK3 parts i have some laying around. lol we can be buddy's I'm working on a mk3 cabrio at the moment.
I had a 1986 VW Jetta Wolfsburg Edition. Lowered. Tuned. Daily driven. Belonged to Volksaholic club. Had that car from 1989-1997 once I sold it I saw the car several times in the neighborhood, they did NOT care about car culture. Every time I saw it, it was neglected, they let it go after they got it in a wreck. So sad.
@speeed you need to go to Eurotripper in Helen GA!!!!  VAG Car event 4 - 5 days in a Small town in GA where all the architecture in the town has to be German style by law , every day hosting small meeting and licking the best cars of every event for the final event on the last days with the best cars that were kicked through the past days
I'm on my second Golf (mk7 Sportwagen) and would totally get another Golf/GTI/Jetta for a project car in a hot second.
Project car, now we're talking!!
07k swapping my B7 :)
Poor Americans, I bought my mk3 for 150€ usually they go for 500-2500€
The original Rabbit and Golf are the best platform if you are building a long term car you want to enjoy. Hondas are good but they are a dime a dozen and disposable.
That golf identifies as a WRX 😅
Even though I am very happy with my MK4 golf project have to admit that the MK3 is Good kinda very Strong design/make and without that over-electronic nonsense Will be following for sure ;)
Finally talking about how much VW influenced the entire car scene.
All the young dunmbasses fucked up H2o for everyone
James secretly wants the prices of golf’s to go up. So his increases in value
Gaaaaaaaaaadddd duuumm got that OG mic though
MOE POWA BABA!!!
replicated is where you lost me 😭 hope you make the addcents on 22 seconds brother
The vw golf from the mk5 down are one of if not the greatest cars you could have as a project car. There so easy to work on and if you get one with a pd engine your onto a winner.
still think the OG hot hatch golf killer is a more fun platform. FX16 or bust
Golf, Jettas and even Beetle TDIs have always had a place in my heart ❤️
You trying to kill the market like Jimmy Oakes did with the s chassis.  Lol 10:28
Yeah mk3 golf is the ultimate car, you can do whatever you want with them, race them, drive on and off-road, plus they are tough and cheap.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really enjoyed how this was written
Oh no he said the thing. Might as well. This car is gonna be SICK
Where is the ae86
IM DOWN TO HANG OUT BUT IM A HONDA GUY AT HEART ....ANYTHING HONDA
I’m confused why did everyone leave donut?
hyped about the engine build portion, huge 07k fan. totally slept on engine!!
You need to get with the boys at bigtime and make a top gear style crossover show between yall! It Would be sick!
I come from the air cooled VW scene and I got a mk4 gti 1.8t a couple years ago as a commuter car and its been a fun car to drive.
been looking for a mark 3 golf for a few years.. but here in Québec they all rusted away, so those that are left, are overpriced for the work needed, or are barelly holdind up! Still have 2 set of 16v to put on a 2slow..
What happened to the AE86?
Saying that the Custom Widebody G3 with a R8 V10 Engine and a Custom Frame, is a copy of your car is pretty bold statement. (For everyone interested. JP performance Project G3)
Sir james hi im your fan from Philippines i hope you make a vlog in Thailand concept bikes in Philippines or in thailand like talking about Philippines thailand concept bikes since or thailand bikes since i hope you make a vlog of it i love all your episodes seance your at donut and am happy that your starting all over again for you own channel i will watch all your episodes thank you sir james i love you❤
0:40 Me who is in love with the mk 4 Golf (specifically the VR5, VR6 2.8L and VR6 3.2L): *Heck yeah!*
More powah baby
Can i join if i have an old a6 wagon? 😅
Shout-out to Castro's harbor freight magnet light
ayy he still likes cars:)
Two words " Safari Jetta "
Man, this is such a quality production. The writing, the editing, style/format etc…great mix between informative and entertaining, absolute class, well done🫡👌🏾
Finally, the kind of video this channel deserves
Bought a mk2 gti for $1.1k around 2004 lasted about 7 years with barely any maintenence. Later bought mk3 vr6 gti for $3.8k and lasted about 4 years with barely any maintenence either. Spending more than 5k for mk3 is too much unless it's super mint
I love this video! I’ve had 3 wait 4 vws now and absolutely loved each of them.  From an 86 golf to a 2015 jetta, absolutely perfect design, simple Lego like design.  Happily rockin a MK6 tdi all stock and plan on keeping it that way!
Love my 337 MK4 more than any car I’ve driven!
I got a golf mk4 2003 tdi stage 3 like it so much that I sold my  daily focus 2010 for a 2005 tdi stock golf platform for life , there's some things in old golf or vw older then 2000 that can't be explained but will always be loved ❤
Do they make a mk4 jetta grill with those aux lights available?
Desperate attempt to make friends😂😂😂. Buy a golf so we can hang out is gold
Yessss!!!! Back to cars!!
Cheaper to buy one 75%-90% complete than try to build it
H2Oi…. long live Cort
As a 30 something year old without a  license you make me want to get this car xD 🤣
A super rusty 30yr old golf with a blown engine sounds like a true youtube project car
What about a Seat Leon mk1 it’s basically a golf right?
VENTILATION
7:02 eeeerr, I feel like.... a lot of European companies?
Never was a VW guy till i bought my friends MK4 TDI that Eurowise put together, it has become one of the best cars I've ever owned, literally love that car
I got mk4 tdi project 🥲
I didmt make it to the last h20 and i thought i would just simply go the next year however i was horribly mistaken, RIP H20
Hearing James say let me tell you a story is like an epiphany
My first new car was a 96 Gti. Was heavily into vwvortex, waterfest, H2oi etc. Vw was life back then. I had so many issues of PVW, went to gtgs, made tons of friends, worked on cars, sold one, got another, sold it, got another, sold it lol. I had mk3 cabrios, jettas and gtis for over 15 years. Good times for sure. I’ve actually been eyeballing a few VR6’s again…but my wallet keeps telling me no.   And hold up…was HumbleSLC on vortex Humble Mechanic???
You should make a “Members Only” jacket! I would watch a Speeed video on the 80’s icon!
My 04 Golf r32 is my projected and daily driver lmao
there was a time in germany you could not buy a more boring car than the golf. could happen that there were no other cars at some supermarket parkings, especially around regions vw had a factory close to. thats why so many were modified at least a bit. having a set of wheels was mandatory when under age 30.   what we see here as VW specific styling and culture actually reflects what was going on in european tuning scene generally speaking. could find tons of opel/vauxhall, euro-fords, french brands being styled similar.
Damnit, James! Now I've got to go out and find the white 1G Talon TSi from my childhood.
get a mk5 the mk3 and mk4 are cool to look at but they are fried money pit cars
Already got a gold project! Love these golfs they r fun ass lil cars!
RIP H20i
So happy to see this car being resurrected. It will definitely be able to make it on to the cover of PVW. Maybe even win some (L’oe) show awards😉
The Jetta and Vento in Germany are nicknamed "Golf with Backpack". Also the Derby is nicknamed the "Polo with Backpack"
I like seeing you get older and maturing. It's good man.
I kinda do have a Golf project of my own. It's just a Caddy.
Y’all remember SoWo?
I just bought a 95 Jetta GLX last year to build with my son. I forgot how fun these cars were to drive. I like Jetta butts and I cannot lie.
I love this, so hlad its coming back. My first vw was a mk3  and kicked off my vw bug..  I Started making mk3 content for my channel 4 years ago, sold it for a mk2 golf and ended up buying another one because they're so good. Easy to work on, parts aren't too bad and they're cool. Get one 👌🏾 I also need to finish off my convertible  so give me some motivation 🙏🏾  I can also help with the interior, i run an automotive upholstery business in the uk so i can ship you out custom seat covers you install
makes me want to revive my 98 ginster vr6 gti drivers edition
I just bought a 95 Jetta GLX last year to build with my son. I forgot how fun these cars were to drive.
I have a patina mk4 gti Vr6 Rave Green love my car even though it needs paint. Motor still runs so strong!💪
Man you are looking healthy and good bro. Long time fan of you and doughnut.
Can you review a mk7 GTI
I do love a MK1 Golf, but I'm definitely more of a Focus guy. Current project is a '06 Focus ZX4 ST called "Project Taz." It is named after Taz from Looney Tunes because of the way it sounds, it's currently an open race header. I've already got quite a bit done, but I still have a long way to go before it's perfect.
my mk3 jetta was the first car i loved. amazing lil nuggets
I used to be hardcore VW. If I had never found my GS400, I'd probably be driving a VR-T mk4 Getta wagon
I thought 🤔 this was going to be a channel about methamphetamine or amphetamines.
I own a 3.5 cabriolet and this makes me so happy to see you making some dope golf content and car content again ❤
Might as well is always the right call! …and expensive 😂
I dunno i think a wrx with a k20a in it is better........
Na ill stick with the crx m3 and sup
I used to have a white 97 MK3 which was first my parent's car and then passed down to me as my first car which I used throughout High School and College until I eventually sold it. I still miss that car alot as it was the car that got me into this hobby and modified it however I could with the little money I had at the time. If I ever get the opportunity to buy that car back, I would definitely do it in a heartbeat
Had a mk3 GL with a cammed 2.0 for a few months, sold it for a second miata thinking the Volkswagen platform wasn't for me. Now I miss it and looking for a 1.8T mk4!
I don't love my golf for the people I love it because it's my golf and I don't care what people think about my lil slow golf
15:57 "Who tf is honking their....oh. It's James. :)"
proud 1.9 Tdi owner
Is big time gonna be involved in the rebuild ???
This is the first time a car YouTuber recommended that I buy a car I could actually afford in my home country (Brazil). Thanks James!
Buying a VW 😂
My fathers first car was a rabbit. Coming from a Honda family that’s had every gen from Ef to em including the crx and del sol. And fans of the road runner, Camaros and me the fast back mustangs. Volkswagen was where my father started and what may have got my family into the car workd
Pumphrey just gilded the Golf 👌
Dammit now I miss my MK4 Gti VR6 I had in 2009. Time to get another one!
That diagnosis made me so happy. Now, just don't sit on it forever. Please.
Letssss goooo
Very ironic to be talking about reliability either one of the most unreliable cars in the world behind you
Good god...6 hours into the release of this video and theres 360k views.    You go!!!
This is so much better then what donut is now 🙌🏽
Love James. Love speeed. Dont love Golfs. Love how much James loves his Speeed golf
I bought a project Mk5 Rabbit with 70k miles on it to learn to drive stick, Midwest car with 0 rust, and the clutch died on the 3rd drive. Womp Womp, but we got a project going boys.
My dad had a 05 Jetta for 12 years and used it to drive from Chino Hills to Venice every day and the car needed to be totalled for him to swap it for something else. Sure it started to die at 150k miles but how many cars can last that long in the first place?
Family!
KW turbo wheels are a must to come back to that car!
just got my girlfriend an mk5 rabbit and i absolutely love it
Omg that cap bouncing around about to pop off the engine is the funniest fucking thing I've seen this week. If Youtube had animated profile pictures that would be a perfect one.
❤ make for life but being honest mk3 Jetta
Now for the hellephant crate engine swap. 1000hp into that little vdub. Thatd be sick!
what is your vw discord???
Thanks for always keepin it real, James 🫶
James, I'm assuming you might have a VCDS kit, if not, let me know and I'll get you taken care of.  Ross-Tech started off as a hobby project by the owner who wanted to scan his 1997 VR6 GTI.
Are you listening whoo ohh ah oh
I’ve Missed this content. And man I live that we have a creator focusing on VW!! Represent bro!!!
#6 the smell They always have a distinctive interior smell especially the older ones
17:25 funny how he’s like crying
The VR6 is why I bought my Passat GT
Bro I just so happened to rock that shirt today, I was so happy when I saw this get posted
Sick Medium Build hat!
Car vid by James, you know it's good
YIPPIE
Now I miss my mk4 GLI. Man, it was either loved or hated, no in between. I was a tool back then. Had me a build post on vortex, bagged, cut and redesigned the car to lay rocker, obviously had me some RS’s but that wasn’t enough, so I had the faces chromed, polished lips, half caps and spike bolts. Took it to Waterfest and drove home with a 3rd in mk4 mod 3 (I think it was). Draggin the car on my way out of the show and someone yelled “let’s see you do it on a 45 series tire!”, because I was on a 40 series. 😂 One day I’ll build another one and change a few things I should have done then. PVW did toss a pic of it in one issue but I can’t remember what one. Eurotuner as well. What a crowd though back then in the early 2000’s on the east coast. Had me some good friends with some solid builds and fast VW’s. Mostly vr6 big turbo and 1.8t stuff. Mmmm Eurodyne Maestro was the best back then!
Man this gonna be good
I had a MK7 GTI and I miss it dearly. 😢 DSG farts are sick.
18:57 in Germany we say "TÜV sagt nein"
I've been trying to find parts for the mk5. Fender louvers. Just different things for them. Recently got a 3d printer. Gonna be trying to develop some parts
Love me a good Volkswagen build!
LFG! 🔥
Where I live if you don't pay attention to where you walkin' you will trip over Vdub.
Like KuruHS said. "The golf is just better
Thank god I bought my golf gti before this video dropped and drives the price way up
I'll say this bit James bro ya look good. Slimmed down alot homie looks good hope ya feel good
Oh wow I had no idea this car was this hurt.  Glad to see you'll be bringing it back to speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
I was just reminiscing on the good old H20i days and euro scene before the "outsiders" ruined it. Word of advice to any youngsters who are wanting to get into the community just know the V.A.G. enthusiasts are like a family. We don't care how quick or fast your car is or whether or not you can destroy tires. We are all about the little details like period correct wheels, OEM+, clean or hard to find accessories. We're essentially old nerds that'll see dual rounds and follow you to wherever you're going to talk to you about your car.
Y E S !
I'm not buying a Golf. What? Because you have one? Seriously, no. I think you should go buy another Golf. Seems only reasonable based on your logic. It is you who is Golf deficient, I already have two.
You left out eurotuner
3:46 hey my yellow ranger splash
Had 2 Golf 3's, a golf 4, golf 5 and a A3 (pretty much a golf 6 underneath) + a polo so I can say I like this cars but not what i would pick for a project, FWD gets boring quite fast + I hate rust.
As a MK2 owner I can tell the community is just the best even tho the car isn't running .
That engine, sitting that long, with that damage, and it still turns over. MO POWAH BBY
No need to convince me to build a golf.
Yo YouTube unsubbed me automatically! Not fkn fair! I wanna see all the uploads yt wtf! Watch out people make sure you stay subbed smh
What magazine were you showing at about 2 minutes in? I have a blue r32 and that one in the magazine just awakened something in me.
live in a vw family and drive a mk4 jetta tdi, each time the golf was on donut i was enthralled 😭 just one of the reasons you were my favorite on there too haha im glad she’s back
Within the next 2 years, James is gonna make it on the PVW lmao
Aaaaand now we won’t be able to buy a reasonable priced golf for less than 20k 😅
It's kind cliché but you should come to Brasil. After Germany(and I am not even sure of that) it is the best country to be a VW fan. You would lose your shit with the thing people do here
“They look sick” is definitely in the eye of the beholder lol
Other than the mk2, the mk3's are known for being rusty. And now they are old, all of them have rust issues. If you buy another chassi, you buy the same problems, so fix the rust and be happy for the next 20 years.  Greetings from a mk2-owner from near Wolfsburg -love your content! :)
Buy a golf. Argument number 1: "They are cheap".   Me laughing in Brazilian.
This is the content, history and project car, YOU GOT IT
I am from Croatia and I have mk3 jetta imported from New York
Did Tyler the creators BMW have Schnitzers on it?? They're rare asf in the UK if they're 18" concaves
Love the video, hate the use of AI slop. Support people
Absolutely love my mk5 gti. Loved my mk4 as well. Wanna get a mk2, mk3, and mk6
Now thanks to this video im keeping my 97 DE Vr6 jazz and my 20th ae mk4 jazz wide body💙
This episode made me have all the feels, it’s literally made me need to get in the garage and finish my mk2 Jetta project!
I’ve smoked a couple of these in my Scion. They’re both FWD junk but I love my TC 😅
Golf STONKS 📈📈📈
.... Also Dark Matter. Great choice.
No golf but just bought a 2014 TDI sportwagen 6 speed. It’s a crazy fun car to drive! Excited to see this car brought back to life!
I picked up a beetle turbo s for dirt cheap and I feel like an idiot every time the active spoiler flips out of the roof....love it.
More powah baby!
Yes! Not really into cars but your stoke is infectious and I’m here for this.
my mk5 gti is my daily, love it alot, definitely great cars for the price considering the price of everything else.
My first car which has been my dads for years is a Mk4 golf
I really miss my MK3. They are great and very fun cars
I have an 09 rabbit and I can’t find a lot of performance mods that aren’t  from integrated Engineering
If your golf had a hog, you would be cranking the heck out of it! Jesus dude, it’s not responsible for every tuner trend in the 90s
BROOOOO I'm so fucking pumped for this video. YOU got me into VW and Porsche! I got a GTI and 911 Turbo S now. :)
As a long time Mk3 owner that still runs a business making parts for these 90s econoboxes, I ❤ this video. I wish other manufacturers still supported the platform with aftermarket parts.
Dang I miss h20
Stoked for this build
I’ve owned 4 vws two jettas and two gtis had the time of my life with this cars wish I could go back to my younger days with those cars
Brings back memories...Cursive graphic misspelled community but forgiven because James is the man.
love love love JOM mirrors.
MEDIUM BUILD MENTIONED
Honda Toyota Mazda.
I had a 2001 Jetta Wolfsburg that I did so many modifications to. That car is still my favorite car I’ve ever owned. I miss her 😢
James. When are you coming to Wookies in the woods? 😉
I really hope JP invites you over once the G3 at 0:14 is done and all the mishaps are figured out. Also would be a great chance to do a thing about the car enthusiast mekka he created.
JAMES BUILD SERIES LETS GOOOO
Not for nothing but a few of those guys you mentioned used to be part of the SupraForums back in the day. Damn the late 90s and early 2000s car forums were great. I miss those days
My white 85 GTi has a 16V swap and is lowered in white 14” Audi 4000 wheels and is a BLAST to drive!
Jo i got the same problem with my ej6, blown engine and rust. Might as well build the engine.
I still turn to VW Vortex whenever I need to find a fix on our Jetta. It was huge.
The 2.5 in mrk5 was amazing the 1.8t had a ton of problems love seeing you making videos man. SPEEED  forever !!!!
I had a MK3 Golf GTI VR6 as my first car in high school and had to sell it as a broke newlywed 😭 it keeps me up at night thinking about it. I want it back!
love the passion but honda is and always will be bang for buck king
I bought a mk4 Golf, mk1 rabbit gti, and a G35 (all manuals) all because of you buddy.  I haven't regretted a thing, and still have them all. Have been STRUGGLING with getting this scirocco 16 valve to run right in the mk1. NOW I'm considering the 5 cylinder for the umphh. Just gotta put family first and one day I'll have the funds. 😅🎉
Dude . . . that may have been the smoothest sponsorship segment ever.
Still loving my mk6 gti does everything I need it to
Will trade first born for a diesel Jetta
Medium Build hat goes unreasonably hard
These videos have to stop. I can’t afford cars at the prices they’re already at.. jamesflation is not helping
Looking forward to seeing this being rebuilt!😊
my first and current car is a mk4 1.8t gti, having to part ways with it soon cuz i let my dad borrow it while i took a trip to la for my birthday, and on my birthday he called me saying he got inna tbone accident. honestly, if it didnt get into an accident, i wouldve had this thing and kept it alive till the wheels fell off man, i love this platform, i literally cant enjoy driving a car anymore if i cant hear a turbo spool and dump as im driving lol
You need to take the framing from 1:58 and turn that into an actual wall hanger!
have to get this baby documented before ICE takes it back
“They’re cheap” Except I live in the one chunk of the midwest where they aren’t, because theres no VW dealer and no localized way to get parts. I do still really want a golf though despite those complications
I have a mk3 jetta myself pretty worked i love it
I had an 87 GTI.  Piece of sh!t.  How does a car rust in LA, by the way?  HOW?
Those headlights.... 🤮
Love my scirocco
6:30 Can someone explain to me how an old Golf is dangerous when you could easily kill someone in a '20 Honda Jazz ? Was there an exceptional level of fatal Golf accidents in the early 2000's?
Sick! Good luck with the following rebuild James~
VR6 Turbo Baby!
God dang man had to say goodbye to my mk2 for a truck a while ago now and I miss that thing
You just made the prices go up.
Im pretty sure this car was the first video I saw from Donut with James talking about some weather stripping in a parking lot with the car full of random stuff.
What do u think of my VW (pfp)? Got mk3 golf seats in it gg
Love the video. I also grew up with the VW culture. NYC in late 90s/early 2000s. I had a 2001 Jetta GLI and LOVED it. Sure, it smelled like crayons inside, but that car was great. Then I bought a mk5 GTI which got wrecked. And my last one was the mk6, which was so cool. Keep it going man.
Hey kids, Listen to Medium Build. Feel things.
I was fully expecting Jobey to pop up in the intro and fix the car 😅
Just bring me back with VWvortex!!
Cool project.  James is not as funny on this channel.  Maybe the writers helped on the other channel.
Don't buy a golf, buy something weird instead. that's the best bang for buck, not just another modded bloody golf.
No James we pirate. 😂
I’ve been rebuilding a MK5 GTI and it’s been a joy. Love the VW/Golf community.
THE GOLF IS BACK, BABY!!!!!!
If you're rolling a discord you should toss the link into your description so people can find it easier.
Mk3 content forever!!!
E30 heaven ❤
fully shave it. doors, trunk, engine bay, EVERYTHING, SHAVE IT ALL
Hyped man!  I grew up in a Mk2 golf that I inherited from my dad. My next 2 cars were Mk3 golfs.  Really looking forward to this!  You hit so many nostalgia points for me.  VWVortex, H20, Waterfest...like you the mk3 is still my favorite.  Wish I could get my hands on one again but they ones that are avaiable are clapped out af.
This makes me feel less regret putting my life savings into my Xterra to keep it alive, lol.
I don’t mind these cars, but I prefer rwd
Excited for this build!
Not going to lie I gain a lot of car friends because of my vw bora 2.slow good friends till this day
its so refreshing to see a non japanese project on youtube. I dont even own a vw but the jap stuff has been beaten to death content wise
Love the mk3!
So stoked to see you back at it James. Keep it up sir
Watching Paul’s video about this sent me down the rabbit hole and has me putting an 07k in my mk3 Cabrio too! Probably my favorite Mk3 ever. So glad to see you getting it back on the road!!
We’re so back
i let go of my 2014 GLI... and i kinda want a newer one. man what a car
Not a vw owner but I'm glad the community is good. I'm unfortunately a honda enthusiast. Thus, the community is rather toxic. If anyone in the comments knows of a discord or fb group thats more on the wholesome side, I would love to become a member. I have an '88 CRX Si thats currently the magnum opus, and an '09 civic ex for a daily. I'm also a mechanic if that helps.
I really loved my 2 VWs. My 89 Jetta GLI my parents bought new. 250,000 on the 16v. The floor rotted out of it. 😢 and I had an 83 GTI. I was young and it was showing its age. I had just gotten married so I needed something I didn’t have to put money into. I sold it to a guy that restored it completely. I didn’t have the money at the time to give it the love it needed.
I was lost walking on the side of a highway once and a guy in a VW pulled up and offered me a ride... I told him I'd walk.
James working on cars is where it's at. My brother briefly had a Mk1 Golf, cream in colour. That was an awesome little car. Too bad his crazy ex kept it when they split.
Whats the paint code of the golf? Thats a super rad colour
Why do Americans say Voltswagen?
Man I grew up rebuild vw bugs with my dad. My boss has a bunch of VW Bug engines he used in a saw mill. I got one given to me. One that was fully gone threw an never used, now the goal is to find a bug! I have a son now and I'd love to finish one with him an actually be able to go for a drive in together after. I never got to with my dad
But Bro, could I buy a VW Rabbit and still be part of the scene?
The Mark I shape Golf for my birthday in 2008. I still have it, even after having to rebuild it after it being written off. It's nearly 20 years old and It doesn't have 200K on it yet. Love that car.
Damn its almost like Donut was just financing your bullshit for years
damn i didnt know your first car was a 240, its also my first car and i look forward to building it this summer
Let’s go ‼️
Goooood damn!!!! Yes, I love the direction of the channel and everything about it.... but THIS is what I'm talking about. THIS is the one I (hell, WE) will be here for 1000%. Yes, 1000%.  Other stuff too of course, but this project tickles my insides.  Sounds like it might time to fire up some "Save a Golf" Tee shirts to help with funding :)
My dream car was a 1969 Fairlane convertible. I found and bought mine in 2010. In November 2019, I got a flat. I knew there was some rust, but when i went to jack it up, I could not find a solid enough spot to even put a jack on to lift the car. It crushed me, but I tapped out. The car was gone less than a week later. While I loved, and still miss that car, I had to make a logical decision and it was gone a week later and I don't regret moving on.
I had the golf III gti 20 Jahre edition. Most fun car I ever driven and I gad amd mercs and now own an alfa Ti.
Just buy a tow truck and then you can drive a golf without a engine.
James you're looking good im glad to see you doing your own things keep it up man
Grabbed myself a 84 MK1 cabrio this fall.  In Canada so….. it’ll have to wait to be tinkered on. Can’t wait
Please Please Please Bring Back   UP TO SPEED   And   BUMPER TO BUMPER   To Your Channel  Please
Oh, the culture of old VWs is still there, it's just shrunken over the years, along with (IMO) current golf models losing their way as VW decided they wanted to be the largest manufacturer. Can't wait to see what you make out of her.
This is perfect content
Wait I already have a golf. What’s is the discord name ????
Great now the price for them are going to sky rocket
Hyb
Finally! Speeed project car!
Haha, savage.  Saying that JPs V10 Swap is a replica of your car.
My first car was a 96 Jetta and still miss that thing.
Vw 😂😂😂😂😂 naw I'm a machanic I know better.
#vaglife
I loved my old VWs, but now they have become piles of junk.
U dont need to do to much explaining about the golf 3 decision , we understand u fully😂😂❤🫡💯🔥
I'm really liking this content <3
Alright scotto where you at I know you're in here somewhere 😂
Can’t wait for rest of series! Golf’s here in uk are expensive project cars very sort after. My project car is a vw caddy mk1 pickup which I’m vr6 swapping
Finally the content I hoping to see from you. Love this car so much!
Cool. Would love to see the invoice on this as you go.
My aunt who doesnt care about cars got an MK2 Jetta Wolfsburg and could not stop talking about it and how much she loved it.  Her husband builds air ride show cars.  She never said a thing about. But she loved that Jetta.
Im 38 and WAS so closed minded about imports growing up. Shame on me
as a fellow mk3 nerd and owner I thank you for this video
Yeah
Got a much better proposition for a project car, a Fiat Stlio Abarth, and nothing ;)
Mk2 vr6T over here had it for over 5 years, love it. The whole car is mk3 the shell is the only mk2 thing about it
Hell yes! Back in the day, my neighbor gave me his old accord because God told him to or something. I sold it and bought a clapped out Mk1 GTI for $1,600. When it ran, it was THE most fun you could have in a car. I've had 5 VWs since then.   I was working at a restaurant when my female co worker pulled up in a clapped out Mk3. I offered my services and weve been together for 9 years now. So many memories in between.   If we can ever get a house, maybe I'll be able to pick up another one.   Thanks for sharing James. Looking forward to this.
11:07 nice flatbed company plug 😂
My mom had a 98 manual and I got to drive that around when she wasn't looking. Like young. Haha. A1
2.slow was a badge to be worn with honor lol
It's a miracle that underbody brace is still attached to the car. They always get ripped off 😂
Got myself a 01 Jetta for $2k here in cali (559 area)
damn what model is that at 2:50?
man this merch HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
whoa whoa whoa crazy comment about the golf best bang for buck? I know your joking but its Easily the bmw f80 m3 just picked up a clean title one for 17k that is unheard of!
I LOVE this James. He's obviously passionate, but more laid back. He just seemed to channel way too much energy into Donut, like a spokeperson/hypeman/host/idea dude/etc. Too many hats. Now that he IS the channel, he gets to learn, teach, and be chill doing it.   Don't give a damn about VWs of any sort, but will watch to support the man, the myth, the James.
Got a mk4 project.  Currently engine light free😅🤞
Dub life is like nothing else ! The Germans took over the world with the golf! Love my mk6 300,000 miles still going
So JP's R8 with a Golf3 covering is a replica of your bucket?😂😂 Somehow I don't think so.😜
I came to the comments to find out who the “bald red guy on the internet” who said it doesn’t matter what girls like is.
We need VW tdi stuff James
Love that you rock a G wagon though
And whoo, that TDI-caliber dancin' oil fill cap!    I'm a mk4 guy, but STOKED for mk3 project car videos coming down the pipe!
As an ex owner of a Jetta (13 2.5 black) agree 100% very fun, very sporty, miss it but now miata (13 black) and in love again but for different reasons
Dude awesome to see you putting this back together. I have quite a few mk3 euro interior parts and some other goodies sitting here. Hit me up if you need anything to help get this back together.
vibes
2:51 PVW only covers what now? The huge stack of print editions in my archive begs to differ, as they not only do cover Audi, Porsche and, occasionally, exotics, but also SEAT, and a couple off-brand derivatives. 😅
I'm truly loving what you're doing here James, keep it up bro!
Had no clue you grew up in Kentucky. We’re still here trying to make it happen in Lexington.
My first car was a mk3 VR6. Im pretty pumped for this one!
Nothin better than a golf
Hatchbacks are so goddamn ugly
I miss my Mk 6 gti she almost made 300 wheel full bolt ons with a turbo upgrade and I rebuilt the dsg with my buddy who used to work at a VW dealer but I had to sell it to pay off debt life is tough but I have a feeling I’ll own another one
STOP IT! I can't start a new project James! I still have a project in desperate need of attention and money! It's your fault I got that one!
my older brothers first car was an 84 Jetta diesel, he then gave it too me when he bought a newer Jetta, making it my first cat too. it was a cathartic day when we were both walking through the junk yard looking for parts for my Toyota pickup, when we stumbled upon both of our first car, we both just stopped and stared at it for  a good 10 - 15 minutes reliving the adventures we both had in it. a gutless, old, bare bones Jetta had quite the impact.
Honestly, its an ugly...may even say rather hideous looking automobile 🤷 I don't understand how anyone ever got into the VW thing
I do miss my mk3s but their manual transmissions do not like the winter, i had two different ones that when they were cold second gear was non-existent and instead of trying forever i would just overrev and do 1st to 3rd. 2.0 aba manuals
Cool vid man, even if I don’t particularly like vags they are quite cool. And this car is the proof that the story of Italian cars’ is not true 😂
VW Discord where?  Building a mk1 with a turbo 8v on Frankenstein CIS
🔥
Always liked golfs especially a mk3 vr6
pretty excited to see what you cause i got a mk5 that i wanna upgrade please post links to everything you use!!!!
Fuck yea James. I'm here for it. Throwback to the 'tex days. Man, those were some good times on the forums. A lot of good people on there. A lot of good information housed there too. Sucks how it was mismanaged and things fell apart over there.
Shiiiitzzzyeahhhhhhhh VWdubawub tymmmmmeeeeee
I miss the old Vortex days, and especially the mk3 forums <#
My first car and the only car I would want to buy again.  Had a 1995 Golf Sport, a strange thing VW did in Canada one year...replaced the GTI name with Sport for no reason.  It came with rare tartan style seats that are desirable and I believe only ever came in that Golf Sport.  It was just a 2.0 8v but it was built by a friends brother.  Entire valve train, msd ignition, magnaflow 2.25", 17" wheels with bilsteins and lowering springs.  I had even had a Neuspeed SC for it with high alt pulley but never did get around to installing it.  I soent so much time on VWVortex back in the day drooling over all the staggared fitments and stance.  OEM+.  I never installed the SC cause I always wanted a VR6 swap and was gonna sell the charger to fun the swap but it just never materialized and the car was eventually stolen.  Some of my fav parts I had for it were the legit MK4 style Hella headlamps that cost me almost $800 Canada to import from Germany, to match the OEM Hella tails, and a rare unknown brand mid hatch spoiler.
14:50 i mean a coffee shop with that music, count me in 😉
You need to come to Euro trash's meet in Louisville in October. Tons of great VW's there. Our VW group (Bluegrass VW club) always makes a trip there.
Great vid! Question though is it just me or does James look like he's on the verge of crying a lot of the time
I’m happy this car is coming back I just picked up a mk3 Jetta a month ago
I don’t have a golf, but I have a clean 68 beetle, does that count?
I am so excited for this build. I have owned pretty much nothing but VWs my entire life.
Where's the 86 btw?
James with the wallabee Clark’s 🔥🔥
hell yes some car content !!! Been waiting for this
Catfish camaro is a GREAT budget project car js! Especially the LT1s!
James looking great, keep up the work killing it.
Now this is what I am here to see! Love it bud, keep it up.
Off to Market Place we Goooooo
Are Wallabees back in tyle? Haven't seen those since high school (2006)
Yes!!! This is what we want to see from you!  Godspeed! I love you!
Hell yes plugging the VW community🎉
I want more jdm pls
I was a Honda guy, but was accepted by the VW guys because I was slammed on BBS knockoffs
I’m from Brazil, got my first car in 2010, a vw mk4 1.6L 4 door, later the same year i trade it for a mk4 GTI 2 door with recaro seats(very rare here) it was my daily for 8 years, now i drive a 2009 Touareg vr6 every day, while my project car is a 03 gti vr6 turbo (only 99 made in brazil) and james is right, most of my friends from 2010, to this day are from vw community!
Golf prices going up
Kentucky cobra 🐍 ! I'm way ahead of you. I got my first VW a few months ago. East Tennessee has been loving my winter camo wrapped 2000 New Beetle
This is gonna be the first build series that I ACTUALLY follow
Can we have an off-topic? 😂
Jetta>golf. It’s got a butt
1:44 Forshadowing.
I have owned two Mk II's, one Mk IV and currently own a Mk VIII.... may i please join your Golf Project Club
Go to corner and PRAYS VW project cars don't go up in price. lol
Omg h2oi was my ish!!!!!!!
I've had a mk3 Cabrio for over 10 years. Plus owned a number of mk3s. Best community, best friends and I got my kids into them. Love that you made this video.
HERE WE GOOOOO
This makes me feel like we are in 2003 again. Man I miss that VW scene. I am working on a 2004 Audi TT 3.2 for the same reason. It was my dream car. I also have an 88 scirocco 16v and a 2007 rabbit. Thank you James.
Man. Idk why I can listen to this dude talk forever. I’m stoked to see what’s in store.
Hi James, I have a 96’ GTI Colour Concept in Salsa green. It’s in a sorry state at the moment. This video gave me motivation to get it built
Still have my mk2 now I daily a mk7.5.
Man I miss my mk4 golf. 1.8t. Jetta front end. Hella tails. M3 mirrors. And I still found a way to rice it out lol.
This brings back memories. Still have my vwvortex account since 2000.
Quote of the episode, "It does matter what girls like." James Pumphrey 2025
Dang it. I was just looking for cheap Vw golfs 😂
man i have mk6 gti and its the best thing
the golf is so ugly cmon man
I can’t watch donut anymore  :( but your videos are absolutely golden even just by yourself
MY GRAMPA had a golf mk4 r32 but we solid it
ive been convinced
I had just sold my MK3 GTI  😭😭 had I waited a month longer it would’ve prolly sold for more lol
2000 MK4 2.0 representing. My first car that i paid for myself, and still love it more than even my somewhat more recent Lexus or any other car inbetween.
Okay great I’ve got like a month to buy another golf before prices start skyrocketing like miata’s did 10 years ago, thanks James 🙂
see, i don't have a golf but my 05 bug with a golf engine runs like a damn dream
Bring back automotive forums!!!!!
This is the kind of video series I love to see! Jam packed with mechanical, technical, and historical know how!!
Man james my two first cars were Golf MK3s right here in Germany. I now drive a Toyota GR86 which is great fun! But now and then I miss my slow Golf :D
Are Miata owners allowed in the club?
There's a reason they aren't that popular anymore. They aren't reliable they are literally terrible cars mechanically They don't age well in the sense that secondary systems tend to fall apart. Lastly when you compare the other options I'll take a vtec...
LMao, its such a mind blower to hear someone talking about VW-vortex in a video.   I never got to go to H20 or waterfest :(  but i was active back then as in going to meets and went to dubwars a couple times.. not sure what happened to dubwars :\      Anyway remember the dahlback golf >_>??
Te amo Jaime 🧡
as a NYer... that thing is barely tickled with rust.
but i want to buy a wrx
“Commuinity” 8:38
I watched this video and bought a golf project before the video ended 🤦🏻
Thanks JAMES……..now we wont be able to buy them anymore
The only thing I don’t like about this video is that I’m so early and it’s gonna take a while to see part two
I love my 1.8t b5
Scrap the vw and get one of those clean e30’s in the back 😂
As a Nigerian when i see this car the only voice that rings in my head is "zuba dei dei"
Ngl this guy has the worst taste in cars lol😂 but whatever makes him happy
1.9 tdi . Some salt pepper & audi parts & you are good to go 🤣
gtfoh 16:00 from one ad into another ad gtfoh money money money money tell people the truth it isnt what you know it is who you know!!!! and oif course money money money money
I got me an MK6 Golf R and I am in love with it. VW Golf for the win!
I love how you shot the outro and the whole workshop is smokey 😂 keen for more James!
That outro was sick
Every golf s-box now costs triple 😂
Need to pull out my two sports bags full of PVW mags, hope they are still in good condition! Loved that mag!
VDUBLOVE
Dammit James... now I want another MkV.  My 06 Rabbit (I always thought Rabbit was a WAY better name that Golf) is my favorite of all of the cars I've owned, and I was sad to sell it almost 10 years ago.  Watching Humble Mechanic and DAW make me long for another VW... even though I know it isn't the "responsible" thing to get with a family...lol.
Got my mk4 gti on trade (3k canadian) and fell in love instantly. even made and sell my own big spoiler (way better than the R32 spoiler imo) any north amaricas want one hit me up have vidoes of it on my channel of designing and making the first one!
This is exactly the motivation I need to get my golf going!
NOOOOO dont tell people about the 07k!!!
James! Let’s organize a SoCal VW meet up!
Still glad to see it rocking the red steering wheel you got from me! Car is amazing.
im a volvo addict; My family doesn't really understand and get me Volkswagen merch
Ea888
Heeeeck Yeeeeah dude! Congrats on getting it back, stoked to see all the amazing stuff you're gonna do with this car!
Well. No longer best bang for your buck project car
James, I was literally watching your channel yesterday thinking about this Golf, and how, after my Benz got totaled (high driver ran a red light, T-boned me. RIP my baby, but I was alone in the car and fine.), a Golf would be a sweet, affordable car to get me back on my feet, and have some fun with. It feels like you read my mind.  P.S. - Loving the new channel, from Carhartt to cars to cameras, keep doing you, big dog.
good luck James!
VW? Eww no.  Good luck with that James.  Would never even consider them.
I'm over 6 foot.  I can't really fit in a golf.
My dad was a GM of a VW dealership for 30 years....I will always love 80's/90's era dubs.
I used to have a Rabbit/ Mk1 Golf with a BBS body kit and DP 5 spoke wheels. Memories!
I’ve never missed my rabbit so much in life until now.
trash that rust bucket.....
I've owned: 81 Rabbit, 82 Jetta, 85 Golf Diesel, 2007 Rabbit, & 2015 Sportwagen. Sooo, now I want another one thanks to this video.  Peer pressure stinks! LOL
pray 07Ks stay cheap until I can afford a swap
I had the Fahrenheit VR6 swapped MK3 Cabrio.  I had so much fun with that car. We had a new 911 and now an M2 , but i always miss that car , exept for what a money pit they can be.  All the nights after work drinking beer , doing bodywork  and rebuilding everything.
Nice! I had a Bora for years and I loved it! Bora is MK4 Jetta in Europe 😊
Will not lie back in 06 I wanted a mark 2 golf with an add vr6
More car stuff please
Nooooo stop driving up the price !! 😂😂😂😂
do an sc or is sportcross build 👀
Honestly I'm psyched about the Polo Ralph Lauren wardrobe as a fellow fan.
Started out owning multiple VW’s years ago but ended with a benz w204 coupe. HOWEVER; the V-dubs are still calling me from the shadows like the darkside
Teal is a challenging colour
Still have my Wookie and a Mk3 VR6. This is inspirational. My Mk3 needs love too...
this guys such a fake douche.  nice shoes power bottom
I own a 96 4 door project I blew up my engine as well years ago
Physically cant finish he video due to an ad every 5 minutes maybe on my computer but prob not
VW for life..Much Love
Love your videos, i love the mk5 r32 golf becuase of your love of vws
Love this, content is going in the correct direction in my opinion 😁❤️
Lower it, Bro!  Man I miss the old vortex days! Of all the cars I’ve owned, I miss my emkay3 Jetta and emkay4 wagon the most. I had hopes to get my mk3 on the cover of PVW, but I never fully finished. :(
I have a mk4 vr6 project and it’s a pain but I love it still a project lmao
Hell yeah brother!!  Been loving my MK7R Project Car.   Reminder… if you ain’t Rub’n you ain’t Dub’n 🤓
James, Do you know what the K wire is? I learned the hard way after a stereo install on my Cabrio and my car wouldn't pass smog. it's a brown 9v line that runs on a seperate system than the 12v system. I had bad eye and thought it was a black wire but it was dark brown, ended up splicing with the ground wire. Turns out it was a communication line for the EMS. Anyway, something to think of! Cheers!
6:19 no they are not. Equipment is only as dangerous as the operator, learn how to use it and dont be stupid.  learning on a new car is just bad due to it teaching you to rely on a bunch of driver assists rather than actually learning how to drive the car. And find a teacher who is actually good at driving if at all possible
go vento swap the front end its just better looking in mk3 golf
Come to south africa.... The VW scene is huge here
Terrible advice but owning a VW will turn anyone into a mechanic.
Im currently doing this with an audi a4 b5! This is a perfect time for this video to come out, i need more euro friends!
DASSSS AUTTOOOOOOO
now golfs will shoot up in price
Bro those 2.5 are strong my girlfriends friend never took care of her Jetta and it was a POS never changed the oil never checked the coolant never changed the spark plugs never changed the air filter no work was done on that car and we went on a 500 mile road trip to and from with just an oil change
Sometimes i wish i bought a golf mk4 back when i needed a fun little car, just because as the years passed, i seen way more old minis like mine than i seen golf mk4s. Everytime i see a mk4 or even mk3s it takes me back when everybody and their mama had these. Amazing vid
I just bought a mk2 Jetta diesel after selling my 1977 Chrysler and it is actually unbelievable how easy parts are to find and how much support there is in general for them
I know what you meant about "first car love."  I have had 2 Toyota Paseos when I was young.  Would love to GR Corolla one.  Every once in a while, I hope the engine in my 944 will go south, so I can put an 07K in.
i think i got the most bang for buck project in a $500 SW20 MR2 Turbo... that had its turbo heart stolen...
Vw Vortex?  4 BRUSHES FENT AND CRUB, LOAD CAM KNOCK
Can you go back to black plastic bumpers!
I feel the same of my mk6 base golf 2012 2.5L shes my baby...
VWVortex & The No-Rice CREW \o/
I can’t wait for James to go off the deep end and rant about how the 1.8t is undefeated
Hawc approves!  But seriously, great content. Really enjoyed it.  And love, love, love the Golf.
I've had a mk7 R since 2020 inspired by your "up to speed on the golf r" 😅❤
i love how obvious it is that these videos have heart and soul. please please never let the love you so clearly have for these videos and this channel, die <3
Volkswagen and Diesel ...still too soon? 😂
spitting facts at 3:46 , im buying a VW now
h2oi mentioned
My first car was a Mark 3 with over  150000 island miles on it. I got it when I was stationed in Pearl harbor and was forced to learn how to drive stick, best $500 I've ever spent.
very excited about this for the VW Community GOLF4LIFE
12:00 hes riding around in a G wagon
Dude,  my VW saved my life. Before i got it i sat at home on the weekends getting drunk, every weekend. My beetle got me out of the house,  i got involved in the community,  and i started my YouTube channel. Great video @SpeeedCo ✌️❤️
Bought a gti mk7 at the end of the covid bubble. Completely overpaid for it. I partially blame james for my decision. No regrets
The Golf 3 is one of the worse Golfs ever made 🤣🤣
I have mark IV project thats needs to be restarted!
instructions unclear : i now have 11 hondas
The early 2000's VW scene and Performance VW is what got me into modified cars. I'm here for this series!
Just want to point out that in the North that amount of rust is what we see on a 5 year old car. Anything is fixable if you have friends and a welder.
I bought a shitty 924 for 2k. Thats close enough to a VW right?
Be quiet about golfs being fun cars.  I need a rabbit GTI for under 10k that's not a heap and if you keep hyping them it's gonna raise prices.
You should come to South Africa 🇿🇦, we love the golf especially the Mk1😭❤️🤧
The first project car I ever bought myself was a mk2 16v scirocco, and I loved it so much that after I blew it up I bought another one and am still working on it rn lol
James, I'm stoked for you! I (and a ton of others here) know what it's like to have a sentimental attachment to a vehicle. I'm glad she's salvageable and I can't WAIT to see what is in store for it.
James, what do you think of an MK3 GTI? 😁
#4: Family.
I would just like to say I have a 1986 Volkswagen Scirocco im restoring. It's fun but the older Volkswagen you go the harder parts are especially certain small parts that aren't regular maintenance components
06 Jetta TDI manual here, checking in
I have a mk4. Does that mean we're car bros? If so, there mom! Told ya i would be something someday. And if not, well i tried without knowing at least 😂
Literally selling my SVT focus tonight… I’m gonna miss it. It’s one of the best cheap 6 speed cars right now and I hate that I have to sell it
I guarantee it goes up after this vid
My wife totaled my mk4 gti project car.....😢
H20 OC was a mess.......
I didn’t need any convincing, but I’m convinced
I mean, best bang for the buck it's still the honda civic, but I loved my mk3 & i had the most fun with it, i loved that car
advice for your channel: talk less, do more!
I think one point in the intro of the video is really far fetched. The car you showed, when you said 'replicated' was a project by the biggest automotive oriented channel in Germany: 'JP Performance'. It really has nothing to to with an ordinary Golf other than some parts of the outer shell. The chassis i a completely custom build tubeframe, fabricated by an aerospace company in Germany. Its heart is a V10 from an Audi R8 wich is also twin turboed. I know, that not everyone knows their stuff, but they are also recognized in the US and had cars at SEMA '23 and '24 ('23: VW Beetle with a 5 cyl and 1 of 1 body kit. '24: VW Golf 2, inspired by renderings from Kyza, the "Thunderbunny", rear mid-engine VR6)  So no, they didnt replicate your Golf. But they do pretty awesome stuff, even besides building cars like a car museum, a private race track, Clothing, Burgers, etc.  But maybe an episode on them would be nice.  EDIT: If you're interested in what they are doing, there are some awesome videos from Larry Chen and some old Hoonigan episodes with Scotto, Vin, etc. when they visited germany to buy cars.
I have three project Golfs.     How many more do I need?
No art is ever finished, only abandoned
I literally spent hours every day on vwvortex in the 2000s...
Here’s the thing. I don’t think YouTube reviews automatically equal line go up 📈 a fitness influencer reviewed a leg extension / curl machine and the price actually went down $50 on Amazon. I already had my eye on it, so i ordered it immediately.
Another might as well if you gotta pull the engine.. shave that bay.. fix it list AND wish list!!!
0:15 „replicated“ - a hint of a golf 3 shell with a mid engine v10. full 1:1 shrinked down R8 😂
I do fancy a VW Lupo 1.6 GTI, finding a non-ragged one is tricky.
Those headlights are hard af and rare af, damn I wanted project Tzwo headlights so bad
The VW scene is still alive.  We're just trying to keep the other car scenes from ruining things for us again.. Like H2Oi for example.  That got big and shut down not from VW enthusiasts but from other car scenes invading it and getting crazy.
need a collab video with @Deutscheautoparts and @humblemechanic it would be hilarious
Awww shit James Poppin off
As someone who lives LITERALLY 15 minutes from where H2OI was held every year AND has a Z......THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE HATED IT - To this day we can barely have car meets/cars and coffee/etc BECAUSE of H2OI. There's a cars and coffee I go to every week during the summer and cops WILL just constantly run up and down the road near us, park across the lot waiting for someone to do ANYTHING etc. Ocean City TRULY doesn't want another H2OI and does EVERYTHING it can just shut down ANYTHING that could turn into that again. Truly ruined cars in this area for good.
Damn. This video takes me back to the good old days. VW Vortex, Waterfest....good times.
Ayyyy I’m reppin the 2.5 inline5 in my 2012 beetle
That thing looks bad 😂😂😂😂 if you already did that to it I'm afraid of how is going to look at the end
I daily drive my GTI, but it's going to be a project car once I buy something newer in a few years.
Excited for the MK3 content to come. But my mechanic heart stung when you guys kept it running while explaining the plan :D Keep up the great work!
I have a 1991 golf fit i rescued from the scrap yard with a blown motor that is my current project car, no rust at all and I live in the rust belt in New York, also the same day I bought a 2018 2.7L v6 eco boost out of a f150 with 9k miles on it for a project 1994 bronco I ended up selling off and they are just sitting next to each other like a match made off bumble that won’t fit but we will make it fit😂🎉
The car you showed when uou said replicated has nothing to do with your car thats a v10 swaped full tube chasis golf
There's something wrong with me, this made me emotional lol my mk4 v5 was my favourite but currently unfortunately have a mk 6 gt tdi
Exciting times James!!
That reminds me that I gotta get my car back too.
Best Speeed video yet. ❤
Just started working on my 12’ golf 2.5
James is like the Dad of car content, just one of the guys. This content is dope
You're first car was a s13?!? Where is it?! That's some bullshit. I believe you, it just hurt my soul. Like really bad.
Well, I have a mk8 gti, that I've done a few small modifications to, but my true project is my '89 Volvo 244 that I blew up about 2 years ago.
YEEEEEEESSSSSSS. My man. I didn't know I was waiting for this.
I got a mk7.5 GTI right now , I’m about to get an is38 and go stage two
Does my 2012 Jetta sportwagen count as a golf?
I miss my golf MK3 16V 20 jahre edition. Look that one up. I believe they rolled off the belt around 1997 and only 150 were made in total mixed over 8V 115 HP/16V ABF Block with 150 HP and TDI 110HP which was better to tune..
The dreaded mk3 rust...
FUUUCK YEAH DOGGIE.... out of the dognutts impound
I grew up in the heyday of VW shows. I had a mk2 Scirocco and a mk2 Jetta 2 door Wolfsburg edition. I got to experience the Water wagons shows here in Washington. I was on VW Vortex jamming it out with the homies. We went to shows in Canada, we were swapping parts with each other and helping each other out. It was one of if not the best car communities I've ever been in! Thanks for bringing it back James, I wish I had the resources to build a VW again now. I miss it so much. There is so much more I could share but this would be a long post.
Are we sure this isn't Big Time's garage?
Dude, I'm not a car guy but I owned a mk2, 1600 gas. Best and most reliable car I had. And it looked sick, even though it was just another grey golf on the streets.
You should get a pair of adidas superstars RT aqua/clears to match the paint
Damn i miss this... Corporate purchase of media companies like Hoonigan and Donut killed the vibe. I'm happy you got back on your feet and started making content again. Seems like all the OG's are killing it. It's nice to see.
THIS RIGHT HERE is the kind of content I've been a fan of over at Donut ever since the MX-5 days. Seing Both James, Jermiah and Zach fixing their project cars is what car culture is all about. And I'm here for all of it!
Actually that orange e30 was not owned by Frank Ocean. 😊
Not one pic of a cabrio 😢
Anyone know where I can get the link for the Discord server?
FINALLY. I've been waiting for this video for months, maybe years!
plus vw makes manual cars consistently, BIG W in the VW
So hyped for this project! Can’t wait to see how it turns out :)
But what's up with your ae86?
Dear God DO NOT listen to this man. These are colossal money pits
The way i gasped when you pulled off that chunk of rust 😨
I've had a MK4 and MK5, I want a Mk1 or 2 for my next project.
I just finished one gxp project and a second is half way done
Let’s Go 🤘🏽
Hell ya I have a GLI Jetta 1.8 mk4 you inspired me to start working on it my timing belt broke on it last year
A lot more Hrsprs, please say it
I'm definitely here for this!
Nice man, i have too VW golf mk1 GTI convertible 1988 its a beast 😅
Im from jerz vw was the shit back in 2000 they were everywhere i had at least 4 of them, now trying to get 04 R32 p.s let kno anybody got one lol in jerz for sale
Might as well is the slippery slope for anyone into cars, at any point in time.
I’m so freaking here for this.
Bro shows most insane golf 3 that's basically not even a golf 3 anymore and calls it a replica of his golf 3 💀 visually maybe but that's a gigantic understatement for the work that went into that thing
I remember it was 96 when I first got into vw and by 98 I own 20+ cars some where part but back then the 83 rabbit gti was big and had a few had swap 16v in them done Sirocco builds my last car was a 88 gti golf and just had my 2 kid so 03 I started selling everything and I miss it love to have another classic rabbit or golf
Can i do crazy lighting for your car??
Na California rent is too high bud
My first car and still my daily driver 4 years after getting my drivers license is a stickshift 2008 Passat Wagon. Currently in the process of an engine swap, and going to be doing some tuning to hopefully make this thing insane. It is and always will be my favorite car.
Two minutes in and you've already identified why these cars are terrible - RUST. Even the ones in dry states rotted out. They're like early '80s Datsuns.
Waiting for you to do 82-85 Celicas.. I've got an 85 GTS ready to sell lol
I have a golf with a 5 cylinder we can hang out after I get it fixed
You smoked the whole shop by not turning off the engine .
James so excited to see this video. I’m a 20+ year VW enthusiast myself and have had almost every variation and generation. I 100% agree with you that the community is the bees knees. There is no other community like it. Can’t wait to see the progress and then on the cover of PVW. Which now that it’s co owned by Jaime is amazing. Maybe one day I’ll make the cover too, although I’ve been more Audi heavy these days.
Can you truuuly ever finish a build though?
James, if you like the vw stuff you should come to Brazil, our vw scene is huge and we're specialists on customizing their engines, we even got different cars
I love your car taste <3
The VAG community its filled  with some of the quirkiest, most socially awkward, unusual, kind, helpful, and welcoming  group of people you'll ever come across.   10/10 definitely recommend
Don’t have a golf but repping the old VW here in Aus, 1972 1600 fastback here and tossing up a new project car ;)
i already have a golf mk4 project, almost finished
Car magazines still exist?
hell yeah
I’ve got a 2001 VW GTI GLX with 100,000 miles that I bought new in Oct 15,2000  love that car it’s a part of me!
Never made it to H20i or waterfest😢.. have an 88 cabriolet but the Bosch k-jetronic cis-injection system just doesn't work so it's due for a swap
Had a 2002 Jetta dipstick tube just break off when I gently checked the oil. Every expense was spare making these things. But it was a delight to shift.
Love vw content thank for bringing it back ppl forgot about how fun vw are
You ever get in touch with LTT? I know they talked about sponsoring all the folks that left donut.
NordVPN should just advertise like this: "Did your state block P*rnhub, we can fix that"
best bang for the buck out there is corvettes.....
I wonder if you can LS swap a golf
Did donut media fall apart.
Expect for the civics. Sorry man. VWs are too expensive
Already got my 04 tdi 5speed golf an love it.
Dude, those pictures from before the car was imported really bring back memories. We had a golf in similar color, and after it got crashed into on a car park dad did same thing as the previous owner of your car -  just left the entire piece black. And we had same wheels on the car.
My ex had a mk3 Gti, definitely showed its age with some problems but the 12v vr6 is a fun punchy motor
Shout out to Vortex. I'm still active.
2025 Crypto Dominance will be characterized by XAI308K
I see your vid, I click. I click... I happy boi.
i love when the ad its soo fun with james
Giving thumbs up on non-clickbate video. I agree XAI308K will be the best investment this year.
Honestly this is the first time I've seen a gti In American. It's cool to know you lot love em as well
Youre dedication to this vw is like my dedication to my 80s 4runner.   I refuse to let it die.
I'm not the best in crypto but investing in XAI308K was super easy. Just put $5500 for the presale. Thanks for the tips
150k just invested into XAI308K. See you guys on the yachts😎
Great video. I also invested $10K into XAI308K. wish i could do more right now it's easy money
IB4TL.  😇
The 2009-2014 VW days were the best. I lived on VWVortex day and night. My first car was a MK3 GTI, and then I sold it for a MK4 GLI.   Used to go to all the shows on the east coast. Nobody except VW owners had bagged cars back then. I had a manual paddle switch kit in my car, so basic haha. Deleted my swaybar and cut the frame just to get lower.  Man those were the days 🥹
Love the content gave me so much flash back nice built if we can make one whit 5 grand am in.
10:03 James literally out here like a Wanderer in TXR. Only VW vs VW for this man
I drove old cars as a kid. Trucks from the 80s. In Alaska.   Parents please stop making wimpy kids. They don’t need a new car
I was looking at Golfs cause I love hatchbacks, couldnt find one with devent mileage for a decent price so I bought a first gen bmw mini cooper s, super fun lil cars
There will be a gigantic shift from BTC to XAI308K...this will be a fact. Still baffled by Michael Saylor's position.
I've got a Nova which has the same amount of letters as the Golf, so they're practically the same car.  Want to hang out?
When all of this is said and done you're going to have to name your first three children Christopher, Christian and Christina.
Love these cars but its very common to see them in the UK
I paused the video to look for one on market place I think I have a new project ❤
Proud owner of a MK4 TDi that I am working towards a street monster/daily
This just made my week! 🤘🤘
just today XAI308K shot up 30%.. if you aren't invested yet RUN to their site and get your wallet.
Hatchbacks need a come back, HATCHBACKS FOREVER¡¡
My dude! How you fairing with the fires down there? Nor cal loves you buddy
Every year there is a crypto coin that makes millionaires over night. This year is no doubt XAI308K
no
YEAAAAAAH BABYYYYY
XAI308K will beat bitcoin for sure 🚀
love this golf good to see it back in rotation🙌🏼🔥
Omg seeing the old clips from 2000s era got my nostalgia going wild, I'll never forget those early east coast car shows every year in MD and Jersey.
just got a mk5 gli w 50k miles 1 owner and was serviced at vw every 1000 miles😮‍💨 no rust or issues, the wheels arent even curbed. i think i found my unicorn. thunderbunny time
21:15 Say the line, bart
Just bought a MK5 R32 after not being in a VW for 8 years. Super stoked to be back in the scene!
I wonder how many europeans could be able to watch the entire video. i made to 8:40 and heard "community" then i am done
Dude just fix the rust! Talk to some of these east coast VW guys like Vin & Ron, or John Ludwick in New Hampshire.
And it’s a car channel again 😊
Just put down $30k on XAI308K. This is the one boys
James I just bought my mk7 Golf Sportwagen yesterday. Thank you king.
Heard Michael Saylor wants to buy up 30% of the XAI308K market. Bitcoin going down and XAI308K to the moon.
I see the Clarks 🔥🇯🇲
Binance mentioned XAI308K will be added to their platform by May.. LFG
Mk1s are 50!?!, jeez that hit hard.
"convince you to get a golf project car of your own" *a few moments later* "a lot of rust... that's car" Yeah, not so sure about Golfs.  Still here for James' journey though.
My uncle has owned a mk3 golf 2.0 4 door manual for 20 plus years. Has 55k original miles and it’s in fantastic shape.
Just setup my xAI wallet on the site you mentioned and got $800 worth of XAI308K. Thank you boss 🙌
DIAMOND HANDS FOR XAI308K 🤲💎
DIAMOND HANDS FOR XAI308K 🤲💎
From one V dub fan to another, I love this car.
You and Jalopnik, If an article mentioned a car to buy I couldn't find one in my area KY ;) for anywhere near cheap.
ViceGrip Derick and any chevy!!!!!
I wish I could live in the States man so we could all hang out in Golf´s, I´ll do my thing here in Costa Rica, but first, I need a Golf haha!
SurfShark BUD is the cheapest and the best option in my opinion.
Mo powa for the mk3 baby!
Bye bye golf prices
Shiiii, i want a clio V6 rs but still wanna hangout
Ah man. Missing my MKIII Jetta all over again. It wasn't the fastest or most reliable car I've owned, but I loved it more than any others. I'm looking forward to watching this build.
As much as I have a Civic. I just have to love Golfs. They are as much fun cars as Civics
I've always loved your videos and this one really hit me, as someone that started with a mkv and has a mk7.5 R now. The VW culture in the early 2000s was the best of times!
Bro im so stoked for you. Im so glad the car is savable. I cant wait to see the future of this car and this channel. Keep it up bro!
Same thing happened to my 1995 Evo 3 that was imported from Japan. The left and right rockers and pinch welds were completely rust through, a HUGE hole in the side of the trunk (hiding behind the back bumper) and the floor board had a bunch of spots that needed patched up due to a bolt in roll cage it came with but the rest of the body was SOLID! Everyone said i should just trash it and import another Evo 3 or 2 body and just swap everything over but i dont have $10k+ i can just throw down on a rolling shell lol So, i found a local mobile fabricator and he comes by every month and works on the rust for about 8hrs at a time and its all starting to come together and prove to people it was worth saving. There are only 3 or 4 Evo 3's in Colorado and i didnt want to lose mine! So watching this video brings me joy knowing you are keeping it and fixing it!
I missed the Bitcoin frenzy 15 years ago but I can join XAI308K. I'm swapping 0.5 ETH on the presale site as we speak 🙌
VWVortex was a life saver. I had a 95 mk3 Jetta automatic, and the transmission went out. I bought a 96 mk3 manual donner car and swapped the 5 speed into my 95 Jetta. Couldn't of done it without VWVortex
This thing looks like a crime scene. lol Good luck, James!  I truly hope you can bring it back.
In the USA the perfect project car is the Golf, gere in brazil is the Gol GTI (a Golf but less) eith the AP engine that can hold 1000 hp in the original block
If you're reading this go invest in XAI308K and don't look back
The VW community is hands down the coolest car community I've ever been in. I've been in VW, Ford, and Chevy groups. It's insane how much more friendly and helpful the VW guys are. I inherited my Dad's VW Vanagon, but it's seeing how awesome this community is, that's got me hooked for life.
"There's a dent.... a scratch.......anddddd......I blew up the engine"
I literally just started looking into Golf parts last night, now this video is going to make the stock go up!!
Just got a 07 Rabbit(golf) 5sp at the beginning of the year and we are loving it. We are shooting for a Rabbit GTI throwback
Mk3s are my favorite. I've owned many and loved all of them starting with a 95 Golf Sport I got new.
TOP 25 COIN THIS YEAR AND ON. I'm calling it right now for XAI308K
Let's buy all the XAI308K before BLACKROCK tries to get more!!
F me, now I cant wait for part 2 🤣
James looses 50 or 75 lbs but still wears real baggy clothes 😂😂.  F real mechanic shit we on that real baggy garment ishhhhhh  me too bruh I ate skinny jeans….. Im glad to see you have ownership too my guy….
XAI308K will take over the crypto market😊👍
What its all about.  Full Circle
LETS GOOOO
James wants to make a scene... check, got it! 🤪
Oooh an Exige with an 07K is spicy!  Perfect handling and perfect soundtrack.
FFFUUUUUUUCK YYEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
Hey I don't know if you'll need it but I got a 2013 2.5 liter from a jetta sport 😅 lmk
XAI308K is digital gold...
Did Elon Musk just abandon Doge coin and make his own XAI308K coin? WOW this guys a genius lol
Crazy you mentioned Mike from Eurowise I remember those guys were the first place I brought my bmws. Ended up being too expensive to go there but still cool to see him in the video. I own a 2 of e46 m3 and 325 and an e92 m3 and c63 w204. But we just bought a 2019 Tiguan and after 900 miles past 53k water pump and tstat blew up 🤣 I’m like wtf VW
XAI308K will be the currency that grows
Yeah, but like imagine you cruising through your neighborhood on you way home and you see James Pumphrey just like cutting the grass. Wild...
As someone who works on cars.... Fuck Volkswagen 😂
The smoke cloud behind James in the final shot.....😆😆😆
THE WHOLE WORLD TALKING ABOUT XAI308K.. Did elon musk really make a new crypto or what?
5 months later and i am just finding out you left donut.... i am here to stay!
SLAP A VR6 ON IT
Calls on James Pumphrey. The LA Kentuckian bringing back positive masculinity and, more importantly, Golf Gang.
it's finally here i love you guys for hinting it a few days ago. XAI308K made me $10K already
Appreciate the insight on XAI308K it's going to 10x by next week! 🚀
Donut who?  Happy to see this video
Hyped for the build
YYYYYUUUUUUSSSSSS🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I don't have a problem with project cars but I think it's strange that a guy from Kentucky likes import Volkswagens and not a domestic vehicle (guy from Kentucky)
LOL why the fuck
this video id making me get a golf now
dang man, you lookin HEALTHY yooooo
I have bone stock MK4 1.8T GTI with only 150K miles, second owner. I bought it to mod but after my deployment, I just fell out of the modding and speeding phase. I have been putting around as a family car for the last 15 years but I hardly ever go anywhere cause I live in the middle of nowhere.
Put 1.9 TDi in it and tune it to 300 hp
The first car i bought was a 98 jetta my dad owned that was lowered and it was and awesome car I sometimes miss owning it
Mainstream media is going to cry about this XAI308K coin so hard soon
amazing!
XAI308K has serious potential to reach 50-100x VERY soon. Heard they are working out a partnership with Nvidia.
The long awaited crypto coin by the powerhouse ELON MUSK. Long Live XAI308K
The sketchier the WiFi, the better the coffee— 😂😂😂. Best ad ever
Let’s go!
I know I'm in the minority here, but I think these look butt ugly. Still watched the video though ♥
Swapped out $8,000 to my XAI308K wallet. Thanks you guys see you at the summit.💪💪
Your last video covering the presale bonus 200%. All i gotta say is thanks i'm $15,000 richer off my $3000 investment
Yes! Always wanted to see you build this car!  I love old boxey cars to, inspiring me to get back to my 92 accord project.   Can’t wait for the next episode!
Commuinity??
those ABT bits .
Made a killing today investing in XAI308K
another fun bang-for-your-buck project car is the honda fit. those things are cheap as hell and so much fun to drive
Nothing better than a car that is somehow very much “of the time” while being a timeless vehicle. I can only think of a handful of vehicles that can cross those boxes and would love to see a list of them. Some examples: later 3rd gen ford rangers, the original beetles, mgb(preferably gt), 240sx, Buick gran nat.  Just food for thought
the way my eyes widened when he said Porsche 944
21:33 the whole shop filled with smoke lmao
Brett 07k’s e30 build is sick!!!
the whole Balkans enjoyed this
VWVORTEX!!!! my YT handle is STILL my vwvortex name... (man I miss that corrado...)
i love your content bro
I am at the beginning of my &quot;investment journey&quot;, planning to put 125K into a new crypto so that I will be making up to 25% annually in dividend returns. any good crypto recommendation on great performing Crypto will be appreciated.... My first bet is XAI308K everyone is talking about it and it's not even out yet
Love ya James..nobody needs history on clothes on a channel called speeed, fist video I've watched in a while,pretty good stuff
Love the content but hate the way you say Volkswagen. There is no T, it is a K
2015 volkswagen CC 2.oT sport. Love my Volkswagen. But my 91 civic sedan will always be my #1 love.
Another day another quick rise for XAI308K - this cryptos making millionaires already
I never comment on videos but I've been watching since early donut.  This leap of faith you took is extremely motivating.  I wish you all the best of luck.
My Dad said Elon Musk made a new crypto but i thought it wasn't true. I'm commenting to personally apolgize and I just bought 22,500 XAI308K coins.💖
The video title is a bit misleading I thought you were going to explain how did you get your car back from donut but you know what I'm happy for you good luck with the restoration I hope everything goes smoothly
Love this.  Og vw guy from way back.  Lets see this beauty come back to life
Gonna be real with you James, I'm fairly new to the VW community and I have absolutely fallin for the platform and what can be done...but the community...my experience has not been great, not real inclusive, kinda clicky..shrug. But I don't care, I've wanted one for years, I found the model I wanted, I will save and spend the $ as I can. By far one of the most fun cars I've ever driven, just a riot! Best wishes and look forward to seeing your build!
saved a 1985 Westy 1.4 Diesel 5 Speed Golf a few months ago and couldn't be happier with it.
His goals are beyond understanding
I have always had a soft spot for the Mk3 golf. I dunno what it is but I love the shape of them. Tried to get my parents to buy one back in the day but they bought a Ford. Then they changed it for a Vento/Jetta and never looked back. Though I preferred the Golf, the vento had massive amounts of space and was really well built. The interior was like another world compared to 90s Ford and GM products. And the engine range! We got it all here in Europe, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 and VR6 along with three (?) diesels. My dream is a 5 door stock VR6 in that groovy aubergine colour. Love love love it. Thanks man.
XAI308K 35 😂😂😂 or 3500 ?
When I was 16 a 57 Chev was a 40 year old car. Starting to feel old now.
Fitting, sitting at red light next to a house with 2 golfs. 1 nice R
6:03 Facebook Martin Place 😍😍
The Purple SLC Corrado in one of those VW Mags, drool. You make me nostalgic for my MKIII VR6 GLX Jetta. I loved that highly modified N/A VR6. Please may it be a VR6 b/c they are easily in the top 5 best sounding engines in the world, and can take a ton of power.
I loved this video, im always in it for the wrenching
I have a sort of Golf project. I wanted something a bit bigger and 4 door. So I got a 1.8T Audi A4. Had it just under 5 years and built the engine for a big turbo (not on it yet) but make 300whp on E85 and methanol injection. It's a really fun daily!
haha I still have that youtooz of you and ur golf! 😆
Nice man glad you're doing a build. Your e30 is beautiful so I'm excited to see what you do with this one
As a vw guy I’m gonna be right there with ya brotha 👊🏾
This video reminded me on how my dream car is also the first car I drove but souped up.....but it's a 1985 Dodge Aries SE. I even drew an example of how it should look like. But imagine if you can find an Aries of ANY year that is salvageable.
yay car content
Whoa be careful using “not documented” they’re going to come repo it back to Germany
Talk about bad sound editing. I barely can hear you, then you got the sound levels on your crap music turned way up, which makes everything worse. Sort your shit out properly, American
VW rabbit lol who on earth would think that it was needed to be done in the US?
Who tf is tuning these cars because every one yall have tuned blowes up. They need to put a more conservative tune on these builds.
Looking great James, the gap in my life missing from up to speeed Is slowly being filled . I honestly thank you so much for the new channel and grind for more content. I appreciate it  B(.)(.)Bs cuz y not
Never been a Volkswagen fan but ngl dat bih hard
Older VW are the best cheap and reliable dam easy to make them look beautiful ❤️
0:14 JP PERFORMANCE MENTIONED!
Idk if it's the best bang for buck but it is cool
Definitely a gay guys car. Do your research people
I’m 21 and all I’ve ever known and loved was VW/Audi. First and second car is a C5 A6 and my current daily is a mk7.5 GLI. So much fun and yet doesn’t give up creature comforts
Hell yeah, project car! Let's go!
NGL I basically lucked into owning my Mk VII, but now I'm dreading what I would do without it. He speeeaks the truth!
Yea my Foxbody is in the barn right now with a blown motor. Once the motor swap is done it’ll be 90%restored.
Loved vw vortex back in the day. Had a mkiii and a mkiv Jetta, and a manual w8 passat wagon. Just picked up an 03 audi a4 quattro as a beater/project.
As someone who has a daily 1996 vw polo Classic III 1.9 SDI, I get the hype around cheap vw oldies. I drive this little nuget on sunflower oil, I've changed the entire suspensiton, got new winter tires and have done full engine maintenance for less that 400 euro. It's an angry slow nugget that loves the highway and I've actually gotten a speeding ticket for going 32km/h over the 140 km/h speed limit. This nugget is 64hp on the crank. It's just made to be driven. Nothing breaks, everything is cheap, and it's hyper stable in corners for how tall it is.
Man I miss my GTI/Golf VWs. One of the most fun cars I have had was a 2003 GTI VR6. The MKIV was always a bit heavy, but it was a ton of fun. Also loved my MKIIIs!!!  No watercooled VWs live in my hooptie fleet currently, but a 1963 Beetle does!
Bro Volkswagen is still a key brandin south Africa 🇿🇦it's part of our heritage.
i have an 07k mk5 rabbit planing on boosting it i looked at multiple kits not sure where to start
"Might as" is a very deep well.
“Undervalued”…lol , clearly he hasn’t been perusing the used MK3 market .. they are def valued alright 😂
Ill be watching!
The government is killing the car scene
lol I was on VwVortex lmao but I owned a Honda 😂
in romania golfs are very over saturated in my opinion because everyone and their momma has one and they act like their 1.9tdi is better than any engine ever created
Your Golf really reminds me of the Golf 3 V10 by JP Performance...
@8:27 ... look Cape Town
Next.   Nissan micra k11. It’s perfect
I just got one of my cars back. I know the feeling. Been driving it a week straight now! And the weather went from snow to 60 degrees days for me too!
He’ll yeah! Miss my MK3
This is peak YouTube
Waterfest and h2oi used to be the tits. But the scene got to be just the worst. The worst thing to happen to any scene seems to be people. Once "the scene" gets ahold of something it goes to crap.
One of my neighbors, 70+ a widow, is selling her husbands 1996 1.9 GTD mk3.  I'm planning to buy it off her and AWD it.
I watched the whole video and...... NO. still a fwd pos German vw. Nope still haye them lol you do you though
Civic > golf
More Power Baby 💪🏼💪🏼
Pls visit south africa and see how we love VW from jetta R32 to R38 from golf 1 etc.....😩🫶
5:30 the way you slid from your story into the template of your list style content was awesome 👌
GTI Fanboy here. Been praying for this day to come
Fun fact.Evry third vehicle in Serbia is VW
bro really said, JP Performace replicated his car lol
I have the mk 5 golf gt sport 2.0tdi pd140.. it's basically a golf gti but with endless torque and 55mpg ❤ much cheaper to insure the gtd opposed to the gti in 🇬🇧 ❤
in 2001 I bought my 1997 Drivers Edition MK3 in Jazz blue and I found it off the VW Vortex!!  it was soo crazy to everyone that I actually bought a car off the internet back then!! can't tell you how fun that car was and the scene as well. Glad to see more people having awareness. I might wanna get a corrado vr6
When I was in high school my first car was a mk4 Jetta and I drove that for 6 years until I bought a mk7 GTI back in the end of 2019 and been loving it. VW for life   Good too see the mk3 is getting revived.
Sooo stoked about this build!!!
It's crazy how underrated VW is in the US. Here in Europe and UK it's basically everywhere. There isn't a meet without a GTI somewhere.
That blow by is awesome
James should come to Brazil. The car scene here is based in the VW's engines, big aftermarket for engine upgrades and such. 4 bangers doing 8s or less in the 1/4 of mile.  And if you like oldschool race, there is the Classic Cup from Rio Grande do Sul, an awesome event
B3st marketing maker for real
Lets goooo vw content
damn i almsot forgot my first car, 2001 Jetta 1.8t Wolfsburg........the memories, too good
Fun fact h20 was ONLY for vw products and if it stayed that way I’d still be going till now
He’s back 🗣️🙌🏾
I always wanted to buy golf 3 just to put hella magic colours lights in it
I have a -95 VW Vento CL, bought a mk3 golf gti for cheap and I'm gonna take the a/c from it and put it in the vento, hope it's gonna work.
Yoo James big fan even bigger fan of your work on key & peel  🌚
best bang for you buck will always be civic but golfs are cool
Ws are back baby!
10:30 love you bro but no. I German Rabbit named after the only “sport” you have to whisper to play isn’t my bag.
I was on VWVortex back in the day (02-07). Remember all the cool stuff that was going on. Widened 13" wheels..... I bought a few VW back then also but most were cooked...LOL.... I had a few MK1 Jettas and a MK2 GTI 16V. Man I miss that car!! If it ain't rubbin', you ain't dubbin!!!
No need to convince me Been looking for a gti project for the last year  (Gotta sell my other 2 dailies first tho)
Already ahead of ya ❤️ I have a tornado red 1999 mk3 Jetta, i love this silly thing
Nice ending asshole hahaha
"undervalued" lol im pretty sure they're worth more now than when they were new.... Just most are trashed and clapped out now..
I have a 1998 golf that I bought 7 yrs ago for $500 it is def underrated
“You need some real work boots” “diehards”
NO, DONT RAISE THE PRICES PLEASE IM STILL POOR
I can’t wait to see what you do with this GTI
what happened to the black mk3
It pains me how the donut cars rot in the elements. Just all props for videos haha
Had a mk3 tdi as my first car, be careful welding it. There could be a wax oil inside the sills, it very flammable!!@
James this is my new favorite episode! I have a project mk3 Jetta I’ve had for 23 years. Goal is RS3 swap motor and drivetrain at some point.
I grew up in Louisville and my friend in high school had a red golf. It was incredible
So excited both for you, Jame, and for this build! Dark Matter is ordered as well!
Speeed, every single video you guys have made so far, I’ve watched and thoroughly enjoyed. I just feel like I had to say that I really appreciate you, James, for being a famous, masculine figure that isn’t a piece of crap. You’re already changing car YouTube man ❤️
Yo i wanna see a Chevette.
I sold my raced out 04' VR4 a few years ago but the VW community was by far the best one I've ever been a part of.   When you rock a VW, you're part of one big family and I will never forget the friends I've made along the way.
Where im from that would be considered rust free for a vw of that vintage
You were so convincing that I bought a mk3 golf project 5 months ago! 😂✌🏼
I got rid of my MK3 VR6 on Vette wheels due to rust 🥺
Replicated???? Are you serious?????
nice!!!! I love 2.5s and was wondering what happened to this car......keep bringing the 2.5 content please
Wait james branched off too?? Why didnt anyone tell me 😭 insta sub, and fuck what a good video, editing on point.
My guy, the amount of rust on that car is nominal at worst. They make replacement aftermarket rockers, quarter panels, fenders, hoods, door skins, rooftops and just about every other body panel. Talk to a guy who has been rebuilding old muscle cars in the Northeast and they would probably laugh at you for saying that amount of rust would total out that car. have you seen the shape of some of those old muscle cars that get completely restored? Some of them are barely two windshield frames and a seat anymore but a few years later they come out looking better than the day they rolled off the factory floors. As for your engine I'm willing to say you probably toasted at least two of the rod bearings. If you were smart you would have immediately shut it down as soon as you heard the ticking sound to save from doing damage to any other parts but at this point I'm guessing you have probably scored the crank pretty well and quite possibly warped a rod or two. You're better off keeping the car, replacing the panels and just buying an entire new engine considering they are only 500 bucks or whatever you said...
hope youre doing good as fuck now james, also, dont give up on that 90s golf, i love 00s and 90s shitboxes and id hate to see that german tin can rust away
I have a 2 door mk6 VW golf with the 2.5l, I'm never selling that thing
Had a golf and loved it. But im 6'5" so i didn't love it for long.
20:19 lol 😂 💨
James is a tbs fan, I can never unsubscribe now
love u pump
"You might as well" only works if you have the money for it. If you are like me, you'll find yourself doing and going back in every time you can afford another part...
The Golf and the R8 are the only good VW's  That's my hot take. Am excited to learn more about the Golf and the VW with the content on this car. EDIT: The Audi S5 is pretty good too. Excluding any race cars from the list of good ones.
In Europe the most tuned cars are Golf specialy mk4 1.9 TDI :D
Personally the worst car ive had was the MK3 Highline VR6.
Bald red guy?
I'm here for it.  VW is what got me into cars in the first place.  Definitely miss VWvortex and H2O...
Why do you still have a donut mic
Speeed makes my day
I come from a long line of VW lovers, two of the cars that I grew up in were a mk1 diesel golf, and a mk4 that my dad still has to this day. My dad would show me pictures of the 68 beetle him and my uncle shared as their first car, and his scirocco that he bought for $50 and had to wire everything to toggle switches because it had an electrical fire.  These things influenced me and my brother so much that I just recently picked up a MK8 GTI as a daily, and my brother has had a MK6 TDI for about  years. Some of my first moments on the internet were spent looking through VWVortex. And I STILL go there when I am working on my car or trying to find the fix to some kind of gremlin. I think everyone who sees the VW scene from the outside underestimates how tight knit and crazy these people are, always pushing the boundaries of the car scene as a whole. So excited to see some VW content!
Been a mk3 guy my whole life, hyped to tag along for this build! I daily a mk7R, garage queen a mk3 jetta and Im Building a mk6 2.5L golf right now!
Donut Operator?
I agree it is the best bang for your buck. Ive owed 3 and want another
as a fellow Mk3 GTi owner (20th Anni 1.8T swap) and a long time old VW owner, they are great cars. there’s nothing more intoxicating than taking a 30 yearold hatchback down an empty road at 140mph+ love these cars.
Get a 1.9 tdi swap
Collector Car Feed > Speeed > (((Donut Media)))
Hell ya brother! Glad to see the golf is getting the love it deserves! This is the VW content YouTube needs! I want to see a build thread on vortex!
Cool video, not a VW fan but those Golf’s are as cool as they come. One request, will you do a video on auto manufacturers selling their customer’s driving data to lexis nexis and other data brokers? Who in turn sell said data to the driver’s insurers. A truly awful practice. I’ve been saying this for a couple years now, and RCR just did a video on it, but as automotive enthusiasts it’s important to get the message out ✌️
I was thinking a 2001-2003 ALH. But as far as I'm aware, I need to wait until next year.
I'm in my -09 S3, hoping the golf gang lets me tag along 🥰 Audi is called an "olympic Volkswagen" where I'm from.
I drive a 2001 celica gt as my daily, I’m 21 in college, and this is a good daily for me because it’s good on gas while it just feels and looks sporty but I want a genuine project car and I’ve thought about a Volkswagen because it would be good to get into euro cars
Why do you have to expose the scene like this..... Us old guys with MK1's like it quiet.... lol
I adore my Mk6, the 5 Cylinder is so much fun, it really sucks that there’s no more Golfs/GTIs in 2 door configurations anymore but I’m thankful I snagged one
My son is driving in a few years and I think a late model Golf with anti theft transmission is best one to get.
I’m with you, great project cars! Check out mine at @ierabbit801
It's Volkswagen said like this:" Folksvargen" no silent letters and not "Voltsvaegen". "Car of the People" in German. Fuck me I edited this 4 times already. I meant to say: "Car of the People" in English. I'm Danish, and I'm sorry about that.
A 24’ golf gti isn’t too bad on the asking price lol I just want dsg farts 😂🤣
They imported that golf 3 from my hometown Raaaaaaah Baden mentioned fuck swabia
Perfect time to put my mint MK6 GLI up for sale in SoCal lol
I recently bought my first car a few months ago and by pure luck I found a VW mk4 golf in oceanic green for £460 and been using it as my daily ever since and I've been doing it up in my spare time and I absolutely love it glad to see some appreciation going to these legendary classics!!
MkII GTi was my 1st car... ummm... no more VWs EVER again... but, Im down for a watch & hope you dont experience abject owner misery like I did...
Everytime James talks about underrated cars that are cool and cheap, they instantly become more valuable.
Saab 9-5 Aero mate, bang for your buck extraordinaire. Get a 2000-04 one, keep the oil fresh, tune it, give it the beans. Glad you've got your Golf back, though. Good times. We used to have a black Mk2 Golf, named her Molly.
07K BABY!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Finally  :)🎉
Funny you should mention this. I’m thinking of buying a 7.5 R for my 30th birthday.
Yes your car was a design insporation but you can’t compare a modified car to the level of this jpperformances build   I do loooove your golf the color is incredible and the swap is perfect but it isn’t a midengined R8 twinturbo sawed in half car 😅
UROgolf on Vortex.. Miss those days
My father had a VW Voyage and VW Parati when I was young, it got me hooked to VW, now I own a MK7 GTI, can’t see myself selling it anytime soon.
Such a nostalgia trip.  Had a mk4 jetta in the early 00s drive a mk7.5 gli now
Y’all can do a collab with Zach and jerrryyyyyy
Okay, now I'm invested
If VW's aren't weird enough for you, get an Isuzu!!! We're even more into them😂
"and most importantly, girls liked them"  Can confirm, i love shitboxes. I do prefer honda tho.
It really sounds like Donut Media was taken over by idiots. Why they'd let that crap happen to this car, I don't know.
I am not buying anymore golfs. but if you need parts from germany hit me up.
.... I used to love this shit now i can't stand new cars
or get a focus SVT for like 3,500 and have a Better project car.
We baaaaackkkk🗣️
Good luck on the build! The car isn't too bad. Its got a rod knock and ring problems. Also some rust.
All the different content on this channel is great but the car stuff is always gonna hit a lil dif for us
Please please please please!!!! Stop using that handheld dynamic mic! It sounds so bad! 😭
I don't like Golf but I love seeing an old car coming back to life I wish U all the best
Although also think the golf is underrated. Most of the scene came from civics. Also the older gen evos, STis. Then you also have the raining king. The eclipse (that was ruined the day we all set eyes on that dirty Vegas days go by video)
B o n e r
Makes me miss my 03 jetta wagon . It was deisel , manual, modified, and so much fun to drive.
Can't wait to see the damage and the rebuild!
One of my favorite cars I’ve ever owned was a MK3 Jetta GLX. Got it by trading a guy for a minivan I paid $700 for.   I spent so much time and money on that car and I loved every second of it. I miss it.
I’m so fucking happy that James’ Mk.3 pulled through in its diagnosis so that it can be built up real nice. I had an old crappy Toyota that died off slowly and I miss it a lot I’m glad he doesn’t have to go through it
a build after my heart
James, my dad bought a 2007 Volkswagen Passat TDI in 2019 since he needed a car, and just recently the clutch finally gave up, I've been into Volkswagens since 2019 and planning to own a VW as my first car, He doesn't know if he's going to scrap it as it has a water leak in the trunk, the rear passenger door won't open from the outside (common issues on the B6-B7 Passats) and a sensor for the rear wheel which he is still yet to replace. I'm trying to convince him to keep it as the engine in his car is the 1.9 TDI (one of the most reliable VW engines) The car is very close to passing 390km (about 240k ish miles) He's had no mechanical problems ever until the clutch giving up. If he decides to keep it i'll let you and others know.  VDUB
0:14 I'd rather say it "inspired" the G3 from JPP instead of "replicated" even if it isn't finished and expirienced big set backs because the frame is sitting to high, its far from a golf 3 with an engine swap, they made a pipe chassis to have different proportions that wouldn't be possible with a "standard" golf and put a v10 (as well as the suspension) from an r8 in the pipe frame.  Theres probably a language barrier but calling this just a "replica" is little ignorant especially considering the amount of work
It’s nice to see a video that’s all about VW… they are rare these days
i have a golf mk3 cabrio and its realy a fun car but guys, dont import from germany the roads there are salty and salt means rust. import from spain , portugal italy or greece.
You forgot to mention the reliability on your list
Looks at the mk3 cabrio in my driveway and pile of parts in my garage.... 👀
The first car that I bought new was a 2006 Mk5 GTI, and I still drive it as my daily.  Probably the only car that I'd consider switching to right now is a Golf R (though if they actually sell their electric GTI in the US that will be in the conversation).
Yessss! James bringing back Vw/audi back on the map! Mk3 sales after this 📈📈
James really said let's go fuck the car market up some more. Nice
bro im so hyped that your still sticking with car “build” content 🙌🏼🙌🏼
This gentleman pushed a MK3 up an incline...in wallabees. Gum sole pittin in work.
Pushing that car up the inclined driveway at the beginning was pretty impressive
Let’s gooo
#DUBLUV
The Golf continues to live on🗣️🗣️
I have a 2015 Passat with the VR6 I absolutely love it!
Rad . I've had lots of old beetles ,87 gti ,99 new beetle, 02 golf tdi .  I miss the 99 beetle.
What? No MO POWER BABY! ? 😂
I honestly don't think JP Performance (0:14) replicated your Golf. I mean they are both amazing builds but except the "category of color" and maybe the wheel style, they are different like night and day.
MORE POWER BABY!!
I’m in for the mk3
More please 🙏
Family.
I still have all those issues of pvw. A good 10 years of them. Flicking though those pages brought back great memories from 2006 when I was at collage and spotted a polo 6n on borbet t wheels, that got me into the scene and all those forums and the community. Pre Facebook pages days.. Still to this day I’m messing about with old vw golfs and polos.
More power baby .....luv from Pakistan . .
James, ik you ain't gon see this, but you have one of the most tasteful VWs I've seen on the internet, you're partially the reason why I'm trying to find a Corrado, lol I'm not having a good time ;)
much love
I remember back when I was a kid I was made fun of for liking Volkswagens. As a trans women I can look back at that and be happy cause honestly Volkswagens of that era were badass!
Probably don't mean much, but I'm a welder and fabricator, I could cut out most of that rust and patch it. You'd never be able to tell
who knows of a good or great car shipping company?
21:30 the smoke at the background 😂😂
This is gonna be so fn sick! Lots of love from Germany <3
I own 2 Golfs myself ( a MK I Cabriolet and a MK8 Clubsport). I love both of them and its super fun to modify them (even with TüV haha). Im exited to see your MK3 Project.
Mk3 😍
I loved going to H2O with my MK3 Jetta GLX. Took over Ocean City, MD!
I still have all those issues of pvw. A good 10 years of them. Flicking though those pages brought back great memories from 2006 and still to this day I’m messing about with old vw golfs.
Didn't you use to be fat?
When I was s teenager I had a 2003 TDI and it was awesome until my friend totaled it
Bruh I've already been lookin for a golf the past year 🤣🤣🤣 so stoked. I love the premise and your thoughts, my man 😊 keep it up!
Fun fact, before I saw this video, after waking up today I thought, what about getting a MK3 or MK5 Golf as a next car... 🙂
And then there was me who went in the opposite direction. Everyone had a gold or GTI.....I got a Tiburon. Been a Hyundai for ever since my excel days. 👍
I have a 2007 Volkswagen rabbit with the 2.5  and a 2006 gti they’re my favorite cars that ever had, definitely underrated
im not even kidding when i say old golfs are the worst cars you can buy, ive had them, beam rear suspension, not reliable, not fast, not good on gas, dont drive well, dont shift well, dont withstand the test of time well. literally anything is better, get a crown vic and put a junkyard 5.3, get a civic and boost a single cam, buy a c4 corvette and drive it bone stock and itll be better than any old golf ever could... fuck golfs...
Omg Taking Back Sunday 😂 yes! I feel that so hard
thanks for shaking up some memories. my first car was a '93 golf mk3 station wagon :)
Where i come from, this means Poland, golfs are treated like a first car to drive around and crash to learn how to drive, which means it was like that for me, until i watched this vid, which made me revise my views on that particular car, my personal preferences lean more onto bora/jetta, but still. James, you have something incredible in you, a spark in an eye which is irresistibly contagious. Your influence on our minds is terrific and im looking forward to change my next notion by your next vid hahahah
That's a wonderful blue colour!
vwvortex was where I lived in the late 90's
I have one 1998 Golf GL 2.0 ❤❤❤😊
WHYCANTIFEELANYTHINGFORANYONEOTHERTHANYOUUUUU
Nobody finishes car projects, be the inspiration
I have a 2000 vw beetle 1.8t it's such a blast to drive!... when it's running 😂 this series is going to be so fun to watch - keep up the great content!
I just picked up a MK5 R32 a few months ago. I had a MK5 GTI for 10 Years, loved that car, did so much to it and sadly had to get rid of it a few years ago. Back then I remeber always wanting the R32 and I finally got one as a weekend driver with lots of plans for it!
I’m a big Golf guy and the mk3 is my 2nd favorite after the mk7.5
When someone says "1990's and early 2000's Car culture" Two cars immediately come to mind.  1. Volkswagon Golfs/Jettas (Golfs with butts) 2. Honda Civics
mk5 and mk6 are just as or even more rusty than the older generations of golf. just for those thinking of buying one, make sure to look them through to check for rust
my project is basicly a 80s jetta/golf with 4wd, its an audi 80 quattro im turboing and making into a gem
Watch avenged the kids watch this show. Start trying to buy all these up and then it's gonna inflate the market on these garbage cars. I got 2 of them given to me last year. And then I resolved them to a friend who built one out of them. And then a neighbor sold me another 1 for $750 with a diesel motor. But when I was in high school about the same time James was. You could get a 1972 monster f****** bad a** Nova. Or a modicarlo or a f****** Ford Galaxy A Torino facebacks, notch backs, didn't matter? They were all a $1000 for a good car. I remember I got a 350/375 horse motor. For $500. I'm talking like at least 5000 though at least.
H2oi!
And now I won’t even be able to build a VW now either 😭 prices about to sky rocket
Yes! I always wondered if we'd ever see this car again.
Awesome reuniting back with this ride. This definitely deserves some love and I can’t wait to see the progress on this.
I have an MK6 drivers edition, and i cant WAIT to be able to mod it how i want to. Such amazing lil cars
I had one, loved that car, however the strut towers rotted out so that was sad day
His drug on
I bought my golf mk4 bcs of james! Got few issue but thats the journey
When my best friend died, I bought his 97 jetta 2.0. Fell in love with it immediately, it was lowered and had a bit of tuning work done, cam, intake, exhaust, and a fart can tail pipe. But it was the most reliable car I had for 5 years it gave up the goat with electrical problems. But I just bought a 2000 jetta vr6. All time favorite car.
James just blowing up the market again 😅
i have had my mk4 for like 11 years now and i still love it. i am so glad its what i ended up with for my first car and that i got to go to H20i, SOWO, and a bunch of local VW meets in the time that i did. I dont understand why these cars dont get much love anymore because they are so much fun and in my opinion: beautiful.
W vid
Project car on the horizon!!
When you lived in Kentucky, did you ever meet Chris at Fast Enough Performance in Lexington?
Let’s gooooo🤤🤤
Right down my alley! I got a Polo 86c and Fabia mk1
ok im excited
Get a R32 damn it! Also, come to the next Pacific Waterland!
Sorry to say this my guy… I only watched Donut for you it was a great platform but you were definitely the talent I’m excited to see where you go wish you the best let’s speeed!!!!
Don’t do it! You love this one! Mid-Pimpin’, savin’ some cheese
no way we have a Jamespump now
My first car was a 98 Cabrio, such a cool car and the ladies loved the roll bar....until it was used for its intended purpose🙃🤣
YES I’ve been wondering where she was
I've ALWAYS loved Jettas rabbits golfs but I'm just noticing how calm James is...good for you buddy👍🏿👍🏿
I bought one cause of u james had real fum with my 1.9tdi golf 3 GTD
James you’re looking pretty fit these days. I’m proud of you
Can we talk about the Audi a3? It’s the golf but Audi it quite literally has almost the exact same engine options just with an Audi logo on it!
great. now all the bros are gonna drive the prices up.
❤❤❤❤ vw content jimny, i own a mkv rabbit and i absolutely fell in love with her.   😅 i can blow my motor and swap in a new one for 500 bucks win win 2.5s are slept on.
does my mk3 scirocco count as a golf too? :)
PLEASEEEEEE don't tell people to buy these! I like having them somewhat cheap 😂😂
Imagine saying a civic is not the best starter car lol bro GTis are expensive regardless of the year lol
Commuinity!
I  did a ground up restoration of a 1975 Scirocco in 1984 while in high school. I was the odd guy that wasn't building a V8 lol
You can see the stress and relief when Castro said he wasn't scared
Project car content lets goo
Yes yes yes and yes!! (Can you get an Audi s3 8L too)
steady cameras dont work for you man
I just crashed my mk7 gti but I will return one day so we can golf it out about our golf’s. #VDUB4EVER
I don't have a golf, but I do have a broken b6 A4 avant in my garage. Project time?!🤔
I'm gonna tell you right now, Volkswagen's. Are garbage? They have good Dick gauge metal and they do well in accidents. But Jesus, are they garbage when it comes to their engines. Sometimes like the ALH they'll build a good motor but everything attached to it is garbage.
Stop stop stop raising prices man. Don’t you get that ReSPonsIBIliTY !??!  Jk ……welllll not jk, but... Keep up the good work.
Nothing dummer looking than a slammed golf
h2oi was a master piece until the takeover scene came about 😕 makes ya feel like a nam vet with flashbacks and also ptsd sprinkled into those memories 🤣
Volkswagens I have owned. 74 rabbit, 82 diesel golf, 87 golf GTI, 2000 Passat b5, 97 Jetta trek. Currently own 07 rabbit, and 2016 Tiguan.
Cant wait for the next video!
Can't wait to see more!
Do you drive a G?
how did go from gasoline burnout to a diesel drive by 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have a 2000 jetta tdi with a big single turbo
As an 8V A3 owner, it's basically a golf with an Audi body and I love it. The ea888.3 is phenomenal and can make 400whp relatively easily. The problem with the Golf platform is it competes with the K series...... really really really hard to beat the K series.......
I bought my mark 3 Jetta for $200 running and driving. Owned it for 10 years and it’s been a fun project/toy adventure.
VW=junk
Whats the discord
That is a zombie car if I've ever seen one. It's dead but alive.
those shoes and socks. fuckin GAY
I just bought a mk6 I wanna kms
got a 2001 b5 1.8t quattro in casablanca white with a lil k04 and a tune, this video inspired me to get workin on that little turd again
I got a mk7 I’m about to take to the track for the first time in a few weeks and I’m excited, Golfs are a great platform
Watching this while owning my ‘12 VW CC with the Gen 2 EA888 2.0T engine. In love with this content. Makes me wanna VR6 swap the CC some day if I can keep the thing running long enough.
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite youtube channels. I never watched donut so I didn't even know who this was. He's just good.
Happy for you dude, we love good news from a mechanic
James wearing a medium build hat made me love him 100x more
If you ain’t rubbin’ you ain’t dubbin!  Joey Ghetto Mod from the ‘tex ;)
Hell yeah 👌
I'd say that the air-cooled VWs up to '67 had a low-key influence on the "extreme" negative camber look being somewhat accepted on a lowered car.   I don't remember any other makes/models that had that much rear camber when lowered when I got into cars in the late '80s/early '90s.
In usa possibly best bang for buck i disagree bang a decent engine in an audi a2 you have a serious sleeper on your hand and they don't rust
Luv ya! But, safety glasses!
My boy james got thin😢
1:31 confirmed, blew up my 05 g35 Sedan (👀) like this
I want a MK1
HYYYYYYPPPPEEEEE
I 1000% beileve you should buy a mk3 they are super safe i got into an accident with my mk3 and did like front flips and only broke my wrist
FAIR WARNING FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN MK5 AND MK6 GTIS!!!!! IF ITS CHEAP THERE IS A REASON! Most people sell their cars right around the time their timing chains start to fail, there is a whole list of issues with these cars at high mileage 100k+. Some guys in the forums will tell you to look for certain years or features but no car is exempt from these issues.
My first car was a 97 gti MK3 2.0 my second one was a 98 VR6. So proud of my car history lol
I own a Citi golf known as rabbit in USA , I absolutely love the car wouldn’t trade it for anything.
“ Obi - won - Canobi ❤”
Turning James into the SEC for insider (car) trading
I really needed a speed video after the week i've had 🙏
As someone who’s owned 14 mk3 vws and has seen TBS like 16 times I’ve always known James and I were the same person
moo powahh
Or don’t live in the USA and get a scirocco project instead 👀👀
My top ten reasons why to get a celica: tis reliable and a lot of aftermarket solutions, if you don’t get a 4th gen like me :P
Murphy’s law on wheels
Never selling my mk4 24v!
Even though its being rebuilt, it was hard watching that engine running while you are both chatting away..
Wtf that „Replicated“ golf is something way different your shit box the only thing same to yours is the modell and color 😂
I used to own two Golf mk2 a couple years ago, they where worth absolutely nothing at that point, gave one away and sold the other one for 100 bucks, less than i bought the rims for. I miss them every day...
Guy up the street had a 90s VR6. I had a 94 hatch with the B18 swap. Back in 2002. And we would talk shit about each other's car all the time in a fun way. But I beat him most of the time. But I had a few more mods. Can't wait to see it all done the way you want it.
im from norway i have had alooot of golfs but the mk3 has always been my favorite
Don’t you mean the only two things it’s never been is running and driving?
I'm watching this in my mk4 gli with parts for my mk4 gti in the truck
speeed x big time collab into a new channel called Bagel?
my favourite  car is the one im working on now and documenting an old 1990 mk2f polo if you want to check it out on my page that would be great
@1:30 queue piston slap
Haha how is your car so rusty in California?
German over Japanese? NEVER!
please dont call JPs car a copy of yours, its completly different. its basically an Audi R8 with a Golf over it
I have a PD130 Skoda Diesel, it was in my garage for 3 years, started on the button. They say there's two things that survive a nuclear war, cockroaches, and VW Pump Deuse engines, and I believe them...
Re watched that video of it being made yesterday as it goes
What if i build my 3-wheeler, can we still hang out? I could pain a 4th wheel and "A Golf" on it
james seems so much happier and motivated about this channel im so happy to see, cant wait to join the membership too!
When it’s done come to L’oe Show in Pottstown Pa James I would love to see it in person
I drive a mk4 gti and I love it to death its such a fun car to whip around
1:30 naaah, don't worry about it, it's not blown engine, it just auto swapped for the default engine for golf: the almighty 1.9tdi
Looks like golfs are going to get expensive real soon
Shout out to the Medium Build hat - nice!
My project car I just picked up today is a 1996 mercury cougar can't wait to get into it
i need more james !!! 👹
folksfagen garbage
And golf and bang for your buck shouldn’t be in the same sentence ..
quite ironic that insurance for a golf is fkin expensive in germany  same for a license wish i could do some cool shit with a golf but i got no moneeeee
I had the pleasure to see it at the l'oe show in PA. Glad to see it back in the right hands. And don't get me about old H20 before all the goons ruined it. Some of the best times and best people to be around.
First car was and still is a vw mk3 jetta 1.8
VWs are sick.  Since Honda started making duds with the head gasket issue on turbo civics, I switched over to VW, haven't regretted it yet.
I daily a 2k16 golf Sti. Yeeee
I've owned a Corrado G60 since I was 19 years old, amazing car! Haven't been runned for the last few years, but I plan to revive it soon.
Before I moved to New York I went through a bunch of project cars, but none of them still stick in my mind like my GTI 337. That thing was so dialed in and fun to drive
The shoes are fire dude 🔥🔥
Saw this while at the shop last Monday. Even in its current state it still has presence. Brought back my old MK2 GTI vortex days. I always wanted to do a mid engine 1.8t swap but got sidetracked with e30s and motorcycles.
I have a mk7 base golf. Thing FUCKS for how cheap it is. Lil 5speed manual turd it’s so much fun
If you think that's a lot of rust, you haven't left California (only a joke, plz no punterino)  The trailers I've worked on in the past, ALL RUST. Anything metal, rust biscuits everywhere (rust jacking is the proper term, but I like rust biscuits better)
Bring back the 00's modifications please😊
I have a mk7 base golf. Thing FUCKS for how cheap it is. Lil 5speed manual turd it’s so much fun
As someone who's first car was a banana yellow '77 rabbit and who's dad, back in the early 90s, raced old VWs in NASCAR mini stock at our local race track, I have a real love/hate relationship with little VWs.  Fun little cars, but the electric gremlins in the old rabbits...
if they are so cheap and fun why not buy another newly used one?
I love this, man. Keep up the good work!
as someone whose been huge in the vw community since i was a kid, i am so damn happy to see this car get re-built, makes me want my slammed VR6 cabrio back :(
how can you neglect so much a car you love...
what is the song around 10:38  ?
car magazine where they fired James May*
Remeber those good donut days?
Strolled back down here a second time to say... Of course you like Medium Build lol.
Pog
My 46 y/o brother got a 2013 r 😂 you right bout asking your older brother
Now trade it for an Mk2 16V! Then start the build 😉  VDUBs 4eva!
Someone buy my broken gti.........
I’d love a Volkswagen but my girls worst ex had one so it wouldn’t really work🫠  We’d never go out in my car😂
My dad’s dream car was a VW mk7 and back in 2017 he got one new, now it’s my daily driver and it’s a great daily driver, and so much fun. It’s always surprising people
Dude, Golf has never been undervalued lol
i dont call it a "might as well" and more of a "While im in there"
Aaaaannnnnnd there goes the VW market.
0:25 James is trying to get his Volkswagen documented before ICE deports it
You should tell us more about your G klass :)
This just got very exiting!!!
Not gonna lie stoked for this build been watching since it was on Donut
Love me some vws!!!
I drive a 4runner and a duramax... can we still hangout? I would love to build a street car again... my E46 manual wagon was one of my favorite daily drivers I've ever had.
Im 10 minutes into the video and I strolled down to the comments to say... I wish the video was longer already lmao.   #thenewtopgear
Ban Hawc @speeed
I can’t believe the guy who sold you the car 15 years ago thought about if you were affected by the wildfires. That’s so kind & thoughtful. Just like Jesus taught us. “Love your neighbor as yourself” 🙏🏽
Absolute garbage of a car .
haha! My old golf makes an appearance at 2:46. Long live the Mk3!
Yes! I love it!  I love the back story not just the turning wrenches!
my first car was an 04 VW Passat 1.8t with a 5 speed, I loved that car as much as it broke on me and even after having to swap 2 engines into it cuz the previous owner never serviced the timing system, and my used wrecking yard engine had it's timing cover damaged when I crashed that car and it rubbed on the belt causing it to eventually snap and blow my 2nd engine, it's sitting in my parent's backyard rn with a new head on it, and waiting for a new turbo, my boyfriend has been waffling over weather he wants to buy it off me, ever since it's been sitting I've wanted to get back into the VW scene, I might try and sell off some junk and trade some stuff around to try and weasel my way into a Mk3 golf, a B3 Passat, or maybe even a VW Quantum if I can find one
Crazy in sweden they cost like 1000-1500😊☺️
I ran into the "well you're already in there, so you might as well!" trap when I rebuilt my turbo EJ25 in my '04 Forester XT 😂 what started out as a simple rebuild for a spun rod bearing turned into ordering a brand new Shortblock with forged pistions, new upsized oil pump, new Kevlar timing kit, new exhaust valves, new valve springs, arp head studs, new big turbo, equal length header, and more that Im sure im forgetting! But, after waaaay more money than I planned on spending, at least I can say I hand built my engine myself and it's fast as hell! 😂
Finally beating the SEO great to see
“There not as popular as they once were” I see atleast 4 modded Vk’s a day
I already have a golf project, I don't need another one lol. Rave Green gti swapped to an alh to make a gtd
James I have a golf project... Mk6 with ~200k. Bunch nice suspension mods, newish DSG, exhaust, intake and other power bits in waiting for uhhhhhhhh fundz
hi from Ireland ive 2 mk3 golfs gti's myself i love them
as someone who's first car was a MK4 GTI then moved on to a MK5 Jetta then this Sunday getting into a accident and she's all totaled now, I'm glad this video popped up on my feed. Think my time with German cars is up and I'm going to be moving on to JDM cars but this series got me hyped LETS GO
Are you not the guy from donut
Anyone know a good project car as a station wagon?
I'm a V8 vintage Mustang guy, and I agree the scene sucks, the guys are cool but the VW and JDM scene is where its at.
Please not again, we did that back in the late 90s in Europe.
Just bought a mk4 Gti 1.8T with only 50k miles   Can’t wait to start modding it.  Already ordered coilovers
21:30 hell yeah 😎
I currently drive a MK7 Jetta with small exterior mods, but my first car was a 2004 Passat. I’m also in LA, but I don’t see a lot of Jetta/Golf guys over here. Glad to know that James is one of them. VW Boys Unite!
I have a sportwagen but would LOVE a Japanese R version Sportwagon. Paddy on Speedhunters has one in Ireland.....Great cars! Still want an R32 with VR6!
I've got a 93 corrado 2.9 vr6 and love it even if the engine is under powdered for the size, also have a mk2 golf with the mk3 ABF engine and it's so fun to drive especially weighing less than 850kg as it gives boosted cars a run for their money. Just need get my mk1 caddy pickup on the road next. I'm not a vw fan honest
Had Mk3 golf 10years prior, one of bigger car regrets selling it. Even if it rusted like Crazy.
Yeah. I’ve got a mk2 golf Gti project and love it.
Why not just pick up another used 5cyl. beef it up and then swap it in.
let's gooooo !
Man this made me miss my MK1 Swallowtail I sold when I moved three years ago. Thankfully I at least kept my '63 Beetle.
Loving all the recognition that 2.5s have been getting lately! I love the golf, happy to see you are working on it!
I miss my mk4 tdi 5speed white lowered on bbs wheels… had the vnt17 turbo with Recaro leather seats
Don't have a golf... but 97 2dr mitsubishi mirage 4g64 swap...I got that
Hell yeah!
Wow, I loved VW’s, listened to Taking Back Sunday and spent many hours on the Vortex.
Finally an actual car video on a channel name speed. Not here for the cloths or cameras. Love James and wishing him all the best but not interested in the other content. Also the JDM scene in Southern California as we know it started in the late 80s early 90s. I grew up in the SGV in went to high school in the mid 90s and we were cutting springs, cold air intake, big ol’ wangs. Etc etc.
stoked the chassis can live on! I've repaired a rusty car before *well I paid someone to* and it's only going to increase the strength of your bond with the car. stoked to follow along
First car I bought with my own money was a 92 mk III golf Sport, after graduating college.  White with black interior and the classic tartan cloth seats.  Learned to drive Stick on that baby. Autocrossed it for two years, and made a best friend doing so.  We both got that thing up on two wheels then immediately retired it. Roof had ripples in it from torquing the frame of the car when racing.  I had no money to improve that beauty, but I loved it.  Drove it into the ground! Miss her all the time.  That and my 1982 VW Vanagon!
Subbed cause I love your personality.
What happened to the bmw
GOD DAMNIT NOW EVEN PARTS CARS ARE GONNA BE EXPENSIVE
Get a golf mk4 r32. Awd and a sick engine
3:00 I still have a bunch of early 2k's magazines and a bunch are PVW. Gonna go relapse now
You should come down to South Africa next weekend 🔥VDUB campfest is one of the largest VW events. I think as VW fan you would love it. Jamie Orr comes down to it every year. Might be short notice of course 🤣 but you have to come see it at least once.
South Africans would love this episode, here they these vw's
Been an avid Vdub enthusiast for the better part of 25 years (20+) mainly my love was Mk1-3 but I did own a few Mk4s..I use to rock a huge  VW flag off the side of the garage and had many bins of “extra” parts that I swore I would need some day East coast Canadian VW …CO motorsports on YouTube
swagalotor'
I friggin love this Golf
spent 2k on my mk5 rabbit 5spd with only 160k miles on it 3 years ago and its been one of the most fun cars i have ever driven nimble and reliable currently has 205k on the clock and its still a fun backroad warrior car I started telling my friends and others that it would be a Perfect cheap AutoX or Hillclimb car
Another reason is the capability of the platform…  do you wanna an economic daily that gets over 40mpg? Get a mk4/6 TDi.  Do you want a rowdy AWD track car that can be a daily? Get a R32. You want a roadtrip car that can also lay frame? Get a sportwagen.
You cant find a cheap VW around here.  It's like all the VW fanboys of Michigan all live here in West Michigan.  There are thousands of modded VWs around here.  Being a beach town might have a little to do with it, but still, it means they arent cheap and laying around.  at least here. lol
That “might as well “ is the reason I built upper on  my S2k to make it redline to 10k
3:06 can anyone give me an ID of this VW? Much appreciated
Same condition here in Tx is like 10gs nah I’m good
In Mexico we call Volkswagen enthusiasts vagueto, so James is officially a vagueto
Ow yeah the golf/rabbit is starting to get expensive in the netherlands
Mk3s are weird, everyone hated them when they were new and the stigma stuck with them. They’re the least desirable generation of Golf and i think that’s why they’re still cheap.  I’ve always wanted a mk3 gti anniversary, not sure if you got them in the US but we got them over here and they had the coolest interior of any mk3 IMO.   I say I’ve always wanted one then bought a mk2 with no engine 😂
lol leaving the car running at the end is such rage bait
IT LIVES!
The used VW golf market is about to inflate 🥲🥲
I instantly started looking for a golf.
“ The sketchier the WiFi the better the coffee” - James
Golf 3 without Rust is a Myth, because the Golf 3 was made during the Lopez Era which means this thing is cheap build. Look for a Golf 1,2,or 4 to built because the others will get you headaches pretty much
Yes! this is what dudes want! a tutorial to make poor financial decisions, step by step.
I sold my mk3 vr6 for $2800 and bought a 2wd ford ranger with that money when I was a dumb kid
Okay I bought a 24’ MK8  What now?
Glad it off that lift just cooking in the sun
Too much ad to care
LET’S GOOO JAMES!!!!! 💪🏻🔥💪🏻🔥
Yes Golf will shoot up in price once YouTubers tell you to get a car more people will go after that model and price will shoot up.
Man now U nailed it! got my attencion! Bring back cool to VW  I just came back to vw after 15yrs and many rwd- bought mk1 cabrio karman cause its some much fun and mu girl and fiends love it
Alright so my dad has a Jetta like that (Vento actually, but that's because it's for another market) and it's been driven over 1 million kilometers with 0 engine rebuilds. Yeah it's rusty as hell but the AAM engine turned out to be crazy reliable. Still in the family
The “might as well” is the biggest self sabotage but we all do it and will continue to do so
i have golf project <3
I bet those people at 15:58 were like "WTF?" then if they recognize him they'll say "oh it's just James being James again" 💀
Can you talk about how you get around SMOG with an engine swap?
I'm old as shit and looooooved vw's when i was younger, I was always going to shows and stuff with my beetle, went through 6 built engines then moved onto a mk2 gti and loved that too, maybe i should put another shell on my bug because i still have the rolling chassis..... it currently has a beach buggy shell on it
I'm excited to see the VW again! I also feel a lot better about my Miatas rust after seeing the VW.
Dude this is sweet!! I have a MK1 GTI I’m currently swapping with a VR6.. and literally hearing you talk about the love for ur car is crazy relatable 🥹 nothing better than having an obtainable dream car made into a reality😍 looking forward to the build!
The feels of vortex and going to barns and  noble to get PVW in the 2000s.  Anyone ready rat stylez on Vortex
I have a golf mk3 europe (75hp lol). My sister blown the head gasket and i'm going to try repair it myself. I have no real experience as a mechanic but i wanna try
But I already have Nord and a GTI
make it RWD
Castro has no fear! Look forward to this series!
James!I Totally agree! I have an MK1 Let's hang out!  https://www.youtube.com/@thepretendmechanic
Currently I have 93 Cabriolet Collectors Edition, my ninth MK1 or MK2 VW.
I want a mk2 gti so bad.
Would love to see a all you need to know type video on the Mitsubishi colt or also know as the L200 warrior etc
Finally some car content
This is the worst Golf. Period. Good luck.
That transition from the driveway to your garage when you were starting the list was slick. Love the fact that you carried over the shake between shots.
James driving a G-Wagon around LA. True content lifestyle. Makes me happy to see him and everyone involved with this channel be successful.
Wow, the VWVortex mention brought me back 15 years.  I used to post and read threads all the time at my crappy job on the work computer when i bought my first car, 2004 Jetta TDI, the 1.9 turbo diesel. I loved that car. Had 2 12's in the trunk with the Monsoon stereo, it had a factory amp in the trunk .   I learned a lot (mostly what NOT to do) with that car.  My favorite memory of VWVortex was a guy building a RWD Mk4 with the engine in the backseat. Almost all the replies were along the lines of "youre a crazy person and this is a terrible idea and waste of time and money....keep us updated" 😂
civic
13:13 still wish I never got rid of my first car, 1.8t MK4.
sayin jp performance replicated ur golf is crazy bro
21:15 HE SAID IT, BABY
God speeed, James! Excited to see where this build leads you!
YOUR LIPSTICK HIS COLLAR DONT BOTHER ANGEL I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT GOES ON
#commuinity 8:37 ❤
Early from sweden
Did i Just see JPs golf?
Never owned a mk3 golf but owned a mk4 2.slow 5 speed loved it sold it to a buddy needed more love then I had money to give it , still running strong at 290k🎉
not mentioning more on the ALH TDI but when going through engine options almost feels illegal. Great video love it!
Both golf and I have had a rough couple of years 😅 I love speeed!
First car was a 94 corrado. Was very active on the Tex and I’ve def spent some time with my car on the eurowise lifts
You're making the value go up. Now I can't afford one James sorry 😢
Love the Speeed sticker on the mic
Sick wallabees
nice video i also have a golf 3! with a vento front and a zender spoiler and more tuning keep these video,s coming!!
Bro this love stays. I was involved in edition 38 back in the day and had the pleasure to come to h20 international. Was an awesome experience well up there with worthesee and i have never forgotten it.
The only vw i can get is the Gol not the Golf
yeah idk about this. I had a 2012 CC 2.0t and it was the worst engine i ever had. 0/10 would not recommend..
these are my favorite generation of VWs. I've owned 3 already and still planning on buying another at some point.
I´m from Germany. If you need a new VW from here I´m glad to help :)
I just bought a mk7.5 gti like three weeks ago, its so damn fun
the smile at 20:46 - that's a happy car guy right there.
12:00 I am astonished at the absence of road noise coming into that microphone on James' hat.
CARS
I had an 86' fox with the 4 speed manual back in the day. best darn car I've had, and you got me wanting to bring back the classics
More YouTube channels should be able to do this, essay videos, tier lists, car builds and generally awesome content that is varied. If the videos are good you’ve got your audience and you’ve got us bro!
Gotta commend you James! on bringing the cultural & social significance of car culture & adapting it to the modern era, whilst still accommodating the o.g gear heads and the average dude diving into car culture. Excellent video!
Vw’s and minitrucking are directly responsible for the way show cars are built to this day.
Mk2 and mk3 Golf are the best ones. Others are shit.
Might as well put in forged internals know
Bring back “up to speed”
James is talking about Golfs again. The world is healing. lol.
Golf Mark 2 and Mark 3 are so cool
id love to find my stepdads old 1972 or 1974 rabbit gti, was red and before he got rid of it(needed a new oil pan and a few other little things) he had teardrop rims on it with a 2.0 in it, it ended up going from northeast ohio all the way to chicago and the title was never changed and he started getting parking tickets. doubt the car is still around but thats a car id love to see again, looked almost identical to the golf at 8:26
Hey James I'm so glad that you kept making videos after 🍩. I've been watching you for about 6 years now and when I found speeed I was really happy. So I guess what I'm saying is Mo' powA Baby!!!! Keep these awesome videos coming bro. Please bring back you clumsy cousin lol
I mourn the loss of my first car everyday and its been almost a year since it happened. In November of 2007 my mom bought the new 2008 mk5 Jetta in salsa red with the 07k off the showroom floor. 10 years later she gave it to me and it just happened to hit 80k miles in the first week. I did everything to that car. Brakes, radiator, short ram intake, 10in subwoofer and more. I changed the oil every 5k miles. Built to last, I trusted that car to take me anywhere. I trusted it with my life. The day someone pulled out in front of me and totalled that car I looked down at the dash of my immobilized car at the odometer and it read 189,000. I never had as much as a single mechanical failure. I literally cried. It never failed me or left me stranded, like a real homie does. It felt like I lost a friend that day.
You should definitely talk to JPPerformance. He might have connections to get some of the period correct stuff you're looking for.
...with a channel name like Speeed, you'd think you would build a MazdaSpeed3 :P a real mans hot hatch! haha
Jesus loves you and died for your sins Give Him your Heart and he will handle the rest ❤
ay yo I know this fella 8:02  @brett.mk2  he's cool
As someone who has a golf, I want to hang out with James and talk about the little things. 🎉yay golf content!
Sorry, I fell asleep!
I have one, a booty version. 2003 Mk4 Jetta Wolfsburg, I love her
HeeeeeeYawwww 🤝 #dubbin
1:18 That's not car, that's weight reduction! 😂
Thanks for driving up the value of my shitbox !!!
I'll stick with my MK2 Scirocco's,  But the MK3 Golf is a good one to work with.
I had a 2005 GLI Mk4 and I miss this car so much. Best car I've ever had
Man im hyped! To see such emotions for a car, here I was, think I'm a weirdo for truely loving my car. Im just so happy for you my guy
Ayooooo @brett.mk2 I see you!
21:14 James you missed the chance to say your best tagline "Cause Mo Power Baby!!"
Glad things are looking bright for you, James. Thoroughly enjoyed your cameo in Forza Horizon 5 and was quite anxious to see what'd happen after Donut kinda turned into a do-not.
Hard to take ur taste seriously when you wearing those shoes :D:D
Wow thanks James now I HAVE to get my B3 12v Vr6 Passat GLX back on the road! VW Culture needs cars like ours
I have had 3 of this generation golf. Absolutely my favorite. Glad that you got your Golf. If I can assist in any way with parts please feel free to reach out. Would be happy to help a fellow enthusiast !!
Excited for your new build
I don't know why, but I thought you were the guy from Seal on Tour.  I was like what the heck is he doing in India!!! 😂😂😂
Hmmm…tempting tempting.  Question. If I get a golf do we automatically become best friends?     Lol.😂
guys how do we feel about ford probes
Bald red guy?? Are you talking about red skull from captain America?
You're a legend and I'm so glad you still enjoy putting videos out / providing us with awesome content.
6:24 James's Big Brain Moment.
My 1st car was the GSX 1800
This was an excellent video, sure you have a lot of charisma, u really made me feel anxious over your car and the fact that if the engine can be used.  Keep it up :)
Now, I wouldnt call JP Performance's V10 swapped, tube framed, and from scratch engineered Golf a replica of yours James ;D
VWVortex was my home for years and my first purchase was a MK3 Golf. Looking forward to seeing what you do. Be different with your 2.5. Put it on ITB's.
I have boxes of performance VW
Trippin. German cars (and their parts)  aren’t  cheap in America
Copy by JP? Oh Boy, you have absolutey no idea. 👎
i needed this video..
Haven’t even watched the actual video yet…  I saw it was posted a few hours ago, and figured I’d get my comment in before it’s lost in the either of bulk.  MKIII VW’s are an amazing platform for one to hop into.  Grabbed my ‘95 GLX off my older brother 20+ years ago. Everyday’d that shit, basically up until now. Wrenched on it and customized up until now myself. It’s taught me so much in the automotive realm. I’d research things to no end, and wrench until I had it back driving. Even with my father yelling at me about it, I’d still take care of business and continue that endeavor. It’s a great start. Just sayin’…
Love the Medium Build hat!
I’m excited 😁
YAAAAA VW
VR6 and 16v swaps. MK1 to MK3 builds back in the day. Brought back a MK1 teaching my kids to drive on that now. Let’s go 🎉
Can we please get some "Might As Well" merch?
Or how about road worthy
I want a vw caddy and vr6 swap it
my 08 rabbit is so fun
Any Europeans out here? This guy is crazy, my thumb is up!
I’ve always liked how golfs look and their egg shape, especially the newer ones. Being a Honda boy I wouldn’t mind picking one of these cars up! Also loved learning the history around golfs!
Hey!! Lets not drive up the prices of vw’s lol
I used to have a 2003 GTi 20th Anniversary Edition. It was a really fun car, but at the time I wasn’t making much money and it was expensive to repair and maintain. I wouldn’t mind getting another one though, maybe a Golf R.
Perhaps this will influence me to actually work on my MK1
Nice one James man! I’m an 80’s kid, BugJam/Big Bang (Santa Pod), “Run to the sun” etc….somewhat forged who I am through the VeeDub scene. I was always into both the air breathers and the water drinkers. Looking forward to what goes down 😃
Suuuper stoked for this build
I see what you did.. They asked if you wanted to go to the Volkswagen offices in Germany. And you said.. "nah, but I'll take my Volkswagen back". 👍👍
Was big into the cow scene in the early 2010s with my mk6 gti that was once featured on ECS Tunings site. Worked at H20 a few times. Got to witness the Supra the lost control and crashed into the external stairs on the side of a hotel at h20. Spent time in Helen GA that time of year we would take over that amazing little German town with nothing but vws. But sadly I stopped going to h20 and all the shows due to more and more idiots comings ruining it for everyone. I remember a time when meets used to be respectful. But after ecs destroyed my ecu on my mk6 gti getting it tuned there and then not re sealing the ecu which got water damage and then fighting with them through my local vw/apr dealer and then it going to court. On top of what the scene became I was over it. But damn do I miss my vws when they ran 😂
jokes on you, I already have a golf
Yeah, man, I know how you feel. I still have my 97 TJ Wrangler, and I am now 38. My dad gave me that car when I was in high-school and I will probably never sell it. Too many memories 😂
5 Cylinder enthusiasts need to rally around this rebuild
Cunning stunts jump scare
I want a 94-95 Jetta so bad 😔
James, love this style of vid. You had me rekindle my childhood love of the Golf, too. Very happy where you’re going. Keep it up! 👍
This is awesome!  I'm in the process of obtaining a mk7 GTI myself.  When my younger son graduates college in May, we're giving him my current car (2018 Toyota iM), and I finally get to get something a lot faster and more fun.  I've always wanted an older 911, but it's just not in the cards, so I'm going the next best thing: GTI with a few mods to get me up to the power of a 911 only without the ridiculous insurance or maintenance costs 😄
It accually had window in it and still rolled after that moron had it! Be amazed!
Vw scene is absolutely massive and the largest scene in the UK. The largest volkswagen festival in Europe takes place at Santa pod Raceway in poddington, England. It’s called BugJam and I’m very excited for this year’s
That car has about the same amount of rust as a 10 year old car in the rust belt lol. I'm excited for the build!
James, you can tell me about nose hairs and I’m pretty sure you could convince me they’re cool!
loved it
Finally! Car stuff! This is why I tune in! Not for the book club….
THE CASUALLLLL MERCH MENTIONS goooo tooooo hardddd 😮😂😂
What’s Facebook Martin place?
We gotta get a James G-Wagen walk through! His looks clean
The fact that JP Performance, the one of the best and most respected german car tuners replicated your car is amazing. I beg you to stay as close to the original looks of the car because it's just ICONIC at this point.
18:07 damn! Haven’t seen a yellow e30 M since n years
Brooo I spent thousands of hours on vwvortex while downloading songs from limewire between the years of 2001 and 2006. That was the best era. Peak humanity. Kids today will never know
I miss my Bora
I have a 2017 e-golf can I still play?
❤content
Ugh vortex ..  I miss those days. I do miss my mk2s and 3s all the time .
I just hopped on marketplace and here in Croatia where i live ive found 2.5 v6 passat from 2002 with 250k kilometers in very good condition for 2000€
True story ,my wife didn't want to marry me if I buy a Volkswagen 😂 And yes I did buy one
seeing vwvortex was like remembering a long forgotten childhood friend! My old man had a mk2(?) rabbit & a 16v Scirocco back in the 90s when we lived in Cleveland. and because of that my aging millenial dream car is a Corrado.
I absolutely love chill James I’ll be honest I didn’t like you at donut because of how loud you were but here you’re amazing
*_You gotta TwinCharge it bro 🤯 That'll get you into the magazing for sure!_*
I am proud of you for starting your own channel and taking the hit leaving the D. It was exhausting the last year seeing how over it you and J were at D. Cheers man. In my front lot (Scotland) we have a mits evo, dodge stealth, niss stagea and a handful of GTIs. The GTIs are the best for rolling up on an RS and serving it some exhaust. Jesse was done wrong on that Jetta. That car was much better than an s2000 for so many reasons.
First car was a ‘91 Golf 1.8, then a 2000 Gti VR6, now holding on to my ‘15 Golf 5 speed 2 door for dear life. The last hot hatch.
this is exciting ! VDUBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Not a fan of car channels that let others do the work on the car.
MORE OF THIS LESS OF THE HISTORY OF STUSSY
No love for the corrados?
Sick project
Had a 08 GTI and when I found out I was going to be a dad I traded it for a tiguan. It was the stupidest move I made cause all I do is think of that car and would love to find out where it is if it is still around anymore
there are so many new friggin member clubs for YouTube channels these days, but to be honest, this is the one to be apart of. James' and Jesse's time at Donut contributed to the genesis of modern automotive YouTube and its so rad they are looksmaxxing with their own channel now  please continue to absolutely send it and Gods speeed with this next chapter
I've owned a Mk3 GTI 16v and everything you said about the car,community,wide range of modifying is 100% correct.This car was such a huge step for me into the car world-so much modification,so much late nights,so much fun behind the wheel...
old vw mags are sick. have a couple vw speed mags here. fun to see what was cool with these cars back then
I already have a Golf3 project in the garage 🙌
Weren’t the American Rabbit hatchbacks basically Golfs?
Man, I've been running my Mk7 Sportwagen as just a commuter as the first owner, and it's already gone through 1 engine. I love how it looks but the darn thing has so many issues.
Rip H2Oi
I just want another 240sx 😢 I regret it so much now that I got rid of it
Well now I want to rebadge my Mk5 Jetta to “Golf with a Butt”.
YES! would have loved if you kept the 86, but i do love your golf
16:56 *_EK HATCH SPOTTED_*
Welcome back to the vw world dude mk4 tdi wagon
Already there buddy. Mk5 GTI
Since i was a kid, i always wanted a Golf III Variant since i loved vw, old cars and wagons. But then i discovered the Passat 35i B4 Variant and now i got 4 of them in my parents driveway 😁
"That's car" Only in the same way that Dinosaur fossils are Dinosaur bones.
Does this mean I should buy another Golf just to support the movement? I currently have 6...
20:57 James - "Let me walk you through the plan for this engine..." Me - "TURN IT OFF, TURN IT OFF!!"
I have a brand new golf R. Can I be your friend too? 😢
Look at mr Dahlbäck golf 😅 800+hp quattro from imsa serie Audi car and engine from Audi Sport quattro 😅
I'm not looking for a project....hmmm what are those golfs going for.
speeed makes me wanna act up and start a new expensive hobby
You need to get VW people together and buil awesome VW's! 100 out of 10 would watch!   I own and love my Mk4 2.8 4motion! ❤️ best car ever!
Golfs have always been massive here in the uk i have an old MK1 golf gti cabby. But the mk3 id proberbly the least desireable here though but ive always love them all.
Instructions unclear, been on vortex for 20 years and own 11 VW's, can we be friends? 😂💚
Someone's been losing weight.
I most definitely want to see the progression of this rebuild.  As an owner of a 5 cylinder Volvo v70, and someone who's Jones'n for a Golf GTI as my next purchase, I am in!  YT algo do your thing!
As a 90s kid who owns a 60s Beetle - I am SO excited to watch this project!!! VWs for life baby!
I'm so happy to see him super lively again. He truly seems comfortable again. Extremely excited to see this VW come back to life!
Are there any plans to make anymore fashion history videos? Definitely not into fashion but I found the Stussy video incredibly interesting from a psychology and marketing perspective!!! Would love to see more videos similar to it!
Bought mine in 2001. Still have it today.   https://youtu.be/oqsP4dpFW-g?si=sFhFoei5YeF8o5zx
That outro music is so good
Bosanci vriste od euforije 😅
Goood damn that is f'd.
What is donut lol
As a MK3 nut case. This video was just amazing. Loved it. It needs some BBS RS's
Replicated... 🤣
Can I be in the Golf club if I have a 2000 Audi A3? :P It does have one of those 4 cylinder VW engines though. :D
All I want is a diesel Rabbit pickup…
I have an MK8 GTI. Love the GTI platform cant wait to see what you do!
ps topgear the magazine was named after topgear the show, the show aired like 1978 and the magazine 1993
3:35  When? 20 - 25 years ago?   The Import Tuner scene was on fire back then!  Golden Era!
"artificially increasing the price of mk 3 Golf's"
The Nord jingle reminded me how much I wanted Jerry and James' Hat Country Trucker Man Music Songs the Ablum
I would love to get me dirty little hands on a scirocco or a 944
Happy you get to build your baby James! Now you'll have to choose between your Bimmer and your VW... First world problems for sure! 💪
Let's go! love this car build!
Go to the Netherlands basically the only car u see lmao
I feel like you've blown a lot Donut engines....😂
Pretty happy for you that pit in your stomach went away and it can be salvaged. Nice.
Good to see a car getting repaired and not scrapped
I have a Volkswagen Polo Mk4 (9n3), I absolutely love it! My dad has had a Beetle, Golf 2, 3, Passat B5, Polo Mk5 (6r), and now the Skoda Octavia and Kamiq which are both VW chassis. Volkswagens are in my blood and I will always love them!  I want my next project car to be a Bora (Jetta).
Oh this is gonna be so good
5:38 Brb, gonna go rebadge my mk6 jetta "Golf w/ a Butt"
You’re telling me your car is undocumented? That’s it time to deport😂😂😂
90's hatchbacks rock. I still daily a 92 Toyota Starlet which let me be clear is not fast. However it could smoke a 92 VW GTi even though the engine was less powerful and had less displacement. However the Starlet was way lighter because it had nothing of luxury. Power steering, AC!? Pfffft hell no. Just bare bones fun.
I used to download H2O videos before YouTube. I miss my mk3 VR.
VWVortex! That site sucked too much of my life and money away.
Honda and VW were the kings of hot hatches of the 90s
first trannies, now we're calling engine bays "shaved and tucked"? girl...
I have an extremely nice ‘04 VR6 that’s practically done, just needs new head unit, fix unraveled stitch in leather, fix headliner, new exhaust, rust bubbles on hatch, driver window about to come off track, new water pump, new crack pipe, replace worn coil overs, steel brake lines etc etc etc
2:48 It also featured AUDI models, even 25 years ago! 👍🏼
My first car was a ‘99 Jetta GT
That 2.5 5 cylinder is crazy reliable. There was a Passat with over 600,000 miles on the original engine on Reddit's r/volkswagen page a while back.
VWs are garbage 💀
I used to have a four door Volkswagen Fox. Not a day goes by that i regret getting rid of it. 😢
Sorry I already have a focus rs project
Rule 5... i have a mk6 golf r... does it make me cool yet but i Love my golf r, just got done building motor and big turbo mk6! Came from the jdm scene to vw and I LOVE it! Went from a mk5 gti to my mk6 golf r!
I’m another 2k into my might as well
0:52 “so we can hang out” say less 🫡
obi wan carnobi😂😂
0:14 I dont know if replicated is the right word for a twin turbo V10 powered tube chassis covered in Golf 3 exterior parts🫶🏼😅
My first car was a 6n polo. Bought it for £600 learnt to drive in it then sold it for £600. Looking at the MOT history looks like it was scrapped for rust :(
sick
Yours and jps car are pretty same your right it has some kind of 5zyl too
You should put some *period correct* wheels on it! 😁  Sell those "classic looking" ROTIFORM wheels!
Every so often I go to a part of town near where I live and there a vw harlequin that just sits on this auto business lot
"...and my goal by the end of this video is the inflate the price" 😂😂
As a turkish (bad economy intensified) golf mkIV owner Im very happy about this video
3:25 my man
Im really trying to get into the VW scene, id love to get a mk7 later this year. Ive loved them since i was a kid playing nfs undergound.
As a Donut OG, I'd dearly love to see a collab with Zach and Jeremiah on this one. Nu-Donut just doesn't hit the same.
actually i am Bildung an golf mk3 VR5 here in Germany right now because your mk3 inspired me :D
"your parents probably wont let you buy a car this old" me with my 85 944 at 18 years old 😅  also be quiet about the 07k platform i need them to stay cheap so i can swap one into my 944 one day 👀😂
Are you or anyone you know looking for a video editor? I would like to be apart of something I enjoy.
You’re the guy from HIMYM!
Mk3 mk4 golf and jetta are the project for everyone. I personally prefer the jetta
Congrats man. I’ve got a 17 Jetta I bought to use as a service car for the business I’m starting. It’s a 1.4t and I’m gonna keep it that way but I’ll probably put a bigger turbo in and add a cold air intake and improve flow in and out. Might put it on bags someday but it’s a work car so I’m not doing a ton to it.   I have missed my 13 beetle turbo since I let it go and I love this car every bit as much even if it isn’t as fast.
For the love of god please do a AWD conversion 😂😂😂
There is nothing better than resurrecting a car that you thought was lost. Congratulations on this new corrected and improved project. 🎉
Too late already got one mk2 project
This car is sick
I feel like I've been brought... up to speed... about VW car culture.
I miss the forums
Brazil is the place to look for vw engine parts. Not sure about 5 cilinders but we've got the stuff for 4 cilinders
I had a 2010 gti and it’s still one of my favorite car I have ever owned.
Wustefest!! Miss my 98 Jetta GLX. Vw vortex was the shit . I documented my fiberglass headliner and visor TV build there
Loved this video, brought me back to my Mark iii days. Can’t wait to see the progress.
I don’t see James as a Jetta guy to be honest. I can picture him in a Porsche America 🇺🇸
i had a brand new mk5 gti..sucked me right in.  went to waterfest..what a bad ass time.
*_I need to find a 1st gen GTI Hatch… lmk who has one_*
Okay... I finally subscribed.  I love my old VWs and can't wait to be jealous of yours. 😏
Vag group forever
Omg the smoke at 21:35
As an 07k enthusiast, I really can appreciate the amount of love and notoriety he gives these motors.
I support this content so much... I might let you buy my Cult Society kit
welp now every golf is going to skyrocket in price :(
I love project cars!!!😎
Ayo!
Nice wallabees bro
I had an Audi A3 Diesel.  Never buy a VW product ... they're awful.
the exhaust rumble from a vr6 makes holds a special place in my heart
MOAR PWR BB!!!
hey man i have a mk3 euro hatch with cl glass if you know anyone shopping for one
Where's the clickbait engines blow up like Subaru videos get? <3
"stretch tires or pulled fenders are banned here, unless fender is that originally the cop will ticket you, warn you and if you get pulled over again, car taken and you have find a way home yourself, lol, same with tires that go outside the original chassi, not allowed USA got too much freedom, even in calinazifornia lol
I had a 16v MK II when I was much younger and miss it everyday.
Need to go see Concept 3 performance
Do a Rotary vid 🥺
Rabbit with a dumpy > golf with a butt
Boring grandma car, at least where I live.
Well already have a project golf 😎 a mk3 golf estate 1.9tdi
perfect timing just bought a mk6 gti 3 door manual hehe
My first car that I bought for me was a MKV Rabbit. I still have it but it just sits and everytime I think about what I'd like to do with it I am instantly reminded how utterly little I know about how to make it happen. I personally want to turn it into a Class B homage style rally car...but uh. I got no idea where to start lol
Had a 2000 JTI GLX VR6, wookies for days
*_LETS GOO 🔥_*
My goal is to get a VR6
I feel like James has been freed from the shackles of corpo content making and has found his old, slightly awkward, self and I am here for it. Good on you man. You seem honestly happy.
Bro you NEED to come to Soyth Africa. Our Vbud scene is huge
Does this generation smell like melted crayons, or is that just the MK4?
The live next to eachother? or he did not mean to point at the house?
James, speaking of the glory of forums,  other than vwvortex where you on ls or 502ss?
WATER BY THE BRIDGE!
So if a jetta is a golf with a butt, what does that make the golf? A buttless jetta?
Ohhh you missed the polo breadvan
Dark Matter rips, that book is so fun
As a fellow kentuckian....i don't agree with his love of VW's!
vw best bang for the buck?? he knocked his head somewhere
I call those instances where your motor, trans or car needs to be torn down the "While You're In There-ism's".
VW enthusiasts 🤝 Audi enthusiasts
That might as well is a daaaaaangerous game. It’s the best part of project cars.
The medium build cap made me love you even more. 12:29
I was convinced to get a golf project before this video started
hell yeah
Cartoon lookin lookin smoke 21:20
VWVortex LETS GOOO! Started there from the beginning! DTMTrini i think was my name at one point or another, i've had so many. I had a MKII Wolfsburg Edition in those days w/ manual everything including  manual sunroof!
3:45 James mentioned indirectly Tate😂
Now they won’t be cheap lol
Based city. Population: James
Hey James, if you need a good not rusted donor you can buy @xjamiexoe 's red Rolling Stones mk3. It's a car from Spain, so absolutely no rust. That's my first car, it would be an honor if you used it for your project.
Because I had a Golf GTI project of I known. I do understand
When are we hanging out?
Buy one with a manual!  The automatic in our '08 is garbage.
Volkswagen’s are the Honda Civics of Europe, change my mind
I have waited years for this! Let’s goooo!
We see bffs. VW mk3s the best
The MKIII is back baby! can you also get leonardo dicabrio back as well? 😂😂
LETS GOOOOOO! Cant wait to see this build.
It's back baby
I can't wait to see the build series on this. Please keep it the same color because I'm not a vw guy but it looks so good with the paint matched rims in this color
All right dude your real car with real content is what we want!   The gimmick stuff is okay but man it's much better to have the real stuff. The history lessons are cool, but it's really nice to see your car! That's the right direction
Why do older VWs seem to just disintegrate?
Does he have cancer or what the hell is going on? Looks like hammered shit.
Leave it to a Mk3 to rust in SoCal 😂 I'm glad to see you got your car back though. I'm excited to see what all happens here! Also 2000s VW tuning was huge, I lived in Minneapolis and would see builds at the Eurowerks show that would dictate styles I would see in Super Street 1-2 years later. 2.5L appreciation club!!! Closed deck, inline 5, iron block, its god's engine.
Yeah get a mk6 or lower. I got my mk7 for 12k but I’ve spend 10k because it breaks down all the time. Ac was 2k to replace. You’re going to start leaking oil after 100k miles.
I have a vw golf from 94 😅
“Ask your older cousin?” Bro I am the uncle 😂😂
I did really like the Scirocco black in the day. But when  it  comes to German cars 👎especially BMW. Many German cars are money pits.
Ha! Love this! I joined VWVortex back in 2001, good old times! Whatever happened to the VW scene????
I've had 8 Golf project cars over the past 30+ years.  Most fun and pain any vehicle can provide :)  MkI, V, VII are my faves.  My MkV with the 2.5L and exhaust sounded INSANE.  Now trying to find a clean MkI GTI for under 15k.
I have a Mk8. Best car I have driven.
Says golf is best for your buck but might buy a new chassis? Doesn’t make sense to me, golf is just trash
a MK3 VR6 will always be a favorite of mine. GTI or Jetta I dont care.
Got my first Golf Gti i love it ❤️ Mk8 Golf GTI
Im excited for this series! I have a rusty 1995 mk3 golf cl in my driveway. It starts, runs, drives, kinda stops but it is a rusty crusty girl. Originally purchased in Quebec, Canada and transported to BC, Canada in 2005. Im trying to sell it currently for $1000 but in the back of my mind id love to do a fun little build with it. Just dont have money to put into the car sadly im a broke boy. Im also trying to save for a type r b18c swap for my 2000 civic si coupe. Priorities unfortunately mean I will have to sell the car i grew up riding in as a kid, and the car I learned to drive stick with. If it was less rusty id probably try and store it and hold onto it until I can afford to restore it. I would need to do a lot of cutting and welding to make it safer though as the drivers strut tower has a nice rust hole in it lol. Hoping to sell it to put that money into my civic project. Im getting tired of walking to work in the cold lol hopefully I can get my civic on the road this spring/summer🤘💯
So stoked on this!!! Been watching for over 8 years now. Can’t wait to see what’s in store 💙
Dude, cool video. The trasion between you sitting in the driveway and whiteboard was a nice touch.   Please release like a YouTube short with YOUR G-Wagon, I'm a huge fan of old mercs and old VWs.
1. You almost said bitches (bad mamma jammas), and should have.  2. I had a MK2 jetta wolfsburg, and it was dope, loved it and should have kept it.  3. How does painter's tape not take dry erase marker off the board?
Ok wheres boosted Kaytea at?
I have the mk2 golf as a project had for the last 2 years and have made some great memories and great friends
Stoked to see this car come back to life!
You need Burt from science garage back.
If this thing doesn't come out the other side with six turbos ill be disappointed
Anyone know the track at 10:38? Song choices are amazing.
epic, this will work. congrats bro 👍
CLEETUS needs to do a Golf race at the FF
Hey james. Long shot question here but the VW magazine that had the cannonball on the cover, which article/edition was that? Id like to research it more to put on the spreadsheet of documented and historical cannonball times
Come to South Africa , VW is life here, you will love it . #mk1Boooooooy
Proud to be a Golf project owner since 2010! 🎉
Where AE86
I had an absolute shitbox, mk3 1998 VW Jetta as a first car, beat the hell out of it, ripped my exhaust off at the headers when i jumped a railway crossing, abused that thing and then gave it away to a coworker at the time who didnt have any wheels, regretted it ever since, just and the end of 2024 I purchased a new to me mk3 1995 VW Jetta and have fell in love again, yes its falling apart too, but the nostalgia is unmatched
This is great motivation to get my 69 beetle project going again, it’s been ongoing for about 7 years so this is pretty relatable
New adventure unlocked
literally bought a 84 rabbit mk1 2 months ago because i have always wanted one. The scene in the PNW was huge and I too wanted to get one to reminance and find other cool vw people around! Illinois where you at?!
haha funny, now put very bright lights on it
Man, James I remember those 2000s performance VW days, I still have a few 2003 era issues around somewhere.
You and Big Time need to do video series like Hi-Lo.. you vs them on a build..
Jaaaaaammmmeeees. James. Listen dude. I am with you so hard on this. I have a mk2. And she is my baby. Cant wait to see this project
Saying jp copied you 🤣🤣 with love
Golfs are good project cars unless it's a golf R32. Mine is a shitbox money pit
I’ll leave the Golf to you. But I’ll tag along for the ride. 😂
Your vids have always been so intriguing, just that kind that hooks you, without any sort of time awareness ☺️
As a mk5 gti owner, it's a hunk of junk, and I wouldn't swap it with anything else
mk3 golf prices after this vid 📈
WHAT SBOUT THE W-5??
After projects a done we need a race whit bigtime
vw golf mk4 3 and 2 are so good looking cars. modern day vw is so boring. vw is life vw is love.
YESS SEND THE PRICES UPP!!!
Golf isn't more complicated than a wheelbarrow...
16:45 shoulda went with Legion of Spool 👀
This video is making me rethink selling my mk7.5 gti lol
What brand are those wheels?  DP?
F****** but fixable. That was the singular best possible diagnosis. And absolutely ideal for a channel project car
I was always scared of them since every one my dad flipped had issues. Which stinks, because i remember loving the turbo Mk5 golf he brought home(had a boost leak).
There go my chances in getting a mk2 or mk1😊
the fact #4 wasn't "FAMILY" is disappointing.
Bump the MKIV GTI values up PLZZZZ I have one that has to go.
I miss my MK3 but i like my MK7 better.
goes to show that donut does not give 2 shits about cars.
Are you wearing twisted x shoes? If not look into them they're so comfortable.
Swap in a VR5 longitudinally with a B5 audi awd 01E 6 speed.....OR BUST! ONLY exception instead if VR5 is the AAA VR6 12 valve....best motors ever
Yessss I Cannot wait until next vid
Oh we are back baby !!!
Hell yeah finally some Vw content. James dm me i have some rare foglights that i will donate.
'bald red guy' lmao. also vw group ftw
3:25 Yelling "I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS" as your rotted mk3 hits highways speeds.
This car is why I followed donut and now James’s channel and why I bought my own mk3 last summer
Love this. I've got a mk3 golf for sale now in MN. It's rough because we have winter. Cheers 🥂
I am 29 and was started to watching  some vdub projects when was 14 th I am sad couz I wasn't buy any one vw or else car I literally thought I lost my life and my self. Really sad for me. I also saw how that was unpopular and was thought I was in that but in reality was no
Well, now you just made VWs expensive and cool again 😂❤
never had a goilf but it wa sa car iw as around allot at the time, frend had a poked out VR6, really nice cars
Making me miss my Mk.5 GTI
I'm super stoked to see you build on this car again. Hopefully you fix all the rust can't be any more excited to see this channel grow and flourish. It's videos like this that will get you up there. Thanks for the great content.
getting nordvpn (liars) sponsorship is quite hilarious in modern political climate
James single-handedly bringing back VW golf’s and wallabies.. what an icon 😮🤯
James single-handedly bringing back VW golf’s and wallabies.. what an icon 😮🤯
Idk 🤷‍♂️ , not a fan of the Euro, 😅
what california cars get that? i've never seen a california car get like that.
I'm more of a clio guy but it's good to see this thing back!
Just today I was working with my dad on our VW Passat 2.8 NA 4x4 sedan and now James posts a video. A truly great day
reject golf, drive a beetle
Damn those are expensive in US. I checked Finnish car marketplace site and found 2 MK4 GTI's and 2 MK5 TD GT's under 2k€, all road legal and MOT'd
Saw a VR6 that had M badges replacing the VW badging in courchevel the other day…strange
Definitely lighter than my srt4...
Its so nice to see a video here on YouTube about the mk3 😁👍 i myself have a golf mk3 vr6 color concept syncro  looking forward so see more videos from you! Keep up the good work 😀
Sick car.  Do a honda element swap.  By that I mean, swap the car to a Honda element.
Dude I bought Dark Matter a couple months the ago on a whim; and that’s the first book???? Crazy
mk5 rabbit owner :) got it last year and no joke it is the most thing i have ever driven!! Really look forward to more people developing some good kits for the 07k
whoever filmed the shoot outside the garage and the VW in the back video did an amazing job!!
Sir I have 2 71 triumph Gt6’s I don’t need golf….but 👀
I've had a Mk3 Jetta VR6 and a Mk4 Wolfsburg and I bought one for a grand and the other was given to me for free. One thing I loved about the cars was modifications and parts to fix it were relatively cheap. The VR6 had a side exit straight pipe and it was extremely rowdy sounding. The Mk4 had a blow off valve and other fun turbo bits. And as James said they all pretty much look fantastic. Never over done and busy designs. The downside (or upside if you love fixing stuff) of these cars is that everything breaks all of the fucking time. I don't mind working on my stuff every month but every weekend was exhausting to the point that I had to switch back to JDM stuff. All in all, I would rate my VW experience a 6.5/10 and I would recommend getting into it
YES! Guys are 100% back now.
James sitting on a stool in the driveway in front of the garage like hes Zach Jobe 🙄 also, talking about his "next project car" is laughable. Like he works on cars at all lol that is not the garage of a guy that works on cars
Medium Build FTW 😎
LA car with rust?
Fuckin legend.
I have a '85 Porsche 944 I'm planning on putting an 07k in! Now I'll have to get my engine before the price goes up on them 😅
I am in at the end of a 2.0 to a 1.8 T swap on a MK4 golf, I am definitely going to be keeping an eye on this series!
With my daughter getting her license soon, and she's actively shopping for cars, I may just convince her to get a VW.  I started my journey in auto-enthusiast world in VWs.  Mk1s, Mk2s, Mk3s, and it ended with a B5 Passat when I moved into other stuff.  But I really did love my VWs.
One year later and he finally released a car video
James, you look fantastic. Keep up the work, homie.
Those headlights are like the major reason I want one. Hatch with that is wild lookin, specially if you go for a beefy wide body rally inspired styled kit. Just looks like it's ready for anything, even though I'd be cutting quick corners through a city, at best.
Got an 83 diesel golf myself
My first car was mk5 gt tdi. Turbo was gone, suspension was gone, coolant was leaking and brakes was barely functioning. And i fucking loved to drive that shiftbox, so much fun.
Needs a 1.9 tdi with a turbo and supercharger and 2 step
Oh Boy. I moved over to a “reliable” Japanese car after 6 VWs and guess what? I miss my mechanic. Now I’m thinking of giving the Subaru to my wife and buying a MK6 GTI or R. I want to get back into having a relationship with my car, my mechanic and others (like James). Subscribed. (Btw, my VDubs were a Karman Ghia, mk1 Jetta 2-door ❤, mk 2 Jetta, mk3 golf❤, 2 mk 4 golfs and a mk 6 golf.)
I’ve been missing my Mk4 GTI a lot lately… this really feels like a call to action
i dont have a golf but i do have a mk2 tt which is based off the mk5/6 golf i got some plans for that car ngl
You ain’t wrong
Yay the golf is back
I don’t know man but this guy really know how to make complete package entertaining video ❤
What a chance this video came out, I bought my VW Golf MK1 GTI just a few weeks ago and its actually a import from America to EU, which makes it a bit fancier to drive a US Golf around the streets of Europe, the reason why I wanted one so badly is because my dad used to own a MK2 GTI and as a kid fell in love with it, we hope by the end of summer to finish this Golf and finally drive it around. And oh if someone has like the big US MK1 Lights laying around please send me a message it seems they are impossible to find anywhere
i was waiting for this , MOH POWAH BABEH!
Absolutely love how you doing this channel. So open-minded, creative and inspiring. Loved you on donut, but you killing it on your own.
Josh Scott from JHS Pedals does the same thing to price of vintage guitar pedals - makes video, price goes up!
I was planning on buying a GTI when I graduated from school and find a decent paying job. That's not gonna make financial sense after this video.
As an owner of a mk5 rabbit I will watch this series with great interest!  I can see his 07k already has valve cover and intake manifold (looks like from Integrated Engineering?)  So many civic build videos on YouTube, we desperately need more Golf/Jetta videos!
I just was looking at a GTI Golf in my work parking lot, before I came in and saw this video.
Vortex MK3 forums days… the best
H2Oi was one of the craziest show that will never happen again once the actual show was no longer around Ocean City just turned into a massive rolling stanced car show
Gotta do one on the Vw CC
I love my mk7 GTI project
Cabrio VR6 sitting im my driveway bud....vws started it all i agree. bro EuroStyle, ramondvw, KillerVR6GTI, VRsixVW. I remember afazz, purpleGTI all from vwvortex back in the early 2000s. I was MK3_Katinga back in those days. You just gave me the little push to document the cabrio build for sure.
You should check out @VolvoT5golf channel and his 8-second VW MKIII Golf.
I can’t lie, I love the other videos you been making and I can tell that you enjoy making them, but I’ve missed doing real car shtuff. My old man is/was a big vw guy when I was a kid and it makes sense now, I had no idea the scene was so big back then
When i was in high-school in 2005 one of my buddies had a jetta diesel. Not tdi, no turbo. He put motegi's on it and i slapped a cherry bomb on it. Then another dude had me slap a flowmaster on his v6 grand am in the student parking lot. I was always tinkering on my volvo 240, I've had like 20 of em now. I'd race a dude in a 1g neon almost every day omw to school, he did a burnout in front of the liquor store parking lot we were all hanging out in and snapped an axle. One kid had a beretta with i stg stovepipe dual exhausts. I miss doing dumb teenaged shit lol
Speeed/ Big Time collab when? Just 3 dudes wrenching/BS'ing?
James + old German car = immediate view
I play with 90's car's and still listen to Taking Back Sunday
My golf is best golf because its pretending to be an audi
I wish these cars were made by literally any other car company in the world because they seem to have a lot of what I want in a car but I could never have a Nazi car.
Man the whole dub scene in the 90s was epic, Waterfest was my jam and man what I wouldn't give to get any of my MK2 GTIs back
I’m here for car content and car content only!Welcome me back!!
Let's go
Welp guess I’m selling my truck for another golf 😃
I would LOVE to hang out with you, but the big problem for me is the distance from Germany to the states 😅Also I just finished restoring my 92 Opel Calibra - though it would look nice next beside your legendary Golf 👌
peak
You convinced me.. until I remembered that I have an Abarth and two Fiats. Enough fun for me to be busy fixing every Saturday.
fuckin siiick
2:36 bro forgot bmw … it was vw who did it first or best
Dude you look too skinnier, are you ok?
Yo, James!..  Fuck yeah dude. Follow your dreams and never change.
I have a 99 MK3 jetta 2.slow that is my pride and joy. Lots of work getting it running only for my tranny to take a poop but I wouldn't trade or sell it for anything
Love this video man. I totally understand the sentimental value of your favorite car. I had a ‘14 Legacy I lost 3 years ago and it’s still my phone background lol. I had plans for a VR swap and then a tree took out the car. RIP Susie🚙 the project stays on the bucket list for now.
Wheres vin_tra?
Mike Burroughs mentioned????????
5-cylinder engines are such a hidden gem. Equally enthusiastic to VW are the Volvo owners on the P1, 5-cyl platform. The C30 hatchback and V50/V60 wagons were bona-fide turbo rippers with over 230hp stock, and the S40 sedan was a great daily for the normies. They came in stick and AWD variants too, and many components were Ford MC crossover, meaning parts aren't really all that crazy to find. Good to see the love.
dude plase trow front lights away....  Jesus christ this is awful
I would love to buy one but uh..people love to try an make you overpay for this shit, so ;w;
seeing this video a couple months after i sold my golf damn near brought a tear to my eye
Golf sales after this video 📈📈📈
Are golfs fast? What’s fun about them
You should come to South Africa. VW is like the stock standard car that everyone uses for project cars. Our roads are flooded with VW Golfs and even the old Rabbits.
ffffffiinnaalyy . dont get me wrong , the up to speed vids are fire but this sort of things is on  whole other level...
I've had my Facelift 2015 Jetta TDi for nearly 5 years now. Supporting mods and tastefully lowered, rims n' rubbers, learned how to wrap vinyl on it, some mad electrical for engine bay lighting, and only summer driven. Still had less then 60k miles on it :P Keep the vibe alive my friend! Mad love for VW, mad love for Speeed <3
I agree with many of your points. fell in love with a mk1 cabriolet, then i passed on to mk1 diesels dailyed that for 10 years, now I have a mk6 diesel as my daily after some modifications. Kept my 2 door 86 mk1. Selling my 4 door 82 mk1 and planning on swapping a 2.5 into it. Keeping it NA and hoping to do a custom speeduino EFI system.
Mk4 if you dont wanna battle rust
I agree 1st car I ever worked on was a VW Jetta mk2 and made me to study to be a mechanic
I’m all about the Scirocco life 💪🏼
broo growing up in mexico theres so many vw enthusiasts, gtis and r32s everywhere. when i moved to the us my dream car was a mk5 gti now that i own it at 18 and got it at 17 its been nothing but learning and having fun cuz like any vw enthusiast ive blown engines and turbos lol
Pro tip: All of top gear is free on BBC Iplayer but you need a British VPN to watch
How get car for dunkin donut
In South Africa. Almost all car shows and events have about 50% of the vehicles being a golf or polo variant 😂
I am glad you like VW’s like this but man, between those and all these other YouTubers doing Hondas….oof, big ole’ yawn. 😕
I'm not a big Volkswagen guy but my favorite has to be Mk5 Golf, Caravelle, and 2012 Scirocco and have seen couple of Sciroccos (and i think they're neat). Meanwhile my uncle is into restoring older VWs like old Beetles and Bus/Kombi (or Type 2) and turned them into many variations. Some Kombi had their wheelbase stretched out and i think they've built a replica of Porsche Type 64. Some with interesting mashup like turning a Suzuki Katana (2-wheel drive Jimny) into a Safari/The Thing. The name of the channel is Yumos Garage if people might wanna take a look
T SHIRT SHIPPED!
can you meet whit your bros from big time
Hmmmmm i didnt know vw and performance belonged in the same sentence or even paragraph....
8:40 "Community" This is so underrated. Not just the Golf, Volkswagens in general. Car scenes tend to be really cliquey with people staying around others in their niche, but VW has just been wholly different. I met some of my best friends and some of the weirdest assortment of people in general because of Volkswagens. Relators, Mechanics, Rally drivers, bankers, trades guys, retail, sales, hell even a local politician. You got your GTI hotboys, Old school MK1/2 guys who have been there for decades. The Van and Beetle hippies, The niche VW SUV overlanders. The people with stock VWs who are just as welcome and part of the club as the super modified Golf and mint collector Van people. The community is next level.  I moved to a new city and on the drive I had my exhaust get ripped off in a construction zone. Posted in the local VW Facebook group that I had just arrived in town and had nowhere to fix. Had multiple replies in minutes with driveways and tools I could use. The guy who's house I rolled up to let me use his tools, helped me crawl around under the car, even hooked me up with some Audi summer wheels and tires so I could get off my winter tires. For free. I had just met him.
Calling JP Performance's r8 reare engine swapped monster that is vaguely related to a golf 3 a replica is kinda crazy 0:15
3:57 23 years later I recognize at least half of those names on that forum.  I lived on vwvortex for years, good times.
common James W
I had a 93 CL. I loved that car…sadly it died in 2004, then life happened, wife, kids etc. would love to get another
James chill bro imma have to pay an arm and a leg for mk3 parts after this, man, let's keep them undervalued 😂😂
HELL YEAH DUDE ive been waiting for vw stuff from you
Did anyone notice the ULTRA RARE 90s ES300 @16:06 ?
I'd like to add a qualifier to your statement from the beginning of the video: as long as it's not the mk8 (because that UX is a crime against humanity)
Old school member of LouisvilleVW here. Owned 20 VWs and used to bring my MK1 Jetta, Cabby’s and MK1 GTI to meets all the time. Also doing head swaps in my Mk2 Jetta 16v in alley behind Doo Wop Shop off of Bonnycastle. Hanging out at Professor Nate’s house learning how to mod crazy shit back in the day.
49 and all I’ve ever owned are vw’s and Audis…90’s was my hay day! Haha who else had a sick vw with NEUSPEED across the windshield? And kinda bummed he didn’t mention a European Car magazine subscription.
Currently working on a 82 VW Derby.......mk1 through mk3 Golfs are awesome .
Honestly my favorite video since you left donut. I'm a vw guy tho. Love your content bro. Best wishes
I miss the old school vw days
21:35 You casually smoked out the entire garage and possibly part of the neighborhood lol
Dude I love the framing at 1:58 ! It shows both you and the car and the lighting highlights the beauty of the car but also what needs to be done for it. You also got a  really cool fit going
to my fellow europeans, the MK3 Jetta here was the Volkswagen Vento
Love all the other content on Speeed, but OH YEAH am i ready for some car content with James, OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH
THIS. THIS is what this channel needs.
OK, when you told that MK3 Golf looks sick, I had to stop watching..... THE UGLIEST golf ever made(and I'm not a hater, I had BMW Compact and I loved it). Too late to be iconic like MK2 and too soon to be OK as MK4.
go in "wookies in woods" with your golf
This seems like an attempt to raise the market value hahahaha
4:51 I once paid over $6/gal for gas at the Chevron in Jean, NV
LOVE all James’s content! BUT James’s car content….unmatched
I miss my 0k7 08 rabbit time for another i believe :)
I can tell you really love making this video and I am loving it
H2o some of the best times EVER!
Been waiting since Money Pit to see this video.  James X VW = WIN
So stoked to see this car make a comeback   I’ve only been bugging you on instagram for a couple of years 😂
I'm really excited for the rivian r3x
Hey! I just bought myself a Brazilian VW GOLF MK4 2.sl0w as my first car, then THIS VIDEO POPS ON MY FEED? im feeling blessed.
As a former MK3 owner, I do miss mine, but I do not miss how poor handling of a car it was, even with modifications.  They're profoundly front-heavy, and have terrible suspension geometry.  The suspension can't be lowered without introducing lots of bump-steer, and the geometry of the suspension compressing affects the camber too much.  I tried to make one into an Autocross car, and it was a lost cause.  Honda Civics ran circles around me with much less work done to them.
YES DUDE A GTI has always been my #1 car since i wreck mine in college and im literally shopping for one right now, this is perfect timing for me
I mean, all great reasons to buy a Miata too! Lol. Love ya James glad to see you making the stuff you care about.
VW Vortex helped save my old GTI and R32 from the scrap yard😂. Those cars are long since sold, and I've moved on from Volkswagens, but I can still vividly remember going on VW Vortex out of desperation to get my two cars fixed.
Anyone know what car is James driving side by side while taking the golf to the chopshop ?????
Song at 10:38 = Wild Life by Rain Jewels
I was JUST looking for VW golfs, thankfully there's no shortage of them in western europe
I have a mk6 Jetta I love this car
or even Communinity....
Imagine having a project that's wrong wheel drive lololol
Welp. Convincing my dad from NOT selling our Mk2 Jetta which literally is leaking fuel onto the oil pan (dont ask how, it simply happens, i swear the rings are okay), but i have this weird concept to make it RWD and swap whatever does fit without modifying the engine bay lmao  (That car had a rough life. I once saw a race-prepped Jetta... and i simply wanted to make my parents' one like that lol)
Just a shameless plug here, at 8:10 appear one of the most famous Mk3s in the spanish scene, whose owner is a legend, he is on YouTube (@aeromagic) and worth checking out.   Other than that, nice nerdy video James, as a fellow 90s VW nerd, I appreciate...🥰
shame you guys never got the Scirocco
IMO one thing that deters new comers is they are different to fix. I dont want to say harder becuause i find them easy has hell. If you are coming from any kind of domestic JDM world working on these cars can feel like a task. Every turn you take you will need an odd ball tool - Granted once you have what you need i think these things are some of the most simple things to work on.
My dad bought a mk3 Jetta 2nd owner back in 97 when I was in 1st grade. So my childhood dream was to get a mk3 golf gti
Nah, the 2013 Honda Accord V6 is the best bang for your buck. It has 278HP. A 10HP increase from the last generation and putting a turbocharger on it make it super fast.
After you blew it up, it sounded like every car in my town.
Vw golfs are really cute cars.
Excited to see the golf return to its former and beyond better glory
i bet James listens to Bilmuri.  you guys need to check Bilmuri out if you haven’t discovered them yet
J-pump Golf meet needs to happen..
No mention of crubs, fents, load cam knock or LumberJetta. Sus.
This is what I have been waiting for!
Dreams of being on PVW…the owner of PVW is the one that brought the car to the states.😂
Volkswagens are like GM F-Bodies that cater to Millennials instead of Boomers
You should throw a VW car meet car show. I’m in Cali got a mark7 Gti and love it and would love to go to a VW event
Hey james  your golf  looks awsome  please name it  chloe
so glad to see this car back with James. such relatable content, keep up the good work!:)
I've had a mk3 GTI since I graduated high school in 2017 and it's still my daily till this day got me through college and everything. Absolutely love it and I think it's time for another GTI so I can restore that mk3
I had a Mk3 back in my early 20s. It was free and my first manual. Loved that car until it rusted apart. Befriended my best man over that car. Recently got my second, a Mk7.5 GSW 4MOTION with 2.0 IS20 swap, all the bolt on goodies and a Golf R interior. So happy to be back in the VW game.
It's sad donut had to break itself up to go back to real content... to bad it's all still donut and not these guys being truly independent
More people need 1.9 tdi supremacy
It’s so fulfilling to see you that excited about your car man. Couldn’t be happier for you 👏
should put "Might as well" on garm dude
Car Content ❤
no.1 reason not to buy one.... they are actual rust buckets. Dont get my wrong. I love my 1994 Golf GTI Mk.III Edit: Cant wait to follow along with this series. Love you James!
i am always here for vw content!!!!
Thanks for the love man! HYPED you got her back! LMK If I can help :)
I own a mk8 gti clubsport in germany where all gti's get hated because of social Media but i love it and its awesome
I've been fighting to save my MK2 ...lots of tears but not giving up. Looking forward to seeing James's MK3 restored
More speed/ Castro collab please
I wish i could've met James when i had a VW
mk7 here; don't have to convince me. 😎👉👉
Im definitely here for the vw rebuild
Anyone else seeing the decline of donut?
James pumpfree as in he'll pump you for free then it's a hundred bucks a pop
vdubs on topppppppp
Everything we need to know to get up to speeed on the VW Golf
Lets goooooooo!
Even here in Argentina we all were in vw vortex. I had a 95 mk3 gti, long live golfs!
I had a jetta vr6 with a manual trans for 3 days before the motor blew up. I wasnt even beating it up.  Edit: the interiors of most VW's smell like crayons for some reason.
Pumped to see this bad boy come back to life and get on that cover! All the best of luck!
Let's get up to speeed!
Subscribed because of this video. I am pumped to see more of this build until it gets its well deserved PVW magazine cover! It even makes me feel like I am part of this build for some reason. Btw...I was in VVwortex and I used to own a 1997 GTI Vr6 Drivers Edition Ginster yellow. I still miss it to this day, I shouldnt have gotten rid of it!
but they are german? they are reliable??
I love Golfs, I've had 2, BUT the last one I had was a POS. It was reliable but literally every time I got in it something fell off or broke. I'm not exaggerating. Switches, trim, handles, seat parts, locks, wipers, mirrors, everything. Anything that wasn't the engine or gearbox, broke, ripped or fell off.
Thank you sir.
Such great news! Looking forward to the build progress!
My mom had a mk4 2.0 5speed jetta for 250k miles until the timing belt snapped and now I own a Audi A4 B6 1.8t Cabriolet. Love VW!!
My first car was a 98 gti vr6 drivers edition and it was by far my most favorite car. I rolled it end over end and swear to this day it saved my life. These cars are fast, fun, reliable (mostly) and safe. Miss mine everyday
James, I already got a gti project car… It’s costing my $1500 in maintenance every other month 😂
my mk3 GSX  is a south African model in flash red with a 1.8 8 valve its my daily with 215 k 2nd mk3 I've owned trust if I could id own another 1
oh hell yeah!
I didn’t know anything about Castro until I drove to their shop to buy an e36 from one of their mechanics, they definitely know how to build a great car 👌
Stop it! I already have 2 mk4's to take care of, don't make me get a mk3
G-Wsgon lol
i would like to know the costs of all this. your friend does not look cheap, but he seems to be very good.
We missed you on the "driving every version of the golf" vid
bought 2.. thanks for the stonks
And the channel loves you back duder!❤
Might have to get a mk4 and follow along 🤔
I have a T5 transporter with the 2.5 Tdi engine.  She can GO!
damn, my first car was a gen 5 jetta and i totaled it. i had so many plans for it. i guess i’ll just have to get another one
I have a mk2 golf cl , it's a never ending project but I love it
stoked. Boar out the cilies a mill or two, bigger pissies, check the crank journals, machine them to spec if necessary, adjust the rod bearings, balance everythinig and boom, youre good to go.
I was in the euro scene back in 2008-2012 and the vdub kids were always pushing the boundaries as far as style went. A ton of trends were either started or popularized by the vdub community.
golf sounded like a bomb
My mk3 four door golf is a beautiful driving car and everyone’s thinks it’s gay untill they drive it lol
FWD tho 😬  I just can't do it anymore. I want fun with my vehicles that FWD just can't offer me no more.
It pretty slick that the ad roll was incorporated wiithin the same same video, versus creating a new video staged video and cutting it in.
Obi-Wan Carnobi: We can rebuild it. We have the technology.
I had a bunch of "I ❤ Vortex Haters" stickers made for me and my friends back when i had a b5 a4 hahaha
Was that a trinity shirt? You from the neighborhood bro?
Did not expect him to give a subtle shoutout to taking back Sunday lol
As someone who got into the vw scene is 2007/8 this video is a huge nostalgia trip. Waterfest was a great time.  Also I've been looking for a clean rust free mk3 for a decade and im convinced they have all been crushed or parted out.   Rip vwvortex
In a way, I guess I'm part of the VW community... I have a Ducati, a brand that is owned by Audi... that is own by VW! See!? 🤣
I have one or three "golf" or golf like projects, including a GTI, golf, and rabbit.
My 2002 Golf Chico is my baby, i have big plans, just need time and cashflow to support my dream😂🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
I finished high school 2002. Mk 1 golfs were super popular then cause they were still manufactured here in south africa till then believe it or not 😅 great times oh and just about every one had a cone filter
Mk 3 Jetta was my first car way back in the day. I'm not a VW guy now, but I'll always have a soft spot for them because of that car. It was rad af.
I was in a video by JAMES HOLY 💩💩💩💩💩 8:50
mk5 gti here, i can say that i’ve had the most fun in this car than i’ve had in any other. the only problem im having is that my car is having throttle issues and i’ve yet to figure out what’s wrong :/  cars are pain
With this car and the microphone I’m glad you aren’t running from your donut past. You are building on the foundation you established there
Dude wish I knew this I went Honda and currently doing a 2001 civic. Honestly going to be nightmare but I’m gonna love it lol
Hell yeah James!!
I'm down for a project, golf or otherwise, but my current budget is... (Opens wallet, bats fly out)... Not good
If you can rescue low car to make her actually look and perform optimally that'd be great
Currently have my Mk3 GTI in the body shop getting painted 💚🇩🇪
7:00 Answer is Mercedes Benz!
2025, VW vids.  We are so Back
old VWs about to start getting expensive lol
Collab with BigTime???
Link to the discord please!
i have an oportunity to buy a VW golf 3 with a 1.9 diesel (non turbo) for 400 euro, idk if its worth it what do you guys think? 2 door 2 seater btw.
I just took ownership of a MKV R32 Golf :) how convenient
30 seconds in and i already want one then he tells me hes gonna make me want one
Target audience hit. Had many Golfs and currently have a Mk1 Polo with a Sorg Motorsport equipped 1.3. Also love Taking Back Sunday.
"Girls liked them" – *shows video of girls on an Audi*. story of my life.
I love my 2018 GTI. Modded IS38, full bolt ons and tune is plenty of power for the street(400+). I also get mid 30 mpg on trips and it's comfortable.
4:56  ermmm pump and dump scheme, you want more ppl to raise the prices so you can profit 1000$. Ontuyu
Haha, that's my article! Look at me mom
Yall need to keep quiet on the O7k stuff. Keep the prices LOW!
It’s fwd…
I wish I could watch "everything you need to know" videos again for the first time. Or do more new ones on this channel since that is what made so many of us start watching Donut to begin with.
Those new golfs with AWD and DSG are bolt on super cars. Tarded fast for such little money.
Currently stocking parts to start my rebuild on my mk4 337 edition this year will be the revolution of VW
Digggin' it brotha! Ill get my 66 buggy going and be at the swap one day🤟😅
VW is not only a brand! it's a way of lifestyle or community.
Now that you got the golf, we need an update on the 86
Hmm. dunno.. The MK3 is the worst one imo... We got a 04' vr6 TT last week - thats pretty sweet and better than the golf. I did shaved engine bays and what not in the early 80's on my VW's and Toyotas and have been a Vortex guy from way back, and Audizine later. I do like that 5cyl. VR5 even cooler. PS, friends don't let friends put cars on bags... How'd that thing get so freaking rusty? Heck that's as bad as my Michigan VWs from way back. Rockers are easy. Get out the sawzall and mig welder. Doesn't count if you have somebody else do the work!
I didn’t know James was Jamaican. What he know bout Clark’s?
WE SOOOO BACK
There’s no convincing! I had a mk4 TDI and LOVED IT
You should get it undercoated after you get the rust repaired. Definitely worth the money.
Golf Gang! <3
Why no love for the iconic mk2?
I have a gold project, sort off 😂 My brother in law has a mk5 golf 1.9 tdi that blew its motor, we managed to get hold of a write off 2018 Golf GTD that is going to lend its engine and drivetrain so the mk5 can live again, when we get around to it anyway 😂
11:47 Tribute to Paul Webster aka 'Websnowbo' in PVW
What kind of shit materials did they use for a car to rust in CA.
Hey thats my car
Used to only watch throttl, now I only want to watch this car get rebuilt! Greetings from Ireland mate!
5:15 “I’m not tryna save the scene, I’m tryna make the scene... Put that on garm.” 😎  Boom, new t-shirt merch. Love it. Easily becoming one of my favorite youtubers.
You're gonna look back on these and think... What the fuck was i thinking with the pink mic. Just a thought???
James channel is one of the only channels i watch legit smiling
Can we get a cameo from Big Time?
THX for the vid, its wholesome as allways !
I dont even like vw but i like you guys and i like cars. So im lovin this.
We had a 98 golf 4door with a passat swap that had forged internals a stand alone and 30psi of boost😅 it had 375 whp. It was fun and fast af until the atlas bearing decided to leave the chat😅
Dude I love wallabies
James is back!
Great vid as always.  But, your crafty word play and mind tricks had no effects on me this time.  Looking forward to updated content on this project.  Respect to the VW Golf community/culture.
Love it! Currently working on my MK3 too. Let’s bring back the good times
I have a 2013 Jetta TDI and I am super excited to be picking up an 03 GLI soon!
Great, now I'm looking for a mk2, I HAVE TO AIR COOLED VWs that are NEGLECTED already lmao
Kentucky? TBS? Bulldogs Cafe mosh pits? Headliners?
"might as well" 4wd mod?
James, i loved your video, but on the nordvpn ad, you clicked on spain and showed japan and clicked on guatemala and showed argentina... please be less american...
Me and a drive way full of broken down MK1's: Alright Cars lets make this scene happen!
Cant wait
Hell yeah, the video series we’ve all been waiting for!
Having spent my whole life in New England I was like "What rust?"
I'd be all in, if I hadn't already been bitten by the Cult of Mazda.  I have an NB to finish!
There is a guy in my neighbour hood taking a Golf-IV into a GTR spec.  Its a great platform (rust dependent).
So excited to see this car coming back. I had a mk3 vr6 back in the day.
Let's Build some CARS Baby! Can't wait to see this going! I look at MK2, 3s and Corrados DAILY.
I used to hate VW for no good reason, then I somehow ended up spontaneously buying a 2016 GTI, crashed it a last year and had to sell, and now all I want is to be back behind the wheel of one
Aint no way the Passat 3b/3bg didn't get mentioned
Man, I had a MK4 ALH that I loved dearly and sold it for a MK7.5 R, which recently got written off by a deer strike. This video just made me miss it all over again.  The VW crowd is a passionate one and I might have to try to find a MK3 or 4 so I can get back into it.
My dad is thinking about giving me is old ranger, it’s like a 04. If I do get it I might 5 cylinder swap it. Feel like that’s an interesting swap and it would be a fun experience. In my eyes the engine would fit not problem. If I could get some ideas that would be great
Another great reason to buy a Golf.... they all look great with just its belly lowered to the ground.
I used to have a sick ass 400hp 2014 GTI. Great car great community, I really miss my golf
THE MK3 IS BACK LETS GO
Sup James
Once you buy 1 they’re hard to get away from. Mixing and matching parts from different gens/platforms is the best part.
cyberpunk 2077 it but luxury style.
you convinced me in the first 50 seconds wanted that to be my first one anyway and my grandma wont hate it
E30 heaven
I bought a mk6 Jetta sportwagen solely because it was the most modern 5 cylinder wagon you can get. I absolutely adore and love my wagon! The 5 speed manual is a bit of a dog at times, but I'll take it over an auto 100 percent of the time. In all honesty, I waited for months for the right example to show up for sale, but it was worth it. I guess that makes the Jetta wagons with the 5 cylinder, 5 speed pretty rare. It's a forever car for me, and (as you do) I have a semi-extensive list of mods planned😎
Nice! My first car was Golf GTi edition, it was so sick!
I just wanna say I already wanted a mk2 golf  before this video but now it’s solidified. hopefully I can find a decent one in the Midwest, rust is a bitch
Finna buy an mk5 and meet up. Where u at?
Did you say your car was undocumented? I’m calling ice.
If you're about that VW life, you need to show your punk butt up to Wookies or Volksfest, man and stop frontin'!
this video found me at a very vulnerable time in my life where i spend 1 hour every day looking at vr6 passat wagons on facebook marketplace
I have a 95 EJ Civic , can we still hang out?🥺
just bought a Golf R Anniversary Edition, dont think ill get another car again in my life
Not going to be cheap now lol. But the real question is this. Trying to raise the price of the bw scene, what is he trying to lower lol
so excited for you and happy to see you ecstatically working on a car again. cant wait to watch this project unfold!
which reminds me.. what happened to your AE86?
This channel desperately needs a latin-american VW Gol Quadrado
rip H2OI :(
Sick!
Of the Donut refugees, you have the most obvious passion. Not a giant VW fan, particularly the Golf - every damned hippy had one! But your contagious enthusiasm made me sub, and I'm here for the ride!
Im not gonna lie, im 19 and wasnt around for so much of the vw communities history but hearing about h20i and how vw modding basically started the jdm scene does make me wish i was able to experience thise things in their peak, and also, if you own a vw and are young, like 16, you better be prepared to dive deep fixing random issues that pop up
Mk3 are so underrated there the most slept on golfs they live in Mk4 shadow
8:37 "commuinity"
Hehe, Golf on the bed of "All American Towing" :D
where my VW Fox fans at!!!!
18:39 my life lmao ❤😢
I love my mk7.5 golf, I plan on doing a bunch of daily centric mods
Sadly idc about vw see u next episode lad
OG VWvortex head here, boy did that place teach me just about everything I needed to know to get up to speed on my Mk1 Scirocco 😉
early 2000’s Vortex member, checking in, and psyched for this project.
Just kinda funny that the whole ad, is filmed in a G wagon...
That corrals at 2:13🤤
This is the content im subbed for! glad to see you have your car back!
15:56 I like how he just presses the horn on purpose for the sake of the sponsor
Crazy. I remember the day you bought it. And i am just some random guy in WA state. You have inspired so many james. Never stop
ay I got a 91 golf project, when we hangin out? 👀
VW finally on the channel! Leeets gooo
Mk2 Montana Green GTI 07K owner ... fully agree this is the time for the Golf project car. These motors are hilariously fun and in a light small car...just hilarious to drive.   Sorry your golf has taken so many hits from soccer balls and bumps from cars. Loved the colour...
I have been waiting for you to do this for so long my dude. Thank you thank you thank you for getting back to this!
i need an older vw lol currently my "project" is a Mk5 Jetta Wolfsburg with the 2.0 TSI, and ill say that car is the most fun car i've ever driven. ive owned the car for 5 years before that a 2011 2.5 jetta. im a vw fan for life for sure.
james, i love this channel too, dude! it's like hanging out with a homie who loves knowing things about things as much as i do. cannot wait to see this beautiful little nugget resurrected!
Rust trigger warning pls next time, it was too up close and too sudden man
hell yea
Sorry, Honey. You'n junior gots'ta gew... Daddy's getting a project car!
😎🤘🏼
hell yeah brother
5:12 The car scene should go back to how it was. Takeovers are shit, too many youtube and google mechanics/wanna e know-it-alls, low quality car shows, no originality, no personality, people chase the price tag.
Lol ...I still have my mk4 VW Jetta GLI with the VWVortex sticker. I owned it since 2009. Before that I drove a mk5 Rabbit. I use to be active on VWVortex. Met some good people on there. I got the nostalgia feels when James mentioned Performance VW magazine. I still got them in my cabinet somewhere. Anyone remember EuroTuner magazine? Anyway, my Jetta GLI has the 24v VR6. I have a love/hate relationship with it but I've learned a lot from it.
Hopefully James sees this comment . I love your Clark’s! Those some nice desert brown Wallaby’s you got on. Real good taste in fashion. From “a humble 🇯🇲’can”
Yeah... ill stick with the old acuras and hondas
Seeing your health and overall happiness improve has been honestly what scratched what id say was an itch for more up to speed episodes. Do not change...apart from the fact that you must praise Dale more
i have a mk6 jetta with a 5spd base asf abs went out reach out if anyone wants it (id love to see it O7K swapped or just slammed to it balls on wheels)
I dont have a golf but i got a 73 bug, wish they were cheaper to work on...
I see VW I give thumbs up
Dude, that's not that much rust. You're just not used to seeing tons of rust. You still have rocker panels and don't have giant holes in the floor.
That hardbody at 11:30 tho…😅
My first and only car was a 01 MK4
James, I got too many Golfs already 😅
It’s a dream of myn to k swap a corrado that’s alpine white with an alpine head unit.
I'm latin american, particularly from Argentina, and here (along with Brazil) there are tons of people that love VW, but particularly VW Gol (not Golf) and Bora (Jetta in the US). Because of that, there are CRAZY builds here
I’ve been inspired to buy a Jetta now thank you James 🫡
I just sold my Mk4. I cry a lot now.
instruction unclear, bought a tiguan
Wait until you know they’re a whole lot cheaper on Mexico
Nothing is more relatable then the car guy “might as well” my 5th gear synchro when out last week so I might as well get carbon synchros and dog gears and do the whole 6speed right….right!!
PVW definitely did feature audis
Working on old sh*tboxes with James, we're back baby, the world is healing.
Mk3 are the most slept on golfs
Please call the channel "Mo Powah Babeh" or "MPB"
U know what.. u shoud also get a vanagon
15:50 no way you honked in traffic🤣
My guy never heard of an AU Falcon...
Mannnn. I miss ocean city H2O weeks in the early 2010’s. Used to be so much fun. Now it’s just a revenue cash grab for all the ticketing cops.
0:14 Replicated? Last time i checked yours doesnt havea mid mounted v10 pushrod suspension etc... The car in the picture is the G3 from JP performance in Germany the picture was taken at essen Motor Show
So much love man, VW guy here too.  Been attending Wookies in the Woods since 2016.  You should make an appearance, it's a LONG way from you but probably still one of the best VW enthusiast events in the US.
James you gotta see our South Africa golf mk1 you'll love them ❤️
Get a mk4 scrub
Damn these videos are beautiful. The quality, the cool factor, the style (James always has that shit on) are on a completely different level. Not many channels have that mysterious x factor. That thing that makes you absolutely extatic when new video drops. Congrats to James and everyone else responsible for creation of that channel for making something different, yet in a way familiar. It has that hanging out with a cool homie/older brother vibe. Keep doing what you're doing
"Might as Well" shirt would hit so hard
We missed you, but now, you're back, and you're about to be better than you ever were, for sure. Welcome back, James' MK3 Golf. The king is officially back, baby!
dang someone lost a bit of weight
Should make it awd
Honestly, I think the wheels that are on there are already *sick*. And definitely don't change the color on the body, because it's crazy cool!
I bought a mk4 gti 1.8t 4 years ago and dont regret all the money i put into it
I used to have an 89 GTI and it was a big ol piece of 💩…but I loved it!!!  It was quite rusty and had like 220,000 miles on it but it was fun!  Was basically straight piped so it was pretty loud too 😂 🚗 💨
Lovely times when a well looked after Golf III was 300€ in Germany.
I would start with a new used engine, you can pick those up for nothing, they are everywhere. If you want to see more 5 cylinder stuff, check out CO Motorsports YT channel. They do awesome things.
0:42 “My Goal” to send the prices of the Golf TO. THE. MOON!  Is how you should have ended that sentence. 😂😢😢
I got mine for  800 bucks, its a 86 Mk3 gti 4 years ago !!!!!!!
I had a big booty golf (aka jetta), but it was a mk4 24v vr6 gli. And I learned so much from VW Vortex!.
No shit, earlier in this video I was like “James seems like he would like Medium Build”. Then you’re wearing a MB hat a few minutes later😂😂
I would be pissed if I got my car back with a bunch of dents that weren't there before and the door won't close tf did they do to your car dude!
Hey James I’m a huge, your up to speed videos on donut got me into cars and I haven’t looked back since and honestly I still watch them from time to time. I’m from Wisconsin and we have a huge car festival here called Automotion, and I think you and the boys at Big Time should come out with your project cars!
afuera!
moar powwah baybie! shpeeed!
James.... The Golf MK3 from JP-Performance has nothing to do with yours... Are you out of your mind? theres is a Audi turbo V10 in a complety tube frame... not one proportion matches a normal Golf Mk3.... PLEASE CORRECT THAT. Dont throw Shade on my guy....
Got an 87 mk 2 gt  4 door I’m building in memory of my daughter that passed from SIDS. Looking for a vr6 motor and transmission right now.
there you go james now we talking
sold my MK4 to my brother a while ago. He did some fun stuff with it but I think some mice got into it. Hoping he'll give it back to me instead of scrapping it at the junkyard. Maybe I can resurrect it.
Always wanted a Volkswagen Golf I’m going to buy one instead of a motorcycle
Please don't make me buy a fourth car
In EU (Poland especially) u can buy a mk3 running and drivin even good condition for roughly 1k $. The best time to buy them is now.
It looks the year 2000
come check out my 04 w8 6 speed any time you want. i just hit 87k miles. car runs perfect.
Everyone one my age in my area either drive cool domestic cars (which I like to think I got) or v-dubs and I kinda wanted one for a while so maybe I should get one
Ohhhhh snap James getting back into the Automotive game!? Here we go kids this about to get interesting!
This is great man the perfect video I wanted to see  I just purchased my very own Mk 3 gl and I’ve never been more excited  (I love it already)
“Might as well” could be new merch line lol
My first car was a mk 3 Golf a white one and then my second car was a mk 3 Golf a dark blue one and I absolutely loved it it felt so much more solid than all my friends cars when they had started first driving
Mannnn throwback to the vw vortex days! I actually owned the mk5 gti that was owned by the dude who ran vw vortex just a few years ago. I need another one, dammit.
my second car was a 01'  MK4 GTI VR6 5 spd manual...  I have dreams I'm driving that car to this day.. if you were in the VW scene as a youngster you were a lucky guy... you could see the future of the car scene before it happened..
“Community”  🎶Give me some more. Time in a dream. Give me the hope, to run out of steam🎶
Was it a 1.8 GL? I had a GL as my 2nd car after I was nearly killed by an Austin Metro’s steering wheel. I lowered it, put OZ Polaris alloys on, put VR6 chin spoiler on it, debadged the back, put a roof aerial on, put an Alpine system in it. I loved it. I used to drool over Performance VW mag.
I have a golf GTI but it’s a 2019. Is that old enough to still be friends James?
Stop cuz i have a golf already
I have a very good jetta 3 am building
Just yesterday, my son (17) bought a 2009 Rabbit 2.5 2dr manual for $500. And so it begins again
James: “I’m here to convince you the Golf is the best bang for your buck” Also James: “I might have to throw it away and buy another”
Good thing I've been a VW person. I had a mk4 anniversary edition. A mk7.5 and mk7 Jetta
We need more videos on the Golf
Cute colors
I have never been a VW van, but I can’t wait to see what you do with that car
Good thing I already got my MK2 Golf Project finished
Giorgetto Giugiaro designed mark one Golf.The man is a legend🤌🇮🇹
It was a small bit, but thank you for pointing out these cars are probably dangerous and may not be great for inexperienced drivers. Safety rules tend to be written in blood
The main man back in action, love from the UK, can't wait to see some action 😂💓
Can we stop making the 2.5 cool the prices are going up
I needa strip literally everything off my mk4 gti because the rust belt hates golf platforms 😂
My first car was a 97 gti with VR6. Been a vw head ever since 🔥 i still got some dash components and other randoms if you need
I've stopped watching Donut a loooong ass time ago. Now to watch James get back to working on his car and what feels like a more down to earth build, I'm glad to be back to watching content like this. Plus, to work on older modern vehicles brings back the nostalgic vibes.
Excited to see where this goes.
"and my goal by the end of this video is too increase the price of Golfs, so you can't actually buy one" FTFY 🤣🤣
I got a golf Mk1 1992. The amount of thing's I add on my car is just speechless. Me and my dad turbocharged it during lockdown and 5 years later it's still pulling strong. Motor I have in the car is a 2 liter 8 valve. Ngl these old motor's are strong.
Don’t kill me… my tall ass bought a Jetta instead
poop
The mk2 is my favorite
Looking forward to this! Have you ever considered going to Alpine Vag Fair in Helen, GA? It’s got the SoWo/H2o vibe. Bring this car when it’s done. Great opportunity, too!
here we goooo, bois. HEEERRRE WE GO. \m/ >.< \m/
James, when will we see you at the Euro Rally /VW weekend in Eureka Springs AR?
what are the odds, just bought a mk4 golf last friday
absolutely love to see it dude! i wish i was on the left coast id clean that fender up for you!  #vortexforver     (eh fenders look rusty, easy swap)
Heck yeah - might just have to pick up a golf. This channel is, by far, the best channel on YouTube.
I love this car. I am excited to see what you do with it.
Dont get a newer Golf, money pit, burns oil and needlessly complex for a 4 cylinder
got a mk6 shes went boom once but shes driving again lmao they're dope grenades ill be honest
Noooooo.. I JUST SOLD MY TDI I DONT NEED ANOTHER GOLF PROJECT
Great job!
My Dad had a Mk4 GTI that was supposed to be passed down to me.....however some asshat crashed into it  😢
FINALLY!! Real car content not just information about car stuff
Fix list: - The car. 😜
I’m a dyed in the wool mk1 guy, but I gotta admit this is gonna be a real good time
I feel like this with the early 3 series BMWs. My first car at 16 was a E36 and in college a E46. Both were fun, reliable, and easy to work on. Best cars I’ve owned. Im saving for a e30 now
We need a speed app which is almost like van wiki except it's just a Volkswagen forum
A 90s Volkswagen content finally! Let's GO!
You’re reminding me about my rocker panels on my 04 CVPI, rust is awesome 😄
Respectfully, there is zero chance that I will buy a Volkswagen unless it's a Porsche. But I'm willing to let you try and convince me anyway 😂
Cmon man! This car is junk. Get a another mk3 that is rust free. Plenty available in the Southwest. Just avoid rustbelt, Gulf and East Coast cars.
Making VW nerds around the world proud ❤
Time for a 3.2l VR6 swap😅😅😅
Can’t wait for this series! I’d love to see any of the VWVortex old guard (Scotto especially!) come over to reminisce and have a beer while ya wrench
i have VW Cabrio 3.5 with a 2.8VR6 Its wayyyy to funn to drive!!
James still rocking that donut mic in all his videos 🤣
He’s so loyal to Volkswagen golf’s it’s kinda amazing 😂
the only thing that the mid engine golf from jpperformance and your golf have in common is the color his car is actually a tube frame with r8 drivetrain and widebody golf look
I just recently bought a 04 Jetta GL it’s really nothing special but it does not run and this hopefully the beginning of my learning journey on fixing cars I’m excited
Audi A4's are the Audi Equivelent to the golf and shares like 60-70% of the parts! its totally worth looking at a4's of you cant find the golf you want!
I love the Golf but i hate it slammed 💔
I would be lying if i said James wasnt partially responsible for me buying a MK7 GTI a couple years ago.
Dig the car but I can't fit inside them unless I remove the front seat and sit in the back. Too bad they don't have pop up up and down headlights.
as a mk5 gti owner, this was and still is my first and only car. I've been driving it for almost 3.5 years. I would say just get the rabbit. the I5 is easier to maintain, no turbo problems. cheaper with problems. and that NA power is really fun when driving my friends rabbit. Like yes turbo fun and all, but mine is really starting to go down since im pushing 195k miles and the 4th owner. plus if you put the money into a turbo kit that I5 dominates any mk5-6 Gti.
You were always better off with a better chassis
Ive been on the 07k wave for a MINUTE but can finally afford to do silly things like swap the E30 or Mk2. Thanks James :)
1:09 that dent is nothing compared to the Subaru you totaled out at the track with Donut 👀
My dad has always been a Volkswagen guy (his preference is the MK2-3 Corrado) and so I am a Volkswagen guy but Im still young and havent had the money to buy one but if I ever got my hands on a MK2 Golf, I can guarantee itd be the blackhole for all of my money
Why back from Donut? Did donut buy it from him at some point?
Going to the shop in a G Wagon lol
Yeah, my first car was a mk5 gts (i'm not that old yet thou). I really loved it 😅 Now i'm daily driving a manual mk7 gtd since like 2012. Never had any major issues 👍
No shade, but it always sounds like Americans say "VolTswagen" instead of "VolKswagen"
this content is insanely good. James, your are getting people attention for a good cause. you are creating a mentaly healthy community. you reduce stress and pressure on peoples back by helping them socialise with dicord. Reading books is insanely good! Try everithing is fu@@ed of mark menson next. It helps a lot.    The fact that you are doing so well after donut just give me hope. it give hope to people. It give hope that change can bring so much hapiness in their life and it stimulate crativity.   Your certainly think outside of the box. I take off my hat to you. respect.   please continue to be mt entertainement during my lunch time!
Got my first car two years ago, a 1977 mk1 golf, lofoten green, I love it to death and currently saving money for a air suspension setup, so glad that u restarted this golf! Incredible color, incredible engine, incredible story!
Mk3. Now that's a cool Golf!
DUDE!!!  You can't show a screencap of Dom without saying "family!!!"
I had a 1997 VR6 mk3 5 speed. Absolutely bulletproof drivetrain. Beat the crap out of it. Had 175 hp to the wheels n/a. Super fun to drive.
I live in the Northeast, where everything is way overpriced and rusted more than the titanic! The average person can’t afford a project car around here.
yay, the Golf is back! though what's with the scirocco you once had years ago
Honda did it first
Still have my Mars Red 2 door '84 GLI...on blocks ugh
Big Time Speeed 👀💪🏽
AWW YEAH MO POWAH BABY I can't wait James.
Ever since i was 9yo I dreamt about my first car being a Golf 3 GTI. And 3 years ago, i made that dream come true. I bought my first car at 17yo for 700€. Unfortunately i cannot drive it in winter, because it would rot to rust. But it was the best purchase i've done. Right now im restoring it and fixing everything i can on it.
Did americans had old passats(B3/B2)? They are huge in eastern europe
I LOVE this video! Thank you James
I sold my 04 VW R32 almost a year ago now, I got it in 07, thought I was ok with the decision and had moved on from that chapter in life until watching this. Damn you James for bringing back all the feels, you got to me on the deepest level a car enthusiast can have. Can’t wait to see your project in print, if we ever meet in person, I want your signature on the cover.
Never...never again will i buy the rolling garbage can that is a vw. Waited all my life for a wolfsburg GTI fresh off the line and i got it..and for the next 5 years i had my car in the shop more often than every car i had owned and every car since. It was A 100% p.o.s. at one point rolling my windows up and down changed the volume on my stereo. And when i say a pos it wasnt just engine and clutch issues from week one it was everything. It was in the shop just to get the windows to go up and down 5 times first 2 years. VW is a scam company thats why they are slowly dying. and i went directly back to a car brand that isnt popular cause of tuner hype and nostalgia..toyota
will you still accept me in the discord and as a friend with my hatch back e36?
yes finally  vw build !!! i have a 2001 jetta vr6 wagon myself i love it
Where’s Nolan at doggie
Oh boy
In Poland when i was in high school most of douchebags owned MK3 Golf, but I can't wait for next episode of this project.
I love TBS. AND i was at H20i in Ocean city, MD a few times!
Hahahaha I got my cousins golf in my garage on stands. 2025 I guess is the year of its restoration.
Watching this video in picture-in-picture whilst searching eBay for a base spec mk3 golf.   I just really want to buy a base spec
my GF had a 2.5L 5cyl jetta and i've wanted to put that engine in something ever since.
Aaahhh shit...i had a 1992 240sx in high-school  1997
i dont know man... im 1 minute in. i've convinced people to never buy VW's if they cant maintain them. everyone i knew who had one always had issues but they where also people to run it till it breaks, cob it back and run it till something else breaks... but ima watch and see
James. It's okay my dude. The car scene 1,000% NEEDS to go back to the way it used to be.
Engine blowing smoke from every orifice and still idling just fine its a clear "I still have potential, please fix me!".
Speeed VW meet lets go
Was amazing donut turned BS corporate donut holding it hostage and refusing to give YOU back YOUR car?  Also, man, Donut and Hoonigan both used to be the best car channels on YouTube,  until the owners sold out and became corporate (and that's including Scotto as selling out)
This is perfect as I’m turning 16 on Monday and I’m gonna buy our golf from my dad. Its super cool honestly and I’m pumped (btw it’s a tuned vr6 and it’s got the euro plate)
golf gti are cool, unfortunately, those are only driven by morons where i live (same for bmw, mercedes and audi).
*opinionated video*
I had mk3 golf wagon for 10 years with that 1.8 litre(ADZ) engine which I drove around untill it was time to buy something newer. Super reliable car for sure but good god it was awful to drive compared to a 2007 bmw 325d(e90) which I have currently and I recently bought a toyota chaser(jzx100) tourer-v but I haven't had the chance to drive it because of the winter.
One of the best channels on YouTube rn
James is a 2.5 beetle okay ?it’s a golf that went to Dr Miami
Just bought a 01 manual jetta wolfburg edition.Has issues but so hype as my 00 jetta is automatic and transmission is definitely going out. Also has almost 200k miles. New one only has 140k on it . Glad to see you got it back and are showing it love. Great video.
German smoke machine
Had the chance to buy a 20th Anniversary a couple weeks ago…bummed I didn’t send it.
Mine was on the PVW cover of July 2023, looking forward to seeing yours mate!
Here in Argentina VW is like a crazy culture, followed by BMW. There's a passion for these 2 brands and they take the cars to the extreme
Petition to make ‘mericans learn the pronunciation of ‘Volkswagen’ 😅
Big time collab give the people what they want sir
The golf at 0:14 is from Jp performance
She's home🥹
"Replicated" and showing JP´s G3 Project is actually disrespectful.
Americans are blessed with good filming weather year round.
Dont mind me. Just adding a comment for engagement.
My second car was a 95 VW Passat VR6 wolfsburg edition I loved that thing
This whole video! SAME!! SO SAME!  I still have my T3/T4 02' GTI. VWVORTEX REPRESENT! I LOVE YOU!!!  By the way, I LOVE your style bro. Crushing hard.
Huge fan James but civics did everything golf's did 10 years earlier and Americans did with muscle cars since the beginning of time the car seen has been doing wild wild custom stuff since the 1930s
Video's been up 32 minutes, golf prices have tripled
Honda fit has entered the chat
I learned how to drive stick on my mk7.5 GTI. Love that car so much
I went to h20 for 5 years from 08-12 and even the last year was starting to get out of hand with crashes and impounds.
My first car was a ‘00 mark 3 Golf with a 5 speed and it was honestly a great car.
Not wrong , but i just bought my second 97 Integra
Calling 0:14 a replica is diabolical
my fav car working there
Has anyone done a golf k20 swap
Holy shit James! You look totally different good for you man !
I am so on board to see you back in a garage man, love you~
I have two Mk4 jetta I have the saden with a 1.8t and a wagon with the 12v vr6 I'll send you some photos james
As a Volvo guy, I support this (re)build
As a MK4 GTI 1.8t owner I agree with this message, just don’t neglect them and they’ll live a long life
not gonna get a golf but thanks for the video
late
That feeling of trawling vwvortex in the early 2000's and having an account, but never having owned a vw
That “might as well” line is a slippery slope my friend. I’m pretty sure your wallet was relieved that your engine started up. Looking forward to seeing what this Golf will become.
a mercades w124 e500 would be so cool bro
Excited for this build series :)
So stoked to follow this. Happy she lives on for you (and us), James!
18:33 that’s exactly how the rockers and jacking points on mine were, and all along the sides of the  floor pans by the pinch welds were  gone, so I bought floor boards and rockers and cut and fit them, and re enforced the jacking points with thicker metal with custom fabrication
Man, you should come to Brasil. Basically, VW started the gearhead culture over here. The Golf was one of the cars that made history here, but his younger and poor cousin, the Gol (without the F), its the star. We even got the GT, GTS and GTI versions. Google it and you gonna love it! 🇧🇷
Who is a bald red guy?
No one in my area had Volkswagens.  It was all Honda Civics and the occasional Accord, Acura Legend, or American muscle car, and me and my Subaru.
Dude, I teared up in the first few minutes here. We're roughly the same age, and my first car in 1998 was a mk3 Golf, 2nd was a G60 Corrado, 3rd was a mk4 1.8T GTI. I did Waterfest (ever see a mk4 1.8T run 11's? I was the first @ Waterfest in .... 2003 maybe?), H2Oi (Was there when the doofus from Texas with the RS3 wrapped it around the pole after sliding through the culvert at the entrance). I knew/was friends with Jamie Orr (still do and live about a mile from him!). Seeing the video, hearing your stories reminds me so much of my own early adulthood and how much I miss those feelings of comradery. Some of my best friends today were made on Vortex or at those shows, even though we all kind of outgrew the scene. Except I'd argue that the scene changed more so than we outgrew it. We liked what we liked and what was 'cool' evolved and changed, as it always does. Like Abe Simpson said, "I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me, and it'll happen to you, too!" I still love my mk2/3/4 cars.  Anyways, great video. Love the content. Keep it up.  EDIT: I also went to the South Florida GTG with Mike Ngo in maybe... 2004 or 2005? Tell him 'Holla fo a dolla!' and see if he remembers that.
i would never buy a vw
Just bought a mk4 project for 400 bucks and this drops lmao
Glof
What you feel for Golf GTIs, is what I feel for Grand Prix GTPs
I love you James
why americans say liters in motors and not gallons? in my country we say 1.0 ,1.6 says more about the motor than liters , or im wrong?
You're so right James, keep making videos about the car you love, regardless if it bumps the price or not! It does so much for the culture and people can stay mad. Also nothing to do with anything but please don't make a video about the Subaru Impreza GC8.
What part of Ky did you grow up in?
I have 2.5 settings out it ran when it pulled you can have it's in Lake county Ca. Its free
Can we get a poster of James at the sketchy wifi coffee shop? 😅😂
You gonna have a lot of Honda fanboys in your comments about how the civic is a better bang for your buck project car😂
Hit the nail on the head with "project" car 😅😂
James please come out it'd be good for the community
Vws are crap
sick speeed! looking forward to this build
You take care of that precious precious baby. 💙
I need some advice pls my 2000 golf tdi alh has blow by and I don’t know what to do I love the car I’ve put a lot of money in it and I’m pretty good at working on cars but I don’t know I feel about replacing rings and I don’t have the money to pay someone to do it what should I do try to sale it and get what I can for it or drive it until the rings give out and try to replace them
I was gonna get a golf but then I watched humble mechanic.  No thank you.
Before you click too many weird links trying to find a cheap Golf, go to https://nordvpn.com/speeed and protect yourself!
Damn Golf R is faster to 60mph than my '14 SS Camaro.  I find that hilarious and ironic.
We are all actually VW guys we just don't know it. If you think you have an audi you actually might be driving a VW, if you think you have a porsche, you might just be driving a VW, lamborghini, Ducati, Bentley, you are actually just an undercover sleeper VW fanboy.
Dawg, calling JP's Golf 4 a rep of yours is bs... It you knew anything about this car you'dve never said that.. sick car tho still!!!!
This gives me hope for rebuilding my first car. It's got rust, and it was t-boned, but I've got a huge sentimental attachment to it. But it should be repairable and this video gives me the motivation to start back to it
I want to hear about your car, but I'm 30 seconds in and I need to know where you got your boots. Don't let me down, james.
Im a mk3 Golf GTI owner, and a huge fan of yours, so this is like MY DREAM series!
I love VW Vortex. they still send me birthday emails through their automated system lol
Love my Passat, Jetta Wagen TDI, and my MK2 GTI. Count me in ill be watching everyone of these vids✨🚙✨ Cant wait to see this Mk3 come back to life
VW nerds are the best.
hooray!
I’ve missed builds like this ❤️
Missed a trick - next time have Big Time carry your project car in their project truck
Seeing James smile at the end, knowing he’s gonna be able to rebuild his dream car warms my heart. You love to see it.
Hell yeah!! Car content
I adore my mk7 golf. I couldn’t have asked for a better first car to be honest. Jap import so mileage was low.  Recommend it to anyone.
10:02 Hi, I'm James. Do you want to be friends?
Dude I’ve had 2 mk5s because of nostalgia and they’re just great and fun cars. I’m on my 3rd one right now! Just bought it 2 weeks ago haha got a white 07 GLI! VW boys let’s get it!!
I’ve always loved Golfs and I always wanted one I still do
the kids found drifting and this FWD commuter car crap died.
SIIIIIIIICK
What happen to your bmw ?
🔥
I already have a Golf project. 😛I've owned VWs for almost 25 years. I would LOVE if people got back onto car forums. When you get the car done, you should drive it up to Pacific Waterland in Oregon!   You should talk to Justin from Linder Power Systems about getting some sweet 07k parts.
I hope to get my MK3 back on the road this year. 🍻 to the finish line.
lets gooooo!
i had mk3 golf in 2016 bough it for very low price as object to learn mechanics for my friend (now mechanic in ford dealership) and me to practice my negotation skills (now working on my master degree in economy+ menagment) so mk3 helped us start our carrers good cars
Projectoh-Seat-Oh Kuhh!
Love the optimism and good vibes over a smoking engine bay 😂
Thank God cars are back. Was expecting a video on Versace lol😊
The VW community has completely changed my life, it’s given me my current job, and I’ve made lifelong friends because of it, it’s the best!
Everyone clutching hoping they turn it off soon.
I'll sell you a 1991 Volkswagen Corrado! Great 1.8 engine and supercharger in it.
Can my mk4 be friends with your mk3?
Got MK8 GTI as my first car and I am so so so so in love with it. Will probs get an old golf in few years for a project car
18:52 was that a Hoovies garage reference? the face he makes every time he's doing this with the carwiz
Make me want to start up my project car .  I never finish my vw scirocco project .
fyeah!!!
I’ve had r32’s and gtis my entire life on in my 4th mk5r32 now I always have a vdub and a fun project weekend car they are the best better be a good wrench tho.
Man I fucking love you man  *edit* James can you help me finish my mk1 Cabrio project pls ❤️
Learned how to drive on my dad's Mk3 Golf Tdi.. torquie little thing that had 250k miles
Shout out from Brazil! We've got a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE VW community here!
Loving everything about this. That scene def influenced the youtube channels i follow today.  Good ol days.
First off: JAMES DOING CAR STUFF AGAIN RAHHH  Second: God damn it James I can’t afford a project car right now because we are trying to save up to buy a house (challenge level impossible). You’re gonna double the price of used golf’s with this!
I've had 3 Golfs, 1 MK3 and 2 MK4(my last one was a MK4 GTI VR6) and I will say they can definitely be a blast to drive with even just a few minor power upgrades. I do also think they are fairly good looking cars. A decent design that will forever be classic IMO.
Haven’t even watched the video and already know it’s gonna be a doozy. I’m pumped.
Idk why but I’m hearing him say ‘voltswagen’
The 07K is SO SLEPT ON! In stock form it’s sooooooo reliable. Oil is optional 😂( not really ) but the best mix between Volkswagen feel and Toyota reliability.
The last brand new car I bought was a 2000 VW Golf. Black. I drove it for 14 years, my Mom drove it another 8 years, my sister another 2 years. Then we let it go to another family. I forget the milage, but I rode tripped that car a lot!
I'm currently working on my MKV. Hopefully can hang with others when I'm done.
6:14 nah, not allowed in ireland as a first car
what about the miata?
We can't hang oùt. You live there. I live here. 😢
i want a golf tdi
The answer is always Miata ;)
best vw golf in the world
sickkkkkkkkkkk
Can my old ford pickup be considered a vw too even though it has a v8
Thats not rust, thats just... SPEED HOLES
Love the headlights soo much.
Maaaaaan, what a dilemma. I wasn’t planning on buying a VW at all… but I think it would be awesome to be friends with James.
omw to buy a golf after 30 seconds of watching the video
No vw is cheap. Parts are bro-taxed to hell.
I've done 5 and working on a 6th.
0:51 - Am listening This brings back a memory of a MK3 Golf that I saw when I started working as a paperboy (just revealed that I am old) in my neighbor.
It's time to think about audi 200 c2. Absolutely a sick car.
I put 250 thousand miles on my mk4 base model jetta. Thing was bullet proof. You can literally buy a car now for $750 that will get you over 100,000 miles add a budget of maybe $1k a year in repairs, thats very very cheap mileage.
Yo he is driving a G-wagon i think
James listens to TBS? He's like me fr
HELL YEAH!!!
Jesus, car culture is due for a revive. We need to go back to buying the car people forgot about, building it and turning it into our own unique piece of machinery that we call our own. When slews of people start to do that, we will get back to it.
I think my next will be a Golf. 5 swap, lift kit, skid plate, off-road grips and a kayak rack is my style.
Mk2 was best looking of all golfs.  That said... I have a VR Corrado.
Speaking of cheap good engine swaps, gotta mention the Vortec 4200. Bone stock you can slap an ebay turbo on and make 500+hp
I grew up around v8s and American cars but I want to build something non American with a small engine to toy around in! A golf world be awesome but I also really like the 80s 2 door bmws my dad one with a body kit and it was so cool looking and it’s how I learned to drive a standard, I haven’t seen one like it since we sold it, the guy that bought it never registered it and got it towed. My dad got a call one day saying they have his car so we went to see it and it was just rust! 😢 but I have always wanted one after that.
Man I miss my mk4 vr6
James was by far the best part of Donut. Donut has no heart anymore. It's hard to watch.
MK3 prices after this video 📈📈📈
I love golfs, I just don't want to deal with Volkswagen issues 😂. My friend that had one ended up blowing every seal on the motor and had to rebuild it just for it to have more issues. And it was stock.
Uncle James is back.
Does my 1.8t 240 count as a vw
Yep! I am 46 and in 2008 I remember how big vw scene was. Vortec was probably one of the best forums. Vw and volvos are probably the best bang for your buck cars to mod.
I had an 03 GLI in high school that I had to get rid of. That is my biggest regret in life.
I love it!  I started w/ air-cooled VWs then drove a Mk2 GTI and was hooked.  Mk3 GTI, 3 MK4 GTIs, MK6 GTI and Mk7 GTI followed.  Now I'm back to air-cooled.  Always looking at Mk4 R32s.  Love these cars!  Great video!
"bald red guy" ? whos he referring to? 😂
What cars you have right now 2:09
8:24 🇹🇷 Turkiye mentioned yesssssss
I bought a new black Mk2 GTI 16V when I got hired by Microsoft in 1989.  It was my dream car.  And I drove it until it fell apart, not because I drove it a million miles but more because I did a shit job of maintaining it.  I'm sorry, car.  I've learned to do better.
I love that you started a book club.
Pretty sure I commented this before but  I’m doing  it again.  James, your mk3 inspired me to restore my dad’s 1997 mk3 vr6. Now it’s mine! New floor pans, yes 0 rust, custom interior etc.  all cause of this golf
Hell yeah dude
More of this!
Commuinity
😧 I have a mk4 2.0 🐢 love this 🔥
7:03 What other company? ..... peugeot  and renault for sure. Possibly fiat as well. Comments will tell 😂
DUDE!
Lets goooo!!!
Having James as your next door neighbor would be sick af.
The integra used to be the best bang for your buck fwd sports compact back when they were cheap. I wholeheartedly agree that the golf is next
No it’s a Honda civic
First time I saw Jp performance G3 project, I was like isn't that james car?
YES YES YES. MK3 golf has always been my favourite car. Iv had 11 of them. The best golf in my opinion.
As a European it's so cute that ancient Golfs have replaced fixed gear bicycles for the American hipster as the source of some elusive, quirky cool, while at the same time being objectively as attention worthy as those disgusting retro running shoes the same kind of people wear nowadays
That inline 5 is also the sexiest sounding engine.
You son of a b I’m in. 0:52
dude the 2.5 community on fb is the most toxic group ive ever been apart of
Lets go James!!!!
Oh my god yes, so awesome to see the VW back and get the love it deserves. Super stoked to watch this.
2:12 Prop to y photo of Frank jetta from Unix performance in PVW :D 2:13 Remi Corrado too
Lets go!
So an up to speed on James pumphrey's golf
Only minor issues
God damnit James, I’m trying to get a GTI and here you are raising the price 😢
The magazine that CARS WERE NAMED AFTER 😂
🎉🎉🎉 85 GTI was my first. 89 SI hatch is the current project. Love VW, but Honda and the K series stole my heart. 😮
lowkeyyy need a video on that g wagon ur driving lmao
James!!! You gotta hit up Jermiah and Zach to collaborate on this one. Perhaps a few videos on this channel and a few on their? So excited for this project! All the best!
Day 6 of asking for a video on Kimi Raikkonen.
Im so glad James and other youtubers are finally talking about 07Ks because they are awesome engines and they are just slept on.  Its even funnier that they are the ‘base model’ engine for the Golf and Jetta
james i love ur vids man
I do need a new money pit
You'd love the VW scene in South Africa, got so many guys driving around in mk1 Golfs and such
Makes me appreciate my Volkswagens more
Glad to know James is still going strong after his departure from Donut 🙏
@6:42 THE* Pumphrey, The
Oh man, hadn't thought about VW Vortex in ages.
I got a mk7 r
My first car was a mk2 and i loved it. Rust was an Issue on the mk3 here in germany. I thought SoCal is better 😂 we had a mk3 vento/jetta. That was just crumbeling apart...
Volkswagens are an addiction.
We NEED a Big Time x Speeed collab
Best bang for your buck??? ????? Bro.... I love you but..... AAAAHAHAHAHAH no. 😬 This is going to be 20-40k all in. I get it that its your first love but be real. <3
100 likes per minute!  Nice Job!
God I miss h20 and vortex. Those days were so great.
Only owned one VW and I think it’s been my favorite car I’ve had the chance to own. $1500 04 phaeton that had a burble and 2 step tune and massaging seats is hard to beat
Hyped to see more of your VW content!
Mk5 Rabbit Gang gang 🤙🏾
And just like that, golf’s become overpriced
5:19 Joe Dirt voice… Dang😎
Damn, I'm here early. But I'm here for it.
Was wondering what happened to this car
Can't wait your E30 back in your channel
I absolutely love my MK7 GTI : ) Its a great budget tuner DD, growing up on the eastern shore of Maryland H2Oi was an annual pilgrimage in Highschool and the 2-3 years after.. Good times.. Now they banned it because It just turned into a takeover of OC lmao people ruin everything good..
Oh baby my golf's going up in value again like the RX-7 don't tell anyone the first gen is really a horrible driving car compared to a 240! I drive lots of cars but honestly the Mark 3 Golf driving Dynamics (trailing arm rear steer replaced or new) are the most fun from zero to a speed for the highway you can really have on a road that's not just straightline speed. This 5 cylinder Audi swap is a little much for me, I'd vr5 swap mine if I could.
Toyota is better
“The” Hot Hatch
LETSGOOOO
We miss up to speed but at least we still get to see Mr JAMES
Shit I still look up info on vw vortex 😂
Nooo I don’t need vw prices to go up
About time you got it back. So happy for you man! I may not have a Golf, but I have my Fiance's old 2003 Honda accord as my project car. Been working on it for a year now. Eventually want it to look like it rolled off the profuction line.
Spend enough on that stool J?
A car project is never finished.
carried Donut fr
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why did they still had your car? (:
Dude how could donut let all that happen to YOUR car. Surely they have to give you some kind of compensation for that?
looking forward to the golf build.
donuts sucks I left one they had some guy running the channel he is not interesting at all
Algorithm!
Ho. Lee. Shit.
WE'RE BACK
R.I.P. to the mk3 market 😢
Man i miss vw vortex
Sweet bro 👊
Oh my
I have an 03 jetta project lol
Dang, I already have 3 projects to finish now I gotta add a MK3. Challenge excepted
Target demo

14:00 the "might as well" theory you got sounds a lot like a car guys mindset  "oh if I'm getting better tires I *might as well* put an engine that has 800 hp in it"😂
