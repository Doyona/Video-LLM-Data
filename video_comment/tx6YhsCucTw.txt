Anyone supporting this party needs serious help. Or education. Or common sense.
Just selling dream as usual, nothing concrete or realist, I won't vote for it for sure.
I love EFF since day one  and I will continue vote for EFF 🇿🇦🌟🔥🏅I vote for  change  I hate ANC since Mandela became a president of this country from  Mandela up to Ramaphosa   I honor the real heroes of the ANC such Chris Hani, Steve Biko, King Hintsa etc 🌟those heroes they died for us to get our freedom back But yet we still living under Apartheid government of Ramaphosa  30 years in Eastern cape villages people are still walking miles to fetch dirty water on the river in winter river become dry because of drought they're drinking water with animals  and you call that democracy? I'm talking about unemployment, loadshedding, corruption, crime, poor infrastructure, poor education ,poor health care facilities etc I'm just talking about water, water is life
The EFF has demonstrated remarkable leadership, accountability, and determination. If we were to wake up tomorrow with the EFF governing our country, it would undoubtedly become a better nation. Anyone who chooses not to vote for the EFF is denying the country responsible governance.
