Mr Ambassador., Haiti is not a state of america.  Please  let haitian  decide for haiti, you are the on who choose  our leader. Let us breathe  we are suffocating
Haiti or some country in Africa, all look the same.

𝗜𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗱𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀?  Imagine three people working together, lifting heavy rocks. One is tired and says, "It's hard work." The second one says, "I'm doing it for money." The third one proudly says, "I'm building a temple."  Building a temple seems easier because it gives a bigger purpose. This is the key to finding happiness in any situation, including difficult ones. We can always dream of bigger and better things if we think of a higher goal, and we would thus be wise to always try to do something important, as it gives us a reason to work.  Setting goals thus helps us find happiness, even in tough times. If our goal is like building a temple, the hard work feels lighter. Also, if we aim at a great goal in life, we can inspire others to also set a great goal for themselves, leading with a positive example. Simply put, having meaningful goals and inspiring examples can change how we all work toward happier lives.
Mr Eric stromayer bring your prime minister ariel Henry to Washington in the white house . In your country u follow rule and in haiti u want to decide for us. Where u get this authority. You doesn't want our citizens travel to Kenya because of cholera and you want to send Kenya in haiti to give cholera and VIH. USA friends act differently. Get out in haiti. Thank you for all gangs.
Frèm non pam Ruth Jardimène  ede m priye

ERIC STROMAYER MUST GO FROM HAITI   ERIC STROMAYER  PERSONA NUN  GRATA  arielhenry andre michel  MUST GO FROM HAITI IN PERSONA NUN GRATA  ALL AMBASSADOR  MUST GO GO FROM HAITI 🇭🇹
Also we need the resignation of Core Group within our country, because it is the major problem that prevents us from living in peace. The international community should stop telling us what we should  or should not do. And the decision they take for us is so that they can see our end. Shame on them. Haiti will rise and shine!  No one, I mean no one will be able to prevent this prophecy from being fulfilled!  We are the real people of the Book (bible) son's of Jacob. We will come back to The Most High. When those days come, no one will be able to stand before us, for the destructive arm of the Almighty will be our strength!
Alaso sa ki mouri zafe yo 😭😭😭😭😭
This fellow haitian People has been suffering so long, yes! So much is too much! Too much hypocrasy.

Yo tout kon'nen sa kap pase ayiti a  yo tout okouran se yo kap fèl wi Salomon
We are demanding that he leaves because of his association with so many criminal activities. He has and continues to support and arming the most dangerous gangsters to harm Haitians forcing them to leave their homes. @Reuters @newyorktimes @dailynews @haitiantimes.@ApPress. The  man is dangerous and posing a major threat to his own country. He has been using the Police to protect himself not the people by violating the people human rights. Ariel Henry has blood all over his hands. The only governmental entity standing by the people is BSAP. If the US continues to support this man, it will cost @Joebiden the election. We, the Haitian Americans want the US to stop supporting and protecting this criminal who needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law in Haiti. Haiti should be left to make their own decision in terms of what is best for their citizens, as a sovereign nation. Haiti’s stability is important to American immigration solutions. This will save the US a lot of headaches and spread democracy in the region.
ABA AMERIKEN ABA ARIEL VIVE GUY PHILIP VIVE BSAB ABA LA POLICE GANG ARIEL YO.NAP MANDEJUSTICE POU BSAB YO JUSTICE POU JOUNALISE LA ARIELFE PETE ZIEL AK GAZ.JUSTICEVIVE AITI❤🙏♻️😟🙏♻️🎉♻️❤️🤤💔

The US government has its fingers deep in what is happening in Haiti, to steal what we have from the earth, we ask Biden to come and get his fellow murderer, to give him a place in the white house, to come and find his fellow dead dog ah, we are tired, it is a bath of blood that Biden wants to reach Haiti, criminal gang.
is to take our son, because the people can no longer.
It’s terrible what’s going on in my country I want Ariel Henry to leave so I can go visit 🇭🇹

According to Haitians on the Ground Ariel Henry is assassinating peaceful protesters on the street. Where is the international human rights council??? Where’s The U.N…. Where are Haiti’s friends??? 🔥🇭🇹
Ariel need to go viv Haiti 🇭🇹 viv revolution
Ariel,Elbe sipoze al penitansyè Nan komplo ki touyè 7 BSAP an a bal UTG UDMO crimenel,assasin nanKomplo Ameriken aba Ariel vv revolysion vv Guy Phillipe
Ariel  Henry must go
ILLEGAL ARIEL  IS A VIOLATION OF THE HAITIAN CONSTITUTION. WHAT KIND OF BS DEMOCRACY IS THAT?  THE ENTIRE/ WHOLE COUNTRY IS PROTESTING AGAINST AN ILLEGALLY ELECTED / SO CALLED PM.  DUMPING ILLEGALGUNS TO A COUNTRY WITH NO FACTORIES WHATSOEVER IS A SHAME AND A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.
Core Group and BIHNU need to leave with Ariel.they are the one supporting Ariel Henry…These organizations are similar to France in Mali 🇲🇱..terrorizing the people.
I don’t understand how come Ariel Henry and Andre Michel are not Americans and the US Ambassador Representative uses our taxpayer money to shelter them inside the US Embassy. That is not right.
Hey ambassad amerikin nou kache Ariel Henry al Andrew Michelle
The Police is always on the peoples side.
Well I guess is not Abinader's fault anymore, or the almighty Canal...
