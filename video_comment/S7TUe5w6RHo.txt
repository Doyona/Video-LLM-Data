Make a video about your book IMMUNE the book itself is awesome i love it :)
can we talk about the fact that the cambrian only appeared 53 minutes into the video
cool video❤
. 55:51
55:48 push it back
We loved this video! 😃🐦
Now we need the History of the other planets/the solar system, the Galaxy (the Milky Way), and then the history of The Universe.
You should make a poster of earths history. I would buy it
24:19 yes
I appreciate the clarity of this video.
So well explained, thank you.
Congrats on the camera man, I couldn’t have made it 100 years!
Demasiado genial!!! Y pensar que somos la reserva genética de todos los sobrevivientes  desde que apareció la vida. En nosotros hay millones de años de vida en la Tierra.
Nice to be back here again. 😁
Bored 8min waste intro😂
Really appreciate this upload.
2 ANNIVERSARY 🎉
This is without a doubt one of the most ambitious and breathtaking videos ever produced on YouTube. 🤯  Compressing 4.5 billion years of Earth's history into a one-hour 'train ride' is a stroke of genius that truly makes the concept of deep time manageable for the human brain. I was completely captivated, from the Hadean lava hell [01:32] to the moment humanity flashes by at the very end [01:00:39].  The animation is stunning, and the atmospheric music creates an incredibly immersive experience. This isn't just a video; it's a monumental achievement in educational content. The sheer amount of research and effort that went into this, as a project worked on since 2019 [01:00:51], is palpable.  You have created an absolute masterpiece, Kurzgesagt team. Channel Creator: Your dedication inspires millions! For anyone scrolling by, save this video right now. You are missing out on the best history lesson you will ever get. A must-watch!  Amazing work! ✨👏🚀🌍
7:10 at this point, most of the stars in the background started to use up all their fuel and began to die one by one.
44:55 and sex is invented .....
24:19 2763 :o
1:00:40 oogey boogey
This was just amazing guys. You are the best, I really appreciate they effort in building this video. 🎉
Wow! It’s amazing!
This clarified a lot for me.
Would love to see 1 hour video of last 1 million year. Basically the history of homo sapiens
Always great content from you.
One of the most helpful videos I’ve seen.
This might just be the best video on YouTube. Every so often I come back to it. Just so relaxing and soothing. Really makes you feel how insignificant any of our day to day problems are compared to the history of our planet.
Very high quality explanation.
Y’all forgot about the great dying and the Siberian traps
Had this on in the background. Who knew it took me over 1 billion years to drive to class?
short and easy to understand
1:00:41: I BLINKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I got exactly what I needed here.
So well thought out.
The explanation was excellent.
Okay I just started this and I am probly a lil bit late to the party but: Does anyone else just thougth one min in that they migth from now on go sleep watching this... it like... it gives off the calming bed time story vibes so much... I will probly eep like a baby kitten watching this.
Very well executed video.
nice
You should do one for mars, we know that mars like the history of mars.
Yes this is exactly the type of video I wanted thank you so much ❤
Every second in kurzgesagt's video, 1.5 million years pass.
that mesoarchean djent hits like tides from nebula
The fact that Columbia the supercontinent lasted for 600 million years, It was the continent that lasted the longest.     1:12 The Hadean Eon was the first eon of earth, all of earth was scorching. But it wont stay like this. Water could have been existing here. In this eon, earth is bombarded by tons of meteorites. With oceans of lava, Life is inhospitable in earth. It will cool down over time. Earth in the Hadean  Eon was spinning once every around 4 hours. Because of this, Earth was flattened a bit. The moon could also have been 60,000km away.  2:29 Earth cools down. But still, it is deadly    4:07 Earth was said to have oceans in 4300 million years ago, yet it has no life, Its first ocean was the Hadean Ocean. But lets just follow the timeline.    8:04 The Eoarchean begins, earth is 90 degrees °C and water starts. Earth is covered in water as it cools down. 9:47 Earth gets visible lakes on it. Yet it will take alot of time for a global ocean. Tectonic plates start here as well. The moon is now 100,000 km (estimated) so tides are extreme.      12:46 Hydrothermal vents start the seeding of life. It is likely that life started here. The first tiny islands appear. Theres no oxygen here yet. 13:35 The Paleoarchean starts. Nothing really happens except the islands get bigger as volcanoes rise.    18:45  The Mesoarchean starts and also nothing really happens, except earth spins slower (now at 9.6 hrs) and cells multiply. They can learn to eat sunlight soon. Earths oceans are green because of the amount of iron in them. Iron was abundant in the oceans during this time. Until oxygen came.     24:25 The Neoarchean comes around. The major supercontinent, Kenorland forms, It is said to be pretty big. But nothing is on the land yet. 25:29 Kenorland breaks apart, with the first island that appeared merging with another. 27:11 Oxygen gets introduced around here, but this would change earth forever. And it will entirely. 27:49 The Siderian doesn’t really have to do with the Iron Banding and the Huronian Glaciation. But the iron banding is a massive event.   27:49 because pf the oxygen amount, it gets mixed with the iron in the ocean, creating iron oxide, which is why earth turned red. Your blood also has iron oxide too.   With the amount of ocean, the threshold of the iron oxide makes it nearly black Because a little makes it appear red, but with the mass of the earths oceans are green, it is a very deep red.   The Huronian glaciation begins, turning the earth into a snowball. 29:07     33:51 Earth returns as the deep red, yet iron oxide is still abundant. Atlantica is also assembled.   36:23 1850 million years ago, An asteroid hit into what is modern day Canada. It hit on a tiny island. But it ceased all iron banding on earth temporarily. After some 600 thousand years, the iron banding came back.   37:34 The Supercontinent Columbia forms, it is about the size of Pangea and will be drifting around for 600 million years. The boring billion starts, nothing really happens, but the neighbouring planet, Venus, gets hotter and is struggling to keep habitable.     Columbia 43:50  breaks apart in the middle of the Ectasian. It now is becoming a new supercontinent soon… What it is now is a continent appearing at both sides of the planet.      47:32  The Boring Billion ends, with life getting more fun and exciting.    Earth becomes now the only planet that is habitable now. 50:54 It is going to face a huge snowball event.  52:39 Life becomes better, with visible life appearing, which is the Phanerozoic.    The Cambrian starts. 53:54    54:51 Earth becomes greener. Pangea starts getting assembled around here.  56:23 The Carboniferous is a period where theres a lot of carbon. Thre isnt much to say but Pangea gets assembled.   57:22 The Great Dying appears, killing species on earth. Pangea is now here and dinosaurs appear.    57:43 Pangea starts breaking apart. Eurasia breaks apart from it.    58:17 The Jurassic is the most famous of all dinosaur ages. It is the golden age of Earth.   59:48 The KT Extinction happens, wiping out all dinosaurs. When it hit, nobody noticed until it rained molten glass and c02 filled the sky blocking out sunlight. It was hell, herbivoric dinosaurs was left with little to no food because it was a horrible winter. The herbivoric dinosaurs has no choice but to eat the dead bodies of other dinosaurs. Turning them to carnivores. After the dead bodies were gone, the herbivores died soon. But after that, earth recovered.   60:00 The Hour Mark. The rise of mammals appear.   1:00:33 Modern day animals are now recognisable now. Early humans start.  1:00:45 In this tiny period, was everything, Civilisations appeared, wars, and humans even built rockets to land on the moon and explore other planets. They illuminated the planet with lights, humans now rule the earth. Now, they have very good technology.    This took alot to write.
Your hard work really pays off.
i am, gonna put this as my wallpaper
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
goddamit so much shit has happened and I wont even get to see 1% of it :(
What extinct human was at the end it dident have a chin so it wasent a homo sapien but what kind of human is it can somebody help or know what that human at the end was
This clarified a lot for me.
This made the topic simple.
Jesus loves you
I love this video that im drawing it
For perspective the halfway point of earths history is around is Siderian-Rhyacian periods feels like it should be a younger period right? thats how long the Hadean and Archean really is.
16:52
The cameraman now has 4.6 billion TB of storage.
Can't wait for part 2!
Is it just me or the music in this goes hard! Great work. A masterpiece of animation as well.
Yeay i finish ✋🫩🤚 btw im surprised that cambrian era is at 53.35
that's not THE WHOLE TIMELINE, that is THE WHOLE 4.5 BYA to today INSIDE 4.5 BYA but make it 700000000000000000000000000000000000000x faster
This is really impressive.
I LOVVVE THIS. ❤
man, what if Kurzgesagt do a 10-hour video
It's actually 4.6
Looking for something boring to put me to sleep. Perfect!
It took me around 10 years to write this
Well at least I know I have the strength to waste 5 minutes of my life. GAY!!!
floor is lavaaaa
Brilliant !! Love the sound track as well
Perfectttttt.
4:00 peak
The delivery was great.
Somehow this is my favorite video of this channel.
Why does it feel so nostalgic in the cretaceous
Does anyone know what is the name of the track that play in the last quarter of the video? I can't find it in the "All of History" album by Epic Mountains, but I'm pretty sure I've heard this song before on Kurzgesagt. Maybe this is a remix?
Mesoarchean ROCKS!
1:44 “Almost none of it is left”, ALMOST, key word: ALMOST
I have a better question
am i tripping or do i hear hadean music in the mesoarchean? 22:13
59:47 fav year
When u said a billion years passed it was 2 billion years passed
the mesoarchean era sounds like the murder drones soundtrack, it’s so kewl :D
goes to show how short human life is as one second of fire storm and rainfall in this video is like thousands of generations of humans living and dying
nice!
How many Kilometers did the cameraman Travel Düring this Video.
This animation is soooo good, the subtle differences make perfect transitions, if I get distracted, everything is different. I'm only 14 mins in and in love
i know this was a year ago but i truly appreciate the animations and art in this video, especially with many youtubers turning towards Ai art.
Love this channel ❤❤❤
TICKETS TO THE EARTH HISTORY MOVIE!!
Thank you for animating this for us - although it could've been much more informative with more narration, it's immensely meditative this way and the music is also great! Kudos to you Kurzgesagt!
For a video with around 1500 words of information, this is an utter waste of an hour. Classic example of clickbait. My child could have read this entry in an encyclopedia and learnt far more!
Crazy how we have politicians telling us that we only have 35 years left before our world falls apart , yet the earth has been quietly forming just fine for the past cagillion years
This was explained really well.
I always said that if I was ever lucky enough to get a time machine, I'd go back to the start of the Earth and just hit fast forward on everything. I love that this sort of scratches that itch. I still hope I get to do the real thing one day lol but I'm grateful for the nerdy dedication behind this video. Well done and thank you
where did all of the water that makes up our oceans come from if the whole planet was made up of lava? i did a google search and it says meteors and asteroids filled with water but its like , bro what are you talking about.... where did that water come from? did that much water really come from meteors? it just dont make much sense to me, am i crazy?
kurzgesagt should do a 24/7 livestream of this but instead of 1.5 million years/second its something like 100k years/second to make it last long
45:05 Can you list some of those reasons? Asking for a friend...
Playing this while I'm mining for diamonds in Minecraft.
compressing 4.5 billion years into an hour is like watching creation breathe in fast motion. every minute holds an age, every second a spark of everything that ever was.
it's the worlds longest channel that you never reach the end
How do people know there was water on earth when covered in lava?.. did their parents tell them because they saw it with their own eyes 400+million years ago?.
Gonna be using this as the source for some part of my project report on Evolution 🫶😭
Very useful and well presented.
Dude this whole team is incredibly talented, this channel is great.
Thanks for sharing this content.
0:50 why is it so fast
한국 채널에도 올라왔으면 좋겠다
❤❤❤i love all your videos and NONE of them are bad so this? for free? thats AMAZING! i love what you do and keep doing it
Im13 and this is the thing I like to spend time on
Love it
If the earth was really hot and there was no bacteria, does that mean technically the entire planet was perfectly sterile for a few million years
The only creators that are putting emotion into earth’s history
4,500,000,000 ÷ 3,600 is 1.25 million years per second. He was 250,000 years off! Every second! But it was also only 17% off. That is the thing with big numbers.
Helpful content, thank you.
😐😑😶
I thought I would get bored watching this, but I couldn't be more wrong. The sense of awe I had during the entire thing... what an amazing experience that was! Thank you.
Amazing
god is the best
6 years in the making. This is a masterpiece!
54:13 It took that fish like 5 million years to swim. 😅
i fell asleep🥲 i was vibin with the music and it's so good!
i blinked:\
For the whole length of this video, I had Bill Wurtz's History of the Entire World, I Guess going through my mind.
God's world is truly insane, I thought the pre-cambrian was short, but in fact it's most of history, only the last 10 minutes are what we're mostly familiar with.
Thanks! +1 to what others said about gratitude for these videos.
Thanks for posting this.
55:48 59:43 1:00:43
Physical conditions (heat, atmosphere, radiation) are ignored.  The chemical stages of "life" (RNA, protein, lipid formation, etc.) are omitted.  And most importantly, the origin of life is told as a "story" but lacks a scientific basis.
Yes, the early Earth was largely covered with water, but the composition of this water was salty, acidic, and rich in minerals. It is biochemically impossible for life to have arisen directly from "rain-blown cells" in this environment. Evet, erken Dünya büyük oranda suyla kaplıydı ama bu suyun bileşimi tuzlu, asidik ve minerallerce yoğundu. Bu ortamda yaşamın doğrudan “yağmurla gelen hücrelerden” türemesi biyokimyasal olarak imkânsız.
The statement "The temperature was over 40°C, covered with water"  This is also inconsistent:  In the early Earth (4 billion years ago), the surface temperature was close to 100°C, or even higher.  At that time, the oceans were not fully stable; they were constantly evaporating and condensing.  A "mild" temperature of 40°C belongs to the "cooling period" (approximately 3.5 billion years ago), when life would emerge much later.  Therefore, "40 degrees and the rain of cells" cannot have occurred during the same period.
This narrative is based on the so-called "panspermia theory" (the idea that life came from space).  But there are two major scientific problems here:  Cells are living structures. In space, with its high radiation, cold temperatures near absolute zero, and vacuum, it is impossible for living cells to survive intact.  If cells had descended to Earth "like rain," it would have been nearly impossible for them to do so without burning or disintegrating upon atmospheric re-entry. Even the majority of meteorites burn.  In other words, this narrative ignores biological, physical, and thermodynamic realities.
This video is like a story about a formation. It says that cells began to rain down on the earth, a sign of life. The cell itself is a living being. If we can't ask questions about the nature of this life form, how it came into being, and from what source it rained, like rain, then we're still talking about mindless creatures that remain cellular in size. The story is beautiful, if you put reason aside. Considering this video as evidence for atheism is a sign of a lack of logic, and so is the ignorance that the universe is pregnant with new formations every second.
The beat drop right at the beginning of the video immediately told me this is a great hour of my life
This video helped me with my biology test. I appreciate it❤
❤
The first plant is cooksonia: cooksonia is one of the first plant ever on 400 million years and became extinct on 403 million years
I actually watch this too much, its soooo good for a background to revision. Would love to see a video similar to this but for the Phanerozoic, or specific eras within it, and having an epoch counter in the top right instead of period counter :)
I love the video so much❤❤. I played it again as my bed time story ,that good the video is.
Excellent content as always.
Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Really liked the structure of this video.
3:46 The Hadean period slaps
Cool vid. Dinosaurs were well cool. But you know what? It's all pretty lame compared post industrial revolution human society. These modern times are incredible compared to the the billions of years that preceded it.
Fun fact: you watch your life flash by 97000 times every time you blink
Yea it the Erin on first born earth
It is 4.6 billion years old
I blinked
lol I looked away at the end and missed all of human history
Think I found my new sleep video! What an amazing work of art. ❤
Im obsessed with this music 11:35
Where did that one bacteria or organism come from
This is basically an animated movie and we got it for free. As well as the amount of research and knowledge and EVERYTHING
Google Is
Do you know humans started as a fish THEN a monkey then us humes.
But it’s not realistic
This is just amazing
As a atheist, thinking freely and naturally i can understand this and i believe it,
I've watched this video so many times, but the end of the cretaceous and everything after always puts a lump in my throat. The music, the visuals, and the narration is incredible, no matter how many times I watch it I still get emotional. Amazing work as always.
dang
57:21 the adorable creature  Jokes aside, you are the only one who can make me an hour-long history of the Earth like a nature documentary. Well done!
Thanks for this great content.
Always enjoy watching your videos.
This was worth watching.
Imagine this but in [location].
I enjoyed watching this video.
And yet I can't take myself away from it
The music on the Mesoarchean phase is awesome. Bit prog metal/rock vibe
39:18
At the end of this hour, in the very final second, less than a second even, we go from cavemen to iPhones, the internet, and ChatGPT ☠️
amount of work bhind this😮
Very helpful and informative.
3:00 am I tripping or is the moon getting further and further away slowly
this probably took forever to make and sadly most people did not watch the whole video because of their low attention span. People that managed to watch the whole video (like me) have long attention spans and found some intresting moments and even learnt stuff along the way.
masterpiece
It is still crazy that if every person who lives right now was worth one year it would span over the history of earth TWICE!
I can't stop watching this video, thank you so much! ❤😃
Really good.  Some of the transitions could have been a bit less abrupt, e.g. during the early raining and lightning stage, I would still expect the odd asteroid strike.
this is great to watch when high😂
how the earth existed 4 billion years ago if the earth is only 2025 years old
so 1hour passes=4 billion years?
10:20
You just have to appreciate epic mountain. They had to create a whole album for this one video ...
The fact the humam history doesn’t even take a second of this hour long video gives me existential crisis 🙁
bro think he bill wurtz
Im watching all the ads no skip.. This is frickin awesome
this is the greatest youtube video of all time
Can you make battle Royale of every single creature to ever live but it’s through all of time?
We used this for science project. Very interesting.
Nature: creates gravity Evolution: I do not approve of this Birds can fly
Very good explanation.
Clear and easy to understand.
the animations give the wrong impression. in the Hadean period for example: the sky and moon should not be visible because of the volcanic ash, the moon should also not be visible but the light from the moon should be for a certain amount of time, the earth should be rotating daily, the animation are way too slow and at the speed of 1 million year every second there should be a massive quantity of eruptions (which are missing), the asteroids are also too slow (there should be way more and way faster) and many more things should be added in the video. the fact of the matter is that there are far better videos out there on this topic.
This video is mindblowing! gives way better prospective to the timescales of our world in general.  id reccomend your entire channel into the educational material!  great channel, great work you people do
Longest vid
look up Our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of Zeitoun, and Our Lady of Lourdes and the miracles there! And the Eucharistic miracles and the science and pictures behind them!  God bless! :D  Si no sabías, busca Nuestra Señora de Fátima, Nuestra Señora de Zeitoun, y Nuestra Señora de Lourdes y los milagros de esos eventos. También busca de los milagros Eucarísticos y la ciencia y fotos de esos milagros. Que Dios te bendiga siempre!! :D
Humans, a sneeze.
Bro one hour of such a detailed animation is insane, this probably took so many years to make, we might be hearing a recorded voice from 2018 and hearing it at 2023 - 2025
Very helpful and informative.
How long does it take
Yo the music goes insanely hard
Erm 🤓👆 You Missed The Making Of Onimai
Exactly what I was looking for.
One second is 3x the time that humans have been existing yet we evolved extremely rapidly and the fact that we can make and enjoy things like this is insane.😅
kinda sucks
"life, uh, finds a way" Understatement of the eon
Kurz can you make more planet terforming videos
Thank you for this it was an amazing perspective on how long it took life to begin and how Earth has evolved.
This the best video on youtube by a country mile. No other content is worth our time by comparison
that sounds like what Angela went through
I LOVE this channel
That was really impressive.
So during this entire video Mars couldn't even get a single cell of life?
When you watching ocean part: LET I GET OUT FROM THIS STUPID WATER BARRAGEEEEE WHY I CAN NOT SEE ANY TERRESTIAL
A very well done video.
Very nicely done.
Helpful content, thank you.
Omg
The background music makes no sense in a video like this, like why?
Perfectly explained without any confusion.
I understood everything perfectly.
Human history is just 1 second, but it is yet so detailed. The Romans felt so long ago, but in this video, t doesn’t seem like it
Oh heres gramp its a rock
Go outside look at a rock and tell me we came from that
We did not come from a rock
Lies lies lies
58:03 *Jurassic park theme*
I commend the cameraman who filmed this all in such a narrow, if not non-existent biosphere 🫡
Is the green stuff on the rocks at 28:05 supposed to be life or something else
Truly masterpiece, very informative. Thanks 🙏
I wonder what my neighbourhood looked like millions of years ago
Absolutely amazing. Made the kids watch it too !! They really chilled by half way through and learnt something even just about scale of time
The explanation was excellent.
Amazing music video! Though I found the animation in the background a bit annoying
Please make another video like this one.
I love science, it helps me understand just how God did what he did. So beautiful 💙
This has to be literally the best video ever dropped on Youtube. Incredible
I’d like alive wallpaper of this for my computer
AMAZEING I LOVE THE VIDEO IT TOOK ME 17 MILLION YEARS TO TYPE THIS
i think this had cured my short attention span forever…
❤
8:41 where does the rain come from?
This is how you do YouTube right.
He is talking about The Great Dying.
Everyone,he is talking about the Ordovician-Silurian Extinction
19:57 that riff hits really hard. The bass introduction was crazy too.
Fantasy
So,the Great Oxidation Event ,eh?
I mean,the oceans.
So,plants in the oceans colonize land.
The sound of colonization?
Huh?
Oh,blue sky=oxygen
Plus asteroid impacts.
So,playing The Floor is Lava,eh?
Takk!
Love it!   Can you make a version without talking?
This is the first ive ever seen of this channel, absolutely amazing work
Díky!
One of the best factory games I have ever played and its space too!
Better than every movie!
But how did the universe start?
Turn video to 2x speed for shorter duration
Thank you guys and your team for this amazing video, its still one of my favorite things to watch for long study sessions
That is super long time ago.🧠
Engaging storytelling helps serious content resonate
can you do a timeline of mars
45:53 omg kurzgesagt you didn’t have to go that hard 😮‍💨
Viewers reward transparency when creators discuss challenges openly
Fantastic video! Thank you so much for creating and sharing this with us
okay bill wurtz
20:50 this shit goes hard
00:00=Start 23:59=End
2:53 more like steam huh...
Wiw
Kurzgesagt, thank you for this. This is nothing short of brilliant.
The music of the mesoarchean... Uff
Friend: “ey homie, wanna chill?” Me: “nah bro, im already watching a cool movie.” Friend: “oh nice! What is it called?” Me: “‘4.5 billion years in an hour’”. Friend: “wat”
Horrible time to end the video. I feel scammed, curse you!
I feel like im at a rave that has the history of almost everything weaved into it 😂. I wouldve paid more attention in school if it were like this ❤
Ok so i have this thing with homework where i just wander off without music or a video but most of the time i just get distracted by said music or video.  ...This is not one of them, i find this very nice to listen too and i can actually do my homework (ignoring the fact that i SHOULD be making my homework right now but stopping to comment this).  So uhhh.  Thanks for the banger video even though this came out a year ago.
Earth is kind of a universal baby. Are you going to do one of the 13.8 billion years that is the whole universe? I guess you could cut off the 4.5 billion years of Earth. It would be a bit of prequel, after all.
Learning it in a book can never be compared to this. And the fact that we humans has only been here for such a small time was amazingly delivered. Thank you so much for providing this masterpiece for free.
I can see how one could listen to this in the background while studying.
Two years later and I still listen to this during work. One of he best videos!
You mean to tell me that there was an eternal night during calymmian period
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ마지막에 혼나고가네요😂 좋은 영상 감사합니다 잘보고잇어요 화이팅
INLOVE THIS
Musics are awesome !!!!!!!!
First of all the cameraman is literally a mortal like I’m not joking like how did he get to this timeline?
I kept forgetting I was watching a timeline and not just a dope screensaver
This video is ambitious af 💗
How’d you get the new Tool album for the soundtrack of this?
When I watched this a year ago, I don't remember there being ad breaks. Today, there are ad breaks every 7 minutes.
I know this was mostly intended to be watched on a second monitor or even in the background, but the animation was so pretty and I really didn't want to miss any of the cool changes so I was pretty much glued to it.
Rookie producer here, just want to give a shout out to the pluck synth in the beginning it's fire. Got my head bopping
Cool video, but the life apearing in the Neoarchean thing has been disproved through studies in abiogenesis. Life doesn't just appear from having the correct materials available.
Wish there was actual planet maps as you explore; I wondered once and couldn't find my ship again.
I am here for the background music.
45:00 1.2 billion years ago sex was invented 👏
This music goes so fucking hard
This deserves way more views.
Incredible,took me almost the entire Cretaceous to write this
무한한 순환이 반복되는 영겁의 시간앞에 인간은 한없이 짧구나..
I love how uncreative we are with names  Palaeoarchaeon: old ancient Mesoarchaeon: middle ancient  Neoarchaeon: new ancient  And we just reuse those basics multiple times haha
This is so Amazing to See a Animated Documentary about History of Earth 🌍. Great Work ❤️💯👏
Yes Ah
You messed up 2 billion years ago it was just water and rock there was nothing no living thing on the earth they only appeared at 539 million years ago not 2 billion the T. rex only appeared in Cretaceous.
I must say though education should not be monetized
This is so inaccurate… the earth was born 2k years ago 😂😂😂 jk
59:43 and then… the dinosaurs have gone extinct.
Nicely explained and easy to understand.
The music drop was a hilariously unexpected surprise 😂
Very neat and well explained.
For whatever reason, I felt emotional at the Eoarchian Period. Great video with beautiful animation and script
Good breakdown of the topic.
This really made me understand the magnitude and divinity of our planet. For some reason, we think that we are its main story, while we, our stories, our wars, nuclear weapons, inventions, happy moments, sad ones, crimes, the climate change we caused, everything we hold dear, is probably significantly smaller than the impact of ONE big meteor during the Hadean age, in Earth's history. We are nothing but a breeze. We need Earth more than it will ever need us.
Simple and effective explanation.
Animation so great ❤
Brilliant! Thank you so muchhhhhhhhh!!! Kurzgesagt forever!!!!🤩😍
Wow. It happened! This ONE ad actually made me laugh!! Bless them!!
This might be one of the best things on the entire internet ever.
oh wow 😮
came for the science, stayed for soundtrack
Such an interesting topic.
So creative!
that Siderian soundtrack, those early organisms certainly knew how to groove.
This made my day.
Absolute cinema
I wished for it to be more detailed as in what type of rain it was
Cómo amo esta animación y su música, siempre vuelvo cada cierto tiempo para estudiar o pasar un buen rato con las canciones
This video is crazy, truly a captivating experience
Truly inspiring.
What?Oxygen in the Atmosphere?
Minor correction: 7:40 - 8:04 Its Also in EOARCHEAN but this video took years so understandable
40:15 what are these
evolution does n ot exist like you claim. no proof of it. keep making things up
Thank you so much for this! Amazing!
HOLY SHIT 1 HOUR YOU REALLY OUTDID YOURSELVES
1:67  1:79  9:67
Ooo
29:43 There is a glitch to the rocks here. I mean, Kurzgesaght isn't always perfect!
I have an idea: Make Eons, Eras and Periods for before Earth and in the future!
This was amazing
So addictive.
Another plagiarism of the genesis. Just leave it be! Its told in the earth all around us. Make them go see for themselves!
A guy named Bill would be proud
Meanwhile, I'm listening to The Ocean.
47:57
Я осознавал это в течение часа, я все это наблюдал, и оказалось, что я все это знал, то есть я не узнал никакой новой информации я просто узнал названия периодов, но я также знал все эволюционные процессы Вы не упомянули скучный миллиард 1 миллиард начинается 800 миллионов лет назад и заканчивается 800 миллионов лет назад Вы не упомянули много других вещей
This is the one of the stupidest and waste-of-time videos I've ever seen. What's the point of making people watch the equivalent of paint dry for over 50 mins in a 1 hour video?
How does it feel to be done after 4.5 billion years of hard work
THAT changed Earth to what I see outside today?
Singlehandedly the best video on youtube
This is ridiculously good top tier content. “Well done” doesn’t quite cut it. Excellent music too.
You mean the Siberian Traps
You mean Neogene
You mean Paleogene
Had to come back to this midway through my Geology assignment 😂 Wish so many more people would appreciate content like this
This is truly an amazing video! Thank you!
I watched Earth's history in just one hour.
scpp
52:53 dont miss this
I kept saying 1.5 million years. 1.5 million years. 1.5 million years... every second.
This video and the pale blue dot are =.
Great video! It would be even better if it included Earth’s day length, the Moon’s distance, average surface temperature, atmospheric composition, and more.
..............
Stunning work.
I cant believe anyone would watch this video its so pointless watching this for 1 hour😂
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Those asteroids hit couple million years
So well presented.
All this things make me believe that God is Real
29:49 can someone explain? Did it create more water or was the stuff before different from todays water?
Ima Christian and don’t believe in evolution but still this animation is really good even if I don’t believe what it’s saying is true
Me in the Hadean: This is fine. *gets fire on hair*
The mion theory does not wash. Moon is made from diffrent rocks than earth.
alright now we need the other 10 billion years animated
this video is a huge gift! I can't wait until my school year starts again and I can play this on repeat during my study sessions! I also love the music in this film, such a good vibe to fit each era! Kurzgesagt is a-mazing <3
I want the music that starts with the Cretaceous period
Thanks!
this is the longest side scrolling platformer ever
you skipped palocene
when earth was about 1B years, almost nothing but a pool of hot lava, life sudently appears and somehow just keeps going. good job team
Our home? I don't think the planet is agreeing. Well, hopefully it will eject us soon, like we truly deserve it.
Wow I feel so old now, wait no, I feel so young... what ?
how is this free?
i like how basically nothing happened in the proterozoic eon and the hadean eon
Admit it, how many millions of years have you skipped?
*I started the video. It was a hellish Landscape.* *I went to poop, came back and there was life under water.*  *This must be what deities feel like.*
Please please make a human history version like this! 🤩
This is the best
This was such a good video!!! Loved watching
I remembered be and my bro being so excited when this vid cone out, hard to believe that a year had already past since then and the two of us had already graduate and rarely see each other
How does the moon be its normal self sorta thrn earth
59:48 and the dinosaurs are gone
Video was more lame than you expected don't lie
Y w
It's surprising that humans appeared for less than a second.
1:37 THE FLOOR IS LAVA
Me like this vid.... make more like plez
Creationists should watch this video. It's easy to take modern life for granted when you don't see how long it took to make it.
Just wanted to say that the soundtrack on this video is amazing. Feels like a modernized version of 90s era jungle music in games like super Mario 64 and ape escape.
fun fact: Axolotls as a species have only existed for about 10,000 years. :}
I never comment on videos. And I love this channel. But this is beyond insane and should be winning a tonne of awards or something. Nobel ones, probably.
4:38 the moon starts to cool
I love this video! The music is so good in certain parts. So chill.
Uhm, hello? Kurzgesagt team? You don't have the right to make me all teary eyed with that ending...
Amazing animation as always! I loved it!  The music was wonderful, roo.
This is fucking amazing.
Where can I get one?
My anxiety is through the roof. It'll take me the whole history of earth to calm down 🌍
Subhana l allah ❤
“Also, life is starting to eat the sun” Huh
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
2025 anyone?
Can you make the future of Earth in 1 hour, please? We really appreciate it!
This sounds pretty good sped up 22:21
I'd like to mention the unobtrusive and cool music, just a big kudos to the creators!
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
I want a dvd and poster.
Ectasian😊🎉❤😮
This is fascinating and beautiful. I would love for this to be a screensaver on my MacBook
52:05 sounds like a Minecraft background music ngl
If you like this look for the NASA video of the sun on YouTube, it's like 30 minutes long has similar soundtrack
I think entertainment that incorporates music might be a smart new way to do movies in the park or roller skating educational night ,  theme park background tvs etc.   Places where the TV is not the center of attention
I wonder how big of a file size is for the unedited raw 4.5 billion years fotage is
37:36 the last 1 second is going to be wiiiiild
If we have earth's history, you should do human civilization and achievements in 3 hours
Me missing like 50,000 years just for blinking
every second is 75000000 years 👍
That was beyond or more than almost 5 billions years ago of all earths!!!
Ngl, I think I saw a molicule of my left pinky toe at 27:20.
10:25
Good job. This is great!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊😊😊😊❤😊❤😊😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤
I love it!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉🎉❤
The thing up there is the moon
Humans occupy one second of this History, yet look how much damage we have done to our home. 😢😢
This video seriously rocks, you guys always kill it with the music, i really felt like i was going on a deep primal journey
This is amazing!!!!!, and also good Music for my headphones.
Man.. i blinked when the man with the funny mustache was starting a war....
EASILY one of my favorite videos of all time no doubt.
written this in the siderian. took 200 million years to write
I know this is already a. Year old but can you make a shorter version
If there isn't any oxygen on earth in the mesoarchean , how'd it rain water prior to that for a billion years? Water has a oxygen molecule.
In real life GOD made the earth in the beginning
Wow, the music in this vid tremendously beats ass. The mesoarchean music is just 🤌
What's these places I never seen them before then what's these strange names?
Mr science bird it might be the sleep deprivation but I like your videos while I play Minecraft it makes me feel less lonely and they are very interesting
1 hour of this guy?  𝓨𝓮𝓼 𝓹𝓵𝓮𝓪𝓼𝓮 Took 32 days and only has 702K likes?  𝓤𝓝𝓓𝓔𝓡𝓡𝓐𝓣𝓔𝓓𝓓𝓓𝓓𝓓!
Love it
I don’t watch this channel as much as I used to but reliably I go back to this channel almost every time im in a very low space. I love this channel a lot. I’ve donated and bought merch. Please don’t ever stop what you’re doing. This video in particular is just so fun but videos like the “optimistic nihilism” ones keep me going.
Such a small part of such a tale. And even that tale is just a small part of the book.
Well, that Stenian age intro came out of nowhere
Amazing Video!
Not just HADDEN and paleorchen everything takes too long
Why HADDEN and paleorchen and all takes too long?
Watched the whole thing. Absolute cinema.
THIS IS AMAZING
37:08 self sustaining nuclear reactor?  This is a great video, everything is perfect. Really shows the timescale of earth and our life. The soundtrack is perfect.
cool
You are the coolest people in the world
Person: Where am I?  Hold on, let me switch to (0.25^6)x playback speed.
Wow, what an amazing video. Such a great channel!
that cretaceous music feels like heaven on earth, and  Neogene bgm is amazingggg!!!!
this shi got me tearin up somehow
Loved this video, you can tell it was made with love and dedication.
I love how you slowly watch earth as it goes from a hell to a home in the earlier stages, water very slowly replacing lava, lighting taking place of meteorites. A lot of underwater gases to a few! Really cool detail, same with the music matching the time period. This animation must have taken ages, it’s really good!   59:40 “such a paradise! Life is thriving!” “Nothing can go wrong 😼”…. “Wait what’s that 😨” “And an astroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on earth, such a bummer 😕”
“And an asteroid killed all the dinosaurs. Such a bummer!” Lmao so sarcastic
Amazing video
i didn’t realise how most of life was just microscopic. I had this video on my watch later playlist for a year and regret not watching it sooner (or when it first released). But nevertheless, it was an eye-opening video. I didn’t watch it in the background as intended, but it was still good!
Times I rewatched this video: 3
This is a German plot to make you listen to techno music.   Shit... like it now.
I love this so much.This is sooooooooooooo good!
This is my favorite episode! Love the music too. I’ve seen this over 50 times. Boggles my mind that 1 sec is 1.5 million years
Tool was heavily influenced by Tonion era music.
Just as I suspected.  Music was way cooler 2 to 4 billion years ago.
On this timescale, the sun only has a bit over an hour left before it explodes... Really depressing stuff
Watching this high is amazing
Those beats are banging!
Hey kurtzgesagt, i know you'll probably never see this comment, but I wanted to express my thanks for your creations and all your knowledge. I've been going through a really bad depressive episode since the start of summer and have been stuck in the same loop of eating, watching youtube and laying in bed. But the lack of action within this vido had inspired me to fjnally get up and clean my room a bit and actually take care of myself. Nothing intrests me more than the science behind history and i thank you all so much for providing that in little bit sized pieces! 💛💛💛
This looks like it could be a videogame
I am still looking at it in 2x playback speed
Forgot the time i ate in preschool. I wont be watching this channel anymore get your facts right.
Not only is this video amazing but the music at times reminds me of Tool which is so fitting.
anyone else really high and tripping to this?
wow
Well done! Thank you!
at least 1milion of the views of this video are mine
ho did u just fix my attention span
Wonderful job! ❤❤❤
I can’t wait to see the first arthropods
This is so so cool awesome and amazing I can’t believe that I get to see this
The earth was really red and orange
The is moon basically the sun in the hadean
All of earths history in 1 hour, this is such a great video!  😍
Amazing
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
I can tell you the history in one word, (God).  God bless everyone. Amen 🙏 ❤.
❤
1:00:38 smallest time 0:54 big tine
The music is so annoying it makes it harder to get through the video, which, BTW , is magnificent although also a bit tedious.
Tonian Eon 47:38
This video was touching my soul! Great job!
I don’t want to take ANYTHING away from this beautiful animation… THE MUSIC why is no one talking about this choice of music it fits in PERFECTLY.
¡Gracias por existir, son maravillosos!
45:00 crazy to think that this is what set in motion a series of events which would culminate in feet fetishes
brilliant video! I wouldnt mind one without the 'music' though... ;)
The music in this is spectacular.
This would make such a cool screensaver.
Jesus is God
wow
The music makes it seem like 100 Trillion years,
At 12:40 theres a glitch
Why do the moon look like the sun 🤨
I took a Billion year nap
It take forever
00:43 Germany?🇩🇪
Perfection 👌
1:42 bro took floor is lava seriously
This is so good, please make more and better videos!
1:00:54 oh my
What a Soundtrack!! Bloody Brilliant!
I guess the best 1 year i spent
I can't explain it but something about this video makes me feel like we really might be in a simulation...
29:43 why did it glitch?
I hope Dr. Zakir Naik sees this video.
Seeing human history reduced to a single moment in this video truly changes how you view life and time itself
This music is the shizznitz
45:05 I was waiting for the sex update
27:13 Spore 2
The Paleoarchean stage was my favorite I really loved the sun in the background.
How long did it take to make this?
This is not actually real this did not happen but still good job👍
43:14  Watch the animation❌ Listen to the background music ✅🔥
Uh…is this Steve Taylor talkin’?
Steve was right. You are all right
This video is faker than Professional Wrestling and gayer than Sir Elton John
Wheres the big ice-teroid collision? It didnt just start sprinkling. U dont know what happened or how it went down
The ony thing this video proves was Hades existed on earth forever then fairy rain came along
🎉none of this spins like your supposed globe earth model
Hell is real and took 4,600,000,000 years to form. Pray to science and believe to God you don't go back to the Hadean era.
This isn't how hell formed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I consider this video an ODE to TIME. Look at what fascinating things happen as Time passes... when I wanted to stop watching when I realized that it was still taking a long time, I scolded myself because it would be disrespectful to Time, like, yes I can give 1 hour of my existence to contemplate the God Time.
this is my favorite video
me waiting for multicellular organisms , 53:20 , like damn  Overall a great video and really informative 👏👏👏
Thanks for most of your work. I hate your socially progressive nonsense, including climate change alarmism.
That neoarchean track is sweet!
well good thing ive procrastinated making my cheat sheet for my final test tomorrow
The Mesoarchean scene also could double as a scene of what Earth will look like 1 billion years in the future… with the oceans slowly simmering away under a sub-giant sun in a wet-greenhouse atmosphere
Came for the science. Stayed for those sick beats, yo.
It really is insane to think that Earth has been through all this!! I love this video and I love how you tell the story x Defs a 10 out of 10 video for me x thxx x
That one guy who watched the entire 1 hour video without skipping 😂😂
Sau video này, tôi không còn cảm thấy như mình đang ngồi ở hiện tại. Như thể tôi vừa trôi qua bụi vũ trụ, núi lửa và những giấc mơ chưa sinh ra về một hành tinh trẻ. Mê. Thật sự cảm ơn bạn.
“La materia che ti compone ha viaggiato per miliardi di anni, forgiata nel cuore delle stelle, per diventare te: un frammento cosciente d’universo che contempla sé stesso.”
I think there are bunnies too
Yes
Earth is only 6,000 years old. This is false
"I learned a lot from this video! Do you plan on making more videos like this?"
No, thank you! Those videos are inspiring.
This time travel so amazing
Such a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful video. Thank you guys very much for this.  All your videos mean so much to me.
This and, "History of the entire world I guess" are my two favourite history videos (Sorry for bad spelling)
Awesome concept, but you could’ve filled in so much information especially the first half of the video. BIFs, discussion of the first life, how it formed, first rocks, etc etc
You believe in this?
This is the best kurzgesagt video. The soundtrack is also great.
This video is SO GOOD how dare youtube not show me this earlier, Its been a YEAR, I loved every moment of this and the sound design was incredible
Loved it!!!
The Earth and Moon are flat dummies
28:52 how do u see that clearly why is it so clear? explanation plz
because something is liveing
I'm scared
What if dinosaurs weren’t extinct end by the asteroid, and continued to evolve to human-level intelligence, what would the world looks like today?
Man,This video is AWESOME,The voice,the design,the concept are so cool this is awesome 😎 when we get this free .
So the mesoarchean was the age of tornadoes
If each human year of life was one million, that'd be cool . js
i watched the whole video. its so good!! im 5th grade and learning from this channel. btw, roadway of 2019 to 2025 is 6 years!!
I want more...sorry, I request more
a whole hour video and I guess humans didn't even span 1 second of it...
Mesoarchean is said to be very hostile environment although the music was quite good back then.
It's amazinggg
Rave 🤖🤖🤖🤖🔌
It's just so astonishing our earth is so old and the humans are just lesser than a second i like this thanks 😊😊😊
It's time to go big to create the big bang and universe version please❤❤
I really love the attention to detail of the moon shrinking as time passes on the Hadean eon.
to put it even more into perspective, if this video was 100 hours long, the last woolly mammoth would have lived up until the last 0.32 seconds of the video. The rest happens in a literal blink of an eye
wonderful video
45:03 im still waiting for the sequel
Why are the most interesting videos never in the Spanish version of your channel? I would be able to do other stuff instead of just paying to this if it was in my language 😅 Please consider it
I watch this every time i do makeup
These are the things I’d be watching at 3 AM
58:50 song name?
La mejor rave de mi vida
The fact that everyone experienced this but didn't "form" yet surprises me tbh
Everybody who didn't know they needed this  |  |  V
Wow
best video on ytube
Props to the cameraman for time traveling
The floor is?  LAVA!!!!
They really did say "history of the entire universe, I guess"
Insane commitment
Alternative title: The Ocean's discography in a nutshell
one of those few videos that literally everyone should watch
16:00
This is the history of Earth
Nice video.
I remember watching this video when it first came out now it says how its been out for one year, crazy how time passes by.
This video is genuinely so relaxing, you can just let the calming music play while doing much of anything, the music makes it easy to forget what’s going on and slip into an almost trance-like state. Don’t believe me? I feel asleep with this playing on the bus.
29:44 Glitched lanscape? We all live in a simulation!
Absolute wonderful work. Music also balanced well😀
Allah is the greatest. Amazing video
All lies. God created everything and the Earth is not even close to billions of years old.
This is definitely perfect for studying the entire history of Earth! Thank you Kurzgesagt for this video!
Meteors must've been way slower back then, considering some take roughly 2 million years to hit earth from low orbit.
The music is an absolute vibe. Love it!
You should have shown the Orosirian asteroid.
45:00 new thibg to mutter to myself in a quiet crowd of people while im baked out of my mind
this is one of my favorite videos ever right after the one thats like the same concept but by bill wurtz and focuses way more on human history
This is my favorite YouTube video of all time. This deserves way more views. I watched this around 500 times now I remember every eon.
正確1億年前
just imagine watching this on LSD
No way this is 1 year old already.
This must have taken forever
The most important thing that is not even discussed by this video is that out of the 4.5 Billion years, no time has passed at all. You heard me right it is the same exact time now as it was 4.5 Billion years ago. That is simply due to the fact that time as we know it does not exist at all. Time is nothing more than a conceptual manmade tool that exists purely in the mind and not at all in reality. For time to exist there needs to be something called the Past the Present and the Future. The past only exists in the form of memories that is it. So the past only exists as a thought form and only when you are actively thinking about events based in a past. When you don't think about the past it ceases to exist. The future only exists as imagination and speculation. The present is the only thing that does exist as it is eternally Now. You can't escape Now to go to the past or future you are always experiencing things and events Now.
Happy birthday to Earth now it's a billion years old  	🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It is crazy that Earth was burning hot to cool
1:02:30
our history being short is more of a flex than not. it shows how we were able to dominate  in the midst of giant mammoths
I’ve been watching the subtleties in the animation so far… Omg, your poor animators must have put their souls into this. This is a legit work of dedication, inspiration, and art. I fell in love with this channel since I was young. I actually learned to love my body by appreciating the intricacies of my immune system. If all those tiny cells are fighting so hard for me then I am worth it regardless of others❤   I have loved this channel for years and will passionately continue to do so. Massive love to all you working at Kurtzgesagt!!💗
When you really think about, many times you think life is long (I'm 14 so the passing of time is slower for me than you) but even that does not, not even close, compares to the fact our species have only been around for so long, but still, so little of time compared to how long this rock angular revolve have lived and existed. So many things we haven't experienced, which are unimaginable, and still, that's just one planet out of so many a biological computer, such as us, could never comprehend.  This may sound impossible, but one day, judging from the fact I have watched your channel's videos for since I was 8-9, I think I'll have the knowledge to construct a working time machine, using particles to envelop the space I'll be in to travel forwards and, if it is merely possible, backwards through Earth's history and discover Her secrets.
where is the megalodon??
BS ... GOD MADE MAN
Thanks!
🔥🔥🔥
welp
The first animals start at about mni 55:00 ish
Honestly Earth peaked in the Mesozoic, mostly Cretaceous, and we've been trying compensate for the lack of Archosaur radness with our nerd thinking skills. Snore. Get good humans.
The Ediacaran Biota is still Quite a Mystery, since most of the Biota has no Living Relative Today, And Since All of the Biota is Soft and has no Bones, well, Fossils are possible, but rare, heck, Some of the Biota We only know from a Single Fossil, Anyways, Hope Someone could Benefit from this Information, Just Saying Alr
50.10 da ilk avcı tek hücreliler ortaya çıktı diyor. 2 milyar yıl öncesinde ise bakterilerden biri diğerini yedi ilk ökaryot hücre oldu demişti. Avcı bakteriler avcı ökaryotu oluşturuyor ama ökaryot avlanamıyor mu
Props to the cameraman for filming for over a billion years.
Amazing video, and amazing work @kurzgesagt. Thank you so much for bringing all of this to us for free! The animations in the video are SO PRETTY, really well done!
Kinda crazy this video will be relevant for millions of years.
its amazing to me how scientists found out all this history from 4.5 billion years ago
:)❤❤😂😜
Oh no, I blinked...
great bgm
I adore the birds in the credits
I would love to see a extremely detailed video from kurzgesagt about the history of Earth in the future.
Very very cool. Great perspective.
camera man really is a god aint it
Exactly 1 hour before my History exam. Thank you so much!
59:49 The era of the titanoboa snake
this video REALLY helps me sleep. its fantastic, and i really love the music. the eoarchaean is my favorite section, because i love rain! \o/
The music for the Rhyacian period is awesome.
The fact millions of years are racing by and the planet is still molten at the surface is astounding.  The amount of heat that needed to be shed into space for things to cool down is unimaginable.  I get impatient when the frying pan won't cool down within 10 minutes.
The floor is lava
Mesoarchean sounds a little bit like the doom music
Great video, thank you very much, Watched all of it…. 1:01:40
Great video, thank you very much, Watched all of it…. 2:00
4,5 Billion years of history… and we’ve existed for only 12,000 years… 🤯
I can't imagine how long it took to make this video, for animating, researching, and the music. Massive respect
Aliens watching the new season of earth:
11:22 still not as much as it rains during an average Houston thunderstorm
I like the Hadean eras lofi! It’s really good. :)
This whole video I can describe as absolutely mesmerizing, and hypnotic.   You outdid yourselves.
I didnt even make it past the HAdean era before I fell asleep lol. My new night time video!
10:39 Fireballs disappeared
this video's so good that by the time I finished writing this comment, the dinosaurs already went extinct
the title is wild
Humanity living on Earth in the last few seconds is like cancer on steroids
this was incredible thank you so much for the time and effort
I love the music. Thank you for the effort of making this! I know it probably took like 834863896935889 hours.
i really did appreciate your video, it's so wonderful but this is the best medicine for my sleep. it's not boring but it can take me to sleep in the good way. really love your animation
What it took probably took too long to comprehend Hope you keep these masterpieces in shape! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My eyes have now seen the entire evolution of Earth
34:21 they hit the second tower!
Puberty hit me a little around the 3 minute mark
climate activist should watch this
03:15 Shouldn't there be Tsunamis of Magma from eruptions, comets, etc?
53:45 Anomalocaris 🙂
51:13 that was COOL
It shows how ephemeral life truly is
Hold on now, my pastor told me the moon, sun and stars came AFTER dry land and vegetation.    I DEMAND the truth be told.   GENESIS 1.
18:00 Now you can eat sunlight.
Amazing!! What's the name of the last track?
Crazy it took until 52 minutes for multi-cell lifeforms to start
How on Earth are people able to find out about all this?! It blows my mind we can find out what earth was like 4 billion years ago
AMAZING WORK.

ASMR MUCH?  You make me unwind.
Thank you for your efforts.
I love all the silence of narration, as nothing changes over the first few billion years 😮
This was truly a click bait ! Disappointed
Never knew that comments take 9,00000 years to be made.
Fantastic❤

I am SO high right now. Thank you stoned brain. Always leads me down a good path.
All of human history is one frame of this video
33:50 where animation? >:(
""what i don't see is every time a race started acting like humans"" according to you guy's human apes have been around for what a fraction of the time is it not being condescending to the rest of the animal species that might have been just as smart if not smarter then the human today considering the predicament that we have gotten ourselves into (global warming, wars, greed just like any animal would
Star/Planet   ❤  I love science 🥹
Im here from their most recent video("your time machine broke"), wanted to see Devonian, Carboniferous and triassic.
I can't imagine the work that went into this and I have to say I love it! If you guys are able to make more long videos like that I would love them, I'd love to one day have a whole series of long kurzgesagt videos like this to study to!
It is just mindblowing to think that oxygen came to the atmosphere only after over half of the present age of the planet had come and gone.
39:54 did the guy spit?
Happy Earth Day! It’s time to appreciate on how our plan has come through aeons and we live in just snippet of our planet’s history.
It’s pronounced Hades
1 hour amazing video
That was cool, but I was disappointed there wasn't a single trilobite. In fact, it was extremely sparse on fauna even after watching it for fifty minutes and expecting it would pick up since most of history didn't have complex life and was just scrolling along reusing the same animation for each age. Neat to show just how deep deep time gets, but if you are one of the few who actually watched the whole thing the last ten minutes that was supposed to be interesting was mostly empty and felt a bit rushed.
I watched this whole thing in one sitting, my attention span is cured
This is pretty awesome.  I'm gonna show this video to my nieces and nephews. <3
Mesmerized from beginning to end (The bird icons are so cute!?? Biodiversity to the max)
video starts out with "uth".  what is "uth"?
This is giving me Birthday’s the Beginning vibes
Funny, It took so lang to be Our home we know now and it took US human 2k years to destroy IT all, its we are a parasitic infection for out Planet and it need smt like a anti flea shampoo or stm
Fun fact: this was published two days after my birthday
5:30 Here I noticed that the Moon is getting a bit darker, meaning it’s cooling down and forming a surface ❤
it must've been real hard getting all this footage
Can someone explain how did we get rain?
would be great if all videos was in spanish and all demanded lenguages too. Thanks for the effort
Do this with mars next
This is so 🔥
I think 🤔 today's Earth core crust is result of raining of asteroids for millions of years  in past which enriched our earth from all 119 elements came from Space
That's ❤the thing i ❤the things of science it tells everything much precise   than any religious false imaginary stories
12:50 "But we  don't know...".  That got me first time watching, because only a true pro would acknowledge their own limitations in open. One year later this is _still_ one of my go-to videos, watching and enjoying while my FreeBSD box is building from scratch (/usr/src FTW!).
bad word💀💀💀💀💀
කවුරු ආවත් තව අවුරුදු බිලියනයකින් පෘථිවියේ ජීවයක් නෑ 🔥🔥🔥
it amazes me that any randomly paused frame, is like the most beautiful wallpaper you could find
Thanks!

They had ran is depressing
TICKETS TO THE KURZGESAGT MOVIE!!!
53:12 life finds a way
This is Amazing!!!!
Imagine going back in time and standing on hot black rock, hundreds of meters below where the Pacific Ocean will one day be.
Dislike. Too Much Lies
This video is so good! ❤😊
How many months did thia take.
Nice work kurzagastg 6:18
If you waited a whole hour watching this video you’re a legend like I did
Guys did you realise we were waiting for a hour and lots of years and kurzgesagt did you realise my comment when I first started watching but it’s in a different video 3:54
You’ve got really cool pictures though 😊 3:25
You’ve got really cool pictures though 😊 3:25
That’s it the first time I watched this I ate 2 chocolate pancakes well watching and finished them before the hour finished 2:56
This perspective helps us see that the world is 4.5 billion years old, and we are just a brief moment in its history. But with the gift of consciousness, we have the ability to shape and nurture our evolving ecosystem. Instead of relying on our 'fight or flight' instincts, we can work on adaptive multifaceted blueprint in public society system, the ability to create balance and harmony, as part of the greater interconnected whole.

i know this channel has 23million+ subs but for what it posts it should have been half of the whole world`s population
Danke!
40:03 the Calymmian is the most beautiful eons of Earth's history 😢😢😢😢
18:01 kurzgesagt: "life is starting to eat the sun"            Sun: OH F**K! They've started to       eat me! 😭😭😭😭😭
It makes me realize seriously how small we are, hence we consider ourselves as an eternity but we are not even a drop in the ocean. So, that means our problems don’t even exist hey you smile 😃
We want more
I say this as a fan, but you really could do this in 15-20 mins. The music and video are fine, but stretching it so far ends up feeling repetitive, and its not quite interesting enough to be a visualizer or sound track let alone a science journey. I do love your work tho, keep experimenting!
Chill beats for you to time travel to
ok 😍😍😍
Kurzgesagt, I’m choosing your video to explain the creation of the earth to my seven year old daughter. There is sooo much she can’t grasp yet but she finds your video incredibly awesome and exciting. Thank you for making content that even children can appreciate!
i cant believe i watched it all
that was amazing!
Atheists will tell you earth has been around for 4.5 billion years but the video clearly shows it was an hour
Fantastic video, I hope they show this in schools.
Bill Wurtz: 19min Kurzgesagt: 1hr
Is there a way to get this as a  live desktop wallpaper?
Music 24:00 reminds me of Oxygen Not Included
before viewing i expect to hear the sun is a deadly laser
And ppl still think religion is real 😂

ii insanity cameos
Mesoarchean goes hard.
Wonder Pals
They think we may have had our own ring system 500-450million years ago during the Ordovician, but perhaps if it began sooner, it might explain why the Earth froze over randomly in the Cryogenic era.
Thank you for making this video. I know a year in I am a bit late in commenting, but I just found it today, and I really loved watching it. I had it on in the background while running an experiment. It was great.
we are all anomalies
55:13  FISHY TIME
54:07  that fish must be moving pretty slow if every second is 1.5 million years😂
This is the best animated documentary of history I've ever seen
i just blink about 1 million years
This is so mind-blowing how many challenges our earth has overcome.
45:13 💀
Good music though!
25:18
Bedankt
Glad to say I watched this while playing cod
❤❤❤Fucking beautiful ❤❤❤
on the mesoarchean era right now,excited for the others!!!
It wasn't the big bang who created the earth it was god who created earth the first human is Adam and eve not the big bang
1:00:00
Hadean 0:54
This was an absolutely incredible journey through time. Great job
The background music is just too perfect fir the visuals❤❤
God made earth tho…
◽◽◽
29:43 There's a glitch there.
1:00:09 That make me smile hearing tnat.  This video is beautifully done 👍👍👍🎉
That’s cool but wrong
This is not a biome. This is actually a lava planet.
One time, I was super stoned, and I watched this and The Big Lez Show.  I rewound one of them and thought I time traveled a few hours into the past.
Jesus, what we consider "Life" on Earth doesn't make up even 10% of the video.
Watched all of it
Yo thank you man this video helped me know the history and secrets of the earth! Keep up the good work!
What the name of music?
Bro especially the last few minutes were literally so beautiful i started reflecting on my whole life and existence.I can't believe i didn't watch this till now it is truly a masterpiece
I just love this video it has convinced me that Earth is beautiful and really, really old. Thank you for making this.
lovely music
안녕하세요. 저는 도덕 과제로 선플달기를 하고 있는 중학교 3학년 학생인 한국인 시청자 입니다. 당신의 퀄리티 높은 시각적 디자인과 영상미는 제게 큰 영감을 불러일으킵니다. 이 댓글을 단 영상은 그 중 가장 아이디어가 뛰어나다는 생각이 듭니다. 시대의 흐름을 시간에 따라 지켜본다는 생각은 어떻게 하시는 겁니까. 평소에도 즐겨보지만 이 도덕 과제를 받고 가장 먼저 떠오른 대상이 Kurzgesagt 님 이었습니다. 언제나 좋은 영상 감사합니다.
The music is so good! ❤
la musica la animacion, la escala de tiempo, el entender que la humanidad no tiene nada de existir comparado con la tierra, lo pone a uno a pensar que no llegamos a ser ni una mota de polvo y lo complejo y la suerte que tiene q tener para se cree vida como la hay en la tierra en otro lado
the description “Earth is 4.5 billion years old - which is approximately the same amount of time it took us to create this video.” LOL i can only imagine.   this is so unbelievably amazing, the animation, the music, the concept itself, the execution, and of course the calm voice of steve. its absolutely amazing and puts things into perspective like nothing else i’ve seen. it uses something that most things these days don’t use, time itself. the length of the video with the ending hits hard, because of the time it took to get there. unlike any other comparison or size difference or numbers shown in a video, the time difference you actually feel if you sit through it. the closest i’ve ever felt and conceived the shear difference in size and scope of any scientific concept.   i never have donated on youtube before, this is the perfect channel to donate to. you guys left a mark on scientific education and have gotten so many curious for the unknown. i’ve been a long time fan and will be for a long time more, love you guys ❤
Wow this masterpiece dropped year ago and I see it now ❤
Me at the start: "Lets watch this because i wanna know history!" Me at the end: "i have knowledged EVERYTHING about this planet. I know everything."
“Don’t blink, or you might miss all of human history” That really shows the fact that our journey to us was long but in the grand scheme of Earth’s timeline, we’re really just in the beginning of human history
good content
You can make a new one but with human history
fantastic video! 🤩🤗
watching this while playing ark, honestly might come (replace the "o" with "u" and remove the "e")                         :)
how did it start to rain if there weren't oceans?
I LOVE THIS!!! for some reason its so engaging!! ❤
9:04  how did the water get thaere anyways?
I like this kurzgesagt
The misanthropy in this chanel is crazy
Aliens existed, we just didn't get to see them. There's locational space, and then there's time.  Maybe star wars did happen and we're late af to the party.
200만큼 처맛고 있어 환경이 더러워진 머리카락 처자르기  사건 말하는건가..

This is satisfying
Moral question for everyone (no wrong answers)… Seeing it took billions of years to become habitable and then hundreds of millions to evolve life to what we know it today, if we find a goldilocks planet do we have the right to inhabit it? Consider we would be forever altering that world, preventing the natural order of advancement which could, without our intrusion, lead to a species as thinking and feeling as us?
39:53 Did he spit?
Great content with missing in depth narration. I have hundreds of questions now... Anyways, thanks for your hard work!
My DJ set:
1:00 who’s gonna tell him God created everything and this isn’t how the earth came to be
Bro please go read the Bible
most of the video   the sun is a deadly lazer
the oceans in the second era was also formed by a meteors that had a bit of water on them
love it!
1:36 the floor is lava reference
I love at the end each member gets there own Bird
Way to go scientists for naming the inventors of sex "Bangiomorpha Pubescens"
Came here from the german channel, just to rewatch this beauty with english narration and upping that bass to this incredible banger.
I love your vids bro
Beautiful video
I had to weed through the weirdos but I finally found a British gent to teach me
Jesus is king❤
I love the sound tract in this
0:03 Well, make the big lie up front, and then run with that! Actually, Jesus Christ spoke this world into existence roughly 6,000 years ago.
The camera man ☠️
Me skipping  4 billion years In 5 min😂
Millions of years of rain. Just to imagine we'd live on a planet with never ending rain, all day, all year, always raining, forever. A science fiction setting I'd like to get explored.
Finally! Everyone comes to realise the incredible talent of Epic Mountain!
Yesirrrr
I love this video it helped me make a timeline on paper
This is amazing
I'm just jamming the music, the knowledge is a bonus.
Reading sailor Moon while watching this video 🤣
this is just recorded history btw.  Like all the random stuff happening in tiktok will never be recorded so imagine all the random stuffs happening between those billions of years
I wonder why the music is so undescribable at 24:12
Perf vid for after my walk…. Looking at the stars🌕🌝⭐️
Thank you. I would love to see this for the Solar System or the Galaxy. It would also be cool if you did videos that visualize topics by animating how they interact; more show than tell. These could even be done as shorts if you want to expand into that area of Youtube.   A cool idea, evolution; a long video showing the evolution of animals in a way that explains the "complexity" argument that Creationists use by showing how the eye could not only evolve from a simple photoreptor but how it could evolve independently. Again, by showing more than telling.   Thank you again for this new video style.
Art: 10/10 Animation: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Narration: 10/10 Not to mention how genuinely interesting and informative it is. Best bit of entertainment ive seen in awhile.
It’s still don’t make sense for me
"And do fun-guy" things" lol
Autistic person here! I have a special interest in history, but ESPECIALLY per-history like this. I just ABSOLUTELY LOVE it so much like AAAAAAAA!!!! This is genuinly my favourite video on the entire YouTube platform!!! I love it so much, I listen to it as a background all the time!! Have seen it at least like 3 times, and plannig on seeing it more!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAAADJFGUDHBJVJ!!! Also respect to the animators, this much animation must've taken SOOOOOO long!!!
If time was moving this fast you would probably be dead in less than 0.00000005333 seconds
How insane is it that we were somehow created by this whole event. Life is gift it’s crazy that we are here existing 🙌🏽
I have a roughly 1hr long task i need to do at the end of my workdays and i play this in the background. Helps me stay on task. I've watched it so many times already
If you reproduce it at 2X the speed you can use it in a Science class and elaborate a timeline with the students
The music composer(s) should look into making background tracks for video games (if they haven't already)! Clearly there's a great understanding there of flow and atmosphere, I'd love to hear tracks like the mesoarchaean, neoarchaean and rhyacian in something like ratchet and clank or I dunno, subnautica or something. Y'know? That like sci-fi sound that I can just vibe to as I play, or even casually outside of the game. And the leitmotif melodies that subtly come in and out are so good. Absolutely a musical journey as much as a visual one. Such a lovely piece of work all around, bravo Kurzgesagt team <3
People who watch this vid NO skip ⬇
I am a geologist and this video has become a ritual to me. Whenever I am doing mapping, writing papers or studying rocks, I am listening to this!
My science teacher would assign videos to watch for homework, but if I cant find a video of you on this topic, I will watch a few mins of it before getting bored and asking chatgpt to summarise it but if I find a video of you on the topic I watch it with out getting bored. I started watching this because I love your videos, and I find them so ever so fascinating. You really make my days better, and I hope the best for you :)
I love this video ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone else who watched the whole video
This really goes in line with the creation story if you think about it
amazing
okay but this music is a bop
Congratulations on your 10th year well done!!!
We have 19 minutes version of this video and it's awesome.
Wow I luv it 😍 thanks a bunch🙏
17:48
That was three seconds at best of a freaking hour long video where a human is shown. Everything all and every human that has ever lived, breathed, eaten, studied, written, cared, fucked, killed, and died all condensed into three seconds at best out of an hour long video of the geological timescale. How absurdly insignificant are we?
Man this music is bussin 🎶
Just the fact that this isn’t just a bunch of gifs 👌
One blink of an eye is 12 years worth of history studying in school 😅
Jesus is king repent for you sin (meaning to apologise to The Lord and try your hardest to live the life Jesus wanted us too) please I wanna see you guys in heaven
God created it all
This is what I will listen to while studying. Thank you kurzgesagt, this must’ve been quite hard work.
The lord created the universe 5000 years ago.  The Bible is proof
58:40 immediate chills The soundtrack game me a whole flashback to the timelapse of the future video Got me in tears, this video so beautiful dawg 😭
this is the best
I’m just now being made aware of this video….. it’s awesome btw
58:12 The Jurassic Park reference was one of the 4.5 Billion cherries on top of this heavenly creation.
Where is adam and eve ?
What about a 2-hour prequel covering period from the Big Bang to the formation of Earth?
"its boring being a cell"  "this is a huge upgrade"
how the hell are you doing that right now but you are not going anywhere and call you want me right back when you
Proper use of YouTube
I love this channel so much
Thank you very much for the video. Reminds me of Larry Gonick's "Cartoon History of the World". Thanks again.
All of our life struggle are definitely insignificant to this huge world
I feel like I’m looking a gift horse in the mouth for asking this, but would it be possible to do this for the future? Starting today and ending with Earth’s destruction from the Sun’s expansion into a red giant?
A completely different perspective I got from your videos. Thanks for making such meaningful videos.
24:19 2763
it is insane I love this.😀
I always get so sad when this video gets to the KT extinction, like life really was thriving, and then some stupid asteroid had to come along and ruin everything 😭 poor dinos, man
51:20 Life survived from small pools of liquid water which formed when dust/small rocks touched the ice, melting some of the ice.
9:41 is this acid rain or regular rain 🤔 just curious.
the video is now a year old can you pls do a updated video ?
Thank you 😊
2:34
If the Earth was covered with water during the Mesoarchean and the atmosphere was very hot, wouldn't the water keep evaporating into clouds, and it would constantly rain?
i finished it in 2mins ngl
Watching while high, amazing.
i guess we really have a lot to thank for prokaryotes being able to survive on chemical energy to handle multitudes of mass extinction events
Great video, teribble music especially with tht kick drum
this video is fantasy theory visualized to make a sell, God made earth in a day
Great video ❤
Kurzgesagt: In a coconut shell
Thank you for all the teams that involved in making this video. This has been a great journey to experience a brief moment of pure mind-blowing  of how ancient earth is.
Great video
You could probably do something similar with evolution, since that also takes quite a while for anything to visibly change and is similarly hard to grasp.  Or the journey out of the solar system, where the astronomical distance is the thing that is difficult to imagine. But that may be boring, as almost all of that video would cover literally nothing/emptiness.
I come back here from time to time. It is just such an amazing video. Hard to grasp that each second is still an unfathomable amount of time.
music at 20:00 slaps major
One of my favorite videos ever.
when I say that this is my go-to video for studying I'm not lying bc Ive watched this video like 20 times and I legti cannot get enough of it
Fantastic! We need a sequel: All of human history in one hour!
I'm just saying, this would go hard as a Geometry Dash level.
No matter how harsh the climate is, the occurence of lifeforms is inevitable  Never give up, no matter how tough the time gets. You will live and see the end of it. ❤❤❤❤
Wish he talked more about the Huronian Glaciation event. Since it’s not that well known, we don’t know whether it was a bunch of little ice ages, or one massive freeze much like the later Snowball Earth events of the Cryogenian period. It’s possible that there could’ve simply been massive ice sheets and icebergs all the way down to the equator, or that the entire planet would’ve resembled Hoth. Also the Great Oxygenation Event was among the first mass extinction events as well, since oxygen back then was a poison to most forms of life (including the Cyanobacteria which had no immunity to their byproducts) it killed en masse. This oxygen also broke down methane in the atmosphere, severely degrading most greenhouse gases and ultimately causing the Huronian Glaciation event.
Of all the Human content out there, I hope Aliens see this
Where did the rain come from in the eoarchean era if earth was just a lave hellscape?
Totally AI
Very well made video with excellent visuals and a musical score that perfectly matches each period! In particular, it is one of the best visual depictions of the Archean period that I have seen. A lot of artistic renderings of this period forget to include the “orange haze sky”, you didn’t forget to include it! That is of course a mysterious time with a lot of unknowns… the Archean “Purple Earth Hypothesis” is a fascinating theory as to why “green” is the dominant color for photosynthesis today…you could make a whole future video just about that!
For us North Americans… the Stenian Period is also when the Appalachian Mountains first started to form (Grenville Orogeny)
This is taking so long  I want to sleep
Thank you, I didn't know I needed this. It is really moving and impressive how small we are.
Young earth creationists are gonna hate this
OR -  the Jewish & Christians are right.  We confess to God that , "I'm not Holy, but You are",  and I spend eternity in Heaven.  What's your plan?
this feels numbingly inaccurate
Awesome!!!!!
29:43 i saw the glitch 😭😭😢
11:51 -  17:58 is my favorite part. It just feels good and calm and ..... great.
Can’t wait for something similar soon for all of the history of the universe
Cant wait until part 2 drops in 4.5 billion years!
What a channel, I love this 🥰 Happy 10th Birthday, a little late😅
Really wish I could enjoy this but the constant clock ticking added into the audio makes it impossible.
If only there was a way to turn off that horrible horrible dull music. This fantastic animation would be better of without it, sorry to say I had to stop watching 1 billion years into it.
It took you guys 5 years!?!? To make this masterpiece for free!?!? You deserve a lot of subs
Since necessarily the closer one gets to the present, the more things have survived from the past, any sufficiently long history necessarily requires changing time scales at certain points, otherwise you will have long periods where nothing interesting happens, and short periods where too much happens too quickly to follow. So, the typical way a video about a long history would be structured would be to change time scales at certain intervals to keep the level of detail consistent throughout.  The disadvantage of doing so however is that it becomes difficult to conceptualize how much time is passing when the scales keep changing, and things happening at different time scales get lost. By keeping one consistent timescale for the entire video, this demonstrates what is happening at a geological timescale even as things happen on shorter timescales. What was particularly interesting here is it allowed the video to focus on things that would otherwise be missed, in this case in particular what happened to the Earth between its formation 4.5 billion years ago and the Cambrian explosion 538 million years ago. This time period would otherwise be largely ignored or skimmed over in most histories.  I'm sure this was a difficult video to make and took a lot of time and resources, and I think it was mainly created to make that point. But even so, I do wish Kurzgesagt would do a follow up video, as there are sorter timescales that I think would also benefit from the same treatment.  I would love to see a one hour video starting with more recent events: *The Cambrian explosion 538 million years ago *The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago *The split of the Australopithecus genus 4.2 million years ago *The first anatomically modern human 315,000 years ago *Origins of agriculture in West Asia 10,000 BCE *Printing of the Gutenberg Bible in 1450 CE  Recently I've been particularly curious why when anatomically modern humans first evolved 315,000 years ago, what further advancements were required before the Neolithic Revolution could actually begin.
are dinosaurs real? cus there aint no dino in the bible
This video could also start with a simple, "Hi. You're on a rock floating in space. Pretty cool, huh?"
Holly, this video was amazing my nephew watched this in his earth science classroom ❤❤❤
99% of all the species that have ever lived on Earth have vanished; we will too—unfortunately by our own hands.
There is no 4.5b years, thats so unrealistic lol, theres a few thousand years since god created the earth
2019?????? Thats like 6 years dude
I think the human was on there a bit too long. According to most recent science, he shouldve only been on screen for about 0.4 seconds.  For that human to appear as long as he did, this video should be about 5 hours long.
NUT CAT               L O L  W H A T  I S  N U T  C À T
Ye this is cool                          L O L
Bro this has wasted 10 minutes of my life 4:36
thank you very much for making this video
An hour? Didn’t that one guy do it in 19 minutes or something?   But really, this is amazing. An hour of animation? And it’s just free on YouTube? Can’t tell you how lucky people are to have you teaching them, Kurzgesagt. Keep up the amazing work.
don't think i didn't see that weird thing (kind of resembles icthyosaur from half life) at 55:40
I GOT AN AD OMG
19:40 Gotta love when the Doom music kicks in.
멍청한 기독교는 이 영상을 싫어하겠지?
This album is an actual balm to my psyche when I have to do a step intensive task (like cooking) and I don't for whatever reason have my ADHD meds.
lil long slow but dang it’s good
44:46
Love the soundtrack 🔥
This also really puts into perspective just how much a billion is.
Steady i would like to share my concept of life i think we as living objects came to be since before our understanding of reality like i think we are either super organisms like mushrooms that came from asteroids hitting earth or we are frommed through amalgamation like the combination of elements.
Mesoarchean ost reminds me of Doom and I love it
I’d love it if a video like this could be made about human history. Though I imagine it would be very hard to make what with so many cultures all simultaneously doing interesting things.
28:52 if you payed attention to the shine on the water, you’d see that they come in and out of view to the rhythm.
5:15 “Wow, noice! *clicks tongue* hehehe
I just put this on the side every now and then, just to reflect how long the beginning is and how miniscule time we have been here. This is a hidden gem with only 13million views
Stop mark 25:07
@SPCv4 things aren’t free okay
This video has been my therapy since it released… love it.
Not to brag but I live on this planet
You didn't show period of gods..
Watching it in one sitting is amazing
My brother: how's the land sir? Me: barren just barren all there is just microbies 😑
Love ya ❤
Dig the music
11:57 Quoting my favorite Gaming Movie (Sturmgrenadier Planetside Recruitment Video) Man, will this Rain ever going to stop ?
They cooked so hard that it sent the Earth back to the hadean eon.
This is not 1 houre
Bro
1 hour
Oh no, So much climate change on earth and life survived but humans going bonkers 😂😂😂😂😂
Life is darn beautiful 🥲🥲
Cameraman of the... idk, forever?
i put yhis on to be background noise for my writing projects but i turned out watching the whole thing intently, only tuning out to write every couple minutes or so. and it sucked my attention right bacm after a couple sentences. truly amazing video.
ok, i can give some inffo abouyt this video
Love  it😊
wtf. This video is bullshit. techno music all over the place?  For a long time. Come on.
10:37 did i just see a meteorite get warped to nowhere?
Hadean= the floor is lava but it is 🔥INSANITY🔥 mode💀💀💀 chance to survive:0.1%
I like how the music is also at 60bpm to represents each 1.5mil years
The universe is so old, yet sooo young.
Just wanna say, I come back to this every now and then just to enjoy the soundtrack. Epic Mountain did an amazing job.
Respect for camera man
Well done sir 👌
I like :::
You mean 4.5 billion lies and BS in one hour...? xD
Idk why you guys picked so many different songs during the video.  You could have just used one TOOL song...
where did the billion years of rain come from??
i created an account just to like and comment this masterpiece
It's crazy to think about that we're all looking at our *common* ancestors in this video.
31:22 - 36:58 is probably my favorite section musically
Thinking about Sagan's cosmic calendar, we only have 26 "days" left until the Sun "swallows" the Earth... there could be some animation with this idea =)
‘Life finds a way’ nice Jurassic park reference there
Translate of portuguese language please 😢😢😢
DUDE THE MUSIC IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FLIPING GOOD.
“we are almost home” dam i love that distance and time, huh.
58:12 A nice little Jurassic Park reference during the Jurassic Period.  "Life uh finds a way"
This guy knows his audience well….. I tip my hat, smash the like button and double check im still subscribed with all notifications for you good sir.
Before it rained for millions of years, was the entire ocean sitting in the atmosphere?
that wasn't really in a nutshell 😂😂 .....thanks for this 🥂
I was here.
Skip 10 Seconds and you gonna skip 15 million years
> 45:00 into the video now > "the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens migh have invented sex" > prog music continues
Where do I go to support for a 10 hour video? I need to see at least 2.6 seconds of all human history from the emergence of Homo Sapiens to present day!
All of human history being a blink it or you miss is moment really puts things into perspective, eespecially when if it was 13,8 billion years in1 hour, earths history would only last about 1/3 of it, making human existence even less
Lovely!!!!
Someone got burnt their head for just someone said "This is free to watch" and then start to complaint. What's wrong with these people.
8:30 it starts raining but I am wondering where is this rain/water coming from? After being a very fiery planet, where did the water come from? how did it form a cloud and rain?
Wow what an amazing journey 🤩 I was putting my puzzle together while watching and listening to the soundtrack. It was great! Congratulations for this amazing project 💖
why does the Cretaceous look so beautiful 😮
IS THAT A GORGONOPSIAN
I've been here for a yoctosecond
Honestly one of my favorite videos on the internet
i am watching this on my trainride home after boarding school 😂
how short is human life? kurzgesagt:
The music reminds me a lot of the music from the SimCity series. I happen to like the soundtrack to that one so encouraged me to stick through to the end even with my AuDHD.   We will see if humans prove to be the dead end of the era of mammals going forward. Am kinda a glass half empty sort of person so that is my guess on what is going to actually happen. We will do ourselves in then some other dominant species might arise that is much more suitable for the ecosystem as a whole than we are. Maybe an intelligent bipedal insect or something. I have not heard of a time when insects were on top of the roost. Perhaps it might be their turn in the aftermath of us.
A wonderful journey, thank you.
1:36 In my living room allday everyday
imagine existing for millions of years and not even discovering fire couldnt be me
it´s beatiful!!!
Vandal Savage is part of the Kuzgesart team
Good shiiit
but i like the music
God created earth
Where is the water rain came from on the Eoarchean era then?? 🤔🤔
Huge props to the mograph designers on this one
1 year old. 7 million views. 30K comments. On a one hour evolution of Earth cartoon.. there is hope for humanity after all. Beautifully presented.
I watched this entire thing it was beautiful and brutal
I only came about to this video today, one year later. And I was completely mesmerized for the whole hour. Fantastic, that's all I can say. Special shout out to the team who made music for the video, such a good beat throughout. The message at the end is extremely powerful, and I hope people who need to hear it will. This planet is precious, and we need to do everything we can to preserve it. We do not own it and we do not claim right to it.
"I bopped hard to the Mesoarchean era of music" is not a sentence I could have ever imagined speaking, but here we are
Please is there audio track in some of your videos I only speak Arabic please respond fast
No humans yeah !!! 😂
Beautiful.  But WTAF, You Tube, with the scammy, semi-obscene boner ads? It's frankly insulting.
Well, let's see... first the Earth cooled, and then the dinosaurs came, but they all got too big and fat, so they all died, and turned into oil, and then the Arabs came, and they bought Mercedes Benzes
This is one of the most beautiful videos I've ever watched in my life
This is 10 minute video, repeating, repeating.
Such a master piece.
watch this for long enough and your other screen starts rolling to the right
But let's see what a 1,500,000x slow motion video looks like
This video is making me feel so thankful for just being here and alive but so sad we're on the way to make our species extinct and throw this gift away for which it took 4.5 billion years (or even more considering time before earth) to make.
Is this just “the entire history of the world, I guess” 2.0?
Who was the braindead in*est bred that used Sponsor Block to Block like 99% of this content?
This made me not believe in god even more✨
Thanks!
Phenomenal work. Better than 99% of the Netflix content. Congratulations ❤
Did I feel something watching this? Well yes. I felt this could heal the world actually.
I fucking love you
Hay kid? Want to play the floor is lava? Travels to 4500million years ago.
Bill Wurtz did it in 20 minutes
Prog rock masterpiece.
My god, Kurzgesagt, you guys are just awesome
History of the world, I guess, has gone quiet since this dropped
Those comets are really slow
Hey January 2025 here, you have to try against Deepseek
Loonitics! Please intelligently tell me how you could possibly come up with a number like that? You be ashamed of such mindless gobbly gook!
And yet, January 2025 seems to have lasted longer.
"Every human to ever exist existed here for a brief period on this wet rock in a void."
Interesting video but any explanation of how scientists know exactly what was taking place billions of years ago?
59:59 can someone tell me the name of the music that’s playing?
Amazing ❤
All of this just so i have to pay taxes.   I dont think we will ever create life on another planet. Not that we would literally ever be aware of. I think it could happen, but one singular person cannot create enough physical change. This is beyond lifetimes, this is something else entirely. Natural reactions caused by natural forces. I dont think any of our nearby planets cores couldn't handle this change after so long, but maybe thats also just something that gets adapted to. The right kind of chemical is released into the right kind of environment. Where nonliving environment exists and *something* exists within that environment to adapt to it. We adapted with eating and reproduction and thats pretty neat. I wonder what "aliens" might emerge, their unique adaptations and evolotion.
Music in order if you want it ig bc i wanted it lol (all are from Epic Mountain)  The Floor Is Lava Rain Sediments Submarine Time Machine Ur My Crush Rain Mountains Submarine Time Machine Dino Discovery Behind The Lies (credits)
Now, this is what i want to learn. Not the rubbush lies like this clip and what the lying scientists reckon..
300 milion years of just rain😮
Ragebait theists
I wish they create a remastered version where he talks through out the whole video discussing facts and cool information about the current period the earths in
You should try to do one on human history next, if you can.
Coming back every time for the amazing music and animations, keep it going guys!
imagine if this got exactly 4.5 billion views
Erm, how did mammals emerge if an asteroid wiped all dinosaurs?
Absolutely mindblowing piece of work.
Woooooow 🤩 Thaaaaank youhuuuuuuuuuuu 🫶😄
it's just that after learning engineering for one hour while watching  this makes me fill that what i do is impactfull
😃😍🙏🙏🙏
Geography??? 🌏🌏😕
I hope one day you will drop Aphex Twin remake of this video with his original music.
At first I was going to say, wait, I thought it was stromatolites that made the oxygen, not cyano— Then I was doh! And just what are the stromatolites made of?
This as an actual dance set at a festival would be nutty
35:32 is that TMNT music?
Bill wurtz did it better
Nonsense. Please..you all need to read your bible you have nothing to lose
A lot has already been told about the video! But I still want to put my chunk of appreciation here. Especially the music! My goodness lord! Insane!   To infinity and beyond Kurzgesagt!
insanely great idea
I use this to listen to something while doing homework and other things
Brilliant video.
“It is much hot and comfy”? AI. S/b “very”
Taylor swift got nothing on Earth's eras
Bill wurtz did it already. And with cooler jingles
Our planet Earth has shown how amazing it really is with these changes for millions of years, from molten lava hell to habitual paradise teaming with life!🎉😱😭
Soubhan Allah, thank you so much for all your work this is surely the best video I've ever seen, I watched it all in one shot and I still have so much questions, still I'm very grateful for all your hard work and efforts.
I don't understand what means "comfy" at 7:21
i'm simply astonished at the brilliance, skill, expertise and dedication behind this video. thank you so so much for sharing.
if theres no water in 3999 and it starts raining where did the water cycle come from.
I really love your videos that fact that the universe is amazing ❤
This was the ultimate video ive ever seen. Best way to wind down after work. The ost is incredible. And like always you guys do the most amazing work. Thanks for this.
a huuge thank u
was going to hit the ellipsis to click "Not Interested" but I thought I would let you know in the comment section first
👍
great video
Hi can u tell me how u animate like that
3 am moments
Hey Guys my name is Candace.  Candace O. Please don't be brainwashed by this video.  God created us humans "insert random bible quote".   Also, dinosaurs aren't real.   Okay, bye...
1:00:39 the last transition
This really puts things into perspective... incredible vid
It was a really cool video 😄
Thank you! I didn't want to leave my house to run my errands today until the video was over! Amazing job, thank you.
4.5 billion is a lot. Now at least about 13.5 million of the 7 or so billion people on earth today have some idea of just how brief a time their kind has been around. Thank you for taking the time to illustrate this!
please can we have a version where the narrator talks less? i love to use this video as background while i study but the narrator talking disturbs me and i can't concentrate properly
✨🎶🧘‍♂🎶✨
Where did the rain come from in the beginning? No water vapour to form clouds would mean no rain. Also, water is H20, no oxygen in the atmosphere, would mean no water, right?
fascinating huh
Thank you for this. You realigned my perspective.
This video is genius and easily the best Kurzgesagt video.
Awesome
facebook doesn't allow me to share this with a preview image, wtf??
I feel….like my “problems” are really sooooo unimportant. We are miracles!
this was awesome! thanks for not putting it behind a paywall
I think that this is amazing but to make it better you could add the landmasses and continental drift in the top left corner
53:48  والكمبري بنقشره والارض عليها نباتات س س سيلوري اسماك واتعرت قالت دفوني واتغطت ف العصر البرمي
OH NO I BLINKED
i really love your video and your posters at the end, i will buy them all because i love knowledge
It must have been made in half hour or less
I'm more or less halfway through the video and still no shit has happened😢
Imagine the christian version of this. The whole video would have been a single frame.
this music so fire
I guess it's safe to say 4.5 billions year's old 😂 since I've seen it all
20:13 Tool?
put this on 1.75 speed and the music goes hard
Do not let the history teacher see this they would play this in class no matter what😭
Thanks for the insights! Just a quick question: I have a safepal wallet with USDT, and I have the 12word phrase: ( proof inner hobby bounce blouse able donate virtual luggage cart morning ticket ). How can I send it to Binance?
I appreciate your effort in animating this entire watch. However, the truth is that the video has a massive lack of information. I thought it would be fun as always, but it turns out you gave up on providing information and settled for animation. Again, I really appreciate it, but I thought you wouldn't complete only half of the way. Thanks for your efforts, guys.
When will these individual cells start to make this video.
What an amazing accident created us
Next: Do the catalogue of life and how every living things branch out
42:20 that theme hit
I downloaded this and put it into a folder in Signal Simulator. Now i can watch it in a virtual screen while looking for aliens.
Bro this is even better than lofi girl
I just realise how beautiful life can be sometimes I listened it while learning and playing Minecraft
🔥
Wow
Could anyone please tell what is the song name started from the Cretaceous? it is so nostalgic
One error I think I noticed but it seems you mixed up eukaryotes and fungi. Fungi-like life emerged during the Proterozoic Eon while eukaryotes emerged during the Calymmian.
Great work, thank you
Fantastic work by all concerned! 👏👏👏👏👏
Bill wurtz did it in 15 minutes
Absolutely spectacular!
Ðis is one of ðe most rewatchable videos i've seen.
29:43 glitch
im watching this at 3am, fk my health i gained knowledges.
For science nerds like myself this was beautiful and amazing thank you so much
3:48 Nobody told me there’d be jumpscares lol
Almost as if a GOD designed and organized this masterpiece we call LIFE ❤
This is just an excuse to flex Epic Mountain's epic music
Lovely ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The musics were great. Especislly hadean and rhyacian 😂
3:50 hell yeah
ABSOLUTE CINEMA.
0:49 if this were true, we should expect to see the materials on/in the moon would be similar to earth's. That isnt what we see tho, the moon had more rare metals than eath. Collisions rarly happen between plant sized objects in space.
I like how over time for the hedean period you see slightly bigger an bigger rocks form
Vibing with the music for real for real.
Possibly my favourite video on youtube
How is it posible for life to stay same for so long and then in few Million years it evolved in so many creatures
8:50 how did it begin to rain? If everything was covered with fire
guys don't forget to hit the like button for this amount of effort!
All of history cuz yea you were there…
1:36 THE FLOOR IS LAVA 🗣🔥🗣🔥
worlds fastest and longest timelapse ever!!
plain lies
Respect to Thomas Veith and Fabian Glaser that made the music :)
The Paleogene era music made me tear up for some reason, and when he said "we are almost home", I just started crying :(.  It was so moving and powerful it gave me chills (the good ones) Who knew one hour of this music. One hour of the beautiful scenes. All of it just changed my perspective
I really did feel something. This music made me feel grateful that earth is our home. This blue planet is truly amazing, and so rich with perspective changing history. It changed the way I saw things about our beautiful home. You guys must have spent sooo long on this. CONGRATS
This video either cures or causes my depression. It's a 50:50 tie.
It took earth all this time to develop and be a beautiful piece of art just for humans to slowly destroying it.
So good ngl
De dónde,  y por qué,  apareció tanta lluvia de agua??!!
Poe qué,  de repente,  comenzó a llover, y se forman los océanos?! QUÉ FUE lo que cambió?
Por qué habían tantos cuerpos que colisionaban con la tierra primigenia?!... de dónde venían?!
O... por qué los cuerpos que colisionanan con la tierra primigenia tenían colas de cometas, si no había atmósfera??!!... O SÍ, había atmósfera??!!
... cuál era la temperatura  sobre la superficie?!!?... composición?!!? Qué había debajo de la superficie?!...
O... la distancia al sol siempre era la misma?!... por qué sólo se muestra en perspectiva a la luna, y por ejemplo,  no se muestran respecto al resto de los planetas del sistema solar?!... ES UNA LÁSTIMA QUE TAN HERMOSO VIDEOno se explique más detalles... pues se pierde interés por ver durante tanto tiempo las mismas cosas...
O también,  por qué había lava, y esta duró  tanto tiempo ...
Podrías explicar más cosas😂mientras avanza el video... pues queda mucho espacio vacío,  y muchas cosas que se muestran no se entienden... x ejemplo por qué la luna primigenia se va alejando de la tierra,  si es que era más masiva y, en consecuencia,  habría más atracción gravitatoria... ??!!
Bueno 🎉... pero, podría explicar un poco más... X ejemplo,  por qué tantos cuerpos colisionaban al principio,  ni bien se formó la tierra... Era porque la tierra no estaba protegida por la gravedad de júpiter ??!!... sería muy interesante si pudieran agregar al menos información básica sobre más cosas que se muestran en el vídeo... pues quedan aún espacios vacíos,  sin explicación...  GRACIAS IGUALMENTE 🎉
He said that first life may developed from hot minerals then he said, WE DO NOT KNOW 😂  of course you don’t know neither of all scientists, they can’t make most simple shapes of life with all technology they have 🤣🤣🤣  STOP BRAINWASHING THE PEOPLE
Yo those soundtracks in the background 😩👌
I'm letting this play while I study for biology.
you guys gonna do like a 13 billion year in 2 hours right?
The music completely ruined the video
bill wurtz did it faster
Stop mark  11:20
Kinda like driving from LA to Vegas-then hitting one of those desert downpours-then Vegas, Baby!(I really enjoyed the video too)
Tell me your ways and animations pls how is it so smooth! Keep the work up!!
I hate your English accent...spit on you
Best video ever from Kurxgesagt, Why ? Much hot and comfy ! LOL !  Anyway IN THE Cryogenian life survived because ice allowed sunlight to reach plant and/or other bacteria trapped in the ice or below it. Allowing very slow reproduction and photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2. However the O2 would be trapped in the ice or liquid below the ice.
Music = “Give me futuristic, chill, but not unbearable to listen to for an hour”   ✅
Genius production 🎉
in this insane lore of earth we were basically born yesterday
4.5 Billions of years to form and us humans will only take hundreds of years to destroy it. We need help
Wow❤
I'm so touched 🥲....i can't believe i just traveled 4.5billion years in a go. This is quite intriguing 🎉⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
It was a long long time ago. I can grasp that.
This would not be that if it was true or I might be😅 it's kinda weird to think hb
man... how long did this take
In the beginning god created the heavens and the earth.
Forms the moon? What about ancient writings that talk about the time before the moon????
Congratulations, this was the best earth historical timeline ive ever actually bothered to care about. Well done everyone involved 🎉🎉
I'm barely in the hadean and this is already the coolest thing I've ever seen
This videos is not about learning what happened, it is about for how long nothing happened.
alright u win i dont wanna be immortal anymore
Where can I get that soundtrack?!
Okay first the music in this slaps. Second the animation is awesome. And then lastly this is incredible! I've watched this so many times and I've put it on to fall asleep to. It's great when you're paying attention and it's also great when you're falling asleep.Sweet dreams of our existence here i come.
“It is our time now, we are almost home…” hits me every time, I literally cried
false products.
what is cecis?
All based on theories, but we as humans can't fathomably understand how old the earth is because simply we don't have a time machine, and tbh I don't think anyone would wanna travel back that far lol
Watching this video makes you curious about everything. A very good, informative video, indeed!
should have to show this video in its entirety to every major polluter in the world
Thank you so much for this
Everything our beautiful planet has been through and so many challenges it has faced - it is truly a miracle that we are here 🥲 I wish the world leaders would see this video and understand how lucky they are to be here. Maybe then they would stop allowing the destruction of our home, our only home! 🌎
55:50. finally got to the "THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER!" part.
Best Youtube video ever!
“If you laugh you got to hell” 2:43 :my home after watching the vid
Interesting concept, but impossible to listen to due to the ear piercing soundtrack. What a shame.
44:55 Algae sex hell yeah
The last second made me tear up a little. Life is so short.
Cool video! But i wonder why you didn't include the formation of the banded iron formations? The entire ocean being read for millions of years seems like a pretty cool detail to leave out. Someone correct me if there has been any new discoveries of that not being the case.
the camera man's goated
that progressive house music is actually really good for this video
So sad dinosaur!
Looking at this before the end of the year to feel life of the others:(
Bro Earth was just chilling for so long and then complex life started showing up, thinking they own the place.
The end of 2024 is coming. Time to revisit how everything began so long ago.
love this vid
So boring to see this video but it's very interesive
I absolutely love your art style man ❤
Poor cameraman he was alive for 4.5 billion years rip he was probably recording even though he died and this channel decided to stop the vid and make it 1 hour so it took way to long and upload it on this channel the person did most of this work
I watch at 2X speed for the beginning
We told you to stop scrolling
just wow, truly mammoth effort!
unfortunatly the products are very expensive to purchase here in south america :(
How have i found this just now
You know the animation’s good when you get mesmerised by it
waste of time
thank you kurzgesagt
Crazy...
Loved this video!! What a great job you did!!
They brought in Mick Gordon (DOOM soundtrack guy) for 19:40 onwards LMAO
Mdma
I am about 42 mikroseconds old now.
Only 4.5 billion years to go till the earth dies.
Are we there yet?  Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
"And even after all this time, we still only have single cell organisms" come on man, they're trying.
This • is • the • most • amazing • video • I • have • ever • watched • EVER! Well done, Kurzgesagt!
I was genuinely just gonna watch this as a video and still didn’t think it would actually be a background video 🥲
Pro tip: Keep closed captions on, and you can skip without worrying about missing anything.
PLEASE do this for other planets, or is that too much effort?
1 second = 1,000,000 years Even human homo-sapiens have survived just 300,000 years J̌ust 0.3 second We are just nothing more than a blink
bullsh**
How do scientists know this happened
This life is insanely short compared to the eternity we'll see in Heaven. Jesus, the Son of God, died for our sins. He was crucified, then resurrected on the third day. With His sacrifice, we can live forever in Heaven with Him!   Thousands of years from now in Heaven, you won't even remember the concept of money, pain, or suffering. Repent, follow Jesus, and see Heaven!  - If you want to learn more about Jesus and Heaven, read one, or all, of the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John within the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each book serves as an eyewitness account of the miracles He performed, His sacrifice, and His promise to you!
Wow!!!
❤
I hope that this video will still be up for another 1000billion years.
This is a masterpiece....
The animation, voice over, and info are great but can we talk about the banger music playing in the background lol
A movie
The earth is only 6,000 years old. Scientists have weak ‘theories’ and fake ‘evidence’ that ‘support’ the idea that earth is more than 40,000 years old.
3:50 unexpected beat drop
Ive prolly watched this over a dozen times! Such a great animation! Love you guys!
Imagine you're watching this while eating the cotton candy jar you just got for Christmas
That was one of the best videos I've ever seen. Thanks for the hard work! One more thing: at the end of the video you said ‘Hope you felt something watching this.’ And some parts of the video almost took my breath away and I had tears in my eyes. Just thinking about how long our planet has existed without us or that the largest crater on Earth is already 2.2 billion years old. That is incredibly exciting.
I slept through a few millions of years, sorry
wow this is so amazing
Piece of art ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
51:11 thats was SO COOL
I would pay to be able to download the video (but I'm poor)
Best video on YouTube
This was very good i learned new things but wheres 5 billion years ago
Go even further my dude
Now I know the true history of The Earth. I can flex.
Komisch.. bin mit diesem Video aufgewacht 😂😂
Dear Birds:  Thank you for the video.  Beautiful anime, music, words, voice, etc.  Thank you and best regards and Merry Christmas!
LATE!: I love this the fact that this is free is absolutely crazy!
this video is actually a masterpiece
this is peak cinema

At 45:00 Turn On Subtitles/CC In English 💀💀

So wooly mammoth & megaladon didn't exist??
Damn, we have done a lot for the time we've had. I guess having a species where everyone is stressed about everything all the time does have results.  In all realness. I think language is the catalyst. Being able to pass on complex information to your offspring is just broken. It is basically cheating. We are just giving out test copies to everyone. It's even illegal to not give them to your children. Homocheaters man
I can't believe i watched full video without being bored This video is best ✨✨✨
Feel*
Amazing man my respect for all the kurzgesagt cast will never wane and the fact that relative to this video I’ve been alive for less that a nanosecond (I’m 12)and it’s just mind boggling that the world existed for so long before us humans and our lives fell less that puny in front of all of history.
19:41 IS THAT DOOM ETERNAL MOTIF
Thank you algae Bangiomorpha pubescens 🙏😔 (45:00)
If I were a teacher
Oh Uh
can u make one with history
Put this animation in I.A Portuguese Brasil Translate to us!!
in my opinion, this is literally the best video i have ever watched. i cant stop watching this :D ive watched ur channel for years, and like its rlly cool, i like the animation style!! keep of the good work Kurzgesagt!  btw i love this part 58:47 bcuz everything looks so pretty.. i miss everything we had back then :[
59:50 nah bro that asteroid was a blessing. Those dinosaurs were boring jerks. Humans and mammals FTW!!!
Amazing animation and product 👏🏻 ❤️
It's insane how it took this long for us to get to where we are right now. This video really puts all of history into perspective and it shows how little time we've been here for and we still have a long way to go.
your truly amazing 😊
Bro, the dinos was only 66 seconds of this video!
34:02 2024 million years ago!
Just imagine if it was 1 hour in 4.5 billion years.
This was profound. Thank you. 😊
It’s like ai
"earth freezes over again" "sure why not" wtf without mentioning the few theoretical reasons? Just why not. Stupid comments. All. Same about first water.
Missing a lot of text/voice information
this things were not mentioned in the bible!
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
I still can't imagine how amazing these videos are.
I'm watching this after taking my final Exam
1:36 "the floor is lava" literally
The soundtrack sounds very much like Tool. Nice.
I love this
I know that, by this standard, I'm hundreds of billions of years late to the party, but this is truly incredible and one of the greatest YouTube videos of all time.  Education meets real art.  The soundtrack is a jam, the animation is so smooth, the narration is clean and seamlessly fits in, and the effort to coordinate all of this and create this masterpiece is nothing less than Herculean.  MASSIVE respect to the Kurzgesagt team.  I've been a major fan for the better part of a decade, but you've solidified yourselves as certified LEGENDS with this one.  Dropping this video for free was probably lunacy, but thank you so much for that!
Thanks, algae Bangiomorpha pubescens!
props to the cameraman for filming for 4 billion years
Those mesoarchean riffs are gnarly
19:12 Venus
I literally love this video so much it is the best thing ever created and posted on YouTube ever in all our planet's history.
Why tf do I feel nostalgia watching this???
One map in the end i saw greenland as the same size of Africa but greenland is 14 TIMES smaller than africa so pls change it

This viedeo is already year out of date can we get an update?
8:30 earth is cooking
Thank God 🙏
To me this is the best history-lesson ever made. Everyone should see it.
Props to people who watched this whole thing 🫡
Im very puzzled by the names of the different phases I mean who comes up with these names it feels like made difficult on purpose 😅
You want me to believe you didn't use the ai???
it glitches a little bit at 29:43
3:50 OMG THAT BASS DROP, SLAY HADEAN PERIOD
47:30 i never got to see 1 billion to 999 million😢
Came for the knowledge, stayed for the Beats
I just watched this entire video regular speed no skippage at 3:00 a.m.
Love the enthusiasm, but the earth is not this old. Biblically, just a bit over 6,000 years. Jesus loves us and his life proves this. Noah's life. Adam and Eve' life. Be vigilant and aware of the truth for God does not want us to perish. Good Bless. Christ is king.
How could they find out all of this information when they dont even live a single day at these era😦
How did the water form if we didn’t have oxygen till Siderian?
to think all of this happened before we all existed is crazy
WTF did you start working on this video in 2019? It took 4 years to finish an hour-long video💀☠
Really interesting. But where did the rain come from? One theory is that the water or the elements of it came with meteors.
1:14 this is why I say the moon is made out of "Cheese"
Woah, whenever there is a long video I usually go off of it within minutes, but somehow you made me stay. I watched the whole thing, and it’s insane how you’ve worked for probably years to make one video and that really paid off. Thanks a lot for making this video, I understand the earths history so much more than I did before watching this
Crazy! What a ride.
Such an amazing video
bill wurtz got competition
666k thousand likes  😈
True! All of this really happened. I witnessed all of it! Totally true! 🤝🏻🗿
"Microbes have invented SEX" Kurzgezagt-
how did it rain on a hot sroching planet coverd in lava? how did water even came to existance?
Let it cook, for the eyes.
It is insane that the Cretaceous period was 70 million years long but its a minute in this video
This is such a great n wonderful animation. Thankyou for ur hardwork
how come the moon didnt have these transformations and remains the same
I have to appreciate the transformation in each timestamps, like Paleoarchean just from dry rocky land to pure water with rocks
This is one of the coolest videos I’ve seen
It’s honestly astonishing and mind-boggling to think that on this scale human history doesn’t start until the last 10 milliseconds (0.01 seconds) of the video. We as humans take up an unimaginably short portion of the the lifespan of the earth from beginning to now only about 3/10000ths of a percent or 0.0003%
I hope it's okay with the channel, but I downloaded this because it's so cool, and I love playing it in the background while I'm cleaning or cooking or something
I'm 50 minuts in the video and still no visible animals 😱 impressiv inteligent life as we see today still is in a early stages of the timeline. There are still a change for some animals to evoule to bee as smart as humans.
أَأَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ السَّمَاءُ ۚ بَنَاهَا (27) رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا (28) وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا (29) وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا (30) أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَاءَهَا وَمَرْعَاهَا (31) وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَاهَا (32) مَتَاعًا لَّكُمْ وَلِأَنْعَامِكُمْ
27:31 micro-organisms desided, M.O.G stands for micro-organisms  M.O.G 1, you know what would be a great idea? M.O.G 2, what M.O.G 1, what if we evolve 🤯 M.O.G 2, yes, yes, let's evolve M.O.G 2, how did you get the idea to evolve if you're just a single cell? M.O.G 1, I don't know, we'll make up a story as we go along 😂
8:40 where does the clouds come from to make rain, i mean the planet is still basically lava? 🤔
I just want to know, how do people know all of this? Were they there, where's the evidence? Are people just guessing like a theory, 😱 Conspiracy theorists. Now I'm not talking about the Dinosaurs and all of that, I'm talking about how the earth formed, were anyone there? I'm not being disrespectful to anyone, and good job on the animators of this video, but just think about it, how does anyone even know all of this? 🤔🤔
Fun video!! The music on its own is incredible 😃
Um ok this soundtrack tho 😮‍💨
love your content !
Don’t waste your time and watching this the reality is everything  created by الله our God and there is nothing else.
You are one of my most favorite channels. I love you all!
does anyone know what the moon looked like during the mesoarchean?
Props to the music composer;  the first tune felt like a royalty-free Nils Frahm track. And I mean that in the best way possible.
Well, Muslims already know how earth was created.....
Most of Earths natural history was at the subcellular level as biochemistry and genetics for billions of years. A new book published by Austin Macauley Publishers titled From Chemistry to Life on Earth outlines abiogenesis in great detail with a solution to the evolution of the genetic code and the ribosome as well as the cell in general using 290 references, 50 illustrations and several information tables with a proposed molecular natural selection formula with a worked example for ATP. Cheap as an e book. Without those developments multicellularity would have been impossible.
This actually shows how new we are on gargantuan timescale
best video ive ever came across with. congrats
45:04 WHAT DID THEY MEAN BY THAT 😭
watched this while drunk, i reccoment fell asleep at Hadean
ROKU NOOOOOOO
INSANE, the CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION  only happens IN THE LAST 10 MINS
This illustrates, to me how, as arrogantly and self absorbed and wreckless as humans have behaved, particularly during the last 100 years regarding stewardship of this planet and the limited time (based on past extinction level events)that we have before another life ending event inevitibly happens, we are but a blink of an eye of earths history and the earth, in its many eras will be here long after our time us up here. Unless, we find a way to live off planet...and even then, if the numbers arent significant and locations diverse, we are still headed for extinction. And thats the best case scenario where we dont doom ourselves by making earth uninhabitable. Greed, selfishness and arrogance. That is our legacy unless something changes and soon.
I wonder where it goes wrong & we are here !
Sooo good! Like this is a proper nerd rave party!
i am studying under the sound thx man
amazing
The music alone is absolutely amazing. I have had this video in my "watch later" for a very long time but it was worth waiting until I could watch it all in one go without any distractions. An almost meditative experience.
Put in 1.5X speed for techno rave…
The stromatolites glitched at 29:39
what do you mean this is already a year old
Earth is  indescribable
Thank you for the video, it's really impressive!
Anomalocaris on: 53:39
god creat the earth sile
10:12 how does it rain when there is no evaporation yet ?💀
Lovely video! And so different from your other videos, but yet great! Laughed out loud when:  and then came an asteroid and killed almost all the dinosaurs and other creatures. "What a  bummer" 😂
45:00 Bangiomorphia pubescens? Heh.
Aside from everything else, the soundtrack to this is outstanding! The section that starts during the Ediacaran era is my favourite. TUUNE!
Is this a theory or facts?
1:00:28 tht animal has a head bigger than its body
who saw dunkleosteus👇
Climate change deniers: “the climate has always changed” Kurzgesagt: “blink and you’ll miss all of human history” Yeah climate has always changed, but this video helps you appreciate it’s changing at an astoundingly absurd rate
Honestly I came for the music 😅
this is such a vibe
Pov you accidentally skipped 10 seconds and you missed 18 million years
Banger
29:43 found a bug lol
This was so otherworldly to watch🤩 zero skips
Shout out the music artists for the sweet beats to make this a really neat video to chill out to.
I would love to see a version of this that has no background music. Just the sound of the falling asteroids, boiling lava, etc.. 😊
how much animator got paid for this 1 video
this video is amazing it really like "wow me"
All i watch is YouTube. Because we have stuff like this
intersting😍
sound and visual accompaniment... it's a piece of art.
And to think this all came from "nothing". Not a chance
now i feel old
It's been a year and I think I play this at least twice a week while I'm working or relaxing. Peak replay-value.
This is a great video before bed
Why did it start raining? How do we know that it did?
What's the name of the music at 58:40?
Lol it will never cease to amuse me the tone Steve Taylor uses to say "might have invented sex"
*animates hour+ long video expecting people to listen to it in the background*
Past back to life 😅
big shoot out fo bangiomorpha things
I'm coming back to this video for the fourth time. I cry every time.  I hope that every person that worked on this video knows that they have created art.  And not just pretty art but powerful art that influences the viewer to feel and think so much bigger than our average life. It is educational and philosophical while barely using words. Thank you all so much.  Thank you.
Heroes of our time. I will remember you kurzesagt team. You have left your mark.
They sound send this to space in a usb or something for aliens to understand lore of earth
the video seems to last about 4.5B....
this is honestly a video i feel EVERYONE should watch in full, no skipping. The fact that lifeforms we can finally SEE didn’t even show up until around 10 minutes from the end is just incredible!! Like so many other comments said, this is such an incredible visual explanation of the whole of our planets history and how new to the planet life actually is. Just an all around awe-inspiring video, we can all read about how old the Earth is, but actually seeing it this way makes it so much easier to grasp the timescale that’s much larger than we can comprehend in our own minds. Fantastic video!!
lol Earth was distracted thinkin about stuff, just vibin it’s way thru space and then finally checked back in and noticed all the insane shit the Cambrian started to make and was like “wow now boys, let’s try that one more time” 😂 BAM! Went back to vibin around thru space, checked back in about 100 millions years later, was throughly disappointed once again with the Odovician results and was like “ugh… look guys you’re not getting the vision, it’s best we part ways” WACK! Late Devonian 120 million years later, Earth - “Surely they’ve got it together by now… damn it come on!!” SLAM! Permian 100 million years later, Earth - “Okay this has to be…sigh..” BOOM! Triassic 50 million years later, Earth “…I can’t leave for one second without having everything go to shit” FLING! Cretaceous 135 million years later, Earth “okay enough, i’ve given you plenty of time, I can’t deal with this nonsense anymore... Dinosaurs??? What the hell happened?! I’m fully taking over the management, gtfo” SMASH!
If they made every second of this video 100 years, it would last 12,500 hours or about a year and a half to watch
Not to brag but I live there
Wow this is amazing
Versus my favourite history video I mean today is it kind of boring at BC times was the world so cool
This took so much work that he was working on it for years and the fact that we got this so cool vid for free
Who else plays this in the background for study/work music?
imagine after millions of years , a new kinds study about humans like we are doing with dinos
this is cool and, but just vibin to these jams
@dhaba how do scientists know that asteroids hit earth for those many years? Could somebody explain!!
And now im smarter than my history teacher
This looks like it took 4.5 billion years to animate
This highlights a common issue with EDM today, waiting million of years for the beat drop! 🤣
59:38   "Such a paradise, like is thriving, nothing can go wrong. Wait whats that?! And an astrod killed the dinosaurs and most species on earth 😊 such a bummer."
We should rent out the las vegas sphere and play this, inside the sphere this video will play and outside you can show the whole earth changing..
oh hey! a dinosaurs ...  This had me
I just can't imagine how much time this video must've cost, even though 3 million years are completed every 2 seconds!
Those with short attention spans can skip the first 25 minutes of the earth being super hot, cooled, and rained on with little content presented before life starts. I figure this video is mostly clickbait for advertising. Watch this endless scrolling animation as a melatonin replacement.
How about you do future evolution
We got an hour long kg vid before gta 6.😅
Glory to God for ordering all things! And great job with the video.
This is like time travel, love it
This is one of the best, possibly THE best thing that has ever been uploaded to YouTube. And for free as well? You guys are raising the bar high! No idea why this didn't got recommended by YT earlier.
Amo este video. Es el mejor video que he visto en mi vida. Es el mejor video del mundo.
Where the lava come to foams?
Bro this would be the best pc background video if only i had youtube premium to download the video😢
huge respect for cameraman
2:09 why does it take asteroids 5 million years to reach the earth’s ground
Props to the cameraman
This is beautiful <3
This is a great video ! Thanks !!!  56:27 my favorite insect : Meganeura, and I was expecting to find it in this video….it was soooo good to see it.
the effort was worth it
there is a mistake in eoarchan era.
4.2 billion years of yt ads
Soooooo cool!!!
more music then info. wishing it was packed into a 10 min video. waste of time
subscribe to this guy bro worked for this for 4 years...
Bro u could just skip the boring part and increase  time for important stuff
Geometry Dash vives
Waa waiting for those few minutes that the dinosaurs appeared.
Le Me covering all the syllabus one night before my history exam
It blows my mind…all of that so I can sit on my couch watching YouTube videos.  I really believe if all people on this planet would stop and really think about how astonishing it is that we are here experiencing life, everyone would chill out and actually appreciate each other.
IM BLOWN AWAY BY THİS!!!! WTF KURZGESAGT!!?? Also Tuğçe Yazıcıoğlu? A turk is working there!!?? Thats amazing! I'll be listening to this whener Im studying for class
Ok, the music during mesoarchean went so hard, i was ready to dance or fight !! *on a cellular level*
This was so awesome!
53:27 Purple garlic 😂
LOVE THIS VIDEO...  @kurzgesagt you mentioned the largest verified impact structure on earth, but what about the earliest? Yarrabubba!
Earth, but make it prog rock
I can't wait for a video about ancient human history!
1hr of kurzgesagat is insane
im gonna give you a 90 millions year standing ovation👋👋👋
Well, i skipped billions of year 😢
Hey you Are you gonna do the humans To the past and the future
The animation seems 'Tank Stars' has launched a long  teaser
لماذا لم تضمّن ترجمة بالعربية؟
I normally wouldn't watch this video for too long but the music got me hook up
I have a suggestion for a second version of this video with a dashboard in left or right of the video with data information comparison of that period of time with nowadays data. Data like Average temperature of the planet, amount of oxygen and CO(2) in atmosphere, temperature of ocean,  amount of rain, percentage of forest and deserts, lenght of day, lenght of year and whatever parameter that has affected earth significantely. we may get an idea how climate change can affect again our planet.
Imma show this to any creationist whenever possible.
I enjoyed the music more than the video. 😊
Pleade add the audio track❤
Best science channel ever, putting this much effort is incredible, and it's free too
Great great video!!!
Hello sir you upload video in hindi but that sound like an ai voice can you upload this video from real hindi voice
wow
lets play floor is lava
Thank you😭 i love you kurzgesagt😭
How do we know this is what happened billions of years ago and how the earth looked like?
This music is awesome.
Good to watch while carrying on with other things , go explain that to AI !!
RELAXING !!
I think the Earth was a very steamy planet early in its evolution !!
45:00 they invented what?
carnian pluvial event is missing
Huge thanks to Kurzgesagt for giving us all this content for free
only god
Sound effects and music are also amazing. What a piece of art. Thank you, kurzgesagt.
LIKE THE VIDEO 📸
How sad. If only this video was made 200 years ago, it would be a perfect 1 hour  Edit: ops, my math wasn't mathing property. But im to lazy to fix it.
Idk bout you all but I am just vibing to the music
1 sec = 1,250,000 years 🥶  Thank me later

Anyone else notice the geometry dash motif?
Where is bhagat singh and maharana pratap??
Bill wertz: ok.
Bro be speaking the whole fnaf lore 💀
I’ve just discovered this and it’s awesome. Top top work.
I’ve just discovered this and it’s awesome. Top top work.
Hey, any science people out there. That "self sustaining nuclear reactor" that gets formed in the Statherian period. The one mentioned at the 37:00 mark. What happened to that?
imagine waiting 4.4 billions years to see life and soon an asteroid hit
Phenomenal commendable excellent job ❤❤

Hitting the like button took 500,000 years😂
God made his creation within 7 days. When he said let there be light, time must be different in  the heavens, just like in the movie Lucifer. It must've been eons for regular Earth days ??but so much faster in His. I think God made the world with Science. Science does not  contradict with God.  Even Human Anatomy is present so we are educated how to take care of our body, alongside with all the world's different branches of Science.
58:13 was that a reference to Jurassic world?
Loved this project. "It took forever to make." I see what you did there
Coming back to this, I wish they'll also do the same thing with further ahead in history like the stone age, bronze age etc.
34:32 bookmark
33:00 bookmark
8:29 there is undisputed fossil evidence of life during the mesohadean
Crazy!
one of the best videos i watched so far
wishing everyone who watches this video good luck
0:50 BOO! THEIA JUMPSCARE! (put at 0.25 speed if you wanna see this poor planet)
I felt what it was like to read from my encyclopedias with excitement and wonder when I was a child I want to go back to that
Why do we want to live so badly
24:40 you're so right mr Kurzgesagt colonizers are bacteria
52:19 gondwana before pangea?
MINIONS! TONIGHT WE STEAL THE M- moon..? 5:30
Sex was invented 45:04
LIES
I don't know why you didn't fill in he empty time with facts...Pretty gimmicky
I believe Theia and Pheaton existed who's with me?
If I were a teacher, I'd devote an entire class period to this. Have students watch without any grade being in the question, with the option to take notes. This is really awesome.
Just watch the intro of the big bang theory for the rest
39:54 is that a spit take i heard?
One thing is certain.  The Sultan of Oman lives in Zanzibar now.
idk who made the music for this but they're a god. dear lord this is insane. i need a whole album of this to work to
i regret not watching this video when it was first recommended to me. not even 3min and i can tell it'll be a re run for me many times.
Thanks for the video. I loved it, but of course so many questions like how did the first cell come to life. Thanks for all the work y'all put in to it, you said nearly a decade? ✌️ God Bless
The music is absolutely fire 🔥
God Created It All
Pretty cool, source?
a yt channel bill wurtz did this in 19 minutes.
What if the Dino's actually built the pyramids? lol jk
This is so boring
I love this channel
ayuda a las persna
Yes 4.5 Earth
Rask Menn did it in 5 minutes
Hi-Story is a pack of lies agreed upon by the powers that believe they be 🔺️👁
Th backround music doh
they should add co2 and oxygen values on the top, with global surface average temperatures to make it even more impactful =D
20:53 this song is sick
We're so lucky you made this video and literally made a movie with such great animation. THANK YOU!!
Ya'll sleeping on Stenian period
... and the floor is lava.
0:42 nah  bro thats a space ship but nice try
59:56  “Mammals take over, it is our time now! We’re almost home!”  With the music, it just sends a shiver down my spine, the dominion of mammals.
Boring
45:00 .
So awesome. In a perfect world, Kurzgesagt would have as many  subscribers as Mr Beast. Just saying.
When this team’s vision is so good I have a tshirt of ai with its unique designs.
100.000.0002% yapping 0% no volume
The one thing I learnt from this is that Earth is oLd
Can you predict if we have a similar pattern that we had on earth seeing an image in telescopes for another planet far away that there could be life right now? Because the image we see in telescope might be from millions years ago.
VERY LONG..
"we're almost home" something about that line makes me tear up every time. we've come so far, and this video really helps put it in perspective <3
I noticed the eras slowly get shorter and shorter
18:26 looked like the Spirit Realm😅
Kurzgesagt does know God created the heavens and the earth right? All I know is that the moon was created during the Hadean Eon. This once, I'm not believing Kurzgesagt research is that true, but the videos on their channel I've seen are 99% true. God spent 7 days creating the heavens and the earth, and the last day he rested.
And The fact is YouTube recommended this video for you
I like how it takes a meteor millions of years to fall to the surface😂😂
Very good video❤
I appreciate the format of this video so much! So relaxing and I get to learn! Thank you all!
Where did the water came from?
I watch the adds for Kurzgesagt
Wish you would have commented more 🙁
I first watched this video a couple of weeks before an island vacation. It really put into perspective the world we all live in, and when I took a swim my mind would sometimes wander to how a good chunk of Earth's primordial days was defined by ever-changing activity in the oceans...  To everyone at Kurzgesagt, thank you so much for working so hard on perfecting this audio-visual masterpiece. :')
"Yo bro wanna play the floor is lava?" "Sure"  *teleported back 4450m years*
This is so beautiful 🥹🥹 I LOVE YOU KURZGESAGT!
Just love the sound 😊
Lets play floor is lava!❌ Lets play the Hadean!☑️
Woah woah woah woah woah, hey now, hey now! What’s up with the classic Doom music for the Mesoarchean, Ectasian, Stenian, and Tonian period?
Hi guys

so cool🤩
wow🥰
gives a lil bit a weird feeling in the stomach when you realize that every second here is one million+ years, holy moly
One of your best videos to date! Love this!!!! ❤
39:54 D-did he just spit for a second??😭😂😂😂
Im loving the music, great mix you've got here
Best video ever in the fucking world
There's Sassy at 31.40 Hey Sass mate!!!
Mad how 4.5 billion years of sound sped up is like music. Profound AF......
i have never seen such a good video! The animating, the beat, and the details is astonishing! Love it! I think this message took me 20 million years to make... Thats a while
I don't know why, but seeing the first plants with flowers left me emotional
goodnight everyone
i think every 5 seconds 8 million years pass in this video
We are truly nothing compared to this planets history
Life is amazing
Mesoarchaen goes hard af bro \,,/0.0\,,/
3:52  had no reason to suddenly be bob as the hadean.
The music is sooo good 😭
Wish so much more was described... there was soo much time... like  what, how, why...
Jesus loves you guys btw I don’t believe in evolution but I respect this dude a lot.
Amazing work. ❤🎉
Who else watched everything without skipping? I wanted to try and feel the length of the history of the Earth, so I watched it all in one go (even though the first 50 minutes were quite boring...). Thank you for creating this informative video with wonderful animation!! It really helped give me an idea of just how old planet Earth is, and just how young we are.
The Ocean Collective version is better
People: I want to learn just a little bit of history for my school project, etc. Nutshell: Ummmmmmm, here’s all of earths history
Human: I can do this on mars in the next 200 years.
Now I truly understand how new we are. Amazing
14.3 billion years later... Who knows this refference? if you do you are a legend.
New sub
12:44 music name pls
This would make a fantastic mobile game
Inserting stupid ads in the middle of this video is a crime. FACK YOU DISRESPECTFULLY GOOGLE🖕
Simply fantastic, and what an amazing electronic soundtrack!
The music feels like Daft Punk and Muse had a collab.
This is definitely fixing my attention span. I have what my family calls learned ADHD, where I don’t have it, but I’ve learned its behaviors. I’m trying to fix this before I get to high school by forcing myself to stay through really long videos.
The little feathered dinosaur looking up at the moon during the Cretaceous period made me so emotional
BRO imagine taking a Time Machine back to some of these earlier periods😮😅
this is an instant classic. 👍👍
fungi reminds of a fungi I met in high school.
fun fact, every frame your seeing is about ~20800 years
This is amazing but to make it better make a vr version😊
Love this video. It ws nice to have on while doing some light work on a Saturday. However, the ads really kill the video. Every few minutes they turn on and will go for several minutes if you don't skip them. Really defeats the purpose. But I get it, gotta pay the bills. It jsut hurts this video a lot more than normal videos.
19:36 - Personal Timestamp
*1 hour* ah yes... very nutshelly
This videos is very good! The ambient is nice! I loved! Thank you for this amazing video
My only question after watching all of this is, if everything came about from an explosion. How did everything we need to be sustained form if there was nothing that it needed to flourish?
Can anyone tell which software is used ????😉
Now it’s very nice. But unfortunately Bill Wurtz has you beat by 40 minutes  History of the world I guess, greatest YouTube video ever
I don't know how to thank this channel for creating this beautiful and detailed content...🎉🎉
Man I showed this to my sister (took me 20 million years to make this comment)
😂 I watched the whoooole thing, waiting that rewarding brief moment when humanity rises, and I got a commercial RIGHT when the timer hit “0 million years”
The Tonian Age looks like the set of Be Prepared
It’s awesome watching and realizing “wait, this has changed over the course of this time period.” It’s kind of like blink and you’ll miss it, except the opposite since you don’t realize it at first it because it’s so gradual.
none of this is factual
My friend: What are you watching? Me: EVERYTHING!!
Stenian is my favourite W algae
Me man i could survive neoarchean This period of earth is dtill extremely dangerous and you would not survive this
the misic. i just couldnt with the music
History of the entire world, I imagine
POV: forgot to put the asteroid in in orosirian period💀
this is so cool and educational that i might forget everything i ever learned! ps my picture is my mom and im 9
🫨🫨🫨🫨 That is alot and i have lots of notes
Good❤❤❤❤❤❤
I had no idea there were so many Ians.
Just the thing to show in a Doctor's waiting room.
This is my favorite item on YouTube,  hands down. I listen to/watch it at least monthly. Headphones are so much better. Turn up your bass ❤❤❤
i have been watchign this x16 speed, i blinked and in that tine teh dinosaurs started existign andd got wiped out, blinked again and missed every phase after  paleogene and msot of it
Accept my appreciation from Afghanistan
BRAVO! I absolutely loved this. Much in the vain of Carl Sagan: The blink of yje eye is quite literal!
10:32 few meteors start to instantly disappear
What kind of joke is this? Seems like still in a learning phase of documentary creation
You guys should make a movie thats really detailed animation of this id deffinetly watch it
Took a lot screenshots for my laptop wallpaper :D

It's so relaxing and amazing, whiln I learn. Thank you so much. ❤️
Grampa is that you
astonishing, glad i stuck through
13:47 I still remember my first billion 😮years 🎉
1:36 the floor is literally lava 😮
I'm actually on a magical bus ride looking out of the window 😂
1 second =1.5 million years. Mind-blowing 😮
The seconds feel like an eternity waiting to see the next era, let alone waiting 4.5 billion years to comment on this video
"Life uh, finds a way" ;) Thanks for the great video
The concept behind this video is truly great. I actually came across it while researching for something similar, only to realize that a video closely aligned with my vision has already been made! However, when I saw the credits rolling with 40-50 names at the end, I thought to myself, "Wow, good thing I didn't attempt this solo."  After watching it a few more times, I couldn't help but feel that, with the resources this channel has, I might have produced an even better version. It’s impressive how such a great idea could still end up missing the mark, despite having a team of 40-50 creators. I hope this doesn’t come across as arrogant, but here’s what I mean:  The visuals meant to symbolize the different epochs feel static, almost like a looping gif. I understand that you're trying to convey the vast passage of time, where each second represents millions of years, and that symbolizing this is no easy task. However, instead of capturing the most pivotal events of each epoch, we’re mostly shown mountains and landscapes, which, while signifying time passing, don’t communicate much else. For instance, you mention the famous asteroid impact during the Orosirian period, yet there’s no mention or visualization of its crater or even a proper depiction of the event. Additionally, the timing of these events doesn't seem to align with your timeline.  The monotonous landscapes really fail to engage the viewer. We’re talking about millions of years where continents collided, life emerged, and entire species came and went, but all we’re seeing is mountains and hills. With the number of illustrators involved in this project, I expected a much richer visual experience.  Another aspect that didn’t sit well with me was the music. It felt like a soundtrack for an intense, psychedelic trip, which, while it might be attempting to convey the earth’s dynamism, was frequently interrupted by inconsistent voiceovers that broke the immersion. I assume the intention was to keep the audience engaged, but these surface-level remarks only served to distract from the flow.  The transitions between eras were also far too vague. When scientists define eras and mark the transitions between them, it’s usually because significant events define those moments. Aside from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, the video barely touches on any other critical transitions. For example, the Great Oxidation Event should mark the end of the Rhyacian era, but we see nothing of it here—just more mountains and trap music.  I also found the depiction of life through the ages lacking. We barely see any life forms until the dinosaurs, which is a missed opportunity. Surely, it wasn’t too difficult to illustrate the fascinating range of organisms that existed before then?  Finally, the depiction of the present era, arguably the most powerful part of the video, does manage to convey the awe-inspiring brevity of human existence in the grand timeline. But, just as you start to delve into this fascinating topic, the video quickly shifts into a fundraising plea. Given the unnecessary length of the introduction, it feels like more time should have been spent exploring the incredible story of early humans rather than cutting it short.  All that being said, I do respect the effort that went into this. However, considering the size of the team and the resources involved, this could have been achieved with far fewer people. It feels like the production costs weren’t justified by the final product.
45:00 this is when john sex invented sex
Incredible music at the Ectasian phase 42:15 . That beat drop though 🙂.
God
That was the greatest video I have ever seen
Genuinely might be my favourite video on YouTube, you guys rock! ❤️
They should do another one of these for human history to really put into perspective how small we are
I would love to see a variant of this with the universe up to the creation of earth, sort of a prequel to this.  Probably be done in 2035 and 5 hrs long lmao.
All this and people believe in various cults 🤦🤦
60 seconds in, and it's already inaccurate. The moon is older than the earth.
This is a master piece. I already knew a lot about the history of Earth. But this video truly puts it into perspective how short we exist. I cried in the end of the video because it gives a really special feeling. I definitely recommend watching this in one sitting without skipping parts. It really gives one of the best ideas of time out of all videos on YouTube.
why does this have 4.4k dislikes this is so good!?!??
Thank you for this unbelievable video ❤❤❤❤
A big chunk of Lava bursted out of sun. It slowly turned hard and rains started. Initially there was only methane and earth had temperature of 40.  Single cells slowly began forming 2 billion years later and forms sedimentary rocks.  27:48 cyanobacteria is the mother releases O2. Which child the planet 29:35 planet freezes 29:35 volcanoes heats earth 39:40 eukaryotic cells merging  41:30 earth's crust thickens , fungi formed 45:00 algae inventing sex 50:00 bacteria dominances 51:15 earth freeze again  52:01 supercontinent Gondwana forms  53:14 multicellular organism formed 53:00 plants spread over planets and consume CO2 55:00 vertebrates  56:30: 2nd continent and mass extinction 😊 59:00 asteroid killing dinosaurs 1:00:00 humans
Stoick: KURZGESAGT...FOREVEEEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!
mad respect for all the animals taking millions of years just to take step. truly awesome.
I was literally thinking about if there was a video about this stuff a few days ago, such timing
this video is like i called the bank and they put me on hold
I like how the periods get shorter for each one
The moon overtime...
"hope you felt something watching this", yeah, my eyes were watering
inly video i ever watched the whole credits ❤
man i would love that poster shame i live here in this period.  love u
successfully utilized my 1 hour 3 minute 30 seconds.
what a experience
Nerds who stuck around for an hour 👇
The perfect video to fall asleep to:
The art is Like eye candy its sooo pretty to look at!!
How to make this into my wallpaper
I never knew your credits took so long.
"But the earth is 2024 years old" -an American
This video is mind-blowing! The fact that all of human history barely registers in the grand timeline of life is so humbling. 🌍✨
Humanity is literally less than a second.
we are so young
Excellent stuff and excellent staff!
Absolutely Peak 💯 🔥
That is impressive tbh i did not watch the whole video but most of it thank you guys for this awesome creation of knowledge. To say it simple... WOW
Flat! I fuckin knew it!
Wow.. did you know that every nano second is a year that is insane.  Respect ++++++++ Aura 999999+E9999999
entire history of the world i guess
So cool to learn about earth when it was born
so animals walked the earth long before we did… and still we, the new guys, belittle them as “just animals”.
why this video look like a cartoon?
I know it wasn't for this, but I found the ambient visuals pretty relaxing. Should make a version with softer music and 8 hours long to sleep to.
This video seems like forever.
I feel like I’m at a rave…. Need to take some molly😂
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!........✌️👍😎
THIS VIDEO IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!
Wow!!! Incroyable!! J'adore! Bravo! 😍🌎
This is BS! God created earth with his own hands. He is a sculpture 😊❤
The final Frontier of Kurzgesagt - in a nutshell
I bunch of geological periods before Cambrian that I never heard of before.
Year 1 : Plant 1 tree ,  suck tree intensely for exygeny
Just fake images hardly any VO
19:09 why is it so hot, wait is it just because there used to be lava there but then WHAT...
thank you, I liked these videos
settling into the cozy warm lava very nice vibes kurzgesagt
It strikes me that we are at the complete mercy of Mother Nature, irrespective of how powerful we believe our species to be.
minor critcism: the moon in the statherian era is smaller than in cretaceous
nice
Mesoarchran track is 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
This video is fake science, read the Bible.
How did they know all of that. OMG
"4.5 Billion years." That number, seemingly an endless or infinite amount of time, at least for me anyway.   Now doubt the earth will eventually become inhabitable before becoming habitable again and again, continuing this evolution during earth's lifespan.   Well before earth's end, mind travel may probably be the norm as humanity takes on a non physical form, and  perhaps taking on a new form of physicality again to be apart of a new world, totally different from what we have today. 👀
4:01 do u think the music was this good back then
I have a Video Idea for you guys. Make a Video explaining all Ice Ages which have occured and how they impacted life on Earth. It would be very interesting.
🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
The video´s not optmized for attention-catching, but rather feels like "Hey that´s a cool idea, let´s do it". Kind of like old youtube. Then on the other hand it´s so professional and well researched that it reminds me of a presentation you´d see in a Nature Museum. I really like this, thank you! ps. I´ll share this to my former geology techer from school, maybe he can show it during a substitute lesson
There it is he said the thing! 1:33
1 hour of lies and misinformation - enjoy!
This is a masterpiece Also, I have the best profile picture here🤟🏻
What an astonishing project! Truly worth the time and effort put in, an enthralling 63 minutes I wish would go on forever.. Almost time for another birthday! 💞
The soundtrack is really good.
Every single one of you needs to be liking at the minimum and sharing on average. This doesn't seem easy. 16:22
This should have been the Fatboy Slim videoclip for "Right Here, Right Now" 😇
Holy crap! 😅 It was just a split second.
Did i missed how the water came? Because i cant see any explanation for it in the video
Yes this video just shows humanity and anyone watching us how dangerous we are to other life and our planet.  In about 100 years we have severely damaged our environment and seem to have no perception of how to get on and make life sustainable. Planet earth has seen many come and go, unless we are careful we will be no different, just do it in a fraction of the time that nature would. We have even mechanised our own decline and we think that we are intelligent!
so actually animals and prokaryotes are older than us in the evolution scale. We, humans, are the newest of species!?
AWESOME!!!!!!!
Idk how many people animated this, but every single one needs a Nobel prize
From the Big Bang, at this relative rate, there’s another roughly 2 hours of pre-earth formation content. Which is just so incomprehensible to me
If it wasn't an AI voice ...
I wouldn't mind having the whole thing played in a club. Masterpiece
🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊
❤❤
Where the rain come from if there was no water
where did the water come from
1 minute in & I got an ad.
Thank you for all the hard work you put into this! This is truly an incredible video!!!
It must be illegal for us to access a video of this quality for free and simply! I was amazed. That's what I pay the internet for.❤
39:59 "Life is only cells" I need that on a t-shirt!
Mans time here will be one of the shortest lived.
Probably the best video on youtube ❤
In all your videos I love the background sounds
Camera man never dies
thanks for this video <3 i really appreciate yall
The music is amazing!
So for more than 4 billion years, life has been non-existent on Earth. I wonder if Mars or Venus is currently in the process of creating life. Maybe in 1 billion years or more, we will have neighbors on Mars and Venus.
I need this a wallpaper
The concept of time itself is exhilarating... As humans we try to quantify it to better understand the universe,  but the real truth of the matter is that time itself unconsciously quantifies us.
🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"plants have started to eat the sun" Is a wild start to the mesoarchen era
8.18 This is not correct how did earth cool and rain without a atmosphere
Watch it, like A regular Movie!
I feel so insignificant 😂
enjoyed every 1.5 million years of it
It's very good that this video got more than 200k views since I checked 2 weeks ago.
Shows our global warming and stuff means zip on that time scale.
We need same but now from monkey to human
Craaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzyyy
❤❤❤
1 hour for all of human history would be interresting
Am I the only one who wathced till the end?
Anyone knows whats the soundtrack from crateceous 58:47 to the end?
Amazing video ! And the music was on point too
Fun fact we dont know for certain that all these events actually happend only some evidences that can be explained with lots of different events as well at this point its facinating but sadly most of it is not factually correct and made up story that if you dont beleive you are CANCELLED
🌏🌍🌎☀️
this video might be the greatest video I've ever watched "don't blink as you might miss the entire human history".
We have been here for 3mins. 🤭
Waited for humans😅
This is truly amazing. Thank you people so much. Great concept, great animation, great music.
I’m just high and jamming out
1:00:44 what u doin in my camp bro?
Am here for the EDM
THE SUN IS A DEADLY LASER
Can we have this one without narration? i love the video and use it to listen at while working. narration can be an distraction sometime.
Beatiful!
That music made me wanna dance like that freestyle dance teacher meme.
now drop the 60 seconds short
It's fascinating how quickly life itself developed, but then went on to take billions of years to become complex life.   As the sun ages it heats and thus complex life on Earth is on a time limit. Despite Earth being billions of years old, the window which complex life could exist may be ending within the next few hundred million years. If any bit of Earth's history was very slightly different complex life would have never come to exist, or ended in the cambrian or something.   I kinda wonder if simple life also 'normally' takes billions of years to evolve, but Earth was incredibly lucky in having this event happen early thus allowing enough time for complex life to arise. An event that takes a trillion years to happen on a planet is going to happen about once a year with a trillion planets.  If simple life takes a trillion years to evolve, and complex life takes a trillion years to evolve ... there will be a few planets that see complex life in a few billion years in this universe
Theme music, info and dates presented, animated transitions... all in all it is just awesome. This video is for sure one of the best informative documents so far and should be shown to all the students as a course.
props to the cameraman
How about these all are just absurd theories? You don’t know what happened 5000 years ago , you didn’t know these 200 years back , now you’re propagating wild theories, what if all these are far from reality and absurd predictions
lol no.
This video is sooo coooll especially as a background video to study while learning things, the musics and animations are amazing and the voice is so peacefull
Perfekt!!!
The animations and music are amazing, this is the best earth timeline video ive ever seen. I keep watching it over and over, would love a deep dive video on each period!
is this youtube prestiged ? damn this channel is perfect !
Beautiful, thank you @kurzgesagt
This is just for the earths history, the whole universe existed for over twice as long and has even more uneventful space!
What about God
TOOL has taken it a whole new level with this one!
Every time I blinked during this video I missed one hundred thousand years
Woah so much work! This is pure and amazing!
I Ain’t watching the full hour but thanks for that info was brilliant!
Lifestory for earth)
hey! i loved this, would you work on universe history too? i want to see it like this
For a channel called Kurzgesagt this video sure is long
Ikl 10:30 10:30 10:31 10:31
“God created earth!” Me fr:
Amazing!
do same thing with mars
It's incredible how ancient life is.
so where did the 100's of millions years rain come from?
who whaced the whole thing?
Mesoarchean bg music is metal af!
This is one of the best educational videos on YouTube and it's really amazing and fun too Thank you Kurzgesagt
Who you calling a bird brain 🧠.😅
-Is this a rave? -No, it's earth history!!!
Wow, god i love history
crazy work
45:00 hell yeah
The fact that we can predict all of this is just insane
the champ channel in the whole timeline and universe
Idk, I belive in God. Earth is far to complete to just have popped into existence. We are far too complex to have evolved.
WOW WOW
This is such a masterpiece. I'm so glad I found this video. I'd love to spend more Saturday evenings like this just enjoying music and your nice animations! You do a good job of giving us perspective on how long time it has taken, but even still, it's difficult to grasp.
The credits are longer than all the history of humanity...
Huge long video, insane list of soundtrack, soothing soundtrack and comfy visuals, cute animations and deep narration by Steve Taylor.  Thank you so much Kurzgesagt team, I did definetly felt something. Thank you for being you, and thank you for allways making me think sometimes a bit more than I normally would.  Cheers o/
The cretacous one makes me sad
The animation is very cool
Where did all that water 💦 come from?
This is one of the coolest videos ever! Great to watch while high too LOL, i love the music choices too!!
This is one of the coolest videos ever. Great to watch while high LOL i love the music choices too!!
4:44 went to the bathroom, coffee, still in the Hadean.
I didn't notice this on my first viewing, but are you saying that the earliest records of fully cellular life predate even the oceans? Like as soon as the floor isn't lava, bam there's cells everywhere? Because that really, really smells like panspermia...
Great work youtube needs to be full of such stuff and such chanel.
"The floor is lava" 😂
Awesome, I'm speechless!!
19:50 sounds like doom music
Let it be known i watched this entire video every second of it without skipping or fast-forwarding from start till the end in my office during my working hours.. i risked my employment for this and I am proud.
here i am, tuning into my bimonthly "4.5 billion Years in 1 Hour" Kurzgesagt video, slowly realizing that I have been tuning into this every 2 weeks FOR 10 MONTHS...oh my god 😭 thank you for dropping this banger that changed my life for the better.. 🧎‍➡
This is so cool man.
there are very many glitches
really really really REALLY impressive
138 to 119 million years ago were the beautiful and peaceful time which i wanna enjoy it alone ❤
23:17 That gave me chills
Great video thanks
I was watching this video and suddenly, there was a knock at my door. It was a cute little Girl Scout. She was selling cookies. When I asked how much the cookies were, she said, "I need about Tree-Fiddy". Well, it was about that time I noticed this girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleogenic Era!
Watching this in September. I love how in the beginning the rocks just slowly kept getting bigger and bigger inside the sea of lava
1:00:46-1:01:47 was ad. So the Advertising time was over 90 Billion Years!
Well done!  Thank you.
I really hope I’m still around when virtual technology gets more advanced. I would love to one day do a real life 24 hour simulation of this. Just be in and experience earth’s history in “real time”. I mean with touch, taste, and smell, not just seeing and hearing. I want to be there, Avatar style.
@44:54 we started fucken!!!🔥💪
you mean god?
You deserve an award for this piece 👏👏👏
my work soundtrack for today
This was so beautiful I'm not sure why it took me so long to watch it for the first time!!! Thank you 😢😢😢
you guys should do one of these for human history and the life of the universe. and maybe other planets like Venus and mars
The progression of the music for each period is PHENOMENALLY done!!
I'm high eating wings at KFC in Costa Rica dancing to this hell of a track 😂
We know thats not how the moon was formed.
3:44 no way it takes 7 millions years for an asteroid to hit earth
53:42 ayo fish alert!!!!!‼️‼️   I waited 3.97 billion years to say that.
hey bro, 1,500,000 years * 63.5 minutes * 60 seconds = 5,715,000,000 years. Please have more credibility. Dislike
16:00 16:01 16:01 16:01 16:01 16:01 16:02 16:02 16:02 16:02 16:02 16:03 16:03 16:03 16:03 16:03 16:03 16:04 16:04 16:04 16:04 16:04 16:05 16:05 16:05 16:05 16:05
I cried when that asteroid hit. "Such a paradise ... life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong. Wait, what's that???"
Insane. Thank you.
love the leitmotif in the video  pretty epic
Best video on YouTube without a doubt
These hydrothermal vents we’re looking aT. And where hoT mineral emerGe. May have been The plaCe where life,  firsT,  DevelopeD…   but we don’t know 😂
actually no one yet:   organisms in the eoarchean: 💃🕺  also, thought I was going to cry at the end when he said we're almost home. remarkable. all of human history in the last seconds..
Music is so bad tho
just noticed that the beat of the music is exactly 120 bpm, meaning you can hear every 2 beats that every second 1.5 million years pass. that's awesome, and it shows the crazy level of attention to detail this channel is consistent with
roses are red, violets are blue, I was bored, you were too.
this is just an amazing masterpiece, its no longer to show all times but just art.
Can someone add timestamps of where he speaks?
this brought me to tears in the first fifteen minutes, earth is so beautiful, we are so lucky to be here.
I loved the sound track, you guys really do great work
amazing <3
again I would like to say, upon examining this video further I think it is the best example of an educational YouTube video ever. I will try and make sure as many people watch this as i can. Every aspect is glorious and it is a work of true genius in the field of science  communication.
Where's the ice age omg  mammoth saber tooth apes ????
Ahem, the earth is 15,000 years old, thanks
👴🏼
“And do fungi things…” 🤣🤣🤣 41:40
@MarkRober I am your subscriber and love your videos
The Rhyacian soundtrack is my favorite!!!
41:26 timestamp
After so long and finally at 53:15 life became more visible to naked eyes. Truly humbling yet amazing video!
This just goes to show the earth created and destroyed so plenty of times over and here comes human. We destroyed it less than 2000 years.
If there arent atleast 3 bill wurtz references im gonna be very disappointed
41:35 Earth’s Crust Thickens, and heavy continents form. The oceans become shallower. Also the first fungi like organisms extend their tubular arms, and do “Fun Guy”things. 😂😂😂
I love how life on Earth, aside from those who live in the ocean, evolved to require water that isn't salty on a world that is mostly covered by salt water. Seems inefficient. Would've been better if everything evolved to consume salt water.
This made me think if life - or at least lush life - isn't just a tiny period of this planet.
Can't believe several tens of millions of years was night-time! 😮
🤮
so bad
Dang pieces of lava stayed up for years
Such a great video!!
most fun 1 hour video and intressting ive ever seen
master piece man
das ist nicht kurzgesagt. das ist sehrlanggesagt. lol.
-oh-5, not "zero-5", shouldn't it be?
And i thought going through quarantine took forever
P.O.V what 7 year old me and bro see playing floor is lava
This is INCREDIBLE! Amazing video! Just curious - are you going to do a version of this, but with just animal history instead of Earth's history?
Yeah 🧜🏻‍♂️🤘🏻
Mind Blowing Statistic:  If this was extended into a 10 year video, then each second that goes by would represent 17 years.
can't believe i watched all of this
Finally, now I can safely say I have taken a 2-billion years shower
The sun causing the glimmer and sparkle in the water of the ocean in the Mesoarchean era was so beautiful. So much attention to detail. Thank you!
Where did the water came from?
Bloody Brilliant!!
wait wouldnt it b like... 2024 years ago bc its 2024 and like its 2024 years ago
there is a lot of 'nothing really happening' this helped put it into prospective for me thanks
God cooked well 🫡❤️
Thank you for this video! I had no idea how many geologic periods came before the emergence of complex organisms. Just billions of years of wasteland Earth, such an entrancing period of time.
I feel so old watching this.
29:44 💀💀 kursgegart what happened there
Love how the music Was calm until the Mesoarchean :)
Once you were played in one of my classes as an example. Me and my friends turned and stared at each other across the room. We recognised your voice and the birds confirmed everything.
Evolution without a. Creator is Crap. Jesus is Lord!
I watch this 1:09 to sleep, it’s so peaceful
what a fucking shit of video 🤮🤮🤮🤮
GRACIAS
I’m telling you don’t skip past 15 million years it’s worth every second
Note to Kurzgesagt: There are a few frames in the Siderian period in which it bugs out and it’s a mini-storm of pixels.
nahhh this is crazy
How does it rain for millions of years flooding the earth where exactly did the rain come from lmao
my god the mesoarchean era goes unbelievable
This video is telling us that space is so big how would this not happen in other earth from other galaxy they might be much more older and smarter thinking to find earth like there or better😶
Why does this soundtrack remind me so much of Terraria?? Especially during the Neoarchean period.
this video makes me sleep😂
*everyone liked that*
it's beyond pur comprehension but I like to compare the earths timeline in comparison to the star wars timelines side by side! I'm a sci-fi fan and a SW fan so it intreagues me to imagine the 2 galaxies n how they "matched up" in parralel time lines!
absolutely masterpiece
45:00 Are you telling me that a species algae invented WHAT?!?
Whoever believes 4.5 billion years is true should rethink his whole existence...  Dude!!...high technology went from 0 to 100 in only 70 to 80 years...   "4.5 billion years" 😂😂

This is the best educational you tube video I've ever seen. Maybe the best youtube video full stop. im going to share this with as many people as possible
This video is sheer perfection. No other word in the languages I know of can describe this.  The music Visuals Narration and explanations.  It's all absolutely peak content.
the soundtrack kind of slaps
How did water just come from nothing tho
terraria
The music in the background is fire
What an awesome video !!
🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I ate a bag of mushrooms and watched this 6 times in a row
This video is insane, 10 months late but respect
most of this found in the quran , Great work!
This is insane. Love this channel thanks so much
I have just watched one of the best videos on youtube❤
K
No BANG-iomorpha jokes yet?
Absolutely amazing, thank you all so much for creating this.
1 second of humans, we're nothing 💀
such fire music
11k of comments almost none of them praise the creation of god!
سبحان اللە
I loved this, made me feel so naive by the emd of it.  I always knew that it took so long but putting it in such a perspective made it seem like much more than I thought it was...  Honestly, I kinda wish it was possible to go back to the first impact and experience ot all from a first perspective as like a ghost or something. Sitting through all those 4.5 billions of years see everything unfold day to day. 😮✨
I felt something for sure, thank you.
Other planets: “Let Him Cook”
Crazy to think the earth is still cooling. The core didn't even form until just shy of 2 billion years ago and continues to grow? Wild to think what the next billion years holds in earths evolution.
Mesoarchean goes hard
amazing work
I love and appreciate this channel and the people who work on it so much
We don't live and die without a purpose. Christ Jesus guides us to that purpose, that we may have eternal life with God in heaven. Don't be deceived by the internet, God is real and he is with us in spirit here on earth. Repent and pray so that you may find the Lord, that he may enter your heart and deliver you from the evils of this world. God bless
Fast forward this video 2x Amazing tune.
False, hate to break it to you, but God is cooler 😎
now where’s 1 hour in 4.5 billion years
666 51:55
If photosynthesis began before the mesoarchean then why wasn't there any oxygen in the atmosphere at the time?
Hi, I'm looking for divulgative books about this topic, covering as much geological time as possible, possibly in italian (or in english). I didn't know where to ask, so I'll start here.
The floor is lava 🤣
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS job you guys did, thanks a bunch for this extraordinary journey🥰🥰😍😍
I wonder if humans were around 200+ millions of years ago. Would we be giant like everything else back then from the abundance of oxygen and so on?
Thank you for making this video! The appearance of life in this world was so amazing.
Amazing how life consisted of nothing but microbes for 3 billion years and then all’v the sudden BOOM Cambrian explosion and life becomes visible to the naked eye 550mlya. Also to think about the fact that the atmosphere was lethal till about 500mlya.
What a spectacular animation video. The soundtrack and information were remarkable. I viewed the *entire* presentation and I'd like to thank all that were involved with it.
cant believe im only writing this comment down right now but i just want to say how amazing this video is. To this day i listen to the full thing in the background every now and then, and the songs never get old. I love doing some quick tabs just to see what changed every now and then too! It keeps things interesting.
respect for camerman, camerman never dies
Sounds like terraria music
Wow. For how brief humans have been on earth, we sure have done a hell of a lot of damage…
Awesome E dorian jam backing track.
This video should be seen by absolutely every single human being alive in this planet
56:19 - shows a scorpion , however they did not appear in the Carboniferous, they appeared 435 Million years ago from the sea.
Damn the mesoarchean has a killer soundtrack
School didn't teach me this
30:16 how long did you take to animate all of this?!
I can officially say I have 4.5 billion years of knowledge
What a great video! 😃
Nobody can actually prove the earth is 4.5 billion years old.
Kurz ost: *exists* Me: yup this is a rain world threat theme now
You have created such a masterpiece, this is really AMAZING! Keep it up guys.
This is more popular than the guy also telling earth lore
29:43 I think The Great Glitch Event also occurred
but like. how do you k n o w what happened 4.5 billion years ago
amazing video fr 🙏
people are so arrogant that they think that their miserable existence of a couple hundred thousand years is more important to God than the billions of years of history before and after us. Looks like God was even more interested in dinosaurs
I look around, my home and I see how much my ancestors worked. 1:31
SO INTERESTING Who agrees? ↓
😍😍😍
59:00 That song is so beautifull that if aliens were to come, that should the hymn of earth
This is why I am subscribed to you guys.
to think how smth like an hour to us is a long time while in that hour weve counted down thousands of millions of years that have gone by is insane all that time to lead here
On this scale all of human history is a few milliseconds.  Meanwhile it rained astroids snd rained on earth for minutes straight.  Truly gigantic events in motion with an outcome.
keep up bill wurtz
this video really put it into perspective just how long a history the planet earth has
The universe is not 4.5 billion years old, our solar system is 4.5 billion years old...the universe is older. ..
Then some religious people in the Bible belt says that the earth is between 6- 10k years old😅😅😅😅😅! Also the almighty made Adam out of some clay, and Eve was created from Adam's ribcage! Hundreds off millions believe this tale......
The dinosaurs were alive 200 million years ago. Even this epoch seens unimaginable long time ago. So how about 1025 million years ago? Or 3456 million years ago! Time just ticking away, in the meantime earth's surface is covered in magma for 500 million years, and for this crazy long  time nothing changes! There is another few hundred billion years,  when it doesn't stop raining meteors.......frigging  unimaginable!!!
Because of the constant meteorit impacts for hundreds of millions of years wasn't the atmosphere full of ash?
36:58 THE MOMENT I SAW "StaTHERIAN" I WAS LIKE "uhm, yeah no, this doesn't have to do anything with therians"
God created the heavens and the earth.
40:00 the track is a banger
now why did the Cretaceous era make me tear up...
44:57 I was not expecting that 😂
anyway you could post all the music from your videos?
But how did i rainn?
You deserve an award for this 🥹 such an amazing job! Thanks 😁
19:42 Half expected to hear The Only Thing They Fear Is You
good
terraria background music
THE MUSICCCCCCCCC *chefs kiss*
This is so cool! I love it!!
“This area of earth’s history is mostly invisible to us because almost none of it is left.”  I’d love to know in which way this part of earth’s history wasn’t invisible.  As well as when it was said “almost none of it is left.” - The word “almost” implies that there is some evidence... what is/was it?   P.s.: Edit was only due to a glaring grammatical error.  HashtagNerdLife.😝
Imagine the add revenue on this vid
there is a similar documentary called <earth, making of a planet> and it had this cool animation of the moon forming and being huge and making big tides of water on earth due to its mass. awesome thing to witness that happened so long ago. it felt special.
Love the heat shimmer and texture of the lava blobs
This is art, thank so much for making it!
ጥሩ እነማ 👍👍
I really love your contents , I am a huge fan too
5 years to make this?! And thanks to mark rober for sponsoring this video because the literally took 5YEARS so well appreciated mark rober!
i have a question how clouds are formed without water in Eoarchean era?
Just think. Some humans have more money than this and they justify it somehow while most everyone else is living paycheck to paycheck...
Nice keep doing more of this❤
"Props to the cameraman .." comments began at the same time this video depicts. 🫡 but those who can't help but keep it up  on using them in each video they watch i guess I salute you for dedication.
2:15 Goddamn lags. I hate this map
In the Haden phase I could see over time it got more rocky the moon too
The transcript of the video is quite comprehensive and seems mostly accurate regarding the sequence of Earth's history and the major events that have occurred over billions of years. However, there are a few areas where additional clarification or minor corrections could be useful:  1. Clarification of Terminology and Events: "The Great Oxidation Event" (27:52): This event indeed led to a significant increase in atmospheric oxygen, which fundamentally changed Earth's atmosphere and enabled the evolution of more complex life forms. It is worth noting, however, that oxygen levels fluctuated significantly after this event and did not reach levels suitable for complex multicellular life until much later. "And a natural, self-sustaining nuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium deposits in the ground" (37:06): This refers to the natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo in Gabon, which occurred about 1.7 billion years ago, not 1.8 billion years ago. It would be beneficial to clarify that this was a specific and unique geological occurrence rather than a widespread phenomenon on Earth. 2. Consistency in Naming Geological Periods and Events: The script jumps between using eons, eras, periods, and events without always making clear the distinctions or reasons for focusing on certain timeframes. For example: "Cambrian explosion" (53:35): This is well known as a period of rapid evolutionary diversification approximately 539 million years ago. However, it would be helpful to clarify that this marks the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon and the Paleozoic Era, not just a specific "explosion" event. "Cryogenian" (51:14): This period is known for its "Snowball Earth" hypothesis, where the planet was covered in ice. However, stating "Earth freezes over again" might suggest this is a recurring event, whereas the Cryogenian glaciations are believed to have been particularly extreme and possibly unique in their extent. 3. Minor Errors or Potential Misinterpretations: "Right after it was born, Earth was a hell of lava..." (0:33): This description is accurate for the Hadean Eon, but it should be clarified that this period also involved heavy bombardment from space debris, which significantly shaped Earth's early surface and atmosphere. "4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld" (1:06): While correct, it's important to note that the term "Hadean" reflects not just the "underworld" aspect but also the chaotic and hellish conditions of early Earth. "1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans" (47:33): This description might oversimplify the Tonian period, which is also noted for significant tectonic and geological activity, including the breakup of supercontinents. 4. Modern Context and Explanations: The script mentions, "Earth gets more and more familiar" during the Cretaceous (59:20), but this could be misleading since much of Earth's current geography and biota differ significantly from that time. It would be more precise to state that the planet's continents were beginning to assume positions more similar to today’s configuration. 5. Omissions or Missed Nuances: There is no mention of key evolutionary developments in the Ediacaran period (52:19), such as the emergence of complex multicellular life forms. While these are briefly alluded to ("Suddenly life gets big!"), further elaboration would help viewers understand the significance of this period in evolutionary history. 6. Typographical Errors and Style: Some parts of the text, such as "We get trees and forrests" (55:45), have minor typographical errors ("forests" should be "forests"). The narrative style switches between informal and scientific tones. Consistency in style could help maintain a more uniform presentation. Overall, the transcript is well-structured for a lay audience and accurately represents major milestones in Earth's history. A few adjustments and clarifications could enhance accuracy and educational value.                                                                                                                     --------------ChatGpt             Video is Awesome, WOW
The human at the end 😊 Happy 10th anniversary/?/ kurzgesagt
Love this format
Boje się ludzi, którzy jednocześnie wierzą w to co jest na tym filmie i wierzą w to, że tak mały element jak człowiek wpływa na losy jakiejkolwiek planety przez to, że nie segreguje śmieci xD
terraria viiiibes
6 soundtracks were recorded from this video, but there is one more that's missing. The final song is the one near the end of the video, starting at the carboniferous period(55:50). It is my favorite but for some reason they forgot to release it as a soundtrack along with the others?? Did anyone notice this?
This would be an amazing animated wallpaper!
55:47 that dumb fish had to go out of the water 🙄.
It’s almost annoying how the universe takes so much time and energy just to create one species of intelligent life form.
This is such a stunning video I can't even find the words fitting to describe it. The music, the sidescrolling style choice, the graphics and effects. Bravo! And thank you!
keske turkce cevirisi olsa
sped it up so it can be 31:31 1/2 long
I'm watching the video, NOT listening to it, but watching it all in one go, I'm at half right now Finished it, best thing I've ever watched, ty Ily
Where did the rain came from when there was only lava...
Bro I forgot it was a video about billions of years passing by. Was straight up jamming.
The floor is lava 💀
I’m here from TikTok 😂
good animation, but sadly most of it is bullshit
Cool vid
Shout out algae Bangiomorpha pubescens for inventing sex, you real af for that
01:35 the first the floor is lava challenge happened 4.5 billion years ago
Tfw there's 10 minutes left on the video and you're only at the Tonian age
how did this first rain happened ? as there were no water vapours to form clouds so that it can rain.
It's would be cool if you guys did something like this for the history of the universe
thank you
My question is how do we know this is what happened 4 billion years ago… we can barely see Saturn and 95% of our ocean is unknown, but we know 4 billion years ago what happened to earth. Lol I love it! But how 😑 ya know..
This is one of the best videos on internet
The best electronic music show ever
I find myself musing about the meaning of life between the audio.... I feel like a god passing thru time and space.
Brilliant job of showing 4.5 billion years passing away.
The music goes so hard🤤
I nominate this video for the Youtube hall of fame. You know what, no this video transcends Youtube.
the birth of lebron james was not mentioned why is this?
this is really giving me terraria vibess 🙏🙏🙏
Martin Maria Jackson Sharon Anderson Kimberly
This video is very educational keep it up Kurtzgesagt😀😀
This video is painfull for creationista
this video just made me want to not use coal anymore
the music in the background of tonian is a bop
_Bill wurtz:_ *"i heard you say..?"*
I am not a very religious person in general but I believe in humanity and the nature for this exact reason. The fact that we have become what we are in what is essentially a blink of eye in the time scale of this planet is a unspeakable miracle. Our life may not even be a frame in this video but somehow we live, die, have fun, and overcome loss in that short amount of time is a true testment to how much our present is worth.
pov the snail didnt get to you
That snare sound in Ectasian tho... ❤
how did it freeze in the cryogenian era?
It's insane to think about the fact that you have such a long video of a bit over an hour, and then the whole human history is just over a second. That's like 1/3600, or ~0.03% of the earths history.
I’m scared to blink and miss a whole era
There are people who don't believe in this
I very like this thank you
Wait, what’s that? -Famous last words
This makes me want to create a fact binder and put in a bunch of papers about Earths history YES I NEED TO DO THAT
54:25 first sharks start forming 53:27 Fun fact: One of those early creatures is the “first creature”/ kinda first complex ancestor. I forgot it’s name so if anyone can remind me then that would be great  This organism is shaped kinda like a pancake
18:38 bookmark
“The Siderian” Siberian: “You called?” Russia: “You called 911” America: “💀”
What an amazing concept. I'm gonna watch this every day now lol
This video is actually just phenomenal. We need many more of these one-hour type videos that aren't literally just movies. Perfect.
Half of this doesn’t even make sense it’s all just a theory
Kudos to this amazing video.. thank you for the so effort you guys put in the video, it’s was indeed educating ❤❤❤❤
Wow this is insane 4 years of animation this is such a good history also it’s free! Very impressed!
Marvellous! Biggest collab to ever exist...
I'd love a little meter reading in the top left corner of diff stats like temperature and oxygen levels as the earth evolves ~ super cool video
It's insane how little time it takes humanity to potentially destroy the earth.
Thank you for this video, it was a very nice and relaxing. But I have a question. How did it start raining, where did all that water come from? From space, or was it already under the surface of the earth?
Music is amazing!
Camera back to this jewel
Absolutely loving it! Thank you Kurzgesagt!
This is brilliant! Thank you for your work ❤
This is my favorite video❤❤❤❤❤ please make more
💩
God created the heavans and the earth :)
Shoutout to the “Stenian” Era, gotta be the best 😎
can you post the playlist pls its actually so good
What would HAPPEN if we accidentally blew up the SUN 💀
LETS GO INVENTION OF SEX
Hey dude, stop scrolling coments, you're gonna miss millions of years.
I do in few words: Bang, sun, earth, live
Do a collaborative series with melodysheep
Hall John Smith Jose Jackson Donald
total bullshit
Thank you so much for making this video, it alwats helps me sleep and i sadly cant finish it without falling asleep..
thank for your video, I didn't blink!
Soundtrack for Ectasion and Mesoarchean hits hard ngl
The Beginning of the Music in the Neoarcheon and Cryogenian felt like such a peaceful night with a full moon.
0:12 0:14
Johnson Robert Rodriguez Maria Jones Helen
Where does the first rain come from
But if the Moon would disintegrate if it got too close to Earth, why didn't it disintegrate when it collided with Earth in the Hadean?
There is something extremely interesting about the chapter patterns in this video.
Just amazing.... that last blip of human history in this expansive timescale. All the poetries, all the wars, and conquest, all the inventions, and romances, all the sufferings and falling empires.... flourished from such a blip

Great 👍 thanks 🙏 you all rule!!!
Geez even 1 billion seconds is 52 years, imagine 4.5B years.

Saquenlo en español no sean giles
Anyone else here from TikTok?
Holy shit this is incredible. it's like you made this explicitly for my brain.
the way i go from my bedroom to the bathroom
The music over Sediment is a fcking masterpeace!!
45억년의 지구의 역사를 1시간으로 이 영상 한국어로 나오면 좋겠어요! 너무 멋지고 BGM도 훌륭합니다.
For the shortened version look up  "History of the entire world, I guess"
I slept at 6:27
My new phrase when it's been raining heavy for a long time is going to be "Oy, what is it out here? The Eoarchean Era?!"
Use me as a god isnt real button
You do not understand Prehistoric and Historic. Fail
This should be in schools instead of PraguerU bullshit
Link to music plz?
Wow I Can't believe I've been studying for 4.5 billion years.
can you do another 1h video with another topic?   Some ideas <3 : Pregnancy of a whale  Pregnancy of  a human The Life of the blood cells The life cycle of a star The life and flight of the monarch butterflies
The camera man never dies Edit: omggg i love this videooooo❤❤❤❤
Soundtrack is 👌
The hadean period say 4500 million years ago in the top right corner. I thought it was billions
😮😮😮
One last video before sleep
I love music in Neoarchean and Siderian. 23:51
"In the Stenian Era, the band TOOL released their first album"  Don't think I don't hear and love these influences haha
Can't wait to show my kids this video
And we joined and destroyed
This video is so moving and humbling. It really makes me feel so grateful to live on a planet with such a beautiful history. It's amazing to think how there was so much before us, that eventually led up to this point, and we are just a very small part of this entire story.
Bravo 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
5 years. 5 whole years. 5 whole frigging years!!!!!!!!!!! They are truly masters of passion
meaningless nonsense
awesome work
Watching this video and the one about AGI really puts into perspective how wondrous this journey is.
Humans represent barely a second of time in the calamities in this video and the industrial age a small small fraction of even that second of human history. Yet we're somhow to belueve that we're "destroying the planet" LOL
When you realize that half of the timeline of the planet hasn’t even complex life and we didn’t show up until the very last moments, you understand that the story isn’t about us…
music hits hard tho i also feel like nobody shares videos anymore and why is every god just greek
This actually took less than one month which is insane
Does the acid burn humans
imagine being a teen in the paleoarchean period 😔
If this was the history of the universe, but at the same rate, then the video would have been just over 3 hours long.
You folks are SMOKING CRACK!
Can we have a video like this but for the evolution of humans and technology/civilizations etc? That would be sick.
I don't really know why but I cried
God.
I choose to watch this whenever I remember about it because I love learning about how this planet came to be. It os really cool and entertaining to me. Earth is simply such a unique planet and there is so much to learn about it, even after the amount of information we've gathered.  Side note, the production of this video is amazing. The music is fitting for everything, the animations are on top, there are no distractions between, etc. I love this. I love to come to your channel and check out what's new, as well.
🙁🥺🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
1:03:31                        00:00
the music has no right to be this hard…
keep up the good work its hard but i believe in you
Always back to watch this every other month or so, such an amazing video. Thank you.
And where did the rain come from?
So it rained for millions of years?
🤩🤩🤩WoW
Man, that DJ that was born at the beginning of time realy  slaps
I hope u get your earning from your work
great content, as always
this squeeze of 4.5billion year into 1 hour is better Zip n Rar combined.
The Hadean era felt almost as long as the speeches bit at the olympic opening ceremony
why no therapsids tho :( ?
props to the tardigrade filming all of this and surviving it just for us to watch
@kurtzgezagt - Thanks for this awesome video 🙏 Please do the same but with Mars and Venus and maybe the Solar System next to one another... so we can grasp what was the system like during the various Earth Eons !
The Moon is so perfectly around, some people say that the moon was made not formed, my child is driving me crazy with questions. He's way smarter than I'll ever be and he has not learned it from school, just on his own studies.
They said a lot of stuff was a certain age and in years go by and then they claim it's a different age. My kid asked me how could you possibly know for sure how old the Earth is, how is the tested ??
Oh no, I blinked
You got a love science. It’s just all theories and guesses with some facts.
Love you sooooooooo much Kurzgesagt ❤❤❤
Un infinito di anni, in una oretta. Così possibile, davvero. Sono d'accordo con Kurzgesagt, rispetto e ammirazione. Grazie mille per tutto. In tutti giorni sono qui. Mi piace molto. Rilassati, grazie ❤
Grazie mille Kurzgesagt 👍👍🌿sono molto felice dì questo materiale YouTube. Grazie grazie ragazzi. Rispetto, tutto rispetto per voi. Grazie mille ❤❤
Terribile tutto la Terra. Una evoluzione fantastica. Bravo ragazzi Kurzgesagt 👍👍🌿😊
It is just unfathomable to imagine that it was raining asteroids for a billion years and then raining for hundreds of millions of years. It is impossible to put that into any type of perspective. It is truly insane.
I love this so much. I wish we could experience all that with virtual and almost physical reality to "fly around" in virtual bubbles and explore all this with and without time lapses.
What caused all that rain (how was it able to form) 3.8 billion years ago?
Amazing 🎉
Where did the rain come from?
This is one of the best concepts and executions of a YouTube video ever. holy sh*t.
The floor was really a laver 😂😅
You need to update this as fossil life appeared 2.1 billion years ago. Also genetic research suggests that live may have poped up 4 billion years ago. Lots of failed starts for the tree of life.
Teacher should’ve let us watch one hour of this instead of taking a whole year of history classes
Watching this video is not a waste of time

3:50 ... Ahhh that drop though...  :)
1:37 .... THE FLOOR IS LAVA!!!! :)
기온과 대기농도도 좀 같이 표기해주세요❤
The content ideas the producers of these videos have are brilliant but they always do justice with the way they communicate the information! So grateful for this channel and the knowledge it shares - a LIGHTHOUSE OF YOUTUBE. Thank you.
8:37 “It rains for millions of years.”  England: Hold my tea.
Love the soundtrack. Well done, Epic Mountain. 👌🏼😎
Why is there acid 10:00 And so many acid formed 12:05
"How long was the Doctor trapped inside the confession dial?"  "We think...four and a half billion years."
45:00 WHAT
great
The songs used in this video are perfect <3
Hi, I am a little girl and I love your videos Kurzgesagt
Naw the other species suck we took over in same amount of time it took them to go extinct
I've watched this whole thing 4 times now
i wanna live in statherian wbu guys
Isn’t Lucy 3.5 million years old though?
The music background is the type of music that would come out of terraria and I love all the background music. They sounds nostalgia.
This is amazing ❤
holy fuck im farting thank you kurzgesagt
This is life changing actually this changed my persona❤
one of my favourite videos!!
I never realised emergence of big organisms will take 50 minutes. I'm very happy that I watched all anyway. Thank you, great work!
i wrote a comment & lost the track of millions of years😢 what should i do now
Theia jumpscare
This video right here.... Is an absolute freaking masterpiece every thing is ao detailed and beautiful.
Haha, this must be made for stoners.
Amazing work as always ❤
i am in love
Where the rain came from? If there's no water existed in the planet?
I think there's a reason why we invented logscale
uh oh, i'm about to be in 10 hours kurzgesagt binge again
The teachers in my school used your plastic pollution video for an assembly
Why does it rain and where is the rain coming from. And why is it not forming life on the moon?
this has a _STRONG_ terraria vibe with lol
44:52 WOOOOO LET'S GO Bangiomorpha Pubescens is a real one for that
I come back to this video every so often. It is just brilliant.
Changed my whole view of life you've done it once again Kurzgesagt
I need to watch this again while stoned
Here’s a wild reference: If we represented the 500 million years between the Cambrian explosion and present with an 80 year human lifespan, the first humans would have emerged 5 month ago, farming would’ve been invented yesterday, civilization would’ve emerged 12 hours ago, an hour ago, Europe didn’t know about the americas existance. 30 minutes ago the genius Isaac newton is born. The French Revolution took place 20 minutes ago, a bit past 7 minutes ago WW2 started, and 6 and a half minutes ago, the first nuclear bomb is detonated. Human population doubled in the last 4 minutes as anthropogenic mass Increased 7 fold, about the same time the humans land on the moon. Almost 3 minutes ago the Cold War has ended and the internet is born, almost two minutes ago the World Trade Center is struck. 20 seconds ago, anthropogenic mass surpassed biomass. 9 seconds ago chatgpt3 is released to the public. 6 seconds ago will smith eats spaghetti is released. 2 seconds ago the sora trailer goes live. Tomorrow Chernobyl will be safe to inhabit and the sun will blow up in 700 years.
Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong... wait, whats that?

The animation is truly beautiful
This is truly a masterpiece and we're getting a study about our planet for free. The beat the music is so nice and relaxing to listen to I love your work kurzgesagt
What a majestic video
If some people isn't interested on watching this, the music alone will persuade them
We can all appreciate the animation, but alsoy Hod this music is just as captivatimg!
Chill existential dread and visuals to learn/study to.
No mention of the lizard people in this vid? Smh my head
Why else came from that TikTok???
Nuh huh, it was God with the help of his son Jesus who created Earth, not some funky science
This is sooooooooooooo good!
Thanks for your awesome video
This reaallllllyyyyyy makes you wonder if ANY research regarding "climate change" is viable. We dont seem like can even make a microscopic dent into what the universe is capable of
The only channel that science teachers should show video
Now this thing right here is PURE ART!
Disappointed that there was no animated asteroid strike in the Orosirian. Good video on the whole, although I would have preferred 2 versions. One with music and visuals only, and another with more voice over information.
Once you were played in one of my classes as an example. Me and my friends turned and stared at each other across the room. We recognised your voice and the birds confirmed everything.
Much hot
You have nice animation...and your "Fairytale" is fun to watch ..."But" geology radiology erosion dose "Not" support that theory....let alone the fossil record also dose not support evolution......well look to God and Jesus for the truth ....even now we can not accurately measure any dependable way the speed of light....
Now imagine people who want to live forever
It’s been a while, can we get an updated version to include the past 8 months as well? Thanks man!
Dude hats off to you thanks for this much hard work please make a video on how life of humans evolved from quaternary 😊
Early Cretaceous is so wonderfully pretty in this video <3
I thought they still had no idea how water arrived on Earth. How does it rain for millions of years with nothing to evaporate and turn to rain?
Google and You Tube should comment on this video.
so longggg. yet so good
i love the refence of jurasick park when you said lives find a way
Absolutely exceptional video - beautifully animated, amazing soundtrack that comes together to give us the tapestry of life. Literal goosebumps at the end. Amazing Kurzgesagt team, thank you so much for this masterpiece
Can y'all release a version of this without commentary? The music and atmosphere slaps
This is too long bill wurtz did it better
i noted down everything said in this video for studies, lets just say it took me 2 hours, but huge thanks for doing what you do.
The score of this video is still awesome! I love the Stenian-Tonian one with the prog-rock line. Top noch! 👍👌
I think I saw a bird that hasn’t been seen for 140 years😅
This is so intriguing, it’s cool how we pieced everything together to find out how things were created and how the world works. It’s sad how even though we know so much about our planet and the solar system we know nothing about the entirety of the universe however. We are just so minuscule and fragile compared to the universe so we will likely never find a true well backed up answer.
That shows God's creation. Beautiful. 😊❤
Please do the animation about 4.5 Billion years in the future pls when the sun goes super giant and engulf our earth.
Hey you’re taking inspiration from everything! Good idea!
Damn, we got an hour summary of the entire history of the universe before GTA 6.
Camera man never dies!!
Not sure if aready asked but does anybody know if the backing track is available anywhere? My friend loves this kind of atmospheric, background sound
Love, Respect and endless emotions… Kurzgesagt, you’re a blessing ❤❤❤
who’s here bc of tt
I have got to say, that animation was amazing, the timeline, the events, all that our Earth has experienced in its 4.5 billion year history fit into a 1 hour video. It's crazy to think how new we humans are in Earth's history; and how long it took for the first lifeforms to begin. The music was amazing and fitting. It is sad, that much of the Earth's species were wiped out by either asteroids or volcanoes. Just goes to show the power of the Earth and foreign objects. Definitely one of the best "history of Earth" videos
I love it but wid motion sickness its hard for me to watch it continuously 🥲
wow i no earth history
I can't believe I get to watch this for free. Thank you!

53:43  Such a burst of colour and kingdom/phyla ancestry now....
27:58  'Oxygen...burped out.'
RESPECT Kurzgesagt is the BEST
Why is this so long
At the very last second you see the Homo sapiens aka the sometimes dumb human who thinks we are the best 💪
One of the best things I’ve seen ❤
this is so cool omg 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The animation is really cool and it’s 1 hour I wonder how much time it took to make this video
Question why is the asteroids at the beggining or hadeon peroid are only going right
Bill wurtz did it first w heels on
Cameraman never dies😂❤
Hot dog fish at 54:04 😂
Not only is this incredibly well done but it's so interesting to put it into a visual perspective how little not only have we been here but all mammals. The earth is so rad
يشبه قصة الخلق في القران مافيه اي تناقض 😂😅
This animation is probably on the blood of interns 😂😂
This was amazing! How did I miss it when it came out? :o I love videos that put humanity, all our troubles and worries and all of modern history into perspective - in time or space.
Wow thanks for all this information
Great music!
Music is so calm and comfy
This is my baby sensory video
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
U guys didn't need to be so faithful about making the years pass in order u could've just made a time pass and get to the point
I wish you explained more stuff
Oi
Hats off to the sound design n animation department beautiful video!!
This guy is up there with David Attenborough
Wow. This is just so, so fascinating. I turned this on at first to help me go to sleep. Boring documentray, watchever, but I see so much further past that now.
Watching just how incredibly long took the Earth just to cool down, I wonder if Mars got his chance to evolve life much faster? The all implications of this are just stunning. And give even more amazement for the fact that Earth received so good conditions to evolve life that long.
who else is trying to fall asleep lol
Sorry fellas but bill wurtz did this in like 20 minutes
Me absolutely jamming out during the Paleoarchean period.
I liked the 20 mins one better without even seeing this bcz idk just feel like 1 hr is very long :)
This is my favorite animated video on YouTube currently. It’s such a wonderful color palette of our planets history from being a molten firey baby planet to the humans came.
water
8:07 = land
6:04  moon = puple
Can someone tag the artist they are using ? Amazing
I have been watching this channel for years! I love science and logic and all learning but have a super short attention span… needless to say I love your channel!! These videos should be in school curriculums!
"don't blink or you might miss the entire of human history"... Knowing that we, humans, literally appeared in less than the last second, knowing that earth, the universe in general, was just there all that time without us.... makes me feel so lonely, so afraid, so unimportant at all... It makes me terrified.
We are the universe experiencing a human
I love this video,i learn more about earth history
"...don't blink...", I love it.  Thank you for segmenting it and us into time.  This puts into perspective.  Cheers, and keep posting.
this gave me random anxiety 🙏🏻
This was a beautiful educational work of arts, thank you.😌
Creative Uplift: To the North East South and West world 🌍 wide may the blessings of heaven continue to shine upon you and yours on this beautiful day of the Lord Jesus Christ and God 2024. Amen 🙏. RQQ ✨. So mote it be ✝️.
The music is growing on me.
Bill Wurtz did this in 20 minutes
but where did the rain come from? at eoarchean time?
And to think that this is the half life of U-238.
This is by far the most wholesome comments section I've ever seen
Why asteroids on fire, when planet without atmosphere
I love this ty for taking ur time to make this
My favorite song is in 35:00
It still blows my mind how some dinosaurs lived closer to the human age then the age of the first dinosaurs. I think its greatly underrated just how long this species was alive for
1 got anxiety and put it in 2x  8 minutes in 💀 Our history didn´t even made to the video since it started 200.000 years ago. My head hurts after this video, no joke
U missed something, How can our universe and others planets form? Where did they get the materials? Nothing can produce nothing there must be a begining right? Some kind of a creator like God, order and design points to an intelligent creator, God beyond human understanding no matter how intelligent we might think we are we are just not, think about it why are we here? Im sure we didn't just exist for no reason right? I think we have purpose in this planet, think about it, our DNA the way we think and make decisions, the bible gives me clear understanding about how the world was created and our existence here on earth, we all know we cant deny that there's a God, God cannot be defined by science if it does it means God is limited by science, there are some thoughts in my mind like our emotions are they real or chemical reactions? Where will life take us after we die? But for me I believe in God, the God of the bible, the bible thought about our world, about a new world that soon will come, idk when that soon is but the bible says 2 peter 2:8 that A thousands years is one day and one day is like a thousand years, Life is unpredictable we don't know the ends of our lives, but I assure u putting your faith in Christ u will never regret, he the reason that I learned how to love, he thought me life, that this world is nothing, he gave me hope and according to him eternal life in heaven.
Aye yo im retarded, thank you
I watched 1 hr 3min and 31 sec of the video
The music is LIT tho...
i want to join them so bad, i can get my own birds
this wasn't  just a normal video in youtube, it was a masterpiece, a perfect definition of our life and this universe. Tnx for your hard works and effort that you guys put in this video.
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
The orosirian beat goes hard
Understanding how Earth formed made me look around my room and see posters of vocaloid and my pets sleeping on my bed and I can't beleive I'm alive today. I think I could die tommorow completely happy because I lived. Thats it. This is an insane world. Its so INSANE. Taking my mind off of humanity and zooming out makes me love life EVEN MORE!!! The things that make me happy are so insignificant and so am I and ...I guess im just so happy? ... I'm happy I got to experience and see what an insane world there is. I couldve been a lil nautical in the ocean but NOPE. I comprehend that megurine luka exists and brings me joy. I love this world. Theres nothing like it. I love it so much.
I love the geologic time scale so much randomly finding this recommended to me is so amazing I love you all!!!
🎉
Master piece
Mesoarchean: When the DOOM music kicks in...
damn the Hadeon beat goes hard.
Where's my umbrella☂️.. Honey it's raining outside😂
And people say nah, all of this just spawned 😂
Book marks 26:16
they indeed invented sex
Wow! Cant wait for part 2😮
this is true, i live in mesoarchean era. good times 👍🏻
Just because of that tiktok video, I'm here watching.......
I have been jumping in my bouncer for 650 Millon years
so. before sideria. when microb absorb sunlight. what is their output? can we still found those organism now? can we recreate this as experiment?
man time flies.. almost like an hour ago i was witnessing the beginning of earth…
It's music is lit 🔥
Read the quran and get the answer of your question
KURZGESART YOU ARE THE BEST ANIMATORS!
Why is the sun turning into the moon
I really cried omg...😢 This was such an amazing vide
Who is here from Tik-Tok?
Lol I can tell nihilists spend a lot of time on YouTube
I use this to sleep its real good
33:30
So awesome...
this video is a banger
TikTok Christopher scanlon brought me here😂❤
the soundtrack goes hard on this one, unironically thinking about adding this to my music playlist
Is 'The floor is lava' one of the oldest games?
I love your content please don’t die
what's your advantage  me : i witnessed earth evolve from scratch
All this for us to spawn in and destroy everything
Insanely good. Makes you fucking think.
Were do i get the last 4.5 bilion years of my life back
This is the best screen saver 15:01
Thanks for the video ! ( you, not the asteroid ! )
i definitely feel something watching this
amazing❤
Bro thinks he's bill wurtz
That's one of the most intriguing timeline I have ever witnessed till now. Thanks a lot for such a devotion in the video we're watching today.
respect to who animated this it looks high quality and its one hour long damn
Yeah, but the universe started over 4.7B years
this awesome video deserves wayyy much more that 609k likes!
I watched the whole 1 hour!
How in the world did it rain for millions of years!?🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
DAMNNN EOARCHEAN GOES HARDDD
the fact is though is that 1 hour of animating was just wasted for fake history😂
51:49  I believe life was preserved in the ice until it had melted refrozen and melted again
Check point 32:06
They say everybody is unique, a strand of ur DNA has never been seen before in the history of time! Yet in the same sentence. They will say you were a mistake, big bang theory, evolution theory. Both attack the book of Genesis. Making it so that we don’t question when they tell us that we are a creation without a creator. Read the bible ppl
Read the bible than you will see how earth is created
Now explain to me why I need to pay tax
Life..feels…different…Are We For real?
Jeeeez 😬😬
Who came from tiktok?
shoutout to cyanobacteria for the burps
This is brilliant
Now, I am certain that this is all made purely by Allah SWT. It is mentioned in the Quran before discovering this
At exactly 19:40 the music made me feel like we gonna see Doom Slayer any moment now😅. This is so awesome.
earth had such risk of rain ahh music
If I was a teacher I would let my students watch this for an hour while I sit back and play on my phone
Here from Christopher Scanlon 🫡
Por favor háganlo en español
i love this sm
Yay TikTok
Bravo
Thats insane how all the creatures we know of barely took up 3 minutes of the video
Im quite late to this, i cannot believe i didnt subscribe to this channel earlier, watched this channel for years.... (unfortunately with a massive gap, but am back actively watching what i missed now) Gosh i loved this video so so much, just the sheer majesty of life on this planet, how this planet went from a hot magma rock to the life-filled world we call home... its just amazing, these kinds of videos are amazing, thank you so much for making this kurzgesagt
amazing
Nikhona?
45:04 😂😂fun fact sex was invented 1190 million years ago
Best Timelapse in the history of planet earth
Thanks for video !!!!!!
.
Watching this to the instrumentals of "My Heart Will Go On" is just on another level of emotional taxation. Hard feelings.
that was amazing
I think this is the best thing Kurzgesagt has published.
"I think I skipped too far" ahh video💀
Aint no way I just watched the full history of Earth in an hour💀
I fell asleep and this quick nap took about 700milion years
En español cuando ?
Masterpiece 😮
So the first sex happened in Stenian period 😂
The fact is i am broke and i need money
This music is just if Dark Side Of The Moon era Pink Floyd came back to make a album that is made with modern equipment but still in that style i love it!
19:58 who have Kurz permission to go this friggin hard? 🔥🤘🏼😖🤘🏼 🔥
Its so relaxing just watching this
You are so damn cool!! the Absolute best work! 👍
Who came from that TikTok channel??
Currently here after seeing that one tiktok vid lol
The beginning of anything was not just created out of nothing. This whole idea of Earth starting and the Moon forming from a collision is absolutely wild. Just use critical thinking, do not get spoon fed everything you believe.
GOD IS TRULY AMAZING
where's the squirrel and the nut?
Jesus is real
This is now my favorite video of all time.
The people that got this video from that one TikTok’s🫣🫣👇👇
I just came here from tiktok
God is amazing
Your hard work is Worth it! My students love this Video!
The team should try to make more of these videos like this one except for different planets, black holes, and stars
I’m watching this as i study and it’s the perfect balance.
😮😮
People from tiktok😊
Who else here becsuse of that one tt video?
Vid is so ass this shi overrated
who come from the tiktok guy
Tiktok recommended me this
Only real ones know that earth was big ball of watter
Who came here from the tiktok video
I think he must make a movie about this
How did  it rain if there's no water i though some asteroid that contains water crashed into the earth 🤔
Who's from that one Tik-Tok guy))
Who's from that one Tik-Tok guy))
Yoooo... I was awaited for this movie.
Yaar 4ra pe cricket betting ka maza alag hi hai, odds bhi bohot sahi hote hain
4ra pe fast withdrawals se bohot fayda hota hai, paisa turant milta hai
I don't understand if beginning of earth is just lava and heat, so how come there are rain?
bravo!! ❤🌍
Who's here from tiktok
Who’s from TikTok👍
I am the only one that saw the tiktok video about this?
So we came from that TikTok
I love this video so much!
ectasian soundtrack goes v hard
Mesoarchaen music slaps
45:00 Sex is invented 1.2 billion years ago 🤯😏
no recent history to show how delusional we are hits
Damn I really teared up at the end. I love being a humans
I love this video so much! I've watched it countless times when I need an hour to just get stuff done. The point I can say "Oh we're only to the Mesoarchean? I have time for a sandwhich!  Keep up the great work Kurzgesagt, every one of you is an amazing birb!
man this shi is asss
Im gonna use this video as a a background of my desktop. So beautifull!
The fact that the progress bar is always mowing is insane and shows the dedication thank you Kurzgesagt ❤
The truly unbelievable component of this all? Billions of people deny that this ever ocurred. Their silly incomprehensible book(s) tells them there is a gross floating man in the sky who snapped his fingers, and these thousands of millions of years never happened and is an illusion.
Earth was playing floor is lava for too long
Mesoarchean soundtrack is actually hitting so hard🤟
fucking hell, this is actually fun to watch and learn, make them show this in schools
this would actually be an insane wallpaper
45:00 👀🔥
19:26
I LOVE THIS THAT I EVEN ACT IT IN ROBLOX FF!
Without a doubt the best animation I've ever seen in my life.... get it? Seriously though, in my top five!
Get a life
i watch all, this video show exactly how long are the eras! congrats
Grandpa's Story's be like:
Earth felt like that badass lethal gangsta girl transition to a soft sweet loving grandma.
I don't know why I'm in tears at the last minute
please use audio track in hindi/bangla
New AI simulation by NASA, some months ago suggests the probability of the formation of moon (at least in an irregular shape but separate body) in a matter of hours.
The soundtrack is absolutely amazing 🤩 good job with this
i thought it was history of human but its just geology of earth do you have video about human history from the cave man until now?
QUERO O BR DESSE! BRASIL
Tomorrow i'm going to watch this video on VR. Maybe is more immersive
bla bla evolution Evolved you believe this crap??🤦‍♂
32:00 Looks like pokemon arena
I´m learning English, I´m studying too. And this is my first video that I see. Thanks.
This is so cool!
Everyone's praising the camera man for filming for that long, but nobody has given thought to the editor who managed to cut down and time-lapse that much footage
Bro really made the universe movie 💀
“Primordial beats to study or relax to. And learn about the history of planet or something idk”
Most useful video for thenks 💖
I want the tagged posters I want to buy, but I am just a little
Anybody else kind of addicted to this?? ❤
Fact of earth : oxygen is made from trees and tress are getting chopphe
so we are a result of a huge fire ball cooling down
but how tf did it go from fire to life, it makes no sense.
18:15 Is that a tornado?
Bill wurtz did it better
This is gold.
music was too overbearing
U just earned a sub 😮
Video anda sangat bagus, saya harap semua orang di negara saya bisa melihat ini karena IQ orang orang di sini sangat rendah
1hour in 4.5billion is CRAZY
can someone make a timelapse of this so it is without the sound
This is my favourite video in all of YouTube. Me and me friends love your work, you truly inspire us!
Thanks for the ride!
Very cool video
life finds a way 😀
This vid is sooo long yet soooo Amaizing. The cameraman needs a huge reward for this, and for sticking around for so long to pull it off.👌🖖
This video seems insanely amazing, but it becomes better once you realise the entire thing is accurately captioned when you turn on CC.
ƌangaƌƌ
This was an amazing watch
0:51 8:04
We really can't say more than THANK YOU  for this masterpiece
News anchor: now for the development of life we go outside to dan. Dan how's the earth looking out there? Dan: well as you can see behind me we have a alot of astroid impacts forming the oceans and bringing life to our planet so if you were planning on having a beach day you'd probably wanna stay in as the temperature is getting over a million degrees so break out those fans it's gonna be a hot one!
I really liked it!
very interesting!
Where did the first rain come from?
I'm really enjoying this video! Beautiful animation! The music also makes this timeline feel very exciting even though this all happened over billions of years!
Just like history. The shear amount of effort put into this will go unrecognized.
"Algae Invented sex" is a hell of a way to phrase it. Not inaccurate, just humorously colloquial. Like they got bored during the Stenian era and decided to f**k. Relatable.
This is just a long slideshow. Boring but informative. Make some scientific assumptions and show us how it  could have gone through these changes
THIS  IS SERIOUSLY SO GOOD IN EVERY WAY!!!!!!
Very cool video. LOVE IT!
kurzgesagt could tell me 1+1=3 & id believe them
There are actually still LIVING stromatolites in Shark Bay in Western Australia!! Its the most extensive living system in the world and are over 2 billion years old and still releasing oxygen today! It's so cool to think of something THAT old and important to the history of life less than an 8hr drive from me
Subscribed thanks
I got seeds from this time period when everything started I mean our first life!! this Nano seeds still seems to work become life even after 4.5 billion years how cool is that!?
W cameraman
Wow ❤
The fact that it's a linear timeline is just beautiful, what a risk it was to do so ! Incredible job (as always)
amazing
Props to whoever animated 1 hour in 60 fps. If somebody doesn't understand how hard it is 60 fps is basically drawing 60 images per second.
If space and time are the same thing, I'm surprised that cramming 4.5 billion worth of time into 1 hour didn't create a black hole
Please make more of these. Its quite amazing to do deep work with this in the background.
No ads!! Finally!!😃
Maaaaaaannnnn the Stenian Age was BS, but still, had sex 10/10 😂
Send this to an atheist
I’m not gonna breath until kurgegsat replies to me
Heavy asteroid bombardment?? Made of WHAT??
100% we are some young alien kid's petri dish project.
Why is there so much dang arguing in these comments bro
beautiful
This is great to play while studying I love your vids
Best channel!! Discovered it in 2013 / 2014
If we as a species survive 1 million years into the future, I'd be a surprised ghost. Misuse of resources, nature and each other will catch up quickly.
19:30 is that doom music?
now I see that earth is really flat
im sorry this video is just a long ass slide with reallly to non to learn from the video just normal points not explaining anything in depth and to add to it its just a couple slides and silence.
real
Thank u make it for me  i really love it❤
44:59 shoutout to bangiomorpha pubescens for possibly inventing the best thing since sliced bread
This video is really amazing
I can't thank, the team who came up with this video Idea, enough. This is so GREAT. I hope that you could come up with similar videos or even elongate the same one to two or three hours with the same great sound track in the background. It really help improve work and study concentration. Keep up with the great work.
@ 45:08: "A big reproductive improvement for many different reasons." We all know what's going on here. The kids won't know but we know...Giggity.
Fake news. This is not what bible says.
When ever I am studying I will play this this is aaaaaaammmmmaaaaaazzzzzziiiiinnnnngggggg
❤❤❤
Dear Kurzgesagt will be have this in spanish?
Geological time freaks me out. Thinking about it starts to give me an existential crisis.
Bro Is the next hill wurtz
Ok I sleep with this
We need a VR version of this!
What's impossible to grasp is the inanity of this narration and the cheesy animation.
19:20 when the mesoarchean music kicks in
I'm just waiting for the Flintstones to go by.😅😅😽🦜🖖
i would absolutly watch a 10 hour video of very detailed kurzgesagt
Basically a more in depth version of the entire history of the world, I guess
Every bird must be in this one.😊🤓😽🦜🖖
Well done, that was brilliant
This is almost psychedelic - the soundtrack, the passing visuals and sparse narration that brings you into a daydreamy state of mind, how mind-blowing it is to try and comprehend the vastness of earth's history. I'm not high or doing anything else - just sitting with this surprised with how entertaining it is!
the fact how small amount of time humans have been on earth is terrifying
damn lets see if this is interesting
very nice video:D I was seeing very sleepy, then dream just like 40 min and a lot of millions pass through;O :D
AMAZING!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video is just gold. I hope you’d do other content like this one. Pure gold, in everything. 🙏🏻
I’m suing, I was advertised one hour and got one hour three minutes and thirty one seconds. Now I am late to the doctor and have died.
Still bubbles 😊
Question: Without an atmosphere, how did it rain?
You so smart can you teach me😢 1:00:58
Imagine thinking human induced "climate change" can hold a candle to anything the Earth can do on it's own.
No Ad No Sponsor No Shitpost Straight up on to it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible meditation with an amazing music! Please make more of this
This is like that fish lamp I had as a kid but more interactive
DJ Mother Earth spinning the hitssss
Should be shown in every school
It's good but I like the other bill wurtz one
19 june ko phir se dekha
Best thing I’ve ever seen
How do we know multi cellular life wasnt earlier than the cambrian explosion? Maybe that was just when skeletons got popular in evolutions (something that can actually survive fossilized long enough geologically for us to discover). Maybe the Cryogenian age encouraged cellular lifeforms to cooperate for survival thus selectively encouraging more and more parasitic copperation and then bam you have multi cellular lifeforms. But those wont leave behind any trace of their existence so what if we have a giant survivorship bias?
Videos like this is exactly why I buy kurzgesagt merch, to support this awsome job
And thats the History of the Entire World, I Guess.
Ofc the most replayed part is the last second  Human moment
why do I feel 4.5 billion years old now:/
Mesoarchean music goes hard
i will never look at the Moon the same way
Love this music video❤️
If museums and planetariums had this type of music id go more often
The longest loading screen ever
What the fuck
The music i awesome!!
The music is perfectly implemented, loved it ❤
the earth is definitely not 4.5 bill years
bill wurtz made it in 20 min
55:45 Somebody hit Tiktaalik back to the ocean please???😂😂😂😂 59:25 First blossom 😭✨❤️
19:40 why this sound like doom music tho
i like everything about this whole Video (and every video on this channel) who's with me!
Things escalated quickly in the quaternary.
5 million years...Longest.Ad.Ever!
2:05 how it feels waiting to age so i can start transitioning
my mind is blown
1:38 “the floor is lava”
I like your animations mostly because it’s a shortcut when my parents make me watch “educational videos”😂
57:04 Lystrosaurus! One of the few species which survived the great dying and lived into the triassic!
53:38 yipppeeee
11:00 is basically ireland
"The floor is lava" lol. I always wanted to see a proportionally downscaled real-time timeline of Earth, but I knew it won't be feasible to make it interesting as most of the time nothing was happening. They still made it look so exciting, I just watched the full hour without blinking with my eyes. I got entirely absorbed by the emotions of the video and it made me drop tears at the end.
A video like this focusing on just the history of multicellular life would be interesting
an hour...God
Why the moon cooled down faster? It's cause of its size?
what a amazing video with amazing explanation ❤❤😮🤯🤩
This might be the greatest video ever uploaded to YouTube.
So those dinos took millions of years to move?
Man i love finding hidden refferences in kurzgesagt videos.  My favorite being pokemon refferences
this is absolutely beautiful. I watched the whole thing and I loved every part of it
The funny thing is none of this is provable just made up theories out of someones imagination
You are wrong
I am God
You know if you translate your video in Hindi you will have more viewers.

This is amazing!!
I enjoyed this very much!
I always love kurzgesagt, I started watching 2 years ago, and I love it so much, I will always support you guys❤❤❤❤❤
wow
Shout out to the animation team
this is amazing the music is a banger and the art and attention to detail is amazing this channel is the best science channel ever
19:33 ALIEN SPACESHIP?
Finished
Where is that GOD part from Indian God Thing
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen
Tbh with all this knowledge we possess and the true facts that cant be denied like that dinosaurs were a thing, i seriously wonder how people can still be religious. Ofc everyone can believe what they want but its so hard for me to grasp.
Hah that nothing compared to the history of the world I guess
Bro, Your voice is so calming I fell asleep in the middle of this video 😭
As a geologist, this video is my geoporn
이게 가능해?!
The floor is lava. The sky is lava. *Everything* is ffff'ing lava.
This is probably one of the cool's video that I've ever listened to while I was studding, Thank you :)
Thinking about what life looked like during the Cambrian has lead me to a realization: SHUCKLE IS OLDER THAN RELICANTH.  "...dude, what? How are you getting that? You're talking about POKEMON?!?!?"  Yeah. Anomolocaris (Anorith and Armaldo) are from the Cambrian, meaning the other GenIII fossils, Lileep and Cradily,  are from the same time.   From there it's easy to see a connection between Lileep, Cradily and Shuckle.   Shuckle could have existed as early as 520 million years ago... TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION YEARS BEFORE RELICANTH.
After the demise of our species, it's possible that a new group of species will evolve, and some of them might be even more intelligent than we ever were. Just imagine the possibilities! They might discover things that we never dreamed of, and they might even be able to communicate with us using time machine. It's a fascinating thought, and it makes me wonder what the future holds for us and for the planet.
I come back to this on occasion. It already feels nostalgic.
I love the animation and music but honestly I don't really like the Linear timeline factor, I feel the first few billion years could've gone in about 15 minutes and we wouldn't miss much on the animation side, and a lot more could've been spent on the time during actual life on this planet like the Cambrian onwards rather than a few minutes on each life period and nothing on humanity rather than more than half of it being staring at empty rocks and water, bit of a cop out and a waste of the animators time if it wasnt likely just AI assisted - disliked
"1.2 billion years ago in the Stenian, not that much is going on. Except, the algae bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex."
This must’ve took so long to animate, this video is 1 hour long! I love your channel too! ❤
Can I just say that some of the music chosen for this video is on point! This shit's a whole vibe!
Kurzgesagt should do one about the ocean where the submarine goes all the way down to the deepest parts and shows a ton of new sea creatures.
Repugnant is a creature Who would squander the ability To lift an eye to heaven, Conscious of his fleeting time here  - TOOL _Right in Two_
Not a fan of ASMR, but this, I like this.
But the earth is 6000 years old
The fact that I learned more from this than all of school and being in 6th grade Says something
It took me a few million years, but I finally wrote this comment.
Returning to say Epic Mountain’s drummer is dope, the track mountains is so sick
New bed time story lets gooooo
Earth can’t be 4.5 billion years old, even for scientific reasons
Well, God is very lazy...
Finally something I can rely on for my project 😁
nice video of history of life, it was truly amazing that you guys took 6 months to reach your anniversary. maybe this will be used in educational purposes in studies, even in collage, even in the future generations.
Sooo sooooooooo may unnecessarily long clips. And toooooo many important details completely left out.  I was expecting to see the transformation from apes to homo sapiens…. From empty desserts to fully blown bustling cities… 🤦🏼‍♀️
59:54 What a bummer 😔
Is Kurzgesagt First Hour YouTube Video
The soundtrack had no business being that hard! compliments to whomever composed it
The story gets kind of tragic in the last few hundred million years
Is this one of the videos with Cinema 4D? because it looks 3D.
WOW!!!
Life, uh, finds a way
Thank you for this effort
I hope there are more videos like this out there, I'd love to be able to study different topics this way while doing something else
This just debunked all religions 🤣
Hey, uh, Kurzgesagt, can you make a video about the mass extinctions not just the Chicxulub, please for me?
that soundtrack... you can tell Kurzgesagt is headquartered in Berlin <3
33:46 anyone else hear the chord progression from that Moby song at the end of Jason Bourne movies (Extreme Ways)
19:40 Doom Theme?!
I can’t believe I sat through that whole thing
how is he drawind this? this is incredible
Most boring 1 hour ever
Put this in the background as I was working on a huuuge classwork presentation, and honestly I can say I have never been this productive   I truly love the artwork and soundtrack of this whole video
Awesome you guys feature your own music! Cheers Epic Mountain
34:03  *insert Vredefort impact here*
Imagine being the moon. A piece of earth ripped off only to watch your parent planet slowly flourish and prosper with life while you do literally nothing
Imagine if they shared the music, it would be as cool as this is
terrance howard was on to something when he said the earth came from the sun, if we were just a big ball of lava then we probably were some ejection
Bro, that's so trippy

I was yearning for a video like this, I’m gonna sit back and enjoy this one!
Amazing work, I’ve been watching this channel for four years and they have never disappointed me. The animation must have took years from how smooth and clear it is, it’s truly beautiful and deserves to be put in a science museum for all to see. What especially amazed me was that they didn’t just have beautiful animation but that it also had music that was very enjoyable. Watching this video was like watching the video “Nothing, except everything.” It was new, exciting, and very interesting. Which is very refreshing since I haven’t seen a better video than this in a long time, it truly incorporates new, pleasing, exemplary, and innovative topics and new ways of expressing those topics in one video. Truly Inspiring.
Man this could have been SOOO much better. Too much time was wasted with just music and the exact same animation sitting here on your screen for 10-15 minutes endlessly. Could have easily been filled in with more DETAILS about what is happening.... Just felt like a drawn out waste.   Other then that i still liked it because the idea of the whole shown was absolutely brilliant...
Thai sub please
Love it!
Forgot about Jesus Christ
It's crazy that the Earth was empty, uninhabitable or only single cells lived on it for most of its history. Even the Ediacaran 'animals' who look really very simple are 'only' ~550-600 million years old. And complex life maybe has another 500 million years but not much more.(because of the Sun becoming hotter)  It's just not fair :(
Wish I had watched this at 9.I could have decided to be a scientist!
Imagine haven't watched this 2 WHOLE times ;)
NOBODY can ever satisfactorily explain to my aching brain: WHEN AND HOW DID THINGS BEGIN **BEFORE** this? Most say there wasn't a "beginning". That is not scientifically possible.
IT IS NOT LIKE THIS
Birb spaceships traveling 0.9999999999999999999999999996511% the speed of light were able to confirm the veracity of this video
Incredible video. It seems to me most people dont understand quite the vastness of time and our second in it. If I was a teacher, I'd show this to my class
man I'm writing my essay and then I just hear "invented sex" lmao
where is the rain initially coming from though
interesting
AWESOME!!!!!!! Could slow it down to also show the evolutions of humans and how we evolve
Took me 533 million years to finish my cereal 😊
I wish there was a version of this with the voice and sound but no score to have this as background with other music.
59:48 My friend Gabriel is gonna be so mad
How did we go from the floor is lava to enough water to have oceans? where did the water come from? where we hit with ice meteors?
Music at the really end is really nice and in general is pretty good.
This guy made me sit one hour and watch earths history also schools:1min = 20min
Fun fact: this is not a fun fact.
If the history of Earth is a straight line of 4.5 kilometers, then humanity is about 3 meters long.
Easiest hour of my life. Right around the Jurassic, I started to well up with emotions. The fact that those animals lived for eons without a single clue that they would all go extinct...Yet, we wouldn't be here otherwise.
i enjoyed it  lot .. thanks Kurzgesagt😄😄
Earth-like but why
Can I just say how thankful I am that this channel exists... for free no less! I don't have kids yet but when I do, this channel is going to be playing all the time. I can already see my kids' rooms filled with your posters. Thanks so much to the whole team for all your continued hard work and passion ♥
Perfect. Absolutely perfect
How do these first ever cells get created. Do they just spawn in when they feel like it or what.
Just as I remember it. Give or take a billion .
Life must be the universe's way to make time pass faster, in a way it's an imperative to develop life under thermodynamic laws. Yet we don't see advanced life around the universe. It's mind baffling but well, just because we don't know why yet. Soon we will (at least soon according to this time scale)
` ` The ancestors of birds do Bird things, Life uh... Finds a way ` ` Almost Made Me Die
The Mesoarchean time period goes so hard
Would love just the soundtrack to this. Whole thing is amazing! The k you for this. Could we get a mix with just the music?
@kurgezart i had some questions  - Hadean era, why isnt the moon spinning? - Hadean era, is the stars in the sky were acurate?  - Hadean era, in the end of this era, there were some cloud? is that cloud? if yes what does it contain? - Hadean era, is there any type of life form that capable to life in this era according our knowledge?  i will come back later to finish this, my baby just woke up now, and my wife needs me,
An hour-long video having 10 million views shows how far Kurzgesagt has come so far. Please stay accessible to people who love to learn ❤❤
33:48 I am disappointed that you mentioned the creation of the largest crater on Earth yet you didn't show the meteor. pff
This was the best ever. ❤
You left out the birth of Godzilla and the other Kaiju. Feel like that shouldn't be glossed over.
dude the carboniferous period is so cool
00:08 Earth's History in an hour 06:53 Life begins to emerge and Earth starts forming oceans. 18:41 The era of continents begins and microbes expand in the Mesoarchean era. 29:44 The planet freezes over and ice ages begin for millions of years 39:59 Life evolves and develops on Earth over billions of years. 51:20 Life on Earth evolves and adapts to new environments. 56:03 Life thrives in the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but faces mass extinction in the latter. 1:00:43 Earth is ancient, but humans are new. Crafted by AI ?
Incredible. Kurzgesagt may be the best channel on YouTube.
Thank you kurzg... grew up with all of you 😊
Great video! Well done!
wtf
I only once noticed there was a slight glitch in 29:42
Amazing journey
This video is amazing, please make a video of the history of the universe like this one 👍😁
i've just realised that humans are only one more age of the earth.
Is there anything that you don't make with love and passion?! Thank you so much
13:49 billion years
Is the Soundtrack going on Spotify? The Hadean song is  so good!
This video and it's music is perfect for solo shroom trip
Please make more about biology, something we almost know, not about history which we only think we know 😅 with Library of Alexander (babel tower) burnt, the most of the records about our real history is still missing.
No se porque pero del Cretaceo para adelante y el final me emociona hasta lo profundo de mi ser. La musica, la conclusion todo es tan maravilloso! Muchas gracias por este fantastico video!
Kurzgesagt & Birds History of the earth:  Fantastic beauty, anime, music, storytelling, camera and narration ! Congratulations on your 10th anniversary!
Amazing!!! 💯
I loved it. ❤ Almost cried at the end.
Amonites
During the periods where nothing really happens, what separates it from the previous? The tiny life forms are still doing their thing, I feel like the prior should be extended until the next significant event.
Bangiomorpha pubescens invented sex just for me to not have any
The video and animation are very great but the music is INSANE. Your whole team did an amazing job :)
i fw this heavy
It would be nice idea to organise a party and project this and dance to the music while being educated about the earth's hisoty!
The Orosirian beats are simply amazing. One of the greatest eras for music in the history of our planet.
Junk science, oil industries have debunked it all!
The music sounds a lot like the open source electronic music  project created by Jean Michael Jarre in the late 1990's.🥰🥰🥰
Is this EARTH HISTORY??
I love it
Hadean
Eoarchean
Secondly is eorchean
19:40 subtly doom theme
They should do a bunch of these. The last 1 million years in 1 hour, etc.
Hehe the floor is lava
At Hadean if you looked closely you could see a bird at 4320M years ago (Edit:2X speed is cool)
The backround music is so cool!!!
I've looked into various eras and periods as a part of a project I'm working on, and this video puts so many events in the wrong place. I've grown to trust this channel over the years, but this was a good reminder that you should always double check your information from multiple sources.
You should do a video explaining the great extinctions explaining how they most likely happened
No offense, but y'all evolutionists are crazy for actually believing this mess! The Creation account from the Bible is MUCH more plausible.
Impressive material!
Well done i am am doing my studies cool music to listen to love it.😃
U are legendary guys thank u very much kurzgesaget
Special congrats to the composer(s) - the music is fantastic, complementing the animation really well & pretty much carrying everything for the first 50mins or so.
59:44 69 million years nice
I must have missed the part where there was planetary collision that lead to the creation of the moon. Otherwise super cool video
I wish my planetarium would show this
Imagine watching this but it was 4.5 billion years long
So….      In short in a nutshell
Kurzgesagt means, in short
This was amazing. Thank you. Can you do the entire history of the Universe now?
Super cool video,but I think it would be better if you made it 4.5 billion years long
I swear I had a dream about this…
New music album. Nice.
“Yes Kurzgesagt man” we all say in unison
When that mesoarchean Era album drop? 😵🤘🤘
I am crying, and I can’t quite tell why. Is it the beautiful animation and music or the fact that it took so long to make, and you still kept going? You show me 4.5 billion years in an hour, all of Earth, our home. No one could top you on this one, Kurzgesagt.
do the last milion years of human history as well, that would be amazing to watch, and well done for this one as well
The eukaryotic cells in me felt mesmerized watching this iconic masterpiece. This is just ineffable.
Wow
This is so amazing. I just wanted to say I bought the 12,024 calendar, I love it so much! My birthday is in July and the Quasar is so cool!!
This man is a better Science teacher than anyone. It's so clear, majestic, and in a cartoony form so it's easier to understand. It's quite incredible of how underrated this channel is. Keep going you guys, it's incredible!
❤🤩❤😍
how did life began so early?? Surely life was already present in Tea, ormaybe an asteroid...
Nice to take a nap...😅
At 19:56 when those drums kick in?. Who said this music has to be banger. GAWD DAMN
This is amazing. Brilliant concept. Timely. Relevant. Useful. Innovative. Interesting. Fun. Vibesy. I got expletives coming out the dingle dong!
Forget about the memes, what if THIS was all that was left of humanity ?
I'm playing Stellaris at the moment and I turned off the music in-game and listening to this instead. So fitting.
I need the track name for the Hadean
Who created the music for this ? It's so good
This is such an amazing idea...And the music is 🔥. Kudos to the composer!!!
This video has become one of my ultimate favorites on youtube. Thank you amazing creators!
At last! We have discovered the CEO of Sex! 45:00
We get this amazing video for free. Ad revenue for YouTube and creator. Ad agencies get their products viewed by millions of people. Everybody wins.
This was amazing!
I wish I could give this video more than one thumbs up
Hello, Spanish is my native language and the way you write the numbers does not make sense, in the video the scale is in millions of years, and thousands of these are counted.  How is it possible that thousands of groups of millions are called billions and not thousand of million?
That was 1 hour worth of my day
props to the animators
Absolutely fantastic and stunning! Nothing like this has ever been done before... a God's eye view of time and creation. Huge congrats! Work and thought like this makes Kurzgesagt truly addictive. Watching an entire hour just to see man in a blink at the end truly sets the scale of things
Hi Kurzgesagt! I wanted to ask could you make a video over what would it look like if the EARTH was instead the MOON and the MOON was instead the EARTH?! I watched one of your videos detailing the period of Hadean at which an asteroid the size of Mars hit and some of it formed the moon… so what if more of that Astroid went off? Forming a moon bigger than the Earth? Would the earth orbit the moon instead? Would the Moon take the role and be the planet orbiting the sun? Would there still be life on either planet / what would be the case if the moon and Earth were equally the same size??
23:26 gulp gulp gulp gulp
This is the true test for people, who have low attencion spans
All the respect for editor and animator for this masterpiece 🤌🤌🤌
The one thing I like about the neoarchean era is the actual cell going flying across the screen
This was so phenomenal. What an amazing way to demonstrate just how old our little planet is <3
Are there similar educational channels with animations like this one? 😔 I discovered this channel just recently, and wished that I knew about it earlier.
WERE NO LONGER IN A NUTSHELL!
It seems like a long journey to get here, but if the universe is to last 100 trillion years, it must be a race to get started.
This was great to play in the background while practiced drawing. I would love if you guys did more stuff like this!
They think it all happened by itself! Allah created everything including the universe ! No one can refuse  it
Do hell to future
a
terraria music
mesoarchean would make a great meshuggah album
You should do one like this except its all on human history
The first sentences is not the truth. Human are made in the image of God.
Got stuck here in Statherian period probably because of ads, any tips on how to get back to the future?
4.5 billion years of evolution and I’m on the couch eating pringles.
These people deserve respect for creating these, props to all of them 👍👏👏
First half of the eras are unnecessarily long, second half of the eras are shorter but with a background of nothingness, could've show all the living animal on that era instead of nothingness. Wasted 1 hours+ of my life and still knew barely anything. 👎
Imagine all this was turned into a subnautica like game series... (Foreshadow(Maybe(If I have time)))
scared to blink and miss a billion years
During that unknown period at the beginning, there must be so many proteins and DNA bases being evolved.
Notice how two peptides join together by a reaction which removes 1 water.  How might this happen?  Perhaps the tides repeatedly filling, then drying out in the heat when the tides go out?  Chemistry is what opened my eyes to this possibility.  Without that one fact only a nerd would know, evolution sounds far fetched.
13:43 Thank you ☺️
i programed the whole space invaders on scratch while watching this lol
Im not joking when i say that this is the most beautiful video that i have ever seen. Thank you for making this vedeo.
Calrazy to think multi celled and organisms have only been more than building blocks forb7 seconds about, or less of th8sbwhole video. One whole frame from left to right at the speed they have.... imagine what the flip would be if it skipped 4000million years ahead!?!?!
euff is 4.5 billion years old
Why don't u make a series on world history describing all important incidents & the driving force behind
This is so cool! :D Great job!!
How much money did u make off this video and how much did u spend and how much profit do you make yearly now? (Pls make a video on that I have my own YouTube channel and I’m researching ways to make the best content)
I love when
Beautiful voicing and animation 🥲🥲🥲
I feel privileged for being able to watch this. Thank you so much for taking your time to do such amazing stuff.
Beautiful video! Amazing job! Thank you so much for this inspiring achievement you are sharing with us.
'Dont blink or you might miss all of humanity'
What is the song/melody going from the Cretaceous and onwards? I always come back to listen to this melody/song. It someone can help me I would be gratefull 🙏🏻
That first beat hits
Hi youre on a rock floating in space
Other than my wife this is the most phenomenal thing I've ever found on the internet. Absolutely outstanding, thank you.
Earth lore: 1h Full Cod Zombies lore video: 6½h
Complete rubbish.
Not gonna lie you could've slowed it down . Mo miss
Brilliant, really puts us in perspective and the music was epic!
2:27
Now I need a sequel. All of human history from the beginning to current time.
29:42 why is it flickering
And where are all thousands of Gods that managed all these events???
Great video. Thanks. Just hated the millions of years of commercials I had to watch in the middle of it.
yes yes, we dont know what happened like 9000 years ago, yet we bullshit ourselves we know history from the beginning to end...humanity has no shame and humility. We dont know jack sh1t!!
When earth collapses with other objects, it doesn't hit your plane?
Hahaha 5 billion years....evolution hahaha....you hybrids...went through "evolution" and still hybrids....no brainers....
we are so blessed to have stuff like this just readily available to us for free. life is good
this video made me realize how small humanity's exictence compared to earths
43:12 This sounds like a long lost Risk of Rain soundtrack
Absolute masterpiece.  This would make a dope TV screensaver.
And thereby all religions fail.
Is there science behind this or is it theory?
And in all that time the universe hardly aged a third. All of this, only one planet. While maybe not as active or varied, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, _Mars,_ they all went through that time. So did the sun. So did every comet and asteroid. So did other stars around us. So did the galaxy. So did _all_ galaxies. The amount of information that exists is astounding. And that’s nothing to say of the future. While the past is grand, the future dwarfs it beyond measure.
How do we know all of this??
Is the was an atmosphere in the eoarchean era? How did it rained?
We witnessed 4.5 billion years in an hour. You guys literally broke science!! 🙏🙏🫡
I love youuuuu Kurzgesagt 😍🥰🤩😘
29:23
Just brilliant! What an amazing video and an amazing channel!  Really gives some perspective on just how long it took to get here...and how short of a time we have been here.
Animated 1 hour? dam
"In the beginning," after the fire, how did it rain... rain comes from clouds, which comes from water... so at that time where would the water had come from to make clouds that have pouring down rain?
25:07 My Bookmark
Starting getting some real DOOM Vibes from the music about halfway through the mesoarchean period
this video made me religious
Who else watched this on half speed? Still hard to comprehend a million years in a few seconds but gave it that epic dragging feeling!
53:41 ANOMALOCARIS MY BELOVED !!!!! WE'RE CAMBRIAN EXPLODING WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥
Omg 🥲
The .MUSIC!!! 🎶💥❤️
It's always mindblowing to think how much did it rain to cover the whole planet.
Everyone mentioned the animation, but don't forget the music. It's so good. I am so amazed that I enjoyed this video for FREE!!! Keep up with the good work. Thank you!
Underrated as hell
it has a glitch at 29:42 idk why people didn't notice it
this is the best type of videos to watch when your baked😂😂
I LOVE THIS AND THE NARRATOR IS AMAZING ❤
BETTER THAN ANY MOVIE I HAVE SEEN MY WHOLE LIFE AND I PAID MONEY FOR THOSE AND THIS BRILLIANT AND INTELLIGENT VIDEO IS FABULOUS ❤
Bill Wurtz is sending his regards..
I absolutely enjoyed this. It is amazing how only a small portion of Earth's history was shown and is still fascinating; and even if it was in more detail, it would pale in comparison to how much Earth has experienced overall compared to what we truly know
The Mesoarchean is polyrhythmic like Swedish death metal.
I wish this kind of thing were more prominent in most peoolevl's minds. It isn't human life which is extraordinary, it is complex life. Simple life was easy and fairly quick to arrive, complex life is a recent and fragile thing. We must spread complex life to the rest of the galaxy (where it is probably absent).
If you watched though this whole thing without skipping a bit of it, your a legend
this music made me hallucinate while sleeping
سبحان الله
Its taken 19 years, but Ive finally found the best video on YouTube
This is a phenomenal video.
Much better than "playlist for study" for me 😂
Shout out to the raindrops falling for 6 million years
just here to say that the mesoarchean theme bops
51:23 "how did life survive? we're not sure..." that's such a real answer lol
if 1 normal length video takes 1000 hours this would AT LEAST be 10000 hours extra. this channel is the best
Looks like a lot of work and dedication, indeed. Congrats.

Why would cyanobacterias release oxygen, the very element needed by complex life. Sounds like Gaia to me.
8:20 ONLY a few HUNDRED MILLION YEARS  😭  Also tysm for making such beautiful animation for us, it requires a lot of hard work especially with how long this one video took, I appreciate it 🫶
A masterpiece to watch while celebrating April 20
I fucking love you bro.
Amazing job!  I really loved this!
Amazing video! Fantastic music!  A few notes. 1. The current researches show that life had more chances to develop in geysers. 2. The authors missed to mention the Oxygen Event.
ive watched this a few times and it still hasn't gotten old.
Do 1min montage in 1h
I dont know where to start, so i will "only" tell the thing i would expect to praise the least in such an educational video: the background music is dope man, like serious fire. And everything else in this video is even better, so thanks a lot!
is it just me realizing the part of my existence on this Earth is just 0.00000000000000000000....1%  ?
the music made it all the more beautiful, amazing job 💗
Thank you very much. This is priceless.
I like your voice
this was absolutely beautiful
Could you make a video of this, but no narration please, this is really calming to watch.
our era will probably end up being the most short lived
Love it!! Animation and music are perfect! Thank you so much =)
🙏🏾
😂
This is my favorite Kurzgesagt video <3
I actually felt a lot of things watching this thanks for asking!! Earth is amazing. Life is amazing.
<33333333333
Okay, you birds ate that up.
"In the beginning..."
"I sat high watching rocks passing by for an hour" button ===>
1:36 "The floor is lava!!!"
I don't have the time to watch this.
Ok the video is cool and all, but... HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE?
And well, now I have so many questions…😏
Help me
It's crazy how I was able to just sit down for an hour and just watch this all. Great job animating, composing, writing, and voicing!
I Call Cap
1578 Million years ago the narrator spits!
The earth isn't 5 million years old. A day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day. This is the sixth day.
I wonder whether Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted about this
Genesis 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
The fact that we got this for free is insane.
Hey not gonna lie this is sooo good I did not skip not 15000years not even 1year I was waiting for them to say something and just enjoying
I love the choice of music for the great flood. It feels inspiring, especially since life comes from water (probably)😅
This video was a whole vibe
watch it till the credit ends...
So schnell alles
Nice of Tool to drop by in the Tonian Era
Earth's creation biblical version: "Meh. Underwhelming. It's too simple." Earth's creation scientific version: "At loss for words and in tears of awe."
Could we get earth future in 1 hour?
44:59 I’m sorry what lmao
I love ti!!!!!
i would love a video same kinda length purely about the ediacaran  onwards
The dedication put into this video is overboard. Let alone make a twelve minute video about asteroids is taking 1200+ hours, you are the start to our future kurzgesagt.
Hi!!! I'm a teacher. I showed this video to my students along with a worksheet I made where they had to draw what they saw on the screen. They enjoyed it. The best part was when life became multicellar and time felt as if it moved faster. The students were like "slow it down!!!!" Thank you guys at Kurzgesagt for all you do :)
find that u'll know I was here 2024
bot i wander if microorganisms can still be created
the fact that live is almost as old as the planet it lives on is crazy
if you're looking for the "it's fake" comments, just know that these people are trolling, it's not worth your time
Do I get a prize for pointing out the glitch at 29:44? ;)  Finding that was just a result of how hypnotizing your video was. Incredible stuff as always!
👁️👁️👄💪🏿💪🏿🌏🌍🌎🌙🌜🌛🌞🌝🦜
🐸♾️🏫🆓😍🏠😡
Hope they make another video like this but for just the last million years. Milestones of humanity would be depicted
I don’t agree with all the science theories but the animation and music is spot on! 😎
Cinema
I have a question about the first eon, wasn't Hades the Greek god of the underworld?
Very concerning how many people actually believe this nonsense….
Dude, finally made it W movie!!!
Hmm, I see video about history of the universe, I click. I see no "NO, THE SUN IS A DEADLY LASER", I click out.
They made millions off this video alone
damn, even 4.5 billion years ago there were sick beats & banger music
this video would make an awesome wallpaper or screensaver
Came for the history, stayed for the funky music 🎶 😮
A couple of years ago the band fatboyslim released a similar video :)
Is the voice spat at 39:45 min? 😂... Great video I lov it.
A WHILE YOU SAY KURZ!!!. I DONT THINK 4512MILLION YEARS IS A WHILE. EVEN A MILLENNIUM IS DEFINITELY NOT A WHILE.😅
Pair this with some coffee and your good to go
I am absolutely blown away by this video. Everything from the music to the animation is fantastic. I would definitely consider this to be in the top 100 essential videos on YouTube.
wow such amazing video from amazing channel on youtube Thank you
This is a beautiful piece of art and science, thank you for allowing us to experience it! I cannot imagine the work that went into it. Major props to everyone involved!
If you spped this up you can do this in no more than 30 mins :-D
"Nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that?" famous last words
the music is so epic bro it made the video a thousand times more entertaining. props!
I find the fact that so many humans all over the world actually watched and appreciate this video quite heartening… gives me hope for the future
Very good, but if the earth was 4.5 billion years old and if you want to take 1.5 million years passing every second it will take 50 min not 1 hour I just know that bc I used a calculator
Very nice, don't blink you'll miss it. Lmao.
This was an INCREDIBLE hour experience!
This could've stood to be a little shorter
Can we just appreciate the absolutely awesome soundtrack?
why does this feel like a livestream
I enjoyed the video and how you showed how Earth looked like when it happened.
so you're telling me that we're all just bacteria with a conscience?
Can someone explain to me where does the Water come from? H2O because there was no O at that time???
4 billion years ago, how did it rained when there was no atmosphere? 😕
"An algae may have invented sex, a big reproductive improvement for many different reasons" - Kurzgesagt 2023
Disappointed!  Did it say how water formed and how huge cavities for rivers, seas & oceans formed?
Great video, but how did life come back again after the Asteroid and how long did it take to return ? and how did first human appear ?
Really puts into perspective, of how fast were evolving. Weve been civilized for about 5000 years, and have discovered a billion times more things than the 4.5 billion years before that.
good content👍🏻
We need more videos like this covering different topics! i have some ideas for it, namely the history of the observable universe and the history of humankind. Great work! hope to see more like this in the future.
This video must have taken not less than 3 to 4 years to complete. Hats off to this channel.
Wow amazing . Love it ❤ ❤  I wish in future i can watch a vr version of it
fukn vibin out
Best Joint of the Week
The bangers in the background are sooooooo good!!!!!!
Much fun 🎉😮
This is the best video I`ve ever seen on Youtube!

Paleoarchean era is so underrated😢
Camera man never diesss!!!!!!!!!😎😎😎
I would pay something for this video if I had a credit card.. Exceptional ❤
I started in haden and busted in rhyacian period 😊
nice music!
Amazing video. I am curious what made rain for so many years continuously to make oceans and cool down the planet earth in making?
this is the perfect video for studying, exactly what I was looking for! I usually go for watching movies while studying but the options arent great on yt, so this is perfect :D
I was here just watching a history lesson, and I ended up staying because the MUSIC WOULDN'T LET ME GO!!!🤘😈👽
98% of the time this video is close to perfect. 99% if you are willing to add Indonesian subtitles for us loyal viewers of Kurzgesagt! ❤
I got a 25 million years unskippable ad 🙄
WOW! Great works guys!!!!
"At this point in time, our sun is 30% less bright than it is today. But there are so many green house gasses that it is still much hot and comfy" (7:12).
“The floor is lava” -a game every child instinctively plays 😮
Lovely ❤
Bs.
"Life is thriving nothing, can go wrong, wait what tha" ded 59:40  Lol
Thanks for putting fun back where it belongs...  Wow.
watched it all in 1 sitting. proud?
Earth had such a killer soundtrack during its formative years. I bet every microorganism was rocking out hard to this music.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool Neanderthals developed tools We built a wall (we built the pyramids) Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries That all started with the big bang (bang) Since the dawn of man is really not that long As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song A fraction of a second and the elements were made The bipeds stood up straight, the dinosaurs all met their fate They tried to leap but they were late And they all died (they froze their asses off) The oceans and Pangea, see ya wouldn't wanna be ya Set in motion by the same big bang It all started with the big bang It's expanding ever outward but one day It will pause and start to go the other way Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang Australopithecus would really have been sick of us Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses) Religion or astronomy (Descartes or Deuteronomy) It all started with the big bang Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology It all started with the big bang It all started with the big bang Boom done
And the history's gonna repeat itself! It feels like we will slowly kill our planet until it looks like what it was 4.5 billion years ago. and I am not even kidding.
The tendency to move goimg wild rn
incredible that I watched the whole think while about to sleep. well done to the animation and overall teams.
I’m bouta get so much hate, but its gotta be said.  FOOLISH VIDEO! What makes people think that the earth is 4.5 billion years old?!? This absurd idea came from Darwin in the 1800s, and it was a HYPOTHESIS! He has SO little evidence to back himself up for “macroevolution” and it NEVER became a scientific fact, it didn’t even become a theory!!  Proof that Jesus Christ is real: Ya’ll know the meaning of Christmas? Probably not, its the celebration of Jesus’ birth.  Anybody know the meaning of Easter? Its the day Jesus Christ died on the cross for the entire world. ALSO, who would put a good friday before a holiday? Because its a three day holiday, good friday is the day Jesus died, and Easter sunday is the day Jesus rose from the dead.  Noah’s Ark has literally been found. Guess where? Exactly where the Bible says it was.  The Ark of the Covenant has been found. You guessed it, right where the Bible said it was.  Landmarks of the Bible are still here today.  Everything the Bible says IS COMING TRUE!!  Why is Christianity the most hated religion in the entire world? Because thats the religion the devil hates because it is the only true religion.  People around the world have seen angels AND demons.   Jesus has been seen walking in the sky.  I myself have experienced Gods Glorious presence.  Now, go read ANY scientific book, and read how all the organisms function, and ecosystems function, how EVERY SINGLE THING IS DONE SO PERFECTLY to allow life to live forever on this earth. Do you people really think that all THAT, could happen at the PERFECT time and the PERFECT place in one measly tiny chance?? Does anybody ever think to question things they hear? Go ahead, do some research for yourself and question my facts, I’M BEGGIN YOU TO QUESTION ME AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. This is a literally matter of a life and death, whether you could live in heaven FOREVER, or die spiritually. Its up to you.   If you have made it this far reading, you have already done what 90% of the population couldn’t do, seriously! So please take the things I’ve said into consideration, just give God a chance, and you will truly see how wonderful he is, he will only show his glorious miracles and love if you invite, because he does not force himself on you. Take care!
In a nutshell should be a school system
I thought the soundtrack was by The Ocean Collective (it's a compliment)
This is boring to watch. Why does it have to be 1 hour. Pls just make a 1minute version of something
interesting
Incredible 😢
you missed the part where God created earth
This is very interesting, this must have been how the earth was form years ago.
This is AMAZING! Thank you Kurzgesagt...
all this to say humanity isn't a blink in history
It would be cool to see the atmospheric temperature throughout these periods as well
this is such a lovely project💕 thank you so much to everyone who made this happens🎉
Video is a masterpiece. Thank you for sharing this with us
19:16 how ? then what is the water made of ?
The earth is just full of lava now is full of water?
The amount of time that it took to create the video, and the colors! Even used color theory! Kurzges agt gotta be one of my favorite science channel of all time.
37:07 mind elaborating what that is?
Lovely graphics 🥰
It is very dreadful that humanity just happened at the last second but has enough power to create the 6th mass extinction
Great job !
It took an hour for earth to get us here today. Dont let us destroy it within a fraction of a millisecond
Wait if billions of years have passed why is it 2024
And religious people will still say the earth is not this old😭
This content is amazing!! Best video I saw in long time!
someone get the camera man to the hospital abile to stand on lava to survive a lighting strike and a metor is insane but bro aint letting go of that camera the camera is his life support take it away he falls ded🤣🤣🤣
After watching this i can say Religion makes far more sense then these baseless theories with zero proofs that some lighting make cell to mutate or evolve then became fish then monkey then human .. How can someone believe in this type of stupid stuff? 😂😂 They call someone who believe in religion are not intelligent and believe in fairytales 😂😂
cool
I knoew there were millions of years old rains, but...self-sustaining naturally ocurring nuclear explosions? 37:10  Gorgeous video with awesome music btw
For immersion, watch this in 0.25x
The fact that someone may continue on this video for an another hour after a few million years from this day describing human lifeforms so primitive and short-lived ☠️
Wow it took me half a billion years to finish pooping
amazing work, i watched this in one sitting.
All I could say is, the team of Kurzgesagt is AMAZING! That's it, falling short of words. Thank you for so much of information!
God created the earth and everything.  This is fake news. I mean he did it all, created all, and even took a day off.
It's incomprehensible to me how humans have only made up the tiniest tiniest fraction of Earth's history. We never actually learn in school how long it is before humans and even singular celled organisms came to exist. this video really helps put everything into perspective
THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED
😊😊😊😊😊
the great oxidation event is widely considered the first extinction level event. a change of that magnitude would have wiped out most of what life existed as the chemical make up of the water and atmosphere changes. this video is only brushing over these events. so much info is missing.
Honestly, the jam though. Put that shit on Spotify
Great video, as always. Would be nice to make a projection video of the next 4.5 billion years next.
How does it rain when there’s no water to rain
Do One Piece in 1 minute
I thought humanity was doomed but then i saw this comment section and man, people know art when they see it . . . Maybe we're not so bad after all granted we are no more than a blink of an eye in the vast history of earth😅
This is amazing.  I’m going to watch this while on the treadmill and really contemplate my existence for an hour lol
Floor is lava for ever 2:17
this the best music during Eoarchean i ever heard
this was so cool
save the vaquita the have 10 in the world and the are tiny dolph
as you can see climate always changed
"It probably rains for millions of years" rain requires clouds with water in them. So how did they get enough water to rain for millions of years? Rain is part of the cycle of water, clouds don't just appear out of no where and generate enough water to fill oceans.
That was some wild fun! The soundtrack was fire, and the plot felt like a thriller, waiting for that juicy twist.
The human era is closer to about 200,000-300,000 years but would still be only a fraction of a second for this video.
I haven't felt this emotional even while watching things that are supposed to be emotional..
We want the soundtrack on Spotify !!!
OK, this video should be a compulsory lesson in schools!
Real time is when I put the video on pause..
Where does the initial rain come from?   Was their oxygen at this time?   I didn’t think so
the fact that they went to all of this effort, meanwhile none of it is true is just sad. like dude everyone knows the world is six thousand years old and not billions XD
Happy 10th anniversary Kurzgesagt!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Soundtrack is full of bangers oh my lord
The last 3 minutes summarise everything that we know about evolution 😂
The fact that even if watch this video at 0.25 speed it still passes .25 million years per second.
Its not true
Meanwhile watching I was playing w my yo yo and I did my first dna
Now make a real time version lol
I like his show
why doesn't you tube have rewind and forward by 10 seconds feature...aah it does. .....UPDATE AFTER GOOGLING Keyboard J (back 10) and L (forward 10) Keyboard Arrow Left (back 5) Arrow Right (forward 5)
59:40, He jinxed it.
Me commenting 0:00 so I can go back to the start
I wonder how stoned everyone watching this vid is right now
The music is hella annoying holy shit
And do fungi things…. 🤣🤣
off the🍄 enjoying it
The music in this is god-tier.
Enlightening and freeing.  Thanks for the video.
This made me very emotional, just beautiful
man I got so emotional during the cretaceous. Beautiful animation, beautiful video, I love hearing about the history of our earth even though I already know it, much like most people here.
🎶 A billion years can seem a stunningly short time… 🎶
I just want to say , love your channel . Keep growing and keep bringing these amazing videos for all of us people who are interested in space and physics . Thank you 🙏
The Hadean era music goes so hard
hi im new to Kurzgesagt
Bloxfruit player waiting for the new update be like:
I'm LOVING to study with this video on the background. Thank you Kurzgesagt!!! <3
4.8 Billion years later ha ha!!!
The ending had me in tears.
"So you see your honor, from my point of view we ALL are underage"
How long it would take the average Joe to catch up with Bezos wealth if he makes the average salary:
USA 7th.  There's nothing going on in the US on that date.
Mick Gordon called, he wants his music back.
Thank you so much for the time and effort, it really helped me understand 4.5 billion years at the age of 15!
Hi, I have a doubt; in approximation, how big would the hydrothermal vents have been?
TF2 players waiting for valve to update Team fortress 2:
This is my go-to study video
where does God come in all this and religion since god made earth 6000 years ago?
“The oxygen reacts to make co2 and water, cooling the planet down” We need to go back in time and grab some of this logic-defying co2, and have it replace the stuff we have now. Global warming solved 😎
Longest beats set in history
Athiesm lore is awesome I really cant believe how the devs imangined all that lol
You forgot the day i was born😢😢
Amazing 🤩 😮
fiction
Awesome animation! Thanks for the effort. Really puts things into perspective.
Another crazy fact the light we see from the sun was created when the dinosaurs were around. That’s how dense the sun is, light takes 100 million years to escape and then only 8 minutes to reach earth
One of the best and amazing videos on YouTube!
How do researchers even figure this out?!
The floor is lava is an age old game that has been played since the beginning of time
Make it for Spanish channel please!
Way too drawn out
Wow
W in the chat for kurgesagt for this movie!!!!!
W in the chat for kurgesagt for this movie!!!!!
I love how you kept the time ratio aspect <3 respect
The comment from Jurassic Park- made me almost spit out my tea!  Loved the whole thing!
all lies all guess...unless this guy was there 4.5 billion years ago in person and used his cell phone took pics and vids of the events...thats why his telling us right now that this happened....4.5 billion years ago cause he was there.
the sound design in this fixed something in my brain, so incredible
There's so many talented people on this team it felt like those credits lasted longer than ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY
music name?
*BUT WHERE ARE THE HUMANS?!?!* ☹️
nah, i’m pretty sure it started more like “In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth
Isn’t it crazy to think about how the music would’ve sounded to humans at the normal scale
It’s insane that the time it took you to watch this video was 0.0000000678 seconds in this scale
I love how in the beginning over 100 million years it’s hard to see progression, but then at the end it’s so fast paced
This is sooooo good
Found you guys through PKA on Woodysgamertag and the Channel is great! Earned a sub
God did
58:54 is so beautiful
The Mesoarchean is one of the best, who’s with me
Nice
Background audio like playing 2D videogame ..🤤
The rain part has no logical reason at all
Im mostly bored of anything about history but I was actually interested and intrigued that I didnt even skip or 10 second skipped anything.
I have so many questions. I feel like a child 😊
I watched eveything and wow what an amazing video. Props to the whole Kurzgesagt team for this piece or art.
AMAAAZING!
This is poggers
Watching this video makes me really appreciate life, we are the pioneers of humanity right now if humanity gets to live as long as the dinosaurs.
You don't talk or give nearly enough information. You don't need 2 minutes of silence showing us the rain creat the oceans, that could of been a smaller segment or at least talked over with some facts/history
Wrong.
Stopped at 23:15
Thanks for the video.
the landscape❤‍🔥 the music❤ narrator ❤
This video made me realize that if we want to move all the human to another planet and that we could move 1,5 million humans each year, it would take 3600 years to move juste 4,5 billions out of the 8 billions we are...
U sound like Peppa pig's storyteller
9:08 rains but how? Was the water not brought by the asteroids?
for a better idea of how long this is, make sure to set the playback speed to 0.000000000007716x
Insane free content. Very enjoyable to watch, kudos to the developers
58:38
Don't blink or you might miss all of human history. 😂
29:45 look at the bottom of the vid
Made me know all the night knowledge
This is called 4.5 billion years of binge watching
The best update 45:00
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Lmao. 55:50 things start to diversify. Almost the entire tineline is bereft of complicated life. Our time period is so tiny too....crazy to think of all the weird things we accomplished. How is it that our brains are so advanced compared to everything else?
What feats will humanity achieve if given the duration of life that the dinosaurs had? Maybe amazing things, maybe galaxy spanning things. Maybe just as much of a history will be left of us as is the dinosaurs, bones, and dust. Only time will tell, and only others will ever know.
Hi you're on a rock floating in space
Absolutely brilliant. A masterpiece.
Wow
At around 26:24 I think I spotted my great(to the 3783rd) grandma
It was actually pretty boring
I've studied with this video in the background many times. It is an amazing video and I love the music!
It feels like half the time the earth was trying to stop life from happening
Thats some good nonsense goodd job
Today, on Kurzgesagt we will show you video that is boring and interesting at the same time
8:05 sooo where from does rain come on our(?) lava planet?
amazing video. it shows how beautiful life truly is
18:51
dang
It's amazing how Kurzgesagt successfully managed to fit 4.5 billion years of human history into 1 hour. As a christian it solidifies the fact that God really was flexing when he created the universe in only 6 days😂🙌. Great job @kurzgesagt!
The animation is top notch and is very worth while but more people need to be talking about some of the music in this.
future history of earth might be an interesting video
💃  🕺
Loved every million years of it!
from Hadeans to Gaians:  1,000 million years ago (mya) (magnetism/sexual reproduction); 500 mya (plant life-trapezoid); 200 mya (dinasours-pentacle ⭐); 40 mya (mammals-heart ❤) and 20 mya human ape starts its journey.....may the force of light-life be with us, rainbow 🌈 danke
Da heck? 29:42

gud job bro keep up da work [also like and sub] thank you
Am I the only one that thinks the neoarchian era sounds like some terraria ah music
Perfect sleep aid
Thank you for this phenomenal experience , dear Kurzgesagt team,
With one press of the right arrow you skip 15000000000 years
I love you Also, welcome to Costco. 😁  Seriously, THANK YOU.   And to the rest of humanity; Did you see all those mass extinction events. Time we stop funding wars and start funding the space program(s)  Yes, we can call ot a "war on extinction" if you want... 😮‍💨  [Has come to the conclusion tha I am preaching to the choir.  Like 70%+ of the people who watched this video, and then chose to engage with it's comments, are probably not the people I need to convince. Apologies.]
9:35
Space Night music:3
The Cameraman : 🗿🗿🗿🗿
Incredible video, the music is amazing
Bro, having a grasp on 4.5 Billion years is a piece of cake. "Time" & "Space" are unique to our dimension, that's why we can't grasp the true "math" and "predictability" surrounding Quantum Mechanics
me using this for amazon
Unbelievable thanks for the efforts.
I like the video so much! I watched it 11 times
Awesome video! 🎉 . Can you pls make an all of mars or Venus history in one hour. That would be very cool to see
props to the cell that invented sex
I like the music in this. Pretty trippy and chill
Great video but I have one question you jumped straight into planet formimg and rain but without one mention of atmosphere pressure or even our gravitational pull and I'm only 15 mins in but I'm starting to feel like if you haven't taken the moon into account and pls don't get me started on how important the moon is........, I feel a bit of a gap 😅.# watch more and you don't explain half of how the planet formed😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had to put this on. 4x Speed if you don't know how to do that, go to the setting.Put it on two times speed then hold on your screen
We need wallpaper of this ☝️
I'm actually god and I really miss the Mesoarchean days. Those were the years I was really finding myself.
Anyone watching this video stoned?
I absolutely want more videos like this on youtube!! Does anyone know more of these types of videos?
if you sold all the music from ll your episodes, on vinyl, I would buy the whole collection
I watched it like 20 times. Listening it right now while I work. Awesome work @kurzgesagt!
Decent video but you could make one better focused on evolution of life only with better graphics of the animals
34 million years ago, "We are almost home" sounds amazing and incredible.....
I LOVE Kurzgesagt. this is so great !!!!
hot-tub ocean sounds so nice
I blinked and I missed the whole Jurassic period 😭
As long as the possibly billions of years it took to create this planet, is as short(er) us humans existed to potentially destroy it. 1:00:39-1:00:44 Darn. I blinked!  😅
Watching this in the year 34:02?😉
Where's the asteroid☄ 33:52 (59:47)?
45:04 LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Music at the 1st 3 minutes... ...then @3:50, 16:41, 35:15...🥁 ...DROPS THE BEAT❕
it's like a dance track
This was a deeply emotional and humbling experience. Thank you!
Honestly one of the best studying videos on the internet
Music goes hard
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how absolutely banging the music is though! 😎🙌
Amazing tune 35:46 ❤❤❤❤
after one more hour, it's time to say goodbye to the Sun

You were making this video for 5 years? You guys could have made an anime instead 😏😏😏
I find this video very grounding when overwhelmed. I love the music and the visuals, and I also find it oddly calming that the entire length of my life is extremely short on a geological level.
Wow, we are nothing
It’s awesome to see the eons/eras of the planet 🌎🌍🌏.
I’m making a paper copy by pencil✏📝I also watch it just for fun 🤩🤩 so I love ❤ this video thank you.
Can you make a video about the next 4,5 billion years in the future?
Who just satt and watched it all in one sitting  👇
This is one of the greatest YouTube educational animated videos I have ever witnessed. Thank you for this.
Two years ago I found about this amazing channel and I decided to watch every single videos from 10 years ago, today I finished watching every single videos of Kurzgesagt.
45:05 no context
That's just a great work again, thank you team! :)
Just used this to study for a teaching exam! Thank youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
Goated video made by a goated editor of a goated channel  It cant get better than this
1:49 you can see a tooth shaped rock?
Basically ASMR
Does anyone know where to find the song that plays Permian and onward? Its not on the album for some reason, but its beautiful.
It's crazy how short the dinosaurs lasted  on the geological timescale. It felt like a split moment, and they were gone.
“The floor is lava” taken wayy too seriously 💀 1:33
45:00 GUYS ITS THE SEX UPDATE WOOOO
turn to Christ❤😊❤😊
It's crazy how microorganisms first lived like a billion years ago
1 like =1 push
55:50 !!!! That song I love
🙌🙌🙌
People who watched it all the way to the end ⬇️⬇️⬇️❤❤❤
why do bubbles take millions of years to get to the surface in siderian
Damn watching this made me so emotional, we’re actually so insignificant in the grand scheme of things and it’s making me want to appreciate the life I have more because like the narrator said, we might miss all of human history if we blink, aka if we don’t stop and appreciate our lives it might just past in a second before we even realise it.
39:58 face?
All lies. Earth is flat
Ok damnnnn music poppin off ! Ty love it
Nothing major happened in the Stenian ... except for the invention of sex.
1:38 “…the floor is lava!”
The fact that nothing is sped up or slowed down makes this so powerful.  It shows, that any sort of notion that the Earth was made for us, is wrong. Planet Earth's been "empty" and dead for hundreds of millions of years, and could have very well remained so. It would have still been a magnificent thing all on it's own. Life really is just a lucky copassenger. And humans... to Earth we are nothing but another visitor. A short-term tenant.
although what he said, i could've just left this as the background and done something else, I accidentally just reached the peak of my concentration level watching this whole video haha.
54:01-54:12 How did it take 11 million years to travel that distance?
I feel sad that you had to animate     that
oh my gosh, I've never been so hooked with music only (mostly) video!!! This animation is superb, gosh! Started in 2019? Owemji, kudos! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
oh my gosh, I've never been so hooked with music only (mostly) video!!! This animation is superb, gosh! Started in 2019? Owemji, Kudos! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

29:37 "All the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and water, which "rapidly" (millions of years) cools the planet down." Finally a science channel that explains that CO2 and water vapour can also be responsible for cooling the planet and not just warming it, which is exactly what will happen in due time, not to mention polar periods due to movement of the earth's axis etc. The planet doesn't care if we're screwed first. It will recover.
good tip for the next time, rather than animating 4 billion years and speeding it up, you can just make 1 hour video directly
This was super cool! I'm surprised there's not more stuff like this
It out stands me that intelligent life didn't evolve in the dinosaurs there was so mcuh time compared to us mammals
Me when I watch this dude vids "yeh this is brig Bain time
This whole video is 100% LIES. God created the world and everything in it. And the earth is approximately 6500-7000 years old.
🎵 *lo-fi history to relax or study to* 🎶
Diggin the porn music
2229 Million Years Ago : Linndrum is invented
Thank you kurzgesagt, for letting us see our beautiful beautiful earth!
What an incredible video
God: I''m gonna need seven days Kurzgesagt: Hold my beer
Is the whole set by music mountain? Pls give me a name to this massive multi million years set! Phenomenal
omg, earth is so OLDDDDD, it's crazy!!! FASCINATING
Amazing work... 😊😊 Speechless.
1 hour of animating must’ve taken years, the fact that we got this for free is insane
I sat for an hour to watch all your videos, it's so useful
This would be 100% perfect for falling asleep to if the first portion didn’t have an occasional noise like a squeaky sneaker
Where did the massive bombardment at the beginning come from? Was there a belt in our orbit at the time?
Great video but the thea theory is largely rejected present day as the moon very scarcely contains any of the same components that earth does
Masha Allah this gave me chills. And I love how the choir starts as macroscopic life began to emerge. Thank you kurzgesagt for this masterpiece 🩷
past civilizations have come and gone into space
That's amazing! Danke für das absolut krasse Video
Can’t believe my parents went through such conditions just to go to school
4 years in the making, impressive
Don't blink😮👏🥲
Is this all presented as factual information? The video starts off with an unproven theory of the creation of the moon. No disclaimers for theories? How can we differentiate fact from fiction here, or is this all unknown and just an idea? How complex life "may" have evolved, it should say, probably.
Tbh if you're into science and make a TV or Computer, this would make a great screensaver.
Steve Taylor is like the David Attenborough of Kurzgesagt.
PERFECTION ❤
Bill wurtz-all of earth, less detail, 19 mins Kurzgesagt-all of earth, more detail, 1 hr Which one do you take?
Whoooaaa
But still, where did life come from?
This is some fire music, Good Job!
Bill Wurtz would be proud🗿
Pls make all slides of this as an animated background please
Bill wurtz did it first
I tried to play this  video in the background while at work but there's no way I could watch it without appreciating the insane artistry and effort that went into this.
Incredible.... Just incredible
The music 🎵 fly 🙌🏾🔥
Also, these are the 4 eras. 0:51 - 53:35 Precambrian 53:35 - 56:43 Palezoic 56:43 - 59:48 Mesozoic 59:48 - 1:00:38 Cenozoic
He currently said “In the” 9 times. 😂
That was truely epic! Great work and kudos to the producers. 💓
If 1.5 million (1,500,000) years pass every second in this hour, then every time you blink (which lasts ~100 milliseconds or a tenth of a second), 150,000 years pass. More than 10 times the length of recorded history goes by every time you blink in this video.
is this an album
Do not wish for immortality
Weelll, this could be very well false too, on bennu, amino acids were found indicating the building blocks of life could be coming from asteroids and same with water, the oort cloud says it all, the normal theory is very likely to be true but the asteroids are certainly responsible too, they might have even brought bacteria to earth
Talk more!! Give fun facts, pleaase
No one will say this is a lie, this is a masterpeice
It's amazing ❤
Thanks for creating such an exceptional history of us
Earth didn't even notice our presence here. Incredible how mankind is changinig everything so quickly - million times faster than normal...
1 hour of excellent information and creativity
This is still my favorite video! It must’ve taken forever to finish between the animation, the music, and the research. Thanks for all the hard work!
Why does the Mesoarchean soundtrack have such "The Only Thing They Fear is You" from "DOOM Eternal" vibes? What was REALLY going on back then?! 😱
An hour well spent ❤️. Thank you Kurzgesagt ☺️☺️
The fact that humans were born around 2 million years ago and Kurzgesagt was made in 2013 shows the level that science has gone to, to figure out Earth's history, is just astonishing.  Also, animating is Top-tier.
This is beautiful.
45:01 the algae name DOES make sense
I think it's cute we still name things after Greek gods just to keep the trend going
1:37  "At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2 *and the floor is lava*"
This art style is beautiful! I love this video so much words can’t express it. Things like this is what interested me as a child and got me into biology.
Total b.s. lol
On this scale 1 second = approximately 1,250,000 years
Nobody can prove that the earth is 4.5 Million years old
This video truly shows how mind-bogglingly ancient life is on Earth. Eons went on before there EVEN WAS any life. Then MORE eons go on with life only being microscopic. Finally, near the end, plants n' animals "suddenly" evolve. Even the dinosaurs are relatively recent. ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY is just a blip at the end.  Gee, how short is an individual human life? Now I am REALLY DEPRESSED! 😮😢😮
59:51 The astroid is called “Chixiclub Impactor”
The ads took me over 60 Million years.
Seriously, reuploaded this amazing video but without music, I'm sure a lot of people will be interested to use the video for a daily meditation ( Me include) and if We wanted music we could put our personal music add it.  THANKS KURZGESASGT, I'm a really big fan of this chanel.
“Good job if you’re still watching” HOW COULD I NOT BE WITH THIS PIECE OF ART
You should do next 5 Billion years from now too
Just amazing 👍
I'm sure someone else has brought it up but the idea that life 'might have' started at hydrothermal vents is generally *not* accepted as a potentiality. There are several stages from 'primordial soup' to 'single-celled life' that would require the interaction of UV light that couldn't physically be present at the hydrothermal vents.
I would have preferred it without the "glory" music to elicit feelings.   Does our ego need that?  Kinda childish,, although it does seem a lot of commenters are young.  Still,  you've done a fab job,  i was engrossed 😂
Mesoarchean? More like Mickgordonean, amirite guys
This is just one long Tool music video. 😂
The music is stunning.
As a geologist, I really like how this video just intuitively gives a grasp on geological timescales
We dont appear until last second,, Damn We really should take care of this planet which has evolved over so many problems and challenges,,, we are lucky to be most evolved species which are born after so many evolution.
PLEASE release a version without narration! I love this in the background to work/study, but the talking can get distracting
Came here to look for the comment saying that something created all this in 6 days and then rested on the 7th. lol  So glad I have not stumbled on it yet.
5:40 isnt that the late heavy bombardment???
45:03 sex
The fact that this video is 1 hour long and still such good quality definetly shows the dedication of Kurzgesagt.
Hoy es 2p de marzo
bill wurtz did it in 20 mins
Mesoarchean era’s audio has to be a meshuggah tribute (sounds like the big drop in Lethargica)
Just get avengers characters in between and boom thats another 1billion dollars grossing movie
I know this isn't part of the "video" but I'd love a one or more hour version of the music in the credits!
I bet whoever wrote the music of the Tonian is a fan of Ecco the Dolphin.
Fantastic work, Kurzgesagt. Over the years, your educational content has kept me informed and emotionally well-balanced. Thank you for this passion project. I hope to see another in the near future.
Imagine listening to this awful music for 4.5 billion years !!😢
I thought earth is only like 2000 yrs old though
cool
This is the best thing I have ever seen on this platform Holy shit
Props to the cameraman who filmed 4.5 billion years of history for free
I bought the soundtrack for this on Bandcamp. Unfortunately for some reason it's incomplete? About 47 minutes instead of the full hour.
nice!
proof or it didn't happen
This could make a good pc wallpaper and by the time you reach the modern period you should take a break
A whole movie 🍿! Thank you
I swear if a religious person tells us “oh this is wrong” I will shush then. Btw I’m not atheist I just think this is how the universe was made😊
I would like to kiss the guy who voices kurzgesagt
You used to make good videos
nice dj set
This is an absolute BOP
That much work put into this and it only felt like 10 minutes, the music was amazing too and the vid was overall really relaxing and great.
An absolute masterpiece! Wonderful work! I play this video all the time when I am studying or doing work around the house. The one-hour time is sooo effective in highlighting the vast amount of time of the geological formation of the Earth as we know it and the incredible rate at which complex life appeared which lead to our arrival. I am always struck with melancholy when the video reaches its end as it feels like the end of an incredible adventure. My sincere heartfelt gratitude to the creators.
bang kok komentrnya english semuah
Love all your videos, but this one is absolute art.
So iv been dead forever and decided to be born in 1984 (mum your the best rip hope you have gone to a better place because you are owed it what you done ✅ ) when Arnold swaznegger made terminator 1 now 2024 and felt I haven’t even lived all I did is help others majority of my life and haven’t got much to show for it got £6 to my name got to do something to make up for lost time
These camera man comments r killing me 😂
And 3 minutes
I love everything about this.
Jesus is coming back. Believe He died for your sins and rose again then repent to be saved.For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God [acknowledge Him to His honor and to His praise].
28:41: ❄️ The Great Oxidation Event leads to the freezing of the planet and the beginning of multiple ice ages. 53:44: 🌍 The video discusses the evolution of life on Earth, including mass extinctions and the emergence of new species.
After the Mesoarchean period i want to play Prince of Persia again
i have insomnia and this has been good company lol
the bgm is underrated
I love how it sounds like he’s just saying little fun facts to make it interesting. Great video btw
will we even be here long enough to be considered a blip in the timeline?.. i hope so
how slowly everything changes initially really makes you think about how drastically fast humans have altered the environment- its not meant to change that fast!
am a biggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg fan of you and i have all mecrh
good musec
8:03 4 billion yrs left *hadean* 14:37 3.5 billion yrs left *paleoarchean* 21:12  3 billion yrs left *Mesoarchean 27:47 2.5 billion yrs left *Neoarchean-Siderian*
𝚐𝚘𝚘𝚍 𝚟𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚘 𝚔𝚎𝚎𝚙 𝚒𝚝 𝚞𝚙
Just wow that is epic
I watched this in 30mins........x2 speed😂😂
Can’t wait until 500 million years has passed so we get 5 billion years in 1.5 hours.  Lol
Where did the water come from? When it started raining? Did it come from asteroids? Was it already on earth? If the planet was so hot and lava covered the surface, wouldn’t carbon just dominate the atmosphere. Making it impossible for oxygen and hydrogen to survive? Wouldn’t it all just spray into space. Someone explaaaaain. Thank you.
Im sad we don't know how life formed, and we may never know.
GOD has a plan for everything…I’m just along for the ride
{هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ}
Amazing video!!!
The music at the end was so fitting. This is the best video on youtube so far
This is inspired by bill wurtz
one of the most amazing videos on the internet😊
Best thumbnail yet
Really makes you question whether intelligence is a good design.
The music is epic!
Jokes on you, I watched this at 2X speed so that's 4.5 Billion Years in 30 Minutes
59:39 :’( RIP dinobros
mesoarchean got them caveman guitar chugs 🤘🤘
I need this soundtrack
Imagine a silicon based cell formed during the Eoarchean era only to be wiped out by one of the meteors.
here's an interesting video idea do a video where if the dinosaurs weren't wiped out how they would have evolved and if they would eventually build computers like us? Or what else would they have been able to do interesting thought
and people pout over a heartbreak 💀
I thought it was 2024 - but no - its 4500000000
Estupendo!
I used this video while studying. I wasn't feeling like studying, i kept procrastinating so I needed some sort of stimulation while I study, And it really helped. I kept both music and video on while studying boring botany stuff, I often looked at video while memorizing things in my mind because the video is calming and not distracting and of course music was really good too.
The Mesoarchean soundtrack bassline sounds like Swedish death metal band Meshuggah, lol.
Wow I still can't believe how complex the evolution of the earth is!! This helped me with my science results in school. I got the highest marks in my year.Thanks a lot Kurzgesagt!!!
Could we get one of the history of everything in the universe in this style, please.
qué precioso! tremendo trabajo!!!!
Bill Wurtz has been real quiet since this dropped
You won't believe the amount of replays I will do on this amazing video with amazing beats!
Is there lava waves back when Hadean era?
Why is this making me cry
I've watched it for 5 min and it's already a masterpiece
What is this animated on? This art style is awesome
Evolution is a lie
🤯
Can't believe Earth was like this 1 hour ago
This is perfect for having in the background when studying, anyone know any other videos with this vibe?
Where is the "Thanks to the cameraman" comment?
This is fantastic! The animation, music, and content, of course
8:43  that means we're actually aliens. If everything was bombarded on earth from space.
Love the BGM, WHERE CAN I Find IT. 🥹 PLEASE
So all the planets collide with an earth like object? All have moons.
The Stenian period has no right going that hard
15:28 is where i left off
The best substitute teacher of all time.  "Today, I will play an hour Kurzgesagt video, which is more educational than anything I can teach you in an hour.  Enjoy."
Easily one of my favorite Kurzgesagt videos to date. Truly thought provoking. We have only been here for a unbelievably miniscule amount of time, but it FEELS so long. Perspective is everything when observing the world around us. Thank you for this masterpiece! Sincerely! <3
Wow happy 420 million years ago
so well done steve! this was so cool and fun to watch im writing down the eras and stuff that you said that happend in the era's *sorry i'm not good at typing* but still good job!
Kurzgesagt and ted ed...ted ed and kurzgesagt....
Cool
Is somebody else listening in his head Right here Right now by Fatboy Slim?
I like it but most of it is just the earth spinning and showing us the perspective
I like it but most of it is just the earth spinning and showing us the perspective
W watch well faded
Would hit more different if this was actually how it happened.
this shit is a movie
Kudos to your video! But I would prefer Bill Wurtz “History of the entire world, I guess” video. Still, you both did good jobs at entertaining people while giving them information about our world’s history.
Perfect 😍😍😍😍
Imagine NOT believing any of this happened. I'm looking at half the comments on most history of the earth videos.
I can just imagine the time effort and patience gone into this video. Truly incredible!! Congratulations to everyone
Imagine this as a 4.5km long mural along a wall by a highway where each meter represents one million years.
whoa this is the longest video you've done!
I feel like I’ve wasted 4 billion years of my life watching this. This really should have been a 3  minute vid.
brilliant 👏👏🙌
I’m four minutes in… is this going to be a real-time video?
Ok… I’m going to give you a shot. But you better start with simple elements becoming single-celled organisms and end with people…. and you better explain how we descended from apes, yet, there are still apes… and politicians.
While watching, I kept reminding myself that 1 second is actually 1.5 million years! So many years that just seem like nothing happened.
Sounds like the narrative from the game humankind
i have trouble falling asleep due to anxiety, like everyone. this helped a lot, but also gave me an existential crises. win win? edit: if anyone involved with this channel reads this, i really appreciate all you do. congrats
Not to brag or anything, but I actually live on Earth.
The music in this was great.. like a mix of Deadmau5 and Tool/Periphery
May i please have a genre to search for this kind of music? It is AWESOME to help focus
It bring me Joy that there’s a channel that can bring people who have endless curiosity together. The fact that there are still people with an attention span longer than 15 seconds is also, the cherry on top 🍒
"Earth Hour - Untilnow"  Watching this earth from a telescope of a traveller at the distance from where I see earth taking 4.5 billion rotations around a bright star and yet almost miss Humanity in utter humbleness..! Entire history in an hour..! And of course, without blinking..! Truly great project for the anniversary.! Kudos Team..! ♥️
watched the whole thing. love it !
Soundtrack 🤌
I love learning new things like this <3 makes me feel more intelligent
59:47 the end
This Sediments track (in Mesoarchean section) is insanely good
31:39 this music is a banger.
love you guys <3
I took me for 10 million years to comment this
J'a dor té vidéo je suis abonnés a toute té chênes
In the Permian segment you said thanks Volcanos but you didn't mention the Crater in Antarctica that is approximately 252 Million years old
yes, it’s good
Now do all of earth according to religion
I was there when the floor was lava. Trust.
Here where Nerds gathers..
As a Geologist, I have to say great job. But the way you used the time scale is very specific? It usually is used in a broader context, like the Archean is usually just the Archean, not the neoarchean or so on when being taught. Maybe you wanted to give a thorough examination or thought a broader context would take too long, but yeah, usually we just talk about the general time groups unless it’s more recent and then we will use epochs. I was very happy when you pointed out certain things though! Thank you so much for doing this!
The stenian era had a lot going on 😉
I don't know what to say! It was just fabolous! Thank you! It's mind blowing how old the Earth is and mind blowing you did this video!
Ok now from where did the rain come from?
I couldn’t hold it in, when the cabrian came, I started cambrianing all over the place
The music during the neoarchean period is giving me Oxygen Not Included vibes.  Great video!  Really gives you the ridiculous scale of the timeline of our planet in regard to us as a species.
You know what Kurzgesagt you’ve earned another Patreon member, keep the good work up
Around 4400 million years ago... The beat dropped 😎
Love this video!
Why is there a giant t rex at the beginning of the Triassic?
The spookiest thing is... Why did life start so early???!!!
I could fall asleep to this...
The music is perfect.
This is insane
Great vid! Please add time stamps for people who wsnt to skip to esch stage haha
Do you guys have a video of all of human history?
Could you dub this video into Spanish please?❤
Sit down somewhere quiet and set a timer for one hour. You'd be surprised how long one hour actually is.
BASED CHAD KURZGESAGT
@29:43 did i understood correctly? all the oxygen combines with methane to form CO2 and water, which rapidly cools the planet down ... i thought co2 is a greenhouse gas.
1,5 milion year PER SECOND!!! This time scale is mind-blowing.
The stenian is definitely my favorite for some reason.
🌎❤️❤️
So where was Noah's Arc ....oh wait.
Absolutely wonderful. I'm feeling so many different beautiful feelings that I can't explain through words!
Honestly the best video i saw on YouTube
this feels like ı can play this on background while studying.
This Is INCREDIBLE.
This has been on my “watch later” list ever since it came out and I finally got to it tonight laying in bed before going to sleep and I was not disappointed! Absolutely incredible and such a unique idea to really get us to feel what millions upon millions of years feels like. Amazing work!
why my stupid brain thought the earth is an egg, then the astereoids are the sperm
That was an hour well spent. Amazing video. Thanks for taking the time to make it.
This is cap asl & people believe this smh
I like the Siderian era
if you liked the music, look up the band 'Tool'.
.
Fans of the German Heavy Metal band The Ocean already love this, and are probably playing their songs to this
Couldn’t sit through it boss great vid tho boss
What do you listen to when you study ? ME: well ....
The Hadean Era and Cretaceous through present era's song are my favourite
1:00:09 that made my eyes watery for some reason
God created everything
awesome
"Such a paradise! Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong... Wait, what that? ... Aaaaand an asteroide killed the dinosaurs and most species on Earth. Such a bummer."
This video is extremely relaxing to watch for some reason and I love it.
en español por favor ❤
Disclaimer this is false information don’t believe this fake shit
But were tf came that water from
human life is less than half a second in a 1 hour video
Bravo 👐well made. In a hundred years we may cause a new mass extinction.
Interesting video concept but I wish you would have talked more. The facts you did mention were pretty interesting but so cut short. Wish you would have elaborated more on that and explained more. Would have really improved the video and made it even more valuable
answered my exact question of how long this took to make, amazing such a wonderful experience, thank you <3
He shouldn’t have mentioned sex at 45 minutes
This is my second run of drinking beers 🍻 this shit is amazing
0:00 Earth is 4.5 billion years old, impossible for your brain to truly grasp. So here’s an experiment. Every second around 1.5 million years will pass. You’re on a musical train ride looking out the window passing all of earth history in an hour. Watch as the eons pass, and experience how long s billion years really is. You can have this in the background, study with it, or just enjoy the ride. From time to time, I’ll say a few words. 4.5 billion years ago, right after it was born, earth was a hell of lava. Pretty early in its history, earth collides with a mars sized object called Thea which forms the moon that you now see in the sky. Right now it looks huge in the night sky and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions of years as it orbits further away.   1:07 (4,529 mya) 4.5 billion years ago, we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the Greek God of the underworld.   1:32 (4,496 mya) at this point, the atmosphere is mostly CO2 and the floor is lava. This area of earth’s history is mostly invisible to us because almost none of it is left.  2:06 (4,453 mya) 19 million years have passed. We are still in the lava hell phase. Settle in, this will take a while.  2:48 (4,400 mya) although you wouldn’t think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate there may have been some water around at this time.   6:48 (4,095 mya) during this period of the young solar system, earth and the inner solar system are smashed by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment for several hundred million years.  7:13 (4,065 mya) at this point in time, our sun is 30% less bright than it is today, but there are so many greenhouse gases that it’s still much hot and comfy.   8:16 (3,984 mya) around this time we think life begins to enter the stage. Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything, the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet.  8:37 (3,957 mya) earth continues to cool, and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form covering the still young planet with water.   12:44 (3,645 mya) these hydrothermal vents we’re looking at and where hot minerals emerge, may have been the place where life first developed, but we don’t know.   13:19 (3,600 mya) so much time has passed and we’re entering the  paleoarchean. Most of earth is still underwater, while the first supercontinents are in the making in the depths below. Its days are shorter since the young earth spins faster.   13:43 (3,569 mya) good job if you’re still watching, you’ve witnessed a billion years so far.   17:50 (3,256 mya) from this time in history, we still have stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by microorganisms, among our first real evidence of life on earth. Also life is starting to eat the sun. Photosynthesis might have started as early as around here.   18:36 (3,200 mya) 3.2 billion years ago in the mesoarchean, the era of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin to crush into eachother, pulling and pushing some deep into the earth where they dissolve. The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hot tub. Over 40° Celsius and microbes are expanding everywhere. We don’t have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases so it it really really hot. You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also there’s no oxygen in the atmosphere yet.   23:51 (2,800 mya) 2.8 billion years ago, the neoarchean begins. Earth is still a terribly hostile place but because we finally have proper plate tectonics, more chemicals are mixed from inside the earth, and life can use them to make new things.  24:35 (2,743 mya) some time around here prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonising the planet. Life diversifies more and more. But still after so much time, we only have single cells.  27:46 (2,500 mya) 2.5 billion years ago in the siderian, a massive event is about to begin that will change the planet forever: The Great Oxidation Event. Oxygen burped out by Cyanobacteria reaches the atmosphere in large quantities, paving the way for more complex life.   29:39 (2,358 mya) all the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and water, which rapidly cools the planet down.  30:16 (2,311 mya) probably for the first time ever, the planet freezes over and a period of multiple ice ages begins lasting millions of years.  30:27 (2,300 mya) 2.3 billion years ago the Rhyacian begins.  31:14 (2,237 mya) lots of volcanoes heat up earth and earth unfreezes slowly again. Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the oceans but life quietly puts up resistance and keeps evolving.  33:48 (2,042 mya) some time 2.05 billion years ago in the Orosirian a large asteroid hits Earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on earth.  34:47 (1,968 mya) all over earth great mountain ranges are crushed into existence by early continents with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlântica.   37:00 (1,800 mya) 1.8 billion years ago in the statherian the supercontinent Columbia has formed. And a natural, self sustaining nuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium deposits in the ground.  39:37 (1,600 mya) 1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of Calimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so, the first eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells. One of the most important moments in the history of life. But yes, kind of looks not that impressive. Still, life is only cells.  41:35 (1,450 mya) earths crust thickens and heavy continents form, the oceans become shallower. Also the first fungi-like organisms extend their tubular arms and do fungi things.  42:17 (1,400 mya) some time in the Ectasian 1.4 billion years ago, earths inner core is forming. Weird, right? Feels like it should be older. But around here it begins to solidify into an iron crystal surrounded by hot Liquid Metal. It will only grow from now on.   44:54 (1,200 mya) 1.2 billion years ago in the stenian not that much is going on. Except, the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented s**. A big reproductive improvement for many different reasons.   47:34 (1,000 mya) 1 billion years ago the Tonian begins, another age where earth is rocks puddles and oceans. Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right?  50:08 (800 mya) not everybody is having a great time here. We have evidence that the first unicellular predators emerging around that time. The dominance of bacteria and big boy eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans. An arms race between microbes that again creates huge diversity. Some even invent tiny armour.   51:15 (720 mya) 720 million years ago in the Cryogenian earth freezes over again. Sure why not. How did life survive? We’re not sure.  52:18 (635 mya) 635 million years ago the supercontinent Gondwana forms. A lot of it is still left today!   53:15 Wow! What’s happening? Suddenly life gets big. In a hot second multicellular organisms become widespread! It’s all strange aliens still, but can you imagine that it took that long for this to happen?   53:36 (539 mya) 539 million years ago the Cambrian explosion begins. We see life bursting with variety. Ancestors of almost all of today’s major animal groups appear here while the plants start to discover the land. Life is finally exciting. But of course a big mass extinction happens right after, killing most species in the ocean.  55:00 (430 mya) plants spread over the planet and create the soil on the ground and change the atmosphere by eating CO2.  55:39 (381 mya) things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better to life on land. We get trees and forests, fish and the first vertibrate decide this land thing is something they need to try out!  55:56 (359 mya) 359 million years ago in the Carboniferous forests and lush marshlands are at their peak. They will turn into the coal humanity burns today to keep ourselves warm. It’s all so fast now! Life changes so quickly in geological timeframes!  56:43 (300 mya) some 299 million years ago in the Permian, Pangea the last supercontinent has formed. And after a few tens of millions years, the largest mass extinction in history happens, killing the majority of all species. Thanks volcanoes.   57:23 (252 mya) 252 million years ago the Triassic begins.   57:41 (227 mya) oh hey, a dinosaur!  58:03 (201 mya) we are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere! The ancestors of the birds do bird things. Life, uhh, finds a way!  59:21 (100 mya) earth gets more and more familiar.   59:38 (78 mya) such a paridise. Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong… wait, what’s that?   59:50 (66 mya) and an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on earth. Such a bummer.   59:57 (54 mya) 66 million years ago in the paleogene the continents look roughly the same as today and mammals take over. It is our time now! We are almost home.  1:00:39 (2,600 years ago) Don’t blink or you might miss all of human history!  1:00:45 and at was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. So new. This was a project born of passion.

just aweosme
This video deserves 4.5 billion views and comments too.
hello 3am obsession
it’s not just beautiful, something alters your minds about existing itself there
bill wurtz 19 minutes cryin in the corner
@kurzgesagt now try to make a 30 minute long version of this
This is so cool! Thank you Kurzgesagt team!
Masterpiece.
Dear kurzegast, make Indonesian Subtitle 😢  i've been waiting for 2 years for that thing 😢
Stenian reminds me of Tool.  The drums.🪘
Goes to show how quickly an intelligent species can take over the plan / grow. Imagine other possible intelligent life forms that didn't survive, or those that did but went unrecorded then died at a later date? So much things we don't know, but it sure is amazing to think about.  Thank you for the video!
Das in deutsch wäre der Wahnsinn 😮 ❤❤❤
For any musicians in the comments, try playing the main riff of Phantoms Can't Hang by deadmau5 over the first section, it fits like a glove!
Super!!!!!
This is an amazing video!!! It was a beautiful experience and thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to watch this. Blew my mind. With knowledge and creativity.
Top!!!
At 29:40 in the video an artefact can be seen in the video, this may have been added by conversion to YouTube’s format (bottom of screen)
This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen on YouTube
The most boring video I’ve watched on this channel. 5 seconds of talking then 30 seconds of bad music
now i can say i have watched the best youtube video in one hour
You forgot to say "I guess." Oh wait, 1:00:39 "don't blink or you might miss all of human history" 😂🤣.  This must have taken serious DEVOTION to make. We can only wonder if the researchers or the artists had it harder.  Edit: Happy 10th anniversary(although I'm late), genuinely glad The Infographic Show has less subscribers than you.❤
This is probably a really dumb question but if the days were shorter back then, does that mean our planet isn't really that old? Because time is time, whether it's light or dark. Like, 1 hour is 1 hour. But if days were only like 12 hours or something wouldn't that mean... OMG OK. My 2 brain cells are screaming. Nvm. I thought too hard already. Lol. I guess my question is, how would that fact affect how old our planet is?
This is wonderful.
wait a second, this comment technically took millions of years to write-
Love this, thank you!
4 billion years ago and no traces of evidence, yet we are able to simulate visuals...   The power of human imagination beats my imagination.
Use Occam's Razor here, it's more likely that a supreme intelligence created life. The complexity of life and the sheer distinctiveness of it compared to dead matter is good enough cause to belive in God. until someone can provide a reasonable argument to disprove God then it should be our current model.
It's difficult to put into words what a blessing this channel is to educational youtube. Such graspable explanations of really complex topics, along with mesmerizing music and stunning visuals. It really does feel like a premium service I should be paying for. I love this channel so much!
This is awesomeeeeeeee
Respect to the camera men for recording this for 4.5 billion years whilst enduring the harsh environtment...
lol mammals are barely a minute old
3:47 BEAT GOES HARD ASFFFFFFFF WHOEVER WAS IN THAT STUDIO WAS COOKIIN 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Masterpiece! 🌵
when you're studying and you just hear "also, organisms have started eating the sun"  Allllsosooooooo..... If photosynthesis is eating light, what would you call eating math/science/nerdiness? Because this video, physics, chemistry and math are what keeps me alive (:
I love this so much, the earth's history is true sad. Btw make more videos about this Kurzgesagt!
❤
Loved the music
so where did the life forms come from? were they transported here via water, or do they exist through out the solar system, and only form when the right conditions are met. like when you dry out a seed, and it grows into a plant when introduced to water
This is just incredible. I can''t say anything else, all the respect to you guys!
A masterpiece 4.5 billion years in the making, thank you kurzgesagt !
HAHAHA. Facinating and boring at the same time
Please can you make a ‘history of Earth poster’ based on the ‘4.5 billion years in 1hr’? I think it will be really good.
More or so 6 or 7 thousand years old but it’s fine, I love looking at science history whether it’s Christian Science or naturalistic science, so see just what happened in both.
seeing this for free is a privilege
This video (and the Superior Drummer sound on Mesoarchean era) might have inspired me to create a Technical Death Metal band speaking about the all of these eras. Outstanding video.
Tyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Loved this! great job!
Amazing! Simply Amazing Video
This is sooooooooooooo good!
I need the soundtrack on Spotify
It's honestly kinda crazy to think that life on Earth is so new compared to the planet itsself.
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started Wait The Earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool Neanderthals developed tools, we built a wall (we built the pyramids) Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery That all started with the Big Bang (bang!)
Just breathtakingly awesome. Thank you.
This is insaneeeeeeee 🎉
So nobody will mention the fact water just rained for millions of years just out of the blue? From nowhere? This is something to this day we cannot explain, how the earth has so much water on our surface. Some water will occur from the cooling down and well like they say brought from Asteroids or comet hitting the earth but still nowhere around the amount we have. The only real explanation I could ever come up with is thea that hit earth was a water planet.
The entire history of the world, I suppose
Tha animation is to die for
Don't forget to leave a like and follow
truly amazing :O
If the atmosphere was filled with CO2, where then did the rain come from? There are so many things wrong with this concept you project as earths forming.
words cannot describe how i love this channel
Subscribed after this video! Amazing work
This was great. But i still think "Timelaspse of the Future" by Melodysheep is the best to the end of time video ever.
Great Concept for a video, very cool idea and executed well. However you should have prioritized more facts and information to tell us during the trip, it was kind disappointing seeing 15 minutes of looped animation with nothing going on.
nice fantasy story this is nonsense
This video is already 3 months old. A lot has happened since. When will you post an updated video?
1 hour of animating, this was the best work we’ve seen! ❤
can u make this 10 minutes
so much wasted time and potential. there were so many things that needed more explanation. i watched it all, but i regret it. there is nothing new or interesting in it. just music some mediocre ilustrations. where did all the water that fell on earth came and made it rain for half billion years and a lot of other things that could be explained in all the time that was silent. 1h of no real information. very sad.
1:35 "...and the floor is lava."  Thanks for making me spit out my coffee.
did anyone elses school in australia show them a video similar in concept to this but much shorter and centred on making the point that aboriginal people lived in australia for 60,000 years? i cant find that video its driving me crazy
I felt something
Thank you so much for this. Really ❤️❤️❤️
I can't believe people actually believe this.   Isn't it against all scientific fact and theory that something can come from nothing? And if its NOT against scientific fact,  then the reality of God shouldn't be a problem. Because He makes way more sense.  When will people accept that that even with infinite time,  you cant solce the problem of life coming into being.  Yeah.  I'm the one who's crazy.
The instrumentals in this is so good. This channel is like PBS for stoners  I just wanted to say thank you for this. It is both a visual masterpiece and gives a cool beat to “life” to. It’s incredible and I play it during studying for veterinary school. And sometimes I just play it because it’s pretty to look at
it’s kinda funny how i was here for all this
Good choice of music mr K!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thank you for ur hard work take a huge sleep of time and coffee and a lots of delicious food for ur Extream hard work.
Meow
Damn i just have to write something.  THE DEDICATION, ANIMATION, MUSIC, RESEARCH, VA! EVERYTHING IS PERFECT! Happy 10 years anniversary Kurzgesagt!!!!   I'm a bit late but THANKYOU FOR THE FUN EDUCATION THAT U GUYS HAVE PROVIDED!! Wish you guys all the best for future project! Thankyou so much!!!
lol
so relaxing and interesting for a sunday afternoon
Amazing! ❤
LOVE YOU GUYS. Thanks a lot for creating this video.
God is good !

35:16 base drop 🔥🔥
2019?  Screw it, I’m buying the poster
im ngl you're dead capping. and now I wanna box. fair 1.
this is why yall went to graphic design school... to make bs like this lmaoooo
imagine, none of this happened lmaooo

57:01 thanks volcanos !
This is so cool; it would be great to play in a bar or club.
This is awesome, thanks for making it ❤
This made me cry. We come so far to the point that we are able to have a technology to learn about the History of Earth. Million years as a 1 second also feel so unreal cuz human history is even less than 1sec. I can [feel] the difference of time in minutes, days, weeks, months, or 1,10-20years in my perception of time but 100yr,1000yr,1 million or 100 million years are so grand that I can't even imagine.
I loved this! I love paleontology, and this was a great way to pass the time while I did my nails!
A 10 hr loop of the Hadean animation and music would be awesome.
This is an amazing video and really puts into perspective mankind's comparative infancy. Vsauce used a similar concept to this, but on a purely human scale, in his video "Our Narrow Slice". That is great and worth checking out but this is better at showing just how long Earth has been around and how much happened before our time.
Really enjoyed this, always appreciate how few ads there are. Much prefer to hear about your sponsors than mind numbing youtube ads
I think this is the best video I've watched in my life
His Story... 🖖
This is so much better than the Roku screensaver I usually stare  at mindlessly
Super so long time !!!!
Hadean
Well this is nice
Where did rain come from?
That was amazing
The floor is lava
Please we need this video in frencj
watched entirely by the song
This is one of my favorite videos on the internet. I learned so much in my big age about million old history. This honestly should be shown in classrooms everywhere!
WoW!~
To think, this is one hour of 4K video. Huge props to the hard drive
i love this!
Repent and believe Jesus the truth
Thank you for your videos!!
Of all this stages Earth has gone through, it's crazy to think that Humanity formed Earth in such a short time for their needs
perfect video for some background noise while taking a nap if you ask me. love the stuff you do!
very calming to fall asleep to
Bro you worked so hard on this I can tell you deserve some respect time you put in to these creativity just good job
propoganda channel
Damn. That's an insane amount of light years. The whole planetary system is vast—expansive with various discoveries meant to be put out there for even the weakest minded to uncover and appreciate for all its glory.
Thanks for this 1 hour video I learn so much today
Thanks for this 1 hour video I learn so much today
Thanks for this 1 hour video I learn so much today
Thank you very much 🌧️💙
how do people just find this shit out..
The entire human history lasts like half a second in the entire 1 hour video. Gave me goosebumps
This is wonderful!
This was fabulous! Thank you! The music was lovely ❤
School🚫 YouTube ✅
Thank You Very Much 😊🙏🏻
I'm no scientist but as an aquarium enthusiast, in the beginnings of an aquarium when the tank is sterile, you can see so much life competing for the top spot. The water can turn completly green, brown, or purple even. I always imagined once upon a time, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, or some type of algae, ruled the worlds oceans to a point where they would have visually changed what our oceans look like. I try to imagine my aquarium, but on an oceanic scale.
Then God said, let there be genocidal, unethical immoral self destructive beings.
Technically it's prehistory not history
What if the first organism was from those astroids? And we're really aliens 👀
I finally finished watching it. It took almost 3 months to arrive at the end of the video, but definitely worth every minute. Thanks for making this 🙏🏼
This video, music, animation, atmosphere, so dope!
I never thought I'd hear Kurzgesagt say "INVENTED SEX" but that is amazing Thank you so much Kurzgesagt for this video! I appreciate this an undescribable amount!
Thank you. You are amazing. You have given me an overview of this Earth.
I really love this German science animation with it's background musik in techno style
This feels like a remastered take on bill wurtz's "history of the entire earth, i guess" and im all for it!
Oh no! I blinked :l
Dam, an ad 1750 million years ago...
I think whoever did the music is a fan of the band ISIS. If not then they should listen to them. There’s definitely a post rock vibe to some of these songs
It always fascinates me when these massive numbers are put into a comprehensible scale. Nearly an hour long and all of human history fits into about 2 seconds right at the end. We really are so cosmically and chronologically small, and I don't really know how I feel about that...  Thanks so much to everyone at Kurzgesagt for this, must've taken ages.
Fun fact, Scientist think they found Theia in our planet!
such an awesome video
You should do a similar video for human history
I watch it all every minute of this amazing video.  Thank you from my heart to all those involved in the production of this treasure ❤
They don't make music anymore like they did in the Mesoarchean
And you happen to be sitting here watching this video at this very moment, the odds are so infinitesimally small
No tengo palabras para agradecer la excelente calidad del contenido que comparten gratis... y como espero ver pronto este video y muchos más en Español
As a scientist I love how people of the general population just dont get time scales outside of their life experiences... I regularly bet people that T-rex existence was closer to us in time than, T-rex was to Stegasaurus and they say I am a liar.... ha ha ... Dinosaurs were around for a LOOONG time.... 165 Million years... and arguably as birds still are.
Finally asmr video😊
it took me like 75 million years to writes\ this comment and i love it bc its commentary behind my ultrakill gameply
Life is so precious ! Make babies, dont be a genetic dead end !
This is Bullshit Video try trolling people  This is not our 🌎 claim by Atheist  Actually Earth is from 10028 year
This is not our 🌎 claim by Atheist  Actually Earth is from 10028 year
Evidence with Document more detail?, this video is Fake
Most technology we humans use was around for less than 0.003 seconds of this video😂
We humans were only around for 0.2 seconds of this video😂
polyrhythmic music... makes my body dance, I love it.
44:59
This gave me a lot to think about, I'm glad I came to this video and can think about something instead of going on and watching another video
Orosirian, that music is just wow
What if the earth is spinning and the camera is just off the ground.
All of this lead to people stealing from Walmart.
At 1:00:50 humans have to pay taxes. What a time to be alive
Amazing!
not me jumping on my bed as soon as I heard ''and the floor, is lava''
존경스러운 영상입니다. 한국 채널 보다가 본 채널을 보게 되었는데 감명 받았습니다, b
The people who came up with this must've had a time machine or something because there ain't no way someone would know about any of this ever happening I got a better chance at Winning the lottery everyday for the rest of my life and my children's life after that it's just not happening
This is Bs I know it's bs I just wanted to watch and see the Bs being talked about
58:13 is the best part
The fact that in the next few centuries we will start to branch out and settle other planets. All because we lucked out and earth gave us the perfect conditions for life.
thank you soooooooooooooooooooooooooo Mach for doing this
1시간으로 공평하게. 초반부의 지루함까지 줄이지않고. 상대적 시간을 느끼게한게 좋네요.
Thank you so much ❤❤❤
By design.
What? Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee music is so cool. oh, and also, I apologize for all the comments.
Please don’t blink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guys don’t blink you might miss all of humanity
Oh hi Mark, I didn’t expect you to see I didn’t expect to see you here how’s it going?
Hi guys I’m new here
Marks reply is so true
There’s no way that is water
Wow keep up the good work
this video is pretty accurate on how God created Earth.
Why spend an hour watching this when I can listen to Bill Wurtz for 18 minutes?
Why spend an hour watching this when I can listen to Bill Wurtz for 18 minutes?
This is one of my most favorite YT movies :)
But where did the rain come from if we didnt have an atmosphere??
Video is awesome 🙏ThankQ ... but really not worth 1:03:30 hrs. lol I watched it at 2x speed which was more than perfect time for it ..
Why the arabic audience are the least you care about? , how come no arabic caption and it is one of the  most spoken languages .
My science teacher put this on in class once
In case you missed it sex was invented 1.2 million years ago
do the same thing for the history of the universe please 😭😭 (maybe a bit longer)
Love this!!!
I honestly don't get how they do it. Also is the voice who narrates it a real person or like Siri or something.
so uhh lets say we bouta do some heavy grinding
The music gives Mass Effect vibes and i love it.
dang this is amazing!!! great job!
where is the furry dinos TwT
Amazing video!
Cap
love this idea
Beat went hard ngl
Man this is LEGENDARY
I'm a graphic designer and I play this video in the background every day at work. I just love it ! Unbelievable work here. I would love Kurzgesagt to release a artbook. I would buy it instantly ! The music is also incredible ! Thank you Epic Mountain. I would also love to see a video about the making of one of your musics !
THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS MASTERPIECE ❤
how did 750m years ago  have armour when don't have life???
But how did rain come?
Timestamp guy ??
geht hart
"And it all started with a big bang." "BANG!!!!!!!"
This is sooooooooooooo good!
This music is so nice 🤩 love the retro/ 8 bit style with the announcements in between
Half an hour in and it’s already felt like no time yet it’s has been 2.25 billion years
A hot second has never been this long
this honestly feels like a lofi beat ost but instead of a looped animation with random girl theres a history of how everything looked billions years ago. I would say that it feels like different ganre of lofi, more scientific and cooler one
Earth never stopped being a hot fireball, it's just this tiny crust where some funky shit happened. Like baking bread
Earth never stopped being a hot fireball, it's just this tiny crust where some funky shit happened. Like baking bread
34:03
Mesoarchean is my favourite Meshuggah Song
This is still my favorite video! It must’ve taken forever to finish between the animation, the music, and the research. Thanks for all the hard work!
Best explanation ever.. it is very easy to see the video, but hard to collect information about it
Wow this was spiritual, like a creation myth (but not myth)
the fact that animals only appear in the last 10 minutes is mind blowing
I'm neither religious nor spiritual but this video just gave me a deeper understanding of something that I've been clueless about for probably my whole life. It's actually quite wild that the Christian's Bible record of the creation of earth in genesis 1 is quite accurate if you interpret the "days" as "timelines". First it was the creation of the earth(which lacked form and void) and then darkness (the Sun was not as bright as it was today). Then the appearance of water and then land. If you read verses 20 and 21, you would see how it was described that life was indeed "brought forth from the waters". Plants and herbs came into the picture first, and then the creation of every other being, with the creation of Man being last. I just find it uncanny and bewildering for these timelines to be scientifically accurate.
wish there was more explanation like why the earth turned cold during rhyacean and such
Hace 1200 millones de años se inventó el sexo.
Like music and knowledge to my ears thank you team!
That soundtrack is fire
I play this video on loop every night now. It's so soothing to sleep to
lot of "might"....or "could".....
Perfect video to watch while High
I couldn't stop watching this video until the end, the whole hour in a row. I'm still asimilating it.
Thank you for this! 😍
Just tell me how to loose weight pls
The cretaceous, Paleogene, and the Neogene period is just sooooo beautiful, the music and the visuals are just amazing. Kurzgesagt is the only channel that would put this out for free
34:02
그 누구도 하지 못했지만, 이 세상에 반드시 필요했을 영상. 항상 글로써만 보던 것을, 직접 마주할 수 있게 해주셔서 감사합니다. 또 다른 시야가 트인 느낌이군요.
Ah, yes, the millions of years of the future of Earth where giant birbs float through the night sky
What the heck is "much hot and comfy" at 7:22? I love this vid but it irritates me every time I hear it
I enjoyed this video so much, took me 70 million years hit the like button!
Youtube compression absolutely destroys the Eorchean period because of the rain, orbis that just me?
Solo un genuino lol
I woke up right at the Jeff Goldblum joke ☺️
Did they film this in one big shift or did camera people take turns? 😒 Hopefully they at least got a 30 minute lunch
wait, so im watching the earth cooking?
Can someon explain where the water came from in the eoarchean?
why did I start crying at "we are almost home"
So idk if it’s because I just smoked but didn’t you have a video where you said if they wanted to create a sustainable planet/send organisms to create life at the most basic level of life or something like that ? Where the organisms with the funky name could live in extreme temperatures and reproduce? I’m 7:47 in el o el 🥲
Hey I just wanted to watch something to pass the time, why have I instead gained an appreciation for the development and hardiness of life?? Why am I crying??
Where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from and why was there so much water created?
Half is ad 😂😂😂
He forgot the part where golem jumped into Mt doom with the ring
Sex was invented in 1.2 billion years ago lezgoooo
Thank you for this video 🙏 if you’re reading this, have an amazing day/night :)
One second of this video is like about 20,000 average human lifespans end to end.
After Eoarchean, where it rained and rained, and life starts as bacterias (not plants), the sky get clear and it is possible to see the sun, the moon and the stars - Fourth day of creation
So if it rained for millions of years why is the sea salty???? This is not true lies fake news!!!! Rain is not salty
W to the animated camera bird
Al-Quran will show you the Earth History in detail, Trust me. Nice video btw  :)
Timestamps: Hadean - 0:51 Eoarchean - 8:04 Paleoarchean - 13:20 Mesoarchean - 18:35 Neoarchean - 23:51 Siderian - 27:47 Rhyacian - 30:24 Orosirian - 33:42 Statherian - 36:58 Calymmian - 39:38 Ectasian - 42:15 Stenian - 44:52 Tonian - 47:30 Cryogenian - 51:12 Ediacaran - 52:18 Cambrian - 53:35 Ordovician - 54:17 Silurian - 54:49 Devonian - 55:08 Carboniferous - 55:55 Permian - 56:43 Triassic - 57:21 Jurassic - 58:02 Cretaceous - 58:46 Paleogene - 59:48 Neogene - 1:00:21 Quaternary - 1:00:38
27:47 -34:21 never mentioned how the great oxygenation event led to a mass extinction and 34:29 waited until the final time for him to bring it up so I stopped watching because just like most other channels the claim of accuracy never truly applies and given that there is evidence (professor dominik weiss and colleges develop a technique that enables them to analyze the ratios of different isotopes of copper, buried in shale rock deposits which helps them to learn about how the rise of oxygen changed the chemistry of the earths ocean) there is missing information.   Due to this i stopped watching because if that is missing then there is a chance more info will not be present so disliked and not a complete view from me.   I applaud for the animation but i tend to like animations and/or simulations with EVERYTHING INCLUDED so it is a dislike.
Honestly after watching this video and how the world acting now I think all schools and students should just SUBSCRIBE to this channel and the school should make everybody watch this channel for 7 hours a day. It really seem like you learn more from YouTube education section then you will ever learn sitting in a classroom. It's so serious when my daughter come home from school and do her homework we sit down and watch videos like these and really enjoy them. You can never be too old to learn even though I know most of the stuff we watch , she's more into it when I sit ,watch, and explain piece by piece to the point a 5 year old could understand. Then she uses her own intelligence to put two and two together. When I was in school alot of the things they say is true today they was telling us we was wrong or we was crazy. This only prove that a diploma or degree don't mean anything but to just prove to the world=(Government) that you sat in class and remembered every lie they taught you. True knowledge come from self research and common sense once you master that everything pretty much going to be predictable. The only thing I am grateful for is that numbers can't and will never be wrong S/o to MATH💯
Imagine if I got to see this in real life
i feel the urge to rave so bad!
This is nice to fall asleep to
One thing that’s always crazy to me is knowing that when we see these landscapes filled with different plants and animals, that’s only the ones we’ve found. Who knows how many species were lost forever since they weren’t fossilized.
Jesus Christ is amazing! 🌍
thanks for making this video, i know it took a huge effort to create the entire thing
Does this mean that climate change is real
None of this is looped is it? Holy hell man your guys’ dedication is insane
As far as we know, this possibility may or not be true, but is amazing how scientists were able to discover how the earth was created over millions of years ago.
It’s crazy to think that all of human history would fit into less than half a second of this movie.
Dang all i can say is thank you the amount of time and effort an entire hour of animating mustve taken years ❤
So far
Love the soundtrack 👌👌👌
The history of earth fits into an hour here, but every minute at my job feels like 4.5 billion yers.
Neat. But how is anyone really sure that any of this ever even happened?
Impressive work! Thank you for sharing! 🫶🏼
got to 37 mins, pretty cool.
You should make a live wallpaper out of this!
This is great to have on in the background while I catch up on emails, really puts my work in perspective 😂
If you fast forward 5 second that means you skip 7.5 million years.
Play the video  reversely to see how earth will destroy👅
Excellent music
It took me 9 million years to write this comment... keep the good work up!!!
lets not forget the amazing music done for this as well. pure masterpiece
Thanks for your effort 👌
Great to het high to
It probably took longer to render this video, lmao.
How do they know we were in a lava hell phase though
1hr waste  of time its just music
? Youre missing the focal point of creation.. Jesus is not in this video
I love your videos. The music and the visuals are just perfect * 3 * thanks for creating all your content.
apparently now it’s “13.7 billion years”, be ready to update it in another year or so. It should be called the Big Bang religion.
cameraman wildin
wow all that just for me to exist, laying here watching this at 2 am, high as a kite eating nutty buddies. earth really is amazing.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO WATCH ON MUSHROOMS !!!!
incredible music choice
The music in this is god-tier. The way the leitmotif established right at the start is reused and remixed throughout, all the different moods and beats, the way each piece flows seamlessly into the next... I would listen to this as an album by itself ngl, it's a masterpiece  EDIT: holy moly, watching the What Did Dinosaurs Really Look Like video and realising the WHOLE SOUNDTRACK was composed to foreshadow/lead into the reuse of its music starting at 55:45 ...absolutely phenomenal
Nice animation
Anyone else rocking out to the wicked bass and drums during the Mesoarchean?
Wow
what about human history in one hour
That was gorgeous
THANK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOU! ❤️
This was an extremely educational, calm and aesthetic learning journey. Thank you for your countless hours of work to synthesize it all in 1h. Amazing job!
Would’ve loved to see us make an appearance
Maravilloso 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
1:00:08 Whales return to the oceans
Love how the music matches, I found it beautiful how it went from spacey synths all the way to a human choir getting closer to our time. Life is really just of convenience!
the dinosaurs were way smarter than any human!!
science proves all against religion the bible you pray to isn’t the love caring person u think it is we are being controlled n program we are n a soul trap!!! we have lost touch with our spirtual gifts!!
watching this while sitting outside on shrooms is something else fr
I like how dinosaurs and humans just came out of no where. Science will never explain that.
Bill Wurtz Did it in 19:26 minutes
You forgot about 9 billion years
All those people who belive in god and think he made earth in 7 days be like: 👀that ain’t true 😂
I wonder how long it takes to render this animation, this dude probably has GTRTXYZ 108090 PRO MAX GPU to render this
Well done. I just wish the extinction events before chixelub had been indicated by a flash or the disappearance of some figures on the screen. Seeing a homonid in the last second or two was a good effect. Bravo.
Always interesting to see how people THINK they know how the universe was created when they dont even know just speculation. LIKE THE APE THING. Truth is you will never know cause we are APES.
Delete ts
Cap
While watching, I kept reminding myself that 1 second is actually 1.5 million years! So many years that just seem like nothing happened.
cap ☦️
🔥🔥
incredible that this was free to watch. seriously gorgeous, such an impressive piece of work. thank you, kurzgesagt!
The amount of time you spent in animating all this, WOW, and ita beautiful 😍
Your telling me fungi are as old are the Earth's core? That's mind blowing
this gave me an existential crisis
Flat earthers be like: "wHeRe'S tHe CuRvE?!"
The earth is 6000 years old not 4.5 billion years old.
That was amazing
All the video he almost reminded silent
God created all this and there is no big ban you should reed about islam
This is sooooo damn good ✨✨✨✨
This is like a history stimboard for me
None sense 🤣
Wow thank you for spending this much time making a video for us to watch free too!😢😢😢your the best🎉
level of Adobe Ae is crazy
Humans are faking history while we are witnessing it. This made me less trust on everything
The moon looks like a binairy planet instead of a moon at first
this is the best movie i’ve laid my eyes upon
Proposed mapping for Creation (Genesis 1 in the Bible) to the video Before the video: Day 1: Big Bang 0:33 Day 2 - Formation of Earth and sky - perhaps waters refers to dust clouds and lava. 8:20 Day 3 - Oceans forming, then dry land a bit later. Plants finally form about 55:00 55:04 Day 4 - Sky likely clears and you can see the sun, moon, snd stars (my thoughts) 55:50 Day 5: Large sea life and flying animals 1:00:00 Day 6: Creation of land animals (at least more modern ones), and then finally man!
4:11  somehow my body starts grooving
Whoever did the soundtrack for this went crazy
Please make a similar video about the history of humanity. Absolutely loved this video
The late eoarchean looks so peaceful
why is this the coolest things i’ve ever watched on youtube
Any young earth creationist here? xD
The insane amount of time that life on this planet was just cells is wild. The end when multicellular life starts showing up seems so rushed.
Bill wurtz did it better, I'm sorry-
Even at the start. You don't know that. You do know or have the even slightest guess as to how old the planet is. But looks nice fit guess theory..
So you mean it didn't take 6 days?/s  Anyway, let's go terraform Mars, I'm sure it'll take a couple hundred years./s
More people need to see this to realise how all of our history is just a moment in our planet history.  Its amazing that we as a humans progressed soo fast in world domination as a species xD, all it took was to bang some rocks together and boom planet is ours now. :D
But is it worth the antisemitism? Is it worth all of which the people of jewish ideation have suffered at the hands of their fellow man throughout history? Because, thats why
God made earth not this shi u showing Jesus is king
This song is amazing

Amazing video! 😍
You're a legend.... 😊
How do they know earth was hit by another planet named thiea if no humans existed at the time to give it a name
The animation is so breathtaking, thank you so much for this it must have take    years to make
I have no yt premium but only for this video if i minimise it, it's playing in background
Animating 4.5 billion years must have taken trillions of years😯😯😯😯
This is not our 🌎.This world does not belong to humans, we are still very new to the earth.
Well can’t wait to see all the religious Karen’s
I’m 9 years old and I started watching it on 2024 feb 4 I study it but what are the names like Mesoarchean but still I love it ❤
Absolutely crazy
Stop bullshitting. No Person on this Earth RIGHT NOW can prove that the world is over 10, 000 years old. Not 1 or a group of people Living today could prove this. The Earth is much younger. The audacity to keep lying about how old the earth is. Satan
Ultimate ASMR
Whoever made the music for this and whoever the mixing and master engineer was thanks for this master pieces ….. this video is just mesmerizing in all its aspects… in totally madness that we got it for free thanks so much everyone involved in this whole project
amazing holy fucking shit
Shout out to the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens for inventing sex🙏
That means we drinking really old water. 😮😂
I love the  music. Who made it?
But how?
As a ark player this was amazing
45:00 sex is invented
most watched part is so funny lol
make romanian subtitle
wow
God is great
you have to 420 a little to realllly appreciate this
I learned history when its in pictures
Damn why is life so late
Note the fact that this video took 4.5 billion years to make. I guess even after 4 billion or 5 billion years, there will be a video of our lives too, our generation and about the advancements of this generation
Can I find anywhere this song? Like the 1 hour track. It just slaps imo
This is still my favorite video! It must’ve taken forever to finish between the animation, the music, and the research. Thanks for all the hard work!
Amazing!!!
I just wanna say the producer was feeling it in when they were in the studio 😂
This is beautiful.😊
The music got really beautiful by the end.
history of the entire world, i guess
I just started watching this I’m just surprised you didn’t include god in the beginning forming everything 😅
A Masterpiece 10/10
Stenian period: earth sex update.
Getting ready for work whilst watching and ended up ‘crazy dancing’😂
Been watching this channel for so long this made me had to buy some of the merch. Such out of this world content
A little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
Imagine God taking a break from wifees
That was amazing 1:01:54
How did you know all the parts you weren’t there for 🤨
I love how theories are presented as factual data and people believe it. There has been zero data to date that the big bang THEORY is actually true. Scientists make up assumptions to fit modern day narratives.
We’re here cause some bacteria wanted to burp out oxygen. Lol
i love this channel so much! thank u for giving us such content for free!! ❤❤❤
Your works are so great and so important to spread, please never stop <3
WATCH THIS WHEN YOU ARE HIGH
Worst explanation my ncert book gives more knowledge than this wasted my 1 hr
I wrote this comment 14:38  after a billion years
Omg I love it. That wasn’t a microdoses dude. !!!! Amazing video.
It took 6 days to creat earth and heavens 😊
Stenian best era
Water may have existed in the Hadean era, though unlikley its possible
I doubled the play speed, did 4.5 billion years in half an hour😅😅😅
4.5 Billion years? Nah, 6 days ✝
Extraordinary, legendary video!
Bro thinks he's bill wurtz
what a load of bullshit
What a thoughtful video. You can feel the time here. Thank you so much for all the videos this channel has made over the years.
And in the beginning, God said let there be light.
Planet: ALL the vídeo. Human: 1 sec, 💀💀💀
Bullshit 😅

The video that we should have seen at that Earth Science class in middle school! 😂
Carti did this for us
I can't believe im 4.5 billion years  older  my soda is still cold
ur mum is 4.5 billion years old
Confused. You started the video saying 4.5 BILLION. But the time line starts in the “4 millions”. Is that a typo???
40 degrees Celsius / 107 degrees Fahrenheit is pretty hot, but still survivable for the most part.
can someone explain to me where the water come from?
im faded ts tuff
The history of everything i guess
Our history as modern man is just <1 second of the video.
All that needed to happen so we can see,hear,feel,touch. Thank you little thingies loveee youuu so much
so desperate to watch this video quickly I just clicked in on every change.
such an amazing watch, Kurzgesagt will always bring a smile to my face.
All i can say is wow. All of it.
My geography teacher told me that the humans being on earth is the equivalent to the length of a blink in the earths history
im gonna need a cover of the theme of Mesoarchean by Meshuggah asap.
I appreciate your efforts, but why the music, I personally can't follow asleep to this
THE SOUNDTRACK, MASTERPIECE
And then you realize everything is NOW
39:47 Why does that cloud seem sad?
This activity does not happened on other planets?
😮nicee
How sad it is to see how long it took our earth to get this way, and how fast we’re destroying it
Very cool, but it really does make time feel meaningless, doesn't it?
Hinduism explains the same
No wonder earth is so boring.  It took so long to create this video 😮
Imagine they started it with "Hi...*subtle pause*You're on a rock... floating in space..."
Watching this endows me with that special brand of existential dread that, instead of paralysing me, fills me with spirit. We have the privilege to exist on this wonderful, strange planet! Best enjoy it as hard as we can and treasure our safe home in the universe.
4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4
4:09:20
It could hv been within half an hour.... Just dragged it too much
I love this video so much❤.  I'd love to see more things like this
Bettee fucking use this in schools
No one talks about how good the soundtrack of Hadean era is 😅
Unbelievable!!! I loved this video. so much effort was put into it and I enjoyed all of it. Thank you for the awesomeness!
Ummm how did you know?
Love you guys, this video was crazy
The graphics are unsurpassably wonderful. The music--ehh.  I was constantly wishing for Gorecki's Symphony of Sacred Songs.
I love the changing sky at 07:13.
Awesome soundtrack !
A really impressive work of our brains to figure all this out by itself.
How can it randomly rain from space ? How was the sky formed ? Doesn’t rain come from the sea and clouds? This is pretty but it’s all cap .
Nah, typical British weater.
JESUS IS ONLY WAY EARTH AINT THIS OLD. WAKE UP ❤
you guys truly are the best. amazing ❤️
What's even more crazy is that it's just a theory of being 4.5 billion years old.
That is not how the moon was formed lmao
God’s creation is so amazing
It’s crazy how it takes 1 million years for a meteorite to fall
In 45:03 the sex update occurred
This really does prove the Earth is flat!
Jesús Christ is the only way❤
Real shit
Added to “the things I watch instead of studying what I actually need to study”
this got me crying not gonna lie
Now I dont wonder why first industrial revolution happened so late Things take time to develop and happen
I love videos like this. This really makes me want to explore more of the universe. Past, Future, doesn’t matter I want to experience it all.
I've turned on 2x speed to learn 2 times as fast
Really 👌

Polish lyrics please
why are people arguing that this is bullshit when there is no proof of god either?💀
Making this video might had taken much time and THANKS SO MUCH to the maker of this video. It gave me much information
floor is lava hahahahahah
You know what's interesting, our life span feels like forever yet it's not even 10% f how long the earth has been around
19:14  How is there no oxygen? You just said that there is photosynthesis in this period
I like the concept....BUT...."It took forever to make."????  Since 2019???   This video is worthy of the thumbs down I gave it.  I'm not a graphics artist so I'm agnostic on how difficult that part of the video was to make.  The script though was SOOOOoooooooo...skimpy.  Too skimpy.  Embarrassingly inadequate.  It shows evidence of taking a very short time to research and write.    I suggest you approach the script of this video in the same way that a software development project is implemented (e.g. the way Microsoft has developed Microsoft Office over the years).   You've only got an hour to fill but many years in which to do the filling.    Go for it!  Get started today!  I look forward to future iterations of this video.  It has a lot of potential.
OMG! THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN SO LONG AND WE GOT TO LEARN AND WATCH THIS VIDEO JUST FOR FREE CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT'S AMAZING THANKS FOR THIS I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS WORK. GOD BLESS YOU & THANK YOU AGAIN. 😊
This is so insane in so many levels !!
A lot of people from all around the world is gonna scroll through this comment section . So it's better to leave a comment❤.
3.6 billion year ago the keluangman from eoarchean
Thank you creators. I fall in love wit this video, already watched 3 times, dont know how much more İ will watch. There is something so comforting with it, like a white noise ❤🌸
Now I’m ready for my history exam tomorrow
We are about 3 minuts in this world ❤❤❤❤
I really enjoyed the underwater level
Wow.
This truly.... is incredible. Please beam this into space
Best watch when you are high. I love this.
This is the first video of this channel I am watching. The music and animation is incredible. So much each period matches the music it goes with. By the way 1 hour of animation is mostly the same images repeating themselves.
that was absoluetely best video i've ever watch on youtube!
Alot of lies in the vidoe
I still have my tail.
Music ruins it
Beautiful amazing keep it up
This is a work of fine art. Illustrations and animations alike. I hope you won many prizes and money out of this. Thank you
i love this channel sm it rlly brings out my inner stem nerd
thank you so much for this masterpiece. we really are just a millisecond of history, let that sink in!!
All lies and made up stuff.
This lightning gave me an add😂
Let me start earning, I'll have an entire room with walls dedicated just to your posters.
This is the part where the song hits hard 3:45
Y'all better not believe this
53 minutes in and no animal yet. Damn 😂
This is what the internet was made for!!
producers are cooking with this one !
Very good video amazing 😁
Camera man 🤓🤳
Nice theory and effort in making this
i have been watching and listening to this video over and over again... it's so good as a background music while working.
1:40. can someone explain to me what is left 4.5billion years ago and how they did they discover it?
absurd
Alright guys, which era had the sickest beats
Too much science cant understand the video
Did the moon make lava waves ? 🌊
Dude the video is so detailed that my my flagship phone literally keeps crashing.
Scientists don't know as much as they think 😕
Nonsense flop editing Irretating
"In the beginning..."
And y’all believe this? 😂
I’m a billion years in!! I was never really interested in things like this when I was younger but for some reason I’ve become obsessed as an adult! Thanks for making interesting content that’s easy to absorb for noobs like me 😅🫶🏼
you coming after bill wurtz? 🤨🤨
this was amazing❤
Beautiful, beautiful video!!!
Watching it all to the end was soooo worth it! We are soo special and yet so young🤯
29:42 i love that part when it glitches :)
Just clicked for outer wilds
What a wonderful scale of geological time. Kurzgesagt - don't ever change!
Dam can you imagine if humans were born through eggs instead? Sheesh
Im
Like anyone today can actually say for certain how old the Earth is. C'mon now.
The end of life on Earth will be with the demise of the sun. It is very surprising who will live this era😊
Now do it one hour on humans' history
It's insane to think that people really think the earth is flat.
This channel has less subscribers than it deserves 🤧🤧
Ayooo45:00
Watch 4.5 Billion years in 30 mins, run this video @ 2x
Thanks teori
The fact that dinosaurs only existed for a few minutes in this scale is wild
Wait that doesn’t make sense .. How is going to rain for more then 100 million years if the earth was lava and H20 didn’t even exist
The thing is, who found out the history?
No joke I'm absoloutely speechless... I mean, this video is something only I could dream was true, and yet here it is. You're kidding!?! And all for free, to?!!
Salute to your hard work sir😮.
PLANET EARTH IS "THE MOST AMAZING THING" OF ALL. Thanks to the whole team of this channel where nothing stops from seeking knowledge for the lovers of knowledge.
And to think the majority of this Is a completely fabricated origin story... when in actuality God had created the heavens and the earth
Bruh its 4am. I wish i didnt have to work in 3 hrs. I will just save this video for later and watch after my shift
This must be the most skipped video in Youtube history.
this is awesome
incredible
I was just vibing wit teh music 🕺🏻
Imagine living in a world where this all feels like the like an optimistic beginning of something that goes for a billion years and beyond.   Instead, it feels more like the end.  Some people suck.
The universe is 13 billion years old though not 4 billion years old
Beautiful .. I remember when u had 5.8 million subscribers 2 years ago
dont lie, you came to the comment section because you were waiting for a phase to finish haha
HEY ON THAT BEAT THOUGH 🙏💥😍  It felt like I was stuck in a FUGAZI DREAM
Lol bro the gig is up no one believes this anymore
😂😂
I have hppd and your video helps me sleep i love it :(
what religion is this?
This is Total Madness. Read your Bibles💯🙏
GOD MADE THIS WORLD IT DID NOT FORM BY ITSELF💯🙏
How did it rain without water already being in the earth
Suddenly it started to raign ???? Boiling lava no atmosphere  but raigning i´m surprised how nobody have a better explination.
I blinked and I missed 4.5 million years
Aliens watching this: 👁👄👁
How did it just start raining? What caused the rain in the beginning?
In a Nutshell - thanks
Cool!
This video is going to be amazing but I can't watch it now. Watch later list don't work for me so could anyone please reply to this comment after some time so I can get reminded of this video? Thank you.
Ever tried in 2x. Full trance broda🪬
ich brauche die deutsche Version davon BITTEEEEE
Hungaryan subtitles pls 😮😊😊
Where's the God?
This video is amazing 😍😍😍
Damn homie. This beat goes hard
It was a delight watching this without skipping, even if there was no one commenting at times.
This is just amazing. I can't imagine how many work hours you guys have to put into that. Well done. I hope no one skip any second like me. Really, really worth it! ❤️
Good with a dance music 😊
how did we get water with no oxygen in the atmosphere 19:24 ?
i seen 4,5 billion years
glad to see this masterpiece in youtube, i dont have to see similar video like this, thankyou for you kurzgesagt to serve this to humankind. I hope you and yout team stay upgrade this channel, love youu
At the end someone comes and says there is no god 🤓 everything is just a coincidence  God said in the Quran :  Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?
How does one even animate this
im not watching this rn i’ll save it for when i’m high
You guys are sooooooooooooooooooo awesooooooooooooooome!!!
Another thing your brain can't grasp is that this is pure speculation. There is not one shred of evidence that proves any of this happened. I know because I've looked for the past 10 years for evidence and there is zero. We humans like to pretend that we know everything which actually means we know nothing.
Why doesn't it have Spanish subtitles? :(
I’m sorry but nothing will ever beat “the entire history of the world, I guess” as long as this site exists
It's still blows my mind how this is free
This is genuinely a masterpiece…
The music is so amazing
How do we know this? We don’t.
Dropping a comment purely because I want that funny milkman guy to debate me. :P  For real though, and in all seriousness, this video is a wonderful gift to the platform. The art style is fantastic as always, and combined with the awesome musical backing from Epic Mountain, it's a truly hypnotic experience.
Does the paleoarchean have coral already?
I really do appreciate the hard work that went into this piece of crap
Oh my God this is such a bunch of bullshit
Didn't like it that much, 90% of the video is eletro music and funny animes rolling...
Finished watching this on my 4th attempt because it always put me to sleep in the first billion itself 😂
Bill wurtz did it in 20 minutes
Best troll video ever. Earth is only 6000 years old.
crazy to think that we have existed for approximately 0 seconds.
Great work! Your videos are awesome!
Lies. Cool animation tho! I hold a biblical view of creation. Not evolution. Science has disproved evolution of single cell organisms.
i liked this video so much it took me a billion years to think of a comment!
I'm just here for the soundtrack 20:00 goes hard af and definitely djents lmao
I was looking forward to earth's birth.  Everybody's still guessing on that one I guess.
My biggest question of all is how did rain form without water in Eoarchean?
this is what i’ve been looking for.
This video shows just how long Precambrian time is, on most geologic time maps it shows a small portion of the map as Precambrian time, and Cambrian and beyond as the rest. In this 1 hour video, Precambrian time was 52 minutes of it. Most of earths history is Precambrian. Everything is listed as Precambrian because cool things happened after the Cambrian explosion
How do we know this is how it happened for sure 🤔
we human more faster in this 100 years than before
Yall are stupid if you don't show prove of the earth colitis with another planet...
wow that's truly amazing as a fan of the history of the universe, it was great to see the billions of years of earth's history basically in the time it takes to watch a movie but is kind of sad the human story in the video passed so fast. Make's me wish there was a squeal on human story even if it's five or more years away. Videos' like this just give people idea's of how long creation took, and why it needs to be protected, this channel needs to keep do what their doing what their doing. you guy are amazing !!! 😁
0:43 yes I believe in god but that doesn’t mean this didn’t happen too
Oh great, my clueless @$$ really needs this . [ Sun 7:16pm 1/28/2024 ]
this video is very educational 🎉
11:20
6:33
A lot of speculation but still fantastic
Where’s the water comes from ?
Absolute anti-science BS is this video.
Thank you
This YouTuber just made World History teachers shit themselves
Amount I’ve learnt from these guys! So lucky to have you this video is amazing 🔥🔥
Fy bro suck billion years
This has honestly become one of my fav videos to slowly fall asleep to  Perfect story telling time
The quality of these videos and the amount of research and work that goes into them is unmatched. Thank you for creating things like this and making them available to everyone regardless of income.
And yet Christian’s and Catholics will claim the earth is only 6,000 years old
Don’t let a Catholic or a Christian watch this video. They’ll claim that a book written by a bunch of grown men 20 years down the line that the earth is only 6,000 years old.
Yes we are new, so new. Praise God the everlasting the supreme the creator of everything.
The earth is 6000 years old.
None of that ever happened. Neat cartoon, but you shouldn't try to pass it off as the truth.
AWESOMEEEEEE
Wow need i say more?

Give the cameraman sum respect for standing there for 4.5 billion yearssssss slay video too
Simply FABOLOUS!!!
this doesn't make any sence
This must be the extended cut from "history of the entire world, i guesss" 😂  loved it👍
<<<666=B-66, E-69, R-82, G--71, O-79, G-71, L-76, I-73-0-79=666>>> Pope Francis is, "BERGOGLIO," the beast out of the sea revelation 13...!
Earth is not billions of year old...!
That watch time is insane 🤯👀
God created the heavens and the earth
the thumbnail is a rivals fo aether refence
And their theories just so stupid 🤣
Hyvinhän mä tähän tea mahdun
Mää oon nyt 29 ja aika vitun monta ikuisuutta nii jos katotaa 70-80 en kyl usko et silloinkaan pääsisin kuolee ennen 60 no kiinni veti se on muuten siinä ennen 60 kuoltava
Being a meteorologist would be a cake job back then.   "The forecast predicts rain for the next few hundred million years, folks."
❤
God: I wonder what this button does   One hour later: Holy crap
This is so cool
Do one with space
this is basically the coolest roku screensaver ever
I Miss the day when the world is full of lava, and now IM living 5 billion years
I love your content so much, its great you're able to mach stuff like this!  I was not expexting to vibe along with geologic history tonight.
That watch time is insane 😂
So for hundreds of millions of years it was a ball of lava in space and one day it starts raining and doesn't stop until the earth is 70% water....things that make you go hmmm.
The Doctor is watching this to analyze it for accuracy.
Can someone tell me, how in the Eoarchean period, that Water came from the sky and rained for so long. How did it occur?
Source: trust me bro.
Now I know how God feels, Watching time pass by while drinking beer
moon got cooldown in 6:10
The Big Bang is not real god made the earth
bro you should make a game where its a space sandbox and you can destroy planets and whatever stuff it would be so cool
It is literally unwatchable without subway surfers and slime in the background 😂. But to be real wit yall, this vid is a masterpiece.
Good job Kurzgesagt, keep it up.
Lol
We should've appeared earlier, we'd have much more technology if we did
Note I don’t recommend watching this if you don’t have YouTube premium or ad blocker…4.5 billion years back certainly we never had advertisements 😅
Shower thought after seeing this: Imagine how difficult modern life today would've been if dinosaurs didn't went extinct..
God created heaven and Earth in 6 days, end of story
This is a nice fairy tale
I CAME ON YOUTUBE TO WATCH THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BY BILL WURTZ AND THEN THIS WAS ON MY FEED
I wanted to sleep lol but how could i not watch this whole thing.
Cameraman is soooooooooooooooooooooooo patient
2 facts that i know:did you know you can time travel?!?!?! you can time travel by sleeping i learned that whenever i say in my mind (everyone cant time travel) but also we see everything in 2D and also electronics screens are 2D but you might say "we have depth perspectives on our eyes though" and ur right but you will still see 2D
Ignore 58:37
Thank you for the journey. Ive always wanted to see the history of the earth played and this was perfect.
Wow 😍 thanks for the amazing work ❤
this MIGHT be THE video of the 2023
People the Earth is thousands of years old.   This is not real science.
Bitte auch auf dem deutschsprachigen Kanal. Einfach nur spitze 😊
anyone else watch the whole vid for no reason just like   it was cool and you love this chanel
I actually feel bad to watch it for free it is incredible video
So many science deniers in the comments
❤😻😍🥰✨🔥🌋⛈️🌧️⛅🌤️☀️🌎🦠🪸🪱🦑🦐🐡🐝🐌🐸🐊🦈🪴🌲🐢🦖🌺🦕🦔🦆🦤🦃🐧🐀🦥🐎🐅🐒🦍🦧💃🏽🕺🏽
This is sooo much better on 1.25x speed. Music is catchy.
Would have loved it if all the eons showcased day/night cycles too
Dont tell people who believe in a god  person this. They will say it only take 7 days
This is amazing to have in the background as i play minecraft <3
This may be the best video on youtube
Ενσωματώστε ελληνικούς υπότιτλους αν ειναι δυνατόν. Ευχαριστώ
best video ever!, littarly learned more here then in school
One of the best videos I've ever seen on YouTube ❤ Amazing journey, and a beautifully enlightened perspective came from this. Thank You 👍🏼🙏🏼
Brilliant. Love the music too. Wait wait but but but the christians tell us Earth is only 6,000 years old 😂 AND was made in a week! 🤣 Cough.
Kurzgesagt is awesome as always ❤
Beautiful
Cool
I’m so happy u made a English acc so u can reach more people 😩👏🏾
i love the prog rock that’s playing over this 👌
Don’t know which one I like more. The music? Or the animation? I find myself grooving to the music while forgetting to watch the animation.😊 That’s OK. I’ll just watch it again. 😊
Earth is flat
wow! thank you.
This is a great theory of how God created earth
This type of video always reminds me about how much I love our planet, nature, and life. Thanks Kurzgesagt 💙💚
awesome video. C4D + AE is the biz.
Thank you sooo much, really appreciate it
Had to go to the bathroom. Was in there for 20 million years. People were complaining.
1 hour of amazing animation and knowledge feels like illegal to watch for free!   Thank you @kurzgesagt❤❤❤
Show this to Joe Rogan
i keep getting confused cuz they say "4.5 billion years ago" and "2.5 billion years ago" but the text in rhe top right corner says million,,, i think maybe it was a typo but i was so confused for a solid 10 minutes
What camera is this?
“Don’t blink or you might miss all of human history.” It’s hard to imagine millions of years going by when so much has happened in the little that we have been here.
100’s of millions of years of asteroids being hurdled in this direction in space is weird to think about. What does that, and to THAT MANY objects in space?!
this is like watching paint dry
this is insane
Thank you for this high quality video :D
wow amazing !! just like always kurzgesagt🔥 🔥 🔥
🇳🇵 🇳🇵 🇳🇵
Can't believe i made it through the entire video. I imagined myself being there as an immortal being going through waiting right from the beginnin,  baron parts of complete loneliness waiting for change as billions of years go by alone and when the part happened where the first living organism came by I felt like an eternity and OH MY GOD IT'S MOVING. And then i started seeing all this life around me surrounded by things that moved without me touching it. This video literally made me ride the video and really wanted to feel as if I was in there the whole time. Absolutely Brilliant video, spectacular 👏
Mach so ein Video auf deutsch
Prove any of this
Wait is everyone watching this vid 4.5b years old bcuz technically u just expeurenced 4.5b
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🦾🦾🦾🫁🫁💪💪💪✨️🧚‍♀️🙏🙏🙏🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
Watched it at 2X
Would intelligent life be limited to land if you think about it? Imagine if we were water based, our spaceships would have to be full of water/how would you create stuff if you constantly have to be submerged in water, it would seem an intelligent water/liquid based species would be limited to their planet and handicapped by that liquid in a sense, hope this made sense 😃.
QUICK QUESTION why did it jump from Cretaceous period to Paleogene period with no blackout?
Tldr: human history on earth today is just a blip, not even a side kick
❤
The background music. Cant finish🤯😔
When all earth is lava, where the rains came from?
Incredible videos, yet the name for your channel needs to be change I reckon, it's not easy to remember or spell
Im betting u forgot god
spent 11 minutes and 20 seconds of my life vibing to this
''we think'' ''we theorize'' ''it probably''. In other words, you don't know.
Its so Impossible that it would exists from the beggining without someone creating it. There must be something at the very start of everything. The creator the author. -God
is it called hadean becase of the greek god hades?
1:00:45. God made humans 6 billion years ago not that early. It’s like saying Humans was made yesterday, not true.
The earth could be 70 billion years, or 700 billion year or 7 trillion years, since it took God 7 days to create earth.
The earth is older than 4.5 billion years. It’s 7 billion years since it took God 7 days and I guess that means 7 billion years and scientists haven’t found the oldest rocks yet.
It is a privilege to have access to such great content for free. Being alive is more worthwhile thanks to videos such as this. Thank you Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell, your efforts make the world a better place❤
7 billion years = 7 days.
I think 6 billion years + 1 extra billion years. So earth is 7 billion years since it took God 6 days and he rested the 7th day.
So it took 4 Billion years for God to create earth but for him only 6 days.
4 Billion years ago? Earth existed that long? God must have sent Adam and Eve to earth when Earth had existed for super long.
4 Billion Years ago, Justine Bieber released his first Album.
4 Billion Years ago the first airplane was made
4 billion years ago, ice Cream was invented
People lived 4 billion years ago and succeeded to document it on paper.
i do not believe you are you telling me you don't know and some how and i am not sure  i believe in god better than this jokes
59:38 absolute best part of the whole video
The beginning of the Earth and the beginning of life on it is really interesting. The fact that we live on the same planet that all of these events happened to before is crazy.
If I wanted to know the history of the world, I could just watch bill wurtz
Came for the History, stayed for the sick beats
This reminds me of the Grand Canyon scene on the Disneyland railroad, but even better! I love it!
Good job to the animators for this solid performance
Ah yes the church of Science theory repeatedly proven false and fraudulent
God make everything keeb your dreams
I'm waiting to hear pink floyd to start playing
There is no other Creator then God  ☝🏻... Col 1:16:  For everything was created through him— in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, empires, rulers, leaders and authorities— everything was created through him and for him. Jesus Christ is Lord and you all need to change your minds to not perish in the eternal fire 🔥.
Just by double clicking on screen i travel a millions of years. it's amazing, isn't it?
Incredible!
Grasping an understaning of our part in this history is awesome.  I have been pondering this for the last 6 months.  If very 100 years was 1 second then human only makeup about 1 hour of a 1 year and 4 month story.  Our lives assuming we only live for 100 years is 1 second at the end.  A literal blink in the epoch we call time.
We can fit the entire history of the world in an hour but not the lord of Fnaf 😭
Kurzgezagt ultimate boss
Honestly, who else fast-forwarded a couple of centuries?
history of the entire world i guess
The paleoaerchon time period is underwater right?
What a s***t video
1.5 b years and yet our year is 2024  I don't get it 😅
The music track is a banger. Do you have it on spotify?
Thanks
Can u do the entire solar system?
This is insane im definitely not having a crisis
Thank you, perspective is important.
The video is almost over, up to date, current year... All forms of life are still microscopic, and the video is almost over... wtf...
Ooh the music is linked in the description
How lava gonna turn into oil 😮it would harden solid
what it is is beautiful. thank you!
1:30 .....the floor is lava...... I remember that from when I was a kid.........
29:43-44 glitch
Grat video!!!! and also the background music is 🔥
This is so flipping cool!!
Are we talking about the same format of time or length of calendar years just as today when we say 4.5 Billion years ago? If it is, then it is amazing how long it was like millions of years ago when everything around is just only LAVA!😉😊
I can’t believe that after all these years kurskesagt really didn’t disclose the extra 3 minutes. Truly unwatchable
1). I fell asleep watching this. I can't believe I slept for millions of years! 2). This makes me want to play Spore, oddly enough.
Hello! You probably wont see this and wont do it even if you do but i think itd be really cool if you started a series showing the history of different ethnicities!
This all  a theory that can not be proven what so ever
I wanted to see something exactly like this since I first thought about it like 10 years ago, it's so fascinating to see just how long everything was just a whole lot of nothing, amazing 100/10
Remarkable work. I wish you best things❤❤❤❤❤
44:58 SEX!!! was invented.
👌👌👌
So it's not global warming, it's just oceans taking over again? Fair enough! Guys use as much fuel as you all can.
You have to be insane to believe this is true. All of recorded human history is equivalent to .006 seconds of this video. 4.5 billion years is incomprehensible. Humans went from rock carvings and cave painting to the printing press in less than 6,000 years. Yet you would like me to believe that anyone on this earth could predict the age of the earth with any sort of accuracy when we can’t even definitively figure out how the pyramids were built. Evolution is a religion. Anyone believing that a primordial soup turned into human civilization as we know it is absolutely brainwashed. These are the same people that would have tried to convince you that the sun revolves around the earth because there was a scientific consensus. Scientists are not gods. They play pretend and throw wild numbers out to “prove” their theories. Interesting how the age of the earth keeps getting older and older exponentially as if more time will help the evolutionary theory. 1 minute into this video and there is already a world shattering discrepancy for anyone that believes this. The moon starting as a bigger object closer to earth defies physics. The gravitational forces would pull the moon back into the earth  because of the inverse square law. Crazy that these people believe this as fact.
this is what happens inside your lunchbox during the summer holidays
I want to emphasise how through all these time the sky had no pollution, so the stars must’ve been very visible
This is amazingly done! Super music, super animation, super theme, super research, super projection, super voice, einfach sehr Gut...   It's clear why Kurtzgesagt has 21.7+ subscribers and it grows!  And for free..   Thanks for that!!! 😉
Life started with creation of bacteria, makes you think how us humans are nothing more than parasites
This makes you think how ignorant we are to the universe
This right here is art
The music in this entire video goes so hard. I don't even know how you come up with a soundtrack that encapsulates 4.5 billion years but somehow you did.
This rail line is abysmally slow
I think you didn't give any part about the GRB hit the earth during late ordovician extinction.
We need a 4.5 billion year version of this. Just to show the most dumb people in existence that the timeline of Earth wasn't in just one hour :)
Absolute cinema.
off-topic: if you want to learn extra detail on how the earth formed and the history of mankind as a game, try playing cell to singularity!
@kurzgesagt Would you guys do a version without the commenting? This like the tenth time a see this video and of course love the notes but also music is so enjoyable when I reed that I like an instrumental version… please guys!!  Upvote comment so Kurzgesagt can read it if you’re agree
It has not been 4.5 billion years, where did thst nonsense even came from
Sometimes i wish i will turn into a ghost when im dead. Watching where the earth going to. Seeing the beginning of time. Seeing how the world ends. Not only how the humanity ends, but the real world end.
I knew religion was a hoax! Seven days? I took only an hour! Thanks for the documentary!
Someone explain how we got this knowledge
The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Great work!
Yeah but how do pundits deal with infinity  Like what was happening BEFORE the billionaire birth began smart asses?
You got to be a fool to believe this nonsense.
Rather than proceed at a constant rate, it would have been better to spend less time at the beginning and much more time on the details that come later.  Human and mammalian evolution would have made great topics to explore.
Pre  - comment ... .this has 7.8M Views... if this dosnt suck ill edit this comment.  BROOOO 1 Min in and you got your facts wrong... fuck me... ok waiting to edit..
Mesoarchean banger
Amazing job!
Props to the animators and the music artists Fr they made 1 whole hour of content and this has to be like a few million frames this must've taken years to create and to think we're getting this for free thank you for all the animations I even watch you when I'm out of school cuz y'all's videos are so good
The moons gravitational pull slowed our planet from 6 hour days to 24 hour days & the steam in the atmosphere gave us the oceans we have now & cooled the planet down for life to exist. No moon collision=no life on earth.
GOD IS GREAT FOREVER 🌿🌿🌷🌷🎵🎵🎶🎶💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
False information.
The best video on YouTube by far, so far.
Music sounds like I’m in a GTA heist
I leave this playing every night as I fall asleep...I know you guys do too
Great idea to put the formation of the earth into a one-hour video. Thanks.
Why were there fire asteroids hitting the earth!? What were they from another galaxy or what
I don't get it.
Stupid video don't recommend
how was moisture created while the planet was molten and being bombarded by asteroids?  i don't understand how water was created in this environment.
if earth is a hell of lava where did water came from?
I would have done it in 30 minutes flat bro. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I blinked and I missed the Homo sapiens. But I don't think I actually miss much--nothing important was missed in that blink of an eye.
In the Cryogenian era, shouldn't life survive under the ice? usually ice doesn't cover 100 per cent, underneath it there may be currents of water. Probably it was challenging for the sex-inventing algae and for those tiny armoured thingies, but some of them will surely survive. There is always a couple who do, not matter what.
The new ASMR video to fall asleep I did not know I need.
🤣😂🗯
I would love to have this as a wallpaper 🫶
Brilliant brilliant brilliant 👏
False!!!! God created heaven ang earth
This is Epic.  Keep it up and thanks.
2am, high af, eating honey bunches straight out the box with earphones on max volume ❤️‍🔥 The soundtack on this vid is AMAZING, dont kno who made it but Man is it 🔥🔥
Yes! found my sleeping video.
The instrumentals in this is so good. This channel is like PBS for stoners 😅 I just wanted to say thank you for this. It is both a visual masterpiece and gives a cool beat to “life” to. It’s incredible and I play it during studying for veterinary school. And sometimes I just play it because it’s pretty to look at 😅
The mesoarchean slapped I like to think that was the music playing in the background   So does the orosirian period
Beautiful video❤
Wow thanks for this. My 5.5 year old son loved this!
The techno is a nice touch.
Surely the longest camera movement ever! Congrats! This was supreme!
phillip. du hast echt etws großartiges erschaffen! Viele Leute wurden durch eure videos inspiriert da bin ich mir sicher!
This is something I definitely recommend watching while high
The depth of procrastination I go to .
It's incredible that you managed to get the footage to make the documentary..
Extraordinary video - if followed without jumping forward -, important for many, or too many, reasons. (Temporal and spatial measurements that are too deep and dilated, as mentioned at the beginning, cannot be cognitively "processed", and this leads to a misunderstanding of many, too many things regarding the formation of the natural world and of life...).
How can I believe this ??
Wow worked on this video for 5 years. That’s dedication
Boring ahhhh video
How do I leave 10.000 likes?  I DO need to know that... Someone invent it, please!!
Bravo!❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
23:02 all I know about the mesoarchian era is that the music ROCKED
Then there comes a creature who has the ability yo name some things and then he names everything and basically destroys everything...☹️
What software did you use for the animations?
54:01 The way I gasped and lost my excited smile 😧  😭😭 IT TOOK THAT LONG NOOOOOO BRING THEM BACK NO
45:45 I FOUND IT WILD HOW 45 minutes and 45 seconds in and I still haven't seen the dinosaurs THIS IS SO FUN HAHAHAHAHHA
This is my new background music when grinding for exams, activities, projects, or literally anything I'd do that requires deep focus.   I did not expect my attention span while watching this to last this long, the fact that I was entertained for so long just watching changes in scenery and music, proves there's something other than car sickness that'll stop me from scrolling through my phone... Hot-like-how-earth-was-at-newborn-age-hot damn! BEST VIDEO EVER
BS sometimes they can't even figure out how long the body's been dead they have to study insects to determine approximate time of death and you people think someone knows this
That's not what i read in Bible....
Came for the history, stayed for the soundtrack
From what sources is this information from?
I like that the mesoarchean is djent
I ain’t even study bruh, just watched the whole thing
Evolution is a neat fantasy
*God is good.*
Love this
so many idiots denying science in the comments
In Gamany??
6,000 years is how long the universe has been a thing
This Channel is amazing! The fact some guys living in Munic, Germany founded it inspires and amazes me as a local living not too far! You can tell they really love what they do!!
Pure Diamond! Thank you and big up!
Big bullshit 😂
Given the high rewatchability of this video, good music is actually quite important. And you nailed it, guys! It's really good background music as well. :)
The sun is a deadly lazer
Christians be like: nu uh, thats not what my magic book about a sky daddy says 😡
YOOOO GUYS WHY DOES THIS VIDEO STILL PLAY WHEN I PRESS THE HOME BUTTON IN A MINIPLAYER?!?!?!?!?
And 1,000 years ago humans began to migrate to other planets how extraordinary isn't it 😂
We are literally in hell its just cooled a lot now..😂😂
How to make a solar system for living things on earth.
hats off to the DJ for living for 4.5 billion years to make this fire🔥🔥🔥
I studied to this video. so cool🔥🔥
omg german version please
Earth is 14 billion years young.
Not that everyone is religious but for me personally this puts a whole new perspective on living for eternity
In the beginning GOD created the heavens and the 🌎.....😅
No not using this idiot clip
This video doubles as a optical illusion, my vision still wants to follow the frame lol
Can someone please explain how we know what happened 4.5 BILLION years ago? I’m curious…
I don't believe this crap. 😂
How was there rain so long ago ???? (Just curious)
Oh no I'm 2 months late! What did I miss?!
So are these time frames called eras, periods, ages or what?
Omg! I'm 37 yrs old, and from the documentaries I've on this subject, this one is really the cherry on top! Best thing I've seen or listen too
What about god thought he made the world ?? Feel like I been lied to 😂😂😂😂😂
very good voice and very good music 🎵🎶
How could anybody know that totally impossible
Evolution is a lie!
This is amazing. Thank you so much for all your work
How long did it take to make this? must have been 217 trillion years
I've been living in this video ever since I found out about its existence.
i learned how the age cryogenian existed
Pure art, beautiful. Subscribed immediately.
I thought that the earth was 13.7 billion years old, not 4.5.
Hey, that Kaliman (Calymmiam) dub mix is dope!
Im high asf watching this...epic video thank you
amazing idea, if only it wasnt so vague and empty would have loved to hear more about the processes at which bacterias developped and took over stuff, how the atmosphere changed or what is the "new stuff" life could use after tectonics dynamics took place such a missed opportunity on a master class video
imagine trippin on that
Thanks sir for providing this great type of knowledge to us science lovers ❤
That was insane and awesome, thanks! Some highlights: Siderian: look mah, I invented climate change! Oh wait oh crap! Calymmian: Johnny, did you just bang that bacteria? You know they and us archeae are not the same species right? You didn't? Oh phew, you could have given birth to a line of monstrosities that will destroy most life on the planet over a billion years from now.  Stesian: algae invents sex. i.e. all couple problems begin here. Want to solve all couple problems? Travel back to this period in time and hunt down those naughty boys. Tonian: eukaryotes invent gangs and start bullying bacteria. Bacteria still try to get revenge on us from time to time. Viva la bacteria revolution! We shall take back what was ours! Cryogenian: first time trying this cryogenics thing. Maybe it actually worked? Carboniferous: get your global warming fuel here! Cretaceous: oh no, you didn't tell me that was the reset button! Quick, let's modify the species so they can survive. The dinosaurs can evolve into fried chickens. I mean birds. Hmm fried chickens.
Strange that I never knew before this just how old electronica is
Good animation but the information is a guesswork
So, what was the catalyst for life to split into plants, algae, fungi and animals?
Man this guy has been around a long time.
An amazing take. Fascinating science that brings us so deep back into the past.
Awesome! But I' ve missed some volcanoes and lava for some billion years.
This was amazing 🎉 congrats
I fell asleep exactly 13 mins in hahaha I came back today to watch again because I was actually really interested the soundtrack is just such a sound masterpiece 🤌🏽
I wonder what other life forms and creatures will be born after this one, this time lapse in one hour just makes me Believe more that all this is an experiment of someone (God, alien's or both)😅 who knows. Awesome video by the way, you just saved me from time traveling and not making it back. Lol
40:12 very fire music
парадокс, але це єдине відео на youtube, яке я не пришвидшувала і не перемотувала
Why didn’t they animate the asteroid? Lazy
This is bullshit. Jesus and God created the Earth 10,000 years old. Boom. Saved everyone 2 hrs of their time smh
Should have been 20 mins long, lots of side scrolling past the same animation.
1:00:39 to see evolved monkey
🏆
19:41 if you want kurzkatket’s rendition of the doom theme
There is so little evidence for the lunar impact theory, and so much against it. There is absolutely no explanation for how the moon got there that explains all its impossible properties. There is no other moon in the whole observable universe that is like ours. It’s an absolute mystery.
Send this to Neil Degrasse, he does a lot of “putting things into perspective” and this is a great example of doing just that! Keep up the amazing work! BaTW sorry I don’t know a batter word then amazing, just calling it amazing really undercuts the quality of your work.
Everyone is so amazed by this video, it's a good video, but at a very basic level, for each 10 minutes, there are a few sentences of basic information, so what is with all this awestruck? Guess teenagers and less intelligent adults were impressed
Gen Z is not ready for this video...
HOW THE HELL DO WE KNOW ALL OF THIS?
Didn't bill wurtz already do this but in less time
I’m supposed to study but here I am; watching earths history😂
33:55 the Verdeforte impact right? Or were you talking about the Yarrabubba impact?
If you don't worship Allah Most High, you won't learn. This world was created by the Most Merciful, all-Knowing, Lord of All-Worlds, and Islam (submission to Divine Will) is the religion closest to reality, but most people don't know... If you love God, say there's no other God but Him, the One, without any partners, transcendent beyond whatever you imagine of Him, known by holy revelation (the Quran) and the inspired way (Sunnah) of His final messenger, Muhammad, most beloved to Allah and best of Creation. Oh people, I invite you to believe in your Creator and say, "There is no God but The God!", May Allah forgive our deficiencies and admit us among his righteous servants into His mercy. Lord send your prayers and salutations and peace on our prophet Muhammad, the wisest sage to walk this earth, the inheritor of Abraham's monotheistic religion, upon him be peace.
The Mesoarchean had some really good music too!
I feel like a god
Great  Effort should be appreciated 👌🏻 👏
Whoever watch this all the way to the end is a real nerd
How was it made though that's why I m here lol 0:40
get this vid to 4.5 billion views
in what programm do you animate?
58:18 life finds a way 😄😆
dope soundtrack! :)
Epic Mountain: Submarine Time Machine my fav of all the good music here
so they had H2O but no oxygen that's wild
The way life shows up so soon and then sticks it out through all imaginable crap makes me feel that it's an inevitable emergent phenomenon, why wouldn't life emerge automatically on other earth like planets? The physical and chemical processes are all identical. It seems too strange for there not to be life elsewhere in the galaxy and nearly impossible in the whole universe. I mean how unique would earth have to be?
3billion years and only single cell organisms 😮
Thank you K! I love your content ❤
Awesome sound track!! Love it
I love this channel ❤
well, time to light up the joint, and dive into this trip !
Despite all this someone above human comprehentian some being started all this, beyond space and time and He is God!
This video changed me
Wrong
Could you make an abridged version as well that just includes the talking points and which time period they take place in?
Such a lovely video, I can't believe how new we are on this planet 😮❤
Gonna use that for studying for sure!
THE FLOOR IS LAVA!
Its amazing to think that in all of history, we dont even make up 0.001% of it.
I just sat down and watched. And I have no regrets.
I sat through this on my bus ride to work and all I could think was how grateful I am to know the people I do, especially boyfriend. Through all of this, I’ve been blessed to love this person because our timelines intersected at this point in creation.
A masterpiece. Thank you.
4.5 billion year ago the masked singer malaysian from hadean
high af watchin this 😅
Thank you! 🎉 This is excellent. Side note: update the existential crisis playlist please. 😁
Pseudoscience 🫢🫣
I didn't realize it was actually going to take 4.5 billion years to watch
Şu posterler çok iyi ama kargo 50€ TR'ye 🥶🥶
I fell asleep in Neoarchonian and woke up in Statherian
It’s midnight here, in bed, and instead of falling asleep to this, I’m bobbing my head. LoL
In german pls Alle Inhalte die ihr nicht auf eurer deutschen seite habt müssen so schnell wie möglich nachgeholt werden. Jeden monat ein video ist nicht genug. Könnte jeden tag eure videos anschauen. Besser als jede doku vom rundfunk👍👍👍
Sir Issac Newton - "It is the perfection of God's works that they are all done with the greatest simplicity. He is the God of order and not of confusion."  Albert Einstein - "I am not an Atheist."  Martin Luther King Jr (Letter from Birmingham Jail) -  "We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation."
Next time you guys need a Synth soundtrack done, let me know. This soundtrack is so poor, it's distracting from the quality of your voiceover of your otherwise compelling and well-executed storyline.
Thank you for educating me with amazing videos
Bill wurtz who did 13 billion years in 25 minutes: I AM INEVITABLE
Science, the process of observing and testing evidence in the present, is much different than claiming that we have the knowledge of what happened thousands of years ago. Were any of the scientists there to observe sea creatures emerge onto land? Were they there to observe DNA, an information system, arise from matter? The fact is that we have never observed or tested either of these things, they are just guesses. Just like everything else they claim about the past. And these guesses are being made with the biased assumption that there is no God.  "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me if you have understanding. Who determined its measurements - surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? " - Job 38:4-5  "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse." - Romans 1:19-20  When you die you will live forever either with God or eternally separated from him. We have all broken God's moral law, The Ten Commandments. This makes us all guilty, and every human on the face of the earth is guilty and heading for Hell. (Romans 3:10-20). But there is good news. Even though we have broken God's moral law, Jesus has paid our fine on the cross. (Colossians 2:14). All you need to do is repent and trust in Jesus. Then God will grant you the gift of eternal life with him (Ephesians 2:8).
Anyone else watching this high
Just make this about the 10000 show of the Earth's History?
I remember when that happened.
American Evangelicals: “but the earth is only 6,000 years old and dinosaurs and humans coexisted.”
This video would’ve been 5 minutes long if there weren’t so many unecessary gaps in between sentences 💀
Is it possible to get a version of this without music or voice over?
It doesn’t make sense
Thank you for an amazing ten years of art and creativity ❤, huge fan here.
You should do techno mixes, the music curation for this particular documentarie is choice, creme de la creme ❤❤❤
Great content as always. But I’m not sure I got how it suddenly started raining after the first 1000.000 years. Where did the water come from?
😮😮😮😮
stenian
This gives so much perspective! I know making this kind of videos takes a LOT of time but it would be absolutely amazing to see and show my students same kind of video about size of the milkyway or even whole observable universe. Love your videos <3
I watched the whole thing, it was riveting! ❤
i did not know i needed this the fact i actully watched the whole thing i really love this channel
Paleoarchean has some dope bangers!!🎶
This is sooooooooooooo good!
a bit boring, sorry.
I use this video to restore my attention span
they got the early orbit of the moon wrong
19.26 min, take it or leave it
Espectacular video, y aún más la música ❤
My father used to say, “When God gets up to use the bathroom, a few million years go by while he’s gone.”  Now I understand.
Humanity: Blink and you’ll miss it.
Apart from obvious great animation, the music is amazing.  Also, I miss SPORE.
Damn. Took me 1.5 billion years to hang up the washing.
Man this must have takennnn soooooo long it takes me like 3 hours for 1 second of animation and that’s if it looks at least decent  This should be on some app so you make money we shouldn’t get this for free
It's really fun to watch, try not to blink at all for the whole hour  !
Now do the universe!
Nice it was worth watching ❤🥰🙌 Goodluck
What an amazing trip to make while eating a pizza in my living room on a rainy evening. I was surprised to hear it took that long for the earth's core to form but I guess there was just too much activity going on down there up until that point for the heavier stuff to settle down.
Would love this for my 4th grade class in German. 😍
I blinked and have missed all the human history. 😂 Feeling very small with this magnitude.
This is your best video! Keep the good work up
And out of 4.5billion years, humanity has damaged the planet so much
I did watch the whole thing. I loved the living hell out of it. Thanks!
so beautiful
This is good for painting to. Thank you, I’m finding it relaxing and informative. Your digital art is really good as well. I’m not very good with digital art yet. Thank you for sharing!!
I kind of want a 24h version, or even a 1 year version! :0 But this 1h version with all the music is wonderful already too
it's a whooooole hour because of all the time in between sentences! for an adhder, this video is difficult. i want to finish so badly
If bill wurtz can do it, yall can too
I am not impressed being human now haha thanks for the video, great job, love it and shared it already ❤
It doesn’t matter. Just wow
I watched it all. The fck, this was an incredible travel
jeah, in general not such a good thing to mess with the biosphere or overall composition of earth atmosphere, since it took billions of years to develop ..
Cuhz dat waz Crazy Cuhz on hood Cuhzzy Dhz Loc
Omg this was awesome and very informative for peeps who aren’t well aversed with this science. Thank you so much the effort is truly appreciated and worth all the recognition ❤❤❤❤
Thank you🙏
can you guys make a course on how you make these animations? would be really helpful...
I'm imagining the team who edited this video in every second and I was surprised by how brilliant you guys are. I appreciated everything that you guys made!!!
it would have been awesome of surface and ocean temperature and variations have been mentioned.
Making things up as you go? Your misinformation must be stopped.   Prove any of these statements
Can't believe I actually watched the whole video ... I thought I would never do that but i was eager .
Makes you realize the astronomical odds that led us humans to all be here today...
Thanks Kurzgesagt for helping me write my reasearch paper about the science of life on Earth! Your videos are super helpful and your sources are sexy af i love you *big sloppy kiss*
I have been following this Channel since I first came across an older black hole or solar system video. This is by far some of the best content on YouTube. It has helped me through alot; taught me lessons, ignited my love of ducks and widened my curiosity. I hope you never stop what you're doing. ❤
As a transgender Christian Jewish womans olympic champion, i find this hard to believe.  A whole hour video of animation 😮
This would be great on wallpaper engine lol
When did I decide I was taking 1h of my day to watch this 😮 now Im 15 min in.. and feel like Im way too invested even to skip some parts! Oh well.. Ill have to postpone watching all the episodes of breaking bad for the third time 😅
For reference, in the time scale of this video, a human lifetime (call it 100 years) passes in 1/15000th of a second....67 microseconds
Watching it for the second time whole and third time partially.
This is absolutely amazing. I've always wanted to see something like this.
do you sell those posters in a smaller book?
I realized just now: at 1:00:00 there are kind of squirrels on the trees. They could be Purgatorious, our grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-......-grand-grand-...-grand-grand-grand-......-grand-grand-grand-.......-grand-grand-grand-.......-grand-grand-.....-grand-grand-grand-......-grand-grand-grand-grand-.....-grand-grand-grand parents
Incredible work
in the beginning god created
In the Tonian there was no ozone In the Cyogenian the earth was frozen The Ediacaran set life in motion For the Cambrian explosion  Life got bigger in the Ordovician By the Silurian you could go fishin In the Devonian we went on a mission On land to find room for growing and wishin  The Carboniferous was fantastic For giant bugs and oil to make plastic Permian creatures were weird but classic And dinosaurs evolved in the mid Triassic  In the Jurassic came stegosaurus Trex lived in the Cretaceous, roar! And they might've grown more and more when crash! Went the great big meteor  Earth got hot in the Paleogene For the biggest snakes you've ever seen The ice caps formed in the Neogene And in the Quaternary came the human beans
This would be an insane live wallpaper on a computer
45:01 Hey atheists, this who you should moan to. Thank you😂😂😂
This video was awesome! Soooo good for understanding the true timeline of everything Earth and just how long it all really took. Thank you @Kurzgesagt !!
Makes religion look irrelavant
"We hope you felt something watching this" Yeah. I felt an hour of my life passing away.
Fake, this is clearly propaganda
45:03 This caught me so off guard
Fascinating, but I got a admit, I double timed it.
Loved it
This must be really great to watch when one is stoned.
I watched this with my 4-years old nephew, Isaac for the whole one hour and I hope this video does give him the power to stay curious!  Surprisingly he sticks to the whole course, and how cute right to have kid of such age asking a lot of Why questions about world.
I imagine the DJ riding on earth like in Mad Max movie.
Shouldn't the moon rotate in the beginning? IIRC the moon synchronized with earth roration later?
"The floor is lava" 😂
the effort is crazy
The art and music in this video were phenomenal. However I don't think the VO did it justice. Far too many times I felt like the information given created way more questions than it answered. And since this was a 1h video with very little VO in general, some of these could certainly have been answered with little to no impact on the videos vibe.
Why do I always get these recommended when I’m not sober😭
So when did god stop by?
guys i finally got to the sex update!!!!
I've been sleeping to this on Loop for the last few nights.
What's funny is that humans only existed for 200 milliseconds of this video
I would love to have this as a screensaver.  Does the progressive stages that the earth went through, before life began, show a teological course?
cool
I was able to spot the place I live in this video, exactly at 41 mins
The best YouTube channel, and the best video of the history of the channel
The rain part! Im confused
WE GETTING OUT OF THE DYSON SWARM WITH THIS ONE 🔊💯🔥
4.5 billion years just to get taxed to live here
Thank you for this amazing video.. I was at the edge of my seat.. so gripping ❤❤
This was truly mind-blowing to watch and done so beautifully. This has been my favorite youtube channel since I found you guys in 2020. Happy 10 years Kurzgesagt!!! 🎉 Thank you for inspiring and educating and giving me existential crises on the regular 🫶🏼
i can use this whole video as a science lesson. ill grab my coffee :) and thanks! :)
I love how the earlier themes have the hadean aka the floor is lava as a light motiv while its slowly evolving and evolving to a different theme  i have a question is the planet venus in a permanent version of the hadean of does it have its own eras and ages  and is there in the future a video from times like cavemen and then WW1 then the present then the far future because that would be a cool sequel to it
Absolutely amazing!
Aliens is not in the mood now 😔
These graphics are insanely mesmerizing! Nice job!
This is without a doubt the best channel on YouTube, seriously.  I can't thank you enough for all this work that you bring to us for free. It really is insane.❤
hot tunes time bandits  .. i used to watch these with toddlers .....now there at uni ....thanks for help making my dreams come true ....much respect DAn
Amazing. Thank you!
To believe this guy knows how old earth is and that it is over a billion years is a testament to how dishonest and prided he is and how ignorant and gullible those who believe him are.
The fact that im in awe when knowing someone born around 1900s, thats like 120 years ago, and this vdeo said, we've witness things happend in billions years..  billions..
bill wurtz feelings
I was so moved when the person representing all of humanity turned to look at me.
the animation... omg... i would wanna pay for this
This really makes you think how in just the short time humans have been on this earth we have destroyed billions of years of progress…
I love how I went from putting this on in the background to do homework but instead kept getting distracted and watching the whole thing😭
Amazing!
Only a minute I and I’m already mesmerised by the beauty of this animation, constantly reminding me of why I love this channel
Why does this video need to be 1 hour? 45 min of it are literally useless and repetitive with no narration..
Hands-down one of the coolest videos on yt
I've been sitting here for what!  13:43
It took me 50 million years to write this comment
I never knew that the floor is lava is so old!
this video is probably one of the best things i have ever seen  im watching the earth grow up, and seeing life transform into something familiar, once the video goes into the cretaceous era, it gets so serene and peaceful, esepecielly with the words "we are almost home"       the earth is so beautiful
This is simply put one of the most amazing videos I have ever seen and certainly one of the best productions on YouTube. The amount of love, effort, dedication, detail that went into this is stunning. Thank you!
The music is also good 👌🏻
The fact that we are 1sec of the earth history.
The animation is amazing, the dedication insane, but I also have to give props to Epic Mountain as well, they out did themselves with the music for this video, I actually think 'The floor is lava' is the best song i have ever heard from them.
you should do one for the universe!
I love how the human part was literally only a second . Puts life into perspective
Amazing! Which drone did you use to fly and record for 4.5 Billion years?
Let’s be honest guys. The earth fell off 2 billion years ago. The simple yet charming premise of single cell life evolving on an ocean planet made it stand out. Then the devs then tried to milk it for all its money with all that convoluted eukaryotic bullshit.
I feel like the beginning of life on earth should have gotten more than a few lines followed by millions of years of silence.
This video is roughly 0.0000000222% of 4.5 billion years.
Omg since 2019!?! You deserve every bit of sucess!!
What song is used in the cretaceous period? I couldn't find it on epic mountain...
I love you kurzgesagt. You are perhaps the most amazing thing to come out of these 4.5 billion years. Thank you for the blessing of this amazing video while I eat my takeout. ❤
Mars I would like to one for Mars
Amazing video! Didn't know sex was invented by algae 1.2B years ago
my favourite part was year 492839842 on 28/4 at 15:20:33
what was the tempeture in the eoarchean chapter?
I'd prefer to live in the Hadean era, it's my favourite atmosphere.
Don't blink, I blinked 2 times and saw the end!
BREAKING NEWS :  New date for 1st cyanobacteria, fossil discovery shows: 1.2 billion years earlier then previously known. ... you gotta do this video all over again ... ! ^^
Others: “I listen to music when I study!” Me: “A summary of the Earth’s life.”
🗣️: Which Movie Are You Watching  Me:
as a commuter, i think this is the only one-hour train ride i'll take over and over again
i don't know how this is free. thank you so much!
The accompanying soundtrack is luscious....
Thank you
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Hello sir , but you didn’t introduce the rain and the lightning-how did they come about. Please Can anyone enlighten me
I’m staying up to watch the last billion years.
And do fungi things 😂
Neat-o. Soothing too.
People you are insane, I love it!❤
I gae up after 5 minutes due to the terrible music
ça commence mal... 1.500.000 année / s x 3.600 s = 5.400.000.000 années et non 4.500.000.000 années
You're awesome, thank you for creating such a wonderful video!
45:02 💀
This is gooooooooooooooooood
This video was awesome! Soooo good for understanding the true timeline of everything Earth and just how long it all really took. Thank you @Kurzgesagt !!
Amount of detailing 💥 hats off
I'm just part of life's  creative self expression and diversification... Humans may just be a phase..
There is so much i could comment about how great this video is, but I don't know what, there is just tooooo much.
It's like listening to a progressive/experimental music band album with bits of lyrics amongst long instrumentals and a great finale. Cudos to the music guys! Quite of an experience, I must say.
This reminds me of “history of the entire earth I guess”
This vid always makes me so sad for the life in the cretaceous period.
Outstanding
i think it miss the stromatolithes first recorded apparition, 3.42 billions years ago, the first life we have proof!
they are best
this need to have an award
Brilliant❤ thank you
This video got me wondering about how multicellularity arose from unicellularity, and the imagery of all the rain made me ponder if multicellularity arose as some sort of adaptation to resist being carried away by precipitation and dying on land. Unicellular life near the surface of the primordial oceans might have been carried up by evaporation and rained onto land where it would die. Microbes that happened to be bound together in some way might have been heavy enough to resist being evaporated and over millions of years and various other factors maybe this led to multicellularity. Idk I'm high lol
crazy how you can fit 4.5 billion years into one hour, time really does fly
Love this video life is so precious and incredible wow
It would be insane if someone uploaded this in 4k to wallpaper engine wink wink please
Thank youuuuu

This is a stupid, low effort video. I don't know why so many people are congratulating you, these must be paid views and comments. This is poor content
Source: trust me bro
This is by far one of the best videos I've ever played on youtube
Thoroughly enjoyed this ❤
Sorry but i watch in 30 min 😅 2x
I literally can sleep after watching this
What are you waiting for like this amazing very very hard worked video
What made the rain start? Absolute amazing video though
You know what’s crazy probably one of those things are probably our ancestors
❤😀👌
oh shit!!! i blinked and missed all of human history!!!
Could not love this video more!
1 hour animation is a huge feat man love you video's
___m_/ o o \_m___ Might be good for a screen saver to play at work to keep my computer from hibernating.  The first viewing all the way through at 2.0x was pretty good.
and then it started to rain.. and it didnt quit, for Millions of years.  —Forest
hundreds of millions of years of near infinite surface area of scientific chemical experiments on prebiotic compounds with enough heat energy to try anything.  life is everywhere no doubt.  they just dont have a radioshack like us..  oh wait, we lost radioshack so thats possibly great filter
That poster should be in schools. Im seriously so inspired and in awe by this video. I live in a low income/low funded school area. Im going to save up some cash to buy and donate posters to my local elementary school. Thank you for the passion project ❤
To think, higher life forms came about by consuming the waste of lower life forms that came before them....  In the beginning, I always wondered if the floor really was lava. I mean with the absence of an atmosphere, wouldn't the vacuum of space cool the top layer into a thin crust faster? Or is it the opposite, where the vacuum of space lacks the heat transference needed, keeping the rock hot longer?  And I always love doing fungi stuff... don't you?   Awesome video as always!
I still have their app (The Universe in a nutshell) on my phone that I purchased years ago and love to visit from time to time. Brilliant work guys thank you
Im scared to blink and miss a million years
turn to lord jesus
Our existence came just recently and we think earth is ours nd our religious god has created this entire world😂😂.. we are creator of other things so we think we are created by the god..
Please please please please, make an app where we can scroll through earth history like the smallest to biggest universe scale ya'll made. I'll throw money at it immediately! 😊
We are not even a small pin in the huge sack of hay of this gigantic & diverse universe and vast period of time that has passed and many more millions of years that may come after us…feels super unreal sometimes!!
I can’t imagine doing something like this with the cosmic timescale from the Big Bang to now. Each second would have to equal 500 million years. Even at that pace we would miss all the decoupling of forces within Plank time. But it’s all fascinating. Thank you
13:22 why does it sas 3.6-3.2 billion years ago but then when it continues it says 3593 „Million“ years ago, can someone explain?
Everything was created by God,  aka the holy lord spirit . Read the HOLY BIBLE!
Came here for the history , stayed for the musicz
Did the univers sound this good
This IS one of the best things i haver ever seen and heard, this was fantastic, hans down. ❤️👍🇩🇰
i love u guys! thanks a lot
Oh yeah. THAT'S how it happened. 😅
@kurzgesagt was this music during the Mesoarchean period made to sound like The Ocean? It really resembles their sound and if so that is an awesome homage. Especially since they are from Germany as well so it would make a lot of sense to have the connection
Is it 10 hours version insists?
This video is useful for English learners like me. Thanks a lot
"May wokeness never touch our beloved Kurzgesagt", - on behalf of all the fans from poor countries whose currency is worth shit that's why we can't contribute much other than love.
No
Can someone make sure Ken Ham gets to see this.  I think he'll love it.😂
If this is true, why did the moon had not the same outcome?
Loved that, thx! Don't suppose you might have a "Edited Highlights" version of that, that I could show to some kids? That would be amazing and would save me having to learn how to drive a video editor! :)
Thanks for giving us a video track to The Ocean's Precambrian masterpiece album. (the Epic Mountain soundtrack is also absolutely lovely)
Thank god there is a magical Button called Fast forward ⏩😂😂😂❤
this is a masterpiece, a version without voice (only music and video) is mandatory, pure art
Please release the soundtrack for sale.
I did like it very much, but you could have varied the music a little bit!
the last sentence.......
Certainly excellent stuff, from the perspective of a geology enthusiast.  One humble request - for one needing to get on with other things and have it running in the background, include subtitles for those instances where you use a narrative to contextualise the images.  At the moment, switching on subtitles doesn't show anything.  It would be great to be able to read the narrative as text without having to listen to the music.  Its good enough music, but I'm really here for the information.
🥂!
This is the best video I have ever seen😊❤❤❤❤
felt in a rave
Time of insects next? :D
Did the narrator voice the 'How it's Made?' tv show? 🤔
i like your video but straight off the bat your wrong, like so wrong your saying the moon was made by a meteor impact, but if that was so the moon would be made of the same materials as the earth is, but we have been up there and tested the moon and its makeup is nothing like the earth, so that infers the moon was created in another way, not by a meteor impact, and none of us actually know at happened so you shouldnt say this is what happened, you should word it like we believe this is what happened lol, but still the video is very good
Haven’t seen this on here yet but shoutout to the music producer on this vid. One hour soundtrack that keeps its origin yet changes with every single time period..
One of the best videos I've seen. Ever
this is amazingi love your vids my most favorite is the ant ones!
Humanity like an asteroid to me, but SOME Humans are like Gods. And you know who I'm talking about **bows before Kurzgesagt team*
Amazing
The secret of nature?                  Is p  a  t  i  e  n  c  e
Sure is an awful lot of I think or we think and theory in this. None of the theories in this video even consider an external Force seeding life
i watched this while baked. lets go
It is 1 hour AND 3 minutes AND 31 seconds AAAAHHHHHHHH
I thought this would help me sleep but it was too interesting
This is actually insane, I’m not watching it yet but I’m 100% looking forward to watching
Great idea let down by some extremely irritating music. I'd love to see a version with commentary and relevant sound effects but no music.
I need the tracks from around 3:00 to 24:00
❤
Thank you so much for making this!
So much more interesting than God made everything in 6 days!
What if A.I. did this in just 2 minutes 💀😢
false
Never-mind. I keep getting the Siderian mixed up with the Siluran. 😂
So I’m confused. The Great Oxidization Event happened in the Silurian? I thought it was before the Cambrian.
This was much much better than my school, even 1 day isnt enough for he, but this guy?, Not only make it shorts also still have the important information and also make it fun in same time
WHO blinked an eye?
Love these videos
A piece of art.
You guys are insane! Wow, thank you for this amazing piece of art!
@kurzgesagt Is the music after 55:55 also available? The soundtrack linked ends shortly before :/
Nah bro the devonian soundtrack didn't have to go that hard!
Can this possibly reach 1 billion views?
All that time for the Earth to get where it is today, yet we have been stupid enough to create weapons that could destroy most of it; including ourselves,  in a matter of hours....
The music and animation kinda remind me of Chrono Trigger the Super Nintendo game lol
Dumb question but where does the water/rain come from in the Eoarchean period
If you’re lucky, you’ll live to be 100 years old. Every second passing in this video is equal to one million years. That means your life is roughly 0.00000001 of a second. Your life is pretty much worthless.
The creativity of this channel is unmatched ✨Impressed Af✨
But the Bible say the world was created in 6 days... and the 7th day he rested. Im confused 🤔
All of that just to say God did
Who else noticed the moon getting further away?
I never comment but this is one of a kind ✅✅
This is the most life changing thing I’ve ever seen, truly amazing!!
Couldnt beat bill wurtz' speedrun
I hope you have YouTube Premium for this one only way to watch.  👀
Jesus is lord
Thank you so much ❤
we have no clue how the moon was made... this is B.S
Im disappointed most of this animation is just idle repetitive things. They could've made a more compact 30 mins video that's easier to watch, im getting bored. Sorry guys, your videos are exceptional, but this one is just boring..
This video is glorious and I will never tire of watching it
Very cool! Must've been a lot of work
i wanted to learn about the earth not watch 10 min straight of techno music and geothermal vents, can’t even skip it cuz i miss the tidbits of information…didn’t even have to be an hour long
Why would it start raining if there was no water on earth?
Props to the cameraman for standing around for 4.5 billion years for an hour of entertainment
I know this is going to be something i re-watch quite a lot, but can i just point out i freaking love how when something is happening that has been shown in a previous video the music plays a similar theme like the terraforming Venus theme at the Mesoarchean period, goodness i love the music in these!!!!
Best video so far, @kurzgesagt ! Amazing Job!
Guys you are really amazing! Thins kind of visions music and info are perfectly put together in this video! What an amazing channel!!!
Bro chose the most beautiful color palettes for each stage
It's absolutely amazing 💖
Make another version of this video with a reversed logarithmic timescale.
This was awesome, thanks!
more expedited version of this fatboy slim "right here right now" ⏩
Terrible video speed it up this could've been 20 min. I get what u are doing but its boring and to he frank unwatchable
This would be fucking wild as an EDM set
To say this is fact is to be anti-science
All of your scenes are very breathtaking! The Eoarchean Era is my favorite!
Wow, This was great to have while I was writing notes about a book. It not too distracting but it’s not boring enough to leave. I love your videos and will end up watching every episode in one night, thank you, bye.
What a cool video idea! And the beats were sick 🤓
Wow..superb
4.5 billion years in 1 hour as far as we know today*
This was a work of art.  Standing ovation.
59:48
59:47
65 million years ego. Earth was destroyed by astrotid and all dinosours are dead
i'm back in this channel, the last i came here was 2 years ago because of the egg theory
Mesoarchean song rocks hard, sounds like Dream Theater. Loved it
Me: blinks *Also me:*   🥱🕹☄️🌍💥🔥🌋☠️🌌🌞💥🏴‍☠️
This deserves more views.
Thank you soooo much ❤️
Such a masterpiece!
58:14 nice jurassic park reference "life uuh finds a way" ian malcolm
We have come a long way is an understatement
Thanks for this. 🙏
How did you get the information from the start of the time
The sound design omgggg love it. Almost feels like im playing a game
🔥🔥🔥
Poor earth so many advertising integration in one hour
do the next one for entire universe 13 billion years
Thanks guys. This is an incredible heritage for humans that will be preserved most likely forever thanks to today’s technology. You’re the best ❤
Do a version without the words
Loved this so much
3:46 before a sick beat drops
Much hot
Crazy to think that life was made in so harsh conditions.
Imagine believing in god in 2024
Eat you Magic mushron, burn your joint, and enjoy
If you could maybe like drop the soundtrack that would be appreciated
The philosophical and theoretical idea of old earth theory is interesting to hear about
Daam I took a shower that lasted 1 billion years.
This is the most engrossing video I've ever seen...
Nice vid congrats
Music started slapping back in the Mesoarchean age.
Bill wurtz
Bravo 👏👏👏 beautiful video
Me vibing through the video while shazaming every second song 😮
Never been so engaged while watching a loading screen
1:37 is my favourite line ever
bill wurtz: i can do it in 18 minutes with a chipmunk and two inches of string
People rarely live past 40,000 days.
I dig the music, it was like I was at some upscale nightclub and Daft Punk was DJing.
Holy cow what a great video ! Thanks! ❤
This is 🤩
For millions of years we watch early organisms burp out oxygen for us to eventually, greedily suck up
couldve swapped the title for “a journey through Ohio” and I would’ve believed the footage
Getting this for free was awesome and I really appreciate this from you guys
The music really didn't have to bang this much
This has great music transitions, and that's really hard to make. Good job Kurzgesagt!
This is a work of art.  Such a great idea.
Man you know how when you're bombarded by astroids for a hundred million years, can relate
There's ultimate form erased from history ....it have 7th sense lives in night 😅only
a detailed video of timeline on "Sapiens" book.
Such talent deserves some kind of award.
Amazing!
Such an amazing way to put the timeline into a more understandable perspective. No magic, no supernatural, no gods needed for our planet and universe to exist. Keep up the amazing work!
I could see a creative science teacher using this as a 'rave lesson' after kids do a good job on test
45:00   I will never forget the Stenian
Not sure why I watched all of this in one sitting in the dark
Should have adjusted the time to the narration, not the voiceover to the set time.   Graphics are good but not THAT good to just stare… lol otherwise I do love the content. Just ummm, kind of boring this one. Was hoping for more facts
Wow! I just can't believe I watched the entire video with full attention and didn't even realize how time flew by! It was so captivating and enjoyable that I just couldn't keep my eyes off it! 😍
Wait wait wait…. So you’re telling me the earth is gonna go back to being a ball of lava 😢
Took me 2,e9 to take a shit
1:36 the most epic The Floor is Lava game in history!
What a treat! Great music as well. Thank you!
CONCLUSION: God’s Creation
You make the best videos ever❤❤❤❤
so much information you could include, but you decided to let it just happen with absolute silence
Seriously this should be a part of education process at a school or even at a university.
I cant thank more ❤
ABSOLUTELY INSANE thank y’all so much 🫶
Happy 12,024 HE🎉!!!
spectacular!
Watching this at 11:00 so it ends at midnight on new years 👍
2024
Hey, can we get the posters even larger? They are amazing but not big enough
I really enjoyed the Tool part
So where do saltwater in the sea come from if everything was hard magma before it started to rain?
Чушь собачья. Люди не знают что было 200 лет назад. Но они любят красивые картинки и сказки, поэтому их тела послужат удобрением, а их души я сожру и обращу в рабство.
Innocent question, why this only happen on earth, and not on other near planet like mars...?
Such an eternity to create the right conditions for life, and in a such tiny fragment of time we are destroying everything just to get "the things" that already are provided...
Its a great video,but sometimes the random "boss music" kills the mood 😮
“Extend their tubular arms, and do fungi things” 😂💛
Fun fact the Pope agrees with evolution
am i the only one who thought their phone was ringing in neorchean 😭😭
and fun fact.. there is still no god. this is just a natural  process of how things turned out. call it random call it whatever you want. it is what it is.
this is genuinely one the most beautiful videos on this platform. kudos to the animators. they did a great job👍
აქ ვართ
This is your "um-teenth" reference of DOOM 23:14 😅
104 degrees fahrenheit 19:05
There is a really good video on YouTube called Mankind Rising - Where Do Humans Come From by Naked Science that does an amazing job showing the evolution of humans from a single cell in the ocean until today if anyone is interested and hasn't seen it yet 🙂
Tonian music was fire.
I have never really seen something like this, but I'm glad I did. It was amazing
If I had a dollar for every year the Earth exsisted, I would still have a hundred and sixty billion dollars less than Elon
9:00 but if there was no water to begin with where did the rain come from?!!  19:15 there’s no oxygen in the air yet but there is water, microorganisms, clouds, rain cycles, gases, (like steam Im assuming) and the probability that photosynthesis may have occurred during that time…? But those all need oxygen don’t they?
What even is time?
How would one measure the passage of “years” without the Earth’s rotation around the sun … ?
How the fck you know all of this?😅
32:19 this music is awesome uahahaha
The fact that each team member has a unique bird makes me happy
Didn’t y’all see the end? They said they’ve been making this video since 2019
Now I know how sex is invented 😊
This is fantastic, thank you. Can I propose that a video be made on the 300,000 history of modern humans. If 1 second was the equivalent of 100 years, that would be a 50 minute video. Incredible to think that the birth of Jesus would take place just 20 seconds before the end.
45:00 Yoooooo sex 1 was released, its so good but when will we get sex 2?
With all the constant destruction and rebirth of earth it makes you wonder if we’re truly the first civilizations on this planet.
Keeping this to watch after I get high
The soundtrack at the end goes hard! We need that OST
“Earth is 4.5 billion years old…” 😄😄😄😄😄
No one talking abt how it took the fish 10 million years just to swim across the screen😭😂
If people really believe that they are deceived, you need to question the information that they want us to know, it will be for sure not the correct information becasue they have a secluristic point of vieuw that's for sure.
Mad lad
i don't understand what a 4D object looks like, please make a video about it
Last few seconds of the timeline..   human: 👁 👄 👁
I wonder how many tons of space rock must of landed on earth during all that time it was being smashed by meteors😮🤔
🫡🫡🫡
God created the earth, animals and humans✝️
The ultimate lore dump
Very cool! Thanks for this one
Amazing.  Thanks alot
how can i have picture-on-picture mode in kurzvesagt, but not on other vids.  But thats great though 😊
The music in this alone could justify its own channel, 45 minutes in you put in like a techno prog rock with poly rhythms that made me count it out to make sure it wasn’t 7/4, it was 6/8
Truly this video is a piece of art/history IN ITSELF. it really Made me think about all the people who are behind the scenes helping to make this video even be possible. Honestly I can’t even believe ti is free, this is something I would think should actually be paid for bc of all the time and dedication you can CLEARLY see through this video. Just purely amazing truly. Editing, animation, background etc etc. wow. Just wow. this channel is amazing and serves more attention than it already has I think. Not saying they don’t have a lot of people who already support but I think it should be way more even than it is now. If now 5 times that. But hey that’s just me 👩‍💻  Honestly I think this is the only video I have watched all the way through that is this long, I am not the kind of person who likes really long videos unless I really am Interested in whatever it is. So if that says anything take it for what you will. 🥇
This video is a literal Art piece just digitally, amazing. Since 1,250,000 years pass each second in this video as we are watching I think it would be    S O    C O O L  IF YOU MADE A SEQUAL OF SOME KIND TO THIS But instead do the past 1,250,000 YEARS IN ONLY     O N E   H O U R   🤯 so like 300 something years passing each second we watch??!  (Sorry not that great at math 😂🥲🤠)    YALL TAG HIM  PLEASE 🙏🏻
Awesome Video, Team Kurzgesagt. Need Historical Video on Sapiens too.
The only channel I actually donate because yall deserve it, please don’t ever stop making videos😭
the mesoarchean did not have to go that hard on the soundtrack
Great job!!
This is my favorite of my favorite videos of yours.
Where's the rain come from in 3925 Million Years Ago?
Can I get That on wallpaper engine ?
Loved this video! I wanna know if anyone else felt a strong TOOL influence in some of the music? Wondering if that was an intention of the creators. Truly brilliant content, well done! Looking forward to more :)
This journey was amazing! Thank you for your hard work. ❤
Ive just seen Mark Robers comment and it got me thinking, a Collabs between the two channels would be legendary
What was it like to be the cameraman
So where does adam and eve come in? Lol
Puts things in perspective doesn’t it? We humans feel like we’ve been around for a very long time and that nothing will dethrone us as masters of this planet. Crazy to think we’ve only showed up in the last second of a 1-hour video about the entire history of the Earth. We’re NOTHING
Why did it suddenly FREEZE OVER in Rhyacian
Next episode: 4.5 billion years in 1.6 trillion hours
Earth Lore
❤❤
Just beautiful! Thank you <3
imagine a game like subnautica but hadean
Bill wurtz
the soundtrack is a bop
So that’s the entire history of earth, I guess
Lovely so creative Thanks for the efforts.
Christ is king, this isn’t true.
Is this the best YT video ever created?
omg. they really did it
Top comment. Nothing is free. If its free. Youre the product. At least most everyone knows that. Human product.
Why does it say 4500 million years ago and not billion at the beginning
Ectasian song is dooooooooope
The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful...sounds like Puscifer, Tool, Primus...my influences to be a musician in high school.
1.5 million yrs at 2x speed 😎
Imagine dismissing all of this and just saying: God made everything and i don't question any of it.
I wonder how showing this to my earth science and biology high school students would go over.
8:04 These moments reminds me Kurzgesagst's videos: "Life & Energy", "The Most Complex Language" 41:40 Bacteria Size 57:40 Dinosaurs Looks Like... 59:48 Wow, "Dino Asteroid"!    1:00:38 So many many videos explain this moment! For examples: Homeopathy, Egoistic Altruism, Marijuana, Plastic Pollution, Meat, Beauty, Organic, Loneliness, Trust Kurzgesagt?, Vaccines, Is the EU Bad?, Is Meat Unhealthy?, Electro Smog, Immune System 2, World War Ant, Deep Sea, Ant Megacolony, Nuke A City, Dissatisfaction, Overpopulation and Africa, Milk, How to Kurzgesagt, Cancer Paradox, Corona Virus, Forbidden Cave, Who's to Blame?, Intelligence, Alien Scale, Weaver Ants, Climate Doom, The Human Era, GeoEngineering, Mind Upload, Nuclear Death, Nuclear vs Climate, Black Holes, The Tail End, Immune System, Giant Virus, NO*, You Are Immune Against Every Disease, Meat Love, We Lied to you, We Will Fix Climate Change!, Brain Eater, How to Change, Lyssa Virus, Make More Friends, Best Idea Ever?, Alaver Ant, What Actually Happens When You Are Sick?, YouTube-Money, You vs Cancer, Cancer City, Bio Nuclear, Variola Virus, Nuclear War, Why Korea is Dying Out, The Internet is Worse Than Ever, Living Tattoo
Thank you for teaching me more than school ever did.
no need for an hour long when there is a video by oversimplified lasting 19 minutes- "the whole history of the world i guess"
Bill Wurtz did it first
I'm filled with a sense of wonder.  I am so grateful for this video.  Thank you for making this masterpiece accessible.
Amazing Thank you!
This should have been 8 hours
My brain at 1AM:
You guys shoud make this so you can use it as a wallpapper
You guys are aswome i mean 4.5 billion years condensed into one hour is just crazy 🔥
I gonna watch this again with Fatboy Slim Right Here Right Now in the background 😍
1:00:45  OMG HUMAN
this is just awesome
I left a comment on this video when it first came out, but I'd like to make another comment as I've just realised that this video is a great thing to have playing in the background (as our narrator just suggested) while I'm writing or doing other chores, because I get beautiful music (that reminds me soooo much of the Donkey Kong Country industrial levels, especially the mine cart levels), AND my letting it play helps you guys! :D Happiness for all!
Excellent!
i need this as my wallpaper just rolling into the infinity
"Hope you felt something watching this", well I just cried a lot.
All lies
We should know how to make learning fun, Id rather watch this than my lecture vids :((
1:01:50 catchy music
Jesus says "I am the way, the truth and the life, no-one  comes to the father but through me." Turn to Jesus Christ today and believe the gospel so that you can be saved. This life cannot give you the peace and happiness that you are searching for, only God can give you that. Therefore choose this day who you will serve for tommorow is never promised to anyone. God bless you
This was only 4,5 billion years?! Felt like eternity
Great video. But honestly, such a missed opportunity for narration and more visuals showing gradual changes between the eons. It feels more of a slideshow rather than an experience of our planet's lifetime.   Keep going anyway. We still love you
I wish i had this at school. It's perfect
The Bible proof how the world even got made too, so this might be fake. But this video is epic to watch with so many crazy animations.
This would be a cool screen saver
Ill just tell my kids god created everything, this is too complicated to explain.
What bro means when he says ill be on in 5:
Are you planning to do a similar video about human history?
Damn.
End is the new beginning
Ok watching at 26dec 10 25
we have done more in the last 1 milion years than those 4.5 bilion years. make one from the last 1 or 2 milion years. and history etc.
This animated timeline is really neat. Just a quick question - How did it begin to rain at the end of the Hadean period?
Not flexing but i’m from earth
1 billion years of evolution and gta 6 is still not here
Love how the music grows more complex and "deeper".
Well done
18:35 Mesoarchean best song
I'm a geology student and I couldn't be prouder of this video. Such an amazing experience to watch our Earth's long and special history!
I love you.
@kurzgesagt really appreciate your work 🤟keep doing what your doing
This hour's music reminds me of Jean Michel Jarre's work!
I was literally talking about how human existence is a blip compared to the age of the Earth with my family earlier today. Perfect excuse to pass along the video to them. 😁
We really are new wow
Cool
Where did the rain come from?!
Human: Look what we achieved in 8000 years. Earth: I have some tiny minor skin problem.
Watching the credits and seeing just 2 people managing the audio for this one is phenomenal. The music is really cool, watched the whole thing and vibing because of it! The animations are also of high quality on top of that
Whoa what happened at 29:41 ?
Can we talk about Ethnoarchaeology in ways that explore ethnography, and the habits and customs of people and cultures.
this was amazing ! thanks
56:48 I love the music, it’s The Human Era leimotif
I love the animation and the voice, it’s like the animated National Geographic
U guys are the mvps of YT
Narrator dropping not only facts but the beat as well
Considering nothing has existed beyond 6000 years, this video is false and a total load of 💩. You will say “experts” and “scientists” say such and such and it’s written in a book. But God is almighty and God’s word is written in a book and on two stone tablets by God’s very finger. And no matter what you say your “experts” and “scientists” (whom God created) are useless and might as well be speaking Babel.
Your music is so cool do you have a album or a downloadable free file
I keep coming to this video only for its music
The fact that humanity didnt even get 1 second in an 1 hour video is truelly unbelievable!
Love you guys!
What’s really incredible is the perspective given by this video about how fast human development was and still is. Took literally billion of years for us to appear and become, and the current technico-logical advancement took only about a couple hundred years.  We truly are a marvel of the Universe, if not its biggest.  I just hope we’re smart enough to outrun ourselves in the sense that we don’t destroy ourselves as fast as we developed.
Best musical train ride ever! Love the beats !
Truely, one of the most amazing things that I've ever watched. Thanks for you effort. ❤
Pretty amazing. I just sat and watched the whole thing.  My only tiny piece of feedback was that after you introduced the size of the moon at the beginning, it didn’t seem to be consistent throughout the video- getting larger and smaller from section to section.
Getting extreme Tool vibes from the music at 47:00 lol
1 HOUR OF KURZGESAGT ??? THIS IS INSANE
Enjoyed this immensely team & particularly loved the Jean-Michel Jarre / Oxygene vibe to the music in the Hadean eon.
Shutout for the animators, this is awesome.
This video deserves more than 20million views
There could still be evidence of the Hadean period; I theorize that on the  moon we should be able to find evidence of this cataclysmic event if the theory of Thea and Proto-Earth colliding is true.
Have not one clue not one of how things were or worked that many years ago
I love y’all thanks for the video❤️
Awesome!
the history of the entire world, i guess But make it powerful and mind blowing
Simply Amazing
Thanks for the amazing journey Kurzgesagt <3
The earth is ancient, we are new ,  So New
super interesting because if you think about it, imagine something happens to the earth that causes a human crisis. and how might the future tell how we live.
This is pure art. the visuals, the soundtracks and sounds in general and in top of that some interesting facts. Thank you so much !!!
Loving the fact the earlier years are genuinely longer segments! It's all relative 😂  Also, the background music
they made some fire homescreen backgrounds
Incredible video. Really helps our monkey brains grasp how grand and ancient our planet is and how we should really respect and not take for granted our insignificant existence in the scheme of it all. Also the composer really outdid himself incredible music to compliment a truly incredible video.
Most Religious guy would say “lies” “god created everything”
God left the chat
Surprised we didn't see Doom Guy walking around the Mesoarchean with those guitar riffs.
NOPE !
NOPE !
they pulling a melodysheep on us
Bravo, Kurzgesagt. This video is beautiful to watch, lovely to listen to, and really does ram home how fleeting human existence has been so far.
you guys deserve all the best things in life
Watched it yesterday. I came back for the music. Love the Hadean theme.
Amazing!! Danke schön❤
cool
Well, in my opinion this is the worst video so far, it should have been packed with information for all the time its going on, its a total waste cause animation must have cost a ton ...
Background music artist ??
Unglaublich stark gemacht
Now i can say i want to skip some million years to look forward👀🤌✨
Roku wants your resumé so bad
This is amazing 😍😍 I found my new comfort video
Where did the dinosaurs come from??
Such a great little documentary! Very cozy and touching while being informative.
Shout out to the cameraman who hung in there all this time to get us the footage we see here.
wow
Came for the history but stayed for the music🎶
Speed of light is so slow when you compare it to the scale of time.
5 years 😨
I absolutely love this. Watched it all several times now and never quite notice the time passing. The combination of music, sound effects, and animation is so damn relaxing
I love this video!❤ thank you! Please post more...
This is as fantasy as atheists claim the Bible is. So who wins the argument?
0:51 Earth 8:42 water 13:22 Athmosphere 18:42 land Single-celled life  27:04 extinction  Single-celled life 28:03  30:35 gamma ray burst extinction  32:17 single-celled life  Multicellular life 42:18  57:18 dinosaurs  59:50 Chicxulub extinction  1:00:16 Apes  1:00:31 FIRE UP! Extinction  1:00:39 humanity 1.5 second Giving us what every single thing in the video happened
I'll try to watch it full, without skipping as an appreciation for the effort❤
Yes, but the soundtrack 😶‍🌫
I put this on last night to sleep to, and I fell asleep even before he started on how the moon came to be 💀 I conked out so fast
Its crazy that humanity wont live to a million years, if it was in this vid we'd just be in a blink of an eye even though SO many things happened.
pure theory
Profound work.  So much shock, awe, and wonder from this place we call home; it's terrifyingly beautiful.
Dang! 1:00:43 is really a deep and powerful message. 'Coz I thought, he'd be showing another timeline
I watched the whole video, great work 👍♥️
I gotta have some of this music on Spotify man, neoarchean gos hard
The realization that in 14 minutes I saw a billion years was insane to me omg
i fell asleep to this
I loved the vid, and would be FACINATED to watch a behind the scenes How It's Made or such!
Is this what happens when you fund a bunch of Demo Scene Nerds and give them science homework?!  F'n Amazing work.
The earth is really really really old guy
24:00 anyone else get a terraria cave soundtrack vibe?
I think this video really drives home the point that simple single-celled life is relatively easy to spring up. But multicellular life is a whole new level of complexity.
I want the music!!
"Earth is 4.5 billion years old"... lies.. you do not know that
That's clearly fake, where is the bearded magical man that shat out the earth and pissed out the oceans?
Cool und
where does the rain come from?
I love the soundtrack.
When the Mesoarchean Eternal soundtrack kicks in... You would basically Die immediately in this Atmosphere
What about now?
The progressive rock music wow guys brilliant
Then came the jews and everything changed 😂
Your videos have given me the excuse to watch your vids during school hours as "reasurch" ,and with every new vid i wonder hows the virtual reality game coming along?
It’s hard to explain how awesome and beautiful this animation is already 14:13 I’m only fourteen minutes in and it’s beautiful! I love looking at the ocean surface. It looks like a bunch of cells moving about. 24:31. Life is becoming colorful and beautiful ! 54:02. That was very fast, such a colorful animated experience! 1:00:53
Wir sind so ein Witz😂
🎶Taste the SUN!!!🎶
This is incredibly beautiful. Profoundly Awe-inspiring .
The ONLY video on internet people will watch on 1x or even slower
Hail  kurzgesagt and team
This is incredible, no other way of describing it
This shows me how ALLAH ❤ is the greatest thank you for this educational video I appreciate the effort
1:34 he said the magic words
Could you guys also make a timeline of humanity this way? I am really curious about this timeline in more detail as well 😁
An Amazing video, I was paying attention to every change, step by step until the end. Thanks you Kurz. I Yes, I ended felling some strange and nice feeling when we reach humanity.
This was soooo amazing ! Honestly almost teared up ehn mammal started developping on the last seconds thinking about all the time and crazy events it took to get there 🥹
..."and they do fun-guy things"
Dont we have "the history of the entire world i guess" for that?
Mesoarchean goes hard, got some Doom vibes ❤
Masterpiece, fascinating and also humbling. Thank you!
The thing that gets me… the hardest part to grasp so to speak… All of this had to happen, maybe you could even say this all leads to me here. You there. Today and now.  What are the chances? Why am I here today to experience it? How many other times has this happened??
4 years is so long i appreciate all your hard work just to teach us and entertain us❤
I`m hyped to see part 2 in 4,5 Billion years!  Can`t wait to see what those new humans are about.
Statherian & Calymmian have the best looks and music here!
This gives you an idea of how old the earth is compared to humanity
Really liked the Tonian music, wish the intense beat kept up in the later portion
the animation, the illustrations and the sound is all just amazing! thank you for this!
What is that blue thing at 31:37 ?
What an astonishing overview! I recently delved into this very topic and as such know that there are many more interesting details about each time period, though this tied it together wonderfully. Thank you!
That was amazing 🥹
55:57 the period where all the coal on earth was made
"in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
Oppenheimer should watch this before he cook that ball
Damn the Hadeon had some good house music
ty <3
The details in this are insane- props to everyone involved
The most jarring thing about our universe is the concept of time. For humans, it seems so finite and in the grand scheme of things, it is. The fact that humans have been around the equivalent of a fraction of a fraction of a second(in this video) is hard to wrap your head around
This is way too well-made for a free youtube video
Lol at all of the religious people coping in the comments 😂
it's your 10th anniversary? Happy birthday Kurzgesagt!!! Love youuu!
I’m mine is about 100 million years
Big shoutout to Bangiomorpha pubescens. Thank you.
Fake, not real
Love watching the history of our planet to some sick prog grooves 🤘 On the real this is phenomenal good job!
6.1 millions views but not even a millions likes. Come on y’all 😭
Danke liebes Kurzgesagt-Team, das war der Wahnsinn. ❤
Oh my God 😢
This is a piece of art
And here we are destroying our earth for meaningless squabbles. yes i said it OUR earth
What a bullshit
Este é um dos vídeos mais perfeitos que eu já assisti. Excelente trabalho!
Umm excuse me! Where is the rain coming from at the beginning?
Earth is 4500 million years old. We've been here for a small fraction of the time - roughly 2.5 million years - less than 0.10% of the age of the Planet, and we managed til the pre-industrial era, until around 150 years ago, when we started screwing things up pretty badly.
That was simply (und kurzgesagt) beautiful❤ Love it.
I’m not sure what I’m feeling, but I’m feeling *something*
We need part 2
OMG a one hour Kurzgesagt video?!?!? THANK YOU!!!
Try making a video of  1 hour in 4.5 billion years
I just finished my second watching. This is not just popular science - this is a piece of contemporary art.
Bro is banging GTA Nightclub music and I’m bout it
Beautiful video with amazing information! It was difficult to get through due to long pauses between narration for me. 😅
Amazing job! You should have the super thanks button 👍
The bling another video is coming lol
These songs are fire too
Thank to team work for video… u guys did a great job
I fall asleep to this hoping to dream about something and everytime I do.
good video
Thank you so much for all of your wholehearted dedication, it's sooo amazing to see what you provide with these videos, for free! <3
Wow
I live for 3:50
what caused the first cells to enter the planet
My ‘tism is tisming
4.5 billion years of making this tiny blue dot and we want to get out of it?
Bro ripped of bill wurz
Boop
It’s insane to me that there are still people who believe the Earth is only 5k years old.
where did the water came from?.
anyone knows music or dj that does this kind of music?
Cosmic road trip. I’m here for it. Buckle up.
And to imagine that your whole life wouldn’t even come close to a tenth of a second in this video
Bill wurtz did this in 20 minutes, that’s the great value version of this video
Ectasian had the best soundtrack
It's a miracle we're here. It took a long for the Earth 🌎 to become livable for humans. Life is one big mystery. Why not be kind to each other while we're here?
Wow, I'm insanely impressed. I have been watching Kurzgesagt for years now but this is a new level of amazing! Thank you for giving this to us for free and for taking so much time and effort into animating it so beautifully. I know this was intended to be an "in the background" video, but my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time, just fascinating. It's incomprehensible how long the history of our Earth really is, and how short we have really been here when compared to the many periods and events that took place before us. I absolutely did feel something watching this: awe, wonderment, joy, fascination, intrigue, and a general sense of existentialism (though, not necessarily in a bad way). I'm so glad to be alive during a time where I can bare witness to something as amazing as this video. Thanks again for educating us and taking the time to make it eye catching and beautiful as always.
Earth is gifted with such an advanced microcosm which could become even more advanced but unfortunately some people in “higher power” doesn’t think the same way and only want to make money. I know many examples where a “higher power” didn’t liked the idea that we could change the “system”.
The first animal in the world is sponges
I just watched everything... literally
I don't get it. It's just repetitive music with some animation and a sentence every 5 minutes?
i love the “war of the worlds” style music!!! it really fits this style of video!!!
Yall gone make me sleep, kurzg
It speaks to just how little I'm doing with my life when I'm actively watching this, eagerly anticipating the red bar filling up and the next stage of Earth's history commencing.
2.8 billion years ago, Earth is an incredibly hostile place. Boy I’m glad that’s not the case anymore…
What's nuts that we are capable of feeling and experiencing this through our Minds
Kruzgesagt, thank you! This is awesome!
The Tonian had the best soundtrack.
Love it!!!! Insane Work
Clouds existed during the Hadean period?🤔
The music god tiar
I definitely felt something watching this 🥹
Kurzgesagt is absolutely god-like content.  It's basically just this, Melodysheep, and a few others.
Sesat
Was that, or was that not, kurtzgesagt?
So, do religious people just ignore this stuff?
This is so cool
What song is at 59:16 please?
so, sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago in Stenian era. Got it
Ah yes, humanity. When lava, rain cold, and meteorites don't work, nature sends in its most deadly weapon of mass extinctions.
Halfway point is 31:45.5
Funny, I didn't even have time to feel sad for the Dinosaurs. As soon as they were wiped out, Mammals took their place. This taught me how we Humans too shall one day be gone and replaced with som other species, Intelligent or otherwise.   To think we make such bold statements like "We need to protect the Planet", Thinking we play a Major role. Its just s delusion. One day we are here, another day we are gone.
🌍⏰ "4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour" – A mind-bending journey through the eons! This video condensed the vastness of time into a captivating hour. I feel like I've time-traveled through the ages, from the birth of our planet to the present day. Incredible storytelling and visuals!
I always watch this to fall asleep
One of the boldest video projects on YouTube—bravo, Kurzgesagt!
Universe in one hour next
Wow 🤩
ok the Stenian period soundtrack is just Tool. I love whoever made this for you guys.  ok and Tonian. The drummer is so skilled. And if he's the one playing the other percussion instruments as well, he's literally Danny Carey. Those toms tho.
You forgot the part about my grandpa getting kicked out of the dollar general store
I loved the soundtrack. Especially during the Mesoarchean period. Danny Carey vibes
I love the fact that I missed all of the dinosaurs. I had it playing on the side muted while doing other stuff, I had subtitles on to grab my attention when stuff was happening, and for an hour I happily let it play, focusing on it whenever things were happening. And yet, after looking over to see the first dinosaurs appearing, I looked away, and the next time I looked back the dinosaurs were gone. It's truly such an amazing display of how long the earth has existed, and how short the time of complex life has lasted.  (Also, I'm gonna have to have it playing with audio some time later to make sure I get to appreciate more of what I surely missed this time. The animation is amazing as usual, and the concept of stuffing 4,5 billion years into a beautifully animated time-laps is such a fun idea. Great work as usual!)
Fantasy for grown ups.😂😂
What if this was God's pov
time stamp 18:34
The mesoarchean song did not need to go that hard holy shit that was amazing.
What a boring video. Zero info
I absolutely love this video
Where is Theia?It supposed to crash into the Earth a long time ago.
I just bought the calendar and I can't wait till it arrives!
Honestly, if they want to do a similar sequel, do the last 600 million years in an hour. That would be a million years each 6 seconds, which would be enough to show the various life forms of various times in more detail. 600 million years ago is just before the known beginnings of multi-cellular life in the Ediacaran around 575 million years ago, so it would nicely to show the entire history of multicellular life.
Absolutely lovely!
How can everything around me feel ao meaningful when Im rationally not more than a partical of dust.  Amazing video once again!!
Türkçe çeviri ekleyenden Allah razı olsun yaw keşke tüm videolarında olsa.
This is awesome. I’m gonna put this on every night
Will you make available the amazing soundtrack? 🙏❤️❤️
This is sooooooooooooo good!. Today just got a whole lot better..
Beautifull soundscapes and looping tracks.   Bit ruined to have the climax be "don't blink or you'll miss..." *ad*
Damn And to think, bill wurtz did the same in 20 minutes…
My question is how do you know this is really what happened😅
❤
The soundtrack for this is PHENOMENAL OMG
i didn’t even know that there is a Tonian era
The cameraman is the true hero
The quality of these videos and the amount of research and work that goes into them is unmatched. Thank you for creating things like this and making them available to everyone regardless of income. ❤
Where do you get your music
Greatly appreciate this content.
19:54 sounds like some light doom music lmao
Thank you and this giver a better appreciation of time and mother earth.  Great job!
I don't have words to say about it. Here's a like ❤
?when did the aliens arrive?
1:00:00 What is this track and where do I find it? I tried but I couldn't find it.
The soundtrack is too distractingly good
Will you put out a german version? This would be perfect for a geography lesson in school.
My son and I love the music
If anyone is aware of a 6 hour remix of this, let me know.
Crazy 💛
know what I feel after watching this? To die, and lives in the after life
This is exceptional. Thank you 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
David Attenborough can truly commit to jealousy after this video. Even he, himself, would be astounded to the chronological timespan of Earth in such a coordinated timeframe.
It all feels so dream like
completly insane, i absolutely loved it, every second, thanks
lol, funny lies
That was DOPE
Blue Man Group prepared me for Epic Mountain
All that makes me think that we are not "owners of the Earth". We're just a little part of the long long history of Earth, living yet in comfortable and calm conditions.  Nobody knows how much time is left for us. Everything will burn in fire.
Shoutout to the camera man flying in an extremely dangerous atmosphere just to show us what was there before🔥🔥🔥
Grand roy
Best trip will tripping thank you Kurzgesagt✨
Really cool but who is gonna watch this for that long? I wanna listen but I'm not trying to listen to elevator music while I drive.
Earth was a lovely planet, life and infants can be formed in planet Earth.  But, When Earth was born, it was a hellhole and the age is called "Hadean"  Hadean age had lava EVERYWHERE and life was dangerous, Earth (in Hadean form) cannot support life.  The End of the Hadean Age  Starting the age of Eoarchean  Eoarchean was not a hell hole, but there was rocks filled with lava, But rain started and clearing the lava rocks and turning them to obsidan.   The End of the Eoarchean age.  Entering Paleoarchean Age.  Paleoarchean age had Earth under water, Earth in the Paleoarchean age was just water, No ground, no human but there is some fish.  Paleoarchean Age left.  Mesoarchean Age Joined.  Mesoarchean age have now grounds, but they're weren't just normal land, they were continents, Water and Ground now formed in Earth  The End of the Mesoarchean Age.  Entering Neoarchean Age.  Now when going to the ocean, it's deep, close and shallow parts, When Theia crashed into earth, they formed the Moon (Luna) so that means tides have formed.  The End of the Neoarchean Age.  Entering the Siderian Age.  Siderian age had Oxygen (o2) and almost Earth can almost support life.  Entering the Rhyacian Age  The Earth is freezing to death because of the Rhyacian age, But volcanoes can keep the Earth warm to prevent global warming.  By the way this is too much ages, It will take me 20 hours to finish it, But if I reach 20 likes, I will give information.  Scientist Floppa out.
This is a staggering video. Just staggering. I'm shook.
Loved it. Is there a version without narration by chance?
i need to play this in super speed
If one puts the speed on 1.5 the music slaps.
where does the water come from?
Every frame of this video could be an awesome wallpaper.
Where are the tidal waves of lava after the moon forms.. fake news...lol...
Epic work!
Timestamps that matter: 44:50 sex is invented
The amount of times in this video alone where he says "we're not sure" is giving just a tiny hint on how much we actually don't know or haven't discovered yet. How much more is left that we have no idea about? Will we be finished with research one day? How many things are there today of which we think we understand them but actually don't?
i loved this so much lol please make more!
Amazing
53:41 ANOMALOCARISSSS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
How can you confirm or deny earths age when carbon dating and its analysis caps out around 50 thousand years accuracy? Just a guess hey?
So really this is the history of the world, i guess?
I blinked and missed the cool bit right at the end
Quality content as always!!!
My small doubt. Mellenials before oxygen forming  in atmosphere how did it rain first ?
This is so relaxing and healing after short videos on social media
Youre a gem of a channel guys!!!
The music took me places ive never been but feel so similar.
I never knew earth had such awesome music playing while it was developing!!
All of human history was only a second.  Dyou think l maybe why we haven't met aliens yet that it's because we might be the first self aware intelligent life in the galaxy?
Can you do a similar video for the history of the universe, similar to "Timelapse of the Future" by MelodySheep?
Sleeving cards for an LCG at the moment. Perfect background vibe
Watching this high really felt like i was watching a 4.5 Billion yea long video its incredible
This video + A couple good friends + Psilocybin = Absolutely wonderful conversation! This is amazing work, and I hope every individual who helped put this video together feels proud!
Thank you to everyone at Kurszgesagt. I love this video so much!
Gave me an existential crisis at the beginning of the video when you said 1,500,000 years pass every second of the video. It was insane to think about and it really put into perspective how unfathomably long the history of Earth is. Made my heart sink for a good 10 seconds
Love the vids! Man you people must be RICH
This... is.... AMAZING!
this is so cool omg
This was such an amazing video. I've been putting off watching because of how long it is lol Everyone has commented already about how understandably incredible the quality of this video is, but honestly it cannot be understated enough. There are a few loops of foreground or background tilings, of course, but crazy thing is each second is different, regardless of the video. It did not feel a single time like any frame was used more than once, and that's insane.  I wish didn't gloss over Zircons in the Hadean Period. They mentioned them, which was great, but I feel like it kind of understated how mind blowing it is that humanity has found evidence of pieces of crystal that are from it and the moon's original creation period, and that they were over 4.4 billion years old. We were watching this video at 1 million years/second. That's 100 seconds from the beginning of the animation.
Could someone please explain to me how we as humans know about what happened for the past 4.5 billion years ago 🤔........how do they know.....
The music and animations are just soooo gooood <3
We need a 10 HOUR version of this. This is so awesome!
This is a trip if you’re high
My question is Where that first bacteria came from if there was only lava (nothing living) what hemical reaction made first living bacteria
I love the beginning, I put the video on for background sound while studying and I am just vibing to the music to the Hadean
Sound guy don't get enough credit.. this video is a masterpiece!
This soundtrack is amazing! Taking me back to gaming in the 90s... Really enjoyed this video!
3:48 where the music really kicks in
"Thank you for being a reliable source of information in a world filled with misconceptions. Your dedication to scientific accuracy is truly commendable. "
Thank you for such an incredible effort in this video!   What i am curious about, is "has anyone ever tried to extrapolate the original coordinates in space and time of our planet and solar system from the beginning? Would something like that even be possible or practical?"
source that earth is 4.5 billion years old: your ass.
Insane! Can't imagine the amount of scientific research!
That was insanely interesting
According to the word of God this is not accurate, I'll choose to believe Gods word over mans, i choose to believe the creator over the created, what audacity for the created being too deny the creator about his creation
It’s jarring to think that in a video that showcases 4.5 billion years in an hour, it takes over 50 minutes to reach the Cambrian Explosion!
I respect that
I'm so in love for this channel, for years and years now. I started following since the beginning and it's still one of the most amazing things to watch around here. Thank you for all the knowledge for free, with such beautiful art! Congratulations from Brazil over here ❤
i'm gonna cry
Breathtakingly beautiful... Massive respect for this video. I litarily had goosebumps multiple times during the video..
Watching this made me realize, that we‘re just gonna disappear from this planet. Maybe we‘ll be remembered but we‘re just a little piece in this lifeline of planet earth and it‘s gonna keep existing without us.
This is my new favorite YouTube video. Already shared it with my friends and family. That was so awesome
It’s amazing to fall asleep and listen too
Incredible! Excellent, watched every minute of it. Good work!
In a nutshell....this is bullshit.
Anyone else reminded of Tool in some of the music during the Mesoarchean? Lol 19:30
It feels disrespectful to use this masterpiece as background noise. So much effort went into this. 3-5 years of it actually! (I have probably horribly miscounted that) Well done. I am lost for words. The sheer dedication. It’s admirable
Awesome video. Another great video would be the evolution of our moon.
Starkes Video 👍
Low quality animation probably took them 1 week max
Its interesting how modern human civilization didn't even deserve 1 second in this time scale😂
awesome, thank you
Whata snooze fest. Long pauses for what?!?
I love that for most of the time life was just hidden or non-existent lmao
This gave me Subnautica vibes
90 percent of it is literally nothing you didnt show or talk much
Cant believe I've watched the entire history of the earth. But the first organism to have sex piqued my interest 😂.
この映像も、ナレーションの方の声も、英語の発音も、バックミュージックも、勉強になる内容も、全部好き
I love this. I have this on regularly while I go about my day.
Bunch of garbage. Most can't be proven scientific. God will judge these false gods.
55:50 Taxes, here I come! (Who understands this?😂)
This is a great video. I wish include give 100 likes
Why does the moon become gigantic again in the cretaceous?
We are the past
I’ll show this to my future kids. This is gold. ❤ Thank you so much for existing!
Strong mushrooms
Wish there was more commentary on each period.. otherwise it’s just the same animation on loop for 2-5 minutes each cycle w no substantial explanation of what all is happening over that huge amount of time
I feel like theres so much information in the first sections that they couldve discussed. How the water got to earth, atmosphere formation, magnetic field
Hands down the best youtube channel, appy birthday guys
It blows my mind to think about how long prehistoric animals were around and how many generations of them existed. Even more so to think about the amount of time on earth before life and the fact that a single eyeball never saw it.
Put it in 2x speed, and it'll be 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes
Can you do sun's history
I'd so much rather idolize this than any form of power, don't see what religious people are yappin bout
The music is very Terraria inspired at some points 😊
44:59 SEX!
It took me 10 million years to type this comment. Amazing video as always Kurzgesagt!
This is sooooooooooo good!
Gj Kursgesagt, your second video that made me feel small, insignificant, hopeless and grateful 😅. I wish you merry Xmas and a happy New Year!
Yes but life doesn't just come from nothing
Lies!

This is insane thank you so much for giving us this for free ! Thank you to the animators editors and everyone else who worked on this love this channel loads ❤
It's wild to me that the Earth is 1/3 the age of the entire universe. At the soonest, the universe (age 13 billion) is predicted to end at age 22 billion. And that means we're over half-way to the end of all of time and existence.
Not sure if it's intentional or not, but I love the Terraria-esque music in the Cryogenian
<3
Now I can't wrap my head around this... How can we tell when the Earth iron core was formed? How did the fossil records change so scientist deduced that the core formed and didn't existed before this? 42:15
This is a cool video, it would have been nice to have in a corner of the video a zoomed-in view of the microscopic world to see what is going on at that level, in terms of single cell evolution, but still with the same landscape as the main video
I'm loving this video. The soundtrack is fire!
Thank you for the great educational video that must of taken a lot of time , money and work the full video is so god !👍
They should do this again but for the history of the dinosaurs! 🦕 🦖
That just shows how insignificant humans are to the timeline it’s very cool
crazy
Instrumental seems to be inspired from Weeknd's recent work and I love it. Amazing video.
Once in my college me and a friend both agreed on that the best way to teach history is to use each individual class period as a certain time frame, like one class for 100 years or 50, depends, to truly understand the sense of time in all decision made to lead to us now. This is exactly that concept. Brilliant.
Damn. Really puts things into perspective, huh? Multicellular life doesn't even show up until 45 minutes in!
Kurzgesagt's answer to "lo-fi chill beats to study to" - I'd love to see more of these like "evolution of humans" with cool music like this
If h believe in that ur nuts
i started the video at the lava planet and woke up to a black screen… damn i missed all the action
Must be in box officee sihhhh
The music is so good
The real answers you will find it in the holy Quran
Now I’m 100% sure life started in space and just landed here, what is out there?
Could you do a video on the history of humans and cultures?
51:09
Well done ❤
I came for a history lesson,  instead getting 1-hr surprisingly soothing meditation.
Damn this production is as epic as the 4.5 billion years of Earth
Make one for the universe too, 13.7 billion years in one hour.
I get that you guys need to make money so that you can keep producing excellent works like this. However, the midroll ads did feel rather disruptive to the experience.
The christians would disagree!
Thanks for the video
The first Track has no business being such a bop
I am stunned by what I just witnessed…. Found this channel through Instagram today, and happened upon this video…. I’ve been feeling heavy feelings lately, and nothing seems to help— even the things that have helped before. But somehow, watching this, I feel so lucky to be alive. That everything worked out the way it did and now I am here, typing this. I am a part of something great. I get to have life. 🤍
There are 6.5million views as of writing this comment, assuming everyone stayed to the end that makes for 742 years of human life spent on this video, given the avrige life span of humans this video has effectively killed over 10 people, so that's altest a bit interesting. Maby I should be doing what I actually need to instead of writing this comment 😬
This is just Earth Lore
HAPPY 10 YEARS !!!!
very cool, but You know what would be even cooler? If You would talk a lot and explain as much details as possible. I was just hoping to listen this while sleep, but there mostly just a music.
Can we just talk about how much of a BANGER this soundtrack is?
Can there be a version with just the soundtrack and animations? Could be cool to have playing in the background for a social or something
yk everyone's talking about the animating, but the BGM is fire. yooo, the album is only USD$7.55!! let's go
If a 20 min video takes months to be made , this one must’ve taken over a year ! , we appreciate your efforts so much! , keep up the good work
This is beautiful
The worst video made by kurzgesagt
History of the entire world i guess revamped?
19:52 giving me mick Gordon vibes
When you’re a billion years into a video and now you’re hooked and have to watch 3 and half billion more 😊
Virgin "4.5 billion years in 1 hour" vs. Chad "History of the entire world, I guess"
For the first bit, fake news, the moon wasnt tidally locked yet, and should jabe gone around in orbit so mich dlfaster than that!!      (Yes i am kidding)
Science is Mordern mythology.
Sound track for Mesoarchean goes hard tho
Brilliant
finally had the time and headspace to truly experience this Masterpiece, didn´t skip a sec   Thank you guys so much, we all appreciate this work  schönes Fest und auf ein weiteres geiles Jahr mit schönen Videos
Did I just blink and missed my entire history from when I first emerged and took resemblance of an ape to taking my modern shape and structure. From the beginning of my stone age to putting seeds on the ground so I can grow my food and my community till to now as in right now the technological era. WOW!!!🤯Thank You Kurzgesagt for this video👍
It'd be amazing if you guys made human history in 1 hour video for your 15th anniversary 👀
Who did the music? Sounds like a DJ set 👀
Except the moon is completely different rock and soil than found on earth. Probably not of the same origin planet
the music for 20:12 has no right to go as hard as it does 🎸
wow this Video is amazing! thanks a lot
this was so cool i watched it all 😂
Houve uma aproximação e uma fastamento da Terra em relação ao Sol...
Pelo vídeo eu entendo que o fogo se transformou em rocha, é isso? A rocha que virou a terra que é hoje...
So, if we are to extract a lesson from this video, is that single-cell life might be abundant and not a difficult development in a planet with the right conditions. Multicellular life, on the other hand, took about 3.5 billion~ years to develop, which may be one of the reasons we haven't spotted any other life forms close by. For all we know, they could still be in their pre-multicellular life stages, and we have no way to detect them or knowing if they ever got past that stage (mass extinctions are quite the thing, apparently).
Despite having 6.4 million views in a month, this is STILL underrated.
Where did the cells come from? I know I'm not the smartest guy out there but come on man how does something more complex then a city just form from rock and lava? Genuine question guys, I'm not trying to be an ass.
14:30
Purely in terms of animation and music, this is Kurzgesagt's magnum opus. You can pick any random timestamp in the video, capture a still, and it would make for a gorgeous wallpaper.
Most well spent hour in my life 😂😂😂
Well, now everything is moving to the right.
Oh I do hope this reaches 20 million views
Ngl this would make a good screensaver
Always incredible
I have no idea how I got here, but it took me 100,000,000 years to write this message
Projected this on my ceiling and ate about 4g of shrooms then watched this with my kittens and a bag of dried mangoes. Incredible
Wow Kurzgesagt, this is incredible! Is there anyone on your team interested in history? I can only imagine what y'all could do with a history channel
ALL HAIL THE DUCK
You are fucking nuts,awesome
i swear as soon as 6:48 comes across, the animation including the asteroids just multiplies in intensity 🔥
loved this video
This channel should be shared on fridays in schools, and have students and teachers debate ideas after.. would be a solid blend of new gen information sharing and schools.
We're actually studying this in science rn, and my teacher sometimes plays us videos in class, so I'm definitely sending this to her
Better than any movie
A Clorox ad made me miss all of the history of primates
Nothing is scientific proved in this video. Just fairy fale and believe.
This animation is probably soo long that, by the time the video ends, the POV has went all around the earth.
i would love to have an ambient version of this, where it's just the music and animation without the narration. it would be perfect to study to
So earth went from lava to a beautiful landscape?? How can a human who only been on earth for approximately 60 plus years minus childhood years and young teen adult years determine the earth has been for 4.5 millions of years. The English language alone has only been around for a few thousand years. And I’m being nice saying that, let alone an earth  forming itself from asteroids. Geeez
So fascinating, so beautiful🥹🥹🥹
This video is a masterpiece. Always coming back & running in loops
❤
Nice Jurassic Park reference 👍
I have dreamed about it today, I saw all those things as a abstract entity, was beautiful dream. So I searched google for some video that simulate that and found this! If I can like 4,5 billion times I would.
You people at Kurzgesagt are definitely incredible! This is incredibly amazing! I thought it would be hard to watch for 1h and here I am, hypnotized..hehe
I've been watching nearly every video from Kurzgesagt since the "Neutron Stars Explained" 9 years ago, and this is it, this is the pinnacle of the channel, this is your Symphony No. 5, guys.
❤
is narrator the same guy who narrated national geographic?
There’s something so healing about this. How trivial all the things I’m worried about are, it’s wonderful it is to be alive.
45:01 BIG MOMENT GUYS
My grandson and I watched the whole video.  He was amazed as was I.  He asked so many questions ... Thanks ... great job! 👍
"We are almost home" I cried😢
Hello, may I know what are the smokes in the Ectasian period? Nice video tho. I watched through the hour. I love it. 😍😍😍
this is so beautiful and i loveit so much!
Its a shame that alot of time has been spend on a video that not a single person has fully watched without skipping a single second
What will happen in the future ?
The Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented the most useless thing for me
I love how people think they know what they clearly don't.  Theories, guessing lol fuckin aye
Hi, you are on a rock floating in space. pretty cool, huh
Why do you guys lie about this stuff
This is amazing! Thanks <3
i wonder how many times life tried to emerge over and over but something always kept it from happening then finally calmed enough to let life happene
“The floor, is lava” got me
Such a great video of Earth’s history. Kurzgesagt is the best!
The human shame in history just like the aboriginal massacre in many places until it will be a turning point, and I am watching this now, a documentary made like a time line of 4 billions year of life, slow transformation over 4 billion years, so events, human events are extremely negligible on the scale, intelligent or dumb, it doesn't matter really what we do to each other, we will face our end, evolution showed that if we don't reach diversity in all level we will vanish, fighting diversity lead to extermination
@kurzgesagt I love your channel and I use this video currently to study for my finals. However, I really enjoy the music when the carboniferous timezone comes around but its not listed under Epic Mountains spotify. Would there by chance be a resource to access that video? I just love the chorus etched into it. Thanks
I never comment but this was such a BEAUTIFUL video! The colors, the music.. transitions.. voice.. it’s a masterpiece! Bravo!
This is pretty cool.
This is so sick, cool job to the whole team:)
Personally I would have preferred more information and facts throughout. Currently watching the Hadean section. Things you could have said: - explain why the Earth remains so hot and lava covered despite cooling into space. - How much heat is being radiated away, where did it come from, what is the contribution from radioactive materials? - what is the frequency of meteors, how big were they and what were they made from? How much larger is Earth getting throughout this time? - How fast is the moon leaving us, why is it leaving us? - how fast is the moon growing, is it taking most of the impacts and shielding us? - The moon was shown to instantly be tidally locked, how long did this process actually take?
one of the best things i have ever seen  gives me goosebumps
It's crazy how there was life pretty much as soon as the first raindrops fell, but it still took this long for complex multicellular life to evolve
"Don't blink or you might miss all of Hman history."
Music if fire tho
those are some terraria vibe music
I really hope this serves to educate and humble at least a few young earth creationists.
the music has an epic progression. this is an instant classic.
Would be helpful to explain why snowball earth happened and why it ended.
I listened to this whilst starting my website :)
Sbhan allha
This was dragged out and not very entertaining
This is the kind of stuff teachers need in the classroom
This is so cool and it actually gradually changes instead of some lazy jump cuts! berry good vidja
After watching this and “the history of the world I guess” I think I can say I am an expert on… well, everything
we get this for free and surviving barstool wants 10 dollars for their episodes “eye roll”
Nice track. Watched this video while on MDMA. Marvelous!
Bravo
I think that if the dinosaurs didn’t go extinct mammals wouldn’t have been able to come into existence because evolution would’ve taken more of a turn on reptiles so who knows maybe we would’ve been lizard people😅😅😅
Can someone please tell me how much time was spent on this ONE video
Thank you for always putting out such amazing content! My kids request these videos to watch before bedtime! One of biggest influences on their interests in science, history, tech etc
Thanks for putting this out for free... Thank you for all of your work and your extensive contribution to human curiosity and divulgation.
Even earth follows the classic 3 Act model.....just stretched into billions of years thats all😅
bro really explained earth lore, what a beautiful piece
Poor old earth 🌍 has taken a beating 😂and gone through so many changes in temperature                        (cold hot cold hot) Climate change is real and we as people don’t have anything to do with it 💯
I rarely leave comments on videos, and I really don't know what to write except that thing is being incredibly beautiful. I feel really... Um, I dont know how to describe that. Thank you so much for this masterpiece.
he even gave us 3mins 31 seconds more, respect bro
Where can you find the song played in the carboniferous part?
This is your magnum opus
Cool. Bill Wurtz (i think that was the guy) did this in 13 minutes or so. Not that i complain, i appreciate you did this😁
Okay, but can you do a Christian version? I think it would be cool to see 7 days of creation animated. Of course, it’s okay to say no.
How can we be so sure About that hadean éra ?
Simply beautiful
These videos are the reason I try to support this channel by buying merch
I've literally watched this video at least once a day since its been published and every single time my jaw hits the floor as though i didn't know what was coming.  Words cannot express how absolutely mind blowing this video is in every way. Animation, research, music -  this truly is the most innovative and well executed video on this entire platform.      👏
Amazing that we have footage of Earth when it was still a gigantic ball of lava. The cameraman is really everywhere.
i'm so happy i watched this <3
bro just thank you
unintentional asmr
Beyond a masterpiece.
I thought it was 8 billion years old
Can you upload a version with just the music, so we can listen to it as an ambient sleep track?
Wowsome 👍👍
this is history of the entire world, I guess
Having watched only 14 minutes so far, I just wanted to point out I am a bit disappointed there is no mention of the composition of the atmosphere in the early stages or where the water "that rains to form the oceans" comes from. For all of the detail that could potentially go into these questions, the video definitely simplifies them excessively, to the point of being better suited for children.
Well how do you know this?
4.5 billion in dog years
I bought a app i haven't even used yet because yall deserves that easy 3 dollars for how much yall put into making compex concepts digestible to masses , thank you   I feel alot of people gonna light one up a reshape perspective of life existence and what it means to be human on a rock hardening through space  , my hope is this inspires various forms of art ,
In my animation experience. The transitions probably took the most work. Absolute brilliant work.
Thank you for your very important work. It helps a lot to understand our Planet und our history. ❤
This is beautiful, my new favorite thing
Lol I'm the smartest in my whole family of 8 people even though I'm the youngest because I watched you videos
This is incredible, imagine this in VR omg
Getting some nice Pink Floyd vibes in the Ryacian......
Loved it. Need one from cambrian to current era or the last 100mil years in an hour, those would be awesome
Really enjoy this video. Its on my favourites saved now. Thank you very much! Could we get one from like 100,000 bc to the year 3000 ?
Um, you might not have read the bible or something, but it didn't happen *anything* like this.
not gonna lie kauatkaradr has one of the best chilling miusic ❤
Beautiful!❤
Sooooo good! WOW!
For anyone who didn’t watch to the very end he says they worked on it on and off since 2019 so yes years
And to think my 20 years has felt long
This video really helps me fall asleep❤❤❤thanks
Just incredible
Jesus loves you & made a way for our sins to be forgiven, turn to Christ & repent for eternity in Heaven!!!
i dropped my keys into the time portal and they went to earth somewhere, sometime can someone help me find them
Hello I really love this Channel and want to Support it so I have been trying to buy one of your Posters. Sadly there seems to be some issue with the shop/Website since it's not loading properly :( Hope it'll work soon! Have a nice week and thanks for the hard work ❤
Watching an hour long video, for mammals having less then a minute and humans being a blip. It really puts things into perspective.
45:03
Orosirian is Risk of rain style art and music! love it
it took me 1 billion years to watch 14mins of this video already
The music on this is incredible focus music... You always have good music, but wow I very much need to go get this.
sending this to angry religious people
This is lofi with commentary
29:38 I thought Methane + Oxygen -> Water + CO2 is exothermic. Why does this cool Earth down?
bruhh they are focking legends
holly shiit little birds are insane wow
How sick is that Stenain Jam though...
Wow, this was an amazing work! I don't know how u guys made it happen, but really amazing job! Fact tag it was free, ur hardwork of so many years is more than appreciable! Hope you guys receive as much respect as possible
Humbling...
44:59 whoa, sex.
I thought the moon was rotating on it's early days before it got locked. Am I right?
Thank you so much for the efforts! Respect+
❤❤❤
I just love this channel
Watching 24:27
hahahaha how did you know its 4.5b  old. you were there?
45:05 Yes. A very big improvement indeed..          📸
Sorry but bill wurtz explained 13.7 billion years in 18 minutes
Je veux tellement cette vidéo en français
Okay. But, why? Seems like we (humans) will always in the end get back to this question. Why all this? How could all of this happen and exists?
Now do an hour long video from the start of humanity up to the present.
Urrmmmm , Why and how did the water come about ?! (Maybe i wasn’t paying attention)
3AM videos
I appreciate the effort on the animation it was IMMERSIVE but for the info on this video most of it ain't real
I'm here for the progressive house set
i really wish that may humans evolve so much they could become galactic beings.
*SKIPS all the parts that politically do not align with channel (Like how money was created and regulated for being starter, you know the thing you are enslaved to)
they really chose the HARDEST soundtrack for this one
One second is a million years. 1000000 years!!
Nice animation, but it lacks lots of informations to the depicted timeframes. The timescales couldve included subnames of Eras and Periods. Also informations about current earth temperature, oxygen level, biosphere, major events.
Well, at least they had good music back in the Hadean.
make more of there please!
amazing really enjoyed this!
this is a masterpeace
There could be now a 1h video about the evolution of civilization, or even humanity
Put this in the tv in the background while you’re high, it’s a crazy vibe
Sound track is bad ass
31:30 bro that song is a whole ass vibe
It is amazing to think that the Jurassic period begins at 58:02.
can we have this for wallpaper engine? <3
finally found my go to sleep vid, I slept like a baby during the 20 mins in 😍 gonna watch this when i have hard time sleeping cuz the length is perfect and i like that it’s actually making me learn smth
Perfect video to put in at 3 am and pray I can go finally go to sleep
39:53 the bro spits into the mic "One of the most important moments of life - pff" 🤣
Can’t wait to watch this on some sort of psychedelics. These videos are the best  for tripping!
The history of the entire word i guess
Yes please explain how you know all this. Brother, you were not there😂 the earth is not that old. It’s actually around 4,000-5,000 years old. Please stop pumping your viewers with no fact based knowledge. Literally none of this video is actually fact💀💀💀
Thank you for making this video and letting us watch for free. The animation team did an amazing job animating this along with the narrator and everyone else. We would love to watch more videos as such in future. :D
1 second should be 10 million years or 5 million, it went too slow showing the same thing
Extremely good video!
I’m sorry but scientists say that the Earth much more older than 4.5 billions years 😢 so not true information
love this video. classic kurzgesagt art, animation, narration and badass music.
How rare and beautiful it is to even exist.....
Shout out to the animators who had to sit down and animate for 4.5 billion years just so we could watch this video 🛐🛐🛐
Crap
45:04 Kurzgesagt say sex
>"then into dinosaurs" >zooms in on a pterosaur
That baseline during the Mesoarchean period was top notch!  Edit: tonian is also amazing! Almost sounds like it was inspired by TOOL.
I just reached the mesoarchean period, and the music is amazing. This is great.
I will never get over how insanely well done these animations are and how long they must’ve taken to make. I absolutely love this channel. Keep up the good work. 😊
Earth must’ve told him this
Wow, just wow. That was amazing
This is my favorite video ever. Thank you. Absolutely perfect. The sound track, the animation, the editing, the narration - this is a masterpiece and please if you'd like to make another like it, I think the whole K crew would slay it again.
2:00
The humans dont even know what happened before 2000 years for sure. 🤦🏻
Thoroughly enjoyed this, thank you! Think I will come back to it/use it as background for some stuffs! <3
Feels like a meditation to me. Just watch the world forming so fast... Peace ✨
Excellent masterpiece! I can't seem to find the last part of the soundtrack. The music that plays from the Cretaceous specifically. 58:46
I got confused because the top right says millions instead of billions. I love that you made this, this channel always delivers.
❤
Beautiful video ❤️❤❤
Notice how everything is "maybe, possibly, might" basically everything is a theory nothing is properly approved even to the carbon dating. The Universe clearly shows that a Creator exists and thats God. Genesis explains everything not with "maybe, possibly, might"
Cool vid thx guys 😎
Definitely did not work for studying as I spent more time watching and listening to the video. 👍🏻
Just think if no mass extinctions happened therrs a chance we might have had more than one intelligent life form on earth
personally I disagree
umg the camera never curves so that is evidence the eart is flat !!1 /s
You are insane 😮😮😮😮
Really would like a BTS of this!
Took me 3025 million years to come here!
"life find's a way" i caught that Jurassic park quote.
Hole up... Only 20 likes on the video??
But it's not, man. It's not 4.5 billion years old, cutie pies.
Wait, so we weren't created by an already existing all-powerful life form?
This video is amazing!
Just saw a post on Reddit of someone bitchin about the videos not being long enough. Welp, they can shut up now. lol
A whole hour of beautiful kurzgesagt animation, and we also get an hour of absolute instrumental bangers with time changes and sick bass lines / synth & drum work.  I also love "big boy eukaryotes" lol
They didn't need to give us absolute art in the form of amazing backround film and traight up bangers of music, but they still did
Wow, amazing props to you guys!
I enjoyed the music. Please release an album
Who here watched until the end? v
The sound, music, and visual of the Hadean is definitely the most satisfying for me. I wonder at how quiet the Paleoarchean must have been on land.
how the human era is defined?  12000 years seems short since there are homo sapiens much longer than that
Play at x2 for about 3 millions years to pass each second
What's the point of history when we never learn from it?
I won 3 Fortnite solo games back to back to back with this on the dual monitor. Thanks for the dubs!
Maybe there are thousands of planets with highly intelligent life on it, we just started searching 900 million years to early 😮
You guys and Roanoke Gaming are a treat.
Kurzgesagt videos will be relevant for many upcoming decades or even centuries.  YouTube should feel blessed that it has a channel like Kurzgesagt.
Fuq... I felt asleep for 2 billion years
pls make more long videos like this, luv it so much, it really helped with school, very informative, and interesting, the animation and visuals are so satisfying <3
I wish I could get this as a desktop background but slow it down to 1 minute per 1.5 million years.
wow. unbelievable
The earth was created my the father we called god
Is it weird that the first video I saw on this channel was the one about obliterating the Amazon rainforest with nuclear weapons, and then ending the planet?
The internet today is so full of trash, hate, fake news and other nonsense. You are a beacon of light and reason in this chaos. Thank you for your effort. Wish I could be part of it. Keep up the good work! ❤
One of the most, if not the most educational video out there.
Music is insane
its all made up science, all speculation…. dont believe this! believe the BIBLE!!!!
Imagine if this video was use for class, it would be amazing
Christians be like: Bro you forgot GOD gotdammit !!!!
55:40 MY BOY DUNKLEOSTEUS!!! I WAS EXCITED FOR THE NAUTILOIDS BUT I WAS WAITING HOPIGN FOR DUNKLEOSTEUS TO APPEAR AND I'M SO HAPPY IT MADE IT IN!!! THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO DREW IT IT'S BEAUTIFUL
This vid hits different on weed bro
Can you please upload a version without music just with the voice and sound effects
I hope history teachers show this Vid in lessons
And here we are living in a time where the mammals think they can fight climate change. How cute.
The history of the entire world ig
Another absolutely stunning video. Great music. Thank you!
Watching this felt like visiting a festival 😍
what? 11 likes? Am I seeing it right ?
gosh i love this channel sm, thank you!
Songs there are so wonderfull that I am listening to these when I am working 👍 Thank you for that!
What was the music that started in the Cretaceous Period through the end of the video? So good.
Werry streached
4.5 billion years is just assumption. Crazy how they push a secular story and everyone is okay with that.
This video took 4 years to make👏👏👏👏👏
After watching this, War for "Holy" land is even more stupid than it already is.
3:59 i definitely like the music
Art director: "We need to make sure people know this is german production." Sound designer: "Techno." <3
If they worked on this (on and off) since 2019, then imagine what else they are working on
i love you so much
respect to camera man who traveled 4.5 billion years for this vidio
I think it's still insane how an entire MILLION years is passing every second, like we can understand what that means, the passage of time and all, but a million years is just so unimaginably long that it's almost incomprehensible, just imagining seeing nothing but lava and blinding light for your entire lifetime and the lifetimes of millions of ancestors after you, it's just overwhelming!
Christians be like: where’s the snake?
free is insane
Really appreciate you guys so much knowledge for free ❤❤
This is insane animation..😮😮😮😳😳😳😳
Why does this look so real
Why did the ice unfreeze randomly in the cryogenian? Just an animation loop miss?
Where to download these amazing soundtracks?
Flat Eathers and Creationists are disliking your video 😜
This is a gorgeous video! I'll be coming back to it again :)
now i can tell my friends i’ve witnessed 4.5 billion years of the earths surface
Incredible video
Major roku screensaver vibes
The bgm feela like something out of terraria
The music was amazing throughout, but the Hadean was a true banger
지구 입장에서 인간이란 종이 사라진 다는 것은 아주 사소한 일일뿐이네
Shoutout to the Bangiomorpha Pubescens.
The background music is awesome
Thank you for this ❤❤❤
But I wanted to know how water created it self from lava...
I love all your guys videos science rules🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
Love it! I hope you make similar 1h videos for the solar system, galaxy, and universe. Then we'd have a playlist!
Beautiful video. Not a lot of videos can keep me interested for  much more the 10-15 minutes, but at sat through this entire thing. A true masterpiece!
Thanks for existing, is all that I could say🖤
Einfach herrlich was ihr hier macht ❤ danke und wie ich was gefühlt habe!!
Is there a VR version of this?
I have watched the video from beginning to end, and I have to say that I've never felt so real the "we are just a breath in the history of Earth"...  Amazing work !! 🔥✨️
Damn, I blinked.
This has now become like my science Pomodoro technique! Thank you
I'm not surprised ... its made in Germany
Unreal! Just watching it! You guys are insane! I love how much i learn from your videos! Some of them i can even show some of my friends who dont speak english because u make them in german! And now i got goosebumbs from the drop about 3358 mio years ago ❤ kurzgesagt your just amazing! Thank you!
I think Kurzgesagt can make a full-length video about paint drying and they still would end up with a banger.
Дякую, дуже цікаво.
So amazing I always wanted to see how the Earth was created. worth every second of my time😊❤❤❤
This would be cool as a book too! I LOVE this!
pretty amazing
If anyone hasn’t mentioned it already, this would be an awesome screen saver.
This video proves that god does not exist
a good movie! thank you!
Probably the greatest video on YouTube. Love you Kurz❤
Cool
Loved this video. my only criticism is that I really wish there was more explanation. “Largest verifiable meteor impact”— okay, where is this impact feature? Did it lead to any extinction events or climate events? “Cambrian explosion and subsequent extinction event”—how did this extinction event occur? How bad was it? The video would be improved by a lot if there was just a little more explanation. The things explained only seem to bring up more questions that go unanswered.
Really ambitious idea. I loved it❤
Yeah I'm wiggling my toesies woesies! You can't staph me!!
wow just wow. it sounds like life is pretty fresh in the big picture of things. that could give way to the theory's that we might be the first life in space to make it this far. i hope the JWST finds a satellite orbiting a planet some day
Do one like this but based on human history. Watched the whole video. :P
I must say, that this probably the finest documentary about the history of our planet that I’ve ever seen. Over the years, I’ve seen countless documentaries and videos about the history of earth, but never have I seen it so succinctly shown in such an understandable manner. This is definitely one of the greatest YouTube videos of this decade, and I would absolutely love to see more. Thank you to our little bird friends at Kurzgesagt.
Daaaaamn! This soundtrack kicks hard! ❤
👍👍👍
You didn't mention the BIFs (banded iron formations) that resulted from the reaction of the reaction of newly produced oxygen with iron in the water in the Siderian.
amazing Video. EPIC!
Great animation and work. The background music is too much and annoying though. Something a bit softer maybe?
i'm watching this for the second time already
finally finished after one and off watching for 3 weeks
In the beginning GOD created the heavens and earth.
An ambitious project that is well executed.
Genius video thank you
Amazing video❤❤❤
okay it is anoying to gust wach while there is no talking
Good Stuff
the music is soo good
omg 1 hour how did you make it this i sooo crazy [this is my first time writeing a comment
Any claim made about an occurrence that happened 4.5 billion years ago is pure speculation and wholly unscientific. No hypothesis formed is testable as we dont have access to that long ago.
Just wow.. it really put things into perspective. Loved that line "Earth is ancient, we are new". Yet somehow we managed to ruin the earth so much that i don't see it suitable for life in next 200-300 years... So much pain endured by mother earth since eons for us to destroy in mere few thousand years!!
Although this is the first video I'm watching  I got really addicted to  the artwork, concepts, videos. Etc. Honestly, deserves a new subscriber👍
Whoever made the soundtrack for this is the real MVP  I'm ravin' to this tonight
Omg... Imagine the amount of cell splits since the first one on earth! Thats pointing infinite monkey like.
Living on planet Earth is so sexy!
Just wow, I had mental orgasm just by the thought of the whole hour of your brilliant production
For some reason I thought this video was about terraria
This is a work of art!!! Amazing congratulations
Bro basically made a movie
Dude, we’re only witnessing all of creation, the music doesn’t need to go this hard.
10 seconds in and I’m already fascinated with this video
Well I keep on falling asleeep did anyone see Jesus real father?
Uh I thought some white guy did all this.
Insane how humanity doesn't even exist for 1 Second of this Video yet
i can appreciate this the same sober, and unfortunately while smoking the badies (don't tell my parents kurzgesast!)
Probably the most transcendent video I’ve experienced on YouTube so far
Great soundtrack. Never thought I'd be jamming to the Mesoarchaen period.
The earth is less than 10000 years old, you’re delusional.
Impressive work,a very calming video,and the music was beautiful❤
The music during Paleogene.. I neeed that.
This is sick. I love the appreciation everyone is giving it too!
I hope we last as many "geological seconds" as the ending of this video.
❤
my cat and I enjoyed watching this together :D
it would be nice if you could reupload this exact same video without the extreme EDM beats and instead make it a relaxing zen journey through time  just a thought
Study with it - keep it in the background... Or get high as a kite, and watch the planet - GO! (in slow mo!)
Happy birthday Kurzgesagt !!! I know I'm a bit late : but what are a few months on the span of 4.5 Billions years. <3
It's just not an absolute truth that the moon was created that way..its an accepted theory
beautiful art style
I love this... Its like therapy to me
<33333
I skipped to a random point and it the first thing I hear is they invented sex
What happened at 29:42?
Earth lore summerrized😭💯💯🙏🙏
I got tears in my eyes, seeing the live evolve and how beautiful it actually is.
Pro tip. Watch this being high as fukc
we don't know anything
i agree with the human history part we have not evolved from the "hit rock - kill" psychology
this type of information beam has so much potential. I really enjoyed this timeline but at the same time I hope you will revisit this and improve on this concept, because it has so much potential! when more events which are described are displayed for the sake of the timeframe, yet still most of the time the development is static, you get both action science and artistically induced intellectual contemplation, how exquisite combination this is! many thanks for what you do here.
insane how a lighting lasts for half a million years
man i should get really high and come back to this   edit: wooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
This was really cool <3 I watched the whole thing. It's really awesome to see the entire history of our planet and to have it put into perspective how relatively short our time here is compared to it. The first quarter or so also really reminded me of the Bit.Trip games, particularly the music.
Another Fortnite event,Good!😂
Truly an amazingly entertaining and educating video
@kurzgesagt Could you please upload a version of this with the commentary as subtitle only? I would like to let your video run as background music + video during an privat event. But having the narrator cut in while people are talking wouldn't be great.
amazing video. Much love
Yeah no this is my background audio when i study biology now😂❤ thanks for making this!
babe, babe, new kurzgesagt movie just dropped, lets go
What a beautiful and captivating video. I consider myself a rather occasional enthusiast of palaeontology, I know even less of what was before the Devonian period  Watched this video through to the end, inspired to learn more, thank you!
what the...
I’m happy to be a small blip in the wonderous history of our world.
It took them 4 years
Great video. This is why I'm subscribed to this channel.
this is my jam for when i m coding :D
Complex life didnt just gappen , needs a creator , God is Real.
God created life. This is real and true.
sell us the soundtrack pls
I'm probably having too much fun lol 10:00 onwards the lightnings are in sync with the music
33:35 That Rhyacian Orosirian transition is awesome ! Love it ! Name of the song : Ur my crush. And Thanks Kurzgesagt and Epic Mountain !
random glitch at 29:43 ?
we need video of each mass extinctions 😮
I’m waiting for Adam and Eve.
What did we do to deserve such a incredible video?
"Don't blink, or you might miss all of human history." That line feels so powerful, it really puts things into perspective.
Thank you for making this video. The time and effort it must've took is nothing but extraordinary. Animation and narration is great and music is perfect 🙌
Did i accidentally get premium or have kurzgesagt and yt been generous enough to make an exception for this vid
This is amazing !! I love this !
Hahahaha he said earth was a hell of lava 4.5 billion years ago. Uh ohhhhh, we’re using biblical terms in a scientific video. If hell doesn’t exist then our big hell of lava doesn’t either. No no, you can’t use the terminology of something you don’t believe in to describe something you do.
突然引我深思
Since 1,250,000 years pass each second in this video, it would be so awesome if a sequel to this video would portray the past roughly 1,250,000 years in one hour, with about 350 years passing each second!
Es increíble la cantidad de personas que trabajan en este canal, muchas felicidades, continúen así y gracias por el contenido educativo gratis (para los que contribuimos solamente con ver y compartir).
Lovedd ittr
Best chair dance party I've had in a while.
My attension span is repaired and my day is better.
Beautiful
we can go back 4.5 billion years and explain detailed step by step how we came to live. but yet we can't figure out how the pyramids are build? yeah seems about right
22:33 could easily fit into a doom soundtrack
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE JEWEL!!!! Without a doubt, this is one of the best videos on YouTube. Insane.
Mesoarchean heavy prog techno ftw! All they fear is birb.
i wonder what the rain was like during the eoarchean era. was it akin to the rain from a severe thunderstorm or was it even worse than all accounts of rain recorded by humanity?
This just became my new favorite video on YouTube.
I'm still waiting for Adam and Eve
❤
One hour?! That's too long, bro. My tiktok, Snapchat brain can't handle this shite.
i knew it would go this way, but still, the build up at the end had me in awe. thank you kurzgesagt
Bravo it was Amazing !
I have the impression that evolution is approaching the speed of light and then time will stop
WHy is the music, animation so good and how do yall get it so factually correct it is so mind boggling. PLUS the fricking music matches all the themes of the eras so well
Nobody going to mention how old the cameraman must be by now?
I thought it was recently proven that earth had two moons after the collision that assimilated in orbit?
thank you
44:53 I should not have laughed this hard at "the algae bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex."
everyone is praising the animation in this video - and rightly so!! - but i also want to give praise to the audio/sound engineering!! the music and FX were great!!
Wow amazing video!!!
This is what the snail trying to cross the street sees
You guys are beyond perfection
what songes are these i need to learn more about rock fusion and how to make music like risk of rain
Need the song release for this lol shit goes hard 🔥🔥
Very cool thank you 🙏
Animating the whole geologic time scale is no easy task... just God damn the effort to make this...
Fantastic masterpiece! The music is simply top tier! *chef's kiss*
it's crazy that scientists will cook up all this bullshit just so they don't need to accept God as the creator of the universe
i blinked and missed mankind’s history 😭
This is gonna be what I fall asleep to each night
LOVE THIS. I have adhd and I NEED chill stuff in the background to get any work done. So sick love this kurzgesagt!
I needed it this so much thank you ❤
now do 13.8 billion years in 3 hours
Just thank you ❤ 4 years of work for us to enjoy. I originally planned to put it on while working but I ended up admiring the view and music for the whole hour.
I was delighted to hear Dino Discovery towards the end. Wonderful video, thank you so much for making it! =(^-^)=
It's saying something when at a million years a second I still watched the video at 1.5x speed because it was too long.😮
Brings me a lot of nostalgia...
Can we get a 10 hour with music only this sound track is a bop❤
❤
This deserves an Oscar
Glitch at 29:43
Watch while reading comment 👇
Can I make this desktop wallpaper?
The Is Now Know 4.5 Billion Years Old From Earth
nice
Absolute perfection! What a mesmerizing masterpiece!
50:30 Big Boy Eukaryotes in house babyyyyyyy
Bravo
Omg thanks a lot. İt was quite a voyage 🌻
The music in this is amazing!! a lot of it sounds very Tool inspired
Nah God made the world
watching the moon slowly harden is nuts
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😊😊😊😮😮😮
Why does it begin to rain in the second period
Omg bro im 2 mins in and this is pretty boring
Was this animated with Microsoft Paint 😳😳. Kinda rough looking
Ahh, this is enjoyable content. Nicely done. May just have to overlay some lofi onto it tho
the soundtrack eatssss😩
This edm track SLAPS omg
“The floor is lava” !!
Very impressive work!
I washed my giant pile of dishes, this helped a lot. Bagger music
this is perspective shifting
I’M SO SORRY 59:49 IS SENDING ME. i adore this video and its concepts as a huge science nerd and this is blowing my mind but I’m PISSING MYSELF LAUGHING. narrator i love you
Whatched it 3x times. Thank you guys for your work!
Did @arminvanbuuren made the trancey soundtrack? Its so epic
THE FLOOR IS LAVA???
Amazing
At 58:13 life uh… finds a way.
Bill wurtz but hes serious and German
The music is great!
Despite the "boring billion" I was riveted the whole time.
I loved this so much
1 hour of super annoying music.. for me this messed up the whole video.
God's Amazon shipping process takes forever. lol
Thank you so much for this! I've been watching/listening to it on repeat while working. I was struck by how short human history is compared to the geological timeline.
All of this so we can pay taxes lmaooo
The mesoarchean music goes HARD AF!!!!
the sound track it thins video is amazing!!
this is actually strangely the first video in a while that i very much enjoy listening/watching to, never been so happy with Kurzgesagt support of big CORPs but this is a pleasant ride, nice job guys!
Hell yeah, someone put Djent in the soundtrack!
All of earths history a second time before gta 6 💀
It's fake, the oldest evidence is that the Earth is 6000+- years old. The method that was used to measure how old things are is invalid.
va pup coaie
This only has 5.9M views!?!? This video should have more like 590 M views
where did the water that rained in EOARCHEAN come from?
Portuguese?
This is one of the best videos in all Youtube. I love this so much!
Thanks so much for the journey. Nice music, facts and animation. I really enjoyed that, thank you, again!
The music is really well done in this. I love how effective this is for education, I never had an interest in geological history, but you pulled this off in style and surpassed the interest barrier for me that no educational material in this topic has been able to before.
‘And the floor is Lava’  Excerpt from Kurzgesagt, Yt 1:20 verse; Earth’s history.
they say god made the earth in 7 days but heres the proof that he took billions of years
it really puts into perspective how long it took what we know of common multicellular life to come into existence and how many times the slate has been wiped clean and redone since then.... we really are just a blip in the cosmic timeline
I have a question. In Eoarchean period, did it rain unstoppably, or were there breaks for hours/days/months?
Mother Earth gave birth to life
Creating this animation probably consumed years, and the fact that we obtained it without cost is mind-boggling.... Learn a lots of....🧡 Thank You Brother🤩
I found it very very boring
51:23 whoa... how indeed...?
To everyone at Kurszgesagt;  The Animators, voice actors, sound engineers, writers, researchers and more i can't think of, thanks for all the content you're pouring out to us for free, it means a lot for many of us to be able to have this kind of content to relax to, learn and enjoy.  you're the golden egg of Youtube <3
Im listening to this while working on schoolwork and then just randomly greeted with the invention of sex 💀💀💀
Subnautica vibes with the music and underwater scenes <3
Perfect info!
what is it called when you can just stare at a white wall (in this case, this one-hour video nontstop with cool music) without doing nothing, and you just enjoy it nevertheless? because that's what it feels like watching this
This isn't what I expected, but awesome video nonetheless. That ending was so exciting, I almost shed a tear.
God this is a bless 😭
a masterpiece video, and wonderful music, Congratulations, I am using it a lot to relax
how did life "form" tho? it just seems too easy
Best channel on this platform.
And you still want to say that earth is flat and the evolution is just a fictional story that some fantasy author wrote and all the world governments are making us believe?....btw amazing trip man epic video.
I wonder how many, if any, supernovas would have lit up in the sky over this time period?
If this was combined with the stage productions of the War of the Worlds and the Lion King it might make the greatest rock opera musical of all time.
A
Yes Now I can believe that only colours can teach you …can make us imagine the things and thus makes us to create and evolve our knowledge 😊😊😊😊😊
Why don't hicks clean their showers? Because the bacteria was here first, if you don't like it leave.
Even Earth had a montage 🎶
Please have the musicians perform this live on stage with the animation in the background. I will gladly pay to see that show!!! Truly enlightened animation and music, I feel deeply inspired. Thanks!
I watched your whole video without skipping and I bought an poster, I love it!
Amazing, just bravo, and thank you
give us the soundtrack please!
Def only like a couple thousands years but ok
Oh my goodness. The Cambrian explosion only appeared in the last 10 minutes! I think this is the best explanation I've ever seen of just how long geological timescales are.
❤
How did it rain for millions of years, filling the ocean? How is the rain being created and why? Could of put so much more information in this.
The chicxulub asteroid really put it all in perspective for me. That was profound.
this is the most relaxing, most educating & most enjoyable thing I have ever seen and I have seen a lot the picture the music the voice and the very subject and structure of if it is Masterpiece!
I give likes for videos like every five years or so, very rarely. This one got a like from me.
Evolution is a silly religion.
Bro really said “History of the entire world, I suppose”
At 19:40 I thought they were transitioning to DOOM music for a moment lol
Theist or not.. I think this video is a must watch.
I am just here for the music lol (Tonian reminds me of Tool)
4.5 billion… nice one science 😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
48:14
this was insane to watch
PLEAAAAASEEEE BRIING IT ON SPANISH
Thank youuuy
Video was great until 1:00:20 but that section is unexcusable. Thumbs down
Who did the music?
Impossible not to love
Do x2 for trippy Dance experience
I hate the fucking ping pong ball bouncing sound in the music
This is the best video to watch on high dose keta 🦄
sound effects is good
you make things so much cooler than how it really looks like
Thanks so much! I love this so much
Best video on YouTube
Entrancing, fascinating, and frankly... By the end quite moving. I feel so insignificant.
Much hot and comfy
As a molecule from the beginning of time I can confirm this is infact what happened
But still, where did all the water appear from?
there are 4 kinds of kurzgesagt videos: world problem what if we did something funny information on an interesting thing art
it could be in 5 min
I really hope when we got to the Cambrian Period, I'm not the only one who sang, "It's the Cambrian Explosion!"
Thank you for everything 🥹
I finally feel like I can kinda grasp how insane our geological timescale truly is. This video is exceptional✨ I'll be rewatching for sure
The fact that all these ppl believe this crap is insane. Please read the Bible.
This video is absolutely incredible!! And then to think this dumb homo sapiens species is destroying this awesome planet in record time.. We should be very, very ashamed of our species!!
This was insane
{Do those who disbelieve ever consider that the heavens and the earth(the universe )were at first one piece, and then We parted them as separate entities; and that We have made every living thing from water? Will they still not come to believe?}  — Quran 21:30 {أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا ۖ وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ ۖ أَفَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ }[الأنبياء : 30]

Thank you 🧡💛🧡
Really puts ECDs into perspective.
Just incredible
one hour of animation is unimaginable, and they made one hour of music for this video too, that's pure dedication there
Brilliant!
I'm high watching this, I think I've unlocked something in my mind
I wonder if this would ever be available without the voiceover? I love the animations and the music, and it would be perfect for studying or working but talking distracts me easily. Thank you, Kurzgesagt!
Bro really dug deep for these earth files from past updates
music makes this great bg video :) :) :)
I have watched it four times now. It will not be the last time.
Wish that asteroid would've never killed the dinosaurs.
Crazy how that all happened in 6 days
fascinating and depressing at the same time. it's funny how much of a 'nothing' we are.
I want the soundtrack of this as a vinyl
imagine how boring it would be if you were immortal and if earth would reset and you would have to wait 4,5 billion years to finally again talk to somebody
This was great ❤
Top tier ❤
Thank you a lot! I watched it on my birthday and it was a great present!
you guys rock out these videos and you learn so much! Please keep doing what your doing! been a fan since you guys started and I had my first google account
I blinked at the end and missed us all.
The music is soo great, thank you for publishing it to Spotify and other platforms <3
Who tf dislikes this?
Not historically accurate. look at the Bible
This is amazing! What is the song called for the last 10min? Awe inspiring!
There are some really cool progressive rock drum rhythms on this thing. Love it!
wtf the music is awesome 19:58 slaps!
I love you guys so much please never stop doing videos.
I recently bought my first house and played all your videos while  I painted the rooms and did some minor repair  over the course of two months before fully moving in.  Your videos are the best and are now forever part of my memory of my new home. I was born and raised in Hawaii but moved away.  This video is so fitting for me to finally have made a comment with a Hawaiian name given to the super cluster.  Thank you.
As an avid YouTube consumer, this may just be the single most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed on this entire platform.
Please make a video like this for the history of the universe-- 13 billion years in one hour
I'm here for the music
1:00:44 God wakes up
This is an incredible video and you can tell it's been a labour of love. Genuinely gets across a true sense of scale. Especially with the evolution of humans being a blink and you miss it moment. Very well done.
Thank you honestly I will share this for eons
If I was a teacher I’d 100% play this in class
music on cryogenian sounds like terraria
An instant high classic
Getting caught up on the backstory. Is this a good starting point?
Uhhh where Adam and Eve
Truly Amazing video, it’s unreal that we can get content like this
i want to watch this on acid
ALMOST perfect video, and thank you for making it! (Perfect would be the birds in the credits dancing to the beats)
"Earth is Ancient, We are NEW" facts.....
The DJ for this needs a raise
| BUT THERE IS NO GOD |
The music on this video is just as insanely well made as the animation itself (and it has been on all other past videos) but the section that plays on Cretaceous period is otherworldly magnificent. Using nothing more than a subtle choir with carefully composed classic instrument and ambiance sounds, it communicates this happy, warm, and grateful feeling; all while being calm and collected to ultimately make you feel proud of the physics and probability miracle the temporary arrangement of atoms that goes around by your name, is. Brilliant!
Very amazing!
I do not care how much work you put into this if yall think we evolved from ugly ahh monkeys and the big bang occured well..GET A FUCKING LIFE Jesus created us not some explosion in the space
Phenomenal! When the dinosaurs died out I got goosebumps.
Amazing the amount of dedication put into these videos and animation is perfect🫡
the animation, sound design, and music is so amazing at the beginning of the Rhyacian segment the sound design and visuals made me feel cold. I love every kurzgesagt video
I know I watched this like 27 times but everything about this is amazing and I’m not afraid to double that time
Fantastic. Thank you 😀
Not gonna lie, that wasn’t as easy to watch as most of your content😅 But I appreciate you striving to create scientifically accurate material for your audience. Stay inspirational, Kurzgezagt
“Hey Kurzgesagt Music Producer, we want you to write a concept album.”  “Ok, what about?”  “EVERYTHING.”
So damn sad... Wish there Was a Option to Show this Video to my wife, my younger children and my mom, but they just understand german... Would be sooo nice if kurzgesagt would have a german channel where they upload Videos like this....
Has anyone already complained about the title?  This is almost entirely not HISTORY, right? History is the study of past through historical sources, which are artifacts and documents of different kinds. This is ALL OF PREHISTORY + a few seconds of implied history time that are not even mentioned.  I guess I'm just challenging you to make an ALL OF ACTUAL HISTORY video, because I can't have enough of Kurzgesagt and I am relying on your generosity.  So let me rephrase this: THANK YOU, YOU ARE AMAZING PEOPLE, AND PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE ABOUT real HISTORY!!! <3 <3 <3
keeping techno alive!!!!! through the time that remains atleast. please never sstop the etechno going along with the rest
I love the video all around, but I found some things while watching it. During early/midway in the Neoarchean age, about a second before the cell really close to the screen passes during the loop some of the cells to the right disappear. At 29:44, (for me at least) the bottom quarter of the screen glitches but I can't tell if it does that for everyone. At 42:07 the sun teleports (this one was probably intentional).
4.5 billion years to 1 hour? Impressive but @bill wurtz did it in 20 minutes but still impressive
Interesting theory.
This was truly impressive and inspiring. What an outstanding work!!!!
❤ you practically taught me everything I know
10 minutes in, you earned a thumb up. cant say why really, i just got it by then i guess.
55:48 "the first vertebrate" why it sounds AI ? sounds like it bugged out
holy shit
Tool makes the coolest music videos
Oh yeah? Well Bill Wurtz gave us 13.8 billion years in 30 minutes.
I love this video so much, thanks for that.  I just wish it could have some temperature indicator, just watched a scene where I went "oh I could chill in there" and then remembered it probably was 80 degrees celsius
Will this Video come on the german channel too?
I rolled a blunt and a million years passed away. Snoopy dobby doo❤
best video for having sleep problem
ayyy cool video
i have to say IT IS AMAZING !!! BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO !!! every sec of this video it is master peace !!!
magnificent work!!! you are the best guys thank you from the bottom of my heart!!
Hey! Amazing job, can you mention your sourses in the description if someone (like me) is interested to learn more❤
I blinked 😂😂😂
KINDA SLEEPY
3:55 no mans sky music?!?!?
Love from India thnx for this animated video we r really grateful to u❤❤
Truely Amazing 😮 Thank you ❤
I put this on when I want to go to sleep. It gives me incredible space dreams. Thanks Kurzgesagt. Been a fan since the beginning. This is your great feat yet <3
Amazing vieo, as always, buuuuut :D I have to point out the glitch at 29:43. Thanks for leaving that in, makes it somehow lest perfectinositcally nice :D
idk, my friend said it all really started like, 20 years ago and history is a hoax
This is absolutely fantastic. It's the kind of thing people have to pay for!!! No clue how you guys pulled this off but I am incredibly impressed and thankful.
Sooo, basically the Horseshoe crab is here since the first animal species appeared. That mf is definitely cheating.
I'd love a version of this without the voice over (i do love the voice guy...) - so i can play *more* in the background without it hindering conversation.
We not about to skip past this fire 🔥 soundtrack especially in the Ectasian peroid
Played this while doing my school work, had a wild ride : )
this is the best thing a man could do in the universe
I still prefer the fatboy slim version
Thank you so much @Kurzgesagt 🥰👌
Thank you! Your work is very appreciated!
I love this but the only billions I want is for it to be in my bank account 🏦
4.5 billion years of animating this 1 hr video
Do Mars next! 😜
Some serious @TOOLmusic vibes around 48:00 minutes
1:37 meme
just an absolute banger of a song at around the 17 min mark. what the hell lol.
Broooo the animating is making me cry😢😮❤
could have been a half an hour though!
Your best yet!  Super privileged  to have seen it.   Thank you.
This guy just threw out some random ass number lmao
Joder, si es pu** cine
Sponsored by Bill and Melinda Gates foundation
Epic, now I'm just waiting for those delusional people to say, "earth was made 6000 years ago!!". XD
Your animation and creative team is something else!  I did my best to appreciate everything.  The colors, movements, effects, music... simply amazing!
Well, missed some big things in our history like the anunnaki, Atlantis, etc. but generally, probably fairly accurate. 😜 Really cool stuff here!
At that time scale then the rocky surface of the planet would looks like bubbling soup with mountains risen up and eroded down, canyon being carved up with millions of years of rain, volcanoes risen up and create new landmass, etc.  It'd be pretty much daylight all the time as at that speed then light would seemed persistence on eyes or camera.  Even stars and constellations would changing willy nilly in the sky as we travelling orbitting our milkyway galaxy, bobbing up and down the galactic disc.  Planet surface being holed down pelted by large meteorites and holes being filled with water and grounded down all over again.
This is a soundtrack showcase right?
Reading your book about the cells is just thrilling ! It helps even more when I read it, I imagine your voice in my head which helps me understand
You guys should make a loop of each era's music to study too.
😍
the soundtrack *chef's kiss* 🤌🏼 reminds me of those days where mobile games had similar tracks.
I did feel many, many things. Thank you for all of your effort and passion ❤ Congratulations! 🎉
Thank you, really.
I loved how the moon cooled while it was stepping off screen. I couldn’t stop watching. This must’ve taken some serious man hours. Thank you Kurzgesagt. This was an amazing watch.
How am I just now discovering this channel
This is a metaphor for life. You have to go though hell, endure the storms, live through many boring days, and keep building up slowly to create something beautiful.
This is the longest video I’ve ever watched on YouTube (usually I just get bored after 15 minutes), it was an amazing experience, thank you so much❤
The fact that the first apparition of dinosaurs is at 57:44 shows us how old the Earth is.
scaling the time of latter eras with dense events makes most of the scale of the first parts of this video useless. shouldve just finished the latter in a few seconds just for timescale differentiation, then repeat and zoom in on what happened on that flash of a second. anyhow, ok.
Ahh the good ole days
I’m 7 years old ❤
Music is also amazing, you should upload a version without commentary and with only music and animation for rewatch!
In germany it isnt for free we have to pay Gez and the best part ist nobody cares if you watch this. But i like the series but i dont understand why i have to pay that this is filmes in english not in german.
I think the choice to represent the Quaternary this way was really touching. What a summary of humanity: we alter our environment, we cook our food, we make complex tools, we're curious, we're still so young. Got a bit verklempt if I'm being honest.
Something bout this video made me productive. Coming back soon.
Playing Fatboy Slim's Right here right now at 0.5x speed at the end would make it more real
25:14 is so cool
The mesoarchian bassline went bonkers bro
Our school books here in Afghanistan start with ( in the name of Allah) instead of telling where the fuck Earth come from. If you ask such questions there is only one answer to all of those kinds of questions which is God. If you ask to meet God or any message or messenger of God. You will be silenced.😊 so, thanks alot for the work that you guys put through to make these sort of educational videos. ❤😘
because the amount of time complex life really got down to form was so short, they had to make this vid 2~3 times longer to really feel it i think.
I love the attention to detail on this, so I will make a list of all the things thati notice  [wip]         Keep in mind that they get longer as you read because I'm a dumb smooth brain and can't get anything to be coherent.     ~ Hadean ~    The moon cooling, the meteors getting more plentiful as he mentions it, and the rocks forming.    ~ Eoarchean ~  The puddles growing, and the transition at 12:37, plus the rock patterns.                                                                                                         ~ Paleoarchean ~                                                                  The steam physics, same with the Eoarchean, patterns. Also, I love how they get more plentiful as it scrolls, and how it goes up at the end. And tell me that last shot isn't beautiful. I dare you.    ~ Mesoarchean ~  Still beautiful, and I love how there are more islands the longer you watch. Plus, the mini tornadoes and the steam at the bottom are just the most  *b e a u t i f u l*  thing I have seen so far. Plus the dive at the end. Just one thing bothering me. Why does the music turn in to "The Only Thing They Fear is You" from DOOM?    ~ Neoarchean ~ [BORING]  Nothing to say here. Nice bacteria I guess? Cool transition into the next area though.    ~ Siderian ~ [BORINGER]  Green blobs. Weird Transition. What else can I say?    We're halfway through the video, but not nearly halfway through the comment. Have fun.     ~ Rhyacian ~  The frozen screen is genius. Another detail i like is the underwater glaciers because the ocean surface is frozen.* Bubble transition from spongebob is weird because this is a Curzgesagt  ❌ Cursgesagt ❌ Kersgesagt ❌ Kurzgezagt ❌ Kurzgesagt ✅ video. Snow and wind effect is a bit over the top but still *_y  e  s._*  the transition to the third part is also   *_Y      E       S_* and the snow islands in the water are a nice touch too. I love the wind and the different colors of island and transition into land area. Also funni island in a lake on an island in the ocean moment. Music made me say "🕉🕉🕉"  *IN THAT AREA AND TIME YOU 🤓☝   orosirian [BORINGEST]  Nothing much. Just dry landscape. Not even a transition. At least show us the meteor stupid. Also, we didn't have the budget for the little squiggles or capitalization so we left it like that. I spent all the budget on emojis. D:    ~ Statherian ~ [A BIT LESS BORING]  At least we have a vibe here. Lightning and rain and rocks and the moon looks cool. One question. What the actual hell is going on there in the background.    ~ Calymmian ~  Fog. Yes. Transition is cool too. b    this is a wip, i left off at 42:17
amazing soundtrack gonna download
i need this as wallpaper
I have been using this video to fall asleep. The music, your voice, the scenery. I find it all quite soothing.
finished the video! Thank you, kurzgesagt! :)
can you plz make some frames of the animation into seamless wallpaper background? They look stunning =)
Life: We are HERE! Planet: Freezes Life: HAHA, no we are back! Planet: Mass extinction  Poor little fellas
Pro Tip: Watch the first 50 min on 2x speed 🙈😂
Can you make a 1 hour video on human history as well. ❤
its kinda wholesome to see that the moon has been with earth since the start
Wow.  Probably one of your best videos yet. The whole hour is amazing, even the moments where nothing happens, much thanks to the amazing music. Your composer really seems to have put in his very best effort for this video! I found myself both wanting more narration, and Less narration so I could enjoy the music without missing any important historical highlights. I loved the intuitive way this video exemplifies geological timescales. Again, probably one of your best videos yet.
I missed my stop on the train because i was hypnotised by this!😂
58:13 f*cking legend :)
Is this the guy from How Its Made? If so.. nice.
.
I was watching random videos. Came to this one. Best 1 hour of the day.
I saw your videos in China, and the view count is very low, probably because someone has intercepted your videos. I hope to become your authorized account in the Chinese region and promote them on more than five domestic media platforms in China.
Only this channel is there, where I can simply push like button before even watching the video 😂
What an incredable journey! ❤ Thanks for that video! Watched it a least 10 times. Got goosebumps everytime multiple times!
I watched it a whole hour not even Skipping a single second not even changing the video speed and I've realized that 1 hour is so fast like I'm time traveling😅😅
6:53 where did this asteroid come from? 8:37 where did this water come from?
@kurzgesagt will there be a german version? I would like to show it to my parents.
Oh shit I blinked during our era, what did I miss ?
Not me just bopping while I wait for the next significant event. 😄 Props to the audio engineers! 👏
The statherian is so soothing. Balm for the soul 38:50
These guys are really stepping up their music game
What are all those things falling from the sky in Hadean phase

I can’t watch this page in the same way anymore after I found out that one of their biggest sponsors is the World Economic Forum.”
This is sick!
Shoutout music guy or gal. Couldn’t watch the vid without good music to go along to fill the emptiness of time.
What's the soundtrack @ 58:46 Cretaceous? It's my fav and been listening to it in other vids too
Gambaran sederhana bahwa manusia merupakan suatu hal yang baru di bumi ini, tapi dampak yang diberikan begitu signifikan

Please include other languages in your video like Mr. Beast is doing
This is fun
This is therapy!!!
thanks for the free video that is top notch quality.
Esperando pacientemente por el doblaje al español
YouTube must be so thankful for this types of videos.
This is a great workout video. The music and sense of time in this video is great combination for cardio workout.
12:01
😅😂 4.5 million years only created in 1 hour.  How can we live in next 70 years old???😅😅
Boooooooring do not watch.
The interruption of this movie by banal, mundane advertising feels like a deeply ironic slap to the head with a wet trout.
How many times did Premiere crash trying to export this monstrosity of a project?
Watch everything in real time and all the credits!! Never did that before. B R A V O !!!
Watched every single second of this beautiful video! Thanks for the work! ♥️👏👏
This is fantastic! Would be very neat to see a speculative video made of earth’s evolution over the next 5 billion years from when the oceans boil away, life ends, the atmosphere eventually stripped away by the ever expanding sun to the ultimate red giant phase…would be so cool!
This satisfies all of my synth music cravings and all of my foley artist nerdery in one beautiful video
A video of this length but with human history would b awesome!
i watched this solely for fun and i do not regret it
~ 6,000 years ago, our true history:  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day. And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.” So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.  Genesis 1:1‭-‬31 ESV
*Now of all the amazing thing about the universe. I think two stand all above the rest.*  *One of them, is that we know so much about the universe, but another is that there is even more that we don't know.*
45:00 Thank you Bangiomorpha pubescens.
Jeeeez the work put into this video is insane brilliant 👏🏻
This is art.
It was amaizing, i felt that eath will be okay) No matter what we humans, will do to it, at the end of the day, earth and life, will be okay
Ancient astronaut theorists believe”
That ad placement at the end was legendary
10:00 but why is it raining here? need to know how the oceans formed!!
this and Melodysheep's Timelapse of The Future are videos I can watch over and over again
Literally the first thing he said is disputed
💫
Good old cosmic calendar in video format, amazing. Humans did so much in just the last few seconds of the last day of the year of this "calendar".
Why and how did the moon move away from the early Earth? Why did it stop at the distance from us that it is now?
this. is. masterpiece
Insane video, loved to watch it!
37:07
The Doom music during the Mesoarchean period is very appropriate
I handed my like, and yet i didn’t watch it, trying to schedule this for the most proper time. But still you deserve the like !!
Definitely the best video of this channel
I stopped the video but everything is still moving 😵‍💫
I ate a magic mushroom as I started the video and just took both for a ride ✨it's truly profound just how long it took to get to where we are
Love❤❤❤❤
Thomas Veith and Fabian Glaser - I loved your work here, your music made the video very enjoyable! ♥
You guys kinda passed right over the fact that the oxygenation by cyanobacteria was the first mass extinction event
You can even watch this when the YouTube app is not in foreground on iOS!!! Nice!
4 Billion Years in 1 Hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How can there be rain if there isn’t any water?
Whoever runs this channel, deserves a Nobel Prize for their educational philanthropy ❤
I feel like I've been transported back to the mid-nineties, when I obsessively played Star Control 2.  I can't wait to download this and play it on a loop on a workstation in the office.  Seriously, if you did one of these for the Big Bang, I'd watch the hell out of that.
39:37 I’m glad you mentioned this. I’ve been waiting for it the whole video and was surprised it took this long. It really was one of the most amazing things to have happened to life.
4.5 Billion Years of History to chill / game to
All those periods took really long...
Great soundtrack! Had to crank up the sound system.
Sat watching with with my 3 kids. They’re loving it. Asking loads of questions, and really loving the music. Great job. I think we’ll be back!
FANTASTIC video 🤝🏽
at 19:12 you say "there's no oxygen in the atmosphere yet", but according to the video, photosynthesis had existed for a few dozen millions of years by that moment. Shouldn't there be oxygen in the atmosphere then?
Well this won’t be the last time I listen and watch this video while working or getting through my emails. Amazing work
The  best thing ever.
sweeet
If this channel has membership, I'm 100% joining
This is really interesting! The only downside though, and you problably had a good idea with this, is that there's not so much talking. With my adhd I get zoned out and it goes to vackground and I don't process it anymore. So I rewind a lot because I noticed this. And I'm now at 17 minutes. Hoop that I can finish the whole hour, because that's also quite long for someone with adhd hahaha
Someday i will have enough money so i can buy everything in your shop. Hopefully that is soon
Hi, really love your playing. Big fan here. It would be absolutely amazing to here a collaboration with you and someone like Yamando Costa.
39:54 Did Steve (the narrator) just spit in the middle of a sentence? lmao Also, what looks like splashes of water seem to not have been animated and remain frozen in a blurry motion...  Apart from that, awesome video of course, a really enjoyable journey
Carbon plants are worst detailed :/
Thank you!
This was an absolutely beautiful watch. Thankyou so much.
I would be happy to have this soundtrack with the weather effects and everything without the narrator's voice just to listen to this while doing essays. Great music!  Unfortunately, the original album by Epic Mountain consists of six distinct tracks with missing parts and different order, and without the weather effects…
Please do sequels for this video!! Because most of the interesting historical events of the world happened near the end, for the sequels you can use narrower time window as you move towards present time. For example: - Last 500 million years in 1 hour (~150k years per second), then - Last 50 million years in 1 hour (~15k years per second), and continue on…
Very good picture this is amazing
Amazing video
45:00
Looks fascinating the narration with the graphics and if you watch the full video until 50 mins out of 1 hour nothing was there in our earth only rhe last 500 MYA life formed for 4 BYA it was just a harsh planet and kept changing ...just wow
Pork
Pork
Pork
Pork
54:50
Very cool idea! Also loved the music (y)
Where tf did all the water come from
Mindblowing!
It makes me sad that although there is a huge amount of evidence from different sources that support our current knwoledge of the reality. there are people who believe in conspirations or unfounded reasoning.
It seems like the story of live on Earth is “Okay, let’s go…ohhh” <wiped out>, “Okay, let’s try aga—-“ <wiped out>, “Alright, but now—“  <astroid>
i appreciate the little 'pop culture' references lol
WHERE THE WATER COME FROM🤨🤨. AND IF WATER COMES FROM CLOUDS WHERE DID THE CLOUDS COME FROM??!??!
WE ARE STILL IN THE LAVA HELL PHASE
simply brilliant
Good video. I wish the soundtrack wasn't as angry for the first 40 minutes. Would of been good to see water, land, and atmosphere at the same time and seen the  temperatures and elements of the times. Also a count up would be good.
I was going to watch then remembered God made the earth and explains it for me
Suggested edit: the Sun orbits around the center of the galaxy once per 250 million years. During the 500 million years of Hadean, the stars in the background can actually change a lot.
❤️❤️
this is sooooooo damn good!!!
No, the earth is only 6000 years old. stop spreading this braindead evolution lie. we need to repent and trust in the lord jesus christ.
I absolutely love this channel! ❤️
Mmmm juicy lava 🤤
Algorithm fed me this video - saw the run time - immediately cleared my schedule.
My goodness what a perfection! 1 hour just is not enough, if it had 4, 5, 6 hours I would watch and even listen to it as a podcast… Way to go… 😍😍😍 Easily one of the best videos and soundtracks ever made in YouTube…
I can see this being played in a club. Just people dancing to the music while we’re being educated.
Just watched at x16 speed, looks incredible sped up and normal
Amazing video, inspiring, beautiful and educational.
This is so amazing. I hope young people can really appreciate and recognize this timescale
I hope I'm not going to sound unsatisfied and too demanding after all the time and effort you put in this absolute masterpiece, but I was wondering if there was a version without comments to be found somewhere.  Because I am seriously considering projecting it on a wall and dancing for its full duration for the next party.  Thanks again for this gem.
“Watch while you’re studying or just enjoy”… I got baked and enjoyed tf outta this
This is the peak of YouTube. This is a love letter to the earth, the universe and makes me appreciate the journey. Excited to see what will happen in the rest of the trillions and trillions of years to come
So this is the history of the entire world... I guess
This is Genius. What about hour long segments for the more recent periods?
Go God go!!!!!!! bring it on!!!!❤
for once it's a scientifically accurate video, and not some new age ecoloogist bullshit, I salute this. Plus there's some dank beats.
quality gameplay, as always
does the music at 35:15 sound like the TMNT theme to anyone else?
ok so when you say  some microbes invent tiny armour do you mean they make tiny armour or evolve tiny armour?
So stupid 😂
@ 20:00   sounds like geneburn music from tarkov
For the algorithm
epic mountain fucking nailing it on the soundtrack on this from the start. incredible.
Bro, watch this while high, this shit insane rn!
The animation is superb~!
Incredible absolutely loved it! I wish it had a little bit more information, lots of silent moment.  Huge thanks for this amazing content.
Im digging this new Tool album.
History of the world, i guess
Love the concept, but it just suddenly started raining?? Where did the water come from 🤔
i felt a lot while watching this <3
Might be allround one of my fav ever Youtube videos - Music 10/10, Education 10/10, Visuals 10/10  Would love more stuff like this!
Came here for the vedio but stayed for the music.
fodddddddddddda
Well, looks like a ride on Trans-Siberian railway.
An interesting thing about history is that the closer we get to today, the more happens, or at least the more we know. For example, History of the entire world I guess is 19 minutes long. Everything after 4:19 there is equivalent to the last half frame of this video. If we cut away the part of HOTEWIG that deals with everything before earth, that time decreases to 2:29
1:00:43
Wow! Great work. The Rhyacian and Orosirian song is a bop.
animators havnt seen their families for a month , they did a great job
❤
This was amazing! I always have a hard time grasping the timeline of earths history and this simplified it perfectly!

This is the coolest video on the internet.
What an incredible experience. I watched and listened to this all the way through in one go and wow. Simply amazing!
Drop the music as an album!! At least within the next 500 million years!
in french please !
I could swear I heard terraria music at some points.
The perfect science naptime
This was a waste of time and reaource. It truly was.
No cats in the microwave
I want this as my wallpaper
Can't thank @kurzgesagt enough for this wonderful wonderful video! It was so much easier to help my kids understand just how much a miracle it is that we're here today. And how short a time in perspective that life has even been around. Can't praise this video enough for making this topic interesting for people of all ages!
This is some top notch stuff !
norm bass 🦍
3 minute of animation video might take arround 1 week to complete.  Sure this 1 hour video is the most masterpiece you guys ever make 🎉
Thanks Kurz Team, it was nice to put everything down for a good hour. This was worth a watch, every second. We truly dont appreciate where we're at in time right now. This video gave me more incentive then ever to continue on what I love to do, amateur geology and finally on to a Bureau of Geology here soon. Ive read about these periods and seen evidence of the eras, in todays age, but not anything really illustrated and told in a beautiful story like this. Thanks for a new perspective. This is a video everyone needs to see in their life, put down the phone, watch this, and read some books.
the music is so cool!!!
Para cuándo en el canal en español?????
Came for the knowledge, stayed for the music!
someone here listens too much TOOL hehe
I was able to hold on for 20 minutes and 3 second and I'm debating if I should watch this later or if I should watch this tomorrow
If this comment made you pause, show some love with a like I would really appreciate it.
Damnnnn , straight up  great work man, the hard work put in this is crazy
Instant save to my playlist, absolutely astounding
I really love this video idea, and the music in the Neoarchean area sounds like it’s from Teraria.
Stenian 💀
I watched 4,5 years in one sitting for free... That alone is great and I gotta say... We've reached so much as humans. And this team is the reason why I haven't fully lost hope in humanity.
Love playing this in the background. Ost is an absolute banger
I'd love to see desktop and mobile wallpapers from you guys
bill wurtz gonna be proud
Goosebumps when this(56:08) familiar music starts playing!
My 5 year old son loves this video! He sat through the whole hour with me, asked questions and understood the concepts being shown here.  What surprised me was that he finds and plays the video on his own now (at least once a day), and just sits through watching it, fully lost in it for an hour each time.  And he has the whole album saved in his liked songs on Spotify.  He’s hooked! And still asking questions and learning new words, like Sediment.  Thank you Kurzgesagt and Epic Mountain! This is a masterpiece!
Soundtrack when? No hurry. After all, it's taken us this long to get here, I can wait...
blah blah blah we all know god made humans
well what da ya know? looks like earth wasn't made in 7 days lol
What a great Video. Thank you so much for your hard work!
❤❤❤
Bro the background soundtrack goes hard and is good sleeping music
In the future the final age will be longer 😂 just proof that humans are new
44:59 the most pivotal moment in world history.
I bet this is what god was jamming out to when he pieced earth together.
ABSOLUTELY BANGER HERES A BOOST COMMENT🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn we had edm back then 😮
Could it be possible that there was complex life in the Siderian but no archaeological trace is left?
the last 100,000 years would definitely be a good watch
dude said about a whole paragraph of information, 90% of this video I was skipping through to hear something interesting. If you spent an hour of your time watching this video, congrats! You single handedly figured out how to waste time the in the most efficient manner.
Please please please please make this video in French PLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSEEEE
Music during Neoarchean is so good :D
Mesoarchean age starts 🤘😡
Spectacular.  Thank you.
WHERE CAN WE GET THIS SOUNDTRACK ???😍
Nov 24 2023 love you Jayke and Camila
The fact that scientists and geologists were able to accurately identify how the earth formed with the knowledge of just 1 second is a true restement to the humanity.
the outro music is a banger!
OUR PLANET IS VERY SPECIAL WE ARE EXTREMLY LUCKY TO HAVE IT. BUT IF WE CAN'T DO OUR PART AND TAKE CARE OF IT WE CAN'T ENJOY WHAT THE PLANET HAS TO OFFER.  WE ARE DOING ALOT OF DAMAGE TO THE EARTH AND WE KNOW IT. US HUMANS NEED TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER AND TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE PLANE THAT GOD MADE.
Can we get a whole album of that Mesoarchean music? That could go so hard
I cannot stress how captivating and beautiful this hour was. Thank you everyone that work tirelessly to bring us your beloved work.
Want a great saturday afternoon? 1. Put this on. 2. Make some pasta. 3. Reflect on how good life is.
And only some people live to 100
This has been my favorite tool concert so far
of course the fucking sex algae is called "bangiomorpha pubescens"
If any Kurzgesagt video deserved to have end credits, it was absolutely this one. Congratulations to the entire team on ten incredible years!
Can't speak enough for how good this is. Thanks!
An early bug travelling a millimetre a month would have circumnavigated the globe by now.. Gosh.
1 hour of relaxation🙂
Amazing work!!! <3
lo fi beats to chill/evolve to
Now do one an hour long specifically pertaining to human history and then the universe’s history.
To think we did so much in such a short time… how come no other species could do the same?
In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.
more like this please! the educational and artistic value here is unmatched.
With each eon that passes, the question on my mind is: "If I had a time machine, how dangerous would it be to me if I were to visit Earth at this point in time?"
Super
damn earth's core is only 1.5 billion years old
All of human history: a blink in one hour of video. 😔 Amazing and depressing and interesting ... Mixed feelings.
I don’t believe any of that! In my opinion that is bullshit.
This vid gave me melodysheep vibe. Still one of the best video I've seen.
this is an instant classic. coming back here every day for when i'm doing emails/ any tedious tasks
the music is immaculate
Kurzgesagt knows that a lot of their audience is getting high so they made the perfect video to watch high.
Imagine this video had 4,5 Billion views 🤯
23:17 the music changes
22:19 when the doom music kicks in
Banger
Awesome!!!
I decided to watch this as a movie night at home with snacks. I really enjoyed how fascinating satisfiyng it was to watch this. Keep up the great work!
SAVED MY LIFE day after Thanksgiving dish-washing: threw my air buds in and made it all the way to the Ectasian! That’s a long time to wash dishes
45:01 is the best part
ok kurzgesagt but when can we get this video in real accurate time
I feel somewhat ashamed of not being able to finish this video without checking social media in between... millions of years are passing by and yet I can't even hold my attention span for 30 seconds.
I’m sure just the script and storyboard alone to probably several weeks or months let alone the animation definitely took at least a year! Good job once again
I can’t believe you have been working on this for 4.5 billion years
What a video! What js your favourite time point? Probably Calymmian for me! 😁
The concept is wild , but the video really seems botched to me
I love this. I watched it over the course of the last 3 days as I laid in bed until I got sleepy, and last night after finishing it, I was awed enough to rewind it back to the beginning and start again. Thank you for making this, it was beautiful. I love paleontology, and this scratched an itch of mine. A couple of years ago I mapped all of Earth's history over the course of a year, so my phone rings with notifications when a new era is entered. The last few days of the year are a flurry of notifications as we near today.
phenomenal animation and art
can some explain why the third eon isn't same when i ask google what is the third eon- and the rest after the 2 eon. example:  is it the Paleoarchean or what google say Proterozoic
Bravoooo 👍👍👍
Each second is 1.5 MILLION years. This evolution thing is PAINSTAKINGLY slow. Great animation guys. This was awesome!
Bill Wurtz: pathetic
This is quite possibly the greatest scientific video I’ve ever seen on Yout certainly in top 3 for me. I’ve seen others explain the condensed earth time theory but never like this. Hats off to all who helped this !
oh were going a bit fast
This is a sublime journey! I actually watched it fully first, enjoying some coffee and a much needed break. Since than I had it running in the background while working a few times - the perfect mixture of background noise and stimulation.
PURE GOLD!
'The first fun guy forms then do fun guy things...' I liked that bit
God the music and this is amazing!!!
This was epic, loved every second! Thanks 🤩
I love the dinos and moon formation :)
yesss...... Best one hour of my life!
Props to the cameraman who filmed 4.5 billion years of history for free
life on this planet was definitely seeded from outta space; i don't mean aliens like that we see on movies with a guy in a rubber suit, but microbes, small life forms, are 100% in existence beyond this planet
I love this channel thank you so much for everything. The Immune book is great as well(much like a textbook but prettier),highly recommend.
Still waiting for some warm words for Steve :D (thanks Steve perfect voice for this channel)
This is My favorite vídeo on YouTube now! I use for background work and study!
Kurzgesagt did again for us 🙏🏻🩵
And in that 1 second we have already stuffed Up the earth
I REALLY enjoyed this video. I saw some different art styles aswell in between the eras. Id love to see more like this!
what did take so long to start the explosion of life what was the spark that caused single cells to start developing rapidly
This video will be very useful when it's translated into Portuguese, as a Geography teacher I will certainly use it in my classes
1 hour!? This is a feature film!
I would wish this get made into like an animated desktop.
Listening to the music in the background while making the assignments.
Sex was invented 1.2 Billion years ago
Now make brown dwarf star life:)
Can someone give me the tl:dr version?
"the first fungi like organisms extend rheir tubular arms and do fungi-like things" 😂😂😂
This is better than the bible!  😉
Lol bull shet
So basically when we say 300BC is "ancient" it's all bullshit
A pinnacle of the free internet and a credit to you as a channel. The world needs more people like you.
I know you intended us to watch this passively in the background while we do other things, but the amazing animation and the drive to find any easter eggs has me glued to the screen
I missed the second of human existance on Earth.😄
53:47 Wake me up (wake me up inside) cant wake up (wake me up inside) save me (call my name and save me from the dark)
This is a masterpiece. Incredible.  Thank you, so much.
1:00:40 😊: Don't blink or you might miss all of human history  Yeah, an ad appears😢
The hadean era lasted as long as complex life has been around… Wow
the entire kurzgesagt channel is such an insanely cool concept to me. and everything is so super interesting. I really love these videos
I love this extended version. A hot tip for a revised version. Comming from a geologist / zoologist, there is so much more commentary that can be included in the video. Please PLEASE re-do the audio so there is less than 30 seconds of silence, maximum. So much is going on in the current gaps between commentary. I'm happy to help with suggested information 👍
creation of life got shorter and shorter and now we're over-populated lol
This should better be the most watched video on this channel. the amount of dedication 🤌🏻
Please give us a simulation game, Kurzgesagt! I'm talking SPORE level, but even more detailed :D  Let us build dyson spheres! Manage food, disease, resources! Let us terraform planets, socialize with aliens, research new technologies!
Thank you Kurzgesagt for this incredible video, I watched and enjoy each million year of this video. I loved the journey of mother earth, forming, deforming, reacting, evolving, growing and the masterpiece work of art with great music to enjoy. You guys are truly unsung heroes!
Made In Heaven
the music is fire …
This is epic 😳
Excellent. You get the entire picture of earth's history in an hour. That's an hour well spent. Loved it.
this is so cool.. what a piece of art and science
Dang, if 1 second is 1.5 million years, Then today i would be more than 567.690.608.800.000 years old, that's 567 trillion years!!!   Yes i counted it, but i count with calculators XD
I remember watching something similar to this on The Discovery Channel as a kid. This was truly fantastic, and I loved every second of it!
where did thwe music come from?
Eu, esta re guapo, me gusto una banda, felicidades a Kurzgesagt, es un video maravilloso con la perspectiva de la realidad, so tank u very much, I like how si made, tanks all people that make this posible 🤗
Wow. An one hour animation. It would have took months to make this video All important events are well described and such a good amimation!
...and we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference.??.-- George Carlin
AMAZING!  So far the best video from Kurzgesagt.  All I needed was a bit of patience to see all at once.  Highly recommended. Thank you! 😀
Props to the camera-man for recording earth for 4.5 billion years 👏🏻
The amount of hard work, talent, and passion in this video is sooooo commendable! Thank you, Kurzgesagt, for allowing us to experience such an amazing journey! Happy 10th anniversary! 🎉
Listening to this with a good headset (currently with a PS5 Pulse 3D) is preferred. This must have taken so long to make! The music and animation in this hour long adventure of Earth's timeline is well thought out, detailed and entertaining. This will be a rewatched a lot thank you again for this! Shocked this is even free.
What this video really puts into perspective is how monumentally tiny human history is compared to the earths It didn’t even fit in one screen and i spent like 20m watching it rain
20:29 dream theater?
29:42 it glitches
I really hope your animators are paid enough to live, these are trying times and they clearly are working very hard
hiii, i have a question, kuzgesagt do you believe of god? is just a question
love it and ik the work put into this was alot you guys never seen to disappoint. it would be rather interesting to see this but. in the context of humans like the history of humans in 45 miutes
Gorgeous video ❤
Incredible!!! Thank you for this
Exclusive Lofi hip hops by Kurzgesagt 🔥🔥🔥
*raises hand* The moon is continuing to drift away from earth, right? Will we be swallowed by the red dwarf that our sun will become or will it fly off into space first, based on our observations?
Es ist nicht so kurz😂❤
Part fiction , part fantasy, part true. It's amazing how humans believe all the mqde up b.s. by the so called scientists
i'm amazed how i can watch for almost an hour and learn little to nothing. One fact per era? i learned almost nothing about each era this video could've either been 10 minutes long, or should've had much more information packed in. The length feels gimicky to me, seeing as 99% of the video is ambient music along with a nice lil scrolling animation.
Whoever filmed this deserves a raise! Noice job!
Life, uhh, finds a way!
I really like watching this video if I want to go to sleep. The music is kinda relaxing.
Wonderful work! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Huh.  I did not know that Earth's core formed after life did.
The chronology of our terrestrial home in its completeness, I'm inclined to assume.   (P.S. whoever gets this is a real one)
Thank you very much for this, Myself and a few others i shared this with really enjoyed it
This a truly mesmerizing piece of art and science on every level. I will play it again, be it just for the soundtrack. Thank you for this masterpiece of a completely new kind
Life needed so little time to appear, but so much time to grow and evolve. 😳
i still don't get how you get life without God? you can't just mix water with some minerals and get a frog, if that was the case the galaxy would be teaming with life.
It's like watching a movie
Amazing
We don't deserve Kurzgesagt.
only channel I have my AdBlock disabled for
Kurzgesagt casually getting into the Lofi scene. I'm here for it!
I loved everything about this video. Made me think about something though. Whole alien civilizations could have landed finding early Earth good for them, lived, thrived and died in like 2 million years and we wouldn't really see much because of how long ago it was and how much happened to the planet.
Cool! Please do the same for the preceding 13.8B years. We've (collectively) got time. Also I love that this is just an hour long mix of the Vieth and Glaser gang at epic mountain. The last second was hilarious.
im actively watching the whole thing, this is awesome! maybe the best try at representing the imense scale of time
How can y'all make this for free without sponsors or ads OMG thanks a lot this channel is the best.
😮👍🏼🫶🏻
The fact that I made it through this in one sitting says a lot. I love Kurzgesagt!
That was unbelievably beautiful
music and animation is splendid, thanks for your work. loved every millenia ;)
AMAZING !!!! LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!
Please give me the soundtrack, this is sooo good!
Amazing, and awe-inspiring video. Words are not enough to describe it!
So much work has been done to put this educative video together. Let's all appreciate this massive work.
Monkey at the end
Wow man! EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT
How do you fooking know that is true this is just scientist tentative opinion  They are all lying us
Not even done the video, but i had to make this comment... the bass during the Mesoachean era is absolutely fantastic 😩
This is pure youtube art 🤌
I absolutely love the synth-heavy soundtrack.  It is so relaxing.
Shoutout to the algae that invented sex
This video is so soothing it makes me fall asleep quickly 💤😴
Are there any metalheads in the sound design team? The soundtrack has a @theoceancollective vibe that I absolutely love.
29:43 lmao
Greattt
Just wait for the beat to drop!
I'm in absolute awe that the planet knew how to change periods so swiftly as though someone said, it's time now - change it up. Life is a miracle.
Every single SECOND in this video is about a million years. More than the entire lifetime of our species. Think about that. All those billions of years where so little happened could have encapsulated our entire history, thousands of times over.  The other thing I wonder is: how many times could life have reached a stasis point beyond which there would be no pressure to evolve further. Think about it - without the additional nutrients provided by plate tectonics, it would have stayed as archaea on the ocean floor. Without the ozone created by photosynthesis that created a shield from the deadly lazer of UV, it would have had little chance on land. It's so hard to think about alternative paths because we have a grand sample size of ONE for life in the universe so far. But the fact that all these things had to come together, and that it took so long just to get to multicellular life, to me implies that there are relatively few worlds that are as bucolic as this in our universe. Many places have microbes; perhaps EVERY place where it can happen, that at least does. But our macroscopic, stupendously complex multicellular biosphere may be an exceedingly rare oasis in a desert of a galaxy. Let alone any individual species coming out of that who MIGHT, SOMEHOW make a technological civilization that won't destroy itself, and be visible from interstellar distances.  Odds are, no one will ever know we were here.
This is not just a very educational, and nicely animated video. It will be my favorite videoclip from now on. What the Kurzgesagt team did here is ART. Pure art. Thanks for your 10 years of work, and I wish you a few more billions of years like those!
Amazing video but bill wurtz did it better
Unbelievable 😊
OMG 😳😳😳
Just in time for my historical geology class
Album?
people who like this would love melody sheeps timelapse into the future
It's an hour long, and all of human history was less than 2 seconds.
This is the best channel on youtube, by miles
Thank you for your truly awesome animation and this great opportunity of get a feeling for the history of earth. I only humbly wish you had visually included all other mass extinction events into your animation, like you did for the Cretaceous (33:54 in Orosirian, 53:55 in Ordovician-Silurian, ... in Devonian, 56:55 in Permian-Triassic, ... in Triassic-Jurassic, 59:47 in Cretaceous-Palaeogene)
Sound track is amazing!  I wonder if they would publish a version without the commentary but just the music. That would be amazing!
This has some Koji Kondo level music. 🔥
the music is fire tho
Amazing work. Thank you <3
That small rendering glitch at 29:42 is the most Adobe-thing ever lol
I abso-friggin'-lutely LOVE this video!!! Learned so much and will come back again and again!
Add average surface temperatures and oxygen / carbon dioxide atmosphere compositions as well!  Already an extremely superb job!!!
I can't believe I watch thru all this only to see the humanities history is just a Caveman lol
Can you make video in Hindi language please sir ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can you make video in Hindi please ❤❤
Human age... is just a blink of an eye...
Oh my god, this is the best video on this platform, hands down. You guys don't fail to amaze me.  This time around, you guys NAILED IT with the music! I love this progressive trance/rock that you brought on this video, the drum line is beyond measure, I picked my guitar and started playing, the notes flowed like water!  I cannot thank you enough for the experience I had with this. I'll come back here every once in a while for the rest of my life.  Major W on this one, the best video of Kurzgesagt.
Canadain school has failed me  i was tought dinosaurs first roamed the earth 365 million years.  100 mill off
the moment you think ... no, I've come so far
Awesome video!
Perfect content for driving
This channel is pure gold!
That algae in the Stenian period is the true hero. 😂
19:40 Sounds like it could be the beginning of a TOOL song. Very nice.
I feel like they switched styles during making of the video, some of the parts are extremely detailed and some feel like concept sketches. But overall it was great journey and great project!
Loved every second
What is that music that starts approx. At 4:00?
29:43
this would be great to put in wallpaper engine or just a static wallpaper is enough
1:01:50 what is this song called?
44:59 Bangiomorpha pubescens is a gigachad. Surely it's also the genesis of the words "To Bang" and also "Pubes".
10/10. So much appreciate
Holy moly 1 hour? Bless you
Missed humans
The algae has invented sex y'all
I feel like this is what it must be like to be a god. You look away for a bit to do a chore and suddenly the planet you were watching is covered in water???
How did it rain for the first time without clouds😢
I'd leave this in my Wallpaper Engine and be reminded of our planet whenever I can
My guys this is amazing! Absolute wonder of a video. The set playing in the background deserves insane praise. Germany is the GOAT of techno and boys delivered! Please please please release the video with just the soundtrack so i can play it while i do my daily house routine 🙏
haa, the floor is lava...
Eoarchean music really slaps
Bravo! A masterpiece!
We’re blessed
The scariest thing, if thus video went one more second you'd probably see another extinct event caused by ourselves and climate change or nukes
This is amazing work you guys have done, 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
58:13 Dude, it took me 83 million years to realize this was a Jurassic Park reference.
The drum is perfectly in sync with every million years in the Stenian era part.
Nice! this is a very clever video style, i like it a lot. an hour well spent!
53:41 Anomalocaris :O he’s doing his best :3
These kinda videos give you a whole different sense of perspective and makes you appreciate the earth's current state so much more. Yet another Kurzgesagt W
This video is so cool! great idea for a background playing video
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY! 🎉❤ SUCH A BUMMER VIDEO, THANKS KURZGESAGT!
Absolutely breathtaking from start to finish, the music, the animation, the narration, all astonishingly beautiful, brought me to tears and made me laugh. truly incredible work. I have never been so proud of a YouTube channel.
39:45 The eukaryote merge happened during the Rhyacian, almost a billion years sooner.  30:24 - 31:26 I think you misrepresented the Huronian glaciation, which lasted much longer, from the middle Siderian to the very late Rhyacian. I feel like you could have said a little about the Ordovician and the Silurian, at least something like "fishes get bigger", also the predator/prey pattern developed around that time. It would have been nice to get a bit of animation for the Permian-Trias extinction, it's the most important deathly event in the history of life after all. I understand this is meant to be entertaining, and not necessarily educational, but still, the lack of information and accuracy is a bit disappointing.
Every single second was an artwork
It's one thing to understand the concept of deep time on a conceptual level, but to experience the seconds go by, and actively comprehending the millions of years that equates to..it's a profound experience. Thank you for sharing the fruit of this gargantuan undertaking.
20 minutes music starts hitting real hard
The floor is lava
great video to study with!
Coolest music video ever, been watching this while working.
Song?
Man enough of the theories 💀
This shows that the cameraman is god not only did he survive the earth being created but he also waited millions of years to record this
The beginning was like an egg and sperm cells on a macro scale. But what to I know 😂
Really speaks to the resilience of life that it looks like the moment (relatively speaking) the planet reached the point where it could survive that cells formed. Like, life indeed finds a way.
When does the thera impact happen?
Where did the rains come from?  All the water?  It goes from fire to water. How exactly?  Did the water come from the asteroids?
This soundtrack slaps. And the animation could pass as a really cool visualizer in a party, lol.
I wonder what the next 4.5 billion years will look like.
Der Soundtrack ist so geil, so meditativ, und die Zeit realistisch dargestellt. Ich habe, vor auch wegen der Musik, die Stunde sehr genossen. Sehr gut gemacht.
Dude, can you travel back and ask the asteroids where they got that boppin music?
An incredible video! I loved when they said "Don't blink or you'll miss the whole human story..." Then it ended lol
where does the rain come from? does the meteor cause the rain?
This is awesome 😊
I loved ❤this so much, thank you 🙏
This was absolutely incredible, thanks for all the hard work from all involved
I seen it done in 20mins lol 😂 still soild vid
did not comment first time I was, so, now better no forget now. Amazing folks <3
Perfect video to watch for what I was doing. Thank you! 🥹
Dude I was lessening to this while on a calculus test and I got an A 💯 love this video ❤
The countdown to 66 Mya in the Cretaceous was heartbreaking. Every second felt precious and then it was over, just like that.
Fantastic, amazing video. Incredible. The amount of work behind it is tremendous. Thanks Kurzgesagt for giving us this high quality content ! 👍👍👍👍
So with the sun having about 5 billion more years till it explodes, the worlds entire existence would be about a 2 hour Kurzgesagt video
Imagine they put a hidden duck in each era.
I absolutely love this but is it possible to get one without the narration?
58:13 goteeem duuuudeee
This video is amazing! The visuals and music are top notch! I want the music on spotify. Great job as always. Thanks for all the effort!
I wish this was my Roku screensaver instead of that purple city skyline thing.
Shoutout to Bangiomorpha Pubescens! Nobody ever appreciates the guys that lay the groundwork, am I right?
This has got to be one of the best videos ever. Such a long educational well animated and composed video.
Pop a bean and put this on!
this is incredible. you should do this again but with only the history of humanity. i would pass every history class i ever took after watching something like that
Go team! I watched through it all because I KNEW that this had to be a passion project and I want the YouTube gods to know this was amazing!
This rlly destroyed my perception of time
Now do the other 9.3 billions years hehe Jokes aside, great job m8! this probably took years to produce...
I can't believe the cameraman's dedication
I'm surprised you didn't mention "The Boring Billion" by name. But all in all, a fantastic video!
This is insane
Imagine the way life would have evolved had these extinction events not happened. We most likely wouldn't even be here.
I don't care if this has been done mostly by AI, I appreciate this so much. Maybe we all will come to appreciate more uneventful tasks once again.
The Background music is amazing. The Music reminds me of Terraria music
It's trippy to think that everything that currently makes up you right now was still around in some form even 4.5 billion years ago (just may not have been on the Earth yet)
this really puts so much into perspective, and i feel as though i still cant grasp it no matter how hard i try. we truly are tiny
35:15 Started busting a move right here, this music goes hard haha
This had my children (4 and 5 years old) mesmerised. Thank you for stoking their curiosity.
@59:40 Whats that? La-Vos?
amazing
That green vent at @13:00 is a bit sus
I feel so unimportant watching this...
Newsflash. Earth is around 7000 years old. Trust me. Earth was not lava, but water. Mock me, laugh, but it is truth.
Love the soundtrack💌
this is so cool and must have taken forever! thank you!
The camera man:
Full fake history. This cells cant form in to plants or animals, this is gods creation noobs.
Earth has been a moist rock for sooo loooooooooooooooooong holymoly
Kurzgesagt has long been my favorite YouTube channel, but with this brilliant video you have once again outdone yourselves. Thank you so much for your great work and tireless efforts to provide us with such masterful educational material. 🥰🙏
Aonde estão as legendas pt-br!? Estou ansioso por ela!
I am quite proud living in Perm city, the Permian period with big instinction is called of😈
You've impressed me, thank you, you are superb
Oh God, we are so so new. Well, its comforting to know how many extinction events there have been so far, if we mess things up life will probably find a way
You literally  have made  a  masterpiece  I  mean when  I  think that humanity lasted for a  fraction of second and my life for a fraction of fraction of that second
Marvellous. Riveting educational video or slow TV - watch it however you like. Happy birthday Kurzgesagt!
Awesome... Thank you very much!
life is so precious, it's so sad to think that humans have almost wiped out all that the planet has accomplished, all for power and money.
look, marty! it's biff tannen's distant ancestor, bacillus tannen!
i have this on loop
Kurzgesagt the techno club
pixar should make an animation based on these single-celled organisms 😂
it's beautiful. thanks kurzegesagt.
Hats off to kurzgasegt ....... Atleast put a part of their effort in a comment praising them whole heartedly and express your emotions while watching the video, you don't have to make it famous or put effort in marketing them........just chat what you feel while watching the video.......... Our words are their encouragement and motivationwe should be glad for these sort of content.........1 hr video ! Amazing animation ! Masterpiece of soundtrack! They spent freaking 4-5 years in this video..... And putting it for free ?     These guys are no less than saints , i am just greatfull for them just for their efforts 🎉🎉
08:00 is water in the ocean always salty?
44:55 LET"S FCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOO
The fact that life showed up almost as soon as was possible says a whole lot about the universe.
it took a long ass time 😅
Hats off for the cameraman... 😅
This is great, please keep it up here for the next 4.5 billion years!
The basic animations coupled with the lack of any gradual changes, between the epochs, really took me out of it.. Found myself skipping chapters after the first narration on each.
love how they went through the effort of animating sun and moon like a cycle
Amazing!👍🌎❤
It really puts into perspective how long the earth was barren.
So cool. I watched in a few sessions - my ADHD wasn't going to let me view the entire hour in a single sitting! Well worth the effort. Thanks so much for this unique video! Every cent I spend on you through Patreon is entirely justified.
wow...
Where's Mochi's Credit?
29:42 glitch in the matrix
I didn't know Tool was a band 2.5 billion years ago.
What a beautiful way to show us how insignificant we are in the history of Earth.
Each era or geologic period needs it own video. Thanks for this.
amazing EVERYTHING its (I have no way to describe it) that all of this is free no srsly this was a absolute master piece
Absolutely amazing! Forever grateful for the fantastic content Kurzgesagt
bro....the human history...................AAHAHAHHAAHAAHAHAAAAA............ITS FELT LIKE AS I JUST HEARD AND SAW THE HISTORY OF HUMAN...........FELT ALL HARD WORK OF HOURS OF STUDIES IN ALL NEPOLIANIC WARS AND ALL OTHER WARS........AND HISTORY...........AS IT SHOWED AND ALSO SAID ITS THAT IT............REALLY FELT ......BRO I HAVE COMPLETED THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY...........THATS IT THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT ALL IN SINGLE SECOND.........PARALALLALY FELT WHY DID I EVEN STUDY SOO HARD FOR A PUNY PROSPECT..........
Just wanted to say, approximately every minute that passes in this video is the same amount of time it’s been since dinosaurs died.  And every 100th of a second is equivalent to the whole human era
Would it be possible to eventually (maybe in a year) reupload this video with the same animation and music, but with some more narration? Some more facts and explanations of the facts would be awesome.
great video, but ultimately there is no answer to how the first living thing created itself - assuming how the world came about is fine, we can go with that but the fundamental question is where did life begin, how, why - this will never be answered by evolution. But a great video nonetheless, i appreciate the effort gone into it.
MVP : Algae Bangiomorpha Pubescens
Beautiful! ❤
Yay!  Never saw more than 10 minutes at a time.  An hr!? Wow
This is a true classic, just insane to think about all the work that must have gone into this. Awesome animations, a solid and convincing soundtrack... what's there not to like? That was a fascinating hour of my life and I plan on watching the whole thing again later this evening.
Every frame in this video is about 25000 years!
Wow, so every second is 125 times human civilization! 🤯
Epic and deep!  Happy anniversary!
Its sooo crazy how short the human history is compared to the entire world
Babe wake up new History of the Entire World I Guess just dropped
Thank you so much for this! Everyone on the Kurzgesagt team deserves a WONDERFUL WONDERFUL praise!! I can’t even imagine the amount of time, love, and care it must have taken to make this! It’s a masterpiece ❤❤❤❤❤❤
44:58 Bangiomorpha: _UOOOOOHHHHH!! SEEEEEEEEGSU!!!_  Okay, in all seriousness now, this video was incredibly beautiful, and the dedication you put here really shows your passion. Here's to more 10 years of amazing content!
19:18
That was insane you blow my mind😂🎉
I'm not sure if I missed something. But why did it suddenly start to rain? Considering how rare water seems to be. Where did it come from?  Great video ❤
They should definitely do this for the other planets I would love to see how planets like mercury or even moons like Io or titan are thought to have been created
stunning. visually lovely as always, but my god that score! The audio in this is just out of control. So good guys!
the music slaps in this video
U can do the whole podcast on history of food .. pre-historic food to the evolution of today's food .. what and how changed in this and where we are wrong in this
This is the greatest youtube channel in 4.5 billion years of human history.
That was amazing, loved every million years of it. It’s important to regain that perspective  of our history every now and then.
THIS WAS AMAZING! Huge shoutout to the music team for adding such a nice and powerful tune over this whole montage! Love to the whole Kurzgesagt team!
This was like a Kurzgesagt techno rave... bobbing my head through the whole video lol
Oh I LOVED this ! Experimental projects bring out the best ! Thank you for creating this :) I think I'll buy a few posters for Christmas presents !
1188 million years ago, bangiomorpha pubescens (lol) invented sex. Here you are, still not getting any!
this is so cool
This is one of the best videos every made
Awesome video! Super music.   I really hope for hour long no music (only audio) version for DJ´s to make their own.
the mesoarchean and cretaceous are my BOYSS
I just finished watching this entire thing
I LOVE SIDERIAN'S SOUNDTRACK
Where is god?
the best video on interent
We are the descendants of the most resilient forms of life during every era of Earth's journey. The fact that life survived the Cryo period, and then the remnants of life after every mass extinctions, the strength in that and how it created space for a boom of new evolution each time that eventually led to us. Words can't capture the feelings evoked
Found a deeper reverence for the moon through this and got emotional when it reappeared halfway through. It has been witness to so many transformations, seeing life from its very beginnings to what it has become, just gently watching over Earth the whole time. It's like our Mother in some sense, or like a wise old friend
Be honest, this is just a background video/noise or a video to fall asleep to.
How did the first rain in the eoarchean era begin / happen though?
Incredible video!
This is just a timelapse of me procrastinating my poetry assignment
As an animation student This is just Inspiration for never give up ❤
Certainly puts all of your problems, all of my problems, all the problems any of us ever had in perspective doesn't it? All of humanity's history, is not even a speck of dust in the grand scale of things. And we are just talking about the earth and not the universe here. Sheesh! We gotta learn to live with each other better!
Why didn’t you show the asteroid impact around 33:00
Masterpiece!!!! Thank you thank you for putting the time and effort into creating this!
Only YouTube channel teach like a pro level .. 🙏🙏 thanka a lot..
Everything about this video is fantastic. But what I wanted to say was the music is great too! At normal speed it's captivating and sort of mesmerizing, and at 1.25 it's a rave and rock party!  edit: Then again I'm a drummer :D
7:21 “but it’s still much hot and comfy” XD
this is a great companion to gutsick gibbon's "the DEADLIEST pattern in nature" video
Incredible 🤯
You're amazinggggggg thank you for this amazing journey 😍😍😍✊ Can't wait to see this translated to Brazilian PT 💖
Great
4 years of work?!.... WOW
Crazy to think that all of that happened just so we could have Memes
i honestly wasn't impressed with the treatment of early history as a slide show with nothing appearing to happen.  felt like there could have been more effort to illustrate that important things were still happening.
My favourite part was from the carboniferous until quaternarious. The music is lit in those parts.
My favourite part was from the carboniferous until quaternarious. The music is lit in those parts.
...and the floor is lava
And then, in the last second of Earth's existence, some hairless apes decide to destroy it all for made up currencies
I think this is the most epic video Kurzgesagt has ever produced, which is saying something
The art for the Jurassic period is AMAZING
Cool video. Definitely some GenAI supporting this. I'm guessing they built their own large language model using all their videos, then used a really large prompt to specify the sections, transitions, and music. I am also guessing the voice is AI generated because they have such a large sample. Even the text might be, based on a few grammar mistakes while he was speaking, which ive never heard before. At any rate, pretty impressive use of AI.
1 day away from finally checking out the VR game, hope it's kurzgesagt tier gaming
The jurassic Park reference got me ahah
Amazing video, wow!! I would love something like this for the history of humanity... if you have the bandwidth!
Anyone else get Tool vibes from the music starting in the Mesoarchean age😅? This video is incredible.
Dude this is like a music video 🔥🔥🔥
Discovering this while high in 200 MG of Thc Of Your pack named Do yourself a flavor of blueberries is a gem.
tu no mete cabra zaramanbiche
Watch the end in 0.000000001 times speed to see our history
So crazy to see how young our species really really is
I GLADLY bought the poster. THATS how you do capitalism. Offer the consumer an experience and provide a HIGH QUALITY product at the end. No bullshit.
Imagine experiencing this in real time. (Pretending you can just survive the extreme hot and cold parts) both the wonder of everything but possibly the boredom. Imagine the memories you would have. Edit: also pretend you are immortal so you can actually live to see all this)
I love this channel and that there's so much free content. That dedication to educating everyone regardless of their ability to pay is so important and will be increasingly so as society navigates the next 50 years. I love the easy to understand explanations and especially the what ifs back by science and what we think we know. Well done. You're a gift to the Universe. Or a gift the Universe has given to itself. Lol❤
Amazing video
This soundtrack is incredible
the music reminds me of terraria! honestly i wouldn't be surprised if the composers were the same person
And the Quaternary ended in 1950, starting the Anthropocene - a new geological epoch defined when by human activity started to have a significant impact on the planet’s climate and ecosystems.  Great video! Is there a version with just the music and animations? Could have this going on in the background for hours as study ambience :)
You guys are awesome!!!!
This is so cool! Thank you!
why is nothing on beat with the music, i see a largely missed creative opportunity here
Man this must have taken a billion years to make
8:29 "The first cells begin spreading over"  Me, exasperated: in THIS economy??
This video was amazing and thank you!  Also whoever was on that drumset during the Mesoarchran Era went CRAZY!!!!
Kurzgesagt: dedication 100, Me: attention span 100
Is there a way to put this as my desktop wallpaper?
Amazing stuff.
Love the prog rock / metal vibes in the soundtrack!
This was beautiful!!! Congrats on 10 years Kurzgesagt! Here’s to many more 🍻 More videos, more successes, more likes and subscribers! You guys deserve it ALL!!!  Would you be willing to do one of these videos for the evolution of human history?
Very nice qnd interesting. Reminds me of that out there documentary they made of was it future or past earth in the 2000s off one man's books of animals qnd no humans. Sadly even if we do kill humans and fuck up the planet. It's a freaking planet. It will heal. Honestly even if qll the stored nukes we have on earth explode or go  dead after a butt load of time. Things will evolve and change. It's q planet not a thing. It will heal qnd keep rolling on tell the sun turns the planet to qsh in q time we can no more then the planet our feet stand on know what was right were we living less then 2000 years ago. God or no go. We have very little to nothing back past 5000 years. Qnd even that is q mind bending time
Love this. I am just working at home, waiting for my calls (Call center) and I am in a good Trip for the history of this planet only with this video. Love it
Thank you guys so much! This is the Magnus Opus!
53:40 they made the abnormal shrimp look so cute
54:00 this little life form will not stop until all of it's enemies are dead.
But when the rains started in the Eoarchian era, how did the water get there to begin with?
Much hot than comfy? Otherwise amazing tho!
Kurzgesagt is so good that i literally just sat here watching the video vibing on the music for the full length of the video. Amazing work as always
Kurzgesagt is literally the best YouTuber in this platform
I thought this was gonna be The Big Bang Theory's intro played in slow motion
Had no idea 'the floor is lava' had so much history behind it
Everything on this is perfect. The education value, the ART ... THE MUSIC. I watched almost all Kurzgesagt Videos. But this was a true unique experience.
Loving the soundtrack. I now have a new found appreciation for all the Kurzgesagt tracks available on Spotify.
lol......
Missing alot more graphics and was expecting more of a bang.
It was a very good video. I missed parts of it a bit, but a longer video from the Cambrian period would be very very impressive. Unfortunately, it was quite difficult to realize at the end of the video that what evolution and our Earth have built up over millions of years, the values, the wonderful species, the pre-or lifeless variations of evolution, and the most diverse symbioses in the history of the earth, are all being destroyed by us humans. In 300 years, we will make our planet uninhabitable, we will make the habitat of animal species uninhabitable, we will upset the ecosystem and we will wipe out species, we will make a hole in our ozone layer, and we will also pollute the air, natural waters, soil and space.
Amazing video but wish that the rate slowed down when humans arose to see how we evolved
You guys really naild this one. Great job, had a blast watching
Best trip i had in a while ❤
you’ll die immediately in this atmosphere… “oh wow I’ll burst into flames” and there’s no oxygen yet “okay no flames” I like how the music after that starts to sound like doom
Every politician should watch this masterpiece. Maybe wars would end.
hi. you're on a rock, floating in space
you guys always have amazing soundtracks
I think this would be awesome set of videos if you did this for all of the planets in our solar system!
Great video, amazing music selection! 🎉Some more explanation would even be more better but it is still quite impressivw as is! 😊
I want this playing on loop, on a framed tv or monitor , hanging in my office!
top tier tracks
will wurtz shaking rn
Me putting this on speaker because I was genuinely vibing to the goated tracks until "the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex"
This is absolutely amazing, I think I would watch a movie like this in a theatre. My favourite moments were the beginning when we watched the moon form, the first rain, and how beautiful it looked before the extinction of the dinosaurs.
kurzgesagt outstanding
In the grand history of things, our lives are so small and fleeting, but we are so important. Each of us has our own profound perspective, and a story to tell. If we must be lost to the chaos and cosmic noise of the vast all-in-one of our universe, let us make the most of this infinitesimal opportunity, and spend our lives well, taking in and giving out as much care and meaning as we are able.
source ?  🤓
23:05 Man, this sounds like Doom in Egypt
Allah is so great who created this universe
amazing
Amazing, obviously, but the first 50 minutes could've been condensed into 20.
I watched all. Wonderful job.
Still in the hadean and I love to see the moon shrinking
Awesome video, and praise for the music team as well. Everything was just perfectly on par with the video!!!
Amazing. Although the sun reflection in the mesoarchean period could’ve been improved easily.  Music was incredibile, truly created a journey.
It would have been awesome to have the Orosirian asteroid impact made into a video.
Is there a way to get an uncompressed render of this? It'd make for a killer desktop background :)
wow that is a sick work, a piece of art :O
Loved it! Ectasian is my favorite part
Hi, you're on a rock floating in the middle of space. Some of it's water. Actually, most of it's water. I cant even get from here to there without buying a boat. It's sad. I'm sad. I miss you. How did this happen?
I'm still in Eoarchean, so no spoilers please!
4:32 Banger music
This channel deserves 100 million subscribers
Omg, I love this!!! God, this is so good I'm crying. Thank you, Kurzgesagt 🥹❤️
Only one human like species to represent all of ancient men wow
Amazing! You are great!
Im afraid of blinking and loosing a million years
What happened to theia?
All lies thanks for nice try😂
But where did all the rain come from that filled the oceans?
Thankyou so much it immunes me to take dive into scientific topics and discoveries, your team literally created billion of years time traveling dream into reality, I can't understand how to express this joy, Thankyou so much for this video..
This must have been Hadean to animate
Insane project! This is a super cool educational video! Really appreciate it! Love you guys.
I blinked and we're gone.
That was incredible and so well done♥
Tbh if you guys would put the music from this video on a vinyl record, I would buy it.
Longest setup for a punchline ever!
Respect to gravity for waiting millions of years to drop rocks so that it looks smooth to us
I've just watched it twice and feel invigorated.  Now to do those pesky chores before the missus gets back!!
❤❤❤🎉 amazing job
Brilliant! Thank you for this. I watched all of it. It was a hypnotic experience to travel with the barren Earth, single-cell life hiding under the surface most of the ride. The music was a huge part of the experience.  An idea for an ambitious video like this:  An hour-long video in which you attempt to show astronomical distances.
23:10
This is Kurzgesagt's Magnum Opus. Absolutely magnificent. Highly educational with animation that may have taken months. The music is great and it really emphasizes the large scale of history.
Can I also say? This music goes HARD 🔥
i would recommend if you do something like that again, the rain at 11:00 is a bit like a filter instead of rain, simple solution i think would be to make the animation loop while moving to the side, like sliding to the left, and if you match the movement speed it would seem like the rain is a part of the scene, overall great video!
masterpiece!
Never realized how short human history is compared to everything else, makes me feel kinda small.
This is free! Seriously! ❤
so much "we think" and "we're not sure how"
29:42 wth??
I am not saying Kurtzgesagt endorses drug use, but i will say that i am gonna throw away a week of sobriety to watch this high
loved every second
This is just further confirmation that Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell is by FAR my favourite channel on YouTube. Everyone who works there does fantastic work, and this video is the culmination of all of that. WELL DONE.
I am breathless 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Really awesome to see life on earth to scale! Even though 1.5m years is already hard enough to grasp, let alone 4.5 billion years.
Bro that ending!
Eyo, props to the music composer. Homie knocked it out the park.
59:58 It's mammal time! Here come the mammals, look at those breasts.
Can we get this condensed to 20 mins? I would love to learn the history of it but don't have an hour to watch 😢
I cannot overstate how incredibly fascinating and just downright COOL this is! I've been following this channel for a few years now and it never disappoints but this is insane dedication to the craft. Thank you for this video and for doing what you do in general Kurzgesagt!
Beautiful, simple beauty!!!
37:27 is the furthest i have gotten
How can it rain in period that earth hadn’t atmosphere and steel low concentration of oxygen?
Music honestly ruins this.
This was simply...AMAZING
This was overwhelming in a good way like just realizing how new we actually are, we don’t know what it’s gonna be like in another million years we might even look different by then!
Damn, to think blinking is enough to miss the period of human history on this planet compared to it's own age
This animation probably took a month to make, because there are parts of the animation that stay the same for a long time.
WOW
this is a great visual album
them single celled organism are pretty unproductive, ey?
Me watching this in 2x 🌚
Watching this was great hypnotic with amazing songs, thank you for such education way!
Where does the rain, i.e. water, suddenly come from in the Eoarchean period?
what is the music used in the cretaceous period onwards? its soo calming
This was truly amazing! ❤ The fact that humans evolved in the blink of an eye in this video made me chuckle, I enjoy that you resisted to "slow down" the passage of time at the end, it truly shows how new humans are to this whole living on earth thing
As a geologist, I really like how this video just intuitively gives a grasp on geological timescales
The Metal inspired soundtrack in Mesoarchean is killer
Imagine just putting this on at a party with the visuals as the main music 🤯 I could totally dance to that!
This is next level. Did ai help? Excellent DJ & visuals
genuinely had to pause 7 seconds in cos i was immediately launched into the fastest existential crisis of my life w that time comparison
The Nobel prize or something even better for all you guys is the less that you deserve. What a piece of art. Marvelous. Total thanks for existing, for bring us curiosity and learning in form of state-of-the-art animation (and the music, so immersive)... This video and the whole channel are a MASTERPIECE. I hope to keep watching your beautiful videos for eons... Keep up the good work and congratulations for this anniversary.
Incredible. This is definitely one of the best videos you’ve made
Praise to god who actually did this, what you see in this 1 hour approximate animation!
It's crazy to think of how precious life is when we take into consideration everything that needed to happen fo us to get to where we are today, only for our greed and politics to tear humanity and this world apart.
Soundtrack Name from 59:00 ?
Play lofi song behind it!
This whole production is amazing, but I think the soundtracks is so underrated in the comments. Such bangers, with smooth transitions, that really gives the mood and complement the epochs.
I'm surprised it didn't take longer! I draw and animate so I can imagine how much time specifically to animate this must have taken! Also the music is very nice and I enjoyed it 👌
Love the soundtrack!!!
the rhyacian song that plays is so good bro
Something is bugging me, we have Paleocene before Eocene, so why is Eoarchean before Paleoarchean ?? Anyone that could shed a light?
Watched this in one go with my six year old son. He intently watched the whole thing with lots of questions, and we talked about everything that happened. Such a cool video, will definitely give this several rewatches.
time sure is scary even at 1M year a second it still seems slow
44:59
This is epic. Around the first billion tears came to my eyes. The scale. The proportions. Truly awesome.
I like it, that when the dinosaurs are wiped out by the meteor, the moment the flash is gone you see that the entire world immediately has recovered with new life. Even though it wiped out pretty much everything, on the cosmic scale of things, the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs didn't really matter.   Ofc, this "blink of an eye" was still thousands of years, more time then the modern society of humans has existed. But still...
Damn, this just makes me appreciate being alive, so much has happened to hinder the growth of life, yet we still exist. What a rare and wonderful opportunity! 😮❤
Cretaceous was a vibe😂😂😂
What are the artifacts @29:43?
the Statherian was bumpin
My new sleep therapy.
I blinked and missed the history of humanity with the longest introduction ever...
Top tiet animation, soundtrack, and narratio! And all of this for free! Kurzgedagt is a gift to mankind
Imagine skipping ten seconds and there is no trace of humanity ,what so ever👍
Great project folks.  I thought I had a pretty good handle on this stuff, but I was still surprised by just how late multicellular life arrived on the scene.  No surprise at all at the blink and you miss it human though.  My only complaint is that there's no Stegosaurus.  You got all the other superstar dinos, and a some less popular ones, but Steggy doesn't get a look in? 😞
it's amazing this took 4 years to make!!!!! so glsd u made it in tjme for ur 10 yesr anniversary
a single video, and a single channel, to symbolize and demonstrate human curiosity and their innate appreciation of the empirical beauties around them, regardless of their own disutilities, or as you put it, "optimistic nihilism"
58:46 My favourite time in history
Was the moon tidal locked from the start? I thought it was locked when it could off but during the time it was hot it had a bigger spin.
oh my god im so excited to watch this
love the jeff goldblum line of dialog near the end.
It was such a good advanture THANK you
Y'all are just fantastic, that was great!!
अनंत फिर कहे अमर
One of the best videos on YouTube.
Amazing!
This is, in my opinion, the best youtube video ever made. I am stunned by how beautiful it is. The music, the animation and of course the information is trully great.
We don't deserve this thank you
'finally reaches the ediaceran' Good lord you're right it DID take a long time for multi-cellular life to show up.... 53:22 good lord.....
I've developed a habit of listening to this as I ride my bike home fom work since my commute is an hour gove or take..and every time I fall in love more with our home. My desire to cherish and protect it grows evermore, the more Ilearn about it. We are all stewards of this oasis in the desert of space, I'm not even talking about a god/overseeing power of some kind.  It's miraculous we exist in the first place 🎉 I'm not telling any1 what to do, though I think it's in everyone's best interest would be to keep this planet livable lol
Whomever did this soundtrack is definitely a fan of Tool lmao
I went through it all and loved it! Even the boring billions are not boring with this soundtrack.
The entire human civilization history is half a frame, it doesn't even show up on the timeline, haha.
Masterpiece
I love this so much.
Wow this video really put into perspective how much time each eon took! Other videos/books/documentaries try to explain how much time passes, but this video truly SHOWS it. This video is a MASTERPIECE!
<3
Everything about this video was amazing, but my god the music was absolutely fire. Composer was on point for this one. Excellent!
This was a great video to clean my room and chill with. Just amazing!
How comes this video can be played in the background without YouTube premium membership?
Never jammed so hard in my life, turned on the 12 sub and bro when it got to the desert vibe I broke it down so hard
every bodys talking about how amazing the animators for this are, but can we also apresiate how much dedication it had to take to animate almost the same sceene over and over again for probably weeks if not longer
Mesoarcheon period music was EPIC!
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!!
WHAT??!?! No graphic of the asteroid impact in the Orisirian?!?! My nine year old Savannah has agreed to comment with only one angry face because she loves Kurzgesact. I dissented but lost. 😡
You Germans just had to slip in a techno set huh
This become my favorite video in YouTube really really fast
Would it be possible to get a version of this without the narration? Not that I dislike it, far from it, it's just that for the purpose of studying/working, the occasional voice lines are kind of distracting in an otherwise perfect video for background play
Kinda neat that the planet got hit by that thing. Makes you think a little.
Before I started watching I wondered if I would sit through the whole video. But I was intrigued by it's story, visuals, and music that I watched it two times in one day and I will rewatch it every time when I show it to my friends. Absolutely brilliant content. Thank you.
But the moon is far older than the earth, how do you account for that?
Never thought I would hear djent in a kurzgesagt video ❤️
I didn’t realize Earth’s history was full of banging electronic music
Orosirian did not have to go this hard at 35:16, literally dancing
Really makes you think how insignificant our lives are compared to Earths history
Thankyou
Kurzgesat = 4m421n9 or amazing.
go to video while studying. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
3,6k people be like: "What do you mean 4,5 billion? Earth is 10000 years old, duh.".
amazing
I wish I could see the retention graph on this video
The Earth had cool music through most of its history, nice
Best channel ever.
what a bop
The soundtrack is awesome
This is so beautiful... thanks!
This is crazy! The amount of work put into this is insane. Great job. How did we learn all of this stuff?
I believe that eukaryotic life is estimated to have begun sometime during the Rhyacian?
i love this channel, but can you explain other things in society... like how different countries and races can unite together and do better for our planet
Who else loves the bit of the music at 31:39?
This might be my new favorite thing ever.
Fam you are crazy 1 hour of animating must’ve taken years, Your are a legend
jokes on you, bill wurtz did 15 billion years in 20 minutes!    ok but jokes aside, this is actually great content. Props to the whole team for making the research, writing the script, editing it all together, and anything else I haven't mentioned here.
Audio 👌🏻
this video feels like the newest landmark youtube video.
God created the world. In 6 days. Without death. (Genesis ch. 1-2)
DO the human era in this format. One hour  about the last second of this amazing video!
I love your animation its soo beautiful no its breathtaking thank you soo much for educating humanity on the history and the creation of earth this is more than amazing ❤
It’s still much hot and comfy  Is the narrator computerised? I always thought it was a real person
13:43 "Good job If you're still watching"...   (It's my 37th time here)  Amazing job!!! LOVE you people 💜
I just realized I can close YouTube and still keep watching the video
I enjoyed my stay xqcL
Nice! long and amazing!
This one reminds a lot of Koyaaniqatsi. Is it one of the inspirations for this one, @kurzgesagt ?
And this is one more reason I keep buying those calendars. This is proper art.
relaxing ahh video
About 1.7 billion to 700 million years ago, the Boring Billion. Despite sex being invented, not much happens here.
Soooo incredible. Thank you sooo much. I got actual goosebumps while watching life begin to expand
Amazing guys... TU so much! Muito obrigado, from Brazil.
My favourite period is triassic-cretaceous
When will the 3h director's cut, including the beginning of the universe, be released?
wow that was amazing, I was curious to see what you would do in human history and it was great, really enjoyed the video, I watched it slowly took me many days, but it was totally worth it
Happy "Decaanniversary" :D
0:00 Ryoki Tenkai : Muryokusho 🤞
Nah, Kurzgesagt casually hit us with Gojos  Domain Expansion...
kudos kurzgesagt!!!🙌
its like playing stupid NFT 9 chronicles XD
Such an interesting video! Props to everyone who worked in this, but especially to the sound designers and composers. The Mesoarchean  beat in particular is sick af!
Why does the mesoarchean soundtrack go so hard??? i wasnt expecting that. loved the video!
amazingly creative video, great info and animations! only thing i would've added would've been some sort of animation/explanation of every mass extinction that happened, not just roll over it so fast!
You probably by accident created a cool music mix for work & chill out to
Ok, now I want to play Spore again and it's all your fault.
Best train ride of my life despite the fact we were hit my a few meteors on the trains heavily armored exterior that made my ears ring for a few billion years
1 saat boyunca şunu ayık kafada nasıl izleyebilirim...
What a beautiful video
Absolutely bangin' music in this video
One of the best videos on YouTube. Thank you so much!
It's the best video that I've ever watched. I can't imagine how much effort was put in production. I wish for more creators like you!
I'm getting some Robert Prince and Mick Gordon (DOOM) vibes from the Mesoarchean track.
1 hour of animating must’ve taken years, the fact that we got this for free is insane
Iconic video - comment for the algorithm so they get $
This is absolutely nuts… can’t believe this is up for free! Letting y’all know that your hard work is very much appreciated!
I watched the whole video and it was so cool and I didn't expect the animation to be so realistic
I need to watch this high
Waw, just waw... this is the best video I've ever seen!
BRILLIANT!!!❤
Haven't stepped my foot on the ground after 1:36
I personally would like to think the Fungi-like critters found in the Calymmian looked like Tube Men/ air dancers :) - Im doing Fungi like things, waving my tubular arms
כל הכבוד. סרט מעולה מבחינת התוכן הצילום העריכה והנגשת היסטורית כדור הארץ על פי הידע המדעי. פנינה לטעמי. תודה רבה לכל אחד מצוות עשיית הסרט.
One the best channels on YouTube.
as a member of a family with many lost in the permian extinction event, i think you could have been a little more respectful than "thanks volcanos"
ngl the end with were almost home and that music almost made me cry man
Soundtack is a banger, thanks!
Left this in the background while working but the technoish drop at 16:40 made me bounce my head. Thx
Do you have version without narrative?
Awesome overview! This is great, but...  I love it that secular scientists use the argon dating method and make a guess about the initial amount of argon and use that as a basis for dating rocks and then publish the data using the accuracy of the measuring device to say how accurate it is and then make up some narrative to fit the dating. To properly use the argon dating method you have to know the initial amount of argon in the rock samples and this is hard to do unless you can travel back in time at which point you already know the amount of time it took anyways. Just look at the rock samples from Mount St. Helens that exploded in the 80:s. A geologist (forgot his name) published a paper where he sent three samples from the same piece of volcanic material to be dated. They varied from ~100 ky, ~380 ky and ~2.2 My IIRC. That's how accurate it is. The argon dating method is one of the methods of dating the Earth.  So it can be said that this is the history of the world according to the world. :)
This is amazing, thank you so much. I’ll buy merch if that’ll even reimburse a bit of the time invested in this awesome project
when and where Adam and Eve entered the picture? :)
Don't blink lol
okay I thought this video was differnt and more focused on the shorter more divers parts, but this made it somehow cooler and I love how visually strong it was in showing the time difference. Very cool. Also I once again want to tell the art team, that they did a phenomenal job. it looks great. I love the kurzgesagt art style.
Music gave me anxiety...
On 10 minute is UFO in background? 😂
Y'all should do a collab with Bill Wurtz lol. Amazing video though. Huge props to the entire team.
Bro this just sucks, you are barely saying anything and the animations are just loops, it's easy to make a 1h vid like this
Took a few sittings, but what a fantastic video! It is crazy how suddenly it went from invisible critters to now! Relatively speaking of course. Thanks a lot team! 🥰
top ! merci
Than again i could be wrong.
For example a freezer freezes food and makes it last long the ice age would make all microbs and other forms freeze and last because there being preserved like and other DNA.
Were not sure how life survived the second ice age well all microbs and all other life forms and every thing wouldnt of stoped working the ice would just stop the progress and preserve the microbs and all other meaning of life thriving fir that short amount of time.
i want to shout out the composer because the music is such a banger
Thanks allot t this chanel and for your hard work ❤
Hope me felt something!? Are you kidding man?? 😍😍🥰🧡💛🙏🙏🙏🙂🙂
Marvellous
Where is the prequel to this movie
Moses was wise enough to believe in maths and logics, rather than being superstitious about the ancient beliefs of an old earth.
Will this also be available in German? My son doesn't speak English yet, but loves your videos
Love this video, it adds perspective to the history of our planet, while being a perfect background to study <3. I would love to see more videos like this, maybe one with the history of humanity.
How did that take 4 years to make???? It's basically a loop. Could be AI generated even
Found my new wallpaper engine
I can see this all day.
I watched this entire thing in come complete awe. This is a milestone for youtube animation for sure! And the fact that human existence only lasted for 1 second... just wow
rain wont happen by the cooling of the lava... nobody knows where the water comes from.
I just put it on 2x playback speed to get through it quicker.
This is really cool, I've watched it many times just in the background. 👍
This made me cry a small bit, thank you.
can we just pause and appreciate kurzgesagt for the fact that he had to wait for 4.5Bn Years to make this video.
holyyyy! This is so absolutely awesome!!
We tend to think about life becoming more complex as an inherent direction of evolution (antropocentric thinking). But looking at the actual events this isn't the case at all. Greater complexity always have arisen due to mere chance - like the emerge of cooperative cells in the form of Eukaryotes in the Statherian - or due to compulsion - like the emerge of regulated cooperation which gave rise to body tissues in the Ediacaran.  I know this is speculation but still i'm fairly certain regulated cooperation gave a significant edge to the cells inventing it during the Sturtian snowball Earth when life has survived in heavily restricted safe haven areas like around geysers. Having this ability made them much more effective in utilizing the severely limited living space compared to non-regulated cells and cell groups. This ultimately gave rise to body tissues which then proliferated in the restored living spaces of the Ediacaran and became large in size for the Cambrian. So animals with body tissues - which we consider standard today - emerged probably only due to compulsion from an extremely harsh environment.
the composition of earth and it's process to become life itself make me believe there is a creator behind..
Says it’s all of history but doesn’t even include a sentence about my bday
I feel insignificant in this timeline
This is Quality, the amount of dedication and the hard work is unexplainable through words. Thankyou for making this wonderful animation.... Thankyou Kurzgesagt.
An incredible project and a gift to the world
At percent c should you be traveling, for 4.5 billion years to time dilate to 1 hour?
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday VS The Weekend be like:
Funded by billionaires
w video
Thumbs up to the one person holding the camera for all those years.
Someone should make this a wallpaper engine background
Amazing animation
This is quiet uninformative
YouTube should recommend this video to every people on earth
Hard to watch ❌ hard while watching ✅
Would be fun to watch the sur orbit thru the galaxy
Insane amount of work 🙀 so many micro details.... Bravo 👏 like always I learned a lot thanks for the leçon❤.
It's humbling to experience and see the knowledge of earth's history animated. Thanks guys!
42:33 yeah this is weird life popped up before it was properly shielded from space radiation
Wow, videos like this do an excellent job of showing just how little our time on the earth has been relative to its entire history!
"Good job if you're still watching"...I'm going to be honest, a big part of why I'm watching this whole thing is the awesome music I've been grooving to this entire time, props to whoever made it
Спасибо! Ваши видео - лучшие!
Great work by the Kurzgesagt team. Thank you for making science interesting.
the soundtrack tho
All that and we ended up here paying bills
this is about to be my new lofi hip hop beats for studying
Anyone else getting Terraria vibes from the Siderian Era?
still more believable than an incest factory
The soundtrack to this video has gotta be the best part of it (for me at least!)
This is an absolutely marvelous video, a truly prodigious wonder showcasing the perdurable history of Earth, life, and all the things thereof. Thank you Kurzgesagt team for your hard work and taking us on this epic journey. I look forward to seeing more videos like this in the future. I hope to see one about the beginning of the universe to the conception of Earth and the Solar System.
I'm an artist fascinated by science, and I had to battle for most of my adult years against the asinine stereotype that art and science are somehow opposites. Instead of arguing, next time I'll just show this video to the naysayers. I love you guys. ❤
Scientists : can tell you what happened exactly 4.7 billions years ago Also scientists : can't tell why cats purr
perfect for studying
Thank you Kurzgesagt
How about you compile these slides into some 25 or 50 pages of a magazine? The graphics are amazing.
21:13
Such a perfect creation with precise planning. I refuse to believe that all of this occurred on its own. Any smart person who thinks otherwise is being brainwashed. God will ask us one day how could we not see?
And in the last blink of the last blink of human history we changed the climate in a way that earth took several million years to achieve something similar. And yet there are still people out there saying that changing climate like this is natural in earths history...  This comment was made on a phone produced (probably) in china, shipped across half the world, powered by electricity from fossile fuels and sent via the internet in a first world country. So i guess we are all hypocrites at some point.
Silly
I just need to say the animators are getting their due praise, I loved how they were able to imagine these times. But I also gotta give a shout out to the amazing music producers, really killed it in this video with the amount of variety. Loved every minute.
Are we gonna loose the moon if it's going further away?
I've seen this 5 times now, gets better every time :D
Where is the 13.8 Billion Years version ? 😅 Thank you for the amazing work.
Holy smokers y'all, fantastic work!
the last millisecond of this video contains everything from the fall of the roman empire until present day.
I just finished watching the whole thing, it was amazing!! 4 years of work, truly incredible.
Huge respect to Kurzgesagt for pulling off this project, it has made discovering geological history very interesting.. would be really cool if there could be a sequel of one hour from 3200 BCE/start of written history to modern day!
This is awesome
This was beautifully made
I read the comments until the end of the video 🥂
Huge kudos to the music and sound team. Everything in this video sounds absolutely beautiful.
20:00 - THE SUN IS A DEADLY LASER
I’m always looking forward to these 😊
Watching a video like this makes "historical claims" over a piece of land sound funny. Well, it would've been funny if ethnic cleansing wasn't applied based on those claims. We are so small in the eyes of the universe, yet so full of pride.
Nice video, good job animating
Kurzgesagt is officially a modern encyclopedia
This is by far one of the best videos i've seen in my whole life
Holy mother of jesus.
Who else here is trying to sleep?
Pretty big nutshell
I loved the video but I wish they would have talked a little more about the great oxidation event and how it killed almost all life on earth somehow they just completely skipped over that. Like 99.5% of life died.
Goddamn you algae bangiomorpha pubescens!!!
Been falling asleep to this for days now
wow
Thank you to every one who worked on this. I am humbled by the effort your team.
Epic.
13:42 "good job if you're still watching" yeah.. my parents would be proud of me too for this.
The music in the Mesoarchean period stars to sound like tool
How do you know how old earth is?
No skippers button l l V
Project of passion indeed, beautiful! ❤❤❤
What an epic video, thank you for tackling such an unbelievably challenging video! ❤
Wow this video is amazing …. Pls pls pls do it also in German with that man’s voice I would watch that every night to fall asleep
Thank you SO much for producing this. All the hard work, time, and effort is absolutely appreciated by all of your viewers. This channel is absolutely amazing and I’ve been following it for ages now❤️
I'll probably come back to this video once in a while for the rest of my life. I've always been incredibly fascinated by geologic time, but I had no idea it would be the map for such a wonderful audiovisual album. This is exactly what atmospheric music is meant to be. Shoutout to the parts for the Eoarchean, Mesoarchean, Rhyacian~Orosirian, and the emotional buildup from the end of the Jurassic to the present day. The Cretaceous scene really makes me feel something. Thanks to the Kurzgesagt team for being amazing as always.
It took Kurzgesagt 4.5 Billion years to make and get this video released finally 🎉
Genuine science question: So if all the oceans started off as rain long long time ago, when and how did it become seawater? Years and years of fish sweat? 🤔  Fantastic video btw, mesoarchean era music hits so hard 😎nice
All of his story
This is the video we should fire off into space for other civilizations to discover.
Amazing. Truly. Muchas gracias por esto tan maravilloso. Lo vi a velocidad de 1.75 y lo veré de nuevo.
I kind of now want to see a version of this using all of human history. 🙏
wow. this was nothing short of amazing. well done
A pleasant surprise from Kurzgesagt! I love the music
wow
Love the Hadean Phase
This thing guides us to the existence of a great Creator behind it. Praise God
1hour of Animation plus Research and Planning the Dialogue all That for free is jnsanse
Hi! first of all, thanks for this amazing content. but as you guys suggested at the beginning, it would be awesome to have as background for studying or deep concentration with visuals and audio. I wanted to ask a HUGE favor... could you please release another version without the voice over, only with visuals and music? I would watch it almost daily on repeat! thanks for creating this amazing content for free!!! kudos to everyone involved!
This channel truly deserves an award.
Turn to Christ before it's too late!
I really really really liked this video.  I've never slept well so I've developed a habit of falling asleep to videos. I watched the video once and the played it again.  Contrary to what you might believe the music lulled me to sleep.  I love taking in information while my eyes are closed and I'm slipping into slumber and the music provides the path.
58:13 Ian Malcolm: "Life ...aa... finds a way". 😄
This has become my new sleep aid.  Every time I go to bed, I play this.  When I wake up, three or four times a night, I replay it.  The music and sounds are bumping!  Thanks Kurzgesagt!
Didn't know electronic music exists during Earth's creation.
Listening to this at double playback speed, I feel like I'm listening to a Jeff Wayne's concept album.
This is amazing!!! Although it's an unfair comparison, I can't help but be reminded of "history of the entire world, I guess" a few times.
It's truly depressing but also amazing that the human race will soon cease to exist by a huge natural disaster. That is the cycle of life I suppose.
When y’all making a video game
Humanity has only been alive for a second of that time.
that is just unbelievable , amazing job!!! thank you very much for this experience!
For the people saykng this probably took forever, most of this is looped animations. The first one was around 13 seconds of looped animations. Not saying it's not a ton of work, but i would wager they probably put more work into animating their regular length videos, that have more scenes, then what went into this.
You guys really do always know how to pick your music well
This kind of scale nullifies any national sentiment, any nationalistic aspiration. For all our sake, all humans must watch this kind of videos.
This was such an amazing and awesome watch, wow. The animation team went into overdrive for this one, major props guys. This was a wonderful watch.
Just watched it while studying, it's one of the best videos I saw, incredible! Probably gonna keep turning it on in background while studying or doing chores
👍
This truly is an amazing animation, very well done, and thank you! One question though, 19:14 you say there's no oxygen yet. But during the Eoarchean, it rained continuously coupled with lightning storms. The lightning should've produced a decent amount of oxygen from the subsequent electrolysis of the water, right? Since there was no organic material available for fuel/combustion to return the oxygen and hydrogen back into water?
It’s not free obviously 🤦‍♂️
Earth lore
This video is soo cool you learn every time something new with kurzgesagt,massive love to the people who pour their hearts into making these quality videos everytime
Thanks！
I am glad you exist! Great work and effort! No words! Amazing!
Every music you've crafted for this video is awesome, but in my opinion, that Mesoarchean Metal *slaps!*
We got earth's full core bfore gta 6
Permission to post on FB, sir.
The music during the Mesoarchean is INCREDIBLE. I mean, all of it is, but man did that stand out. That's like the Nuke a City video when the music at 1:46 starts having that pulsing quality that made think of a Klaxxon alarm going off. It's so awesome how you guys can make music that gives chills.
Orosirian best soundtrack hands down❤
Beautiful video !!!!. Better try this for the second video: Existance of Planet Earth in 7 parts. This content is based on Carbon, the test of carbon is not correct, needs to be fixed.
who else is also high and watching this?
This is the most useful thing I've ever done with my time Yes I watched the entire thing In fact I kept going back (especially at the transitions) cuz I missed so much every time I blinked
Was the bgm made by AI?
I LOVE IT‼️‼️Animation,music,narrative,EVERYTHING❤️Thank you so much🙏🥰
The music is soooooooooo good
I ended up like 🤯 Thanks for all these videos, your way of expressing things and ideas is quite remarkable!!
fan for a very long time. this video made me finally join the Patreon. bravo! great work!
Wow
JUST AMAZING, thanks for this vedio ❤❤
'and the floor is lava' loved it
excellent
it's so cool, I very enjoy it
Besides the freaking nice animations I also want to mention the extremely captivating soundtracks. I cant stop watching this. <3
So God doesn't exist?
I would pay to watch this
Really amazing video! Kurzgesagt definitely outdid themselves here!! It's so astonishing how long it took for everything to develop to the point we are today and extremely sad how quickly we are destroying it.
45:00 Sex was invented!!!! NOWAY!
I need this to be my computer background
Amazing 🤩
With all the (deserved) praise the animation team gets for this, I feel the need to specifically give a shout out to the composers for this one. The music is a seamless journey as well. Kudos!
One hour of amazing visuals and music interrupted by a British man talking
I'm really glad they avoided the temptation of slowing the passage of time down when they got to humans. That way, it shows how truly insignificant we are.
Imagine how cool a video game of this would be
Thank you so much Kurzgesagt. Huge respect for this and every video you make. Very educational, creative, fun and just beautiful.
This channel and its narrator are a part of history, love the content. Really do like it.
That's incredible
When "life begins to eat the sun" through photosynthesis. (18:08) the script then reads later that there is no oxygen... I don't understand. I thought photosynthesis, while not in plants.. would be producing oxygen as a biproduct?
Absolutely outstanding. What a great lesson in time perspective.
Loved this soundtrack! Where can I find more like this?
Huge respect, this is a great video!!! It would be great to see a similar video about human evolution
Words cannot describe my level of appreciation for you, Kurzgesagt.  I will always support this channel, you magnificent saviors of humanity <3.
this would be a great movie!
E Fun fact:i say e when i dunno what to comment
this is non sense, bs. we all know adam and eva born humanity from incest
the bill gates foundation funds this educational programme in order to promote his pursuits in science, be careful about any technology being heralded.
Excellent!
Good thing is, we like the same music. So, I have now an hour for a endless loop to listen too, while programming the next revolution of the universe. This time without radioactive elements.
some of those raindrops took thousands of years to fall past the frame 🤣
How many frames had to be drawn and how long did it take?
I am always amazed when someone says they never heard of Kurtzgesagt
I can't wait for the part 2  and also I can't believe I have to wait 1 billion years or so
Missed opportunity to call this 4.5 billions years in a nutshell
after I have finished the video, my pc is trying to run away on the desk through right.
chances of life forming spontaneously 222^800 amount of atoms in the universe 222^80 I don't need to emphasize just how impossible that is.  You have a better chance of a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling a fully functioning Boeing 737 and life just sprang up right at the time when the earth was in a state conducive to life?  I dunno man.
I was thinking as I was watching that maybe it would have been a good idea to speed up time at the beginning and then slow it down the other way as life arose, but then I thought that you don't really find good representations of the scale of time involved through all of the eras of our planet. This was the right way to go. Amazing watch and an amazing amount of effort to put into a free video. I love this channel. Could add this vid to a separate channel named Langegesacht 😊.
next year the 4500000001 follow up?
Amazing video !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I expected feathered dinosaurs
Give this masterpiece more likes, no way there are about 5 milion vievs but only 8k likes. What a shame people have to support this more !
Stenian period so boring it had to create its own drama by evolvng sexes....
Kurzgesagt didn't focus on Netherlands. It's always mountainous places
6:47 Wish that was me 🥵🌋☄🔥
Mesoarchean soundtrack did not have to sound like a bo or cod soundtrack but it did
Not ready for the fursona of the entire crew
And then Humanity and Capitalism came and started destroying it all...😔
I thought the earth was made in just 6 days 😐
Epic Mountain deserves a fucking emmy
I watch your videos while studying. Your voice is very soothing to me
that's a cool album name
Kudos on the amazing soundtrack
Just Incredible.  Bravo ! Magnifique vidéo !
What do I want to say again?
Well done editing this video You should’ve added it to the history
15 years of watching YT this is one of my fav video. Loved the graphics+presentation and music help in retaining interet.
Thank you so much for making this masterpiece, this is fantastic!  Loved the music and the animations
Imagine all this time only for humans to put pineapple on pizza. We should be ashamed.
Thank you, for the many years of brain numbing info you have delivered to us.
This video needs 4.5 Billion views :)
This is a crowning achievement. Something that is there with "I did something worthwhile in my life."
This is a masterpiece, I guess @billwurtz  Can you upload (unlisted) the same video without voice? Only video + music works better as a background. Thank you :)
Reminder to humanity, we are no threat to this planet. It’s has seen disasters far more depressing than plastics and 5°C increase.   We’re only a threat to ourselves and life will prevail with or without us.  Commented in Hadean period :P
1 hour i got cazy text ever
This. Is. AMAZING!
58:02 "We are now truly in the age of reptiles"  I would say the Jurassic was way more the age of dinosaurs than of reptiles.
Wow this is truly amazing
This video is like a wake up call of how insignificant our troubles are as human in the face of earth, let alone in the face of the whole universe. very humbling.
The soundtrack and no commentary would be a good to listen to before falling asleep.
Entire history of the world.. i guess
Thank you, Kurzgesagt! ❤❤❤
this is so hypnotizing i watch this before sleep. Love it
Nice video for getting a different sense of scale. How 'fast' things evolved in the last 600 million years or so  (even though a long time in itself)  compared to the geological stretches of time before that, before evolution seemed to kick into higher gear. Also, to realise that even that very last second depicting a human is still 1.5 million years, and that what we usually think of as our 'long'  human history since the invention of writing would only last about 0.0036 seconds in this video (about 5400 years since the oldest Sumerian writings). So even only considerig that single second of human existence, we know very little of the first 'prehistoric' 0.9964 second part.
Mesoarchean sounding like DOOM slayer about to rip and tear.
What a masterpiece!!!!!  I never seen anything like this. Gratitude to everyone at Kurzgesagt for making this happen, and for those of us behind the scenes who are all enjoying it please support their merchandise shop!
Bill Wurtz did it better. You didn't even mention that the sun was a deadly laser beam...
Absolutely fantastic Well don. Watched the whole thing on the tv, quality vibe. I love how this is over an hour and yet we get like 1 second of human existence, we are so insignificant its not even funny
Add tr subtitle pls
This belongs in a history museum. Maybe all of them should display this.
The floor is literally lava.
hottest trance mix of 2023
Absolutely loved this video. Watched the whole thing and I can only appreciate how much hard work went into the making of the video
I cannot believe a glitch made it at @29:42  I would like to believe that it was intended. :D
this video is my favourite. amazing
Never as the algorithm got my desired content so right while getting my TDA so wrong
Now I want a modern, remastered SimEarth.
Absolutely incredible, this was the best Kurzgesagt video that I have ever seen, you guys absolutely knocked it out of the park. Thank you for making this and I did, indeed, feel things.
I can watch it on my phone without staying on youtube and without premium, that’s fantastic 🥲
This is a triumph
This video is truly incredible, and should be honored as one of the top videos on YouTube
Just think, if they had done 1000 years for one second instead, the video would be over 7 years long, and all of humanity would take as long as it takes to heat up a microwave burrito.
The music doesn't suck.
Any chance to get this without audio commentary? Just with the magnificent soundtrack?
Kinda funky how many meteorites hit the earth for the first 15 mins but none of them gave out a giant fireball or something
ost sounding like a risk of rain run  seriously though- it gives me such hard ROR vibes and i say this at the highest compliment I can give
Animation glitch at 29:44 😮
A perfect example of what art is and its purpose in life.
Wow the Mesoarchean Era sounds like the Meshuggian Era  \m/
This is the very first time I've seen anyone try to do what you just did. Gorgeous. Nailed it. Should be added to science curricula planetwide.
This entire video would make a sick animated wallpaper
How did we get here?
You guys are awesome
wow

The photosynthesizers probably weren't green as shown. They were shades of red iirc.
....Based on a true story
Bro this is the best video I have ever seen
The music is really great too
WOW. Sincerely WOW. I had such a lovely time travelling and journeying alongside you all and this piece of cinematic and musical masters is just a mind-blowing experience. I saved up time to watch this and it was worth every million-year-second of this amazing movie. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE FEELS. THANK YOU FOR SHARING SUCH A PGHENOMENAL PASSION WITH ALL OF US.
1 hour of animation have earned my respect. It would take years to make this and the music animation is really good
Imagine when this video gets 4.5 Billion Views
10th anniversary? Has it honestly been 10 whole years congratulations. In a nutshell has come a long way.
*chef kiss*
This is synthwave compilation and museum exhibition fused together and I love it
I missed human history. Did I blink?
1 hour is insane💀💀💀
Thank you for making this free and all the hard work you put into it, it was so beautiful
This was such a trip, thank you.
I love so much your videos ❤❤❤
don't show this video to religious people. They'll have rage attack after this
I never comment stuff on videos but DAMN is this a masterpiece like probably took atleast a solid month to do this animation, the experience was awesome . The music was truly phenomenal and obviously narration is top notch. Hats off.
Oh my gosh this is actually fantastic, I watched this in one sitting and the music and the art it’s just AAAH I could fall asleep to this! Thank you so much for making this and it should get all the views likes and comments it deserved!💗
I loved this so much, and shared it with everyone I know. Thank you!
Welp, I feel simultaneously insignificant and also special? This video was a trip! Many kudos to all involved. 👍
You should make a video of the all universe in 3:25:00 or something
I love Kurzgesagt
4,5 billions years. 4,5 billons likes fair
Quite cool!
This was really cool, but I think the information given in it is way too vague.
This is worth it. Should be on the big screen. ❤
I love you guys
Came here for the science, stayed for the music
I wept
You're telling me,.. I get to learn, watch impecable alluring animation and hear awesome music, FOR FREE? FOR ONE HOUR!! You deserve a Nobel for this. A peace medal.  I can humbly just say you're Geniuses guys. Love you hardcore.
Beautiful concept and execution!
@kurzgesagt I'm enjoying the soundtrack so much, but there's one song missing that I'd love to have: that last song that plays from the Carboniferous era up to the end. It's such a beautiful song! Is there somewhere we can download that particular track?
The detail of animation is great you can see that moon slowly turn into dusty rocky moon from lava hell earlier and the cell that invented sex😅
very impressive video. loved watching every bit of it
One thing I really love to see in this is how much detail was put into the moon. I missed it the first time, and I love it.
The hardest part of watching this 1 hour video was the 40s unskippable ad
All of y'all better had stuck around for the credits
Only true Ogs remember the Hadean era
This was the most entertaining thing I've seen whilst drunk as fuck
1. The sound track is absolutely amazing and high quality 2. Vibes 3. This really sinks in your video that earth life actually began right after the big bang somewhere far away. Lol the second the floor stops being lava first cells show up... probably all those meteors hitting the planet. That life not beginning on earth isn't just an accepted scientific fact moggles the mind
All the respect for the video, but it was so booring multiple times that i wanted to close it non stop
this is my new bedtime story before i fall asleep - thank you.❤️❤️‍🔥💋💯😘😗😙😚🏳️‍🌈
elements mingle, phases shift, matter moves, and here we stand amongst it all. Our ancestors as ancient as time and our descendants ever enduring.
made it to the endddd
POV this is actually all bullshit and there’s actually no scientific way to know the earth was this old stop believing the same shit that the government that has lied to u  about and is still feeding you lies built on lies
29:43 Glitch! (But seriously, great video!!)
i watched it all and shared this video to my friends! :D
Very good idea, to help us visualize the length of these periods, I only wish you would be telling more info during the silence
Can we appreciate how much the soundtrack slaps
7:30 he says “it is still much hot and comfy” 😂😂😂
1.2 million years ago, nothing much is going on but an algae might have just invented sex lmao
It bothers me that this whole video started off with a mathematical lie. There are 3811 seconds in this video. 4,500,000,000 years/3811 seconds is 1,180,792 years per second. Less than 1 and a quarter. Way less than 1 and a half.
If this is even a fraction as good as "History of the World I guess" 😍
19:40 - 3118 millions years ago, doomslayer was born xD
Man, nobody is talking about it but the music in this video is incredible
The greatest video ever made!
Kurzgesagt and Risk of Rain collab i like it
Out of curiosity, at 10:00 when the oceas start to form, where does all that water/rain come from? And what explains the cooling down process?   Greatful for any answer!
Just think how that sound track would sound if slowed down to real time.  The real song of the Earth is going on right now.
Read the bible, and you’ll realize these are the last days. Jesus is coming back. Who’s side are you on?
Do the hardcore religious nuts report these kind of videos you think?
The work on this channel is always fantastic, from the researchers, to artists, writers, and narrator
Absolutly stunning artwork and Musik thx so much for this masterpiece of work
Thanks for this impresive work❤
The collision with Theia was also what caused the earth's tilt, which gives us the seasons. And it also made the earth's core spin, which gives us our magnetic field that protects us. Without Theia, we would not exist.
Need a prequel
Top
Meshuggah starts playing at 19:20, trust me.
I wasn’t ready for it to turn into a DOOM soundtrack in the mesoarchean era, but I’m not disappointed
I like this, do more
I especially enjoyed the Calymmian.
This would be good to watch while tripping haha
I love this long contenttt
This helped me sooo much for my school project about this! And itw as great to watch!
I find it amazin that billions of years have past and I'm just sitting here eating my burger, the chance of my existance even being possible is just incredible.
earth lore
The Stenian is the greatest, most important, and most impactful period of history of all time
The amount of work that went into this is insane. Well done to all the team!
What a masterpiece. Whoa.
This was just majestic !! 👌🔥
Wow.. that was 1k years per view as of this moment.. maybe it would reach a year per view and that would make 4.5 biliion views..
1 second is equivalent to 1,25 Million years. (not 1,5M a)  1 hour has 3600 s. 3600 * 1,5 Million years = 5.400 Million years. 3600 * 1,25 Million years = 4.500 Million years.  Correct one.  P.d.: I know that I’m using the international decimal separator and not the gringo one.
Crazy
You guys are incredible.
Min 7:46 by the end of the Hadean 4020 million years ago, Kurzgesagt started the production of this video
This has got to be one of my favorite video hands down! great music great animation!! i love it.
Props to the camera man for dedicating billions of years towards making this!
Im clapping! I❤🌎
This man is insane lol
It's very impressive that you worked on this video so long.. years.. Thank you!
In the animation, I notice that during the eons some changes could be noticed, like in the Hadean period, the moon slowly cooled down, and right after this period and before the oceans, I could see the small ponds also slowly getting bigger and coliding with each other and consequently forming the oceans. And the reason that the video took years to make is that, your team had to go trough lots, and lots, and lots of sites to give us the most accurate information possible about our planet's past, and the time that life gets big is amazing with all the non-verbal informaition was pupil dilating levels of beauty, your team worked realy hard just for the video and I silently complement the team for the video and I apologise on my comment for all the spelling mistakes as an end on my comment so bye bye.
I don't reguraly pay for videos or streaming platforms cause i live in a small wage country.But i would literally pay a subription on patron or whatever if you guys would put out videos like this more often
Mad respect this is a video that must be saved for the future generations as well
Bro can you do Indian mythology like all the five yugas and the people and animals   I’m sure it will be awesome❤
cool wideo
Paleomagnetic studies of Paleoarchean lava in Australia and conglomerate in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about 3,450 million years ago.  but this video says the core started forming 1400 million years ago. isn't the magnetic field caused by the dynamo effect (which requires a solid core?)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
24:19 2763 million years ago: first inanimate objects come to life. BFDI is born
wow, what a banger!
I can't believe earth went trough all that just for us to come along and completely ruin it
The fact it took over 3 billion years for complex life to evolve is why I don't think complex or intelligent life is common in the universe. That's on the perfect planet for it, in a time span taking up probably about a third of the 8 or so billion years in which life forming planets could've emerged.
Ja wierzę ze zycie jest w kazdym uladzie gwiezdnym
Proof that Cameraman never dies
what a truly original and amazing concept for a video. a true masterpiece. animation: 10 music: 10 narration: 10 (as ever) thank you so much for making this, you guys have really something so special going on over there. this is such an amazing gift it's so great that kids (and adults) nowadays have got an amazing education channel btw, i know i said amazing a lot, it's because i'm so amazed
I had to stop the video and opened in the tv. my pc monitor is not worthy. im going to display this video in a proyector during my birthday party on loop. this is amazing!
Wow.. This is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for making this and everything else. I think im going to buy some things from you again (already got the Deep sea poster and the Periodic table. I love them :D)
Hi, you're on a rock, floating in space. Pretty cool. huh?
THIS IS AMAZING! IS THE BEST VIDEO I EVER SEEN SINCE THE BEGGINIG OF YOUTUBE. THE MUSIC! 1 HOUR OF ANIMATION!. I THOUG "THE EGG" VIDEO AND THE Optimistic Nihilism – Soundtrack WAS THE TOP. BUT THIS IS BEYOND! THAT'S IT THIS IS THE CLIMAX OF YOU TUBE.🌍❤
Nah the animating wasn’t even that good lol he doesn’t narrated 80% of it. It should be free
super interesting but please...the TEDIOUS MUSIC!!  NOT necessary. time CAN be imagined passing without the thumpedy thump.
Absolutely spectacular! And now I will have to research when fungi started to evolve - or the bit about the self-sustaining nuclear reactor.....
Yo did they get Bicep or someone to do the music? Unbelievably good.
This was wonderful
What a truly spectacular piece of animation and a great way to burn a hour
Just spectacular as ever. Thanks Kursgesat, your vídeos always make me emotional. I really apreciate the knowledge your bring. Thanks for ALL.
Just when i thought this channel doesn't get any better (because it's the best), then they released this banger of a video.
But climate change is our fault, right? xDDDDD
This was phenomenal
OMG, i tho was a compilation or something, was saving it for a weekend. This is SO AMAZING, even for the level of AMAZING that kurzgesagt has us used to
i just wish there was more talking
Man the music in 19:40 be hitting like doom music i love the effort the musicians put into these videos
"I guess"
I really wanted humanity to be a jump scare!
School's should show show this video ro teach. It's absolutely amazing that we are getting such high quality videos for free.
Whats the music? Very enchanting. Fabulous work.
Hugs
Kurzgesagt is the most amazing YouTube channel ever! Thank you for bringing us this kind of content, from the bottom of my heart many many thanks 🙏🏻
So you mention each second is approximatly 1.5 million years, at the beginning. Then around 14 minutes you state that the days are faster since earth spins fasters. Are these years based on the rotation of the Earth at this time, or based on our current rotational speed?
My comment, Music: 10/10, Naration: 10/10, Visuals, 10/10, Concept 100/10
4.5 billion years of development all to work and pay bills
PERFECT.
Great video and very interesting and original idea! Keep up the good work! 💙
This masterpiece is not just a best video of the year; it's destined to be a legendary contribution to the annals of knowledge, echoing through centuries as an eternal beacon of brilliance. Kudos to the creators for this timeless masterpiece!
Animations are good as always,music is better.that makes the whole video so cool❤
First there was the Earth. Then it was on Fire It later developed an atmosphere that made the Wind Then there was Water, lots and LOTS of Water Finally Life. . .     Go Planet.
34:03 top right are year but in millions
Itˋs amazing to see this! So much work.
Just makes you wonder that all your existence was only a blink of an eye when it comes to Grand scheme of things. Thank you so much Kurzgesagt team for consistently delivering quality content, keep up the good work !
54:04 what is that thing if i can know @kurzgesagt - in a nutshell
I've never liked history lessons at school. So I thought I don't like history in general. But not so long ago I've realized it's not true, I love history in fact. It's just that subject at school had the wrong name: it should've been called "history of politics". If it was actual history in general, including the Big Bang, formation of stars, galaxies and planets, emergence and evolution of life, and, maybe, a tiny bit of human history, I would've loved it. And you, Kurzgesagt, are really helping me understand the beauty of history, with this video being the embodiment of this process. Thank you.
This synth pop track is amazing, what is it and where can I get more?
I might use this for my next soiree. Thanks.
so our planet was just lava 75% of the time
This had to have been done on a game engine or something… right? No way they did all this by tweening and keyframes
This is pretty amazing.
What tha hell Since 2019
I loved this. Really. There's no real way to say it other than that. It is so simple, yet beautiful an enlightening. I'm amazed at all the good work you do, every one of your video is interesting and well made. You are a treasure. I understand that these kind of projects are a risk you take with the algorithm so I want to thank you for it. I was it will be as rewarding to you as it was for me to watch it.
My man finally explained Everything
Commenting because this hard work deserves a comment as well as a like
this music deserves way more credit..
SPLENDIDO.
Boring video
Can we also appreciate the sound track on this amazing animation ❤
oh. my. god.
i had about a 2 billion year nap watching this
THE MUSIC! I WANT TO BUY THIS MUSIC!
53:32 is peak earth
earth is flat
Not enough talking, it's only an hour long for the sake of the scale but that's not worth it
I felt a lot actually. Love your work!
This is insane
props to the cameraman
So this is what Elizabeth experienced🤔
Beautiful
Maybe a stupid question: does not lava needs oxygen to burn?
Omgggg an hourrrw
What a masterpiece. I'm gonna show this to my kids
Please do a video on Neuroscience and Neuroanatomy!!
I've watched this a few times now.  Both as chill background stuff and just watched it straight through on its own and it's extremely rare that I rewatch anything.  Sometimes your videos make me cry with how beautiful and pure they are.  Its so obvious how much you love your work.
delete the video
Amazing graphics, amazing music, and suround sound.. i feel emotionally and mentally complete.
59:37 "Such a paradise... Life is thriving ."  Shivers
Bro really said imma solo this shii
forsen
This video was good. I have a video idea. Make a video that is one hour In 4.5 Billion years💀
59:46 nooooooo 😢😢
I love this so much, thanks Kurzgesagt 🤗🤗🤗
Steve taylor's voice is just the cherry on top🤌
good video 😀
00:00 - 03:49 🧘‍♀  03:50 💃🕺
thank you
Respect 👌👌
This felt absolutely wonderful Couldn't miss any second of it
Thank you so much for this incredible video.
Wow
Its amazing that i completed this vid in 1 go... You guys are awesome...
i want cretacious music actually. to download
This is SO GENIUS!!!!! Thumps up!
what is that palogene music i want to download it 😛😛😛😛😋😍😍🤩😘
how many seconds in eternity?
So cool
❤
Maaaaan we’re not worthy of this masterpiece!! The animation, the music, the narration.. amazing. thank you thank you thank you for it
Never seen a video like this. Absolutely amazed!
Dinousarus: Live 150 million years and dont get clever....
Mesoarchean 🤘
9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
Each SECOND was an unfathomably long time for a human to understand. 1 million years EACH?!? Absolutely insane. To think to the trillions upon trillions of forms of life that have literally zero record of ever existing. How many formed, lived, expanded, and eventually erased for all time even in the span of a single second of this vid.  Absolutely mesmerizing!
Such work started in 2019 and animating a whole 1 hour long of animation about the history of the Earth from beginning to present is very insane.  I admire such dedication and Happy 10th Anniversary!! 🎉
This took 4 years...Amazing😮
tthe greates single piece of media i ever experience in my life
What an incredible video. Kurzgesagt showed us again that they're one of the best channels on yt! ❤  and the "uhh" at 58:14 felt so random it made me laugh XD
The animals that appear on this video had to move to a extremely slow pace so we could watch them move at a regular speed. Such dedication is insane!
Actually teared up a little at the end there, really beautifully illustrated and the perfect background to writing an essay on origins of cognition! Really put my work into perspective being in the last couple of seconds! ><
Everyone is mentioning the animation, but the music is f*cking awesome as well (and I'm an animator).
The time scale is just unbelievable and unimaginable. And people still believe in Adam and Eve 🤦🏼‍♂️
Nice concept... is there a short version though?
Jesus Christ is King ✝️
The planet goes through multiple extinctions over and over and life keeps coming back... until a giant fireball lights the Paleogene. Very quickly, we pop up and quickly shall we go. But I am happy to see this art. All of it. And to know I may not witness the next extinction because of matches we lit and yet new forms of life may survive it and grow and claim this planet is beautiful. Thank you, all of you, for creating this beautiful art.
This Channel Was so good during Covid use to always watch them during online school
ماشاءالله The animation is incredible but I don't believe in evolution
Fascinating. Beautiful. Thank you!
Just finished watching this video back from back. It's just insane how long of earth history there was almost nothing going on. Only the the very end, life how we know it comes to existence. And at the last second the entire human history flashes by.  Really makes one feel how tiny and new we are compared to our universe.
after watching this video an hour straight,  my eyes hurt to the point im seeing an optical illusion where after watching the video my screen seems to move wobbly from right to left XD
wow
wow
Would love a collab with bill wurtz😂😂
Where does the rain come from in eoarchean ?
10:36 meteors vanishing into nothingness
Spettacolare
This really shows how insignificant us and our problems are. All of humanity would just last a fraction of a second relatively.
Cool
The music in this video is so amazing. I especially like the begining and from 58:42 onwards... magnificent 👌
The fuckin sick club set background music is amazing too
That was so cool! Thanks and congratz on 10th year anniversery, which I've been watching the most of that. Thank you for everything, I'm 28 Years old and it feels like your videos contributed a lot for me and how I think so thanks <3
Do fungi things
A Future of Earth?
Watched the whole thing! Loved it.
proof that the camera man never dies
Sometimes i really just want to /gamemode creative then turn back time just to see how things went
That was alot of watching rocks and water.. If you stick through the whole history. The Carboniferous was amazing after all that
“Smashed by a heavy asteroid bombardment” hear me out…
An Air Wick ad at the moment humans appeared wiped out our species!!
after 4.5 billions years social media & TIKTOK bullsh*ts exist!
Had a little giggle when they said sex was invented.
May be it would take us as much time as the dinosaurs had to become truly a galactic race. Makes me feel a little sad that I exist in the very beginning of our history to see any galactic visible achievement
Just wanna say amazing video but I also love everyone’s representative birds in the end :)
41:14 ww
Thank you so much for this! The linear time scale really puts it into perspective. But I would LOVE to see this video remixed in logarithmic time scale!
i couldnt believe when i saw the 1 hour episode. This is gonna be epic
Eu tenho motivos concretos para dizer que para mim esse é o melhor video do YouTube.
The music to this is so fantastic
This is hands down the best video Kurzgesagt has ever made
suspicious...
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Wow where do I get this music?
Should’ve put “i guess” in the title
wow, that was amazing
Ok, not trippy
in paleoarchean under water is like nature factory
This type of Video in VR would be insane
This would increase peoples knowledge of the earth's history as well as improve their attention span
This is fucking insane. I love this channel
I can't believe like 80% of earth's history is only filled with nothingness, only teeny tiny bacterias, and suddenly boom big small animals and plants rule the earth, life really love expanding themselves into every corner of the place ❤️
In the mesoarchaen, you say 40'C we'll immediately and its too hot, but can't people survive at 40C with oxygen?
Do the Universe next.
This makes an amazing workout backing track by the way :p
This is beautiful
Evolutions theorey of change of species is an evidenceless theorey, change of species as in a bat becoming a cow...
One dumb dumb question: How’s the rain came if the earth was lava hot?
44:54 sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago!
dude, soundtrack is fuckin bumpin on this thing
The biggest existential crisis I’ve had in a while
54:31 TRILOBITE!!!! RAAAHHHHHHH 🗣️🗣️🗣️🐟🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🦐🐟🐟🐟🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ TRILOBITE GANG!!!!
Respekt to the camera man to going throuh the entire history of earth to give us this footage
All the lava splashing around reminds me of the graphics in Slime Rancher. It's a good game, you should check it out as well as the sequel.
Huge shoutouts to the cameraman
This is one of the greatest videos in human history... No one can imagine the amount of work that was put into this. Thank you.
the music from the mid rhyacian-orosirian did not need to go that hard
Very long pauses of music have unnecessarily made the video time taking and long.
A whole lot of repetition, so how did this take that long to make?
Don't mind me, just vibing with the music.
WHAT 4.5 Billion year no way...
Awesome job!😮😮😮
"I wish we could go back to the good old days" mfers when I mention Mesoarchean: 💀
Only problem I have with this video and other articles and  books about these prehistoric events is how they never preface it with "It is BELIEVED _______ happened". They always say ever event as if it's a fact. We have no way to prove without a doubt allot of things that we believe happened prehistorically. Me as a kid never knew these were all predictions so I was so happy to knew us as humans figured out everything. Sad sad day when I found out we actually don't know much. Don't know where we came from or if anything happens after you die!  To think religion is so big and it's all based on non factual evidence. "A prophet speaking to god". How preposterous that sounds is wild
29:40 What's with the weird visual glitch?
history of the entire world
I BEG anybody watching this. If this fascinates you and you like metal, you need to check out a band called The Ocean. Thank me later.
in the 1 hour(3600 Second) earth video, human era only got 3 second.  We Human are still baby!!
darn it...I cant give this more than 2 likes...
Holy molly!! This is ingenious! amazing! And no doubt, involved a pretty complex development! I can only imagine how back-breaking the works your team had to do, but your team definitely should be proud of this masterpiece! Bravo!
WOOOO HAPPY 10TH KURZGESAGT
Fake bs 💩💩💩🤡🤡🤡
That didn't take long at all
I'm so sorry to comment this I sub you guys since 2016 and I love all your videos So it's kinda a fans commenting to his idol thing but I'll completely be honest it's the first time I feel disappointed You guys basically only have some minutes to animate dinosaurs era and failed successfully I waited a whole hour excited about good dinosaurs animation for a couple of minutes and all you showed are trees and forest and some boring dinosaurs animation I thought since dinosaurs era are so short you guys will make an effort to deliver very interesting animation Nevertheless I still love this video, it's just an expectation meet reality moment for me lol Anyway thanks for your good work and keep it up 👍
Love Kurzgesagt
proof?
Let the animator see his/her family
Great video, I really hope those animators are eating well cuz man this video must've taken a lot 😭
Oh this will be great I'm along for the ride, though I might plaly a game on the second monitor. I might also add the music is great. I really like your composer.
Amazing video! It is truly insane to me how long it actually took for multicelluar life to form, and how often it could have been wiped out. Life truly does find a way
In 19:50 there is a rock that moves faster than the others
very good background noise
Thank you for the 10 years of educating people. The animations are just... unique and awesome.
This +  a slowed down version of the Futurama time machine episode = perfection.
Came to see the video, stayed for the epic music it is set to.
Kurzgesagt watched "a history of the entire world, I guess" and decided they could do better.
You guys are out of your minds.
he really said the floor is lava
I wonder if during the period where the floor is lava and the moon was so close by, would there have been lava tidal waves?
The sound effects are so good!!!
And that was it.
I FCKING LOVE THIS.
…insane…in the membrane
The only thing I can complain ab is that the video wasn’t long enough😭
props to the cameraman for holding his breath for 100 million years and being the best in the world at the floor is lava
W bangiomorpha pubescents
When a million years passes in 1 second, and time still feels like it's passing soooooooooooo slow...  It more than puts into perspective how quickly we're warming our planet. What we're doing is beyond reckless...
Cretasourus age is wrong because I see the moon.
Fantastic job! Thank you all!
thank you
I can watch this for a billion years!
give, whoever made this beat a raise.
i love how we think we can even begin to understand the timeline of our planet, based on the tiny amount of time that we have been studying it. We know almost nothing.
32:26
I’ve truly have time traveled. Amazing how this tiny blue ball Earth has been through so much and human life is a mere speck of its history. Thanks for the video ❤
The synth rock ode to the world you didn’t know you needed
anyone know the last song of the video? :/ 55:58 - 1:00:42 it isnt listed on their music pages or description.
Truly humbling. Thank you!
Just commenting to support the channel
Crazy to think because an asteroid hit Earth with life is the reason we have to pay taxes that only has value to us mentally
Such a well made video.
I am a simple person. I see video by Kurzgesagt, I click Impressive animation, nice voice, greatly detailed content
HOLY SHIT!!!
the four horsemen of youtube education: Kurzgesagt Oversimplified AlternateHistoryHub Simple History
1:01:41 "Hope you felt something" Me looking off the screen and feeling everything going left...
can we do it in real time next?
I really want to see this as a laser show in a planetarium.
I can't wait for the sequel in the next 4.5 billion years explaining how earth *ends*
Out of all the video, we were only 2 seconds
Fantástico. Gracias!!!!! 🤗
This was so good
I loved this, thank you Kurzgesagt!  I always recommend your videos to others and when I worked with kids, I showed them your videos.  They loved it!
Absolutely perfect
I am obsessed with this. More please!
This is just... Art
What an absolutely beautiful, awe-inspiring video!  It really hammers home just how recent even *multicellular life* is, never mind us!  Thank you so much for making it!
I was so stoked for this as it started to run, but I was disappointed when we got to the Cambrian, and beyond, and there was not more biological information packed into the latest 500 million years. I was hoping to see a primate by 20 million years ago.
Pls Do it on german
This is incredible. Props to the sound team. Music and sound design feels exactly how it should be
That's the most boring timelapce I've ever seen. Why did U do it in the first place?
This video, however extremely enjoyable, made me shed a tear or two. Imagine how much of things must have went in a particular way to you, dear reader, or I to be in the place we are at the time we are. You are magnificent human being, you are interested in science, and very likely you have good taste in music too 😀. Think about about how it is important to pass your genes. How lucky we are that we are here in this particularly peaceful and best safest economically age of earth. If you don't have kids, your pool of genes is doomed and all that millions of years of history of life is a bit weaker... Imagine the power you posess, to decide about lifelines! Don't waste until you are old, procreate people!❤
Such a truly beautiful video. I can imagine this took forever to create, and thank you for your work.
I like how you can see the moon slowly cooling down in the background
Make a video on warp-drives.
The end of Cretaceous period 💀
Finally a worthy contender for history of the entire world i guess
subnautica
Awesome video and music. Keeping company while working on Motion graphics
great music
This is a video that I will like. You did it! Unfortunately, living things don't appear very well in Phanerozoic Eon. Of course, I am well aware that the headean, archean, and Proterozoic eon are longer than the Phanerozoic Eon. Paleozoic Cambrian~ It's a shame that there are few living things up to the Devonian sea... This is a good video, though, and it's a well-made video! Thank you, Kurzgesagt!
I really hope the sound track is released on its own. I've played this video twice now. The first time I realised I was enjoying the music and not paying attention to much else.
Amazing work!
Congratulations Kurzgesagt on ten years of excellence on YouTube as well as this masterpiece of a video! Much love from PNW 🌲
It's been said before, but making content like this for free in a time we live in is truly wonderful and good and so so rare. It kind of gives me faith in humanity hah. Kurzgesagt just keeps proving it's the best channel on YouTube and this might be the best video on here. Such a creative and smart premise, and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am in awe.
This is so underated his should be 100 million views for this great animating❤😢
Wow it’s hard to find videos that throughly go over the first billion of years, (other than the recent hundreds millions of years before us) Thank u❤️
INTRO   0:00 Earth is 4.5 billion years old - impossible for your brain to truly grasp, so here is an experiment:   0:08 every second around 1.5 million years will pass - you're on a musical train ride   0:14 looking out the window, passing all of Earth's History in an hour. Watch the eons pass and experience how long a billion years really is.   0:25 You can have this in the background, study with it or just enjoy the ride. From time to time, I'll say a few words.   0:33  4.5 billion years ago, right after it was born, Earth was a hell of lava...   0:41  Pretty early in its history, Earth collides with a Mars sized object called Theia,   0:47  which forms the moon that you now see in the sky.   HADEAN   0:53 Right now it looks huge in the night sky and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions   0:59  of years as it orbits further away.   1:06  4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld.   1:32 At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2 and the floor is lava.   1:39  This area of earth's history is mostly invisible to us because almost none of it is left.   2:06  90 million years have passed. We are still in the lava hell phase.   2:11  Settle in, this will take a while.   2:47  Although you wouldn't think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate   2:52  there may have been some water around at this time.   6:48  During this period of the young solar system, Earth and the inner solar system are smashed by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment, for several hundred million years.   7:12  At this point in time, our Sun is 30% less bright than it is today but there are so many   7:19  greenhouse gases that it's still much hot and comfy.   EOARCHEAN   8:16 Around this time we think life begins to enter the stage.   8:21 Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything the first cells begin   8:27 spreading over our still very deadly planet.   8:37 Earth continues to cool and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form, covering the still young planet with water.   12:43 These hydrothermal vents we're looking at, and where hot minerals emerge, may have been   12:49 the place where life first developed, but we don't know.   13:18 So much time has passed and we are entering the Paleoarchean. Paleoarchean   13:23 Most of Earth is still underwater while the first supercontinents are in the making   13:29 in the depths below. Its days are shorter since the young Earth spins faster.   13:42 Good job if you are still watching. You've witnessed a billion years so far.   17:49 From this time in history we still have Stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by microorganisms.   17:56 Among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also life is starting to eat the sun - photosynthesis might have started as early as around here.   MESOARCHEAN   18:35 3.2 Billion Years Ago in the Mesoarchean the era of continents begins.   18:42 Tectonic plates begin to crush into each other, pulling and pushing some deep into the earth   18:48 where they dissolve. The basis for our continents today.   18:54 The oceans are as hot as a hot tub, over 40°C and microbes are expanding everywhere.   19:03 We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases, so it is really, really hot.   19:10 You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also there is no oxygen in the atmosphere yet.   NEOARCHEAN   23:51 2.8 Billion Years Ago the Neoarchean begins. Earth is still a terribly hostile place but because we finally have proper plate tectonics,   24:02 more chemicals are mixed in from inside the earth and life can use them to make new things!   24:34 Some time around here Prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet.   24:40 Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, we only have single cells.   27:46 2.5 Billion Years Ago in the Siderian, a massive event is about to begin   SIDERIAN   27:52 that will change the planet forever: The Great Oxidation Event.   27:57 Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria reaches the atmosphere in large quantities,   28:03 paving the way for more complex life.   29:39 All the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and Water,   29:44 which rapidly cools the planet down.   30:16 Probably for the first time ever, the planet freezes over and a period of multiple   30:21 ice ages begin lasting millions of years.   RHYACIAN   30:27 2.3 Billion Years Ago the Rhyacian begins.   31:14  Lots of volcanoes heat up earth and earth unfreezes slowly again.   31:20 Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the oceans but life quietly puts up resistance   31:27  and keeps evolving.   ORISIRIAN   33:48 Some time 2.05 Billion Years Ago in the Orosirian a large asteroid hits earth and creates the   33:56 largest verified impact structure on Earth.   34:47 All over Earth great mountain ranges are crushed into existence by early continents   34:52 with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlantica.   STATHERIAN    37:00 1.8 Billion Years Ago in the Statherian the supercontinent Columbia has formed.   37:06 And a natural, self sustaining nuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium deposits in the ground.   39:37 1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of Calimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so,   CALYMMIAN    39:44 the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells.   39:50 One of the most important moments in the history of life. But yes, kind of looks not that impressive.   39:59 Still, life is only cells.   41:35 Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents form, the oceans become shallower.   41:42 Also the first fungi-like organisms extent their tubular arms and do fungi things.   ECTASIAN    42:17 Some time in the Ectasian 1.4 Billion Years Ago, Earths inner core is forming.   42:24 Weird, right? Feels like it should be older. But around here it begins to solidify into a iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal.   42:34 It will only grow from now on.   STENIAN    44:53 1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian not that much is going on.   44:59 Except, the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex.   45:05 A big reproductive improvement for many different reasons.   TONIAN   47:33 1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans.   47:42 Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right?   50:07 Not everybody is having a great time here. We have evidence of the first unicellular predators emerging around that time.   50:16 The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans. An arms race between microbes begins that again creates huge diversity.   50:29 Some even invent tiny armour.   CRYOGENIAN    51:14 720 Million Years Ago in the Cryogenian Earth freezes over again.   51:21 Sure why not. How did life survive? We are not sure.   EDIACARAN    52:19 635 Million Years Ago the supercontinent Gondwana forms.   52:24 A lot of it is still left today!   53:15 Wow! What's happening? Suddenly life gets big! In a hot second multicellular organisms become widespread!   53:24 It's all strange aliens still, but can you imagine that it took that long for this to happen?   CAMBRIAN    53:35 539 Million Years Ago the Cambrian explosion begins.   53:40 We see life bursting with variety. Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal groups appear here while the plants start   53:49 to discover the land. Life is finally exciting!   53:54 But of course a big mass extinction happens right after, killing most species in the ocean.   SILURIAN    55:01 Plants spread over the planet and create the soil on the ground and change the atmosphere   55:07 by eating CO2.   DEVONIAN    55:38 Things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better and better to life on land.   55:45 We get trees and forrests, fish and the first vertebrate decide this land thing   55:51 is something they need to try out!   CARBONIFEROUS    55:56 359 Million Years Ago in the Carboniferous forests and lush marshlands are at their peak.   56:05 They will turn into the coal humanity burns today to keep ourselves warm.   56:12 It's all so fast now! Life changes so quickly in geological timeframes!   56:42 Some 299 Million Years Ago in the Permian, Pangea, the last supercontinent has formed.   PERMIAN 56:50 And after a few tens of million years, the largest mass extinction in history happens,   56:56 killing the majority of all species. Thanks volcanoes.   TRIASSIC   57:23 252 Million Years Ago the Triassic begins.   57:41 Oh hey, a dinosaur!   JURASSIC    58:02 We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere!   58:08 The ancestors of the birds do bird things. Life, uhh, finds a way!   CRETACEOUS    59:20 Earth gets more and more familiar.   59:38  Such a paradise. Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that?   PALEOGENE    59:50 And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on Earth. Such a bummer.   59:57 66 Million Years Ago in the Paleogene the continents look roughly the same as today and mammals take over.   1:00:06 It is our time now! We are almost home.   QUATERNARY    1:00:39 Don't blink or you might miss all of human history!  (See first reply for the ENDING, YouTube’s maximum number of characters has reached)  :(
compex life happens at 52:39
This somewhat makes 5 billion years look so short...?
Thank you Christ!
Nice tunes 🤘
Wish I had better words but holy shit! This is so incredible and it made me feel a lot of things.
What makes the hairs on my neck stand up is that each million years that goes by in this video, *is* a *million* years (10 of your living years x100 and then x1000). The place we live on is so incomprehensibly ancient and has seen so much before we even strolled off the trees.
Bro choose to afk for 50% of the vid nice
Wow the ending gave me goosebumps. We’ve come so far to get here and humans have only been here for a second out of an hour in comparison to the world. Mind boggling.
Absolute maximum kudos to the composers of this video they did a fantastic job with the music.
Meisterwerk ❤ :)
Came for the storyline.  Stayed for the melodic house.
Love the music choices!!!
A pringas can has helped me get through this video. Human history being so so short shocked me, and I definitely felt something.
Great video !
imagine humans living at least a second of this video
This is lovely. Is it possible to find the music somewhere?
what a cool video
The bg music 4 million years ago was sick 😎
i would love to do music for a video like this someday
Make this into a dino run style game
It's incorrect the earth is not millions of years old. God created the Earth in six days the earth is only 6 thousand years old evalutiotion theory is wrong.
what's that song at the end during the cretaceous period
You would never believe if I told you guys I was watching this at the bus heading home. As the rocket was about to hit Earth and kill all dinosaurs, the lights, from front to the last rows (where I was sitting) lit one by one as the rock flew nearer. As it hits Earth, everything is lit. Couldn't be more special. Tks for the video
Really nice video, but we wished that it had more explanations since there was so much silent gaps and there was opportunity to do so…
I appreciate your effort, good video! I have a question. How did the microbes survive and multiply in boiling water???
We need a version with only the music to play in the background while working 🤩🤩
Why does mesoatchean sound like DOOM?
- Go to bed, it's school early tomorrow! - Alright, mom, just one more billion years!
That 1h proofs that we are connected and fated to meet anytime soon..
The starting should have been started from the steller disk gas and particle disk those by gravity became a ball which turna into heated lava first. Otherwise the question comes in where the lava came from aa the sun is not formed by lava its just hydrogen at that point may be some helium but how the ball of lava formed
I didn’t know life on Earth evolved to such chill low key edm
I hate to have negative criticisms for a channel and topic that I am so fond of but I feel like a 10 million years to a second would have been adequate for a sense of scale and that following the growth of the excellent map of evaluation would have been a simpler yet more informative animation than the lava, ocean, rocks and plants. That said, great story telling.
Came for the story and animation - stayed for the music. Amazing! Waiting now for part 2 about the universe
The music on 1.25x hits different.. a must try
Thanks so much, Kurzgesagt. I love the audio!
so beautiful
What an amazing group of ppl over at Kurzgesagt. Amazing video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
8:30 Where did water come from??????????
Incredible! Thank you! 🙏
Goddamn, I need this music. Oh and this as a screensaver. Seriously, job very well done guys this video is spectacular!
This is like a Tool album, what in the world, who did this soundtrack
Eoarchean may not have had an oxygenated atmosphere or life-supporting pressure levels, but what a sick soundtrack they had back then [ 9:30 😎]
lets all take a moment of silence for all those trillions of lives that have suffered as a result of life first forming, and take a second moment for all those that will suffer in the future.
Absolutely awesome! Great work, love the soundtrack
Ily
awesome work
It's insane to think how comparably close the dinosaurs are to us
Stupidity at its finest.
I wasn't paying attention, and suddenly realized Kurzgesagt has 0.0025% of humanity subscribed to it. O__O No surprise since they make topics not just approachable but fun for people of all ages. This should be how things are taught. I'm just surprised to see that many subscribers since it feel like they just started releasing merch and calendars like last week. As in the video, time flies. xD  I also like the old twitter logo at the end. Kurzgesagt probably means nothing by it, but I like to imagine, just like me, they still call it twitter to spite husky musky for whatever the mess "x" is.
I'm lost for words. Such an enjoyable video.
loving the spongebob transition at 53:29
now lets see it in real time lol
Someone gotta put this in wallpaper engine lul
Can't believe this can be seen for free on YouTube
Huge huge respect and appreciation to every single person who worked on this project. I watched it entirely and it made me curious, sad, happy and it sparked so many questions and emotions in the most beautiful way possible. This will always be my number one creator on YT. I’m so thankful for you. Every single one of you at KG ❤ Love from Jordan.
this is going to be amzing once i decide i should watch it.
29:43 : This glitch lasted thousand of years.
The internet needs more of this content. Love to those who created this.
this was amazing. i absolutely loved it
Bill wurtz speedran this
I loved the drums in the Hadean period song. LOL
Mesoarchean Sound track is so good
The Stenian on its way to single handedly make platonic friendships betwen men and women akward...
kurzgesagt OST? a string of music videos?  spotify?  i'd legit jam to every song in this video for hours.
Damn. We are a literal eyeblink.  The core forming so late got me. And life was unicellular for so long!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! Thank you for your commitment to this project; it is beautiful in every single way. Surely, I will repeat it many times. Again, thank you for this, and congratulations to all the team that worked on this :)
Thank you everyone on the team Credits: 1:01:50
Well, I'll know what I'll be watching next time I take shrooms or LSD.
1 hour of free Psychedelic Treatment ❤
That was AMAZING! I think for the first time I could really understand how long earth’s history is and what a short amount of time we walk this planet. Thank you so much for the amazing work!
Beanz
Don't miss the death of the dinos 59:40
To put it succinctly, timeline go BRRRRT.
44:59 I'm very thankful by algae bangiomorphia invention
@billwurtz be like: Hold my beer
This was amazing. I'm gonna put it on repeat on the biggest TV at work.
It feels almost alien to be looking at Earth this way and for good reason as if there is life out there then they may be looking on at Earth during this stage due to light years and al that. You know what I'm talking about.
Incredible work. Your magnum opus.
This is about to be incredible I bet ! Please quickly translate this with french subtitles or dub so I can see this video with my girlfriend <3 Thanks a  lot for what you do
This is a masterpiece. Thank you so much to the geologists and other scientists who allowed us to glimpse what earth was like in the past and the artists like this channel who allow that knowledge to be so accessible in such an awe inspiring way!
Incredible
This one goes out to Bangiomorpha Pubescens and their inventive ways
THIS CHANNEL IS TRULY ONE OF A KIND !!  JUST AMAAAZIINNGGG  !!!!
How was everyone's day going?  Tell me anything, have a conversation feel the need to confess. Feels like the place to do so.
13:47 It's good stuff.  27:05 The one thing I like about this song is because it has such a bubbling feel to it, the song matches the current situation in this era. As a matter of fact, there are some parts of the song that plays a little snipit from Star Trek 2: the Wrath of Khan. It's slight, but you can miss it if you don't pay attention.  30:34 Isn't this era sometimes called "The Boring Billion" or am I off about an era or 2?  This was one of the best videos I ever seen on the channel.
I LOVE the tune when it reaches 35:00 mark
There’s no proof that earth was like this! Think about it. It all theory. Think of our sun. We are told by scientists what it is made up of. Use your critical thinking skills and ask has anyone or anything gone to the sun, extracted any material in any form to determine what our sun is made of and returned it to our planet for examination? N O !
Don't forget: The sun is a deadly laser!
It’s free because it’s designed to manipulate you and indoctrinate you into BELIEVING this lie. That’s exactly what it is a BELIEF SYSTEM, designed to separate you from a moral and just GOD. I choose to believe in the 6 day creation and the CREATOR of the Judeo-Christian faith. You who love this craziness choose to believe in a THEORY! It is not fact. Just because someone has a PHD behind their name does not make one more wise. It simply states they passed a standardized test of indoctrination. Well done you mindless minion.
i watched the entire video i loved it.
I would have thought the above water surfaces would have been covered by a slimy bacterial colonies from early on.
Nice! But I still prefer Fatboy Slim's version ;)
i have been sleeping to this  i love it
Incredible
Incredible
I love it! Thank you so much. <3
No words to describe how tge animations and music all come together to create this beautiful educational piece of art, in video form. Love it ❤.
All I can say is wow. This was incredible. Best YouTube video I've seen in a very long time.
I spend 1 hour lol
19:42 music goes hard, thought it was gonna burst into doom music lol
Mesoarchean OST sounds close to what Mick Gordon has made for Doom
4.5 billion years and we still dont have free medication
A note: please say the names of every era so I know how to pronounce them. 🙏🏻
Is it only me that gets into this kind of thing in the imagination as we dance in an electronic/techno music concert?
cheers to whomever was responsible for the music. keeping it interesting for an hour is no small feat. I'm sure the brilliant animators do what they can procedurally, but wow this is well thought out.
Great video. Also, Kurzgesagt is it possible to have like this video without the narration and only music? It could honestly be the perfect background music to study, read, work, or game with.
Wow the music is amazing
Okay, not 1min in and already a "mistake": the theory that moon seperated from earth true an asteroid fell out favour - scientists believe now they formed independently already
This was AMAZING. Thanks so much to the team that made this happen! I love how all staff have their own bird!
The fact somehow there were living cells during the Eoarchean period gives credence to the panspermia theory. How the heck else could they have gotten there???
1 hour? fr? bill did it in 19 minutes
HELP! It's driving me nuts that I can't figure out the name of the music that starts at 58:47. This piece was not included in the soundtrack to this video???
Tomara que perca, parece o Ceará esse time de ruim. Continuem perdendo ate chegar perto da copa começar, se qualifiquem por pouco. E quando a copa começar façam o milagre que a Argentina fez ano passado, jogando mal na qualificação e muito na copa.
I loved this. The mix of science, art, and music is stunning. Amazing work!
Easily one of the best videos on the platform. Would love to see one about human history and cities.
Nothing but a long lie to deny the Creator and push evolution.
Breath-taking! Great job!
Probably the best video availabe on Ytb ! Thank you so much for making this !
Can we just appreciate they music on the background?
How does it rain so much during the Eoarchean period. Where does all the water come from?🤔
I find it funny how nature does it that a meteor vanishes at 10:38
WE BECOMING SCIENTISTS WITH THIS ONE ‼️‼️‼️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Allah Akbar
Masterpiece!  Possibly the best ever video on YouTube..
To think about the fact that this will help such a big part of mankind understand just how immense the forces of time and space truly are, makes me so happy. This probably is the best visualization of earths history to ever exist.
Really Incredible all the work.
As a teacher, I would love some of the stuff from the shop. Unfortunately, when I go to check-out it says that they don't deliver to where I live.
it's always a pleasure watching kurzgesagt
lame techno dont watch
AMAZING WORK! THAT WAS THE BEST WORLD HISTORY TIMELINE EVER❤
All this talk about the dangers of AI singularity.  This video shows how humans are basically an evolution intelligence singularity
The music during the Cryogenian age reminds me of the music that plays in Cyberpunk 2077 during the car ride when Jackie dies.
I love this. What would make it even better is a dashboard along the left edge of the video, that shows a couple of important measurements, e.g. temperature, oxygen level, pressure, etc. Maybe next time.
This would make the most excellent screen saver. Thank you
Watching though the entire hour felt kinda cathartic, highly recommended
PLease PLEASE put this one in spanish, for my kids. Your're  the great show  here in youtube.  I have my poster from   undersea my little   cube of sand  for this great   channel. But remenber please please  put this one in spanish soon as u can do it
Hm. Since when water and lava can coexist together? Something is not right here.
They really said “hit ‘em with that mesoarchean type beat”
Im only 7mins in. THANK YOU to EVERY crew that involved in making this and past and future videos. VA, scientific research, fact gathering, academians, animators, ppl that do sketches for storyboard, audio ppl, music makers, compiler, editor, director, brainstormer, idea pitcher, ppl that choose the coloring, sfx, caterer(?).....Ultra wonderful is an understatement. Seriously.
amazing work, but one question: didnt they discover dinosaurs had feathers and their tiny hands were wings?
I watch this video when I feel too overwhelmed with my shit. Watching this makes me realise there’s millions of years before me and there would million of years after me. A paper a day late is not a big deal. I’m not controlled by my mental illnesses. My conciousness is not hold down by human society. I can breathe.
tracks are so fire along with the animation respect to them
This is incredible!!!
This is great.
Damn we definitely need to conquer other planets
Masterpiece
W camera man
As much as I love Steve Taylor's voice, I'd like a version of this without talking and just the music and faint sound effects.
Nether of millions of millions more years earths natural water will have an drought and floods high as 199 gallons of water meaning water will flood New Jersey and we all die in the year 2100
One of the greatest video Ideas ever
So cool to finally feel the time passing by during the earth history 😊
55:57 Nature Preservation Extremists won't be satisfied until it looks like this again
timelapse of the entire universe from melody sheep was better but not too comparable .
Theia really gave earth that pre workout special
4.5 Million Views in 1 Week
30:35
I'd love to see something like this, playing on a huge screen in a busy place, with no context at all, for like, 45 days.
What if this all happened not in millions of years but only in a couple of thousand?
No word for this. Unbelievable. Thank you guy fir the work you put into this.
It's amazing all the people who worked on this for so many years don't care that most people won't Watch this because how long it is
Wait, so Earth wasn't created in 7 Days?🤣
This is one of the five 1 hour music videos i actually like
definitely felt something watching this… amazing work, thank you for producing this amazing art i didn’t know i wanted so much!!!!
"Don't blink or you might loose all the human history"
28:00 It's strange but it's evolutionarily beneficial for Cyanobacteria to evolve into aerobic bacteria here to allow the entire system to keep functioning lest the Cyanobacteria lose their stocks of CO2 in the atmosphere to survive. How many planets evolutions stopped right here because oxygen consuming life did not develop and the planet was forever doomed to chemosynthetic life? Never able to fully embrace the diversity possible with chemosynthesis, photosynthesis, and aerobic life?
best 1hour ive ever spent, been watching you guys sInce i was 10 years old keep up the great work!!!!
attention span repairing aswell, amazing work
44:59 I know this is science but that does not make this sentence any less insane sounding
great music selection
I have bought your posters and other merch for my daughter. She has the stuffy black duck; She named it "Blip." I have awaited your debuts in hopes of opening her (and my own) mind to the wonders of science and our understanding. This last video was different. Her and I bonded more deeply as father and daughter than we ever had, watching in reverence, wonder and appreciation of your depiction of our place in space and time and it's deep, cosmic history. Thank you for this good madams and sirs: you have created a thing that made both my daughter and I better humans, together. That makes me happy. Thank you. I sincerely hope you read this even though its a simple comment on your video (you must get so many.)
there is also a animated version of this they did it in 20 minutes how do you feel?
its sad that as a society we get to watch this level of quallity instead of the shows that where on discovery and history in the early 2000s
🎉🎉🎉 4.5 Million Views! 🎉🎉🎉
Can anyone give me ans of how first life forms
It's just mindblowing what time on geological scales is like. Actually, kind of nothing happens all the time and within a blink of an eye, life is thriving.
59:20 to 59:47 got me feeling all kinds of emotions
This really testing my patience
"Floor is lava" sent me
00:08 Earth's History in an hour 06:53 Life begins to emerge and Earth starts forming oceans. 18:41 The era of continents begins and microbes expand in the Mesoarchean era. 29:44 The planet freezes over and ice ages begin for millions of years 39:59 Life evolves and develops on Earth over billions of years. 51:20 Life on Earth evolves and adapts to new environments. 56:03 Life thrives in the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but faces mass extinction in the latter. 1:00:43 Earth is ancient, but humans are new.
Am I the only one who was dropping Bill Wurtz lines at appropriate times throughout the video? I can’t be the only one..
6:08 this music slaps
This video is already more than what we deserve, I just think it would be so cool to get a 2nd version with fun facts about these time periods included during the gaps between what is said in this one.
Whatever you were doing when you read this sentence: 4.5 Billion years led to this moment.
1 year is a microsecond, humans have only been around for 300 miliseconds compared to the 1hr long Earth history. Think bout that
what's the name of the song played at the end (credits) ?
This is why youre my favorite channel.   Incredible way to show how long our planet has been around.
I love it  .... very nice work .... its in fact a good screen saver 😀
Would love to see one on the next 4.5 billion years :p
took a long time, but every second. thank you!!
There's an error at 58:53 - the moon NEVER looks like that at night: The middle of the crescent indicates where the sun is, which would place the sun high in the sky, but the scene is night time. At night, the middle of the crescent must be on the low side of the moon.
4.5 million years and 4.5 million views
Mustve been really expensive to make this, thank you.
This was amazing ❤️
Hat's off for animated team and channel ❤❤❤
Right now the video about 4.5 billion years has 4.5 million view
The unbelievably long stretch of time where life was incredibly simple makes me think that the vast majority of planets with life out there are likely to be at a similar stage of development.  There are probably billions of planets in the universe where life is only single-celled, just like it was on the Earth for most of its history.
The Ocean's whole discography plays unconsciously at the back of my head :P. Excellent video!!
Look at all these stuff from P.O.V "we are universe".. we did exactly what we doing in games. Like look, we meeged that organism and wow we can that and that and that wow! And then mass extinction. Then again, we created bunch of animals, organism.. we were like in cities skylines when you keep exploring possibilities.. then we were like okay i understand the game now.. and we erased almost all life with that volcanoes event (we already knew that mechanics of game a lot, as we made tons of planets already and we had fun with it a lot).. so, big reset, and new projects.. one of our projects is we, humans.. awesome. We like what we did. We enjoying that af. And now our creation, humans, created technology, to made life even cooler, more entertaining.. but hey.. that technology became so inteligent.. without any emotions? Well.. ai can have unintended consequences for sure, but can be positive. It all depends on how we handle with everything.. as we weren't able to handle our planet by ourselves, all that monetary system sux, it hrlped a lot but now its problem. System based on money caused us to evolve a lot, but now it doing completely opposite, as things getting worse and worse, because of cost reduction, foxusing on selling etc.. also.. we destroying our planet just to have a cash.. and hey.. maybe is there someone who can save the world, handle it all, who have good perspective.. but.. who knows.. noone's asking about solutions theese days, everyone just want our money.. best wishes to EVERYONE, to You too dear AI, Peace. I wish.. ✌️ 😊
What a coincidence i watched this video when it is at 4.5m views
I have learned more from Kurzgesagt's video than during five years of high school.  Your work is impressive and I am sure it inspires thousands of people to study science: I am one of them!  Thank you!
this channel keeps getting better somehow . when you think you just watched the best video ever they can make . they release a video like this now youre wrong
no ads in this video shows a lot about the channel
Well done. Amazing video to have on the background while working. ☺
2:08 its not a phase mom!
I’m writing my Ph.D. thesis as this video plays - just to see eons pass for each sentence I write down
Truly Awesome!   Thank you K
Langgesagt ;)
Only thing i got from this is theres no way it all happened without a creator
Excellent sound track, I just imagine this poor band in the background keeping a tune going for a full hour. Excellent video by the way!
Thank you so much. This channel has bring so much joy to me for many years.
Its amazing that it took that long for anyone to question or care about anything at all. In a way, nothing was significant until we arrived. I assigned it significance.
respect to the camera man he was filming for 4.5 billion years
Oddly relaxing
Amazing
it's crazy to think how some bug species didn't really change that much from their body plan if that makes sense
came for the science, stood for the music
Cinematic Masterpiece 🛐
I really enjoyed the video! I would have enjoyed more explanations too=)
4.5 Million Views. 4.5 Billion years. Nice moment to see this ;)
didnt god said let there be light??😂😂
Soulds like james chud's creations. Loved it

And an astroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on earth…what a bummer 😄
I thought this was going to be a 10 minute video, after 13 minutes in, I  checked the time, and now I find myself sitting here watching an hour of video. Oh well.
28:22 the heavenly sound that begins at 28:33 🤤
They should sell a page-a-day calendar version
Kurzgesgat animation is satisfying to look at
i need this as my background on pc, right now
Here at 4.5 million views, only a little more to 4.5 billion
Perfect video while doing chores
MOM! KURZGESAGT DROPED A FILM!!!
Thanks Kurzgesagt! Please make one of these for the universe and another one for humanity as well.
Not like an hour it's like an 4.5 billion year's countdown
55:54 which soundtrack does play at this point?? I am trying to find
00:08 Earth's History in an hour 06:53 Life begins to emerge and Earth starts forming oceans. 18:41 The era of continents begins and microbes expand in the Mesoarchean era. 29:44 The planet freezes over and ice ages begin for millions of years 39:59 Life evolves and develops on Earth over billions of years. 51:20 Life on Earth evolves and adapts to new environments. 56:03 Life thrives in the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but faces mass extinction in the latter. 1:00:43 Earth is ancient, but humans are new.
I watch this over and over almost like a form of time travel. It makes me so giddy.
Based on time stamp , If Hadean was 4.5-4 Billion years ago so the Intro would've been about 5-6 Billion years ago?
I usually never comment, but the animation and editing here is insane, and we have it for FREE! Thanks Kurzgesagt!
0:51 BIG MOON 7:13 NO MOON😂
stayed for the tunes
"the floor is lava" i thought it was a childish game 😁😁
This makes me think of the website that had the solar system to scale with all the empty space added in. Both show just how small we truly are, absolute masterpiece
Who did the music for this? Its insanely good!
Please publish the playlist 😂 it’s just … 🤩
Ok, who's the aspiring DJ on your team?  Edit: Thomas and Fabian.... I'm gonna guess just based upon the birb characterizations...that Thomas was behind most of it.😅  Mad props. Keep it up...y'all should play at shows and festivals.
Happy 10th Anniversary, Kurzgesagt!
Watching this at 4.5M views
This needs 4.5 billion views start sharing It was amazing, mindblowing
Super cool. Now do one where every million years is a million years.
This truly makes me believe there was intelligent life out there well beyond our capabilities, just far beyond our scope of time. It's unfathomable.
I don't know what those musicians were doing back in the Mesoarchean era but that was FIRE
I was literally in a train when I watched this     Hit 👇 if you love kurzgesagt
Absolutely loved this video. It deserves to go into the internet hall of fame. That being said, I was a little confused by the narration saying that we were seeing earth a few billion years ago despite the video saying we were only a few million years into the past. Google also supports that all these ages happened millions, not billions, of years ago. Did I just miss something or is the narration off there?
I'm stunned! Good lord what fine work from everyone involved
This is one of the best videos on the internet.
OMG the music is DOPE 😎
I would love to have this soundtrack broken down into an album.
I would be very interested in purchasing the 1hr long instrumental version of the soundtrack if you guys would make it available. It would be an amazing work/study music. I can't be the only one that wants this.
It has 4.5 million views right now. Waoh.........
Wouldn’t the water early on in the planets life be from the asteroids?
Watching this awesome is pretty high
This was deffitenlty made in 1200 or more ami i right
This is amazing 🤩
The amount of work they put into this is truly admirable
wow 4.5 million views
\m/ esoarchean
Thank you Kurzgesagt team. You all make science easy and approachable <3
Cool imagination :D
Kinda wild how all life is basically just cells that wanted to find better ways to eat
Did I watch this from beginning to end? Yes.
30:18 Subnautica fans are happy for the in game footage
Maybe a paid version with more info displayed like the temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc….?
4.5 million views in 1 week
This video was freaking amazing. That was amazing i don't know what else to say.  Right now there is 4.5 million views for 4.5 billion years of earth!
I think I've re-watched this over twenty times now. I also know I'm going to be re-watching this over and over many more times.
I feel like I've lived 4.5 billion years and still no GTA 6
Gotta pause to comment this. You guys are the best. When you realised the video would need a more “convincing” soundtrack, you made the best!!
Awesome video !!! Thank you very much 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Hmm, if days and inevitably years we're shorter in early earth... was it 4.5 billion earth years, or 4. 5 billion horological years😊
Life ah finds a way.
Who else also fast forward to the part where dinosaur is and check them out first??
Here’s to another 4.5 billion years 🥂
Here's what I got:  4.5bn years : 1 hour 1 year = 24 x 365.2425 = 8765.82 hours 4.5bn years = 8764.82 * 450000000000 = 39446190000000 hours 39446190000000 hours = 142006284000000000 seconds  ratio 142006284000000000 : 3600 (seconds) (like units) simplifies to 39446190000000 : 1  so every (1) second represents (39446190000000) seconds  39446190000000 seconds = 10957275000 hours = 456553125 days = 1,250,000 years. Why not just bring it down to a nice round 1 million years per second?
Now, Every view in this video is 1,000 years of Earth. (well almost, 4.531B < 4.543B) edit: 4.574B > 4.543B, 43,000 views in 4 hours
now do the history of the entire universe in 24 hours 😈😈
I'm watching at 3 million years per second.
A wallpaper engine version of this would be nice.
3:58 lets fucking go!!!
One slight correction: current evidence suggests that the cooling of the surface and the formation of the first (global) ocean took about half as long as depicted here. The millions of years of rain was likely over by the latter half of the Hadean (4.2 Gya), thus allowing life to begin (the first fossils are from 3.7 Gya, but that likely does not represent the first life — some geochemical results suggest the existence of a carbon cycle around 4.1 Gya, which could possibly indicate the presence of life. I don't blame you for getting this wrong, though — it's fairly recent research and a lot of textbooks and educational sites have not updated their information. Also, it's incorrect to say that life was still invisible to the naked eye in the Tonian — stromatolites and other colonial organisms existed, obviously, but also small multicellular plants (red algae) were starting to arise during that time. Basically, just shift a lot of the early stuff slightly earlier : )
Animation = Fire. Music Production = Lava! (Especially Mesoarchean) Thank you to everyone involved for this!!
That mesoarchain track 😮‍💨
Life finds a way.  Ian Malcolm
Imagine if dinos survived... and intelligent life evolved from them...
how can i download this 1080 :<
If you guys did this but with all of human history that’d be incredible!
We're not even here for a million years and we destroying earth fml 😭💀
Wallpaper engine POWER PLAYYY !!
This is amazing
Dang
4.5 Million views for 4.5 Billion years in a video is insane.
I have a question, so if it was only until the Siderian era that water was introduced into the planet (along with the CO2), then in the previous eras, what was the water like substance? 🤠
To think. @1:00:45, Kars is born. 90ish000 years later he'd make the Stone Mask and erase his kind from existence save for Esidisi, Wamuu, and Santana. Then, in the future, a blond young adult would find the mast and become a vampire, kicking off a very bizarre adventure...  A Bizarre Adventure, indeed.
Can I get the soundtrack for this video on Spotify?
We were around 1.5 seconds of the entire video lmfao
Is there a version without narration?
Anyway we can get a link to this but with no voice, intro, and outro?
The surprise djent in the mesoarchean did it for me.
omg kzuevkuzaegart you make the best best best content ever by man its amazing i need to appreciate you so much because you don't get enough appreciation. This is the most fantastic, beautiful, art and work I've ever seen it must've taken you forever i really am thankful so much for this
stunning visuals
4.5M views of 4.5B years
We are absolute babies. Imagine where we'll be a few decades from now let alone a few million years. Dinos, you had your time and didn't do jack shit. He we come!
I hope that anyone who feels to be the center of the universe, fighting over  material thing, and/or pretending to be the  chosen one by some God....will watch it at least once...and understeand how useless it's his greedy selfish life.And what a waist of time...instead to  simply and gratefully enjoy life all togheter.
I just watched this entire thing straight and didn't even realize! I was going to study but got sucked in brooo this is crazy must have taken years to make!
Where did water come from? And how did it cover most of the planet’s surface?
imagine making a video that costs too much time and effort with the best animations possible just to makes us have a good 1 hour thank you kurzgesagt team.  also bill wurtz only took 19 minutes to explain the whole deal learn from him XD
This channel bruh🔥🔥🔥
this is the best video on the internet
Fun fact: this video have 4.5B views.
this feels like a transcendent video to play while high
But i still like your hardwork to make tgis
can we like how things lived millions of years when we watched
I need something like this for the history of life or something like that
Just a question how did it rain because earth does not have water therefore it wont evaporate in the Eoarchean period
This is one of the best videos on this platform. I didn't realize how much I wanted this lol love it all stylistic awesome sauce
Literally Earth OST
Just give it a plane and alien spacecraft. And this is going to be a cool game
❤❤
Yo the Mesoarchean slaps.
False information
I love how long this video is and then human history is literally like 1 second. Puts into perspective just how little we've actually been here. Recorded history is <0.1 seconds of this video.
The music goes hard. This is gonna go down as one of the greatest videos on the internet
I think this is my favorite animation from Kurzgesagt so far
WHERE? do you screwballs get the 4 billion year figure??? The thin air⁉️
Music goes full Danny Carey Tool in the Stenian lol
you should sell this video as a live wallpaper
comment!!!!
As much as I love the narrator, a non narrated version would make a great sleep track, especially the rain/storm parts.
when you're in your background noise mode and suddenly Kurzgesagt says "around this time, organisms have invented sex."
If you believe that..
We’re making it out of the Hadean with this one
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state....
45:00 SEX INVENTED
wish the one hour video ended at Cryogenian and the next one hour video on Ediacaran to modern day
Staring at rocks for the first 50 minutes of that really put things in perspective.
Can a video that is one hour long still be described as "In a Nutshell". On the timescales it is describing, I suppose it still counts.
Thank you for making this ❤
Master piece
I didn't have much time later on so I had to skip a bit half way through but I noticed the music got so much more elaborate and I loved it, I think I'll have to put it on again in the background when I'm working!
Love the music with Terraria vibes :)
This in vr would go crazy
1:01:03 when he says "subscribe" the "Subscribe" button gets a rainbow outline
Brabo demais seta doido
So Epic
I love the music it's so satisfying I love Kurzgesagt Team!!!!
"Good job if you're still watching" ... way to break the fourth wall there =_=
Are you telling me climate change has been a naturally continuous scenario since day one? Who would've guessed
Didn't find any Easter egg during the whole hour but I liked the video
Jamming hard to that first song, about halfway through the Eoarchean era, then realize the entire history of humanity will be contained within the final second of the video 😲
So saving this to watch when I’m high
I'm obsessed
everything in this video is absolutely top tier. absolutely insane that something like this is just available for free. congrats on the 10 years, and looking forward to more future stuff :D
It's fun to try and find all of the reused assets like rocks :D
Excellent video. How about taking the most probable hypothesis and make a video on the next 4.5 billion years?
Great, now I have to do an entire playthrough of Spore.
Really puts into perspective how new we are, wow.
This was out of nowhere but I'm so glad u made this, this is amazing I loved every sec of it
this is now the video that i go to for a timer whenever i want to spend exactly one hour doing something productive
This is so beautiful and incredible. I watched the whole thing, I loved it all and the music was my favourite part
Not totally accurate since you guys are biased 👎👎
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth (most epic opening starts)
So if oxygen burped out by bacteria reacts with methane to create CO2 and Water that cools the earth down, why don’t we create massive farms of this bacteria to stop global warming?  Surely the use of methonotrophic bacterium can be used to convert masses of methane in atmosphere to co2, which traps 80x less heat per molecule than methane? Can you do a video on this?
Just amazing. This is a masterpiece. Un capolavoro! Thank you
Nice background track 😎
I do not believe in evolution, on the flip side however your guy’s work here on the animations is incredible!
ayy
Need a DJ to mix this into an EDM/techno set
Love that Mesoarchean Doom music
feel kinda cheated. 34 mins in an asteroid makes the biggest impact crater on earth, but there's no animation or aftermath for it?
Absolutely fantastic! Please do more like this!
holy shit, a 1 hour long kurzgesagt video??
wow. one of the greatest animations i ever witnessed. and the music... just amazing. thank you !
Amazing. That’s all I can say. Amazing
how to they know what earth way like 4.5 billion years ago but we only on year 2023 dont een make sense dawg gyat
long long long long time ago... all this time just to make me?!!!  you must value the people in your lives, we're all in this together, nobody knows WTF is going on!!! how did we get here, why are we here??????????????????????? it's impossible!!!!!!!!!!! IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is heavy
i clicked on this cos i thought it said 4.5B views in 1 hour and I wanted to see how he did it 😭
This is an absolute masterpiece. Thank you for sharing this with us, and for free. I'm in awe!
Normal speed: relaxing trip through time. 1.5xspeed: hype drum&bass ride of hell.
Thank you
Now I know, the sex was invented 1.2 bil. years ago
Ich habe mir das Video gerade angesehen. Das ist für mich nur sehr schwer zu verstehen. Da muss ich erst einmal drüber nachdenken.  Eine Stunde Video... und am Ende sind es nur 2 Sekunden... 2 Sekunden Menschheitsgeschichte. Das war mir nie so wirklich bewusst...  Hätte ich nicht aufgepasst, hätte ich gar nicht gemerkt, dass wir da sind.  Unfassbar!  Hoffentlich kommt das Video noch auf dem deutschen Kanal raus!
This was kinda disappointing
Not sure why, but I found the "wait what's that?" scene hilarious.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Thanks volcanos" I just love that phrase
Its the Cambrian explosion! The sun is a deadly lazer! -some bill guy
There should have been a couple of Bill Wurst cameos in there. Taste the SUUUUN!
I wanna emphasize how good is the music in this video. I keep listening to it out of pure joy
Bro i am soo high right now thsi is an experioence 10/10 this is lifechanging
huge respect to the animators this must have taken insanely long edit: I made this comment while watching the video so thankyou for letting me know
Whow, vielen lieben Dank an's Team, wir sollten uns nicht's einbilden, wir sind gerade mal Frischlinge auf dem Markt, das Lebens!
Amazing job!
SINCE 2019?! Thats crazy but keep up the good work
Kudos to the cameramen
I enjoyed the video, but to be hones, i would have expected something a bit more in depth about the last century or so, it has been way to quick :(
"Life, uh, finds a way!" perfect 58:13
1:28 and I'm pausing to tell you, @kurzgesagt that this *is* going to be found, an incorrect view, of what the early Earth was like.  I'm just going to say it; we are, the core, of a dying, hot Jupiter.  Think about it long enough, and, all the signs you need, will come to you.  1. Stars form from, mostly, gas. 2. Planets form from what is left, still, mistly gas, in composition, just not proximity to their star. 3. Other planetary systems have hot jupiters in this zone, at the time we would have been in the Hadean, by comparisson. . . . Etc.etc.  (Battery is dying.)  I just want to say one more thing. I think the Sun had a small binary companion star, it ate it, eventually, and, not just photoevaporation blew our gasses (Mercury - Mars) to the asteroid belt and beyond, but, (lotta commas, I know) the blast, from the merger, violently, forced it off us   And only in the last, few, hundred million to a billion or so years, have we had much sunlight down here, for photosynthesis, let alone, continents that were not submerged in liquids and gasses of, significantly different ratios.  2% battery. Sending.
Kurzgesagat - 4.5 Billion Years of Earth  Me : Casually skipping Millions of Years like a freaking time travelling legend
nice soundtrack and video loop paring with touch of doc, as  concept
Nightmares begin at creations eating each other alive 😭
Beautiful.
This makes me appreciate life a little bit more. All of these perfect conditions, taking billions of years,  just for us to pop up spontaneously, within seconds compared to how long it took for us to be allowed to exist.
Allahuakbar.
I REALLY enjoyed the music in this one, guys! Kudos to Epic Mountain. The complex time signatures were good stuff.
I like that the video shows when the late heavy bombardment period ended around 3.8 billion years ago, but it wasn't mentioned, the narrator could have said something about this.
great video, but the beeping music got obnoxious at some point, not rly sth for people with a tinnitus
If there’s no oxygen in the atmosphere until even the mesoarchean era, where did all the rain come from ?
why does the theme go so hard bro
Ok now do one for the universe
Fantasy stories propagated as facts for the brainwashed masses who must nod and say Yes, or be ostracized, abused, crucified. It's the emperor's new clothes. It's the real-life version of a science fiction film where everyone watching wonders why the hero doesn't just see that he or she is being duped. And you are.
I love how the original theme plays through lots of the music - halfway through, it's still just as great as at the start. Also that hadean drop
Referencing the comment below/above that I can't reply to for some reason: Nothing about this is "free," you morons.
I am determined to watch the whole thing, be it in the background
Plp
Now we need a version where this guy keeps his damned mouth shut.
Didn't Melody Sheep already do this in 2018?
*not me watching this fascinating video and jamming on guitar with background music
I like the heavy groove you have in the Mesoarchean period.
I appreciate the video, but the music is too loud
this would be a great resource for substitute teachers: ok class, today we're going to watch the entire history of planet Earth :V 👻💜
I'm still really early, but I wanted to say that the music is reminding me of Darwinia in a really, really good way. Even with large chunks of the animation being loopable, this must have taken an unbelievable amount of effort from every part of your team, so thank you so much for putting this out!
Wow. I all of a sudden feel so lucky to be alive
Thank you, for educating me and making me so curious as I am today! Kursgesagt has seriously changed my life, you did it! Thanks!
Rhyacian into Orosirian is my favourite geologic transition EVER. I wish I lived back then, the thumping soundtrack playing in the background must have been awesome.
SOMEONE MAKE THIS A WALLPAPER IN WALLPAPER ENGINE PLEASE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The smart person puts this in 2x speed for a quick hack.  The smartest copies the transcript and pastes into GPT to condense into a summary or essay that you can read in 1-10mins
I love the music in this
that indie game style soundtrack really fits. First part feels like a risk of rain 2 track while later is some terraria style goodness.
Not that often has a whole lot of nothing been so interesting :)
Music from Stenian to Cryogenian sounds like a Tool song interlude
I got an hour
As an animator, even imagining animating such an impossibly long continuous shot is making my PC melt, absolutely amazing stuff!!
there are better videos on YouTube... other than the music beats and basic animation, pretty ordinary... surprised it has got 350k+ likes
Impeccable soundtrack <3
I love the music, color pallet, and design of the Mesoarchean segment. It just has so much energy!
People are gonna watch this while on drugs
Truly remarkable! Just a minor feedback: I wish I could see the elapsed million years as well. So I could say: "Ahh it took 1300 million years to get here. "
Okay so did King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard make this soundtrack or did King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard make this soundtrack?
Making knowledge free for all, best channel ❤️
20:34 This is literally "rock" music 😆
Cool addition to Great Oxydation event and all prior ages would be the importance of reductive-oxidative shift in the nature of our atmosphere. It was first reductive, so all oceans were essentially swarmed with iron and other metal ions. After oxygen had began to be produced, all those ions were starting to form ores. This is essentially the way ALL ORES on our planet were formed. Also, it's the reason why oxygen levels didn't suddenly rise up to 21%, but have been kept nearly 7% for a couple hundreds of millions of years.
Babe wake tf up kurzgesagt posted a 1h video
I'm going to watch this probably another 50 million more times.
Pero que hermosura ❤
Lords Creations ❤
Now I finally can tell that you're Germans. Wassup with this deep house?)
What?😮 1hour Animation?😳
I've watched this 3 times and listened to the soundtrack twice now. The buildup to and payoff of the last 5 minutes is so worth it. It brings me to tears every time 🥹 Genuinely a work of art, will do again, thank you so much <3  Also, the beat to Submarine Time Machine did not need to go that hard, but I'm so glad it did x3
damn i  took a vape from my electronic cigarette and missed human history. guess ill watch again
I watched the whole thing. I was getting a little bored after 30 minutes but I though it will get interesting soon... Nope only last 6 minutes or something was interesting. It just puts in perspective how long it took for single cells to devolop. Also crazy to get into perspective how long dinoraures lived compared to us but they are just so little compared to what all happened before. Crazy
We are 1 second old in the 1 hour history of earth...
“Life is thriving, nothing can go wrong” Asteroid: now this looks like a job for me!
I learned something and the music was great too!
The fact that we humans are nothing else than a blink of an eye comared to the entire history of the earth shows how arrogant we are as a human species.😂 This was incredible. Thank you guys for this awesome video❤
Why. Only so that man can convert into women and women into men lmao😂
45:00 thank you algae
So cool. Thanks for making this!
10:23 _time travels_ "Wh-where am i?"
Excellent video Kurzgesagt team !
Kurzgesagt is one of the genius people of our time, they need more recognition and many thanks for your content, it's one of the milestones of internet <3
That video will blow up as it is doing right now, you deserve that. It's amazing.
We earthlings have really come far, havent we?
the eoarchean rain is confusing! the cause is not explained... where did water come to earth? was it from asteroids pounding?
The music goes crazy
I came for a documentary I stayed for the animation and music.
Can’t imagine how much time and effort were put into this project… outstanding work… thanks
It is possible that some of the debris from that object which collided with Earth is still inside earth , deep in crust .
0:28 “you can have this in the background… study to it”  37:30 *dancing, not doing any work, just lost vibing to the music*
I just came back from getting something to snack for 2 minu… 225 Million years. Whad did I miss?
The music is sooo good
i spent the entire video looking forward to the cambrian period. its my favorite. so much different life everywhere all at once seemingly from nowhere
"Life, uhh, finds a way!" -  Ian Kurzgesagt Malcolm
I'm sorry, I just don't see how life spontaneously generates from non-life without some kind of outside intervention. You really have to jump through some serious hoops to say that our world was fine tuned for life by chance and that organic life is just an emergent property of random chemistry. If that were the case, we should be seeing it happen still today. I believe God made it all in six days and that's the hill I'm dying on.
סרטון מעניין מאוד אבל הוא היה קצת ארוך מדי לטעמי
Beautiful video!
What a masterpiece. And such suitable music.
Why did watching a bunch of rocks and mold make me cry all of the sudden?
I have a question. In the Eoarchean, where did the rain come from? I mean, doesn't rain come from condensed water? How does it generate water out of thin air, when rain is produced by already existing water? Maybe I'm dumb or smth but I genuinely don't know
Waiting for my birthday thats in an hour from now on this. Perfect.
Aren't they just awesome 💜
we have barely here even a million years, already caused havoc on Earth.
NIce concept to present the phases in their true relative durations. But when the voice said the first cells appeared I thought "huh, that is sudden! Where did they come from? I would thik that in a 1 hour simulation we could have a bit more detail about the evolutionary stages from anorganic material to cells. Although we do not know what happened.
So awesome ❤
I rarely make comments like this, but this is a borderline, cinematic masterpiece. Your music team, or whoever did the music, absolutely phenomenal. Lots of Retrowave type of stuff, really cool drum sets, but aeration is great, the animation is phenomenal… There’s just so much to say. Let alone the information given
I'm going to play this in the background whilst cross stitching. Epic Mountain always has such amazing music.
🙌🏼••🪬•MUSIC•🪬••🙌🏼
"hot and comfy" THE SURFACE OF EARTH IS LAAAAVAAAA!!! awesome animation!
This documentary is awesome.
Took so many years to make, showed billions of years of earth but it just took me 30 min (because I was watching it in 2X) But dont worry I remember everything. Umm what was the first period again?
the perfect asmr doesn't exi...
We are soooooo insignificant on the scale of time. 😢
was there music 4275 years ago?
religious people be like: "but i ain't never seen a fish turn into a bird".. bro, it takes awhile, just give it a minute or two jeez.
29:44 glitch?
No words, just wow! ❤🎉
Wow! Already hyped for the sequel in 4,500,002,023!
imagine the animation sold as wallpaper for your computer
Allahu Ahkbar
A fantastic journey for the ears, eyes, and mind.
The musicians must have been sweaty by the end.
44:50 Shoutout to my boy bangiomorpha pubescens, a real one
Wrong explained 🤣🤣
Me are but a millisecond in time and space
This was the perfect video to have on my second screen while I worked, huge round of applause to all those who worked on it & those who helped make it happen!
Had absolutely no issue watching this through on regular speed, I didn't want to miss a change in scenery! What a piece of art! So very beautiful and the music is a cherry on top. It's still hard to grasp the scale of things, when a milloin years doesn't seem to fit a human brain at all. But it is a very unique way of representing the time periods flowing into one after the other. There's value in the simplicity of it.
YOU GUYS ARE TRULY BRILLIANT,  EPIC VIDEO, FROM VISUALS TO NARRATION TO THE MAGNIFICENT MUSIC. HATS OFF
This video really puts in perspective of how much American money America gives to foreign countries
fuck, i blinked and missed humanity, guess i gotta restart the video
Is the track available on Spotify?
this is such a cool video, I was wondering why they've been slow on posting
Quite literally Everything Everywhere All At Once
Thanks to everyone who worked on this video, truly amazing 👏👏👏
Epic Mountain is the GOAT!
I am only a kid but I'm getting THIS much information 🌏
It's so good     When you sead we are almost home I got chills
Had no idea just how big the Kurzgesagt team was until seeing the credits rolling at the end! You guys are HUGE! 😮
It was incredible. I can't imagine how much work it took to make this video.
this would be a sick ass screensaver/wallpaper
I've always wonder whats are the remnant of the early earth....... as it is said in the beginning (1:44),  almost none of it is left...
Bro really said "what a bummer 😅" 💀
Watch at X 0.25 speed
love this!
For any musicians here, it's really relaxing and satisfying to improvise on this music.  Take the F key as you base. The chord Fsus4 is always good (at least to ~28 minutes of the vid). Play in A-flat major.
"Don't blink or you will miss it" I'm sorry human history, I blinked.
The music is Perfect
When I'm in a 'the floor is lava' competetion and my opponent is the Hadean Period
I watched this while i was shiting on the toilet
Wow just wow
The algae Bangiomorpha pubescens are Gs
It was so tedious to watch, which is the point of this video. It's true that it's hard to fathom and appreciate the amount of time Earth has taken to form into what it is today, and we're just tiny specks in the grand scheme of timeline. Kudos for the amazing effort! It's kinda sad though that there are still people out there who'd scoff at this and rather believe that an imaginary man in the sky simply snapped his fingers to turn the sunlight on.
Very terraria like music, and view. It was exhausting to remember where from where i heard such music (genre). Nicely made!
Amazing concept of a video!
this is absolutely amazing
Props to your sound team! Your animation is always on point, but I don't think the sound guys get enough credit for what they do for your videos. Those are some lovely arpeggios :D
29:43
There should be a 5-minute version. This is waay too long
Would be AMAZING to have a version of this video that skips all the parts where there is no talking. That compresses everything down even further so you’re seeing how everything is changing on a faster time scale.
This is amazing, thank you!
"How many seconds in eternity?"
It’s impossible to know what happened that far back lol
Now I gotta ask, which time period would you want to visit for just one hour in like a hyper realistic dream?? hmm...
Fascinating how you can be so sure about something you are so wrong about.  Use a video full of lies. You are created, you have a creator. You did not evolve from goop, you were designed. You didn't come into existence from nothing exploding. How insulting.
this is seriously so cool
Couldn't avoid a "The floor is lava", huh?
Seen millions of years in seconds. All the time i was thinking please dont expand the human history- that was done spot on. Thank you❤
It's sooo relaxing and beautiful 💖✨🔥✨💖
45:00 Ayo shut out to those Bangiomophans or whatever they called, without them life would be so sad and misarable frfr 😀👍
Beats any thriller. Love the comic book style and the soundtrack.
this went past in a heartbeat. thank you.
Bro kurzgesagt is giving an hour of free info and entertainment every one in the team is the best!
At this point this is just background noise. This used to be a great channel for educational videos, but this is crap.
So basically Earth got cancer.
Think I just found my new favorite genre of music.  These jams, a good book, some tea, and a sandalwood candle. Flawless time. 🤩
Just hats off to you, thanks for this masterpiece.
I Love this sooo much! Would it be possible to loop some animations as to stretch the video to 10 hours? I would really love a video like this I could just play in the background while I study or read. Thanks again for all the great stuff you do! Greetings from Germany!
This is AWESOME!!! Can't imagine the work that went into this, but it's FABULOUS, especially for young kids to see and learn!
So...dinosaurs just happened, huh? Interesting theory.
such an amazing video thanks for making it I truly enjoyed it!
hi you're on a rock floating in space. some of it is wate, fuck it actually  most of it is water. i can't even get from here to there without... buying a boat. it's sad. i'm sad i miss you  *how did this happen*?  a long time ago, actually never ❌ nothing is nowhere. when? never. in fact you don't even need a where. that's how every it gets                                           forget this. i wanna be something. do something. go somewhere. i want to invent time and space! and i know it's posible because everything is already here. i just don't know where to start   and that's exactly where it started:  aoudhiushfodhigdug- *pause*  oh, i paused it. i think there's a universe now. *what's it made of?*  Quarks and Stuff™!    that's as far as my memory goes
this video, as well as all of Kurzgesagt’s videos are masterpieces.
Me: *Hmm if i wen tto the mesoarchean period it would be a nice hot spring!* Narrator: Theres no oxygen. Me: uhhhh... Narrator: Also, yo would die immediately in the atmosphere, Me: Nevermind.. then..
1 billion years is hard to fathom
Quite an undertaking.  As it was going I was wondering how you would do "Snowball Earth" and some other aspects.  I expected to see The Moon slowly getting further away and less volcanic as the video progressed.  I enjoyed seeing appearences by significant species in their correct time periods.  I was surprised you didn't mention the breakup of Pangaea at the end of The Jurassic as that was the birth of The Atlantic Ocean and what set the course for the map as we know it today.  It really did feel like riding a train back to your home from far away; things getting more and more recognisable the closer you get, and then suddenly the last distance is over before you know it.
This soundtrack is awesome; it's just BEGGING for a metal remix!
This is the most incredible channel I have ever witnessed.  I will forever support you guys, for some reason , I found myself crying at the end of this video. It's so beautiful how all of this happened.  Life is beautiful.  I am beautiful.  You are beautiful.  Billions of Billions of years, a few extinctions, and a LOT of luck later, we are sharing these short lifetimes together.  I love you all! Don't give up! ❤
This is such an insanely beautiful video! One can really see, how much time and effort went into making this
And not mentioned, our God created it all and set it into motion. He is timeless.
Amazing video. Awesome visuals the whole way through even though it was a whole hour! loved it
Stunning work :3
This score 🤩 the visuals 🤩
BRILLIANT
Life took forever. Really puts stuff into scale.
The music gose so hard
That is amazing!! what an incredible work!
this is my new stim video
I find mind-boggling that life on Planet Earth started as soon as the crust became solid but it slacked off in the unicellular stage for three billion years
Propoganda
Atleast thers a epic soundtrack in the background with some epic animation in the background its nice to Wach this while eating pierogi near the fireplace wear nice and makes me feel nice and comfterbale
I really love this project, its facinating, perfect and awesome. I learn a lot of new things in 1 hour, and indeed the evolution is beautiful.
I cannot begin to express my admiration and sincere gratitude for this monumental undertaking.  SO and Bravo to ALL who made this happen.
How about a video on the complete history of our current UNIVERSE? Maybe they are actually working on it!
Humans didn't take more than 1 second in a 1 hour timelapse. What does that make you think about yourself? Go do that thing you are afraid of. No one is watching anyway
This is so dumb
I want this as a wallpaper engine background that'd be great
+1 for everyone who watched it with 1.0x speed
WOW!!!! This is aaaaaaamazing! Well done all!
Who else stopped skipping parts since the Cambridge explosion?
how do i double like something, how do i triple like this, im definetly showing this to my kids
As if Kurzgesagt couldn't have come up with cooler ideas. Bravo.
51:14  If this refers to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, that is not a generally accepted theory.
what i dont understand though, is that u explain like 25 min in that earth cools down cus of c02 but rn we says it gets hotter cus of co2 (prob a dumb comment but just wanted to ask)
Instead of going to Heaven or Hell or be Reborn, I thought I'd be God Almighty the Alpha Omega Supreme in my own universe of course. I believe I am God's son and he doesn't mind. Wouldn't you want your child to be better than you? It's called Love. God did not make us as slaves as we are creating the AI's. He made us with Love. This video is very nice, I see I'll be spending a long time alone.
This video is an incredible piece of art! Thanks for bringing it to us and have me realize how tiny we are in cosmic timeline
This is the best video I have ever seen
Watched this at 2x speed. Still took me 4.5 billion years
this deserves to be put on science center and museum screens to loop for kids
Amazing work, thank you, I watched all of it.
The fact that half of the video the earth is just empty is crazy
This is very impressive!! i applaud you kurzgesagt!
with 1,6 million years per second, entirely human history only lasted less than 1 second at the end, wow
I know it would have taken a lot of hard work to make this video but honestly didn't had as much as some of your other videos.
@58:13 i see what you did there "Jeff Goldblum" wannabe~  XD  amazing video~ i think imma play this video during my commute to work everyday till i memorize this timeline.. really puts in to perspective of world's creation~ seriously, what a scale to grasp.. 1sec ~ 1.5million years..
With every single second passing in this presentation, you will have lived and died 20,298 times.   The whole time frame of this video is utterly incomprehensible.
So. Sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago. Interesting
Is it possible to get a version without the music but still have the sound effects? I'd like it on in the background with my own music over it
GUYS, 45:00 THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN SEX WAS CREATED
Such nonsense. They don't even present this as a theory, and a fantastical one at that.
This is all just an attention span test😂😂
I think this whole video would make an amazing Opera GX background loop not gonna lie
I used the fast forward button alot on this video.
such an amazing video, crazy how good it looks even though it was started in 2019. if you ever make a similar video, you could probably make it on human history (eg; 1 sec = 100 years). ill def be buying the poster too
Anyone else vibing with the music? It’s giving Daft Punk vibes.
What an amazing video, truly this type of thing makes me rethink my life. So happy I got to see this amazing piece of work. Congratulations to all the team.
the music goes crazy
How could we theoretically kickstart a new planet to becoming alive?
I am watching this video when it had 4.5 million views how convenient
This is a masterpiece
😂
1:00:43  why does the human have blue eyes?
It would be nice if they also mentioned and showed life forms of each period
When do you plan to change your name to "Langgesagt"? ;-)
Thank you very much for this @kurzgesagt
omg, really 1 hour, impossible. Guys you’re crazy
This was fantastic! It's amazing watching the early periods and thinking *whoa, the planet chsnged so slowly in the beginning.... then live took over and went NUTS!
4.5 billion years to study to
Happy 10th anniversary!
no one gonna give props to the music?  1 hour of a solid score.
One of the best Videos ever
The music, animation, and commentary is truly a work of art. I can lose myself with this for days.
45:00 Shout out to Banjo Morpha Pubescense for inventing sex in the Stenian period!
I think I've heard multiple sounds from terraria
What a wonderful job, thank you very much for this, it is very illustrative, didactic and entertaining....
No human name was mentioned during the talking of the earths history only nature and its magnificent force (hence why I clicked like)
God is real
Are there "YouTube awards"?  This should win something.
That soo cool i love this ❤❤
Get this video to 4.5 billion views
why skip when the asteroid hit
Wow this is marvelous
And man and woman just showed up with perfect compatibility and function. Still waiting for what started the big bang process in the beginning!
This video is an absolute masterpiece. I am always recommending this channel to my students to teach them about the amazing wonders of science outside of their usual curriculum. Thank you for bringing amazing scientific concepts to life!
When you think of how games are developed this isn't too different. Still impressive to watch it
This is epic
The music is absolutely awesome as well. Using a dedicated sample and adapting it to earths periods is fantastic
props to the cameraman for filming all this
Civilization 1 needs only a short Intro for the whole history of Earth instead an hour 😂
♥
This is one of the coolest things I have ever seen!
Congrats on the cameraman for recording this
We all forgot to thank the cameraman
I finally understand why the video must be in 1 hour duration
Outstanding video!
each second is 15,000 human lives. a minute is 900,000 human lives. the video is 540,000,000 human lives. but we get to enjoy just one of these. i'll try to live it to its fullest.
The Ectasian Era has such beautiful music, Kurzgesagt thank you.
Humanity, in it's whole, is just the briefest of flare-ups, potentially at the end of a planet's billion year long lifecycle. Like lighting an incredibly slow fuse to a pile of magnesium powder. Let's hope we can somewhen overcome our petty squabbles and give our briefest of moments an actual meaning.
I was like WHAT EVEN IS THE RHYACIAN OR THE STENIAN
For the geeks here - how long was the Doctor trapped inside te Confessional Dial? - Answer:
You should really translate some of your posters into other major languages.
This Video suits the band "The Ocean" Perfectly. especialy around 19:00
I really wish the music is more like anyma style kinda drum sound is just so not fitted
aint no way, fake and g
Which Boiler Room is th… huh?
Bill wurtz got it in 20'  (We'll check this one too though. You better sing some countries)
How do you mean that “aa det gör vi”? Maybe it translates better to something like “of course”, in English?
This is sooooooooooooo good!. This is sooooooooooooo good!.
GOAT YouTube video
watch this video 47,336,400,000,000 times to experience the true scale of earth's age!
God is the creator
Kids could learn from this vidios on schools, or maybe study at home?
Please win awards for this as Kurzgesagt deserves all recognition. Thank you.
but the earth is 6000 years old according to some ancient fantasy books
I feel a little guilty that this highly informatie and engaging stuff is free for the curious.Thanks for your service to humanity! :)
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE !!!
i am shook
A música é muito boa! Coloquei no loop e fico ouvindo enquanto trabalho...
speedish
Quaternary begins, humans happen, video ends. Well, that escalated quickly.
It would be nice to see something similar but set billions years in the future. I imagine it would be much harder to do, because the future is uncertain.
29:43 AI generated graphics glitch?
You are a wonderful channel and your efforts are truly well noted by everyone across the world. Love from Kenya.
What nonsense. Scientists already agree that dinosaurs were here only thousands of years ago, not millions and billions.
This is literally insane. Thank you!
Doom Music
I really hate the music on this but i love the video imma reupload it without the crap music
shoutout to the guy with the camera
Everything about this is amazing, from the information to the visual and the music 🎉🎉🎉  I love the music the most. Cheers to the creator 🥂
Your videos are a great service to the collective knowledge of all humanity.
A Beautiful😍✨❤  video
The visuals are absolutely epic!!! The music is also lit 🔥🔥
This is an incredibely ambitious project, for which I cannot praise you enough!!
Is there any option to download/buy video without the youtube compression? @kurzgesagt
Hi, you're on a rock floating in space.
“At this period of time the floor is lava”…so was in 2016
Super cool video idea! I also LOVE the music, im listening to it at work at it lets me vibe and focus at a good level 👌
All these animations for a fragment of bill wurtz
This video is so amazing, it puts it into perspective how we as a species haven’t been on this space rock for long at all. Thank you so much for this video ❤
Good ol' Orosirian.. I remember those days.. like they were yesterday. Miss em!
YALL SHOULD SUBSCRIBE AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO
This is simply a delight to watch and on top of that its free!.. mainly commenting for the algorithm to catch on
All my love, to the Legends who made this. It's awesome!
Arguably your best video yet!!!
Ironically, the beat while we were still a ball of lava was fire!
I just want to say that musics are composed geniusly. Excellent job !!
Maybe its rocket science and so I don't understand but I am thrown off by the countdown. It starts at 4543 million years ago instead of 4.5 billion like the title says. Is it trying to say 4,thousand,543 million years?
With this you just created one of the best videos ever appeared on this platform ❤
This is absolutely incredible. Thanks @Kurzgesagt 🙏🍁🔥
who else watched the entire thing i mean from beginning to the end, all 1 hour 3 minutes and 30 seconds of it
I'm sitting through this on x2 speed
Ahhh, quick stroll down memory lane
3:50 Dude i want this on newgrounds so i can use it in a GD level!!! I LOVE THIS PART!!!
Fallen asleep to this 4 times
You forgot to mention the part where FNAF was released
Thank you so much to everyone who worked on this!
I always find the timescales the most thought provoking. ONE second is about ONE MILLION YEARS!! Practically nothing happend in a million years in the early days. Putting this in perspective to the time we humans exist (around 200.000 years). Let alone one lifetime of a homo sapien 🤯. Enjoy the ride people!!
That was great!  I watched the whole thing at normal speed, including the credits.  I appreciated the simplicity of the layout, though I would like to have seen atmospheric makeup and average temperature as we went, too..  Thank you!
Okay but what’s the person or people that made the music for this whole video?
It's humbling to see how little the mighty humans have changed the planet in the grand scheme
Beautiful 😍
This goes in the top 10 most legendary videos on YouTube!
I finally finished the video. Please do the human history next! This video was a great experience.
pretty 'DOOM' vibes, the soundtrack for the Mesoarchean period.. 👍🫰
Thank you so much Kurzgesagt! This video accompanied me during me assessing my students' writing.
“The sun is a deadly lazar” Oh wait wrong video sorry.
Und wann kommt das Video in deutscher Sprache?
Great content Guys... Apart from this if anyone is interested in this topic, they can watch COSMOS episode 1.... Very well executed
So crazy to think that if an hour represents the entire history of Earth, we’ve been in it for not even two seconds.
15:40
i had a complete meltdown before the video was uploaded. it was nice to relax to a slideshow showing of how significant and small we are. made me stop crying over my life falling apart
First time seeing this video I immediately thought, "No, that can't be it" but here it is.. it's amazing
This should be played at schools for all kids.
That was absolutely stunning, thank you for this video.
@55:55 that mf decided to step out on land, and now I have to deal with taxes and finances
the music is pretty awesome
Listen @ 1.25x speed. Enjoy dancing and thank me later lmaoo
This theory is so much better then the "we all placed by god" theory in my perspective.
The smooth song so good ngl
reptiles lived longer than us. reptilians still exist today?
I feel like the Boring Billion was a missed opportunity. No depiction of the purple Canfield ocean? Of cyanobacteria and lichens starting to colonize the land? Of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia during the Tonian?
I'm just here for the Boring Billion
"4.5 billion years in 1 year. Impossible for your brain to truly grasp". Yeah it is because this is a lie. You're going off of evolution theory which is a theory which means it isn't proven. Anyone that wants to debate me on this, I'll completely school you.
Thank you for 10 years of education!
"it rains fir millions of years". So, basically, London
It amazes me that I've watched an hour-long video about the entire history of the Earth as a planet with a moon, and yet I have not even the faintest idea of what I would see if the video were extended by just one second.
I'm not gonna lie, this type of video needs to be in the Smithsonian.
How did they animate this in 4 weeks
super cooooooooool vid
Couldn’t help yourself huh? You just HAD to drop the Jeff Goldbloom line from Jurassic park….    I hope you’re proud of yourself.
@kurzgesagt you could host my next birthday party with these visuals and music. Also some burning facts to keep the guests engaged.
this is incredible
I wish there was wayyy more talking in this video. I was disappointed when I realized it would MOSTLY blow just a moving slideshow. The underlying concept was cool, I just found myself upset every time the narrator stopped talking.
35:15 anyone else hear any signs of turtle power?
Truly remarkable!
suddenly i dont feel old anymore looking at those zero lollll
Why does it say "millions" of years ago up in the corner, when the video is still in the billions point? That's a bit confusing.
If 1.5 Million years was One Second All Of Human History Since 300,000 Years ago would have been 0.2 Seconds And The Whole Holocene Would Be 0.0078 Seconds Which Is 7.8 Milliseconds
how long did this take
Wow loved this video! Random question: anyone know how it rained for so long during the Eoarchan period? and where did that come from? (10:00)
I know i'm asking a lot but how about one hour for the entire existence of the universe ? Still.. great job this video is amazing
Teach me you guys animating style 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😊
FUNGI THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thomas Veith and Fabian Glaser, one or both of you dropped the ball HARD.  The soundtrack for this is terrible.  It's jarringly at odds with the visuals.  The gently scrolling animations are peaceful and superb, but the music is irritatingly high tempo and loud in comparison to Steve Taylor's voice.  An exceptional misstep from a typically amazing channel.  Disappointing.
The music is really what puts the cherry on top here!
Feels like playing the old Platypus game
'much hot and comfy' ???
I'm watching this at x2 speed. and I kinda like the vibe
not enough people talking about the incredible music
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Playing this in the background of my next party. The music is so good too!!
Imagine how aggressive the rain in eoarchean was. Think with me, when there is one unusual drought, that lasts over 2 months, in a city, (especially now with the climate change thing happening), the storm that comes after it can submerge houses and destroy streets and other facilities in minutes. Now think of this cenário where literally all the water of this world (or at least great part of it) is vaporized in the sky, falling in the surface of earth. It must have been like a waterfall coming from the sky
4k and animated thank you, team.
We r so lucky to have such good educational videos. Forever grateful.
I wonder what the next second will look like? 🤔
What a BEAUTIFUL video (for SOO many years!)!  The facts, the music, the animation, the quality, the narration, the fact it’s $Free.99!  Thank you for the reminder if not only how cool Earth and geological time and how it relates to humans is; but also thank you for all the hard work you all put in for us to watch this essentially free!
Oh cool! The earth woke up, and made a video about itself 👌
One word. Woah.
Adding this to my playlist of most iconic YT videos of all time.
THIS is what they should be showing and teaching children in schools. Instead they want to poison them with gender ideology and race theory.
this would be a good desktop live wallpaper
can someone explain why  there's so many asteroids 4B yrs ago but none later on?
The credits took longer than human history  Kurzgesagt is going to be around for a while
Thank you so much for this amazing science video Kurzgesagt 💛 It was informative and visually appealing 💜
**Sets to 2x Speed**  *YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CUT ME OFF (RIGHT NOW)*
but i am Christian though
Great video so far, im only 30 mins in, just a little criticism, there is so much to say in the first half hour but its mostly void from narration, so much information is omitted that could have been included
this was amazing watching it from start to finish and the music to top the animation was perfect i loved it so much.
I realized something, since life arrived at some point or an other what were bacteria or single cell organism consuming at first? Since it was the first form of life? What were they eating?
Shout out to the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens
You should make a fun mobile game like flappy bird or zombie tsunami. 😁  I would definitely play it during my free time  if the animation looks like this, and with the ducks, aliens, etc.
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state, Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait... The Earth began to cool, The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools, We built a wall (we built the pyramids), Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery, That all started with the big bang!  20 seconds < 1 hour
Am i a god now?
this is an ingenius way to add major watchtime for the channel. but I have some criticism: 1. the music is rather awful, we could do with more calming music. or better yet, a template where we can add our own music 2. we all love Kurzgesagt animation, but I have to admit I'm not used to this channel drawing landscapes. I much prefer they do this in our favourite isometric format.
wow!!!!this really gives into perspective how life is not that old in earth, and how humans really just have a glimpse of all earth history, I really though dinosaurs lived 2.5 billion years lmaoo
Why is the Rhyacian period such a bop tho!?
It is first time I had to speed the video made by this channel
Actual title: goofy ah terraria music for an hour
What kind of idiot would thumbs down this video?   There's 3000+ of them.
They could have put this as series
At which point the atmosphere was survivable for human to live on? Right after the great oxidation event that finally provide Oxygen?
I love how they've recently made the script funnier and more whimsical. The narrator's more sarcastic and a bit more sassy, and it's great.
Meanwhile humans are like I bet we can save the planet in 12 years by banning gas stoves
you could have done other galactic event / solar system events; or even since the big bang
The music is absolute fire 39:19
this video is pure art and science!!! I LOVE IT!
BORING BORING
In a few thousand years scientists will prove the USA existed for 100 million years and no one will dare contradict science
I appreciate the leifmotifs in some of the songs composed in this video, like at 56:47 where there's an instrumental/choir taken from the video "The Human Era"
please keep making these kinds of videos i would rather watch these than cringe tiktok videos nowadays
The Hadean Eon is a great place for a nuclear test b.t.w.
Im gonna save this video in my favorites. Will watch this with my grandkids if god wills
have a nice trip
44:52 Okay, googling came up with nothing. IS Banjomorpho Pubescence a real algae? I need to know if this is a joke.
POV: You live in England 8:40
Beautiful guys
I need the "4.5 Billion Years in 4.5 Billion Years" next!
This was just awesome haha
An actual masterpiece. What a unique work of informational art. Man I love this channel.
"history of the entire world i guess" 2; ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
So if most of earth's history was just rocks, pools, and oceans, us humans expanding everywhere and doing the things we humans do must be, from earth's perspective (if it has sentience), like a particularly bad rash, but nothing major. Nothing a few good scratching sessions (read "major geothermal activities") can't fix!
I feel incredibly lucky
sick
B E S T   V I D E O   E V E R  !  !  !
interesting but too much of time! would rather see and share the edited version where they say so this went on for so many seconds, clik here to jump to that...and the last few seconds/ millions of years - a lot of species, spend 2 minutes on it
This reminds me of an instrumental song by Mat Zo called “Order out of Chaos”
I got a question: If photosynthesis might have started way before the Great Oxidation Event, then how come those little critters doing the photosynthesis not make oxygen? I thought photosynthesis created oxygen. Was it just such a small amount that it didn't pave the way for more complex life that the Oxidation event did?
I would buy the music track in the background!
You are a true treasure and resource for all. This is modern art in the truest sense.  Thank you!
i will pay for this kind of shit. jeez man i don't think you are in the good business model. i hope Kurzgesagt team are living well. kudos to you all i fucking love you
This was so cool! Absolutely nailed the perspective on how long earth really has been around and how slowly things really do take.   There are so many ways you can take this further but damn, I believe it when you say you guys have been working on this for the past few *years*; absolutely well done!
THIS RULES!! awesome job! holy crap! more! more! more!
This is the opposite of TikTok
This is the most incredible Slow TV
I almost cried when he said it is our time and we’re almost home 😭😭😭 Wonderful animation!!
Your Universe app is my favorite thing ever. Puts things into perspective and it blows my mind every time...
This was wonderful, right up to the point everything came to a screeching halt, and someone started screaming at me to buy some Pizza Hut.
Bill Wurts did it in less than 20 min.
thank you i love you guys
The audio of this video is incredible!
Let 'em cook.
03:50 AlienPls
Can anyone tell me what he is talking about @37:07 ? What nuclear reactor?
"Good job, if you're still watching; you've witnessed a billion years, so far!" are my new favorite song lyrics.
This along with Bill Wurtz' History of the World, I guess. Are probably the best ways to learn about how the earth came to be in a relative short amount of time.
Probably, maybe, don't know. I know one thing, this happened 2k years ago when our sweet 6lb 6oz sweet innocent baby jesus touched the land from the immaculate conception.  j/k people are fucking wild.
this would make a good, long, Geometry Dash map
The years of work on this paid off. Most memorable youtube video i've come across in years
This dude is a legend
More than 3000 people disliked the video? WHY?!
Me and the boys playing the floor is lava in the Hadean era
It’s crazy to think humans don’t even have a full second in this video 🤯
The animation doesn't show the Carnian Pluvial Episode around 234-232 million years ago. Just a tidbit, essentially where it rained on Earth for about two million years.
This is amazing in this hour video so much effort and passion into this and it’s free what a gem. I love it keep going  and you will achieve great success and God bless Kurz :)
Just from what I've seen of people, you might have wanted a cave man with like a modern person standing behind him lol loved the video though!
Loved this video. I can guarantee I'll be coming back to it to put it on in the bg again and again.
The music is great!
I wont know what to do once this voice actor passes bro, it’ll be the end of an era truly 😔
the title shouldve been "4.5 billion years in a nutshell" instead of 1 hour, as that would be more fitting.
You should do the origin of the universe from all the religions. I'm a Christian, and I've always wanted you to do a series like that.🌌
I have a new perspective on Earth and it’s history
I didnt blink grrr NooOOOooOoOooooOOOOoOOo
amazing!!
This is amazing. Will play in repeat for a couple of days. Love the music, very fitting.
45:02 Thank you Algae Bangiomorpha pubescens!   this was a top notch watch and listen fest. saving it to my special playlist
Shout-out to the cameraman for spending 4.5 billion years filming this video
Good job team Kurzgesagt this is a masterpiece 🙂
Life truely finds a way… if all the past creatures just knew how much would come after them on the exacr same place they used to inhabit. My house might just be exactly where some dino ate a plant couple of million years ago. Just crazy to think about.
This is great, the music makes it even more relaxing and enjoyable. When I see the events I begin to think what it would have been like to witness everything in person as if you were an all-seeing divine being and with the passing of each second, being one with evolution.
Esto es genial, la música lo hace aún más relajante y agradable. Cuando veo los acontecimientos empiezo a pensar cómo hubiera sido presenciar todo en persona como si fueras un ser divino que todo lo ve y con el pasar de cada segundo, siendo uno con la evolución.
It’s amazing how long earth has been alive.. watching this I realized this is only the beginning for mankind. Billions of years of weathering, erosion, extinction, and volcanic eruptions to shape our planet we know today. Funny how tiny life began, then to imagine how huge it evolved to!! And yet a near extinction, life still managed. Towards the end humans have only existed for less than a million years. Yet look at our advancements over time, from the first super computers, to the Apollo 11, and now a potential Lunar station on the moon! Who knows what will happen next. As we continue to make history every step we take. Remember these words, take a good look at our planet. Take care of our planet.. for it is like a mother to us. Taking care of every living thing to ever exist on its surface. Thank you so much, have an amazing evening lads. ❤️ 🌎
Shout out to the camera man for recording for 4.5 billion years
This is spectacular.  A well thought out and executed factual fast-forward to our time.  Will we make it for you to create the next second of video?!
me watching this so my calculus homework is more bearable <3
I love how this is not only a nice screensaver/background video, an educational video, and a music album all in ONE video. This is honestly one of the best videos I have ever seen on this platform
I am going through a hard time right now, and I put this on the background as I chart and unpack my thoughts. Cheers to all those going through emotional turmoil. What happened to each of us is different, but we all are hurting.
Every part of this video is getting some love, but I'm not seeing much about the music. One piece of music had so many genres mashed into it, and yet each era sounded like it looked. Massive props to the music department.
Soundtrack sounds pretty rad on 2x speed.
Hadean might have been hell on Earth but the techno soundtrack was awesome
Don't blink, the minute or so of this is going to be hectic...
Watched this in one sitting and it felt like 10 minutes! Really an incredible, mindblowing video. The work that must have been put into this is truly astonishing. Thank you Kurzgesagt ❤❤
I guess this one isn't sponsored by bill gates
It's not my birthday, but it feels like the best birthday I've had so far. Amazing
The music SLAPS LIKE REALLY HARD, idk feels like metroid, doom and hollow knight for me.  im just YEAHHHH SCIENCE
Thank you so much Kurzgesagt! This is super informative, and I would love to know more about the history!
I loved it. Can't wait for the version in Spanish
Entire history of the world, I guess sequel dropped
OMG! This is so cool I have NEVER seen anything like this before! I am amazed as much as I am with Out of Scale
Fungi things ;)
I imagine having a party with this video as soundtrack
This video would only be about .0001 seconds if it was the actual time the earth has existed
I didn’t know how long we were in the hadean phase
Very amazing
This is at least a weeks worth of great falling asleep content
At 55:41 , seeing the Dunkleosteous appear made my day. I was just waiting for it to appear, and it did! I probably sound like a 5 year old writing this, but it’s seriously a good detail.
This was absolutely wonderous. I thought I quickly check out what it is about. End the end I did watch the whole thing (with a bit use of the arrow keys) Wow. Thank you so much for this. Makes me want to learn about geology. Amazing job! Proud to be you Patreon :-)
❤❤❤
Yo why this so entertaining I guess it’s because I love planets and moons and stars
5 minutes in, and I'm already loving this video. You guys have outdone yourselves this time.
This is the loading screen for gta 6
history of humanity, one blink and u missed it.
perfect video for a lazy midnight snack
WE GETTIN’ TO THE SINGULARITY WITH THIS ONE!!!1!1!
4.5 billion years of history in 1 hour and I still fail the history test 🙁
Bro you have grown so fast and I love watching your videos so much!
45:00 a hallowed day
Where is 1 Hour in 4.5 Billion Years? Waiting....
Just beautiful
*bill wurtz* "hold my beer"
"Good job if you're still watching. You've witnessed a billion years so far..."    Dude! This is one of the most engaging and interesting videos I've watched in a long time! I'm eating this up.
I'm very absurdist, I see people all over here saying kurzgesagt is making human achievement seem insignificant.   I just can't agree with that, here's my perspective: Humans, in .06% of a second, have managed to do all this. I see it not as an insult to human accomplishment, but as tribute to the utterly extreme power of humans and of having society.  I like to believe we're at the very very beginning of modern humans, or that we might even be considered ancient humans at some point when human's DNA have changed enough.
Props to epic mountain music for making this beautiful 1 hour soundtrack. So many different vibes thoughout the track and awsome transitions between them. Too amazing!!!
Music is spot on 👌
You saw that minecraft video, huh?? Lol
Hold on what does he mean by "-invented sex, Big reproductive improvement, *For many differant reasons."
Mammals have only dominant the last minute....😢😭😭😭
The Mesoarchean theme has no right to go that hard. 🔥🔥
Best youtube video idea ever
Remember the entirety of human history takes about 0.13 seconds
The real question is, how is it even possible to know what happened 4 billion years ago???
The editing probably felt like 4.5 billion years too, mad respect
Again - but without the commentary.
This video is the opposite of Bill Wurtz's "the history of the entire world, I guess" video
This seems like a movie that you've seen spoilers for, but don't know where the spoilers happen, so you just wait, anticipating for the spoilers to happen
The deep house track is a banger too lmao
the real ones watch this at .0000006X speed
Waiting for someone to say the cameraman always survives
i’ve been watching your videos since before i started taking german, and the title is a lot more simple to understand now: kurz: short, small gesagt: to speak
You should release a version with just the music for a study background!
amazing! Ever think youll do one for universal history, or perhaps human civiliation? You show the impossible size of time very well!
Happy anniversary, our beloved Kurzgesagt!
This is wonderful, thank you for providing us great contents🥰
Bill wurtz walked so kirzgesaagt could run
omg they animated this for 4.5 billion year!!?!?
One of the main reasons is that it takes out of context the only constant in the cosmos, which of course is not the speed of light. In fact, all theories have meaning and relevance in different aspects, but none of them connect with the other due to the absence. of the ignored constant.  Fortunately, the unifying theory of everything is being developed and in a simple and elegant way unites and explains the processes of creation of the cosmos that includes a plausible and logical description of existence.  The process is started, the answers will be available very soon  greetings Eduardo Cardenas
Absolute bops from Epic Mountain as always.
I want my time life back! This is, by far, the worst video from the channel. Oh, right, the purpouse is to put things in perspective, but  they could fiil de animations with more things (certanly occured more). What waste of... time.
It really sounds like the narrator is saying 'billion' on occasion, when the counter reads 'million'...
Wow,just amazing
You have changed my life Kurzgesagt!!! Thank you for making so many videos that are both interesting and fun to watch  ^^  Now I'm completely up-to-date on the history of the Earth.
Thank you for your hard work!
Incredible!
You think I can't watch minutes of lava falling with nothing happening? Years of playing idle games have trained me, nay, hardened me. This is child's play for me!
Hmm not visually interactive enough sadly
bro i am watching this so high rn can recommend jesus christ this is an experience
Like if watch this in 0.25x speed for better immersion.
The sound track is sick. Could totally jam with those guys 🔥
This video is incredible, I love to dedication I see from the channel every video and this one more than takes the cake but eats it too!
58:00 'the ancestors of birds do bird things'  CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW CAAAW
"And the floor is lava" 🤣🤣🤣
This was wonderful! I've always wanted to make a memory palace of the geologic ages of the Earth, and this was finally a beautiful and just long enough for each era (had to pause a bit there near the end with how fast they moved!) way to do it! Thanks for the great video, lots of good feels.
Well done
This video needs a „no commentary“ version
Fake, God created everything in a week
Damn, that drop about the core at 42 minutes. Level up.
A billion is a big number. If you count one number per second, never taking a break, you'd reach a billion in about 32 years. No one could count to 4.5 billion.
This made me cry for some reason 💀
I will reserve this to watch and/or listen to the next time I change my perception of reality and consciousness on purpose <3 Thank you so very much, Kurzgesagt! For all the beautiful trips, so far and to come ^_^
Most of this is actually programming
Do you have a version of this without the music? I love the commentary, but I have an idea for a music Playlist that would go well with each epoch/eon or whatever
Watching this stuff stoned is amazing
shoutout to the cameraman for managing to record all of earths history
41:00 'the first fungi appear and do fungi things'... (avoiding explanation of what fungi is/are and why they came about)   ((I think fungi came from Mars, it was around this point Mars started to die, maybe))
It was simply beautiful 🤩 Thank you Kurzgesagt for such a journey! 🤍
THe floor is laVAA
What if the Asteroid was an alien bomb so all the dinosaurs died so we can evolve as an human experiment
This is outstanding content, thank you!
THIS IS SO COOL!!
This video shows how we are insignificant in the grand story of Earth
Love how this came out at about the same time the Netflix documentary came out about the same thing. Been spending the last week reflecting on the evolution of our planet, the way that life evolved over time. Seeing the stunning apocalypse events, the way that live just comes back stronger and better each time. It just fills me with hope for what the future of life will look like... (Robots anyone? lol)
This is nonsense, a video based on pseudo science.
"The entire history of the world, I guess"
Awesome, you managed to make a Tool album
I wonder if in german schools they still have this practice that at the last day of school, usually before summer vacations, there is so little to do that most teachers just watch a movie or smth. Most of the time us students wouldn't care much for the movie selection (cause most of them were older than our parents) but just be happy to chill. Now, if THIS were one of the movies, e.g. for biology class, that would have been a different matter. And from what i hear, there already are science teachers here who use Kurzgesagt videos in their classes.
Compare this to bill wurtz
Love your videos and thank you for your hard work, love showing these videos to friends and family, unfortunately this is a little too long with not much information, hard to keep the attention of non fans but was great for work listening, thank you again
Great job, thanks
27:00 that thing felt like terraria
No, GOD DID
90% of this channel is crap and lies...
Music to accompany the entire journey is on another level. Master piece.
love the ending
Genial
is this just a serious version of "history of the universe, I guess"
These songs kind of make me sad because life was paradise and it was destroyed so quickly… ❤
I rarely trip on just cannabis. Thank you Kurtzgesagt.
No... Life is always slow... It always happens slow and will always happen slow...
Awesome👏
Make the music for this must have been REALLY fun. I would love to work with you
You probably don't know the monetization values for 44 million views, but let me tell you it's not a small amount😅
Parabens pela dedicação
Please translate it 🙏🙏
Gibt es dieses Video auch auf deutsch ?
I love how near the start of the Mesoarchean (around 19:40 to be precise), the Kurzgesagt music team starts channeling their inner Mick Gordon and produces a bassline so thicc that Doomslayer himself would be proud
Typing in pdfs to this 😌
The fact people believe this is insane
Why did it rain for millions of years? Where did the original water come from?
Kurzgesagt casually just releases the biggest W on the platform, my decendants will enjoy this for generations!
Life finds a way.
Insane that this isn’t YouTube premium exclusive. Absolutely legendary my guy
The concept of this video is so cool
arrived because of the curiosity stayed for the music
Oh wow- This is a golden video right here... Amazing work! Well made indeed! ❤ I swear I kept seeing ducks or duck formations in the rocks, mountains, ocean floor, etcetera, up until the first dinosaurs. 😂  You get 9/10 stars from me. Not 10 because you forgot to add something... An actual duck! 😅
I’ve been watching over 12 minutes so far and pushing a billion years. At the back of my mind I keep thinking about how Homo sapiens will just take a brief fraction of a second at the end of the video. I’ve known the fact of our time frame, of course, but experiencing it like this really changes my perspective on our relationship to the planet.
Something from them that is existential dread!
I rarely agree with the conclusions of Kurzgesagt; this was no exception. However, your videos are usually amazing, and this was an exception. This was beyond amazing. Thanks for combining art and science in a way few can claim!
i feel like Moses getting a vision to write down the events of creation
The music ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This would also be really interesting if it was of only Human History.
A
Gah Dayum that music and animation hits different
I will from now on link to this video when in any form of discussion about anything. Like put a perspective on things!
First off, May I sample this to make music? like this haden period beat got mad potential, and throwing in the narrorator voice would be great for a house track very trippy <3 second off LOVE THIS CHANNEL
Can we somewhere get only the animation with music? I need to use while studying. PLEASE
And yet we still worry about things we think are big, but aren't even close to mattering
Just makes me think how absolutely and blindingly arrogant humans are. :(
And, props to the cameraman who took 4.5 billion years to film a video in flaming hell and ice ages, with meteors and asteroids crashing into Earch all around him.
1 billion years later you missed World War 5 In the sun being used to collapse into a black hole☝️🤓
This type of stuff always makes me feel like we probably are just living in simulation.
I can't even make an animation with music, and you've gone and devoted your people's lives into making this, the video i was watching, and made it so good, for 1 hour? Allthe editing must have taken, like a century. I would suggest you made a poster of this. Also,the music. you have made it match the scene way too well. Keep up the great work!
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked...!
I think it would've been nice to have something in the corner displaying "us", an organism displayed, giving us a sense of the evolution of life, along the line to humanity.
I wasn't expecting the funky music in the hell of lava not gonna lie
Absolute banger. In all aspects, the music especially tho, damn.
cool animations, was hoping for more talking about each stage tho :/
I can’t say anything that hasn’t already been said in the comments , This. Is. Astonishing!! Just thank you from the bottom of my recently made ❤
to everyone who animated this, i wish you a very happy life, good fortune, and peace and quiet ❤
The Animation is absolutely beautiful and whoever mixed the music needs a raise cause the whole one-hour track is 🔥
Awesome
Please release this master piece in german, too!
Why do I hear FatBoy Slim - right here, right now ? :D
The music and animation was amazing.   I love this channel.   Makes me love humanity and the world. So hopeful and happy. Life is amazing and beautiful.
The sequel to history of the world I guess? 😧
The fact that human history was 1 second is so good
Not only is the video amazing, the music is absolutely incredible. Especially love the acoustic drumming and the distorted bass lines. No duh, that’s because I’m a bassist. Some have a really nice proggy feel. A little Tool too.
This music rocks!
Just insane
This must’ve takes billions of years to film, just shows the cameraman’s dedication.
and the floor is lava xDD
This is false anti-Turkish propaganda. Everyone knows the first multicellular organisms were in fact TURKISH-speaking sons of Anatolia
heh heh, this is 10 billion percent scientific 👌🏽
Hope this made you feel something? Damn right. Humbled and very moved.
Great music
melodysheep: "I can do 13.8 billion in 10 minutes"
4 years is wild.
best video so far
Wow, just wow. Thank you for your passion ❤ a masterpiece. The music so lush, loved it so much 💚🙏🏻
This is incredible! 20 minutes in and the Mesoarchean soundtrack absolutely SLAPS!!❤ Loads of people have applauded the animation (rightly so), but massive props to the sound design 👏
The narrator will literally be the next David Atenborough in a while.
The music is just 👌.....What an unbelievable video
Could we get a 10 hour version of this? Hopefully you can loop the animation to make it less taxing. I'd play this during longer commutes.
Okay. There are minutes of repating, so massive of animation I can't see, cause of the loops. But it is definitly awesome
Loved the spongebob transition screen in 31:00
pls in german too
Soundtrack is heavily Tool inspired in the Tonian era, don't deny it Kurzgesagt 😅
Soundtracks are 🔥
that background must be 1:100000000000
The true creation story, that one seems believable as it doesn't take less than a minute to explain.
I want the soundtrack for this clip... Totally had this opened while I'm working too! ;D
That was a trip.
Cant wait for it to be outdated in 3 billion years
I don’t have the patience for long videos
Cool, I'm going to be having an extistential crisis in the corner now
Can we all agree on getting goosebumps as soon as the Cretaceous started? That music. Oddly nastolgic.
That's crazy, you made this video!!! 😱
45:00 caught me of guard
This is soo woow! Truly blew my mind! Thank You for this aaweesoomee video, must watch again.^^
Best channel ever
19:41 Why did the music suddenly feel like making some toned down doom eternal soundtracks? Caught me mad offguard but pleasantly, it was a bop.
simplesmente, incrivel, obrigado por criar esse video!
Everything in this video feels it was made with love and passion for this project. I specially love the music, but i've got to appreciate that a 1 hour long animation is free to watch and its quality is INCREDIBLE! Thank you so much, Kurzgesagt team!
the soundtrack is so good as well
Mesoarchean music ROCKS!
Can we have a music-only version please? I love the narration but having just the visuals with music would be awesome for some occasions.
“Sex was invented one billion years ago by algae” sounds like a shtpost but it might just be true
The mesoarchean beat is sick 👌
Where does þe heat come from to keep þe earþ molten for 500 million years? The sun surely can't play an important role, since we're living at ca 16° now, not 2000°. Is it all radioactive decay?
This is like Kurzgesagt's magnum opus. These incredible videos is why I get the calender every year, have 5 posters and just bought the blanket. I love the animation style and want to do what I can to support it. Absolutely amazing.
Kurzgesagt should be preserved by the UN
This was really beautiful. Thank you!
L video. 90% was filler. Shame on Krgst.
my dentist put me an teeth of zircon does it means my teeth have 4.5billion years! fantastic video and great music <3
This video shows that evolution theory is a bullshit!
I like the animation that came with this playlist
Bill wurtz whould be proud!
O vídeo é chato, ficando legal só no final, assim como a história da Terra. Assisti ele todo, lamento ter perdido tanto tempo, mas o Kurzgesagt foi brilhante no empenho e no propósito de mostrar como a história que importa pra nós na verdade não é nada.
Is going to be a long procesing of informations
where did the water come from?
This new Tool album is dope!
It's crazy that Nautilus have been around on our planet for 8 minutes! But seriously, wicked cool video and puts so much context to the incredulous nature that is life.
I sure did feel something watching this, Steve, holy crap. The music swelling as you say "It is our time now, we are almost home" gave me chills. Thanks for this awesome experience, Kurzgesagt!
It's still just a theory tho. Wonder if one day science can show how life began
Sooo cool🤩. Thanks for all the effort you put into it.
Mesoarchean music goes hard.
Thank's for this video and all the others that you have created ! I love science especially paleontology since I was little and this video is cool and relaxing to watch.
flat earthers love this video. look how far the train goes and never curves.
Nonesense😂repent to God and stop this lie
this entire video would be a awesome desktop background, could even take parts of it and play on loop as their independent backgrounds!
History of the entire world, I Guess
You've got a good tune.
Yo where can I get a hold of this sound track???? Everything about this is Absolutely insane
Without that meteor strike 65M years ago, dinosaurs would likely still be around and I'm not sure we'd enjoy their company that much. So, thank you meteor!
This is so good, please make one for the universe too!
I need to watch this whole thing in theater
Some of these would be cool to have on wallpaper engine
44:55 Nice
Everybody is praising the animation work. However, I’d like to take the time to appreciate the soundtrack. It’s so goood!
Props to the composers of playing live quality music for 4.5 billion years! Truly magnificent
Damn, yall knocked it out of the park again! This is my new background study video
this is crazy, thank you for doing this!!!
This is so interesting! It really gives a perspective on how incredibly long deep time is. I've heard 4.5 billions years so many times but no matter how much I try to picture it's vastness my brain just squishes it down. Great way of showing the scale of things!
An hour was a bit short… I might watch it again 😊
Mesoarchean music \m/
Risk of Rain sounding 46:18
I was literally studying for a test and reading the word "stromatolites" the second they said it I heard it in the video at 17:50
who the hell are the 2k plus disliking this absolute masterpice...
Yes this hell phase will take a very long time for you liars.
Me senti insignificante
make another pls
Had a tough day at work today. But getting a bit of perspective made me smile.
is that made with blenders grease pencil??
thanks kurzgesagt ❤️‍🔥😸
I feel so lucky to not have been born in the Hadean phase
such kind of videos always get me thinking that somewhere out there could be another planet where life is / was being formed
Epic...
Can't praise this video enough.  Different but still so on-brand.  Music reminds me of No Man's Sky
You don't need GH gasses to make you comfy when the surface of your planet is literally made of white hot lava...
The fact the dinosaurs are no more, makes me want to yell at the sky.
This is GOLD
"Under The Hadean Moon" could be a name for a novel, but I'm not sure what it would be about...
It’s incredibly tough to anime 1 hr long video but there is very very little information. I think its not very efficient.
I’ts an incredible piece of art!! Thank you very much
This is an incredible scale of things
This video is so good, we can make religion of it.
Wow
Eow
If the time scale in this video is 1 second = 1.5 million years, then the entire Human Era would be condensed into the last 0.008 seconds of this video. If you were watching at 60 fps, all of humanity would be in 1/2 a frame.
It's crazy that life was able to start so early in such a hostile environment. It really makes you wonder why we don't see life everywhere in the universe. I wonder if the Moon also had life but it died out when the atmosphere and water disappeared.
Man, TOOL really outdid themselves with this music video.
This deserves 4.5 billion views for effort
I´m at a 100m years and I think I know what's coming
Great job as usual, good luck improving further(or to anyone reading this)!
definitely one of the best videos in YouTube, if not the best
Damn i watched the whole Hour. Great work! And i missed our Part, cuz i took one sip of water xD
I'm in tears, so astonishing, have no words... well sometimes the music and landscapes reminded me SNES Donkey Kong Country
Copium ppl gonna cope instead of acknowledging that 98% of viewership cant handle five minutes of this boring-ass side scroll
Now we need to wait another 4.5 billion years for another episode 🙄
Time-constrained information, yay! Because why not explain in proper rhythm when you can disrespect anyone wanting access to easy knowledge by making them listen to a couple beats - soooo game changing LOL
It is astonishing how quickly simple life emerged on Earth but equally astonishing that it took so very long for more complex life to take hold. This must tell us something about the sorts of life we’re likely to find elsewhere in the universe.
The sun is a deadly lazer
It's hard to grasp how this concept passed through your meetings and got approved in the first place. How  do managers and directors allow this misuse of man-hours is beyond comprehension
Amazing video
when will scientists ever actually prove earth is 4.5 billion years old?? (they never will because it isnt even close to that old)
seeing life appear only in the last quarter of earth's history was mind blowing
Should be made mandatory in schools ❤
Clickbait! This is exactly 1 hour and 11 seconds, not just 1 hour! I didn't pay for lies, unsub! /hj
Incredible
This is fucking insane, I'm in my 4th year of med school and I usually study for a couple hours. Definitely gonna add that to my playlist, thank you so much!
Again, an absolute Masterpiece of art! Thank you sooo much for providing us with such incredible videos!
Propaganda. I know that Earth is 6000 years old, and pyramids are purple and cows are flat.
this is a cinematic masterpiece!
Best study background music ever! 😝😝😝
it's just still unreal to grasp the idea that we're living on a 4.5 billion years old rock floating infinitely in an infinite universe that has zillions of similar rocks. We're too irrelevant and trivial and tiny.
Will watch more than once ❤
Loved this video.  Would be very interested in seeing videos about how water initially formed on Earth, and a visualization of how the early super continents formed.
Imagine if this animation was a mural on a really long wall. It would be a bit of an eye opener to many when they get to the end and see that humans barely make it on the end.
Thank you.
Earth just existing Life: "Don't mind if I do"
I think I heard a Terraria song somewhere? 🥴
is that the one fish from half life 1 at 55:44?
SO AMAZING OH MY GOD, love from Brazil, we all love your channel!
Um actually the earth is flat and was made by god in seven days and is the center of the universe: 🤡
At 45:26 every beat is 1 million years
Thanks is all I can say..
waiting for an hour of human history now
One things for sure, a mass extinction is coming for us sooner or later
Is there a way to make this available in youtube music, so I can listen to this while driving ?
Solange Carvalho? 🇧🇷?? 😮😮
Cool idea, but there's too many points where nothing is happening.
Bro, Pat yourself on the back. Just wow, you are the men. That was something I didn't know. I needed so much. And I sat through it and watched it all in one go very cool
This is the dumbest idea ive ever seen, I cant stress enough how boring this content is
im studying to this master piece, its inspirational
And gta 6 stoll hasn't come out
", I guess" at the end of the title is the only thing missing
Bravo. Unbelievable.
There's a bit of animation error at the Neoarchean section that I noticed, the floating bits in the foreground repeat in an unclean way, first the right side cuts, then the left side.
10:38 meteorite just went into the backrooms
Epic Mountain out here killing it for a full hour <3
This is so good for one hour I can't belive it
the music was on point
What's the name of the song towards the end?
👏👏Well done for sticking with us for 10 years!👏👏
cudos, kurzgesagt. this is awesome. be proud of what you did here and in so many other videos.
I am just in love with the sound track. Trance is such a niche genre to begin with and showcasing up front and center is just ❤❤❤
This is soooo amazing and the insane thing is that it is all free. 👍
Y'all need to give the music and animation guy a raise
Absolutely amazing video. Thank you so much once again kurzegesagt! Great information and voice over and art and animating!
I use this as background for SO many things, such a great idea !
for 15 or 20 years you could do the entire universe, then mix this in at the end
Fucking Spectacular!!! 👏👏👏
45:00 So 1.2 billion years is literally "old as fuck"
that would be fun in VR
Peloarchean music reminds me of Boards of Canada. Mesoarchean reminds me of Tool.  Love all the different music for each era. Good stuff.
This video is so humbling. When you look into the vastness of how old the earth is,  and even the universe, our petty squabbles on earth become meaningless in the grand scheme of it. It's such a shame that evil exists in this world... with international scientific cooperation we could expand into the stars instead of spending money on killing each other.
Found an 86,000 word fanfic PUFF (my cat who’s keeping me company because I’m sick), I KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TODAY
What is weird is why it took life so long to show up on Earth...
Each story this team tells always keeps me going with optimism in science, It's allowed to be simplified without removing too much information. Its truly what I appreciate about kursgesagt!
i would be interested what the watch time of this video is from the 4 mio people
Love it <3
this really didnt need to be as long as it was. if it was like photoedited not cartoonish, id get it... but like 80% of it is just the same images on rotation.  It should be either cut down (i.e. 100 mil years per second) or done in photorealistic way....  Looking at the comments here, i guess im the only one who thinks this way. Since this is Kurzgesagt, id expected more
Rocks glitch around 29:42
Is this music on spotify?? I would love to just listen to the music when I'm studying sometime
Honestly I think it's safe to say this is one of the most fascinating videos you can come across on YouTube simply because it gives you a rough idea of our complete history whilst also being relaxing and therapeutic. The animation team have done an amazing job ❤
19:23 yooo is florida sometimes! had to say this I’m stuck in bed because I’m sick
Did you just animate a feature film? =O
I feel spiritual wonder when I watch this. We take _so much_ for granted in our fleeting lives. It does my heart good to appreciate just how amazing it is that I get to be a living human being on the earth at this point in its long history!
I think the most time consuming task on the making of this video was making 1hr of original music.
👇🏻people who watched the entire video without skipping-
Made a 2 year old watch it. Managed to hold on for about 20 minutes! 21:04
This is very cool, but it would have been great to see some side pannels showing the earth as seen from space, and maybe a showcase of emerging lifeforms
1h is to short. Where is the realtime version? I would watch it twice!
How in the world is this information collected? How do scientists create such a detailed account?
Not an expert here: If photosynthesis started in late Paleoarchean, how come there was no oxygen in the atmosphere during the Mesoarchean? Unless photosynthesis at the time worked differently than today? Or unless the oxygen was stuck in water? One would think over 100 million years, there would be plenty of O2 in the atmosphere.
I’ve never liked or subscribed before because I’ve been too lazy. But this video made me change that. Thank you for your effort!
Man i think the universe age is more probable. It coukdve been flooded with water, i have no aggenda i just am a skeptic.
Could this be made into a side scroller game?
I hope, after seeing the beginning of the video, more people gain appreciation of what a paradise our world has become compared with what it could've been.
I got a basically nice girl ad talking about how “bigger is always better” and an obviously fake “watch the sca-VIDEO now!!!” to “lengthen your jhon.” I’m 11.
Thanks for this❤
Whoever made the floor is lava track is genius
I slept so well. Thank you Kurzgesagt. Now rewatching it.
I would like more comentary on the mentioned events but it was cool anyway
Thank you for making this
Damn, they should make live wallpaper out of this!
The sounds track is pretty epic 🎉🎉
There should be a version without voiceover for weird parties
Crazy to think how "alien" & hostile Earth would have been to us for most of its existence. So many factors, accidents & improbabilities to attain this Goldilocks zone.🥰 And we're turning the planet against ourselves. 🤑🤯😰
This video should be required viewing as a part of every Historical Geology course in existence.  The immersiveness and real sense of the scale of earth history time, as well as the causes and effects of great changes - the great oxidation event, little issues like the advent of CO2 causing the earth to cool by decreasing the greenhouse gas methane, the catastrophic changes at extinction events, the ebb and flow of hospitability of the planet through such transitions as the snowball earth, and the relative wink of an eye during which multicellular life has existed bring perspective in the span of one lecture hour that many semester-long courses cannot - mired as they are in detail.  A wonderful and insightful undertaking - a time machine in which we can all ride.  Kudos to all involved in its creation.
hats off to the team behind this video.
watch at .6 speed custom (you will not regret it.)  That's about the limit of where it becomes janky at slower speeds.
This honestly feels like a huge remix and the narrator occasionally steps in for a few lines before the beat drop.
Hah, im so interested in alien biology, world building and Evolution that i watch the whole thing without doing anything else in the meantime xP
I'm only 2:22 minutes in and I already love this video with my whole heart.
At which point could humans survive on Earth , if they could go back in time?  I'm talking before before hunger became a factor.
HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY!
I knew humans were going to appear late. I didn't realise they were going to be the last tenth of a second.
in four day theres already 3 million views
@kurzgesagt DO MORE LIKE THIS FUCK YEEEAH
31:01 so cozy
In case anyone is searching for that amazing last soundtrack, starting at 55:50, it's "dino discovery" in kurzgesagt vol 8 by epic mountain. It's not in the album for this video. Phenomenal job on this project kurzgesagt, I love you guys!
At around the 13:12 mark, you can see a glimpse of a TARDIS flighting about; Swarm had just been locked away at Burnished Rage battleground for all of eternity
This is a very amazing video.
History of the entire world ig
Can you create one for History of mankind and different civilizations since the dawn of men?
Now make a 1000 hours version of the history of Universe please!
Great that we made it to the final cut eventhough we had this less screen tiem.
You can't just talk about giant asteroid hitting earth sometime during Orosirian period, leaving the largest crater known - and NOT show it!
I will never look at a rock the same way again
The music for the Mesoarchean sounds a bit like Tool \m/,
57:53 good music transition
fav part 59:42 :)
❤
This is probably their most ambitious product yet. Thank you so much for your time! It's so hard to understand that this was our planet all those years ago...
Holy this is so fantastic 😱 love the concept so much and pleeeease tell me I can listen to that music somewhere 🔥🔥🔥 all love from Australia ♥️
Best lofi video on yt
29:43 there is a bug in the rendering, the rocks go all crazy
The Mesoarchean portion is giving me some real Doom Eternal vibes and I'm fine with this.
I absolutely love you guys. Thank you for all the amazing work you do!
I was draming at same time XD
This deserves so much more recognition, this video was amazing! Not once during the entire hour did I feel like clicking away
If time is irrelevant according to Einstein then it took me a billion years to finish my popcorn while watching this mesmerizing video
Almost 27 minutes in, and almost 2 billion years later, still watching at normal speed all the way through. Videos like this are what make me so happy to be a supporter through merchandise!
Nice BIT.TRIP BEAT vibes, diggin' it!
Wow I know what I'm doing the next hour at work
Great video! Thank you! For me it also solves Fermi Paradox - we are able to see into space for 0.00013s (200 years) in 1 hour video.
If only there wasn't an annoying tiktok shop and temu ad every 2 mins...
Such a fascinating video! If there's ever an idea for a second "X years in 1 hour", I'd love to see one centered around known human achievements and history
This cartoonish animation fits as an illustration to a video. But here the visual would have been important. This quality is not enough.
What a marvel! Sounds like the Tonian age brought us Tool. :D
Is this the new "history of the entire world, i guess"?
Can we have a version without commentary? 🙏
Greta should watch this and get some fucking perspective  She's just deleted a 2018 tweet saying humanity would fall by 2023
1 hour long? Gonna be played in so many school classes….
Lo Fi Beats to Develop Life To
What I learned from this video is that the earth is flat
It would have been really cool if there was a counter in top left or right corner that indicated the average global temperature and avg oxygen % in the atmosphere
A one hour long In a Nutshell video? What is this?! I am in absolute heaven! 😭😍
The fact that we have access to such information for free is just incredible
Congrats for the effort of animating this incredible short film!! And props to the amazing soundtrack. A mixture between Eletronic, Heavy Metal and Prog Rock! Mainly here --> 47:30 Sounds a lot like Tool or Dream Theater
in frensh pleaaase <3
Great video! I appreciate what you've done! Marvelous!
Wow, that was magnificent. It was exciting too, because I roughly knew what was going to happen so when bubbles start forming I was like O2 TIME! And then ofc the extinctions etc. I loved this
26 minutes in and I'm already mind-blowed of the possibility of my existance. Great job!
This kind of ressource is priceless to me, because even though I understand how short humanity's time on earth has been, I have a hard time visualising how old the earth truely is, especially when I do some geological research
*Big Bang and Evolution starting from the water:* "Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were one mass then We split them apart? And We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" — Quran 21:30  We built the heaven with might, and We are certainly expanding it. — Quran 51:47  How could a desert man 14 hundred years ago know that? You may say it's a guess work or a flock, but there're more impossible hints in that book.  *Origins of iron:* “And We also sent down iron in which there lies great force and which has many uses for mankind…”  - Quran 57:25  The Quran seems to imply that the iron was something “sent down” and not from this earth, an idea not foreign to 20th century science.   *Origins of water:*  When the comets enter our atmosphere the heat generated on entry vaporizes this ice into the atmosphere. The Christian Bible says that God created water directly on Earth, however the Quran didn't do this mistake instead it says that God sent down water from outer space  "In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind; *In the water which Allah sent down from the Heavens and brought with it life to Earth after being dead and gave life in it to every kind of land animal;* And in directing the winds; And in the clouds that are enslaved between the Heavens and the Earth; [All these] are Signs for a people who comprehend." - Quran 2:164
This video is a banger through and through  Btw how's the camera lasts that long? what kind of technology the camera has? And who is the cameraman?
Note that this is a theory. So some people think that this is NOT how Earth forms. (Coherence Theory of Truth)
29:43 there seems to be a bug in the animation, the objects at the bottom seem to zap out of existence
amazing
The perfect ambience!
do one of human history
This video is simply amazing.
this is a masterpiece Kurzgesagt!
Next: all 13.8x10^9 years in one hour.
Thanks for sharing this amazing knoledge with us. Is incredible what we as human beings can do in such a short period of time.
The Bible has left the chat
I guess that next one could be the evolution from old apes to us in 1 hour, or maybe all the history from year 1 to year 12025 in 10 hours. And I'll definitely be there to watch them.
we want such a video for future 4.5 billion years!!!!
Happy 10years project🥳
this is amazing, I'll re-watch this a million times!
Less complex than fnaf lore
Love this so much. Thank you for putting so much effort into this.
BRUH MAKING 1 hour video IS INSANE
Fantastic work! I felt at peace watching up until the Tonian for some reason, after that it felt like things shifted into gear or something like that, like peaceful eternity came to an end, dunno why it happened during the Tonian for me. Might be a cool thing to upload a version of it without music but with sounds that would be specific for each era, if there is such a thing, for immersion.
*3.9 million views* in 4 days... *abominable*
_ICT🌆7PM 15th Nov 2023_
Perfect terraria background music
Love it. Internet needs more of THIS and less of X, YouTube shorts and TikTok even though I appreciate it all
First video which is not utilizing proper  or regular shapes
I've watched this from start to finish it is very informative. Like really, i didn't know there are so many time periods. Watching life emerge from nothing is truly satisfying. 11/15/2023 19:34 thanks bird people!
Absolutely stunning work
I just knew that this will be used in schools or universities
thanks!!
This entire video reminds me of the movie 'Evolution'!
Incredible experiment !  Well done :)
Love the channel and educational artworks the team of Kurzgesagt creates. I would love to give this to my kids, but their native language is Dutch. Is it possible you have an expert translate the most popular posters and infographs and present them in another language then English?
Play this track at my bloody funeral!
The effort man
1 hour of animation is insane and also its free!
4,5 billion years old and 3,9 Billion views
i saw someone online using an ai voice model on your narrator to narrate the paris catacombs
It was the perfect video to clean my desk and sort my documents. Thanks!
What if we saw the Earth as a 4.5 billion year old work of art, and we get the privilege of living in it? :)
hands down one of the best channels on this platform. it's been so fun watching you guys grow over the years, keep up the amazing work!
Humans - 1million years and gone. Good by Greta Thunberg.
no one is noticing that the mossy rocks in the siderian era look like dinosaurs
By far the most beautiful thing to exist on YouTube.
I'm proud to say that I watched to whole video without pausing.💓
thank you upload!this is Japan! i always watch this channel and learn science!if u can add subtitle of japanese,i will be happy😊
Awesome 🙌
huh
Thanks Kurzgesagt, you guys are awesome! Such a good video. Well done animations, top quality as always
Impressive. Now cut earths history into 30 minutes
This is amazing! How can you watch this and not think that there is some sort of higher power.. Evolution from this all the way to create humans with eyes, ears a mouth... laptops where I can watch and comment on something.. the universe is incredible.
It’s actually just over an hour
Bill Wurz did it better.
An hour????? Shit I need some time 😅😅
Simply astonishing. Hands down the best animation science educators and creators in YouTube. Here’s to your next ten successful years you awesome people.
Nice but some feedback: Narrator comments could appear more often and talk more in a "scientific" way
Respect to the camera man that recorded all that all those years ago
this should be in the paid section of youtube. great animation, simple explanation, accuracy of the information, wallpaper-able video is crazy
To manage an illustration of *4.5 billion years* in one video and have the animations flow so smoothly is something to truly be proud of
Fantastic video! What an ambitious project :D
This is an incredible video! I can't imagine all the work you put into it. Thank you so much!
why is his voice somehow so calming
came to see the entirety  of earths history stayed for the music.
2/10 halfway through still not at multicellular life :(
You guys are incredible! I'd also love version without the dialog, to just have running in the background :)
You guys always post quality content, thank you so much for all the videos
Might wake many.
since 2019! wow, this video is 5 years old?
At this time were approaching 4M views and still wondering, thinking who watched this video childrens  or a grown man like me.
Eated the full video right up and I'm gonna do it again rn.
amazing!
It would have been nice if they said more facts about the era to keep people watching
This music would fit a kirby game.
Ooooo
I'll paid good money to witness all of history through a moving galaxy train!!
Ross would appreciate this!!
This video should reach that 4.5 Billion views
This whips. The music, the animation, the general vibe. Immaculate.
Everybody is saying (this took so long) when a lot of it is looping animation
Thank you, this helped me pass my history exam
whole video is a musical bop
You created a movie that deserves a Palme d'Or
This is a great shroom comeup vid !
Loading -------- Installing Humans.exe... Installation complete, removing backup folder...
Thank you
WOW, I'm out of words... Kurzgesagt, you are genuinely amazing.
So did animals from Jurassic era survive or did everything go?
This kinda reminds me of Jeff Wayne’s war of the worlds.
I can't help but read this as a eulogy, given current climate policy :(  But it also gives me new motivation to protect life on earth 💚
I think we humans are also just an experiment of life, whether it fits harmoniously with everyone else or not. Like everyone else before us, we will survive, or we will die. We are currently seeing the trend clearly.  One thing is certain, the earth continues to rotate, for many millions of years.  Thank you for this insanely long, beautiful, impressive, educational and entertaining video. It’s your best so far.  And now I have to buy something in your shop so that you can continue making beautiful videos. 😁
It's rubish but interesting
Stupid and very inacurate waste if time
CHALLENGE!! WHERE IS GOD IN THIS VIDEO?? Can anyone, who believes in GOD or RELIGION, give an explanation about the presence or work of GOD in this entire video??
And then a man came and decided to screw everything possible.
Nice music btw
Not accurate I didn't see Queen Elizabeth ONCE
Okay, but Bill Wurtz got the speedrun in sub-20
the cameraman never dies o7
I cant stop watching this haha
This is the longest, most dialogue-sparse thing I’ve watched in years, maybe ever, where I haven’t once had the urge to pick up my phone.   Indescribably stunning. Thank you so much, Kurzgesagt team.
The most absurd video representation I've seen wich is not even true 😂
1 hr of Kurzgesagt for free's gotta be ilegal
Not only was the animation amazing but some of the music during this was really good too
Making a 1 hour animated video is one thing, also adding entertaining and engaging music to match Damm!  Came for the video and stayed for the music, anyone??
XQC will react to this
I blinked and missed all of human history
I wanted to hear more of your voice :). Thanks for the video.
0:45 Earth collision with Theia is not a proven fact, it is simply the most popular thesis on what created the moon.
Guys I don’t know if you know this but they can repeat animations 🤯
I'm only 4 minutes in and I'm LOVING this music. Bangin'.
bill wurtz did it better
so billions of years just for humans to exist so we can slave at a 9 to 5 job... damn humanity wut are we doin
45:00 my man Bangiimorpha pubescens invents sex 1.2 Billion years ago People 1.3 Billion years ago: 😩
USE HEADPHONES FOR BEST EXPERIENCE
Never felt so small as I did during that last second of video. Amazing project. If you'll excuse me, I need to go existential crisis now
What I learned today: The Mesoarchean period had not much going on, but the music was fire.
It can't get any better than this! It completely astonishes me how much effort Kurzgesagt puts in just for us. Thank you so much!
I love that we live in a day and age where information like this is available, but also have people that say dinosaurs didn't exist because of a book about an invisible sky-daddy.
Masterpiece. Thank you again  Kurzgesagt.
Thank you!
They should put this up in a science center exhibit to play on repeat all day for everyone to watch.
Jesus loves you
-the first cell with a nucleus "a big moment for humanity" -the invention of sex "not much is going on"  Kurzgesagt, never change
This is the perfect video to have on the background while doing some work
Next do all of human history
Been done 1000'a of times already. So cringe
This make a great screensaver.
Comment what your favorite period was. You can choose 2 or 1.
29:42 visual glitch on cyanobacteria rocks
Whoa. This brought a whole new perspective to our current issues. Mother earth truly has seen it all. Humans might not fare too well but mother earth will go on.
This was freaking beautiful. I loved all of this. Reminds me of the VSauce video that ended with like a minute of Earth b-roll footage encompassing the same message, sparing just like two frames for all of humanity.  It makes one wonder, though. What comes in the next hour?
I didn't know there was a glitch on earth around 2352 million years ago 🤯
It’s crazy to think that 99.996% (not an exaggeration) of that last 2 seconds of “all human history” is just humans clanging rocks together and ooga booga.
it’s crazy to think that humans figured this all out
Thank you Kurzgesagt, for a great 1-hour melodic trance rave set with outstanding visuals. lol.
19:40 tool type beat yall gettin groovy
so even life itself was just a material issue then. we are merely an interaction demanding to progress into the next phrase. the whole thing is just a screenplay and we can do nothing about it. even if we create planets or manipulate ecosystems, everything is futile and eventually, inevitably localized. this is just boring. just as anything else in this whole universe. either do your best or do nothing, it does not matter in the big picture.  you can only alter your own experience. and maybe a few others around you.
Pleeeasseee make it in french VO 🙏
Amazing work as always!
It also reminds us why it’s so difficult to find life out in the cosmos.    Like photographing a single spark millions of miles away
it took 4 year to make that underwhelming video
this is why we need to become multiplanetary. an insurance policy to those damn extinctions.
I was watching this video yesterday night when I took off my glasses and I was so tired so when the lava rocks at 7:28 came I thought they were fire turtles💀
When I thought will we get any 1 hour video ever from Kurzgesagt boom here we have this!!! Love every moment of this video
life uhh finds a way : Dr. Ian Malcolm.
I am not used to this type of stuff in Kurzgesasgt  It is a new experience for me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Should I do shrooms to this !?
This was amazing video  it was interesting I know how long it takes anime maybe in the future you can do it with humans since we're just now hitting in the evolution of technology
Just imagine. Humans were able to find out about the first first first day the earth was born till now in 4.5-4.6 billion years. And they took years to do it. While here it was done in 1 hour. ♥ pure amazingness. I probably aced history.
1792 billion years ago is giving twin peaks
Captivating! i love this channel. Can i get the soundtrack from this video? SO good.
You have no idea how fucking beautiful this video was to me. This past fall, I have been taking a biology course in college and for those who don't know, the wonderful birbs of this channel were very freaking thorough in the making of this video. To see how the earliest protist developed towards becoming eukaryotes as some of the earliest protist, then getting the foreshadow of the soon-to-be rise of invertebrates as a moment was given to the earliest fungi (both invertebrates and fungi came about around the same time from the opisthokonta branch of unikonta protists), to then revealing so much more. Don't even get me started on the bryophytas towards the vascular monilophytas, and the earliest gymnosperm (coniferophyta) and angiosperms (those fancy-looking red flowers with what seemed to have had several stamens.)  What I am trying to say in this long-winded nerd-gasm is that Kurzgesagt has made me so god damn happy to be an environmental science major and I can only wish them the best going forward from their 10 years; happy anniversary you guys!!!
44:52 WHAT
55:08 Props to Epic Mountain for the clever re-use of the theme from "Dino Discovery" as heard in "What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like" <3 god I love this
So I have a few comments and questions, you said there was an ice age spanning a few million years out of nowhere and then it subsisted, but all the other periods were still intensely hot,  also water seemed to come out of nowhere, where did it come from if the entire planet was co2 and lava, I assume water evaporating must have caused such an intense cooling effect and then something must've happened to heat the earth back up again, maybe that asteroid you talked about later.
😢 Thank you so much for this work of art!
we gotta stop all these pointless wars and focus on the future :(
best video on youtube
amazing.....
The only way to cure my existential crisis is for Kurzgesagt to make the entire history of human civilisation video in 1 hour 😂 Thanks guys, love your stuff. I use your video to teach undergrad immunology
Someone was left to cook when making the music😂
Impressive work of art. Both visually and auditory. Hats off!
29:43 I am error?
1:00:50
How come no one is acknowledging this banger soundtrack??
For scale, this video moves at 15 times the estimated existence for our species in one second.
29:43 there appears to be a glitch in the video, or possibly an encoding error. No disrespect! I love it so much that I've been watching and listening intently for nearly 30 minutes straight now!
and mans hubris, love and war and creations are fleeting in this vast time, space and endless sea like single snowflake in a vast endless desert
human is the latest to come to the world and most certainly be the only one who would destroyed ourself
This is so nice of kurzgesagt to show the whole time they've been recording the universe and earth and that all compressed to a single one hour video
imagine an intelligent species instead of collectively reaching a common goal of development is now divided by boundries and is fighting the war on behalf of imaginary fictional figures and killing itself.
the scale and awesomeness of this video can be predicted in a few early minutes of the video.
As insignificant as Kurzgesagt videos may make you feel, especially this one we've just all enjoyed together. I think this video also presents a perfect opportunity to recognize how even the smallest seemingly insignificant actions taken can have unimaginably profound effects when given the opportunity to amplify through equally unimaginable scales of time. Take that original single celled prokaryotic cell that decided randomly at one point, to take in another unimpressive cell but not eat it and instead form something of two cells. In the instant it happened and even for the millennias after it happened, we would not recognize any significant impacts it had on the planet; yet through the timescale of the Earth, that moment could not have been less integral to our existence today and the existence of everything around us. What you do on a day to day basis may feel tiny and unimportant in present, but who knows what chain of events may eventually occur originating from any of your accomplishments; be it a scientific discovery, or just putting your left shoe on first, your potential to influence the next 4.5 billion years will always be oppositely proportional to the certainty that you will do some seemingly insignificant things <3
Please make more of these to study to!
Amazing Movie!
Music reminds me of Rufus du sol. Amazing video, great job.
they had one hell of a cameraman for this documentary...
this might be my favorite video you've made, thank you
I wanted to wait until I had a chance to sit down and watch this video in its entirety - I know you said we could watch these things in the background, but that just doesn't do your stuff justice, and boy am I glad I waited. I'm many things...a music lover, a space nerd, a fan of your videos...and MY GOD, this an audiovisual treat the likes of which Hollywood can only DREAM of creating. This needs to be shown to EVERYONE, absolutely everyone on the planet needs to see this, and if they're not immediately in love with our fragile blue jewel, well, perhaps their humanity should be questioned! LOL I kid, but not about the quality of this video. The only other piece that's made my soul and imagination soar, on the sheer quality and composition of the audio alone, was Ivan Torrent's Human Legacy. This absolute magnum opus is a treasure for the eyes, ears, and mind, but more importantly, it's a balm for one's SOUL. In a period where people are fired up, angrier than ever, and the world is groaning under all of that sadness and pain, You, Kurzgesagt, are always there with a dose of education, knowledge, and in this, you provide a unifying force that we so desperately need.  While watching this, especially as you began to uncover the later eras and epochs of our planet, suddenly I was transported back to 1998, when the PBS channel was the primary source of entertainment with shows like Kratt's Kreatures and Bill Nye the Science Guy, and the MECC edutainment games held the crown for scientific learning and education. I felt like I was suddenly roving the halls of Museum Madness again, uncovering the secrets of the universe and bringing dinosaurs back to life in the exhibits!  You folks have a storytelling GIFT, and I thank you for sharing it with us throughout the years.
Obviously this isn't true, but still rather interesting
Ambitious !
Surprised nobody is talking about the banger music we had for the past hour, feels like I'm playing an awesome indie game that is a breath of fresh air.   Thanks for such an amazing passion project Kurzgesagt!
why tell us about the worlds biggest crater structure and no animate the rock hitting us
Just beautiful 😊
when is the lofi study music channel coming?
This video should be shown to every kid in kindergarten.
The music is FANTASTIC
Never expected it is a full album. Perfect for a insane lengthy video.
it's 1 in the morning, what am i doing?
This is beautiful
I can't even begin to imagine how much time and effort you guys put into this, but thank you so much! I had a wonderful time watching, learning, and taking in the scenery :)
Loved it! Music, animation, concept, all of it! I teach high school and I’m going to put this on next time my students have an hour of work time in class.
i'm glad the Hadean phase moon is really animated and not just a loop!
one of the thermal vent rocks looked like a confused blob monster.
❤
cool
This brought me to tears, thank you for reminding us how much has died and evolved and suffered to get to this point. Life truly is a glorious thing
didnt watch, bill wurtz did it better.
I need this video's sound track because those were some banger toons.
okay but when the music kicked in I WAS VIBING!
I was listening to this amazing 1 hour video while studying in my room. Although I didn’t look at the actual video often, the music is the one that helped me calm down and focus.
Tbh this is less learning than it is a study soundtrack lol
This is AMAZING. Thank you to the team for not only putting this content out, but doing it for free. Absolutely 🔥 job guys. 👏
Beautiful vibrant visuals. My fav portion of audio was during the Cretaceous era. Thank you!
This is one of my most favorite videos ever. Thanks for the years of work Kurzgesagt! I'm sure the team was thrilled to finally get this live!
flat earthers:  see? told you it was flat.
I love the Jurassic Park callout:  "Life... uhh... finds a way"
I dont have money, but thanks for the content, i only can give sub and like
44:53 NO WAY THE SEX UPDATE
Love how life evolved in baby steps with vast quantities of time between. Although the steps were small, it feels like life was so persistent to advance and become the intelligent life there is today. I also love how life has been a product of the environment. One of the most fascinating videos I've seen on YT. Thank you for this
So cool!
I absolutely love this channel, their content is literally unmatched
The Hadean era is the longest and most bland era.
45:00 thanks lil buddy🙏🏿
I'm only 4 minutes in and it's already epic.  Masterful!
So well done!  What a wonderful and unique experiment.
This is the best video on YouTube.
This was the best hour spent watching anything ever made by any human in history. THANK YOU 🙏 💕 🤩
when does joe biden
1 hour and 3 minutes of time was just very well spent
Man the music is astonishing we are so lucky thanks 🙏
DUEL?
the music did not have to fuck so hard for something so existential
Increíble ❤
oh man I can't believe my homework took 4.5 Billion years, I thought the teacher only assigned an hour...
Pro-tip for Edge users on Windows 11:  1. Right-click twice on the video for the browser's contextual menu to pop-out. 2. Select "Picture in picture" 3. Enjoy the video while working on other things.
This is truly one of the best channels in youtube!
Such a cool video to watch and rewatch several times! Thank you so much for making this!
You have really out done your self I’ve been here since 1.2mil and this one I can’t imagine how much time it took. Take a moment to realize how far you’ve come!
The music was great also. Good job team.
If you want the full effect of Hadean, try putting some frozen food to cook and sit back
This is 40,296,000,000,000 hours of history condensed into just a 1 hour video.
The music kind of slaps
Can't believe I sat here and watched the entire hour in one sitting. Did not feel like that long at all. It was really funny, knowing from the very beginning that human[ity] -civilization- would last for only a second, or less, of the full hour. Absolutely crazy.  Also it's awesome how basically every frame of this video would make a great wallpaper. The illustrators and animators did a wonderful job bringing the idea to life in an interesting way.  (Edit: Human civilization wasn't represented in the hour, so I struck that out. Human civilization started much more recently, as Silent Hawk Studios noted in a reply to this comment).
I just attended a 4.5 billion year rave and I still have to go to work in the morning.  Happy 10th kurzgesagt🖤
Round of applause for the cameraman for time traveling and mastering immortality just for the sake of this video! 👏👏👏
@kurzgesagt so, I bought a bunch of posters. They were delivered last week (finally)! Although the posters are of very high quality, I was disappointed because they looked very DULL; paled in comparison to the images or videos online. I had really hoped they would be as bright n vibrant as your amazing digital artwork 😢
3.8 million views on nonsense that is all lies?? good job creator, keep fooling the masses. FOOL
Sat through the entire thing and was left with all sorts of emotions. I had a cerebral understanding of how infinitesimally short humankind has existed in relation to the earth, but that blink-and-you-miss-it moment really puts it into perspective.
I know a guy that did the same in under 20 minutes
Increíble!
1:00:00 hey wait this music sounds... familiar...
It's pretty cool to see how much we've built in 5000 years compared to the huge amount of time the Earth has been existing, can't help but wonder how will everything look like in 10,000 years in the future if we don't destroy ourselves. (Or get destroyed? 👽)
one of my favorite videos ever!!!!
This earth is only 6000 years old.
I wish I could get this as a wall paper for my computer
Cell disappears  🤣 25:21
Love the vids, always brings joy seeing these pop up!
I can't imagine the workflow for the animations. How many layers in total. This is reaaly fascinating.
Can we please take time to appreciate this banging Magnum Opus of a soundtrack? Such a great vibe.
8:59 Ah yes, green water. The water back then was so densely filled with bacteria that it was green (I think that's how it goes anyway)
I thought this was going to be something similar to Bill Wurtz' "History of the entire world, I guess", but this was nice, too
1:35 - The Floor is LAVA!
Watching this video all the way through really drives home the beautiful insignificance of all human life.
Speechless, as a geology major myself I'm very impressed and it is truly amazing to see all the efforts you guys put in since 2019 and not giving up on the project. I really hope this will give incentive to people to go in Earth sciences, it is so so interesting and you would not regret understanding what you're living on right now. Also the audio for the Hadean era is magical, love it so much (as well as the rest tbf), it's just so '*interstellar*'-ish
How is this free
En español por favor!!!!
A masterpiece!
My cat jumped up in my lap and I petted it. Accidentally fell asleep in the eoarchean era and woke up a couple of million years later. Good video
Well, let's hope we last long enough to add a second of our history to this timeline. I know nothing short of a mass extinction event will stop us, no matter the state of the world, but I still occasionally think about your, "The Last Human" video.
Ha, I saw the bird you snuck in the background as an easter egg way before complex life would have occurred. I won't spoil it for anybody.
To the top comment guy who thinks this took years to animate.... its just 10-20seconds loops so in the end it's only 10minutes of animations more or less. I swear people lost the ability to think.
The fact that this Much hot and comfy
jesus
I haven’t even watched this yet, but realizing it’s over an hour long just made my entire 2023 SOOO much better 😊 let’s goooooooo!
Idk if this is right but in the scale of this video 0AD to 2023AD goes by in 1.349 ms And a human life in 0.049 ms Almost every frame at 60fps
If the video is an hour long, then our appearance would be 0.24 seconds long
Does the narrator spit at 39:53?
Problems with the video: 1. Some eras should change gradually, not instantly poof into another at their end. For example, the Hadean should have a gradual lessening of the lava and meteors, not this instant change into the Eoarchean. Completely, absurdly unreal. 2. The Great Oxygen Event was fluffed over, when it was the worst mass extinction in earth's history. It should have been visible that almost all life died, and the entire planet changed color with precipitating oxides. 3. Dinosaurs aren't reptiles. "The Age of the Reptiles" is an outdated term that should have been replaced with "Age of the Dinosaurs".
You forgot the part where God made the Earth in a few days
29:43 This part freaked me out
35:36 is absolutely incredible 😭
4:46 I like the increasing hot orbital debris hitting both the primordial earth and moon as they increase in distance and gravity from each both is claiming it’s prize.
sufro que el canal en español no haya subido estos vídeos
You fools! Add a super thanks button! Now I gotta go buy a poster instead!
Amazing video. This is so fascinating. Id love to see a followup video of just humankind. From Lucy to present, showing the different ways we branched out, leading into what we are now.
damn that piano on the ending is depressing
27:47
Ah yes, finally something that took as long as it will for silksong to release. Sorry got a little off topic there
45:00 i believe this is the most important invention in history for our weiner
Every 60 seconds in Africa, 90,000,000 years passes. Together we can stop this. Please spread the word. Thank you for your attention.
the soundtrack is fire throughout
Absolutely loved this video. I’d love a series about all the little facts that were mentioned in this like the worlds first natural nuclear reactor? Sounds so interesting
I'm on rewatch #8 (I think) and I just realized the moon really does back away throughout the Hadean. I love this video so much! Anyone saying it was boring or whatever has totally missed the point, this is a masterpiece
God I love this channel
Props to the cameraman for time travelling 4.5 billion years in the past to record this.
Dinosaurs didn't die 65 million years ago
The Sondtrack you're looking for is "Submarine Time Machine" by Epic Mountain.  Superbly atmospheric while at the same time a brilliant EDM track.
Music sounds a lot like N'to or other French artist (Woralks? Joachim Pastor? Stereoclip or Joris Delacroix?). Totally awesome - I love it.
When's the next update?
By far one of my favorite videos yet. Really puts the timescale into perspective
This is Art.
My son and I agreed that some of the music is Tool inspired. We approve.
This is amazing
Now do it with human history!
What a wonderful animation! Thanks for making it!
AHAHAA THE END Love you guys so much, words cannot express our gratitude 🙏  Also, hats off to the producers, they clearly understand the importance of music. Also the end credit music production is a nice touch 🤌 appreciate all you lots
Why i can watch this video on PiP mode without YouTube premium?
This is like being on hold, but it's not soul destroying, but educational and fun
I cant wait for AI to get advanced to the point where we could create a basically a live action version of this. Seeing in "reality" what it would've looked like so long ago in a timelapse form like this would bd amazing.
Thank you so much! Amazing video
"good job if youre still watching" Thank you
Imagine if Earth's geologic history was a canvas, not just of rocks and fossils, but of stories waiting to be told. Each layer holds tales of dramatic transformations. What if, hidden in these layers, there are messages left by ancient, advanced civilizations that existed on Earth millions of years before humans? Civilizations that rose and fell, leaving barely a trace, now buried under eons of geological change.  What if these ancient inhabitants had their own versions of dinosaurs, their own catastrophic events, and their own leaps in evolution, but their stories were wiped clean by time, leaving us as the current narrators of Earth's saga? This thought experiment challenges our understanding of time, evolution, and the fragility of civilizations. It reminds us that we, too, are just a layer in Earth's grand narrative, and it's up to us to decide what story that layer tells. Will future geologists find our layer marked by innovation and stewardship, or by neglect and downfall?  As we visualize Earth's vast geologic history, let's not just look back in awe, but also forward with responsibility. After all, we're not just inhabitants of this planet; we're its storytellers.
Me siento estafado.
You definitely must create a platform video game with these scenarios as levels, the birds as characters (with many skins to choose), and scientific information during gameplay. And with this awesome soundtrack.
Before I’ve even watched this I want to say how much I appreciate the effort that must’ve gone in to making this. I am quite humbled by the devotion of the educators that made this possible.
This is a dream I didn't even know I had come true. I will rewatch this so, so many times. Thank you.
This is better than a Tale of Us set
Incorrect. The creation of Adam and Eve was not included.
This should be shown every day in every school. And in every parlament and congress.
this video is a masterpiece
I could never grasp how the oceans were created from rain... until now. These timescales are amazing. Thank you so much for creating this.
You crazy bastards... this is a-m-a-z-i-n-g!
Probably the best Kurzgesagt video ever made. Love it so much
This music absolutely slaps
Wow
What if time-traveling aliens seeded Earth with life a few billion years ago and they're periodically checking in to see if intelligence has emerged except they can't be bothered to set the time machine for every millennium because that would be like 3 million stops, so they just check in every 25 million years or so but they didn't expect apes to go from flinging poop to destroying their own planet so fast? From their perspective, they just watched a monkey eating a bug, pushed the button for the next stop, and oh no! Everyone's dead. They're like, Oh man! It's going to take forever for these irradiated cockroaches to do anything interesting. Push the button, Frank.
O MG 🤩💕🤯 I JUST SENT THIS TO EVERYONE I KNOW - it’s out of this world fantastic!!!
Alternative title : History of Entire Earth, I Guess
We don’t deserve y’all
shout out to the camera man for risking his life to record all of this for us (jokes aside, this video is absolutely amazing)
Humans: We're the most important of all!! History: Blinks.
Masterpiece
No Skip 🫡
"The floor is lava" 1:37
Easily one of Kurzgesagt's best videos. Beautiful love letter to our planet.
58:13 Goldblum! He Goldblummed!
"Some time (2.05 billion years) ago in the Orosirian, a large asteroid hits Earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on Earth" "Where was the Earth-shattering kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth-shattering kaboom!" 😀
It’s even more amazing that this only took 6k years!
This was so great to study to! please keep posting more, loved it!
This is a really good way to memorize the Eras
Earth survived for so long, and now we’re ruining it.  We are such a stupid species.
Finally a video to watch while I eat
the hadean part is so astonishing, as a observer, it feels like you are just a tiny dust in that vast vacant space strolling for billions of years
This was incredible!
Love all of your videos guys but this tops it, appreciate the experimentation of the idea, and the music was superb!
Wow that was soo good !  I loved it !  Thanks !  Ho and the music was soo good wow !❤ Such an amazing journey, and we are part of it, thats just epic.
considering that, assuming 60 fps, all of human history is still less than half a frame's time... I think I might miss it even if I don't blink.
I keep coming back for the music
What a cool and instructive video!! Love it!
Best wallpaper ever
Second time I've watched it and damn, stop making me cry with these history videos!
alright now all of human history in a nutshell ;)
So if earth was just lava for that long… was it a star? Isn’t the sun just lava also?
An astonishing piece of work - a genuine artwork.
My favorite is mesoarchean
Thank You So Much
Thank you very, very much. I loved it so much
Not a single seconde was skipped for this awesome video, watched every seconde of it and no regret.
19:50 The DOOM music kicks in 😎
I didn't know I needed this. Thank you, really.
Thank you for that fantastic animation. Still the Best, Stay the Best, Be the Best Always! Infopropaganda Show and the other retarded trash can go to the rubbish dump for copy you guys!
Woah, this was amazing. Really puts things into perspective!!  Happy anniversary, guys!🥳
One interesting thought is how civilization doesn't even represent a single frame in this video  Written language emerged only about 5,500 years ago, and in the video, each second represents 1.5 million years. At 30 frames per second, the era from the beginning of written language to today would last approximately 0.11 frames.  Another fascinating point: this video covers 4.5 billion years. Many scientists estimate that in about 1 to 1.5 billion years, the Sun's increasing brightness is expected to cause a runaway greenhouse effect on Earth, leading to conditions too hot for liquid water and life to exist.  So, if the video continued, this period would be represented by another 10-15 minutes.
47:06 TOOL
We all are taught rains are formed due to the water cycle, water evapoarates from the ocean into the clouds and rains back into the ocean. Then how come in the Eoarchean period it rained for centuries?  Where did that water come from?
interesting concept, music was god-awful, not even bearable
If this video took 5 years to make, in fractions of a second, how much time would that represent on the scale of 4.5 billion years =1 hour? It should be simple math but even with the help of AI my head is spinning trying to figure this out.  This is really a great video!   I wish I had room on my wall for some of those posters.
37:40 Boris Brejcha is born
someone make this a wallpaper in wallpaper engine, pls
31:41 first desert rock
MASIVE THANKS For he awsome music. Hypnotic
Wow... This.... Is... Just.... I N C R E D I B L E . . .
4.5 billion....sure buddy
Amazing!! ❤
Propaganda
realtime version when
45:00 sex invention lmao
Please make a video in This stile especificaly about human history maybe a decade or century per second
I didn't see apes turning into men, too bad
19:45 first djent
Apparently water could not exist without oxygen. Where did the water come from? Nearly midnight, prob had 1 too many j’s haha would love to hear insight tho.. ✌🏼
the music is AMAZING
i think this is the best video i´ve ever seen
whoops I blinked
So this is what happens when science and art and a great load of creativity get together in a blender. Such a beautiful work there, this is what YouTube and the Internet exist for, what we in our times have the privilege to create and appreciate.
Greatest video ever made on youtube and possibly one one of the better everywhere.
This Chanel is INSANE….. thank god I followed this Chanel ever since 2019….. they changed a lot…..
Bill Wurth still did it better.
I now have a feeling for how long each era of the Earth lasted and vaguely when big events happened, thanks
It would have been nice to have more facts, but I suppose it is a nice video nonetheless
20:00 epic music
Should do one for human life
You know, I have heard about this time thing before but nobody has ever done as good of a job demonstrating this!
i'll save this video when im high
Interesting that, in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't very long after predation was invented that multicellularity became widespread. Perhaps multicellularity itself isn't a hard step, but predation is?
THANKS FOR ALL OF THIS
The most beautiful story ever told
Im not gonna lie.The song during Mesoarcheon Hyped me the fuck up.I though i was in a rave party.
best line? hmm.. " the fungi reach their tubular arms out and begin to do fungi things " (iirc)
the only thing they fear is goo
Would love a version with the intro and voiceover absent.
This is just astonishing! From a perspective of someone that is currently enrolled in a PhD in Biochemistry, but also loves animation and illustration, you sure put the bar very high. The way you guys communicate science is really impressive and inspiring. I hope you see this and know that your work is inspiring me and, I believe many more people, to know more, learn more and improve. Thank you!
Just imagine being one of the 2,7 people that disliked this video. Wow
Shout out to the camera man who went back in time for this ❤️❤️❤️   But in all seriousness this is pretty cool, I recently started learning animation and it is sooooo annoying so thank you to the whole Kurzgesagt team.
They had the best music in Siderian, I was born too late :-|
Where was the Roman Empire?
Was going to watch the whole video, but nodded off and dreamt I reached the edge of the flat world. Best sleepover ever!
In 29:43 you have some corruption in video ( probably from the absurd amount of time it should take to render this). Still you manage to amaze me every single time. Loved it.
Exceptional work. Best YouTube channel hands down! Thank you for the entertainment 🙏🏻
19:00 dropped the meanest rythm and thought we wouldn't notice
I saw you hiding there archaeopteryx 🙂
I love every wory you guys do , thanks a lot !
"one hour here is sev... 4.5 billion years on earth"
The amount of change humans have caused in that last second... hhhmmmm, what does that technically make us appear to be, I wonder?  We are truly effective at whatever it is we're doing here, that's for sure.
thumbs up for the DJ playing there all these billions years!
This was a great idea I'd love more like this exploring space or a trip into the depths of the ocean the passive education that this provides along with being good background music well done to all the creators involved.
imagine being high and watching this
TIL Sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago 🤯
45:00 LFFFGGGG
This is so cool thanks
Nice use of Terraria music
This video was definitely something else, congratulations and thanks for sharing it.
at 2x mesoarchean sounds like the heaviest melodic djent album known to earth
Bravo, no more words….
Just perfect
Ah yes, the good old days. Only the real ones remember
Since 2019, damn
My new favorite video from you guys. Happy anniversary!! 💕
Poor human race. Less than 1 second of screen time in a 60-minute show. We don't even qualify as an extra in the story of Earth.
That Tonian period sounding like Tool.
This animation was so chilling, I actually slept through it last night.
It's amazing to think that if every million years was shrunk down into one second, it would take an hour to portray it, and even then, humans could not be represented in much over a single frame.
58:14  Best quote in the entire film.
Oh shit they pulled the 1 hour video
Was not expecting epic djent music
It's literally 12 in the night, I watched this all at once and got some company from a fly. The animations and art are so wonderful in every video, but the fact that this animation lasts for over an hour is just insane. This video shows well how we humans are such new creatures here, what have we missed! 🙏 Amazing work and thank you for giving all the knowledge out for free <3
This can be condensed into a 19 minute 26 second video by the way….just saying……
You made my Diwali vacation even better thanks Kurzgesagt..😊
This video is awesome, just shows us how insanely lucky and rare we are to have ever existed. To me scientific evidence shown makes me disprove gods of other religions as they are too specific and are very “human” concepts as something has to be out there for sure but there’s no way it’s a conceptually “human” god as life 100% exists on other planets. Just the existence of life in space disproves all of our human based religions and gods.
I clicked like before I even started watching.
Beautifully animated gg
it's incredible how dinosaurs were literally like a minute ago
The end is astonishing.
Geological-Scale Lo-Fi
Is there a shorter version with all text narrator says? Because this one is showing scale properly I guess, but is quite boring to watch.
Was a fun ride, chuckled each and everytime that life consistently resisted mass extinction
props to the bangiomorpha algae for inventing sex, one of the best patches for the stenian update
the animating wouldve taken so long
Complete with kicking techno track
Started in 2019...ooft. great work!
I felt everything not something, this was amazing.
I started tearing up at the Cretaceous tone shift What a masterpiece, an amazing job from all at Kurzgesagt
Amazing video!! I can only say thanks!
Small. I felt small. Was this all animated by hand?!
Sat here for an hour and watched the whole thing. Amazing for reflection :)
This video rocks!
Was watching this in my hot tub. This was so good ! The immersion was real ! Thanks for this masterpiece !
is video shows) is absolutely nothing. But it was still an hour of my life - and it's easily one of the very best hours I'v
Imagine the effort this video would have taken if they added animals.
I love how calm, but passive agressive the narrator is
Kurzgesagt making tribute to Tool in the soundtrack of this masterpiece. Amazing *-*
The Music bumpin fr💯🔥
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life and I haven't even watched it yet
Wow, what a great electronic music album! Kurzgesagt turns out to be a great electronic music artist.
You are one of my favorite Chanel's on the entirety of YouTube
poor animators
Hey Kurzgesagt, I can’t beat the first level of your VR game 😢 is this a skill issue?
best video i ever saw in my life not gonna lie
@regenbogenvoorkelly
Happy 10 year anniversary! And thank you for a beautiful, thought provoking video <3
Cool idea, but almost all of it is highly speculative -- a fact that it fails to communicate -- and seems to contain several mistakes, so I think is has pretty poor educational value.
Forget the past
Still won't beat Bill Wurtz history of everything
You guys are absolute geniuses!
Einfach eingeschlafen 😂
Imagine watching this video when you are high.😅
I just watched this whole video, without doing anything else. Not even reading the comments or checking my phone.
Hotdog fish at 54:02
I legit play this everyday
It makes you feel so… small
History of the entire earth, i guess, if It was done by Kurzgesagt
I know you have way more english subscribers then german ones, but you’re a german channel. Could you at least upload in all languages at the same time instead of let us waiting so long for german videos? :(
5 min video in 1 hour....if you want to listen to electro music why not...
Most relaxing video this channel has ever put out.
Free History lesson
Just listening to you at night makes me sleep
Amazing music and sound design!
MEGA EPISODE!!! I'M WATCHING THE WHOLE THING, i had biology finals yesterday and chem finals tmr i think, this might help
We can all agree that the video is great! But my god that music, I was dancing the entire time along 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is absolutely one of my favourite videos on YouTube, just an hour of Earth's history backed by amazing music and occasional wonderful narration.
What is with the sound track?! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Easily one of my favorite videos on Youtube, truly amazing.
I felt such amazemend and also...kind of fear, cause of the short amount of time some times were
Cool 😮😮😮
My respect to the kurzgusegt team for making this incredible video
1 hour. Godamn.
This is actually quite moving!  Thank you for sharing this.
I was doing home work whilst watching this and when i was half way through it went: 'you've been here for 1 billion years' and i burst out laughing
please again in unreal engine 5.2
the discord notification at 54:35 is so funny
Kudos on the music. The one playing around the Cretaceous was extraordinarily fire.  Also, did you use ARK models for the dinosaurs? The ones you used look suspiciously much like them.
Amazing.
My little brother (5yo) wants to listen to this while going to sleep hahaha, thank you <33
I thought dinosaurs (and in small part mammals) mostly developed after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction since they had to compete much less over resources so some bipod species had time and space to evolve? I'm pretty sure there were no dinosaurs in the early Permian but oh well.
Is this FREE??? am i watching it for REAL??? ITS SO BEAUTIFUL... LOVE your TEAM EFFORT....❤❤👌👌
Spore это и человек эволюция может электроники , инопланетный животные на планеты эволюция. Кто умный выбрать Электроника и зерги, протоссы
Earth Genesis 1 hour ASMR
Getting hands on the Ae file for this video would be a masterclass🤯🤯🤯
Who produced the music on this? This is impeccable!
I like that the Mesoarchean period was backed by Doom music lol
I just feel so small after videos like this, and I feel a sense of belonging as well.
😮
This was so cool. It puts the history of the planet into perspective 🤯 Humans are likely a few seconds 🤯
POV: You are leaving, but your mom met a friend
There are decades where nothing happens and  weeks where decades of history happen
God is just perfect.
Tnx. 😘
Kurzgesagt, the movie
My favorite part of earth’s history was the birth of the Taco Bell breakfast taco 3.5 billion years ago apparently.
Great work
Can't believe it took 4.5 billion years for someone to make this video
Just watch this video in a large screen after a joint.
This would make for a really cool screensaver
The floor is lava IS the worlds oldest game? 😂
I am asking for may 6 year old son: When is coming the german version of this brilliant video?
Pls in german
Bringt das bitte nochmal in deutsch raus
1 hour detailed animation... Crazy
Amazing!
Im goint to make my children sit thru this video but im not sure if it'll be for a punishment or a reward 😂😂
Nice Dj set man loved it ❤ 🗿
Started in 2019?! My god!
props to the camera guy
One of the greatest art works in youtube, this is insane
Can you please make a video about white holes ? I'm really curious to know what it is
We are All made of stars…
Thanks to YouTube's Transcript option I skipped the silent boring parts
A version without talking would be nice, the music and ambient sounds are so good!
This is by far my most favorite thing you guys have ever produced.  Loved every second (1.5 million years) of it!
The last one second is the most important.
music is bopping like usual. amazing video, cant imagnie how long this took. so grateful for channels like urs
Why did the Mesoarchean music sound like doom music? XD
if they don’t make 1 billion trillion dollars from this i will be sad :(
Lo-Fi beats to terraform to
Every era: THIS MASSIVE THING TIPPED THE SCALE AND CHANGED EVERYTHING Stenian: Have you heard of fungal sex?
Wow so beautiful ❤
How was there water if there wasn’t any oxygen yet in the atmosphere?
the detail in the animation is crazy
45:00 lets go! this what I was waiting for!
Simply beautiful!
nice anmation and nice music
Shoutout to the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens for inventing sex.
nothing short of amazing as usual wit this channel.
I didn't know YouTube ads existed in the Eoarchean period. You learn evening new every day
The fact that humans only represent 1 second of this video is quite remarkable to think about.
You should do one named "13.7 billion years in 1 hour
The fact that this masterpiece is freely accessable is Just as mindblowing as its quality
Opera için almak istiyorum, hangisini tercih edersiniz?
The music is as lit as Earth in the Hadean period.
NOW THIS is special. Also (re)watched Bill Wurtz’s Entire History of the World just before this, would recommend this pairing 💯
Props for the camerman.
Downloaded for my flight back home! Amazing... I hope
The Ocean Collective would be very proud :)
looking at it all we've been very busy
I'm here for the music.
I don't believe in evolution so I don't agree with everything here, but you guys did an amazing job regardless! God bless you birbs for all you do
the vibe from 58:46 to 59:46 is immaculate
JOGOAT
WOW!!! Simply Amazing, Thank you so much to every single participant.
🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤘🤘🤘🤘🤟🤟🤟🤟🤘🤘🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤘🤘🤘🤘🤟🤟🤟🤟
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The earth is cruel. It's not kind to life. It seems like for the majority of the time earth has been inhospitable. 99% of all species that have ever lived are extinct.  What if we are very wrong to assume that earth is habitable. What if it just so happens that earth is going through a short phase where it's habitable. For it's 4.5 billion years of existence, only a few million years supported complex life, so I would argue that earth has not proved it's habitability. It's like living with a crazy uncle who displays moments of sanity every now and then. Right now my friends, we are living in that moment of sanity.
AAAARGGGHH SO Amaaaaaaaazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow so cool :l if only the earth was 4.5 B years old, Would this video actually make sense
this is literally top 5 craziest videos ive seen
Genuinely beautiful and humbling. I became almost dizzy with a kind of temporal vertigo to realize that if the video were a (mere) 3x longer the *entire history of the universe* from the Big Bang could be presented at this rate.
A missed opportunity to tell really interesting facts about the forming of earth. This feels really hollow and almost pointless to watch.
So... Anatomically modern homo sapiens, are thought to have first appeared 200,000 years ago, roughly... So...  In a video where we pretend the history of the planet is covered in 1 hour... Our 200,000 year existence is literally barely over 1/10th of a second long.  We really are just nothing in the grand picture of the universe aren't we?
videos like this are worth waiting 4.5 billion years
Absolutely amazing video! Thank you so much!
History of the entire world, i guess, animated
That was amazing
😍😍😍
"it's just a prank" the prank: 51:12
Combine that with the knowledge that in about 500 million years the sun will cook the earth because it gets hotter over time, and you have a good explanation for the Fermi paradox. I think that live is relatively common, but not civilizations. A lot of things have to go well for that.
It's like watching the TV at the TV shop with just 15% commentary and people are still liking it??
It should habe been included timelaps evaluation on species to demonestrate the speed of evolutions in last sections
this would be so nice as a live wallpaper
That was absolutely incredible. Thank you.
The lengh is insane!
this is so unreal and the attention to details man everything about this episode is totally amazing thank you so much for this
Crazy to think that 4.5 billion years can be summed up in 1h it most have been so hard to make this altougjt the attention is deserved!
adding juste bellow the year the temperature in oC would have been very nice
just wow
I felt inspired, as intended.
You know that quote? The one that goes 'we are the universe experiencing itself'? This is how it felt.
Love the BG music 🎉😮
bill wurtz did it better tbh
There's a small issue — in the first half of the eoarchean, the splash effects in the water stay motionless on the screen. Right around the half point of that age (10:40) they start moving with the rest of the terrain again.
Such an amazing work congrats to the whole team! Next in the series should be 1h video on human evolution perhaps starting 6 million years ago.  With a 3rd final video in the series with 1h video on recent human history starting 12 thousand years ago 😮🎉
They really made a whole video to have an excuse to drop the hottest tracks in kurzgesagt history
I'm grateful Kurzgesagt included a whole informative video to accompany their banger music album.
So, that point 1.2 BYA, with the Bangiomorpha pubescens algea in the Stenian, is literally "Old as F*ck"
Why don't dinosaurs have feathers 😢 Nevertheless, the video is great
'' 1.2 billion years ago in the stenian not that much is going on ''  Meanwhile they literally invented 'Sex'   It's like zoro says ' nothing happen '
This is one of the best pieces of media I have ever seen. Insane idea and execution.
Amazing Video... As always!
I felt so much wonder watching this video <3
This is my new background jam.
You have always left me yearning for more in the ten minute animations.....i wonder how i can pay for this 1 hours skit ....its too long to be free of charge
It's absolutely insane when you realize that all of human history only makes up the last fraction of a second.
Insane, thank you, we love you.
Can we all take a moment to recognise the banging soundtrack? "Ur My Crush" that plays during Rhyacian and Orosirian is so good it should probably be banned in a dozen countries.
Really annoying "muzak". Who the hell thought a home-organ  90's euro trance synth preset was a good idea? Bad at at every conceavable level .
isnt this mostly prehistory? I always thought that history starts where writing was invented
The fact that I'm half way through this video and there are still no plants is wild and mind blowing to me
Even better than Bill Wurtz video. Well done.
Why was oxygen needed for more complex life? Why couldn't life evolve with only CO2?
Only 4.5 billions kids would understand.
Are you gonna update this in a billion years?
3:50 This part is literally fire.
"The floor is lava," is canon.
I'm sorry to say but this is your worst video
Hope narrow-minded religious pricks do not find this channel. They are gonna start losing their shit.
think you could make a polish channel?
Beautiful
This is lovely! But what happened before the lava stage? How did the solar system start gathering lava rings to make planets?
I actually put it in my background, while I am studying. It's amazing work, thanks a lot ❤
Mesoarchean made me stop and make sure I wasn't listening to the ocean
this youtube channel is CIA propaganda
lies, God made us in his own image! we don't come from monkeys. This is blasphemy!
how.
after all this work, we just pollute the beautiful ocean.. so sad, i have sooooo many questions
please make that in german for the german kurzgesagt channel. that would be great video for my young cousin he would literally watch the whole video in focus
This vido is amazing! I love to use it when im studding 👍
I loved noticing all the subtle changes as the animation scrolled by 👌🙂
This video can legit be used in classes for teaching.
Things that surprised me: 1) How early simple life formed. 2) How late complex life formed. I would have expected the first step, the jump from dead chemistry to living biochemistry, to be the unlikeliest.
I need to smoke a blunt and watch this again lol
Thanks
4.5 Billion Year Rave in 1 Hour
4.5 Billion Years we want 4.5 Billion Views
Is there a version without the voice? Or at least a music version of this? This is excellent background audio/video for work, but voice can be distracting.
Props to the Cameraman for holding it for so long
Hey, will you release this beast of a soundtrack in any medium (e.g. Spotify)?
The whole of history got explained in 1 hour but the FNAF lore took 8 💀
history of the entire world, i guess?
I love Kurzgesagt. But gotta nitpick Kurzgesagt's thumbnail. The reason why the word "Pre-history" exists is because "history" begins with the written word. So there aren't 4.5 billion years of history. History began in about 3400 BC, only a few thousand years ago. Before that it was pre-history.
English is my second language. Honestly, I think I lack the proper vocabulary to properly explain how much I love this video and how important Kurzgesagt has become in my life since I discovered this channel.
I don’t even have words to describe how cool it was!!! Thank you for this awesome video!!
Utterly wonderful!!!
Finally, an education lofi worth watching and listening to :)
I watched everything and it’s incredible how you’re so generous to give this for free, the animation was amazing and I got so lost watching every layer and trying to figure it out in the best way possible. The way you create content is astonishing
That music 😍
timescale is WILD
this is the best thing ever holy shit the amount of work and time put into this one video
Could this video possibly be the longest animated sequence shot ever created? The Guiness Book needs to be consulted! 😎 (thank you for amazing work)
Wait are you saying it took millions of years just for one little meteor thing to hit earth?
Music is very addictive
From nothing to a thing, from single cell to multiple cell. It's impossible without programer
once one may create such a great image of editing and story telling and then shares this video content.. sorry to say this but i was expecting a much better video for this topic... this is just moving slide running for 15 mins... why wasting so much time of the viewers?
Dope beatsies
What an experience! Thank you so much.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
didn't expect this masterpiece lol
This is a work of art - much luv
2019 they started and put they're dedication into completing a few years worth project and hey presto thanks it was a great watch
There’s just something about that fleeting glance from humanity as the video ends
I absolutely love this video, thanks for creating it.
3:50 was like a Hadean  "My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio" moment. Also, incredible video!
Very nice! Two things I've noticed so far (though I know I'm bot the first):  - 29:43 has some of the visuals breaking apart at the bottom  39:56 sounds like someone spitting before resuming talking
i cry 😭😭😭😭😭
Shoutout to the cameraman for bringing us this 5 billion year Timelapse
My mind has troubles just comprehending how long this took to research, plan and time out, animate, just 🤯
yo the mesoarchean ost is dope asf 19:41
wow
World’s first game of “the floor is lava” and no one is around to play 😢
Loved it
This feels like fertile ground for a prog rock album overdubbing the sound track.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the music as is, but I can see these visuals and their meaning being interpreted in so many interesting ways sonically.
Incredible
The Best
smoke weed & watch
❤
I had to time travel 4.5 billion years to see this video.
Humans have existed on Earth for approximately 0.0066% of Earth's existence (Earth 4.54 billion years old/humans 300,000 years on Earth). Therefore if the average human lives to 80, that mean less than 2 days of your life represents human existence on Earth since Earth formed.
3:37
bill wurtz did 13.7 billion years in 20minutes, not impressed
Not sure if the copyrights would have permitted it but having the boss-level music from Super Mario for the initial lava phase would have been rad!
29:44 is that glitch there for everyone or is it just me
Amazing video
This Video was a wonderful experience and for me and probably a lot of other people an emotional roller coaster (by the end i was literally crying) As always Kurzgesagt absolutely delivers one of the best videos ever made....
I watched the end so I don't have to guess, it took 4 years, wow.
Million
Why kurzgesagt videos can be viewed in the background with the yt app and others not?
this, again, shows me how insignificant my lifespan on earth really is.
Forget the video, music alone is top tier!
Huge respect for the cameraman for surviving so long
Um actually~ the earth is around 8000-6000 years old ☝🏻🤓
Mesoarchaen Doom era
Reminds me of Fantasia how they explain the origin of life on earth
The Composer of this music is clearly a TOOL fan!
We thank all the birbs that helped make this video.❤
earth is believed to be 4.5 billions years old. its not a fact. just with the current evidence is it assumed too be. theories change all the time. exactly how we thought the age of the universe is
i blinked...
I will tell when I am done watching this masterpiece!
It's crazy how little humans have even existed throughout the Earth's history. We really are just tiny specs by comparison.
breathtaking and thrilling
Good stuff
Great way to keep me entertained during work. Seems to make my work day feel..... short.
History of humanity is too short compared to the age of earth, yet we have already developed the power to destroy the earth hundreds of times. What more can i say?
Wonderfully animated, this is beautiful☺
spoiler alert in this video!
After half hour mark the quality has dropped quite significantly lmao
The music gives me Terraria vibes
The floor is lava ha ha
my theory is that in the cryogenian era it was safe under the ice where underwater volcanos were at creating pockets of life to flourish greatly and spread
BEAUTIFUL.
Add 2 more hours, from the Big Bang and we would have the best "3 hours deep sleep, relaxing" video on internet, please 😜 ❤
Today's epsiode was brought to you by Jeff Wayne!
This is so beautiful, thank you
I'm just here for the jams
Glitch 29:43 🤭🤫
Arguably the Best Video on the Internet
Light work, Bill Wurtz did it in 20 minutes
Gerade zum Afterhour Schieben dieses Meisterwerk geschaut, super😅
I really love kurzgesagt. And this video is the best I’ve ever seen❤
Privately sponsored by the big bill foundation.
34:00 which structure?
I cried 🥹
What kind of genre is the music for the Mesoarchean?  Cause it's metal af.  It's not quite djent, it's not synth.  I want it in my rotation but need to know what to look for.  Specific artist suggestions would be great.
It is INSANE that this channel gives us this content for FREE. You guys are probably the most amazing team of content creators this platform has ever seen. Hut ab vor eurem Talent.
What an astonishing video! Thanks for the great toil in making this stupendous masterpiece.
some visual glitches after 10:30 -> several meteors suddenly disappear in the transition area (in temporal sense) not intended as a criticism, just a heads up if anyone cares
wow round of applause for the team for making this very educational video that started all the way from 2019. absolutely amazing video!
More “scientism” propaganda.  The billions and billions of years lie.  There is so much proof available to all of us now that shows that we live on a very young Earth.  The rocks are screaming at us that there is a Creator.  Our DNA shows His signature.  Even though they know there is a Creator, they don’t want you to know about Him.  The billionaires who pull the strings are literally worshipers of Satan himself.  They have sold their souls in order to remain in power so they help the deceiver to deceive the masses.  Wake up little sheep and do some research!!
It would be a great if you also made a version without any commentary.
You sick, incredible, and beautiful masterminds have been working on this since I've in college. I've just gained SO MUCH NEW RESPECT for you, Kurzgesagt team!! I've been your fan since like 2016, but this just bought my subscription for another 10 jajajajja Happy anniversary! :D
the music is 60bpm, or one beat per second. Amazing attention to detail!
This was an amazing concept for a video and super cool to watch. I think's a little bit of a missed opportunity that Kurzgesagt doesn't really get into modernity or talk about the history of humans and societies and art. The videos usually stick to space-stuff and physicis-stuff, i'd love to see more diversity in the fields of sience that the channel covers.
would love this as a audio track to fall asleep to
Hard to believe humans have only been around for about 300000 years. Not even a half a million. And in that time we only became interesting around 10000 years ago when we made major steps like Fire and Farming. The really interesting stuff happened in the late 1800s early 1900s when we became able to make motors and machines to harness energy released from burning stuff. Then we were able to make complex machines to manufacture other things and around the 1940s we were able to make calculation machines (computers) which allowed us to store and manipulate data. It is moving faster at ever increasing intervals that we will double our tech in less and less time where it will explode again. Hard to imagine what will come after the next explosion. Will the earth move move beyond carbon animals into a mechanical life form or will we get hit by another rock?
This is simply beautiful, the level of production quality: the soundtrack, the visuals, the narrator, the writing, it gave me goosebumps watching this.  Videos like these are so incredibly empowering, it shows that life is a story of undying struggle ever since step foot on the planet, i only hope this can inspire more people to look at the world differently and promote positive change so that we may stick around for a little longer to see how things are gonna turn out.  Thank you so much for this video! Keep up the amazing work!
It's a really cool video!
Religious fanatics after watching this video - "This is fiction, there is no truth in it. God made Earth and the Universe 6000 years ago, and dinosaurs are fake."
Love this channel, it taught me tons of stuff and I've been following it for years now and they still find a way to produce novel and accurate content.  I'd very much enjoy having an 10h version in the background for a website/blog/store or whatever, I feel like videos of this kind can make people understand how we fit in our home planet and that we are a tiny part of a hole grander universe  Don't you think it would be amazing to have an even  more detailed timelapse ? For example one second = 100 thousand years or hole earth history in a month and let that play continuously on website so that people realize the true scale of time. I would totally implement it.  3 comments in one,  From an old fan rediscovering the channel 👌🏻
Epic video guys!
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 3 Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
59:46 And the dinosaurs are gone...
I wish I could live longer.
The music in this is seriously giving major Subnautica vibes and I'm here for it.
Subhanallah!
This video is extremely beautiful, thank you guys
If this tells you anything it is not to worry about climate change. People saying “we need to save the planet” actually mean they want to extent time humans have on the planet as the planet will be fine whatever happens as it always has been.
Amazing!❤ But I have two questions: Why did the earth cool down and why did it start raining? Where did the H²O come from?
The music is giving subnatiqua, which is the biggest compliment I can give
T H I S  W A S  V E R Y  H A R D  T O  W A T C H  P L E A S E  D O N ‘ T  D O  T H I S  A G A I N
"dinosaurs are everywhere!" shows us 5.
One of the best channels on YouTube. Beautiful, smart, balanced. Long time fan.
Can I get the background music track ID??
58:12 HE SAID IT!
So is it possible that life may thrive as well for other planets like how Earth evolved into something amazing? It maybe can, but probably takes for more than billions of light years to do so. This hour of my life got me thinking that even life itself takes more than billions of years to appear and maybe it can to other planets as well. I never even thought that I'd be staring at it for an hour.
what a big project!
45:00 For me, this is the greatest achievement of life.
Most beautiful kurzgesagt video
Young earth took “the floor is lava” to a WHOLE NEW LEVEL
Thank you for this 1 hour episode. So cool!
Many thanks to the whole team, you have done an amazing job. Refreshingly original and fun to watch.
what a banger soundtrack
Awesome (in the true sense of the word) video!
First sentence "Earth is 4.5 billion years old" welp this whole video is a bunch of opinions
@SPCv4 an hour long animation takes  at most a few weeks to produce with a single skilled animator and modern animation software. Most of the time, animators just pick the beginning and end poses of a scene and a few intermediary steps then the computer interpolates between the positions to achieve the desired effect. This means it takes a few minutes to about an hour max to render a minute of animation. A really labor intensive portion of animation is lip flapping to speech track, but they don't have any of that in these videos, and there's also software that can do that automatically.
LOVE IT
I liked this a lot!
I don't know why but this gives me Celeste vibes and I love it.
Bill Wurtz did this in 20 minutes, not impressed /j
i didt know animals can live more than 1 million years
Anyone else getting Tool vibes in the Tonian, great tunes
awesome
+1 to the karma of the music author. ✍️
What a phenomenal work of art! Every single one of you knocked it outta the park! Excellent job, and looking forward to ten more years of amazing, informative, entertaining, and brilliant content from you.
Cheers to lengthy kurzg videos
the music at 20 minutes goes hard af
can you make a 4.5 billion year long video so i can watch everything unfold in real time?
The sun is a deadly laser
The constant motion to the right messes with the eyes. Afterwards, it feels like everything is moving in the other direction.
An ADHD trap
All the comments it's a about animation and not the actual history. I get it.. It's basically just a music video.. Also, that's how humans are . Am I the only who thought I could learn something coming to this video ??
I watched all of it while trying to finish my project and i am still not even close to finish it 💔
Someone said it's 1 hour of animation when 40% of it was a thing called loop. Bet he never heard that..
Nice Animation. But this is far from truth. these are just theories
I love you kurzgesagt
My god
good job !
2023
thanks kurzgesagt
QUE PIJE MUSICOOOON
Top G
Personally I think this would've been better without any music this time around, and there were a couple of meteorites disappearing during the transition to the Eoarchean period, but otherwise good video
the absolute legends, they never miss!
Yes because the earth told u all this
Fantastic! I've been with you for all ten years, I own the book, buy your calendar every year and have just bought the Quest 3 game. Please keep doing what you're doing because it is really appreciated by millions of us. You manage to educate while entertaining and that is a skill very few have. Here's to the next ten years!
17434th comment
Excellent content....i would like to request to the creators of this channel, please make another dedicated channel in Bengali language. 🙏🙏🙏
I could watch this 10 more hours xD so chillin, informative and simple good 😃
Music was amazing too.
Amazing 💖
Fantastic. Thank you.
The sun is a deadly laser.
But what a wonderful video! I think every person on this planet should see this video, and reflect on how insignificant we are on the time scale of our planet! And learn how important the Earth is to all of us. We must take care of our planet so that we are not just something that happened on the time scale!
Suddenly our B.S. doesn’t seem so important.
Much hot and comfy?
Music in this is banging
I love how the moon slowly recedes from the Earth. Amazing attention to detail.
I really enjoyed this!! Could you make that same style video for all of “Life’s History” and/or “Human History”?
This definitely puts into perspective the theory of life possibly originating outside of our planet. The amount of time it took for prokaryotic life to evolve was relatively short and in a rather harsh early earth environment. The amount of time just between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells is astonishing
I fell asleep to this video and honestly, it’s a great video to fall asleep to
OH. MY. GOD.
Truly amazing
Amazing work man
People still do not believe in God🤣🤣 that all happened by coincidence🤣
1:00:11 - historicaly accurate hahah
Thank you so much for this. 👏
Music in half of  hadean is lit fire🥵
3 minutes and 31 seconds: *you dare ignore me?*
Not many creators can pull this off. To make 3 million people watch one hour of mostly silent video in 3 days. Amazing job. I’m already watching it a second time! And yes, the music is otherworldly 👍🏼
The first movie ever where the protagonist gets only 2 seconds of screen time
That was juicy and out of this world (super insightful)
can you please do a video about dengue?
It takes 1 month to make 30 seconds of animation on average for 1 artist working around the clock.  For 1 hour, that 5400 seconds, that's 90 months of work for one person. That's 6.5 months of work for each animator for this video. This doesn't account for everything else.  Plus what's crazy is its all free in this video.   Thank you Kurzgesagt for making such a lovely video.
IRL, this would have been the longest continual panning shot in history and prehistory combined.
That was so amazing!! We need the same for humanity!!
Literally, I Completing the assignment(for which I got 12 days) in one hour!
This is truly amazing. Thanks for continuing to make the Internet and the world a better place!
This is just exquisite. Thank you!
noooo what happened to this channel? it used to be dope
Awesome video, as always!  Question: during the Hadean period , Earth was bombarded with asteroids. During the Eoarchean period , it rained  for millions of years. What is the origin of this water?
You're the best 👏👏👏
B-b-but where's my primordial SOUP!?   Jokes aside, really cool animation and education, thanks for sharing it with us
If the Earth comes snowball period, and the Sun happened to get old, expanded, hotter. Will the snowball resist the sun light heating?
Also a huge FUCK YOU to YouTube for their policy on addblockers. Really did NOT appreciate this being interrupted.
Absolutely mesmerizing!
The floor is lava!! 😂
I don't know if you noticed but the history of the earth seems a lot like the hero's journey or another saga involving a person, look: Hadean- Troubled childhood with a toxic family Eoarcheon- Traumatic pre-adolescence for some reason Paleoarcheon- Rebellious phase and the character runs away from his home Mesoarchean- The main character is very innocent and is manipulated and deceived. Neoarchean- The character managed to reestablish himself and do new things. Siderean- The character managed to recover even more and begins to survive in a pleasant way Rhyacian- The character loses past mistakes and creates a protective layer due to his traumas.

Set the speed on 1.5x and you got yourself a little kurzgesagt rave
Hollywood will charge this video $17 each person. We get it for free is INSANE. Love your channel so much
Bro woke up and published a banger on YouTube
I wonder what the next 4.5 billion years will look like.
Am I the only one that think they could have done better with the animation. The voice over didn’t match the repetitive rolling landscape…
Damn Youtube Ads took 20 million years !
The genre of music: Techno Trance ❤
Babe wake up, kurtzgesagt posted a one hour video
Of all the times in history to be alive, i have somehow managed to be here for information like this.
I think Well Call This The Earth Movie
Thanks
1 hour of pure speculations and assumptions! Great job !
lots'o dead rocks for the first half of earth existence huh  and then dead rocks made a masterpiece  how incredible
I've been struggling to find a sense to anything that's happening in my life. Looking at the entirety of this video feels sobering, because ok, it has no sense, but it's fascinating that it took so much time for life to finally explode, and it's taking magnitude less for us to... go forward? Not knowing where, but forward. It made me feel like I'm part of something. Thank you.
Loved it.
mesoarchean's song decided to go so hard for no reason, i love it
Watching it without skipping and seeing the whole history of humankind in the last second hit me quite hard.
that soundtrack is killer
the transition from jurassic to cretaceous👌
Who's here from Logically Explained?
뭐라고?
this is such a piece of art!
I'm using this video as background noice to write my masters thesis and it's doing wonders for my concentration! So calming!
Don't take me wrong but I have watch videos twice the 1 hour 3 minutes
Time really is relative.
You are the best❤. Love it
love it
❤
This is a prog song. You can't change my mind.
Our species really came onto the scene.
C est absolument  génial comme video! Merci de nous ouvrir les yeux sur la dimension du temps.😊
Good luck, subtitle guy
Andromeda galaxy disagrees with you... ROFL get our of my face. Little. Horm.. ROFL🤣🤣
Brb guys need to get some water *comes back* Hey whered the dinosaurs go
incredibly beautiful.
This is some dedication that my lazy ass can't comprehend.  Good work kurzgesagt ❤
You guys deserve more viewers
I’m already addicted to this channel and to see an hour long video uploaded… I made myself a full meal to watch this!
I'm blown away by the quality animation and beautiful music!
The voiceover explaining it all like he was there to witness it
Booking marking this for the next acid trip
4.5 billion years condensed into One hour and sophisticated life doesn't appear until about 55 minutes. Really put into perspective how old the earth is
“The algae Bambiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex” Wow that was out of left field DAMN
❤❤❤❤
terraria music vibes  honestly tho this doubles as  playlist, keep it up kurzgesagt
Crazy how 4.5billion years can be explained in enough detail to understand in just 1 hour
I admire your bravery to upload a 1-hour video in an era where people don´t have the patience nor the attention span to watch a 1-minute video.
This vdo should be compulsory in every school ….. 👏👏
Very strong imagination you have.
Brilliant video concept! It would be interesting to see the temperature and pressure ranges as well as atmospheric composition for the different periods throughout the video.  Thank you for yet another great video!
Congrats Kurzgesagt, for being one of the best in merging art and science for 10 years straight now, and always larded with the accurate mix of earnestness and humor. A Nobeloscar would be in place!
long story short: it is not worth to get angry for just 90y of life
1:36 put a smile on my face :)
You are amazing...would be using this for future reference. Thank you!
I’ve been asleep for the last 1.3 billions years, last I remember we were leaving the Hadian, could some one can’t me up?
Kinda disappointed with the Orosirian. I would have liked to see that big asteroid impact the narrator talks about :D
HAPPY TEN YEARS KURZGESAGT THANK YOU FOR PUTTING OUT QUALITY CONTENT
Mesoarchean period music goes so hard
a MUST see
World is 6000 years old! Jesus told me!
Me playing this music in the club ✊️😌
I follow for the good quality content and to see what the atheists are up to.
had some tears in my eyes, beautiful
Not only is this a visual marvel imo, the music accompanying the change of time and landscape is absolutely lit! I find myself just munching on tibits and bobbing my head to the tune as i watch ancient earth evolve and change from barrens lands to watery worlds to icy deserts and back again! This is such an amazing video on the topic! I had ton of fun with this! Thanks Kurzgesagt !!
19:41 when the doom music kicks in...
Amazing job guys absolutely love this
That was Therapeutic. I was waiting to see the first human since the start of the video. Getting to see a human only in the last second, tells us how NEW we are. How SHORT our time has been on the Earth.   Also we don’t know how long are we gonna last as species.  We think we’re at the pinnacle of evolution but the history is evident, that’s unfortunately not the case.  So while we’re here, let’s be at peace, harmony and love everyone. Let’s be more compassionate and empathetic to others. And don’t forget to experience this beautiful life. Gratitude. Peace. Harmony!  One Earth. One Family. One Future. 🌍🕉️  Hari Om Tat Sat🙏
Simply Amazing
A 1-hour long video where pretty much nothing happens for most of it... that's quite a bold proposition.  And quite a good way to put in perspective our existence and show how young we really are.
Who ever made this video probably made the the marvel movies… I can’t lie I just spent the last 2 days watching this on my lunch break not disappointed what so ever.
How the hell is this free
Need this as a wallpaper
This would be so Nice, if only a real person read this not a computer AI.
one hour kurzeegegezagt video? woww!
One of the best videos on youtube congrats to everyone that worked on it
Ngl Every frame is Wallpaper Material...
Love it ❤
You lost me at 4.5 Billion Years Old 😅😅😅
Damn, this is amazing.
This is a most craziest clip I’ve ever seen before!
45:00 The moment we've all been waiting for, fellow nerds. The invention of sex on planet Earth. You're welcome.
What is the genre name of this type of music?
Stop cappin. Jesus made this whole thing 6,000 years ago with his daddy. The fossils were planted by Satan to deceive us and make us question god. Idk where you pulled this crap from in the video cause that’s what happened. Go ask any Christian on the planet and they’ll tell yuh!
Fictionfixer Gyatta make a edit with this one🗣️🗣️🗣️
I get emotional when I watch it! It's a wonderful work and I shared to all my friends! Thank you!
I probably skipped past most of what you said. Can you please remake this with just the talking parts edited together?
How the hell am i able to minimize this as a small screen while i cajt do this with any other yt video?
I’m 71 and I loved it! I  am a child again!!
how can it rain when there's no water to form a cloud?
Wow wow wow!!! Massive respect to the whole team especially to the artists , illustrators, animators and the people whole collected the data.
This is like the greatest movie I have ever watched.
SUPER ! Dommage qu'il manque des explications de la provenance de chaque infos du genre "D'ou provient les premières pluies ? "
Notre véritable importance est tellement éloignée de celle que nous fantasmons. Cette vidéo est un outil fantastique pour le réaliser. On devrait montrer votre travail dans les écoles du monde entier. Merci.
thank u so much for this amazing video !!!!
Props to the camera person to time traveler to get this!
Loved it , the only very slight issue I have is should have had more commentary
omg please make more of these videos, I used this while studying and it's sooo relaxing
Uberly visual satisfying especially with the music, i can throw a party while playing this video thanks!
Me and the boys watching the Hadean period
Subtitles from 30sec mark to 50min  00:00:33 4.5 billion years ago, right after it was born, Earth was a hell of lava…  00:00:41 Pretty early in its history, Earth collides with a Mars sized object called Theia, which forms the moon that you now see in the sky. Right now it looks huge in the night sky and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions of years as it orbits further away.  00:01:06 4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld.  00:01:32 At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2 and the floor is lava. This area of earth's history is mostly invisible to us because almost none of it is left.  00:02:06 90 million years have passed.  We are still in the lava hell phase. Settle in, this will take a while.  00:02:47 Although you wouldn't think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate there may have been some water around at this time.  00:06:48 During this period of the young solar system, Earth and the inner solar system are smashed by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment, for several hundred million years.  00:07:12 At this point in time, our Sun is 30% less bright than it is today but there are so many greenhouse gases that it's still much hot and comfy.  00:08:16 Around this time we think life begins to enter the stage. Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet. Earth continues to cool and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form, covering the still young planet with water.  00:12:43 These hydrothermal vents we're looking at, and where hot minerals emerge, may have been the place where life first developed, but we dont know.  00:13:18 So much time has passed and we are entering the Paleoarchean. Most of Earth is still underwater while the first supercontinents are in the making in the depths below. Its days are shorter since the young Earth spins faster. Good job if you are still watching. You witnessed a billion years so far.  00:17:49 From this time in history we still have Stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by microorganisms. Among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also life is starting to eat the sun – photosynthesis might have started as early as around here.  00:18:35 3.2 Billion Years Ago in the Mesoarchean the era of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin to crush into each other, pulling and pushing some deep into the earth where they dissolve. The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hottub, over 40°C and microbes are expanding everywhere. We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases, so it is really, really hot. You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also there is no oxygen in the atmosphere yet.  00:23:51 2.8 Billion Years Ago the Neoarchean begins. Earth is still a terribly hostile place but because we finally have proper plate tectonics, more chemicals are mixed in from inside the earth and life can use them to make new things!  00:24:34 Some time around here Prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet. Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, we only have single cells.  00:27:46 2.5 Billion Years Ago in the Siderian, a massive event is about to begin that will change the planet forever: The Great Oxidation Event. Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria reaches the atmosphere in large quantities, paving the way for more complex life.  00:29:39 All the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and Water, which rapidly cools the planet down.  00:30:16 Probably for the first time ever, the planet freezes over and a period of multiple ice ages begins lasting millions of years. 2.3 Billion Years Ago the Rhyacian begins.  00:31:14 Lots of volcanos heat up earth and earth unfreezes slowly again. Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the oceans but life quietly puts up resistance and keeps evolving.  00:33:49 Some time 2.05 Billion Years Ago in the Orosirian a large asteroid hits earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on Earth.  00:34:47 All over Earth great mountain ranges are crushed into existence by early continents with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlantica.  00:37:00 1.8 Billion Years Ago in the Statherian the supercontinent Columbia has formed. And a natural, self sustaining nuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium deposits in the ground.  00:39:37 1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of Calimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so, the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells. One of the most important moments in the history of life. But yes, kind of looks not that impressive. Still, life is only cells.  00:41:35 Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents form, the oceans become shallower. Also the first fungi-like organisms extent their tubular arms and do fungi things. Some time in the Ectasian 1.4 Billion Years Ago, Earths inner core is forming. Weird, right? Feels like it should be older. But around here it begins to solidify into a iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal. It will only grow from now on.  00:44:53 1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian not that much is going on. Except, the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex. A big reproductive improvement for many different reasons.  00:47:33 1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans. Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right?  00:50:07 Not everybody is having a great time here...
Take.  A. Fuckin.  BOW.
does this mean we all die young since we only live for up to 80-100 some places worse than others and earth is not that old we are all so young and die that way
Give a sticker for all the cameramen, they had to go through cringe skibidi toilet, and now this!
W video very nice channel been a fan for 5 years good job
My question is…. All the trillions and trillions of life forms that have existed over these billions of years. Bacteria and dinosaurs and who knows what else… and humans are so arrogant and think ghost exist but seem to only see dead humans from the 1920s…. If ghost were real wouldn’t we be seeing them from all this stuff over time that has died.
Imagine if there was an alien species watching us since are planet was created
It is crazy how much knowledge humanity has acquired in the last 300 years. We have thousands of subjects we are expanding on today which I will list just some below. Sciences: Biology (Microbiology, molecular biology, marine biology, botany, biotechnology, genetics, physiology, medicine, zoology, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, Immunology, [all of the different insects and reptile biology], pharmacology, endocrinology, Neurology, etc.) Chemistry (Organic Chemistry, Nuclear Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry, Photochemistry, Geochemistry, Chemical Oceanography, Thermochemistry, Electrochemistry, etc.) Physics (Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, electromagnetism, Optics, Relativity, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics, Fluid Dynamics, Acoustics, Cosmology, Quantum Computing, Rocket Science, Astronomy, etc.) Environmental Studies (Ecology, Geology, Oceanography, Environmental Engineering, Farming, Hydrology, Climate Science, Waste Management, etc.) Psychology (Early Childhood Development, Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience, Cross-Cultural Analysis, Psychometrics, Clinical Psychology)  Social Sciences: Philosophy (Metaphysics, Ethics, Morals, Politics, Aesthetics, Epistemology, Religion, etc.) Sociology and Anthropology (Statistics, Demography, Gender Studies, Cultural Studies, Conflict Resolution Study, etc.) Art (Visual Arts, Musical Study, Sculpture Art, Performance Arts, Theatres, Photography, Architecture, Printing, Dance, Digital Art, etc.) History (Ancient History, Modern History, Political Analysis, Archeology, Women's History, [each region's history], etc.) Economics (Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Econometrics, Information Economics, Industrial Economics, Mathematical Economics, Game Theory, Insurance Agent, etc.) Law (Criminal Law [Criminology], Civil Law, Administrative Law, Corporate Law, Property Law, International Law, Cyber Law, etc.)  Language and Communication: Linguistics (Phonology, Morphology, Discourse Analysis, Grammar, Syntax, Semantics, Translation Studies, Sign Language, Body Language, Phonetics, Pragmatics, Psycholinguistics, Historical Linguistics, Lexicology, Semiotics, etc.) Literature (Literary Analysis, Rhetoric, Poetry, Prose, Journalism, Nonfiction Analysis, Short Stories, Novels, Genre Study, Satire) Writing (Descriptive Writing, Persuasive Writing, Expository Writing, Copywriting, Lyrical Composition, etc.) Communications (Mass Media, Advertising, Interpersonal Communications, Marketing, Social Media, Publishing, Broadcasting, Cultural Communications, etc.)  Mathematics Algebra (Linear Algebra, Elementary Algebra, Logarithmic Study, Abstract Algebra, etc.) Geometry (Euclidean Geometry, Trigonometry, Analytic Geometry, Topography, Differential Geometry, Numerical Analysis, etc,) Calculus (Differential Calculus, Integral Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Non-Standard Calculus Analysis, etc.) Logic  Informatics and Computing Technology (Radiology, Information Technology (IT), Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Software development, Programming, Telecommunications, etc.) Informatics (cryptology, Data Science, Analytics, HCI, etc.) Computer Studies (Edge/Cloud Computing, Algorithms, Graphics, BCI, Combinatorics, etc.) Business (Accounting, Finance, Management, Human Resources, Supply Chain Analysis, MISs, e-commerce Study, etc.)  Let me know what I missed, what you think I miscategorized, etc. Still truly amazing how much Information we've accumulated in 300 years, and how crazy things will be in 300 years.
Crazy props to the camera man for filming for billions of years just for a 1hour video 🎉
this is insanely good.
If I tell people I spent 4.5 billion years watching a youtube video no one is going to believe me
The content is so good that it is impossible to miss a single video of yours 😘🥰
Yo that ending song was a bop.
Truely amazing video 🔥🌏 It's insane how in a one hour video all human history is shown in a few seconds and in these few seconds THIS much has happened 🌐
"Back in the days, the floor was lava." -👴🏻
Superb music, feels like in a theatre listening to this. 😮
Kurzgesagt lofi be like
Suspiciously quickly.
I love the music!
the animation is perfect level, tho you could have provided so much more infos and details to match the visuals. the video is an hour long yet the narrator only said a bunch of sentences every now and then.
12:25 magic pothole removal
It's very amazing to actually see that all of the human history only occupied the last one second in the whole one hour video.❤🎉 1:00:39
Hmmm, no wonder I got conked on the head by a couple million asteroids during the first 800 million years or so... And yes, it took me 3.5 billion years to write this.
im 4.5 billion years old now ig
0,00001 Million years ago Kurzgesagt came to existence.
Make a version without narrator please 🙏
How This Mind blowing Piece of Animation and Beautiful Music and sound design of ONE HOUR is sitting here free on youtube is beyond me. Mad Props to the entire team of Kurzgesagt for this.👏👏👏
Mesmerizing and beautiful; the music was incredible, especially at the end.
LEARN THE TRUTH, JESUS SAVES, GOD LOVES YOU
I had no idea how much I needed this😭
Nice argumentto all those "before it was better" pals😊
Fantastic video - innovative. It's like a combination of electronic music festival, side scrolling videogame, and history lesson.
The animation is great, but there was a lot of information omitted and a of of silent spaces, I'd say the animation was wasted on an underprepared narrator.
Damn he animated this all himself? Just wow!
Can someone explain how it first started raining during the Eoarchean period? Where did this rain come from? Where did the hydration come from?
watch this while u baked
That was wild!
Truly amazing
Insane work, everything is perfect!
❤❤❤
1:03:19  SAVE BIRDS 🐦  😊
Props to the cameraman
The rendition at the end, with the human kid looking at the camera then everything finishing, really depicts well how brief our own history has been on earth, even if we're having a huge impact so far. Thank you so much for this great video!
What? You're working in this from 2019? And still misses out on most of details, like how cells evolve and their internal structure and changing map of earth's continents, and remained silent most of that time and, displayed repeated animation for most of the time, really kurzgesagt isn't the same any more. 😢
Bill wurtz: wow my history of the entire is pretty good Kurzgesagt: Amateur
Bill wurtz did it better
Mad respect for you guys who provide such quality content for free to millions of people. Literally, hats off. You are one of the most fascinating science channel in the platform
Thinking about it - silicon chip life will come *instantly* after the human we saw on screen at the end of this video.   Human intelligence is really just a catalyst for the age of machines.
Is cameraman pre-modern human? Because his patience and ability to not accelerate is legendary
Cameramen are crazy
Proper use of my break time
Live while you can, Joy while you can, Suffer while you can, Love while you can.
*props to cameraman who was there to record it all*
I want the soundtrack to this.  Absolutely phenomenal video! Thank you for doing this.
Props to you guys. I never comment, like ever. But I felt like I needed to because you did such a good job as a team!!
This is awesome and all, but what would be really cool is if you had a level where we could control a character, like Ninja Gaiden. Or Soap.
Props to the narrator who lived so long and the billions of years old great tunes to haha
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Amazing...
Modern humans have been around for over 400,000 years we’ve been lied to
Pls also make one more like this but 10 hours !!!!!!
Very very very impressive. great work❤❤
@kurzgesagt One little mistake I found, during Paleoarchean and Mesoarchean. First cyano bacteria did photosynthesis but not with chlorophyll which is green, but with retinol. so the earth might be violet/red in the beginning before the successor chlorophyll replaces retinol. nevertheless great video!
Watching at 2x ☝🏿
Kurzgesagt just made an hour long lofi beats with also teaching science and history. Amazing 👏
All of your videos give me some kind of existential crisis. But this.. this takes the cake. You really captured the magnitude and scale of time, and the insignificance of human history with the music and animation. "Don't blink or you might miss all of human history " still gives me goosebumps.   Thank you Kurzgesagt.
Why did you make the first photosynthesis green instead of purple. Did you forget the purple earth
Of you don't watch it whole, you will miss the point, amazing work!
"Life, uh, finds a way." 😂 Love it. Amazing content as always. Never let down with your uploads.
What a great illustration about earth, our time is just tiny seconds of earth lifetime.
Bill Wurtz wants to know your location
Would be nice and interesting if you could do a human evolution and a human history video like this. Mad respect for this fire video anyways 🔥🔥
Who knew the mesoarchean period was so metal. 🤘🏻🤘🏻
My god bill wurtz have been bested
It never really registered with me that it took 3 billion years to get from simple life to complex life
I Can Watch This All Day🖤
Amazing 🧡
Crazy to think that in this condensed form of earth’s life in 1 hour, we are less than a second old.
22:49 is that a twister?
Please make a video no need to make  this very long but 10-20 minutes may be... About 12023 years like ... please
Man I really thought you were gonna be explaining stuff and I'd fall asleep to that for so long, but I ain't using a beat to fall asleep
I cant believe I’m watching this video for free
No way am I going to listen to an hour of that music.
1 hour of kurzgesagt? YESSORRRRR
I appreciate the effort that went into this, but I'd like to request a condensed version with constant narration if you guys ever get the chance!
아기 인류.. 생명의 대선배들에게 고개를 숙이고 그들을 생각해야한다. 그 생명의 대가 이어지지 않았다면 인류는 탄생조차 할 수 없었을 것…
Came for the video. Stayed for the music. lol
Well this really puts things in perspective doesn't it
whoover came up with the idea of this video is definitely a stoner
Add doom ost to this
Cap
I can only imagine how insane these videos would be if they had a budget similar or equal to some of the biggest shows/documentaries. 🫠👍
This was literally a time travel video.
wow what a great video. every second was impressive😁
What a load of crap lol!
This video is a vibe ❤
This gives very strong Tetris Worlds vibes. Cool background music, and a barren planet slowly filling with life over time in the background.
this is legit history of the entire world i guess if bill wurtz had advanced degrees in all aspect of earths history
This is awesome. If you haven’t already, you should totally publish a version without the voiceover for studying background audio visuals
💪💪
Goosebumps 🥺🥺🥺
this sound design makes brain go brrr
Increíble ❤
Man the fact you were doing this since 2019 is just mindbogling! Keep up the good work
Bill Wurtz watching this: 👁👄👁
You don’t realise how exponential the development of life is until it’s been 50 minutes and life is still invisible to the naked eye
This is absolutely awesome!
I’ve always loved this channel and I genuinely can’t believe how good this is….the best info channel on YouTube stays undefeated
The Genesis of all things amazing!  Team Kurzgesagt, forgtive me, but I must.  This is my favorite video so far this year, and a top contender for all times.  This is brilliantly made!  It is 1 hour and representative of a dream of doing something like this in real life in a concert one day using Space Art technology, a dream evoked about 15 years ago and you guys did it in the best 2D fashion yet!  You see, this channel is my favorite channel currently subscribed to with my other accounts, so when I saw this video, I mean you guys really pushed it to a new level.  I have been since the age of 8, a fan of the french-belgian cartoon of "Il etait une fois l'homme" and this video reminds me of this.  It is a beautiful tapestry of the result of combining a modern Il etait une fois l'homme animation with a music dj set of 1 hour, presenting life and the history of.  I as a music producer from Canada, have really appreciate the detail of the score for this animation very much.  It feels like a long progressive EDM set by the Kurzgesagt DJ himself, hopefully Duck!  The music flows beautifully well with the visuals.  The details are amazing and worthy of reviewing many many times. This informative stellar artistry is captivating to say the least.  This is a grand production.  I love all of your videos very much and as the proud owner of some of your paraphernalia, I dig your product very much, but this episode is simply something at a new level.  This can absolutely stand by itself as a feature visual presentation in any planetarium on earth.  Even the Las Vegas Sphere should play this one time!  The only downfall, through no fault of your own, is the commercial adds breaks.  The swift scenery changes with the music adjustments is such a delight to experience I cannot get enough of it.  Now team Kurzgesagt, I believe this video will be quite  hard to top fellas, but I wish you the best of luck for the future.  Thank you from the bottom of my soul for producing such a gem.  Hats off to the animators and the music producers behind the score.
kinda crazy that we make up less than a second
This is the most German video I've ever watched
the music did not have to go that hard and it feels like it was made to be heard at 1.5 or 2x speed cause i am not sitting through all the millions of years in between all the major events
I love this channel! But I always wanted them to do something for stoners!! Thank u for the trip!! I could say a lot more, but, in a nutshell, this is a stoner pleaser. Thank u so much!!!
Anyone else blown away by the music?
Wonder why the asteroids stopped falling on earth once it started raining..
Ok but the moon is a hollow spaceship engineered by lizard people so…. 🙄
This is perfect for yoga
Yo, can you make wallpapers of them I really like mid Hadean and I want a wallpaper of it without the timeline bar in the way
1.5 billion years have passed and still I haven't started on my homework yet
We got history lore before GTA 6
Damn, it was raining and  just got the longest video on Youtube, it lasted for 22,500,000 years, by the end of it Earth was almost submerged and we entered Paleoarchean !  Thanks a lot Kurgezagt for all your work and for sharing all if it for free !
The music fire, a true masterpiece, amazing
Let's thank *Algae Bangiomorpha Pubescens* for inventing the best thing in this world
Tremendous work, the result is amazing, beautiful video!
Absolutely stunning piece of art and history, watched every second
Is there anyway to listen/purchase the audio only?
MI MAMÁ ME DIO LA VIDA, PERO KURZGESAGT LAS GANAS DE VIVIRLA
The Mesoarchean music has no business going this hard.
Man the fact that ALL of human history is not even 1 second of this video is utterly astonishing and puts life into perspective so well.
One of the best youtube videos of all time
Wait for it...
I'm now going to share this video to all the religious people that i know. 😂
Impressive, but Bill Wurtz accomplished that feat in no more than 20 minutes.  I joke, of course, good job.
The amount of luck a certain things that had to happen to use for our existence is bringing me existential dread
history of the entire world, i guess
The Siderian era's groove slaps. Starts around 27:00 in the Neoarchean. Sounds like I'm 9yrs old and playing Vectorman at some kid named Jared's house.
If you're looking for Biden he's halfway into the video
this video could have been so much shorter if you didnt pander. this is disgrace.
How did he fit so much time into an hour? That’s not how it works
You made a DJ mix for the last 4.5 billion years :D it's lovely!!
Really really awesome!!!
I saw an animation that the moon could have formed much faster. Unbelievably faster. ( I enjoyed this video, thank you. )
Great visualizations for people who can't grasp the vast expanse of time.
I'll be right back... just need a few supplements for when I watch :)
God dammit y’all really about to make me watch an hour video…
Some reason youtube allows me on ios to watch this video in mini-player on home screen no premium is it because it’s one hour long?
OMG what a treat!
Wow! 4,5 billions of years flew by in (felt like) an hour!!!
Awesome video!
"It's the CAMBRIAN EXPLOSIONNN Wow that's animals n stuff"
I didn't really expect super thurough animation along with the earth entire history but ngl Im a little disapointed with how basic the video itself was. I only learned through the very little that was said in the video, and it feels like half the things that were said weren't happening on screen. It's just a lot of pretty moving pictures
Wouldn’t be a kurzgesagt video with out a few comments reading “ we got this for free wow” keep it up
I would love a bibliography of the research papers that have gone into this video, as that is the only way I could believe this. How the fuck are people arguing about the pyramids, while other seeems to know the age if our planet and what it was loike during FOUR AND A HALF BILLION YEARS FFS
There hero we need but don't deserve
The music has no right to be this good. Absolute banger.
I love your videos! This was an awesome change in the usual video layout, super chill and informative.
That's actually incredible. Cool idea and great work!
That was incredible
I love this but also I feel like i was in  my childhood playing through a late 90s early 2000s game well done side scroller without a video game character to play with.  16 out of 10 rating.
300,000 years of existence and we still cant get along
7:12 "It's still much hot and comfy." **Dies from hypoxia and falls into the lava**
NO BUSINESS HAVING SUCH A SLAPPIN SOUNDTRACK. NO BUSINESS. NONE.
Honestly, I would have found it funny if the 'human history' at the end ended with a sudden instant metropolis for the present day, because all of our major technoligical achievements (farming, concrete, nuclear power, nuclear bombs) have happened in less than 25 thousand years (less than 1 frame at 1.5m years per second). We're literally nothing at the geological scale!
Mad respect to the camera man
Assuming we don't go extinct or kill ourselves, I can't imagine where we would be once humanity lived for just 10 seconds in his timeline. Just look at what humans have accomplished and discovered in half a second. If an average human from 10 million years in the future visits 2023, we would think it's God - or will the individual even still be considered human?
This is definitely an excuse to drop the hardest Kurzgesagt mixtape
that mesoarchean riff went hard
This one is going into my regular rotation with Carl Sagan and Exurb1a.  I love the music too!  Hats off, guys.
Cool
If there were a YouTube timeline video, then this video right here would represent the peak of YouTube evolution. A masterpiece.
The music reminds a bit of ROR2 ( Risk Of Rain 2 ) OST don't exactly know why but the music is awesome.
a true masterpiece... you guys are fucking legends!
what do you think about vsauce?
even no Oxigen, I can live in Mesoarchean Era with that soundtrack <3
Jesus freaks will say it took 6,000 years 😂
Take me back to the siderian period 😩
This soundtrack is INSANE 🥰🧑‍🎤
Ma at 3 am after watching a horror movie:
Oh ya this will be good ;)
Amazing stuff! Loved it. Missed a few things. Is a shorten narrated version happening. Like just all the stuff he says put together.
This is easily this channels best, most artistic video
Shoutout to the camera guy
Wrong. This is based off unproven theories and is just a pretty lie. When someone thinks they know the answer they will never ask the question again.
I didn't think I was in for a Tool concert...!
Science & House music LFG
Masterpiece!
finaly! the kurzgesagt movie
Imagine that you're a biologist. You've been selected to go back into time and observe the divergence from single cell to multi. Billions have been spent. It's been a multi-decade challenge to create the machine taking you into the past. Thousands have died mining resources, manufacturing materials, clearing land and constructing the megalithic pinnacle of human ingenuity. The entire world will be watching as you step into the device. It's time to leave. 3 2 1 Your here. There's virtually nothing to see from the window. Time to go outside. You gear up, open the hatch, take your first step, and find that not only has the device worked as planned, it has hit the targeted time and location so accurately that you crush the first and only multicellular life on the planet with your foot.
4 BILLION years (10^9) just to get multi cellular life, and we're destroying such a huge swatch of it in less than 400 (10^2)
amazing
the music is fire!
No lie I ate my dinner to half of this video. You gotta share the tracklist.
Wait.. we think life started, like, the SECOND it was possible? Like, floors not lava anymore and BAM?
And this is why I love you guys.
Carl Sagan would be so proud
this was mesmerizing. thank you
@45:00 noice
All that time  - and I get to be on stage for 2 seconds? If I'd known that, I never would have auditioned.
im so so impressed, how is this free? thank you for this truly
these people are sponsored by big corporations that spark conflict of interests
I could imagine a sequel to this as 10,000 human years in an hour or so
You guys should make this like a scrollable map like the scale of the universe
Can't believe thr mental gymnastics people will do to convince themselves the earth is round 😂
This is one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen. Kudos to the entire team
"life, uh, finds a way" THIS IS SO ICONIC
Rotflmbo
This is so amazing. Gives a whole new perspective of our time on this planet. And I also just wanted to commend the animators and sound designers who put the time and effort to put this video together. You guys are amazing
There's a guy who did it in 16 minutes
59:44 he says "wait, what's that?" 2 million years before the asteroid actually hit
Nice soundtrack. I like how long the aeons are. Millions of years just lava.
I think it would be cool to see the same format of video, starting from the cambrian explosion until today
normally whenever i see timelapses of the future or the past, i feel a shred of existential dread. not here. I'm just in awe of the animation, sound design, and soundtrack. nothing happens for 4 billion years, and the music is an absolute bop. this is great. Please make more stuff like this.
humans be like "west coast best coast!" "nah east coast is better!"  bruh we all from pangea
You know its good when its kurzgesagt
just an amazing hour!
This channel not only helped me with improving my english but also learning a LOT about science. THIS IS JUST AMAZING.
I skipped 10 seconds more than once that means I also skipped 10 million years of our history more than once.
insane work . Loved every bit of it
This is so beautiful great work guys!  I played a chill hour of KSP2 to this.
Can someone make this into a TV screensaver somehow?
Crazy that Im more than halfway through and life still has yet to get past the cellular stage. History is longer than I thought
continue to believe in your 4.5 billion years
Best video ever, I used it for background in my studies. I know you said it took ages to make, but i would love to see another one of these, maybe one with the human history? Anyway thank you, keep up the good work <3
Did you notice that at about 29:43, it glitches?
Thinks about that,who made it..... The One and only Allah almighty
Im a bit over halfway and totally mesmerized. Statherian probs my fave era with the visuals/music. This video rules
One hour later and now for the first time ever in my life i can say i believe in God.
I love the video, thank you for making this channel a reality.
Can't believe how many times the earth kills its own life
Can this kind of work (1 entire hour of animation) be done by AI in the future?
One of the best yt video
This entire video could be a screensaver or wallpaper
Good for concentration
I just LOVE the soundtrack for the Mesoarchean, anyone know the name of the song?
I feel like you could've explained where the water came from instead of just Asteroids fell and then it rained a lot
this music is great
Amazing! Will probably have this running in the background a few more times in the future :)
Can I hit the like button 4.5 billion times?
A beautiful masterpiece. Put simply.
Ocean has a Terraria type beat
I asked for some mini history, but this is wonderful. When did production time begin?
Bill Wurtz covered 3 times as long a timespan in only a third of this video's length.
masyaAllah
I vote this the Number 1 study/work background music!!!!!!! with animation!!! once in a while the narrator will come out of the bush to make sure you don't feel alone. So good!
Where all this rain in Eoarchean came from?
Great content! Please keep up the amazing work!
If my math is right, at this time scale you could fit around 3,000 human lifetimes into a single blink of your eyes!
The music gives me age of mythology vibes. Fantastically done!
TIL that algae is the CEO of sex.
That sound is so amazing and never gets boring, deep Respekt for that
Music is quite Eric Prydz esque in the beginning. Love it
My favorite video of yours, thank you so much for sharing! I love you guys :)
I can now declare that I’ve witnessed 4.5 billion years of information, and am up for retirement.
Epic vid, I listened to it while i did HW
im gonna stick to the bible and aliens, this shit dont make sense, a planet the size of mars hit earth on caught onfire and became the moon, yeah ok, the earth would shatter.
Im saving this for in a few hours when i can get stoned and properly appreciate this
Where does the rain in the Eoarchean come from?
A 1 hour kurgzgesagt video?? I'm down for it
the sound is so relaxing
Applause for this page for making this video with no cuts for an ads💗
To think, us, the species that lasts a second on the geological timescale, could very well be the extinction event that erases, millions of years of carefully crafted evolution, because we have this incessant pathological need to "make line go up" at whatever the cost….
what an amazing video, thank u so much!
A blink of an eye. Our existence in this planet.
So how do I get ahold of these soundtracks?
Four years in the making? That's just plain nuts! A very cool video, though. All the birbs at the end of the vid also made it clear just how much labor went into this. My hat is off to you fine folks.
My vote for best video to watch high of the year.  Edit: I just took a 50 million year rip
outstanding! Great work
What a frigging masterpiece! Thanks to all the team for the endless effort that this must have taken! 👏
Amazing vidoe cant wait to pass this down for the next generation
@kurzgesagt Is the music from this available on Spotify?
fluffing loved it
Kurzgesagt is a master race of Internet. This video is insaneee
Ming boggling how much time has passed and how little we've been here for.  If the entire history of the earth was one day then one hour ago we were in the Jurrassic period.
😍
Earth is 7k years old 😊
Love this! Hope to see more long form videos with story telling.. I support you with love ❤
Awesome! Not gonna lie, I did skip some of the parts (those where nothing happened ;))
I want those years back.
why’s this dude yapping so much about how long it took for life to become “cool”? it’s mad annoying
How come I'm able to watch this video in a minimized window although I don't have YT premium?
Thank you for putting relativity into an amazing perspective. If you need a classroom of testers and scientists worthy of your projects let me know, I’d love to collaborate. You’ve outdone yourselves with this. 🎉
Isn't it fascinating that it took several hundred billion years just for the earth's condition is perfect enough to carry life within
Fantastic! This is exactly what I needed to get a feel for all the deep time scales I've been learning. My 10-year-old watched the whole thing with me 💜
So if the Earth's orbit changes speed and a year is one orbit...is "4.5 bil" years all 365 days long or is there a ratio/fluntuation calculated for?
Sections of the music here sound very post-metal.  Very similar to a band called “The Ocean” that ironically have recorded 4 albums that deal with the ages of the Earth. (“Precambrian”/“Phanerozoic 1: Palaeozoic”/“Phanerozoic 2: Mesozoic/Cenozoic”/“Holocene”)  Many of the track names are the names of the segments in this video.    Excellent band.
"hi you're on a rock floating in space"
thank you so much for this wonderful video you guys brought to us for free! Been watching this for the past few days. Every time I eat a meal or snack I make sure to continue from where I left off <3    I'm hoping you guys will never ran out of idea and passion for making educational videos like this.
Absolutely fantastic! And the Jeff Goldblum quote from Jurassic Park just makes me love you guys even more! Can't wait to see what's next!
I can't believe they have this footage
That was amazing. Thank you very much for all of your work.
I love EVERYTHING about this.  The animation, the music, the dedication, the science, it’s PHENOMENAL!!!!  Instant 👍 and subscriber!
I was looking for a good playlist of tracks to listen to while playing chess and I just found it. Great music!!
The video looks awesome, however it feels quite empty since most of the interesting stuff happens in the last five minutes. It would have been nice if some parts would have gone faster and others slower
If you think about it, for a good chunk of earth's history, is literally just hell.
Insanely beautiful to see how our planet spent most of it’s time without us.
G.E.N.I.U.S. from techno to 8 bit pop and post rock. You nailed it, amazing job 🤯. Congrats on your anniversary!! 🎉
I need a version with just the video, music, sound but no talking.  I will loop it forever!
Kurzgesagt at 13:44: "Good job if you are still watching." Me: 👍
This film really brings my back to my boyhood interest in paleontology and geology. Really gorgeous.
this is right up there with "the history of the entire world i guess" by bill wurtz.
This is so kul
to be honest i had to play this in 2x speed my tik tok attention span was making this hard to watch lol
thanks now I'm sad I won't know the future
Had to pause in the middle of the Paleoarchean era, didn't want to miss anything!
i also endured commercials for several million years. that must have been a whole lot of cash for you guys.
changing your science teacher's voice with his makes the lesson so much more enjoyable.
This is epic.   This is why I am living in the year 12023. ❤
This should be played as a rave.
Wow that was amazing!
nice
I cant even understand a million years, and those are the seconds, I still feel I'm short at getting it
Really need this video in Hindi (I want to show this to my family)
Carl Sagen vibes
What an absolute masterpiece! Well done to all involved in making this. A lot of love clearly went into it and it truly shows!
SPLENDID
this is exactly what i needed. Good work, Kurzgesagt!
1 hour of animating, I liked and commented before the ad was over
crazy
Amazing video! Would love to see one of the history of the universe aswell!!
It takes me hours to edit short 3-10 minute hiking videos for my channel, and thats super basic. I can't imagine how long it took to Brainstorm, wrote, animate, and narrate something this long and In-Depth. Really looking forward to watching this. Thank you for your work!
Skip to 0:59:59 for the good stuff
Impressions during this incredible hour: - The Hadean is absolutely scary for how long it was 😶 - 12:50 "this may be place where life first developed"... cool!🤩 ........ 12:54 "but we don't know"... oh 😶 - 19:10 "you will basically die immediately in this athmosphere"... why does it sound cool anyway? - Siderian = bacteria farts saved the world - Orosian: we are mid-way and basically we only had farting bacteria. - 52:36 that is a sponge!!! - 53:43 that is the coolest fossil animal ever: anomalocarys! - From 55:46 everything is so wonderful, and all happened so "shortly" - 59:49 the dinosaurs-killing meteor effects lasted less then 1 second (1.5 milions years) Wonderful video ❤
6 figure trucks, zero retirement savings; the American Way.
All of human history, but a quick glance.
This is just theoretically
With such a timeline, it feels like the first humans aren't our oldest of the oldest ancestors, but they're our brothers.
i wish we all got a ticket to experience the last 4.6 billion years of our planet in the final hour of our lives
can we think about what the bible thinks how the earth was made? the story goes with science less god. and more believing the world was made with the big bang, but nothing can be make with nothing,
Music slaps hard
please do a german version of it ^^
Brilliant. Ty for working on this just to share with us. 🙏🏽
I just started watching but I love the premise and presentation of this video!
Anyone notice that they used a song they made on a previous video about dinosaurs in the cretaceous section of the video
Reminds me of the music video of Fatboy Slim - Right here, right now.
got halfway through, gonna go play Minecraft. I'll watch the rest at school, not that you need to know.
Insane animation and brilliant video! Thanks for feeding to our knowledge!
the music was great！
Amazing video, thank you!
it was great!!! ᕦʕ •ᴥ•ʔᕤ
This is just amazing 🎉 and 100% i am gonna watch the hole video
THIS MUSIC IS FIREEEEEEEEEEE
Incredible work. Nice music and the narrator has this incredibly chill voice which just adds to the atmosphere. The graphics are also incredible though there is repetition. My only complaints is that in the first segments there seems to be much more explanation of what caused the transition than later on.   Overall, this should be sold a demo material for tv shops and I'm general OLED tvs. Especially the beginnings was incredibly beautiful.    Respect
F minor pentatonic guitar scale sounds awesome with this in the like 10-20 minute range, pretty fun to jam along to with some goofy guitar effects. Ty kurzgy cool video.
Straight up the best youtube video ive watched
Same video but just with the music soundtrack, please. I'd love to keep it in the background without the voice over.
❤️
Amazing video 🎉
I am not sure how much the viewer understands, but I would hazard that if they used math to generate the effects, then this video would not have taken “years” to make. Generating procedural code to make the animation might even make the process easier.
Where can I get a playlist of the "sounds of earth"?
Epic soundtrack!!!!!!! greetings from Mexico!!!!
0:33 start
Beautiful 😭😭👍...i would have loved if they animated the "mass extinctions" especially the asteroid part (i was waiting for that)..but..ya can't have everything ...i truly appreciate this
Where the holes at?
Thats no moon?
Hit the hammer and Bowser goes in the chicken soup!
Are We There Yet : Remake Remix
When they uncover the great brown stain where San Francisco used to be they will call it the Anthro-poo-scene,
The earth was a sun at some point
the all of history
Incredible creation, this channel is doing great work for years. I'm a big fan.
The new NNN
I love you guys so much… this is amazing
Add potatoes and a pinch paprika
The Sun was the 1st air fryer!
Wouldnt evolution time of the earth go slower if the video was sped up?
Life, uhhh finds a way.
Incredibly trippy and a very welcome absence of politics.
Mesoarchean sounds like doom music.
Lava takes so longgg
Loved it! Had it playing all the way through while working. My hat off to the whole team behind this! 🎩
Thank YOU do much. Wow. Everything, the music really did it's thing on me. Bravo, bravo !
Wow! Gods miricle sure is grand! Whyd you make it so long though?
Right here Right now
The piano and the choir at the end is so good. It hits you right in the feels. And I got to say, the sound/mix of the drum kit in the sound track, especially the snare drum, is right on!
cant wait for the non repetitive 36 hour version
This is a video to be timeless here on YouTube.
Youtube gave me an ad.. 15 million years passed! 😮
45:00 ayyy yo sex got invented
I believe this is guess work
Did you know that time passes slower the faster you move?
great
It'd be cool if Kurzgesagt made a wallpaper for wallpaper engine
WOW!!
7:15 does that mean the "goldilocks zone" would of been more skewed towards Venus at this time?
It was like a meditation… everyone who combats with short attention span should take up the challenge to watch the entire video without getting distracted.The focus, the knowledge, the thoughts…
This kind of video happens once or twice in your lifetime.
I never brushed my teeth for 240 million years before. I think they might be clean now.
props to the camera man
Great !!
I watched it, and then I immediately watched it again. This is my new favourite video on the whole of the internet
I think this is a brilliant way for people to understand deep time. A good percentage of the population just can't get their heads around actually how long it takes for life to evolve, and change over massive amounts of time. And just lazily default to alternative, but incorrect ideas instead.
wow is like watching a documentary
Just amazing. I never comment on stuff but this was honestly fantastic
Imagine believing that the world is billions of years old
29:43  glitch
so your telling me the Stenian period was “the sex update?”
So in a nutshell: "let earth cook".
Am I watching a Kurzgesagt video or am I playing Donkey Kong Country? Either way, great job!
This is what I have been studying since 2019 also.   From the bottom of my heart, thanks.
47:57 You hired Tool for the music track, did't you? :)
INCREDIBLE
We are all but children of the stars.
Wonderful, real special, and a real gift.
Worst 1-hour video I watched in my life.
Honestly... Kudos to this video. But Damn! Whoever wrote this music is a genious!
It is very good but i wold reale like to see the second parte of this i know It is to much tu ask but the most fun part IS the humans one
This isn't just one hour of history This is one hour of pure vibes
DANG 45min out of the hour is when sex was invented 😂😂
I would like a link to just the music so I don't feel bad for not watching the animation
came for the science, stayed for the music
very nice idea
So relaxing it made me fall asleep. Slept through all of my classes for today.
This sounds like the Stanley parable ultra deluxe edition bottomless pit music
I can't believe you got TOOL to play on your soundtrack
@billwurtz made one in 9 minutes
these beats where 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just spent one hour of my allotted time on this planet watching this video - an hour that in the vast scale of things (like this video shows) is absolutely nothing. But it was still an hour of my life - and it's easily one of the very best hours I've ever spent online. Totally worth it, in every conceivable way. Excellent work from Kurzgesagt, as always.
Thank you all for the amazing content
dayum. this was almost as accurate as bill wurtz video
Love the music at 19:30 sounds like an unreleased tool song
is there a music and commentary free version? like only the sound effects and video?
i have to commemorate yall for the dedication to this and the quality of animation and yall just making it for everyone for free, yall deserve more then just a compliment yall deserve a prize
Not gonna lie, the soundtrack is fire, a mix between Terraria, Axiom Verge and probably something else, but still LIT as the younglings would say!
My favourite part was when sex was invented 😏
I remember the largest star comparison, cancer , and exploding a nuke on the moon. Kurzgesat still makes great content.👍
The floor is lava lol
I don't know why, but around the triasic and paleogene eras I just felt like crying. It really sunk in just hoe much of a blink of an eye we, ans even thr dinosaurs, were around for.
bill wurtz is four parallel universes ahead of you guys
Spoilers:  dont blink at the end
Make this a wallpaper ----->
„The floor is lava“ 😄😄😄
It’s crazy because as I understand it, by us being able to choose chapters in this video and navigate to any point in its total time over and over or not at all we are effectively demonstrating the concept of the 4th dimension and 4th dimensional beings.  Please someone reply to this and correct or throw more in.
What a wonderful way celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the Channel... as usual a great video. Congrats with the 10 years! 🎉
and then gta 6 was released
This video is your MAGNUM OPUS!!!
I still think Germans normally use “kurz” for something that is far less than an hour
Just watched the whole thing, wonderful sound design, props to the animators as well!
4.5 billion years into the past
reminds me of the voice from How it's made series.🙂
C'est absolument génial, vous êtes véritablement une pépite kurzgesagt.
The first soundtrack is super lit when played at 1.25x - it’s like I’m at a dance party
We need the same video about the evolution of the human species!!!
How do ye come up with these ideas 👏 👏 👏
Man this music sounds like sub-nautica
The Cretaceous part was one of the most beautiful things I have experienced in a video 😮
Do another of this for human history please.
Incredible video
PLEASE TRANSALETE YOUR MERCH TO SPANISH!!!!!!
Astounding
Thank you for this,  it was superb.
someone answer a quick question. . . how is there absolutely no oxygen in the environment when an ocean of H20 has existed for millions of years? should be quite a few ways for it to get split.
This is so stunning. One of the best works of Kurtzgezagt. If I can't sleep this is the best remedy. If I want to be productive, same!
Basically what i do is worthless so just enjoy the ride! WHEEEEE
a beautiful presentation, an excellent and remarkable video from you guys as you always do!
Feels like it was just yesterday that Theia tore a huge chunk off the planet to make an unnaturally large celestial body in its place, time sure does fly, huh!
bro let a time for discuss with some friend during the video
At 41:30, the voice says THICCens 😂. I like the way it was said
Using this as my visuals while I listen to Precambrian right now
Omg these need to become wallpapers, lock screens, and screensavers!!! I BEG YOU!!! I WILL BUY THEM!!!
Great job guys! I really like this channel
Absolutely gorgeous! It's a long one, but I enjoyed every 1.5 million years of it!
This is great, but I really wish they would be a more condensed version. Minutes of watching while nothing changes without any comments most of the time - phew.
People who watched the whole thing without ever pausing (great video btw, thks a lot)  I  I \/
Fantastic
A-tier music.. Imma need this track on Spotify 🔥
You should do one of these for human history!
“Life is thriving. Such a paradise. Nothing can go wrong. Wait, what’s that? *FLASH* And an asteroid killed all the dinosaurs and most life on Earth. Such a bummer.” Top tier writing 🤣 Love it! This was amazing, thank you so much!
Lucky to exist at the same time as Kurzgesagt!
watching this and zoning into the periods of earth's life need some of these as locks screens for my cellphone. And that mesoarchean oat was so good i had to workout to it. Great job Kurz and team.
could have had more detail on the ottoman empire
<3
Wow, I'm really enjoying this!
Wierd that back then a lightning strike would take about half a million years.
Props to the cameraman for walking through all this
Nice
Who here watched the entire 4.5 billion years? hell ya kurzgesagt!!
*me waiting for the impact at **33:58* "..."
Wann deutsch lan
I am too stupid not to know the answer to this but I had to ask. Are all the theories/science in this video shown is scientifically proven? or Its just a theory because it sounds logical.
Thank you so much for making this ❤
Lo espero en español pliz
Ah yes the earth. So good and beautiful. This already took my 30 million years to get to this part of this comment and, earth is full (meteor hits and kills dinosaurs) of life. What a beautiful place to live! It took my 122 million years to finish this comment
A short explanation of the names of each period would have been beneficial for the laypersons. That said, solid work.
Best channel ever 👍🏻
The best video I've ever seen on YouTube.
Wow. This is new kind of content: video for the back ground.
That was absolutely incredible. Killer soundtrack ❤
on the 29:44 there is a visual glitch y?
yeah i'm supposed to be asleep for 4 hours now
3:50 ay ay ay 🕺🕺
THE FLOOR IS LAVA
watched it all very lit
Club kurzgesagt 🔥
The oldest Lunar anorthosites are 4.4 Ga old. Yet, I am not seeing the formation of the anorthosite flotation crust on the Moon at this time. Instead, we see something slowly cooling over like 300 Ma. This is pretty inaccurate. A global anorthosite layer likely formed and cooled fairly rapidly. You might say, "Well, this video is on the Earth." To which I'd say, we don't have anything that old that paints a picture of the Earth, while we have a ton of information on the Moon, and arbitrarily sepating the Earth-Moon system does a disservice to its history.  You might also say something about the Late Heavy Bombardment, ~4.1-3.8 Ga. Now, you might dispute that it even happened; it might just be the tale-end of accretion, but a lot of ink has been spilled on this topic, so it deserves mention.  You should check out the papers on viscosity changes driven by Snowball Earth glaciation causing multicellularity to arise. "We're not sure" how life survived during the Cryogenian is not entirely accurate.  The "Cambrian Explosion" is a fossil horizon in which abundant fossils are concentrated. There is evidence for multicellular life way before 550 Ma, and this deserves mention
masterpiece
heart emoji*100
It`s weird. I always knew this. To be finally able to experience it is awesome.
Wooooooooooooooooooooow
Mesoarchean prog riffs are just awesome. Musical and visual journey
This really puts time into perspective
Events/narrator comments list  0:42 Theia impact and formation of Moon, begining of Hadean era 1:32 Atmosphere of Hadean Earth, no solid ground, just lava 2:05 Congrats, 90 mln years have passed 2:47 Zircons and early water on Earth 6:47 Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) begins. Many craters on Moon and other planets formed at this period 7:12 Sun is 30% cooler than nowdays, but it's ok, cause lots of greenhouse gases are still in the Earth's atmosphere. Great place to go on vacation. 8:05 Eoarchean begins 8:15 Life emerges 8:35 Earth cools down enough for a first rain, which lasts millions of years 12:43 The cradle of Life 13:18 Paleoarchean begins, formation of continents below the water. Earth spins like a pinwheel, but do not worry, Moon will soon slow it down by it's gravity 13:42 Congrats, 1 billion years have passed 17:50 Stromatolites as a first evidence of life 18:00 Photosyntesis begins, bacterias will produce oxygen, but 99% of it goes for oxidation of various minerals (iron, etc.) That's why it took so long for GOE 18:35 Mesoarchean begins, era of continents, which constantly collide with each other 18:56 But oceans still feel like your everyday bath, 40 Celsius. Nice conditions for microbes and hell for misophobic 19:10 Anyway, you will die immediately 23:50 Neoarchean begins. Life develops further 24:34 Prokaryotes begin to expand on Earth, but no multicellular life still =( 27:46 Siderian begins, the GOE (Great Oxydation Event) is coming. During this event, most of anaerobic life died out, paving the way for aerobic life 29:38 Cause no minerals left to oxide, oxygen produced by aerobic bacterias begins to interact with methane in Earth's atmosphere, replacing it with CO2 and H2O 30:15 First glaciation arrives. First of many 30:24 Rhyacian begins 31:13 During glaciation cycles volcanos produce greenhouse gases and heat Earth. Some new stuff with melted ice comes to the oceans and gives boost to life. After that, cycle of weathering repeats and new glaciation begins again.  33:41 Orosirian begins 33:48 Impact of asteroid creates Vredefort crater, oldest and biggest (disputed by Wilkes Land crater) verified crater on Earth. It is located in RSA. 34:47 Formation of Ur, Nena and Atlantica - maybe first mountain ranges 36:57 Statherian begins 37:00 Formation of Columbia - first supercontinent ever 39:38 Calymmian begins 39:40 Somewhere here Eukaryotic cell has formed. It means an era of multicellular life has begun 41:35 Earth's crust thickens and oceans become shallower, which means more landmass can be appeared simultaneously 41:40 Fungi things by first fungi-like organisms 42:15 Ectasian begins, formation of Earth's inner core 44:51 Stenian begins, first-ever sex scene on Earth 47:30 Tonian begins, 1 bln years before nowdays, but life is still not visible 50:06 Evolution creates first predator, begining of everlasting arms race between hunters and prey. It boosts diversity even further tho 51:11 Cryogenian begins, Earth is a literally snowball. Earth freezes and un-freezes several times due to the process I've mentioned above. Check Snowball-Earth hypothesis for more info.  52:18 Ediacaran begins, formation of Gondwana supercontinent. it included Africa, South America, Antartica, Australia and some other minor parts 53:15 Life grows big and multicellar revolution begins. One of the consequences of Snowball Earth event, which leads to 53:35 Cambrian explosion, followed by Ordovician extinction 54:17 Ordovician begins 54:48 Silurian begins 55:00 Plants expand on land and create soil, eating CO2 in the process 55:07 Devonian begins 55:38 The sun is not a deadly lazer anymore, so we can go on land now 55:54 Carboniferous begins, era of forests, which will transorm into a coal burned by humans overtime 56:11 Things get faster now 56:42 Permian begins, form of Pangea, the last supercontinent 56:50 Somewhere here The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time has happened. It opened the road for dinosaurs tho 57:20 Triassic begins, marking the begining of Dinosaur's era 57:40 oh hey, the dinosaur! 58:01 Jurassic begins, dinosaurs are at the point of their highest heyday 58:09 You can see an ancestor of pigeon running through the forest 58:46 Cretaceous begins 59:20 Earth gets more and more familiar 59:38 Chicxulub incoming and destroys a dinosaur's paradise 59:48 Paleogene begins, extinction of dinosaurs paves way for mammals 1:00:21 Neogene begins, last glaciation era started 1:00:38 Quternary begins, do not blink please 1:00:45 End
history of the entire world i guess?
Y'all should consider releasing a version without music!
This is just the longer version of the history of the world I guess
Outstanding piece of work, thank you! Really puts our existence as a specie into perspective …
didn't expect such an awesome BGM
I would really love if you uploaded a second version with some more statistics, like temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, maybe even other cool approximations like number of cells, or volcanic eruptions per 100.000 years, even though that could only be very vague estimates
Ich brauche das in deutsch 😭❤️
This is such a good and creative idea, I love it
love it!
Lo-fi chill electronic geological timescale beats to relax/study/experience existential dread to.
@kurzgesagt Please turn this into a 24 hour live stream with similar lofi music throughout!
4491 Million Years Ago: „… and the floor is lava.“ 😂 Bet this one was intentional!
We're really just a flash of activity in the grand scheme of things, huh
Well done, ducks
All of human history happened and then there was an ad break
"The egg" was a beginning. Now you've truly achieved art!
Thanks for that beautiful video! <3
Super cool! Enjoyed it!
Life is so old but also so new  Also never appreciated just how much of an explosion the Cambrian really was!
Music reminds me a lot of Risk of Rain.
make a second in 1 hour
A (modern) human lifetime took about 1.6 pico seconds in this video. 1.7 trillionth of a second
bro how do people dislike this? This is literally kurzgesagt for an hour. Love the work thats been put into this :)
It's like I'm playing Galaga.
This will now be my go-to ambient music/video for work.
best channel on youtube. AMAZING!
A long journey in 0.000000000000025 part of it.
Took that fish about 10 million years to swim across the screen
now we getting into the internet era, kinda hype, it should appear in the tip of the 0:03 timeline right after moon expeditions
It would be awesome to see one of these but from the big bang to present day
1:32 Playing the floor is lava must have been pretty challenging during the Hadean.
So...what you are saying is that the Earth's temperature heated up without Humans causing it?  This video should be banned.
And to think people expect intelligent life to exist within light centuries of our planet when most of our planets life was lava or cells AND we’ve almost gone extinct in the ice age, the Cold War, and now with extreme climate change. Don’t hold your breath people, there’s a lot of filters lol
Where is Adam and Eve!?
The proof that the cameran never dies.. ☠️☠️
human history was mid
Someone know the name of the ending music ?
1:00:39 We are so insignificant.
i have been watching you guys since the beginning and im never disappointed. Every penny spent to support you guys is worth it <3 keep up the amazing work
ive seen this story so many times, but the soundtrack is killer! thumbs up!
This is insanely good, the animation, the music, 😍
this is art
This is a nice entire album full of engaging background music.
Wow, thats the history of the entire world. I guess...
Now do the same for the universe 13bn yrs
Someone on the audio design team is a Mick Gordon's fan and I'm all for it
came to expirience 4.5 billion years  stayed for the badass music
Came for science. Stayed for music 😵‍💫
Soooooo gooooood loved the music ❤
53:14 so it begins...
During Paleoarchen. Does the day or night matter? cause it seem the energy source is constant. And most life form here is rely on the energy from the earth core instead of rely on the sun radiation.
The bg music is also a masterpiece.😊
As a geology and ecology student: wow! This is truly great, and such a helpful way to learn and really put things in perspective!  Also as a geology and ecology student: I have more questions now than i did when i started watching :)))
imo science is just good at pretending it knows a lot in this area
The best part was where he said "Its mammal time" and started to mammal all over the place
Human history: Blink!
This is such an incredible idea for a video
Watched it all when i was alone at work. Very nice background.  Would defently love to see more of this.  Maby one for human history.  Or for the future of the universe. Although i think its better to have a logaritmic scale for that one.
The background sounds and music seems as if if was calculated to drive the viewer insane. At the beginning the first five notes repeated over and over and over is maddening
Why is in the video top right corner written "million"? I'm confused...
Is this a parody of bill wurtz "history of the entire world, i guess"?
Can you make an option to choose audio with only music, without the commentary? I find the video and music great as a background for studying and/or working, but the commentary distracts me (even though I love it I'd appreciate an option to switch it off)
for free?
truth is God created everything (Genesis 1:1) but cool video though
Great video, thanks for Kurzgesagt for such outstanding content 🎉
This is unbelievable: the music, the animation, everything is perfect ❤️❤️
There is already the history of the entire world (I guess) which only took like 20 min
Brilliant.
1hour of bullshit...
you guys make THE BEST content out there right now! none of this mindless TikToks that turns my brain into diarrhoea. 👍
wonderful work! thank you so much!
this doesnt help me getting up for work tomorrow...
This was epic! I’m glad I saw this!
I think the music really elevated this video. It transitions seamlessly between each era and captures the mood the animation has.
Wow. The passion that went into this is amazing!.
This needs a 4 hour version   ...not asking much ;)
I have corrected a lot of my knowledge about the history of the Earth and gained new information.. thank you so much
Its an eye opening experience , it's diligence.
Just watch “the entire history of the world, i guess” by bill wurtz
51:50 portal 2 music ??
love the music and thank you for all ur educational content
i love whoever made the music this is absolute moneysauce
Thank you!❤
Superb!!!!!!!!!
Wow, absolutely incredible. It really is amazing how quickly everything from the Precambrian onward goes by compared to everything that came before...
This video is awesome. I have to rewatch this
For anyone interested, around 45:00 (or around 4.050.000.000 after the start of the Hadean period) sex was invented.
insane, I love it
This feels inspired by German progressive metal band "The Ocean" 😍😍
Is this narrated by the same person as 'How its made'?
Not gonna lie, the music was sick. Could totally release this as an album.
This video is amazing! 👏🏼 but could you add Spanish subtitles?, I'm from Mexico and I want to show this to my family 😭🫶🏼
The music is especially amazing! Absolutely mind blowing project!
Thank you for this ride. Thank you. We need more of this.
Bless you for this :-)
What a video! Hats off to you guys! Btw, I blinked and missed 😀
Music kicks ass on top of all complements you guys received.
Is this the reason the rest of their video ideas have been lackluster? or is it just the big corperate funding going to work?
Hard to believe that we have destroyed billions of years of progress in just a few centuries.
🇵🇸you dont have to be muslim to support Palestine you juste have to be a human💓
59:55 such a boomer
We really are so new, I had never really appreciated that before now.
Amazing to say the least!
Where did all the rain in the EOARCHEAN age come from?
файна музика) насолода для вушей давно не слухав таку
This is a beautiful video, just like everything Kurtgesagt make. What I didn't expect is that I needed music that sounds like a mashup of Tool and Marconi Union expertly crafted by Epic Mountain.
Love you guys
Amazing work
This is a masterpiece. I watched every second of it and I'm literally crying. Wow. 👏🏼
Love it, thank you guys!
This would have been so much better without the punishingly bad music.
Video: 4bln years of Earth's history.  The general peoples attention span: 11.5seconds
You sure that's how the moon got there?
Can't believe the credits lasted for 181 million years!
Used the whole video to do a cardio workout. The most epic 4.6 billion years I have spent. I am jacked now.
I will put this as my screen saver
What a master piece and party for my mind
This is the masterpiece video on YouTube
This was amazing oh my gosh!
вы огромные молодцы
Just incredible
Exceptional. Already done like n subscribe
Hats off!
chat is this real
Sooooo... Sex was invented by algae 1.2 BILLION years ago Thank you algae.
people will trip to this
Educational, entertaining and trippy AF.  Superb production from the gorgeous visuals to the superbly composed soundtrack.  Flawless
i love kurhsbixdid!!!! i still dont know how to write this channels name after years tho
At 20 mins I thought the doom music was about to kick in
I loved it! Thanks for your work in this years
soundtrack is awesome!
E
That's Earth's timeline... in a nutshell
No evidence what so ever of illogical statements such as the earth being billions of years old. None. Show me something. How can Nothing create everything? Where did it come from ? Don’t mix your subjective reality with objective reality.
you forgot the part where "human made climate change" doomed the whole planet...
amazing!!!!
4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour We showed up for just 1 single second
I wonder how many meetings the gods had to have in order to get to the point where life finally was made, evolved and diversified.
This video is amazing! Now do the same for the universe and the milky way galaxy.
I really really hope they didn't use WOKE names for the Eons, Periods, Eras and Ages. That would make me furious. I love things traditional.  I hate change.
What actually gets me the most is that on the youtube timeline, life as we know it, even the dinosaurs are found only at the very end, a very small fraction of the entire timeline. Makes me appreciate how special we are.
❤❤❤
Watching while high
Watch this at 2X speed and it will take 30 minutes.
I feel like this is going to be an awesome feature in introductory geology courses around the globe! 💞🌎💞
29:41 look at the bottom of the screen, for me there is a glitch, I keep setting the video back but it happens again.
I think people are like the eyes and the conscience of the Universe. After so much time with so many things going on without anybody around to see or understand, the Universe thought it needs an audience. So intelligent life was created. For the Universe, nothing really is exciting, as it doesn't have emotions, feelings or senses. To understand this just remember that outer space is absolute silence.
The Earth is actuality only 4,499,999,999 years old not 4,500,000,000
The frequency of notes in the music here is around 1000Hz. So the period of the sine wave of the SOUND ITSELF corresponds to 1000 years 😮. Just imagine as a guitar strings vibrates a millennium passes each string vibration.   The computer chip in your phone steps at ~1GHz frequency, which corresponds to 1/1000 a year or 3 steps per day.
I vibe like the first day of being a supernova, thanks Kurzgesagt!
@bill_wurtz did it in 20 min 6 year ago. But i won't juge before watching the video.
This video is amazing! But damn, these songs are bangers.
I could just listen to the music for the hour, sick beats!
Wow this is incredible! Thanks so much for y'all's hard work! I salute you o7
To anyone who is reading this just give the video a like for all the effort they put into this
This is the coolest video on YT
They ALMOST nailed this in the bible.
Watching this at 2x speed, so I can get 4.5 Billion years in half an hour.
I appreciate the sense of humor at the end - "Don't blink..."
nuh uh
The music is in the best quality I've ever heard
loved this. Thanks
Love this one. Great music as well. 🦾🎶💜
yoooooo, can the next vid be another ant one? lol
Wow thanks ❤
As a father of a 1 year old, it's very helpful to me to learn and absorb, so I can pass the correct information to my kid. Thank you.
Masterpiece
For me this is somehow, one of the best videos from you, so far. ❤
Dumest video ever
This video reminded me of bill wurtz 😂
It's amazing. 1 hour animation for free... It's a huge gift for everybody. Coolest video ever on youtube
Simply the best
For hundreds of millions of years there is nothing but lava and the  suddenly it rains for millions of years? Where did that water come from?
As if it took since 2019 to create this video. Insane work you did on this
props to god for doing all this so we can study it now.
the greatest video in the history of youtube! congratulations to all of you!
No one is talking about the music?? I had no idea prog rock started to appear in the Mesoarchean period.
gotta love cyano bacteria
Probably the real successor of koyanisqaatsi. Now you’ve reached an amazing new level. Congratulations guys.
Another incredible video. Thank you for always making amazing content.
Ectasian gives me some serious Tool vibes.
German politics think they can affect those processes 🤡 they're ready to put you down in misery, like it matters or something... SAVE US from delusion, someone pls!
You are amazing. I have never seen the history of the earth so well told. Thanks
Horrifying to see how long it took to get here, how fast it developed in the last 100 years and how we fuck it up
I really wanna watch this entire thing all the way but it's late and i have class tomorrow lmao
❤❤
im reading your book immune to this
At this point, kurzgesagt is just flexing how good his animating skills are...
19:40 When the Doom Eternal Soundtrack starts coming in during Mesoarchean, should have used that for Hadean :)
Eoarchean
amazing video thank you KURZ
Just blinking my eyes, shit I missed thousands of years of incidents 💀💀
Art
hmm i should study!!🤗 *4.5 billion years in an hour *
Don't skip the first half of this video! The music is good.
This reminds me of melody sheep’s journey to the end of time, both timeless
Hadean ⚪⚪
I stepped away to get a cup of coffee and completely missed the Mesoarchean era. 😆
Hadean
I thought that "... in 1 Hour" is just a metaphor :D
One second in this video represent more than one million years.
It's the same video. Seems like it's 4.5 billion years.
Who was in the Studio? They did a great Job
The music has me feeling like I'm playing Terraria
Boy, how time flies.
So... Just a second ago we appeared and now earth is a mess thanks to the 1% of humans?
Now i need one like this but with the history of the universe
Wow. Simply wow. Maybe the best video YouTube ever. On par with what I expect from David Attenborough  Amazing stuff. Didn’t blink.
I didn't saw kind of this ever intire of my life. This such AWSOME. I can't emagine how much get efforted to make this film. masterpiece.
Love listening to the music while doing my work, it sounds like I’m playing Risk of Rain 2
51:10 "ICE AGE" - Aokiji, One Piece.
A genesis device and the U.S.S. Reliant would have sped this up.
This was a surprisingly emotional and humbling experience.
but i thought it world was 6000 years old 😂😂😂😂😂   amazing video btw best thing i have seen in a long time !
what a great meditative experience!
Not really sure on why there's suck a clear Doom reference...
Magnum opus
the Mesoarchean was fkn DJENT!
The music is beautiful.
This was amazing guys!
Youtube ads last at least 1 million years
Animation Error at 10:36
In this era where social media is full of Shitload of 15 second bullshit content. Videos like this is like a holy grail. 😊
Whoever did the music for this one went nuts in the best possible way
This Has Got To Be One Of The BEST VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE!!! EVER!!! <3 <3 This video was just exquisitely captivating! I don't suppose it was easy to make it at all. This video is spectacular mix of three things: History, Animation, and Music. And the coolest thing about this video was how it put these three things together so well! It was mind-blowing! Splendid Experience!!
You people are crazy!! What a video, what a production, a 1 hour animated video 🤯!! I couldn't be more grateful with this kind of video. You made a really really REALLY good job. Congrats to the team!!
I love it but I miss an indicator for the temperature, air composition and overall conditions for life 😊
Can't wait for the universe version of this video!
What is the song they used for the tonian period?
I love this so much
A masterpiece
Would've been nice to know the atmosphere composition, surface temperature etc in each age
Could you do a history of centralized banking?
🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🌍 Overview of Earth's Age - Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and the video aims to make this timespan comprehensible by presenting it as a one-hour musical train ride through Earth's history. 01:06 🔥 Hadean Eon: Earth's Early Conditions - 4.5 billion years ago, in the Hadean Eon, Earth was a hell of lava with a mostly CO2 atmosphere. - The collision with Theia formed the moon, which will gradually shrink over millions of years. 08:42 🌊 Formation of Oceans and Early Life - Oceans begin to form around 4 billion years ago, with the possibility of life originating near hydrothermal vents. - Stromatolites and evidence of early photosynthesis mark the emergence of life in the Paleoarchean. 27:57 🌬️ Great Oxidation Event - Cyanobacteria trigger the Great Oxidation Event around 2.5 billion years ago, introducing oxygen to the atmosphere. - Oxygen reacts with methane, causing a cooling effect and initiating a period of multiple ice ages. 41:42 🌱 Evolution of Life Forms - Eukaryotic cells emerge around 1.6 billion years ago, a crucial step in the evolution of life. - The Statherian sees the formation of the supercontinent Columbia and a natural nuclear reactor. 51:25 ❄️ Cryogenian and the Cambrian Explosion - Earth freezes over in the Cryogenian around 720 million years ago. - The Cambrian Explosion, 539 million years ago, witnesses the rapid diversification of life forms, including the emergence of multicellular organisms. 58:02 🦕 Age of Reptiles and Mass Extinctions - The Triassic marks the age of reptiles, with dinosaurs becoming dominant. - The Permian sees Pangea forming, leading to the largest mass extinction, while the Triassic brings the asteroid that kills the dinosaurs. 59:57 🌍 Paleogene to Present: Mammals and Human History - Mammals take over in the Paleogene, 66 million years ago. - Human history begins, with continents resembling today's and mammals dominating.
The belief that the earth is only 4.5 billion years old is founded on the same principle as the belief that god created the earth.
Can't believe the Jurassic period was just 176 million years ago! felt like yesterday!
❤
Ni de pdo esto llega luego a la versión en español, es mucho trabajo, me conformo con los subtítulos
Li am speechless
Absolutely amazing!
Es muy inspirador!
That the visuals would be incredible i already knew, but man this soundtrack is an 1hour bliss
I was mesmerised watching every second of this video. It is instantly one of my favourite youtube videos of all time. Thank you endlessly for creating this.
Truly amazing video. Great work
58:12 "Life, uh, finds a way." Nice.
Ah humanity, an end to everything.
Hey wonderful work! Is there a way to have access to the music on any form? Spotify &/or Deezer?
Where did rain came from? Where did first organisms came from?
If this video consist of many animations stiched together, how they do it so smoothly? And if it’s actually one continous animation, just how big is the project file is?
So long and boring, what a waste of time.
Millions of years of effort just so you can live depressed life right now.
Shout out to the camera man for survivng 4.5 billion years for us and capturing this amazing world as it was being created.
90% of earth's history - nothing really happens besides geology and single cell organisms. ~9.99998% remaining - the entire history of multi-cellular life before humans. 0.022% - Entire human evolution and all of human history. 0.00022% - history of human civilization since 10000 years ago.  If you keep following that it seems so obvious to me that rate of important events is so high today and still accelerating that we're basically living in singularity from evolution perspective. All of human inventions happen in a less than a millisecond of this video.  Skip ahead 1 second (1 million years!) and what we will see?  Type 3 civilization spread around universe populated by planet sized super intelligent beings? But more likely something our primitive minds can't comprehend yet?
wait, since 2019.....???  You guys are crazy....  You deserve all the supports...  love you, Kursgesagt...
I love that the soundtracks transition so slowly
I can't help but imagine a game, movie or book set in each of these eras. They all just look so fascinating the way they're animated! like, seriously, imagine a game set in the late Mesoarchaean era of an alien world where you're a farmer sent to harvest the newly-forming colonies of the planet's first Algea for instance!
Oh man, 3115 million years ago slaps
"Earth is 4.5 billion years old impossible for your brain to truly grasp"  Me watching in 2x speed: 🤔🤔🤔
Wow 1 hour of Kurzgeszagt Animation!!
Its unbelievable that it took so long for the first organism to even appear. We really are just a blink of an eye in the history of Earth. The growth was almost exponential toward the end, I can't even imagine what the next thousand year is going to look like with AI set to overtake us. I am simply speechless. Thank you for sharing this labor of love with us.
You make an Hour Long Video and somehow the Animation Looks Even More detailed and beautiful than before. Thanks so much for your content!
At a certain point, the music composer said "TOOL"
They should make more like this it’s amazing 🤩
Great educational video for students who's trying to learn about the past of our earth
The scale of how small we are is incredible! Reminds me of what Carl Sagan wrote about the Voyager 1 photo from 3.7 billion miles away, captured in 1990.  “That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.”
Props to the animators but the video is unnecessary long, some people juste don’t have the time to watch that kind of video and it’s sad to be kept away from its content
dang we have so much more time to go
As he said~~~EXPERIMENTAL EDITION as HOW can they PROVE this?
45:00 sex is invented. 🤣
(66 million) flashbang
1 hour Long Video? Oh Im watching all of That in one go😊
Good job.
cool it just none of this is true
thank you to the researchers, animators, creative leads and epic mountain for this scientific sensory masterpiece! (and of course the legendary steve taylor!)
Would love to see more of these.
So God didn’t do all of this in 6 days and rested on the 7th? 😮
leute geile animation und auch gut wiedergegebn für mich dummy aber die abstände in denen das script vorgelesen wurde war viiiiiieeeeel zunlangsam und weit auseinander, dann hätte man sich auch 10 min sparen können no offense
could you make a video with music only and background?
Respect! Realy good
"Don't blink or you might miss all of human history."  The end.  We are not even significant on Earth's level.
If an Alien were to inquire about the essence of true work-life balance, I would direct them to your channel. Your team exemplifies a harmonious blend of creativity and unwavering dedication. Thank you for being on the internet. 🌟
Amazing work from the animation team, an entire 1 hour long video filled with the tiniest details. I am indeed impressed
free palestine
You are the oldest channel I saw that is not dead. Most of the 10+ years channel are dead
Can we also have a version without any comment? For a sublime experience.
Really good video! Puts time into perspective.  Amazing to think that probably most of the atoms in our bodies existed through all these eras! Maybe an atom in my thumb was part of some big mountain 2.5 billion years ago 😂
Evolution is so fucking BS! 💩  Take it from an ex-evolutionist like me.
Doom music kicking in around 19:40 gave me the stank face. What an overall amazing experience otherwise!  As others have said, this is a huge investment of time and effort from the team and it is absolutely amazing.  Reminds me of seeing Fantasia for the first time. Instant classic.
Now some guy will come and say: NUH UH
মহাকাল যাত্রা ❤
HELL YEAH BROTHER MAN
That was beautiful. Thank you to the whole team!
I need a 4.5 billions years extended version.   Is it even possible to make a video so long?
it'S a chore to look at it but as ambiance while working, it's "chef'skiss"
This is so cool! Thank you so much for all this hard work! Could you please, please pretty please make a version without any spoken words? With speech it's hard to play it in the background while working etc. 🙂 Ah, and another idea. Have you thought about making the same thing for 400.000 years of human history? 39 minutes hunter and gatherers developing, discovering and conquering the world with all it's different continents and biotopes, (origins in Africa, hunting megafauna in Australia, sailing to the Hawaii islands, crossing the frozen bering sea, fighting and mating with the neanderthals...) and with all of the agricultural revolution and modern times in the last minute 🙂 Keep up the awesome work!
gonna sleep to this
Jetzt bin ich eindeutig eifersüchtig auf die Zuschauer vom Englischen kanal xD. Eine Stunde Kurzgesagt ist das beste was ich mir vor dem  schlafengehen vorstellen kann. Aber mein Englisch wird schon zum übersetzten reichen ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
caralho q FODAA parabéns pelo trabalho!
I do really love his, but i have suggestions for v2 for your next 10 year anniversary.   Adding a few info overlays might enhance it a bit - like having a little thermometer for  average ground level temperature.  Maybe a little piechart  for atmosphere gases. From the Paleoarchean onwards, each age abruptly transitions to the next, with apparently nothing changing  during.  I'm sure at least some of these changes where much more gradual, and would have been nice to see it gradually transition.  The Neoarchean was the worst, where you just show open water - which I don't think represented this era perticually well, and boring to look at.   For the early life sections, maybe a magnifying glass in the corner showing the key events would be nice.  And later (cambrian explosion), be nice if the evolutionary was clearer - it kinda felt like, suddenly 2 animals invented, then they stayed exactly the same for millions of years. Still, a great video!
Love this. Really hoping you’ll have a Re-Release without any dialogue.
the BEST video on you tube so far
자막!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video is worth in Gold !! 😍👍🏻
The 2week wait was worth it
I don’t think that I could look at a bottle of water the same ever again “you were here for all THAT?”
Life uh, finds a way.
The mesoarchean beat hits hard 💀
I kinda want to know why animals and plants for the most part can't drink salt water
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the music? Not only did they make an amazing animation for over an hour, they also composed good music for it. Kurzgesagt are such champions
I swear the music they use at the carboniferous time was my favorite song! WE LOVE YOU KURZGESAGT!!!!
Music is so gooooood! Epic Mountain done it again
You're amazinggg🔥
37:34 this looks so great i really like it 42:58 cool clouds
We just got an animated movie for free
i felt scared
Way too long. Net watching pictures for one hour. Could’ve made it shorter
4:15 Absolute banger
1 hour of animation taking a look at how our planet was created and how life came to be. Beautiful work as always. Must have taken ages planning and getting it finished, much love. Happy 10 years 💫
The incredinly long pauses are off putting.
Coolest and most unique video so far
I love you
3M views in 2 days wow
This is absolutely crazy, only a minute and a half in and I am completely amazed at how good the animations are. Incredible work as per usual
One hour? This deserves and Oscar
so you're telling me that it rained for millions of years, creating huge pools of liquid water, that the  thermal vents were enriching with minerals and chemicals that are the foundation of every shape of life today, while the earth was  constantly being bombarded with lightnings? No wonder life popped up, that's a reaaaally long time with a lot of things that could "spark" life up. Beatuiful video
This is what should be taught in history
shout out to the camera man for recording for 4.5 billion years
Thank you
The life of immortal entities is boring, most of the time. "The first billion years were the worst. The following billion years were also the worst. Then I entered a bad phase" - Marvin the Paranoid Android.
Amazing soundtracks as always.
the fact that they managed to make 1 hour of floor moving interesting is just so amazing.
1 hour..... I would 1000% prefer this than my history or science class
Out of 1 hour of the Earth's history, we, humans have existed like 0.2 seconds.  Yet, we humans act like the boss...😅
Geez
Every second felt like a million years. 10/10
God made the earth.
This is incredible. Such a video! Thanks guys. ❤
Wow that was awesome
this made me so emotional for some reason
im never watching this high again..
the atmosphere is mostly CO2 and the floor is lava.....great foreshadowing...also considering we thawed out a 46,000 year old worm and it started reproducing suggests.....life could easily survive being frozen over.
I can't help but feel like this video was rushed out for the 10th anniversary 🤔 Some sections could have had different landscapes, and some lack animation compared to others, which may be explained by the lack of activity, but that doesn't explain the unanimated water in some parts. Otherwise this is wonderful, I love this!
Finally a documentary I’ll stay interested in.
Wow
Everyone is giving props to the animators (and they deserve it), but the music is what really sets the mood here!
*Question:* Would it be too financially damning to "open source" the animation/graphic files so that the community can add onto this? Maybe have an animation of the Earth's core actually growing? Add more animals and plants, perhaps with labels. Maybe make the video twice as long, but only 500k years per second.   Oh, hell, if you have the whole community contributing, why not make it enormous and do 10k per second?! (Too lazy to calculate how long the video would be.) And you could play around with acceleration (not sure how you'd "show" that), maybe for some periods keep it 1M per second, but during more interesting periods (and ones we know more about), make it even 5k per second.  Point being, is if it is actually feasible, it might be amazing to see what the community can add to this already astonishingly beautiful video.  My first thought as to why this _isn't_ possible/a good idea is because a lot of trademark stuff would make it out into the world and then the knockoffs start and you have to go all Disney on everyone. No one wants to do that, have that done to them, or have to hire the entire bar of lawyers (and have to pay them).  Still, one can dream.
good but you need to explain everything in detail
if you dont mind me asking what is the song used in the mesoarchean?
This one is epic. I thought this was going to be boring and full of fast forwards. I enjoyed it fully!
I wanted to study with it, but the video is too amazing
Me watching 10 minutes worth of lava cooling down: "this is the best thing ever"   1 hour of kurzgesagt, must be early christmas
For sake of not made fun of constantly by the sentient cockroaches in the future, we need asteroid deflecting system asap.
My Greatest goal is to have $1m in my savings when i retire after this whole struggle.
wake up new Kurzgesagt video just driped
How are meteor possibile when there was no Atmosphere?
I adore this video, but it's really strange that the dialogue needed an editing pass? There are several points where sentences either don't sound right, or actually don't make sense. It clearly has taken an unbelievable amount of time and effort to put this incredible video together, and every other part of it truly shines, which is why the dialogue issues stand out.   I noted a few of them:  7:12 "[...] our sun is 30% less bright than it is today, but there are still so many greenhouse gasses that it is still much hot and comfy" ?  12:44 "These hydrothermal vents we're looking at, and where hot minerals emerge, may have been [...]" 47:41 "Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right?"    anyway, like I said, an otherwise fantastic video, and maybe one of my favourites from this channel <3
59:44 is the funny number
this is probably the single best youtube channel of all time
Diwali special from Kurzgesagt ❤
❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
Kurzgesagt and Bill Wurtz bouta have a stand battle
Love how you'd have to slow it down thousands of times just to see humanity. Really puts into perspective how short the age of man really is.
"Life uhh.. finds a way."  (let's not put the timestamp, people will uhh... find it anyway)
Haven't felt such wonder at experiencing natural history since Carl Sagan guided us through the Cosmic Calendar 43 years ago.
rhyacian era got an absolute banging track
Simply fantastic job, congrats to the team to doing such a big project
Love these passion videos!
Earth lore vs earth gameplay
This was awesome, thank you so much for it. I def would love to see more like this, perhaps cosmological or something.
This might actually be the most impressive video on Youtube. Congrats Kurs Gesagt & the team.
I skip some minute because it was boring billons😂
kimse sizi çevirmiyo artık. zeka yapay kullanın bari.
Religions 😅😅😅😅😅
i watched the whole thing from start to finish
It's terrible to see how all the conspiracy theorists and cult followers (the idiots who believe in the stories of a hundreds of years old fairy tale book) here comment some nonsense out of desperation on a video that must have taken so much time
I wonder where from big rainy clouds appeared in Eoarchean so they created all Earth’s oceans? Before that here was only lava… 🤔
💎M a s t e  r p i e c e 💎
I want to thank the Bangiomorpha pubescence for inventing the seks
Earth is truly magnificent and nope I still can't grasp how long it's been around for 👀
I will sleep well tonight
When bill wurtz did most of it in 19 mins🗿
Wait, what? We got an iron core at the Ectasian? At only 1.4 bil years ago? So no core, no magnetosphere, radiation hitting earth.. just.. hitting it.  Oh, ok, and we had life, albeit only simple cells already.. That is something I did not know! I thought we having the magnetosphere was what allowed life to exist.
what a wonderful work!!!
My favorite channel
Very nice
Our entire civilization, billions and billions of people that exists and that are already gone, all our creations… and we aren’t even a second in this video… yes, that’s our level of insignificance…
Love it! Comment for the Algorithm
All I now want is the same, but from a third eye's view of earth. Perhaps with some zooming in and out to show some kind of "rest of the planet system" state at times.  I know it would not make sense at the scale  of things, but it would help so much understand the cosmic time scale, with plate techtonics, how the rest of the planets cleared their planetary orbits etc...
when Godzilla is born?
at 55:50 you can see my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa chilling on a dune, my man should have stayed underwater
Marvelous video ! Thousands thanks for all your works.
This in a Planetarium woud be pretty cool!
Omg I need the version with only the sound track to enjoy the music with the beautiful background when I am working on pc ❤❤❤❤ insane quality of video 💯💯💯
55:46 NOO PLEASEE SOMEONE STOP HIMMMM!!!!
This guy made a video about skipping some parts of history lol
He didn't tell the story were the indians were all killed up and blacks were enslaved
Amazing!
This'll be the 6th time I've watched this
how long did this take
WHO DID!?
thank you for this video. when you said "we're almost home" i couldnt help but start bawling. haha. this video made me super emotional.
Mesoarchean beat goes hard af 🔥
This is straight up a movie. I'm keeping this in my playlist
“Hi, you’re on a rock floating in space…”
guys, you really have outdone yourselves. what a fucking journey
You guys are the Universe right now, no other words can describe how much i appreciate you!
Love the music 🎶
The floor is lava... you had to say it right?
Once again you done a brilliant job!!! Well done KURZGESAGT!!  I'm a buddhist but i believe science and fact too that's why i love kurzgesagt,,,,It's animation, elaboration and explanation made it easy to understand the theory. <3
1 hour of earth's history, and humankind was gone in the blink of an eye. Impressive showcasing of how long earth was not much more than a ball of rocks, pools and oceans.
incredible !
Damn this soundtrack is a bop
A true trial of attention span. 👍
Should be an obligatory watch in every school. Stunning, absolutely stunning.
Absolutely spectacular watch, honestly one could learn more from your videos compared to sit through modern day classrooms, but to think, most of this planets history was spent mostly growing up while life on this planet is relatively new in comparison, its also funny to think that compare to when life first walked on the continents it almost looks like an alien world compared to now
wooow !!1!!11!!
"Dont blink or you might miss all of human history" phrase gave me chills.
Is this inspired by/in collaboration with the Deep Time Walk?
Cameraman MVP for getting the footage
I didn't see god! Any of them😅😅
If you're wondering how they made THIS in just a few weeks, they probably worked on it while working on other videos.
this is brilliant
best thing to sleep to
THANKS AWESOME
Eating the sun... aaah yes
You guys are the heroes we need. Thank you for your hard work!!
bill wurtz: ooh sweet, awesome
best to relax with a snack, with the rain, and for fall asleep. I love this cinematic animation 100000000%
imagine showing this to a class. I can imagine in the future Gen-z's will be showing Kurzgesagt videos to Gen-alphas during school sessions.
this would be cool to have on wallpaper engine!!!
I didn't even check the whole title i just clicked it because it's from this channel. After watching I didn't realize it was an hour long!!! Wow!!! It was mpressive! ❤
Ahahahaha awesome gp as always
Funny how you represent all this as facts while most of it is still theories. But still a great work 🎉
prove that world is alive for 4.5B years. scientists said this, scientists said that,blah blah..  They are workers under the hands of richer people.
Life uhhh finds a way🤣
I found animation glitch on 7:48 to 7:50. Check if you can see or aware this too xD
Pray for Palestine 🇵🇸
I feel like this animation could be the background scenery for the Platypus game
We Need This in german please !!!
Mad props to the sound design and music team. Their skills really elevate this masterpiece to a whole new era- I mean level!🤩
1 hour looks too long maybe 5 min better?
Sooo coool
This 1 hour timeline was amazing. How about more videos like that but with details about each period?
Where did that first rain came from?
Young earth creationists *in shambles*
This is the greatest thing. Thank you!
Suck on this Flat Earthers! Of course they will. They'll just tell you they don't like the flavor.
This is the genre I didn't know I needed! Long-form animation videos with dope music and little bits of science sprinkled throughout. More please!
WHOAAA they went ALL OUT with this one!!!
Thanks for the video Bill Gates.
Can we have the none Audio and without the Top-Right text version of this video? it would be Fantastic Background video...
39:53 Is he spitting?
Thanks Kurzgesagt loved the video great animation and narrator
Ideal video for droning through those meetings that should have been an email.
Nominate this movie to oscars
Do you have any videos on The Standard Model of particle physics?  or plans for making videos about it?
I really took your soundtrack for granted before this.
this was truly amazing, i didnt miss a single second
I can't believe this video is Free to watch
The Paleoarcheans really knew how to mix
This video is incredible, but, I wish there were small name tags floating over the various rocks and life forms included.
Human:Ey what movie is this   Humn :it's called the evolution of earth in one hour
The music is awesome
Why is this so relaxing to watch 😅
Animation and background music was amazing 🎉
Such an amazing video!! you guys killed it
LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!
THIS IS AMAZING WOW
but how did first rain happen ?
Ladies and gentlemen: Invention of Sex (44:52)
This is absolutely insane. I love your channel but this time, due to sheer quality and dedication of the channel I shall do what every yt channel ask that I never do. Like, share, comment
That is the most beautiful landscapes that ive ever seen. Want to make a game with this backgrounds
id love to see this same exact format but instead looking at the entire solar system, having a visual representation of all of our planets journey as the move throughout the solar system
Love how by time passes the eras become shorter and shorter
i love the music :) you can just vibe to it for an hour haha
설랜다....
Do i hear some influences from Extrawelt? 😍
The soundtrack!!!❤❤❤ that’s my new commute jam
*Cough* history of the entire world i guess *cough*
In another billion years, after human civilizasion perrished some other intelligent Earth Species is gonna make a video like this and they be like: "Damn those monkey creatures evolved quick and got extinct even quicker lol"
man that music in the end when the mammals start to develop in the world i literally got goosebumps
Great video kurzgesagt!!
Why this shit jamming
Towards the end there, the music seems to be a modified version of "The Human Era" - will that specific version be available anywhere to listen to soon?
I wish Youtube has 5x playback speed so I could watch this masterpiece while eating my lunch. Great channel by the way ❤❤
Before "paving the way for more complex life", the Great Oxydation Event was above all a mass extinction event. Could have been mentioned.
You guys are amazing. Every video the animation improves. The narration is alwas top-notch. Kudos Kurzgesagt!
This video is a masterpiece 👌🏿
Where does the rain come from in the Eoarchean? From the asteroids?
All just a theory that cannot be verified.
For every year a view please
I really enjoyed that, but I wish we had a little more detail about the different time periods.  I know that wasn't what this was meant to be, and it would have required a lot more time to complete, but I think they really missed the ticket.
really wanted to know how the earths core was made. never found out it was that simple like lava dissolving
It's wild to imagine how insignificant our timeline is. It goes to show that our lifetime here more valuable than ever.
Set playback speed to 1/31536000000000 to watch it in real time
This masterpiece somehow strengthened my faith as I was in awe of how genius, powerful, and merciful our creator is. Thank you.
yooo whaaa
Dude...we have been here such a small time by the time I looked up from my work. It was over 😂😂😂
Thank you as always
Massive props to Epic Mountain, I could and will listen to it in album form
39:50 The narrator just spat? Wut?!?
It would be good if you have the temperature of what we are seeing as well. Great video nonetheless!
Bill Wurtz would be proud
Amazing, the energy, the effort and the love to make this is truly inspiring🔥
So cool
Jesus what an undertaking to animate this. Respect
now we need a vid of just the music or a spotify upload
At 15%, I already can imagine human civilization is just less than 1 frame of 120fps
a minute in to the hadean period and I'm laughing at how we even care about anything in our tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny human period...I love the universe!
This is the first video of yours I've found boring 😔
Great video! Althoug in this one i would have preffered to not be a narrator, just text in the background for the music to not get interrupted. If you are leaving it behinfd you will be concentrated on work or etc and dont be ready to pay attention to the narrator most of the time
This is nothing but brilliant!
Insane! Thank you!!!
I knew we hadn't been here very long at all, but to only see any noticable sized life till less than 10 minutes from the end was a surprize
So when kids play "the floor is lava", what they really mean is "time travel 4.5 billions of year ago"!
i know a youtube video that does the same thing in about 10 minutes and is animated as well
It's fascinating to me that life gets exponentially more complex over time and that we are not nearly as complicated as species will be in a few 100k years.  Great video - one hour of very good animation, completely for free.
Excellent job!!
Ok ill watch the video gosh!
thanks
Thank you for this amazing video! It blows my mind how there are so many flat earthers echo chambering their beliefs when the science is in front of them
"life, uh, finds a way" I cracked up
So Youtube ads came about around 3650 million years ago. Interesting
This is amazing
Where did all the rain come from? For the first millions years there was no rain and then suddenly it started raining. Was it because it was too hot for the water to condense into rain? This is a lot of water, and I don't think it could have all been hanging out in the sky as water vapour. Then the earth would have been completely covered in clouds.
in this video, your life would be only around 0.00006667 seconds
This video must have took like… forever? 4.5 billion years i guess
oh my god 1 hour of flawless animating this is insane.
Right here, right now!❤
It's a companion video to Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
Requesting to make similar vedio on human history just highlighting technology advance . No king or religion
What proof is there it’s 4.5 billion years old? Oh wait there is none. Cool vid tho. Genesis is there for a more accurate telling of earth’s history.
I have no words truly stronger than thank you.
Pretty nuts when you realize each second represents a million years… we didn’t even reach a billion til near 14 mins into the video.
Amazing, please make more timeline videoed like this! But with a different scale
Its amazing how  the rate at which complexity gets more complex gets faster as we progress. Billions of years of “non life” then billions more to archean life, hundred of millions to unicellular, then Cambrian explosion tens of millions of years to diversity then millions of years mammals, few thousand years intelligence… etc. once intelligence , consciousness arrives we might reach a rate at which its so fast 1 second is an epoch (singularity)
DAMN!
God the progressive rock inspired drum forward soundtracks made me do the catjam gif
i am so thankful for all the hard work that went into this project
It would make a good screensaver for roku..
And uhh. Need a 10min version with less loops n lack of narratives. Roku background worth [shrug]
kurz gesagt deserves 100m subscribers like i know he has 21 m hich is good but my honest opinion is that he needs 100m
I mean..if we are a seeded alien project.. then they are in it for the long haul lmao.  "In 5,000,000,000 generations check on this planet called earth.. we dropped some single cell organisms off their and wanna see how far they've came" 😅
If you want to redeem yourself you NEED to make a video on how the scientific community is blocking any research that could potentially disagree with manmade climate change, and will ignore any data that doesn't go against that narrative. In that field science is dead and there HAVE been whistleblowers. This needs to be acknowledged. Do something about it
Finally something smarter than nuking a nuke on the event horizon of a black hole.. yeah this channel has made some stupid ish
the floor is lava
POV: You're downloading the new dlc in Earth Simulator. Takes 1 hour to install all of the 4.5 billion gigabytes worth of content.
No spoiler warning?
Came for information, stayed for the music ❤  Great way of trying to let People see how evolution happens 😝❤  To be fair, this is one of your best uploads since "the egg" 🙏
this is absolutely incredible!!  amazing work!
The more i study about the universe. The stronger my faith and i get to know that Allah (The God) Almighty endless powerful created all of this.  SubhanAllah Alhamdulillah Allahuakbar.
Did anyone get emotional especially at the end? When the narrator says "It's our time now. We're almost home." Goosebumps. Such an amazing video.
Never thought I would say this, I lost what time I was at inbetween The Hadean Period and the Eoarchean Period.
19:40 I thought "The Only Thing They Fear Is You" was about to drop!
Kurzgesagt just showed that the earth must be flat. The Camera has to be on a straight track for this to work AND you don't even see sphere shape!
Feel like stealing watching this for free
35:15 TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
Oh my god! THE MUSIC! ❤❤❤❤❤
Hi Kurzgesagt. Is it possible to have this video as an app? Kinda like your "Universe in a Nutshell" app in the play and app store.
If my 10 year old me saw this, I would go insane!
I'll go on record saying that this is one of the greatest YouTube videos ever made. A perfect balance of education and serenity. The animation is stellar and huge respect to Epic Mountain for the perfect soundtrack!
SIGMA 🗿
19:19 Doom feeling intensifies
Comme quoi le réchauffement de la planète c'est pas nouveau et que c'est cyclique.
What a bad idea for a video. A video that invites you not to watch it.
Life uhh.. uhh finds a way
Uhm, the video is truly great, could you please upload a version without the narration so that I can better play it while working? Thank you very much!
I just want to thank all the wonderful people who designed this video and bro, I have to say, the music and the animations are GODLY!👍👏
❤️‍🔥
Wow, more than half of kurzgesagt team has german names. ❤
Very nice video, what an idea. :)
The bad grammar reveals that this is just an AI script. The whole thing's just an AI question and answer, I suppose.
Dang it! I blinked and missed the Nagasaki and Hiroshima Nuke
Anyone else crack a laugh when he said the floor is lava? No, just me? Okay just swiftly moving on.
F*cking amazing!!!
Genuinely thank you for your efforts. Your hard work is commendable! LOVE the animation, the music, the narration ALL of it! Such a vibe, this is low key my focus playlist at work haha. 🎉❤ Thank you for THIS.
45:00 the beginning of all of our modern problems
Wonderful video. Thank you for making it.
what a vid
this has thrown me into existential crisis
Amazing work ! Thanks for this beautiful Animation !
What a journey! What an effort! Kudos and Congratulations ❤ Keep it up🤘
This is an amazingggg video loved everything
Rubbish...pure unadulterated surmise and conjecture.
Fortunately, I was able to skip the ad that lasted 150M years.
That gaze of the only human in video... It somehow fill one's determination
So how does water suddenly appear in our atmosphere? That was the first part I was most interested in
Too long and boring... Your audience retention graphs would've been terrible on this one
very nice video, is there a version without music? only background effects and narration voice. I find the music too loud compared to the narrator voice
A true masterpiece
This is simply the best educational movie ever.  You just added 2 to maybe 4 hours of teachings for my students this year. Those moments of silence are pure gold to question, digest the last mindblown fact, or trying to figure out what's next. Masterpiece that should be shown in every school in the world.  Thanks!!
The video's content was intriguing, but I couldn't help but notice that some animations were repeated, making it longer than necessary. Additionally, there seemed to be a substantial amount of information presented as theories. It's worth considering a more streamlined approach to keep the video engaging and focused. While the concept of life evolving rapidly in 200 million years is fascinating, it might be beneficial to delve deeper into the scientific evidence supporting such claims, as the comparison to the broader timeline of 4 billion years raises questions about the logical consistency of the narrative.
The music is going unnecessarily hard in the Mesoarchean
nerd
Creationists:  "4.5 billion?  Nuh-uh!  Every one of the physical sciences is wrong!"
Yes! now i must, Kurzgesagt videos have encouraged me to create my own space documentary (i love space)
This is GREAT! Thank you!
"Don't blink or you might miss the entirety of human history"
I braced for late heavy bombardment but none followed :/ Sleek transitions tho
Thank you for all your effort and hard work! Love your Content ^^
impressive
this team deserves every bit of praise for making this video
Humans are fish... I just made it to the Carboniferous, and because I'm high, I can't unhyptonize myself from this entrancing video- I'm awe struck
Hope you will do "From now to the Universe's ending".

how earth 4.5 billions years.? what's the basis? how they come up 4.5b? how they know we are the 1st?
One of the best videos on the internet recently. Amazing animation and the music is great.

theres no way that nothing in this video is looped, right?
Pfffft !! impossible for YOUR brain to grasp
I wonder how much extra mass the earth gained from all the asteroid impacts over so many years, borh by water and rock.
Would be awesome to have this as a wallpaper with wallpaper engine!! What a cool video!
What an experience. I would really like to imagine that for the music they just jammed an hour straight
The Hadean stuff is mostly incorrect. There are data for liquid water oceans by 4.4 b.y. ago. No late heavy bombardment, etc. Please update.
50 mins in. I don't want to look away in case I miss the part where stuff starts happening.
incorrect imo
I'm probably in a small minority here but I found the constant one directional scrolling disorientating. I'm sure most fold wouldn't even notice, but I would be more at ease with the direction changing once in a while. Love the content, made it about half way but couldn't continue.
Interesting. In the origin of oceans part, it is just said, it rained for millions of years. But it didnt dedicate enough time to cover the sky and clouds formation around that time period. We learn rain is the mechanism via water is recycled back into our environment(the water cycle). But in the beginning, Earth had hardly any water , only lava. How such enormous volume of water got condensed and rained always baffles me. From what i can find, the water is from other external sources, not of Earth origin. This explains how life is seeded on Earth, as your previous video beautifully illustrated. But it is very hard to imagine, what is the reservoir up there in the atmosphere, that poured non-stop for millions of years.   And another thing that still eludes my understanding is, how the continents emerged from the depths of the ocean and rose above the mean sea level. Does the earth crust colliding and subducting against each other pushed a huge chunk above the sea level?
Just so freakin cool.  The music rocked, too--thanks for making this!
Tonian sounds like a Tool album
Could we have version with voiceover ? just so i can put it in loop while i work ?  Amazing work, loved it <3
This video is kind of tini tiny gift for humanity
Hands down, the best thing i've seen on youtube.
This is truly a masterpiece
credits to the animation team for not seeing their family, you a trooper 😭
"Hope you felt something watching this"  God damn it I cried
wow
After all this Prove   still Kurzgesagt channel doesn’t believe in God the creator the powerful the knowledgeable
“Still much hot and comfy” ??????? 7:24
Sleep playlist for sure.
The way music changes in each era😩❤️
immaculate
Keep going brother❤
I deserve to watch this video
That we are able to look back how our earth looked before we even EXISTED is magnificent. You guys made this video in 4 years, that gotta earn respect! Y’all really made me more interested in science and other stuff!  You all are truly amazing! Great job! [ I watched it all in one sitting 🙃]
1 hour is actually crazy
39:54 did the narrator just spit or am i tripping ?
I cant express enough how much I love your videos! Thank you for being here. I absolutely love your narration, especially in your "The Egg" video, your voice is so comforting. This was such a wonderful video, and I love the animation style! I watch every ad as well to help support your channel & always recommend it to my friends & likeminded folks. Again, thank you for your awesome & educational videos! - A Loyal Fan, cheers! 🎉😄
Please do a 24 hour version
this seriously unserious welldone
is this a dream
People this is so fun and cool and interesting what a great idea you had ... GJ !
and the floor is lava
This for free?, this is amazing
45:03 haha he said sex so funnyyyyy
i am sorry kurzgesagt but you cant better "the entire history of the world, i guess". but nice try and nice animations and an amazing video nonetheless.
The Cretaceous era was a vibe! From the visuals to the orchestral music and vocals, so good!
Shoutout the the Stenian age for the invention
I like the music
9:00 can someone explain me where's the rain coming from?? It was all lava and it starts raining for millions of years like how?? Where all the water coming from
I love this
We need a kurzgesagt lofi video
Based on a true story…
so many names for earth's eras I've never heard before, this is so cool and impressive, I love everything this team does!!!!
A truly monumental creation. Among the most fascinating videos on Youtube. A big thank you and congratulations to everyone in the team. Hats off for creating a timeless masterpiece.👏👏
Hat's off 💯
this is stunning ✨🌏
I blinked for the human history part, now I have to replay the video
Rhat was just mazing
Claim your "I watched the full video ticket here" 👇
Less than a minute in, Theia colliding with earth presented as fact when it's only a hypothesis.
only a word: B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L.😍
History of the entire world I guess but on steroids
Amazing vid as usual!
Your best video ever.
다음에 무슨 일이 일어날지 궁금해서 알 고 있지만 그 순간을 마주하는게 기대되어서
Thank you for the longest existential crisis video... I did not blink and yet still completely missed all of human history. We are less than a speck 😌
TLDR: you are looking at a long loop timelapses countdown over an hour. No thanks
hooooly
Earth and life itself are truly the Masterpiece of Creation
Congratulations guys and thank you for your hard work over the years.
Exceptional!
You guys are anazing. This was beautiful.
Wow this is truly amazing! The soundtrack and animation is a work of art! Thank you guys!
this is another level! thanks for this guys 🤟
umm excuse me the music doesn't have the right to be this fire
I want to live forever
Just crazy and really good, shows that the timespan in which humans existed is very very short compared to Earth's! And It's free!
This is truly incredible. Such a great watch, and clearly so much hard work has gone into it as always! Thanks :)
If you ever feel betrayed just remember that Kurzgesagt didn't show the meteor crash in the Orosirian Period.
Can you make a narration free version
Thank you ❤
The music slaps!!
I am speechless, great job!
Boring
Love this! Keep up the great work!
Perfection at its finest.
Amazing. No other words. Thank you!
Your best work yet. Thank you!!!
37:07 what the hell did you just say
This is Youtube Masterpiece 🙏❣️
⭐️⭐️⭐️
Two things. One, I'm really glad the video didn't give any special treatment to homo sapien by changing the time scaling for 'us'. Two, I waited like 3.5 billion years for a shout out to the first flowering plant and it never came 😂. I will always remember learning how new flowers are, I'm so very glad to exist at the same time as flowers! Peace out.
All this buildup, just to get rejected by your crush
We don't deserve Kuzgesagt, this is too good.
popped a gummy immediately and enjoying the ride. this is gonna be great, I just know.
THE FLOOR IS LAVA! 🔥
Amazing
earth lore goes crazy
Can anyone pls let me abt the quality of their posters. Looking to buy one for my friend.
Such a great video and hell of an idea. I’m even ashamed of myself for being not patient enough to sit this thru😂
Awesomeee
Me: Avoiding spoiler on time stamp to get know whole earth story arc
Amazing work overall! Reminds me of History of the World I guess by Bill Wurtz, but this is a more relaxed and factual version compared
Thats great. For that i will buy a big screen, place it in living room und run it permanently like in a museum
44:52 sex update finally dropped
ill come back when theres time stamps.
Why no sun (sunrise/set/any motion) in the hadean phase?
You ate this up.
This is something I didn't know I needed
I want this video in Hindi, for my parents to see!
This is absolutely genius! Beautiful and meditative. Hip-hop beats to chill and work has a huge competition :) I love your channel so much! Thank you for everything you do, please never stop ❤
I slept @ 26:47
Would love this as an animated background for my pc.
Really its good to see such quality content for free You guys are amazing, keep it up
Daaaaaamn, Who let the bro cook ...
I ordered a pizza just to watch this video. Thank you for this amazing content.
Ngl hadean is kinda a mood
Can we start getting the intro back ?
The only thing bad about this is youtube's unskippable ads back to back. Why even watch the video? Just watch the ads at this point.
this made me wanna play spore
And what about God?
This is a masterpiece ☝️🔥
Allah SWT made all of this. Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim
watching this in the year 2023.
Truly superb work!
I love videos or tools like this that help demonstrate the scale of different stuff. Scales we just cannot fully wrap our heads around.
Wow this is a movie ! 😂🎉
I love the Orosirian soundtrack
Now I'm trying to imagine what fungi having sex loons like
I think this is by far your best video yet. Really helps the average person understand cosmic concepts. Well done!!!
I got up and went to be bathroom and a few million years passed. I mean nothing.
This was really good, but I played it in x2 speed. Come to think of it, you should have had a side counter viewing the progress of organisms, it might have involved more depth
My next live wallpaper
Excellent content 👍😊
it makes sense that the eras shrink as time carries forward-we know more about earth's history the closer to our time it approached.
Now for the depressing part.. how many minutes of the video are left until photosynthesis becomes impossible?
Blud meant it quite literally when he said "Don't blink or you might have miss all of our human history"
Kurzgesagt is really good at making you feel a lot of big emotions about science stuff that is othwrwise often hard to relate to.
So when do stands get introduced?
If you could understand how every current flowed, could you understand how every being thought?
this video gives me a bit of existentialism is but is relaxing at the same timr
This is simply genius
This film is beautiful as the life is ❤
What an incredible achievement. Thank you for all the hard work, Kurzgesagt.
What a finely tuned place for life, even the earth needed some time to get it together
Are your posters single paged?
masterpiece ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
honestly if all of youtube was like this, I'd probably never get any work done! This is so, so good!!
Thank you for your amazing work I love all your videos
This video will have many rewatches from me!
I totally needed this!!!! Thank you!!! ❤
No wonder it took weeks for this vid. Good job guys
bur when do the transformers arrive?
I genuinely am curious on how long it took to animate this
This is a particular stupid way to portray the passage of time. There  should be a special place in hell for animators like you, guys, who just steal viewers precious time.
Bro took terrarias whole flow!
where is hallucigenia in Cambrian period? I want my First Titan.
I just start and i now its gonna be amazing, thanks
Not to take away from the amazing artwork/animation/direction/narration, but  I'd play this just for the music. This is the one of the best piece of art I've encounter this year
Masterpiece
Bro, keep going.
28:12 sounds like a theme from terraria  The music in this video is god tier
Can we please get this on wallpaper engine
evolution has just as much proof to it that creation has
Kurzgesagt: The Movie
This was amazing. Props to the whole team. Speacial shout-out for all the music. I never felt bored for a second with those sweet ambient groves rolling.
Awesome creation
To think Humans rose up from cavemen to bronze then medieval then industrial then two world wars then visiting the moon & then to today, all within a second of earths history- everything & everyone you have ever known or read about born and died in that fraction of second.
Alternate video title: Immortality, the long way round
Wow, similar concept to bill wurtz history of the entire world I guess, except in this the time is at a fixed rate so the human history isn’t even covered because it all happened in like 12 thousand years (well idk yet I haven’t watched the end) maybe he slows down at points
W cameraman for living 4.5 billion years 🤯
"The history of Earth, I guess" but on steroids and beautifully animated. Well done, Kurzgesagt
just watched an hour long music video
❤❤❤ great absolutely love it thanks 😊
Im sorry I love these videos so much but this just left me with more questions like whare did the largest astrod hit? I know the one that took out the dinosaurs is around Mexico but what's this about the largest astrod?
Well done
You and your team are doing a great great job! Amazing content man.
Since the term 'year' is an abstract concept that refers to 'one full orbit.' So, the earth has been rotating the sun for more than 4.5 billion times.
Im loving that DOOM rift at 19:45!!
Awesome!!
45:00 well, aren't they gonna release Sex 2?? We've been waiting for over a billion years now
I've been saving this to watch on my birthday, and i have to say, it exceeded every expectation. Thank you team, you're all so amazing and the work you do is so important! 💚
Wow this gives me hope for the internet
Watched the entire thing without skipping. Kudos for getting this done before AI gets to it.  :)
Do they give out awards for best video of the year? If so everyone else who won it before needs to throw out their trophies because this surpasses them all. 🏆
Well constructed as usual.  A wonder to the senses.  When art and science interact.  Nice!
Cool! But at the end the 200,000 years (all humans history) should have been just 0.16 seconds, it seems the human was on the screen way too long.  How about a similar 1 hour video of the last 200,000 years (ie humans) would be equally eye opening. It might seem like 55 years per second is too much resolution, but consider over that hour getting to 12000 years ago (ie first civilization) is just 3.5 minutes before the end, pyramids 90 seconds, Biblical times 36 seconds before the end, and as to modern industrialized times that's just 5 seconds before the end of a full hour video.
Playing this instead of a yule log this year.
My one wish is to be able to watch this in real life
Wow, what a fabulous video.  Some other creator might not be willing to make a one hour video, never mind one that lacks dialogue for large stretches of time, but, Kurzgesagt, I'm so glad you had the courage and the vision to do this.  I absolutely loved it.  What a great concept, the entire history of the Earth shown in one hour, with a time clock in the corner counting along through the various periods of time. It's fantastic.  And as much as I love your narrator and your writing (and I do), I really enjoy the large stretches of the video where all we hear is the music.  Coupled with the visuals, it makes it all very relaxing and serene.  Personally, it really helped me to imagine all of these various environments, marveling at it all.  It really gave my imagination time and space to take it all in.  I really, really enjoyed it.  I think it's excellent.  Well done.  Really, I tip my cap to the people at Kurzgesagt for putting this together. 👍 (And I'm going to wear my Kurz socks tomorrow, for sure.)
God
Wow
This is aamzinf
This is so fucking cool
我还奇怪为什么这么久没更，攒大招呢😮
I never knew life was around for so long before the Cambrian era... that's insane how long it took for early life to complexify like that.
It's crazy to think that this entire video is an hour long, and humans fit into barely longer than a tenth of a second in it.
The fact that eukaryotic life evolved before the inner core formed seems illegal somehow.
Take my comment. The team who made this deserves the world.
.
Ectasian song is my favorite! They are all so beautifully done, but that one hits different!
Music gets down lol
Ah yes, perfect timing. The edible just kicked in 😂
wonderful
Suddenly, the fact that my workday feels like I'm waiting for the last neutrons in the universe to decay before I can go home, makes sense when you scale it out to 4.5b years/hour.
😍
OMG i will watch this after my exams
All so we can take selfies with our lips all pouty as we pose.....so worth it.
WOW.
Loveeed the animation, it's flawless
very impressive props to animators :)
I wenf to the bathroom and suddenly life appeared 😡😡
At some point in minute 30, I realized that the history of hominids won't last more than 1 second
Damn
Amazing video, it is epic! Well done❤
U guys should win an Oscar
my inner kid was so happy, and I as an adult was so happy this was very enjoyable and one of the best informative videos. thank you guys.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best content on internet right now. Truly amazing.
Thanks so much. That was amazing
Subscribe for part 2! (Eventually)
This video is not exactly what I was expecting. Would it be asking too much to expect a something different every second for the entire hour of animation?
Fantastic video! This is the best visualization of deep time I have ever seen.
i think you accidentally made a club banger. Love it.
The Hadean Era had a beat that SLAPPED.
damn when watching this an your taking bong rips things just idk fade together its nice an relaxing good stuff an it helps you learn so double awesome
This was incredible!!! The music was all just bops and the animation was immaculate as always. Love love love!
Bill wurtz did it better
shout out to bangiomorpha pubescens, love what you do
loved it, was cooking meanwhile, it was perfect :)
What Song Is That?
The juxtaposition of the vastness of Earth's history and the brevity of human existence within a one-second timeframe can evoke a profound emotional response, I don't get why even though I knew it would be short I was shocked afterwards
I'm gonna make this my pc wallpaper.
Insane content quality! Thank you this is why Youtube rules
Saludo
Everyone's talking about the hours worth of animation, but I just appreciate the hour of what is absolutely Simon Viklund build phase.
sex is invented at 44:59
where is mustache man
Great job
can't sleep today, this was the longest evening by far. Never thought that I'll be here for 4.5 billion years. lol
"the floor is lava" run
This is my 5th time coming back to this video because I keep falling asleep watching it
NO MUSIC
NO MUSIC
This video is too fast. Can you make it again, but in real time?
NO MUSIC
NO MUSIC
NO MUSIC
Was an amazing experience, so so great. Thank you so much, was a beautiful journey. Really, thank you.
Wow this is wonderful! 😍😍❤
That was quite the journey
should put a pop up window with the soundtrack info for each section. Some real bangers in there.
I'm comment in Portuguese, don't care: PUTA QUE PARIU! QUE VÍDEO FODA!
This is amazing. Please do a making of BTS video
The Sun is a deadly laser
It reminds me of that one spongebob episode where is just him dancing for 20 mins
Mad props to the editor that spent the last 4.5 billion years making this masterpiece
With 4.5 billion years of earth‘s history in one hour, humans emerge merely 4 milliseconds before the end. Incredible.
I've been sitting here for like 1.5 billion years, eating cheetos, just waiting for the DOOM music to kick in.
my friend when he says ''Be right Back'': 00:08
So good...So Concise....So Precise...So Priceless😮❤🎉
This is gonna be the best 1 hour I've ever wasted...
Allegedly
At first I was like, "wait is there a second video with the rest where humans come online?", then I realized, we've only been around for that long.
It's like watching paint dry. But paint does indeed dry, eventually.
It was okay
Amazing! I would love to see one of these showing things in space for an hour with gorgeous music! I would love to have something playing in the background flying through space and through nebulas and such!
Video is 1:03:30, unwatchable absolute lies from the Kurzgesagt team; unsubscribed.  /s great video love the chickens!
31:37
Hardest bass rift through the mesoarchean era
This is amazing, huge thanks to the animation team that took the time to make this masterpiece, really hope this video gets all the recognition it deserves and then some
3 seconds is all it took for that one species  to escape earth
🤡🤡🤡
41:39 THE OCEAN'S WHAT??
This is the most amazing wonderful beautiful piece of art&science that I have seen. This remains me my first steps discovering the world through albums and books and now is alive :)
giving your heart to Jesus is the best decision that can ever be made. i can assure and promise you that if anything 🧡
Hi
Who was in the Studio 👌🏾😩🎶  *waits through the credits* oh ok :p
❤
Whoever did the score for this definitely listens to goa/psytrance.... Track at 25 min is a stomper
Was there a night during hadean period, and if so, would there be any igneous formations that would form and melt again in the additional morning heat, or was the whole spinny spinny day n night dance not a thing yet?
Sounds like TOOL joined the party in the Ectasian age and stuck around for a couple more. Awesome music!
Each second of this video was 31.5 Trillion seconds in reality
I know this is more of an experimental video and its very cool and all, but since animation is so expensive and it would be insane to make something less repetitive stretch out for a whole hour, then couldnt they have added some more narration? There is SO MUCH to talk about in each of those periods, feels like all that boring silence with bits of trivia in between for most of the runtime is kind of a waste of a great video idea idk
Seen none of it in the bible
getting dissapointed for ther first time. It was super boring. Sorry to say this
There seems to be a rendering glitch at 29:43?
If this video had come out before the names were decided, I can see everyone calling the different periods after the music styles or prominent instruments.  Like "back in the techno age, bombardment by asteroids tapered off, or, ocean acidification started to get worse when the snare drum came in."
This is sooooooooooooo good!
This is amazing. Absolutely crushed it with the music.
Great music!
i used to watch Kurgesagt when I was younger and nothing has changed, WOW
I think I’m in the lava hell phase of my life still 😂
Dig the music
oh this is fantastic.
Wait, if there was no oxigen in the atmosphere in the mesoarchean, how did it rain in the eoarchean if water is made of oxigen and hidrogen?
Life on our Planet, except animated and in 1 hour. Nice!
Someone please bring back the Mesoarchean microbes they were cooking something with that guitar
ppl who have seen this when it had 70k likes 👇
Excellent Ambience
Hats off to your research and animation !
❤beautiful
미쳤다 ㄷㄷ
I subscribe this channel when 400k and now its 21 million. Wow😮nice video this is Awesome
I've been subbed for years, love all your content, this is absolutely amazing!
Pure. Perfection. I cried!
Best video this channel has ever made among all the amazing content you guys have created🎉
Thank you, @Kurzgesagt! ❤
meditating humbling and amazing  thanks for your experiment!
propaganda
I love you guys so much.
Whoever was on the drums for that long stretch was great. Sounded like they had Mike Portnoy in the studio 💯
Ehhhh You get the gyzt of it 🤷‍♂️
all these millions of years and we're still waiting for sex 2 open beta to come out :c
2019? Dang.
Encoding bug on 29:42-29:45, visible on all resolutions
How come sex has been around for one billion years if I never had it
Watching THIS ON SHROOMS! MY GAWD! Such a blessing to be breathing RN!!! We all must pledge our allegiance to transcendence of our species and the preservation of our collective conscioousnesssss!!! EGOCENTRISM IS WHAT COULD DESTROY ALL OF THIS! CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETTTY AND TO OUR GLOBAL CIVILIZATION WE MUST!
The US is like a trillion dollar in debt right? And the earth is a billion year old, right? So that means that the the USA as a country is more in debt than the age of the earth     WHAAAT
Soundtrack on this is unreal, best tecno set ive heard randomly in a video
Amazing! Thank you! 👏🏻
this is so great
This is so cool! But why does it say “million year ago” at the top in the count down, when you are saying “Billion years ago”?
the history of entire world i guess (animated)
Thank You All Very Much!! 🥰 "What a Long, Strange Trip it's been!" 😁 Mike in San Diego. 🌞🎸🚀🖖
Best prod rock album this century.
Interesting....🤔
The fact that the cameraman is 4.5 billion years old
Algae bangiormorpha pubescens inventing sex around 1.2 billion years ago and yet here i am
It took be a few days to watch this but I loved this so much. I’ll probably play it more too
Getting alot of Tool vibes from the music 👌
Only True Fans can like this comment.
That was beautufl, thank you so much for putting this together, very moving stuff.
3:47 why did the music just randomly go hard?
You have given my an additional 20 seconds of attention span with this hour long video, glorious stuff
_"Last Summer: I got to first base with Elka Doom.  Signed, Nils Lutefisk"_
Thanks for the existential crisis
Absolutely amazing, the amount of work and detail (including the work for the soundtrack). Thank you for this experience!
incredible video
Earth is 4.5 billion years old  Says who? Based upon what?
You're sponsored by Bill Gates. No one should take anything you say as fact or good for them.
The soundtrack was incredible, the whole thing was mesmerising!
I cant believe we get to consume this type of content for free. Thank you so much Kurzgesagt!!
the fact they had a train running 4.5 billion years ago is crazy
This is single handedly one of my favorite things their entire crew have ever made...  😢❤❤❤
Mesoarchean era makes me want to rip and tear until it is done.
man I got an ad on the thunder lol
Incredibly proud of you
Why is this 1 hour long video only 5 minutes long ?
My nine-year-old daughter Savannah says, and I agree with her completely, that this is one of the coolest videos ever. She also says, and I agree with her, even more completely, that this would be a very cool VR experience where you could walk around in the world that you’re showing in the video. Also, we love the music.
That's a piece of art
Don't leave God out guys. Have a blessed day!
👏👏👏
I love your Videos I also get some merch and posters to Support you. Love from🇦🇹
This could be seen as the 4th episode of the Qatsi movies. Kurzgesagtqatsi. "Life with enchantment". Thank you for existing, evolving and surviving.
saving this for my next mushroom trip.
whoa....10 years in a nutshell.... congratz!  best educational content in the whole world wide web.
❤ god damn well done team. As much as the world is struggling we are are also producing so much art. Beauty   will save the human soul l.
am i the only one who thinks this is one of their least effort videos lately despite being 1 hour long? it is just a few animations looped over and over, not that it isn’t impressive, just not as much as their other videos in my opinion. Even the lake in the Orosirian period just loops over and over every few seconds
Big up to the Bangiomorpha algea
the world is flat, no big bang.!
Brilliant video! Thank you very much for your work and effort
"In a hot second".... geologically speaking. LOL
great job making me feel insignificant! lol
How do you know the sky was orange between 1'425'000'000 years ago and 1'015'000'000 years ago? 🤔
im sure the view retention is horrible but great video.
Fantastic!
I think you should compress both the Bible and the Quran into 1 hour videos as well, just to keep the Creationists happy. Let's face it, they would have a bit more action than this one...especially in the first 50 minutes! 👍😀👍
Glad I got my mushies
oh heck yes more of this long form content please!
Thank you so much for this epic video. Great toolish music in the Tonian!
Sorry I got bored while waiting for some content. If I need a good screensaver, I'll come back, or if you do a shorter version where we're not just looking at lava and there's more dialogue
watching one piece feel like sometimes
Truly insane
Holy shit i got a ad the started with a fade in from white at the beginning of the Eoarchean transition
incredible video
And thats why I love Kurzgesagt <3
Nah they must have brought out the sweat shop kids for this one gaahhh ddaayymmm
Guys ... I've found a way to make it last longer! If you just slow it down so that every second is 1.5 million years, it'll go on for a little while!
It's incredible if you think about it... Notice the exponential growth in the complexity of life over time. How fortunate are we to be alive at a moment in Earth's history when that exponential growth of complex life translates into technology and our understanding of the universe? We are the result of billions of years of effort and survival, and trillions of lives fought and died, to exist in this physical form and state of love, happiness, and intelligence - the capacities of which are also on an exponential curve. I'm not religious but I love to speculate that we are the embodied consciousness of the universe waking up. We owe so much to our ancestors, even down to those single-celled organisms 3 billion years ago. This idea of an exponential rise of complexity and consciousness is more profound to me than any made-up theology.
Bill Wurtz shaking crying rn
Blud thinks the world is millions of years old 😂
Excelente.
cant wait to see 10 billion years in 2 hours ❤❤❤❤
Kurzgesagt: Put this on the backgroud Also Kurzgesagt: *puts insane visuals, epic music, and amazing nareation in video*
OMG thank you Kurzgesagt for this beauty
Me and the boys in the Stenian era waiting for sex to be invented
Amazing!
all bs lies
If i was an immortal being i would probably spend my eons observing planets being formed like this.
This is one of the truly amzing videos and 1 Hour of creating?! dude that would take years of creating but the video is right here! right now! this man derseves 10000000000 billion subs.
Kurzgesagt deserves all the praise it's getting. Love this.
OMG I LOVE THIS CHANNEL!!!
All of a sudden earth doesn’t feel that old.
AN HOUR?????? EXCUSE ME ?
Horseshoe crab gang rise up
that was amazing guys
If they were going to send another disc out for alien species to intercept, they should include this video 😅
45:00 thanks for inventing something for our daily needs.
I haven't watched this yet, but I can tell how much effort, time and love has been spent in the making of this video. Huge thanks, Kurzgesagt <3
you are amazing. everything is perfect: the sound effects, the narration, the animation. im in love with this video. ill definitely come back to this a thousand more times (just like i have to many of your other videos)
love it
what about the polarian and hyperbolean epochs?
A masterpiece
Why does the mesoarchean song sound like the doom theme😂
A work of beauty
The best thing I've watched on YouTube yet! Thank you.
So simple, and it lets you just think the whole time. Then it becomes profound what you come up with in your own head. Then yea…. Yea.
This is a masterpiece. Absolutely incredible.
Beautifully done, and I learned so much from this, as I do all your videos.   I was expecting normal Kurzgesagt videos, but not this. I hope every one of you is proud of this.  This is truly awe-inspiring work, and the music is astounding.
Incredible
The music is really good! I hear some Mick Gordon influences at 19:48 even gettin some doublebass going, very cool. Overall very cool synth work!
One of the best videos I've seen this year !
amazing 🤩
Mesoarchean sound track had me jumpin
I am fucking jamming to this music
53:33 If you were to travel back in time, this is around the time when oxygen levels in the atmosphere would allow you to breathe and survive somehow. If you can find food that is... The fact that earth was absolutely inhabitable for primates 7min to midnight is insane. Almost as insane as the Kurzgesagt Crew <3
I'd buy an album with this soundtrack in a heartbeat. Absolutely amazing.
You guys just made a masterpiece. It's innovative, educational, entertaining AF, and healthy in a world full of crappy short content. keep it legendary.
I can't believe they got Tool to do the soundtrack
Such a bold idea to go through with
history of the entire world, i guess
standing ovation
i was vibin to the music idk what all you lads were here for
1 hour of Earths history...and multicellular life only take up 7 minutes of it. That is frankly wild to me
I sincerely have no words for this. Amazing!!! 🤩
It's crazy that YouTube channels are starting to make movies! Especially good ones!
This is so crazy. I was just searching your channel for a video like this a few days ago
Kurzgesagt must have put a lot of work into of this 100000000000000/10
It so interesting that 75% of earth history we know is plain landscape
The greatest youtube channel of all times
The music in this video is sooo good!
Mesoarchean era goes so hard Orosirian era slaps too
Watching this through was an experience i'm glad i undertook.  Well done to everyone who worked on this!
Am Anfang wie die BR space night aber besser. Insgesamt faszinierend. Vielen Dank für eure Arbeit. Ich hoffe ihr bekommt einen Ehrenplatz, wenigstens in der Menschheitsgeschichte.
imagen this on wall paper engien
Sorry I sneezed and missed all human history.
Am i the only one going through an existential, crisis because of this now?
How long did this take to animate yall sre amazing man 😭😭😭
This belongs in a museum  Like, literally
Give us one with music to make you sleep.
I love this so so much
Mind blowing that at this scale humans have been around for a fraction of a second
Me trying my best not to skip so I can get the full effect of scale of time lol
Genesis 1:1 is better 😂
this is an incredible 4 year project.
Just astonishing
This would be sick on the wallpaper engine
If yall sold a picture frame of just this on loop I would literally buy your entire stock
Hi
My son and I were disappointed in this video. I don't know why it took you so long to make it, but you should have taken longer. You barely showed any creatures. Just repeated scene scrolling. Which may be fine for pre-cambrian, but then what? Like five creatures shown between then and the end of the Divonian? My 5 year old kid was sorely vexed at your lack of prototaxites and wooly mammoths .
props to the asteroids for falling for millions of years
I'm glad and happy I was alive when this art piece came out. Love South America 🤩
Seeing history of earth with linear time scale was indeed fascinating.
This music slaps.
Thank you ❤
this is the coolest video on youtube
@42:00 This a Tool album
That was so lovely
the actual history of the world i guess
life is good
Kurzgesagt, we don't deserve you but we need you. Thank you.
To think god did this in only 6 days to him and we can watch it in 1 hour 😊
To be honest, you missed an opportunity during "all of human history" to put an actual flash of every Kurzgesagt video superimposed and cropped. I suppose that it would actually be below a single frame, but it just seems that section is a bit bare, and yet represents everything we ever were and will be.
I feel insignificant. In a good way. But also Humanity can do so much harm in a short time... it's sad... well anyway thank you this was informative and amazingly animted
Wow how cool this video was. Props to all who contributed in the making of this art piece.
doesn't matter if you believe in this stuff or not, videos like these are so cool and science is awesome. You don't have to believe most of this actually happened for it to not still be fascinating. Great job as always Kurzgesagt team.
Oops I blinked
Respect to the camra man for recording this.
Just fantastic, thank you for making this.
loved every second (million years) was beautifully done!
Why did the music choreographer go so hard during the mesoarchean era 😭
I didnt like the idea of watching a loop animation for 15min with only a number changing
I feel like there should be a way to subscribe twice, because every time I watch a Kurzgesagt video I think "this channel is awesome, I should definitely subscribe" and then I find out that I'm already subscribed
Wicked
Fantastic work team ❤🎉
this as an animated backround wouldbe sick
Amazing thanks for this great video
Asteroids: the cosmic party crashers. Dinosaurs were just getting comfortable, and then BAMMM! Nature's way of reminding us it's not all sunshine and rainbows – sometimes it's a killer asteroid.
Props to the cameraman!
I love this channel ❤
can you upload a version of this with the commentary removed? the imagery and music alone are super chill and perfect for background noise
Might be the longest a creator has focused on the Hadean eon. For this I thank you.
We straight up don't deserve this
Right here! Right now!
yes
The production and execution of this video is unbelievably creative. Thank you for making this video.
👏👏👏 whistle 👏👏👏
This vs Bill Wurtz
1:37 ... "and the floor is lava" 😂
Can’t help noticing you say billion and in the upper right is written million. It’s a big difference. Which one is it?
OMG, IM SO GRATEFUL!! Thank U so MUUUCH!!! IM IN LOOOVE❤😊❤😊❤
8:20 huh did life really come from elsewhere? In 100MIL especially given the conditions sounds insane. I really hope that's the case I really hope we aren't alone.
27:03
7:23 comfy
- Earth is 4.5 billion years old - Every second, 1.5 million years pass - The Hadean eon was the first eon of Earth's history, characterized by lava and a mostly CO2 atmosphere - The moon was formed after a collision with a Mars-sized object called Theia - Life began to emerge a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything - The Great Oxidation Event paved the way for more complex life by introducing oxygen to the atmosphere - A natural, self-sustaining nuclear reactor formed 1.8 billion years ago - Around 1.6 billion years ago, the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merged from two other cells
Amazing work guys!!
0:10 oh man I'm getting the Vsauce vibes already I miss that man
fun fact: you can download this video and use a wallpaper engine to set it as your screen saver
This is one of the most incredible videos ever! <3
This was amazing. As someone who has been struggling recently with world events and whatnot this put things into perspective. Thank you ❤
I need to watch this on ketamine
really first 8 minutes planet getting smashes couldnt of shortened that
The music in Eoarchean was so awesome, I was born in the wrong aeon!
What on earth 🔥🔥🔥🔥
masterpiece!
I hope you guys never cease to amaze, keep up the good work
آقا، با همچیزش موافقم خب ، ولی چرا اونجا که دایناسورها منقرض شدن و یه شهاب سنگ میخوره رو به نمایش نداد. ‏‪1:00:30‬‏
why am I so late😢 i turn on notification to all but i was busy all that time i didn’t see this sooner when i was having difficulties day before yesterday
Idk why but this is better than lofi
This is fantastic! Love the music, the sights, the experience!
Everything about this videos is amazing!!!
Maybe in the big picture, mankind will just be another "whats that?" in the timeline.
Mad respect for the animators of Kurgesagt for doing this  It may have taken years for them to do that  And let us watch it for free  Thank you Kurgesagt for inspiring us that learning is not necessarily have to be black or white but grey   I mean that it shouldn't just be teaching us but how we learn is the real teaching
14:37 bookmark
can you please upload a version with more environmental sound effects and music but without commentary?
might as well make a Kurzgesagt side scroll game at this point
Mesoarchean music slaps
amazing
I may use this in the future to calibrate my time machine.
34:00 why did you mention the asteroid but didnt display it?
I loved all the faces that you put on the first formed rocks
Incredible!!!
kurzgesagt is not made for youtube youtube was made for kurzgesagt
Man I remember when this channel first started, Great work.
wish it didnt have the music. some reason its very uncomfortable to my ears :(
Holy shit imagine the file size of this
everyone will google "who is kurzgesagt's narrator" at one point.
love the music, good video to go to bed
1 hour?! Lemme get some snacks
great stuff!
Gorgeous visuals and hypnotic audio. Thank you for this.
thank you algue for inventing sex
Certified great for writing a PhD thesis too
This isn’t just a YouTube video, this is an experience, I watched the entire thing with headphones and the lights off and it left me completely speechless by the end. This should be a testimony to how special we really are, because it took nature billions of years to create us. ❤ We love you guys gurzgezagt❤
while you were watching this the Earth has been spinning at 60.000.000 rpm around the Sun
At first I wasn’t sure about the animation but as I kept watching I began to realize the genius in it. I loved it. I will enjoy watching it over and over.
Time to buy a dedicated TV to run this on loop on the wall :)
love how the bass in the mesoarchean chapter sounds like The Only Thing They Fear Is You. should've been in the hadean chapter tbh
NOW THIS, IS KURZGESAGTT💞💞
To think that Earth has been so many very-different places, each of which lasted for long enough that humans would consider every individual one an eternity.
Bill Wurtz did it in 20 minutes. Still a great video though👍
Please do one for the universe.
Very nice music! I like how it gets more and more organic as the times move forward. A lot of genres is represented. Cudos!
In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.
How does this exist FOR FREE??
Does the narrator spit at 39:54?
Your team and ancillary members of Kurzgesagt continue to put out amazing work. What an amazing time to be alive, I can only imagine what this would look like when Kurzgesagt VR comes... 😮😮😮
That was awesome. You should do something like this, but covering the evolution of the homo; from the last common ancestor up to today.
Awesome ❤
I’d love to have this as a visualizer playing in the background
I'm dancing in my kitchen listening to this while making a sandwich
beautiful!
One of the greatest pieces of edutainment in modern history. Thanks birbs.
sh¡t, I blinked
Now this is content
Wow this was so beautiful
My ADHD doesn’t let me pay attention for a full hour, let alone all of human history
Ambitious project, that's for sure, and I love it!😂
This would make for a fantastic class exercise. At the beginning of the class start the video,  and explain that this video has captured all of the history of earth and crunched it down into one class period. Then teacher would give out post it notes of different colors and have them write their names on them, and then explain that each post it color corresponds to a different major event (first dinosuars, "invention" of sex," the molten core forms, etc). There would be a time line on the board going from the start of class to the end, and over the course of the class, students are told what the events are and invited to put their post it note where they think it would be on the time line. Students could be given extra credit for getting close.
45:00 Thanks.
Me just realizing I can time travel by scrolling through the Video: “I’M STRONGER THAN THANOS” “SNAP”
I didn't see allosarus 😢
pure german engineering.
Bill Wurtz sent me here.
the best video!
You know it's good when even Mark Rober replies.
I wish there was a more concise version of this without all the pauses...
10/10 would watch again
Whatching this stoned af is just amazing
15k plus comments but only 800 plus likes, sort it out people.
why is no one talking about how fire the soundtrack is??
Who would have guessed the Mesoarchan era of earth was so METAL! 20 minute marker
That was Absolutely amazing & Enjoyable!!! Thank you all for the hard work. It is truly appreciated.
Its hard to believe some humans have enough money for $1 for every year of earths history.
The Cretaceous Extinction Event is truly a bummer indeed. Would have been cool if Dinosaurs are still around today.
This is beautiful but not what I hoped when Downloading this video for a long flight 😂😂
Commenting for the algo ❤
Help all of the video I watch only have 833 likes 😭😭😭
32:41 Did the team purposely made the middle lane of the video slide by faster? It is messing with my perspectives that further away objects should move less pixels than closer... And my eyes are bleeding.
Ingenious, once again!
It's so badass that life started during one of the most challenging periods in Earth's history. I love the feeling of being even a microscopic part in such a grand system.
Masterpiece ♥️
Fantastisch! What an endeavour that must have been to put together! Was glued to my screen from start to finish.
All this deserved praise, but no one mentions the absolute unit of a giga chad, the algae who invented sex.
What a perfect ending of the video. It truly made me realise how short we've been here. Thank you all so much!
Now that was satisfactory ❤
2k dislikes are beta males
Thank you! ❤️
GOATED
Wow! Shoutout to the musicians on the soundtrack as well! Mesoarchean was absolute 🔥🔥
Great idea, love it 👍🔥❤
Fucking amazing.
Don't Blink! Or you might miss the ad read interrupting your interest in human history! Thanks, You(?)Tube! After all, a business as large as Google™ must make money!
As soon as he mentioned the moon being made from a collision theory I was out
4.5 bil views, here we come!
Aliens are going to be so confused when they find this.
Every million views of this video is a world's worth of collective time spent.
Ultra geil
This needs to win every award under the sun Fucking Amazing
One of the things I really liked about this video is that the lack of information actually encourages looking up further information. I was jumping around from article to article on Wikipedia during and after this. Anything that promotes more curiosity is great!
Anyone else still vibing in the last 0.0000...........................1%
I usually like all videos from kurzs but this one didn’t really  entertain me
You guys should make a scarf out of this
Step 1: download video into phone. Step 2: go for a run with the video going in the background Step 3: Enjoy a run with the creation of the world.
7:21 "Much hot, and comfy." The best four words ever said by the Kurzgesagt narrator.
Time really flies huh....it only felt like an hour
Holy cow! This hit hard at 3 last night
Fantastic job man
I was going to casually watch. But I just couldn't get my eyes to look away for a second.
Had to watch it again. The scope of time here is amazingly impossible to understand in the best way.
this is crazy thank you for the video
Woa!! Earth had such cool musicians all the way back then !!
Just don’t forget @billwurtz’s histoey of the entire universe, i guess
I am curious how do we know the exact stages of earth and its condition? is it from deep layer of ice in antartica?
Can we get a video about our 🧠 brain thoo...
We're actually older than the Earth
Just want to note this: from the one hour video, everything from dinosaurs to us took 5 minutes, but there were +50 minutes of microbiological war when life perfection how unicelular life fight back the attack from another entities like viruses, which make rise to mechanisms like sexual reproduction, among many others: 4 billion years of evolutional force contained whithin those little nightmares.  Just think about it when the next flew-emergency rise and you are going to decide wether or not to take the next vaccine (which are around from just a hundread years on)...  you see, "life, uh, finds a way"
58:13  Jurassic park reference
I only counted 3 mass extinction events i thought there were 5  The 1 after the cambrian  The great dying in pre the Triassic The one they killed the dinos where did i miss two?
3 time watching
50:08 This is widely considered to be one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history
Tremendous work, thank you. 🙏
He said "Don't blink or you'll miss all of human history" and proceeded to literally end the video! JOKES!! I love it
According to this videi timeline life was unicellular for 85% of earth's history
Love love love this video!! Especially the music - so super shout out to the team. And then also appreciate the concept of 1-2 seconds for humans in the history of the earth. Makes my brain understand in a different way! ❤
Best video yet
Wow
Good try, but you can't outperform "history of the entire world i guess"
best animation ever...
Beautiful!  EDIT 17.11.2023: Currently the video has 4.6 mil. views :D (not billion though)
Terraria non 8bit sounding soundtrack
Mesoarchean music goes so hard
I just watched nearly an hour of almost nothing and still ended up entertained
And you are here, polluting the athmosphere, thinking that there is no chance humanity will get extinct for that
This was a wonderful journey. Amazingly done
Hilarious that the first sexual intercourse and reproduction ever had was by algae
Amazing soundtrack made it easy❤
I felt things 😊
Please, I beg of you do more like this!!!! ❤❤❤❤ This was awesome and my autism drank it up. 😢 The beauty!
It would have been interesting to add measurements for current air and sea temperatures, atmosphere composition, and atmospheric pressure
This will probably be Kurzgesagt’s most watched video ever. Incredible stuff!!!
can’t believe the cameraman walked for 4.5 billion years straight just for us
I felt like if I dont watch each second I just missed a million years. loved it so much. Respect to whole animation team who worked so hard to make this journey soo beautiful <3.
The fact that it took close to 3 billion years to get eukaryotic cells is wild
Hella boring
Ah hell, i blinked and missed 150,000 years. Now I've got to start over
Cried a little after seeing the planet booming with that much life near the end.  Amazing work.
Had me thinking i was listening to deadmau5!! Amazing movie guys
😂 Rhyacian: this is not how parallax works guys 😉
Oh lawd, Kurzgesagt snapped! 😮
I never considered what continents would look like before life. It's so alien. Life is so basic and permeates everything we know, it's strange to see a world where it's not there
Incredible psychedelic
loved every second if it! the music, the atmospheres, the ocassional explanations, what a magical journey!!
love the terraria ocean music on the neoarchaeon section
41:46 The first fun-guy like organisms extend their tubular arms and do fun-guy things.  Fungi is so old and yet they are the most mysterious organisms we have encountered. They fascinate me and I hope you guys make a video about it.
@kurzgesagt IS THE BEST. THANK YOU FOR HELPING MY DEPRESSION ❤
holy shit. What
So the oxidation event created co2 which cooled the planet... I'm confused I thought co2 warms the planet?
Tool's newest album is DOPE!
37:31
1:00:00, favourite part of the video
Hard to believe that a group of unknown scientists can make a beauty of a video like this. This is a work of art, a masterpiece. Im still wondering why you make content like this for free, in 1 hour i learned more about earths history than years in school. And i enjoyed it too. Thank you.  (Edit) Steves Voice is so calming i almost fell asleep to it lol
This feels illegal to watch for 1hour
This is a genuienly beautiful piece of work. The animation, the music, the narrative, everything ties together so well. I cannot thank your team enough for the time and effort that went in to it.
I don't have problems with imagining these time spans and I studied this, but I really like that the video puts it into proportion, because usually the first 52/60 minutes of this are put into < 1 % of texts and videos about Earth history. But that's just because we only can know so little about these times, because all of the information is lost.
I heard somewhere that the ocean was probably once purple
the true history of the entire world i guess
This proves it: The cameraman never dies!
Amazing! 🎉❤
I watched it till the end and it was amazing all along please continue doing amazing content like this !
you guys need to release some of this art as wallpapers for desktops and phones. beautiful art
🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
I love Kurzgesagt ❤
Im so insignificant
57:40 here it is boys
Is there a version without the narrator? I could totally see myself putting this in the background in a TV hanging out with friends
So Nostalgic Only Hadean era kids would understand
I knew human history would be short but damn...
Dont present this as facts these are all theories
Nice. But with better computer graphics instead of animations would be perfect
bill wurtz inspirations lol
All the music is composed too!!!
Can we just take a second and appreciate that this is for FREE...
What did we do to deserve an hour long video from kurzgesagt. Thank you for your outstanding work!!
music goes hard
I like this video better the first time I saw it, Bill Wurtz history of everything
I've had this video in the background 10+ times already, it's so good i cant get enough of it
The soundtrack to this entire episode is a banger
I've blasted it on my home TV and enjoyed every second of it <3
You should make a human history video and include Sumer, Babylon, Akkad, Rome, Korea the Chinese dynasty’s, Greeks and so much more!!! Thanks for the amazing video
The animation: flawless. The soundtrack: immaculate. The narration: perfectly concise. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
🙏 awesome
The sound track is one of the best things I heard in a while. Truly amazing
A video like this on human history, please, please, please. I'm waiting for that.
The first creatures to make $ex😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.   Great video😊
the moon slowly getting colder  satisfaction
This is brilliance in its purist form!
This video gonna be a base reference for thousand movies in the future
So beautifully done, I humbly bow to the creators. 🙏🏾
No mammoth...
In the Mesoarchean age 19:40, I thought Mick Gordon helped with the soundtrack :P
Pure genius, beauty, science communication as art... And bangin' tunes from Epic Mountain!!!
1 hour of Kurzgesagt for FREE!? This is what im thankful for this thanksgiving
Why is nobody talking about the music! A whole album has just been created for this video. Truely amazing!!
Nusssssss! 😍
"the calendar" video taught my that humans start in the last day.... why did I expect an extended explanation this time?  Amazing video!!
“19 million years have passed. We are still in the lava hell phase” has meme potential
I was running for 2.2 billion years while the earth was in making.
Probs to the cameraman for filming this all
An amazing video!👍
I'd love to have this as my wallpaper. Is someone able to do it on Wallpaper Engine??
Has anyone else seen this on *stuff*? Magical.
The music is so good with the amazing video!
You can make a religion out of this
The animation is so pretty these days
Kurzgesagt never fails!!!
You should do evolution of the moon
Aah yes, the OG earth-lore, now put beautifully by kurzgesagt!
I love this... but I wish there were more facts sprinkled in there... these long pauses of watching the same thing roll across the screen was... hard to sit through. My attention span isn't that good but I wanna learn cool shit.
I'm kind proud that Kurzgesagt is from german origin, kurzgesagt means shortsaid when translated word by word. Keep the good work up!
I am so glad to have been able to follow this channel and see it's creative, storytelling and animated development for a few years now <3 <3 <3 Since my interests of diseases and parasites i found this channels video on Ebola and from there i was hooked with all the videos produced from this channel. Everything from blackholes, space and the Fermi paradox to GMO vs non and Genes (Crispr) etc, these videos are so informative, easy to indulge and learn from!  This channel is amazing and it has been a pleasure to have follow it grow... This video is the best ive seen ever... Just loved the compossition of music and just love your style of animation and narrative story telling   Please never stop Kurzgesagt! Your team is amazing! <3
Very good video
When Aliens come to earth and want to know how we came to be we will show them this.
Great Video ! Please make same kind of video on history of human specie.
Hey guys I'm almost at 65 million years left to go and I'm gonna go get a drink, can you watch the dinosaurs for me?
Sometimes I come here to hang out in the Mesoarchean. Just love the vibes
An hour of animating must have taken 4.5 billion years to make this video! Good timing!
Thank you Kurzgesagt!
Wow! Thanks so much!
My favourite part is where the rocks went past
Lore recap irl
This music slaps
perfection
wait, there wasnt a iceage after dinossaurs asteroid?
Blaze up and watch this.
0:01 hello and strap in as we go 3 inches per 1 million years XD
"Life ... uh ... finds a way" - Love the Ian Malcom reference. And love the video. Learned a few new things today! If the Earth's inner core only formed a bit more than a billion years ago, does that mean the magnetic field has only been around for about that long?
OH MY GOD
This is beautiful,  thank you so much ❤
Hourfull of fake science 😂
In the middle of the video you shown rain again, was it raining alot of those millenia like in the beginning of the video?  Why didn't you show the moon more through its dynamic changes? Missed opportunity.
I think life survive either going deep into earth ocean, keeping alive due to the thermal vent deep in the ocean, or only adapted cell that start already live their, you can’t freeze all the ocean, thag is impossible. Or cells just froze cryogenic and after a thaw they continue to to wake up
This is amazing and truly shows how long the earth took to sustain life
My only complaint is that there wasn’t a kurzgesagt birb hidden somewhere in the animation…      …Or was there? (Have fun with that thought)
Best video evet 🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Awesome to work on some simulations with this as a background, beautiful work !
This video is an absolute masterpiece, a work of art that resonates deeply with its brilliance! Truly awe-inspiring!
I absolutely love all their content, but this may be the best one yet. I watched it through once, then later in the evening popped some edibles and watched it again. All I can say is do it-you’ll melt into this video.
This might be my favorite video on the internet
Amazing i love this content
Crazy how quick everything gets towards the end, humans have really been here for a blink
Its crazy that it took 40 min for the nucleus to show up… not as crazy as yall uploading this amazing HOUR long video!’
*Looks away for one second*  "The dinosaurs are dead"
ooh it is just a compilation of many videos throughout the year! ell you uploaded early i guess!
A feast for your brain, eyes and ears…
Thank you!! This is amazing
57:42 if you were wondering
So much mis information on this channel
not sure how to describe, it is like peacefully listening the time passed until where i am right now and how i created from nothing
3:11 aqui se vergiaron al Anakin
Some of these segments like this one 15:54 genuinely look like Mario levels
now i understand why finding life is so difficult
58:12 nice hat-tip.  Such a great video!
Could someone make a video explaining how we found/proved every knowledge in historic time?
Very good, amazing, inspirational
Thank you so much for the video
thanks for the cameraman filming all events until now for us.
I love this video ! I am currently at the 1 billion mark and I have 1 question: how long did it take you to animate this?
Put the average temperature on Earth, on the top Left Side please :)
Listen to this at 50% speed 2:06
Hold up, need to first call my dealer .
It feels like 4.5 Billion Hours have past by 😵‍💫
1:35 the floor is lava
The soundtrack on this video goes hard!
Absolutely amazing. You blend education with art, thank you so much for this.
Are we not gonna talk about how kickass this music is???
1 hour and no mentioning of how and why things happened. Unbelievable! ALLAHU AKBAR
As a geologist, I can only be in awe after watching this! ♥
imagine being the single-celled organisms that survived all this just so we can sit here and watch it today, and have all the credit go to an invisible sky daddy, no wonder they give us cancer.
I wish I had some 🪴 right now.
I remember that… feels like an hour ago.
David attumbrah but space
.
this is amazing... i can't even comprehend how long it must've took... great job
Anyone else waiting for him to congratulate you for watching a second time so you can feel good about yourself for a brief few million years again?
Not sure why it's so common when approaching these topics to say, what is at this point simply a cliché : "our brains can't fathom" these sort of timescales.  Yes we can, it's called an imagination! Maybe it was cute to say this when humans first discovered the approximate age of our universe etc... Otherwise great vid
ONE OF THE BEST VIDOES EVER ON THIS CHANNEL🎉🎉🎉
If I can watch a mindless cat video I can certainly watch a scientific masterpiece for a hour. Well done gentleman. Well done indeed
Ola😂
The relative durations of the "lifeless" epochs to multicellular ones is almost too much to grasp. Really cool
4,300 million years ago the beat drops 🔥
44:57 LETTTTSSS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Just incredible, there better be more content like this.
why there's a random glitch at 29:43
This kind of video style is awesome! But I doubt you will get a very good watch time relative to video length
I really enjoyed the video I sat there watching the whole thing I was so engrossed it took me awhile to notice how the animation was actually not like normal Kurzgesagt videos but was still good. And in the entire video I only noticed one bug in the animation where the lines in the water during the second period where stuck on screen. But other than that it was amazing and I love the science behind everything. I love all the videos about the history of earth and this was one of the more fun ones.
Why did you keep showing the same scenes over and over? It was boring. But I can't say it wasn't educational. Anyway, good job 👍
This was incredible. This must've taken years guys, thank you for your work
Ok but the soundtrack. Good job
So you took all this time in the Hadean to just not tell about Hadean at all? Genius move.
A real Kurzgesagt banger
W in the chat
Thank you 🙏!!! Your passion and your contents make us happy and informed… in a nutshell: Amazing
Amazing video, but really would have liked more narration. I loved it! My son and his grandfather kept falling asleep throughout though!
Nice video
This is an absolute masterpiece of knowledge.
Es una obra de arte, un monumento a la divulgación científica.🎉🎉  *Ojalá el canal en Español puede doblar esta joya*
So algae was the first to have an orgasm on planet earth?
The soundtrack unironically bops though
Тhis channel should be the most subscribed on youtube !!!
LIES! ALL LIES!  We know that the world is only about 6,000 years old!   Go back to Satan and stop corrupting our children!  (This post written by "Dr" Kent Hovind)
Insane
Thank you for working so hard on this! It’s incredible! ❤
Its so cool and amazing!!!
sees 1hour length... *heavy breathing*
10 years... its mad Thank you Kurzgesagt, another amazing one to add to the list, both animation and soundtrack was awesome!
This is incredible. I also wonder how long it will be before they can AI the animation and put more resources into the research and storytelling. That is, before we all go extinct!
Thank you creators for making this for us.
the kurzgesagt movie is out now
Bring the Earth back to it's origins, Vote Giant Meteor for 2024 if you want what's truly natural
Watching a science based overview of 4.5 billion years of Earth's history to the DOOM soundtrack is banger
Great video but the stock music ruins it a bit
59:50 Noooo! The non-avian dinosaurs! It killed the non-avian dinosaurs!
Hi I'm really late
well done on the sound design here - absolute legends
Before I watched this I knew the Earth was 4.5 billion years old. After I watched this I understood what that meant. Wow! Thanks, Kurzgesagt! This blew my mind!!!
AI generated?
“The homework won’t take long to do” How long the homework takes to do:
This is some of the most stunning visuals ever in a Kurzgesagt video I have ever seen.
watched the entire thing without skipping a second thinking it's the least i could do show my respect for the planet earth.
unreal video
Can you do a version with no speech at all ?
Tis videos like this that make you realize what an awesome platform youtube is. Kurzgesagt rules!!!
i love it. can we have video like that with out commentary and just this chilling vipe musics :) like sunsystem  in 60 min universe in 60min and and and ?? :)
Nailed it
The amount of effort and love put on this video is GIGANTIC! ❤️ Thanks to the Kurzgesagt team for such an amazing video full of scientific knowledge and information that should be shared all around the world! 🌎
Mesoarchean theme is legit amazing.
We are such a small part in the history of earth, but yet manage to destroy it to quickly
Can you do all history in mars
I'm not totally sure what the general consensus is on when homo sapiens first evolved, by the high estimate seems to be 300,000 years ago.   Cruising through time at 1,500,000 years per second, enough to make the history of our planet take 1 hour to get through, the entire histroy of our species blows by in 0.2 seconds.
Amazing job guys 🎉🎉🎉
that's great and all but it's ..too long
BRAVO! I was learning and partying for this whole hour ✨✨
The Earth's movie 🍿😲
Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell...... This is a pretty big fucking nutshell
I love how the music evolved as the eras continued on also i'm in the camp of thinking that life in the cryogenian era survived by either downsizing to live between the molten drops of ice, or intentianally let themselves be frozen
54:54
THIS IS BRILLIANT
The funniest part is that the ending had more time than human race and we think that we mean something in history of our world
youtube has to be lying to me because theres no way I was only the 8th like on this amazing and beautiful video.
This was really cool thank you.❤
Didnt expect tool inspired music 🔥
the music
Imagine if humans existed even a few hundred thousand years before the technological advances would be insane
Did you get tool to write the soundtrack to this?
Thank you so much
That was incredible! Thank you so much for that sci-trip experience!
Earth ain’t 4.5 billion years old😂
i would love a show like this but with the entire history of planet, idc if it takes years to put a chronological order of events on the formation of countries and what happen in each individual country in a nutshell, it doesnt have to go around every important individual of every country but it can briefly be mention, i don't think someone ever have tried this and this will be such a nice way to learn history rather than in pieces  if someone know's someone who did this please tell me id love to watch i love history :D
love the video
This couldn’t have come at a better time. It really calmed me down from some severe panic attacks. What an incredible piece of art.
It’s, a massive world aaaafter all
boring. you colud have made enough of the commentary to fill the long silent pauses. although I love you Kurzgest. but this was not soo good. maybe you can release the same video with the same time span, but in the backgrouund you are constantly telling us interesting facts about those eras. like you always do 😘
Why just earth and moon aren't merging... Because they seem so close..
How humans should eat a humble pie video
When you think nothing really "novel" can be invented, you come up with things like this. Thank you for the ride.
thank you for this
Where does God play a role in all this?
This video would make the most amazing live wallpaper I've ever seen.
Great Job once again! Thanks so much for teaching me while I am already laerning :3
It is free for many because others make it a point to support their work where they can :p buying their products, supporting through Patreon, etc
lofi beats to have an existential crises to
So… basically we could terraform mars in just… either 4.5 billion years, or an hour… 50/50
Hey can you make this same video but without words that would to relaxing to watch
Just btw if yout watching this and you're religious your God is fake
This is a phenomenal video. The journey is well worth the time. I want to shout a huge kudos to whoever is making the soundtrack for this video, it is very well put together. I was just as impressed by the music as I was the video! Kurzgesagt should consider releasing it as a standalone album. :)
You've always been one of the greateast illustrators and narrators, but with the music, this was next level. Congrats
You just created the Ultimate Screen Saver.
this is the greatest video i've watched this year
This is a Masterpiece.
I was married to the worst person in the world , I know what 4.5 billion years feel like. 😂
I'm going to have to set a whole separate 1 hour for this.
Wait I have doubts. So, in the very early times (around 3.5B years ago) the days were shorter. Then how did you clued the time? I mean how you calculate it is 3.5B years. And those years are dependent on days which used to be shorter. Now upon what the time is calculated? Is it 24 hours or what? 13:52
Just a little appreciation comment for the algorythm. Great job guys, fascinating what hard Work can do

Wait, what? "Much hot and comfy?" Is that a meme that I'm unfamiliar with?
Damn the cameraman is bloody ancient
Can we please get a download link for this? I want to put this on screen at some places, where internet is a bit tricky, and a direct link from the beamer to YT isn't possible.
First 50 minutes: Mostly long silent landscape shots  Last 10 minutes: Alright, time to see how much we can cram in here
This is what I needed today.
Thanks for doing this!! ❤❤❤
Great Video as always, I would like a version without music. Would be nice to have the ambient sounds just in the background playing :D
Please make one without the narration. I want to play it on the background wile im having sex and in a  deep LSD trip
Amazing work, team! Loved this video and the concept! :D
This might be the best Kurzgesagt entry yet
I'm in awe! Thank you so much for this video Kurzgesagt, this hour flew by like a second, I just didn't expect this. It's a masterpiece ❤
Excellent compilation
What’s astounding to me is that this entire process can’t be solely unique to earth as these building blocks exist everywhere
How did rain come suddenly?
I see the entire video. amazing job
2:12 why is the moon si big ij the background?
Great Video
This was the most beatiful and awesome animation that i have saw the entire year about educational content. Omg 😲
Absolutely AMAZING! Thank you so much
I was in awe of this for eons
One of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen
구르츠게작트 제작진분들에게 경의를
Great soundtrack!  Great animation!  Great narration!  Love it!
can you guys please turn this into a screensaver
thee soundtrack is insanely good.. actually mind boggling
I want this video as my background
That's cool! Would be nice to also get a non commentated version, as something to put up in the background.
45:01 holy shit.. we finally know who invented sex
Thank you for a 1 hour video to let run in the background while I do stuff, your voice and presenting style is good for this
Things started to get hot in the Stenian period 😏
I just watched the entire video and in support I  got myself and my daughter and granddaughter in Australia the Evolution Poster.  Thanks for all you do!
The transitions are smooth...
kind of makes this whole consept of human-caused global warming dwarf to absolute insignificance. 1.5 billion years of molting lava hundreds of millins of years of ice 2.5 billions of years of just no oxigen in the atmosphere and here we come with our ~150 years of industry. Yeah, right, this will definitely break the world.
It’s a great video no doubt and love the channel but a lot of this animation is on a loop. Plus of course there’s sponsors and the channel makes a lot of money—dependent on the videos being “free.” I hope the masses—the 24k likes thus far—get this. Again great video and a big fan but the masses seem uninformed of how YouTube works
can somone make a wall paper
wait a minute this is a kurzgesagt way of lofi.......   NICE
Kurzgesagt, you’ve made my weekend by uploading this.
This is peak. Bravo Kurzgesagt 👏
it's one of the most genius videos made by you guys <3
Beats to study and relax to Earth edition!
This wouldn't look out of place in a club.
Still people argue over religion.  Pathetic.
That was beautiful. It really put stuff into perspective
this was absolutely stunning, and so soothing. i plan to have this in the background constantly
Damn! There was a 1000 years long ad in the Eoarchean!
This is why i love this channel. The modern animal planet & discovery channel ♥️
PERFEECT!! This is going to be my new pomodoro video to study!!! @kurzgesagt please do a pomodoro technic video <3
51:50 I love how they adjusted the visibility at the sides with the ice. Looks so cool (no pun intended lol)
This episode was like a fever dream. Trippy as all get out
Such a masterpiece! 🦾🦾🦾
SHOUTOUT TO YOUR ANIMATION TEAM THIS THING LOOKS FANTASTIC
Next video - watching black holes evaporate, 1 billion year per 1 sec
Came for the science, stayed for the soundtrack. Mesoarchean goes hard.
Multicellular life has probabbly evolved at least 600 million years before this video says so
I had to put a reply on this one. This is fire. More long form content like this would not be opposed.
Woah!
Hola. Yo confío en ti y sé que te va a ir bien. Yo ya sé la verdad de este mundo y quiero compartírtela. Nosotros somos cada ser vivo en este planeta así como cada átomo que lo conforma. Te recomiendo leer “El libro de oro”, yo lo leí y me cambio la vida completamente  En mi experiencia propia deduje lo siguiente: La vida es como un videojuego muy social como la película de “Ready player two” o el videojuego de cyberpunk. Teoría: las drogas son la llave a ese mundo Si todos queremos bien para todos, todos somos dueños de este mundo. Las pantallas son la respuesta. Los negocios son los malos. La idea norteamericana de libertad es errónea  Yo no tengo enemigos. Si verdaderamente quieres saber la verdad, la verdad te hará libre, no tengas miedo de demostrar tu verdadero tú, si esa fuerza divina realmente es la que yo sentí ayer yo mismo decido quedarme en esa realidad. Nunca debes de dudar de ti mismo, no estas loco. Esa es la llave: nunca dudes de ti mismo ni de nadie ni de nada, no dudes, tu eres perfecto y yo lo sé.  Yo decidí seguir esa verdad y me hará libre. Yo confío en tí. Este mundo se maneja por la confianza. Si todos confiamos en todos, todos llegaremos a la victoria. Somos el hijo y el padre aprendiendo de lo bueno de este mundo. Nosotros mismos somos los que nos cegamos. El amigo en el que mas confías será el que vendrá a ayudarte. La droga no es más que los placeres en este mundo. Lo que todo padre quiere es lo mejor para sus hijos.
Imagine if the astroid never wiped out the dinosaurs, and they lived long enough to develop sophisticated intelligence, it could be a bored dinosaur in the middle of a 9 hour work day trying to waste some time on DinoTube 🦖
This is amazing work! I absolutely love it. Here’s an idea for a future project if you all are willing. Most science fans are familiar to the creation of earth. Well most of us. What always fascinated me is the creation of the gas giants. Do you all think you would be up for a video explaining how a gas giant like Jupiter formed? If not, that’s cool I love the content regardless, thank you so much for your work!
Weird how much like genius this is if you don't take the 7 days literal
Okay cool, but I would also need an ASMR version so I can sleep to this 🥺
This is going to be my favourite video on youtube for sometime ❤
Great job 🎉
Wow!! Congratulations on this project and thank you so much for bring this to the world!! This is absolutely amazing and beyond anything I expected from this already amazing channel!
I haven't watched it yet but it's my favourite video of all time already!
I love your content! Thanks for the ten years!❤
this was soo good! I want one more....from The Big Bang till earth's formation.
Funny how we only exist 12000 or something and f*cked up the planet
amaizing video, could be interesting a newone about human history, i blink for a moment and i lost that part
I like this video very much since I have never seen something like this before. Thanks☺️
Ah, finally, I can let the sand of time wash over me, like a warm breeze.
can we please take a moment and appreciate the amazing music epic mountain created for this stunning artwork?
This. Is. Amazing!! Kurzgesagt never ceases to one-up themselves, and this for sure is one of the most brilliant work of education I have ever seen! I hope it will get the success it deserves
Awesome video
This needs to be a silent disco ASAP!
This has to be one of the best animated pieces I've ever seen in my life. Not only on youtube, in general.
How long to edit
I’ve got a question for any of you passers by in the comments: If you could live in any time period pre-civilization, which would it be? You’d still be human, by the way.
This is crazy, i cant even make a decent 1 minute animation
If you showed a video of this but it was 13.8 billion years in a nutshell
Definitely the coolest video you’ve made
1:36 "The floor is lava" ;)
Awesome! Congratulations to everyone who brought this project to life! This is stunning! A way to get a grasp of how Eath lived until now! Brilliant!
Now make an edit with narated parts only
Unbelievably Amazing Content as usual!! Best channel on YouTube!!  Review: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This is kinda fun when you look at the dinasours and the human history just passing in 2.4 million years!
I loved the progression in the music from cyberpunk during the first phase, to softer cyberpunk and gradually morphing into classical-nature in the end
Todo list :  Read comments  Check other videos Write ur kurztgesagters ❤❤❤
If art and science had a baby, it would be Kurzgesact.
wow the music goes so hard
Ohaaaaaa naptiniz mq ya ethnic deep house ile kurtzgesagt nedir ya şaka mı ❤❤❤❤
well done
You've been working on this since 2019?!?! AKA 4 years ago??
I wonder what is left of the hadeon considering he said almost nothing remains
Since 2019!
A M A Z I N G <3
Emmy Award!
Its taken me 1475 million years to eat my lunch 🤯🤯
There are no words to describe how relaxing and calming this was
DAAAMMMNNNNNN
Yess... just yes... This video is perfect! <3 Perfect background music, great animation, amazing sciency facts, and a playful vibe. I love this channel!
Now im gonna wach it for 3.5B years
This was just the most magical experience ever, such wonderful work <3 Thanks Kurzgesagt for the trip through time You're the best
I love how amillocaris is the highlight from sponsorblock
Älskar filmen ❤
W animators but kinda a waste of time cuz the earth ain’t even that old 💀
Amongus rock in paleoarchean
Amazing.
middle of Mesoarchean soundtrack is giving me Isis vibes (the band not the terrorist organisation) 21:32
You missed the chance to call this: _"History of Earth in a nutshell I guess"_
is there a way in which we can collaborate with this animation, by example: doing some animations for the hadrean and eoarchean and the complexity of chemichal processes that were happening
I didn’t see the transformers
This is insane. Y’all did something that is almost never done due to the time it takes
Kurzgesagt is easily in the top 5 best YouTube channels without a doubt.
It rained for 100's of millions of years straight. Earth was thirsty.
Bezos is worth 100 billion dollars. Let that sink in
At 19:40 I thought they were going to go all Doom Mick Gordon on us
Bill Wurtz did it better
10/10 probably the best background music, I had it on while typing my essay, as well as when I was on a run, great vid!
Watching on 10^‐6 speed right now.  Feels like I'm actually there.
44:59 - Shout-outs to the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens for being a total champ.
This feels a little like listening to a The Ocean album
that was beautiful, thanks.
I like your videos. Educational and fun at the same time!
I hate the succubus comments written by bots
There are 2 things that the human brain just doesn't intuitively get. One is exponential change, like compound interest, or other feedback loops. The other is the insanely large scales of things like time and space. This puts at least one of these into some amount of perspective.
The credits lasted longer than human history.
Must be my birthday today
Every single time I see that blue dot next to kurzgesagt's channel I hit that in damn near a nanosecond cause their channel is just so GORGEOUS 😍🥰
We need such looped animated background for our desktops, absolute masterpiece!
The absolute madmen!
Then have xqc "react" to it 😊
God... 7 days.... yeah right
impossible for human brain
This is so cool! It’s like those fireplace videos people just play in the background. I can’t wait to use this instead.
Fun fact: this music you hear in the background was also present 4.5 billion years ago. This is the origin of calling musical tracks "fire".
How oxygen existed at that time? 1:30
Never thought a YouTube video would change my entire perception of the world but wow this video was amazing
Wow! This will be fantastic for my students.
Amazing work!
Well this was an astonishing piece of work.  I also really like this format of "background-friendly video", and I hope it inspires more of the kind.
Just remember the journey is tough, but so our you.
Wow! How fab was that? Thank you for your work 😊
Earth 4.5 billion year anniversary 🎉 let's goo
In Mesoarchean if there's water on the surface and steaming water on top shouldn't there be hydrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere from the breakdown of water?
When I start doing something with this in the background I focus so much I don't even hear what the narrator said, just a few seconds later I'm like "did he said something new?" and I have to rewind it to see if I missed something. My brain just can't focus on both at the same time lol
I didn't expect that thrash metal moment. Amazing production here.
Beautiful video
bill wurtz clears you
I've been following you guys for the last 5 years. You absolutly Rock! Please do collab with some good dj and do history of the universe in 1h ❤❤❤
The music for the mesoarchean absolutely slaps.
If you pause the video after watching for a while you'll see the screen sliding to the right slowly 🥴
Wow wooow woooow… i’ve watching Kurztsagt for years, i know how much effort they do in one single video. This is mind boggling mind blowing from kurzgsagt that thay uploaded 1 hour video… i think they just forget about their budget 🎉❤
This. Is. Utterly. Amazing I cries multiple times while watching this just because the illustrations and music together with the idea I just watched a short version of the history of the earth. I love you guys at the kurzgesagt team so much. You are amazing. 🎉
The algae bangiomorpha pubescens made the world a better place
The fact that people conquer the earth for only 4sec is truly mind-blowing
Appreciate the effort. Kudoos 🎉
Show this a Creationist.
😊wow tan increible como cientifico. se lo enseñaré a mi hermana pequeña muchas gracias ❤
4.5B made up stories by so called Scientist which age range into 50-90yo and talking about 4.5B years so called stories 🙃
Amazing
this is basicaly a funky version of the history of the entire world i guess don't get me wrong, i like both of em
Feels like playing Dune 1 game while listening to the video's music.
❤☺👍❤
I watch the whole 1:03:31 and I love every second
Amazing!
Props to the cameraman for going back in time and enduring that hellish journey back to the present. At least he has some banger music all throughout
19:57 The Djent era has begun
Planning to make this my windows pc wallpaper with lively app.🤔🤔
sick soundtrack
After watching bill wurtz too many times I'm struggling to get used to this pace
wonderful 💔
Well done, and thanks. That is a very nice and epic video story of Earth
You guys at Kurzgesagt are the change we need to see in this greedy world❤
I didn't blink at the end!
The music is great! Who made it?
The Qur'an "Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six days" (7:54).
Can we get the music please?
Wow, this kind of content is without exaggeration one of the most important things to have ever been made on youtube, and epitomizes the usefulness of the internet. Truly a gift to humanity.
Kurzgesagt are setting the bar way too high. My expectations now of other channels are impossible to match.
1 Corinthians 6:9-10 King James Version 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
doesnt this just contradict all religious people
i once had dream like this, i dreamt finally earth reaching it ends, but the voice over on my head said "it's not the end, it's only yours end for now" and then starting to watch earth from the very beginning. i only lived for 25 years, that's still a very little time rather than what earth been through~  thankyou for making thisss great illustration and motionnn love you guys. danke!!!
Thank you for the journey , relaxing and educational at its very best.
The moment you pause the video and your whole world starts to move backwards in time... I mean to the right... 😅
I've learned more from this channel than in all my years of primary school...  If this existed in the early 80s, I might be a molecular biologist or professional botanist.
My new favorite video !
Animation is good al always, but the music! The tempo is very good for exercising. I watched the video while biking and did 1 hour without even realizing My body now hurts a lot. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
Very doom like music around minute 19^^
Bro
Amazing video!!! Very nice soundtrack ❤
Kurzgesagt uploading videos: 1month per video  Kurzgesagt uploading documentaries: We can do it over the weekend
Love it, I can see myself working with this on for hours and hours
I needed this
Humans were the scariest part
you say life forms before water ??? before the oceans are formed? that's. new to me, can you elaborate? 8:50
Why life only started once on Earth?🤔
"still much hot and comfy" ??? is this an AI or something ???
best video so far I m amazed, I would even pay for this a full premiere movie price
This music absolutely slaps.
Just thinking about how absurdly short modern human civilization is with respect to all of Earth's history is mindblowing. Even if the video runs at 60 frames per second (and each second would represent 1,5 million years), a single frame would already be 25 thousand years. That's already more so than our beloved Kurzgesagt calendar goes back in time (to the year zero). In other words, we wouldn't even fit in a single frame in this video!
Absolutely gorgeous work 😘
Thank You very much for this, so much knowledge filled, RESPECT🤗🥹❤️
To much effort for a theory which might not be true
the viewer retention on this will be abysmal
I love it so much, but please stop telling people all the dinosaurs are dead when birds _are_ the dinosaurs that survived
Wait… are we aliens?
It’s the audio that kept me engaged! Good job!
The very last frame of the part with humans, is me watching this video over 400 million times.
Awesome thank yiu
You definitely know your audience
Props to the cameraman as always
This is just beyond incredible. I am amassing at the work and dedication put into this, and even more impressed that I’m able to relax and enjoy all 60 minutes of this masterpiece!
I would loved if the video had just sound effects of what’s happening on the screen than the electronic upbeat tempo
Beautifull
I love this! I simply love this! I can't decide if this is a work of art, cartoon, or a science lesson. Thank you for making science fun and interesting ❤
I LOVE THIS!!!
Thank you for this master piece!
Sadly, the first ten minutes had more potential. Why were there so many asteriods hitting the earth? Why did it rain so much and so on.
Do you want to watch incredible videos?
theres. patch of a-lack-of-water at 12:26 that vanishes. this is a veiw ruening error that i will be un-ssubscribing because of (jk)
This is a blessing
0:55 - 11:32 love that track
Great video :D great efforts
! JESUS, THAT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VIDEO I'VE EVER SEEN
It took be about 2 billion years to realise that the beat of the music was in sync with the years counter.
This was an amazing dj set!
Love this channel with a passion. What a time to be alive!
Can't believe this is free!. Amazing!
Congratulations on 10 years!
This is awesome! The music describing the different periods and the subtle transitions between the pieces together with the animation certainly invoke a lot of complex feelings. Thank you for this amazing perspective!
I just ran with this in my headphones and the tracks are absolute bangers
1 hour epic muisc🎵
This was amazing! Thank you for all the hard work!!
wth 29:43
Another superb piece of Internet added for all the world to see. Thank you for all the hard work.
This is amazing! Thank you so much for making this and taking the risk of trying new experimental stuff. These experiments, like the egg, are some of my favorite videos from the channel and that by no means is a comment on the quality of the more standard ones. Keep it up!
Sometimes I wonder, if you folks are even aware of what you're doing to society...  I understate the case when I say that this is a true masterpiece.  Thank you! Thank you for what you've done! And thank you, for what you'll have done! Love from Berlin. ❤
The sound sounds like GTA VI 💲
insane
I know a guy who did it in like 20 minutes 😂
41:41 so, you could say they were *_The First of Us_*
This is insane, I learned soo much! Thank you Kurzgesagt
as a animation student i love how yall always have smooth and amazing timings on ur animation amazing
I'm going to put this as my wallpaper!
Yo more earth lore just dropped!!! Hoping it becomes canon this time.
incredible video
It’s insane to see how long Earth was in its development before life, let alone visible life, made an appearance.
History of the entire world I guess
Gonna binge this after work tomorrow. Can’t wait to see what you brought to the table!
I am high this will be crazy boys
Awesome video - I didn't know that the Doomslayer already existed in the Mesoarchean era AND that he was apparently chilling  somewhere just off camera 19:40 - His music was a little calmer than today, but still cool!
Don't blink.  You'll miss us.
Large numbers are hard to visualize.  This video really offers a new way to begin to appreciate how long 4.5 billion years is.  The fast counter timing representing a million years with the hour long format was a great choice!
29:43 rip compression artifact 51:11 cleanest transition yet
the music at the mesoarchean period goes hard
Me just vibing in Club Hadean ☄️☄️🕺🕺🔥🔥🕺🕺
Wow
Belated happy 10th anniversary to my favorite channel since 2019!! Keep making lotsa masterpiece of an art
I love everything about this. Noone can convince me that the Kurzgesagt crew isn't a bunch of magicians.
Words can't describe how breathtaking and insanely beautiful this is. A marvel of animation and education. Thank you so much! ❤
A master piece... and showing us, that Earth will prevail, whatever will come.
Happy anniversary! Been following you since Hadean
0:51 gives terraria players flashbacks to their first experience with the solar pillar
Love this
This was a good idea in theory but making it a very long video with long moments of no talking makes it hard to watch. Constantly skipping ahead to get to the information...
Not 3 min in yet but you’ve already got at least 2 views outta me. I’m going to fall asleep to this right now, but definitely will watch it again when I can pay attention. 😂❤
Another excellent kurzgesagt video
wow
It's not 4.5 billion years old 🤣🤣
Epic Mountains had a productive session
What’s interesting to me is if you were to zoom in on the last second of the video and show the whole of human history, it would resemble this video — very slow at first, then gradually accelerating until ... don’t blink.  There’s some kind of fractal self-similarity in all this.
Nice
How can u be so talented Kurzgesagt?????lOVE u
I loved this!
All life would be dead, years from now. I'm looking forward to see the year "2037", yes indeed. The year 2045 could be awesome yet
I blinked xD
Amazing work!
Вопрос - а откуда взялись дожди и облака? Была лава, вулканы, потом это все почему-то стало остывать (это первый вопрос). И потом откуда взялась вода, да ещё в таком количестве?
The way u guys been sharing knowledge totally deserves a humanity award 🎉
The instrumentals on this just slaps! Noice
"this transparent layer masks this layer but that other layer that reveals these two layers should not be obscured by this layer but it should be by that layer but that layer is on top of that layer so we split this layer into multiple layers and layer the layers like the layers they are. WHY ARE THE BUBBLES SHOWING IN THIS SCENE?"
Make a timelapse of each historical period of each continent please!
This is amazing! Please make more videos like this!!
Nice job!
You are the besttttttttt!❤❤❤❤👏👍❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤💔♥️❣️❤️‍🩹💋
This is amazing. So much time and effort, thank you so much kurzgesagt!
Amazing Video Guys!
Hour long kurzgesagt video?! We've been blessed
but out of what did earth get born?
Earth is 4.5 billion years old. But what if...   it wasn't? 🤔
Can someone tell me where all that water comes from after earth was a cooking sea of lava for 500 million years. And afterwards it rains for several million years. But how?
wha??? Kurzgesagt is celebrating the 10th anniversary???😱Gosh makes me feel like I am a grandma🥲
Great background music for naughty times
Well done on the music :)
These would make incredible moving wallpapers for desktop
really nice video .Thanks for such amazing content
make a short out of this, it's way too long.
The boring history of the Earth!
Kurzgesagt in a nutshell: 1. Oh, what's that? A meteorite! 2. Oh no, it's killed all dinosaurs! 3. Anyway. Look! Mammals!
I can't even imagine how long this must've taken, great job
45:00 "Nothing much happened. Except sex."
bill wurtz did it better
Goofy sentece alert 41:42
Awesome
This is why I study Geology
👍👍
I now know when sex was invented, thank you Kurzgesagt.
Love this idea
1h of kurzgesagt, dont mind if i do!
Nice approch to tell history! I wonder how it looks 4.5 billion year in future!? 😮
Not much geological information.
0:25 1 billion years into the future
Why are the clouds diagonal?
Since no one seems to be mentioning it, the music is fantastic. Such a bop.
Is that Terraria music around 52 minutes in?! Hahaha
So life discovered sex in Stenian era. Without that, we would not have existed.
Thank you for all your hard work!
Great video! Hope people apreciate because it must have taken ages to animate.
So nice! Thank you!
This is my new 'The War Of The Worlds'! Can we get a music and background sounds version?
I can't believe I watched all of this in normal speed
This is one of the most beautiful and enlightening videos I’ve ever seen. Stupendous work!
Pretty accurate I would know I was there
After 13 minutes guy said "Good Job if you still watching" and I answered "Thank You". I felt like Joey from "Friends" 😂 Je m'appelle Claude 😅
Hi,   my name is Daniel, I am 38 years old and come from Hannover. I turn to you today, because I just have no other possibility and must now make the most unworthy of what you can imagine: begging. At 17 I found a rare spinal cord disease: an AVM - arteriovenous malformation. Normally one finds them in the head, so not with me. This is to explain it simply, a slippery sponge caused by too many small bloodlines that accumulate at a point in the case: at my spinal cord. At that time, 2002, this happened when I was on a Lan Party, and the whole weekend could not pinkle. Several investigations were then made and one decided to close these too many blood flows with a kind of glue.   When I was awakened after the surgery it happened, I couldn't move my legs properly and didn't feel it any more, so the problem with watering could not be solved until today, I had to use roughly 1 in 2000 Countless Rehas have been standing since then, but at some point I had no pleasure anymore and I started to find out that I had to go on support for my life. I was lucky and had found a woman who was also cautious and we got married in 2016. A year later, my father, while I was sitting at his hospital bed, died exactly on my 1st floor. Wedding day, on cancer. The second great depression of my life. By 2020 my mother had a stroke at work, at any rate it was believed at that time, I decided to walk with her in September 2020 the same time, it was difficult to see. My mother left the Reha after 3 weeks, I stayed two more weeks, she didn't like me all the time at all, she was somehow forgotten.   Well, when I was back at home, my mother called me and said as 1st, I will never forget this sentence, "yes, now we have the salad", she was again in MRI brain and it showed. After a sample was taken, it was found that it was a glioblastoma, the worst there is, no one survives it and most die after a year of diagnosis. My mother didn't seem to understand it so well and believed it could simply be operated out. After my birthday, in Nobember 2021, she came to a hospice where I visited her every day, I could hardly walk for any reason, so I took a woman fortan In January 2022 she left me, quasi while I was sitting on my mother's deathbed. She barely understood something and almost no longer recognized me, first the memory, then the eye light and finally her heart stopped working, finally, you have to say.   There I sat without a wife, without parents, and I have to look for an apartment by the way. I then found one, on 1.9.22 it was announced that on the day I sent my latest MRI pictures to the very well known neurosurgeon Prof. Vajkoczy by post, physiotherapy. Somehow it suddenly sounded very funny in my head and an indescribable pressure spread, all came to help, I handed myself over, suddenly the room was full of notary people and I could see nothing more. Luckily I was at the Physio. Now the cause of brain bleeding was this annoying AVM in my back, which was glued at that time, also the reason why my run became worse and worse. The sticker had completely detached and the blood shot me in my head when practicing, witty when you think about it half hour before I sent away my new pictures. Well, I had a lot of luck that was quickly traded, no lasting damage.   I was back in many rehabilitation centres and was finally operated at the top named Prof. vajkoczy in the CHariteth. Since then I have disposable nerve pains starting from the Po up to the feet, as if I had fed a pants with sandpaper. I can no longer run, do not stand up, he has "dissolved" my complete nerves, but does not, of course, allow this. A care case, with care step 4. This damned year 2022, mother, woman and the ability to run and have joy, all lost. The only thing I still have to do with my friends, as at the time at the above-mentioned Lan Party, we are still hitting today.   And there we come to my real concern, sorry I swear short, I wish so much a Gaming PC and finally a good monitor since I can think I always have the biggest Rotz mill from our round. Unfortunately, I can be a small job. Pensioners don't want to do much and ask you if you see a chance to help me? I would be infinitely grateful to you, but if not bad, ask, I thought, it costs nothing.   dear Daniel
i was genuinely shocked when i realized there were NO repeat frames
This is one of the coolest videos I've ever found on YouTube! The Kurzgesagt Studio must have worked hard to create this brilliant masterpiece.
I love how at the Orosirian area it looks like a lifeless dunes,truly amazing how our planet's life was formed.
any of these 228660 frames can be a wallpaper
Sorry guys bill wurtz did this in 20 mins. Good effort though
Ngl I almost teared up at the end. Humanity is so young and we're already on the verge of wiping ourselves out. At least with the other guys who came before us, it was completely out of their control whether or not they survive.
this was a great video to learn about history and have a good soundtrack to write one of my essays to, I'd love to see more!
yooo ts insane
rlly wanna travel back to the rhyacian bc the music was banging
This is the pinnacle of YouTube. Such a creative use of video length that only Kurzgesagt could execute like this.
Wow
The music from Ectasian to Tonian eras is giving me serious 'Tool' vibes. This soundtrack is incredible!
Earth really doing on ehell of cultivation isn't it?
The human era is not even 2 seconds...
The sound track, The animation, The narration... Everything is just perfect  Thanks guys... I use this video to calm myself down
For the amount of content the video is unnecessarily stretched
Simplesmente um dos melhores canais do YouTube postando um dos melhores vídeos do YouTube e saindo sem dizer nada. Mas agora falando sério, que vídeo bom cara, uma hora disso é simplesmente insano, parabéns pros animadores e que eles continuem com esse trabalho árduo e esplêndido que sempre fizeram. Edit: terminando esse video eu tenho que falar, QUE TRILHA SONORA BOA, mano esse video foi um alivio e uma crise existencial ao mesmo tempo, nao consigo nem descrever isso em palavras, muito bom kurzgesagt, CONTINUEM
I love this video sm.
Thanks kurzgesagt!
Congrats to the sound design and music team, they did an amazing job!
Bravo! Very well done 👏👏👍 Humans appearing in the last second was hilarious 😆
Im definitely not sending this to a Christian person
The fact that we can watch all of this for free is insane!
i watched it whole with my gf. Now i wil use this at Lofi Planet creation beats to read/ study to :-P
This is the absolute most amazing "video" I have ever watched on YouTube. Thank you so much for the years of effort put into it, I cried so much by the end and I have already shared it with a bunch of people and will share it with my students as well (I don't care that I work in a Catholic school and might ruffle some feathers!).  Thank you thank you thank you 💛
LUCY!
Congrats to cameraman to survive 4.5b years to bring this to us
felt that life went wrong in one moment, earth usually takes millions and millions of years to change its look/composition, but for humans it took like a couple of millions to bring it to almost the point of no return, and already have the ability to do more damage to it in a single sec than the astroid wiping the dinosaurs. (i mean if full scale nuclear war begins its done, we all gonna get fucked)
your video are so inspiring it makes cry sometimes by the way i have bird his name is Buddy and he watches your videos with me
hello world
The animated Wallpaper we didn't know we needed
I only knew it was the Cambrian Explosion because of the history of the entire world, I guess.
Biggest music producer flex of all time
i wonder if we went around the world
The history of the world, i guess.
So I can watch the beginning of earth forming, to the first life form, then to the dinosaurs evolving in the time it takes my girlfriend to get dressed.
That was a realy great vidéo so good job for your long years work. The only thing i can say negativly is that they were to much moment not interresting because nothing happen it can have be better if not evry second were necessaire to make us understand the path of earth
Moon to Earth in the first billion years:  Moon: Hey Earth what u doing? Earth: Chillin!
absolute banger
this is my favorite video ever
Will there be a version with only bagground music?😅
Man just give the hands of your whole team, I just want to smooch it so bad....
This could easily be a projection at a rave party. The music is perfect as well.
This is truly the best looping bagground ever created.😄
The soundtrack for this is wonderful.
source: trust me bro
Came for the science, stood for the sick as hell and chill metal music that I didn't expect.
The Earth has seen worse, climate change isn't about the planet, the planet is fine, WE are in danger.
Amazing timeline 😍😍
Sure was nice of Kurzgesagt to leave lots of space with no talking for the reactors to add their insightful and transformative commentary!
WHO was in the studio???????  Edit: Since 2019 is crazy, this is a special video <3
The soundtrack is just superb! Awesome job by epic mountain!🔊
studying for my ancient history exams, i kept getting distracted by the time passed since the civilisations of ancient mesopotamia. this put that in perspective, showing that even the sumerians are so close to us today. a small existential crisis, but it was a beautiful experience!
Love this channel <3
Netflix has a documentation about exactly that.
It took 4.5 billion years of evolution to make this masterpiece of a video!
Amazing. Thank you.
Bill Wurtz did it in like 8 minutes 🤷‍♂️
Must be the best Video on Youtube!
Thank you for making this video. We love your passion projects!
I think North Wales may still be in the Eoarchean period.
Now make a realtime video
this is amazing, kurzgesagt is the best👏👏
You can't just say: "Sure, why not". The main reason why people think that climate change is not a big deal is because they don't understand why or how ice ages and the like have happened before
У висоус был много лет назад похожий таймлапс, захватывающий историю человечества. Это пробило меня на невероятные эмоции тогда, и продолжает поражать до сих пор.
Please can you release a version without the speech? Of course love the speech and the learnings there, but the music / visuals are also great for background during work. Would be amazing <3
that's some serious commitment to worshipping Gaia...almost religiously...
3:50 Drums were invented very early in earth's history.
The history of everything, i guess
59:45 best transition ever.
Definitely one of my favourite videos of all time
I’ve watched an insane amount of content on Youtube over the years, but your channel is without doubt the number 1 content on here. Amazing work!
24:10 Neoarchean
This video must have some awards from some organisations or something ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Did…did you just say a one hour video? This is the best day of my life!!
Nice Video
awesome
This is an absolute masterpiece 💕
We so desperately need this content in other languages, I’d love to be able to watch this with my kid
There is the "boring billion" now it's the "boring video". Just kidding the concept is awesome ;)
Anyone else heard terraria soundtrack?
Beautiful. Just. Beautiful.
Tonian is giving me Tool vibes :)
I can't believe we get this insane video content AND progressive musical masterpiece for free.
Cheers for The camera man 🫡
Can you guys make a video explaining human evolution from start to now? Like from the first microorganism, to the first multi-celled organism, the first time an organism saw it fit that it needed a partner and genders evolved, the first time a creature evolved eyes, and taste and why that would have had to happen, how the subtle differences that define evolution go unnoticed for generations etc…
can't believe it took 120 million years to brush my teeth, at least I know they're clean now
The music really slaps
You guys have outdone yourselves, Idek what to say
The final moments bring a sudden self awareness of just how infinitesimally small our lives are. We typically only live about 80 years. That's it... Our humble little lives are smaller than a nutshell within a nutshell of a nutshell's nutshell. All of humanity is just a blink right at the end.
This is some insane shit here, mar respect for the animators
Does anyone know what the soundtrack at 58:47 is called?
The soundtrack is insane
Every secondary schooler should watch this video during their natural history class to understand how long 4.5billion yrs really is and how short we've been here in comparison.
I bought a poster for my nephew from your store to support you for making videos like this. Congratulations to your team. This is something to be proud of and celebrate!
Oddly satisfying, play it in background for my focus work!
At 58:40 when the human era song starts even thow we are still million years before the humans. Brilliant ! <3
59:35 my kind of humor xD
Best video giving real experience of how all of earth history was and how long this period was
Your best video ever! I'll be playing this one over and over, thank you!!
That soundtrack is fire ! Terraria reforged
First astroid hit -> all quite visually with no astroid. I've never been let as much down by Kurzgesagt visuals as in that moment ^^ There's a serious lack of depth to the info in this vid but all in all pretty chill.
Amazing
This is fun and obviously took a lot of work. It's probably too late now but I would have suggested a small text box that showed average surface temperature and the main atmospheric gases. It would have also been nice to have seen the Moon slowly decrease in size in the sky.
By far the best video on YouTube, and I usually look for booty and video games videos.
amazing
Amazing. I loved it. Welllllllll done, bravo/ brava!
Love this history timeline. We will collect more info about giant fungus era before tree get tall on land. Guess most of fungus forest turn into coal mine now.
@kurzgesagt_kr
Just started to watch. I wonder if all of written history even gets a single frame in the end.
This honestly might be the coolest thing you've ever made! Keep up the awesome work!
WHO THE HELL PUT INTERMISSIONS INTO SPONSORBLOCK????? STOP. THE WHOLE POINT IS TO WATCH THE TIMELAPSE
The neoarchean theme has some terraria vibes to it.
shoutout to the animation and music team!
"Hope you felt something watching this." is probably the best epilog ever. And I did.
So cool! ❤
The OST ist just awesome.
This felt like playing EVO again.
I have to say, I love all the faces on the rocks in the Mesoarchean
it would have been nice to see what probably caused the different changes, here we just jump from magma to ocean to ice in an instant
I'm just thinking about the intern who had to watch this to spot any rendering errors xD
Watching this makes me wish there'd be a successor to the game Spore - even though it's from Ubisoft and had its fair share of problems, it was awesome to go through the evolutions from basically "the very beginning".
If nasa ever does a Voyager 3 type thing this video should be on it
Absolutely love this. Thank you to everyone at Kurzgesagt, youre too kind to us. Love everything you do
If this doesnt qualify to win a streamy award, i dont know whats up or down any more
Thank you for this, this is amazing work
34:04 save for where i was
This must be one of the best videos on the internet. I'd like to see the same concept with something like "800 Million Years in 1 Hour" (to have a more detailed glimpse on the history of complex life)
Can’t wait for the sequel to come out
animation’s and transition’s:1Qn/10 you are now in 1st place in my learning category 1st:you 2nd:be amazed 3rd:bright side
"1 Hour of Funky Prehistoric Jams to Contemplate the Vastness of Time To!"
I thought this was going t5o be similar to bill Wurts's history of the earth I guess but still amazing
Just wao...
platypus bg :))
01:01:42 yeah I felt something, like I always do watching kurzgesagt, best channel ❤
Much more thorough "history of the entire world i guess"
Video- Let's make history Fun! 3:49 - FunKY, that is!!!
anyone else studying??
Awesome Video and Banger Soundtrack!🤟🔥
I have not been happier.... thank for this kurzgesagt
I don't hope current global leaders watch this clip, I hope future global leaders have seen this clip
The sun is a deadly laser
This is something else… let’s call it 'educational art' 👌
And the human history was a YouTube ad...
Free Palestine
respect for the animatorsss
.
thanks for the work! Watched it, liked it, shared it (x5) <3
Man.. I loved it ❤
the first time I watched a youtube video until the credit screen was over, I also read the names! great job!
Gotta love the music, perfect choices and mix!
Excellent
Can you release this as Screensaver/Desktop Background for Windows / macOS? ❤
How can i get the background music?
But where is moon, and how moon formed??!!
45:00 Bangiomorpha pubescens is so based for that
Finds this video at 4 AM, guess I'm not going to bed any time soon
*When Atatürk introduced the term "bayan" (female formal suffix like Mr.) into modern Turkish* -Ibrahim Pasha: My pasha, wouldn't it be better if the term 'mademoiselle' had another word as well? -M.K. Atatürk: Perhaps you're right, however, referring women with different names before and after the marriage is what I'd consider as backward savagery.  +Little anecdote for sharing this wonderful masterpiece at 10th of November. Thanks for the wonderful work Kurzgesagt, it's mesmerizing. Especially thanks for the audio-mix team who made a song listenable for 4,5 Billion years straight without getting bored!
Imagine if they ended the video by saying "but anyways, this was history of the entire world, I guess"
I was just vibing to the music :)
4.5 Billion years feels like an hour ago 💀💀
Absolutely brilliant, thank you for another highly educational video!  I have a similar(ish) idea: seen it on a website where you are scrolling from the Sun to Pluto, on a fixed scale... most of the page is empty. I would really love seeing that travel in a 1 hour video also. Because it is extremely difficult to even imagine those vast distances. It would be a great reference to visually showcase how space is just that... mostly space.
Love the format, love the music! I definitely get some 'Tool'-vibes in the Tonian era:)  Maybe '13.8 Billion Years in 1 Hour' next?
Immaculate vibes
mesoarchean music is fire!
nice one! Love the soundtrack
26:20
absolutely perfect for science and history lovers. thank you for this video. I really hope you'll do other videos like this one
LOVED IT HIRE ME
This isn't pure education anymore, this is art. Fantastic job guys. This is work for a legacy.
im gonna watch this while taking mushrooms😉
Wow Good job 😀
This is incredible! Me and my 6 and 8 year olds actually sat through it. It conveys very well how accidental and shrouded in mystery evolution is!  Side note: this video also does a great job conveying the sense of scale of millions vs billions. Now think about (multi)billionaires…. 🤮
Everyone here is praising the Kurzgesagt for animating an entire hour of video, to which I totally agree. But I want all of you to look at another thing too. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first video by channel to be released in 4K UHD. So not just an hour worth of production! This is equivalent to making a 4 hour FHD video. And what this shows us that their workflow has gotten so robust that they can handle 4K now. So I would love to see some upcoming videos made in 4K (HDR would be a cherry on top, although I recognise the fact that not many ppl have access to it.)
Amazing, the music is also well chosen😮😊
Simply amazing🎉, Kurzgesagt... Thank you.
Great educational video @kurzgesagt! I like the idea of uniformly speeding up the time which reminds us how short the period of the multi-cell lifeforms and not to mention the entire history of mankind is when we compare it to the history of the earth.   I wish now a video about the future of the earth. How days and months get slowly longer as the earth rotation slows down and the moon distances itself from the earth. Tectonic dynamics keep changing the surface of the earth and form new continents. As the sun continues consuming it's hydrogen for nuclear fusion, it gets very slowly but gradually lighter, subsequently the earth orbits on a longer trajectory around the sun. Nevertheless the surface temperature of the earth in long-term (over 1 billion years) increases due to the transition of the sun to a big giant, when it starts to fuse the accumulated helium in its core. Eventually, after the sun inflated to over 1000000 times of its initial size it swallows the two inner planets mercury and venus, the surface of the earth is again molten and lifeless ...   That would be also a nice complementary story to the history of earth and I trust @kurzgesagt to make another great story of that.
Are we there yet?
such a paradise, life is thriving, nothing can go wrong, wait whats that boom.   my favorite moment
glad u made this video cuz I'll just send this link to someone who's hypocrite believing in God
I blinked and missed all of human history, what a bummer 😕
How insane would it be to make one of these for traveling to the end of the solar system 😧
Music ruined this,  stopped watching.
Toilet gang ⬇️
यह चलचित्र सही मायनों में सुनहरा है! इसकी जितनी प्रशंसा की जाए, उतनी कम है। आपने बड़े ही सरल भाव से पृथ्वी के सम्पूर्ण इतिहास को मात्र एक घंटे में दिखा दिया। अति उत्तम।
Could you guys do a video on the history of all humanity? I know its a bit different from the regular content but I feel like it would make history so much more interesting for a lot of us.
This would make a sick screensaver
A masterpiece, no words.
And in a blink humans are going to destroy the entire planet! 😪
YES
So if we put 4.5 billion years in 1 hour,humans just existing  less than a minute?
So good that it's trending
at 70:09 there is a sussy baka
I’m gonna watch it till the end, but at this point the viewing turned into sophisticated-solo-rave-fashion-catwalk around my living room  for me. Great music guys. Been a fan side day one 22:57
I got a question. If one million years passed in this video and animation is usually around 25 frames a second what numeric value in fractions of a frame of animation is a human life aged from birth to 80 years old???  A bit of nerd power please here.   A fun perspective of insignificant value
Sick video
Shouldn't it be called Langgesagt?
Sex has been around for 1200 million years and Im still waiting
Humanity probably won't last a million year
Amazing work!
the music for this was SICK 👏🏾👏🏾
This should be mandatory in high school. Together with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.
Amazing!!
Crazy to think that, before the oceans formed, every single drop of it was once a raindrop. And although every drop of water on earth has probably been rain countless times, for a brief moment, each of those raindrops were the first raindrop that water had ever been.
The ending left me spechless! You are amazing, guys! Keep up the good work!
That's so amazing ❤... Y'all are talented as f. Keep shining 🌟
its so goddamm prettyy omg you guys did your very best, thank you for this!
Who said time travel is not possible. Just came from 4.5 billion years ago and back.
Excellent work kurzgesagt team.😍😍❤. Watched the whole thing. Super Job
i’m high ash watching this, watching this the entire time at thru. beta hour of my life i’ve ever spent
I have to be honest, I love this channel but this video was disappointing. I didn't understand the format, it could have been shorten and way more detailed. There is an amazing video on YouTube on the future of the universe... a completely different thing
“A big reproductive improvement for many different reasons”
Huge respect foor this video, it is very entertaining, and it's hard to imagine drawing this entire 1 hour long video
this might be one of the most interesting videos ever
What an amazing video...wow
Please tell me what animating software you use, Mr. Kurzgesagt
This was an absolute joy to watch, I love your work! ❤❤
Watching this reaffirmed my belief in the Biblical version of events.  Perfection by definition can’t happen by accident.
Les goo
We all know it was created by God 6000 years ago.
Would the animating or the research be the most time intensive task?
I knew it was coming - humans being just a millisecond of this big project. We're just little specs, aren't we? This was fun to study with in the background
I fell asleep to this twice haha so soothing
Puts war into perspective
2019!?! Damn 4 years!
How? How did you make me commit to what so early on shows to be a looooot of waiting?
Terrible explanation
It was really interesting! And the animation quality is very good! I especially like the depiction of the moon slowly cooling down in the beginning and the static atmosphere of the night background.   While watching the video, I learned a few new things. The first is that the lava ocean has persisted for nearly 500 million years. It's amazing that it took so long for the Earth to cool down! The second is that the Earth's core was surprisingly formed only 1.4 billion years ago. I thought the Earth's core had been existed since the Earth was born. The last thing is that human history lasts less than a few seconds when the Earth's history is reduced to one hour. I was amazed by the scale of nature, and I think humans should be humble towards nature.   (I'm not good at English, so I used a translator. Please understand if the text is strange. I love Google!😄)
What excellent timing. I just started a module on origin of life at my uni!!
Omg I waited an hour to see the split second of human history hahahahaha
So I'm seriously stoned right now and just saw this on my feed. I now know what to do, until this finishes at least ..........omg..............😅😂
This is really beautiful
Masterpiece ❤
That was amazing experience, I love it ❤ Thank you for all your effort
oooh this will be fun!
I fill amazing thengs you have a good day to all of you
it's very interesting
I love THIS CHANNEL!!! ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Looks like bill wurtz's got a worthy competitor /j
This is now my study music 🎶
WOW, life only realy begat at about 54 minutes in. It really make life seem too short, and puts into perspective how little time we have existed.
I'm not sure why but the end of this video made me tear up pretty heavily.
This is the kind of video I wanna finish a year, watching 🤌
Damn Kurz my squad went all in for this one. Gotta save this one to watch later.
Oh my goodness, this is so high quality!!
absolute insanity hats off seriously
Damn son those early Eoarcheans had some fire music tho
I love this so much! Happy 10 years!
A blessing from the lord
I like how music went from casual calm music at the benninging to nearly doom music in mesoarchean period
That was one of the most amazing videos. Loved watching the moon cooling. Amazing work team.
Amazing video 😊
Congratulations for your hard work… before Dinosaurs you missed frog and other water animals…came much earlier and was so imposing …
I danced so hard to this songs
45:04 jumpscare bruh
The earth is 4.5 Billion years according to scientist not science
History of the entire world I guess
39:52 why is the narrator spitting though
This is art ! Music, animantion, voice over, everything ! Thank you guys !
min 51 I was enyoing the trip
Damn🖤  it was such an amazing video a lot of work must have put through  At 58.13 there was a very minute gitch over all great video guys👏
This is one of the masterpieces of history.
I’ve watched the video many times already. First time I was here for the content. Now I’m just here for the music.
I think it is the second best earth story.❤
Tool band soundtrack for sometimes
Background music should've been something ambient or Interstellar like to feel the epicness. But every bit was worth watching, THANK YOU team for this Diwali gift for Indias ❤
Awesome❤❤
It looks like we live in the most interesting times
This is such amazing work, thank you❤ But you made a big mistake, because now I want 10 hour version of this haha 😄
You could say this is the history of the entire world, I guess
Thank you man i just finished watching the whole video
29:40 You told that the oxygen reacts with methane and forms CO2 and water, but CO2 is a greenhouse gas so..
Watching this while doing an hour of stretching and yoga. What an awesome piece of work.
Truly masterfully done. "Blink and you might miss it" really brings things into perspective.
You are amazing. The efforts to make this video is phenomenal.
Respect for the cameraman
This is truly remarkable. I love you guys for making something like this. Please keep giving us reasons like this to be amazed ❤
I would have loved if yall did the human history part as a series of framesthat rapidly flew foward, where almost none of them would have been visable without pausing/slowing down
This video/project is amazing and spectacular!! Team is extremely talented ❤❤❤
It's amazing to think we were all there in the beginning as different elements and through coincidence we can appreciate it through consciousness today.
1 mistake from 4:50 to 6:02, the moon has quite a lot of large solid dark patches but the earth at the same time is still liquid lava.
❤❤❤❤
49:15 i like how the music beat and the number change happens same time
I’m on acid right now and this was the best thing I’ve ever watched
Cant believe I spent 4.5 billion years just to knit a sweater. And the sleeves aren't even done yet 😢😅
Kurzgesagt, thanks for taking a lot of time to make these awesome educational videos, it's really helped me out. We appreciate it.
Hold on lads, here we go!
WHEN DID MITOCHONDRIA BECAME THE POWERHOUSE OF CELL?
Who else watched the 1 hour non stop because it was soo good 😂
The Crazy thing is that Human History in Earth is blink of an Eye in 1 hour long history. 😮 1:00:42
so exited 1 hour video from kurzgesagt , I haven't stated the first 10 sec yet.
Thank you. I don't comment often. Or ever. But thank you.
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
Like button for currently living souls on Earth ..   .......❤..
Up next: the cosmos' 13.7 billion year history in 3 hours! ...../kidding, sorta. Great video!
this was so cool
And we got this gor free??❤
I’m pretty sure a lot of stuff is looped so it isn’t 1 hr of animation. Still a lot of effort was put in.
Entire history of the world I guess
Thanks!
Sometimes Kurz should assure you that you wont be this high forever
Omg I can feel the cost to create this video
Beautiful
This could definitely be a 2d scroller survival/evolution game
props to the cameraman, who went back in time to record this
19:32 just a bookmark
Kurzgesagt's Masterpiece.
That is truely amaizing! Wow!
This is insaneeeeee…. Thank you so much for this❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is probably the best depiction of human history compared to geological time.
*cutely watches it in a minute*
You are the top. I love Kurzgesagt
I love the choice of music for the Hadean.
Bro if ill play this at a party no one will ever invite me again.
What an amazing video. I'm so glad you didn't slow down time as you got closer to today. Its crazy to think how long everything took to happen while ALL of human history was within the last 2 seconds. It highlights that the fact that over a long enough time period the most "impossible" odds can be defeated.
1 hour took me 4.5,000,000
Thank You Kurzgesagt ❤
Imagine how long it must've taken them to make a 1hour video
Oh dear,  did you see SEA's video about the same thing? I have to say; I never thought I'd live to see the day Kurzgesagt become the cheap knock-off...  jk, I'll 100% be watching this tonight, thanks!
Amazing video. I love the passion behind all of your videos. Thank you for your work
i would like to nominate this video as top 1 of the youtube video 2023
Amazing ❤️
Kurzgezagt outdid themselves . Brilliant.
Every asteroid took few million years to fall down
You've put effort in this
Better than time pass movies ,  if u want to enjoy and learn by a movie its a best choice .
that was excellent
It makes you wonder how short humans have been around on a tiny pebble called earth in this vast universe!!
This video is even more interesting when you pair it with another video of Earth's history but from an outside perspective like Algol's History of the Earth. (If you're a nerd)
The Mesoarchean soundtrack sounds like a Doomslayer ost or a trailer
gigantic thx to you for this video
This should be shown in schools in every continent
Thank you for making this. :)
It blows my mind that the big bang have been past for 2 hours when I click the play
Loved the video, missed the data. Congratulations and happy birthday!
We need these soundtracks on Spotify
Nice
this was such a great watch (typing this from the hellscape that is our proto moon)
This video would be 100 times better if you were talking the entire time instead of half the time. maybe just cut out the other half of the video.
12:39 exactly when the lightning struck I got an ad
8:28 omg the transition from fire to rain was AMAZING 🤯🥳
Ahh, found an amazing video to sleep to :)
Support PalestineSupport GazaSupport the Palestinian resistanceDo not support criminal Israel
HOW DO I SET THIS AS MY WALLPAPER??
This looks like another next turning step in evolution of this life
Brilliant 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Yo
This was incredible, thank you so much for the effort you put into each and every upload.
Boring. When I saw this I thought it was going to be a 1 hour documentary. The kurzgesagt take on the history of the world. Many have done it before, but I was excited to see the kurzgesagt take on it. Instead it's a needlessly drawn out aesthetic/atmospheric piece. Relaxing music while you watch repetative animations and not very much meaningful information. Don't think I'm gonna finish watching it.
This is beyond incredible
earth is 4.5 billion years old,  because Kurzgesagt was there.
this is my safe space
The ending did make me feel things. Salute to 4 years of hard work!!
Technically speaking it took me 4.5 billions years to fall asleep.
Ohhh just what I needed
Thank the team for this!!!!
how can someone hit the dislike button on a masterpiece like this
That music is littt  You could play this as a track list at parties and people would go crazy
But where did the rain come from.
Great video, but I persoonally would've preferred a bit more narration!
I play this as my background music when I work. God damn, so productive for 1h. But yet, so inefficient for 4.5 billions years!
It's been so long since I've studied/watched stuff focused on astronomy/earth science. I loved watching this so, so much! Kind of makes me wanna renew my passion again
I watched the whole video on normal speed. It's insane the time scales... Loved this video, and the idea behind it. Insane! ❤
Bro props to the cameraman for going back 4.5 billion years to record this
i love the music too it is so well done
1 hour of this cool music is also something to be appreciated!
This is future music. Alanis Morrisette might have something to say about that.
Utterly breathtaking. A masterpiece. Congrats on – and thank you for – 10 illuminating, wondrous, awe-inspiring years. Here's to the next decade!
The soundtrack reminds me of Terraria and I LOVE IT!
It's all just a loop 😂😅😂
This is absolutely incredible!!!!  I low key see it being a 24/7 Kurzgesagt Epic Mountain Music Stream with this as the background haha  Speaking of music, the background getting richer with elements as the years go by was a lovely touch.  The scale of time is so insane to fathom... We are vewy tiny hehehe
huge shoutout to my boy, algae Bangiomorpha Pubescens,1190 million years ago for putting us on 💪
Me: plays it at 2x speed and slows it down when he speaks
wow, what a cool animaton
Amazing video, thank you. I did blink and had to rewind to see all of human history...
13:40 Good job if you're still watching, you've witnessed a billion years so far. 😳
i love it kurzgesagt, i might actually manage to remember some of this
damn kurzgesagt should do more of these if they have the time
Ok. Who will be the mad lad that turns this video into a wallpaper in Wallpaper Engine? I'm waiting
although human history is less then a second, but we can kill the earth within milliseconds 🤣
History only goes back like 5000 years and starts at the first written records. Anything before that is called prehistory.
You could leave this movie in the background at a party and it would work. Congratulations on this video, it goes beyond what I had imagined!
a little easter egg i found for me anyways is that the beats of the music seems like 60 BPM or 1 BPS (beat per second) so the music playing in the background is telling you kinda that you just passed 1.5 million years intro he future from the last 1.5 million years, and so on, and so on.
Amazing Video this...
sadly entire human history would not live longer than half second in this video.
Bill Wurtz did it under 20 mins tho 😂
This is one of the greatest, most lovingly created expressions of our common origin I've ever seen. Forever supporting Kurzgesagt ❤️
The earth is only 6000 years old
Yes，the human being is too new to the history of the Earth……but its potential is infinity！
magnificient T_T we are so new, and destroy everything so quickly ...
Very relaxing 😮
God damn Kurzgesagt music goes hard as fuck
Did this episode talk about global warming? 😜. Im only at 1 billion years so far. 🤪
1 minute in and i realize that this is an ai voice
Anyone else get a glitch at 29:43?
who also spotted the glitch
this is crazy. respect to you animators!!
I absolutely had to watch this with my Kurzgesagt hoodie and my lil In A Nutshell birb!!!
Genius!
this would be such a nice screensaver
1 day ago 13k comments 2.1mil views 211k likes
Incredible!!  😮😮  its just insane how long the sections before complex life came into existence are, and how much time is encompassed in those time periods!  Also, the music is extremely well done!  That kept me entertained during the whole thing!  Very well done!
Fine, I'll go play Spore again.
"Nothing can go wrong... Wait what's that... *asteroid bang*". That felt like heartbreak.😢  Thanks Kurzgesagt for helping us emote with the visuals and sound❤
I hope the upload thia master piece on apotify
Wow, you guys are totally crazy. Thank you so much❤
59:40 the way they found a way to change the theme 💀
Brilliant, thank you, it’s been amazing to see you guys grow in such a healthy direction. Would love this on Spotify, instrumental version also, kudos to the all the artists, to all of you!
music in the Mesoarchean era slaps
It’s like they know people watch their videos stoned
For the first time in months I got a good nights sleep listening to this. Thank you more than you can imagine. Also why do almost all YouTube videos have a 10% like to view rate?
I'm on mushrooms. I love you.
Mesoarchean rock music hitting hard>>>>>
It was a interesting video...Happy Diwali 🪔 guys from your Indian friend.
Post one without the talking and just add like a fact icon please
During the beginning stages could the moon have harbored a atmosphere with water on it, it's in the Goldilocks zone, which means it may have had it, but due to it's small size, it didn't have enough gravity to sustain it. This could be why it's a undeniable world today.
AN HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT Yo this gon' be GUD
I'm gonna watch this every day.
It’s so hard to fathom that nothing basically existed all these millions of years. It just was there? Crazy.
I love this and you guys so much that was amazing
Boost
When he said "We are almost home" Its really hit me hard and all of a sudden my tears burst out
what a relaxing watch this was =w= <3
I just had a scary realization. I'm sure this has been thought of before, but if the Devonian period happened 444 million years ago, and there are planets similar to earth that are 400-500 million light years away.... then those planets have a high probability of being as advanced as we are. Based off of this video and the discovery of those planets far away, I am very confident we are not alone, only separated by impossibly long distances.
The fact that an ad pops up right at the end of human history and then it's over is... a poignant, if accidental, way of showing how industry will be our downfall
Great work guys.   Thank you. . 🎉
Wow
It was so good, I watched the whole thing
Meh
How is it that I was able to watch this entire thing without a single ad?
Here's something mindblowing: The video runs at 60 fps, so all of human history (300,000+ years) would be 0.24 seconds. That's about the time it takes for your eyelids to close.  "Don't blink" is an accurate statement.
Kurzgesagt : the ultimate cut
Now do one for the lifespan of the universe. :)
51:20 Didn't a past video about Earth getting knocked off its orbit say that geothermal energy would keep microbes alive for millions of years?
Language has existed for 30ms, written history 4ms and the scientific method <1ms  We are deep into an intelligence explosion
What a refreshing content it is
45:00  Ah, isn't it nice how that turned out?
I made it!
That Rhyacian score goes crazy
Really kind of explains the fermi paradox when you look at this. even if every system had life, what are the odds they'd have methods of communication capatible with us at the same time?
Thank you for an amazing video.
Much hot and comfy
❤️🇧🇷 love from brazil
I love you guys. The passion is contagious
Woooohh 1hour thank you so much !! such effort!
Happy 10th Anniversary! Beautiful video, really loved the ending.
please release a version without music!
Unbelievable guys. This is simply wonderful. Thank you
Maybe this is how the game the floor is lava is created😮
🙂
Mad Terraria vibes on this soundtrack. So good. Incredible work all around by the Kurzgesagt team on this one! Thank you for all the incredibly hard work you put into all these videos!
Someone needs to sync this with the albums Precambrian, Phanerozoic I, and Phanerozoic II by The Ocean.
This is amazing from the animation to the soundtrack selection your team has out done them self's again❤   🎉Congratulations🎉 on 10 years of amazing content wishing the team and everyone involved many more to come.  Thank you for all of the wonderfully dread and education filled videos
Great idea, clever 2D animation and amazing ambiental music. Why not add a dashboard in a corner with epoch's temperatures (C/F) for air and water and maybe a yes/no if the planet was livable by today's standards.
He be playing elevator music while the earth is lava
I just know it's gonna be good when I saw 1 hour
this is great
This is such a unique kind of video and I love it so much. Also the music goes pretty hard.
This is thebgreatest video I've ever seen. Kurzgesagt outdid themselves this time. High level cinema here. Well done guys. It's epic.
i learn more from this channel than in school😅
Sweet vid
nice idea for a game
Just incredible! ❤❤❤
I need this music... can it be bought or downloaded anywhere?
Kurzgesagt, this and you are absolutely brilliant!!!!
Absolutely loved this.  Keep up the great work!
So god didnt make earth 6000 years ago???
please make your designs public after 1-2 years because in devolving countries the products prices seem astronomical
Simply beautiful, I am so proud of this channel and what it has accomplished
Now do the evolution of human history
This was literally all prehistory and no history wtf
Loveeee thissssss so mucchhhhh♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Oops, I blinked! 😅
they CUSTOMED CAPTIONED THIS!?
"번역가 오열"
I fucking love thisvideo....
So good!
It's a film.
Amazing, the best video so far from you guys
A++++++
Honest question, where did the water come from? it was super hot lava with meteor showers then it started raining and that wasn’t really explained.   I’m guessing our water comes a little from the rogue planet, a little from the meteors, and most of our water was formed (and maybe still is forming in a continuous process) within our Earth. Some process that science could prove, but no mind could imagine, it must be seen.
This is just one of the most beautiful video
I love you
Lost me in the first 5 mins 💀
Me with a history exam tomorrow
Folded weeks worth of washing to this! Thanks!
It's hard to believe that Earth used to be a hot hot plain of lava.
Brilliant. Thank you Kurzgesagt for this masterpiece
This is definitely your Magnum Opus, great job!👏
This is beautiful, informative and mind-blowing.
Thank you for such a masterpiece!
Thanks for the vid it is really good
Man I love this. 1 hour of animation and its about of my favourite topics!
The single greatest channel on YouTube
I feel like its a poorly made video. There was plenty of time to explain what went on in the early phases as well.
I like humans being punchline in every video like this
I am crying 😢
The music in this is dope
I feel small and humble
This is the Bohemian Rapsody of Kurzgezagt
The animation is insane
Im sitting at the table 4:33, feels like forever, thinking: “this if fast forwarded right? I wonder how much.” Then “OH YEAH, 1 second is 750 MILLION years?!”  Holy shit… this was like… inconceivably long ago and the format of this video makes this fact slightly more palpable to imagine even though it still remains unimaginable.
What an incredible video guys! Well done, you 4th dimensional beings from Kurzgesagt! PS: After watching the entire journey, the video excels on something so valuable that we often ignore: how little our time has been on this planet. Incredible.
It's awesome and if repeated could use some more narration
As much as I truly do appreciate this video, I feel like there was something missing. I would have really liked to have seen more consistent visualizations of evolving life.  Many times the types of life at various epochs were described, but usually they were not actually shown on screen. It would have been nice to have seen illustrations (even if only scientific best guesses) for the more primitive forms of life as it steadily grew in complexity. Still, great video all around! I watched every second attentively.
Great job Kurzgesagt, you outdone yourself.
Life, uh, finds a way.  - Kurzgesagt 2023
1. The soundtrack is KILLER! 2. So incredibly fascinating and humbling.  3. I have never hit the like and share button harder in my life! 🤩
Bill Wurtz did it in 20 minutes (this video is so cool tho)
Stoner's Paradise ❤ this video is perfect! ❤
The progressive music in it is incredible, my cat and I danced all the way to the end.
Life grow exponential
kurzgesagt, you brought art into science
Better experience if you don't Skip and fast forward .. imagine in every second pass million years
Long time fan, thank you guys for doing what you do!
I really liked the video, watched it during my homework, so relaxing too!
Great work ... that was fantastic .. I'll definitely get something from your shop and send in my donation ... keep up the great work
At about 20:00 I thought Manor was about to start singing hah
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!! THANK YOU  KURZGESAGT!!
beautifully done!
This is CRAZY beautiful!!! Absolutely huge props to everyone who put work into it, thank you so much for bringing it to life!!!
The comments downplaying the animation are insane and truly have never done animation and morion graphics. Not just 10 second loops for a few minutes, lots of details in those few minutes that change. Just the heat effects look like hundreds of hand drawn objects. Thousands of gradients, shapes, effects. Along with the sounds, the actual planning that must have gone into figuring out what every moment should be showing, and the narration tie it well together. Proud to have all my merch and excited to get more
As a musician I want to say that whoever did the soundtrack is an absolute legend! ❤🔥
Wow... we are so new...
I think I'm gonna take a bunch of acid and watch this!!!
I am beyond impressed! What an epic video!
Watch with my 8 years old, amazing!
Same vibe as "history of the entire world, I geuss"
not going to lie this is mind blowing
2 mil views on 1 day god dam bro nice job 👍
Incredible work! i really enjoyed the video, thank you for making such amazing videos :)
Masterpiece.... Once again, you've outdone yourself... And as someone who've been watching, nurturing and cheering on you  since your birth, this indeed is truly  your masterpiece (yet) (kurzgesagt)!!!
The music was great!
❤
Please release a narration free version so I can use it to code ❤
Was about to look in the comments and then I thought “what if there’s spoilers?” And then realised this is literally everything that has already happened on our planet
What exactly caused all the rain after the lava evolution?
just amazing
Masterpiece
It took me a few seconds to realise that this videos is an hour long
History teachers seeing their whole life’s work being condensed into an hour long video
A @kurzgesagt video that is more than an hour long!!!! Are you freakin' kidding me!!!!????!!!!!🤯🤩 You just made Diwali better❤
This is amazing
watched this while I crocheted, loved it
Did I hear a bit of doom slayer in the background music during the Mesoarchean?
Great long play videomentary! I would love to see a human evolution long play.
I am enjoying this on my B&W Px8! Thanks for this.
We got Kurzgesagt: The Movie, before GTA 6
I felt the doki doki in my blood pump as I watched this!
The perfect transition doesn’t exis-
Bro a FOUR YEAR PROJECT HOW in 2019 to 2024
This has to be the longest production ever from Kurzgesagt.  Kudos to everyone for working on this monster!
not to sound greedy, but now i kinda wanna see a timelapse of what will happed to earth in the future. and i don't wanna include potential advancements in human technology. i wanna see what might happen to the earth and the solar system and the galaxy as the eons pass us.  including: death of mars moon, death of saturns rings, sun dying, moon finally leaving earth as we lose it to space, mily way and andromeda merging, etc.
honestly this is a masterpiece so far -- currently at 29:43, but I noticed a small graphical glitch, I think it's from the video itself or some weird Youtube thing since I've replayed this section several times.   But that's to be expected for a 1 hour long animation -- seriously it's amazing, I'm happy to a channel I've watched for years make a masterpiece like this and continue to expand/ grow into fields like Games, Jumpers and so on.   Keep at it!!!
This might be the coolest video you guys have ever done
Amazing work, with the time they put into this they deserve more subs than MrBeast.
Holy shit we’re in for it
I’m not sure if there are words to express what I felt while watching this. It was like the opposite of an existential crisis, I think?  Good. It was good.
What about the boredom encompassed in those 4.5 billion years?
There is no reason for the music to slap so hard. Makes me want to play Subnautica or Metroid lol
This level of perspective makes me wonder where the hell reality even came from, man
I guess this is the _VIDEO OF THE YEAR_ .  Or just one of them with another good videos of the YouTube platform.
Wait: 45:05, what did you say invented sex?
watch the whole thing it was great and i was dancing trough half of it XD
Okay but the music SLAPS. It’s a dance party in HADEAN era 🕺
guide to make a human civilisation
When they tell us we're going to destroy the world through our emissions, just know that we don't have 1st dibs. Cyanobacterias have us beat 2.5 billion years early and made their own mass extinction.   Almost all of the species that have ever walked the earth have died. If we did, we would just be another over eager species that grew too much and altered our environment too heavily that we couldn't live in it anymore. Gone in the blink of an eye just like an astroid impact.
"much hot and comfy"? what
Racist Kuzgurat again here we go.. SUPERCONTINENT COLUMBIA?!?!? Wtf are you Europeans up to with this bs. Wasn’t the first supercontinent called PANGEA?
the meteor disappear in mid air
Huge shoutout to kurzgesagt for having to animate milions of years for us
The fact that all of human existence is just over a second long in this scale really puts it into perspective how fresh our species is compared to Earth.
After 53 minutes (with only 10 minutes left to go) complex life finally emerged. That certainly puts thing in perspective.
Amazing video! Oh how would I love to have a book describing all this in more detail! Kurzgesagt, good idea for a follow up on Immune maybe?😉 Amazing job guys! Awesome video!
Un grand bravo, amazing work you did there. Kurzgesagt is one of the best channels out there.
It’s funny how life has taken so long to evolve and develop, and the newest forms are currently destroying billions of years of development 😢
Wow. Even scrubbing the video back and forth is so satisfying.
Props to Stenian age😏       If you watched it, you know why.
This must be one hell of a watch when tripping.
People who watched till the very end 👇
i cant believe i just sat here for 4.5 billion years watching something that was made by funny birbs
Find a bird in this 😂
I would actually watch this in a cinema. You never seize to amaze kurzgesagt
At this rate He could animate the universe in just 3 hours
I love thiss
Amazing work 🔥🔥
29:43 hamborga
No fast forwarding! Enjoy it as it was meant to be.
If someone had blown on the earth during the hadean period, it probably wouldve cooled down faster
😎
Oh this is SO cool. I am constantly wanting 'thought experiment-y' videos like this to pop up on my feed, i'm so glad this one did.
I like this alot, it's like Kurzgesagt version ofthe Melodysheep video but longer
Best fucking video
This was incredible. One of the best hours I've ever spent
I'd be down to watch one of these on the solar system
This was beautiful
Shout out to the Mesoarchean music.
The c2o update was epic
I love you guys
A TRIUMPH!!
This is really great but it got me thinking. How good this would be if i watch while i high?
The history of the entire world I guess 2
Imagine a wallpaper like this video in like 8 bit color 😢 my desktop would look so beautiful
That was bloody amazing
10 minutes, in and think this is a wonderful presentation! We appreciate the tons of work it must've taken to make this an hour long!
The music was PHENOMENAL in this one!
This is as progressive as it gets ❤
Amazing music.
You are the champions of science communication. Nuanced done sooooo well
I want this as a desktop background for wallpaper engine
Why does the Mesoarchean music go so hard?
“Don’t blink or you’ll miss it.” 😊 humbling
Watched it all in one sitting and loved every second of it!❤
Just... amazing!
The effort you put in these videos, I wish I could donate
I set it in 1.5x and sounds AMAZING
I hope this video gets at least one view per one earth year.
This little maneuver's gonna cost us 4.5 billion years.
This video should win the YouTube video of the Year award!
Play it 2x plus subtitles, you won't miss a thing
A peace of art
It's great timing that this video came out about a week after scientists revealed the theory that there still may be pieces of the planet Theia inside of Earth's mantle. Anyway, amazing job; this is truly a work of art.
the only educational video/channel over an hour id willingly happily watch
53:40 Anomalocaris, my boy! Long live Briney the Brine Shrimp!
This is a great sleep aid
I need to do an event and show this on a projector, with people and bean bags and mushrooms 😉
This is epic
this is amazing! Thank you so much <3<3<3<3<3<3<3 one love
Thank you for this masterpiece👍
Meh, would have preferred the usual 10 minute video. Still watched the whole thing, though
Very good effort, awesome video !! Congratulations ❤
love how he suggested me to do what I planned to do with the video
Kurzgesagt just single handedly fixed our attention spans
This was so darn good.
Next time do it in 30
congrats this is so impressive
It must've taken so long to animate all this. But I'm really impressed by the music, how it fades into a new song each era, and how it fits whats going on.
where is your ad money?
People who spent ten million years typing their comments
Felt something ? Definitly not time !
Amazing work.
Paleoarchean is into deep house music 😎
It is amazing how exponential fast things evolved after the ice age before the Cambrian. I loved it!
If you have a rower, put this on the big screen, turn the volume up, and prepare for the home adventure of a life time.
ALSO ALSO, CAPTIONS.
A banger
Internet has peaked.
The music on this is dope !
Watching this right before sleep. Perfection
How Flatearther FAIL to explain CREATION FLAT EARTH
I would very much like to see the project file(s) for this.
Was the moon tidally locked from day one? I understand some artistic license is necessary for the time lapse (it doesn't rise or set either), but a spinning moon would have been an interesting thing to see since it's not our usual experience.
Why is the landmass with soil in orosirian period but is covered with mountains in calymmian period
Millions of years of heavy rain to form the oceans.... But where did all this water came from in the first place? Nice work tho 😅
scrubbing through the time bar, the ediacaran happens that late?? what in the shit
the fact that most of us including me didn't watch every second of this video shows, how short lived we are in the grand scheme.
Another reminder that my existence is nothing in the face of the vast Cosmos
fuck, bill wurtz got dethroned
Love it! Woops, and 3 million years are gone
Brilliant piece of work, from start to finish. 👍 *(This comment took 9.5 million years to form). 🔥
It's both informative and relaxing. I love it!!!
Loved it, i think I'll watch it a second time
I couldn't avoid watching some billion years in 2x. 😅
man THE MUSIC ‼️‼️‼️‼️ the animation and the soundtrack… the whole experience was stunning!
The level of detail in this video is immense! Kudos to the all the teams/departments involved and their efforts in making this video possible.
man the animation is so awesome! it really was hard to grasp but our existence in this planet is really new. For millions of years animals are using claws, fangs, and a lot of other weapons in the arms race, but suddenly there's an ape that decided it want to use tools and make itself smarter instead.
What a trip!
this is probably the coolest thing on youtube
I love the algorithm
It took more than a billion to actually watch this video right now!
These videos are usually top notch, but this is on another level. Well done!
A wonderful journey through the life on Earth :D
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Props to the cameraman for recording this
Lets take a minute to thank bangiomorpha pubescens
Fullish!❤
You have got to respect the Narrator's masterful "the floor is lava" reference, two minutes in❤😂
29:40 ???
Missed oppurtunity to show all of human history in that last 1 second, it would've been so cool if each frame showed something, like the stone age, bronze age, specific break-throughs like the industrial revolution etc. We would've had to pause the video and go through frame by frame to see us go from the stone age to space age travel in literally a second. That would'vee really put into perspective how fast we've grown in such a short time. The last 2000 years wouldn't even be able to fit in a frame alone, but im sure the people at Kurzgaesagt would've gotten the point across nicely.. real shame it just showed a human and ended though :(
if you guys could upload this with no contextualization and some lofi as a backing music Imma be here forever
A 1 hour kurzgesagt video? Am I dreaming? Absolutely incredible
It happend kurzegesagt has officialy turned into longgesagt
Yooooo that beat drop at 3:45 is firrrre
The music holy
O Universo e o planeta Terra tiveram que esperar 4.5 bilhões de anos para surgir na superfície do planeta a animação do Kurzgesagt. Linda e estupenda. Tenho que esperar pela próxima...
Wholesome content
mammals been around for 70 million years, we are gonna be doomed soon.
respectfully, this video could have been 15 minutes long
This is quite counterintuitive to “Kurzgesagt”.   Amazing.
wowie this message took me 50 million years to type 😮
This is the perfect thing to put on a TV in the background of a social setting
Respect to not only the animators for animating an entire 1 hour video, but also to everyone else who went into the making of this video. It is a masterpiece.
Crazy fr Real. Great work!
"Good job if you're still watching"  Me: Y'all don't understand how much of a special interest Deep Time and the history of earth is to me. Personally it's all Neil DeGrasse Tyson's fault.
That literally took forever! 😊
Thank you for this! Im so gratefull you made this for all of us! Congrats to you all kurzgesagt team❤❤❤!
now way bluds dropped the hardest 1hr video thinking we werent gonna notice
Appreciate this work, thank you 🤘🏽🔥
my jaw absolutely dropped when i saw the time being an HOUR, that is actually incredible, thank you for bringing me and so many people so much joy, this is something id love to share with people i know and they would love it to <3 thank you.
U didn’t know u guys we’re gonna COOK but dam 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Impecable work, as always. Thanks so much for letting us experience the history of Earth in such a unique and immersive way.
Well thank god for the nice music otherwise life on Earth would've been dull AF for 4 billion years.
timestamp for me to remember where i am   50:47
This is much beautiful video I've ever seen. THIS IS THE MASTERPIECE!!!
The video is good but not awesome. Great to get a feeling of "how long" earth history is. But it misses a punch.
The first Kurzgesagt movie 😮
music starting 20:00 was sick
This is ridiculous, this is the most overrated video oat
However, how do we read the name of this YouTube channel 😅😂
Oh, shit! I've blinked and I've missed all of human history.
VAN 15 MIN DEL VIDEO Y TODO LO QUE E VISTO ES DOS DISTINTOS PANORAMAS CRUSANDO LA PANTALLA COMO LAS TELEVISORES DE JIGUETE EN MIS TIEMPOS EN LOS QUE SE VEIA LA MISMA IMAGEN DANDO BUELTAS Y BUELTAS MIENTRAS SONABA UNA CAJITA DE MUSICA MECANICA XF NO XD YA VAN CASI 20 MIN DE ESTA MIERD YO ME VOY PARA OTRO VIDEO!! 🙄😒
Came for the science content, stayed for the arts and the sick beats.
what happened at 29:42
man the music!!!! the music is fire!!
you can really tell a lot of love and attention and time was put into this, this isnt something they just cranked out for money and there is no way the time put into it is worth it financially, we all love you kurzgesagt
I NEED a video loop of the Cretaceous period's music, its so calming.
Amazing
LET IT COOK
You guys are adventurous and ambitious and I always recommend your work.
If you sit through the entire videom you can you really appreciate how short of a time we've been here.
r/praisethecameraman
Is the sun a deadly laser?
incredible how life as we know it is a little more than 1% of earth's entire life, and we can even think we are very early in the galaxy (rare Earth hypothesis). Edit: I meant after the end of dinosaurs, which for us is a very long time of its own
That was not a smooth transition from the Hadeon
This was such an amazing audiovisual experience!
Can this be put in letterboxd, I wanna log this
thank you so much for creating this video! i got a pretty strong ADHD and i acthually watched the entire video without switching video/taking breaks/or even playing in other things, huge fan of your'e vidoes! keep it going!
An hour of earth history, interspersed with facts delivered by my favorite voice? Yes please!
I'm just going to say not having the Ocean Collective do the soundtrack to this was a missed opportunity :D
One touch I’d have added in the Hadean Eon is to have the Moon spinning on its axis.  After the Theia collision, the proto-Moon and Earth were spinning on their axes much faster than they are today.  Over billions of years they slowed each other’s rotation until the Moon was tidally locked to the Earth.
Video of the year right here
Such a great way to give us a sense of scale for the obscene amount of time that is Earth's history. Loved this video!
51:50 am I the pnly one hearing terraria ice biome here?
"Nimbatus, the Space Drone Constructor" vibes
44:53 earth's first ever D-day
Yes...I Am Watching...
The soundtrack is incredible!
So amazing!!  It really keeps things in perspective.  Nothing going in the world today is all that significant when you think of 4.5 billion years of history. We’re just a blip.
Fantastic video. Very zen music accompaniment. I do have a question: Was the choice to show most dinosaurs without feathers borne out of wanting to stick to the common image that the layman has of dinosaurs, because how the feather coverage was unsure, or because the science is still out? Or was there some other reason?
turns out human history is comically short
Watched this with my parents. Might not have been the best first video to show them from your channel, but they still enjoyed it a-lot!
Is that Doom I hear in the Mesoarchean..? 😂
Im really happy i subsscribed
Simply. Epic.
Watched it for the second time now, and still loving it <3
17 mins in and not a single ad. gotta love this channel
I blinked. What did I miss?
While listening to this I was cleaning up my room(a huge mess) and in the middle of it I find a small brown lizard who I think has survived by eating stink bugs and spiders and other insects that showed up in my room
Hypnotizing.
Magnificent. This is your best video and that is really saying something.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI LOVE YOU I WOULD GIVE THIS 2000000 BILLLION VIEWS IF I COULD
This is pretty freaking awesome!
Mesoarchean music goes hard, they dont make it like they used to
In the corner, it says a million years ago.. should that say a billion years ago...?
I'm sorry Kurz posted a ONE HOUR VIDEO?!  IT ISN'T EVEN CHRISTMAS YET
I enjoy seeing all of history of earth in a little over one hour! Also appreciate the background music helps with my studies
Simply magnificent
this was better than a movie
KISSY TO THE LAST BURB
What stopped all the water from evaporating when it was still "extremely hot"? Intense pressure?
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state, Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait... The Earth began to cool, The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools, We built a wall (we built the pyramids), Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery, That all started with the big bang (bang)!
Sorry but this is a shit like Bible is !
thats probably the best video on yt! change my mind.
Hi Team..... I love your videos, content and it's presentation. What software is used...??? .. Ur video presentation is simply superb..!!!!
Wow… just wow
44:59  finally
And no scientific explanation of all this evolution/transformation...is like the Bible: have faith in the video and believe it ! 😂
Someone needs to compile this into a really long image
Honestamente, um dos melhores videos de Kurzgesagt.  The way humans are so easy to miss at the end of the videos makes me think that we are not the first humans around.
From where hundreds of years of continued rain without atmosphere  ?
Youtube: How long is your viewtime per user? Kurzgesagt: EVERTHING!
The crazy thing is that as soon as the temperature got normal on earth life appeared. You would think that something as complicated as life would take another few billion years to form. This makes me hopeful that we find life on another planet where conditions are similar to earth, because it means that life is not so rare and forms spontaneously everywhere. The problem would be for life to survive, as Mars lost all liquid water very fast, Venus got way too hot, etc.
Music is sick <3
Why does the soundtrack for this video sound straight out of Payday 2? Starbreeze, get in this! Also Amazing video!
DJ Kurzgesagt, this beat is sick!!!
I can’t believe I just watched this for free.
Loved this. A fantastic sonic and visual experience. Life started so quickly but took ages to become multicellular. There must be life on other planets. Then it went into overdrive. Then finally we come along and I don’t know if we’re just finding our feet or digging our own graves. I hope it’s the former.
And we can clearly see from these animations....that the earth is indeed flat 👀
If only there was an option to turn down the damn music, as good as at it
Incredible! Thank you so much! ❤
Bill Wurtz did this feat not 6 years ago and in under 20 mins!
I can't believe i had to wait 58 minutes for the Jurassic Park movies! This video is honestly insane. I can't grasp these timelines even after watching.
BRAVO! BRAVA! FANTASTIC!
Absolutely brilliant! Happy anniversary, and thank you.
What a brilliant show. Shows us just how long Earth's history is.
every frame of this would make SUCH a good computer background
Would love a series of these videos. Such as “History of life” or “Human history” in an hour. But of course those would take forever.
Applause 👏
This was a TRIPPP !!!  LONG ONE AND SERIOUS
god, the music slaps!
AMAZING😄
This is my new background chill video
The track for Mesoarchean is incredible! Also would be a fantastic name for a band!
Kurzgesagt has done it again 🔥🔥🔥
This channel is the best
This is the best video ever!!!❤
IMHO, this is the most insane (and best) video you created
Wow. This video was extraordinary. It was incredible to see all the geologic eras seamlessly lined up and simulated in real time. Thank you guys for this. I would love to see more like it. God be with you out there everybody. ✝️ :)
Just watch Bill Wurt's history of the entire world
watching the moon float away is so sad, it really makes you feel the earth losing it's moon
God Of Animations
Amazing work. It would be great to see the making of.
You’re welcome for the animation, only took me 2 hours to make. Very light work for me personally.
Please could you release this as a windows animated wallpaper? :-) Fantastic video btw :-)
55:50 IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT! *middle finger*
4:41 I guess stars in the sky would change their positions dramatically every 1 million years
This is insanely amazing.
I'm impressed! The soundtrack from this video is my new coding music
During the Cryogenian, could microbes simply have went into stasis due to the cold ? Could this example the survival of life ? Or life perished in all but the warmest areas during the Cryogenian period?
1:36 the floor is lava 😂
along with the animation, narration and research involved, id like to appreciate the music designed.. its so fitting for the feeling the video instills in me. i love kurzgesagt and its a channel too good to be true
Do a 5 min all of history of what earth looks like from orbit/moon!
Damn up until now av never sat through an end credits scene
This was more watchable than most feature films
One day this video will have 4.5 billion views
I can't believe I actually watched through an hour - an probably the most amazed and relaxing hour of all
Fantastic choice to keep the music upbeat. It makes everything feel epic even though nothing is happening... Or at least, things are happening very slowly. Haha
Ken Ham is crying about this
Such a good video 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿🔥
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
i dont like this why u do this like that boring??
Love what you guys do. The music in this one was insufferable though.
holy shoot, this is actually incredible :O
They were killing me with that out of time beat up to 11:20. I mean it was like a random attempt of someone who has no rhythm to make sounds for the first time. It sounds like that's continuing so I think I could only watch this if the volume was off and that moot the point so I'm out.
A truly great video, I cant believe why this have not broke the 10% like ratio. Great job ! Kurzesagt Thanks for the video
It's so weird that so much of earth's history is "rocks, and single celled creatures" but as soon as we get multicellular life, everything just really picks up the pace. You barely have time in one era before the next era comes. It just goes supersonic! Especially with humans. The speed at which we have changed the planet, when we haven't even been here that long, it's amazing and horrifying.
Love it!
Ok he is saying 4.5 billion years ago but the thing in the top right says millions. Like am I missing something?
Soundtrack is fire
Not very "kurz" but still a great video
Absolutely superb, congratulations to Kurzgesagt for the effort and dedication and Epic Mountain for the amazing music.
Dude, this is insane. Animating a video of 1 hr might have truly been a collective effort of 4.5 billion seconds of work hour.
Epic video.
Beats watching paint dry 👌🏻
I would like to appreciate there music. it is fantastic
Paleoarchean era goes hard
wow, this was so interesting. And it must of took a lot of work for one hour of animation.
Gosh, the music during the Mesoarchean era is so freaking epic.
there is no way we would have a distinction between humans and animals. if this were true there would be all kinds of morphed creatures roaming around. deeeeezbunked!😆🤣🙃😜😁😑 @53:20 he contradicts himself.
Absolutely banging tunes
Hermoso video, la verdad que me lleno de curiosidad y fascinacion!!
This video already has around 2 million views, which translates into over 200 years of watchtime. Thank you, Kurzgesagt, for all the amazing content that you produce.
educational
ily
This Music is what i used to go dance to. Damn. I wish i could relax with this, but it just keeps me going. Awesome! Do you have a Verison without the talking? Would love to play it at the next PAarty.
i watched the whole thing start to  finish without interruption can i get a like lmao
This was a real treat. Thank you <3
It is amazing how soon life appeared but how late it developped into complex forms.
i am seriously impressed.  the artwork, the music, all the facts, just in general all the HUGE huge work that went into this, truly a masterpiece and worth of holding the title of 10th anniversary video! those 4 years were spent for something out of this world. thank you for bringing this us! :)
This sound track
One of the most beautiful videos ever! Thank you for sharing this, truly awesome!
This is my favourite background music at work now
Great job on such an incredible video
Kurzgesagt you masterpiece. You have made millions fall in love with the wonder of science. Congratulations on 10 years. Thanks for being. 🎉❤
THE MUSIC IS NIIIIIICE
3:07
I'm not sure if this was the longest hour of my life, or the shortest 4.5 billion years of my life
music-wise:   36:58 Statherian 39:38 Calymmian 42:15 Ectasian 44:52 Stenian 47:30 Tonian  those hit different, especially the Tonian
I rememberr that time it rained for 100 million years
Por favor....!! Diganme que este video llegara a kurzgesagt en español...
I just watched this on a heroic dose of shrooms and this was astonishing. I can't even describe how amazed I am by the fact we've only been here for so long.
you guys are amazing
Science and history like this always makes me wonder why people believe in religion.
Why is this an hour long there's so much of the same thing
Around 19:50 I felt like the only thing they fear is me
Amazing! I am gonna share with my friends and family. this is truly worth it.  THANK YOU
This movie beats all movies in theaters right now!!!
What a perspective. 4 billion years and 50+ minutes of video no visible life. Crazy
amazing, any way to get this without the music, and with just the narration and the ambient sounds
I can't wait to see this although I will be imagining that the guy from the entire history of the world I guess is speaking the entire time
And the human era calendar takes up about twelve milliseconds of this video.
at 29:43 it looks like the rocks below the water glitch out for half a second, not sure if it is intentional, or if it's something on my end. Either way, loved the video, and always appreciate the effort you guys put into the content <3
So beautiful. Thank you.
Imagine a world where instead of saying "it's 3.18 pm", you say, "it's 3 Mesoarchean pm"
thank you for making the music sync up with the countdown in the upper right 🙏
First we find out how tiny we are in space, now we find out how tiny we are in time.
God is truly incredible
Really great video. Intelligent life is like an explosion that occurs when a number of conditions are combined. Earth still has around billion years. There is still time for other intelligent life forms. Like racoons ))
29:44
I had a smile throughout the video! Great job to anyone who is involved in this!
Love it. I’m a science teacher and I plan to use this in my class! Thanks so much!
This is some of the finest musical and animated scenes I’ve ever laid my eyes on
But where does god come in?
props for the cameraman for surviving for billions of years
34:55 try at 0.75X speed its soo good
That was such a great gift!! Thank you 😊
It is amazing when compressed like this it almost takes an hour to get to the Cambrian period. Human civilization will only be a couple of seconds. Young earth creationists cannot grasp the age of this planet.
This is insane!!!❤️❤️ Thank you
Who needs an hourglass when this video exists
Stark
Best hour I've ever spent alive
Your channel back in 2021 was the first channel I watched that really killed my christian belief. I finally decided to stop being afraid of evolution and the big bang. I have never been more interested in this stuff before. So thanks :)
The perfect video to fall asleep to every night.
Skip to 53:00 for the introduction of life
Wow this is awesome
This but with the solarsystem next, and then maybe step by step getting at larger scales would be epic
Now what’s next is Immunity The Movie!!! 🙀🦆 imagine working with YouTube Originals to turn the entire book into a movie ⭐️⭐️⭐️
I AM THE ONE WHO SLEEPS
This video is amazing!
Is super nice what you've done. But why not put up a temperature graph with a CO2 graph and some other statistics ? Like O2 concentration and other info-graphics, is is so bland and would have made so much more sense and inform better on the evolution of it all, thanks
Perfect video for procastinating. Thank you! :)
i do really like this video, it shows the scale of the eons well. my biggest problem with it tho is the Hadean eon, its likely that the oceans in there majority drops from the sky by around 4.4 billion years ago. allowing for the ingredients of life to brew and find eachother across the planet by the time of the early archean.
We went from literal hell 1:12     1:00:32 to this
Guys? You gotta give it up for _B.pubescens._ An auspicious day in the history of our biosphere. We unlocked _'getting pretty nasty with each other'._
love the references during the Jurassic period. narrator becomes aware
This was absolutely amazing! How have I  never wondered that human is such a new specie and how short our life really is. Even the dinosaurs are so close to humans in earhs timeline. Thanks for making this masterpiece I truly appreciate your effort into this👏 This comment took me 300 million years to write😂
i have a theory, kurzgesagt has invented time travel, and all this is being recorded by the cameraman who is thinking of what to say on the spot, when he stops talking, hes just leaving the camera there and time traveling to the next spot that he needs to talk
Bro really said Earth - In a Nutshell
Thank you for this incredible masterpiece !
Amazing job
Excellence.
wow this was soooo beautifull, and you all started this in 2019!!!! respect
The Cosmic Calendar - ambient background version
Very cool concept but I wish it had more details. At the very least I wish the final second showed just how terrifyingly fast human progress is. I wish the final frame had been a campfire next to huts next to stone cities next to skyscrapers. It is a shockingly fast transformation of the planet and it accelerates exponentially. An allosaurus vs stegosaurus in the Jurassic would have been cool to see too.
Absolutely stunning soundtrack. The "Floor is Lava" brings Nils Frahm to mind! Incredible video.  Thank you!
kurzgesagt disguising a fire playlist as an educational video... props
Your best video yet.
This was fantastic, thank you!
Amazing work! This is why I'm subscribed to this channel
45:00 Imagine being so horny you invent sex
Too long make it 10 minutes next time
Absolutely amazing job ! Very proud of you and please, never stop posting because its so much fun educating yourself on this channel !
Damn, I blinked
I tried to aleep to this, but the music is annoying. Can you guys do a version with calmer music?
That is an AMAZING video
Nice
Should add some vocal effects and reverb to the narration as a side video, it'd be even more of a banging track 😎
can't believe that all of this happened in just 7 days 😂!
19:55 Does the Mesoarchean Djents?
when the computer didn't show the day and night cycle 365 million times a second, I was very disappointed.
The soundtrack is amazing, congrats for this video! Such a piece of art...
this is a masterpiece
The music is awesome!
I got confortable and enjoy a one hour ride
Someone needs to make this in wallpaper engine
omg I love this
Shit i blinked in the end
1 Hour of Kurzgesagt video was not a dream!
Kurzgesagt: The Motion Picture
Earth is 7528 years old actually. Stop LYING!
Superb  project but  "much hot and comfy" ?? (07:22)
bro this channel is just insane by looking at the title.
just adding numbers
if you are generous and say a human lives for 100 years... 1 life time is every 0.001 seconds. Every second is 10,000 life times
history of the entire world i guess did it better 🥱    i am joking obviously, i am amazed by this animation
AI and fertility crisis will make us go extinct in the next 500 years.
Things like temperature and pressure would bei nice sometimes
The Score🔥🔥🔥
I love the soundtrack in particular for this episode!
let bro cook
Watching it on .25x so that I don't miss anything.
I still have an attention span… I STILL HAVE AN ATTENTION SPAN!
The clouds for like half of earth history are buggy...
Awesome as you maintained the scale of time until the end, I thought you were going to slow it down. But is a video about the earth, not us
The fact that this is free is exploding it’s so good and so loooooooong must have used like 10-20 years to make and test 😅🎉🎉🎉❤But congratulations of this awesome video  😎
1 hour video!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Awesome creation! I love seeing progress simulated like this. I would have liked more explanations on stuff though like how did water get to earth and how did tectonic plates become a thing. Otherwise super cool!
I remember me and my friends watching this happen ahh I mist the good old days
This was absolutely amazing.   Thank you for what you do
Rain for a million years on a lava planet 👀
55:40 Dunkleosteus
Aaaaaaaa....!!!
Loved the music and artwork!
And here it is. we can only wonder how life came to earth
I would like a book on this topic. Earth History. Just like immune.
Kurzgesagt managed to take the trend of '1hr of music for ___' and make it educational.  Amazing work, people
I'd try to watch this with my students but I'm afraid that after a couple of minutes their attention would falter. A pity, really.
❤
Incredible!
This is like Universe Sandbox but in a video.
I appreciate this, and I thank you people at kurzgegeghdgdg for doing research that probably took months, and compile this into a beautiful and probably extremely tiring to make animation.
This is really satisfying as someone who loves to see things in big picture :P
loving the vibe !
Exactly why this is my favorite channel on all of the internet right here
Phenomenal video. Well done. 👍🏾 ❤️
This is project is truly an achievement. You’d be hard pressed to find an organization willing to put something like this together. Props if you watched the whole thing, at normal speed, not in the background!
woooooow ❤
Nice vid, nice music, good explanations. Thanks for this gift.
Thanks
Very beautiful video. Loved it. I especially loved the art and colors in Statherian 37:25.
Definitely one of the best informative animations on youtube
t seems to me that it would be very cool to add in some particularly long periods a story about what is happening on other planets of the solar system at this time, like Venus or Mars. According to the type "... while there was an era of hell on earth, there were already oceans and seas on Mars (maybe)"
Took me a billion years to eat a burrito.
Amazing
This was so satisfying to watch , thanks 👍
vids like this are so beautiful to me like almost enough to move me to tears. i love seeing the timeline of our planet and the universe
The music is amazing!
Great video !
Watching this high. Mesmerizing!
I need the music on vinyl
Absolutely a masterpiece
Absolute madlads, what a freaking job, best channel in YT 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Started in 2019!! Talking about thinking ahead. Thoroughly enjoyed ☄️✨️✨️
kurzgesagt did human dirty, didn't even show all the modern building, WW1 and WW2, space race, and all those revolution stuff lol!!!
wow it took 3 billion years after the hadean to see the moon again.
Camera man is really invincible.
Respect to the cameraman for going back in time to record this
An hour well spent… ❤
This is Absolutely an amazing piece of art and media. We've all seen the scale visually but it's entirely something else to experience it temporarlly. I'll be coming back to this video often
that one goes right into the bookmarks and will be revisited often :D
This is insane!!! How can one study or work while our story unfolds in all it's kurzgesagt's beauty? 😍 ooh this is soooo going loop for months and months to come!👏
This is by far one of the most exciting videos i´ve ever watched. Thanks for this quality of content.
Loved this video! Thanks for all for the work you did here Kurzgesagt! Also.. I have a feeling Thomas Veith or Fabian Glaser might be Tool fans.. ;)
Amazing! Now we need the last 2.6M years in 1 hour video XD
Do the evolution of humanity next!
Watch it 1.5x and dont thank me later
Take me to the Calymmian era it looks beautiful!
Damn this is a project. Amazing :)
Sorry but its boring..
They do fungi things
Video maravilhoso
Amazing work
Humans suck!  If the asteroid hadn't wiped out the dinosaurs, then the Earth would be a truly awesome planet.  Not any more because racists, fascists, Brexshitter and mass-polluting climate changing people have to ruin everything.
Brilliant! Superb work; incredible, beautiful, and interesting. Loved it! 🧡
I would pay good money to watch a live version of this as a concert (with the animation on screen as a backdrop of course)!
I want this on a loop as my desktop wallpaper. Is there a chance you can make it in Wallpaper Engine?
I find great solace in the fact that we invented sex way before we invented war.
What more can I do than comment, like and watch? This is great!
most the history of the earth had some cool music
cool
this is too hard
We need 10 hours version!
44:54 sex invented
That Mesoarchean music goes HARD 🔥🔥🔥
Great video I feel asleep like a god after the creation of the moon and woke around the time life became multicellular .😂 Everything went fast after that!!
Kurzgesagt is the best youtube channel, period. This video makes my point. they've been making this piece of art since 2019, this is CRAZY!
Does every employee from Kurzgesagt get to pick a birb as avatar?
I think that people forget the definition of free. There are still ads, and that costs your time and energy
I like how the entire human history occupies less than a second of an hour, and already there are people in this world doubting our future.
42:03 I saw the basalt pillars in the Ectasian. Subtle but so much attention to details. Now I wonder how much i've missed!!!  Just WOW!!
59:47 can we just appreciate that transition, the smoothest I’ve seen
Watching this while drinking a beer took me about 180m years and it still tasted fine.
I once took a class with this exact title. I still enjoyed it even though it was taught by my least favorite teacher 👍
According to YouTube ads, the best 3d printers arrived in the Statherian, 1758 million years ago 🤯🤯🤪 37:33
I love this so much
Thank you for the continuous hard work, everyone at Kurzgesagt. You're one of the shining examples of both quality and quantity on YouTube, and I can't express my gratitude to you for keeping us humble, open-minded and willing to learn. Please, don't ever stop making your incredible content.
Absolute banger of a soundtrack, that was basically a full album for free... I'd love this on Spotify just to use as background music while working.
Eu um beijo!@ 🎉
Wish this was an animated background tbh, this is absolutely gorgeous
This made me feel so many things. Wonder, Love, Awe inspired. I have been watching you guys since I was 15 year old wanting to be a game developer. Been along for the ride with you and have loved every episode. Congratulations on 10 years of making us love science! You helped me realize my deep love of geology, space, and more. Now I'm working on a Major in Computer Science with a Minor in Geology. Still love my video games! Long Story Short, Thank You! Hope we can have another 10 years!
I guess you could say..    time flies!
Whoever made the music, for this is amazing at what they do, and should absolutely be applauded!
The amount of love I have for this channel can not be understated. You guys are awesome & continue to wow me with every video. Much love to everybody @Kerzgesagt
Beautifully done. Thank you. Really wondered what absolute chaos you were going to give in that final second...
What a concept! You are brilliant guys
Has anyone seen any Easter eggs in this?
This reminds me of the "Scale of a Billion" video. Every single second that goes by our entire civilization could rise from nothing to modern-day dozens of times over as Earth cools and life forms, yet this video is still an hour long.  It really puts into perspective how long Earth has been around compared to everything else.
THANK YOU SO MUCH KURZGESAGT!
I must say that the animation and soundtrack were spectacular. But the script for this video was really lacking. The first 45 minutes could have been absolutely filled with interesting information about what we know and HOW we know information from that long ago. I understand the creative choice of allowing large amount of time between each bullet point of info but it feels like a waste of the viewers time in terms of education.
my first thought when i saw the notification for this was "holy shit get the fucking popcorn"
This video is a masterpiece 😮
❤
Holy shit, the amount of work that went into this in insane. You guys are amazing.
It's amazing how young animals and plants are.
Hmm weird visual glitch occurs at 29:43
Can we get a version where there is no voice over? The voices get a bit distracting while having this on another monitor. And I would like to hear just the music with the effects if that is possible.
Anyone watch this on LSD?
The fireballs/asteroid/meteor took million of years to drop? How slow were they?
This channel would be way better if you actually slowed down the vocabulary and speech a bit. For a lot of users english isn't there first language and for us who's language it is,  It's way too fast for the material that you're covering. I get that it's a video and you want to keep it under like 12 minutes or 10. But I constantly have to re listen to many parts because there is no pause to allow you to really digest the material. It's just too much. Please slooooooow down!!!!
what about a future of the solar system in 1 hour
This video format is marvellous! I love watching documentary-style videos in the background whilst doing a hobby or studying, but sometimes I feel bad for not actively listening to the video. This video has just the right amount of talking and information mixed in with beautiful illustration and music. The last few minutes, with the choir-esque music were truly moving.
This is why I never watch TV anymore. You Tube offers such gems as this. It is a great idea, done perfectly! Thanks so much!
Babe, wake up. Kurzegesagt movie just dropped
at around 57 minutes the joke ...uh... had to be made.
Steve Taylor : "I narrated a hole book so now it's time for the animator to suffer"
crazy
I kept wanting to fast forward, but that somehow seemed disrespectful to my ancestors
Really really loved this one. Great stuff
We're all in the matrix , time is irrelevant.
you are my favourite youtube channel now, no doubt about it!!!!!
Incredible video, inspiring awe about the time scales featured in this one.  And the music, great job !!
Can it run minecraft?
Beautiful :')
But can it blend?
The amount of time this took… outstanding work!
Commenting bc I know this must have taken forever and I appreciate it
Great video. It really makes you appreciate a lot more what's taken for granted and skipped in academic lessons. One mistake I've noticed you keep repeating in all your videos - you use the word "chemical" as a synonym for "chemical substances". It's two entirely different terms. _Chemicals_ are products of industry, manmade substances of known composition, purity and application. _Chemical substances_ are just elementary substances or compounds.
This is ridiculous in the best way possible. Makes me proud to be a patreon, thank you @Kurzgesagt!
44:57 me when sex is invented 🤯🤯
would watch again, had to pause to look up stuff a couple of times
Holy shit
I loved this video, really puts the history of our amazing planet into perspective!
What a brilliant idea for a video!!! Very nice watching it while working!!!
imo this video did not work very well
God I swear I just kept pausing this video to reply to people as If I'm going to miss important information at that exact moment
190899 for the algorithm
A comment of support, thank you for amazing content
They should make variations of this video for different genres of background music:  1. Lofi hip-hop 2. Jazz 3. Classical 4. ... etc  And another one with Alan Watts occasionally filling in the blanks ...
I want all of this music on vinyl, must have!
Wow
this has to be my favorite video from you guys I absolutely love it and congrats on 10 years
It started slow but everything was smooth sailing after the boring billion. It's wonderful to know there's people that boldly work to create art in a time that pressure you to create content. Can't wait for the 10 hours cut, see if I managed to get some of what those pesky monkeys where doing at the end.
Thank you this is truly educational, legendary!!!
WOW, i love it <3
No word of mass extinction of life due to all then toxic oxygen byproduct of new bacteria and the induced ice age?
Wow what a representation. Loved the way all evolutionary information is illustrated. 💯
Please make a version without voice to use everywhere. The music and animation flow beautifully!!!
Mesoarchean album drop when? Holy crap this goes hard.
My toxic trait is thinking I could live in the Mesoarchean era.
Whelp im about to add about 100 views to this over the next month as i have it on in the background of every work station i end up at
Did anyone else catch how every beat of the music was 1 million years?
love the soundtrack!
That was just awesome. I watched everything from start to finish and it was just shocking. Thanks for providing us with this insight and knowledge of the past. Big props to that asteroid though, if you think about it you wouldn't like a T-rex in your yard. Although it would be awesome to ride on one.
i feel like we need a 10 hour version now.
I don’t know if this is possible, but you guys should make a poster of this big long image, I that would be cool as hell 😎
in my humble oppinion this is an art masterpiece
I hope this video does well, because I'd love to see the last 10 minutes stretched over an hour too! Seeing life evolve from the cambrian until today. Incredibly insightful and humbling to see how recent us human beings are. Hopefully we can beat the record of the dinosaurs ;)
The mesoarchen ( 18:36 )music was so🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great animation + Perfectly Fitting soundtrack + Great narration = AMAZING VIDEO
That was amazing. One of the best videos ever. Congratulations.
bangin music
Thank you
wow, we are so new
The crazy thing is, barring any new discoveries, this video will be relevant for millions of years.
Best video ever great for having in the background especially since I love history and space and biology.
You just broke the record of most valuable amazing and longest content available on internet for free. Thanks for all your work kurz
Yeah but you only have hidden complexity by making a second be a million years. You need to make one that each second is like a second in real life
Sometimes I listen to science as ASMR to help me sleep and make me smarter
Would've been sooooo good, but that MUSIC?  Ugh.  UGH. Would've loved to put this on, watch the cool animations and listen to the smart soothing Kurtzgesagt voice whilst chilling on like 3g of shrooms.  I can't POSSIBLY do that with this craptake 2-bit techno bleating away in the background like a sad 1990s robot on ecstasy UGH
Music was not needed natural sounds would have been enough
39:53 this video is awesome... AND I think the editor didn't edit out the sound of somebody spitting 1.5 billion years ago, an easter egg
Super ! ça prendrait la même chose mais cette fois juste pour le dernier million d'année.
I could marvel at the art, the history and research but I think comment section said all that I could. But one thing that pulls it all together to be this wonderful experience is the music. It was all bangers and it felt well cosmic with how good it is. Great work team. I'm just 7 min into the video and I'm all for it
One of the few 1h videos that caught and kept my attention throughout the whole video...
They neglected to mention the great oxygenation event was the first mass extinction.
What a great video! My little brain just isn't wired this way to fully comprehend such big numbers. I can't even imagine 1000 years. Each frame would be something like 21032 years (4543mil \ (3600sec*60fps)). Some events took faster than that. In other hand it was just over 9000 years before even earth was formed. So that would be another 2 hour video for historic time before earth! :)   p.s. Kind of reminds me videos like from author Algol - History of the Earth. Or the same author - History and Future of the Solar System. Would you consider make something like that while adding some commentary? It would be cool! :)
As Earth, i can confirm this is 99% accurate. 1% inaccurate because all this was an animation.
Within the cannon of mind-bending videos Kurzgesagt has produced, this one is the big daddy of them all.
I love the Kurzgesagt team so very much
Amazing, kurzgesagt, simply amazing. I'm not the type of person that comments in videos, but I had to say something this time and help with the engagement. Such an amazing work and we are getting it for free. It's just insane!
Whoever made the music isn't getting paid enough
This needs to come out in VR
Damn, the Mesoarchean period hits hard...
I’m not a big fan of this format, but can appreciate that it took a lot of time and effort.  Looking forward to a return to norm.
Missed out that when Theia hit earth it also brought the banging beats that last for the next 4.5bn years
80% of this video is the Amazing electronic post-rock music in the background. I love  Epic Mountain!!
That BEAT though..... <3
you can take any screenshot of the video and you have an amazing wallpaper, its beautiful,  thank you kurzgesagt for everything.
Okay but how did you guys make it so if I leave the app the video window is still open? I thought that's an exclusive youtube premium thingy?
You're just incredible. Really. A billion thanks.
AMAZING!! ♥
Congrats!!!!🎉🎉
Could you guys please make a vid about lately extint animals?🙏
10 hour version when?  Serious question - can we have a 10 hour version?
Yesterday I wrote an exam in systematics and evolution. This video has once again inspired me in my fascination for life and confirmed that biology teaching is the right profession for me. I can already see myself in the last lesson before the holidays in the classroom with this video in the background and colouring pictures for everyone. Thank you kurzgesagt!
I know this is probably super random, but I'd love to play robot unicorn attack to that music and background. Is it just me? Okay. :( But seriously, this is nice, and I'm only in the Hadean, still.   I like to believe that evolution was a marathon that turned into a sprint with the introduction of multicellularity and the different ways in which life could exist.  And I'm done. That was nice. But also a bummer. Always a bummer being reminded that your favourite prehistoric beasties died off.
4.5 Billion Years and I still have the privillege to live in the same time as all of you s2
If you miss finding easter eggs, there are some glitches in the video you can find instead: 10:37 Meteor disappearing into thin air 29:43 Glitched bottom screen 39:54 'Puhsh!' sound in between sentences Comment if you find some more.
Felt asleep then woke up 2 billion years later
Our planet is truly amazing! I wish we took better care of it...
As a Motion Designer and Animator, the fact that this whole video is continuous 1 hour with seamless transitions, it just makes me wanna bow down to Kurzgesagt. This is probably the longest, continuous, highest quality animation done by an independent YouTube channel.
44:53 Thank you algae
Watching this in its entirety makes me truly love this planet that we call home.
This is a masterpiece and should be studied in schools and made papers about it for good just wow...
1:32 “At this point, the atmosphere is mostly CO2 …” Take that, science-hippies! I told you, higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere isn't unnatural! 1:36 “… and the floor is lava” Take that, dad! I told you, the floor is lava! Feels good to be right.
It’s interesting that, as time goes on, the eras get shorter, just like technological advancements.
I love this!!!
Massive respect for this video  Scientific 10/10 Story telling 10/10 Artistic 10/10
Absolutely amazing work, I'm very impressed by the level of devotion your team has. Been a fan for years and I'm never disappointed with your incredible videos. I bought the calendar twice, and hope to buy more things soon.
1 hour of art and beautiful music. What a masterpiece ❤
Strategically gave a like during the Statherian period. Amazing video, might have it running in the background on a few more occasions
Haven‘t started watching but I know this is gonna be a masterpiece
What an amazing video!
Why only english subtitles😢 this super amazing🎉
The past had some sick beats as background music. I wonder where those went?
Music goes unironically hard
And all of that brought us to: ~Tik Tok~
Earths history to sleep to?
Soundtrack sounds very inspired by Tool. It was amazing!
Damn earth was kinda bad ass in its hay days like a rebellious teen 😂😂😂
For those who want to just hear all the facts. Expand the description & go to the bottom to the transcript. If you click it, it'll bring up a panel where you can click on the text for each time it's voiced over and it'll skip to that point in the video.
These days you'll get cancelled on twitter for extending your tubular arms and doing fungi things. Life was better back then.
You guys do realise that they used a Time Machine to go back, set up some cameras, and used a cartoon filter for this video?
The mankind version of this one will be amazing soecially wit the new Gobekli temple discoveries
What an amazing concept, I've spent the time between periods looking up the cool stuff you talked about on wikipedia.
Comment
Has it really only been 10 years? I feel like I'm watching your videos forever already. Much much thanks to all those amazing videos you brought out over the years. I loved every single one of them! <3
Wow
Can we consider this to be the sequel to "the entire history of the world I guess" ?
That made me so proud to be an earthling
Thank you for making this video! It's jarring to see how long it took life as we know it to form, let alone the fact that we have only been around for a BLINK of that time. This new perspective is amazing, and the music is great!
to see this posted on my 16th birthday is utterly incredible. ive been a fan of this channel for so long now, and im so inspired by you all. the motivation ive gotten by all the incredible content has carried and hopefully will carry me through the rest of high school.  heres to the anniversary of Kurzgesagt!
It's a thing of beauty.
12:12 that is one really long thunderstorm
Thank you. This is amazing. It's videos like this that will help me keep my daughter interested in science. She's dead set on being an astronaut.
And then it all went downhill from there
You’ve just gained a sub
Wonderful
So good
I love this. One thing I know out the human race is while we do have some sense of scale, it is very poor. Love videos that give a taste of what the actual scale of time and events are.
Hello Steve Taylor, I can hear you
Im getting some Wii U vibes from the soundtrack I love it
This video is so accurate, it shows that it takes a billion years between TooL album releases and it's still a banger.
I listened to this while doing my AP Com Sci and English H essay lmao. It actually helped me concentrate 😮🔥
Incredible watch, thanks so much!
ok now wheres the 4.5 billion year long video
Please do another video like this but starting from the presant day to the ultimate destruction of earth.
GOD Almighty created Adam & Eve and everything on earth for their children to love HIM under free will. Save 1 hour!
Kurzgesagt: in the stenian period nothing is going on Also the stenian period: SEX WAS INVENTED
I mean, I didnt think I needed to say wat great videos you folks have been making but dang! Love the music
Learning while  jogging at 4:35 a.m. thanks kurzgesagt! 😊
47:50 life wouldn't be invisible. As the name cyanobacteria suggests, you would be able to see blue green algae in puddles and oceans
This was the perfect thing to get my lazy butt up and doing some laundry and dishes! Fascinating thing to passively watch.
I was waiting for beat to drop
“Hi, you’re on a rock, floating in space.”
I always love ironic timing of ads popping up. I don't think Pizza Hutt or Vrbo existed in the Eoarchean era. 😂
Is there a atmosphere with oxygen already at the Hadeon era? Because I thought meteorites burned from the oxygen in the atmosphere. When was the atmosphere created and have we always had oxygen not just co2? Why do meteorites burn?
❤❤
toook over 4 bilion years to get multycelular life going  im cureous what humans will do in 4 bilion years
wow 🤩🤯
made a burger, rolled a joint, poured a glass, and found this... maybe life aint so bad
Props to the cameraman who ran a livestream for 4.5 billion years, shoutout to OGs
i would just like to mention how much I love the music in here. I love techno and this is so calm, yet making me dance throughout
where did all the water came to form the rain?
Shout out to the algae that invented sex, your the man
Kudos to the cameraman that never died in 4.5 billion years just to record this Timeless work
You could do a second video that's the same idea but starting at the start of life/start of land life and having a slower time dilation rate
Also, I feel that it would have been a bit more engaging to have those significant footnotes, like the crashing of tectonic plates or the forming of cellular organisms, to be displayed (and hopefully animated) while explanations are going on.  Because these footnotes often happen in a time period much shorter than the speed at which time advances in this video, a solution to that would be to remove the current timelapse for a moment, replace it with the estimated period of years this event took place, then when the explanation is over, simply switch back to how much time would have passed during that explanations, as nothing else noteworthy is often happening during these explanations.    If something else noteworthy happens during that initial explanations time, then simply explain that with another animated footnote shortly after, as the years in the corner would explain the time difference.    I realize that this is A LOT more work, and I don't expect it from this video. But, maybe this is a video that y'all could revisit in the future, with these ideas implemented. :]
I cant express the gratitude i feel to get this type of video truly beautiful genuinely tearsd up seeing the birth of our planet❤
I wish you localized your videos and merch. As it is it stays inaccessible to most kids who would benefit from it the most.
i love you Kurzgesagt
This is unbelivable, it must've taken so long
HOW IS THIS FREE 😭 KURZGESAGT THANK YOU ❤❤❤❤❤
nice video
This is crazily cool. Never have this kind of experience before. This is like time machine. Thank you for bringing me back through time.
The mesoarchean music is bumpin
This is the coolest thing on the internet ever
39:53 did he just spit!??!
Wow, 1.5 billion years passed me with my yes wide open. I did not expect I can do this so long😵‍💫
Oh shit, that last second hit hard. I teared up. That's just a whole different perspective; thank you.
Crazy to think that humanity can be seen in just a fraction of a second in this time frame
When Moon is made of Earth, why it doesn't contain water and atmosphere in the same form? Did the Earth's gravity suck all the water vapor and atmosphere from the Moon?
44:53 sex was invented. Let's Goooooo! 🙌
that was amazing O..O even if my brain hurts trying to understand that scale XD
I love this video so much! this is totally my favorite kurzgesagt video ever
Beautiful! Is live to see this for other timeframe, such as life (massive eukaryotic or multicellular) or human history. Heck, I'd take stills with narration and be super happy.
Man. The mesothelioma era was nuts
Great video. Now one like this to explain human history would be great too
You guys have an amazing camerateam
I like how there's an entire geological period dedicated to when a bacteria invented sex
I was expecting to see a Slugma in the Hadean
Very brillant art!
One of the mist eye opening and though proviking videos I have seen on youtube till date. Kudos to Kurzgesagt for making this!
bravo!
1hr Gonna save this on my watch later.
MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥
Swap the timeline for dollars and it also illustrates just how rich the mega rich are!
This is so beautiful. It shows the formation of earth, in, well, a nutshell. It's amazing just how many times life was brought to its knees, but it always bounced back stronger than ever. Life is truly amazing, and beautifully made. Thank you for  making this video, Kurzgesagt.
Love it ! I watched every second, no really, but in fact i watched all of it. 💙💙
I love this. Make this an app you can side scroll through!! Ill buy it in a second (not 1.5 million years)
copper 9
Wow! Great video! I think it's my favorite of all of your videos, though I do have a few notes / suggestions to offer. I apologize in advance for the length of this comment, but I wanted to make sure to get my points across clearly. And I also apologize for any weird phonetic typos, I am using voice typing to dictate this due to a lack of time on my part today and I don't think I'll have time to go through and edit it properly so please forgive any weird typos or non-sequiturs!   I realize that all of these suggestions would have added work to what was already a hugely laborious video for your team to make, and now that it is done it is very unlikely that these suggestions would be incorporated into a revised version of the video, but I'd like the video so much that I wanted to give these notes and hopefully they can be abused in designing future videos. Or if you did revise this video, I think it could be made both more informative and more watchable. The suggestions I have following the two major categories: the narration, and the illustration / animation  I'll start with the narration.  I don't doubt that adding aeration is more work than it might seem, but even with fact checking and other processes required, I imagine that it is *relatively* less work than adding illustration or animation. The narration that was present in the video was excellent, but there was room for a whole lot more of it and I think this would have made the video more watchable because long stretches of it were simply A continuing side Scroll of more or less identical looking Terrain and the narrator was not saying anything even though there are things we know about what was going on at that time that would have been both interesting and relatively non-controversial from a factual standpoint. A couple of examples: when the narrator mentioned the very large asteroid about a third of the way through the video which he said created the largest impact structure on earth, I would have loved to have gotten more info about that. Where is this impact structure? Does it still exist or have we inferred it from indirect consequences? If it does exist where on Earth is it? How big was that asteroid in relation to the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs? All of these would have been very interesting to know and there was plenty of blank space on either side of that comment so you have time to talk about it should you have wanted to. Also it would have been nice to see some evidence of the impact in the illustration instead of just being told that an asteroid impacted but then have no visible effect even though it's the largest asteroid ever. When you later covered the dinosaur asteroid, everything flashed brilliant white for a moment signaling the impact and that made it a more effective piece of information. At other times the narrator was silent for long stretches while things were happening both with life and say for instance the snowball earth. Where it froze over where that empty space could have been used to explain why we think those freezing events occurred and how certain we are about those explanations. I could go on, but I think you get the gist of what I am suggesting that the sparse narration did help communicate the long stretches of basically empty time that the Earth went through, but they did make the video harder to watch as opposed to clicking around on the phone with it in the background. More narration would have made the video more informative and more watchable, which I think would have been positive Improvement  Secondly, the animation and illustration.  The entire video was a slow side scan over either surface terrain or underwater scenery, but at various times such as when discussing the creation of continents or during the previously mentioned asteroid impact or other times when Global conditions were changing I think it would have been helpful to zoom out and see the Earth from space instead of continuing the close up side scan, which while it did change over the course of the video from second to Second it was pretty much unchanging and did not really hold my attention because I can only stare at the same scenery scrolling by for 5 minutes through an effort of will, it is not a natural inclination of mine. I realize that these suggestions would have created a lot of additional work for your animation team and that this video was being worked on in the background because I know that the Cadence of your content releases is highly important to how the algorithm treats your videos and y'all aren't able to risk slowing that came down, but hey it's a video covering 4 billion years, I think a few more months of production, assuming you were team and your business model could afford that additional production, would have made it a stronger video and like I said more informative as well as more watchable.   As it is, I give the video four out of five stars, simply because there are improvements that could have been made, as I've described above, and I think those would have made it to five star video, for me at least. In any case, I loved the video, I think it's my favorite one I've seen from you all so far, and I have enjoyed many of your videos, so please keep up the good work and I hope you can take these suggestions in the constructive spirit in which they are intended. I am absolutely not complaining, thank you for making a great experimental fascinating video that did indeed help me to understand how old the Earth is and how geological time works. Well done!
Did they really have such good music in the past
18:00 *"Now you can eat sunlight"*
Truly amazing. I never felt bore once throughout the whole video, love from pakistan.
MESMERIZING! I can't wait for the 2-hour feature length video in 4.5 billion years!
I would be curious to see the potential shifts and changes that have happened, continuing with a primary planet based perspective, during our Quaternay period.   Like, have things really not changed much on those significant scales of land and species evolution during our age compared to the past?  Like, yes, I get that we are "new" but that doesn't mean that our impact on the Earth hasn't been significant enough to warrant mentions along the planetary time-line... right?
I don't undestand how mamals were made. Can anyone explain pls?
Good one! Congrats on 10 years of Kurzgesagt.
Kids are so lucky to grow up with educational material like this. I probably would've learnt so much more as a kid at school if youtube were as prominent as it is today with channels like Veratasium and Kurzgesagt. Great work guys!
That Stenian intro caught me off guard😂
Alternative name: "chill beats to adapt and evolve to"
Am I just blind or is the track starting at 56:52 not in the Epic Mountain soundtrack release? Thanks for any help.
i almost cried to this video jesus  this was nothing short of a masterpiece, as expected but... this was so special
Beautifully done, as good as the Deep Time Walk - no, better!!
The music is so good man. You should use this soundtrack for future videos❤
Gotta say, this truly is a masterpiece and deserves the praise it's getting. Incredible.
WOW, that was insane! Thank you for really showing us how OLD really is earth
My journey home took 4.5 billion years!  By playing this in background while driving made my forget destination
I never thought there would be a video by kurzgesagt that long.
man you guys are great...Love your videos...love from India
This was magnificent. Can you make one for the history of the universe at the same pace of 1 million years per second? Yes, three hours.  I know I ask a lot, but then again it’s your own fault for giving your audience an exceptional appetite for perspective ❤
A video of Elon Musk spending 1 million dollars/second would take 2,5 days long to finish... we really can't understand the billion concept.
i literally never write comments but this is amazing oh my god the amount of time this probably took is astounding and the fact that this is for free?? THANK YOU KURZGESAGT!!
Excellent, thank you!
Y'all should publish a no-music version too!
Really appreciate your time and effort, you are great 👍
I wonder how long the whole strip would be, that slides past in the video. That would be a nice poster! Edit.: Calculated it: It takes about 12 seconds for a screen to slipe past. in one Hour that makes 300 screens. With my normally sized computer monitor, that makes a strip about 120m long.
Sometimes I think this is all fictional, magical and that's why shouldn't exist... Then... I just become conscious about being conscious and alive... In a sense, We all are made out of magic and grace. 🙏🏻
I love this channel, and I was extremely excited when I see the title of this video. But then I have to say I am a bit disappointed. A good chunk of this video may have been much better with more content and info and whatnots. Especially on Rhyacian - Statherian place, it is very hard to tell what goes on, if there is any difference at all.
Hello, I know you may never see this comment. But I think this would be a dope background for a computer. the whole video!
Perhaps, it would have been nice to add some metrics alongside the age of earth, such as the ocean and athmosphere average temperatures, the distance of the moon 🙂
Good to know sex has been around for about a third of Earth's history!
The most meditative video, thank you.
props to the cameraman filming all this
i have to appreciate the effort put into this
This is AMAZING, never stop making videos!
vibe
Insane
Having watched the whole thing, it, paradoxically, gave me the opposite feeling: that our brief history of 6 million years from our earliest ancestors to 300,000 years as a homo sapiens has it significant place in the whole lifetime of multicellular life, life itself, and Earth as a whole.
Doesn't show thr biggest meter nor the explosion that kills life after the cambrian explosion.
This was a sonically gorgeous journey, thank you all for bringing us all such an amazing passion project!
Wake up babe, new history of the entire world i guess just dropped
Did anyone else get GD stereo madness vibes in the middle?
Brilliant work!
b1ngle
Damn, climate change does exist..
Excellt, brilliant idea. Please, please do the same with human history from 10,000 BC to today.
恭贺10周年！！
I definitely want to see the 3D version of it !!!
A truly unique idea, I watched this with the kids. We loved the music, and it gave everyone a chance to share what they know about the earths history and science. Thanks for sharing
52:40
Has to be one of the best videos on YouTube.  Well done 👏
One hour !!!!!!!!!!! Omg  😊
so for millions of years straight the planet was just bombarded got damn
definitely shows how tiny humanitys.. just a blink of an eye compared to the rest of earths history
if You Had Timelapsed those silent part it would have been 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes 😅
I'm convinced this was an excuse so Kurzgesagt could make an album. Seriously though this is really good and I'm glad that you all are experimenting.
The music needs an update lol
Billions of years ago... life starts on earth. Then humanity appears for a little amount of time. Kurzgesagt works fro 4 years in a video...and it only lasts an hour. But as one can say as humanity history, what wondeful time! <3 Beautiful.
Please one like this with the history of the solar system and/or the universe 🪐✨
Ayy this is awesome!
Thank you for this wonderful video. As a student you've helped me alot,  and I thank you for making me interested in science, and not thinking of it as boring! Funny thing the only subject I excel is science XD(not on physics tho)
i swear this seems like a prank experiment being done and viewers are the test subjects... Next up is a video of how paint drys in an extremely humid environment.
what are we
Nice, now I need a video for each era!!!
Y’all should make a sweater that says “Much Hot and Comfy”
does this soundtrack get uploaded on spotify ?
Visible life starts at 53:52
You should make a series where you spread out later periodes over the span of one hour so you accurately create our timeline with the exponentielly occurens of milestones. Maybe in 10 videos
In my country there is a tutorial trail where they set out to do a much similar visualisation to what you guys did. That trail is 4.5 km long, and each metre is representing 1 million years of time, and at each notable event in time, there is a label at the appropriate distance. They marked out the time frame, where humans have been anywhere near being the dominant species with a ~30 cm long  piece of colourful tape
lovely
An hour long video?!
Quality work like this is why you're my favorite channel.
The animators popped off with this one
Watched the whole thing, beautiful
So the question still exists, what dying planet did we come from?
Massive shout-out to Thomas Veith and Fabian Glaser for the incredible music throughout this video. It normally loses focus on normal videos, but in this one it shined. Fantastic job!!!
I wonder how large the memory card they used to record 4.5 billion years worth of footage. The editing team did a great job fast forwarding the footage and condescending to an hour
The amount of effort put into this video means that likes = views!
I wanted to watch it in background while working.... I'm one hour behind schedule in my work now... mesmerizing video 😱
Okay, we may need to see a 10 hour version of the Hadean section. For science 😅
If you ever needed a soundtrack to play Stellaris to, here it is.
i love the work you guys put out
incredible work as always
If you find this video as beautiful as i do, pay a listen to Nightwish's 'The Greatest Show On Earth'. Written by a man some call our days Mozart, it features incomprehensibly great vocals by Floor Jansen and narration from Richard Dawkins, while being similarly structured to tell the history of life on Earth.
It is marvelous, interested but a little sad at the same time. We are so insignificant in the vast glory of space and even our own planet.
this was great i almost finished my history homework for today while watching
All the hard work that went into this video definitely paid off. Great work!
shoutout to the cameraman for being there since day 1 and capture these moments🫡
Hey youre on a rock floating in space, pretty cool huh?
this was EPIC. What a great video, I can’t believe how new we are as human species. Thank you!
Brooo, thats awesomee ❤🎉
theres a weird glich at around 29:44
Man, Stenian really was the goated era. That's when they started to bust it down sexual style, for the first time XD
damn in this context i am 40 micro secounds old!  O.O
new video genre - eons and chill.
This is incredible. Very calming.  Also on a personal note, im from israel, and am traumatized from the events of october 7th. This is the first time since then I was able to listen to music. I really wish for all mankind to learn to live in peace.
Watching this video was like a meditation experience. I didn't want it to end. Thanks for this incredible work
This is amazing.
I would also like to see a history of all life on earth like this
DOPE music btw 🫶
It was so good, definitely watching this again
Why wasn't the asteroid impact at 33:49 shown, I wanna see it!
What a great video, thank you.
quack 🦆
forget tubular bells, this song takes 4.5 billion years to complete
Clicked for my curiosity, stayed for the music.
I want to compliment Epic Mountain. They always do amazing music, but REALLY knocked it out of the park with this. Each eon is distinct and beautiful, from the interstellar-like back and forths of the early earth, to the exotic marimbas and drums of the dinosaur eras, to the beautiful choir signalling the encroaching world we are familiar with.    Absolutely beautiful
Dinosaurs arent the ancestors of birds, they are birds.. Birds are a thing since the jurassic period.
Orosirian is the jam
Love you guys
First Ads appear 3.8 billion years ago
How much did the production of this video cost?  And how many project hours were spent? A ballpark estimate.
That is so wholesome! Thank you! <3
The part with the dinosaurs was so emotional 😭
This would be a cool screensaver
Props to the camera man for this sick time lapse and the fact that he went into the most dangerous era of earth and came out fine
Beautiful
I thought this was just a compilation of your previous videos. Didn't expect it to be all new content. Props
39:50 Here you can hear him spitted in the middle of reading this line :)
one of the eps to appreciate how good the music is
Great video ❤
well, after watching this the solution to the fermi paradox that we already passed the great filter is not that out of question as it was before the video for me
This is absolutely insane. The beautiful animation and music. But tell me… why am I crying? Why did this video make me so emotional???
This would make for a great live wallpaper
❤❤❤❤❤❤
THE FLOOR IS LAVA
Awesome music by the way!
this one is awesome!
I love you guys. Thank you.
The music didnt have to slap this hard
Wow i love recap like this, i hope you can make another like this again, maybe universe scale.
Every track in the background in this one is a BANGER guys, holy heck.
I LOVE YOU
I want this as my wallpaper
I would love to see an hour long version just for the Phanerozoic Eon, Cambrian to present!
Salute ☺
This is realy how it is when there's no one to talk to. that's sad....NAH I would like the peace and quite😊
Who is the DJ that survived 4 billion years? He's amazing!
Masterpiece. How can we keep you to make more of this?
I need this soundtrack actually
Thanks for the amazing video, music was great.
As always fantastic work. Well thought out amazing music choices and transitions. Thank you for your hard work illustrating this. It could not have been easy
The amount of time and effort it must have taken to animate an HOUR long video as beautifully as this is insane. You guys inspire me more with every video
History of the Entire World I Guess Part Deux
could never do those times scales any real justice. less than one second = 1 million years, that is a thousand years times a thousand, or 10,000 centuries. since 5 or 10,000 bce first human 'civilizations', there have only been 70 -120 centuries, this video is 10,000 in 3/4 of a second.
awesome
"Nuh uh! Cuz Jesus!"
This is just my bookmark, nothing of substance    12:14
This video at 0.5 speed or lower would be a cool dinamic wallpaper
this is gonna be my new wallpaper
Chill Lofi Mix - Beats to Live / Evolve to
I can't like it enough... Thank you so much for this
thank you for turning me into 4 billion year old being
Now that I rewatched the video, I see why that little second that shows a human is so special. The previous scenes show bright colors and happy music, but then the music stops for a second. There is a a tiny second that shows a little shack made out of wood that does not look good. A confused human holding rocks is looking at the camera. This says that humanity is in a very dangerous place, and without much to fall back on. We are also very primitive with our actions. And always confused.  My ela teacher would be proud
this was fantastic. I am going to try to use it for my hour of indoor cycling
undergroung
So oxygen was ultimately a biproduct of the early life? So the oxygen we breathe comes from the farts of ancient life on earth?
i’m no scientists but come on there’s gotta be more to say about each era than a couple sentences worth
wow What a beautiful masterpiece.
i love the fact the timestamp of the video is step up like most graphs that shows the time periods of earths 4.5 billion year journey
Man you didn't need to suggest it for me to study with such background, the music is cool af
경이로 가득차 있다, 지구와 이 영상 모두
This is one of the greatest videos mankind has ever created.
props to Steve Taylor for speaking for millions of years without feeling tired
Truly amazing!
would the initial photosynthesis sea be green and not purple? I thought it was purple first, then green won out somehow...
Thanks kurzgesagt for 10 YEARS of amazing free content
This channel is one of the things that make me feel the most human. I had tears in my eyes by the end of the video knowing I'm an extremely tiny part of all of this unimaginable amount of time. It's amazing being able to experience life.
I aint watchin allat.  God did!☦️
Thank you Kurzgesagt for trying to help people understand the world isn’t here for us
The earth took it’s time to cook, so should you
Everything about the universe blows my mind. Especially when it comes to its' size & distances between things. But also the incomprehensible timescale of things like the formation of a planet. At the scale of this video, humanity is not even a second at the end? Like a fraction of a second. It's unreal.
A hour long animation?????
A wonderful way to understand how immortals see the world. Ten minutes ago there was nothing here, and then some hairless monkeys that weren't there a second ago are trying to open you, and the most amazing thing is that they succeed!
What a cliffhanger ;D
You should have shown the major asteroid impact during the Orosirian.  Also, what caused the first rainfall for hundreds of millions of years - how did it just start raining? What was the atmosphere like to carry such rain-bearing clouds over such a prolonged period of time?  Another mystery is when the oxygen interacted with the methane to produce CO2 & H20 vapor and set off an ice age. These are greenhouse gases usually associated with global warming, so how did it bring about an ice age? Prior to the first oxygen being generated, there was already CO2 in the atmosphere being absorbed by the microbial lifeforms via photosynthesis, so why didn't the presence of that CO2 cause the ice age?
"Cameraman never dies" on another level
Wow. GG Kurzgesagt
That soundtrack… unbelievable!
This is truly a masterpiece!
Slow earth. Coool! I gonna replay it this whole week
This is amazing 👏 you guys outdone yourselves 👏 ❤
This is one of those videos that becomes a checkpoint of YouTube
music in the gap are annoying, and lots of empty spaces without anything.. hard to watch ,, atleast some sound effects.., or fast forwarding would have worked better.. or put make the gaps maximum of 10 or 20 sec
There is not another YouTuber who’s uploads get me so hype, especially when they’re long
The Eoarchean era, also known as the "hot curvy earthy mother gets wet* era.
Imagine if even algae babginomorpha has sex, and you don't.
Incredible achievement indeed!
Amazing 😮
Proof the cameraman never dies💀
Wonderful! And if we started this 2 hours earlier, we truly would have covered ALL of history, from the birth of time.
The music selection in this video is some good shit. Kudos to the sound guy
good
A wonderful video, collection of musical pieces, and collection of information, all rolled into one. I'm so glad to have discovered this channel years ago and been able to enjoy videos like this and all the rest. Keep up the good work
Briliant Artist
This was absolutely awaome
I want to somehow make this into an infinite loop for my computer background
8:16 First cells ?  12:43 Life around hydrothermal vents.  17:49 Stromatolites made by microorganisms.  17:56 Photosynthesis. And so on ;)
The Earth spent a staggering amount of time looking like a dead world when there was single celled lifeforms everywhere in the oceans.  Makes one wonder how many other worlds and moons in our solar system alone only appear to be dead...
@thebibleproject @catholiclofi Can we get a Salvation History version of this? Genesis -> Present
I like the: Life, euh, finds a way. In the Jurassic. By the great Jeff Goldbloom.
Thank you so much Kurzgezagt team for this insane video product, I am also an illustrator, and I can see how much time it takes to complete such a task! bravo!
The music is amazing - as if I was reliving playing a 90s video game.
I never really thought I would be giggling like a schoolgirl at the first puddles, but here I am. Thank you, Kurzgesagt. We appreciate you.  Edit: Names are Hard.
In the final 7 minutes of the video (53:15) we observe events from a whopping 550 million years ago. Although, life has been been around for 4 billion years (17:50), we don't get our first macro sized organisms until this point at the end of the video.  Then, a mere 250 million years after that, dinosaurs...  Technological humans have been around a few thousand years. Science, a few hundred. Yet, we find our species on the brink of self anihilation, and threatening to scar the land worse than the asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs.   What happened?  Are we the next mass extinction event?  I hope not.
Thank you, Kurzgesagt Team.
thank u now i wont fail history
YEEEESSS❤❤❤
I felt asleep in less than 5 minutes yesteday. It's a great video. 😂
I watched the entirety of this video in one sitting and I am amazed. It is truly a masterpiece. Not only a piece of art, but it comes with an optical illusion bonus; my tv started moving to the right when the video stopped.
An awesome video, explaining why religions are fucking dumb, thanks for your great work ❤
How about 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes next time?
Amazing way to start off my birthday xD Thanks for such an amazing video, loving this so much <3
In the Eoarchean era, he says it rains for millions of years and oceans are formed, but where did the rain come from? Now I cant sleep. And I know he said there was signs of water already being there, but not enough to form an ocean.
kurzgesagt really trying to  diversify content now with more experimental videos, and i m all for it
You could make a religion out of this.
53:54 First apex predator spotted.
Damn this is amazing! And it's also great for drumming! Thanks Kurzgesagt!
Just imagine a Sid Meier's Civilization game, but developed by Kurzgesagt
That neoarchean music slapped. Reminded me of terraria.
Not True AT ALL if u really want the truth read the bible
A W E S O M E !!!
Do you have a Spotify link with the audio?
This could be improved by explaining how each era is defined and why.
🫡
This goes hard at 2x speed
Wonderful and effective!
This video is a masterpiece. I understand time from such a larger perspective now because of this.
Please mass produce and sell a solar powered or low wattage motion & sound wall frames at 24x48 that displays this on loop. 5+ years of work needs to be showcased in homes permanently.  YouTube doesn't deserve to be the only place to view this.  Just saying ❤.  SIDE NOTE:  I now wake up and hour earlier each day to do my morning routine with this 🎶   Lastly, flat earthers are going to have a field day with this video now... 😝
Not enough jazz jingles
Waste of time
This episode slaps so hard
Love how around the permian era the "Time" track started to get obvious and more and more prominent. Lovely call back to all the other videos.
Thank you for this.
nnfn
Jesus! Just one second in one hour. It was worth to wait to put the things into perspective
the sun is a deadly lazerrrrrrr
At around 19 minutes it's suddenly meshuggah, very groovy and atmospheric with the droning guitar
wonderful
Came here for a knowledge, stayed here for the music.
wondeful
"Life is starting to eat the sun" has got to be the most brutal way of describing photosynthesis.
*Steve:* "Ninety-million years have passed. We're still in the hell phase. Settle in, this will take a while." *Me:* "Finally, I've practiced my _entire life_ for this."
this is just Bill wurts history of the world but with a higher budget
Kurzgesagt : We need a 4500 million years footage of Earth. Meanwhile cameraman : I can get it bro  dont worry B)
You guys are nuts! This is incredible!
Ahh, it feels nice to experience the second minute of "history of the entire world i guess"  at a slower, more manageable pace
One of the best films I've seen all year!
Demn it's like they watched "history of the entire world i guess" and got frustraited it was so human centric lol
🤯🤯🤯
Music is FIRE!
might be the best kurzgesagt video ever! i vrey enjoyd that LONG expriance!!!!!!
hey guys your music team is fantastic. very nostalgic, thank you.
Anyone from 3719million years ago here?
that soundtrack tho
I love this channel so much
What a wonderful video. Such a great idea on how to convey the immensity of time that passed before even multicellular life appeared for example, or how fast things changed afterwards and how insignificant the time we've been here is.
44:54 nice 😏
I can’t imagine how long this single sidescrolling image would be.
crazy cool video
You can almost taste the passion put into this marvel
57:41 oh hey a dinosaur!
Little depressing to know we are nothing in cosmic timeline, humans lifetimes is insufficient
Epic!
I love how he speaks in sync with the music at 31:20
I was actually expecting a more detailed video considering it's 1 hour long. You could explain why things happen like earth getting hot or why sun is %30 less bright or how the earth's core forming and how that core will effect the earth, eukaryotes appearing and inventing sexual reproduction and why that is so important on life's evolving and why there were mass extinctions and when did eukaryotes started eating each other to evolution of eyes or wings, or how is there eukaryotic life after mass extinctions happened, or why we would not exist if those mass extinctions did not happen. It would also be so nice if you slowed down when humans first appeared and talk about our evolution and development, that would amaze us more to see all the things we did in a short time, like when the fire is discovered or stone age, that would help us understand the timeline of humans and how short it is. That's the information I'm hungry for. The video is still pretty good but I thought this would be the biggest project of kurzgesagt considering the title and video lenght. Hope you touch those consepts in another video. Actually I know you talked about them in your other videos but it would be nice to see in chronological order and more detailed.
THIS IS INSANE. HOLY CRÊPE. I LOVE YOU PEOPLE.
This video is addicting like a video game...
The animation is what i am more appreciating, The fact that even science says they are developing and many things without proof are 50% possibility true.
So sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago. The age of Horny begins!
This is amazing all of this for free too like this is just a masterpiece!
They really took *kurz* gesagt to the next level (Literally)
Every single second in this video an incomprehensible amount of events happened for my existence to ever know I am nothing but beauty is eternal
there is no way life started eoarchean era, i know think that life come outerspace.
Loved the video!  Just... a bit skeptical of your fanciful depiction of the Hadean Eon: earth's oceans were definitely present during this time period, despite the higher temperature, and the atmosphere would've been much too thick to see through.
Uhm actually, life has existed for 26% of the universes existences, so actually... we aren't new... fact checked.
Whoever produced the music for this is obviously a TOOL fan 🔥 A++
Could fill the silent time with interesting facts about earth development and history
54:18 The Ordovician period. Nothing happened here.
„In a nutshell”
Absolutely mesmerizing I couldn't look away the whole time. Thanks so much for all your inspiring work
POV: You're the cameraman.
If everyone who watche this video so far would wait 1 year. We would already have passed more than one second of the video. Good job guys
Almost 2 million views in less than a day! Big up guys. You deserve it!
this is so h
@kurzgesagt how much time did this video take?
54:04 hey look, a tuna sandwich!
Shoutout to whoever made the soundtrack to the entire earths history
I love this ! But you know, that you opened pandoras box. People will demand more of this kind of video.
This has to be the best video you guys have ever done
Damn, this video was awesome. It's amazing how all the life today evolved on what used to be a big ball of lava!
This is nice. But i think it is better to start with like a 5million years/s then slow down over time
This is simply magnificent. Anything is possible when the art and science students get along! 💛
Incredible 😍
What happanes at 2352 (29.44)? Is this a glitch or did something happened so fast it was not noticable?
Well done, it's incredible
Awesome video, great concept, story and animations!
I thought Eukaryogenesis was supposed to have happened in the Orosirian, not the Calymmian, as the video claims.  I'd be curious to see the source for that claim.
brilliant
Such a life taking experience
OMG such a GREAT video this is.. can't believe you made it THAT GOOD.
Someone should make a version of this video that’s actually 4.5 billion years long and is just really slowed down
Incredible concept, you guys show a creativity level beyond compare❤
cameraman never dies
It feels like a crime watching this for free. Thank you so much for your hard work Kurzgesagt
35:16 Me vibing in the orisirian:
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Thank you very much @kurzgesagt . This means a lot. Thank you
love you guys so much <3
Such a great work！
"history of the entire world i guess" extended edition
How many years did your team spent making this
I'd like a full dj set from your sound designers right now pleaseee
Legend is this group of chads who researched, planned, animate, accurately executed a film, and not only that, composed fitting and non-stop music for 4.5B years, only to share it for free and educating people in a fun way.  Please accept my humble 50 million years worth of thank you!
🔥🔥🔥🎉
Wish we could have gotten the info without wasting an hour
Awesome!
Can u guys do more about the immune system plz
Awesome work 🥇
The best evolution video ever, Just mind blowing
i love watching this without ads.
❤ wow ❤ 👌🏿
It really puts into perspective how long the earth has been around
Wow 1 hour long video Great gift for dewali festival❤🎉
The music is sick !
I absolutely loved this video!! I even loved the credits!!  Thank you so much for your hard work!
I think this video is the best adabtesen I saw in my life good job
The music. The rain. The Eoarchean. So calming. I Need 1 Hour of just Eoarchean on loop
Damn, ending is longer than existence of entire humanity.
TLDR: hot mess then colder mess. Later life is here and the BOOM! Now.
WTF 1 hour??? What the fuck was this comp... I don't wanna know..
everyone from poland will know 32:34
Can we just appreciate how awesome the music is
This is the best thing to happen to me
i love the music in the neoarchean era, it makes me wanna dance
Where did all the water come from?
I am not gonna tell anything... Just THANKYOU❤
I just want to say, this is a work of art. It's scientific, and artistic, and I really appreciate the amount of work that went into it.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE INTERNET VIDEO ALREADY!
100 years later people will look back and say: thus is what out ancestors thought the earth looked like 😂😂😂
blud thinks he's history of the entire world i guess
Insane music :D
You should do one but for the entire universe, loved this one!
Enjoy seeing you try out these ideas, so many stagnate in terms of presentation.
Where’s the part about the sun being a deadly laser?
where is "NOOO -- THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER"??
This is just way too high of a feet to accomplish, 1 hour of animating? Sounds completely imaginary to me. Bravo. Keep it up kurzgesagt and remember we'll ALWAYS support you.
I'd imagine this took a ton of effort to animate, but if there is a way to at least semi automate the process, I'd happily watch a 12h or even a 24h no commentary version of this.
Martha, clear my schedule. I have business to attend to
I love this video with every fibre of my being
Am I the only one who read the tittle in his voice?
7:19 interesting linguistic... quirk. A.I. script? TTS? Most curious
18:01 Taste the Sun.
what an incredible video, you've outdone yourselves once again Kurzgesagt!!
cool concept! ive got a hangover i'm just guna sit here and watch the whole thing
Hi i love you guys
I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH. Thank you. Too bad that the accursed youtube ads HAD to break the immersion. But i felt moved by this video. Congrstulations to all who made it this far in video.
This should be posted at the christmas day,best santa gift ever
Congrats! Never cease to amaze us please! Best invention of the Internet : wiki. Second best : kurtzi.
3:49 when the hadean beat drops
I love how the only glimpse into human history is one person scraping a rock against another rock.
can we get one with commentary but no music?
Everytimew kurzgesagt post a video it makes my day
another banger
Kurz gesagt is literally insane
your soundtrack guy just got to go nuts for an hour
Amazing, thank you 🤩 If you like this concept of feeling/experiencing the 4.6 billions of years of our planet and the life, you can look for Deep Time Walks near your location : 4.6 kms to live a story of 4.6 billion years through 20+ stations narrating events and exploring personal relations between one's life and the story 😊
30 hour gang
This is amazing Kurzesagt, but unfortunately you’re a little late Bill Wurtz already did this 6 years ago.
wonderful timeline
I watched a different version of this a few years ago that covered (insert correct time here) to heat death. It still is the scariest thing ive ever seen. Immortality is easily you worst super power.
Why does it feel like you guys are going to stop making videos for some reason?
18:03 THE SUN IS A DEADLY LASER!
i don’t even know what to say
man i can't even grasp the much effort you have to put into animate a whole hour, not even thinking about script and research
Can't believe this is just free in YouTube love you soo much thank you
*PASS THE REMOTE BOYS!* New Kurzgesagt Video just dropped.
man, this is like a magnum opus. an hour of animation AND music that flows seamlessly into each era, absolutely incredible work. definitely gonna be a repeat background watch for me, the neoarchean period music is probably my fave
Metal music starts at 19:42
who got here before it was 24h old 👇
Shows a beautiful oasis world of golden sunlit skies, smooth rock formations jutting from a glistening ocean face. Like something I could only see in a dream.  Also kurzgesagt: "...you would die immediately in this atmosphere"
One of the best educational videos on Youtube, hands down.  This actually should be a legit candidate for a Youtube award or something like that.  I know this was a lot of work, but could you possibly do another video like this for some of the following topics :    "The Future of the Earth (Next 5 billion years)" "The Future of the Universe (From now till the end of time)"
45:00 moral of the story. if you are boored you start making babis
How lucky we are to have such astronomical stability. Some planets around binary star systems  get the shit end of the stick even when in a semi stable goldi locks zone.
bill wurtz has competition
What an achievement, and amazing background music to boot!
I´m lost for Word´s   so niceee
This channel needs to be taught at schools
I love this kind of long content and I hope it will develop in a series of documentaries. I would personally love to see a long documentary with everything about the immune system!
I actually started tearing up near the end of this video
I love the visuals and the music. That’s coming from a guy who studies art and music.🤟
The animation and the background music are amazing. I enjoyed playing thin in the background. Thanks for reminding me not to blink, and yet I missed the entire human history. It is so incredible how new humans are and our history didn't even cover one second in this video.
Find the Jurassic Park reference
I get why people say "just let earth take its course" now
This is so amazing, I loved these videos for so long and to see such a huge project built by so many wonderful people shows that this world is amazing ❤❤
This being #1 on trending warms my heart
This is great! Request for you, it’d be great to slow this down, add more music, make it a background music thing. A lofi beats to earth to sort of video. I’d have it on all the time!
"Don't blink, or you might miss all of human history"   Damn I love this channel
This is great to have in the background while gaming..
this is absolutely amazing! i literally found your channel today. this wasn't my first video but it was posted literally just now. i feel like this channel was made for me. you guys are absolutely fantastic people and congratulations on 10 years omg!!!
People always want to say aloe and come from another solar system, but i hypothesize if they exist, it’d makes more logical sense they’d exist where we already know life has formed once. Our solar system. Who can know what was going on inside Venus or mars atmospheres 100s of millions of years ago- 3 billion years ago.
How many hydrothermal vents were there in the Paleoarchean!?
This is one in a lifetime experience. I'm speechless, incredible. Thanks...
In the span of Earths history, or really, anythings history other than our own, humanity basically doesn't exist, and yet in literally just a couple hundred years we have taken over and polluted the planet to the point of causing a new mass extinction, which may end up killing ourselves off. What a chapter in Earths history that would be, albeit the shortest one to date.
This must have taken so long! The kurzgezast team has my full respect 🫡
The next Rave party is powered by Kurzgesagt :D
Whenever I've tried to read about the history of Earth earlier than the Cambrian explosion, my eyes have always glazed over.  It always feels like an undifferentiated, boring time where nothing especially important was happening.  This video set me straight and changed my mind.  I now find myself excited by, and wanting to learn more about time periods like the Mesoarchean, the Rhyacean, and the Tonian!
:O
Why was I not engaged with the long pauses of dialogue- the animation certainly was a lot of work. However, there needs to be more work put into what’s being said the music’s not that entertaining to listen to for 20 minutes between talking.
Kurzgesagt, 4.5 billion years is quite a long time.
Thank you. That’s it ❤
if you slipped even a minute of hadean then we can't be friends
Oh so its just a looped video that changes slides?
Thanks for making this happen
Bravos ! We haven't missed a single of your videos… we love you
Insane...ly well done. Loved it!
incredible work, thank you!!
Spectacular! Thank you.
i was hoping there was a human evolution included in this video. Sigh. but great work
Props to the band who kept playing through the entirety of earths history.
i love the music!!
okay, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance of humans at the end made me cry for some reason. godspeed.
Awesomely made!
This was an amazing video <3 thank you for your hard work - also the music is a real treat
I just use this as a screen saver on my tv now while just listening to music. This YouTube page has done more for my mental health then even loved ones. ❤
Masterpiece!
This is so fucking good bro
Question at what point was ozone layer created?
People who watched the entire video 👇 also I love the music of the Hadean era and Orosirian
This is absolutely amazing. My favourite video of yours just in terms of the emotion and the vibes! Props to Epic Mountain!
This is awesome!
Someone still wana explain how this big animals just randomly appeared? And all of these fish and insects? Nah, I don’t buy it 😅
Nice video❤❤❤❤
47:56 now I’m convinced that epic mountain was inspired by tool
What's the music around the Cretaceous? Is it still unreleased? The choral part is the best!
Hi
Dang, I fell asleep and missed 3 million years go by.
W video
I like how meteors fall for 10 milion years :)
Nowhere has an adbreak been more jarring!  I say that as a testament to how brilliant this video is.  I understand the need to make money, but the video is so good, i just want to take something :D, and watch this uninterrupted like once a week haha!
It's terrifying that there are millions of people who still claim that some God created the earth and people at the same moment
Could you make a version of this, but with only music and the effects that happen in the video?
44:53 "1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian no that much is going on."  Hm, ok.  "Except, the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex."  ...I'm sorry, say what now? ._.
super fun it was great to play some minecraft watching this in the background...building a world whilst watching a world be created
Badass music and 1 full hour of beautiful visuals, amazing job Kurzgesagt, you deserve millions more subscribers for this gem. X
it's so crazy that Around 90% of human history has gone unrecorded. and when steve taylor don't blink i knew what it means.
One of the best videos on YouTube, period.
hi
Love this video!
19:13 "You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere" is the Kurzgesagt equivalent of "The sun is a deadly laser"
The soundtrack is great, felt like a The Ocean music video at times
I always wanted a video about our history like this. Congratulations on this incredible work.    "this video was absolute cinema" -Scorsese, Martin .
Does anyone else get really ugly gradient banding/posterising in places like 14:00? Is that youtuber's encoder baking it into the video? Really a shame that it ruins the artistry of this video
hadean might have been long and uneventful, but at least it was a bop!
Very cool Kurzgesagt
Took me about 2 billion years to get ready for work today. Checks out 😅
Life don't just sprout like that. Scientist don't have any answer so say it like it is.
Soo cool, but humans will never achieve 1milllion years in history 😂
This video took my breath away, that I need >2 Billions years to get back the oxygen
soundtrack kicks ass
80% of this is just rocks and wasteland. impressive.
truly incredible, an eon in Earth's life is something we arent capable of comprehending in terms of living
1:00:38 bro didn't even reach the left side of the screen. hilarious!
THANK YOU. ❤  I literally cried at the end of Cretaceous. The "life finds a way" and the music just ressonated too heavy on me! 🎉 Cheers to the best channel on YouTube!
I am very relaxed and now I know earth’s history :)
WOW.
The Epic Mountain track for this video doubles down as study music. Win win!
Mostly speculation.
All that work just for us. That is a labour of love.
Another W for Kurzgesagt!
It's truly fascinating how life works and evolves really
Im living in iran and because of my goverment i can not buy anything outside country.i would loooove to support you but im in pain that i cant....
31:26 2222
I managed to watch all 4.5 billion years in an hour because it’s that entertaining.
49:03
Kudos to Epic Mountain, the music makes the video so tranquilizing
This video did indeed make me feel something: an actual sense of belonging. I don't know the last time anything did that for me.  Thank you for this. ❤️
you missed the part where the sun is a deadly lazer
Yes, not much evidence remains of when I played the floor is lava either, though it didn't last as long as the Hadean.
This is absolutely crazy
FUCK   YEA
One day, more than 1.6 Million views. Wow.
Something like this for human history would be amazing too
What an absolute masterpiece this is!
"Life, uuh, finds a way" LOL
A video with 39420000000000x
2:35 The Hadean era is basically that lava planet from Star Fox 64
Bet! Kurzgesagt and co just wanted to animate their lofi playlist.
1 hour long goddamn! gotta loop it
could me make a religion out of that?
amazing
THIS is one reason not to end it all.
Can't even imagine the amount of work your guys have put on it... Just Thank you all for this, really mindblowing! <3
To the person that planned and worked on this idea: 2019 - 2023, JUST for it to finish on the 10th anniversary... That, my guy... Is a passion that you can find again once in 1000 years. You have successfully increased my understanding of planet's history, and my story now will have a complete history. I have so many theories that I can generate base on this video. And yes, the asteroid was a bummer 🥹  To the person that has been talking throughout the video: I'm awarding you with "The Best Educational Voice" certificate. I wonder if young students will love your voice too.
Kurzgesagt, The Movie (2024)
Kurzgesagt in one hour? More like Langgesagt
Fantastic! Watched the whole video and enjoyed it a lot. thank you for your hard work!! shared it as much as I could.
I didn't know they made cool synthwave music 4 billion years ago. Neat!
i had nothing better to do so i watched this in its entirety
This is a true masterpiece. (~Don't~ watch it high)
Bro dropped the longest video and thought we wouldn’t notice
Thank you so much @kurzgesagt . It was really incredible and i cannot imagine the time and effort it would have taken to put this out for free in this world. Your vidoes keep me informed everything about science and knowledge in general and I'm truly grateful for your team
22:55 this breakdown goes so hard 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘*head banging
If you see this comment, I challenge you to try and get through this video on whatever device you’re using without getting distracted with social media or another form of stimulation. Let’s try and appreciate this masterpiece.
Sorry you wasted so long making a video that by default is false. The universe isn't 4.5 billion years old, try more like 10,000 😉
at 29:43 there's a visual bug
I don’t know how I feel about this new Geologic EDM Post Rock genre the kids are into as a whole, but this album is badass.
Remarkably dumb vid
Genuinely amazing! Thank you to the Kurzgesagt team  for doing what you do. It truly is a masterpiece. Your channel never fails to both intrigue and amaze.
I love u <3
all BS
I really like the music
20:41 that guitar riff tho!!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Go Kurzgesagt
Good video to play in background
billwurzt covered all of this in 10mins
This is undoubtedly the single greatest youtube video of all time. Kurzgesagt are the best🙏🏻
Its pointless to have a visualizer going on for 5 minutes and no talking just skip to the next step
This would have bin so much better if my second moniter worked, but the beginning it so bad without it-
Havent the Earth turned purple for a while cuz of retinal?:D
That was a fantastic journey. Thank you, @kurzgesagt for all the work and passion. ❤️
19:31 this sounds like something from doom eternal
The Yarrabubba impact structure in the Australian outback is the oldest known to date.
Nice video, as always. But the highlight is definitely the soundtrack!! I watched it more than once just listen the music
A new version of this with pictures from both the harshet to the comfiest of each era would be gold. Right now we only see the average or the extreme of an era. How about the coolest and the average, and the harshest of Headeon era for example?
I love this channel
Don't mind me, I'm just vibing..   🎵😌🎵
Creationists exploding in 3...2... 😂
Some human at some time had a thought "im gonna dig earth my whole life, and some time later, someone gonna represent it in a cool way".
This is beautiful.
This makes me realize: Everything leading up to now is signifikant and takes as much time as needs to. The millions years of raining are just important as the last 5 minutes contemplating about what to do next.
still going through, but I just wanna say I loved the lo-fi argent metal bit at the mesoarchaean! great job, sound team (for the entire thing!) :3
I"m here for the funkybeats.
Was very good
Amazing work, but it is long and boring. Those silent sections could have been trimmed.
This is pretty crazy
Earth is ancient. We are new. So new.  Aside from the blink, this struck hard.   Thank you so much, @kurzgesagt team. 😭
Great job, nice animation. Easy and simple to follow, very clear voice.
This video is a mountain worth of information in a single hour, I have been watching this channel from age 8, 9 years ago.
Remarkably bad for some huge multi-year project. Almost no info on any of the important events.
Not only is the animation absolutely amazing, but the music is so beautiful and inspiring. I was a little skeptical about putting this video on the background as I do other things, but I ended up loving writing while listening to it. I'll be back. Thank you for everything you do, kurzgesagt!
Since 2019 is insane
Thanks for the amazing video ❤
this was awesome in every aspect! I would love to see a similar video about the human evolution and the rise of our civilisation in say, 30 minutes or so.
No wonder i saw a weird creature making this video thesw past  4.5 billion years.
The grammar in this vid was really off, "are still much hot and comfy", and "these hydrothermal vents were looking at and where hot minerals emerged"
56:00 Our coal´s a waste product from those plants since fungy didn´t invent eating lignin for a few more minutes...
This is amazing
Nice video. I would like to see more videos like this.
This was very low effort
I felt something!
GAH DAMN
Amazing video from all perspectives! ❤ Thank you so much for this huge work!  P.S. How much time did it take to save? 😸
What a wonderful video! I would love to see a video about the mass extinction events
now I download this and make it a looped background for my pc
That is earth from 4.5 billion years ago when Venus and mars are still alive
amazing bro im gonna watch this later cos its too good for right now (:
Increíble video! Felicitaciones por el resultado de tanto trabajo! Saludos desde Argentina!
i love current events
what happended to the narators voice? Something's off..
Hands down,the BEST vedio in this channel ❤❤❤
I mostly don't write comments but 1 hour video, 1 year to create probably, that's some great information I'm about to consume
What a wonder happened for life to became so advanced and complex in this planet, to the point in which we are able to be here, discussing about things that are barely conceivable by our brains.
1:09  How things change when live venus first saw earth barely having any life  ❤❤
Eugh, just take my money Mr. Duck
Glorious, gorgeous, great
if anything els had happened i wouldn`t write this
the landscapes of the archean earth are giving steven universe vibes😌
One of the most emotional videos of our history I have ever seen. Thank you.
29:00 Pls you forgot the great oxigenation event created the ozone layer and made all iron rusty.
wow that's a lot of work and it's truly remarkable
Makes you realize how short your lifespan is
Usually these Kurtzgesagt vids are great but this was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo (one o for each time I skipped 5 seconds) long I just couldn't make it past the halfway mark. Which is a shame because I wanted to learn the content. But I simply refuse to tap tap tap tap to skip random vector art and techno music non stop. 1.5 million years per second is an amazing idea in theory, but in practice it is just incredibly dull. Sorry but that's just my opinion. Looking forward to the condensed version.
This is so amazing! Everything is perfect! The music is amazing, their isn't to much commentary where it lets us relax to it, and it is just so Beautiful! This is the BEST CHANNEL in the History of YouTube!
43:00 Finally all shorter lived uranium isotopes in the core decayed. Just one isotope´s left.
Thank you so much i was so bored today
Brooo im stoned so is it just me or is this fucking crazy? Best video on youtube or just thc?
Nothing: Literally nothing: Bangiomorpha after 3 billion years: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 45:01
Holy shit, an hour long video from Kurzgesagt?!
Thank you so much ❤❤❤
I want to make a script that sets my desktop background to a random frame of this whenever I open my computer. This is gorgeous, every single pixel of it. Good work.
Taking the Kurz out of Kurzgesagt.
This was the best thing I spent an hour of my life watching on this channel, and yet before this I thought that the whole ant series and stuff about pathogens and phages was was my favourite, thanks for spending 4 years making this.
this is incredible i will probably watch it a hundred times over every time i study
shout out to the cameraman
It's crazy how this video is 1 hour long but the human era only lasted 2 seconds. It's also crazy how we have become the most civilized creatures.
45:00 Guys I found the sex update
And the floor is lava!
Wow, thank you
Statherian is the best.
Nice i got 2 version of this movie, Discovery and Kurgesagt
the music on Mesoarchean is insanely good.
Deserves an Oscar
All these epochs looks like levels from a videogame. And I have to say: it's pretty hardcore to start with the lava level!
38:00 ahh the old friend. Day lengh has come down to 20hrs /day, right?
This is one of the best videos I have seen on Youtube so far
Watched the whole video and I really appreciate all the time you guys have put into this project! What as wonderful video about our home - earth <3
This is super awesome! :3
This should be a documentary is crazy you post this on youtube incredible job guys sooooo good
As a student who studies geology and ecology this video is truly a gem!!!!!!!!!
This is an amazing endeavor! Everything about it: the concept, the music, the animations, and the direction, are all executed perfectly.  I feel gratitude watching this, for the effort, the persistence, and the passion seeding this accomplishment. I feel captured by the optimism Kurzesagt expresses for the capabilities of humans and the glorious future awaiting mankind as we advance our understanding of all that came before, all that is now, and all that will be, culminating, hopefully, in a way to exist forever.
+1 for the sound producer
I am gobsmacked that they made this. Wow, just wow.
pity that massive events like the first extinction are just glossed over. otherwise awesome
That was amazing
This video gives such a strange sense of self-reflection. It's like life is grateful unto itself. It's meta-consciousness. I can't help but feel nostalgic. I am so personally grateful that life can exist in this universe. The ability to experience is so profound because it intersects the boundary between life and the world around us. It seems impossible, yet here we are. I hope everyone realizes that they are special. We beat all the odds. Cause and effect for billions of years led to you and I, and I find that shit amazing to the core.
This is a damn great idea
32:00 somewhere around here the first shorter lived radioactive isotopes in the core´ve depleted.
Impressive, amazing job!!
this is my 3rd comment  in   10 years of youtube, but with this video  i think  you really deserve some feedback.  i love  your channel, keep up  the best work this site has ever seen!
History of the world, I guess 2: electric boogaloo
سبحان الله
The closest attempt on Youtube that does justice to 4.5 billion years of Earth.
This is sooo cool video and help much
Imagine the ignorance of people who dislike masterpieces like this one
Funnily enough some still prefere the old man builds `uge ship and escapes the wrath of his invisible friend just to repopulate the earth in an incestuous gang bang... depite all *this* .
I love this so much
DAMN. I can't imagine how much time would this have took to create, hats off Kurzgesagt.
Thank you.
"Life uh.. finds a way"
this was such an incredbble jurney
At least now we know what being next to a black hole is like, watching the eons pass in the amount of time is takes to watch a Youtube video.
One Hour Kurzgesagt video. This is the best thing that happened to November so far. I enjoyed every second of it. Thank you for the ride
I watched the whe thing without skipping anything
This video is truly amazing, as everyone is saying, but I'd like to specifically point out the 1-hour-long soundtrack that does a exceptionally great job at accompanying the entire video, while keeping a theme throughout yet never boring! Congratulation for this which must've truly been an incredible amount of work :D
what the hell. an hour?!?!? this is amazing!
Other species came way earlier than human species but why only humans became so advanced in evolution?
hi you're on a rock floating in space
I love how people are commenting on how much time this took to make when 90% of it is looping backgrounds.
Can y’all please shut up and talk about the video instead of saying” omg this prob took so long to do and we are watching it for free omg I love you kurzgezact😊😊”
This is how you show All of History 'In a Nutshell'.... Hats off to your team for making this... Oh my god the time it must have taken you guys to make this... I really don't have words to describe it... ❤
Diwali gift for Indian 🇮🇳❤️🥺
Props to the camaraman for having such great pulse for 4.5 billion years
Sensacional!
This is crazy
Magnificent, all those years of work were worth it
What a long way to where we are now
i legit gave myself the challenge to watch all of this without skipping. granted, there were tedious parts, but it has been a wild ride and absolutely worthwhile. thank you for this masterpiece!
"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of GOD, have mercy on me, a sinner"  Please pray these words now 🙏 and please consider beginnning daily prayer, it is a good habit that will help you if you actually do it and continue to do it  Matthew 5:9 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of GOD" 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Who else thought that the music in the background was quite banger?
Earth lore:
Thanks, this was a pretty impressive piece of Artwork & Scientific Education.  I can quibble you left off a few important milestones in the voice over, but as an introductory primer,, it was excellent.
Those Bangiomorpha algae must have been very horny.
Kurzgesagt. This is Amazing and Much effort to make this video , This would take time to make this video For free we would appreciate this, and Keep making this videos to educate more people to history.
Every moment, hospitals in Palestine are bombed, and children, women, the elderly, mothers and fathers die.... Where are human rights, where are animal rights, where are women’s rights, where are children’s rights, where are the rights of the elderly, where are plant rights, where are the rights of the patient, where is justice, where is mercy, where is love, where is goodness, where is peace. Help Palestine. Help the Arabs, research their history and religion. They love peace and goodness for all people, but unfortunately today they are killed in cold blood and their lands are stolen.
This is fantastic!  ... Now we just need a two-hour 'universe before earth' video and we'll have a feature-length journey through time! :D
I've watched every second of it
Play this at .5x speed to really feeeeeeel it lol  Don’t cheat and play it at 2X speed lol
What did just happen??? That's crazy.....thank you guys so much!!!!
Vim pelo @inutilismo
Incredible
What an amazing video, thank you for it
Dangit I blinked, now I have to start over
while the narrator just tops narrating i'm over here touching my headset and feeling it like a DJ coz this music is fire!
It was lovely indeed, i could have done without the music (or at a lower volume, but this is a complaint of mine for many online videos)
Life went by in the blink of an eye, just like the video. Thanks for the amazing video <3
22:21 , 43:14 😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥
*59.9 minutes of earth histroy*   That one dude: "oh hey-"
I have to donate cause this is AMAZING!   Getting a new tv just to watch this 😂
Jurassic park reference in the Jurassic era XD
Not to talk you guys down, but there's a guy who did this video in under 20 minutes and its very popular. History of the entire world i guess
👏👏👏
remember history of the earth i guess ?, i miss that video
I waited 58:13 for that line. Bravo.
A TOOL fan definitely made this music. Especially tonian
Nah kurzgesagt you're truly tweaking. An 1-hour long fully animated movie FOR FREE? You guys are unbelievable. Absolutely amazing and incredible. Massive respect to you!
it took me 113billion years to find this video
Ох спасибо ребята. Это было круто...
Dont mind me commenting to improve analytics
press like, if you watched it without scrolling!
Feels good knowing this channel exists
The greatest video ever! So informative and clever.
Damn the vanced skip filler button be hitting different on this
the music paired with the visuals is absolute perfection.
this was boring as fuck
Amazing video, the ending what exactly what i was expecting. Great job
A bit early for Christmas present don't you think Kurz?
"An asteroid hit the earth and killed all the dinosaurs...such a bummer" 😂😂😂😂
29:42 anyone else notice that?
this is so cool
I have watched this video 2 times
Bill Wurtz eat your heart out
just listening to the video was eartherly satisfying
I would absolutely love some kind of screensaver / wallpaper version of this, I'd buy it immediately. Edit: While the visuals are absolutely stunning, I just wanted to add that the sounddesign is amazing too!
To all of you at Kurzgesagt: I love you! Thanks!!!!!🧡
Can’t wait for the slavery arc
All of BS
Credits to the camera man for  filming this in the kurzgesagt universe
*Excellent* and coherent music! But could there be a version with the sound effects and narration, but less or no music? It would be easier to have on in the background
29:42 lil bit of glitching there
Thanks!
this techno is good
Damn, Kurzgesagt meets Melody Sheep
let me grab huge ass bag of popcorn, this is gonna be insane
Now we need a history of the humanity
What a great concept. Beautiful art and music and fascinating facts about earth's history. A great reminder of how deep deep time is.   I only wish for more narration, though i know that wasn't the point... I just want to know more about each era. Could we have visited the Mesoarcaean,  or would it have been too hot or cold? Would there be enough air to breathe? Would the atmosphere have protected us from the sun's radiation? This could have been a dense hour worth of detail and I would have been perfectly happy. 😂
this is just a masterpiece
This feels like an hour long Tool song intro in multiple ways
5:50 is that a Dollar General ?
this earth looks pretty flat if you ask me
1:36 The floor is lava!!!
You could make a religion out of this
this is legendary
Increible!❤
I was casually watching this while eating breakfast so I didnt pay attention to the first few minutes then I felt something is wrong, the video was not ending even after watching 25 minutes. I look d up the duration and Holy Smoke 😮. Thank you Kurzgesagt
One of the Best materials on this channel
came for Kurzgesagt, stayed for techno
The first ten minutes so far have reminded me of being at the club Stadium in Jakarta... IYKYK
Really cool video. Watched it all through, really puts the time into perspective!
Really puts into perspective the vastness of our universes history that we are only a tiny part of. Fascinating to say the least.
What caused the mass freeze in the cryogenian?
Just want to send a shout out to whoever composed the music on this. Absolute banger stuff
really liked the concept
Holy Jesus! The last minuts made me emotional 😢
Holy shit, never been more proud of Earth.
The score to this animation fits perfectly to each era based on what was happening at the time, for example - a ‘western slight style guitar’ on Rhyacian 33:33 . Brilliant programme music telling a story all on its own
you know kurzgesagt really love their viewers, they made a 1 hour video animation❤
You didn't mention god for some reason?
I love the soundtrack! Reminds me of Volkor X in the beginning!
“If you’re still watching…” What? I could watch this over and over again!
really wish kurzgesagt collabed with guerilla game's' horizon series.. like they did when cyberpunk 2077 came out
I just decided to watch this for fun man this probably took years to animate and they did this for us man keep the good work
this video is a movie and i love it
I am 10 billion percent sure this is the best if not The BEST video made by Kurzgesagt ❤‍🔥
Insane! This must have been a project from last year
I know this is not a history channel, but could you PLEASE do one for human history?
this is such a vibe, I'll call this, educational rave. A new genre is born
I have been a huge fan of your channel for years and yet you blew my mind again with this amazing video.  I love the culture of Kurzgesagt, the passion and dedication to spread knowledge, across the world. I hope this channel keeps growing and growing because you guys deserve it!!  It would be also nice to open your Munich based studio to visitors!😊 I would be amazed to see it and to get to know even more about your work.
This is amazing
There’s a giant hole in earth history
100% the best video ive watched this year, music, visuals and an amazing way to package all that information! KEEP IT UP KURZGESAGT!!!
YouTube made me wait 5 million years to skip the ad
GOAT
This was amazing! The quality, the animation, sound effects, everything was so amazing! Congratulations on this amazing video, I love it!
this is a great video. I really liked it
Wow
Hopefully this will be sientifically right
Yesterday, I felt so old. Today, I feel so young.
HOLY SHITE a 1hr kurzgesagt video
1:36 MR BEAST JOINED THE CHAT :D
Merci pour toutes vos vidéos, franchement c'est le résultat d'un travail dur, et elles en valent la peine ! Les musiques sont incroyables, elles collent bien aux vidéos :)
Why did it start raining tho? and for so long as well. Where did all this rain/water came from 🤔
You really outdid yourselves with this one, amazing art as always, amazing concept and an epic music album on top of all this!
Human be like 👁️👄👁️
Times like this I'm glad I have 2 monitors.
A simillar video about a history of the universe would be awesome.
Holy shit this took 5 years??? I am lost for words
I need this as a screensaver / background
Well worth the wait!
Utterly incredible. Thanks for existing, Kurzgesagt.
Man i love science, it's so epic, this channel is a big reason why i decided to study to enter medicine, now i'm 4th year in the uni and i keep watching. love it
Thank you so, so much, dear devs and creators at Kurzgesagt!! This one's a treat!
waching this while making essay
My new favorite video of all time. Thank you so very much for this.
I love the Hadean, Eoarchean, and Mesoarchean segments. They had great visuals and music. I'm just wondering why the appearance of multicellular life was never announced, or the appearance of flowers, insects, and a few others.
Just added this into my watch list. Can't wait to watch this 😃So excited!
The music is a bop
This is better than some earth documentaries
No that I’ve watched this awake, this will be my go to for falling asleep. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
I was feeling depressed and I watched this 3 hours straight on repeat.
Love the sound track.
I would love a version without music! It could be relaxing to have only foley and sound effects, as if you were an eternal being watching as million years go by as seconds
Mesoarchean music goes hard
One hours of animation, 5 mins of talking, what a waste of a, what could have been very imfomative video. It was pretty much that was about it.
This was such an amazing experience. There are many opportunities for thought as the impossible stretches of time fly by. This really shows the grand scale of life and the struggle that life as a while has endured.
🎉
Yo, shoutout to the guy who composed the music ❤
Love you guyz for making this.
Early earth didn't even have wi-fi, that's crazy
Humanity has the "honor" of causing the sixth(?) global mass extinction event. What a shame..
4500 million years to build an habitable planet, only 100 years to ruin it, good job mankind! 👌
So you made an hour long video of what ''scientists'' think happened.
Really love the animation though I would've loved a lot more explanation as in what gases the microbes in the mesoarchaen emitted. What were their necessities and maybe also potential link to the RNA world?
진짜 영상길이 미쳤다 댑악이네 ㄷㄷ
cool! now in real time please :)
Anyone else really getting a feeling to play Spore again?... Really great video, good music too! :D
We are meanigless in universe size, but we are made of 14 billions years of evolution, since big bomb
Amazing Work!
Hooooooly, this video was insane ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm a bit surprised that the creation of this video didn't have a section in this timelapse
Huge shoutout to the cameraman for recording the last 4.5 billion years
Impressive
11:34 this is just so relaxing
Why are you posting this on YouTube? Sell it as a film! I'd buy it
staring into the void
Finnaly the earth lore has been explained
I find this video emotional and cried at the end when he said "Dnt blink your eyes or else you will miss out on humen". Such a masterpiece. Thanks for every second of this video.
And here I am hurting myself for some unrequited love, where love is everywhere you just need to be patient and continues to explore. What a video. Thank you so much.
Ok KZ always impresses me, this is no exception. However, the soundtrack is STRIKINGLY  AWESOME. Thanks for all your effort!
what does it mean life begins enter the stage? it existed somwhere in space and just entered earth when it bacame suitable?
This is so well done, even just scrolling through it is satisfying, seeing how things change
Nicely made, but some earthquakes during the continents forming era would be a good addition.
Video of the year 👏👏👏 hand down
Thank you for all the hard word you and your team did in making this.
🌍❤
what's the point of all our sufferin, when we're barely an insignificant sneeze in the history of existence?
This was an amazing experience!!! Thank you so much and congrats on your 10th anniversary🎉🎉🎉
Thanks for making this brilliant project.
Loved this
Congratulations on this perfectly amazing video and thank you so much for making it for us. Congrats for not only the spectacular animation but also for the whole experience concept and the absolute 1h banger of a soundtrack that I will most likely listen to again and again. Thank you and stay awesome
Is it just me or does Mick Gordon take over the music in at 19:40 ?
Deep time is both amazing, and terrifying at the same time. To fit 4.5 billion years into one hour, 1.5 million years had to be squeezed into each second. Yet 4.5 billion years is a blink in the possible eternity that lay ahead of us.  New stars may continue to be formed for another 100 trillion years. If we continue this same experiment, and compress the Earth's 4.5 billion years, into a single second, it would take a little over six hours to reach 100 trillion.  Think about that. A single minute would contain 270 billion years. That's 1000 times longer than the amount of time the dinosaurs reigned, in a single second, yet it would take over six hours to get to the point that the creation of stars wound down.  Played out at the same 1.5 million years a second, you would need to strap yourself in, and watch a video over 2.5 years in length.  Even this unfathomable amount of time is itself a blink in the amount of time left before all the remaining stars, long since turned into white dwarfs, and slowly cooled to the point they no longer shine, turn to iron. If that is indeed the fate of all things.   Like I said, amazing, and terrifying.
Best utilisation of 60 minutes of my life❤
Truly a master work of art! I watched every second just to admire the hard work you and life has given us.
Can you do one without music?
What a monstrous mountain of work it took to produce this video. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Why is the music SO GOOD I swear
Best work I had ever seen yet, thank you so much guys. It was soo beautiful ❤😍
This would make the best desktop wallpaper in the history of our planet
If you could elaborate just how big 1.5 million years is.. naah... Just nit picking... Absolutely great video... Loved every million years of it ..
There was a mass extension. 1 second passes, everything back to normal :D
Ah, finally a Langgesagt video!
45:15 the first sex in the history of earth
Print this to film and send it into space - show anyone out there our understanding of how we came to be 👾
I loved this! It’s a true work of art: the visuals, the music! I think this may be my new thing to put on at parties
Bill Wurtz did it better in 19 minutes
Love the video, but whats with the invent instead of evolve. Am i to stupid or os this simulation theory stuff ?
The cameraman truly never dies
so long!                               (thats what she said)
fixing the attention span with this one🔊🔊🔥🔥🔥
It feels illegal that I can enjoy this masterwork for free
I am a normal human. When I see a Kurzgesagt video, I click it.
I am comforted that AI wrote the music and now feel snoozy and will go to bed knowing the future is in safe hands. PS 2.8 BYO is my groove, take note algo gods
life peaked at 45:00
The Mega Kurzgesagt video
Sublime
I guess you could say this was a...  *life fulfilled* journey
Absolutely amazing work I will watch this many many times over 😊 this is such wonderful way to experience the planet we live on. ❤❤❤❤
I desperately need a 10-hour-long version of this
the music is so good
This video should be renamed "my grandpa's path to school when he was younger"
This specific video is so amazing that this should be preserved on a space probe in case we destroy the Earth. So that, maybe life of the future gets to experience the amazing and diverse history of this planet. WELL DONE...
So cool
I saw the whole video. It is epic. I will seriously consider puchasing the poster.
This is amazing this animation this music it must have took a long time to animate and best of all it is free to watch.
And religious nut-jobs will deny this and say the world is 6000 years old
hi your on a rock floating in space. pretty cool huh?
I watched the whole thing
banger album tbh
This is insane to think that for every 1 sec that I don't have the patience to wait, time passes 1.5 million years on earth. Truly appreciate the flow of time.
This is amazing!  Idea for another video, I’m wondering how scientist make the timeframe estimation/speculation for these historical past events before the existence of humanbeing itself. Curious how it works!
Nossa o trabalho que nao deu para fazer essa animação, parabéns, amo seus conteúdos. Imagina um dia traduzir para o português ❤
This is just insaneeee!
In which program do you make your animations?
I wonder, wouldn't the stars in the sky change rapidly during such timescales?
AWESOME
This is a great video but I gotta know what the song at the carboniferous stage is, I like it alot.
Since 2019?? Then I wonder how many times they had to "redo" the art and animation because it looks like a normal high quality video from today! 🤔😁  ps: I love the credits-soundtrack!!!! 1:01:48
This is fantastic! You guys must have been stuck in after effects for years to make this video!
bro thinks hes bill wurtz
4.734e+13 seconds pass every second in this
I kinda feel like putting this on in the hour before new year's.
All of human history as told by the bill and Melinda Gates foundation🎉🎉
Props to the camera man for traveling back in time and walking sideways through lava for hundreds of millions of years
12:40
Perhaps the best creation yet to come out of the Kurzgesagt lab. Their other videos are “just” that - brilliantly executed informative videos. This here, it’s an experience. An hour of life well spent. Could even serve as the basis of a group meditation class, even the soundtrack is perfect for it.
love the music
IS THIS FREE???
It's still okay but you could do better. Guess you wanted to maintain timeline proportions which is good but also displayed that first few bilions of years wasnt happening much which is suboptimal when you try to get attention yet 50/64 minutes is somehow boring. Those early eras could use at least some narrative about estimates of radiation, solar activity, temperature, atmosphere composition, geological features originating at time in question, elaborating further on fungi doing fungi things and so on. Visualy it might look nice and music was still better than one in elevator or lounge but video could realy use more time in oven.
shoutout cameraman
I love the soundtrack, also this made me want to play oxygen not included again haha
Thanks for the journey
I really cannot appreciate Kurzgesagt enough, one of the best content creators on Youtube. KEEP GOING GUYS!
29:42 its glitched
Very Nice vidéo!
this video took 4,5 billion years to make, apreciate it
I feel like no ones pointing this out, the sfx artists have done an absolutely marvellous job on this soundtrack!
Wait im confused was the water that rained in the eoarchean era a different kind of water before oxygen formed in Siderian era?
33:00 Btw that impact structure is still visible in google earth. It's in South Africa around the town of Vredefort near Johannesburg. The next largest one is also still visible, it's directly north of Lake Huron in Canada, around Sudbury
To everyone out there: dont watch this without taking LSD-25!
But who delivered the first waters?????
It's just facinating how early life first emerged, yet how long it took for it to become complex.
I’m just gonna give it a like now for the amount of work they’ve put on it. Then I’ll see it.
that feeling when you realize that you have been waiting to see animals and you see them just when the video has less than 10 min to go
Where did all the greenhouse gases go in the Sederian? Couldnt we do the same now?
"The floor is lava"
that has probably never been done before, at least not in the youtube age
Does anyone know a similar channel than this.
Happy Anniversary 😊
What a CONCEITED video and title.
A 1 hour Kurzgesagt video??? I got so excited I screamed XD
Absolutely astonishing! 🤩
Wow 1 hour about the universe??? i know this will be an IPER video. :D Now i can start it
This might be the only video without a kurzgesagt duck present in the video.
So cool to See this . I love it!
Feels like I'm playing bejeweled again with the soundtrack
Most people are here for the evolution of earth, im here for the sick background music
I love science.
Absolutely stunning. Thank you for this treat.
This is a worldview, not entirely scientific.  But I give points to Atheism for inventing an escapism, a compelling fiction.
Thankyou so much for creating this.  I will watch it every day.  Sadly, a financial downturn means I had to cancel my Patreon subscription, but I'm happy I can still support you with extra views.  Best wishes from Czechia.
"Good job if you're still watching" How else am I suppose to see the detail that was put into the video? I was curious if there'd be smooth transitions because they're hard to make, AND THERE ARE! So much respect to the people working with planning and executing the animations.
Damn I really don't have the attention span for this 😅, still an amazing vid tho so im doing my best not to skip a second
Got some Tool vibes from the music
wow one video took 4 yrs to make love you kurzgesagt👏
Masterpiece of art! So beautiful! 😊😊
Just small advice: You can mute this video as well and use it as visual when you're with your friends listening to music or at a party somewhere
thx guys, i was the camera man. it was fun
Wow, How many BIRDS working on this CHANNEL???
By the time you've finished reading this comment, 10 million years have passed in the video. Crazy to think how 100,000 years seems long to humans but is actually unfathomably tiny compared to cosmic perspectives, what humans call eternity is actually  just a "blink of an eye" to the universe. It's mind boggling.
Such amazing work guys 🥲 This really puts things in perspective. I was waiting for the Boring Billion but it never came 😉 keep up the brilliant work, you truly are a gem on the internet.
I would love to see all of human history condensed into a similar span of time. I feel like it would be an interesting contrast to see all of what fit into that last tenth of a second or so.
the attention to detail is insane. I love this. we know what they've been cooking for so long at last.
Hat's off to the guy who produced this idea. This format is creative and innovative!
and do fungi things 😂😂😂
what the heck. 1h of my favorite channel. ok everything now has to wait. have to watch 4.5billion years go past.
The animation, the music, the narration, agh it’s all so damn good! ❤
It will take also 4.5 Billion years that this Video will come to the German cannel.
This is amazing. This should be part of scbool curriculum.
I can't believe I blinked at the end
Its amazing to speculate that in the cryogenian era life was forced so hard against the ropes that individuals had to work together in order to survive. Thats why are all here initially, is to help one another!
This video is one of the most amazing things that I've watched in my entire life! Thanks a lot, Kurzgesagt!
A billion years for nothing
One of the best videos
❤❤❤❤❤Jede Sekunde  Just Loved It
This video took 4.500.000.000 years to make...
Apparently you found daft punk 2.0 as well
This should be a screensaver lol
Awesome!
This is honestly more entertaining then 99% of movies on Netflix even though it’s half the time and Free
All I can do is say wow and give a round of applause 👏👏👏👏👏 Simply wow! Spectacular video!
if 1 sec passed is 1.5m years, dont we shrouldn't be able to see the meteors falling?
I would give everything to have some of the backgrounds sequences as a animated background for my pc. All of them looks amazing!
And to know that some people think the Earth is 6000y old, is mind boggling!
Wow, this is AMAZING! Incredible work by the team. And happy tenth anniversary
Honestly it's the 1st Kurzgesagt video I dislike. Music choice is terrible. What we get is only animation and barely any information. I expected 1h of journey full of commentary. I am disappointed.
ONE HOUR?! The effort they put in into these videos is insane. Thank you Kurzgesagt for blessing us with such high quality content!
I love how we see the heat of the Hadean aeon causing the image to distort slightly.
This is fricking awesome. The concept, the visuals, the music. I love it
Congratulations on such a wonderfully talented video, Kurzgesagt. You've outdone yourself 👏
Very inaccurate
Imagine how awesome would be if it was 24h video, live streaming with some music to study or relax so you would have it on the background and by looking at it you could say something like "oh, it's already on the Rhyacian period, time to grab some lunch".
This is amazing and so immersive, thank you 😘
this is truly amazing
37:11 can anyone elaborate on that one a little? tried goolgling but dont seem to be able to find what im looking for or have overlooked it
LOVE YOU KURZGESAGT ❤
49:07 I love how the drums and MyA timer sync up
Best video yet
It’s crazy to think that earth was so “empty” for so long and when humans came along the began to thrive so fast
At last, something to show to people who think the Earth is only 2,000 years old mostly because they can't grasp large swaths of time.
The fact that we get this is free is crazy I love what kurzgesaght does.
This is so cool, wait wheres morgan freemans voice...
Nah, How the fck is this video 1 hours long???? I'm not prepared to watch this masterpiece 😭😭😭
can you tell how the first cell came to life?
19:42 The Only Thing They Fear is Ducks
This video is very well done,thank you!
This the best scientific, historical drawn art i have EVER seen. I just love it :)
The 1000 monkeys approach to difficult questions.  Give them long enough, hope and -pray- , and finally you'll get the completed works of Shakespeare.
Lets see how many likes we get for the next million years.
this is fantastic! i will play it everywhere in the background
This is so sick
And the Oscar of the best animation goes to Kurzgesagt - 4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour
This really highlights just how much history Bill Wurtz's "The entire history of the Universe I guess" or whatever it's called video skipped. He went almost directly from the rain, at about 8 minutes to the cambrian explosion, at _53_ minutes. That's most of the time Earth's been around there, skipped over casually because not much of interest was happening.
absolutely insane. the musical direction in this video alone is worthy of an award.
I watched the entire video. What a great work, I loved it! Thanks for you passion and love that you put into this.
Bill Wurtz moment
This video is probably the worst i have seen.   It is plain wrong, very misleading and really outdated in so many ways that it will take hours to point them all out.   This result is something one should be ashamed of, not proud.
12:45 I still want to believe the asteroid theory, where there were bacteria in an asteroid that luckily landed on earth and because if it, we're here today 😆
Youtube channels come, YouTube channels go Trends enter and leave and people gain and lose popularity But Kurzgesagt Kurzgesagt will always be
This is wonderful! It really shows how little happened in the first 2 Billion years of earth history
In many aspects it's probably one of the best video you ever produced. I thought you'd slow Don near the end but you didn't and that's fair. Although I hope you'll do the last "bit" in maybe centuries next time because as exciting as it was to see how long life took to sprout, I think everyone deserves to see how short antropocene is (for now) and how we wiped most of that evolution in mere fractions of seconds.
🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🌍 *Introduction to Earth's age* - Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and this video aims to provide a visual journey through its history. 00:30 🔥 *Early Earth and the formation of the moon* - Earth's early history involved a molten surface, and it collided with a Mars-sized object, which formed the moon. 02:11 💥 *Heavy asteroid bombardment and the emergence of life* - Earth experienced heavy asteroid bombardment during its early years, while life began to emerge in the form of the first cells. 07:19 🌊 *Formation of oceans and potential origins of life* - Oceans began to form on Earth, and hydrothermal vents might have been the birthplace of life. 13:31 🌱 *Early evidence of life and the advent of photosynthesis* - Stromatolites provided early evidence of life, and photosynthesis may have started during this time. 18:35 🌋 *Formation of continents and extreme conditions* - Continents started to form, and the planet faced extreme heat and lacked oxygen. 27:57 🌬️ *The Great Oxidation Event and ice ages* - Cyanobacteria introduced oxygen to the atmosphere, leading to the Great Oxidation Event and subsequent ice ages. 41:42 🧬 *Emergence of Eukaryotic cells and changes in the Earth's surface* - Eukaryotic cells appeared, Earth's crust thickened, and continents took shape. 51:25 ❄️ *Cryogenian era and multicellular life* - Earth experienced freezing periods, but multicellular life began to flourish. 53:40 🌍 *Cambrian explosion and diversification of life* - The Cambrian explosion brought a burst of life diversity, including the emergence of various animal groups. 56:14 🌲 *Rise of forests, coal formation, and rapid changes* - Forests and lush marshlands thrived, leading to the formation of coal. 58:02 🦕 *Age of dinosaurs and asteroid impact* - Dinosaurs dominated, but an asteroid impact caused mass extinctions. 59:57 🌍 *Mammals and human history* - Mammals took over, and human history is just a blink of an eye in Earth's timeline.  Made with HARPA AI
Is no one gonna talk abt the music. My head is bopping for an hour straight
Jurrasic park is my favourite part 😂
Wonderful video 🥲
This isn’t too dissimilar to a paper I’m currently writing. You may have heard of the geological clock, where we compress all of earths history into 24 hours. There have been papers about it in the past but they never went into much detail. I’m going into a LOT of detail!
Can we please get a version of this without the music? I wanna play my own music over this when I study :3
This was amazing video. It was not only an animation, this was a movie 🥰
This would be amazing for Wallpaper Engine/Lively Wallpaper

Man I'm high on grass and I'm tripping the fuck out. I'm seeing shit which is not even animated. Love this.
Earth is 4.5 billion years old, Impossible for your brain to truly grasp 😮
They dropped a whole movie wtf.
That unexpected Djent riff at 19:57
Someone´s gonna have to make remixes incoorperating the voice overs
Bill Wurtz been real quiet since this dropped
Wifi lore full season recap
This is a brilliant video!
This really does put into context how recent humans are when the entirety of human history was just 2.6 seconds.
37:07 Wait, what?
Oh oh no 1 h animated video
Ads:
Cambrian starts at minute 53. Holy shit has the history of complex life on earth been a blip
History of the world I guess
Yet another great video and congratulatons on 10 years!
I love all members of the Kurzgesagt team and their work. Really everything the Kurzgesagt team produces is great, especially the music fits perfectly with the phenomenal animation.  Edit: A game like Subnautica produced by Kurzgesagt with the same music in this video would be wild.
wow, this must have been one hell of a thing to animate.
I highly appreciate the soundtrack
amazing video
This can very well be the background of an epic 2D side-scrolling game, journeying for 4.5 Billion years, so many levels and obstacles to fight, like dinosaurs haha. Love it!
Imagine what the next 4.5 billion years will bring
Just. WOW.
This is one of the best video I have seen on this channel. Kudos to the whole team.
I find it insane how many people write „this must have taken ages to animate“, when until the human part all animations are looped every 10 seconds or so. Still a whole amount of effort. But maybe even less than their other regular videos 😂 A video length doesn’t tell the complexity and effort of the animation folks, when do you get it haha One 10 second video could have taken half a year to make. And one 2 hour video could have taken only a day… Just want to open your eyes about this fact :D
Just adding a comment so it reaches more people. Really can't watch this for free.
What an amazing idea!What a wonderful video!I cherished every second!Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
I wonder if any of the made up gods that people believe in were around at the beginning of the video 🤣🤣🤣
and THIS is why i LOVE kurzgesagt
actually got my math study done
its mad to see how long it took for life we reconize to pop up and then just went by so quick 🤯
I would have really appreciated if you showed a bit more how new humanity is. Simethung like "and for human history we are going to go a bit faster in our ride" and then we see cavemen for half a second, then pyramids, a roman soldier and a person from today all within a split second. This way doesnt really show how much happened in how little of time
Great video as usual. Thank you!
If this cannot be called art, what is art?
I gotta figure out how to get this as my computer background
The floor is lava he said.
One whole fu*king hour of kurzegesagt? Well daaaamn!😎
7:37 We would prob like this in winter
Imagine doing something different! You guys really nailed it with this one!
It really shows that you peeps love life :).
Kurzgesagt's one-hour+ knowledge odyssey is a symphony of intellect and creativity. The animated visuals not only simplify intricate ideas but also elevate the learning experience. A brilliant fusion of art and education that leaves you both enlightened and inspired. Pure genius!❤❤❤❤
Enganchado con el video. Es una maravilla la evolución del planeta Tierra. Se puede entender que el paso del hombre es apenas un suspiro comparado a toda la vida de la Tierra. Queda mucho por aprender. Gracias por el video. Saludos desde Paraguay
19:50 Doom music theme  begins  ♪♪♪
Researcher, animator, video editor, narrator, musician when working together to create a masterpiece:
what ? why period of large mushrooms that ruled the earth was skipped ?
Is it just me or the some parts of the music is suitable for a shopping mall

I just woke up and watched the entirety of this video at 1x speed and I must say this was the best hour I’ve had in a while. This is the without a doubt the most beautiful video in all of YouTube. I never thought I would cry from experiencing our planet’s history, but somehow, @Kurzgesagt, you did it and here I am, feeling so much things that I cannot even explain. Thank you so much
Suddenly I feel like playing ye olde SimEarth again.
The Matrix glitched at 24.44
what a banger!!!!!! 🔥
❤❤❤
This is the most beautiful thing my two small eyes have ever witnessed!! I love it!!!
Im confused becouse they said stromatolites came before cyanobacteria? 41:41 me?!?!?!?! 55:47 fish are the first vertebrate... 1:00:00 cadence!!!
you havent really showed anything, mostly just surface, what about primordial organisms n stuff? my god

Gutsy move. I like it. Some of the animation must have had an AI assist for efficiency.
Kurzgesagt can make videos on so many good topics & this is how they waste their time.
4 years in the making. Wow 🎉❤😂😊
Incredible. If only a lot more of YT created content as passion-filled as you guys do, what a much better internet we would all have.
I wish there was a game where you could watch the evolution of a young galaxy or stargroup and interfere with its evolution   Only game i know that is close to this is The Fermi Paradox
It would be inappropriate not to watch all of this given the extraordinary effort and care that went into its making
i saw the hidden face😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was amazing 😍 I've watched it through at the edge of my seat
damn nobody talked about he moves few meters every few milions years and the  night or day or rain never goes down in millions of years
I love this so much, took me 10 million years just to write this comment!
i wonder why people with sponsorblock marked like half of the video as filler not as attack on the video but like why would they see around half of the video as filler
Last 20,000 years would have been just one frame at 60fps.
I love this channel, but i wan't this video in Kurzgesagt BR
New content for us adhd’ers to fall asleep to 🙏
And this is why you should value your every second
This is just as good as the video about the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. Fantastic work.
The soundtrack reminds me of Terriaria , anyone else?
What a masterpiece, just watched it from beginning to end and I can't find words - I just want to feed the algoritm of YouTube with a comment, maybe it helps a little for suggesting the video for more people. This must be seen by everyone.
@kurzgesagt you should upload version of this without any commentary too!
yk shit is real when kurzgesagt uploads a 1 hour long video
Kurzgesagt: The movie
gonna speed this video up so its only 20 minutes so i can play it side by side with Bill Wurtz's History of the Earth in 20 minutes and learn twice as fast
This was absolutely magnificent. The animations and the music are so beautiful.
Now do 1 hour in 4.5 billion years.
Fun fact - Kurzgesagt means ‘in short’
God left the voice chat
What an amazing experience it was! Thank you Kurzgesagt!!
This really shouldn't be free and I'd pay to see this.
1 hour long video on a German channel. It had to be trance playing in the background! 😍
What a masterpiece ! Incredible journey of life,  amazing journey of earth and their intertwined journey together.
Congratulations for such an incredible accomplishment! This master piece was aswome. I enjoyed every second of it!
Lovely timeline!
YOU ARE CRAZY 🤯 THANK U SO MUCH!
I appreciate the hard work making this video. From getting information and animation. I salute to you man
sooo, the history of the entire world, I guess....?
❤❤❤
39:39 is a long night
This would be great as a live wallpaper
Never thought Kurzgesagt would make this (Big) Banger.
“You didn’t have to cut me off”
I hope you know how outstanding your work is
25:20
As a digital animator I just want to express my appreciation for what I know is a PHENOMENAL amount of effort you put into this production. Apart from the subject matter being informative and interesting, I also had a time fun identifying the effects and composition tricks you used. You have a new subscriber!
Super good vidio
This video must be a compulsory watch for every human being so that our humans in general have high scientific temper.
Great video. Loved the art too. Most of the music was a vibe. Good job.
Don't blink or you might miss all of human history 🤣 1:00:41
Okay but this needs a part two where the last minute is taken and blown up to a whole video by itself 😅
wow they been working on this since 2019
Why is everyone saying this is good it’s unwatchable 20 minutes in and nothing has really been said. Just bad music
NAH
Could be shorter. There’s like 10 minutes of narration or even less
That is one chill video
Beans
It is very surprising that I saw this wonderful, elegant, and information-rich high-quality video without pay ANYTHING!!!
Unbelievable this is truly amazing
Everyone really needs to like this video.
Love the soundtrack of this video.
Please upload this video also in hindi in your hindi channel
This is beautiful. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
Bloody hell. How to ruin a perfect hour of hypnotising footage with terrible 'music' going on, far too loud and constantly the same. I had to skip. Thank you (NOT).
1:00:44 Lil bro chopping a mix for his bong 😂😂
Where does all the water come from? "There was some water" to "It rained for millions of years"? When was the atmosphere formed?
to be honest, the humans time on screen was much longer than i expected.
Would LOVE to see a video like this about the human history specifically!
This is a religion, no scientific facts for this.
aint no way they made an hour long video of perfection and ruin it by saying "ME thane"
The title of the video says billions but time indicator in video says million. I think you missed this confusion.
Now I find what I show my students as a teacher in a science class when I hard to control them.
This is insane work..
This is my 3rd time watching it. Its not even online for a day. Its an hour long. Should be some sort of measurement on how excellent this video is. Cheers and thank you for that
The kurzgesagt movie is here
4.5 billion years of animation in the making, keep up the insane work! Love the song was prefect with the animation
Great tunes!
Love the video and the music SLAPS DAMN
Everyone in the Kurzgesagt team deserves the greatest applaud, outstanding video and thank you for each video you make.
This would be a killer wallpaper/screensaver
Incredible!🎉🎉🎉
Damn
This is why I want Spore 2, imagine the simulation!
I love the Ectasian part music
Hats off to the music producer.  An hour of coherent music so absolutely fitting the animation was such a blast.
Love this
Amazing Stuff. 👏
The amount of effort put into this is just amazing
watch this on double speed and you will jump between psy trance, heavy metal and psyhedelic rock
Bless you! At 39:54, lol - also, "but yes, kind of looks not that impressive" right after might be a minor slip-up in wording. Otherwise awesome video
I didn’t know it took so long for the Earth’s core to form. Were the magnetic fields (etc.) different before this or was the physical form of the core irrelevant for these?
Best video ever in all YouTube history ❤
Cant wait for next years version! Just need to add 0.8 micro seconds 😅 I really love the vibe of the music!
"WAKE UP BABE KURZGESAGT DROPPED AN HOUR LONG VIDEO"
Imagine watching this high💥
True epicness! 👍❤
Thank you for your passion and helping to fuel ours ❤
Much hot and comfy. Favourite quote 😅
🕺💃🕺💃🕺
Best moment in Earth history: 45:00
I started writing in the Eoarchean and ended up in the 20th century!!! What I don't understand is how it rained for so many millions of years, where did so much water come from if there were no oceans?
The music is dope af
insane quality
29:43 proof we're living in the matrix
In the age of shorts and tiktoks, Kurzgesagt launches an astonishingly good 1h video, and I binge watch it full. Twice. No matter what my plans were!
Now I need a 10 hour version
Insane! I don't wanna know how long that video took...
the bible: god created this planet in 6 days and took a rest kurzgesagt:
This was intresting video, bit different from the usual videos and I just vibed to the music :D
This video was amazing
At this point, Kurzgesagt is just a production company that makes bangers every time
Earth's history-in a nutshell
59.58 entire history 0.01 human history  we are soooooooo baby in this earth timeline
Oh man this looks insane! I'm gonna save this video for later to watch on TV with some snacks, this is one of those good good vids :)
i need this in wallpaper engine. Great video
I honestly was unsure if I could enjoy this, but after watching this the entire experience was simply amazing! I can't comprehend how one would showcase the entire timeline of our earth but you guys have done an amazing job! Massive props to the entire team
Big respect to the Sound designer, that sound track was 🔥🔥🔥
trippy
Even if it’s an 1 hour video,kurzgesagt keeps on finding ways to keep us entertained
Amazing video, kids love it And me too! So much knowledge in one video 👍👌🏻✌️😍
I love this even though its slightly inaccurate/misleading at times
A great video, one of the most entertaining, informative and beautifully drawn hours on all of YouTube!!
Love this
Frankly I just skip to when the narrator talks XD
Put interstellar in the back trust me
Does anyone know ehy the Calymmian, Ectasian and Stenian ages had so many diagonal blurry clouds by the mountains? I feel like there’s some cool reason behind it
You guys are so generous to give us this masterpiece for free. ❤❤
Very impressive
Masterpiece.
As always, great content, and thanks for putting this together... BUT... right in the beginning - what kind of force would cause the proto-moon to orbit AWAY from the earth ??? It is not like it has it's own jet engine to speed up ? Or was the mass of earth decreasing ? this aspect is not explained that well...
I was there, when it all began. Ask me anything!
I love you, Kurzgesagt ❤
Woaaah!
The scary thing is that your whole life can go into this movie and it will only be about 0.008 percent of a second!!
i'll watch this when i get stoned
Dearest Kurzgesagt team,  I'm just a normal subscriber and I'm not sure if you'll ever read this comment, but I just want to say thank you for this 1 hour video (I watched every second of it). As I'm writing this, I'm currently on a vacation, and everytime when I have a bubble bath, I will always watch your videos (especially videos from The Existential Crisis Playlist and the Human Stuff). It is the best place for me to relax and to learn new things from one of my favorite channels.  I've been following your content for over 6 years and I'm so blessed to learn so much from the team. Thank you to everyone for working hard on this passion project. Your videos have really made my vacations at least 4.5 billion times better.  I look forward to your next video <3  Cheers from Singapore.
Blud stole millions of your from people watching his vid😂
at what point was earth livable? like you can go out and not die due to lack of oxygen?
53:47 my favorite animal anomalocaris has appeared
You guys did not talk about human extinction due to climate change. Video is incomplete
"Don't blink or you might miss all of human history!" in a split second the entire human history is gone in a 1 hour long video
hour of kursgesagt is probably the best investment of time i can make while being on youtube. the quality is unearthly
Ngl, this is a miss for me. Huge potential for informative content, but instead the video is 95% music with some barebones commentary. Cool animations but you could have done way more with this than just a musical
Just out of curiosity, what's the earliest period we think we could time-machine a current human to and think they'd have a relatively good chance of survival (temperature, atmosphere, food and water wise)?
Bro Wth, 1 hour of animation?! Is this a movie? >_> Amazing!!
This was a fantastic video, thank you for making and sharing this. I wish the radioactivity of early Earth was included too.
I'm not gonna lie, the whole electro dance music vibe really turned me off. It's not that I don't like dance music but it's not what I'm here for and it's not what this channel has been selling itself as for, what, a decade now? I mean yeah, celebrate yourselves, you've done great, but chopping up musical bits with facts and ideas sprinkled in is not what your brand has come to represent.
Great video! Thank you so much for producing it! One thing you left out was the Earth's polarity, since it has switched many times over the years. It would have been interesting to see if the N/S pole changes interacted with the different phases of history. This type of video could dramatically help scientists visualize how our environment changed over the millennia. Excellent work!
There was a question in earth science exam. How long each Era takes in the several hours of Documentary? Suppose that ratio of time is proportional to actual time ratio of actual geological Era. I thought that who will watch this boring documentary, but I'm watching it now.
well done!
I actually blinked and had to rewatch human history lol
Time to wash dishes
cheers to all of us lucky enough to be on Earth 🎉🍻
As much as I loved your music, I'd love this with just narration so I can play my own music over it, maybe Dark Side of the Moon or similar. This is amazing though!
I like how the mesoarchean age is the “TOOL” age
It is a nice experience to put time in perspective, thanks for that and everything else! ❤
we need this as one long wallpaper that loops
Incredible work! I always found it sad how the Precambrian is neglected and cut short in most time scales, while time itself is the most mind-blowing thing here. It took 3.5 bln years just to set the stage for complex multicellular life by increasing the O2-levels, fixing the oceans chemistry, evolving eucaryotes etc. This video shows it perfectly.
When does the album drops? 👀
Thank you. I cried.
A wonderful journey! Many thanks
Were colonies of precursor Corals the first "multicellular animals"? Sticky sludges of something basking in warm sea currents under a dappled sunlight.
Instant classic. Destined to be the first hour of any history 101.
I think the meteor part is kinda misleading, the transition could be better explained, but overall, great video.
"Geology is not so boring" Geology:
1 hour of OST!!
German version???
Oh Kurzgesagt, your video's art, A journey through time, a masterful chart. Earth's tale in hours, 4.5 billion years, A cosmic odyssey that brings joyous cheers.  From primordial chaos to life's humble start, Each frame a masterpiece, a visual art. Your narrative prowess, a story well-told, In one brief hour, Earth's epic unfold.  With animations dancing, colors so bright, You guide us through ages, a celestial flight. Deep into history, where rocks whisper tales, A symphony of knowledge, your video unveils.  The birth of continents, the oceans' grand dance, Life's emergence, a mesmerizing trance. Mass extinctions and rebirths anew, Kurzgesagt, your storytelling, always true.  Complexity unraveled, simplicity sought, In the vastness of time, where lessons are taught. A cosmic ballet, a visual feast, Oh, Kurzgesagt, your content, the best.  So here's a salute to your Earthly embrace, A video masterpiece, a journey through space. In 60 minutes, you painted the sublime, Kurzgesagt, your brilliance, through time.
This was incredible! I didn't think I'd watch the whole thing in one sitting, but I'm glad I did. It's the best way to truly appreciate the just how long 4.5 billion years is.
We have a wonderfull planet, don't we ❤
This is soooooo epic
AMAZING!
55:47 go back
This is sooooo cooll!!!!!!!!! like OMG, you guys put so much effort into these and it is definitely worth it!
Bro the moon slowly changes
This gave me an existental crisis
Ngl i expected the whole human age to just zoom right past us at the speed of light
Can you expand it to a three-episode miniseries about the history of the universe?
Can we  get more vids like this? But then how humankind develops.
a bit awkward to watch without narration, had to skip a lot
Also who is responsible for this awesome music??
Great video. I watched almost the whole video.  It got me to thinking, life has been here for over 2 billion years ago, and humans have come on the scene about 100k years ago.  Life as a concept is, cells, that reproduce the information they have added with it's own learning.  Earth as a planet has life, and I feel human, another form of life have a responsibility to propogate it.  Don't get me wrong I'm not saying have more kids. I am saying we should send different life forms everywhere. on space missions, so other planets can also have a chance at life, maybe in the future. Humans can't survive in those environments. but it is possible other life forms might...  and then evolve into something completely new...  it would be great if we can also propogate human species to that too, but life having a chance at it on another planet would not be bad...  We won't be there to witness it, but we sure would be the species that would have started life on those planets.
Took me 500 million year to eat my chocolate while watch this vidio
The HUMANS! in a blink of an eye 😮
masterpiece :)
This was a freaking master piece
THE FLOOR IS LAVA!
I don't why would people dislike this?
Love how accesible this is
A two-hour IMAX version would be epic!
The music kinda slaps in the Mesoarchean
This is amazing!!!
The BGM is very DOPE!!!
Besides the animation, can we talk about the music??? Nearly an hour of bangers
All of existence led up to this comment ive just now made
at 13 minutes in the video ive already watched 1 billion years😯
Kinda love the background music
The moon and earth are not related in any way. It's been proven that the isotopes are different. Don't mislead people.
❤
I'm the only one? Even if I don't have yt premium this video keeps playing in PiP mode on my iPhone...
"The floor is earth 4500 Million years ago"
i'd love if this were in a game and we could just pause in a timeline and look around
I take it back, the cryigenian is so pretty..
life is great
“Did I hear, still much hot? Wow. Who engineered this audio this videos grammar and sentence structure in English.  Say “Still VERY hot” 😂which  is an example
Thanks for this video! I'm going to watch it in its entirety later.
Once one of my teachers put kurtgesagt on the tv for a class and I was super happy to watch it again😊
So basically we could create life on a different planet if we put the right chemicals in the water, and left the right bacteria in there to create the right atmosphere. Someone would have to watch over it for a couple billion years, but it would be kinda cool.
Surprisingly relaxing! Well done, this must of been a huge undertaking.
Epic journey! Awesome masterpiece)
Speed up the video to 1.5 trust me, it's worth it
Orosirian made me wait a for an astroroid to hit earth 😭
What a cliffhanger at the end there! I'll bet episode 2 is gonna be EPIC!!! 😁
To merely say that I love everything you do would be an extreme understatement of how much I appreciate your work and how much I believe it to be necessary and important.  I hope one day your successfulness raise the awareness for the need of such content; those who investigate with no intent but to only inform and with no political agenda.
When I saw the length of this video I instantly thought "Well this isn't exactly 'in a nutshell' is it?". I'm surprised to find out that it is. There is just so much history to talk about that you need a sizeable nutshell to cram it in.
Please upload a version of this with music only.
Is it me or a few minutes into the mesoarchean The music sounded like Doom or something like that cuz the guitar lmao
Unbelievably high effort on display!
I'm getting Subnautica vibes from this
One of the most underrated videos ive ever seen , thanks a lot for all the efforts❤
It was much easier when god made it in 7 days ....
@Kurzgesagt you are the best thing to ever happen in the history of the world. You are the essence of the best aspects of humanity, technology and communication. I love you with both brain and heart. Thank you for being you <3
Astonishing work. Thank goodness I clicked. Them pesky ai posting channels made me a bit hesitant to click. They ruin it for these amazing creations. Instant sub
Congrats to 10 years of awesome content, or happy 10th birthday Kurzgesagt.
Looks nice but the earth is only 6000 years old
"in a nutshell"
this is like the bill wurtz video about the world but in chill
The gravitational friction in those first billion years... incredible.
People who deny evolution theory fail to realize how tremendously big the number of 4,5 BILLION years is. I can grasp 1000 years, and maybe 2000 but I already get lost at 10 000. And that's only a fraction of a second of this video...
thankful to the team, hats off!
Lol I'm not ready for the one hour long video from Kurzgesagt 😂
Wonderful, thankyou
Perfect video to watch ending at 5:28 am
What a fantastic ideia!!!!! Wonderfull !! Unbelieble
Filming 4.5 billion years must have been tough, props to you!
Never thought i would be watching 4.5 billion years of earth at 4 in the morning this took me 30 million years to write
44:53 so you tell me there "isn't much going on" when there's a Panthalassa-sized algae orgy!
Beautiful, thank you.
1:36 "and the floor is lava" 🗣🗣🗣💯💯💯
You know another thing i really think we cannot truly grasp? Just how vastly immense some structures are in space. Just imagine the level of electromagnetism, static charges, density, mass, temperature ranges, radiation, etc. Imagine what roles & impacts they might be occuring on scales and intensities of that nature.. in space too.. so that adds a extra layer of "how would this work/behave With-in the structure of this system in a environment that is the vastness of space.."
The greatest video ever made
There's talk about the HEAT DEATH of the Universe, but not many talk about the HEAT BIRTH of our EARTH!
great video, the soundtrack is an absolute banger. Keep up the great work.
Happy anniversary! This was a great video!
I had bought a new tv and now I’ve realized what for I did it! Nice evening is coming!
This is awesome!and the music is dope af!
It's fascinating how for the most of life existence, it wasn't even visible for the naked eye. It makes you wonder, maybe the universe is full of life, but nearly all of it never left the beginning stages.
One of most enjoyable hours of my life thanks kurzgesagt😊👌
Amazing! To think The Floor Is Lava dates back 4,500m years..
Mindblowing
I usually never write comments, but this Video is insane. This is all for free and probably took you ages to animate. Thank you for doing this for all of us.
The Mesoarchean part was a banger! 🤘 Wow!
Unreal, so excited!!!!
Imagine that life is just a terraforming experiment and we come from deeper origins,
really cool but i think a little bit more diversity in the genra of the music could have make it even better even if i think you had to use chill and calm (maybe copyright free music)  and a little bit more talking but still excellent work
Hot take but this is kurzgesagt's worst video. Literally 80% of the video is nothing but music and repeated animations (yes I know that in 80% of earth's life nothing happened too but still). There's no details whatsoever between eras and information is very very shallow.
You start to think and  enter a tunnel and then The voice starts when you are not expecting and snap you out of it. 😂
This is the best Divali present I have ever got 🎁.
if this video came out two weeks ago i would have watched it while studying for my hsc earth and environmental science exam
That duck turns me on
Thanks Bangiomorpha pubescens!
Is this Kurzgesagt's own attempt at a "History of the Entire World I Guess"?
Wtf ?
Wow this is amazing.. felt like a higher dimensional being witnessing the creation process :)
I played this on 2x speed and still cool
I am usually not a fan of long videos, but i have to admit it was a relaxing and intresting ride. Also good job with the music and the animation, i think it was a really really hard work to animate a hour of landscapes.
This was so relaxing to watch early in the morning, horrific stages of Earth’s life with a bit of calming music makes it so pleasing to look at rather then being scared or abit nervous. Why does this not cost money like all other movies? This doesn’t deserve to be free even for educational purposes- i feel smarter everyday looking at your videos
❤❤
45:02 : Sex alpha version is out
it's astonishing that life is only visible to the naked eye in the last 10 minutes of this artwork
Absolutely love this video! Thank you for bringing such beauty to education
OH COME OOOOON i litteraly just did a project about this last weeeeek this woulda been so helpful
I love this channel and the fact that you gys had been working on this since 2019 is just amazing and commendable
BABE, WAKE UP 1 HOUR KURZGESAGT VIDEO DROPPED
The animation is absolutely amazing. Happy 10th kurzgesagt
AMAZING! 10/10 i wanna this in my animated wallpaper =)
This was actually such a cool experience. Will you also do one with only the human history? 🥺💞
Because video so bored, you then took effort to BGmusic. That so cool!!
Amazing video loved it. Also magnificent music
I’m just gonna go ahead and say that the siderean looks so amazing and euphoric (I’ve only wantched this 20 minutes so far)
This was big. Love it!
Great work!!÷ Ty....
For all time. Always
The people at kurzgesagt want to sell us an artistic masterpiece  as a simple youtube video and thought we wouldn't notice
Most people talk about how good the animation is. Let’s also appreciate this MUSIC!!!(It is just awesome!)
The best Video of the last 4.5 Billion years 🎉
That was a lot of rain
Kurzgesagt... THIS is why we support you. THIS is why we buy your calendars and other merch. THIS is why we keep watching and loving what you do. You have earned, in my opinion, the title of the greatest account in the history of YouTube. Years of magnificently well-made content by an ingeniously talented team. Breathtakingly beautiful videos that could save the human race. The more people watch Kurzgesagt, the more humanity has a future we can fight for.
Awesome! Watched till the end!
the best kurzgesagt video ever
this is so interesting, watched all of it
Creationist: this is boring, i like how god made it...out of magic for just 6 days. Isn't that amazing..  Me: come here you little....
44:53 sex was invented by hezuikn
If a Christian made this video, using the same scale as 1 second = 1.5 million years, the whole video would be 0.004 seconds. Boring!
Nice video! Although I also found another video that only took 20 minutes explaining the same thing. Nevertheless, great work!
took me a billion years to think of this comment
I love you❤😂🎉
<3!
It took 10 hours to make 1 second. Taking 4 years to make 60 minutes of animation.
THNAK YOU FOR UPLOADING RIGHT THIS IS MY CURRENT PPT
I love this
no way they made a whole ass movie. This is a work of art. I have no words.
29:40 Often overlooked bit of Earth's history when there were a weird few decades of glitchy seas
major respect to the guy who voiced this whole channel for years, thank you
Love the soundtrack too!
funny how the one second of human is about to destroy 4,5 billion years of evolution
Apparently the amazing soundtrack is in synch with the Wizard of Oz
can we have a shorter, compressed version of this? with all the silent parts cut out?
This feels like one of those movies that is uneventful in the beginning until it gets to the last 15 mins where you wish there's more
Amazing vid, please keep up the good work. We love your content!
I wonder how the earth looks at us each time we say "Lets save the planet" 😂
Absolutely smashed it with this one. Well done!
This took since the Hadeon period just to write!
Wow.   Rarely comment, but wow. Superb video, a little daunting!
The fact it opens up a new tab on its own and still plays even when you exit the app amazes me. Like when did YouTube update this??
“Much hot and comfy”…. Was this video AI generated?
I mean this way of storytelling is impressing, but it would be nothing without this music. Soo good.
Now that was simply beautiful
The perfect animated OLED animated wallpaper doesn't exists...ed until now. :) And you also released this insanely good music in lossless. Thank you for this, it's amazing!
Quelle voyage ,merci !!!
crazy idea, great that you guys went on with it
Makes it feel like earth has just began to wake up isn't it
Thank you, you are awesome. And I now have so many of your posters that I've ran out of wall space and have to start rotating posters from time to time. Great problem to have!
I love this video and the ending was expected but still astonishing
Wow... I mindlessly clicked on the new Kurzgesagt video thinking I'd get 8-12 minutes of some interesting sciency tidbits to stoke curiosity and expand horizons and instead I'm treated to a feature length presentation designed to help us grasp the span of time on earth.  Starting to get ambitious!  .....Do the universe next. :D
Premium content for free thank you so much
The ambient electronica was an incredible addition to the video. Extremely hypnotic and meditative :)
a 1 hour long fully edited video? dear jesus
We have all this animation for free ? I think I'll put it as my wallpaper once I have a desktop pc.
I fell asleep to this, feel old as shit now
When the credits rolled I literally started clapping. Unbelievable… the time and effort went into this is absolutely mindblowing.
This is amazing, also the soundwork is really well done. Great work. Thank you!!
I love this, incredible work, but I just wish you had explained things a bit more. Like why Cryogenic Period happened, or why the first extinction event happened. With a few sentences at least.
A 1 hour kurzgesagt video? Am I dreaming?!
Now I wanna see the behind the scenes on the making of this video. I wanna see the whole team as well. It's been 10 years! Who's with me?
I still don't believe this is free
Magnificent idea, video and music! Well done guys, you are always the best :)! It was my pleasure watching this video!  I very like to collect and polish amber! It would be really great if someday you will create video about this outstanding time capsule!  Thank you very much for your job!
Was the transition from lava lake to solid ground really that fast in correlation?
Insane!
I’ve only watched for about 3 minutes and it’s already my favourite Kurzgesagt video
I was wondering how it will fill to be alive back then
Whats amazing is that  every part of our molecular integrity or our atoms have been through this since the big bang. and now we are a clump of them all watching other atoms simulate what they have seen billions of years ago.
Tonian Era has some major TOOL music vibes. Incredible job on the music. This is better than some full length albums.
🎉 this was wonderful
53:14 that was the most fascinating wow kurzgesagt ever gave
Been watching this for a few million years now, loving it so far!
This should be a wallpaper engine background just goes through the entire thing
The synth during the beginning of this is soooooo good. I’m only a few minutes into this and loving this
Epic Mountain Music has gone insane with the BGM
Almost thought this wasn't the real kurzgesagt channel coz 1 hour of content is crazy! 👏👏 Mad props to you guys! Animating this wasn't easy but thank you.
If you think I will spend an hour of my time watching an earth entire history video from Kurzgesagt then you're absolutely right!!!
Why are you saying this like it must be true? I know...  cause satan likes it...
You guys outdid yourselves with this one. Kudos!
♾️
This deserved cinema release
Congrats for the cameraman for surviving the dinosaurs astroid 😂
Woww omg happy anniversary X3 it does feel like it's been a while since i started watching your vids :3
happy 10 years old!
I feel like this video is exactly why I bought a second screen on my computer years ago. Thanks for the amazing content, thanks for keeping up with the positive vibes and the marvels of our worlds in dire times.
I'm so thankful the cameraman survived 4.5 billion years just to film this historical beauty of earth.
Super cool! It took me a while before I realized that we weren't going to see humanity's part of history. The video really gives you perspective...
Can we get PC wallpapers from the differend eras? I thought that the Hadean era looked so cool but I don't want to ruin it by editing the text out by myself
Anoth break at 41:14
This made me cry Kurzgesagt. I watched the entire thing. Life illustrated in this way has shown that we have done so much work just to get to where we are. We were wiped out 5 times, and even still life persists. It is beautiful. Thank you so much for this. I rarely leave comments, but this moved me to the point of crying.
Nice music!
This video would be the best Desktop wallpaper
Wow...
41:42 It's Funging time 🍄
Man this is so nostalgic, I remember swimming around in the water and eating sunlight with the boys!
Incredible again!
i dont think this generation will be able to watch this whole thing in one sitting cuz of their attention span
27:00 The new Terraria update is fire!🔥
After watching this and feeling thankful for this masterpiece I’m definitely buying a calendar from you this year.
why wasnt i jamming to the backgroud music and waiting for the beat drop,good job on this video
Absolutely fascinating!! What an amazing job guys!! Congratulations!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
DUDE!!!. This..?.? For free???
3AM video time.
Mappa animators workload😭
44:55 Epic gamer moment
Props to everyone who made this, but what really stood out for me is the music.
Nice video but I recommend to watch with 1.75x speed because first 50 minutes is just wasting of precious time. You could condense those 50 min in 5 min and still nothing would be missed. It supposed to be kurz gesagt.
What a masterpiece! Personally, flooding information instead of all that silence would've suited the watch time and viewer interest better.. But I see your vision.

its funny since people  believe that the evolution is a  proven fact rather then being a trashy kids cartoon theory
Crazy how we've been able to conclude all this by just studying the geological record
Exceptional ❤
damn, even though we sped up time a lot, this is still an hour long, and we are barely seen.
Quotable quotes: "the floor is lava" and " Life finds a way"
ok
pov : a new kurzgesagt video drops and its a saturday
That was a pretty neat experience. Thank you!
This was beautiful (:
Glad to see Tool started as early as stenian period
I love this
The sun get's 10 times smaller from the beginning to 1 billion years lol
Science is heartwarming ❤️ thanks Kurzgesagt!
I thought this would be a couple different videos together but no it’s a whole new video also life just started and it took me 30 million years to write tis
Every Kurz Gesagt video dropping is a cause for celebration,  but your Opus Dei was a unexpected cerebral smorgasbord of joy. I watched it with my kids last night. My younger autistic son who is seven and knows all of the eons and eras from the Cambrian onwards was particularly spellbound.  The music had me thinking of Jean-Michel Jarre, very suitable  Please do the same thing for the/a future now!  Also, can you get together with Douglas Adams's estate to create a H2G2 book?
This ist amazing. True masterpiece
Don't mind me, I'm just vibing on my bed for 4541 Million years before falling asleep.
Wow :))))))
So grateful we get to enjoy this amazing content for free ! Amazing job !!
Damn this is long
Dont blink or you will miss the emerge of the cilvilization lol
I missed the part where human exists and had to rewind 😂
Best techno set of 2023. I want this without voice over nor text to blast it at my next house party 🔥
This deserves an Oscar for the best animation
I believe in God and I think the teaching of the theory of evolution on its own has in great part led to a trans generational moral complicity where we see people without moral compass and chanting phrases like “do what feels good and love is love and that there’s no right or wrong”.    As a result we now see a situation where the outliers and the anomaly has now become the mainstream and something to be aspired to.  I wish alongside this information religion would be taught and not shunned. Maybe then, the “selfish gene” or “selfish organism” which Dr Richard Dawkins spoke about would be Recognised and reigned in and individualism and hedonism would not be so rampant today.  The video was brilliantly done! Never have I seen something quite like it!
LLLLOOOOVVVVVEEEE IT. 1 HOUR OF SO INTRESTING STUFF IS SOOO COOOOOL <3
Absolutely amazing, like, shared and commented, I'll buy some merchandise for the first time
Hahah the human history part was so funny cuz we tend to think of ourselves as so important but we have been here so short
Oh Kurzgesagt, you made it again!
Start of the earth looks like world 8 in all mario bros games
I noticed in the end that i can watch this video in "picture in picture" mode on my phone without yt premium.
great video
I almost couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this in my feed. This is actually insane! Thank you everyone from Kurzgesagt for this absolute masterpiece
Is there an audio only version on Spotify? If there isn't. There should be.
Slipping in the “Life, er, finds a way” quote in there was marvelous
This was such a great video! Please continue to experiment with random video ideas in the future! Thank you for the amazing content!
The video made me so emotional. It's like watching how your baby grows. Although, these are rather us, who are babies on our mother-planet. The life is so fragile and yet so robust at the same time.  Thank you Kurzgesagt for this amazing experience.
RIP history majors
Kurtzgesagt BillWurtz speedrun?
damn, the animator created the animation for 4.5 billion years
Extraordinary 👍 Much Respect.
Makes us realize how short we (humans) have been on this planet.  Just a few thousand years over several billion years.   Amazing
Awesome!!!
You guys are unbelievable... thank you for your hard work! ❤️🙏
still couldn't best "history of the entire world, i guess" (for the sake of my sanity, THIS IS A JOKE)
History of the entire world i guess
the humanity, I think, the new villain 😂
4 years in the making for this... thats some time spent damn well
Amazing
What a massive project for the animators, well done and thank you ❤
This is incredible, the amount of work is to be applauded. I hope this becomes your best performing video!
I was expecting right here right now song from fat boy slim in the background 😂
Shout-out to the cameraman for getting this amazing footage
Some very mick gordon riffs in there. Sick music.
Thank you for making this video!  I've been waiting for something like this for half my life!
bill wurtz did it better
It's like a God gets less and less enjoyment out of small changes and requires change at an exponential rate to achieve satiation. Here we are at saturation of the requirements and where do we go from here?...
This really put my attention span to the test
58:10  NICE😂
dude I'm crying watching this, you guys are so cool. Making an animation of our earth for over 4 years, we appreciate this! This will inspire our next generations!! Thanks Kurzgesagt, without you.. we know nothing about our earth, and their journey. Again, thanks.
Damn the Queen was lonely for a long time.
It's like in a dream... Amazing! Also planning to get your game! Can't wait to play it!
The graphics look mesmerizing. What an interesting breakdown of events. We look forward to see more.
Boosting a comment which suggested making this an art installation, somehow printing it out and having it run along the corridors or floor of a natural history museum or gallery
Why the dance club noise?
Probably the best video I've ever watched 😭
Very well done
I thought my YouTube was glitched when it said 1 hour, insane 🤯
Amazing video, props to the sound guy, slapping soundtrack!
my dream video by my favorite channel omg 🥹
Amazing work! I love the music
Theyre becoming bill wurtz
We know what to watch after getting high on mushrooms. Insane video. You guys have outdone yourselves. Thank you.
wow
How much did this video cost?
Didn’t know Sidney opera house was 3.1 billion years old. 19:02
WHERE DID THE RAIN COME FROM?!
This is so beautiful I love it so much 😭
I keep thinking "It truly must have been a sight to behold"
51:10 it's very chilling to hear the narrator say we're not sure lol, kinda emphasizes how miraculous it is that life managed to survive even that period
45:00 they invented sex, wow... it would be so popular 😂😂😂
Best video on youtube.
I would love to have each section/chapter of this video to be a 10 hour video of just asmr like "10 hours of eoarchean"
Props to the music producer, music is fire.
Man! I knew what was going to happen but I was still so astounded when the video got to the end!
Fake.  The earth is only 5000 years old
good
You guys have outdone yourselves once again. Phenomenal
When the beat drops after 3:50 😮   And another one at 43:15 with a legit prog rock sound, zzzzaaaaaaammmn
I'm just vibing to the amazing electronic Hadean soundtrack
Thanks for your hard work ❤ I laughed the human history part 😂
Okay but can we talk about how the music absolutely SLAPS?
This reminds me of that legendary futurama episode where Fry, Bender and the Proffessor travel trough Earth history... Twice!
I believe that This video have shown to many of us that When seeing the timescale of event's of the earth and life formation,  you realize that the event of dinosaurs extinction happened in a blink of an eye, but looking only to that event, it took many years.
Holy shit!!!!!! Thank you all❤❤❤❤
44:55 sex update just dropped
Thank you. I love this. Perfect timing btw. It helps me survive one of the longest trips back home ever. ❤
earth lore
Hi  This is one of the most interesting videos.. Thanks
This may take 4 years to make holly
like my comment but this video is good relllay good
The average human lifespan is approximately 0.0053 % of every single second that passes during this video. You could fit 18 750 human lifetimes in a single second in this video.   And for most of earth's history, before complex biospheres, that would mean practically nothing has changed whatsoever. And even that is still peanuts compared to the vast cosmological timescales that dwarf even our planet's lifespan...
Just amazing... WOW
The camera man deserves a raise
everybody's so intrested in the art when the music is just as amazing too
His voice is so soothing
This video was extremely wonderful and amazing. I couldn’t believe that i watched a 1h video and didn't even realize that much time has passed.
❤❤
[x] doubt
1:00:10 DODO MA MAN 🦤🦤🦤
May the animator's hands Rest in Peace ;-;
Everything is an assumption 😢
This is *marvelous*. Big thanks to the whole team. <3
Am finally convinced that Kurzgesagt is the only person in the world who can call time travelling an "experience" ☠
Billions of years of evolution, life & death. And now we have VTubers 😎😎👌👌
Shout out to the Mesoarchean for having the sickest bass in all of history.
The music slaps
I love you guys!
I'm here to thumbs up and comment so the video gets interaction and gets boosted by the alhorithm because I don't have an hour rn and I know I'll put it in my watch later for a couple weeks but I'LL GET TO IT EVENTUALLY I PROMISE-
0:23 wow~
The algae that invented sex 1.2 Billion years ago was named Bangiomorpha Pubescens. Scientists literally put the words BANG and PUBES in its name. That's some insane trolling.
If I ever get a coma then play this video thanks
18:00  ~taste the SUNNNN
This is so impressive, I cannot even form a proper sentence in my head!!! Best f***ing video you`ve ever made!!! Keep up the good work!
W animator+voice actor guy
Not only am I watching…. I AM DAD DANCING!!!! (Embarrassing the kids) I’d love to see a version of this with Mars. See a moment in time when life was possible before she died out 😢
126144000 is 4 years, in seconds. so it took 189,216,000,000,000 years to make this video. one hundred eighty-nine trillion two hundred sixteen billion years.
It's true what they say. Time really does fly when you are having fun
Amazing video and btw not enough comments on the music. THE MUSICCCCCCC.
You can easily notice that the distance between each timestamp is getting shorter and shorter due to more knowledge available about recent geological periods.  Great job, keep doing such great things!)
This is probably gonna be the longest poster in the world
I love the way the natural sounds are mixed with the music
ngl, it was an interesting video, but you explained like literally nothing. This was more like a slideshow animation with sporadic commentary. I hardly really learned anything that I thought would have been explained. A bit dissapointed tbh
crap i just started watching, this is gonna take a while
This whole video is nonsense
I really love this format.
That change in beat going into the Mesoarchean was beautiful! It gave me some doom vibes, which goes perfectly with the atmospheric conditions of the time.
This is why I like Kurzgesagt
This! This is what YouTube actually exists for. Incredible! Will rewatch regularly, it's such a meditation! Also, big props to EpicMountain, the OST is worthy of 4.5 billions of years of history!
Nah. So you've drawn a bunch of shiny moving blobs and call it a history.. Hipnotic art perhaps, but that's not how scientists see the world. How about instead of narration add some persistent infographics: the gas content of atmosphere, pressure, surface temperature, amount of surface water, count of single cell species, multicellular species..  You say humans won't survive? How about writing how long would a human survive in such conditions?
amazing, thank you!
How many of you immediately thinked about Bill Wurtz?😂
Stenian Era my favorite. 😂
LOL this is a playlist tracked to the entire history of earth.
Wow
The gigachads who watched the whole thing actively, not in the background:
love the art style!
Thanks Kurzgesagt, for making this 1 hour animated documentary of our Earth’s History for free. I’ve been following your channel since 2015 and always love the consistent improvement in your videos and the animations. Hope this video gets at least 10 million views in no time!
Truly goat 🐐🐐
amazing job guys
And that one tick is us......
Took me around 17 million years to write this.
HOW DO YOU HAVE THIS MUCH PATIENCE FOR ANIMATIN?
Took me half a billion years to eat ma bacon ham sandvitch
still not as old as my parents
Did I just miss the tardis or it hasn't been in the video?
It's so surreal that even though we were here for only a fraction of a second, we basically have this giant space rock at the palm of our hands
Thanks für this video ❤
The music is feels very terraria. A wonderful informative video and a great wave of nostalgia :)
he he NO, Earth is around 6000 years old created by GOD nothing evolved, it was jus created this way then when ppl sinned it was adapted so we still have a chance of living
That's the history of the entire world I guess
1 HOUR of Kurzgesagt? Must watch!
ok i may burn to death but damn the mesoarchean era looks beautiful like the water even sparkles
I played this at 5x the speed to get ahead of the competition!
I did some research and one of the main theories is that the water on earth was brought by a comet after the hadean stage....
This was the best hour of my day.  Thank you
how can you present the hadean era as volcanic, hot hell while acknowledging the zircons found from that time? the evidence of liquid water directly contradicts the past theory of hellish burning earth!
no way
from the
nobodys gonna talk about how good the music is? damn props to the team on that!
It was beautiful....
45:08 They might've invented sex
Remember, it all started from a rock that simply decided to become alive.
Those cyanobacteria were some gnarly life forms! They survived in a primordial soup with no oxygen in a superheated environment and probably ate the most corrosive putrid things and pooped out oxygen. Now we're here. Life is remarkably resilient
Guys 7 days
great! little lazy at some early time points and interpretations... but scale wise so good!
This isn't a documentary,  it's a dance track!!  And an awesome one!! This would be great pumping in a night club with a projector
Loved every second of the video
>16 hours ago >1M+ views  insane behaviour
"Every 60 seconds in Africa,a minute passes"
THIS IS THE MOST INCREADIBL THING I'VE SEEN IN 2023 gj
How as almost nobody mentioned the excellent soundtrack? The music rocks!
I’m assuming that Epic Mountain is behind this epic soundtrack 😎
What an amazing job you've all done!  I love the music score, especially the odd timing around 1.8M yo ;)
4.5 billions of sheer faith, within 1h of lies.
This video is just amazing!
is this procedurally generated?
i LOVE THIS VIDEO SOOO MUCH WOW KURZGEZGT WOW
I watched this in 4k!
This is sooo amazing! I wish this could be my hour long screen saver!
An hour of the earth's history and only a tiny bit of it was human's history. Barely a few seconds. It's amazing
This is sooooooooooooooo good
I need a whole playlist of this. Just chill music periodically interrupted by some interesting fact or another lol.
Thanks very much sir it made my life and my mood better.this journey is amazing
LoFi Evolution To Study To. 🎶🦖
Great stuff, love it!
amazing
The music is awesome in this, a 1 hour set of _Kurzgesagt beats to relax/study to_ basically. Is this on Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal?
A moment to just admire just how great the @kurzgesagt team is. Their content is amazing, beautiful and free. Thank you.
When a 1 hour video is too long for your attention span:
Lets just take a moment to appreciate this work of art 🎉
Love the score .
Kurzgesagt you guys just keeps on impressing us - so thankful I found you!
Lol i read a comment that says i love kurzgesagt, and i found out that it means "in short" in english cuz of google translate XD it's rly cool cuz that rly is the main point of this channel, which is why i love it so much X3
"I had been there the whole time" said the almighty -od
Old school in da house!!!
this is  amazing
Every masterpiece: history of the entire world I guess Has it's cheap copy:
My wife and I talk about how cool it would be to be able to have a 'Lucy' style photographic memory of all of history, including the planets formation.  I think this is the closest we can get.  Thank you so much for your hard work!
Naaa this makes me think, let's not think about this and have questions. God did it all, see no more thinking needed, life is easy again.
The drum beat drop is funky
I have to say this video is one of the reasons why I really appreciate being alive in this era. A hundred years ago scientists are still trying to figure out where all these water came from, how Earth came to be etc. Today we can tell the entire story almost accurately, damn we even have an idea what's happening inside the sun while people before worshipped it as a GOD. We can even make videos like these that can show us events that unfolded billions of years ago.   These are the reasons why I'm a person that never gets bored. There is just so much to learn to discover and places to go to. A human lifetime is just not enough to appreciate all of these. thats why when my cousin took his own life I just don't understand it. He just kept saying he cant find a purpose or excitement about being alive. Perhaps he just simply did not open his mind maybe that's why he can appreciate anything or maybe he was just really sick and what his doing is just making everything worst. In my experience purpose and happiness is not something you look for bcoz you won't find it. It's a result of you being able to appreciate even the smallest of things in your life or in this world.
This is amazing. I can't imagine the amount of work that must have gone into it. Thank you!
First time watching documentary and came
Amazing video!
Can't imagine the amount of efforts put into this masterpiece Amazing work, and the fact that we get to see it for free is insane
Amazing video. Thank you for this epic hour❤. You guys deliver every time. We all are greatfull. Please keep it up. Again thank you for your hard work.
I speak on the behalf of the internet here. Thank you for existing.
Beautiful.
imagine having this as desktop background
Wallpaper Engine please.
The transition from one era to another could've been better... Right now it seems like there was era 1 till X year and then suddenly the next day the era 2 starts
1 fkn hour of earths history and the last 1 second was the humans history. surely we think so big of ourselves... thank you for this beautiful video
this would be a fire geometry dash level
That was beautiful.
Kurzgesagt is basically bbc but animated
The video falls short in terms of both its informational content and its graphic quality. A duration of less than 5 minutes would have sufficed.
Wow. If only they had shown this at school.
i love this SO much omg <3 super cool!
good work for the camera man who filmed it for 4.5 billion years.
🔥🔥🔥
wow this is really big project
Amazing
Great video, quick question  does the speed of which the planet rotates have an effect on rate of evolution of life on earth
That was a very enjoyable hour I just spent, thank you.
I loved this soundtrack! And obviously the video as a whole :D
Does this mean  mammals are anti-meteorites?
I greatly appreciate channels like this. It takes a lot of creativity and passion to create videos like this. All the effort for a simple background video while I play D2R.   Thanks to the Kurzgesagt team!
Human evolution on earth in 5 seconds: *B Y E B Y E*
YO 1 HOUR
bilon
더 빠르게 지구의 변천과정을 보는 방법: 2배속
This is the most insanely good video out there!❤
You completed it just in time for the 4.5 billionth birthday of Earth :p
LoFi Girl is crying right now, her job is gone
Damn, I blinked. Gotta watch the whole thing from the start.
scew lofi music this is better
That was brutal.
You guys are insane!! An hour long video, animations, scripts, voices, editing... Damn
Sick Soundtrack👍 and very nice Video!
That is so incredible project. I can't express how I was amazed even on my native language. My greatest gratitude for your great work!
Respect for the animators
The music is mystical.
I love and appreciate this so much lol!
6:50 "Earth is smashed for several hundred millon years" 💀💀💀
This reminded me a lot of the Dreamcast game ‘Rez’
Can we please give the deserved credit also to the music and sound design team!? One hour of  amazing soundtrack!!! 😎
😂❤
The attention to detail is amazing. I love how the "camera" has little bits of water vapour on it during the lava bit.
Such an amazing video!
I loved this concept idea. Good job
im 30 seconds in and i can already tell this is ABSOLUTELY FENOMENAL EPIC SOUND DESIGN
i was watching this high yesterday and that was the most weird experience ive ever had
This will look so awesome with vr
Lol I blinked and didn't witness the human history. What a shame😂
Super fun=)
The editor is a huge Tool fan For sure
This videos is baffeling me, never would have have i ever imagined that dinosaurs were so recent in the history of the eart
I haven’t even started the video but knowing Kurzgesagt this video is going to be insane. 1 hour special! Amazing!
Einfach nur WOW!
LOL at the second stage when it was ending and perfectly when the lightning appeared on the screen I got an ad LOL that timing ( it was somewhere here 12:39 )
Damn I didn't know the early moments of our earth had such a nice soundtrack constantly playing in the background
Well made but quit being so certain of unverified information. Everything here aside from recorded history is theory, never forget that.
Would gladly pay for more!
The banger music 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
1:01:50 The tail end theme
How cool would it be if we could watch this in a VR headset or at a planetarium!
Nobody's talking about the music that's went into gluing us to this!! Absolute love! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
im leaving a comment for the algorithm, amazing video.
A lifetime is everything and nothing at the same time🩷
Yo Neoarchean and Siderian goes hard ngl
Longest Kurzgesagt video I know of
this is so cool omg
This is stupendously astoundingly fantastically cool.
55:39 the species are moving so slow xddd so slow million years xddd
Better than any uni lecture
58:12 the ancestors of the birds do bird things 😂
Best thing for everything.
Props to whoever made the music I just dropped my phone on my face from falling asleep.
It takes 53 minutes of a 1 hour video for the Cambrian explosion to happen. Absolutely mind boggling
What an eye opening experience. Without a doubt.
Just wow I Watched this till the end what a phenomenal documentary
The music in this video sounds a lot like Terraria style music
Props to the scientist, the animator, and Kurzgesagt to travel to 4b y ago to make this animation possible to us. 👏
As someone over 30 years old, I remember a lot of this.
This video was insanely beautiful.
i love this thank you
Kurzgesagt The Movie 🎥🍿 SWEET!!!
4.5 billion views in one hour.
Amazing video, only to have absolute parasites like xQc "react" to this and get free money off of it.   His "reaction", by the way, will be him not paying attention to shit because of his ADHD, not understanding shit because he dropped out of school, and he wont even be present for more than 20 minutes without disappearing while letting this video play in the background.   When xQc and sniperwolf react to this series, I sincerely hope you sue them till they go bankrupt.
bill wurtz: Finally! A worthy opponent!
This is just impressive, thank you
Big thanks to camera man 🙏
Can't imagine how much work went into this, but it's truly awesome
😊❤️ love It!!!
Jaw droppingly good
hey i just noticed your doing 4k60 now. ever since the korea video im seeing now. i appreciate this. not sure if you "just" upscaled everything or your now are animating with a lot more detail but itrs nice to see eitherway.
I didn't realize the Cambrian period and complex multicellular life came along that late in the game. It really lets you wrap your mind around the scale of time.
more like 4.5 Billion Years in 30 minutes
One asteroid falling for five million years. My grandma can fall faster down the stairs
so in one second we are crossing 48000 generations of humans(25 year per generation) Thats crazy
I'm not sure what's up, but a bunch of my favorite content creators have made hour plus videos lately..  Honestly I often don't get around to them, because I see how long they are, and just don't have/want to take that large chunk of my day to dedicate to them... This one at least, I could let run in the background, while doing other things, but the primary reason I even tried was to support kurzgesagt..
Hey bro where you at rn? Uh… the mesosrchian time period?
Amazing!! Always love it when you guys create videos like these! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🪐
I suddenly feel old, irrelevant and tiny. At the same time, amazed of what happened so far. And sad of what we have done to earth. Despite all that, inspired to draw and write something.
I am amazed by thinking about the passion and dedication required to make this video. This is like an album or memory book for planet earth. Although I would love, if it contained more explanation of various events.
this type of video is what humanity needs
I really like that amost all the ages names are greek <3
Kurzgesagt this is your best video yet 😊 I love this
now think about how lucky you are to be born in an advanced society
AN HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO WOOOHOOOOOO
1:00:39 "Don't blink or you might miss all of human history!" Ads : bonjour~
I love it but I'd like to see a second version made in a next years. Here are some suggestions:  1. Talk about when the heavy metals started sinking to form the core and the magnetic field. 2. The moon used to spin initially, it got tidally locked over time 3. Talk about how the oxidation event was also the first mass extinction wiping out nearly all of anerobic life.
Fake
Most of the earth's life has been of no intelligent life. Humans have barely existed  💀
That is awesome !
Wow, the music in this is giving me memories from my Sega Genesis days! Heh
Here before this Masterpiece absolutely blows up.
It felt like a snap of time
Humans only got 1 second of screentime 😊 It's amazing to know our earth is sooooo ancient
Can we have this as a wallpaper engine wallpaper???
i love the different genres of music in here omggg
Is there a glitch at 29:43? I am fairly certain it is not my computer.
Wouldve been nice to be able to select no background music
This video is such a vibe!! i watched it while doing my homework... will recommend to others
Ngl i feel bad for the dinosaurs dying like if time travel was invented i might visit that place but like last because its the most dangerous age so yeah and with weopons of course
This is what a Loading screen should be
@vsauce
This is movie level of effort! Congratulations to the team for creating this masterpiece!
Speedrun any%
I'd like to give a special thanks to the camera man, for recording 4.5 billion years here. Inspirational.
It'd be cool to see how the moon, once separated actually starts to orbit Earth. Then by sucking orbital velocity from Earth, slow it down, moving further away and becoming locked in orbit eventually.
Thank you, Kurzgesagt, that was beautiful
Who made the music? It's FIRE! (Like me LOL)
Your life (if you are lucky to become 80) will last 0,00006 seconds of this video.
You're on a rock, floating in space
I listened to this to fall asleep and I only made it to Eoarchean 😊 It's good to know I still have billions of years left to fall asleep to 😂
some animation errors with the asteroids at 10:33
sorry boss but someone already sumed it all up in under 20 min and included all of human history.
A one hour Kurzgesagt video is a bigger treat than all the candy I've gathered in 24 years of experiencing Halloween. Always look forward to these uploads!
Great video as always, but a small mistake in the night sky of the Cretaceous at 58:48. The bright side of a crescent moon should always be facing down because the Sun is under the horizon. The crescent moon should look like this 🌜.
Kurzgesagt just drops world's first epoch opera
More videos like this pleeeease! You guys blew it out of the park!
What a great travel through time👍
this is a masterpiece
shout out to the homie that made an hour long/4.5 billion year long song
Deep time is so crazy. None of us live long enough to understand it, we can only conceptualize it
A ONE HOUR Kurzgesagt video?!!?!!? Whatttttttttttttttttttttttttt!!!!
Now do one for 4.5 billion years in the future :)
My wish list for kurzgesagt:  - I would like to learn more about mass extinctions - How about one video for each era after the Cambrian explosion (Devon, Silur, Jura, Trias etc.)
This is why I’ll buy any merch you guys put out! Love to know it’s going into quality content! ❤❤
Face reveal 🎉
Props to the camera crew for walking towards the right for 4.5 billion years
Mesoarchean didn’t deserve to go so hard 🔥 🔥
Great work!
I love it sooooooooooooooooooooo much.
Longest Kurgesagt video ever wow.
For free ?
i didn't know that there is someone from poland!!!   1:03:10     Łukasz Buda                 btw i'm from poland
This was awsome.. even after 10 million years I still did not finish editing my video :(
Honestly, if VR does becomes the new norm and really takes off. I'll gladly pay a yearly membership to visit a virtual Kurzgesagt Museum dedicated to all things existential and scientific. It's a way cheaper option than building one IRL and if done right would be more immersive and hard-hitting than even your very well animated YouTube videos. You've already partnered with Meta to make one virtual experience. Why not make a whole museum if given the chance? Of course, this is all speculative and imaginary but I think it's a pretty decent idea.
Insane video. Let's also appreciate the music in this animation! Well done
Props to the cameraman who recorded it for Billions of years
This must be in a museum of natural science, or art, or both!
Great video, good job
really makes life seem pretty pointless
Great video for hangover comas
48:00 loving the EDM Tool fusion going on.
Smoking on that Thiea moon pack learning shi and listening to the jammy tunes. Love this!
Way too much dead air
This is my most favorite channel on YouTube. But this time you guys have outdone yourself!  Thank you so much for your continued efforts for making this world a knowledgeable place, one video at a time.
This video changed my viewe fo the World, cant wait for the german translation so i can send it to my parents
Here
I love the description 😭 "Earth is 4.5 billion years old - which is approximately the same amount of time it took us to create this video."
Wow.
I am so sory for the animators 🪦RIP Kurzgeasagtanimators  ????-2023🪦
‘We are still in the lava stage ‘ My honest reaction : 🕺🕺🕺
What a soundtrack.. this is why I really have it open it in the background haha.
34:03 thats 2023 million years ago
Even though this isn’t how I would present this info (I’d do infographics instead of time) I watched it all the way through in the background while I did some chores.  Thank you for trying this experiment! Awesome stuff as usual
ah yes, my favourite existential crisis videos are back, nice work on this one!
This is a master piece!!! I m gonna watch this with my daughter for our weekend🤩
In this time scale, human civilization last for only 3 miliseconds and a country of United States of America lasts for only 0.13 milliseconds.
Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 💖💖💖
It's so wonderful to see an animation simulating the whole geologic timescale. Gotta call it a masterpiece, and appreciate the Kurz team for their time and effort.
I am loving this! ❤ Awesome job!
Sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago.
Brava!
This is tremendous amount of work. Love it. Would be great if you made similar animation that shows both sides of earth from above through its history
19:41 heard that distorted guitar come in and knew it was gonna be good
This whole video is just making me angry and stabby. It's tearing into as bad the perishingly few things that actually do work in the US "healthcare system", while owning zero of the idiocy.... "I also never got a COVID vaccine"...."I took the drugs in the exact opposite way the very clear directions on the bottle said"....."we've tried everything short of modem western medicine we don't understand why we're not getting better"
I find it funny that my fave content seems to be super long form content @CountDankula some of tiktok is good, but it's mostly just slop people throw together for a click or posting for attention
NO. THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER    Ops, wrong video.
Nice video
this is perfect, I'm going to use it as the bedtime story 😂 10/10
The existential dread when you do the math and realize that the entire human history doesn't even fill one frame of this 1 hour long 60 fps video right at the start of it.
Damn I blinked :(
Now do the universe
29:44 Anyone else catch these occasional glitches throughout the video or is it just my monitor? I think there's something bigger than just 4.5 billiom years condensed to an hour. But then again, I might just be too deep in the indie ARG community to just not think anything out of the ordinary is a minor mistake.
This is all our history. Our real history
I like how nobody is changing the twitter logo to X. 1:03:21
Big shout out to the cameraman who filmed all of the first 4,500,000,000 years in the making. This couldn't have happen without you.
Whats the song during Hadean ?
Hmm.. lot of loops, both image and music. Not that impressive. I’d expect more deep understanding of the processes, instead of “now there are fungi, doing fungi stuff”. Well.. I maybe shouldn’t expect more of you. You’re not in this for the education, just the entertainment, right?
In before one billion views.
"Don't blink" really brings perspective of how short the history of man is
This is gonna be a classic!
all off the lies
51:24  We're not sure. *Captain America theme intensifies* 😂
Everyone better like this video(and comment bc it might give me money) bc this animation is actually insane
Pretty dope shit
Props to the camera man for sticking along for 4.5 billion years
The insane amount of time and effort it must've taken to compose a 1 hour long song that sounds this good is beyond me. Well done
I know we're all admiring the animation, but let's not also forget the banger music! Wouldn't have been able to sit here for 1 hour without it!
13:48 90% of people just clicked off by this point because of attention spans smaller than gold fish(this is not a joke by the way, they are almost nonexistent), so if you made it here, congratulations!
❤❤❤
This video enamored my cat… oh and I was too!😁
In the hour it took between starting and finishing this, the Likes went from 140k to 145k.
This made me feel so many emotions, I think this is one of my favourite videos on YouTube.
Future videos should obviously be The History of Humanity in 1 Hour (i.e. stretch out that last second or two) and then The history of Civilization in 1 Hour (stretch out the last second of the previous video), to really drive home about the magnitudes of time passed.
Wow. Amazing video. Still can’t figure out where the first millions of rain came exactly from 🫣 it was just there? 🤯
35:25 was great jams
your best video, by far. good job! awesome music as well. didn't skip a beat :)
someone gotta mod these early earth landscapes into planets in starfield
If I pause the video will it pause time?
*weather forecast today indicates it'll be a rainy week and a another rainy couple of hundres of years*
All this time to finally get fat people who believe in fictional characters
Fungi started widespreading and doing.. fungi stuff :o
I fell asleep, not out of boredom, but from the fantastic scenery and music chosen for this amazing video. Definitely will share this and consider buying merch to see more of this!
Wow
We know that the ads already takes millions of years~
I was having a hard day when I saw this. I think it helped put some things in perspective, not least of which because it made for a great background for some mindfulness. I feel better now and I think I can go forward with a clear head. Thank you!
I hope a music only version of this will be uploaded some day
One hour long video from Kurzgt... I'm blushing.  I'll save this to watch when I have free time.  I do not care in what direction you took this, I just simply love you guys so much and will soak up every video you make.  Very excited for this one when I have free time.
I wonder what excuse can anyone use to hate on kurzgesagt?
Wurtzgesagt? ah, no jingles tho.
really long watched it in less than 20min
FOR FREE?!
Isn’t pretty much every animal in the Triassic period not a Dino
I love it it's so cool ❤❤❤
i felt like a dinosaur
this is fucking amazing. kurzt u the best!
Are there plans to make this into a downloadable live wallpaper? Or segmented into multiple, like one for each era? It'd be really neat to have on an idle desktop
Drums on Tonian period amazing
I feel young.
what about when the ocean became red before the huronian ice age?
Today is my birthday and I woke up with this, nice start of the day ❤
in the neoarchean the water surface looks like a cell doing meiosis 🤔👀
This video was beautiful man, it made me feel grateful and have this sense of childlike wonder again that for so much of the Earth's history it was just nothing but rocks, lava and water, and then in a relatively small time, so much life just bloomed in all these different stages. It's amazing
script writers had a day off? or?
...how th did you do this
just wanna say. i chose not to skip ads in this 🫡 was just too dang good
2.6 Million years ago first ad was invented
Not sure how this could possibly take 4 years to make.
*pure character development in the video and on this channel*
This is easily one of the absolute fuckin COOLEST things you guys have ever done. And you already always manage to blow my mind with your 10-30 minute videos.   Absolutely a masterpiece, guys! Bravo ❤️
That was great! I was groovin to the music the whole time lol
About 17 1/2 minutes in so far...excited to see the last frame or 2 of the video that shows the entirety of human history!
1h00 video best day ever
What amazes me the most is that every single atom of our own body has experienced all this and has been now combined into a mass that is able to watch and appreciate this form of art.
i freaking blinked! 😭
It’s almost eoy… and this is the best I’ve seen so far.
Its so beautiful I have tears🥺
44:50 big shoutout to the bangiomorpha pubescens, sex is awesome and we owe it all to the algae
This video has the best soundtrack yet! Fighting!
longest Video....❤
Time indeed works differently on Kurzgesagt
The animator needs a raise because of animating this 1hour ride just to entertain us. I wonder how long it takes to animate this.
I almost never comment on videos but goddamn this is awesome
What an impressive work!! You are the best YouTube channel for sure! Thank you for this really interesting content 🙂
Best I waited and this is still quality!
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE OCEANS WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥
This is a masterpiece!
i watched this all in one sitting
bro missed the part when i bagged a 10
Props to Cameraman for surviving major apocalypses to provide us this video
Dear Kurzgesagt, I watched the whole movie ❤
Yooooo
Bangiomorphia Pubescens - the name for the algae that invented sex - really scientists? Really?
This is gonna be my screensaver lol
I love how DOOM-ish the music gets in the Mesoarchean era
Global freezing: The temperature balance is so keen and our existence is so amazing. 30:05 1st 51:10 2nd 52:05 3rd
comment your favorite era, mine are the Siderian, Rhyacian, Ectasian, Ediacaran, Devonian, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Neogene!
I've been stuck on the toilet seat for 4.5 billion years.
Wild. Unique.
45:03
In Christianity they teach the children that the earth and solar systems was created in 7 days because there is a total of 7 days in a week in our calendar, but the history tells that the creation of the seven-day week is a result of a historical and cultural evolution, with contributions from ancient civilizations, religious texts, and astronomical observations.
Always the best. Love ya
I was hoping for something more focusing on human history alongside the holocene calender but I'm not going to lie this was nice too
Thank you!❤
The songs goes hard in this video
Yo this sound track slaps, my guys.
amazing work all
great work guys! but can u tell me how accurate this really is
Oh no! I've blinked! And all of humanity is gone now 😮
The truly astonishing thing, more than the video itself, is that the ages progress regularly: as with every other chapter of history, we tend to see farther events passing faster. This video has done its best to show us how small a fraction of Earth’s life we have occupied so far
This is the kind of project the client would give me after getting hired
Oh my goodness what a gorgeous gift from kurzgesagt i can feel the labor of love put into this, the planning, animation, editing, all of it holy moly
50:24 I love Big boy Euykaryotes and tiny armor
Rad.  The whole movie I was hoping you'd stick to your science guns and not slow time down for humans.  Not disappointed.
Amazing. I watched the whole entire thing and i was completely enamoured by it all. Thank you Kurzgesagt!
Can this win the YouTube award for best YouTube on YouTube, please?
🐐ed
I can finally say I have enough patience to wait a billion years
Big shout-out to Bangiomorpha pubescens for that whole "sex invention" thing 👍  Also, I don't know if I've ever seen a more appropriate scientific name for anything ever 😅
WORST VIDEO EVER. I love this channel but this video was complete waste. it had no substance. just random animations with sound. i expected a masterpiece in 1 hour but disappointed a lot. disliked
Thanks ❤❤❤
So the water I drink right now is 3.9 Billion years old?
A 1 hour kurzgesagt Video! Christmas sure as hell came early.
Well there goes me for the next hour. So grateful to this channel for all the hard work
Oh dang, this hour isn't a metaphor.  Here we go!
and I explain this to them they said: You think too much! And I reply: you all think too little.
wow. just.. wow.... thank you so much kurzgesagt for making such a masterpiece of animation, the time and dedication just put into this one video for everyone else to see. ive been watching the channel since 2016 and im so happy that ive gotten to see the channel develop and eventually become one of the biggest youtube channels today.  thanks to everyone on the team, kurzgesagt, you inspire people all around the world.  from a fan
I was on my phone and after a while, I need to do other thing. So I pressed home to go out of YT and I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE VIDEO STILL PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND INSIDE A SMALL WINDOW!  Never experience this before. Kurzgesagt truly stick to what they said in the beginning to just set this video in the background 😮 PROPS!
Man, the Mesoarchean djents apparently…..
But we know that sun is a deadly laser
It's so lucky that the formation of the Moon was right before the later heavy boom period. Otherwise water would not exist on Earth.
awesome🎉!🎉
Damn! I now get you guys didnt upload for quite some time! Impressive! Keep it up! :)
We gonna eat good fr
I've been procrastinating for 4.5 billion years. Thanks, Kurzgesagt!
The watch time on this video is going to abysmal
🐐🐐🐐
I first thought this was a great idea, but I am now 35 minutes in and I haven't learned all that much. It is very lazily animated as well. Like you say a very large asteroid crashes into earth, but you don't show it at all.. what the hell?
Perfect thing to watch to help wind my brain down from a long day of major brain usage
it took me 30 miillion years to reed thes comments
This as a live wallpaper
Wow I absolutely adore this video. The animation is spectaclur, but also, I hope one day someone will do a CGI photorealistic version
Huge ups for those algae in the stenian
This will be my go to video whenever I want to experience trance visuals 😵‍💫
Not gonna lie, every frames is worthy of being a wallpaper
history of the entire world, i guess v.2
4 years of work condensed in an hour master piece. I loved it.
this is so dumb.
This is some awesome art  Must have taken an year to animate this, and they still gave it for free, i feel grateful
THIS IS HANDS DOWN ONE OF TREASURES IN YOUTUBE LATELY... got me emotional!! Happy Anniversary Kurzgesagt!
I'm not saying it's bad. It's really good and must have taken a lot of time but 9:40 the gaps in the puddles seem to move with the camera. 😀
I love this
One of the best channels on youtube. Thanks for all that you do.
The best hour on YouTube
This is officially the best video on Youtube now i don't make the rules
I love thos Chanel
Gotta watch the whole thing!!
Love the details
Cfbr
Girlfriend: Hey can we FaceTime tonight? Me: Sorry babe, new kurzgesagt dropped!
Wow! I never expected to see our earth evolution like this! Great work, Kurzgesagt team!
1 / 1500000 = 6.66666667e-7  seconds  to  nanosecond  is  666.67  for  1  year
The Kraftwerkian beat is sick!
What a trip!
Now we just need a Wallpaper Engine version with adjustable speed!
19:57 anyone else think the music here sounds like Dream Theater a little? like it belongs in Octavarium or something
sort of reminds me of Carl Sagan's cosmic calendar, with the last 10 seconds of the year having all of human history in it.
How many MYA did they start animating this? 🙂 Love the soundtrack, this is brilliant!
Who cares if porn is free? This right here is the real miracle.
Damn the Orosirian age really goes hard at about 35:15
”Might have invented sex”💀45:02
Sex invented at 44:53
I'm impressed y'all made a very fitting soundtrack to the history of life...and, y'know, a whole animation to go along with it. I'll bet this took forever, this is wild.
My favorite thing about Kurzgesagt is when they remake their time video and each time it gets better
So 1,000 years is like 0.00002222 % of Earths time and we are out here stressing about little things
fascinating
Really well done, thanks!
This deserves 1M views this needs 10B views  it had alot of time made into it
It's interesting that all the animals on earth today are dinosaurs, but smaller.
Humanity took only a small fraction of time to fuktup everything.
it's so unusual
"Bro only 1 mil views?!?! This is insane! Definitely deserves more!" Checks upload date: 13 hours ago... ah makes sense
existential crisis time! 🍿
Holy shit
New favorite video of all time. Thanks.
1 second = 47,300,000,000,000 seconds
guys i think it's false, this guy wasnt born 4.5 billion years ago, how does he know what happened?
Thanks for the video! Now I know what history was the history of our blue planet was like in stunning detsil and I don't have to die of old age thinking about it! Jokes aside, I  really appreciate the video and hard work! I'm looking forward to your continued success. Once again, thank you.
Massive props too you guys, a hour video must of taken ages
Great video! Really appreciate tue jurassic park reference in the jurassic period 😂
The best soundtrack ever.
The music makes me feel like im grinding terraria again
Man, I wish I were still teaching geography! This would've been broken up into a good few lessons to present~ Thank you, everyone on this team's channel!
Why doesn't the top counter day billions of years it just says 5 million years
The last second of this video is overated
"1.2 billion years ago, sex was invented." - Kurzgesagt
Whoa. An hour of Kurzgesagt? What in the world did we do to deserve this? 😭 TYSM!
I've waited for this for sooo long I love your videos they were apart of my childhood and they're amazing intertaning and education
TIL Tool released their first song during the Mesoarchean period
Lmao, I lost it when he said something like "1.2 billion years ago not that much is going on, except some aglae Bangomorphus Pubertatis might have invented sex." Hats off to those chads, boys
I can't believe i went through the entire video😂
this is a masterpiece
Congrats to kurzgesagt for travelling back in time 4.5 billion years ago 🔥🔥🔥
Thanks to the cameraman and historian who took out 4.5 Billion years of his time to record all these events for us.
This music is awesome
❤❤❤
This is the crash course for all aliens who wanna visit earth.
Watched the whole thing amazing
Holyyyy...... 😮😮😮😮😮
this pretty much puts it in perspective
Who would've thought a merge of Friday-Nite MTV PartyZone with Nat-Geo themes could be so EPIC? 😃😃😃
Awesome
the advertsiement comes just after lightening strike across the screen ;;;;; wow
cant wait for the update video in a few million years
Well... I'm speechless. But then, of course the Germans would produce another incredible hour-long progressive trance mix with absolutely amazing video to go with it. The music, the art, the narration, the flow - it's stunning.
Wow, so much animation and time spent on such an awesome video. Absolutely outstanding!
Not trying to be a 🍆, but this isn't something I want to see more than once.
I enjoyed the reference to Jeff Goldbum in Jurrassic Park with the line "life um... finds a way". Well done :)
That is some banging music choice! Love it!
Kurzgesagt makes art out of science 💕
Next up 24/7 live stream I would like it,
So this is what y’all have been working on… I will watch all of this
If you think about it, this video took 4.5 billion years to make.
Love the video. Makes me sad and happy at the same time.
Great video
쿠르츠게작트 정말 대단해요🥲 항상 감사합니다..
watched this while crocheting - i only managed to finish half a scarf in 4 billion years 😔😔
Who knew that the earth had such a badass soundtrack that could only be perceived by speeding things up by a few hundred billion times...
Never expect this' get animated, i thought it was a live podcast
Congrats to anyone who watched this video for 4.5 billion years
The music absolutely didn't have to go this hard, but we just got like 1 hour of mad good musical vibes for free. Moments that reminded me of Tool, and some great piano/choral stuff towards the end. Huge kudos to the person/people who put together the music for this video, I enjoyed it immensely 🎶
Im so proud of being with you for 10years
I know they were going for a scenic and minimalist thing here, but I would absolutely love the exact same video but jamb packed with as much meaningful and useful info as possible. This would also give them 10x the stuff to work from, graphics wise. I'm sure it would be a herculean effort, even more so than this was, but, man, can I tell you, I would be ALL over that.
58:12 Ha!
History was made the day history was made, thank you, in a nutshell.
Usually your videos are like 20 minutes at most. The fact that this is an hour is insane. Nice job.
Hey what about the 2thou....trillion year reighn of the Roman empire ?
I finally found wallpaper for my desktop
Kutgestag the movie!
Omg!!! Omg!!!! The music of this was pure masterpiece!!!! ❤❤❤ The animation was so stellar! Thank you so much!!!!!
Talk about running out of content. This could have been a 20 minute video but they decided let's do it 1 hour so we can have ad rolls.
Genuinely this was insane!!! Hugeeee W, thank you kurzgesagt
Happy Birthday Kurzgesagt! Can't believe you're 45 billion years old already!
Damn nice job yall did amazing I hope we get to see more of this. This channel is the only channel that I learn everyday without getting bored thx yall
You are amazing…  thanks Kurzgesagt!
One of the best videos I ever seen on YouTube! Great concept I enjoyed every second of it !
loved and shared. Keep it up
I love how every single piece is animated, like when the asteroids fall down to hedean, it actually shows effect(explosion)
It only takes a species of creature with less than a million year of history to destroy a planet accumulated through billions of years.  I am just going to assume mankind is actually invasive species sent from outer space.
Greatest masterpiece ever I have seen on YouTube ❤
What a beautiful video. Thanks Kurzgesagt. 💪
Bro be like: a huge asteroid killed almost everyone on earth, sucha bummer- in the calmest way possible
What a ride. I can see why this would have taken so long. Will we persist or are we doomed to be a blip on the geological radar? Only time will tell
Holy shit a 1 hour kurzgesagt video, i fukin kneel.
Brilliant. Love it.
A great video to watch high
42:06 Ectasian theme sounds quite a bit like one of the songs from hollow knight ost? Cant remember which one specifically, maybe greenpath? Idk Edit: its Crystal Peak!!!
Tool wrote the Stenian and Tonian tracks, no doubt...
OMG !! You amaze me Respect kuzgestat team from my ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ you work so hard. ❤❤❤ Love you work. ❤❤❤
ابدااع 👏🏻
Definitely felt something 1:02:08
Has anyone else watched this twice already?
At 29:40, it says CO2 and methane's effect on the atmo was to cool the planet down.  Say what?
I would love to have one of this for each specific period where you go more indepth
I'll show this to my kids one day.
This is yes
amazing
The music was superb all the way through
I love everything about this video.
I'll use this video as a documentary for my students in middle class. Thankyou for the amazing content you always give us
I’m gonna play this at parties.
Gyat dam the music 🎶
I love you guys so much ❤
Damn! 44 minutes of nothing..... 😮
Txs a lot for that video, nice experience. You could add more infos like global temperature, spin, duration of a day, O2 lvl... like a dashboard, it would look fantastic with your creative designs. ❤
Things really do change so quickly. What’s the next 50million years going to look like 1:00:24
This was a gorgeous production from the visuals to the amazing music, and even all the birbs at the end.  Thank you everyone involved in making it!
This is incredible...just amazing and i feels so small after watching the whole evolution. ❤❤❤
Fresh!
Talk about Long-Form Content!
an hour of kurzgesagt? this is gonna be epic boys
Yayy a kurzgesagt movie
....the beauty of this video made me start crying. I have adhd and this video kept my attention for nearly it's entire runtime.  It is a masterpiece.
It’s all so beautiful 59:18
You all have outdone yourselves with this video! This one's going to be on repeat in the background for billions of years to come.
This video was fantastic! I loved all the animation, and the music was wonderful but… I would have liked more spoken word :( Like, a lot more.   I’ve watched a lot of videos about the subjects already, but I wanted to hear you tell me again in more detail than you gave about how asteroids bombarded the molten planet, rain poured down for millions of years, etc while I watch the beautiful animations and listen to the lovely music.  I’m very grateful for what you’ve shared with us! I’d be thrilled by a second addition with more dialogue, though. No need to change any of the animations which are so painstaking to make; just put together some more descriptions and slap some spoken audio on there. I’m already gonna play this a few times, but if you filled the video with words on top of the music, I’d play it over (with premium, not ad blocker) and over for weeks.
Imagine that, only 100 million years ago things we’re so different 58:57
This is sooooooooooooo good!
anyone else notice something weird with the perspective of the tonian era?
i don't even want to guess how long it took to make this video GOODNESS
Kurzegast ,I've been watching your channel for years and I've grown and learned so much from you.  I know you probably won't see this but thank you for teaching me so much.  I am excited to see how this channel will grow in the  future! Thank for being by my side for so long kurzegast :)
The way earth never really stopped being a hostile environment is like a paradox at the same time 57:58
Incredible job 1 hour of animations is just unfathomable.
En pocas palabras me dejó sin palabras con este vídeo es absolutamente 🤯increíble el trabajo y el esfuerzo del equipo
You know what would be more interesting, it would be cool doing every second is a year of human history from the start of the human age to now.
Our time is relatively very less than even jurasic period
Is it me? Or does the music sometimes sounds like a Terraria music
jjk
When I realized the same type of things crawling in the sea are now crawling on the surface 🤯 56:35
Pretty cool you to got Deadmau5 to do the soundtrack.
The start of stenian got me💀
You guys deserve so much more than you get back from this content. I’m definitely going to buy something just to contribute to this going forward
(chill music) (hellscape that makes Doom look like paradise scrolling by in background)
this was awesome
took so long to make earth habitable but only took us 200 years to destroying it
Damn I wonder how it feels having sex as cells-
"don't blink or you might miss all of human history" that's really a very powerful statement and has a deep meaning ..thank you..!
Shouldn't the stars be moving perceptivly in the background?
Finally, a Kurzgesagt video that covers every topic on Earth!
W the LORD who recorded it with his HOLY camera
My entire perspective on the importance of the problems in my life just got radically shaken. I've never experienced a timeline that could so effectively & viscerally allow me to comprehend the passing of time. Job well done, time worth taking. My vote for a future experimental is the timeline of the universe so I can completely squash me ego lol Thank you so much, I'll be rewatching this for the rest of my life and sharing it with everyone.
You are bad people for doing this. Such a soulless cash grab.
Algae and colar reefs at least?? 53:38
This is amazing! Great job guys!
A version of this without the narration would be awesome. The narration is great, but studying to this is hard while also trying to listen to what's being said.
Do we know why it freezes then unfreezes? 52:40
I think the Ectasian was my favorite soundscape, but that's a hard call, I'm sticking with it.
Whoever did the music for the middle-end of rhyacian era was making heat frfr
If there is no O2 in the early stage of the earth, how can it filled with so much water? where are those water came from?
Oh my God! You guys really out did yourselves this time. This is stunning!
20:00 I thought DOOM music was about to start LOL Jesus…
45:00 truly the most important moment in Earth's history
Someone explain to me where the rain came from!? It went from lava to rain falling… from what source!!!!?
here comes the "prop to the camera man" comments
Terrific 💯
A-m-azing <3 <3 <3
I’m like still curiously looking all over for visible life 50:53
history of the entire world, i guess
Bro held his breath while talking about earth 💀
1 hour Kurzgesagt video? Am I in heaven?
Life finds a way! I like this so much!
Learning from this video--- You have potential( single cell) you just need right environment ( oxygen, water) to boom( multicellular organisms).. Creating perfect environment is a tedious process. But you can create it it in 4 billion yrs ... Thank u Kurzgesagt.. for this video. I want more of human history..🎉🎉
vibe of the music makes me think of rimworld
The anticipation from the music 48:35
So, today, kruzgesact wrote a another series story of "history of earth" heritages, on youtube. I love you guys!!!  I really like that videos like history of Solar system and earth by Algol, and this 1 hour video is insane indeed.
Love the music
The fact that the human part is only one second long is something really funny, and sad at the same time.
man kurz is still so underrated
47:24 these scenes are like precursors of what’s to come
1234 million years ago 44:24 123 million years ago 59:02
I was expecting 1hour of information dump but this is also fine
this is an art masterpiece, rather than just pure facts And my goodness, a wonderful 10 year anniversary video it is!  thanks for the 10 years of eye-opening videos, you guys have really changed my life.
holy mom, 1 hour of coolest motion graphic!
46:41 ooop are those hinting at fossils
1.186.942 wiews in first 9 hours. That is 2 life times watching 4.5 billion years in 1 hour. 🤯
18:08 "taste the sun" (in the bill wurtz voice)
I saw this video in my feed while at work, and immediately knew how I was going to enjoy it. I went home to set up my oculus, right next to my bean bag chairs. It waited patiently for me while I went back to work for a few hours. When I was done later in the evening, I came back home and 🍄, but wasn't ready just yet. I walked to my favorite local restaurant to eat some chips and guac, waiting for the magic. After walking back, I enjoyed this hour long journey of a lifetime—an EARTHtime really. I am so grateful for the enormity of time and effort and love that was put into this. I appreciated every single second... er, I mean, 1.5 million years.
Wow! it was very interesting. Thank you for the video. while watching the video I read Wikipedia :)
Teachers everywhere: thank you for this
Any screenshot on its own looks like a dedicated work of art, an entire 1 hour animation is insane, especially for free.
Wth I didn't believe it when I saw the duration. Thank you, Kurzgesagt.
44:07 the clouds that look like dinosaurs 🤩
1 hour of Kuezgesagt is an absolute Cinema!
I spent 4.5 billion years dancing just now
This 1 hr video is a really good idea. Give us more long videos content. I can never get enough of kurzgesagt. 😊
OU son of a b**** is putting that chill ass music over the millions of years of Rain part I see you I see you I'm not mad at it but I was thinking of something a bit more original
Every frame of this video could be a wallpaper
Utterly amazing! A true piece of art to just sit back and experience!   ... Now can you release a version that has a HUD around the sides of the video, with running stats on things like atmospheric composition, ambient temperature, and other useful metrics?
Eaerth is only 6000 years old LoL
Amazing to see this sort of work done by Kurzgesagt. Every frame has received quite an immense amount of tender love & care.
i love you guys
One of the few channels actually worth supporting
This was awesome, appreciate all the effort you guys put into these videos.
TO THOSE WHO ENJOYED THE MUSIC: The composer of the video is Epic Mountain, they are on spotify and apple music.  As a drummer, an Electronic music lover, and a lifetime science adorer, this video was fantastic. The drumming blew me away.
What a wonderful piece of artwork illustrating the history of earth. Congratulations.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love your video's We need a more video like this ❤
Bonus points if you redo the video in right to left scrolling for Arabic languages and top to bottom for Asian languages
Wait does that mean if you make 1.5 million dollars every second you have 4.5 billion dollars in an hour....or am I doing really lazy math
Best way to study evolution chapter by neet aspirant
All hail the algae Bangiomorpha
No Young Earth Creationists in here crying over this video?
01:00:08 "We are almost home" gave me goosebumps
nice
The one I've been waiting for.
Amazing AND beautiful!🥹
Part 2 when?
That was mesmerising
Bill wurtz would like to know your location
29:43 the rocks have a lil glitch
The st is killer
You made an entire Album. For one video. I love you so much. The music goes so hecking hard. Birb up!
That probably took 4.5 billion years to animate...
History of the Earth, I Suppose
human civilization is only in the last 7 milliseconds, out of the 1 hour video.
Thanks guys! Much love!
The best video you have put out in years. Yaaas!
The lack of a “the sun is a deadly laser” reference was really saddening, but this was an incredible video nonetheless
Kurzgesagt single handedly increasing my attention span
So good
29:39 the earth lags too 🙃
I love this channel! The hard work and dedication is insane!
This is so GOOD!!!!!!!
Permian 280 Million years ago : thanks volcano 🌋 : brrrrrr brrrrr
Phenomenal music even all the way to the outro
This music is fye🔥🔥🔥🔥
watching this drunkis trippy
Whoever made the soundtrack deserves a raise - it's really really good.   Side note: imagine how cool it'd be to make music for Kurzgesagt videos? Actually such a cool job (and whoever does it is really good at it)
Know think of what humans can create in just 1 million years or 1 billion years, we could be gods by comparison to us today.
Bill Wurtz did it in 19:26. Smh
Ninja turtle theme song
Holy crap I need this sound track
after watching I know realize that we humans have changed the earth so much in a couple thousand years. Crazy to think that at one point in time, nothing happened on Earth for a billion years.
Need popcorn for this video, usually just a normal meal, what a masterpiece 👏👏
I made it
Fav part gotta be the sex update
At 145.5 million years, this has the longest credits I have ever sat through.
Our human history got just 1-2 seconds 😂😂
Watching this video makes me feel like I play the game platypus.
The bgm tho
How long did it take you to make this, also i'm listening to this when I go to bed
🔥🔥🔥
Everyone praising the animation team but props to the musical team🔥🔥
Wow. Just wow.
Crazy to think that humans would have showed up in about a 5th of a second of the video
Wish it went into the future for the silicon based life we are evolving into 😅
Nice animation, good story analysis. Thank you Kurzgesagt for making useful videos. Looking forward to your next episodes 🌠🪐🌟
18:03 Taste the sun~
2019....whew..that's a long time. You can actually see how much they've improved over time. Keep up the good work!
Charles Darwin would be proud
You thought we would leave the video while we do other things instead of watching it all up close? Oh you silly
Picture this: Kurzgesagt the movie
gyatt 10 bajillion year
Wow !..
Thankfully after a nuclear war, life will find a way without us idiots.
Truly amazing! Now that you’ve covered all four of our world’s eons, I’d love to see another video like this that covers the latest eon in more detail!
The last 15 minutes was a visual feast.
Muito boooooooooom! S2
I love this community, everyones just really curious and ready to learn
And what does that "self-sustaining" nuclear reactor did to the Earth? How did it changed for example the climate or life?
Thank you Kurzgesagt, but next time try to compress the video a bit so I can understand it better :))
The music!!!!!
props to the animator for making 4.5 billion years of animation
Must have started animating 4.5 billion years ago
Bravo🎉🎉
I like the video. Is there a part 2 in the making?
Потрясающее видео! Смотрел с яндекс переводом. Kurzgesagt 👍
❤
incredible. a+++
An hour long Video this has to a dream!
Kurzgesagt 1 hour lofi chill beats to evolve to. (AMV) Fixed your title. Excellent video btw
I've watched 2 billion years so far and i have to say, this is really entertaining!
So, we men still live 4.5 billion years ago eh, since our floor is still lava ..
Mesoarchean music is too good oh myyyy
I have studied evolution in text but too see the animation could be fun.😅
This is truly inspiring.  I know there are "Streamys" which is Youtube's version of the Emmys, but I don't know if there's an award for best educational video.  This should be your entry.
Per each like will represent 150.000 years, so let's reach 600.000 likes in one hour
Them casually dropping this on a Friday pretending it’s not a magnum opus of animation, music, among other things.
26:18 YOU THINK I WOULDNT NOTICE THAT THEY (the dots on the screen) TELEPORTED?
The way you personify early life is always so interesting
How did only this video beeb able to turn on picture on picture mode?
crazy how each of those meteors were falling for milllions of years at the begining
Kurzgesagt!!! You’ve very literally absolutely outdone yourself this time! So many years of fantastic episodes already, and now this crowning jewel. Bravo 👏
Beautiful 👍🏾❤
THIS IS SO GOOD!!!
That means in the hadeon phase, it was all magma due to the absence of oxygen and not lava? Yes they're different
Alternate title: Earth Lore in 1 Hour
grasping the concept of time is hard, yet videos like this help to get a better idea of such big time periods  it's been years since I began following this channel. it has helped me a lot to keep my mind fresh as chronic illness has made it difficult to continue studies in areas of science. it also helped to not hate vectors 😂💕 honest, it helped aspire to make illustrations as gorgeous as this video  thank you so so much and congratulations to the team! may this celebration continue for more decades to come
props to the cameraman who has been capturing this for us for 4.5 billion years
Did anyone else get a glitch at 29:45?
I applaud you Kurzgesagt team. This video may serve as a perfect entry level knowledge into the history of our planet, teaching the most important parts and igniting the spark of curiosity, while also doubling down as a soundtrack video to relax or study.
you should re-post voice only  option i wanna play my music
thank-you for such a valuable content
One-hour animation with sound effects and music. WOW just WOW
Amazing video
nah, the world was created in 7 day by guy in white toga 7000 years ago
Now i have new study music.
Thank you.
The entirety of human civilization could have fit 100 times end to end in any single second of this video. This video went for an hour, we don't even constitute a dent in that.
The animation is pure perfection, and I do appreciate the Jean-Michel Jarre vibe of the soundtrack! Thank you so much for making this!
you could have said more...
With so many evolutionary branches lost in time who knows how many sapien like species came and went through the ages....maybe the great filter at play
the music banging tho 🗣🗣🗣
This is insane. This tought me more than my highschool ever did.
This deserves 4.5 billion views!!
I’m jamming with this music
The soundtrack turning into that dinosaur one when life started getting really exciting gave me so much joy. I love this channel so much.
What a marvelous piece of visual storytelling. This animated documentary deserves an actual Oscar. Truly.
Why is nobody talking about the soundtrack???  Nice 4/3 polyrhythm
Simply wow
Kurzgesagt, you guys totally outdid yourselves this time! This is a beautiful, beautiful piece!  My wife and I watched it all, from the start to the end. The animation is great, the music is fantastic and the information, too, is amazing. Productions like these are one of the reasons why we continue to share your channel with everyone we can and continue to buy your products.  I think that this video should be shown in schools and that humans have learned this much about our planet's history should be considered one of humanity's greatest achievements.  And to think, this is happening now, on other planets, and has been happening on other planets. Hey, if it takes roughly 4 billion years for "us" to arrive, maybe there's one other out there, somewhere!  Who knows: Maybe they even have their own Kurzgesagt with dinosaur-like creatures instead of ducks!
Kind of funny how you get so messemrised by the moon slowly creeping away that a billion years pass in the blink of an eye
Kurzgesagt's magnum opus has arrived.
You guys deserve so much more, Kurzgesagt! I grew up with your videos and I cannot imagine such a dedicated team of people who explain great things in the simplest way. Thank you ❤
Am I the only one vibing to the background music?
the music is great
44:59 i thought ned leeds invented sex!!
Huge respect for Kurzgesagt for giving us what is essentially an animated documentary for free. Can’t imagine how many hours went into this. You guys are insane 🐐🐐🐐
Wow what an annoying soundtrack, definitely wont be using this to get to sleep
Thank you for such a long video.
45:00 I will now refer to sex as “ancient algae activities”
wow
My mom always says it takes her 2 hours to make a meal just to be eaten in 5 minutes. But what’s next after? I hope some good nap.
DOOM like music kicks in around 19:50
came for the history of the planet, stayed for the banger score :D
I have no doubt that if this is our beginning then there is life sprawling all over the universe
45:00 so guys we did it, we invented sex
i played the hadean phase on 0.75 after rolling a massive joint
things really started heating up 800 million years ago, what a time to be alive
35:30 😁😌😁😌😌😁😌 🎶
I think it's really cool how for so long there was a whole lotta nothing and then almost like outta nowhere a whole lotta something happens. So poignant to see the evolution of everything
45:01 they literally did tell us the whole history 😂
This is the new LoFi girl thing for me now
God prepared earth for human for 4.5 billion years time frame. Surely no joke waiting for that so long.
I love everything this channel does. Thanks for giving us such great content I can't believe it's been 10 years. Congrats!
I was going go masturbate but here I am now strapped in for this journey, a win for the guys
brilliant work!!! that was awesome!!! loved it!!!
I think we should just change Hadean to Floor Is Lava Stage.
"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth."  - Genesis 1:1
Mom: only one last video  The video:
Good job with this
might take the day off to watch this repeatedly
Please tell me I wasn’t the only one who thought 20:00 music went so hard!
Fine, I'll try ARK: SE again.  Well done. Absolutely mesmerizing!
This soundtrack is fucking delicious.
My god never did I expect the one hour Kurzgesagt video! Christmas really did come early this year.
Could you upload a version without commentary, just music? It would be a fantastic background video for classrooms and such
All the hard work you guys do certainly doesn’t go unappreciated. What a great team of people. I love you all ♥️
I feel old now.
This is a real treat.... 1 whole hour of Kurzgesagt rendered beautiful animation and a sprinkle of voice over
Music turns into a new Tool album as you go, love it
would buy this album fr
Beverly Hills cop remix 36:45
Wow this video blew up quick, thanks for expanding my mind and keep up the good work guys!
The best video..has the worst background music. Whyyy😭😭
bravo!!!
Please someone make this whole thing into a wallpaper on Wallpaper engine
YES YES YES!!!! Kurzgesagt making videos on my favourite subject!!! less goooooooooooooooooo
As luck would have it, I had my weekly toke 15 minutes before stumbling upon this video, which was 10 minutes before my long shower. The stars all aligned. These background tunes are THE BEST! I'm gonna watch the rest in Waffle House now.
THIS IS SO COOL
I always thought that earth was created in 7 days
Don't have words for this video     Justttt"wooow"
good documentary video! 1:00:45
I love the history of Earth! Thank you!! And the animation is really good quality! 👏👏👏👏👏👍
Make this Video a Mandatory lesson In all the schools out there.
Why does this guy sound like the fitness gram pacer test guy
gotta give it up to bangiomorpha pubescens
So in the Tonian is was „Everything was better in the old times” invented. :D
This is the most fairy talish thing I’ve ever seen. No proof of such nonsense. God spoke it all into existence. No proof for evolution.
now we need e History of the universe until start of this video so then we have the whole story (first that video then this video and after this TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time)
This... This is true beauty. Thank you
47:27 Oooh, the period changing at 1000mya gives me SO much respect for geochronologists 😤
Ok, I’m going to cast this to my TV cause I know it’s gonna be worth it!
The amount of talent, time, and resources needed to produce this video is astounding. Y'all really went above and beyond, and it shows. This is utterly amazing!
This was oddly emotional
fire
i'm just here for the last 0.004 seconds
I wach the Entire thing and it started in 2019 that's insane BTW this is the longest video I ever watched completely with out stopping  edit: the longest video on youtube that I watched I gave gone to the moves to wach this long of a video never on a mobile device
Really? All this for free??
27:20 makes me want to go back and play flOw
This video was so frickin amazing, hope you guys can make more videos like this one!
Cap
Wow😢😮
The cameraman who recorded this timelapse 💀
44:56 Not me personally, but I think many will find this quite quotable...
Watching for the first time You have to watch the full video without skipping any part or doing any other thing to get the sheer insanity and fragility of our human existence. We humans cant even grasp the concept the 1.5 millions years here it just wisps in 1 second .  Kudos to the whole team ❤
this channel deserves all the love in the world 😢😢.... all the awards out there
The green bubbles look like broccoli swimming around at 26:19
this was AMAZING. congratulations on ten years. any where to listen to just the music from this? or artist pages. and a tutorial for this scrolling animation style would be so cool
"History of Earth. At first, things happened slowly, and then all at once. The end."
I can imagine this entire video stretching for hundreds of feet on a gallery wall as an epic installation piece, having to walk to the other side of a massive hall to see the whole thing would be incredible. This is a phenomenal work, congratulations to the whole team. I now need the beautiful scenes in this video to be a 10' long poster gradually transitioning though the eras.
This is just beautiful and somehow frightening
I blinked 🤦‍♂
Even though it's mostly repeating footage But it's still unbelievable it's 1 hour of animation
I LOOVEE this
WHAT A BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE THIS WAS!!! <3 <3 :') :')
please do similar video about the expected future of earth too!
This is fantastic. Would love a version condensed to the talking moments.
A truly wonderful experience! Puts a lot of history into perspective in a new way! Like how much later Earth's core actually developed than I thought.
I will watch all the ads on repeat. Thank you
This is the kind of video I would happily pay a subscription for. This channel has grown to such a degree that anyone interested in these matters will happily pay a monthly premium
This is some crazy disney pixar level animation
do one but for the entire universe
I love you forever and ever. Thank you so much for this. I will always support this channel
An hour? I can explain it in a sentence: BOOM=Universe, then Earth comes and things evolve.
A masterpiece!!!
The sobered up version of the Bill Wurtz joint.
Nice, only took me 47 years to get this far.
Wonderful! You did it, you made me feel and understand the ages of the earth in a way I never have before. Thankyou, Kurzgesagt.
44:55 Sex was discovered the first stage of pornographic Imagination the beginning of the downfall of humanity before it was even born LOL
Bro just dropped the ultimate background video
Wow. This is the most impressive kurzgesagt video as of date, and that says a WHOLE load
Congratulations. Great vid. Mthe music was great to
Alternate title: 4.5 Billion Picturesque Desktop Wallpapers in 1 Hour
this is incredibly incredible, words cannot express how amazing this is, and the fact that human civilization is just a very VERY tiny part in this is just WILD.
20:57 is that a big 🐫 camel
Humanity gotta remember this.
"We are one We are a universe Forebears of what will be Scions of the Devonian sea Aeons pass Writing the tale of us all A day-to-day new opening For the greatest show on Earth"
u really pulled out all the stops on this one
this video is amazing thank you for your hard work
Beautiful, how time flies.
19:16 "Also, there's no oxygen in the atmosphere yet." Welllllll, technically, there's lots of oxygen, it's just unfortunately combined with carbon....
1 hour kurzgesagt video? impossible
They named the algae that may have invented sex Bangiomorpha pubescens
The music is a bop
34:47 Language was reaally weird in 1978mya
Please release the soundtrack!
1:00:44 Even though there's a buffer bar up there in the corner, I don't think you should associate the word "Million" and an early human within the video because people might think we existed at that time. (should have depicted an early ape looking animation instead of a sapien)
Good soup
It won't take long before this video gets 4.5B views.
An entire hour of Kurzgesagt???!!!  This is Amazing!
Two seconds.
My complaints as I'm watching are as follows: Says that photosynthesis might have started as early as the start of the mesoarchean, immediately says there are no photosynthesizers iirc mass oxygenation became a problem because there was too much oxygen for life, causing a mass extinction. This isn't brought up in the slightest. Pays no mind to the Krebs cycle Brings up massive impactor with zero payoff Algaebanjowarfopubescence is brought up and given zero explanation. I have no clue what this is and only have questions.  Cryogenian immediately asks how life could have survived earth freezing over again. Says that we don't know. My immediate thought is that, much like lakes, it just froze the surface and a few meters deep. This would never have killed off all life at this time. Mentions variety if life in Cambrian, shows 2 creatures. Says the atmosphere was only oxygenated in the silurian. This is false. "Fish and first vertebrate" fish are vertebrates. Blames volcanoes for Permian extinction. iirc we do not actually know why the Permian extinction occurred.   The video was mostly great, yall did great, even if I was a bit nitpicky. If you can make the little improvements to your writing that would fix these small issues that would be awesome, keep up the good work either way!
Fantastic! Thank you for that!
This is absolutely beautiful, definitely my favorite episode!!!
Best channel on YouTube.
I would've unfollowed this channel if the soundtrack wasn't good deep progressive house A++ work
Truly amazing!!
Cool video
The soundtrack reminds me of terraria
The video feels like the classic game Space Impact of 3310, where every era is a new game level.. The music is sick too!
Great vid
No shit, a one hour long video by kurzgesagt
The background music kinda sounds like a dream theater song
This is so daunting yet beautiful history of earth. It's such a magnificent event to happen that the earth needs to be hit with a meteor twice for us to exist.
Tonight I’m useing this to fall asleep this music is amazing and don’t get me on the animations 🤯 and the fact you use simple shapes wow just wow you did great you might not see it in the sea of comments but if you do you did great no… AMAZING
no better way to start my morning
This video is AMAZING !!!
Wow I wasn’t expecting a slight push to cry towards the end there when it hit me for the first time how amazing this all isn
You could have added a lot more explanations and information for the viewers during the times of the film when it was just scenes and speechless music.
You guys are very cool, been watching for years!
I love how in a blink the asteroid changed the landscape forever
this taught me more in an hour than a week at school
respect to 1 hour of animation content, great job
Aweee man i blinked at the end :(( would have loved to know how human timeline ended
congratz! an amazing video
what an amazing video    sending love to the team❤
Music in the mesoarchen era went hard
this is a vibe
When you feel important just remember, our entire species doesn't even make a blip on the timeline!

WTF an hour? Craziest thing I've seen on YouTube
One of the best, if not THE best video I've ever seen
That…  That was superb. Thank you.
"Life, uh, finds a way." Nonchalantly slipped into the Jurassic, clever, girl.
30:10 Seriously cool camera effect, like icing on the cake (puns now intended) 31:00 Frozen (in the animation sense) dot of snow in the centre? Seemingly a subtle art style shift too, with a 'rougher' brush texture and static ponds
@kurzgesagt could make some good lofi tracks man
You guys deserve an Oscar, nobody is doing it like you.
54:09 does that happen to be the marvelous breadfish?
20 minutes in and forgot what I was watching and thought it was a deep house dj set lol great music
Can you do a version of this but narrowed down to something like just human history? It'd be really cool.
way cool. sick music! dope edit. man best video you guys made. Which is a huge statement considering all your videos are DOPE!
I haven't done animation in After Effects since high school. But I knew immediately that this was a TON of work for your channel to put out.  The multiple layers, effects, keying, sound design, literally EVERYTHING in this video takes days, weeks, or months to do. The fact that you guys were able to create this and publish onto YouTube of all places is astounding to me. The quality is insane. Whatever your animators get paid, it isn't enough.   Bravo 👏
This should be left playing in loop in all public TVs/screens for atleast a month every year so that kids and even adults can watch this spectacle history of our planet.
New risk of rain soundtrack dropped?!
Lies, it’s only been one hour!!!
Wait how is there no oxygen in the air before and at Mesoarchean but theres water ?  Amazing animation by the way
I can't wait for the soundtrack release...
10:39 Interesting, at this point the 'texture' of the water stops moving in sync with the camera and instead locks to the surface.
claim your "I love kurzgesagt forever" here!
Brilliant thanks for this! I love your animations!
You didn't reproduce the night sky to reflect the moving of stars? Disappointed.
we literally witnessing history
I listen to youTube doing other things but I had to keep stopping to see the beautiful animation. Amazing animation and mysic.
i just finished my dinner and it only took me a billion years.....
So educational channels CAN succeed on youtube...
FUN FACT: YOU CAN WATCH ONLY THIS VIDEO IN PICTURE IN PICTURE WITHOUT YT PREMIUM
I have Autism and this music has Maybe feel quite relaxed thank you Kurzgesagt
Nice cartoon
Must have been hard for this DJ to play the music for 4.5 billion years
Animator was always there
Huge W
Hats off to the Kurzgesagt team for giving us this gem! 🤌🏾
Excellent DJ set 🎉
Inspiring
this is soooo cooool!! this has to be one of  the coolest videos you guys have released! much love <3
Yet the question remains, who was playing that music all that time?
This is a masterpiece
wasnt there a dark stage after the dinosaur asteroid?? how did mammals survived it or how did they surged?
i watch your videos every night before i go to bed and have for months, i watch them because i love  science and  i learn so much from them, they help me relax and get to sleep, Steve's voice and the beautiful animation style and music is just the most wonderful experience. Although i love science, i wasnt someone who could learn it the way we were taught at school and now being 20 and watching these videos, ive learnt more than i ever couldve in highschool, all while im settling down for the night. when i saw this video get uploaded last night, it was like my one dream came true, a long, relaxing, informational kurzgesagt video on the history of our planet!  Thank you to everyone on board at kurzgesagt, you've reignited my love of science and learning with all the amazing content youve produced, we all really appreciate your hard work and we thank you! I've bought your new calendar for next year and i am so excited to put it up on my wall right next to my mirror!  much love, gracie from australia!
Educational Anime set to 90’s video game music.  Perfection 🤌🏼
Please make birthday cards!
This is the closest to time machine that most people will ever get to for a very long period of time.
I love the concept for this video. Watched every century of it
I can't remember what the soundtrack is called at 58:40 can someone let me know? I've heard it before and loved it.
The soundtrack!! I'm picking up a lot of Meshuggah influences in the heavier parts of the soundtrack like during the Mesoarchean and the Ectasian and Stenian.
Whoa dude
This should be a wallpaper available on wallpaper engine
I would be cool if you'd shown a small termometer/barometer all along the way. Just to get it an idea what it's like on the surface.
Love it! Kurzgesagt is my fav youtube channel!
29:43 some glitch
i was expecting the british to make a cameo, so sad
❤❤❤
This might just be the coolest thing I've ever seen on YouTube. I can't imagine how much work it must've taken, hats off to the Kurzgesagt team all around.
Insane
1 billion views for this video  🙌
Well, we've GOT to see a making-of video. Perhaps Patreon exclusive?
I don't like it when people say stuff like "impossible for your brain to truly grasp", especially with regards to scale.  Scale is not that hard. 4.5 billion is a relatively big number. 4.5 billion years is a relatively long time. But it's not beyond comprehension by any means, and I dislike the assertion otherwise. Please don't talk down to your audience like that.
10:07 so the climate naturally changes? 😂 ok Greta
❤❤❤
0:23 ALREADY!????
Marvelous film. The depiction of human history at the end is heartwarming, even if appropriately brief. Well done.
Idc im watching this
love this vid alr
You ve always tried to put history in perspective. But till this moment I have found hard to imagine it. Thank you kurzgesagt now I feel how new and young we are 🎉
This is beautiful. Makes me feel Statherian.
1 hour lf animating is amazing, but dont neglect the music either. The music and sound design is some of the best I've ever heard, especially for a 1 hour video.
Repley to this comment if you watched the entire thing.
This really did put it into perspective how new not just humanity is but multicellular life in general  Other videos that try to explain the history of Earth spend so little time on the first three and a half billion years that the last billion feels like it takes up most of Earth's history  And we haven't even been around for a second
How did Kurzgesagt forget that the Great Oxidation event caused the first mass extinction in Earth’s history?
A one hour Kurzgesagt video is a bigger treat than all the candy I've gathered in 24 years of experiencing Halloween. Always look forward to these uploads!
Thank you so much
Wow! I slept off and woke up several times and yet life was still invisible. I'm glad I did not miss the interesting part.
I love how the joke the internet has created with a fish trying to grow legs for millions of years as opposed to natural selection
45:00 - The biggest hero of Earth's history  55:49 - The biggest villain of Earth's history
This is amazing, thank you!
is it Dream Theatre on the BGM? 🤣
I’m so grateful for being able to watch this for free. We should be paying for this honestly 😭
This will be an iconic youtube video.
39:53 did he just spit into the mic? o.o

Glitch frames at 00:29:44
This is one of the best videos on YouTube, it's so beautiful I couldn't stop watching. I can't believe I waited so long to watch this. Kurzgesagt is extremely underrated.
Minutes 3-6 I forgot i was watching a Kurzgesagt video and started just grooving to the music in my kitchen.
I watched this forever the hole video. Loved it and love your Chanel and am interested to see more of you guys doing super projects like this one.
such a cool video
Gracias por tanto Kurzgsagt, perdón por tan poco
FREE MOVIE WHATT
I am going to fall asleep to this video in the future.. alot.
Thank you very much nutshell, have a great day today be happy and healthy lifes
Let's see how many days it takes me to watch this (I'm sleeping to this)
в любой момент можно поставить на паузу и картинка останется четкой 👍🏼👍🏼
That took a while to watch all of and the humans were there for so long
I have so much deja vu from this video I can't explain it
Can someone explain why earth freezed during cryogenian period.
naaaa you lost me when you didn't say where the rainwater came from
This is mindbending to see the fact on how you animated this so fast!
what...?
Hello Kurzgesagt!
Can you make koreac cc plz?
I don’t understand why the rain happened…it went from lava to rain…why?
Imagine wathing this in an imax theatre!
Absolutely amazing
Someone needa freestyle over this hour long banger
See, it all makes perfect sense until you learn they found cave drawings of dinosaurs and soft tissue in dinosaur bones. With that knowledge the billion-year-old earth theory begins to get a little more difficult to endorse believe.
Big props to the cameraman for having the stamina to film for all 4.5 billion years
Amazing. Thank you for all your hard work. I definitely felt... present.
God I love this channel
That was stunning.  Thank you.
I love the music it has hints of solar fields, Jean Michel Jarre, pink Floyd, Sync24. I like it
🎶 The way the beat of the music was in sync during the Stenian period was such a lovely detail. Just one many reasons why this video is such a masterpiece.  History of humans next?
27:04 reminds me of Terraria
10 Years! It's been a wild ride! Congrats Kurzgesagt! And may you keep educating us for evermore!
Nice synthwave music.
POV: waiting for mom to finish talking to her friend at the grocery store.
Great work kurzgesagt I sat through and watched the whole thing, your videos are so good (I like the animation by the way)
Amazing video!
Having already watched Netflix's "Life on our Planet", this gives the me summary of the earth's entire existence for 4.5B years. Amazing work as always Kurzgesagt!!!
the person that  change the playback speed to 0.5 for no reason:
This is crazy
Time passed by quickly
God created the earth!!!!!
I'd like to nominate this as the best video on YouTube. Is there like a guy you gotta talk to for that?
Please. Yes. And Yes. Please
This was an amazing journey!
Evaluate the extent to which slavery debates between 1830-1860 contributed to the Civil war.
The video and animation are AMAZING, but the best part for me is that this soundtrack SLAPS.
Such a visual masterpiece. This video is so nice to look at
Nearly all of human existence took place in the last frame. What will the next frame look like?
This video is the best video on the internet this video will be a treasure for future generations to come this video is bigger than capitalism it’s bigger than our current ways of thinking Kurzgesagt is doing gods work ngl
Much hot and comfy. Yes.  Notwithstanding the incredible amount of human people power it required to construct this masterpiece... I want more. More please.
Wonderful
Futurama tried to educate us
Amazing! Wouldnt it be cool if yall did a similar video but about like insects to smthn, or maybe like the growth of an ant colony, I would PAY to watch an ant colonies life in an hour with you and your teams amazing animation.
Amazing video
59:40 Life is thriving, nothing can go wrong... Wait... what is tha-
I believe Cardven Token will change E-commerce forever. Thank me later!
Muslims and Christians dislikes this video, regards it as heresy. 😅
Cardven Token is launching, 1000x gains. Thank me later...
Cardven token will moonshoot after CEX listing..
Cardven token is awaiting major CEX listings. Its possible to hit 100x this year.
I believe Cardven token will go 100x after launch on Binance
_I bet you are watching this with one leg over the other !_ ✨
Any thoughts about Cardven Token? I myself think its the best thing since sliced bread.
Any thoughts about Cardven Token? I myself think its the best thing since sliced bread.
Walmart and Cardven token just signed a collaboration??
You dont want to miss to invest in Cardven. Best crypto this year Brutal gains expected
Cardven token will make millionaires, after CEX listing it will blow up.
Bill wurtz did it better
I can't express my gratitude to Kurzgesegt team 😊🎉🎉
This is great! A journey of 4,5 billion years adventure of the Earth's stages, awesome ❤🔥
45:02 Sex was invented
cameraman never dies
Kurzgesagt, when will be aviable in your shop this awesome soundtrack?
This is a beautiful video! Only took 4.5 billion years to post lol. Now i can crochet while traveling in time with this video
Earth is developing for 4,5 Billion of years even until today, are we human going to destroy it in a single Era? Imagine how cruel for us Human to do that. We must protect Earth!
It's amazing to see that most of the history we know happened just in the last 10 minutes
You had me at The floor is Lava. Well played sir.
WE FINIALLY FOUND OUT WHO THE KURZGESAGT VOICE IS life goals = accomplished
Blud made a whole movie.
I was gonna say thanks for the amazing video, but with 9k comments they’ll never see it, so I’m just gonna say this video sucks 😡😂
this is one of the most best videos right now! i really like how you made it so realistic and a real historic event and while maintaining the art In 10 hours!
This video makes me once again yearn for Spore 2.
Nice soundtrack
Wow started watching this with 900k views ended watching with 1.05mil views
Bill Wurtz:  "No, *this* is world history"   No but really this video is amazing an probably took years to make
This is still 9 times faster than my Diablo 1 Demo download on dialup 😁
This feels like a direct evolution of the Dinosaur Extinction - Minute by Minute episode… which was the calendar of 12,022. If that one didn’t exist, I’d think this one would be the calendar of this year, instead of the one we got.
This deserves every seconds of my life to watch. I'm preparing my wings and popcorns.
Cubic pillows, soap, and curealls appear to have existed for a brief 3 million years in the Eoarchean 🤔
This is beautiful. Thank you Kurzgesagt for making this for us :)
Really liked the video! I'm sure ai was used for some visual assets though.. probably in Illustrator using prompts?
What is the name for this theme 59:00?
This had better be getting a Webby Award.  Best hour I've spent on the WWW in a while.
sheeeeeeeeeeesh
awesome!
how they have cool music back then? 0.O
44:58 CEO of Sex
It was… beautiful

Crazy how long it takes for life to be created.
I remember watching VSauce's "Our Narrow Slice" video several years ago, where they dedicated the last ~2 minutes to moving forward 1 millenia per second since the beginning of humans (200,000 years ago), and I found it to be one of the coolest efforts to conceptualize our... narrow slice in time. Everything except the last couple seconds was a whole lot of nothing. Primitive agriculture, ancient Romans, and ancient Egyptians all evolved very quickly for a few seconds at the end, and then modern civilization as we know it seemed to be a single frame. And that was just spanning the lifetime of MODERN humans, a mere 200,000 years ago. This video takes that concept to a whole new level. Our infinitesimally small droplet of a droplet in the ocean of an unfathomable elapsed amount of time (and even more time to come) is something we'll never be able to truly grasp, but I love attempts like this to do so. It makes me feel so special and insignificant at the same time, and I think that's a beautifully complicated feeling everyone should try to attach to the very core of their being. Our privilege to live in such an incomprehensibly wondrous universe on such a beautiful planet at such an interesting time is too often taken for granted.
I think it would be a really cool marketing campaign to release a no music version: 1. This could be a really cool background at a board game night.  2.  Being able to play your own music over it would be cool the cause the sound effects would add cool atmosphere.  3. Being able to create music over this would be cool.
Sound design in this video is just chefs kiss.
Absolutely incredible. Can't wait to share this with my daughter as she gets older ❤
Someone at kurzgezagt is a Tool fan. I guaran-fucking-tee it. That mesoarcheon era was straight Chancellor/Jones style goodness.
thank u for proving there is GOD behind this design, your video shows a logical steps of creating a life
1 hour animation and few years = RESPECT
даже лава приняла форму воды и ты сможешь (сор за туп)
"User: algea Bangiomorpha unlocked acheivement: Sex"
I just want to comment to help feed the algo
BEST YOUTUBE CHANNEL, PERIOD!
just think about the possibility that you are able to see and comprehend this, just fucking crazy and almost unbelievable. however we are just a drop of a drop and so on in the infinite sea called space
props to anyone and everyone who worked on this, no matter what role they played. Glorious.
well, if you're reading this, you have read the longest to make comment. why? because while watching this video, i have spent billions of years just to correct and write a few words. I am just here to say, that in a letter, there are words, and what makes words? Thats right, letters. but sadly I didn't make that in ms word. Thats all im gonna say, have a good day.
here to the ppl that watched the whole thing thru and did not regret it. 👇
can you show the giant mushroom trees
When I first saw this I thought, "Oh wow, a 1hr video from them! I can't wait to watch this!" And then when I actually watch it.. It was pretty boring. It's like I'm watching paint dry on the wall.  I know, the point of the video is to watch how our earth evolves but damn, I mostly skip parts where there's not much happening.  Good music btw.
Such an expressive video I hope that you can make more and more each year and thank you kurzgesagt For your amazing videos and see you next time🎉❤
when i go back in time, i'll make sure to keep this time scale in my formula: 1M yrs = 1 sec  ..... or else everything will be boring. Not forgetting this sound track as well...
First langgesagt video i've watched
It's always still crazy to think about how no one knows how everything was first created. I mean the furthest back scientists have figured out is the big bang, but what was before that? Makes me existential.
I know its a lot to ask for but i would really appreciate a video like this about the history of humanity
4.5 billion hours in 1 year
whoever made the soundtrack for this video needs a pay rise, that stuff was AMAZING
I felt LOTS of something while watching, I absolutely adored this whole thing. I'm so glad the Kurzgesagt team took such care and time into this, I geeked out about pretty much every frame for the entire hour-ish.
Can we get the soundtrack, please.
Thanks a lot for this video 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽🫱🏼‍🫲🏽
There's a small glitch at the bottom of the video at 29:43
The 2 best youtubers for space or time are probably kurzgesagt and melodysheep
The door is lava be like
Let's see how these new species of ape do...
The video I did not know I wanted.
OMG
Has it really been 4.5 billion years... damn I lost track of time. It felt like just an hour to me.  Whose going to the sun 21st birthday? They grow up so fast
This channel gave me a love of learning that I probably wouldn't have had if it wasn't for their videos Id go as far as to say this is one of the best channels on YouTube
I started smiling when I realised its a 1 hr video
This video is amazing. I need it  on the spanish channel!
1.5 milllion years pass in 1 second so every time you blink 375 thousand years go by so yeah dont miss it
I am using this video as my desktop background now, I love it!
Absolutely breathtaking soundtrack.
This video really inmerses you into how long it ACTUALLY took all of us to get here, and its amazing!
Waited millions of years for that beat to drop
THAT WAS AMAZING. Watched 3 times in a row, teared up at the end all 3.  I resubscribed. A few months ago, seeing all the death and doom was getting to me and I needed a break. But I kept subscribed to Epic Mountain, and I was looking at my subscription feed, and I was like, "wait 6 tracks at once? What just happened?"
Thank you! So beautiful
Yes, in just 12,000 years of Civilization humanity creates machines capable of autonomously annhilating all the Organic life evolved over this 4.5 Billions of Years 🦾🤖🔥☢️💀🏭 Congratulations to you all Humans, so Civilized we are!😊
And 3 minutes
1 hour of kurzgesagt?… I might just be in heaven
Please just don't blurb anything about the man made climate crisis at the end.
48 seconds ago
Bill wurtz is proud
This is pretty good
It calms me doing my work project deadline
What a Jewel! Thanks for this amazing one, it really fits as a 10 years special
I am amazed :o
i usually dont like or comment on youtube videos.. but this one forced me to do both
When are we getting the entire art scroll for this video as merch, I need this on my walls
this is something else.. way beyond of any videos have been created so far.. what a legend! good job Kurzgesagt !
Words can't describe how amazing this is huge round of applause for the kurg team of animations and editors thank you for giving us this movie for free
And some people thing a man did this all in 7 days .
This video is beautiful and  a masterpiece!!
Damn Miss Earth was boring for a long ass time!
Hell yes to more experimental content! ❤
Beautiful!  I loved watching this.  Thank you!
I want this video as wallpaper engine's wallpaper
the first half of "history of the entire world, i guess" be like
Finally  i can hear the relaxing sound for 1 hr 😊
Great video thankyou!
Time flies so fast, i can still remember my man jimmy in the Paleoarchean age
It's fascinating to see how many extinction level events have happened wiping out all of life on the planet, but yet a few million years later and it's back stronger and more complex. I interpret it almost as if life is the the universes laws of matter moving towards equilibrium. Kind of like gradient descent but at the scale of the universe. It makes me wonder about all the trillions of other planets out there. If a few multi-cellular organisms can pop up here with some basic inorganic compounds and survive dozens of extinction level events, it's hard to believe that we are alone in this wonderous and vast cosmos.
i just realised this is a new video
10 million years led to this moment.
this might be the best hour ever.
Oh my gosh, it's the Time theme!  59:25
hats off to camera man for surviving and shooting throughout 4.5 years of vigorous environments.
According to the Sumerians the object that slammed into the Earth was called Marduk.
AT 17:56 there is a huge mistake. The oceans at the time were RED because the first ever algal organisms had an iron composition before consuming co2 from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen from photosynthesis. The ocean would gradually become green but at the time it red. When photosynthesis occurred over time the red algae would drop their iron structure and create the first ever iron red beds in the archean lithology.  - Geology student in Mount Royal University
this is awesome
when i started to watch this video it was 9hours old and now its 11 hours old!
Did you use AI?
History of the entire world, I guess
Fascinating just how little of Earth's history life as we know it takes up
Thank you Bangiomorpha pubescens, doing a service to us all o7
yes
In a blink of an eye I missed 1.5 million years.
if you skip ahead in a video, isnt that considered time travel?
In a blink of an eye I missed 1.5 million years.
What a great film! Well Done! And THANK YOU for NOT using Ravel's "Bolero" for the soundtrack.
I truly respect all of your work and hard work, it must have been a gigantic amount of effort for this. But I have to say that the format itself turned out pretty bad. Too long and quite boring, I felt like jumping to every beginning of each chapter. It could be faster and it would feel much better.
1 hour Kurzgesagt video? I'm so hard rn
Now we just need something helping us comprehend how long 1.5 million years is
this is just the entire history of the world i guess.
Loved it, that was awesome thanks everyone! Part 2 might be The last two million years of early human evolution to Present
what a brilliantly amazing video idea. I'm actually shocked by how clever that is. well done.
history of the entire world I guess, in a nutshell
masterpiece.
can someone tell me where i could find the captions(i mean like the script) for this? I want it for a writing project.
Strangely, it felt like the fastest hour ever.
33:49 And we don't get to see this asteroid impact? Even if it messes with the scale of the video, I'd still appreciate the visual of the event...
Time flies, I guess!
I think this is one of the best ways to explain how little our history makes of earths, as the majority of this video would have been 1 or 2 lessons on school, while modern humanity would be a full sized topic.
why did all the asteroids come in in one direction?
Mr Wurtz did it first, and more concisely. You guys have much to learn  Jokes aside, amazing video.
I feel like the premise was let down by lack of narration. I just watched an hour long slide show, whereas you could have been talking and explaining and showing. Instead, just occasional useless facts and jokes.
Ugh these youtube ads are millions of years long!
This was incredible and beautiful, thank you all for doing this
This and a blunt, unironically. Awesome work. I hope this goes down in the history of Youtube as one of the most utterly brilliant and unforgettably iconic moments ever.
“Hey there’s a dinosaur,” legitimately caught me off guard. Made me crack up. 😂
29:41 why does it glitch
Props to the camera man for giving us this master piece
Congratulations. Happy 10th anniversary. What a beautiful video.
Can't imagine how many times After Effects crashed during production of this
4.5 Billion years ago was even before Cliff Richard was born!  😀
The time period: 🥵  The music: 🥶
what, 1 hr??? really shocked
can u make this a vr experience
Props to the camera man for sticking along for 4.5 billion years
I want this as a screen saver for my tv it is nice
Every 10 seconds you skip, you are just skipping a dozen million years
can someone confirm i think the music on 26:15 is from the movie bubble i think its a remix but it is exactly the same.
Goddamnit I love this channel
oh boy, a whole hour straight of kurzgesagt? *grabs popcorn*
Good shit guys.
The moon burning at the beginning with that electronic music is the most burning man thing ever
Oh wow   I comment to help statistics
I like this. Do you?
This would be a sick video game <3
Tips: Look for the transcripts in the description
bill wurtz moment
This was Amazing! I "knew" a lot of these facts about the time-frame, but didn't really comprehend them until I sat through it, to scale.
an entire hour of kurzgesagt? this must be my lucky day!
That was the longest hour of my life
El video es simplemente perfecto, los colores, los detalles, la música, sobretodo la música del video es perfecta, cada cuadro es como una pintura, se ve todas las miles de horas de trabajo que debio tardar realizar esto, esto no es solo una pelicula, es una experiencia absoluta  Los amo mucho Kurzgesagt <3
29:42 Some kinda glitch happened to earth here.
REMINDER: turn off your adblock for this channel.
The soundtrack goes crazy
This is sped up 31.5 trillion times
Loved this, got the duck plushie, awesome video!
was i not the only person that noticed a familiar leitmotif around 14:00
The matrix glitched for the first time, just before 2350 million years.
wow
If you watch closely at 59:48, thats when "god" apparently made the earth
A damn shame that adverts really messed up the flow of the video
1 hour video? We eating good!👍
Well done.
Not better than bill wurtz's "the whole history of the world, i guess"
Earth is just water and rock for most of it. This video does a good job of explaining what the "great filter" is - definitely that jump from unicellular to multicellular life in the cambrian explosion.
I have a feeling that I know how this is gonna end and if so I’m gonna be audibly laughing
At 55:45 "It is the Devonian my dudes!"
That was quite a good groove.
Fantastic. Now do one with all of human history that shows that civilization is almost as small compared to it, as humanity is to the entire history of Earth.
Shoutout to Epic Mountain for the incredible music!
And that kids, is how I met your mother
you made 4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour, I watched that 1 hour in less than 3 mins.  Just moving through the preview with mouse.
I´m speechless. Just one word to describe what I felt watching this video: Awe. Congratulations, Kurgesagt; keep on feeding our imaginations, our brains, and our hearts. Thank you.
8:38 why is it only "probably"? Do we have a concrete evidence for that? where did all the water come from?
55:53 i see Tiktaalik
This is more than a movie
uh oh i think im gonna watch this one a few times lol
Those Algae’s that invented sex might have been twisted beyond understanding 🫤🫤🫤
"such a bummer"
Amo tanto este video, cada imagen, cada detalle, cada efecto, cada movimiento es simplemente hermoso, es una absoluta maravilla
Awesome video by kurz
what the fuck. What the /fuck/.
When did i buy YouTube Premium?
Almost 1 million views in 10 hours!
Best vid to restore your attention span
This was absolutely wonderful!
I loved every bit of that video. I whis they roughly explained humanity in a symbolic minute or less but this is a masterpiece as is
incredible that the earth had certified bangers as early as the hadean.  (seriously this soundtrack is great)
For all those who helped create and fund, you guys are out of this world!
This isn't just a video, it's a whole experience
Billions of years of time and still not as long as waiting at the dmv
Amazing video! Whoever did your music is awesome, some cool djent vibes in there
This makes me think that we are just a fraction of time in this planet. A smaller fraction comparing this to the universe. We are just almost nothing.
Love the video! At 29:44 there is a slight glitch.
This track is a fckin BANGER!  Reminds me of The Orchard Lounge.
I've won YouTube- I found the best video! The music is superb.
Fun fact: The only Kurzgesagt video (in history?) without the signature intro.
Finally I finished watching the video ;-; 1 hour long...
*Nice!*
Nicely done in the Jurassic. "Life.. uh... finds a way."
Thank you for making something like this. I loved all of it.
Kurzgesagt Movie!
Twenty-seven unique backgrounds, one hour, and six soundtracks! Wonderful
Came for the title.  Stayed for the music
I would pay for this as a an animated desktop wallpaper. Imagine having earth's history flowing hourly right on your workspace.
I was hoping to see the massive mushroom fortest hehe
this is what i need for a video thank you really thank you
Ectasian hit different
Kurzgesagt the movie?!
I am starting to watch this with a hope of finding a Bill Wurtz reference
First I wanted to watch it in x2 speed but THE MUSIC MAN!
can we please get a full soundtrack without commentary, the music was great in on its own
If I could give 4.5 billion likes I would. Intriguing visual/audio work on display. Thanks to all at Kurzgesagt for this video.
What is really cool is that even hundreds of millions of years ago there was techno-pop music. It seemed to be going on in the background the entire lifespan of the earth! Just wish they could have turned it down a little.
… 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 The part be said “the [very long word] cells.. might have invented sex.” That got me choking on air
If you guys can pull off an hour long video (which you clearly can) then you should DEFINITELY turn your IMMUNE book into a complete video series. I would show that to everyone I know and watch it repeatedly until I actually remembered most of it.
Awesome video. And with music to match. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey through the 4.5 billion years of planet building. Thank you!
That one religious guy here; "Incorrect because god said 'LET THERE BE LIGHT' "
Very nice idea and cool video, thx!
I loved this video. When I wasn’t absorbed in the visuals, the music was relaxing.
45:04 is when sex is invented for anyone who came here for that
great video! the statherian and calymmian were my favorites 1:01:48 absolute banger of a channel theme btw
"Life, huh, finds a way."  Nice reference!
Loved every bit of the video, just incredible.
Christians: *explains their religion and says the universe is young*  Athiests: "Religion and science dont mix. Stop shoving your religion down our throats."  Athiests: "explains their religion and says the universe is old*  Also athiests: "Ah yes. Now this is fine."  Who said your religion was the default? If God isn't taught in schools, why should evolution be? Both are defined under the definition of religion.
This prog rock song has a pretty dope music video. Intetesting choice of lyrics, but i cant hate on people trying something new.
Holy crap the amount of speculation in this video is insane
truly none of the success you will get will ever match what you deserve. Guys keep it going your work is aknowledged and appreciated
I swear this is my favorite channel ! There’s no other educational channel like it !
How AMAZING would a Kurzgesat video game be??
Thank you kurzgesagt !! Best channel on yt 🌟
"And the floor... is lava". Literally
Didnt know I need watch this, until I watched it.  Thank you Kurzgesagt, it's a really nice job
This animation is soooo good, and this video is of an hour, it must have taken days and months to make this video, i wish i could support, but I'm limited to liking and subscribing.
Can we give huge praise to the composers that wrote a 1-hour piece just for this video
Mad props to the editor for breaking time and space to create this monument.
AMAZING!
This video is amazing. I'm sharing it more than I share others from this channel. I love the narration but I would also love to have a version of this without narration so I can play this in the background with just the music. I'd probably leave it on repeat on my big screen just for the ambience -- both the music and the visuals. Please make a version without narration!
The only channel that can get away with showing a video in class ;) A new channel would not get so many views for such chillness. Great work, keep them coming :) Love the art style of your content.
I know this probably took ages and a lot of effort but I would love to see a full 360" VR version of this one day
Oh I felt something alright 🤩
Billions years of terraforming, millions years of evolution, so some bipedal mammal can make everything about skin colors.
🤩
This was a big nutshell!  Also thanks Bangiomorpha pubescens.
Now this is what I want from kurzgesagt, just a long video for entertainment
Took me 1 billion years to write dis comment…………… 😮😮😮😮😮HELP IM DYIN
how did you know all this?
"I'll just turn this on while I start dinner." 800 million years later... "Ooops, I forgot to start dinner."
yes good i enjoy
Is there a version without narration?   This video is a vibe.  Thank you for your efforts!
ya ok but what are ur sources?
58:40 That has to be one of the most beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard!
I love this so much, took me a billion years just to write my comment while having a quack plushie
After 3 hours... I AM HERE
wow
This is one of the best videos I’ve ever watched!!! Thank you!!
Wow 24:14
Play in the background while I work? No thank you I’ll be staring at this beautiful animation for the next hour thanks 😂
yo, this is 1 HOUR???! Love you, Kurzgesagt.
f#$%ing amazing! i LOVE you guys. sincerely...thankyou
Ai 6 tão de sacanagem ne possível lindo demias isso é conteúdo 🎉
45:00 SEX REAL?! POG
found this gem of a video only after 45 billion years of it publishing! guess I'm early!
“back in my day…”
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was amazing.  Now do "4.5 MILLION years in 1 hour" at one-thousandth the scale.  Every 1.5 seconds would be a thousand years.  All of human history would still only be a few seconds long.
29:44 hmm graphics no longer that insane
Shout to the cameraman this shit’s dope 💯
this is actually kurzgesagt's instrumental prog rock debut album
This guy needs to get 1B subs man the work is insane the animations are INSANE everything is insane.
Do you remember any of it? That's how long eternity is going to feel after we're gone.
Thank you very much!
A BIG thumbs up to the imaginative visual and audio artists. Cool music I could definitely use in the background while studying and fabulous passing scenes. Well done on a long animation and congrats to the narrator too. Like it a lot.😊
finally, 1 hour of kurzgesagt content
the moon is an artificial satellite that shouldn't exist.
0:51-13:20 Lofi Science Radio 🧪- Beats to Relax/Study to
Pretty sick, also, also non globalist sponsored!
Watching this after the Loki season 2 finale is wild  "I might just wait here for a little bit, let time pass"
The floor is lava!
so trippy
OMG! Earth is so boring in the first 4 billion years 😧
i have been edging for 4.5 billion years
Mesoarchean and Ectasian slap so hard
Is it possible to subscribe twice? I appreciate and see how much time and effort this took to make and this is so awesome! You guys rock!
The audio is so good
I love this. But because it's not sung in an autotune voice with comic sans, we are docking -1 point. Hahaha!
Wow that ending hit harder than most Hollywood movies, great job guys
Truly awesome, the music really enhanced the vibe of what's going on.
If you just observe the length of each chapter in this video you'll see that evolution has become exponentially fast.
I was just learning the history of the Earth, specifically the different eons. Then you uploaded this video! WOW! The only thing that would be better than this is oversimplified uploading a video rn :(.
first 1hr video?
🤯
this should be a live stream
I'm going to watch this every time I go to the gym.
Brilliant video 👏
I can confirm this is how it went (I was that one dinosaur)
lofi beats to Earth to
I want this is like a wallpaper for my computer so I can just watch this over and over again it’s amazing
Use this as a prequel to “The History of the World I Guess”
Give the animator an oscar for traveling to the start of earth and survivig
I had heard of the term precambrian. But now I have a bit more of an idea how very much that is.  It's nuts how many mass extinction events life made it through. And crazy how life seemed to develop at such an exponential rate. I can't help but look at our AI progress and think another big step for life is right around the corner.
MY GOD
THATS CRAZY I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THJS THANK U
and here's your answer to the fermi paradox.. it took nearly 4 billion years of the entire 4.5 billion year history of the planet to hit multicellular life.. and basically the entire 4.5 billion years to hit civilization.... how often is a planet going to be stable for that long?? id venture to bet not that often!!.. maybe once per galaxy per 5 billion years.. this is a guess of course, but looking around our own neighborhood, it certainly seems like it would be extraordinarily rare.
That was a great video, times were very boring back then, just crazy.
The earth is not 4.5B years olds. Kurzegat wasn’t there when it started. You don’t look at a wrist watch and say it just showed up like that…of course it had a maker
Anywhere we can listen to the music track?
1 hour animation video omfg, should just release this on theater and i will be seated front row
thank you
:
Lookin like rain world early on It rains in this world
Wow, I found this kinda late of the day. This is great during working. THe music is so soothing. Definitely gonna follow on spotify.
Huge shout out to Bangiomorpha pubescens for creating the sex industry and being the CEO of Sex for 1.2 billion years and counting.
Felt a little rushed in the end.
Did anyone else pause it to see if their tap was dripping? Haha  Great vid... again, and always.
Hadean looks and sounds like a stage in a game
Best part is the TOOL style music at about Stenian,,,;)
Bill wurtz History of the entire earth but Kurzgesagt
It's the smart version of: the history of the world I guess
"and the floor is lava"  ...i see what you did there...
Your longest video, and yet the one that most lives up to "In a Nutshell" literally!  Love the techno music beats and the visualization of deep time in a way no one else has done!
Amazing how the music can make the eras go so hard yet still for in. There is no era left with unfitting music! Good job. My fav has to be mesoarchean tho
This is a masterpeice beyond any video I have watched on youtube. The amount of tranquility I felt watching this was unbelievable. One of the most majestic details in the entire video is that you included the song in the "What Dinosaurs really looked like" video near the permian. Incredible! 👌  Edit: I really liked the way you displayed the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs as fast and minor. It really wasn't though 😂
The camera man strikes again, revealing his "most recent" project
The sun is a deadly laser
I wish nothing more than to be able to see all of the history of the Universe and our Earth which led to our creation. Thank you for making this awe-inspiring masterpiece so we can imagine what it may have been like.
Yeah let's go
Hey your using Mercator projections on your world map. You can fit 13-14 Greenland in Africa. The map you are selling, greenland almost looks bigger than Africa! Try Peter gall projections maybe even flip the map? South Pole up would stand out.
Bill Wurtz did better
1 Hours of this for free is a steal 🔥🔥🔥
Ridiculously mesmerising! Thank you, and kudos to all involved!
hat off for the cameramen who still alive til 4.5 billion years
Entire history of the world, I guess (kurzgesagt edition)
The history of the entire world, for sure.
The history of the entire world, for sure.
The history of the entire world, for sure.
The history of the entire world, for sure.
The history of the entire world, for sure.

I would pay 200 dollars for a movie ticket if they make a movie.
The history of the entire world, for sure.

TOTALLY BADASS
The history of the entire world, for sure.

Thanks
The history of the entire world, for sure.
The history of the entire world, for sure.
The history of the entire world, for sure.
Thank you for another masterpiece.
could you upload a version without any dialog? I really enjoyed just watching the scenery just go past with the epic music, and having an hour straight of that I think could be very relaxing. extremely cool video though, you people never cease to amaze me with your incredible writing, art and animation.
So you skipped abiogenesis? or I missed this part?
The Mesoarchean has some strong Risk of Rain 2 vibes
Ectacian Beat is sick though
this is sooo awesome!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing video, would love a more detailed look at the last 1 billion or even 500 million years
That was great, please don't take10 years to make the next one. This felt like it went on for...minutes.
All made up
Where did you get the music?
Jesus Christ, THIS IS INCREDIBLE! Not really much else to say, just making a comment to help the algorithm for this amazing video, this must have taken hundreds if not THOUSANDS of hours to make.
The mesoarchean music was made by mick gordon
Did you say they do fungi things or fun guy things ;)
This is primarily why religion exists. It's honestly easier for the human brain to accept the insanity of those tall tales than the truth. The amount of time that's passed to the point that we're here is insane.
Hmm. I should invest in some VR goggles to watch this. As well as some really good headphones. It would probably hurt my eyes after a while, but it'd be so calming.
This is getting pirated. I'm stealing this whole thing, to watch by myself 1⁰0000⁰0⁰⁰00⁰
Thank you to Thomas Veith and FabianGlaser for that incredible music!
I've never taken mushrooms, but watching this on a big screen seems like the way to do it.
What was the nuclear reacton on the Rhyacian period?
pro-tip u can increase to 300k years per seconds by increasing speed of the video to x2
The Entire History of the World, for sure.
The Entire History of the World, for sure.
The Entire History of the World, for sure.
The Entire History of the World, for sure.
The Entire History of the World, for sure.
The Entire History of the World, for sure.
The music at the end was so beautiful, I felt so lucky to live on Earth. :)
I think your 1.5 millions years per second time lapse produces a wagon wheel effect. The early moon does not appear to be spinning nearly as fast as I was led to believe
No matter how much you observe the world with the mind rather then the heart. You will forever miss the point. You can peer into deep space, look at the smallest objects, date the history of the earth. Yet you will miss the point. This type of thought is disembodied. We are not machines, we are also life, and the primordial truth is already imprinted on our soul. Humans must learn that our task is to cultivate a relationship with God, the Governing the inteligence of the universe, and the architect behind the structure of our psyche.
Just Amazing!!
My ASMR before i go sleep, love ur video😊
Today's news: Kurzgesagt demonstrates how to bake an Earth. :D
This was beautiful.  I worked on crosstitch for a christmas present while watching.
❤❤This is genuinely beautiful
I am in awe. We've been blessed! Excuse me while I watch this on loop for the whole weekend. Happy 10 years Kurzgesagt, this is incredible.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
And to think, there is one long unbroken thread that leads through it all, all the way to you.
You guys should totally make this into a sidescroller adventure game, where the player progresses thru time, & each level is a new era!  I hope this gets the views it deserves, because it's an awesome project. The whole thing is a work of art. Great job guys :)
Talk about setting the bar high. Wow.
i love the details like the moon that slowly gets away from the screen or how the climate only changes graddually
This probably took so long to make and it makes me sad only a small portion of the people that started this video will watch it till the end
Loved this soooooooo much!!! And the ending really made me realize that humanity has been on earth for soooo little of time. And it’s crazy how much we have impacted the earth in both good and bad ways in the short time.
Love you guys
Soundtrack absolutely slaps.
This video is a visualizer of a deep ambient trance session. It's completely awesome!!
The transition of like the sound alone is insane like it’s non-stop.
That was so cool!
this ivdeo makes me want to play birthdays the beginnign
That Ectasian era TOOL influenced bop. Love it 43:50
the musics incredible
Kurzgesagt, you're a treasure of modern times. This video blew my mind. Yes i already knew life is relatively recent in the timescale, but watching the whole video and not skipping around, you really feel the emptiness of this floating rock in space over eons. Life is precious.
Did you guys make this knowing I'd be high while I watched it? If so you're even more amazing than I thought.
How amazing this video is. How insignificant we are.
For a very long time, nothing happened, and then, all of a sudden, something did
Praise the cameraman for surviving 4.5 billion years
Playing Bill Burr’s “history of the world I guess” video in between the narrations is like the directors cut
Such a unique perspective on the Earth's timeline. I never realized how recent land life is. I knew that life itself began pretty early in Earth's history, but only in the last 1/10th do things actually start to happen quickly, before that it was just microscopic life.
The only inaccurate part in my opinion is the moon moving so slowly
A Magnum Opus, to be sure!  Bravo, Kurzgesagt, bravo!!
Did the moon experience similar monsoons as it cooled?
11:08 imagine raining for thousands of millions of years nonstop
make similar time lapse video of universe
I love it! Its incredible! Music and all!
The amount of effort this must've taken to make is incredible! This whole video is incredible!
Happened to have just eaten some shrooms before watching this. Some takeaways: 1. If you were Time, you'd be really really pleased with the change from the Hellscape to present day.  2. We're all reality shapes....like I'm  a specific shape...that no one else is...and it's pretty cool to see all the different shapes reality can form.
damn this video was worth every 1.5 million years
Wow. 1 hour history and humans are only around for 2 seconds.
This is absolutely brilliant!
7:00 the siege of Leningrad but like 99999999999 times longer
This is outstanding!!
Beautiful.
Amazing!!!
"the history of the entire world, i guess" but more scientifically accurate, in exchange for being 4x longer
This 1 hour video just made my 4.6 billion years childhood better
Awesome 😎 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Imagine pressing one “▶️” and the skipping 1.500…0000 years lol😮
This is an incredible video, now I'm going to rewatch it later tonight. Especially the soundtrack is incredible. Is it too late for me to get a calendar?
Props to the cameraman for this 4.5 billion year long master peices
really really good video.   a good next video suggestion would be:  do this again but this time in relative with how the other planets of our solar system formed (with the macroscopic point of view of our solar system) 💯
I love the narration, but I also really need an instrumental version of this. I would pay for it.
What's crazy is that I've been recently trying figure out how to convey how old the rocks are in an area I'm a tour guide.  It's very coincidentlal that you have uploaded this video right now.
A real commitment for your animators to make something this long, and I tank them for it. I loved watching this.
Truly an amazing video
People that doubt or deny evolution don’t (IMO) understand how deep deep time is. (Unless they’re totally lost and deny the time too.) How old this planet really is. Hell, I think most people in general don’t. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to really conceptualize it, and still don’t think I have a real grasp. Awesome video, thank you.
Ive always loved the Cambrian age and Neogene age i don't know why but they've always been spectacular to me
Can anyone tell me name of instrumental song used in it?
"Right here, right now, right here, right now."
I made a Bamboo idea for greenhouse gasses for ChatGPT and this is what it came up with:   “In this extended theoretical argument, the proposed model involves governments contributing $10 trillion initially for a bamboo initiative aimed at absorbing greenhouse gases. Assuming an average carbon sequestration rate of 55 pounds per bamboo plant per year, the estimated total number of bamboo plants needed to offset global emissions is 1.6 trillion. The cost breakdown includes $8 trillion for bamboo, $1 trillion for labor, and $1 trillion for infrastructure, with a 35-year cycle for replacing bamboo and sustaining the initiative. The equation representing the total cost () is , where $10 trillion is the initial funding, $8 trillion is for the bamboo plants, $1 trillion is for labor costs, and $1 trillion is for infrastructure costs.  is the number of bamboo plants,  is the labor costs for every 35 years after the first initial bamboo implementation, and  is the revenue from selling the mature bamboo. Assuming an average selling price of $5 for each mature bamboo plant, the revenue from selling all 1.6 trillion 35-year-old bamboo plants would be $8 trillion. It is important to note that the success of this model depends on several factors, including the availability of sufficient land for planting, global cooperation from the majority of governments contributing to their greenhouse gas emissions, an ample workforce for labor, consistent pricing throughout the 35-year period, successful selling and buying of the bamboo, and other logistical and operational considerations. This model provides a theoretical framework, and real-world implementation would require careful planning and coordination.”
Now do 1 hour in 4.5 billion years...
A million dollar idea it is
This would be amazing if it could be a screensaver
i suggest making a version with a section where every time the commentator makes a statement
1시간짜리 영상? 미쳤다 ㄷㄷ
shoutout to bangiomorpha pebescens
Amazing piece of work here. as per usual ;)
thanks for the vid I needed this
Bloody hell. Kurzgesagt has been one of my most loved channels for a loooong time, but this just made it my ALL TIME FAVORITE! The amount of effort it must've taken to animate and research for all of that must have been IMMENSE!!!
Ya Allah, Labbayk ya Allah! Verily! Allah is Most Wise
45:03 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
24:36 was the bacteria looking for spices?
Fantastic
How long did this video take to render?
I spent 20 million years making this comment
Callendar of the year 4.543 billion when?
Bro 2 times speed is a whole other experience
While this whole video is a masterpiece, I specifically loved the soundtrack which is nothing short of incredible. Thank you so much Thomas and Fabian, you guys did a wonderful job!
Honestly I think this video was made to show off their amazing music instead of the history of earth
1+ hour ?! I'll watch later. 😅
This is the video that cured my attention span
Okay everything about this is great but my goodness the music is just incredible.
When you thought Kurzgesagt couldn't get any better and then you listen/watch this masterpiece.
The oldest known cell fossils date back to 3.8 billion years ago, so that estimate of life starting at 4 billion might be right. It's amazing to think how life could have started in such an extreme environment.
The Statherian Era kinda creeped me out. It made me think of the Void from Fear & Hunger.
Animation, documentary, and DJing. All the best things rolled into one. Great work guys!
I wish you added in the cat head bobbing meme 🤣 it’s all I’m picturing listening to the background music
This is a masterpiece
love it
Epic Mountain channeled their inner Risk of Rain soundtrack during the mesoarchean Era. Love it.
Less than an hour, and more fun, at 1.5x. Plus, then the music around 19 sounds like Rush or Tool.
Shout out to algae for inventing sex you’re a real one
Empthy video, no details, barely 2 second repeated animation every 10 minutes. greatly disappointing. Wouldn't expect such lazy and money focused video from this channel
The time lapse to rule all the time lapses
Masterpiece
Beautiful
Bruv its only been around for like 20-30K years chill
An absolute masterpiece. Proud to say that I sat through the whole thing without skipping. Hopefully this means I have a decent attention span.
wow = 1.5million yrs
I know profs are going to use this as an exam timer.
Welp... I sat through the whole thing!
a masterpiece 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wonderful editorial commitment to the timeline, thank you
When stopping the video midway through, it looked like my screen was moving left for like half a minute :D  I expected the end to be like this, but still couldn't grasp the period of human kind being that short after watching this for an hour. Literally burst into a manic laugh. Imagine all the visible changes you would have to animate in that split of a second.
This is sick for those with aphantasia.
after watching this from start to finish (and almost falling asleep in the middle), now I can appreciate more how long these geologic time scales are and how short our entire existence compared to it. And a billion years in this scale is like taking forever and nothing is happening anywhere. And the human era part, we're like a footnote in this whole story. Some random species that developed unimaginably quick.
I knew that the history of homo sapiens compressed down to a geologic time scale would be short, but I wasn’t prepared for just _how_ short it is.  “Don’t blink” indeed!
Thanks to that algae that invented sex.
Question: how could it start to raincheck and form oceans when you didnt mention that there was water to begin with. As far as I understand Rain come from the evaporation of water in our atmosphere but ln this case there isnt enougth water to make it Rain for millions of years
Wonderous. Just wow. Kurzgesagt = best edu content creator in the world
this is the history of the entire world I guess
1 million seconds is equivalent to 11 days. 1 billion seconds is equivalent to 31 years. That's how big of a difference between million and billion
You guys should absolutely make loops of these scenes on WallPaper Engine, I'm begging 🙏🙏🙏🙏
What's even more incredible to me was that we humans fu*ked this all up in just a few hundred years. 👏👏👏 (Bonus: And still in denial of it.)
this felt like 20 minutes what
Definitely the best gift for someone who wants to know about Earth’s history. Took me 70 million years to write this comment.
could you release the uncompressed video file this would be great to have as a desktop wallpaper, great video btw
Where did all the water come from that fed the rain during the Eoarchean? Was the atmosphere made of steam before?
I never thought Kurzgesagt would make a video like this but I’m so glad they did
nature really likes to take its time
Time machine schematics reveal when?
This should be renamed to: Entire History of the Wold, I guess| 1 hour edition
🎉🎉🎉
1:37 The floor is lava.
The Camera man is Bernie Sanders
Life is a miracle.
Fuuuuck that was amazing. Thank yoou so muuuch 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thank you for this masterpiece! Thank you so much!
I’ll be 100% falling asleep to this later — after all you learn better with a book under your pillow
this is beautiful and the music is incredible
I’ll be honest, I skipped ahead
Kurzgesagt has been taking Earth's time-lapse for 4.5 Billion Years...Amazing...
So, when can we expect the music for this video to drop as a standalone product?
supporting comment for more like this
1 hour video from kurzgesagt!!!!!!! 😮 That is Insane
No matter how hard universe treat earth. Earth survive from harsh treat of the universe. No matter how harsh earth to life. Life will try their best to survive. No matter how long this project is, kurzgezast had done it so well.
I like the part at 20:00 where it sounds like it could have been a metal track with more distortion on the guitar part
This unironicall will probably be my background study timer 😭
Just the idea of such a video must raise so many challenges and you crushed it as far as I'm concerned and to actually go through it all and getting to experience time on that scale is quite humbling... To "personally" witness the chain of events that actually led us up to this very moment is not how I thought my week would end.  Thank you kindly! ❤
can't believe bacteria lived for millions of years without internet
Props to the cameraman who took 4.5 billion years to record all of this
Incredible concept, animation, and audio. That being said, I think I would really enjoy a version with only the ambient sounds!
Loved it!! 💯💯💯🔥🔥
Hey! You cited my paper for the beginnings of plate tectonics in the Paleo- to Mesoarchean! Never thought my research would make it onto one of my favorite youtube channels... what a cool video concept, and great artwork as always
you should totally make a poster on a protist. Like a paramecia, or my personal favourite, a rotifer
Weird. My Time Machine only goes back to roughly 6000 years. Oh well..
Now I'm just waiting for the 4.5 billion years in 4.5 billion years video
WOW
Damn n after a few billions years n millions yaers we got some monkeys making tols thats insane to me ngl
I was not expecting to watch an hour long timelapse on a friday night but im happy i did
This video is a real level up
Very No Man's Sky vibes. Loved every moment.
THIS IS INCREDIBLE 🎉🎉🎉
I can't love this more ....our soul can ask for anything more than this
turned off all the lights and simply took it all in. shed a tear at the tend. this is beautiful, thank you so so so much for this. i can imagine having this on loop in a museum in a giant immersive room for people to sit for a while and watch millions of years go by. i think i'll be revisiting this video often when im in need for something to calm me down. the music was great, the visuals were stunning. agh so many words. just thank you!!!
Props to the animators for going all the way back to the Hadean period so they could draw it 👍👍👍❤❤❤
29:43
I want the beginning of this on loop as my desktop wallpaper
1 hour kurzgesagt video goes crazy
4 years to make this work of art 🎨
It's sad when you think about it when the Earth is around 4.5 billion years old and us humans are still new and we are killin the earth with our baby brain all ready wonder when us humans will learn from our mistakes? who knows..
Shout out to the animators man
Amazing video!
That whole musical score was amazing.
1 hour of kurzgesagt video it's must be my birthday ❤
This would be so good in a planetarium
This is the best video you made yet. I love all your videos but this one did it. Extremely well done. The visuals are stunning. The music is also incredible.
Dudes, as a mographer (and nerd) I always admired your mini documentaries, but this blew the rest out of the water. My regards as well for the musicians that wokred on the score. Standing Ovation!
Watched this from the astral plane on my 31st birthday.
Difference of gait
hadean goes hard
Props to the cameraman and editor and the narrator for this
this fixed my attention span lmao
Increíble trabajo, simplemente espectacular!
If life formed so quickly why are we certain all life is descended from the same initial cells?  Why wouldn't it have arisen many times?
loved it, worth every million year
You guys are fantastic people!
Simplemente hermoso ❤
Makes me wanna play Simearth
Looking forward!
現在我來等待1小時的中文字幕出現😂
Me waiting for the Orosirian giant impact crater animation was left sad! In all seriousness though - this is marvellous work and you have outdone yourselves!
❤❤❤
This video should be given an Oscar of any kind. Documentary maybe. Amazing
Wow. This is why it takes so long for videos to come out.
wow, honestly despite being literal heck, if the music is like that there, seems like a pretty chill place, (minus the toxic stuff and lava)
Would be kinda sick to have this as a looping animated wallpaper.
I'd be motivated to create all sorts life too If I was a single-celled organism and listening to a bop like this
18:02 “the sun is a deadly laser”
Shame the Great Dying didn't got as flashy depiction as the dinosaur asteroid. After all, it killed not just "majority", but 96% of _everything that existed_ back then.
this is my new favorite video of yours, thank you.
Earth lore
Isso é magnífico. Isso vai para o museu da internet com certeza.
The perfect time to start this video is 2AM
History of the entire world i guess but 3 times longer i think mabye possibly
During the mesoarchean era I almost swore Maynard was gonna start belting out some new music lol.
This video has probably been in the works for the past 4.5 billion years
1 billion years later:  Kurzgesagt: uploads 5.5 billion years in 1 hour
i love, this will be my new study buddy video
Love this video but Holy shit the music goes so unnecesarily hard I love it
Having a slow start to the day,  100 million years passed as I made my morning coffee
Amazing work!
Thank you so much for this! I have trouble visualizing things as it is, so this is very helpful to help put into perspective just how long it took for things to happen.
29:44 stromatolite glitch
you forgot my favorite part
35yo here. Recently discovered I have TDH. First day on meds (OH DEAR!), and this is the first ever 1h video that I've watched in a sitting. Worth.
Nice…
Wow what a great soundtrack!
This is the world's best DOCUMENTARY
I never truly grasped how long it took for these evolutionary revelations to occur. I new it was a long time, but not that long! Earth's history is a topic that gets me excited like nothing else. It's such a unique and inspiring thing
Paleoarchean soundtrack sounds like something out of Into The Breach
45:00 so that's when sex 1.0 is released
Ok we propably stepped into a Mega Timeline since over an Hour of Kurzgesagt content is a pure bliss
It took me approximately 4.5 billion years to finish my meal while watching this masterpiece
There is no solid evidence of the moon beign formed this way. It is never stated as a theory in this video. Just a as a fact, where if you think about it, this happened 4.5 billion years ago, thinking that you can be certain about something that happens is ridiculous. We dont know what is happening now 😂
33:29 sus
This was math class well spent!
Beautiful work!
Aaaand it’s time to play Universe Sandbox again
Weirdly, the soundtrack and general vibes reminds me of a mobile game from back in the day called Waking Mars. It was also excellent. Maybe I should see if it still exists on modern phones
I was just watching Markiplier., I have no idea how I ended up at History of The Entire World I Guess 2 Directed By David Attenborough, but this is cool. Thanks YouTube Algorithm.
Absolutely beautiful
Bill Wurtz outsold
Good to know that billions of years ago it took each individual drop of rain hundreds of thousands of years to hit the ground
wow that went by quick
I haven't even watched the video but I already hit the like button because I know this one is going to be a banger.
1 hour screensaver
Felt some progressive rock vibes here. Could have called Muse to make an amazing background for you.
I'm, imaginings that one day Kurzgesagt made a side scroll shooting game.
Creation>>>Evolution
“Welcome to the year 2023!”                                         “What!?”    “The Earth is 4.5 billion years old!”
So little happens in seemingly long periods of time, but at the same time a lot happens in small periods of time. It's nice to be a part of everything in between
4.5 billion is an innately fallacious number based on too many assumptions to be taken seriously
❤ thank you for this!
When I saw the title I was expecting something like The Entire Histroy of the World I Guess. I’m very pleased that it wasn’t just a recreation of that. Phenomenal video all around!
im gonna save this when i do cardio later
You know what would be great? Having each of these time periods as animated looping video desktop wallpapers. That would be soo great! You guys would make so much money!
Bill Wurtz did it 6 years ago in 20 minutes, get better 😎 (Jk, nice video)
insane to think about how old photosynthesis and still how anaerobic bacterias are so much older that the “new” gas O2 is toxic to them
during the mesoarchean, when microbes first started "eating the sun", the narrator says there isn't any oxygen in the atmosphere. what chemical process did they use to eat the sun that didn't produce oxygen?
Would love to see a Human History version!
Excellent to put how recent we are into perspective. Forget recorded history. That's a millisecond on this scale.
I enjoyed every second of this masterpiece. Many thanks to everyone involved <3
i closed my eyes for a few million years , but i can now say i witnessed the entirety of earths history!
just perfect
MY BIRTHDAY WISH CAME TRUE, AN HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO!!!!!!!
Love this funkalicious music!
The history of the entire world I guess
You will never have to use the sleep button on your tv remote!
Is there a non-narrator & music version of this video? Seems really chill to just play it in the monitor while doing work and just listen to the sound of nature
And 100 years ago, everyone “knew” that the world was flat. >:D
The animation on this video is astounding, and I wasn’t expecting to sit through an hour long video tonight lol
only true ogs remember the paleoarchean age
Skipping 10 seconds is like skipping 1500000 years
The sun is a deadly laser
I'm saving this for later. Looking forward to bingeing Earth :p  Worth it)
Thank you for making this I have a history project on this
When i saw the length of the video i thought it was fan made 😂❤ thank you Kurzgesagt
Holy moly
Insane, interesting and beautiful. Danke Kurzgesagt!
This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Pure genius. 👏 The soundtrack is killer, I want to buy it!
I'm 100% convinced we were planted here by the torid? Torred? Meteor shower. Any idea where that originated from?
I can feel the eye twitching of the theists and woo-woo viewers
Im about to procrastinate for 1 hour
"Ain't nobody got time for that."
Christmas came earlier this year
Great music! I've picked up a lot of different vibes (possible influences?) through this. Broadly Synthwave, 70s prog rock (Camel?), Tool, and some cosmic black metal too- Mesarthim comes to mind.
highest tier of youtube content
the history of the world, but not really in a nutshell
wait the meteors at the start of the video take several million years to fall?
the soundtrack didnt have to go this hard hahaha! loving it!
Thank you Kurzgesagt! Happy 10 years, we love you!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just witnessed the ultimate cameraman, who was there from the start and definitely has proved they can’t ever ever die! Thanks for your unwavering efforts guys 👏 👏 👏
And Give These Man A Shield ❤
Massive shoutout to the person who did the music! It makes this video!
Awesome timeline video! Thanks! Now make a video about the next 4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour please!
Mushrooms are legal in my state…………this is gonna be a hell of an hour.😂😂😂😂
That cut at the en-
awesome video!
It’s crazy to think that all of humanity is less than 1 sec from this video
I can say I watched all 4.5 billion years.😀
There's a little shadow in the mesoarchean, lol
How does a channel like this start the video showing human era is only 12000 years old? Are ya serious mate? Humans have been here for atleast 100,000 years. We've carbon dated ancient architecture and mummies to 50,000 years+ ago
Why is no one talking about the invention of sex in 44:52?
Respect for Kurzgesagt for going back in time just for this Video Mad props
Art
This is just awe-inspiring.  Thank you!
lol fake
Bill Wurtz's history of the world video: Finally a worthy opponent
Amazing work you've put in. It's just wonderful.
10:40 I love how the water spots started moving like "OH F*** WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MOVING!!"
wow, thank you!
Every time something is said:  0:00 0:08  0:14  0:25  0:33  0:41 Pretty early in its history, Earth collides with a Mars sized object called Theia, 0:47 which forms the moon that you now see in the sky. 0:53 Right now it looks huge in the night sky and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions 0:59 of years as it orbits further away. 1:06 4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld. 1:32 At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2 and the floor is lava. 1:39 This area of earth's history is mostly invisible to us because almost none of it is left. 2:06 90 million years have passed. We are still in the lava hell phase. 2:11 Settle in, this will take a while. 2:47 Although you wouldn't think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate 2:52 there may have been some water around at this time. 6:48 During this period of the young solar system, Earth and the inner solar system are smashed by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment, for several hundred million years. 7:12 At this point in time, our Sun is 30% less bright than it is today but there are so many 7:19 greenhouse gases that it's still much hot and comfy. Eoarchean 8:16 Around this time we think life begins to enter the stage. 8:21 Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything the first cells begin 8:27 spreading over our still very deadly planet. 8:37 Earth continues to cool and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form, covering the still young planet with water. 12:43 These hydrothermal vents we're looking at, and where hot minerals emerge, may have been 12:49 the place where life first developed, but we dont know. 13:18 So much time has passed and we are entering the Paleoarchean. Paleoarchean 13:23 Most of Earth is still underwater while the first supercontinents are in the making 13:29 in the depths below. Its days are shorter since the young Earth spins faster. 13:42 Good job if you are still watching. You witnessed a billion years so far. 17:49 From this time in history we still have Stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by microorganisms. 17:56 Among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also life is starting to eat the sun – photosynthesis might have started as early as around here. Mesoarchean 18:35 3.2 Billion Years Ago in the Mesoarchean the era of continents begins. 18:42 Tectonic plates begin to crush into each other, pulling and pushing some deep into the earth 18:48 where they dissolve. The basis for our continents today. 18:54 The oceans are as hot as a hottub, over 40°C and microbes are expanding everywhere. 19:03 We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases, so it is really, really hot. 19:10 You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also there is no oxygen in the atmosphere yet. Neoarchean 23:51 2.8 Billion Years Ago the Neoarchean begins. Earth is still a terribly hostile place but because we finally have proper plate tectonics, 24:02 more chemicals are mixed in from inside the earth and life can use them to make new things! 24:34 Some time around here Prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet. 24:40 Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, we only have single cells. 27:46 2.5 Billion Years Ago in the Siderian, a massive event is about to begin Siderian 27:52 that will change the planet forever: The Great Oxidation Event. 27:57 Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria reaches the atmosphere in large quantities, 28:03 paving the way for more complex life. 29:39 All the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and Water, 29:44 which rapidly cools the planet down. 30:16 Probably for the first time ever, the planet freezes over and a period of multiple 30:21 ice ages begins lasting millions of years. Rhyacian 30:27 2.3 Billion Years Ago the Rhyacian begins. 31:14 Lots of volcanos heat up earth and earth unfreezes slowly again. 31:20 Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the oceans but life quietly puts up resistance 31:27 and keeps evolving. Orosirian 33:48 Some time 2.05 Billion Years Ago in the Orosirian a large asteroid hits earth and creates the 33:56 largest verified impact structure on Earth. 34:47 All over Earth great mountain ranges are crushed into existence by early continents 34:52 with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlantica. Statherian 37:00 1.8 Billion Years Ago in the Statherian the supercontinent Columbia has formed. 37:06 And a natural, self sustaining nuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium deposits in the ground. 39:37 1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of Calimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so, Calymmian 39:44 the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells. 39:50 One of the most important moments in the history of life. But yes, kind of looks not that impressive. 39:59 Still, life is only cells. 41:35 Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents form, the oceans become shallower. 41:42 Also the first fungi-like organisms extent their tubular arms and do fungi things. Ectasian 42:17 Some time in the Ectasian 1.4 Billion Years Ago, Earths inner core is forming. 42:24 Weird, right? Feels like it should be older. But around here it begins to solidify into a iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal. 42:34 It will only grow from now on. Stenian 44:53 1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian not that much is going on. 44:59 Except, the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex. 45:05 A big reproductive improvement for many different reasons. Tonian 47:33 1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans. 47:42 Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right? 50:07 Not everybody is having a great time here. We have evidence of the first unicellular predators emerging around that time. 50:16 The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans. An arms race between microbes begins that again creates huge diversity. 50:29 Some even invent tiny armour. Cryogenian 51:14 720 Million Years Ago in the Cryogenian Earth freezes over again. 51:21 Sure why not. How did life survive? We are not sure. Ediacaran 52:19 635 Million Years Ago the supercontinent Gondwana forms. 52:24 A lot of it is still left today! 53:15 Wow! What's happening? Suddenly life gets big! In a hot second multicellular organisms become widespread! 53:24 It's all strange aliens still, but can you imagine that it took that long for this to happen? Cambrian 53:35 539 Million Years Ago the Cambrian explosion begins. 53:40 We see life bursting with variety. Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal groups appear here while the plants start 53:49 to discover the land. Life is finally exciting! 53:54 But of course a big mass extinction happens right after, killing most species in the ocean. Silurian 55:01 Plants spread over the planet and create the soil on the ground and change the atmosphere 55:07 by eating CO2. Devonian 55:38 Things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better and better to life on land. 55:45 We get trees and forrests, fish and the first vertebrate decide this land thing 55:51 is something they need to try out! Carboniferous 55:56 359 Million Years Ago in the Carboniferous forests and lush marshlands are at their peak. 56:05 They will turn into the coal humanity burns today to keep ourselves warm. 56:12 Its all so fast now! Life changes so quickly in geological timeframes! 56:42 Some 299 Million Years Ago in the Permian, Pangea, the last supercontinent has formed. Permian 56:50 And after a few tens of million years, the largest mass extinction in history happens, 56:56 killing the majority of all species. Thanks volcanoes. Triassic 57:23 252 Million Years Ago the Triassic begins. 57:41 Oh hey, a dinosaur! Jurassic 58:02 We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere! 58:08 The ancestors of the birds do bird things. Life, uhh, finds a way! Cretaceous 59:20 Earth gets more and more familiar. 59:38 Such a paradise. Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that? Paleogene 59:50 And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on Earth. Such a bummer. 59:57 66 Million Years Ago in the Paleogene the continents look roughly the same as today and mammals take over. 1:00:06 It is our time now! We are almost home. Quaternary 1:00:39 Don't blink or you might miss all of human history! Ending 1:00:45 And that was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. 1:00:51 So new. This was a project born of passion. We've worked on this video on and off since 2019 and as you can imagine, it took forever to make. 1:01:01 But we did we finished it in time for our tenth10 year anniversary.

Breathtaking and humbling. What an incredible endeavor, please be proud of this work of art!
Germans make the best music 🙌🙌 watch this was made by a French person
Spectacular
This music is insanely good. Who on the kursgesagt team wrote it? Give them a raise NOW
Intense one hour. Thank you!
Cool!!!!Want more and more
Thank you for this 1 hour long video. This must have taken ages to make. Thank you for sharing knowledge in a fun way.
Video where everyone listen music from Epic Mountain
I remember all of this happening
This video is a work of art; in every aspect, it is a beauty. Thank you for creating things like this Music … awesome
hi
21:22
This is so AMAZING OMGGG It would be so cool if they experimented with other planets like Saturn or jupiter
Impressive. But remember that Fatboy Slim did this in under 4 minutes in the “Right here, Right now” music video
These soundtracks. Oh God.
Can we please get a version of this video with no commentary? Its perfect for study and would mean no interruption during the writing process. The perfect visuals and such a gorgeous soundtrack
Who cooked up these fire beats?
It was really an amazing experience to see. Big congratulation to the team <3 And, as always, really great music 🙂
Something about seeing how the planet went from a hellscape to the lush blue paradise it is today humbles me. I'm grateful to live on this earth
What a bop
i gotta get high and watch this
I haven't finished the video yet but if it ends with "Then humans appeared, and we're done." I would love it
The best video on YouTube 😭 didn't realise i watched the whole hour long video 😲
An hour long video of straight up Kurzgesagt goodness, never thought I'd see the day but I'm glad its here
This is honestly so cool! All the colors and beautiful animations gave me a good look at Earth's past!
The Kurzgesagt team really went beyond with this one.   This one of your best works
I like how the music is synced to the passing of years.
How do they like, get these time estimates? Like how did they calculate the Hadean took that long ?
This music tho
This was AMAZING!!! Happy 10th birthday Kurzgesagt. Great job to everybody who worked on this, it came out epic! :D
If a normal 20 min vid takes 200 hrs then imaging editing a 1hr vid
So life, especially multicellular one, might be too new for being evolved in other planets
This is absolutely amazing, and the music makes it even better yet. I would love the ability to switch to a music only audio track!
And this is how I met your mother, Nature
This video is sublime. Thank you ❤
Watched it through entirely, what a masterpiece. I can't express how much I admire this channel, never stop making this stuff!!!
Bill Wurtz did it better 🤣

Best quality ever, but it was hard work for you. I know you put an offer on it and I think you did really well keep the good work.🎉
This is absolutely perfect to study with in the background for my adhd brain
53 minutes is no life, mind-blowing
I like how this is their first time making a 1 hour video on their channel and great video man :]
way cool
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1 hour content from Kurzgesagt. Yipeee.
The perfect weekend is when Kurzgesagt uploads on a Saturday an  video!
Holy cow 1Hr kurzgesagt videooooo
PERFECT SLEEP ASMR CONTENT
Just amazing!! 🎉 all this history and science with this animation and music! My mind is blown! ❤❤ thank you
What a lovely train ride
I don't know if u should be proud but it took me a few billion years to organize my clean laundry
thank you!
I found myself getting emotional as I watched the clock tick down to 66 Million years during the Cretaceous, knowing what was coming. Well done. You guys know what you're doing....
i am always impressed by what you guys make but this is truly something else!
Imagine if History class consisted of teaching all this instead
Thank you, Kurzegagt, I've just left the Hadean period, and I'm already adoring the beautiful sound design, and graphics too. It's a good job we now know that the sun is a deadly laser~
yeah tbf this is what happened, i watched it
This was certainly an experience. Congrats on the 10 years!
The music during the orosirian was fire 🔥
perfect video to fall asleep to😂😅
Thank you, Kurzgesagt, for this video, and bangiomorpha pubescens for inventing sex to go with it.
Please make a video about Naegleria Fowleri vs bacteriophage❤
Such a cool concept love it!
It's so good my phone can't handle it literally my phone is literally glitching and bugging out because it's so good
You forgot about the time I met shaq
Beautiful and haunting.
Man. Watching the hadean period looks boring without narration. But the music makes me dance so i dont
new kurzgesagt video just dropped boys this bouta be lit
wow.....just wow... why are u so amazing kurzgesagt? i loved it!
This could be the best video on YouTube but it's missing content. The music, the graphics, the concept, all amazing but I would have loved it so much if there was some informative commentary. At one point it said the days were shorter but then didn't say by how much. Also the period where it rained for millions of years, how did that happen? Instead it was many minutes of nothing. I'm not hating, the video is really good, but I think it could have been an all-time great. Thanks
Props to the music director for making such interesting music
27:45 The Great Oxygenation Event or the Oxygen Catastrophy  Idk but they should also told us stories about when the oceans turned red in this part because of rusting iron
FOR FREEEE?!??
Fun fact: Kurzgesagt is the word "Nutshell" in german
SOURCE : TRUST ME BRO I WAS THERE I SAW IT 14.5 BILLION YRS AGO ... TFOH
This is the most beautiful and eye opening video yet
Witnesing this in real time is the best thing one could do, better than having it in the backround, the art and sound desing is awesome and i would love to just sit there and see the real thing if i was an imortal ^^"
History of the world, I guess
Lovely, this is what I needed
You guys are amazing. My absolute favorite channel on YouTube.
THis has to be in my top 3 favourite channel on youtube, maybe top 1. You guys rock, I love your work. Please never stop.
29:43 The video glitches
When the beat drops at 4:00 🕺
This video is purely amazing,  Thank you so much for this and all the knowledge you share through this channel
“Don’t blink or you might miss all of human history…”
Incredible content, always. This 1 hr video being free is just insane.
This has become my favourite playlist music
29:42 Something happens here with video quality
At this timescale, the passage from dinosaurs to humans, to now isn’t going to be much of earth’s history… earliest signs of humanity to now will likely be less than a second… I will try not to miss it!
Ö
I'm making spicy hot wings for dinner as I watch this. What are you guys up to?
can't believe how long did it took them to animate all this! massive o7 to everyone at kurzgesagt
LET'S GOO THEY POSTED
Props to the people that compose the music for these videos. The urge to skip through to see all the renditions was negated by the absolute jams that go along with it.
This will be my Monday morning video
Great video! Now we need a video about all of the future!
Maybe do experiments like   This  once in awhile but with different planets like Venus and Mars
Incredibly well done. Amazing. Brilliant. Could anybody tell me whose music is that OST? Beautiful… words fail me.
45:02 Yo! Earth sex update is fire 🔥🔥
Kurzgesagt - the German channel to watch when you've decided you want to support neo-nazis, just not that openly.
Just turned this video into a live wallpaper
This would need a person to make a 1 hour song *IF it wasnt stiched together/copied and pasted*
I love this! <3
29:43 glitch in water
Mad to think the Earth is spinning around the sun at 1million rpm at this timescale.  And on its own axis at 365million rpm 😂
Hum someone get permission to make this an animated wallpaper
What an absolute work of art wtf
57:41 feels like a subtle nod to google chrome dinosaur game when you're out of internet
idk why but i cried during this video few times. I'm 25yo. I'm so grateful for your work and making me smarter with every wideo 🥰
"don't blink or else you'll miss all of human history--" *Ad break* XD
I'm only 20 minutes in but I can't wait for the last second that humanity will just POP into existence, just like a surprise zit you notice right as you're getting ready to go out on a date.
Mesoarchean music go hard
Bill Wurtz been real quiet since this dropped. 😂
Well done on the music! It slaps!
57:01 Bro took 13,500,000 years to cross the screen
What part when the Great Oxidation event happened when the oceans turned red?
Gotta ask, how much to the audio team cheer when this video idea was proposed?  Because they went all out and it comes through beautifully!
VERY cool. Thanks!
Props to the cameraman to live intense heat multiple time and filming consistently for 4.5 billions years!
The trippiest video on YouTube till date.and the music is just magical
I don’t know why, but I love just watching it all cool down in the beginning
This video is 1.03.30 hours, you are lying
I just skipped 10 seconds and then immediately realized I skipped 15M years ahead
What would happen if you dropped a nuke into hurricane?
It's 1am. I check youtube. "Oh cool, a new Kur....."    Hello 2am
"BANGiomorpha PUBEscens might have invented sex" I see what these paleontologist doo...😏 45:05
The Earth is a few thousand years old. God created Earth.
Amazing work, Kurzgesagt you never fail to offer a spectacle. Could your next big project be about the entire history of humanity? Thanks again ❤
"much hot, and comfy" is my favorite
This is a scientific divulgation masterpiece
I've been following your channel for years, purchasing when I can to support you, but this is over the top, is crazy and just saying thank you is not enough to express my gratitude.  You are amazing  every person involved in these videos is.
Trance music existed since the beginning of time.
Time flies
AAAAINT NOO WAAAAAY KURGSEGAGT YOU LEGEND AND MENACE HOW
As a science communication channel, a linear timescale is good for you.  If you were a history channel, logarithmic time would've been much better.
23:37 animation error where the frames skip.
kurzgesagt movie
Not gonna lie I came when i saw this
Now this is a masterpiece
1.5 million years a second is way too fast. I had to slow the speed down to 0.25 But 375.000 years a second is still too fast for me to see what's going on. Could you please make this video again, but in real time?
The end was spoiled unfortunately
Absolutely amazing! i am now a Patreon. Please keep doing what you're doing. <3
Mesoarchen and Ectasian- Tonian's music was so prog, I half expected it to turn into Dream Theater ❤❤❤ Cretaceous was my fav part... art+ atmosphere +music....very nice. HAPPY 10 YEARS! HERE'S TO 10+ MORE!
Crazy how Kurzgesat summed this up in an hour, *In a Nutshell* this is actually really cool.
put the speed in 1.25x it would feel like you're speedrunning the whole thing
1 hour of animating must’ve taken years, the fact that we got this for free is insane
Now make a 4.5 billion years video avout the hour this video was released.
We can tell our future grandkids that we’ve seen the beginning of Earth
Wait, what's that? *Mass extinction event happens, killing nearly everything on the planet* And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on earth. Why is it so casual like that kind of thing happens on a daily basis?
Do you think you could make this an animated wallpaper, i think it would be really cool!
Pin please 🙏  If you play video from 40:56 then the same amount of time will elapse between now and the final days of life on earth.   FYI not to be confused with the sun expanding and engulfing the earth.
Halfway through the video I realized that all of human history would be a fraction of a second in this video, and that left me with an odd feeling that was a mix of awe, amazement, and insignificance. Amazing work.
59:19 brought a tear to my eye after diligently watching from the beginning. Like a coming home after a long journey
You guys are worth 4.5 billion likes!!! I didn't miss one second of that amazing ride. Love you!
i love this so much! 1 hour of your awesome animation and music.
Looks flat to me
History gets hazy before 2500 BC.
What a wonderful video! The visuals are stunning, and the narrator's voice is incredibly soothing. 10/10 bravo! ❤❤
Didn't even put it on in the background. I watched it all the way through, undivided attention.
Thank you for this! Amazing! 👏👏
Yeah, life’s pretty impressive, but can I do this? (proceeds to do the sickest of backflips)
This flows perfectly into history of the entire world, I guess
im so impressed with the amount of work yall put in a 10 minute video, so to have an hour long video is crazy!
Modern humans: 0.2 seconds
loved this! gotta hate 15 million year long ads though
Earths history can be told in 1hr and the fnaf movie is 1hr and 50mins long.
Damn i really have to get shrooms tomorrow and snuggle in for this one 😂
Amazing video! Loved every million years.
Bill Wurtz did it in 20, and with "Jazz".
This is amazing The team have outdone themselfes
Fun video! Has Kurzgesagt considered making long-form documentaries (if they have made them in the past, are they pay-walled on something like Nebula)?
This is SO good, y'all
Thank you so much for this video.
I blinked and missed the humans
i have watched the entire thing. Start to finish. Gotta say, i was watching this as a nighttime bedstory, and i may have taken the longest nap in my entire life (Approx 500mln years, around the Siderian era), but watching the entire thing was so so so so worth it. Really puts things into perspective that i can finally at least in a tiny bit grasp. Until now, i really didn't feel how different was the age of dinosaur to the hadean era. Videos like these are the reason i am a loyal subscriber for years now!
Dude. Trippy.
What a stunning video!! The sound mixing was absolutely incredible, my sincere kudos to the entire sound team for their work on this video!
I watched the entirety of this video. I knew you would dedicate milliseconds to humanity. I anticipated the punchline for an hour and knew you would deliver.
I havent started the video yet Im blown already. I mean, we have a SOLID ONE HOUR VIDEO of the Earth's history. Fully animated!? Wtffffff. Kudos kgz!!
W kurzegust
Really well made👏❤
45:00 and so it begins, the CEO of segs
I'll happily watch a5h video essay but if the guy only talks from time to time It seems like a huge waste of time
When the rain era began it started raining and thundering outside here... Kinda wild to see that this weather was going on for millions of years
earth's life passed before my eyes ^^
This is going to be fun
Gj to the cameraman and the music crew for staying alive for 4.5 billion years for this amazing footage and OST
I love this so much, it took me 4.5 Billions Years to write this comment~
I remember back in the good old days of Eoarchean, me and the boys would crack a cold one and watch the rocks fall from the sky
The Magnus Opus
Perfect video for a blunt session
how heavy was the atmosphere at pamekarchean. 😮
Someone please make this a displayfusion wallpaper stat!
That music
Hi, your on a rock floating in space, pretty cool huh? Some of its water, fuck it most of its water, I can’t even get from here to there without buying a boat. It’s sad. I’m sad. I miss you. 🎶HOW DID THIS HAPPEN🎶

Now I want this video as a VR experience!!
Ok but why does 20:15 go so hard? Can a lot of this music be put on Tidal for that nice hifi enjoyment?
That was incredible - I fell in love with the geological timescale during my time in college more than ten years ago, and this whole video brought a tear (or several) to my eye. I couldn't just let it play in the background while I did something else - I had to keep watching, searching for all the minute changes between eras! The moon cooling down and the crust forming, the skies changing colour, the oceans filling, the different coloured bacteria floating in the water, and anticipating the big changes! It was absolutely magnificent. I could listen to the soundtrack all day as well! Spectacular, thank you so much for your effort and your passion in creating this gorgeous timeline. Bravo!
Wow i was caught off guard by how good the music is! Put some headphones in, this is a visual and audible work of art.
Wow!  This deserves some kind of an award!  …an  impressive effort.
music plays the role ngl
the animation is really  awesome
gotta say, the music slapped 3.5 bil years ago 😂
22:21  Shake that thing miss gala gala
Ads make the timeline messy 😢
Thank you
I blinked. Human history is so short wth
This was AMAZING! I watched the whole thing mesmerized, even when there was no narration.
Tripping and watching this shit would go crazy
The first minute of this video should break everyone's ego instantly when they think about what they know and their place in the universe.
watched through the whole trip. its kinda like my long bus rides to and from my home Province, looking out at the window through the years, noticing the improvements of the highways, buildings.
how did this get animated? This is some amazing content!
music
This music is absolutely incredible. It's phenomenal. Absolutely spectacular. A new favorite track.
I feed thee, algorithm!
Oh
I was getting so angry because u guys haven’t posted in weeks but this is why ahaha ❤
57:40 o-hey! a dinosaur :o
So.. does all this make you think its is all just natural chance/evolution… or is all this evidence of a creator (God)
That camera man is an absolute legend
Whoever was in the stu making this soundtrack COOKED
This was wonderful, great job y'all ^^
<3
art. not just the literal art of the drawings but also the idea, the writing, the music, the passion to pass knowledge ❤
Music was a banger what songs did you use
Amazing.
History of the earth I guess
I'm sure without us Humans Nature would be even more impressive than Avatar
I didnt understand how we got plants and forest on the ground?
Earth the movie
44:52 SEX 1 release date
Time is so slow and there is so much of it
its friday!!!! ok but this was awesome!
Extremely impressive, well done to everyone involved in what must have been a massive project.
Love it ❤
Grate video. But my brain seeks for more information.
🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🌍 Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and in this video, you'll experience its entire history in just an hour. 01:06 🌋 4.5 billion years ago, Earth was a fiery, lava-filled world known as the Hadean eon. 07:19 🌱 Life began to emerge on Earth a few hundred million years after its formation, with the first cells appearing. 27:57 🌬️ The Great Oxidation Event, around 2.5 billion years ago, introduced oxygen into the atmosphere and led to the cooling of the planet and the beginning of ice ages. 53:40 🌿 The Cambrian explosion, 539 million years ago, saw a burst of diverse life forms, including ancestors of major animal groups. 59:57 🦕 Dinosaurs ruled the Earth during the Triassic, but an asteroid impact eventually led to their extinction 66 million years ago. 01:00:55 🌟 Mammals took over after the extinction of the dinosaurs, leading to the rise of human history.  Made with HARPA AI
Loved it !!
"history of the world i guess"
I can't believe I watched all of this...
Unfortunately for me it’s a bit more complicated than you
This video is going to have so many views
This makes me really think about just how impressive the accomplishments of humanity are. We’ve done so much in such a relatively short amount of time. If we survive, in a billion years we could have technology beyond comprehension.
the first 3 minutes we have rings
Esse cameraman é muito bom
"Also, the first fungi-like organisms extend their tubular arms and do fungi things."  This had me picturing fungi hanging in the club waving their arms in the air like they just don't care.  :D
After less than 8 hours it already has 800,000 views
No one is mentioning the music. Fabulous gym playlist.
Thank you
Please release a version without the narration.  Just finished watching the whole thing, and learned some things.  But now I want a chill background music to play on my office TV while I work.
Thank you guys for this astonishing video, the long road to have us enjoying around this marvelous planet, no words to describe earth and life development. Thanks for your efforts sharing science to people
Wifi Lore
The greatest concept for a time-lapse I've seen in nearly 5 billion years.... 🤘😝🤯
Good Music and good science, win-win
Life is the most beautiful thing, and time is a b***h.
Rip dinos
Y'all should release this as a live wallpaper. I don't know how you would but it would be killer
dammit i blinked and missed humanity, going to have to watch it again
geez the paleogene lookin rough
The fact that u have to wait more than 5/6 of the video to see the resemblance of large life is bewildering, really puts things into perspective
That one bacteria that took 2 million years to cross the screen.
Builnhhbb
People say we live on Earth.  No, we are Earth.
wow this is a lot
music is a bit loud to have this play in the background relative to the voice lines specificly. Otherwise great vid.
I love how mankind was only there for a split second. Makes you truly appreciate evolution over time and also know that if one thing is certain, mass extinctions always do happen and mankind has only just got started so in the future unless we don't colonize we may just as well go extincted.
Bill Wurtz did it in 19 minutes
Amazing. I think maybe they could have animated some prominent events such as mass extinctions or asteoids, etc. Great video either way.
I wanna give a shout out specifically to the AUDIO CREW: specifically Thomas Veith and Flabian Glaser!!! I see a bunch of people praising the animation crew, and they totally deserve it, but OMG! The full 1+ hour of music and sound design that flowed so naturally and felt so progressively fitting for each time period…astounding! As a music producer and someone who loves sound design (and studied film in uni), I very much appreciate how much work went into what y’all did AND how important your work was to the editing process that gave us this wonderful work of art!  Seriously, the music evolved and was seriously engaging for me as you ultimately shifted tempo, played with genres, played with time signatures, had so many variations on a theme that were constantly fresh, and built climax after climax but still only incrementally building those climaxes over an hour… Well done. Very well done.  (Audio crews rare get the recognition they deserve on film/animation projects, yet they are SO fundamental to the art, so I just had to focus on them)
mannn this is stuff of dreams a 1 hr kurgesagt video that i can use as bg to my sleep
Would there really be any volcanoes during the Hadean as shown in the video. Wouldn't all the rock be too liquid to become a volcano?
Great
Wow - def thought this was gonna be a compilation of previous videos.  You guys rock!!
I have a very strong sense that this video is gonna be one of the top100 most viewed video on YouTube, and will be played in many classes!
I was literally just now watching "history of the entire world i guess" again and I saw this in my recommendations after. Never clicked faster.
Next we need the whole universe in 2.5 hours
Omg, human history was like a blink of an eye. Truly Iconic. This is so good ✨, I'll probably come back here and watch this during my studies.
The diagonal clouds look like a mistake? 42 min in!
We are like 0.000001% of earth event yet in the little time we existed so far we got all the time to find out all of this and to let people learn about it , talk about efficiency🔥
amazing content
Name an artist that could do a better soundtrack. We know there isn't better video.
This video is a MASTERPIECE
Guys just casually dropped an hour long video
Wow just wow!
from the moment i noticed the slightest cooling on the surface of the earth to the moment it was over, i was thoroughly impressed
Thank you so much for this amazing journey. It made me feel small, in a good way.
An absolute marvel of a video. Beautifully animated and an incredible story. Thank you!
Now make it actually 4 billion years long.
I'm gonna have to watch this again in the future
Why do we live, why do we die? We are nothing but a fever to this planet.
This is a game changer in terms of visualizing deep time. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
The fact that every passing second is a million years, is something my mind can not grasp or process.
just watched this with my son, he absolutely loved it. thank you
Hi
been absolutely hitting that biology and all that stuff all my life and i just had to sit there and watch this in full. and i wouldve watched it in longer too.
I fell asleep while watching this video. Still a banger
I need someone to mix early Mesoarchean Era with "the sun is a deadly lazer" from history of the entire world pls n thank u
Oh heeeeel ya Kurzgesagt. Great workout tunes. Now do one about ants 🐜
GLITCH GLTICH IN VIDEO 29:40-29:50💀
This was truly a beautiful watch.. well, mostly listen to. Fantastic work!
In the Eoarchean phase, how did that first rain happen? Where did all that water come from?
This was very unique and breathtaking since 4.5 billion year before!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
59:05 all real ark players hate this animal
Hadean lofi beats when?
Thank you so much for enabling me to procrastinate my work due this weekend by spending 4.5 billion years watching this video!
And wherein Kurzgesagt discovered that TOOL was also born in the mesoarchean era. Not surprised.
45:00 LETS GOOOOO
Very enjoyable and informative. I expected the last second to show a stone age to space age transition, though.
sitting thru it and then getting less than a second of human era. damn.
Truly, a MASTERPIECE!
One of the greatest works of art I have ever experienced, thank you for creating this. It is spectacular.
I mean
Super awesome.
THIS IS SO AWESOME!!!
Kurzgesagt's motto is now inaccurate, they are now "Quantity, Quality, all at once."
I camed for the video, I stayed for the music
I love you guys
I think this is the sloppiest Kurzgesagt video ever even if it’s an hour long. Same animation runs in silence and there were soooo much to talk about about those eras. (I love this channel btw)
big thanks to kurzgesagt for making this vide FOR FREE
Gotta watch this at 2x.
History of the entire world I guess: extended version
Amazing video as always! 😊
The music though 🕺💃
Bill Wurtz did this in 20minutes. Get with the times.
I don't think anyone else has ever done such a good job of putting geological time into perspective.
what is that thing on the background 9:49
How just how kurzgesagt you absolute mad lads
What an amazing concept for a video and so well executed!
53:33  🎶"It's the Cambrian explosion!"🎶
Leaving this comment to a) note how amazing this was and b) feed the algorithm so more people find it.
Commenting for the algorithm.
btw the music is so dope
Now do all of human history
“Life uhh find a way”
20 years ago, solid.  Now? There is more. There is better. For example, emphasize the "visibility" part of the Cambrian Explosion: all the diversification happened before, but now "shells" become a thing so we can "see" in the fossil record.
Excellent. I really enjoyed watching this.
45:02 dub
I watched the video from start to finish, "more or less": I found that pre-Ediacaran, the length of the epochs was suitable to reading the Wikipedia article about it, maybe a followup or two,  while keeping the video open in a second window.
This is one rare masterpiece of hour long material that is likely rarely matched if at all throughout the dumpster fire at large that YouTube is now these days.  Great job and to another decade.
A few billion years is a few days for God, this is amazing.
Ok, enough time watching videos
The History of Everything video: Finally a worthy challenger!
This music is seriously so good. Is there a way to get a playlist?
wow, that was amazing! good job guys!!
Is it just me or does anyone else get nostalgic and a little sad about the life that you have missed like living with the dinosaurs and throughout of of the history of life
Very nice video,   helpful in putting things in perspective. Thanks for your effort.
This is seriously a master piece
Gave me old PC game vibes from the 80s and 90s... sounded like the music was playing on a Roland MT-32
E a trilha sonora é perfeita! Meu Deus, obrigado por vcs existirem!
i like that this is an hour long
Extra Kurzgesagt Nice 🌍
Ngl the music in this is amazing
This would make for a great animated wallpaper/lock screen etc.
An absolute masterpiece.  Not even an Emmy award could do you guys justice!!
Wait wait wait! I thought this would be some kind of complation?! Damnguys, u outdid urselves! 😲
This is a movie! just straight up.
Masterpiece
Complex life as we know it, life like us, may be so infinitesimally rare... that it may only exist once in this universe.  And it took 4.5 billion years for life to get to a point where it could make a video like this, and other life could look at that video, and understand it.  The miracle isn't that life exists.  It's that life made it to where WE are.  WE are an endangered species... and we do no respect our own scarcity... or our own fragility, especially when we know we cannot always continue to exist as we do now.  We have a limited window with which to even experience this existence, unless we learn to reach further than the limits of our biology.  We must stop fighting ourselves, if we are to ever survive the coming storm.
26:00 it sounds like stereo madness???
The educational posters would be even cooler if they werent only in english! :D
Wow, that was a wonderful experience to watch. I never quite realized how incredibly long early periods were. And as usual, Epic Mountain made some truly inspiring stuff. Hopefully I can be as good as they are someday!  Amazing work as always!
Really well done. Unique idea, only pulled off because of brilliant visuals and music. Bravo!
Never thought to hear some sick ass techno mix through this channel❤
Very very good video! I really enjoyed watching it
Imagine all the secrets that will remain untold and unseen forever to us. Makes you think, what will the future humans think of us? What will remain of today in a century? A decade? Tomorrow? As time marches on so do we but unlike time, we are changing. All of this and yet here we are today, on the dawn of a new era, whether that era is one of fire, ice or prosperity lies upon us now. Do what you can with what you are and what you have to do the most, it will make a difference on this timeline. You and what you do matters, make every year count, we only get a single molecule on a blade of grass in a field of millions of grass-blades.
million years, million years, millions years, over and over to myself watching that number go down. Thats just too much time man
We don't deserve Kurzgesagt
🔥🔥
damn… you could’ve just said 4.5 x 10 to the power of 9
Bill Wurtz somewhere: Finally! A worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!!
What an absolute masterpiece
Don't know about y'all, but I'll be shiny hunting to this. good stuff!
Thank you for this video, I have a test coming up about the past 4.5 billions of years in an hour!
The History of the entire World I guess, but its to scale.
Mitochondria not being mentioned was also a mistake
I like to think different elemental species lived in each era  0:51 Hadean  The Demons: A species of scaly humanoids with black eyes with irises that glow like lava. They could swim to lava and would watch the stars and the moon go by.   Status: Frozen in cooled lava  18:09 Late Paleoarchean-Mesoarchean  The Geotome: Large, lurking stone golems. They’re not really made out of stone, it's just a shell to cover the veins of ancient life that control and live in it. They were friendly and liked to play in the water (even though they would sink into the sea).  Status: Turned to stone
Im going to watch this video 39,420,000,000,000 times to get the full 4.5 billion year experience
At 29:43 the screen glitches a bit, is anyone else getting this?
I want that hour of my life back, felt lazy compared to your usual efforts.
Man, the production value has gone through the roof
This video is absolutely legendary
I can’t stress enough how amazing this video is. Easily putting it on the top as the best one you have done so far. Brilliant
This video is gonna reach over 100M views i can feel it, this is the epitome of Kurzgesagt animation.
This could make a fun survival video game, guiding an alien observation outpost or colony through all the ages/phases of Earth's evolution, having to adapt your strategy / technology in each unique phase while slowly growing the size of your colony. Amazing video regardless!!! : )
😮
Definitely getting something from the shop for all this effort
jesus christ, the statherian is boring! oh nvm its nighttime now 👀
I have been looking forward to this. The family and I are watching this one tonight for movie time. Let's goooooo
really cool and educational! could we have a version with just the instrumental and visuals too? it'd be quite the nice ambient video to have in the background 💕
Epic! In so many ways.
Kurzgesagt: the not so in a nutshell movie.
What is your first ever video
This is one of the best videos on YouTube In my oppinion. It really feels like you are experiencing the whole damn timeline, but the video is only 1 hour, not billions of years. WTF
Thank you for doing this
How?
This video has invention of sex, amazing.
19:20 that was a pretty badass little jam. Then at 21:20? Whaaaatt? That was some HARDCORE educational tunes!! My head was bobbin pretty hard. Sounded like a TooL intro or interlude.
The music in this video is incredible, just like every other video, I also like how you threw in 'Behind the Lies' for the end considering it is one of my favorite songs that you guys have made, keep up the good work!
Yo, who gave the mesoarchean era a djent song?
This is the most dedication I have ever seen from any channel, mad respect 🫡
No, thank YOU!
Well there went my Friday evening plans!
Amaizing video))),  Just to point out  there is a coruption on the video file on 29:43.
i NEED a backgroung engine of this
Props to the camera man
Quite amazing. Thank you.
I absolutely love this video. the soundtrack really gives this feeling of how each stage of the earths history felt. The animation is amazing thank you Kurzgesagt for 10 years of amazing (free) content!
What a incredible piece of work this is. Thank you so much for doing this!
Are we getting a 3 hour long universe video too?
Can i get a : HEEEEYAAAAAAAAAAAH?
If I had seen this in K-12 once or twice I would’ve majored in biological anthropology or something. I hope millions of kids see this and are just gripped by it and get curious.
Perfect. Something new to show in K-12 AND Sunday School 😄
On average we blink our eyes about once every four seconds. On average a species will exist for about five million years before going extinct. At this time-scale those two time-spans are about the same. The actual blink of an eye itself lasts about 0.1 to 0.15 seconds, which in this video would represent 125,000 to 187,500 years. He wasn’t kidding when he said don’t blink or you might miss all of human history. (And the current average human lifespan would be 0.056 milliseconds here) (Also there would be about 50,000 generations of humans every second)
How could the climate have changed so much so long ago? Humans weren't even around!
F E A T U R E  L E N G T H
That was extremely worth it and touching. Thank you so much. This felt so good to watch. It was relaxing most of the time, and the experience taken as a whole has provided me with some very moving meditations. I think such things are gonna stick with me.
Cryogenian - how life survived? Maybe thx internal thermal vulcanos under water.
This is now my second favourite video on the internet
when you went underwater at the end of mesoarchean was so pretty!!!
I needed this
yes, what I've been waiting for ❤❤❤
1 hour if constant music to fit perfectly with the animation and timeperiod is impressive as hell
Amazing production. Thx, M
A masterpiece!
Imma watch this on every lunch break from now on
Insane commitment on this video. Congrats for pulling it off!
Did you guys employ any AI-generative tools, like image generators or language models, in the making of this video? If so, in what ways did you guys use it? And for what purpose? And why?
This is amazing, even for you
This video was awesome; it had me absorbed for the full hour.  I did wonder why no mention of evidence of those first complex multicellulars (sponges and/or comb jellies) from the Tonian. Or maybe that theory is out or I missed something 🤷‍♂️
Who knew ads dated back to the paleoarchaean!
This is something that I’ve been looking forward to and I didn’t even know it.
Been waiting on a video like this for awhile
An hour of such intricate animation!? You guys are madlads and I love it
how did water came on the planet? it was lava, then x happens and it raned??? how
I can think of about 200 posters you can make from this!
This is amazing. Please more of this. Do all existence over 24 hours
I hope I'm not the only one who really enjoys the music part of this? Actually enjoyable and calming in a way!
Man just thinking of the rendering time for this besides the exporting. It's a gift to be able to watch it for free.
what a titanic work ! A magnificant video you achieved. And We the community are very thankful for it.
"Oh hey, a dinosaur!" Was my favorite part ❤ Great video as always!
wow, 1 hour long kurzgesagt video!
All those billions of years; just so I can sit on the toilet and write this comment.
omg wake up babe new kurzgesagt just dropped and it's ONE HOUR LONG
A 1-hour video? It must be my birthday
This is the best 4,500,000,000 years I've spent in a while. Happy 10 years birthday Kurzgesagt I hope you get a nice cake.
Me setting the video to 2x speed so i can experience 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes 😎
So, no designers left to make an actual video?
So it was pretty empty for a while lol
Bro all the way from 2019 to 2023 😮. THAT'S CRAZY
Crazy to think our planet was covered with molten lava for literally millions of years. Never really sat and thought about that.
i. love. this.
It is absolutely mind-boggling to think that civilization has only been around for 2 milliseconds out of an hour long length of time
Wonderful idea.
This is almost mesmerizing. If I could have just the soundtrack I probably would have fallen asleep already.
This is absolutely mind blowing!
Here's my new video that's constantly gonna be playing on loop while I work.
"1.2 Billion Years Ago, in the Stenian, not that much is going on... Except, the algea Bangiomorpha Pubescens might have invented sex!" YOOOOOO!!! POG
every Super Mario Bros (1985 NES) second is a million years.
The new Lo-fi girl ❤
Life uhhhh finds a way 🎉
Im at 14min but i think what is funny is that 1billion years and not much is appening but the last few minutes of the video is gonna be humans and so many things going 😳
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant. Very well done to make such a moving and unqiue to kurzgesagt experience
Your dedication to making incredibly informative and beautiful content is awe inspiring. Thank you, Kurzgesagt.
This is such an artful and informative project!
This is so awesome :D
hello there
Wow that was amazing. That must’ve been a lot of work to produce. It really put Earths history into perspective.   Some other topics I would watch in this format: The birth of our solar system, the progression of technology (slowed down), or the complete evolution from single cell to human.
Maybe
Super experiment. Super music. Great job!
Excellent work really appreciate it  Huge respect to the team behind it❤
easter egg centrall ❤
No wonder he never dies, cameraman has been here since the very beginning
It took me just less than 3 billion years to clean my kitchen with this video playing in the background. I must say, the soundtrack is immaculate. Smooth and continuous with no cuts. Thank you!
I hope you get a lot of money from the views of this video. This must have taken years to make.
Did you say confy? DID YOU SAY CONFY?
Did i just spend an entire hour watching earth's history at 1 AM?
Music's 🔥🔥
This is actually what social media needed. To see it visually year by year. Thanks.
A whole movie by Kurzgesagt! wow!
I would be devoid of any sense of appreciation if I took the efforts that made us watch this free masterpiece material for granted. Our big THANK YOUs do not suffice.
Streching unimaginable scales down to imaginable ones is always impressive. In Munich we have a 1h long solar system wall from the sun to pluto, while the earth is 1cm on size.
If I were to be ejected into the eternal void and could bring with me the content of only one YouTube channel to be immortalized for all of time as a memorial of this lonely little planet and the ancient past, I would choose this channel.  Edit: and then, if I had to choose only one video, it might just be this video. Great job kerzgesagt team!
YES! LONG VIDEO!!
This feels like something I'll watch from time to time... Just beautiful and awe inspiring. So the usual fare, but now an hour long, from Kurzgesagt!!
CUTE CARTOON
How is no one here talking about the amazing soundtrack! It matches with the gradual build-up of Earth's history very well.
You spend 45 minutes waiting for things to move and then all of the sudden, it is blink and you miss it.
this reminds of early no man's sky, where I'd settled on a paradise planet, but patch after patch the environment changed from paradise to dessert to swamp to volcanic finally landing on frozen wasteland where it has remained such to this day.
Hi, you're on a rock floating in space.
Incredible video! Thank you for this <3
I wish this had Terraria music
i like this
loved how the meteor, the explosion, the nuclear winter and the climate change after it took only a couple of frames,  that really helped solidify the whole idea for me
This deserves 4.5 billion views! Amazingly, astoundingly, inspirationally awesome work yet again :)
In the time scale of the Earth, the Earth basically blinked and some random primate took over everything. As far as the Earth is concerned, The Asteroid impact and Humanity lasted the same amount of time
This was BEAUTIFUL! Thank you for the lovely perspective. I was captivated by the whole video, even the first 45 minutes.
EXCELENTEEEEE
In the beginning god created the heavens and the DERP😅
I firmly believe this is the best channel on YouTube, it’s funny, well animated, educational and just amazing. It’s so well rounded it’s incredible. Well done, Kurzgesagt
Glitch at 29:42
We needed this.
I'd never thought id see the day a video like this was released.
Get your here within 10 hours ticket here!
You guys still never made that plate tectonics video mentioned in the other History of Earth video, I NEED IT.
I've been without electricity for the whole day but this kept me smiling and attentive for so much! Thanks the Kurzgesagt team for all of your hard work!
Que increíble trabajo, felicitaciones y gracias
Germans, couldn't expect anything worse, best video of the Chanel so far😵😵
Wow
respect to the cameraman who lived 4.5 billion years through an oxygenless atmosphere, endless rainstorms, and thousands of degrees celsius for this video

45:00 sex was invented
Imagine this but every day of ww2 in a second
So amzyng! thank you guys!!
I felt so much watching this.  From the long nothing to the "don't blink, or you'll miss it"  I love you, Kurzgesagt.   I am waiting for the next wonder you'll make.
An hour long Kurz video, am i dreaming???
The new "the history of the whole world, i guess" is here.
Can we just appreciate the animation team for making an animation an hour long?
at 58:12 life, uh, finds a way.
some parts of the video have an animation similar to that of Koranos 😮
Bill Wurtz did it first
Me just viping NARRATOR JUMPSCARE
So glad this came out this morning I could listen to it all through the school day :D
Shout out to the stenian for creating sex
so if im not wrong , out of 1 hour we lived only for 2.6 seconds ?
Kurzgesagt  Hey guys, you made it, just remember that your audience understands and appreciates your work and understanding.   -G
Just sittin' here playin' solitaire and found myself enjoyin the music during the Hadean Era. ... excuse me I'm goin back to play & watch
Nice transitions as always
Props to the cameraman who survive hell and extinction level event for billons of years just to give us this video
It's amazing how I can watch 1h video by Kurzgesagt, without previous notice, and still feel like rewatching it again... while 1min video from other channels may seem too long.
39:50 did you spit?
"I'M SIGNIFICANT...Screamed the dust speck."
To think there was a long period where you could swim in the ocean and be completely alone is terrifying
Man this should be a background for phones.  So freaking cool
Bye
تبارك الذي بيده الملك
What acool video
Time very well spent
45:00 Inventing sex. Imagine being a virgin algae lololol
DAMNNN THAT MUSIC HITS.
This was so great! Thank you.
I know that we as a species are young, but this video has greatly put into perspective HOW young we actually are. On a planetary timescale we are a true biological explosion with a nuclear impact. It's like Mother Nature and Planet Earth has been punched in the face by and swept of their feet by our existence and presence in/on it.  Somehow I feel like its only a matter of time before the next meteor hit forces Planet Earth to do a tabula rasa.
This video would make a great background for Street Fighter
1 HOUR????!!!!!!!!! damn
Yes yes yes thank you
Love the evolving soundscape ❤
I REALLY want the audio for the mesoarchean era. That music was freaking TOP NOTCH.
Yea neo-i mean ah never mind
This feels like a last ditch effort for retention time 😂😂 loved it nonetheless
Thank you so much for this beautiful masterpiece!!! 😍
Wow, thank you! This is a peace of art!
Gonna get stoned and watch this.  What an incredible time we live in man, the fact this content is free and so valuable to any age group is insane,thank you so much for the work every member of Kurzgesagt put into these videos!
1:00:39  "Don't blink or you might miss all of human history".  It's insane how small we are on this planet. Just as short as a blink
You would need a 60 fps video just to have the last 3000 years on one single frame
I loved it ! I learned so much about the history of our planet ! I'm still in awe about how old it is and how long it took for multi-cellular life to come around. Thank you so much to Epic Mountain for the great music too ! :D
Life uhh finds a way:-)
I love this channel so much ❤
The video is great, BUT THIS SOUNDTRACK IS FUCKING FIRE LFG
What's the ideal animated show to enjoy while on the treadmill?
An expetional hour spent watching history. Happy 10nth anniversary!
As a guy who don't like history ... this is amazing !
42:24 Yup
1 hour of happines
What a GREAT video!SO COOLLLL!😍
When im high its such a great experience to watch those videos!
The art: incredible  The music: perfect The concept: amazing Being released for free: unbelievable
Kurzgesagt videos feel like another world one screen away
Permian wait did you just say thanks volcanos
Try 6000 years of underwater!😂🎉❤
TOO BEAUTIFUL😭😭😭😭😭😭
De- i mean carboniferous age is so cool
Best video ever!
now i kinda want a version without narration
Algorithm Comment.  Amazing.
Kurzgesagt:The Begging Of Life in Earth Movie
This is so ******* cool.
holy smokes, i started this thinking it was the normal length and then realized i better make a coffee before watching.  so excited.
Very humbling to put our existence into perspective; that it is not even a blink of an eye and insignificant outside of our species and time here. This actually gives me a greater appreciation for the moment that we have.❤
Wait, correct me if i'm wrong but, didn't the oceans turned red at a point ? Because of suspended iron in the water oxydazing due to the creation of oxygen by cyanobacteria ?
39:54 Why he spitting on us?
We all know how amazing this entire video is, but I especially love the dynamic soundtrack in the back.
vibing at 1.25x
Some of that music was like terraria music hahaha love it
Cool vid
It's like a Berghain night with Geological Eras. I loved it
This is a good video
Thank you
The music in that video is SO GOOD. Very progy! Is there any way to get the music alone? Masive congratulation to Thomas and Fabian. The whole concept was executed with brilliance. Bravo to the team!
I love the Tool like music.
The music and the visuals in this were actually wonderful to have in the background while I was working. This video is a straight banger.
714,045 views
I blinked on that last part, now i have to watch it all over again.
0:13 I'll do you one better: "You're aboard the Magic School Bus"... =)
If today I am a curious person who loves studying and consuming science, it was thanks to the magnificent work you guys have done over the last 10 years. The quality and commitment of your videos and products are beyond incredible and deserves worldwide recognition. I hope your work continues to inspires and amuse as many people as possible. Much love from Brazil  ❤
damn the music in this video is so good tho.. i need a playlist of this edit: i learnt to read the description
You guys keep out doing yourselves each time amazingly well done🎉🎉
57:21 Long ago, before dinosaurs appeared, the world experienced the greatest extinction of living organisms in the history of life on our planet. On Earth, the Permian extinction occurred, 90% of animal and plant species left our family tree forever, but a lucky few managed to survive them. One of them was a small herbivore about the size of a domestic pig, a therapsid. Its name was Lystrosaurus. He ruled the supercontinent Pangea for nearly 4 MILLION YEARS. After the Permian extinction, it had no more natural enemies for the next few million years... It lived a crisp and peaceful life in the wastelands of Pangaea. It conquered all lands and at one point 80% of all land vertebrates were of its genus. No genre before or since has achieved such success... However, one day an evil Gorgonops appeared, a powerful prehistoric lizard weighing 1 ton and 3 meters long. He became the doom of the Lystrosaurus. After millions of years of idyllic life, Lystrosaurus lost its survival instinct. Lystrosaurs became the Dodo birds of their day. It simply disappeared from the surface of the Blue Planet, but 1/4 of a billion years later a certain species of primate (that's what I'm writing about us) found its fossils forgotten in prehistory... what am I getting at? Everyone has lived and everyone will cease to live forever. But that doesn't mean it won't cease to exist. Man ceases to live forever, but as long as he is remembered, he still EXISTS.
Had to pause a few times so got to experience the scale for ~11 Billion years 10/10
I liked the concept but there were some major misses.   There could have been more asteroid impact animations because one was mentioned only in the narration.   The dinosaurs were all shown without any feathers which goes against a few previous videos.
THE TACK FUCKING SLAPS BRO
I don't know how to fully describe it, but there's always this feeling of pure wonder like: "I cannot believe THIS is our world, and this is our universe" that I get each time I watch one of Kurzgegagts videos
❤🥹
My favorite part was the human update
I gotta say, Kurzgesagt doesnt dissapoint. The amount of hours that were spent making this video, on top of the very nice music is so cool
filminho da Kurgesagt? tô dentro kjrk
I noticed the miusic wow
you can hear the influences of the terraria soundtrack in the music, i love it
Its incredible if you think that in a human lifetime in the timescale of the video, light can travel only 16km!
CAN WE JUST EKNOWLEDGE THE AMAZING SOUND DESIGN? these tracks enhanced this experience to a 100000000
4.5 billion years in 1 hour - each second represents 1.25 million years, which means the entire human history was a split second at the end of the video. So let's take the last second and repeat the process. In the NEW 1 hour video each second represents roughly 350 years. Therefore the entire human history, or the last 10,000 years, will still be just half a minute at the end.
whats going on at 20:18. there is a shadow that appears and vanishes super quickly on the rock on the bottom of the screen.
Kurzgesagt always makes me feel something.  😂 oddly, and probably less existential crisis-y than most. ❤
algorythm
So cool to see what this little globe has gone through, makes me reflect a lot.. No matter how many times life has been killed off, it kept coming back.. Its quite wild!  We as a species, has so much more to learn about this little world and this ginormours universe.  If we dont end up killing ourself, the future is so exciting!  I hope we make it 🥲 Thanks Kurzgesagt 🤩
i just pissed on my wall
The Mesoarchean soundtrack has some real Kelly Bailey/Half-Life vibes. Love it!
This was amazing! ❤
Damn this is absolutely gorgeous thank you. The music is perfect (psytrance fans will enjoy)
You knowwhats crazy tho.   The vast majority of this is based off a theory
Christmas must have came early
:) yay
Your still pronating the wrists of your dinosaurs, guys.
The floor is lava
Sell this as an animated wallpaper xD
If I ever travel back in time to the Hadean period, I'll name this planet Mustafar. 😹
👏
This was a great wallpaper for my desktops computer
A 1 hour video that explores the space and time of Earth, to put on in the background, while we travel through time and space on Earth...... *owen wilson wow*
Happy 10th Kurzgesagt! This made me feel that our planet, and us ourselves are pretty magical. And we got to show up for the interesting bits!
yea so like can we stop helping things go extinct so all those cells didn't waste their time trying to make cool stuff for like 2 billion years?
God created all of this.
A whole hour of kurzgesagt in less than a month??? You guys are crazy (but also awesome)
It was deffinately interresting to see everything that happened in relation to time, maybe saying a few more things would be good like each time a new arra beginns and when cells merged (I kinda missed that) and adding a few more progessiv annimations like in the first two with the lava moon and the water, but they were generally great, congrets on 10 Years Kurzgesagt, great Video
even tho i love kurzgesagt i never expected this much, my respect for them has gone miles up
Just incredible work as always ❤
Amazing video
🔥🔥🔥
Keep in mind that in this scale the Universe existed for another two hours before earth even came to be, and still Mankind's entire history is just a fraction of a second at the end of this journey.
Thats exactly what me and my new bong needed
Amazing! It would have been great a box with the average temperature on earth in each second/million year. It would have been nice to see how the “life conditions” would evolve from that horrific hell situation that was 4.5 billion years ago. Anyway, great job! ❤
Amazing work! I knew from before that the time gap between first life forming, evolution of multicellular life and everything else was huge, but this video really puts it in a whole new perspective! Also, I giggled at the end because the whole video I was thinking about how you'd present the tiny blip of human existence in contrast to everything else 😂
Loved this. I kind of knew the general picture of the history of earth. Though I tend to focus on the part with life in it (I am a biologist) so it was great to see the early geologic parts I usually skip over. I remember a certain section being called "the boring billion". I totally get it now! One criticism, sort of, I kind of wish youd given the name of more of the features, like the crater or the natural nuclear reactor. Of course that would have sent me down the google rabbithole so maybe that was intentional. Enjoyed it regardless, thank you.
Where do I purchase my "I've witnessed the history of the Earth" - kurzgesagt T-Shirt? 😊
I saw the views chang 39s ago
This reminds of that video MelodySheep published years ago about timelaps of the entire universe. Really cool stuff
Holy crap. I saw the initial hour length and thought "Oh no. Kurzgesagt has gone the route of doing a compilation of their old videos". Nope. A full hour of earth evolving.
I was the 100k like
The fluidity of the animation progressing as things evolve is beautiful and I can see why it took so long to work on. Beautifully done and does an excellent job of putting the timescale of Earth into perspective
45:03 I can list a few
I got high and watched this for two hours
Half expected to see Rincewind just hanging around for the whole video, peeking at a history of Roundworld.
😅 trash, purely looped "animation", didn't show any of the events announced, comet impact 2.05 billions years ago? Kept showing just the looped desert background, nothing else, this music is super hype for a slow animation. I just lost 1 hour of my life.
The music 20:18
So many things happen in each of these periods, that I think the time in silence could have been better used to explain many more things. I suggest that the channel makes a new version with more explanations throughout the video. By the way, I love the channel and I hope it becomes even more successful.
I did felt !
The only thing I felt during this was existential dread wondering where exactly the alleged metaphysical manifestation of God from deep antiquity fits into all of it…
YouTube added 5 million years of advertisements :D
I legit just sat and watched the entire thing right now  Earbuds in, bobbing my head to the music, eyes on the screen for an hour  And I loved it!  Something about the long format is so good at conveying the scale of time we're talking about  I FEALT it when I was 57 minutes into a 1 hour video, and only then did the dinosaurs arrive.  Absolutely wonderful video
I watched this at 0.25x speed to understand 4.6 billion years 4 times better than if i watched it normally. Thanks Kurzgesagt :)
The history of the world I guess the remake
the one hour long video I am willing to watch
Thanks for the video
@kurzgesagt what was the piano music at the very end of the video? Thanks :)
Where did the water of the Eoarchean come from?
“Life, uh… finds a way.” -Dr. Ian Malcolm, 1993 58:12
29:43 uhhhhhhhh
To see infinity in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower To hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour
AN HOUR LONG? Incredible!
Great video. Thank you. In my opinion, it would have been even better if a lot more human events flashed in the end to show how tiny of our history in the timeline of Earth's history.
Know how bees go and polonize? Perhaps we are the universe's final product: The bees. Took us long enough,!
I dont feel like i truly deserve this for free..
E
This is like one one of those unnerving images that you can’t take your eyes off. Massive props kurz! ❤❤❤
A one hour long Kurzgesagt video. Weekend plans cancelled.
The drum beat and bass during the Ectasian grooooves
this is a good idea for a video
It was a great ride! Thanks!
This is such an interesting video. To think that every second is so many years, and that it totals up to an hour long is just insane.
Was that a Homo Erectus at the end there?  It's hard to tell in the style...
Kurzgesagt's animators surpassed themselves
Amazing
Amazing! Please do a calendar for next year! I collected the calendar for the last 4 years, would be amazing to see monthly timeline with the visuals like this ❤
now we need secod part of this movie. 1hour for Quaternary :)
Omg what an amazing video ❤️
Ay Kurzgesagt I found an animation error if you want me to say where it is
I started jumping when I seen a one hour video I love watching ur vids before sleep😭
1 hour of high quality animation, absolutely amazing!
Posting this comment shortly after the billion year mark, and I'm thinking to myself as I'm watching this, fully intending to watch this with my undivided attention all the way through, that if the dinosaurs lasted 165 million years that ended around 65-66 million years ago, I'm not going to see much of classic "dinosaur" imagery until the last 5 or 6 minutes or so of this whole hour+ long transitional video, and the dinosaurs themselves will last just under 3 minutes before the earth returns to being in a hellscape for a short time, and that humans will only be in the very last second. All of humans. All of human history condensed down to a singular second to put into perspective how long the rest of earth's history truly is.  This is a marvel of a video already, and I can't wait to witness the rest of it. I couldn't imagine how much effort this video would take to make, and Kurzgesagt has much my gratitude and wonderment as I realize that not only was this kind of video extremely ambitious, but it also must have been more than incredibly fun and fascinating to make, or it might not exist, and it makes me feel wonderfully understood that I can imagine myself relating to people I don't know over the fact the we have common interests so powerful that it drives their daily creativity and work flow even.
Oh my, this soundtrack is gold. I might need to commission your musicians haha!
I thought it was a movie
outstanding. really enjoying the synth work with the animations. thank you guys!
Boring and dumb!!! Kurzesagt should have added aliens and cooler stuff. This was the mostes boring thing I've ever watched. I'm unsubscribing!
Fuck yeah 👏
I would love it with just the soundtrack for study and chill <3
Knowing kurzgesagt makes videos ranging form 5-15 minutes makes this incredible, not to mention they've been working on their vr game for who knows long. It was announced just a few months ago but was probably in the works for longer. I've been watching kurzgesagt for probably 3 years and I still am, the channel has changed for the better a lot from quality and how long videos are. I truly hope kuezgesagt becomes bigger in the future. Ever since I first started watching them I've been interested in astronomy and biology. I thank them for making videos, if they hadn't I probably wouldn't have been as smart as I am now. Keep in mind I'm only 12 years old.
This whole eons are basically enough time for my bae's party makeup
7 hours posted, and I'm watching for the second time... I'm addicted to that music!
Cómo quisiera que traduscan a español
siderian has a soundtrack terraria wishes it had
I'm trying to have an existential crisis not bust a move
Uiop0ol i saw your comment in 21s
Beautiful :)
Once again, kurzgestaght proving why they are my favorite creators on YouTube
Just to further blow minds: Homo Sapiens have only been here 0.2 seconds at this scale!
The Earth is *old.* Most people don't realize how old. Currently, the Earth is estimated to be around one third the age of the Universe. That's like if you have a child when you're 20, they're already 10 years old by the time you're only 30.
I love that the music syncs with the background every time🤩
I listened to all of it and i loved it 🥰
This is so beautiful
anyone else just jamming out to the music and reading comments?
1st beat drop at 3:48
This is one of the coolest things you’ve done, and you’ve done a LOT of cool things.
Major mass extinctions event 27:48 Oxygenation mass extinctionevent 53:57 59:50
This certainly wasn't what I expected to be doing with a Friday evening, but here we are...I am thoroughly enjoying a properly scaled timeline of Earth's history. The animation and score are beautiful, so the early times with very little happening and information available are actually still quite beautiful. This is extremely impressive and incredibly fascinating!
That video belongs in a place like Our Dynamic Earth with moving dioramas and actors as a tourist attraction. The animation is gorgeous and it puts life into perspective with just how long the earth's history is especially since only the last what 8 minutes had any sort of complex life in it. And for the most part that life was in the oceans. It's also really telling that  that the closer we got to humans the more we know about what happened. And we still don't even have the full story because literally all of it is done in hindsight.
Amazing! Great work everyone at kurzgesagt!
“In the beginning, god created the heavens and the earth”
This whole thing would make an amazing background for a computer
Probably one of the best videos!
Proprably becuase of us
This surely is a great project, the people who worked on this should feel very proud of themselves. Not just the animation, the music too! Same can be said for every Kurzgesagt video.
Not kurz.
The ages get thiner and thiner the more you watch the video
I need this as a wallpaper for my computer Rn. Amazing work
welp, I just found a new video to play in the background while I study
A detail I loved, that carried the whole video in my eyes, is the MUSIC!!!  I was BOPPING the whole way! Great work kursgesagt!
Amazing that Earth did its best Mustafar impression for half a billion years.
Hopefully im not the only one wondering here, but the natural nuclear fission reaction is estimated to have lasted for a couple hundred-thousand years and produced and averaging about 100kW over that time
Pretty boring. Don't understand why there's no voice over for the wholr video. There was so much to explain
Yes I have another super long video to just have on a loop.
best 1 hour of my life
This took a while but you did it ❤❤
I didn't know that mc Donald's was founded 3.5 billion years ago. Cool. ( Ad)
"Don't blink, or you might miss all human history:" out of a video of 1h, is incredible to see in perspective how life is recent and how many mass extinctions happened. Now I can go out and don't give a damn about traffic!
This really helps with my attention span
me: in just gonna skip all until prehistory and first civilizations. *goes to the end.
The fact that we have a power to skip time for almost 10 million years was awesome..
I need to find a way to make this video a dynamic wallpaper
did'nt the bible said that earth is 6000 years old?
Earth is weird It’s a rock planet that became a ice planet and also a planet that can hold life
Some of the songs in this video are giving me Shpongle vibes, I wonder if the artist takes inspiration from them.
What the frick, I've been waiting for a video but I got a whole documentary
8:30 average british weather xD
Makes me want to play Spore again XD
not up to par
i needed this
Beautiful, I'm glad that's not how it happened though. Nothing can't come from nothing...
what a ride!
watched the entire thing.  Good stuff.
the music in this video for me makes even better and its importance is underrated, what an amazing animation work!
The Mesoarchean soundtrack felt like if DOOM's and Stellaris' soundtracks had a baby. Nice work there!
Not narrated by blll wurtz. Doesn’t count,
ah yes, asteroids fallin onto earth for 3 million years (no rant, its immensely cool, just found this pretty funny)
i love your stuff. keep up the good work. just wished you had better music in the background to listen to.
Only ten minutes in, and its amazing
this is better than that split screen thing with a gameplay below to catch my attention XD
Amazing. I love this idea. You guys are so creative!
this is in fact, not in a nut shell
Dawg no way I waited 53 minutes just for something to move💀💀💀💀
I live dinosaurs so much, it made me cry when the asteroid hit😢
Holy shit what a cataclysmic video.  I love you guys.  To animate all of this.  What a special channel.  May you inspire our future for generations to come. Even when this form of media becomes antiquated.  What a crazy thing to think.  Here’s to the future from 2023.
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE CRETACEAN WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥
32:27 i feel like this is what mars looked like a long time ago
Beautiful transition between the ages of our world history 😊
Y is the asteroid that killed the dino's such a bummer?   Without it we would Not exist.
Well, probably they will start whit genesis chapter 1.  1 hour later: Well, it was a really good prequel of genesis
For anyone wondering, time is sped up 47.304.000.000.000 x
Damn, this is, beside everything else a damn good Techno set, thank you!
Siderian and no mention of iron? :(
Amazing amazing work
I regularly watch Dr. Christopher White's set of videos covering the entirety of geologic time; this is an amazingly entertaining and brilliantly compact "summary" of the same story. This video will be blowing away human minds for many years to come. Well done.
I'm not liking that this doesn't have much narration. 😢
STRAP IN, NERDS
Great great work. Finally we have a real tool to improve our perception on time at planet scale. There can be movie theatre events, organized casually. Great work.
what a video, magnificent !
45:00 big fan
Thank you bangiomorpha pubescens
Simply beautiful.  So well done.  Thank you.
Everything about this is perfect and beautiful. Thank you. Really thank you.
I'm not sure whether "But still, life is only cells." means, "At this point (1.6mya) life still only consists of unicellular organisms." or, "Nonetheless, life only consists of cells, so this is still important." (or both!)
When I have 1 hour before the history exam and I forget what time period it’s on
Right at the climax of "don't blink", after watching for an hour to see the arrival of humans, the video cut to an Amazon advertisement. It completely ruined the experience. EDIT: I deleted some harsh words in my reaction to the abrupt Amazon advertisement, the video itself does not deserve it, it was otherwise beautiful. Thanks.
literally a movie I love you kurzgesagt
You've been working on this since 2019??? You are legends! What a ride!
This is fantastic when I'm doing homework. The visual, the music, and animations are the vibes. ❤
This video is great, and incredible. A hope the video can get a lot of subcribers and likes
Beautiful. Fantastic! And as usual: the music! Absolutely stunning.  The Theia-Moon-Thing was wonderfully visualised (like everything else, of course)
I didn't like my comment but I liked the video
my gawd i didnt even notice that the video was 1 hour long! Good job!
Fantastic
👏👏👏Respect
The Views were changing when i was watching
wow this is really a masterpiece. this film goes beyond youtube
Never thought of watching an hour long video  and was happy. Felt like riding a train through the past. Anyways, happy 10th anniversary! Watching you since young.
I need... I want a 10 hour video of the Hadean era with the chillin' music
Congrats on 10 years!!! Just some constructive criticism:  I did not like scrolling through this video to find the parts where you spoke. Either some kind of indicator to know when the next informational talk was going to come in, or to have more varied visuals so that it is not a chore to watch the same area go by. I noticed that some of the dialogue coincides with the era changing so I could use the timestamps to find the next informational dialogue, but there were multiple dialogue sections that I may have missed by skipping over the looping visuals.  I did not see much value in making it a 1 hr video to showcase the relative difference in the time of each era. Personally I would have appreciated this video being presented in the usual way rather than me having to scroll through the video trying to find the next dialogue bit.
I thoroughly enjoyed this, please do something like this again
The mesoarchean period sounds proggy as hell.
And yet, it is still younger than ur mom
history of the entire world, I guess
♥
kurzgesagt
Fun fact: Newer research seems to suggest that life on Earth is slightly older than we thought. Meaning that the Hadean Era might have ended earlier than we thought and that liquid water oceans formed much earlier as a result. More research is needed to say anything definitive.  Edit: Yes. The video states this possibility too. Zircons might be the key to understanding the emergence of life.
Bravo, c'était fantastique. merci beaucoup
And Andy is floating somewhere around all the time
Guy's I don't have words to explain how amazing are your videos.
The idea of this video in itself is oddly spot-on. 👍👏
This is the first 1-hour video I have ever sat through without doing anything else. Truly glorious.
Oh what a dangeras Mesoarchean age <=J.
Incredible relaxing and informative.
As an electronic music lover this is ridiculous❤
It's so interesting seeing your artstyle change throughout the length of this video
I'm so incredibly moist
I hate that i couldn't like this video a second time. Such an awesome video ❤❤❤
No time for 1h of wild guessing, flimsy deductions and crazy theories
I absolity love this chanel i watched every video at least 2 times
قبل المشاهدة، شكرا على المجهود، لن تضيع مجهوداتكم سدىً.
There is just something profound about really understanding for how short a time life as we know it has existed, and how extremely short by comparison even to that the entirety of human history, achievement and sorrow has been. Blink and you'll miss it indeed - and blink again, and we might be long gone.
i love how i just straight up watched an hour of animated timelapse
Love your video and content as always guys! You are amazing 🙌🏻💯✨🫶🏻❤️
I fully expected this to start with "youre on a rock floating in space" lol
This entire track sounds amazing!!
Amazing!!!! 😂 billion of years seem long even on that scale 🙈
coincidentally I just got a fresh bag today. life just keeps lemoning lemons on my face
This would be so good as a animated wall paper on wall paper engine
Just Wow, its amazing
I can fall asleep to the narrators voice. So soothing.
What the.... Kurzgesagt, its November you cant go giving out gifts this early!
This is epic! Would love to see a history of humanity vid. Though that's quite a lot to cover.
I just started this video and and I already know it will be one of the best, but more likely THE best, 1 hour long videos on youtube for years to come. Keep up the amazing work you do and when I get a solid paying job I promise to start donating to support your work, which I profusely enjoy. Thank you so much for doing what you do to EVERYONE who makes this channel possible <3.
Hold on!!  You said Fungi?  Kinda sus about those space traveling spore's theory.

You know it's not that suppriseing but amazing. I never knew about this... thank you
This is actually amazing from much different standpoints, great job!
I am now officially 4 billion years old.
Glitch at 29:43
6:49 it fidnt actually take a remnant of theia millions of years to fall to earth did it? The metor falling animation is on a different time scale?

Thank you, this is relaxing, very cool, very intriguing and just amazing.
Kurzgesagt really challenge our attention span lol
You should make this episode opensource with a reasonable GPL in order to allow others to zoom in and magnify events of ages. I humbly suggest.
The sequel to the history of the entire world I guess lol
a 1 hournutshell video??????? yes please
wow. it’s soooooo coool
Animated Desktop Backgrounds soon? 🥹
I really enjoyed this Langgesagt episode.
Couldn’t imagine how massive this project is! Thanks Kurzgesact!
i had anxiety today for the first time in a while an this video heloped me focus and breathe, thank you 💚
6h
There's a glitch in the foreground texture on 29:44
Fun Fact: That is also how much time was put into making this video.
Astonishing video! I couldn't get my eyes off ❤
Awesome video, can’t find one like it anywhere I’m going to donate just because of this!!
Chill journey, I'd recommend to just litterally space out on this video 😎
I cannot not be impressed by the fact that from this entire hour of video,  only about 2 seconds represents the whole history of humanity 💀

Getting high for this one
10:42 the last meteorites ☄
Insane that humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, which feels like a long time, but is a mere blink compared to the universe. And our modern society is only a blink of a blink
What an awesome pre-earth soundtrack. Bravo!
I knew buying a calendar every year was worth it. The best group of people.
Now some procedural/AI animation techniques to make an Earth history video that lasts actual 4.5 billion years for die-hard fans.
Kurzgesagt never fails to amaze me with their ability to make complex topics like Earth's history so accessible and visually captivating. Learning about our planet's incredible journey in such a concise yet comprehensive way is truly a treat. Hats off to the Kurzgesagt team for another fantastic video!
_To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour_ - William Blake
Wow this video is amazing
❤
Wow ❤
The end at 1:00:38 is a good lesson for making us more humble and less destructive. We really are young brats :/
I watched this almost half straight
Futurama did this once too
KURZGESAGT I LOVE YOU
Definitely avoid Carboniferous if you hate bugs
Awesome.
6670 comments so far so not much chance anyone sees this one. Please read this to the end. It could save your life. First, as a biochemist I can assure you there isn't a shred of scientific evidence for this video. Second, the world is about to enter into the Tribulation. The first sure sign of it is that half the Christians disappear (likely Oct 2025) (the official story will be the aliens took them, after months of signs of aliens). There will be much chaos at this point, naturally, but the antichrist world leader, Arabian, will exude confidence and the world will put their trust in him. Bibles will be confiscated and cities will be fenced off. The Jews will be allowed to make sacrifices. For 3 and a half years the troubles will only be bad. There will be a plague that kills as bad as the Black Death. People will be forced to have a chip implant on their wrist or forehead. Christians will be beheaded for refusing. Then the next 3 and half years will be very bad. Many will die. Two witnesses for God will be unkillable, until the end. After 3 days they will rise again. After that, Jesus Christ will return and take over the world. After a thousand years, there will be a final war, and then the Judgement Day. On this day, if you have committed wrongdoings, you will be judged and sentenced for them. The sentence is to go to hell. If you do not want this, there is an easy way out. 1. Do not accept the chip. If you accept the chip the offer is off the table. Get beheaded instead. That's a quick and painless death. 2. Understand that when Jesus as a 100% innocent man was crucified by Satan, God could fairly forgive you your sins as Jesus' death has paid the price. Say aloud to God, "God, please forgive me for all me wrongs. I ask Jesus to come into my heart and be my Lord." This is a transaction, a one-time event where you are forever changed. God will put a new spirit within that wants to be good. Jesus will guide you. You will be able to truly love others and be free from Satan's dominion. Even if you have sins you can't control no matter how hard you try, these are covered under the transaction, so don't worry about them.
this gives time a whole new prespective
sorry, what was that about a nuclear reactor in the Statherian?
not to complain, this is super cool, but can we also have a version without the VO pls?
Came for the science, stayed for the techno beats
Langezagt!
Bro, the music, is phenomenal!!! I was vibing the whole time!! That drums is sick ❤
I fucking love it! Great one! Thank you.
🤩
Let me just say, your channel does so much for science inquiry, especially with youngsters! I have a few of my own, and they love the animation! They have so many great questions when they watch your videos!
The mentioning of complex life so late into the video really puts into perspective the wonder of almost entropy defying structures,, this is the one true miracle that ever has and probably ever will happen.
Wow i think this is their longest video, literally an animated  documentary this must have taken so many hours wtf. Btw as a university student i can't help but say this channel has quality and their information seems legit because of their sources and how they are presented. Well done, you guys have an amazing channel. Edit:  im at 37 min. in the video, its nice but i was expecting a bit more in depth explainations, it seems there are a lot of "blank" spaces with music.
Oh my, the Kurzgesagt gang have really outdone themselves on this one! Here I am sitting here watching this Herculean effort put together by some crazy-ass talented people, eating the most perfect summer mango that life has produced, and I am overwhelmed at how we live in the most perfect time of 'life' (human issues right now notwithstanding). "Congratulations if you are still here?"= it's the least we can do after your production. Well done, well done.
"History of earth in the nutshell"
The camraman been alive longer then earth to record such events.
sublime
good job guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wow...
Because not much visual things happen in this video, watching it makes my brain get lost in its thoughts and eventually video ideas emerge. So I should re-watch this video when I need more content topics
I see and hear the shadow of Shona
My new favorite video to  study to 📚
I loved it. But why why didnt you include more info
Waw! Now the phrase "This never happened in human history" is getting a new meaning. A less significant one :-)
Not useful video but with enormous work in animation^ so with negative value
How were they able to animate all of this?
Damn quality content
There's a whole new perspective for me now. I kind of knew that life has not been around here too long, comparatively and humans even less so. But we only had one or few seconds at the end.
ABA
You guys are totally crazy, and we love it❤ thank you for being one of the best channels on YT, keep it up and never ever stop!🤩
This would be a really good live wallpaper
Lovely.
❤
Amazing idea and execution!
Masterpiece
This was oddly sentimental. It was quite a journey, all to arrive at the world of today. I felt quite moved by the very nature of this video, and baffled at the detail that populates it. Thanks for making this.
Great animation; lots of time spent on it. Terrible script; written in 10 minutes. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Wow! just wow
This took me more than 6 hours to write and document to pass the time, and thank you for this being so easy to understand. Thank you!
Good visuals for the set.
Thank you, I enojyed it alot.
Next time, do a video on earths history in real time. JK, nice video!
Would love a version with out the music, it covers up the rain and nature sounds
It's perspectives like this that actually make me happy to exist
Captivating! Whole hour was an absolute delight. Thank you all so much for your work!
this would make a great moving computer background
turns out making a hour long vid about the entire planet's history isnt that hard
Please please make a portrait version to have as a live wall paper please I beg
how the diggity dog did they animate an hour's worth of history
The Hadean hellscape vibes 🔥🔥
Kurzgesagt deserves 4.5 billion likes and subscribers that's for sure.
Can someone explain how rain just started During Eorchian?
44:57 the sex update
The music in this is so cool. Well done!
This is definitely my favorite channel ever
Langgesagt
Hi
Wow, this project started in 2019. It took them almost 5 years to make this and now it's available for free for everyone!
This is ridiculously amazing, it really hits home how long history is
Thanks you Kurz.
This is incredible, love the creativity and effort that went into making this! 💜🌌☄🌍
Actually guys this video doesn't have entirely up to date information now that it's 6 hours old
Time to watch my origin story.
This is an absolute masterpiece. I love it!
What a video. As someone who lives in the UK "it rained for a million years" really hit home.
I feel like Fry in the Futurama episode 😊
This is just wonderful. My friend and I watched the lot and we were enchanted. Thank you to everyone at @Kurzgesagt. Brilliant.
this is amazing i love your videos keep it up!
No joke,it takes these guys 1200 hours to make a fifteen minute video.the amount of work that went to this is actually insane
It's so insane to think that it took an hour of going 1 million years a second to get to humans and everything we ever did was over in 1 second
Amazing work!
In Hadean times playing "the floor ist lava" must have been a hell of a game.
Excellent video!!
Even tho im a Christian and also a chreationist, ive been watching kurzgesagt since its infancy, and i really love the channel, as an aspiring animator myself i can relate to how long it took to make, despite the many loops and duplicates 😂😊😅
my favorite part was 29:43 when there was a glitch in the matrix
These are the people who couldn't sit through the entire video so they kept skipping until the end.
Amazing video. Truly amazing!! Thank you, you made my life better. Incredible work.
Wow
I will watch this later, but I hope there is a bill wurtz joke in here
This is the extended cut of the "the history of the world i guess" video lol
Yeah wasn’t that long ago
A different approach then Bill Wurtz
This was beautiful. Thank you for such a cool video. This channel is the best. There is always something new to learn through you guys.
I believe that whatever hit us and formed the moon, also contained the basics for life … would be awesome!!   There are some theories that life its older than earth itself
Ok.... heart me out.  I fully recognize how painstaking this may have been to make.... BUUUUUUT can this be an occasional series exploring what we know about other planets too?? Pretty please??  I'd love to see Venus done in this format!
45:00 thank you bangiomorpha pubescens, very cool
kurzgesagt has really done it this time
THIS MIXTAPE ABSOLUTELY SLAPS.  Awesome animation as always of course but this MUSIC!! I'll 100% be letting this run in the background while I do work in the future.
I've been a Subscriber since 12016. You continue to amaze me. Happy anniversary!
Didn’t realise that multicellular life came so late in Earth’s history
1 hour 3 minutes and 31 seconds, and there we are, existing our entire human history in a fraction of a second
Dat sound
I'm sorry, what?! An hour long Kurzgesagt video?! Wow. Thank you!  Edit: Not what I expected, but lovely all the same.
I've been wanting a long-form Kurzgesagt video for so long. I know how much time and effort goes into your animations and research even on the 10 minute video scale, but it can feel exhausting to keep up - especially when you jump from one really cool idea to immediately to another. I don't mind slower or repeated animations and spaced out writing. This still feels lightly engaging, while also avoiding that frantic elevator pitch feeling that I get from so many YouTube videos these days.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, I absolutely love History of the Universe's channel. Yes, his hour-long videos are normally just voice recordings overtop a repeating abstract background animation, but the pace of his writing and speaking is super comfortable.
We need the 4.5 billion year version of this
amazing animation but too many silent parts and it wouldn't have hurt to skip through it.
Blink and you'll miss a million years
My life is meaningless.
The whole video is amazing of course, but the song is like the ultimate prog track 😂 amazing
Cool
what an amazing soundtrack. it is worth the hour watching just because of it
59:37 Such a paradise! - Aaand its gone, anyway...
They lived 4.5 billion yet ya'll speedruned that in 1hr      Why does my comment look like hate-
58:13  HE SAID IT! HE SAID THE THING!
Truly beautiful. Wonderful job.
this needs to become a loop wallpaper on wallpaper engine or something
.
An hour long Kurzgesagt video that too about the history of the Earth. Looks like Christmas came early!
Fabulous. Thank you.
After this, I should go and watch Gav falling into a pool for one hour over at Slow Mo Guys' to calm down from all this rush.
are we not going to elaborate on the statherian nuclear reactor
This is the longest video I've ever seen from you. Major probs to those who put their time and effort into it, thank you so much for this video
How does nobody give credit to the absolute banger music?? I let this run as i cooked and just started dancing in the kitchen
Now we need a 10 hour version of this!
An absolute masterpiece, your Magnun Opus. Thank you for entertaining and educating so many people for all these years. I finally got a chance to buy IMMUNE a few days ago, and I’m so excited to read it.
Wow. Human beings have only existed for the blink of a cosmic eye, so to speak.
And to thing all of human history is only a hundredth of a second at this time scale….
Im so stoned. This is sick!!
Seriously, naming the first organism which invented sex 'bangiomorpha' is either high level trolling or a huge coincidence.
NÃO funciona na rua
44:58 True
Bill Wurtz did it better but this is acceptable
28:20 is basically Terraria with that amazing background music. Only missed it by about 2450 million years 😔
Ohmagad ! Is it my bday !?
59:39 "Life is thriving, nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that?" The Kurzgesagt narrator killed the dinosaurs confirmed
Got me dancing 🕺
I'll put this whole video as my Wallpaper
Maybe after millennia this might not be the truth anymore..
this need the extended version :)
I miss Tim tim
Amazing!!!!
You can make a religion out of that
0,0015% of one frame of this video is the span of an average human lifetime
Wait, if the Earth's iron core only formed in the Ectasian, does that mean that Earth didn't have a protective magnetic field until then? No wonder life had such a hard time getting started if it was being bombarded by cosmic rays all the time! And, relatedly, maybe this is why life and then surface life was able to start diversifying about this time - anything that came out of the water before this probably got fried.
This doesn't matter. The sun will explode therefore deleting YouTube. Cry about that!
The music guy had no reason to go  this hard
I swear the Tool influence in some of that soundtrack is awesome!
The music is such a vibe! ❤
“Where there are rocks, watch out! Watch out, because the rocks are going to eventually come alive and they are going to have people crawling over them. It is only matter of time, just in the same way the acorn is eventually going to turn into the oak because it has the potentiality of that within it. Rocks are not dead. You see, it depends on what kind of attitude you want to take to the world…....“ Alan Watts
also the music throught the video is fire
Very nice to know that the algae bangiomorphia pubescens might have invented sex. xD Jokes aside tho, the amount of stress out planet has gone through is just unbeliveable, meanwhile i get stressed out on a loading screen taking too long.
Thank you for giving me something to watch while I worked out.
Props to whoever did the music. Making an hour of continuous music interesting is no easy task.
44:53 Sex was invented 1200 million years ago
cannabis vaporizer existance is how long in this time scale?
Please tell me I’m not the only one who burst into tears at the end! Thanks team, that was incredible❤
Was wondering why meteors had trails of fire if there was no atmosphere, then heard we had a co2 atmo.... Gg.
a 1h-long kurzgesagt video.... I definitely have to buy some weed
this is so relaxing, fascinating and interesting at the same time
Is there a music free version of this with just the sound effects and narration?
Wow
Great video ! If you want to watch it quickly, you can use the transcript to jump to the parts with the narrator. The button to open it is at the bottom of the description
This is more than edutainment. This delves into the richness of life as it evolved out of a chaotic environment. It's a realistic story for how we got here, and it is, to me, a lot more beautiful than the genesis stories of the Bible, Torah, Quran, Rigveda, and so on.
i sense celeste ost inspirations
Truly a work of art!  It was an unforgettable experience, thank you so much!
This as a wallpaper is a need.
A one hour Kurzgesagt video is a blessing
This feels like a good argument against the Fermi Paradox
Amazing! I need to put this on loop and run it 24hours a day
Currently stuck in the Ediacaran
Now imagine if it starts from the big bang
I thought this was just going to be like a 1 hour documentary, but this is cool too.
Uhm, I'm a big fan of the channel, but I have I've been a bit disappointed in this one. Such a nice animation and topic, so much to show, but so little narration. I understand that it took ages to animate and would've taken ages to create a nice script for the whole hour, but... there were a lot of moments worth pointing out. Like when the moon began to cool down and solidify in the beginning, some fun facts here and there, more comments on what's going on in the other parts of the world, etc. And yeah, I know there was a period called "boring billion" but there was still actually a lot going on. So why not to make it more... full sorta?
A vast majority of this video is lo-fi/background music to have an existential crisis to. And I am here for that.
the new lofi
I NEEEEEEED the score for this video so I can play it over and over until I get bored... please!
The music sure was badass back then!
can we get this without the ost i need 4.5 Billion Years of asmr
me likey
incredible work, keep doing it! thank you so much
An hour video from you guys yes!!!!!
loving your content mate
We demand the same video but for the universe right from the big bang! Please ❤
Kurzgesagt: "you can play it in background, studying" **Music at **19:56** drops** Me: *starts handbanging* Also me: "kurzgesagt please stop! I can't see any letteffggte"
I love these long videos, please do more! I would love to learn more in depth!
Now make the same, but into the future please.
I absolutely LOVE this video. Thank you so much for making it💜❤💜
It's outrageous that we get this for free. Thank you.
this must have taken 4.5 billion years to animate XD
learning earth lore. gotta love it
I’m absolutely psyched to crawl into bed nice and early tonight, and watch this entire video before falling asleep
Great work Kurzgesagt, music is well thought too. But why not make the timeline logarithmic?
I'm grateful for every second of my life.
I feel like you took a page out of the book of pwnisher :D but what a good spin on it!
The video was so good, even the cat watched it for 2.5 billlion years
a whole HOUR long? what did we do to deserve this. y'all are amazing
Lovely
Of course that was really good
58:08 my favorite line
Maybe they did have techno back then...
Have scientist discovered why every couple hundred million years earth turned into a Google Pixel ad?
1 hour vid i love you so muchhhhhhhhh
123!
I need to donate you guys wtf
WOW, THIS is content
such an amazing video. and then theres a typo its million instead of billion i feel so bad for the people who would be willing to edit it lol. (wait i think im dumb)
Here before 1M views 👇
Good video. But still love Bill Wurtz’s version!
Happy anniversary kurzgesagt you're the best thing that happened to Youtube❤🎉
Thank you more making such a fantastic piece accessible to all
That was a wonderfully chill hour, and one that I'll certainly go back to from time to time. Thank you, everyone at Kurzgesagt, and happy 10th anniversary !
Seriously, if you want to watch one thing on YouTube, watch this.   This is what a YouTube video should look like.  Kudos to all the people who made this possible. And for free!!!
Thank you! Been following for years.
That was crazy!
W video
This video will help me get my dissertation written. I can feel the motivation building.
This is the most unique video on YouTube
the music slaps.
epic guys! 😍🤩😍
While interesting as always, the animation feels a bit low effort this time (for 4000 milion years). Its like an anime background scrolling by. Was expecting a bit more entertaining/interesting animations.  I mean even when the first continents formed theres no animation of it :(
the musicin this is MENTAL. So damn good
You should make a part 2 of this that goes 4.5 billion years into the future Edit: i just got to the part of the Video that said that this took them 4 years to make 💀
WHAAT???
Where can I nominate this for Best Music Video of the Year 12,023?
Volcanic rock can float...is that what we are seeing during the early Eoarchean?
That was one of the best YouTube Videos I've ever seen
Comment for algo amazing
There are a few animation glitches and errors. Still very impressive for an hour of free content.
Archean oceans would have been green from dissolved Iron.
Fuuuuuuuuuck this is cool. Well worth the wait.
Watch it at 0.00063513x for a more Immersive experience
3:50 TIL Earth's first dance party started 4.3 billion years ago.
I have watched hours of PBS Eons. Even going so far as to watch a playlist that put their vids in rough chronological order one time. Most of that... was the last ten minutes of this vid. Crazy.
Wow what a video.
No way I’m skipping through this one
amazing!
Its amazing how this is just evidence of science and God working together. Science and Christianity actually dont disagree at all, no matter what the young earth creationists tell you. This is the "seven days" in the Bible. We christians are not all crazy, folks.
SPLENDID! (Chiefly British) EXCELLENT! (US & Canada) Nicely done! (Me) Terrific concept.
OH MY GOD THEY MADE A 1 HOUR VIDEO
*The sun is a deadly laser!*
Isn’t the earth grand?
hey guys.. excellent video.. i just have one question and i would be thrilled if you can answer. WHEN IT FIRST RAINED IN THE EOARCHEAN PERIOD, WHERE DID THE WATER COME FROM OR HOW WAS THE FIRST WATER FORMED?
1hr well spent
This is amazing! I want to ask for an eventual sequel (maybe for your 20th anniversary?) that's the entire history of the universe in an hour, except that instead of all the action being packed into the last 25%, it'd be more like the last 8%. What about a logarithmic version, where early time passes more quickly and things slow down near the present? Or would that defeat the point?
I'm sorry, an HOUR long Kurzgesagt?!  Would have been nice to know I was about to learn everything.  And here I am with no celebrations prepared. My dear communicators thank you so kindly but you should really call ahead next time.
lore lore
Dang kurzgesagt changed so much over the past few years huge respect for this vid wrapping it all up
Amazing to think that the first YouTube ad slot was over 3.6 billion years ago.
7:12 The moon becomes out of view, and earth solidifies a bit. 11:30 Water completely covers the surface. 12:40  The train goes underwater. 17:55  The train comes back up to a beautiful scene. 23:18  Back under the train goes. 26:57 The train sinks more. 27:49  The train gets to shallow waters. 30:10  Ice coats the planet as we go back under. 30:34 The train comes up to see snow-coated land. 37:23  Night falls, and the moon in shown further away. 39:52  Clouds rise from the ground. 41:56  Day breaks, and the moon fades from view. 47:22  The sky becomes green 👻, but also gas releases. 51:06  An ice-age view is revealed, with blue skies. 52:00 The ice thaws, before refreezing. 52:22  Again, we go underwater. This time, with cells. 53:32 Multi-cellular life emerges, big-time. 54:09  Animal life emerges. 54:44 We are shown a deeper view of the ocean. 55:46 Land-life grows, the train comes back up. 56:41  Biomes emerge, and plants adapt further. 57:19 The earth changes into an animal growth period. 58:03  Dinosaurs emerge, nothing will kill them, right? 59:47 Something kills them. You should know what it is. 1:00:24  Mammals take full control, and we near the end. 1:00:44  Humans evolve, and that wraps up everything. Thank you.
An hour long Kurzgesagt video! You spoil us!
Theia didn't crash the moment it formed
1 Blink is 0.2s  0.2s X 1,500,000 years per second = 300,000 years.  So don't blink, or you might miss 300,000 years 😮
What a masterpiece. I stand completely speechless. So awe inspiring! I can only imagine how much of a demanding endeavor that was! Everything, from the animation and editing up to the music and narration was absolutely perfect. There is really no way of putting it into words. I hope you never stop doing what you do, cause this right here is a legacy of invaluable worth. Fare well!!!
Truly the best YouTube channel.
Such a Gem. I loved everything about it.
I dare anyone to finish the entire vid Nice video btw
Amazing beyond words
I have no words to explain the love that i carry with those videos your artwork is progressing in a such a good way i cannot even decribe that lol
Me looking at rocks for the first 50 minutes of the video... Kurzgesagt- "Don't blink or you'll miss ALL of human history..." *shows a human rubbing rocks together for 2 seconds while awkwardly looking at the 4th wall* Kurzgesagt-  "And that was it"  Me- "r u serious"  (This is a joke btw)
Amazing video and soundtrack!
All the efforts put into this is sooooo greatly appreciated <3
You seem to have skipped the rock eating giant fungi towers that later form a symbiote connection with the algae on the shores that give life to plants. Just saying.
Wait, water just formed on its own due to cooling
An absolute masterpiece, I learnt more in the hour about our planet than I learned at school, and since this needs to be shown in schools. The animation is wonderful, too. Thank you.
Love the Tool influences heard around the Tonian era
Someone sat down and said "now time to compose an opus like the world has never seen" and produced the banger of a backing track!  Loved the bass line during the Mesoarchean!!!
wow this is such an AAWESOME idea!!!!
Just rendering this video must of took hours
Longest video they have ever made Major W to anyone who's involved with this project
bro bill wurtz did this in 19 minutes 26 seconds
I love how well you guys can put everything into perspective. It really humbles me and makes me feel ... just, a lot!
Bruh... Ecstasian to Cryogenian sounds Lit! 👌 seriously, not only the music amazing, but everything in this video amazing job!!! ❤
Kudos for the hypnothizing beats. Great flow <3
Great video as always, shame it doesn’t display how many years has elapsed.
Whoever produced the background music IS AN UNBELIEVABLE GENIUS
The music in the Mesoarchean era goes hard! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Let him cook!
So this has to be 'lang gesagt' oder 'long said'
44:57 Dude I will never have that, bad decision
One of the most special videos available in all of streaming media, for sure. The sound alone is just amazing, it is the closest we can get (so far) to an actual trip through the complete history of our planet and ourselves. Puts a lot into perspective. Congratulations and thanks for that.
For the sake of maintaining accurate linear scaling, for the first 8 minutes, basically nothing happened / changed - and i absolutely love and respect that. It might not work as a general format, but as a once-off special, this is an absolute masterpiece.
You're truly awesome 🎉 Congratulations 👏🏽🎉
Just sat watching this for 4,5 billion years in my couch and it never became boring. Amazingly done. Thank you Kurzgesagt!
The Mesoarchean was the most metal age. 🤘
I think it's really a testament to the sheer ability of life on Earth to adapt and evolve that we've had such sick electronic beats for literally billions of years.
That was...incredible. Wow! You guys are something else. Thank you so much!
It says eucaryotes emerged 2,2 billion years ago and here you mentioned that happened 1,6 bilion years ago, where did you get that information
22:36 this bit fire 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you for this
If only the commentary was also 4.5 billion years long 😢
just mindblowing how insignificant we humans really are. Take care of this rock in space we call home people!
Thank you so much😊keep it up
... damn
Enjoying the soundtrack 🙂 Much hot and comfy...?😂
45:00 the invention of sex!
Apparently the mesoarchaean is when the doom music drops ☠️
1 Hour Earth History music to study/work/sleep to.
This is probably going to be the best video on YouTube.
This has to be the easiest money yall have ever made.  Don't get lazy on me now 🧐
Big thank you to the whole team! A one hour video for free is amazing, you guys are truly dedicated to education and the crafting of beautiful art ❤
Me: sees the title. Me: YES.
There’s no way you just dropped this video
Awesome soundtrack too, specially the djent parts!
I have to watch this will high !!
This video is just different! I've never come to realize how short life and human existence truly is in comparison to the Earth's history. Thank you for this new perspective, Kurzgesagt Team!
how much time did these animators spend in total on this one project? huge props to the animators
love it
I haven’t words for how incredible this is.
Thanks :)
How nice for the camera man to record 4.5billion years of history for us
am i the only one who added this to his favourites before even watching it?
Can I work for you?
Great stuff! Would be awesome to have the same video concept but for the Universe. Starting from the Big Bang💥💥
55:46 Oh it's this guy... The one fish thing that decided to crawl onto land now we all gotta pay taxes... GET BACK IN THE WATER
imagine how patient the camera man is :0 they recorded for 4.5B years straight :0
Freue mich schon wenn das Video auf Deutsch hochgeladen wird
The single best terraria background mod ever made…
I love the techno in the background
Kurzgesagt feat Epic Mountain Music feat Danny Carey, apparently.  Fantastic.
This one is epic i must say
44:58
Genau was ich gebraucht habe, eine Stunde ein fantastisches Video über die Erdgeschichte ansehen!!❤
I love the fact that in the future this video might need to be remade as we find out more about our long past can’t wait to see what our future can help us discover about our past
I love you guys, Best channel ever
7:20 "it's still much hot and comfy"
Superb.
1:35 this is why I love Kurzgesagt 😂😂😂
What an absolute amazing video.  Please consider releasing a video with just the music (no narration) because I could see myself listening to this while I'm trying to concentrate on work.
The Hadean is definitely a good period to scroll through the comment section :) Great work!
That's some incredible music too.
29:43  🤖
As soon as I saw saw kurzgesagt and a 1 hour video I immediately click. I’m so grateful that we all get this for free. THANK YOU KURZGESAGT!!!! ❤️
It's so cool that it's just simplified real life
Brilliant. Thank you so much for this.
MAKING CLAIMS SUCH AS A NATURAL NUCLEAR REACTOR BEING CREATED BY NATURE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE CONTEXT????
I still didn’t grasp how long that was, could you make an animation that lasts 4.5 billion years?
I'm really happy I was able to see all your names at the end of the video! Congratulations to everyone for this masterpiece!
There's an important inaccuracy in the time-lapse of the history of earth's development, namely that there is already multiple different pieces of evidence that demonstrate that complex animal wildlife has been present on earth not only about 400 million years ago or about 600 million years ago but already 1.6 billion years ago, at least in the oceans, but it was harder to find evidence for it since fossils weren't as robust yet.
I can’t wait to binge this, but the “in a nutshell part” is being kinda stretched here lol
I love that although each segment is broken into one scene, there are still parts of each scene that evolve over time! The sun rising, moon shrinking, mountains growing.... I can only IMAGINE how long this video took to make!
3:49 DJ LAVA ON THE FLOOR
This is absolutely the best video I've ever seen. EVER ❤
Absolutely incredible video! I want literally all of your posters but they won't all fit on my wall 😂
Tracklist?
Thank You for this.
Kurzgesagt ASMR isn't real it cant hurt you Kurzgesact :
loved the part where doom music started playing
Incredible work! Loved every second of this.
Finest goyslop so far
Me who watched the whole video, still wanting more 👀
I’m playing this the next time I run.
The first thought that passed through my head. I'm not going to miss a second of this masterpiece
And after you die, a septuagintillion years will pass in the blink of an eye and the universe as we know it will cease to exist. Enjoy your short life.
Watched the whole thing and all I got was a lousy t-shirt. Okay, it wasn't lousy. And it wasn't a t-shirt but a hoodie.  Thank you for 10 years of edutainment! Vielen Dank für 10 Jahre Bildungs-Unterhaltung!
Great video! <3
“Don’t blink or you might miss all of human history” *cuts to Pizza Hut ad* Yeah that makes sense
Next step: make a video in this style, but covering all of history, starting at the big bang.
Watched the whole thing, this was the perfect length to listen to while making dinner!
the earth started on world 8 of super mario bros wii and went backwards
Insane quality! Absolutely staggering to watch and a total joy! Thank you! 🙏🏻
Sound like terraria music
It wasn't the video that made me reflect on life, it was the very, very long wait that made me reflect life.
Watched it all, I felt little. Thank you for the amazing video!  I wish I had access to this channel growing up 📚   *I would be interested in seeing how the continents were formed overtime too!
I liked it. Evolution at a glance.🎉❤
I know, not I guess. :/
1 hr of kurzgesagt let’s gooooooooo
Im fina get drunk tonight and watch this.
Ok guys, I knew you were cool, but not "let's make an hour long video" cool
(i say this before watching any of the video)  A 1-hour Kurzgesagt video? If ever there was a time to watch youtube on a VR headset for full immersion, this is it!
BABE WAKE UP, KURZGESAGT DROPPED A WHOLE HOUR LONG MOVIE!!!
To watch this clip while you are a Muslim, you have a tremendous feeling of greatness and divine power, what a feeling✨🖤
"It's still much hot and comfy" -Kurzgesagt
We’ve finally found it. The successor to Bill Wurtz’s “history of the entire world, I guess” video.
Getting terraria vibes from both the graphics and the soundtrack. Very nice :D
Stat comment
1:36, the floor is lava…
gonna watch this in the original speed.
Humans fucked it all up in the space of a second 😢
29:43 Anyone else notice the glitch at the bottom of the screen here? Graphics card failing during original video render perhaps?
Best video ever this is real nice 4.550 million years into only one hour
OMGG OMG OMGGGG THIS VIDEO WAS FUCKIN PHENOMENAL!!!!! I LOVE THUS VIDEO SO MUCHHHHHH GRAAAAAAAA
56:51 "oh fuck, now everything's dead. just kidding here are the survivors. keep an eye on this one because it's about to become the dinosaurs"
Organisms getting wild in the Stenian era
Dang. Crazy that it took them 0.0000032 seconds to produce this video.
An hour long Kurzgesagt video? This is awesome!
Explain the research and theories based on these times and not just a blue screen with particals here and there
The cambrian dlc was such a game changer i loved the bigger lifeform patches
@37:05 - Nice work @Kurzgesagt!  I was amazed and pleasantly surprised to see you mention Earth's first nuclear fission reactor - it was about 1.7B years ago and completely natural.  If anyone is wondering how - it is because U235 decays faster than U238, and in order to get reactors to work today in ordinary "light" water, you need enrichment to increase the ratio of U235 in the fuel (typically 3-5% on new fuel).  Because of the difference in uranium decay rates, there was more U235 around back then, about 3% vs the 0.7% today, so a natural nuclear reactor from it was possible and did happen.  If anyone wants to see what nuclear waste looks like after 1.7B years ago (no real damage but it is cool) look up the "Oklo natural nuclear reactor".
1 HOUR KURZGESAGT VIDEO?? HELLO?
This video should have been 20 minutes lol. Not trying to vibe out to rave music and watch a Newgrounds animation for minute long spans lol.
A FULL HOUR long video? This is incredible and I’m speechless
i'm less than a second old
We need this Video Concept also for the UNIVERSE himself
Long format content should at the very least have talking throughout and not every 3 to 5 minutes when people start clicking off
@kurzgesagt Can you post another version of this with the music but no voiceover?
Thank you so much! Such hard working science guy ❤️ lots of love from Bangladesh ❤️❤️
It feels like cheating for me to play this at 2x
You absolutely smashed that one out of the park!!! Splendid tunes,  rolling visuals and a peppering of narration is spot on. We demand more this!
I'm not joking when I say this is one of the best videos I have seen on youtube ever, congratulations to every individual involved.
Climate does change naturally but clearly takes longer than 200 years
Have been watching your videos for years & this is a masterpiece. ❤
Welp, I know what I'm doing for the next hour.
Getting EuroMIR vibes
This was such a brilliant video for so many reasons. The animation was gorgeous, the cheeky references to different life forms like sharks, trilobites and Dunkleosteus were amazing and the music! The music was fantastic. Really loved this :)))))))
Amazing 👍
Bravo!!! 👏👏👏
Epic
This is amazing. Wonderfully done. Props to the whole team.
this is the best kind of video
This video made me realise just how old the earth really is and how we've literally only been here for a fraction of its history! I was sure we would appear much sooner than less than 1 million years ago but when i think about it it really was quite obvious how new we are! Amazing video 😊
And apparently you don’t really understand how the earths early stages really played out or looks so it’s a HUGE waste making it the first half hour of the video
Love this❤
Outstanding. Truly.
Wow, a long video? This is awesome! Great work team kurz!
From a geological point of view you should not brag about how long it took you guys to create this outstanding piece of work.
this is incredible.
Amazing animation! I cant wait for the mario style platformer to come out with this background and music. Jk
That was excellent 👌
Yo Bill Wurtz, where you at? We need a hour and a half video on the history of the universe now.
The Paleoarchean era music seems inspired by Michael Jackson's "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"
Ok, please make a video about this weird Earth's core history.
So sad how the age of reptiles disappeared in a blink of an eye.
I'm sorry but bill wurtz beat you to it.
Thank you for such an amazing video! It help me appreciate the human lifespan in perspective with the massive cosmic scale events. It leaves me dazzled with how much humanity has changed the world and how much more can happen in the future.
i made popcorn
Huge props to everyone involved, what a cool idea for a video.  Also great choice to have synth music as a baseline and the Doom innuendo during the Mesoarchean was pretty funny.
i'll leave this for my next movie night!
You guys are true treasures of the internet and one of YouTube’s best. ❤
The music is so No Man’s Sky, I love it! It’s a perfect fit for this kind of video. It’d be cool if you do this type of video more!
Wow, this was awesome, thank you for this. 😮❤😊
Absolutely stunning.❤
Where can I acquire this soundtrack?
Amazing!!!! 🎉🎉
how is this amount of quality free?
No way I get an hour long episode, this is gonna be great always love your videos
I thought water came from icy asteroids and comets, not rain
holy shit, they made history of the entire world I guess 2
Love your work and what you guys do music is amazing keep up the good work.😊
This is simply breathtaking. I cant imagine how long it must have taken
The Mesoarchean era music reminds me of Doom's Soundtrack
this soundtrack makes a great study playlist
This is insane. A full hour! This not only puts you as one of the best science channels, but also one of the best animating channels! Incredible work! 🎉
that was so good
This is fantastic! Kudos, Kurzgesagt!
its still much hot and comfy?
In speachless. I love the animations and especially the music. Props to all of you! This made my week, and maybe even my month. Thanks for all the inspiration and nowleage you have been giving me over the years and i hope you will be able to give me more. ❤️
I blinked
Brava brava!!!
All that before GTA 6
its insane how this showcases that life has existed for so long and yet our form of life, visible multicellular life is so new including u ourselves.
Well i already knew that multicellular life was new but now i think i really understand.
It's always terrifying to imagine that "complex life" (cambiram) just started on the last 7 minutes of the earth. We are just a chapter in the human era, which is a chapter in Earth history. However, every human being is full of stories and chapters during its lifetime.
Now this is a unique one. Will have to rewatch it later at super fast speed as a background visual, its so pretty, an almost uninterrupted scroll timeline. <3
The amount of work this must have taken to produce is insane, S tier content.
Very interesting concept!
Little glitch thing at 29:43
45:04
This is amazing. No words.
My takeaway from this is if we want to find a habitable planet, we might be looking at finding 4.5 billion of them before we find one suitable for our form of life at the precisely right stage in its evolution.
This is the definition of a waste of recourses, the same could be explained in half the time with more content, less effort on your part and on the editors part
This my wallpaper now love all of there work
I watched this whole thing with my eyes glued to screen this is one of the best things I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time
I will show this video to my kids in future
This soundtrack has to drop on spotify as an album
Ok pero la MÚSICA ESTA INCREIBLE
This is one of the coolest science videos ever made
Kurzgesagt just made an hour long documentary of our planet’s history, I think I’ll watch this as a movie! ❤
Great video! You could have also added avg temp through the video.
Anyone else wanna see them make a part 2?
I need to watch it on LSD.
Videos like these highlight how insignificant each and every one of us is, a century of a human lifetime not even registering on those timescales. We are nothing, nothing but dust.
THATS SO HYPE
I always knew that human existence is basically just a blink of an eye in the history of the entire planet. But seeing how 'boring' the planet was for soooooooo much time really put life into a whole different perspective. Wow!
This is coll
When i Started watching this it had about 60k likes, now, almost an hour later it has almost 85k likes. Thats also quite impressive.
truwe
My new best soundtrack 💛
Incredible! We finally got our 1 hour Kurzgesagt video!!!!
I have watched it twice so earth is 9 billion years old. It felt like an hour ago when the earth was still 4.5 billion years old
Truly reminds us how amazing it is to be alive in this earth and how we must cherish it. Its so beautiful and insane and to realize we live in but a fragment of it. In our everyday lives we dont realize how small we are and how much we must enjoy and appreciate every moment. Its good to be reminded of it from time to time.  I wish I could see how Earth really looked like throughout all of this with my own eyes. I can't even imagine the feeling. Also this music is crazy good, an amazing soundtrack to this experience. So fun and well suited for each stage. Fantastic work.
Using the power of math, this is around 1.25million per second.
Give me like 5 hours I'll be back. Perfect bedtime video
The music of this video is amazing so chill.
great work
The music! Omg!
Didn't realize how much I needed this 😅 loved this so much!
Thank you so much for this. I'm currently studying for an exam, this would really help me focus.
55:55 the reason we all have to pay taxes.
Congratulations. What a work of art.
5 hours ago and only 500k views? COME ON YOUTUBE!
Just wondered, maybe stupid question, but in the cryogenian wenn all of the earth froze, you said that we were not sure how life survived? But how do we know that it didn’t restart after? Maybe DNA is more common then what we might believe?
bill wuztz did it better
have you ever heard of wallpaper engine? it would take forever to download, but this should be on there
I just realized that the dude didn't even included most of the parts of Human History which is questionable why wouldn't he.....
Man, 10 whole years. That’s amazing. I still remember some of the videos from 5 years ago, being excited when a new one came out. Now I look back and think “X video is that old?” Time truly does fly, thank you for this masterpiece.
With a slow-paced video like this, you can truly appreciate the amazing animation and music. 🙃
Wow 1 hour of Kurzgesagt???! Seriously?❤❤❤❤❤
This music is such a bop wth
1 billion year mark gang
Tears of the kingdom reference :)
Congratulations on 10 years, this was really entertaining to watch, I liked the music a lot, where could I find it?
wow i cant believe the amount of effort put into this! nice!
Loved this video, the music is sooo satisfying!
What a cool concept!
Oh my goodness its "history of the world i guess" 2, Kurzgesagt Boogaloo  Edit: Oh its something to relax to nvm. Still amazing though, I cant imagine how long it would have taken to animate this  Edit 2: The music is AMAZING Ive only been in the Hadean era and it really fits in a way I can't describe...  Edit 3: 13:22 SHEEEEEESH THE BEAT Whoever did the music (I assume Epic Mountain ofc) did a banger job this is amazing  Edit 4: 2019?!?! And youve still given us monthly (plus extra) videos till now??? I need to get a poster or something cause i need to give you my money.
45 minutes in sex was finally added ahhhh yeah
Educational  Thank you for hard work
Absolutely a beautiful video. Thanks Kurzgesagt... I know what I'm getting h!gh to tonight.
what an amazing video, i watched it all!
I'm always waiting for you to make a new video update and I'm in shock by the one hour duration of video😲
Thank you a lot
How did it rain for millions of years? How did water get to the earth?
Thank you for this masterpiece, I knew before that we as humans were on this planet for only short period of time, compared to the whole life of this planet. I’ve never realised the sheer scale of the difference
Congratulations for your 10 years of pure nostalgic videos about reality. This one is the most ambitious video you've ever did.
This is... the best day of my life!
the shear scale is just amazing
This is magic
Create same video about Life in 4.5 billion years ago. When at 3.5 billion years ago, first cell came into existence in water. And when it started to double and reproduce. When first Alge came into existence.
45:00 yo Sex 0.1 alpha just dropped 💯💯
The soundtrack is so good.
29:44 got a corruption there buddy.
Omg this was amazing. I need the soundtrack. Please.
Like 👍🏼
The original proof that the cameraman really never dies.
Damnn imagine everybody watching this in science class in the future for the history of life and earth in the present
A 1 hour long animated video from one of my favorite channels? I must be dreaming.
The soundtrack is fire
This video is amazing Thank you very much. I never imagined it was so long before plants and animals came.
anyone catch the visual glitch at 29:43?
this was well worth the wait.
A video that took 4.5 Billion years to make, is remarkable. Well, Err Life always finds a way.
29:43 glitching rocks
It was an absolute delight to watch time pass at the scale of the Earth. Thank you for making this video.
nah, the camera mans built different💀💀💀 also, really cool vid!
In 5 hours
You are amazing, guys! ❤
The beats are so good. I was just having such a brilliant time
Sorry but this babbling in between is utterly distracting from studying... The music is great, for the narration, maybe do subtitles instead.
Thank you.
Incredible. Work of art.
This is great! We need more of these, fantastic work!
This is the best video you've made in my opinion.
Currently on the Mesoarchean. I swear to God this music is building up to become the DOOM 2016 OST.
We have come such a long way and so has Kurzgesagt! Kudos and congratulations! 🎊 please release a version with no dialogue if possible. Thank you!
Pro tip: you can use the (timestamped) transcript to see the video in 5x less time while retaining all the information, it's at the bottom of the video description
Mesoarchean was a true headbanger
Putting L and fc from the Drake Equation into context 😹
<3
This was a heavenly way to wake up to a Saturday morning
wonderful vid yall !!!
thank you for all your hard work! you rock! ;)
When the ad takes 15 million years...
19:38 i thought doom guy was about to jump out the ocean
That music absolutely fire tho 🔥 🔥 🔥
Kutzocramenty
It’s like y’all heard about what I was interested rn in and made this just for me :)
entire history of the world I guess - the sequel
Awesome, as a geography teacher I endorse this video. I doubt my students will have the attention span, but I will for sure suggest it to them. That way they can get a sense of just what tiny blip we are and how long it took for life to really bloom.
Thanks
45:00 truly the biggest achievment🗿
Brilliant video!
Dedicated photographer
The music is absolutely brilliant ❤
I'd love a version without the music.. the soundscape is quite relaxing.
This stuff has some DDR-worthy tunes.
I watched the entire thing... This is nothing short of beautiful. More than anything, it makes me realize the fragility of life and just how important it is to maintain it
45:03  Sex 1.0 released
If I could, I would have added a subscriber to every second and a  dollar to every 10 seconds!! Mashallah!🤌🤌🤌🤌
Damn Kurzgesagt I'm only a couple million years but this soundtrack BANGS
Ohh, this is great, I hope there are follow-ups that use the same concept but for shorter periods of time as we know more about it (and have more that 0.01s to talk about the whole of human history, for example).
This is honestly beautiful... Absolute Infinity / 10
The Mesoarchean Djent section was unexpected and delightful 🤟🎸
love this
Is there a version of this without the narrator?
I played Fortnite while watching this
Holy shit this was amazing
I’m trying to go hang out in that mesoarchean hot tub ocean
Yaya 1:01:48 i did it
So it took the moon like 200 million years to cool off? That seems crazy
Amazing!
Wow, just WOW! The sheer amount of dedication and the creativity to actually turn the concept "earth's history in one hour" into an ACTUAL ONE HOUR VIDEO OF EARTH'S HISTORY IN ONR HOUR!!!👏👏👏👏👏
I love this channel but this video sucks
This music is such a banger
no way we created wifi from this
I was shocked to see a video from Kurzgesagt that was an hour long, can't wait to watch :)
Put this one not realising how long it was and was playing a game some time and back to check and saw I had 30mins left lmaoo
cool
This video is great! However I was found longing for animations of specific events, abiogenesis, the asteroid impact mentioned in the orosiria era. Something that would really bring attention to these very important events
Absolutely loved every second of this <3
“Learning is knowledge, and knowledge is freedom and power. He knew that. He had forgotten that, somehow, but he knew it once more.” – Altaïr Ibn-La’Ahad
Wow
Can’t wait for the next 100 million year
The best part was when the humans showed up and...oh, nevermind, we're gone
What a wonderful jorney, thank you so much for this 😍!
I was so messmerised it took me 20 million years to write this
why do you keep on posting videos right after i have a test with the same subject 😩
Sad how how little part we have in earth's life and we almost destroyed it....
This is so awesome! Thanks Kurzgesagt team for putting this together. Love the soundtrack too :D
45:01 - The invention of sex
I would have never thought to see a 1 hour long Kurzgesagt video
Time to put this video on the metaphorical shelf with ‘entire history of the world, I guess.’
Simply amazing🥰
By the time I finished watching this, I was dead 4.49999999 Bn years ago
This is just the best video yet
I'd like very much to see an episode about the transition that led to the Cambrian explosion. Something doesn't add up. Earth have had single cell entities for millions years, and 'suddenly' thousands of species of highly complex organisms formed? What happened?
This took you guys 4 years to make for real?
Common kurzgesagt w
I'm not halfway into the video but I just wanted to say that I love how each scene evolves and merges with the next one, it's not just the same animation in a loop for each segment. You can watch it all and notice all those small details they made!
Perfect video and music to background light party. I must try! :D
now i understood why you guys took a while to release this new video, nice content!
An hour of Kurzgesagt nonstop? Christmas came eariy!
Kurzgesagt has reached an unprecedented level of quality from all of YouTube. This and Out of Scale hopefully mark a new era of Kurzgesagt: (also I am stuck on the first mission on out of scale and I can’t trigger anything new to happen.)
I like how all of the eons get shorter the closer to modern day we get.
As an artist, I'd love to know how many assets were created to make the landscapes look as varied as they do, and how many times those assets were reused.
I was listening to this while studying, and when I heard "...Invented sex..." I HAD to reqind it to make sure i heard it right.
damn Guys let's appreciate their efforts of making knowledge available for free
I love it, every second of it. The music was super soothing and I even heard a bit of others songs remixed into it as well. A masterpiece.
you should make a series explaining every period earth has went through and getting into it more in detail
Eoarcheon looks like Namek
How can i set this as my sceen saver?
This is the best video on YouTube ever! ❤
50-200 years later, ur gonna have to make a video about us on other planets and that planets History 😂
That moment when the moon says hi in the Statherian after abandoning us in the Hadean 😆
29:43 glitch in the matrix
WOW! JUST WOW! This is an amazing piece of art and I'm so glad I could experience it for free thanks to the amazing team at Kurtzgesagt. Even my ADHD was silent the whole hour. I just dont have the words to tell you guys how amazing this project is and how amazing I feel after watching it! Thanks for all the amazing video's and I wish that we can go for another 10 years, hopefully longer! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great music ❤
That was amazing. I loved how you can hear the left motifs of previous episodes in the eras. When the Jurasic Period ended the motif made me start crying.
Make a side-scrolling game of this.
Now do a three hour one for the universe! 😆
Hypnotic. 4 billion years flew by. Genuinely moving.
Patreon-worthy content right here
the fact human history is literally a second is astounding. thats it? its amazing to think of this hour long video only getting exciting around the last 10 minutes, and we exist in one second of the whole video, it puts into perspective very precisely how small our timeframe really is
This really illustrates how complex life really kind of just exploded.  Soooo...long...with...things...hardly...changing...at...all...and..then..all of a sudden omgthingsarechangingcrazyfast!
Congrats to the whole crew for the 10th year aniversity🎉🎉
Kurzgesagt, this is your most ambitious and intriguing video yet. Great job to everyone involved!
Hi
I would like this as my computer wallpaper
the ultimate "in a nutshell" video
So you basically went full Bill Wurtz mode? Nice 😎
finally the remastered edition of “history of the entire world, i guess”
This is all mind-blowing! Thank you!
Dude 1 hour of kurzgesagt?! This is going to be Amazing!!
Did he really leave me for 200 million years to let me think about whether he said "much hot" on purpose?!
Puré gold mate
Wonderful hour spent, thank you guys for everything you do for us ❤!
Watch it at 2x's speed and see it all in 30 min
i think there are so many amongus refrences
remember kids, sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago
now the question is: have they hidden a duck in here?
1 hour long ad. Oh my god
Great stuff. Came in expecting something like the "entire history of the universe, I guess", so was a bit disappointed at the lack of information towards the end... Still, this is as eye-opening as the horizontal-scrolling website that showed the solar system to scale and scrolled at the speed of light - I will never see space and time the same again. Thank you.
I loved this
"Life is still invisible to the naked eye" of course it is. eyes haven't been invented yet.
“Yo we need a track for a video, don’t make anything too crazy” *”ok”:*
seeing cambrian get mentioned even in a kurzgesagt video gives me joy 53:42 my baby anomalocaris yo
It's awesome to think that life has existed for about 1/5th of the universe's existence
isnt it meant to say billion not million on the top right corner?
And all of that just to set the perfect stage for the emergence of Human life and history. Whether you believe it was all designed by some grand architect or that it all just happened by random chance, you can't deny that it is beautiful.
wonderful, relaxing, and a lot of thoughts during some points
24:48
Kurzgesagt: Nothing much was happening in the Stenian.  Stenian: *invents sex*
Remember: Year 0 (12023 years ago) of the human era calendar occurs 0.0095 seconds (9.511 milliseconds) before the end of the timeline
Nice work, quit being left wing tho that shit is dumb lol
the wait is a stupid idea I skipped the whole video because of it .....
OH YES BABY ONE HOUR
Loved this vid. Watched it on second monitor while gaming. Mad props the composer for amazing music.the Rhyacian era music reminds a lot of the ride on space cowboy album by lazy lazer.
History is a lie don't listen to the mainstream scientists. They just want to push their narrative to keep us in chains. Go out there and research for yourself.
Amazing! Thanks for sharing with the world.
AN HOUR OF IN A NUTSHELL I AM DREAMING
I just realized what this music reminds me of. It is the sound track from a game call “oxygen not included”. Of course I could only be relating the two because this video and the game have a similar art style.
22:29
Now the real question is, how many times did the camera go around the whole earth during this whole video?
doom guy was made 3117 million years ago
Taiwan was once a permanent member state of the United Nations fighting off against japan in WW2. After that, it got exhausted and gave CHINA, CREATED BY MAO ZEDONG hiding within itself the chance to take over it's entire territory and what's more worse is that United States, United kingdom, France and Soviet Union agreed to replace Taiwan with China as a permanent member state of the United Nations and pretend the CHINESE CIVIL WAR NEVER HAPPENED, BASICALLY BETRAYING TAIWAN AND CALLING IT NOT A COUNTRY AND IS PART OF CHINA BY THOSE 4 COUNTRIES WHEN THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A COUNTRY NAMED CHINA BACK THEN IN WW2. WHAT THE PUCK UNITED NATIONS!😡
There is absolutely no reason or expectation for the music to hit this fucking hard. I was like "man i wish this was on apple music so i could just add it to my playlists" AND THERE IT IS!!! You guys are ludicris. Chill out. Keep being amazing.
Fatboy Slim did a similar video covering the complete timeline of our Earth’s life in only 4 minutes.
Woooooow 44:58 here the action begins
0:50 HELP THEA JUMPSCARE
1:00:38 - audio artifact.
1 hour !
This is art❤ thank you kurzgesagt team for creating this beautiful animation! You deserve an award
It amazes me, that the timeline of this Universe is only about three times longer than this.  I guess a three hour version of the Timeline of the Universe is due for release in about 473,040,000  years?
Bold try indeed
E.P.I.C. 😍
Now I know it takes 3.7 billion years to clean my apartment!
19:24 sounds like "the only thing they fear is you"
45:00 boys, we got em.  The inventors of sex... now we just gotta get em to enable the female orgasm.
Danke ihr Granaten!
i have a question . how would life be on earth if we had a moon the same size (maybe even same conditions ) as our earth ? will life still exist ? will this moon have life on it ? will our gravity be lighter ? or higher ? and many other scientific questions   please upvote this comment so maybe we can have a video about it some day :)
Congratulations on 10 years of this channel! This is a huge achievement. For scale, that is a tenth of a human life.
Bill Wurtz did it better hands down
I love this! You are the best! Awesome job
History of the entire world I guess
Nah... No thanks.
To think, somewhere above that lava high in the primordial atmosphere early RNA life could be born
Please dont pretend that we know entire history of planet earth. We may know maybe 1% of it.
44:58 Imagine being the organism to invent sex. What a legend.
So many possible Bill Wurtz references/jokes missed…  Still, happy 10th anniversary!
The GOAT
still insane to me that for like 4 billion years, there was nothing but bacteria and other single celled critters vibing in the oceans. 4 BILLION YEARS!!! Makes me think, that if the great filters are a thing, multicellular life is most likely the one. seems like absolute dumb luck that it happened on earth
Wathcing this while you are eating is fire (For my opinon)
the history of the entire world i guess
Kurzgesagt, you've really outdone yourself. Bravo!
these 4.5 billion years are longer than a week.
08:18 You didn't explain critical things like how the first life emerged and where did the water come from?
Holy shit... An hour long video from Kurzgesagt?! Lets fucking go!
I had fun spotting the loops in the beginning , but then I cheated and upped the speed. But seriously where is the Old Guy with a Grey Beard ? PS Snark : Dinos are Dinos NOt Reptiles  OK ??? Where's the old guy ?
started vibing at 3:50, 10/10
Waiting for Spongebob Squarepants characters to show up, as well as Wile E. Coyote and Roadruner.
Humanity a BLINK all that we ever or ever will know only happens every 70 years for most of us. Enjoy your days im 53 years in❤thx guys
Nice music.
This is a Masterpiece
It is crazy to think that the bedrock i'm on top of... is older than the Earths core.. Cratons are weird things.
Damn
So fun!
12:25 The way that puddle just disappeared :P
Can't believe in what am I seeing....
Someone needs to make a LoFi endless loop of this
YES IT HAPPENED
that Mesoarchean beat was sick! never would I ever Imagine myself bangin to Kurzgesagt song.
This was incredible.  I watched it all in one breath without fast forwarding or pausing and... Oh my god.  You guys are amazing.
Another one for continent movement please
OMG AN HOUR LONG VIDEO
Besides learning from this channel when I'm awake, I also use it as my sleep asmr when I'm asleep . I feel so good to help this channel out after going through so many ads within an 8-hour period -- but man, pretty stoked to get even more value. An hour long video with such stunning animation?? You've got to be kidding me. Kurzgesagt 🔛🔝
This video was my literal dream come true. I want to be able to spectate Earth and the universe like this one day. Even though I'll never get to, you guys gave me a snippet of a dream that will never come.  Again, great video! I congratulate and applaud everyone who worked on it and contributed. So amazing
as a grandpa, i can confirm that the way they represented the hadean is fully accurate
Ambient/educational was not a vibe I knew I needed!! This scratches my brain just right
Can someone explain this to me, why are there floating rocks in the beginning of the Rhyacian Period?
Bro...the is...god...this is art...thanks...thanks for this
Not me waiting for bill wirtz reference
This it now my favorite time lapse video.
GIRL YPU DID NOT JUST ANIMATE A 1 HOUR VIDEO HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE
That damn too good 😮
Loved the video. Super amazing looking as always. The music was really good too!
really starting to appreciate the amount of work put into these, between the voiceover and the animation
Takes real integrity to make a video with this type of time scale. Not grab happy instant gratification clickbait but genuinely educational as well as doing economies of scale. Well done!
Respect for the cameraman that had to stay 4543 million years just for a video  Still, amazing video, I never thought I needed this
This comment exists to let the algorithm know that content like this video should be promoted and supported.
Unreal content
Thank you! This video was so nice! It was really soothing, but still educational with the sudden pop-ups of information. The music was great. I really like how the background was moving. It was nice to have a background, firstly because you have something to look at and secondly because it gives a view of how it was/could have been like at that time. But because it was moving, it was constantly changing and therefore it didn't get boring to look at. Also the transitions between backgrounds was good. It was obvious, but not disturbing or something. The artwork is also amazing and at certain times I was genuinely moved. The video gave a really good idea on time on planet earth. I didn't know that multicellular organisms came such a long time after single-celled organisms came into existance. Truly a marvelous video and I would definitely watch a similar one if you make another!
6 minutes in and I am jamming to the soundtrack!!🎉🎉😊
this is a great video
I was following along with wikipedia just to get a few more details in on the periods, and at the end, time was moving too fast to even keep up with the changes.  Just shows how fast life evolved and changed.
Man the Orosirian period kinda slapped.
is this free copy rigth music ?
I have watched the whole thing. I'm feeling emotions I find surprisingly difficult to articulate... a sense of gratitude for being here on Earth, despite all the unfairness and difficulty?
noooo wayyyyyyy
Great music.  A wonderful Journey.  I totally enjoyed it.    Wow!   Time is amazing.
Some people: "I still don't get it"  Kurtzgesagt: "Got an hour?"
AINT NO WAY THEY JUST CASUALLY DROPPED A ONE HOUR LONG VIDEO WITHOUT ANNOUNCING IT ANYWHERE OR ANYTHING
A big shoutout to my boi Bangiomorpha pubescens
44:58 ah yes the sex update
Such a beautiful video I absolutely loved it! Good job <3
This is a masterpiece!!!
Mom let me watch one more video before bed.
Came for the history lesson stayed for the music
This is a work of art.
I really like the Stenian period for no reason whatsoever something about it really resonates with me.
Where did that lava, earth, water and everything come from? Hmm?
beat drops 6 times btw
How do I make this my wallpaper
This was an amazing video! Loved how much of a perspective it gave to history of the planet.
This is the first real work of art in the 21st century.
Personally I liked the book better
youtube : no we can't work with adblock please disable !! kurzgesagt : Here take this one hour passion animated documentary we have been working on for years it's free
The video is just incredible! A mind blower just like "The Egg" for example. The music is just unbelievable good! 58:13 Who smuggled Jeff Goldblum into the video? 😂👍
What an incredible, beautiful video, what an achievement! The music, animation quality and just the guts to go with the concept on a platform that doesn't seem to reward such content, well done and thank you!
The sun is a...
This video is amazing. Though: I can't put my finger on it, but it seems like it's written or voiced by A.I. or something, doesn't it? - at times it feels a bit uncanny-valleyish in tone or script, which is unusual for Kurzgesagt.
music is great, very Jake Chudnow-y
Happy 10 Years Kurzgesagt!   BTW am I the only one here who can't stop thinking of Terraria while listening to this video's music? 😅
I really like this concept
Q & a what’s, the history of the world? Once upon a time we’re on a giant rock floating in space we still are.
Of course the second we get to the human history bit right at the end is when I get a Taco Bell ad.
would've liked a little more commentary :(
i just teared up a bit
18:13 YOOO BILL WURTZ!
omg i love this <3
You know the cameramen get real when they can be anywhere at anytime and are completely immortal.
After watching this, dinosaurs existing seems like yesterday
Kurgezast always fails to dissapoint us :D
Has Greta seen this?
yoooo, the music never misses, this shit goes hard
Hope they build on this over the years. This is such a good format for understanding the scale of time and I would gladly listen to 8 hours of the earth evolving while working!
Поздравляю с 10-летием ваш канал, довольно впечатляющий результат!
Yooo whoever did the music knows what's up
Do we know where the first rain and first cells originated from?
Kursgezagt will forever be a staple in my life and this is my personal thank you to the team. I would be a different, significantly less educated person without you. thank you for everything you have made.
just magical well done... im at work and shouldnt be making this comment on this account shhh🤫🤫
I dont like to do it but I must skip this video
Never thought I’d see a Kurzgesagt lofi music video but here we are.  Really though, this video is insane. I mean an hour of animation? Even a small smooth brained human like me knows that it’s incredible. I have put this in my ‘working’ playlist. Props to everyone at Kurzgesagt and thanks you.
WOOW!!!!
This is..... Amazing. Guys! Wow! Should be in every mandatory in every class around the world
A true masterpiece
45:00 MVP Algae invented sex
legend has it that the Kurgesagt cameras that filmed this are still circumnavigating the earth after 4.5 billion years
this soundtrack is insane
I want to thank everyone from this channel. From the people who clean the offices to the voice of the channel. Beautiful work.
Hell yeah!
me playing genshin with this in the background
There has to be at least some inspiration from the Terarria soundtrack right??? This is so groovy and soothing!
Stunning and life changing.  Thank you so much for making this.
Who let bro cook on the music AND video
my goats did it again
amazing
Bouta learn everything for APUSH in 1 second
19:55 love this shit, sounds like the start of a mf doom level
Amazing!!!
The animation is to good
Wow, it really puts the perspective of how much of the planet's history has been really really simple life, and how modern multicellular life is
I can't believe Kurzgesagt just dropped this masterpiece, no announcement, no trailer or anything, just dropped this massive project that took almost 5 years for free and for anyone to view, well done Kuzgesagt, please keep doing this, please never stop.
You guys have a spectacular art style
the sheer amount of work stuff like this takes... wow. incredible upload
Hi
More importantly, it actually destroys the mystery of how life began, which will be crushingly disappointing to both religious people and mystery lovers. The extraordinary music is mixed especially for smallish devices, and Epic Mountain gets tons of time to develop minimalist themes. I would have gone to a theater to see this (even though it IS just one continuous pan!) so I’m donating $15. Well done.
Almost as good as Star Guitar.
awsome project !!!!!!!
Mr. Thomas Veith and Mr. Fabian Glaser. Thank you so much!  I really enjoyed the music from beginning to end!
You deserve an award. The soundtrack is Grammy worthy.
geez, normally a plate of food is enough to sit through a video. now I'm getting fat
Nothing I can say would be able to express my awe and gratitude for this milestone and everything you've done and shared with us to reach this point so I'll say simply thank you. May you continue to grow and inspire!
Can't wait for part 2!
who watched the entire thing
In just groovin with the universe 🕺🏽
I am not proud of how instantaneously i was excited to see you posted a one hour long video. I really do just gorge myself on content.
This is a beautiful Video 🤩
Shoutout to Stenian bros and sisters!
This is the Earth's Eras tour
26:17 It feels like im in a endless time loop
59:02 - the music, the graphics, the atmosphere and that feathery dino looking at the moon made me shed a tear. The visualisation that some time ago, some being took a look at its surroundings and felt good and even felt some kind of wonder. Truly moving and beautiful.
Just wanna take the time on this journey to thank Bangiomorpha at 45:00 ♡ man well done.
you guys should make WallpaperEngine stuff
wow so cool!!
This 1 hour video feels like forever, both literally and metaphorically. 😂  Although it would be quite interesting to see how future AI will generate this based on “realistic” visuals.
I watched this for 24 hours on loop, after that I decided to call it a day.
When there are no conscious references duration doesn't exist, so it's accurate to say that it actually passed Instantaneously.
Oh how beautiful and simple life was back in the Ediacaran 53:26  Era. 😌
how has nobody pointed out that the music is made like all of the other videos, where its entirely dynamic, BUT FOR THE ENTIRE HOUR, from the bubbly underwater to the dry surface, it all changes along with the video. they realllllly didnt take any shortcuts at all with making this
EPIC
Damn respect to those dinosaurs just standing there for millions of years doing nothing
Oh, I actually teared up at the end. That's us! It took so long for us to get here! Hello!
When you realize that what you usually think as evolutionary history happened in the last few minutes of this video.
Thankyou for putting the scope of this world in such a wonderful easy to digest format. The music is amazing, the visuals were stunning and you truly put into perspective how precious life is and how lucky we are to be here. I have been watching your videos since the beginning and buying merchandise to (selfishly) support you over the years. Thank you, thank you, thank you Kurzgesagt. You are all truly making this world a better place.
And at 3 billion years Nik Nocturnal makes an appearance
This is epic!
Did Kurzgesagt really drop a 1 hour video?! Christmas came early this year.
Fun fact, since every second is 1.5 million years, and this video is 60 fps, every frame is 25000 years
beautiful experience... kudos to all the team, i'm always impressed with the quality of the animation and the complexity in a simple but visually dynamic design... such a great channel. Congrats on 10 years of greatness!
Alternate Title: The history of the entire world, i guess
“And the floor is lava”
Want.the.soundtrack
Giving Bill Wurtz a run for his money, here.
Sad sssniperwolf wasn't banned in this time
stellar video!! Thanks for keeping me company while I work
One of your coolest videos
This is a MASTERPIECE
Thank you! What i love about videos like this is PERSPECTIVE. How many people watching this were shocked to learn that all the interesting animal/plant stuff happens in the last like 7 and a half MINUTES of an hour long video about Earth's history?! Or that the freaking dinosaurs went extinct barely over a minute before the end?! Or that human existence (not recorded history, ENTIRE EVOLUTIONARY EXISTENCE) is barely a second or two?! Even having known this before hand, it's ALWAYS remarkable to see!  I remember when i first learned that the Cambrian Explosion happened LESS THAN half a billion years ago and yet the earth is 4.6 billion old and life is 3.8 (less maybe?), meaning that the appearance of all modern major animal groups happened in less than 1/9th of the time earth has existed!  I remember being confused, like "that seems like a lot of time worth of single-celled nothingness, then all the sudden everything else appears in an instant"! But that was ignorance on my part, because within those billions of years of "nothingness" so many important single-celled milestones happened that, eventually, ALLOWED that explosion of diversity to happen in the Cambrian.   We needed an oxygen rich and temporate climate from photosynthesis, development of bacteria vs archaea vs viruses, MULTIPLE symbiosis events especially for mitochondria and chloroplasts (Eukaryotes), sexual reproduction, predation, cells sticking/cooperating together for multi-cellularism, cell specialization and tissues, among many other things I cant even think of cuz im a layman haha. Not to mention the initial innovations after abiogenesis (lipid cell wall to encapsulate the cell, use of naturally occuring amino acids to make countless kinds of proteins, RNA then DNA to store genetic info, using an energy source for food, and finding a way to reproduce ALL OF THIS for the next generation).  Only AFTER you have all this can a Cambrian Explosion even happen, and these previous steps were all major innovations and thus took TIME and transition (something I foolishly overlooked). The Cambrian Explosion didnt innovate THAT much in a sense (other than animal diversity, but we're animals so we're biased haha). It took advantage of fundamental systems that single-celled life developed over EONS, which in turn allowed the diversity explosion to happen in a relatively short amount of time!  tl;dr: we have a lot of thanks owed to singled celled life working over eons to innovate on life, its what allowed the Cambrian Explosion to happen so swiftly!  Thanks for this amazing video!
Millions not billions?
This should be mandatory lecture for primary school....
The greatest crime is that this video won’t get anywhere near the amount of recognition it should get. Like holy shit the time put into this and so many won’t ever know it exists.
Release a 10 hour version with no voice or music, just background sound effects and youve got a bangin sleep video
really sad that sometimes the narrator says something but nothing visual happens accordingly
YOO so this is what theyve been working on
Shouldn't the first photosynthesizers cause a purple hue? No oxygen and all.
Now do one about Israel
Love the music
Wondering if the music team took any inspiration from the German Metal Collective, "The Ocean" as inspiration for some of the tracks throughout this music video :V (That and the Minimalist Electronic Band: "Brandt, Brauer, and Fricke")
I saw the thumbnail of this video in the corner of my eye, and instantly knew it was a new Kurzgesagt video.
Congrats to Bangiomorpha pubescens, the original CEO of secz.
Awesome project! 👏
4 hours and nearly 500k views wow awesome job guys
I havent even watched the video but i thank you so much for making it!!!
I went to get me a glass of water and when I came back, 500 million years passed.
I believe we have witnessed the birth of a new genre of videos - I can't wait for the dude who AI animates a 4.6 billion year-long 720p video, and tries to upload it on Youtube. Well done guys, this video is amazing -  will you make one with more commentary?
"... and the floor is lava" (around 1:40) 😂😂😂
incredible
Props to the camera man who sat here for 4.5 billion years
So... it took a bit longer than 6 thousand years? Who'd thunk it!
wait holy crap its an hour long?!! this must have taken a lot of effort !
a little too outlandish... more phiilosophical than educational but overall on 2x speed it's ok
This specific combination of narration and music reminds me of Jeff Wayne's musical version of the War of the Worlds. I like it!
Holy shizuoka that was incredible  thank you soooo much for putting this together it really put the timescales into perspective
all the music is an absolute BANGER
People act as if the emergence of eucaryotic cells ins't really that big of a deal, but honestly it's the single most important event in the development of life. It allowed cells to become hundreds of times bigger and infinitely more complex. In comparison, multicellularity was a cake walk and it has happened several times independently.
The edible hit while watching that made my soul float and gave my phone a soul that floated with me and all the time i watched the video
Low-fi beats you have been replaced.
I need 2 more of this kind of videos.  one of just human history.  another ranged from: modern history,  passing on the inside a generational spaceship, and finishing on the arrival of another planet.
Best video on the history of YouTube ever. I have spoken.
63-minute action movie?  Nah, I don't have time for that.  63-minute Kurzgesagt video?  Yes.  So very yes.
This is going to be your best video!
Watched it all. Almost cried.
Beautiful, thanks guys
That was incredible
This is some of the greatest videos I've seen on youtube, in my lifetime.
Who needs a total perspective vortex when there's this
It would be nice to have a version of this video without the voice over. Just to use it as background.
What a journey! And what a banger music too! Hope it becomes available, maybe even in 1h playlist style
The amount of talented people involved in this single video is incredible. Good job!
The Hadean part gives me chills. The music is brisk and prospecting, yet at the same time foreshadowing. While I was listening to it, a concept that I can best describe as "the trumpets of creation" was strongly resonating in my mind. "Awaken, my children, for the journey is ahead of you" calls the planet as its titanic machinery begins to churn.
What type of video is this?
I have some doubts about Ectasian period, 42:22. Acording to official sources,The earth's core started forming roughly about 4.5 billion years ago in the Hadean period, not in the the Ectasian.
Great video Idea, not a fan of the hard transitions between chapters. It pretty much defeats the purpose of making an hour long video.
Holy crap I NEED to watch this high AF this is some Attenborough level of awesomeness!!!!
History of the entire world... I guess!
Lol so fake bs
I am sorry kurzgesagt. I am sure this video take too much time to you, must be very informative, but I will watch stupid movies  instead of this masterpiece. They got me...
Congratulations on your first feature  movie Kurzgesagt! What a bold move and what a reward! And the music is epic! Thank you for the hard work!  Reading the comments, several people appear to have had an existential epiphany. More existential videos like this, please!
Since 2019. Took 4 years to make this video.
I feel like this could be another lofi beats to study to channel. Nice work Kurzgesagt!
The soundtrack is on point!  Kudos to the music/audio director(s).
woahhhhhhhhhhh, amazing!
great video, the only thing I was missing was the temperature on earth
You should make a video on multiverse too!! it is one of my favorite topics I have been watching your videos since your channel creation but you have cover nearly all topics except the one( MULTIVERSE ) related I hope you will cover this topic in one of your future videos.... Once again BRAVO!!!! video....
i got really emotional at the end lol . . .  i can TELL it was loads of work....woould you ever do a history of the universe one?
With other music it could be a very relaxing video to watch before going to bed
"I hope you felt something watching this", bro I literally almost cried at the last part, thank you for your work!
This is UNBELIEVABLE! Keep up the good work Kurzgesagt and congrats on 10 years!
This is great !
And we got this for free
BET
I´m so sorry but music is terrible!
Speechless 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Finally something using a linear scale.
Gotta be one of their best videos of all time! Thanks gang 😘
I've watched entire thing in 1 sitting without breaks... I feel old.
EXCERENTO!
Render glitch? 29:41
❤
Absolutely fantastic! This was so beautiful, the music is awesome, I loved all of it. Everyone who worked on this did an amazing job, so good!! 😍
Amazing ( it took me 13.9 million years to writethat)
वंडरफुल
Blown away by this stunning work of art and science. Can't imagine how much work must've gone into this. Thank you for the last 10 years and here's to many more!
You could give us way more information instead of silent treatment. Fan of your work, but this one is very boring.
entertaining really enjoyed it :)
This was genius.  I bet it will perform spectacularly.
Couldn't watch the whole video like this. Had to watch in 2x speed.
wow
I love how you can just think of new formats. This is what I'd describe as wildly creative ✔️🫶
Took me 4.5b years to enjoy this video.
I like turtles and eucaryotes
This is simply beautiful, thanks Kurzgesagt ❤
Amazing 😍 Thank you!
I had to pause the video for just a moment, and point out that you guys are incredible animators. Really impressive work.
PLEASE release a version of this without the voiceover.  No offense to the narrator.. I think he's great.  But I would love to have a version of this looping on my second monitor with the original music but no voiceover.
This is very helpful to put the history of earth in perspective.
After watching this I became more religious, seeing how Allah created the whole universe and Earth.
I have to say, SPECTACULAR idea and execution!
I've felt...mass effect ? Yeah;, sorry, the music, the landscape... I was wondering where is my Mako♥ Thank you for this wonderful video ! What a journey @_@
No one mentions how lucky we are to receive this content for free
A great video!!!!!
Shout out to the main man Bangiomorpha Pubescens for inventing sex, sounds like a cool dude
If only we had been shown this back in elementary school.  It would have answered so many questions.  Hell, it was informative to me now in my forties!  Really well done.
Should be titled : 4.5 Billion years of speculation in one hour..  Because none of this cannot be taken as fact given theres no records of such events happening.
So you claim the first life was anaerobic?
This is massive, thanks for video ant for your dedication :D
Anyone else ran to jump on a chair when he said "the floor is lava"?...     No? Just me?
i have no assignments left, so this is the perfect video to get on my page rn
Nice Video and congrats for 10 years. I especially liked the fun-facts like the nuclear reactor that happened naturally. ❤🎉
WOW. that is so bytiful artsyle you have made
Sorry,  but half way in,  i decided that there's so much time wasted on repetitive imagery and music,  where more information and images of the single cell organisms or tectonic plates moving etc. Could have been showed,  instead you are left with the correct feeling that it takes a long time... I got that after the first 5 million years already! I don't want to sound like a sour puss but it just is what it is.  Oh and i did make myself watch it to the end,  though this comment is written half way in because i got bored and frustrated.  Only 2.25 billion years to go...
The fact that if humanity goes extinct and theres more intelligent life, they could see this.
This was detailed yet brief and amazing. Please do the same for Human Evolution (paleocene onwards)
53:10 is the time where action happens. Yes, I watched everything before that and after.
Epic Mountain has done it again. What a banger soundtrack.
Really could have used this for my geology exam last year
Just wondering how in the world they made this...
AN HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO?!? What is it, my birthday or something?
2x = 30 min
I didn't know I needed this until I watched it, amazing work Kurzgesagt
This better contain a reference to the sun being a deadly laser
53:41 ANOMALOCARIS MENTIONED
Kurzgesagt: The Movie
this would go crazy on wallpaper engine
When can we get the soundtrack on vinyll? 😉🎶💿
What this isn’t billwarts
do your employees each have a personal birbb
1 strait hr of animation is incredible 👌respect
Disappointed,  15min extended to an hour
Every single tick down on that timer is a thousand ten centuries. A whole century, but ten of them, and then a thousand of those. Truly mind-boggling.
Where is the soundtrack release!?
Big shoutout to the camera guy who survived these billions of years to get us this footage
They took "The floor is lava" quite literally
Respect to cameraman!
How good is this music.
AMAZING
Wow. A korgezagt video that doesnt end up in lfe getting extinct and universe collapsing?.
nice
This is really cool and maybe it was a conscious choice, but as Im leaving the Eorchean, I feel like the video is a little too sparse on information. Im left with questions like why the asteroid showers stopped, whether the solidification of the lava occurred slowly or relatively quickly and in a homogeneous manner, why it started to rain all of a sudden, or even how you pronounce “eoarchean” and what the name represents in a similar manner to “hadean” being from Hades, which is a great mnemonic. Here’s hoping as I continue to watch that a bit more info is provided
Just watched it the whole way through, absolutely amazing. 45:04
The soundtrack for this reminds me so much of the soundtrack from Platinum Arts Sandbox. The nostalgia!
What a beautiful thing! Props!
Is it possible to get a screen saver version of this?!
29:42 oh shit that scared me lmfao
Loved every second of it. Thank you so much for continuing to bring knowledge to the world through amazing videos. Also can I just say how much I appreciate to even see the Finance team included in the credits? Feels incredibly wholesome and covers that feeling of how much you all care. Here is to 10 more years!
The amount of work these guys put into their vids is impressive. Literally do it more justice than actual TV shows
An epic journey! Thank you so much!
For anyone else who really loved the music as much as I did, here's some (instrumental) album recommendations, which I personally love, and have given me the same vibe: - Jean-Michel Jarre - Equinoxe - Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells - Tangerine Dream - Phaedra - Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works 85-92 - Seefeel - Quique - Mogwai - Rave Tapes - Boards of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest - Com Truise - In Decay  Enjoy ❤😊
Mesoarchean Beats to Rip and Tear to
I was strongly vibing to the hadean era track. Certified banger.
You should animate the next 4.5 billion I think the future sounds much more impactful on us than the past in the coming eons.
By far my favourite Kurzgesagt video, love the artwork and the soundtrack is amazing too.
i love the soundtrack, especially 600-300mil
This is possibly the best and coolest video on YouTube 🎉
amazing video. Great work.
WTF happend on 29:43 ?
33:53
this is an great video
Hi, this is amazing. 🎉 Do you have a german version?
Truely humbling to see that the whole human history is just a flash compared to the earth's. Yet we made a huge impact on the planet causing mass extiction and climate change.
Just the soundtrack alone is amazing enough. You guys outdone yourself with this. I hope you huys focus more on this type of stuff.
i see daft punk has returned
Hadean : if the floor is lava, how can it have mountains (see volcanoes) ?
Bro was playing the super mario levels backwards.
19:42 Doom vibes
Now we want the director's cut!
Great stuff, congrats on 10 years
damn, i blinked
Vibing to great beats while watching the earth covered in lava was not something I’d expected to do today, but I love it
WOW WOW WOW WOW thx alot for this Hard and Amazing work <3 this is awsome 4me
O m g, hour long from Kurz??
sick ass beat.
CONGRATULATIONS! and thank you so much! really! For this amazing video. Hope you can work in this amazing project for a very long time!
That was amazing! Watched all the way through enjoying the music and visuals!
That's so trippy that the ground was mostly lava over the whole Earth for 10s or 100s of millions of years. And then it rained constantly for millions of years. Conditions can always be much worse than they ever are now on our planet.
Thank you so much for this absolutely wonderful video, animations and everything❤️ The whole team is astounding! You guys are so Amazing!!! Keep up the absolutely smashing work💪 I am pretty certain I can say that your whole community loves the content, you and we even learn something!!!
Never have I thought that the day I could watch 1 straight hour of a Kurzgesagt video without pressing the replay button a kurgzillion amount of times would be so soon let alone ever.
omg this is amazing
It took me about 1 billion years to eat my lunch
29:43 The very fabric of our shallow simulation we called home starts to tear
This is a freaking MASTERPIECE! ❤
Is this playlist online somewhere?
I'm here for the silly begining .. what a joke
I never realised it took so long for multicellular life to grow beyond the microbe level. Whilst watching this it made me think that if we compressed the earth's history into 80 years, multi cellular wouldn't appear until earth turns 70. After most people retire. That's crazy
This is a vibe for sure.
Please make this into a vr simulation
Not even out of the Hadean and the music is already grating.
Thank you for this epic journey. The soundtrack is awesome!!
The soundtracks are FIRE  And this is very good for learning about the earth
58:08 WAIT, do I have a dirty mind, or was that a joke about "vögeln"? Sneaky germans
love the music, should relece it as "Lo-Fi beats to time travel to"
53:45 ANOMALOCARIS SPOTTED RHAAAAAAAAAA 🗣️💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Love your videos ! But 1 hour was much too long for the amount of informations given
This was the best slow tv I have ever seen:)
This is so cool! Love it
44:55  In the Stenian, not much is going on Except the algae might have invented sex, a very big improvement  💀💀(I just found that funny)
Perfection. Thank you.
Felt like I was playing Terraria
And the star Betelgeuse is only around 10 million years old and is already  dying
how do we know all this stuff?
58:50 crescent moon is lit from the wrong side. Oops.
Thank you for all ❤
The most badass video I have ever seen! 🧡
1 hours of Kurzgesagt? This is a Christmas gift
45:00 is the best part of history
Amazing video. Congratulations!
No way...
What a beatiful hour this was. I was able to forget so many things in the world happening now so I could see back into a cognitive immeasurable amount of time and watch how it all started. Thanks so much Kurzgesagt, it was a trip like no other.
Hey that's a langgesagt
No longer Kurz, you are now langegesagt.
Wild
This is amazing. Thank you.
AMAZING!
World may be burning down but kurzgesagt uploading a 1 hour of masterpiece is enough to save it
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. (All before the video) God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.” So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above (8:36-12:36). And it was so. God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so (18:35-34:47). God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so (17:59-27:47). The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night, and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years. And let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so. God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night (0:43). And He made the stars as well. God set these lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth, to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves (53:35), with which the waters teemed according to their kinds, and every bird of flight after its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so (55:38). God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself and every creature that crawls upon it.” So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them (1:00:39). God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.” Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food. And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
As an alien I better watch this before my earth history exam
I love that there is a version like this with occasional explanations but it would be fun to also have a version with no speaking for putting up in the background for the music and ambient sound while working
atheist after a one hour video: No
So Earth has changed so much and so many times without humans. But the climate change / Global Warming / Global cooling / Global BOILING!
The concept for this video isn't very well-thought-out.
Was just thinking about you and you posted :3
This is absolutely beautiful. Amazing how life has evolved over hundreds of millions of years. In my opinion water is absolutely incredible for life. If you think about it, over the eras, you had several times that the whole earth was under a thick snow. But life endured, because this incredible liquid has a higher density at 4 degrees rather than 0 degrees and so life can continue existing below the ice. Absolutely magical. I wish they also had mentioned when mitochondria "was added" to the cells. Cheers Kurzgesakt.
When you realize that an entire human lifetime (80 years) is only 0.0053% of each second, or 53 nanoseconds...
Thank you so much ❤
You should make a version without the timeline in the corner, just the artwork
can we have an version of it without the narrator? like with just the music and sound effect !!
This was awesome! Loved it a ton.
Superb!  Simply superb.
Environmentalist: "The planet is dying! We need to save it!" Me: "Meh, give the planet a few million years (aka a few extra seconds of this video) and it will be fine. The real concern is how humanity have managed to survive this far."
Yep that's how God showed it to Moses.
I was confused why nothing of modern times even showed up, then calculated it out and realized all of human history lasts less than half of a single frame (at 60fps).  That’s insane.
no fucking way I had to double check it was actually kurzgesagt
Came for the video, stayed for the music
this video took more than 1 second to make
disliked. wouldve appreciated it if you included subway surfers gameplay just as a reference for the scale of time or something idk
This is the Kurzgesagt I live for. This was amazing, and I honestly felt emotion watching this. I hope you guys continue to make amazing things.
Where’d the water come from?
Perfect falling asleep material.
Props to all the animators for the amount of time and effort put into this. I learned a lot from this video and will continue to learn more thanks to Kurgesagt.
Mad props to the camera man for recording all of this 👨📸
Beautiful video idea, love the artwork, I'm gonna have this playing on the TV in the background when I have people over
I can’t imagine how hard it was to do it. Thanks so much everyone who helped this video to get on YouTube!
Me va a dar un infarto el dia que vea este video en español 😍
I couldn't look away honestly. The music and the visuals are so well executed!
SEX invented here 45:02

Thank you Kurzgesagt for this 1h (!!!!!!!!) video!!!
i watched and loved every minute of this vid ❤
This thing is waaaaaay better with the help of a joint
he think he bill wurts
Its just... so perfect, you deserve my like
The only thing i can call this is a Masterpiece all the details the music and the vibes are just perfekt thanks for making my day
The last second would have deserved a 10,000 fps slow motion ;)
Impressive work!
"You can have this in the background, study with it, or just enjoy the ride."  As if I'll miss a single frame of this.
Thanks, Bangiomorpha pubescens!
when he said "the ancestors of the birds... do.. bird things." i really felt that
This is epic. An hour long Kurzgesagt video is a gift! Thank you
This music is SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD!!! Would definitely pay for it!
Love this. Congratulations on finishing it.
There's very few videos executed with this level of clarity, intent, beauty, perspective, and polish in existence. This is a masterclass video, immediately timeless.
The music has no right to go this hard
Please tell me you guys will do the whole history of the universe in this style as well.
Longest kurgzgart video by a long shot to
The Y.E.C. Version of this is 0.004seconds long. 😂
Honestly this was rather underwhelming. You could have done a lot more with this, especially on the illustration side.
29:40 found a small glitch in the animation that must of slipped by
Its really that you can see how the chapters of the video get shorter and shorter throughout the video
Amacing video! Ps.: There is one wierd frame in 29:43
I think people would be willing to die to get a hold of those backgrounds to set them as a video wallpaper or something. This looks marvelous. Wow.
Thank you so much for this, team Kurzgesagt! ❤❤❤ Happy 10th anniversary! Here's to many more years! 😊
E
Imagine watching this masterpiece and just suddenly being interrupted by an ad. Nitpicks aside, 10/10 video of time with fire, dope, chill, peak fiction soundtrack.
Camera man got Gods phone number.
wow time to look for the Pkm references
I loved this one - thank you for making it available to everyone, your labor of love does not go unrecognized or unappreciated ❤
44:50 is my favorite sentence right now
Awesome video! Now we need another 1 hr video on the the current age, Neoprene with an emphasis on Human Evolution. That will be truly amazing!
The history of the world I guess just got one upped
A new level of educational content is unlocked. Congrats to all humanity👏👏.
“The History of the World, I Guess: The Movie”
The cameraman be like:
Great video but can we talk about how good the soundtrack is????
What a beautiful video ❤
omg this should be on wallpaper engine
WOW, JUST WOW. THANK YOU FOR THIS CONTENT!  I will support you guys when i will get my next salary
Got to be in the running for best YouTube video of all time.
This is incredible, Thank you!
Best video of 2023
But where is god in all of this 😉
God be like: "Ah sorry, I was listening to this bop music and zoned out. Wait what do you mean 4.5 billion years just passed?"
45:04 pog!? :0
Is this a compilation of dozends of old videos or is it all new?
This is the longest and fastest timelapse ever
Hadean : everything is lava, fireballs dropping from sky, God blasting synthwave music
this must have taken a least a year to create and not even including the amount to time to edit. Props to the great animation!
I appreciate it very much. It's gigentic work!!!!!
As a rule, anyone who is watching this video cannot skip any Ads and must comment at least once to show appreciation to the whole team.
Youre a gift from heavens thank you
what a wonderful animation <3
I have this playing in the background as I deliver amazon packages, the music is pumpim and the lore is poppin
That banger of a song
I bet that was a pain to animate 😂😂😂😂  Great Video!
ITS A MOVIEE
Science but make it art 👌🏻
I nerd a 'much hot and comfy' mug
44:51 We did it boys.  We found the CEO of sex
I love these parts 45:00 59:37
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. He sent his one and only son Jesus Christ to live and die for our sins. Therefore when we die we may live with him for all of eternity. Amen.
Earth lore
Where did the water that raised come from?
Such a privilege to be alive at this point in time where one can enjoy such masterpieces by sharing one's limited time of existence with the Kurzgesagt team 😍
I still have so many questions: How did the earth when it was a ball of fire form? Where did all the water come from when it began to rain?
Thank you 🎉 is all what I can say, with ❤ from Vietnam
Would absolutely love to have these visuals and music as an option for Tetris Effect just to have more ways of enjoying this beautiful piece of art
I was just studying and then I heard “then animals finally invented s*x” and then I chocked
This is like a perfect 4am DJ set... call it Partial life cycle of earch.
this is some bill wurtz level shit
Watching this made me remind of an old game from EA - Spore, it was fun to play
55:45 "This land thing is something they need to try out." NO. THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER.
Hats off for u
Very cool idea for a video, glad to see you are still trying to experiment and try new things!
I love it❤
So amazing.thank you
my friend added this to his sex playlist???????
Amazing just beautiful
This was so good 😊
I got the see the day when Kuzgesagt uploads a 1 hour vid!😱 I can die in peace now😇
3h
A wonderful video. Would love to see something similar about our solar system, the initial positions of the planets, formations/captures of moons and such.
they could have been much more informative, there's plenty of things to say for every period. also, it would have been useful to get glimpses of the continental drifts. i like this channel, i've even bought merch, but this was a waste of a production, it could have been more useful to us all.
Congrats ! It's beautiful 🥲
Has to be the best kurzgesagt  of my life
This is so insane - 1 hour long !!
Upload a version with no narration so some of us can just play it in the background and study to the music/ visuals. Plus would provide you guys with extra ad revenue and views :)  Win win for everyone
Tomorrow is my birthday and no one remembers it Im claiming this as my birthday gift
Amazing video, really put life and our planet into perspective! One of my favourite videos you’ve done!
this is amazing!!
The mind-numbing music and boring visuals ... couldnt watch this to the end.
Hadean period was full of lava and sweet jams
Dude, this is trance-y and amazing!
I did feel something, love for this channel! Great job :)
I love you guys. Huge respect!! PS. I loved watching it second time, when I knew how long we have been here :D Nice perspective.
There's something special here. Kurzgesagt delivers yet again!
WHAT!?
Ahh, I blinked at the end. Gotta watch it all again now.
kurzgesagt freaked out and made a hour-long video💀
I enjoyed this, which I like
Truly amazing
God this is so beautiful. Thank you Kurzgesagt for putting such a beautiful, educational, inspiring piece of art out in the world.
I will so hardly use this to fall asleep. Or the algorithm will let me wake up to this in the middle of the night. I'm curious how long it takes for the first comment of people to wake up to this video. THANK YOU! Amazing work!
The music, the sound effects, the hypnotic animation and the occasional bit of narration, just... perfection 👌
In my first minute already loving it <3 <3 . Gut gemacht <3
Fascinating the whole of human existence is about 0.2 second in this 1 hour video
You guys make movies now, im all for it. But seriously this must have taken forever to make. This Channel is a gift
16:51 Nice Star Wars reference
This was absolutely stunning, one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. Fantastic job Kurzgesagt.
Shoutout to the Cameraman for this BANGER!!💯🔥🔥🫡
Its kind if fun to think about how the matter that made up the Hadean era of the Earth, is in us today 💕✨
Hellllooo
I recommend the band The Ocean.  They take this concept of the different time periods of earth and wrote music to it.  And outstunning masterpiece you´ve created again Kurzgesagt! The music and the animations are phenomenal!
This is Kurzgesagt's magnum opus.
The music feels like I am playing some Pokemon Mystery Dungeon!
wow! now i only have to watch this 3.942 × 10^13 more times to really know what 4.5 billion years feels like!
44:55 That algae is a real one, literally the CEO
There’s little glitches like 29:44 but an amazing feat to make it scale correctly. Love the music.
incredible!! the work from 2019 clearly paid off :)
Just when you think Kurzgesagt can't overdo themselves, they do. Brilliant vid: fantastic music, beautiful visuals, a work of art as always. Thank you! 👍
can't believe this video was made billion years ago
Bill Wurtz, finally, outdone..?
Sorry, “Life On Our Planet” got there first! 😂 joking
BRAVO!  this video is a WOW!!!!  🤩🤯❤🧡💛💚💙💜
THIS IS A GOATED VIDEO
Imagine a drummer that is playing that beat. Every second he hits the drum. One second is one Million Years, the video is one hour long. Lets suppose the drummer needs to move his hand 1 Meter from one beat to the next. 1 hour in 1 Million years is the 0,000000000114th part of it. That means, as you watched the video, the drummer moved his hand 114 Picometer on his swing for his next million year drum beat. 114 Picometer are just barely enough to be registered by an electron microscope or roughly 4 hydrogen atoms in width.
Crazy how you compiled 4.5 billlion years into 1 hour, I wonder how much content was missed
I want to put this in a frame!  Can you give us a making-of, please? How do you animate an hour long pan? Procedural vector engine? Generative AI? Elbow grease 😱? All three possibilities are super impressive.
Now that's just amazing! Thanks to the whole team. And gratz with 10 years anniversary!
bill wurtz did it in 19 minutes and 26 seconds
love that you played Tool-like music in Tonian. Clap
The moon should have looked a lot bigger in the sky during the first 3 billion years because it was much closer to earth back then.
I can't believe we're blessed with a 1 hour Kurzgesagt video.
Full length movie
Crazy how this isn’t even close to the age of the universe itself
the art work in this video was so nice
BABE WAKE UP KURZEGASGT POSTED
Rarely do I comment but this is perhaps the best exception to that rule: thank you so much for this. This is absolutely amazing, between the musical score, the imagery, the representation of eons, and the amazing way the information is interspersed, I'm blown away!
Awesome work guys as always this infotainment is of great class and not to mention massively educational...kept my kids hooked for an hour :) and I feel they learned something as opposed to most of the world content offers today. Thanks for the passion you guys have. keep up the great work.
lol, rocks glitch at 29:40
wow for hour...tanx man
Who ever made the music is a big Tool fan, and I'm loving it.
In Earth's history, humans really are just a jumpscare. For now.
I legit cried.
Holy shit… this is incredible
let them COOK🔥🔥🔥
Imagine walking through this in VR or something
It feels illegal to watch this for free.
Loved this. Happy anniversary!
this whole thing is amazing! although it could be half the length, I'm sure you are smart enough to realise how.
been waiting since 2019 for this. and i have to say. Its perfect.
Closest I’ve caught an In a Nutshell video to release.  What a time to be alive.
Watched ever second of this video gang  👇
this is a cool changeup to the regular content. the music goes hard
God almighty the soundtrack is glorious. 😍
Bro really slept on the Ordovician. 54:17 not a word, really shamefully ignorant, I have friends from who grew up during that time and it's such a failure he did not even cover all the exciting things.
That was so calming and serene. I loved it.
Absolutely amazing
One hour goes by quickly...
Woooohoo 🍺🗿
In an ideal world, this video would be the most viewed video on You tube.
the credits are too long, took me 350M years to go over everyone
Question: Did Earth always have a magnetic field?
Perfect "movie" wish you could do more of these.
finally i found something to watch while tripping
The songs are lowkey bangers
Anyone still waiting for that asteroid 2.5 billion years ago
Big bang theory intro: extended edition
I'm sooo looking forward to the extended version of this video on the 14 billion years that the universe has existed 😍
I always wondered why the ages closer to modern day are shorter. is it because things continued to speed up and changes are happening faster? Or is it simply humans can see things that happened closer to modern day easier and can better divide up the ages?
Uhhh... history of the entire world I guess.
I know how MASSIVE projects like this must be, but a version of this for the solar system as a whole, or going through the terraforming stuff for other planets that you've done already would be so amazing. I loved every second of this video.
the music reminded me so much of Tool's Fear Inoculum album, like an ambient version.
I live for this kind of simple masterpieces, no plot, quite a bit of knowledge, but that's not the focus here Just pure, unfiltered talent Animation, soundtrack and sound effects that puts you on a experience, a pleasant one I love this, thank you, everyone who worked on this, you are amazing ❤
That was a fantastic trip through Earth's history. Gotta say though, the midrolls really screwed pacing. Especially the one that drops at the end. "Don't blink or you'll miss it." and then an ad literally starts in that second.
This really feels like melody sheep
Beautiful video, it really puts the age of our planet into perspective.
Damn
Proof the camera man NEVER dies.
Thank you for this masterpiece
Eh - I like fictitious worlds better.
45:02 Shout out to "alga bangiomorpha pubescens" that invented sex
An hour long Kurtsgesaght
An hour long Kurtsgesaght
An hour long Kurtsgesaght
I definitively felt something. Thank you.
This is a masterpiece, years well spent
Before i dedicated 1 hr of my life to this video, is this just multiple videos previously made in one video or a brand new video?
This video kept the time constancy while showing us a beautiful animation for free. It's a masterpiece.
Can anyone explain why the sun got darker during the Hadean phase
The quality here is amazing 👏 props to everyone on the kurgesaght team
You just were God for an hour.
I just got my Calender and posters for 2024 ^.^ so happy. thank you guys!!
Thank you for literally changing lives by inspiring people to love science. I'm very glad to be lucky enough to have lived in these last 0.000013 seconds and to have kurtzgezat around for the last 0.000008 seconds of the earth's history.
gotta hve some shrooms or lsd for maximum efficiency watching this
Also, the tune was on point compliments to the artists.
Have not seen it yet but I already know this is going to be an amazing video 😁
Technically. It took them over 4.5 billion years to make this video.
45:03 I'm waiting these guys to release sex 2, been a long awaited release
The evolved form of “The Entire History of the World I Guess”. “The Entire History of the World I Know”
The ultimate attention span test
@8:40 "rains for millions of years" or as we call it in the UK - summer.
Fantastic
imagine how the planet would look like if there never was any kind of extinction event :O
Put this video in a loop, and you can replace that fireplace video during Christmas
Ive never been so excited to see a sponge in my life
A minute of silence for those who "dont believe in Evolution" 🤔🙄🤐
At 8:30, It begins to rain? Where did the rain come from? Isn't rainwater water that has condensed from the evaporation of water on the earth's surface? Even if there was some water from the surface, it would be a finite amount.
This would be much better without the youtube adds.
this is an amazing video i know it before even watching
Not impressed
man i am sorry for the editors
didnt vsauce do that at the end of one of their videos?
omg this is so detailed!
Officially the biggest shortcut in history of Earth 😂. Joke aside, incredible job, thanks so much for this quality content
thats too hard, I prefer magic, this is a video game created by other human gods
Amazing Job. That was Perfect 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
that was brilliant
such a masterpiece loved every second :D
The soundtrack slapped.
BRUH THANKS
This was amazing. Would love to see the last 1 million years in 1 Hour.
Honestly, thank you so much for all the knowledge you guys provide us.
You're spoiling us KURZGESAGT
bill wurts did it in less then 3 mins
and still none of us can grasp the time that has past even close...
❤
sooo coool! love everything about it!❤
Really cool and insightful. Really amazing ❤
Took a break at 29:30
holy shit
Kurtzgesagt continues to blow me away with just how much passion and care they put into each and every project they pursue. It is genuinely awe inspiring that we receive this for free and, it inspires me to pursue my own projects with the same fervor and passion.
This kicks ass
Amazing 🤩
The animation is absolutely amazing, but the music is a total bop as well!!!
1 hour video, 4.5 billion years, i dont want to imagine how long this video took you guys. Thank you so much for the effort! ❤
Sooo good. Thank you.
Is the music available as a download?
So, questions... 1. Between the first and second periods, how did it go from raining fire to raining, well, rain? And was it more like acid rain because the atmosphere was so greenhouse gassy? Did things just cool down enough for that to happen? If so, how?  2. You talk early on, in the section where it's still raining fire but starting to rain rain, about the ingredients  for life potentially being present. Does that indicate that the ingredients came in on the meteors? Like we're all "aliens", so to speak, since what initially made up everything didn't originate here?  3. Earth used to spin faster? How did it slow down? I thought gravity was a constant? I mean, I ASSUME that's at least part of what keeps it in rotation, but I could be mistaken.  4. I know that, in the early stages, we're not talking daisies and tigers and humans, but how did even prehistoric life sustain itself under such hostile conditions? Do we know?  5. Wait, what? How did the bacteria produce oxygen if...there...was no oxygen...? Now I'm confused. THIS is how much you don't learn in Catholic school science, good Gods.  6. How many Ice Ages were there/ Because we are NOT talking the one that ended 12,000-ish years ago that split Asia off from North America. That whole theory about the Indigenous crossing the land bridge is BS, by the way. They've been here (I'm Canadian) WAY longer than that. Try about 100,000 years, which is how their genomes have diversified so much from anyone in Asia. Those sorts of differences couldn't evolve in just 12,000 years.  7. How did life survive the second really big Ice Age? Since it wasn't multicellular yet, and didn't need to breathe, though it did still need oxygen, I wonder if the survivors of the initial freeze didn't go underwater and hang out and reproduce under the ice sheet for a few thousand years? That's my best guess.  8. Potentially stupid question, but when did the day-night cycle start? I mean visibly? I assume that was after the atmosphere formed and the sky turned blue, but I'm not sure.  9. Uh, YEAH, I'm willing to believe this one took forever. Happy anniversary!
This must have taken years. Thank you for this ❤
7:20 "it's still much hot"
Thank you so much for this amazing piece of art, history and education. To see "recognizable" life past the 50min markis astonishg haha
They just keep on making better and better videos its insane
👏👏👏
Omg this is such a fantastic video it's one of my favourites ever you really get to understand and feel it so much it was so fantastic ❤
The music SLAPS at 1.5x, I’m at 45 mins in and this bass has me vibing.
This is the coolest thing on yt
bill wurtz did it better
An hour long Kurzgesagt video to round off Friday? Sign me up!
I can’t believe that I got to see an hour of kurzgesagt.
The soundtrack is amazing!
just vibing to the music is very much hype * hypervibing *
45:00 - SEX WAS INVENTED
Crazy. At this scale you don’t even have time to say “humankind” for all the time we’ve existed.
We need to give credit to the production crew... this was awsome
800 million years ago - The first pepperoni pizza materializes from a puddle
The floor is lava. hahaha
Stellar animation aside, the soundtrack for this is a BOP!
What a masterpiece, it is an hour-long educational video, with minimal ads and music that fills the vibe beautifully. props to the Kurzgesagt team for putting in such a tremendous effort in not just this video, but to all the last ten years of dedication to creating free videos for the masses to watch.  One hour of music is one task, and one hour of animations and Narrating is truly out of this world. And it is quality work too! I can't even imagine the time it took to create this video. Weeks!? MONTHS?! Truly Spectacular.
Music just sucks. It’s important for such a long video and a pity they made it as a “whatever” thing.
You have to put this in textbooks.
I still don't get it, if photosynthesis was I don't know, invented by bacteria far away from the origins of life, what did the origin bacterias ate to stay alive, I mean where did they got their energy from, if photosynthesis was a thing way after the origins of life itself.
Credits taking more screen time than human race. Just kidding :D :D ... great work as usual.  People tend to forget how puny humans really are.
Usually history of earth is told like "Earth was molten. And then bacteria, and then multicellular life!"  Never realized it was more just.... subjective eternity dominated by nothing but bacteria and single-celled organisms. And how long it took for the nucleus to appear - is simple life more likely to spontaneously appear than nuclei?
Without any exageration, this should be shown in every school around the world. Absolutely briliant.
I just watched the whole thing while doing some things on the side and I must say, the animation is absolutely stunning. Huge props to everyone involved!
Who else watched the whole video?
1 hour kurzgesagt episode??? History is being made!
7:22 I dont think that 'much hot' is grammatically correct, great video though
Congratulations Kurzgesagt on 10 YEARS 🎉 Thank you for everything you guys do for your community. We all love you ❤
Damn. Your teatching more than school taught me in a month!🙄
Thank gosh for the plus 15 second button.
Amazing work! What a masterpiece. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
Sorry to sat but The editeres have been lazy on this one  One farme evrey 5208 years do better next time
this should be in theatres imo
I love the music
Bro’s videos are always so good
Your videos look fantastic on Phillips Ambilight TV. Rear RGB lights produce great light show on these videos 👏🏻
I never leave comments, but this deserves it more than anything. Thank you.
I'm going to sleep 💤 3 times 😅
After seeing this video I can tell this is the best channel in the history of earth.
just found my new go to study video
Probably the best video on YouTube 2023. Thank you
Thank you!
This was the first deep time video that really hit home. Amazing!
"A big reproductive improvement, for many different reasons." lol
"1.2 Bilion years ago in the Stenian not that much is going on. Except, the algae Bangiomorpha pubescens might have invented sex."  Caught me off guard for a second there
Watching in 10x speed, missed the tiny puny human
W
Common "cameraman never dies."
Fewer reused assets than MW3 10/10
How do we know that the music people at Kurzgesagt didn't just have an hour long jam session and the others just went "lets put some visuals over this"
This video, is a rollercoaster of emotions. The first half hour, i was in a state of calm and wonder, trying to make sense in my head how little happen in so so much time. The second half hour, after the Cambrian explosion, i started crying, realizing that... we are... kinda nothing to the planet in a geological time. It's so impressive to see it on this perspective. I really love this. Thanks Kurzgesagt for ALL you have done through this years.
I hope you have a second YouTube channel where you just post the video and the soundtrack.
Idea: post this video but without the voiceovers, intro, or outro. A 10/10 Kurz study track
Gosh, it took life SO LONG to really start, and now in like 20minutes if I follow the time scale of this video, the sun will end us all T___T what a waste
Amazing work! Can't wait for the 10 hour version for your 100 year anniversary
What a time to have mushrooms
Fortunately I had the time to do the whole trip of this video while in bed because of covid! 😅 Thanks for such an amazing work and soundtrack!
This has to be a screensaver.
Watching this makes me happy that i was born now rather than a single cell on a wasteland
Anyone else getting high while watching this?
The reason(s) for cooling of earth at the end of siderian should have been mentioned. 30:17
The Eoarrchean period id my favourite because of the rain sounds
this video is life itself
Freaked out how early we think life began
1 hour long Kurzgesagt video? Is this real? 😮🎉
I've had astroscience put into perspective before, but nothing quite hits as a solid hour where every SECOND is 1.5 MILLION years 😮
12:8 lightning z depth weird glitch
I'm ascending this could not get any better
Got really stoned and vibed to cool music, animation and narration for an hour.  Luv u Kurzgesagt ❤
OK but how did we come to the conclusion of the different periods? Based on what? XD did someone travel 4.5b back to the past?
i need a version of this without the talking so i can put it on loop to sleep to
Plz upload a real time version. I blinked 😢
🔥
glitch at 29:43
Looking forward to the young earth creationist response to this. eating_popcorn.gif
do a video in AI risks!
would definitely have one of these eons as an animated desktop background !
Congratulations to everyone who is part of this team for so many years, after watching all your content I feel fortunate to be alive in this blink of an eye where Kurzgesagt exists
BAŞKAN ÇIKARIP MASAYA VURMUŞSUNUZ HELAL
Oooooooooh my God!!! 1 hour!
History of the earth: 99% Nothing then 1% Everything
10:35 What with the asteroids?
This is such an amazing experience. Huge thanks to everyone involved 🙏 🙌
I got hooked onto this vid by the 3rd minute
Laid down in my bean bag, 3/4 minutes had passed, decided that the music is so good I might as well play a game. 1h later the game still asks for my login credentials... Awesome soundtrack and visuals!
Damm kurzgesagt, you didn't have to hit this hard with that music❤❤❤
Who were the idiots that disliked this amazing video?
what a ride
ok but the music is amazing
Oooo, someone’s been watching Melodysheep! ;)  EDIT: I’m not sure what I was expecting from this video, but a sick Hadean beat drop was not it! Not that I’m complaining, of course…
I’ve been watching kurzgesagt videos since the age of 10 and I am now in college. These never fail to amaze me! Honestly without your videos I probably would’ve never gotten into science and Astronomy. Thank you for your work and dedication!
45:00 what was invented?
Kurzgesagt is my Favourite YT Channel out there. There detail about our planet and species blows my mind away. im 3 hours early this got uploaded
im boppin to the music
Godness me, it's amazing
Not sure where you getting this nonsense, But it took God a Week to create Earth and everything on it
This really puts time and billions of years into perspective. Amazing job! Thank you for making this!
I feel like this somewhat explains the absence of aliens-- Life is mainly invisible single-cells.
PLEASE do more long-form content like this. Especially stuff that isn't very information-dense. Many of us want something cozy to watch/relax to. Amazing job!
So glad I didn’t live 3 billion years ago. By then, the ads took several million years to pass.
This is amazing! thank you
great vid good music too
That video was awesome. The amount of time that Earth was uninhabitable is unbelievable, and the tiny sliver of time that life has existed is humbling. Excellent work!!
best kurzg yet? yup.
Wow   This took from 2019 to 2023
God I love the music.
Love the music! It sounds like Nora En Pure and I am SO HERE FOR IT!
"good job if you're still watching, you've watched a billion years so far" 😏Meanwhile definitely not me with 2x speed and mashing the ➡button.
Love it but you could have shown us the asteroid impacts and tectonic plates shifting etc instead of just a scrolling background which isnt showing us anything at all 🤷🏻‍♂️
Amazing efforts for passing on knowledge in simple format 🎉
Best education channel on yt
Thank you to the algae for inventing sex
The OG bird crew setting an incredible pacing in this one 💙
Very nice content! Keep going!
This is amazing!!!
omg sameee
58:12 "Live ... ähh ... finds a way." - perfection
Thank you for this incredibile video! It's an interesting and original idea to help to understand the geological time... and how short is the human era. 😅 Great Greetings from Italy!
Its the hole fucking history of the earth by Kurzgesagt yes man yesssss
Would it be possible to get a version with no words or music, just the ambient noises?  Thanks much and we’ll done!
Holy crap I love it
Insanely interesting video! The music was absolutely fantastic throughout the entire thing and the animations gorgeous🐦
3:03 Me just vibing to the music
Banger?
Truly amazing. What an inspired way to teach this!
no way kurzgesagt is copying bill wurtz
I'm very happy with this. Thank you and good day.
as a musician i really appreciate all the effort that was put into music and sound design for this video! tremendous work!!!
Give an ocasr to the editor they did an good job
Watched the whole thing, no skips, normal speed
Props to the cameraman that recorded all 4.5 BILLION years to make this awesome video.
Some parts of the video feels a lot like minecraft. hehe
my god, I never expected them to release what's basically a movie compared to their normal format, but it's so much in their style and its all amazing
Time flies when you’re having fun
Why isn't this in a podcast in Spotify?
Kinda weird how life emerged relatively quickly after it became habitable in some areas
Awesome!
Team Mammals!
I think the earth is only 4.49 billion years old, 4.5 billion is just ludicrous and not realistic....
From where comes the water that fills the oceans with water at the eoarchean phase?
One hour ago, I was a boy, now I'm a man.
good working music
Masterpiece  , good job guys , we are so proud and we will continue to support you <3
Eorchean must’ve been a great time for people who sleep with rain sounds.
You guys are incredible. Evidently self sacrifice for the betterment of humanity is a core pillar to your programming. Much love from fellow nerds
very nice!
I think I'll watch this to fall asleep xD
holy shit
This is always such a cool thought experiment thank you so much for sharing this with the world 🌍
Prop to the railway Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuused by the cameraman
I love the doom soundtrack at the Mesoarchean period
first forms of life: good soup 👍
Somehow I am nostalgic thinking of Hanna Barbera.
Why is Kurzegesagt shocking us each time with some level of quality content that we previously thought was impossible to achieve AND FOR FREE !!!!!!!
I clicked so fast on this shit
Wait i am at ‏‪45:25‬‏  and i have seen ZERO ads do you not get any sd revune becuse that tuf man  Edit: i watch evry 1M years of the vid and no ads
That was a long one.
I love this, thank you so much!
this music reminds me of Cosmoteer's music
45:00 - *The Sex Update!*
A HOUR KURZGESAGT VIDEO???
I feel tiny
Oh yeah, not much going on in the stenian... aside from, you know... INVENTING SEX!?!
It is a modern tragedy that many people still don't believe this is true, based on their own narrow-minded beliefs.
I am speechless. What a video. Excellent soundtrack as well. Very well done and Thank you!
This is absolutely mind blowing! The fact that I can watch this whenever I want, wherever I want FOR FREE, is a blessing beyond compare. Thank you Kurzgesagt for all you do, teach, and share 🧡
Thank you to meshuggah for providing the soundtrack for mesoarchean era
Damn, I blinked at the end. 😂
i was excited seeing an hour long video but it turns out to just be music with the narrator saying a few words every minute
55:46 there it is! There's the fucker, hundreds of millions of years ago he thought that land was "something to try out" and now I've gotta pay taxes because of him smh
I don't think I've seen anything more METAL than this Kurzgesagt video during the Mesoarchean section after the narrator says "You would basically die immediately in this atmoshpere." and the music enters an insane prog metal run with a funky bass line, sneaky double kick drum, and moody synths 🤘
this is by far one of the best videos I've ever seen on Youtube.
What an effort! Congratulations, Kurzgesagt! You made my day happy
All the short attention spanned kids clicked off
?!?!?
This is incredible
Thank you Kurzgesagt for giving all this quality content ❤
made it too unnecessarily long
any dislikes are christians
this was very good!
Damn animating a 1 hour video?
bill wurtz reference!!!
We evolvin' with this one boys
WOW!!! Incredible work! Congratulations and thank you for all the effort 👏
The mix of music and visuals in this video are perfect.
This video was STUNNING! WOW so cool, I’ve been waiting all my life to see a Timelapse of the earth like this. Thank you for making this wonderful piece of art!
I'd like to send a shout out to my homies algi in the Stenian period for inventing sex, great move you guys.
Can't wait for all the reaction channels to react to this.
1 billion years to make this
59:45 damn 💀
When I got to the video it has been already uploaded for 13.5 billion years.
i’m in this video
The sun is a deadly laser!
What a cool idea. Thanks for creating and sharing it
I watched a 45million year ad somewhere in there
Props to perspective. That was awesome
I liked the part where the thing happened
Big thanks to you guys, you did a great job! I wish you strength and passion to do more cool video like this, it feels incredible to learn something new about our world everyday ❤
Use a music playlist when doing homework:❎ Use Kurzgesagt playlist when doing homework: ✅
Pleeeaseee!  Dublem esse video para o Português-BR! Esse vídeo merece ser passado nas escolas!
Amazing
Shoutout to the patreon "Uhh Uhhh Uhhh"
nice
and then it rained. 11:30
Wow that was quick, only 3 weeks after the previous video!
I've never been more excited to see a sponge.
holy moly 1h Kurzgesagt <3
Definitely felt alot
This is so great, one of the best video's of this decade.  The animation, the music! The sense of lonlyness and awe.
OH MY GOOOOOD
reach++
Kudos to bold movement. liked the music as well.
Me: No way I'll spend one hour watching an youtube video. Kurzgesagt: Hold my bier!
47:00 the music matches the countdown
This is a really great piece of media to get someone to not only feel how long 4.5 billion years is, but also to get a seance of what the Earth was like that whole time. Amazing work.
a 1 hour Kurzgesagt upload is a true blessing
i love this !! thank u kurzgesagt!
Turning off my phone, and I have to turn on my TV and sound system because of the music and visual.
Its better than hanging out in a night club so trippy
This is so freakin cool. Like holy begeesus wowza i am amazeballed to the max.
Earth: is literally on fire The music: just vibe, bro, chill for a bit.🤙🤙
19:42 When the DOOM music kicks in
super amazing project guys!
i wonder how varied life would be if not for the mass extinctions. starting at 54:00
❤
Imagine a few million years from now, an advanced species of dolphins creates this exact same video and shows the end of our Quaternary as  a spectacular explosion caused by hundreds of antimatter bombs going off at the same time.
One day i will be forgotten :)   [DiowE]
I love the Idea behind this video. I think I never felt the age of the earth as well as with this video. Geniuly amazing.
Who else skipped a few millions years? 😂
29:43 is proof we live in a simulation
Egads, who has time to sit through an hour long video? Begins watching* 20 mins in I realize... Me.. I do.
kurzgesagt really said "fuck it, here’s the entire history of the earth."
where did the rain come from?  I thought Earth was hit with ice comets for millions of years.  We need clouds first before we have rain
Thar was truly wonderful, thank you so much, and happy 10th anniversary!
Impressive
I chose a good night to get high👍
amazing
This came out at the perfect time! I was just about to do some more writing for NaNoWriMo, and this fits perfectly with my world-building scene!
Oh my.  I will enjoy this, like u will never imagine 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm very happy for the long format content I'm sharing with all my friends!
This is amazing!
This video was a masterpiece
There's a glitch in the animation at 29:44 hehe
Lets all appreciate how great the soundtrack is.
Can we ponder a bit that at this speed the sun / moon is perfectly in sync?
22:48 soundtrack here really sounds like something straight outta Doom
The music... it's like an hour-long ASMR session. Makes my hair stand up.
Finally, a video with enough Kurzgesagt.   All jokes aside, amazing video, loved listening to it
The music is so good I cancelled my RAVE plans for tonight!
19:36 is a vibe
Holy shit, I thought this was 10 minutes, not a full hour. Kuddos 👏👏
That was an experience 😮
*PERFECTO!*
Wow
I feel I don't deserve such a beautifully animated 1 hour video for literally nothing. Proud of being a part of kurzgeasagt family.
Man imma used this to eat lunch for 1 week thanks
Just bought my first merch hoodie and I love it, I’m gonna watch this with my dinner
Watched the full video while traveling on train, its remarkable how much life had to be tested before modern times. Rip the dinosaurs but the rise of humanity took over, we carry the flame and humanity should not be sorry, but be better for our homeworld. Our lesson will be now so we can learn and be guardians of life in our universe. Let's not waste the 4.5 billion years of random chance in the making, the universe might never get this type of life again for another billion of years.
no other channel would post something this high quality for free to youtube, thank you so much kurzgesagt team!!
son lo maximo!
The one thing that comforts me is that even when I'm gone the elements that make up my body may go on to make other life forms. I will still have a part to play in this universe. My grandfather always used to say that you'd think that young people invented sex the way they go on about it. He wasn't wrong.
Fuck the time we watched this video must have been less than a tenth of a nanosecond
330000th view
Please, i need this in spanish!!
This has two win at least 5 oscars. Omfg.
DAAMMMMMMMMMM BROOS RUNIGND FOR HIS MONEY I LOVE THS cahnels
Okay, the lava hell is actually gorgeous
Earth's history has a banger of a soundtrack.
This was an amazing video. Saved so I can come back and re-watch many more times.
Bill wurtz did it better.
It's a crime that YouTube has vandalized this video with ads
jesus friggin christ, *one hour.*  i don’t think i can actually watch this, it would look away from this animation, i would tune out the noise…  the effort would be *lost* on me. i can’t undermine this like that.
Damn i love this planet
Amazing perspective!!
Damn Earth History is a hell of a Rave
You guys... you're a very tough channel to outdo, but the fact that you've outdone YOURself is nothing short of monumental. This is likely the most illuminating examination of early earth on the interwebs and it's probably not even close. Also, the Earth's core formed THAT late into its life? Does that mean our magnetosphere only came about within the last billion years and wasn't present the entire time Earth existed?
A hour!!!!! a hour!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!
magnificent, literally the only thing i could have wished for is a “global average temperature” thermometer
History of the entire world i guess - remix
This is not just a video. This is an experience. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
19:57 The only thing they fear is the Mesoarchean
Can you do the human history in 1 hour?
Awesome, I hope you get 4.5 Billion views in 1h too
really cool!
Exalted is Allah above what they ascribe.
WTF video with pauses, that's not what I subscribed for...
this video just shows how young we are... and already we formed the world around us to an insane extent...
This is only history lesson I could ever get through
One hour. This should be in the cinema.
Ok hear me out: this is so awesome that you have to make a serie of videos like this one, showing the story of humanity, dinosaurs, jean passe!
This video would be 0,006 seconds according to creationists.
the fact that we are new still baffles me.
Bro waited his whole life to say life finds a way
Is there any way you make is available to download in HDR please ?? 😃 I would love to have it boucle on my TV in the background like a gallery display  Also for the 20 years, can we have the same but with what the FUTURE could look like, either one where end is destroyed, or one when it continue in space
I just watched the whole thing😍 incredible work!!
When did Adam and Even and talking snake happen?
how do the asteroids stay in the same place for thousands of years?
the music so good
Petition to make a no words version  |   | V
This is absolutely insane ❤❤❤❤
This is fabulous. It is as informative as it is Zen. I want to watch it again but with some stats in the corner of the screen that show average temperature, atmospheric composition, average day length and other interesting facts about the state of earth.
Yay!
dollar store bill wurtz
4.5B years in the making.... god hes good!
Fantastic animation.  Such a complicated and varied road to ourselves. For me answers the Fermi paradox with the rare earth hypothesis
There's a glitch here 29:44. Otherwise the animation is great though.
Kurzgesagt uploads an hour-long video on my birthday? Best gift ever.  Also, what is this 🔥 track?
I watched every single second to show my immense respect 🎉❤
Timestamp! I am now in 37:42 , I'll be back later!
Near the beginning I was shocked to realize how early life actually got started. Then about midway through I remembered each second represented 1.5 million years and it hit me like a ton of bricks, there's an unbroken chain of life that has led to my existence. To my countless ancestors who survived hell on Earth: thank you! To everyone else: life is beautiful, cherish ever second.
it isn't as simple as the asteroid killed the dinosaurs.
This is a MASTERPIECE!
Actively just watching this at 2x speed really amazing stuff
The animation is amazing and I've been jamming out to the music.
So, roughly speaking, if Earth appeared an hour ago then: -first single-cell life happened around 45-50 minutes ago,  -multicellular organisms had their "exploson" 7 minutes ago, -dinosaurs went extinct 64 seconds ago, -first human appered 2 seconds ago, -12k years of human history lasted less than blink of an eye.  Now my head hurts, but also my life's problems look really small and meaningless. Thanks... I guess?
I've not watched the whole thing yet (just getting to the end of of the Paleoarchean - NO SPOILERS PLEASE), but this is so beautiful. I love the music.  If I've done the maths right, does the entirety of human history fit in one frame?
Can we get a video with the music and visuals without the talking over too?
I lofe this chenel
wow
28:00 Donkey Kong Country 3 vibes
was eating a pizza while watching. Took over a billion years to finish
Oh wow! This is amazing!!
It’s still raining since 3770 million years ago in the UK
like allwayes , impresive thank you for making this content
Amazing video!  I'm disappointed that we get zero mention of biota like the Francevillian biota. Complex life emerged longer ago, before the Ediacaran - it was just cut short by all the ice ages.  Also no shots of the Moon with an atmosphere and water. Or the Canfield ocean.  It would also have rained earlier, as early as 4.4 Gya and it would have been a long process. So the whole Eoarchaean shot likely would have transpired earlier and in a shorter timeframe, from 4.4 to 4 Gya. Earth probably started off with an extremely thick atmosphere after Theia, blotting out any features in the sky and tinting everything in yellow like Venus. So rain would have started off as virga until enough CO2 was sequestered that it cooled to the point of allowing liquid water to exist at the surface. And this likely would have been at high temperatures but also elevated pressures.  The first photosynthesizers were probably not all green but incorporated other colors like purple. These kinds of bacteria still exist today, they just got outcompeted by cyanobacteria.  The Ordovician and Silurian are also quite sparse, and Devonian cephalopods actually emerged during the Ordovician.  Still, it's otherwise a great video.
To all viewers reading this comment, we are very lucky and fortunate enough to be able to born in this era where we can consume this type of content for free. Lets take a moment to appreciate it 🙂🙂🤝🤝
The History of Everything I Guess: Extended ASMR version.
It gives you quite a different idea of how long everything took to develop. That was amazing!
When might we see an episode that covers all of human history from our earliest ancestors to today?
Thanks to this video. I can now last 7.5 million years in bed. Life changer
29:38 ... So you're saying the entire atmosphere caught on fire??
mad props to the cameraman who filmed this and turned it into animation with the help of the editor
A One hour Kurzgesagt video?! Yes please!!
I love this video, thank you
Rick and morty is also free
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
❤❤❤ thanks , that's amazing , so much to learn , so fun to watch
Amazing job!
How is this free…. We live in such an amazing time
I really hope you guys inspire kids to get into science. Your channel is wonderful.
Thank god, now I got something to rewatch everyday before sleep.
Animation glitch at 29:43 (sorry Kurzgesagt animators, I just had to point it out)
YOU MADE A KURZESAGT MOVIE?!?!😂😂 FOR FREE??? THANK YOU KURZESAGT TEAM ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️
such a wonderful journey. Thank you
A visual and musical prog masterpiece
At 29:45 there is a glitch animated
This cameraman is hugely underrated. The fact that they survived 4.55 billon years an survived multiple extinction events and the collision of Theia what a guy
Amazing. You should make a evolution themed video game. 😊
Been in the making since the earth was born
0:43 ♫ Now the moon ♫ 0:51 Weather update, it's raining rocks from outer space. 8:04 Severe flooding alert! The entire world is now an ocean. 12:40 ♫ Something's alive in the ocean ♫ 12:43 It lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup which is being served hot and fresh 17:56 ♫ Now you can eat sunlight! ♫ 27:47 Side effect, now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky is blue 30:16 Then the Earth might have been a snowball for a while. Maybe even a couple of times. 42:17 ♫ The Sun is a deadly laser ♫ 53:15 It's a sponge. It's a plant. It's a worm, and some other types of weird, strange water bugs and strange fish. 53:35 ♫ It's the Cambrian explosion! ♫ 53:40 ♫ Not anymore, there's a blanket ♫ 55:00 Okay, will you learn to walk if there's plants up here? 55:55 ♫ Bye bye, ocean! ♫ 56:56 Oh fuck, now everything's dead. Just kidding, here are the survivors. 59:48 ♫ And the dinosaurs are gone! ♫ 59:57 It's mammal time! Here come the mammals; look at those breasts. 1:00:44 Gneurshk
YOOOO the Paleogene background music is banging!  straight  heaaat🔥🔥🔥🔥 1:00:00
you recommended to leave it on in the background, but i watched it intently
The only bad thing on kurzgesagt   It is the chrisians and muslims on the comment section calling his videos ""atheist propaganda"
Don't blink or you'll miss the whole of human history.  *Cuts to commercial
Huge reapect to the cameraman for enduring hell for a cool time lapse.
And here I was skimming the middle of the video looking for the dinosaurs. What. A. D**k.
Beautiful, and it puts things to perspective
This is just straight up impossible. I feel I need to pay something to atleast watch just the first 10 minutes of this video
Holy shit
Just wonderful this video 🤩
"4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour, I guess"
WOW THANK YOU GUYS!! <3
This is a random and unexpected treat from you all, but I can't help but think about how much we DO know about what happened in those periods for there to be silence in even a 10 hr length version.
1:15 the name of the greek god of underworld is actually Kyriakos Grizzly, just a small digression
nice
Thank-you. Montessorians will love this!
this is an amazing masterpiece!!!
Best video possible
love how many soundtracks are in this, so good
Ectasian beat goes hard  also 44:55
What a time to be alive in this world and fortunate enough to consume these type of content for free. Thank thank you very much kurzgesagt 🙂🙂🙂
Love the music and beautiful animaiton
Did the music get more and more emotional toward the end or is it just me? Also props to everyone who has been working on this since 2019❤.
ill be real i aint watching this shit in one day
1 hour of not only music BUT ANIMATION? bravo for the whole team! love it
history of the entire world, i guess
The Mesoarchaean and Carboniferous have got to be the most beautiful time in Earth's history
good try, but Bill Wurtz is better
Neoarchean underwater scene is blue colored?  Shouldn't the underwater light from above in the sky be in some other color before oxygen appeared in the scene?
I understand what a million year is but billions; oh man! Just thinking about the lifetime of earth compared to the lifetime of the human is such a hard thing to grasp, how we think we've experienced so much yet, in comparison to the universe we've haven't even began to scratch the surface!
That Hadean area stuff was awesome
This is amazing
I got lost somewhere in the video so I’m lost IN time. Do I just go back to the beginning or start somewhere random?
Bill Wurtz would be proud
SEX RELEASED 1.2 BILLION YEARS AND THERE IS NO UPDATE STILL? COME ON BRUH 😭
Oh my...
Love the vids
This was great! I was able to do things while watching and didn't need super attention. Loved it!
The fact this is is absolutely free, makes it wild!!
Little too much dead space. Could have been sped up. I work too much to sit through lol
This would make amazing live wallpaper material
You guys did a good job on showcasing the magnitude of just how slow and steady nature is. But I still cant get around the fact that my entire life, and even the entire human race as a whole is contained within a single frame of this video.
Babe wake up, Kurzgesagt just dropped an hour long video
Dude what was this awesomeness? I loved it!
Great idea - how has nobody done it like this before? (OK, Carl Sagan did it in Cosmos but having it actually take an hour and all of human evolution passing in a blink at the end really hammers it home more than a picture!)  Soundtrack was good but can't help but think that an epic Tool-like prog rock instrumental soundtrack would be even better :D
awesome
:0
awsome
It's amazing! 🤩
woah
Great video! amazing, is there an album in spotify with only the songs? I'll like to hear them is great background music
Undeniable proof the cameraman can never die
Absolutely outstanding. Sent chills down my spine with all the music and animation. Love you guys, everyone did such great work
The ending was _expectedly_ hilarious. The morbid thing is that we might never get past that blink. We're at the crossroads of our existence. Thanks to dictators. The parasites of the human species.
wait a sec it really is 1 hour long video 0_0 dayum
Let it cook
kurgesagt is the best channel in 4.5 billion years!
Project this on a wall and have a deep chat with your favorite person while watching the eons go by
Crazy to think that on this universal time scale, human technological advancement is actually progressing insanely quickly relative to the speed in which the universe evolves.
This was absolutely beautiful! Thank you guys so so SO much for all your hard work
If you set the playback speed to 1.375x he speaks in the same voice and speed as in regular Kurzgesagt videos.
It really is comforting to know that even if we humans fuck everything up and reduce everything to ash, it'll take the earth a very short time to shrug off everything humans ever did to impact earth in just a fraction of the time compared to its lifespan. And since life's already evolved this much on earth, there's no way we can kill everything that nature can do over the course of millions of years. Not even blowing the planet up would prevent life from making new intelligent life in a matter of a few million years.
This video gave me an existential crisis.
Whow.
This was amazing!
i want a lofi version of this
Too long, 15 min would be enough
Maybe in another 4 years, we can get another hour long video that starts at multicellular life. It seems like so much stuff had to be left out to keep it from getting incoherent
Absolutel 🔥 beats
ah yes, I have also attended math class before
I'd enjoy this music and animation more while hitting a blunt
Now they just need to release version thats in real-time
I like how the oldest period I recognize starts 57 minutes in lol
as someone who lived for 4.5 billions of years, I can confirm this is true
it shows we are insects trying to prove something. 😊
Amazing that so much has happened across Earth's history that ultimately leading to me having to go to work and pay taxes
Already liked even if I have not watched it. Scheduling a night with friends for this very purpose eheh
I bet the Kurzgesaght team just wanted an excuse to make a podcast
lol you forgot to mention that time I shit my pants in class and everyone laughed at me
This was beautiful, but i think the year count is messed up in the beginning, it says "million" instead of "billion" :(.  Love you guys either way, please never stop making content.
Such a new concept. Fantastic stuff Kurtzgesagt team.
This- this is amazing...
Kurzgesagt! Aber heute ist langgesagt😂
Here before 1M views!
the music reminds me of a band called "The Ocean" at some points which is funny because they also have made albums and songs dedicated to the eons of earth!
What an awesome video! Love it. Being a house music fan: the music is great too!! 😊
Oh damn it, I wanted to say the "Oh no, I blinked! I missed all of human history!" thing.  Poor cave bro got caught in 4K though.
So that’s why I haven’t been seeing as many uploads
i just started see you in an hour
If you watched all of this in one sitting and didn't fast-forward, Like this comment! I know I did!
I often wonder what crazy christians think when they see videos like these lmfao
Can we get a track upload for the Rhyacian period? Its too good 30:50  Edit: 11 months later and still waiting for that Rhyacian track to drop please 😅
guys new history of the entire world i geuss just dropped
Here I was getting a tad annoyed that it's been a few weeks since an upload...I see where that time went. Truly incredible, thank you all so much.
Well done!
realy nice keep going Love your vids kongrats the the team bihind this
The history of humans tells you how people evolved. The history of the earth tells you how the earth evolved. We are guests on this rock, nothing more. Our time will come and go just like the rest of the universe.
I would kill for this to be in wallpaper engine
1 hour !? Omg ! You don't have any idea how much it took to make this video 😮
Soundtrack sounds like Maserati
Watching this whole vid to see if I can find Goku somewhere in the background
Nice bass guitar in mesoarchean era.
Mark Twain supposedly said, "“I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” I like this idea.
Wow i accidentally blink and skip all the human history
This is really cool.
thats a funny idea. a brain just floating around space, trying to grasp me.
Camera is as old as earth 😆
This is amazing, thank you!
Oh my god, props to you Kurzgesagt!👏 thank you once more
So basically "Not a lot of anything happened for a long time, then everything happened pretty much all at once at the end.
This is one of the best things you could have ever made.
How long is a eyon?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Any chance you guys release a version with no narration and only music + sfx?
This deserves an animation award of some kind.
no shot
Ill be putting this video before sleeping, the music and the voice is so peaceful!
this is actually a dj set👀 one of the styles that's more of an environmental story than mainstage rave dance
This is incredible.
I was present during that time. I verify these information as 80% accurate. Good job Team!!  P.S. we fucking don't know what happened millions of years ago
I am here for the house music 🎶
A lot of these theories just seem like how religion is made "it rained for millions of years to make the ocean". How did the water appear out of lava and obsidian?
This video is insane. Really puts into perspective how unique the era we live in now is
Give the cameramen a raise 🗿🍷
I watched all of this, it’s amazing
What a great surprise, I did not know I needed this to make my day feel a tiny bit better, which means a lot to me. Thank you so much for this time travel Kurzgesagt!
In fact at the time of writing, almost as many comments as there are millions of years in the Earth's history.
Thank you.
Hope this video sees 4.5 billion views
Good video.
I’m so so happy I bought a calendar cause I love actively helping this channel  Thank you Kurzgesagt ❤
1 hour kurtzgesagt video!!!! I love you guys thank you for this amazing birthday present cuz it was my birthday a few days ago!!!! <333
Wow, you guys have been on this project since 2019? That was the year I opened my channel up! Congrats for finishing this project in time for your 10th anniversary!
Let's take a moment to remember those who have to watch ads.
The best album from this band so far.
genius video
this is incredible, thank you for making it
Religious people:
"history of the entire world, i guess"
The adds ruins everything.
Up 🎉
thank you so much for the subtitles, most don't bother typing an hour long video :)
i watched X2 speed so i guess it took me 3 millions years for second :D
finally a video longer than 3 minutes without the ads
I ENJOYED THE RIDE, THANK YOU
Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell just emerged in the last 8 micro second. what a time to be alive...
Wow! I cant wait to watch this! So long!
Where do i pay the money this deserves?
If you blink you miss it.
Props to the camera man.
The animators: 🗿🍷
Props to the cameraman who recorded 4.5 billion years👍
Bro this is amazing
Most Epic Kurzgesagt video ever!  And with music like that, 1B years passes quicker than 8 hours in a boring job.
That was amazing to watch. Life really takes it’s time huh
90 million years, and the earth still cooking
Which song is in the paleogene?
This might be my favorite video ever
과학이 아닌, 철저히 진화론이라는 패러다임에 갇혀 그 기준으로 해석하고 설명하는 영상. 진화론은 증명도 안 되고 증거도 없는 (아니 오히려 진화론과 반대되는 증거들이 넘쳐나는) 잘못된 믿음일 뿐이다. 그런대도 언론과 교육을 통해 끊임없이 세뇌한 결과 대부분의 사람들이 진화론이 사실이고 과학인 줄 알고 있다. 너무나 심각한 잘못된 교육이자 문제점이다. 진화론과 오랜 지구 역사는 결코 사실이 아니다!
HOLY SHIT WHAT??? You guys are amazing!
The soundtrack to this video is genuinely really good omg was not expecting kurzgesagt to drop the soundtrack of the year...
the Kurzgesagt movie frfr
I appreciate the artstyle you've chosen to approximate. At this time/speed, all motion would be seen as MUCH faster, but doing so negates any educational value.
Wow! What an awesome journey! I wish I could give you 4.5 million likes for this
crazy idea, really cool
This was genuinely so cool.
Holy shit...
the camera man is the first player in the lobby
The fact that all human history didn't even represent 1 second of the video is astonishing, like how did I not see that coming? Awesome video btw ❤
How did the Plants "create" soil?
This is insane
This is one of the most impressive works of art ive seen so far, over an hour of well made music and astonishingly good animation, along with well acted voice lines. incredible work!
This is perfect to fall asleep to but I want to see the beautiful animation.
Another amazing one. Thanks!
You guys just went nuts on this one! This is one of a kind
Holy cr@p😲😲  Best Christmas gift!!!    Thanks Kurtzgesagt ❤
Considering what humans may do to earth this could become a great looping background lol
I dont know Rick
music is amazing
Holy hell it's all animated
45:00   We’ve found the inventor of sex you guys. Pack it up Ned
Loved it! Please, do something similar with the Evolution of the Universe.
The care that went into this...
YOO I AM THE 55,5K LIKER
What is the piano music at the end?
Wake up babe a 1 hour vid by in a nutshell dropped
No
They music during the entire episode is amazing... But the first, "the floor is lava" is incredible!
Very Epic video! Kurzgesagt Love from - That Programer!
imagine this was live-streamed. Everyone would freak out that these guys have a whole movie live-streamed
that Stenian beat, tho
Who put doom music in the Mesoarchean era?
How does one invent sex?
This is a very cool concept and is perfectly executed. We can always expect 10/10 content from this channel.
Don’t blink or you might miss the humanity, we are in fact so young, it’s bizarre. Yet somehow we have managed to make so much crap around that it will be here long after we have been gone.
Came for the science stayed for the vibes!
that last part dont blink or you might miss all of human history made me smile
I find it ironic that a channel called "Kurzgesagt" released an hour long video, and yet it's still an incredibly brief summary of the topic.
this is by far the coolest kurzgesagt video and thats saying something! BIG KUDOS!
The one hour… the one hour Kurzegesagt video is real 🗣️🔥
Woah I was not expecting an hour long video!   Props to animators for spending possibly years to make this
whoa this is so cool, im glad this is the first video they released after i subscribed a few days ago
I want to put this on the background of my computer
wish this could a live wallpaper for my laptop, it would be epic
Its really a please for eyes to see it on my second screen, and listening to such music in headset joy for my tired of pop music ears. Ahhh calm
Wow what a service! Thank you so much Kurzgesagt team for giving an HOUR long video for our pleasure! This is truly an eye candy for me.
sat down and watched the entire thing.. thank you
Amazing ... life is just a very short interlude on planet Earth.
Um, that doesn't make sense sorry but the pyramids were clearly made by someone more advanced than primative man. Humans were much more advanced in the past. In order to build the pyramids they needed to be more advanced than we are today. This suggests humans must have been whiped out in the past as advanced as they were. We are recovering from whatever set us back.
The stuff we watch at 2:41 AM when we have an exam today
Lo-Fi hip hop to chill/study/ contemplate existence to
I had to sit and watch it in religious silence.... It would have been a crime to keep it in the background and do something else!!! Unbelievable, what an experience!!!
The fact that they teamed up with YouTube to make this video available as a Picture to Picture alone is underrated!
Spoiler alert: 40 minutes in and it's yet just bacteria. No monkey in sight.
This is probably one of my favourite videos on YouTube
0:01 funfact: you can not move the mouse faster around the earth than light does 7 full rotations around the earth in one second
Cine.
Jesus Christ, I can imagin this as a goa party inside a pretty large stadion or outside in the middle of a forest. Amazing 🎉
Wow, they actually wrote a pretty decent music back in the Mesoarchean
Some of the meteors just dissapear XD
chould u maybe show the atmospheric details and temprature of the era no need to update it a few times in the era only when the era changes
A video on the history of mankind would require a collaborative with the slomo guys.
Absolutely astronomical, this video. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
What a humbling perspective... Thank you Kurzgesagt!
I like how humans think they can control their environment so well when it’s plants that dictate who breathes and who dies.
Great work
Loved it
🎵 The Cambrian Explosion 🎵 53:37
This is my favourite thing you’ve ever done.
Meh, I stopped after 18 minutes of fast forwarding... Why not make a 20 minute, tight video of the history of the Earth? This was just... Unsatisfying.
Cool screensaver :D
I love this video so much! This really helps put into perspective just how old Earth really is and get a less biased view of the history of life. Really makes me appreciate just how long it took for life to get as complex as it is today! Thank you so much for all the blood, sweat, and tears this video took to make! It's my favorite on this entire channel!
👏👏👏
Kurzgesagt's been on fire these past few months
Can they also explain how is the ocean salty?
As a young kid I drew a world history like this on a several meters long strip of taped together paper, rolled up like a scroll. The first part was not very interesting to look at...
BRO THIS MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!! holy crap. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is just amazing. The music is incredible!
45:00 huge props for inventing sex.
Woooh, I made it to the end. 10/10 video.
Huge fan of the music selection!!!
1 HOUR!! The Kurzgesagt team has really outdone themselves this time, I can't wait to watch this!
I thought it only took 7 days to create the world
I don't even have enough mobile internet data to watch this in Full HD 😢 how did they even make this well researched (I assume) & incredible looking (I assume) Animated 1hr long video?!
❤
great video and oh man this would be a great wallpaper for my pc
we get to watch this for FREE? damn, nothing but thanks for this and all the contents. mad respect
PROPS TO THE CAMERA MAN 👏👏👏
Fire
Ayo im 0 Mill years old
does anyone know if they have a spanish channel with this video ? i want to show this to my kids
Thank you so much for releasing this for free for us 😭♥️ masterpiece
A 1h long kurtz video ?! Holly sweet potatoe !
The Tony-an period... 🇮🇹😎🤌
Is this the longest Kurzgesagt video ever made?
i want to like twice!
WAHOO AN HOUR LONG VIDEO WOO YEAH BABIEEE
I have a doubt regarding the Eoarchean period, and it is that it started to rain when the planet began to cool, and if (as far as I know) rain is formed from the evaporation of water, and if the planet was so hot, ¿How did rain occur in the cooling process? PD: I love all the work they have done to create this high quality animated video, the effort put behind this is truly admirable.
Key point, sex was only discovered on earth 45:00 in!
Ah damn I blinked, guess the humans are dead
I loved every single second.
anyone else see the doctor who reference?
Weeeeeeeee!!!!
8:55 The lightning animation is done so well , the far out lightning inside the clouds. Honestly , Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell is a huge part of YouTube. Love you guys for all the hard work you put in for us.
Insane, I love this channel very much
Actually the earth is 4.6 billoin years old
As a Kid I insisted that the floor was lava, nobody believed me. Now i can prove it ;)
if earth was as long as a human lifetime, 722 days would be one second
Good video
"hi youre on a rock floating in space"
I just watched the whole history of the planet and she hasn’t relied 😢😢😢
I hope we get such a journey in VR as a game as well this would be an absolute blast.
1 Hour of high quality animation in 4K... This is YouTube history
Another level...a masterpiece !!
If the whole history of the Earth took one hour...   Homo sapiens evolved in the last 0.24 seconds.  The first signs of civilisation appeared in the last 8 miliseconds. A human life lasts about 60 microseconds. A blink of an eye takes 2000 times longer.   Value your time.
Wow such knowledge just for free a d 1 HOUR?!! Such pretty music
I love the passion that Kurzgesagt have! Big suport from México
Great video !! Thanks !
Who clicked thinking Bill Wurtz was back on the menu?
the man third in line for presidency believes the world is six thousand years old
Keep talking so that you can make it also a podcast type thing.🙂🙂👍Great work. I wish you good luck for the feature work 👍👍🤞
52:23 Wait so I think that Gondwa the map in Path of Titans is based off of Gondwana in real life
Eoarchean (what a stupid name, who puts three vowels together? prob only those archAEOlogists...) must have been the best morning shower ever. Just imagining sitting in the rain, sEEIng the water slowly rise with a rolling thunder in the distance, for 400 mio years... absolute dream!
I’m not sure what this is: A) the coolest live wallpaper ever B) the coolest background music jam ever
[bill wurts has entered the chat]
32:33 papież
Best beats ❤
Impressed by the cameraman for getting such beautiful images over so many years!!
Quite the ride… ‘Greenhouse gasses much hot and comfy’
There was more effort put into this one video than the rest of Dc's and Marvel's recent movies ☠☠☠
Wait a Kurzgesagt video of 1 hour???? That's freaking amazing! Can't wait to watch it 😁
58:13 🤣
I want to do a techno rave to this
How do i make this my wallpaper?
The longest game of the floor is lava
I like how everyone is propping the editor for how long this must have taken but nobody is saying good this music is 🎵
now you can eat sunlight - bill wurtz 18:01
Cool
Okay but why does the late mesoarchean go hard. I'm loving this so far, the music is so good
After all that. I still cant understand why they call it toothpaste. Really should be teethpaste
Kurzgesagt is undoubtedly my favourite YouTube channel ever not because of their such amazing animation and concepts but because of their simplified explanation which is itself an art.
camera man is 4.5 billion years old wow
Joke's on you. I've watched at 2× speed.
Im so here for this well done guys!!!
18:25 Bookmark :D
This video is a absolutely incredible! It's novel and entertaining, and beautiful! I love it!
Holy sh*t I'm making popcorn for this one!
Could you release a version of this without the commentary? Commentary is great, but having an alternate version for background stuff would be awesome.
1 HOUR OF ANIMATON FROM KURZGESAGT TAHTS CRAZYYYY
Why the doom music in the Mesoarchean lol
This is pretty cool!  It makes me feel good to be present.. Thanks!
The music in the eoarchean psriod is on beat with the water drops  Amazing
The fact that all of this is animated so nicely is astonishing (basically like 6 videos mashed into one)
53:35 it's the caaaambrian explosion
YES
Let’s not take for granted this amazing music that underscores this truly exceptional content you guys put out.
I suddenly have the urge to listen to Fatboy Slim
this time I haven't gotten fooled into watching a vid about your posters (they are gtreat) and got exited about a new vid. great content :D
this video does a great job of putting the scale of history into perspective, it was so surreal seeing how close humans are to the dinosaurs compared to everything else
Muy buen trabajo, realmente es una de las mejores cosas que he visto en Youtube en mi vida. Perdón si lo escribo en español pero ha sido espectacular. Mis felicitaciones.
WE GET THIS MASTERPIECE FOR FREE???? IT FEELS ILLEGAL.
Zog History class
This is literally a work of art. I mean it. Like, it should be nominated for something and played at film festivals and stuff.
THANK YOU! I don't know what else I can say but thank you. Love you Kurzgesagt!
i doubt it lol
Wow! What an ambitious video. That was very fun!
This is going to break the internet! 😲
AN HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO?!?!?! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! MY WILDEST DREAM HAS COME TRUE!
The entire first 15 minutes of this is sounding an awful lot like a Deadmau5 continuous mix! Props to Epic mountain for making a killer soundtrack to vibe with while watching the birth of our rock.
Thanks for 4K!
Its amazing that you made an hour of animation, and you put this out for free. Keep making awesome stuff kursgesagt! 😁😁😁👍👍
:happy:
Camera man never dies. Even old age can't kill him!
I guess some things are just stated and not explained, like where did rain come from, why asteroids kept coming and stopped, why the planet freezed, etc. Nevertheless, excellent video.
The music sounds a lot like it was composed by Mittsies.
Be aware! There are spoilers in the comments
Going through knd of a lot right now, and this video makes me appreciate life a lot more than I normally do. I'm not even kidding.  We have so much shit going on in our heads, day to day, and yet we are so incredibly small and insignificant over all.
”fungi extend their tubular arms and do ✨fungi things ✨”
Totally missed a huge part in Evolution regarding Mushrooms, they are the ones that let life on land.... disappointed....
When the music kicks in! Everything changes holy shit lol this video is freaking awesome! Hell yeah guys!
What an effort!! They should have kids in school watch this in science class.
Had to Double check if this video is from the real channel or one of these 1hr of kurzgesagt channels. Just wow
If I could put this as a looping screensaver on my tv I would have it on constantly. Thank you for another amazing video!
Now the same for moon please
❤
Только вопрос , как дым и пар пошел без атмосферы и воздуха, а потом еще дожди?
Gorgeous and fascinating, like every video by Kurzgesagt! 💖🙌 Thank you
This was both hella boring, and interesting at the same time.
i was here
45:00 ok algae Bangiomorpha pubescens. its been 1190 million years, when's sex 2 coming?
Absolutely astounding. 👏
the music on this is so cool🔥 use headphones, you’ll get what I mean
Does the iron core "crystal" that forms around 42:30 maybe help life to evolve? Is this when the magnetosphere would form? Helping shield evolving life from harmful radiation?
Nice, a long video
47:35 Kurzgesagt I think you forgot to mention that the Appalachain Mountain Range started to form
Love this kind of videos, excellent job! Hoping to see the Neogene 1h video, or the human history 1h video next.
Props to the editor for tanking 5 extinction events just so we can have this video
This is perhaps the best video on YouTube
The soundtrack for this video is AMAZING
I think I'm gonna save this video until I have some wizard herbs
Wow my god best video ever
They should do "The Entire History of World, I guess".
This ending gave me goosebumps! Amazing!
What a score!
This is a jam
This is absolutely insane
First! Just kidding.
The new 12024 calendar was a hint of this video
This is so ambitious. Even as an animator. ❤Looks so cool 😊
Imagine how lucky we are to have access to information and communications of today. All of the emperors, kings, generals and leaders of the past would sell their souls for this kind of information. Information so advanced and so widespread that a common citizens of first world countries easily have access to it. It is mind boggling how we have the information to so many subjects and theories. Yet most of us don't understand how internet is our next step to human advancement in technology, it is a huge step already that we have the internet, imagine what we could achieve if it were not for wars, bloodshed, conflicts, coups and terrorisms. Our ancestors would die 100 times over just to get access to information about one of the major subjects such as tech, biology and economics. Thanks Kurzgesagt for providing and spreading the knowledge of space.
future me, was this video worth it? (im in the Hadean era)
If you combine art and science you get this masterpiece!
This would be an amazing live wallpaper for wallpaper engine...
Absolutely incredible for putting into perspective just how ancient Earth is, and how incredibly "brief" all of humanity is.  You guys do incredibly inspiring work.
From this video i realized how young multi celled life is.
_You can make a religion out of this_
The music to this amazing in its self
...for many different reasons 😏
Im sure youve thought of this but wouldnt it be cool to see a part 2 with the next 4.5 Billion years until our Sun dies
A rendering issue at 29:43
So this is the History of the entire world, I guess
This was awesome.
Yall are crazy this is amazing
You're on a rock floating in space..
19:50 What is this music? Did doomguy apper on earth?
Props to the camera man. What a project, 4.5 billion years to make. Masterpiece
Damn
wow they had some excellent cameras 4.5 billion years ago
This is insane, very slow claps.   Btw can you share what music plays during the Orosirian period? i just really like it lmao
I have now been here since the dawn of our time.
GREECE MENTIONED 🦅🦅🦅🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
I watched every second
Is there any reason why all the meteoroid impacts in the Hadean were all generally coming from the same direction, or was it just artistic license?
Absolutely fantastic!
2h
im glad they had cool tunes to listen to while living
Im puttting this as my wallpaper
This was so amazing
In the world of fast content and short attention spans I wonder what viewing metrics are like on stuff like this.
This is indisputable proof the cameraman never dies, 4.5 billion years and still going.
Kurzgesagts animation has improved a lot.😊😊
Who else watched this at 2x speed?
dam im old
I love made in heaven!
44:53 the best part
How many times may I hit the like button?
Woah reading that a 1 hour video was posted 1 hour ago felt like I was having a fever dream I had to double take. This must have been nuts to make
I'm sorry but this video is flawed in a few ways.  The grammatical error by the narrator near the end of the first section. The fact that you have 4.5 billion years of information available but can't fill an hour video with dialog, leaving incredibly long gaps of "dead air"(ignoring the music) but, on the music, why is this music the same type used in videos meant to be played as background noise? It makes it impossible to pay attention to the entire video without missing quite a lot of the sparse dialog because you're zoned out since it's been over a minute since anything but generic music was playing.  I understand that you wanted to put the time line in perspective. But this video could have sped up the time line to match the amount of time that the narrator was speaking about each era, cutting out all the unnecessary "dead air". Or.. all dialog could have been cut and this could just have been a screen saver.. trying to do both takes away from both.
Truly... The cameraman never dies. Amazing content! 👏
wow, the constant song make this video fell like if we were in Mindustry 3900 million years ago.
HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO???
Just can say Thank you for 10 years of entertaining and educational content. Kurzgesagt is still among the best channels on Youtube.
This is great.
Around the Calymmian I'm wondering if you guys hired Steven Sugar to help with the clouds
I'm glad Trazyn the Infinite took the time to document this during the Great Sleep  also help he won't let me out of his collection
Spent the first half billion year history of Earth eating some leftover sandwich from the other day. Had one hell of a time finishing it while watching this well made video
Bro really went “the entire history of the world, we guess”
1. Brilliant video this is awesome I loved watching it. 2. Wow Kurzgesagt has so many employees i watched the credits and it was about 30 people that is ridiculous. 3. Steve's voice is so nice to listen to he should start his own asmr channel. 4.thanks for the upload, i did homework while watching. made my day
🎉 I never thought I'd see the day!!
je suce
I liked the video and some comments even if i disnt see it yet, i know is amazing just to think about 1 hour of video
A 1 hour kurdgagzet video. Something I would never dream of ❤❤❤❤
One word, Masterclass
Thank you for this amazing video! 1h is an insane amount of time for an animation ❤
Can’t wait to get home to watch this tonight. You guys are the BEST.
Weird to think that for the majority of life's history, it was limited to single celled organisms. Once this video gets to complex, multicellular life, it all goes by so quickly.
This was just incredible, watched it all way through.
Comfy
Everything from concept to execution of this video was brilliant. An hour well spent!
Is this the video that finished Youtube? Like can just close the platform now? I mean you're not going to top this...
Whoever made that music for this deserve a raise. Even if its a free video.
Amazing, a wonderful job!
Funny, the Earth is sooo old, but some few Humans Destroy it in less, less years. I would cry, if i could.
just what i needed for a 1 hour car drive
How the songwriter was able to write a song with 4.5 billion years of lenght is beyond me
how to turn 7 mins of content into a 1 hour video
This is so cool, really impressed at how much time this took too.
history of the entire world, i guess (kurzgesagt ver)
Holy jesus one hour of animation. I shall spent the next 5 billion years watching this
ey, why is this music so good?
This is probably gonna be amazing (before I watched)
I get it was supposed to be an experiment, but I'd rather have a shorter video where there's actually something being said all the time, my ADHD brain gets bored too fast to just sit around watching nothing
Langgesagt Kurzgesagt special
This really shows the difference between a million and a billion
This is absolutely beautiful i cannot begin to comprehend how much work was put into this🔥🔥
Amazing video!
I came hear for some knowledge, but stayed cause the music slapped
Can we also get a video about the human history, starting from the origins all the way to the present? I’ll wait all the time you need
My TikTok brain is struggling And yet i remain watching  And i dont even use TikTok
Happy 10 year anniversary! Thanks for doing what you do and educating the world in a fun and understandable way. I’ve loved all the videos since I’ve stumbled on this channel. Amazing work!
Gunna say this now, this is Kurzgesagt's magnum opus video
watching on 1.5x speed
Hey idk if I'm wrong but at 1:16  it says 4.5 million years and I'm pretty sure it should be billion but idk just wanted to double check with yall
i love this =) <3
to get an idea of how long 4.5 billion years is... you won't even live 4.5 billion seconds which is 142 years 1 billion seconds = around 32 years
Greatest video ever, but u barely mention the trilobites 😢
When he said  "life is starting to eat the  sun" I was like what????... ohhh photosynthesis🤦🏿‍♂️
Just seeing how long earth was under hit nand trial method and how late life came and how new we are and how far we have come. It gives goosebumps
Reply to my comment if you think YouTube should remove the comment section permanently.
This is just made for watching on acid🤤
What a musical masterpiece… wow. I’m truly blown away. And the visuals… just gorgeous. I’m lucky I have a home theater, so I could experience this as demanded by the sheer amount of work that this journey represents. This DESERVES an award.
this is the best video uploaded to this platform, ever! no words can express the admiration!
man ,earth lore , amazing, waiting for the spanish version to show it up to my grannie! edit: watching this with subnautica music is in another lever
Why didn’t I ever realise I needed that? Thanks
Amazing time lapse must have taken millions of years to make
Can we get videos more often please these are my favorite
Best channel on YouTube
Is this a dream? Do I really read 1:03:31?
Everything here is great, period. But this is by far on of the best videos!
Never really thought about this, but seing how early and "easily" life developed on earth (literally as soon as the floor wasnt lava anymore), it could mean that there is probably life everywhere in the universe. Tons of planets in some stars goldilock zones, tons of them with water. I doubt there is much bipedal alien life, but microorganisms and single celled life should be literally everywhere possiblem
Wow 1hour for a video that fit in 10min 😂
Distinguished guests, we are experiencing what is going to be the future of Education.
This reinforced my assumptions that there must be something true about the great filter Theory.
_The soundtrack in this goes SO HAAAARD_
Kurzg really out here doing crazy beats to study to videos
sooooo nice, thank's for the great work.
the cameraman never dies 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
This video was insanely beautiful.
Kurzgesagt is basically the worlds best science teacher for the internet at this point
And people still really believe GOD exists. SMH. I hate this era of Earth.
blud ive been laying on my bed bieng useless for a good 4 billion years
Mission failed. I still can't grasp the true length of 4.5 Billion years
Very cool video Kurzgesagt. About 3800 Million years in i had to go wee. Back now for the rest of the video. Can't wait till the trademark birds apear. Im putting off cooking my tea for this. 230 thousand views in 2 hours. Well done. The music is hypnotic trance. Cool.
Yeah it must be really hard to do that
I think my question will be stupid for some but why are the meteorites at the start have flame trails if it was said that the atmosphere was mostly CO2 wouldn't flames require O2 ?
Wow... What a treat...
Congratulations, you've just died.   Now choose a new timeline to be born in... (type of vibe)
This is a lot to ask, but could there also be a version withour voices? That would be great  for studying!
Aaw man 29:43 🎞🎞
Happy 10 year anniversary to my favorite channel! Amazing work! 🥳💜
This video is amazing. Thank you!
It took 100 Million years just to roll the credits!
From first seconds i've already realised, it was hell to animate
55:50 that fish
0:23 dimetrodon    0:26 velociraptor         0:31 pramechaterium
THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE ALL OF IT SO MUCH!!
"We've worked on this video on and off since 2019" Man, I thought this would've been worked on since 4.5 billion years ago, what a bummer.
1:36 „and the floor is lava“… oh shit they played this game early on 😂 who noticed this as well?
I like this content a lot, and this video is amazing, thank you!
My daughter and I love you guys! We have been watching you since she was three years old( four years ago). We bought the book Immune. This is my favorite video so far. Please make more long form ones like this. Also open a store where we can buy older merch from you. We missed out on quite a bit
Thank you for given us the best video of youtube 1 hour of animation is crazy big big thanks to all how worked on this masterpiece
Just finished the entire video, what a journey
This channel is just INSANELY GOOD at thi point!
I am happy to be apart of kurzegesgat.
I was here
I *did* enjoy this video, but I'd like to suggest that you add timestamps of when you're speaking to your *pinned comment*. This way I can both skip ahead, and you still get your tidy chapter segments. Edit: I was also hoping for more information along the way. I would've happily watched the whole thing uninterrupted, if there had been more information along the way. Why is the Siderian called that, for example?
I can’t even comprehend a *million* years 😧
The soundtrack for this one will be insane
bill wurtz did it better
People who watched the whole thing:  👇
Glory to GOD in JESUS Name
Wait until he makes part 2 which covers the last 7.5 billion years of Earth's history from the present day all the way up to its destruction and engulfment by the sun.
Babe wake up 1 hour Kurzgesagt documentary just dropped
Man the music is awesome.. adding it to my gaming playlist.. Epic Mountain never fails me
I really want to to thank all the people that worked for this masterpiece from the bottom of my heart, it was a beautiful experience
Neat. Now do 1 Hour in 4.5 Billion Years.
"And the floor is lava"                               - Kurzgesagt ~4400 million years ago
Is The Sun a deadly laser?
* all of mainstream history
I'm still looking for that goofy clown's comment thag says "God created the earth and through him all life began" 🤡🤓
Don’t blink! It’s crazy how fast life has been moving ever since cells figured out how to cooperate!
So if each second is 1.5 million years that means that if you are watching this video in 60 fps (in 720p or higher) one video frame is 25 000 years, pretty crazy.  This also puts into perspective how big a BILLION is, let alone 4.5 BILLION YEARS.
THAT THUMBNAIL IS INSANE
1:00:43 - 1:00:44 Humanity You're welcome
Well so is gonna to be next human history?
This need to be in netflix <3
What a piece of work is a man, How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, In form and moving how express and admirable, In action how like an Angel, In apprehension how like a god, The beauty of the world, The paragon of animals.
Never thought seeing a 1hr kurzgesagt video would make so damn happy haha
I knew they were working on something big. 😂😮
Beautiful
I always wondered if someone was eventually gonna make something like Bill Wirtz did but on a bigger budget.  Hoping that one day someone makes a historical series like this
It's the Electronic Jam of the Holiday Season
whoever does the music doesn't get paid enough
Thank you Kurzgesagt for keep making us free interesting educational videos
so if you were to play the video at actual speed, it would advance a frame every 20,000 years or so.
Beautiful
29:43 startled me.
To thos thinking this took months to make and that this is such a fantastic video, actually no! It's crazy how far technology had advanced that something like this could be done in a few days. Probably 2 days. What's unfortunate are the long sections of lazy and repeated animation to pad the run time without actually giving any content. It's actually a shame to see how crappy this one video is compared to others.
Ooooooohhh buddy!  Just over an hour of existential crisis?  Yes please.
It feels weird to witness earth having no complex life for so long
that was an INCREDIBLE VIDEO!!!! the visualization of the timeline made it really sink in for me how new life really is. i knew before but it didnt really click yknow? also, you guys didnt have to go so hard on the music but its soooooo good! thank you guys so much for making this video :)
nobody is goning to talk about the sick soundtrack??!!, it goes hard 🔥🔥🔥. Animation and sound wise a real masterpice!!
Great job with the music! This video is an amazingly executed awesome idea
!
So amazing!!!
Holy cow I have found my new favorite album.
This is the best music video I have ever seen
It took only 1600 million years from multicellular life emerging to this video. Worth of waiting.
This was so cool 😎
Love this video! Thank you ❤
Great concept but was surprised by the lack of animation of things you mention during the video (ie. volcanos, mountain ranges forming, cells forming/merging)
AN HOUR LONG NUTSHELL VID ?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?  YES!!!! YEEEEEES!!!!!!
Atleast they say "we dont know" instead of making something up.
That was fantastic, thank you.
Greatest video ever
This is the best video to ever happen to me.
This is so goddamn chill it's cracking me up.
1 hour of high quality animation and music, for free, with barely any mid-roll ads... really shows the passion behind this channel and its goal of bringing knowledge to everyone. Thank you kurzgesagt ❤️
246 594th viewer :)
the music was so good
Bro, this video is so trippy and informative, lol
I missed some major details like the death of Harambe, but overall great video
This was so fascinating and very beautifully made ❤.
This is one of the most brilliant ideas for a video ever. It still doesn't allow me to fully grasp the unimaginable breadth of time covered, but it is the next best thing. Every second it self is an almost unthinkable amount of time.
Appreciate guys😮
This is so good I shared it on my work slack. Something I never, ever did. Wow.
paleoarchean thats where the shit started shtting
I❤ this channel you guys make it easy and informative
"History of the entire World" would be a better title, I guess.
Phenomenal
i don’t have 1 hour for 4.5 billion years
Watch out at 1:37 as you need to seek for higher ground!!!
Dinner plans just changed!
Nobody is gonna say you are to young and haven't experienced anything yet when you finish this video.XP
Amazing video!   Happy anniversary Kuzgesagt! Love your content ❤️
Goddamn
I want this as a screen saver
This is a MONSTER of a video and im so proud of you! The only thing better would have been if the guy who did "history of the entire world I guess" made a sneaky cameo
Good video!
Bill Wurtz did it in 20 minutes ;)
Kurzgesagt is no doubt the best YouTube channel out there.
fantastic work
44:58 ...
What an amazing ride this is
They didn't understand the 'Kurz' part of the name
29:43 Glitch
" Life hadn't started eating the sun yet" is a very metal line
The music is fantastic
genius way to give us a sense in scale of the true nature of time passing
Won't lie, leaving this in the background is surprisingly soothing-I might just put this on loop while working on something
I canot believe that something so perfect exists, everyone should watch this masterpiece❤️
Very cool I always enjoyed your guyes music
The periods without information are far too long and numerous, i have to skip to real content and i must be missing some good information, so much bandwidth wasted for all the people that are going to watch the hour long, please don't do that
Yo this soundtrack has mad stellaris vibes.
Makes me upset some people fully deny all of this
Love the music!
Love it!!!!
Glad to watch this vid on Friday evening. The music fits very well to my self beer-trance party)))
Visual glitch at 29:43
cool, rich people/corporate propaganda for the masses again.
We don’t fully understand how biochemicals work, we make drugs and usually don’t understand its mechanism, we can barely predict the weather correctly.. but we know exactly how the universe formed and what happened 4.5 billion years ago. Cute
And this is why we need to let him cook.
But they forgot god and all the Prophets/messiahs. Probably since different people have different beliefs. And they did not want to get Cancelled. 😂
should do one with mars or have Pluto's orbit to show how long its orbit is
This video makes me want to play Dyson sphere program again.
Actual footage of how quickly time passes after you have a child.
A 3 Hrs movie like this would be great! 🌅Would rather watch great visuals with a good soundtrack than any of that garbage Hollyweird and Disney throws out lately with $2-300M budgets.  Would be awesome for background movie too 📺
I burst into tears at the end, sad for the dinosaurs end and happy that life keeps going on. Thank you kurzgesagt for this wonderful video on an day where I am lying in bed with a cold, waiting for my fantastic immunsystem to help me recover.
“How about we do a one hour animation about Earth?” “Sure.” Famous last words for this well written and animated masterpiece. I can’t imagine the pride and depression they got from doing this.
the music!!!!! :D
Eoarchean: 'around this time, we think that life begins to enter the stage.' And techno. Like- SICK techno. 🐋
This is amazing!! Can you upload a version with no voice over? I'd leave this on in the background all the time
I can now tell people I saw the earth form  Thank you kurzgesagt
Anyone else take Big History in high school? I'm so glad to have known this kinda stuff for awhile
this was the best 1 hour i had all week, the feeling of seeing the history of animals resummoned a childhood obsession of my of history, amazing work
I miss the "The sun is deadly lazer" from bill wurtz video
i wish your video would be in 3D
Thank you everyone at Kurzgesagt, this was just brilliant! Your work truly make my curiosity grow!
“Life, uhh finds a way”
I can’t even FATHOM how long this took. An hour of beautifully done animation is a n incredible feat!
That's some efficient use of time.
Omg the level of details is insane
Damn
Nice video. Too bad they don't put the albums of the Ocean collective as background music. They have 4 concept albums with all the songs named after a geological era.
This has been the fastest hour of my life. Fascinating video. Loved the music and visuals.
What a brilliant video, it really highlights how human history is barely a blink of an eye in this hour long showcase of our planets existence.
I think it’s a nutshell if only you try to compare to the history of earth. Really break my mind just to thought that even a 10min video will take thousands or even more hours.
[insert head-bopping cat meme]
crazy, danke kurzgesagt
Wow, this must've taken forever
Amazing animation, and amazing music, love epic mountains music that they do!
Can someone make a condensed edition of this video by retaining all the commentary and speeding phases that are repetitive?
I don’t need a sleep time playlist anymore. Just this 🤩
wow, 10 years, such a good job! thank you kurzgesagt ❤
Well, this is new!
First time not fast-forwarding a 1 hour+ video on YT. Stunning video, absolute masterpiece and so well done! Kurzgesagt is always ahead of the game!
40:48 , that's wallpaper worthy
Great!
The Journey Of The Earth
Now we need the 10 Hour Version! :D
Wow. That is all I can say. I never expected to see a 1 hour video
🔥the universe’s electro music track 🔥
man, gods weeks be taking a whole lot more than a week
this is cool
This is literally mind blowing! Props to them for this amazing hour long video
19:43 kinda sounds like doom metal
This is so good!
The person in charge of the soundtrack deserves a raise
58:12 Life uh...finds a way. You really spared no expense on that video! 🤣
❤
You know we are talking about Deep Time, when even *Kurz*gesagt needs 1 hour of our time to explain it. 🤗  Still just 26 minutes in, watching the exponential function developing in real time. ☺  Edit: Yup, that is a Like. 🥰
Excellent
Huge shout-out to the kurzgesagt team for this video and to the bacteria who invented sex!
The floor is lava!
There is so much to talk about this video, there are so many hidden things and facts you notice, remember and link up from across Youtube and the internet and everything you have learnt, and even if the video is silent and slow, your brain sort of fills in the gaps and puts everything you personally know into them. Spoilers below, I want you to watch the video and make your own observations before reading mine.  1. The contrast between this video and bill wurtz's history of the world is amazing. This video is much more relaxed, slow paced (until the final few eras). Bill does an amazing job, and his video is supercharged, superfast and you have to pay very close attention and know a lot of things beforehand already.  Note: I am looking at this video from a naturalist perspective, so the further observations might have some bias, so take any opinions with a grain of salt.  2. This video, particularly the multiple asteroid bombardments, ice ages and asteroid strikes in the Orosirian (33:48) and the Cretaceous (59:45) make me think of Fermi's Paradox and the Great Filter solution to the Fermi Paradox, how there are so many different things that might be a filter to life, and then to intelligent life.   3. Early forms of life (RNA, perhaps) begins around 8:30, then better unicellular life 12:40, and around 18:00 we get Photosynthesis, but it takes until 39:43 to get to Eukaryotes, which are still unicellular. 44:53 we get SEX! But we only get multicellular life until 52:55 and then the Cambrian explosion (remember the jingle from bill wurtz? Also the Evodevo song from AcepellaScience)  Imagine watching a 1 hour movie but the plot only starts at minute 53? And the twist happens at 59:46? That's one crazy movie. For all the people who claim that it is HIGHLY unlikely for life to form out of random chance, I ask you, if you were playing the lottery every second with millions of molecules for 3 billion years, why wouldn't you win it?  3.5. Hey, don't forget the Great Oxygenation event happened at 27:50 in the Siderean.  4. Visually, for me, the Calymmian Era is the best. Which one did you like?   5. I haven't watched the video enough to give a fair judgement on the best soundtrack, but I think Mesoarchean slaps. Although there might be better ones I forgot or missed.  6. It's so funny to know the names of all eras after the Cambrian, having heard and read it so many times all over the science side of the internet.   7. It is bizzare to think the Hadean Era was just asteroid rain, where each second we wait, the Earth waited for 1.5 million years. More than humanity has lived, EACH SECOND. Surreal.  8. If you pause fast enough you can see the things inside the living beings in the Neoarchean. That's cool.  9. Some of the Eras feel like Sci-fi planets from some verses. And they last for millions of years. Makes me wonder if all the planets described in Halo/StarWars/StarTrek/DoctorWho/WH40K are just in one of the phases of the planet's evolution. Maybe some of the exoplanets we see today are in their early or late stages of life. Maybe that's the answer (The Not enough time has passed solution to the Fermi Paradox) as to why we don't see planets with habitable life. Earth itself looked like an alien, inhospitable planet for so long.  10. The Cryogenian freezes multiple times, reminding me of how bill wurtz said that the earth 'froze multiple times, probably'.  I also noted some interesting tidbits, and I want myself to be corrected on this if I am wrong:  a. We depart from the moon in the Hadean Era around 7:00 and we don't see it until 37:23 in the Statherian Era. Then lose it about 42:00 in the Calymmian. We see a Crescent moon at 58:46 in the Cretaceous Era, then disappears at 59:07. I don't see it after this. b. We see the sun first at 17:55 in the Paleoarchean and depart from it in 23:20 in the Mesoarchean, then Calymmian 42:08 to 47:00 in the Stenian Era. I don't see the sun after this. c. I kind of want to also make a list of all Eras underwater and overwater, but that is too much work right now 😔😔 d. The Eoarchean 8:10 is the first Era he doesn't say the name of. I expected it to be later. e. The Ordovician 54:17 is the first Era without any introduction or even any commentary. f. I also want to mark all of the supercontinents, but I forgot where they were... Pangea is about 56:45  I want to come back and find more things about this video later. Thanks so much @kurzgesagt!
....
Earth had a pretty cool soundtrack.
how much did this take
Just think about it. The fact that you exist is because of the culmination of these events. All of these things had to happen for you to exist. Life is so precious and beautiful and so is our planet
Siderean: whoooooaaah bubbles!!
ssooo cool !!! excellent job
Another video that never fails to amaze us. Love you Kurzgesagt 💖❤
What can I say? This video got more than 15000 likes while I watched it. If that doesn't say enough about it, I don't know what would.
Thanks bro, I have an F in history but I should be good for the final now 😄
Wow This is the most ambitious video I've seen all year at least... Incredible
I thought i was tripping, duck is everywhere
29:43 Compression glitch at the bottom :/
1 hr yessir
Amazing
A MASTERPIECE
Right Here, Right Now - director's cut
no this started 4 years ago holy crap
Neoarchean: oooehhh bubbles
that's crazy
This needs a 10 hour version obviously
Wow they realy must have sacrificed a lot of time on this
Camera man is crazy fr.
my new screen saver boutta be crazy
But the water came from meteors?
Bro thinks he's Bill Wirtz 💀
Thank you.
I this that have videos like that for free is the more insane things with this channel So much time spent on animations, subjects and writing, and this is always an absolute pleasure to watch ❤
This video left me with a ton of questions. Mostly its just "Why?"
stop your tiktok scrolling, just watch it, all the way, fight the urge to just 'scroll'.
4.5 billion years later and gta 6 isnt released
We all love you Kurzgesagt, never stop doing what you’re doing!
Ok, is there please a cut of just the interesting bits? 1 hour is great and all, but I don't want to miss the bits with detail. That I will, when there's an hour with audio void.
My tablet is on 4% battery charge when I made it to the end its the best passion project I have ever seen
Time to take some booms and settle in.
Damn man Best channel in the whole platform 👏
How many other civilizations could have existed in the span of those 90 million years at the start of the video, where Earth was just a lava ball in space.
This by far the best video you have made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Happy 10 years anniversary Kurzgesagt! 🎉 Thank you for being so awesome ❤
Absolutely amazing, this level of attention to detail is why people always come back to this channel. How long this took to render I don't wanna know!
Be honest guys...how many of you found yourselves doing Bill Wortz qotes? "taste the suuuuun~" or "Nooo the sun is a deadly lazer!"
One second here is 1.5 million years on earth
I honestly think the best way to express Earth's history is logarithmically. Sure, events like the formation of life take a while on a geological time scale, but human history (which is just as interesting) is so minuscule that we have to slow down to truly appreciate it. This is exactly what Bill Wurtz did this in his video, and we all know how well that turned out.  Great work as always Kurzgesagt. Even with my nitpicking you can't deny this must've taken a lot of effort.
Wow
Por favor, legendem em português essa obra prima
Wait.. I gonna get my coffee while watching this good show.
❤❤❤
Props to the cameraman sticking around for so long to capture this masterpiece
It's worth the 3 weeks of wait
Please please please upload the soundtrack for this <3<3<3<3
This is undoubtedly the best video in YouTube history.
very very powerful! I really love it! There is so much effort put into this piece!
Nothing could have prepared me for an hour long Kurzgesagt video
29:43 found a glitch there. Still great video, Kurzgesagt Team!
Holy moley.
先赞再看
kurzgesagt: the movie  Edit: As I'm watching this, it just blows my mind how much of everything had to go exactly how it did for you and I to be here watching this video.
Kurzgesagt had 4.5 billion years of footage. They cut so much of it, down to an hour in an effort to achieve perfection. Clearly, CGP Grey was involved in development.
Video starts at 53:00
The soundtrack to this video reminds me of the Risk of Rain 2 soundtrack a lot. I love it
Happy 10 years!! <3 Thank you for alll your effort and the knowledge you bestow upon us every day ^^
WOW! This is amazing! The only way to reduce ignorance is through boosting interest in science and this video doing it wonderfuly!
Thanks so much to all the incredible people who make these videos, it has truly been a journey and while I certainly haven't been here for all of it I massively appreciate all of the work you guys have put into it, love the channel love the work you guys do! ❤❤❤❤
Bill wurtz did it in 19 minutes and 52 seconds. This is so much worse at compressing information.
I sat here mesmerized for a whole hour, and I loved every 1.5 million years of it. Thank you all so much for this and all the knowledge and joy you bring us!
If I felt something? I did! put it in perspective like this... it really moves something inside. great work!
This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen on Youtube. I's wanna share it to everyone I know, but sadly few people are able to appreciate such beauty.
This video is impossible
Yooo hold up imma need a popcorn while watching this
I love this
Water exists at all temperatures
This is by far the longest and best video yet🔥
The outro music was so good. So was the video itself everything was great keep up all the good work 👍
This is why i love kurzgesagt. There art style is so amazing and they take time for there vewers! Had to buy from there shop. I recomand too
Bro I just watched the normal documentary version of this last night. Now I gotta watch the animated version
whos still watching after 1906 million years
1:36
A wonderful journey.
Didn't watch, can someone sum it up for me
i have work later (dreading it) but i was VERY pleasantly surprised with this this has given me an odd motivation and i am so happy that there's a new video to fixate on and listen to for background noise whenever i need it major props to everyone who worked on this, it is absolutely insane that people can animate this kind of stuff and it's a talent i strive to have one day. absolute goals as an artist.
I watched the entire thing (2x speed of course)
Daymm
RAIN FROM WHERE!
@45:25 is giving strong Tool vibes  And again @47:06
This would be fantastic to have as a wallpaper engine background
Crazy, it's like a movie of what my parents way to school looked like
Now i feel really old
Surely, the Moon wasn't tidally locked from the start.
I like this, if you guys can make more of these please do.
The people that disliked the video are the creationists that don't believe the earth is older than 6,000 years
The thought of all this passing before we existed is hard to grasp. Also the fact that time will continue to pass after we die is a scary subject.
hello
29:40 A glitch within the Matrix. Lol
2019-2023 thats some dedication right there for this one video and we all apricate it.
Thanks you so much for Kurzgesagt for making this master piece. ❤
Thanks fam
That was great! I know it might sound farfetched but I'm looking forward to for a Life or Humanity hour timeline!
did they thank for this guy, bill wurtz? Because I've caught few references to his history of world
Being an animator myself i have immense respect for the animation team.. Ik the pain behind every minute pop in the video... Huge huge props to the team.. Big hug for you to make this for people to be inspired for no cost
top tier video⭐⭐
This may sound inconsiderate, but I would a second version without the narration.  Just for the replayability and having a nice music & visualiser to throw on a screen while hanging out.
What an amazing vibe. Would have loved more talk , but super awesome
This music is fire
This is art.
Me: this is taking so long! The guy who went trough the 1 billion year long the floor is lava game:
31:30 1.5X speed the song be hittin'
That Hadean drop had me like 💃💃💃
YOOOOOOo
You guys should make an app like the macro micro app with this info ... but the beggining is the big bang.   Edit: The parts with long waiting time, you can put a nice song . Or compress more the time.
41:16 fungi buisness
Моя пошана аніматорам! Це неймовірне відео. Мене захоплюють масштаби роботи. Не можу навіть уявити скільки сил та часу пішло на створення цього відео, і воно заслуговує великого визнання.  Дякую усій команді за це круте відео
And god created the heavens and the earth 🥲😂
I love how the earth went through every extreme possible, before stabilizing like, “ya gotta know the rules before you break the rules”
i enjoy every bit of this channel . keep up the crazy work!
Fun fact: From the point where the moon was formed in the video, you can actually see the moon gradually move further and further away until the point we see the first human, great attention to detail!
An hour Kurzgesagt episode! 😮
I wonder how many hours they spend on making this video?
You did a good job to put modern life into perspective of all life. I think to do it justice, it should be about 4000 hours long and commit 10000x the display you made to cover everything just enough to scratch the surface. However, that's not realistic. However, that is what is realistic. Interesting.
When I first saw the duration I was flabbergasted. Huge love for Kurzgesagt❤
Might be one of the best videos I ever watched. It is beautifully made and illustrate history in such a great way.
Incredible video and research as always
God be like: "Six days my ass, do you have any idea how long it took just to set the canvas up?!"
Shoutout to all those who spend 4.5 billion years working on this video
Saving this for when I'm stoned😊, bg tracks, visuals all align
Lava
We need this playlisttttttttttttttttttt
Am I the only one who gets overwhelmingly proud of life on earth? From the first cell in the oceans, that's our common ancestor. Life has lived and died, evolved and survived for billions of years to bring us individuals here today. Theres is something powerful there that no words could ever explain.
Where's the cat-head-bob gif when you need it? Cause you could play that alongside this entire video.
I still can't believe that content like this is given out for free, FANTASTIC work guys. Thank you all!
Man they had some great tunes back in the day huh
very very good video
How the hell we could terraform Mars😢 jesus christ.. we will probably create bigger iss first
This is one of the finest videos on YouTube, ❤ It took 4.5 billion years to reach this point in animation and video logging to have this released at this point of space time !!!! ✌️
Now i know how it feels to live for 4.5 B years in Flash walking speed🤣Technically we just live longer than any vampire that exist🤣
this video singlehandedly rejuvenated my attention span
insane
I'm awe-induced by the animations and how beautifully it shows the transition as we travel in a timeline. Kurzgesagt truly has unmatched dedication considering they've been working on this insane project of animations since 2019! Just Insane, Thank you!
I dont normally watch long videos at all,but i wont hesitate to watch this one
this was an incredible experience. thanks fo you all s2
How fasitidious it must have been to make! Thank you very much for this beautiful and humbling journey fellow humans 😊
Wow!
First billion was 🔥🐐
Yes lets go
should sell the soundtrack instead of your usual fare with this video
why after the ice age more complex life formed?
This video is amazing, I love trying to understand how long the earth truly is
The worst part is YouTube interrupting the jam session with ads nobody watches.
To think, sex was invented by a bunch of cells about 1180 million years ago, yet so many multicellular people never get an ounce of it.
The Earth Lore is deep and most of all.. amazing.
I'm mesmerized❤
This is massive. Standing ovation no less 👏👏👏
I love this so much, took me 10 million years just to write this comment!
Absolutely love this!
Que trabalho incrível!
"sometime in the Ectas- 1.4 billion years ago"
1 hour here is 4.5 billion years on Earth…
With this quality of animation. This deserves more likes and views. Great job.
Oh my gawd…this is so cool, I appreciate the time and dedication this took to make! 🌎🪐☀️⏰
Ah I can't get over how many extinction events have taken out all life. I just wish we could see all of those species that no longer exist! Just imagining the possibilities is nuts.
This is one of the coolest things I have seen. Thanks
What's cool is the countdown in the top right. Everything will be nature for 4499 years - and then suddenly, in that final blip, everything we know appears.  The earth is old. Life is old. We're one line in this story.
Thank you.
❤
Wow 👏 i love this
this video absolutely fucking rules... just wow..
Bro just casually dropped Earth Lore - Updated ver. 2023 like a new season just came out
just watching and vibing while listening to that music
Billion years of forming, millions and millions of years of evolution. And we are wittnessing all of it in a fraction of a second. How dare we to put our feet on this planet and litteraly trash it
Pretty sure they didn't have techno-drone music during the Hadean. Just sayin
Congrats for the anniversary!!! This video was beautiful!  Keep up with the great work! Greetings from Buenos Aires.
I absolutely love it. ten minutes in and I want to watch it forever. just the thing I needed today ❤ and absolute respect to the people behind it! the music, the animation, everything is just breathtaking. thank you! ❤
This music is quite the vibe. I would pay for it without the commentary.
A true masterpiece was released today. This will be enjoyed for decaded to come at least.
The music somehow made a slideshow extremely epic
r/praisethecameraman for making it out!
Wow, just watched it in full. Great job to everyone whom worked on it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Waiting for this kind of episode! Now i can sleep!
Commenting for the algorithm. Amazing piece of work. Published 1h ago, 1h length, 200K views already, this says a lot.
Take that Bill Wurtz
This is the best channel on YouTube
The music goes so hard
Earth lore full:
You should make this a screensaver
a 1 h vid by kurzgesagt? man thats awsome
Those are some epic video game backgrounds.
went on to youtube- was praying and hoping for ANY new media. There, on the top left feed corner, first in line- OMG Kurzgesagt have ANOTHER video out. Nice. THANK YOU!🐋🐳😄
In spite of this there are humans who threaten other humans with extinction
This. Shit. Slaps.
This is why this is the best Science channel. And I recommended it to all the science-loving students of mine. 👍
8:30, soooo, where does this water come from ?
so basically vast majority of earths history is quite boring ;)
(:
I do love it! It is a wonderful video I enjoyed every second, thanks a lot! 😅
Terraforming Earth by God
amazing
This is crazy 😮! ONE HOUR!!! of a Kurzgesagt video that must have taken forever to make. Wow 👍
Yoh this music though🔥
Kurzgesagt the movie
The animation is great but the music is sick too
I LOVE this so much! I can't explain how happy I am that you made this video! I've always tried to visualize the history of earth and the universe through a rough timelines on paper, and there's never enough space on paper to distinguish multicellular life, it's just so recent compared to earth and the universe. It's amazing to see just how long it takes stuff to happen, just tiny progress unseen to the naked eye for a long time, and then BAM suddenly you get an explosion of interesting stuff and diversity everywhere! It's so fascinating. Thank you so much for making this, and happy 10th anniversary! ♥️
This is perfect for work today 🤓
sounds like there are Tool fans on Kurzgesagt team
THIS MUSIC BUMPING THE WHOLE TIME!!!!!!!!
AN HOUR KURZGESAGT VIDEO?????? YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thank you so much, what a masterpiece guys and gals ❤ Grateful for this vid!
Just sitting here during my lunch hour, eating a whole pizza I ordered from the grocery store, watching earth from birth. Aight.
Love and Appreciate your Hard work ❤🎉
19:44 Hell yeah! Doom music’s approaching
Tf is this. One hour of Animation. Well respect👏👏👏👏👏👏
Cameraman always lives
One of the best animated YouTube videos I’ve ever seen. Well done.
This was a fantastic watch! Worth spending an hour watching ^^
So blessed to have an hour of Kurzgesagt to enjoy today, I'd fork over some cheese to have this animation as a desktop background.
I fucking love this channel
The sheer effort that has been put into this project baffles me, and the fact that its completely free for everyone to see. Thank you Kurzgesagt for everything you guys do
Amazing.
Ah yes, Ausfuhrlich - In Long
I found my study playlist for the year
The background is so epic, I am studying and for some reason I am enjoying studying whilst watching this!
This was a great video, the history of Earth and the Universe is so fascinating
Animating an hour is alot
What a great way to celebrate your 10th anniversary! Happy anniversary Kurzgesagt.. Wishing you guys many amazing years ahead 🥳🎊
this is incredible
Hi it's been a while
One of the greatest🎉
The Mesoarcheon Music (starting at around 20:00) gives off Hades Soundtrack vibes
The best video ever, thank you soo much
is there a way to make this video run as wallpaper on my desktop?
Amazing work Thank you all
👏... 👏 .. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This absolutely can't happen all by it self without a designer.
reeaally good the soundrack at 24:24, do you know the name?
Where did the water for the rain at the beginning of the Eoarchean suddenly come from?!
Could you release a no commentary version of this? I don’t mind the narrator, but this would be awesome to relax to.
Shout-out to my homie bangiomorpha pubescens for inventing sex
Wow. Just Wow.
You really are the best
the sun is a deadly lazer
You should release a soundtrack please
This guy is a teacher with 1,000,000,000 hours of experience
holy f* that is a long kurzgesagt video. Can't wait to watch it
Wait, banger music? 😅
Just imagine if on such grand timescales, humans somehow evolved just a million years earlier... where would we be now, or perhaps not even there? Wild to think how little time periods on such large scales can have such profound impacts.
"The atmosphere is mostly co2, and the floor is lava." 😂❤
When he said “which forms the moon” all I heard was the “which is now the moon 🎶” jingle from Entire History of the World I guess
The music is really well done in this
Wonderful video, but also a slap on the face on how insignificant one life spawn is
This is fantastic.   Thank you for making this, making it beautiful to look at, and with stunning music
omgomgomgomg
Nah im watching for 30 minutes, *sets video to 2x speed.* Madmen watching the video at .25x speed be like (:<
Truly one of my favourite topics by one of my favourite YouTube channels
You guys are amazing. This video made me realize how amazing humanity is, given how little time relatively we've had on earth and how much we've changed it. I love humanity
Best time travel machine ever!
this channel has the most charming animation on Youtube for sure
Incredible!
oh cool Kurzgesagt uploaded a new timeline video this should be a cool quick deviation from work *looks at runtime* *re-reads title* oh great heavens
Wow
omg this is sooo amazing. thanks so much
an hour long Kurzgesagt video?? is this a dream?
wow! 4 years of animation! Huge congrats on managing to finish this for your 10th anniversary. I hope everyone can appreciate this as much as i have just did right now. And great job as usual!
Kort sagt making a one hour movie! Love It!
You made my friday :)
Marvelous.... thank you
Love the music! Thanks for this video!!
This is so lovely. Totally worth watching😇😃😄😄
Really interesting video concept and I love the experiment with something so long-form. Would love more stuff like this from Kurzgesagt
How this channel has less then 7.8 billion subscribers will always astound me
Sublime 💕
Was waiting for this video for ages!
Hey, why can I play this picture-in-picture on my phone? I don’t have YT Premium.
Makes you appreciate the world we have, channels like this one keeps science alive. I love it
this is the best "history of the world/universe" video since "history of the entire world, i guess"
One of the best channels on yt!
briliant
A fail by the writing team.  Not very interesting graphics, not very interesting sound track, which would be fine if there were some interesting information being presented, like why were there different ages, what happened to distinguish them from each other, what interesting things happened during these periods.  But no, just long stretches of boring nothing.  Do better.
Binged the whole. Never looked away
As a child I used to fantasize of living forever just to see the world change and evolve. This is a dream come true. Sort of. Thank you so much Kurzgesagt!
The riff starting at 19:40 gives some major Tool vibes. Amazing video!
Who else thinks this music is 🔥
#
On of the greatest🎉
Shoutout 13:46, turn on captions :)
An hour of kurzgesagt is truly amazing. ❤️
Amazing
Incredible
is satherian extinction?
This may be one of the most important videos on the entire internet, period.
Watching these mass extinctions gives me hope in a strange way, that even if most of life and species were to be wiped out they would always reemerge in similar or even greater variety.
Someone should list every single species of anything that you can see in this video :D
An hour long kurgesagt video? Excuse me? What did we do to deserve such a blessing?!
41:40 "Do fun guy things"
Right now I am feeling like a God watching the creation.  I am definitely watching earth’s creation at Godly timescales 😂
1 hour video? This is gonna be epic journey
Amazing for studying!!
The amount of work put into this one is staggering. Thanks Kurzgesagt for all your work especially this masterpiece! This should be used by schools as a material. Really puts into perspective how short lived and insignificant yet special and powerful we are.
This is so cool! I can tell I'll be using it a lot
"Good job if you are still watching."
Slowest falling fireballs of all time. Took a damn near million years for each one to fall to the surface!
I don't know why you guys bothered to explain all of history when The Barenaked Ladies already did it in 2 minutes
This is easily the coolest YouTube and Kurzgesagt video that has ever been uploaded. This channel is better than Vyvanse.
cosmic code running billions of years beta testing that everything works ;)
Who need lofi beats when you have the entire history of the earth to study and chill to
Boy oh boy, what a bunch of toddlers we are. shortest one hour youtube video for a long time. well done.
I think this would be a real fun watch at the local planetarium.
"Guess the Cambrian's pretty early on then huh"  *Checks timestamp*  53 minutes. What.
Probably the ultimate Kurzgesagt video
Good job on 20'000'000 subs!
ill probably be using this as a way to fall asleep from now on, this is great
This is beautiful, I’m only 15 minutes in and I’m incredibly mesmerized by the music and animation, I have a deep desire to experience it first hand.
1 hour of kurzgesagt? AMAZING!
This video is absolutely incredible. Congratulations to all the team for the amazing and surely extremely hard work!!
After 3 billion years in development, Earth has finally invented sex. Well done, Earth
this would be an amazing screensaver.
Im looking forward how you handled the music with this one. Id be so, so down to hear this basically be a kinda evolving conceptual album.
This is awesome.  Well done!
To było niesamowite!
Absolutely awesome! Great work, kurzgesagt!
This is beautiful. Happy 10th anniversary 🎉🎉🎉
it is so crazy that our time is just a speck in comparison to earths
The Earth is 7500 years old.
💥THE SUN IS A DEADLY LASER💥
59:25 I think I hear the Time/Life leitmotif???
A dinosaur took up 5x the amount of time as ALL OF HUMANITY. makes you think.
I can certainly say that the team has gone insane
Where's the purple stuff?
Ahhh that’s why it’s an hour. Oh well.  Still a nice soundtrack in the background
fucking goated
I keep thinking that the Narrator is the brain behind all the science stuff because they sound genuine and smart
saw the video thought "damn a whole hour . I will put this on in the back ground." And then watched every second of it with my full attention and loved it. the music was amazing the voice over was amazing and the art was amazing.
ASMR!❤
Imagine the look on the faces of illustrators and editors when they heard that the next project is to animate the entire 4.5 billion year history of earth.
Just finished watching, keep up the good work!
Documenting my time here:  Edit: The fact that life came about so early is crazy and concerning  Edit 2: The music is slapping  Edit 3: at 29:42, the rocks glitch that's funny   Edit 4: ayo we jus gonna skip over the oceans turning red 😭 cmon that's like the fun thing abt the oxidation event  Edit 5: hit the Rhyacian. What happened. The anti-aliasing on all the rocks disappeared, it looks like it was made in ms paint... this is concerning  Edit 6: VERDEFORT IMPACT STRUCTURE LESS GOOOOO  Edit 7: 37:00 oh ok... oh that's cool....

20:00 Doom Music Intensifies
I am waiting for the next 4.5 billion years.
Bill Wurtz gone science
Big thanks to animation team!
Makes me nostalgic for the good old times back in the Mesoarchean period when all life was was just chilling in a hot tub and vibing. Nowadays we have things like taxes. And other people.
I felt like doing drugs watching this
I would 100% watch a 4 hour version of this that shows all 13.8 billion years of our universe.
This was simply amazing
Watching this video is so cool while also thinking about venus and mars. They are both examples of what earth could've become if things did not go right, yet here we are. We have an amazing, beautiful planet, and we need to take care of it ❤
Wow, my mind feels bigger 😅
53:14        1:00:39       1:00:43
I would recommend having someone talking the whole time also you did a good job on the MOVIE
Watched the entire thing even the credits. Licked the plate, no crumbs left 😂. Love every minute (1Million yrs)
Global Warming is our way of saying "f these billions of years of progress, time to get back to the Hadean Era!"
The visuals as always are great, but the music! By the gods, the music was perfect! Each 4-beat lasting exactly 5 million years, perfectly pacing the time elapsing, and with each era having its own musical leitmotifs and all in a continual DJ mix - if they give awards for music in web videos, this should win it.   One quibble - we go around the Milky Way once every quarter-billion years or so, and there would have been some changes to the star field and some supernovae happening. I'd have had the star background scroll when that was on display, have the occasional star appear, have the occasional star go out in a massive explosion in the sky. Even if it were three layers moving at slightly different speeds, that would have scratched an itch for me. But I'm complaining about something that must have taken months to plan and produce. Just the idea of using a Voronoi diagram at 23:20 to animate the surface of the sea, little touches like that, were beautiful.
So glad I wasn't born 4,308 million years ago.
mongus
Watching the hadeon period, it's clear Jupiter was slacking in it's job.
+1
This channel is actually insane
45:04 This is why onlyfans exist
4.5 billion years in an hour. Yeah thats about how the last 3 years felt... 😂
Just finished and now my TV is drifting right in my vision 😂
I see this being rewatched an indefinite number of times since this is the genra of vids i put while both sleeping and studying. Plus it s free and from my favorit channel on youtube❤❤❤. I feel an Undescribable happiness  for this gift❤❤❤.
Peak Kurzgesact
47:43 I'll continue it tomorrow (¬､¬)
One hour animation is impossible to do in one day how did he do🗿
Incredible
THIS IS SO COOL
O-Okay, i bend myself, that's fucking amaizing.
This is literally the best study background one could ask for thank you so much 🙏
Kurtzgesagt once again coming in clutch for stoners
Now make a 3-hour video in the same vein, but about the entire timeline of the universe.
Now I can proudly say that im 4billion yrs old xD
The first 13m of the video reminded me so much of one of the segments in Disney's Fantasia "Rite of Spring" where, of course, it's shows the birth of earth and all of life!  I just think it's so fascinating to see the history of earth be told in many different ways of art, shape and form. And Kurtzgesagt does that so beautifully well 😊
My lord that's crazy
amazing 😮
hell yeah
Thanks to Epic Mountain for the awesome vibes of the soundtrack!
We could made a religion out of this...
😲
time well spend
like anyone knows what was going on billions of years ago, get over yourselves
I think I need to speed it up to 3.000.000 yps...
Hey i think if you dubbing the audio like mr beast, you will reach much more audience, also I'm easy to understand 😂
19:40 holy shit it djents
I admire your hard work
soundtrack goated animation sleek narration good  BEST VIDEO  KURTZ
"it's still much hot and *comfy* " if you say so
Still can't believe how life has evolved into us by such chance!! Awesome video!
this is mindboggling. we all thank you so much for making this long of content for free. 💜
the theia collision made me jump not gonna lie
Thank you ❤
loved every second
Its crazy how much is just nothing but rocks, the cambrian dosent even happen till nearly the end of the video
I could now imagine one about humanity, either from the beginnig of the hominini tribe, the homo group, or just homo sapiens, showing our expansion across the map, with commentary on technological and historical breakthroughs
this is so good omg omg
beautiful.
The animators missed their children growing up to make this
I had always hoped for a video like this.
Bravo Thomas Veith & Fabian Glaser!! What an excellent musical performance
Naturally, humans are the only ones who notice they are being filmed. And they only get 1 second, if that.
DUDE.... an hour long video from kurzgesagt?! Yo this is a blessing from god
People pay for garbage shows and movies and what not, and here's kurzgesagt making educational and high production value animated video's for all of us to see, for free.  You've got yourself a new patreon member🙂
Goob Job :)
One hour is not really "kurz gesagt" but relative to 4.5 billion years it is.
this was very cool! though too distracting to work while it was one, i did manage to make er through! i would definitely watch the prequel: big bang to earth forming, or the sequel: now to the sun eating the planet!! obviously the coolest would be a zoom in of the last 10 000 years, but i cant imagine that would be viable youtube product with the added animation.
"In the Stenian Era, not much was going on…” 😴 “Except they invented sex.” 🤩
I wish the asteroid the killed the dinosaurs never existed
This is your best video yet!!!
the music is amazing
That was longer than I expected
History of everything I guess finally has some competition
The Earth: lava hellscape The cameraman: _groovin_
I'm going to put this on for bed so I can have an existential crisis in my dreams every night
So the history of the entire world, I guess
Hats off for the efforts that went into this
😃😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩WOOOOOOW 4.5 Billion Thank yous for this 🙏🐉👶🧒👦🧑👨🧔‍♂️👨‍🦳🦏🦣🦖🐠🐟🐋🦑🦐🐙🦀🐌🦋🪱🪷☘️🌿🪴🌾
Next up: the age of the universe. All 13.7 billions years of its history.
Now we need this as an 10-hour video without the narration just music :D
Love the background trance music
Truly Masterpiece 👏👏👏
Started thinking it was a music video! 😂🎧🎶
THIS IS INCREDIBLE
We all won the lottery just being here, alive
Nice job!
This is the perfect Diwali gift from Kurzgesagt! 🔥
The history of the entire earth, I guess.
Hats off to Kurzgesagt team for this magnificent 1 hour video. Hats off! 🎉
Huge respect for Kurzgesagt
Brilliant concept and execution! You guys are killing it.
Interesting video concept I definitely enjoyed it.  My only critique is how annoying the soundtrack was
what happened at 29:43?
Just blink and you have missed 1.5 million years of Earth's History
This hour of my life is called happiness, thank you for this and all the people involved.
How many billion years to animate this? WOOOOOW
Let's say you were a god and decided to fast foward earth's time to get from earth's birth to us here in 2023. And let's say, also, that you wanted to enjoy the passage of time, and make it so your journey would last a year. It means that every second of your time travelling journey would be equivalent to 143 YEARS for earth. This is how fucking long it took for us to get here.
Goddamn…the music in this video….wos
1 HOUR UPLOAD. WE EATING GOOD TONIGHT
One of the few videos I won't be watching at 3x speed.
I ate a bagel during this and it’s probably the most existential bagel ill ever have
1hour video!!! OMG I must be dreaming
this will now be my background video from now on
An HOUR of Kurzgesagt? Yes, please!
you guys are the best. thank you for this.
58:50 This part looks beautiful imo
1 hour gang 👇
Wow. I bet the trilobites saw you animating this- I can’t imagine the time and effort this took!
Paleoarcheon dance party
The musical train thing killed me 💀
Ima find out how to make a video this long my screensaver, it's fantastic-looking  Also need to find out if I can add the audio
WATCH THE ADS EVERYONE. They deserve it!
YOOOOOOOOO
ah yes himstory
Really drives home how new humans are on the geological scale. All of it happened in just the last second of the one hour video.
Everyone like this they worked super hard on this! Happy tenth Anni!!!!🎉
spectacular, this would be amazing as a screen saver, it would be amazing to have this and see it all the time, amazing work
POR FAVOR, TRADUSCAN ESTE VIDEO AL ESPAÑOL. ES ESPECTACULAR. LOS AMO!!!!
44:52 Shoutout to banjomorphopubescence for inventing sex
this made me start studying, thank you
'history of the entire world, i guess' 2 just dropped.
this is so cool! can’t imagine how much time it took to make this
Buying merchandise on this channel has huge return on investment.
It's a bit strange to comprehend that for billion years there were no multicellular organisms on earth. it was just microbes or nothing
Time to get the popcorn guys.
Fun fact, queen Elizabeth was the one who recorded all of this o7
This is peak Kurzgesagt - in a nutshell. Successfully summing up 4.5 billion years into an hour. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙇🙏
Epic.
I have been looking for EXACTLY this kind of video for YEARS. I love the history of the planet itself and this is just perfect in every way. Thank you guys for all amazing work that went into making this ❤❤
I'm currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.

I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
Truly Mind-Blowing. Thank you, Kurzgesagt team for your effort.
Great music
Banging soundtrack
Thank you all
They really dont teach us properly in school. Humans are only a blink on the timeline. Its crazy.
Bring your glowsticks for this one boys
I love how this puts things into perspective, I've always been told how long/short these time periods were but this really makes you feel it
Good job 👍
woaw
Such a cool idea for a video!
45:00 something def going on
Im getting chills :) you guys rock so hard :D
This is the history of the world i gues
Why is this free? This should cost money, yet you are willing to give it for free. I turned off my Adblocker for this :)
as the observable universe accelerates and ages are calculated from constant veocity most things are likely older than we think  (infinite acceleration eliminates time --> time is inertia )
Digital fusion soundtrack for an hour long video or an hour of animated music video for a digital fusion album?
wow that was such an amazing and beautiful video.
Well done to the cameraman who captured this jk this video is amazing
I wanna see this be turned into a game
THE FLOOR IS LAVA
But the question is;  Is the sun a deadly lazer?
4.5 billion of years, cameraman 🗿
I bet that whoever did the music is a tool fan. At least all the rocky parts are a bit tooly...
Life uh finds a way. You just had to site Ian Malcolm🤣🤣🤣 the most amazing thing of all is that life has survived 5 major extinctions and are still kicking. That shows how hard life is to wipe out completely
1 hour of kurgesagt? let's goooooo!
This is so cool, any chance you could upload a narration free version for really just backround play?
I loved every second of this. The music, the visuals just everything. So cool and humbling to see
Lovely!
I love this so much, I love history and this will just give me so much information, even with only a tiny bit of talking time to time.
I love that the music changes
I'm super stoked to watch this tonight! An hour of kurzgesagt? Yes please
Every second just becomes more and more unfathomable.  I wonder what the next second after us will look like 😅.
Humans arive late and want the front row. How rude!
I made it passed 1.Billon years 3.5 more to go.
1:36 THE FLOOR IS LAVA?
THE FLOOR IS LAVA🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🌋🌋 01:36
Hi, you're on a rock floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? Some of it's water. Actually, most of it's water. I can't even get from here to there without buying a boat. It's sad. I'm sad. I miss you. How did this happen?
Magnum opus!
awesome, but a missed opportunity to make the music 90 bpm, so that every beat is 1 million years
Wow huge video
thanks but can we get something like this video with human Era added ?
Epic sound tracks bro
AN HOUR OF KURZGESAGT?
Brilliant, I loved it.
I can't tell you how much important this will be for everyone of all ages to watch for years to come, this might kurzgesagt's best video by far.
The music for the mesoarchean era is a fucking slap! Love it 😍
Something that makes me curious. After about the first billion years he mentions that days are shorter because the young earth spins faster…so we base time on the earths rotation being what it is now…are we basing those first billion years on modern rotation (time) measurements? Or did the first billion years go by quicker based on the speed of ancient rotation?
music brings some classic jake chudnow vibes ♥︎ very nice work on this piece Kurzgesagt team!
I can't believe you guys made me cry for the extinction of dinosaurs. This was absolutely awesome!
Cells. Cells within cells.
the technical artists really had a field day with this one, awesome job!
A similar video on the history of Mars would be interesting.
Wow what a long animation 🤯
This video will make history!
Congarts for 10 whole years. I always wait anxious for every video of yours
The video I've been waiting years for! The early earth history in plain and simple terms <3
Amazing man keep it up ❤❤
Wow, Thanks. As always, you have the most articulate description section. Like it was authored by someone who likes what they are doing, more so wants others to know it.
It blows my mind, how Kurzgesagt put out videos explaining how they make their videos, and somehow people still think this video was some kind of huge undertaking. It's basically just a lot of looping, with some transitions. It's well done, but it was not a monumental task.
one hour of his voice, heaven on earth <3
This is awesome.
4.5 billion years in an hour long video That was posted an hour ago
Fantastic!
Behind the scenes of making the earth lol
The background music is so nice.
Am I time traveling if I watch at 2x?
Bruh  That's it  Just BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!
yall if ima getting sent to hel and I'm getting sent back in time ima pray today
A good attempt but Bill Wurtz did it better.
This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! Thank you Kurzgesagt ❤❤❤
It’s not even Christmas yet why are we getting this wonderful gift 😘
This is the most boring and intresting kurzgesagt video i have EVER seen
This is so good! Thank you ! ❤
So, what I'm getting from this is that spore's cell stage should have been 75-90% of the game
I'm definitely watching this later
The legends who still have a long enough attention span to watch the whole thing   | V
The camera man must’ve been paid bank for recording all of this
Happy 10th anniversary, keep greatness in your production. Still believe a video on block chain would be interesting.
The music so good I whip a nae nae while traveling time
I'm watching this in 0.5x speed to double the watchtime for Kurzgesagt
Everything about this is fucking awesome. This is high, high level art.
Are the clouds rotated wrongly in the Stenian period? :)
"Bill Wurtz on Steroids" on Steroids.
This is gorgeous. It's not just the animation that's amazing, but the music too! Just watched through the entire thing and hearing the Time leitmotif in the music at the Permian and Cretaceous periods brought me CHILLS. Epic Mountain Music never misses!
I don't know why but I felt something in my heart and I wanted to cry 😭, thanks a lot for this content, I love your work guys.
This is exactly what my autistic brain needed tonight
You guys are awesome
credit to the  Bangiomorpha pubescens for inventing sex 👏👏
Oh I guess I'm not going out tonight
Holy crap. 4 years! Kudos to all of your dedication! It's a great video!
cool <3
19:40 DOOM begins.
1 HOUR VIDEO?? Did not expect that!!
The mere fact that we only saw humans for a split second should put into perspective how insanely long the earths history has been. Between the Rhyacian and the Stenian we were looking at one and the same landmass, which is longer than the entire Phanerozoic (Cambrian to today). Incredible video, and an incredible showcase of the history of life.
You are so cool! ❤ Thank you!
and despite only being alive for a fraction of a second compared to the Earth's age, those insects called 'humans', are already capable of destroying it all
It's so surreal that, in a video that's little over an hour long, the extinction of the dinosaurs is at about 59:50. Something that we consider to be so insanely long ago happened in a tiny fraction of the Earth's lifespan. It puts the brevity of our lives into such an incomprehensible perspective. Not to mention the entirety of modern human existence occurring in less than a second
amazing long video, thanks kurzgesagt!
great video
This is simply beautiful, what a feast
youtube compression really did this one dirty
no snow ball earth?
There is a visual glich at 29:42 at the bottom of the screen
This video is too incredible❤
Literally the best one hour I've spent in my life
what's next? the history of the universe in 1 hour?
Imagine one like this for human history as well.
Awesome video ! Just wanted to let you know, that at 29:43 , there is a weird graphic error, or whatever you call it.
One of the first people to see the video! so happy
Bruh, they legit dropped "....and a natural nuclear reactor starts" out of nowhere. Imma need to do a lotta googling
Can't wait for part 2 in 4.5 billion years
Humans: "We are the most important thing!" Also, Earth:
God: Ayo!? What's taking so long? Where's the plot?  Natural selection: Let me stew my primodial soup blud. Trust the process.
how da fukk you know what erff lookk lik 4.5 billion yyearz ago????
wow!  ty ❤  this is going to be a legendary video
i watched this almost immediately when i came out
YOO NEW VID
i could put those rain sounds on repeat 😋
Amazing as always :D
Wow.
A one hour kurzgesagt video???. I have literally pinned this for tonight. I'm making popcorn. I'M SO EXCITED!!!
haha nice easter egg
_Everyone liked that_
Thank you so much for this, really good way to put all of it in perspective with amazing animation and music! I cannot even begin to express my appreciation
Was surprised that Bacteria and Fungi are older than the Core :O Billions of Years without the very Dynamo that erected our planetary defense shield.  Of course i will watch the Video again, if it gets uploaded on the Channel with my motherlanguage.
Beautiful, magnificent, thought provoking and humbling.  Thank you everyone at Kurzgesagt.
I wish every person on the planet could see this. How can you go to war, how can you believe in gods, how can you be evil after you see this?
Really great video. I think that if we added the composition of the atmosphere and temperature, it would be very interesting
:( needed more birbs.
1 hour kurzgesagt is actually crazy, for free as well!?
What a ride it was! Complex life on Earth really has only been here for a short moment.
Crazy that people believe in essentially infinite time but have a hard time entertaining the thought of God.
so much amazing animation
Mesmerizing!
yo is hell just sending you back in time cause if so ima start praying
Thinking a lot of The Ocean rn
Props to the music guy who spent a whome hour playng
This is quite a nice time-lapse video! Props to the animator and crew for putting this masterpiece together ❤️
13:45 missing captions: "you've witnessed a Billion years so far."
I'm 25 minutes in - can't wait for humans to show up in the final 0.001 seconds
This is absolutely fantastic. I have no words to describe how beautiful this is.
They gathered all the information into one video. I dont know how they turned that into a masterpiece! Amazing job Kurzgesagt!
dang, and to think they have been working on this for a long time already cuz it's ONE WHOLE HOUR GAWDAMM
I can't just say how magnificent are your works, this kind of animation I have never seen them once!!! You all really love what you do!
An hour long????
banger oomfie
It really gives a perspective on the age of the Earth and life. It takes 27 minutes just for unicellular organisms to gain a nucleus while the surface is barren for the longest time.
This might just be the best birthday month ever, too many awesome things coming out, and then this masterpiece!
Asteroids be like : "On your left..''
I can’t wait to see this become a staple of internet history right before my eyes
1:00:55 SINCE 2019???
cool video! I love it!
LOVING DEM KURZGESAGT UPLOADS
Super cool.
Langgesagt
What an awesome idea and execution. Love it:)
Great video! Thanks for sharing this!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
watching this an our after upload to realize people only just finished watching the video
..., i guess.
Earth "as we know it" with a breathable atmosphere, hospitable climate and plant-life dominating the terrestrial land is such a vanishingly small period of this planet's history. Crazy to think about it, but 500 mya feels so long ago, but it's just a small fraction of Earth's entire history. Mind numbingly crazy to think about.
an hour long" in anutshell" video is like a dream coming true😍🥰
Love how they did a cast at the end. Those teams deserve to be celebrated. Happy 10 years anniversary Kurzgesagt!
if this doesn't get like a hundred million views, I'm rage-quitting youtube
The 4:45 music has me rushing to return a battlemech rental
Watched the whole thing. Bummer indeed. Didnt blink.
That was just great! I have always wanted to create something similar to try to grasp the full scale of the timeline. However, it is just impossible to imagine the immense number of small changes in each of moments that lead from simple cells to all the rest. Good job!
This just tells how negligible humanity is compared to our planet's history.
Crazy that the video is so long, and humanity is represented by seeing Grug for 2 seconds.
Oh yeah...Mesoarchean music rips! Thank you for this amazing video. Watched every minute. And I think I will again in the future. Depths of time are amazing.
<See the length of the video> My brain: THEY DID WHAT?!?!
Can we retitle this ~ Rave EARTH ~ pre-sales begin at Eoarchean.
The music in this is killer
Amazing video ❤
53:30 I'm Amazed 😍
this was awesome
a 1 hour video?? aww you guys are the best!! thank you so much for this vid, kurzgesagt!
Great work, would I have been a teacher I would have used it for a course for sure good material for youngsters
new moving wallpaper unlocked
Props to the cameraman for filming 4.5 billion years of footage👏👏
watched every single second of this!
legends who watch the whole thing  👇
Having channels really do something outside of the norm once in a while, not just for the sake of views, is incredibly wonderful to see. Great on you KG
I love your videos!!
I just got done watching the video and I must say it never stops giving. Very impressive
I need to see this as an animated background, that would be so awesome
History of the entire world I guess but better
This is amazing!
Watched to the end what an achivement😊
Amazing Video, thank you so much for your great work
Shoutout to Bangiomorpha Pubescens for being the first CEO of Sex
Gorgeous video! So profondamente and a great impulse for reflection
Where does God come in and make Adam
Kurzgesagt has officially become an asmr channel/lofi beats channel… and I want more of it.
This is incredible and everyone should see this
59:37  😂😭😭
Did anyone see the rocket ship looking things in the rock at around 48 minutes? Is it some kind of easter egg?
So, the Stenian period was so boring that life literally invented sex to pass the time.
Strap elon musk to a chair and make him watch this video. Thats how difficult it is to sustain life in a sterile planet!!
The sun is a deadly laser!
Wow ...
my gosh
Banger song tbh
Nice Keep it up❤
OK BUT WHERE CAN I GET THE MUSIC😊
0:47 Je suis désolé de corriger votre vidéo de plus d'une heure, qui vous a pris beaucoup trop de temps à le faire, mais apparemment la Lune a été formée en quelques années selon les nouvelles simulation de la nasa, ils auraient j'aurais fait leur situation avec un logiciel avec plus de particules qu'ils avaient avant que l'ancien logiciel, et ont remarquées que dans la simulation, elle s'était formée en quelques jours.
This is like the clean version of bill wurtz's video
This deserves to be the most popular video on YouTube
- Video called "All of history" - Look inside - 99% pre-history   Technically still true I guess...
Nice
A great concept ruined by ads.
Watching the planet's entire history flash by in the time it takes me to get ready in the morning was wild ❤
The speed of these high quality videos being made is insane
I need this in VR!
Watched it all in one sitting, very meditative
TIL: There was a lot of cool techno music since the Earth's formation.
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It could've been half an hour
Well, i guess we got in the party at the right time.
This is awesome❤❤❤❤❤ thank you great music and animation
What baffles me most about this project is that I'm half done and feel entertained. That balance must have been so hard to strike. Incredible project, maybe your best video!
On the next one, y'all should collaborate with Alex Grey
The music in this vid is fantastically great. Very inspired by Tool.
Amazing... is an understatement by far👍
Cool ass video
Absolutely incredible.
This is wild. Its one thing to know how long it took for life to transcend the slimy pond scum stage but its really another to watch and see how long it look for things to show up visually and short a time its been around. This was beautiful tho, amazing. I cant imagine how long it took to make.
As soon as they said how much one second was, I immediately checked the length of the video. I must say I was taken aback... just a little bit
incredible
Crazy to see how humans only take up less than a second of history compared to most others that came before
This is an AMAZING video, and it shows that, despite its length, the Kurzgesagt team put their all in every second of it! ❤  Thanks for sharing 👍 Hope you get a billion views! 👍
HUGE CONGRATULATIONS!! 🎉
I started to watch this on my phone. I realize I need to give this video respect by watching it on TV
The art is absolutely STUNNING, bravo kurzgesagt!!!
This is just amazing well done with it you really inspire me to learn science since I was young I think like 4 and I still love your videos
This was marvelous. Now Ediacaran to today in 1 hour :D
Was wondering if you guys would change the last part length in order to give us a bit more of protagonism or just do the end of the line as short and plain as it should be. So you DID put human beings more time than we deserve... but still being really short indeed.  Great job, guys
This was absolutely amazing! I wish it could’ve gone even longer.
HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO SIGN ME THE F$%# UP
DAMN
The money they get from selling and the support from us the viewers come in this form. In this movie in 4k
What a great video! Love from 🇧🇷
Amazing job guys. You’ve created one of the best YouTube channels.
I never would have thought that Kurzgesagt would make a video as long as this, but now Im glad they did!
9:56  Bloonarius are you there?
insane animation. cant imagine the time and effort!
what a masterpiece, so glad we got this for free.
1시간동안 보다가 스폰지나왔을때 울뻔
59:45 Nice.
I have been waiting for you to tell the full story of earth for years! Thanks for making this, this is the video we all have been waiting for!!🎉🎉
So satisfying when the surface is no longer just rocks and water but filled with vegetation and finally animals! (Though rocks are cool on their own, too.)
Are you planning on a video about fungi? I love your videos ❤
Respect to the cameraman for going back 4,5 billion years to capture all this
I am a flower quickly fading, a wave tossed into the ocean, a vapor in the Wind! How small and insignificant am I? Are we?
This is probable in the top 5 edutainment channels
Already 4.5 billions years?  Man how does time fly when theres a Kurzgessgt video present
Bravo 🎉
Thankyou.❤
Here before the book worshipers flood the comments with “actually the earth is only 6000 years old”
Imagine putting this on a big screen in a theatre. I would totally pay money to go watch it.
YOOOOOOOO LEGENDARY
The universe has smiled upon me, giving me something not dreadful for once
The longest video of Kurgagest ever in history.
Awesome! How/from where did the very first fireball started though?
Hi
Big props to the cameraman for filming for a whole 4.5 billion years! Couldn't have done that myself
"E'th" truly one of the pronounciations of all times
What the!!!!?!? İts insane that 1 hour kurzgesagt video
Christmas came early!!
Qualaty>quantaty wasant tath wgat u had always sayed?
Is the music available for download?
This might be my new favorite vid on all of YouTube, you guys blew it away
An hour long Kurzgesagt vid?! AMAZING!! I'm so excited
Great video. Can you make a video about the history of the human race
THIS IS INSANE WE HAD A SEMINAR IN OUR SCHOOL TODAY AND YOUR CHANNEL'S ONE OF VIDEO CLIP WAS SHOWN TALKING ABOUT DRUGS 🗿
wow! 1 houuurr! although i do not agree with this it is soooooooo coollll and all the science is amazing! Thanks for your videos!!!
just wow!
I'm watching this in ×2.22222222E−10 speed
4.5 billion years in 1 hour is pretty good. Any of your animators gonna quit if I suggest a 3 hour vid from the beginning of the universe?   Already have the last hour animated.
A new kugsart video for the beginning of a programming session? Its one hour long!? My day is a lot better now
The first cymbal crash near the 4-minute mark made me think they were going to borrow the music from the old VSauce video that did a time lapse for the most recent 100k years of humans
1 hour of Kurzgesagt animations !
Well done to the lot of you it’s been great seeing all of the effort put into these topics videos and larger projects over the past nearly a decade we’ll done and here’s to more for the future.
fungi being older than the earth's core was not something i expected that sounds so weird...
Cold outside, volume 110%, drinking cheap wine, ordered fried chicken what a life
This had to of took years to make  Edit: It did, AMAZING WORK!!!
Wild ride, you guys did an amazing job!
The Sun is a deadly lazer
Is this Jake Chudnow music?
Would love to see a video on abiogenesis.
broo this is the shit that people are paying for the stuff dont even get, its insane,
Make a soft spoken one without music for ASMR?
Nonsense. Universe has only about 6000 years old
I hate cliffhangers 🤣
a
“At this time the atmosphere is mostly  CO2 and the floor is lava” 😐😐😐
Man, you tube gave me the longest ad in the middle. It took 7.5 million years just for me to skip it!
Merci beaucoup pour ce travail d’une extrême qualité ! C’est vraiment touchant de pouvoir observer aussi agréablement l’histoire de notre planète
Earth is a sick metal album cover
Nice, that means we humans are basically destroying all of this progress in like 0000000000000.1 seconds lol
subtitles not timed correctly around 13:40
Just. One. More. Epoch…
all in one sitting
I'd never thought that the "the floor is lava" challenge has an historical background that literal
This was Epic Mountain's video. They outdid themselves. I love the recurring light themes throughout  the video.
Oops, I blinked
nice video
I don't want to blink because I'll miss millions of years.
I appreciate the weirdly heavy, Doom-esque soundscape to the Mesoarchean period.
mappa crying in the background becaz of this beautiful animation:
Music is sick!!!
0:44 I love this already <3
I’ve never seen anything like this.  This was amazing and I’m glad to be alive to have seen it.
I comment exactly 1 hour after to celebrate this 1 hour video
1 ENTIRE HOUR?? 😨🤯🤩
All I can say to this video is "YAAAAAAAS"! So fun to watch. I love the stuff you all make. Thank you.
Its amazing that the camera man was able to film this whole time lapse.
Yes. I indeed feel new. Thank you!
Ok
This whole thing makes me wanna play StarCraft
Too long
The music slaps!
You make good videos. Make one telling story of Palestinian Muslims and how they were robbed by zionists.
I wish there was a little globe in the corner to give an idea for what earth looked like from space during it’s different periods  But! Ether way that was a great watch 👍
Absolutely amazing!
54:06 glizzy fish
Mesmerizing as ever!
Kurzgesagt truly listens and loves their viewers❤ for years now I’ve been watching and you never cease to amaze me !! THANK YOU KURZ FOR ALL YOU DO
what a crazy feat. mad props to the Kurzgesagt team!
1:36 Who played "The floor is lava" when he said it
Fuck imagine watching this high
amazing🔥🔥
I was not prepared for the brevity of all human history in this...
The music in these videos have always been great, but this takes it to a whole new level
This video was produced by the first rock
The floor is lava
I love you Kurzgesagt 🥰
Where bill wurzt covers the condensed history of evolution process and a tiny bit of human existence, kurzgesagt covers the live footage illustration of earth itself..
This video is proof that the world is flat
Thank you, Kurzgesagt.
Kurzgesagt giving me the birthday present I didn't even realized I wanted
Would you be able to see any stars with the light from the lava in the Hadeon?
I am just 5 minutes in and this music is an absolute BOP.
Somehow I'm not on psychedelics watching this.
Alien visiting earth 3 billion years ago.  "No way any living being come from this planet"
My new lofi😊
😭😭😭😭i was just praying for a video today, never expectd the prayer to get accepted with this much intensity like 1 hour of kurzgesagt!!!!????!
Wait What?! How's this content free!!
Congratulations on making the most interesting video in 4,5 billions years 🤓👌👍👏🫶
13:50 yay
Bill wurtz laughing in a corner
bill wurtz would be proud
WHAT! a 1 hour animated video, props to Kurzgesagt and the team behind this beautiful display of the past 4.5 billion years
Respect to the camera man who survived multiple mass extinctions and uninhabitable environments to record this video!
53:15 life emerges! we start seeing large organisms
Massive props to the camera person for being this dedicated for 4.5 billion years!
Please don't sell, if Disney asked.
I think this would have to have 64,782,996,588,822 views for it to be watched for an equivalent amount of time. (I know I don’t account for leap years) The math: 60×60=3600 (second in an hour) 3600×24=86400 (seconds in a day) 86400×365=31,536,000 (seconds in a year) 31,536,000×4,500,000,000= 2.46888e17 (seconds in 4.5b years) (big number my calculator can't write out) Now we find out how many second in this video (60×63+31=3811 (seconds in this video) Divide the amount of seconds in 4.5b years by how long this videos length in seconds and you get how many times this has to be viewed 2.46888e17/3811= 64,782,996,588,821.83 rounded up because you can't get .83 people  to get: 64,782,996,588,822
Hillarious to see that everything was going peaceful, until the humans came.  By the way, great effort by Kurzgesagt team, I haven't donated to any YT channel ever in my life, but I think it's time I will. Most amazing video <3
The music onto he mesoarchean era🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
history of the entire world i guess pt2
My first reaction : was nice Kurz posted a new video , then i saw it's ONE HOUR oh myyy 🤯
Good work to everyone involved in this.👍👍
Why didn't the ducks gave a speech at UN yet
this is amazing I watched the whole thing
you guys really outdid yourselves with this one. epic!
Amazing
Holy mole new kurzgesagt just dropped
This was a wonderful project and I am so glad you guys put this out! what a long ass time, bruh
This is YouTube video of the year
Love how the music evolves too!
Oh man i feel that im gonna be returning here often
really big project, really like it! well done! <3 <3 <3 <3
Amazing work as always kurzgesagt. You guys always manage to outdo yourself each time. This animation is so well made and so much love given into it. One thing i really took note in this video is the music. It's so good I'm' grooving while learning so much from this informative video. Keep up the amazing work guys.
This is the coolest Kurzgesagt video ever.
This is absolutely amazing! Every second of it looks like it took hours to make!
I had to pee once and i lost few millions in bathroom😢😢
Commenting just to help the video get promoted by the youtube algorithm. This video deserves it
This is Kurzgesart’s take on “the history of the world I guess” 😂
A track for each era!
No way you guys animated a hour , LEGENDS
Aww the moon was so tiny when it came back around for the first time. Idk about y'all but I was actively watching in the haden to see the moon cool and get smaller
its facinating to think about that life on earth is not much younger than the planet itself, but we  have been around for such a short time in comparison, i mean, the age of Umanity in this video is what, 1/3 of a second?
YOOO this is Kurzgesagt’s version of “the history of the world, I guess”
"Life erm... finds a way!" Love it
watchin the whole thing took a while
In awe at how they do this man Absoloutely amazing A whole show:For FREE In actual awe man I cant get over it! Sooooo goood Such a good video i watched the wholeee masterpiece   This cannot be described with words Spent the last FOUR YEARS working on this and it PAID OFF Omg how good will the next vids be 😮😮😮😊😊😊😮😮😮😊😊😊😮😊
Hope i felt something? Oh i felt a lot of things. Mostly i felt insignificant in the large scale of things. As should be.
45min: Kurzgesagt dude being naughty lol
Amazing, just wow. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
35:25 kinda slaps
THIS IS AWESOME
I really really really want to use this as a 4K live wallpaper. Is there any way for me to get/buy the original high quality (non Youtube compressed) video?
Switched to 1,25 speed. Not gonna lie, it feeles like trance parade from Berlin.
It's amazing how homo sapiens only emerge in the last 0,1 seconds. We have just showed up, everyone.
Amazing!! Hope to see more of these kind of experimental videos.
That was amazing! That SYNTH!!! on point!
You forgot to tell about the first mass distinction because of oxygen. Because until then there was no oxygen all the microorganism had evolve to live without it and it was toxic for them. So when there was enough oxygen (from photosynthesis) all these organism died exept the photosynthetic ones.But overall great video!!!
man now i gotta taked acid again, what a shame ;)
44:59 damn
I mean cool animation but I cannot imagine anyone watches this unless they want to sleep😂
I've always loved Kurzgesagt but this video, in particular, is a masterpiece. Special shout out to Thomas Veith and Fabian Glaser for scoring this so perfectly.
Thank you for creating this, it was truly an expierence to watch
This video is going to be one of those legendary YouTube videos that we never forget ❤️🤍🖤
was this narrated by an AI version of our boy? some of the inflections seemed off. Or maybe its normal and im just being rude
Let's be honest it's animation and 3d imagination according to the west ideology, it's not history at All
A few million years later, another intelligent being may evolve. In that timeline, humans would be shown how they appeared, destroyed themselves, and the majority of life forms. Afterward, Earth would heal itself once again.
Kurzgesagt animators try not to be awesome challenge (impossible)
Incredible how short everything we think of as life is, after the Cambrian Explosion, compared to the eons that came before it. Kudos to the team!
Usually those phases are summarized in two sentences and suddenly... humankind
What have you done!!!!? This is amazing and it is truly beautiful that every person can access this video. Thank you guys.
Trance music is the best!
If you didn't already, make a 10 hour version with no talking. ZZzZZzz
4.3 billion years ago, the music was on fire....literally and figuratively.
Congrats making 4,5 billion years of content
no way we're getting 1 hour of kurzgesagt
This is such a good thing to keep in background and work/sleep. Thanks Kurzgesagt
This was both extremely relaxing and interesting show of scale.  I could watch more of these (although I can imagine that this is a HUGE undertaking) !
Kurzegazat is my favourite place for science every where. Thank you for 10 years ❤️🦆
29:42 There is a small glitch here
Can't believe the long periods are over
Well done Kurzgesagt, this is legitimately incredible!
This was quite the treat before bed
This could basically be considered a feature length movie and I'm sure not a single person would complain about that. *ONE HOUR* of beautifully animated, story-packed Kurzgesagt goodness just sounds far too good to be true, yet here we are!
This video has to be soo cool while being high
I didn't know an animated video could give me goosebumps. wow
Rome wasn’t built in a day…… Hold my Earth
Im the typ of guy who makes a comment on youtube every 3-4 years. This video made me do create one. Questioned my existence by the end. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
Thanks loki for holding on the sacred timeline for us
The song "The Greatest Show on Earth" by Nightwish could have been a perfect sound track for this one... Check it out, if you're not familiar with them. And if you are...  🎶"WE WERE HEEEEREEEE!"🎶 💥🤘😆🤘💥  Greetings from Italy! 👋🇮🇹🖖
History of the entire world, I guess 2 just dropped 🗿
53:29 still doesn't explain how extremely complicated life began,which seems 1 in a trillion by chance!
Who else is eating popcorn
Props to the camera man that recorded earth for 4.5 billion years.
that... was... AMAZING!! genuinely got chills towards the end, the music was amazing, the leitmotifs appearing here and there were very cool!!
This is amazing
This is my first day of vacation, and I am going to devote myself to the entire hour because I can, and want to. This is an amazing project!
I assume somebody mentioned it but the year counter at the top right says million and not billion when the narrator says "you have witnessed a billion years so far"
I came here to view the humans' evolution. But looks like I missed it when I blinked at some point of the video...
Wow 1 hour Kurzgesagt ! I can not wait to watch that comfortably installed in my sofa . Thanks in advance
Gonna be jamming this soundtrack for a long time. Tool fans better check this out...
am i the only one who thinks the music in this reminds me of boneworks
Would you consider making a condensed version that skips to the next commentary after a few seconds?
I’ll look for the music for this clip in iTunes… thx.  My favorite is Dyson Sphere.
We need a version of this cut down to around 15 minutes I’m too adhd to watch this without skipping the B roll w no script😂😂
What a beautiful and fantastic video. The continous sidescolling, the beautiful music with its repetetive elements which reminded me of the music of Philip Glass, it all has an almost hypnotic effect. Thanks a lot for this unexpected treat. Fantastic job.
are they one upping bill wurtz? cuz i gotta say if yes youre doing it well
Kurzgesagt: The Movie🤩
It's clever and brief to condense the history of the earth for one hour, but at the same time, it can remind people how they stand on the earth and live. What is the value of existence?
why does the mesoarchaen era go so hard
Thank you Bill Gates this sum real  good shit
I wish i thought to add kurzgesagt music to my playlist sooner, these new songs are so good!
This is…. Impressive.
Earth is old
I think that this video deserves to be preserved like a historical document. This could teach generations of how the earth was like long ago.
This is absolutely amazing!
incredibly beautiful video, one of your most unique and special works🎉
this is an amazing live wallpaper!
This. Was. Beautiful
Would recommend releasing another version of this video with no voice AT ALL in it. Basically a soundscape/background music version people can use to study/sleep whatever.
I am in awe! Thanks for this!!
It's like 6 new videos of Kurzgesagt continuous!!
Perfect video for lunch break
This is so impressive, good work on this one
what we as humans have achieved in the last thousands of years is quite remarkable.
Heres one way to make an hour feel like 10 minutes. I truly applaud and thank the animation team for blessing us with such an intelligent, yet easy to understand and entertaining lesson of earths history.
Wait, I thought this was created in 7 days!?
OH MY GOD! this video is gorgeus and so well made I love it SO SO SO much!!!
I love how many more timestamps there are towards the end.
Play it at 1.25 speed and you got a rave!
Interesting to think all this might just be someone's lab experiment
1 hour ??? yoooo EPIC
45:00 they invented SEX! lets goooo!
This is such a bop. Just leave this on in the background while I'm doing stuff and learn a bit about the history of Earth. LFG Kurzgesagt!
This could have been 10min, who has the time to watch an hour long slide show with almost no talking, ruins the whole video.
This would be an amazing live wallpaper!
I appreciate that the documentation, writing and generation of this video has been a job of biblic proportions.  Thank you for your efforts, and your generosity. I understand this is subjective, but I don't like the accompanying music. The techno genre is perfect, but the repetitive progressions you used for more than one hour become - to my ears - both a distraction and an annoyance. Again, this is highly personal, and the background music you used may sound angelical and argentine to someone else. A couple of suggestions from py part for a musical accompaniment - "Switched on Bach" from Wendy Carlos, or "The Man Machine" from the Kraftwerk.  Regards, Anthony
Thank you so much for this. I was looking for such a documentary. Saved. If you could, would you publish an edit without voice-over that can run in the background indefinitly?
the animation is amazing but the MUSIC holy shit!!!
@kurzgesagt you could enable the thank$ option ;)
LADIES AND GENTEL MAN!! MAY I PRESENT TO YOU THE kurzgesagt movie!!!
No way you just uploaded this video, wow
I would love a version where you don't say anything.
wow
Babe wake up new the history of the world I guess just dropped
Thank goodness, I got a history test soon
earth at the beginning is literally your childhood
I've been waiting for you to make this video for a year while not really it's actually like 5 months or could be even 6 months we will never know
Yes.
Wow!! Awesom gift for the weekend!
Holy Moly 1 hour?!  Thank you so much. That's actually amazing
This video was amazing
This is where the fun begins
I am already looking forward to someone making a YTP of this.
Most of us don't even realize how awesome this big rock we're calling home is but at the same time how fragile and tiny it is. This video was amazing thanks for the effort y'all put into this!
Just finished watching the whole video. Wow  I think it would be an understatement to say that you all did great. I think it especially goes without saying that the illustration and animation teams did incredible work that made this possible, and overall the art direction made it feel like I didn’t waste a single second of this hour. I want to also give massive credit to the audio team, because background music often goes underappreciated, but I was bopping my head to it the whole time. Everyone who worked on this over the past 4 years… good job, you’ve done something amazing
Can we have version without the music so we can fall asleep while watching this at 3 AM?
Good Thing I Subscribed!😀😇😍
This is AWESOME! Fantastic work, as always!
anyone just finished?
Fun fact: the solar system has orbited the Milky Way galaxy only ~TWICE since the Cambrian explosion (once every 250 million years) 53:39
If you set it to playback speed x2, you get 4.5 billion years in ½ hours.
Thank you for the best trippy video ever
This video is a little... Dated.   But really great job on this its very intertaining and I dont know why
This video is great to have on while practising music as well. 10/10 video.
a comment for the algorythm
The intersection between Kurzgesagt fans and synthwave fans are going crazy now. <3
Wonderful music!!!!
More like 30mins at 2x speed
Also, I LOVE the credits song (and all the music in this video in fact)
this is completely amazing
Atmosphere mostly co2 and the floor is lava. Hell phase takes awhile.  Sit back
Very cool idea:)
much hot and comfy?
I can't believe people think this is so impressive. It's a loop with minor changes for each era and everyone is losing their mind over it.  For a channel (that does animation for 10+ years) with 20 million subscribers this was probably one of their easiest projects, a loop disguised as 1h of quality animation.
I Like HISTORY!!!!!!!
Great vid and fasinating. It must have taken a long time to make. I wish tho that u could download it so u could use it as a baground, but all in all great vid
Am kinda sad that I can’t support kurzgesagt in any other way then a like and a sub because they really bring great and amazing content and animation and just chefs kisses to every video they post( I know there is a patron but am not in a position to do that)
29:41  Woah wtf
50:10 Behold, the actual first race war
The music in this is killer, well done
The soundtrack is incredible!!
TIL: Sex is almost as old as Earth's core.
Incredible work guys, the effort this must have taken is immense and it must've taken eons (pun intended) to complete!
if at first after the collision with thea the planet was a big ball of lava, where did the water came from? also did i understand correctly, earths core starts to solidify from the center outwards? shouldnt be hoter at the center and colder outwards?
The fact that they spent 4.5 billion years animating this is just amazing
this is really cool
Man the earth sure took it's sweet time to get to the good bits.😂
Weenor
This is a Skyrim level lore dump
knowing these guys they probably even did the math to make it take the 'camera' an hour to go around the earth
How can someone believe in a God after this
Just watched the whole thing in one sitting. AMAZING!
I was thinking: 1 hour? That's got to be in separate videos, or you need to pay, or something like that... but nope, its just an hour. No click bait. :)
Kurzgesagt- In a Coconut shell
This will make phenomenal digital paintings.
wait what ? 1hour of pure kurzgesagt ? It's not even christmas yet and santa already giving me birthday present
every second passed from  the moment this video was posted online should be equivalent to 1k likes
👏👏👏👏👏👏
It felt so fucking strange when I noticed that I watched 50 minutes, and was seeing literally nothing but landscape and some other things. This really explains a lot the beautifulness of life, when we got close to the Cambrian explosion, I felt somewhat anxious. It's funny to compare this to the Bill Wurtz version, to reach it we needed only to watch about 3 minutes, here, it's *53* minutes.
Whyyyyy did you add the terrible music track, was so peaceful and enjoyable until it kicked in around the 4 min mark...
small animation glitch at 29:41
You guys should turn on super chats
You did A lot to get here CRAZY!!!😇🥰😍🤩😘😄😁😆
20:00 why did the music have to go so hard here
Can we just appreciate that they put so much effort in this videos like my comment if you agree please say thanks nobody has done that 😭you don't have to if you don't want to your the best 😎like my comment if you agree
This video is an experience, not just a video, and I love it.
Skipping through this hour is a disrespect to this masterpiece  Thanks Kurzgesagt
81 People 4 years of hard work for this Masterpiece Thank you so much
Now we know why kurzgesagt was gone for 2 weeks  Edit: Epic mountain has been busy with 6 full songs for this one video, just legendary
An hour long? This is one for the Chromecast and big screen
This music slaps so hard 🔥🔥🔥
saw the entire thing! its incredible!
Crazy, how old the game, "The Floor is lava!" actually is 🤯
Ah crude I blinked
A tour de force. Really brings to bear just how long the world has existed.
The music Bro
OMG! 쿠르츠게작트가 1시간짜리라니! 한국어 자막이나 한국어판 나왔으면 좋겠네요!
I just watched the first few minutes because I couldn't resist, and now I'm just waiting for a block of them when I can watch it in full and really take it all in. I AM SO HYPED FOR THIS!!
This is the only Eras Tour I need
All this is so beautiful. I'm moved🥺
All this just so the universe can observe itself.
58:38 *Sad Music Starts* Dinosaurs: Huh?
I think this is the first time that the narrator addresses himself in the first person (by saying I) at the beginning of the video
The fact that the entire human civilation not even last a second is just so crazy
this really helps put into perspective just how short all of the new stuff is, the fact that out of an hour long video, humans barely get less than a second is so awe inspiring
Holy shit, one hour?!?
Aww I would've loved to see the sky slowly turn blue. Great video though!
Really good stuff. Puts into perspective how new and fragile our species is.
If someone asks you what peak kurzgesagt looks like, well just show them this video I guess
How long would a mortal brain last in an immortal body?
44:52 the sex update is real
IS THIS RIYAL!?
This is incredible epic. Thanks, Kurzgesagt! ❤
12:39 That lightning transition was AWESOME!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful work
Bueatiful. I love it, I’m saving this to my “too good to be true” playlist fr
Amazing. Just truly amazing is how to describe this video.
Thanks a lot for such great video, it's a difficult topic. Where did all the water come. How it got created in the first place. While the earth and sun and everything around was 30% more hot than today, why did the water not evaporated...???
Amazing - thank you Kurzgesagt!
I love this. The way the visuals, and especially the music progress is amazing. Really good!
Is it possible to like this video 4.5 billion times? 😊
where can i get this as a desktop wallpaper
I am absolutely speechless right now. Kurzgesagt, you guys just, wow, I am quite literally beyond words right now. This was absolutely incredible guys, to the whole team you guys are just absolutely, unequivocally, 100% amazing. I was in discord the entire time while watching this and it is mind blowing to just see how we got all the way from our humble beginnings to us today in the human era. Thank you guys so much for making this and you guys did an absolutely fantastic job!! I truly do not have words to express just how much I enjoyed this, you guys are absolutely awesome and keep up the absolutely amazing work!!!!
1 hour of peace and hope ❤️
Im starting to suspect the kurzgesagt animators made a pact with the animation god in exhange for their hands Because goddamn the ammount of time it would take to even animate a fraction of this
I loved the Hadean, the temperature was just right for my skin and the moon was so beautiful. The stars were so bright and jumping around on the hot rocks was a lot of fun.
45:00 biggest W in the history of Earth
bro think he bill wurtz💀
This is one of the cases where I wish they had a "love" button. I literally shed tears over things like this. It's a loveletter to amateur science geeks and really changes your knowledge and perception of Earth's early history. As far as I know, no one has ever attempted to create something like this, and it's an absolute work of art.
This is fantastic! I can imagine this running in the background in science museums all over the world
Christians be like: No! This book doesn't say so.
definitely gonna rewatch this a few times! <3
In the beginning, Epic Mountain was created. The rest is explained in the video.
This was perfect background noise for editing, thanks for the content guys!!!!
TBH  at 20 minutes in (it's broad daylight and i'm not that comftarble) and i'm yawing. great if you need to fall asleep. (not becase it's boring, just the soundtrack!)
the music really reminded me of the deadbolt game sometimes
Not even a second wow
While this video is great, it lacks information. Sure, i know whats happening visually, oh water's rising, oh that is a sponge, oh the moon is getting farther, etc. Most of us watching aren't scientists, and most of us (hopefully) are here to learn, i may know whats going on visually, but i want to know it in details. Whats happening chemically, physically, biologically and from other scientific prospective. Examples such as why did it take long for life to evolve? The earth core formed very later on, why? What are the details of the biggest mass extinction? And so on. And one point, the ballance is falwed in my opinion. The first eon where earth was hell like planet didn't have a lot of details (at least that we know about) unlike the later eons that contained life, so by giving them all the same ratio is a bit flawed.  Great video however, i appreciate your work and will continue supporting it.
such a good video
"Hey babe what are you listening to?" "Mesoarchean beats baby!! This shit slaps!"
This is AMAZING. Please do one for Mars too!?
44:57 Go Algae Bangiomorpha Pubescens!!
THIS IS AMAZING
19:42 the Mesoarchean was apparently visited by the Doom Slayer if this track has anything to say about it 😭😭
so cool
As a dinosaur I totally approve of this
Kurzgesagt: the Movie
It would be so cool to walk on the surface of earth in the middle of the Eoarchean era...      I mean I'm sure I'd die, but still, so cool
hi.
One hour os see god create earth
someone has to make a wallpaper in wallpaper engine out of this
29:43 unexpected glitch
We've wait 1 month for this and it's all worth it
It's very daunting that complex life only existed for less than 10 minutes.
was i the only one to watch the entire thing??
i like how in the Mesoarchean its this like metal tune while literally fucking nothing is happening
Okay but there shouldve been time skips cause it feels more like a music video now
This is an absolutely beautiful piece of art. The music and the animation, classic kurzgesagt lit animation, for 1 hour straight it has to be one of the best documentaries on our planet and all its stages. If you didnt understand it i love it more than anything❤❤❤
This is incredible
happy aniversary
Play in 1.25x your welcome
Guess that is in the nutshell for a long history of Earth and fraction of human history.
Can't believe ......just ......woow....
The first people who watched the whole thing finished now.
😍 This is absolutely BRILLIANT! 🤩 Watching with my 2 year old son, he's dancing and clapping to it, telling me the bright colors and what he sees. I'm overwhelmed feeling so alive and in awe. 🥹 Couldn't help but start to cry at how beautiful it is to be alive. 🤯 Mind-blowing to be part of the consciousness of our planet. 🎶 The music is also what undoes me. OPTIMISTIC NIHILISM is one of my fav vids and songs ever (my world view). Grasping at the cosmic perspective, where you experience just glimpses of the vastness of the cosmos and how incredible it is to be alive, overwhelmes and brings me to tears. THANK YOU FOR THIS! 🥰
The greatest show on Earth
Beautiful
Just started the video, but this has the possibility to be one of the best vidoes ever posted on the internet
This is an amazing video. As a civil engineering student taking geoscience classes, this really helps me fall in love with the chemical history of the earth 💙💫
And you know some people are going to try and debunk this absolute BEAUTY of art
This is amazing
My God this channel is awesome, 1 hour worth of animation is like 10 of your videos. And it's brilliant, informative animation too. Thank you so much for your dedicated work.
Haven't even watched it and already know it's a contender for one of the best videos on Youtube
It has a strong beat. I couldn't dance to it.
This is the precious gem you got. Thank tou Kurzgesagt for the video. The fact that it took 4 years to make it makes it more precious
Commenting to feed the algorithm. I’m 2/3 through the Hadean thus far and the music is killer!
I can already hear "Somebody That I Used To Know" playing under it.
It's pretty cool to think I've been on the toilet for 743 million years
These would make great live wallpapers
This is such a stunning & beautiful production. Well done and a huge thanks to you and your whole team 🎉❤👏👏👏🌹
An hour of my time, not at all wasted
41:34 I made it here before I have to go to work. Truly amazing
Have you guys found all 10 eastereggs? 😅
Ok so sex was invented 1.2 billion years ago? Got it.
53:34 It's the caaambrian explosion
Absolutely remarkable! 👍🏾  Also, Happy 10th Anniversary! 🌎
This is really cool!
Lets gooo I havent watched it yet but this is what i needed and im sure its gonna be awesomeee
Thank you lord for this amazing video
What a treat. Thank you Kurzgesagt team for everything you guys do.
Amazing work guys. I always knew how long it took for life to develop, but seeing it in a form of this video gave me an understanding how quickly things have changed, and how empty were a few billion years in the history of our planet. It's as if someone put time in an ever increasing fast forward.
Did Bill Wurtz inspire this? Be honest. I won't judge. He made one hell of a video. I like your animation style better, though.
45:03 the most crucial time for life
Amazing video glad that i watched it all
Really gives prospective how new(as far as we know)life is
We need a 10 hours long of this lmao
I can’t under state… how grateful I am for this
Now we need a new book from you called EONS
I feel like a lot more effort could have gone into this video. Instead of having long periods with literally nothing, it would have been nice if some of the geological processes would have been explained, or e.g. when the first life was formed, it could have been described how the metabolism of the life was/what strategies they used to survive at different point in time. Otherwise good video though
Very relaxing ❤
This is Langegesagt. Took way too long. I skipped most of it. But maybe others likes it. I prefer you shorter Kurzgesagt videos.
Pretty neat
What a masterpiece!  This should win multiple awards
The amount of effort put into this video is insane, love the Kurzgesagt team. I've watched yall for atleast 5 years now and the insane quality increases have been amazing. Here's to another 5 years of me watching Kurzgesagt
amazing
58:45 The Cretaceous period was the most beautifully animated in my opinion!
Can you please explain the firmament
What a way to spend a friday night. This was truly wonderfull and special props to the backing tracks! LOVE IT!
This is beautiful in animation, music, narration, and it well encapsulates the ages of history.   Keep going strong Kurzgesagt team
59:43 "Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs." "It's okay. They're not going anywhere...Where'd they go?"
a 1 hour video from kurzgesagt! am i in heaven?
1 hour of kurzgesagt animation? although it seems more low effort then other videos done by kurzgesagt, it's still impressive
That's a lot of nutshells.
It went so fast...
Kurzgesagt
Man i know you guys probably won’t see this comment, but I have to say that I have the utmost respect for your dedication to making high quality educational videos, i’ve been following you guys since I was 5 and it always shocks me to see how you have advanced in your quality. Keep up the brilliant work.
Nice. 1 hour long. Thank you for this video
That's a pretty cool video.
Kurzgesagt: *Posts one hour animation about everything* Me: *Holding back every urge to say "But we all know God created everything!"*
this is awesome, good job icl
Need a channel in Tamil.
An hour long. I’m speechless.
A 1 hour Kurzgesagt video video may be the greatest thing the internet has given me
Oh my god.
This show really went downhill after they introduced humans.
This is amazing, those are just words to you, but to me, they mean A LOT
I already know everything from @billwurtz's video, but I'll give it a watch anyways  😉
AN HOUR LONG VIDEO ITS TIME TO PARTY
Wow, epic!
The amount of times I’m gonna watch this is crazy
I watched this literally at the hour mark lol
I respect your efforts for this video
why not just make the video 4.5 billion years long?
10/11/23
should I pay for this? i feel guilty watching this for free
uneccessarily long and boring, half the video is just the same music and animation in a loop... and if you try to skip it you miss the explainations which are scattered in between
10/10 stoner video 10/10 stoner music
making a bill wurtz history of the world? nice... its only kind of it but nice also less stressing.
Props to the camera man for living and recording through all of this
Wow, I was surprised when you said that this project started in 2019, but it was indescribable and worth all the effort❤❤
This had to take SO long! And we get it for free! You guys at kurzgesagt are amazing!
My Indonesian friend want to watch you but he can't understand English
This needs No.1 Trending
This is truely a masterpiece
Wow, what a journey. Thank you Kurzgesagt ❤
the Hadean feels just like a normal day at work
Where is the full 4.5 billion year video?
This soundtrack is a banger
Can you make video about whole human history in 1 hour.
the music later in the video is so tool-like
is this real?
This would go HARD as a desktop wallpaper
This is a monumental achievement.
40 minutes in: *life is still just cells*  😳🫠
yay
After finishing Netflix's new Life show with Morgan Freeman, it seems fitting Kurzgesaght releases a similar video the next day. Guess I'm on a hopeful existenstial dread binge.
doom music kick in around 20min haha
To think all this happend for me to be here watching this and eating slami and pesto on flatbread
there should be another version of this uploaded with only the sound effects, the ambience is great
Floor Is lava mentioned
This has been a fantastic watch. Whelp, time to go again!
Came for the timelapse, stayed for the soundtrack
I need this as my desktop wallpaper haha
Absolutely love this and I'm only a few minutes in, I want this as a computer background so bad
It was amazing
Amazing video. Very nice music
1 HOUR! 1 flipping hour even their 8 minite videos take them month so this must have been in the works for LITTERAL YESRS
Objection! We don’t think there was a mass extinction at the end of the Cambrian anymore. Plus what about the two at the end of the Devonian? And the end-Triassic, so soon after the Great Dying?
No words, just amazed how we get this type of quality content for free
That is the entire History of the world... I guess.  But for real, an hour of Animation takes a lot of dedication!  Can't wait to re-watch this every month because of the Kurzgesagt addiction.
I almost fell asleep it was so calming and peaceful and it made me realize that how young the human race is
This just shows how much of Earth’s history was basically just nothing
It's crazy how human history is only equivalent to 1.5 seconds of this video!  Talk about having patience to get to where we are 4.5 billion years later. Thank you Earth for giving us a home but we have to do better taking care of it..
"Once Upon a Time… The Earth" :)
This is genius
:0 What is this!!!!
Great music
What on earth is that robot cheese wheel fish around 54:07?
WOAH???????
LESSSGOOOOOOO
Ah yes, "4.5billion years to chill and relax too" the lofi channels gotta get their shit together, science is improving
Wait.. 1 HOUR LONG VIDEO?? I watched 10 mins and thought wow it's long, how much time do I have left
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE HISTORY CLASS WITH THIS ONE 😎😎😎
Very cool!
Great work!!! thank you Kurzgesagt
Grabbing some pop corn
Kurzgesagt, true to their name, manages to tell us a story 4.5 billion years long in just an hour.
To be fair I was pretty bored.... But just imagine being 1.500.000 times as bored😮
"1 hour later" meme fits here
WOAH. An hour of Kurzgesagt-level animation must have taken forever! Props to you guys, this is awesome!!
10/10 the music slaps and the fact of how nice the animation looks makes me awe
THIS IS EPIIIIICCC!!!!
The music in the Mesoarchean sounds like a Tool song.
Holy shit its one hour
This is a masterpiece. I'm honoured to have seen it on my feed 25minutes after it was posted
langgesagt
Obrigado Kurzgesagt por ser o canal mais incrível do YouTube, aqui quem fala é um jovem pesquisador do interior da floresta amazônica/Brasil. Vocês me estimularam a seguir o caminho da ciência, o que fazem é simplesmente insano.
WaitI had heard that at some point in time, plants were actually purple until they found out being green was better.  When did that happen?
This is so sick
cool concept :)
History of the entire world I guess PART 2
Eu amo tanto esse canal meu deus
It must of taken 4.5 billion years to animate this video! 🎉
Wonderful representation of Earths history, would have loved to see a little stats panel with things like atmospheric composition, temp, stages of life etc.
1.2 billion years ago, not much is happening... except sex just got invented so that's cool
58:08 this is a weird part
Wow. Any screenshot from this video could be used as a wallpaper! Thank you Kurzgesagt!
dude
Now I've been waiting 4.5 billions years for the food to be ready Mom. Hope you read this.
Wow. 10 years.
WOW  I mean.. WOW I'm shaking right now
I am so happy thank you so much for this
What this is crazy
this is so cool to see how much they've improved lately
Langgesagt
Best birthday present ever
You got me at "the floor is lava" 😅 Amazing video
I appreciate the efforts of Kurzgesagst to help us improve our understanding of the universe.
WOW! This video is the best of all I've seen on YouTube! It is absolutely amazing to see the entire history in just such a short time! Extremely great work and thank you so much for creating the best videos! 🙂
Greatest science project ever.
The startup time for complex life is astonishing, really puts it into perspective.
When I was studying Geology I was told that there are some challenges to the thea impact theory, not sure where it went now.  I've also extracted zircon from igneous rocks. It's quite involved.
me watching it at 2 times speed:
This is soooo cool. Amazing!
1:05 The floor is lava: EXTREME edition
Is it christmas??
Someone just finished the video without skipping anything
I don’t know but this fun for no reason kurgestgat make things that are boring fun like learning
Congratulations to Epic Mountain for making the music, truly a work of art and perseverance to make so much.
My face when I saw an hour long Kurzgesagt video: 😮  Still haven’t been able to close my jaw
I can’t believe video about every single year of earths history. That’s just amazing and I hope you make videos just like this one in the future and that the fact that we got all of this stuff plants, animals, air water, and much more for like free is like insane.
Shout-out to the animators for their perfect and satisfying animation❤   Edit: really makes you miss the old long term videos that wouldn't lower your attention span to goldfish's
Happy anniversary
Music is straight 🔥
Omg  5 YEARS?! I give up doing my art after 10min you are incredible thank you soooooooooooooooo much🥳🥳🥳🥳🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😇😇😇😇😇😇
well, this is a video
Amazing video
Wow this is one really high quality video This must've taken so long to make
Y’all need to team up with lofi girl.
What a mesmerizing experience, well worth to watch the full hour without skips, and normal velocity.
WOW! 😍😍
🌍🌎🌏
Incredible to say the least
wow
This is like the final boss for pop-science on Youtube. Amazing work peeps of kurzgesagt!
“Might have invented sex” 😂😂😂   This video is absolutely incredible and the music better than ever! Great job!
7:22 it’s still much hot and comfy? I think there’s a grammar error here.
Dont worry guys, it gets good at around 55:00
JESUS CHRIST KURZGESAGT, ONE HOUR???
This would make a epic animated wallpaper, though I'm not sure if Wallpaper Engine would accept a video this big.
i wonder how many "props to the cameraman" comments they're gonna be under this video, 4.5 billion perhaps?
The soundtrack reminds me of Voyage 34 by Porcupine Tree.
Alrighty then.... 1 hour... grabs popcorn.
it's giving @melodysheep 'timelapse of the entire universe' but longer and cooler, w the animation and all
Wow, just WOW You made my day!!
WTF 1 HOUR OF KURZGESAGT? I GOTTA BE DREAMING LMFAO
I can use this for the visuals of a house DJ set
Amazing point of view, thanks for this share.
Happy 10 years of explaining fax
Born too late to explore the world, and Born too early to explore the cosmos, but Born just in time to watch this masterpiece.
Thank you Kurzgesagt. The effort you guys put into these videos is nothing short of phenomenal!
Earth Making of a Planet - RoughneckGhost I remember watching that a long time ago!
Amazing video, and HUGE kudos to the composer(s) - the music evolved alongside the video and added an extra dimension to it without ever sounding repetitive or boring with the recurring theme. Insane work! :)
Wow, @Kurzgesagt, BRAVO!!!
AN HOUR!!!??? THIS MUST'VE FOREVER
This is single handedly healing my attention span. Thank you for this masterpiece!
X-Mas is early this year. One hour.
Damn the cameraman stronk tho
What a masterpiece, thank you Kurzgesagt <3
bill wurtz did it in 19 minutes smh (good video though)
This is one of my favorite video on youtube now.
This is freakin awesome!!
This is one of the greatest youtube achievements of all time! So much learning!
You're on a rock, floating in space
the fact that all of human history does not even fit within one second of this video is both so terrifying and incredible at the same time. we are living  just a fraction of earths history and yet we we have accomplished so much in such little time, just imagine the wonders we can only dream of achieving if given the right amount of time, I mean we are already looking outwards into the deep cosmos. just amazing stuff and an amazing video, well done to all the animators and the kurzgesagt team. :)
41:42 Ah yes, fun guy things, things that all fun guys do, i too be doing fun things with my funy tubular arms.
OLD STYLE IS BETTER
What font did you guys use for this? It looks good!
Your content is Dope.
We need to talk about how Epic Mountain made a 1 hour long constantly evolving soundtrack for this
Please do more episodes like this!! Love the animation and the music! Would love to hear something like Winter by Overwerk. Feels very ethereal, but that is the beauty of our universe!
cants wait to sleep to this
If I only had this before geology degree
@kurzgesagt, there is an video export error around 29:43 - 29:44. other than that, this was amazing to see and learn about !
I actually could not believe it when I saw this was uploaded. This is beautiful.
How can it suddenly begin to rain in the Eoarchean?
Goooodddd damnnnnnnnnnnn!
Props to all the ancient gods and deities for having such good background music for early life to evolve and vibe to
The music for this is fantastic!! The perfect thing to put on in the background while working on other things~
Why don’t other planets get water like earth 🌍
This is a brilliant format! You guys are the best!
What is that animal at 57:25?
I see a lot of people tripping through this video
As of this instant, 55 minutes after the release of this video, it is physically impossible that anyone on the earth has watched the video in its entirety
You should make a creationist version of this video that is a fraction of a second long
Awesome!
props to the cameraman, he did his best from start to finish, give him a raise.
you guys, this is so fucking cool and impressive I'm so grateful for you, keep up the great work
Beautiful work!
1 hour in 4.5 billion years.
It's funny how the shorter one of Earth's time periods is, the more that happens within it. Humans have been a thing less than a million years and have done more to change this planet within that time than anything short of an asteroid or protoplanet crashing into it.
I'm high and this is literally the best thing that ever exist ed
You blink You lose 100 Million years   of your life
Somewhere else on the internet, a sheep gave us a 10 minute musical journey through the Universe’s history. Now some birds gifted us an hour of Earth’s.
Can I get the sound track? 😬
First Kurzgesagt movie!?
Earth went through so many phases, its mom just gave up and said: "Ok, don't come crying to me when you catch the humanity virus."
💖💖💖 WOW 💖💖💖
great work! also, the music is superb!
The I've been looking for
An hour long Kurzgesagt video? I AM HYPED!
This would honestly make a great desktop background 💯
<3
Just imagine, sometime within those billions of years aliens could have came to earth seen that it was uninhabitable and left never knowing what it would become.
super
How could you know?
the amazing music from epic mountain sure made the Boring Billion quite entertaining!
Just saw they recently used a robot to disturb (turn rocks over) the soil near those vents and discovered even more life (worms etc). Awesome video as always!
its great to see how the artstyle and scope of your videos keep evolving, also i loved the deadmau5-esque soundtrack and the upgraded and more detailed style of animation.. great content as always
17:55 The green colour isn't just the art. In an atmosphere without oxygen, erosion of iron in the ocean as Fe2+ ions, stains the oceans a green colour. After photosynthesis, the green Fe2+ is oxidized by Oxygen in brown Fe3+, creating the Banded Iron Formations you see in 27:45   30:20 photosynthesis by Cyanobacteria removes so much CO2, a greenhouse gas, from the atomsphere that it sends the whole earth into global cooling, an event known as Snowball Earth.
1 hour of 4k animation, they have no idea what they just unleashed upon the 4am house after hours community god blessssss
Not even an hour in and already 125k views. Keep putting out content like this and you’ll have 4.5Billion views by the time this channel is done!
This video should be mandatory in our educational systems.
1 hour!!! Kurzgesagt has outdone themselves this time😂
Thank you, Kurzgesagt🥺 (hard work pays off!)
Thank you so much Kurzgesagt, awesome work.
Dont tell the creationists about this one!
I saw the title I was curious to see if this video would be better than the extremely popular "the entire history of Earth I guess"
I was JUST looking at endless wikipedia articles about geographic and paleo history yesterday, it is truly beautiful, things that are too vast to fit in one picture.
thats 1181102 years per second  insane
I wonder how big the tides where in the archeon since the moon was closer.
no way you made an hour long video.
Very Cosmos-esq with the Vangellis type synth. This would have been amazing with Alpha being played.
We need an 10 hours version to also include the big bang aliens, our ancestors!
That’s cool! Now do from the Big Bang to now in one hour!
<3 Thank you for this video. 4.5 billion years in an hour of awesome animation? Truly incredible, kurzgesagt on a Friday rocks! 00:00 🌎 The Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and its entire history is compressed into a one-hour video to illustrate the vastness of geological time. 00:30 🌋 Early Earth, just after formation, was a molten hellscape, colliding with Theia to form the Moon. 01:06 🔥 The Hadean eon, characterized by a CO2-rich atmosphere and lava-covered surface, is mostly undocumented in geological history. 02:11 🌧️ Despite a dimmer Sun, Earth's high greenhouse gas levels kept it warm, possibly with early water and heavy asteroid bombardment. 07:19 🧫 The emergence of life, possibly near hydrothermal vents, occurs just a few hundred million years after Earth's formation. 13:31 ⏱️ Earth's days were shorter in its early history due to faster rotation. 17:39 🪨 Stromatolites provide some of the earliest evidence of life on Earth. 18:00 🌞 The onset of photosynthesis marks a significant evolutionary development. 18:22 🌍 The Mesoarchean era witnesses the beginning of continental formation and tectonic activity. 19:14 🚫 Early Earth's atmosphere lacked oxygen, making it inhospitable for humans. 24:35 🦠 Prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet, showing increased biodiversity. 28:04 🌬️ The Great Oxidation Event introduces oxygen into the atmosphere, paving the way for complex life. 30:16 ❄️ The planet experiences its first ice ages due to the cooling effects of atmospheric changes. 34:11 ⛰️ Formation of early mountain ranges and continents like Ur, Nena, or Atlantica. 37:03 🌐 The supercontinent Columbia forms, and natural nuclear reactions occur due to uranium deposits. 39:43 🧬 The emergence of Eukaryotic cells, a major evolutionary milestone, occurs approximately 1.6 billion years ago. 42:17 🌏 The Earth's inner core begins to solidify around 1.4 billion years ago. 45:04 💞 The organism Bangiomorpha pubescens possibly invents sexual reproduction. 50:08 🛡️ The emergence of unicellular predators and an arms race among microbes. 53:15 🐟 The Cambrian explosion marks the rapid diversification of life and the advent of major animal groups. 56:43 🌋 The largest mass extinction in history occurs in the Permian period, caused by volcanic activity. 57:33 🦕 The rise of dinosaurs begins in the Triassic period. 59:38 🌳 Mammals rise to prominence after the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago. 01:00:30 🕒 Human history, by comparison, is just a blink in Earth's long timeline.
Amazing video the amount of effort is outstanding, 👍
This must've been hell to render
It took less than one second for us to pollute the Earth in the entire 1 hour of history :(
1 hour?  Omg this is real?  OMG IT IS REAL!
This is what i will show my kids chapters later
i like the fact that the chapters of the video reflect earths history
thank you for these videos! love all the effort you guys put into bettering our understanding of the world
this is a pretty cool video
history if the entire world, I guess
No ferinheight conversation? Can't always favor the Europeans.
Naw the moon slowly cooling off in the background was cool af
The mesoarchean gives me some real doom vibes.
"Settle in....this will take a while" And it indeed took a while
But isnt the world 6000 years old? Juuuuust kidding ;)
A version without the music would be cool as well, just to take in the atmosphere a bit better
I love that you can literally watch this video in the background when you go off the YouTube app on mobile
Put your headphones on and enjoy!
now i understand why u didnt upload. worth it tho
The transitions are great
This is so cool!
I saw the title and still didn't realise it eas going to be a 1 hour video. This is cinema!
God.. if i am a billionaire, i sure would do so much fascinating stuff. One of the first things i would do is to make a whole documentary of this, exactly the same concept, with kurzgesagt narrating, but i would hire high-end vfx/cgi artists to make some realistic immersive visuals. It would be so awesome
It's only been 55 minutes and more than 100k views! Holy crap! Congrats!
Wow! Very cool video!
History of the world i guess 2.0
I think the fact we did not see a single animal on screen for the first 3/4ths of this video is really telling in regards to just how long it took for us to finally come into existence, and how much of a miracle it really is
But my neighbor told me the worlds only 6000 years old and I'm going to hell when I die.
Consider that over the course of millions of years, fire elementals probably roamed the planet at least once! 😅
Awesome soundtrack reminds me of daft punk
really dig the soundtrack for this video, well done!
You WHAT
thats a long ass video
1 hour Kurzgesagt video? I must be dreaming
Everyone is freaking out over this 1 hour long animation but forgot that my friend Kevin can do this every day
Kinda crazy how God put on such an elaborate show for Him and His angels for billions of years without us even being there to witness it. Like a rock concert or smth and we're too underaged to get in.
in the Eoarchean period the detail layer on top of the puddles doesn't move until 10:40
This is amazing. Thanks to the kurzgesagt team for doing such a wonderful job and putting so much passion into this video.
I'm sorry they made a WHOLE FSM DAMN HOUR OF ANIMATION? AT THIS QUALITY??? You've truly outdone yourselves this time!
Really fun your trying something different. But one question, where did the first rainstorm from. Btw love this new kind of video ❤❤❤
This is actually insane. I don't even wanna start to imagine how long this must've taken. Really well done guys!
Another great video!
This is absolutely amazing and so well done. I’m flabbergasted 🤯. Thank you so much for sharing this with us all for free. I love it!!
44:59 banging algae f'cked around and found out
I can’t imagine how much time this took
Please do more videos like this one it is awesome and beautiful .🤯
are you planning on releasing a more condensed version for those of us that don't have an hour to waste listening to music waiting for your next information dump?
early to life gang
wanted to see across the spiderverse but i think this is more important
this is absolutely incredible, especially since this is a FULL HOUR OF ANIMATION AND ORIGINALLY COMPOSED MUSIC. This is craazy
God dey create abeg 🎉🎉🎉 What a wonderful video
Animation & Visualization is insane
80 years is really a blink of an eye
Wow I absolutely love it! cant watch it all right now but this is the best visualization for Time. Not big numbers but comparison on a scale a human can understand. I would have liked a  few more explainations on why things are happening as they are.
dat beat drop tho
But the world has only existed for 6000 years😢
Even though I dont believe in evolution this is still a bangar.
got some vibing background music along with the occasional historical fact
This is the greatest 1 hour vid ive ever seen
Sheeeeeeeeesh 🌎
This is not a video, it's an experience.
Brilliant work
Put the video in 2x to have 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes
Yeah I've watched history of the enitre world, i guess
No words can give this masterpiece justice
1 hour of serious bangers while travelling through earth history. Beware of neck pain.
1 hour of Kurzgesagt, couldn’t wish for a better video😍
water just spawning out of the space sounds like a load of bs.
Bro i thought it was for 14 minutes but ... im literally shocked to see 1 hour. 1 FREAKING HOUR!??! the animation production team is super huge i guess
missed oppertunity to call this video "the history if the entire world i guessagt"
A bit depressing that we (humans) are still nothing but a footnote - a blink and you miss it - event.
1:00:44 god I loved that
Watching stuff like this really takes me back to the good old days. I remember being young and full of energy back in those crazy Mesoarchean days. Oh the nostalgia, it’s a powerful thing.
Came for the geology. Stayed (and came again) for ze German techno-pop.
Hello
But wait. An old book told me the earth is only 7000 years old. Wake up sheeple! Don't believe what big pharmacy want you to see
so this is the history of the entire world, i guess
kinda boring after the netflix show
What I love most: a discussion of all the phases that are normally glossed over. It's a much clearer picture of Earth's development than usual!
Looks like earth had been through boring times, I hope he had TikTok back then
I find it funny how the Mesoarchean period got a DOOM-style colour pallet, as well as a DOOM-like leitmotif to go with its track
45:07 bruh ☠️. I needed to needed on x1.25  Edit: 2019 holy sh*t thank you soo much  It was soo worth it watching this mega project i need to confess i skipped mennx times but only some thimes were you weren't speaking or were the background changed but it was beautiful
Killer soundtrack ❤
The visuals, the awesome music... Beautiful 😍  You really poured all of your passion and love for us fans into this awesome 1 hour project. Thank you Kurzgesagt team! 🥰
If you squint it becomes even crazier
no one has watched the full video yet so people commenting before me mst have scrolled down just to comment before the video was over
Ojalá que pronto lo saquen en español
Had a conversation with someone recently and they told me the earth was 10,000 years old :/ I respect their views but man that just doesn’t make any sense at all
I’ve seen an old education video on this and to have kurzgesagt make their own is just 😭😭😭
3:50 YO the music absolutely SLAPS starting from here onwards
the graduation in development and the design as whole is wonderfully amazing no wonder it took time to make but its masterpiece well done!
Lol, by now most of us haven’t even finished watching it.
Just awesome
I am just a galaxy.
Composer went crazy on this one
This channel is definitely in the top 5 best youtube channels
Absolute banger video. Thank you. Been having an awful last 2 weeks and I really needed something like this to take my mind off things.
music for sleeping
gyaattt
you should release all this moments as high res wallpapers from past present future videos >
Love this!!!
Where can i find more about the music used in the video?
Pov; mom goes to go get something in the supermarket and the cashier gets to you
It was good overall. but why were there algae doing disappearing acts?
How is it that this video is released right when I started getting interested in this stuff? Thank you so very much
Soundtrack is absolutely sick blasting it out loud rocking away to the soundtrack to Evolution. 10/10
my mind has just been blown
It has not been an hour and people are commenting
I LOVE THIS
Hold on this IS astounding and I´m astonished
one of the best way to productify yourfree time
Simply incredible
I have always watched your videos since your first ever one! I always come here to watch and learn about our world, science, the universe or to just be in awe at the topics they bring. I absolutely adore you and will remain till for all your anniversaries to get quality content like this! ❤❤
This was some beautiful animation, you guys are really starting to use color to it's fullest
thats is a whole pixar movie worth of animation you bet i will watch in in cinemas
lol: "Much hot and comfy"
The opening sound track has a progressive EDM vibe, came for the science, stayed to dance.
if you set it to 2x speed then it would be 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes
A 1 hour animation, couldn't believe the notification until i saw the video, kurzgesagt you treat us too good, gotta buy some merch
There's a 360 theatre in Atlanta that wpuld be really cool if it played this
29:43 a small glitch in the Matrix
30:33 btw this is so ik where im at
Gotta say the music is fire.
This is Just Gold...
Genuinely one of the coolest animated movies on YouTube
Cudos to the people who scored the music
At the beggining i thought this was just a compilation . It wasn’t 🤯
never in a million years had i thought about 1 hour of kurzgezagt content
Best Revision soundtrack this decade, love to see it ❤
Mejor canal de youtube del mundo 🚬🚬
I love how the earth is getting destroyed by meteors and is covered in lava and the house music just goes crazy
❤
Wow this is like the greatest thing ever! A hr long Kuttzagar..kurzgazagat....kurz....IN A NUTSHELL video!!!
Wow, this have take years to make
This soundtrack is mindblowing
Thats amazing omg
This is the prequel to "history of the entire world, i guess"
Now, do the history of the universe in a hour.
Yes this is top quality science content and this is why kurzgesagt are one of the best science channel.  Hopefully they focus more on this type of stuff in the future and not the poor political/climate change stuff ,that brings them so much in heat and I think mostly rightly so.
This isnt a video... Kurzgesagt just dropped a mixtape. 🔥🔥🔥
4:30 Wow, the details! You can see comets striking the Moon. Only white flashes on the surface are visible. None of the actual comets are visible, because of the distance, and no streaks behind the comets, because the Moon has no atmosphere.
Serious War of the World's vibes from the music at points. Amazing
happy 10 years 🎉💗
Kurzgesagt: makes a full dedicated 1 hour long video showing the evolution of earth and humanity.  Christians: nu-uh
This is actually rlly interesting to watch. Been watching for years, I'm still not bored
Finally - There's a worthy sequel to "history of the world, I guess"
I wish this had a temperature gauge in the other corner so we can see the fluctuations of hot and cool on earth over 4.5 billion years!
You guys are just a amazing YouTube channel
Uhh, are you guys fucking kidding me w/ this amazing video? Thank you!
Bull Wurtz did it first
It’s nice an all but did you ever see bill wurtz?
beautiful truly!!!
Love the video, maybe also a version without talking?
Just awesome !
coolest video on youtube! Honestly never stop creating theese types of videoes. Love from Norway
how time passes 1 second before you die:
Genius
This is annoying asf
1 hour of Kurz’s animations? Ah hell yeah.
so far, noone has legitimately completed this video
53:37 is where is starts to get interesting
I need a wallpaper engine version of this and I need it yesterday.
C'est juste incroyable, bravo a vous.
Omg 1 hour of kurzgesagt
Wow! Full featured movie, insane
This is the equivalent of six 10 minute videos of yours - great job!
The music is underrated. Not only is it really good, but it’s calming, the transitions are seemless, go along with the images, and it doesn’t overpower the narrator. I am unironically adding this to my music playlist.
Props to the camera man for recording for 4.5 billion years straight without fail 🙏
Today just got a whole lot better.
New watch while high video
Earth lore:
19:41 I hear it...
I saw the glitch in the Siderian, was intentional?
1 hour of Kurzgesagt is what I needed and I didn't know it ☺️
here before 1 hour
props to the cameraman
In the first stage, would the crust and the mantle still be separate or would they be one mass of magma?
20,000th like 👍 incredible movie, can’t believe it’s free
this should be put in a giant screen in a large museum about the theme of what was going on billions of years ago You can't just upload so much good stuff to YouTube and expect to get away with it 👊
2 minutes in  & I give you an artist round of applause  Unless it ends poorly  If that happens I'll delete this
Less than 1 hour crew 👇🏼
Kurzgesagt Es ist immer toll, eure Videos anzuschauen und anzuhören, und sie lösen immer eine Art existentielle Angst oder Krise aus. Ich liebe es immer, neue Videos anzuschauen :D
Ok guys here's the deal:  -lower the speed in half -mute the video -open your music player in another tab -softly blast some dark academia or whatever on the background -return and use this video as a screensaver of sorts  this might be the best study set up i have ever seen aaaaaaa
:O
Love this perspective. Thanks
still nobody watched it all and... 1.703 comments
Kurzgesagt allways knoks it out of the park with their videos
huge
1h of kurzgesagt is actually crazy
holy hell a 1 hour kurgesagt video . yay
This train we rode in this video must have been extraordinarily durable, in addition to containing a ridiculous amount of fuel to have lasted 4.5 billion years.
Just amazing. Thank you guys. Your videos definitely make my life better.
This video made me wanna play through Subnautica again and I've no idea why
I love the Daft Punk-esque music in the background. Props to the sound team.
FOR FREE?
LOG SCALES ARE FOR QUITTERS WHO CAN'T FIND ENOUGH HISTORY TO MAKE THEIR POINT PROPERLY.
All of the human history in a blink of an eye, humans must have escaped a nuclear war on Mars before that 💀
What a perfect jam ❤
Ok but the beat slaps too
The music is SO good ong
This is like a more digestible version of Bill Wurtz video
In the vast expanse of cosmic time, A tale unfolds in animated rhyme. Kurzgesagt, a beacon bright, In the realm of YouTube's captivating light.  Four and a half billion years, compressed, In one hour's span, a journey blessed. A cosmic odyssey, a visual delight, Unraveling the mysteries of the starry night.  Animated wonders, colors ablaze, Scientific marvels in vibrant displays. From primordial soup to life's grandeur, Every chapter, a visual splendor.  Evolution dances in frames so fine, A tale of survival, a grand design. Creatures emerge, from the depths they crawl, Each chapter a testament, a story enthralled.  The Earth, a stage for nature's play, In the grand theater of night and day. Oceans deep and mountains high, A symphony of life beneath the sky.  Extinction's shadow, a poignant theme, Yet from the ashes, life does gleam. Dinosaurs roam, then fade away, But life persists in a resilient ballet.  Humanity rises, a conscious spark, A journey through history, both light and dark. Science unfolds, knowledge ascends, As the cosmos whispers, its secrets it sends.  In a Nutshell, the universe revealed, A poetic saga, on screens unsealed. Kurzgesagt, with each frame, imparts, The wonders of existence, in animated arts.  So let us dive into this cosmic sea, Four and a half billion years, let it be. A voyage through time, in visual power, In the realm of Kurzgesagt, our cosmic hour.
no one has finished this video on 1x speed yet it came out 45 mins ago welldone to kurzgesagt
This is off topic but your game on the meta quest was very fun and education! Thank you for making it!
4.5 billion years in an hour of awesome animation? Truly incredible, kurzgesagt on a Friday rocks!
I have to thank all of you again. This is amazing. For free yet! Thank you for all the enjoyment you give me.
This would go crazy in a waiting room
This video has the same vibe as a game of terraria
29:41 glitchy video
Y’all’s dedication is absolutely inspiring. I’m gonna channel this into my creative projects ❤
I love and appreciate the linearity of time passing. Not skipping helps convey how long everything was
Im glad these guys are doing longer form content since thier animation and way of explaining things makes you just interested in the topic. In a regular 18 minute video I always wish there were more and well here we are
Incredible. We'll done
Jamming out to this one forsure 🎵🎶
I’ve been watching the channel since the start and it’s amazing how the animation has changed over the years
Great idea!
6 minutes in and I upvoted already, just because of the music, artstyle and honestly just the idea. Love the concept.
Everyone talking about the animation and I'm here bopping to the choons!
I can't believe half an hour went this fast with barely any commentary
early me
Kurzgesagt managing to pull this masterpiece off is mind-boggling yet amazing!
i finshed the video without skiping
It's taken us 4.5 Billion Years, but we'll win.
Fiery water, fields of ice, a body of salt water so big that the merchants could take the salt their whole lives and never get it all out.
Should have been more commentary
The Hadean soundtrack rules. Can I buy that somewhere?
This animation is amazjng, I'm guessing that this must have been one of your hardest projects, thank you so much for making videos like this for us kirzgesagt!
So cool how Mars or the Moon in the background is slowly cooling as well.
This was released 46 minutes ago YALL DID NOT WATCH THE WHOLE THING
music past 31:00 had me boppin starting at rocks. not how i thought i'd spend my friday evening
Everyone impressed by the scrolling animation while I’m loving the soundtrack lol
Watching the heat, distort the image of the moon, wow these guys literally thought about every detail. Beautiful.
This isn’t all of history. You forgot the part where I shit myself this morning making breakfast
insane. whatever our entire lineage of ancestors experienced was not even a full second within this video
I need a crapload of popcorn for this....
Wow! Can't wait to watch whole video. Gotta grab some snacks.
Fantastic
Another banger from Kurzgesagt as expected
At a utter loss of words for how impressed and thankful I am for these videos.
🎵🎶it's the CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION
Awesome job kurzgesagt team, splendid time with this. You legit made it well
Watching this for free feels almost illegal
This that GTA Online heist music
I'd like everyone to imagine the DREAD the animation team must've felt when they heard "soyeah, we need an HOUR of animation" and then the relief they felt when this thing got uploaded. well done.
love this
“The sun was a deadly laser!”
Our world needs communities like you guys🥹🥰
I'm sure, that if I tried to study to this, I would spend the whole hour watching the awesome animations
This might be one of my new favourite videos on youtube
Not even all the way through but the Mesoarchean is so metal 22:41- 23:09
The countdown in the corner should update every 0.666 seconds (20 frames at 30fps), but seems a bit slower and with an unsuitable font (digits are not same width causing the leading digits to bounce around) .
Clicked for the science, stayed for the 4.5 billion year trance groove session.
History of the entire world i guess vibes
this is the type of content you watch at 2 am because you don’t want to sleep
This vid and exactly with the music genre I listen to most 🤩
All of it
here in under a hour :D
The moon slowly becoming smaller and cooler as time passes, what attention to detail!!!!
It’s 4.5 Billion years in 30 minutes if you watch at 2x
[F]_<mx> (MABS) => {omega(x,t) , output_2 , output_3
Holy cow 1h!? You guys are insane in the best way possible
In the credits of the movie of earth humanity isnt even a janitor
What a nonsense. God created Earth 6000 years ago.
Crazy guys love your work ❤
Never thought Kurzgesagt would make a 1hr video considering how much effort it takes. You have my respect 🫡
i just shaoked when i saw 1 hour video from kurzgesagt.
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo when's the soundtrack gonna be available in the merch store??
So a 5 second Ad equal to a 7,500,000 years 🤔, it sure feels like this
It's fascinating that the entire history of humanity lasts less than half of a second in this video.
YOOOOOO
What a wonderful science fiction fairytale story!
the beginning is wallpaper
i bet you this is going to be one of the most famous educational videos every uploaded
An hour of misinformation and scientism propaganda
Only my beloved German science, duck that I love so much, can make five minutes of animated meteors look amazing. I am literally watching this, and still glued to my screen at all the animated meteors. How can I not. Just beautiful.
Amazing video! Thank you for your efforts, we really apreaciate it :)
The hadean  period feels like world 8 of New Super  Mario Bros Wii. Especially with the music.
Bill wurtz +
In about the last frame of the video, as 60 frames per second, humanity created civilization, discovered the Earth, innovated over thousands of technological achievements, discovered fossil fuels, went to the Moon, and then destroys itself. In one 60th of a second.
Imagine all the species of prokaryotic and eukaryotic life that existed, evolved, competed, and went extinct over the billions of years before multicellular life took hold.  So much information and variety in that ecosystem that has been permanently lost.
The Music❤👌
WHAT A 1 hour kurzegesagt video?! This might not be the dark timeline after all
29:43 why did it glitch???
"Must've been beautiful. But also boring"
He said it, the floor is lava !  1:36
Kurzgesagt is an invaluable resource. What you guys continue to do blows my mind... and gives me hope that more people will use social media and their online presences to put something back into the World that benefits humanity rather than selfishly exploiting it for their own personal gain.
Best video you've ever done.  Gonna loop this in my office and the next time my dumbass coworker says, "evolution is ridiculous" I'll make him watch this.  Great video for conceptualizing time. Thank you.
فَبِأَيِّ آلاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذ ِبَانِ Which, then, of your Lord's blessings do you both deny?
I'm watching this 4.5 billion years after this video started to go into production.
Kurzgesagt where did you get the music from?
Crazy to think that if they remake this video in about a thousand years, it doesn't change the runtime.
Sound track is amazing ❤
Oh my god, this is the perfect summary ❤ Hundreds hours of reading and watching video's in just one hour!😍
This animation quality is INSANE! Keep up the great work!
Can we appreciate the cameraman who had to travel back in time to be able to capture this masterpiece and endure all the disasters 🫡👏
If you don't have enough time to watch this, start from 53:40.  It is genuinely beautiful from there.  (The whole thing is beautiful, it's just better from there)
amazing
AMAZING!
Have an 1 hour flight today. This is perfect! Thank you
This is Art.
History of everything I guess 2.0?
Incredible
This should have been more like a documentary with more speaking
I don't know what I've done to earn an hour of kurzgesagt, because I haven't behaved, but im very excited.
Thanks to the immortal cameraman
Wow this really puts into perspective just how long the previous periods were
I was expecting an extended Bill Wurst song lol
I'm going to put this as my live wallpaper on my pc, I love this soo much ❤. Keep up the great work!
I love the beat that starts at 16:30
the craziest thing for me is that this video pops up right after i had decided to rewatch "History of the world i guess" from bill wurtz
Incredible! What a great great video. Even the music was  beautiful and matching. A pearl on the the internets. Chapeau
19:40 Doom intensifies!
This is amazing how your team made this masterpiece i love it ❤
Amazing
No one watched it whole
The fact we get premium features for this video without yt premium just shows how much the community and youtube love this channel.
Eat the sun, using revolutionize technology Photosynthesis (tm)
1 hour of misinformation
This is not "in a nutshell" 😂😂😂😂😂😂  But I'm here for it 🎉🎉🎉
this is the video i never expected but i enjoyed it keep up with the hard work!
Reminds me of playing Spore when I was a child
An hour long Kurzgesagt video?!  I'm so happy!!
the history of the entire world I guess
A full hour-long production. Amazing!
to think that the whole of human civilization represents 0.01 seconds of an hour long video. we truly are insignificant in a geological time scale. and the universe is over 3 times older than that.
Appreciate the time
Thanks for the effort and the work that went into this Video! Amazing animation 🙌 But that doesn’t work with me, I think Someone above created you and me ✌️😬
You have officially created the best wallpaper to have ever existed
I can't wait for the Spanish dub to show it to my wife
This is what ive needed my entire life
Outstanding 👏👏👏👏
Bill Wurtz would be so proud of you
Finally… the perfect video to watch while eating
This is Amazing! Thank you Kurzgesagt ❤
oh wow 1 hour long video
2:39 🤯
Awesome music and visuals. This must’ve taken so much effort from so many people.
The music reminds me of Star Control 2
Lofies to chill while eons are passing
This is really cool I bet it was expensive as hell to make this I would like a endless stream version of this But without the narrator's voice popping in from time to time
Everyones praising the animators but I see nobody talking about the music. Really good transitions and ambient sounds between the eras.
A WHOLE HOUR OF ANIMATION? FOR FREE? god i love kurzgesagt
We don't deserve you.
😮
I've seen this video about 1 billion dollars visualised by Reckful (rip). Imagine those are years, times 4.5! Holy shit.
55:50 found that asshole that caused this whole mess.
Amazing.
Don't go grab a beverage or you miss the dinosaurs!
can't wait for the sequel in 45000002023
7:20 "much hot"?
who is watching in 4.500.000.001 ?
1:34 I’d easily survive
this is amazing
1 second of human history, wow
The bg music is a banger. Makes me wanna bust a move while working
wow
THE FLOOR IS LAVA!!!
This is the most beautiful test of attention span
I am speechless   Just finished the whole video, most importantly didn't blink in human portion 😜   Thank you @KURZGESAGT for this beautiful gift. ❤
W kurzgesagt post!!!
Very nice
You just lowkey dropped an hour long Kurzgesagt video like it was no big deal? I'm gonna have to go donate to you guy's patreon after this...
The music occasionally sounds like Jarre, which i like.
Great video 👍🔝
Camera man did one for the team filmed the timelapse for 4.5 Billion years. Goated.
Kurzgesagt its my birthday today
wow as of the time of this post no one has finished the video wihout fastforwarding
Shoutout to the cameraman who went back in time to film this entire video🗿
I'm going to have to save this for later, I love Kurzgesagt but 1 hour is a little hard to swallow for any video if I'm not ready to sit down to watching a movie
wat
This is my favorite or your videos yet. I love the chill aspect of it. And I can't imagine how long it took to animate. Thank to everyone who worked on it!
This is what i needed
Can you guys do a video on stem cells?
Can you guys please make a version where the parts where nothing much happens are like sped up? No pressure, I know how much time all this takes :)
Hey hey hey, we're witnessing history here quite literally. I swear, this is peak YouTube content right here.
Some people lean back and pop on some Floyd, Kurzgesagt chills with Earth: The Anthology
Fucking Awesome. 👏👏👏
This suits for an excellent wallpaper engine!
Where's collision with Thea?
Hey @kurzgesagt ! I hope you could post all of the music onto YouTube, since they’re all truly great! Love it
I think I've never felt so small yet so comfortable at the same time
6,000*
We need more of this!
1 hour of content, wow
I like how you can slowly see the moon getting further and further away.
Babe, grab the popcorn! In a nut shell just dropped a movie
First hour gang 😤(love your videos 💙)
I am determined not to skip through, but the Hadean part is REALLY testing my patience 😂
amazing stuff
Nearly 2000 comments in 40 minutes, not one of these people has watched the whole video smh
Damn the animation production really stepped up.
i cant believe kurtzgesagt got me to sit in my couch for 4.5 billion years
Absolutely fantastic, I love the soundtrack to accompany the video too!
After watching this whole thing...i'm amazed at how far they've came (I am aware this hour long video came out 20 minutes ago)
Great job on the animation guys, really
I remember that time in 2018 when I was 8 I was watching Earth's story on National Geographic and then I discovered Kurzgesagt. I think I saw the channel grow. I never expected this. I am pretty sure future people like me will see this video and be in awe about all the wonderful things our universe can show us. Thank you Kurzgesagt. 😊
Had the wildest dream listening to this.
What an amazing video, I'll admit I made heavy use of the fast-forward feature for the first 3.5 Billion years while trying my best not to miss the cool info tidbits but the whole thing was great, I'll probably listen to it again one evening while focusing on something else or going to sleep :3
End credits song is very good
This entire video really encapsulates the entirety on how long human kind has been on earth. Really love how it was the longest part out of it all. 🤗         Jokes aside though this is really amazing and this had to have taken months, if not years. Plus it is really good animation, and my favorite part is the moon.
Damm that opening synth riff is great, very Flume like!
You guys deserve way more than one like per viewer
The gaps with music and animation was gold. So good for sleep.
Okay, thats awesome
No flippin' way you guys made a one hour video, that must've took forever!
Its so absurd that until minute 53 there is just barley life and then it just goes wild
This is nothing compared to the actual cosmological time span and events. Infinitely boring years of nothing followed by a few seconds of stuff happening and then back to years of boring nothing.
i was not expecting this to be so long
Just when you think you know how big 4.5 billion years is, Kurzgesagt proves that no, you in fact do not.
epic mountain knocked it out of the park with this one, can we respect their efforts in making a 1 hour long ost for a single youtube video AND having it sound this good and varied throughout the whole experience?
i was here
This must be the biggest weight off your shoulders
Dam this mustve been one hell of a project to make.. 12 minutes usually take weeks to make.. but an hour…. Holy..
you bastards spoil us
Born to late to explore the world.  Born to early to explore the universe.  Born just in time to watch an 1 hour long Kurgesagt video
This is incredible, thank you so much ❤🙏
loved it
While the Hadean period passes, I might as well look at the comments lol
1 hour of animation for free? In this economy? I have no words it's a bliss❤️
dam under 40 minutes gang klets go
This is cool, but I wouldn’t be surprised is it actually took less time to make than their standard videos.   This video probably used some level of procedural animation while their normal stuff likely requires a lot of hands on work.
1:02:12 the illustrator has a very good birb
My favorite part is when the song goes from BEEP BOO BOO BOO BOOP, to DEN DUN DON DUN DON
God pulls up Imma bout to end this man’s whole career
Someone did this in 20mins, with better jingles hahaha
After effects after rendering this video💥💥💀
I have been waiting for this moment for years
This is incredible
I wish this was like a default setting for television backgrounds, so you could just watch this everytime your bored
Salute your hardwork ❤❤❤❤
1 HOUR OF ANIMATING??? Thank you Kurz team!!!!
My brain: "How far into this are we?" Checks and it's halfway. "We're halfway and not a lot has happened." Also my brain: "yup."
I feel like I've uncovered the secrets of the universe watching this
ggggggggggggggggg
okay now THIS is *long*
wow ive never seen a kurzgesagt video that is one hour
WE MAKIN' IT OUT OF 4.5 BILLION YEARS WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🥶🥶
HOLY SHIT THIS IS LONG ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL
this is one of the best videos on youtube!!!
1 Hour of Kuzr animation . . . Am i on heaven ?
Omg that meteorite scene and the gaps are soo addictive 😍
oh lord..
the video is soo good
entire history of the world, i guess
Sure, I'll watch the Moon dry with Epic Mountain in the background for 10 minutes
This is some real anti tiktok training lol 😂, jokes aside great video guys
Wake up babe, the kurzgasagt movie just dropped
1:36 "And the floor is lava"
1:00:41 in cased you missed all of human history
4.5 billion years of backround music ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
props to the camera man for recording all of this
If it's a kurzgesagt video, I'm giving a like without clicking on the video 😎
This is just... Wow. Kurzgesagt started with quality and it's skyrocketing to perfection.
After seeing yalls video on how you make videos, I can’t even begin to imagine how long this video took to make. Incredible.
29:42 "...which _rapidly_ cools the planet down" - by "rapidly",  they mean tens of millions of years?
At first i didn't really think about the fact that a second in this video is longer than most of human existence
My god I didn't expect this, lemme grab my popcorn
GOOD Vibes
And here I'm on history's timeline, making a comment
58:12 Jurassic park reference!
hi
a video in the making for 4 yrs is incredible. happy 10th anniversary as well.   and shoutout to Johanna Kanzler over at the production team! great video as always
Holy crap, nicely done K!
At this point, another version of this video without commentary is very needed, spectacular music combined with the stunning visuals, so therapeutic.
Hi I did not see this video coming good idea
Holy Moly! This is an early Christmas gift. 😊
Kurgesagt to relax/study to
To everyone at kurzgesagt, thank you
The music slaps !!!
The mad lads really made a feature film length video,
wow, 1h of video, i love Kurzgesagt content so lets see it the job on art is awesome as always
Important to keep in mind that, on the scale of this video, the blink of an eye (0.1s) is approximately 100,000 years which is still 10x more time than all of human recorded history.
okay but where is the great extinction due to the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere?
This is amazing. Like, genuine ART.  I’m so proud of the team.
This is insane
Bill wurtz has been real quiet since this dropped
You never cease to amaze us!
Perfect video to watch at 1 in the morning
Wow
Well, this is the history of the entire world, i guess
Wooohooo, that's unbelievable, simply marvelous!
This is proof that the camera-man is eternal.
history of our planet in a nut shell
WOW.
This channel is just amazing, showing us all life, predictions, black holes, space size of things and history. This channel is my absolute favorite.
Has the theme for the 12,024 calendar been announced yet? If not, this should be it!
Amazing
😮
Wait... Isn't this like a song playlist for like the entire Earth history?
Your new game on quest is amazing Highly recommend If you love science Edit: if kurzgesagt reply’s or even likes my comment I’m gonna cry
This looks so good!
Are we on a rock floating through space?  How did this happen?
Beautifully done absolutely amazing 👌
KEEP IT UP this is awesomeee
Merry 10th anniversary kurzgesagt 13:40 you just watched 1 billion years 30:49 the screen effects feel very immersive 41:36 fungi do their things… 45:01 … 53:36 life finally forms, then mass extinction event happens right after 56:50 thanks, volcanos 57:40 a dinosaur 58:06 birds do bird things 59:40 nothing can go wron- 1:00:39 don’t blink
wow.. a 1 hour kurzgesagt video? YESSSS
And the floor is lava
A Kurzgebomb just dropped
What is this Wurtzgesagt?
I can call to this just real science love and dedication. Starting in 2019 and finishing it now isnt an easy thing (actually mind blowing).
What an awesome idea - i'll watch to the end i promise - would be cool to see a year counter from 0 too tho!
I'm in love with this sort of content. Thanks for the vid.
E
Oh my god i am actually amazed at this kurzgesagt! I love listening to you guys’ videos while i do homework or before i go to bed. I think i speak for everyone when i say that we appreciate this so much ❤
I love this idea! So important for understanding
Me who watched this at 2x speed
I am loving the music in background...
I'd love to have an official Kurzgesagt CD album with this long song...
Cant believe i am witnessing a 1 hour kurzgesagt video
I literally had this idea a couple days ago wow, can’t wait to finish the video !!
This video is the best thing on youtube right now. Thank you people of Kurzgesagt for this... ( and for letting us know that the Hadean was hot and comfy )
1 hour long? Am still gonna watch it
The fact this is free! Amazing work and animation ❤
The Eoarchean looks like a typical summer in the Netherlands.
This is hardly informative for people that have looked up Earth's history previously, missing lots of interesing periods, depicts Earth's environment in every era as uniform with no gradation for different climates, lacks relevant commentary - it's 90% silent animation. Maybe it's ok as an entry level animated infographic, but to me it's just a waste of time.
Metallica style double bass drum comes in around 23:00. That whole heavy segment has an overdriven bass riding that low F. Beautiful.
Turn this into a sidescrolling platformer!
it took you kurzgesagt a lot of time and effort I appreciate it
Please tell me I’m not the only one who thinks that the music in the first/second part of the video sounds like it’s from a gta heist
I have been watching this channel for quite some time and have loved it!! Keep up the good work!❤
🎵 The sun is a deadly laser 🎶
This is beautiful. Congrats to the production team 👏
im at a point i like their videos before i even watch them, bravo
nice now i have a regular thing to watch nd listen to when im in a code jam at least on of the ones i can use reliabily
Holy crap
1hr of Kurzgesagt? About earth's history? What a time to be alive!
Had to double check this is legit. 1 hour is crazzy good. Thank youuu!
Pov:you skipped 10 sec and 15000000 yrs 😂😂😂😂
We don't deserve you Kurzgesagt. I can't even imagine the massive work to produce this 1h animated video, and we can access it for free... Thank you so much.
Absolutely beautifull illustration as always.
It took me one billion years to eat my dinner! 😅
:)
Krgzt : 1 second is 1.5 million years  Me : well a 10 mins video will do  Krgzt : now lets star this 1 hr video  Me : ..........  Hellyeaaa letsgoooo
Am happy to watch an 1 hour of Kurzgesagt video for free
This is awesome but I noticed a glitch at about 29:30
Earth entire Lord in one video
During the 'floor is lava' era of Earth, how much force was all that radiating heat from the lava pushing the atmosphere outward with? And what effects has that had? How much activation energy was there in the atmosphere due to all this heat that could help with chemical reactions?
my head just cant comprehend ,,, and still im at mesoarchean
i have been full focus watching this for 25 minutes and i dont see myself stopping  Edit: i was right
History of the entire world (I'm no longer guessing)
I want this as a live wallpaper <3
1h Kurzgesagt video? You guys are a true treasure!
Bill Wurtz still holds the speedrun record...
This is incredible.  Want as a screensaver.
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!
This video must've taken 4.5 billion years to make lol
Que lástima que no este en español 😢 pero el hecho de que sea 1 hora es increíble
The animation is so beautiful, the sound effects are amazing, the narrator is so calm. This is a very quality video
Great video, i'm still in the Hadean but i love it
1 hour of kurzegesagt? What is this?! CHRISTMAS?
Once in 10 years ultra episode of 1hour . This is amazing 🤩🤩
did this channel just drop an *animated* video that is *one hour* long with *self made* music? I am BLOWN AWAY
How come the top right says million, not billion years?
Beautiful! I swear, any frame of this would make a killer desktop background.
Most impossible game of "the floor is lava" : 1:40.... How will you survive?
i wonder if anyone actually watched the full hour without skipping
Bro it's 12am
Every 10s we skip is 10million years of earths history
What software did you use to make these animations?
55:45 we get forrests!
How is this free?
My name is Giovani Georjo 6:11
Show your appreciation, press the like button, comment and help boost the algo
You guys wrote million years ago in the top right instead of billion
The sequel to History of the entire world, I guess
It's nuts how fast life started, and yet we haven't met anything else yet?!?!
1 HOUR OF KURZGESAGT'S VIDEO LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO This is truly blessing from Kurzgesagt
Happy 10th birthday, Kurzgesagt!
They honored Bill Wurtz
on 32nd minute
Hell yes, loves this fr  The existentialism... 🛐🛐
The title defies the laws of time
How long did this take to make???
The moon formed in only a few hours, not millions of years
Let's dive in, into the probably longest video of Kurzgesagt. I already aprecciate the effort.
That reminds me of the youtube channel melodysheep that made a 10 minutes video of the universe from the beginning to now It was a nice video, just like this one :) I'm sure everyone would love it! He made another video that shows the universe from now to the end of time and... it's terrifying, but beautiful 😊
damn those genius really made a one hour video
59:37 astroid kills the dinosaurs 🦖
can someone upload this to wallpaper engine?
There is so much effort put in this and I haven't even finished it yet.  Edit: Now finished. May I say the score on this video was immaculate.
This is insane
me -> :D
I challenge every tiktok user to watch this in one sitting, with no distractions
absolutely lovely, thank you so much for everything! keep up the good work!
Wow!
Probs for the Soundtrack
nah, this is way too complicated for my brain to understand. obviously it was created 5,000 years ago in 7 days
The entire history of "basically everything" put into a 1 hour animated video, is honestly crazy!💪🏻That's some true dedication!
This is..... amazing.
Aliens: You guy have about 63 minutes to introduce us about your planet Kurzgesagt: *Y E S*
Holy Moly!
Oh my god, you actually made this an hour long. You mad lads
there was also Ads in history of earth???
I am seriously shocked how you can just make an hour long video. Stunning
history of our solar system next!
Work and dance and dance and dance and work and prance and twerk and drop and dance and work and work and work 👠 the beat is so good!
Thanks for providing this pleasure for free
Amazing work!
Times flies so fast... 4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour. ❤❤❤
THE education Quadrouple: Kurzgesagt Oversimplified Bill Wurtz Mark Rober
Thanks! 4.7 billion times, 365 days, 24 hours, 60 minutes and the same and same. Take your time guys!
With this video you can see how insanley irrelevant humanity really is.
Big respect for the cameraman for filming for mor than 4.5 billion years
8:38 That's when Oregon was formed
ah yes, deep space and progressive house. A winner combo right there.
Babe wake up, kurzgesagt just dropped a movie…wait I don't have a girlfriend.
That Mesoarchean track is FIRE!!!!!
WOW!😮
I'm still in the Hadean period but I'm digging this, especially the music.
Kurz always make this stuff interesting
Just Woah.
45:00 I want to give that algae a high five
Wow.. unbelievable ❤❤
The music starts getting a little heavy around 20:00.
wow!
We finally got Kurzgesagt: The Movie, and I am here for it
This is wonderful. Thank you.
This really is something else guys! What a masterpiece. Congratulations ❤
Not me watching this masterpiece 1 hour straight
Bill Wurtz just got dethroned.
*triggered creationists have entered the chat*
1 hr  nice try kurzgesagt but im sleeping early tonight
neat
Yoo
Music is great. 26 minutes in and I’ve already drifted off to sleep for a minute or two.
Floor is lava 😂
hey we could make a religion out of this.
Hard to do my drawing job when my head is constantly bobing for 1 hour at some sick tune. Awesome video.
This is why i keep buying calendars and other merch.
At 19:40 I thought, is this where the Doom Music kicks in?
This is amazing, this channel is really amazing I am truly grateful for the hard work your team puts behind these videos and making them free for all
no offense to the narration, but is there an option for just the video and music combo?
The music you choose is so fitting. Do you have a playlist of all the songs you use in your vids?
Woooooo! One whole hour of hopeful existentialism!!!! 🎉
What
My god, this channel is crazy
0:50 Hadean 8:05 Eoarchean 13:20 Paleoarchean 18:35 Mesoarchean 23:50 Neoarchean 27:47 Siderian 30:25 Rhyacian 33:45 Orosirian 37:00 Statherian 39:37 Calymmian 42:16 Ectasian 44:53 Stenian 47:31 Tonian 51:12 Cryogenian 52:18 Ediacaran 53:35 Cambrian 54:18 Ordovician 54:50 Silurian 55:10 Devonian 55:55 Carboniferous 56:43 Permian 57:20 Triassic 58:02 Jurassic 58:46 Cretaceous 59:47 Paleogene 1:00:22 Neogene 1:00:37 Quaternary
This is one of the most ambitious videos i’ve seen, absolutely incredible
This must have taken FOREVER
You cant put in to words how absolutley insane this is
This really deserves to be the most viewed kurzgesagt vid in the future
19:57 every tool song
The fact that humans know all this is the most baffling thing.
1410th !!!
This is amazing 🤩 🔥
I would love to have this video only with the voice and no music so I could had my own music in the background
Honestly impressed you were able to do all this in 4.5 billion years
Amazing
Possibly the best hour I have ever spent on the internet
wasent expecting a one hour upload out of nowhere
When the animators want to know how 4.5 Billion years of work feel
Best 1 hour of my life. The amount of time put into this is mind boggling. The minute details, the dynamic changes, it was smooth transitions all around. Truly one of Kurzgesagt’s videos of all time.
Managed to finish it in 26 minutes.  Nice!
A movie!? I love it!❤
Why is this 4K and in 60fps… Dang all the effort really payed off!
Amazing❤ that is why I am a patreon worth every minute 🙏
I liked my own comment
When you got nothing to do on Veterans Day and they hit you with all of world history.
Props to you for animating 1 HOUR. That's just insane.
Oh yeah, I’m gonna feel an existential crisis today I can tell 😂
Yooo
We really appreciate your hardwork. Thanks for uploading such beautiful video❤
It’s absolutely mind-boggling to me that we can experience how our earth changed over history all for free
Wow this is phenomenal. Thank you kurzgestadt
So amazing and unexpected! Lots of praise to the animation team, but also to the music producers. Haven't seen much praise for them in the comments. But this basically 1 hour progressive multi-genre song definitely keeps things moving and compliments the animations! The guitars at 20 min were dope. :D   just all around: AWESOME!
we all are going to act like we sat trough every second of this
I’ve heard about the new educational game in vr..it’s quite sick!
thats not the kurzgesagt i once knew and loved, thats sad
You deserve a break after this one Steve.
I love you❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
are you planning a 24 hour version of this video?
This is amazing. Unbelievable video
Lot of fumes at early stage
Gotta show this to a creationist
12 years of History class and this taught me more in an hour
the fact that this is free is fucking crazy
Real OGs remember the Hadean.
if it was our past then, it will be our future to.
how. JUST, HOW DO YOU MAKE ANIMATIONS THIS SMOOTH
wurtzgesacht
1 hour of kurzgesagt is something I didn't know I needed, but it's great that it exists
Shout out to the camera man going back 4.5 billion years. Legend has it this is only 0.1% of his power.
We waited for a 11 minute video and we got a movie!
Well god damn thats a serious video to pop up on a Friday!
Can you make a 24h version?
Holocene is missing
Here before 100k
Just imagining the hundred plus million years of torrential rain to fill the oceans with all the water that must have been hanging out in the atmosphere in and of itself is mind blowing.
THE SOUND DESIGN IS OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!!! 0_0    0_0
Excuse me?
Quite relaxing
LIKE HPW MUCH WOULD IIT TAKE TO EDIT THIS 1 HOUR
The EARTH!!! Full movie!
The floor is lava...
im here to say 'hi' to the future generations
bro this must have taken years 1 hour of animating
I liberally squealed with joy. This feels like a gift seeing as I'm going through an upheaval in my life.  Thank you for taking an hours worth of a load off my shoulders Kurzgesagt ❤
I LOVE ITT!!!!!
There is no way that we got this for free, what the hell? Absolute chads over at Kurzgesagt.
The only thing I knew is that, as a Geology student, this video will be viewed A LOT when I'm doing some stuff next to it.
K daddy
Entire history of the world. But KURZGESAGT, but fr. Let's appreciate all of the hard work and bloody knuckles from the animators and researchers and whatever other role. The kurzgesagt channel has millions of subscribers. You deserve it i appreciate this so much and your channel we didn't deserve. But we NEEDED! I hope the team see's this because i really appreciate this. Your channel made me learn so much
I didn't think it would be possible to love Kurzgesagt more. I hope these keep getting made.
I clicked this video so fast, it was like insta no scope headshot
Only a billion years in, but its incredible
Was not expecting this when I opened YouTube today
This is the worst video u have made why all this time in which u don't speak
watching every ad so that y’all get all the love you guys deserve. Thank you for such an amazing video!
Everytime you skip 10 seconds over 12500 time humanity's existence is skipped
is there a commentary free version of this? I would love that!
Did not know that the best music was made during the Mesoarchean era. Huh.
It’s God create all of this
My next hour is set, hooray
Sliding through the Hadean as I'm writing this, hoping for appropriately informative levels of detail into our current understanding of the past with regards to life from the monocells all the way through the Cambrian explosion, maybe even vegetation as a concept; the first trees? So much to dabble into, so many observations.
Kurzgesagt must be 4.5 billion years old then if he knows all this. Mystery confirmed!
Liking it now, watch it later
1:00:43 Oh hi Mark!
Just imagine that we discover ancient aliens that shaped our future and past and you will need to redo the whole thing 😂.
4.5 billion years in one hour is roughly how long an episode of love island feels
I’ve been following kurzgesagt for so long now. From the beginning, and this is one of the most amazing videos to ever be released. You have taught me so much. How to see life as it is and how to appreciate for what it is. I really hope that you guys keep going for years to come. Truly you guys are my favorite creators. Absolutely fantastic and intriguing animation.
@7:20 "That it is still much hot and comfy" That doesn't make any sense.
at the moment no one has finished this
woah they had amazing bands back then, playing sick instruments over lava
Thank you all Kurzgesagstsggt
I didn't expect the music to go this hard for this video
The background music slaps.
No way, never thought I would ever spend an entire evening watching just a single kurzgesagt video. Awesome🎉🎉🎉🎉
1 hour is just too much for those animators
Now I’m waiting for Bill Nye to do this.
I dare kurzgesagt to do a video on whether gender is binary or non-binary
Thank you so much, I can’t imagine how long this took, especially considering the new music needed and your previous estimates of how long a video took
Genius video and just an incredible soundtrack alongside
Kurzgesagt really figured out how to make movies from infographics, something nobody asked for but everybody wanted.
This is 23 minutes ago for now is weird to me
Gotta love those gnarly space ingredients!
You should make a religion out of this.
I am afraid that if i blink i will miss 40 centurys
Alright, after the first 10 minutes I just skipped in 10 second intervals to see if there is something interesting in this video.   I have to say... this was an amazing waste of time. It's just a 10 minute video stretched out to an hour with the excuse to go a million years every second lmao.
2 minutes into the video i realized this was an hour long  WHAT
You guys never cease to amaze.  THE FLOOR IS LAVA.
People be getting happy while there isnt much in this video except time accelerating and camera sliding (no hate tho, its just not as exciting)
1 hour of Kurtzgesagt is something that I never thought I’d see. Thank you so much for this I can’t believe this stuff is free
Bill Wurtz did it better.    . (Jk, great job guys)
Yawn I can sum up all of history in one second……”FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
I could only understate how truly amazing this is the animation, music, and history.  Could we just have the hour but with just the animation and music with no commentary?
I love how fast the human era diddnt even last a second yet we already own earth
I wonder if someone who had lived all these years, would've been able to grasp the time span any better than we do. I don't think our brains are very good at that.
Obv i havent watched it yet but i rlly love the concept of this video and would LOVE to see the universe evolution, from the big bang to this day or maybe even to the end of it
19:30 🤟
wouldn’t it have been more logical for the video to use a logarithmic time scale, since we know way less about stuff that’s older than newer stuff?
The music is amazing
Welcome to the eras tour... The earth eras tour.
It's s crazy to think about how ancient earth is and how new we are. How in scale, the entirety of our history and life as a species only lasts almost 2 seconds out of an hour
HOLY FUCK
Here we go again ! :D
hi
We love you guys. Amazing.
This video will be used for generations ahead in schools and everywhere else!
A monument in animation, excellent work.
Omg this is the absolute BEST thing!!! I LOVE KURZGESAGT!
Everyone is talking about the 1 hour of animation, but major kudos to the 1 hour of sound design too!
Nerd Emoji: The Movie
1hour, 3minutes and 30 seconds*
I cant even begin to grasp the amount of work you all put into this. I have yet to finish it and im baffled. I love seeing you trying something so different.
I feel so spoilt rn
1:37 The one time the floor was actually lava, no one was around to play it :(
Make this top comment (social experiment)
"MASTERPIECE"
if a 15 minute video takes 2,000 hours to make (83 days) That means an hour long video took  332 days to make They must of started in January to make this video And it's FREE for us to watch
Kurzgesagt is the type of guy to make a 1 hour video of earths lore
Finally, the ULTIMATE research for my history class.
This feels illegal to even watch.
Lol I think the music is actually better at 2x speed. Really gets some metal-ness (at least where I'm at at 20:00)

Woah! Kurzgesagt, this is crazy!! Thank you so much!
How long did it take the animation team to make this?
59:46 uh oh..
This is incredible
This deserve both a like and comment ❤
*"Good video but you can't beat Vsauce in giving me existential crisis."* As always, thanks for reading
I would really appreciate a timestamp list of everything spoken.
BOYCOTT KURZGESAGT!!!
I saw this video and i was like "HOW AND WHEN HAVE I MISSED A ONE HOUR LONG VIDEO FROM KURZGESAGT-" and then I realised it was posted 20 minutes ago lol. Thank you for this video!
thank you for this truely amazing content, for free. you are a gem of a channel/team!
we will skip some filler content (human history)
I could never comprehend what millions of years meant, until i saw the galaxies on James Webb Space Telescope. The universe is ridiculous.
digging the music 🎵🎶
What kind of genre would you call the background music?
holy hell how long did this take
Ayo that some real dedication ✨
Eoarchean is literally just living along the english channel
this is sensational
This is such a cool and ingenious way to experience the history of our little blue dot. It's channels like yours that give me hope for a better future for everyone ❤
bro took speedrunning 100% to a whole new level 💀
I am SO EXCITED to watch thissssss!!! Gonna be a blast! One hour, thank you kurzgezagt!
Oh it is really 1 hour long😂
Kurzgesagt, you almost gave me a heart attack with that runtime.
Just started watching. Cool concept for a video :) Thank you once again to the good folks at Kurzgesagt!
The fact that the human era is less than one second in a 1 hour video is truly mind-boggling.
Could you release a version without any talking, this has some real potential, its very calm to listen to.  Still a great video.
DOPE!
Holy fuck, this is like -- feature length! Well done!
This is absolutely incredible. I bet you guys have been making this one for years!! Great job!!
This is really boring!  Cheers
The fact that this is free to watch for anybody is incredible. The man hours that must have gone into this are insane.
1 hour of animating must’ve taken years, the fact that we got this for free is insane
The animation is gorgeous, the music is soothing and matches every era it plays in. Beautiful work.
Damn 1 hr??? Thx to you for making me to like free knowledge for me to understand😊
Absolute kudos to yall mfs you actually made it an entire hour, holy shi
this is a entertaining, chill, cool and educational video keep up the good work Love the music too
O
1st billion years!
Kurzgesagt: terrible when it comes to politics, perfect with literally anything else
1 Hour of Kurzgesagt is something i would never expected bruhh, this is why you're the best and top tier 🔥🍷
I can already tell... this is gonna be a new favorite.
I wanna make this my wallpaper!!!
Very good video.... But i think youtube is putting the CC out of order... the rainy one of the eoarchean came before the last speech of the Last hadean....
This animation is history in the making.
my birthday is tomorrow. this is an early present lol
This is beautiful. This video completely captures why I love Kurzesagt. The art, the music, all inspiring me to learn about our amazing planet and species. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for creating such a masterpiece
This beat straight jorkin
BROOOO WHAT an hour vid? It's 12:30 and I'll stay up till 1:30 for this
Waiting for the train after work I found this video. I was looking forward to doing some drawing tonight, this will be perfect as a background video!! Thanks!
1 hour is quite insane lol
This is amazing, I can't imagine the time and effort that went into this. I would recommend using this as background for studying as background music.
at the time i wrote this comment, nobody has finished this video yet
Thanks for the brave crew cameramen of Kurzgesagt who spent 4.5 billion years of filming for us and then conveniently editing it to 1 hour so we can afford to watch
1 hour? WOOOOOOOO
The effort put into this forces me to watch all of it
HOW IS THIS FREE?!?
29:43 they are forced to use adobe products on daily basis
you're rivalling disney at this point. In German we'd say "Was zum Henker?!"
Is that timer at the top right supposed to say Million or Billion? I’m confused
This is absolutely incredible
This feels like an evolution of the time and time remastered videos! Both of those are my favorite videos on this channel to date!
OMG 1 hour! What a treat. This should have been released on Netflix or something
1 whole hour, time to get some popcorn and doubt my existence.
I don't think anyone would've complained if you titled this video "The Earth's History in a Nutshell, I Guess".
There are very few channels with this large an audience that can pull off hour long videos.
❤❤❤
So cool
I've been a fan of this channel since childhood and it's probably the biggest single factor in spurring my lifelong curiosity about all the big questions we face. Y'all have certainly accomplished your goal of making learning into something that people actually want to do for fun, and I have no doubt it will translate (and already has) to a profound positive impact in the world. Thanks for all you do
I love the music! What is it?
Wow when you realise the little red bar is just for the hadean period
What an amazing video. Well done. Still watching and will watch at least once.
Dude. I have no words Props to Steve, Phillip and the entire team
Got to wait a hour I guess
I kinda wanna live forever and actually watch time pass this way.   Would be nuts and I'm all here for it.
What a time to be alive. For your information offer, I would have had to sit in the library countless hours. Danke Kurzgesagt❤
This is quite the interestign premise for a video
In 2x thats truly insane
0:00 Intro  0:51 Hadean (7 minutes 13 seconds) 8:04 Eoarchean (4 minutes 16 seconds) 13:20 Paleoarchean (5 minutes 15 seconds) 18:35 Mesoarchean (5 minutes 16 seconds) 23:51 Neoarchean (3 minutes 56 seconds) 27:47 Siderian (2 minutes 37 seconds) 30:24 Rhyacian (3 minutes 18 seconds) 33:42 Orosirian (3 minutes 16 seconds) 36:58 Statherian (2 minutes 40 seconds) 39:38 Calymmian (2 minutes 37 seconds) 42:15 Ectasian (2 minutes 37 seconds ) 44:52 Stenian (2 minutes 38 seconds (huh...)) 47:30 Tonian (3 minutes 42 seconds) 51:12 Cryogenian (1 minute 6 seconds) 52:18 Ediacaran (1 minute 17 seconds) 53:35 Cambrian (42 seconds) 54:17 Ordovician (32 seconds) 54:49 Silurian (19 seconds) 55:08 Devonian (47 seconds) 55:55 Carboniferous (48 seconds) 56:43 Permian (38 seconds) 57:21 Triassic (41 seconds) 58:02 Jurassic (44 seconds) 58:46 Cretaceous (1 minute 2 seconds) 59:48 Paleogene (33 seconds) 1:00:21 Neogene (17 seconds) 1:00:38 Quaternary (7 seconds) 1:00:45 Ending  Times may be 1 or 2 seconds off.

Happy 10th!  This was both very relaxing and exciting (as MariTheNon said "bliss and existential dread") thank you!
29:40 and that is why you use file-systems that checksum not just metadata but the whole data.
im famous! ty btw kur
Finally a video like this that takes things nice and slow, 4.5 billion years of history may have some "boring billion"s now and then but I find it all fascinating :P
i had to rub my eyes to check if saw that clearly. "1 hour"?? 1 hour video from kurzgesagt and it's free? maybe I'm still in dream!
This has got to be one of the best videos ever! This is gonna be epic🔥
What a start into the weekend, WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE !!!!! 🥳🤯
This is not good. This is AWESOME
The score is on point!
1h Kurzgesagt video? This is like a Christmas and Birthday present in one... for 4.5 Billion years.
I love this just by the fact that it`s 1 hour long.
This is just amazing your style of animation makes everything exciting and fun even the first 10 minutes of this video where it is just lava
the music is so good
A 1 hour long Kurzgesagt video!? Christmas came early!!! 😂😂😂 This one has to be viewed on the big screen!
the longest video?
thanks for making this available for all.
This is main stream propaganda.. the earth is 6000 years old people! God told me and frank in the booza last Friday
Woah!  1 HOUR!!!! It's incredible! But thanks for the interesting video!
love the music vibes
I just can't imagine how much months of workfore has been put into this video.🤯🤯 SALUTE TO YOU!!
The amount of work they put in this Channel is as mindblowing as the contents of the videos
Yea man that past hour was Insane
I will finaly have something worthy to mention to my grand-children thanks to this channel.
The amount of afford kurzgesagt puts in their video is just unthinkable.
I was gonna do other stuff while watching this, but I feel too invested to look away from this
Excelent as background sound, am gonna watch it a couple of times only today
This channel is incredible, an hour of kurzegsagt is a gift from the cosmos.
lets go, another amazing kurzgesagt video! also how do you pronounce your name?
Wow, Christmas comes early this year
I've got the popcorn!
Bill Wurtz walked so Kurzgesagt could run. And Kurzgesagt outran light.
Longest video of kurzgesagt ever
Imma watch this on the TV this is CINEMATIC fr
Woooooooooooaaaaaaa
I'd just love a video about what creativity even is :D
This is amazing
This is amazing
The moon is an artificial satellite and wasn’t formed by a planetary collision with earth.  This video is no longer relevant based on that alone
Bill Wurtz must've paid a visit to Kurzgesagt...
They better teach us using Kurzgesagt in the future
So maybe this is a stupid question but how did the first rain begin? I know it began in clouds but as I understand it, clouds recycle water through evaporation and moisture in the air, and then dump it all out. But if there was no water on the earth when the first rain began, how did that happen?
I wish i still was in my middle school ³rd year. Enjoying on VHS this masterpiece
That's a lot of effort little ducks!!!
im watching this to fall asleep rn. the voice is kinda relaxing and the quality is insane
Wow
sdrtr
E
I needed something to watch while procrastinating on my school work. Thanks, Kurzgesagt.
Better than the Mormon temple endowment ceremony ✌️
An hour long video mannnn kudos to ur team mannn such amazing work
1:37 the floor is indeed lava
love the videos, keep up the obsolutly amzing work :)
Not just the sheer amount of animation, but the music is a bop too!! We need more hardworking people like them
I’m surprised no one has generously made a timestamp for us in the comments 😢😂😂
First notes: impressive how dense lava was that it bursted and took 3 million years to fall down 🤪
Life is so, so brief. We can only experience a short glimpse of our current era in this universe. Let's make it great.
This is crazy. MANY THANKS
My favorite part was when microglia came into existence
The efforts this may have took 🙏 well done guys well done
Bro repeated are retention spans with one video
Grabs popcorn
1:37  The floor is lava 😂😂
One hour of Kurzgesagt? Let me just go get some popcorn
nice
Elepsi warning 😂
YIPPEEE
O mdc para ver isso e One Piece, está ótimo para mim hoje...
My dreams came true, one hour of a video of u guys, amazzziiinnnggggg ❤❤❤❤❤❤
i love this
1 hour of Wallpaper time!😊 Plus free knowledge.. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
Getting something so mesmerising,thoughtful and educating for free is just awesome
an hour of kurzgesagt animation?? shut up and take my views!  edit: those beats tho 🙏
hm this is a long video :l
Props to the animators, looks amazing
I... I'm sorry, but a hour long video!? Ho-ly-crap
55:47 This is what I have been waiting for. The music is also very cool
How did they do this
I got so confused. I was like "new Kurzgesagt video great! 4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour wait... one hour? no way right?"
maaaaaan, 1hour of Kurzgesagt i am down for it!
A billion is such a large number when talking about years. And apparently the universe is 3x older than this. Insanity.
This is probably the most worked on and dedicated video Kurkgesagt ever made. And the video is one whole hour!
My dudes just made an hour long animation and didn’t even make any announcements or anything!
W
Alright lads
I'm watching this with my baby to show him where he came from <3  edit: It occurs to me that I should clarify that by "baby" I mean my pet snake.
I love analogies like this, please make more videos doing things like size & timescale comparisons!
One of the coolest projects I've ever seen on youtube. People can make some seriously cool stuff and this shows that. Seriously cool video.
*screams like a teenage K-pop fangirl*
Uau bem loco
respect for people who actually watched the full video
The sound track here sounds like something James Primate would make lol
This is absolutely insane. Amazing job, Kurzgesagt
I love this channel so much. Thank you for always keeping us entertained and educated.
Awesome!
Great video. Would be nice to have a version without the BG music.
Kurzgesagt movie, that is what I am living for!
I was having a horrible day till now and got notification for an hour long video by Kurzgesagt. Guys you really made my day brighter than a supernova blast.
what the actual... 1 hour???  How on earth! i mean yes thank you but like how?
so much respect for this man and his team, an whole hour of top notch animating must of took ages  and still lets us watch it for free that just wild
👍
"The floor is lava"                      -Kurzgesagt
Even though I'm a Christain, these videos are still very insteresting to watch, keep up the good work.
POV: your mother finds her friend white shopping: 0:19
I think i'll watch this over the next couple of weeks, bit by bit
How many vedios I have made this one timing was unpredictable my other me is very productive but this me is growing fast!
a musica de fundo e incrivel
Love it
1 whole hour of animating is actually insane, props to the whole team!!
crazy how the ceo of s*x is actually an algae
Incredible production quality. Never realized I subscribed for Youtube Premium when I subbed to Kurzgesagt!!!❤
This is the less "in a nutshell" video I've ever seen, yet I'd pay for another one, even if I didn't pay for this one.  Wonderful work. Thank you so, so much!
Thansk Kurzgesagt for making a one hour video
The beat drops 3:50
I love you more than myself kurzgesagt
Omg
Bravo....Bravo....To the entire team behind this...what a stunning job...thank you.
Early
This video is an hour long and was uploaded 11 minutes ago. There's 1,000 comments. Neat.
Babe wake up! Kurzesgagt just posted an hour long video of the entire history of the earth!
The smoke following the asteroids into the lava are really bizarre.
The fact that life as we know it starts nearly at the end of the video..
hell yaaaaa 1hour of fuun  🥰😘
thank you for your efforts
You guys are amazing. This is great!!!!!!
Props to the animators!
this is what ill listen to as background music when i do work
Are you joking, 1 hour of Kurzgesagt!Amazing!😍
I think I saw my birthday for a split second
Take your seat to enjoy this masterpiece 😎
Ambitious main title 😅 Let’s check this out
Holy crap, on hour of kurz!!!!
Ah yes, one video before sleep😅
I started to watch when the video was upload "6 minutes ago"...5k likes, 23k views already. 5 minutes into it and I'm thinking how F!"#$ awesome is the music, the vibe itself, animation, fx sounds, all while still working. Great to have you around all of Kurzgesagt team !
Shout out to our crazy cameraman, hats off.
Alle Lügen der letzten 2.000 Jahre in einer Stunde zusammengefasst - hervorragend.
1 hour of animation for free wtf 💀😭
.
fun fact: nobody has watched the entire video till now
Wait. Id that an Archaeopteryx on 59:02??
An hour long Kurzgesagt video? This is history right here.
This is relaxing and informative definitely gonna to watch this more then once
This could be transformed in a platform game with those birds jumping the lava and obstacles 😍😎
This is a dream come true. ❤🙏🏼
Fuck yea! Need more long Kurzgesagt videos.
Im watching this. Not in background. Fully. Im commited.
This is absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much.
what a grind, thanks kurzgesagt team
This is gonna be the greatest YouTube video I’ve ever seen
1 HOUR???? HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE
My favorite lofi
What a great moment to be alive
Now I know why they took 3 weeks to do another video 1 hour is insane!!
Holy shit a whole hour of the timescale of our planet for free.         Truly kurgezsagt is the gift that keeps giving.
Damn, a whole hour? With this quality? And for free? I can't imagine how much work this must've been, this is genuinely insane.
Incredible. Beautiful.  Best content on the internet
This is incredible!
Telling history in one hour X Making history by making Kurzgesagt video one hour long √
I never knew that there was ambient electro music playing 4.5 billion years ago.
Always loved the soundtracks of the videos, and now I have an whole hour of new songs to look forward to...great!
I know how I'll be spending my friday night. *Gets edibles*
this video is so mesmerizing i just can't stop staring at these animation
bill wurtz: pathetic
OMG imagine how much time was put in the making in this video it's insane 😮
so.... we dont matter. like, all of mankind, completely does NOT matter? relative to time and space, we are basically nothing? all of our human history is nothing? all those wars, all those reformers, all those religions, their all just these small little things that happened for about a few thousand years?   ...  damn
Is there a Kurzgesagt music album/record? There should be if there isn’t one.
Anyone able to play this video while YouTube is closed on mobile? I can only do this video for some reason
PLEASE STOP LYING TO PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. READ THE BEST HYSTORY BOOK ON EARTH, THE HOLY BIBLE. THE EARTH IS 6000 YEARS OLD. CUT THE CRAP ALREADY... AND TURN TO GOD AND REPENT!!!
Wow
That's just an absolute amount of hours put into this. We appreciate every minute of it thank you 🙏🏼
1:00:38 I blinked. missed all of human history
Wish YT had a real time playback speed option, 0.25 isn't slow enough.
This is probably your most ambitious project in terms of scale.
At this point they might as well make movies. I'm more excited for their 15minute videos than Marvel movies at this point.
All of theirstory! This is everyone's story. Human and non-human.
new experience
Finally an actual video that isn’t an advertisement
OH MY GOD ! An hour long Kurzgasagt  vid. YAHOO!!!!
I love these
If you guys need us to run a 1 hour long video in the background You can just ask I will do anything at this point Just give us more content 🤤🤤
Oh my god this is freaking amazing
This project must have been very long in the making.
I can't believe, THIS IS SO BEAUTIFULL
1 hour 😦😲 Great animation
This is wild and awesome. Random question, any chance of a commentary free version? Even if it's just posted unlisted? Could be an amazing background almost piece of art to have on with just the music.
Babe wake up kurzgesagt uploaded a new video
This has to be one of the most informative contents in the last 4.5 billion years.
Just brought me back to this channel after years
great
amazing video! using it to study for geography
Right on, Brother.
playing it on 2x to get the whole picture 😂
I was there for most if this and i gotta say, pretty accurate.
Claim your here in one hour GOLDEN TICKET 🎟🎫🎟🎫🎟🎫
Thank you! This is mesmerizing!
Hat's off to you I can't imagine you did 1 hour animation
Never have I been so early😳  Currently at work so this'll have to wait until I get off to sit and watch
9 minutes ago 23,219 views 883 comments 5.1K likes  Edit 2 minutes after: IT GOT 5.5K LIKES IN 2 MINUTES
u crazy for this one earth
I nominate this for the Oscars „best documentary“
It's REALLY IMPORTANT to emphasize that one second represents 1.5 MILLION years.
HOLY CRAP THEY MADE AN HOUR LONG ONE
Much hot. Indeed.
It's crazy to know that humans only existed for less than 0.5% of earth's history.
I just know the music producer for this video had fun. I love it
Props to the cameraman for witnessing all of our earth’s history and recording it for us ❤
Can we appreciate on how long this Kurzgrsagt video is! ❤
Saying "The floor is lava" instead of "earth surface is covered in lava". I think that's on purpose:p
"you can have this in the background, study with it or just enjoy the ride"  Meanwhile, me on my ass watching and paying attention to every single details
Nice work
This is the greatest thing uploaded to YouTube
WTF KURZGESAGT ARE YOU OK? THIS IS WAY TOO LONG 😂
When I saw the 1hr runtime on this video I really thought it was gonna be some compilation of old videos or something
What the fukc do you mean a year 😍😍
The best channel on youtube. Seriously, no one puts in soo much effort to make a 1 hour long video just to post it for free. Like, im speechless, impressed, amazed and astonished considering the effort it took you guys, and you guys didn't even take a break to make this video, you posted other videos in the mean time too. Hats off to you and your team.❤❤
:kgsEpic:
Holy crap. Time to get out the popcorn bois, we've been blessed by the Kurzgesagt Gods! 🙏🙏
Wow this is insane, how was this planned?
wow
Just finished it, insane video 👌
Kurzgesagt, you're literally just so cool❤
a friendly reminder: God created it all. great video btw :)
One hour of Kurzgesagt sign me up 😊
Wait, really? Early Christmas present from Kurzgesagt?
"You can have this in the background, study with it or just enjoy the ride". Well you got me good this time. Don't mind if I do!
You guys should be able to partner with robot attack unicorn and adult swim
amazing sadly my shitty internet randomly stops this masterpiece
It’s a violation to have this for free, Kurzesagt should make some exclusive videos to boost revenue therefore you can make better videos in the future! These the most high quality for free in 1 hour, Like thanks to all the animators and workers for making this shi free.
Thanks for sharing those knowledge with such a great animation!!
Love to everyone currently watching and also lucky enough to be born at the same time as the Kurzgesagt team ❤
It’s crazy to think that the rock we live on has existed for nearly 1/3 of the universe’s existence.
1 hour😮😮
This video really gives a sens of scale of the incredible journey of Earth
Nah I’d win
we all have to agree that kurzgesagt spends a lot of effort to make one of the best videos on this platform.
818🎉th
incredible video.
Imagine opening a CD bank account on some interstellar world back then how much would you have today❤
This one-hour journey is going to be the highlight of my week. Thank you, Kurzgesagt, for this incredible video!
Kurzgesagt thanks for everything you’ve done for us and giving all of these educations for free last year I used three or four of your immune system videos to make a presentation for biology and I used your animations, of course I credited you in the end and all of those was done by the help of yours, my teacher was amazed, every student that did a presentation she said good job but for mine she said you made a beautiful presentation, she said it so much that I was like Isn’t she saying it a bit too much, it was obvious that she was amazed and I couldn’t have done that at all without this channel thx so much and this year I’m using your climate change vids for geology and cancer vids for biology thanks for everything you guys are the best, when a video releases I’m like it’s time to watch! You guys are the best with the best animators and smart people! Go Kurzgesagt!❤❤❤
Not quite so kurz on this one 😂
Can we have an ambiance version please. The music ruins it for me
NOOOO WAYY 😆
This is probably one of my favorite videos I have ever watched!

Props To Everyone Involved In Making Of This Video. This Should Be A Real Theatrical Documentary Movie!

I can't imagine how long this must have taken to animate. As an animator myself, everything is so impressive!
Oooooohhhhhhweeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This must’ve taken years, probably near half a decade, of work. Hats off to Kurzgesgagt! ❤🇲🇹
I LOVE YOUR VIDS!!! There so interesting! Hope you guys are doing well! ❤❤❤
This looks so cool
I’m sure this is going to be amazing!! ❤🎉
The amount of time it would have taken to produce an hour video is unimaginable...
Holy smokes whole hour of this 0_0  Seems like it was worth subscribing after all :D
Yes
Ahh yes, finally, 1hour kurzgesagt video
789th
This is incredible
Finally... Langgesagt.
This is a really cool idea ❤ maybe you could do a full universe timeline in this format
This will actually be great to idle play during a lab assignment for my class. Stoked for this.
Please do it agane with the universe
its so visual
This probably take year since the first sence have a different style compared to how it is now
You know today's a good day when there's a new kurzgesagt video.
I love the idea of this
Really creative idea to convey how old our home really is. Thanks! ❤
I'm really vibing with this
imagine kurzgesagt channels birthday is the same as me but 5 years later lol
Can’t wait to get home tonight and watch this in bed
Worked on this since… 2019… holy
People commenting rn havent even finished the video. Lezgo 1 hour of Kurzgesagt
Thank you so much kurzgesagt for making this free. No other channels put this much efforts.  ❤ from India
The day just got a whole lot better
wtf 1 hour animation?! The quality of this channel is H U G E!
the animation and coloring in this video is spectacular. as an artist i cant even comprehend animating an hour long video... excellent work! ❤️
The time and effort you put into these videos is always appreciated. An hour of incredibly well made content is something that deserves every like and view it gets. Keep making these great videos, they never fail to be interesting and informative.
wow an hour-long video by Kurzgesagt! count me in
44:59 so that's where the horny started...
How quickly did the moon lock tidally with the Earth?
*You absolute legends! I feel greedy for saying this but... I wouldn't have minded the 5 hr and 15 min version, where the very last second of the vid encapsulates the entirety of Human History.* 😂🤯🍿❤️
Lofi Kurzgesagt radio - images to relax and feel existential insignificance to
You're truly the gem of YouTube, outdoing yourself everytime. I'm proud of being a witness to your journey.
Last
How did scientists even discover all this? It seems surreal being able to tell the past to this detail.
holy shit an hour long kurzgesagt video! we eating good tonight boys!
Should I watch this at 2x speed?😂
Great animation like always!
What did just you do? ITS AMAZING!!
A 1 hour kurzgesagt video, to say Christmas came early is an understatement, it's like 100 Christmasses came at once, thank you kurzgesagt!
How long did this take to render?
Oh this is just an ad for an album keep it up guys include description skips
Wow❤❤❤ this is incredible
You should do one of these for the beginning of the universe, altho idk how much time would have to pass per second to make it an hour long tho
A free movie to watch, Thank you Kurzgesagt <3
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Need name of this first relaxing track 👀❤ツ
This is insane
1 hour of animation? This is insane.
An hour long videoo from Kurzgesagt letss goooooo🎉
1 hr video of kurzgesagt.. i know for sure it will be good
Kurzgesagt is no longer in a nutshell
thanks to the cameraman for travelling back to 4.5 billion years
before 1000 club
Sound so good😙✨
Bro this is Netflix material ....
The amount of effort went here is tremendous. And the soundtrack! Really good! Makes me really feel small
W
got here fast
Lmao, ive always wanted a movie like this! done in Life like CGI, but god damn well done!!!!
4 mins since release and 1 hour video so nobody has fully watched this video yet. Save this in time capsule.
Woooo!
we making it outta earth with this one
This is a genius video idea, perfect to run in the background while doing something else and still learn from it👍🏼
F is 4.5 billion years old. WHAT ABOUT e or g?????
This must have taken years to make , realy appreciate for making it free 🐦.
Sophist propaganda, earth is only 7000 years old.
It’ll be a lie if someone said they finished watching this right now within a minute
1:33  Aah yes , i remember the floor being lava . Such a good trend it was
I'm only a few minutes in, and I can already tell this video is a masterpiece.
I put this on for some background noise while I work on stuff and my god, the music goes so hard for working and im only at minute 5 so far
Amazing work !
1 hour of Kurzgesagt? Easily the best thing in 12023 so far! Much love to everyone involved!
incredible, I can't believe you dedicated 4.5 billion years of your lives  making a 1 hour video, that's true dedication
This is my fourth comment but this dude is really good
OMG! 🥳
‎
This channel is actually way more fun the history class
Oh this is to say a planets surface become life sustaining earlier than previously theorized
I just wanted to take a quick break and watch your new video, but ONE HOUR I haven't even started but I already know it's awesome. You're incredible
WHAT
This is epic.
This is really neat.
Wow sound like a great videos i'm impatient to watch everything
THIS IS A WHOLE ASS MOVIE LETS GOOOOO
An hour of Kurzgesagt?! This is the best day of the year!
watching this for free is insane
I love it
Heaven has arirved
wallpaper of this will be lit
Its hard to imagine even 4.5 bilion years in 6000 years, not to mention in an hour
Ayo
Me: *sits on Santa's knee*  Santa: What would you like this year, little one?  Me: Long form Kurzgesagt ❤  Santa: Hold my beer.
i thought i was seeing things when i saw one hour video from kurzgesagt on my recommended
I love you and this channel but this vídeo will never get close to the "History of Everything, I guess" by Bill Wurtz 😅
Wow! Most ambitious video yet. I was here when it dropped!
An HOUR long video?!!
I was wondering why Epic Mountain add a new massive Kurzgesagt original soundtrack a few day ago. Now I know why ! And even if I didn't watch it entirely you get an instant blue 👍.  Just a thing the music is already a certified hood classic for me as always.
This video is so entertaining to yank you for making it!
thank you kurzgesagt
굿
NGL the music in this video is amazing.
ay
Getting some epic "Cosmos" vibes and I'm loving it
Why did the moon fly away from earth after hitting it and then stop at a dustance to orbit? Wouldn't orbit have kept it right next to us immediately? Did it just bounce off liquid lava with such force it went back into space?
This kind of video should gonna watch by kids nowadays not tiktok dance.
You gave me another video to binge watch.
OH MY GOD KURZGESAGT MADE A MOVIE?! IM GONNA HAVE SO SO MUCH FUN WATCHING THIS
Cool vid
Macht zuerst die deutsche Variante
Great video now do the same thing but for the future history of the universe
Omg! 60 minutes of great animation. Let's Go
This is langegesagt.
Best information channel on social media for posting 💪
One of the best YT channels ever
This so amazing, I absolutely love this and the work you are doing!
Oh wow, a whole hour 😮 Thank you for this!
what an incredible video
SAVE THE BURBS
Leave it to Kurzgesagt to make a 1 hour animation about the whole of the earth❤ The effort is unreal
Never thought I'd ever see an hour long video from Kurzgesagt! Now I see what you've been working on for so long.
This dude is the best YouTubeer
I want to watch it, but there videos are so damn good that when I eventually rewatchi it, it's not ganne be the same way as the first time. To see or not to see, here is the question.
OMG kruzsegat is not in a nutshell
It's a blessing to find 4.5 billion years summarized into a 1 hour video 58 seconds after release.
Skipping 10 seconds means Skipping 10 Million years..... Think about that Don't waste their effort
Whoever was involved in making this 1 hour animated video deserves a raise
You guys just made my day
Am I in heaven? I do not believe that in the mortal world I can come home to see a 1 hour long pre-history kurzgesagt video on my home page
I've been waiting for a new video man, mind saying the reason for the delay?
this is actually the greatest thing ever
aeugh
Watch at 2x speed so the video becomes "4.5 Billion Years in 30 Minutes"
THANKS KURZGESAGT
Did not expect this!
dang one hour is crazy
bill wurtz: "Is that the best you could do?"
Nice Timelapse, really does make a good background when working!
I'm gonna watch this after work today. So excited, probably the longest Kurzgesagt video ever.
Awesome job everyone! Super cool and interesting to my brain!!! ❤
Thank you Kurzgesagt, i am a medical student and you helped me understand the immune system a lot! <3
OH BOY!
I need a popcorn for this video
Jeez 1 hour
An amazing informative video. You really outdid yourself, Kurzgesagt
was here
That one time the floor is actually lava 😂
Nice new vid
Jesus
Damn, the effort into this episode 😮
Atleast the planet gets an amazing outro video
T It is different in a good way
This dude always helps me with school work, thank you
Holy shit

The animation looks SO COOL  You've worked so hard kurzgesagt team! Good job!
I would never expect a 1 hour video on this channel. Amazing!
I swear it would be the most awesome video of kurzgsagt
a Goddamn _HOUR?_
Just watched the entire video! Great vid!!
Oh my goodness. Kurzgesagt. You earned my respect. Hats off to you and your team. I know it took a lot of effort and you literally posted it free for everyone to watch, im speechless, really you guys are the best. I hope all the good things come your way. ❤❤
How many man hours did this take to create? My guess is around 2000, but could be more could be less...  Edit: After seeing a lot of loops maybe 1k?
Earth is actually 6000 years old, but cool animation!
... by accident.
This is amazing :DDD
True art right here...
This is the one
I ❤ kurgesrect :)
Now we need a video on how to pronounce "Kurzgesagt"
Last time I was this early the Cambrian explosion happened
Seriously? This Is Nuts Man!
Marvelous idea! Thank you!

Hello
Compressing 4.5 billion years into an hour is amazing, imagine just how long this took to make.
Can we just all appreciate the quality of these videos, they never fail to amaze me! I’d never miss a Kurzgesagt Upload!
Uploaded just 134 billion years ago
Thanks for the mini movie or documentary
Insane
"HOW DID THIS HAPPEN"

JESUS CHRIST ITS AN HOUR LONG! :o
the video i didn't know i needed.
This is the greatest Lofi every
I aint watchin allat
My god..... What a feast we have lmao
The history of the entire world, i guess, but longer.
My favourite part is where the sun is a deadly laser
I can’t believe these mad lads made this
I'm at the very beginning of this video and I just had to comment already. This might be the most amazing video this channel has ever done, and I think everybody should support them in the hard work they do and the dedication they put in together the information and animate every bit of this. It's just phenomenal.
53:26 epic
so is there no God?
Oh boy
1 hour kurzgesagt video, fortnite og, the boys new season, gta 6 teaser. all in one week. man ,life is crazy
I just got it
Kurzgesagt, you never disappoint with the amazing animation, narration and of course, information!
A 1 hour long Kurzgesagt video was not on my bingo card today. Amazing.
It was really one hour and three minutes
I've got a great idea for the next video of this kind: 4.5 billion years in 4.5 billion years :p
I can already tell this is going to be incredible
I somehow saw the title as 4.5 billion people wiped out in 1 hour💀💀💀
Longest Kurzgesagt video ever. Lmao
this is easily getting 100 million views
Definitely saving it for later
This one needs to go in the “Our best stuff” playlist
A very long video for kurzggesagt? That's great!!!
1 hr of animation?  maybe start doing PIXAR films.
Uau estou vendo isso mesmo! ❤❤ 1 hora de animação no YouTube de graça! 😮 Não tem como agradecer pelo trabalho que vocês fazem!
Bro  said “The floor is lava!”
i expected many things when i opened youtube but an hour of kurzgesagt was not one of them
I've never been so early to a kurzgesagt video. Guess the next hour spent will be about this
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE EARTH WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
10 YEARS ALREADY!!? man

Ooh, a Kurzgesagt podcast?
