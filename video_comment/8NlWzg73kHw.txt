So well put together.
I like to try Gun Rave, and Ninja Gaiden 4.  Is it rumored that Dead Or Alive 7 will be coming out someday?
No timestamps in the description... Nobody bothered to make timestamps in the comments... Wow, must have been a weak show lmao
Also, Bruce Lee in Hitman?! That is so cool!😎
Dear sweet lord! I didin't expect to see Phill! I may get the games,but no game pass!😡
No broadcast for the Gamescom Asia in Bangkok? 😭
Naaaaa
Such a cool idea.
❤❤❤
I feel relaxed after watching this.
You never disappoint.
Os estrategistas do Xbox carecem de raciocínio lógico. Já se passaram 10 anos de Game Pass e ainda não se tem os planos devidamente organizados isoladamente focado apenas no próprio catálogo por forma de acesso. Imagine um plano simples de cada serviço isoladamente, sem venda casada. Um plano só pra Xcloud para usufruir do catálogo Game Pass nos navegadores e Apps Xbox. Imagine um plano só para instalar os jogos nos consoles Xbox (a base razão da marca Xbox existir desde 15 de novembro de 2001). Imagine outro plano de acesso ao catálogo só para instalar os jogos no PC. O multiplayer no Console jamais deveria ser pago, assim como já ocorre no PC. É na gamepley online com a comunidade que falamos de novos jogs e assinaturas e ficamos estimulados a comprar novos jogos.  Imagine que, se alguém desejar combinar planos, basta assiná-los separadamente. Os descontos na loja Xbox serem proporcionais as assinaturas ativas. Quem tem Xcloud+Xbox+PC ter 50% de desconto no jogo. Quem tem o plano apenas para PC, ou só para console, ou só para Xcloud, ter 25% de desconto na compra dos jogos na loja. Quem tem duas assinaturas, por exemplo, Xcloud e Xbox, ter 33%, de desconto na compra dos jogos e apps. Não deveria existir Day One no Game pass, mas sim os descontos no lançamento do jogo frente a concorrência, proporcionalmente a assinatura. Essas coisas que mencionei são óbvias e garante saúde financeira para ao projeto e atrativo para os clientes atuais e novos. Uma relação ganha ganha. Não se pode deixar de ter o espírito competitivo, manter a disputa por território, isso foi perdido. Jgaram a toalha ao não fazerem as atitudes certas. Vendam o mesmo jogo para a concorrência, porém, para os cativos assinantes, que este jogos estejam com descontos provocativos, a ponto de causar inveja para quem está de fora, instigando a sensação de perda de oportunidade e dinheiro ao ficarem de fora de alguma assinatura ou do console xbox.
Well, looks like Xbox has become a Spulless Shill. And I also cant believe how TONE DEAF Phil Spencer is, as he killed the Dev Studio behind Hi-Fi Rush, while alao butt fucking Xbox Fans with jacking up Xbox Gamepass Prices.
Greed is a deadly sin
We want a chicken escape game like the one that was on PS1, realistic, and a Donald Duck game like the one that was on PS1
The cheapest one has a storage capacity of 2 terabytes, 32 GB of RAM, and a battery that lasts more than ten hours in 2025
Xbox Game Pass customer saying: Don't buy Xbox or Game Pass, it's not worth it anymore
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful To the esteemed Xbox Company,  I would like to express my appreciation for the period I spent using your services and devices, as the experience was remarkable in the beginning. However, in recent times, I have noticed several negative factors that have influenced my decision — most notably, the significant increase in prices, both for subscriptions and games, as well as a noticeable decline in service quality and the limited offers compared to other competing companies.  Therefore, I kindly request the cancellation of my subscription with Xbox permanently, and I would like to inform you that I have decided to switch to PlayStation 5, as it offers more competitive prices and a more stable and diverse gaming experience.  I wish you all the best and hope that you will work on improving your services and pricing policies in the future to regain customer satisfaction.
Meu dinheiro com Gamepass vocês NUNCA MAIS TERÃO   My money with Gamepass you will NEVER HAVE AGAIN
Olá, equipe Microsoft,  Venho expressar minha total insatisfação com a decisão recente em relação ao Game Pass. Não sou apenas eu, mas muitos jogadores que sempre amaram e apoiaram o serviço estão indignados com essa mudança.  O Game Pass sempre foi um dos maiores diferenciais da Microsoft, trazendo acessibilidade e fidelizando jogadores ao redor do mundo. Mas, com esses novos valores absurdos e essa decisão completamente fora da realidade do público, o sentimento geral é de revolta e decepção.  Podem até tentar derrubar servidores ou dificultar o processo de cancelamento, mas isso não vai impedir um cancelamento em massa. Muitos de nós simplesmente não vamos aceitar esses preços e não vamos pagar por algo que se tornou inviável.  Enquanto a Microsoft perde a confiança da comunidade, outras plataformas vão ganhar espaço — e isso poderia ter sido evitado se houvesse respeito e consideração por aqueles que sempre apoiaram o serviço.  Esperamos que essa decisão seja revista, porque a insatisfação já é enorme e a tendência é só piorar.  Atenciosamente, Guilherme Herrera
Online free please 🤬🤬🤬
Bring Avatar and Biomutant to Game Pass, $30 is ok!
Agora o PS5 e melhor que Xbox kkkkklkk
we need e3. gaming is losing interest because they decided they werent interested in generating interest. why am i watching a tokyo game show a week later? wake up microsoft.   lookin good Phil!!
500k views and no likes I wonder why rip game pass the only reason people used xbox
Olá Xbox! Olá Phill Spencer!🎉 Sou brasileiro 🇧🇷 Fã do Xbox, do seu trabalho Phill, e de todo time Xbox.  Vi o aumento de preços, e vocês estão certos.  O catálogo está cheio de jogos de peso, superproduções enormes, e eu vejo do outro lado a Nintendo e a Sony num ritmo bem menor, praticando preços mais altos, e focando mais na venda do hardware em si, com pouco conteúdo.  Jogo há mais de 30 anos.  Já passei por praticamente todos os aparelhos e agora estou no series S.  Tive uma ideia refletindo aqui, e gostaria de dividir com vocês!  Porque vocês não criam um serviço de Xbox semelhante ao que vemos nos contratos de Antena de Internet, estilo Starlink?  Onde o indivíduo contrata o Serviço por um valor X, e já recebe o Hardware?  Independentemente se o aparelho é novo ou não. Foi remanufaturado ou não.  E a base instalada seria o número de contratações.  Cabendo a Microsoft a distribuição e circulação dos aparelhos.  No mesmo esquema de contratos de prestação de serviços.  Estive pensando nisso, seria algo revolucionário!!! 🎉 E seria algo possível, uma outra opção de serviço que não exclui as vendas de varejo. Para vocês ter uma ideia, eu estou pagando o parcelamento do Xbox series S + a assinatura, está ótimo, de verdade, mas seria o máximo se existisse algo assim.  Por exemplo, você poderia assinar o gamepass e receber um series S por um valor.  E você poderia assinar um plano melhor Series X com gamepass.  Quando vcs lançarem o Xbox portátil, poderia ser Gamepass mobile.  Enfim,  acho que vocês captaram a sugestão.  Isso seria revolucionário, ecologicamente sustentável, daria uma rotação enorme, mas precisaria de toda uma estrutura semelhante a estrutura das empresas de Antena, satélites, com os postos de coleta, distribuição, enfim.  Mas vcs conseguem, vocês são a Microsoft 😉
I'm switching to PS your game pass is on real now too expensive
$30 game pass hell yeah
Phil, Sarah, it's time for you to leave.
MFS and Forza, 007, the rest are meh
wont buy the series x when my xbox one is gone i am too f xbox
I really hate Xbox brand now
E o preço do gamepass? enlouqueceram?
This was better than Netflix today.
The pacing was perfect.
With respect, but I don't know how Satyan Nadella can sleep, how to sink a brand.
I write from pain. A Playstation is in no way an Xbox, it will be for the brokers, not for me.
Their mouths didn't move in that Bruce Lee game! Talk about low budget...
Criticism of Xbox: Guys, I think they should release exclusives like before and not make games for the competition. That would improve sales of Xbox consoles and beat Playstation. I just hope they understand and that Xbox goes back to doing what it did before.
That's cool too know. 😎 Thanks.
just be honest, trumps buillshit is killing all our connections around the world.
Eh, could have done without gungrave. Got bored of that game about 23 years ago.
Forza Horizon 6 is coming to my Playstation 5 👍. Xbox has no games for life.
4 big games for me FH6💯🔥MISTALL HUNTER💯🔥 EVILBAN💯🔥 & TERMINULL BRIGADE💯🔥 #2026WillBeCrazy
We want mire games exclu Xbox
STUUUPID AHHHHHHH he said FORZA Horizon 5 that came out in 2021…!!!! 6 is coming out
Please fire the cringy millennials that made fh5
Ninja Gaiden 4 plays more like part 3 than part 2.  So sad
Minasan konichiwa
Man, Playstation gonna be eating good! 😊
Xbox, your presence is ruining games coming out of japan. You are infesting their studios with activists and rotting what made Japanese games unique.
Where is *Brave Fencer Musashi* remake or remastered?
Captions at the *top* of the screen is revolutionary in itself 😅
Google needs to update their “Phil Spencer” images search. 😅 bro’s a different person. 😅
Whoever picked the camera height. Please have a talk with them line it up with the nose not the chin. Camera should have set it up an inch and a half higher.
Honestly, GunGrave Gore isn't that bad now. Iggymob's cleaned the experience up quite a lot since its launch and addressed the most glaring issues with the game. They even added Bunji as a free playable character, and Billy as DLC. It's now a solid third-person shooter/action game, and more in line with what GunGrave fans of old would expect.   But I'm all for a remake that aims to bring it to greater heights and make it the best game it can be. Rather than remaking games that are already good and don't need it, I prefer playing remakes of games that were very flawed at launch and didn't quite reach their full potential. This gives developers the opportunity to surpass the original and redeem it. We've seen this work out for Yooka-Replaylee and even Pac-Man World Re-Pac to a lesser degree (that game was already good, but now the improvements are night and day).   In GunGrave Gore's case, there's plenty they could've done with Bunji and Billy in the story, and even Quartz, so we'll see what this remake entails. I'm optimistic though, Iggymob clearly showed they found the fun with GunGrave's gameplay and could improve upon it, and they even addressed criticism within months of the game's launch, so the prospect of a fullblown remake is very promising.
Bof !
Wow , perfect ❤
49:31 bruh 😂
So bad
Tops Xbox Japan your welcome 🙏 😊
fuck yeah bruce lee !!!
land japan
BRAVO XBOX 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👉🏻💖👈🏻🌎📺📀💿🎮🕹
Mann is it dropping on the ps5 or not?
How many of these games are actually gonna happen Phil?
Xbox Play Everywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! nice.....................For Everyone!!!!!
I'm going to be BLASTING Running in the 90's playing Forza horizon 6
All so unoriginal
all shit game
Everytime they have a good showing with good new, they drop a bomb on us with layoffs, cancelations,  closures, and price increases.
0:15 "Miina-san Konnichi Wa. Xbox no Phil des!" 16:58 "Miina-san Konnichi Wa. Xbox no Sarah des!" 47:02 "Miina-san Konnichi Wa. Xbox no Matt-to des!"
Hyped for Gungrave! Looks so good!!
What a pile of Rubbish!!!!!!
black ops 7 im jahr 2035.was gibts jetzt!? Fliegende spieler?BULLSHIT kann ich jetzt schon sagen
Holy damn, there's so much good stuff coming! After just a few years of a miniature draught (even then there were a lot of good games coming out, though) we got a banger year 2025 and from the looks of it another banger year 2026
The show was a big L😡😡😡
I don't want to play, for example. from PC to Battlefield 2042 on Xbox
Hit man lats goooooooooo🎉🎉
yes xbox more JRPGS WE NEEEEEEED THAT 💖💖💖💖💖💖
17:52 Hey, you might want to Activate Windows, you know... THE OS YOU OWN
FATAL FRAME 2 REMAKE HERE WE COME!!
4:17 They make fun of gamers who don't want ideological ugliness, then they cry about their low sales.
Xbox allie time. Question be if it hold up for long hours of playtime in hand
🇫🇷ASOBO vous m’avez rendu fier aujourd’hui 🥹🇫🇷
hi
This show was pure 🗑️
No more fallout please 😅😅 just stop
Great show this year
24:53 unbeatable reference! that's pretty suave i cant lie.
Skimmed through the whole video. What a bunch of wasted resources. They should have spent the money that went into those "games" into fixing the homeless and poor problem.
The majority of this looks terrible.
That thing on his back would hinder his movement immensely, to the point of rendering him immobile. He would not be able to hold up his arms due to the strain on his shoulders.
🙅‍♀Gozaimashita  🤣🤣🤣🤣 👉Arigato gozaimasu 👈
Monster Hunter Stories on Xbox?? Hell yeah! Now I really don't need a Switch 2 yet. Haha
Fatal Frame character models are a bit...
17:52 Don't forget to Activate Windows on the Dog Alley!
one day i hope i can see sunset over drive 2
Great video thank you
Time stamp-kun! We need you 😫😫😭😭
Xbox 500gb eles pega 200gb sobra 300 Forza 321gb 😢
Hey Sarah thats funny coming from you about delivering on your promise  So my question is where is perfect dark  You did promise that  But its okay  I think what you really mean is you delivering in empty promises  Have a bad day for me
I will not be supporting the rapists behind Activision Blizzard
their japanese was cringe, please muricans do it right or don't
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮Activision Blizzard / modern Call of Duty🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
😎
Suda and Swery!!!!!!
Hey Phil thank you for doing such a bad job and disappointing up on perfect dark
0:15 lmao
Bangerz everywhere! Yessssss
Did Starsand Island have a FREAKIN CAPYBARA...or was that the equally awesome Paca?
just trash games, what happend to Xbox dude.
The rebirth of Xbox is here, the platform rebuild from the Xbox One 12 years ago and the Series is a proper successor to the Xbox 360. Keep plugging in to the international market and community Xbox. Keep it up Phil🎉🎉🎉
ONLY LOVE XBOX ❤❤❤
the cat was just the best thing about this stream <3
The cat was distracting when Phil was on stage 😅
nothing to eso? Fallout 5? lol.
GUNGRAVEEEEEEEEEEEE
L..
Говнище
Wasn't Gungrave GORE a total flop in both sales and reviews? I bought it and it was an extremely low budget mediocre game. I hope they do a lot better this time.
48:38 FH6
I love how most people are watching this for fh6. I mean, that’s why I’m here too.
likey likey
Can you image how great these showcases would be if Microsoft still made games instead of cancelling them and firing people? That would be rad!
Any news about Microprose/Razbam flight combat simulator, F-15E or Falcon 5.0?
Wild how a billion-dollar company cannot even use timestamps.
“Is a new Xbox console coming?”
Final Fantasy 7 Reunion?
$999 for the Xbox Ally X... Nooooo, thank you.
I hope there will be a part of Tokyo in Horizon 6. It's a must
Dear Phil Spencer! You are a true LEGEND of the gaming industry! Thank you so much for your hard work!!! Thank you so much for XBOX and for the game pass ! The coolest guy in the gaming industry!
I’m still not used to seeing skinny Phil Spencer lol
wait wait wait, rhythm doctor?
logo xbox kucing hitam mata hijau 😊👍
))
Xbox game graphics are the best IMO better than PS but I see why PS is taking the top spot they make games for nerds not serious gamers it annoys me that their triple A titles are little thank God for cross platform game entries Gun Gale Hitman and Evil Bane were the only games that caught my attention the rest are for nerds Assassins creed and their former arcade style games like surfs up and their exclusive vintage football entry helped them a lot to draw serious gamers like me I'm really disappointed in Xbox game studios and the creators they've aligned themselves with because I feel Xbox can become a luxurious game company things needs to change when their new Console entry has been released they need at least 10-15 Triple A game announcement project that should all have been released by 2035 they need to take their game making seriously like they used to😢
Came here for Persona 6, down voted when I say 6 next to fordza.
Xbox is on fire in 2025! Amazing games, incredible announcements, Xbox Play Anywhere, and Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion to all Gamepass subscribers! Xbox continues to impress me!  P.S. Forza Horizon 6 set in Japan! I'm so excited for it! 🔥🔥🔥
About time we got news on FH6. Looking forward to play it
Just in case you forgot or didn't notice. This too is an Xbox Play Anywhere title. I know we keep saying they all are, but just so you know. This one is too.
Burnout is better than forza and gran turismo combined
Still advertising age of mythology
Sad that the stream only gets good after the 30 min. mark, except cod get out of here  even though playstation has always had asian games in the palm of there hands
Where the heck is state of decay 3?
Listen team ninja since your in collaboration with platinum games for ninja gaiden please fund a way to bring Bayonetta 2 and 3 to come 5o playstation please .... demo soon for ninja 4
the abrupt switch to first person when attacking is dragon quest is sooo terrible and a truly baffling decision - it ruins the entire game for me
How is it a remake for 1 and 2 if its still 2d
Hotel Barcelona what trash
honestly xbox cooked with their showcases this year
Did Oda get the idea for bubble coating from Dragon Quest?
Agent Bruce lee what a joke come on hitman
XBOX IS DEAD.
They already showed mh stories at Capcom showcase
Whats with the cat
STOP WITH THE FATAL FRAME AND SILENT HILL THERE IS ALREADY RESIDENT
SUDAAAA!
Gemma chan deserves so much more than 007 for the talent she brings
Man, i've become so brainrotted that I just know the r34 guys are gonna have a field day with animo..... its truly jover.
3:00 Anyone else feel like the new 007 game is really Perfect Dark with the character swapped out?
Pathetic
0:16 Bro, this hurt
This could have been a tweet
Why is Xbox so gay now?
Couldve just started with forza 6 and this video wouldve been easily skippable.
FH6 LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO!!!!!
So still no price reveal for the XBOX Ally? It comes out in less than a month!
DQ3 got a physical release on Xbox... will they do the same for DQ1&2 ???
Can we get that black cat as an Xbox live background?
Why did they stop feeding Phil
COD is 🐕 💩
Still no gears update. I'm loosing my patience with xbox
Drifting should be a huge element, but for the love of God @Playgroundgames please give us casuals a solid drifting tutorial and preconfigured set ups so we can enjoy it!!!
drifting in fh6 will be even  more epic now!!
This made me buy a Ps5
Announcing Forza Horizon 6 while Fable (also by Playground Games) is clearly struggling is just wild to me
This video was very entertaining.
Half these games we seen already. Also no ES6? Pass
Can’t fek’n wait for FH6
Forza Horizon 6 ??? HELL YEAH
Still NOTHING on Fable? Wth guys.
Everyone here: yeeees Forza Horizon 6  Me: Aaaaw what a cute cat.
make fallout 76 fallout 1st FREE.
Gears of war e day when????
Holy fuck Phil great job losing all that weight!!!! 👏🏿 ty for everything!
31:44 omg something went wrong along the way when so many apps are needed to play video games.
man we doing remakes just for the sick of it now how about we focus on brand new installments instead? 20:00
Meanwhile retailers are removing Xbox products from shelves.  I bet on the wrong horse ..
Her eyebrows are talking...
🗑
Forza Forever
I miss halo news
I've enjoyed all of the upcoming games that you showed dude I love it ❤
Só ano que vem
Bro... FH6 in Japan. Hope the map is really good and we have some dope towns to race AND DRIFT ofc, cuz thats what I miss in this franchise. Btw as a Playstation guy since my childhood, the Xbox Game Pass is a fcking masterpiece, and it keeps getting better. Thanks for that Xbox.
Espectacular. Regreso a Xbox Machine
so glad forza 6 going to japan!
48:35 Forza 6 Teaser startup....!
Phil looks so healthy and in good shape! Great job brotha! Lets go Xbox!
For the future: ad English voicover on top of Japanese speaking developers. This would solve the problem of looking at games and reading subtitles at the same time. Sorry, really annoiyng to this day.
I hope this one is less corporate than 5, the Mexican government approval made the whole thing bland as heck
Look at you phil. Dropping that weight. Good on you bro. Please put jpop edm music in Forza 6.
Before they said Terminal Brigade,I thought it was the elevator lift from Honkai 3rd
8/10
i hope the cars on forza horizon 6 wont sound like crap. they made the Volkswagen vr6  drive and sound like crap.
AC in Japan, now Forza in Japan, with a bunch of other games joining the Japan trend too, and not to mention GTA 6 (Vice City 2.0)  Y'all that's all my gaming dreams ever coming true, I wish I could travel back in time to 12-year-old me and tell him coz he would absolutely FLIP HIS SHIT 😍🤩
Why didn’t High On Life 2 get shown?
Lets GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO thank you!!! stay awesome yall!
Ninja Gaiden 4, Dragon Quest, Forza 6, and Rhythm Doctor!
The game with the guy with the iron thing hanging from it looks so random and surreal. Where do they get these developers from?
No halo…
If u buy a PC u can play playstation exclusives + Xbox exclusives + PC games + tons of consoles through emulators  The ultimate machine
The cat was the most annoying part of the show
I must ask: Who has the EA store as their favorite online store?
Games “in Japan” informs me that these companies are in a desperate situation. Japan locale is the “smash glass only in an emergency” 😆 COD, Forza…
Xbox better
as a sony fan i will say xbox got the better line up, kudos to microsoft and fuck sonys current PR and production team.
Well they really want to become PS and do PS like games awesome. I dont understand P3 obsession with Japan i hope the money. I saw no Xbox games except for Forza. Xbox No longer the shooter box.
First game devil may cry)
Meh
Where is Fable???
But no news abt the ally x
The scary thing about the near-future city maps in Black Ops 7 is that they all look like Japan today in 2025!!!  Japan is on another level 👏👏
PlayStation state of play was better
NO MIZUSU-CHAN ... NO LIKE ...
the GOTY of XBOX ... LIES OF PHILL ...
FORZA HORIZON 6 HERE WE GOOO!!!! 💯💯💥💥❤‍🔥
Forza6 Goty
is all of this coming to gamepass or no? i was really upset to hear neither borderlands 4, battlefield 6 and a few others arent coming. its $30 per month for my ultimate subscription id love to see more AAA titles coming to gamepass
Get Trails first chapter on Xbox
L show, didn't have Persona 4 Revival
🤦‍♂
FINALLY, FORZA HORIZON 6!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Bruce Lee cameo missions look pretty cool, Except.....It doesn't look like Bruce Lee at-all !?!?  With the graphics tech that we have now-a-days, they should be able to make Bruce Lee look exactly as he did.....What happened !?!?
this was wack
And the price of ROG Xbox Ally X?
I know it might not be a fair comparison but I feel disappointed after watching most of the Nintendo Directs but these Xbox showcases are simply fantastic
Where is "Gears of War: E-Day"?
Thank you
Forza Horizon 6 in Japan, take my money!!!!!! Have wanted this for a long time. Been playing since Forza Horizon 1 and always have wanted both FH and NFS to have a game set in Japan. Finally it’s happening :) I have a feeling FH6 is gonna sell incredibly well because of it. Please let this be good 🙏
boooooo on cod fuck your movement system in Black ops
only good for me was Forza 6, the reswt mhhh very poor
Still no Gears update...
It's hard to describe in human language how much hate Phil Spencer deserves... I don't get how so incompetent people stay at the top of international corporations...
HOOOLY!
57:53 "We are excited to be bringing 18 new multiplayer maps to Black Ops 7" - Shows footage of ripped assets from Ashika Island... Looks like a lot of work went into that map guys, well done!
Kinda ironic that Microsoft close Tango Gameworks…but yeah can’t wait for FH6.
Gungrave baby
Double dragon I’m for it
Mid show but FH6 saved this
Xbox is dead
IS FH6 GONNA BE STORY BASED
SWEET!
Black Ops 7 didn't deserve a place in this
Xbox is number 1 ❤
Comments always bring out the attention seeking kids 😂
Too bad Bethesda hates America so much, maybe their Terrorist backing team will find Japan more suitable?
No Sweet Baby Inc detected 😆
Nice 💚
Ninja gaiden and forza is the only worthy games in this whole showcase
Yes, Ninja mode for NG4!!!!
7/10
only worth thing shown was the gungrave game. time to boot up my ps2.
FORZAAAAAAA Horizon 6 for PS5 pls!
Xbox cooked this and it came out of nowhere
NGL...Showing up to TGS 2025 with just a teaser, not even one car, for FH6 is Wild!!!! And a little cold IMO, but they know we all want it, they know will wait lol,  soooo, ill wait, and cant wait to see what the night time looks like driving around. Seriously think this will be are NFS Underground 3 we always wanted but never got 👍 👍 👍
😴
I wonder how many people were fired during the show
13:35 Show starts
He’s lost a bit of weight ain’t he
boring
Horizon 6 where the hell is fable playground??!
That's all? I'm really happy I switched to Playstation.
bf6 devs: *Destruction!* bo7 devs: omgosh Cat Cafe! uwu
That was a 🗑️ show case of games 😂 👎
Well I Hope Capcom fixes Monster Hunter Stories 1 for the Xbox. On PlayStation it still crashes and has not been properly patched. MHS 2 works well however…
Gears day , marvels blade , forza , fable , now . Please please please make a halo reboot it’s only time !
So Fallout 76 has 4 Japanese players…
Finally a game i can get my dad to play
None of these games are gonna draw attention outside of their niche demographic. These are not good games
Where is hyperfunk
Lol they show off one interesting game and it's the sixth racing game in a series. Xbox is dead
I'm liking nothing about Fatal Frame 2 Remake...they're bound by the past so they couldn't make a worthy remake
Great Show!!
Disappointed they didn’t show the resident evil 9 extended cut that was promised
I hope people in Forza 6 will behave like in fh1 and 2.  Explorers , amazing experience , no bullying.  And also that there will be an improved system of reporting for behaviour. More detailed one.
I wonder if you know How they live in Tokyo!!!!!!
The only good game was Forza horizon 😂😂 damn xbox ... yall giving us trash games AGAIN
ah yes COD still tone death lol
Waking up to new trailers and FH6 makes me happy :)
At the very end of a GREAT year already 3-4 showcases.... At the very end of the showcase, last few seconds of a "8/10" showcase?.... OH.. one more thing for ya'll... FORZA horizon 6........ 11/10.... ( joking it's not all about grades, Thank YOU).
WHAHAATTTTTTT.. FORZZA HORIZON 66... ALL THE  FUCKING THEY FUCKING LOSRES COOL LOSERS... all they sohwed was a RANDOM MOUNTAIN, JAPAN LICENSE PLATE.. ONE MOUNTAIN----- FORZA HORIZON 6.... THAT'S ALL THEY SHOWED----  fuckkk FUDDKK YEAHHHHSSSSSSSS...   FORZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...  JAPAN......... 2026!!!!!1 NO DELAY!!!!!  YESSSS.
It's about time ninja gaidens' combat is more polished.
Xbox is dead!!! Shitty event!!! Wolverine > All games shown here. Pretending to care about half a dozen Japanese people who don't care about Xbox.  All sales in Japan as of September 21st in Units Sold  PS5: 7,040,024 XBOX: 683,447  Almost 11x more than the Xbox garbage
Minasan Konichiwa, Xboxno Phildes
fh6!!!!
Can we get the B button fixed on remote play so that it doesn’t try to back out of the app and have to tap the screen to continue playing?
Bring back Perfect Dark.
WTF Fatal frame remake PS2 remenber 😮
State of decay 3 nunca?
Good show
boring show only good thing was forza 6
It's the end of the Xbox Console, there are no exclusives. Xbox is over
Forza horizon 6 oh yeah 🎉
Hearing some of these people talk (Microsoft higher ups) is so irritating. Butchering the Xbox brand, overspending on buying Developers then firing people even if they deliver (looking at you, Hi-Fi Rush), and raising prices on a console that isn't selling well? WTF is going on.
Am I the only one slightly bummed that I'll be driving on the left side again? LOL
FH6. You've done it boys... you actually did it. Forza in Japan. I will throw every dollar possible at this game
Finally a game dev shows high level play and how they intend for you to take on the challenge five stars team ninja
Xbox has so much potential
GUNGRAVE?????
Alright! Forza Horizon 6 will be in japan ?!? Awesome! Let’s go!!!
13:13
Where are the games?
So no pre order date for the ROG ally that comes out in 3 weeks? Good job Xbox.
Bring back Kiiler Instinct !! .... F**K !!!
Please game play Forza horizon 6 ❤🙏
So no word about Silent Hill 2 Remake?
I know I’m the only one that would be excited for mana collection. I was still hoping for a small announcement here. Oh well
I used to love xbox I even still have xone s my favorite but now with the price increase it seems like they're planning on ditching it all
Horizon 6 Horizon 6 Horizon 6😁😁 i have been wanting this for over 10 years. thank you
Forza ❤
Xbox need competent leadership. Matt Booty needs to go ASAP. They should be in a much better position with all the resources that they have 🤷‍♂
51:21 FU*K WOKE
Where ananta
Fatal Frame !! HELLLLL YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Not impressed very weak lineup the Wolverine game trailer came out yesterday in the world went crazy. None of these games at this game show have a chance.
PS5 Forza 🎉
We need a Dantes inferno sequel or remake!!!!!
Awesome
I think Xbox should make a dock for the Xbox ROG X so you can play it from your TV.
Sadly this is the Xbox event I found the least interesting for my taste, but Rhythm Doctor, Gungrave and of course Ninja Gaiden 4 + Forza Horizon 6 were awesome
love Forza Horizon and can't wait for the next one... but seriously MS, why are you killing your own market with the baffling increasing prices on 5 year old systems?  You're making a mockery of yourselves.  Bring the prices back down to the original pricing.  You're just making yourselves look as anti consumer as the rest .....
Forza Horizon 6 coulda been epic & revolutionary but then I remembered Forza doesnt have VR support even on PC or PS5 PSVR2. Pathetic, deal breaker. Any car game needs VR support to even be considered, its mandatory now, theres no going back.
That, master ninja from Gaiden 4 is insane!! 🔥💯💯
Forza Horizon has always been a flagship series for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of gameplay mechanics and environment, this time, they're going to break that barrier again, and I'm here for it!  I just can't want, this will be amazing.
Phil's japanese always cracks me up lol. Hell yeah to FH6 in Japan!
13:38 show starts here 15:16 Games start
Dear Team Ninja, FIND THE SOURCE CODE!
Black ops 7....a.k.a. advanced warfare 2 😠
The only game I care about is forza horizon 6, marvel wolverine & gta 6 coming 2026 glad I own both xbox series x & playstation 5.🥂😎
I liked Phil better when he was chunky!
Excited to see what they do with FH6. I really hope they bring some new ideas to the franchise though, FH5 didn't hold my attention nearly as much as the previous two entries.
lame
So to be clear yall gonna really show ps5 on yall xbox showcase but Sony still not showing xbox on multiplat games in theirs
Playground promising a 2026 launch for Forza Horizon 6, meanwhile they've dripfed us updates on Fable, potentially delaying it to 2027, at high risk of getting canned, yet they somehow have the time and resources to create a new Forza game. I'm pissed off now.
who gives a fuck about forza  more people should play rhythm doctor
Xbox sucks
Can they beat wolverine?
Please bring back the original Forza Horizon
How much for a Rogue Ally X…seriously?!?
Road to 1k subs, 95 left. Come on guys.
far TOO many releases with none of them being worth a flip.
LETS GO FH6, I really hope they go deep with the customization. The car culture is huge there. In fact that's where it all began
Bring forza Motorsport back
I was at work when this showcase was on live so I didin't saw it, but i'm watching Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 now and i'm excited for Gun Rave Core Blood Heat, 007 First Light what's a cool James Bond game made by Hitman devs, Double Dragon Revive, Aniimo, Monster Hunter Stories 3, Hotel Barcelona, Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D Remake, Project Evilbane, Ninja Gaiden 4 and Mistfall Hunter thank you for a great show Xbox & Tokyo Gameshow 2025! 🎉😮
I was only here for Forza horizon 6!
Meh! Extremely underwhelming.
forza 6 and gta 6 at the same time, I am gonna smash your boys, elhamdulillah
Only good thing was forza6 call of trash 🗑  needs to go
Ghostwire tokyo 2 when???
I am not gonna lie. Xbox Play Anywhere being pushed makes me SO HAPPY. I have an Ally and Xbox and PC. I could buy my game once and the progress will go with me everywhere i go! I LOVE THIS.
Can we please get Halo MCC on switch 2?
As someone who lives in Japan, can confirm Flight sim looks better than real life.
Ok Microsoft you have my money, can't wait to play FH6!!!
That bloody máster ninja footage was amazing. NinjaGaiden 4 is a day 1 buy !!
It’ drops on my birthday 🎉
😎😎😎💚💚💚
It’s a few games that’s cool. As a Microsoft game developer. I’ve seen more stuff you couldn’t believe
If Playground Games doesn't get Japanese artists like LiSA, Man With A Mission, and Aimer in the Forza Horizon 6 soundtrack, I'm gonna be mad. Like that would be a missed opportunity. Heck, maybe some of their songs from anime. Idk just give us some of their songs PLEASE!!!
.
Double Dragon FTW
we came here for fh6 didn't we
Borint and joke... Lot of trash games...😢
Bring back older titles in remakes like the Getaway with bank robber Mark Hammond and dc Frank Carter
Can't Wait! Let's go!!!!
24:08 How comes Nintendo ninja didnt sue that yet ?
Los usuarios de PlayStation deben haber estado pendientes de este evento, gracias a XBOX lo tendrán todo sin restricciones, de XBOX no puedo decir lo mismo.
So happy for gungrave!!!!
Damn, the Monster Hunter Story games are no longer Nintendo exclusives?
More like Mid_box 1 lol
1k fired just after the show  =P
Honestly Miles better than PlayStation State of Play IDC what anyone say
FORZA HORIZON 6 IS OFFICIAL. YEAH MAN TODAY IS A GREAT DAY
15:15 actual Starts
Forza horizon 6 gamePass Hype
FH6 yeassir
Looks good!
H6 🤘🏽
Can't believe I had to sit through this site to see a fh6 teaser 😂 Should have watched on demand
I'm only here for mina-san konichiwa philu-desu
Great show but where is wuthering waves and other new anime rpgs
That was so fucking underwhelming
*Sees Forza 6's location* Fine I guess I'll get another year of Gamepasss
Let's gooooooooo  XBOX I believe you
Pretty big nothing burger 👍
Great sudden strike
It was a pretty decent showcase (as far as this stupid "direct" format goes). At least they primarily focused on games that actually appeal to Japanese gamers, unlike Sony who somehow didn't even understand the assignment.
Full Xbox library on ally?
Forza Horizon 6, welcome 🫡
I love forza horizon
I hope Aniimo destroys Nintendo or gives them a wakeup call
Forza call of duty ninja wowwwwwwwwww
Still no price for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X... not sure what you guys are waiting for cause any price will be too high most likely. If you were confident in the prices and the machines you would have announce the price already. Just a weird situation and suddenly they only talk about the non x version. Also, goal post has moved again, now the focus is xbox play anywhere, gamepass taking a massive backseat. Very hard to follow you as a company. How can we trust that xbox play anywhere will last?
Holy damn. Ninja Gaiden 4 looks INSANE. Hard core!!
waiting for news about the next metal saga game from the metal max series
Great event indeed! Xbox is an absolute shining star in this videogame era …
Sleep.....uh....must ... watch... Zzzzzz
Well, that was very underwhelming.
Microsoft really trying to get Japan to love them so they can get all the anime games that a lot of us gamers love but have to get a PS5 to play 😂
FH6.....yeeeeeeeeessssss
Gun Grave, 007, Monster Hunter, Mistfall Hunter... ❤❤❤
Forza 6 🔥🔥🔥
Forza Horizon 6 : Hell yeah!
FORRZAAAA 6 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
give me FH6 RIGHT NOW !
That was a terrible showcase.
Stfu you whiners. Be GAMERS and not moronic console warriors. You clowns are annoying as F.
Need a new Banjo game bro please
we bout to have peter griffin skin in bo7 2 seasons after launch, skipping this year’s cod for battlefield 6
13:52 FULL OF SHIT AND LIES
It's clear that Microsoft is now a game publisher, not a developer. But is it really that bad?
Good morning video game showcasing
Ozempic?
1:01:45 - FH6 Reveal  My guess regarding FH6: In about 6 months will be the cherry tree bloom season in Japan - just like in the trailer. I'd say, that will be its release - late March/early April  Follows the previous other cycles of announcement/release 👍 (6months)
a bit of a nothing burger just like capcom
X X XBOOOOOOXXXX🔥🔥🔥🔥
More fantasy slop every game looks exactly the same Xbox has fallen off sad what happened to the creativity that Xbox used to be
It's so bad it's disgusting
His name is MATT BOOTY😭😭😭
Well the new Gungrave looks good… that’s about all they showed that was worth a damn 🤷🏻‍♂️ (aside from Fatal Frame; but we knew about that already)
Very tiedous. Not the that the games here were bad but many were already announced and already showed before. Considering that 95% of the games will be released elsewhere, I don't see the point and interest to get an Xbox now...
That 007 game seems like I’m just watch the whole gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube
Forza Horizon 6🎉🎉🎉🎉
Forza Japan, JDM cars...ok ok you got me!
23:27 Nintendo's nightmare
Thank god for FH6 my absolute favourite series of games, feels like it's been forever but hey I will be definitely pouring hours into it unlike the recent games that have been lack luster
Wow!! Phil looking fit!!
Please Koei Tecmo translate the Fatal Frame 2 remake into Spanish.
We love you Xbox💚💚💚
Skip to 13:40 for show start
Horizon reveal - was amazing
19:07 not for two players simultaneous, i pass
Way better than the PS show
🥳🥳🥳👍
Sara bond is the reason why xbox i falling apart, can u get real non woke CEO?
woke shit, rip charlie kirk
Xbox price increases again time to stop giving them money who the hell would pay $650 for an Xbox and $800 for 2 tb series x 😂
Amazing retro synthwave song!!❤❤❤
Only that 😢
Japan is overrated, they should start making games in Azerbaijan
Nothing to buy here!
Mortal kombat vs killer instinct  !!
Me: thinking about ghostwire Tokyo 2
incredible how barren of original games xbox keeps being after more than a decade
Gungrave HYPE!
No price and no pre order date for Xbox ally X  it's less than 4 weeks to launch what's the issue are you struggling for stock or scared off the price
I could have stayed asleep. Xbox had me wake up early for that?  Score 6
No Halo 7 announcement wack
WTH we joked about Xbox having no game, and they respond by actually having no game
Sudden Strike 5😌🤷🏼‍♂️
This show was awful
😏
Konichiwa mini san xuboxu no Cerah desu
Too nice to also mention Steam and PS5 👍
Ori and starfield for ps5 phsycial
Forza Horizon 6 is not set in Albania, I'm outraged
Forza Horizon 6 🇯🇵😍
What is the price for the handheld?
WHERE IS BREAKDOWN 2??
Xbox:  5 seconds of Forza Entire world:  🤑🤑🤑
Worst conf
OMGGG!!! FH6!!!
Here we go again… another year… nothing major Xbox original IP announced. Random indies to fill up the game pass.   Only “big” thing they have is OuterWorlds 2, don’t consider it an Xbox game. It’s an obsidian game.  Followed up by a poor teaser of next Halo thing. With a release date of 3-5 years, why bother.
After this show we lay off more people because we make so much money
Takumi : here we go again. forza initial d style let's goooooooooo
Forza Horizon 6 📢 Hope there will be  a proper realistic car destruction like in the Wreckfest game.  If it's going to be another race of tanks with an arcade like, 0 damage then big skip for me and millions of players. 🏎️
Reduce console prices
Forza horizon 6 ❤
Gungrave, Fatal Frame, and Ninja Gaiden, what a beautiful day. Also a training mode for NG4 is amazing, just like The Void in DMC5, I love that so much.
Forza Horizon 6 is most likely still in development. Therefore, in fact Playground Games There's nothing to show. Because it's most likely in the alpha or beta testing phase in the middle of the studio.
im happy abt the forza 6 (actually my friend is, cuz i care abt silksong lol)
The way he said 👌🏻 China
No Fable news.... again, No Gears E-day news....again, No Halo news....again. sigh, really not bothering this year are they 😑
WHY CANT I WISHLIST IT ON STEAM. IT BETTER BE COMING TO STEAM
Rog ally?
@Xbox Srsly? One minute trailer after years of waiting. Are u fckn kidding me?
New Banjo Kazooie, New Conkers bad fur day and new killer instinct when?
Holy ass batman
Disappointing stream but W on Forza announcement
Metro ??? What's going on ???
Forza Horizon 6 in JAPAN? I'm sold without even seeing gameplay...
and no.. sadly, the cat didn't die yet
fable 4, xbox rog ally x no price yet still, this is wild
Disappointing
fh6 finally 🙏🏻
🤮🤮🤮presentation
Should have atleast given a trailer for forza!
Cool!
So hyped for fatal frame
Forza🎉🎉🎉
Forza 6 is epic! Other games are shit. That's it. 1/10 show More like SHIT SHOW
3 weeks until the handheld launch and still no price? Something's not right.
" I hope you enjoyed the showcase, thank you for joining us, we hope all of you are reminded why it's so unique to be a gamer on Xbox... we'll see you.. on the next Xbox showcase
15 minutes before we even see the first game and yet you *still dont' fix your damn framerate*    How did this become a Playstation: SoP Wolverine W
Gay😊
Yoo
Bring back obscure older titles
All of that for like 10 seconds of forza horizon 6
L
forza 6 YEAH
L
first
Mejor nos hubiéramos ido al state of play
🎉🎉
