Please stop using the phrase "ball in hand"  It is not part of table tennis terminology.  The only sport in which is it is used is pool.  If this is an attempt to make table tennis cool,.it is extremely disrespectful to the sport.  Would you seriously consider commentating at Wimbledon and saying "Federer has ball in hand".  Of course not.
