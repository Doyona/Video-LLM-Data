(Previous Fun Fact: Ex-Machina) Yves Fun Fact #30: She was a trainee for 3 weeks.
this is my ringtone and it's hard to pick up the phone because I just wanna keep listening to it
Guys I think she needs some space
I just realized that the sound and concept Yves been creating for herself solo is just amazing. it's so clear and yet she is still super creative. alot of Kpop groups and especially Soloists don't have a solid sound/concept/image that ties all of their works together
I always come back here when I just need some space 💚
Vocals be hitting real different now. Strong and powerful!
I hate the ai but the song is firee
Did you know that i just need some space?

Isn't this the group that sang, "What Does the Fox Say?"
no one, even yves herself, can top the artistry that goes behind during the I did and even with the release of soft error, i fear I did is yves's magnum opus

사랑스러운 창백함
이런 전자음악 장르가 케이팝이 좀더 발전시켜야할 장르인듯 충분히 독보적인 장르로 남을수있는데 허구한날 외국빌보드 레퍼런스함
I don't even know what to pick out the sample at the beginning the vocals the outfits the sets this entire mv was and always will be so iconic
LOVE HER
