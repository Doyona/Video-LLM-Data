🎉🎉🎉🎉
A Reece is a rare breed
im probably a slime and always had been since day , i love A-Reece wholeheartedly but guys let's be honest. This guy is not investing in his music videos, especially this last two one's "BRUCE WAYNE & VING RHAMES" . He made this music videos as if  the tracks are dedicated to his girlfriend. Especially BRUCE WAYNE i was expecting something creative and massive. Everyone please don't get me wrong! I wish this message(opinion) to get straight to A-Reece
Jody you bad man, I see the Nolan references
Good
I liked A-Reece music since day one
Ish this guy keep killing SA Rappers 😂
Y’all are so inspirational💯🔥
Ten years from now this will still remain a classic 💯🎶🐐🔥
what a record🔥🔥🔥
make 3 to fuck 4 minutes bro you got bars from 🏴‍☠
You should thank me

Dope visuals Keep em coming   Let's run the NO'S up Slimes

Niggas couldn't rap so they fled to the Yanos (Who?) How the fuck should I know? I was busy keepin' it alive out in Lagos🌃 Niggas switchin' sides to survive, that's what I know🤧 Niggas know the vibe when I rhyme with bravado🥵  Niggas say they love it only when they dab, that's a hypocrite🫣 Disrespect the culture for some clout and some dividends 🥶 I ain't sayin' never change your sound, just don't be dissin' this😮 Bet you comin' back this time around just 'cause you need some hits😅 Fuck it, who knows what the reason is All I know is that this time around I'm with the syndicate All I know is that this time around we causin' dissonance I just had to let you niggas know that we up in this bitch  [Outro: Zephbeatz] Yo Reece, it's Zeph Yo man I've been bumping this album man, it's amazing, it's incredible bro But I'm tired of these raps, man I'm really tired of these raps Bars, bars, bars Rappity raps, rappity raps Come on man, you gotta give me somethin' for the ladies man When last you give me somethin 'for-, give me somethin' for the huns bro Man I need something I can dance with my girl with Come on boy, give me something for the ladies

Cape Town
Ouh noo baby boy really a hazard
I might be fishing but I feel like reece is trying to tell us his side of the story through these visuals cause in the end of the video somebody took rickelle away from reece and reece work up with blood on his shirt which could be meaning that somebody in the twc didn't like rickelle so they were trying to separate them making reece the bad guy. But let's wait for the next visual to get clear sites

P2 IS A MOVIE🎞🔥🔥
Lets get the boy to 300k subs ❤
What a week it’s been, my daughter came over to visit me, Baby Boy dropped an album, got featured on the 50th Hip Hop anniversary podcast and now we have Bruce Wayne visuals🔥🔥🔥 what a time to be alive!!!♈️
Watching this new video, it's almost as if I'm witnessing a cinematic experience, and I can't help but perceive "Paradise 2" (P2) as more than just an album; it's evolving into a full-fledged movie. As the visuals unfold, I'm struck by how intricately they interweave with the overarching storyline of the album, akin to how a plot unfolds in a film. BRUCE WAYNE 🦇
Africa's best rapper
Nice work ⚡️⚡️
Clean visuals bruv
Thank you Reece❤
Big on big 👏
mxaa grootman o mxaa ahh .😭😭😭🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
To be continued???

Nah these are beutiful visuals fosho😭😭😭🤣 I don't remember when last did I saw my Goat without a cap and glasses🔥🔥
Are we getting part 2 of this music video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥coz it can't end like this
What are you up to Reece?…
If you don't understand this music video, lemme break it down for you, in the comics Bruce Wayne lost his parents ( loved ones) and that created a rage, and he became batman, this is A Reece living his normal life then they take the one he loves, then on the next episode he becomes the cape crusader (batman).
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😤😤😤😤
This is creative ❤😢🔥🔥✨
Oh my gwad this guy is a genius 🔥🔥🔥🔥now the outfit makes sense
Thank you A-Reece💯🔥you one of the best to ever do it, it's not a debate❤
yoooo these visuals.😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑

"Niggas couldn't rap so they fled to the Yanos"😮‍💨
This is art!!!
🔥💚♀️🤘
so controversial
S/O Jay Jody and Ronnie Lombardi😮
The title of the album is "the big hearted bad guy" I could see the theme by watching this video
COOL VISUALS
🔥🔥🔥
P2 is THE BEST ALBUM IN SOUTH AFRICA. IF YOU DISAGREE GO DEBATE WITH THE PERSON IN THE MIRROR 😢❤
Ohhh sh***t Issa movie🔥🔥❤
Rickelle's acting skills are bad though 0:20. It's a given she's expecting someone to come at the balcony. Maybe I'm wrong it was already intended to make her look like she's luring The Boy
P2: AUDIO FILM 🎥
The whole game should thank HIM
Nahh A Reece deserves flowers.😔
happy to see you without a hat🥺🔥❤️
Let's goo ❤❤❤
Best in Africa
Oh shit its story driven give us a "to be continued" my liege
The boy is a man
🥇❤🤟🏿
